1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,130
Okay, that's better. I've been talking this whole time, by the way. I've been muted the whole time.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,239
My GoXLR was not activated for some reason. Let me, let me restart that. Let me do the whole thing.

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,359
Let me do that entire, like, four- I was wondering what he was reacting to what I was saying.

4
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:34,700
What I was saying was, hi, how are you? I need a better title. Like, I was freaking out about the

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,880
title because the title was awful. It was like a placeholder for when I got here. But anyways,

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,320
people saying 420, 420. Listen, I don't, I don't let the calendar dictate when I'm gonna fucking

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:54,170
smoke, okay? I, I don't, I don't pick when I'm gonna get high based on what calendar day it is.

8
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:01,270
But frankly, I don't even know how to type on the keyboard right now. I have absolutely no idea

9
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:10,299
where I am. I'm, I'm sober as a fucking stone right now, okay? Relax. I'm not high. I'm completely

10
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,900
fine. I haven't, guys, I know that's a meme on the channel at this point. No, I'm not.

11
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:29,769
I don't know. This music doesn't help, by the way. Not the one you're hearing now,

12
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:39,640
this one. Bro, I promise, it's 420, but I haven't done anything. And yes, this is admissible in

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:47,859
whatever court you want to hold this up. Yeah. This is the background music from Monbizo.

14
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,980
Monbozo. How do you say this? Monbonzo? Bonzow? Let me pronounce, give it to me so I don't fuck

15
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:06,810
it up the rest of the screen. How do I say it? Monbozu. Monbozo. Monbozu. Monbozu. Monbozu.

16
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:20,949
Okay. I got it. Uh, but yeah. No, I'm not high on 420. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. I do think I

17
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,629
may have come up with a really cool, no, no, I need a title. Stop making, I don't want to go off

18
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:30,500
on a tangent or what, a title. Monbozu? What's a good title? What's, what's going to grab people?

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:40,020
What's going to grab them? How do I feel today? I feel okay. We'll see as we go on. I honestly

20
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,879
think it might've been like a seasonal thing. Over the last couple of weeks here in Vegas,

21
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,639
it's been ridiculously windy. Three or four, five days a week over the last like two and a half

22
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,580
weeks. It's been like 30, 40 plus mile per hour winds every, like every other day. I'm imagining

23
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,860
with the seasonal change and all the crazy wind, maybe it's kicked up a bunch of bullshit.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:18,840
I don't know. Okay. How about, uh, let's drive. Does anybody really care about my titles at this

25
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:28,280
point? You know, like almost, almost like almost 12 years later. Imagine needing to come up with

26
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:41,610
like a title for your book 4,000 times. You know what I mean? I have, I have a thousand videos I've

27
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,930
uploaded on YouTube of like five plus years ago, right? Like 10, 12, 11, 12 years ago or whatever.

28
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:54,969
I've streamed like fucking a thousand, 2000 times. I'm talking about two to 3000 book titles.

29
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:00,039
They can't all be good. In fact, half of them weren't. So whatever. How about let's drive.

30
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:16,019
That's fine. Doesn't matter. My titles are awful anyways. Let's make it car. No, let's drive is

31
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,800
fine. Let me tweet too. Oh, also I think I've, I got something interesting. So I didn't want to be

32
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,009
late today and I had to go to the bathroom. So I think I came up with a really cool thing.

33
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,459
You can call me a weirdo if you want, but that's fine. So I, I like to have a coffee before I

34
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,060
stream. Just like a little, like an espresso or like one, just, just a coffee to get me kind of

35
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:49,910
going. Um, and I had to go to the bathroom really bad. So I drank an espresso while I took a shit

36
00:04:49,910 --> 00:05:03,639
today. It was kind of cool. I kind of liked it. I don't know why. Is that like weird? I mean,

37
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,379
that's kind of weird, but like what there was, there wasn't anything wrong with it. Like one

38
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:15,670
of my mods just, I think freaked out. You cannot tell chat certain details of your life. It's okay.

39
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:30,920
You know, over the years, like I've got these great mods, right? That help out a ton.

40
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,040
There's lots of people in this community that help out that and a ton of their time, you know,

41
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,259
hitting me up about stuff and helping me do things and all this, right? They're awesome.

42
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,569
I have a, I have a manager, right? I've got a production manager. I'm starting to realize

43
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:49,050
that like a lot of people try like, Hey, hey, dude, dude, dude, hey, tone it down because like

44
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:56,680
what you just said is fucking weird. I never had this kind of feedback. I just kind of was weird

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,660
to you guys and everyone was, I just thought like it was normal. Community Jake will kind of give

46
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:17,139
me some like, Hey, did you happen to say this the other day? Yeah, don't say that. Okay. It doesn't

47
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,779
happen that often, but it happens like enough for me to realize that like, Hey, should I have told

48
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:28,839
everybody that I drink an espresso while I take a shit? But I'm okay. I fuck around a lot on stream.

49
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,399
I do. I tell fucking stories. We make up jokes. We make a bunch of shit up. We just have fun.

50
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,040
That's the whole point of this stream. But in between the nonsense, like I'm telling you some

51
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,000
some truths and this is true. This is not like, Oh, he's making that up for like a funny bit on

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
stream, right? A lot of times it is that you'll hear me. We go over all kinds of weird shit, right?

53
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,819
I brewed an espresso today and I shit while I drank the espresso. And I felt like I couldn't,

54
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,180
I had to tell somebody that I had couldn't lie about that. I couldn't like pretend that didn't

55
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,459
happen. I could not pretend it didn't happen. You know, I like have to confess to somebody.

56
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,139
And you guys are some of the first people that I've seen or talked to today.

57
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:27,079
Holly doesn't even know this. I didn't have like time to explain it. I didn't have time to tell

58
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:41,540
Holly this stuff. But you know, all right, so we're going to do mon bison, mon bazoo.

59
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,149
And the whole time I was doing it, I'm just waiting, just relax. I'm here all day.

60
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:55,430
The entire time I was doing it, I kept saying to myself, I don't know, it was almost like I was,

61
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,100
I was doing it. I was like, Oh, this is weird. But I'm doing, but I kind of, I think it's that cool.

62
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,470
I was holding the espresso cup. Cool. Cool. I had it like tilted in my left hand. I'm just

63
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,689
sitting there like acting cool. There's nobody who cares. I don't know why I was doing it.

64
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:34,789
Okay. Mon, I was gonna say car game, car driving game. How do you spell it? B, A, zoom. What about

65
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:54,139
a cigarette? B, how do you spell it? B, B what? Cigarettes on the toilet. No, I wouldn't. Okay.

66
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,220
Even if I did smoke, I would never smoke in my house or in my apartment or anything. That

67
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,059
shit. No, that builds up. And then, no, that's gross. I was smoking in a house. No, thank you.

68
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:15,179
Okay. Mon, nobody has told me how to spell this yet. I guess I could just look over here,

69
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:22,649
couldn't I? There it is. People asking, enough like fucking around. People are asking how I'm

70
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:29,429
doing. I'm okay. I just figured I could stream. I didn't want to, if I got up today and spent the

71
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:33,509
day kind of figuring out how I felt and I feel fine, then I'm not just going to be like, Oh guys,

72
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,100
I can't stream today. It would be, it would be bullshit. So, cause I told you I wanted to stream

73
00:09:41,100 --> 00:10:04,409
today. Okay. Let's do it. All right. Real voice. Yeah. Good to go. I think we're good to go. I

74
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:12,659
opened the game just to see if it worked. And by the way, you get a face cam if you've done your

75
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:29,419
homework, which I can't, I don't, I can't confirm that you have. All right. This is Mon Bazoo.

76
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:41,559
So, those of you wondering what this game is, is a game where you have to fix and build a car

77
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:50,659
and then race the car. It's kind of like, I don't know. We'll see. What kind of shirt should I have?

78
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:03,370
I don't know. What color? Okay. I'm kind of a gray Andy. 80% of my wardrobe is gray and dark blue.

79
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:12,809
Is that okay? Let's see. How do I, is there a punch? I can go to sleep, but I don't think

80
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:19,419
I should probably, I shouldn't do that right now. No, I mean, unless we can confirm,

81
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,429
unless we can confirm that chat has done their homework for tomorrow,

82
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:33,269
I'm not turning the face cam on. I don't have any electricity. What? No water. There's no water

83
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:41,820
and no electricity in the house. Mods, can you do a quick poll that says, did you finish your

84
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,990
homework? And if it's more than, I'm not going to tell you the percentage that I have in my head,

85
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,210
but just run it. Cannabis packager? Calm yourself. You need to sit down to use the pack. Wait,

86
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,649
weed grinder? Oh, it's this Easter. I forgot it's a happy Easter. Isn't, was it yesterday, the day

87
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:12,779
before? There's E to use. There's a total of zero pack of joint close by. There's no harvest basket.

88
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:25,429
You want to try to roll air? Okay. Should I do the Easter stuff first? How do I stand up?

89
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:33,669
Should I get the Easter stuff first? Okay, so mouse scroll is to move it around.

90
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:46,379
Can I open the fridge? Oh shit. What's in here? I thought this was ground beef. Yeah, don't lie.

91
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:59,269
Seriously. Poutine and maple syrup. Maple syrup, poutine, energy, anxiety. All right. Well, let's,

92
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:19,350
I'm not doing that yet. Is this a Canadian game? I guess it is. Judging by that. Okay. Let's go out

93
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:34,809
here. This item can't be recycled. So I have a truck. Can I go in the car? What am I supposed to

94
00:13:34,809 --> 00:14:02,379
do? Okay. Is it in drive? Where's drive? I don't, I don't know. Manual transmission guys.

95
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:09,659
Where's drive? This is four wheel and two wheel. Is this in drive? What is drive?

96
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,690
It's a manual. I don't know how to drive a manual. Is it the park? Oh, the parking brake was on.

97
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:42,409
The parking brake was on. Okay. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Okay. Um, do I have a map? You're

98
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:51,019
a 15 year old. I did not, I guys, I drive, I drive a car every day. All right. You, I'm turning the

99
00:14:51,019 --> 00:15:04,139
cam on for this. If you give a video game to your parents and you say, Hey mom, dad, I want you to

100
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:10,940
drive around in this car game. Okay. Your parents, even though they drive fucking like 80 hours a

101
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,299
week, whatever it is, I drive like a hundred fucking hours a week, a hundred, probably like,

102
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,330
no, way less than that. How many, okay. Like if you put like a couple of thousand miles a month

103
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,330
on a car, which is like probably like a hundred hours a month, I don't know, whatever it is,

104
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,899
you, your parents are going to sit there and go like, I don't, I don't, this just doesn't make

105
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:39,750
any sense to me. Uh, uh, junior, junior, how do I do this? And your fucking mother drives you

106
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,509
wherever you want, right? She, she has for years. You're my, my parents did for years.

107
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,549
They're not going to know what the fuck they're doing. They're going to have absolutely no idea

108
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:54,360
what to do. My dad used to, we would, when GTA three or GTA four, whatever it was, GTA three,

109
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,240
I would watch him play it and he would be sitting there going like this with the controller in his

110
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:07,350
hand. Like tap, tap, tap, tap. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did I, I just hit that person and he would

111
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,419
just drive into walls and shit. And this guy, this guy like commuted every day. So come on.

112
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:34,330
You can't give me that much shit about this. What does a four wheel drive and get out of here?

113
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:46,259
Okay. For the love of God, I don't, I don't even need this truck anyways. I don't care.

114
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:52,250
Need to reverse. I've, what does this take place in fucking Europe or something? Like,

115
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:59,320
hold on, let me see what this car is. Okay. All right. There we go. All right. Here we go.

116
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:15,579
A car reverse neutral drive. What the hell's going on in that truck? How do I not have electricity?

117
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:43,589
Hey, what does this mean? I don't know. I've never driven one of these before. So let me,

118
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:49,769
can I even, God damn it. I think I have to restart the game. Why would this, why is there a ditch

119
00:17:49,769 --> 00:18:04,539
right here? I can't. Okay. What is reverse in a truck like this? Four wheel drive. This, this one,

120
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:16,039
three, two, three, four. What's, what's reverse? Three, two, one. Where is the shift?

121
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:33,319
He's a city boy. I'm honest to God. Where's reverse? Is that pedal right there? Reverse?

122
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:45,640
Oh my fucking God. Okay. I don't, what are you? It's not clearly labeled. All right. I'm just

123
00:18:45,640 --> 00:19:01,109
going to go. What am I looking for? All right. Where am I right now? I have a hundred bucks.

124
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:19,099
Where am I? He's driving with his knees, crash incoming. I just don't know where I am. Do I

125
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:27,849
have an indicator on the map of where I am? Where's my house? Okay. I see the wind turbines.

126
00:19:27,849 --> 00:20:02,150
How much gas do I have? Half tank. This is not even possible. What? Put it in four wheel drive.

127
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:26,390
Quick. My anxiety went up. Come on, go. All right. I'm fine. Um, sigh, another fall joke.

128
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:34,089
Okay. So that's the river. Hold on. I need to get like a better view. Should I have it in four wheel

129
00:20:34,089 --> 00:21:01,000
drive and four? Well, I'm off roading right now. That's fine. This is an old German. I got,

130
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,589
I don't fucking know what to do. I don't know where I am in the game and I don't have any

131
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:29,529
instructions. Okay. Here's the wind and this is a road, right? All right. So this road has to be.

132
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:48,700
All right. Just stop the fucking car. Turn the fucking car off. It didn't break. Dude,

133
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,549
why do I have to play like fucking ping pong to put the car in park? Does this car even have a

134
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:17,880
park? Okay. I see the wind turbines. So I need, do I have like a compass? I don't know what

135
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,880
direction I'm facing. I'm on this road that's on that kind of right side there where the wind

136
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:32,630
turbines are. I guess I could follow the road down to go to this parfait. I'll try that. I'm

137
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:46,740
just going to follow the road. He's an automatic Andy. Okay. How many people here? There are 13,000

138
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,500
people here. I guarantee you. I guarantee you only like eight of you know how to drive a manual.

139
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:19,220
I'm serious. What is wrong with the car? Yeah. How many of you guys know how to drive a manual?

140
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Fucking none of you. The parking brake is on. Oh, I didn't, did they do their homework? I didn't

141
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:41,940
even look. Did they do their homework? Okay. Here's the split. I need to go to the right or

142
00:23:41,940 --> 00:24:08,869
left. I think to the left. Okay. You need to shift up, please. I got it. It's Monday at 1230.

143
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:30,359
You're going to stall out the engine. I don't drive trucks. Shift to second. Shift. I don't

144
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:38,710
want to go that fast on this road. Don't you understand? Oh shit. What's this? The brake,

145
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:54,019
please. What's going on here? Is this on the map? I need to call them. Where's my phone?

146
00:24:54,579 --> 00:25:06,970
Do I have an inventory? Do I have a phone? Do I have a telephone?

147
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:18,200
What? I just spit? What the hell was that? All right. Let me look at the controls for a second

148
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:29,160
because I, there's no, I don't know what anything does. Smoke. Say sorry. Say a French slur. Spit.

149
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:57,299
I don't think I have a telephone. Can I get around this? I don't think I have a phone here.

150
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:05,220
All right. One, two. Oh, there we go. Dash is reverse. And then I have all the gears. There

151
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,220
we go. I don't have to look down off the road. All right. So I have, I can't go here for a while.

152
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:26,900
So let's put it in reverse. Let's get out of here. What the fuck is happening?

153
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:36,410
God damn it. I, who uses that? I guys, I haven't, I'm sorry. I'm not in a Ford commercial.

154
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:42,410
I haven't used my parking brake to park on a hill in the entire time I've ever owned an

155
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:57,400
operated vehicle. Can we get face cam back? Okay. You can. All right. So I can't go that way.

156
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,079
I wish there was a little blip where I was. I'm going to go back and go left.

157
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,220
I'm going to run out of gas too. This is going to be a disaster. Oh, what's this?

158
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:32,460
Jim's You Pull. How do I get in here? Can I get in? Is this on the map? Jim's You Pull.

159
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:56,920
It's not on the map. You're not friend enough with Jacques to get here. Oh,

160
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:13,529
well don't Jacques. Am I up there? Top right. Hit Y. I think I'm up in the top right. So if I go

161
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:27,180
this way, I should hit Parfait. I don't even know how to go home. So this is all right. So if I go,

162
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,259
if I just keep going this way, I'll end up at Parfait, right? I think that's what's going to

163
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:55,450
happen. Let's find out. We're in the webcam one. Okay. Do I have like an objective list?

164
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:07,579
Fucking God. I am never going to get over that. I'm going to have the parking brake on every time.

165
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:16,890
So let's keep going this way. What does the maple syrup indicator mean?

166
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:37,109
How do you look like that? Because I turn 40. Probably before you are like 25. Okay. I'm hungry.

167
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:56,619
Oh shit. Okay. There's no damage. It doesn't matter. All right. We're at a split here.

168
00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:04,599
So what does this look like on the road? All right. So if I go right, I'm going to go over to

169
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:11,819
Jeve. If I go left, I'm going to go down till I hit another split and then I want to go right.

170
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:26,259
Where do I want to go? I don't even know how to get back to the house. Go to the city. Okay. So

171
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:35,609
to go to the city, I want to go left and then drive until I hit another kind of fork. And I want to

172
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:49,859
go right at the fork, right? I want to go left here, right? Please help me. You should go home

173
00:30:49,859 --> 00:31:01,319
and eat. Yeah. You left here and then keep making rights. Yeah. That's what I figured. Hopefully I

174
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:14,599
have enough gas to get there. Go left and drive past two rights, then right. All right. Here it is.

175
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:32,420
Here it is. Here it is. So go keep going on. It's not on the map. Left is right. Left. And then

176
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:46,329
I can't read this map. Turn right. I think you lost, bro. I am. I just, I don't know how I even

177
00:31:46,329 --> 00:32:08,150
got over here. Is that, okay. Ariette. Oh shit. It's the town right there. All right. I got it.

178
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:29,240
I got to, I got to the road. I got to the road. Right. Oh, okay. Don't be fucking idiot. It's not

179
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,220
a driving game. I mean it is, but you know what I mean? All right. So I made it to the town. What's

180
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:55,559
what is here? Is this where I came from? What's here? We work on the farm. Serve yourself. I got

181
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:09,349
a potato. I have a to-do. What did I get? What do you mean to-do list? How did I get a to-do list?

182
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:32,579
Curds cheese pack. Okay. Remember to pay. I think I am. I spent 20 bucks. I need gas too for my

183
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:47,769
truck. This is going to fall out. What is that thing? I think I'm good. I need a gas station.

184
00:33:47,769 --> 00:34:13,340
They're still in there. All right. Gas station. What does that sign say? The cam is blocking.

185
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:25,769
Oh, where should I put it? I don't see a gas station in this town. And let me see it on the

186
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:41,110
map. I am like in that upper left quadrant, right? Oh, what's this? Can somebody like fuck the car?

187
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:56,699
Oh, post box. Do I have a mailbox? I don't think I have a mailbox. How do I get to my like to-do

188
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:14,389
list? I don't even know what that was. I quest friendships. Okay. Brother gas owner and mom. How

189
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:22,139
do I pull up-is why? How do I pull up the quest menu? Every time you clear your throat,

190
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm going to play one game of Hearthstone. Snack delivery. Oh, I need to figure out how to get

191
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,440
back to the fucking house. You know, I'm just going to walk around because what's the point

192
00:35:50,440 --> 00:36:06,329
of wasting gas? Okay. Snack delivery. Five dollars for poutine. Oh, I just ate it. All right. Cool.

193
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:12,869
So I just ate. I wish I could like fucking mark on the map where this is. I think it's the one

194
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:24,739
that's circled 10 out of 10, right? So if I'm right there, I wish I had just knew where I was,

195
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:33,610
what direction I was facing. Okay. Let's get in here. So I now need to eat or drink maple syrup.

196
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:55,059
Is that how that works? You have an, had an egg snack. Other car located. Is this a gas station?

197
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:03,480
Ooh. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I found something. How much is gas?

198
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:11,619
Weather we have today. Yes. Well, anyways, thanks for stopping by. Have a nice one.

199
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:23,769
This is also expensive. What am I supposed to do with this? Um, coffee cup, eyelashes.

200
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:44,710
Hold on. I can put a car eyelashes on. All right. Wait, I want this. Okay. What do you, what?

201
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:58,019
Normand, leave me alone with the racetrack. There's nothing. What else do I need here? Okay.

202
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:06,860
So this is where you get the equipment. Window tint or green windows. What do you think?

203
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,260
I probably shouldn't spend any more money to be honest.

204
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:30,380
Next one. This is unique. How do I store this stuff? I don't know what this is. I'm taking this,

205
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:45,670
whatever it is though. I don't know what any of this stuff does, but I'm just going to take

206
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,400
as much, as much free stuff as I can fit in the trunk. Cause I don't know what this stuff does.

207
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,670
And I need to put gas in the car too. What about over here? What's this mixing paint?

208
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:17,480
$30 per can. What the fuck? This is stealing. I'm, I mean, this should be fine. Can I take anything

209
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,090
else? All right. I got to remember where this is. I need to start to put this into long-term

210
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:29,219
memory. Cause I'm going to drive around in a gosh darn circle or almost 45 minutes in without a funny

211
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:33,780
joke. You missed when I flipped the truck 400 times and went in the ocean. Sorry. Sorry. You

212
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:50,460
came late to the stream. All right. So now let me close this and put some gas in the car. I

213
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:59,059
probably shouldn't be on four wheel drive either. Right. I get $36. What side is the gas tank on?

214
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:34,409
Left side. What? What do you mean the store is closed? What are you talking about? Can I sleep

215
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:52,679
in the trunk? Do I even have enough gas to get back? How do I get, how do I get home? Okay.

216
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:04,150
Where's my house? I, from here. Can you guys please direct me? You actually, I actually don't know,

217
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:18,969
Wald. So if I'm on that top left kind of quadrant over here and my house is across the kind of lake

218
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:28,760
down, right? Just go right. Just take rights. Okay. I don't, I don't have enough gas to fucking

219
00:41:28,760 --> 00:42:04,739
get out of here. I'm just going to sit here. Just sit at the window. Can you get hit by a car?

220
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:11,110
How long does it take to get to the morning? Go to the church. I don't have enough gas to go.

221
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:16,869
This is going to be a fucking disaster because you understand I am, I look at my gas tank.

222
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:27,510
How do I zoom in? I'm not going to get anywhere. Walk to the church. Oh God. I'm going to forget

223
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:46,409
where the fuck this is. All right. I'm going to church. That's gross. I can't, I don't even

224
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:56,139
think there's a run. This is making me think of the hot dog guy. I'm just saying I can do,

225
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:05,619
I can do it quick. It's in the air and it comes back down. Fastest hot dog shooter.

226
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,659
Hey, I don't know. I've never seen anybody do it like this in the Northwest. I don't know.

227
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:20,940
This is closed. I'm actually just going to be walking around until it's dawn. I've seen,

228
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,090
oh, I thought you said you've never seen that video. You know what's really wild thinking

229
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:33,750
about that? There's not, I think a person on earth that has not seen the fastest hot dog

230
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:42,969
shooter video. Imagine knowing that every single person on earth has seen that video and you're

231
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:57,590
that guy. Every single person on earth has seen that video. That's kind of crazy. All right. I

232
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:03,260
need to get out of here. Even I, should I just restart the game? Go back to your truck. You're

233
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:14,489
going to get robbed. You can wait, you can get robbed. Are you serious? Yes. Oh my goodness.

234
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:33,099
Don't even tell me. Do I have a weapon? I have a flashlight. How do I run? Slender man. All right.

235
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:58,329
I went this way. Can I do AMPM? I don't, I don't, I don't like the 19. I, I like to see AMPM. I have

236
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:07,500
to burn into memory how to get back here. Where the fuck am I going? Where's my truck? It was the

237
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:22,599
other way. It was, wasn't it right down this way from the church or was it that way? Gas station.

238
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,500
It was this way. I'm so useless without a fucking map indicator. I swear to God.

239
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:37,849
Where's the gas station from here? There's something behind you. There's nothing behind me. I'm

240
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:54,440
fine. It was, it was this way, wasn't it? Watch out. We literally saw it. There's no sprint either.

241
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:10,599
I just missed it. How could I, I don't see it. Where is it? This is the snack place. Okay. So

242
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:23,739
it's over here. Remember I go, I got a snack. Ah ha ha. And then I kept going. There it is.

243
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:51,659
What do you mean? Did you not hear that? I don't hear anything. Holy fuck. What? What? What? What?

244
00:46:51,820 --> 00:47:07,530
I'm in the car. I'm safe. Drive, drive, drive. All right. All right. All right.

245
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:44,260
All right. How do I get out of here? I don't, I can't, I don't know. I can't read that.

246
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:54,039
Take the bus. It's almost midnight. Get out of here. I don't, you guys are fucking with me.

247
00:47:54,039 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm hearing like sound. Okay. Should I just go this way? How do I turn my headlights on?

248
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,840
How do I turn the headlights on? Okay. It's a flashlight. I don't know. How do you turn on

249
00:48:12,840 --> 00:49:07,769
headlights? Can you fucking imagine holding a flashlight to drive? What's that say? Guys,

250
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:34,650
there's no car light. Oh, there we go. I got it. Okay. If I follow this road, am I going to end up?

251
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:51,260
Okay. This is residential. Do the German nine eight five here a bit. I can't do that right now.

252
00:49:51,260 --> 00:50:13,619
Don't stop at the barn. Run. Am I on the right track? I can't, this lights are terrible.

253
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:30,889
I can't take a left because this stupid ditch. I have to find the road where there's no ditch

254
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:50,869
right here. I'd be honest. Am I actually going on the right? All my shit just fell out. I'm

255
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:57,429
restarting the game. I'm re I'm going to restart the whole game. I'm restarting the whole game.

256
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,480
Now I get it. Now I understand what's going on. I'm restarting the game. I'm just going to restart.

257
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:13,179
Just redo the game. Let's restart. I'm restarting. Yes. I quit. New game. Okay. Now I get it.

258
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:33,639
Okay. Where's my. All right. Am I on the map? So this is my truck. This is the car. I have to

259
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:42,340
like do work to this car, right? I need a tire. How do I get to the task menu? Does it even exist?

260
00:51:42,340 --> 00:52:07,579
There's a map. I don't think there is. Go to the shed bro. Build the sugar shack. Buy a roll of

261
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:20,070
tubing. Connect 10 maple trees to the shack. Okay. Build a sugar shack. Very. All right. Here we go.

262
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:30,309
All right. Okay. All right. What the fuck was I driving around for no reason? Look. Okay. To do.

263
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:45,639
Use the tool adjustable spanner to screw bolt. Okay. Screw bolt. I do that on the car like down

264
00:52:45,639 --> 00:53:11,849
here, right? Yep. Okay. Very nice. Happy 420. Hey, happy 420 man. Yeah. One of those days. Can I

265
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:39,030
store stuff? Make this easier. These are so rusty. I put this here. Is this done? Yeah. I was going

266
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,659
to place all the screws first and then maybe I can actually drive this fucking thing and actually

267
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:52,440
drive an automatic car. My God. Those things are the same color as the ground. The screws.

268
00:53:53,079 --> 00:54:20,809
Whatever. I'm not going to. Why would I restart? I'm fine. I need one more. There we go. Okay. So

269
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:29,460
now that I have the tire on, does this thing have an engine? Very cool. All right. So this is to do

270
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:51,619
right now. Install the intake back on the engine. Intake. How do I open the hood? I need the wrench

271
00:54:51,619 --> 00:55:24,730
to do that. Inside the car. Oh, there it is. Open the fucking hood. What happened to my wrench?

272
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:47,880
How do I open the hood? You need to use the hoist. Hoist puller. Place it on the ground.

273
00:55:47,880 --> 00:56:10,659
Patch it to vehicle. It was just a button. You fucking whackers. Whatever. Okay. Do I have to screw

274
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:26,780
it in? Oh, it's a generator. All right. So what happened to the wrench that I had? Install the

275
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:42,579
intake. Torque the wheels. Dude, I had a wrench and it's just fucking gone. Where is my wrench?

276
00:56:42,579 --> 00:57:04,940
Is it right there? Where? Dude. Okay. I don't know where the wrench is. I have absolutely no idea.

277
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:37,590
Do I not have an inventory? Look down. Guys, it's not here. It's by the car?

278
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:59,659
Ha! Bruh, I can't. It's not on the screen right now. I'm being dead serious. It's not on the

279
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:07,050
screen. It's not on the screen. I dropped it somehow. Is it like in my hand? Is it like a wrench

280
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:19,369
button that I took? I stored it? Look down. Dude, we are at a bird's eye view. The wrench is not

281
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:55,349
on the ground. I'm, I think it's fucking bugged. I don't think it's in the, I don't think it's here.

282
00:58:55,349 --> 00:59:04,420
I'm going to sit right here and I want everybody just to fucking tell me exactly where to go from

283
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:22,119
right here. I'm going to wait 10 seconds every time I ask. Behind the shed. You motherfucker.

284
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:28,039
You got to be kidding me. It's, uh, yeah. I, I never stepped, I never went over there.

285
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,880
I was never behind the shed. I, it bugged through the wall or something. Whatever. Who cares? Let's

286
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:55,559
go. All right. I need screws. I gotta screw this in, right? Short-term memory loss. I didn't even

287
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:03,639
go back there, dude. All right. How do I, um, is it 12? Is it, or is it just, okay, there we go.

288
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:34,679
Right there. That's in. I think I need like two or three. Bingo. What? One more. There. Okay.

289
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:42,860
Need more? When are you going to play Strawberry Magic 2? Okay. The people that are disrespecting

290
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:53,079
the streamer on telling me to play Strawberry Magic 2, I want them timed out. Um, is it, is it in?

291
01:00:53,079 --> 01:01:22,699
I think it's in. Should I just close the hood? Are we good? Um, how do I, how do I say like,

292
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:25,579
uh, what else should I do? I screwed it in and do I have to do anything else?

293
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:35,320
Uggy part. Screws. Um, I don't know how to, like, solidify this. I need more screws. Really?

294
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:52,039
Oh, I don't know. It's right below you. Yeah. It looks like there's no more screws I can put in.

295
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,300
I don't think there's any more room for screws. How can I fit in here?

296
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:24,550
It screwed in. Are you mad at me? Look towards the black box? Oh, there we go. Okay. There it is.

297
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:35,110
There's my, there's my mon-bizow. Okay. Engine's in. Torque the wheels. I don't know what that

298
01:02:35,110 --> 01:03:00,539
means. I think that's what it wants me to do, right? City boy. None of you guys here know any

299
01:03:00,539 --> 01:03:09,699
of this shit either. Please. Some of you probably, some of you that do are sitting there going, I do.

300
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:17,300
You fucking bozo, right? But most of us have no idea what's going on here. Buy a tire pump at,

301
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:29,590
okay. Buy a tire pump at Cali Gas in town. Build the sugar shack. Let's go ahead and

302
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:39,460
just do this part first. I need a tire pump at Cali, Cali Gas in town. Does this car drive now?

303
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:55,980
Or do I have to take the truck? This has got no gas, so never mind. Don't take the chain,

304
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:07,769
so I'll put it in the shed. Why is he so mean today? I'm not being mean. I am handling a toxic

305
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:30,820
community. Take the gas can. Good call. I'm kidding. You guys are fine. Relax. Somebody said,

306
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:38,579
damn right. Get out of here. Relax. Okay. So, so where I am right now, I need to go to the gas

307
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,260
station. So to go into the gas station, don't go that way. It's just go to the main road,

308
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:48,360
which is that way over there. I have plenty of gas. I got my gas tank. I've got plenty of money.

309
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:54,039
I'm going to eat and drink something. That was a hard day's work on the car. I'm going to drink

310
01:04:54,039 --> 01:05:06,300
this coffee. I'm going to spit into the toilet and miss and hit the ground and not clean it up.

311
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:16,260
We're going to go with our gray shirt today. Let me make sure I'm fully okay. I'm good. All right.

312
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:44,739
Good to go. We move. Remember this road. Burn it into your memory right now. This is loud,

313
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:50,659
isn't it? Day nine of German not reading my messages. I just read it. Sorry. You're going

314
01:05:50,659 --> 01:06:16,329
to reset it. Okay. So this is now the main road. So this is a left. By the way, that's not a very

315
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:32,260
long counter. That's not that long. Do you understand? I said I was going to play paper

316
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:38,300
Mario like three years ago and somebody's been waiting for paper Mario every day. Do you

317
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:48,809
understand? It's just that like there are people that were waiting like two years for me to play

318
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:53,159
Cheeto, which understandable. I said I was going to play Cheeto like a year and a half ago and I

319
01:06:53,159 --> 01:07:14,980
never did. What the fuck? I'm waiting for paper Mario. I don't think it's ever going to happen.

320
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:22,630
I just don't think so. We're fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just don't freak out. Just let it go to

321
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:58,650
four wheel. The fuck is the road? You literally own the switch online. Just play it. Okay. I lost

322
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:27,460
my gas can. Was there anything else in the back of the car? Dude, where is the gas can? My God.

323
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:34,380
Is it the other way? No, I took this. I took the chance out. We're good. Other way. Oh my fucking

324
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:56,579
God. Disrespect me again and see why I'm on that today. Where is it? It's not. Hey, there it is.

325
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:13,460
I got it. And right now that person right now is going like I like go over I go and you can see

326
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:20,500
them through the windshield like and then they turn to the person in the passenger side and they're

327
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:30,649
like fucking idiot. Piece of fucking shit. What a dumb fuck that guy is. Fuck that guy. And then

328
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:47,319
as they as they're pulling away, it's like, yeah, good job, man. And then like, oh, and then and

329
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:57,779
then I go on like a 25 minute rant about like society and like humanity. The person writer.

330
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:16,060
Wrong way. This is the right way. This is the right way.

331
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:41,770
Um, am I I'm going the right way, right? I don't know. Oh, shit. Sorry. Hey, I go down. I grab my

332
01:10:41,770 --> 01:11:03,859
phone. Oh, my phone. Hey, I think no, this is the right way. Isn't the church over there? I actually

333
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:15,539
think I might have turned around. I don't know. No, it's not. Can I drive by this? How do I hit?

334
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:48,380
No, please. No, please. I was going the wrong way. Gas. It's in the trunk. It's right there.

335
01:11:48,939 --> 01:12:11,560
Stop distracting me. Oh, my God. I can't fucking play this. Did you lose the gas can?

336
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:26,359
I can't fucking play this game. If the game does not have a map indicator, I can't play it.

337
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:32,760
I have to be honest with you. If I can't see a blip on the map right now, I can't play the game.

338
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:51,979
It's not possible. There it is. I got it in the cab. Yeah, there's no map indicator. I can't play

339
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:58,170
the game because I'll get distracted and look over here and like, look at you while I'm still

340
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:04,180
holding W turn like this and then look back this way. And I think I'm on the same road that I was

341
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:22,180
when I looked over at you. So it's not happening. You should just do paper Mario. You wouldn't

342
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,979
survive 23 hours in the wilderness. Yes, I would because I would just eat fucking bugs and dirt

343
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:34,090
and I'd be fine. You don't need a map to eat bugs on the ground. Excuse me. I would be just

344
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:45,300
fine. Did you never survive like in the wilderness 24 hours? I would eat bugs on the ground and I

345
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:53,670
would live. Okay. Next question, please. I don't need a map to figure out how to eat fucking like

346
01:13:54,630 --> 01:14:17,800
stuff on the grubs on the ground. Sorry about that. I wish there was a horn. Yep. Still funny,

347
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:30,170
I guess. This is not even remotely where the town is, though, by the way. Like, do I even have a

348
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:37,060
compass? I don't even know. How do I get to the fucking town? The gas station is going to close.

349
01:14:37,060 --> 01:15:10,420
Hurry up. This person thinks I'm fucking chasing them. I'm driving in a giant circle. I don't

350
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:29,770
think this is how you get to the fucking town. I've been. Oh my fucking God. I've been driving

351
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:45,340
around in a circle, the bottom left. Okay. So where the fuck even am I? There's three of those

352
01:15:45,979 --> 01:16:01,109
silo places. Am I driving straight now? Just keep going straight. You actually need waypoints.

353
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,720
I'm sorry. There's one road to get to the town and there's no compass and there's no. The map is

354
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:16,520
just like a map that I. It's like Elden Ring. It's like the Elden Ring map. And to get to Lunaria,

355
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:23,289
I have to. Whatever. North, south, east, west. They've had that since the fucking stone age.

356
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:48,899
Where is it? There we go. Take a right? What the fuck? I just wish I had a compass.

357
01:16:54,489 --> 01:17:09,689
Cavemen were looking at the sun like burning their eyes and going like, oh, that way. You need to use

358
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:35,720
the sun. Okay. Oh, there we go. Hey, I don't. I found it. All right. All right. All right. All

359
01:17:35,720 --> 01:18:09,399
right. I need, I need to go to the store. The store was over here. I remember the school. Hey.

360
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:13,770
Okay. What did I need to do? I needed to buy something from here. What did I need to buy?

361
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:22,489
It was something from here. Don't you don't close yet. It was some kind of a torque thing, right?

362
01:18:22,489 --> 01:19:28,020
Pire pump. Thank you. Why not? I don't want to buy super. How do I fill the tank? Take the cap off?

363
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:53,449
How made the wrench? Uh, it's, they're going to close in fucking one second. You just get gas in

364
01:19:53,449 --> 01:20:44,170
the car. Okay. Take this off. I got the tire pump at least. Okay. Um, how do you fill the gap? Do I

365
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:51,979
have to actually go in here and say, can I fill this? They're not closed yet. Do I have to like,

366
01:20:51,979 --> 01:21:07,579
how do I, I wanted to fill this open the cap. I, there's some special fucking like sit around

367
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:23,979
and do a seance to get the cap to open, steal the gas. I can't. And guys, where did it take the

368
01:21:23,979 --> 01:22:04,310
nozzle off the can? How do you, but how do you do that? The other one? God damn it. What is this?

369
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:18,890
What the hell is that? What, what is this? What is the item? I'll be back tomorrow motherfucker.

370
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:39,939
And I'm going to fill this. I'm out of gas. Yeah, I know. Take the, but I thought I could just go

371
01:22:39,939 --> 01:22:46,619
over there and like press E. It says like E to U. I don't, I don't, I'm trying. I, I don't know.

372
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:51,979
I had to like unscrew the cap. I, I come over to this fucking thing and I'm pressing it. First of

373
01:22:51,979 --> 01:23:01,590
all, it says, sorry, you don't use that, that like pleb gas. I got the tire pump. Who cares?

374
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:33,239
Where's the, okay. Okay. So what's the fastest way to get back to the house? That way, the,

375
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:39,739
this way, right? There's the church, but bro, I don't even know what direction I'm fucking facing.

376
01:23:39,739 --> 01:24:14,970
Absolutely not. You have a map. I don't know what road I'm on. I don't know what road I'm even on.

377
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:33,399
I'm like in the town up here somewhere. Okay. Is the church on the map? I can't look closer.

378
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:52,600
I'm going to growl in a second. Snack bar. Okay. The snack bar is circled at like, as like 10 out

379
01:24:52,600 --> 01:25:00,699
of 10. So I'm on, I can't even point at it. I can't even show you. I think I'm on the road.

380
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:08,310
That's like to the bottom right of 10 out of 10, right? So I need to go straight left, right,

381
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:26,390
straight left, right. Let's see if that works. Straight left, right. That not right. This is

382
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:40,890
the school bus straight, right, left. I think I'm going the right way is now. Wait, is it that road

383
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:59,609
right there? Cause this is now, bro, I have no idea. You pass the bus to get in, but then I'm

384
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:10,789
going to be on this. This is really far away, isn't it? This is the wrong bridge. Yeah. Now I'm all

385
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:37,930
the fucking way left. Okay. So I passed this, but I drove around in a huge circle. I'm not going to

386
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:52,789
have enough gas to get home, let alone come back here and fill the tank. Left was a shortcut.

387
01:26:52,789 --> 01:27:07,399
I'm not going to be able to drive the car back here. Why do you have Fulbright on your webcam?

388
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:31,430
I have auto exposure on. I don't know. Am I in four wheel drive? You need to take, I'm literally

389
01:27:31,430 --> 01:28:42,069
driving the worst possible way to get back here. Oh God. I'm just, okay. First of all, where am I

390
01:28:42,069 --> 01:28:49,430
on this map right now? Where, where is, where is my fucking house? Where is my house on this map?

391
01:28:49,430 --> 01:29:14,920
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? What is it called? It's called roulette. Okay. Roulette

392
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:24,100
means my house. Okay. That's all I need to know. So if I go left on this road and then go right

393
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:33,989
and then go left, I'll be in town. It means trailer. So I go left, just bang right. Don't

394
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:44,760
go down this stupid ass highway. Left, stay right and then left and then get into town. I got it.

395
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:58,170
Okay. Get me the fuck out of here before I freak out the fucking goddamn door. Put the stupid gas

396
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:03,220
tank in here. I'm ready. I'll fix the car up in a minute. I'll fix the car up in just a moment.

397
01:30:03,619 --> 01:30:07,619
I'm not going to get angry. I'm just going to relax. We're just going to go and it's, it's,

398
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:15,829
it's literally left on this road. Hang a right and then hang my first left. I can take, I'll be in

399
01:30:15,829 --> 01:30:23,319
town. Left, hang a right. Let's go. Let's go. Everybody relax. Everything's fine. This is,

400
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:27,420
this is it right now. We're going to go. Nobody yell. Nobody freak out. We're going to, everything's

401
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:41,659
going to be just fine. Okay. Everything. We're good. Hey, see, see, I'm happy. Fucking

402
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:48,979
I'm 36. We don't fucking freak out. It's a video game. I turn, I'm 36 years old.

403
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:53,220
We don't have fucking temper tantrums over like not being able to know where the parking break

404
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:57,619
is. We relax and we're an adult now. We're an adult and we've been an adult for a long time.

405
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:12,760
Don't run into the school bus. Okay. So no, no, no, no, no. Go this way.

406
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:28,539
I am now on this road. We're going to go left. Remember this. This is like the little, like the

407
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:41,510
Moses split the fucking ocean. We're going to go here. Here we are. Okay. We are now at this

408
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:46,630
intersection where we're going to go left. Stay, don't go that way. Stay left. Stay straight over

409
01:31:46,630 --> 01:32:01,960
here. Left, right. Stay this way and go. Okay. Left and go. Very easy. Simple. We're good.

410
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:11,829
We're good. Don't freak it out. No, like dry out of a clips. We're good. We're good. We're good.

411
01:32:11,829 --> 01:32:16,630
Everything's fine. Now we're fine. It was easy. It was just simple. I just didn't know where my

412
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:22,550
house was. I didn't know that roulette meant house in fucking French. I got my compass. Now

413
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,869
that's all I needed. Remember this. I do. All right, everybody. We're good. We're good. We're

414
01:32:26,869 --> 01:32:31,479
good. We're good. We're good. We're good. No, fuck. Just don't fuck.

415
01:32:34,819 --> 01:32:57,850
Okay. Can I put this in the glove box? So now I need to pay attention because take a look at this.

416
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:06,420
Ready? I am right now. I wish I could point with my mouse. I, I am right now right at the little

417
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:12,819
tip of the bottom of the top Island. Right? So if I drive straight on this road and then

418
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:17,579
I got to remember, let me burn this into my memory right now. That mountain right there,

419
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:22,140
this one right here, drive towards that mountain and have that mountain be on your left here on the

420
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:30,329
right spot. The church needs to be on my right. Going out mountain right there. There it is.

421
01:33:30,329 --> 01:34:00,939
Got it. Abstinence Andy. Mountain peak, mountain peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain

422
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:04,939
peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain

423
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:09,420
peak, mountain peak left. I will never forget it now. I made it a stupid fucking song and let me

424
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:39,899
like make it so I'm not like a fucking red Andy here. That's better. All right. All right. We can

425
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:43,340
now play the game now. I apologize to everybody that came here and said I'm fucking leaving this

426
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,800
stream. This guy sucks. If you came back to check, you probably didn't, but I'm, I'm now playing the

427
01:34:47,800 --> 01:35:09,739
game now. Question is from the church. Who's that? It's not going anywhere. What's up? Some cars make

428
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:17,000
so much noise. Ew. Can you find something for me, please? I take a walk this afternoon. I can look

429
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:34,920
for your object. I didn't lose anything. Did I? You only have $80. That's interesting. All right.

430
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,560
I gotta hurry up before the sun goes down because I'm restarting a third time. That would be an

431
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:59,430
embarrassment. I'm not going to run somebody over for fun. Okay. The gas station is now down here.

432
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:05,289
So it's just straight to the gas station. Don't look at the snack bullshit. Don't go over there.

433
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:34,810
Right here. It's just straight. No, it's not. Okay. It's a left at the snack shack. We go straight

434
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:48,069
and then it's a left at the end of the snack shack road. He's so mad. Um, I am. I am. I'm trying to

435
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:57,180
calm down. I really am. I'm trying to relax, but I'm so fucking heated. Okay. Where's the gas station?

436
01:37:13,159 --> 01:37:20,310
School bus was there and then it says snack shack, but this, the gas station is all on here.

437
01:37:20,949 --> 01:37:25,109
What do you mean? Ludwig's coming. What do you mean? All Ludwig for directions. What do you mean?

438
01:37:25,109 --> 01:38:37,899
What's Ludwig coming? I got it. Give me fucking gas. Stop. Stop the car. Stop the car. So what

439
01:38:37,899 --> 01:39:33,239
do I do now? Okay. Please screw this back on. It took him two hours to do this. Dude, give me a

440
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:47,270
little bit of a slack here. Okay. This is confusing. Okay. I have gas. I want more gas in this car.

441
01:39:47,270 --> 01:40:05,130
Give me this. Open that up. I want more gas. Get out of the fucking car. Is this actually working?

442
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:32,779
Turn the car off. How much is the bike pump? How much is the bike pump? All right. Okay. I only have

443
01:40:32,779 --> 01:41:13,100
$6 left. Is that bad? Broke ass. I made it before they closed. Hey, it drove into a house. All right.

444
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:25,539
Do I have everything I need? Okay. What was that fun song that we sang? Mountain peak left. Just

445
01:41:25,539 --> 01:41:49,930
find the mountain peak. Save the game. Uh, how? It's not that one. It's over here. There it is.

446
01:41:50,569 --> 01:42:11,579
Got it. Okay. Mountain peak. It's be on our left. So now we just drive on this road. We go through

447
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:32,619
the, the Moses pass, which is right here. Well, no, no, no, not quite. So now we are at this

448
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:47,420
intersection. We stay to the right. Wait. No, we don't. We go. Yes, we stay right. Yes, we do.

449
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:53,430
Stay to the stop lying to me because I'm at that. We stay right. And then I drive on this road

450
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:58,729
forever. Wait. Yep. And then here we go. Done. Done. Done. We're good. We're good. We're good.

451
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:00,810
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.

452
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:03,609
We're good. We're good. We're good. I'm not going to let you guys gaslight the fuck out of me right

453
01:43:03,609 --> 01:43:29,779
now. Not when I'm this upset. Here we go. Here's the Moses split. Get it. Finally got it. Everything's

454
01:43:29,779 --> 01:43:44,279
fine. Right? Yeah. This is worse than the unlocked stream. Oh, it's not. You're out of your mind.

455
01:43:45,739 --> 01:44:02,170
You've, you've gone, you've gone hollow. If you think that. Thank God. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

456
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:27,930
Let's go. Where's the gas tank? Oh my God. Finally. There's a gas tank. Let's do it. Oh my God. I

457
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:50,250
finally can drive the car. This is working. I'm not fucking doing that till I'm certain that's

458
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:57,319
happening. Okay. I know it's on. Yeah. I'm not doing that till I'm 100% certain. Where'd the

459
01:44:57,319 --> 01:45:09,539
cat, where'd the gas go? I'm not certain that that's actually working. So I'm just going to

460
01:45:09,539 --> 01:45:17,640
sit this down. Okay. I don't know if that's working or not. So I'm afraid to do that until

461
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:35,350
I'm certain. So let's, let's do, let's fix the goddamn car. Good. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good.

462
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:44,890
Very good. Very good. Very good. The wrench, the wrench out here. Let's go. This is big progress.

463
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:51,340
It kind of, it is. It really is. I wish I could pick up more than one thing at a time though.

464
01:45:57,109 --> 01:46:02,869
Every screw is going over here. This is worse than the unlocked stream. No, it's not. And you know

465
01:46:02,869 --> 01:46:08,630
why it's not? Because you couldn't even read the text in the unlocked stream. It was not even

466
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:12,789
visible. You couldn't read it. And that was the whole stream was you being able to read the text

467
01:46:12,789 --> 01:46:21,159
on the cards. There's no way this is worse. Not a chance. Not a chance in fucking hell.

468
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:47,619
All right. Let's go. All right. Bingo. This dude's hair makes him look like he got back from a parent

469
01:46:47,619 --> 01:47:07,720
teacher conference. Oh, what is it? Parent teacher conference hair. I don't, I wish I knew. I, I'm

470
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:12,550
too old to understand what that means. What's that supposed to mean? You're, oh, parent teacher

471
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:26,090
conference Andy. Why do I like just picture like a bunch of kids laughing at me right now?

472
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:32,409
Doing the loud kid point laugh thing where they go ha ha ha ha like loud.

473
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:47,060
Really? Parent teacher conference. And I'm just sitting there with like suspenders on.

474
01:47:47,060 --> 01:48:11,800
Look at this guy's hair. I don't even, what do you even mean? What are you, who, who,

475
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:32,600
what are you on about? Wrong screws. I'm going to fix this car and I'm going to play this game.

476
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:53,750
And I'm telling you right now, it's going to be epic. Um, you just, I need to put the car up so

477
01:48:53,750 --> 01:49:45,529
I can get underneath, jack the shit up right now. Where does it go? I don't, I fucking don't

478
01:49:45,529 --> 01:50:25,689
understand what's going on with this goddamn thing. Give me the, is that bad? That in? Okay.

479
01:50:25,689 --> 01:50:38,789
That's in. I think there's one more that I have not tightened. Here we go. Okay. The engines in

480
01:50:38,789 --> 01:50:46,420
there. What the hell do you want me to do now? Pork the wheels with this thing, right? I got it.

481
01:50:46,420 --> 01:51:12,729
I got it. I got it. We're good. Do power generator and save the game. I don't think this has any gas.

482
01:51:12,729 --> 01:51:38,729
Does this have gas? I can't tell. I don't know. Uh, is that halfway? So I have to start it. I think

483
01:51:38,729 --> 01:52:28,010
it's on. All right. Power the computer. Chill the computers. I want to save. Hurry up. Okay.

484
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:36,680
Save the game. Thank God. It took two hours to save the game and be at a place where I'm good.

485
01:52:36,680 --> 01:53:25,270
Oh my God. Thank God. We're playing age of empires. Okay. So now there's a good bed. Okay.

486
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:40,489
It's Monday. Still raining. I have potatoes and shit in the car. Right. Deep fryer. Okay. All

487
01:53:40,489 --> 01:54:04,699
right. All right. Right. Let me do this too. Put it in the fridge too. It's 12 AM. What I'm bringing

488
01:54:04,699 --> 01:54:17,689
my groceries in. Oh, I put 50 curry. Oh, I didn't want to do that. Okay. We're good. Should I have

489
01:54:17,689 --> 01:54:40,779
not put those in? Should go back to bed. Hold on. Listen to shed. All right. I think everything's

490
01:54:40,779 --> 01:54:45,020
out of the truck. There's only one more. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Everything's out of the truck.

491
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:57,989
Do a trampoline stream. Okay. Close this up. Should I put the cheese in here? 100 curds cheese in

492
01:54:57,989 --> 01:55:05,260
there. 0% French fries. All right. Here's the French fry cutter. You're missing a frying basket

493
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:22,439
in the deep fryer. Do I have a frying basket? I probably should put these in here because the

494
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:42,840
won't they go bad? Um, all right. So do I have to don't lose that potato? I only have one potato

495
01:55:42,840 --> 01:56:12,579
for the love of God. Is it in the sink? It's not in the sink. Do I need to buy a fry basket?

496
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:29,140
But do I have one here somewhere? I don't think I have one. Well, I'll just put it in the fridge.

497
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:39,369
Figure that out later. Is it in the sink? I mean, if that's it, I can't. No, that's like a sink

498
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:58,680
thing. Frying basket. I don't think I have one. Turn the light on. No, I don't have one. If I do,

499
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:03,909
it's in a place. I don't know where it is. Okay. All right. Uh, that car is almost ready to go.

500
01:57:05,739 --> 01:57:12,899
I don't know where it could be anywhere. It's the square basket in the. No, I don't have one.

501
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:31,909
I'm just gonna go back to bed. Okay. It's almost time to get up. Can I turn the computer off? Yeah,

502
01:57:31,909 --> 01:57:52,710
turn that off. Lift on Martin. Ask Martin for a lift. Martin is sleeping. Try later. Wait,

503
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:55,510
you'd mean to tell me that I could have just gotten in somebody else's car the whole time?

504
01:57:56,149 --> 01:58:20,329
It's 3 a.m. Hold on. Can I change this to? I don't think I can. Oh, dude. 144. Ow, my ears.

505
01:58:21,289 --> 01:58:28,220
We're almost there. All right. Let me just. I can work on the car a little bit more now.

506
01:58:28,779 --> 01:58:34,409
All right. So that was the wheels. What's now? I have to pump the tires up, right?

507
01:58:35,739 --> 01:58:46,520
Talk to your brother, Francis. Um, plant a tree, find some seeds, harvest a plant, make a cannabis.

508
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:59,180
Wait, I got seeds. Where's my brother? Is he on the map? Okay. Do I know where Francis is?

509
01:59:05,239 --> 01:59:15,289
Potato is gone. No, it's not. Right there. Brother's name is Francis. I don't see Francis on here.

510
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:40,010
Parfait. Does this mean like one of these mean brother? Brother is top right. Top right. Okay.

511
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:48,810
So I need to go right on this road and then bang a right and then bang a right and stay on the road.

512
01:59:48,810 --> 02:00:00,680
I got it. I don't think it's actually top. But don't lie to me. Where is it? That was a lie. Oh.

513
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:12,970

515
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:34,420
Or is there like a note with my brother's phone number on it? Martin. I'm just gonna call mom.

516
02:00:34,420 --> 02:01:02,039
Maybe mom will know. Snack delivery. Need driver. Okay. 2109 room cleaning will be done.

517
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:20,970
I'm just coming to clean my room. Okay. Uh, plant the potato. Where can I plant the potato?

518
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:47,590
All right. What's this? Stick it in the ground. Coupler. I probably put, I gotta put gas in there,

519
02:01:47,590 --> 02:02:15,289
but not yet. So how am I supposed to know where my brother is? A potato seeds. So where should

520
02:02:15,289 --> 02:02:24,180
I put these? Can I put them anywhere? I'm back here, right? All right. I'm going to put my potatoes

521
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:56,439
like over here. I need the shovel right here. Holy shit. Let's go. Got water too. We've rains coming

522
02:02:56,439 --> 02:03:13,930

523
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:36,060
I'm gonna drink something first. Pass bow. Is that brother? Where? This one's low left.

524
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:42,819
All right. So does he just take, go left here? That's where he is. I should have enough gas.

525
02:03:42,819 --> 02:04:11,899
So he's right here on this road. That's not brother. All right. Hold on. Let me take a look.

526
02:04:11,899 --> 02:04:32,500
So right now I'm about to pass pass bow. Uh, let's keep driving. It's there. They're lying to you.

527
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:45,560
Okay. All right. Looking in town. Well, this is a house right here. Let's see. Let's see if he's

528
02:04:45,560 --> 02:05:10,939
here. That's probably him right there. All right. Who the fuck are you? How's your day going? Can't

529
02:05:10,939 --> 02:05:30,520
wait for summer. Each weekend I will go out camping for sure. Okay. You can sell firewood here. All

530
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:42,939
right. All right. So now can I drive that other car? If I put gas in that car, can I drive it now?

531
02:05:42,939 --> 02:06:07,720
Place firewood here to sell. How do I get firewood? Uh, do I have to buy like an axe,

532
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:13,659
chainsaw? Can I cut down any tree or do I have to cut down specific ones?

533
02:06:13,659 --> 02:06:29,100
Just hit a tree with your truck. I'm going to go get the chainsaw because I need money. I don't

534
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:54,229
need. I have $0 man. Am I on gas on this car? I'm okay. So I'm going to load this truck up with a

535
02:06:54,229 --> 02:07:07,510
shitload of firewood. That sounds good. The parking brake is not on. All right. I got to stop looking

536
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:16,380
at the chat room when I'm driving a vehicle. That would be fucking swell. Oh my God. Don't even

537
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:52,899
fucking tell me we're good. Okay. Chainsaw please. Now does this thing have gas too? Like does this

538
02:07:52,899 --> 02:08:17,100
thing have gas or is it just going to work? I can't cut this. Uh, okay. Well, what about over here?

539
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:30,489
Gas too. It's only the dead trees. This is a birch tree. All right. So that counts. Okay. So now

540
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:38,140
I'll load this up. I'm good. This is going to be sick. Let's go. I'm just going to pull it over

541
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:54,920
here. No, I'm not. Just walk it. I have to cut it again. Cut it until it's okay. All right. All

542
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:15,539
right. Let's go. How much do you get per, uh, per thing of wood? I need to use the log splitter.

543
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:19,460
Well, I got to, I'm going to load the truck up and then I'll take it from here.

544
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:28,170
Right. I'm assuming the green circle is how you turn it into firewood, right? Nobody here knows.

545
02:09:28,170 --> 02:09:51,800
It's behind the house. I don't think so. Let me just check something real quick.

546
02:09:51,800 --> 02:10:05,289
No, okay. I can't cut it anymore. It's the red thing. Guys, this is like a trailer. This is a

547
02:10:05,289 --> 02:10:17,500
trailer. What are you talking about? Am I high? Are you high? This is not a log splitter. This is

548
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:29,779
a coupler. You attach it to the back of a truck. It's not, I think, what are you? Oh my goodness.

549
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:43,060
It's not a wood cutter. This is the thing you attached a trailer to a truck. That's not a wood

550
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:52,060
cutter. What do you mean look at it? I'm not looking at it. Bro, fellas, ladies and gentlemen,

551
02:10:52,140 --> 02:11:08,489
that is not a wood cutter. This is not a wood cutter. It is. Yeah, it isn't. Look, I'm not,

552
02:11:08,489 --> 02:11:13,130
I'm not, I don't need to prove this anymore. You guys are losing your minds. You guys are

553
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:19,340
losing your fucking minds. It's not a log splitter. What the, what is happening in this chat room?

554
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:26,760
This is a trailer. What is happening here? Oh, you guys are fucked up. I'm leaving.

555
02:11:44,859 --> 02:11:51,100
Look up a Google image of a log splitter. I'm fucking freaking out right now. Log splitter.

556
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:11,180
This is a trailer. This is, I don't know, I don't, huh? You gotta be kidding me, man.

557
02:12:11,739 --> 02:12:23,529
No, it's not. This is not. I tried to use it. What? You can't be serious, man.

558
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:29,779
No, I thought it was people just fucking with me and just making up random shit.

559
02:12:29,779 --> 02:12:49,770
This is a log splitter. I thought this is something you attach to the back of a truck.

560
02:12:53,720 --> 02:13:13,539
Dude, no way. No way. I thought every, wow. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. How do you turn

561
02:13:13,539 --> 02:13:28,539
it on then? It does both? I've never seen one of these in my entire life. Is there enough fuel in

562
02:13:28,539 --> 02:13:43,609
it? City boy. I'm sorry, but I don't know how many of us here have never seen a wood splitting

563
02:13:43,609 --> 02:14:09,029
machine in their entire life. I haven't. Come on, dude. Apologize. No.

564
02:14:19,819 --> 02:14:24,460
Is he high? I'm sitting there freaking out about this. How do I turn this on?

565
02:14:28,489 --> 02:14:52,539
Do you see how soft my hands are? Look at how soft they are. I've never seen this before in

566
02:14:52,539 --> 02:14:59,909
my whole life. I always just, it's always the guy that's, okay. It's always, anytime I think of

567
02:14:59,909 --> 02:15:08,220
wood cutting or log cutting, it's this jacked guy with like huge pecs and a fucking like just abs.

568
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:13,579
And he's wicked sweating and he's like smashing through wicked hard with an axe. I've never seen

569
02:15:13,579 --> 02:15:28,380
somebody do it with a machine ever. It's always a jacked guy with no shirt on. I've never seen a

570
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:51,420
machine. That's so funny. That's actually really funny. I can't believe it. Okay, turn this off.

571
02:15:51,420 --> 02:16:03,880
Don't waste gas. How much can I put in the truck? Probably a lot, right? Apology. Okay. I'm sorry

572
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:11,800
that I told you guys that you were stupid because I thought that the trailer that you attached to

573
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:17,560
the back of the truck was apparently like a piston operated electronic gas operated log cutting

574
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:51,670
machine. I'm sorry that, but come on, you guys have been messing with me all day though. How am

575
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:59,190
I supposed to know when you guys are not? All right. Give me, I need to make a ton of money.

576
02:16:59,190 --> 02:17:09,719
He's a city slicker. The only, guys, people are doing like, I'm the kind of person that, oh hey,

577
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:14,600
oh yeah, we're going to go up back and we're going to, we're going to build a fucking shed.

578
02:17:15,159 --> 02:17:18,870
I'm like, okay, does anybody need their taxes done? Like I can, I'll help you do that.

579
02:17:21,159 --> 02:17:29,209
I can, you know, I can help with something else. I'm not, I'm not the kind of person that knows

580
02:17:29,209 --> 02:17:35,319
what this is. Like, oh, do you want, I can actually like, you want me to run, what do you need?

581
02:17:36,329 --> 02:17:41,899
You need oil and you need, you need like this like kind of like special kind of like grease or

582
02:17:41,899 --> 02:17:46,649
something that I can go get or you need like, I'll run, I'll run Home Depot. Yeah, I'll be right back.

583
02:17:46,649 --> 02:17:51,989
I'll be back in like 10 minutes. Anybody need coffee or anything? Like I'm, that's me. I'm that

584
02:17:51,989 --> 02:18:15,219
kind of person. That's, I'm that guy. I gotta pull the truck down. Yeah, I'm that guy. You don't want

585
02:18:15,219 --> 02:18:22,250
me to cut the wood. You really don't. I'm telling you right now. I promise you. I, I don't even know

586
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:29,350
how it would happen. I would go to cut the wood and like the axe would come out of my hand and

587
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:35,270
like go flying. Like the handle would break off somehow. Like a fucking, like a comic, like cartoon

588
02:18:35,270 --> 02:19:04,280
style. I don't know how it would happen, but it would. The wood and the meat grinder. You were a

589
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:10,819
gym bro. Like 10 years ago, I, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have cut wood back then either. I still

590
02:19:10,819 --> 02:19:15,319
would have been the guy that goes and gets the coffee. Just because I was in the gym does not

591
02:19:15,319 --> 02:19:20,120
mean I would be comfortable swinging an axe or touching heavy machinery. That doesn't change.

592
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:27,379
I would go like to pour your coffee, you know, and it'd be like this. It'd be kind of hard.

593
02:19:27,940 --> 02:20:01,750
I don't know what I mean, but I'd still do it. Please don't even give me a break. Did you ever

594
02:20:01,750 --> 02:20:05,829
skip leg day? I never did legs once. That's a lie. I'm kidding. Don't fucking be an idiot.

595
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:25,030
Goddamn parking brake is going to make me lose my mind. Okay. I am doing this. I know this is

596
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:29,750
people are going to like, oh, snooze fastism, snoozing. I can't, I wake me up when he's doing

597
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:36,659
so I'm, I'm one try to like, I need money. I'm going to fill this car with this shit.

598
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:40,340
It's going to be to the brim and I'm going to make like $150 at least.

599
02:20:41,059 --> 02:20:55,899
Three trees is enough. We'll see. Maybe one, one more tree. I promise. That's it.

600
02:21:02,459 --> 02:21:10,489
I can't, I, that was visible, audible and mental shock that this was actually a real thing.

601
02:21:14,069 --> 02:21:16,790
Please be okay. Everybody here. Be honest with me though. Be honest with me.

602
02:21:17,350 --> 02:21:23,319
Did you actually know what this was? Like how many of you knew what this, this, this was actually

603
02:21:23,319 --> 02:21:36,659
that, what that is? I've been to Home Depot. I've been to Home Depot a shitload of times too. And

604
02:21:36,659 --> 02:21:40,420
I've never gone to the wood cutting machines and gone and wow, that's interesting. How does that

605
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:46,549
work? No, I go to Home Depot and I walk around in a circle looking for a light bulb and I don't know

606
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:50,629
where the fuck they are until I find the one person that points me to the other end of the entire like

607
02:21:50,629 --> 02:21:56,389
three mile long store. That's like, oh, the light bulbs are at aisle 400 and then I go to aisle 400

608
02:21:56,389 --> 02:22:14,579
and then I leave. All right. Well, last one, one more and that's it. I promise. This is it. Okay.

609
02:22:14,579 --> 02:22:37,579
We're good. This is not efficient, but it's okay. What about Ikea? Well, the great thing about Ikea

610
02:22:37,579 --> 02:22:45,059
is Ikea makes it so you cannot screw it up. You have to walk through the whole store and the store

611
02:22:45,059 --> 02:22:48,180
is like, Hey, by the way, just letting you know, you're walking through this part of like Disney

612
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:54,899
world. You have to walk through everything in Ikea. And there are like Dark Souls shortcuts in Ikea

613
02:22:54,899 --> 02:23:00,540
if you feel like skipping to something else, but you don't have to do that. Like I know that I'm

614
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:06,229
just going to eventually walk into the kitchen appliance section in Ikea. I'm just eventually

615
02:23:06,229 --> 02:23:32,780
going to, it's going to happen eventually. I love that place by the way. Oh dude, all the meatballs,

616
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:49,979
right? All right. That's enough. They're actually really good. And I know everyone's like batch

617
02:23:49,979 --> 02:23:53,500
testing right now, but they're actually really good. Well, pretty much all the food from there

618
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:58,629
is really good. They have like salmons. They have sauces. They have all kinds of meatballs.

619
02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:19,780
It's cool. It's really cool. It's a nice place. It's fine. What's what? It's good stuff. I love

620
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:29,559
Ikea meatballs, Bat Chest. And then when you go to Ikea and you eat them and then you fucking

621
02:24:29,559 --> 02:24:46,659
literally delete all of your like the chat logs. I don't want to even know I said that. They're not

622
02:24:46,659 --> 02:25:03,139
bad. They're not bad. All right. There's a lot. Okay. I understand now when people say, okay,

623
02:25:03,139 --> 02:25:09,350
I'll tell you right now, if I drive on the road and I flipped this car over and it's ruined and

624
02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:16,280
this was like the last like half an hour was a waste of time. I'm going to do everything in my

625
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:24,729
power to make that not possible. Cause this is probably like a few hundred bucks worth of wood.

626
02:25:25,290 --> 02:25:37,590
Put a tarp over it. Can you do that? And this off wasted gas. Stop wasting gas. Bat Chest.

627
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:56,819
Almost there. Everybody hold on. You can wake up in a minute. You know what's really ridiculous?

628
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:05,979
I'm so glad that I was not in a call with somebody. I would have bet money that this

629
02:26:05,979 --> 02:26:16,299
was not a woodcutter. If I was in a call with somebody and they were like, dude, that's a

630
02:26:16,299 --> 02:26:20,860
woodcutter. Like pep and they were saying like Pepe laugh. And you guys were saying Pepe laugh

631
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:25,540
and shit. I would have, I would have been like, fine, put a thousand bucks up and I would have

632
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:57,610
lost. I need to eat something. Save the game. Good call. That's a very good call. Is the rest

633
02:26:57,610 --> 02:27:02,389
of the stream going to be about, can you recognize a woodcutter? No, we'll move on probably pretty

634
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:22,870
shortly here. Probably like now I'll give you $10,000 to flip the truck. No, no, I'm serious.

635
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:39,350
There are 15,500 people here and that would like annoy and like irritate 15,000 people.

636
02:27:39,909 --> 02:27:43,959
So essentially what that would be would be, I would be getting a dollar like per person

637
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:49,299
to like irritate the fuck out of everybody. And I don't, I don't, I kind of don't want to do that.

638
02:27:56,309 --> 02:28:13,000
All right. Well, this is fine. I got to sleep. I need to eat something. I don't think I have any

639
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:22,329
food. Oh, I have this. Yeah. We're good. All right. Let's go see. Should I turn the power off and go

640
02:28:22,329 --> 02:28:50,409
to bed? Maybe you should. I'll give you a thousand dollars. No one's giving me a thousand. No one's.

641
02:28:50,409 --> 02:29:03,180
Okay. Don't even joke. What time is it? Is it really 1 AM? What is the sleep schedule I'm on?

642
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:09,860
Fuck. Well, I'm cutting another. Okay. I'm cutting another tree down then. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to

643
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:18,809
cut another tree down because it won't fit. Actually it really might not. You're right.

644
02:29:20,889 --> 02:29:33,239
Let me spread this out because this will be a disaster. I'm going to go very slow.

645
02:29:33,239 --> 02:29:40,739
I'm going to bring the chainsaw too. There might be stuff at his property I can cut down.

646
02:29:40,739 --> 02:29:53,299
It's not going to be a disaster. It'll be fine. All right. Oh, let's bring the chainsaw

647
02:29:53,299 --> 02:30:21,159
that in the car. I'm not trying to cut this. Go back to bed. I've watched this video on

648
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:39,180
fail army a hundred times. What does that mean? All right. This is empty. So I have to fill that

649
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:43,850
back up if I have any. All right. Here's the plan. I'm going to go make a bunch of money.

650
02:30:43,850 --> 02:31:08,579
How am I on gas? I could use some. Fail army? I saw the stream five days ago. That's weird.

651
02:31:08,579 --> 02:31:37,239
Can I see how much is in there? Empty. Okay. All right. I got a full tank of gas. Okay. We're good.

652
02:31:37,239 --> 02:31:42,819
Full tank of gas. Bring the gas can because after I do this, I'm going to town to get more gas.

653
02:31:42,819 --> 02:31:54,600
Car is almost ready. I can just need to fill it with gas and I can drive it. Do not flip the car

654
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:02,780
under any circumstance. Do not flip the car under any circumstance. Don't do it. It's not funny.

655
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:08,780
It's not a joke. It would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting

656
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:16,020
wood. Jeremy, I know you think you're quite the comedian, but this is not the time to do that.

657
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:26,600
And a lot of people are going to think that that was on purpose, but it was not. And I,

658
02:32:27,639 --> 02:32:31,799
you gotta be fucking kidding me, man. I'm going to quit the game. Honest to God,

659
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:39,559
you don't even tell me that like this is, that's unfucking believable. And it looks so stupid.

660
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:46,620
It's so stupid because it looks like I have fucking meant to do that. I'm fine. It's fine.

661
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:57,819
I can just reverse. That looks so shit and so planned. That looked so fucking fake and

662
02:32:57,819 --> 02:33:21,899
it's annoying that it did. I can't fucking believe it, man. I can't believe it. I can't,

663
02:33:22,540 --> 02:33:31,899
I cannot believe it. Scripted fucking bullshit. I can't believe how fucking fake that looked.

664
02:33:31,899 --> 02:33:54,950
In fact, I can't, I really thought that this did not drop off like this. I thought it

665
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:59,860
was just here and that I could just go left. Because remember, I was up in the truck like this

666
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:03,780
and I'm driving this way and it's like, take the left. I didn't think there was a divot right there

667
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:09,829
and it doesn't matter what I say. I'm like a try hard funny Andy that like thought that was funny

668
02:34:09,829 --> 02:34:27,930
and there's nothing I can do about that. I used a lever. Dude, come on. I, my life is a, I can't.

669
02:34:29,930 --> 02:34:37,940
So scripted and so just fake. He's doing the thing. Look at, he's like talking about like,

670
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:53,850
don't mess it up, Jeremy. I fell down guys. I'm so mad right now. You have no idea. Load the save.

671
02:34:56,170 --> 02:35:28,469
Quiet. Not you, me. Just put it like under here. Would that work? I don't think that's doing

672
02:35:28,469 --> 02:36:50,360
anything. I'm just going to reload the save. Far away. What if I just used it? I can't use it again.

673
02:36:50,360 --> 02:37:15,110
Guys, I'm fucked I think. Put it in neutral. How do I do neutral? All right, all right, all right.

674
02:37:15,110 --> 02:38:00,739
I swear to God, this wasn't on purpose. I promise. I pull it like from here. There it goes. It's

675
02:38:00,739 --> 02:38:19,610
fucked. The back side. There it goes. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

676
02:38:19,610 --> 02:39:08,469
I can't believe it. Can I get out now? I might be able to get out now. I have to reload the save.

677
02:39:08,469 --> 02:39:28,139
Pull the front right. Front right side. No, it's wedged in here. This shit ain't going anywhere,

678
02:39:28,139 --> 02:39:55,020
guys. It's like just stuck here forever. Yeah, this is copium. It really is. Ram it with the ATV.

679
02:39:55,020 --> 02:40:23,370
Now, this is absolute copium and I, this is copium. It's copium. I need to reload the save,

680
02:40:23,370 --> 02:41:16,149
which is, it's this one here, right? Turn off, turn this off. Turn everything off. Go to bed.

681
02:41:16,149 --> 02:41:33,670
I'm not going to get stuck again. I, I will, this is the worst stream ever. That sucks so bad that

682
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:52,010
like I really did not mean to do that. It's like one o'clock in the morning. Just sleep until

683
02:41:52,010 --> 02:42:13,059
six a.m. This was my first stream. Fuck it. I'm done. I'm out. Get in the fucking car.

684
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:26,309
Turn the fucking car on. Put it in one. And this is what I saw before. That looks like a level

685
02:42:26,309 --> 02:43:47,340
fucking plane. What about the gas can? Check that rear view. No, no chainsaw. No, no, no, no, no.

686
02:43:47,340 --> 02:44:03,290
No, I don't have time for that right now. It's the worst stream. Fuck. No, it can't be. No,

687
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:20,090
I'll fix it. I'll fix it. It can't be. It can't be. I'll fix it. Don't go down that way. I'll fix

688
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:42,819
it. I'll fix it. Let's go. I get five bucks for every log. This is going to be a fucking

689
02:44:42,819 --> 02:45:06,120
millionaire at the end of this. Pull it closer. Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer. Oh my

690
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:33,659
God. Thank goodness. Just drive over it. That work. I'm not, no, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm not

691
02:45:33,659 --> 02:46:14,069
fucking around. Does work. All right. I thought you were lying. I have 265 bucks. All right. We're

692
02:46:14,069 --> 02:46:21,159
in business now. Let's fucking go. All right. Plan. Here comes a plan. We're going to get the

693
02:46:21,159 --> 02:46:33,530
plan going. Plan. Load up the car with gas. You're going to come out of the birth canal.

694
02:46:33,530 --> 02:46:50,940
I'm not coming out of the birth canal. Full tank of gas. Let's go. I got 300 bucks. I'm ready to

695
02:46:50,940 --> 02:47:03,799
do it. Let's go. Stream just started. You just got here. Okay. This shit's empty. I need to fill

696
02:47:03,799 --> 02:47:12,920
that back up. I've got a full tank of gas of almost 300 bucks. I can go into town, which led me.

697
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:19,590
Let's take a look here. If I keep going just to the left straight, go through the Moses tunnel

698
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:30,700
and we'll go back into town. It's the worst stream ever. It's not the worst. No, it's not.

699
02:47:30,700 --> 02:48:01,209
I refuse to believe it. Nope. Sorry. Nope. Okay. Here we go. Stay left. Bang a left here.

700
02:48:02,459 --> 02:48:13,540
We're going to go buy some equipment for that car. It can't possibly be the worst stream. He made a

701
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:41,850
silly cats being mean. It's okay. We don't have to listen to them. You and me, we get it. I can.

702
02:48:42,489 --> 02:48:50,840
Is that another potato? No, I do have to. I'm going to buy some snacks. I think because I'm

703
02:48:50,840 --> 02:49:12,180
going to run out of food zero as soon here. Snack shack was down here, right? Isn't the snack shack

704
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:30,729
over here? I don't know, dude. Every fucking house is identical and every road is identical.

705
02:49:34,090 --> 02:50:07,110
One of these houses is the snack shack. Okay. Turn this off. Let's go. Let me just got a damn thing.

706
02:50:07,110 --> 02:50:23,850
Fill this up. I got cash. I'm good. I can buy another gas tank. Okay. So it's 17 bucks to fill

707
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:36,250
this can full can. Very nice. All right, let's go. Now we're working. Now we're working. Let's go.

708
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:42,940
All right. What do I want from here? Oh shit. No, I don't have that kind of money.

709
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:53,270
Um, summer tire. A muffler. I could buy, I could afford one of these mufflers.

710
02:50:53,270 --> 02:51:06,680
Should I get a new muffler? I have a torch. Dent repair kit. Rust repair. Something useful. Yeah.

711
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:15,139
Wouldn't a muffler be useful? What about a shock? Sport shock. Like that would be pretty,

712
02:51:15,139 --> 02:51:28,309
pretty sick, right? Rust repair. Rust repair kit. Okay. Oh yeah. The car is rusted. You're right.

713
02:51:28,309 --> 02:51:47,350
Good idea. What else should I get? I'm thinking maybe suspension. Dent repair. Yeah. I don't want

714
02:51:47,350 --> 02:51:57,159
to buy too much shit though. Another gas can. I don't think I have, do they sell it? It's in paint.

715
02:51:58,870 --> 02:52:03,270
Gray paint. All right. What kind of, what color do I want the car to be? Uh, Robin's egg blue.

716
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:17,670
Now how long does that last? Or do I have to buy like a shitload of them? Does it last forever?

717
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:33,350
Ooh, a steering wheel. Cool. What's that? I'm, I probably should get like some shock or something,

718
02:52:33,350 --> 02:52:58,420
right? I shouldn't I? No, get food. Oh, you're right. Okay. I can't get that. All right. I'm

719
02:52:58,420 --> 02:53:02,260
going to buy a bunch of poutine because I need to buy it. I don't, I can't afford it. I can't

720
02:53:02,260 --> 02:53:08,139
afford it. All right. Okay. Okay. I have enough to, that engine is going to be pretty cool. One of

721
02:53:08,139 --> 02:53:23,340
it. Oh, no eyelashes. Yep. Buy a lottery ticket. All right. I got a full tank of gas, a full gas

722
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:41,420
can, a under glow kit. No shifter. Oh, this is kind of classic. This is kind of classic. No, no,

723
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:45,909
not this one. The other one is all right. All right. All right. All right. I have 50 bucks.

724
02:53:45,909 --> 02:53:49,350
I don't want to waste it because I need gas. I want to be able to afford gas. Okay.

725
02:53:50,659 --> 02:53:58,569
So Snack Shack is right here, right? That's Snack Shack. Yep. Okay. They're right next to each

726
02:53:58,569 --> 02:54:28,040
other. Drive carefully, please. We're good. Vroom, vroom, crappy car mods. Reddit. What the fuck did

727
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:41,379
you say? I'm sorry. I got like really angry. Calm down. Woof, woof, woof, woof. What do I mean

728
02:54:41,379 --> 02:55:04,520
locked? Are they closed? Come on. Are they open in 20 minutes? Worse than Skate 3. Everybody that's

729
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:09,770
saying that this is the worst stream I've ever done. You are going to be timed out for five

730
02:55:09,770 --> 02:55:15,110
minutes for each offense on your. Okay. For your first offense, it's five minutes. Your second

731
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:29,020
offense, it's 20 minutes. Your third offense is permanent. Deal with that one. Deal with that one.

732
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:53,270
Imagine waiting 50 minutes in front of a restaurant to go in. I've done it before,

733
02:55:53,270 --> 02:56:00,870
not 50 minutes, but like it probably 20. So maybe some of you guys can relate to this. We'll find

734
02:56:00,870 --> 02:56:08,780
out. Being on a reverse sleep schedule and having, and like, let's say you, let's say you're getting

735
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:15,110
up a long time. I haven't been like this in a long time, but for a while, especially when I was in

736
02:56:15,110 --> 02:56:22,569
Massachusetts and I lived in Massachusetts, I was sleeping at, I mean, I would start my stream at

737
02:56:22,569 --> 02:56:28,700
seven or eight o'clock at night Eastern. And I, my stream would stop around like 12, one, two

738
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:34,360
o'clock in the morning a lot of times. Right. Every, almost every stream was like that. So I

739
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:40,360
would be ending my stream at like two, three AM sometimes. And like, I would maybe take a shower

740
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:45,450
after streaming and relax. Very good. What am I going to do for food? And there were breakfast

741
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:53,739
places that opened at like five AM. So, I mean, I was, I was essentially on a complete reverse

742
02:56:53,739 --> 02:57:01,909
schedule. I was going to bed at, I want to say I was sleeping a lot of times at like eight, nine,

743
02:57:01,909 --> 02:57:04,389
10 o'clock in the morning and waking up at like four or five o'clock in the afternoon.

744
02:57:06,170 --> 02:57:10,889
So I would, sometimes you, I'm really hungry and it's like, fuck, I can't go, I haven't gone to the

745
02:57:10,889 --> 02:57:17,770
grocery store in a few days. I don't have anything in the fridge. So like four 30 would roll around

746
02:57:17,770 --> 02:57:26,309
and I'd be like, fuck, I'm, fuck, man, I'm ready to go. And I would go and kind of, I wanted to like

747
02:57:26,309 --> 02:57:32,069
eat and I want to beat all the old people to the restaurant because they all showed up at like five

748
02:57:32,069 --> 02:57:39,659
36 AM. So I would get in the car at like four 30, get there at like four 45 and just be like,

749
02:57:39,659 --> 02:57:46,090
I'm ready. And they would open and be like, like, oh, hey, how are you doing? Oh yeah. Good morning.

750
02:57:46,090 --> 02:57:51,750
Good morning. It's sunny out there. I don't know. I don't know what the people maybe thought I did,

751
02:57:53,159 --> 02:57:57,639
but like I was always not always. And I didn't do this that often, by the way, this happened

752
02:57:57,639 --> 02:58:02,500
to make maybe like a total of five to 10 times my whole life. I would be there like at the crack of

753
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:08,870
the door opening and I didn't want coffee, right? Because I was going to be going to sleep. So it'd

754
02:58:08,870 --> 02:58:15,670
be like, no, no, no, no coffee, no coffee. Uh, but I would love the extra large, uh, corned beef hash

755
02:58:15,670 --> 02:58:33,430
and three eggs breakfast place and a big orange juice. I would love it. Oh, it's open. These are

756
02:58:33,430 --> 02:58:48,090
expensive corned beef hash and eggs is my favorite breakfast in the world and nothing compares. So

757
02:58:48,090 --> 02:58:54,700
there you go. I got here right when they opened, I cleaned them out and now I'm leaving. Do they

758
02:58:54,700 --> 02:59:09,500
have anything else? Is there a drive through fry basket? I don't think they have a fry basket in

759
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:26,520
here, man. Okay. I got everything I need. Let's go. Let's go work on the car. Corned beef is

760
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:48,059
terrible for you. It's so good though. But I mean, everything is terrible for you. As long as you're

761
02:59:48,059 --> 02:59:53,909
not eating corned beef for every meal, every day of your life. We have the same conversation. We

762
02:59:53,909 --> 03:00:00,729
talked about like fast food, right? That you eat McDonald's. Fucking piece of shit. You're disgusting.

763
03:00:01,610 --> 03:00:06,090
If you eat McDonald's like a few times a month, you're fine. It's you're going to be fine.

764
03:00:07,559 --> 03:00:27,209
All right. I got to find the exit. This is not the exit. That's copium. That's not copium.

765
03:00:30,149 --> 03:00:34,629
Did I drive on somebody's fucking front deck? What the hell is going on? I didn't lose anything,

766
03:00:34,629 --> 03:00:57,479
right? That's not copium. It really isn't or McChickens. Just do if you feel like having

767
03:00:57,479 --> 03:01:01,879
like a brisket sandwich, eat it, but don't eat a brisket sandwich every single day.

768
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:06,540
If you like chicken nuggets from McDonald's or Wendy's or Burger King, whatever, that's great.

769
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:20,579
They're awesome. Don't eat it every day. There. That's it. Done. Done. That's it. And like taking

770
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:39,239
some more good stuff too. To, you know, to even out the bad stuff. I don't want to. I want. Well,

771
03:01:39,239 --> 03:01:46,739
I mean, here. You could like incorporate. You just incorporate some more greens and shit.

772
03:01:47,379 --> 03:02:04,680
You maybe cook with some like better oil, right? Just keep an eye on your cholesterol. Like whenever

773
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:16,459
you get like a blood test from the doctor, just go right. Make sure you like your, you know,

774
03:02:16,459 --> 03:02:29,700
all your levels are okay and be going, be healthy and be happy. You'll be fine. Or don't eat like

775
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:36,250
shit. Nobody cares. Yeah, but you will though. Let me tell you, as somebody that's old man,

776
03:02:38,309 --> 03:02:45,430
you're going to want to treat your body at least all right in your teens and twenties. Trust me.

777
03:02:47,430 --> 03:03:03,610
You really are. Dad, shut up. I'm serious. Let me be the one to tell you that I said the same stuff

778
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:11,819
when I was like 20, 25, whatever. I don't give a shit when I'm older. Who fucking cares? I'm going

779
03:03:11,819 --> 03:03:31,739
to be old. I'm not that old. 20. Yeah, whatever. You're a wise elder now. Oh, somebody what happened?

780
03:03:31,739 --> 03:03:37,020
Sorry. What happened to my house? Honestly though, did I leave the door open the whole time?

781
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:46,260
You're like 50. Oh, we're going to turn this. We're going to make this a beauty.

782
03:03:48,379 --> 03:04:24,739
All right. Rust repair kit. How do I use it? I only get to use it once. I use it one time. Nice.

783
03:04:24,739 --> 03:04:35,270
Very nice. Okay. Dent repair kit. All right. Is there any major dents to take care of?

784
03:04:35,270 --> 03:04:47,700
Probably. Should I just use it on this car? Like right here? Is this working?

785
03:04:47,700 --> 03:05:07,530
Am I making dents in the car? Oh, whatever. Oh, I'm just going to burp. What do we have on

786
03:05:07,530 --> 03:05:21,659
the to-do list? All right. That's all done. Oh, my potatoes. 36%. Do I have to water them?

787
03:05:21,659 --> 03:05:52,760
What the fuck? That's my car. Should I not do this yet? And is this infinite? It runs out.

788
03:05:52,760 --> 03:06:27,270
It's infinite. It's no, it's not. Test it out. I think it might be infinite. I think so. I think

789
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:31,420
yeah, it's infinite. It is. All right. Well, let's, I know we could do the rust and everything first,

790
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:51,659
but whatever. This is looking all right. Leave some parts while it's cool. No, I want it to be

791
03:06:51,659 --> 03:07:06,020
blue. So I have to buy a shitload of those rust repair kits. We have to do way more wood. Yeah,

792
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:11,540
just eat all right. Don't, you know, if you can, sometimes it can be hard. Trust me. I get it.

793
03:07:12,100 --> 03:07:36,100
It's empty. You actually can run out. Did it go in? That looks way better than it did before.

794
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:43,290
And whatever, who cares? Okay. So now, oh, I got this blue. I'll save that. Can I drive this thing?

795
03:07:43,290 --> 03:07:56,250
Does this thing actually drive? Can I actually drive the car? I can. Oh, hell yeah. All right.

796
03:07:56,250 --> 03:08:33,020
Let's get gas in this thing. Very nice. Pop the trunk. Let's put this in here. Okay. Nice.

797
03:08:33,579 --> 03:08:42,860
Everything will be secure in here. That's so much better than the trunk. How do I get it off this

798
03:08:42,860 --> 03:09:05,620
thing here? I just pull this out. I have to jack it up. Um, how do I, I don't, how do you do that?

799
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:20,819
I really kind of don't understand. That's not a jack. Oh, do I have a jack? Oh, can I just

800
03:09:20,819 --> 03:09:32,809
drive off of it? It's in the trunk. Um, it is not in the trunk. The jack on the front,

801
03:09:33,450 --> 03:09:43,430
it's a log splitter. That's a tire pump. It's a watering can. Wait, there's no water in it.

802
03:09:43,989 --> 03:09:51,239
That's a tire pump. It's in the truck bed. That's another hoist puller. It's not a jack.

803
03:09:51,959 --> 03:10:06,819
I mean, can I just pull it off though? I don't see it. I think that's just going to have to,

804
03:10:07,459 --> 03:10:18,569
I think I have to buy it. Oh, put the food in the fridge. Yep. That's true. I got to piss.

805
03:10:19,209 --> 03:10:35,500
Did you take a fat dump in bed today? Kind of a weird question. A very strange question.

806
03:10:35,500 --> 03:10:49,340
Use the hoist on the front to lift the front. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm going to

807
03:10:49,340 --> 03:11:11,659
run out of this stuff soon too. What's in the freezer? Okay. We're good. We're good. Wait,

808
03:11:11,659 --> 03:11:22,760
if there's no electricity, how's the fridge work? Right. I got to pee. We'll be right back.

809
03:11:23,319 --> 03:11:27,719
I'm not even close to being done. I'll be right back. Give me like two, three minutes.

810
03:11:27,719 --> 03:11:53,159
All my songs got moved. Going to the folder and they're not synced up here. Sorry about that.

811
03:11:53,159 --> 03:16:11,079
I'll fix it. Here, pee. I'm back. I didn't, I wanted to speak really softly so I didn't

812
03:16:11,079 --> 03:16:47,370
scare the shit out of people. The hot boxed his house. Ready? That was a long piss. I refilled

813
03:16:47,370 --> 03:16:55,370
my water and tea. Water and tea together. It's a water. It's a tea. I can hear your hot box.

814
03:17:00,469 --> 03:17:07,670
Okay. So I need to sleep. What time is it? What time is that in? That's six o'clock at night,

815
03:17:08,309 --> 03:17:15,850
five o'clock at night. What is it? So I'm not going to bed yet. What can I do? Let me see if

816
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:37,399
I can get this off the thing here because I don't really want it on there. How do I get this off?

817
03:17:37,399 --> 03:18:18,760
They like bolt it in. Inflate the tires. Oh, that's a smart idea. Keep pumping them.

818
03:18:18,760 --> 03:18:26,489
I don't want it past like 32, 30. What do you mean? 30? You out of your mind? You don't want

819
03:18:26,489 --> 03:18:41,659
a hundred PSI in your fucking tire? What are you talking about? No, like 32, 30. Not, you out of

820
03:18:41,659 --> 03:18:59,079
your mind? 35, 32. Herman has only ridden a bike. All right. I might've gotten the log cutting thing

821
03:18:59,079 --> 03:19:06,040
wrong, but like 30 and 35 PSI on your tires is like safe. It's not, you're not supposed to have,

822
03:19:06,040 --> 03:19:19,370
fucking, are you crazy? I know, I know this. If I know one thing is, is this 70 PSI. I would not

823
03:19:19,370 --> 03:19:28,250
do that. Yeah. Come on. Okay. So now that's good. I need to go. I know what I'm doing before I go to

824
03:19:28,250 --> 03:19:39,450
bed. All right. This game's fun. I am going to cut down some trees and I'm going to make a shitload

825
03:19:39,450 --> 03:19:50,500
more money. How's that sound? Punk. That's right. Yeah. I'm talking to you. No, no, no, no, no, no.

826
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:58,659
On the second seat in the couch. You with the brown hair. Talking to you. Yeah. Put the spaghetti

827
03:19:58,659 --> 03:20:06,420
down and let's talk. Somebody was just like, what the fuck? Somebody's eating spaghetti with

828
03:20:06,420 --> 03:20:14,219
brown hair on the second seat of a couch. This 15 plus thousand people here. The person that was

829
03:20:14,219 --> 03:20:23,899
just eating spaghetti on the second seat in their couch with brown hair. Me? Wait, what?

830
03:20:28,819 --> 03:20:35,540
Do you guys, I don't know. Do you remember when I think of one, didn't one day I like look right

831
03:20:35,540 --> 03:20:43,260
in the camera and go like, like, Hey, Hey, Michael Anderson, what's going on, man? I used to do that

832
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:52,540
a lot, didn't I? And also it's just like, what the fuck? Oh, like how did he, what is he talking

833
03:20:52,540 --> 03:21:25,930
about? Like, Hey, Dave Smith. Oh, I can cut a pine tree. Okay. These are chunky. I thought I

834
03:21:25,930 --> 03:21:48,540
couldn't cut these. Okay. I'm just going to load the truck. All right. That should be good. Let's

835
03:21:48,540 --> 03:21:55,540
load the truck up and then I'm going to sleep and then we're going to turn this in all chat

836
03:21:55,540 --> 03:22:20,219
individually. Yeah. Oh, well I can deliver pizza, right? Or something. Okay. Let's park it right

837
03:22:20,219 --> 03:22:39,899
here. Oh, I'm going to get dark. I got to hurry up. Hopefully I have enough gas to cut this.

838
03:22:39,899 --> 03:23:02,540
This is less efficient, but then just wait. I just got to get it over here. So what is the next thing

839
03:23:02,540 --> 03:23:09,100
that I actually really do need? Like no messing around. Like, what do I need actually? I need

840
03:23:09,180 --> 03:23:23,770
something, right? Sugar shack. How do I build a sugar shack? These are massive. These logs are

841
03:23:23,770 --> 03:23:39,739
so much bigger than I thought they were. Shit. It's going to be difficult. Um, okay. I'll go get

842
03:23:39,739 --> 03:23:58,420
these. I wish I could sprint. Do pizza stuff. Hold on. Did you cut down a rubber tree? I don't

843
03:23:58,420 --> 03:24:32,569
think so. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everything's fine. All right. Let's see if these,

844
03:24:32,569 --> 03:24:39,139
if I cut this up, if it, if it fits, hopefully this gas, please tell me this gas. Come on.

845
03:24:39,139 --> 03:24:53,430
How come this is so spooky? Um, I think it's just a flashlight outside in a game. I think it's just

846
03:24:53,430 --> 03:25:11,959
at night is scary. So a sugar shack will do it. I'm almost time for me to sleep.

847
03:25:13,829 --> 03:25:30,709
Spider-man is going to get you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

848
03:25:30,709 --> 03:25:36,940
hey, what, what, what, what, what? Hey, hey, who's doing this? Who has my car? What the fuck? What

849
03:25:36,940 --> 03:25:54,489
the fuck? Who's driving my car? I put the brake on, didn't I? Oh shit. Brake is on, isn't it?

850
03:25:55,129 --> 03:26:11,190
I could have sworn the parking brake was on. I, it's on. What? Hey, I actually thought you guys

851
03:26:11,190 --> 03:26:38,420
weren't kidding around. Out of gas. How do I turn the lights off? I don't want the battery to run

852
03:26:38,420 --> 03:26:53,110
out. Turn the lights off. How the fuck is this thing out of gas? I might be in trouble here.

853
03:26:53,110 --> 03:27:07,430
I was here two hours ago doing, doing the same exact thing, but somebody just asked for it.

854
03:27:08,069 --> 03:27:13,940
So they were asking, how's my TikTok voice? And I'll tell you, it's really doing pretty well.

855
03:27:14,020 --> 03:27:17,909
Although I'm trying hard not to make it sound like that. So it's still there,

856
03:27:18,629 --> 03:27:21,819
but it's not as bad. I think it's a seasonal thing.

857
03:27:23,260 --> 03:27:28,329
Now I started talking like that and now it's there. This is empty, huh?

858
03:27:29,370 --> 03:27:45,030
Fuck. Um, this is bad. This thing has a full tank, but I can't drive it. Can I, can I just drive off

859
03:27:45,030 --> 03:27:56,170
this thing? It's got a ton of gas. See if I can get to town. Call Martin. Oh my God, you're right.

860
03:27:56,729 --> 03:28:55,719
High five five. It's what? 8 a.m.? Martin's on a reverse schedule. He's at the local diner right

861
03:28:55,719 --> 03:29:15,180
now. The first person there. No, he wouldn't be actually. 7 a.m.? Old people central. He's

862
03:29:15,180 --> 03:29:51,700
still sleeping. How are the potatoes? 44%. Hell yeah. This is kind of cool too. I haven't even

863
03:29:51,700 --> 03:30:24,180
used this. Ooh, really? How much should I do this? This'll work, right? No energy first thing in the

864
03:30:24,180 --> 03:30:46,389
morning. I have that. No, the meters are backwards. I don't want to use that. I have two eggs. Let's

865
03:30:46,389 --> 03:30:52,860
save the game here. Oh my God. No electricity. All right, Martin, will you get up? Wake up, please.

866
03:30:52,860 --> 03:31:02,680
What time? It's 8 30. I'm stranded here. I don't have any gas in my car and I need to ride to town.

867
03:31:02,680 --> 03:31:42,840
How long? When does Martin get up? I have to save. It's 4 p.m. Right before he streams. That's so bad.

868
03:31:43,319 --> 03:31:53,340
Okay, I will tell you that moving to the west coast was really, really good for me because instead

869
03:31:53,340 --> 03:32:00,440
of starting streams at like 7 p.m., 7 to 8 p.m. my local time, I couldn't really do that anymore.

870
03:32:02,389 --> 03:32:09,290
That was just not going to be really efficient at all because being three hours behind eastern time,

871
03:32:11,459 --> 03:32:18,069
I couldn't start my streams at 7 p.m. local time. There's no way. I just wouldn't be able to do that.

872
03:32:18,069 --> 03:32:23,110
That would be so late for everybody. And even starting at like four, like three, four-ish,

873
03:32:24,120 --> 03:32:28,440
is still really late for people. That's still 7 p.m. eastern, but it's 4 p.m. local.

874
03:32:29,239 --> 03:32:32,760
So it actually, I've been on like a better schedule since I've moved.

875
03:32:33,319 --> 03:32:43,290
So moving across the whole country made me get up better. It's crazy. All right, turn the generator

876
03:32:43,290 --> 03:32:49,260
off. I'm calling this guy again. It was just enough to save the game, thank God. All right,

877
03:32:49,739 --> 03:33:13,129
it's like noon. Hang up. Yeah, dude, I'm on my way to pick you up. All right,

878
03:33:13,129 --> 03:33:44,139
I need the gas can. Where is it? Is he actually coming or is he, is it not real?

879
03:33:44,940 --> 03:34:01,690
Taking like an hour or something? Will he drive me back? I don't have to walk back, right?

880
03:34:11,020 --> 03:34:34,180
He crashed. That's like not, right? Click the jack stands. What? How did I not know that?

881
03:34:34,180 --> 03:34:52,870
What's up, man? Hey, what's up, man? Cars running just fine. Turns out I don't actually need you.

882
03:34:55,350 --> 03:35:10,950
Thanks, dude. Appreciate it. You got a cool tire in there. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's mine.

883
03:35:11,510 --> 03:35:48,819
That's mine. What the fuck? No, where's the, why do I, who puts a parking brake on right here?

884
03:35:48,819 --> 03:36:07,719
Close the parking brake? Why is the parking, where's the parking brake on this car?

885
03:36:07,719 --> 03:36:19,989
Damn it. How do I get a gas can back? What do I, do I have to, I have to call him back?

886
03:36:19,989 --> 03:36:46,819
Don't even tell me that, seriously. Martin's already on the road. I have to go fucking hunt

887
03:36:46,819 --> 03:37:15,899
him down. You gotta be shitting me. How do I get out of, he went this way. I don't know where,

888
03:37:15,899 --> 03:37:38,500
I don't know where he went. He's in town. Go to the town. Oh, the lost items guy. That's right.

889
03:37:38,500 --> 03:37:47,270
Okay. Where's the lost items guy? What a pain in the ass. I gotta go the other way then.

890
03:37:47,270 --> 03:37:55,819
This is the wrong way. Is there a faster way to shift? Cause it's not one, two, three, four,

891
03:37:55,819 --> 03:38:06,040
five anymore. How do I shift? I don't, I don't want to like look down here. Oh my God. This is

892
03:38:06,040 --> 03:38:15,639
such a pain in the ass. What the hell? Um, I'm just going to go to town. How am I going to get gas?

893
03:38:19,850 --> 03:38:27,540
I'm talking about to go to reverse, not like gear shift. I don't know how I'm going to,

894
03:38:27,540 --> 03:38:31,620
I gotta go talk to the guy. Whatever. Let's go to town. I could restart the save.

895
03:38:35,510 --> 03:38:44,299
I think I'm just going to restart the save. Yeah. Fuck this. That was like, yeah, that was like

896
03:38:44,299 --> 03:39:00,920
five minutes ago. Okay. Same thing applies here. This time I'm actually going to get in the car,

897
03:39:00,920 --> 03:39:04,200
which is so, I don't know what happened. He just, I maybe got annoyed that I wasn't there.

898
03:39:04,840 --> 03:39:27,750
Okay. He's on his way. I hear something's running. All right. Okay. All right. Gas can pick it up.

899
03:39:27,750 --> 03:39:33,340
In the meantime, I actually can do this because it's going to take a minute to get here stuff.

900
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:40,299
That's cut up. Just put it in the trunk because I know I'm going to use it. I might as well just

901
03:39:40,299 --> 03:40:03,670
get this out of the way. Is this cut? No, I don't think so. It does not look cut. Are you

902
03:40:03,670 --> 03:40:09,700
torturing yourself with this game? No, I'm, if I wasn't enjoying it, at least it's fun to play

903
03:40:09,700 --> 03:40:14,180
just to fuck around. I would not be playing it if I didn't enjoy it at least enough to play it.

904
03:40:14,180 --> 03:40:39,340
So don't worry. I'm having fun. Rewater the plants. That's a good call. Yep. I don't know

905
03:40:39,340 --> 03:41:04,100
where the fuck it went. I got to go. What's up? Let's go. You are adorable today, Jason.

906
03:41:27,899 --> 03:41:58,309
Let's go. Oh, wait. He actually, what? What the fuck? I'm not drinking or smelling the gas.

907
03:41:59,290 --> 03:42:04,489
I'm just holding it over here. Oh my God. Damn it. I'm not driving with Martin anymore.

908
03:42:05,290 --> 03:42:19,850
I'm not, I'm not getting in the car with Martin. So how do I get back?

909
03:42:20,409 --> 03:42:48,659
How am I supposed to get back to my house? Bro, where are you going? Martin? Martin? Hey,

910
03:42:48,659 --> 03:43:20,700
are you going to wait here? Thanks, Martin. Wait, did we just lock ourselves out of here?

911
03:43:26,440 --> 03:43:48,819
Please remember where this is because I don't. Right near the big Christmas tree. Where's the,

912
03:43:48,819 --> 03:44:00,299
what do I do? Go in his house. That's Martin's house? Okay. That's Martin's house right there.

913
03:44:00,299 --> 03:44:22,569
I got to try to burn that into memory somehow. It's like to the right of the church. Okay. So

914
03:44:22,569 --> 03:44:28,629
from the church's front entrance, it's like to the right and straight. All right, guys. So

915
03:44:29,590 --> 03:44:46,790
how am I doing? Can I actually get back to the house from here? This is Snack Shack.

916
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:55,180
I think the gas station is over here. I look like such a fucking weirdo. I'm just walking

917
03:44:55,180 --> 03:45:09,319
around the streets holding a gas canister. What am I doing with this over there? Person? Okay.

918
03:45:10,340 --> 03:45:32,309
I only have $26. I got to be careful. All right, let's do it. I just need to gas. I can fill this

919
03:45:32,309 --> 03:45:48,180
whole tank here and then I can bring the, I can fill the truck. Okay. So I got to go find Martin.

920
03:45:48,180 --> 03:45:59,450
Okay. So this, I got what I needed. The church is over here and it's over this way. Okay. All right.

921
03:45:59,450 --> 03:46:25,159
Let's go. How do you get your maple syrup bar to go down? You have to drink maple syrup. So Martin's

922
03:46:25,159 --> 03:46:32,840
house is over here. Okay. As long as I can have landmarks burnt in, I'll be able to know where I

923
03:46:32,840 --> 03:46:47,879
am. Okay. Cool. That's what I wanted for free. So is he in the house? It was a look behind the

924
03:46:47,879 --> 03:47:16,329
house. Wood spoiler. Why would you want, I don't, a wood spoiler? This is a shelf. All right, dude,

925
03:47:16,329 --> 03:48:05,459
let's go. I don't know what you mean by this, but I somehow get it somehow. Somebody said this is

926
03:48:05,459 --> 03:48:13,139
like when I bring my TV to my friend's house. What do you, you mean like you're holding a fucking big

927
03:48:13,139 --> 03:48:23,299
ass TV? What do you mean? Like you sit there with it on your lap, bringing a big TV to my friend's

928
03:48:23,299 --> 03:48:49,739
house. Well, so you guys can play like smash brothers at like zero milliseconds. All right.

929
03:48:49,739 --> 03:48:56,549
Thanks a lot, man. Give me out, give me out this fucking car right now. Give me the fuck out of

930
03:48:56,549 --> 03:49:16,069
this car. Get me out of this car and give me my shelf. All right, let's go. We're good. That looks

931
03:49:16,069 --> 03:49:27,829
great. I promise that one day I will drive this car. I can spray paint it. I can spray paint it.

932
03:49:27,829 --> 03:49:34,200
All right. Yeah. All right. We're going all night. I'm fucking, I'm ready. I'm into this now.

933
03:49:49,500 --> 03:50:11,879
No, dude, we got to play in my CRT TV. Otherwise I can't do my chic 50 hit combo. I'm going to

934
03:50:11,879 --> 03:50:19,129
chop up so much more wood. You have no idea. Yeah. You guys don't even have any idea how much more

935
03:50:19,129 --> 03:50:25,209
wood is going to get chopped in this thing. Get ready to snooze. I'll be ready to go to sleep.

936
03:50:26,069 --> 03:50:48,700
This is not going to be an exciting one. We'll get to the truck. Oh yeah. What happened here?

937
03:50:48,700 --> 03:51:03,750
Oh, when it backed up. Right, right, right. Okay. That's a lot. Um, this is going to make me some

938
03:51:03,750 --> 03:51:09,129
money. I'm going to bring, this is probably stupid what I'm doing. I'm going to bring the truck and

939
03:51:09,129 --> 03:51:16,139
the chainsaw and the cutting machine to that guy's house. And then we're going to just cut a shit

940
03:51:16,139 --> 03:51:20,700
little wood. I'm going to make like a thousand dollars. I'm going to put a $1,000 engine in that

941
03:51:20,700 --> 03:51:47,129
car and beautiful. Let's just take what I have now. I fill it with gas. You can't cut the trees

942
03:51:47,129 --> 03:51:57,239
around his place. Oh shit. Well, nevermind. Don't use the whole thing. Don't dump it either. All

943
03:51:57,239 --> 03:52:06,090
right. What's the, how much is in here? I need enough for this. How much is in the actual tank

944
03:52:06,090 --> 03:52:16,680
here now? All right. That's good. That's good. There's plenty of gas now in this car. It was

945
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:21,559
moving. The car was moving. The car was moving. Did you see the car move? I did. The parking

946
03:52:21,559 --> 03:52:30,629
brake is on. Why is it moving like this? Why is it moving? I have the parking brake on. What?

947
03:52:38,229 --> 03:53:17,959
It's too up. It's what? Dude, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

948
03:53:25,850 --> 03:53:49,979
Can I suck it out of here? Can I suck it out? Wait, excuse me. I thought there was no nothing

949
03:53:49,979 --> 03:54:09,260
left in there. What? I thought there was nothing left. What is going on here? I want to tell me

950
03:54:09,260 --> 03:54:39,020
how much is left in the tank. What happened? Why is the HUD turned off? Okay. Very good. I'm very

951
03:54:39,020 --> 03:54:50,489
happy about this. Let's close that up. Let's cut some more wood. I'm ready. I have a bunch of logs

952
03:54:50,489 --> 03:55:01,979
here. I don't think I can fit very much more than this. So he's happy. I'm very happy. I'm doing

953
03:55:01,979 --> 03:55:11,879
great. Hopefully you're doing great too. I hope so. Smoke on stream. I'm not going to smoke. It's

954
03:55:11,879 --> 03:55:18,120
not even 420 anymore in England. So whatever. What's wrong? Oh, I need to drink maple syrup.

955
03:55:18,120 --> 03:55:43,209
I'm going to die. Go. I might only be able to do one more little batch of this. Can we,

956
03:55:43,209 --> 03:55:57,739
Jerma, can we do a race before the five hour mark? What do you mean? I don't know what that means.

957
03:55:59,459 --> 03:56:05,780
I've raced in the game, right? There's races. Yeah. My car's a piece of shit. How am I supposed

958
03:56:05,780 --> 03:56:12,979
to do that? That car is, where's my car? Okay. Look, do you think I'm going to race with that?

959
03:56:12,979 --> 03:56:29,180
Okay. Let's put this, I think that's all I can do. Maybe, maybe one more, but that's going to be it.

960
03:56:29,180 --> 03:56:42,629
I think I don't think I can do much more than that. Maybe one more. What was it? Like 300 bucks?

961
03:56:43,350 --> 03:56:55,450
Do the racing. I guys, the game, the map is in French and I don't even know where to go.

962
03:56:55,770 --> 03:57:14,139
What do you want me to say? Well, I'll go do a race. Oh, I'm not mad. I'm fine.

963
03:57:22,889 --> 03:57:30,680
I think I can get one more tree in here as long as I'm very safe about it. Dr. Thunder is good.

964
03:57:30,680 --> 03:57:39,260
I have not had Dr. Thunder in a very long time. I think one more tree can fit in here and I'll

965
03:57:39,260 --> 03:57:46,409
just drive over the thing. Nah, fuck it. I want money now. Let's go. I'll cut this last one.

966
03:57:46,969 --> 03:58:21,979
That's enough. Can I turn this in at night or not? Any of you lore masters in here? All right. Good

967
03:58:21,979 --> 03:58:49,290
night. Save the game. He's faking it. He knows how to speak French. Check out episode four of his

968
03:58:49,290 --> 03:59:13,219
TF2 series with Sir He Literally Fluently Speaks French. Okay. I showed my sister one of your old

969
03:59:13,219 --> 03:59:19,290
VODs and she said, she said he's good with it. What does that mean? I don't know. I have absolutely

970
03:59:19,290 --> 03:59:38,840
no idea what that means. Okay. Now turn off the generator. How do I turn the lights off in the

971
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:51,239
car? I can't. Lights. Like I can't turn it off. It's right mouse bumper. All right. Tomorrow is

972
03:59:51,239 --> 04:00:04,809
when I make the money and then I can finally drive that dumb ass car off the lot. I can finally get

973
04:00:04,809 --> 04:00:22,420
that dumb ass car out of here. It's 5 30 in the morning. Plenty of time to eat something,

974
04:00:23,219 --> 04:00:33,379
drink some syrup. My reserves are kind of going low though. Every night at the abandoned grocery

975
04:00:33,379 --> 04:00:44,950
store. Car meat. Okay. We'll do that tomorrow night. I got to get this thing nice and souped up.

976
04:00:48,100 --> 04:00:52,659
I need to rust repair kit, some more blue paint. So I need how many? I have one, two,

977
04:00:53,459 --> 04:01:04,649
three, one, two, three, or five. I need like five or six rust repair kits and I need blue,

978
04:01:04,649 --> 04:01:11,750
that light, I need like two cans of that light blue paint. So the spoiler be, I'm going to make

979
04:01:11,750 --> 04:01:35,940
the spoiler clean. Okay. Sounds good. I need money though. So let's go. I swear to God,

980
04:01:35,940 --> 04:02:00,920
I'm going to do that every fucking time. All right. So let me think here. All right. I,

981
04:02:13,639 --> 04:02:23,540
one more tree. I want like three or $400. One more. I promise. Just whatever's right here.

982
04:02:23,540 --> 04:02:50,360
You can't drive for shit. I'm using W. See me in with real car. Okay. Don't drive a real car with

983
04:02:50,360 --> 04:02:57,459
WASD. I know that like they did it in a James Bond movie, but that's not how it works. He sat

984
04:02:57,459 --> 04:03:08,250
down with his fucking Nintendo DS and drove the car around. True. Sure. All right. That's enough.

985
04:03:08,250 --> 04:03:27,350
Fill it up. Cause it looks like there's a lot of room at the back of the yeah, right here.

986
04:03:27,350 --> 04:03:35,979
There's tons of room. Can you parallel park? No, but you don't need to parallel park to be like

987
04:03:35,979 --> 04:03:46,100
a good driver. I could, I could probably do it pretty well. I just don't really need to

988
04:03:48,979 --> 04:04:01,209
parallel park these. I'm not going to say the rest of it, but a good one. That's copious.

989
04:04:01,209 --> 04:04:10,229
What's with the copium comments today? That's not copium. I can't remember the last time that I

990
04:04:10,229 --> 04:04:16,940
needed to parallel park. I just can't think of the last time I really had to do it where it was like,

991
04:04:16,940 --> 04:04:27,819
Oh shit, I have to parallel park. All right. That's good. No more. I'm going to take this

992
04:04:27,819 --> 04:04:41,159
came with me because I'm going to keep going to town and I'll fill it up. Wait, I can't do either

993
04:04:43,020 --> 04:04:51,930
driving is stressful. It really is. If you driving can be pretty stressful. So no, I don't,

994
04:04:51,930 --> 04:04:58,260
I wouldn't worry about that. Especially driving a big city or something. No,

995
04:04:58,260 --> 04:05:14,700
no, don't let anybody tell you. It's not the one thing I will say that. I mean like Las Vegas is

996
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:24,729
seriously goaded Las Vegas. It's highway system is just a square. Is it? It's just a

997
04:05:25,209 --> 04:05:30,629
it is so easy to drive in Las Vegas. It's unbelievable.

998
04:05:31,190 --> 04:05:37,000
Driving around Boston was something I, I hated doing because it was, it was just,

999
04:05:37,000 --> 04:05:47,590
it was terrifying. All the roads are like four inches wide in Vegas. Like there's so many

1000
04:05:47,590 --> 04:05:55,219
turning lanes. It's tons of like rotaries and it's just so much better. So much better.

1001
04:05:57,299 --> 04:06:00,819
I think Vegas is one of the best cities to drive in. It's one of the easiest to drive in,

1002
04:06:00,819 --> 04:06:07,540
in the country. I think now the drivers in Vegas, that's a little different story.

1003
04:06:08,549 --> 04:06:17,190
The roads are great. The drivers on the other hand would be way fucking better. It's actually

1004
04:06:17,190 --> 04:06:25,590
insane. How bad the drivers in Vegas actually are, which is crazy because I'm sitting there

1005
04:06:25,590 --> 04:06:29,750
going like, man, we have this huge, amazing, like it's everything's so easy to navigate.

1006
04:06:30,469 --> 04:06:45,670
Why are people driving around like fucking psychos? They're like you. No, I, no way, man.

1007
04:06:50,649 --> 04:06:56,170
I'm the person that in the car, when some crazy driver like blows by,

1008
04:06:58,170 --> 04:07:03,930
I'm the one that's going like, I'm going like 65 and I'm just like, my goodness, my goodness,

1009
04:07:05,020 --> 04:07:15,479
but be you be careful. That's me. That's what I do. I just shake my head. I'm just like,

1010
04:07:16,280 --> 04:07:19,879
unbelievable. I'm, you're going to fucking hurt someone. That's what I do.

1011
04:07:20,600 --> 04:07:46,819
Come on. 400 bucks. You've seen this. Hey, $400. You've seen this. All right. Let's keep going to

1012
04:07:46,819 --> 04:08:01,270
town and I'm going to keep going. All right. I got to go back, right? Because hold on. No,

1013
04:08:01,270 --> 04:08:15,979
no, no, just keep going this way. Don't lose the chainsaw. I won't. Yeah. I'm the person that

1014
04:08:16,540 --> 04:08:21,020
gasps when somebody drives by going like crazy. And look, I get like, oh,

1015
04:08:22,709 --> 04:08:29,190
60. You're just going to go 60, 65, 60, 60, 60 Andy. Don't be a fucking idiot in a car. Seriously.

1016
04:08:29,989 --> 04:08:37,510
Don't drive that fast. There's no reason to go like five to 10 miles per hour over the speed

1017
04:08:37,510 --> 04:08:41,030
limit. Like there really just kind of isn't like, just fucking be careful. Seriously guys,

1018
04:08:41,030 --> 04:08:59,500
don't be stupid. Like if you're on a road that's like 60, 65 and you're like, I'm going to go 90,

1019
04:09:00,139 --> 04:09:35,639
man, come on, just fucking chill. My car won't do 90. 90 is not five to, I'm just saying what is

1020
04:09:35,639 --> 04:09:48,979
this? Whoa. What's this? What's going on here? I already have a spoiler, but that's kind of cool.

1021
04:09:48,979 --> 04:10:08,860
Wheel spacer shifter. Hey, what's up Roger? What do you got in here? Ooh, metallic. I want that.

1022
04:10:08,860 --> 04:10:27,530
He's a hoods. Okay. Do I, can I afford any of these nitrous bottle blue bolts? These are way

1023
04:10:27,530 --> 04:10:34,139
too expensive. I can't afford any of these better trunk. I can't afford any of this. I need to just

1024
04:10:34,139 --> 04:11:05,579
do the basic shit first. Well, thanks for the metallic spray paint. I'm kidding. Relax. All

1025
04:11:05,579 --> 04:11:10,379
right. So now I just got to go to the gas station and get some more gas, get some more spray paint

1026
04:11:10,379 --> 04:11:21,899
and some more repair kits. It doesn't have to look good. It can look bad and go fast. Yeah.

1027
04:11:21,899 --> 04:11:29,770
That's true. But all right. Where's this guy? I always like, yeah, it's right there next to the

1028
04:11:29,770 --> 04:11:49,370
truck. Let me fill all this shit. I have plenty of money. So are these, are these both these the same?

1029
04:11:49,370 --> 04:12:14,729
Say Aaron, please. Aaron. He's the same thing, right? Yeah. That for the car that's on my lot.

1030
04:12:14,729 --> 04:12:20,120
We'll have a full tank. I wish I could, I buy another gas can somewhere. I feel like I need to.

1031
04:12:20,760 --> 04:12:28,360
All right. Hello. I'm here. I'm here to get a rust repair kit.

1032
04:12:28,360 --> 04:12:51,930
Oh, I need like four of these. This car is so beat up. 240 bucks. I could, should I get shocks?

1033
04:12:51,930 --> 04:13:15,350
Two of them? Can I afford to get these and put them in? Don't do it yet. Okay. I can't afford

1034
04:13:15,350 --> 04:13:32,629
these. Ooh, tires. Window tint. Oh yeah. Let's do, um, I don't know. What should I do? Green?

1035
04:13:33,190 --> 04:13:48,889
I need another repair kit, right? It doesn't have any left. Window film remover? Pruning?

1036
04:13:49,530 --> 04:14:30,549
Pruning loppers? What's a pruning lopper? What should I do? Get the under glow kit. All right.

1037
04:14:30,549 --> 04:14:38,540
I'm done. I bought all their, uh, repair kits. Let me see what I got. I have two repair kits,

1038
04:14:39,340 --> 04:14:56,520
green tint, the paint, gas. Let me fill the tank here. I don't have to worry about this. Do I need

1039
04:14:56,520 --> 04:15:11,860
to buy the loppers? Go to the maple syrup center. I will once I can actually drive this car

1040
04:15:11,860 --> 04:15:25,000
because it's so much better than the truck. Should I actually buy these loppers? I'm going

1041
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:28,440
to buy them because if I'm, I don't know, I'm probably going to need them for some random

1042
04:15:28,440 --> 04:15:43,430
stupid thing. Do it now. Where's the maple syrup center? Is it one that says hmm? All right. So

1043
04:15:43,430 --> 04:16:01,780
where am I right now? I don't know how to get that from here. So how do I get that from here?

1044
04:16:06,020 --> 04:16:28,420
Right? Or it's right on the edge of town. Drop it off at your shit house. Jesus. This is it right

1045
04:16:28,420 --> 04:16:48,579
here then. Yeah. Federation syrup de-edible. Barrel. Place barrel of syrup here to sell.

1046
04:16:48,579 --> 04:16:58,840
Sap. Ooh. Hand sealer? Wait. Okay. Do I need to buy a bunch of this stuff? Okay. Sap spouts.

1047
04:16:58,840 --> 04:17:09,899
Okay. I'm going to get some of these. Should I buy more than one? Tubing roll? I'm just going

1048
04:17:09,899 --> 04:17:19,379
to get everything. I have 50 bucks. I probably should be careful. Tubing post? I need cans too.

1049
04:17:20,020 --> 04:17:44,100
Can crate? I'm going to run out of money. And then cans. How many cans should I get? A few? I don't

1050
04:17:44,100 --> 04:17:52,069
have enough for a post. I don't have enough money. Okay. I don't want to run out of money. So I'll

1051
04:17:52,069 --> 04:17:59,530
just take those. I'll just get this started. Kind of. I got to fix the car up still. So let's go.

1052
04:17:59,530 --> 04:18:14,920
I'm okay. I'm not going this way. This is going to take me forever to get home. Turn around. I need

1053
04:18:14,920 --> 04:18:23,739
lids for the cans. You don't have a canner or a barrel. Well, I'll get this later. All right. So

1054
04:18:23,739 --> 04:18:34,969
now I'm just going to drive straight and then take a right. Let's go. Grow weed. I've got potatoes

1055
04:18:34,969 --> 04:19:01,260
growing. Okay. What is that? Is that free? My God. It's a thousand. Okay. That's way too much.

1056
04:19:01,260 --> 04:19:26,059
Decorations. You're going to think for five dollars. I guess not. A wheelbarrow. All right.

1057
04:19:26,139 --> 04:19:55,799
Whatever. Let's go. Out of my way. All right. So now it's straight, right? No. Where am I going?

1058
04:19:55,799 --> 04:20:23,049
This way? Oh, rear end that guy. I got the map now. I got it. I have no idea what he's doing,

1059
04:20:23,049 --> 04:20:33,510
but I can't look away. I have all my shit here still, right? Yeah. Okay. We're good.

1060
04:20:33,510 --> 04:20:51,159
And then at night tonight, I'm going to go take my car. Fucking be an idiot. Turn the radio on.

1061
04:20:56,459 --> 04:21:57,340
There's nothing on radio. It's DMCA. This is one log in the road. All right. Let's go. Repair kit.

1062
04:21:57,819 --> 04:22:04,260
Repair kit again. This is starting to look like a nice car now. All right. What should I do it to?

1063
04:22:04,260 --> 04:22:34,219
One of the tires? Yeah. I'm going to do to one of the tires. Hell yeah. Where's my nice. Very cool.

1064
04:22:34,219 --> 04:22:48,920
All right. Hell yeah. Now I want the spoiler. Look at that. It's looking good. Looking much better.

1065
04:22:48,920 --> 04:23:26,729
Are you serious? Can I not paint the spoiler? How do I use this under glow kit? How do I use it?

1066
04:23:26,729 --> 04:23:51,540
How do I put that on? Put it under the hood. This is a remover, right? Crouching and lift up the car.

1067
04:23:51,540 --> 04:24:10,780
I don't have, how do I, I don't have a jack. I don't like have a jack, right? I mean, I can't

1068
04:24:10,780 --> 04:24:24,620
really. Where's my, where is it? If I have it, where is it? Is it for the interior? Oh, yep. It is.

1069
04:24:24,620 --> 04:25:07,659
Okay. It's for the interior. Whoa. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It's, it's a fucking stick of Ram. Okay. All

1070
04:25:07,659 --> 04:25:12,280
right. All right. All right. All right. We're ready. I'm ready to, I think I'm ready to race

1071
04:25:12,280 --> 04:25:27,319
this thing tonight, right? Good friendship with Francis. Complete the garage. Gain access to the

1072
04:25:27,319 --> 04:25:39,899
scrap yard. Install a manual transmission. I'm not doing that. Okay. So let's go race. How do I,

1073
04:25:39,899 --> 04:25:50,500
I get it. I can take this off. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. What happened? That ear was itchy. I'm so

1074
04:25:50,500 --> 04:26:06,809
sorry. This thing's ready to rock and roll. What time is it? It's okay. Let me, um, I have energy.

1075
04:26:06,809 --> 04:26:17,350
Let me check it out. Why does the spoiler keep falling off? Do I have to screw it on? Oh, green

1076
04:26:17,350 --> 04:26:32,920
tint. That's right. Holy shit. You're right. How could I forget? Wait, am I gonna, am I gonna be

1077
04:26:33,000 --> 04:27:04,469
supposed to put it on? The tires are deflated. No, they're not night vision. Oh yeah. The tires

1078
04:27:04,469 --> 04:27:15,079
are not deflated. They're fine. What the fuck happened? This tire, something wrong with this

1079
04:27:15,079 --> 04:27:52,620
tire. Dude, what the fuck? How do I keep it on there to tape it? This is my wrench. I don't,

1080
04:27:52,620 --> 04:28:06,309
I have no idea what the wrench is. So whatever. All right. It's time. It is almost six o'clock.

1081
04:28:06,309 --> 04:28:21,750
Almost make sure I have gas to do this shit. I want a full tank of gas. I can finally drive

1082
04:28:21,750 --> 04:28:43,239
this thing. I don't want to use the whole thing because I need this over here. Someone here,

1083
04:28:52,309 --> 04:29:13,690
someone here. All right. Save your game. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

1084
04:29:13,690 --> 04:29:21,799
Save it and then it'll be really late at night and I can go do the race. How old are you?

1085
04:29:23,239 --> 04:29:55,639
I turned 19 a week ago. I was graduation. Are you 19 in dog years?

1086
04:29:59,260 --> 04:30:13,370
You look younger than ever. Moisturize. If anybody asked me for any actual advice,

1087
04:30:13,370 --> 04:30:20,100
the advice is actually moisturize your face. That's the only, that's the advice I'm going

1088
04:30:20,100 --> 04:31:01,739
to give you for anything. Wait, I can boost the seat up? How do I turn the fucking lights on?

1089
04:31:13,260 --> 04:31:45,930
Oh, look at this car. I need the radio. This car doesn't have a radio. What do you mean?

1090
04:31:45,930 --> 04:31:57,930
Doesn't have no way. There's no radio. All right. Into town and I'm going to do,

1091
04:31:58,649 --> 04:32:31,639
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going somewhere in town. What? The spoiler came off.

1092
04:32:31,639 --> 04:33:01,819
It is. It's so dark. It's so dark. I can't see anything. Did I go the wrong way? I feel like

1093
04:33:01,819 --> 04:33:24,229
I went the wrong way. No, I didn't. It's right here. Can you play this game in third person

1094
04:33:24,229 --> 04:33:41,590
does it have to be a first person? Oh shit. Okay. I got it. Hey yo, what's up? What's up?

1095
04:33:41,590 --> 04:34:09,029
What's up, fellas? All right. All right. What do you think? What's up, dude? What's up, bro?

1096
04:34:09,029 --> 04:34:12,310
Yo man, even though it's kind of cold tonight, it's nothing compared to how I stoned I am.

1097
04:34:12,310 --> 04:34:20,459
You have some for that. You have some for that. You have some for sell. Don't bring him in that.

1098
04:34:22,439 --> 04:34:31,270
I would probably wait. I would like to race. Good to see you. So boring racing here in almost straight

1099
04:34:31,270 --> 04:34:43,290
line. I like tore up the road. You look good today. My twin cam engine is so fast. Imagine

1100
04:34:43,290 --> 04:34:54,150
when I turned it more. How's everything? You look good today. Thank you. Pretty cool. Are we ready

1101
04:34:54,150 --> 04:35:06,779
to go race to the sawmill? I don't know where any of this stuff is. I don't, I don't have $50.

1102
04:35:30,630 --> 04:35:38,860
I'll see you in two days, man. By the way, call the fucking Kellogg's box. You got that

1103
04:35:38,860 --> 04:36:15,979
fucking piece of shit out of good one. Easy run. It's just going to chase me. Oh shit. I need to

1104
04:36:15,979 --> 04:36:36,790
eat something. Where am I? What's the point of that if I'm just wasting gas? There's no point.

1105
04:36:36,790 --> 04:36:50,069
I just literally used a half a tank of gas for no reason. I need $50. So you know what we're doing.

1106
04:36:52,860 --> 04:37:05,400
Wood cutting stream. How is it? I need to go to sleep. Burn this off. I don't want to waste the

1107
04:37:05,400 --> 04:37:27,479
gas. This dude's going to end up at level 99 wood cutting. You got to sell weed. Go climb the

1108
04:37:27,479 --> 04:37:33,099
wind turbines and you'll get weed seeds. I might buy potatoes over here too. I need to check on

1109
04:37:33,099 --> 04:37:49,080
them. How are they doing? Getting there. 88%. Probably tomorrow. All right. Here we go. I'm

1110
04:37:49,080 --> 04:37:53,319
taking my truck down here and I'm going to fill it. I'm going to try to get like five or six hundred

1111
04:37:53,319 --> 04:38:18,250
bucks. Chainsaw's in there. Let's get this stuff out. Everything's empty. Good. Chainsaw in there.

1112
04:38:18,889 --> 04:38:30,470
Okay. Time to cut some wood. Everybody's favorite part of the stream. Weed is a crop that's been

1113
04:38:30,470 --> 04:38:40,900
grown and harvested. You don't need to copy and paste the entire paragraph to get me to

1114
04:38:40,900 --> 04:39:01,860
do the weed thing. Let's move. Okay. Fill the car. Wood right here should be fine.

1115
04:39:02,740 --> 04:39:09,450
Parking brake. I'm going to keep the lights on because I think it illuminates the area a little

1116
04:39:09,450 --> 04:39:25,959
bit if I had it the right fucking way. Great. Good job. Good work. We want weed. I'll do it.

1117
04:39:25,959 --> 04:39:44,979
I'll do it tomorrow. Let me at least get some cash so I can keep playing. You can find weed at the

1118
04:39:44,979 --> 04:39:49,909
top of one of the windmills. That seems like so out of the way. Why would they? That seems like

1119
04:39:49,909 --> 04:40:31,450
really far away. Let's do two more trees. Chainsaw. Okay. Dude, what am I thinking? Am I like stupid?

1120
04:40:31,450 --> 04:40:45,290
Look at this. I can just put this shit in the car like this. It should stay in there, right?

1121
04:40:45,290 --> 04:41:09,400
I'm looking for at least a thousand bucks. This is enough. This will get me to at least 500.

1122
04:41:10,119 --> 04:42:23,430
That's fine. It's all right. I'm not going far. Quickly and efficiently. I'll grow weed. I promise

1123
04:42:23,430 --> 04:42:38,650
I'll grow weed. His cheeks are the same color as his shirt. It's because my white balance is fucked

1124
04:42:38,650 --> 04:42:58,060
up. That means I have a lot of like blood in my face which is like, you know, healthy. They call

1125
04:42:58,060 --> 04:43:15,500
it a glow, guys. Come on. That's all I got for now. Is there a... It's probably a better way to load

1126
04:43:15,500 --> 04:43:32,299
the truck, right? Whatever. A healthy 70% total blood level in your cheeks. I don't know what's

1127
04:43:32,700 --> 04:43:40,169
supposed to be healthy or whatever, but I feel okay. I feel fine. What time is it? It's not too

1128
04:43:40,169 --> 04:43:54,099
late. I can keep going. I actually probably can put another couple of trees in here. We'll see.

1129
04:44:05,110 --> 04:44:17,419
Maybe not. I'm getting hung. I'm getting... What did you just say? Do you sleep like a bat? Is that

1130
04:44:17,419 --> 04:44:30,169
why? I don't know how they do that. How do bats do that shit? It isn't hanging upside down. How

1131
04:44:30,169 --> 04:44:39,979
do they sleep upside down? Wouldn't that be just bad? How does a bat sleep upside down and have it

1132
04:44:39,979 --> 04:44:55,639
be like, okay? They evolved to do that. But what, like, mechanically, how is that functioning?

1133
04:45:01,580 --> 04:45:11,930
I can definitely put more than another tree in here. Probably two more. Oh my god, fine.

1134
04:45:24,340 --> 04:45:42,650
Okay, I'm good. I'll go get the weed. I will. Wait. These are done. 88%. These have been

1135
04:45:42,650 --> 04:45:49,659
done tomorrow. Probably have a different... I feel like if I read that, that's me saying something

1136
04:45:49,659 --> 04:45:56,709
weird. Different system in the brain? I feel like that's like a ligma, like ligma nuts or something,

1137
04:45:56,709 --> 04:46:09,139
right? What are you saying? Everybody wants to say that so I don't look like an idiot.

1138
04:46:09,139 --> 04:46:15,740
The limbic system. Yeah, but I don't know. I just was reading it for a second. I'm just like, wait,

1139
04:46:15,740 --> 04:46:35,290
is that like a ligma, like ligma balls? I don't know. You said it though. If I was just saying,

1140
04:46:35,290 --> 04:46:41,319
is it one of those? Because, I don't know, I can't trust any of you. I can't trust you guys.

1141
04:46:41,319 --> 04:46:56,520
Sometimes it's, you guys go... I don't know. Vinny just hosted. What's going on guys? Thanks Vinny.

1142
04:46:57,740 --> 04:47:04,040
Welcome, welcome, welcome. We are in the process of cutting wood and we are creating

1143
04:47:05,380 --> 04:47:14,419
an environment where I can make some money in this game. Hope you had a good stream. Thanks a lot.

1144
04:47:15,060 --> 04:47:19,509
Stick around, we're gonna be here for a little while. You caught us at a great time because

1145
04:47:19,509 --> 04:47:27,580
we're about to make about five to six hundred dollars here and then I'm gonna go do a street

1146
04:47:27,580 --> 04:47:36,299
race. So we are, it's gonna be Pog. I'm afraid that there's not enough gas to cut all this but

1147
04:47:36,299 --> 04:48:00,840
let's find out. Welcome to the cutting wood for five hours stream. I've done other stuff

1148
04:48:00,840 --> 04:48:05,720
like get lost and complain about the map for a long time. I mean that was a while.

1149
04:48:05,720 --> 04:48:23,509
Are we doing one more? One more batch? All right, that's it. Enough, enough, enough, enough. No more.

1150
04:48:23,509 --> 04:48:34,619
Take this, sell it. Go to the windmill, get the weed. From there we'll go from at the weed.

1151
04:48:34,619 --> 04:48:50,459
Potatoes will be done by then. I feel like I'm making a Thanksgiving dinner. What was Vinny doing

1152
04:48:50,459 --> 04:49:01,060
today? Anything interesting? Something cool? Waiting, one more. What's, ah come on, what's one more?

1153
04:49:01,060 --> 04:49:13,880
Kirby? Is that new Kirby game any good? Is it the new Kirby game? Should I play the new Kirby game?

1154
04:49:13,880 --> 04:49:38,389
I wish this was strawberry magic. Yeah, it's good. Interesting. Lego Star Wars 2? Yeah, there's a lot

1155
04:49:38,389 --> 04:49:46,520
of things I could play. What should I do next time? You want to do like a full-on viewer's choice

1156
04:49:46,520 --> 04:49:50,279
right now? There's like 20,000 people here. Are you ready to have, you want to go for it?

1157
04:49:50,279 --> 04:50:10,759
What do you guys want to do? I'm open to suggestions. All right, that's it. No more. Do M&M's Beach Party?

1158
04:50:10,759 --> 04:50:23,979
Ah, I played that game. It was all right. Elden Ring Part 35. Did you do Breath of the Wild?

1159
04:50:30,259 --> 04:50:44,900
Not now, not yet. I need to be really in the mood for that. Ace Attorney? I can't play Ace Attorney.

1160
04:50:44,900 --> 04:50:49,830
We, all right, let me go over this real quick for a lot of the new viewers that don't know.

1161
04:50:49,830 --> 04:50:54,970
I would, I want to play Ace Attorney. I want to play it. But Ace Attorney does this thing

1162
04:50:54,970 --> 04:51:05,369
where every minute to like two minutes, the screen goes and it's a white flash in your face.

1163
04:51:07,220 --> 04:51:17,400
It actually happens like every 15 to 30 seconds. It goes. I wish I could turn it off.

1164
04:51:21,659 --> 04:51:32,259
The next time you play Ace Attorney, just watch. It flashes the screen every 15 seconds. This is

1165
04:51:32,259 --> 04:51:44,150
a lot of wood. We're good. All right, let's go turn this in. If I could mod it out as an option to turn

1166
04:51:44,150 --> 04:51:47,990
the flash off in the newest Ace Attorney game. Yeah, the newest one, but not the old ones. Then

1167
04:51:47,990 --> 04:51:54,540
everyone wants to see the old ones played on this stream, right? I get requests all the time to play

1168
04:51:54,540 --> 04:52:27,099
Ace Attorney. Oh! I'm fine. We're good. Didn't lose one brick. Do the remade one? Switch version.

1169
04:52:27,099 --> 04:52:45,880
You can turn it off. Huh. Wear shades. Just wear sunglasses while I play. That would be so stupid,

1170
04:52:45,880 --> 04:53:06,200
but it would work. All right. Who's going to be the closest? How much am I going to get for this?

1171
04:53:06,200 --> 04:53:19,270
Or like 50 or 25. All right. I'm ready to fucking race. Can I do it? It says become friends with

1172
04:53:19,270 --> 04:53:26,169
Francis. Can I say anything to him or do anything with him? Can we hang out? I don't. We just

1173
04:53:26,169 --> 04:53:37,459
completed the second floor in the garage. So much room for activities. Okay, cool. I don't think I

1174
04:53:37,459 --> 04:53:46,360
can go in there, but sure. Okay. $125. I have gas. I'm going to go bet and I'm going to go race and

1175
04:53:46,360 --> 04:53:50,279
I'm going to go sleep and I'm going to come back. I'm going to race. Sounds fun. Let's do it.

1176
04:53:51,000 --> 04:54:43,860
This is wasting gas. Is it? It takes more gas to back up. Oh, my spoiler's back. That's actually

1177
04:54:43,860 --> 04:54:51,060
cool. Didn't I lose it? Oh, I've reloaded the game. That's right. So that means I have to do the

1178
04:54:51,060 --> 04:55:00,090
tires again then. This one especially. No. Maybe I did. Did I save it after doing that? Yeah, I did.

1179
04:55:00,090 --> 04:55:16,650
Okay. All right. I'm ready to do it. Let's go. Rest up. I'll save the game when I get up.

1180
04:55:16,650 --> 04:55:34,919
Bolt the spoiler down. How do I bolt the spoiler down? Do I have a thing to do that?

1181
04:55:34,919 --> 04:55:53,689
It doesn't look like there's a slot for it. Is there a slot for this? I don't see one. I need

1182
04:55:53,689 --> 04:56:15,450
the wrench. Okay. What do I do with the wrench? Where's the wrench? Dude, where's the wrench?

1183
04:56:15,450 --> 04:57:06,250
Thank you. Is it on there now? Do I need two? I'm ready. Turning this on. Save the game and

1184
04:57:06,250 --> 04:57:31,830
let's go race. Very cool. Almost time. Night night night, right? Night time. Stanley Parable Ultra

1185
04:57:31,830 --> 04:57:54,619
Deluxe. It'll be night time when I'm done with this. Don't yawn. We didn't decide what game.

1186
04:57:56,650 --> 04:58:01,459
I don't know. I'm down for whatever. What's something that I haven't done that you guys

1187
04:58:01,459 --> 04:58:30,220
would like to see? Do Ape Escape? How about Paper Mario? No. I've heard of that game,

1188
04:58:30,220 --> 04:58:38,580
Iron Lung. Should we do Iron Lung? That game's only like an hour and a half long though, right?

1189
04:58:40,810 --> 04:58:45,560
We'd have to do something else. All right. Well, next stream, we're going to do Iron Lung.

1190
04:58:47,349 --> 04:59:04,619
And no, I'm not stopping the stream right now. I have to win. I have to do at least race one time.

1191
04:59:04,619 --> 04:59:25,099
I've got plenty of gas, right? I can't find the lights every time. They're in such a weird

1192
04:59:25,099 --> 05:00:04,200
spot. Where are they? Right here. All right. Both? Okay. Yeah. Yes. Let's do it. B for third

1193
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:24,790
person. Holy shit. I cannot fucking believe it's taking me five hours to press B. Oh, I don't know.

1194
05:00:24,790 --> 05:01:13,880
How am I supposed to know? This is so much better. You should do a drift. Medium left. Just play

1195
05:01:13,880 --> 05:01:21,750
Baldi's Basics. No. I'll do Iron Lung and something else. We need like two or three games next time.

1196
05:01:21,750 --> 05:01:40,860
I have a list of stuff that I haven't played yet. That might be fun. I could jump out of the car.

1197
05:01:40,860 --> 05:01:54,279
All right. I'm back. Race to the sawmill. I don't know what the sawmill is and I don't know where

1198
05:01:54,279 --> 05:03:00,439
it is. So let's go. Go beside. All right. Let's go. Here we go. I'm ready. What? That's it? That's it?

1199
05:03:00,439 --> 05:03:16,119
How am I ever going to beat anybody? How am I supposed to do this? I need to cheat. All right.

1200
05:03:16,119 --> 05:03:22,500
Does somebody else have a car that I can beat? I feel like the truck is faster. The truck is

1201
05:03:22,500 --> 05:03:27,770
probably faster. I feel like it actually is faster. I don't know why I'm using this thing.

1202
05:03:27,770 --> 05:03:44,490
Let's go again. Okay. Race to the... Okay. Race to the Federation. This is just $200. All right.

1203
05:03:44,490 --> 05:04:23,540
This car didn't look as fast. How do you reverse? I don't know. Oh, come on. Jesus Christ. Actually,

1204
05:04:23,540 --> 05:04:50,459
like actually stuck. Where is everybody? Did that motherfucker take $200 from me and leave?

1205
05:04:50,459 --> 05:05:04,220
Because it's morning or something? What the fuck is going on? What? I drove off? I didn't drive off.

1206
05:05:04,220 --> 05:05:09,500
I was trying to turn around and then everybody leaves? Like the geek in the fucking wooden

1207
05:05:09,500 --> 05:05:19,909
spoiler car? You take my money and leave? All right. I'm going to the windmills. We're doing

1208
05:05:19,909 --> 05:05:51,180
the weed. Fine. Reload the save. Yeah. Sure. I'll give you $200 and I'll race you. Okay. Good.

1209
05:05:51,180 --> 05:05:56,459
Thanks, man. Okay. Let me just like turn around real quick. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. This

1210
05:05:56,459 --> 05:06:03,299
is a new car. I don't know how to reverse it. Don't leave. Why is everybody leaving? Don't leave.

1211
05:06:03,299 --> 05:06:25,419
This motherfucker tinted his windshield. We got to go. We got to get the fuck out of here.

1212
05:06:25,419 --> 05:06:46,380
Cartoon geek. Oh, you can use your blinkers. How do I turn my blinker off? I don't know.

1213
05:06:46,380 --> 05:07:09,590
Where is it? How do I turn the blinker off? All right. One, I want to let me do the $200 one.

1214
05:07:09,590 --> 05:07:20,119
That's it. I feel like that's going to be longer and there's more opportunity for them to make

1215
05:07:20,119 --> 05:07:41,900
mistake. Well, I take the more expensive track because I feel like the more expensive one is

1216
05:07:41,900 --> 05:07:50,139
longer. So I probably have a chance to take a turn or something. It's probably harder,

1217
05:07:50,139 --> 05:07:53,180
but if there are turns involved, then I might actually be able to get an advantage.

1218
05:08:00,060 --> 05:08:05,020
Whatever happens here, no matter what, I'm going to get over to the windmill

1219
05:08:06,139 --> 05:08:17,080
and climb the wind. Let's just do it now. No, I will go to the windmill and see if I can get up

1220
05:08:17,080 --> 05:08:46,139
there and get the weed. Oh shit. It's the fucking green geek again. It's the fucking green geek.

1221
05:08:46,139 --> 05:09:56,540
Don't do that. God damn it. Come on. God. Okay. We're good. It doesn't count. It doesn't count

1222
05:09:56,540 --> 05:10:04,360
because you have to touch it. Oh my God. He's blazing. I'm in the fucking dust. This is late

1223
05:10:04,360 --> 05:10:12,900
game shit. How am I ever going to do this? Look at this. Look at how much loser my grandma does

1224
05:10:12,900 --> 05:10:53,639
her shopping faster than that. No, it's in the ocean. This geek didn't, he didn't belong.

1225
05:10:53,639 --> 05:11:21,860
Oh shit. The car's smoking. I got to get out. What the fuck? All right. I obviously can't do that. So

1226
05:11:22,740 --> 05:11:26,979
my car is way too shitty. So I'm just going to go get the marijuana.

1227
05:11:53,180 --> 05:12:43,000
I don't even fucking care if the hood's up. Let's go. We're going to get the marijuana.

1228
05:12:43,000 --> 05:12:51,180
Some fucking geek comes over to the street race in like a fucking, in like a 2000 fucking,

1229
05:12:51,180 --> 05:13:02,729
like 13 camera or something puts lights on it, has a wooden spoiler, goes 70 miles per hour

1230
05:13:02,729 --> 05:13:18,950
and misses the first turn and goes into the ocean. All right. So you're telling me I climb up one of

1231
05:13:18,950 --> 05:13:24,549
these things and there's marijuana on top of one of the windmills. This feels like horse shit,

1232
05:13:24,549 --> 05:13:30,310
by the way. This feels like absolute horse shit. Like you made this up.

1233
05:13:31,479 --> 05:14:05,959
How am I going to climb the windmill? You made it up. You made it up. It's on the game's Wiki.

1234
05:14:05,959 --> 05:14:30,540
Oh shit. You didn't make it up. You've accused Chad of lying like five times now.

1235
05:14:32,169 --> 05:14:54,599
I would have bet, I would have bet $10,000 that that wasn't a log cutter. Cannabis seeds. Oh yeah.

1236
05:15:01,049 --> 05:15:16,409
Did they fall damage? I got weed seeds now. Who cares if I don't know how to drive?

1237
05:15:16,409 --> 05:15:52,360
I can just sell weed. All right. Get me out of here. Back to the road, which is over here,

1238
05:15:52,360 --> 05:16:06,729
right? The road over here. Okay. How do I go? How do I get out of here? I gotta get back into the

1239
05:16:06,729 --> 05:16:17,430
main road. Where's the main road? Am I on the road right now? I think I have to turn around.

1240
05:16:17,430 --> 05:16:36,840
It's so dark. I don't know where I am. Okay. This is it right here. Right. Am I going the right way?

1241
05:16:36,840 --> 05:17:05,560
I can't fucking read this map. It's too dark. I think it's this way, right? Right. That's right.

1242
05:17:05,560 --> 05:17:43,049
Right. I think this is, this is, this is, this is, this is, I don't know where I am. Windmills are

1243
05:17:43,130 --> 05:18:11,400
down here. Um, I actually don't know. I think this is correct. Am I just going in a circle?

1244
05:18:13,509 --> 05:18:17,349
I might just actually be going in a circle. Nope. Okay. I have, this is the garage,

1245
05:18:19,590 --> 05:18:30,040
which was, uh, I think I'm up. Okay. I just keep on this road.

1246
05:18:45,750 --> 05:18:50,700
This should take me all the way around, right? I can't read the scrap. Uh, yark. I don't know.

1247
05:18:50,700 --> 05:18:58,970
I can't get in. Yeah. Okay. I remember this. This is the next road to go this way. You can go down

1248
05:18:58,970 --> 05:19:07,900
here, which should take me, wrap me around past the windmills again, which will put me down at

1249
05:19:07,900 --> 05:19:22,549
the bottom part of that map. Think, right? Your car's on fire. It's not, it's just a little smoky.

1250
05:19:22,549 --> 05:19:37,979
Okay. Now I'm going the right way. Is the windmills are right next to me?

1251
05:19:37,979 --> 05:19:45,080
Like I go down and then I take a right. I think. No idea. Actually, I think it's,

1252
05:19:45,080 --> 05:19:47,479
I think it's the next time I can take a right, I can take a right.

1253
05:19:47,479 --> 05:20:02,840
Remember, it's your father. We need to change your oil. I think that's correct.

1254
05:20:02,840 --> 05:20:19,500
Think. Uh, you gotta change your oil every 3000 miles. This is, I just went in a circle.

1255
05:20:19,500 --> 05:20:28,889
I just wish I knew what direction I was even facing. The three windmills are over there on

1256
05:20:28,889 --> 05:20:34,279
the right. So I need to turn around and go that way and then take a right on that road.

1257
05:20:40,310 --> 05:20:53,049
I think we lost. Block the enemy race car with your truck or something.

1258
05:20:53,049 --> 05:20:56,889
Hold on. I need to get back to my house first. This is way more important.

1259
05:20:56,889 --> 05:21:08,700
I just went in a circle again. Go this way back this way. And then I take a right

1260
05:21:14,569 --> 05:21:19,459
this dirt road. All right. Thank God it's becoming daytime.

1261
05:21:19,459 --> 05:21:23,430
I can actually see what I'm doing. Here we go. All right. Let's go get out.

1262
05:21:28,599 --> 05:21:48,409
Okay. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I feel like I'm in a world of Warcraft

1263
05:21:48,409 --> 05:21:52,330
zone and I'm like, I hacked the game and I modded it and I'm in a car. I've done,

1264
05:21:52,330 --> 05:22:07,900
I feel like I'm not supposed to be driving a car here. I don't know where I'm going.

1265
05:22:15,189 --> 05:22:32,259
Oh my fucking God. I'm back at this. Please God help me. What do I keep doing wrong?

1266
05:22:32,259 --> 05:22:39,060
What do I keep doing? Just go back. Is the thing on the right,

1267
05:22:39,700 --> 05:22:44,169
that French word in the top right, is the thing on the top right,

1268
05:22:44,169 --> 05:22:50,599
is am I at a Wille Donk Jacks right now? Is that where I am? Is that where I am?

1269
05:22:52,630 --> 05:23:03,099
So if I turn around and just stay on this fucking road, then why does this thing say like

1270
05:23:03,099 --> 05:23:10,619
Jim's Automotive? What happened? A rock just hit me. All right. Slow down. I'm going to fucking

1271
05:23:10,619 --> 05:23:33,209
relax. So now if I just stay on this road and just stay left and then stay left again and just go

1272
05:23:33,209 --> 05:23:49,500
around, I don't fucking know, man, whatever. So just stay left, stay left both times that way.

1273
05:23:49,500 --> 05:24:03,590
Can I just get on the Griffin and fucking get out of here? 15 K people are watching you lost

1274
05:24:03,590 --> 05:24:23,849
in Westfall. I'm telling you, man, it's confusing. Not here. Okay. Take a left. Okay. Left. Stay left

1275
05:24:23,849 --> 05:24:27,450
and then stay left again. If I turn around another circle, I'm going to eat the monitor. I'm going to

1276
05:24:27,450 --> 05:24:40,419
just eat it one by one. I'm going to break the monitor over my knee and eat it. I'm so, my

1277
05:24:40,419 --> 05:24:57,779
character is so tired. Okay. Stay left again. And that should be, and then just go, I think, right?

1278
05:24:57,779 --> 05:25:40,819
Yeah. I got it. And then my house should be on my right. Please. Please. We're so close to Disneyland.

1279
05:25:56,939 --> 05:26:04,279
I tell you, I don't know where it is, honey. We already went down that road. That says Epcot.

1280
05:26:04,360 --> 05:26:10,279
Maybe if this place wasn't as big as fucking like four cities in Texas, we'd be able to figure out

1281
05:26:10,279 --> 05:26:15,380
where we were going. I don't know what the fuck happened. I swear to fucking God, man, I'm about

1282
05:26:15,380 --> 05:26:20,630
to just walk home and just use the truck and fuck this thing. Chop this thing up and throw it in the

1283
05:26:20,630 --> 05:27:09,159
trash. Who cares? I'm not a truck. Okay. I'm going the right way now, right? And just stay through

1284
05:27:09,159 --> 05:27:33,209
here. This is correct. No. Give me a goddamn blip on the map. Like honest to God. Just give me a

1285
05:27:33,209 --> 05:27:37,849
blip. Like there's so many weird twisty turns. Give me a blip on the map. Even if it, okay.

1286
05:27:37,849 --> 05:27:42,970
Even if it was like, this was your last known location 30 seconds ago, it would be better.

1287
05:27:42,970 --> 05:27:54,790
I would at least be able to know where the fuck I was going. Where am I now? The weed seeds are

1288
05:27:54,790 --> 05:27:58,229
fine. They're right there. All right. Now, now we're okay. Now I'm just straight here. Straight.

1289
05:28:05,240 --> 05:28:23,669
Straight again. Right? Yes. I'm about to drive into the fucking ocean. Buy a GPS.

1290
05:28:24,310 --> 05:28:41,459
The seeds are fine. They haven't moved. I promise. Go back. This is the wrong way.

1291
05:28:41,459 --> 05:28:54,380
Oh, it's the wrong way. Is it? Get me the fuck out of here. Oh, dad. Um, isn't it like already four

1292
05:28:54,380 --> 05:29:02,310
o'clock? It is. Yes, it is. Doesn't do. I think we missed the Donald Duck breakfast. It's all right.

1293
05:29:02,310 --> 05:29:11,110
It's okay. We're fine. We can't, son, son. Oh, son. Dad. Dad. Son, I'm coming.

1294
05:29:13,430 --> 05:29:31,430
Son. Get me out of the car now before I freak out. Give me these. It's all I care about. I don't care

1295
05:29:31,430 --> 05:29:37,509
if that thing fucking explodes. I don't care if this car explodes. I don't fucking care. Explode

1296
05:29:37,509 --> 05:29:42,069
for all I care. All I, I don't, the truck is way better. Why would you not have a truck? Let's go

1297
05:29:42,069 --> 05:29:47,509
over what trucks have. Versatility, four-wheel drive, space, speed. Don't overdrive a little

1298
05:29:47,509 --> 05:29:51,509
shit sedan like that. Why would you overdrive a sedan like that? The truck is 5,000 times better.

1299
05:29:51,509 --> 05:29:55,380
I wish I could put a better engine in this fucking bad boy. You know what I'm saying?

1300
05:29:55,380 --> 05:30:39,700
Where's the weed? I need to dig. We missed the Donald Duck breakfast. I have two seeds, right?

1301
05:30:39,700 --> 05:30:54,060
You need a harvest basket? Fuck off. I don't need a harvest basket. It's called use your hands like

1302
05:30:54,060 --> 05:31:07,830
a man and just rip them up. Dad, why are you planting seeds in the ground in our hotel?

1303
05:31:08,790 --> 05:31:17,259
Son, it's everything to be fine. Dad, the only thing we rode was it's a small world and that ride

1304
05:31:17,259 --> 05:31:23,610
sucks. That's right. I like that ride actually. I rode that three times in a row because nobody

1305
05:31:23,610 --> 05:31:30,869
fast passes that piece of shit. We can ride that as many times as you want, son. But I wanted to

1306
05:31:30,869 --> 05:31:37,209
ride Space Mountain. Space Mountain sucks. It's, you can't even see it. It's just dark. Who cares?

1307
05:31:37,849 --> 05:31:41,450
You don't even know you're on a roller coaster, son. Trust me, it's a small world. It's just

1308
05:31:41,450 --> 05:31:56,860
paying for your buck. Dad, don't you understand that it's going to take like four weeks for the

1309
05:31:56,860 --> 05:32:06,470
marijuana to grow? Son, I got fertilizer. It'll happen much faster. Are we planning on being

1310
05:32:06,470 --> 05:32:12,549
at Disney World for four weeks? I have to go to school. You don't have to go to school.

1311
05:32:15,349 --> 05:32:43,509
I'm not huffing that. He was spray painting the wall. Put it away. Put it away and get on with it.

1312
05:32:43,509 --> 05:32:56,810
Turn the car off. Water the plants and I'm going to sleep for a week and I'm just going to eat

1313
05:32:56,810 --> 05:33:01,290
food and sleep for a week and then I'm going to go back to that meet and greet at where all the

1314
05:33:01,290 --> 05:33:06,729
cars are and I'm going to sell weed to everybody and then it doesn't matter if I drive my car into

1315
05:33:06,729 --> 05:33:11,770
the ocean. It doesn't matter because I'm the guy that sells the weed. Precisely what we talked

1316
05:33:11,770 --> 05:33:16,009
about in the first like three hours of the stream. I'm not the guy that cuts the wood. I'm the guy

1317
05:33:16,009 --> 05:33:25,270
that I don't I'm not the guy that sells the weed. I don't do that. I'm just saying that like I don't

1318
05:33:25,270 --> 05:33:31,740
need to that was came out weird that came out very wrong. My point is it's like I don't have to drive

1319
05:33:31,740 --> 05:33:54,099
the car. I can do another activity and it's fine. Where did it go? Breaking bad. Marijuana is not

1320
05:33:54,900 --> 05:33:57,779
oh yeah I got marijuana in my possession.

1321
05:34:01,860 --> 05:34:03,779
He's got weed in his glove box.

1322
05:34:07,319 --> 05:34:14,740
Please it's just illegal in fucking all every county in America almost.

1323
05:34:14,740 --> 05:34:37,930
Dad why are you doing that? Why? Put it back. Breaking bad. I've got like a gram of marijuana

1324
05:34:37,930 --> 05:34:46,939
in my possession. Oh breaking bad. All right how does it look? How many days to take? How do I

1325
05:34:46,939 --> 05:34:52,659
harvest this? A harvesting basket. So let me go get a harvest. I'm gonna sleep 10 days in a row.

1326
05:34:53,220 --> 05:34:58,099
Harvesting basket. Would you get it from the store? Which just I'm gonna go to sleep again.

1327
05:34:58,099 --> 05:35:15,000
Who cares? Chill. You just slept. No. Go to bed now. Dad why do you keep humming that song?

1328
05:35:19,580 --> 05:35:32,630
Why are you doing air guitar? It's just marijuana. I can't sleep. So what am I supposed to do?

1329
05:35:33,270 --> 05:35:54,409
I guess I got wood. Car is still running. Why is this fucking seat? Dude okay

1330
05:35:55,049 --> 05:36:14,060
relax. Why is it so far up? Car is off. The lights are just on. Okay all right I'm going to use the

1331
05:36:14,060 --> 05:36:29,180
ATV. Should I? Is there gas in here? I haven't drove this yet. This sounds like fun. How do you

1332
05:36:29,180 --> 05:36:48,700
where's the ignition on an ATV? Does it even have one? Where is it in the middle? How do I think it

1333
05:36:48,700 --> 05:37:14,759
turns on? I mean I thought this thing here. How do I drive it? Parking brake. It obviously has gas.

1334
05:37:15,400 --> 05:37:50,169
Put it in gear? How do you put it in? I've never driven one of these before. R and F? That was fun.

1335
05:38:02,330 --> 05:38:25,860
All right go back to sleep. All right is R and F on the car too? I'm just so awake. Do I have

1336
05:38:25,860 --> 05:38:56,360
enough to turn it on and save? Oh shit. I'm out of gas too. Fuck me. Really? I'm just going into town

1337
05:38:56,360 --> 05:39:28,389
and waiting till it opens. Excuse me? Wait I already have a harvesting basket? Are you kidding

1338
05:39:28,389 --> 05:40:11,319
me? I actually do. No I don't. That's the Easter basket. That's the Easter basket. That's not it.

1342
05:41:21,259 --> 05:41:45,080
Why does your car have eyelashes? Why not? I just wish that they could blink. I wish I could like

1343
05:41:45,080 --> 05:41:52,220
blink my eyes without having it like mess with the lights. Have it be like transparent or something.

1344
05:41:52,220 --> 05:42:20,630
This is not Elden Ring? It is. What do you think you're watching? It's just a shit load of mods on

Seinfeld I kind of wish that they was like Seinfeld existed now imagine like the george is

1401
06:04:36,099 --> 06:04:45,299
a streamer episode he would accidentally walk in like naked or something right they get banned it

1402
06:04:45,299 --> 06:04:54,439
would be about how how george got like a like a 30-day twitch ban you didn't turn off the stream

1403
06:04:54,439 --> 06:05:02,549
you didn't hit this end stream button I thought I did I stuff and the kramer comes in yeah I stream

1404
06:05:02,549 --> 06:05:10,630
too another website it's called like chatterbait or something right he's like doing porn and and

1405
06:05:10,630 --> 06:05:34,900
kramer thinks that george is also doing like chatterbait that's too specific oh but go back

1406
06:05:34,900 --> 06:05:50,790
to bed I want those things just to grow by chatterbait I don't know it'd be like if I

1407
06:05:51,509 --> 06:06:04,819
kramer has like been doing that I guess for a long time and okay and george is talking about

1408
06:06:04,819 --> 06:06:09,860
streaming on twitch but kramer's talking about streaming on like chatterbait so but they don't

1409
06:06:10,419 --> 06:06:17,220
you know what I mean like they don't understand that they're different places until the very end

1410
06:06:17,220 --> 06:06:23,240
where kramer is like oh I'm gonna go live on george's computer and he's like taking his clothes

1426
06:10:18,299 --> 06:10:39,740
everything you say they're so nice oh we're going up omega lol true they are kind of nice

1427
06:10:39,740 --> 06:11:16,630
it is pretty fun we want him to feel good about himself so we do that I would love a Seinfeld in

1428
06:11:16,630 --> 06:11:31,020
current times I guess that's kind of Larry David that's Kirby enthusiasm right now right he hasn't

1429
06:11:31,020 --> 06:11:38,180
been actually funny since the sorcery streams you're seeing the first streams that I really

1430
06:11:38,180 --> 06:11:42,979
kind of really went in hard on on twitch seven years ago were the only things I ever did that

1431
06:11:42,979 --> 06:11:56,659
you liked interesting where's the truck can you go a little bit further a little bit further up

1432
06:11:56,659 --> 06:12:20,500
here it's my stop you're all nasty stop it all right get up get up get up how do I get up thank

1433
06:12:20,500 --> 06:12:39,159
you I've been watching you for 10 years that's that's ridiculous I can't believe I've been doing

1434
06:12:39,159 --> 06:12:46,139
this for that long you know sometimes like you just think in my brain like three or four years ago

1435
06:12:46,139 --> 06:12:59,259
it was like it was it was like 10 years ago it's weird it's ridiculous I did not expect it to be

1436
06:12:59,259 --> 06:13:14,709
going this fast because it's carbon on the whole time no god I do it every time it three years ago

1437
06:13:14,709 --> 06:13:24,389
feels like 10 years ago the other way around right yes I meant to say the other way around

1438
06:13:24,389 --> 06:13:41,400
all right let's go back home that should be enough time for the weed to grow I need to go

1439
06:13:41,400 --> 06:13:50,439
that way it makes me think now I know we've kind of been messing around this whole time just

1440
06:13:50,439 --> 06:14:02,409
fucking around but real talk if 10 years went by that fast another 10 years is that's kind of

1441
06:14:02,409 --> 06:14:12,200
ridiculous that's insane to think about that like 10 years from now I hope it doesn't go that fast

1442
06:14:12,919 --> 06:15:06,860
are you gonna stream in your 40s I'm not even 40 yet relax he's gonna do something even cooler

1443
06:15:06,860 --> 06:15:14,659
you know here's the wild thing oh eventually eventually you're gonna stop doing this right

1444
06:15:14,659 --> 06:15:28,020
eventually what when I think of the things that I want to do and there's a lot of things that

1445
06:15:28,020 --> 06:15:36,900
I'd like to do like going forward right uh but it's gonna be hard to match like how I feel about

1446
06:15:36,900 --> 06:15:42,580
this forget about like money forget about anything I'm just talking like to be able to match how I

1447
06:15:42,580 --> 06:15:51,099
feel about this doing this I have other things that I'm equally passionate about right but

1448
06:15:51,819 --> 06:15:57,560
I don't know it's gonna be weird it's gonna be hard but we're not talking about that right now

1449
06:15:57,560 --> 06:16:03,270
because that's not happening right now we're not talking about that right now because that's not

1450
06:16:03,270 --> 06:16:06,630
happening right now everyone relax what we're doing is we're eating poutine and we're making

1451
06:16:06,630 --> 06:16:17,080
we're growing weed in our backyard retirement randy not yet 38 all right let's go some more

1452
06:16:17,159 --> 06:16:25,979
water on there I did not say eating poop see we're eating poop and growing weed in our

1453
06:16:25,979 --> 06:16:54,330
backyards son save the game go to sleep I'm gonna turn this on no no go to sleep then save the game

1454
06:16:54,330 --> 06:17:28,150
that makes more sense to me become a cod streamer no no I don't think so I don't think so you're

1455
06:17:28,150 --> 06:17:49,689
gonna become a family man because maybe I'll become Peter Griffin Peter Griffin in real life

1456
06:17:49,689 --> 06:18:12,790
you're gonna go back to making tf2 tutorials become a game show host that's kind of a good

1457
06:18:12,790 --> 06:18:20,810
gig isn't it right if I if I just like was I hosted real fortune I don't know one's gonna

1458
06:18:20,810 --> 06:18:40,139
give me that job I would watch it if it was you I'd watch the hell out of that what is that for

1459
06:18:40,139 --> 06:18:54,500
almost halfway there we're there come on how can I make time pass very quickly I could cut some more

1460
06:18:54,500 --> 06:19:09,369
wood sleep I can't my energy is full build the sugar shack I don't even know how to do that

1461
06:19:13,500 --> 06:19:30,439
build the sugar shack but I don't buggy pack installed oh buggy part this thing I need more

1462
06:19:30,439 --> 06:19:52,380
buggy parts that's annoying that the muffler is gone that would have been fun oh I know why it's

1463
06:19:52,380 --> 06:20:01,020
so bright because I'm shining the headlights into the house high beams actual high beams into the

1464
06:20:01,020 --> 06:20:26,229
house we were trying to figure that out for so long what time is it were you a teacher or was

1465
06:20:26,229 --> 06:20:38,700
that a bit I was never a teacher I did substitute but any you don't need a teaching degree to

1466
06:20:38,700 --> 06:20:58,220
substitute teach let's go take a stroll with this thing why not why is this dead there's plenty of

1467
06:20:58,220 --> 06:21:11,529
gas in here why is this dead no you don't you don't need a teaching degree you do not need a

1468
06:21:11,529 --> 06:21:19,560
teaching degree to be a substitute unless that has changed in the last 10 to 15 years which maybe

1469
06:21:19,560 --> 06:21:33,689
it has I don't think so oh you still don't know it's probably per state that does not seem right

1470
06:21:33,689 --> 06:21:42,520
to be honest um I mean the issue is if you had to require like a masters in education to sub

1471
06:21:42,520 --> 06:21:46,819
it might be really hard to find a substitute because if you had masters in education

1472
06:21:47,849 --> 06:21:52,569
you'd be a teacher you'd be you'd do like teachers aid and then you become a teacher you wouldn't do

1473
06:21:52,569 --> 06:22:05,139
subbing really maybe you would for a little while different states probably have different criteria

1474
06:22:08,790 --> 06:22:12,470
I'm sure there's plenty of teachers that start doing substitute teaching for a while

1475
06:22:13,029 --> 06:22:21,450
and then you move on to like teachers aid stuff and then again do teaching it would be nice if

1476
06:22:22,090 --> 06:22:31,159
hold on hold on hold on it'd be nice if teachers made way more money

1477
06:22:31,159 --> 06:22:47,220
hold on you know we you know that we pay teachers like such a shit amount of money and the incentive

1478
06:22:47,220 --> 06:22:54,740
to be a teacher is like not that fucking great really and these are the people that are like

1479
06:22:54,740 --> 06:23:04,790
developing our children's brains I don't I don't understand how that makes any sense

1480
06:23:04,790 --> 06:23:13,450
arguably one of the most important jobs in the world and they make fucking nothing why that's

1481
06:23:13,450 --> 06:23:24,250
so strange that's such an that's such an important job it's so important it really is I forgot let's

1482
06:23:24,250 --> 06:23:50,299
go I didn't just sleep most of them can't so what was it they get the summer off yeah but that's

1483
06:23:50,299 --> 06:24:01,799
I mean trust me when I say that having to teach students is like you need that time you need that

1484
06:24:01,799 --> 06:24:07,020
time and teachers aren't just kind of lounging around in a fucking lounge chair for the summer

1485
06:24:07,020 --> 06:24:12,869
a lot of them are planning their lesson plans they you they might not be in the classroom for

1486
06:24:12,869 --> 06:24:20,490
three or four months but they have to get ready they have to get prepared when you go to your

1487
06:24:20,490 --> 06:24:27,080
class right you're not necessarily oh I'm just here and the teachers just got a whole lesson

1488
06:24:27,080 --> 06:24:33,029
plan ready to go now there are a lot of shit teachers I had teachers that I thought were

1489
06:24:33,029 --> 06:24:38,860
fucking terrible but maybe if we incentivized being a fucking teacher and they didn't make

1490
06:24:38,860 --> 06:24:44,540
like fucking like like nine dollars an hour or whatever the fuck it is like on the average

1491
06:24:44,540 --> 06:24:51,220
like 12 dollars an hour or something maybe people will be way more incentivized to be a teacher and

1492
06:24:51,220 --> 06:25:05,610
take it fucking seriously earn his mic up all right honestly I don't I don't care how you

1493
06:25:05,610 --> 06:25:11,099
feel about the world forget about political leanings anything doesn't matter I think we

1494
06:25:11,099 --> 06:25:19,979
can all agree that just like spitted by bed well we could all agree on that we could all agree on

1495
06:25:19,979 --> 06:25:27,580
that uh I think that we really need to make teaching way more incentivized and the lesson

1496
06:25:27,580 --> 06:25:33,860
plan's got to get updated too yeah we I can talk for an hour about this we need to talk about like

1497
06:25:33,860 --> 06:25:40,310
credit and fucking taxes and how to take care of yourself and shit and because I didn't fucking

1498
06:25:40,310 --> 06:25:47,049
learn that stuff till I was like in my mid-20s it's fuck it sucks my parents helped a lot right

1499
06:25:47,049 --> 06:25:53,509
my parents like told me some of these things but man I don't give a fuck about like geometry too

1500
06:25:54,939 --> 06:25:59,340
help me help fucking help these goddamn people help these goddamn kids learn some shit that

1501
06:25:59,340 --> 06:26:11,779
actually helped their life help out their future and shit I didn't give a fuck about geometry too

1502
06:26:12,500 --> 06:26:16,900
geometry is important I fucking hated geometry there's too many fucking lines I didn't like it

1503
06:26:22,540 --> 06:26:31,450
insurance yeah there's like so much shit to know and dude you know what a lot of people don't

1504
06:26:31,450 --> 06:26:38,490
really know what they're doing or what they want to do or what they want to be when they're 16 17

1505
06:26:38,490 --> 06:26:46,099
18 19 and we tell everybody oh hey uh by the way when you're like 17 18 you better know what the

1506
06:26:46,099 --> 06:26:53,290
fuck you want to do with your life go to college immediately go um go to trade school go um I don't

1507
06:26:53,290 --> 06:27:00,439
kind of know what the fuck I want to do I have this opinion that after high school there should

1508
06:27:00,439 --> 06:27:07,990
be a period where like of a year or two maybe even a year it's just a program for you to figure out

1509
06:27:07,990 --> 06:27:12,630
kind of without the anxiety of like oh my god I gotta fucking figure out how I'm gonna pay for

1510
06:27:12,630 --> 06:27:17,349
college I gotta figure out what I want to do with my life a gap year a gap a two-year gap year to

1511
06:27:17,349 --> 06:27:22,700
your two years in a gap for you to be able to figure out what you want to do even if you don't

1512
06:27:22,700 --> 06:27:26,220
get it completely right even if you're not completely exactly correct you'll be closer

1513
06:27:26,220 --> 06:27:37,380
than you were two years ago we we just push kids out of high school directly into another

1514
06:27:37,380 --> 06:27:43,340
thing that they're forced that they feel like they're forced to do and I was one of those

1515
06:27:43,340 --> 06:27:48,229
people I was one of those kids when I was like 17 18 19 I was I didn't know what the fuck I

1516
06:27:48,229 --> 06:27:54,200
wanted to do I thought I did but there is a lot of pressure to be like all right I guess I'm gonna

1517
06:27:54,200 --> 06:27:58,939
go to college or I kind of have to do something right because I gotta do something with my I

1518
06:27:58,939 --> 06:28:06,740
gotta do something with my life like I gotta hurry up I think we should kind of reevaluate that

1519
06:28:06,740 --> 06:28:30,549
people will be way better prepared if programs like that existed 52 we're almost ready to smoke weed

1520
06:28:30,549 --> 06:28:35,990
and this is not like some kind of wow what what a genius topic you're bringing up you're so

1521
06:28:35,990 --> 06:28:41,029
tons of people have thought about this and talked about this right I think it's it would be so

1522
06:28:41,029 --> 06:28:48,979
important because I think of me when I was younger and if I had some time and I could kind of do like

1523
06:28:48,979 --> 06:28:55,770
a pre-college or like a post high school kind of year where it wasn't a bunch of pressure it was

1524
06:28:55,770 --> 06:29:14,900
just all right let's figure it out almost ready and not a big financial burden a bunch bunch of

1525
06:29:14,900 --> 06:29:24,340
money you got to spend because I'm getting heated here when you start to spend a shitload of money

1526
06:29:24,340 --> 06:29:32,619
in the years where you're not sure exactly what you want to do a lot of people kind of get trapped

1527
06:29:32,619 --> 06:29:37,349
and you end up a couple of years in college or even doing like trade school and going into like

1528
06:29:37,909 --> 06:29:43,560
one of like the trade unions or something and if you don't have it right you have thrown a

1529
06:29:43,560 --> 06:29:52,860
shitload of money into the fucking trash I don't think I don't think that's okay I think that sucks

1530
06:29:52,860 --> 06:29:59,290
changing your major tons of people did that tons of people were doing that when I was in college

1531
06:29:59,290 --> 06:30:03,049
and it's like man imagine if you were able to figure that out and then you didn't have to

1532
06:30:03,049 --> 06:30:19,049
have the insane loans for the two or three years or a year or two and you're ready to go tell them

1533
06:30:19,049 --> 06:30:36,150
sis you're explaining how wow we we we we that's not what happened compare it with the rest of the

1534
06:30:36,150 --> 06:30:47,270
world I just think that we we could be doing things a lot better you should do a podcast about this

1535
06:30:47,270 --> 06:30:53,189
no no I'm not smart enough to trust me I am not fucking smart enough I am not the person you want

1536
06:30:53,189 --> 06:30:59,270
to be listening to with this kind of shit I'm just telling you how I feel you do trust me I don't

1537
06:30:59,270 --> 06:31:05,500
have the resources I don't have the brain to handle this kind of stuff I can speak on a couple of

1538
06:31:05,500 --> 06:31:17,669
small things I can that's it come on hurry up and weed hurry up you should be prime minister no I

1539
06:31:17,669 --> 06:31:36,869
should not why is the truck in the ground I probably rolled it's fine and also hmm I think

1540
06:31:36,869 --> 06:31:45,590
that people are inefficient the more that they're doing something excuse me I think that a four-day

1541
06:31:45,590 --> 06:31:53,189
work week increases efficiency excuse me I'm just I'm telling you I think the more that you like

1542
06:31:53,189 --> 06:32:02,409
have to stay and do something in a row you get exhausted and you don't want to do it I'm not

1543
06:32:02,409 --> 06:32:08,169
even a four-day work and look people a lot of people like to kind of really hunker down I know

1544
06:32:08,169 --> 06:32:15,529

burn time the marijuana plants and I'm like all right I guess I'm just gonna keep doing it

1647
06:59:35,529 --> 06:59:48,009
