1
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:40,840
I can't put it on here. What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, hold on. I think I got it.

2
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:55,320
There we go. All right. All right. Let's do a bread tier list. Look up the ending.

3
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:07,590
I don't... true endings. I don't need true ending. That doesn't have to be true ending.

4
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,219
All right, let's get it. Bread tier list.

5
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:32,379
Oh, it's just small. My windows always get so fucked up.

6
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,989
Okay. So this is a very important tier list for a lot of you, I think.

7
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,359
Um, I can see it better. All right, I'm gonna... I'm quitting this. We don't need to be in here

8
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,840
anymore. This is... that game was really cool. It was really like just a chill game.

9
00:01:53,079 --> 00:02:06,150
I liked it a lot. All right, bread tier list. I'm ready. Put on Olive Garden music for this.

10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:23,270
Actually kind of a fucking good idea. There's a lot on this list. All right, right there.

11
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:32,379
That's where it is. All right, let's make it a little bigger. All right, you guys ready?

12
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,240
The quintessential bread tier list. Sourdough's number one.

13
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,240
What the fuck?

14
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,280
Oh my god. No, it's not. I want that person timed out. I actually want you timed out.

15
00:02:48,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Uh, can we make this IRL? I need music though. You're right.

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:17,689
Uh, Garden... Olive Garden music? Olive Garden theme song. Club remix? It's a club remix.

17
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:35,240
Why is there a club remix of this? This is a club remix. This is Olive Garden?

18
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:51,669
I don't think this is even the Olive Garden. Okay, here we go. Bagel. That's a straight up A.

19
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,530
Bagel can be used as a sandwich topping. Can be used as a breakfast, as a lunch, as a dinner.

20
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,490
You can do bagels and lox. You can do bagels, eggs, and cheese. You can do bagel tuna sandwich.

21
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:14,120
Versatility. Hawaiian roll. S. Hawaiian roll S. 100%. No fighting me on that one. Hawaiian rolls

22
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:26,709
are S. S. If you buy a bag of Hawaiian rolls, you better be ready for that bag to be gone

23
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:39,610
within a day. Within one day. They don't last long. You will never take a bag of Hawaiian rolls

24
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,329
and turn it like this and go, is that mold? Oh no, there's like eight. There's like how many

25
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:47,769
slices are in there? One, two, three, four, five. I think that's mold. Nope. Never gonna happen.

26
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:56,420
It's gone every time. Oatmeal bread. Yeah. Okay. Rye bread. Uh, it's a D. Unless it's with a

27
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:10,310
Reuben sandwich and then it becomes a B. Brioche? A. Bagels are better. A whole wheat bread? I guess

28
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,740
it's an F. I fucking hate wheat bread. It sucks. I feel... I know. I... When anytime anybody says,

29
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,389
hey, whiter wheat. I go, bro, white every time. Like I don't like wheat bread. I just don't.

30
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,750
It just makes it taste different. It tastes... Bread to me is texture and a little bit of flavor.

31
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,829
Whole wheat bread changes like the flavor of a sandwich. Sure. I don't care. Call me whatever

32
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,470
you want. Banana bread. This is a very close to S. I'm not sure I want to put this in S. I'm gonna

33
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,029
put it in A. It depends. There's really shitty banana bread and there's really great banana bread.

34
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:50,569
There's banana breads that are dog shit, but if you get a moist, a dense moist banana bread,

35
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:58,870
wow, that's absolute A+. Cornbread is also the same. There's a lot of really shitty cornbread.

36
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:08,180
Dry cornbread. If you get the real good stuff, this might level up. Maybe. Depends. I think it's...

37
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:17,529
I think so. Cinnamon bread. F. I'm sorry. I just don't like it. I am not a fan of cinnamon.

38
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,189
You all know that. Everybody knows that at this point. This channel has been... This channel

39
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:28,420
started with me hating cinnamon. I don't really like cinnamon as a condiment, as a seasoning. I'm

40
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,860
not a fan. I actually don't think it belongs... These actually probably both don't belong in F,

41
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:42,279
but... Are people saying quackity? What do you mean quackity? What? Oh, they gifted subs.

42
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:54,170
What's up, quackity? Anyways, we're doing good takes here. Croissants. Croissants are an S for

43
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,459
flavor, but an F for practicality. Eating a croissant, you have to vacuum your shirt.

44
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:19,000
What is this song? This is not Olive Garden. Yeah, when you eat croissants, they're delicious,

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,160
but you literally have to vacuum your clothes afterwards. Hold on. I'll put it in the right

46
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:31,110
spot. I need some restaurant music. Here we go. There we go. That's more Olive Garden.

47
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:41,480
Croissant is F for malleability, mandible ability, whatever it's called.

48
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,120
We're talking flavor only, and I have like a tray underneath that I can catch the croissant

49
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,970
crumbles. I'm going to give it an A. Biscuits. Some biscuits, they're dry as fuck a lot of times,

50
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,889
but you know what? I'm going to have to... People are going to be mad about this,

51
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:05,899
but I'm going to give it a B. I already know where this is going, so I need to do this now.

52
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,779
Let's get this out of the way, because people are going to be mad. English muffins are horrible.

53
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,500
English muffins just have a bad taste. I don't like it. I don't really... I really don't like

54
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:27,990
English muffins. English muffins to me taste like somebody made a bagel biscuit, like a biscuit,

55
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:34,250
and they put a droplet of artificial bread flavoring on it. I don't know. I don't like

56
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,409
the taste. It tastes like baby powder. When I bite into an English muffin, it's like baby powder.

57
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:50,090
Okay, a McDonald's sausage egg McMuffin. Yeah, I'd eat it. That brings it up to here,

58
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,059
but I really don't like English muffins. I'm sorry. I just don't.

59
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:04,070
I don't... What is it? What is yeast bread? What is that? Yeast bread? Isn't that just bread? I kind

60
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:12,139
of don't really know what that is, so I'm going to... What is it? Just bread? Bagels are failed

61
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:22,620
donuts. They're vile creations. A bagel is amazing. A bagel is versatile. I'm just going to... I don't

62
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,179
know what to put this on. Potato bread. Yes. Potato bread is everything I like about white bread,

63
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,659
but it's not just default shitty white bread, right? But I like default shitty white bread.

64
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,980
I don't think it's better than Hawaiian roll, but I think potato bread is like... If you want

65
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,379
white bread, potato bread is like the cool version. I love potato bread. It's fantastic.

66
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,460
Not only does this have cinnamon in it, it has gross raisins too.

67
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:03,139
This is going down here. Cinnamon raisin bread. No, I'm just not into it. Where's white bread? Let's

68
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:15,340
do it. White bread is like a B. No, white bread is like a C. I probably would rather eat white

69
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,840
bread than oatmeal bread though, because what even... What is oatmeal bread? I don't like

70
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:28,460
cinnamons. I don't like cinnamons, like raisins and shit. I don't like that. Flat bread is... It's

71
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,700
all right. It's good for like little sandwich rolls and everything. Tortilla. Flour tortilla.

72
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,320
Is corn tortilla on here? Well, that wouldn't be bread, would it? Okay, but this is S. I love

73
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:52,340
tortilla. A good flour tortilla. Cook it on the stove. Oh yeah. Hell yeah. Absolutely. So good.

74
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:01,539
So good. Sourdough. Sourdough is... I would say it kind of reminds me of

75
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:20,629
biting into something like... You know why I don't like sourdough bread? Here's why. That's why.

76
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:30,899
Every piece of sourdough I've ever had feels like that. Oh, wow. Oh, sourdough. Oh my god,

77
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:47,399
it's so fresh. I can feel it in my mouth. I have to bite down hard. No. The sourdough flavor

78
00:11:49,019 --> 00:12:01,980
is up here. I'm willing to forgive sourdough for being like tough and chewy. Plus too, it still

79
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:11,320
fucks though. Why are you fucking bread? What are you talking about? I'd say it's... I'm going to

80
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:19,350
give it a B. I think it tastes good. It's better than white bread. Garlic bread. Oh, garlic bread.

81
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,110
Garlic bread's... But that's just a meme answer though. Do I really think garlic bread's better

82
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:35,419
than like banana bread? Okay, is garlic bread better than cornbread? I don't think so. I mean,

83
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:42,500
I love garlic bread, but is it better than like a good moist banana bread? Probably not. Or a good

84
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,389
bagel? Like a fresh bagel. God, if you get a fresh bagel from like a bagel factory, one of those like

85
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,190
bagel factories restaurants where they make the bagels there and they're fresh and you get it hot

86
00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:03,029
right in the morning, I think it's better. I do. French bread is in the same category as croissant.

87
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,789
It's another bread that when you take a bite out of it, you need like a little dirt devil to vacuum

88
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:11,750
your like crotch because it just gets everywhere, but it's fucking unbelievable. I think it's better

89
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,350
than croissant. I think it's better than brioche too. French bread just like is garlic bread just

90
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:31,500
with stuff on it. So what is it? Does it really matter where it goes? Whole grain bread is at the

91
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:42,149
very bottom. I would rather eat cinnamon raisin bread off the ground than eat a piece of whole

92
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:53,559
grain bread. It's awful. I know. Oh, you're like, you have like a 10 year old's palette.

93
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,559
Whole grain bread sucks and everybody knows it. You don't bite into whole like all like the weird

94
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,720
like nuts and shit. I don't like the plastic tasting things. It's like the big chunks of like

95
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,779
grains and like little like seeds on it. It's like, it's like bird food to me. It's like bird seed

96
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,980
all over it. I don't like it. It's got bird seed all over it. I don't like whole grain bread. I

97
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:26,100
think it's bad. Pretzel bread is up here. In fact, pretzel bread is better than Hawaiian rolls.

98
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,620
I might come back to that in a minute. I might come back to this in just a moment,

99
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:43,879
but pretzel bread could be the best thing in the world. Bread-wise, I think. We'll see. I can change

100
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:52,649
it if I need to. Well, okay, potato bread is not a 10 year old palette. That's like pretty

101
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:59,940
sophisticated. Hawaiian rolls, that's a sophisticated palette. Pita bread's pretty good. I think it's

102
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:11,320
like a B. I love gyros, so pita bread's usually pretty fantastic. This with hummus is fantastic.

103
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:23,850
I don't think I would put it up here though. I mean, breadsticks are fine, but they're fine.

104
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,460
I like breadsticks. I don't think they're better than like a croissant. Actually,

105
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,809
yeah. I probably, okay, do I, would I rather have a breadstick or a pita bread?

106
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:39,700
Probably a breadstick. I might have to reevaluate this in a minute in a little bit here. We'll see.

107
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:45,940
All right, this is the bread from Outback. We know where that's going. Up here somewhere.

108
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:54,820
But okay, pumpernickel bread and croissants are the exact same in my brain. I need to be

109
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:00,100
in the mood to eat a croissant. I don't just like, oh, you know what? Yeah, I'll have a croissant

110
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,720
today. That'd be a reason why I get it, why I eat it. Pumpernickel is like, I have to have a reason

111
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,960
to eat it. I don't go to the store and go like, oh yeah, yeah, where's the pumpernickel bread?

112
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,120
No, I usually get like potato bread or the stick of white bread or even a wheat bread sometimes.

113
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:26,090
Is the bread from Outback? Yeah, it is good. That's why it's an A. It's up an A tier. What

114
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:37,379
are you talking about? Outback bread is white bread painted brown. Is it really? No, it's not.

115
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:53,220
What is the bread from Outback? It's not pumpernickel? What is the bread at Outback?

116
00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:01,899
What is the bread at Outback made out of? Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.

117
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:21,930
But no, wheat bread sucks. Wait, that's a honey and molasses. Honey and molasses wheat bread roll.

118
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,569
Not just generic ass wheat bread. No, they're both going down here. Fuck them both.

119
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:36,099
Fuck them both. Who cares? Non is up at A, high A. To me, a non is like a pita bread, but like

120
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:44,259
evolved. Pita bread's like the squirtle and non is like the squirrel mo, whatever his name is,

121
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:50,339
whatever. Non is just like kind of upgraded pita bread. I don't think it's better than garlic,

122
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:57,930
but it actually might be. Maybe. Pumpernickel, I like pumpernickel. Why is it down here?

123
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,960
It's definitely like up here. It'd be zucchini bread. I don't know. That's some TikTok shit.

124
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:24,309
I don't want it. Butter bread and butter bread. What is it? What are these? I don't think I've

125
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:30,630
had these before. I don't think I've eaten butter bread. I don't think I've had it.

126
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,660
Where would I have eaten this? My grandmother makes zucchini bread, dude. That's not TikTok shit.

127
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:52,549
I don't know. It's zucchini bread? The Chick-fil-A minis are butter bread. I don't, I don't,

128
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,769
I can't think of, I can't remember what it tastes like. What it is like, right? All right, let me

129
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:03,539
make sure this is correct. Pretzel bread, yep. Wine roll, this is tough. Yeah, this is right.

130
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:17,769
I think my S tier is right. A good fresh French roll, though. God damn it, it's good. I'm trying

131
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:24,599
to think of like biting into like a moist, delicious, savory, aromatic piece of banana

132
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,650
bread. You know what I mean? The kind of bread where you can go like this with the bread,

133
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,210
squish it and you let go and it does not come back to form factor. It's squished. It's fucking

134
00:19:35,210 --> 00:20:05,380
squished. Oh, that changed my mind. No, cornbread or flour tortilla. I feel like brioche is just

135
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:14,759
better than most of these somehow, right? But I don't know. I love bagels so much. I can eat

136
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,980
bagels, breakfast, breakfast, lunch. Why can't I say the K in breakfast? I could eat a bagel,

137
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:30,859
breakfast, lunch and dinner and be happy about it. Here's the exact same tier list from a year

138
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:54,819
and a half ago that you did. What? Are you serious? I did this already? This is my list?

139
00:20:54,819 --> 00:21:00,490
I did this already? So what does it look like? Oh, someone's got a screenshot. Here we go. Wait,

140
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:07,240
hold on. I need to compare. Let's compare it. It's pretty fucking close, guys. It's pretty close.

141
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:21,160
It's pretty close. It's close, man. Hold on. If I were to stop this right now, right? Let's overlay

142
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:40,170
it. Yo, this is pretty much the same. This is pretty good. What's not up here? Croissant is

143
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:52,579
up at S now. Potato bread, potato bread. Pretzel bread, pretzel bread. Croissant. I must have had

144
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:57,900
a shitty croissant. I must add a shitty croissant. You know, at some point over the last two years,

145
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:06,660
I probably bit into a croissant and went fuck and got pissed. That is what happened.

146
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,059
Banana bread. Yeah, I must have had a really moist banana bread. Biscuit. Biscuits. Whoa,

147
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:19,779
it took a nose dive here. Pita bread took a dive. Then flatbread took a dive. Cornbread evolved.

148
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:29,900
White bread kind of jumped up. Oatmeal bread. Okay, but yeah, but remember, all these things

149
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,380
that are in D, I was afraid to piss off like the bread andies in chat, right? So I couldn't make

150
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:47,579
them F. Where's garlic bread on this? Wow, garlic bread was a fucking C. I stand by my list. You did

151
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:55,589
this exact same list already. I'm kind of curious. What does somebody... I did a fast food one.

152
00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:16,359
Are my tastes kind of the same? You were wearing the same shirt. I was? No, I wasn't. You just

153
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,289
did the fast food. What's another one that I've done? What's some of the popular ones? It's like

154
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:27,640
candy, soda, chips and stuff, right? What's one that I haven't done in a while that I have done

155
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:39,289
to see if... Because I don't remember. I don't remember anything. Cheese's baby food. You did

156
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:50,119
fruits before. Pumpkin bread. I don't like it. You did the same grin. You didn't do cookie run

157
00:23:50,119 --> 00:24:02,970
characters yet. All right, so should I... What's another one? This is done. I'm happy with this.

158
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:12,119
Should I do like soda, candy? Is there a good candy one? I've been eating a shitload of candy

159
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:19,019
lately. Should I do a candy or something? What do you think? I've been eating a lot of candy. I've

160
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:26,519
been really into candy lately. Do alcohol? I could do that. I don't even need a tier list. Vodka,

161
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:33,579
S, everything else fucking like F, besides like whiskey at like an A. Beer, F. Wine, like A. There

162
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:44,150
you go. Is there a good candy one? You did candy in 2020. Okay, so it's been about two years. I

163
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:58,299
don't remember what I did. So is there a good candy one? Give me a good candy one. He have two

164
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:05,079
unusual hats. I don't even know. Guys, I've seen like three unusual hats my whole life. Have you

165
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,460
eaten much candy since then? Yeah, I think so. There's a candy tier list right here. Let's check

166
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,339
it out. Vodka, is that so? Yeah, because vodka goes with like almost everything. That's the only reason

167
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:23,589
why. I like whiskey too, but vodka is like easier for me to drink. I don't really drink that much

168
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:28,759
hard alcohol. Usually it's just a wine or like champagne or something, right? Okay, candy.

169
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,619
Let me put it down. Okay, how long is this? This is gonna take like an hour. This is gonna take like

170
00:25:44,619 --> 00:26:02,359
a fucking hour, isn't it? This doesn't feel complete. Is this complete? What do you guys think?

171
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:12,250
Is there more on here that should be on here? No, this looks pretty complete. Is it the same

172
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:25,400
one that I did? I think this looks kind of complete. What's it missing? Looks pretty good.

173
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:39,480
Looks good. Okay, let's start at the with the easy stuff that I know. Um, Reese's Pieces are an A,

174
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,309
although eating more than like what? What's touching my leg? What? I honestly got there was

175
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:58,980
like a fucking thing on my leg. What was that? Okay, uh, Reese's Pieces are pretty good. I would

176
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:06,099
say they're A. I would say Twizzlers are D or F. D is fine. We can use it as F. Twizzlers are gross.

177
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,059
There's only one kind of Twizzler I like and it's the ones where you peel, you peel the Twizzlers.

178
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,099
Those are pretty good. Bazooka Gum. If you can find one that isn't as hard as a rock,

179
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:26,329
that's, I'd say that's pretty solid B. A hundred grand. I remember the commercials where they'd

180
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:30,730
say, what would you do with a hundred grand? I'd eat it. So that gets a B for like funny commercial.

181
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:38,390
No, it doesn't. Let's just get this out of the way. Reese's the best candy. Reese's are the best

182
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:44,940
candy. There's no, I honestly, I don't think there's any argument to be made. There really isn't.

183
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:55,750
No, there is no argument to make. It's the best candy. It's the best chocolate candy.

184
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:01,529
You know what else? I'm going to give Reese's a little bit of credit here. They also haven't

185
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:07,640
changed shit. There's been no new recipe for Reese's. It's the same goddamn shit it was like

186
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,759
50 years ago. Think about it. Remember, think about the things that you think about that go like,

187
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,160
oh man, back in the nineties when like it tasted better and they used like fucking whatever.

188
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:29,670
It's the same. This has not changed in like fucking 40 years. Sour Patch Kids. Nah,

189
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:37,700
I don't like these. They're, I like eating like one or two. I like them, but I just, I only want

190
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:49,539
like two. I really only want like two. I'll keep it in B for now. I know they're good. I like them,

191
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:56,150
but I just don't, I don't want to eat like a whole bag. Bubble Tape is A. If you can find it,

192
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,650
it's amazing. Although it does have like the weird like baby powder shit on it.

193
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:18,650
I'll keep it for now. I love it though. Sweet Tarts. Are these the, yep, those are S. Absolutely,

194
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:25,940
100%. Sweet Tarts are so delicious. They're so yummy. I can eat a Sweet Tart and it's the same

195
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:35,079
exact thing. Sweet Tarts are Sour Patch Kids, but good. Sweet Tarts are like Sour Candy, Sour Patch

196
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:44,650
Kids. They're just like a better version in my brain than a Sour Patch Kid. I just feel that way.

197
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:50,230
Fun Dip is also kind of, I can only do it once or twice. It's good, but I don't know. I'll keep it

198
00:29:50,230 --> 00:30:02,410
in B for now. Mike and Ike's, I don't, there's just no reason to eat them. Original Tootsie Rolls.

199
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:11,740
These are, they're, they're not, I don't know. They're kind of just the, Heath Bar is like a C

200
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:19,779
or a B, but if it's part of ice cream, it's S. Like Heath Bar Crunch Ice Cream, S+. I'd say it's

201
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:28,970
probably, I'm going to give it a high B. I like it. Warheads, again, like I just like Sweet Tarts

202
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,329
better. I don't, I don't know. They're good, but you can, you only eat one. After you eat more than

203
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:40,259
one, it's like, you're going to fucking, I feel like I'm going to throw up. I'll put it C. Kit Kats

204
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:51,000
are up high. Come around A. I'll fix it. Andy's Mints, S+, tried and true for like 500 years.

205
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,779
I may have changed my opinion on this. I don't remember what I gave this like two or three years

206
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:04,220
ago, but Andy's Mints have been tried and true, delicious, perfect. It's a perfect serving size.

207
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,140
You only need like one of them, one or two, just one or two. That's it. And it's completely

208
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:18,549
satisfying. It's a perfect combination of chocolate, mint. It's perfect. It's S. In fact, now that I

209
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:23,750
know what's right next to Sweet Tarts here, this is A. This is only for the most prestigious candy.

210
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:33,000
And Andy's are up there as, as probably, you know what? No, how dare you even get your,

211
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,559
get your hand away from there. How dare you? I like just reached it. I just got like slapped

212
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:46,259
by like mom going to get like the food. Okay. Three Musketeers. I'm going to shock a lot of you with

213
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:53,339
this one. This is a high A. The fluffy, the fluffy nougat in the middle. Oh, it's so good.

214
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,410
It's so fluffy and so like just puffy and fluffy. So yummy. So good. I love it. A plus.

215
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:16,299
It's literally air. What are these? Are these, are these, what are these gummies? What are those?

216
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:26,710
These are Swedish fish. They are Swedish fish, aren't they? F. I don't get this. I don't think

217
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:33,099
I ever will. I don't understand why people like these. Don't, I really don't like them at all.

218
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,480
They're just like kind of slimy and like chewy. I don't get it. I just, I honestly just don't get

219
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:49,049
it. I know that that's the worst take I've had, but man, these are just not good. I just, this is

220
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:58,940
not good. They're fruity. Yeah, but like I would rather just have gummy bears. The Haribo gummy,

221
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,779
are the Haribo gummy bears on here? Because those, they're just a way better version of these.

222
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:11,079
Like a hundred times better. I mean like 100 times better. It's like the same thing in my head.

223
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,890
Are they on? There they are. Yeah. Yeah. Haribo gummy bears are, wait, these are big ones. I'm

224
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:25,460
going to take these as just like the little ones. These are perfect. Yeah. These are like, hey,

225
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:34,839
these are great. Yeah. Swedish fish, you chew, you chew them up. And then after like 10 to 20

226
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:41,700
minutes, you realize that you have this like, like weird, like red, like cement paste that's aligning

227
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:54,039
all of your gums. It's like, no, I don't know. I don't like it. I don't think there's any list

228
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,809
that you'll ever see that has peeps higher than an F4D. If somebody genuinely had peeps up here,

229
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,220
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little concerned. I think I'm concerned about them. I don't think anybody

230
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,590
puts these up here. I could see how people could put them like here, but an S, I mean,

231
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:20,440
I don't know what you're talking about. How would that be possible? No, I don't think anybody puts

232
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,280
them up there. Peeps are A, yeah, but not S. If you put peeps in S tier, I don't know about that.

233
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:36,969
Dots F. Okay. All you Swedish fish Andes, what's the difference between dots and fish besides the

234
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:48,760
squished mold that is the fish mold for the candy? What's the difference? I explained. You all say

235
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,349
dots are the worst candy. Everybody knows dots is the worst candy, but Swedish fish are just like

236
00:34:53,349 --> 00:35:06,309
flattened out dots. Huh? The shape is important. Do you like dinosaur chicken nuggets more than

237
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:21,510
regular chicken nuggets? What are you talking about? Yes. These also suck. They just, it's just,

238
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,960
it takes forever. I don't like the appeal. They're better than peeps. No, they're not. Actually,

239
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,659
I'd rather eat a peep. It's just, no. Who is going to spit this shit out and eat it later?

240
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:39,989
Do you rinse it under the sink? After you suck on this thing for like three hours,

241
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:44,070
do you spit it out and like rinse it under the sink and put it in like a bag? I don't know.

242
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:56,579
Twix, that's going up here. I've had Twix before that were really like pillowy and delicious,

243
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:02,360
but I have to be honest. I've had Twix before that were kind of stale. They're like the,

244
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,190
it's just something, something's off. You know what I mean? Something's off. I've had that

245
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:16,840
experience a few times. Razzlers? Holy shit. I just, I gotta remember these being good. Sweet

246
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,659
tarts. They're on the same level. This is the candy necklace. That's up there too. Pretty like

247
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:30,809
a high B. York pep man patties. That's up there too. These are phenomenal. It's that perfect like

248
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:36,090
ice. Okay. I think of, I think of a commercial when you bite into a York pep man patty and it's like,

249
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:46,570
I hear that. I hear like a, and I think of like snow being around me. It's perfect.

250
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:57,719
Airheads are all right. They're, I don't know if I put airheads, maybe I put them like here.

251
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,420
I don't think I would rather, I'd rather have a Kit Kat than an airhead. I'm way more chocolate

252
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:11,289
oriented than I am like sweet fruit sugary kind of oriented. Look at this list with the exception

253
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:16,250
of like sweet tarts. Like most of my stuff up here is like chocolate mint, chocolate, chocolate,

254
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,880
chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. I, I, it's all right. It's all right. I like it. I don't know.

255
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,869
Why is this even on here? I don't even know what a baby Ruth tastes like. I just noticed a shit

256
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:38,539
load of peanuts. So I don't, I don't think I've had it. Uh, lifesavers are pretty good. I actually,

257
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:43,500
it's not on here, I don't think, but I prefer the like mint spear mint lifesavers over the fruity

258
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,349
ones. Can I pretend that these are the mint ones? You know, I talk about the little individually

259
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:58,170
packaged, um, mint spearmint ones. Oh, that's amazing. This is so good. The mint ones are

260
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:07,110
better. Okay. I'm just going to pretend these are the mint ones. This is okay. This is that candy

261
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:13,340
that's in that group of candy that's at every gas station that's in the bags. And it's like just all

262
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:22,119
the weird oddity like circus shit, right? There's all this, uh, the gas station has this one row of

263
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:32,460
just like with these weird bag candies. And I'm not a big fan. Circus peanuts. Yeah, circus peanuts

264
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,340
are okay. I actually kind of like eating one and going like, yeah, I remember that's what that is.

265
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,179
And then I never eat another one ever again. I don't think they just, they don't belong down

266
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:58,650
here. Hmm. Okay. Just general Hershey's bar. I mean, it's part of one of my favorite desserts

267
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:05,500
ever, which is s'mores, but by itself, like, I mean, there's, there's other things I would rather

268
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:17,210
have. A Hershey bar is fine. It's fine. But if you have Kit Kat available, that's at the same rack,

269
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:22,179
I'm going to, I'm going to get Kit Kat. If you have three musketeers and Hershey's right next

270
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:29,260
to each other, I'm never going to take the Hershey bar ever. But if you were like, Hey man,

271
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,260
do you want some chocolate? I got Hershey's. I'd be like, yeah, sure. That's fine. Sounds good.

272
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:44,409
That sounds fine. But I don't think it's probably C. Um, hot, hot tamales. This is like the hot, uh,

273
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:52,539
cinnamon candy. I'd actually probably rather eat this than candy corn. Cinnamon, like can't, no,

274
00:39:52,539 --> 00:40:06,550
thanks. S'mores are the only place Hershey's are good. Yeah. I mean, you're right, but it's one of

275
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:16,650
the reasons why it's so good, right? What are these? These, are these nerds? S. Nerds are S.

276
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,719
And again, another reason why you're probably seeing a pattern up here.

277
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:28,019
The nerds formula has never changed. It's the same formula it's been since like a

278
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:33,510
nineteen fucking hundred, since like 1830 or whatever, when these were invented, they have

279
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:41,590
never changed. They've been exactly the same and they're really good. They're gross. I like them.

280
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:50,409
I think they're good. Ring pop is fine. I probably put it over here. It's just like a lollipop,

281
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:58,019
whatever. It's just, it's a lollipop that's shaped in an interesting way. They're okay. Fireball,

282
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:04,739
again, gross cinnamon candy. That's like just hot, like cinnamon fireball kind of, you know,

283
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:15,639
thank you. Milky way is just three musketeer, but way worse, but it's not that bad. It's good.

284
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:24,090
It's just not, it doesn't even, not even come close to me. Doesn't even come close. Three

285
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,530
musketeers are just like kind of like a whipped up kind of fluffy version and it's way better.

286
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:44,599
It's pocky. Is that pocky? No, these are candy cigarettes. Okay. These are gross. These are

287
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,860
actually really gross. Have you ever eaten a candy cigarette? It kind of reminds me of like

288
00:41:52,059 --> 00:42:05,099
what plaster would taste like. I think it, you know, I know, no thanks. Pixie sticks. These are

289
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,099
all right. I'm going to put pixie sticks next to Fun Dip because they're literally the exact same

290
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:16,230
thing. There is no difference besides a stick that you lick. Nothing else is different. I would eat

291
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:26,780
it though. Some of these are going to be hard to place. I would say Starburst is S, but I don't

292
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,539
know. They kind of fell off for me. They kind of fell way down. Yeah, they fell way down for me.

293
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:39,130
I don't know why. Something about it. Something, I think, something about it. It's not really,

294
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:50,539
I don't really care. Smiders are great. I actually really enjoy these. Is it A though? It's probably

295
00:42:50,539 --> 00:43:00,440
B. These are the same to me. I would put Smarties, Candy Necklace, and Pez right next to each other.

296
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,119
They're in the same like genre of video game kind of candy. You know what I mean? They're in the same

297
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:16,980
exact genre. Where's Pez? There it is. I think Pez is probably the best, but to me they're like,

298
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:24,489
they're in the same flavor profile. They're the same like movie genre. Like this is Jason, this

299
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:29,019
is Freddy, and this is like Michael Myers. You know what I mean? It's like they're the, I'm getting

300
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:39,510
the same thing out of it. Nestle Crunch. I feel like it's been a while, but I do remember eating

301
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:46,949
it. I'm thinking it was good. I think Crackle might be better. Is Crackle on here? Can I pretend this

302
00:43:46,949 --> 00:44:02,789
is Crackle? I think Crackle actually might be better. What the fuck is Crackle? Crackle?

303
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:06,869
Is it the red wrapper? I think Crackle is better, but I think this is still good.

304
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:14,139
I don't think it's better than Kit Kat, but it's close. No it's not. Actually, you know what it is?

305
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:20,889
Actually it is. I think it is. All right, like Cookie Dough Bites. I don't think I've ever eaten

306
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:32,219
these. Fruit Gushers. Is this like a candy? Are Gushers candy or are they fruit snack? Right?

307
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:41,579
Isn't it? It's kind of a difference, isn't there? I don't like think Gushers are candy. I like them a

308
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:52,340
lot though. I don't like that you open the bag and you go take one out and like you get the like

309
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:56,579
the like streamer wall. You know what I mean? With all like the hexagons that are like

310
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:04,519
you get like the like hexagon streamer wall when you pull it out. It's all connected and shit.

311
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:20,010
I'd like to eat one at a time, but they're good. I'd rather have a gummy bear, but I actually do

312
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,420
like these. I think they're good. I know that's a gross take for a lot of people. They really

313
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,969
don't like that. People think Gushers are gross. When was the last time you had them?

314
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:39,219
Lemonheads are horrible, aren't they? But they're good. They're like they're here.

315
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:46,500
It's like this is like the same thing in my brain. Any candy where you put it in your mouth and you

316
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:56,019
go like like it's like the same thing. The same movie. It's the same like genre. It fits in the

317
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:04,869
same spot. I think they're okay. They're chewy, aren't they? These are the ones where they're

318
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,909
yellow and then when you like suck all the juice off them they turn into white like chewy little

319
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:19,320
balls, right? I got it right. After you like suck on them for a little while they turn these little

320
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:27,380
tiny white like wishy-chewy things. Soft outside, hard inside. I had it backwards. I haven't had

321
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,300
these in a while, but I do remember thinking they were pretty good. Bob Stoppers. I haven't really

322
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,840
had them. Tootsie Pops are like Hershey bars. They're fine. I would rather have something else.

323
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,860
Where are Tootsie Rolls? Did I put them up here? Where is it? There they are. I mean they're like

324
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,219
these are better than Tootsie Rolls because they're Tootsie Pops. So there's like a

325
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:55,880
there's more complex flavors going on, but I still would rather have something else.

326
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:03,619
Dolly Ranchers. These are these are up here. I'd say somewhere in A.

327
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,250
Tommy Bears are a little bit depends. What do you want out of your candy experience?

328
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:12,460
Do you want to just eat something and have it disappear and like that's it? That was delicious.

329
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,900
Move on to the next thing. Or do you want a little bit longer lasting experience? Do you want to eat

330
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,510
something that's going to last you more than one second? 10 seconds? These are the same to me.

331
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:30,340
This is just like extended delayed release tablets. These are like let's go right now.

332
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,980
Yeah, this is extended release tablets of the same thing. So I like them both.

333
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:45,690
It depends on how I feel. We got a Blow Pop, which are way better than Tootsie Pops. I can tell you

334
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:53,539
I have not had one in a long time, but I do remember them being phenomenal. Been a while.

335
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:05,769
Probably better than Gushers. Charleston Chew. What a legend. Speaking of Charleston Chew,

336
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:14,780
where the hell is it? Because that's up here. Where's Charleston Chew? Nope. I already know

337
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:23,210
what this is. It's like a gross coconut thing. Dum Dums. I'd rather have a Dum Dum than a Blow

338
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:32,809
Pop. They're just easier, quicker. Yeah, Charleston Chews are incredible in the freezer. They have to

339
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:38,789
be from the freezer though. They have to be. If a Charleston Chew is in the freezer, it's here

340
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,989
somewhere in this area. I don't know exactly where, but it's here. Life service are not that

341
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:51,849
high. This is going to need some re-combobulating here. Snickers are tried and true. It's kind of

342
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:57,349
exactly what you're looking for. Test of time. Been around for like 100 years. They've never

343
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:06,300
changed it. It's always just always good. Yeah, just always good. Especially the little ones.

344
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:15,539
Oh my god, I almost fell down. The little Snickers, the little individual little squares,

345
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:20,889
I think are better than the bars because they make sure that in the little squares,

346
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:31,219
it's the exact ratio of everything you want. It's a perfect singular bite of candy. The bar of Snickers

347
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,420
could, it's kind of, you never know what's going to be in there. You don't know what the ratio is

348
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:40,340
like. The little ones, oh yeah, you know exactly what you're getting in there. Absolutely. They're

349
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:52,119
up here. Thinking about making a change here. We'll see. M&Ms, they're all right. They're fine,

350
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:59,559
but this is just, if they're regular M&Ms, then like, whatever. Peanut butter M&Ms are up here.

351
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:09,639
Regular M&Ms, they're, they're, they're, they're reliable. They're reliable. Okay, the chocolate

352
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:16,940
inside of an M&M is better than the chocolate on the Hershey's. Like this, you just get like an

353
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,900
upgraded experience with the candy on the outside. Once you get in there, the chocolate's better,

354
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,000
it's a better chocolate. It tastes better. M&M's minis are S tier. Oh, you better believe it.

355
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:40,300
You better believe it. I think this is probably around here. Again, these fit in the same category.

356
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:45,579
Like do I want like the Reese's flavor, or do I want the M&M's flavor? One's not better than

357
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:52,869
the other for me. Razzlers get out of here. You don't belong up there. Bubble tape doesn't either.

358
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:04,300
Skittles are like, they fell off. Just like Starburst did. They're actually in the same place for

359
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:13,909
me. It's just, they kind of fell off for me. I'm not, I'm not a big fan anymore. They're almost like

360
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:20,179
too sugary. I know that like I have literally pure sugar up here, right? But something about

361
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:27,219
Skittles, they're almost like too sweet. It's like too sugary. I don't know why. Something about it.

362
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:31,059
I guess you could say this is like, this is the exact same thing, but even these like taste

363
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:38,309
different than this. It's like a different kind of sweetness. Uh, I'm gonna just, I don't, I think

364
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:46,650
these are the same, so I'm gonna put them here. Lifesavers, I'm gonna, where are lifesavers? If

365
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:55,139
they're in A, it's a mistake. Where are they? Where are they? Didn't I put other lifesavers up here?

366
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:02,460
Where'd they go? Bottom of A? All right, okay. Uh, wait, we're pretending that these are mint,

367
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:12,199
right? These are like the spirit ones. That's what we're pretending. Um, these are tropical ones. The

368
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:20,780
tropical ones are actually pretty good. I would put them somewhere here. They're okay. I would,

369
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,519
they're good. Hershey's Kisses are better than Hershey's. Again, it's, it's like, it's kind of

370
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:33,110
weird because the chocolate in a Hershey's Kiss tastes better than a Hershey bar. I don't know why

371
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:44,019
or how. I don't get it. And it's way better somehow. It is way better. Why? Why is that?

372
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:56,280
I can't give you a reason why. You just said shape doesn't matter. No, I told you that these are the

373
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,760
same thing, just different shapes. I also think they're gross. I don't think these are gross.

374
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,920
I think these are, I think chocolate's good. I think chocolate's good. I think these are gross.

375
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,659
Yeah, they could be different shapes as long as I think they taste good. That's fine.

376
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:19,639
They belong right here, right in the middle. Probably over-funned. Bazooka, what is Bazooka?

377
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:28,059
What is this doing up here? Yeah, it's called you chew up the gum for five seconds, read the comic

378
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:37,579
book and spit it out. Why was this up here? But that was, those comic books, those comics were

379
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:45,219
fire. How cool was that? A tiny little comic with like three or four, five panels. That's

380
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:53,030
fucking awesome. What a cool thing. That was really, the wrapper was a comic book. Um, excuse me.

381
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:59,030
Yeah, I was wrong. Pop rocks are fun for a second where you, you're like, oh yeah, remember these

382
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:03,909
and you do it and you go, okay, I won't eat these for like another three or four years. They're

383
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:10,780
all right. You, I don't, you can't put, okay, I know some people are going to put this in S,

384
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:17,699
but how do you put something in S that you know you're not going to eat more than like once every

385
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:26,889
two or three decades? You know what I mean? Like sure, they're really cool. It's a crazy experience.

386
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:31,369
Like it's, wow, look at the pop rocks and it's, oh my God, crunch, crunch. But if I'm only going

387
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:36,139
to do this like once every fucking five years, why can I put it up here? Like I said, why would

388
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:47,880
I put it up there? It's, it's cool, but it's not. I, I have eaten these. I mean, I ate like five of

389
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:55,940
these literally yesterday. So that's why they're up here. Um, this is a funny like experience to

390
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:02,420
have, but I don't think it's like a great candy to eat all the time. These are the wax bottles.

391
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:09,429
Again, same deal. You're going to remember that the wax bottles exist. You're going to go, oh dude,

392
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:18,059
oh my God. Whoa. Oh yeah. Do you remember? Do you remember that? And then you go, both going to go,

393
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:22,460
okay, we're not doing that for another decade. We're not doing that again. We're not doing that

394
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:27,260
ever again. Like we're going to do it once and then forget it exists for like another five years

395
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:33,590
till we remember to do it again. They belong in the same place and they're somehow better than

396
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:42,619
Starburst and Skittles, but that experience is cooler than, yeah. Yep. I think so. Almond Joy.

397
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:53,849
Mm. I really don't, I really don't like these. I don't like them. I think they're better. These

398
00:55:53,849 --> 00:56:00,889
are probably better than, yeah, than all this fucking dog shit. You know, it's tough to like

399
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:08,329
do these. Somebody said earlier, like you're going to, you're ruining sponsorship opportunities.

400
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:12,969
If like Twizzlers for any reason ever, and I'm not saying this is ever going to happen,

401
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:17,610
but if any of these companies were ever like, Hey man, we should, you want to like work together?

402
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,179
And all that was here. Wow. These are all dog shit. These are dog shit. You know what I mean?

403
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:39,210
Like I gotta be careful. These are not weighted to my palate moment. They're all one company.

404
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:48,650
Don't worry. That's true. True. True. That's true. All right. Laffy Taffy is actually,

405
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:55,079
holy shit. This is the pink Laffy Taffy. I'm trying to remember what it tastes like. It's like a

406
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:01,929
creamy, weird, like strawberry fake flavoring. And it's delicious. Isn't it? It's like fantastic.

407
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:22,920
I like know what this tastes like. Yeah. Hold on. I'm getting it. Hey. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's,

408
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:31,659
that's probably, oh, that's up here. I think so. Yeah. These are really good. I just haven't

409
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:36,099
had one in a while. Where's uh, like just Saltwater Taffy. That belongs up here in S.

410
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:44,010
These things are fine. They're, you eat the paper half the time. Whatever. No. Any candy where you

411
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:49,130
go like this. No, it's like, it's fine. It's, but I don't think it's, I don't, I don't want it all

412
00:57:49,130 --> 00:58:01,820
the time. Uh, jelly beans. I mean, toasted marshmallow jelly beans are up here, but the

413
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:08,699
fact that they kept popcorn in for this long. I mean, they, well, you go down here like the,

414
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:16,150
just the fact that these, these people have put popcorn still in here this many years later.

415
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:24,099
What are you thinking? Like, what are you thinking? Popcorn is the best flavor. What are you thinking?

416
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:35,960
Popcorn's the best flavor. What are, what drugs I've seeped into you. Popcorn is not the best

417
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:45,139
flavor. Popcorn tastes like fucking eggs. The popcorn jelly bean tastes like eggs. No, I will,

418
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:55,539
I'm going to die on this hill. Toasted marshmallow is way up here and watermelon. So you know what,

419
00:58:55,539 --> 00:59:01,579
besides like the egg flavored one, I would probably enjoy this more than Fondue or Lemonheads.

420
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:15,780
I think it's a solid B. Toasted marshmallow and sucks ass. That's like, they're literally the only

421
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:25,559
reason to get it. That's why you buy the jelly beans. What are you on about? What are you talking

422
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,130
about? I can't believe somebody's saying that right now. That's crazy to me. Uh, Whoppers kind

423
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:36,519
of tastes like acid. Uh, Whoppers are good, but they taste like they're fucking something's wrong

424
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:46,940
with like the something was wrong in the production. But they do have a, they have a very interesting

425
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:52,920
flavor. And if you're really into it, there's been times where I've looked at the Whoppers kind of

426
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,739
at the movie theater counter or whatever and been like, you know what, go, let's do it. Let's get it.

427
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:05,739
Let's go for it. And I'm like, oh yeah, these are fine. But they do, they kind of have that weird

428
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:11,559
like acidic fucking taste. Like there's something, like there was way too much of some ingredient

429
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:16,659
that you wanted to remove. But I, I think that they're fine. I would, I think they're solid.

430
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:25,139
But they, they see. I see. In fact, like these are like gimmick fucking things. They should be down

431
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:35,099
here. They're fine. They taste fine, but they're gimmicks. This is a gimmick. Who's going to be

432
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,110
able to do this at the office? You know what I mean? Who's, this is a gimmick. You're not,

433
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:50,179
you can't do that at the office. Like these down here, one, two, three, four, five, you can't do

434
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:56,059
this at the office. But like the guy in the next door and like the office next door, you're going

435
01:00:56,059 --> 01:01:02,869
to do like pop rocks. And you look over, you peek over like the side and he's like, you can't do

436
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:19,079
that at the office. Why not? It's not for adults. I know. But I'm just saying you can't do that

437
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:25,480
at the office. We already know where Skittles are. We're going to put them both here.

438
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:37,269
Milk Duds. Oh, Milk Duds are bad. But why are these in the same space? Why are these

439
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:45,780
occupying the same part of my brain? They're like chewy and kind of hard, right? Oh, I know Milk

440
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:51,110
Duds. Milk Duds are the ones that are unbelievably delicious. The chocolate, the like candy chocolate

441
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:55,590
coating on the outside is fucking so good. It's like chewy and oh, it's so yummy. And then you

442
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:04,760
spit it out when it gets to like the weird like gum under the desk consistency. Right. Okay. I mean,

443
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,960
these are like A plus in flavor. But when they get to that point, they go all the way down here.

444
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:14,360
I think I'd probably rather have a whopper. The flavor is phenomenal, though. It really is.

445
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:28,949
The flavor is phenomenal. What are these dots? These are the cousin of dots. What are these

446
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:36,860
called? Like dinkels or something? What are these called? What are these gumdrops? Oh,

447
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:44,969
no, they're they're like we're dots in the same place for me. Okay, hold on.

448
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:52,380
Let me guess. Let me guess. Is it right? He sees Andy's nerds. Three musketeers. Dork pep and

449
01:02:52,380 --> 01:03:05,139
patties. Snickers. Hearts. I'm gonna move this. I'm gonna move this. Yeah, I think. Wait. Yeah.

450
01:03:05,139 --> 01:03:10,309
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's move this a little bit here. Remember these are mint. These

451
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:18,500
are mint. This is I remember this being so good. These are fine. Milky Way. Yeah, that's fine.

452
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:23,320
Put this up a little higher. Way higher, actually. Actually, you know what? Fuck that.

453
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:29,849
Oh, fuck that. Yeah, I'd rather have a youth bar. Maybe not more than a gummy bear.

454
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:45,239
Maybe not. Stupid fucking idiot. Idiot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think that's fine. I still think he's an

455
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,039
alien for putting Pocky in trash tier. Actually, Pocky would be up here for me now. I've had a

456
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:56,730
few flavors that I actually really liked. There's like a mint chocolate Pocky that is up here.

457
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:06,500
I don't really like any of the other ones. Here's my old list. Okay. Pocky was on there twice.

458
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:16,230
All right. Let's get my old list. I think I'm happy with this one. What have we got?

459
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:35,820
All right. What's going on here? Who puts Mr. Goodbar in S tier? Why is Mr. Goodbar in S tier?

460
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:45,929
Mr. Goodbar? What the fuck am I talking about? Why is Mr. Goodbar on here twice? It's on here

461
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:57,659
two times. I don't get it. You were pretending it was something else. Does it remember what it was

462
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:05,110
supposed to be? Why would you ever put Mr. Goodbar in S tier? It's good, but not S tier.

463
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:20,230
Oh, this is an absolutely brainless take. Gummy bears are in D. Cadbury eggs are in D. M&M's are

464
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:33,530
in F. What am I talking about? Guys, what am I on about? Is Swedish fish down at F? It better be.

465
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:42,219
Sweet tarts? All right. Hold on. Let's shrink this down a little. Yeah. All right. Sweet tarts are

466
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:57,530
fine. Broly is in trash tier. And I would put it there again. I would put it down here again.

467
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:04,789
Everyone talking about how I have like a palette of a 10-year-old and yet I'm getting all this

468
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:21,780
flack for trolley gummy worms being down in like D. Excuse me? Gummy worms? No. Broly is S. No,

469
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:26,579
it's not. It's a gummy worm. Gummy worms are like fucking F. They're like D. I don't like them.

470
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:39,530
They're down here with like Swedish fucking fish. Wait. Hold on. I'll be fair. I'll be fair. Relax.

471
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:45,099
Relax. I'll be fair. I've never had a trolley before ever in my life.

472
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:48,949
It's just gummy worms are for kids, but I just didn't ever, I never bought them.

473
01:06:49,510 --> 01:07:02,949
Eat a trolley on stream. Gummy worms were like, oh, ew. He's got a worm in his mouth that's for

474
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:15,530
children. I never bought them. Everything that I have besides nerds is an adult beverage of candies.

475
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:21,610
Okay. It's an adult beverage of candies. Reese's is like the whiskey. No. Reese's is, yeah. Reese's

476
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:27,780
is like the whiskey. Andy's is like the, like peppermint schnapps. Free Musketeers is like a

477
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:34,179
really good fucking wine. York peppermint patty. These are, these are, these are like adult beverages.

478
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:44,059
Snickers bar. Oh, that's like, these are, these are like aged to perfection. Everyone making fun

479
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:49,099
of my, my 10 year old palette and saying, where's trolley? Where's the gummy worms?

480
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:57,269
Bubble tape. It's six feet of bubble gum for adults, not kids. I remember the commercial.

481
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:05,820
Six feet of bubble gum for you, not kids. I saw it a million times. It was on TV all the time.

482
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:10,889
You're already in mine. Okay. I've never had a trolley. I'll leave the trolley on stream

483
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:20,630
and I'll change my opinion if it's good. Gummy worms are for men. What? It's not for men? No,

484
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:38,819
it's not. Why? How's a gummy worm for men? Oh, it's a man sized gummy worm. Gummy worms are for men.

485
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:45,380
Why are you putting gummy worms in the same category as, as like a fucking like brisket sandwich?

486
01:08:51,739 --> 01:09:00,310
Executives eat trolley. Really? At the office? Really? At the, at the office?

487
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:08,439
Trolley gummy worms coming out at the office? Really? No, it is coming out. Andy's mints. Andy's

488
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:16,600
mints. York peppermint patties. Son, would you like a Snickers? Son, how about a three musketeers?

489
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,100
That's coming out of the board meeting. Nobody at the board meeting is, unless it's like one of

490
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,739
those like 90s comedy movies where like the kind of weird funny guy got on the board of directors

491
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:30,619
and like comes to the office in like a, like a sweatshirt and like glasses and eats gummy worms.

492
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:40,859
All right. This is not a 90s comedy movie. We're executives and we eat Andy's mints.

493
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:53,239
CEOs eat trolley. Oh no, they do not. You're a boring adult. Okay, here we go. I will buy a

494
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:59,770
bag of trolley and I'll eat them on stream. Is there a certain color of trolley that I need to eat

495
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,930
first? Or is it one of those cases where like, no dude, skip all the green ones and yeah, those

496
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:10,859
are the gross ones. Which, what, which is the one I need to eat? Blue? Make this, you better make

497
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:20,039
this accurate because you're only getting one chance. Sour trolley? Blue sour trolley. The blue

498
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:25,479
and pink blue and sour trolley. Blue and blue and pink trolley. Sour. Blue and pink sour trolley.

499
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:38,199
Okay. All right. Any, any of the blue ones, any of the red ones. Pink. Sour. Okay. Sure. I'm going to

500
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:45,260
eat a blue sour trolley on stream tomorrow. Tomorrow. We'll do it tomorrow. Any other candies

501
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:53,239
that I have to have to be a fucking adult? Which ones? I'll give you my real opinion. Tomorrow.

502
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:06,180
Can you eat, can you eat a review of Papa John's pizza? I'm not going to eat a fucking trolley and

503
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:12,810
then a Papa John's pizza tomorrow. Why would I do that? Oh, hey dude, now that you're trying candy,

504
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:31,020
eat a whole Papa John's pepperoni pizza and give us what you thought. Okay. How about this? No,

505
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,859
that's, I don't think I can get that by tomorrow. Should I like go up against my own bullshit and

506
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:42,819
eat all the things that are in like D, like C and D? Should we do like a face your bullshit stream

507
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:48,229
where like I eat all these things that I have in a bad category and tell you how I really feel?

508
01:11:52,619 --> 01:12:04,470
And you have to eat them in a suit. Toblerone is S plus. It's not, it can't even fit on this list.

509
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:09,109
Toblerone is like stratosphere. It's the best candy in the world, but it's just not on here.

510
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:14,010
It's not fair. It's not fair for Toblerone to be on here. All right. How about this? Let's,

511
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:18,489
okay. This is what we're going to do. We're going to do a face the bullshit stream.

512
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:33,479
Can I do it tomorrow? Tomorrow. Okay. Can I, can you give me a day to prepare? I want to make sure

513
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:39,720
I can like get a bunch of these. I'll do a face the bullshit stream. Let me, give me a little,

514
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:47,770
give me a day or two to prepare this. Thursday. I think I can get most of these by Thursday.

515
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:58,949
I don't think I can get it by tomorrow. I'll wear a suit and it will, it'll be called face the

516
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:04,840
bullshit stream. I'm talking like all the, all like the F tier shit that I've told you about.

517
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,180
We're talking bread? Like I'm going to get wheat bread. Like you know what, what we should do?

518
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:13,260
Let me, I'm going to go through these and figure out all the, all the things that I fucking said

519
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:20,359
it would do a gross. You're going to buy every single candy at the store in a suit.

520
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:28,760
Did they make little versions of this shit? I don't want to like eat one and then like not want it.

521
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:37,770
You need a popcorn jelly bean. Oh fuck. You can get 95% of these at like Walmart or a gas station.

522
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:52,659
Okay. All right. All right. We'll, we'll make this work. So I'm, tomorrow I'm going to scour the world

523
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:57,220
for all these things that I said that I hate or think is gross or think like I, I'm so high and

524
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:03,449
mighty on and I will give you my real honest opinions on them. I will not fuck around.

525
01:14:03,449 --> 01:14:07,260
I'm going to, and I'm going to do it in a suit. It's going to be like a fucking telephone on the

526
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:24,460
desk. I'm going to have like an executive table. All I ask is that you don't fuck around. All right.

527
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:30,359
I'll pull up all, I get, I'll figure it out. But yeah, we'll, we'll open up. If you have any

528
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:35,909
recommendations, by the way, we have the recommended channel in discord. Maybe I can work with maybe the

529
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:42,970
mods. We'll, we'll get like a good list of like a bunch of stuff. This is going to be the worst

530
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:58,840
stream of the year with candlelight. What if he pukes? What if I puke on camera? Can I puke?

531
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:11,210
Yeah. It's going to be called face the bullshit and a top hat with candles. All right. Let me

532
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:22,619
just make sure I can even get all this gross stuff. Okay. I'll see you. I'll see you guys on Thursday.

533
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:32,229
Thursday. We're going to start early on Thursday, not four o'clock. We're going to start Thursday,

534
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:39,930
probably around like two. You said tomorrow. I got to go. Okay. I don't think I can find

535
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:47,609
some of these things on the chips list guys. I'm going to have to go to like fucking five

536
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:52,939
Walmarts. That's not going to happen tomorrow. All the, okay. If he wants to get the F's from

537
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:59,399
his chip list, I'll do them all. All my tier lists. Maybe besides the fast food ones. Cause

538
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:02,649
that I don't want to like, all right. Here's what I don't want to do. I don't want to like

539
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:07,350
buy a bunch of food and like waste a bunch of food. Right. That'll be for like a different day.

540
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:12,300
And maybe we're talking like shelf stable stuff because even if I don't like it, I can like

541
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,859
roll it up and like eat it over the course of a year. So I, I'm not going to buy like

542
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:21,899
fucking 30 pieces of fast food and take 10 bites of everything and then throw it all away. I'm

543
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:31,800
not going to do that. So we'll see. I'll do it on Thursday. Do it on Friday. I can't do it on

544
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:38,699
Friday. Cause I need to get like all these candies. I need to get all those chips. I need to get all

545
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:51,000
the sodas and hey, where's the, where's the Pepsi nitro? Where's Pepsi nitro? Where's Pepsi nitro?

546
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:56,600
Where the fuck is it? I keep seeing commercials for it. Where is it? Where is it? They keep showing

547
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:08,710
it to me. Where is it? It's bad. I want to try it. I keep seeing it on like television and shit.

548
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:18,920
And I'm like, I want it. I want to try it. It's so good. It actually looked good. All right.

549
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:23,079
Those of you that want to follow the sort of what's going to happen here,

550
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:30,359
all the F tier candies and like maybe some of the D tier candies, all the F tier sodas,

551
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:35,260
all the F tier chips. I'm going to try to get as many of them as I can. Here we go. And I'm

552
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:42,579
going to give you, I'm going to give a rating out of 10. That's it. I'll see you. I'll see you

553
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:51,880

554
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,010
That's why it's going to take more than like a day. I have to go to like a bunch. I have to like,

555
01:17:56,569 --> 01:18:02,170
I don't think they have all this stuff in one place. Who the fuck has candy corn right now?

556
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:07,689
Or candy cigarettes? I don't know. Are these even legal anymore? Are these, these are illegal?

557
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:13,539
Aren't they? I don't think I can buy these. We're going to get these. We're supposed to get that.

558
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:24,329
Cookie dough bites. Guys, they don't even sell this. You have to go to Spencer's Gifts.

559
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:34,859
Spencer's. Just go to a movie theater. Oh my God. I'm going to go to a movie theater and just

562
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:48,140

Bye. Bye, man. Enjoy Spider-Man. That movie sucked. See you later. It did, I'm kidding.

567
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:38,140
They're saying get some, get what you can reasonably get. Cereal list too. Yep. I have so much

568
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:43,180
bullshit. I'm going to have a pantry full of shit. I'm never going to have to buy a cereal ever. But

569
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:50,699
what if I don't like it? I'm going to have to like eat like gross cereal. I mean, I'm going to eat all

570
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:55,899
this stuff because it's going to be, I don't want to just waste a bunch of food. So if I buy, for

571
01:19:55,899 --> 01:20:03,750
instance, um, what is down here at the very bottom? Like multi-grain Cheerios. Oh, I don't want to eat

572
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:19,130
those, but I don't want to eat multi-grain Cheerios. Could you donate it? Okay. If I don't get through

573
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:26,760
everything and yeah, but I mean, I'm going to be opening most of this stuff. I'm going to have to

574
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:37,109
eat it. So if I, if I can track down the Sour Patch Kids cereal, I'm going to have to open the bag and

575
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:42,840
eat it. I can't like, I'm not going to, I'm going to have to eventually over the course of like a year

576
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:49,529
eat that Sour Patch Kids cereal. They're a single serving box. Yeah. I'll make sure to get the small

577
01:20:49,529 --> 01:21:12,569
ones. All right. So I'll see you on Thursday for Face the Bullshit 2 p.m. Might start earlier.
