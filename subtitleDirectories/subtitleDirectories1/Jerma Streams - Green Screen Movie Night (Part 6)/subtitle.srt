1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:10,390
Good morning. What? Good afternoon is what I meant to say. How are you? Good afternoon or evening,

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:25,739
wherever you are in the world, how are you? Morning makes no sense. Today, we have an interesting

3
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:42,170
stream today. I decided to get Freddy Fish 3 and a search for the kelp diamond. Now this is green

4
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:49,530
screen movie night. Let's, I'm gonna wait because we need people to trickle in here. People have been

5
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,810
waiting for this for a while. So I want to make sure that I don't just go. Let's go. Hurry up.

6
00:00:53,369 --> 00:01:02,280
Hopefully you have some something to snack on. Maybe I've heard some of you have made some popcorn.

7
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:13,739
Pretty cool. Maybe you've got a beverage. I've got a green tea. I was thinking about having a little

8
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:20,359
bit of alcohol tonight, but I think I might have to not do that because I'm sick. Still having

9
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:27,700
problems. Probably a bad idea. I thought about maybe just drinking like a couple of beers.

10
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,299
But it's probably not a good idea for how I am now. And how I am now, I'm still coughing. I'm

11
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,900
still having issues and you probably hear it from time to time, but I'm, I've been pretty good at

12
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,260
muting and muting the sneezes and shit too. So dude, come on. Aren't you like 20? I don't know why

13
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:59,500
anybody ever thinks this. No. Aren't you, aren't you 20? Okay. So here's what happened tonight.

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,900
If you don't know how good you're not, we've been hyping this up for like a month now.

15
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,500
This is green screen movie night. Over the course of the last two or three weeks,

16
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:18,340
we have had people submit videos using footage from the last three and a half to four years of

17
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,939
green screen footage. We recently, last month, or not last month, maybe three weeks ago, four weeks

18
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:29,699
ago, just about under a month, went in front of the green screen again. I did a bunch of weird shit

19
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:38,490
and there were almost a thousand submissions, almost 1000 submissions came through.

20
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,180
And I wanted to make a point of this because we, I got, I have to say this, right?

21
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,500
If your video is not shown, don't be discouraged. It's just, there was a lot to go through.

22
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,020
All the videos were vetted and put in, and we're going to do maybe two nights,

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,060
might be able to do three nights. So even if you don't see your video tonight,

24
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,870
that doesn't mean it was a bad video, right? That means that you might show it. It probably

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,030
will show up during an encore night, which I'm not even going to call it an encore night because

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,669
there are so many, so there are so many good submissions that we're just going to do this

27
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:24,250
twice. There's no way we're only going to do this once. It's physically impossible. Out of the,

28
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:34,840
I think, what were the total amount of submissions? Submissions? Submissions. Yeah. 800? 900? We'll,

29
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,500
we'll probably show at least a third of these or if not more, but I can't show them all, right?

30
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,099
Even if it's good, even if it's, it's going to be hard to show all of these.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,120
So if you watch this tonight and you go, where the fuck is my video?

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,210
Um, don't because it could show up on the next one. And if it doesn't show up on the next one,

33
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,699
then don't be discouraged, please. It was just a lot to go through. And we had to just select

34
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,900
ones based on how much effort went into this one or who thought, all the mods and community leaders,

35
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,110
did they think this one was funny? Cause I didn't, I haven't seen any of these. I have not seen a

36
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,310
single one of these. That's a lie. I'm lying to you right now. I've seen probably four,

37
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:33,209
but that's what I need to say. That's what I need to say. I'm a liar. Well, I'm very excited. We have

38
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:40,620
how many videos are there? Let's see. Uh, there are, there are one, there are almost 200 videos

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,139
as of right now, still cleaning the playlist up a little bit. The 198 videos on this playlist.

40
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you fucking kidding me? I hopefully can get through this in the next four to five hours.

41
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,670
So we'll find out. Yeah. The consideration for videos that we're going to be shown were how

42
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,639
much will chat like this? How much will I like this? I'm, I'm hyping this up. We're hyping this

43
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:20,949
up. I'm not just going to go guys. 300 million people have been waiting for this stream.

44
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:33,060
Divide that by like a thousand or 2000 or whatever, or 10,000. I'm it's been a long time since we've

45
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,949
watched any of these. Are you guys ready? It's been about the, I should wait for about 10 minutes.

46
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,930
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let me wait for 10 minutes. Did I tweet?

47
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:58,519
Did I tweet? I did. Right. Just making sure I tweeted. Oh yeah, I did. Oh yeah. Hey, hey,

48
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:07,319
you guys, you guys ready to laugh? You guys ready to laugh it up? Let's go, go, go, go, go.

49
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:22,660
All right. All right. Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, wait.

50
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,180
Sorry. Also the audio on these, we did make a rule where you couldn't have abrupt loud sounds,

51
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,339
but none of this stuff is equalized. So just be aware that some stuff might, some videos might be

52
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:42,500
way louder than others. Some videos might be at a certain decibel level. I have a limiter that I

53
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,379
can turn on. So if it gets to be too crazy, then we'll, I'll turn it on, but I don't think I'm going

54
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:59,079
to need to as of right now. Okay. We're just going in full blast. Yeah. So it's probably going to be

55
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:06,379
loud. Some of these and some have jump scares, by the way. Some of these have, they do. All right.

56
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,620
Some of them have jump scares. Okay. Thanks for the warning. Cause I, some of them have jump

57
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,060
scares. Be ready for jump scares too. All right. I'm not waiting anymore. Adjust your volume as,

58
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:28,550
as you see fit because it's going to, it's going to get loud here. Here we go. It's w we, we are T

59
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,910
minus two minutes away. Also be ready to dance too. Be ready to dance is what I've been told.

60
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:43,399
Remember, why do you hate EU fans? I wanted to like drink like three drinks of vodka tonight

61
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,920
to this stream. And I'm not drinking at fucking 10 o'clock in the morning. Okay.

62
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,910
But I might have to have to cancel my drinking tonight. We'll see. After like an hour,

63
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:01,829
we'll see how I feel. Refresh. Yeah. I did. I got it. You're a coward. No, I'm ill.

64
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:17,930
I'm physically ill. That did sound fake and it may have been. Okay. That was very loud.

65
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:27,560
That was a good test. That's a good test of the, of the, uh, the sound system. I'm so excited.

66
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:39,559
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it. I know, I know, I know, I don't, don't, don't,

67
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,320
whatever it is. I, I'm not waiting anymore. We're almost at the 10 minute mark and everyone's

68
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,039
already here. Everybody's here. Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Ladies and gentlemen,

69
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:56,860
welcome to green screen movie night. The final of maybe two or three green screen movie nights.

70
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:06,980
Got to do it in a trilogy. That's how it works here. Here we go. I'm ready. Are you ready?

71
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:22,679
Oh my goodness. Begin. Hi. Oh, here are your friends. Oh, it's Otto.

72
00:09:24,860 --> 00:10:06,980
Well, this is the fucking. Okay. I'm going to shut up. Hey, Dr. Spikes. It is awesome. Oh,

73
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:17,690
all right. Cool. That was cute. From all of us, banana bros. All right. That was cute.

74
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:52,169
That's a good intro. Let's move. The middle one's not even a twerk.

75
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:43,379
37 years old. I don't join. That was an original song, by the way, if you were curious,

76
00:11:43,379 --> 00:12:22,149
it's called German's new friend. Oh shit. Please clap. Hi.

77
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,549
Don't splash me. Don't splash me. You can't splash here. It says it on the sign.

78
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:55,080
We walked in. Don't splash people. That was it. That was 3D animated. Hold on a second.

79
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:05,450
That was. Hold on. This was 3D animated. It's probably took like a week to render.

80
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,220
Don't splash me. Don't splash me. I love it here. It says it on the sign.

81
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:24,120
Don't splash people. All right. What's coming up next? That was so good.

82
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:57,320
German remix 10, part one, unlisted. Oh shit. The same person made them before, right?

83
00:14:13,320 --> 00:15:37,299
Come on. Oh shit. I get it. This is awesome. Damn. Holy shit.

84
00:15:54,539 --> 00:17:14,150
One, two, three, go. Oh Jesus. Holy shit. That was a pogchamp right there. Wow. Wow. That was sick.

85
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,460
We'll give the playlist at the end of the stream and everything too, so don't worry.

86
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,980
Wow. Pretty good start. Pretty good start so far. No cam. I'm not going to put a cam on,

87
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,059
by the way. People have asked for it. I don't want to mess with the integrity of the video files.

88
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,779
I think it's better that way. So we can get engrossed. You don't have to look at my

89
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:45,690
fucking ugly mug in the corner. I might pop in from time to time. You never know. By the way,

90
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:57,779
people are like, oh wow. Hooray. Good. That's it. There's 192 more videos. So sit down and strap in.

91
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:19,160
The sus experience. Don't let them see you. Find the exit. Don't die. Status hidden. This is a

92
00:18:19,160 --> 00:19:08,329
whole game. Warning. Jumpscare coming. Heartbeat.

93
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:58,460
The soft part. I want to see the soft part again. Nice job. Oh, no shit. What? Dr. Clay.

94
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:07,990
No shit. Dr. Clay's a mod here. You don't know. This part is so dumb. I need to see this again.

95
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:30,599
The best part about that is when the gas hits. That's when the bicycle falls apart. That's

96
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:37,160
perfect. Well done. Well done. Well done. Oh, my God. That was funny. All right. Let's keep

97
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,890
moving. We don't stop. We got to keep going. No stopping. Be careful. Things could be loud.

98
00:21:42,890 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm just warning you. The battle of Home Depot 2. Oh, God. What? Sire, get down.

99
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:24,009
I've been a Jedi agent the whole time. Get down, Sire. I have the power of God and anime on my side.

100
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:31,910
Oh, God. It's fucking Spider-Man. Why would Spider-Man be in this game?

101
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:53,240
Let's go. You shall not pass. Yeah, that's right. Gandalf. Always pick Gandalf.

102
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:17,740
Oh, my God. Oh, shoot. It was a Boomerang. Boomerang mode. Don't use that one.

103
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,970
Ow. No. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

104
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,680
Now, I think, honestly, look, I'm going to work. I'm on the way to work right now.

105
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:53,319
We can we can talk this later, but I want you to buy any company that that makes makes

106
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,410
what the hell are they called? Tick-tock. You buy tick-tock. How do you buy that?

107
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:24,839
I can't. What? How did you do this? Seize towers. Topple them.

108
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:45,130
Wait a second. Wait a second. I I just hold on this. There was a lot to there was a lot to take

109
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:52,569
in on this one. This was it was a lot to take in here. This is my favorite part of the whole thing

110
00:24:53,829 --> 00:25:01,460
is the fact that you put it in. Did you put a cheat code in to get a lightsaber or is it to

111
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:09,049
unlock? Oh, it's to unlock the jester. OK, sorry. I get down. I've been a Jedi agent the whole time.

112
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:16,650
God, that's so fucking dumb. That's so funny. Brilliant. All right. Moving on to the first of,

113
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:33,130
I would say, probably at least 20 Super Mario drug PSAs. That was amazing. My voice is going to be

114
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:47,079
gone. I'll deal with you later. Oh, boys and girls, it's a me, Mario. Let me tell you something.

115
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:55,640
If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no. You say, Luigi, try to drink

116
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:03,579
and do drugs one time. And I said, no. And he said, Mario. And I said, no, you should never take any

117
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:14,329
drugs. Never. Mario wouldn't. Luigi wouldn't. Toad. Maybe. What the fuck? Don't do drugs.

118
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:22,660
If you do drugs, you'll end up like King Bowser. Boys and girls, don't do drugs. You don't have to

119
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,579
do them. Don't feel pressured to take drugs or drink. If anyone ever pressures you, tell them,

120
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:32,579
Mario said, so long, King Bowser, and they will leave you alone.

121
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:44,569
This is called Germstraction Do's How Bees Make Honey. This is Crash Box.

122
00:26:44,569 --> 00:27:00,069
Distraction with your anchor person, Dora Smarmy. Good evening. I'm Dora Smarmy,

123
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:05,190
and welcome to Distraction News, where we give you the news and then ask you questions about

124
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,789
what we've just reported. So make sure you're not distracted. Pay attention. Now for our top story

125
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:18,230
today, how bees make honey. The female worker bee flies from the hive to a flower. When she arrives,

126
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:24,230
she climbs in and using her hollow straw-like tongue, she drinks the nectar. The nectar enters

127
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:30,630
the bee's crop or honey stump. She mixes it with important proteins called enzymes, which keep the

128
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,470
nectar fresh. When she is fully loaded with nectar, she returns to the hive where she pours out the

129
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:43,589
enzyme-rich nectar into a small waxed cell. We call these wax cells the honeycomb. Because the

130
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:49,430
hives are warm, a constant 95 degrees Fahrenheit, the water heats up in the nectar and evaporates.

131
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:55,750
What we're left with is sweet honey. Okay, now let's see how well you were able to remember the

132
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,269
facts and be sure to count how many you got right. Where does the worker bee get the nectar? From a

133
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:09,109
flower, the fridge, or rotten fruit? I don't know. The answer is a flower. In the honey stomach,

134
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:16,170
the nectar is mixed with proteins called bee juice, honey mix, or enzymes. The answer is

135
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:30,420
enzymes. And finally, bees wax, pollen, or water. The answer is water. So how did you do? Honey was

136
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:36,819
a pretty sticky topic, eh? Okay, so I'm a cardboard anchor and not a cardboard comedian. So sue me.

137
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,940
Well, that's all the time we have for today. But remember, don't ever let anything distract you

138
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:49,940
from watching distraction news. So long. This has been distraction news with your favorite

139
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,059
cardboard anchor person, Toro Smurmy.

140
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:14,329
Oh no, it's another Mario drug PSA. Hold on, hold on, we gotta go back. Oh my goodness,

141
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:21,539
this man got his son stolen by Super Mario. Okay, okay, let's check it out.

142
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:44,579
Bingo. This is in, look at how huge this is. Like, what is even in this?

143
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,640
What's that? No, no. You're doing a great job out there, son.

144
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,980
Don't climb that. Don't get down from there. Don't climb that. How do you mind? Don't climb that.

145
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,779
He's a maniac, I know, right? He's my son, right? Yeah, I know. You want, you ready for a dog?

146
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:32,380
Oh, I come into your house. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.

147
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,859
You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it.

148
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:47,690
I'm not leaving. No, I think I deserve to win. What? It was a creepy mushroom risotto and you

149
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:56,619
don't have a fucking palate to save your life, you fucking idiot. Oh no. Sorry, I kept you all

150
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:07,660
waiting. They'd be running circles around you, by the way. Oh, what a terrible. Stop sign, stop

151
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:42,140
sign, stop sign. I'm going to use your wand. I might as well suggest you use it. No bluffing

152
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:49,670
this time, Harry. No bluffing. Last final touch, I swear I will not touch it again. Oh, beautiful.

153
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,890
Oh, that looks good, don't you think? You don't like, you didn't like my arm?

154
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:09,430
It's masterpiece, no? No? It's masterpiece, no? You know nothing about art.

155
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:27,480
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Let me get a little closer. They're going to hear literally every

156
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,839
single one of these words. That one was crazy. That one was amazing too.

157
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:41,210
Oh, okay, we got Jerma attempts the Mario 64 any percent 16 star, but I can't wait for this one.

158
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:51,819
They're going to hear literally every single one of these burps. No, toast goes in the toaster.

159
00:32:51,819 --> 00:33:00,539
Is that in the same thing? Is that in that? All right, let's get some walking.

160
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:35,859
Where is he?

161
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,500
Oh, mama me.

162
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:50,360
I'm running out of time. I saw you laughing in the corner. What's wrong? What's wrong with me?

163
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:17,400
When did I put that fucking wig on? I don't even remember that. Honest to God.

164
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
Mario? What?

165
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:54,500
Hold on, I need a moment. They're going to hear literally every single one of these burps.

166
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:02,230
I'm so confused. What's with the hair? Who is it? My mind from this one. What is this?

167
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:14,019
Why? What is this from? Why did I think this was a good idea from Mario? It was his real hair.

168
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,570
Oh, you were being a farmer. Oh, because of the overalls. Right, right, right.

169
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:29,030
Right, so you just, okay, that's really funny. This is, man, that's a fucking 10 out of 10s.

170
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:37,400
Honest to God. God, that was so funny. All right, let's keep going. Here we go.

171
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,599
Get it. What is it on my back? What's on my back, dude? Get it. Just get it. I'll stand still.

172
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,789
Just hit it with that. I'll hit it with a baseball bat. I don't care. All right, you cartoon monster.

173
00:37:46,940 --> 00:38:15,590
Ah, hmm, hmm, uh-uh, uh-uh. That hurts a little. That's supposed to feel like that.

174
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:25,880
It feels, my whole face hurts. My face is burning. That burns a lot. What the? What is that?

175
00:38:25,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Oh, my God. That was fucking wonderful. Jerma makes his musical debut. It's so scary.

176
00:39:42,820 --> 00:40:07,449
It's so unhinged. No, sit down. Sit down. Don't reach that. All right, okay, you gotta stand.

177
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:17,079
Thank you. Wow. Thank you. You don't have to stand. Sit down. Sit down. No, sit down. All right. Okay,

178
00:40:17,079 --> 00:41:22,119
thank you. Thank you. I'm probably so red. I'm like hot. That was awesome. Good work.

179
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:34,139
New cowboy western ass of steel. You look like you just got out of jail. What the hell is this?

180
00:41:34,139 --> 00:42:21,460
Should have been more careful. You're welcome. You're very welcome. But okay, my very part of

181
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:26,679
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, spoilers. What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

182
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,449
what happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What'd I do? What'd I do? What'd I do?

183
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:37,420
Okay, we're good. My favorite part about this one is me going to pick up the gun.

184
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:52,889
This is the best part of the whole thing. What the fuck are you doing? Turn around. Let's go.

185
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:33,960
You're aware. What? Episode one. Here it comes.

186
00:44:32,489 --> 00:45:03,400
I can't believe that happened. Oh, God. How did you pitch it up?

187
00:45:03,880 --> 00:46:30,329
I'm going to put you in a meat grinder. Got him. Let's see where it goes from here. But yeah,

188
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:36,139
thanks again for watching. See you all next time. Take care everybody. That was cute.

189
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:45,340
This is German Lord of the Rings. You are not passing anytime soon buster.

190
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,400
You shall not pass.

191
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:15,349
Why did you turn off all the audio? All the audio turns off.

192
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,659
Oh, that's fucking funny. First Gandalf. Well, actually, no, we've seen two Gandalfs.

193
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:37,059
That's how it happens in the movie. Well, copyright. Let's go over copyright real quick.

194
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,820
One of the things we want to make sure is that we add a very, very transformative material.

195
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:50,119
These are obviously parodies and satires of these movies. Trying to get as close to

196
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:56,730
fair use as we can, obviously. Very, very transformed media. This is not a typical

197
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:05,239
Lord of the Rings. This is called German Noir, Murder on 985 Street.

198
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:42,280
Hey, hey, what's up, man? How are you? Yeah, I got a pot coming for you right here.

199
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:54,199
And it's drinking or smoking. Tell them with the hardest of hearts. No, I don't need to do that.

200
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:10,329
I don't care. Freshly brewed. There it is. Put your cup up. There it is. Give me your honest

201
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:20,179
opinion. I want to know the real deal. Tasty, isn't it? That hurts a little. Very good. Yeah,

202
00:49:20,179 --> 00:50:02,619
it's very good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, shit. You got me. Wait, how was it? What? What the

203
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:32,039
fuck? What that? What was that? What was that? What was that? I'm gonna lie down. Oh, no.

204
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:56,889
Right through the birch bees. That was awesome. Wait, what? What was it? Thanks to Jerma for

205
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:02,090
providing all the mocap, even though he ripped the suit like 16 times and ate all the wires

206
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:07,829
like spaghetti. That cannot be confirmed. You don't have any evidence that that actually happened.

207
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:20,280
Oh, man. That's funny. That was great. Glue man appearance. Jerma is a wizard. I knew there's

208
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,159
gonna be a shitload of these. Well, class, it's been a pleasure. Absolute pleasure. But you all.

209
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:34,679
Oh, my God. Understand the power of the Dark Lord. And for that reason, I'm out. Just like that show.

210
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:51,780
Shut up. Holy shit. What the fuck? What the fuck? Jerma had an exhibition. What the hell? That was

211
00:51:51,780 --> 00:53:08,820
so fast. What the hell is going on here? Oh, come on. I can't. Dante and Virgil.

212
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:16,860
Okay, I gotta ask a question. Do you want to hear my laughs over all these? Or should I just mute?

213
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:25,349
I don't want to ruin these because these are so goddamn funny. No, we want to hear it. We want

214
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:35,880
to hear. Okay. All right. I'll keep it on. That was Jerma's at an exhibition.

215
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:48,090
Jerma 95 green screen rare VHS recording. Jeremy Albertson as Mario. What the fuck? Wait,

216
00:53:48,090 --> 00:54:30,679
hold on. We gotta start this over. This actually has- I'm Jeremy Albertson,

217
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:37,429
aka the actor of Super Mario. But you know what's not Yahoo and what's not cool? Drugs and alcohol.

218
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:45,769
If somebody pressures you into smoking or drinking, tell them no. And you can tell them so long.

219
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:52,679
So long, King Bowser. Take it from me. Have a pretty cool life, don't you think?

220
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:05,530
Swing your arms from side to side. Come on and everyone go do the Mario. Swing your arms

221
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:13,030
from side to side. Come on, let's go. Let's do the Mario. Is that the Mario for you?

222
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:46,550
Yahoo that one. Oh my God. Jerma in the middle. Fuck on his head. Is that the bus?

223
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:49,510
Why did you miss it? That's not the bus.

224
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:55,130
Ah, idiot. Okay, let me see the car. I can do it.

225
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:01,610
How are we doing? How are we? Okay. Easy on the gas. Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

226
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:10,570
You screwed that up. I'm not scared. You bumped his balls. Hey, that's crazy.

227
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:17,059
You're pretty dumb. I'm not scared at all. You're dumb. You're not good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,739
You're very clear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

229
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:51,369
All right, that's enough. Oh my God. Mean mustache guy. Mean mustache guy. I gotta say that hurts.

230
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:58,360
I think that's very fair. I think everything I said was, you know, I was very angry at certain

231
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,960
things. This can't be right. Hey, I don't want to be that. I'm not the angry mustache guy.

232
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:13,800
My name is Sean, okay. I don't get it. That's what you can call me. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

233
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,320
And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights

234
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,760
at So Do I? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I hear. I'm here to fight for you. Shut up.

235
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:30,010
Shut up. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all stupid idiots.

236
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:40,059
You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Turn that off. Turn that off. I'm

237
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:45,900
ashamed, Sean. I got, I got buns. I got ketchup. I got mustard. This relish right here too. Please do.

238
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,739
I've got a creamy cheddar risotto. Whose kid is this? Creamy chocolate risotto. And I also

239
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,019
He's going to Harvard.

240
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:07,019
Gravy, potatoes, meat, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers. Yes. Oh, I had a long day at work.

241
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:14,460
Let's go. Tasty, isn't it? Very good. That hurts. I'm dying. It's going to kill me.

242
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:21,659
Holy shit. Steven. That was so fucking crazy. I don't even know where to start with this

243
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:31,670
one. Jesus. This whole thing was just nonstop. It just never stopped. It never turned off.

244
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:45,530
My favorite part. Let me just go over my favorite part. First of all, it's, where is it?

245
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,449
Right here. When we get in the first car accident.

246
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:57,780
So you screwed that up. Of course he did. He's got a clipboard. Oh, caveman. And they're hitting him with the

247
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,150
I don't want to be that. I'm not. Yeah. And the principal talking about, I don't want to be the

248
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:07,670
one of my favorite things about doing the green screen stuff, honest to God is when people take

249
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:13,079
shit out of context and use it somewhere completely different and have it make total sense. Oh man,

250
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:16,760
different and have it make total sense. Oh man, that was good.

251
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:20,250
My name is

252
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:28,730
okay. Don't get it. That's what you can call me. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Oh my goodness gracious.

253
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:38,380
Oh my God. Whose kid is this? That's a double clap for me. That's clap, clap, clap. All right.

254
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:46,519
This next one is, I haven't seen this movie. So I don't, is this from the movie? I don't

255
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:53,429
know. This is from the trailer. I have no idea. But, um, this is apparently, um, I'm, this is the

256
00:59:53,429 --> 01:00:11,349
audience reaction to this. Who cares? Well, I mean, I do. It's not a spoiler. What, what do you want?

257
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:16,230
Is this somebody who records in the theater? Stephen Strange. Wait, wait, hold on. You are now

258
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:24,579
called before the Illuminati. Our first member, Saul Goodman. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know

259
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:33,590
that you have rights? It's warm. It's warm and time.

260
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,679
And finally, the most iconic streamer alive. German. I need five.

261
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:56,519
Yeah. German lied about TF2. What did I do? This is terrible. Nothing about this is good.

262
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:12,469
What is going on? Okay. Yes.

263
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:17,099
Oh, I'm going to get chucked up.

264
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:42,659
All your days are belong to us.

265
01:01:43,320 --> 01:02:05,590
Oh, my God.

266
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:19,579
V6 engine. What do you got back here? Not as good as mine. He's dangerous.

267
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:58,340
This is so strong. I chopped you up in a meat grinder. The only thing that comes out is your

268
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,500
eyeball. You're probably dead.

269
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:22,940
In moderation, if you're old enough and you can be careful with it.

270
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:26,380
Alcohol, if you're old enough, be careful with it. Do you don't need to do anything else?

271
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:29,659
God, that was fucking crazy. We're going to be watching some more infomercials.

272
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:35,610
All right. This is long lost real men of genius Bud Light advertisement.

273
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:49,110
There's been some crazy ones. Hey, let's go. I have a bunch of queued up here.

274
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:53,960
First one seems very, very interesting. And I'm very curious how it plays out.

275
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:08,150
Non-specific alcohol brand presents real germas of genius. Real germas of genius.

276
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,869
Today, we salute you, Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown.

277
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:18,550
Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown. You could play video games like a normal streamer,

278
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:24,230
yet you let your unhinged mania take the wheel and twerk in a dollar store crown to an audience

279
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:31,269
of 20,000. 20K Andy. Your community. Hey, 35K Andy now. Not to share your horrifying

280
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:37,909
tales of everyday life, but you do it anyway. This guy is insane. Some may ask,

281
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:46,150
there's no way this guy's real, but unfortunately you are. This is a cry for hell. So crack open

282
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:51,909
an ice cold red wine, oh, King of the jungle, because your reign of terror won't last forever.

283
01:04:52,789 --> 01:05:01,500
Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown. That hurts a little. That's supposed to feel like that.

284
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:08,619
Jerma joins the Cruelty Squad. All right, I've never played Cruelty Squad, by the way.

285
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:17,340
Oh, these are fucking great. If you've never played Cruelty Squad, whatever the name of this

286
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:22,260
game is, if you've never played Cruelty Squad, be careful. This might be a spoiler. And I think

287
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,460
the game has flashing lights, so be careful. Okay, three, two, one, let's go.

288
01:05:25,460 --> 01:06:51,539
Oh, wait, wait, wait, okay, hold on. Jerma auditions to replace Jerma.

289
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:59,539
What do you got for us coming out here? All right.

290
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,579
So you're going to do a routine with the nunchucks and okay. Yeah, for sure. Number 13, whenever

291
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:21,880
you're ready. All right. That was a tease, but that was good. That was very good. Wow. Well,

292
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,840
that's interesting because if you think that you have what it takes to be me,

293
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,719
then you need to have what it takes to beat me. Because you're going against the master now.

294
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:39,480
This is incredible.

295
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,050
Okay, you want to fucking go? Hey, Jerma985 here.

296
01:07:53,849 --> 01:08:03,110
Jerma, real Jerma. Real Jerma. Let's get this imposter out of here.

297
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:07,989
Hey, in case they don't see him. Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

298
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:15,610
Oh, by the way, I think it's a good time to bring this up. So somebody had a submission

299
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:21,060
to green screen movie night and they were like, oh, is this okay? And we were like, oh, yeah.

300
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:28,500
I was contacted by one of the mods that said, hey, so somebody made this green screen edit.

301
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:36,060
It's way longer than three minutes. It's in fact, the entire movie, The Truman Show,

302
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:41,699
the whole runtime of the entire film, but you are replaced in every single scene.

303
01:08:41,699 --> 01:08:50,500
And it's like, well, no, we can't do that. First of all. First of all, I can't do that. And second

304
01:08:50,500 --> 01:09:01,100
of all, why? Why the whole movie? My favorite part about it, though, is there was a back and forth

305
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,420
where it was just like, hey, it's just like, I mean, I kind of went a little overboard

306
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:15,979
or something, right? It's like, yeah, it's the whole movie, dude. I don't want to talk.

307
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:22,569
Obviously, I cannot show an entire movie here, right? But that's all I'm going to say.

308
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:32,760
That's hilarious. It's absolutely hilarious. Let me just take one second. I got to make sure

309
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:41,060
that we have the right amount of movies left. I can confirm. Yes, Grump is DMing me. That is

310
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:51,609
correct. Correct number of videos. Oh, man. But that's so funny. OK, so here we go.

311
01:09:51,609 --> 01:10:07,989
Jerma Psychotic Adventures in the Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Here we go. Oh, Oblivion. OK, let's start.

312
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:52,390
You are the one from my dreams. I've never played Oblivion. I don't know how this works.

313
01:10:53,750 --> 01:11:02,250
I've never played one minute of Oblivion. Then the stars were right. This is the day. Gods give me

314
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:37,189
strength. Take me like three times. I'm crazy or not, right? This is two left hands.

315
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:55,640
Die, you motherfucker. Stop. What do you do? Stop criminal scum, right? Stop right there,

316
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:02,359
criminal scum. Is it stop criminal scum? Stop. You violated the law. Stop you violated. OK,

317
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:09,079
you violated the law. Stop right there, criminal scum. Stop criminal scum. You violated the law.

318
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:16,600
You violated the law. Now pay your fine or it's off to jail. You will pay in blood. Then pay with

319
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:33,220
your blood. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. What little patience I have is wearing thin. Stop. Stop. I

320
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:47,659
have no time for mindless blather. Oh, looks like you are in some trouble. Don't worry. I'll look

321
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:57,109
the other way and take care of that fine for you. Stop. Now that you've given us a taste,

322
01:12:57,189 --> 01:13:01,510
you're going to lose this group. All this Gregor's want more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

323
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:11,479
That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all

324
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:21,289
stupid idiots. You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here. Yeah. Now get to turn that off.

325
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:35,420
Sachet away. You're the driving instructor. Hold on. This is a real one. This one's filmed in real

326
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:46,229
life, by the way. We got another real one. You're the driving instructor. All right. Could you

327
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:50,470
pull this way and park for me, please? Over here. Parallel park in this spot right here. There's two

328
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:55,989
spots available. Not the one in front of the red truck. The one behind it. Behind it? Behind

329
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:02,470
the red truck. Use your eyes. You screwed that up. What you needed to do there is you had to.

330
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:09,340
I'm not happy about it very much. I'm trying.

331
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:19,750
You just hit it. You hit it. You bumped his bumper. You're not getting your license today,

332
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:28,090
by the way. Make that very clear. What I have here is I have two bumped cars. I have, would you like

333
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,130
to see the notes? I don't. You can see it if you want. Would you like to see what I've written

334
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:37,350
down? I don't want. Go ahead and look. You bumped a car. You couldn't go more than, you went 40,

335
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:41,989
50 miles per hour getting on the on-ramp to the highway. And not only that, you don't know how to

336
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:49,819
parallel park. And you guess what? I don't either. Am I on the right side here? Yes. You're pretty

337
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:55,340
dumb. Can I just tell you? You're dumb. Do you want me to stop? No human drives a car like this.

338
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:59,659
No human. You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably do better than the test than

339
01:14:59,659 --> 01:15:04,060
you did. Okay. In fact, you'd get an armadillo to do this test and it probably would do better than

340
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,939
you just did. You get an ant. You get me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel,

341
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:12,539
four or five thousand ants, and I could train them to do a better parallel parking job.

342
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:17,899
You don't think I could do that? You don't think I could train ants to do that? You don't think I'm

343
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:23,770
smart enough to train ants? They'd be running circles around you, by the way. This is ridiculous.

344
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:30,090
Terrible. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

345
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:35,930
Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right? What's in front of us? It's a stop sign. Stop sign.

346
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:44,680
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Keep going. Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull

347
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,060
that McDonald's. Very important part of your test. Driving through a drive-through is actually very

348
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:56,300
hard. It's a very narrow road. It's a very narrow part of it. It's hard to kind of navigate in there.

349
01:15:56,859 --> 01:16:07,590
Stop. Roll your window down. Get out of the way. Yeah, I'll take two double cheeseburgers,

350
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:17,430
three McChickens, and a small drink. By the way, they ran out of my sauce. They ran out of my

351
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:24,170
sauce, my Szechuan sauce. That's all going on your record here. This is fucking crazy. Hey, howdy,

352
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:28,170
how are you? Thank you. Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you. Can you put it over here?

353
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:45,770
That was seriously unbelievable. Oh, God, that's so fucking funny. Oh, the fact that you did,

354
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:54,119
because the funniest part about that is that dude's just kind of driving around and just reacting to

355
01:16:54,119 --> 01:17:01,979
this weird guy in his passenger side, right? That's acting right there. God, that was funny.

356
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:09,939
All right, this is Jerome. Here's again. Hello, I'm John Lugamy from Look At This

357
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:15,300
News Network. In a previous exclusive, we shared the heartwarming story of Jeremy Elbertson,

358
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,340
a man who had shown us his first time hearing in over 30 years. Wow. Half a year later,

359
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:25,300
we caught up with Jeremy to see what he's been doing since then. We set up an online interview

360
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:30,260
to get a glimpse into the life of a born again man. Thank you for being with us today, Jeremy.

361
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:34,819
Thanks for having me. It seems there's connection issues, but that's okay. Since we're gaining his

362
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:38,979
hearing, Jeremy has been working in numerous television roles, such as charity work for drug

363
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,579
awareness campaigns. But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun,

364
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:52,659
but it's not totally Yahoo. Drugs and alcohol. Stay away from them. As well as AMC's hit series,

365
01:17:52,659 --> 01:18:06,739
Better Call Saul. Better Call Saul, spoilers potentially ahead. I need a little more. Pat,

366
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:18,869
pass me the salt, please. Thank you. Very good. That's a patty. Two chops coming up, two chops.

367
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:22,869
He's even auditioned for the next Spider-Man trilogy featuring Spider-Man

368
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:38,729
and series newcomer Michael Morbius. Oh God, it's Mormon time. Let's go. Jeremy has been a patron

369
01:18:38,729 --> 01:18:44,010
of the local arts, performing at open mic nights, teaching upcoming stars his knowledge. He's

370
01:18:44,010 --> 01:19:02,279
displayed talents in magic. It's a joker. Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you. And show tunes.

371
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:14,619
Misery. Every single person is my enemy. It seems Jeremy has been busy these last few months

372
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:19,260
and goodening the lives of others. We asked Jeremy how we too can end good in lives,

373
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:24,939
and he left us with this advice. If you're not feeling great, but you can make somebody else,

374
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:31,260
you know that you can make somebody else feel good and be like happy. Do it. Wow. Inspiring.

375
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:37,100
I'm John. Look at me. And this has been a look at this news exclusive. Thank you for watching.

376
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:49,829
With the first table already seated, Rachel seems agitated. He's not ready and there's hardly

377
01:19:49,829 --> 01:19:54,390
anything on the menu. So he's not ready. I've never seen anything like this. I've not seen anything

378
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:58,869
like this. I only know how to make risotto besides that. I don't know. It's burning.

379
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,590
You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't. Oh, he's very angry.

380
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:09,350
Sire, he's angry. Welcome to the madhouse. Stupid, you're all stupid idiots.

381
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:13,500
You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here.

382
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:21,020
Is this normal? Yes. It's very hard to control them and that is a problem.

383
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,500
This nut has lost his marbles. This is so sad, you know.

384
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:34,060
Coffee. Hey, coffee. When do I get paid? Who wants coffee? Let's go. What's the matter?

385
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:43,159
Let go. You will pay in blood. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. It looks like I'm going to have

386
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:56,659
to take Jermad to the nut house myself. What the fuck? The goo-goo nest ad? It's more than that.

387
01:20:56,659 --> 01:21:02,100
With the goo-goo nest doorbell, know if it's a cycle, a corvius, or Jerma. Security with

388
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:10,260
goo-goo smarts on the goo-goo nest doorbell. Do you like drugs? Do you like drugs? I've got a lot.

389
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:17,880
Weed. Coke. That's all I got. I don't got anything else but you know, common.

390
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:28,100
Really, really beautiful lawn you have too. Yeah, I got kids. Yeah, we all get kids, right?

391
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,859
Look, if you ever um, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out.

392
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:34,979
With the goo-goo nest doorbell, I've got paid either way.

393
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:50,310
Oh my goodness. Okay, this is the J-985 incident. My voice is already gone. It's only been an hour

394
01:21:50,310 --> 01:22:00,470
and a half. Okay, this is a scary one, I think. The J-985 incident could be scary.

395
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:11,350
We are currently receiving numerous reports of hostile activity around the country.

396
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:18,229
A certain person has been seen near the places of the incidents. They are usually described

397
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:26,149
as unusually short by Psycho or the Suspy, but do not be fooled by its appearance. In fact,

398
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:30,630
it is an ancient entity of an unknown origin that has already been known to us,

399
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:35,029
but recently has started growing its influence and is becoming aggressive.

400
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:40,069
In the scientific community, it is referred to as J-985,

401
01:22:40,069 --> 01:22:46,310
J for its ever juvenile appearance and 985 being the year of its first occurrence.

402
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:50,550
If you live within the highlighted area, please exert extra caution.

403
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:07,539
I'm seven, seven.

404
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:33,000
Hey, hey, what's up? How are you? I'm doing great. Yeah, I just moved in. Yep, new to the neighborhood.

405
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:38,260
Right. Look, if you ever, um, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out

406
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:42,340
and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever, I don't, I don't, I don't care.

407
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:49,140
Can I, can I come in? Can I just come in and we'll get some mojitos? I make an insane mojito.

408
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,539
You don't understand. I don't, I don't, I don't care about that. I have to come in though. Can

409
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:58,739
I come in your house? Oh, by the way, in case you didn't know, I'm the sus guy.

410
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:01,539
What the fuck was that? Was that the sus guy? What was that?

411
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:30,760
Amazon logo on the side of the box. Holy shit.

412
01:24:54,569 --> 01:25:07,579
Oh my God. That, that was crazy. Very good. Very good. All right. This is a Super Derma

413
01:25:07,579 --> 01:25:14,789
64. Derma's amazing adventure. The Mario ones have been legit so far. So window jump. Yeah.

414
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:18,550
I, I, that got me off guard. Okay. Here we go.

415
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:37,380
Okie dokie. Oh, ha ha. Oh, hee hee. Oh, bingo. Oh, ha ha. Hee hee. Oh.

416
01:25:47,609 --> 01:26:02,300
Hey Toad. Oh no. Oh no. Mario need an alibi.

417
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:25,399
Come on, let's go. Let's do a little Mario. Oh, just here I go. Oh, I love cookie. Oh, cookie.

418
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:30,100
Okie dokie. Cookies? What am I talking about?

419
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:16,739
You can't stop me from doing drugs.

420
01:27:16,739 --> 01:28:18,069
Oh, that was great.

421
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:29,960
What's next? Saw, saw 22. That's okay. Here we go.

422
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:41,369
There's a key inside of your eyeball. You need to dig it up with your bare hands and then eat it

423
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:45,770
and then shit it out. When you shit it out, then only then can you use the key

424
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,930
to unlock the bear trap that's around John's neck.

425
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:12,250
John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John. Wait, wait, wait. How did he get in here?

426
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:16,250
How did he get in here? How did he get in here? You're not supposed to be able to get in here.

427
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:23,829
Ow. Ow. No. No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

428
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:26,390
Make your choice. Your choice is you can kill me.

429
01:29:27,909 --> 01:29:44,840
Hi everyone. My name is Sean Elvington. I'm the actor, writer, director, producer,

430
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:49,800
and main talent of the daytime television show. Jigsaw is here.

431
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:54,819
And I just have something very important that we all have to do. We have to make choices.

432
01:29:55,699 --> 01:30:00,520
And one choice is for you to watch this show because the ratings have been very poor

433
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,909
and I believe that we are below reruns of infomercials at this point.

434
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:10,550
So I figured we could give you a quick little like maybe you could watch the show if you want.

435
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:18,869
For the six to seven hundred of you that do watch the show, thank you so much. It means a lot.

436
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:20,710
Cast and crew, we have to put a lot of time into this show.

437
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:24,550
So we'll get back to it though. Let's get back to your regularly scheduled programming of

438
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:29,109
Jigsaw's coming for you. Written and directed, starring, and produced by me, Sean Elvington.

439
01:30:33,289 --> 01:30:39,140
Oh my God, that was fucking great. How did he get in here?

440
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:44,340
Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. Germaland, a lost episode.

441
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:56,710
You got another cart back there. You're gonna have to bring it in.

442
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:09,800
Right. Look, I don't, I don't, I don't care. I don't, I don't, I don't,

443
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,359
I don't care about that. Call somebody else. That's not, I'm literally just here trying to work.

444
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:23,539
Why are you, why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I don't want,

445
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:27,619
I don't want to hear this. I put up with these fucking people. I swear to God, just screaming

446
01:31:27,619 --> 01:31:42,229
at me. See, that's it. That's, that's $49. Yeah, put your card in. It goes the other way.

447
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:47,210
It goes the other way. The card reader, it goes the other way. You have a chip on it, right?

448
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:53,210
You have a chip. The chip goes, chip facing in. How many stores have you been to in your whole life

449
01:31:53,210 --> 01:32:10,970
that you don't know the chip goes the other way? So mean. That was cute. That was cute.

450
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:35,560
All right, what we got next? Remember the X-Wing pilot, Reed E.

451
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,520
Hey, maybe you could get us, maybe get us a few rounds and we're done with this,

452
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,439
you know what I'm saying? Holy shit.

453
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:51,239
Deepest, darkest, like Star Wars fantasies.

454
01:32:53,239 --> 01:33:11,590
Watch your status. Watch out, watch out, TIE fighters, TIE fighters coming in.

455
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:22,789
Left side, right side. I can't see him, I can't get him, I can't get him, I can't see him.

456
01:33:23,829 --> 01:33:24,789
This is crazy.

457
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:37,659
Paper, Jerma? Jerma's Big Adventure, wait, hold on a minute.

458
01:33:38,859 --> 01:33:43,510
Jerma's Big Adventure 2 development reveal. Wait, what? What?

459
01:33:50,550 --> 01:34:36,149
Real game. What? Holy shit, this is insane. We've seen a few games come through here.

460
01:34:36,149 --> 01:35:13,670
We've seen probably like five to 10 games and they're all awesome. Damn, actually awesome.

461
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:40,859
Jerma's Big Adventure 2 now in development. Wow, hell yeah.

462
01:35:41,659 --> 01:35:48,810
There's other games that I have not shown. There's just, honestly, there's just so much.

463
01:35:49,529 --> 01:36:11,619
Wait a minute, what the hell was that? That was terrifying.

464
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:17,079
But what I was going to say is people in this community are so creative

465
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:24,710
that so much shit like this comes out. It's just, it's just hard to even believe sometimes.

466
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:28,329
So there's other things, other games that have been in development that

467
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:31,369
are kind of focused on the community that I have not even shown yet.

468
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:37,659
I haven't, you haven't even seen it. Really, really cool, really cool stuff.

469
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:42,260
Here comes Spider-Man 4 teaser trailer. Very real, emotional.

470
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:47,579
Here comes, this is going to be probably Spider-Man spoilers for the, you know, you know the deal.

471
01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:50,699
But I did put on the Spider-Man suit, so here we go.

472
01:37:11,609 --> 01:37:13,239
Have you crashed your computer?

473
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:21,109
I'm here to tell you that you have a choice to make, not do the makeshift.

474
01:37:21,109 --> 01:37:22,949
Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.

475
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:39,399
Oh, you have an idea of who you're dealing with? All right, Spider-Man.

476
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,659
Who's that new man?

477
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:12,890
There is nothing out there like the Turbo Quicker.

478
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:18,220
Oh, I can't wait for this one. Why was Saul in that movie?

479
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:24,170
Right, why did Saul have to be in that movie? Oh, again, Peter.

480
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:26,890
Oh, man. All right, this is, that was great.

481
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:28,409
This is fucking hilarious.

482
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:32,380
Kathy Mitchell's Turbo Cooker, featuring real testimonials.

483
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,260
Okay, let's go.

484
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,539
Because there's nothing out there like the Turbo Cooker,

485
01:38:36,539 --> 01:38:40,779
we decided to give Turbo Cookers to a number of people to use in their own homes.

486
01:38:40,779 --> 01:38:42,659
Let's hear what they had to say.

487
01:38:42,739 --> 01:38:46,579
I can take frozen meat out of the freezer, frozen vegetables out of the freezer,

488
01:38:46,579 --> 01:38:49,699
and have a meal ready in 15 or 20 minutes.

489
01:38:49,699 --> 01:38:53,779
It's healthy, it's good, and it's good for me.

490
01:38:53,779 --> 01:38:57,619
You can really minimize the amount of oil that you use in cooking.

491
01:38:57,619 --> 01:39:04,840
Well, I mean, ever since I was on my own, I, you know, started to cook for myself.

492
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:14,140
Ever since I was on my own, and I learned how to make mushroom risotto, and yeah.

493
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:21,659
You get the properties of the frying, and you get this remarkable tenderness to the meat.

494
01:39:21,659 --> 01:39:25,979
I never thought that you could steam a cake on the top of the stove,

495
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:30,699
and it turned out so moist better than anything I've ever had.

496
01:39:30,699 --> 01:39:33,340
And that's what my mom taught me, you know.

497
01:39:34,779 --> 01:39:35,979
I call her every Sunday.

498
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:42,229
It's just easier, it's much healthier, and it brings everything together.

499
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:45,109
I like to be able to taste the food that you've just eaten,

500
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:46,630
and have that flavor come through.

501
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:51,350
So I would much rather do it this way here than to use all that oil to cook it.

502
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,939
I may have undercooked it.

503
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:02,229
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

504
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:06,069
Kathy, thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing us the turbo cooker.

505
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:07,989
This is great, it's a complete system.

506
01:40:07,989 --> 01:40:09,590
It's never going to leave our stove tops.

507
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:09,989
Never.

508
01:40:09,989 --> 01:40:10,949
You knew I wanted it.

509
01:40:10,949 --> 01:40:12,949
The incredible turbo cooker.

510
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:19,289
There is nothing out there like the turbo.

511
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:22,600
The whole point with these products is you can't fuck it up.

512
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,119
You put a steak in, and you come back in six minutes, and it's done.

513
01:40:26,119 --> 01:40:32,840
You can't undercook something.

514
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,279
These things are foolproof.

515
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:35,159
You can't mess it up.

516
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,739
I may have undercooked it.

517
01:40:44,069 --> 01:40:48,149
Oh my god, Jesus Christ.

518
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:50,310
All right, let's keep going.

519
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:55,109
This one is a Spider-Man versus Jigsaw.

520
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:55,590
Here we go.

521
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:11,720
It's me, Jigsaw.

522
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:20,729
You have no idea who you're dealing with?

523
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:22,810
I'm Spider-Man.

524
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:28,170
Six weeks ago, you had over 40 Pornhub tabs open at the same time.

525
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,409
And you crashed your computer.

526
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:36,970
So now you have 40 computers with 40 different porn videos on them.

527
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:40,390
40 separate pornography videos.

528
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:47,340
You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother.

529
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,539
I usually, I thought I...

530
01:41:48,539 --> 01:41:49,039
Find you.

531
01:41:49,579 --> 01:41:51,449
You have one minute.

532
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:52,250
One minute?

533
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:52,890
Make your choice.

534
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:53,449
I got one minute.

535
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,579
All right, I got one minute on a clock.

536
01:41:56,579 --> 01:41:57,060
I can do this.

537
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,140
All these computers here?

538
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:00,659
Okay.

539
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:01,380
All right.

540
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:02,739
Now, clock's going on now.

541
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:08,890
Which one?

542
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:09,609
Which one do I start with?

543
01:42:09,609 --> 01:42:10,329
First, this one over here.

544
01:42:10,329 --> 01:42:11,770
I'm going to hack into that.

545
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,409
Oh, by the way, Peter, forgot to mention.

546
01:42:14,409 --> 01:42:16,409
I know you only have 45 seconds left.

547
01:42:17,689 --> 01:42:23,699
The room is about to fill with gas, nerd gas.

548
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:25,140
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

549
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,220
Oh, I know nerd gas very well.

550
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:30,579
I said nerd gas install one through five.

551
01:42:31,779 --> 01:42:33,859
Will you be able to succeed?

552
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,220
I did what you wanted.

553
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,020
I shut them all off.

554
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,010
Oh, you did it.

555
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:38,810
You did it.

556
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:40,569
Hey, he did it.

557
01:42:41,369 --> 01:42:42,489
You actually did it.

558
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,180
I did it.

559
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,300
Steve, what's your name again?

560
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:45,779
I forget.

561
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:47,699
Good job.

562
01:42:47,699 --> 01:42:48,500
Go through the door.

563
01:42:49,619 --> 01:42:50,340
Go out the door.

564
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:50,840
You did it.

565
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:53,659
How did he get in here?

566
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,180
How did he get in here?

567
01:42:55,819 --> 01:42:57,449
You're not supposed to be able to get in here.

568
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:02,170
Ow, ouch.

569
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:05,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

570
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:06,890
You didn't make your choice.

571
01:43:07,529 --> 01:43:08,649
Your choice is to be killed.

572
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:16,229
Dude, all right, I have a question.

573
01:43:17,449 --> 01:43:19,850
Why has nobody actually made it a lightsaber?

574
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:23,529
It's just nobody has put the the light blade at the end.

575
01:43:23,529 --> 01:43:24,489
It's just a stick.

576
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:32,380
You let you open the door.

577
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:33,659
That's so ridiculous.

578
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:34,539
I need to do that again.

579
01:43:34,539 --> 01:43:36,539
How did he get in here?

580
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:38,539
How did he get in here?

581
01:43:38,539 --> 01:43:40,710
How did he get in here?

582
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:43,399
How did he get in here?

583
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:45,399
You're not supposed to be able to get in here!

584
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:48,859
Ow!

585
01:43:48,859 --> 01:43:50,859
No, no, no, no, no!

586
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:52,859
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

587
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:54,859
You didn't make your choice.

588
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:56,859
Your choice is to be killed.

589
01:43:56,859 --> 01:44:03,510
What was the- there was a part in the beginning

590
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:07,800
that was funny too.

591
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:15,720
God damn it.

592
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:20,630
That was a good one.

593
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:25,979
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

594
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:28,720
Thanks for coming out.

595
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,720
We got a new song that we're going to play for you here.

596
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:35,119
Hi there.

597
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,680
Alright, yeah, we're going to play a new song.

598
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,680
This one is something we've been working on for a long time.

599
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,680
I hope you all enjoy it.

600
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,680
It's going to be peppy, it's going to be a lot of upbeat,

601
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,300
so hopefully see somebody out there dancing.

602
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,949
And a one, two,

603
01:44:49,949 --> 01:45:05,819
a one, two, three, four.

604
01:45:05,819 --> 01:45:10,220
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

605
01:45:17,649 --> 01:45:28,779
This is hot, how does it go?

606
01:45:29,779 --> 01:45:31,789
Hello, my baby.

607
01:45:31,789 --> 01:45:35,500
No, I can't, you do it.

608
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
I get nervous when we're on a frog.

609
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,500
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

610
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,500
I got it.

611
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:44,829
What will I do?

612
01:45:44,829 --> 01:45:46,829
Check your seat.

613
01:45:46,829 --> 01:45:48,829
Fucking god damn it, it was so close.

614
01:45:50,829 --> 01:45:52,829
It was so close!

615
01:45:52,829 --> 01:45:58,140
Oh my god.

616
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Arjo, huh?

617
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,739
Wait, how was it?

618
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:11,739
Okay, I can try one more time.

619
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:44,369
Switch controller.

620
01:46:44,369 --> 01:46:47,760
Oh my god.

621
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:19,090
Oh my god.

622
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:22,529
Stop.

623
01:47:22,529 --> 01:47:25,659
I've never played Oblivion, I don't know how this works.

624
01:47:25,659 --> 01:47:27,659
I've never played one minute of Oblivion.

625
01:47:27,659 --> 01:47:29,659
No, I streamed like a day.

626
01:47:29,659 --> 01:47:34,720
Yo, it's a me, Mario.

627
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,720
Oh, okie dokie.

628
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,720
Oh, haha.

629
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,720
Oh, hee hee.

630
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
Oh, bingo.

631
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
Oh, haha, hee hee.

632
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:50,289
Oh, where's Luigi?

633
01:47:50,289 --> 01:47:52,590
Where's Luigi?

634
01:47:52,590 --> 01:48:01,229
I love all the Mario ones.

635
01:48:01,229 --> 01:48:03,229
They're like so fun.

636
01:48:03,229 --> 01:48:25,939
Ok, I think it's on.

637
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,380
Uh oh.

638
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:45,060
Yep.

639
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,060
Yep, yep, yep.

640
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,300
I'm fucking done with this job.

641
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,300
I'm never fucking doing Mario ever again.

642
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:57,250
Boat rage.

643
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,250
I learned this one when I was traveling.

644
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:20,029
Oh no.

645
01:49:20,029 --> 01:49:30,340
Please come.

646
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:32,340
Don't splash me.

647
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:34,340
Throw him out. He splashed me with water.

648
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:36,340
Don't splash me.

649
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,340
Splashing, you can't splash here.

650
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,340
It says it on the sign before we walked in.

651
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:42,340
I'm getting away from him.

652
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:45,979
Those of you that want to hear

653
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:47,979
another song, follow me please.

654
01:49:49,979 --> 01:49:56,640
This one's called the train tracks.

655
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:23,869
No, I don't care.

656
01:50:23,869 --> 01:50:34,109
What'd I get?

657
01:50:36,109 --> 01:50:38,109
That's a big one.

658
01:50:38,109 --> 01:50:45,149
I'll get one more out there.

659
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:47,460
That's a big one right here.

660
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,460
That's a huge one.

661
01:50:57,970 --> 01:51:10,430
I always have to be traveling.

662
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:12,430
That was awesome by the way.

663
01:51:14,430 --> 01:51:19,220
Oh shit.

664
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:23,220
It's wrapping for this one.

665
01:51:23,220 --> 01:52:26,430
That was awesome.

666
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:29,380
That was fucking awesome.

667
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,680
Wow. Nice work.

668
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:35,840
Germania 2022 character reveal.

669
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
Madness update out now.

670
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,560
Wonder what that means.

671
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

672
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,800
Welcome to the second ever

673
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
Germa Roman.

674
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,800
I hope you're ready for some newcomers

675
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:58,800
as well as some old vagabonds.

676
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
The cave grew into groceries in a good world.

677
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
That's what he typically does.

678
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,800
Tell them you're the sus guy.

679
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,800
Brrram, brrram, brrram.

680
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,680
I must find out what happened.

681
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,680
I must uncover the secrets

682
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:15,680
of my old family.

683
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,680
The secrets.

684
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:19,680
Oh my god.

685
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:24,619
No, no, no, no.

686
01:53:24,619 --> 01:53:26,619
I see something horrible.

687
01:53:26,619 --> 01:53:29,119
I'm close.

688
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:44,979
Damn.

689
01:53:44,979 --> 01:53:46,979
Holy shit. Hold on a second.

690
01:53:46,979 --> 01:53:53,819
Wait a minute, wait a minute. We gotta go back.

691
01:53:53,819 --> 01:53:55,819
I wanna see that combo.

692
01:53:55,819 --> 01:53:57,819
That combo was sick.

693
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:06,779
Look at this, watch this combo.

694
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:08,779
I must find out what happened.

695
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:10,779
I must uncover the secrets

696
01:54:10,779 --> 01:54:12,779
of my old family.

697
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:14,779
The secrets, the secrets.

698
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:21,279
Oh no, no, no.

699
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:23,279
I see something horrible.

700
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:29,539
I'm close.

701
01:54:29,539 --> 01:54:36,319
Dude, that was awesome.

702
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:38,319
Alright, we're gonna exit.

703
01:54:38,319 --> 01:54:40,319
It has to be a big shot.

704
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:42,319
Deltarune.

705
01:54:51,819 --> 01:54:53,819
Damn.

706
01:55:48,689 --> 01:55:55,260
That was awesome.

707
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:58,529
Dump truck studios.

708
01:55:58,529 --> 01:56:01,659
Holy smokes.

709
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:03,659
The mod chat is lighting up here.

710
01:56:03,659 --> 01:56:06,340
How did some of you guys

711
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:09,470
do this shit in two weeks?

712
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:11,470
You know what I mean? Some of you made these in

713
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:19,710
four days. Huh?

714
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:23,170
Unbelievable. Alright, after this one we're gonna take

715
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:25,170
a quick intermission. I'm gonna go pee. I'm gonna refill

716
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:27,170
my water and I might

717
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:30,560
get a little bit of an alcoholic beverage.

718
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,460
This is a German 95 RPG.

719
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:44,510
I wonder, I'm curious.

720
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:50,720
Are you ready? Bald coins.

721
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:58,430
Got it. Auto. Auto.

722
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:05,579
The giant rat.

723
01:57:05,579 --> 01:57:07,579
Alright, you cartoon monster.

724
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:09,579
Okay, now I kill you.

725
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,500
You shall not pass.

726
01:57:39,909 --> 01:57:43,050
I can't just stand here all day, dude.

727
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:08,460
That one is bad.

728
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,909
Let's go. Look at me right now.

729
01:58:11,909 --> 01:58:14,409
I won.

730
01:58:14,409 --> 01:58:17,479
Nice. That was awesome.

731
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:21,479
Alright, one more. One more and we'll take a

732
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:23,479
pee break.

733
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:52,100
I'll leave. I'll leave. I'll leave, but

734
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:54,100
that's...

735
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:56,340
Are you ready? I bet you're

736
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:58,340
scared. I'm not scared at all.

737
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:00,340
Where am I?

738
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:02,340
What's going on here?

739
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:04,340
Yeah. Okay.

740
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:06,970
Are you ready? Because, I mean,

741
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:08,970
very clearly we gotta go.

742
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,970
You have an idea who you're dealing with?

743
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:13,460
Alright, Spider-Man.

744
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,460
Are you ready? You don't look ready.

745
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:17,460
It's alright. I'm alright. I'm alright.

746
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:20,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:22,020
Hey. How much?

748
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:27,260
Huh? You're the one with the money.

749
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,989
Hey. You know what I mean?

750
01:59:29,989 --> 01:59:32,420
How much?

751
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,420
No, I ain't gonna scream.

752
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:39,220
You're gonna scream, though.

753
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,220
Did you know that you have rights?

754
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,220
I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're doing.

755
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,229
I really am.

756
01:59:46,229 --> 01:59:48,229
It's Master Chef, not Master Bait.

757
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:50,229
Hello, students.

758
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:53,109
Welcome to the Defense of the Dark Arts class.

759
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:56,699
My name is

760
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:58,869
Michel Malfoyle. I'm the new

761
01:59:58,869 --> 02:00:01,300
teacher in time.

762
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,300
If we could all open up your textbooks and go to

763
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,300
page 200, please.

764
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,479
We're going to be using...

765
02:00:07,479 --> 02:00:09,479
Yes? Yes?

766
02:00:09,479 --> 02:00:11,479
Ron, please.

767
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:14,619
There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.

768
02:00:14,619 --> 02:00:16,619
Page 200, we're gonna be making a frog

769
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:19,500
breath potion.

770
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500
You know all about that, don't you, Harry?

771
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:24,500
Open up your textbook.

772
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:31,930
I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.

773
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,930
That's not the time to use that spell.

774
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:36,229
No, fuck you.

775
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,229
You see what I got dealing with back here?

776
02:00:38,229 --> 02:00:44,819
Hello, boys and girls.

777
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:47,189
It's-a me, Mario.

778
02:00:47,189 --> 02:00:49,189
Let me tell you something about

779
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:51,750
drugs and alcohol.

780
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:53,750
My brother Luigi.

781
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:04,119
Okay, nobody used this for anything else

782
02:01:04,119 --> 02:01:06,119
besides what we're doing this for.

783
02:01:06,119 --> 02:01:08,119
There's no way anyone's gonna use this for anything else besides

784
02:01:08,119 --> 02:01:10,119
riding a fucking roller coaster.

785
02:01:10,119 --> 02:01:18,500
Alright, that's enough.

786
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,180
Alright.

787
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:23,609
Let's take a quick two, three minute break.

788
02:01:23,609 --> 02:01:27,109
We're at the two hour mark.

789
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:29,109
I'm gonna take a look at the videos. We'll see how much we have left.

790
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:31,109
I think we have another solid, probably at least two, three hours.

791
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:34,810
Let's go pee.

792
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:36,810
Go get another snack, maybe. I'll be back in about three minutes.

793
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:39,560
See you guys in three to four

794
02:01:39,560 --> 02:07:10,569
maybe-ish minutes.

795
02:07:10,569 --> 02:07:15,930
I have returned. Hello.

796
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:23,779
My stomach hurts. My stomach hurts.

797
02:07:23,779 --> 02:07:29,800
Every time we do one of these,

798
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,229
I get an ab workout, unlike any I've

799
02:07:32,229 --> 02:07:35,939
ever had before. This one is called

800
02:07:35,939 --> 02:07:37,939
We're Coming Back. Everyone good?

801
02:07:37,939 --> 02:07:44,859
Are we settled? That's also another reason why

802
02:07:44,859 --> 02:07:47,350
I mean, we can only really do this

803
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:50,020
for four or five

804
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:52,020
hours, you know what I mean? Cause otherwise

805
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,220
I'm gonna die. I will literally die.

806
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:57,850
So don't worry.

807
02:07:57,850 --> 02:08:00,020
We're gonna do this another one or two more times

808
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:02,710
and get through these. I promise.

809
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:10,250
Alright, you guys ready?

810
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:13,579
Let's bring it back. Bring this back too.

811
02:08:13,579 --> 02:08:17,399
And let's keep going. This one's called

812
02:08:17,399 --> 02:08:19,399
I found an old recording of Derma on

813
02:08:19,399 --> 02:08:22,090
MTV. I wonder what

814
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:54,579
it is.

815
02:08:54,579 --> 02:08:56,579
Hello, my honey. Hello, my

816
02:08:56,579 --> 02:08:58,579
ragtime girl.

817
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:00,579
Send me a kiss, my

818
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:03,270
baby, my heart's on fire.

819
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:05,770
If you lose me, baby,

820
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:07,770
you'll lose me. And you will have to

821
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:09,770
load and tell me, tell me

822
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:37,670
the lie. Hello,

823
02:09:37,670 --> 02:10:00,890
my honey. Damn.

824
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:02,890
That was some clean editing.

825
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:30,659
Derma goes to Mordor.

826
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:32,659
This is gonna be fucking loud.

827
02:10:32,659 --> 02:10:38,220
Hiya.

828
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:40,710
Turn them back off!

829
02:10:40,710 --> 02:10:44,170
My brothers!

830
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:46,170
We're going the wrong way.

831
02:10:46,170 --> 02:10:48,170
I see in your eyes

832
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:50,470
the same fear that would take the

833
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:53,539
heart of me.

834
02:10:53,539 --> 02:10:57,130
When the courage of men

835
02:10:57,130 --> 02:10:59,130
fails. When we forsake

836
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:01,130
our friends and break all bonds of

837
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,130
fellowship. But it is not this

838
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:05,130
day.

839
02:11:05,130 --> 02:11:07,130
An hour of woes

840
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:09,130
and shattered shields when the age of

841
02:11:09,130 --> 02:11:11,130
men comes crashing down.

842
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:13,130
But it is not this day!

843
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:15,130
This day we fight!

844
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:17,130
We have bees on this planet.

845
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:19,130
Think about what a bee does.

846
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:21,130
Think about what a bee does.

847
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:23,130
Hold on. Pause it.

848
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:25,130
Alright. That was so

849
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:27,130
stupid. It sucks. It's not even

850
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:29,130
funny. What? This is terrible.

851
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:31,130
You're a bad editor hand. You're ugly.

852
02:11:31,130 --> 02:11:33,130
I didn't say that. That's not true.

853
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:35,130
I didn't say that! Nothing about this is good.

854
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:37,130
That's not me. That's not me talking.

855
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:39,130
I don't think I'm gonna

856
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:41,130
skip this one. I hate this. This is terrible.

857
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:43,130
I don't know. This one's stupid.

858
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:45,130
Let's see what kind of a shot

859
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:47,130
you are, pilgrim. Take a crack at this bottle.

860
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:49,130
Let's see what...

861
02:11:49,130 --> 02:11:51,130
What?

862
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:53,130
I need to see that again. That honestly freaks

863
02:11:53,130 --> 02:11:55,130
me out. I was like what?

864
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:58,010
Why do I hear myself? My head.

865
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:00,010
An hour of woes.

866
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:02,010
This day we fight! We have bees on

867
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:04,010
this planet. Think about what a bee

868
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:06,010
does. Think about what a bee does.

869
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:08,010
Hold on. Pause it.

870
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:10,010
Alright. That was

871
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:12,010
something else you need to be aware of

872
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:14,180
is the balls here.

873
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:16,550
They're here.

874
02:12:16,550 --> 02:12:19,220
They didn't edit these out.

875
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:29,720
There's just funny balls here.

876
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:31,720
Alright. That was stupid.

877
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,720
It sucks. It's not even funny.

878
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:35,720
Person editing this is terrible.

879
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,720
You're a bad editor hand. You're ugly.

880
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,720
I didn't say that. That's not true. This is stupid.

881
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:41,720
I didn't say that! Nothing about this is good.

882
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,720
That's not me. Not one thing. I'm not...

883
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:45,720
I don't think I'm gonna

884
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:47,720
skip this one. I hate this. This is terrible.

885
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:49,720
I don't know. This one's stupid.

886
02:13:33,239 --> 02:13:35,239
Temporal up here.

887
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:37,239
Mario!

888
02:13:42,039 --> 02:13:52,649
Medic!

889
02:13:52,649 --> 02:13:55,140
Medic! Medic!

890
02:13:57,140 --> 02:14:05,340
How many times you joined a server

891
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,340
to realize there was nobody in it and you

892
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:09,340
just did that for like 10 minutes. You refused to leave.

893
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,340
Oh my god! What the fuck

894
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,340
was that? What was that ending?

895
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:15,340
What the hell?

896
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:17,340
Holy shit!

897
02:14:35,109 --> 02:14:37,109
I'm in trouble! I'm keeping an eye on you.

898
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:39,989
It's warming time!

899
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:41,989
Let's go!

900
02:14:41,989 --> 02:15:13,670
A rose!

901
02:15:13,670 --> 02:15:23,640
Oh.

902
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:30,939
It's warming time!

903
02:15:30,939 --> 02:15:35,479
Huh!

904
02:15:35,479 --> 02:15:38,550
Fucking Morpheus.

905
02:15:41,369 --> 02:15:46,229
Try again.

906
02:15:46,229 --> 02:15:49,300
Oh, these look so

907
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,300
good. They really are.

908
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:56,489
How are we doing? How are we? Good?

909
02:15:56,489 --> 02:15:58,489
Driving school? You can begin at any

910
02:15:58,489 --> 02:16:00,489
point. I'm gonna be paying a lot of attention

911
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:05,420
to what you're doing, by the way.

912
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:07,420
You can come out here and take a right.

913
02:16:07,420 --> 02:16:13,560
Easy on the gas. Easy. Hold it back.

914
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:16,819
A little on

915
02:16:16,819 --> 02:16:19,699
the gas there. You can

916
02:16:19,699 --> 02:16:23,289
get on the highway here. Stop.

917
02:16:23,289 --> 02:16:25,289
Slow down.

918
02:16:25,289 --> 02:16:30,539
I'm gonna have to take off a few points for that

919
02:16:30,539 --> 02:16:32,840
one. But you didn't signal.

920
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:34,840
You didn't signal when you went right and that's the first

921
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:36,840
thing that we're gonna do here. By the way, if you get

922
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:38,840
four or five points wrong here,

923
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:40,840
your license is not gonna come through.

924
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,340
And I am a stickler.

925
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,340
Very much so for these points.

926
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:47,829
Just keep that in mind.

927
02:16:47,829 --> 02:16:51,739
You can merge over here if you want.

928
02:16:54,229 --> 02:16:57,049
Slowly

929
02:16:57,049 --> 02:16:59,049
merge. Slowly merge.

930
02:16:59,049 --> 02:17:01,420
Way too fast.

931
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:03,909
Actually

932
02:17:03,909 --> 02:17:06,860
too fast. It's a very big

933
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:08,860
car. Yeah, that's why I have it.

934
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:10,860
Just making sure I can see what you're up to.

935
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:18,340
Could you pull this way

936
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:21,350
and park for me, please?

937
02:17:21,350 --> 02:17:23,350
This is the parallel parking part of the exam.

938
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:25,719
Over here, parallel parking

939
02:17:25,719 --> 02:17:27,719
this spot right here. There's two spots available.

940
02:17:27,719 --> 02:17:29,719
Not the one in front of the red truck. The one behind it.

941
02:17:31,719 --> 02:17:33,719
Behind the red truck.

942
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:36,020
Use your eyes.

943
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:38,200
Do you want these?

944
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:41,979
Do you want to put these on?

945
02:17:41,979 --> 02:17:43,979
I told you I was a stickler and I'm gonna be

946
02:17:43,979 --> 02:17:45,979
that. Get up there in parallel park.

947
02:17:45,979 --> 02:17:50,069
You hit it.

948
02:17:50,069 --> 02:17:52,069
You hit it. You bumped his

949
02:17:52,069 --> 02:17:56,420
bumper. Give me the wheel.

950
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:58,420
Let me show you how it's done. Here, you hold this.

951
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:00,420
Yeah, you grade me.

952
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:02,600
You grade me.

953
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:07,530
You go ahead and grade me.

954
02:18:07,530 --> 02:18:10,219
Put the gas on.

955
02:18:10,219 --> 02:18:13,159
This is how you do it.

956
02:18:13,159 --> 02:18:17,129
This is how you drive a goddamn car.

957
02:18:17,129 --> 02:18:19,129
You can go to sleep if you want. I got this.

958
02:18:19,129 --> 02:18:26,020
Very nice. Pull it in.

959
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:28,020
Parallel parking. This is how we parallel park.

960
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:30,020
Be careful.

961
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:32,020
Be careful. Be careful.

962
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:34,020
You mind?

963
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:36,020
Let me go.

964
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:38,020
Step on the gas.

965
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:40,629
Step on the brake.

966
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:42,870
Step on the gas again.

967
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:45,500
And we're in the spot.

968
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:49,020
How did I do, coach?

969
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:51,020
What did you put down for me? Did you give me an A?

970
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:53,020
Get out of the car.

971
02:18:53,020 --> 02:19:13,110
King Andy's evil reign

972
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:15,110
reaches far and wide.

973
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:17,110
He has obliterated his entire

974
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:19,110
bloodline for selfish gain

975
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:21,110
to be the true germite.

976
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:23,540
What he doesn't know is that there is

977
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:25,540
one left of his kind.

978
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:29,319
Who seeks revenge.

979
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,780
I'm not scared, though. Are you scared?

980
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:36,780
Yeah, I bet you are.

981
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:38,780
I bet you're scared.

982
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:40,780
I'm not scared at all.

983
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:44,149
Whoa, hey!

984
02:19:44,149 --> 02:19:46,579
Hey, you can see the whole park

985
02:19:46,579 --> 02:19:48,579
from here. Can you see?

986
02:19:48,579 --> 02:19:50,579
That's crazy.

987
02:19:50,579 --> 02:19:52,579
Hear thee, people of the parklands.

988
02:19:52,579 --> 02:19:54,579
There is a dangerous creature stalking

989
02:19:54,579 --> 02:19:56,579
the caves. Who is brave enough

990
02:19:56,579 --> 02:19:58,579
to kill the monster?

991
02:19:58,579 --> 02:20:00,579
Hello there, germite.

992
02:20:00,579 --> 02:20:02,579
You seem ready for a quest.

993
02:20:02,579 --> 02:20:04,579
No, no. No, I'm sorry.

994
02:20:04,579 --> 02:20:06,579
No, I ain't gonna do it. Are you sure

995
02:20:06,579 --> 02:20:08,579
you don't want to kill the monster?

996
02:20:08,579 --> 02:20:10,579
No, fuck you. Fucking hell.

997
02:20:10,579 --> 02:20:12,579
You see what I got dealing with back here?

998
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:14,579
You think I'm gonna do that shit? Well,

999
02:20:14,579 --> 02:20:16,579
this mission does progress the story.

1000
02:20:16,579 --> 02:20:18,579
How? Well, I don't know.

1001
02:20:18,579 --> 02:20:20,579
This is the starting mission. No.

1002
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:22,579
You do it. You go do it. You deal with

1003
02:20:22,579 --> 02:20:24,579
this. I'm not dealing with that. What are you talking about?

1004
02:20:24,579 --> 02:20:26,579
I may have caused it, but I'm not gonna deal with it.

1005
02:20:26,579 --> 02:20:28,579
Wait a minute. You put the monster in the cave

1006
02:20:28,579 --> 02:20:30,579
that's killed thousands of children?

1007
02:20:30,579 --> 02:20:32,579
Yes.

1008
02:20:32,579 --> 02:20:34,579
Jesus Christ.

1009
02:20:34,579 --> 02:20:36,579
Hey. How much?

1010
02:20:36,579 --> 02:20:38,579
Look, I'll just give you a potion. Can you please kill

1011
02:20:38,579 --> 02:20:40,579
the monster? Yes. I can tolerate

1012
02:20:40,579 --> 02:20:42,579
them when they're in small doses. Whatever. Just

1013
02:20:42,579 --> 02:20:44,579
take the potion, man. Thank you.

1014
02:20:48,579 --> 02:20:50,579
Oh my God!

1015
02:20:52,579 --> 02:20:54,579
No.

1016
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:02,120
No. Absolutely not.

1017
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:06,090
I want everyone to understand

1018
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:08,090
that the king made a lot of good

1019
02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:10,090
things happen today, don't you think?

1020
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:13,100
The jester over there, you're

1021
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,100
so funny. How do I do it?

1022
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:17,100
I made things happen. I raised taxes

1023
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,100
on everybody. How many people did we kill today?

1024
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:21,100
Sixty? Yeah.

1025
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:23,100
That's a lot. What'd you say?

1026
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,100
What'd you say?

1027
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:30,200
Feed him to the lions.

1028
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,200
Oh, Jerma's revenge on King Andy

1029
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,200
was sweet. He made one fatal

1030
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,200
error in skipping

1031
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,200
the first mission that your monster

1032
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:40,200
made its way to Jerma and hit him over the head

1033
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,200
with a big wooden mallet

1034
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,200
marking the end of the

1035
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,200
Jermite bloodline and paving

1036
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:48,200
way for the destruction of the

1037
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:51,530
world.

1038
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:56,020
Terrifying moments for a downtown Las Vegas

1039
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:58,020
homeowner who posted this video on

1040
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:00,020
social media showing the suspect

1041
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:02,020
making threats. The homeowner

1042
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:04,020
who we won't be identifying posted

1043
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:06,020
this on social media and asked her followers

1044
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:08,020
to share the video widely so

1045
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:10,020
people could be aware that the man

1046
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:12,020
is out there. At first,

1047
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:14,020
you can see the man just not making much

1048
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:16,020
sense, repeating himself.

1049
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:19,799
Could I come in?

1050
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:22,040
Could I come in your house?

1051
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,040
Could I come in? Yeah.

1052
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:26,649
Could I come in?

1053
02:22:26,649 --> 02:22:28,649
Let me in your house, please.

1054
02:22:28,649 --> 02:22:35,879
Could I come in?

1055
02:22:35,879 --> 02:22:37,879
Could I come in your house? This really happened?

1056
02:22:37,879 --> 02:22:43,430
Holy shit. It's terrifying.

1057
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:45,430
That is disturbing. Afterwards,

1058
02:22:45,430 --> 02:22:47,430
the man escalated things.

1059
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:51,340
Do you like drugs? Do you like drugs?

1060
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:53,700
I got a lot.

1061
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,700
Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.

1062
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:59,659
Bleed. Coke.

1063
02:22:59,659 --> 02:23:02,340
That's all I got.

1064
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:06,629
Let me in your house!

1065
02:23:06,629 --> 02:23:09,639
The post-lemon neighborhood

1066
02:23:09,639 --> 02:23:11,639
and people all over the valley

1067
02:23:11,639 --> 02:23:13,639
shaken. That man has since been

1068
02:23:13,639 --> 02:23:17,739
arrested. What the

1069
02:23:17,739 --> 02:23:19,739
fuck?

1070
02:23:19,739 --> 02:23:26,200
Jerma Ware, Incorporated.

1071
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:31,000
Oh!

1072
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I heard so many people use

1073
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,069
the hee-hee shit.

1074
02:23:36,069 --> 02:23:38,379
Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Super Mario.

1075
02:23:38,379 --> 02:23:41,770
So what does someone

1076
02:23:41,770 --> 02:23:43,770
look like? Okay, let me do some Mario stuff.

1077
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:47,930
Brian Griffith.

1078
02:23:47,930 --> 02:23:56,180
Yahoo! Uh-oh.

1079
02:23:56,180 --> 02:24:01,110
I hope I can keep the viewers.

1080
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:23,450
The caveman routine.

1081
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:26,709
I love it's only shown up twice.

1082
02:24:26,709 --> 02:24:33,500
Boy!

1083
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:35,500
Where's Luigi?

1084
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:37,500
Where's Luigi?

1085
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:39,500
God of the game.

1086
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:43,260
There's no way I fit in this thing.

1087
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:47,159
Where are you?

1088
02:24:47,159 --> 02:24:55,989
Absolutely terrible.

1089
02:24:55,989 --> 02:24:57,989
I learned this one when I was traveling.

1090
02:24:57,989 --> 02:25:03,879
Jerma and Danger.

1091
02:25:03,879 --> 02:25:13,860
Brod, right?

1092
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:24,620
My god!

1093
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:26,620
I'm going out to sea.

1094
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:44,969
Don't splash me!

1095
02:25:44,969 --> 02:25:46,969
Don't splash me! Throw him out!

1096
02:25:46,969 --> 02:25:48,969
He splashed me with water.

1097
02:25:48,969 --> 02:25:50,969
Don't splash me. Splashing.

1098
02:25:50,969 --> 02:25:52,969
You can't splash here. It says it on the sign

1099
02:25:52,969 --> 02:25:54,969
that you walked in. Don't splash people.

1100
02:25:54,969 --> 02:25:56,969
You don't want to splash

1101
02:25:56,969 --> 02:25:58,969
you fucking idiot.

1102
02:25:58,969 --> 02:26:02,100
I'm going to splash you.

1103
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:04,100
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1104
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:16,969
I'm getting

1105
02:26:16,969 --> 02:26:18,969
away from him.

1106
02:26:18,969 --> 02:26:21,909
Those of you that want to hear another song,

1107
02:26:21,909 --> 02:26:23,909
follow me, please.

1108
02:26:23,909 --> 02:26:28,459
It's not how you...

1109
02:26:28,459 --> 02:26:30,459
It's called the train tracks.

1110
02:26:30,459 --> 02:26:38,459
Going the wrong way.

1111
02:26:38,459 --> 02:26:40,459
Good. Good. I hit him in the fucking head.

1112
02:26:40,459 --> 02:26:43,590
I don't care.

1113
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:54,409
The accordion just sitting

1114
02:26:54,409 --> 02:27:07,399
in the water.

1115
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:24,219
Oh my god. Jesus.

1116
02:27:24,219 --> 02:27:28,120
Mario tells...

1117
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:30,120
Is this a hare?

1118
02:27:33,579 --> 02:27:38,739
Oh, boys and girls.

1119
02:27:38,739 --> 02:27:40,739
It's a me, Mario.

1120
02:27:40,739 --> 02:27:43,180
Let me tell you something.

1121
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:45,350
If somebody want to tell you to take

1122
02:27:45,350 --> 02:27:47,350
drugs, always

1123
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:49,350
say no. You see

1124
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:51,350
Luigi tried to drink

1125
02:27:51,350 --> 02:27:53,350
and do drugs one time. And I

1126
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:55,350
said no. And he said Mario.

1127
02:27:55,350 --> 02:27:57,350
And I said no.

1128
02:27:57,350 --> 02:27:59,350
Fucking god damn

1129
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:01,350
****. Let me tell you

1130
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:03,350
something about drugs and drugs.

1131
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:05,350
Oh no. You should never

1132
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:07,350
take any drugs. Never.

1133
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:09,350
Mario wouldn't. Luigi wouldn't.

1134
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:11,350
Totally.

1135
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:13,350
Maybe.

1136
02:28:13,350 --> 02:28:15,530
****.

1137
02:28:15,530 --> 02:28:17,530
****.

1138
02:28:17,530 --> 02:28:19,530
****.

1139
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:21,530
****.

1140
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:23,530
Get the **** out of here.

1141
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:25,530
Sit the ****

1142
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:27,530
down, Bowser.

1143
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:33,610
Bowser.

1144
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:37,829
It's

1145
02:28:37,829 --> 02:28:39,829
so stupid. It's jolly.

1146
02:28:39,829 --> 02:28:41,829
Your arms from side to side.

1147
02:28:41,829 --> 02:28:43,829
Come on, everyone. Go do

1148
02:28:43,829 --> 02:28:45,829
the Mario.

1149
02:28:45,829 --> 02:28:54,280
OK. You can do this, Mario.

1150
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:56,969
It's a me, Mario.

1151
02:28:56,969 --> 02:28:59,459
Let me tell you something

1152
02:28:59,459 --> 02:29:01,459
about drugs and alcohol.

1153
02:29:01,459 --> 02:29:04,090
My brother, Luigi, would also

1154
02:29:04,090 --> 02:29:06,090
say this too. We both

1155
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:08,090
would say this.

1156
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:10,090
****.

1157
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:12,090
No.

1158
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:14,090
No.

1159
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:16,090
How do you do it?

1160
02:29:16,090 --> 02:29:18,090
No.

1161
02:29:18,090 --> 02:29:20,969
She's looking at me like I'm fucking crazy.

1162
02:29:20,969 --> 02:29:22,969
She was.

1163
02:29:22,969 --> 02:29:24,969
I saw you laughing in the corner.

1164
02:29:24,969 --> 02:29:26,969
What's wrong?

1165
02:29:26,969 --> 02:29:28,969
What's wrong?

1166
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:32,170
Just cut

1167
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:34,170
them together, OK?

1168
02:29:34,170 --> 02:29:36,170
This job.

1169
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:53,819
It's a me, Mario.

1170
02:29:53,819 --> 02:29:55,819
I want to talk to you about drugs.

1171
02:29:55,819 --> 02:29:57,819
Boys and girls, don't do

1172
02:29:57,819 --> 02:29:59,819
drugs. You don't have to do them.

1173
02:29:59,819 --> 02:30:01,819
Don't feel pressured to take drugs

1174
02:30:01,819 --> 02:30:03,819
or drink. If anyone ever

1175
02:30:03,819 --> 02:30:05,819
pressures you, tell him Mario

1176
02:30:05,819 --> 02:30:07,819
said, so long, King Bowser.

1177
02:30:07,819 --> 02:30:09,819
And they will leave you alone.

1178
02:30:09,819 --> 02:30:11,819
No.

1179
02:30:11,819 --> 02:30:13,819
Hello.

1180
02:30:13,819 --> 02:30:15,819
It's a me, Mario.

1181
02:30:15,819 --> 02:30:17,819
I have to do a drug PSA.

1182
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:19,819
OK. I'm done.

1183
02:30:19,819 --> 02:30:23,530
Jesus.

1184
02:30:50,040 --> 02:31:15,430
Oh, ****.

1185
02:31:15,430 --> 02:31:19,079
Holy ****. That was good.

1186
02:31:19,079 --> 02:31:21,079
The duck story?

1187
02:31:21,079 --> 02:31:23,079
A duck

1188
02:31:23,079 --> 02:31:25,079
walked up to a lemonade stand

1189
02:31:25,079 --> 02:31:27,079
and he said to the man

1190
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:29,079
running the stand, hey

1191
02:31:29,079 --> 02:31:32,469
got any grapes?

1192
02:31:32,469 --> 02:31:36,379
The man said

1193
02:31:36,379 --> 02:31:40,219
What?

1194
02:31:40,219 --> 02:31:42,219
Then he waddled away

1195
02:31:42,219 --> 02:31:44,219
until the very next day

1196
02:31:44,219 --> 02:31:46,219
when the duck

1197
02:31:46,219 --> 02:31:48,219
walked up to the lemonade stand

1198
02:31:48,219 --> 02:31:50,219
and he said to the man

1199
02:31:50,219 --> 02:31:52,219
running the stand, hey

1200
02:31:52,219 --> 02:31:54,219
got any grapes?

1201
02:31:54,219 --> 02:31:58,739
The man said

1202
02:31:58,739 --> 02:32:01,180
Now **** you.

1203
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,520
I'm killing you.

1204
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:30,520
I don't care about anything else.

1205
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:32,520
I don't give a **** about anything else.

1206
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:35,780
The very next day.

1207
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:42,139
Here's the duck.

1208
02:32:42,139 --> 02:32:44,139
This is the duck's face.

1209
02:32:44,139 --> 02:32:46,139
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

1210
02:32:46,139 --> 02:32:48,139
And I can't imagine improving on what's already

1211
02:32:48,139 --> 02:32:50,139
my most used kitchen helper.

1212
02:32:50,139 --> 02:32:52,139
But I've heard improvement is exactly

1213
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:54,139
what's happened. And there's only one

1214
02:32:54,139 --> 02:32:56,139
person in the world who's qualified

1215
02:32:56,139 --> 02:32:58,139
to let us in on the news. So let's join

1216
02:32:58,139 --> 02:33:00,569
my friend, Jeremy Elbertson.

1217
02:33:00,569 --> 02:33:02,569
You're just a mean guy

1218
02:33:02,569 --> 02:33:04,569
who's got a bunch of TV shows.

1219
02:33:04,569 --> 02:33:06,569
You're just a mean guy who's got a bunch of TV shows

1220
02:33:06,569 --> 02:33:08,569
and I'm not going to stand for it.

1221
02:33:08,569 --> 02:33:13,239
Free me much from risotto

1222
02:33:13,239 --> 02:33:15,239
and you don't have a **** palette.

1223
02:33:15,239 --> 02:33:17,610
**** you.

1224
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:20,860
Shut up.

1225
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:22,860
Yeah.

1226
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:25,030
You're dumb.

1227
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:27,030
You're the dumbest one here.

1228
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:29,030
Turn that off.

1229
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:31,340
The smoke.

1230
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:36,969
So much smoke.

1231
02:33:36,969 --> 02:33:40,020
Where's the meat grinder?

1232
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:42,020
You're dead.

1233
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:48,489
This is Lucio

1234
02:33:48,489 --> 02:33:50,489
Malfoyle teaches the dark arts.

1235
02:33:50,489 --> 02:34:02,139
The defense of the dark arts class.

1236
02:34:02,139 --> 02:34:05,719
My name is Lucio

1237
02:34:05,719 --> 02:34:08,020
Malfoyle. I'm the new teacher in

1238
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:10,020
town.

1239
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:12,459
If we could all open up

1240
02:34:12,459 --> 02:34:14,459
your textbooks and go to page

1241
02:34:14,459 --> 02:34:16,459
200, please.

1242
02:34:16,459 --> 02:34:19,129
We're going to be using...

1243
02:34:19,129 --> 02:34:21,129
Yes, yes.

1244
02:34:21,129 --> 02:34:23,129
Page 200, we're going to be making a frog

1245
02:34:23,129 --> 02:34:26,200
breath potion. You know

1246
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:36,950
all about that? Open up your textbook.

1247
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:40,280
Wait, aren't I supposed to be Lucius?

1248
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:42,780
I'm in the middle

1249
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:44,780
of teaching, Harry. That's not the time

1250
02:34:44,780 --> 02:34:50,020
to use that spell.

1251
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:52,020
Oh, oh, I killed him.

1252
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:54,020
I think I killed him. Didn't they ever

1253
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:56,020
tell you you only use that

1254
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:58,020
spell if you mean to kill another wizard?

1255
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:00,780
Never use that

1256
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:02,780
spell. The book can tie his backwards.

1257
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:04,780
You can see the little slot.

1258
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:06,780
You're going to be floating in the air. There he is.

1259
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:11,049
Down.

1260
02:35:11,049 --> 02:35:13,049
He's swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around.

1261
02:35:13,049 --> 02:35:15,610
Down. Never use that spell

1262
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:21,370
in my classroom again.

1263
02:35:21,370 --> 02:35:23,370
Well, class, it's been a pleasure.

1264
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:25,370
Absolute pleasure. But you

1265
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:27,370
all don't

1266
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:29,370
understand the power of the Dark Lord.

1267
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:31,370
And for that reason, I'm out.

1268
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:33,540
Just like that show,

1269
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:41,989
Shark Tank. Dude, that's fail

1270
02:35:41,989 --> 02:35:43,989
RP. I'm calling an admin.

1271
02:35:43,989 --> 02:35:48,090
Yeah. Oh, nice

1272
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:50,649
one, Harry.

1273
02:35:50,649 --> 02:36:02,489
Almost got me.

1274
02:36:02,489 --> 02:36:05,879
Hey, Harry. See you tomorrow on

1275
02:36:05,879 --> 02:36:08,250
potions class.

1276
02:36:08,250 --> 02:36:11,000
Hahahaha.

1277
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,850
Hahahaha.

1278
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:20,010
I figured I was going to be flying.

1279
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:34,069
RDM.

1280
02:36:34,069 --> 02:36:36,069
Stop.

1281
02:36:36,069 --> 02:36:38,309
Criminal scum.

1282
02:36:38,309 --> 02:36:40,309
You violated the law.

1283
02:36:40,309 --> 02:36:42,620
You will pay in blood.

1284
02:36:42,620 --> 02:36:49,399
Let's go.

1285
02:36:49,399 --> 02:36:51,399
You're in trouble.

1286
02:36:51,399 --> 02:36:53,399
You're in trouble.

1287
02:36:53,399 --> 02:36:55,399
Stop.

1288
02:36:55,399 --> 02:36:57,399
Stop. Stop.

1289
02:36:57,399 --> 02:36:59,639
Stop.

1290
02:36:59,639 --> 02:37:01,639
Yes.

1291
02:37:01,639 --> 02:37:03,639
Yes.

1292
02:37:03,639 --> 02:37:11,000
Yes.

1293
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
You know, I kind of hope this is the only playlist aliens find

1294
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
in like a million years.

1295
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Don't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1296
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,299
That's what I hear. Shut up.

1297
02:37:19,299 --> 02:37:22,629
Shut up. Yeah.

1298
02:37:22,629 --> 02:37:24,629
Oh, yeah, yeah. Shut the fuck up.

1299
02:37:24,629 --> 02:37:26,940
Stupid. You're all stupid

1300
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:28,940
idiots.

1301
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:30,940
You're dumb.

1302
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:32,940
You're the dumbest one here.

1303
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:36,579
Yeah.

1304
02:37:36,579 --> 02:37:38,579
Turn that off. Turn that off. I'm shave Sean.

1305
02:37:38,579 --> 02:37:40,579
God damn it. I'm a different person now.

1306
02:37:40,579 --> 02:37:44,170
Turn that camera off. I learned this one when I

1307
02:37:44,170 --> 02:37:46,860
was traveling abroad.

1308
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:56,329
It's so true though. It really is.

1309
02:37:56,329 --> 02:37:58,329
Dude, I'll fall asleep with autoplay in a Karen

1310
02:37:58,329 --> 02:38:00,329
video. We'll just play. And then somebody gets punched.

1311
02:38:00,329 --> 02:38:22,090
Life feeling empty.

1312
02:38:22,090 --> 02:38:24,090
Is joy no where to be found.

1313
02:38:24,090 --> 02:38:26,090
You need yourself a brand new set of

1314
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:28,090
old tummy cowboy cookware.

1315
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:31,860
Look at that value.

1316
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:37,940
Order now.

1317
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:48,379
Getting on free.

1318
02:38:48,379 --> 02:38:55,799
It's warm

1319
02:38:55,799 --> 02:39:00,409
It's warm in time.

1320
02:39:00,409 --> 02:39:07,059
How do you feel? How are you

1321
02:39:07,059 --> 02:39:09,750
doing? Oh my God.

1322
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:18,709
Hello, patient. This is an ASI.

1323
02:39:18,709 --> 02:39:26,969
I can't do this.

1324
02:39:26,969 --> 02:39:29,459
How are you?

1325
02:39:29,459 --> 02:39:37,059
How are you feeling?

1326
02:39:37,059 --> 02:39:39,690
Hey.

1327
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:55,459
No. Mine.

1328
02:39:55,459 --> 02:39:59,989
Oh.

1329
02:39:59,989 --> 02:40:09,770
Oh. Oh.

1330
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:14,889
Jeans on. You're a found

1331
02:40:14,889 --> 02:40:49,129
footage. Uh oh.

1332
02:40:49,129 --> 02:40:51,129
Oh no.

1333
02:40:51,129 --> 02:40:54,649
Mario speedrun.

1334
02:40:54,649 --> 02:40:56,649
These are like my favorite by the way. I love these.

1335
02:40:56,649 --> 02:41:00,739
We did so much Mario

1336
02:41:00,739 --> 02:41:02,739
content. I'm so happy there's like

1337
02:41:02,739 --> 02:41:06,520
50 of these. 7 hours and

1338
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:08,520
15 minutes. Holy shit. Okay. Let's see what happens.

1339
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:20,540
I'm gonna burp.

1340
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:36,459
Okie dokie.

1341
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:47,659
Toaster goes in the

1342
02:41:47,659 --> 02:41:49,659
toaster. Toaster no.

1343
02:41:49,659 --> 02:41:51,659
Toaster goes in the toaster.

1344
02:41:51,659 --> 02:41:55,559
Bring your

1345
02:41:55,559 --> 02:41:59,909
arm.

1346
02:41:59,909 --> 02:42:01,909
Why would you do BLJs with 120

1347
02:42:01,909 --> 02:42:03,909
stars?

1348
02:42:03,909 --> 02:42:08,500
Fuck out of here.

1349
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:10,500
Fuck down Bowser.

1350
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:21,110
Flex yeah.

1351
02:42:21,110 --> 02:42:28,979
German 95 show.

1352
02:42:28,979 --> 02:42:58,229
On TV.

1353
02:42:58,229 --> 02:43:00,229
I'm on the television. Channel 2.

1354
02:43:00,229 --> 02:43:02,229
Bye.

1355
02:43:02,229 --> 02:43:04,600
Pasta tonight.

1356
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:06,600
Alright. Yeah. We're gonna play a new song.

1357
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:08,600
This one is something we've been working on for a long time.

1358
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:10,600
I hope you all enjoy it.

1359
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:12,600
It doesn't have a name. It's currently

1360
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:14,600
untitled so.

1361
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:16,600
That's what we're gonna do. It's an untitled song.

1362
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:18,600
And I hope you enjoy it.

1363
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:58,840
Oh. Please clap.

1364
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,489
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1365
02:44:02,489 --> 02:44:25,510
No. It was scary.

1366
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:27,510
Oh come on.

1367
02:44:27,510 --> 02:44:29,510
Bowser.

1368
02:44:29,510 --> 02:44:32,200
I know what to do.

1369
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:41,659
Tell you to take drugs.

1370
02:44:41,659 --> 02:44:43,659
Always say no.

1371
02:44:43,659 --> 02:44:45,659
My brother Luigi would also say this too.

1372
02:44:45,659 --> 02:44:47,659
We both would say this.

1373
02:44:47,659 --> 02:44:49,659
You don't have to do them. Don't get the pressure to take drugs

1374
02:44:49,659 --> 02:44:51,659
or drink. If anyone ever pressures you

1375
02:44:51,659 --> 02:44:53,659
tell them Mario said if you do drugs

1376
02:44:53,659 --> 02:44:55,659
you'll end up like Pikachu over there.

1377
02:45:04,739 --> 02:45:09,350
Somebody definitely got a bingo right now.

1378
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:12,040
You've been waiting for the Jojo

1379
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:16,889
intro. Bingo. Bingo.

1380
02:45:32,920 --> 02:46:16,889
Damn.

1381
02:46:16,889 --> 02:46:45,690
That was damn good.

1382
02:46:45,690 --> 02:46:53,540
It was.

1383
02:46:53,540 --> 02:47:04,680
Awesome.

1384
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:06,680
All of these have been absolute

1385
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:10,969
complete bangers.

1386
02:47:10,969 --> 02:47:14,870
Do not plank the blank.

1387
02:47:14,870 --> 02:47:21,909
Okay. I'll voice the subtitle.

1388
02:47:21,909 --> 02:47:23,909
Records of the simulation of the target's memory.

1389
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:25,909
Advise watch with at least three trained

1390
02:47:25,909 --> 02:47:27,909
agents. Watcher must avoid...

1391
02:47:27,909 --> 02:47:30,729
Okay. I'll do it.

1392
02:47:30,729 --> 02:47:33,420
Oh my fucking

1393
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:35,420
god. I thought that was in real life.

1394
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,360
Was that in real life? What the fuck? That was in real life.

1395
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:41,430
Why?

1396
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:47,000
Was that in real life?

1397
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:51,610
Okay. What the? Come on.

1398
02:47:51,610 --> 02:47:53,610
Jesus. Oh my god.

1399
02:47:53,610 --> 02:48:02,250
Stop doing that.

1400
02:48:02,250 --> 02:48:09,719
Stop it.

1401
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:30,360
Turn on captions?

1402
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:34,360
I think we can hear it.

1403
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:52,200
Should I do it?

1404
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:56,549
I'm about to turn off the TV.

1405
02:49:10,549 --> 02:49:12,549
People are too high for this.

1406
02:49:12,549 --> 02:49:16,579
Oh.

1407
02:49:22,579 --> 02:49:25,780
It's ruining the video.

1408
02:49:25,780 --> 02:49:27,780
God damn it. No.

1409
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:36,280
Who's knocking at this time?

1410
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:38,280
I gotta calm down.

1411
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:42,819
That was just a dream.

1412
02:49:42,819 --> 02:49:46,860
I am coming. Sorry. You can come back tomorrow.

1413
02:49:46,860 --> 02:49:50,760
Maybe. Maybe next time.

1414
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:54,219
What a weird guy. What the fuck?

1415
02:49:54,219 --> 02:49:57,989
Wait. Hold on. I feel like I've

1416
02:49:57,989 --> 02:50:01,510
seen that guy before. I'm keeping all

1417
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:03,510
my lights on tonight. I'm keeping the

1418
02:50:03,510 --> 02:50:07,350
lights on.

1419
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:09,979
What the fuck is that noise?

1420
02:50:09,979 --> 02:50:11,979
Someone trying to break in. I'm leaving this fucking

1421
02:50:11,979 --> 02:50:14,860
house right now.

1422
02:50:14,860 --> 02:50:19,829
I need to get the fuck out of here.

1423
02:50:19,829 --> 02:50:33,450
You got me.

1424
02:50:33,450 --> 02:50:35,819
That was very well made, by the way.

1425
02:50:35,819 --> 02:50:41,129
NeuroStory pizza floor.

1426
02:50:41,129 --> 02:50:43,879
What is it? German? NeuroStory pizza

1427
02:50:43,879 --> 02:50:49,770
floor, chef.

1428
02:50:49,770 --> 02:51:10,870
Baseball ass.

1429
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:13,620
Hi, boys and girls. I'm Jeremy Alphaxson.

1430
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:15,930
I have to reel it in

1431
02:51:15,930 --> 02:51:17,930
in 2022.

1432
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:19,930
You know, it's not Yahoo. True.

1433
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:21,930
It's not cool. Baseball

1434
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:25,000
ass.

1435
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:33,559
I feel like I hit my head.

1436
02:51:33,559 --> 02:51:38,549
Is that the law and order sound?

1437
02:51:38,549 --> 02:51:50,969
What's happening?

1438
02:51:50,969 --> 02:51:54,809
Where am I?

1439
02:51:54,809 --> 02:51:57,559
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1440
02:51:57,559 --> 02:52:01,399
Hi, Bob.

1441
02:52:01,399 --> 02:52:04,280
Hey, Bob. I'm on TV. I'm sorry.

1442
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:06,280
I'm sorry. Can I have the mic?

1443
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:08,280
No, you don't have to do that.

1444
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:15,239
Channel 2.

1445
02:52:15,239 --> 02:52:26,809
I'll leave. I'll leave.

1446
02:52:26,809 --> 02:52:30,010
Funny stuff. You did this.

1447
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:33,340
You did this.

1448
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:35,340
And you can fix it too.

1449
02:52:35,340 --> 02:52:42,360
You're a real piece of work.

1450
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:44,600
You know what? I can't even

1451
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:46,600
say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.

1452
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:49,590
I was going to say

1453
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:55,420
forget me.

1454
02:52:55,420 --> 02:52:58,680
So stupid.

1455
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:21,020
God damn it. German auto

1456
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:32,280
C adventure.

1457
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:37,270
They're going to think I'm crazy.

1458
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:39,270
Don't splash people.

1459
02:53:43,829 --> 02:53:49,020
Yes.

1460
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:51,020
Terminati.

1461
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:53,020
Thank you.

1462
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:59,670
Good.

1463
02:53:59,670 --> 02:54:01,670
Hit him in the head. I don't care.

1464
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:15,000
Oh, my God.

1465
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:19,219
What I get.

1466
02:54:19,219 --> 02:54:22,860
Oh, that's a big

1467
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:24,860
one. I'll take a picture of that.

1468
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:30,100
I'll get one more out there.

1469
02:54:39,959 --> 02:54:42,200
What was that?

1470
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:44,200
What the fuck was that?

1471
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:46,200
We play at night. We stalk at night.

1472
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:48,200
We're the rats.

1473
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:50,200
What the? I don't know what that was,

1474
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:52,200
but it was weird. I'm the giant

1475
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,200
rat that makes all of

1476
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:56,200
the rules. You want to duel?

1477
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:58,200
You and me.

1478
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,450
Come on. Easy. Easy.

1479
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:07,450
Come on. Do it already. Come on. Come at me.

1480
02:55:12,819 --> 02:55:14,819
What the hell was that?

1481
02:55:14,819 --> 02:55:25,690
Auto.

1482
02:55:25,690 --> 02:55:31,430
Look at auto. That one was great.

1483
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:59,340
What's your name?

1484
02:55:59,340 --> 02:56:03,690
That's so horrifying.

1485
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:15,770
What's your name?

1486
02:56:15,770 --> 02:56:20,250
Quiet.

1487
02:56:20,250 --> 02:56:22,250
Here comes the car.

1488
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:24,250
You're dumb?

1489
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:26,250
You're the dumbest one here.

1490
02:56:26,250 --> 02:56:30,469
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1491
02:56:30,469 --> 02:56:33,100
Shut the fuck up.

1492
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:35,100
Those pants. Hey, are you ready?

1493
02:56:35,100 --> 02:56:37,100
Follow me up to the office and they'll

1494
02:56:37,100 --> 02:56:39,850
finish your release.

1495
02:56:39,850 --> 02:56:41,850
Fuck you. Fucking hell. You see what I got

1496
02:56:41,850 --> 02:56:57,659
dealing with back here?

1497
02:56:57,659 --> 02:56:59,659
You were talking about me and my kingdom.

1498
02:56:59,659 --> 02:57:01,659
Just a little too, a little too harsh.

1499
02:57:01,659 --> 02:57:04,020
I don't like

1500
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:06,389
you much.

1501
02:57:06,389 --> 02:57:09,459
This was welded with

1502
02:57:09,459 --> 02:57:11,459
dragon bone. I really don't

1503
02:57:11,459 --> 02:57:13,459
want you around here. You want to duel?

1504
02:57:13,459 --> 02:57:15,459
You and me. Dragon

1505
02:57:15,459 --> 02:57:17,459
bone steel. You don't deserve

1506
02:57:17,459 --> 02:57:20,149
to live.

1507
02:57:42,809 --> 02:57:45,110
Hey, look, bud. I'm an engineer.

1508
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:47,110
That means I solve problems.

1509
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:49,110
I solve practical problems.

1510
02:57:49,110 --> 02:57:51,479
Teleporter going up.

1511
02:57:51,479 --> 02:57:56,200
Ow.

1512
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:59,020
My leg. Mission begins

1513
02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:04,389
in the century. Going up.

1514
02:58:04,389 --> 02:58:09,510
Good night, Irene.

1515
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:20,069
You know, building centuries

1516
02:58:20,069 --> 02:58:22,069
sure is tough work. A lot of people

1517
02:58:22,069 --> 02:58:24,069
don't realize the amount of

1518
02:58:24,069 --> 02:58:26,069
craftsmanship that goes into making one

1519
02:58:26,069 --> 02:58:28,069
of these things. You need the right kind of aluminum

1520
02:58:28,069 --> 02:58:30,069
alloy metal. That takes a while to get

1521
02:58:30,069 --> 02:58:32,069
and it's very stressful. Look at that. You got all

1522
02:58:32,069 --> 02:58:34,069
kinds of scouts fucking with you. Can't you see

1523
02:58:34,069 --> 02:58:36,069
how busy I am right now?

1524
02:58:36,069 --> 02:58:39,530
Sensor down.

1525
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:45,030
Ah.

1526
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:51,049
Victory.

1527
02:58:51,049 --> 02:59:00,899
Hey. Hey, what's up? How are you?

1528
02:59:00,899 --> 02:59:04,299
I just moved in. Yep. New to

1529
02:59:04,299 --> 02:59:06,729
the neighborhood. Me. I love your

1530
02:59:06,729 --> 02:59:09,290
house. I love what you're doing here.

1531
02:59:09,290 --> 02:59:11,290
You know what I mean? I love this house. What's that?

1532
02:59:11,290 --> 02:59:13,530
Really, really beautiful lawn you have,

1533
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:15,829
too. Yeah. I got kids.

1534
02:59:15,829 --> 02:59:18,139
Yeah, we all get kids, right?

1535
02:59:18,139 --> 02:59:20,139
Look, if you ever, um,

1536
02:59:20,139 --> 02:59:22,139
it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out

1537
02:59:22,139 --> 02:59:24,139
and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever,

1538
02:59:24,139 --> 02:59:26,139
we have to get the families together.

1539
02:59:26,139 --> 02:59:28,139
Like, I would just come over. I would come over. I would come in

1540
02:59:28,139 --> 02:59:30,139
your house. I would come over your house.

1541
02:59:30,139 --> 02:59:32,139
And you'd let me in, right? Like, I would

1542
02:59:32,139 --> 02:59:34,139
come over. We'd do a thing. Would you be interested?

1543
02:59:34,139 --> 02:59:36,440
Okay.

1544
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:38,440
Okay.

1545
02:59:38,440 --> 02:59:40,440
Can get some mojitos.

1546
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:42,440
It's like a purge movie.

1547
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:44,440
You don't understand. It's so good.

1548
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:46,440
You know the trick for a mojito?

1549
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:48,440
Extra mint.

1550
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:50,440
People don't like

1551
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:52,440
the taste of mint usually. Can I come in?

1552
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:55,190
Can I just come in?

1553
02:59:55,190 --> 02:59:57,190
Okay. Yeah, but I mean, I could show you how to make a mojito

1554
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:59,190
the right way and not like

1555
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:01,190
the way that everybody else makes it without the extra mint.

1556
03:00:01,190 --> 03:00:03,190
I have to come in though. Can I come in your house?

1557
03:00:42,520 --> 03:00:45,530
Nice netcode.

1558
03:00:45,530 --> 03:00:47,530
Anybody else have something to say?

1559
03:00:47,530 --> 03:00:55,850
Very interesting.

1560
03:00:55,850 --> 03:01:00,059
Are you ready? Yeah.

1561
03:01:18,489 --> 03:01:30,329
God.

1562
03:01:30,329 --> 03:01:34,100
They put something in it to make you forget.

1563
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:36,469
I don't even remember how I got here.

1564
03:01:36,469 --> 03:01:38,469
I've been drinking water out of the sink.

1565
03:01:38,469 --> 03:01:40,469
This whole time.

1566
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:42,469
Like, literally like drinking the toilet.

1567
03:01:42,469 --> 03:01:44,469
Like the water in the toilet.

1568
03:01:44,469 --> 03:01:46,469
They have like a water thing

1569
03:01:46,469 --> 03:01:48,469
here.

1570
03:01:48,469 --> 03:01:56,149
Like in the other room.

1571
03:01:56,149 --> 03:01:59,610
Sure. You're a scientist.

1572
03:01:59,610 --> 03:02:02,680
Pick up that can.

1573
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:04,680
I said pick up the can.

1574
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:06,680
I'm something of a scientist myself.

1575
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:08,680
You have no compliance with it.

1576
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:14,840
Whoa!

1577
03:02:18,229 --> 03:02:22,069
This water is

1578
03:02:22,069 --> 03:02:24,069
so dirty.

1579
03:02:24,069 --> 03:02:26,069
Don't splash me.

1580
03:02:26,069 --> 03:02:28,069
Don't splash me.

1581
03:02:28,069 --> 03:02:30,069
Throw him out.

1582
03:02:35,450 --> 03:02:41,719
I love your house.

1583
03:02:41,719 --> 03:02:43,719
I love what you do in here.

1584
03:02:47,180 --> 03:02:52,170
I didn't do it.

1585
03:02:52,170 --> 03:02:54,170
Really, really beautiful lawn you have.

1586
03:02:54,170 --> 03:03:04,729
Good. Stop.

1587
03:03:04,729 --> 03:03:08,120
Slow down.

1588
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:10,120
I'm going to have to take off a few points without

1589
03:03:10,120 --> 03:03:15,819
what that was.

1590
03:03:15,819 --> 03:03:17,819
Stop sign. Stop sign.

1591
03:03:17,819 --> 03:03:19,819
Stop sign.

1592
03:03:19,819 --> 03:03:21,819
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.

1593
03:03:21,819 --> 03:03:23,819
Stop sign. Stop sign.

1594
03:03:23,819 --> 03:03:27,979
Do you see what's in front of us?

1595
03:03:27,979 --> 03:03:29,979
You do, right? What's in front of us?

1596
03:03:29,979 --> 03:03:40,090
You're pretty dumb.

1597
03:03:40,090 --> 03:03:42,090
Can I just tell you? You're dumb.

1598
03:03:42,090 --> 03:03:44,090
What was that? No human drives a car

1599
03:03:44,090 --> 03:03:46,090
like this. I hate coming out here

1600
03:03:46,090 --> 03:03:48,090
with bugs everywhere. I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.

1601
03:03:50,579 --> 03:03:52,579
I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.

1602
03:03:52,579 --> 03:03:55,139
But, dude, is

1603
03:03:55,139 --> 03:03:57,139
there something on me? Is there something on my back?

1604
03:03:57,139 --> 03:03:59,139
Is there something on my back? Just tell me. Get it.

1605
03:03:59,139 --> 03:04:01,139
Get it. Get it. Dude, get it.

1606
03:04:01,139 --> 03:04:03,139
By don't move, it won't

1607
03:04:03,139 --> 03:04:06,920
see me. Clear!

1608
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:15,180
Sent her down!

1609
03:04:15,180 --> 03:04:17,180
You got something to say?

1610
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:30,729
That was awesome.

1611
03:04:30,729 --> 03:04:33,420
That was fucking awesome.

1612
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:35,420
Germa and the Germas.

1613
03:04:35,420 --> 03:04:37,420
Untitled bug song.

1614
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:43,299
We got another band video. People are utilizing

1615
03:04:43,299 --> 03:04:45,299
the driving instructor very well.

1616
03:04:45,299 --> 03:04:52,600
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

1617
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:55,209
Thanks for coming out. Yeah.

1618
03:04:55,209 --> 03:04:57,209
We got a new song that we're going to play for you here.

1619
03:04:57,209 --> 03:05:02,200
I think I just dropped a jam out of my pocket.

1620
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:04,200
Maybe I should trade this.

1621
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:06,200
Alright, yeah. We're going to play a new song.

1622
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:08,200
This one is something we've been working on for a long time.

1623
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:10,200
I hope you all enjoy it.

1624
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:12,200
It doesn't have a name. It's currently untitled.

1625
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:14,200
So, that's what

1626
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:16,200
we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I hope you enjoy it.

1627
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:18,440
Maybe you can help us come up with a title

1628
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:20,440
after the end of the show.

1629
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:23,260
It's going to be peppy. It's going to be a lot of upbeat.

1630
03:05:23,260 --> 03:05:25,260
So, hopefully see somebody out there dancing.

1631
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:28,649
Okay? And a one,

1632
03:05:28,649 --> 03:05:30,649
two, a one, two, three,

1633
03:05:30,649 --> 03:05:35,510
four. Uh-oh.

1634
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:56,629
Here we go.

1635
03:05:56,629 --> 03:05:58,629
Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.

1636
03:05:58,629 --> 03:06:00,629
Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.

1637
03:06:00,629 --> 03:06:02,629
Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.

1638
03:06:02,629 --> 03:06:04,629
Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.

1639
03:06:04,629 --> 03:07:01,399
That was crazy.

1640
03:07:01,399 --> 03:07:04,409
The songs have been

1641
03:07:04,409 --> 03:07:06,409
just so good.

1642
03:07:06,409 --> 03:07:09,219
They've been fantastic.

1643
03:07:31,270 --> 03:07:36,579
Walking through the woods.

1644
03:07:36,579 --> 03:07:42,090
Is this another real one?

1645
03:07:42,090 --> 03:08:31,430
With real actors?

1646
03:08:31,430 --> 03:09:05,020
Oh my god.

1647
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:08,090
This is terrifying.

1648
03:09:08,090 --> 03:09:10,090
This show is brought to you by Grotto Beasts.

1649
03:09:10,090 --> 03:09:12,090
The exciting new trading card

1650
03:09:12,090 --> 03:09:14,090
game coming soon.

1651
03:09:14,090 --> 03:09:16,090
And now, a word from our

1652
03:09:16,090 --> 03:09:18,260
sponsors.

1653
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:23,700
Are you ready?

1654
03:09:23,700 --> 03:09:26,260
Road Wireless Goes.

1655
03:09:26,260 --> 03:09:28,260
These things are fucking awesome.

1656
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:30,260
They're so little.

1657
03:09:30,260 --> 03:09:32,260
You get two.

1658
03:09:32,260 --> 03:09:34,260
You can plug other shit into here too.

1659
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:37,979
This is a scientist.

1660
03:09:37,979 --> 03:09:39,979
This is a real scientist.

1661
03:09:39,979 --> 03:09:41,979
This is a real scientist working

1662
03:09:41,979 --> 03:09:43,979
as a senior scientist at Road

1663
03:09:43,979 --> 03:09:45,979
Laboratories.

1664
03:09:45,979 --> 03:09:47,979
We at Road Laboratories A,

1665
03:09:47,979 --> 03:09:49,979
to deliver the best possible microphone

1666
03:09:49,979 --> 03:09:51,979
experience for all gamers.

03:09:51,979 --> 03:09:53,979
We use the latest high-tech

1668
03:09:53,979 --> 03:09:55,979
equipment to assure the Wireless

1670
03:09:57,979 --> 03:09:59,979
usability and comfort such as

1671
03:09:59,979 --> 03:10:01,979
shock absorbency.

1672
03:10:01,979 --> 03:10:03,979
I'm gonna scream in your ears.

1673
03:10:03,979 --> 03:10:06,149
Hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1674
03:10:06,149 --> 03:10:08,149
Noise compression.

1675
03:10:08,149 --> 03:10:10,149
And fashion.

1676
03:10:10,149 --> 03:10:12,149
All combined to give you the clearest,

1677
03:10:12,149 --> 03:10:14,149
pleasing sound possible.

1678
03:10:14,149 --> 03:10:16,649
But wait.

1679
03:10:16,649 --> 03:10:18,649
I know you're probably asking.

1680
03:10:18,649 --> 03:10:20,649
How much?

1681
03:10:20,649 --> 03:10:22,649
For the low low price of three money.

1682
03:10:22,649 --> 03:10:24,649
Wow!

1683
03:10:24,649 --> 03:10:26,649
Of course, I don't hate microphones.

1684
03:10:26,649 --> 03:10:28,649
I like microphones if they're

1685
03:10:28,649 --> 03:10:30,649
Road Wireless Go

1686
03:10:30,649 --> 03:10:32,649
2. The best microphones.

1687
03:10:32,649 --> 03:10:35,209
Am I okay?

1688
03:10:35,209 --> 03:10:56,379
Besides the fact that

1689
03:10:56,379 --> 03:10:58,680
first, be aware.

1690
03:11:11,770 --> 03:11:14,069
Hey, are you ready?

1691
03:11:14,069 --> 03:11:16,889
Are you ready? You don't look ready.

1692
03:11:16,889 --> 03:11:20,329
You know, this was welded

1693
03:11:20,329 --> 03:11:28,459
with Dragonbone.

1694
03:11:28,459 --> 03:11:31,590
Oh shit, okay, yep.

1695
03:11:31,590 --> 03:11:34,920
Something so simple as to go to a hotel room.

1696
03:11:34,920 --> 03:12:04,680
Two, three,

1697
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:11,780
two, three,

1698
03:12:11,780 --> 03:12:14,659
two, three,

1699
03:12:14,659 --> 03:12:17,610
three!

1700
03:12:17,610 --> 03:12:22,219
Yeah, yeah, I'm up.

1701
03:12:22,219 --> 03:12:32,899
What's that on TV?

1702
03:12:32,899 --> 03:12:35,399
Oh shit!

1703
03:12:35,399 --> 03:12:37,399
It's fast German purple alien.

1704
03:12:37,399 --> 03:12:41,989
German purple alien.

1705
03:12:41,989 --> 03:12:44,360
Hey!

1706
03:12:44,360 --> 03:12:48,139
Hey!

1707
03:12:48,139 --> 03:12:51,850
Put it all again, Steve.

1708
03:12:51,850 --> 03:12:53,850
Why does that scare me so much?

1709
03:12:53,850 --> 03:12:55,850
To which we added the world's finest

1710
03:12:55,850 --> 03:12:57,850
resort facilities, a spectacular

1711
03:12:57,850 --> 03:12:59,850
amusement park, and succulent

1712
03:12:59,850 --> 03:13:01,850
seafood.

1713
03:13:01,850 --> 03:13:04,540
If you ever pressure, drugs,

1714
03:13:04,540 --> 03:13:06,540
alcohol, anything naughty

1715
03:13:06,540 --> 03:13:08,540
at all, say no.

1716
03:13:08,540 --> 03:13:25,799
Uh oh. Wait, what?

1717
03:13:25,799 --> 03:13:28,680
I have to choose it?

1718
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:30,680
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, I have to actually choose

1719
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:33,620
the video. Okay, hold on. I don't want

1720
03:13:33,620 --> 03:13:37,079
to spoil this. I gotta make sure I keep my place

1721
03:13:37,079 --> 03:13:40,840
here. I'm going yes. Hold on. I don't want

1722
03:13:40,840 --> 03:13:42,840
to spoil anything, but I don't want to lose my

1723
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:56,950
place. One sec. Okay.

1724
03:13:56,950 --> 03:14:05,139
This is yes.

1725
03:14:05,139 --> 03:14:23,940
Alright!

1726
03:14:23,940 --> 03:14:29,770
Okay!

1727
03:14:29,770 --> 03:14:32,329
What? Oh, okay.

1728
03:14:32,329 --> 03:14:44,600
Alright, let's see what no is.

1729
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:52,540
So this is no.

1730
03:15:23,299 --> 03:15:27,399
Oh my god.

1731
03:15:27,399 --> 03:15:32,010
What is that picture even from?

1732
03:15:32,010 --> 03:15:34,250
What's that picture from?

1733
03:15:34,250 --> 03:15:41,780
This one here. Is that even my face?

1734
03:15:41,780 --> 03:15:47,159
I don't even think this is my face.

1735
03:15:47,159 --> 03:15:59,370
Go on up next. He's logged into second

1736
03:15:59,370 --> 03:16:01,370
German, not the main channel.

1737
03:16:07,049 --> 03:16:09,049
You violated the law.

1738
03:16:09,049 --> 03:16:21,139
Finally, somebody has the lightsaber.

1739
03:16:21,139 --> 03:16:23,450
Guilty gear strive

1740
03:16:23,450 --> 03:16:25,450
German DLC.

1741
03:17:03,270 --> 03:17:05,270
It's woman's rights.

1742
03:17:51,739 --> 03:17:55,829
German F5 eye-witness museum intro.

1743
03:17:55,829 --> 03:17:59,540
What the hell is this?

1744
03:17:59,540 --> 03:18:26,170
Oh my god.

1745
03:18:26,170 --> 03:18:30,459
That was amazing.

1746
03:18:30,459 --> 03:18:32,889
Hold on a second here.

1747
03:18:32,889 --> 03:18:35,450
Cartwheel Jerma and Orange Troglodyte battle

1748
03:18:35,450 --> 03:18:39,799
for the origin mirror. This is a shortened

1749
03:18:39,799 --> 03:18:41,799
fight scene from a longer video. It's from a

1750
03:18:41,799 --> 03:18:43,799
dumb meme series I've run over the last two

1751
03:18:43,799 --> 03:18:45,799
years called Cartwheel Jerma

1752
03:18:45,799 --> 03:18:48,620
and, yep, wait, hold on.

1753
03:18:48,620 --> 03:18:55,659
This is the, oh, this is the spinoff.

1754
03:18:55,659 --> 03:18:57,659
Right, this is the spinoff series

1755
03:18:57,659 --> 03:18:59,829
from Fast Jerma and Purple Alien.

1756
03:18:59,829 --> 03:19:09,540
Well, let's see.

1757
03:19:11,540 --> 03:19:13,540
What the?

1758
03:19:25,270 --> 03:19:27,270
What the?

1759
03:19:42,250 --> 03:19:47,100
Holy shit.

1760
03:19:47,100 --> 03:20:42,389
God damn.

1761
03:20:42,389 --> 03:21:14,139
Gonna need a health potion after

1762
03:21:14,139 --> 03:21:16,139
that one.

1763
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:24,600
Holy shit.

1764
03:21:47,510 --> 03:21:59,020
Holy shit.

1765
03:21:59,020 --> 03:22:01,020
Oh my god, that was

1766
03:22:01,020 --> 03:22:12,860
fucking believable. That truly

1767
03:22:12,860 --> 03:22:16,059
was remarkable. Nice fucking

1768
03:22:16,059 --> 03:22:18,059
job. Holy smokes.

1769
03:22:18,059 --> 03:22:23,930
I tell you, when

1770
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:27,450
we do Encore Night, well,

1771
03:22:27,450 --> 03:22:30,780
part two or whatever, we're gonna have to check out

1772
03:22:30,780 --> 03:22:33,399
some more of the Cartwheel Jerma

1773
03:22:33,399 --> 03:22:37,739
series. That was awesome. Good show.

1774
03:23:12,139 --> 03:23:14,819
No human drives a car

1775
03:23:14,819 --> 03:23:16,819
like this. No human.

1776
03:23:16,819 --> 03:23:18,819
You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably

1777
03:23:18,819 --> 03:23:20,819
do better than the test than you did.

1778
03:23:20,819 --> 03:23:23,059
Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right?

1779
03:23:23,059 --> 03:23:25,059
What's in front of us?

1780
03:23:25,059 --> 03:23:27,059
Stop sign, stop sign, stop sign, stop sign.

1781
03:23:27,059 --> 03:23:30,389
Keep going.

1782
03:23:30,389 --> 03:23:32,389
Over here, parallel park in this spot

1783
03:23:32,389 --> 03:23:34,389
right here. There's two spots available. Not the one

1784
03:23:34,389 --> 03:23:36,389
in front of the red truck. The one behind it.

1785
03:23:36,389 --> 03:23:39,340
Behind the red truck.

1786
03:23:39,340 --> 03:23:41,899
Use your eyes.

1787
03:23:41,899 --> 03:23:44,579
Do you want these? Right there,

1788
03:23:44,579 --> 03:23:46,579
parallel park behind the red truck.

1789
03:23:46,579 --> 03:23:48,579
I'm not gonna say it another time.

1790
03:23:48,579 --> 03:23:50,579
Get up there in parallel park.

1791
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:54,299
You just hit, you hit

1792
03:23:54,299 --> 03:23:56,299
it. You hit it. You bumped his

1793
03:23:56,299 --> 03:23:58,299
bumper. Okay.

1794
03:23:58,299 --> 03:24:01,559
That's gonna get you two grades off, I think.

1795
03:24:01,559 --> 03:24:03,559
You're not getting your license today, by the way.

1796
03:24:03,559 --> 03:24:06,180
That very clear.

1797
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:08,180
We sat down?

1798
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:11,450
My name is

1799
03:24:11,450 --> 03:24:15,850
Sean, okay? That's what you

1800
03:24:15,850 --> 03:24:17,850
can call me now. Not angry

1801
03:24:17,850 --> 03:24:19,850
mustache guy that you see on

1802
03:24:19,850 --> 03:24:23,420
YouTube. Sean.

1803
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:25,420
I'm very sorry. I'm incredibly

1804
03:24:25,420 --> 03:24:29,770
sorry. You want more than that?

1805
03:24:29,770 --> 03:24:32,389
That's all I'm gonna give you. I'm gonna go back

1806
03:24:32,389 --> 03:24:34,389
to being a good person. You just

1807
03:24:34,389 --> 03:24:36,760
wait. Good person Sean is

1808
03:24:36,760 --> 03:24:38,760
what you'll call me. Not this. I'm shaving

1809
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:40,760
this. Good person Sean is coming

1810
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:50,040
up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1811
03:24:50,040 --> 03:24:52,600
That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut

1812
03:24:52,600 --> 03:24:55,159
up. Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

1813
03:24:55,159 --> 03:24:58,229
Shut the fuck up. Stupid.

1814
03:24:58,229 --> 03:25:00,229
You're all stupid idiots.

1815
03:25:00,229 --> 03:25:02,469
You're dumb?

1816
03:25:02,469 --> 03:25:04,709
You're the dumbest one here. Yeah.

1817
03:25:04,709 --> 03:25:08,360
No, no, no, no. Turn that off.

1818
03:25:08,360 --> 03:25:10,360
Turn that off. I'm shaved Sean, god

1819
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:12,360
damn it. No, I'm a different person now. Turn that camera

1820
03:25:12,360 --> 03:25:16,780
off. Somebody used it. Somebody actually

1821
03:25:16,780 --> 03:25:18,780
used it.

1822
03:25:18,780 --> 03:25:52,440
Dude, I just got

1823
03:25:52,440 --> 03:25:54,440
a warning on my Twitch dashboard

1824
03:25:54,440 --> 03:25:56,440
that said there's a copyrighted song.

1825
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:59,319
That's what triggered it. This whole stream.

1826
03:25:59,319 --> 03:26:29,379
Oh my god.

1827
03:26:29,379 --> 03:26:31,379
Alright, time for another pee break. I'm gonna get a drink.

1828
03:26:31,379 --> 03:26:34,389
I'll be back in like two minutes, three minutes.

1829
03:26:34,389 --> 03:26:37,079
I think we are, we're getting

1830
03:26:37,079 --> 03:26:39,079
close to a little bit more than the halfway point.

1831
03:26:39,079 --> 03:26:42,020
I think a little bit more than that. I want to see

1832
03:26:42,020 --> 03:26:45,739
how many we have left. My whole body

1833
03:26:45,739 --> 03:26:54,250
hurts by the way. Let's see. No

1834
03:26:54,250 --> 03:26:59,690
spoilers, no spoilers.

1835
03:26:59,690 --> 03:27:02,819
We have crossed the halfway point

1836
03:27:02,819 --> 03:27:05,129
and we've got a solid

1837
03:27:05,129 --> 03:27:14,340
another probably hour or two left.

1838
03:27:14,340 --> 03:27:16,340
This has been absolutely

1839
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:18,340
hysterical though. These have been some of the highest

1840
03:27:18,340 --> 03:27:20,340
quality things we've seen

1841
03:27:20,340 --> 03:27:23,860
at least in the last three or four years.

1842
03:27:23,860 --> 03:27:27,829
My whole body is aching. My face

1843
03:27:27,829 --> 03:27:31,739
hurts. Real voice.

1844
03:27:31,739 --> 03:27:34,420
Alright, I'll be right back. Give me like two minutes, three minutes.

1845
03:27:34,420 --> 03:33:59,350
Okay, we're back.

1846
03:33:59,350 --> 03:34:01,719
So we're gonna, I'm probably gonna go for like another hour.

1847
03:34:01,719 --> 03:34:04,149
Hour and 25 minutes maybe.

1848
03:34:04,149 --> 03:34:07,479
Do like another 30, 40.

1849
03:34:07,479 --> 03:34:11,319
There's so much here.

1850
03:34:11,319 --> 03:34:13,319
I'm definitely hitting that point where I've been

1851
03:34:13,319 --> 03:34:15,690
laughing and fucking just choking back

1852
03:34:15,690 --> 03:34:19,659
here for the last three and a half hours.

1853
03:34:19,659 --> 03:34:22,729
God. Okay.

1854
03:34:22,729 --> 03:34:24,899
Let's go to the home stretch. It will

1855
03:34:24,899 --> 03:34:27,780
be a part two, don't worry.

1856
03:34:27,780 --> 03:34:29,780
There were 800 videos guys

1857
03:34:29,780 --> 03:34:32,090
and we're not gonna show them all.

1858
03:34:32,090 --> 03:34:34,090
We'll absolutely get through at least

1859
03:34:34,090 --> 03:34:36,579
two, three, four hundred of these.

1860
03:34:36,579 --> 03:34:40,739
I would imagine. There's just too much good

1861
03:34:40,739 --> 03:34:45,979
content. Okay, let's get

1862
03:34:45,979 --> 03:34:51,860
back to it. I just double tapped the screen

1863
03:34:51,860 --> 03:34:58,389
to skip the pee break.

1864
03:34:58,389 --> 03:35:00,389
Alright, let's keep going.

1865
03:35:00,389 --> 03:35:11,209
Let's get another solid hour or two in here.

1866
03:35:11,209 --> 03:35:14,149
Here we go. Next one coming up is Jerma's new

1867
03:35:14,149 --> 03:35:26,809
CSGO tactic.

1868
03:35:42,420 --> 03:35:45,180
I've done this before.

1869
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:47,180
Absolute perfection.

1870
03:35:47,180 --> 03:35:49,180
No ifs, ands, or buts.

1871
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:57,620
Fucking Wizard of Oz.

1872
03:36:21,350 --> 03:36:40,739
Oh, you wanna fight?

1873
03:36:40,739 --> 03:36:42,739
Don't fuck with that.

1874
03:36:42,739 --> 03:36:55,139
We're three.

1875
03:36:55,139 --> 03:36:57,139
We're all gonna put our guns down.

1876
03:36:57,139 --> 03:36:59,139
You think you can do me?

1877
03:36:59,139 --> 03:37:01,139
Stupid.

1878
03:37:01,139 --> 03:37:03,700
One, two,

1879
03:37:03,700 --> 03:37:05,700
three.

1880
03:37:05,700 --> 03:37:08,389
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.

1881
03:37:08,389 --> 03:37:20,340
Hey.

1882
03:37:20,340 --> 03:37:24,059
You're going down.

1883
03:37:24,059 --> 03:37:27,059
Sun fact.

1884
03:37:27,059 --> 03:37:30,840
He's gonna get banned.

1885
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:33,020
Bomb has been planted.

1886
03:37:33,020 --> 03:38:00,459
It's not there.

1887
03:38:00,459 --> 03:38:05,620
Where is it?

1888
03:38:05,620 --> 03:38:07,620
I got it.

1889
03:38:07,620 --> 03:38:13,190
Terrorists win.

1890
03:38:13,190 --> 03:38:15,190
I love this part.

1891
03:38:15,190 --> 03:38:17,750
Coming up here.

1892
03:38:17,750 --> 03:38:19,750
We need ten seconds after

1893
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:25,379
that one.

1894
03:38:25,379 --> 03:38:40,149
That was very, very good.

1895
03:38:40,149 --> 03:38:42,149
Well done. That was very, very fun.

1896
03:38:42,149 --> 03:38:46,440
This is super Jerma rumble

1897
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:49,899
melee. Let's check it out.

1898
03:38:49,899 --> 03:39:04,979
Fuck you.

1899
03:39:04,979 --> 03:39:46,379
Burn in

1900
03:39:46,379 --> 03:40:14,979
smoke.

1901
03:40:14,979 --> 03:40:23,559
This is terrible.

1902
03:40:23,559 --> 03:40:25,559
Imagine an earwig looking up at you

1903
03:40:25,559 --> 03:40:27,559
and he's like

1904
03:40:27,559 --> 03:40:31,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1905
03:40:31,340 --> 03:40:34,020
Everybody hold on a second.

1906
03:40:34,020 --> 03:40:36,819
Didn't we talk about this

1907
03:40:36,819 --> 03:40:39,770
like three days ago?

1908
03:40:39,770 --> 03:40:44,379
Like four days ago? Did you do this in

1909
03:40:44,379 --> 03:40:46,870
one day? One day?

1910
03:40:46,870 --> 03:40:51,350
At the deadline?

1911
03:40:51,350 --> 03:40:53,350
Holy shit. What?

1912
03:40:53,350 --> 03:40:55,350
You did this in like four hours?

1913
03:40:55,350 --> 03:41:00,010
Okay. Well, let's go.

1914
03:41:00,010 --> 03:41:02,010
Imagine an earwig looking up at you

1915
03:41:02,010 --> 03:41:07,319
and he's like, and I'm like, oh, get the

1916
03:41:07,319 --> 03:41:09,319
envelope. Save him.

1917
03:41:09,319 --> 03:41:11,319
And I get the envelope and I get him

1918
03:41:11,319 --> 03:41:13,319
on the envelope and I put him outside. And then the

1919
03:41:13,319 --> 03:41:15,319
next day, it's like three that you see.

1920
03:41:15,319 --> 03:41:17,319
And you're like, oh, wow, cool.

1921
03:41:17,319 --> 03:41:19,319
Let's save these three. To the same

1922
03:41:19,319 --> 03:41:22,459
fucking soundtrack.

1923
03:41:22,459 --> 03:41:24,459
Oh, save us.

1924
03:41:24,459 --> 03:41:26,700
Here come another

1925
03:41:26,700 --> 03:41:29,450
50 in your house.

1926
03:41:29,450 --> 03:41:31,450
And they're all dancing in a line.

1927
03:41:31,450 --> 03:41:33,450
Doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna,

1928
03:41:33,450 --> 03:41:35,450
two antenna, top hat, top hat,

1929
03:41:35,450 --> 03:41:37,450
top hat. It's like, well, 50 earwigs.

1930
03:41:37,450 --> 03:41:39,450
Oh my god, they're so cute. Get the envelope.

1931
03:41:39,450 --> 03:41:41,450
They all start crawling on it.

1932
03:41:41,450 --> 03:41:43,450
You get them out, you save them, save the

1933
03:41:43,450 --> 03:41:46,010
earwigs. And then

1934
03:41:46,010 --> 03:41:48,010
me lying down in bed three

1935
03:41:48,010 --> 03:41:50,010
days later. I'm drifting off to

1936
03:41:50,010 --> 03:41:52,010
sleep.

1937
03:41:52,010 --> 03:41:54,010
What a nice day that was today.

1938
03:41:54,010 --> 03:41:56,309
The second that I fall asleep

1939
03:41:56,309 --> 03:41:58,309
and I go into REM, they can sense it.

1940
03:41:58,309 --> 03:42:00,309
And two thousand earwigs

1941
03:42:00,309 --> 03:42:02,309
just make a trail up the bed

1942
03:42:02,309 --> 03:42:04,309
and just go into my brain

1943
03:42:04,309 --> 03:42:06,309
to this music. And they all

1944
03:42:06,309 --> 03:42:08,309
going in, digging in, like

1945
03:42:08,309 --> 03:42:10,309
eating pieces of my brain matter.

1946
03:42:10,309 --> 03:42:12,309
And I'm just asleep.

1947
03:42:12,309 --> 03:42:15,129
And some of

1948
03:42:15,129 --> 03:42:19,100
them are still dancing with top hat.

1949
03:42:19,100 --> 03:42:23,899
I love earwigs.

1950
03:42:23,899 --> 03:42:26,649
How did you do that in like

1951
03:42:26,649 --> 03:42:32,459
a day? That was awesome.

1952
03:42:32,459 --> 03:42:34,459
Okay, Jerma owes the precious two point

1953
03:42:34,459 --> 03:42:36,629
oh god. I hate

1954
03:42:36,629 --> 03:42:38,629
this image. That's the image that pops up.

1955
03:42:38,629 --> 03:42:40,629
It's just so ugly.

1956
03:43:00,629 --> 03:43:04,639
And minus fifty.

1957
03:43:42,860 --> 03:43:44,860
Don't get up, don't get up.

1958
03:43:44,860 --> 03:43:46,860
Can't be the one with

1959
03:43:46,860 --> 03:43:48,860
the new earwigs.

1960
03:43:48,860 --> 03:43:50,860
Don't get up,

1961
03:43:50,860 --> 03:43:52,860
don't get up.

1962
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:54,860
Why, why, why, why, why?

1963
03:43:54,860 --> 03:43:56,860
I miss you a lot

1964
03:43:56,860 --> 03:43:59,940
for ever.

1965
03:43:59,940 --> 03:44:01,940
She feels like one.

1966
03:44:01,940 --> 03:44:03,940
Throw down that hole.

1967
03:44:03,940 --> 03:44:05,940
Hole, hole,

1968
03:44:05,940 --> 03:44:36,930
hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole

1969
03:44:36,930 --> 03:45:06,930
hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole, hole

1970
03:45:06,930 --> 03:45:06,989
bro, you're Should I Use That?

1971
03:45:54,129 --> 03:46:01,459
Dude, did you get that?

1972
03:46:01,459 --> 03:46:02,379
thank you.

1973
03:46:02,379 --> 03:46:06,219
thank you so much.

1974
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:06,940
I don't listen.

1975
03:46:06,940 --> 03:46:09,020
I'm the only one that didn't say no.

1976
03:46:09,020 --> 03:46:10,100
I thought that was phenomenal.

1977
03:46:10,100 --> 03:46:11,139
I thought you did a great job.

1978
03:46:11,139 --> 03:46:11,940
I don't.

1979
03:46:11,940 --> 03:46:14,399
I don't listen to any of these jokers.

1980
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:15,059
I thought that was great.

1981
03:46:15,059 --> 03:46:16,420
We've been working on it for like, what, two

1982
03:46:16,420 --> 03:46:17,819
weeks, three weeks now?

1983
03:46:17,819 --> 03:46:19,040
Well actually,

1984
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:24,360
Sure. Well, my problem was it was a bit too fast. You see for Elise was wrote in for Elise

1985
03:46:24,879 --> 03:46:30,959
And it was actually really supposed to be a tender loving song that picked up at times like the heights of relationships

1986
03:46:30,959 --> 03:46:35,680
But also slowed down like the lows right and I didn't feel the passion come through although the notes did

1987
03:46:36,280 --> 03:46:38,280
Right. It's not good

1988
03:46:39,559 --> 03:46:41,479
He's got a point

1989
03:46:41,479 --> 03:46:43,200
number 14

1990
03:46:43,200 --> 03:46:48,530
That was a phenomenal phenomenal time of the piano, but after hearing what do you mean? It's not good judges

1991
03:46:48,530 --> 03:46:50,930
I only know what video game music is. What do you got?

1992
03:46:51,569 --> 03:46:53,569
Well, I mean, I just

1993
03:46:54,809 --> 03:47:01,370
Don't really listen to it. I thought that was quite lovely. It's perfect number 14. I'm so sorry

1994
03:47:02,370 --> 03:47:05,930
You got a great look. I think you look at the great. Look you got the look of the part

1995
03:47:07,209 --> 03:47:12,610
Apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people, but I don't want you to quit. Okay, what is it?

1996
03:47:12,610 --> 03:47:15,549
Who's this arcade? Joseph? Sorry. It can be a big thing

1997
03:47:16,250 --> 03:47:18,250
It can be a big

1998
03:47:19,290 --> 03:47:26,139
Shut up. It's arcade one day. Shut up. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, shut the fuck up

1999
03:47:27,540 --> 03:47:33,629
Stupid you're all stupid idiots get the fuck out of here man dumb. You're the dumbest one here

2000
03:47:44,149 --> 03:47:50,170
The best part is Ludwig saying Oh Joseph's arcades gonna be big one day. What are you?

2001
03:47:51,370 --> 03:50:56,649
Oh, that was great got another copyright warning by the way

2002
03:50:57,010 --> 03:51:03,430
They're not happy. My favorite movie is frozen

2003
03:51:04,709 --> 03:51:06,709

2058
03:59:29,620 --> 03:59:33,940
Previous times I've been in front of the green screen. It's bit you couldn't hear a single goddamn thing. I was saying

Responded in the discord. They said somebody said how long did it take for you to render this? They said two days

2095
04:03:55,430 --> 04:04:14,100

My goodness gracious. Okay, all the three times that I've done this they can do anything

2100
04:04:48,139 --> 04:04:51,420
All right, one more thing and I'm gonna clean honest to God. I didn't get it

By the hate coming up here. This is bugs ever. I don't like when the bugs are everywhere

2112
04:06:47,840 --> 04:06:50,200
I can tolerate them when they were in small doses

2113
04:06:50,959 --> 04:06:57,100
But dude, is this something on me? This is up on my back. Is this something on my back? Just tell me get it

2116
04:07:53,790 --> 04:07:56,799
Say it again man, say it again

2117
04:08:16,180 --> 04:08:22,559
I fear I deliver you to a darker place. May the light of lights illuminate your path

2118
04:08:23,440 --> 04:08:24,600
No

2119
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:26,860

2122
04:08:40,149 --> 04:08:43,899
Holy shit, that was so loud for me. I'm glad it wasn't loud for you

2123
04:08:45,299 --> 04:08:53,870
Jesus that hurts my head my head actually hurts now. I turned that down 50% for you. Not for me, by the way

2124
04:08:53,870 --> 04:08:55,629
I was sitting here laughing to

Leather jacket in the in the mod chat said that video the one before this one

2126
04:09:01,350 --> 04:09:04,229
That was five hours probably took like a two hundred dollars in electricity to render

2127
04:09:04,469 --> 04:09:14,309
Dude, they're getting more and more fucking unhinged, right?

2128
04:09:15,110 --> 04:09:22,760
Indescribable feeling we get and we go somewhere

2129
04:09:28,299 --> 04:09:34,540
Oh, excuse me in seat 1a we've got a farter here. We've got a farter in one day

That was the whole video just so you just so you understand that was the entire video

2133
04:09:52,770 --> 04:09:54,770
Indescribable feeling we get

2134
04:09:55,489 --> 04:10:00,809
That was it you lost 30 seconds of your life

2135
04:10:06,020 --> 04:10:10,659
Oh, excuse me in seat 1a we've got a farter here

2136
04:10:10,659 --> 04:10:16,170
And why would it be some random dickhead with a webcam on and sitting at his desk?

2137
04:10:16,329 --> 04:10:24,500
Who who is this person? Is this a producer of the movie? Who the fuck is this guy?

2138
04:10:24,500 --> 04:10:28,420
Why is this webcam video? We've got a farter in one day

Hello, Jerma Anthony Banthony from mr. Green Gazette your team give up a home run

2155
04:12:09,920 --> 04:12:13,639
I gotta pause this because this is like an old-timey radio mic

2156
04:12:13,719 --> 04:12:18,270
I'm not even a press conference booth and that you had a shot at catching at the wall

2157
04:12:18,270 --> 04:12:23,850
But you weren't able to catch it. Do you think your short stature had an influence on the way it played out?

2158
04:12:26,040 --> 04:12:29,799
Listen I'll give you this. I'm not I'm not tiny. I'm compact

2162
04:12:43,579 --> 04:12:50,219
I've eight with shoes. Hi Jerma. You had a moment where you dropped an easy fly ball in the infield and

2163
04:12:50,739 --> 04:12:55,059
One of your teammates he told me that your manager BF bugleberry

2164
04:12:55,420 --> 04:13:01,540
He confronted you about that play and you allegedly told him to quote suck a fart out of your ass

2165
04:13:02,379 --> 04:13:06,139
We actually have the audio for that argument right here. I'm just gonna play that right now

2166
04:13:06,500 --> 04:13:08,500
How about you suck a fart out of my ass?

2167
04:13:09,500 --> 04:13:15,139
Pretty rude. I'd say I didn't say that apologize to your manager. No, no, I'm sorry. No, I ain't gonna do it

2168
04:13:15,780 --> 04:13:17,020
No

2223
04:20:17,799 --> 04:20:21,770
No one wants a dog

04:27:26,340 --> 04:27:33,260
Another human species had established itself across much of the Eurasian continent the Neanderthals

2278
04:27:39,190 --> 04:27:46,750
Fossils discovered during the last two centuries in the Atlantic Ocean and in Siberia have shed some light on these mysterious

04:27:47,430 --> 04:27:53,670
Archaic humans I was in VR for like eight hours. Okay, that's why I look like that. They had culture they had

Social systems they had intelligence

2281
04:28:01,280 --> 04:28:09,639
Recent archaeological finds in England and France have helped researchers find out more about these early inhabitants of Eurasia

2282
04:29:20,340 --> 04:29:26,479
First stream my nose is like congested from laughing. What the hell happened to me? I

God damn you guys knock it out of the park every single time every single time

I honestly can't believe it every time we do this. It gets better. The videos are funnier how

2517
05:04:46,819 --> 05:04:51,619
I would watch more. I really would but i'm i'm at that limit of insanity, right?

2525
05:05:43,939 --> 05:05:49,689
Blessed to have a community that's this talented and this funny. I really don't I don't think there's anything like this

By the way, huge thanks to the mods and community leaders. They um, they vetted all these videos

2530
05:06:23,029 --> 05:06:25,270
They had to watch all these I didn't see any of these, right?

2531
05:06:25,590 --> 05:06:29,340
So can we get a clap for the mods and community leaders, please?

2532
05:06:30,279 --> 05:06:35,880
Because they went through the last week plus of watching these and getting some uh, giving me the playlist and everything

2533
05:06:35,880 --> 05:06:40,459
So i'll see you again in a couple days two three days. Keep an eye on the sus maybe on

2539
05:07:24,810 --> 05:07:38,520
I haven't raided anybody in a long time. Who's who's streaming right now? Who could we go to? Uh, we could go to

2540
05:07:40,229 --> 05:07:45,029
Hey, let's go to vinny. Vinny's playing half-life. We literally watched like 10 half-life videos

2541
05:07:45,349 --> 05:07:54,490
Let's go raid vinny. Say hi to vinny. Vinny was in like three of those videos videos too. So that's funny

05:08:14,020 --> 05:08:21,830
Maybe uh, maybe some more multiverses. You might see that too. That's a possibility. Take care of yourselves. Good night

2546
05:08:22,229 --> 05:08:33,750
Thanks for sticking around. Have a wonderful rest of your evening. Goodbye. Call you mother. See you soon

2547
05:09:33,939 --> 05:09:39,270
Uh, I want to say also real quick the vaude is probably absolutely destroyed

2548
05:09:40,360 --> 05:09:45,639
I would be surprised if you could even watch it. So in the event that it's absolutely just

2549
05:09:46,340 --> 05:09:52,680
Decimated I might have to just delete it. It depends. So be aware of that. It's a half. It's probably muted

2550
05:09:53,400 --> 05:09:55,400
Uh, if you weren't here, i'm really sorry, but

2551
05:09:55,880 --> 05:09:59,349
Uh dmca copyright, that's where we're

2552
05:09:59,909 --> 05:10:01,909
Okay, we just moved to vinny's channel

2553
05:10:02,889 --> 05:10:04,889
All right. Goodbye
