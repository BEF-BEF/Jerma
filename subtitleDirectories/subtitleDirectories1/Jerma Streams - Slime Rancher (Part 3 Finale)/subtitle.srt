1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:18,500
Good afternoon. How you doing? On time. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody bet on this? No bets for this?

2
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:25,269
Oh, okay. I figured maybe there would be a bet for that.

3
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,170
Wait, you mean I could have been like 10 minutes late? If there was a bet, I was like,

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,009
oh, maybe they bet on this. I better get in there and turn it on. No, I'm kidding. I'm here.

5
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:41,670
I'm going to play Slime Rancher again. Played it last night. I think it's great.

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,539
And I'm going to get my fill. So we'll see after today if that's the case.

7
00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:00,090
After three streams on German985twitch.tv, we have to decide if I'm going to continue

8
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,900
or if three is enough. We'll find out. I do love the game though. It's a chill, fun thing to do.

9
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,599
I'm really into it. Please wish me a happy birthday. Your name is so dark I couldn't

10
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,700
even read your name. It's like a dark navy blue. It blends in with the background. I can't read it.

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:28,819
I couldn't even read your name. Happy birthday, whoever you were. What was your name?

12
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:43,849
Happy birthday. Can you not wish me a happy birthday? That's just every day that's not your

13
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:54,739
birthday. We're going to get right into this. I don't need to introduce this at all. This is

14
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,819
three streams in a row of Slime Ranchers, so I don't really need to talk that much about it.

15
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,900
There was something I wanted you guys to remind me of and I was thinking about it before I turned

16
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:12,819
the stream on. I have a drill, right? I have two drills. It was something else. It was the drills

17
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:24,340
and something else. Explain the game. These little creatures, you feed them and they shit out money.

18
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:31,159
That's the entire game. There's nothing else in the game. It's just collecting creatures that go

19
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,050
to the bathroom and then you make money off of their bathroom. I mean, it's pretty cool.

20
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,009
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Don't need to waste any time. Here we are. I'm already in the game.

21
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:49,719
I've been waiting. I've been ready. I've been sitting here the entire day just waiting for

22
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:58,120
exactly 2 p.m. to go through or 2 30 so I can turn it on and play. Move this a little bit. That's

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,759
going to distract me. Okay, it's done. Can you guys hear it? Yes, you can. We're good to go.

24
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:16,020
Get to the dentist. For what? I need to go to the dentist? Remember, people are going to start

25
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,009
thinking your name is actually Andy. I don't think so. I don't think they're going to think that.

26
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,229
All right, the last thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The drills, the drills. We got to go to the drills.

27
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:42,120
All right, suck up. Your name isn't Andy. Oh, we got, okay, okay. Good, good, good. Yeah,

28
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,849
I remember the plan here. I got a lot of money. Right. No, it was buy the docs. That's what you

29
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:54,659
guys supposed to remind me. You guys supposed to remind me to buy the docs and take the stuff out

30
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,159
of the drill. That's not what you're doing right now. You're just saying Andy. That's not helping

31
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:13,819
me. It doesn't help me. I tried. No, it's not just one of you that has to try. It's like 3,000 of you

32
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:20,620
have to try because I can't read one person's comment. You have to all just amalgamize into

33
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:34,949
one comment. What about the one guy's? Yeah, but that's different. Okay, those drills are over here.

34
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:51,189
No, I want to get the oka oka. I need the hive mine to yell at me. Yeah. If you missed last night's

35
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:57,750
stream or you didn't stay the whole time, we just got crystals and we just got rad slimes

36
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,230
and I combined the crystal and the rad slime and made a crystal rad slime.

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:17,100
Oh boy, you missed it. I'm saying among us. Okay, let's go. That's sick. Why? Why are you saying

38
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:31,399
among us? I said that. I didn't. When did I say among us? All right, let's get some money

39
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:49,430
and then let's let them eat oka oka is their favorite food. Okay, I'm going to sell this.

40
00:05:51,480 --> 00:06:09,339
Look at those crystals. Has the price gone up? I wonder you forgot what I forget. You did

41
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:20,120
among us in a nutshell. Oh, Michael. Oh, but what did you do? You guys got like collectively hit by

42
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,199
like the fairy godmother. Why are you guys? Oh, what's going on here? Like somebody will have

43
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:31,459
a wand over this chat. What are you guys doing? Are you going to kill me if I stand on that?

44
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:46,139
Shit. I didn't mean to do that. It'll be fine. It's the hive mind. But why? Why is the hive mind

45
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,420
saying among us? All right. I know you're a hive mind, but why is the hive mind saying among us?

46
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,670
I need an explanation for it. We're toxic.

47
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:15,750
Why are you guys doing this? Because we're toxic. Oh, okay. What are you doing? 38? This

48
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,269
these went down in value. I should have held. We know it pisses you off.

49
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:33,750
No, it doesn't. It's a joke on you. I don't care. I don't even care. They think that like it makes

50
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,750
me mad. I don't even fucking care. Oh my god. Imagine thinking like I cared about that.

51
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,810
Oh, you're really getting to me. I don't care. He was just wasting so much time saying that.

52
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't fucking even care. I need to donate this stuff. Jerma, you're a valley girl.

53
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:12,389
I want to donate and then we're going to check on the drills. Yes. How am I a valley girl? What's

54
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:22,329
this quest? This guy. Working on a new recipe. Help me out. What does he want? Oh, those rewards

55
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:28,230
are terrible. I mean, eight chickens. I can go get eight chickens right now in my backyard. No,

56
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:43,059
not even worth it. All the upgrades are done. Let's go this way. Do it. No, I can go pick up

57
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:56,179
eight chickens right now in 15 seconds. It's not worth it. When he said I'm willing to pay you to

58
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:09,940
talk to my friend. She's anti Jerma. I don't. That's okay. I don't care. That's fine. That's

59
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:27,720
what you can. We don't all have to like the same TV shows. Oh, I need to donate these shit. Yes,

60
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,309
we do. No, if we all like the same TV shows, how would we argue with each other about what the best

61
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:43,049
TV show is? Or what season was the best? Guys, there are a lot of you. There are a lot of you.

62
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:49,529
There are a ton of you among us here. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. God. There's a

63
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:57,019
lot of you here that would argue about the arcs of this channel. Oh, yeah. Boston Arc was better

64
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:03,019
than Vegas Arc. No, no, no, no, no. Jerma Basement Arc was better than Jerma Boston Arc.

65
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:27,659
I mean, that happens here. Jerma Arc Tier List. Okay, there's been like two. There's been two.

66
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,139
Actually, no, there's been a there's been actually quite a few arcs, hasn't there?

67
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:48,539
Are they arcs or are they what would you even call them? There's seasons.

68
00:10:53,029 --> 00:11:00,259
It'd be kind of funny to name streams with the title like seasons in them. Like I said,

69
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,929
what's the title right now? Like, oh, Slime Rancher, like getting that money.

70
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:14,490
Jerma Season 3 Episode 40 or something. But that season finale is like something crazy would

71
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:27,879
have to happen. We'd have to have season finales. Are these ready? Oh, only two minutes. All right,

72
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:35,659
two minutes and 27 seconds and I can get these. Catboy is season finale. I don't know if I agree.

73
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:47,210
I don't think I agree with that. I think Catboy would be series finale because Netflix ain't

74
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:58,980
picking it up for another season after that one. Netflix is going to be like,

75
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:03,799
we didn't like the direction of the Catboy stuff. We're no longer we're not going to be

76
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:15,480
renewing German N8-5 for a fourth season. All right, put these hens over here. How do I burn

77
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,590
two minutes? How do I kill two minutes? What's your opinion on the word plort? I think it's pretty

78
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:40,409
sick. Next question, please. What are you doing? That's your question. Hey, what are you doing?

79
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,879
Next question, please. What are you doing? What are you? What are you up to? What are you doing?

80
00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:01,240
How are you? How are you doing? I don't know why I thought that was so funny. Look at all this.

81
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,299
This is day. Excuse me. How am I feeling? I'm feeling pretty good. It's been a good day.

82
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,659
I forgot that this existed. Now I'm going to have a lot of these.

83
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:35,019
You free tonight? All right, I'm not free tonight. I didn't. I got to put something over here.

84
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,419
Like, all right, what do I put over here? High walls, music box, but just do it. Air net,

85
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,460
what collector? I got to put something over here. Auto feeder. I got to get something in here.

86
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:59,159
What should I put over here? I'll figure it out. All right, chickens are doing good.

87
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:09,049
I got my mangoes. I already asked if I could sleep over and then your mom said yes. Oh, I get it.

88
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,460
Was that like an insult or something? I don't know what that means.

89
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:33,860
That's like an insult. What do you mean? No, he just asked. Wait, that wasn't like a,

90
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,659
hey, man, I already asked your mom if I could sleep over. She said yes, I'm sleeping over

91
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:51,929
your mom and your mom. That wasn't what that was. I thought that's what that was. What is this?

92
00:14:51,929 --> 00:15:01,299
Oh, shit. There's a mango in here. That'll fill up. How are we doing? All right. Now,

93
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:13,860
it's two minutes going up. I think it's time to check out the drill. Real time. They asked you

94
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,769
for your mother's permission. Okay, but wouldn't your mother need to ask my mother for permission

95
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:26,889
to make sure it was real? In this scenario for both kids, you have to ask my mom if you

96
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:33,129
can sleep over. Wouldn't your parents need to be the ones to be like, hey, can Timmy sleep over

97
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:40,899
tonight? Like, hey, can I sleep over tonight? Well, we have to check with your mom. Yes. Yeah.

98
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:56,710
Ready? Oh, these are blue. Oh, no, they're not. Oh, okay, I get it. They're not different than

99
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:11,129
the regular ones. They just do three cycles. Okay. Oh, pretty cool. Do I sleep with? Okay.

100
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,169
I'm going to stop. We're going to stop that conversation right there.

101
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:33,480
You guys, what the hell are you doing? I want some more advanced drills. Don't you?

102
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:49,980
What's the, what's the shit from Avatar on, on obtaining them? Advanced drill. All right,

103
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,179
I can make some more of these. I'm going to put one on the one I'm putting on there.

104
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:09,400
That's a real element. Unobtanium is a real element. I don't, I feel like that's a lie.

105
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:32,680
That's an unobtanium. I don't think that's real. I want crystals. I'm going to do one more cell,

106
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,410
and then I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to go explore. I have a, I have another key.

107
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:54,250
Among us tanium. Actually banned that person forever. I'd like actually, I'm sorry. I'm very

108
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:01,019
sorry, but you have to be banned forever. At least like for 15 minutes, like among us tanium.

109
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,500
How dare you? You know what I mean? Like let's just say, let's just be real. How dare you?

110
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:14,759
I want that person timed out for at least 10 minutes. It's hard for me not to say forever.

111
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:21,140
What if 10 minutes? I don't even know who said it. And I may have added extra syllables and extra

112
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,740
words to it. I find the person that started me down that path and I want them out of here for

113
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:48,119
15 minutes. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

114
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,009
I don't even need these hens. Does anybody eat meat over here? Somebody does down here.

115
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:19,609
You can't ban us all. No, you're right. I can't, I cannot ban you all. I can't, but I can.

116
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:30,980
There's some things I can do. I can put it into sub only, five minute slow mode, and then that's

117
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:45,240
goodbye. Can't hear you anymore. Okay, good. We'll have one more haul to deliver.

118
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:57,819
I know these guys have a shitload. Yes, they do. Not really. Do it. No, I'm not. I just, I can do

119
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:08,359
it. That doesn't mean I'm going to do it. It means I can. Oh, I wonder if I should. No, I'll just

120
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,069
sell if he cares. All right. Now I'm going to buy the dock and we're going to go through the dock.

121
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:28,309
Oh yeah. 15 grand. I'm going to go, I'm going to sleep and we're going to go to the dock and

122
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:42,250
here we go. I'm a dog that just got out of the bath. I had to really shake violently around.

123
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,519
The point where you look at the dog and you're like, does their brain shake around like crazy

124
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:58,539
when they do that? Doesn't that give them a headache? All right. The dock was down here,

125
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:12,730
right? When a dog shakes that like, you know what I'm talking about? They shake, shake, shake.

126
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:19,940
It starts off kind of slow. It's like shake, shake, shake, shake. That seems like it would be like,

127
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:28,900
holy shit, that's fast. No, no, no, growling. Like that's the vibrations of them shaking.

128
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:38,619
Here we go. The docks deep down in the great blue sea. I saw a thousand slimes smiling back at me.

129
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's go. Dock. What? Here we go. Boys and girls. Oh my God. Oh, it's just another area. Okay. Fuck.

130
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,660
I didn't even need to do this. There was, is that, there's nothing here? Oh, it's just extra space.

131
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:11,700
Well, I don't even need this. Not, at least not now. You got baited. Well, not really. So where

132
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:34,869

133
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:42,380

134
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,579
playing among us. Yeah, currently playing among, you guys keep fucking saying it and then you keep

135
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,460
writing it. You're burning it into my head. I just, it's, it's half of every message.

136
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:59,640
It's half of every single message. Every single one. I can't get, I can't, I can't get away from

137
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:09,990
it. It's all I can read. All right. I need to, I need to open up a door. Wait, couldn't I,

138
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,779
didn't I get a treasure unlocking ability thing? I did, didn't I? All right. I need to, I'm going

139
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:23,420
to open up a door. Where is there another door I can open? I have a, I have two keys, don't I?

140
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:31,099
I have one key. Isn't there one down here? I swear to God there is. I swear to God. Yeah, there it is.

141
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:40,519
All right, cool. Let's go. I'm going to open this up. What's this way? I don't know. Why would I, is

142
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:49,220
this, should I get this? I don't know if this is like worth doing. This doesn't look worth it.

143
00:23:51,559 --> 00:24:02,329
I got to go back here and then open this over here. This is a shortcut. Yeah, I gotta get the

144
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:06,009
last area. All right. I'm going to go back to here. We'll go back to the crystal place.

145
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:25,819
Okay. Yeah. Back to the crystal place. I already unlocked that area. Yeah. Is there a cave that I

146
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:36,839
can open a door? Because I got the two keys last time. Ban the word among us. You know, that sounds

147
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:44,200
fantastic, actually. That sounds like a great idea. That sounds like a fantastic idea.

148
00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:09,960
Among us. Why? You know, I, when I watch like meme compilation videos and a bunch of shit about

149
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,400
Among Us pops up and I'm in a room with more than one or two people, I have to pretend to know what

150
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,230
their laugh, but what's, what's funny about it. And I'm just like, Oh yeah. I mean like, I don't

151
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:31,380
know that crew member. I have no idea what's going on. Are you five? What do you mean? Watching

152
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:39,740
meme compilation videos? What's wrong? Is there nothing wrong with that? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

153
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,500
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody, I want to, I'm silenced.

154
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,299
I need to go over this. You guys have not had auto play on and you just don't care what plays next.

155
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:56,059
And eventually it always leads back to a meme compilation video. Eventually, even like a few

156
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:08,059
hours could go by and then somehow for some reason that cannot be explained you end up on the daily

157
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:15,980
dose of internet video page and you just let them play and you don't stop you just sit there for like

158
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:26,230
two hours you don't it doesn't even it could be four hours you just sit there i didn't i didn't

159
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,829

160
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:35,910

01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:30,460
oh press it press it hold on okay um i can open doors we're going further into the temple

410
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:45,159
is these weird hologram things all over the place excuse me new slime give us a new slime

411
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:55,699
give us a new slime give us it give us every once it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah quantum slime

412
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:28,789
quantum slime hurry get as many as i can quantum crystal is the new play cool what do quantums eat

413
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:48,180
oh we're going this way like oh oh this is gonna freak me out all right how about down here

414
01:20:48,180 --> 01:21:02,569
what is over here anything read my lips what about this tree oh can i open it nice something

415
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:07,130
valuable come on i deserve it a sunburst sweet

416
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:39,770
let's try to get a good like 10 20 20 quantum slimes i'll take the puddles

417
01:21:40,810 --> 01:22:03,050
you know i like them oh what's this a red echo oh red echo how far into the game are you

418
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:10,039
um i believe this is the final area so i've unlocked all the areas i don't know exactly

419
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:14,359
how much is left but i mean enough for me to like just mess around and sell things and buy things

420
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:32,550
and there's another one oh pink echoes i need that device that shows you the map

421
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:40,899
whoa this is like this is quantum fruit how do i turn this on look this is like a quantum fruit

422
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:52,920
tree how do i get that to work they probably eat these they eat fruit okay hit it with a fruit

423
01:22:53,819 --> 01:23:17,340
okay one whoa a phase lemon holy shit okay that's definitely their favorite food

424
01:23:17,979 --> 01:23:23,399
there's no way a phase lemons not a quantum slime's favorite food oh i gotta go back

425
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:41,770
i gotta get out of here i gotta go but is there another slime to get here hold on come here

426
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:45,699
and there's another treasure trove there

427
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:49,109
here

428
01:23:49,109 --> 01:24:02,420
can't open it though lava i i'm gonna get it there's a treasure pod oh i don't have any room

429
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:17,989
no what do i do oh shit i don't want to open this what if it's good i don't want to get rid of the

430
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:34,170
puddles is it good okay we're fine urgent grass patch i want at least 20 slimes before i go

431
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:50,779
anywhere i want 20 of the slimes i want 20 of them we have to do a lot of uh slime combination

432
01:24:50,779 --> 01:25:02,979
here how do we get out of here you have 21 you don't need the echo i don't what do you mean

433
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:14,649
where's the among us what nine plus ten is 21 quantum slime echo is a decoration

434
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:32,680
echo is a cosmetic decoration it's a lie that's a lie that's definitely a lie you just you want

435
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:40,220
to shoot it into the ocean so you can write omega low like 100 of you oh wait a minute what's this

436
01:25:40,220 --> 01:26:10,310
what do they love phase lemons are their favorite i gotta grow phase lemons

437
01:26:10,869 --> 01:26:17,859
feed him an echo i know what that is now but i need to feed him a fruit so he shows up on the map

438
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:25,079
anything really this is like okay no no i don't i know where he is i'll put like the weird lake

439
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:38,220
up here okay i don't remember how to get out of here you have a phase lemon i'm not shooting that

440
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:55,050
i want to grow these i need to see what that lava is though right we gotta go over there

441
01:26:55,770 --> 01:27:15,739
i need to see what this is or we get out of the way what's the lava it's a lava slime

442
01:27:15,739 --> 01:27:24,840
that's a boom gordo he eats meat oh wait wait i want to be able to mark this

443
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:48,810
can't like bounce it off the wall go around idiot and i i mean go we need to go around

444
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:24,020
all right just go around go go where's the button to press this need to open that door through the

445
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:41,909
door what door fly over the wall hold on grab more quantums um every time i see him i'm trying

446
01:28:41,909 --> 01:29:07,239
to pick him up ah yes i'm out thank goodness oh there's the teleporter all right now

447
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:21,340
i don't know what i did all right i gotta where's that gordo is over here where is he he's in here

448
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:36,359
right he's right there so can i go around here like where do i go let's see he's in there the

449
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:47,000
door is open dropped from what do you mean the door is open door is open door the door is open

450
01:29:48,090 --> 01:30:21,050
oh the door the door the door is open now he's marked now i know where he is thank you

451
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:30,659
the other guy's like right here the door is cosmetic it is not cosmetic and i'll like it

452
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:38,439
actually get me out of here and i'm gonna do some quantum slime computing you guys know that the

453
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:51,029
quantum computing stuff you guys hear about that isn't the whole scary thing with quantum computing

454
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:56,949
that it can like crack your password in like three seconds can't can a quantum computer crack

455
01:30:56,949 --> 01:31:08,630
any password in like less than a day or something what we're gonna do pick him up what the fuck

456
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:28,180
we're gonna cry no not even close what do you mean not even close quantum computing also allows

457
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:34,039
for ultimate privacy ultimate ultimate privacy well i don't have a quantum computer i'm not

458
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:37,420
going to be able to have when they first come out the person with the first quantum computer

459
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:55,640
is gonna get everybody's password i got 27 quantum slimes is there does it i gotta get

460
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:05,989
that teleporter all right all right all right let's make this happen quantum quantum computing

461
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:13,979
has been around since before you were born jeremy yeah but just because this one in some random

462
01:32:13,979 --> 01:32:21,579
nasa warehouse when we all have one when it fits inside of your hand like a smartphone

463
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:37,750
it's not how it works yeah and guess what 40 50 years ago we didn't think that we'd be able to

464
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:51,619
send our voices through the air to each other that that's that's fucked up isn't it a radio

465
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:58,819
no you know i hold on a minute we're not talking about radio we're talking about i can i can through

466
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:05,460
the air to satellite to satellite call you if you're in tokyo and i'm in vegas and we can have a

467
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:11,850
clear perfectly normal conversation i'm not talking about like hey hey hold on

468
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:33,539
yeah and they're like 200 feet away from each other yeah telephone goes through wires

469
01:33:33,539 --> 01:33:39,510
what do you mean the telephone yeah the telephone went through a wire into the wall

470
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:57,180
through into the ground this overgrowing fruit the internet is wires not wireless internet

471
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:03,189
that sounded like i was elvis oh look at all these puddle slides we're gonna put it here

472
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:17,909
mobile phones eventually go to wires i don't even know that yeah i okay i took a networking

473
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:27,939
class in college i took networking one i learned how to crimp a ethernet cable so okay okay so

474
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:49,140
what you're but you know right i was in like 1989 look at all these cute little ports networking

475
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:55,939
andy oh shit i don't have any more crystals because i turn them into rad crystals well

476
01:34:55,939 --> 01:35:00,420
looks like we're getting rid of some shit what are we getting rid of oh i know we're getting

477
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:08,260
rid of out here does quantum need something special because it is time to get rid of the cats

478
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:13,770
didn't i get rid of the cats already why are they still here wait what happened

479
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:19,909
i thought i got rid of these already oh i made a new plot that's right that's right that's right

480
01:35:19,909 --> 01:35:29,289
i know where it is are they gonna phase out of existence if i put them in here are they

481
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:42,680
gonna disappear let me read quantum quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort

482
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:48,340
of event that took place in the ancient ruins long ago yep at all times the quantum slime

483
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:54,500
is capable of admitting other possible realities of their being called ghosts these other realities

484
01:35:54,500 --> 01:36:00,659
can come true with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of the ghost effectively teleporting

485
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:06,300
quantum slimes can be one of the most difficult slimes to manage given the unique abilities a

486
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:10,939
rancher needs to learn to detect when quantum slimes are primed to take over the reality of a

487
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:16,300
ghost and i quickly such as feeding them or just splashing them with some fresh water as a temporary

488
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:34,739
measure so i have to keep them fed these guys got to be kept fed or they will just disappear

489
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:42,539
at all times read puddle slime puddle slimes aren't risky to manage they just require a fair

490
01:36:42,539 --> 01:36:46,619
bit of maintenance a rancher needs a pool of fresh water like a pond available for a puddle

491
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:51,350
slime and it's plorts to sit in as they will evaporate it away from water finally puddle

492
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:55,029
slimes are exceptionally shy and will not produce plorts if they're in close proximity more than

493
01:36:55,029 --> 01:37:01,689
three others hopes overall pulse time is barefoot yeah just sleepy okay so i have to i can only have

494
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:07,640
four ocean no no no no no no no come back here i don't want you to teleport out of reality all

495
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:21,989
right i'm not i gotta hold on to the quantum slimes for a little bit what's that i need to plant uh

496
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:35,699
garden we are replacing mint fruit with phase lemon in fact we are going to do two phase lemon

497
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:59,319
gardens folks this is right here they're right over there oh i said a bad idea it's they're

498
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:06,869
right here what's wrong with my brain i want i want a ton of production of that fruit i want

499
01:38:06,869 --> 01:38:23,060
to be able to constantly keep an auto feeder going on going on that thing mint fruit gang rebel

500
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:50,899
eat mint mangoes please read about echoes get rid of the cats already um okay hold on let me

501
01:38:54,340 --> 01:39:02,020
these guys eat fruit so i mean i could here's what we're going to do i that that that that that that

502
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:13,979
stop it quiet they eat fruit i'm going to just load this up we're going to put the quantum slimes

503
01:39:13,979 --> 01:39:39,640
in here and start production hey they eat fruit so i can fill that up they'll be eating here we go

504
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:46,470
plenty of food let's go way too many you're going to be in trouble how the fuck did you

505
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:50,630
how they why they're flying why are they floating away why are they floating away

506
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:53,829
give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me

507
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:18,229
why are they flying away feed them i was feeding them it's fake what oh wait i have 27 still

508
01:40:18,869 --> 01:40:38,140
all right feed feed them before they all leave hurry up and feed them with the auto feeder

509
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:58,119
feed them why's i'll do it these things are freaking me out they really are they're just

510
01:40:58,119 --> 01:41:05,750
spreading out everywhere all right i got gold plorts i got quantum plorts hell yeah

511
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:17,529
let's uh keep feeding gold plorts now i'm gonna do i need crystals or maybe another one maybe i'll

512
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:33,579
save it water then water quick water quick do i have to do i have to do this save how often do

513
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:45,560
i have to do that you don't need to do that if you keep them fed okay that's what we're gonna do

514
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:53,060
all right so that i got the i got all right i gotta keep that filled i'm gonna keep that

515
01:41:53,060 --> 01:42:00,359
filled up we're gonna go stuff it in there wow this game is like seriously can we give like

516
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:07,000
how do we get the developers of this game like a hundred million dollars to like make more stuff

517
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:27,380
like this okay looks good how much do these sell for that's what i want to know i'm very interested

518
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:33,029
in this all right let's go back for a sec i want to see what the quantum plorts sell for

519
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:39,539
and then i'm going to get crystal ports i'm gonna make maybe not is there is am i missing

520
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:55,079
the slime that's in there 118 is there another uh is there a new thing i can get i have so much

521
01:42:55,079 --> 01:43:12,470
money you never read what the echoes do that's that cool i'm kidding relax within the crumbling

522
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:17,750
walls of the ancient ruins small traces of energy can be found never staying in one place for very

523
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:23,670
long called echo ease they are believed to be a phenomenon resulting from some kind of ancient

524
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:28,310
event since they are harmless echoes are often collected by ranchers as good luck charms are

525
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:33,109
used as decorations echoes appear regularly in the nooks and crannies of the ancient ruins

526
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:38,470
as well as from extractors echoes can be used as decorations simply vac them up and shoot them

527
01:43:38,470 --> 01:44:02,149
anywhere you want they'll hover in that spot until you vac them up cool oh puddle porch

528
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:09,479
one two three four five seven eight nine eleven twelve do i sell these or hold on to them

529
01:44:09,479 --> 01:44:30,199
maybe i'll sell sell seven sell more more more i just need one two i need one all right i gotta

530
01:44:30,199 --> 01:44:34,359
go get another okay is there another slime in that area where it just was there's like a lava

531
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:54,069
slime or something right you have sugar hands guys all fed sugar hands there are more areas

532
01:44:54,069 --> 01:45:00,380
oh okay all right now this is what we're gonna do i'm gonna bring a shitload of meat and a shitload

533
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:07,850
of fruit what was the where are what were they it was this guy which is meat and then there's this

534
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:19,130
guy which was fruit he loves these things i'm gonna i'm gonna bring these and i need 15 of

535
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:37,270
these right there it is i can now feed that guy 25 shit okay when i said upgrade the seven z

536
01:45:37,270 --> 01:46:00,810

540
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:43,189
this will show up better i think i'll recognize that more i'd be like whoa it's uh it's got like

541
01:46:44,229 --> 01:47:02,329
red and green and it's got the huge okay yeah definitely that one ice cream cat yeah all right

542
01:47:02,329 --> 01:47:18,859
hi guys hello need to bring a lot of fruit no i don't what is the boom slimes favorite food

543
01:47:18,859 --> 01:47:29,270
briar hens okay how many briar hens do i have because i'm bringing a shitload what do you what's

544
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:43,270
it i need to keep one of these in case i need to grow them gold oh no no it was an awful joke what

545
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:48,699
joke i made a joke what joke did i make i wasn't aware of a joke what are you talking about what

546
01:47:48,699 --> 01:48:06,260
joke joke you said among us i didn't that is too what's going on you didn't what i don't know what

547
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:16,439
i did you didn't change them i didn't briar hens i have a lot of stony hens this is unfortunate

548
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:28,550
briar there we are briar hen briar hen

549
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:43,050
come here take all the briar hens we need to do this sorry i'm going to wipe out the entire

550
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:58,949
population so i need 25 hens right so therefore i need 10 i'm trying to calculate this how much

551
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:14,779
are the roosters worth roosters are worth more right how what do i need the rooster is not worth

552
01:49:14,779 --> 01:49:21,560
more they aren't well i could i could do with some clearing out here all right stony hen it is

553
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:28,180
no regular hens there's a lot of them running around i only need like two roosters per coop

554
01:49:28,819 --> 01:49:42,439
all right let's let's fucking get rid of them all right how you guys doing bad are you well fed

555
01:49:44,579 --> 01:50:01,449
we've got plenty of food over here so i need 17 right somebody said 17 regular hens

556
01:50:02,409 --> 01:50:47,079
okay is that right 17 8 that's enough right one escaped what everybody escaped what are we

557
01:50:47,079 --> 01:51:05,270
talking about who escaped everybody escaped is that real that's real what are they getting out

558
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:27,189
isn't there a net no i want how do they get out i don't know how you guys get out but whatever

559
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:50,729
they teleported out but why they're well fed you need to water them 31 all right i'm going to do

560
01:51:50,810 --> 01:52:21,319
those wait whatever all right come on hurry up i need these get away from that back in there not

563
01:52:49,079 --> 01:53:10,420
more fruit yeah fuck this i'll get more red hens on the way there yeah i mean come on now i can

565
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:32,760
big guys all right i'm ready i'm ready let's go i need to go this way to the quantum computer

566
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:41,159
realm to go up here i'm trying to remember where this whoa hello what the he's got like

567
01:53:41,159 --> 01:54:01,399
electrocuted like i'm okay i'm fine this way there's so many how do i make one of those drones

568
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:10,659
okay i need a drone now drone 12 quantum plorts i can make one right now yep i'm making a drone

569
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:39,140
watch out for the explosions you know what it's time to do this too fuck it's like rotting all

570
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:56,090
right we're doing everybody just stay still give me a second done i just hold on i'm making this

571
01:54:56,090 --> 01:55:02,500
i'm making this a phase 11 place but not this one maybe the other one i got i this is too much

572
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:08,260
it's way too much of this bullshit yeah i'm just that's i'm not doing that anymore

588
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:36,140
last before i was like oh man i wish i had some more plorts to work the fuck what if they're

589
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:44,789
gonna eat those it's fine thought i have too many 44 crystals i'm gonna leave those i don't need

590
01:59:44,789 --> 01:59:55,239
them right now he's stuck in a loop i really am but it's a very very expensive loop for them to

591
01:59:55,239 --> 02:00:17,460
pay me i'm at 23 000 right now all right mario running up the stairs kind of all right now

592
02:00:18,579 --> 02:00:25,880
just scoop them up might as well okay i'm gonna get the last of the oka oka's on the other farm

593
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:48,840
replace it with a phase lemon and then be done with it i'll be done with it job never ends

594
02:00:50,550 --> 02:01:00,060
no it doesn't does it constant i need one of those buzzy bees right now okay wait i need rad

595
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:04,460
don't i how much did i need how much rad do i need i just sold all of it how much do i need for the

596
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:33,909
bee all right we're taking a full stack to the beat okay now i'm gonna go back to the lab we're

597
02:01:33,909 --> 02:01:42,010
gonna suck up um okay deposit ports suck up remaining oka oka's turn that into a phase lemon

598
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:59,850
crop center okay what do i need utility drone where the fuck do i get wild honey

599
02:02:00,489 --> 02:02:12,890
and do this but change style to actually change the style keep upgrading the seven z rewards

600
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:17,770
uh they do not see the cats are they they changed back they changed to the honey or did it

601
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:22,890
think you can debate me right now i just i saw the change in real time in the game world

602
02:02:27,579 --> 02:02:36,659
what do you think i am all right kill this crop remove crops phase lemon let's go more lemons

603
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:54,250
oka oka deposit oka oka into oka oka depository oka oka has been deposited oka oka deposit is

604
02:02:54,250 --> 02:03:14,899
complete oka oka is ready to be harvested oka oka is now in your inventory we're done see look

605
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:19,300
it changed these were cheshires before and they didn't have the honey thing on their head

606
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:36,279
oh each one of these is hiding from the other one they're all hiding from each other

607
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:59,579
quantums are all gone they better not be i'll be very upset with you well check on the quantums

608
02:04:02,729 --> 02:04:13,909
drop the chickens i i'm about to go feed the chickens they're not all gone they're here oh

609

615
02:05:49,020 --> 02:06:06,100
are you real all right we can keep that in there okay quantum port to sell some quantum ports

616
02:06:07,449 --> 02:06:22,939
yes sure i'll sell 25 of them and then i'm gonna leave finally with 26 thousand dollars

617
02:06:26,329 --> 02:07:00,739
more than that twenty seven thousand dollars bingo how do i do that how do i change my gun

618
02:07:00,739 --> 02:07:26,090
it's outside house cobalt oh no definitely strawberry milkshake oh yeah heck ranch house

619
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:37,109

639
02:12:50,569 --> 02:12:57,939
open and i was just looking at the phase level i was i was so excited to like just i can't wait

640
02:12:57,939 --> 02:13:02,340
to go feed this guy i can't wait to feed him i don't i don't want any more of these

641
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:09,140

680
02:21:58,549 --> 02:22:09,000
sell these ports wait i'm gonna put these ports into the machine is there i don't i don't see

681
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:24,170
the food is piling up i miss a read i don't see one oh big hall

steam would come out of my ears my face would turn like green you'd hear a big choo-choo train

684
02:22:46,139 --> 02:23:01,940
phase limit i mean what if i get wild honey all right i got 50 phase lemons let's go

685
02:23:02,420 --> 02:23:09,239
dump them in there and then i'm bringing i have enough oh i'm so annoyed i just keep seeing the

763
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:29,100
to connect to one of the most distant corners of the far far range be careful beatrix

764
02:43:29,979 --> 02:43:35,500
once you cross over you'll be in truly untamed country the beautiful the other side can be an

765
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:47,159
unforgiving place oh okay all right activate it oh we got a fill with quantum quantum plorts

766
02:43:48,329 --> 02:43:58,340

822
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:51,540
i came to the far far range because a search for the unknown is in my bones

823
03:04:52,549 --> 03:04:57,450
and in time even a thousand light years away from earth wasn't enough so i searched for secrets

824
03:04:57,450 --> 03:05:08,069
within the ancient ruins that led me here this place was my ticket to go even further there's

825
03:05:08,069 --> 03:05:15,989
door left or right the ruins are actually great engines that allow for travel through space and

826
03:05:15,989 --> 03:05:22,170
maybe even time after years of study i knew how to activate them and i alone would be the first

827
03:05:22,170 --> 03:05:28,649
to cross over into the true beyond it was the ultimate adventure but then there's that other

828
03:05:28,649 --> 03:05:34,409
door i met thor and fell in love what are the chances of that she had a piece of my heart and

829
03:05:34,409 --> 03:05:42,889
the universe had the other two doors beatrix all right that one has like a space pod in it

830
03:05:42,889 --> 03:05:59,059
what's this one have it's the same door it's actually the same door at least the same place

831
03:05:59,059 --> 03:06:18,149
the same door didn't have to choose it's actually the and we've got weird pork you pine fruits

832
03:06:18,790 --> 03:06:41,610
i need to fill my water i chose my door i went back to the ranch and promptly sold it

833
03:06:41,610 --> 03:06:45,850
i packed my things and took a tour of this beautiful land one last time leaving these

834
03:06:45,850 --> 03:06:51,129
little notes for you there's time i said goodbye to the get your fucking mouse off the screen life

835
03:06:51,129 --> 03:06:56,979
i had my hands and feet tingled as i approached this monolithic warp terminal what lay ahead of

836
03:06:56,979 --> 03:07:03,219
me was an adventure unlike anything i'd ever known in my life stepped on the platform my heart racing

837
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:18,549
but i didn't go i had packed for a new adventure but it wasn't going to be beyond space and time

838
03:07:19,639 --> 03:07:22,840
so i said a little goodbye to what could have been and headed to thor's ranch

839
03:07:23,559 --> 03:07:28,489
i'm looking forward to hearing the sound of those wind chimes i've never been in love before and

840
03:07:28,489 --> 03:07:34,420
never known anything yet you're fucking up my goddamn monologue i like it it's time i got to

841
03:07:34,420 --> 03:07:39,940
knowing what all the fuss is about so good luck to you beatrix as always remember to use your head

842
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:49,340
but let your heart do the thinking every now and again it might surprise you well i chose my door

843
03:07:49,979 --> 03:08:12,739
it didn't work out though choose the door there is i you know i think this guy got to the end

844
03:08:12,739 --> 03:08:18,100
and realized there's nothing here and then decided to write this uh yeah i chose there's nothing here

845
03:08:18,100 --> 03:08:20,979
there's supposed to be like a teleporter leading to like another time period or something

846
03:08:20,979 --> 03:08:26,569
nothing here but uh i guess i'm gonna have to like say that they was my adventure along the way

847
03:08:27,129 --> 03:08:40,020
just leave breadcrumbs and say like yeah i chose my door you choose your door uh there's a giant

848
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:44,180
x on the ground there is no treasure on the ground beatrix no treasure in there i've already looked

849
03:08:45,190 --> 03:08:55,500
the map is fucking useless all right get rid of the hens i want whatever this is a cool pair

850
03:08:56,139 --> 03:09:05,639
i'd want if you chose your door is that all that's over here i think that's all i can do

851
03:09:06,780 --> 03:09:12,840
cool all right well i chose there's a huge beam on it though i don't believe that

852
03:09:13,479 --> 03:09:37,930
go check your emails no it's the same door no what they're trying to say is all paths might

853
03:09:37,930 --> 03:09:54,120
lead to the same outcome you still got there i'm really kind of disappointed there's no

854
03:09:54,120 --> 03:10:00,069

931
03:24:43,159 --> 03:24:54,299
All right. Look at that later. I'm putting dervish slimes in here get an incinerator

932
03:24:56,299 --> 03:24:58,299
I don't have any room on this plot

933
03:24:58,579 --> 03:25:12,989
Should I just delete this and put an incinerator here? I think I'm gonna do that. I think so. It's time

934
03:25:13,510 --> 03:25:15,479
guys wait

935
03:25:15,479 --> 03:25:19,520
Let me clear this out first to make sure nothing in here suck all this up

03:26:43,129 --> 03:26:45,129
It's money is everywhere

943
03:26:45,610 --> 03:26:51,620
Too many quantum escape artists. I don't know. Okay, I have 50 quantum ports

944
03:26:53,139 --> 03:26:55,139
Sell them I'm gonna sell everything

945
03:26:55,700 --> 03:27:02,659
Get drones. I need the honey to get hold on make a teleporter to the dock. I will after I'm let me just do this

946
03:27:03,340 --> 03:27:21,100
Make it to square one. I need an apiary. Okay

947
03:27:33,100 --> 03:27:44,969
Get rid of the boom cats. Yeah boom cats are gonna go away and I can replace it with dervishes

948
03:27:45,530 --> 03:27:50,860
Yes, good idea. I hope somebody likes vegetables

949
03:27:51,020 --> 03:28:32,530
I

950
03:28:32,530 --> 03:28:52,059
Broke his neck. How are you coming back? Here's my plan. Here's my plan

951
03:28:55,260 --> 03:29:03,670
Okay, good. We are gonna see we're gonna be very very careful here. What do the fire slime?

952
03:29:15,780 --> 03:29:37,579
Dead okay, I'm gonna make this an incinerator and we're gonna keep this and put fire slimes in here to see what happens

953
03:29:37,659 --> 03:29:50,219
Good plan. I like that plan. Goodbye incinerator

954
03:29:51,219 --> 03:30:00,909
An ash troll allows you to collect the ash of incinerated food at its base, which is eaten exclusive. I blow

955
03:30:07,200 --> 03:30:10,719
Accidentally just created exactly what we needed and

956
03:30:11,559 --> 03:30:15,799
Got an email from Casey. Hi Casey. What can I do for you? Hold on?

957
03:30:15,799 --> 03:30:20,159
I'll reach your email in one second. Apparently just murdering some cat slimes

958
03:30:21,120 --> 03:31:06,200
I ain't saying all right these guys you better not fucking kill me get away from me. This is so dangerous

959
03:31:06,200 --> 03:31:11,760
Oh my god. Oh

960
03:31:16,129 --> 03:31:31,719
My god, you little dicks. I swear to god

961
03:31:31,719 --> 03:31:53,299
I'm so glad to get rid of these things feed them feed them to incinerate them

962
03:31:53,299 --> 03:32:20,979
That doesn't make any sense ahead. All right, we have successfully eliminated the least by least favorite person in the game. Here we go

963
03:32:20,979 --> 03:32:25,899
What does it normal food? I've got anything in there

964
03:32:26,459 --> 03:32:42,170
Lean that out. Oh, these went up in value. Oh shit. Nice. Okay fire slimes going in here

965
03:32:42,530 --> 03:32:53,219
So fire slimes eat. Let's take a look at the slime a pedia. They eat ash

966
03:32:53,899 --> 03:32:57,229
They live on ash

967
03:32:57,469 --> 03:33:00,549
Delete just about any food, but not without it being burnt to ash first

968
03:33:01,190 --> 03:33:03,590
Use an incinerator with an ash throw

969
03:33:04,309 --> 03:33:12,389
Upgrade our slimes need ash to survive and will quickly snuff out if left on any other surface for too long

970
03:33:12,709 --> 03:33:21,379
When keeping fire slimes and an ash throw simply burn any food item to put wait they go into the fire thing

971
03:33:21,780 --> 03:33:35,799
They go in here

972
03:33:35,799 --> 03:33:51,149
Well, I just placed them. That's like that's annoying

973
03:33:51,790 --> 03:34:03,809
Okay, I need to burn food. How many can be in here three or four. I need ash. Okay

974
03:34:07,920 --> 03:34:28,760
They're working already full how can I tell one escape

975
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:39,239
Um

976
03:34:39,239 --> 03:34:46,489
Upgraded it's already upgraded. Okay. Can I have four in here?

977
03:34:46,489 --> 03:34:59,620
And what can I have as many as I want in here or is the limit as many as you want?

978
03:34:59,899 --> 03:35:03,420
All right. How do I collect this?

979
03:35:03,659 --> 03:35:09,239
Fire ploy nice. Oh, this is gonna be swell

980
03:35:09,920 --> 03:35:16,129
Make sure you feed them. Is there like an ash meter? Oh

981
03:35:33,920 --> 03:35:38,049
We're in any food item to produce some ash and fill the tro. Oh

982
03:35:43,700 --> 03:35:45,700
I see. Okay, I get it

983
03:35:46,180 --> 03:35:51,280
It's just it's just a sand. Okay, I get it. I get it. I get it cool

984
03:35:51,760 --> 03:36:03,559
How much of these worth very nice? All right, so then what I can put Dervish slimes in here

985
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:25,329
Will they be mad about that? Okay, so should I can I feed a fire plort to a Dervish plort?

986
03:36:25,850 --> 03:36:37,520
Cool. No fire plorts just worth just money

987
03:36:38,120 --> 03:36:40,120
Okay, cool. So these guys what are these guys like?

988
03:36:40,559 --> 03:36:48,639
Oracle pair is their favorite a Dervish lime is a swirling whirling bundle of energy in a slimy form

989
03:36:49,120 --> 03:36:53,889
Dervish slimes are commonly found in the glass desert cruising across the dusty dunes at high speed atop little whirlwinds

990
03:36:54,290 --> 03:36:58,329
One thing's for certain wherever the Dervish slime needs to go. It needs to get the tickets or it goes quickly

991
03:36:59,250 --> 03:37:03,569
Dervish slimes can cause total chaos on a ranch if not cared for properly

992
03:37:03,729 --> 03:37:09,200
in addition to frequently riding atop whirlwinds at high speed and collecting objects along the way a

993
03:37:10,120 --> 03:37:16,920
Highly agitated Dervish slime can produce giant cyclones of air and vacuum up and toss about anything they touch

994
03:37:17,959 --> 03:37:22,219
Cyclones are roaring across your ranch. There's little you can do other than brace for the chaos. Oh god

995
03:37:26,079 --> 03:37:33,319
Okay, but keep them happy. They love prickle pairs. I know what I'm doing

996
03:37:38,719 --> 03:37:50,860
They eat well, we'll just keep them happy for a second here. Oh

997
03:38:00,809 --> 03:38:02,049
Plarts

998
03:38:02,049 --> 03:38:15,469
How's this Ash doing? Pretty good. Pretty good. Okay, suck it up

999
03:38:21,959 --> 03:38:23,440
Dervish plort

1000
03:38:23,479 --> 03:38:34,860
I'm assuming Dervish and quantum is what to do. Is there a way I can reliably get these out without sucking these guys up

1001
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:48,829
All right, we're changing this move the crops

1002
03:38:49,469 --> 03:38:53,399
We what do I want in here a prickled a prickled pear

1003
03:38:53,959 --> 03:39:12,329
Where is it a prickle Rick?

1004
03:39:18,239 --> 03:39:20,239
Here you go your favorite food

1005
03:39:20,559 --> 03:39:30,799
All right. So now

1006
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:36,629
It'll be okay for a little while. We'll get that shit to grow. They got food. How are you guys doing?

1007
03:39:36,629 --> 03:39:38,629
I'm gonna refill this throw

1008
03:39:43,299 --> 03:39:46,180
A lot of you guys I need a bumblebee thing to refill this

1009
03:39:46,899 --> 03:39:50,530
It's got to be a better way to do that

1010
03:39:50,530 --> 03:39:58,559
All right

1011
03:39:58,559 --> 03:39:59,680
Oh

1012
03:39:59,680 --> 03:40:05,409
Okay

1013
03:40:05,409 --> 03:40:07,569
Don't do it for you. He's doing this on purpose

1014
03:40:08,549 --> 03:40:10,549
Roth throw whatever

1015
03:40:11,459 --> 03:40:12,739
frog

1016
03:40:12,739 --> 03:40:19,729
I despise you

1017
03:40:19,729 --> 03:40:25,719
I think that's kind of harsh man. Are you though? Really? I'm sorry. Why?

1018
03:40:27,010 --> 03:40:29,010
All right, i'm gonna do

1019
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:33,360
I want to combine something here

1020
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:40,840
Look at all those floors. Hell, yeah

1021
03:40:46,440 --> 03:40:49,879
They don't have any food in here and they want prickly pears

1022
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:52,719
All right

1023
03:40:52,719 --> 03:40:59,010
I'll give you ten dollars to pour you maple syrup down your pants pockets

1024
03:40:59,809 --> 03:41:03,440
These pants bought I think these pants were more than ten dollars. So it'd have to be way more than that

1025
03:41:04,239 --> 03:41:13,120
But I would just ruin these pants

1026
03:41:13,120 --> 03:41:15,120
All right. These guys are

1027
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:23,030
I'm a toy. All right. What are they? Uh, what are they like? What kind of toys do they like a buzzy b?

1045
03:42:38,159 --> 03:42:39,200
inventory

1046
03:42:39,200 --> 03:42:40,959
I didn't do that on purpose

1047
03:42:40,959 --> 03:42:54,600
Keep this shit over here for a minute

1048
03:43:01,590 --> 03:43:05,559

1053
03:43:29,159 --> 03:43:33,079
Maybe the year we both came home. Do you ever think we'll have whatever it doesn't matter

1054
03:43:33,079 --> 03:43:36,280
I should have told you then what I never did. I should have said it a hundred times

1055
03:43:36,360 --> 03:43:38,360
I think about all the time that if we had been best

1056
03:43:38,840 --> 03:43:42,920
Honest about it. We how might still be running on that garden shop and i'll be writing music in the basement

1057
03:43:43,479 --> 03:44:14,719
You guys eat a lot

1058
03:44:14,719 --> 03:44:22,440
You guys eat too much. All right, we're gonna thin this out a little

1059
03:44:26,600 --> 03:44:28,600
We don't need that many. Okay, I took out four

1060
03:44:29,159 --> 03:44:32,610
let's have

1061
03:44:32,610 --> 03:44:35,520
We'll do

03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:37,840
One two, three, four five six six is okay

1063

1064
03:44:43,430 --> 03:44:44,950
Just destroy

1065
03:44:44,950 --> 03:44:48,659
Put them in the water

1066
03:44:48,659 --> 03:44:52,760
These guys have food

1067
03:44:52,760 --> 03:44:57,520
Put them in storage. You can't store a fire slime

1068
03:45:10,739 --> 03:45:13,750
All right, that's good

1069
03:45:13,750 --> 03:45:15,750
He's ready. They are ready

1070
03:45:16,870 --> 03:45:18,149
Very cool

1071
03:45:18,149 --> 03:45:26,079
Now we'll get double

1073
03:45:29,299 --> 03:45:32,899
I have a lot of points. I'm gonna I think i'm gonna store these or something. How much are they?

Quantum slimes love puzzle cubes

1100
03:47:34,159 --> 03:47:36,000
Oh, I don't

1101
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:38,000

I would appreciate if you guys got back in the thing though, whatever

1109

You'll know you'll just die or whatever and I only need like four you anyways

1110
03:48:40,760 --> 03:48:51,250
Look, uh

1111
03:48:51,250 --> 03:48:54,450
The next thing i'm going to do is get a bunch of drones

1112
03:48:55,090 --> 03:48:58,610
To have them do all this work. That's next that's coming up now

1113
03:48:59,409 --> 03:49:01,590
So let's do some selling

1114
03:49:01,590 --> 03:49:06,629
How much is this worth fire ploys are worth 51. That's it. Dervish is worth 74

1115
03:49:07,590 --> 03:49:16,799
I need quantum ploys. Don't I save them?

1116
03:49:23,010 --> 03:49:25,010
The pairs are going over here

1117
03:49:32,469 --> 03:49:43,059
These guys love this shit what about the quests

1118
03:49:43,620 --> 03:49:46,950
The quests haven't really been that good

1119
03:49:47,510 --> 03:49:53,079
They've been kind of lame

1120
03:49:53,079 --> 03:50:00,120
But I you want for for a fucking two turkeys four strawberries and 250 bucks. This is worthless

1121
03:50:04,479 --> 03:50:09,040
All right. I'm gonna go deposit this stuff and take a look at what I need to figure out how to do these drones

1122
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:10,639

03:53:50,709 --> 03:53:52,309
Well, I did it already

1152

03:54:49,219 --> 03:54:51,940
Uh, you i'll throw this into the fire

1159
03:54:52,579 --> 03:54:57,879
You guys got food?

1160
03:54:57,879 --> 03:55:11,360
You do? Okay. Good

1161
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:13,440
Uh, I don't I just don't I don't even want this

1162
03:55:14,079 --> 03:55:17,350
Okay now

1163
03:55:17,350 --> 03:55:19,969
I just lost everything. I was just doing what am I doing?

1164
03:55:20,610 --> 03:55:24,389
I just lost everything forget everything. What was I doing?

1165
03:55:25,030 --> 03:55:30,690
I was about to go and oh it put apiary, right?

1166
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:44,100
I still have the gold

1167
03:55:49,489 --> 03:55:51,489
Up here. We need to we're gonna teleport

1168
03:55:52,850 --> 03:55:55,170
I think I know what i'm doing

1169
03:55:55,809 --> 03:56:13,700
I think I know what i'm doing. I think it's eating right? Yeah

1170
03:56:14,819 --> 03:56:31,889
Okay through this teleporter

1171
03:56:32,209 --> 03:56:39,639
And they're gonna put apiaries everywhere how much of your blood is heal at any moment?

1172
03:56:41,010 --> 03:56:44,209
Um, I don't know it depends. Okay. Let's say I had a heal in the morning

1173
03:56:46,719 --> 03:56:47,680
that's

1174
03:56:47,680 --> 03:56:48,799
What?

1175
03:56:48,799 --> 03:56:50,799
16 ounces of heal

1176
03:56:52,389 --> 03:56:57,110
Which how does that get into my bloodstream does it goes in my stomach from my esophagus into my stomach

1177
03:56:57,750 --> 03:57:01,409
and then down into my intestines and everything and absorbed

1178
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:05,299
so

1179
03:57:05,299 --> 03:57:08,739
I don't know over the course of the day. I don't know what I would be like maybe like

1180
03:57:10,370 --> 03:57:20,040
1.2 1.4 percent heal at any given moment. All right, we're gonna put them all here

1181
03:57:23,219 --> 03:57:34,930
Apiary you

1182
03:57:35,170 --> 03:57:47,030
Okay, then up here. Oh, i'm sorry that hurt you

1183
03:57:47,590 --> 03:58:01,809
All right. So that's one two, three, four five six

1184
03:58:03,959 --> 03:58:06,260
12 minutes

1185
03:58:06,260 --> 03:58:08,600
Until I can come collect

1186
03:58:08,600 --> 03:58:31,040
In the meantime, we're gonna go sell a bunch of stuff. What do you think of fuel? Is it yummy genuinely curious?

1187
03:58:32,290 --> 03:58:34,690
Uh, I can give you my review of all three flavors

1188
03:58:35,719 --> 03:58:38,200
Uh chocolate is the best tasting out of the three

1189
03:58:39,799 --> 03:58:43,559
But unfortunately it is also the thickest of the three

1190
03:58:44,899 --> 03:58:46,020
so

1191
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:50,579
If you want to sip on something for a long time, it's kind of like a it's it has the consistency of a milkshake

1192
03:58:50,659 --> 03:58:52,180
It's pretty thick

1193
03:58:52,180 --> 03:58:53,860
Tastes the best though

1194
03:58:53,860 --> 03:58:55,059
vanilla

1195
03:58:55,059 --> 03:58:59,379
Is it a decent flavor? It's probably I'd say it's second. Maybe it's a tie between berry and vanilla

1196
03:58:59,780 --> 03:59:04,159
The only the problem that I have with vanilla is it has kind of a weird

1197
03:59:04,940 --> 03:59:06,690
consistency

1198
03:59:06,690 --> 03:59:09,969
It tends to have sort of a weird after texture in my mouth

1199
03:59:11,170 --> 03:59:15,159
It tastes great, but not my favorite now berry on the other hand

1200
03:59:15,889 --> 03:59:19,729
Berry on the other hand is a best of both worlds. It's thin enough to drink

1201
03:59:21,559 --> 03:59:24,600
So it's really easy to drink. It's thin. It's not super

1202
03:59:25,319 --> 03:59:27,569
Thick and heavy and it also tastes good

1203
03:59:27,569 --> 03:59:33,520
It tastes like a strawberry milkshake like almost like a berry gogurt or something. I'd say that's probably my favorite one

1204
03:59:34,000 --> 03:59:37,079
nobody asked

1205
03:59:38,040 --> 03:59:43,479
Yes, they did dead

1206
03:59:44,520 --> 03:59:46,520
A voice crack

1207
03:59:46,760 --> 03:59:48,530
Clip it

1208
03:59:48,530 --> 03:59:50,530
And put it under my bed

1209
03:59:51,040 --> 03:59:53,920
And the voice crack very will show up and give me five dollars

1210
03:59:56,790 --> 03:59:59,110
Okay time to sell a bunch of shit

1211
04:00:13,299 --> 04:00:16,799
I got 12 minutes. Tell me yell at me when 12 minutes has gone by

1212
04:00:30,680 --> 04:00:32,120
Oh

1213
04:00:32,120 --> 04:00:35,159
My god, what's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? Get that out of here?

1214
04:00:36,120 --> 04:00:38,120
Get that out of here. Go the other way

1215
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:40,520
Go the other direction

1216
04:00:48,260 --> 04:00:50,260
Who's doing that in there what the fuck is wrong with you

1217
04:00:52,049 --> 04:00:54,209
What's wrong with you in here?

1218
04:00:54,209 --> 04:00:57,959
Stop this shit

1219
04:00:57,959 --> 04:01:01,059
Why are they doing this?

1220
04:01:01,059 --> 04:01:04,340
They're hungry. The feeder is the feeder should be going

1230
04:02:15,729 --> 04:02:19,639
Why can't there be a gentle shoot?

1231
04:02:19,719 --> 04:02:22,280

Can you hold multiple stacks? I don't think you can you cannot

1335
04:15:31,059 --> 04:15:38,319
Do not believe you can

1336
04:15:38,319 --> 04:15:40,819
Do you guys have anything in here?

1337
04:15:40,979 --> 04:15:43,360

What's your problem?

1340
04:16:04,200 --> 04:16:09,399
Remember jokes are just family guy jokes. He just replaces the remember when to this is what happens. See I do

1341
04:16:19,139 --> 04:16:21,139
You still here aren't you?

04:16:21,379 --> 04:16:25,040
You must really like family guy and me

04:16:47,219 --> 04:16:53,360
Okay, well hold on how fair is that that means all referential humor is family guy I can't reference anything

1347
04:16:54,000 --> 04:17:01,190
Is that what they've cornered the market on anytime you can reference anything referential humor is not allowed because it's family guy

1348
04:17:02,069 --> 04:17:03,989
What would you prefer I do?

1349
04:17:03,989 --> 04:17:08,040
Those are the rules

1350
04:17:08,040 --> 04:17:24,290
All right, save these poop your pants

1351
04:17:30,770 --> 04:17:33,250
And what caliber of joke is poop your pants?

1353
04:17:41,350 --> 04:17:43,350

What is that? What's the poop? Where's what's poopoo?

1355
04:17:48,719 --> 04:17:50,559
I think that's um

1356
04:17:50,559 --> 04:18:06,200
Where does that fit on the scale of of uh humor of where we're how we're all right. We got a lot

1357
04:18:06,440 --> 04:18:11,299
It's very funny unless you do it

1358
04:18:25,239 --> 04:18:26,610
Oh

1359
04:18:26,610 --> 04:18:29,889
Allows you to remotely deposit resources into the refinery. Um

1360
04:18:31,649 --> 04:18:44,370
Yes, how do I get that?

1361
04:18:44,370 --> 04:18:46,370
All right time to go to

1362
04:18:46,450 --> 04:18:53,139
I gotta go this way. No this way. Where is it?

1363
04:18:54,309 --> 04:18:56,629
Uh, where do it's over here somewhere, right?

1364
04:18:57,270 --> 04:19:00,719
Where's that teleporter to get to the cat?

1365
04:19:01,120 --> 04:19:04,549
this way

1366
04:19:04,549 --> 04:19:11,299
Who the hell is that thing?

1367
04:19:11,299 --> 04:19:28,659
I've been streaming for four hours and 20 minutes. Oh nice

1368
04:19:30,479 --> 04:19:34,000

1370
04:19:36,319 --> 04:19:39,159

1401
04:22:30,209 --> 04:22:37,139
I don't know

1402
04:22:37,139 --> 04:22:39,139
Say dollars dollars

1403
04:22:39,360 --> 04:22:46,850

Say room. Yeah, go to go to you go to your room. Take clean up your room room room

1405
04:22:53,920 --> 04:22:55,920
He's a family guy streamer

1406
04:22:57,170 --> 04:23:01,329
I gotta go to my room and clean up on my car. He's not a family guy. He says family guy things

1407
04:23:01,409 --> 04:23:08,340
He's a family guy

1408
04:23:08,340 --> 04:23:17,159
He's so bad

1409
04:23:17,159 --> 04:23:19,639
All right. I can make a drone. Can I make more than one?

1410
04:23:20,600 --> 04:23:22,840
I just made one. What do I do with it?

1411
04:23:23,159 --> 04:23:39,459
Where is it? I have two drones

1412
04:23:41,250 --> 04:23:43,969
t oh

1413
04:23:43,969 --> 04:23:46,760
Okay. Um

1414
04:23:46,760 --> 04:23:48,600
What should I do with them?

1415
04:23:48,600 --> 04:24:01,780
Place it down. It's a gadget. Okay

1416
04:24:02,180 --> 04:24:05,639
Read the manual. Yeah, let me see if I can

1417
04:24:06,120 --> 04:24:12,680
All right, so if I

1418
04:24:12,680 --> 04:24:19,840
Drone a help learn more drones are a highly useful gadget that can reduce

1419
04:24:20,399 --> 04:24:23,920
Some of the work a rancher needs to perform on the ranch to keep things running smoothly

1420
04:24:24,639 --> 04:24:27,840
Once you build a drone simply give it a program using three simple inputs

1421
04:24:28,559 --> 04:24:31,520
target what the drone is looking for on your ranch

1422
04:24:32,319 --> 04:24:33,520
source

1423
04:24:33,520 --> 04:24:35,520
Where the drone gets its target?

1424
04:24:35,680 --> 04:24:37,920
Destination where the drone targets it takes its target

1425
04:24:38,559 --> 04:24:43,920
If you give a drone an impossible task or a drone simply cannot complete their task presently it'll go idle

1426
04:24:44,479 --> 04:24:48,819
A drone can run for about a day before it will return to its station. It must be powered again up again

1427
04:24:49,379 --> 04:24:51,860
Simply give it a refreshing blast of water to recharge it

1428
04:24:52,340 --> 04:24:56,739
The drone only works on your ranch and will only work within the ranch expansion in which you place it

1429
04:24:57,620 --> 04:25:00,979
Sometimes the drone will overflow an auto feeder

1430
04:25:01,540 --> 04:25:06,500
Or silo due to the bug in their software the 7c corporation insists. This bug is a feature

1431
04:25:06,979 --> 04:25:18,420
Am I fucking making you angry by talking like a guy from new england? This is all an act guys

1432
04:25:18,819 --> 04:25:22,319
This is that's how I normally talk. I'm I it takes me it's difficult to do this

1433
04:25:22,879 --> 04:25:31,350
I'm trying very hard not to talk like that as you can tell that's my real voice

1434
04:25:40,549 --> 04:25:43,829
Okay target what the drone is looking for on your now. I'm like gonna start doing it

1435
04:25:44,389 --> 04:25:49,559
What the drone where the drone gets its target where the drone takes its target?

1436
04:25:49,559 --> 04:25:54,479
So I want to take so target what the drone is looking for on the ranch

1437
04:25:55,120 --> 04:25:57,780
So if I put him down

1438
04:25:57,780 --> 04:26:02,000
Install let me see what this does

1439
04:26:02,719 --> 04:26:03,680
so

1440
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:05,680
activate target is gonna be

1441
04:26:08,129 --> 04:26:15,010
This is so cool. The target is gonna be

1442
04:26:16,840 --> 04:26:19,059
um

1443
04:26:19,059 --> 04:26:25,459
fruit the source will be from a garden and the destination is going to be

1444
04:26:26,760 --> 04:26:35,459
Auto feeders, but no what?

1445
04:26:38,920 --> 04:26:40,920
I don't want to just kind of go around and fly around do this

1446
04:26:41,559 --> 04:26:46,069
Get the fruit from the gardens, right?

1447
04:26:46,069 --> 04:26:49,090
Pick a specific fruit

1448
04:26:49,090 --> 04:26:51,799
Can I?

1449
04:26:51,799 --> 04:26:54,200
Okay, specific fruit. So you want to get

1450
04:26:55,940 --> 04:26:58,000
Prickle pear

1451
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:02,319
From a garden and put it into an auto feeder, but can I say specifically?

1452
04:27:02,959 --> 04:27:13,829
Can I say specific? I can't put this one. Does that matter? It'd be all fruit

1453
04:27:15,840 --> 04:27:17,360
Do all fruit

1454
04:27:17,360 --> 04:27:19,360
From a garden. That's what I did before everyone screamed at me

1455
04:27:25,139 --> 04:27:35,969
Let's see what he does

1456
04:27:35,969 --> 04:27:44,469
Wake up. Okay. Now I want to put uh veggies into the incinerator

1457
04:27:56,280 --> 04:27:58,959
target veggies

1458
04:27:59,200 --> 04:28:00,549
source

1459
04:28:00,549 --> 04:28:01,989
gardens

1460
04:28:01,989 --> 04:28:03,989
destination in the incinerator

1461
04:28:04,389 --> 04:28:05,350
activate

1462
04:28:05,350 --> 04:28:13,569
I need water. There's no fruit to collect

1463
04:28:14,370 --> 04:28:19,280
Yeah, there is this the prickly pear. I gotta get water. Hold on

1464
04:28:20,850 --> 04:28:32,520
Um, where's the fountain thing? It's like here somewhere, right? What's the water spout?

1465
04:28:33,159 --> 04:28:36,260
Do I not have one here?

1466
04:28:36,260 --> 04:28:38,899
I'm just gonna go to the pond

1467
04:28:38,899 --> 04:28:53,860

1558
04:38:20,080 --> 04:38:24,310

Well, I have one now

1639
04:47:33,029 --> 04:47:34,950
Do mosaic crystal?

1640
04:47:34,950 --> 04:47:36,950
Yeah, i'm gonna do mosaic crystal and then mosaic

1641
04:47:38,200 --> 04:47:56,659
Wind it'd be fun. Oh, what's that? What you say?

1642
04:47:57,459 --> 04:48:11,590
Another email from casey

04:48:11,590 --> 04:48:13,590
These guys are just going wild

1644
04:48:14,229 --> 04:48:18,069
Almost all as it okay. I don't care anymore

1645
04:48:19,200 --> 04:48:20,799
I don't even care anymore

1646
04:48:20,799 --> 04:48:26,040
I really don't I don't need quantum anymore

1647
04:48:26,680 --> 04:48:50,099
I'm just gonna store like one quantum plort and then these guys can just go free they get out too easily

1648
04:48:57,889 --> 04:49:01,729
Save one quantum plort in the event that I want to make a quantum

1649
04:49:14,630 --> 04:49:16,630
Of lemons, I need more pinks eventually

1650
04:49:17,349 --> 04:49:32,069
Get it

1651
04:49:32,069 --> 04:49:38,119

1655
04:49:47,400 --> 04:49:57,380
Homepage somebody said it. Wow, i'm surprised you got that a lot of you are getting that. Wow, that's interesting another tour

1656
04:49:57,459 --> 04:49:58,500
Hey b

1657
04:49:58,500 --> 04:50:01,400
There's another tour coming up and I have a feeling that this will be the one

1658
04:50:01,799 --> 04:50:03,639
Here I am packing my bags and thinking to you

1659
04:50:03,639 --> 04:50:06,520
Maybe this is how it felt when you were leaving for your big adventure lots of excitement

1660
04:50:06,919 --> 04:50:09,909
I keep thinking that maybe i'll catch you somewhere out there in the crowd

1661
04:50:10,389 --> 04:50:14,720
Whatever happens. I promise i'll sing a song for you. All right casey. Thank you

1662
04:50:15,680 --> 04:50:20,069
Wait, what he just took a moment to reflect

1663
04:50:20,389 --> 04:50:25,009
He thought about hobson and thora and the adventures he'd had exploring the far far range

1664
04:50:26,099 --> 04:50:29,700
Most of all, she thought of casey and wondered where life would take her next like at the end

1665
04:50:29,939 --> 04:50:31,939
Am I getting like enrage timered?

1666
04:50:38,290 --> 04:50:40,290
I just hit the enrage timer in the game

1667
04:50:48,450 --> 04:50:57,159
what

1668
04:50:58,130 --> 04:50:59,650
I took too long

1669
04:50:59,650 --> 04:51:01,650
I took too long. Are you serious?

1670
04:51:05,540 --> 04:51:08,740
I'm like i'm gonna go get these slimes over here. I'm gonna go do this one. I'm gonna do that one

1671
04:51:09,779 --> 04:51:12,580
No, i'm done. I hit the games and rage timer

1672
04:51:14,659 --> 04:51:16,740
No, it's then. Yeah, it's it. No, that's fine

1673
04:51:17,860 --> 04:51:19,860
It takes like in 40 days or whatever

1674
04:51:20,500 --> 04:51:21,939
You do this

1675
04:51:21,939 --> 04:51:25,939
And the game kind of ends and you can keep playing. I yeah, that's definitely what it is

1676
04:51:27,299 --> 04:51:29,349
Hey chris lum

1677
04:51:29,349 --> 04:51:32,310
What a god of a game designer. I love this game. It was fantastic

1678
04:51:34,819 --> 04:51:36,819
Hey, hey game development studios

1679
04:51:37,060 --> 04:51:38,419
just

1680
04:51:38,419 --> 04:51:42,500
Give that person a hundred million fucking dollars for the next game do it

1681
04:51:43,540 --> 04:51:45,540
Again, I want investors on there

1682
04:51:58,150 --> 04:52:01,990
Whatever okay, whatever budget you were gonna put into the next call of duty give it to this guy

1683
04:52:03,349 --> 04:52:05,430
I'd give it a hundred million dollars

1684
04:52:13,000 --> 04:52:17,639
Don't limit creativity with contracts. Let them do what they want. Oh, they would be no strings attached

1685
04:52:17,799 --> 04:52:20,840
If I had a hundred if I had a billion dollars right now

1686
04:52:23,319 --> 04:52:27,720
I would be writing checks left and right like I don't even fucking care if you pay me back just make something cool

1687
04:52:29,540 --> 04:52:32,500
And then I would pace around my living room for four years until it came out

1688
04:52:49,669 --> 04:53:00,419
Isn't that what death stranding was I have no idea, I don't know cool. All right. Well

1689
04:53:00,979 --> 04:53:03,990
I'm just kind of in the middle of something

1690
04:53:05,970 --> 04:53:13,880
Wait, do the credits take more than 12 minutes because my apiaries are probably done be brave pile of shit

1691
04:53:14,279 --> 04:53:33,009
Oh cool. All right, let's sleep

1692
04:53:33,009 --> 04:53:35,400
Hello there. Thanks taking you to the old ranch

1693
04:53:36,040 --> 04:53:39,189
I've acted wait a minute. It's a little thank you

1694
04:53:39,189 --> 04:53:43,029
I've activated three secret vaults that I built years ago to stash a small fortune

1695
04:53:46,529 --> 04:53:49,169
You know me. I like a good adventure. I'm not telling you where the vaults are located

1696
04:53:52,959 --> 04:53:56,639
slime key

1697
04:53:56,639 --> 04:54:00,639
Single spare slime key just in case you can't seem to find the last one

1698
04:54:01,360 --> 04:54:03,299
Okay, what?

1699
04:54:03,299 --> 04:54:11,409
How many you'll never find it? No, probably not

1700
04:54:12,049 --> 04:54:15,060
all right, let me uh

1701
04:54:15,060 --> 04:54:18,080
Let me store this and then we'll keep we'll do the thing. I want to go um

1702
04:54:18,959 --> 04:54:46,180
I'm gonna go back to that crystal world. I have water the teleport to the crystal world and then i'm just going and with empty

1703
04:54:46,900 --> 04:54:55,299
The lead dev musician and artist of this game made spiral nights a free mmo on steam

1704
04:54:55,299 --> 04:54:57,619
It's very fun. It's the exact same atmosphere. Please try it

1705
04:54:58,599 --> 04:55:02,599
You usually get to the boss in two to three streams spin up there over time. Oh, well, okay, cool

1706
04:55:03,400 --> 04:55:14,630
Why have I heard that name before?

1707
04:55:14,630 --> 04:55:16,599
All right, we're going

1708
04:55:16,599 --> 04:55:19,639
Where's the teleporter to get here? I feel like this is ridiculous

1709
04:55:20,439 --> 04:55:21,959
Where's the port here?

1710
04:55:21,959 --> 04:55:23,560
I'm way too far away

1711
04:55:23,560 --> 04:55:39,200
I don't want to walk all the way over here. This is that's just a one way to I have to walk here

1712
04:55:39,840 --> 04:55:44,020
I have to build one. Oh shit. I'm definitely not doing that

1713
04:55:45,139 --> 04:55:47,779
That's not happening on this stream. I guarantee it. I'm telling you for real

1714
04:55:49,880 --> 04:55:51,880
Uh here listen

1715
04:55:53,250 --> 04:55:55,250
Uh, we're gonna get to this part here

1716
04:55:55,330 --> 04:56:00,720
I'm gonna clean up a little bit. I'm gonna make the slimes. I want to make I want to make a mosaic crystal

1717
04:56:01,119 --> 04:56:03,119
And I want to make a mosaic wind

1718
04:56:03,759 --> 04:56:08,959
And then i'm gonna make some money i'm gonna buy i'm gonna open this this game is

1719
04:56:09,439 --> 04:56:32,340
Uh, no, i'm not gonna make that joke because I love it. Just move to boston the beer here sucks

1720
04:56:41,060 --> 04:56:44,419
Well, sorry to hear that try the cider it's it's way better

1721
04:56:49,590 --> 04:56:51,590
That doesn't make me mad or anything though

1722
04:56:51,750 --> 04:56:55,909
I don't have some attachment to

1723
04:56:57,009 --> 04:57:02,259
boston beer

1724
04:57:02,259 --> 04:57:06,020
What'd that guy say what the fuck that dude just say you don't like boston beer

1725
04:57:06,659 --> 04:57:23,189
What kind of fucking beer you drink? Oh, I don't care. Yes

1726
04:57:30,680 --> 04:57:32,680
It's lime fossil three of them

1727
04:57:33,400 --> 04:57:35,669
Hope I have enough room

1728
04:57:35,669 --> 04:57:41,360
Carry what I want to carry

1729
04:57:41,360 --> 04:57:44,819
That suck

1730
04:57:44,819 --> 04:57:50,900
Yeah, and tom brady won the super bowl on another team. I know i've and gronkowski's on that team and shit

1731
04:57:50,979 --> 04:57:52,979
I know I get it. It's like

1732
04:57:53,299 --> 04:57:54,740
I don't care though

1733
04:57:54,740 --> 04:58:02,419
I mean, I cared I cared when

1734
04:58:04,479 --> 04:58:06,479
when tom brady left the patriots it was like

1735
04:58:07,669 --> 04:58:18,000
Oh tom is this new kid coming up this new kid coming i'll get a fucking cannon for now

1736
04:58:18,720 --> 04:58:35,169
What do you even need tom anymore?

1737
04:58:35,169 --> 04:58:37,569
No, what we're doing we're gonna build up our farm system. We're gonna do

1738
04:58:39,040 --> 04:58:41,119
Take a couple years sub 500. It's fine. It's okay

1739
04:58:42,000 --> 04:58:44,000
Our farm system is gonna come up

1740
04:58:48,549 --> 04:58:51,669
All about farm system the farm system our farm system

1741
04:58:56,610 --> 04:59:01,330
And I mean that person has not watched a single minor league game at all or a college game

1742
04:59:01,889 --> 04:59:06,180
Our minor league system is our farm our farm system is great. I love our farm

1743
04:59:09,970 --> 04:59:11,970
We got we got tomatoes

1744
04:59:12,049 --> 04:59:19,060
Uh chili peppers

1745
04:59:19,060 --> 04:59:22,180
Yeah, hopefully hopefully Pedro martinez can pee into the ground

1746
04:59:28,400 --> 04:59:32,290
He was the best

1747
04:59:32,290 --> 04:59:45,189
All right that way

1748
04:59:45,189 --> 04:59:47,189
gronk ball

1749
04:59:49,860 --> 04:59:55,700
Didn't gronk used to spike balls into the ground and they would explode or am I making him up and making him a superhero?

1750
04:59:56,259 --> 05:00:01,509
I don't why I have this memory of gronk spiking a ball in the end zone and it exploded

1751
05:00:02,150 --> 05:00:06,369
Did I said that that was a dream?

1752
05:00:10,450 --> 05:00:12,930
That must have been right after we won in two one eight fifteen

1753
05:00:13,889 --> 05:00:16,259
I gotta go this way all the way around

1754
05:00:18,900 --> 05:00:24,790
Gronk in the rumble. No, i'm not gonna put gronkowski in the germ of rumble. Why?

1755
05:00:33,220 --> 05:00:35,220
That was mr. Superbowl

1756
05:00:35,959 --> 05:00:40,919
From blitz the league two not even a real person not even a real game

1757
05:00:42,950 --> 05:00:46,470
That's that's what it was. Okay. Well, you can tell how much I pay attention to football

1758
05:00:48,520 --> 05:00:51,240
I played that I streamed that and that was one of the things you could do

1759
05:00:55,029 --> 05:00:55,990
right

1760
05:00:55,990 --> 05:01:07,909
We're not even talking about that gronk. We're talking about the one from spore

1761
05:01:09,319 --> 05:01:10,680
You are

1762
05:01:10,680 --> 05:01:16,290
Did I go off on a football thing for no reason you guys talking about gronk from spore?

1763
05:01:28,119 --> 05:01:36,310
there

1764
05:01:38,759 --> 05:01:41,860
Tom brady

1765
05:01:41,860 --> 05:01:46,580
You know like here's the thing. I'm like tom brady. Wow, the new england patriots. He won so many times

1766
05:01:47,060 --> 05:01:52,419
What a legacy tom brady the best football team ever dynasty, right?

1767
05:01:52,900 --> 05:01:57,110
But part of me kind of wanted him to throw like 40 interceptions in that game

1768
05:01:58,080 --> 05:02:00,229
You know

1769
05:02:00,229 --> 05:02:09,139
He didn't like part of me wanted every single pet one of his passes to get intercepted and break every single wet record

1770
05:02:09,220 --> 05:02:10,580
a hundred times

1771
05:02:10,580 --> 05:02:16,680
It's the most unbelievable thing we've ever seen at the super bowl every single pass attempt by tom brady has been intercepted and run

1772
05:02:16,680 --> 05:02:19,080
Back for a touchdown

1773
05:02:19,080 --> 05:02:24,659
This has never happened before ever in the history of all sports. I'd be like, oh, that's fucking kind of funny

1774
05:02:25,619 --> 05:02:34,130
The other team is up by I don't even know what the other team it was there's the buccaneers and somebody else the

1775
05:02:37,060 --> 05:02:40,389
Kings, I don't know why the kings the kings

1776
05:02:42,580 --> 05:02:46,950
The chiefs, okay. Why did I say kings or whatever?

1777
05:02:55,000 --> 05:02:57,880
Okay, anyways, they would be up by like 200 points

1778
05:02:59,599 --> 05:03:02,319
And they would do the thing right before they go to commercial break with tom brady

1779
05:03:03,020 --> 05:03:06,639
Screams fuck as loud as he can and it's very clearly. That's what he did

1780
05:03:07,860 --> 05:03:11,220
It's a kind of a close-up. He's sitting on the bench. He spits he spits twice

1781
05:03:12,040 --> 05:03:14,040
Dumps water all over his head and he goes

1782
05:03:14,439 --> 05:03:18,599
Fuck i've seen that so many times

1783
05:03:19,159 --> 05:03:30,549
He's like after like the 25th interception in a row. What would he what would he do?

1784
05:03:31,189 --> 05:03:42,200
Okay, I need crystal slimes. I have water. I'm gonna get back that way water the plants

1785
05:03:42,759 --> 05:03:58,520
That's not doing anything

1786
05:03:58,520 --> 05:04:00,520
It needs special water

1787
05:04:02,310 --> 05:04:04,310
Need holy water. Okay, that's bullshit

1788
05:04:05,029 --> 05:04:20,479
It's new

1789
05:04:20,479 --> 05:04:22,479
Oh, no, I had beats already

1790
05:04:25,729 --> 05:04:28,419
What the fuck is going on in here?

1791
05:04:30,130 --> 05:04:42,639
What do you mean what's going on here drop kick a rotisserie chicken across

1792
05:04:45,599 --> 05:04:48,000
Uh, no, no one does the drop kick like doug flutie

1793
05:04:48,639 --> 05:04:51,380
When the only guys in football will do that

1794
05:04:52,020 --> 05:04:54,020
He drop kicked the ball

1795
05:04:54,099 --> 05:04:55,619
into the end zone

1796
05:04:55,619 --> 05:04:58,500
Past the uprights. No one's ever done that before doug flutie is the only one

1797
05:05:03,560 --> 05:05:09,400
Okay, here we go. So where are those mosaic ones?

1798
05:05:16,549 --> 05:05:19,970
They have a face. Where are they?

1799
05:05:19,970 --> 05:05:23,279
Underneath, okay

1800
05:05:23,279 --> 05:05:25,439
There we go. All right, so spray this guy with water

1801
05:05:33,919 --> 05:05:56,479
Uh, that's not that didn't do anything. You need holy water, dude. I where do you

1802
05:05:57,200 --> 05:06:06,319
Where am I supposed to get holy water? He needs to get a mosaic plort. Where do I get a mosaic plort?

1803
05:06:21,459 --> 05:06:23,459
Need mosaic slimes veggies

1804
05:06:25,060 --> 05:06:29,139
Yeah, and i've got to put a plort in there, but i haven't seen any mosaics slimes. Are they in this area?

1805
05:06:29,619 --> 05:06:32,099
Have I just missed them?

1806
05:06:32,099 --> 05:06:53,459
They show up at night or something. Thank god. I almost fell. All right. I need to get out of here. How do I get out of here?

1807
05:06:54,180 --> 05:06:59,110
Eat the gordo slime

1808
05:07:01,060 --> 05:07:02,099
Shit

1809
05:07:02,099 --> 05:07:18,360
I really thought I was gonna be able to get in here. Come on. Give me a crystal

1810
05:07:24,319 --> 05:07:35,939
Oh a mosaic. I mean damn it beat a big slime. I didn't come here with that. I I came here with the intention of

1811
05:07:36,740 --> 05:07:42,880
The intention was to fill up on oh man. That was painful

1812
05:07:43,680 --> 05:07:49,889
I have nothing to add. It's when I have had my message highlighted. Well, that's all right, man

1813
05:07:57,540 --> 05:08:16,099
It's nighttime. I don't see anything. It's nighttime though fill up that first fountain with rock plorts

1814
05:08:17,759 --> 05:08:21,729
Hmm

1815
05:08:56,389 --> 05:08:57,669
Read this

1816
05:08:57,669 --> 05:09:07,270
I hope something gets whatever that's a really mean thing to say

1817
05:09:07,990 --> 05:09:32,360
Really mean thing to say to somebody eat that I what does this mean? What's my favorite color? Uh blue?

1818
05:09:33,409 --> 05:09:35,409
Or green or teal?

1819
05:09:37,349 --> 05:09:40,389
My favorite color is the green stripe of the aqua fresh toothpaste

1820
05:09:41,599 --> 05:09:43,919
Not a lie. I truly that's what I truly want

1821
05:09:44,560 --> 05:10:14,610
God damn it

1822
05:10:14,610 --> 05:10:17,330
No, I

1823
05:10:17,330 --> 05:10:28,040
I don't this is not working. That's not the first fountain. This whole place is coming down

1824
05:10:29,080 --> 05:10:31,080
You have to have to do the first one first

1825
05:10:40,439 --> 05:10:43,159
Where's the first fountain?

1826
05:10:43,159 --> 05:10:45,400
I don't I don't remember even passing one. Is it on here?

1827
05:10:49,959 --> 05:10:57,319
Same as the door puzzle. You have to shoot plorts into the mouse. Okay, he's ignoring the chat. No, no

1828
05:10:57,799 --> 05:11:01,119
So I have to do arrow earlier in the level. Okay

1829
05:11:06,310 --> 05:11:08,229
Well, i'm probably getting close to calling it

1830
05:11:08,680 --> 05:11:10,279
I'm getting close to calling it

1831
05:11:10,279 --> 05:11:14,630
I'll do this part here and then we'll probably call the stream

1832
05:11:15,189 --> 05:11:20,849
I've had a lot of fun. I've had a lot of fun with you today

1833
05:11:25,040 --> 05:11:30,130
Get out of here rock plorts in the fountain

1834
05:11:33,650 --> 05:11:44,319
We'll go slime lamp. What's the verdict on next slime rancher stream?

1835
05:11:49,159 --> 05:11:55,680
I don't think so. I think that's it the stream content of slime rancher

1836
05:11:57,830 --> 05:11:59,330
probably

1837
05:11:59,330 --> 05:12:03,159
probably going to

1838
05:12:03,159 --> 05:12:09,490
Oh, no, if i'm gonna play I will probably just grind and play on my own if I feel like it

1839
05:12:10,689 --> 05:12:15,810
Just have my mouth open

1840
05:12:15,810 --> 05:12:19,939
Maybe after all this time. He hates it. No, I just

1841
05:12:20,740 --> 05:12:23,060
I I think i'm pretty much almost at the end game

1842
05:12:25,060 --> 05:12:27,060
I'm going farther away

1843
05:12:32,389 --> 05:12:34,880
Wait, I want rocks

1844
05:12:35,750 --> 05:12:41,990
Can you guys give me rocks? No

1845
05:12:41,990 --> 05:12:43,909
You have a plort too

1846
05:12:43,909 --> 05:12:48,419
You're not even that close to the end game. Well, well

1847
05:12:49,220 --> 05:12:52,560
Maybe one day i'll get there

1848
05:12:52,560 --> 05:12:54,479
Uh, so what you can expect in the next

1849
05:12:55,119 --> 05:12:57,830
three or four days

1850
05:12:57,830 --> 05:13:00,310
I'm going to try to get I haven't done it yet

1851
05:13:01,360 --> 05:13:04,240
I have to sign up and do some stuff with the gta rp server

1852
05:13:05,110 --> 05:13:08,069
So i'm gonna like go through that process over the next few days

1853
05:13:09,139 --> 05:13:11,540
And see what happens

1854
05:13:11,540 --> 05:13:18,259
I am not guaranteeing that i'm gonna be playing gta rp. I don't know. I think there's like a system where you have to get

1855
05:13:18,900 --> 05:13:25,139
Uh broad you have to get like approved and white listed and everything I think or something or other I don't really know

1856
05:13:26,450 --> 05:13:34,099
Uh gta rp. Yeah, we'll see. I once I if I get in maybe we'll do a few streams of

1857
05:13:35,009 --> 05:13:50,799
You just fucking around an rp. That's on tap potentially besides that

1858
05:13:51,360 --> 05:13:57,009
There are a lot of random games that I still have to play. I still want to play

1859
05:13:57,009 --> 05:13:59,009
I still have a thousand year door by the way

1860
05:14:00,680 --> 05:14:10,000
Maybe if gta rp doesn't work out next week start thousand year door, maybe if gta rp doesn't work out in the next week

1861
05:14:11,279 --> 05:14:12,799
I'll play

1862
05:14:12,799 --> 05:14:25,270
I don't know figure it out. I got a handful of games that I have installed that I want to do

1863
05:14:25,349 --> 05:14:43,430
All right. I am very lost this way. There's one at the beginning of the level. I'm curious about this

1864
05:14:43,430 --> 05:14:45,270
Where is the one at the beginning of the level?

1865
05:14:45,270 --> 05:14:55,360
Rock fountain is this guy too?

1866
05:15:03,520 --> 05:15:05,279
Rock fountain

1867
05:15:05,279 --> 05:15:10,150
You gotta say a rock. Oh

05:15:10,790 --> 05:15:31,439

Chickens chickens chickens chickens. There you are

Okay, get the water

1900

I did get mosaic. That's pretty probably pretty rare

1907
05:20:05,209 --> 05:20:08,919
I didn't I didn't even know what that thing did

1908
05:20:08,919 --> 05:20:10,599
I've never fed that before

1909
05:20:10,599 --> 05:20:15,080
I fed him once and he exploded

1910
05:20:15,860 --> 05:20:17,880
That's really cool though. I like that

1911
05:20:17,880 --> 05:20:19,880
All right. I want to go come I want to do mosaic stuff

05:20:24,569 --> 05:20:26,090
Let's use

1914
05:20:26,090 --> 05:20:27,659
Let's just run

1915
05:20:27,659 --> 05:20:33,720
I want to do mosaic crystal

1916
05:20:34,360 --> 05:20:51,939
What do mosaics eat? He sounds like he wants to do another stream of this

1917
05:20:53,770 --> 05:20:59,270
Um, ah, you know, there's probably enough there to do it but

1918
05:21:00,090 --> 05:21:01,849
You know, i'm

1919
05:21:01,849 --> 05:21:06,090
If I don't play another if I don't play a game for a week, you'll never see it again

1920
05:21:07,290 --> 05:21:09,180
All right

1921
05:21:09,180 --> 05:21:11,180
Just the way it is. That's the way it's always been

1922
05:21:11,340 --> 05:21:15,500
So if I get into gta rp

1923
05:21:16,060 --> 05:21:20,650
next week

1924
05:21:20,650 --> 05:21:22,650
I'm I just i'm not going to play this

1925
05:21:23,299 --> 05:21:26,090
And then that'll be one week

1926
05:21:26,090 --> 05:21:28,090
And then it just it's gone in my mind completely

1927
05:21:28,490 --> 05:21:40,759
What about yakuza? Oh, yeah, I do have to play yakuza because they won the in the rumble

1928
05:21:41,240 --> 05:21:54,150
That's true. All right teleport back. Let's check out these slimes and then they we're gonna call it there

1929
05:21:54,869 --> 05:22:05,819
You said it was gonna you said it was gonna happen in like june or july. I did

1930
05:22:08,650 --> 05:22:12,409
That's so long. That is so long from now. That's not even funny

1931
05:22:14,150 --> 05:22:15,750
All right. Here we go

1932
05:22:15,750 --> 05:22:17,590

1933
05:22:17,590 --> 05:22:19,430
I'm gonna put you in here

1934

What do you like veggies? Ooh, they're so pretty

1935
05:22:22,869 --> 05:22:26,569
Okay, let's feed a veggie and let's start the process here. I'm curious

1936
05:22:27,450 --> 05:22:34,020
What's your favorite veggie though? It's important

1937
05:22:40,759 --> 05:22:42,759
Silver parsnip. Well, I don't have any of those

1938
05:22:43,400 --> 05:22:56,439
Okay, let's do slime wind

1939
05:22:58,860 --> 05:23:02,060
Well, it doesn't matter what his favorite food is because I he's gonna be combined with um

1940
05:23:08,169 --> 05:23:09,939
Why are they angry?

1941
05:23:09,939 --> 05:23:11,939
Oh fuck. There's no food left

1942
05:23:12,180 --> 05:23:14,180
Uh

1943
05:23:16,740 --> 05:23:28,549

05:23:29,270 --> 05:23:49,860
No, no, come here my babies my babies my babies my babies my babies my babies

1947
05:24:01,049 --> 05:24:04,490
Where are my bees? What the fuck are the bees doing? What are you doing?

1948
05:24:05,450 --> 05:24:09,430
Get up

1949
05:24:09,430 --> 05:24:12,009
I'm mad about that. Absolutely

1950
05:24:13,819 --> 05:24:20,229

Why?

1954
05:24:29,779 --> 05:24:35,500
What do you get 50 community subs like two hours ago? What the fuck? I missed that

1955
05:24:36,060 --> 05:24:38,779
Well, that's an insane amount of money. Holy shit

1956
05:24:40,409 --> 05:24:45,619
Vin smoke if you're still here, that's 50 community subs. Oh, that's a ton of people

1957
05:24:50,279 --> 05:24:52,459

Let's make some slimes

1960
05:25:06,139 --> 05:25:13,540
You guys all right?

1961
05:25:13,540 --> 05:25:15,479
And do it

1962
05:25:15,479 --> 05:25:18,680
Wow, really cool. Really really cool. Really cool. Really cool

1963
05:25:19,319 --> 05:25:21,500
Really cool actually

1964
05:25:21,500 --> 05:25:38,569
very cool

1965
05:25:38,569 --> 05:25:44,520
Give those to me

1966
05:25:44,520 --> 05:25:45,959
Here it comes

1967
05:25:45,959 --> 05:25:47,979
We're gonna turn them all

1968
05:25:47,979 --> 05:25:56,310
We exploded

1969
05:25:56,310 --> 05:25:59,029
Who's fucking raining hell down here? What's going on?

1970
05:25:59,750 --> 05:26:08,939
What are you doing over here?

1971
05:26:08,939 --> 05:26:11,689
How did you get all the way over here?

1972
05:26:12,229 --> 05:26:14,229
They attract other slimes

1973
05:26:23,619 --> 05:26:25,700
Sparkles make fire. Does that hurt them?

1974
05:26:34,169 --> 05:26:51,770
It really are so pretty

1975
05:27:05,619 --> 05:27:07,619
Solar roof solar roof solar roof

1976
05:27:16,169 --> 05:27:18,020
Whoa

1977
05:27:18,020 --> 05:27:20,020
That looks really cool. All right, I gotta sell

1978
05:27:20,180 --> 05:27:33,959
Why are they so angry?

1979
05:27:33,959 --> 05:27:36,439
Why are they so angry? What's going on? Why so angry?

1980
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:41,799
Get over here you fucking little weirdo you weirdos. What's going on? Why are you so hungry?

1981
05:27:42,439 --> 05:27:44,439
Why are they so hungry any fruit?

1982
05:27:50,099 --> 05:27:52,099
Oh fuck. I don't have any fruit

1983
05:27:55,130 --> 05:27:57,630
Uh, it's fruit this way

1984
05:28:21,020 --> 05:28:23,439
This is my last fucking failed experiment

1985
05:28:24,540 --> 05:28:26,220
I gotta go hurry

1986
05:28:26,220 --> 05:28:27,900
Hurry hurry hurry

1987
05:28:27,900 --> 05:28:31,900
I come back to the planet every once in a while to get the groceries and I leave

1988
05:28:43,080 --> 05:28:44,040
ow

1989
05:28:44,040 --> 05:28:50,299
Whatever. I i'll see i'm done

1990
05:28:50,939 --> 05:28:53,580
That's game over. I'm just gonna sell some of these because i'm gonna see how cool it looks

1991
05:28:57,000 --> 05:29:01,560
It's over for the fire guys. I'm sorry. I they're so cute, but I well, no, he's okay

1992
05:29:02,279 --> 05:29:04,279
He's okay. He's okay. He's okay

1993
05:29:04,279 --> 05:29:05,479
Pick him up

1994
05:29:05,479 --> 05:29:07,799
Pick him up. Let him in. Oh my god. He's okay

1995
05:29:17,259 --> 05:29:19,580
Get inside of here

1996
05:29:20,810 --> 05:29:22,810
Why does this have to be so difficult?

1997
05:29:22,970 --> 05:29:27,369
It just is like I why is this so hard to make them stay in here?

1998
05:29:29,319 --> 05:29:30,919
You guys settling down

1999
05:29:30,919 --> 05:29:39,240
This thing is very intimidating

2000
05:29:56,259 --> 05:29:58,259
Wow, they're like prismatic

2001
05:30:03,400 --> 05:30:04,439
Cool

2002
05:30:04,439 --> 05:30:06,439
All right. What do they sell for? Let's get some money

2003
05:30:09,080 --> 05:30:11,080
Yeah, just for fun just for fun

2004
05:30:11,799 --> 05:30:14,490
Let's do let's make like mosaic cat

2005
05:30:15,049 --> 05:30:17,049
Why not? I'm done

2006
05:30:17,529 --> 05:30:21,020
This game is really fun. Well, i'm going to make mosaic cat for fun

2007
05:30:21,659 --> 05:30:36,020
Or mosaic rock

2008
05:30:36,020 --> 05:30:38,650
a guitar farm

2009
05:30:38,650 --> 05:30:41,450
Uh, it's I think that's too involved. I'm stream's gonna be over here in a minute

2010
05:30:42,250 --> 05:30:48,950
Okay, let's make a mosaic cat

2011
05:30:51,240 --> 05:30:55,830
Cool

2012
05:30:55,830 --> 05:31:13,639
Thanks for the kiss

2013
05:31:13,639 --> 05:31:17,299
cool

2014
05:31:17,299 --> 05:31:19,299
All right. Now these are mine sell

2015
05:31:26,680 --> 05:31:29,959
It's just kind of hell of that looks really cool. They'll go sparkles

2016
05:31:31,000 --> 05:31:34,650
Very sparkly

2017
05:31:34,650 --> 05:31:39,080
I love it. Very very cool. Let's sell these and then i'm going to

2018
05:31:40,040 --> 05:31:41,880
I'm gonna call it here

2019
05:31:41,880 --> 05:31:43,880
70 80 bucks each nice

2020
05:31:54,819 --> 05:31:59,540
Free the whole ranch. Uh, no. No, I because if I play off stream for any reason

2021
05:32:00,340 --> 05:32:05,080
I don't want to destroy the save file. I mean obviously put

2022
05:32:05,720 --> 05:32:11,860
Like what like 17 18 hours into the game so far. I don't think I want to just delete it

2023
05:32:12,580 --> 05:32:16,360
That was really cool. Very very good

2024
05:32:17,080 --> 05:32:20,840
This game i'm gonna give a rating. Here you go. Everyone wants me to rate games. Sure

2025
05:32:21,479 --> 05:32:32,729
This game is a

2026
05:32:32,810 --> 05:32:38,569
Hmm that's way higher than a seven

2027
05:32:41,509 --> 05:32:55,139
um

2028
05:32:55,139 --> 05:33:00,869
Much higher than 7.5. I don't think this I don't know. I'm not sure this is quite

2029
05:33:01,430 --> 05:33:03,750
I'm not sure this is quite 9.0 territory

2030
05:33:05,770 --> 05:33:07,130
might be

2031
05:33:07,130 --> 05:33:11,529
Hmm

2032
05:33:11,529 --> 05:33:22,150
It might be

2033
05:33:22,150 --> 05:33:27,900
8.7

2034
05:33:29,099 --> 05:33:34,599
This is an 8.7

2035
05:33:34,599 --> 05:33:36,599
Very very very very it's very very good

2036
05:33:40,919 --> 05:33:43,159
I would say this is probably one of the best games that came out in 2015

2037
05:33:58,119 --> 05:34:00,419
elaborate on that

2038
05:34:00,419 --> 05:34:03,139
How much more do you want me to elaborate that's not when it came out

2039
05:34:04,610 --> 05:34:06,610
B plus best game of 2015

2040
05:34:07,250 --> 05:34:09,250
What else came out in 2015 that you liked?

2041
05:34:13,990 --> 05:34:19,319
This is an 8.7. What have you rated 10 out of 10? Just curious

2042
05:34:22,770 --> 05:34:24,229
And then

2043
05:34:24,229 --> 05:34:26,389
Bloodborne's like a 9.7 for me 9.8

2044
05:34:27,029 --> 05:34:31,779
I mean, no 9. Yeah 9.7 because the points where he's taken off for that stupid ass swamp level

2045
05:34:39,349 --> 05:34:41,189
Undertale is 2015

2046
05:34:41,189 --> 05:34:45,459
Sounds like a pretty good year

2047
05:34:45,459 --> 05:34:50,450
I thought it was your favorite game. How is it not a 10?

2048
05:34:53,080 --> 05:34:55,959
well because

2049
05:34:57,880 --> 05:34:59,880
10 just seems too easy to give something

2050
05:35:01,159 --> 05:35:05,000
Nothing is perfect

2051
05:35:05,000 --> 05:35:11,650
Nothing is perfect

2052
05:35:11,650 --> 05:35:14,529
I have not come across a game that I thought was

2053
05:35:15,169 --> 05:35:16,209
Perfect

2054
05:35:16,209 --> 05:35:20,290
That has not happened yet

2055
05:35:20,290 --> 05:35:22,290
Well, hold on. Hold on

2056
05:35:23,669 --> 05:35:25,669
Team fortress 2 might

2057
05:35:26,930 --> 05:35:30,400
Might be close to perfect

2058
05:35:30,400 --> 05:35:32,400
Well, wait, hold on tf2

2059
05:35:33,119 --> 05:35:36,319
tf2 like circa

2060
05:35:36,860 --> 05:35:39,419
2014 like 2013

2061
05:35:39,419 --> 05:35:43,330
tf2 2013

2062
05:35:43,409 --> 05:35:45,409
It could be close to a perfect video game

2063
05:35:50,540 --> 05:35:54,459
If I would have to give tf2 a 9.9. I don't I mean

2064
05:35:55,790 --> 05:35:58,909
that seems so stupid to say that but it's

2065
05:35:59,630 --> 05:36:01,549
Probably a 9.9

2066
05:36:01,549 --> 05:36:05,900
And i'm trying to think of the reasons of why

2067
05:36:07,970 --> 05:36:09,490
and I think

2068
05:36:09,490 --> 05:36:11,970
for the most part

2069
05:36:11,970 --> 05:36:14,479
It was based around

2070
05:36:14,479 --> 05:36:15,439
Oh

2071
05:36:15,439 --> 05:36:30,270
Like some of the little things that irritated you about tf2. He gave spore an 8.7. Did no I didn't

2072
05:36:30,830 --> 05:36:34,159
Spore's an 8.5

2073
05:36:34,159 --> 05:36:35,599
Sorry underneath this

2074
05:36:35,599 --> 05:36:43,900
You think sacrificing tf2 for alex was a fair trade-off. I don't think they sacrificed tf2 for alex

2075
05:36:43,900 --> 05:36:48,380
They stopped really caring about tf2 more way before alex was a thing

2076
05:36:49,020 --> 05:36:57,970
Spore is like a 7

2077
05:36:57,970 --> 05:37:03,150
No, I didn't give spore a 3.5. I gave the civilization phase a 3.5

2078
05:37:03,709 --> 05:37:06,180
I gave the creature creator a 9

2079
05:37:06,180 --> 05:37:08,860
I gave the space like a 8

2080
05:37:08,860 --> 05:37:24,060
Or like a 7 and then I gave the tribal stage like a 7 spores a 9.8. Eh, I don't know about that

2081
05:37:25,119 --> 05:37:27,119
Space is an 8. No space is like a 4

2082
05:37:28,560 --> 05:37:38,270
That adds up to more than 10. Well, no, I'm rating the different portions of the game as 0 out of 10

2083
05:37:39,090 --> 05:37:41,250
I do that shit

2084
05:37:41,250 --> 05:37:43,569
Don't that's how we do this on this stream

2085
05:37:44,209 --> 05:37:47,250
Remember resident evil 7

2086
05:37:47,250 --> 05:37:51,169
The first I based it on time and and portions of games

2087
05:37:52,180 --> 05:37:54,180
different areas different acts

2088
05:37:55,099 --> 05:37:59,580
Well, what what act are we in and how shitty was this? Resident evil 7's first act

2089
05:38:00,139 --> 05:38:02,139
Was a 9.4 out of 10

2090
05:38:02,639 --> 05:38:03,919
resident evil's

2091
05:38:03,919 --> 05:38:05,599
second act was like a

2092
05:38:05,599 --> 05:38:08,319
Seven and resident evil's third act was like a two

2093
05:38:09,119 --> 05:38:19,619
Resident evil seven's third act is a literal fucking almost one out of ten. The first act is a fucking 9.4 9.5

2094
05:38:21,340 --> 05:38:26,860
So, I mean overall you think about okay, how how much and how are you weighting the third act?

2095
05:38:27,599 --> 05:38:32,819
What what what's the weight of the third act? What percentages is that is that weight?

2096
05:38:35,409 --> 05:38:37,409
The guy ended up giving resident evil 7 like a

2097
05:38:37,569 --> 05:38:44,029
I mean eight two or something

2098
05:38:44,029 --> 05:38:49,229
How good is the forest versus indigo quarry versus desert versus ancient ruins? Okay now here you here's the problem

2099
05:38:50,369 --> 05:38:53,889
Ancient ruins you heard me flip out a little bit. I thought that was a fucking four out of ten

2100
05:38:55,040 --> 05:38:56,639
I don't like that place

2101
05:38:56,639 --> 05:39:00,540
These are the first these first two areas

2102
05:39:01,400 --> 05:39:03,220
9.7

2103
05:39:03,220 --> 05:39:05,310
8.6

2104
05:39:05,310 --> 05:39:07,310
then that third area with the um

2105
05:39:08,459 --> 05:39:11,259
With the caves and the crystals in the cave system. That's like an that's like a

2106
05:39:12,139 --> 05:39:16,189
Look at 8.4. So I wait

2107
05:39:16,909 --> 05:39:24,720
That ancient ruins part like that's like that's like 10 weight. That's not like a full like 20 30 weight. Absolutely not

2108
05:39:25,119 --> 05:39:33,090
I could overlook it. It's all right. I I just I I wasn't a big fan of the ancient ruins place

2109
05:39:33,169 --> 05:39:41,169
I like the place after that the crystal place the part where you're on the boat in resident evil seven

2110
05:39:41,490 --> 05:39:44,880
I thought was just stupid

2111
05:39:45,700 --> 05:39:58,799
And I waited it kind of high because it was to kind of ruin the game for me. What would you give stardew?

2112
05:39:59,279 --> 05:40:00,959
It's at least a nine

2113
05:40:00,959 --> 05:40:02,580
stardew is probably like a

2114
05:40:02,659 --> 05:40:05,090
uh

2115
05:40:05,090 --> 05:40:07,090
Stardew's uh, hey

2116
05:40:07,169 --> 05:40:09,409
That's pretty that's close

2117
05:40:09,409 --> 05:40:11,970
Stardew's really close to being perfect as well. It is

2118
05:40:15,889 --> 05:40:18,369
Is it weird of me to say? Oh, no, that's so unfair

2119
05:40:21,040 --> 05:40:25,259
That's very close. It's probably like a nine eight

2120
05:40:25,500 --> 05:40:27,979
Star oh man stardew valley might be perfect

2121
05:40:38,830 --> 05:40:41,069
What was wrong with stardew valley that I didn't like

2122
05:40:45,150 --> 05:40:47,630
I don't know if I can think of anything that might be a perfect video game

2123
05:40:48,270 --> 05:40:54,349
But a stardew valley better than bloodborne

2124
05:40:55,439 --> 05:40:57,200
oh

2125
05:40:57,200 --> 05:41:01,490
Shit bloodborne is at 30 fps ps4 exclusive

2126
05:41:03,439 --> 05:41:05,680
has some technical problems

2127
05:41:05,680 --> 05:41:09,459
ran like shit in some areas and

2128
05:41:10,979 --> 05:41:14,180
There's one area of there's one or two areas in bloodborne that I wasn't a huge fan of

2129
05:41:15,740 --> 05:41:17,979
Stardew valley is oh, oh man

2130
05:41:18,700 --> 05:41:24,130
I don't know star. I started valley might be a 10

2131
05:41:25,330 --> 05:41:26,610
It could be

2132
05:41:26,610 --> 05:41:30,900
I don't know if i'm willing to give it that score though

2133
05:41:36,240 --> 05:41:39,599
Combat's not good in stardew. Yeah, but it's like that's like extra stuff

2134
05:41:41,599 --> 05:41:43,599
Yeah

2135
05:41:43,599 --> 05:41:47,759
There's such different games. I know they are start of no stardew valley is a 9.8

2136
05:41:48,479 --> 05:41:52,560
It's a 9 8

2137
05:41:52,560 --> 05:41:56,080
tf 2 is a 9.9 stardew valley is a 9.8 bloodborne is a 9.7

2138
05:41:56,639 --> 05:41:59,979
There you go

2139
05:41:59,979 --> 05:42:06,560
On diablo 2 9.9. That's not a game's like at its very core. That game is like a 7.4

2140
05:42:13,500 --> 05:42:15,680
but

2141
05:42:15,680 --> 05:42:17,759
The fun factor of diablo 2

2142
05:42:19,360 --> 05:42:25,069
Is like a 50 the fun factor of diablo 2

2143
05:42:25,790 --> 05:42:27,950
Way higher than a 7.4 is at least it's a 10

2144
05:42:28,509 --> 05:42:31,759
One of the most fun I've ever had playing a video game was diablo 2

2145
05:42:35,650 --> 05:42:36,849
What hades?

2146
05:42:36,849 --> 05:42:40,979
hades is a

2147
05:42:40,979 --> 05:42:45,580
Hades is like a 9.2. That's a 9.2. I don't know if I'd call it perfect

2148
05:42:46,139 --> 05:42:48,959
It's like probably 9.2 9.3

2149
05:42:49,599 --> 05:42:53,279
That's too high. I don't think it is. No, I don't think it is 9.2 is pretty high, but it is

2150
05:42:54,000 --> 05:42:56,240
You gave saw an 8.9. No, I I gave

2151
05:42:56,799 --> 05:42:58,799
Uh outer wilds at 8.9

2152
05:43:00,659 --> 05:43:02,659
And half of you wanted to kill me

2153
05:43:08,700 --> 05:43:13,740
You guys want me to give you my scores for video games, but if I don't do a high enough score for your favorite video game

2154
05:43:15,139 --> 05:43:17,380
I you want me to like drink poison

2155
05:43:17,939 --> 05:43:29,319
This dude's an 8.8. Eugene 8.7. Andy. I don't give everything an 8.7 or an 8.8

2156
05:43:30,099 --> 05:43:38,419
I just told you three games right there that were a 9 9 9 8 and 9 7

2157
05:43:40,750 --> 05:43:44,209
7.8. Andy. I what what other games have I given a 7.8?

2158
05:43:44,849 --> 05:43:51,810
sniper elite 3

2159
05:43:51,810 --> 05:43:54,689
Um, but maybe like a 5.5

2160
05:44:01,819 --> 05:44:05,819
Didn't I play that game for like two or three hours and I just said this game's not fun. I stopped

2161
05:44:09,599 --> 05:44:12,240
What? Rate the world of warcraft expansions

2162
05:44:13,729 --> 05:44:18,770
wrath of the lich king is is okay. Well, this is just in the universe of world of warcraft. This is not

2163
05:44:19,490 --> 05:44:22,849
In like the actual universe of all video games that I've ever played. This is just

2164
05:44:23,650 --> 05:44:28,610
Bracket put in brackets world of warcraft corralled in one spot wrath of the lich king is a 10

2165
05:44:30,209 --> 05:44:32,209
burning crusade is a 9.7

2166
05:44:35,389 --> 05:44:37,389
legion is a 9.5

2167
05:44:40,180 --> 05:44:59,659
And then everything else is a zero. That's it. It wasn't saying you loved the latest expansion

2168
05:45:01,970 --> 05:45:03,970
Well, actually, hold on. Hold on

2169
05:45:03,970 --> 05:45:08,209
Miss I miss a pandaria. Okay. Hold on miss a pandaria was like a six

2170
05:45:09,150 --> 05:45:11,459
Everything else is zero

2171
05:45:11,459 --> 05:45:13,860
I didn't I I played miss pandaria was okay

2172
05:45:14,500 --> 05:45:24,779
I'm just like still going here. I'm not even like playing the game. Just talking

2173
05:45:25,340 --> 05:45:30,319
Let's get to the end here. We can still talk but let's do the credits

2174
05:45:33,700 --> 05:45:36,180
You're just meandering around the ranch. I know

2175
05:45:37,380 --> 05:45:39,619
Uh, but yeah, we can keep talking while we see the credits

2176
05:45:40,259 --> 05:45:43,819
Thanks for the subs. Thanks for watching. Sorry. I missed a bunch of them

2177
05:45:44,060 --> 05:45:48,860
It was a huge 50 community sub drop that I just was I must have been screaming at the tv

2178
05:45:49,340 --> 05:45:59,729
What about jedi academy? Um comedy factor was like a 10

2179
05:46:00,369 --> 05:46:02,369
Video game factor was like a 7.4

2180
05:46:03,580 --> 05:46:16,139
Maybe even lower like a 6.8. What would you rate fistful of frags?

2181
05:46:17,540 --> 05:46:22,900
A solid 8.0 and I know that's a joke of a score, but it just is that's that's a fact

2182
05:46:23,459 --> 05:46:30,750
Now that's an 8.5. It is

2183
05:46:30,830 --> 05:46:32,669
I had so much fun playing that game

2184
05:46:32,669 --> 05:46:37,950
You know how desperately I wanted someone to make a fistful of frags into a full non-mod video game

2185
05:46:39,889 --> 05:46:44,369
Where it was just it was just a full triple a video game of that caliber

2186
05:46:45,250 --> 05:46:55,569
Uh too bad. I would love it red dead redemption 2. No, but red red red dead redemption 2 was not

2187
05:46:56,430 --> 05:46:57,930
an fps

2188
05:46:57,930 --> 05:47:12,060
Multiplayer shooter it would have been really good. I know rate day's gone and jump king day's gone is a four

2189
05:47:12,700 --> 05:47:19,619
jump king is a

2190
05:47:19,619 --> 05:47:29,200
7.9. What would you rate the last whopper? Uh, probably a five or six

2191
05:47:29,919 --> 05:47:35,549
Portal two stop ignoring me

2192
05:47:36,700 --> 05:47:39,819
Portal two when it came out I think was like a nine four

2193
05:47:40,380 --> 05:47:46,099
But portal two kind of five ten years later. I kind of almost looked back and it may have been too high

2194
05:47:56,060 --> 05:47:59,419
Maybe like if I were to go back and think about it without the like holy shit

2195
05:47:59,419 --> 05:48:04,930
This is the greatest thing i've ever played it my entire life. I feel like i've portals. Yeah, maybe like

2196
05:48:05,090 --> 05:48:06,860
Um

2197
05:48:06,860 --> 05:48:11,419
I haven't played it in a long time. I would probably say probably like a nine two nine three

2198
05:48:12,000 --> 05:48:15,119
I think it should be docked like point one or point two points

2199
05:48:16,770 --> 05:48:22,459
I had just I had just I was so excited for it that I was just clouded my face clouded my face

2200
05:48:23,740 --> 05:48:39,229
I gave it like a nine point five. It's probably like a nine points free. What about tetris?

2201
05:48:40,240 --> 05:48:51,229
I know the reason why I can't rate the portal games like tens like everybody else does because those games made me sick

2202
05:48:52,380 --> 05:48:57,700
I powered through playing portal one and portal two and it's like this is the this is so much

2203
05:48:58,259 --> 05:49:01,779
This is the funniest thing i've ever done. I love this game. It's so good

2204
05:49:04,099 --> 05:49:08,349
I had to lie down every couple of hours. I couldn't play that game for more than an hour or two

2205
05:49:08,430 --> 05:49:10,750
I had to go actually physically lie down or throw up at my desk

2206
05:49:12,830 --> 05:49:16,110
So I can't give it a ten. It made me almost throw up five times

2207
05:49:16,669 --> 05:49:29,090
So it's a nine point two

2208
05:49:29,090 --> 05:49:33,950
How do you play vr? Well vr is a lot different. You have a full

2209
05:49:34,509 --> 05:49:37,470
You have a full essentially a hundred eighty three sixty degrees of vision

2210
05:49:38,860 --> 05:49:39,819
it's the

2211
05:49:39,819 --> 05:49:45,180
Looking through the portals and moving around through the portals and jumping through them and doing the speed thing where you run

2212
05:49:46,139 --> 05:49:47,979
And then through another one

2213
05:49:47,979 --> 05:49:51,580
The world kind of turns sometimes in portal is here's the worst part about it

2214
05:49:51,900 --> 05:49:53,900
Sometimes in portal when you go through a portal

2215
05:49:54,380 --> 05:50:00,220
And your camera flips upside down right side up because you went through backwards or something and it's like you flip forward

2216
05:50:01,099 --> 05:50:17,220
That would kill me every time motion sick ridiculously easy

2217
05:50:17,220 --> 05:50:20,659
I wouldn't say ridiculously easy, but like enough where I it can be an issue

2218
05:50:22,659 --> 05:50:25,729
Sorry, what about noita?

2219
05:50:27,840 --> 05:50:29,840
Noita was not really my kind of game

2220
05:50:30,639 --> 05:50:34,080
I would say terraria was not my kind of game either and I put them in the same category

2221
05:50:35,950 --> 05:50:40,990
I love what terraria does and I like that terraria is cool and I think it's a really fun experience

2222
05:50:41,470 --> 05:50:43,470
But I don't know if I would rate terraria that high

2223
05:50:44,029 --> 05:50:46,029
It would probably be pretty low for me

2224
05:50:46,029 --> 05:50:53,150
They're not the same. Well, they're they're like this they're played very similarly. They're not the same exact game

2225
05:51:01,650 --> 05:51:05,330
I think they're really cool. They're just kind of not the type of game that I like to play

2226
05:51:05,810 --> 05:51:13,619
What about super mario bros 3?

2227
05:51:17,040 --> 05:51:20,319
Wait, there's a game ratings wiki page of mine

2228
05:51:21,869 --> 05:51:23,330
What?

2229
05:51:23,330 --> 05:51:25,330
No, there's not hold on a second

2230
05:51:28,419 --> 05:51:30,419
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

2231
05:51:31,680 --> 05:51:33,680
Why is among us up here as a 10?

2232
05:51:34,939 --> 05:51:38,299
That's somebody edited somebody's doing bullshit editing here

2233
05:51:45,619 --> 05:51:51,020
That shouldn't be up there. What why is a whopper on here? A whopper is not a game

2234
05:51:57,119 --> 05:52:01,360
What an art of wilds is is not even right either. Wait, didn't I i've read

2235
05:52:01,520 --> 05:52:13,979
I retroactively went back and gave art of wilds a 9.1 because I cracked under the pressure andy right it was it was an 8.9

2236
05:52:18,959 --> 05:52:27,040
Binding of isaac binding of isaac is is a 9 binding by isaac is a 9.0. Get that off among us a fucking 10

2237
05:52:28,000 --> 05:52:29,360
No

2238
05:52:29,360 --> 05:52:34,000
Even if I played among us, I probably wouldn't think it was that good of a game even if I played it

2239
05:52:35,340 --> 05:52:36,779
Not a 10

2240
05:52:36,779 --> 05:52:41,950
If I even if I if I was a big fan of among us, i'm not I wouldn't give it a 10. It would be

2241
05:52:42,909 --> 05:52:43,869
I don't know

2242
05:52:43,869 --> 05:52:45,950
I don't know. I haven't played it so I can't give you a rating

2243
05:52:47,409 --> 05:52:57,709
Refresh I just where is it?

2244
05:53:00,740 --> 05:53:02,740
Somebody linked to me again. I don't know. I can't get back to it

2245
05:53:03,060 --> 05:53:08,610
Stop ignoring hollow night. Um hollow night's probably like a

2246
05:53:09,169 --> 05:53:11,169
I can't give it a full. I didn't finish it

2247
05:53:11,250 --> 05:53:13,250
I feel like I would need to that's the kind of game that you need to finish

2248
05:53:13,889 --> 05:53:15,650
Before you give it a real rating

2249
05:53:15,650 --> 05:53:22,880
Binding of isaac 9.0 bugsnack 7.95. Why 9.5?

2250
05:53:23,680 --> 05:53:31,630
Germa won't write black and white 2 feels bad man. Hi germa lots of love from the navy. Well, thanks

2251
05:53:32,509 --> 05:53:34,509
black and white 2 um

2252
05:53:35,580 --> 05:53:40,380
Which one was better black and white 1 was better than black and white 2, wasn't it? I forget flip it around maybe

2253
05:53:41,180 --> 05:53:46,270
Black and white 2 was an 83

2254
05:53:46,270 --> 05:53:50,509
Black and white 1 was like an 86 flip it somewhere around if I forget which one was better

2255
05:54:05,709 --> 05:54:13,119
Asthma phobia 7 7.1. No, it's 7.0 dark souls 3

2256
05:54:20,610 --> 05:54:25,650
Dead rising. Yeah, okay dead risings dead risings probably like us

2257
05:54:26,619 --> 05:54:27,740
uh

2258
05:54:27,740 --> 05:54:31,709
Dead risings probably an 82

2259
05:54:35,490 --> 05:54:41,009
No, it's not it's higher than that. It's an 86 85 dead rising is an 85 dead rising 2 is an 85

2260
05:54:41,169 --> 05:54:43,169
I don't know. I don't rate video games

2261
05:54:43,650 --> 05:54:47,889
I just play them and think they're fun sometimes or I think they suck or I don't like them. I don't know

2262
05:54:48,049 --> 05:54:50,049
I can't rate video games

2263
05:54:51,389 --> 05:54:54,590
Sekiro, oh i'm gonna piss a lot of people off with Sekiro

2264
05:54:55,229 --> 05:54:59,150
Sekiro is the worst souls kind of like video game. It's the worst one

2265
05:55:00,299 --> 05:55:02,619
I think I gave it like a nine. I was lying

2266
05:55:04,340 --> 05:55:06,340
I gave it a nine. I was a liar

2267
05:55:07,139 --> 05:55:11,139
I was like, oh, you know, it's like a 9.0. I think after I finished it. I said that

2268
05:55:11,779 --> 05:55:14,189
I think that might be the worst one

2269
05:55:14,189 --> 05:55:18,509
No, dark souls 2 is way worse. Never mind. Okay. Well, I need to how many games have they made?

2270
05:55:23,330 --> 05:55:31,700
From software hold on

2271
05:55:31,700 --> 05:55:37,889
Okay. Yeah dark dark souls 2 is worse than uh, okay. Here we go. Dark souls 2 is worse than Sekiro

2272
05:55:38,529 --> 05:55:42,369
Dark souls 2 is like a 6.5

2273
05:55:43,759 --> 05:55:45,759
Sekiro is like a 7.6

2274
05:55:50,270 --> 05:55:52,259
dark souls

2275
05:55:52,259 --> 05:55:53,779
three

2276
05:55:53,779 --> 05:55:55,619
Is like an s

2277
05:55:55,619 --> 05:55:57,619
like an eight point

2278
05:55:58,020 --> 05:56:00,659
No, it's not. It's a eight point. It's an 8.1

2279
05:56:02,340 --> 05:56:04,340
Dark souls 1 is an 8.5

2280
05:56:04,979 --> 05:56:06,979
No, it's not. It's higher than that 8.8

2281
05:56:08,380 --> 05:56:11,580
Bloodborne is a 9.7. I don't do I don't even remember what they were

2282
05:56:12,139 --> 05:56:20,020
I think I think I honestly I think I just said random numbers there

2283
05:56:20,580 --> 05:56:30,560
No, let me get this right all the dark souls games besides dark souls 2 are eights

2284
05:56:31,860 --> 05:56:35,540
I think yes, that's accurate. I like I got all jumbled up here

2285
05:56:36,099 --> 05:56:39,299
Dark souls 2 is a 6.5. Sekiro is a 7.9

2286
05:56:41,119 --> 05:56:46,560
Dark souls 3 8.5 dark souls 1 8.9 darks, uh

2287
05:56:47,119 --> 05:56:49,119
Bloodborne 9.7 done

2288
05:56:54,720 --> 05:56:56,959
Did I say was that what I said twilight princess? I didn't finish it

2289
05:56:58,669 --> 05:57:00,669
These are getting updated

2290
05:57:02,849 --> 05:57:05,090
What about left for dead 2 who cares?

2291
05:57:06,799 --> 05:57:08,799
You don't need my opinion on this

2292
05:57:08,799 --> 05:57:13,680
You've already played like a thousand hours of that game. You want me to tell you what I think about left for dead 2

2293
05:57:20,189 --> 05:57:24,189
You we both have probably one to two thousand hours and left for dead and left for dead 2

2294
05:57:24,909 --> 05:57:27,220
I don't think it really matters what I think at this point

2295
05:57:29,869 --> 05:57:31,869
It's great. It was very very good

2296
05:57:42,220 --> 05:57:44,529
TV robo 9.9

2297
05:57:46,130 --> 05:57:54,029
9.0 day's gone as a four on here. Oh shit. It's almost six hours. You're right

2298
05:57:58,029 --> 05:57:59,709
He's obsessed

2299
05:57:59,709 --> 05:58:02,080
No more heroes one and two

2300
05:58:02,080 --> 05:58:07,389
No more heroes of the games are kind of bad, but in a really really charming good way

2301
05:58:08,590 --> 05:58:12,509
I think both no more heroes games are like seven one and like seven four

2302
05:58:14,849 --> 05:58:26,659
That's not really bad

2303
05:58:26,659 --> 05:58:31,229
Refresh the page

2304
05:58:31,229 --> 05:58:33,229
Yeah, can I I don't think spores in eight five

2305
05:58:33,950 --> 05:58:37,950
Oh, but what but it came out it was revolutionary left for dead 2 is who cares?

2306
05:58:44,740 --> 05:58:50,500
That's I mean, but really though, it's like so everybody played that game with shit load does it matter

2307
05:58:55,619 --> 05:58:59,220
All right. I'm only gonna write three more games watch dogs legion

2308
05:59:00,029 --> 05:59:03,310
Watch dogs legion realistically was a

2309
05:59:04,169 --> 05:59:05,470
4.6

2310
05:59:05,470 --> 05:59:07,130
that game

2311
05:59:07,130 --> 05:59:11,330
Sucks and i'm not afraid to say it

2312
05:59:17,220 --> 05:59:18,819
Was it better than day's gone?

2313
05:59:18,819 --> 05:59:27,709
You know, it might actually be worse than day's gone. What is day's gone of four if that's a caliber for four

2314
05:59:28,029 --> 05:59:30,029
Watch dogs legion is a 3.6

2315
05:59:33,840 --> 05:59:35,840
That's only because your computer sucks

2316
05:59:39,229 --> 05:59:44,830
What that's my that was my experience with watch dogs legions. It's a it's got a 3.6

2317
05:59:45,470 --> 05:59:58,659
I was flipper. I was flippers in 8.4

2318
05:59:59,299 --> 06:00:02,619
If i'm gonna be realistic about it one more

2319
06:00:10,290 --> 06:00:12,290
Skyrim I can't write skyrim

2320
06:00:14,060 --> 06:00:15,970
I played

2321
06:00:15,970 --> 06:00:18,139
Two or three hours of skyrim

2322
06:00:18,540 --> 06:00:20,540
Modded the hell out of it made a bunch of monsters

2323
06:00:21,650 --> 06:00:23,169
Never played it again

2324
06:00:23,169 --> 06:00:25,169
And then watched it re-release

2325
06:00:25,169 --> 06:00:26,849
15 fucking times

2326
06:00:26,849 --> 06:00:28,930
I can't give you a rating. That's not rateable for me

2327
06:00:33,220 --> 06:00:34,900
hotline miami

2328
06:00:34,900 --> 06:00:37,860
Hotline miami 1 is an eight point

2329
06:00:40,610 --> 06:00:43,889
Nine hotline miami 2 is a seven

2330
06:00:57,139 --> 06:01:05,389
rhythm heaven

2331
06:01:05,389 --> 06:01:13,680
eight eight point five

2332
06:01:13,680 --> 06:01:17,500
bta 5

2333
06:01:17,500 --> 06:01:20,540
9.5. No, it's not it's a nine point. Yeah, it is 9.5

2334
06:01:21,180 --> 06:01:32,139
Gotcha for us. The game is a probably like a five point six

2335
06:01:33,279 --> 06:01:36,400
But I loved it so much that it raises it up in brackets

2336
06:01:37,040 --> 06:01:39,040
It's a seven point six

2337
06:01:39,360 --> 06:01:44,099
For some it's a five point six video game, but in brackets, it's a seven point six

2338
06:01:44,900 --> 06:01:54,560
Outer wilds eight point nine and then in brackets nine point one

2339
06:02:00,340 --> 06:02:02,819
Refresh the page it got to the page is deleted

2340
06:02:03,619 --> 06:02:06,689
There's nothing in here. You guys somebody deleted it all

2341
06:02:06,770 --> 06:02:09,439
What the fuck

2342
06:02:09,439 --> 06:02:16,060
It's it's gone

2343
06:02:16,060 --> 06:02:18,700
All right. I'll see you guys later. Goodbye. Good night. I gotta go

2344
06:02:20,880 --> 06:02:22,880
The next time you see me will be

06:02:24,130 --> 06:02:26,130
Uh, I will be back on monday

2346
06:02:30,819 --> 06:02:33,060
Either monday. Yeah monday i'll be back on monday

2347
06:02:34,979 --> 06:02:36,979
What time on monday though?

2348
06:02:37,220 --> 06:02:39,220
monday might be a later stream

2349
06:02:42,740 --> 06:02:45,939
We'll see maybe I gotta figure this out either monday or oh

2350
06:02:49,740 --> 06:02:50,700
I

2351
06:02:50,700 --> 06:02:51,900
hmm

2352
06:02:51,900 --> 06:02:55,299
I think I have an appointment on monday

2353
06:02:56,080 --> 06:02:58,319
We'll see check the sus it's either monday or tuesday

2354
06:02:58,880 --> 06:03:02,000
I'll see if I can stream on monday late if not then tuesday afternoon

2355
06:03:04,959 --> 06:03:07,409
great sorcery nine

2356
06:03:07,409 --> 06:03:10,209
sorcery one 9.0 sorcery two

2357
06:03:11,729 --> 06:03:13,490
9.8

2358
06:03:13,490 --> 06:03:15,330
sorcery three

2359
06:03:15,330 --> 06:03:17,330
7.5 sorcery four

2360
06:03:18,369 --> 06:03:20,049
6.8

2361
06:03:20,049 --> 06:03:23,220
Combine them all together sorcery two makes up most of the game

2362
06:03:27,419 --> 06:03:30,860
As a whole remember we weight them differently here. We weight them differently

2363
06:03:33,119 --> 06:03:34,400
I put

2364
06:03:34,400 --> 06:03:36,959
Like 75 weight into sorcery two

2365
06:03:39,470 --> 06:03:41,229
The rest of them just trickling

2366
06:03:41,229 --> 06:03:54,029
What do you mean? Wait w e i g h t

2367
06:03:54,669 --> 06:03:59,740
Go to bed jeremy. I mean, it's not that late

2368
06:04:00,380 --> 06:04:05,869
Right among us. I can't rate it n slash a not applicable. I have not played it

2369
06:04:06,750 --> 06:04:08,750
jewel wizardry, I mean

2370
06:04:10,020 --> 06:04:10,979
Two

2371
06:04:10,979 --> 06:04:13,380
That's a deck game is a two not even it's a 1.4

2372
06:04:15,790 --> 06:04:18,349
super frog super frog is a

2373
06:04:21,619 --> 06:04:23,619
a one but in brackets

2374
06:04:24,400 --> 06:04:34,509
9.5

2375
06:04:34,509 --> 06:04:36,509
Undertale. Oh boy

2376
06:04:37,200 --> 06:04:39,520
Oh boy, i'm about to rate

2377
06:04:40,380 --> 06:04:41,520
Undertale

2378
06:04:41,520 --> 06:04:43,119
This is where

2379
06:04:43,119 --> 06:04:46,799
This is where i'm good. Oh, this is best. It's gonna this is a monk a s scenario. I think

2380
06:04:47,959 --> 06:04:51,360
Undertale

2381
06:04:51,360 --> 06:04:53,659
Oh

2382
06:04:53,659 --> 06:04:58,139
If I gave outer wilds an 8.9 and I don't give undertale a 9.0

2383
06:05:02,560 --> 06:05:03,860
Undertale

2384
06:05:03,860 --> 06:05:05,860
Is definitely not

2385
06:05:05,939 --> 06:05:08,189
Um

2386
06:05:08,189 --> 06:05:11,069
This is a career end. This is a career ending statement possibly

2387
06:05:16,130 --> 06:05:20,639
It's it's a nine. It's at least a nine, but I don't know if it's I don't know if it's the nine that you think it is

2388
06:05:31,880 --> 06:05:33,880
zero point nine

2389
06:05:36,849 --> 06:05:48,669
Uh, it's undertale for me was a nine point nine point two

2390
06:05:49,849 --> 06:05:50,909
six

2391
06:05:50,909 --> 06:05:52,979
five

2392
06:05:52,979 --> 06:05:54,979
Not quite a nine point three, but it's almost there

2393
06:06:06,419 --> 06:06:08,419
And then in brackets for undertale

2394
06:06:09,090 --> 06:06:11,090
Point five one

2395
06:06:25,380 --> 06:06:29,299
Nine point two six five is locked in what about the brackets? You need the brackets are very important

2396
06:06:30,020 --> 06:06:43,630
And the mud the point five one gets added to the score. No, no, don't put the brackets there

2397
06:06:45,470 --> 06:06:51,380
Put no, no, no. Okay. What's the dude somebody do the math? What's the math? So it was nine point

2398
06:06:53,490 --> 06:06:55,490
Okay, you need to calculate it nine point

2399
06:06:58,700 --> 06:07:01,419
nine point six nine point two six five

2400
06:07:04,049 --> 06:07:05,409
plus

2401
06:07:05,409 --> 06:07:07,900
point five one

2402
06:07:07,900 --> 06:07:09,500
so in brackets

2403
06:07:09,560 --> 06:07:12,060
Undertale is a nine point. That's not accurate

2404
06:07:12,860 --> 06:07:14,860
No, no in bra and hold on

2405
06:07:14,939 --> 06:07:17,900
It would be point

2406
06:07:17,900 --> 06:07:19,900
All right in brackets. It's a nine point

2407
06:07:20,520 --> 06:07:21,979
three

2408
06:07:21,979 --> 06:07:23,979
Two zero nine point three two zero

2409
06:07:24,220 --> 06:07:47,119
Nine point three two zero in the brackets. I have to go. All right, well we're going brackets if we're multiplying

2410
06:07:47,119 --> 06:07:49,599
No brackets are four that could be the score two

2411
06:07:50,750 --> 06:07:53,630
On a given day. However, I might feel like giving it that one

2412
06:07:53,790 --> 06:07:58,349
I have to give two scores sometimes because on a given moment it could range between those two

2413
06:07:58,669 --> 06:08:00,669
It could be one of the it could be one of the other

2414
06:08:01,150 --> 06:08:07,740
All right. Good night. Goodbye. I'll see you later. I'll see you on monday or tuesday. Have a great weekend everybody. Take care of yourselves

2415
06:08:08,380 --> 06:08:10,380
Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for watching as always

2416
06:08:11,069 --> 06:08:12,560
See you soon

2417
06:08:12,560 --> 06:08:14,560
Good night. Goodbye

2418
06:08:17,119 --> 06:08:21,470

2419
06:08:21,790 --> 06:08:24,990
