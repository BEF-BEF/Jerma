1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:23,879
Do I seriously have to immediately stop playing this game? Because of me having to vomit?

2
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,879
Alright, well let's just get...

3
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:36,969
Oh no. No. You can't even see everything. It's like 2D on 3D.

4
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:44,039
Like, I have no depth perception. I can't even tell what... am I close to this thing or am I far away from it? Let's find out.

5
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,780
I guess I was pretty close. Okay, let's just go this... can I jump?

6
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
Oh, okay I can jump.

7
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,810
Sick jump. What the hell is that?

8
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,390
What the fuck are those things?

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,489
What are these, like, little muppet things? These little, like, weevils?

10
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,439
Can these hurt me?

11
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,790
It's...

12
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,609
Okay, can I jump on them?

13
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,609
I don't think so.

14
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,609
Come on, last try.

15
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,609
Okay, it's very evident that I can't do anything with these things.

16
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,609
These, like, daffy duck green, like, mob and mosh and things, alright?

17
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's just keep going. Apparently I touched him again.

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,200
I love how... did you guys hear that?

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Aren't these game designers wonderful?

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Is what that thing just said. Aren't these game designers wonderful?

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,379
I think that was a joke. That was a pretty good joke.

22
00:01:52,379 --> 00:02:00,310
Considering this game probably gave horrible nightmares to a bunch of kids that played it.

23
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,310
I never played this back in the day.

24
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,349
I don't even know... did this ever even release? I don't even remember this being on store shelves.

25
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,349
Good grab. Oh, good animations.

26
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,280
Can I jump over this wall?

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
What are the point of these enemies if they can't move?

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
What the fuck was that?

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
He's, like, spitting at me like a Jurassic Park spitter.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,590
Get me out of here.

31
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,590
Get that spitter away from me.

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,330
Oh, I'm invincible.

33
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,530
Oh my god.

34
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,050
How am I supposed to move this? Can I grab this rocket?

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,539
Can I even change the camera?

36
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,710
Dude, is this thing moving very slowly?

37
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,710
I feel like it is, but I have no perception at all.

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,710
So I don't even know what's happening. I don't even know if anything's even going on.

39
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,710
If I'm gonna run into this rocket and see what happens.

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:08,860
What? I have one really important question for you guys.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,300
You don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but I just really need to...

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,240
Need a clip. Good clip. Need a clip.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
You like that clip? Need a clip.

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,629
Hi, Gemma. I didn't get the joke.

45
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,629
Star! Hey, everybody, Star is in the video!

46
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,629
Whoa! Whoa!

47
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,900
My, like, parents are, like, yelling down here.

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
They think I'm, like, in trouble.

49
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Hold on a second. This might be funny.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
This could be, like, pretty funny.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,169
Come on, come down here. Aren't you concerned that your, like, son just got in trouble?

52
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,979
Whoa!

53
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:53,710
No!

54
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,710
Game over! Fuck you, game over!

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,639
Need a clip? Good clip.

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Do you want to continue?

57
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,009
Uh, I kind of have to continue because I need a clip.

58
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,009
Want to continue? Good to continue.

59
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,759
Good to continue. Need to continue? Good to continue.

60
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,759
Oh, I know all the strats. You see, now I can speedrun this.

61
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,759
World record's going to be two minutes and 35 seconds.

62
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,759
There it is. Look at that.

63
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
That's what we call a speedrun. See?

64
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
I wanted to do that because I could jump down.

65
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,259
Speedrun. This way.

66
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,259
Touch that arrow because, you know, it gives you an extra one up.

67
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,259
Go this way. That's my split.

68
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,430
All right, I'm 20 minutes ahead of the world record. Let's go.

69
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,129
Okay, it goes right... Oh, my God. I'm going to beat the world record.

70
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,620
Jeremy, are you okay?

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,620
What's happening down there?

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Are you in trouble? Are you sick?

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,439
Is the dog okay?

74
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,439
No, Mom. It's okay. I'm just playing Bubsy 3D.

75
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,810
The shittiest game I've ever played.

76
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,120
Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad.

77
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
And is that the Chester Cheeto on the screen?

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
No, Mom.

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Chester Cheeto. It's Bubsy.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
The lovable Bubsy. Oh, I've never seen that cartoon.

81
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
It's not a cartoon, Mom.

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,730
Geez.

83
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,569
See what you just made me do, Mom?

84
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,569
He just appeared.

85
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,569
That guy just, like, appeared.

86
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,060
Or I'm an idiot. I'm not sure.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Well, you should have been... Mom, you don't have to be a backseat gamer, okay?

88
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,259
I know what I'm doing.

89
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,259
See, I have to go this way. I'm still...

90
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,319
I'm going to, like, puke.

91
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,319
So, those of you that are asking why this video ends up being, like, four or five minutes,

92
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,319
it's because I'm out for your sake.

93
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,319
I don't want you to puke.

94
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,500
Because, like, I'm going to puke.

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,930
In fact, I think I already did puke.

96
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,740
I just, like, cut the video. You saw that cut.

97
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
I puked. All right? You want to know the truth?

98
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,240
I fucking puked.

99
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,670
Whoa!

100
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,300
Right when I talk about puking.

101
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Oh, stop doing that and just wait and be patient.

102
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,209
That thing is making so much noise.

103
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,339
Can I please just be level one?

104
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,899
If I complete level one, I'll be happy.

105
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,420
Just wait it out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,689
Okay, go.

107
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,019
I think I just beat level one.

108
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:37,769
Nice, like, cutscene.

109
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,769
Whoa, this is getting wacky.

110
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,009
Whoa!

111
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,500
He got squashed.

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Did you see that, guys? Bubsy just got squashed.

113
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,189
Let's move on to level two.

114
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,649
And by move on to level two, I mean, like, end the video.
