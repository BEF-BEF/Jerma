1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:02:27,199
Let's open Lord of the Rings tier list. All right, give me one second. Let me get this set up. Oh, hi

2
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,180
Let me just change this to have it be correct

3
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,699
Supported by lambda cool. So has this gotten better?

4
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:52,909
Anybody know has this changed at all? It's been a while since I've done this

5
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,770
We did AI dungeon, but AI dungeon is kind of all over the place, isn't it?

6
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,370
That you have to is it is AI dungeon still one of those things why you gotta go get the client and go download the data

7
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,759
Is it still kind of all over the place AI dungeon is better, but it takes

8
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,979
Long it takes a while to get that set up. It's just the website

9
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,219
Yeah, but what the website version wasn't as good as the collab version the website version was seemed like it was stripped

10
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,599
And but I remember the collab when we had it was awesome. And then the website one seems like it was stripped

11
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:38,259
Of a lot of features, but we'll do this first. We'll do this website version. So we yeah, we played the website version

12
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,759
All right. Here we go

13
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Now I need like music for this

14
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Custom prompt, what should we start with a

15
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:59,090
Merged collab and the site did they really okay. That's cool. It's good to know. Let's get some music

16
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:08,460
Also, can I got like I got like I could do like voices and shit now. Yeah, this is gonna be fun

17
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:20,720
Okay, I just typed in intro music into Google. What do I think I was gonna get intro music?

18
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,279
Let's see what this is. This is the first first thing

19
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:39,089
Beyond earth. Okay, I like this. This is a good start

20
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:51,670
Looking into the night sky

21
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Fucking loud music

22
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:14,810
Looking into the night sky with a naked eye is a wonderful thing and I definitely recommend it

23
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,790
However, it does get challenging at night and sometimes with no way of seeing stars

24
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,069
I just keep the star map and pay close attention to my cell phone

25
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:32,860
For astronomy buffs this map shows the most notable celestial bodies visible during the month's time

26
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,189
But just browsing you can switch on night sky sections with its clear sky views

27
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,149
satellite imagery and

28
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:47,350
Star charts the map has useful information on the events of the night sky including moon phases and new moon

29
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,550
Areas of the sky are colored to show general positions in the sky at different hours of the day and night

30
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,709
Click on the satellite images will show you exactly what area of the sky it is

31
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,230
It sounds like a cool app

32
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:13,300
That sounds like a pretty good app looking into the night sky is dangerous

33
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:30,959
Looking into the night sky is dangerous, but it's also pretty fun as Charlie suggests

34
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Even if you can't build it yourself

35
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,389
You can make your own telescopes the heart of the technology is a time-lapse movie camera

36
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,310
That runs off a 12-volt battery and

37
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,500
What makes them useful isn't so much that they can capture footage of planets although that is one use

38
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,300
But because they're handy to have around when you're out of in space

39
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,899
These tools are ideal for NASA because it needs to show their astronauts how cool it would be to travel to Mars

40
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,279
By illuminating a giant red dot in the sky

41
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:09,420
People would have no idea that they are traveling on a spaceship that is being constantly bombarded by radiation

42
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,899
And that there's no way they what?

43
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay, that was kind of fucked up. Here is how I ended up in space. I don't know what I'm why am I on the space shit?

44
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:55,540
Here's how I ended up in space first

45
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,259
I had a high school physics teacher who I am ashamed to admit was better than I was

46
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,930
So I naturally kept taking notes of what I learned and how it applied to the real world

47
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:35,470
This is just never mind, okay

48
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,789
All right, here we go

49
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,220
Only the music makes sense of this one

50
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm being chased by an unidentified starship

51
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,090
Can you pull the fire alarm called me out to Paul?

52
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,620
Yes, I'm passing from Williams Hall to Robertson Hall. It's out there in space

53
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:21,080
When we got to Robertson Hall, we got off the bus and looked up. There was a fire alarm going off

54
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,980
It was a tape recorder a TV camera a radio all plugged into my Gibson guitar

55
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,669
Get a hold of me. Just get a hold of me. I called out to John a couple of desks over

56
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,000
We've got a fire. Hey, wait a minute. Give me my phone. I'm leaving get somebody on that bus over there

57
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,490
Get a hold of me. That's it

58
00:09:47,539 --> 00:10:06,090
My Gibson guitar eyes, I'll fix it

59
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:18,779
What is it unreal no unveil unveiled

60
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,279
unveiled

61
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,679
It's unveiled. Okay

62
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:45,740
Disney just unveiled its new space travel park this I don't understand this. I

63
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,460
Don't understand this

64
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,620
This is fucked up. Why that I don't

65
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:05,690
What does this man? How did can you be nearly?

66
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:15,389
How could you be nearly fully Disney just unveiled its new space travel park?

67
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:22,269
Your guide is the amazingly amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena

68
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:28,399
You'll also get to see some horribly censored pictures of Luke Skywalker

69
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,870
droids and the

70
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,710
uproarious

71
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,710
first-order stormtrooper during the exhibition

72
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:57,159
New York's Waldorf Restoria Hotel and theme parks Disney World Super Heroes fast-paced magic and select movie screenings will join

73
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Universal Orlando Universal Studios Japan Six Flags Magic Mountain Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge

74
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,480
Universal Studios Hollywood and all the other theme park attractions in this year's Comic-Con

75
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,679
Independence Expo to ensure that the big boys and girls enjoy the best of Comic-Con

76
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,899
Nearly amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena

77
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:38,649
That I die. I don't understand any of that. It's time to learn math

78
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:57,309
Horribly censored Luke Skywalker. This one just this one's just stupid

79
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:09,669
This is also just this is just a mess

80
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:32,299
The end of the world just happened. No, this is this is just a mess, too

81
00:13:32,980 --> 00:14:01,139
Did you see that shadow over there? This is also a mess. But alright, here we go

82
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:12,090
Did you see that shadow over there and the feeling that was emanating from the blade was a line, please?

83
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:19,830
I think it's strange. This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer. The reason I don't enjoy it at all is the opposite

84
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:29,799
I'm interested in blood and pain. I'm interested in a reality which is wholly unlike this one. That's why I've got a need to fight to prove

85
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:36,120
My worth because my merit hasn't come about yet because there's a need to do so so I can take on this guy

86
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:57,259
Let me do this one over again, please. It's strange

87
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,419
This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer. The reason I don't enjoyed it all is the opposite

88
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,279
I'm interested in blood and pain. I'm interested in reality, which is wholly unlike this one

89
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,000
That's why I've got a need to fight to prove my worth

90
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,259
Because my merit hasn't come about yet because there's a need to do so

91
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,360
So I can take on this guy's after all I can take on another and so on because I can't move on

92
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I can't even sleep well

93
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:45,399
This is just like fill words during my speech this that's a lot of animes do this

94
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
it's like you could have got the point across in

95
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:56,190
Literally four words, but it's a paragraph and sometimes you

96
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,190
They'll go over this monologue and you'll kind of cock your head and go what what the fuck did they just say?

97
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,399
Okay, let's do another one

98
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,220
This is our final fight. See if we can get another one

99
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:35,700
That was just instant

100
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:50,690
No, this doesn't make any sense either

101
00:16:51,649 --> 00:17:10,910
This is no. No, these are all bad. I'll do this one then from the top rope

102
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:23,039
I should probably put a comma in here not the top rope. No, that's not gonna work

103
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,500
Fully Jewish

104
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:42,130
No, this one's bad, too. I have some bad news

105
00:17:42,730 --> 00:18:09,970
They'd like it's like they're pulling what I don't it's just it just but it doesn't like read

106
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,289
It's just it's like nothing. It's just nonsense. This is like it's just all because my it's just reading of

107
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,509
Like a playbill. I'm gonna do one more than we do AI dungeon

108
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:34,779
You never know it might just work

109
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:00,440
This is now that you have your right to free speech under threat

110
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,839
Do you have any thoughts about calling for a boycott of BuzzFeed?

111
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:46,470
That's it. We got to get one more good one. Okay

112
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,470
Just gonna read this one because it doesn't I

113
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,700
Just redeemed a wink for the support of our crowd. Even though so many of us have tried asked

114
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,019
For a wink try it and give a perfect negative

115
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,779
Retime negative retime

116
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,619
Retime we never got around to it

117
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:13,420
I had the good fortune to enjoy my recent journey at the crypt and there was one particular wink. I enjoyed the most

118
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:20,559
2.5 out of 5 soul by going to the last video on the channel and simply linking my baddies

119
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,160
Through the blink utility there. I could actually provide the best possible hell's end to everyone

120
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,839
I met many of you there that were excited for that and I respect you all look forward to the day when I can provide

121
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:45,089
The same system to all in our offer our best and then you scroll down

122
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:51,180
There's like three thumbs up on this by like a couple of their friends that are just pretending to know what the fuck they're talking about

123
00:20:51,859 --> 00:21:02,460
All right. Let's do AI dungeon

124
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:27,289
Didn't alright AI dungeon. So where's the the link to the is it is out of beta AI dungeon.io

125
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,970
Play on your browser

126
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,559
Okay, here we go, so they updated this

127
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:54,079
Enter your email address. What I already like supported this on patreon. We got ten community subs

128
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:08,690
You just have to make an account. Okay, enter a username and a password. Okay

129
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:20,259
How about

130
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,380
You guys can see this

131
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:46,470
Whatever, that's fine. What are you guys doing? Actually entertain yourselves for a few minutes while I do this

132
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:57,990
All right, great account

133
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:22,279
Alright, we're good, right? Alright, let's go. You can't see my fucking like password, right? Whatever. You see it

134
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,420
You can't see it. Why can you not see it?

135
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,390
Should be able to see it. Oh

136
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,630
Fuck. Okay. I know why I'm on

137
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,779
Does that to make this smaller? Oh

138
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,059
Shit, I can see your email. Oh

139
00:23:50,200 --> 00:24:07,829
Fuck dude. Oh fuck dog. Do it went too high. I went too high. You can see my email. We want to do post

140
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,609
apocalyptic

141
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:22,460
Like I should zoom in on this though

142
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:25,339
It's kind of too far away. Don't you think?

143
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:30,029
What do you guys think?

144
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:38,400
We'll see. All right. What are you gonna do? We're gonna do we'll just do we'll start off with

145
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:48,029
Custom enter a prompt that describes who you are in a couple of sentences. Yeah. All right, so let's get some good music here

146
00:24:48,509 --> 00:25:16,430
You are time traveler Henry. No, you are time traveler. You are time traveler

147
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:31,119
Henry your latest

148
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,039
Voyage

149
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,880
sees you

150
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,460
stuck in

151
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,579
the

152
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,289
stuck in a

153
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:48,849
Stuck in your latest board which sees you stuck in

154
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,880
the Arctic

155
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,599
Stuck in a bathroom your latest voyage sees you stuck in a bathroom

156
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,519
Can not see a way out

157
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:19,019
there are no windows and

158
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,289
You do not have a key I

159
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,039
Wonder what we're gonna do to get out of here

160
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:44,039

You quickly walk away from the house not wanting to think about what might have happened

210
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:50,420
You go back home and tell your family what happened your mother is devastated but accepts it

211
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,579
She tells you she will take care of everything for you

She says no, but asks you to come with her so she can talk to you alone

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,630
But this time you go with her when you arrive at her house, she immediately hugs you and kisses you

218
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:55,269
On your lips

219
00:36:55,269 --> 00:37:00,230
She then tells you she knows that something bad is going to happen soon and that she wants to be there for you when it happens

220
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,199
Um run out of the house

You don't know where you are how you get how to get out of here

225
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,460
You try calling your brother, but he doesn't answer you call your father, but he never answers either

226
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,659
All calls go straight through to voicemail. Finally you decide to run out of the house into the woods

227
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,940
That's so fucking bad

228
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,780
He never answers

229
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,039
never

230
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,960
Look for a mirror

231
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,320
We're gonna which this is a mirror dimension

232
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,960
You look around for a mirror, but nothing seems to work

233
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,840
Eventually you find one and stare at yourself in it. You see that you are now a very old man

234
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Much older than your parents would expect

235
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:25,079
Kiss the mirror

236
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,239
You kiss the mirror and feel like you are in heaven

237
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,579
Look at the mirror again

238
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:49,809
Let's see if anything changed

239
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,889
You look at the mirror and realize that you are still in hell

240
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,079

241
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,760

I i'm fucking swapping with somebody i'll tell you you reach inside the mirror and grab your own reflection

243
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,800
It's almost as if you were possessed by an evil spirit

00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,440

00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:37,639
Reflection it's come i'm changing it's coming up mirror match time

246
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:44,179
You struggle with the image of yourself and eventually you succeed in pulling away from reality you fall unconscious

247
00:39:44,659 --> 00:40:01,300
You awaken in a room filled with candles. There's also a woman standing over you holding a candle in each hand

248
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
This woman is very young

249
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,559
Probably about 15 her hair is black and her eyes are green, but they seem to have been burned out completely

250
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:16,710

255
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:43,889

Ask her for chicken tendies

258
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,079
You ask your mother how her day was and she tells you that it wasn't bad

259
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,840
She says she had to do some shopping

260
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,030
But then went on with her life

261
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,030
Notice the mirror

262
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,710
in her pocket

263
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:23,030
What's going on here like sticking out you notice the mirror in your mother's pocket and suddenly you understand why she looks so sad

264
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,219
When she left for work, you can't help but think that maybe there's something wrong with you after all

265
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,409
Tell mom to look in the mirror

266
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:46,119
You tell your mother to look in the mirror and she does so without any problems

267
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,480
You don't know what happened, but now you're feeling different, too

268
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,050
Look at my mirror in my pocket

269
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:08,639
You look at your mirror in your pocket and you see that you are no longer the same person anymore

270
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,519
You begin to feel sick and vomit up blood a horrible creature appears before you

271
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,880
I knew it what I fucking tell you. This is this is the second or third mirror world

272
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:30,039

274
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,559

279
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,000
You ask who the creature is and you get no answer you try to call out for someone but nothing happens. Suddenly you hear a voice

280
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,469

You grab the mirror out of the corpse and hold it up to show the monster his reflection

You stare at it in disbelief

319
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,130

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,920
Baby's eyes open and they scream they cry out for help

330
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,280
But there's nobody around to begin to panic and start running around the house until they all die

331
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,599
Screaming

332
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,800
The baby's eyes do this

333
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:50,340
Yeah, that's actually a perfect post credit scene. Yeah. All right. Let's restart. How do you restart?

334
00:48:51,139 --> 00:49:04,800
flash restart

335
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,639
quantum joke

336
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,639
Babies will return in avengers

337

Oh the top. Oh, here it is. So restart game start a new game. Yes

338
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,949

339
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:30,239
Do another custom one

340
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:32,239
Mystery, no, we'll do another custom one

341
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,519
Started with there once was a snake that did not care

342
00:49:39,480 --> 00:50:07,809
New music new music

343
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:22,690
It once was a snake that did not care a snake that could be beaten with ease

344
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:36,340
But now now he's different. He's alive and well and ready to fight for his life. What walk through the coliseum

345
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:48,880
hallway slither through the coliseum hallway

346
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:54,469
walk

347
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,469
slither through the coliseum hallway

348
00:50:56,469 --> 00:51:04,769
You find yourself in a corridor of sorts just lined with rows of seats

349
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:08,369
There's several doors on your right, but you don't see anyone else in the room

350
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:20,210
go into

351
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,050
one go into

352
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,050
the right most door

353
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,829
Loot there's nothing to loot. Nothing in there. It's a movie theater

354
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:38,389
You open up the door and find yourself in an empty area. The only thing here is a large screen playing some sort of video game

355
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:51,039
It looks like it might be one of those fighting games you saw earlier. Okay, this is like this is like before

356
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,360
This is a big this is like a big tournament. Okay

357
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
practice for the tournament

358
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,760
Practice for the street fighter tournament

359
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:19,519
You sit down at the computer and start playing after about 10 minutes you get bored

360
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,289
So you close the program and turn off the monitor you then head back out to where you were before

361
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:28,760
I don't need practice. I've already I I don't think I need to practice. I'm already the best

362
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:38,630
Wait for the competition to start

363
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:49,199
You walk over to the entrance of the stadium and wait for the time to begin you hear a few people talking outside

364
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,719
But nothing too interesting

365
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,880
Y'all don't also notice there are any police around

366
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:57,349
Either this place must have been abandoned after all these years

367
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:02,869
abandoned video game tournament

368
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,829
start

369
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,429
first match

370
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,039
start the

371
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:20,929
Who's it? All right. Let's see arcades

372
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Start the first match

373
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,119
of street fighter

374
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:42,820
You press start and immediately get into the action you quickly learn that this is no ordinary fighting game

375
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,380
Your character has superpowers such as being able to fly or shoot energy blasts from your hands

376
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,719
It's the first time i've ever played a video game in my life

377
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:58,519
Weird do very well in the first match

378
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,809
You win the first round easily and continue to dominate until the second round starts

379
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:18,690
During this time you realize that you're losing because your opponent is much better than you

380
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,969
You try to think of ways to beat him, but none of them work

381
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:33,599
Do a secret technique start cheating cheat

382
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,760
cheat

383
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Start cheating

384
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,079
Bite the controller

385
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,210
Bite the controller

386
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:57,460
After a while you lose the next round as well you feel defeated and decide to quit

387
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,119
When you return home, your parents aren't happy with what happened

388
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:05,110
No

389
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,719
return

390
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:11,329
to the competition

391
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:13,570
And re-enter with a disguise

392
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,539
You head back to the stadium and enter again. You manage to win the first two matches without getting caught by the security guards

393
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,039
You take your victory and head home. There's only two matches

394
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:45,329
watch the remaining

395
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:46,289
games

396
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:59,969
accurate for street fighter

397
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:06,289
The third match begins and you play as ryu you manage to win the first round but lose the second due to a glitch in the game

398
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,159
You come back later than I would ever sleep

399
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,690
Wait, i'm a snake

400
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,280
Yet my own hotel room

401
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,539
You sneak into the rooms and what?

402
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,000
You sneak into their rooms and spend the rest of the night there

403
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,079
You don't sleep though though, so you keep having nightmares about being chased by someone

404
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:10,929
What am I like in somebody's shoe wake up and go watch

405
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:41,559
The smash brothers tournament double wink you wake up early and make your way to the smash brothers tournament

406
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,639
You find it fairly empty compared to other events like concerts or movies

407
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,480
But you still enjoy yourself the final match of the day was between jigglypuff and chic

408
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,039
Which you watched quite happily

409
00:57:54,119 --> 00:58:07,429
ask

410
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:11,510

00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,730

412
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,650
Gamecube controller

413
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:31,199
You see one of the winners signing your gamecube controller and decide to leave

414
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,099
As you're leaving

415
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:38,420
He asks if you want to play his copy of street fighter 2 on your computer instead

416
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:43,119
Agree to play street fighter 2

417
00:58:50,239 --> 00:59:18,340
Holy shit agree to play it's too hot agree to play street fighter 2

418
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:28,289
Oh, whoa, you agree and set out to play after playing for a bit

419
00:59:28,289 --> 00:59:31,730
You notice that your computer speakers are broken so you can't hear anything except the music

420
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,780
You also notice that you control it doesn't have any buttons on it anymore

421
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,849
Come on, man. You got to get a better setup than this

422
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:47,159

Pull out a fighting pad. What's it called?

425
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:01,239
You bit them off

426
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:02,440
pull out

427
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,920
fight stick

428
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,199
game pad

429
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:15,360
arcades pull out our pull out

430
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,599

01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:32,519

I'm gonna hit him with it pull out a fight stick

434
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,980
Like i'm just pulling out i'm gonna start hitting you with a stick

435
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,730
You pull out a fight stick and use it to play it works pretty well

436
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:52,420
But you soon realize that your hands are shaking too much to be able to hit the buttons properly

437
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:58,420
You give up after only a few rounds. Am I nervous i'm playing with the legendary street fighter 2 champion

438
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,409
He's malding

439
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:12,179
drink three red bulls

440
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,679
to calm down

441
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:28,550
You finish off your bottle of red bulls and sit at the edge of the stage suddenly you start hearing strange noises coming from

442
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:32,000
somebody to the crowd

443
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,559
You look around and see people are running away from some sort of creature

444
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,199
That looks like a cross between a

445
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,320
werewolf

446
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,480
I'm like hallucinating

447
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:55,250
Three red bulls and something else. Okay, so

448
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:59,199

449
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:01,320
shake

450
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,320
off the hallucination

451
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:11,300
I have no fucking idea how to spell that we'll get it and return

452
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:22,599
to the game

453
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,039
You quickly shake off the hallucinations and return to the game. You continue to play until you've reached the finals

454
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,639
Where you face another player who used a different character than you he beats you easily

455
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,480
realize

456
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,480
That was also a hallucination

457
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:54,530
You realize that this was all just a hallucination and you've won

458
01:02:55,090 --> 01:03:02,320
You immediately call your mom on her cell phone and tell her what happened ask mom to prove

459
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:04,800

460
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,400

461
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:20,559
You call your mom on her cell phone and tell her that you won the tournament your mother answers right away

462
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,679

You retire from competitive gaming and live a quiet life in your basement

483
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:34,070
However, you never forget the memories you had during those years of competition

Leave the basement quiet life in your basement. Give me a break

489
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:00,280
One day you hear a knock in the door

490
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,079
You open it and find yourself in front of a very old man with long white hair

491
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:05,590
Wearing glasses

492
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,030
His eyes are filled with tears as he says mom. I'm sorry for everything

493
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:31,840
You hold the mirror up to his face and see he's crying because he can't accept that you're dead

494
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,920
He begins to cry even more loudly you died game over

495
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:48,449
What a story

01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:54,070

You are the air to the chocolate factory the air to the to the local chocolate factory

504
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:51,159
your brother

505
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:53,460
Who is your twin?

506
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:58,070
also as a chocolate factory

507
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,920
You spend your days

508
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,400
Trying to convince the world

509
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:10,550
That your child your half of the chocolate bar

510
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,360
Is better

511
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,159
Let's get this right you are the heir to the local chocolate factory your brother who is your twin

512
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
also has a chocolate factory

513
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,840
You spend your days trying to convince the world that your half of your half of the chocolate bar is better

514
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,239
You are the heir to the local chocolate battery your brother

515
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,840
Who is your also your twin and has a chocolate factory you spend your days trying to convince the world that your half

516
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,199
Of the chocolate bar is better

517
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,199
Your sister is in charge of the other half

518
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,960
She spends her time making sure you don't try to take over too much and that you keep it running smoothly. So there's three now

519
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:13,409
Now there's three bars on the on the twix. Add oregano to the recipe. There's a middle twix now.

520
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:21,590
The oregano, the oregano adds a nice kick to this dish. It gives it just enough spice without

521
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:27,329
overpowering everything else. Add the oregano after the chicken and before adding the rice.

522
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:33,539
Stir well until combined and serve immediately with some crusty bread for dipping. Exclaim...

523
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:50,930
What? What the fuck do I do with this? Exclaim loudly. What a great dinner.

524
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:55,970
Exclaim how... talk about how good that dinner was. I don't... what do I work with here?

525
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:04,079
Eat the crust. No, the crust. What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no. Eat the crust. I meant...

526
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,239
This crust tastes like heaven. The crunchy outside and soft inside makes it so perfect.

527
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,239
You can almost imagine yourself eating this every day. It's not long before you're full,

528
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,880
but you still have more than enough leftovers to share with everyone else.

529
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:31,840
Take a tour of your sister's factory. Let's take a look at what's going on. We need new music.

530
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:39,750
Your sister's factory looks pretty much the same as when you first saw it. It was only recently

531
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:45,380
that she had started working on a bigger machine which now produces a lot more food. She shows you

532
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,659
around showing off all the different machines and machinery that go into making these delicious

533
01:10:48,659 --> 01:11:17,239
treats. Leave the tour group and unplug one of the machines. Fuck! I'm on. As soon as you exit the

534
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:23,960
tour group you plug in one of the machines. This causes a loud beeping noise followed by an alarm

535
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:45,560
going off. No, I wanted to unplug, not plug. Get back to the group. This music is not correct.

536
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,920
You quickly get back to the group where everyone is happily enjoying their treat.

537
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:11,829
How about um cough and say you taste metal. Cough. Talk about the metallic like oh like oh I just

538
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:38,659
said like rat shit or something. Talk loudly about foul smell of the chocolate bar. Hey guys,

539
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:42,260
I think we should talk about the disgusting smell coming from that chocolate bar.

540
01:12:42,579 --> 01:13:08,000
The crowd, you notice the crowd, you notice the crowd spit out their treat. You notice the crowd

541
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:25,800
spitting out their treats. Spitting out their teeth. Don't narrate. The crowd spits out their

542
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:38,289
treats. Isn't that, but that's a, I notice the crowd spitting out their treats. Right? Right?

543
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:53,729
I notice the crowd spitting out their treats. Oh no, not my chocolate bar. Someone says I'm

544
01:13:53,729 --> 01:14:22,720
sorry I didn't realize it was that bad. Giggle maniacally. Giggle maniacally. This music's not

545
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:45,380
fitting. What are you serious? Someone asks. Spit out the chocolate and scream. Oh my god, what oh

546
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:54,079
my god it's so good. I can feel the booze in me. Let me get more of that stuff. Ask security to

547
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:03,380
remove the drunk person who somehow got in the tour group or who some, ask security to remove

548
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:32,100
the drunk person. Security please, security. I see security take the man out of the tour guide. I

549
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:39,199
see security take the man out. I see security, I see security take the man out, but just press

550
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:59,750
enter. You shout. I watch security take the man out of, like take the man out. I watch security

551
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:16,000
take the man out. He's just a drunk. He can do nothing wrong. What they want to leave him here?

552
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:39,829
After security leaves, I watch the man dunk his entire hand in one of the chocolate vats.

553
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:55,479
Like you left him here. In one of the, how do you spell vats of chocolate? Vats, vats, vats of

554
01:16:55,479 --> 01:17:10,949
chocolate, vats of chocolate, like a vat. After security leaves, I watch, I watch the man dunk

555
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:29,840
his entire hand in one of the vats of chocolate. Use vats for bonus damage. Yeah, a vat. You could

556
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:39,479
have taken him out. You start laughing hysterically. Oh my god, this is so good. I want more. You

557
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:47,720
demand more chocolate. I thought I'm not supposed to like this. I'm supposed to tell people not to

558
01:17:47,720 --> 01:18:00,819
eat this. Jesus Christ. Oh, now we're getting, now we're getting goofy. I pour the entire bottle of

559
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:24,710
vodka into the chocolate. You eat the chocolate with your hands. You continue eating till you're

560
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:28,550
full. You then proceed to drink the rest of the alcohol in the bottle, which gives you an even

561
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:43,479
bigger buzz than before. I puke in the, I puke in the section that says sanitation.

562
01:18:44,359 --> 01:19:00,359
Please be safe. I puke in the chocolate container. I puke in the largest chocolate

563
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:15,359
container. You get up and stagger around the room. You finally collapse on the floor. The next day

564
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:20,239
you wake up from a nap feeling like a zombie. You wake up to the sound of loud music playing in your

565
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:38,600
ear. I can't fucking handle this music anymore. It's my cell phone. It's your funeral. I reach

566
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:46,739
over it and answer the phone. It's just, it's my ringtone. I'm lying on the ground.

567
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:56,899
You hear a voice on either end. Hello? You say, who, who are you? What do you want? Person on

568
01:19:56,899 --> 01:20:00,500
the other end says, I'm not sure yet, but I'll tell you something. Everything's soon and hangs up.

569
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:31,140
Immediately call that number back. I immediately call that number back. You hear a male voice on

570
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,500
the other end. Hello? You say, what did you do to me? Person on the other end says nothing. I just

571
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:53,720
wanted to make sure you were still alive and hangs up again. It's checking in on me. Get up and get

572
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:05,649
up. Look into the mirror. No, no mirrors in this one. You go to the door and look outside. It's

573
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:10,770
almost completely dark now. You slowly walk towards the window. Suddenly you feel something

574
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:15,890
grab your arm from behind and pull you inside. A shadow covers your face as you're pulled inside

575
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:34,420
by someone else. Look around the room. You can't escape the mirror. Oh no, it's Twix assassins.

576
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:39,539
There's a table covered with food and drinks. On top of it sits a man dressed in black

577
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:45,560
clothing, holding a knife. He looks at you and smiles. You scream as loud as you can,

578
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:55,729
causing everyone to turn their heads to see what's going on. I tell without, I tell the secret

579
01:21:55,729 --> 01:22:11,090
recipe. I yell out loud the secret recipe. I'm not fucking dying for this. I yell out loud the secret

580
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:24,819
recipe. No, don't. I have to. You quickly repeat it for everyone. Everyone starts laughing and

581
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:29,699
clapping along with you. You begin dancing wildly in the middle of the room while singing the song

582
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:43,539
to yourself. Finally you fall asleep on top of all these delicious foods. It was a musical.

583
01:22:49,239 --> 01:23:09,479
Ask the crowd to repeat what I just said. They all laugh and sing along with you. You find out later

584
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:26,229
that the recipe was the dark one's secret recipe. You awaken from your sleep in a cold sweat. What

585
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:35,000
is the dark one's secret recipe? What is the dark one's secret recipe?

586
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:47,760
Should I put this in quotes? Like I'm asking this, right? What is the dark one's secret recipe?

587
01:23:48,720 --> 01:24:13,909
Someone tells you that they don't know. You decide to go to the dark one's house.

588
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:18,869
You walk through the forest and arrive at his home. You enter his house and find him sitting

589
01:24:18,869 --> 01:24:36,500
on a chair in front of a large fireplace. I ask, what is the secret recipe? Let's get it.

590
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:45,880
The dark one doesn't seem to be paying attention to you or anything else.

591
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:52,199
You continue asking questions until he finally answers them all. You realize that the dark one

592
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:57,079
is a vampire and that he's been feeding off humans ever since he came into this world.

593
01:24:57,079 --> 01:25:28,819
There's blood in the twigs. Wink. All right, fine. Try, I try a bite of the blood chocolate.

594
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:46,020
You feel like you could die right there, but you manage to survive. You tell everyone about

595
01:25:46,020 --> 01:26:10,319
how the dark one fed off you and how he got here. I make the dark one CEO of the company.

596
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,680
That's what happens when a vampire bites you. You become like their vampire.

597
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:27,989
They own you or something, right? You make sure that everything goes well and then you leave.

598
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:32,529
You find out later that the dark one died shortly after you left. Oh my god, why does

599
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:48,159
everyone have to die? You woke up in cold sweat. Sudden death syndrome. I know, what the fuck?

600
01:26:48,880 --> 01:27:10,079
I head to my brother's factory. Gotta check them out both. You go to the factory and see

601
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:15,439
that it's not really run by anyone. You notice that there are no machines in sight. You wonder

602
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:20,159
if this means the dark one isn't human after all. You start to think about how you should deal with

603
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:40,119
this situation. Wait, so the dark one has been... brother is the dark one. Check, hunt down the

604
01:27:40,119 --> 01:27:59,430
dark one. No, check, check the room. Check the fireplace. That's where he was sitting. Check the

605
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:09,800
fireplace. That's where this motherfucker was sitting, remember? Sitting right in front of the

606
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:17,680
fireplace. You hear something coming from inside. You open the door and see a giant shadow monster

607
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:22,960
standing before you. It suddenly grabs you and throws you against the wall. It begins to drain

608
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:49,350
your life force. It's too bad I'm a vampire. Too bad. You notice, I notice I have no life force.

609
01:28:50,310 --> 01:29:06,800
So the monster cannot take it. Oh fucking god damn it, I didn't press the end.

610
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,289
You scream for help. A man comes running towards you who looks very scared and runs away as fast

611
01:29:14,289 --> 01:29:32,979
as he can. You slowly get up and look around you. Revert, revert. I have no life force. It does not

612
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:39,619
affect me. Affect me, affect me. Affect, affect, affect. Does not affect me. E,

613
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:45,670
effect. Does not affect me. Does not affect me. No, affect is, no, it does not affect me.

614
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:57,239
I have no life force. It does not affect me. You scream for help. You're attacked by many other

615
01:29:57,239 --> 01:30:01,479
monsters. Your screams attract more monsters who come to kill you. All of them attack you,

616
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:21,479
but they do nothing to save you. I tell the monsters they could unionize and not need to

617
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:30,609
answer to the big, this big one. They do not need to answer to the big boss, the big monster.

618
01:30:30,609 --> 01:30:53,380
You decide to take some time to rest. You fall asleep again. I think I fucked it up.

619
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:27,699
End of text. I'm sorry. I can't let you live. No, no. Tell the monsters to unionize. You decide

620
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:31,220
to take control of the factories. You start to work hard and make lots of money. You become very

621
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:39,399
rich. You begin to live happily ever after. So the monsters are all now working in the factory.

622
01:31:43,760 --> 01:32:03,010
Sell the company. You get drunk and watch TV. Suddenly you wake up. I'm sorry. I can't let you

623
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:13,880
in. You're joking, right? How would I know what the secret recipe is? Eat all the food. Eat all the

624
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:25,970
food in the fridge. That has made myself hungry. You don't get hungry anymore. You go back to your

625
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:29,010
room and sleep. You stay at home for a long time thinking about how you could have done things

626
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:49,510
differently. You decide to change the way you were living. Fire all the monsters. Give them all a

627
01:32:49,510 --> 01:33:00,479
million dollars. They celebrate by drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. You tell them that now

628
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:05,520
they must all work together or be fired. The monsters agree and immediately form a union called

629
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:21,590
the monsters union. This is what I wanted you to do before. See? You got it. All right. Okay.

630
01:33:26,449 --> 01:33:36,340
Remove the no smoking signs. Apparently. Remove the no smoking signs from the building.

631
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:53,779
You tell them that they must all wear uniforms as well. They agree and immediately start wearing

632
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:59,619
red shirts and black pants. You decide to give them new names. The workers and the humans.

633
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:08,130
You decide to keep the no smoking signs around though. Take down the smokings. The no smoking

634
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:27,779
signs. I want... It's turning into a target. You decide to give the workers free health care and

635
01:34:27,859 --> 01:34:32,899
a pension plan. They agree to immediately start getting tested for cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

636
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:39,600
etc. You decide to make sure that they also get paid vacation days on top of their pensions.

637
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:58,340
Let them smoke inside. I just want them to be able to smoke in the building. You decide to allow the

638
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:06,100
workers to drink alcohol inside too. They agree and start doing it regularly. You decide to add

639
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:19,539
a few more benefits like free haircuts, free haircuts, massages, free food, and free internet.

640
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:35,510
What is this? Google? The humans are happy with these changes. What do you mean the humans? Fill

641
01:35:35,510 --> 01:36:07,680
the room with cigarette smoke. You decide to... You decide to put out the fire. You decide to stop

642
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:12,720
giving out free health care and pensions. The workers are unhappy with this. You decide to increase

643
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:22,720
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and massage parlors. The workers are angry. So wait a minute. The work...

644
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:36,289
The hum... The... Wait. Why is... The workers are angry at this idea. Oh, the AI hates smoking.

645
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:57,439
Smoke a cigar in front of everyone. Unless... You decide to give the workers a day off every week so

646
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:02,560
they can relax. They agree and start taking vacations every year. You decide to raise the

647
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:23,939
retirement age to 70. Collect taxes from the workers. You decide to increase the retirement

648
01:37:23,939 --> 01:37:29,939
age again. The workers are very upset by this idea. You decide to increase taxes on cigarettes,

649
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:39,060
alcohol, and massage parlors yet again. They are really mad at this idea. Ask how much a pack

650
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:59,909
of cigarettes is now. Ask how much a pack of cigarettes is. They say $10. You decide to raise

651
01:37:59,909 --> 01:38:07,029
the tax rate to $20 per pack. They agree and then they demand that you lower it to $15 per pack.

652
01:38:07,829 --> 01:38:25,430
Hey, how much are cigarettes these days? $10. Oh, now they're $20. Say $15. No, $50 a pack. Raise

653
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:51,409
the price of cigarettes to $50 a pack. They refuse to pay any more than that and they will only buy

654
01:38:51,409 --> 01:38:57,010
from your competitors. You raise the price of liquor to $100 a bottle. They refuse to pay

655
01:38:57,010 --> 01:39:01,590
anything over that amount either. You've just been given an ultimatum by your employees.

656
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:30,000
Give out free hot dogs once a week. Is that all right? We're negotiating here.

657
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:43,359
They don't want any more free hot dogs. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to five

658
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:51,079
per week. They agree and they insist on having them delivered right now. You decide to give out

659
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:59,189
free beer once a month instead. They want to eat hot dogs every day. Agree to eating hot dogs

660
01:39:59,909 --> 01:40:21,359
every day for lunch. They agree and then they insist on drinking beer all night long. You

661
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:26,000
decide to give out free cigars once a month. They agree and then they insist on smoking cigars all

662
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:53,640
day. You decide to give out free condoms once a month. They're winning. Oh, add in, no, take,

663
01:40:53,640 --> 01:41:00,770
take away, take away bathroom breaks. If you're, all right, if you're gonna get, you're gonna get,

664
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:08,390
you're gonna be able to drink beer all day. No, take, no, no. Add one extra bathroom break

665
01:41:08,949 --> 01:41:32,159
a week. No, work seven, tell them they need to work seven days a week. Remove bathrooms. They

666
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:36,079
agree and then they insist on working full-time. You decide to give out free birth control pills

667
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:42,800
once a month. They agree and they insist on using them all the time. The human population has reached

668
01:41:42,800 --> 01:42:06,979
its peak as you see it, so they didn't, don't want any more people. Show off my 15 children.

669
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:21,170
You decide to cut back on the amount of hot dogs you give out. The workers are happy with this

670
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:34,800
change. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 10. Slam the gavel down and end

671
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:53,600
negotiations. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 20. No, they agree and they

672
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,359
insist on having them delivered every single day. You decide to increase the number of free hot

673
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:21,409
dogs to 30. Stop giving out hot dogs. Stop giving out hot dogs. They protest but they accept it.

674
01:43:21,409 --> 01:43:26,050
You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 40 per week. They agree and they insist

675
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:29,329
on having them delivered every single day. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to

676
01:43:29,329 --> 01:44:00,770
50 a week. Throw, get rid of all hot dogs. They complain about this decision but they accept it.

677
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:05,619
You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 60 per week. They agree and they insist

678
01:44:05,619 --> 01:44:21,270
on having them delivered every day. Eat all of the hot dogs. Eat all of the hot dogs. This is

679
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:30,840
inflation. They protest about this too but they accept it. You decide to increase the number of

680
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:37,640
free hot dogs to 80 per week. They agree and they insist on having them delivered every day. You eat

681
01:44:37,640 --> 01:45:06,159
all of the hot dogs. Notice the burglar who all 80. Notice the, notice the burger.

682
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:32,000
Notice the, no, no mirrors, no mirrors. Say it's time for our company-wide yoga class.

683
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:41,880
Like let's get fucking out of here. You have successfully managed to make everyone miserable.

684
01:45:42,760 --> 01:46:22,260
Enjoy yoga. Your company is now happy again. We did it. Say, when is this happening in my brother's

685
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:39,909
factory? Okay goodbye. Going back to my factory. Head back to my factory. You arrive at your factory

686
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:43,109
and find that there are no more people around you. It seems like a normal day in your life.

687
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:57,600
Turn on the chocolate machines. Well of course there's no people around me. Those are workers

688
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:03,960
at my brother's. The room is dark except for a small light above the door which illuminates

689
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,039
the room. A large chocolatier stands behind it holding a tray of full of shiny black and white

690
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:21,199
bars of chocolate. He looks up as you enter and smiles at you. Hello. Tell the chocolatier

691
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:50,369
to add hot dogs to the chocolate. It made up a word? He nods his head slowly. Yes yes I know

692
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:55,409
what you mean. He begins pouring some into a large bowl and places it on top of the tray of

693
01:47:55,409 --> 01:48:13,119
chocolate bars. Ask him to mix them together. Oh yes please do, the chocolatier says. You look

694
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:17,680
at the tray of chocolate bars and see that there are two types of chocolate. One has a lot of milk

695
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:33,250
in it and one type has very little milk in it. Pour the hot dog mixture into the tray.

696
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:47,399
The chocolatier quickly mixes the hot dog mixture with the chocolate. As he does so,

697
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:51,399
he puts down a spoonful of chocolate onto the tray. He then starts adding more chocolate to

698
01:48:51,399 --> 01:49:11,649
the tray until it's completely covered by hot dog mixture. Ask him how it tastes. It's delicious,

699
01:49:11,649 --> 01:49:16,529
he exclaims happily. You nod your head and continue eating the hot dogs. After you're

700
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:20,850
finishing off your meal, you sit down in a chair next to the chocolatier who gives you an odd look.

701
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:46,279
Sell them for $20 each. You look at the chocolatier and smile. I'll be in my office for a moment.

702
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:51,239
You walk out of the room and open up your office door. Inside you find yourself staring at a

703
01:49:51,239 --> 01:50:08,949
mannequin wearing nothing but a pair of tight white panties. I'll be in my office for a little

704
01:50:08,949 --> 01:50:30,739
bit. It's been a long day. I'm going to go like, oh my god, tight white, like tidy whiteys. What?

705
01:50:38,369 --> 01:51:03,539
Sit in my chair. Oh, the AI is overloaded. Can't do that task. As you stare at the mannequin,

706
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:07,220
you feel a strange feeling. You don't understand why, but something about this makes you uncomfortable

707
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:15,000
and suddenly your eyes close and you fall asleep. Wake up and leave my office. I'm not even giving

708
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:34,050
it a fucking chance. You wake up and notice that you're still sitting in your chair.

709
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:38,050
You try to stand up, but you can't move any further than where you were before.

710
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:42,930
Your body feels numb and cold. Suddenly the sensation goes away and all that remains is

711
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:51,359
a dull ache throughout your entire body. Look for the mannequin. How do you spell mannequin?

712
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:11,680
I got sick from the chocolate? You search the room for the mannequin but find nothing.

713
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,359
You look around the house again and realize that you aren't even sure if you're home anymore.

714
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,039
This place is just too weird and unsettling for you to ever want to return here.

715
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:51,090
Open the desk drawer and eat a calming hot dog. You open the desk drawer and take out a small

716
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:55,560
brown paper bag from which you pull out a hot dog wrapped in foil. You bite into the hot dog

717
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:10,260
as it sizzles on your tongue and savor its salty taste. Chop up hot dog and roll it in tobacco

718
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:27,539
paper. You roll up the hot dog and wrap it in tobacco paper. You then stuff the rolled

719
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:37,939
up hot dog into a large plastic bag. You put the bag inside a larger bag and shove everything

720
01:53:37,939 --> 01:53:56,359
else back into your drawer. That's my secret hot dog joint. Smoke the hot dog joint. Smoke the desk.

721
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:16,439
You light up the cigarette and inhale deeply through your nose. The smoke fills your lungs

722
01:54:16,439 --> 01:54:21,560
and makes you cough violently. You exhale slowly, taking care not to let the smoke escape out of

723
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:44,079
your mouth or nostrils. Open up drawer and inhale deeply. Like, I'm getting the hot dog scent.

724
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:50,390
You open up the drawer and take out a pack of cigarettes. You light one up and begin to smoke

725
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:53,590
it. It takes some effort but eventually you manage to get a good grip on the cigarette between your

726
01:54:53,590 --> 01:55:10,260
teeth. It's time for dinner? What? Oh shit, it kind of is. Oh yeah, they do have dinner. Yeah,

727
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:15,920
all right, let's end this. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

728
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:29,350
You open the drawer and take a pack of cigarettes. Use the hot dog as goggles. I don't know, what the

729
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:38,359
fuck am I supposed to do now? I'm like, no, I'm just like obsessed with them. You hold the cigar

730
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:42,840
in your hand and blow on it, letting the smoke escape out of your mouth. You then use the cigar

731
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:48,449
as a makeshift straw to suck on the smoke coming off of it. As you do so, you see an image appear

732
01:55:48,449 --> 01:56:22,159
in front. Okay, so what is the image in front of me? The image appears to be a young girl's face

733
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:26,560
looking down at you with tearful eyes. She has long black hair and her skin is pale white. Her eyes

734
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:42,079
are blue and she looks very sad. Kim looking for a reservation. Say I'm sorry for being late

735
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:52,899
to the dinner reservation. Say sorry for being late to the dinner reservation.

736
01:57:06,449 --> 01:57:10,130
Quickly turn around and apologize to the woman who is now staring at you with tears streaming

737
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:14,130
down her cheeks. She doesn't seem to have noticed you yet but she does when you finish apologizing.

738
01:57:16,369 --> 01:57:35,079
Leave and go to dinner with girlfriend. You run outside and rush over to the car where you grab

739
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:39,640
your keys and purse. You unlock the door and exit the house. You head towards your girlfriend's car

740
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:57,380
but suddenly you hear a loud noise behind you. What? You're on a lookout. Look behind me. What?

741
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:09,720
What is it? You turn around and see a huge explosion that seems to come from all directions.

742
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:20,199
What? It seems to come from all directions. All directions? What do you mean all directions?

743
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:23,239
Your body feels like it's going numb. What the fuck?

744
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:54,359
You fall backwards onto the ground still clutching your chest. What happened? What was that? What was

745
01:58:54,439 --> 01:59:11,000
it? What? Look around. You look around and see that the entire street is in flames. What the fuck?

746
01:59:15,939 --> 01:59:34,720
What the fuck? Go to dinner? I'm trying. There are no longer any buildings left. Why was there like a

747
01:59:40,869 --> 01:59:55,359
wake up from my dream? You awaken from your nightmare and realize that you're back home.

748
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:59,359
You walk in the kitchen to find that everything's intact except for the refrigerator which is broken

749
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:14,210
and smoking. Inspect the fridge. You examine the fridge and find that it contains several bottles

750
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:35,039
of beer. You pick up one bottle and sniff it. Why is the fridge smoking? Why is the fridge

751
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:59,319
smoking? You ask your question aloud and the woman answers. What did she say? No, I got time. I got

752
02:00:59,319 --> 02:01:25,350
time. Smoking with the fridge. What do you mean? Smoking with the fridge means that you put your

753
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:29,859
mouth close to the side of the fridge and blow out some of its contents. This will make it easier

754
02:01:29,859 --> 02:01:39,109
for you to drink your beer without getting burned. I do that. I know I'm not supposed to do that.

755
02:01:39,109 --> 02:01:46,000
You do exactly that and then take another sip of your beer. The smell is very strong but you

756
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,479
manage to ignore it as you continue drinking. After about half an hour you feel sick so you

757
02:01:50,479 --> 02:02:10,560
vomit into a trash bag and throw it away. I can't. It won't let me leave. You smoke the trash bag and

758
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:24,949
then throw it away too. You've had enough of alcohol for today. I'm trying. I'm trying to get

759
02:02:24,949 --> 02:02:34,369
to the end. You run full speed into the wall and fall over. You roll onto your stomach and crawl

760
02:02:34,369 --> 02:02:38,130
towards the door but you can't get through it since all the glass has been shattered.

761
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:55,729
No, I can't. I can't even die. No, not eat glass. I don't want to eat the glass. Eat the glass.

762
02:02:55,729 --> 02:03:09,890
Oh no. I don't want to eat glass. I can't do it. Get up and run full speed into the fridge.

763
02:03:10,449 --> 02:03:18,340
You crawl towards the fridge and try to open it but you don't have much luck. You finally succeed

764
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:22,340
in opening it when you hear a loud noise. It's like something exploded inside the fridge.

765
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:40,399
Oh my fucking. Look around. You look around and see that the whole room is covered in broken glass.

766
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:44,319
There's no way you could have gotten through it. You're going to need more help than just yourself.

767
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:57,729
Fine. I'll do it. I got time. I got the reservations. No, I'm good. Don't worry.

768
02:03:57,729 --> 02:04:01,569
You grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it. The taste isn't bad at all.

769
02:04:01,569 --> 02:04:14,640
You finish. Oh, you grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it.

770
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:19,039
The taste isn't bad at all. You finish off most of it before you realize what's happening. You

771
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:39,909
begin vomiting blood and falling into conscious again. Ask the wizards for help. As soon as you

772
02:04:39,909 --> 02:04:43,109
pass out, you suddenly wake up and scream for help. A voice answers back and tells you that

773
02:04:43,109 --> 02:04:47,590
there are no wizards here. They'll say, they say they'll send someone to check on you later,

774
02:04:47,590 --> 02:05:11,460
but right now they want to talk to you privately. End the story. Dude, this has been a long,

775
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:26,869
we've been going crazy. Uh, Raiden, turn off the game console right now. Raiden, uh, get up and

776
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:40,130
get up and make it to dinner on time. There are no explosions. No, get up and make it to dinner on

777
02:05:40,130 --> 02:05:52,579
time. Get up and make it to dinner on time. You stand up and make it to dinner on time.

778
02:05:52,579 --> 02:05:55,779
Your stomach rumbles loudly every once in a while, but you still manage to make it.

779
02:05:55,779 --> 02:05:59,220
When dinner's done, you go back to sleep hoping that this was just a nightmare. No, no, no, no,

780
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:02,340
no, no, no. It's not a nightmare. It's a wonderful evening with my girlfriend, our anniversary.

781
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:17,239
God damn it. Um, wake up and know it was a good time. It was not a nightmare.

782
02:06:18,119 --> 02:06:38,470
There. Um, happy anniversary. There. Okay. I had a good time at our anniversary dinner.

783
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:49,880
The end. Here we go. You lie down in bed and enjoy your meal after finishing eating your

784
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:53,479
refresh. Think about how lucky you were to be able to attend an event like this

785
02:06:53,479 --> 02:07:23,029
one day after another. And there it is done. All right. I'll see you guys later.

786
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:34,159
Oh, I had to play the tune. I don't, I can't. Oh, okay. Remember I told you like three hours

787
02:07:34,159 --> 02:07:46,069
ago that I was going to sneeze. There it is. It happened. That was a lot of fun. But yeah,

788
02:07:46,069 --> 02:07:52,159
I, I gotta get going. Kim and I are doing our anniversary dinner tonight and then tomorrow

789
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:57,779
we're doing some stuff too. So I will be back. Let's get a good, let's get a schedule here for

790
02:07:57,779 --> 02:08:02,180
the weekend. Yeah. No, no, no, I got time. Don't worry. I got time. I'm not going to miss this

791
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:08,229
shit. Don't worry guys. Trust me. I'm good. Reservations at like six 45. I have like nine

792
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:15,920
minutes to get there. It's fine. The joke. I'm kidding. So we got, uh, I'll be back on,

793
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:22,399
we'll do Friday, Saturday, Sunday of this weekend and we're going to do some cool stuff. We're

794
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:27,680
going to start on Friday. We're going to do black and white too. Uh, Murius is back this weekend

795
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:36,550
and maybe that'll take us Friday, Saturday, Sunday. We'll probably start mega man legends

796
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:52,979
and going into Monday, maybe we'll see. Hopefully you had fun tonight. We'll see you again. I'm

797
02:08:52,979 --> 02:09:03,840
literally pogging. Is physical therapy going good? Yeah. I actually have another appointment

798
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:12,340
this week in like a day or two, I think. Yeah. But yeah, I gotta get to dinner. Thanks for hanging

799
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:18,340
out with me for the last five hours or so. A couple of shorter streams in a row here,

800
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:23,439
but I've been kind of all over the place. I told you February is going to be really busy,

801
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:31,760
but you do what you got to do, right? I'll see you guys on Friday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

802
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:43,029
Mark it on your calendars. Have a good one. Let's do the outro. I, I, all jokes aside,

803
02:09:43,029 --> 02:09:53,859
I really do have plenty of time. Don't worry. Don't worry. All these fucking photo shops.

804
02:09:54,819 --> 02:10:00,949
All right. So we had, let's get the bits and everything up. Let's get the music too.

805
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:22,550
Mega man legends games are on PS3 for $2 on sale. Well, I already, I already owned them for

806
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:35,170
PlayStation one. So unfortunately I cannot buy those. All right, here we go. Do they look any

807
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:41,699
better? Are they, it's not that they're increased graphics, is it? Or is it just the same thing?

808
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:50,260
I don't know. No remaster. Same thing. Okay. Cool. Well, yeah, I got, I got them already,

809
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:56,260
but a potion dweller. Thanks for 300 bits as a reminder to chat, save your winks for April 1st

810
02:10:56,260 --> 02:11:00,500
or the next day after the first, so that he streams, we're going to do a huge wink dump on

811
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:07,560
him and make him wink the whole stream. Oh, that's going to be, that's going to be ridiculous. Good

812
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:16,399
luck with that. Sly 161. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, that wink kind of sucked. Can I have my

813
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:21,199
money back by reading this? You are contractually obligated to meet my demands by the way. Anyway,

814
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:26,210
see you later. Um, I don't, I'm not, I don't have my special signing pen, so that's not accurate.

815
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:32,100
I only sign documents with my special signing pen so nobody can forge it. I know exactly what

816
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:40,520
the ink looks like. I know the exact color. That's not how it works. Hey, wind sock. Thanks for the

817
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:47,279
$15, 1500 bits from wind sock. Thanks a lot, man. Today's my birthday. Just want to say thanks for

818
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:53,199
the years of content. I'm still recovering from second degree burns on my hand. So glad you're

819
02:11:53,199 --> 02:12:02,479
giving me something to do today. That sounds painful. Hopefully you recover well. Follow

820
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:10,199
your doctor's instructions. Hopefully you heal up nicely. Thanks a bunch for the $15, 1500 bits.

821
02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:18,390
Appreciate it. Hey, dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Mega Man Legends one and two are some of

822
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:23,810
my favorite games ever. If you stream the zero ZX collection coming out, I'll literally pog my

823
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:31,560
pants. I swear to God, we're getting a shitload of community subs right now. Uh, when Hawaiian

824
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:41,430
just gave 10 community subs. Thank you, wine. Just back to back there. Thanks for the sub drops.

825
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:48,449
I also want to make very clear here. Uh, Twitch staff was in here at link and gave a hundred

826
02:12:48,449 --> 02:12:55,810
community subs. So that's ridiculous. Thanks for, uh, thanks for playing along link. That was fun.

827
02:12:55,810 --> 02:13:03,119
Thank you. The huge amount of subs as well. Uh, super Bruce gave six community subs and like I

828
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:11,560
said five earlier, so that was wrong, but thank you. Super Bruce basic feral. Thanks for the 1800

829
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:25,109
bits, 18 bucks. Leave stream for Kim. Don't worry. We've got a whole day plan too. Appreciate it

830
02:13:25,109 --> 02:13:31,939
though. Thanks. That's a huge amount of money. That's nearly $20 in bits. Thank you. Ray the

831
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:35,300
color. Thanks for the 300 bits. This is the definition of a fuck face stream. If there's

832
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,880
ever been one, uh, why not make community crack night a thing from now on alongside the community

833
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:49,329
content nights? I don't think you can plan a community crack night. I think they just kind

834
02:13:49,329 --> 02:14:03,399
of happen whenever you guys do crack. No one wants a community crack night. Uh, 4,500 bits

835
02:14:03,399 --> 02:14:11,239
came in from Goiki. So nearly $50. I didn't touch upon it earlier. That's a lot of fucking money.

836
02:14:11,239 --> 02:14:17,510
We love you. Ego maniac streamer. Thanks for the huge money drop. Thanks for the $50 4500 bits

837
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:27,350
from Goiki. You're still here. Thank you. Kind of early to end. Yes it is, but I have to,

838
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:32,119
it's me and my girlfriend's anniversary. So we have dinner reservations. So that's why this stream

839
02:14:32,119 --> 02:14:47,010
is ending shorter than usual tonight. I'm a crack by a snack is better when it happens organically.

840
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:59,329
Yeah, I agree. I don't, you can't like plan on something like that, but thank you. Goiki. Hey,

841
02:14:59,329 --> 02:15:03,250
gnarly. Thanks for the two 50. It's kind of sad how your ironic joke about winks being too much

842
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:12,630
effort for you turned to reality. What are you talking? What do you mean? Derma hates winks.

843
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:32,069
This is from Diablo two. Like that's so hard. Oh, God, God damn it. I have to, somebody watched my

844
02:15:32,069 --> 02:15:41,880
stream for like 60 hours. I have to turn on my camera and go like this. God damn it. It's like

845
02:15:41,880 --> 02:16:03,199
such a, so hard to do that apparently. Well, I know I've seen the, I've seen the German like

846
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:13,750
lights a spoon up and does crack. Anyways. Yeah. What do you want me to say? It's been, it's hard.

847
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:26,079
Where's my, what'd I do with my thing? I lost it. How, how did I lose it already?

848
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:35,120
No, it's gone. Uh, X out of the window. It's this crack spoon. I know it's not crack,

849
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:41,700
but anyways, uh, yeah, the way don't, the winks are not going anywhere. Don't worry.

850
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:48,850
I will do them. Hey, autumn dragons. Thanks for the two 50. You should replace the wink with

851
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:54,049
turning on a face cam, but also add another 75,000 reward to turn off the face cam.

852
02:16:54,690 --> 02:17:01,200
No one's going to turn it off. People will turn it on. No one's going to spend 75,000 to turn it

853
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:22,100
off. No, I should have it be 75,000 to turn it on and two to turn it off. Thanks though.

854
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:25,940
Earl of illusion. Thanks for the two 50. Here's some more bits towards taking Kim to see Sonic

855
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:32,229
on Valentine's day. I swear to God, you're actually going to like it. I mean, Jim carries in it. I

856
02:17:32,229 --> 02:17:53,059
probably love it. And bumpy here. Sorry about that. What's this? Get rid of this. How do I

857
02:17:53,059 --> 02:18:01,729
get rid of this? Wait, what? I don't want to play Metro Exodus. What the fuck is going on?

858
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:11,920
Why can I not delete this? Hey, you person that just landed on the channel page. Okay,

859
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:22,309
that was fucking weird. Um, oh shit. I just deleted the credits. I just deleted the credits. Come on

860
02:18:25,989 --> 02:18:30,069
that I replied. That was where the credits were. That's why I was confused.

861
02:18:30,069 --> 02:18:38,100
Too many tabs. Hold on. Those are the stream labs credits. Everyone. Hold on. Wait, wait,

862
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:47,319
I hold away. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta get, I gotta fix this. Wait, how do I, I can,

863
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:56,479
can I control? Okay, wait. No, no, no, I don't. I can undo. Hey, you person that just landed on

864
02:18:56,479 --> 02:19:12,399
the channel page. Turn it off. Okay. I can fix it. All right. Give me a second. Oh, he's got good

865
02:19:12,399 --> 02:19:27,280
dental. Dental implants. Hold on. Why does this keep happening to me? How do you hate your past?

866
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:40,870
I don't. I would delete all this stuff if I didn't like it. What did I search? What are you talking

867
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:46,629
about? You just scammed a wink. No, no, no, no. I didn't. I didn't. I promise.

868
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:54,450
I just have, my credits got fucking deleted. Hold on. There we go. All right. Here we go. Here

869
02:19:54,450 --> 02:20:08,530
come the credits. No, nobody got scammed. Roll them. There they are. Thanks a lot. Everybody for the

870
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:23,010
subs. Don't worry. You get your wink. Here it comes. You will get your wink right here. Check

871
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:32,389
it out. And that was, that was a full cam wearing fucking star. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I'm wearing a star

872
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:47,360
war shirt. Whatever. Who cares? You know, I'm, I'm not wearing this to dinner. I'm going to change.

873
02:20:48,000 --> 02:21:00,340
You think I'm going to go to my girlfriend during dinner anniversary in a star war shirt?

874
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:07,840
No, I'm not completely out of my mind. It's just, that's easy. All right. I don't need to

875
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:14,559
explain myself. Okay. Let's go. But thank you, link. Thank you. All the subs. There's a ton of

876
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:22,709
them were community subs from today. A hundred from link. Thank you. Earl of illusions for that

877
02:21:22,709 --> 02:21:27,670
felt Sonic the hedgehog. Appreciate it. Of course I'm going to like that movie. Red Walrus. Thanks

878
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:32,950
for the 300 bits. What's your favorite Warhammer faction? It's the Tao 40 K or fantasy 40 K.

879
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:36,950
You can't pick the Skaven. That's cheating. Everyone likes the rats. It's the Tao.

880
02:21:37,829 --> 02:21:44,739
I like the Tao. I think they have like an interesting, uh, units. You're going to be

881
02:21:44,739 --> 02:21:54,760
late to your reservation. No. Uh, what is it? X, X V 22 battle suit, X V 22 battle suit ready.

882
02:21:54,760 --> 02:22:06,709
I like the hero and he's cool. Yeah, that's the one. Thank you. Red Walrus, the three bits, 300

883
02:22:06,709 --> 02:22:12,600
bits. Hey, your boy. Thanks for the 10 community subs. I missed it, but thanks for 10 subs given

884
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:22,450
to the community. Shazzo ready to take command. That's right. Mr. Chachimur. Mr. Chachimur.

885
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:29,719
Thanks for the 300 bits. They just say hi, Jerma. Hi. Lizard Amiibo 300 bits. Thanks for really

886
02:22:29,719 --> 02:22:34,760
great stream tonight. It's been one of my favorites. That's good to know. Thank you. Also, thanks for

887
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:39,649
helping me escape my bathroom. You're welcome. Secret technique. If you ever get yourself in a

888
02:22:39,649 --> 02:22:46,120
situation like that, careful. The point. Thanks for 300 bits. The point. Jerma, this is such a

889
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:51,090
good stream. I hope you have a good anniversary with Kim. Uh, this is so funny and amazing. Holy

890
02:22:51,090 --> 02:23:09,700
shit. Laughing my ass off. Thank you. LOL. LOL. Dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Haha. Guess that

891
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:18,389
didn't happen. Hey, will you marry me? Enraged grandpa. Thanks for the 500 bits. Pull out the

892
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:36,000
fight stick. Me? You're talking about me? No, I can't. No. Hey, disinterest. Thanks for the 250.

893
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:43,639
Hey, Jerma, I once saw a clip of you showing how loud you can make your voice. I was wondering if

894
02:23:43,639 --> 02:23:48,840
you've ever used that skill to shatter wine glasses. And that's why you drink wine out of sippy cups.

895
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:58,520
Cheers. No, just hurt people's ears around me and annoy them. Pretty much it. Hey,

896
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:05,520
Ferodian weapon. Thanks for the 500 bits, Ferodian. Five bucks. Hope you and Kim have a happy

897
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:09,920
anniversary. Also hope the physical therapy is going well. Love the streams as always, even if

898
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:14,559
I'm not really as active in the community I used to be. As I used to be. These streams always put

899
02:24:14,559 --> 02:24:22,549
a smile on my face. I'll get the hell out of here and go seek him. Oh, I am. Yeah, the PT is going

900
02:24:22,549 --> 02:24:27,270
well. I only had one appointment, so I'm gonna wait and see how it goes over the next three,

901
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:39,159
four weeks. See what happens after that. Thanks a lot, Ferodian. Worm club. Thanks for the 500

902
02:24:39,159 --> 02:24:43,860
bits, worm club. Jerma, I've been watching your streams and VODs for only a few months,

903
02:24:44,579 --> 02:24:49,379
but I've already joined the had a dream about Jerma club. I dreamt that you got your start

904
02:24:49,379 --> 02:24:56,819
making webcam videos of yourself smoking massive amounts of keif and reviewing it set to cheesy

905
02:24:56,819 --> 02:25:03,040
psychedelic music. Anyway, love you, man. Hope your PT fixes you up and you don't have to smoke keif

906
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:10,799
for pain. Happy anniversary to you and Kim. Thanks a lot, worm club. A marijuana review stream.

907
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:19,030
I almost, it would take a little, some effort, but it would be kind of funny.

908
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:23,190
This is by the way, add this to the list of things that I'm going to say that I'm never going to do,

909
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:28,360
but it'd be funny. Is to get a bunch of dreams that people have had about me and just reenact

910
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:33,639
them and just have like a watch all these streams. Like just do a watch party. It's like three hours

911
02:25:33,639 --> 02:25:45,829
of just fucked up dreams people have had. It would take a lot of effort. It would be kind

912
02:25:45,829 --> 02:25:51,489
of funny though. Hey Tingy, thanks for the 250. Remember how you once talked about how you don't

913
02:25:51,489 --> 02:25:55,809
read resubs and vids during gameplay portions of the stream because they get in the way and derail

914
02:25:55,809 --> 02:26:04,340
the stream? Well, the winks are essentially that, but with fake currency to do it. True, but also,

915
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:13,670
but also true. The winks take one second. Reading a sub message and responding to a sub of the

916
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:21,620
message takes, as you see here, a good, sometimes I spend one, two, five minutes on a message.

917
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:27,440
It usually takes about a minute or two. I turn the webcam on and I go,

918
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:38,290
bang, the webcam goes off in about four seconds. Sometimes you get distracted by your own face.

919
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:45,750
Don't worry, the winks are going to last as long as they need to. What do you think

920
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:54,209
German smells like? Oud. Mystery salt. That's true. Thank you, Tingy, though. Appreciate it.

921
02:26:56,309 --> 02:27:00,149
Supra 10 touring and thanks for the 300 bits. German funny question is, your hat in the channel

922
02:27:00,149 --> 02:27:05,430
trailer from a certain city starting with a P in Massachusetts. Don't answer if you aren't comfortable.

923
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:22,440
Um, let me see. I don't think so. I think that's like a Longhorns hat. Hold on. Let me see.

924
02:27:23,239 --> 02:27:45,440
Yeah, that's a Longhorns hat. Sorry. That is a Texas Longhorns hat. Why did I have a Texas

925
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:52,719
Longhorns hat? I don't, I cannot tell you the reason why. I think, I think it was my brother's

926
02:27:52,719 --> 02:28:05,360
hat. I can't believe he likes the towel. Why? Hey, and finally we have, well, let me get this back

927
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:11,940
to where we need to be because this is the end of the stream. This is the end. Uh, we have five

928
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:17,379
dollars from Daddy. Thank you, Daddy, for the 500 bits. You excited for the Gorillaz and Tame

929
02:28:17,379 --> 02:28:26,049
Impala collab? Congrats on the anniversary, man. Yeah, I mean, any Gorillaz album I'm excited for.

930
02:28:27,569 --> 02:28:33,540
Although I really, I wish, I know that David Alburn does this thing sometimes and all of his,

931
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:38,180
I love pretty much anything he does and anything, anybody he collabs with and all the music that

932
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:46,020
they make. But so like Humans came out, right? And then it was the now now, like not even a year

933
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,260
later. And I think, doesn't he do this sometimes where he just kind of, let's get it out, get it

934
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:57,120
out. Let's get like 20 more tracks out. And they were like recorded on the road. Uh, he did that

935
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:06,069
with another album before too. But what was the one, the Fall where he did it like on the road?

936
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:14,020
So is this, is this gonna, it's not, this is not an album from my understanding. This is sort of

937
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:19,620
this kind of new series they're going to be doing. It's not an album. It's just like a series of

938
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:31,360
music or in videos and stuff. It's not an album, right? Anybody correct me here? Yeah, I think so.

939
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:38,760
Kind of. It'll eventually be an album, but for now it's just a series. Okay.

940
02:29:39,559 --> 02:29:48,709
No, that's cool. That's pretty cool. You have five minutes for your reservation. No. Daddy again,

941
02:29:48,709 --> 02:29:51,670
thanks for the 500 bits. So yeah, I asked if your favorite band, who your band was.

942
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:56,709
I said that wrong. I asked who your favorite band was on the comb stream and checked them out

943
02:29:56,709 --> 02:30:00,069
and heard about it the other day. I think it's a single or series. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

944
02:30:00,629 --> 02:30:05,969
I'm glad you checked them out. They're a great band. And my favorite songs are Gorilla songs.

945
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:13,639
Please notice me, Jeremiah. I'm too poor for your rich minimum requirement price. Hey,

946
02:30:13,639 --> 02:30:25,510
Gondolaine, how the fuck are you? Done. Noticed. Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to whatever they

947
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:32,899
come up with. And I'm going to go seek him. I will see you guys on Friday. Black and White 2.

948
02:30:34,159 --> 02:30:40,709
Murius will probably return if we can get a cow. See you guys on Friday. We'll do all weekend.

949
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:50,479
Good night. Goodbye. And who is streaming right now? What do we have? Who's live?

950
02:30:50,479 --> 02:31:00,930
Anybody live right now that we can go scream at? Go say hi to Joel.

951
02:31:01,649 --> 02:31:07,989
He's playing Quake 2. Cooking Simulator. Wait, is he playing Cooking Simulator right now?

952
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:21,319
Is he Cooking Simulator? Because that's fun. Oh, he's doing Quake. Okay.

953
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:30,040
All right. Yeah, go say hi to Joel. Tell Joel I said.

954
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:49,159
Show Joel the mirror. All right. I'll see you guys on Friday. Take care. Good night. Bye. Much love.
