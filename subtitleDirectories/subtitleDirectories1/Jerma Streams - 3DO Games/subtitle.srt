1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,740
Somebody in chat owes somebody $20. I gotta be right off the bat, gotta tell you right immediately.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:13,539
Somebody in chat bet somebody in chat, I think, somebody else, that I wasn't gonna be able to capture this.

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:19,449
And they thought this was gonna be a disaster stream where I could not cap the 3DO.

4
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:26,359
Well, I am sad to say to that person, we're ready to go. It's good, it looks great.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,160
It is working flawlessly, actually.

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,149
But today we're gonna do a 3DO. Welcome everybody, I'm excited for this. I've been waiting to do this for a long time.

7
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:50,060
I've owned this for almost a year. I've been collecting 3DO games in anticipation for this very moment today.

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:01:03,460
Do we need proof? I mean, okay, I can give you proof. I mean, I got a 3DO, crying out loud.

9
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,650
This is not on an emulator, this is actually... I'm gonna give a shout out here when there's a shitload of people here

10
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,049
because I wanna shout this company out because this thing works, it works very well, and I wanna shout out that company.

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:36,560
I've used a kind of old console converting upscaling hardware before, and this one is the best that I have personally used.

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:46,099
Wouldn't you like to know what it is? You'll find out once there's more than a thousand people here.

13
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:52,239
So I can show that I said to more than a thousand people that most amount of people were here.

14
00:01:52,239 --> 00:02:08,270
And I said it. No, it's a Retro Tink. The Retro Tink 2X Pro. The thing is amazing.

15
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,710
It was the easiest thing I've ever used in my life. I just plugged everything I needed to plug in in.

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,289
I downloaded some updated firmware, flashed it, and it's ready to use. And it looks way better than anything else I've ever used.

17
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:29,949
It's a Retro Tink. If you wanna use original hardware and you have an HDTV, get a Retro Tink 2X Pro.

18
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:40,669
And tell them Germa95 sent you. Who cares? No, it's actually really great. And you're gonna see what the picture looks like right now.

19
00:02:40,669 --> 00:03:00,020
Hey, look at that. Take a look at that. 3DO on original hardware. Somebody resident sleepered.

20
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:08,289
Whatever. This is big to me. This is a big deal for me. You haven't even shown it yet. Well, hold on. Let's restart this.

21
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:23,330
You haven't shown it yet. Look. Ow. Germa heart. Germa heart. It looks great. I know. It looks awesome.

22
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:38,580
Show us the console. Alright, hold on. Let me show you the console. I don't... whatever.

23
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:59,060
I had a fucking tank. I had a tube top on. Alright? I had a tube top on that went like this.

24
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:12,509
When you have to delay your audio and video on OBS, what happens is, it doesn't matter if fucking hours have passed.

25
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:19,620
A whole day could pass. If you didn't close OBS, it saves the last frame that you did.

26
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,189
And when you're setting shit up, sometimes you just don't even think about it. I'm just happy that you didn't see my dick.

27
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,389
Like that's... I'm just telling you a fact. I'm just happy that that's not what happened.

28
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh, yeah. That's fine. Look. I know. I'm fine. Alright. Anyways. What am I doing? I'm showing you... okay.

29
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:53,790
So watch. I'll show you for an example. An hour can go by and that's going to save there because I delayed the video.

30
00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:02,509
Was he wearing pants? Yes, I was. I remember wearing pants. Don't worry.

31
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:09,339
Okay. You know that photo of me playing TF2 with just like a bare chest? That just happened.

32
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:17,149
I don't care. I don't even care. Okay. I don't even care. Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care.

33
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,120
Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care. I would just be like, whatever. I don't even care.

34
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:38,370
Okay. Let's show this thing. Here's the whole setup. So what we have here, here is the...

35
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,089
Here is the... Well, that's a controller. There's the controller. The Panasonic 3DO controller.

36
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:50,110
What is that guy plugged into? There it is. The 3DO.

37
00:05:50,110 --> 00:06:06,259
The Panasonic FZ10 3DO. Connected to Game Retro Tank 2X Pro. Connected to my capture card.

38
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:17,439
Break it. I'm not going to break this thing. This thing's awesome. Why would I break it?

39
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,240
That was pre-recorded footage. Or even if that... Okay. Even if that was pre-recorded footage, who cares?

40
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,300
I own the console and it's plugged in. Does it really matter?

41
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,529
Do you think I went through all the trouble to plug in all this stuff and like set it all up just to take a video of it?

42
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,370
I mean, that's next level. I see where you're going. All right. Let's go.

43
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:44,110
One more stalling. Time for 3DO. Let's restart the program. I'm so excited.

44
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,420
Ladies and gentlemen, Rebel Assault Star Wars for the 3DO.

45
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:56,129
I am not seeing even nearly enough fucking hype right now. Hype it up, guys. Come on.

46
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:05,439
Actually, don't. I'd rather you be disappointed. Up pilots.

47
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:17,600
No, I want to get the... How do I get the... I want to get the intro. Just restart the system.

48
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,399
All right. Hold on. I'm going to restart the system. I'm going to restart the system.

49
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:28,029
I hope I don't break it. Don't break it. Okay. Ready?

50
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:36,500
Zach, is it going to break the hardware?

51
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:47,329
All right. Here we go. You ready? Nobody wanted to see the intro anyways.

52
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:57,329
That's the intro. It's pretty bad. It's loading. It's loading. It's loading. I can't wait. Here we go.

53
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:02,769
I'm so excited. I'm so excited for 3CVDO.

54
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:15,579
Did I even have to do that? I didn't even have to do that. I didn't... I really actually didn't even need to turn it off.

55
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:32,519
Will you... All right. Here we go. Quiet. Yes.

56
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:42,850
It is a period of civil war. Full spaceships striking from a hidden base have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

57
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:49,019
Who, under the command of Darth Vader, rule the galaxy with an iron fist.

58
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:55,019
That video is so good. 144p video file.

59
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:05,590
It's Luke. I know Luke. Many young unknown pilots have joined the Rebels in the hope they can restore freedom to the galaxy.

60
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:13,559
Either way, this whole thing was made in MS Paint. It probably was, if I'll be honest. It probably was.

61
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:32,250
3D movie maker, actually. We can talk all the shit that we want.

62
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:40,250
It actually looks pretty good, considering that it is an upscaled image of like 140 or like 240p or something.

63
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:47,029
It looks pretty damn good. It'll look a lot worse. Let's go.

64
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,200
All right. I'm done stalling. Let's play.

65
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:03,740
Smells pretty good.

66
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
We're a pile of crap.

67
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,629
Can I sneeze?

68
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:23,490
Attack com control. Request attack com control. Clearance granted. Is that you, kid?

69
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,490
Yeah.

70
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,490
Jack! Good to hear you.

71
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,490
So you're running your trials today. I wish I could be with you.

72
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,490
You shouldn't have any problems. Beggar's Canyon isn't half as tough as the rest we used to do.

73
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,490
So unsettling. I love it, though.

74
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,490
Good luck. Thanks.

75
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,840
All right. So in Rebels... I don't play this.

76
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,100
It's T-Rex. Oh, no. We're flying out of this canyon. Never mind.

77
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,690
I thought it was a T-Rex.

78
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,899
Should I steer clear that you have to fly?

79
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,210
All right. I'm actually flying.

80
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,899
Wow. This is awesome.

81
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,710
This definitely wasn't the trailer for the 3DO. There's no way it wasn't.

82
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,789
All right. It's a little tight. It's kind of hard to tell.

83
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,059
Working the canyon.

84
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:24,110
Let's go right.

85
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm a true hotshot, man.

86
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:37,590
I am.

87
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,389
Why would you bring the trainee here?

88
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:51,009
This doesn't seem very safe.

89
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,009
Okay, trainee.

90
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,500
You don't know how to fly planes yet, but just do this hard shit.

91
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm doing it.

92
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:06,059
That guy was trying to kill me.

93
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,059
This guy wants me dead.

94
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:21,059
All right. So far so good.

95
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:32,799
I...

96
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:41,629
Oh, it's too tight.

97
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:47,480
Good. Did it fly up with him?

98
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,279
I'm so excited. I can't wait to play.

99
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,279
There's 40 games. I have 40 3DO games. I'm so excited.

100
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:05,539
Shoot at the targets?

101
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait, what?

102
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I got him.

103
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
Wait, was that my friend?

104
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,379
Wait, did I shoot one of the good guys?

105
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:30,519
Oh, my God. Did I get to do the whole thing?

106
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,519
Okay.

107
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,139
I'm going to go left this time because I want it to be really easy.

108
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:45,450
That was friendly fire.

109
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm going left.

110
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,120
Forget about going right. No.

111
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
No, I don't want to be a hotshot. I just want to be a regular guy.

112
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
I went left.

113
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,419
My ship was tilting left. It's forcing me to go right.

114
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:13,460
It's okay. I got plenty of health.

115
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,149
Okay. Now this time, it's like a top-down view.

116
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,149
All right. Don't screw this up.

117
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,980
Is it actually a loser of choice?

118
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,350
It might be.

119
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:50,759
Stay with us.

120
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,759
What the fuck happened?

121
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,659
No, dude. That's not even what?

122
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,029
Stay tight. Follow and stay clear of the walls.

123
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,029
No, I don't want to.

124
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:08,919
It's very weird. I don't understand.

125
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,490
When do I get the lightsaber?

126
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,490
Do you get a lightsaber in this game?

127
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,490
You get a lightsaber, right?

128
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,490
You have to.

129
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,730
It's a Star Wars game.

130
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,730
I have to beat this.

131
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,899
Left.

132
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,759
Yeah.

133
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,759
Yeah.

134
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,759
I want as much health as possible.

135
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,669
I have to beat this.

136
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:44,700
This is harder than the other one.

137
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,929
Okay. Don't mess this up.

138
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,929
Shoot the drones.

139
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:54,769
Okay. I tried.

140
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,769
All right. I'm going to fucking sit up.

141
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:04,639
Watch the pillars.

142
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,840
Pillars.

143
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,049
Pillars.

144
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,049
Pillars.

145
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:15,049
Oh, shit.

146
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,289
Okay.

147
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:27,700
All right.

148
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,759
What's that? Is it?

149
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,340
What's a bug's fight?

150
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,899
Fuck. I ran into it.

151
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,360
Shit. I just crashed into it again.

152
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,980
Okay. It's hard to see.

153
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Fuck.

154
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,909
Okay. Just stay away from the shadows.

155
00:16:50,909 --> 00:17:00,789
Oh, fuck.

156
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,789
All right. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

157
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:10,380
No way.

158
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
All right. I can't lose my mind.

159
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,380
I cannot lose.

160
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,650
I'm just dead.

161
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,019
They're leaving me for dead.

162
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,890
Oh, I got game over.

163
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,890
All right. I'm going.

164
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,890
No. It's not even worth putting my name in.

165
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,829
That was just a warm up.

166
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:33,829
That was a warm up.

167
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:34,829
That was a warm up. Ready? I'm ready.

168
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:37,650
That was a warm up.

169
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,650
All right.

170
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,650
Somebody just go get the password for after this level if I can't do it.

171
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,170
That was a warm up.

172
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,559
What is this?

173
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,890
Rookie one is dialogue and text.

174
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,890
Volume difficulty is normal.

175
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,769
It's kind of cool.

176
00:17:54,769 --> 00:18:01,000
Everything's right here.

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,619
All right. Let's go.

178
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:21,440
Oh, this is so fun though.

179
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,440
It's just I love it.

180
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't care if I lose here a thousand times.

181
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,769
I'm holding a 3DO controller in my hand.

182
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:34,160
That's all I care about.

183
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:45,059
The song doesn't match.

184
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm crashing the bridge.

185
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,460
Okay. Don't mess it up.

186
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Just avoid the pillars and don't even who cares about shooting the drones.

187
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,470
All right. Go.

188
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:09,980
Who gives a shit about the Google Earth image that's underneath you?

189
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:18,900
Is that a shadow?

190
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:37,079
Watch out. Watch out.

191
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:43,250
Is this a wall?

192
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,670
Who cares?

193
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,670
Just let them go.

194
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,670
I've got no damage done to me.

195
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,730
It doesn't matter.

196
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,730
None of this matters.

197
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,730
Just live.

198
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,950
Where are they?

199
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,420
I did it.

200
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:15,309
I got a password.

201
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,190
Part one, path taken easy.

202
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,480
Password, boffin.

203
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,910
Yes.

204
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,910
Let's go.

205
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,910
Keep going.

206
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,920
After two, asteroid field training.

207
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Okay, one.

208
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,140
This is commit.

209
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,240
One standing by, commander.

210
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's get something straight.

211
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I don't like hot shots.

212
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,400
If you want to impress me, you won't stand a chance.

213
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm not like my twin brother.

214
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Dave, I don't like hot shots.

215
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
He likes them.

216
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Don't try to prove anything to me.

217
00:20:51,400 --> 00:21:06,170
Sick.

218
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,619
What happened?

219
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:17,609
Why?

220
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,609
You guys moving number bunchers?

221
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:20,609
What was it?

222
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,609
Math blasters?

223
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:36,099
Watch.

224
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,660
Watch.

225
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,279
Fine.

226
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,420
Shit.

227
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
There's a lot of them coming.

228
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Down?

229
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,289
All right.

230
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,289
We're good.

231
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,289
We're good.

232
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:53,289
We're good.

233
00:21:53,289 --> 00:22:03,099
We're fine.

234
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:04,339
We're fine.

235
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,339
Perfect.

236
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,339
Thanks, man.

237
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:10,980
Omega low.

238
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
Omega low.

239
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Erglick.

240
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,539
Erglick.

241
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,660
Yeah.

242
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
I know.

243
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
I know.

244
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
I know.

245
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Okay.

246
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
Cool.

247
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Good link.

248
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm busy.

249
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
I was expecting her head to spin around 360 degrees.

250
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Hard course.

251
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:53,220
Holy shit.

252
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
This is hard.

253
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
I'm sorry.

254
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,190
Okay.

255
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:10,420
I have to calm down.

256
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:28,809
How?

257
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:29,809
That was insane.

258
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:35,720
How did I not get any damage done?

259
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Am I regenerating health?

260
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
This is what it's like when you're in a dream.

261
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
That's what it looks like when you're flying around in a dream.

262
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,470
All right.

263
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:58,029
Now where's the lightsaber training?

264
00:23:58,029 --> 00:23:59,029
Password.

265
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:01,099
Leaning.

266
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:02,099
So now what?

267
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,470
Do I get on the ground fighting?

268
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:11,049
Okay.

269
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,049
It's a static shot.

270
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,220
Sure.

271
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Wasn't that funny?

272
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,859
My bit rate is really low right now.

273
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,099
Okay.

274
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,099
Okay.

275
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:29,700
Okay.

276
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Wait, is there an internet problem?

277
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,299
It's like, oh, no, no, no.

278
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,299
Right.

279
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,299
Right.

280
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,309
Right.

281
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:40,309
There's like fucking a thousand kilobytes of data on the screen right now.

282
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,309
I'll lower it.

283
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,309
It's a little up.

284
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,309
Vader.

285
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:44,309
Vader.

286
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,309
Within moments, our troops will board their ship.

287
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:46,309
We'll then have the stolen plans back in our possession and Princess Leia as well.

288
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:57,539
Excellent.

289
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,059
I shall oversee her interrogation personally.

290
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,750
Uh-oh.

291
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,750
Fake actor.

292
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,750
Okay.

293
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:41,839
I'm just waiting for a guy to turn the corner that's supposed to be your dad, but he doesn't

294
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,839
look like your dad at all.

295
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,839
He has a mustache on.

296
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,839
Your dad doesn't have a mustache, but it's your dad and your dream.

297
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,839
It's fucking weird.

298
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,839
I'm going to regret this.

299
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,980
This thing is safe.

300
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Battle station plans are not on board this ship and no transmissions were made.

301
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting.

302
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,059
No life forms were present.

303
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,059
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

304
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:02,839
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.

305
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,839
See to it personally, Commander.

306
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,839
Okay.

307
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,839
Darth Vader is dead in that chair.

308
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,839
Somebody's holding his mask from behind and doing a voice.

309
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,839
Oh, he's just sitting there.

310
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,019
Okay.

311
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,019
Uh-oh.

312
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,019
Emergency.

313
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,019
I took the animator a full three days to do that, by the way.

314
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,019
You just watched.

315
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,019
Lift it up.

316
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,019
Drink it.

317
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,019
Put it down.

318
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:17,019
It's a full day of work.

319
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,019
I'm ready.

320
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,019
Let's go.

321
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,019
Let's go.

322
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:21,019
Let's go.

323
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,019
Let's go.

324
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,019
Let's go.

325
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,019
Let's go.

326
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,019
Let's go.

327
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,019
Let's go.

328
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,220
Let's go.

329
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,940
Let's go.

330
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Let's go.

331
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Let's go.

332
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:46,390
Let's go.

333
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,390
Let's go.

334
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,390
Let's go.

335
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,390
Let's go.

336
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,390
Let's go.

337
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,390
Let's go.

338
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,390
Let's go.

339
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:58,690
Uh-oh.

340
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,690
Emergency.

341
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:07,900
I took the animator a full three days to do that, by the way.

342
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
You just watched.

343
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,210
Lift it up.

344
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,210
Drink it.

345
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,210
Put it down.

346
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,210
It's a full day of work.

347
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,210
I'm ready.

348
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:22,740
Let's go.

349
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Let's go.

350
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Let's go.

351
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:34,049
Seems a very enthusiastic.

352
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,049
We have to take out the command center.

353
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,049
Watch out.

354
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,049
There's a ton on the line.

355
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,049
Here we go.

356
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:42,490
Wait.

357
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,490
Wait.

358
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,329
Don't go that, uh, how do I?

359
00:27:46,329 --> 00:28:05,259
Star Fox? Um, sorry, Star Fox is shitty Star Wars. Can you rephrase that please? Cut his

360
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:26,019
mic. No, can we be, let's be real, Star Fox is Star Wars with animals. I love Star Fox,

361
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:31,019
it's like one of my favorite games, especially the one for 64. Star Fox 64 might be one of

362
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:40,109
the best games ever made. In fact it is, why would I even say it might be? I'm actually

363
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:56,400
doing pretty good. I can't wait to get, when does it, I gotta get to the lightsaber fight

364
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:10,740
with Darth Vader. You're one hit away from death. Don't distract me like that. How many

365
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:23,609
of these fucking things exist? Don't hit the wall, don't hit the wall. Alright, let's take

366
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:41,059
out the things on top. I did my work, can I do the other thing? There's nothing left.

367
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:47,460
This is fun. I am having a great time. I love this, I'm so happy right now. I feel like

368
00:29:47,460 --> 00:30:05,039
my son was just born. Is this what it feels like? Get it! No, I don't want to do another

369
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:26,400
cool Redditor soy boy. What? Because he's comparing the 3DO, playing it for the first

370
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,000
time with having a child be born. Alright, I'll give you that one. You can have that

371
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:45,740
one. Yeah, that's fine, you can have it. Kind of true, actually. Well, whatever. I don't

372
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:52,390
have a son, I don't know what it's like. I have to imagine something like this. Okay,

373
00:30:52,390 --> 00:31:14,869
please don't die. Don't die, just kill the thing. Don't crash into the wall. How do

374
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:39,539
I have to? Torpedo's armed. Shoot it! Shoot it there! Did I get it? Oh, I got it. Having

375
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:59,970
children is like playing Donkey Kong. We got more. I got to be careful with this controller.

376
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:14,039
Is he alright? Oh, he's not. I feel like this controller feels so delicate that I feel like

377
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,640
if I mash buttons and hold it tightly I'm going to mess it up. You know when you have

378
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,880
your friend over that's a big strong person and you give them the controller and you don't

379
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,240
like how hard they're pressing the buttons but you can't find the strength to say anything

380
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:35,099
about it? You can hear the like, and you're like, ah, fuck, I wish I could fucking be

381
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:56,710
like, dude, yes, don't fucking do that so hard. That's my shit. Okay, I got him. I did

382
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:35,369
it. Dermas of Beta. What? Yes, time to get on the ground. How many times have I said

383
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:49,490
yes in the first 30 minutes of this stream? Holy shit, I can kill AT-STs in one hit. I'm

384
00:33:49,490 --> 00:34:15,849
kind of low to the ground, don't you think? It's 18. Shit, alright, left side. Just do

385
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:33,119
a Jerma joke and crash. I can't. The game is on rails right now. I cannot crash. Give

386
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,980
a shitty blaster? I'm killing things in one hit. That's not shitty, that's really good.

387
00:34:38,980 --> 00:35:01,320
29. What's 30? 31. Oh, 32. Who's left? Am I single-handedly destroying everything? This

388
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:22,960
ain't like Galaga, right? I don't have to kill everything. Is it? 40? That's not real.

389
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:47,829
I got 44. Did I lose? I didn't lose, right? No, good, good, good. L-W-Y-L-L. Tony Hawk?

390
00:35:47,829 --> 00:36:13,079
I played Tony Hawk already. Oh, it's R2-D2. No, I played Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk Underground,

391
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,300
Tony Hawk 1. I did them all. If you think you're going to get anything good from me,

392
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:31,760
from Tony Hawk, no. You're going to have to teleport back to when I was 16. Don't do,

393
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:40,599
don't lose, don't lose. The new one. Wait, what do you mean? Didn't they just remaster the first

394
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:54,119
two? I don't even know what to drive to get away from this. God damn it. Okay. All right,

395
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:03,860
all right, all right. I'm fine, I'm fine. I have plenty of lives. How old is Jerma? 28.

396
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:21,699
And then in parentheses, plus seven. I am dodging. What are you talking about? I don't.

397
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:43,719
I'm going to get hit by the asteroid. Calm down, I'm fine. Don't hold it. Don't death grip this

398
00:37:43,719 --> 00:38:09,280
thing. Shit. Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it. Kill that guy,

399
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:23,219
kill him. Oh my God damn it. Play Doom for the 3DO. I got plenty of fucking video games. Don't

400
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:34,920
you worry. Don't just focus on dodging, nothing else. The amount of damage that the asteroids do

401
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:46,469
is pales in comparison to what? Down or left? Down or left or right? Right. How am I not dodging

402
00:38:46,469 --> 00:39:00,179
that? I very much am. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Which way? Which way? Which way? Up,

403
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:13,190
up, up, up, up, up, up. We're fine. Did I actually get hit by it? There's no way. Damn it. Okay,

404
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:21,409
don't get mad at the first game. You can't do that. They programmed this game on a toaster,

405
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:34,400
okay? You can't get mad at this. All right, if I lose another life, I'm just going to chip

406
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:44,710
chip away at change games. It was actually a microwave. When I get to zero, I'll do that.

407
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:55,909
I love Star Wars. Just hold on. How was that not a dodge? Run that back and tell me. I'm going all

408
00:39:55,909 --> 00:40:28,679
the way to the right. Just dodge everything. The fuck? How do you dodge in a game that's on rails?

409
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:42,280
It's all right. Since when did looking in another direction dodge your car? It's not like somebody's

410
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,840
driving straight at me and I go, oh shit. I lean my body to the left and not turn the wheel.

411
00:40:48,199 --> 00:41:14,079
I'm not going to do anything. Thank God. No, no, no, no. Dude, what? What are you talking about?

412
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,880
I was holding the controller all the way to the right and I still got hit by that one.

413
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:45,699
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. It's right. It's right. I remember. I've memorized

414
00:41:45,699 --> 00:42:01,010
the whole damn thing. I got to get the password for this one. Fuck you. Come on. All the way,

415
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,969
all the way, all the way. Don't hold down. Don't. All the way, all the way, all the way,

416
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:11,719
all the way. Which one is this one? Up? I don't know. I have no idea. Up? Left? Right? I don't

417
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:55,619
know. I can't even see them coming at you. I don't know. Down? Down, I think. Fuck. I'm okay. Can

418
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:01,650
this please end so I can get the password? Please. Don't fucking drive into me, dude. What are you

419
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,159
doing? Give me the password for the next one. Give me the password for this one. Give me the password,

420
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,079
password. Give me the password right now. Give me the password, password, password, password, password,

421
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,469
I don't care what is give you a password for that since it's wouldn't give you a password I want play lightsaber level

422
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:22,300

423
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,559
nice okay good perfect

424
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:37,630
Okay, so level one all right cool. I don't want a high score next game. Hold on I like this one

425
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:41,900
Let's go with a

426
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,099
Okay

427
00:43:46,099 --> 00:44:04,030
Mazak? Mazak. No. So why don't give him that he's gonna keep playing this. I like this one

428
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:10,900
I'm sorry. It's been it's been 30 minutes. I'm gonna go. I'm breaking the rule. It was it has to be at least 30 minutes

429
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:49,199
Yeah, but don't worry. I have it. I'm like it. Okay, mazic. Let's see what it does. Just watch the cutscenes

430
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:58,739
Wait, I'll put the next one in the wrong password. I might come back and play this one though

431
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:06,269
I actually like this one. I think there's more to see

432
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:11,329
next is

433
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:14,139
twisted the game show

434
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:32,170
You're gonna see the colored the colored bars thing wanting you you're gonna see it right now. All right. This next one

435
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,190
All I saw with this one is the box I just turned it on to make sure it worked

436
00:45:53,809 --> 00:46:13,800
I think this one's going to be insane. We go. These are collectible items. I'm not gonna

00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:04,889
It was everywhere. It was in every commercial every TV show

00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:54,309
This is child adult I'm not gonna do expert

That's it no more characters we're done throughout the game

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,070
I will refer to you by your contestant's name the object of twisted to great even really quite simple

00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:21,789
Well, Twink our lucky winner will receive a one-way trip out of this TV wasteland into whatever the hell's on the other side of the screen

481
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:28,230
I hear reality is just beautiful this time of year

Want that top left one

489
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,019
Use the cursor pad to assemble three complete faces

490
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,860
Recomplete, but whose turn is it?

491
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:34,969
Wait, what? Wait, is this right?

492

The first president throw out the game ball in a baseball game

830
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:12,579
Was the only manager to win the World Series in both the American and National Leagues that would be

831
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:17,859
Sparky Anderson, except I pressed the wrong button. I press see an action. I press see action

832
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:23,489
All right, let's move on this way more to see twisted. We'll be right back

833
01:41:23,489 --> 01:41:28,250
He's your last two vines. I used to be a wimp a loser that no woman wanted till I discovered hunk juice

834
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:34,409
It's unbelievable come on down we're giving away everything

835
01:41:34,569 --> 01:41:36,569
And now back to the game

836
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,340
wormington give it your best

837
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:53,529
It's challenge time what happened

838
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:07,500
Take the controller and secretly select a roll from the matrix

839
01:42:08,659 --> 01:42:09,859
Oh

840
01:42:09,859 --> 01:42:10,979
Okay

01:42:10,979 --> 01:42:16,100
Now wormington's wait a minute controller and selected. I don't want to look. Okay, we'll put it in another game

842
01:42:16,619 --> 01:42:26,359
I'm gonna next is I think wacky racers. It's a Japanese game. I have no idea

843
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:38,020
We're about to find out

844
01:42:40,539 --> 01:42:43,000
Interactive CD-ROM wacky races

845
01:42:43,819 --> 01:42:50,420
It's Japanese but the thing about the 3do from what I was told is the 3do is not region locked

846
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:56,199
So I believe I can play whatever I want in here, I'm pretty sure Japanese games work in here

847
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:22,420
Yeah, this is a TV show. Let's see what it does. I don't know if it's actually region lock you go. All right

848
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:27,699
Okay, there's 7,000 people here. One of you has to speak Japanese. So you'll be able to help us get through this

849
01:43:27,699 --> 01:43:37,359
Do you who does somebody has to write?

850
01:43:48,640 --> 01:44:13,899
The scariest thing I've seen probably all week future pirates incorporated present. Oh boy. I thought it was Japanese

851
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:22,779
You know, but wait a minute what?

852
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:29,289

853
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:41,359
Oh, it is Japanese

01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:59,550
It's just the cartoon but Japanese what do I do do I press start

855
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:16,659
This is the same technology that you guys do to get me to talk

856
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:29,960
All right, something's going on here there's a race and they're gonna they're gonna mess it up

Now pick a style

861
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:44,180
Remember once you pick something it's there forever. So make sure you're okay with it

862
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:51,800
This one has larger reach

863
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:54,500
You can smash your enemies from in front

864
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:07,829

913
01:54:56,529 --> 01:55:01,500
There's no space for another desk. This is the original box. Wait a minute. Is it behind here?

914
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:20,880
No, there ain't no second desk in here. What I don't understand. I can't do it. This is like paid DLC or something

Wacky races is not I repeat not a racing game shocked. Yes, me too

Why is it taking so long to say this? Okay. I want to do racist TV. I have to win one

923
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:15,989
This is my last try. I know exactly who I'm picking by the way

924
01:56:16,029 --> 01:56:28,289
You need to win the gambling to get a card. Are you serious?

925
01:56:28,289 --> 01:56:37,939
That would make sense

926
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,479
I love this one. It's super odd

927
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
I

928
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:08,159
Look it over there and I see a bunch of gems

929
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,960
Take a lot longer than I thought it was gonna be like

930
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:20,479
37 more games

To do that I the actual like seizure warning for real

It was Waluigi this is the universe that Waluigi

936
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,880
I

937
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:25,810
Want the driving part the real strategy here guys is to pick the same car every time and do it

938
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:27,810
100

939
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,680
You can't do it hard

940
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:48,810
Is that both of my guys? That was the two cars that I picked get the fuck out of here

941
01:58:50,529 --> 01:58:57,829
God give me a fucking break

942
01:58:57,829 --> 01:58:59,829

Touch it. Why did you touch it cavemen winning again? Yeah the dragon power. I

944
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:34,840
Yeah, yeah, I

945
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,300
Don't have to apologize for that. Tell him to

946
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:50,289
Am I ever gonna win? I don't think I'm ever gonna win. All right, I'm going with

947
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:53,050
Okay other plane

949
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:10,279
Okay, how about the two planes both planes both flying machines the helicopter in the plane?

950
02:00:11,079 --> 02:00:18,250

Shortcut all right. He's not gonna get the planes planes can fly

954
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:51,409
Why would you you have you bought would you go in there? You can fly you both went in there

955
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:59,050
Still get a guy in the race. There he is. Oh shit

956
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:09,220
And go I think that's a win. Come on

We're gonna pick the same two people again ryo bait. Thanks for the 10 subs. Thank you ryo bait

965
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:10,739

Okay

974
02:03:28,909 --> 02:03:34,880
Statistically speaking we should pick the caveman. It's a rerun episode

975
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,840
No, but now that you can't pick the caveman because now it's never gonna happen again

976
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:45,579
That's how illogical the world is I could happen ten times in a row and then when you pick it

977
02:03:45,739 --> 02:03:52,319
It it never happens ever again. I'm doing it

978
02:03:54,979 --> 02:04:01,930
Cavemen and cavemen and the and like the fosters home for imaginary friends crew

979
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:18,949
Come on

980
02:04:18,949 --> 02:04:26,840
We have cavemen as a backup will wait it will want the fosters home for imaginary friends crew to win

981
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:36,600
I see a plane in first place and it's pissing me off already

982
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:53,199
No, all right, it's okay. It's all right. We still have another guy

983
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:07,569
These cars are made out of shit

984
02:05:08,369 --> 02:05:11,289
What does the steering wheel come off so easily? Where's the airbag?

985
02:05:12,289 --> 02:05:28,989
Who's that thing the plane no somebody pass them somebody pass them

986
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:43,810
I have to win. I can't just not win one. This game was like 30 bucks. I'm not I have to win

987
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:49,939
How much was it actually never mind. It was nothing. It was all right. It was 15 bucks

988
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:01,140
And then we're gonna go Penelope piston

989
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:16,500
Oh

990
02:06:18,819 --> 02:06:25,890
Come on how many one two three four five six seven eight nine was a ten

991
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:30,250
Chance to win every single time. We've lost every single time right or a little bit more

992
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:56,810
Yeah, good not this time I think we're still good I don't think we're in there

993
02:07:01,449 --> 02:07:15,319
Our two characters are not in there

994
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:23,260
You're you're playing the Foster's home for imaginary friends music. That was me. That was me. That was me

995
02:07:23,859 --> 02:07:31,279
What they've won they don't win ever they don't there's never been an episode where they win

996
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:34,920
They've never won in a single fucking episode. This is ridiculous

997
02:07:35,439 --> 02:07:41,069
No, they don't win

998
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:44,130
They're a plot device to teach you lessons

999
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:53,319
Like brush your teeth and to always like be kind to your neighbor and shit. I'm doing it again

1000
02:07:53,680 --> 02:08:10,979
All right, we're going we'll go with a wild card here penis car

1001
02:08:11,859 --> 02:08:14,539
We have not seen a single penis car win

1002
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:24,380
We've seen almost every other person win it's been to that heaven we're gonna go with the odds of it's time

1003
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:41,000
No, this is different this is different

1004
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:48,539
Come on Buzz Lightyear take your giant dick and go forward

1005
02:08:48,539 --> 02:08:57,479
Oh

1006
02:09:01,649 --> 02:09:04,899
That's fine, that's not us that's not us

1007
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:12,960
Wait Penelope Piston passes everybody. Oh, wait, where's mine? No

1008
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:20,369
Don't do it you can't let Penelope

1009
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:26,979
Oh, do the brakes you hit the brakes you fucking idiot

1010
02:09:31,039 --> 02:09:37,000
The first place I just do that you could have won we just definitely gas

1011
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:44,000
And I'll be pissed in is a sure bet. I just keep not picking her

1012
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:51,670
Because he's a gentleman

1013
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,279
All right, and I'll be pissed in and

1014
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:07,979
We'll be in tweedle dumb up there. I have one twice each. I think it's time to go with the trend. I'm going okay

1015
02:10:21,949 --> 02:10:23,949
Why am I so engrossed in this

1016
02:10:33,229 --> 02:10:37,640
Game it

1017
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,359
Yeah, yeah, that means let's go or something, right

1018
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:03,670
Um, I

1019
02:11:04,069 --> 02:11:14,149
Excuse me. Did you that doesn't make any what the fuck just happened. There's anybody else on the course. Oh, it's a dream. Okay

1020
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:19,470
All right

1021
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:21,510
We got a guy in second place right here

1022
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:26,420
Do it

1023
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,340
Cross that finish line

1024
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:32,180
Do it. Why are you hitting the brakes again? It's a photo finish you want

1025
02:11:32,819 --> 02:11:35,119
That's a photo finish rollback

1026
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:40,630
There it is. Get over there

1027
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,039
If only his penis was a little longer

1028
02:12:01,399 --> 02:12:05,439
Okay, it's perfectly fine just the way it is but if it was a tiny bit longer

1029
02:12:12,619 --> 02:12:26,800
What's a wild card here who hasn't won you if the tank

02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:58,430
Kills people I understand like oh put a little bit of oil in the road. You're you're trying to kill all these people

1032
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:03,470
Wow get parried

1033
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:13,130
Now lumberjack doesn't win

1034
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:17,140
He's our guy

1035
02:13:17,539 --> 02:13:24,119
Nobody told me to pick the tank somebody actually said it in the chat and I didn't listen

1036
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:28,810
Nobody said it and I didn't listen. I was gonna do it too

1037
02:13:29,329 --> 02:13:41,300
Why is that just me?

1038
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:43,340
That character is me

1039
02:13:43,939 --> 02:13:46,689
That guy get crushed by a rock

1040
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:53,300
Really speaks to me on a spiritual level

1041
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:06,859
Elmo

1042
02:14:06,859 --> 02:14:15,680
Elmo and Penelope the lumberjack. I got it. I got lumberjack and Penelope

1043

Let chat vote. I

1045
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:26,260
Would do that. The only problem is I don't want to keep it on this screen for too long because it I just hit cancel

1046
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:29,909
Fuck, it's this is incredibly abrasive and horrible

1047
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:40,109
All right, we'll do it from here we'll do with click map but fuck that stupid thing

1048

It's pretty good. All right, we got Penelope and we got lumberjack

1052
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:19,670
Wait, this is the dream who wins the dream one. I forget

1053
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:40,739
Penelope did we actually win? I think this is a win Penelope wins this one. We're good. We're good

1054
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:53,579
Yeah, cuz we get forward and then he backs off right yep, this is it we win

1055
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:21,699
All right, I'm gonna do we'll do click maps, but please be aware that there's gonna be flashing horrible images on screen it sucks

1056
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:40,940
All right, where's my extensions? I'm gonna keep it on this screen for a second. Hold on

1057
02:16:46,290 --> 02:16:48,290
Did they change the extension page?

1058
02:16:50,850 --> 02:16:55,600
All right, I'm gonna do this because I really don't want to fucking have anybody puke

1059
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:04,860
We're gonna temporarily go like this. You know, who is down here

1060
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:10,100
Lower left is Buzz Lightyear lower right is lumberjack

You know where they are

1062
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:19,260
I'm gonna turn on the click maps in just a second. Let me make sure I can do that. I

1063
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:24,340
Have to win. Okay, you ready?

1064
02:17:24,899 --> 02:17:40,899
Go ahead and start clicking, you know where they are take a screenshot. Oh, yeah

1065
02:17:40,899 --> 02:17:44,100
I but here's the thing. I can't take a screenshot. This is a console

1066
02:17:44,579 --> 02:17:50,379
I'd have to take a screenshot of my monitor capturing the game. You got one

1067
02:17:50,899 --> 02:17:56,959
You guys are fucking on top of this like crazy. Holy shit. All right

1068
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:10,590

Go

1071
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:36,459
Not oh, that was kind of laggy. All right. It looks like cavemen

1072
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:39,739
They've been a number one so far

1073
02:18:39,739 --> 02:18:53,989
All right, cavemen is first click. Wait. No, that's exit. All right. No, forget that cavemen first

1074
02:18:58,909 --> 02:19:07,159
Who's second? No exit. We have to win one. I can't I'm not leaving till we win one

1075
02:19:14,309 --> 02:19:16,110
Penelope Piston

1076
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:24,110
got about 1200 clicks

1077
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:31,209
All right cavemen and Penelope. I would say those are pretty good choices. Those are safe choices

1078
02:19:31,729 --> 02:19:47,219
All right, we got Penelope and caveman. It's better win

1079
02:19:53,190 --> 02:20:02,159
You guys win first try I'm gonna be mad I wish Penelope I'm not gonna read that that's fine

1080
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:16,190
I hope you're right. You picked the two statistically biggest winners of the entire

1081
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:29,700
Oh shit, I missed a raid from RT game crowd

1082
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:34,180
Why did that not show up that didn't show up over here

1083
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:50,670
Wait, wait, do I do we win do we win an hour ago? That was a long time ago

1084
02:20:51,709 --> 02:20:53,950
You still here everybody. Hi

1085
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:56,670
Welcome to stream

1086
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:05,020
They all left omega low that's what happens in a raid you go to the other channel you spam 10 emotes and then you leave

1087
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:06,479
Oh

1088
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,040
You were right

1089
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:10,239
You guys were right. No, you weren't

1090
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:17,110
Oh

1091
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:39,469
Second place does not mean you won. Unfortunately try again. I can't take this and neither can I we have to win

1092
02:21:40,149 --> 02:21:43,030
We have to win one. I can't just not win

1093
02:21:43,969 --> 02:21:48,200
Even again, are you sure? I don't know if that's a good idea

1094
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:57,770
Please next Jerma games sucks. I actually I don't agree. Actually, I kind of like this

1095
02:21:58,129 --> 02:22:06,379
This is so basic and simple, but I don't know. It's kind of doing it for me. All right cavemen

1096
02:22:06,899 --> 02:22:13,280
Well

1097
02:22:13,559 --> 02:22:21,190
You can't do cavemen twice I can't double down on this bet

1098
02:22:30,379 --> 02:22:31,780
Okay

1099
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:34,979
Seeing it looks like it's gonna be tank

1100
02:22:35,379 --> 02:22:45,030
Okay, we're gonna I'll go take a choice

1101
02:22:45,629 --> 02:22:56,190
Penis card dumbasses. I hope that person's not right because I was gonna say penis car

1102
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:08,329
Cavemen and

1103
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:20,190
If you're the first screen you lose

1104
02:23:41,629 --> 02:23:45,379
It's us right tank did we cross first

1105
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:08,870
Can you even win a click, let's see

1106
02:24:09,389 --> 02:24:12,399
All right, there's two more

1107
02:24:13,079 --> 02:24:23,379
One more after this if you don't get it. Yes can't click right now. Hey, you got it. Hey man. Wait

1108
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:42,739
Okay, I think a tie means it's cavemen and buzz later. I don't think I even need to do it again. No, hold on

1109
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:47,860
All right, I was light year

1110
02:24:52,049 --> 02:24:54,049

You

1112
02:24:56,290 --> 02:25:00,389
Don't win you have to give a hundred subs, that's not fair considering I have no control over any of this

1113
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:11,530
Hey, Ben

1114
02:25:11,530 --> 02:25:12,649

You have to give a hundred subs if you lose. No, that's I'm not gonna pay

1117
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:41,500
I'm looking for $500 on the line. I've lost every single time. You want to put 500 bucks up. No

1118
02:25:41,979 --> 02:25:53,860

Go yeah go

1199
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:10,180
I

1200
02:37:10,219 --> 02:37:16,860
From fungal or I from yeet god fire from both air you guys are going absolutely crazy. Oh

1201
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:31,600
So what do you do on this is this a hidden object game?

1202
02:37:33,399 --> 02:37:51,280
We said eight possible racers two choices two out of eight or one fourth chance of winning or point two five or point

1203
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:53,440
seven five chance to fail

1204
02:37:53,559 --> 02:38:01,459
For example after 15 tries we can calculate the chance of losing every time by raising it to the end of tries

1205
02:38:01,940 --> 02:38:03,940
two point seven five

1206
02:38:05,059 --> 02:38:09,040
Up up arrow 15 equals point 14

1207
02:38:09,959 --> 02:38:15,719
In other words, there is a ninety eight point six percent chance of winning at least once after this many tries or germa sucks

1208
02:38:20,799 --> 02:38:24,059
Stop where are we?

1245
02:48:22,399 --> 02:48:27,219
Exclusive a lot of these are exclusive 3d. Oh, here's some history for you

Crystal dynamics Gex and the Gex character are gone crystal dynamics. I think they still make shit don't they?

1252
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:45,079
It all started so simply. I had just finished my usual morning routine of nude funkercise

1253
02:49:45,719 --> 02:49:52,000
Fired up the barka lounger grabbed a quick bite to eat and prepared to watch some serious, too

This doesn't belong on the disc it really doesn't

1261
02:50:57,809 --> 02:51:06,170
You have soiled the timelessness of this game by putting trailers for other games on the main menu. You just kind of have

1262
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:11,200
By the way, I own this

1306
02:57:17,329 --> 02:57:24,799

Wait, you can grab the edge. This is awesome. Yeah host

1318
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:15,090
I'm good at being other people in front of a camera. I'm very bad at being Jeremy in front of the camera

1319
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:22,340
You get I mean you give me a fucking ski mask and I'll be something. I'll be a weirdo. You know, I mean

1320
02:59:23,219 --> 02:59:29,819

02:59:38,989 --> 02:59:44,770
Shit, come on. Really? Oh checkpoints. Nothing. I'm gonna speedrun it. Come on

02:59:57,909 --> 03:00:07,200
Fuck I just got hit in the head by the knife bugleberry on the g4

1325
03:00:07,819 --> 03:00:12,299
Their ratings are gonna die. I

1326
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:27,909
Like this feature. This is really cool

1327
03:00:28,190 --> 03:00:30,500
Honest, right?

1328
03:00:34,610 --> 03:00:44,719
When you get a hundred of these you get an extra life

1329
03:00:44,959 --> 03:00:49,059
Is that our word?

1330
03:00:51,379 --> 03:00:55,420
Wait something up there. How do I get that? Is there a double jump or anything? Oh

1331
03:01:00,149 --> 03:01:03,510
You have to actually damage boost up here. What does this do?

1332
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:19,430
It's another life oh I just broke another life is what you're saying

1333
03:01:26,819 --> 03:01:28,819
Hold down while jumping to yeah, I know I know

1334
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:32,000
Try damage boost this

1335
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:41,059
Mom this is the greatest game of all time

1336
03:01:41,620 --> 03:01:48,159
Pretty good. It's the first time I've ever played it

1337
03:01:54,930 --> 03:01:56,930
Wacky racers was better

1338
03:01:57,010 --> 03:02:05,850
Well, okay, wacky. Wait wacky wacky. I can't say wacky racers was not a better video game, but

1339
03:02:06,530 --> 03:02:09,270
It was more it was more interesting to me

1340
03:02:09,809 --> 03:02:13,329
Does that make sense? Right? It's by far not a better game

1341
03:02:16,979 --> 03:02:19,659
Wacky racers is not a better game at all then get

1342
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:26,350
Stand in front of the exit. Okay. Yeah, there it is

1343
03:02:27,030 --> 03:02:28,670
Let it be level two and three

1344
03:02:28,670 --> 03:02:36,860
this is the kind of game that you would just keep your mouth open and just sit on the couch and play it and

1345
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:41,340
Did you just puke kill your TV man?

1346
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:47,809
Try to make like a Bart Simpson kind of character Bart Simpson and

1347
03:02:48,530 --> 03:02:57,309
Character and what was it for the lights in your house off?

Which TV should return on the one on the bottom one of the top the d-pad to choose remote

1349
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:16,590
Hey, that's not the one I turned on illusion of choice

1350
03:03:21,399 --> 03:03:25,040
Brave danger

1351
03:03:28,549 --> 03:03:32,520
Well that hurt

03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:44,790
Super bra

1354
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:47,909
L

1355
03:03:47,909 --> 03:03:51,190
TV man, it's Bart Simpson trying to be worse. That's Bart Simpson

1356
03:03:51,870 --> 03:03:55,399
All right. I just killed a guy that guy's huge. Who was that? What was that?

1357
03:03:56,079 --> 03:04:12,770
You get it

1358
03:04:13,090 --> 03:04:30,530
Casket wait work like link it does this must be power-ups

1359
03:04:31,290 --> 03:04:35,469
Well, I got the flower. That's good

03:04:38,010 --> 03:04:44,700
Why do you why do I get attacked by Duke Nukem? No, that's the slaughterhouse guy

1361
03:04:45,719 --> 03:04:48,559
Splatter house not slaughter house splatter house

1362
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:51,639
They make that game too reference

1363
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:11,920
References is all gecks is

1364
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:22,760

Give me that picture the checkpoint. Oh, okay. That's cute. That's a cute way to do that

1374
03:06:19,899 --> 03:06:37,000
Money this looks like a shield right the lag in the game if bosses and gets

1375
03:06:37,879 --> 03:07:01,500
Yes, there are I think I'm so confused. What's not is the health up top, right?

1376
03:07:02,020 --> 03:07:08,639
There are 100 bosses and gags

1377
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:15,590
Very good

1378
03:07:15,629 --> 03:07:17,149
Good job

1379
03:07:17,149 --> 03:07:19,149
That's a good job

1380
03:07:19,270 --> 03:07:24,319
platform is pretty fun the platform

1381
03:07:24,559 --> 03:07:28,149
No, I said was I'm just lying when they do that

1382
03:07:28,510 --> 03:07:35,920
It is though

1383
03:07:37,739 --> 03:07:45,040
Mr. Remote I did. Oh fuck. I missed a remote was I supposed to all right. Let me get the remote

1384
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:49,479
Where was it? What did I miss?

1385
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:57,069
I'm fucking so mad, but I can't show it to you. I can't show it to you. I'm so upset

1386
03:07:59,950 --> 03:08:10,879
I have to be very very careful. I don't wanna be screaming. It was right there, too. Sorry the checkpoints right there right here

1387
03:08:24,559 --> 03:08:32,850
Make it again. Yeah, good spread it spread it everywhere. I

1388
03:08:33,530 --> 03:08:44,870
Want you to show my grandkids that I was this remote

1389
03:08:58,299 --> 03:09:03,209
No, I'm just saying I don't does it does it I don't care it doesn't bother me

1390
03:09:04,010 --> 03:09:06,010
It's bothering him. No, it's not

1391
03:09:06,049 --> 03:09:09,879

Show my grant. Well, okay

1393
03:09:20,299 --> 03:09:22,299
There's nothing wrong with that photo

1394
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:27,590
Guys replace the background with me sitting at the beach or with a pool behind me

1395
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:30,280
What's wrong with that?

1396
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:43,510
Where's the remote? Where is it? Oh, I thought this is the top of this thing. Did I destroy it or did I get it?

1397
03:09:43,909 --> 03:10:24,469
Where'd it go? I get it. I got it, right? This place is weirder than 4th of July at Rick James place. It is bubsy

1398
03:10:25,829 --> 03:10:29,250
They saw bubsy and they were like wow that game sucks absolute asshole

1399
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:34,350
We can make a bubsy character that does the same thing that bubsy does but not have the game making one to throw up and

1400
03:10:34,350 --> 03:10:36,350
Punch yourself in the face a hundred times

1401
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Like the slime boys nice job

1402
03:10:50,389 --> 03:10:54,610
He thinks he's funny lol

1403
03:10:58,969 --> 03:11:05,370
What a find a videotape and your game will be saved when you beat the level he thinks he's funny

1404
03:11:09,209 --> 03:11:16,500
Me and one for me for me and one for me

1405
03:11:18,819 --> 03:11:21,719
Saying that you're freaking me out

1406
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:48,120
Immediately lost it that always sucks in Mario the worst sound to hear in Mario is

1407
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:19,870
Hey

1408
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:25,280
Nice the interlaced TV I

1409
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:41,819
Love this power-up. I don't eat anything but this that was sad. He said that in a crying voice

1410
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:44,420
We should be laughing at that. Oh

1411
03:12:47,739 --> 03:12:52,799
Shit, what have I done? Checkpoint right there an old windows cursor

1412
03:12:55,209 --> 03:12:57,209
It really is

1413
03:12:59,579 --> 03:13:13,629
Console sucks. No, it does not are you kidding me?

1414
03:13:14,309 --> 03:13:18,760
What did you what did you just do? What did you just say? I?

1415
03:13:19,979 --> 03:13:21,979
There's no way that I can't believe what you said

1416
03:13:22,780 --> 03:13:24,379
No way

1417
03:13:24,379 --> 03:13:34,620
It's called so sick. What are you talking about? It's called. So doesn't suck. What do you want about it? Who sent you?

1418
03:13:35,639 --> 03:13:40,629
It's a spike

1419
03:13:40,629 --> 03:13:46,959
On them

1420
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:50,309
That camera

1421
03:13:50,350 --> 03:13:52,959
How do I get that?

1422
03:13:52,959 --> 03:14:08,569
Radio fucking sucks. It doesn't know it does not how dare you say something like that

1423
03:14:09,370 --> 03:14:21,340
Can you imagine unironically?

1424
03:14:21,620 --> 03:14:25,940
Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot text text text text text text. You know, I mean

1425
03:14:38,850 --> 03:14:41,409
It still hit me up

1426
03:14:44,569 --> 03:14:48,600
Don't fall in that water

1427
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:08,250
I'm gonna give us another ten minutes. I like it, but I

1428
03:15:09,049 --> 03:15:13,450
Like it, but you know, it's one of those scenarios. I like it, but

1429
03:15:16,399 --> 03:15:26,389
Speed run on this game

1430
03:15:26,389 --> 03:15:44,879
We got that info. What are you minutes? I'm gonna say 30 minutes. It's only so fast. You can go through these levels

1431
03:15:44,879 --> 03:16:02,850
I want that full health careful. I don't want to mash on the controller. This thing's expensive

1432
03:16:03,850 --> 03:16:14,469
It's a 30-minute nap music's not good

1433
03:16:17,739 --> 03:16:36,950
Yeah, yeah, this could be better radio cost like $800 we have lunch no idea

1434
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:43,040
It's pretty expensive now

1435
03:16:44,600 --> 03:16:48,770
799 holy shit, that's insane

1436
03:16:50,090 --> 03:16:55,340
It was 699

1437
03:16:55,340 --> 03:17:00,969
What was their intention with 3do?

1438
03:17:01,290 --> 03:17:07,760
It wanted like a big home entertainment system, but

1439
03:17:08,680 --> 03:17:14,020
What eventually didn't they want to have like into the fully interactive movies on here and shit?

1440
03:17:16,809 --> 03:17:19,530
It was a goal with this radio they never achieved. What was it?

1441
03:17:31,209 --> 03:17:51,559
Come on fuck it's ten, right?

1442
03:17:58,030 --> 03:18:14,750
Well, I got a remote. Holy shit. I got a remote

1443
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:22,420
Oh

1444
03:18:22,420 --> 03:18:46,200
Let's end this level so I can get away. I'll get out of here. Okay. Okay. That was weird. Don't fall in

1445
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:53,500
dangerous very very dangerous

1446
03:18:54,139 --> 03:19:19,870
It's pretty good cat puke noises. I would say there's a remote right there, right? No, what is this tape?

1447
03:19:20,510 --> 03:19:37,340
That is wild

1448
03:19:38,299 --> 03:19:42,840
That's my favorite one. Oh, that's why that's wild stuff. That's Johnny Carson

1449
03:19:43,840 --> 03:19:56,799
Nice touch. I have a remote. I didn't get a remote. I thought I got one from the bonus round

1450
03:19:59,379 --> 03:20:01,739
We told you yeah, but I thought I

1451
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:07,270
Know I don't have to do this. Oh, come on. No

1452
03:20:09,190 --> 03:20:18,979
I'm gonna go very fast again. Get it. I care about any power-ups go

1453
03:20:19,379 --> 03:20:22,139
No, no, no, no, not next. Not next. Not yet. Not yet. Wait, wait

1454
03:20:22,139 --> 03:20:26,670
This is the flagship game of the entire console. Just let me get to the first possible. We just watch

1455
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:42,819
On ps1

1456

Fuck that. No, what are you talking about? So ps1?

1457
03:20:48,430 --> 03:20:56,260
Wait, this is it's not the flagship 3d. Oh game. I thought this was an exclusive 3d. Okay, this is fun PlayStation

1458
03:20:56,819 --> 03:21:04,950
It even runs better on the ps1

1459
03:21:15,889 --> 03:21:34,819
Come already back to where I was army men was the flagship

1460
03:21:36,379 --> 03:21:51,940
All right, that's not bad speed I don't want anyone to tell me that wasn't pretty good speech

More fun. It wasn't are you guys have a choice?

1475
03:24:26,959 --> 03:24:32,569
You can I need ones in the chat for original John Madden football

1476
03:24:40,329 --> 03:25:02,819
Need for speed it's too. Oh, I gotta save this one for last. It's gonna be so fun

1477
03:25:04,299 --> 03:25:07,629
I

03:25:07,629 --> 03:25:10,270

1479
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:28,809
Here comes the original need for speed X is cool. This is 3do

1480
03:25:37,379 --> 03:25:40,549
Classic console

1481
03:25:40,549 --> 03:25:51,090
Yeah, X enter the gecko was released in 1998 on the Gameboy color. Yeah, if you want to play the fucking fake version

1482
03:26:01,819 --> 03:26:17,969
That's okay guys in in 40 years. My gex copy will be worth like five grand. That's alright. No, it won't

1483
03:26:18,010 --> 03:26:27,100
I feel like I'm gonna think I love this game or I'm going to hate it. I think I'm gonna love it or hate it

1484
03:26:27,579 --> 03:26:46,540
Okay, I gotta tell you a MIDI track does not work on this footage

1485
03:26:47,059 --> 03:27:06,420
Doesn't sound very badass. Is this real footage though? I'm confused. It's a real footage game

1486
03:27:07,020 --> 03:27:08,739
You actually drive a car

1487
03:27:08,739 --> 03:27:15,840
It is real footage. Oh, yes

1488
03:27:16,440 --> 03:27:27,229
road and

1489
03:27:27,229 --> 03:27:43,940
Track presents the need for speed. Well, this is it whatever red blooded land love and land speed record want to be ever wanted

1490
03:27:44,459 --> 03:27:50,670
Free ticket in the rock of your dreams again one way to camera pointing down ride. You won't die looking up

1491
03:27:51,389 --> 03:27:53,950
Fasten your seatbelts

1492
03:27:54,030 --> 03:28:08,870
EA Canada

1493
03:28:08,870 --> 03:28:18,569
Still exist. How do I play?

1494
03:28:19,250 --> 03:28:31,260
Start I press start. Oh, it's waiting. Oh, look at how cool this guy is

1495
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:34,370
All right. What do I do?

1496
03:28:34,649 --> 03:28:36,649
What do these mean?

1497
03:28:36,690 --> 03:28:41,209
This is I this is scrapbook. I don't know what to do with this. Okay, I'm gonna click on him

1498
03:28:49,059 --> 03:28:50,180
Alright, this is how it works

1499
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:55,940
You can stroll this puppy out and go up against the best times or you can stick your ego on the chopping block and make

1500
03:28:55,940 --> 03:29:03,280
This an old-fashioned gunfight. What does that mean? Is that a race? Is that a fight? Is that like a test?

1501
03:29:03,280 --> 03:29:06,360
I'm taking is that what is that? What is that? What's he referring to?

1502
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:11,600
Did I just order something from a diner? I don't know what that was

1503
03:29:21,770 --> 03:29:23,819
I'm gonna click the road

1504
03:29:23,819 --> 03:29:26,000
city

1505
03:29:26,040 --> 03:29:31,479
11.8 miles from the tranquility of suburbia to the pandemonium of the urban jungle

1506
03:29:31,639 --> 03:29:36,520
This route opens up with gentle freeway and winds its way to the bowels of the city's underground

1507
03:29:36,520 --> 03:29:39,959
Oh deep poopoo. He said bowels snaking everywhere. That's quick

1508
03:29:39,959 --> 03:29:45,520
It overpasses concrete barriers long winding tunnels. It's all here for you, but watch out for traffic

1509
03:29:45,520 --> 03:29:48,760
It comes up real quick when you're at speeds these cars want to travel

1510
03:29:49,639 --> 03:29:52,200
187 miles. Why would you ever drive that fast on a regular street?

1511
03:29:52,840 --> 03:30:09,420
Let's go, it's like my car at Lamborghini Diablo VT next

1512
03:30:13,420 --> 03:30:21,500
All wheel drive helps with the VT's 492 brake horsepower to the ground up to 15% of the power is put through to the

1513
03:30:21,500 --> 03:30:26,020
Front wheels don't care about any of it. I don't care about any of these things low speed turns

1514
03:30:26,020 --> 03:30:29,739
But the rear drive care I don't care about the coordinates. I don't give a shit about how fast you go

1515
03:30:30,379 --> 03:30:38,920
I don't need the things to spread $252,000. All right, whatever. I don't you see your math problems. I get it

1516
03:30:38,920 --> 03:30:42,479
It's fast. You just could look me in the guy look me and go car goes very fast

1517
03:30:47,629 --> 03:30:52,579
Dangerous first is in trouble. This one is hydroplaning cool

1518
03:30:53,100 --> 03:31:19,430
Zero zero to sixty. Yeah, I love the zero to sixty shit who cares

1519
03:31:20,069 --> 03:31:29,280
Zero to sixty in ten seconds. Oh, were you in a school zone? You're under arrest

1520
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:38,389
When does zero to sixty mean anything helps put the VT's 492 brake horsepower to the ground up to 15

1521
03:31:38,430 --> 03:31:45,920
No, I don't want to watch the video again. Get me out of here when you are racing. You know, what are you gonna wear?

1522
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:47,040
You're racing this

1523
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:51,809
You're commuting to work with this thing. Good thing this thing goes zero to sixty

1524
03:31:52,309 --> 03:31:58,750
So I can be at the red light and step on the gas and then get a three hundred dollar speeding ticket

1525
03:31:59,149 --> 03:32:15,700
Yeah, that's pretty biased as people used to drive by my house at like 80 miles per hour

1526
03:32:15,700 --> 03:32:18,840
Yeah, I'm a little biased. How do I get away from this video?

1527
03:32:25,780 --> 03:32:37,260
Wait, what is this? These are other cars. Okay, I press B. Does B leave

1528
03:32:45,629 --> 03:32:47,629
The wrong side of the road he's gonna hurt somebody

1529
03:32:48,229 --> 03:33:08,170
He was swerving into the other lane. I'm gonna play the game. How do I play the game?

1530
03:33:08,329 --> 03:33:15,579
Is it not a game the small size of the Yarek? Okay, how do I go back?

1531
03:33:17,739 --> 03:33:20,299
select

1532
03:33:20,540 --> 03:33:29,000
Okay, we're good. Okay. This has a wheel on it. I'm assuming that means drive the car skill level. Sure

1533
03:33:29,600 --> 03:33:31,899
Audio this is the options menu

1534
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:36,059
Okay, this is the options menu

1535
03:33:36,420 --> 03:34:09,680
Just drive the car. Do I get to pick my car? How do you drive? We get a three two one

1536
03:34:10,200 --> 03:34:38,149
What's the three two one go? He has the parking brake on how do you turn the parking brake off? I'm in neutral

1537
03:34:38,149 --> 03:34:42,889
Oh, there we go. Got it

1538
03:34:42,889 --> 03:34:45,510
No, that's reverse

1539
03:34:45,549 --> 03:35:02,819
More than you bargained for too real for you. How are you? I'd keep this little episode quiet

1540
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:10,879
Why are we in the woods? Did we just murder somebody together? We just bury a body. I don't understand

1541
03:35:10,879 --> 03:35:12,879
I don't know. I'm gonna put my name in

1542
03:35:15,920 --> 03:35:19,309
Real height

1543
03:35:28,299 --> 03:35:43,180
There's no context to any of this am I lying on the ground in agony, okay, so let's get it into board

1544
03:35:43,340 --> 03:35:54,659
Do you have the manual? I don't think it matters. Okay. Here we go. Is it in drive put it into fucking drive

1545
03:35:54,659 --> 03:36:11,920
I don't know how I get up with it. I was a manual first gear. All right second gear

1546
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:40,159
Let's go third gear fourth gear fifth gear. Are these people not part of the race?

1547
03:36:40,739 --> 03:37:09,219
But it's odd. Is it auto shifting? There is there's that motherfucker right there in that red car. I think she's gonna get away

1548
03:37:09,459 --> 03:37:15,190
Nope

1549
03:37:15,190 --> 03:37:25,739
Get the police on me. Why is he still such a little blob? All right, here we go

1550
03:37:25,739 --> 03:37:28,260
I'm going like how fast we go like 500 miles per hour

1551
03:37:28,979 --> 03:37:51,459
Come on. Hurry up judging from the dashboard. This is like my grandfather's car. What are we even driving? Don't shift so soon

1552
03:37:51,459 --> 03:37:57,889
It's on auto. I'm not doing that shit. I got a ride in the breakdown lane

1553
03:37:57,889 --> 03:38:11,079
I got 160 miles per hour. This car doesn't go faster than a hundred and like 70 miles per hour

1554
03:38:11,079 --> 03:38:20,700
What is it the pass them? I passed them

1555
03:38:22,329 --> 03:38:41,040
Yet, how do you win the race he didn't say there was a beginning a middle or an end

1556
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:49,760
He just made fun of me and looked down at me three times. How do I win this? He's long gone

1557
03:38:49,760 --> 03:39:15,909
I blew by him a long time ago. Where's the end this level? There is no end how yes

1558
03:39:15,909 --> 03:39:25,420
There is that has to be you think that guy just gave up and was like, all right. Well, whatever. I'm done

1559
03:39:25,500 --> 03:39:38,989
You beat me. Why am I still going? Oh, that was I did it. I beat him

1560
03:39:43,030 --> 03:39:45,270
167 miles per hour top speed

1561
03:39:45,389 --> 03:40:08,370
Steal becoming one. Yeah, he waxed my ass. Congratulations waxed his ass. He was in the lead for like 15 straight minutes

1562
03:40:08,370 --> 03:40:10,829
Are you sure he didn't win?

1563
03:40:10,829 --> 03:40:12,829
replay highlight reel

1564
03:40:13,350 --> 03:40:37,020
Let's take a look at the highlight reel. It's just real time

1565
03:40:44,069 --> 03:40:46,069
Okay, it's

1566
03:40:46,069 --> 03:40:51,000
We can skip that part

1567
03:40:55,209 --> 03:41:23,059
Okay, just get out. What is it is the audio is too early. What do you mean like the in-game audios too early one guy?

1568
03:41:23,059 --> 03:41:36,600
Okay, I'm doing it again. I'm racing the same guy. I'm gonna do the same thing

1569
03:41:38,540 --> 03:42:02,270
different track

1570
03:42:09,159 --> 03:42:20,799
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. You've waited for me

1571
03:42:21,520 --> 03:42:31,760
Wax his ass. I'm gum. What do you think I'm trying to do?

1572
03:42:32,159 --> 03:42:54,840
Change the camera, but now it looks like an ugly video game this ticking sound

1573
03:42:54,840 --> 03:43:16,430
I don't get it. You go all the way up the police show up do anything last time. Yeah, I just hit the cop

1574
03:43:16,430 --> 03:43:57,850
That's exist cop car. I just hit him. Wow, you suck pull over should I where is

1575
03:44:04,360 --> 03:44:22,239
Speeding I look dumbfounded. Here's the goal

1576
03:44:22,239 --> 03:44:29,159
Can I catch up after getting a speeding ticket crash into him?

1577
03:44:29,159 --> 03:44:59,870
I must killed that guy the cars in neutral right now. No this am I gonna get two speeding tickets. All right, come on officer

1578
03:44:59,870 --> 03:45:02,809
I'm right here

1579
03:45:02,930 --> 03:45:22,750
The cars so I got out of one somebody pulled up another one and I'm still about to pass this guy

1580
03:45:22,909 --> 03:45:43,940
Shit, it's gonna be a photo finish. Please. Shit. Your horn is the biggest wuss horn. I've ever heard in my life

1581
03:45:44,260 --> 03:45:58,059
That's not intimidating at all, dude, that's does not say fuck you

1582
03:45:58,059 --> 03:46:17,100
Oh shit a cop's gonna get me game just didn't let me crash into okay, but I'll pull over what about him

1583
03:46:17,100 --> 03:46:33,149
Look at how fast he's going. Yeah, pull that guy over my pulling him over. I can't drive. I'm holding down the button

1584
03:46:33,510 --> 03:46:48,840
What's going on? Well, I do believe I got me my first UFO capture

1585
03:46:48,840 --> 03:47:08,889
You better start turning green real fast gizmo or the National Enquirer ain't gonna buy my story. What I got to I get two cars left

1586
03:47:11,950 --> 03:47:26,159
Assume the position fast boy. Now you're in the fast lane to the county jail. Did you walk up to the car with a shotgun?

1587
03:47:26,559 --> 03:47:37,370
Let's go

1588
03:47:37,370 --> 03:47:43,979
Okay, you want to talk about like 20 20 video cuts you put handcuffs on me, which takes about one second

1589
03:47:43,979 --> 03:47:50,559
They were probably probably 12 cuts and that three seconds to put on a pair of fucking handcuffs

1590
03:47:50,879 --> 03:48:12,569
How many times I have to beat this guy before we can is over you didn't win. All right, I'm gonna win

1591
03:48:14,370 --> 03:48:22,200
I need first-person driving. It helps. I want to see what happens if I beat him

1592
03:48:22,399 --> 03:49:03,690
Don't have to beat him. It's gonna be the fastest. You've ever seen somebody do this course stop pretending

1593
03:49:03,690 --> 03:49:11,850
It's no such thing as pretending while you're going 160 miles per hour. It's no nuance at 160

1594
03:49:11,850 --> 03:49:31,280
Don't pretend to go 160. I I cannot do that right now

1595
03:49:31,479 --> 03:49:54,010
The old strategy was just blow by the cup. I'm going too fast. I'm gonna catch up to me. Why doesn't he spin up?

1596
03:49:54,010 --> 03:50:01,610
Where's his?

1597
03:50:01,610 --> 03:50:10,670
Total cascading over on the side five out of ten link don't even bother

1598
03:50:10,670 --> 03:50:27,600
I got one guy said not to do it no more mess it around

1599
03:50:27,600 --> 03:50:37,139
I really don't want to do this again. I need to beat him three times. Sir. So don't even understand how that

1600
03:50:37,459 --> 03:51:15,889
He's gonna be right here. It's okay. Forget about the cop. I'm gonna blow right by him again and clear here

1601
03:51:15,889 --> 03:51:39,280
He is absolutely gonna buy him ride the breakdown lane. That's the best strategy so far this thing up to 160 easy easy

1602
03:51:39,280 --> 03:51:52,559
I'm coming up quick. See you later. All right, good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good on to the next chapter

1603
03:51:52,559 --> 03:52:24,879
I passed him on the inside. You know, it looked at chat. I looked at chat. All right, let's beat him again

1604
03:52:24,879 --> 03:52:33,959
I'll tell it look if it's if it's a five out of ten is average

1605
03:52:33,959 --> 03:52:42,309
Let's take a look you got the nerve to push the envelope man got some skill

1606
03:52:42,309 --> 03:53:00,270
That's that's what it takes. I'm hanging out with this guy in the woods every time. I mean that is a what do you want me to do?

1607
03:53:00,750 --> 03:53:09,879
round two

1608
03:53:09,879 --> 03:53:23,069
continue

1609
03:53:23,350 --> 03:53:27,479
Next game I got to beat this guy three times we change

1610
03:53:27,959 --> 03:53:44,450
So much faster than me off the gun. It's like it's the type type of car that he has

1611
03:53:44,450 --> 03:53:50,899
I'm so bad at you. I need to be driving in first person. I can't drive like this

1612
03:53:50,899 --> 03:54:00,829
I need the wheel to guide me you guys want to stay on the driving theme should I put in road rash?

1613
03:54:01,149 --> 03:54:22,299
We want something completely different and John bad. No, I think we're gonna hold on to John bad

1614
03:54:22,299 --> 03:55:09,059
There is no music. That's weird. Where's the music idiot move the radio on? I don't have a radio. Well by the cop

1615
03:55:09,180 --> 03:55:35,159
No, go go go go go quick quick quick quick. Go go go. He's right behind it go

1616
03:55:45,059 --> 03:56:06,750
120 oh you keeping up with me, dude. It's going 120 miles per hour right now. Where's this?

1617
03:56:07,510 --> 03:56:19,389
What why did I reach out? I gotta stop looking at that. Don't look at that every gun

1618
03:56:19,389 --> 03:56:28,440
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me. Don't look at chat again red guy coming up on this side

1619
03:56:28,440 --> 03:56:41,510
I got a Mario car. No, no don't let him go in front of me. No, he passed me. I'm gonna get in trouble

1620
03:56:41,510 --> 03:57:20,920
Oh, it's okay speeding ticket. Here's your reddit gold, sir. I'm gonna crash again if I'm not careful

1621
03:57:20,920 --> 03:57:42,180
I don't want to lose this it's so if the cop passes you that's how you get inside

1622
03:57:42,180 --> 03:58:03,719
Oh over the checkpoint very close very close. You pulled it off

1623
03:58:03,719 --> 03:58:10,579
The next thing you know, you're gonna be getting a sponsorship a race with the big boys all mama, but yeah, I hate this guy

1624
03:58:11,459 --> 03:58:16,959
Here we go. We got a new cutscene

1625
03:58:21,889 --> 03:58:24,059
first

1626
03:58:24,059 --> 03:58:30,409
speed

1627
03:58:30,409 --> 03:58:41,280
champion on the road and in your face what a drive what a

1628
03:58:41,879 --> 03:58:46,399
Driver all the scale all the thrill hard driving man. You blow me away

1629
03:58:46,760 --> 03:58:52,200
Yeah, the thrill the finish line is just the start man. You are bound for glory with your foot to the floor, baby

1630
03:58:52,200 --> 03:58:57,059
Wow, you need to drop the exposure on your webcam and put up the lighting in your room

1631
03:58:57,059 --> 03:58:58,819
That's why it looks like that guy

1632
03:58:58,860 --> 03:59:19,299
Okay, so do I just race him now what oh shit, okay, is that the whole game I

1633
03:59:19,979 --> 03:59:28,030
Just beat the game

1634
03:59:28,030 --> 03:59:38,750
Link link. All right. I'm clicking now. I got it. That's not even the right one

1635
03:59:38,750 --> 03:59:46,670
That's another one. That's a cop handing you something through the window. Not the right one. Is this the right win?

1636
03:59:47,270 --> 03:59:50,340
This is the right one. That is not worth it

1637
03:59:50,700 --> 04:00:40,319
It's not worth it also wrong. Okay, how about what give me the right one then? All right, whatever city

1638
04:00:41,319 --> 04:00:44,500
Alpine coastal. All right, we're going coastal

1639
04:00:46,809 --> 04:00:49,049
Definitely going coastal

1640
04:00:49,690 --> 04:01:07,149
This is the last race I'm gonna do and then I'm just gonna turn it off and then we'll put it in I

1641
04:01:07,629 --> 04:01:10,129
Think we change I'm gonna change the theme up a little bit here

1642
04:01:10,649 --> 04:01:15,709
Yeah, it's time for a theme change. They pick a different car

1643
04:01:23,469 --> 04:01:46,379
What happens if I kill him? Oh, what a race?

1644
04:01:46,899 --> 04:02:16,540
All right, I'm done. This was fun. I'm done moving on what we got next. I mean, this was not fun

1645
04:02:17,540 --> 04:02:31,489
Madden all right. I'm gonna put in madden. I'm putting it in we're gonna get it off with I'll give you a choice

1646
04:02:32,010 --> 04:02:57,100
your choices are

1647
04:02:57,100 --> 04:03:13,290
John Madden the original video game on a sports direction here. You can either do John Madden or

1648
04:03:14,819 --> 04:03:40,299
Wicked 18 which is a golf game one for John Madden two for wicked golf. Yeah, this is tough

1649
04:03:42,909 --> 04:03:44,829
neither one of them

1650
04:03:44,829 --> 04:03:54,299
Do an actual poll. All right, we'll do an actual poll because this is very difficult for me

1651
04:03:54,340 --> 04:04:14,829
There's drop all John Madden or wicked golf by the way

1652
04:04:14,829 --> 04:04:16,950
I want to make sure that I gotta get this has got to be very clear

1653
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:25,719
Just because it's called wicked golf does not mean it's interesting. It's golf. So could be pretty pog

1654
04:04:25,719 --> 04:04:33,209
I don't know. We'll see John bad. No, it's original FMV John Madden

1655
04:04:33,290 --> 04:05:01,340
There's at least probably five to ten minutes of John Madden talking into the camera. I think it's gonna be wicked golf

1656
04:05:01,579 --> 04:05:16,610
Let's go to BRB for a second. I don't blow your eyes out third option. There is none

1657
04:05:16,930 --> 04:05:24,399
There's so many games back there

1658
04:05:24,399 --> 04:05:32,979
We got a look we have to get through the wicked 18s of the world before we get to the Jurassic Park interactive

1659
04:05:33,180 --> 04:05:57,040
That's gonna be holy shit. No, we don't

1660
04:05:58,350 --> 04:05:59,709
Yeah, we do

1661
04:05:59,709 --> 04:06:05,940
About 40 of these I didn't buy like the ten good ones. I bought all 40

1662
04:06:06,459 --> 04:06:21,579
TV so why'd you do that? Because in 20 years is gonna be worth five grand

1663
04:06:21,760 --> 04:06:41,659
Wait, is this the thing that the arcades of the ball and you spin the ball as hard as you can golf?

1664
04:06:41,860 --> 04:06:49,399
There's the green why are we playing golf in

1665
04:06:50,170 --> 04:07:14,399
Egypt does not look at golf course because it's a wicked golf. Oh, sorry wicked 18 same damn thing. Who cares? Oh

1666
04:07:20,309 --> 04:07:23,389
whole number one par five champion teams

1667
04:07:24,309 --> 04:07:27,709
540 yards members teams 520 yards

1668
04:07:29,729 --> 04:07:36,129
The starting hole of devil's course is a part five that requires considerable skill water

1669
04:07:36,250 --> 04:07:44,329
Flanks both sides and rocks flow perilous. Why is this an eSports intro a good drive on a normal course may only find the rocks here

1670
04:07:45,010 --> 04:07:51,030
Fortunately, the approach is pretty easy after running this gauntlet. So a birdie is usual for this hole

1671
04:07:52,149 --> 04:08:04,959
Okay, use the driver every time I got it. It's the American Ninja Warrior intro

1672
04:08:06,139 --> 04:08:16,809
Okay member data. I mean was gonna what the hell game devil's open player one. That's an alien

1673
04:08:19,180 --> 04:08:29,260
Okay, sure. You weren't good at driving last game. What makes you think you'd be good at golf?

1674
04:08:29,639 --> 04:08:32,709
I'm gonna get a hole in one the first hit

1675
04:08:33,290 --> 04:08:36,690
First par two or par three that's available. I'm gonna get a hole in one

1676
04:08:43,819 --> 04:08:51,469
Just cardboard cutouts. Those are not real people

1677
04:08:52,030 --> 04:09:05,020
All right, first day player one versus Alan. Okay start this 17 holes here

1678
04:09:07,719 --> 04:09:40,280
How do you play him Alan the fucking volcano on the right he up. Oh, okay. Is he saying

1679
04:09:42,709 --> 04:09:44,469
Direction, okay direction

1680
04:09:44,469 --> 04:09:46,190
Where is the hole?

1681
04:09:46,190 --> 04:09:57,940
Pretty wood one wood. All right. I want the one wood. I'm just gonna hurt as hard as I can. Give me the one wood

1682
04:09:58,399 --> 04:10:01,530
Okay, you sure about that? Yeah, I'm sure

1683
04:10:05,620 --> 04:10:11,430
stance

1684
04:10:11,430 --> 04:10:13,430
Slice the fucking ball. Oh

1685
04:10:18,639 --> 04:10:38,040
Shit, that's just every single person at the driving range even go hit golf balls the driver

1686
04:10:38,040 --> 04:10:45,569
There's always somebody that just fucking skims it every single time. All right, let me try this again

1687
04:10:45,770 --> 04:10:58,600
Give me the one wood. No, I want the one wood. I'm going full power

1688
04:10:58,760 --> 04:11:11,600
I'm happy Gilmore in this shit over the mountain again

1689
04:11:25,629 --> 04:11:29,979
Embarrassing golfer I've ever seen

1690
04:11:30,100 --> 04:11:38,639
Music is so okay. Let's try it again. This guy's shit-faced

1691
04:11:39,280 --> 04:11:47,290
Well player one really probably shouldn't have come to the course after four Red Bull and vodkas

1692
04:11:47,489 --> 04:11:53,149
He's one of the top seeds. It's unfortunate to see him like this

1693
04:11:53,549 --> 04:12:02,879
then

1694
04:12:03,159 --> 04:12:04,520
People

1695
04:12:04,520 --> 04:12:16,340
Holy shit that bounce. Are you kidding me? There was some pinball level shit right there

1696
04:12:16,340 --> 04:12:19,920
All right, what do we think right through the middle? I'm gonna go right through the middle

1697
04:12:20,239 --> 04:12:44,420
What do you want to do to wood get it into the volcano? No, I'm going right through the middle bingo

1698
04:12:44,540 --> 04:13:03,260
How many strokes is this? Don't you just pick it up after seven? It's on acid

1699
04:13:03,680 --> 04:13:18,319
Okay, what point is the caddy just go? You know what? I'm gonna take over here, dude

1700
04:13:18,440 --> 04:13:19,860
Oh

1701
04:13:19,860 --> 04:13:32,059
Fuck so like every single golf game ever you do the power and then you press a again when it gets into the little middle

1702
04:13:32,059 --> 04:13:42,120
Thing right that's what I'm doing watch ready. I'm not doing it on purpose watch okay here

1703
04:13:42,120 --> 04:13:46,579
We go ready that bottom part is where I want to hit it here. We go power

1704
04:13:47,180 --> 04:14:11,829
Hey, hold it hold a all day and let go of a I try holding it and then let go of it

1705
04:14:11,870 --> 04:14:13,870
I'll try I am holding it

1706
04:14:20,000 --> 04:14:40,600
We good we live yeah, my internet didn't turn off my internet was fine

1707
04:14:40,600 --> 04:14:52,379
I don't that wasn't on my end my internet was perfectly fine. It's weird the twitch servers get nuked or something

1708
04:14:52,379 --> 04:15:06,000
That was weird. All right. We're back. I haven't even moved. Did you use that time to go look up how to play?

1709
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:14,260
No, all right. Let's go which has been doing that lately. Oh, oh, oh well sorry about

1710
04:15:15,200 --> 04:15:24,700
Whatever 270 yards. Let's go. All right. Let's go. Yeah, that wasn't that was not on my end. Oh fucking twitch servers. What the fuck

1711
04:15:30,719 --> 04:15:35,239
Fucking I'm gonna miss that was such a bad miss that was a practice swing

1712
04:15:35,680 --> 04:15:46,879
So do I have to do it before I'm trying to do it while it lands in the thing in the middle

1713
04:15:50,620 --> 04:15:52,100
Here we go ready

1714
04:15:52,100 --> 04:16:08,739
Up up right. I'm pressing a I can't I don't get it. I do it. I'm doing it too early

1715
04:16:09,420 --> 04:16:30,309
Are you pressing a on the orange part? I'm trying to all right. I get it. I get it. I understand what's going on

1716
04:16:30,309 --> 04:16:38,129
I'm going way too far up cut the viewer count in half. Well, it's whatever. It's all good

1717
04:16:38,569 --> 04:16:51,129
You did this. All right, dude. Give me a fucking break

1718
04:16:51,690 --> 04:16:55,120
Really? Really?

1719
04:16:55,120 --> 04:17:46,069
Gonna just gonna bounce that shit off the rock mine my turn. What do you think it's far enough away? Hey, thanks for the placement

1720
04:17:46,629 --> 04:17:55,479
Alright, can I can I hit it with it? Can I get it with the driver? I'm gonna go really small. Fuck the putter

1721
04:17:55,479 --> 04:17:58,000
I don't use putters only driver only one would

1722
04:18:06,440 --> 04:18:32,639
The crowd there is no crowd to hit those are paper cutouts. There we go on the green

1723
04:18:32,719 --> 04:18:59,739
That's like plus two meter. All right, it's a little bit slightly elevated. Can't even change clubs it in there

1724
04:18:59,899 --> 04:19:26,639
Okay, it's nine feet straight in. All right. What's that our player one plus twelve? What do you get? This is for birdie?

1725
04:19:32,399 --> 04:19:44,329
Wait, you got it. Damn it. I was gonna say that would have been way worse than me

1726
04:19:44,409 --> 04:20:07,680
Well number two coming up am I even on the board? All right now I get how the game works

1727
04:20:17,000 --> 04:20:33,879
We're going 300 yards straight ahead how much THC zero, all right

1728
04:20:33,879 --> 04:20:44,629
We got to try to get it right on the mountain. You could we sports music was that going?

1729
04:20:48,579 --> 04:21:09,989
Alright, I mean for an amateur. That's fine. I'm going right for the top of the mountain 318 yards

1730
04:21:09,989 --> 04:21:33,139
That's it's been son of a bitch. I flew too close to the Sun. It's alright

1731
04:21:33,139 --> 04:21:59,879
I'm gonna make it up right now. I'm gonna pay attention to chat. What how do you what what I have the same caddy

1732
04:22:00,040 --> 04:22:08,420
Wait, how am I supposed to do this? This is possible. There's a gigantic rock in the way

1733
04:22:08,420 --> 04:22:36,680
I got a ping-pong this 125 yards. I'm gonna go with 140 get it up the ramp. Holy shit. It worked

1734
04:22:36,680 --> 04:23:23,239
No, it didn't what? Oh, how did you do that? I can't hit mine over that. You're the pigeon wedge over it

1735
04:23:23,239 --> 04:23:39,500
I'm not far behind him 35 yards to the hole pitching wedge again. All right

1736
04:23:39,500 --> 04:24:00,899
I'm gonna take a little bit off the top halfway shit. You're not gonna get it. Oh

1737
04:24:17,639 --> 04:24:35,500
Can I get over this mountain? It's gonna be too hard. It's way too hard. No, it wasn't the shit

1738
04:24:35,500 --> 04:24:56,370
That shadow is really deceiving. Where'd it go? Where did it go? I went across the other side. All right, fuck it

1739
04:24:56,370 --> 04:25:30,209
Whatever. Give me the give it to me. I did skim it up the mountain. That's good. Get on the green

1740
04:25:30,409 --> 04:26:02,579

That's right. Just end it with Madden. All right

1896
04:59:30,860 --> 04:59:37,500
I'm gonna end it with Madden so then we don't have to start with Madden tomorrow. That makes sense

1897
04:59:37,700 --> 04:59:45,880
Plus another reason why I want to give this a link kind of a break

1898
04:59:47,200 --> 04:59:49,639
It feels very it's very hot

1899
04:59:49,639 --> 04:59:55,750
I don't think they ever expected people to sit here for five hours straight to play this game on this console

1900
04:59:56,029 --> 05:00:10,650
It's it's pretty warm and it's it's very hot. We shall see here comes Madden tomorrow

1901
05:00:10,650 --> 05:00:12,650
I'm also gonna get more details on FTK

1902
05:00:12,689 --> 05:00:19,479
Those who they're interested in that there's gonna be a lot of details tomorrow because that is happening this weekend on Sunday

1903
05:00:19,479 --> 05:00:29,840
All right, let's get mad in here

1904
05:00:35,990 --> 05:00:38,290
25 years old

1905
05:00:47,279 --> 05:00:54,130
All right original John Madden football

1906
05:01:03,479 --> 05:01:15,880
This is the man would he makes a horrifying demon noise, I don't think that's in any of them

1907
05:01:16,319 --> 05:01:30,200
I'm excited for this one

1908
05:01:30,200 --> 05:01:32,439
radio experience from Electronic Arts

1909
05:01:35,279 --> 05:01:36,119
exclusive

1910
05:01:36,119 --> 05:01:47,580
Hey folks, it's me John man today. We're gonna wait you actually not play football

1911
05:01:47,580 --> 05:02:05,119
Do you just watch games having a realization? Maybe I do not even play football. No, it's really weird

1912
05:02:05,560 --> 05:02:24,560
Don Madden has never played football. Yes. He did. Hi everyone. Welcome to John Madden football

1913
05:02:24,919 --> 05:02:26,439
Look so young

1914
05:02:26,439 --> 05:02:34,360
That's it. That's all the FMV we get

1915
05:02:53,080 --> 05:03:00,439
New England versus center, oh bring the bay regular season one player home

1916
05:03:01,159 --> 05:03:04,439
Yeah, the Jets. Yeah, fuck the Jets. Let's go

1917
05:03:06,000 --> 05:03:13,880
Well, the game's finally here the teams are taking the field and they're about ready to kick it off

1918
05:03:14,400 --> 05:03:26,500
Okay, why is he yelling that like he's in the bathroom yelling out to you like put the groceries away or something

1919
05:03:26,500 --> 05:03:30,400
I don't know. That was weird. Let's take a look at both teams. Here's how they match up

1920
05:03:30,860 --> 05:03:44,029
Okay, mine is to try harder. I'm that guy up for an hour

1921
05:03:52,700 --> 05:04:00,889
Why do they need an FMV for that

1922
05:04:01,689 --> 05:04:04,060
We won

1923
05:04:06,259 --> 05:04:08,259
We are going to receive the ball

1924
05:04:13,040 --> 05:04:23,369
Using team picks the home goal. Okay, let's go. Okay. Here's the opening kickoff. Everyone should be ready

1925
05:04:23,369 --> 05:04:26,810
It's the opening kickoff. Everybody shit. I can't see it. It's Trump

1926
05:04:26,810 --> 05:04:34,090
I can't even unsee it that you've ruined everything you've ruined John Madden for me. Why did you do that to me?

1927
05:04:54,680 --> 05:04:56,680
Five-yard game. All right

1928
05:04:58,770 --> 05:05:03,220
We're gonna go here Hail Mary pass

1929
05:05:03,619 --> 05:05:10,639
I get John Madden's advice like you could do in the other games. I'm gonna go big shotgun

1930
05:05:12,259 --> 05:05:22,639
Quick slant. I don't even know how to play audible. No, I want to

1931
05:05:32,560 --> 05:05:35,439
I was trying to throw the ball

1932
05:05:35,680 --> 05:05:44,450
We do I don't know how to play

1933
05:05:44,930 --> 05:05:47,490
Pats suck, huh? No, they don't

1934
05:05:48,209 --> 05:05:49,930
Alright, how do you pass?

1935
05:05:49,930 --> 05:06:15,770
Start a fine

1936
05:06:15,970 --> 05:06:33,720
I'm trying to pass the ball. It's I think it's see you snap with C and then you pass this thing

1937
05:06:33,799 --> 05:06:53,479
Okay, here we go. You not catch that one. Why did he not catch it? Why did you do that? Just catch it

1938
05:06:53,520 --> 05:06:59,259
You were right there. Oh

1939
05:06:59,259 --> 05:07:10,700
Damn, we're all the way back here tack center. This game's really old as illegal to be offside. So find out

1940
05:07:10,979 --> 05:07:28,330
Yeah, it is. They can't go any further. So who cares? I'm going right for the quarterback right down the middle

1941
05:07:28,529 --> 05:07:44,569
The guy kicked me in the face. I'm Brady

1942
05:07:47,389 --> 05:07:49,509
What I'm not even trying to block the field

1943
05:07:50,509 --> 05:07:54,139
Oh

1944
05:07:54,139 --> 05:08:09,990
Let's go for some run plays. Where's John Madden did an intro and an outro and that's it

1945
05:08:09,990 --> 05:08:25,799
And he got paid like six million dollars for this. All right, let's try. I'm gonna try to get a touchdown right here

1946
05:08:25,919 --> 05:08:35,779
Let's do a good drive normal. I'm gonna do

1947
05:08:36,740 --> 05:08:43,979
Near let's just do right here. HB toss. Hold that right side like that ball deflated ball

1948
05:08:44,479 --> 05:08:50,869
Very very very funny. Nice block

1949
05:08:52,029 --> 05:08:54,270
You knock that guy in the ground and he got up and got me

1950
05:08:54,750 --> 05:09:05,009
Just think you guys don't understand like you could say deflated ball. I don't care. I'm not on the Patriots

1951
05:09:05,009 --> 05:09:14,340
I don't wait. Would you just say about hate? I want that fucking team. I've run that team

1952
05:09:14,619 --> 05:09:20,220
Don't you say that about my team? I'm on it. I don't know

1953
05:09:20,220 --> 05:09:29,040
I'm not I don't have any connection to the Patriots and the cuts cool. They have New England in front of it

1954
05:09:30,880 --> 05:09:52,979
All right, catch it. That was such a perfect pass to press again. Is there a catch button? I think it's a

1955
05:09:53,540 --> 05:10:03,639
Ref get the hell out of the way

1956
05:10:04,400 --> 05:10:37,049
Tackle the ref. I'm not sure you can do that. It is the floss. Oh shit. You're right. That's amazing

1957
05:10:37,450 --> 05:11:00,790
Okay, I wonder if a is the catch button or it's C C is you jump in the air like a block

1958
05:11:01,310 --> 05:11:16,970
Long as the quarter last in this game. Hopefully not that long. Come on

1959
05:11:22,389 --> 05:11:28,439
This is my drive right here. I don't win right here

1960
05:11:29,099 --> 05:11:42,959
But I'll get a touchdown right here. I'm turning it off. Okay, we can talk a lot of shit if we want

1961
05:11:43,040 --> 05:11:47,360
This actually is pretty good for an old 3DO game. I guess wide open. There's no way they don't catch this

1962
05:11:56,580 --> 05:12:05,860
You mean by I'm still on this plays pretty well for a game that's 20 fucking years old more than that

1963
05:12:10,520 --> 05:12:18,549
The open is weak

1964
05:12:18,549 --> 05:12:43,599
No, I'm not turning it off yet. Not yet. Is it second and ten? Okay run. Where's my blocking?

1965
05:12:43,599 --> 05:12:45,599
We're the block if that's where I was supposed to go to the left

1966
05:12:46,840 --> 05:12:48,950
Okay, I'm in trouble

1967
05:12:48,990 --> 05:12:55,060
Hail Mary it just in the end. Wait, I was supposed to go right shit

1968
05:13:16,740 --> 05:13:18,819
Okay, John do you need any toilet paper

1969
05:13:19,580 --> 05:13:52,919
Give me a baseball game and I'll wipe the floor with everything. I don't play football. I don't know anything about football

1970
05:13:52,919 --> 05:13:54,720
I don't care about football. I

1971
05:13:54,720 --> 05:13:58,849
Don't know. I thought I thought this is gonna be a game

1972
05:13:58,849 --> 05:14:03,009
We're like John Madden grabbed his stomach and like shook it up up and down a bunch of times. It was like

1973
05:14:04,090 --> 05:14:06,610
Welcome to the game punk. I don't know

1974
05:14:07,409 --> 05:14:09,790
Fmv game. I think it was gonna be like an actual football game

1975
05:14:10,330 --> 05:14:31,779
The amount of question marks right there. I'm gonna be in the bath later. I'm gonna be laughing my ass off

1976
05:14:32,220 --> 05:14:42,240
That's a turnover. I need to get at least a one touchdown

1977
05:14:48,500 --> 05:15:16,069
And get it where's it I gotta stop screaming dude, let's you turn it over and you punty immediately

1978
05:15:35,909 --> 05:15:41,220
This time for real we're gonna punt it I mean we're pretty far away

1979
05:15:41,779 --> 05:15:43,779
We don't have very we're down by a lot of points

1980
05:15:50,369 --> 05:16:11,049
Fire that guy. Okay, good. Awesome

1981
05:16:11,689 --> 05:16:18,500
We're getting close first and ten. I think we should probably punt it here

1982
05:16:20,680 --> 05:16:25,259
Isn't a punt here if it goes through you get points the one guy ever in history that did that

1983
05:16:25,919 --> 05:16:42,799
Second time why would you guys has his back turned to me?

1984
05:16:56,659 --> 05:17:15,819
Watch down there. It is we in New England easy. Yeah, I'm simple. I faked this

1985
05:17:25,340 --> 05:17:31,389
I wanted to do I just wanted to give one point. It's a fake

1986
05:17:31,990 --> 05:17:37,180
What do you got? I?

1987
05:17:37,220 --> 05:17:41,419
This is me kissing somebody no more kissing images. I don't know. I'm not looking at it

1988
05:17:42,340 --> 05:18:04,799
It's me kissing Tom Brady. He saved it. Yeah, okay

1989
05:18:21,159 --> 05:18:31,360
All right two-minute warning that of what quarter

1990
05:18:34,639 --> 05:18:48,139
Second quarter, I want one more possession with the ball. I'm gonna tie the game that I'm gonna turn it off

1991
05:18:49,139 --> 05:19:08,319
We're gonna Chuck a Chuck E. Cheese juke. That's a word

1992
05:19:08,319 --> 05:19:12,799
I don't know how that's a sentence no one has you ever with that's a fucking up my brain

1993
05:19:13,439 --> 05:19:19,340
Chuck E. Cheese got a juke. What that's not even that statement is not making sense

1994
05:19:20,619 --> 05:19:38,599
They're punting it. All right, they're actually gonna punt it. What if they fake it though, you're gonna fake it

1995
05:19:38,599 --> 05:19:44,590
It's a fake pun. They watched me do it like ten times in a row. It worked. Oh

1996
05:19:47,779 --> 05:19:49,299
Can you do it?

1997
05:19:49,299 --> 05:20:09,500
Yeah, I almost had it. All right. This is my last possession. I'm going for it

1998
05:20:09,500 --> 05:20:15,240
Let's see if I can get 14 points tie the game and then everybody runs off the field

1999
05:20:15,540 --> 05:20:21,500
The New England Patriots have tied it up at 14

2000
05:20:21,500 --> 05:20:31,029
We all run into the clubhouse even with the timer still going Chuck E. Cheese is spamming links ban him

2001
05:20:31,669 --> 05:20:41,770
That link Chuck E. Cheese

2002
05:20:42,889 --> 05:20:54,770
We do. Oh shit. Yeah, you actually did get it. I thought people were just messing around

2003
05:20:54,770 --> 05:21:24,180
I saw like the path one the fake link or does that actually happen? It's got a delay of game. Oh god

2004
05:21:24,180 --> 05:21:34,419
Damn it. All right. No, all right. Stop. I'm done deep outs. Let's go. Why would I fake that?

2005
05:21:35,700 --> 05:21:46,119
This what?

2006
05:21:46,439 --> 05:21:50,759
Isn't this what um, Eli Manning's team did to the Patriots that one year

2007
05:21:51,279 --> 05:21:56,119
But Eli Manning just threw like five Hail Marys in a row and they like accidentally got the Super Bowl

2008
05:21:56,599 --> 05:22:01,990
It happened right

2009
05:22:01,990 --> 05:22:07,029
Eli Manning Manning just turned his back and threw the football backwards as far as he could has had on

2010
05:22:10,150 --> 05:22:18,279
That's all we get

2011
05:22:18,279 --> 05:22:23,849
points first downs

2012
05:22:23,889 --> 05:22:26,830
completion percentage 35 percent

2013
05:22:27,029 --> 05:22:43,599
None of these stats matter who won the game. None of those matters. Am I actually kicking it off? Oh, that's not good. I lose

2014
05:22:44,139 --> 05:22:46,889
You hear Otto

2015
05:22:47,049 --> 05:22:52,599
Yeah, he was just like, let me in I wanted to just get out but let me back in right now

2016
05:23:25,369 --> 05:23:30,810
All right, come on in no, I don't want to go in he rolls on his back and he's like, I just leave you alone

2017
05:23:31,330 --> 05:23:41,580
And he runs just played itself

2018
05:23:50,419 --> 05:23:55,779
Six already and Jermis having so much fun that the stream hasn't ended. Yes. I get to see more 3d. Oh

2019
05:23:56,299 --> 05:24:09,389
We tell him we tell him this is this is the last

2020
05:24:09,950 --> 05:24:17,880
Like five minutes string here of game until tomorrow. I love this console. I've been having a blast

2021
05:24:18,459 --> 05:24:29,490
All Sam's all right. Everything else I loved and we haven't even gotten to the real

2022
05:24:30,090 --> 05:24:52,830
Balls that I don't care almost me all time before the stream ends. Is that a game?

2023
05:24:53,549 --> 05:25:10,340
Go with this one Chuck E Cheese Panasonic sellout. We're gonna open tomorrow with Jurassic Park the experience

2024
05:25:16,669 --> 05:25:22,759
There's so many really good games left. I just didn't want to go into him hard

2025
05:25:23,080 --> 05:25:24,840
Today, this is the opener

2026
05:25:24,840 --> 05:25:34,459
We got some real shit tomorrow. We have Jurassic Park tomorrow

2027
05:25:35,220 --> 05:25:39,619
Possibly psychic detective that one's gonna be a real hit and already tell

2028
05:25:40,520 --> 05:25:54,090
Can't wait to play it

2029
05:25:54,090 --> 05:25:55,849
Jurassic Park

2030
05:25:55,849 --> 05:26:02,299
Road rash. That's right. Yeah, tomorrow's gonna be and some shitty ones, too

2031
05:26:06,060 --> 05:26:13,009
I don't know. What was that pass attempt failed you drop the ball. They never even did anything

2032
05:26:13,490 --> 05:26:22,020
You're gonna do wacky races again. I don't think we even need to

2033
05:26:23,810 --> 05:26:31,939
The perfect package. Why did you dive that way?

2034
05:26:34,060 --> 05:26:40,340
I lose I'll see you tomorrow wicked 18 was pretty fun, too. I'll tell you

2035
05:26:40,900 --> 05:26:51,139
Wayne couldn't even wink I'm gonna play plumbers. Don't wear ties

2036
05:26:51,139 --> 05:26:57,040
I don't have that but I'm not against getting it if there's no sex in it, by the way

2037
05:26:57,040 --> 05:26:59,439
Also, I'm not going to play sex on the 3d

2038
05:27:00,860 --> 05:27:03,889
There's a video game of the 3d. Oh called

2039
05:27:04,790 --> 05:27:06,090
sex

2040
05:27:06,090 --> 05:27:21,529
Thinking that was probably not streamable. I think it really is just porn. It's just porn on the 3d. Oh, which

2041
05:27:21,950 --> 05:27:24,569
Gotta say pretty. Oh, you really messed up here

2042
05:27:25,529 --> 05:27:28,150
Imagine having interactive porn

2043
05:27:28,830 --> 05:27:33,669
This thing would have sold to like hotcakes. It would have been on every single shelf

2044
05:27:34,209 --> 05:27:47,099

2048
05:28:18,299 --> 05:28:30,209
Well, yeah, I want to give this thing a rest. It's been spinning for five and a half hours

2049
05:28:30,689 --> 05:28:42,159
It's scaring me. You lost to the New York Jets. No, I didn't I abandoned the New York Jets game

2050
05:28:42,560 --> 05:28:53,349
It's a little different. We've ran away. We didn't lose. We ran now

2051
05:28:53,349 --> 05:29:01,779
You could say one's probably worse than the other but still didn't lose. All right. Good night everybody. See you tomorrow

2060
05:29:59,759 --> 05:30:06,619
