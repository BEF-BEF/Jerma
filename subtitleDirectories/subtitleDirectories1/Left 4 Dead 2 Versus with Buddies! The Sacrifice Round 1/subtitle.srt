00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,730
Hey, what's up everybody? We are doing some Left 4 Dead here with the group from Method Gaming.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,730
We've got of course Burger Boy here, even though he's not in Method.

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,730
But we've got Roxy, Boo, and Stealth in the call, so introduce yourselves, people.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,730
Hey, baby.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,969
Hello.

6
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,969
Stealth, what about you? You're like in this game right now.

7
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,969
I'm like watching American Horror Story right now.

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,969
I mean, I'm playing Left 4 Dead.

9
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,969
Why did I just do that?

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,399
It's like go kill zombies. I'm like in the game with you guys.

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,399
Oh, I have a question. When I pound someone with a hunter and I'm clawing away, how do I do more damage with my claws?

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,399
It just does it automatically.

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
Oh, I thought you could tap a button and it would do it more vigorously.

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,399
Yeah, you gotta hold L and R and you have to tap A as fast as you can.

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,399
That's how you capture the Pokemon faster.

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
Did you say hold L and R?

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,399
Yeah.

18
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,400
This is on the PC there, buddy.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh yeah, forgot.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Alright, let's make a little bit of a plan here.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
So Burger Boy's going that way.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Don't let Burger Boy get out around the corner.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
That's the main plan.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,439
I'm gonna go like this way.

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
Stealth, what are you doing?

26
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,439
I'm like sneaking up on these guys. They don't even know.

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
What are you guys spawning in as right now? What are you, Roxy?

28
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,439
I'm a hunter.

29
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,439
Because they're like trashing us right now.

30
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,439
I am in the worst of ways. I am a boomer stuck behind a fence. This is a disaster.

31
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,439
Oh, if you can boom one of them, try and boom somebody.

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
Because I'll be able to launch on somebody right now.

33
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,439
I'm too close.

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
Oh, I missed.

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,439
Oh, come on. Boom somebody. I'm waiting for the opportunity to do it.

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,439
Did you get someone?

37
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm gonna get Burger Boy.

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
Oh, shit.

39
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,439
Oh, sugar.

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,680
Well, I just got pasted.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Oh, really? So it's just me?

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,980
Good luck, Jerma.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Oh, what do you know about that one right there?

44
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
That was a sick pounce.

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,980
That was a sick pounce. That was really cool.

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,979
There's an old man. Let's get him. Get Grandpa.

47
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,979
What the? Get away from me.

48
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:20,629
Alright, they're gonna win.

49
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,639
Hold on, let's see.

50
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,639
I'm gonna wait for one of you guys to spawn. I'm not gonna just jump in there.

51
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,939
Why do I have the worst feeling that this man's ping is gonna be better than mine soon?

52
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,180
Let's go. Why the fuck not?

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,800
What? What?

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh, damn it. That's right. I have to climb up this. Okay, I get it.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Inconceivable.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,979
Inconceivable.

57
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,979
Oh, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Charge, charge, charge.

58
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:47,979
I'm a spitter.

59
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,219
There we go.

60
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm lost.

61
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
Oh, damn it. Yeah, I got him. I got him. Nice.

62
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
How do I crack the hunter?

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
Control? I don't know. F? Maybe H?

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Fucking PC is the shit out of me.

65
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,460
I'm so used to Xbox.

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Oh my god, that was such a... Oh my god.

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm just watching you.

68
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,759
Roxy, I'm just watching you just launch around.

69
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,759
Hardcore parkour.

70
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,939
Did they get like 50% of the way yet? What's the deal here?

71
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,939
He's healing. Just bitch slap him. He's about to go down.

72
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,939
Alright, this guy's going on his own.

73
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,939
Oh, he's healing. He's healing.

74
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,939
I'm going to get this guy right over here when he jumps over here.

75
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,120
Francis is healing a pup.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I think I'll be right back. I'm going to go watch a TV show.

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,479
Dude, you can't leave. You're still in the game.

78
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,479
Oh yeah, I'm playing.

79
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,479
This is bad.

80
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,719
I'm on Bill right now.

81
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,719
This guy knows I'm right here too.

82
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,719
Yeah, this guy knows what he's doing.

83
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,159
Come here.

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
There we go. There you go. Good, good, good.

85
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,159
Oh, look at that teamwork.

86
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,159
That's exactly what we wanted to do right there. Perfect.

87
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
Anybody in capped?

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
Zoe's about to.

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,099
She's a bitch slap away.

90
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,099
Oh, I got Burger Boy.

91
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,099
And all his teammates are nowhere to be found.

92
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,099
Try to get the next guy.

93
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,099
Sick.

94
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,600
Try and grab somebody.

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
There you go. There you go. There you go.

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on, spawn in, Bufu. Get a spit big. Get a spit over there.

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Nice.

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Francis is chasing the hell out of you.

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,089
He's dying in the spit.

100
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,089
We're coming back here now.

101
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,089
We got him in cap.

102
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,089
I thought he was team killing him.

103
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,089
Rigatone is going to do something epic right here.

104
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,089
They don't have any more health packs. They're all out.

105
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,089
That's good. No.

106
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,089
Oh, look at that leg.

107
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,230
What are you guys spawning in as right now?

108
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,230
Boomer.

109
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,230
I'm a hunter.

110
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,230
Try and get a boom on somebody, and then in the chaos, I will try and...

111
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,720
These two are going to die.

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
If somebody can just hit them with something.

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,670
Burger Boy is dead.

114
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,670
Oh, here's a witch.

115
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,670
If you can pull them into the witch, I can grow up on them.

116
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,670
Oh, I don't know where the witch is.

117
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,040
The witch is right here in the middle.

118
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Oh, you mad?

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Ah, got him.

120
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Come on, in cap.

121
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,110
Damn it.

122
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,110
Oh, they started the witch?

123
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,110
Yep. I get a boom on it and push them right into her.

124
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,110
Oh, she's an angry lady.

125
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,110
There you go.

126
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,110
There you go.

127
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,110
TK, TK.

128
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,480
Do not let them beat us.

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,649
We can't let them win.

130
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:31,649
Just do anything.

131
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:32,649
Hey, baby.

132
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,649
Good, good.

133
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,649
What?

134
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,649
I think I hit one of them, guys.

135
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,649
Oh, if I get this guy, it's all a good game.

136
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:38,649
Oh, gimme.

137
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,209
Oh, I got him. It's over.

138
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,209
Oh, nice splits.

139
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,209
Oh, come on.

140
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,209
Damn it. No.

141
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,209
Oh, times 24.

142
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,209
I thought they were all down.

143
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,209
Oh, crap.

144
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,519
Oh, he has a medkit. Cheeky bastard.

145
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,519
All right, well, if they complete this, we're going to do it faster than them.

146
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,519
Oh, he's going to throw me on fire.

147
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,519
Oh, shit.

148
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:04,550
Wait, that's you just on fire running over here?

149
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,550
I figured I'd try and do something.

150
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Did they get in?

151
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,550
This isn't the safe room, though.

152
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,550
Nope.

153
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,550
No, they got around the corner.

154
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,550
As soon as they jump down, there's the safe room.

155
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
All right, well, all right, boo.

156
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,550
You got to go for a boom.

157
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,550
I'm going to try and catch somebody with this.

158
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,560
Can you spawn inside still or is that glitched out?

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't know.

160
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
To be honest, I don't know.

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,839
Just waiting for somebody to drop.

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,839
I got this guy.

163
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,839
I got a smoker.

164
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,839
Yeah, I got a guy in cap right now.

165
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,839
Wait, is he dead?

166
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,839
Is he hit?

167
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Oh, no, he's on the ground still.

168
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,839
I got her.

169
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,839
There you go.

170
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,839
There you go.

171
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,839
Nice.

172
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,839
I'm good.

173
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,839
There's the vomit on a couple of them.

174
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,339
All right, come on.

175
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,339
Somebody just get in there.

176
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes.

177
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Oh, that's a nasty piece of work.

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
That's the safe room right there.

179
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
They made it.

180
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Just hopefully.

181
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, can we just like totally screw them right now?

182
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Just take them all out.

183
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm still dead.

184
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I have fit.

185
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I love Lewis's scream.

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Look at burden boy.

187
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
No.

188
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah, they got it.

189
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,970
They beat it.

190
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,970
All right, well.

191
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,970
Get ditched, Lewis.

192
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,970
There's no zombies around.

193
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,970
They just left.

194
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,970
Oh, well.

195
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,660
How long do they beat it in?

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,519
I don't know.

197
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,699
I don't think it's...

198
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,699
I'm not sure.

199
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,259
All right, we're going to do better.
