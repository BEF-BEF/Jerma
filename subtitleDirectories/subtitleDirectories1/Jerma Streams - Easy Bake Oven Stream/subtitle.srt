7
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,159
Disaster I got my tools ready as you see in front of you. I can't fucking believe I'm doing this stream

8
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:33,739

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,740
Scary

13
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:13,219
Your mic sucks. Well, um, I lost I lost the other mic and this is the if you want to know this this truth

14
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:21,860
This is this is the microphone from if you would believe it the lifeline stream. This is the lifeline microphone

15
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:30,340
It's for the PlayStation 2

16
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,180
I had a panic moment here like two or three hours ago where I was like

17
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,099
What happened to the mic that I actually always use? Where is it do a sexy pose?

18
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,479
Alright, that wasn't alright. Listen to me. This is important. Is it how is it crusty?

19
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,629
Is it like really crusty? I don't matter is it hold on

20
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:59,419
What if I move it a little bit? Is it how crusty is it move it away from my mouth?

21
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:10,680
How's that? Is that better? Is it a little bit better? Can that can now can you hear me? Do we sound better now?

22
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,540
All right. Okay. Excellent. It is actually better

23
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,500
Yeah, it's cuz I'm speaking out directly out this way and it looks like I'm on fucking QVC

24
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,860
Presenting the easy vague of them, which I'm not by the way, this is I gotta make this really really clear

25
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,920
This is really important

26
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,680
They have nothing to do with this. I know it's presented in a way like they would

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They have nothing to do with this. This is not I know it looks like an ad stream, but I swear to God

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,740
This is not an ad stream

29
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,709
This is just something that we came up with this thing hot. Okay, it is I'm like afraid of this

30
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:47,910
Have we talked about that yet?

31
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,629
How like I'm actually kind of terrified of this fucking thing because the old easy baked oven had a window here

32
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:57,839
Well, you could see what the fuck was going on now this new one

33
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:06,980
This is like the new age one. They've just wait did I peel the plastic off this? No, that's supposed to stay on there

34
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,339
Okay, the old one had a window that you could look through but this one just

35
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,839
Fucking it. How are you supposed to know when the food is done?

36
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,480
You just stuff it in here and wait like five minutes and then pull it out

37
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,779
How are you supposed to know because those of you guys that are like me whenever I use a real oven

38
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,709
I have to go up to the oven turn the oven light on and just sit there and watch

39
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,750
Because I don't trust anything. I don't trust myself

40
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't trust the oven there if it's like 400 degrees

41
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,029
You have to do a pizza for like 20 minutes that oven light has to be on at all times

42
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:41,750
And I have to fucking is it burnt is it burnt is it no no is it burnt is it burnt?

43
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,540
So I can't really do that with this. What a loser. I mean, that's what I do. I don't I don't cook

44
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,779
Okay, this is gonna this first cooking stream I've ever done. So which one of these do you want to start with?

45
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,050
We have what do we even have now?

47
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:10,939
Well, we're gonna do them all. Here's the pizza. That's pizza. This has egg wash

48
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:23,980
Adult supervision required how do I I don't I don't see how an eight-year-old can do this eight plus

49
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:31,339
I don't I don't think I I don't think I was able to even leave the house before I was a let alone use an

50
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:39,480
Oven eight plus. All right, so you should I start might as well start with the pizza. I got my shit ready

51
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,720
This I got my water bowl just in case I get thirsty

52
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,620
I was thinking about doing a joke when this first started where I was gonna like oh I'm thirsty and do a dog

53
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,639
Lapping up out of the bowl joke, but then I was like, no, that's fucked up. I don't think I want to do that

54
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,139
I was gonna be like, oh nice water, but then I would fucking ruin the day

55
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:05,860
I would just it's just too early for that. It's it's only been like ten minutes. That's why wait

56
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,350
This is an adults only stream. Oh shit. That's right

57
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,389
Mature audience thing is on why

58
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,800
Mature easy bake oven stream that doesn't make any sense. I bought stained

63
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,209
Do I actually need a fucking egg? By the way, I'm not gonna eat any of this

64
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:08,319

65
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,990
Oh my god, it's in like a bag

66
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,899
By the way, they have nothing to do with this stream. Like if I talk about how gross this is

67
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,779
I just just my my opinions on the product. Okay, this is my opinions on their product. That's it

68
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,060
This is my opinions on the product. Nobody had any fucking note that the Hasbro had nothing to do with this

69
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,049
Can you see me? This is my opinions on the product. That's it. Okay, here we go

70
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,570

74
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:05,649
I feel like I'm doing a presentation at a county fair with the microphone and that there's the easy bake oven as you can see

75
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,850
It's all powdered. So your children are gonna love it. Yeah, and there's like one person in the audience

76
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,409
There's like

77
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,490
200 empty seats

78
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:21,379
I'm telling you your kids are gonna love this and then they got that's that one guy comes up and buys it and he

79
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,220

00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:23,230
I'll just have to like I'll just have to like fucking get up there and like

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:30,990
It'll be fine this thing this thing just started ticking it was like

91
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm in like I'm in a studio right now. I didn't bring any butter. Alright, let's start

92
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,330
Let's make the sauce pour one marinara sauce mix and one and a half teaspoons. This is a teaspoon

93
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:07,779
What is this? What is this? Is this a teaspoon or is this a tablespoon by the way?

94
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:14,289
Why can't they just be one two, three four or five? Why does that tablespoon teaspoon a pinch a dash a

95
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,090
Tap none of just one two, three, four or five

96
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,649
Why does it have to be like that just why I don't understand why teaspoon and tablespoon

97
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:32,570
Tablespoon should be two teaspoons should be one or zero. All right marinara saw. Where's that marinara's mix artificially flavored?

98
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:40,049
Oh, you really grandma didn't make this. Are you sure maybe she did? Okay

99
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,049
Pour one and a half pour the marinara sauce mix into a bucket. I'm gonna put it in here

100
00:11:46,090 --> 00:12:00,080
Can you see what I'm doing here? All right, let's take a look. Okay in there. It looks

Looks like fun dip. Don't knock that over. All right strawberry fun strawberry mint fun dip. All right, there it is

102
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:20,759
Oh, that's a smell that I've not smelled in my life

103
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:29,600
Okay, so then pour one and a half teaspoons of water into into bowl stir the mixture with a spoon and set it aside for later

104
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:42,850
Okay, so here's one why does it have to be this hard kind of fucking spoon is flat

110
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:45,700
Little bit more just one more. There we go. Okay, good. Stop. Stop. Stop. I'm not gonna fucking spill it

119
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,870
I think they're gross and

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,309
This is kind of what it is. It's just looks like this. All right, this is gonna start to solidify

Okay, okay now make the cheese pour one garlic herb cheese mix and water into a bowl and stir the mix with a spoon and

There's such a little amount of sauce that I don't want to waste it all and I don't want to eat it

143
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,390
I don't want I don't want to go like this. Mmm, cuz I don't I'll probably throw up by the way

144
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,390
And just in case I throw up. I just want everyone to know

145
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,880
I've got a fucking trash bag over here. So I just like put my head in the trash bag puke in here

146
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,119
That's the goal and it'll work

147
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,819
I'm just gonna like wrap it up and puke it off camera and like turn mute the microphone. Oh my god

148
00:17:53,819 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't say puke. Okay, one and a half teaspoons. We're gonna do it slowly. This is not enough water

149
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,359
Oh, wait a minute. This is like turning into like blue cheese. Oh

150
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:43,569
That's cottage cheese. Don't say cottage cheese. Don't say cottage cheese

151
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:53,029
I think it's supposed to look like this. It's supposed to be like pretend to be cheese, right?

152
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:57,960
This is gonna be sprinkled on top. This thing's gonna burn. I think is this gonna light on fire

153
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,279
No, why would this thing is made for eight-year-olds? Why would it be like that? Okay, this is good. That looks pretty good

154
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:11,450
Right. What do you guys think scrambled eggs like the okay scrambled eggs

155
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,109
But the very end of the scrambled eggs after you scramble the fuck out of them and you're done the shit

156
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:21,819
That's left like in the pan. That's all around the sides and shit. Don't why am I saying this? Okay

157
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:28,240
Now what make the cheese make the glaze

158
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,369
Pour one egg wash mix and two tablespoons of water into a bowl stir the mixture with a spoon and set it aside

159
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:43,039
How much bullshit am I gonna have to fucking to use all this just for this tiny little like iPhone case?

160
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,250
Hold on get that out of the way. I'm gonna have to fucking wipe that down

161
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:55,819
All right. Next is the is the glaze egg wash. I gotta get the balls

162
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,420
Just are gonna keep getting more and more comically oversized

163
00:20:00,099 --> 00:21:43,039
I'm the only fucking idiot on earth that gets a children's toy

164
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:58,829
And gets bulls designed to make food for like 10 people keep getting bigger burn out of room

165
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:02,210
All right, I don't need the lids then he's gonna go rotten or what?

166
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:13,200
How come I do an egg wash? Oh, I gotta make sure these eggs stay fresh

167
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:25,599
I got it. All right clean as you clean as you go, right clean as you go

168
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,839
I'm not gonna make a fucking mess. You know, I mean clean as you go

169
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,710
my puke bag

170
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:40,759
And the best thing about this is like if I want to spit something up if I want to like spit out what I have

171
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,680
Like I said, I just I just wrap my head around this

172
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,039
You don't even know what happened and I just like let it feel like just worm out of my mouth

173
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,799
You won't even know what happened

174
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:57,049
Like I can literally just go like that and just go and you won't even know what's next egg wash

175
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:08,200
Egg wash and two tablespoons of water. This is egg wash, right? This is yellow

176
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,769
I hate the smell of eggs like a raw egg is

177
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,859
Enough to drive me crazy

178
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:25,680
Do you guys hate that too us of raw egg has a very distinct gross smell and I don't I don't like it

179
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:39,740
So what I was saying before, you know

180
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,849
When like when I was setting this all up and I was like, you know

181
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,609
Getting the cameras ready and getting like getting you know

182
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:48,009
Going to the beach and getting to the fucking beach

183
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,569
I was just like looking at the table and over the other setup and everything

184
00:23:51,569 --> 00:24:00,799
I just said kind of under my breath. What the fuck am I doing this eating sand?

185
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:11,640
It does kind of look like sand. All right, I got a this is just broke

186
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:22,900
It's just fucking broke and it just broke. How am I supposed to I'm just gonna use my hands

187
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,480
It actually just broke it actually did look at look at this. It's a that's like a clean weird break

188
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:38,380
Can I put just push it back together? Okay. No, that's all right. I gotta get this

189
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,059
Okay, we're almost at the part where I make the dough get this out of my way

190
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,880
I need to like where's my where's my towels? Thank you

191
00:24:50,880 --> 00:25:10,509
You know, I got to fill another one of these with water and just cuz this is not gonna work

192
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:23,650
Actually, it kind of is. Yeah, it's good. It's a really fucking matter. I should have got like ten to these tools

193
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:39,859
Somebody said this is cursed. Why it's it's an easy bake oven. What's wrong with this? What is it? Nothing wrong

194
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,440
It's contaminated it's not

195
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:52,960
Contaminated guys all this came from the same fucking factory. What do you mean contaminated?

196
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:02,079
This all came from the same conveyor belt in between in between like pushing out glue. This is the same factory

197
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,740
This is my opinion. There's a joke

198
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,420
I just want to make sure that you know that Hasbro had nothing to do with this and this is me making up a satire on

199
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,660
What could possibly be going on in a weird factory?

200
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,359
There's nothing to do with they'd have nothing to do with this and I have nothing to do with them

201
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:22,200
These are just my comedic opinions on things that aren't even real to joke and it's the satire

202
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:30,859
It's a parody of moment. Okay, what do I do water? How much water two tablespoons of water?

203
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:47,539
This is actually like fun though. Can I be honest? Is that too much water? What is this supposed to be?

204
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:53,019
What cut what kind of what do you do? What Pete's what do you do with pizza? This is what is this?

205
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:57,150
How is this a pizza? This is this is like dog puke

206
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:03,630
This is not I have to use the spoon. I know just get rid of the handle

207
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:20,720
Just get rid of the I get rid of the handle whatever if this still works. It's just annoying. Okay, what's what is that?

208
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,140
What's the FDA or the what FTC say about food being out for how long there's 20 minutes, right?

209
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,440
They use it like food can be sitting out before it starts to be like poison. What is it? Somebody knows it

210
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:51,240
That's this is this is not I don't like that. This is just to like make the dough look like it's cooked two minutes

211
00:27:51,240 --> 00:28:00,619
I can't believe that thing just broke in my hand. That's unbelievable. Best part about this is because there's so little stuff

212
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,920
I've realistically just have to like wipe

213
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,710
Wipe wipe wipe and then just like to be ready for the next one because this is barely anything

214
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:16,740
All right, make them now. It's time to make the pizza. We need one pizza dough and one

215
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,859
Nothing like in there, right? Okay, we need one pizza dough mix and one tablespoon of water

216
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:43,250
There are two pizza dough mix is why spit spit you want me to spit in this no

217
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:59,150
I'm not spitting in this are you guys fucking crazy? Why are there two? Why are there two of these? Okay ports?

218
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm whatever. I don't know why there's two you make two pizzas spit in it. I'm not gonna spit in this bowl

219
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm not even I think I think that's like not even allowed on twitch. Can you spit on twitch is spitting allowed on twitch?

220
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,119
Can I like spit is that allowed?

221
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:24,009
Spit switch. Am I gonna get like banned for like spitting in this bowl? Oh water

222
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:38,759
I've been looking no, that's not a good transition there. Okay. Okay. I'm almost ready

223
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:55,359
How long does it take to cook six pizzas six split the dough into six pieces and what a small balls

224
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:03,000
How am I supposed to me? How do you what do you mean? Are they supposed to be like bagel bites? What is the oh?

225
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Shit, they're supposed to be little bagel bites. I thought it was gonna be like a like a like a I don't know

226
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:21,109
I don't like like it's like a Sicilian style like a like a square or something. I don't know. Okay, let's go

227
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:24,319
This I have to start using my hands. Oh boy, how much?

228
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:37,990
One tablespoon of water that's way more than a tablespoon shit. It's okay. Okay use your hands

229
00:30:38,589 --> 00:31:09,599
Stir and press the mixture together until you get dough with my hands. Where's that shitty little thing? This is not pizza dough

230
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:18,220
How is this pizza dough? It's ruined. I need more water. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

231
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,720
There's a hair in this. I can't use this anymore. I have to go to a new one

232
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,400
There's hair in here. Look, there's like a speck of something in there. Can you guys see in there?

233
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:38,190
Do you see the one speck of some kind of foreign debris? I can't even use this now. I hate that shit

234
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,720
I hate it. Okay, that's enough water. Put this book put this back down

235
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,650
Why did I have to do the complicated one first? This is definitely like the most complicated one

236
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,650
Why couldn't I just dump the brownie packet into the fucking ground and then just stir it up with my finger and put it in there?

237
00:31:52,650 --> 00:32:08,140
That's what the next one's gonna be. This is not this is not pizza. This is not pizza dough. This is gonna be

238
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,619
Like crackers. This is the bottom of the Lay's potato chip bag

239
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,119
This is not this is the shit that you like dump out because it's not even edible

240
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:30,759
Yeah, and you think you get all cute you dump the fucking bag up and it goes half in here and like

241
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,700
75% go around and you crunch it it hits the floor and you like cut all around your teeth

242
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:49,500
I need more do I need more water somebody help him what use my hands

243
00:32:49,500 --> 00:33:00,970
I'm not putting my fucking hands in this disgusting. I have to do I have to use my hands

244
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:08,940
I have to knead the dough. Okay, hold on. I

245
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:14,140
Okay, that thing started making weird noise

246
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Where do I put this um

247
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:30,930
That's this just dough. Hold on. I need a like this, right? You go like like stand up for this

248
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:49,920
Why don't I just make one big pizza? Why do I have to make six more?

249
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:57,319
I need to you didn't have to do it. Just do it somebody somebody call OSHA. He didn't wash his hands

250
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:11,110
Okay, this is as good as it's gonna get like that. Okay. How are you supposed to make six?

251
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:20,750
This you don't make six out of this this is one this is smaller

252
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:33,110
I don't have to make a pizza. What does it say flatten each ball of dough?

253
00:34:33,110 --> 00:35:06,679
Like a pancake and shape it into a circle. Okay, here we go. Is this too big? Holy fucking shit

254
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,159
Okay, but I gotta make it nice. All right, I'm doing like three

255
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:22,000
This is I feel like this is gonna bake into the pan and never come up like this is gonna be part of the pan

256
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,880
Okay, let's do another one. You don't have any oil. I

257
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:36,599
Didn't say I needed oil. I don't need oil. Do I use CBD oil?

258
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:50,460
I don't have CBD oil just spit on it. It's gotta be something I can butter

259
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,889
I do I thought it was all gonna be inside of the packages. I think it'll be alright

260
00:35:54,889 --> 00:36:03,619
I think it's gonna be alright. Okay, here we go. I'll just I won't put it in there for that long go to the store. I

261
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,800
What do you want? Just leave the stream on well, I go to like a grocery store

262
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,960
Alright, how about this if this is a fucking disaster?

263
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,230
I'm going to like just go to a store and I'll put on like if the fucking I don't know put on like

264
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:35,230
Spongebob Squarepants OST. I'll be back unironically. Yes. Okay, here we go. Okay, I'm gonna do like two cuz this is just this is ridiculous

265
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:51,570
Take us with you. I know what taking you with me. How many fucking people are here?

266
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:59,630
I didn't they're like eleven fucking thousand people here. What are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here?

267
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:06,800
Why are you here right now? Oh my god shit. I gotta make this I gotta do this good

268
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
Then I can't just I can't believe I don't have any fucking cooking spray

269
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,480
Alright, I'm doing four the one thing that I fucking couldn't eat it. I didn't bring any of it

270
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:26,480
There's two packets. There's no way you make six out of this. No fucking way

271
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,449
In fact, how am I gonna even put like the sauce on here? This doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense

272
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:44,820
I can't even fit this one on there. How small did they want you to make these? All right. Yeah. Oh, here we go

273
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:57,710
I'm ready on the next part. Oh, I ripped it in half, right use a pastry brush

274
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:10,659
To spread some glaze on top of the dough. What the eight-year-old has a pastry brush

275
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:25,780
It's it says you can use your finger. Okay, the glaze wait. This is like oil, right? Hold on

276
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:39,360
Wait, can I put this on the bottom too? This is like oil, isn't it? It's like a glaze. No, don't don't what do you mean?

277
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:51,519
No, why it's a it's like a it's like a glaze you're gonna burn it

278
00:38:51,519 --> 00:39:13,389
No, am I didn't say that doesn't say could burn careful. I think that looks alright. Why would have this much glaze?

279
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:20,400
It smells

280
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:31,760
Okay, if I could like bring you here with me right now, this smells like it's like it's like it's like it's implanting me somewhere

281
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,079
Like I'm going somewhere right now. I'm like on a journey. I'm going to I'm going somewhere. Where am I going?

282
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:50,239
It's summertime. It's summertime. There's a hot dog vendor sausage vendor. Not hot dog toxic fumes. What? All right

283
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,110
Fuck. Never mind hot dog vendor sausage vendor

284
00:39:54,130 --> 00:40:06,789
It's like the air the air that's coming off of the guy that makes those sausages that at the kiosk. Okay, that's good enough

285
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:26,199
This is fucking eight-year-olds. Yeah, right more like I'm just gonna wash my hands in here

286
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:38,820
I'm not gonna need the water anymore. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm gonna that's all right sausage sweat

287
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,860
Okay now spread the marinara sauce on top of the pizza

288
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,159
Be sure to save half the sauce for your second batch of pizzas. No, thanks

289
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:58,570
I think I think it's going in the trash. This trash is gonna smell so bad. Thank God

290
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:04,139
It's one of those like double ultra ones. All right, let's put the sauce on here. This is good for now

291
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,400
Okay, so sauce goes on top and

292
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:41,210
Can you see I did it? Right? That's what you do. You go you go middle out

293
00:41:41,489 --> 00:42:00,500
What are those? What are those pastries that have like the raspberry filling in the middle?

294
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:07,940
What are those things called? You know talking about the little the cookies with the raspberry jam in the middle

295
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:15,369
That makes me want to eat those. I think this is too thick. I think that's the problem

296
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:24,579
How hot is it gonna get in there? I'm it's like freaking me out

297
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:29,429
I don't know why I feel like I'm gonna push that in there and like just like

298
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:47,489
Burger King commercial is gonna like be up the top here. I'm afraid of this. All right, that's enough sauce. That's enough sauce

299
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:54,739
That's enough sauce. That's a good amount of sauce. I think okay. I'm gonna put that in there now. Let's put the cheese on there

300
00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:00,199
I think the cheese is supposed to not be solid

301
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,739
They're making it look like you can squeeze it out of a bag

302
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,099
Spoon the cheese into a plastic sandwich bag and cut a small hole in the corner squeeze out strings of cheese

303
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:28,030
Hey, hey, this is this is like they you this is like they do in the restaurants with that big glob of mozzarella

304
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:47,880
See and this is gonna spread out there. They are that I don't like a lot of cheese on my pizzas

305
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,639
How does that look? Can you see?

306
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,929
For some reason on the back of all the Ritz crackers boxes. This is what's on the back every single time

307
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,530
I don't know why I don't know who the fuck does that shit

308
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,449
I don't know who puts like sauce and like cheese and like Dorito powder on there. It's Ritz crackers

309
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:17,440
But I don't know why that they do that. All right now it's ready time to bake. All right bake for 12 minutes

310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,239
12 fucking minutes. I thought this is gonna be like give 10 5

311
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,719
It's a twitch 12. All right. Now I gotta which way does it go in?

312
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:40,639

The thing on top, okay, here we go

315
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:32,590
I think it's stuck in there what if I get stuck in there and I like have to pull it out of the wall

316
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:43,369
Is it in there timer timer? What time is it? I don't know ten minutes start the time

317
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:50,219
Oh, what time is it right now? I don't even have fucking watch. What time is it? Is it in? Yeah, I think so

318
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:57,710
Yeah, it's in there and then you like push it out to the cooling side timers on the front of the oven

319
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:01,860
No, that's just it. That's a picture. That's not real. How the fuck am I gonna?

322
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:55,659
So

00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:31,139
It's been two minutes, all right, can you guys even hear me there's a timer on the front

324
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,639
No, the timer on the front is a picture

325
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:42,250
Don't touch anything the timer on the front. It says 330 is a photo. It is a fake picture. It's a fake photo

326
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,250
Oh

Sesame seed bagel in here. It would be perfect on the way out. It doesn't it thinks who cares. It's not raw. Okay, okay

346
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,880
Well, your brains only capable of doing one thing at a time

347
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:16,769
Cook harder. You have no passion passion for easy bake ovens. How do you have a passion for an easy bake oven?

348
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:23,500
Well, I guess somebody has to have passion for somebody has to design this and make this and shit

349
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:29,019
Did you have to be you know, there's engineers that were really into this

350
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:33,679
So yeah that you would be very passionate

351
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:40,940
I would think they give you it's your job to make this like cool device that kids can

in fact so well in fact that it is bonded with the middle of my mouth and

409
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:48,519
I do like the creativity though pretending that you're a child. That's really really nice of you to do that

410
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:57,750
You know the childlike way that you cooked in the kitchen, but I will say for those reasons

411

Those are the two shows that I combined chopped and shark tank. That's how fast this fucking brain goes

Okay, stop doing the fucking jokey guy and just get it over with of my teeth

428
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:49,909
I think my teeth might be stained forever

429
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:55,239
What if I had just like two black teeth up here for the rest of my life?

430
01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:01,300
I imagine I'm gonna go to the dentist and tell them like that. You need your teeth fixed. Well, what happened?

431
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:12,050
Well, you know, I ate food from an easy bake oven that I undercooked. All right. All right, give me a minute

432
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:46,949
That was in my teeth and no wonder it like it's not coming out of this either

433
01:04:46,949 --> 01:05:11,070
I have to run this through a dishwasher like four times and plug the oven. Why why it's fine

434
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,150
It's if the things meant to be turned on and it's gonna be preheated

435
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:27,530
This hot. All right, this is

436
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:38,219
We start with you. It's gonna take equal amount of time to clean these bowls to be ready cuz I

437
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:45,780
At some point you have to say who cares and like some of your brownies gonna taste like cheese. I

438
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:51,969
Can't hear him. Hello. This one's good. This was right

439
01:05:52,469 --> 01:06:00,650
Clean, right?

440
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:19,610
Be right now I'm not even here next up this one almost ready

441
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,010
Okay, I gotta really conserve these

442
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,869
Where is he? What are you talking about?

443
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:51,860
I'm right here. You know 2020 is always hindsight, right?

444
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,340
But I should have done this outside and just had like a hose somewhere that I could just spray into all this stuff and

445
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,340
To be ready to go

446
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,099
Okay

447
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:12,539
This is ready for round two done

448
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,820
this one almost I

449
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,190
Can't see him. I'm right here. What are you talking about?

450
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,750
You are outside. I'm pretend outside

451
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:33,880
All right, at some point I'm gonna have to just kind of let this thing

452
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,719
Like it ain't gonna happen because and I'm gonna have to just use another bowl because I have another fresh one right there

453
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:56,900
No, it's coming up it's good it's gonna take a minute see the real smart person thing to do

454
01:07:57,539 --> 01:07:59,539
Like have somebody hired

455
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,739
To have two bowl sets and one person's cleaning the bowls while I'm doing set number two. I

456
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:11,789
Need a fucking goddamn assistant what stop wiping us. Oh

457
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,029
There we go, sorry about that

458
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:23,590
This stuff is fucking acid. It's still coming up

459
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:30,689
Why it's like this?

460
01:08:31,329 --> 01:08:43,779
Am I wiping off the dye on the bowl or is this still the sauce? Holy shit, that's loud

461
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,819
Gmod Mike

462
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:52,569
All right. I can go up there and I can turn it down and I'm gonna go do that. This is almost ready

463
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:57,840
So what am I making? You guys have seen what's up there? We got pretzels. I'm not making the pretzels right now

464
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,680
I don't want any more disgusting smelly like savory food that'll I'll gag

465
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:11,880
We got what do we got this brown? Yeah, there's brownies there. I actually I would eat the brownies

466
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:18,149
Real food is gross when it comes to toys. Okay, real food is disgusting

467
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:24,439
It nobody wants to eat like real food coming out of something like this

468
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:30,949
Nobody does but like candy and the cookies and stuff. That's fine

469
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:35,369
It's it's it's no nobody wants to eat like a fucking hot dog in an oven like this

470
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:40,930
guys sugar flour

471
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:45,289
Salt and baking soda is like what a cookie is made out of right?

472
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:49,989
But like if there was like hamburgers in here, I wouldn't want like powdered hamburger meat

473
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:55,609
I don't want to eat like powdered cheese. I don't eat like powdered marinara sauce

474
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:02,699
This other thing is a powdered tomato, okay, no such thing to make a brownie. It's just like chocolate powder

475
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:17,100
Sugar eggs salt. It's I'm not you know, it's not powdered tomatoes like that shit was okay

476
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:26,119
This is good to go. All right, that one's ready one more and we're done

477
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:34,979
Actually, I'm gonna take a second to just get this water cleared out and then we can keep going

478
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:42,100
I'd be yeah, I don't need like this one. This this was the most complicated one. I

479
01:10:42,619 --> 01:11:06,159
Ain't spending 20 minutes cleaning that just get a new one forehead

480
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:10,859
Just get a new one. This is not the garbage bowl

481
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:26,899
Good point, but all pans are gonna have some like decay on them

482
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:41,550
You know what I mean? Like you're never gonna get a pan clean. Oh, no, you're never gonna get a pan fully clean like this

483
01:11:53,770 --> 01:12:01,060
My whole body is on fire I

484
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:08,500
Fuck I went like this in my nail

485
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:23,840
Nail on a chalkboard like fuck. I just screamed in your ear. Okay, fucking whatever. Don't do it again. Ah

486
01:12:41,369 --> 01:12:46,420
Give me a fucking easy one. Oh

487
01:12:46,939 --> 01:13:04,819
Goddamn gotta get some elbow grease in it. That's how you get it done. Mm-hmm. Look at that. Fuck his brain

488
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:15,609
You saying fuck my brain or you saying like oh, no his brain. Alrighty. Are we ready for the next delicious treat?

489
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:23,449
I have to turn the microphone down garbage bowl. You're right

490
01:13:23,449 --> 01:15:28,930
Those actually those are kind of good are we good so these two chocolate brownie mixes and two this this this is gonna be so much easier

491
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:37,520
Thank God. It's actually just two or three packets not like six. Thank God. All right chocolate brownie mix

492
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:47,670
Yeah, you get two of them just in case you want to go crazy

493
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:57,640
Yeah, this is gonna be so much better vanilla frosting mix. It's just two fucking things. Thank goodness

494
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,210
All right, clean as you go clean as you go

495
01:16:00,609 --> 01:16:02,050
Thank goodness

496
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:11,989
All right, clean as you go clean as you go clean as you go clean as you go

497
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:26,359
Clean as you go turn the oven on. Oh shit. That would have been bad

498
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:37,380
All right. This one will be nice and quick. I think I don't even do I even need should I try to do one of these

499
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,699
Without the instructions like fuck it. Just do that

500
01:16:40,300 --> 01:17:41,109
Dump brownie mix into the fucking container and then dump vanilla frosting into the container. I need water bowl

501
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:54,130
I'm about to throw that bowl in trash. You know what I mean?

502
01:17:54,170 --> 01:18:01,300
Like I'm thinking about just putting that in it's thrown in the trash, but you can't I mean, it's like plastic

503
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:06,720
I can't do that. That's terrible. Okay, here we go chocolate brownie

504
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:10,399
Surprise, what's the surprise?

505
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,210
marinara sauce on the bottom

506
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:33,880
Okay, here we are one and a half teaspoons of water stir until it's nice and thick. Okay. Oh, this looks nice

507
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:41,210
I actually like the way this looks. Okay, it smells like just

508
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:45,630
hot-chocolate powder, which is like I

509
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,670
Let me tell you something

510
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:53,039
Nesquik cocoa powder just even like chocolate milk powder

511
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:55,159
Tell me if you guys think I'm a sick fuck for doing this

512
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:57,159
I guarantee some of you guys do it too

513
01:18:57,159 --> 01:19:04,260
you just you stir in a little bit just like you know, maybe one tablespoon into your milk and you get it a little bit there and

514
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:10,180
Then you sprinkle on top a layer of powder on top of the milk

515
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:17,920
So it becomes this disgusting sludge and you take a sip after you let it wait sit on the top for about 10 to 20

516
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,880
seconds take a little sip and you suck up the wet powder and

517
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:30,880
And it's like I'm telling you try it if you don't if you I'm telling you actually this is good to have a big

518
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:41,250
Bowl. No, I don't I did do that. Yeah, I mean I don't do this anymore. I'm a grown man. All right

519
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:51,880
Okay, where's my stirring thing? This smells very good. This smells way better than powdered tomato sauce

520
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,460
All right, let's get our spatula and let's uh, let's work with it here. What do you say?

521
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:09,630
Okay, I'm trying to see yeah, let's actually move this out of the way LUL poop wine. It's chocolate. Oh, I get it

522
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:18,159
It's hey. Hey, it's it's brown in there. It must be poopoo. All right guys row up

523
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:34,510
How is this only need one and a half tablespoons of water?

524
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:45,760
Can somebody explain that to me because this is not even close. I need way more water than this

525
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:54,569
I think I might even need more than that

526
01:20:54,569 --> 01:21:02,449
You need like a cup of water in here. You didn't add one and a half. What? Yes, I did

527
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:07,369
I'm gonna get in there

528
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:19,359
Imagine being a parent and having your kid asked to do this on a one on a given day

529
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,779
This is one of those things where you just don't want to hear those words

530
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:31,810
No, can't you like go outside and just like throw shit around why I don't want to do this

531
01:21:31,989 --> 01:21:37,579
Who wants to do this what parent wants to actually have to go through the trouble with this shit?

532
01:21:37,579 --> 01:21:41,710
They want you to make food

533
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:47,529
Why don't you make actual brownies like why do you need this weird little fucking bagel toaster?

534
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:54,399
Just make a brownie just make brownies in your oven in your actual oven. What's this for? What is this for?

535
01:21:54,399 --> 01:22:03,649
I can't I was it for I don't get it. It's for kids. Okay, you kids can cook too, but you need supervision for this

536
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:05,859
caution

537
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:12,619
Supervision required so if you need supervision to use this you need supervision to use a real oven. So what's the pro?

538
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:17,779
I don't know. What's the deal? What's the problem? This actually looks pretty this looks pretty syrupy and pretty soupy

539
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:26,699
And pretty delicious it says mix concoction until it gets all syrupy and since savory and soupy. I got it there

540
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:36,020
All right, that looks good. Damn. This looks fucking good. I did a good job

541
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:41,300
I this is from scratch isn't me doing this shit from it's too loud might be okay now

542
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:49,100
We do the frosting easy-bake vanilla frosting. We'll do it in here. Wait, was this the one with the cheese in it?

543
01:22:49,100 --> 01:23:16,489
Okay. Now what is going to do water cheese frosting? We don't do this yet. Okay, roll these mixtures into balls

544
01:23:16,489 --> 01:23:38,659
I need to wait what already that might light on fire. I can't okay sprinkle flour on

545
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:52,149
Okay, so wait, this is supposed to be turned into a ball. That's not gonna turn into a ball. Hold on

546
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,390
Just eat it out of the fucking bowl

547
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:08,659
Wow

548
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:22,369
Okay, what are you supposed to cook this? Is this like rotten boy? Do I ain't supposed to cook that is it raw?

549
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,680
Oh

550
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,039
Smells in there it fucking stinks and it smells

551
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:44,039
College dorm room in here. Oh

552
01:24:47,409 --> 01:25:05,750
No, I have to go to the dentist after this one, okay

553
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:11,079
So you can't eat it raw it has to be baked cuz it's not there could be this like raw cookie dough in there

554
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:17,489
I can fix this though because there's two of these I'm gonna add this very slowly

555
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:30,539
You know, you can make a mistake. You make a mistake or two. It's fine. It's okay to make us mistake

556
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:36,930
You can fix it in post. This is this is the video editing of the cooking world

557
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:47,119
You just add a little bit more powder slowly and get it in there until it's all syrupy and soupy and thick and savory

558
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:55,470
How am I ever gonna put this into a ball? Well, um, should I just spread this on there?

559
01:25:55,670 --> 01:26:06,670
What if I just spread this onto the pan and make it like just on the pan and then put the frosting on top?

560
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:26,659
So it's just a big cake. What's wrong with that? It'll still work. This is not gonna turn into a ball, right?

561
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:38,750
No, how the fuck do people cook I swear to god chefs definitely just sit there while they're doing this and going like oh my god

562
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:44,430
This is fucking wrong. This is so wrong. This is the wrongest thing I've ever done. This is not fucking right

563
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,430
This is wrong and then like cut to the guy

564
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,199
Bringing it out and being like here is your salmon, sir. The chef prepared it fresh for you

565
01:26:51,199 --> 01:27:02,779
I swear to god like this is this shit's impossible. This is impossible. I'm just making a chocolate bowl

566
01:27:09,409 --> 01:27:26,470
Okay, okay. This is not I'm just gonna do the thing. I said I was gonna do let's try it

567
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:36,020
More powder, but I'm not gonna be able to even move it. What do you mean more powder?

568
01:27:36,020 --> 01:28:13,779
This is like one of the things I'm too tall for which how does that make any sense now?

569
01:28:13,779 --> 01:28:18,409
What remember this is for kids? Yeah

570
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:32,880
More powder make balls make balls. I'm not sure I can do that with this. It's just gonna fall apart. Look at this

571
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:40,300
It's it's it's too goopy. Don't put any more powder. Are you following the recipe?

572
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:44,300
Yeah, pour one chocolate brownie mix and add one and a half teaspoons of water

573
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:50,140
I think maybe that is I think that does need to be more powder, right?

574
01:28:50,180 --> 01:29:00,229
I think so because they otherwise a teaspoon. Yeah, but it was I couldn't even work with it

575
01:29:00,229 --> 01:29:14,619
It was so powdery. It was impossible. God. This is annoying. Just go to Dunkin Donuts. Just get one

576
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:34,720
They have like 60 balls. All right. Hold on. It's coming together. I might be able to actually turn this into a ball now

577
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:46,739
I'm only gonna make like a couple of these I think this is so all right

578
01:29:46,739 --> 01:30:05,149
This is starting to get hard to do more powder. Are you sure? Yes. All right, I'm not putting any more

579
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:27,670
I'm not doing any more powder after this. This is it terrible. Oh my god

580
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:35,220
What is this even supposed to do? How do you fuck up to a one ingredient bag? I don't understand

581
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:39,979
I think I need the other tool. This is gonna be impossible

582
01:30:39,979 --> 01:30:45,859
I think I gotta get in there with my hands, but I can't get in there with my oh, there we go

583
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:52,119
Look at that. I can scrape like I can scrape the bottom. All right. What do you think? Is it ready?

584
01:30:52,279 --> 01:31:00,140
What do you think that looks a little frothy?

585
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:15,899
Maybe a little maybe a little bit more powder just a little bit spinning it you're making a lot of dad noises

586
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:30,739
Fuck and whatever. Okay. This is definitely ready. Maybe a little bit more powder. I don't know

587
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:33,850
I've never made brownies before guys. I don't know what it's supposed to look like

588
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:39,949
I was hoping that there would be pictures in here to show me. I think this is good

589
01:31:39,989 --> 01:31:43,109
It's very it's very stringy. All right

590
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:45,670
I'm just gonna try to get a bunch of it and then I got a have it be a ball

591
01:31:45,989 --> 01:31:55,819
Okay, and then and then what make it if that defeat? Oh, these are whoopie pies. These are not brownies

592
01:31:55,819 --> 01:32:00,880
Why are you guys saying brownies whether whoopie pies? They're not supposed to be brownies

593
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:12,760
Okay, so we need to make two we're gonna make one. I'm only doing four

594
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:39,890
I'm doing one two and one two. Okay, how am I gonna do this turn on the oven?

595
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,819
The oven's on the oven is on the ovens powered on

596
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:52,710
Okay before I do this I gotta get this prepared. I gotta be ready for this. This is gonna be a disaster

597
01:32:52,710 --> 01:33:12,100
I gotta be ready with this just right here waiting for me. I can't turn this into a ball into a ball

598
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:24,619
This is just how a child eats dessert. Okay, it's almost a ball

599
01:33:24,739 --> 01:33:37,819
It's it's getting there and then I have to spread it out on here. Oh shit

01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:59,890
Hershey's kisses instead. Okay, there's one

601
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:20,659
No, no the baby got on the counter and it's just eating the chocolate out of the bowl

602
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:29,529
This is the baby. This is the baby is on the counter Jared my husband. Where the fuck are you? What are you doing?

603

607
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:46,100

608
01:35:48,409 --> 01:36:05,050
Barf it said use your hands

619
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:52,659
I can't go anywhere. I literally can't move. I'm gonna have to sit here for the rest of my life

620
01:38:52,699 --> 01:39:30,859
Is there an easy one in here just save scum I wish is there an answer an easy one

623
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:46,250
I just have to not have this all over me. I'm I'm like in trouble

624
01:39:46,250 --> 01:40:05,500
I have to pick this up with my mouth. Why did I pick this up with my fucking hands? What a joke?

625
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:21,670
What an idiot dope this thing this thing's like preheated

626
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:37,020
Well, hope you like a guy that is 35 years old almost that is stuck in his chair

627
01:40:38,069 --> 01:40:44,810
Because he couldn't figure out how to do the brownies on the easy bake oven and now he is actually

628
01:40:45,409 --> 01:40:51,159
Fucked because he can't move and now I have to like go wash my body. I have to go take a shower

629
01:40:51,319 --> 01:41:03,350
They're not brownies. Whatever. We'll see what they are when they come out of the oven

630
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:13,010
I need a cupcake pan that doesn't say that on there. It says put them on the tray click the link

631
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:22,470
Oh, yeah, click the link. Let me just reach for my mouse and grab it. Yeah, I can't do that right now

632
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:29,229
I told you I'm stuck forever. All right. I'm good. Here we go. I'll be right back. Okay now

633
01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:34,970
I'm now I'm at that point where I can literally clean myself up disaster

634
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:46,449
Why would I fucking do this with my hands? I should have I should have now that's a thought

635
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:54,619
No, that's a thought in this guy right here

636
01:41:54,619 --> 01:42:09,880
I can wake a ball in my mouth and then just like off-camera just put it on there. No, what do you mean?

637
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:17,569
What I'm gonna like form it in my mouth like and then just spit it out. I'll don't do that

638
01:42:17,569 --> 01:42:24,170
Don't there's an audio delay. How is there an audio delay? I have one. I'll like here

639
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:35,060

This it's gonna be loud

642
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,000
So just turn your volume down because I'm gonna literally just like wily coyote yank this off my head

643
01:42:45,000 --> 01:45:28,229
This is why cooking sucks

644
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:36,800
Okay, because it's just a shitload of cleaning you clean for like six times more than you cook you cook for like six minutes

645
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:49,000
And you clean for like two hours. This is my cooking sucks. All right, I'm gonna make the frosting time for the frosting

646
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,470
Okay, cool. I think preheated nice very very nice

647
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,300

01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:16,840
I'll click it. I'll click it. Give me I'll fix the volume too. Just give me one sec

01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:24,989
You know, it's like kind of remarkable I've not gotten a single damn thing

01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:34,989
Anywhere anywhere, but right here. That's that's remarkable. Okay frosting time after I click on the link

651
01:46:34,989 --> 01:46:37,869
I'll take a break

652
01:46:37,869 --> 01:47:01,220
Hold on a second. Like this is through the cookies. Hi, where's the link? You got a link for me?

Oh my god, that looks horrible. No, it looks like I got like an a hockey fight. Oh

655
01:47:45,609 --> 01:47:56,100
How many more of these are there? That's that's the wrong one. What do you mean wrong one?

01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:30,689
I can't spray the cupcakes that doesn't that's not on my book. That's not on my book. Read that. That's not a cupcake pan

658
01:48:52,619 --> 01:48:57,920
That's fine. Any more pictures you want me to look at before I go fucking ruin my reputation as an adult human being

659
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:21,359
Yeah, I saw that one. I'm back to it. You bought home on you're going too fast

660
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:27,229
You bought the easy bake up instead of the easy cupcake oven. That's a lie easy fake oven. Whatever

661
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:50,699
So I got I got sorry. It's a so it's fucked up. Who cares? All right, I'm going back over there any scraps for me

01:50:29,739 --> 01:50:41,220
See you later. That was back there. You're free to go. You are I need my instructions. No, I don't even need my instructions

665
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:47,239
It's water that I don't have any water

666
01:51:55,250 --> 01:52:02,210
Yeah, cuz I just pretended to blow a snot into the food like I would have left I would have been like, okay

667
01:52:02,210 --> 01:52:08,680
This who else does somebody else has to be fucking streaming. I have to do this whole thing in here

668
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,640
I don't know about that. This is a lot

669
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:46,960
What's next? Oh, I'm supposed to cook this sure. Okay, so just put it in

670
01:52:50,100 --> 01:53:01,529
There's only one but whatever what am I gonna do about it? How long well fucking minutes in no way

671
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:16,689
It's definitely not 12 minutes not for one. I know. All right, let's make the fraud

672
01:53:16,689 --> 01:53:27,800
This is gonna be the delicious part. I am excited for this one. Oh, yeah

673
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:39,409
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah smell that smell that one. That's just like a vanilla powder

674
01:53:39,729 --> 01:53:51,079
Okay, do I don't I don't need to make that much frosting for one little cake. This is too much frosting

675
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:57,689
This is gonna be the most savory I can't wait look just say words that have to do with food

676
01:53:57,689 --> 01:54:00,930
And people will think you know what you're talking about. All right, that's one's done

677
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:08,609
That's food. We need some water

678
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:27,279
How much water one and a half teaspoons? I think that's it right and then mix it up

679
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:48,840
I get I gotta move the vomit ball out of the way. Okay, here we go. So I'm not gonna add any more water

680
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:56,140
I'm not gonna be a psycho about this. It's not really as you can see it's mix it faster

681
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:01,250
No, that's not how you don't mix it faster is not better. So low it's slow and slow

682
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:12,590
Time on that one time on this one. What was it? Why when did I put it in nine minutes left? Okay

683
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:44,170
I don't want to make a fucking mess faster faster. What the fuck? This is frosting

684
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:47,699
vanilla frosting

685
01:55:47,699 --> 01:55:59,090
This doesn't look like frosting

686
01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:11,159
Did I do too much fucking water again? I did a teaspoon. I did it this time. It had one and a half. You saw me

687
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:14,579
No, no, no, no, no. No, this is this is reducing

688
01:56:15,159 --> 01:56:20,220
Hey, this is this is reducing. There's another one of those cooking words that they say on Food Network

689
01:56:20,779 --> 01:56:44,720
Yeah, okay. This is no look at it. Yeah, it's thickening up time on that. You're going too fast

690
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:56,020
You know, I need to I'm fucking knock this out of the way. Should I give it a taste?

691
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:58,600
What is it? What is it? What's it? What's it supposed to taste like?

692
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:03,659
Frosting. Yeah, this is looking like a glaze

693
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:10,770
Yeah, it looks alright. It's supposed to

694
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:13,489
Span that person

695
01:57:13,489 --> 01:57:17,909
Ban that person, you know who you are and you know what you said ban them

696
01:57:17,909 --> 01:57:22,850
I don't want to see their face ever again. I don't want to ever even I don't want to even hear them in this chat

697
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:28,060
You know what you said and you know who you are. Now you fucking being like holy shitty and talking about me

698
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:47,960
Yeah, ban them for at least a week. Maybe you'll learn your lesson. What do we got for time on that eight more minutes?

699
01:57:47,960 --> 01:58:01,270
No, it's not. It's like four. All right. This is ready. This is nice and mixed. It's got a nice honey glaze

700
01:58:01,909 --> 01:58:04,329
Consistency, it's nice gonna be a nice drizzle on our cake

701
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:25,369
What else do I have here? Oh look at this shit, but I don't like have I need to like or

702
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:31,569
Wait, what about the pretzels? Should I make the pretzels? I can make a pretty so I'm gonna make a huge pretzel

703
01:58:31,829 --> 01:58:40,590
Yep. No who wants to eat these? Yeah, I'm gonna make a big pretzel. It's that one right there

704
01:58:43,020 --> 01:59:02,670
Okay, I have this bowl. I have one two three three clean bowls time on that. Please. There's a time. No, what do you mean?

705
01:59:02,829 --> 01:59:15,819
Hold on. Are we ready to reveal it? It's six minutes back to mixing

706
01:59:16,319 --> 01:59:30,279
This is gonna be gross and a lot of people are gonna be grossed out by this

707
01:59:30,279 --> 01:59:40,119
I guarantee you I have diarrhea in like three hours. I guarantee you think that's just a hot 100%

708
01:59:40,399 --> 02:00:01,159
Time on that up. This thing freaks me out man. This thing freaks me the fuck out. Is this glue? No, it's

709
02:00:04,909 --> 02:00:12,050
It's too thin. It's a no, maybe it's not maybe it's supposed to be like a

710
02:00:12,529 --> 02:00:24,989
Like a nice little drizzle or something add more powder fine

711
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:47,819
I'll add a little bit more powder fine. That's enough put it down. Actually not a bad idea

712
02:00:47,819 --> 02:01:01,020
That's it's starting to really thicken up a little bit here. You want to talk about peak inefficiency, by the way an entire

713
02:01:02,539 --> 02:01:12,260
Two-two full packets of chocolate powder just 80% of it gone and there's one little dollop in there

714
02:01:12,279 --> 02:01:22,939
Just absolute inefficiency. There's not you can't get more inefficient than what just happened

715
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:28,590
Although hold on a minute. I did put a big spoonful of my mouth from the beginning

716
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,109
So that was it that was one cake

717
02:01:30,109 --> 02:01:36,840
I did one full cake in my mouth in the beginning and then I did like at least two cakes full licking it off of

718
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:44,500
My hands, right? So it wasn't a total waste maybe half of it 50% in efficiency. So I got an F still enough

719
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:56,550
All right. Yeah, that's definitely what it's supposed to be like. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

720
02:01:56,550 --> 02:02:07,270
Oh, yeah, there we go. Maybe even a little bit more take it out. Take it out. Take it out

721
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:11,220
How long has it been isn't it too long? All right, I'm gonna get it

722
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:17,340
I'm gonna get it out. How long has been take it out take it out. Oh shit. Hold on

723
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:24,859
I'm almost I gotta get a little thing. So it's too hot for me. It's burning. It's not fucking burning

724
02:02:24,859 --> 02:02:42,649
Quit freaking me out. You guys are fucking with me. Is it out? Oh, dude

725
02:02:43,090 --> 02:03:01,529
It actually looks pretty good. It actually looks kind of good. Take a look at this like I saw the bot

726
02:03:01,689 --> 02:03:18,920
Okay, here it comes. Why is it such a pain in the ass to get out? Okay, hold on

727
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,920
I gotta get it out of there now

728
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:50,840
Get out of there get up give it to me. Oh my fucking

729
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,319
God

730
02:03:53,319 --> 02:04:16,470
Yet it won't oh, okay. Here comes a big reveal. Take a look at that. Ah

731
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:44,640
Yep, it is puffy. It is crispy and it's ready for the frosting. It smells good. It is a little crispy

732
02:04:44,640 --> 02:05:36,279
Yeah, that's alright though. You know when you

733
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,800
Take out your trash you take your trash out of the trash can the bag and

734
02:05:41,859 --> 02:05:48,619
It's just like one item. That's always just at the very bottom of the trash can and you just look in

735
02:05:48,619 --> 02:05:51,779
You know, you see it there all the time, you know, it's in there, but you don't ever fucking grab it

736
02:05:51,779 --> 02:06:07,220
You don't take it out. This is the item that's just at the bottom of the trash can it's hard as a rock

737
02:06:07,699 --> 02:06:15,270
You ready to hear this? It's gonna be like hard candy. Why what happened? I did I told you it was in there for too long

738
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:36,340
A yummy whoopie pie. Holy shit. This is good. This is good way better than the pizza

739
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:50,319
Oh, dude, don't go rules dude. Don't go rules, dude. Are you kidding me? It's don't go rules

740
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:56,300
It's exactly like don't go rules. I wish I made a hundred of these you get

741
02:06:56,300 --> 02:07:01,460
Yeah, fuck this you buy you get one of these don't do this make a bunch of this shit

742
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:05,500
Make the frosting don't even put the frosting on don't make the whoopie pie make don't go rules break up into little crunchy pieces

743
02:07:05,579 --> 02:07:15,890
Holy shit, that's perfect. Well, I wish I had more

744
02:07:16,689 --> 02:07:19,420
Then the joke from the Disney

745
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:27,659
Donald's goofy and Mickey Mouse cartoon where they were sharing one single bean and slicing it off like bread

746
02:07:27,659 --> 02:07:32,739
I don't know Jack and the beanstalk. What is it called? What was that? What was that? What was it called?

747
02:07:32,739 --> 02:07:45,500
It was a Jack and the Beanstalk. They were slicing one bean like a bread. It was bread. Wait, was it bread?

748
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:51,560
Oh, no, they had they were slicing bread like paper thin. What was the bean? No, they did it to a bean too

749
02:07:51,760 --> 02:08:02,189
Okay, let's make a pretzel. Mmm. I think I'm I got I got clean bowls here

750
02:08:02,189 --> 02:08:09,720
Let's see what it takes. Let me make sure I get this ready to go. I enjoyed my I enjoyed

751
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:23,829
Yeah delicious delicious free sample at the mall now. Let's uh that for what I had though. That was really good

752
02:08:23,829 --> 02:08:25,159
You know, it's suck

753
02:08:25,159 --> 02:08:28,880
So bad is that's so good and the free sample of the ball is always so good

754
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:36,220
But then when you actually get the food, it's not so good when you take that free sample that they oh here free sample

755
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:38,779
And you're like, hmm, holy shit. This is I'm this is best thing I've ever had in my life

756
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:44,369
You get the actual entree that that is it's like a 7 out of 10. I hate that shit

757
02:08:44,409 --> 02:08:50,310
It's so annoying like I just I want to buy the tray like I want to go up to the people that have the trays

758
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:54,560
Of the samples and be like can I order can I just buy the tray now from you?

759
02:08:54,560 --> 02:09:05,859
I'll pay twice for what the actual entree is for that's a that's a psychopath test. All right. Well, then I'm a psycho

760
02:09:05,859 --> 02:09:17,819
Whatever. This is gonna go. I still got water here, which is good. Probably gonna need it

761
02:09:17,819 --> 02:09:27,149
I can clean that up. Let's do the pretzel. It's because the sample people don't know how to do it

762
02:09:27,149 --> 02:09:35,689
What do you mean chug the frosting? No, no, I'll shit my pants

763
02:09:35,729 --> 02:10:10,390
I really will I feel like I'm about to take like medicine something about it. I can't I can't do it

764
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:16,119
I can't do something about it. I can't do that something about it

765
02:10:16,119 --> 02:10:23,899
So I can't do it something about how that is that I want it

766
02:10:23,899 --> 02:10:30,199
If you know if you put that in a Dunkaroos container, I'll eat it. It's not a dunker

767
02:10:30,199 --> 02:10:40,109
It's not in a Dunkaroos container. No, I keep trying. I keep trying to just psych myself out and do it. It's just sugar

768
02:10:40,510 --> 02:10:58,069
What's the problem? It's fucking fine. It's sugar. No, it's not. Yes. It is. Just fuck up. It's fine. It's not fine

769
02:10:58,109 --> 02:11:12,869
It's gross actually is kind of gross without the Dunkaroos aspect of it. All right, let's go trash container right here

770
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:18,539
We'll move this out of the way for now. I'll have to clean this up later. All right, it's time for pretzel

771
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:24,670
It's pretzel. Hopefully pretzels not that hopefully you don't need a bunch of bullshit for the pretzel turn the oven off

772
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:28,100
Okay, fine. I

773
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:33,850
Am going to try my hardest and we've been here for a couple hours for two three hours

774
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:39,869
I'm going to try as hard as I can to make this the way that it looks on the actual package

775
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:44,319
Like I'm I have to do one that look that is correct

776
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:49,460
Have to if I'm gonna prove anything here. I need to be ready

777
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:58,760
I need I want to brush my teeth so bad clean the tray

778
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:03,800
I will let me just see what the damage is here. This isn't this is an elaborate one. It's got like holy shit

779
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,880
This is so he's so many packets in here. Oh

780
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:11,439
boy

781
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:16,949
Okay, this is just salt. This is egg wash

782
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,920
nacho cheese sauce

783
02:12:22,659 --> 02:12:31,869
Pretzel mix two pretzel mixes is there three? Okay. Am I ready for this?

784
02:12:32,430 --> 02:12:39,119
Let me at least hold on. Let me at least get these other bowls because I'm gonna need one two

785
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:45,229
Three four one, two, three. I'm gonna need four bowls. Let me clean this one out and let me wash this tray

786
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:50,560
my mother's probably

787
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,340
Freaking out right now

788
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:59,819
You know, you guys like a backseat game, you know both backseat gamers on twitch. My mother is loves to bake

789
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:03,819
She's really into it. She is probably backseat gaming right now

790
02:13:03,819 --> 02:13:10,840
So hard like I I did like I fell off the cliff like four times to my mother right now right now

791
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:12,760
She's just like what is he doing with his hands?

792
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:14,319
No, what do you what are you dumb?

793
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:21,539
Like he's he are you are you pretending to not know how to do this Jeremy? And she's like, oh my I just said that

794
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:40,329
All right. Do I need what do I need for pretzel nuggets? No, I'm doing the loop. All right, I can do this one

795
02:13:40,329 --> 02:13:43,359
Let me clean up the area. Let me clean this out

796
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:53,000
Try as hard as I can for this like this is you think that you like me trying to beat like Jevil for the first

797
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,880
Take the first try. No, I'm gonna get this first try. I'm gonna try as hard as I can

798
02:13:56,039 --> 02:14:02,439
I'm gonna be fucking silent try harding the whole time. I'm gonna be dead silent

799
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,039
quiet I

800
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:09,289
Said I'm gonna be silent try harding this because I want to be sure I get at the first try

801
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:17,699
These are just gonna have to be cleaned later because that shit ain't gonna happen right now

802
02:14:31,869 --> 02:14:37,760
Speed run speed run easy big oven. That's not gonna work. You're sweating. I know I'm sweating

803
02:14:38,439 --> 02:14:45,939
Wouldn't you be in this scenario? If you want me think about it

804
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:50,579
There's over 11,000 people here watching me not be able to do children's baking toy

805
02:14:50,779 --> 02:14:53,100
Do you don't think that you would be sweating just a little here?

806
02:14:53,460 --> 02:15:11,819
There is like a baseball stadium full of people watching me like burn cupcakes. It's good

807
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:38,369
It's just sugar Jeremy, don't worry, it's not gonna hurt you

808
02:15:39,449 --> 02:15:53,319
Ego maniac and then I will return in

809
02:15:54,279 --> 02:16:16,090
Two minutes I'll be back in one or two minutes to keep going we eat this we eat this shit

810
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:24,760
We eat this this we eat this we shouldn't be eating this stuff

811
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:29,220
We shouldn't be eating this just to get a juice or a juice kale

812
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:32,200
Cucumbers and like pineapples and shit. Don't eat this stuff

813
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:11,379
I still taste the marinara sauce

814
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:23,700
Even after eating like two other things I can still taste it. It's like embedded into my gums

815
02:20:24,139 --> 02:20:31,190
Alright, here we go. Time to make the pretzel. I'm gonna make this one count. I'm not gonna fuck around here

816
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:36,420
Pretzel time. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready to give this a fucking hundred percent

817
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:45,409
Alright, let's get this thing cooking. Uh-huh. No, it's try hard time

818
02:20:45,569 --> 02:20:50,600
This is gonna be the best if this is not one of the best pretzels

819
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:56,600
You've ever seen somebody make with an easy bake oven. I will give

820
02:20:56,799 --> 02:21:00,959
I don't know

821
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:03,120
50 subs

822
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:06,030
I'll give you 50 community so I'll give 50 community subs

823
02:21:06,069 --> 02:21:12,270
If this is not like at least like a 5 or 6 out of 10 if this is not a 5 or 6 out of 10

824
02:21:12,270 --> 02:21:24,329
I will promise. Okay. Here we go. That means I'm gonna do this right one egg wash mix. Let's go

825
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:28,180
Let's fucking go. You know what?

826
02:22:54,409 --> 02:22:59,860
Ah, it's too loud for me

827
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:48,489
Don't that's bad. Yeah

828
02:24:49,049 --> 02:24:50,489
next is

829
02:24:50,489 --> 02:25:08,299
Pretzel mix looked over there on that screen and I thought that this bowl was a fire

830
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:10,799
I looked at the preview and I thought that was a fire

831
02:25:11,159 --> 02:25:35,530
If this is this one, I don't like this one. Give me another one. This one's fucked up. No too contaminated

832
02:25:35,809 --> 02:25:50,690
It's like a fucking sandbag. Come on

833
02:25:51,290 --> 02:26:30,299
This

834
02:26:30,579 --> 02:27:00,049
Three four

835
02:27:01,129 --> 02:27:16,000
To a ball

836
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,860
Okay, what kind of pretzel do you want to make? I don't know how to make a pretzel actually

837
02:27:19,860 --> 02:28:50,520
I don't know how to make a pretzel now what it's gonna be good. I need a little I'm what I think anymore water

838
02:28:50,520 --> 02:29:01,270
I don't know. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope

839
02:29:01,549 --> 02:29:28,059
Bingo use a bit more water

840
02:29:28,059 --> 02:29:31,500
I'm only gonna use water just get it a little wet so I can use my hands with it

841
02:29:31,579 --> 02:29:34,200
Just like they do with the fucking restaurants

842
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:56,760
Here we go, is it blood in this am I bleeding? Oh shit, is it? No, I'm not. All right

843
02:31:45,059 --> 02:31:52,430
It's a fish. What are you talking? I haven't even spoken

844
02:31:53,229 --> 02:31:58,969
loud for me

845
02:31:58,969 --> 02:32:13,850
This sucks

846
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:23,059
Get that fucking liquid in there. That's what the problem is

847
02:32:23,059 --> 02:32:26,420
It's not a fucking liquid in there get it in there work it in there go

848
02:32:27,219 --> 02:33:17,040
What's a pretzel do? It's very finicky. Hold on. This one's a much better piece. All right. All right. All right

849
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:25,690
This is this one's this is the one to use fuck this one sucks. This is the one we're using

850
02:33:26,329 --> 02:33:41,319
Okay, here we go. How do you how do you do it?

02:34:15,090 --> 02:34:22,590
Okay, then it goes

855
02:34:22,590 --> 02:34:33,840

He's going crazy. All right, that's good. That's good. That's good. Look at that. What do you think?

857
02:35:22,739 --> 02:35:27,889
What do you think? You're a psycho

858
02:35:28,690 --> 02:35:35,149
That's pretty pogchamp. It is

859
02:35:35,829 --> 02:35:37,790
It actually is

860
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:43,139
Like that's very that's good. This is well done. That's at least a five

861
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,959
That's a fucking five five. That's a goddamn five

862
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:49,670
Ain't that a five?

863
02:35:49,670 --> 02:36:04,969
All right now shut this up. I can't fucking I just did like a monkey. Let's just cook this just because

864
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:30,870
This music doesn't it's fucking freaking me out

865
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:53,430
Bake is this on is it on? No, you don't solve you salt after salt after you don't solve yet

866
02:36:53,430 --> 02:37:00,799
you salt after make the glaze make the dough glaze it and then

867
02:37:01,479 --> 02:37:04,940
Make the cheese

868
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:08,649
salt it salt now

869
02:37:09,370 --> 02:37:11,100
Salt it now

870
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:26,680
Should I should I actually solve the directions? Don't say anything about salt. I don't see anything about salt. Oh shit

871
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:28,680
Yeah, it does. Okay, I gotta be careful

872
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:49,520
That's that's fine. That's not none of that. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's not that's that's perfect

873
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,600
All right, get it in the oven

874
02:37:51,600 --> 02:38:51,219
Here we go. It's too big. Come on. Don't do this to me now. All right, get it in there 12 minutes

875
02:38:51,739 --> 02:38:59,350
The shits on right?

876
02:40:01,299 --> 02:40:24,659
Death

877
02:40:30,049 --> 02:40:36,049
The rest of these look real complicated I'm willing to open them and see we've already done this one fuck this thing

878
02:40:36,409 --> 02:40:46,100
I'm giving I'm giving this thing to my niece. Anyways, she's gonna. Oh wait the cheese sauce. What about the cheese sauce, dude?

879
02:40:46,579 --> 02:40:56,010
Make the cheese dip. No, I don't want to make that. You know how bad this is gonna smell

880
02:40:56,010 --> 02:41:06,770
I refuse to make this just the smell alone from opening this would would probably make me gag

881
02:41:06,930 --> 02:41:16,649
Dermot's the worst uncle but a free easy bake oven with some fucking cool toys and some awesome recipes

882
02:41:16,649 --> 02:41:30,670
This makes me a bad uncle. What are you smoking? Keep an eye on that. That's bread in there. We're making bread tonight

883
02:41:30,670 --> 02:41:40,190
All right. Well, I mean it might as well. Yep. That's exactly what I thought it was gonna be

884
02:41:40,229 --> 02:41:44,579
You know the inside, you know the Kraft macaroni and cheese the cheese packet

885
02:41:44,659 --> 02:42:08,479
We're gonna be eating this shit in ten years. Anyway, 20 years from now real foods are gonna be

886
02:42:09,159 --> 02:42:15,059
Hard to come by like digging a powdered food is gonna be the actually what we're eating that in bugs

887
02:42:15,719 --> 02:42:28,899
Fifty years from now, we're gonna be eating bugs and powdered milk. Okay, just one with two teaspoons water. That's true. Yeah

888
02:42:28,899 --> 02:42:43,350
I know I'm completely aware time what we got for a time. It must be 12 minutes everything

889
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:51,040
Why is everything 12 minutes too, right? That's it. Maybe one little bit

890
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:57,540
Yeah, maybe if I didn't have such huge ass balls

891
02:42:57,739 --> 02:43:06,239
This wouldn't be a problem because all I'm effectively doing is just getting it all over the place

892
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:09,979
This is supposed to be a cheese sauce

893
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:30,250
Why did I open the why did I open this package? Why did I open the package? Why did I open this package? It stinks

894
02:43:30,729 --> 02:43:43,159
This is not even a sauce. This is more like a solid than it is a sauce. I just fucked it up

895
02:43:43,159 --> 02:44:01,760
I just fucking ruined it. Would you eat this? Would you eat this? Would you eat it?

896
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:19,670
I mean it kind of is like a dip. It's supposed to be a cheese

897
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:29,579
I can't even fucking imagine man going to like a Super Bowl party. Well, what do you got there? Oh, well

898
02:44:30,299 --> 02:44:36,299
We've got cheese dip. Yeah, we've got a little bit of gravy left from Thanksgiving last year

899
02:44:36,579 --> 02:44:40,280
we've got a sour dough dough and

900
02:44:40,959 --> 02:44:43,979
Water like that. This is this is not enough

901
02:44:44,559 --> 02:44:51,770
What a feast

902
02:44:51,770 --> 02:44:56,719
Okay, seriously

903
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:01,879
This is the type of shit you get mad when your bowl looks like this when it's still when it comes out of the

904
02:45:01,879 --> 02:45:05,450
Dishwasher like that. It's like fuck man. That's not clean

905
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:16,219
Bullshit, that's unbelievable. This is post dishwasher angry not cheese dip

906
02:45:17,909 --> 02:45:25,520
Speaking of post dishwasher angry. I'm gonna have a lot of fun cleaning this shit up. I don't want to eat this

907
02:45:25,719 --> 02:45:39,690
What's the time cheese dick? This is oh

908
02:45:40,209 --> 02:45:56,590
Can you imagine like being in line at lunch it's like nachos is on the menu Wow nachos we never have nachos

909
02:45:57,229 --> 02:45:59,590
Little lunch ladies. Just like yeah

910
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:28,180
Okay, who's next for the cheese that's when you just skip and you just go to the fucking meatball sub add more water

911
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:41,120
I need time on that. You thought you thought I was gonna do it. Oh that I didn't even know how it happened

912
02:46:41,159 --> 02:46:44,510
It's like I was holding a bug in my hand and I looked down and it was gone

913
02:46:44,510 --> 02:47:01,129
It just freaked me out because I didn't know what the bug was four minutes cool

914
02:47:01,770 --> 02:47:07,440
This is no, this is probably the Lunchables cheese. I think is probably better than this

915
02:47:37,309 --> 02:47:42,709
How has it become less is what I don't understand how did it's dip it's

916
02:47:43,350 --> 02:48:07,200
Disappearing should I should I go for it? No earwax. Oh now I now you know, I can't do it

917
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:22,579
I'm taking it out. Why is every single one of these?

918
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:26,739
Let me give me give you a rundown of what the last three hours has been the last three hours has been I

919
02:48:27,299 --> 02:48:33,399
make this gross shit and then sit there over the course of three recipes and

920
02:48:34,239 --> 02:49:03,700
Try to eat a huge amount of the gross thing. I've done it like four times. You gotta go all in still there

921
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:18,170
That was the grossest thing. I think I've done in probably the last five years. I'm not even kidding

922
02:49:18,170 --> 02:49:19,969
That's probably the gross thing. I've done in the last three years

923
02:49:19,969 --> 02:49:25,920
Does it taste like cheese it tastes?

924
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:34,219
Like I feel like a cat just puked in my mouth and then somebody just sprayed

925
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:44,040
Like I can't believe it's not butter up my nose. That's kind of what it feels like. Is it ready?

926
02:49:44,479 --> 02:50:06,149
It's ready. Is it time one minute. I'll tell you guys a story of how I

927
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:11,909
Never in my whole life. I've ever puked from looking at food or smelling food

928
02:50:11,909 --> 02:50:16,989
I really haven't I haven't but one time I did one time

929
02:50:17,270 --> 02:50:22,879
there was in the so my mother made eggs and bacon and like a breakfast spread, right and

930
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:28,959
After a few hours, you know, obviously it's like, okay, like it's clean it up put it everything in the sink and

931
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:34,000
Okay, we've got like there were there were dirty plates in there because we didn't have a dishwasher

932
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,200
at the time, I don't think and

933
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:45,340
in the sink with all like the dirty kind of breakfast plates was this one dirty plate that had eggs on it still just

934
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:48,149
like curdled up

935
02:50:48,149 --> 02:50:54,620
Scrambled eggs wet and cold and it smelled like gross eggs and I threw up like I threw up directly

936
02:50:54,899 --> 02:51:07,879
Into the sink on top of the eggs is the only times ever happen. Oh shit. No, I puked from Oreos, but no

937
02:51:07,879 --> 02:51:13,379
I was sick though. That's a lie. It's not a lie. I was sick though. I was not sick for this story

938
02:51:13,379 --> 02:51:17,559
That's not a that's a that's not a fake story. It's a real story. All right, here we go. You ready?

939
02:51:17,559 --> 02:52:15,760
That's I wish I had some cheese dip. Ah shit. Ah, fuck. It's so bad. It smells rotten

Oh boy, I want to take a bite of this the cheese is kind of fucking me up. Oh, why did I eat that?

948
02:53:28,190 --> 02:53:37,479

949
02:53:37,479 --> 02:53:38,879
I don't have to do it anymore

02:53:38,879 --> 02:53:45,879
Okay, that's not good. Wait, listen to my voice. Did you hear this? This is bucket. I don't move nobody move

951

Nobody fucking move. This is exactly what I talked about in the past. Nobody fucking move

952
02:53:49,760 --> 02:54:31,840
I need to keep this as long as possible because the cheese it's gone. God damn it. That's not edible

953
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:47,059
That's not edible. It wasn't edible coward. Let's just okay. I can't eat out of the trash

954
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:50,200

Alright, what else is here?

02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:59,909
I I feel like I should give this to my niece and she could actually have fun with it rather than me embarrassed myself

961
02:56:00,190 --> 02:56:05,110
Like I mean, yeah, these are these would be these would be fun for like my niece to do

02:56:25,879 --> 02:56:36,510
Yeah, she does. What who wouldn't want an easy bake oven? Dirty views the dirty bowls

964
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:46,569
This actually was fun though. I had a lot of fun doing this

02:56:46,569 --> 02:56:56,270
I don't think I can physically make another one. I was supposed to do like six we did three

974
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:53,399

984
02:59:43,860 --> 02:59:47,420
There are no Joe Joe's bizarre adventure moves. I can promise you that I

985
02:59:51,850 --> 02:59:56,360
Think if it might limit on easy big oven, that was fun. That was fun

986
02:59:56,680 --> 03:00:03,930
But this is just this is not it's just gross. This is just it's just gross

Your kids will have a lot of fun with it your kids might like it

988
03:00:09,250 --> 03:00:15,510
But then you have to clean up just make sure you have fucking a spit bag over here to like spit your food into

989
03:00:16,870 --> 03:00:19,239
You know what sucks about this I

990
03:00:19,879 --> 03:00:21,879
Am going to think about

991
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:25,639
Why am I doing doing that a lot today? I am going to put your hand on

992
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:28,790
I'm gonna think about eating that ball of cheese

993
03:00:29,629 --> 03:00:33,319
That's never gonna leave my brain. I'm gonna think about it like once or twice a week

994
03:00:33,719 --> 03:00:35,319
I'm gonna be in the shower

995
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:40,790
Just thinking about how it felt going down my throat and I think I'm forever changed

996
03:00:40,790 --> 03:00:46,180
I think I've forever changed because of that. I'm thinking about it right now. Ah

03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:59,920
Mom, I'm sorry. If you're watching
