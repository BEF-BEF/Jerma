00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,050
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with FPS man. This is a

2
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:21,350
First-person free game by the way link is in the description really loud in my ear. It's a first-person pac-man

3
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:29,719
Terrifying adventure. So with that said it's pretty self-explanatory. It's first-person pac-man and here we go

4
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:35,820
I got a mini map in the top right. I should be looking at that. Okay, there's one

5
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:48,909
All right, there's the pac-man Superball I can eat that and all my troubles will be over. Oh, will it?

6
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:53,020
Oh, will it? Oh, will it? Oh, I'm gonna wrap around. We're wrapping around this way

7
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,149
That's a double kill

8
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,770
double kill

9
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,409
Come here you. All right. I'm good to go. Good to go. Good to go. Keep it rolling

10
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,650
Keep it rolling

11
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,930
2,000 points

12
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:22,189
All right. I got another one. I got another one right here. I don't want to just prematurely pick this up

13
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,540
But I think there's a ghost right there. Come on, bro. Oh

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,780
It's two of them. I need to take this opportunity. I got to go this way

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,180
There we are

16
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,579
I'm gonna be level one. Let's hope I beat this

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:55,379
All right, there's a yellow there's a yellow piece of crap. I think I just saw the pink did I I don't know

18
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,700
Horrible I can't go that he's gonna wrap around he's gonna wrap around

19
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,310
Keep going this way. Oh, he's trying to he's trying to close me in

20
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:16,310
Jesus. All right, finish finish that up in this corner turn that corner

21
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:37,939

22
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,550
Yeah, I'm gonna continue this way got to keep going this way. I

23
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,860
Don't have very I think I only have one more of those balls left. I

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,870
think I can only put like one more ball in my mouth before I

25
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:05,270
How long is this level is this really this huge of a level or is pac-man really this big?

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:15,469
Come on. Come on. I want you all to come over here. Come on. Where are they going?

27
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:21,080
What the hell are you guys doing? Come on. All right

28
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,259
See, I this is my last shot right here guys. This is the only last one I can get

29
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,900
This is my last shot right here guys, this is the only last one I can get I gotta get rid of these dudes

30
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:40,979
Gotta kill at least two or three of them. I'll just hopefully I can finish this

31
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:53,270
They're all scattered around the whole damn map. I'm so dead. There's three over here. There's like five over there

32
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:59,340
Damn it. Oh

33
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
I don't

34
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:12,139
Do you have it well what I get 6400 6400

35
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,790
I wish I could hit M and see just how like huge this map really is

36
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,430
Because I feel like it's it's pac-man was not this big

37
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:40,439
Could be wrong though. Damn it. Oh, this is it. It was a yellow one. Let's go again one more time

38
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:47,180
This is it. This is the last try you talk about like jump scares

39
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,490
This game has like this is like this is like scarier than some of the games I've played

40
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:59,980
All right. I got a piece of candy ready. I got like an orbiting piece of bubblegum. I'm ready to take it

41
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:08,069
Let's go this way first one dude over here. Come on. Go the other way. Go the other way. Go the other way

42
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:17,110
Oh you he came from the other side. Someone's gonna come right over here. Yep. Yep, two of them two of them

43
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,680
Two of them. Come on run right into this eat that

44
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,519

00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm gonna beat level one. Come on. I gotta be level one

46
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,149
Turn around wrap around wrap around wrap around. Come on. This is the end right here. This is it

47
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:51,129
I'm gonna do it get that that was not it. There's even more

48
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,290
What did I miss?

49
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:01,639
The whole nother section over here. Are you kidding me? Maybe not. Come on. It's the end

50
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:11,029
This is the end get it. I did it. I beat every level one of FPS man, but that's gonna wrap it up here guys

51
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,550
Thank you so much for watching. This has been FPS man link in the description. It's free

52
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,670
You can go scare the hell out of yourself and try to beat my high score

53
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,410
Which is probably gonna be pretty easy because it was just level one

54
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,110
There's probably some of you guys that are at like level 30 and I beat this whole damn game

55
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,389
But anyways guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it and I'll see y'all next time. Of course, take care everybody
