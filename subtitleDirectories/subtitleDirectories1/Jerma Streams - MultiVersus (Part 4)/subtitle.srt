1
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:10,169
What are you guys betting on? Betting on something? Betting on what?

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:19,000
Predict the coin flip. Oh, it's a coin flip. Free stream coin flip. Okay.

3
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:27,690
Hello. Welcome back, everybody. I wanted to stream yesterday, but I didn't.

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm still kind of dealing with some problems medically, and it's...

5
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,750
We're gonna just take it easy. We're gonna take it slow.

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,659
I'm trying to make sure that by the baseball stream, I'm ready to go.

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,810
I talked a little bit in free stream about it, but there is a lot of stuff going on.

8
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,909
Let's go over... Wait, hold on. I gotta wait for people to get here.

9
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:58,659
Say you're sorry now. No, I'm not going to apologize.

10
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,619
I'm not going to apologize for what? What am I saying sorry for?

11
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,359
No, no apologies. I didn't do anything wrong.

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,980
And I'm getting wicked defensive. I'm getting wicked defensive about it already.

13
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,000
We're worried. Don't... I'm fine. Don't worry. I'll be all right.

14
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,870
Don't be... Don't worry. But here's what's going on today.

15
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,219
Something really cool.

16
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,299
We got a multi versus tournament that I'm going to be participating in.

17
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,569
Ludwig put it together. I think I'm ready to play.

18
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:42,980
That's what we're doing today.

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,420
Tomorrow, still think it's planned to do the Call of Duty thing with myth.

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,500
We'll see how that goes.

21
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,900
If anything's changing, I'll let you know in free stream by tomorrow.

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:05,510
Friday, we're going to play two point campus as a... Excuse me. Sponsor stream.

23
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,490
And then Sunday is green screen movie night part two.

24
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,009
Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,659
Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday. I can guarantee you that.

26
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,620
And then Monday, we're going to do a free baseball hype stream

27
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,800
where I kind of just shout it out a lot, talk about it, hang out for an hour or two.

28
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,699
And then baseball is next week.

29
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,879
That's the plan for this week here.

30
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,259
Please wear the same red sock shirt that you wore last time.

31
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,819
Yeah, there's your plan.

32
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,539
If anything changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.

33
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,560
Wait, baseball is next week. Yes.

34
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,800
Baseball is next week, the 19th of August.

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:24,919
Do you have a Discord update for it? I don't know.

36
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,189
So anyways, we're going to play. I'm going to warm up a little bit.

37
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,780
Play some multiverses. Get ready, because this is a tournament.

38
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,780
I got to be ready for it.

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,770
Happy birthday, Andy.

40
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,400
Is sorcery over? No, of course not.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,000
I just... I was going to be very busy this week into next week.

42
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,210
So when we come back from baseball, we'll do some chill sorcery stuff.

43
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,409
We'll continue part three. Don't worry.

44
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,699
Called the Lamb Mortuary Assistant.

45
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,139
There's stuff that I want to play.

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm just to the brim right now.

47
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,139
You sound like you're going to sell me a vacuum.

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,069
Would it work?

49
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,060
If I held a vacuum up to you right now and I was like, this is $300.

50
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,420
Give me the money. Would you give it to me?

51
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,839
Is this slow pitch softball?

52
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,160
I don't know where you heard softball.

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,680
This is a baseball game.

54
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,620
This is a baseball game.

55
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,819
What do you mean, softball?

56
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,339
This is a baseball game.

57
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,660
We told you that you got wrong information.

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,750
Somebody just ask, what's the difference?

59
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,220
There's a big difference between how softball and baseball is played.

60
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,689
Very slight differences, but there are a lot.

61
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,660
It's the same exact concept.

62
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,810
All right, let me let me do some warm up games.

63
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,529
I got to get this.

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,709
I got to lose to like five people in a row before we get started here.

65
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,230
I don't know when the tournament's starting.

66
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,670
I know it's starting at some point today, the next probably like half hour hour.

67
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,509
I definitely want to at least play a little bit and get ready.

68
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,670
Because I don't want to get embarrassed on this street.

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,230
You know what I mean?

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Let me get in.

71
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:46,620
All right, let's do some.

72
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,490
I'm gonna do some 1v1s to warm up.

73
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,939
Oh, no, I'll do maybe free for all so people don't make fun of me.

74
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,089
No, 1v1, let's go.

75
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:09,370
Move this and hello.

76
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,060
Look at that.

77
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,170
I'll put the cam on in a minute.

78
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,670
All right, who should I play in the tournament?

79
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,470
What do you think?

80
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,660
How many turkeys could you fit in your garage?

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,779
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,459
What a what a weird question.

83
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,420
I was gonna say dumb.

84
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,500
What a dumb question.

85
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,860
Who should I play in the tournament?

86
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
All right, I got a good LeBron.

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,259
I got a good bugs and I got a good Superman.

88
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
We're not testing new characters today.

89
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,540
Should I practice bugs or practice Superman?

90
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,350
I'm not going to play a character I haven't played with.

91
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:02,709
Where's the handsome?

92
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,470
What's the handsome streamer?

93
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,310
I'm working on it.

94
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,730
Please play LeBron.

95
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,649
Well, it depends on who my partner's playing it.

96
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,480
You want the camera?

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,839
Fine.

98
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,569
And it's against Jake right off the bat.

99
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,170
Can't wait to get mad already.

100
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,699
All right, I need to put one on here.

101
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:25,930
That one definitely.

102
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,579
All right, these are practice rounds.

103
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,300
I'm not going to get mad.

104
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,459
I'm not going to get pissed off.

105
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:35,850
This is warm up rounds.

106
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,009
Greasy, Greasy Gary.

107
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,660
Villain hair.

108
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,860
You have copper hair.

109
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,779
It kind of is.

110
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,019
It does look like it's been at a fucking like aluminum.

111
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,129
All right, here we go.

112
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,399
One, two, three, go.

113
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:14,579
What the fuck?

114
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,379
What's going on?

115
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:28,170
That's why I got to warm up.

116
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,810
Warm up around.

117
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,929
What?

118
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

119
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:54,659
Shut up.

120
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:07,559
Dude, what the?

121
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,399
Finally, the guy goes flying.

122
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,360
Took a hundred years.

123
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,639
No, no, no, no, no, no.

124
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,539
Oh, my God, he almost just dropped down on himself.

125
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,009
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

126
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:12,570
All right.

127
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,129
Shake it off.

128
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,690
This first match I played in two weeks.

129
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:16,730
Relax.

130
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
That's the first match I played in two and a half weeks.

131
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,480
Relax.

132
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,899
Your hair is greasier than by McDonald's order.

133
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,840
Yeah, it's because like, dude, what do you think I do in the morning?

134
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:53,879
I go get the vegetable oil and I like, then I just go like, I don't do that.

135
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,279
Don't.

136
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,240
That's a joke.

137
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,779
Please don't actually do that.

138
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:02,580
I believe that.

139
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:02,820
Don't.

140
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,340
Please don't do that.

141
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,340
All right.

142
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,820
We got that.

143
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,299
We got one.

144
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:07,620
We got one.

145
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,340
That was a good match.

146
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,980
It was a good fight.

147
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,399
Let's do some LeBron.

148
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,980
What's up, doc?

149
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,860
Vegetable oil.

150
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,429
Your hair looks like a helmet.

151
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:25,100
It's called getting out of the shower and just letting it dry.

152
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,850
You need to practice bugs.

153
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,049
I got to just get back into the game, man.

154
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,799
Dude, your brain is exposed.

155
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,480
What do you mean?

156
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,360
Like, just right here?

157
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,620
Like, let me hold on.

158
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,019
Let me jump in.

159
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,299
I got to get in my Discord call.

160
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:01,750
I think I'm going Superman.

161
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,950
I think I'm going straight up Superman.

162
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,960
Your hair looks fine.

163
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,360
No, I know.

164
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,529
It's shiny because of the light.

165
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,879
I got a light in my face, man.

166
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,759
All right.

167
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,240
That was a good fight against Jake the dog.

168
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,370
Okay.

169
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,480
I'll probably get this one more in.

170
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,720
All right.

171
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,360
Let's make this a good one.

172
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,759
Here we go.

173
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,000
Ready?

174
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Let me just turn around and not look the other way.

175
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,360
What?

176
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,759
Check this out.

177
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:32,840
Ready?

178
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,559
One, two, three, four, five.

179
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,990
You.

180
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,620
I didn't want to do that.

181
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:45,659
I'm good.

182
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,460
I think I'm warming up now.

183
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,399
What?

184
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,120
Nobody sees that.

185
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,360
Come on.

186
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,759
Give me a break.

187
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,840
Oh, that was pretty risky.

188
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,669
Oh, that would have been good.

189
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,419
Got it.

190
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,470
Oh, come on, Gwen.

191
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:40,470
Oh, that is going to jump.

192
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,909
Taking it to the sky.

193
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:42,230
Sorry.

194
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,470
Sorry.

195
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,710
We're good.

196
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,029
We're good.

197
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,389
We're good.

198
00:16:44,389 --> 00:17:11,500
Shit.

199
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,500
I thought I didn't dodge through that.

200
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,420
Holy shit.

201
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,579
How did I not dodge through the grab?

202
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,940
I dodged through the grab.

203
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,180
What?

204
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,450
That was fucked up.

205
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:32,730
What?

206
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,049
When he went for the grab, I went.

207
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,490
I didn't dodge through it.

208
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,009
I lost it pretty hard at the end there.

209
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:46,740
Sorry.

210
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,539
You actually threw?

211
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,430
No, I just got combo'd.

212
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,309
Too much grease.

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Here comes the heat.

214
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,789
It was the I-Frames.

215
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,670
That was weird.

216
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,190
I seriously thought I went right through.

217
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,319
That threw me off.

218
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:05,720
I think.

219
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,259
Wait, hold on.

220
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:08,579
Wait, wait.

221
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:10,180
I got to put friend code stuff in.

222
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,500
Hold on.

223
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,380
Dude, it used to be good.

224
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,099
What happened?

225
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,779
This is the second game I played in three weeks.

226
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:25,740
Ban that person for 700 days.

227
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,140
What up?

228
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,180
Let's see if you can...

229
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,140
Can we hear Connor?

230
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,460
Hello.

231
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,099
Can you hear me?

232
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,420
By the way, guys, Connor eats pants as the teammate.

233
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,980
Big reveal.

234
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,660
Hello, it's me.

235
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,420
Did they not know?

236
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,779
Did they not know that until now?

237
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,819
I don't think so.

238
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,259
I think some people do, but not everybody.

239
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,140
It was a secret.

240
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,940
It was a big secret.

241
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,440
So who do you play with?

242
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,880
I play Tom and Jerry and I can play LeBron, Iron Giant.

243
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,720
I can play a good bit of people, I think.

244
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,400
I just lost two games in a row warming up.

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,559
I haven't played in like three weeks, though, so that's all right.

246
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,039
That's fine.

247
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:00,680
That's good.

248
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,279
Oh, how's it going, gentlemen?

249
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,160
God, I thought that was you.

250
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,079
Yeah.

251
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,680
Connor, I thought you changed voices.

252
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,480
I was like, what happened?

253
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,559
What's up, man?

254
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,119
Not much.

255
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,799
I made a song today.

256
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,599
Yeah, you were working on a music career, right?

257
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,559
Uh-huh.

258
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,319
And I'm proud of it.

259
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,680
And that's all.

260
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,720
So it was a great day for me.

261
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,009
Yeah, we're talking strategy.

262
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,650
FL player, it's a whole thing.

263
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,529
But anyway, I just need one of you guys to Discord stream if possible.

264
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:34,410
Just so I can see.

265
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,289
It's also OK.

266
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,250
It's super impossible, but I thought I'd throw it out there.

267
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,559
Every time I've tried to do that, it crashes my OBS.

268
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,039
It sucks.

269
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,640
Terma, that's bad for you.

270
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,519
Connor, what about you?

271
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,200
Surely this won't crash my OBS.

272
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
Surely not.

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,309
I got to get your friend code or friend name, Connor.

274
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:56,630
Oh, yeah.

275
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,390
Bunch of friend names in general, Chad, that you should add as well.

276
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,430
One sec.

277
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,259
Wait, there's friend codes or just names?

278
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,539
I think it's just names, right?

279
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,140
Your WB name.

280
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,640
So should we be adding everybody?

281
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,200
He left.

282
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,599
I don't know.

283
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,420
He went to go hang out with his more popular friends.

284
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,180
Let me add you.

285
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,940
He went to go talk to Psychuno.

286
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:24,230
All right.

287
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,509
My name is Scarlet Otter something.

288
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:28,549
You'll see it.

289
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,069
Scarlet Otter something?

290
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:30,630
It's something weird.

291
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
He could get one free name change.

292
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:36,569
Do you really?

293
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,089
I think so.

294
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,690
I send you a request and then I'm going to...

295
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,569
Should I add you to a party?

296
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,730
Should we be together in a party?

297
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,089
I don't know.

298
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,630
Oh, I see Scarlet Otter.

299
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,940
There we go.

300
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,420
OK, cool.

301
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:57,880
Yeah, someone took my username.

302
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,200
So I had to be Connor from Dream SMP instead.

303
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,329
Why is it recommending me Shaggy?

304
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,329
Like I just downloaded the game 10 minutes ago.

305
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,089
Try out this.

306
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,369
You must have some bad games.

307
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,769
It was like you should try out this guy instead.

308
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,569
I did all right.

309
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:16,250
I did OK.

310
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,650
I love it.

311
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,210
Do you like this game?

312
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,009
You having fun?

313
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,049
I think it's super cool.

314
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:19,690
I like it a lot.

315
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:22,660
Play Rhyme Dog.

316
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
No, if we play Rhyme Dog, no one's going to watch us.

317
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,420
They're going to be like, oh, these guys play Rhyme Dog.

318
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,460
No one cares.

319
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,019
All right, shoot.

320
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:28,579
Who's going to leave?

321
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,220
Superman or Bugs?

322
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,720
What do you think?

323
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,680
Which one do you like more?

324
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:33,980
I don't know.

325
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,579
I feel like I like Bugs, but I feel like OK, we're going with Bugs.

326
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,140
So now I think we have to change to like a custom game, right?

327
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,619
I don't know.

328
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,299
Do we practice or do we just immediately jump into it?

329
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,859
Let's see what Lubbock says.

330
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:55,259
I got my tea.

331
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:56,680
Are you a tea?

332
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,720
Yeah, green tea.

333
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,990
I don't have any green tea.

334
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,789
Green tea.

335
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm going to be honest.

336
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,779
I was going to do like I was going to plan a funny bit for you.

337
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,660
Like you'd have like some funny jokes where I was going to put like

338
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,819
Tom and Jerry sound effects on the soundboard.

339
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,859
Oh, that would have been pretty funny.

340
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,779
And then it turns out I misplanned my timing for this.

341
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,559
And I thought this started in an hour.

342
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,440
And so I was I was actually doing my one like contractual dream SMP thing

343
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,579
for like a month for a little bit.

344
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,500
Well, I promise you I don't have it.

345
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,940
I have literally no gags ready for this stream.

346
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,059
I don't have any none.

347
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,200
OK, so I have zero too.

348
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, none.

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,160
OK, we'll think of it.

350
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,359
If you think of something like, you know, like give a hint.

351
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,960
And I'll like try to we all hit the layup like we'll we'll make a joke.

352
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,579
If we win a game, I need you to say something.

353
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,420
OK, I'll think of something like.

354
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,099
Do you have a good Bugs Bunny impression?

355
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:58,839
That's pretty good.

356
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,470
It's like a bug.

357
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,029
That was that kind of bugs with his arms in the air like, yeah, whatever.

358
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,039
OK, because if we win a game, we both have to say like, yeah, what's up, doc?

359
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,640
At the same time, it's very important.

360
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,559
Yeah, it's incredibly annoying.

361
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,720
We have to go and join their voice call immediately.

362
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:25,900
I'm not going to leak anything, but that's very important that we do that.

363
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Don't tell anyone or else they're going to kill us.

364
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,579
Don't tell anybody about sportsmanship.

365
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,319
I could should we do like just a warm up round?

366
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,279
Yeah, let's let's go on.

367
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,880
Let's just do a random team online.

368
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,519
Let's see how it goes.

369
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
I think we're on it already.

370
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,079
Watch us do that.

371
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,200
And they're like, hey, we guys out.

372
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:42,980
That's what always happens.

373
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,240
You played Fortnite, the Ludwig Fortnite thing, right?

374
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,319
Yeah, that's the first time I've ever installed Fortnite.

375
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,400
That's awesome.

376
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,220
I don't know if the Fortnite Friday sometime.

377
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,140
Is it fun?

378
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:56,890
I love Fortnite.

379
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,369
I think it's the best game.

380
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,009
Do you OK?

381
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:00,809
Is that you?

382
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,730
Do you ironically but unironically like it's a really fun game?

383
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,009
Like if you just if you just enjoy it casually with friends.

384
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,200
OK, and it's also just cool because like you just start seeing

385
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,920
so many different characters and you're like, oh, here's Goku.

386
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,079
And then there's like LeBron James.

387
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,160
And then there's, you know, Will Smith.

388
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,480
And I made this reference a while back.

389
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,680
Remember the old Smash Brothers Brawl character leaks?

390
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,559
Yeah, that is Fortnite.

391
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,119
Like the one that's just like a giant JPEG.

392
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,640
You can't even tell like what the characters are.

393
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,519
Yeah, the one with the one with like fucking Al Bundy on it.

394
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah, it's like that's what Fortnite is now.

395
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,380
Yep.

396
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,099
Fortnite's great.

397
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,859
All right, let's go for it.

398
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:42,579
Get a warm up here.

399
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,279
Oh, man.

400
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,180
So did they change the characters yet so far?

401
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,539
Or I think I think they've done some nerfs and some buff.

402
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,069
OK, surely someone in chat knows.

403
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:03,619
Is that you or was that actually Buck?

404
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:06,500
It's just me.

405
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,859
I could be honest, I almost just lost this point.

406
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,029
It's fine.

407
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,829
We beat these guys.

408
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,579
There's no way you can lose to a guy named FiercedDayMantis333.

409
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:22,460
That's like.

410
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,859
Are you sure?

411
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:24,220
FiercedDayMantis taken.

412
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,099
I mean, my name is Scarlet Otter.

413
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,380
That's just like the default Xbox name.

414
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,740
Oh, it must just be a default name.

415
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,240
Yeah.

416
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,809
Oh, we're so much better, though.

417
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:40,519
Stop it.

418
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,759
Back me coming in.

419
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,069
Oh, that's actually pretty sweet.

420
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:50,380
Oh, he's there's no way he's going to make it.

421
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,180
We're so much better.

422
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,759
What do you play in Smash Bros. usually?

423
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,319
Lucas.

424
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, OK.

425
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
But I mean, I don't play Smash Bros. anymore.

426
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,019
I stopped playing pretty much.

427
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,940
Yeah, I want your opinion on this.

428
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,180
Because everyone thinks I'm a nutcase for saying this.

429
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,339
So the new Smash Bros. since after Brawl,

430
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,259
it started doing this thing that I just can't get over.

431
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,460
And people go, what are you talking about?

432
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,380
Until they actually pay attention the next time I play it.

433
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,099
There are so many fucking particle effects in the new games

434
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,539
that I can't even tell who's playing the game.

435
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,339
Particle effect?

436
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,420
It's just when you when you hit anybody, when you move,

437
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,339
when you when you do a move, when you jump,

438
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,940
it's just like explosions of like purple green

439
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,859
and like orange colors all over the whole screen.

440
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,920
You'll notice it next time you play.

441
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,160
Um, 20.

442
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,279
Oh, OK.

443
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:47,839
Yeah.

444
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,519
It starts to get that way once you get that edge.

445
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,099
I'm telling you, I'm going to.

446
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:54,380
People are going to start to pay attention.

447
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,220
I believe you.

448
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,619
I thought you were just going to say because like Melee is better.

449
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,059
I was like, yeah, no, you're right.

450
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,299
No, but if you watch like Melee and then watch the new ones.

451
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,799
True.

452
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,200
You watch Melee and you're like, wow, this game looks great.

453
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,480
But there's not a bunch of like.

454
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm telling you, I put on frame by frame on stream

455
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
of somebody doing a single attack.

456
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,200
In Smash Brothers.

457
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,759
And everyone was like, question marks, question marks.

458
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:21,000
And I saw like at least two to three hundred trues.

459
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,079
That's the worst is when like, you know, you're right

460
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,400
and everybody keeps question mark spamming anyways.

461
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,680
Like, like what I know, I'm right.

462
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't need like their opinion and they're just question

463
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,519
marking just to be different.

464
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,190
I like Smash Brothers, though.

465
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,309
I think the game is fantastic.

466
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,069
I just I don't know.

467
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:44,039
It's like too much, especially when you play with more than one one v one.

468
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,000
It's just like, I don't even know what's what's even going on.

469
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,640
Yeah.

470
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,920
Yeah, I I've got my own opinions on Smash Brothers.

471
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,640
But if I get into it, I'll be talking for ranting for like an hour.

472
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,240
We got a link.

473
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,250
We got to let this run out off on generals.

474
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,650
I think they're starting to go in general.

475
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,170
All right, let's go, Joe.

476
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,289
Wait, can I give a speech?

477
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,589
I will be right now if you want.

478
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:09,069
I can.

479
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:09,869
Is that a sheep?

480
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,910
No, I will be shuffling the seating.

481
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,190
You will find out who you are playing in this event in just a few moments.

482
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,039
First seed place, eighth seed, so on.

483
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
It is a double elimination tournament.

484
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
So if you lose, you're not out unless you lose twice.

485
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,519
Then then you're out.

486
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,799
Get the hell out.

487
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,609
Should I back out right now?

488
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,569
It doesn't super matter.

489
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,089
But just listen to what I'm saying.

490
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:34,809
What, dude?

491
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,170
Okay, what's up?

492
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,650
You're fine.

493
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,289
You're fine.

494
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,849
It is an eight person double elimination bracket with fifteen thousand dollars

495
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,089
of prize money on the line out of my pocket.

496
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,430
Yes, eight thousand dollars for first place.

497
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,309
Four thousand each.

498
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,069
Five thousand for second place.

499
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,029
Two thousand five hundred each.

500
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:57,099
And then a final third place match for two thousand dollars total.

501
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:58,400
One thousand each.

502
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,720
Nice.

503
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,200
All right.

504
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,799
So fifteen thousand paid out net seven hundred thirty five days.

505
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,279
And what we're going to do right now is shuffle the seating to see who you are all playing

506
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,089
real quick before we jump in.

507
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:16,089
Do not start your next match even if your opponent's ready until I tell you.

508
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,170
So we're going to do all the matches at the same time.

509
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,809
If that makes sense.

510
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,650
So some people I need to catch up.

511
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,089
I'll just put it in the general chat.

512
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,329
Seating is now getting shuffled.

513
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,369
I'm sharing it on Discord.

514
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,410
You guys want to take a look?

515
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,200
I want to take a look.

516
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
I want to take a look.

517
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,559
Hop in hop because I'm doing click the button right now.

518
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,119
Okay, where are you playing?

519
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,599
You have to go.

520
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,519
Seating has been finalized.

521
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,119
Oh, the big dogs.

522
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,000
Here are the matchups.

523
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,839
You guys can enter your own Discord call, but this is who you need to match up against.

524
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,880
It is Stans versus Alpharad or Stans and Alpharad versus Asan and Esewa.

525
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,599
That's match up one.

526
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,799
You guys can now go to your Discords.

527
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,960
Oh, here we fucking go, dude.

528
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,880
Do we all get into the same Discord?

529
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,319
Do we all get into the same Discord?

530
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,880
You can if you want to set it up and then go back to your own.

531
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,799
But when you're playing, just be in your own Discord

532
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,519
and make sure to also be Discord sharing your gameplay.

533
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,640
What if your Discord chat is full of people who won't stop talking in your ear?

534
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,880
Then that's a mod problem.

535
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,319
Next up is Dock and Sheep.

536
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,240
You guys are going to be playing Lily and Michael.

537
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,880
So Dock, Sheep will be playing Lily, Michael.

538
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,519
Good luck, good luck.

539
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,400
Best of three, by the way.

540
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,960
Best of three.

541
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,319
Connor, Jerma, you guys are going to be playing Crazy Slick and Jesse.

542
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,319
And finally, TheValeConnell, you are playing Buddha and Saikuno.

543
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,059
All right, I'm going to go off, set up your games, add the friends, get it all going.

544
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,539
I'll add everyone to start in just a few moments.

545
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,019
Thanks, Ludd.

546
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:43,420
Let's do it.

547
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,140
Appreciate it, gamers.

548
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,539
Thank you.

549
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:46,589
Bye.

550
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:46,910
Bye.

551
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,910
All right, so where are we going?

552
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,490
All right, we're against Slick and Jesse.

553
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,690
Oh, OK.

554
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,829
Hey, guys.

555
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:57,329
Hey.

556
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,740
Hey, everybody.

557
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,299
What's happening?

558
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,819
We got to set up a lobby.

559
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,500
So does anyone want to do that here?

560
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,180
Or working on my hands?

561
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,680
See.

562
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,180
Yeah.

563
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,980
Yeah, we'll do that.

564
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,339
OK.

565
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:10,819
OK.

566
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:12,420
What are the rules?

567
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,380
I don't know.

568
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,180
Is it just four?

569
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,170
Did he say best?

570
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,009
Best of three, but what are the maps?

571
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:21,890
I don't get how that works.

572
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,210
Anything?

573
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,089
I don't really know.

574
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,089
Yeah, is it just any map?

575
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:25,589
Random.

576
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:28,660
I don't know.

577
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,619
I'm having a panic attack.

578
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,539
All right, so custom game.

579
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,420
I'll set up custom game.

580
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,900
OK.

581
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,180
And then we're doing 2v2.

582
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,660
Ringouts?

583
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,460
Are we doing four ringouts?

584
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm imagining no time limit, right?

585
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,299
I don't know.

586
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,339
I don't know what the rules are.

587
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,140
Hazards enabled?

588
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,759
I'm going to go over there and see.

589
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,240
Yeah.

590
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,880
OK.

591
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,839
Let's get a clarification.

592
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,880
I'll get a clarification.

593
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
I mean, hopefully I don't bother him.

594
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,220
Let's see.

595
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,250
Going.

596
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,769
Let's get a prediction going.

597
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:53,579
Who wins?

598
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,779
Let's do it specifically, because I

599
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,740
think this was interesting.

600
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,259
Hassan Nessua stands out for it.

601
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:00,059
I think Nessua is the best player in this event.

602
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,980
I think Hassan is the worst player.

603
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,599
He's not better than me.

604
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,079
I got to pee.

605
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll be right back.

606
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,440
Hey.

607
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,079
Oh, he's gone.

608
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,980
Shit.

609
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,420
I missed my opportunity.

610
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,460
I missed my opportunity.

611
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,980
I missed my opportunity to ask him, because he went pee.

612
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:18,740
No way.

613
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,420
Was it embarrassing?

614
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,420
Nobody responded?

615
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,740
Yeah.

616
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,059
All right.

617
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:24,539
We'll get it.

618
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:25,420
I got to get on this team.

619
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,619
So let me add you guys.

620
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,619
Zoom hazards off, and then the Scooby-Doo stage off, maybe?

621
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,819
Probably no time limit either, right?

622
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,140
Yeah, probably.

623
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,059
So no Scooby-Doo stage.

624
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:38,740
OK.

625
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,940
Yeah, no Scooby-Doo.

626
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,660
The mansion is.

627
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,740
Four ring-outs, and then I got to add you guys.

628
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,099
So what do you guys, you guys are going to put it in general, right?

629
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,539
I can invite Slick.

630
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:47,779
OK.

631
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:48,019
Yeah.

632
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,390
I don't see you online, Slick.

633
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,349
I thought I added you.

634
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,940
I see you.

635
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,059
My name is Scarlett Otter, and a bunch of random bullshit.

636
00:32:59,059 --> 00:32:59,859
I'm going to add you.

637
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:05,279
There's already three of those adding me.

638
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,839
So you're going to have to.

639
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,680
Are you serious?

640
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,769
I was going to say, what?

641
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:11,490
Quick.

642
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,779
A lot of Scarlett Otter fans out there.

643
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,019
4366 or 4633?

644
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:25,410
I'm adding you literally right now, and I'm bringing you to the custom game right now.

645
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,839
I just accepted it now.

646
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,079
All right.

647
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,099
You got Slick in here, right?

648
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:31,220
Yeah, I'm in here.

649
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,720
OK.

650
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:33,299
OK.

651
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:33,700
He's back.

652
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,619
You can ask him now, maybe.

653
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,250
I think other people are asking questions, too.

654
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,099
Oh, OK.

655
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:41,819
Really fine.

656
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,619
Works are fine.

657
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:43,569
OK.

658
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,690
Hey, another question here.

659
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,890
Maps.

660
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,440
Are any maps off limits?

661
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,670
People saying Scooby-Doo off limits, or are we just keeping everything in?

662
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,230
I think we go hog wild.

663
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:00,430
Just anything.

664
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,799
In your counterpick.

665
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:05,730
It's a good point, Jeremy.

666
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,009
You brought up a great point.

667
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:08,690
You brought up an excellent point.

668
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,889
There are three maps that are fine.

669
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,369
Keep them all in.

670
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:10,849
Keep them all in.

671
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:11,730
Just keep all maps in?

672
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,130
You got it.

673
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:12,449
All right.

674
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,809
And we fear nothing but God.

675
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,690
And this is unlimited time, no hazards, and four ring outs, right?

676
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,420
Seven minutes for time.

677
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,019
Seven minutes for time, no hazards?

678
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:24,260
Yeah, no hazards.

679
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,900
No hazards.

680
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,219
You got it.

681
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,699
All right.

682
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,099
Cool.

683
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,849
Thanks.

684
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:31,409
All right.

685
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:31,730
We're good.

686
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,289
These are the rules that you see on the screen right now.

687
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,730
And by the way, all maps are in.

688
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,880
OK.

689
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,559
All maps, including Scooby-Doo.

690
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,480
All maps, including Scooby-Doo.

691
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,800
All right.

692
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,400
Are we playing random or what?

693
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,119
All right.

694
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,519
That's what I thought we were playing regulation, but OK.

695
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,360
We'll play Ludwig's Fun Rules.

696
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,960
It's four ring outs, and then?

697
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,079
Seven minutes.

698
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,940
OK.

699
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,420
OK.

700
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,829
But what if both teams decide no Scooby-Doo?

701
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:55,150
That's it.

702
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,619
Are we banning anybody?

703
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,340
I don't think so.

704
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,860
I don't know.

705
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,619
Is there enough people for bans?

706
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,349
People call me Question Andy.

707
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:04,829
I want to go.

708
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:07,309
This is a $15,000 tournament.

709
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:08,829
I don't know if I don't want to screw this up.

710
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:09,389
How much?

711
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:10,269
There's no details.

712
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:11,949
And Ludwig is really bad at running tournaments.

713
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:12,909
I'm going to have to ask him again.

714
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:13,309
I don't know.

715
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,389
Question Andy.

716
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:19,219
Oh, is there announcements?

717
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:19,780
What is this?

718
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,500
All characters?

719
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,139
OK, right here.

720
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,179
All perks are totally fine.

721
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:22,900
All stages.

722
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,739
Loser picks map.

723
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,300
What?

724
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:25,780
Question.

725
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,340
No hazards.

726
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,820
You know.

727
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,940
Dude, shut up.

728
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,500
Seven minutes.

729
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:28,980
Four stocks.

730
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,780
Best of three.

731
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,059
What do you guys play?

732
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:32,179
Loser picks map?

733
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,260
How do we know which one of us is the loser?

734
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,480
Was it random?

735
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,099
They put a loser in that.

736
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,539
Oh, was it just seeded that way?

737
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,900
I guess one of us is the loser.

738
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,659
Wait, I don't think we even pick maps.

739
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:44,139
Do we?

740
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:44,940
I don't think so.

741
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,909
It says loser picks maps.

742
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:47,789
I'm having a panic attack.

743
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:48,190
All right, whatever.

744
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,710
Maybe we don't rematch immediately.

745
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,480
So I'm assuming I'm not the loser.

746
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,440
I don't care about maps.

747
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
But it's like up to you guys.

748
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,760
Like, for real.

749
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,360
It doesn't bother me at all.

750
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,079
Maps don't bother me.

751
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,480
I don't care.

752
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,599
Yeah, I'm fine with whatever.

753
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,000
All right.

754
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,239
Yeah.

755
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:04,480
OK.

756
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,880
All right.

757
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
Well, good luck, guys.

758
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,719
Have fun at all.

759
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,099
Good luck.

760
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:09,780
So are we going to be in the same call?

761
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,900
Like, talking shit?

762
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,219
I think we're going to go separate.

763
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:16,179
Because, I mean, you know, we get in strategies.

764
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,059
Yeah, that's true.

765
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:17,699
That's true.

766
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:17,940
All right.

767
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,500
Good luck, boys.

768
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,219
So many questions.

769
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:19,460
All right.

770
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,019
Have fun, guys.

771
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,019
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

772
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,559
See you guys tomorrow.

773
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,119
Hopefully, I'll see you tomorrow.

774
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,320
What the hell popped in this room?

775
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,840
Popped?

776
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,760
I just heard like a pop noise.

777
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,920
It wasn't like your graphics card, right?

778
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,639
I hope not.

779
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,519
That would be the first time my computer's blown up

780
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,559
while in a Ludwig tournament.

781
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,019
That would actually be the third time that's happened,

782
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,059
which is pretty impressive that that only happens with Ludwig.

783
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:47,019
Here, Connor.

784
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,260
Hello.

785
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,760
Discord screen share.

786
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,260
Oh.

787
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
Maybe he wants to chat.

788
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,960
And it's just like, oh, you know.

789
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,559
He's just coming in with some rules.

790
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:03,440
Yeah.

791
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,360
How about you share your Discord screen, Connor?

792
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,119
OK, fine.

793
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,440
All right.

794
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
I'm going to think bugs in Tom and Jerry.

795
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you think that's too?

796
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,639
I think so.

797
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,099
I think we win with that.

798
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,179
Very, very interesting question.

799
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,099
What are we going to do with our money?

800
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,780
You're telling me to give a question.

801
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,820
No, no, no, no, no.

802
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,579
Is Tom and Jerry part of the Looney Tunes?

803
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,550
No.

804
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,869
No.

805
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,510
No, no, no.

806
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,989
No.

807
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,280
So they're just completely separate?

808
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,760
Yeah.

809
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,559
Were they part of a different Tom and Jerry universe?

810
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,920
Because there's these merry melodies, right?

811
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,079
I think Tom and Jerry was, I don't know, actually.

812
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,039
I don't know how that works.

813
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,159
MGM, right?

814
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,510
Looney Tunes had like a similar one with Sylvester and Tweety Bird, right?

815
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,170
Yeah, because the Looney Tunes.

816
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,409
Yeah, Tom and Jerry, I guess Tom and Jerry MGM, apparently.

817
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,610
So what else is under MGM?

818
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,860
I don't know.

819
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,710
I mean, I thought they're all owned by the same thing now, aren't they?

820
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,530
Yeah, they're all under one umbrella.

821
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,489
Animaniacs.

822
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:09,039
I like the Animaniacs.

823
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,300
The Wizard of Oz.

824
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,139
If he plays the Tin Man, that'd be amazing.

825
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:19,710
Let's put them all in.

826
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,170
Tom and Jerry were Hanna-Barbera.

827
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,420
Really?

828
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,059
Interesting.

829
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah, Metroid, Goldman and Mayer.

830
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,360
I watched so much Tom and Jerry as a kid.

831
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,559
It was my favorite thing.

832
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,300
I was a Looney Tunes guy.

833
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,940
Daffy Duck.

834
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,119
Yeah, I also did like the Looney Tunes.

835
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,039
I had the big VHS box set that had all of them.

836
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,230
I would watch as a kid.

837
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,590
It's crazy just how many episodes there are of all these old cartoons.

838
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,869
Yeah, there's so many.

839
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:58,030
People think like, oh, Dragon Ball Z has,

840
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,269
Dragon Ball has like fucking 700 episodes.

841
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,869
You know how many episodes of the Looney Tunes,

842
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:02,829
just merry melodies there are?

843
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:08,050
Probably like 1,500.

844
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,449
A lie.

845
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,889
That is more than Dragon Ball Hype up.

846
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,849
Yeah, it's also a lie.

847
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,329
I made it up.

848
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,409
But it's probably something huge.

849
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:16,849
The lawyers made them remove frying pan jokes in later seasons

850
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:20,050
because, quote, kids could have access to frying pans.

851
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,929
Oh.

852
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:21,809
Yo.

853
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:22,369
Hey.

854
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:22,849
Yo.

855
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,050
Apparently, we can start now.

856
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,849
Oh, we're starting now.

857
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,820
Yep, yep.

858
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,380
All right, good luck.

859
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,019
OK, cool.

860
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:27,900
Good luck, good luck.

861
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,179
OK, so Jerma is wrong.

862
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,179
There are only seven Looney Tune episodes.

863
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:40,500
Sorry.

864
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,619
Sorry, this might be incorrect.

865
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,940
No, this is not like Trigun, OK?

866
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,619
Give me a break.

867
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,900
I think there's only seven.

868
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,500
A bunch of people are saying that now.

869
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,760
All right, we're going with that same strat?

870
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,579
Yep, I'm ready.

871
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:56,460
All right, let's go for it.

872
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Remember, if we win, I'm going to do a countdown.

873
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,530
You're going to say, what's up, Doc?

874
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:00,929
OK.

875
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:01,969
Uh-oh, we had an error.

876
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:05,500
You got what?

877
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,329
Does not all players are ready?

878
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,289
No.

879
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,409
Oh, ready, yeah.

880
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,579
I think it's you.

881
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,860
No, I'm ready.

882
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,980
I think they need to be ready.

883
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,619
Oh.

884
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,329
Oh, we need to do our perks, right?

885
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,289
Has anybody else in this whole tournament?

886
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,269
Yeah, I think we have the next screen that we do that on.

887
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,380
I think it broke.

888
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,820
Did it really break?

889
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,530
I think so.

890
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,099
Games and beta.

891
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:31,980
Yeah, this definitely broke.

892
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,329
What does their screen look like?

893
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,449
Oh, hold on.

894
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:38,130
Oh, the pleasure is...

895
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,489
You can reset it.

896
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:40,130
Try it again?

897
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,530
OK.

898
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:46,219
Yeah, surely it works this time.

899
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:49,230
Here comes the heat.

900
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,750
OK, try it again.

901
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,789
All right, we should think about perks,

902
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:54,510
because I think I have...

903
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,550
OK, if you say so.

904
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,230
We can do team perks, all right?

905
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:58,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,349
So it'll show you in this next screen what I run, I think.

907
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:01,280
I got 20%.

908
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,719
Is there anything that you really want?

909
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,179
Not really.

910
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,059
This is what I run.

911
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,860
I get projectile speed, which is good for Tom and Jerry.

912
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,099
Yeah.

913
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,900
And the air moves is pretty good.

914
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,460
And then the last one, air acceleration, I don't really care.

915
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,050
Sometimes I do the 100 damage one is pretty good.

916
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,010
I like this one, 20% reduction to ground and wall bounce,

917
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,940
so we're not just going to bounce around.

918
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,659
Oh, yeah.

919
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,989
One additional damage.

920
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,920
I'll run the speed one and you run the wall bounce,

921
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,000
because I think we still both get each other's perks.

922
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,719
Yeah, I think if we have the same one, it doubles up.

923
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,980
Yeah, it doubles it.

924
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,179
All right, well, let's go.

925
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:42,079
I'm running an iron giant.

926
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,320
OK.

927
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,119
Show them what we got.

928
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,260
OK.

929
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,139
All right.

930
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,739
They're doing iron giant.

931
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,940
They might cheese us.

932
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,679
They might cheese us here.

933
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,000
OK.

934
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:54,940
OK.

935
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,190
All right, let's go.

936
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,750
Let's go.

937
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,420
I've seen you win these.

938
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,219
All right, let's go.

939
00:41:59,219 --> 00:41:59,860
Try hard.

940
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,159
Put your try hard shoes on.

941
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,440
I'm going to taunt right off the bat.

942
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,840
There we go.

943
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,530
Oh, you didn't expect that one, did you?

944
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,090
Oh, we're good.

945
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,409
We're good.

946
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:53,659
We're good.

947
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:54,300
Oh, shit.

948
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,699
It's OK.

949
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:55,579
Shoot.

950
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:56,059
He's low.

951
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:02,349
Oh, he's so low.

952
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:10,289
I lived.

953
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,409
Oh, we just got to get rid of him.

954
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:12,849
Please die.

955
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, oh, see you later.

956
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,239
Let's go.

957
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:18,960
Use that momentum.

958
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:29,739
I'm gaming so hard right now.

959
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,000
All right.

960
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,400
It's fine.

961
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,260
Shit.

962
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,980
We're getting juggled.

963
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:48,079
We're good.

964
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:48,320
OK.

965
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,300
No, shit.

966
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:50,940
OK.

967
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,260
We're good.

968
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,579
We're good.

969
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,099
All right.

970
00:43:57,489 --> 00:43:58,050
Oh, my God.

971
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,090
Slick is such a nerd.

972
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:00,690
All right.

973
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:01,809
I'm going Iron Giant this time.

974
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:02,289
All right.

975
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:03,010
All right.

976
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,969
My Iron Giant's better.

977
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:04,289
All right.

978
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:05,739
I got juggled.

979
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,539
We're going to match their comp.

980
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:07,420
We're going to match their comp.

981
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,500
I'm going LeBron.

982
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,050
OK.

983
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,409
You're confident, LeBron.

984
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:22,670
Everyone's saying, oh, no.

985
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,840
We have to win so we can do this.

986
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,880
We're going to be fine.

987
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,760
Everything's going to be OK.

988
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,010
Yeah, we got Iron Giant too.

989
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,960
Loser picks stage.

990
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,920
I don't care what stage we get.

991
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,320
We'll win.

992
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,519
What was that laugh?

993
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,360
That was like a little goblin laugh.

994
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,000
All right, we got it.

995
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,400
We got it.

996
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,960
Pull it back.

997
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,099
I think these perks are OK.

998
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,909
Wolf ball speed, projectile speed.

999
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:58,659
Yeah, I think those are pretty good.

1000
00:44:58,659 --> 00:44:59,699
If you want to match the.

1001
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:00,179
All right.

1002
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:01,139
Yeah, it's all shit.

1003
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:01,699
All right.

1004
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,260
You're good.

1005
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,739
All right.

1006
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:06,139
I'm going as hard as I can for this one.

1007
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,099
We win this one.

1008
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:08,699
We don't lose to Iron Giant twice.

1009
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:12,050
No, I got the cooler skin too.

1010
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,920
This is going to be a 40 minute stream.

1011
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,559
No, it's not.

1012
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:15,119
Just wait.

1013
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,489
We're going to pull it back right here.

1014
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:18,130
I've had shorter.

1015
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,320
I've had shorter.

1016
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,559
All right.

1017
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:20,800
You're good.

1018
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,519
Good to go.

1019
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,590
Yep.

1020
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:40,719
Keep that juggle up.

1021
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,159
Make him go off the screen.

1022
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:42,960
Oh, he's so low.

1023
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,730
There he goes.

1024
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:06,989
He's right here.

1025
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:12,579
All right.

1026
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:17,519
Is there bugs even taking much damage?

1027
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:18,079
I can't even tell.

1028
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,559
I don't think their bugs have taken any damage.

1029
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:21,360
He said he was bad.

1030
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,800
I can't believe it.

1031
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,480
So many iron giants.

1032
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:37,519
We're good.

1033
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,380
Oh, my God.

1034
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,320
Oh, keep it up.

1035
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,880
I can't jump that high.

1036
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,920
Give me a kill, man.

1037
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,320
There he goes.

1038
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,559
All right.

1039
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,599
There we go.

1040
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:02,719
There's bugs.

1041
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,480
We got to get rid of this fucking bug.

1042
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:10,800
There he goes.

1043
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:10,960
All right.

1044
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,199
All right.

1045
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,320
We got to bully somebody.

1046
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,880
Bully somebody.

1047
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:17,699
I can't believe it.

1048
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,500
Oh, shit.

1049
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,820
All right.

1050
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,659
God, I hate this.

1051
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:23,699
This is so sad.

1052
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:23,940
It's all right.

1053
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,420
It's all right.

1054
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:24,659
We're good.

1055
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:24,820
We're good.

1056
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,900
Wait, wait.

1057
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,019
Is it best of three?

1058
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,139
I think it's the best of three.

1059
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:30,900
You guys are down in losers bracket.

1060
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,619
But no worries.

1061
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:32,820
Still a lot more gameplay played.

1062
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,369
Can we ban iron giant?

1063
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,880
No.

1064
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,280
All right.

1065
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,960
Well, all right.

1066
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,719
We just need to figure out a solution to our problem.

1067
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:47,920
I don't fucking care if we lost.

1068
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:57,409
I'm doing the joke.

1069
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:03,199
Well, if you catch me playing Rhindog, I did.

1070
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,079
That's how you know I've lost it.

1071
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,920
These things are going to get to be like room champ.

1072
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,400
I don't want to.

1073
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,610
I want to like a nice ice cold carrot.

1074
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,610
Even if you're eating a cold carrot.

1075
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,860
All right.

1076
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,059
We're going to bring it back.

1077
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:19,980
We're going to fucking do it.

1078
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,210
Are you doing like a bugs bunny joke?

1079
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:28,750
Oh, we're going to dominate the next one.

1080
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,599
We should challenge them double or nothing.

1081
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,179
I'm going to play.

1082
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:40,460
I couldn't do it.

1083
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,179
I couldn't.

1084
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,070
I couldn't see.

1085
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,349
Yeah, I couldn't tell what was going on.

1086
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:46,750
Too many iron giants.

1087
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,670
Yeah, maybe should have just stuck Tom and Jerry.

1088
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,670
But it was a good play.

1089
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,349
I thought I had the better iron giant.

1090
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,309
I still think I did.

1091
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:57,230
I just, you know, there's a there's a lot of input lag.

1092
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,030
Look, and I live like 15 minutes away from each other.

1093
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,190
It's like, you know, if we were closer, maybe it'd be better.

1094
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,510
Yeah.

1095
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,179
I mean, well, there's a thing.

1096
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,260
Yeah, they're.

1097
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,860
Yeah, they had they had pink advantage.

1098
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:15,380
Amen.

1099
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,989
That was a good game, man.

1100
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:19,550
Are we going to keep is there more than like this best of three

1101
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,750
or is that the only best of three?

1102
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,750
I mean, we can double or nothing if you want.

1103
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,690
I don't really see a point in that.

1104
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:28,289
They already just won like unanimously.

1105
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:30,099
I don't know why they would do that.

1106
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:32,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:34,099
Were we supposed to lose the second one?

1108
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,460
I didn't even get the script.

1109
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,260
Yeah, you were.

1110
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,860
Well, that would have been ideal.

1111
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,900
But it's OK.

1112
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,219
Like we German had like a joke.

1113
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:43,260
No, it's OK.

1114
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,059
No, it's all good.

1115
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,920
It worked out.

1116
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,159
Yeah.

1117
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:47,519
Did you guys get the joke off?

1118
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,239
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,019
No, it worked out good.

1120
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,090
Yeah.

1121
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,210
Yeah, definitely.

1122
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,929
Yeah.

1123
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:53,170
Yeah.

1124
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,929
I mean, yeah, I recommend.

1125
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,210
Yeah, probably play Iron Giant.

1126
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,090
So, yeah.

1127
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,650
Next time you guys got to send me the joke before we didn't give you the script.

1128
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,090
Oh, that's on me.

1129
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,889
I apologize.

1130
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,250
I was in charge of that and I made a mistake.

1131
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,050
I made an error.

1132
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,809
OK.

1133
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:11,889
Anyways, I hope you guys win big.

1134
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:13,650
You guys are you guys did really good.

1135
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,409
And you know, you earned it.

1136
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:16,210
You know, you guys played good.

1137
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,090
You earned it.

1138
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,530
You had really good bugs as well.

1139
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,510
GGs, guys.

1140
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,789
GGs, guys.

1141
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:22,190
Good game.

1142
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,989
Seriously.

1143
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,190
Good games.

1144
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,070
Good luck in the journey.

1145
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:32,400
We should have done what's up, Doc.

1146
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,440
We should have what's up, Doc.

1147
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm right at the end.

1148
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,150
Just do it again.

1149
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,429
Well, these have to last the whole stream.

1150
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,099
I only have French fries.

1151
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,150
Is there a character that like really likes French fries?

1152
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,780
Is there a character that's a French fry character?

1153
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,420
I don't know.

1154
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,539
I don't know.

1155
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,920
I'm trying to think if there's a.

1156
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,559
Oh, yeah.

1157
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,119
French fries.

1158
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,340
Popeye has spinach.

1159
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,300
Bugs has carrots.

1160
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,780
Rhyndog loves French fries.

1161
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,300
Daffy has cocaine.

1162
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:09,170
What else?

1163
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,739
What are the other like staples?

1164
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,579
Apparently, Rhyndog loves French fries.

1165
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:14,530
Really?

1166
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,090
Yeah.

1167
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,050
That's what they're all saying.

1168
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,489
They're all big Rhyndog fans.

1169
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:20,539
Steven Universe likes fries?

1170
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:22,860
I am playing Steven Universe.

1171
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,250
Wait, you're not playing Steven Universe?

1172
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:25,750
I refuse.

1173
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,619
Why?

1174
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,469
I don't know.

1175
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:32,510
There was a kid in my high school that really liked Steven Universe.

1176
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:33,809
And they were annoying to me.

1177
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,409
So it just ever since I was like,

1178
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:38,210
I just didn't ever want to think about Steven Universe.

1179
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,170
I haven't even unlocked them.

1180
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,170
I have like 30 character tokens

1181
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,489
and that character is still just locked on my screen.

1182
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:44,289
So you get it then.

1183
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:44,769
Okay.

1184
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,590
So Connor gets it.

1185
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,710
Everyone thought I was crazy when I said this.

1186
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:47,869
Okay.

1187
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,949
When you play a game like multiverses

1188
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:51,230
or like Smash Brothers, whatever,

1189
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,389
that is a bunch of characters from different universes,

1190
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,300
different games, different TV shows.

1191
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,309
If you get your ass kicked by like a bunch of try-hards

1192
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:00,989
on a single character, right?

1193
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,110
Doesn't it make you hate the fucking show?

1194
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,159
Oh, a thousand percent.

1195
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:06,639
Right?

1196
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,079
The thing is I just hated it prior.

1197
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,760
But yeah, you're right about it though.

1198
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,280
If they start pissing me off,

1199
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,440
there's no chance I'm ever playing a Fire Emblem game in my life.

1200
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:15,760
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1201
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,679
I went up against a bunch of Fins and Jakes

1202
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,739
that I got just dominated by probably dozens of times.

1203
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:25,119
And it genuinely makes me not want to watch Adventure Time ever again.

1204
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, I don't blame you.

1205
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,760
It's starting to piss me off.

1206
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,440
I don't even like Finn as a character anymore.

1207
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,250
I just think about him like spinning his backpack around

1208
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,849
and I'm like, yeah, it's not entertaining.

1209
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:37,219
You guys talking about me again?

1210
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:38,929
Yeah.

1211
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:40,820
Oh, you ready to boot up?

1212
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,579
You guys are going up against Lily and Michael.

1213
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:43,539
All right, let's do it.

1214
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:44,989
Such a big fan.

1215
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:47,409
Did they add us?

1216
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:48,050
How does that work?

1217
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:48,690
We're going to need to add.

1218
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,550
Pop it in the wall if they're not doing it off rip.

1219
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,389
Everyone's thing is in general too as well.

1220
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:56,510
Yeah, I'll add them right now.

1221
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,519
Lovely.

1222
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,559
Cool, cool, cool.

1223
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,489
How are you Ludwig?

1224
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:06,449
He deafened.

1225
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:09,139
All right, let me add some adding here.

1226
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,409
Let me make sure I get this right.

1227
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:23,440
I probably should tell because this is a random fucking weirdo

1228
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,280
Scarlet Otter is adding you.

1229
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,760
That's not me.

1230
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,320
You know what I mean?

1231
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,599
I should probably tell them.

1232
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,679
Fake Scarlet Otters everywhere.

1233
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,099
The guy who took my name felt bad about it.

1234
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:38,820
And then like, so I added Connor Eats Pants on here

1235
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,059
and then they changed their name to like,

1236
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,380
I don't know how to fix.

1237
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,340
And then I tried to change it back to Connor Eats Pants

1238
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,260
and then the name is still like gone.

1239
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,340
It's just like removed from the pool of names now.

1240
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,860
Dude, do you see what I just wrote in the general?

1241
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,590
I don't even know my own user.

1242
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,670
I'm Scarlet Otter and some numbers.

1243
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,829
I genuinely don't know what it is.

1244
00:53:58,829 --> 00:53:59,469
It's on the screen.

1245
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,670
It's 505.

1246
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,679
Is it?

1247
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,280
Yeah, it's right below.

1248
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,760
Yeah.

1249
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,659
Jerma just posted lewd photos in the general chat.

1250
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:11,070
I can't believe it.

1251
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,309
All right, let me get Michael.

1252
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:16,829
Oh, that was Lily that added me.

1253
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,550
I was like, wow, that person's got the $100 edition of the game

1254
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,590
and they tried to add me.

1255
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,980
I should have known considering their name was Lily.

1256
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,679
How many L's?

1257
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,659
I hope I got that right.

1258
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:35,460
That was like, yeah, Michael's name.

1259
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,159
There you go.

1260
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,920
All right, profile pics.

1261
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,000
I can't believe we're getting some e-daters, dude.

1262
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,039
All right, here we go.

1263
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,730
Good.

1264
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,610
All right, no hazards.

1265
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,730
Seven minutes, four ring outs.

1266
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:52,849
All right, all the maps are good.

1267
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:55,170
All right, so I'm going bugs again.

1268
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,070
Dude, just use your main.

1269
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,030
Yep, I'm ready.

1270
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,099
I can't believe the matching profile pics.

1271
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,300
We got to one up that.

1272
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:04,900
Do you want to do?

1273
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,219
I don't know.

1274
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:06,539
What do you have?

1275
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:09,099
Do you have the LeBron profile picture?

1276
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:09,820
The basketball?

1277
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,369
No.

1278
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:12,869
No.

1279
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,690
I have the...

1280
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,050
Just copy theirs.

1281
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:18,690
Just copy?

1282
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,489
Put on the Steven Universe star.

1283
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:24,539
Oh, wait, it doesn't change.

1284
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:25,980
No, it doesn't change it.

1285
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,739
Oh, I thought you didn't like Steven Universe, though.

1286
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:28,219
I thought you didn't like it.

1287
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,500
I just wanted to like scare them.

1288
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,099
I just wanted to like match their profile pics.

1289
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,500
Then we could like maybe get in their head a little bit.

1290
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:41,260
Why is my voice pitched up?

1291
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,699
It is.

1292
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:46,019
I think they mean like when I talk.

1293
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,920
Oh, no, it is now, though.

1294
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,739
Oh, it is, right?

1295
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,739
Yeah, you're like you're more than pitched up.

1296
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:56,530
You're like like a bit of robot pitched up.

1297
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,309
Dude, yeah, I got to go XLR.

1298
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:01,179
It's fucking cool.

1299
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:01,980
Yeah, wait, hold on.

1300
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,789
I got this.

1301
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:06,909
I don't know.

1302
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:08,750
There we go.

1303
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,559
Do you just keep this on?

1304
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,619
Should we keep it on?

1305
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:19,019
Let's go.

1306
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:19,579
Let's go for it.

1307
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,260
Dude, funny voices stream.

1308
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,019
Yes, people love that.

1309
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:35,789
I'm glad you understand like the rhythm of like, oh, we're stuck on the waiting screen

1310
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:37,150
and I don't know what to do for the stream.

1311
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,539
I'm just going to start pressing buttons on the go XLR.

1312
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:41,900
Yeah, that's kind of how it goes.

1313
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,579
These carrots are just good, by the way.

1314
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:46,769
I got to start having carrots on command.

1315
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:47,809
That's a good idea.

1316
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:51,820
Are you eating carrots and playing Bugs Bunny?

1317
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,179
That was a joke and we lost.

1318
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,340
I got these big ass just like Omega carrots and it was going to be like,

1319
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,860
oh, we're going to win Bugs and it's going to be funny.

1320
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,739
It's not funny.

1321
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:03,780
Give like a Bugs catchphrase you can do on command.

1322
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:07,219
Yeah, I'll give it to you.

1323
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:07,699
Ready?

1324
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,329
You give it to me.

1325
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,480
What's up, Jack?

1326
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,500
That was pretty good.

1327
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,179
That was phenomenal, Jerma.

1328
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:16,820
Pretty good one.

1329
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:19,920
That was genuinely great.

1330
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,389
Oh, thank you.

1331
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:24,670
Are you guys waiting to start?

1332
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,389
Peter Griffin.

1333
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,440
Yeah, we're ready.

1334
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,320
We're ready to go.

1335
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,760
Yeah, you're Bugs Bunny and I'm like Peter Griffin trying to do a Bugs Bunny.

1336
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:41,650
That's going to be in my head now.

1337
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,369
You guys fucked me up.

1338
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:42,929
We're going to lose.

1339
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:47,170
They should add Peter.

1340
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,289
Yeah, they should.

1341
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:51,039
What does it sound like with the filter on?

1342
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:55,460
What's up, Jack?

1343
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:00,500
Are we supposed to play?

1344
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:05,860
What's up, bro?

1345
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,829
We should go.

1346
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:09,789
It just sounds like you're going like,

1347
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:14,429
like you just ate the fucking like hot fucking Cheetos.

1348
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:18,059
Should we go?

1349
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:18,940
Are we ready?

1350
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,500
I don't know.

1351
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,139
Is that?

1352
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:20,800
I don't know.

1353
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,820
Did he say blood wig?

1354
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,900
Did he say go?

1355
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,130
I think he said go.

1356
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,809
I think, I think we go.

1357
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:33,550
Are we going to go?

1358
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,110
Go.

1359
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:34,510
Go?

1360
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,510
Well, I see like the other streams look like they're playing.

1361
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:43,090
All right, let's go.

1362
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,369
You guys, you guys can start.

1363
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:45,489
Oh, yeah, we did.

1364
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,650
Okay, okay, just getting some lag.

1365
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,710
The game is just lagging a little bit.

1366
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:58,130
There's a lot of scarlet otters online.

1367
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,969
It's kind of messing with the netcode.

1368
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,250
Oh shit, they're in universe.

1369
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,530
They get 10% damage buff.

1370
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,110
Is that real?

1371
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,550
Yeah.

1372
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,320
So if we don't get the Scooby Doo stage, then they're going to be triple buffed.

1373
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:18,289
All right, let's just, let's just make it happen.

1374
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:18,610
Let's go.

1375
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,969
You ready to have a sip of green tea?

1376
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:22,530
Yep.

1377
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:31,730
We're not going to be on the stage too, right?

1378
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,289
Uh oh.

1379
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:33,170
Are we on their stage?

1380
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,849
Oh God, that's a net, that's 20% damage.

1381
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,860
This might be rigged is what I'm thinking.

1382
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,940
I don't know if Ludwig can hear us, but I've heard that there's a conspiracy against us.

1383
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:50,239
Sometimes I heard people were saying that mentioning that they killed Jerry.

1384
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:17,619
Whoa.

1385
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:31,460
There it is.

1386
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:41,150
I got her solo.

1387
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:42,530
There it goes.

1388
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,250
Whoa.

1389
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:48,449
We're good.

1390
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh my God.

1391
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,119
We're better, Jerma.

1392
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:57,840
Just keep it up.

1393
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,239
Don't say that.

1394
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,739
We don't know.

1395
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,320
It'll be a massive comeback.

1396
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:00,820
You don't know.

1397
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:09,809
Oh, that kills.

1398
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:11,329
Oh, they have the profile pick buff too.

1399
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:16,019
Oh my God.

1400
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:16,320
We're good.

1401
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,820
We're good.

1402
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:57,739
Get that knockout.

1403
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,579
Oh my God, he's so slippery.

1404
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:12,340
So slippery.

1405
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:12,820
All right, we got it.

1406
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,320
Good, good, good.

1407
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,260
That was an accident, but it worked.

1408
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,389
Oh my goodness.

1409
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:21,230
We almost just got double taken out.

1410
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:22,269
That was almost so bad.

1411
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,860
Oh, one hit, one hit, one hit.

1412
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,590
Just die.

1413
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,389
Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.

1414
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,030
He's dead.

1415
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:38,510
Okay, we're good.

1416
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,230
Good, good, good, good, good.

1417
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:39,730
Yes.

1418
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,110
We got one.

1419
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,389
What's up, Doc?

1420
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,110
What's up, Doc?

1421
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,389
I just bit my tongue in half.

1422
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:50,610
We're good.

1423
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,409
We're good.

1424
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:51,889
We're good.

1425
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:52,289
We're good.

1426
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:52,769
We're good.

1427
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,409
I'm so happy.

1428
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,269
We did it.

1429
01:02:56,269 --> 01:02:56,989
We got one.

1430
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,369
I screamed so loud.

1431
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,539
That was a really good match.

1432
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:07,539
They could have taken that any second.

1433
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,780
We played with heart, though.

1434
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,619
They could have taken that at any second.

1435
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:17,539
All right, we're going to stick with what we have,

1436
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:19,380
or we're going to go change it up.

1437
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,900
I think we stick with it.

1438
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,260
If it works, it works, right?

1439
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,420
We've only been beaten by an iron giant.

1440
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,519
All right, okay.

1441
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:34,449
I feel like my Bugs is off today.

1442
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:35,570
Maybe I'll go Superman.

1443
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,170
I feel off today, too.

1444
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,130
Something's in the air.

1445
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:47,340
Yeah, I'm sleeping on my Superman.

1446
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,179
My Superman's actually probably better than my Bugs.

1447
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:50,460
My Bugs aren't that great.

1448
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,769
Maybe time to bring up Superman next time.

1449
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:58,460
Do you have a good Superman line?

1450
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,679
Yeah, believe everything to me.

1451
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:06,800
Yeah.

1452
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,320
And then he goes down, and he farts.

1453
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,880
The only super media I've seen is the Zack Snyder movie,

1454
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,239
so he doesn't really do that.

1455
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:16,000
He's more upset.

1456
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:40,349
Here we go.

1457
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,000
Just be careful.

1458
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,400
Be careful.

1459
01:04:53,039 --> 01:05:05,010
Let's go.

1460
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:05,650
Wait a minute.

1461
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:06,130
There he is.

1462
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,440
It's a beta keratin, I think.

1463
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:11,360
That was deficient.

1464
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,599
Improved your eyesight.

1465
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,039
That's how the carrots work.

1466
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,400
I mean, it's been like 20 minutes

1467
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,920
since I took the first bite, right?

1468
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,159
Yep.

1469
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:29,980
Oh, my God.

1470
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,619
Good game, good game.

1471
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:31,500
You went off that game.

1472
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,760
Something was in you.

1473
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,440
Might have been the carrots.

1474
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,039
You were an animal that round.

1475
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,639
The beta keratin finally kicked in.

1476
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,079
Do you have a mouthful of carrots?

1477
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,420
Yep.

1478
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,300
I love that.

1479
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,420
Congratulations, you two.

1480
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,699
Great edge guard on the left side.

1481
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:49,179
Great win.

1482
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,780
And you're moving on.

1483
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:56,699
Yeah, good game, good game.

1484
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,539
I just kind of popped off.

1485
01:05:58,619 --> 01:05:59,900
Like, that's all, is it?

1486
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,550
I don't know what happened, man.

1487
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,389
Something got in you.

1488
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:06,659
They almost took that first game, though.

1489
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:07,300
That was good.

1490
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,030
That was a good match.

1491
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,349
All right.

1492
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:12,349
So the biggest losers bracket run of all time

1493
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:14,989
is what people are saying is about to happen.

1494
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:18,500
Essentially the best losers run

1495
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,780
in multiverses history.

1496
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:20,420
What the fuck?

1497
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,699
I just look like an idiot.

1498
01:06:21,699 --> 01:06:22,289
What?

1499
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:22,929
What's wrong?

1500
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:25,010
Look at the lobby.

1501
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:28,019
It looks like I did that and you didn't.

1502
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:31,260
And you were convincing me not to do that.

1503
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,579
Wait, you're still the skull for me.

1504
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:35,099
I'm not on my screen.

1505
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,480
Oh, that's embarrassing.

1506
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,039
Oh, God.

1507
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,480
No, but that's not supposed to be like that.

1508
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,679
That was something we did before.

1509
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:40,639
That's all right.

1510
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:42,690
Oh, come on.

1511
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,860
I feel like, wow, I can't believe this.

1512
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,300
That was just Scarlett Otter guy

1513
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,059
just changed his profile picture to ours.

1514
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:49,420
That was your fucking idea.

1515
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,139
I'm on the star now, too, for what it's worth.

1516
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:57,039
That's not what I...

1517
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:58,639
We were doing the thing at the...

1518
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,760
Why did it change now?

1519
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,559
Oh, my God.

1520
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,320
I hope they understand that.

1521
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,360
Please, I hope they understand that.

1522
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:06,079
I'm not trying to be like Dick.

1523
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:14,929
That looks so bad.

1524
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:18,000
These french fries are pretty good.

1525
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,150
Dude, do you have any carrots?

1526
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:21,869
No.

1527
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:22,510
Really?

1528
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,289
No, I don't have any carrots.

1529
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:25,889
I'm telling you, that's what changed.

1530
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:28,239
I think I do need some.

1531
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:29,460
Oh, wait, there it goes.

1532
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,099
It changed back.

1533
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:33,070
Oh, now I have the star.

1534
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:37,949
Stop making enemies.

1535
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,349
They're awesome people.

1536
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:47,920
What are you talking about?

1537
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
Did you ever tell them

1538
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,440
the story of you meeting Mr. Beast?

1539
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:52,739
No.

1540
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,340
Because I told it...

1541
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:57,699
I told from my perspective that story.

1542
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,579
It was really funny.

1543
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:00,849
You can tell it.

1544
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,650
I'm sorry.

1545
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:02,150
Yeah.

1546
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:08,579
So I took Jerma to the Ninja Mr. Beast event,

1547
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,739
the League of Legends event.

1548
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:14,420
And we go backstage to Mr. Beast's team room.

1549
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,260
And it's just a few people in there.

1550
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,060
And I was like, okay.

1551
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:19,460
Jerma, you can say hi to Mr. Beast.

1552
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,939
Now, Mr. Beast was very much like hyper focused

1553
01:08:21,939 --> 01:08:23,060
on like league mode.

1554
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,819
He was only focused on that,

1555
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:25,859
looking at his iPad or whatever,

1556
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:26,979
looking over game plans.

1557
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:28,109
And they were sitting on the couch

1558
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:28,909
and Jerma goes like,

1559
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:31,140
I think you said something like,

1560
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,020
hey, I'm Jerma.

1561
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:33,619
He didn't say anything.

1562
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,899
Like, he was just there.

1563
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:37,859
And I was like, oh, no.

1564
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:39,619
And I was like, hey, Jimmy, Jimmy.

1565
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:40,420
This is Jerma.

1566
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,460
He's a YouTuber.

1567
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,340
And he was like, oh, okay.

1568
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,939
Hey, nice to meet you.

1569
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:45,760
And I was like, okay.

1570
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,119
Well, kind of saved.

1571
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:48,479
And then I'm like, no, no, no, don't worry.

1572
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,560
He definitely watched your TF2 videos.

1573
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,880
He's a busy guy, right?

1574
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,239
He's a busy guy.

1575
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,539
He's a busy guy.

1576
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:59,579
But he knew who you were after.

1577
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:01,420
Well, even if he doesn't, that's fine.

1578
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,939
You expect everybody to know who you are.

1579
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,439
It was kind of funny, though.

1580
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:06,939
Yeah, it was probably funny.

1581
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:14,960
He's the sus guy.

1582
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,479
Tell me the sus guy.

1583
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,090
Yeah, he's the sus guy, right?

1584
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:19,489
Yeah.

1585
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,890
But, okay, let me ask you something.

1586
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,210
Yep.

1587
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:27,329
Would MrBeast know me more as the sus guy

1588
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,329
or as the guy that used to make TF2 videos like 12 years ago?

1589
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:33,489
I think, honestly, TF2 videos,

1590
01:09:33,489 --> 01:09:35,489
he's a very old school YouTube guy.

1591
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:36,130
He is, right?

1592
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,859
Isn't he?

1593
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:40,979
Maybe sus guy, too, though.

1594
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:45,789
That might ring a few bells.

1595
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:46,750
How'd it even happen?

1596
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,350
I just remember randomly at some point,

1597
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,350
it was like sus was now associated with you.

1598
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:52,479
Just like appeared.

1599
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,409
Somebody made a meme, which was like,

1600
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:56,850
oh, look, when the imposter is sus,

1601
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,850
and I put it on my screen for five seconds.

1602
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,460
That'll do it.

1603
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,899
Wasn't there the guy that like burned that image into his TV?

1604
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:05,380
Oh, yeah.

1605
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:08,930
That guy was full of shit, though.

1606
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:15,789
It's 10 years, not 12.

1607
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:18,270
Well, it's 2022, going into 2023.

1608
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,229
It'll be 11.

1609
01:10:19,229 --> 01:10:19,789
Sorry.

1610
01:10:19,789 --> 01:10:26,319
I've been making videos since 2007.

1611
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:31,100
I made a, I would recall.

1612
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,670
How old were you?

1613
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,109
I was eight years old.

1614
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,649
What?

1615
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:39,250
I got a camcorder, my mom's camcorder,

1616
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,850
and I would use the macro function

1617
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,569
to zoom in from far away to the focus work

1618
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:46,930
on my Nintendo DS Pokemon Diamond Wi-Fi battles.

1619
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:47,430
Wow.

1620
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:52,220
That's unbelievable.

1621
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,180
Eight years old.

1622
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,199
And I was bad.

1623
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,079
I was very bad at the game,

1624
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:00,800
and I didn't understand how the tiers worked.

1625
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,560
I'm like, why couldn't you use certain Pokemon?

1626
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
Because they were too good.

1627
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,439
And so I would join battles,

1628
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:07,119
and they'd be like, you can't use this guy.

1629
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:09,680
And I would just be like, no, I'm using this Jirachi.

1630
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,479
I want to use it.

1631
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,520
And it was just like a completely cheated Pokemon, too.

1632
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,960
But I enjoyed it.

1633
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,140
Remember, you were like 60 when he was eight.

1634
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,710
Someone said, so that's why you were like this.

1635
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,909
Yeah, no, that is why.

1636
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:24,369
That's what happened.

1637
01:11:24,369 --> 01:11:29,329
As a kid, I was pissed they didn't let me use Charizard.

1638
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:30,289
Okay, well, you're just wrong,

1639
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:31,729
because Charizard's not even that good.

1640
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,529
So he's never been banned.

1641
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:40,590
I made that up, acting like I don't know the tiers of Pokemon.

1642
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,310
Come on, now.

1643
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,819
What's your favorite Pokemon?

1644
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:46,850
Favorite Pokemon?

1645
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:47,810
Probably Wooper.

1646
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:50,609
Who's Wooper?

1647
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:51,649
You don't know Wooper?

1648
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:55,520
All I know, I know like 10 Pokemon.

1649
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,960
Okay, I know all of them.

1650
01:11:57,949 --> 01:11:58,350
Oh, you do?

1651
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,829
Name all 150 original Pokemon right now.

1652
01:12:00,829 --> 01:12:06,000
I honestly, there's a 20% chance you name a number of the first 150,

1653
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,600
and I might be able to tell you which one it is.

1654
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,180
Okay.

1655
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,850
Um.

1656
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:16,399
Eight.

1657
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:16,960
Vermilion.

1658
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,909
I got to get like a thing to see.

1659
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:24,750
Original 150 Pokemon.

1660
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:28,060
And they had their numbered?

1661
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,180
Is it?

1662
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,060
Okay, let's see.

1663
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,430
That was a softball one, was it?

1664
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,229
Okay, hold on, let me see.

1665
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:36,670
Let me get the list here.

1666
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,109
Bit of a softball.

1667
01:12:38,109 --> 01:12:40,430
Was it a softball?

1668
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,989
Yeah, because the first nine are all starters, right?

1669
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:44,670
And so I just remembered it started Bulbasaur,

1670
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,729
then it was Squirtle, and then it was Charmander.

1671
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:49,819
So then number eight would be Charmeleon.

1672
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:50,300
What?

1673
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:50,859
How do you know that?

1674
01:12:50,859 --> 01:12:52,779
Okay, so hold on, let me get, I got one here.

1675
01:12:52,779 --> 01:12:55,949
All right, I'll give you, let's get you a tough one.

1676
01:12:55,949 --> 01:12:56,829
Oh, it's Wartortle?

1677
01:12:56,829 --> 01:12:57,550
Oh, nevermind.

1678
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,189
I messed up then.

1679
01:12:58,189 --> 01:12:59,460
Oh, you messed up?

1680
01:12:59,460 --> 01:12:59,699
Yeah.

1681
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:05,789
All right, how about number 30?

1682
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:15,949
Um, I think, I think Raichu's 26.

1683
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:16,829
God damn, I have the wrong,

1684
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:20,510
this is original 150 Pokemon according to my boyfriend.

1685
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:23,569
It's like they're all just fake names.

1686
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:23,890
Hold on.

1687
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:26,050
Oh, well, let me take,

1688
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:29,649
give me a hint as to what that one's boyfriend name is.

1689
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:30,689
They're blue?

1690
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:34,539
Oh, Nidorino, Nidorina, one of them.

1691
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:38,289
Um, one of them, the one before it is,

1692
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:41,779
they call it Water Mouse.

1693
01:13:41,779 --> 01:13:43,220
It's a blue mouse and it's like,

1694
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,979
Oh yeah, Nidorina.

1695
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:51,489
Okay, but the one after that is the one that's apparently 30.

1696
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:59,060
Uh, wait, Nidoran is one of them.

1697
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,189
Okay.

1698
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:01,789
Oh wait, here's a, here's a list.

1699
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,619
Here's an actual list, okay.

1700
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:07,949
How about, um, 39?

1701
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,630
39, um.

1702
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,430
Do you want me to give you a hint?

1703
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:17,359
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

1704
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:18,880
That's so much more than a hint.

1705
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,640
That's, it's Jigglypuff.

1706
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,279
Oh, okay, good.

1707
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:21,760
You got it.

1708
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,600
All right, what's the name of the Pokemon?

1709
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,640
What's 41?

1710
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,920
You said Jigglypuff was what?

1711
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,539
39.

1712
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:33,819
Trousy?

1713
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:36,770
Sorry, it's Zubat.

1714
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:37,250
Yeah.

1715
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,939
Okay, how about, let's-

1716
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:41,840
I could at least name every Pokemon up to like,

1717
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,649
if I saw Silhouette, I could name, I think almost every Pokemon.

1718
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:46,289
That's so cool.

1719
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:48,989
All right, what about, who's 149?

1720
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:49,710
Not 150.

1721
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,149
We know, we all know who that is.

1722
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:53,710
149 is, uh, Dragonair.

1723
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,020
Damn, okay, what about 148?

1724
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,819
Dragonair.

1725
01:14:56,819 --> 01:14:58,020
All right, what about 147?

1726
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:58,909
Keep it up.

1727
01:14:58,909 --> 01:14:59,550
Dratini.

1728
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:02,060
Damn, okay, 146.

1729
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,659
Articuno or Moltres?

1730
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:04,699
Moltres, you got it.

1731
01:15:04,699 --> 01:15:06,689
145.

1732
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:07,649
Uh, Articuno.

1733
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:09,569
Very close.

1734
01:15:09,569 --> 01:15:11,890
Yep, 144 is Articuno.

1735
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,210
It's Articuno, and then before that would be-

1736
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,409
143.

1737
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,210
Joltia?

1738
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,489
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1739
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:22,369
Is it one of those Eevees?

1740
01:15:22,369 --> 01:15:23,729
Nope, I'll give you a hint.

1741
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:28,050
Very sleepy.

1742
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:28,689
Very sleepy.

1743
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:30,130
Oh, Snorlax, Snorlax.

1744
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,409
You got it.

1745
01:15:31,409 --> 01:15:31,810
That's it.

1746
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,329
Drowsy, I'm like, he's not that far up.

1747
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,930
Well, you got a lot in a row.

1748
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,529
That was impressive.

1749
01:15:36,529 --> 01:15:38,289
No, yeah, you're like, this is really cool,

1750
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:40,369
but no, it was bad because like, in school,

1751
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,170
all of my knowledge was just reserved for Pokemon information,

1752
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,090
and I did really bad because like,

1753
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,619
my brain just wouldn't care about like,

1754
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:49,060
knowledge I needed to know for tests.

1755
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,979
It was only reserved for Pokemon.

1756
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:56,510
Yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, you had an interest.

1757
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,390
Yeah, that's true.

1758
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:57,869
Can you imagine-

1759
01:15:57,869 --> 01:15:58,590
It ended up working out.

1760
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,989
Okay, but can you imagine if instead of just like,

1761
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:04,750
random stupid dumb math problems, they made it so like,

1762
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,550
oh, like Sally has five carrots,

1763
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:10,029
Jason has 15 carrots.

1764
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:11,149
Don't you think if they just made it,

1765
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,069
like Squirtle has 15 carrots,

1766
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,630
and Charizard has seven carrots that you would care more.

1767
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,390
You'd be like, oh, six, Charizard's got carrots.

1768
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:20,079
Charizard's gonna care more.

1769
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:21,119
Why don't they do that?

1770
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,350
I don't know.

1771
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:25,010
When I was in kindergarten, I went to a like,

1772
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,649
church school, and then they banned Pokemon like,

1773
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:28,850
right when I got there.

1774
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,689
They were like, you can't talk about Pokemon.

1775
01:16:30,689 --> 01:16:31,890
And then my mom complained.

1776
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,170
It was like, my son likes this.

1777
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,930
He's gonna talk about it.

1778
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:35,329
Sorry.

1779
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,409
And then I was allowed to talk about Pokemon

1780
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:38,609
during recess only.

1781
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,800
Only during recess though, not during school time.

1782
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,319
Not every kid likes Pokemon though.

1783
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,800
Yeah, but couldn't you pull the class on like,

1784
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,319
on a ranked system?

1785
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:51,520
Okay, you got like, the Looney Tunes.

1786
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,180
You got like, Rugrats, Ren and Stimpy,

1787
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,779
Steven Universe, whatever.

1788
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,939
Just have them rank how much they like it,

1789
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:00,300
and then base the whole curriculum.

1790
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,539
Just replace all the dumb boring, like a train

1791
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:05,979
leaves Boston going, you know, 200 miles per hour,

1792
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:09,340
and you know, 10 miles to go visit New Jersey, right?

1793
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,699
Just make it like Steven Universe,

1794
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:13,819
just traveling 200 miles per hour to go visit Charizard.

1795
01:17:13,819 --> 01:17:14,300
Not my son.

1796
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,300
My son is not gonna be learning from Steven Universe.

1797
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,260
Not on my watch.

1798
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:20,289
He'll be, it'll be Bugs Bunny.

1799
01:17:20,289 --> 01:17:22,460
It'll be Tom and Jerry.

1800
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,869
It'll be Ren and Stimpy.

1801
01:17:25,869 --> 01:17:30,800
It'll be not that, anything but that.

1802
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,600
So they're moving way too fast.

1803
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:39,779
When is our next game, sir?

1804
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:41,779
How does, are we just like ignoring people?

1805
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:42,340
What's the deal?

1806
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,420
I think we just been, we were seated so high

1807
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,100
that we're waiting for our next game.

1808
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,899
Oh, that makes sense.

1809
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:50,159
It's like a bracket.

1810
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,500
My physics teacher used to make tests

1811
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,180
with Dragon Ball characters.

1812
01:17:54,180 --> 01:18:00,180
Yeah, and did you get an A+, because you loved that anime?

1813
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,659
I did not care for anime at all as a kid.

1814
01:18:02,659 --> 01:18:05,539
My friends really liked Dragon Ball a ton.

1815
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:08,020
Like, they would always like, they pretend

1816
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,039
and like, be Dragon Ball characters.

1817
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,859
And so I watched the show and I didn't care about like,

1818
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:16,579
the super like, Saiyan characters.

1819
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:18,020
So I found out there was a turtle.

1820
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,100
Like, there's a character that just owns a turtle.

1821
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,779
Like, it's like an old man that has a pet turtle.

1822
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:25,420
And so I would play pretend by just curling up

1823
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:28,300
in a ball on the ground and then being the turtle.

1824
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:33,260
And that was how I had fun in that.

1825
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,529
How long was your like, recess?

1826
01:18:36,529 --> 01:18:37,729
Like, 20 minutes.

1827
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:38,529
20 minutes?

1828
01:18:38,529 --> 01:18:46,420
This wasn't recess though.

1829
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,100
This was like, I wouldn't do that at school.

1830
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,060
Kids would have made fun of me.

1831
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,539
This was around close friends.

1832
01:18:53,539 --> 01:18:54,500
Oh, okay, that hurt.

1833
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:55,699
Hold on.

1834
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:57,630
I'm just imagining you at recess.

1835
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:58,109
No, no, no.

1836
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,029
That would have been bad if kids were like,

1837
01:19:00,029 --> 01:19:01,869
why is he being a turtle at recess?

1838
01:19:01,869 --> 01:19:02,189
No, no, no.

1839
01:19:02,189 --> 01:19:02,750
That would have been bad.

1840
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:05,710
That would be like, I mean, who didn't do, wait,

1841
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:08,189
you didn't do the let's pretend to be animals at recess?

1842
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:08,510
Yeah.

1843
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,220
Well, maybe.

1844
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,979
I think, yeah, I definitely did that, I think.

1845
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:13,659
Yeah, that wouldn't be out of the ordinary.

1846
01:19:13,659 --> 01:19:14,060
No, no.

1847
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,979
When my close friends like, hang out at their house,

1848
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:17,899
like our parents are hanging out, right?

1849
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:20,220
Like, so we're just upstairs playing pretend

1850
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,779
and they play Dragon Ball.

1851
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:22,979
I'm like, okay, I'll be the turtle.

1852
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:25,630
Because I didn't care.

1853
01:19:26,609 --> 01:19:31,579
That's awesome.

1854
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,300
Wait, people in chat are saying, you know,

1855
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,340
the things they usually say.

1856
01:19:36,449 --> 01:19:39,250
So wait, there was not one point when you were younger

1857
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,930
at recess where you went around going like this

1858
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:47,380
with your arm, going like, why can't,

1859
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:50,420
you know, are they like an elephant?

1860
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,579
Like, you didn't run around like an elephant

1861
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:54,699
or like a horse or something?

1862
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:55,500
Like, what are you talking about?

1863
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:55,979
Yes, you did.

1864
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,109
I don't know if I, yeah, I mean, I recall like

1865
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:01,630
doing the arm thing, I guess, to be an elephant,

1866
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,789
but I don't know if I like chose to be the elephant.

1867
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:05,550
That was never like one I went for.

1868
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,460
Like, I'm a bear, like, rawr.

1869
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,579
I didn't mane elephant.

1870
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:13,539
I was more of like a cheetah guy or maybe a lion.

1871
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:14,039
Yeah.

1872
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,600
That's not furry behavior.

1873
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,180
That's just your, like, seven.

1874
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:28,060
Yeah, I want to know which furry is like an elephant.

1875
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,180
I've never heard of that before.

1876
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:33,060
Yeah, that definitely exists.

1877
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:40,420
My mane.

1878
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,369
I didn't mane elephant that I did.

1879
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:50,539
Guys, I'm not streaming with a furry.

1880
01:20:50,539 --> 01:20:51,340
It's okay, guys.

1881
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:52,560
Okay.

1882
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:05,060
It's pretending to be Sonic Count.

1883
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,880
I think so.

1884
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,260
I love to be Sonic.

1885
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:13,020
Yeah, but so what, so wait, how come, so when it's a cool animal,

1886
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,420
that's okay, but when it's an elephant, I'm the weird kid.

1887
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,220
What are you talking about?

1888
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,140
You're pretending to be a hedgehog running fast.

1889
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:22,109
Sonic's like super fast, though, and elephants are really slow.

1890
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:22,750
So?

1891
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:26,829
That makes Sonic cooler, though.

1892
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:28,270
He's like the fastest thing ever.

1893
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,039
But it's still a hedgehog.

1894
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:34,220
It's like a different, though.

1895
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:37,420
Like, if you saw like a real hedgehog next to Sonic,

1896
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:43,250
you'd be like, yeah, those are two different things.

1897
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,920
Yeah, that's true.

1898
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,920
Even Sonic doesn't pretend to be a hedgehog.

1899
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,840
Yeah, I don't even know if he is, honestly.

1900
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,470
He might just be insane and thinks that he is.

1901
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,069
We pretended to be Dragon Ball characters.

1902
01:21:57,069 --> 01:21:58,579
Step up your game.

1903
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:01,779
Yeah, but there's all kinds of fun media to pretend to be.

1904
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,279
When are they going to add John Oliver to the game?

1905
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:08,640
He is Warner Bros now.

1906
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,159
That'd be cool.

1907
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:10,720
I don't want to do it.

1908
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,600
Don't make me do it.

1909
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,640
No, don't make me do it.

1910
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,680
Don't make me do John Oliver.

1911
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,399
Don't make me do it.

1912
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,090
Was that the reason that guy came here for the first time to ask me

1913
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:22,050
that was to try to bait me into reading it so that you would do the John Oliver?

1914
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:26,159
I'm not going to do it.

1915
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,359
No, I can't.

1916
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,079
No.

1917
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,539
About John Oliver doing a what's up doc.

1918
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:36,300
All right, gamers.

1919
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,579
I thought that was it.

1920
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:38,460
I was like, wait a minute.

1921
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:41,520
Your time.

1922
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:41,920
It's your time.

1923
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:42,720
You want to go?

1924
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,039
Let's go.

1925
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:43,439
Let's go.

1926
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,340
Who are we going against?

1927
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,859
Stan's in Alpha Red.

1928
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:47,180
All right.

1929
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,770
OK.

1930
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:49,170
All right.

1931
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,689
So go ahead and set that one up.

1932
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:52,369
You can start that up whenever it's ready.

1933
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:52,930
Cool.

1934
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,770
OK.

1935
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,260
I will add them.

1936
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,020
These guys are pretty good at gaming.

1937
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,340
They are?

1938
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,460
Well, so are we.

1939
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,260
We'll be fine.

1940
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,699
We're better at gaming sometimes.

1941
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:06,739
Hey, so are we.

1942
01:23:06,739 --> 01:23:12,720
This could be our day.

1943
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,479
I'm not playing Rhyndog, guys.

1944
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:15,520
I'm not doing that.

1945
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,329
Unless I lose.

1946
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,489
If I lose the first round, I'll play Rhyndog.

1947
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:25,300
Yeah, we'll switch it up before you lose.

1948
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,020
Oh, OK.

1949
01:23:26,979 --> 01:23:32,699
What is Alpha?

1950
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:35,199
There we go.

1951
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:35,680
OK.

1952
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:41,470
Rhyndog be like, mmm, french fry.

1953
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,670
Yeah, he does be like that.

1954
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,630
That's what he does.

1955
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:51,789
All right.

1956
01:23:51,789 --> 01:23:53,229
I've sent them both invites.

1957
01:23:53,229 --> 01:24:07,550
Change profile pics.

1958
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,229
You don't get caught using the Steven Universe one.

1959
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:10,430
Thank you for reminding me.

1960
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:12,159
Oh, oh, shit.

1961
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:21,779
They're in a game.

1962
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:23,460
Oh, they're in a game.

1963
01:24:24,289 --> 01:24:27,899
See, we just talked about, like, playing Pokemon.

1964
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:28,699
We didn't practice.

1965
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:31,869
We could have been practicing this whole time.

1966
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:32,750
We could have.

1967
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,840
Wow, it's been like 20 minutes, too, hasn't it?

1968
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,479
Yep.

1969
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:37,119
Well, whatever.

1970
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,699
I think we're OK.

1971
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:42,539
Did you at least, like, eat more carrots?

1972
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:43,760
I'm on it.

1973
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:50,449
Carrots are wearing off?

1974
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:50,689
Nope.

1975
01:24:50,689 --> 01:25:04,020
I'm going to make sure there's a stream of carrots.

1976
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,539
Wait, Connor, is your birthday?

1977
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:06,979
Is it actually your birthday?

1978
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:07,699
No, it's not.

1979
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:11,010
My birthday is, like, not this Friday.

1980
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:14,109
Two weeks from Friday.

1981
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:14,909
Well, happy birthday.

1982
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:15,710
Happy early birthday.

1983
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,109
Thanks.

1984
01:25:16,109 --> 01:25:20,140
It's my birthday.

1985
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:20,779
Here we go.

1986
01:25:20,779 --> 01:25:21,340
All right.

1987
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,869
All right, let's do a repeat of last time.

1988
01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:29,569
Oh, this guy's got a cool profile picture.

1989
01:25:29,569 --> 01:25:30,369
OK.

1990
01:25:30,369 --> 01:25:37,380
Oh, he's the loony king.

1991
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:41,220
Jerma, do you have that one?

1992
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,260
What's the loony king?

1993
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,850
It's the profile picture Alpharet has.

1994
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:49,470
I think he gets that from being, like, really good at Bugs Bunny, I think.

1995
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:52,079
What?

1996
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,560
Reached mastery level 14 on Bugs Bunny.

1997
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,159
What?

1998
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,600
Are you not mastery level?

1999
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,079
No.

2000
01:25:58,079 --> 01:25:59,279
Oh, no.

2001
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,159
I always get to, like, right before mastery and change character.

2002
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,909
Because I don't want anyone.

2003
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,010
I don't need that to be good.

2004
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,649
Right.

2005
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:09,979
So we can go whenever, right?

2006
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,100
I get really, like, self-conscious about, like, if people can tell that, like, I've

2007
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,619
played the game a good bit in an online game so that I can always have the excuse of, like,

2008
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:20,130
oh, well, like, I don't even play that much.

2009
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,729
Like, get a life, go outside.

2010
01:26:21,729 --> 01:26:23,090
And then, like, I leave the game.

2011
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:24,289
That's what I do in, like, Valorant.

2012
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:27,810
Like, Overwatch.

2013
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:30,210
Let me just make sure.

2014
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:31,409
Should I go right when we're ready?

2015
01:26:31,409 --> 01:26:35,649
Or are we waiting for the go ahead?

2016
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,569
I'm assuming we can start.

2017
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,170
But I could be wrong.

2018
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,390
Change character?

2019
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:46,579
You could try Superman if you want.

2020
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:47,939
I could try Superman.

2021
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:49,710
That's a good call.

2022
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:52,020
I'm going to go Superman.

2023
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:52,739
Change it up.

2024
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:55,840
Here comes the heat.

2025
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:02,340
I don't think I even have perks on Superman, though.

2026
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:02,739
Oh, well.

2027
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:08,260
As long as I'm standing.

2028
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,529
Oh, shit.

2029
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:12,699
Hold on.

2030
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:16,109
Uh-oh.

2031
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:16,829
No way!

2032
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:17,069
Hey!

2033
01:27:17,069 --> 01:27:17,630
It's all right.

2034
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,109
It's all right.

2035
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:19,550
You get time here to do it.

2036
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:24,479
Cool down duration?

2037
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:26,000
What are you playing as?

2038
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,960
Commentary.

2039
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,439
Yeah, yeah.

2040
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:28,560
You can do cool down if you want.

2041
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,119
Cool down.

2042
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:37,039
5% melee damage.

2043
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh, hell no.

2044
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,579
How you guys feeling going into this?

2045
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:42,140
I feel pretty good.

2046
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,039
Level 18 Velma.

2047
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:47,840
I mean, I don't have a perk, which is, you know, should be illegal.

2048
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,960
Oh, they're matching perks, too.

2049
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,250
I would never do that.

2050
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:51,970
Hey, watch this.

2051
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:52,770
We're good.

2052
01:27:52,770 --> 01:28:00,140
Stacking perks is like a sign that, like, you're afraid, I think.

2053
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:02,609
Here we go.

2054
01:28:02,609 --> 01:28:02,930
You ready?

2055
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:03,489
Let's go.

2056
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:03,729
Yep.

2057
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:05,810
I got beta keratin flowing through my bloodstream.

2058
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:35,569
I'm getting gaming stints.

2059
01:28:35,569 --> 01:28:36,069
Shit.

2060
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:46,069
Oh, my God.

2061
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:50,689
The top of my control stick fell off.

2062
01:28:50,689 --> 01:28:51,409
Oh, man.

2063
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:51,909
OK.

2064
01:28:52,289 --> 01:28:52,930
Sorry.

2065
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:57,489
Literally, Jerma, like, the top of the Xbox controller thumbstick fell off.

2066
01:28:57,489 --> 01:28:58,369
You got a controller problem?

2067
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,689
It fell off of the controller.

2068
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,979
There's no stick.

2069
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:23,789
We got to get rid of this fucking Superman.

2070
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:24,829
I know.

2071
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:25,329
I'm trying.

2072
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:29,430
There you go.

2073
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,250
One more time.

2074
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:35,750
What?

2075
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:38,420
Oh, you're being arrested.

2076
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,220
Oh, my goodness gracious.

2077
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:50,750
Good.

2078
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,149
Sorry.

2079
01:29:51,149 --> 01:29:51,630
All together.

2080
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,819
Speed up on the Superman.

2081
01:29:53,819 --> 01:29:55,899
They're going to be hitting gamer fatigue really soon here.

2082
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:56,399
Yep.

2083
01:29:56,779 --> 01:29:57,659
They're too confident.

2084
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:02,460
That's not what I meant to do.

2085
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,600
Oh, I had it.

2086
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:38,979
There it is.

2087
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:39,300
We're good.

2088
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:39,939
Good.

2089
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:40,500
Velma.

2090
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,000
Velma.

2091
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,460
No.

2092
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:10,640
Spiker.

2093
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,140
Sorry.

2094
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:13,600
We almost brought it back.

2095
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,109
We almost brought it back.

2096
01:31:15,109 --> 01:31:15,750
Man, listen.

2097
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,909
If we had host, that spike hits.

2098
01:31:17,909 --> 01:31:18,630
Sorry.

2099
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:19,270
That was a good game.

2100
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,909
Good game.

2101
01:31:19,909 --> 01:31:20,390
Very close.

2102
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,890
Very close.

2103
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,970
Very close.

2104
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:28,470
Oh, my God.

2105
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,970
A 3D2.

2106
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:33,270
All right.

2107
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,069
All right.

2108
01:31:34,069 --> 01:31:34,569
I'm going.

2109
01:31:35,029 --> 01:31:35,510
Here's the plan.

2110
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:37,079
Ready?

2111
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:38,739
I'm going back to Bugs.

2112
01:31:39,539 --> 01:31:40,039
OK.

2113
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,359
No, I think I stay on Tom and Jerry chat.

2114
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:46,560
I know you guys want rindog.

2115
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,640
But I don't think I'm going to win with rindog.

2116
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,920
I don't know how to play that guy.

2117
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,880
And I ran out of carrots.

2118
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,710
This is the part you don't eat.

2119
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:55,170
Oh, no.

2120
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,989
You have to eat it.

2121
01:31:55,989 --> 01:31:57,029
You have to eat it.

2122
01:31:57,029 --> 01:31:58,630
No, it's the part you can't even eat.

2123
01:31:58,630 --> 01:31:59,130
It's the part.

2124
01:31:59,130 --> 01:31:59,670
You have to eat it.

2125
01:31:59,670 --> 01:31:59,989
OK.

2126
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:00,630
Fine.

2127
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:03,880
Hold on.

2128
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,399
Wait.

2129
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:07,760
Let me just do my level up spell.

2130
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,729
What the?

2131
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:12,229
What?

2132
01:32:14,789 --> 01:32:15,289
Whoa.

2133
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:20,359
All right.

2134
01:32:20,359 --> 01:32:21,159
Let's go.

2135
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:25,720
Show them what we got.

2136
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,100
We can pull it back here.

2137
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,819
We're going to win.

2138
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,630
I know you can eat that part.

2139
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:37,189
I'm kidding.

2140
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:38,390
Hey, Connor, even if we lose.

2141
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:42,119
You still want to play multiverse really well?

2142
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:42,680
Yeah, I'm down.

2143
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,340
We're going to win this one right here.

2144
01:32:46,340 --> 01:33:36,529
You ready to get out of that thing?

2145
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,180
Keep it up.

2146
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:44,500
Keep it up.

2147
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:44,979
Keep it up.

2148
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:45,619
OK.

2149
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:46,760
Let's try again.

2150
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:48,359
Tried to bait him.

2151
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:48,760
We're good.

2152
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,079
We're good.

2153
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:49,319
We're good.

2154
01:33:49,319 --> 01:34:01,039
We're good.

2155
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:01,359
Shit.

2156
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:02,960
I tried to deal with him.

2157
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:38,630
We need a spike here.

2158
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:57,760
Ah, fuck that car.

2159
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:11,090
Here we go.

2160
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,649
I got Velma.

2161
01:35:11,649 --> 01:35:12,050
Let's go.

2162
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:12,449
Go, go, go, go.

2163
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,869
She's low.

2164
01:35:14,869 --> 01:35:17,680
How did that not hit him?

2165
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:22,609
He's just baiting us.

2166
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:23,010
He's baiting us.

2167
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:24,210
We got hit Velma.

2168
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:25,760
All right.

2169
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,319
Go, go, go, go, go.

2170
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:30,260
Velma, let's try.

2171
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:36,310
Oh, help.

2172
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:39,220
No.

2173
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:50,960
How do they keep?

2174
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,359
No, no, no.

2175
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:51,920
We got it.

2176
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,960
Oh, sorry.

2177
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,279
Sorry.

2178
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,840
I don't understand.

2179
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,319
Damn it.

2180
01:35:56,319 --> 01:35:57,199
I missed the spike.

2181
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,319
If I didn't miss the spike, we would have won.

2182
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:00,159
Oh, fuck.

2183
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,319
I missed the spike.

2184
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:03,439
I just don't understand.

2185
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:04,960
Things that usually work weren't working.

2186
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,880
You guys are doing great.

2187
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,880
Honestly, their strat of having Velma in the back,

2188
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,640
Superman in the front was pretty hard to deal with.

2189
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,960
And I think you guys adapted pretty well.

2190
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,840
I'm saying that we're the most honest team in the tournament

2191
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,279
is what people have been saying, actually,

2192
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:21,239
is that Tom and Jerry and Bugs is potentially the most ethical.

2193
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,600
Ethically and morally, I think you guys are in the lead.

2194
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:30,920
I have mixed feelings about Batman deciding to kill in this game

2195
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,729
after signing a lifelong vow.

2196
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:36,039
So yeah, you guys are spot on.

2197
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:36,359
It's true.

2198
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:38,039
That was a good match.

2199
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:38,840
We almost had it.

2200
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,079
Well, you guys are free to go.

2201
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:44,579
Thanks for your playing.

2202
01:36:44,579 --> 01:36:44,979
Thanks.

2203
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,239
I still have like $100.

2204
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,560
Wait, does fifth place get anything?

2205
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,390
Are we fifth place, fourth place?

2206
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:55,439
You guys are fifth place, tied for fifth.

2207
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:00,579
You get nothing at all, but a big high five.

2208
01:37:00,579 --> 01:37:02,800
OK, that's a high five.

2209
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,600
It's fine.

2210
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,479
So not bad.

2211
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:05,199
Not bad.

2212
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,329
Anyway, enjoy the rest of your streams, gentlemen.

2213
01:37:07,329 --> 01:37:08,210
Yeah, thanks for the invite.

2214
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,529
Every time you've been here, I've been chewing on a carrot.

2215
01:37:12,529 --> 01:37:13,970
I feel like that's rude.

2216
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,409
I think you do it after every game,

2217
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:19,399
and that's just when I come in.

2218
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:22,760
Yo, we got to invite you guys.

2219
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:27,750
We're next up.

2220
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:30,550
This is Dr. Battle and Sheep for Hire.

2221
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:30,949
We lost.

2222
01:37:30,949 --> 01:37:31,590
We won.

2223
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:32,310
Oh, you lost?

2224
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:32,630
I'm sorry.

2225
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,989
I thought I was going to be one.

2226
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:34,789
I marked the bracket wrong.

2227
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:37,270
Oh, he marked the bracket wrong.

2228
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,750
Sorry.

2229
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,149
I thought we were going to play.

2230
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:39,670
I was just looking at the bracket.

2231
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:40,149
I'm sorry, guys.

2232
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:42,149
Yeah, we went off script, actually.

2233
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:44,789
I didn't mean to do that to you.

2234
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,600
I was rooting for you guys right after us.

2235
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,199
We're Stans haters.

2236
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,079
We hate Stans.

2237
01:37:52,119 --> 01:37:53,640
Wait, I love the Stans show.

2238
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,760
Calm down, all right?

2239
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,640
The Stans show's dead.

2240
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,600
That's why we hate them.

2241
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,199
Task manager was better, they say.

2242
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,710
Where are you guys in the bracket right now?

2243
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:01,989
We're up against the Stans.

2244
01:38:01,989 --> 01:38:02,630
Oh, all right.

2245
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:03,270
Okay.

2246
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:06,390
Yeah, we got our ring game.

2247
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,510
Connor, we tied with you.

2248
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:12,239
You want to, for honor, do you guys want to, you know, just go onward?

2249
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,060
Do you want to decide for fourth place?

2250
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,020
Yeah, I'm tied with you.

2251
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,739
Yeah, I'm down.

2252
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:17,779
Yeah, let's decide fourth place.

2253
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:19,300
Let's do it.

2254
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,819
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2255
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:22,020
Connor eats pants, yeah?

2256
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:25,159
Yeah, no, Connor from Dream SMP.

2257
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:26,039
Okay, got it.

2258
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:28,359
I've already sent you a request.

2259
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:31,000
Wait, you're the, you were on the Dream SMP, weren't you?

2260
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:32,680
I am on the Dream SMP.

2261
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,880
Oh, R, okay, wow.

2262
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,020
Like, wait, so do you know Schlatt?

2263
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,140
Yes, yes.

2264
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,979
Dude, no way.

2265
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:41,619
I think you're the four, like, Valor guy, stolen Valor.

2266
01:38:41,619 --> 01:38:43,060
Sorry, Jerma, this happens a lot.

2267
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:43,779
There's a lot of-

2268
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:45,539
Oh my God, dude.

2269
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:46,659
Yes, hey guys.

2270
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:48,659
My younger sister loves you guys.

2271
01:38:48,659 --> 01:38:49,619
I know, probably.

2272
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:52,420
I'll invite you to the lobby.

2273
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,579
She was wondering when you're going to start posting

2274
01:38:54,579 --> 01:38:55,859
Minecraft YouTube videos, though?

2275
01:38:56,739 --> 01:38:59,270
Tell her that, tell her Connor eats pants.

2276
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:00,949
He retired, he's a new guy now.

2277
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:04,119
They recasted him, he's different now.

2278
01:39:05,489 --> 01:39:06,770
Who's playing him now?

2279
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:09,119
Jared Leto, I think.

2280
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,079
That's crazy.

2281
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:10,960
No, hopefully not.

2282
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,319
I didn't approve of that.

2283
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:15,479
Well, you don't have to, you don't have to approve of them, really.

2284
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:16,119
Well.

2285
01:39:16,119 --> 01:39:17,560
You don't like Jared Leto?

2286
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,000
No.

2287
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,840
Andy Carrot, someone's really upset that-

2288
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:23,920
Yeah, that's all I have.

2289
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,399
I'm just like, oh, remember the guy that was at the multiverse tournament,

2290
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,119
that ate carrots, like, that was what was funny?

2291
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:32,229
Oh, there's like fucking like a hundred thousand people

2292
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:33,829
probably concurrently watching the stream.

2293
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:35,270
I'm the funny guy that chews the carrot.

2294
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:38,079
Yeah, like that's all I have right now.

2295
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:39,760
It's literally the only thing I have today.

2296
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,359
We'll just run at random.

2297
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:43,859
Cool.

2298
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:46,880
This is for all the glory.

2299
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,079
It's for all the fourth place.

2300
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:50,470
This is to get the one point in Mario Kart.

2301
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:55,409
I said that I would gift fourth place a sub, each of them a sub to Amaranth.

2302
01:39:55,409 --> 01:39:56,359
Okay.

2303
01:39:56,359 --> 01:39:56,859
Okay.

2304
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,039
I didn't say that.

2305
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:02,600
You say you're already subbed, Connor?

2306
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,159
Oh, yeah, no, I'm like on a 14 month streak, I think.

2307
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:06,899
And it's tier three, right?

2308
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:08,659
No, no, I don't have it like that.

2309
01:40:08,659 --> 01:40:09,300
Ready to go?

2310
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,340
Oh, I'll tell you what, I'll tier three, yeah, then we'll do that.

2311
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:15,979
Okay.

2312
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:17,920
Good luck, guys.

2313
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,399
Good luck, guys.

2314
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:23,619
All right, I think we stayed, we stayed, what we got?

2315
01:40:23,619 --> 01:40:28,899
Oh, they wanted to play Rhyme Dog.

2316
01:40:28,899 --> 01:40:30,710
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

2317
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:31,750
Maybe next time.

2318
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,680
Are you guys going for fifth?

2319
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:38,979
No, this is fourth.

2320
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:41,380
All I want is the one point in fourth place at Mario Kart.

2321
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,100
That's all I care about.

2322
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:43,680
Cause then-

2323
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,960
Did you eat another carrot?

2324
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:45,460
Yeah.

2325
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,220
Good.

2326
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,720
Cause then we placed, right?

2327
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,279
If you come in fourth place, you place.

2328
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:55,279
Well, like do we win something?

2329
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:56,560
Cause I don't think so.

2330
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,279
No.

2331
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:03,239
But like we do place fourth, which is like right below like top three.

2332
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:04,680
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

2333
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,680
Yeah, it's for fifth, not fourth.

2334
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,880
Oh, okay.

2335
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:10,840
Well, top five.

2336
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:17,750
These guys don't even have any perks.

2337
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,979
Well, let's get that fourth place.

2338
01:41:22,979 --> 01:41:25,409
Put on your chapstick.

2339
01:41:25,409 --> 01:41:27,189
How did the top come off the controller?

2340
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:31,569
I have the Xbox Elite controller so you can switch out the thumbsticks.

2341
01:41:31,569 --> 01:41:35,409
And then I was gaming so hard that the left one popped off and it was just a little nub.

2342
01:41:36,050 --> 01:42:08,210
Let's go for it.

2343
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:08,449
All right.

2344
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:09,090
Get that.

2345
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,930
Oh, nice attempt.

2346
01:42:11,729 --> 01:42:14,420
They almost had it.

2347
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:15,560
Yep.

2348
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:23,600
It cost them their items.

2349
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:26,310
Where the hell did this come from?

2350
01:42:26,949 --> 01:42:28,800
Oh, that's you, right?

2351
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:29,760
You can pull out an item.

2352
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,260
Yep.

2353
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:38,319
Oh, I got him.

2354
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:39,840
I got him early too.

2355
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,550
Oh, I could have gone for the counter.

2356
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:53,189
There it is.

2357
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:55,109
Dude, you are on point this game.

2358
01:42:55,109 --> 01:42:55,609
Yep.

2359
01:43:36,789 --> 01:43:37,270
There it is.

2360
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:37,829
Nice stuff.

2361
01:43:37,829 --> 01:43:38,550
There we go.

2362
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:39,590
You were on point that game.

2363
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:40,789
I was gaming.

2364
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:44,289
I probably did like 30 damage that game.

2365
01:43:44,289 --> 01:43:45,090
You're probably like 500.

2366
01:43:46,449 --> 01:43:47,409
You hard carried that game.

2367
01:43:47,409 --> 01:43:48,289
This place matters.

2368
01:43:51,329 --> 01:43:52,369
Four KOs, damn.

2369
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:55,800
Nice game.

2370
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,060
That was good.

2371
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,159
All right.

2372
01:43:58,159 --> 01:43:59,199
I'll play Rhyndog now, guys.

2373
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,210
We got to solidify the win.

2374
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:06,069
You don't want to play Rhyndog?

2375
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:08,069
You can play Rhyndog when we're just goofing around.

2376
01:44:08,069 --> 01:44:08,550
Oh, okay.

2377
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:09,510
That's fair.

2378
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:10,149
See, I agree.

2379
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,430
They were just...

2380
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,989
Some people were really...

2381
01:44:11,989 --> 01:44:14,149
There was like two Rhyndog fans that were really losing it.

2382
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,800
He's literally like an original character.

2383
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,319
Somebody just said, suck my ass.

2384
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:24,770
Time that person up for like 35 seconds.

2385
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,970
That's probably one of mine.

2386
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:32,930
That's probably one of mine.

2387
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:36,050
Yeah, that sounds like something one of my guys would say.

2388
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:42,069
35 seconds or 35 years?

2389
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,859
Somewhere in between.

2390
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:45,859
Let's take the average.

2391
01:44:45,859 --> 01:44:49,640
All right, we got to solidify fourth place.

2392
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,000
I'm happy with fourth place if we get it.

2393
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,760
He's like a reindeer dog.

2394
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,270
I just now realized that.

2395
01:45:02,069 --> 01:45:25,140
I'm trying to get the early knockout.

2396
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,449
Hit that spike.

2397
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:54,319
There it is.

2398
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:54,800
Oh, what?

2399
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,279
I guess not.

2400
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:56,720
I almost got it.

2401
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:15,010
There it is.

2402
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:15,489
Nice job.

2403
01:46:15,489 --> 01:46:15,890
All right, get it.

2404
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:16,289
Double it up.

2405
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:27,810
There it is.

2406
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:28,369
Nice job.

2407
01:46:28,369 --> 01:46:28,689
Okay.

2408
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,979
We've done it again.

2409
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:32,960
That was a good fight.

2410
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,159
That was good.

2411
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:34,640
We did it.

2412
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:35,920
Fifth place.

2413
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,800
No, this is fourth.

2414
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,119
Looks like somebody is a sore loser.

2415
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,399
They kept saying it was for fit.

2416
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:43,600
You carried again.

2417
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,640
Yeah, no, I just wanted to...

2418
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:46,640
Yeah, we just wanted to goof.

2419
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,000
Gift you a sub to Amaranth, really.

2420
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,479
I'm just...

2421
01:46:49,479 --> 01:46:49,880
Thank you.

2422
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,199
Good games.

2423
01:46:50,199 --> 01:46:50,520
Good games.

2424
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:51,239
Appreciate it.

2425
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:52,520
Trying to fund you guys.

2426
01:46:53,319 --> 01:46:55,399
Let me just get those going real quick.

2427
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:56,920
Let me just exit out of multiverse.

2428
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:57,800
This is a bad game.

2429
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,600
You know what I mean?

2430
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,180
That's a great game.

2431
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,140
No, it's bad.

2432
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:02,020
I think it's phenomenal.

2433
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,699
It's a fantastic video game.

2434
01:47:03,699 --> 01:47:04,420
It is.

2435
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,140
All right.

2436
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:05,380
Well...

2437
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:06,420
It's truly great.

2438
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,800
Jerma, what are you eating?

2439
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,409
Ham sandwich.

2440
01:47:11,409 --> 01:47:12,760
Any cheese?

2441
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:13,560
No, no cheese.

2442
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,979
Just mustard.

2443
01:47:14,979 --> 01:47:15,939
Just mustard and ham.

2444
01:47:15,939 --> 01:47:16,500
I like it.

2445
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,859
Mustard ham and two...

2446
01:47:17,859 --> 01:47:18,819
Man of class.

2447
01:47:18,819 --> 01:47:20,899
One piece of whole wheat bread.

2448
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:23,880
You don't even have two?

2449
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,640
It's almost like a hot dog.

2450
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:27,800
Your bread lasts a lot longer that way.

2451
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,289
I mean, I guess that's true.

2452
01:47:30,289 --> 01:47:32,050
Is it a wrap then, almost?

2453
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:35,409
You could fold it and eat it like a slice of pizza.

2454
01:47:35,409 --> 01:47:38,210
Interesting that you went with pizza on the fold it one.

2455
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:40,770
And it's ham and mustard.

2456
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,729
Ham, mustard, one piece of whole wheat.

2457
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:45,250
Fold it up like a piece of pizza.

2458
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:48,100
Take a bite, you're golden.

2459
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,170
Maybe a little smoothie.

2460
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,569
Honor, here's your tier...

2461
01:47:51,569 --> 01:47:53,729
I can't give the tier three to you.

2462
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:55,250
Open face liar.

2463
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,569
Told you, I'm already a son.

2464
01:47:57,569 --> 01:47:59,060
Wait, you're lying?

2465
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,100
No, dude.

2466
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,659
I just gifted Connor Eats Pant.

2467
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,100
No, no, no, no.

2468
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:04,420
Fuck.

2469
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:06,579
Connor.

2470
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:12,579
That is a 25 dollars down the drain there.

2471
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,359
Oh, no.

2472
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:15,489
Okay.

2473
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:20,159
That is too bad.

2474
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:21,920
You're not a sub, you piece of shit.

2475
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,960
So I just...

2476
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,060
Whoa.

2477
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:25,699
Is this edible?

2478
01:48:27,779 --> 01:48:28,579
You're taking an edible?

2479
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:29,699
What?

2480
01:48:29,699 --> 01:48:31,140
No, I said, is this edible?

2481
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:33,939
The tier three sub?

2482
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:37,060
This piece of this carrot.

2483
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,470
This is not even a carrot.

2484
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,069
This is like fucking spinach.

2485
01:48:40,069 --> 01:48:44,020
Oh, it was for the aesthetic.

2486
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:45,350
And that's what it was.

2487
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:48,949
Jerma, would you both go to...

2488
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:52,180
Let me just make sure I don't type in the wrong one.

2489
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:54,500
Jerma, nine, eight, five, right.

2490
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,899
Would you guys do me a favor and go to her stream

2491
01:48:56,899 --> 01:48:59,699
to validate that I have, in fact, given you tier three emotes?

2492
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,479
I'll find out.

2493
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:03,880
Why can't I gift you a sub, Jerma?

2494
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,689
I don't know.

2495
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:05,170
Give me one?

2496
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,699
I might have already been gifted this years.

2497
01:49:09,699 --> 01:49:10,369
Okay.

2498
01:49:10,369 --> 01:49:13,300
Is there another streamer that you would like a gifted sub to?

2499
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:17,960
Um, Conrad Smith.

2500
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:18,840
My God.

2501
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,479
Incredible choice.

2502
01:49:21,479 --> 01:49:22,359
My God.

2503
01:49:22,359 --> 01:49:23,909
Holy shit.

2504
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:24,310
Jerma.

2505
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:27,380
Wait, I might be subbed to you too.

2506
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:31,090
Wait, let's see.

2507
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:32,210
Jerma, nine, eight, five.

2508
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:35,560
Hey, I've got a chat I don't think he's subbed to.

2509
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,199
No, you're good.

2510
01:49:36,199 --> 01:49:36,680
I got it.

2511
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:37,239
I got it.

2512
01:49:37,239 --> 01:49:37,640
Oh, okay.

2513
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:37,960
Here you go.

2514
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:38,359
Got it.

2515
01:49:38,359 --> 01:49:38,680
Okay.

2516
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:39,079
Not.

2517
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:39,560
Okay.

2518
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,359
That sucks.

2519
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:40,760
There you go.

2520
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:41,640
Now you can use the...

2521
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:43,810
What do you have?

2522
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:44,770
A gold car?

2523
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:45,489
You got it.

2524
01:49:45,489 --> 01:49:46,770
Yeah, you got the gold frog.

2525
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:47,329
Oh, shit.

2526
01:49:47,329 --> 01:49:47,729
There it is.

2527
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:48,609
It's a tier three.

2528
01:49:48,609 --> 01:49:49,970
I thought we were doing tier one.

2529
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:50,289
All right.

2530
01:49:50,289 --> 01:49:51,649
No, tier threes.

2531
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:55,810
I think there's an emote of just some guy's face for tier three too.

2532
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:57,890
Wait, let me do some emotes.

2533
01:49:57,890 --> 01:50:00,869
All right.

2534
01:50:00,869 --> 01:50:01,189
Let me try.

2535
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,670
Where are we?

2536
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:07,090
All right.

2537
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,829
So what's the tier three?

2538
01:50:09,829 --> 01:50:11,829
Connor six, that guy's face.

2539
01:50:11,829 --> 01:50:15,140
Connor six, that guy's face is what I typed.

2540
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:15,859
Okay.

2541
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:16,500
Yeah, there's shit.

2542
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:20,100
Well, it's like capital T and then G and then...

2543
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,779
Connor six, that guy's face.

2544
01:50:21,779 --> 01:50:26,020
Connor, in your chat, can you use a tier three emote so we can...

2545
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,159
I got to see that guy's face.

2546
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,520
What is that guy's face?

2547
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:34,310
So I did an emote contest and then like he submitted like emote ideas

2548
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:37,189
and then one guy just submitted a photo of his face

2549
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:39,189
and then it ended up winning for like tier three.

2550
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,710
Really?

2551
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:41,270
That's incredible.

2552
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:44,310
Now there's an emote that's just that guy's face that I...

2553
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:45,829
Connor six, that guy's face.

2554
01:50:45,829 --> 01:50:47,189
How many of these can I do?

2555
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:47,989
There you go.

2556
01:50:47,989 --> 01:50:48,310
Okay.

2557
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:49,109
Well, there he is.

2558
01:50:50,069 --> 01:50:50,789
There you go.

2559
01:50:50,789 --> 01:50:51,270
There we go.

2560
01:50:53,029 --> 01:50:54,069
What does Ammo have?

2561
01:50:54,069 --> 01:50:55,189
Does she have that guy's face?

2562
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:56,069
I don't think so.

2563
01:50:56,069 --> 01:50:57,170
Maybe, we'll see.

2564
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:00,560
All right.

2565
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,800
Well, we're going to go play online.

2566
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,000
I will see you guys.

2567
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,600
Yeah, you guys have two letters.

2568
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,079
Good match.

2569
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:06,399
I appreciate it.

2570
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:06,960
Good games.

2571
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,479
Yeah, have a good game, guys.

2572
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:09,920
Thanks for the tier three.

2573
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:10,800
Yeah, dude.

2574
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,279
No problem.

2575
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:11,760
Anytime.

2576
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,300
Get some good emotes now.

2577
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,340
Nice to meet you.

2578
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:17,319
Yeah, you too.

2579
01:51:17,319 --> 01:51:17,720
All right.

2580
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:19,960
Let's show them up online.

2581
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,960
Let's show the public matches.

2582
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:22,680
You want to do some public?

2583
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:25,640
Yeah, let's do some public matches.

2584
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,079
We can just leave this right here.

2585
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:29,039
I think so.

2586
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:29,840
I think I can.

2587
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,039
Oh, I got to pull you in again.

2588
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,399
Oh, yeah.

2589
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:34,279
I think so.

2590
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:37,829
There we go.

2591
01:51:37,829 --> 01:51:41,109
I had to verify that was the real Scarlet Otter.

2592
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:44,789
Yeah, so we got fourth place.

2593
01:51:44,789 --> 01:51:45,510
I'm OK with that.

2594
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:48,819
Let's solidify that.

2595
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:50,420
Fourth place is fine.

2596
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,859
Maybe in the next one, we get third.

2597
01:51:55,329 --> 01:51:56,449
That's all right.

2598
01:51:56,449 --> 01:51:58,369
Once they add Johnny Bravo to the game.

2599
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,289
Wait, how was it fifth place?

2600
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:05,140
Is it really fifth?

2601
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:05,460
No.

2602
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:06,500
I'll say that.

2603
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:09,250
How many teams were there?

2604
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,449
I thought there was six teams.

2605
01:52:19,779 --> 01:52:20,899
You tied for fifth.

2606
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:22,739
Four and a half place.

2607
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:26,069
Fourth loses to third.

2608
01:52:26,069 --> 01:52:28,920
The tie was between fifth and sixth.

2609
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,279
Oh, there were eight teams.

2610
01:52:30,279 --> 01:52:34,310
Oh, so now wouldn't we be tied for fourth?

2611
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:42,500
Four and a half.

2612
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:43,619
We're four and a half.

2613
01:52:43,619 --> 01:52:44,500
Oh, well, whatever.

2614
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,220
That's right in the middle.

2615
01:52:45,779 --> 01:52:47,380
Why is the streamer so awkward?

2616
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,500
That's just how I am, dude.

2617
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,300
That's just like my phone.

2618
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:49,779
Who said that?

2619
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:51,699
Did they say that in my channel?

2620
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:52,819
No.

2621
01:52:52,819 --> 01:52:53,619
Better not have.

2622
01:52:53,619 --> 01:53:00,640
Buy the Rhyndog skin.

2623
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,270
No, we didn't even win the tournament, guys.

2624
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:05,590
I don't have enough to buy the Rhyndog skin.

2625
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:08,579
Oh, these guys have the buff.

2626
01:53:11,539 --> 01:53:12,180
They have what?

2627
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:12,659
Oh, yeah.

2628
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:13,779
Wait, is that actually a thing?

2629
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:15,359
No.

2630
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:18,800
Because I kept committing, too.

2631
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,239
And I was like, wait, maybe he's serious

2632
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,239
because we're getting kind of screwed up on this stage.

2633
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:24,479
No, Velma is just really good.

2634
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:25,439
Velma is really good.

2635
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:31,670
Bugs is really good, too.

2636
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:34,310
If you know what you're doing with Velma, you are terrifying.

2637
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,159
Whoa.

2638
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,199
I don't know what that does.

2639
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,000
That was kind of crazy.

2640
01:53:48,689 --> 01:53:50,130
I'm just pressing buttons.

2641
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:56,840
And maybe I'm a Rhyndog guy.

2642
01:53:57,779 --> 01:53:58,260
You might be.

2643
01:54:10,869 --> 01:54:11,270
Whoa.

2644
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:12,789
How did he just didn't go off the screen?

2645
01:54:12,789 --> 01:54:13,270
That was weird.

2646
01:54:14,069 --> 01:54:19,239
Well, he's dead.

2647
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,409
Why would I hit him up?

2648
01:54:23,409 --> 01:54:26,000
The Rhyndog is awesome.

2649
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:29,939
You like Rhyndog?

2650
01:54:29,939 --> 01:54:30,739
He's awesome.

2651
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:31,460
He's a little dog.

2652
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:35,060
I don't know.

2653
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:36,659
What noise does Rhyndog make?

2654
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:37,699
He's a reindeer dog.

2655
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:40,439
Yeah, I don't know.

2656
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:41,239
Rhyndog?

2657
01:54:41,239 --> 01:54:42,119
Oh, that makes a lot more sense.

2658
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:43,560
You got all four KOs.

2659
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,239
Man.

2660
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:46,920
Yeah, the Rhyndog thing.

2661
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:50,630
The person just said, wait, I need to eat?

2662
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:52,880
Did they just write that?

2663
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,439
What?

2664
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:54,800
This person just said, I got to go.

2665
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,600
I have to eat.

2666
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,409
I have to eat dinner or something.

2667
01:54:57,409 --> 01:54:59,380
Are they not allowed to go eat?

2668
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:01,220
Was that like an emote?

2669
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,720
It had an emote that said it.

2670
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,680
What are you talking about?

2671
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,760
Jake just said, hey, I got to go.

2672
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,800
I got to eat.

2673
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,840
Oh, OK.

2674
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,239
I see.

2675
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:13,119
I thought you're saying somebody in your chat said an emote that said,

2676
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:13,600
I got to go eat.

2677
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:14,800
I was like, what are you talking about?

2678
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,960
What did it take up with the whole chat?

2679
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,720
I was like, yeah, it's kind of a weird emote.

2680
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,680
Hey, I got to go.

2681
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,640
I've got to go eat.

2682
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,399
It's like a 50-part emote.

2683
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,960
Just if you leave the game, they have some dialogue sometimes.

2684
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,239
This is a great choice.

2685
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:31,039
Holy joy.

2686
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:37,010
I forgot to.

2687
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:42,479
I didn't pick Rain Dog.

2688
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:43,439
That's so surreal.

2689
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:51,649
Make sure you're filling up your thing.

2690
01:55:51,649 --> 01:55:52,449
Wait, get this off.

2691
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:57,939
I'll put the Burger King guy on.

2692
01:55:59,539 --> 01:56:11,199
I think I'm going to try this game.

2693
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:12,000
You actually should.

2694
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,880
The game's fantastic.

2695
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,560
Genuinely speaking, the game's very good.

2696
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:24,869
It's really fun.

2697
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:28,500
Oh, we're not sponsored today, guys.

2698
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:28,819
Sorry.

2699
01:56:28,819 --> 01:56:29,779
That's not what this is.

2700
01:56:29,779 --> 01:56:30,739
This is not sponsored.

2701
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,640
We're just playing.

2702
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,189
I liked the game before I was sponsored.

2703
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:35,909
You know what?

2704
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:37,159
Me too.

2705
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:39,560
I played it back when it was first in that little alpha.

2706
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:40,279
They did whatever it was.

2707
01:56:41,539 --> 01:56:43,460
Don't you come talking smack to me.

2708
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:54,760
That basketball just ruined everything he was doing.

2709
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,810
You went Daffy in this game, right?

2710
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:58,609
Oh, so bad.

2711
01:56:59,329 --> 01:57:00,520
That'd be cool.

2712
01:57:01,159 --> 01:57:05,779
It'd be cool if he had Duck Dodger's moves, too.

2713
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:11,619
Missed that one.

2714
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:12,659
My bad.

2715
01:57:18,039 --> 01:57:19,239
What the what?

2716
01:57:19,239 --> 01:57:25,720
Oh, my goodness.

2717
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,079
Your favorite Looney Tunes episode?

2718
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:50,079
Um, it's it's Tiny Tunes.

2719
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:52,079
It's how I spent my summer vacation from franchise.

2720
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,239
Oh, I used to love Tiny Tunes.

2721
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:58,319
They were like different.

2722
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,039
They weren't even like it wasn't bugs.

2723
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:02,079
It was like different rabbits.

2724
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,479
Yeah, they were like it was how I spent my summer vacation.

2725
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:08,840
Happy Worldland.

2726
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:14,199
It was the Flucky and Porky the Pig's son.

2727
01:58:15,239 --> 01:58:16,039
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2728
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,819
I don't know what you're talking about.

2729
01:58:18,819 --> 01:58:20,819
I liked for Looney Tunes.

2730
01:58:20,819 --> 01:58:25,439
I like the one where like bugs like ghost like different.

2731
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:26,720
Forgive me what it was.

2732
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,199
Like different animation that mostly looks like it's like trap.

2733
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:31,840
And then no, is it is it Daffy that does it at the end?

2734
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,000
He's like, I can't even remember how to recall it.

2735
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,760
Someone knows what I'm talking about.

2736
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,979
Daffy gets like stuck in like something.

2737
01:58:41,699 --> 01:58:42,199
Sorry.

2738
01:58:42,579 --> 01:58:43,539
Sorry if I startled you.

2739
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:44,659
No, you're fine.

2740
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:50,340
Maybe so.

2741
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:51,060
I don't know the name.

2742
01:58:51,779 --> 01:58:58,869
How am I still here?

2743
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:01,039
There we go.

2744
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:12,479
Oh, I missed it.

2745
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:17,479
I can't believe LeBron James in this game.

2746
01:59:18,279 --> 01:59:18,840
It's crazy.

2747
01:59:22,369 --> 01:59:25,250
He thinks the next real person will add besides John Oliver.

2748
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,130
So you don't have to do it.

2749
01:59:31,079 --> 01:59:32,199
Okay, the next real person.

2750
01:59:34,149 --> 01:59:34,649
Gandalf.

2751
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:36,859
Gandalf.

2752
01:59:37,399 --> 01:59:39,000
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

2753
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,199
I mean, Gandalf is a the depiction of Gandalf.

2754
01:59:42,199 --> 01:59:44,680
They're going to use in this is like a real guy.

2755
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:46,560
They're just going to use Ian McKellen.

2756
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,489
Yeah, it's just Ian.

2757
01:59:49,489 --> 01:59:53,010
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if like they can't get the rights to like Gandalf

2758
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:53,970
and Tolkien Estate.

2759
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:58,710
So they just put in Ian McKellen and he has like some like wizard moves here and there.

2760
01:59:58,710 --> 01:59:59,750
Gandalf would be awesome.

2761
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:03,520
Shaggy is not a real guy.

2762
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,720
He's a cartoon character.

2763
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,159
He's not a real person.

2764
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:08,079
Actually, no, he is in the movies.

2765
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:18,579
I kind of wish they just had like Shaggy that isn't like the meme Shaggy.

2766
02:00:19,539 --> 02:00:21,779
Like a Shaggy that's fighting with Scooby or something.

2767
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,100
There's no way Scooby Doo is not in the game.

2768
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:26,399
Yeah, that's crazy to me.

2769
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:29,199
But I would have liked like Shaggy and Scooby as like a duo team

2770
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:43,510
rather than like, oh, he's like he's like doing the meme like sing Tiny Tunes.

2771
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:46,239
See if I can remember it.

2772
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:51,079
We're tiny.

2773
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:51,720
We're toony.

2774
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:53,159
We're all a little loony.

2775
02:00:53,159 --> 02:00:53,960
Oh, my God.

2776
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:56,199
And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.

2777
02:01:00,449 --> 02:01:00,930
Fuck.

2778
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,250
Hold on.

2779
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:01,489
I lost.

2780
02:01:01,489 --> 02:01:02,289
I couldn't remember it.

2781
02:01:02,289 --> 02:01:04,279
And then you immediately brought it back to me.

2782
02:01:04,279 --> 02:01:05,000
We're tiny.

2783
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,640
We're toony.

2784
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,000
We're all a little loony.

2785
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,340
And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.

2786
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:20,529
We cracked up all the sensors and Tiny Tune Adventures in a dose of harmony

2787
02:01:20,529 --> 02:01:25,380
when in Acme Acres, it's a whole wide world apart

2788
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:29,380
that sets alone and made of stone and cartoon work of art.

2789
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:32,050
Expect the expected.

2790
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:33,649
Expect the unexpected.

2791
02:01:33,649 --> 02:01:36,130
With Tiny Tune Adventures, it's about to start.

2792
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:38,520
I don't know.

2793
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:39,159
It's something like that.

2794
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,130
Oh, we're doing double.

2795
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:43,250
I just realized what we're doing.

2796
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:52,369
The thing I like doing with the brawn is you just bounce one of the balls down

2797
02:01:52,369 --> 02:01:53,569
and then you steal another.

2798
02:01:53,569 --> 02:01:54,609
So that just stays out.

2799
02:01:54,609 --> 02:01:57,170
There is like a thing that they keep bouncing into.

2800
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,810
This is hell here, by the way, especially having to deal with this here.

2801
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,550
What?

2802
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:20,560
What?

2803
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:25,090
How did I live?

2804
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:28,199
Oh, my goodness.

2805
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:28,680
This dude.

2806
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:31,989
Wow.

2807
02:02:31,989 --> 02:02:32,310
We.

2808
02:02:45,079 --> 02:02:45,399
Whoa.

2809
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:45,800
We.

2810
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,279
That was weird.

2811
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:56,500
You think LeBron even knows he's in this game or like when he signed this space jam contract,

2812
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,020
it was like this was in here.

2813
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,460
He didn't know this was here.

2814
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,420
And he didn't know.

2815
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:01,380
That's wicked funny.

2816
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:17,279
Oh, he's just begging to be knocked over there.

2817
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:17,840
OK, we're good.

2818
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:26,359
Imagine like his son's like playing this game with his friends.

2819
02:03:26,359 --> 02:03:27,720
He walks through and he's like, is that me?

2820
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,720
He's like, yeah, like you're in the game.

2821
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,960
Do you think he's just like, all right, whatever.

2822
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:33,800
Probably.

2823
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,600
He has his voice.

2824
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:35,720
He's like, is that me?

2825
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,199
I can't tell.

2826
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:39,319
Is it me talking?

2827
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:41,510
I don't remember recording this.

2828
02:03:42,069 --> 02:03:48,340
Please change Omega L2.

2829
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:51,140
Wowee.

2830
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,739
It's not his voice.

2831
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:55,140
Wait, it's an actor.

2832
02:03:56,279 --> 02:03:58,600
Yeah, it's not LeBron that voices him.

2833
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:02,399
So there's a very real possibility that he does not know he's in this game.

2834
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:03,439
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2835
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:04,159
You're right.

2836
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:04,399
Wow.

2837
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:04,960
OK.

2838
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:07,760
Did you see space jam too?

2839
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,880
No, it was probably one of the worst movies ever seen.

2840
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:12,880
It was really that bad.

2841
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:16,159
I saw that movie and I enjoyed the first space jam as a kid.

2842
02:04:16,159 --> 02:04:18,800
I know it's not great looking, but I was like, OK, it's fine.

2843
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,840
Fun movie.

2844
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,319
This one is just so unapologetically awful.

2845
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:23,439
It hurt me.

2846
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:25,199
Like I was in the theater.

2847
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,560
I'm like, wow, this is upsetting.

2848
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,399
Like, I actually want my money back.

2849
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:29,199
What was wrong with it?

2850
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:31,760
It was just none of the jokes were good.

2851
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,840
The Looney Tunes weren't even like the Looney.

2852
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:37,619
They didn't do any Looney Tunes like funny bits.

2853
02:04:37,619 --> 02:04:42,100
They were just kind of like character archetypes that weren't the Looney Tunes.

2854
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:42,420
Really?

2855
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,359
Yeah, it was very weird.

2856
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:47,319
And then like LeBron is like his performance is awful.

2857
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:52,600
I hate to say it, but he doesn't know how to like, you know, do that.

2858
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,600
He doesn't know how to talk the Looney Tunes.

2859
02:04:55,239 --> 02:05:00,470
And then also like E3 was like a major like plot point of the film.

2860
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:01,109
It didn't make any sense.

2861
02:05:01,109 --> 02:05:01,430
Hold on.

2862
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,470
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2863
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:04,789
E E3 E3.

2864
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:05,189
Yeah.

2865
02:05:05,189 --> 02:05:08,869
So LeBron's son is like, dad, I want to go to E3 camp.

2866
02:05:08,869 --> 02:05:12,000
And then LeBron's like, you can't go to E3 camp.

2867
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,920
And then he's like, no, but dad, I want to.

2868
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,479
And then the movie, it spoilers.

2869
02:05:16,479 --> 02:05:16,800
It ends.

2870
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,659
The kid goes to E3 camp.

2871
02:05:18,659 --> 02:05:19,619
Oh, all right.

2872
02:05:19,619 --> 02:05:22,960
The whole time I'm watching, I'm like, E3 is not a camp.

2873
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,079
E3 camp.

2874
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,479
But it's literally the logo for E3.

2875
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:27,520
Like they had the rights.

2876
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:28,479
I don't know where it came from.

2877
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:30,899
I'm like, it's not a camp.

2878
02:05:30,899 --> 02:05:32,340
That's so, that's strange.

2879
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:40,279
That's odd.

2880
02:05:40,279 --> 02:05:43,699
And then it's like, they're all in a video game.

2881
02:05:43,699 --> 02:05:44,819
It's like the idea.

2882
02:05:44,819 --> 02:05:48,159
Like, oh, LeBron, you got sucked into the video game.

2883
02:05:48,159 --> 02:05:52,399
But then the video game is just like Don Cheadle's like AI imagination.

2884
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:54,840
I feel like you're just making stuff up.

2885
02:05:56,359 --> 02:05:57,159
I'm literally not.

2886
02:05:57,159 --> 02:05:58,600
I mean, you can ask Chad.

2887
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,880
I'm telling the truth.

2888
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:04,069
And then, but like, it's like the metaverse.

2889
02:06:04,069 --> 02:06:06,069
I think it's the idea, but it's the metaverse.

2890
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:08,949
If it was only Warner Bros characters that they own.

2891
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:13,699
And so they jump like the entire first 40 minutes of the movie

2892
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:15,859
is then just jumping between different properties

2893
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:18,020
that like they are just Bugs Bunny and LeBron.

2894
02:06:18,819 --> 02:06:20,500
Like, they're like, oh, we're in Game of Thrones.

2895
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:20,819
What?

2896
02:06:20,819 --> 02:06:21,699
And it's like, what?

2897
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:22,420
DC?

2898
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:23,220
Where's Batman?

2899
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:25,220
And it's just like, remember all these things?

2900
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:27,000
That's so weird.

2901
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,399
I'm like, wait, where's like Daffy Duck?

2902
02:06:29,399 --> 02:06:30,680
Like, where is everybody?

2903
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:41,430
So wait, how many minutes is Daffy Duck in the movie for?

2904
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:44,020
He might have like three lives.

2905
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:44,659
What?

2906
02:06:44,739 --> 02:06:45,890
Oh, I'm not even kidding.

2907
02:06:46,449 --> 02:06:47,329
You got to be shitting me.

2908
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,619
Oh, my God.

2909
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:56,819
I just got stuffed.

2910
02:06:56,819 --> 02:06:57,619
I got stuffed on.

2911
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:04,210
I sort of went way quicker than that.

2912
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:04,770
That was dumb.

2913
02:07:05,489 --> 02:07:12,960
Sure played more LeBron earlier.

2914
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,319
I forgot I'm good with him.

2915
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:21,250
There it goes.

2916
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:25,270
I thought they were going to drop down more.

2917
02:07:32,899 --> 02:07:33,619
We're good.

2918
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:35,909
I get to watch it and give it.

2919
02:07:35,909 --> 02:07:36,229
Should I?

2920
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,630
Okay.

2921
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:38,630
Should I watch the new movie?

2922
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:41,090
I'd like to hear what you thought.

2923
02:07:41,569 --> 02:07:43,970
You want me to give you like a full review after I see it?

2924
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:46,439
Yeah, I would like to hear it.

2925
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:47,960
I mean, I also like don't want to wish that on you.

2926
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:50,119
I feel like you'd be really upset, but.

2927
02:07:50,119 --> 02:07:50,439
Should I?

2928
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:50,680
Okay.

2929
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,939
Should I be interested?

2930
02:07:51,939 --> 02:07:52,180
All right.

2931
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:52,579
How about this?

2932
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:56,899
I will watch the movie and I will write you like a three or four paragraph

2933
02:07:56,899 --> 02:07:58,500
professional review of the movie.

2934
02:07:58,500 --> 02:07:59,380
Okay.

2935
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,920
And you will you will read it on your stream.

2936
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:02,319
Okay.

2937
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:02,800
I'm done.

2938
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:03,600
You don't do that?

2939
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:04,000
Okay.

2940
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,399
Yeah.

2941
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:08,000
All right.

2942
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,359
Just give me like back in action.

2943
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:10,479
I love that movie as a kid.

2944
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:13,039
I don't think it's very good looking back, but I used to love that.

2945
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:14,550
Just give me six months.

2946
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,789
Okay.

2947
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:20,560
I mean, you got to make sure it's like proofread and those paragraphs are good.

2948
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:23,430
Live tweet your reaction.

2949
02:08:26,149 --> 02:08:29,510
Great if like one of your like five, like four to five of your tweets in the year

2950
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:32,439
are just like throughout Space Jam 2.

2951
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:34,579
I actually think that's kind of funny.

2952
02:08:37,489 --> 02:08:41,619
Half of my tweets for the whole year or more are a live.

2953
02:08:41,619 --> 02:08:44,100
I'll lose thousands of followers, but do I really care?

2954
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,159
If I tweet that much in one day, people are going to remember that they followed me like

2955
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:52,800
eight years ago because they'll see me, right?

2956
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:53,840
Because they never do.

2957
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,979
Because I'm only in people's feeds like once every like three or four months.

2958
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,939
So they will they will see it during the day and be like,

2959
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:00,819
oh, should I follow this guy?

2960
02:09:00,819 --> 02:09:02,100
This guy sucks and unfollow me.

2961
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,930
They're like, wait, who is this guy?

2962
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:05,890
They click the link in your bio.

2963
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:07,810
They're like, yeah, he hasn't uploaded in like eight years.

2964
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:08,310
Yeah.

2965
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:09,489
Yeah.

2966
02:09:09,489 --> 02:09:10,130
That's worth it.

2967
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:11,010
Whatever.

2968
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:18,439
Shut up, you asshole.

2969
02:09:18,439 --> 02:09:19,880
All your tweets get a lot of likes.

2970
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:24,979
No, they don't.

2971
02:09:24,979 --> 02:09:25,479
Do they?

2972
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:31,989
Let me check.

2973
02:09:31,989 --> 02:09:32,550
All right.

2974
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:37,239
Connor, go read, go read out loud the last five.

2975
02:09:37,239 --> 02:09:39,159
That's not that's not the going live one.

2976
02:09:39,159 --> 02:09:41,569
So you have no, not the going live one.

2977
02:09:41,569 --> 02:09:45,489
We have I spent the last 20 minutes going line by line translating this old note

2978
02:09:45,489 --> 02:09:46,529
I had on my iPhone.

2979
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:49,649
It was from a year ago, freaking out, trying to decipher its meaning.

2980
02:09:49,649 --> 02:09:50,449
Was I hacked?

2981
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:52,050
Did I do this in my sleep?

2982
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:53,250
Demon shit?

2983
02:09:53,250 --> 02:09:57,250
No, it's just the default pages template template with lorem ipsum.

2984
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:59,810
I got 60K likes.

2985
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:01,250
What did why?

2986
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:02,609
I don't know.

2987
02:10:02,609 --> 02:10:06,869
Apparently it hit.

2988
02:10:06,869 --> 02:10:13,350
Even your hashtag ad, we got 10K people excited to see if we

2989
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:17,109
we have everybody twerked and everybody gave a drug PSA.

2990
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:17,670
Good luck.

2991
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:18,789
Okay.

2992
02:10:18,789 --> 02:10:20,069
That's for the green screen footage.

2993
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,939
You're probably going to go back a year, by the way.

2994
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:31,380
I'm like looking through trying to see what like isn't like an announcement.

2995
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:37,439
They are nerfed as again, or is he still like amazing?

2996
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:39,680
I think they nerfed him pretty hard before complaining.

2997
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,039
What happened there?

2998
02:10:42,039 --> 02:10:42,920
That was kind of a mess.

2999
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,399
I don't know.

3000
02:10:43,399 --> 02:10:45,159
Honestly, I just couldn't get back.

3001
02:10:45,159 --> 02:10:46,279
I guess I ran out of specials.

3002
02:10:46,279 --> 02:10:48,920
Oh, nice.

3003
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:49,720
Nice try.

3004
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:50,279
Nice try.

3005
02:10:50,279 --> 02:10:50,600
Whatever.

3006
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,520
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?

3007
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,199
Like currently before saying special.

3008
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,199
Stop doing that.

3009
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:10,840
Stop doing that.

3010
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:11,640
Stop doing that to me.

3011
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,079
Okay, we're good.

3012
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:13,479
Stop.

3013
02:11:15,810 --> 02:11:16,850
Oh, my goodness gracious.

3014
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:18,289
We got fucking diarrhea on.

3015
02:11:19,569 --> 02:11:24,210
What is that guy's username?

3016
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:27,479
Readableboy44.

3017
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:32,689
Okay.

3018
02:11:32,689 --> 02:11:39,319
Well, then that guy's name is focus on these.

3019
02:11:39,319 --> 02:11:40,680
We can't lose to these guys.

3020
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:41,800
We just did bad.

3021
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:43,880
We can't lose to them.

3022
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:45,000
We just did very.

3023
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:45,720
All right.

3024
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:45,960
All right.

3025
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:46,439
We're going.

3026
02:11:46,439 --> 02:11:47,000
I got an idea.

3027
02:11:59,319 --> 02:12:02,340
I knew I should have taken that carrot at Albuquerque.

3028
02:12:08,439 --> 02:12:10,199
Double Rindog wins this matchup.

3029
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:18,739
Level 21.

3030
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:23,159
It's not fair.

3031
02:12:23,159 --> 02:12:26,279
They should they should delete your account when you get to level 20 on any character.

3032
02:12:28,609 --> 02:12:30,689
Yeah, like you got to play something else.

3033
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:33,250
It's a free to play game.

3034
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:33,810
Come on now.

3035
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:34,689
Let people have a chance.

3036
02:12:39,909 --> 02:12:42,390
No, did you have a least favorite movie?

3037
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:47,460
It's been a while since I've seen a movie that I genuinely really hated.

3038
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,260
Yeah, I didn't have a least favorite until I saw that.

3039
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:53,619
Honestly, that's become that's become least favorite ever upset me.

3040
02:12:53,619 --> 02:12:55,140
Well, because like even as like a kid, right?

3041
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:57,939
I'd be like, oh, maybe they'll make a new Space Jam movie.

3042
02:12:58,739 --> 02:13:00,180
Like, oh, it'll come out one day.

3043
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:01,300
And then it finally happened.

3044
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:03,939
And then it was like, and you just hate you hated it.

3045
02:13:03,939 --> 02:13:07,300
It was everything I hated about what it possibly could have been.

3046
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:16,520
Oh, how did that not hit?

3047
02:13:17,319 --> 02:13:22,800
What?

3048
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:23,840
Excuse me.

3049
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,119
What the fuck just happened?

3050
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:49,779
Oh, oh, got it.

3051
02:13:49,779 --> 02:13:51,810
Hey, do you guys want a TV?

3052
02:13:56,289 --> 02:13:57,329
Do you guys want a TV, too?

3053
02:13:57,329 --> 02:14:00,210
I mean, wait a second, remove a game for a second.

3054
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:01,970
I thought this was the person that we were playing in the game.

3055
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:03,409
And I was like, is this voice chat?

3056
02:14:05,079 --> 02:14:05,800
They added that.

3057
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:06,600
I'll chat.

3058
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,000
I'll chat.

3059
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:10,850
Oh, we got we got it right there.

3060
02:14:10,850 --> 02:14:11,090
All right.

3061
02:14:11,090 --> 02:14:12,369
That's that's one on one.

3062
02:14:12,369 --> 02:14:13,489
That's one on one.

3063
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:18,069
Do you guys want to play when you're done with this, though?

3064
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:18,550
Or not?

3065
02:14:19,539 --> 02:14:20,579
Yeah, we'll play a game, too.

3066
02:14:20,579 --> 02:14:22,020
Yeah, I'm done.

3067
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:22,520
Okay.

3068
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:25,000
I'll add you guys.

3069
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,359
Did you put your info?

3070
02:14:26,359 --> 02:14:27,720
Yeah, it's in there somewhere, I think.

3071
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,439
Yeah, I have mine.

3072
02:14:28,439 --> 02:14:30,210
Do you both request?

3073
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:30,850
Sick.

3074
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:31,250
Thank you.

3075
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:33,090
Mine's not really in there.

3076
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:34,449
It's I forgot the numbers.

3077
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,529
Yeah, it's like Scarlett something.

3078
02:14:41,159 --> 02:14:43,560
Look, it's focused on these join the voice chat.

3079
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:45,079
Yeah, it did.

3080
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,399
I don't know.

3081
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:51,279
I don't know my username.

3082
02:15:05,039 --> 02:15:06,079
And your username?

3083
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:06,579
Why?

3084
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:08,479
I don't want to be German 985.

3085
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:13,840
Someone probably already is German 985.

3086
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:14,479
Yeah, guys.

3087
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:17,680
I'm sure it's probably been taken like 5,000 different versions of the name.

3088
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,920
Why not?

3089
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:28,789
Because back in the TF2 days, this is a real story.

3090
02:15:28,789 --> 02:15:32,949
Back in the TF2 days, if I was if you were like making YouTube videos

3091
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:36,689
or whatever, if you were streaming, whatever, not not back then.

3092
02:15:36,689 --> 02:15:41,890
But if your name was like German 985 and it was like confirmed that that's you,

3093
02:15:42,529 --> 02:15:45,649
it'd be 30 people lining up to high five you and the game would be ruined.

3094
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,920
I'm trying to take myself out of the equation.

3095
02:15:49,479 --> 02:15:50,199
It's not me.

3096
02:15:50,199 --> 02:15:51,560
This is just a person playing the game.

3097
02:15:52,199 --> 02:15:55,300
So I always just ever since I did it like that.

3098
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:59,520
That's what I when people recognize me in a game, I'm just like,

3099
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:00,560
oh my God, is that Connor?

3100
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,760
I'm like, no, I'm just a fan.

3101
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:12,439
That's why I used to my names used to be like car dealership,

3102
02:16:12,439 --> 02:16:13,880
like 200 or something.

3103
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:15,319
And people just be like, who the fuck is this guy?

3104
02:16:15,319 --> 02:16:15,960
200.

3105
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,560
Yeah, I've played with that guy.

3106
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:18,840
Yeah, he was pretty good.

3107
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:24,470
Watch that hit.

3108
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,430
Oh, my God.

3109
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:26,470
That was disgusting.

3110
02:16:27,029 --> 02:16:28,390
Oh, my goodness gracious.

3111
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:30,710
That was a that was a delicious combo.

3112
02:16:30,710 --> 02:16:31,909
That was ridiculous.

3113
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:49,649
All right.

3114
02:16:49,649 --> 02:16:50,690
They're going to try to run back here.

3115
02:16:50,690 --> 02:16:51,010
Careful.

3116
02:17:08,579 --> 02:17:09,219
Good, good, good.

3117
02:17:12,069 --> 02:17:14,469
Oh, he almost finished that Superman.

3118
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:32,159
There he goes.

3119
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:38,049
Oh, he grabbed me from behind.

3120
02:17:38,850 --> 02:17:39,969
There it goes.

3121
02:17:39,969 --> 02:17:40,290
All right.

3122
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:40,770
Here we go.

3123
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:45,200
Good fight.

3124
02:17:46,709 --> 02:17:47,270
Good fight.

3125
02:17:47,989 --> 02:17:48,629
That two one.

3126
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:49,760
That is it.

3127
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:50,159
Yeah.

3128
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:52,000
You fucked up, boy.

3129
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,280
Yeah, we kicked their ass.

3130
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:55,000
Good to hear.

3131
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,520
I sent you both friend requests so we can add you.

3132
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,680
Uh, German, I think you're the host.

3133
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:01,239
Oh, yeah.

3134
02:18:01,879 --> 02:18:03,909
I added it.

3135
02:18:03,909 --> 02:18:04,709
Dr. Battle.

3136
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:05,920
Yep.

3137
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:13,639
Oh, wait, we're not doing a we're just inviting everybody to a party.

3138
02:18:13,639 --> 02:18:14,120
Can you do that?

3139
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:15,639
Or are we doing custom game?

3140
02:18:15,639 --> 02:18:17,639
I was just going to do it the way I didn't turn custom.

3141
02:18:17,639 --> 02:18:17,959
Yeah.

3142
02:18:17,959 --> 02:18:18,280
Oh, OK.

3143
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:18,520
Yeah.

3144
02:18:19,239 --> 02:18:21,239
I've got the custom set up.

3145
02:18:21,239 --> 02:18:21,719
Oh, yeah.

3146
02:18:21,719 --> 02:18:21,959
Yeah.

3147
02:18:24,049 --> 02:18:25,239
Are we friends?

3148
02:18:25,239 --> 02:18:26,680
Because I have that Dr. Battle, right?

3149
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,120
Gave me error except.

3150
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:30,520
Yeah, I got you.

3151
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,360
Oh, I got Scarlet Otter.

3152
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,959
OK, sending an invite there.

3153
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:35,879
Uh, German, you may not have to invite me.

3154
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:37,959
And then you could invite him and I'm going to invite you.

3155
02:18:37,959 --> 02:18:39,079
Yeah, I'll pull them.

3156
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:47,159
Is there a bracket or a mainstream for this tournament anywhere?

3157
02:18:47,719 --> 02:18:50,520
The guy's on YouTube and not on this site.

3158
02:18:53,270 --> 02:19:04,659
And then I'll pull you now.

3159
02:19:04,659 --> 02:19:07,440
Very cool.

3160
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:09,280
So yeah, who's did they finish?

3161
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,399
Who's who's?

3162
02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:13,120
No, they're they're in like losers finals right now, I think.

3163
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,319
Or maybe they're starting grands.

3164
02:19:14,319 --> 02:19:15,280
I don't remember.

3165
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:20,100
Who's who's one and two or who's like the top four right now?

3166
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:22,420
It's Stans and Alpharad.

3167
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:26,180
I think they're in game three and they're in game three.

3168
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:29,620
And then it's Jesse and Slick waiting and winners of grands.

3169
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:31,459
And me and Sheep got fourth place.

3170
02:19:31,459 --> 02:19:35,540
Yeah, we had the worst seating.

3171
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:35,860
Yeah.

3172
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:36,020
Yeah.

3173
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:39,239
Would you guys start off against Slick?

3174
02:19:39,239 --> 02:19:39,799
Oh, yeah.

3175
02:19:39,799 --> 02:19:41,000
Yeah, they were in the same.

3176
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,879
They're very good.

3177
02:19:41,879 --> 02:19:44,200
That was the only one because we lost to Stans as well.

3178
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:48,719
But I felt like those were close, but Jesse and Slick.

3179
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:49,680
Fucked us up.

3180
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:53,780
Yeah, we we were pretty close on the second game with them.

3181
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:55,680
Yeah.

3182
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:56,799
Here comes the heat.

3183
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:11,889
You know, please don't play on the Steven Universe stage again.

3184
02:20:11,889 --> 02:20:13,350
Well, we can't we can't.

3185
02:20:14,149 --> 02:20:16,149
Well, everybody hates the Steven Universe.

3186
02:20:17,569 --> 02:20:19,239
The Rick and Morty stage.

3187
02:20:19,239 --> 02:20:21,959
Actually, can we adjust the map pool in a custom?

3188
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:22,440
I think so.

3189
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,760
You can pick a specific one, but can you just like take one out?

3190
02:20:25,479 --> 02:20:26,680
Yeah, you can take one out.

3191
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:27,959
I don't know how you pick a specific one.

3192
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:31,829
I don't either.

3193
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:34,790
Oh, shit, I got to pick a character.

3194
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:40,549
Why aren't my my perks aren't like unlocked?

3195
02:20:40,549 --> 02:20:42,479
That was weird.

3196
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:43,040
I just played.

3197
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:44,000
I just picked a bunch of perks.

3198
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:44,479
I don't know.

3199
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,110
Well, we haven't locked in yet.

3200
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:48,229
Oh, I enjoy.

3201
02:20:48,229 --> 02:20:50,229
Oh, that's why I was like, what?

3202
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:51,750
Look who it is.

3203
02:20:52,389 --> 02:20:54,159
Oh, yeah.

3204
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:56,159
Those guys, one of them had an iron giant, right?

3205
02:20:57,319 --> 02:21:00,600
I heard they were reducing iron giant size by like 70 percent.

3206
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:03,159
He's going to be shorter than like Bugs Bunny in the next patch.

3207
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:05,159
They heard a lot of times.

3208
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:06,579
I know.

3209
02:21:06,579 --> 02:21:07,219
Iron guy.

3210
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:18,319
Iron gentleman.

3211
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:19,360
It's that orchestra one.

3212
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:23,459
Please, we can't hear it anymore.

3213
02:21:23,459 --> 02:21:25,780
We'll turn the sound off and put on

3214
02:21:27,319 --> 02:21:29,079
put on like your favorite podcast.

3215
02:21:29,079 --> 02:21:36,629
The Stains show, which needs a new episode.

3216
02:21:36,629 --> 02:21:37,989
We've been working on it.

3217
02:21:37,989 --> 02:21:40,290
I'm going to laugh if we're just on that stage.

3218
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:41,860
The person is going to leave.

3219
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:43,700
It's Rick and Morty.

3220
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,600
Oh, yeah, it's Rick and Morty.

3221
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,639
Rick and Morty.

3222
02:21:47,639 --> 02:21:52,680
Let's do it.

3223
02:22:13,799 --> 02:22:14,299
Freeze.

3224
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:20,500
It's true.

3225
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:21,940
You cannot guard LeBron.

3226
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:23,940
Oh, he's six foot eight.

3227
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,500
He's the goat.

3228
02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:28,399
Oh, so you can hit him with the car.

3229
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:38,500
You're into that shit.

3230
02:22:39,139 --> 02:22:41,559
I should have gone LeBron against iron giant.

3231
02:22:41,559 --> 02:22:43,409
I feel like he fucks him up.

3232
02:22:43,969 --> 02:22:45,090
You are LeBron.

3233
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:45,719
I know.

3234
02:22:45,719 --> 02:22:47,000
But when we fought slick.

3235
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:58,129
Oh, I was like, I was like, oh, no, that was supposed to be a punch.

3236
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:07,030
Oh, oh, very cool.

3237
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,530
Superman.

3238
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:13,159
Oh, my God.

3239
02:23:13,159 --> 02:23:13,959
How am I still on stage?

3240
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:17,250
I don't know.

3241
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:19,170
Oh, that was close.

3242
02:23:22,209 --> 02:23:24,049
What did you bounce off something?

3243
02:23:24,049 --> 02:23:24,690
I don't know.

3244
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:25,649
I like bounced back.

3245
02:23:26,530 --> 02:23:30,559
I feel like that happened to me a couple of times in the tournament, to be honest.

3246
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:32,399
There I go.

3247
02:23:32,399 --> 02:23:38,309
I don't pay to lose or to die.

3248
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:39,450
Oh, no.

3249
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:41,879
Get out of here, LeBron.

3250
02:23:41,879 --> 02:23:49,569
Oh, I'm in gun mode.

3251
02:23:50,370 --> 02:23:51,090
You're not a gun.

3252
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,639
I feel like the gun mode is working.

3253
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:55,159
I'm in it, too.

3254
02:23:55,879 --> 02:23:56,379
Shooting.

3255
02:23:57,079 --> 02:23:58,440
They don't know what to do.

3256
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:01,290
Damn.

3257
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:05,219
You guys are sticking around.

3258
02:24:06,819 --> 02:24:11,159
That ain't good.

3259
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:12,280
We're all right.

3260
02:24:13,479 --> 02:24:17,590
You're like another hunter on me and I'll be done.

3261
02:24:20,799 --> 02:24:21,280
Oh, my goodness.

3262
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,000
I thought you flew off.

3263
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:28,200
How the hell are you not dead?

3264
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:29,559
Iron giant.

3265
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:31,959
It's OK to die.

3266
02:24:31,959 --> 02:24:32,840
It's not OK to kill.

3267
02:24:33,719 --> 02:24:37,840
Boy, the Superman.

3268
02:24:41,969 --> 02:24:43,280
Damn it.

3269
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:44,399
That was supposed to be a punch.

3270
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:44,899
Grab me.

3271
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:51,500
Oh, no.

3272
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,350
Oh, goodbye.

3273
02:24:59,350 --> 02:24:59,850
Whoa.

3274
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:01,909
That was sick.

3275
02:25:01,909 --> 02:25:02,409
That was sick.

3276
02:25:02,409 --> 02:25:03,110
I almost brought it back.

3277
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:03,610
I tried.

3278
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:04,389
That was really close.

3279
02:25:04,389 --> 02:25:06,709
Superman's tough to finish.

3280
02:25:06,709 --> 02:25:07,209
Yeah.

3281
02:25:07,209 --> 02:25:08,389
He's so annoying.

3282
02:25:08,389 --> 02:25:09,030
He's tricky.

3283
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:12,280
I feel like the iron giant's got that, too.

3284
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:14,920
Like, you got to follow up on him to kill him

3285
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:17,159
because it's going to be hard to kill him just from the stage.

3286
02:25:17,159 --> 02:25:19,159
Yeah, you got to like bounce, bounce, bounce.

3287
02:25:19,159 --> 02:25:19,719
Just follow him up.

3288
02:25:19,719 --> 02:25:20,840
Especially when you start flying.

3289
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,120
It's just like just going to the feet.

3290
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:24,420
Just trying to knock him a little higher.

3291
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:25,299
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3292
02:25:25,299 --> 02:25:26,340
He's huge.

3293
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:27,540
Stop eating raw pork.

3294
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:28,819
I've been eating carrots.

3295
02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:30,180
What are people talking about?

3296
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:31,680
Real carrots or baby carrots?

3297
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,200
Raw pork is very dangerous.

3298
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,760
Just the carrots that are like a big pencil.

3299
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:37,040
You know what I mean?

3300
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:37,360
OK.

3301
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:43,280
Yeah, it's audible.

3302
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,639
It's very clear.

3303
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,159
Any doctors here?

3304
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:48,799
If I eat carrots for four hours, is that bad?

3305
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:50,959
I've been eating carrots for two straight hours.

3306
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:51,840
No, that's fine.

3307
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,280
You probably can't OD on carrots.

3308
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:57,200
I think if you ate carrots for four hours straight every day,

3309
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:00,159
then eventually you're going to start shitting weird or something.

3310
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:01,600
But I don't think you're going to be in danger.

3311
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:09,889
God.

3312
02:26:09,889 --> 02:26:11,889
You can turn orange if you eat too many carrots.

3313
02:26:11,889 --> 02:26:14,469
That sounds like a lie.

3314
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:15,110
How do I look?

3315
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:23,299
It's double LeBron.

3316
02:26:23,299 --> 02:26:24,260
Oh, no.

3317
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:25,639
Yeah, we'll be in weirdos.

3318
02:26:25,639 --> 02:26:27,399
There's going to be so many basketballs.

3319
02:26:27,399 --> 02:26:27,899
I know.

3320
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:29,420
Two, I guess.

3321
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:32,780
But I think you can have four active though, can't he?

3322
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:34,059
Like two, I mean, two at a time.

3323
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:35,190
Yep.

3324
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:37,030
Can you have one that's like free falling

3325
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,870
and then he can still do basketball moves?

3326
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:40,790
Yeah, if you bounce one, his down special.

3327
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:44,620
OK, I said I turned orange eating too many carrots

3328
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:46,219
one time at the hospital.

3329
02:26:46,219 --> 02:26:46,719
What?

3330
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:48,540
That's what that guy said.

3331
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:49,260
I don't say that.

3332
02:26:50,139 --> 02:26:51,129
Watch out.

3333
02:26:51,930 --> 02:27:17,940
Wrong way.

3334
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:22,780
Jesus, I'm getting dunked on by the all-time scoring leader.

3335
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:23,280
Yep.

3336
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:31,850
It might be a double LeBron team, Jeremy.

3337
02:27:31,850 --> 02:27:32,569
This might be us.

3338
02:27:33,129 --> 02:27:34,649
We've been playing well with the double LeBron.

3339
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,600
Oh, I'm trying to play around here.

3340
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,159
That was close.

3341
02:28:04,809 --> 02:28:05,290
Oh, my God.

3342
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:06,809
We're going crazy.

3343
02:28:08,329 --> 02:28:09,049
Bounce, bounce.

3344
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:12,889
I don't think teams should be allowed to have

3345
02:28:12,889 --> 02:28:14,969
eight finals wins combined.

3346
02:28:20,739 --> 02:28:22,420
That was lucky that I stayed alive.

3347
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:33,690
Give me that ball.

3348
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:58,709
Oh, my goodness.

3349
02:29:05,909 --> 02:29:07,030
Oh, I thought I hit him.

3350
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:07,829
Oh, it's all right.

3351
02:29:07,829 --> 02:29:08,329
Good.

3352
02:29:10,659 --> 02:29:13,459
Yeah, that was that was.

3353
02:29:13,459 --> 02:29:15,700
Oh, we're saying I thought we do you end of the game

3354
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:17,059
when you've got Connor.

3355
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:18,979
I thought we knew when we won.

3356
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,920
Look at how happy LeBron's are.

3357
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:27,399
How come they couldn't get LeBron to do the voice lines?

3358
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:29,399
We were talking about that earlier.

3359
02:29:29,399 --> 02:29:30,920
He doesn't know he's in the game.

3360
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:32,520
I heard that they're working on that, though.

3361
02:29:33,719 --> 02:29:35,479
I watched a video that talked about this game

3362
02:29:35,479 --> 02:29:37,719
and they said that LeBron was going to do the voice lines.

3363
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,680
Either they're misinformed or they're not.

3364
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:43,000
I guess it has to be one of them, right?

3365
02:29:43,799 --> 02:29:46,170
All right, let's change it up.

3366
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:46,649
What do I want to do?

3367
02:29:46,649 --> 02:29:49,049
People just like lie for no reason sometimes.

3368
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,479
Yeah, it's true.

3369
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:59,540
Kind of insta locked LeBron.

3370
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:00,340
I should have changed it.

3371
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:04,180
Jerma, your eyes are turning orange.

3372
02:30:04,819 --> 02:30:08,760
Yeah, a lot of people have been saying that.

3373
02:30:09,399 --> 02:30:11,829
LeBron's really fun to play.

3374
02:30:14,069 --> 02:30:14,709
Yeah, he's great.

3375
02:30:19,579 --> 02:30:22,280
Play Bugs Bunny, you carrot eater.

3376
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,719
I think I played bugs all day.

3377
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:27,129
What we got?

3378
02:30:27,129 --> 02:30:35,000
So how do you guys like the game?

3379
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,360
I think it's fine.

3380
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:38,680
I don't I play melee mostly, so I don't know

3381
02:30:39,239 --> 02:30:40,840
how much I'm going to not play melee for this,

3382
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:42,840
but I'm having fun being there and giant.

3383
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,600
Yeah, I like it.

3384
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:48,379
I don't know how much competitive legs it has, but it's fun.

3385
02:30:53,430 --> 02:30:55,590
You were playing a lot during the first day, right?

3386
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:57,030
Or do you think I saw?

3387
02:30:57,030 --> 02:31:00,389
He yeah, I played a decent during their first video.

3388
02:31:00,389 --> 02:31:01,510
I played it off stream a lot, too.

3389
02:31:06,709 --> 02:31:07,430
I really like it.

3390
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:09,559
I found it.

3391
02:31:09,559 --> 02:31:10,360
Yeah, it's fun.

3392
02:31:12,379 --> 02:31:13,659
I like just the netcode alone.

3393
02:31:13,659 --> 02:31:14,780
It's like enough for me to want to play it.

3394
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:15,739
Yeah.

3395
02:31:20,709 --> 02:31:24,309
Amazing how like Nintendo still doesn't have like an online system.

3396
02:31:26,569 --> 02:31:31,500
I mean, the idea is if, you know,

3397
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:34,139
if Warner Brothers is going to support this and really care about it,

3398
02:31:34,139 --> 02:31:35,659
then oh, yeah, hope they do.

3399
02:31:35,659 --> 02:31:35,899
Yeah.

3400
02:31:36,620 --> 02:31:41,180
Did you see that information about how much people like Evo is this last weekend

3401
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:44,860
and like fifth place for multiverses, which was a side game,

3402
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:47,500
got more than like first place for some of the main games?

3403
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:47,899
Really?

3404
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:48,860
Yeah.

3405
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:50,540
Like, holy shit.

3406
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:53,180
I think 17th place for multiverses.

3407
02:31:53,180 --> 02:31:57,420
Again, a side game got more than like fifth place for some games or something.

3408
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:00,139
There was a practical task tweet about it.

3409
02:32:00,139 --> 02:32:01,420
I can't remember all the details,

3410
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:04,219
but Warner Brothers put a lot of money into this game.

3411
02:32:04,219 --> 02:32:05,739
They should do something for this tournament.

3412
02:32:07,739 --> 02:32:08,299
That'd be cool.

3413
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:12,969
I think maybe four, even fifth.

3414
02:32:12,969 --> 02:32:13,450
I don't know.

3415
02:32:14,649 --> 02:32:15,930
Tied for fifth place should have seen,

3416
02:32:15,930 --> 02:32:18,649
you know, seven hundred thousand dollars or something like that.

3417
02:32:18,649 --> 02:32:19,129
Yeah.

3418
02:32:19,129 --> 02:32:24,090
I take which means fourth place is probably one point two at that point, right?

3419
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:27,049
Yeah, that'd be like one point three.

3420
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:28,889
Yeah, maybe.

3421
02:32:28,889 --> 02:32:29,690
Say that makes sense.

3422
02:32:31,049 --> 02:32:34,409
I'll take like two bucks or something at this point.

3423
02:32:40,459 --> 02:32:41,340
That was crazy.

3424
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,260
Did you just run out of resources?

3425
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,579
Yeah, I just was hoping I caught somebody in it.

3426
02:32:45,579 --> 02:32:46,780
Ran out of basketballs.

3427
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:50,360
I mean, I feel like you guys just went easy on us

3428
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:51,879
because you didn't go double LeBron again.

3429
02:32:54,659 --> 02:32:57,219
My Taz was not was not very good that round.

3430
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:04,469
Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know, like a 50 to 100 million dollar tournament.

3431
02:33:04,469 --> 02:33:07,030
You know, the first hundred places get, you know,

3432
02:33:07,030 --> 02:33:11,059
place 100 gets like two hundred thousand something like that.

3433
02:33:11,059 --> 02:33:15,139
And it's just people that Ludwig knows off the top of his head and in the tournament,

3434
02:33:15,139 --> 02:33:17,059
not like top players only or anything.

3435
02:33:17,059 --> 02:33:20,180
Just, you know, what's the biggest?

3436
02:33:20,180 --> 02:33:21,620
What's the biggest prize pool ever?

3437
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:24,139
Is it that Dota tournament?

3438
02:33:24,139 --> 02:33:25,020
Oh, like ever, ever.

3439
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:26,540
But it's not a lot of big ones.

3440
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:29,989
Don't just have like 10 to 20 million, right?

3441
02:33:29,989 --> 02:33:33,670
I I want to say it's got to be Dota, but I'm not 100% sure.

3442
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:39,290
I know that I know CS has had some really big prize pools,

3443
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:40,489
but I don't know if they can.

3444
02:33:40,489 --> 02:33:43,770
Yeah, your Dota two had a forty seven million.

3445
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:44,329
Wow.

3446
02:33:45,530 --> 02:33:46,010
Wow.

3447
02:33:46,010 --> 02:33:47,209
I was saying that as a joke.

3448
02:33:47,209 --> 02:33:48,170
That actually happened.

3449
02:33:48,889 --> 02:33:52,680
How many people get a million?

3450
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:54,920
Like, is that just the winning team or is it like the top?

3451
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:55,959
It's a prize pool.

3452
02:33:55,959 --> 02:33:57,239
So I imagine it was spread.

3453
02:33:57,319 --> 02:33:58,680
That's probably probably spread.

3454
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:01,879
That's like winning the mega millions jackpot.

3455
02:34:01,879 --> 02:34:03,719
That's like the type of crazy number.

3456
02:34:03,719 --> 02:34:07,079
That's like life changing in a way that is changing

3457
02:34:07,079 --> 02:34:10,760
like the future generations of your life of your family's way, too.

3458
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:12,440
That's going to be like a money laundering.

3459
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,780
Eighteen million over 18 million went to team one.

3460
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:16,739
There's no way.

3461
02:34:16,739 --> 02:34:17,780
How much was team two?

3462
02:34:18,979 --> 02:34:22,329
Because team two got like nine million.

3463
02:34:22,329 --> 02:34:25,610
Can you imagine playing a game of Dota for nine million dollars?

3464
02:34:26,569 --> 02:34:28,010
I would I would shit my pants.

3465
02:34:28,969 --> 02:34:31,129
I better hit you at the right time.

3466
02:34:31,129 --> 02:34:33,690
Otherwise, I might lose nine million dollars.

3467
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:35,770
I probably would fucking puke, right?

3468
02:34:35,770 --> 02:34:41,129
Like it's so much like nerves like, geez, like 10 million, 20 million dollars.

3469
02:34:41,129 --> 02:34:44,329
But at the same time, you've already won nine million.

3470
02:34:44,329 --> 02:34:45,450
So maybe the nerves go away.

3471
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:46,329
You're like, I'm already sad.

3472
02:34:46,329 --> 02:34:50,969
This is just extra difference between nine and 18 million dollars.

3473
02:34:50,969 --> 02:34:54,420
Really true.

3474
02:34:55,219 --> 02:35:00,889
Hey, what's the best liberon that I can just use?

3475
02:35:01,610 --> 02:35:04,569
Uh, his side special is like almost instant kill

3476
02:35:04,569 --> 02:35:07,770
if they have at least 50 to 60 damage or at least like 70.

3477
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:11,129
Don't it has no priority, though, so you really have to land it.

3478
02:35:15,829 --> 02:35:16,469
Whoo.

3479
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:17,190
Don't don't.

3480
02:35:20,809 --> 02:35:21,129
Damn.

3481
02:35:21,129 --> 02:35:22,250
You hit me like seven times.

3482
02:35:24,329 --> 02:35:28,250
That's what I kept missing in the tournament is the Superman is a Superman.

3483
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:40,729
What the hell?

3484
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:48,149
Oh, I enjoyed it.

3485
02:35:50,579 --> 02:35:51,540
Did I hit you with that bat?

3486
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:52,180
That was crazy.

3487
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:53,299
You were like far away.

3488
02:35:55,670 --> 02:35:58,500
Oh, oh, my God.

3489
02:35:58,500 --> 02:35:59,219
That I'm alive.

3490
02:35:59,219 --> 02:35:59,700
I'm alive.

3491
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:02,489
Oh, my God.

3492
02:36:03,049 --> 02:36:06,569
I've never seen someone with faster knockback than in that move right there.

3493
02:36:06,569 --> 02:36:08,329
It's so I got deleted.

3494
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,659
Oh, I'm living.

3495
02:36:28,170 --> 02:36:31,209
Oh, I was I was out there to try to kill you in case he didn't.

3496
02:36:32,889 --> 02:36:34,700
Oh, I'm dead.

3497
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:35,020
I'm dead.

3498
02:36:37,479 --> 02:36:47,270
Oh, so close.

3499
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:56,040
131.

3500
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:56,920
Oh, my goodness.

3501
02:36:58,600 --> 02:36:59,559
Oh, my God.

3502
02:36:59,559 --> 02:37:01,479
How did you through the floor?

3503
02:37:01,479 --> 02:37:03,719
Oh, that was unbelievable.

3504
02:37:03,719 --> 02:37:05,159
Did you go in the floor?

3505
02:37:05,159 --> 02:37:08,120
I did the dunk and he was jumping up through the floor.

3506
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:08,620
Wow.

3507
02:37:09,319 --> 02:37:11,399
As it happened, that was insane.

3508
02:37:11,399 --> 02:37:12,040
I came.

3509
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,959
Yeah, I came up through the tunnel.

3510
02:37:13,959 --> 02:37:15,700
All I do is get kills.

3511
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:16,819
Was it no damage?

3512
02:37:17,379 --> 02:37:18,340
Hey, that's what you need.

3513
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:19,059
You need someone.

3514
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:22,100
You need someone to hold the line or need someone to throw the ball.

3515
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:25,139
You know, like that was crazy.

3516
02:37:25,139 --> 02:37:25,639
It comes.

3517
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:28,079
Somebody win this tournament yet.

3518
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:28,579
What happened?

3519
02:37:30,239 --> 02:37:31,680
It's probably wrapping up.

3520
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:32,719
I'm not totally sure.

3521
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:36,040
Now, we're going to take it back up tomorrow.

3522
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:41,389
I guess they got to review Ludwig and Alpharet together.

3523
02:37:41,389 --> 02:37:42,030
Wait, really?

3524
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:44,030
I think Stan's at the dip.

3525
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:44,590
Oh, OK.

3526
02:37:44,590 --> 02:37:46,670
Yeah, Stan said he had to leave at 425.

3527
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:47,639
That would be it.

3528
02:37:47,639 --> 02:37:49,959
So I'm guessing that they made it to Grands and then playing.

3529
02:37:49,959 --> 02:37:50,760
Oh, shit.

3530
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:54,200
Yeah, I'll take his money.

3531
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:58,940
Wouldn't mind.

3532
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:00,780
He only deserves second place money.

3533
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:02,860
Even if they win, he doesn't deserve the first place money.

3534
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:08,059
The amount difference between second and first should go, I don't know, maybe to fourth,

3535
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:09,340
I guess.

3536
02:38:09,340 --> 02:38:09,739
Right.

3537
02:38:09,739 --> 02:38:10,940
Just go to fourth.

3538
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:12,299
I'll split it with Tide Fifth either.

3539
02:38:12,299 --> 02:38:17,049
I mean, it should probably play should see at least, you know, 100, 200.

3540
02:38:17,049 --> 02:38:17,450
Maybe.

3541
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:18,170
Yeah, that's what we were saying.

3542
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:20,090
We were saying 100, 100 bucks for fourth.

3543
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:21,530
Ludwig was pretending to not read it.

3544
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:27,579
Oh, Steven Universe, that person's fucking gone.

3545
02:38:29,979 --> 02:38:39,399
Oh, if I really don't so hard, the ball disappears.

3546
02:38:41,319 --> 02:38:43,239
Oh, crazy.

3547
02:38:43,239 --> 02:38:44,440
It's like that in real life, too.

3548
02:38:45,159 --> 02:38:47,799
They have to bring like 20 balls to the game.

3549
02:38:49,319 --> 02:38:51,000
Actually, there probably is 20 balls in the game.

3550
02:38:53,069 --> 02:38:55,870
Do they go through basketballs like baseball goes through baseballs?

3551
02:38:55,870 --> 02:38:56,190
I think so.

3552
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:58,510
Or do they use the same ball the whole game?

3553
02:38:58,510 --> 02:38:58,829
I don't.

3554
02:38:58,829 --> 02:39:00,110
That's a great question.

3555
02:39:00,110 --> 02:39:01,629
That's a really good question.

3556
02:39:01,629 --> 02:39:02,510
I feel like no way.

3557
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:05,309
I feel like basketball probably goes through eight balls for no reason.

3558
02:39:11,229 --> 02:39:12,750
Every dunk, they switch it up.

3559
02:39:13,469 --> 02:39:15,500
No football.

3560
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:17,180
They switch the ball all the time.

3561
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:17,579
They do.

3562
02:39:17,579 --> 02:39:19,420
Well, teams get their own balls, too.

3563
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:20,700
They bring their own balls to the game.

3564
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:21,340
Yeah.

3565
02:39:21,340 --> 02:39:23,979
Because some pitch, like some quarterbacks like the ball to be

3566
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:26,620
inflated, really worn out.

3567
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:26,860
Yeah.

3568
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:28,059
Really worn out and some like.

3569
02:39:28,059 --> 02:39:31,180
Oh, yeah, they do that in the Super Bowl.

3570
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:46,329
I need to kill Jerma.

3571
02:39:46,969 --> 02:39:47,209
Yeah.

3572
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:48,809
Yeah.

3573
02:39:48,809 --> 02:39:49,209
What's up?

3574
02:39:50,649 --> 02:39:52,809
Oh, I thought you said I need to tell Jerma.

3575
02:39:52,809 --> 02:39:54,010
Like, I need to tell you something.

3576
02:39:54,010 --> 02:39:55,290
No, he needs to kill you.

3577
02:39:55,290 --> 02:39:56,010
I need to be honest.

3578
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:59,530
Everything you've known about me has been a fraud.

3579
02:40:01,129 --> 02:40:01,770
My whole life.

3580
02:40:03,690 --> 02:40:04,170
What are you doing?

3581
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:04,729
I lost the ball.

3582
02:40:04,729 --> 02:40:05,290
I was chasing it.

3583
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:06,329
Couldn't get it.

3584
02:40:06,329 --> 02:40:08,010
Doesn't this come back to you?

3585
02:40:08,010 --> 02:40:12,809
I feel like using is a cool thing, which is fine.

3586
02:40:13,530 --> 02:40:15,120
I'm not upset about it.

3587
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,719
LeBron throws the ball to Rhyndag.

3588
02:40:16,719 --> 02:40:17,600
He should say fetch.

3589
02:40:23,129 --> 02:40:24,090
Oh, my goodness.

3590
02:40:24,969 --> 02:40:26,909
You're very high there, Jerma.

3591
02:40:26,989 --> 02:40:28,350
And not just on carrots.

3592
02:40:29,469 --> 02:40:30,590
Getting high on carrots.

3593
02:40:31,709 --> 02:40:33,389
Yeah, I've been like smoking these off here.

3594
02:40:37,629 --> 02:40:40,329
We got to get some kills here.

3595
02:40:40,329 --> 02:40:40,809
I'm going to say.

3596
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:43,129
Jerma's already dead.

3597
02:40:45,719 --> 02:40:48,680
But I'm also very happy.

3598
02:40:53,930 --> 02:40:55,209
It was just like homing onto you.

3599
02:41:00,459 --> 02:41:07,850
You're cool.

3600
02:41:07,850 --> 02:41:08,889
Loving this.

3601
02:41:08,889 --> 02:41:09,610
Oh, my goodness.

3602
02:41:10,989 --> 02:41:12,110
Oh, there I go.

3603
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:21,899
Like halfway to kill.

3604
02:41:29,049 --> 02:41:29,770
No, let me go.

3605
02:41:32,569 --> 02:41:33,930
We are very high percent.

3606
02:41:34,569 --> 02:41:36,379
I'm working on it.

3607
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,840
I don't know what happens when we get tied together.

3608
02:41:48,459 --> 02:41:52,620
I think there's like a button that you can press that like leashes him back to you.

3609
02:41:57,260 --> 02:42:00,219
No, I was in the middle of comboing.

3610
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:02,299
Oh, I could have.

3611
02:42:02,299 --> 02:42:04,540
I probably would have dropped it, but I felt like I could have got it.

3612
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:06,940
Hey, game three.

3613
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:07,100
All right.

3614
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:08,459
This one's for all three.

3615
02:42:08,459 --> 02:42:10,700
Game three thousand dollars.

3616
02:42:10,700 --> 02:42:11,500
This one's for all.

3617
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:13,739
You had six hundred damage, dude.

3618
02:42:15,229 --> 02:42:16,750
Rhyndag was just kind of hitting everybody.

3619
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:17,950
Support character, huh?

3620
02:42:18,750 --> 02:42:20,360
Oh, my God.

3621
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:25,790
Yeah, it looks like you turned on the stream by accident.

3622
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:30,250
That's how I feel.

3623
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:32,969
Sometimes I'm like, what does that mean?

3624
02:42:32,969 --> 02:42:34,409
OK, if it's all the marbles.

3625
02:42:34,409 --> 02:42:36,729
It's kind of funny because I know exactly what they mean.

3626
02:42:38,250 --> 02:42:39,530
Like I, I get it.

3627
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:40,250
I know what you mean.

3628
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:42,809
Like you're just chilling playing multiverses, you know.

3629
02:42:42,809 --> 02:42:43,850
Yeah, we're just like chilling.

3630
02:42:44,409 --> 02:42:46,409
Yeah, that's that's a sometimes it's like that.

3631
02:42:46,409 --> 02:42:46,809
Whatever.

3632
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:49,290
That's how streams should feel.

3633
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:50,409
Ever heard of Clint Stevens?

3634
02:42:50,409 --> 02:42:53,850
Ban that person, ban that person for one full 60 seconds.

3635
02:42:54,649 --> 02:43:03,120
Stop enjoying the game.

3636
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:10,780
But I like the game.

3637
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:14,059
That'll teach him.

3638
02:43:14,059 --> 02:43:16,540
Yeah, then VIP them, then ban them again.

3639
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:19,799
And then put them on stream

3640
02:43:19,799 --> 02:43:21,799
and they can say literally whatever they want for 10 seconds

3641
02:43:21,799 --> 02:43:23,559
and then permanently ban them and then VIP them

3642
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:29,680
and then permanently ban them.

3643
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:31,760
You're just tossing them around at this point.

3644
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:53,049
I really want to just like, you know, fuck with them.

3645
02:43:53,049 --> 02:43:54,090
Trunk on carrots.

3646
02:43:58,590 --> 02:43:59,069
All right.

3647
02:43:59,069 --> 02:44:00,350
This is for the marbles, right?

3648
02:44:00,350 --> 02:44:02,909
Yeah, every last marble.

3649
02:44:02,909 --> 02:44:05,319
Oh, I can't believe that.

3650
02:44:20,799 --> 02:44:21,440
Oh, man.

3651
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:38,750
Oh, damn it.

3652
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:39,309
Oh, my God.

3653
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:44,270
Holy.

3654
02:44:44,270 --> 02:44:45,309
Oh, that killed.

3655
02:44:45,309 --> 02:44:45,709
I did not.

3656
02:44:45,709 --> 02:44:46,670
Holy.

3657
02:44:46,670 --> 02:44:48,670
They're doing pretty good.

3658
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:50,000
Didn't want to throw the ball.

3659
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:53,450
Might be a random toy now.

3660
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:56,299
Maybe not.

3661
02:44:57,629 --> 02:44:58,590
No, he's still very good.

3662
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:04,559
Oh, it's trying to bounce that back to you.

3663
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:16,239
Oh, there I go.

3664
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:16,879
Oh, yeah.

3665
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:18,079
Oh, my God.

3666
02:45:18,079 --> 02:45:19,440
That's what I'm talking about.

3667
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:28,969
Okay.

3668
02:45:28,969 --> 02:45:29,930
That was good.

3669
02:45:29,930 --> 02:45:31,129
One for blue.

3670
02:45:31,129 --> 02:45:33,600
This is even though.

3671
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:52,600
Oh, careful.

3672
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,760
Whoa, let's go.

3673
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:55,399
Oh, man.

3674
02:45:57,559 --> 02:45:58,200
That's gay.

3675
02:45:58,200 --> 02:45:59,879
I was like, maybe if I'm going off stage,

3676
02:45:59,879 --> 02:46:01,559
it'll bring me out to you.

3677
02:46:01,559 --> 02:46:05,239
And then we get to play in the tournament.

3678
02:46:05,239 --> 02:46:06,680
That would have been exciting.

3679
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:08,120
That was a good matchup.

3680
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:09,399
I think it was pretty even.

3681
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,360
Rock with the four kills.

3682
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,319
300 damage.

3683
02:46:13,319 --> 02:46:15,639
You just like I've always had 360.

3684
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,879
Why do we didn't get the best match

3685
02:46:17,879 --> 02:46:18,760
of the day on a stream?

3686
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:20,200
You know, he didn't.

3687
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:22,360
That was probably a more entertaining

3688
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:24,040
two best of three is both more entertaining

3689
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:25,079
than every set.

3690
02:46:25,079 --> 02:46:26,440
Love a guy today.

3691
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:27,180
That was a good fight.

3692
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:27,979
Good match.

3693
02:46:27,979 --> 02:46:29,340
Let's play you guys.

3694
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:30,059
Oh, that was awesome.

3695
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:31,420
I had a lot of fun.

3696
02:46:31,739 --> 02:46:34,719
Hey, multiverses.

3697
02:46:34,719 --> 02:46:35,819
Let's do more events.

3698
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:37,260
More events.

3699
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:37,819
It's fun.

3700
02:46:37,819 --> 02:46:38,459
More events.

3701
02:46:38,459 --> 02:46:41,819
Weekly Ludwig tournaments until one of us wins.

3702
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:43,500
Yeah.

3703
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:46,399
And so we all like get a couple thousand dollars.

3704
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:48,959
I think all the placements should just make the same.

3705
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:50,559
I mean, why?

3706
02:46:50,559 --> 02:46:53,520
You know, why word based on how good you did.

3707
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:54,719
Like that makes people feel bad.

3708
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:56,559
So let's just, you know.

3709
02:46:56,559 --> 02:46:58,159
Hey, I'm all right being fifth place.

3710
02:46:58,159 --> 02:47:00,159
About eight dollars to fourth and fifth.

3711
02:47:00,159 --> 02:47:00,959
Or four and a half.

3712
02:47:00,959 --> 02:47:01,520
Right.

3713
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:02,000
Technically.

3714
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:03,920
Yeah.

3715
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:07,200
Hey, you guys have good streams.

3716
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:07,920
I'm out now.

3717
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:08,239
Yeah.

3718
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:08,719
All right.

3719
02:47:08,719 --> 02:47:09,040
Yeah.

3720
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:09,680
Let's play now.

3721
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:10,079
Run.

3722
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,040
Thanks playing, guys.

3723
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:12,399
You may be in the next Ludwig event.

3724
02:47:12,399 --> 02:47:13,280
Who knows?

3725
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:13,840
Yeah.

3726
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:15,479
Ooh, Fortnite.

3727
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:18,649
So can I keep playing?

3728
02:47:19,770 --> 02:47:20,649
Is that it for you?

3729
02:47:20,649 --> 02:47:21,370
How do you feel?

3730
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:24,719
I think I might go play something else a bit soon.

3731
02:47:24,719 --> 02:47:25,040
All right.

3732
02:47:27,159 --> 02:47:28,319
It's been fun, though.

3733
02:47:28,879 --> 02:47:29,840
It has been a good time.

3734
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:32,780
Hey, we had a good showing.

3735
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:33,659
I think we did.

3736
02:47:33,659 --> 02:47:34,540
We played pretty well.

3737
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:35,739
We really did.

3738
02:47:35,739 --> 02:47:38,139
We lost to the two winners finals teams.

3739
02:47:38,139 --> 02:47:39,500
I think grand finals teams.

3740
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:41,319
So, you know, at the end of the day,

3741
02:47:41,799 --> 02:47:44,399
some are saying we were the best team there.

3742
02:47:44,399 --> 02:47:45,680
Yeah, I say one of the best team.

3743
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:49,309
We're one of the top eight teams there.

3744
02:47:49,309 --> 02:47:49,870
That is true.

3745
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:53,549
We were in the top eight.

3746
02:47:53,549 --> 02:47:55,520
Yeah, it's always a pleasure, dude.

3747
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:56,159
Dude, of course.

3748
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:56,719
It was fun.

3749
02:47:56,719 --> 02:47:58,159
Have a great rest of your stream.

3750
02:47:58,159 --> 02:47:59,290
Yeah, we'll talk soon.

3751
02:47:59,290 --> 02:48:00,250
I'll see you.

3752
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:04,489
Take care, dude.

3753
02:48:04,489 --> 02:48:05,290
All right.

3754
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:06,250
So that's that.

3755
02:48:06,250 --> 02:48:10,559
That was multi-versus tournament.

3756
02:48:10,559 --> 02:48:11,920
Yeah, honestly, we played really well.

3757
02:48:17,079 --> 02:48:18,920
We probably could have been fourth or third.

3758
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:19,799
We probably could have.

3759
02:48:19,799 --> 02:48:24,459
That was a lot of fun, though.

3760
02:48:24,459 --> 02:48:26,780
It's fun to play a game and be like kind of good at it.

3761
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:27,899
Like be okay at it.

3762
02:48:27,899 --> 02:48:31,739
Are you going to leave?

3763
02:48:31,739 --> 02:48:32,760
Yes.

3764
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:35,399
So for those of you that aren't aware,

3765
02:48:35,399 --> 02:48:40,319
I'm still dealing with an obnoxious fucking medical problem

3766
02:48:40,319 --> 02:48:42,159
that it just comes and goes, comes and goes.

3767
02:48:42,159 --> 02:48:43,280
And it's causing me a ton of problems.

3768
02:48:44,079 --> 02:48:45,040
I'm fine.

3769
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:47,129
But I need, like I said before,

3770
02:48:47,129 --> 02:48:50,219
I want to do more streams this week, but less time.

3771
02:48:50,219 --> 02:48:51,260
And I didn't stream yesterday.

3772
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:54,379
I wanted to go like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

3773
02:48:54,379 --> 02:48:56,250
But we started on Wednesday.

3774
02:48:56,250 --> 02:48:57,209
We're going to do Wednesday.

3775
02:48:57,209 --> 02:49:00,190
Tomorrow, I believe, I'm going to go check and see.

3776
02:49:00,190 --> 02:49:03,239
I think the myth call of duty thing is tomorrow.

3777
02:49:03,239 --> 02:49:07,389
So more networking Andy tomorrow.

3778
02:49:07,389 --> 02:49:08,799
That should be funny.

3779
02:49:08,799 --> 02:49:11,579
Okay, because I played well today.

3780
02:49:11,579 --> 02:49:15,020
I'm going to be the worst fucking player on any team tomorrow.

3781
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:16,059
It's going to be embarrassing.

3782
02:49:16,059 --> 02:49:19,040
So if you want to watch me make an absolute fool out of myself in call of duty,

3783
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:20,159
it's not going to be funny.

3784
02:49:20,159 --> 02:49:25,100
It's going to be embarrassing for all of us as a collective entire community.

3785
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:26,219
So I hope you're ready.

3786
02:49:27,850 --> 02:49:29,530
But if that happens, if that happens,

3787
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:32,600
it'll be, I might stream my perspective.

3788
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:34,280
If not, it'll be on Myth's channel on YouTube.

3789
02:49:35,209 --> 02:49:36,299
We'll see.

3790
02:49:36,299 --> 02:49:40,059
But on Friday, we're going to do two point campus.

3791
02:49:40,059 --> 02:49:43,639
And then maybe mortuary assistant.

3792
02:49:43,639 --> 02:49:45,399
And then Sunday is green screen movie night.

3793
02:49:45,399 --> 02:49:48,440
And then Monday, we're doing a hangout stream where we talk about baseball.

3794
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:52,590
And then obviously baseball is a few days later.

3795
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:54,670
And then we'll do sorcery when I come back from baseball.

3796
02:49:54,670 --> 02:49:59,129
So we'll see.

3797
02:49:59,129 --> 02:50:02,479
But yeah, I'm trying to not sit here for too long.

3798
02:50:04,379 --> 02:50:05,979
I'll leave out the minute details.

3799
02:50:05,979 --> 02:50:11,020
But there's been annoying things I've had to deal with over the last week or two.

3800
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:11,579
But I'm all right.

3801
02:50:11,579 --> 02:50:12,219
I'll be fine.

3802
02:50:12,219 --> 02:50:14,489
I'll be good for baseball.

3803
02:50:14,489 --> 02:50:15,610
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3804
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:17,579
We'll go for like another three, four hours tomorrow.

3805
02:50:17,579 --> 02:50:19,500
And then Friday will be a little longer.

3806
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:21,950
Because we're probably going to play two games on Friday.

3807
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:24,540
Is it the back problem?

3808
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:27,200
It's a combination of a few things that have just,

3809
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:32,479
it's just been a thorn in my side for the last two or three weeks.

3810
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:33,040
But I'm good.

3811
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:33,600
I'm all right.

3812
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,120
I feel, I feel, I feel okay today.

3813
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,680
Right.

3814
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:37,530
But I don't want to go too hard.

3815
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:41,149
But I'll see you tomorrow.

3816
02:50:41,149 --> 02:50:45,610
Keep an eye on what's happening with the Call of Duty thing.

3817
02:50:45,610 --> 02:50:48,250
If there is, if for some reason there is no Call of Duty thing,

3818
02:50:48,250 --> 02:50:49,690
then we'll play something tomorrow.

3819
02:50:49,690 --> 02:50:50,809
We'll do something else.

3820
02:50:50,809 --> 02:50:52,090
So there'll be a stream tomorrow.

3821
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:56,139
And with that, let's, we'll raid Connor.

3822
02:50:56,139 --> 02:50:57,180
Because we were just playing with Connor.

3823
02:50:57,180 --> 02:51:02,159
I think Connor's still streaming.

3824
02:51:02,159 --> 02:51:04,040
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

3825
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:06,280
Also, obviously thanks to Ludwig for the invite.

3826
02:51:06,280 --> 02:51:09,229
I don't, if they, if they, are they still doing there?

3827
02:51:09,229 --> 02:51:10,190
Is it, is it over?

3828
02:51:10,190 --> 02:51:13,639
I don't know, but that was, that was awesome.

3829
02:51:13,639 --> 02:51:18,139
Thanks for watching, obviously.

3830
02:51:18,139 --> 02:51:19,549
You're around tomorrow?

3831
02:51:19,549 --> 02:51:22,590
You're around tomorrow?

3832
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:26,889
Either the Mortuary Assistant or Myth's Call of Duty event.

3833
02:51:26,889 --> 02:51:30,489
I'll put a sus command when I figure out everything.

3834
02:51:30,489 --> 02:51:35,770
Yeah, we'll raid Connor.

3835
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:45,610
Let's go for it.

3836
02:51:45,610 --> 02:51:46,809
I need a horror game.

3837
02:51:46,809 --> 02:51:50,780
The only reason why I wouldn't do the Mortuary Assistant tomorrow

3838
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:54,860
is if I don't want to be like screaming and tense up and have a problem.

3839
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:55,819
And then fuck myself up.

3840
02:51:55,819 --> 02:51:57,020
So we'll see tomorrow.

3841
02:51:57,020 --> 02:51:57,979
There will be a stream tomorrow.

3842
02:51:57,979 --> 02:51:59,340
We'll see, we'll see what it is.

3843
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:07,840
But I'm, we'll wing it.

3844
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:13,319
Thanks again, guys.

3845
02:52:13,319 --> 02:52:16,200
And here we go, let's raid Connor.

3846
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:17,719
Whatever Connor is doing.

3847
02:52:17,719 --> 02:52:21,959
Thanks, I wasn't paying too much attention to much

3848
02:52:21,959 --> 02:52:23,639
because I was focusing on obviously trying to win.

3849
02:52:23,639 --> 02:52:25,840
But that was Multi Versus.

3850
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:26,639
Go get it.

3851
02:52:26,639 --> 02:52:27,280
Go try it.

3852
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:28,799
The game's free and it's fun.

3853
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:30,329
That's all that needs to be said about it.

3854
02:52:30,329 --> 02:52:32,360
What time tomorrow?

3855
02:52:33,159 --> 02:52:34,840
Probably around the same time I started today.

3856
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:36,680
Like probably around two or three o'clock Pacific.

3857
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:47,420
That was a chill tournament stream.

3858
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:51,229
Yeah, sometimes you just play games and that's fine.

3859
02:52:51,790 --> 02:52:56,319
You know, I got to prove that I know how to use a controller.

3860
02:52:56,319 --> 02:52:59,440
I got to prove that I don't hold the controller upside down every stream.

3861
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:07,610
All right.

3862
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:08,409
Good night, guys.

3863
02:53:08,409 --> 02:53:09,129
See you soon.

3864
02:53:09,129 --> 02:53:10,620
Take care.

3865
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:11,340
Bye, mother.

3866
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,100
Have a great night.
