00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:19,449
Hey. Good afternoon. How are you? Am I on time finally? You're on time. I'm on time too.

2
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,649
Just barely. You were sitting there looking out the window waiting for like the electrician to

3
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:34,250
show up in the window and it was like 358 and you're walking back and forth pacing like this is

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,969
unfucking believable. Where is he? Should I call? I'm gonna call the manager and you have the phone

5
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:49,289
in your hand and right at 359 the truck pulls up and you're like yeah you made it okay you made it

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,219
but here's the thing it took me like four or five uh seconds afterwards to put my pants on

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,020
so I'm like sitting here putting my pants on like getting ready to come in here and I technically

8
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:21,510
it's like it's 402 right now but I the truck pulled up at four get your pants on dude I swear to god

9
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,269
so so twitch let me tell you something about like something that doesn't make no sense

10
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:36,230
so if I stream to the test server like the twitch test server I don't I drop like no frames

11
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:44,069
the second I actually press the go live button and stream to the fucking actual twitch I drop a

12
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:55,609
thousand frames what the fuck is this it doesn't make any sense like there's a test server to make

13
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:03,180
sure that your stream is gonna work and instantly I was running that for like an hour and fucking

14
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,759
instantly to the same server I actually turned the stream on not going to the test server and

15
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:19,509
10 percent of all stream frames are dropped what they're the same server it's the same so I gotta

16
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:28,069
talk to twitch about this because that doesn't make that make no sense why on earth would I

17
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,710
drop the amount of frames that I've dropped in an hour of testing to twitch's server this

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:46,439
test server is the same server as the one I'm streaming to right now huh what maybe twitch

19
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,759
can help me route it somewhere else oh my god you gotta be fucking kidding me you gotta be

20
00:02:52,759 --> 00:03:02,650
fucking kidding me this is really really really fucked up I wish I had any idea why this is

21
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,360
happening the second I actually go live

22
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,199
it's going to the same place twitch what's happening to me why is this happening it makes

23
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:33,590
no fucking sense nobody can tell me why this is happening well anyways hey I know how to fix

24
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,580
this problem hurry up turn on the fucking facecam nobody will remember your your 2000 drop frames

25
00:03:40,580 --> 00:04:02,939
in 10 minutes not even five minutes this is like as bad as it's ever been but I got a black t-shirt

26
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:10,789
on what I'm just staring at it for a little bit this is a comb stream so nothing matters today

27
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:30,009
your webcam is 60 fps now I ask because I tweaked it is this stream canon no none of my streams I

28
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:43,769
can't they're all extended universe what the fuck I'm out of here I'm out oh I'm out of here

29
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:11,579
why there's no fucking logical reason for the shit anyways uh hi guys welcome to the stream

30
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:23,769
it's uh with 3000 frames so far to the to the same server I was just streaming to

31
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:33,620
I was just streaming to the Los Angeles server but not broadcasting out to users

32
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,259
and I press the fight to delete the fucking test broadcast button

33
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:53,100
and go live with a regular twitch to the same server and it's fucked oh my god

34
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:06,089
would it look good with one of these like let's look like one of these like little hairs

35
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:21,430
I was like what do they call this try it under the nose would I look good with one of these

36
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:41,860
that's like saturday morning cartoon villain whatever was bent a little which fucking like

37
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:58,120
moron Mario uh cousin of mine hold on I ain't gonna I ain't leaving I ain't fucking going

38
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:07,720

39
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:19,220
myself out uh don't do that it's the Jim Carrey Robotnik but here's the good thing about this

40
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,810
though uh this is this is just comb stream so but that doesn't matter I want this to fucking work

41
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:37,019
oh pack it up pack it up I'm moving pack it up put everything in a box I'm fucking out of here

43
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:20,069
doesn't mean I need to leave Las Vegas by the way fucking 4,000 drop frames in not in nine minutes

44
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,629
I don't think I've dropped 4,000 drop frames in two hours last night do you understand how this

45
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,430
makes no sense like is anybody in here like a networking person to even describe to me

46
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:36,230
why last night this is not even 24 hours ago it's green for fucking like six hours straight

47
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,190
and then now it's it's like it don't even want to breathe it can't even

48
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:54,259

53
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:10,759
exponentially worse oh if I if I wasn't if I wasn't like a nice human being I would scream as

84
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:07,929
what okay so uh what what has happened in the time that I have not been here

85
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,269
I have done a few things I have downloaded and set up a uh a packet loss prevention

86
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:39,179
VPN and strangely enough I think it worked look at this it's green it's it's green it's been green

87
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:47,799
for like 25 minutes okay I'm telling you I'm I will tell you the company's name if we okay

88
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:54,360
here's the thing right right hold on hold on if we get like a couple days of complete green video

89
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,370
oh I will but you'll it'll I will give this company as much attention as they want

90
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:10,140
I will shake the goddamn CEO's hand on camera I will shake their hand on camera and take like

91
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:23,690
fucking president photos with them because seriously like if this works it's been hell

92
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:31,960
trying to get this to be fucking fixed it might we may still drop frames but I don't know if

93
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:43,099
it'll be as awful as it is I don't know I'm willing to try anything did it cost anything

94
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:50,180
it was free to try and the amount of data that I'm going to be obviously pumping through

95
00:17:51,299 --> 00:18:01,500
it costs money but here's the thing this service is this service is not free after you do it for a

96
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,109
while actually it's free up to a certain point but let's not talk about let's just let's just

97
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:19,019
stream and see what happens let's just do a live stream and see what happens but I will tell you

98
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:29,720
it is cheaper than you think it is okay for a whole year of this service it is cheaper than buying

99
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:52,710
one Nintendo Wii game if that gives me a green fucking bar for a year that's worth it it is a

100
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:11,380
pay service how much is a Nintendo Wii game a Nintendo Wii game is 50 dollars so on in my

101
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,220
opinion in my opinion what's happening what has been happening well I don't know this this is

102
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:26,380
obviously too early to talk about this but if this is fine and it's back to normal then the

103
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,960
issue is about routing the connection somewhere along the way Cox has these routing fucking

104
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:43,380
problems to whatever servers I'm trying to go to but I'm not gonna I'm just gonna let's just turn

105
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,099
on the let's just go I'm not gonna tweet this out yet because I want to make sure that I'm gonna

106
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:54,710
I want like 10 minutes of green I had the exact same problem a couple months ago and my VPN fixed

107
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:04,700
my problems too and this is specifically this is a packet loss preventing VPN I don't know where

108
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:15,910
the fucking data is going at this point I I could fucking care less where where happens to it I

109
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:23,559
I don't care does it work oh hold on a VPN might be like sniffing out I don't get I don't give a

110
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:33,289
shit this is a green do we have a green light I didn't get a chance to comb this fucking hair

111
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:42,490
once on camera and now it's like it's it's it's too it's it's too like corroded I my hair is too

112
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:55,940
corroded it was wet you're giving people your so no it's just it's like what okay it's a credit

113
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:04,950
card and it's a service that's reviewed very highly okay this is not a low reviewed service

114
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:20,039
it has pretty decent numbers no it's fine it's gonna be fine okay I'm not giving look at this

115
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,450
hair and I didn't this is supposed to be a comb stream today no drop frames in fucking almost

116
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:33,059
10 minutes are you kidding me are you kidding me and I got like a big zit over here that I'm not

117
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:42,140
gonna show you you downloaded a virus well this virus sure does make my internet work better

118
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,049
okay I don't care well what if it's like sniffing out your packets oh good I don't give a shit

119
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:56,329
whatever you're gonna see me go to like fucking like my mail and open up like my bank actually

120
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:00,009
that's probably bad I'm gonna do okay from now on I'm gonna open up my bank account stuff on my phone

121
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:10,650
oh shit maybe I should uh no but honestly God what they're gonna see me play like

122
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:16,250
what's they're gonna see what steam game I bought yesterday not that I don't have a very fucking

123
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:28,539
crazy life but I probably had to just do everything on my like phone now you have protected traffic

124
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,660
exactly I'm fine everything's fine I am just like kind of I'm pretty manic right now I've got like

125
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,140
pretty like big I got like mania right now because this is almost 10 minutes of no drop frames

126
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,700
and it was like 20 minutes of no drop frames before I actually turn the stream I'm going

127
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:53,319
through this service and you're not you'll get a name soon you'll get a name soon I don't know

128
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,319
why I'm holding that I'm holding back the name because if this drops to zero in like the next

129
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:07,910
20 minutes and like it didn't even do anything you'll get the name soon don't worry nice hair

182
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:49,109
so here there's that this that's block one here's block like two three four five so that those guys

183
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:54,230
those guys will never know my name right why would they underneath that you've got um like

184
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,230
the supervising team and these are the people that like actually have to pay his edge and

185
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,109
and take care of things right and there's there's like a million there's like millions of customers

186
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:09,109
okay so avoiding this showing this is it you're you're very you're very observational uh yes you

187
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:23,700
are we're doing the profile today let me just get it out of the way okay there take a screenshot

188
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:42,490
of this not take a screenshot of this those are the same people that was the same person

189
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:55,259
you have fat don't push me today because i might rip these fucking handles off the chair what kind

190

of somebody asked what kind of chair i have i don't know fucking staples whatever it is

191
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:10,950
oh anyways okay so the here here is the the the rest of the rest of the pyramid

192
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,630
that's not to say that this is a pyramid scheme but i'm just saying it's it's like

193
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:20,630
shaped that way whatever so you got underneath like the supervising team you've got the guys

194
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,269
that come out in the truck okay guys that actually fix the nodes and they do the neighborhood work

195
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,869
and they do the maintenance they they work hard they do because they travel around all over the

196
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,789
place they've got tons of fucking complaints that's like the supervising team then underneath that

197
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,930
you've got like the techs that come out to reset your modem that just reset everybody's modem and

198
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,130
that's all they do they just go out and they go oh i guess i need to reset your modem i think it

199
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:47,940
is that that's like down here there's like a lot of that okay underneath that underneath that is

200
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,099
like the phone support and i'm talking about what people what people can do right i'm not saying that

201
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:58,180
like any job is more or less valuable what i'm saying is like the guy in the truck can do way

202
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,329
more than the person that's on the phone down here right so the person on the phone that you call

203
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:10,420
customer support is what they're capable of doing is telling the guy up here to do something about

204
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:16,019
it one of the those people here that guy then has to tell somebody up here to get actual do some

205
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,700
stuff in the truck and get it worked out right that guy then has to talk to one of the fucking

206
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
suit people to find out if they need to do more infrastructural work right that guy then goes

207
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:31,220
into the fucking throne room with the guy with the gold throne and he's sitting there like this i

208
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,240
imagine the ceo just sitting in like a golden throne like like a king and the like peasants have

209
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:45,799
to come in and be like so excuse me oh neil before sire uh over on uh in in and bumble dune down the

210
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:55,180
street we have um 10 000 dropped frames sire it's hard for us and he just said like 10 000

211
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:03,109
drop frames oh that's that's pretty bad but you know over there in in fucking england too whatever

212
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:08,949
we're gonna call it i had 25 000 dropped for and they have to make a decision right so then i get

213
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,269
up and i have like i got like the look i'll do the other side so it makes more sense for you

214
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:21,289
sire you have so many dropped frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to amazon

215
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:31,610
and buy cases of ocean spray juice because that's and small small figurines of venom we need to and

216
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:40,070
then he gets he looks over and he finally makes a decision right so when that determined when that

217
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,469
person has said it's 20 minutes by the way only 400 drop frames that's not bad so

218
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:55,510
my point is the person on twitter i'm talking about what they are capable of doing what they're

219
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:04,550
capable of doing if i were to send a tweet to cox customer care twitter or the guy that drives the

220
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:13,539
bus down the road i think this person would be able to do more for me that person would come out

221
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:33,769
and probably like oh something's wrong there i don't know but i what do you mean all right

222
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,980
i'm gonna be serious here i'm gonna be real get the comb out of my hair do not leave leave these

223
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,340
people alone don't do that don't like harass any employee that's not cool don't fucking do that

224
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:55,219
you guys are better than that but i really don't think that i that that i have like people up here

225
00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:07,190
that are currently aware of it my point is is that that process starts all over again the people

226
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,989
that like are on the phone that are down here somewhere that like have to relay and relay and

227
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:17,829
relay i've already done that like seven times we've already relayed to the supervisor to like the

228
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:24,760
field supervisor to like the real super like they know they know they know the problem already so i

229
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,760
going to like the cox customer care twitter is the essentially calling cox customers care

230
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,340
like on the phone and being like hey uh my internet just turned off for the first time

231
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,940
there are people up here that already know did you tell them that i'm driven 985

00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:27,269
that you don't enjoy it is not it's not let me get this on the screen it has nothing to do

235
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:36,780
but the people that are working for cox they can't like there's only so much that they can do

236
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:45,539
it's not like their fault it's not their problem it really isn't it's how i've been explained this

256
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,539
i know i love talking to people i do you often spend time exploring unrealistic yet intriguing

257
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:53,590
ideas all the fucking time there are there are streams that i have tried to do that just

258
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:59,699
completely unrealistic we're never ever gonna happen but i tried anyways i have like stuff on

259
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:07,030
my mouth am i like frothing at the mouth am i like turning into like am i turning rabid

260
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,280
ow this is what i'm talking about i can't like comb my hair on these streams now

261
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:22,179
my hair is turning into like uncooked ramen noodles okay your travel plans are more likely

262
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:32,550
to look like a rough list of ideas than a detailed itinerary i i like to have some kind of plan

263
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:40,659
but not completely outrageous i feel like i'm getting these wrong because like they're all

264
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:45,739
agree all right no no no okay that that's correct i do i like to just kind of go and do i like to

265
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:57,289
plan now hold on i plan some stuff but not everything some stuff is is really really

266
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:04,760
highly planned and mo i would say more than yeah you often think about what you should have said

267
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:15,420
in a conversation long after it's taken place no i don't i don't i don't give a shit i mean i'm

268
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:25,380
not one of the okay hold on i'm not one of those people that's just like no because i i look i

269
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,610
just say the things i say i don't like think about long after their conversations over what

270
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:40,329
i should have said no i've just said it what about years later if your friend is sad about

271
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,489
something your first instinct is to support them emotionally not to try to solve their problem

272
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:54,309
well it depends on what they're sad about like okay if it's let's say it's like a like a little

273
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:59,110
kid like drops the ice cream on the ground just go i can go get another ice cream and there it is

274
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:05,909
and it's not i just solved your problem in a minute right okay what but what if i could see

275
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:20,969
that's a bad parent wait what do you mean bad parent hold on so if you're like kid dropped

276
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:27,099

277
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:31,900
like but i okay what if what if like the worker like didn't get it in there well and it just like

278
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,300
fell out and like oh god and the work was like oh yeah you're right i didn't secure that i didn't

279
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:57,619
secure the ice cream in there good enough the ice what what all right besides that you didn't secure

280
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:06,039
the ice cream you have to take them with you to develop what do you what just don't drop it

281
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:16,409
because i would buy my son or daughter an ice cream that they dropped on the ground or try to

282
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:25,849
get another one that makes me like a crazy person what the fuck are you talking about

283
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:36,760
all right but uh i would i would do that first i would just try to support and then maybe like

284
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:54,409
how do we maybe fix this right yeah people can rarely upset you it depends on the day because

285
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:59,269
like i don't know some days some days somebody could like hit me in the face with a door and

286
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:07,909
i'd be like oh oh you know well people are people are blood all over my mouth people are clumsy you

287
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:12,789
know it's okay don't worry about that have a wonderful rest of your day you need anything

288
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:19,349
like some days it's like that but other days somebody could literally sneeze like 15 tables

289
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:29,900
over and i'm just like stop don't fucking sneeze i don't know it got it i caught that you know

290
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:41,449
i'm saying it's not like it depends on the day that's probably right in the middle because

291
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:51,269
sometimes you just are irritated sometimes you're just like having a good day no it no right in the

292
00:45:51,269 --> 00:46:03,099
middle all right let's go next page i'm only 10 percent of the way through this it was said 12

293
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:08,940
minutes you often rely on other people to be the ones to start a conversation to keep it going no

294
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,440
strongly disagree i'm always like throwing out fucking shit to talk about i'm always just like

295
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:21,909
hey what about this what about that what about this what about that so yeah i i'm always want

296
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:27,980
to start conversations if you have to temporarily put your plans on hold you make sure it is your

297
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:46,119
top priority to get back on track as soon as possible no unfortunately not that disagree but

298
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:52,389
i they come back to normal like they gradually come back you rarely worry if you made a good

299
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:57,110
impression on someone you met so like i don't really worry if i make a good impression

300
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:08,230
i wouldn't say that's a strong agree because like i i don't know i don't really think about

301
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,630
that too much but not that completely oh i don't give a shit you know what i mean

302
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:22,920
no i think that's correct you always talk about people coming in here for the first time

303
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,360
this is my first time watching and you suck well that's interesting because you have a four month

304
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:46,579
sub badge that would be uh very odd god do you see that vein is that healthy that was big

305
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:50,420
that means i'm healthy right that means like there's a ton of blood going up into my brain

306
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,789
right okay no that's great it would be a challenge for you to spend the whole day

307
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:01,190
no it would be a challenge for you to spend the whole weekend all by yourself without feeling

308
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:12,260
bored yeah i can't i have to like i feel like it'd be somewhere i have to be with somebody

309
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:21,780
something yeah that would be a challenge maybe not that much because sometimes you do

310
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:31,300
want some alone time right okay you are more you are more of a detail oriented than a big picture

311
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:42,550
person i just i'm a big picture you are very affectionate with people you care about yeah i

312
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:55,659
think so somewhere in here you keep asking us about the answers for your personality yeah but

313
00:48:55,659 --> 00:49:02,460
i mean come on 10 minutes by the way you have a careful and methodical approach to life absolutely

314
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:18,889
not you are still bothered by the mistakes you made a long time ago no i no i oh shit strongly

315
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:37,019
um what about the book no people you grow you know what i mean you grow you learn you grow

316
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:50,179
and you become the person that you are no i i just i kind of disagree at parties and similar

317
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:58,679
events you can mostly be found farther away from the action i don't know does this imply like the

318
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:05,670
the dance circle at the wedding because like okay there's the i love the dance circle at the wedding

319
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:14,380
but i don't really like the when it gets when it gets too crazy you know the dance circle of the

320
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,420
wedding is fun and then you're like all right i want to go back over to like the bar and just

321
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,989
sit around and like watch so i don't know probably like right here now jerma lied about the clown car

322
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:36,519
just gave five community subs thank you that's five community subs right now it's a fucking lot

323
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:41,699
thank you so much jerma lied about the clown car big subs don't look at that

324
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,590
you often find it difficult to relate to people who let their emotions guide them

325
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:57,059
somewhere in the middle because i don't know because like sometimes i think there needs to be

326
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:12,059
a balanced approach to stuff like that maybe a slight disagree because um i i i'm i'm fairly

327
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:22,150
like emotional for certain things i said don't answer neutral yeah that's right i did one neutral

328
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:32,179
i know i'm trying not to answer neutral that i slightly disagree when looking for a movie to

329
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:38,809
watch you can spend ages browsing the catalog no nope i just i don't care what it is i'll pick

330
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:44,309
something for fun um i here's the thing i actually do this thing this is fun to do

331
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:50,949
uh the next time you're on netflix or you're on hulu doesn't matter right a fun uh project is

332
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,110
to find a movie that you've never seen that you'll never watch that you're like i will never fucking

333
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:00,869
watch um i there's no reason why i'm gonna watch uh the other guys too right i'm just i'm not gonna

334
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:05,349
i'm not gonna do that there's no reason why i would do it i just i it's not a movie i'm gonna

335
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:11,110
pick to watch it's if it's on tv i'm not gonna watch it but what you do is you do the 20 skip

336
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:18,389
and how that works is you start the movie and you watch for about 60 to 120 seconds and then you

337
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:25,829
skip 20 minutes watch for about 60 seconds skip 20 minutes watch for 60 to 120 seconds skip 20

338
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:33,219
minutes and you'll get the essentially the 20 skip of the whole movie and you'll be able to like

339
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:36,260
just take it in you'll be able to see at least seven to eight minutes of a movie

340
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,440
and you're not gonna watch this fucking movie anyways so just have fun and just skip through

341
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:49,190
it and just see what they do just look at like the weird shit they do on camera you're fucked up no

342
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:54,230
but i'm not gonna watch that movie i'm not going to watch that movie okay think of movies that you've

343
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,670
scrolled through on netflix that you're just like i will never click that because i'm not gonna give

344
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:06,900
an hour and 45 minutes to um what the hell was the name of that movie the last one i did this

345
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:13,940
with was uh it was a will ferrell and mark walberg movie and it was uh what the hell was it

346
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:23,260
they were like dad dad's home daddy's here dad's home too dad's home too right what was it called

347
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:35,349
dad's here what is it called the dad it would where we are where the dad's too

348
00:53:39,590 --> 00:54:05,750
no somebody knows what this is daddy's home too right no not stepdad um no gibson's in this movie

349
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:21,820
i'm pulling that hand away ever so slightly saved daddy's home too okay we're good we're good so

350
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,219
uh daddy's home too is the last one i did this with and i would do it again because there's no

351
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:32,969
way i'm gonna give two hours to daddy's home too i watched like nine minutes of this movie and i

352
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:38,940
i feel like i've already seen it there's a dad's home one yeah so no i just pick shit and just

353
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,309
will watch it for fun sometimes doesn't matter what it is you can stay calm under a lot of pressure

354
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:54,329
yeah strongly agree but i can stay real fucking calm now don't say that the internet problems

355
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:58,809
are cracking under pressure because the internet okay listen the internet problems

356
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:11,190
that's not pressure that is that is like that's not even pressure that is just extreme stress

357
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:17,860
you know i'm saying it's not just oh well something's happening today that i gotta be

358
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,579
calm about this is literally somebody just like throwing darts into your chest for like a year

359
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:28,500
eventually you're gonna be like can you stop throwing fucking darts at me like

360
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,769
you're gonna have like seven okay 700 darts go into my chest this is like getting 700 darts

361
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:41,769
thrown at you over the course of a year i i walk out the door like this is a you live a completely

362
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:46,409
normal life and i open the door sometimes and there's just the there's the dark guy and he's

363
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:54,260
just lining up the shot and you're like okay go ahead and he's just like hold on and it bounces

364
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,579
it doesn't go it's not gonna he didn't throw it hard enough for it to go and it just hits you in

365
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:01,750
the chest and falls down and you have like a mark that happens that by the way this happens like

366
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:11,849
two or three times a week after a year you're gonna like kick out the dark guy you're gonna be

367
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:18,820
like don't fucking get don't come in my house ever again he's gonna look at you like what don't don't

368
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:23,219
leave don't ever come back get the fuck out of my house and he'll just be like with his bag and

369
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:29,179
like his bag fucking darts on his back like okay all right bye you'll never see me again and you're

370
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:33,659
like yeah get the fuck out of here dart asshole okay fine bye you're never gonna see me again

371
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:40,380
the door closes and he's gone by the way two months later um a dart hits your like window

372
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,460
and you look out you're like that motherfucker and he's just like

373
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:51,699
and he fucking runs away he never leaves you alone so after a year of that you're probably

374
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:57,980
gonna be pretty annoyed with the dart guy but i mean i yeah i'm pretty good under pressure

375
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:07,099
somebody just get 50 bucks who was it don't look at that zip i was ryan hogs gave 50 dollars

00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:08,650
a little bit of slack it'll okay i'm not and when i'm 40 this will probably be all the way but yeah

five more subs come and thank you guys when in a group of people you do not know you have no

395
00:59:55,179 --> 01:00:02,409
problem jumping right into the conversation i can do that very easily i just go like hey i scroll on

396
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:06,250
like this and everybody like notices that you did that and they're like who's this guy was this guy

397
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:10,409
funny and then i go kind of and i like get in there and i just start talking about whatever

398
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:14,010
you got to get in there like this if you and here's a good icebreaker like oh like we're

399
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:21,289
at a party it's like rolling hey everyone's just like oh this guy this guy might be like a funny

400
01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:32,059
guy don't do that by the way uh when yeah but i can when you sleep your dreams tend to be bizarre

401
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:42,219
and fantastical um does this count as like crazy nightmare shit i had a dream a couple nights ago

402
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:49,059
that there was this big gigantic thick paint wall of glass and they were like three or four people

403
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:54,340
around me then i don't know what they were doing they were like just hanging out right and they

404
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,460
were taking turns trying to run and jump and break the glass with their bodies this just was this was

405
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,849
like as big as a whole wall like in like a mural of like just glass i'm just like what the why you

406
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:08,710
guys do what are you guys doing they're just like yeah come on man and like running like making a

407
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:13,739
dent bang and like the little spider weapon breakout and then finally after like probably

408
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:18,860
six or seven more attempts at this one of them actually got through it was like he broke through

409
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:25,460
and he fell back and landed and like he got like cuts all over and he was like bleeding he was like

410
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,260
ah like screaming and like blood was coming out of his back and shit and i was like why why did

411
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:41,000
you do that does that count at least nightmares because sometimes they're like that yeah that

412
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,460
counts in your opinion it is sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead in life well they're

413
01:01:47,460 --> 01:02:00,070
dialing up the questions into fucked up territory is it sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead

414
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:14,650
no it's not do it do it yourself do it yourself don't use people i'm talking more of like like a

415
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:23,159
strict like in in the in a don't use people don't like just step on somebody to get to the top

416
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:29,719
now get to the top on your own get to the top because you you belong at the top right you know

417
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:40,150
you know what i'm saying get to the top because like you belong at the top you know what i mean

418
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:45,849
i'm kidding i'm kidding jesus you are dedicated and focused on your goals only rarely getting

419
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:52,389
i don't need to even talk about that one if you make a mistake you tend to start doubting yourself

420
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:59,019
your abilities or your knowledge no i typically take take a mistake and turn it into something

421
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:05,050
else that works when at a social event you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people

422
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:10,659
and mostly talk to the ones you already know that's that's pretty that's kind of true i think that's

423
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:21,130
true for everybody though most people don't just go walk up to strangers and do the fucking thing

424
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:28,949
that i told you not to do people don't really do that if i if i would be introduced to somebody

425
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:35,019
from somebody else then that's a completely different story but typically you just kind of

426
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:43,900
hang out with the people that you were there with yeah that's accurate you usually lose interest

427
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:53,880
in a discussion when it gets philosophical ah that's like fun to do that's fun to do sometimes

428
01:03:54,519 --> 01:04:08,409
i'm all about like hypotheticals and stuff it's fun you would never let yourself cry in front of

429
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:22,309
others no i've i've done it in front of you i've literally cried on this stream like twice you've

430
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:31,929
seen me cry twice for very different reasons by the way you feel more drawn to places with

431
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:41,980
a bustling and busy atmosphere than quiet and intimate ones yeah lash vegas come on you like

432
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,300
discussing different views and theories on what the world could look like in the future oh yeah

433
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:53,820
you know is a robot's gonna take over we've had these conversations over the stream what's gonna

434
01:04:53,820 --> 01:05:00,409
happen in 500 years are they gonna write books about this yeah all the time when it comes to

435
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:06,309
making life-changing choices you mostly listen to your heart rather than your head yeah sometimes

436
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:22,099
yeah yeah you cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you

437
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:34,650
cannot see touch or experience probably probably because i would get i would get lost i'd get lost

438
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:50,650
yeah that i'll get lost comedy oh wait i thought they were talking about like oh yeah you're right

439
01:05:50,650 --> 01:06:00,389
okay but is that comedy that that's something there's no study of comedy oh what are you what

440
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:08,420
are you doing in college oh i'm a comedyologist that no you just kind of you don't like study

441
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:24,730
dedicating your life to the study of something you can experience comedy yeah but experiences at the

442
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:31,369
end that you cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you

443
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:38,329
cannot see touch or experience i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go with this group because

444
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:52,570
i guess like comedy is like a thing i guess right there's no or here it's not the study of

445
01:06:52,570 --> 01:07:01,420
or the experience of it's just the study of it's very clearly not meant as comedy yeah it is it's

446
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:08,329
like it's like what they're talking about here is they're talking about like religion and that's

447
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:25,289
mainly i'm assuming what they mean by this yeah what about physics particle physics yeah but the

448
01:07:25,289 --> 01:07:31,579
particles exist okay you usually prefer to get your i thought that said massage you usually

449
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:36,699
prefer to get a massage rather than i'm like wait what usually prefer to get your revenge rather

450
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:50,099
than to forgive i've never like had to get i've never like had like revenge though before

451
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:13,300
revenge when have i ever had to get like revenge like maybe in like a video game world no i don't

452
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:19,420
know you make decisions on a whim all the time the time you spend by yourself often ends up being

453
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,739
more interesting and satisfying than the time you spend with other people it really depends but for

454
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:32,840
the most part no somewhere in here you often put social special effort into interpreting the real

455
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:43,479
meaning or the message of a song or a movie hmm that's tough i don't really think i do that

456
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:51,880
though no because every time i watch a movie that confuses me i just find the subreddit that the

457
01:08:51,880 --> 01:09:06,260
movie is based on and read ending explained what did mean when explained and i just look at

458
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,579
somebody on reddit has like two paragraphs that explains literally everything you ever want you

459
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:18,739
go oh yeah okay cool so i don't like sit in a chair and have like a pipe in my mouth just sitting

460
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:25,399
there like hmm what happened in that tv show no somebody else will tell me no i don't

461
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:32,409
he trusts reddit no i'm just saying like it's somebody else like already somebody else already

462
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:37,609
has this is the thing about the internet and pretty much this is how it works somebody on

463
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:42,819
the internet figured it out already if this is something that you think that like hey wait

464
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:46,899
hold on is that what is that what's what happened in that movie i think no no somebody already

465
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:52,020
figured it out there are people that figured out the end of like every tv show and every like movie

466
01:09:52,100 --> 01:10:00,760
in every book like years before they were even done so they already they said somebody else has

467
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,649
already figured it out that's why i just don't even use the internet if you're ever going to

468
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:09,699
watch a movie just don't go on the internet you always know exactly what you want no i don't

469
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:13,460
you rarely think back on the choices you made you rarely think back on the choices you made

470
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:19,779
and wonder what you could have done differently rarely look back so like i don't typically look

471
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:26,069
back and see what i could have done no i do i do you always try to figure out like uh it would

472
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:37,289
no i can't pick the middle one because this website hates me no i don't that often maybe

473
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:46,119
like once in a while no no i don't i usually just kind of stick with whatever happens

474
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:54,739
yeah i do when in a public place you usually stick to quieter and less crowded areas

475
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:02,470
no i usually like the hustle and bustle you tend to focus on present realities rather than future

476
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:09,989
possibilities no i'm always trying to think of like what cool thing could i try or do in the

477
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:19,140
future you often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings no when starting to work

478
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:39,109
on a project you prefer to make as many decisions upfront as possible some it really depends on what

479
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:49,880
they what what the thing is though no i do when you know someone thinks highly of you i mean like

480
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,920
all of you everyone here you also wonder how long it will be until they become disappointed in you

481
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:10,470
we actually talked about this like two days ago i don't give a shit about what people think about

482
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:17,479
me i give a shit what everybody thinks about me about flippy floppy no but that's different

483
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:23,180
though that's different because i thought when you know someone thinks highly of you this is

484
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:27,819
not flippy floppy because when this is a word differently when you know that somebody thinks

485
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:33,050
highly of you you also wonder how long it'll be maybe if the big yeah no that absolutely

486
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:37,609
because you want you want to make sure that they still think you're like cool they still like you

487
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:43,109
that they still happen like a good time yeah you feel comfortable just walking up to someone you

488
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:49,989
find interesting and striking a conversation no i don't here's the thing about walking up to

489
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:55,859
somebody and like starting a conversation everybody has this thing in their head of the conversation

490
01:12:55,859 --> 01:13:02,340
that they're gonna have and it's usually the first like three sentences everybody blocks out the

491
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,060
first like two or three sentences and then after you have your pre-planned like two sentences that

492
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:17,449
you're gonna say uh-oh there's nothing else here um so like for instance right like oh hey you

493
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:22,569
notice that oh somebody's somebody likes garbanzo beans at the grocery store i love garbanzo beans

494
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:26,170
hey i love garbanzo beans those are really delicious here's like i got an interesting

495
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:31,689
recipe for like hummus that you could try okay cool hey uh those that's the best brand i usually

497
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:53,300
that got my grandmother passed down to me okay i gotta go bye what do you do like everyone has

498
01:13:53,300 --> 01:14:08,090
the two sentences ready okay let's go no i do not you often drift away to daydreaming but very oh

499
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:28,760
yeah you look after yourself first and others come in second hmm there's a reason yeah secure

500
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:41,909
your own oxygen mask first before helping others i just read that somewhere probably on reddit

501
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:56,170
no you can all right for me listen listen for me to be able to look after somebody else

502
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:01,529
i need to be capable of doing that i have to be kind of in the right mindset i've got to be

503
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:06,970
in a good spot i gotta be okay with me before i can be okay telling somebody else what to do

504
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:18,220
you know what i mean take care of yourself first make sure you are good because how can you expect

505
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:27,260
to like take care of somebody else if you're not kind of locked in on yourself you know what

506
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:30,380
i'm saying like think about that put your own oxygen mask on first got that on reddit

507
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:38,220
even when you have planned a particular daily routine you usually just end up doing what you

508
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:50,680
feel like at any given moment yeah self-absorbed streamer steals oxygen masks and claims they

552
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:43,079
minutes yeah i can go all over the place you often contemplate the reasons for human existence and

553
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:51,050
the meaning of life no that's too much to think about once you start thinking about that shit

554

you start to you go down like the path and you're just like wait a minute what the fuck is this why

560
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:55,260
to pretend like i know why maybe sometimes we're almost done you have got detailed you have got

561
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:00,300
detailed education or career development plans stretching several years into the future

564
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:40,180
know vpn keeps keeping us at like pretty decent frame drops uh we'll keep using it you rarely

565
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:47,689
dwell on your regrets no like i told you before you gotta you grow spending time in a dynamic

566
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:51,369
atmosphere with lots of people around quickly makes you feel drained and in need of a getaway

567
01:23:52,569 --> 01:24:04,649
i like going out with people you see yourself as more of a realist than a visionary it's like that

568
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:10,390
you know what i mean like if my if your brains are all in here my brain's in here but like it

569
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:20,619
occupies like this that's not saying i'm smart that's saying that whatever like like low iq

570
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:25,739
idiocy that's in here is not like densely packed into the brain it's like up like as an aura around

571
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:32,779
like all over here i got a pretty decent iq though you've already proved that you find it easy to

572
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:44,279
empathize with the person who has gone through something you never have that's hard to do you

573
01:24:44,279 --> 01:25:00,649
like to try you like to try i wouldn't say that's i i disagree that much on that because everybody

574
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:08,329
has such different experiences you know if you have an experience and i have an experience and

575
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:15,289
it's completely different like the common ground is you know something you have to reach kim's

576
01:25:15,289 --> 01:25:24,729
calling me out right now hey wait wait wait why why is kim personality doxing me right now

577
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:47,909
what do you mean i'm a realist a realist a realist okay a realist would have probably

578
01:25:49,300 --> 01:26:07,850
a realist probably would have gotten like a job eight years ago i'm not a realtor kim called you

579
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:20,039
a bb that's not a guys that's not a personality thing that's like a like a cute terminology

580
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:26,279
that's not like a personality type she calls you a bb oh yeah i'm a what are you a realist

581
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:36,710
a visionary or a bb which one of these things are you no i'm a fucking visionary okay your

582
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:42,789
personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy yes than to organize consistent

583
01:26:42,789 --> 01:26:49,909
efforts first bursts of random energy that's why sometimes i don't stream i don't have a schedule

584
01:26:49,909 --> 01:27:00,489
right so like sometimes i it's like oh today i'm today i'm ready right let's go your emotions

617
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:04,520
look like this start reading hey all right introduction i don't want to read all this

618
01:32:05,239 --> 01:32:12,939
hold on let's just get the tldr the campaigner personality is a true free spirit they're often

619
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:20,760
the life of the party but unlike types in the explorer role group campaigners are less interested

620
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,840
in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in the enjoying the social and

621
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:32,039
emotional connections they make with others charming independent energetic and compassionate

622
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:35,720
the seven percent of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd

623
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:45,909
i am in the top seven percent of people right this is astrology why are they minecraft characters

624
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:55,000
you can change the world with just an idea more than just sociable people pleasers though campaigners

625
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:01,270
like all their diplomat cousins i'm a diplomat should i run for office hold on let's read let's

626

read the thing let's read like the part of the ign article that like everyone just reads and then

627
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:13,270
scrolls to the end let's see what the score is uh campaigners are fiercely independent and much

628
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:25,260
more than stability and security they crave creativity and freedom yeah don't lose that

629
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:37,060
little spark of madness wait what do you mean madness it's all right the care the campaigner

630
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:43,539
personality type needs to be careful however if they rely too much on their intuition assume or

631
01:33:43,539 --> 01:33:48,659
anticipate too much about a friend's motivations they can misread the signals and frustrate plans

632
01:33:48,659 --> 01:33:54,100
that a more straightforward approach would have made simple this kind of social stress is the

633
01:33:54,100 --> 01:34:00,739
bug bear that keeps harmony focused diplomats awake at night campaigners are very emotional

634
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:11,260
and sensitive and when they step on someone's toes they both feel it what's a bug bear all right

examine the personality characteristics and emotional functioning of their patients

678
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:45,289
this test is often employed in diagnosing underlying thought disorders and differentiating

679
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:50,329
psychotic from non-psychotic thinking in cases where the patient is reluctant to openly admit

756
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:32,500
a tootsie roll tastes the way that an empty nesquik container smells let's go up here and

757
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:39,859
butterfingers are too hard to eat when you bite into a butterfinger it just like gets all of your

758
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:51,880
teeth you have to sit there and go like all day they taste really good but you have to go into

759
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:57,399
every single crevice of all of your molars with like a pickaxe even if you brush your teeth a

760
02:01:57,399 --> 02:02:04,630
butterfinger is still there i have an electric toothbrush that goes at like 500 milliseconds of

761
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:15,510
a minute whatever it's like and i it doesn't work i've eaten a butterfinger before and done

762
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:22,229
my super toothbrush and there's still like deposits of fucking butterfinger gold in my teeth

763
02:02:22,949 --> 02:02:35,239
they still taste good but you can't i don't like to eat them all the sour shit goes down somewhere

764
02:02:35,239 --> 02:02:47,180
at the bottom for me sour patch kids airheads may even be made out of plastic i don't know what

765
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:55,899
are they made out of once you okay there's like chocolate caramel and then this could be plastic

766
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:18,920
i like nerds though kitkats we'll fix this jolly ranchers are oh they're okay but i don't know

767
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:28,539
they fit in that weird category of you don't you can't have more than one and plus you can always

768
02:03:28,539 --> 02:03:35,850
tell when somebody has a jolly rancher in their mouth because you can hear it it's how do i do

769
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:44,470
this without putting something gross in my mouth it's like you i can't how do i do this how do i

770
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:50,699
i was gonna put a coin in my mouth but i have not cleaned those coins actually i got it this is what

771
02:03:50,699 --> 02:04:17,960
it's like when somebody's eating a jolly rancher what's up i don't like it but i'm sorry bottom

772
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:33,100
tier both almond joy and whiz mounds not very good i just did not very good i can't i don't

773
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:38,939
really love it you guys always talk shit about boomers this is the ultimate i'm a boomer and

774
02:04:38,939 --> 02:04:50,439
here's the thing i like to eat this is the boomer candy it is it no that is that is it just is you

775
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:54,199
can like it but like my grandfather probably thinks this is great but i don't really like it

776
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:09,079
i can't place these yet snow caps are kind of gross what was the last time you even had a snow

777
02:05:09,079 --> 02:05:18,020
cap i think the last time i had a snow cap i think i was watching toy story 2 in the movie theater

778
02:05:18,659 --> 02:05:30,220
this is the last time i ate one oh what are these dairy milk spree fun dip

779
02:05:30,779 --> 02:05:46,119
it's pez why are there two skittles no not naturally crunch is pretty good i'm not sure

780
02:05:46,119 --> 02:05:55,340
i would put it above like Reese's Pieces though pez's shit yeah tell you tell me pez's shit

781
02:05:56,300 --> 02:06:03,819
when you know that pez is like Campbell's soup you could literally eat it forever it doesn't

782
02:06:03,819 --> 02:06:09,750
ever go bad does it am i making that up i made that up i don't know i might have just made that

783
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:23,270
up i don't like i'm not a it's all right i'll say the the snickers bar is not very good to me

784
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:38,020
but the mini snickers the mini little ones are up here so i'm gonna average that out

785
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:43,689
Cadbury eggs are down here it's too heavy better than sweet tarts it's the same thing it's not the

786
02:06:43,689 --> 02:06:48,630
same thing it's completely different they they both have different textures they're just different

787
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:55,590
it's different because when you bite down on a snickers you bite through and there's the only

788
02:06:55,590 --> 02:07:00,710
one end of the chocolate you get when you have a mini snickers you get all four corners of the

789
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:12,260
chocolate it encompasses it surrounds the whole bar it's better it just is you get four corners

790
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:17,939
of the coated chocolate on a mini snickers big snickers bite through one of those ends is like

791
02:07:17,939 --> 02:07:24,949
peanuts and gravy whatever it is uh it's that's not the same somebody just said negative iq

792
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:35,859
some of you guys understand what i'm saying here you do Mike and Ike's that's D

793
02:07:44,069 --> 02:07:55,210
these are disgusting i it's cinnamon i don't like this it's what it is it's just cinnamon 3.0

794
02:07:57,380 --> 02:08:03,380
all the fireball is is just like this weird overly spiced latte cinnamon shit

795
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:09,479
i don't like it plus people drink this stuff as alcohol and it's i've had it makes me sick

796
02:08:10,199 --> 02:08:27,460
what are these gumballs oh sprees sprees are the little chewy i gotta get this right right

797
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:31,939
sprees are the little chewy uh discs that have that really sour fruity kind of taste

798
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:42,979
i'm gonna make sure i get this right yes okay they go they go up here they have a little chewy

799
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:51,050
discs they remind me of mentos the fruit ones the fruit mentos but like a way better version of the

800
02:08:51,050 --> 02:09:05,239
fruit mentos where why are fruit mentos not on here it's strange candy corn just should never

801
02:09:05,239 --> 02:09:10,439
be eaten it's a decoration i wouldn't put a decoration in my mouth so why would i put that

802
02:09:10,439 --> 02:09:17,460
in my mouth i'm actually kind of upset that one of my favorite candies is where's um where's three

803
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:25,739
musketeers three musketeers are one of my absolute favorite candies it would be up here

804
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:41,369
this is bullshit can i pretend one of these is three musketeers it's in the trash no it's not

805
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:49,779
lemon heads they're i don't they're on the same tier as like jolly ranchers and airheads that's

806
02:09:49,779 --> 02:10:04,649
that same theory there are two pockies pixie sticks gross well hershey's kisses

807
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:24,329
huh hershey's kisses are actually kind of good but but they that good no these are warheads

808
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:33,989
the sour cave never had warhead before um i would put warheads up at s tier but you honestly only

809
02:10:33,989 --> 02:10:39,989
eat one of these once every few years and you go oh wow that was crazy but that sucked i don't want

810
02:10:39,989 --> 02:10:47,689
to do that again but you have this weird memory that you liked them i have a memory right now of

811
02:10:47,689 --> 02:10:53,420
those being s tier but they're not at all they're just they're horrible why is it that every time

812
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:58,220
you see this at the store you go oh warheads oh cool man warheads and you buy them and you

813
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:05,529
fucking hate them every time so like in your mind they're up here but in reality they're probably

814
02:11:05,529 --> 02:11:20,119
down here and that's a chad candy it's because of nostalgia nostalgia nostalgia am i saying that

815
02:11:20,119 --> 02:11:30,739
word right nostalgia am i saying that correct why does it sound weird saying that no nostalgia

816
02:11:31,479 --> 02:11:39,750
nostalgia that sounds odd now i can't say it anymore i don't like i mean pocky is

817
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:44,069
and i have only had it a few times but it's just like oh it's okay it's like i wouldn't choose it

818
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:57,779
it's better than warheads though it's probably it's better than butterfingers it is this is not

819
02:11:57,779 --> 02:12:02,979
final just this is hope everyone's freaking out this is not a final list this is a general idea

820
02:12:03,939 --> 02:12:14,550
and then we go from here dots okay dots are the equivalent to me of finding gum under a seat

821
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:31,140
sorry they're always okay why is it that dots are always seem to be stale

822
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:37,739
their dots are the stale bread of the candy world you put one in your mouth and it's like

823
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:42,789
took a little while to go through it almost feels like it gave you way too much give

824
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:52,149
it's not soft not a fan i also am going to make people pissed off here i really hate

825
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:59,619
twizzlers i think that they don't taste like anything it's just like it doesn't it i it's

826
02:12:59,619 --> 02:13:07,800
like that weird taste it doesn't it doesn't do anything for me they taste like artificial

827
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:15,380
like i don't know how let me try to describe this i'll get it hold on let me use my visionary brain

828
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:24,279
um twizzlers are like the only thing that's fun to do with a twizzler i got it it's in my brain

829
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:31,399
i'm pulling it out somebody get like the fucking wand when you bite off both ends of a twizzler

830
02:13:31,399 --> 02:13:36,279
and then you stick that into a drink and you drink up the drink with the hole in the twizzler

831
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:50,729
that's it there's no other reason to eat them in my opinion they're just chewy gamey it's okay

832
02:13:50,729 --> 02:13:58,060
twizzlers are like the lamb of the kingdom that means it would be not that's way off it's like

833
02:13:58,060 --> 02:14:07,800
chewy and gamey and i can't describe it you know what i mean they're not they're not good m&m's

834
02:14:10,569 --> 02:14:14,890
nobody want nobody orders m&m's i'm doing this based on like if i was at a candy store what would

835
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:32,100
i get there are m&m's everywhere there are too many m&m's m&m's are the ant of the candy animal

836
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:40,659
they're just everywhere why am i doing these like weird analogies here there's so many m&m's

837
02:14:42,359 --> 02:14:59,159
there are more m&m's than people on earth yeah i think that's true they're better than swedish

838
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:05,079
fish i feel the same way swedish fish and twizzlers are the same kind of flavor profile

839
02:15:05,079 --> 02:15:13,909
for me and these also swedish fish also you open a bag and sometimes they just taste like stale

840
02:15:13,909 --> 02:15:19,159
it's hard to like you you have to eat the whole bag in the first day i do they taste stale they

841
02:15:19,159 --> 02:15:27,479
think hard to bite through i can't be the only person that thinks this i can't be crispy m&m's

842
02:15:27,479 --> 02:15:33,579
are s tier uh peanut butter m&m's are way up here but regular m&m's are not i don't think

843
02:15:38,659 --> 02:15:46,810
i'm beyond wrong uh laffy taffy if this was saltwater can i pretend this is something else

844
02:15:48,119 --> 02:15:51,720
because i have to tell you my s tier candy can i pretend these are something else

845
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:58,779
no can i how can i how do i pretend let me just pretend these are something else

846
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:09,689
saltwater taffy is is s tier is the best candy ever nice soft delicious saltwater taffy is s

847
02:16:11,369 --> 02:16:14,729
so but can i pretend that's what that is i don't want laffy taffy that's like the

848
02:16:14,729 --> 02:16:23,689
fucking joke brand add images well i don't have an image of saltwater taffy i'm like

849
02:16:23,689 --> 02:16:41,100
it's not my desktop background i don't like uh wafers either here's another one that you only

850
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:55,719
eat at a movie theater then they have that kind of they have that malty taste to them don't they

851
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:13,000
what is that i don't is that that weird like coated sour straw stuff double bubble

852
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:24,250
it's going up here i remember if you were like really good in class a teacher of mine would give

853
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:32,629
a double bubble you got like an a on a test there you go there's a double bubble for you

854
02:17:34,409 --> 02:17:42,940
all gum is what it tastes good for one second better than bubble tape bubble tape is down here

855
02:17:43,579 --> 02:17:59,340
double bubble is better than bubble tape look bubble look at look bubble tape oh i'm so old

856
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:15,430
bubble tape is old too that's boomer gum bubble tape is old they ran an entire commercial campaign

857
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:21,059
guys 20 years ago about how bubble tape was not supposed to be eaten by old people they did a

858
02:18:21,059 --> 02:18:26,899
whole ad campaign with it was like the same like old librarian looking lady that would like be

859
02:18:26,899 --> 02:18:31,620
going like dish into the camera and stuff and it was like skateboards and it's for you not them

years ago just wait better than pes i've just let me get these up here the rest of these are

862

863
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:26,659

876
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:41,479
but they're not because they hurt lifesavers do this thing where after they're one of them's

877
02:21:41,479 --> 02:21:46,579
in your mouth for more than um like 10 minutes or so and it gets to be really thin it starts

878
02:21:46,579 --> 02:21:54,500
to become a knife that like pierces you and stabs you they don't dissolve fast enough they just

879
02:21:54,500 --> 02:22:02,100
turn into weapons in your mouth and then if it gets to that point where you were oh this is

880
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:07,780
getting really kind of small now i need to break it it's like biting on glass and you like have

881
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:15,860
to be real careful they're good though they have a good flavor i would probably rather have a

882
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:32,520
lifesaver than a skittle what is this uh haribo i don't like gummy bears i wouldn't put these

893
02:24:06,579 --> 02:24:15,110
coca-cola of gummy bears right if you go into a candy store and they have like a local kind

coca-cola kind of pepsi of gummy bears that's that's real right there are a lot of candy shops

896
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:33,450

i've had gummy bears before that were like oh those are fucking really really good

898
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:50,280

930
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:31,930
i got it i got it i got it maybe it would be funny like to have a scenario where like

931
02:30:32,569 --> 02:30:49,059
i just leave stop stop stop stop saying that stop that this is a this is a this is a a pg 13

932
02:30:49,059 --> 02:30:55,899
slightly towards our stream that's not we don't do talk about that on here whatever my she's like

933
02:30:55,899 --> 02:31:00,219
brushing my hair well like just imagine my scenario you know what i mean i'm just like

934
02:31:00,219 --> 02:31:05,260
doing a tier list about fucking candy and like my girlfriend's brushing my hair and i'm just like

935
02:31:06,219 --> 02:31:29,500
what's happening i'm very easily distracted okay where were we oh yeah okay i'm they're gonna get

936
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:39,909
back on track here ring but where's ring pops there's a rossum where where are they somebody

937
02:31:39,909 --> 02:31:56,090
said ring pops are trash no they're not what's wrong with the ring pop i think i would rather

938
02:31:56,090 --> 02:32:01,370
have a ring pop than like a cadbury egg in fact yeah i don't know why they're up here this high

939
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:07,819
there's no right way to eat a cadbury egg and i'm not talking about like the racy campaign where

940
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:13,500
there's no wrong way to eat a rices there's no way to eat a cadbury egg if you bite into a

941
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:18,700
cadbury egg it's it like goes all over your mouth and all over your pants and shit if you put the

942
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:22,940
whole thing in your mouth at once it chokes you because it's too much you can't there's no way

943
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:34,969
to eat a cadbury egg that should be their campaign just swallow it whole just like that would hurt so

944
02:32:34,969 --> 02:32:45,670
bad uh yeah i would put them underneath here all right probably below butterfinger too i don't think

945
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:52,090
i've ever i've never i don't think i've had these aren't these the same things as uh whoppers fun

946
02:32:52,090 --> 02:33:02,280
facts our patch kids are s plus no they start to they start to hurt they start i determine if i

947
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:08,840
like a candy or not based on how many i can eat in a row before it makes me sick that sounds

948
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:16,969
fucked up it does but um i mean like how many can i eat in a row before i like start to not i hate

949
02:33:16,969 --> 02:33:25,049
them and while a sour patch kid or a swedish fish may taste very very good after eight of them

950
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:35,100
you start to feel like shit i could eat like a two or three bars of twix if i eat like eight

951
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:41,899
to ten swedish fish they start to turn and cement themselves into one giant swedish fish ball

952
02:33:41,899 --> 02:33:47,899
that sits down here like in your like down at the bottom of your esophagus it just it turns

953
02:33:47,899 --> 02:33:55,659
into like a ball like bubble tape i don't know why people like this so much or even like this

954
02:33:55,659 --> 02:34:01,180
is like a little bit different but bubble tape when you eat the whole roll you feel like terrible

955
02:34:01,180 --> 02:34:05,579
afterwards it's like that chewy candy when you and you're supposed to like chew it and swallow

956
02:34:05,579 --> 02:34:09,500
they got like a like a fruit by the foot when you eat that whole thing it's stuck if you feel

957
02:34:09,579 --> 02:34:15,799
horrible i think there was one time i ate a whole thing of bubble tape and i was watching a movie

958
02:34:15,799 --> 02:34:34,469
and i like almost shit my pants that's like eating a whole pack of gum it is a whole that's like five

959
02:34:34,469 --> 02:34:47,239
packs of gum what was the movie toy story one all right everlasting gobstopper i'm not sure i've ever

960
02:34:47,239 --> 02:34:54,940
had these really to be honest no i have they're like in that same category of like this kind of

961
02:34:55,020 --> 02:35:02,389
shit it's like a jawbreaker this is just like a milk chocolate bar but they're oh they're good

962
02:35:02,389 --> 02:35:12,280
i've had them before better than the eggs um oh this is the youtube surprise eggs i'm putting

967
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:57,350
to put little swallowable toys in food why would you do that is it like what do you like eat around

968
02:35:57,350 --> 02:36:07,209
it do you break it in half or like what they aren't even in the food they're not i thought

969
02:36:07,209 --> 02:36:15,819
it was like you isn't it like inside of the the food there is the little toy only americans

970
02:36:15,819 --> 02:36:29,049
are dumb enough to eat those i what about like kids what about like little kids how would they

971
02:36:29,049 --> 02:36:37,159
know see like do you are you supposed to just break it in half take the thing out and like

972
02:36:37,159 --> 02:36:41,959
then eat the chocolate i would just put it in my mouth and like that would be like the coolest

973
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:46,280
surprise is like put the whole thing in your mouth without opening it and then like let the chocolate

974
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:49,319
melt around you while you move it around and try to figure out what it is before you take it out

975
02:36:49,319 --> 02:36:58,120
of your mouth isn't that how you do it it's like oh i wonder what this is let me see uh it's a bike

976
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:08,149
right then you take it out and see if it's a bike they're inside of a container it's in a plastic

977
02:37:08,149 --> 02:37:23,909
capsule i've never had one moving on i don't know what these are um are these the the chewy um

978
02:37:23,909 --> 02:37:36,969
version of the jolly rancher what are those they've flavored tootsie rolls oh they're the fruit

979
02:37:36,969 --> 02:37:44,379
tootsie rolls i've had these before i don't know where they stand are these um are these now and

980
02:37:44,379 --> 02:37:51,659
later's uh i would put now and later's up here if every time i ate them i was not in fear of

981
02:37:51,659 --> 02:38:01,909
ripping all of my teeth out of my jaw i've had scary moments before when i put a now and later

982
02:38:01,909 --> 02:38:09,190
in my mouth and gone down a little too hard and it it's stuck here and i'm not going to get it

983
02:38:09,190 --> 02:38:15,350
off without actually hurting myself sometimes if you do those situations where you bite down a

984
02:38:15,350 --> 02:38:19,750
little too hard on now and later and you go well this is it i'm uh this is my i'm stuck here forever

985
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:26,600
now this is my life and you have to sit there like what do i do and then you do you like a

986
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:32,360
construction worker you like start to like get leverage around a molar and sit there and hold

987
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:58,389
and slow it too many bad memories it tastes good though please check hair we're good ow i can't

992
02:39:54,389 --> 02:40:00,629
to put this is three musketeers the rest of these these are i don't know i don't know i don't think

993
02:40:00,629 --> 02:40:09,049
i've ever had this before doesn't belong in the trash but i never had it an arrow arrow have i ever

994
02:40:09,049 --> 02:40:24,549

995
02:40:24,549 --> 02:40:33,930
that are really soft and fluffy they you bite into them they're very fluffy and very like

996
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:48,309
puffy and chewy this is good this is really good oh man am i remember okay and they look like a shoe

997
02:40:48,309 --> 02:40:53,930
right they're like they're like weirdly shaped they almost look like um like circus peanuts

998
02:40:53,930 --> 02:41:06,629
do they have to okay do they have the consistency of a circus peanut do that they do they do do they

999
02:41:06,629 --> 02:41:12,309
have the consistency of a circus peanut and no no no no guys guys guys guys not not a peanut that

1000
02:41:12,309 --> 02:41:19,350
you get at the circus this the orange circus peanut candy that exact that texture that like

1001
02:41:20,149 --> 02:41:32,729
chewy but fluffy circus peanut soft texture no people are getting really confused there is a

1002
02:41:32,729 --> 02:41:37,450
candy that is as old as time they were eating it in like the bible it's just called the circus

1003
02:41:37,450 --> 02:41:49,079
peanut they're bright orange soft chewy candy we know no but some people were telling me i that

1004
02:41:49,079 --> 02:41:55,500
they don't know okay so i'm wrong so i've done that maybe i never had them before i don't know

1005
02:41:55,500 --> 02:42:16,600
where they go i there has to be another tier these are bubble gums air bubble chocolate

1006
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:22,299
i don't think i've ever had them but i feel like i have this is this is a another country right

1007
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:29,620
all right settle down i'm ready to make my final decisions here this is three musketeers by the

1008
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:48,870
way it belongs up there Reese's now if this was a Reese's egg it would go up here it's not if this

1009
02:42:48,870 --> 02:43:02,709
is the Reese's eggs the best it's not a Reese's egg i'm gonna have this go base Reese uh spree

1010
02:43:03,430 --> 02:43:07,989
definitely belongs up here as well three musketeers up there double bubble belongs maybe

1011
02:43:07,989 --> 02:43:15,110
up here dum dums they're gonna replace double bubble every moment i look at double bubble i'm

1012
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:24,889
remembering the the dust that's around on it when you take a double bubble out it's covered in like

1013
02:43:24,889 --> 02:43:36,180
this weird dust like this white powder is all over it drop that's gonna have to drop it a few

1014
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:46,870
points i'd rather have a twix i'd rather have a dumb dumb than a runt i'd rather have a twix

1015
02:43:46,870 --> 02:43:54,180
than a Reese's pc starburst have kind of fallen off for me uh recently so i'd i'd rather kitkats

1016
02:43:54,180 --> 02:44:01,590
probably up here in front everybody loves kitkats come on they like the best in fact i think that's

1017
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:09,239
fair i'd rather have a kitkat than a spree i'd rather have a spree than a dumb dumb rather than

1018
02:44:09,239 --> 02:44:17,299
have a dumb dumb than a run okay twix yeah nestle crunch you get sick of this after a little while

1019
02:44:17,299 --> 02:44:23,020
though i could i could probably eat half of this bar and it would be a b-tier the other half of

1020
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:34,420
that bar is probably somewhere down here okay i'd rather have starburst than nerds that dust is

1021
02:44:34,420 --> 02:44:54,420
fucking with me right now okay snickers no i don't not a big fan sweethearts are really good

1022
02:44:55,219 --> 02:45:02,260
mr goodbar is pretty good skittles are probably better than sweethearts no they're not what a lie

1023
02:45:03,059 --> 02:45:16,579
pocky is here twice um i can't get rid of it so just pretend that's up here fun dip and pez

1024
02:45:16,579 --> 02:45:25,559
ring pops are way better than fun dip milky way is better than fun dip and pez jolly rancher is

1025
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:35,930
above that but well i just i don't chew gum anymore not really sweethearts are better than

1026
02:45:35,930 --> 02:46:00,920
dust gum are they are they though but okay when you unwrap a double bubble if you never had it

1027
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:03,559
before just close your eyes and imagine this and those of you that haven't had it before

1028
02:46:03,559 --> 02:46:06,040
close your eyes and also imagine this because we're going to take this journey together

1029
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:13,209
that when you put it you unwrap it's covered in like the gum cheeto dust you put it in your mouth

1030
02:46:13,850 --> 02:46:23,700
and that first two bites is like the first two bites of a double bubble i think trumps

1031
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:39,639
everything down here did you experience it with me yeah like the first minute or two a double

1032
02:46:39,639 --> 02:46:45,530
but it's like um what's what's that zebra gum with all like the food dye and coloring and flavors in

1033
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:55,379
it that you chew it for five seconds stripes yeah i would put stripes up here stripes would be above

1034
02:46:55,700 --> 02:47:04,360
would be up here because that there is a flavor that stripes gum has a flavor that has never been

1035
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:14,069
replicated before it has this taste that you will never have again it doesn't taste like something

1036
02:47:14,069 --> 02:47:23,209
it doesn't remind you of something it just is what it is and it's it can't be fucking replicated

1037
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:36,040
stripes gum was awesome skittles kind of have that same weird textural flavor to them

1038
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:42,260
we're slim gyms this is candy man slim gyms they're bad feeling like on snacks

1039
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:59,850
okay i'm getting uh sidetracked here those are gross uh ring pop and jolly rancher are like the

1040
02:47:59,850 --> 02:48:06,059
same thing for me but i would rather have a ring pop than a jolly rancher i'd rather have a jolly

1041
02:48:06,059 --> 02:48:10,790
rancher than a lifesaver i'd probably rather have a milky way than a good bar

1042
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:20,170
or a tootsie pop no that's not true to default i would rather have a milky way than a snickers

1043
02:48:20,170 --> 02:48:46,940
though no i i don't think so i think i'd rather choose these than pocky sweets hearts belong up

1044
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:55,540
here but does pez would i rather have a butterfinger or pez you got two people both on opposite

1045
02:48:55,540 --> 02:49:04,360
sides of the room hey dude do you want some pez yeah hey dude i got it you want some of my

1046
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:22,659
butterfinger which one do i want pez because i would like to use a dispenser it would be pez

1047
02:49:27,819 --> 02:49:35,290
all right that's good for me i think i'd rather have this milk chocolate bar than a pocky that's

1048
02:49:35,290 --> 02:49:42,299
what they say pocky isn't good pocky is good yeah good then i could just yeah yeah you get it you

1049
02:49:42,299 --> 02:49:48,090
get a pez for the toy then i could just run off with the toy you know oh hey thanks with pez and

1050
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:52,409
i like ripped a fucking head off and then start sprinting and then like give them you know that'd

1051
02:49:52,409 --> 02:50:03,059
be easy but pez tastes bad i actually don't i don't mind the taste of pez okay hair just fell

1052
02:50:03,059 --> 02:50:17,940
out no i don't hate pez i think i think that tastes good pez is another one of those things

1053
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:25,190
it has that flavor that cannot be replicated all right this is important i would rather have

1054
02:50:25,190 --> 02:50:33,780
these gummy bears than sour patch kids i would probably rather have a warhead

1055
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:47,479
i would eat the gummy bears over a butterfinger because it's really easy to be like oh i'll have

1056
02:50:47,479 --> 02:50:54,250
a few gummy bears you can't have a few butterfingers when you open it that's it and

1057
02:50:54,250 --> 02:51:02,020
they're huge butterfingers are too big i think i found the problem i i found the problem butterfingers

1058
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:09,350
are this big it's like holding a hammer if butterfingers were smaller by default you can

1059
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:16,840
get mini butterfingers but they're thick even the small mini butterfingers are really thick

1060
02:51:17,719 --> 02:51:23,319
if they were a little thinner do they make thin butterfingers that's not as much of like the

1061
02:51:23,319 --> 02:52:06,760
shaved ice that makes up the internal organ why is he in a cave what was i saying crispy

1062
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:16,280
butterfingers are great yeah but do they are they thin i would eat butterfingers if they were thin

1063
02:52:24,170 --> 02:52:35,049
add an echo to your voice oh my fucking god hold on guys let me eat i'm gonna eat my jolly rancher

1064
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:54,920
all right what am i doing oh an echo i can't i don't think i can even do that

1065
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:18,549
i don't think i can add an echo to this hold on can i wait wait wait i think i can hold on let me

1066
02:53:18,549 --> 02:53:25,750
add let me add an audio input it's gonna be the webcam and i'm gonna delay it by like a half a

1067
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:46,229
quarter of a second okay can you hear me can you guys hear me is it happening at the same time

1068
02:53:46,790 --> 02:54:05,219
all right here we go so i'm gonna delay this by like hello hello hello hello hello

1069
02:54:07,379 --> 02:54:29,700
hello no hold on this just became way more important hello hello hello hello

1070
02:54:30,659 --> 02:55:10,440
a little more more more how's that hello hello louder louder do it louder now i'm standing on a

1071
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:18,469
cliff how what's that how long wait a minute hold on a second i'm gonna try to scare the shit out

1072
02:55:18,469 --> 02:55:48,420
of myself hold on let me see if this is possible does this do anything hey did it work i'm gonna

1073
02:55:48,420 --> 02:56:09,639
try to jump scare myself i'm gonna monitor this hold on okay this is gonna come through

1074
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:29,430
all right you ready okay so what i want to do here is rices uh where do i want to put rices

1075
02:56:30,069 --> 02:57:08,379
how about put it up an s tier did it happen i don't think it happened wait hold on what is

1076
02:57:08,379 --> 02:57:40,100
10 000 milliseconds did it happen tell me if you hear it it's quiet when it happens is it hold on

1077
02:57:40,659 --> 02:57:48,180
this just became something that is way more important all right 50 000 milliseconds

1078
02:57:49,559 --> 02:58:02,420
i can't i can only do like 10 000 i think i can do i can do 50 okay 30 000 milliseconds no

1079
02:58:02,420 --> 02:58:13,340
i can do 29 000 no i can do 20 000 milliseconds that's as much as i can do all right here we go

1080
02:58:13,979 --> 02:58:18,780
that's the highest i can go is 20 000 let me i'm gonna i'm gonna scare the shit out of you guys

1081
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:23,739
you ready what if i mute here and then it just happens at some point that'll work right

1082
02:58:36,659 --> 02:58:47,420
okay so i'm thinking haribo should probably go up a tier what do you think something like

1083
02:58:48,299 --> 02:59:10,969
five uh percentage points up it didn't work it should happen again wait did it do it twice

1084
02:59:18,139 --> 03:00:02,819
it happened twice oh wait wait wait wait wait okay so i think that if nestle crunch is somewhere

1085
03:00:02,819 --> 03:00:10,340
over twits that would mean that sweet tart can have to then theoretically be around there too

1086
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:15,620
because they're both delicious they're both really good they both taste very well and i think that

1087
03:00:15,620 --> 03:00:49,379
they would be in a good did it did it did i did it work uh one more i think my favorite movie was

1088
03:00:49,379 --> 03:00:55,370
probably um i'm a big fan of toy story 3 was really good somebody asked in the chat i just

1089
03:00:55,370 --> 03:01:04,860
want to make sure that i got i answered it yeah story story three story four was okay too i

1090
03:01:04,860 --> 03:01:10,920
didn't i didn't i i liked it i think dots should probably go i don't know much what do you guys

1091
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:54,020
think not f i don't think it belongs in f i think my favorite movie was probably um i'm a big fan

1092
03:01:54,020 --> 03:01:57,459
of toy story 3 was really good somebody asked in the chat i just want to make sure that i got i

1093
03:01:57,459 --> 03:02:24,500
answered it yeah story story story 4 was okay too i didn't that sounds so fucked up like what the

1094
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:44,219
hell is going on over here what the fuck are we doing oh yeah i gotta turn this off i have

1095
03:02:44,219 --> 03:02:58,600
this it's okay it's no longer being captured get a soundboard to do this again all right i hold on i

1096
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:03,719
do one do one more but this time i'm gonna like break this microphone because it sounds so strange

1097
03:03:03,719 --> 03:03:16,100
hold on just give me a second last one and then we'll move on by the way i don't know how loud

1098
03:03:16,100 --> 03:04:02,389
this is going to be so just prepare yourself prepare yourself

1099
03:04:14,950 --> 03:04:25,129
tends to be a little overpowering for me i like it when it's a little uh milder it tastes

1100
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:37,940
good but no i don't think it's enough for um to have on a daily basis for your candy preferences

1101
03:04:58,629 --> 03:05:05,129
i live in the middle of this somebody asked why did you do pocky twice i want to hear it let me

1102
03:05:05,129 --> 03:05:16,120

1166
03:17:45,850 --> 03:17:51,579
rats are just you know rats are classic up in smoke ah it's kind of overstated i think a little

1167
03:17:51,579 --> 03:17:55,579
bit i wouldn't call it like complete complete total theory but it's like it's it's on its way up

1168
03:17:57,209 --> 03:18:03,850
pre-recorded i don't it's like on its way up caught his mic is like currently fun right now

1171
03:18:19,829 --> 03:18:23,750
here a little bit worma is like probably all the way down here didn't really do much with worma

1172
03:18:24,629 --> 03:18:32,340
germa's liar yeah uh the seagulls can't really ever get rid of the seagulls but i don't know i

1173
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:36,819

1174
03:18:36,819 --> 03:18:42,790
have these as subsounds anymore but they when they were active they were i would put them right

1175
03:18:42,790 --> 03:18:49,239
behind minus two plus two or it probably a little bit ahead of it what rapper and reddit what does

1176
03:18:49,239 --> 03:18:58,840
that mean i'm not sure what that means and then uh cheese it versus cheese nips up here is two

1184
03:19:53,979 --> 03:19:58,059

1189
03:20:43,129 --> 03:20:46,969
not as good as the kim check and pre-recorded is better than grill master and laughing about it is

1190
03:20:46,969 --> 03:20:54,040
grill master's probably better uh germa con this enough that's nonsense that's just a thing that

03:25:17,879 --> 03:25:43,299
okey dokey look at that better more controlled do i still have the comb in my hair no all right

1203
03:25:43,299 --> 03:25:59,290
uh let's get this off these are controllers so d i would just put do a beer tier list i don't drink

1204
03:25:59,290 --> 03:26:19,420
that much beer to have like a real opinion on it hold on come on get over there stop it all right

1205
03:26:19,420 --> 03:26:28,969
that's good uh so these these are video game controllers this is dirty whatever okay video

1206
03:26:28,969 --> 03:26:43,940
game controllers uh let's change this to let's put one let's put f down here new f change the

1207
03:26:43,940 --> 03:26:56,180
color too okay fuck that thing seriously that like one of us that was horrible i this thing was so

1208
03:26:56,180 --> 03:27:13,959
bad it was so bad sideways switch no you can't even hold it although what the hell what is this

1209
03:27:13,959 --> 03:27:24,469
chainsaw that's that's that's a collector's edition perk for buying a collector's edition

1210
03:27:24,469 --> 03:27:48,200
that's not a what is that no this hurts if you hold it too long super nintendo controller pretty

1211
03:27:48,200 --> 03:28:03,299
close to being perfect so is the n64 controller game cubes up there too i'll make a final decision

1212
03:28:03,299 --> 03:28:15,260
in a minute the default regular super nintendo control is at least a b this thing wasn't very

1213
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:34,229
good either this was this but get in the way with a wheel really the wee wheel is here that's why

1214
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:43,909
why are there spongebob controllers i wouldn't use these i mean well i'm not going to buy that

1215
03:28:43,909 --> 03:28:57,129
i wouldn't use it there's no i i wouldn't i wouldn't buy it can i just have another category

1216
03:28:57,129 --> 03:29:04,340
that's just like this is just clearly joke like nonsense category they're not bad but they're

1217
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:16,549
just like why i don't want them i don't want them yeah there's a new category below this is just

1218
03:29:16,549 --> 03:29:23,139
going to be just like the nonsense category at this i mean that these are not bad controllers

1219
03:29:23,139 --> 03:29:37,420
that just they're nonsense this is just a controller skin what is that is it n64

1220
03:29:38,219 --> 03:29:50,489
but is it is that a left-handed n64 controller well i don't understand is that like for

1221
03:29:51,209 --> 03:30:07,659
i don't i've never used it it looks a little crowded i would accidentally press like up on

1222
03:30:07,659 --> 03:30:14,549
the d-pad when i pressed air b i'm not sure i like that i never used it but i don't don't look

1223
03:30:14,549 --> 03:30:23,559
fun to me the dreamcast controller actually is pretty good it's pretty well made it had the big

1224
03:30:23,559 --> 03:30:34,459
slots the big divots in the back to really hold on to that you can just slide into this is a

1225
03:30:34,459 --> 03:30:40,760
comedy controller i don't think that this is also a comedy controller this is the dance dance

1226
03:30:40,760 --> 03:30:46,760
revolution pad before dance dance revolution so it's going to get f just because it was pretty

1227
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:58,229
it was pretty new for its time the wiimote and nunchuck i would put them up here they were

1228
03:30:58,790 --> 03:31:22,940
kind of fun and nice to use this is like a fishing pole what is that i i did what what is this for

1229
03:31:25,319 --> 03:31:48,020
this wu tang wait was there a wu tang console was there it's a collector's edition yeah but

1230
03:31:48,020 --> 03:31:56,600
that's what i mean it's not like a controller comes with a console the wiifit scale i'll put

1231
03:31:56,600 --> 03:32:06,219
it up here where it belongs and like oh it's right next to this is fun the steam control is

1232
03:32:06,219 --> 03:32:16,420
really not good this is the same as this just with different colored buttons so i mean i'm

1233
03:32:16,420 --> 03:32:35,590
gonna put that in nonsense this is just like the skittles version that's not this is just like a

1234
03:32:35,590 --> 03:32:43,129
peripheral it's not even a controller is this a keyboard like hold on like just a keyboard and

1235
03:32:43,209 --> 03:33:18,940
mouse for pc gaming i thought that's not that's not fair is it hold on what is this is it a mat

1236
03:33:19,579 --> 03:33:26,059
this looks like a beach towel is this another one of these like dance dance revolution maps or

1237
03:33:26,059 --> 03:33:43,239
something okay well that uh no the wiimote wiimote sideways was better than the switch sideways for

1238
03:33:43,239 --> 03:33:54,600
me it's bigger here's the dreamcast keyboard which this is just a nonsense collector's edition

1239
03:33:54,600 --> 03:34:03,479
controller i actually don't really like the ds's analog it was too thin for me it felt like it

1240
03:34:03,479 --> 03:34:12,600
could easily be worn down well this is a fishing pole like i said okay i can go over the that

1241
03:34:12,600 --> 03:34:24,600
fishing pole what if it is the best controller this is the pro controller right this thing's

1242
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:31,770
actually that's actually pretty good it's better than this one it's probably the game cube no it's

1243
03:34:31,770 --> 03:34:42,379
not which one of these was better it was this one's better yeah i wasn't actually a big fan of this

1244
03:34:42,379 --> 03:34:50,659
one this one actually feels better in your hands but this one actually bumps if you're trying to

1245
03:34:50,659 --> 03:35:01,340
you might bump it i remember you know it's it's pretty good um this is just a joke this is just

1246
03:35:01,340 --> 03:35:12,629
a skin so right this this looks like a piano is this a keyboard or is this a controller i don't

1247
03:35:12,629 --> 03:35:32,860
know what this is for what is this is this a gear shift on a car no this is no it's not all right

1248
03:35:32,860 --> 03:35:42,729
this is like revolutionary so that goes up here those are atari paddles this is just a skin

1249
03:35:43,860 --> 03:35:51,780
all right now we're getting to kind of current gen i really really really like the new dual shock

1250
03:35:51,780 --> 03:36:01,860
controller way more than i like the original i like how uh spread out it is i think this is actually

1251
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:08,840
way up here original xbox was a little too fat and chunky for me but it was definitely better

1252
03:36:08,840 --> 03:36:16,629
than this i actually i don't hate the xbox one controller but i do hate its annoyingly loud

1253
03:36:16,629 --> 03:36:41,270
bumpers the 360 controller might be up here i think so what else we got these are not very good

1254
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:52,729
the old sega genesis and sega they're very clunky three buttons it was just i didn't i don't really

1255
03:36:52,729 --> 03:36:58,059
like the playstation one controller either but it's definitely better than the dreamcast keyboard

1256
03:37:06,809 --> 03:37:16,010
in fact the ds controller is way better than the dreamcast keyboard this is not yeah i mean this

1257
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:34,760
thing is like what is this what the fuck even is this it's a boomerang controller i don't what is

1258
03:37:34,760 --> 03:37:41,139
that but that's your that's a sega uh the sega master system it really wasn't that good of a

1259
03:37:41,139 --> 03:37:49,860
controller though better than this it was really weird the whole thing was one button that's a

1260
03:37:49,940 --> 03:37:59,750
stovetop yeah you take this thing camping that's a stovetop that's pretty good that's really good

1261
03:38:00,760 --> 03:38:14,360
mod that guy this is just a joke this is a joke this is a cassette tape it's not even a controller

1262
03:38:16,139 --> 03:38:28,760
playstation camera i'll put them up here we'll deal with them later uh this this is the deal or

1263
03:38:28,760 --> 03:38:35,829
no deal pad i don't know what this is for this is yes or no button i don't think i think i would

1264
03:38:35,829 --> 03:38:49,930
use that it's just a peripheral this goes up here this this is just the evolved version of this

1265
03:38:49,930 --> 03:38:57,510
controller pokemon so i'm just gonna let's just put this up here i don't really like this one

1266
03:38:57,510 --> 03:39:16,500
though um fight sticks i don't really like fight sticks and then this is those are too many buttons

1267
03:39:20,069 --> 03:39:26,870
i don't know what you would do with that all right um so hold on the guitar hero is just it's a

1268
03:39:26,870 --> 03:39:33,510
peripheral it's not even a controller all right i gotta make a decision here what belongs where

1269
03:39:33,510 --> 03:40:27,450
what belongs up and what belongs down i know don't look at my zip it's done i do that that's the most

1270
03:40:27,450 --> 03:40:34,729
comfortable controller i think it is it has a nice weight to it the analogs feel very durable

1271
03:40:36,180 --> 03:40:43,739
the button placements the triggers are in a really good place i think it is the best controller

1272
03:40:43,739 --> 03:41:01,700
it's got really nice triggers it's got the lr l l1 and r1 i like it a lot the game cube is

1273
03:41:01,700 --> 03:41:17,959
really close if this is s this is like s minus but a plus i mean i don't have to move anything

1274
03:41:17,959 --> 03:41:25,379
i'm happy with this where's the xbox one controller that doesn't belong all the way down there

1275
03:41:36,280 --> 03:41:43,459
this does though i don't i they put the this is the wii u pro controller right they put the

1276
03:41:43,459 --> 03:41:49,459
right analog stick in a really fucking weird place up above on the top right shoulder

1277
03:41:50,260 --> 03:42:04,969
it almost it feels odd this is the connect this is not the playstation move

1278
03:42:13,690 --> 03:42:26,649
this is the playstation move okay what about just dance i don't i don't play just dance

1279
03:42:27,370 --> 03:42:47,530
okay hold on this is better than this i don't even remember which one of these i liked more

1280
03:42:47,610 --> 03:43:07,850
probably the uh do i like charizard more than i like charmeleon yeah i think so playstation

1281
03:43:07,850 --> 03:43:15,430
one i don't like better than the playstation like three though xbox one is xbox one's definitely

1282
03:43:15,430 --> 03:43:25,219
better than the playstation one just because of the introduction of analogs i don't like the

1283
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:37,059
fruit slice this is superior to me are these the same thing one of them is just wireless

1284
03:43:41,500 --> 03:43:47,940
wait is this just the wireless version of this it is isn't it this dualshock 2 dualshock 3

1285
03:43:48,659 --> 03:43:55,989
these are like the same wait which one of these is which one of these is which

1286
03:43:57,319 --> 03:44:12,379
it's ps3 and ps2 right okay they look the same okay dualshock 2 has the wire okay yeah

1287
03:44:12,940 --> 03:44:30,309
it belongs there i'm all right with this the rest of this shit is just jokey weird stuff that i've

1288
03:44:30,309 --> 03:44:41,319
never used so hold on let me go back up here i really like the it's very minimal the dreamcast

1289
03:44:41,319 --> 03:44:48,790
controller is super minimal gets the job done it's got nice triggers it fits in your hand well

1290
03:44:48,790 --> 03:44:52,469
it's got that cool screen you got you guys didn't get to see that when we did all the dreamcast

1291
03:44:52,469 --> 03:44:59,500
stuff there's a little screen that is your memory card that had all the cool random little it would

1292
03:44:59,500 --> 03:45:03,180
play little animations you could use it you could select things you could have in-game features it

1293
03:45:03,180 --> 03:45:11,959
was pretty cool the vmu doesn't have a right analog didn't need it though this is back when

1294
03:45:11,959 --> 03:45:21,379
two analogs weren't really necessary i mean that's not minimal it's an analog four face buttons and

1295
03:45:21,379 --> 03:45:31,079
a d-pad there's no other analog and it's spread out it has the same amount of buttons as a super

1296
03:45:31,079 --> 03:45:35,770
super antenna controller now the screen is just like an added feature that's in the in the

1297
03:45:35,770 --> 03:45:44,309
controller it but the actual physical controller itself is very basic oh well fuck i forgot the

1298
03:45:44,309 --> 03:45:50,229
original xbox below it belongs way down here i forgot i just had a memory the weird sideways

1299
03:45:50,229 --> 03:45:56,200
tilted face buttons yeah no get out of here this thing sucked i completely forgot about that

1300
03:45:57,590 --> 03:46:03,829
the like like it was printed on incorrectly type of scenario no yeah that's below the wii u

1301
03:46:04,629 --> 03:46:14,340
i hated that those got printed incorrectly from like the machine and they had like 50 000 of them

1302
03:46:14,340 --> 03:46:21,379
already made and the the foreman on the at the factory was just like just do it like this just

1303
03:46:21,379 --> 03:46:28,840
do it it's a feature no yeah this that i hated those i don't think it's worse than the keyboard

1304
03:46:28,840 --> 03:46:36,579
like the dreamcast keyboard with a grill or the connect no the connect is cooler this this is no

1305
03:46:36,579 --> 03:46:46,979
get that out of here this is the i can't sit still all right the the steam controller is better than

1306
03:46:46,979 --> 03:46:53,909
like the camping grill okay it is i'll give that to you this is not a dreamcast keyboard what the

1307
03:46:53,909 --> 03:47:42,170
hell is this then is this a game cube keyboard have you even touched a steam controller where the

1308
03:47:42,170 --> 03:48:02,920
fuck is it yeah i own one i own one but i don't know where it is never mind i thought i had one

1309
03:48:02,920 --> 03:48:07,899
in the closet back there i bought here's how you can tell that i'm lying about this because i'm

1310
03:48:07,899 --> 03:48:11,659
gonna give you an elaborate story and it's the only reason why you'd hear this i'm not just making

1311
03:48:11,659 --> 03:48:15,819
it up on the fly you didn't have time to make this up i bought a steam controller because i

1312
03:48:15,819 --> 03:48:19,340
currently like maybe this is probably like three three and a half years ago i got back into world

1313
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:26,860
of warcraft and during the uh legion whatever it was um what was it called yeah the lab the

1314
03:48:26,860 --> 03:48:32,059
expansion pack that people liked like two or three years ago so i wanted to not use my keyboard and

1315
03:48:32,059 --> 03:48:37,100
mouse to play world of warcraft i desperately wanted to lean back and lie on a couch and just

1316
03:48:37,100 --> 03:48:40,299
play world of warcraft from the computer so i was like hold on a minute wait i can do the steam

1317
03:48:40,299 --> 03:48:47,020
controller because i can map it everything can be mapped to this to it being like a pc keyboard

1318
03:48:47,020 --> 03:48:52,299
right so i tried to do it and i realized that trying to use the steam controller to play world

1319
03:48:52,299 --> 03:49:00,139
of warcraft was impossible and i could only really map like four buttons or like five buttons to

1320
03:49:00,139 --> 03:49:05,659
spells and abilities so i would it worked technically but i could really only do like three

1321
03:49:05,659 --> 03:49:13,219
moves so i had to just sit there and do the same like three or four move rotation and it worked

1322
03:49:13,219 --> 03:49:20,620
until i got to like level like 22 and then i just gave up because i got too many abilities

1323
03:49:21,340 --> 03:49:34,629
how is that a problem with the steam controller because the steam controller has the pads

1324
03:49:35,350 --> 03:49:40,860
the track the mouse pads to make it so you can actually utilize like a mouse or utilize like

1325
03:49:40,860 --> 03:49:47,180
turning around and move like you can't map that kind of shit to uh you can't have a mouse b on

1326
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:55,459
like your xbox controller it's like the axis is too like finicky don't worry in bfa you only have

1327
03:49:55,459 --> 03:50:05,690
four abilities anyways i stopped playing after legion there's literally an add-on that solves

1328
03:50:05,690 --> 03:50:18,870
your problem now well back to world of warcraft i played what yeah i played like three years three

1329
03:50:18,870 --> 03:50:24,950
and a half years ago i streamed i streamed wow remember karazhan it's the worst remember one of

1330
03:50:24,950 --> 03:50:31,459
the top three worst streams i've ever done you guys don't remember that that was peak me trying

1331
03:50:31,459 --> 03:50:35,719
to get the steam controller to work why am i putting my headphones in there's no reason to

1332
03:50:35,719 --> 03:50:47,190
there's no sounds you can work your way up to an officer in my guild did you do the door handles

1333
03:50:47,190 --> 03:50:52,760
tier list why the fuck would i ever do a door handles tier list put it in the chat i'll do it

1334
03:50:52,760 --> 03:51:15,079
next uh all right i think i'm done i'm happy with this these are originals why is the fight stick

1335
03:51:15,079 --> 03:51:31,129
lower than the game cube keyboard what is this karazhan 7.1 burp uh i don't because i don't use

1336
03:51:31,129 --> 03:51:46,299
fight sticks i don't know am i desynced i shouldn't be all right let's do door handles

1337
03:51:51,850 --> 03:52:28,389
door handles tier list uh right this is fucking stupid i'm more of like a toilet flush handle

1338
03:52:28,389 --> 03:52:37,620
kind of guy i don't like i don't like the just regular just little doorknobs because if you

1339
03:52:37,620 --> 03:52:42,870
put moisturizer on your hands you can't open them you're stuck in the room if you have any like oil

1340
03:52:42,870 --> 03:52:54,549
or moisturizer or anything there's like a keypad i have to remember a code wait a minute this is a

1341
03:52:54,549 --> 03:53:04,059
code and a toilet flusher okay that's cool these ones fun fact about these doorknobs guys they're

1342
03:53:04,059 --> 03:53:08,540
not secure at all because on the other end is a hole that's right in the middle of that fucking

1343
03:53:08,540 --> 03:53:16,170
thing that somebody just has to stick a a little pin in there and can pop the lock and open the

1344
03:53:16,170 --> 03:53:31,340
door those are not secure you you can you can get into those what is this one i don't know it looks

1345
03:53:31,340 --> 03:53:36,180
it looks exactly the fucking same i'm not into this kind of stuff it's like too it's too like

1346
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:42,260
elaborate for me just give me like the the toilet handle it's not even that's not even a door handle

1347
03:53:42,260 --> 03:53:55,530
that's a part of a train track crystal now this stuff breaks there's a shower head this is dumb

1348
03:53:55,530 --> 03:54:01,719
it's like that you know a little a little turn no no that's not no this is up at a because that's a

1349
03:54:04,149 --> 03:54:17,319
because you can't fuck that up you just you grab and you turn and push no this is like a that's

1350
03:54:17,319 --> 03:54:33,479
like a candy no again put these down here and put that down here all right i have a lot of season

1352
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:08,579

04:33:42,700 --> 04:33:53,700
it's up there somewhere that game was really sloppy but it was really really interesting

1508
04:33:54,419 --> 04:34:05,799
and plus shadow the classes is really great you can't deny that minecraft wasn't like a

1509
04:34:05,799 --> 04:34:11,080
huge success but i don't think it i personally don't i'm not going to put it in b

1510
04:34:15,979 --> 04:34:23,180
isn't take take two is now take two is like all the sports games and technically gta but

1511
04:34:23,979 --> 04:34:41,060
they publish they don't really make they don't really develop right naughty dog naughty dog's

1512
04:34:41,060 --> 04:34:52,860
doing pretty well like they actually like really well i have to i'm gonna i'll head back to this

1513
04:35:01,939 --> 04:35:06,020
the rest of these i kind of i don't really know what they were turtle rock they made

1514
04:35:06,020 --> 04:35:25,740
evolve right square enix so idos idos is technically what io now like no that's like

1515
04:35:25,740 --> 04:35:39,900
hitman but it's not was io interactive on here i don't see io interactive on here so should i

1516
04:35:39,900 --> 04:35:55,509
put i should i do idos as if it is hitman because idos technically was hitman but it wasn't but it

1517
04:35:55,509 --> 04:36:08,119
was i'm gonna pretend that this is a hitman company no that's not supposed to be there

1518
04:36:14,299 --> 04:36:19,819
nexon this is like the massive multiplayer company that they like half of the mmos you

1520
04:36:35,700 --> 04:36:45,580
the ones are the ones that were responsible for shadow of mordor if i'm gonna put wb up here then

1521
04:36:45,580 --> 04:37:02,500
monolith should be up here too higher than that too many video game companies dice not doing it

1522
04:37:02,500 --> 04:37:09,130
for me not doing it for me game freak now this is pokemon i'll tell you it has to go down here

1523
04:37:09,130 --> 04:37:15,259
because i don't really i don't have much experience with pokemon old acclaim here's the thing about

1524
04:37:15,259 --> 04:37:22,380
old acclaim all their games were dog shit but they all were charming in some kind of way their games

1525
04:37:22,380 --> 04:37:43,450
were terrible but they did a lot of interesting things that's gonna be indeed all i remember is

1526
04:37:43,450 --> 04:37:53,450
the old wwf acclaim games and they were so bad valve below ea i'm not just wait wait i'm not done

1527
04:37:53,450 --> 04:37:59,860
with the list i have to get everybody in the right spot and then from there we add on to it and i put

1528
04:37:59,860 --> 04:38:05,639
that look i'm just getting him the general idea this is just they're gonna change it's not like

1529
04:38:05,639 --> 04:38:15,939
wait rare is about blizzard just hold on just i got there's a lot to compress here what is this

1530
04:38:16,500 --> 04:38:35,110
fear axis what's your axis civilization x-com i don't have enough experience with it the rest

1531
04:38:35,110 --> 04:38:42,520
of these i really don't know obsidian is good but we'll see how their new game is who knows

1532
04:38:44,580 --> 04:38:49,939
coffee stain is that's like the goat simulator team right and they did some other what else have

1533
04:38:49,939 --> 04:39:12,900
they done what else have they done i don't know sanctum coffee stain um deep rock they published

1534
04:39:12,900 --> 04:39:31,959
deep rock but they didn't develop it does that count maybe i guess it does in a way okay where

1535
04:39:31,959 --> 04:39:39,080
is oh god this is gonna be fucking hell sorting through quantic dream i don't think i have enough

1536
04:39:39,080 --> 04:39:53,509
experience didn't they make one game it was like a movie game grasshopper is we'll see we'll see

1537
04:39:53,509 --> 04:39:57,669
when the new no more heroes comes up because they haven't really done anything good at all in the

1538
04:39:57,750 --> 04:40:12,060
last like at least probably four or five years it's tough oh they're the okay yeah yeah yeah

1539
04:40:13,180 --> 04:40:25,799
uh i like detroit become human i thought it was fun no more heroes is awesome but i haven't really

1540
04:40:25,799 --> 04:40:33,099
done anything in a long time that i really played that i thought was like interesting

1541
04:40:35,979 --> 04:40:43,500
how do i alienate every gamer except for the people that like from software sony capcom rock

1542
04:40:43,500 --> 04:40:50,229
star nintendo naughty dog interplay midway how laboratories rocksteady um stardew valley guy

1543
04:40:50,229 --> 04:41:07,610
lucas arts eiko eidos and bandai namco except for the all those people rockstar at a gta5 was

1544
04:41:07,610 --> 04:41:17,290
fucking awesome red dead redemption 2 was really fun no i i am one of these is going to gum bs

1545
04:41:18,009 --> 04:41:24,599
now you gotta wait let me do my first draft i'm still trying to juggle of

1546
04:41:25,479 --> 04:41:47,560
what what the hell e-ha games is i don't know what this is what is this one i don't know what

1547
04:41:47,560 --> 04:41:53,979
it is somebody can tell me all right the reason why capcom is up here is because the last like

1548
04:41:53,979 --> 04:41:59,299
four or five games that capcom has come up with have been awesome resident evil 2 was fucking

1549
04:41:59,299 --> 04:42:11,380
awesome monster hunter world was awesome um i heard devil may cry was awesome i mean they've

1550
04:42:11,380 --> 04:42:22,040
been knocking it out of the park recently this is you guys told me 2019 resident evil 2 was

1551
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:29,939
fantastic it was really really really really fucking good do you think that capcom in the

1552
04:42:29,939 --> 04:42:47,060
last few years should be below like epic games unless you're like play fortnite no okay look

1553
04:42:47,860 --> 04:42:53,400
all the companies that are in b and c i have not gone over and thought about yet this is

1554
04:42:53,720 --> 04:43:01,060
this is gonna take a lot a long time let me just remember okay insomniac insomniac made the new

1555
04:43:01,060 --> 04:43:06,569
spider-man one right they're up here that new spider-man game was really really really fucking

1556
04:43:06,569 --> 04:43:14,069
good so up here i'll figure it out a minute yacht club games made shovel knight i haven't

1557
04:43:14,069 --> 04:43:24,060
didn't really played that much irrational games what the hell is that it's so familiar what is it

1558
04:43:30,200 --> 04:43:37,770
bioshock right okay right right right right right right right bioshock infinite was good

1559
04:43:40,040 --> 04:43:54,520
didn't they just didn't they liquid didn't they they got liquidated right was it was it i i remember

1560
04:43:54,520 --> 04:44:06,139
like in bioshock infinite i thought it was fun but i mean bioshock one about the pandemic help me out

1561
04:44:06,139 --> 04:44:24,919
here this is like every video game company i'm trying pandemic was what battlefront destroy all

1562
04:44:24,919 --> 04:44:45,669
humans okay all right all right okay hold on i liked those respawn entertainment that's uh it's

1563
04:44:45,669 --> 04:44:56,360
like yeah i don't i don't play their games atari doesn't really exist anymore they still kind of

1564
04:44:56,360 --> 04:45:01,319
do what's the last thing that isn't the last game they made like a dragon ball z fighting game

1565
04:45:02,040 --> 04:45:19,770
i have not enough experience recently i know they're a classic company but we're talking like

1566
04:45:19,770 --> 04:45:24,569
recently like the last five to ten years no oh i don't know where the fuck they belong probably

1567
04:45:24,569 --> 04:45:35,939
up here santa monica studio is the god of war studio right or is that technically sony

1568
04:45:36,659 --> 04:45:57,619
they belong up here it's god of war yeah okay yep no they but they they belong up here all

1569
04:45:57,619 --> 04:46:06,810
their games are like just always good sierra like it's hard to mix in these really old ass

1570
04:46:06,810 --> 04:46:24,259
fucking companies with the ones that are currently you know what i mean there's too many impressive

1571
04:46:24,259 --> 04:46:39,580
game what is impressive games what what did they do no that's a super massive games until dawn

1572
04:46:45,900 --> 04:46:54,889
here's the thing trying to do this is tricky because not only is it the games that they made

1573
04:46:55,939 --> 04:47:02,020
but each company has like a separate tier of games that they've made so all right like sega for

1574
04:47:02,020 --> 04:47:07,939
instance sega as a whole exists and then when you double click sega you get the big drop down of

1575
04:47:07,939 --> 04:47:22,659
like 50 games so try it's hard to place them this tier list is fucked well hold on let me

1576
04:47:23,299 --> 04:47:38,759
let me do this first um i know it's gonna be like this i'm gonna let me work backwards

1577
04:48:28,779 --> 04:48:51,990
uh it's taking a lot of brain power to do this all right um this is hitman right this is guys

1578
04:48:51,990 --> 04:49:13,830
hitman i'm working it up see why are you doing an la noir face so uh where were you uh at four

1579
04:49:13,830 --> 04:49:41,099
o'clock eastern time were you in front of the store i can't even fucking do it now all i think

1580
04:49:41,099 --> 04:49:51,459
about is you guys looking at me with like three buttons that are watching my face gearbox is down

1581
04:49:51,459 --> 04:50:12,380
here i don't i'm sorry gear i'm telling you we're good gearbox is i don't borderlands you can

1582
04:50:12,380 --> 04:50:34,630
borderlands i don't care about borderlands no it's not f it's but why are these even on here

1583
04:50:37,799 --> 04:50:45,619
bethesda is still like making games though konami is not let's just be very very clear about this

1584
04:50:46,970 --> 04:50:53,740
konami doesn't even make fucking video games anymore didn't they like abandon their video

1585
04:50:53,740 --> 04:51:13,220
game development ea is very close to d-minus well let's get back up here naughty dog versus

1586
04:51:13,220 --> 04:51:20,490
insomniac i don't think i'm i'm gonna leave this alone i think this is accurate hold on what was

1587
04:51:20,490 --> 04:51:40,889
the last couple nintendo games that i played mario maker 2 smash brothers no yeah no they're

1588
04:51:40,889 --> 04:51:49,479
still making really good stuff they are so is rock star so is capcom so it's sony santa monica

1589
04:51:49,479 --> 04:51:54,599
just released like one of the best games like ever fucking made right like ever according to

1590
04:51:54,599 --> 04:51:59,000
a lot of people i haven't played it i don't know i've played some of the other ones it's a lie

1591
04:51:59,799 --> 04:52:18,099
the labo exists it's right all right hold on hitman is awesome it's a ton of fun but also

1592
04:52:18,099 --> 04:52:21,779
remember like this is this this is a deep these are defunct studios so it's hard to do this

1593
04:52:22,580 --> 04:52:38,599
blitz the league 2 exists because this company decided to have it that means a lot we're just

1594
04:52:38,599 --> 04:53:05,110
we're just in b right now we're just in b dipping into c but hold on i don't know i don't know if

1595
04:53:05,110 --> 04:53:35,610
lucas arts should be up here technically technically games like tf2 dota and cs go they still get

1596
04:53:35,610 --> 04:53:45,930
updates technically so i mean you can't like valve has a bunch of stuff in development right

1597
04:53:45,930 --> 04:53:54,009
now don't they this would be all the way up here it would but a valve being down at c is already

1598
04:53:54,009 --> 04:54:04,330
like a huge fucking issue that's a huge deal imagine this list five years ago if valve wasn't

1599
04:54:04,330 --> 04:54:29,000
up here i would be a crazy person so this is already very bad um bungee shouldn't be down that

1600
04:54:29,000 --> 04:54:50,630
far rare has to do something rare has to do something rare they have to go down here i'm

1601
04:54:50,630 --> 04:54:59,259
sorry they do they have to do something they have to make a game no i know but rare rare allowing

1602
04:55:00,470 --> 04:55:06,470
banjo to be a character that is that is a cool character that exists banjo is a character it's

1603
04:55:06,470 --> 04:55:18,650
from a classic video game series um if you don't okay if you don't want spoilers for anything mute

1604
04:55:18,650 --> 04:55:23,000
right now like if you don't want any spoilers for anything just mute right now i'm gonna just say

1605
04:55:23,000 --> 04:55:29,770
spoilers so mute right now if you don't want any spoilers for something mute i'll go like this um

1606
04:55:30,409 --> 04:55:34,169
some people don't want to know the characters in smash until they like actually get their hands on

1607
04:55:34,169 --> 04:55:42,599
it so that's like a literal like a video game like marvel spoiler um them allowing banjo in

1608
04:55:43,580 --> 04:55:51,029
you know what i'm saying that's not them they didn't do that is your hair in a bun what do you

1609
04:55:51,029 --> 04:56:04,419
mean what what the fuck how long has this been in my hair for did i start combing my hair this

things my fucking legacy how is ico i was t i go not an a we'll get hope just i listen to me

1637
05:02:12,380 --> 05:02:18,810
the issue with doing a video game company tier list is as if every single one of these was a

1638
05:02:18,810 --> 05:02:26,389
version of in and out moving one of these causes a huge issue for a bunch of people every one of

1639
05:02:26,389 --> 05:02:39,340
these is in and out burger but like in and out different uh like variations of it so all of them

1640
05:02:39,340 --> 05:03:00,330
are bad i didn't say it i didn't say that you did i have to okay if this is the thing that people

1641
05:03:00,330 --> 05:03:08,200
remember you for i'm sorry not anything else germa 985's legacy is remember that one time he

1642
05:03:08,200 --> 05:03:21,159
did the games company tier list yeah that's true if this is what i leave behind then i didn't leave

game which then that full game was oh we're gonna make that one too so that is a a sort of copy

1653
05:05:03,750 --> 05:05:13,750
of a mod and then you have inside of that copy of a mod you have a mod inside of that game that

1683
05:10:58,950 --> 05:11:08,869
jumps farther and hard to control use the right and left arrow keys to move side this is really

1686
05:11:47,319 --> 05:12:11,669
how do i get this is why it's a math game right how do i get that one how do i get this bonus

1687
05:12:13,430 --> 05:12:40,740
i don't know how to get this bonus oh you can jump into the walls i didn't know that you could do

1722
05:26:23,290 --> 05:26:41,189
next one what's another like really good one in the time we have remaining play run three uh run

1723
05:26:41,189 --> 05:26:51,020
three is not as popular as run two let me see what we got we've got b cubed i feel like i can't do

1724
05:26:51,020 --> 05:27:05,979
that one run two block sores awesome tanks parking fury papa's sushi ria there is no game what is

1725
05:27:05,979 --> 05:27:19,029
there is no game block sores block block block yeah all right right flip the block over this way

1726
05:27:19,029 --> 05:27:22,549
and over that way to get it to fall in the hole you'll be flipping blocks in your sleep

1727
05:27:23,189 --> 05:27:37,610
okay let's do it make sure you can see what i'm doing here cool math needs to be moved i think

1728
05:27:40,680 --> 05:28:05,529
something uh block sores does it fit all right so the aim of the game is to get the block to fall

1729
05:28:05,529 --> 05:28:14,950
into the square hole at the end of each stage there are 33 stages so to move the block around

1730
05:28:14,950 --> 05:28:21,369
use left right up and down arrow keys be careful not to fall off the edge well here we go get the

1731
05:28:21,369 --> 05:28:25,770
block to fall into the square at hole at the end of each stage there are 33 stages all right

1732
05:28:26,330 --> 05:28:30,439
move the block around the world use left and right up and down be careful not to fall off the edge

1733
05:28:31,000 --> 05:28:46,259
the level we restarted if you do now it's such a weird this is such a weird game to capture

1734
05:28:47,060 --> 05:28:55,669
is that better bridges and switches are located in many levels switches are activated when they are

1735
05:28:55,669 --> 05:29:02,470
pressed right you do not need to stay resting on the switch to keep it open heavy x-shaped ones

1736
05:29:02,470 --> 05:29:09,459
and soft round ones soft switches are activated when any part of your block presses it hard

1737
05:29:09,459 --> 05:29:13,299
which required much more pressure so your block must be standing on it to activate it okay

1738
05:29:14,259 --> 05:29:18,709
when activated each switch may behave differently some will swap the bridges from open to closed

1739
05:29:18,709 --> 05:29:26,459
yeah there's a different stuff pump up the iq for this one green or red colored squares will

1740
05:29:26,459 --> 05:29:33,740
flash to indicate which bridges are being operated orange tiles are far more fragile

1741
05:29:33,740 --> 05:29:37,099
than the rest of the land if your block stands up vertically on an orange tile tile will give

1742
05:29:37,099 --> 05:29:47,139
way and your block will fall this this parentheses switch teleports your block to different locations

1743
05:29:48,020 --> 05:29:54,970
splitting it into two smaller blocks that's why i think this might be a little too much for me

1744
05:29:54,970 --> 05:29:58,970
this might this might be it might be not too much for like an eighth grader but it's too much for me

1745
05:30:05,669 --> 05:30:11,700
okay you can select different blocks the passcode for each stage

1746
05:30:14,979 --> 05:30:25,900
it is located in the top right corner so the dead it's like megaman let's go now that i can see the

1747
05:30:25,900 --> 05:32:21,430
screen all right i get it he was joking funny man pretending to be stupid he is enlightened he's a

1748
05:32:29,560 --> 05:33:12,490
stop no shit wait pretty good oh shit he was just pretending to be funny man he was pretending to be

1827
05:54:37,509 --> 05:54:43,880
late so sorry that we had to start so late but the internet was horrible but i'm thinking that

1828
05:54:43,880 --> 05:54:54,729
this vpn may have helped six hours 93 less than 10 000 drop frames in six hours is actually pretty

1829
05:54:54,729 --> 05:55:09,159
good let's see what happens tomorrow because we i did i gotta do a test for at least a few days

1830
05:55:09,159 --> 05:55:14,729
because you've we've seen this internet be perfect and then it's been oh drop 30 000 frames

1831
05:55:15,610 --> 05:55:23,479
we'll see how it goes but i had a lot of fun i like to do this i like to just kind of hang out and

1832
05:55:24,360 --> 05:55:28,840
talk shit and play random stuff and just be on cam but it doesn't happen that often doesn't happen

1833
05:55:28,840 --> 05:55:36,970
that often can't wait to not see half the carnival stream because of this well lucky for all of us

1834
05:55:36,970 --> 05:55:44,419
the carnival stream is not happening in las vegas like here i'm gonna be on location for that

1835
05:55:45,220 --> 05:55:56,729
so it's not happening here in vegas that's all you that's all you need to know

1836
05:55:58,180 --> 05:56:08,040
speak of the devil just dropped a frame right there on location with worse internet now that

1837
05:56:08,040 --> 05:56:15,020
would be sad i don't think that's gonna happen it's not it's not even gonna be in the state of

1838
05:56:15,020 --> 05:56:23,020
nevada it's uh across the country actually what happens now now we uh we we wind down a little

1839
05:56:24,360 --> 05:56:30,659
we say good night we turn off this screen so again tomorrow we're gonna do uh dos

1840
05:56:33,580 --> 05:56:37,180
join me for dos tomorrow we're gonna play there's at least a few of them that i think would be fun

1841
05:56:37,180 --> 05:56:49,349
to do uh sorry we had to start at like 5 30 pacific tonight it's not my intention

1842
05:56:49,349 --> 05:57:02,599
and i probably lost some of the subs from six or seven hours ago i'm sorry about that

1843
05:57:03,479 --> 05:57:10,419
when the stream gets killed like that i lose subs but uh we'll try again tomorrow

1844
05:57:13,540 --> 05:57:29,939
dos games and let's go back to earlier what is the german smile well that's terrifying

1845
05:57:32,229 --> 05:57:39,430
but thank you to frodian weapon for the 250 sorry for almost spoiling uh redacted

1846
05:57:39,990 --> 05:57:43,750
i did not get the memo if it makes you feel better i do feel bad about it so could you please call

1847
05:57:43,750 --> 05:57:49,669
off your small battalion of rats i haven't actually seen one yet but i know they're there

1848
05:57:49,669 --> 05:58:01,659
among us people unsubscribe over that no no no no i mean i don't have uh i do credits at the end

1849
05:58:01,659 --> 05:58:09,259
of the stream they scroll up and when a stream gets dropped to zero and i have to stop it

1850
05:58:09,900 --> 05:58:13,419
there's new credits that are made because it only takes the subs that come through

1851
05:58:14,380 --> 05:58:21,740
for that vod for that broadcast not the one from earlier so every time a new vod is created or a

1852
05:58:21,740 --> 05:58:32,250
drop to zero the subs kind of start at zero again it's annoying but it happens no i don't mean like

1853
05:58:32,250 --> 05:58:38,090
people are unsubscribing over that you know just the plug-in doesn't really work so well

1854
05:58:39,419 --> 05:58:48,779
but uh what i don't know fronty what are you talking about here what spoiler for what uh

1857
05:59:06,979 --> 05:59:14,490

1858
05:59:14,490 --> 05:59:24,220
hundred and fucking plus dollars so i don't worry about that thank you there was a string of like

1860
05:59:35,450 --> 05:59:40,569

1864
06:00:15,939 --> 06:00:18,979
don't forget you promised to lip sync the entirety of mambo number five

1865
06:00:19,619 --> 06:00:25,540
germa lied about lip syncing mambo number five i'm sure it's already been created drinking skills

1866
06:00:25,540 --> 06:00:35,909
came in with five community subs right now thank you thank you drinking skills appreciate it i did

1867
06:00:35,909 --> 06:00:49,270
i did it yesterday there's a clip of me uh lip syncing the first like 12 25 seconds there's

1868
06:00:49,270 --> 06:00:55,189
only one bit message that you can't see and it's five dollars and 37 from bingus tingle that said

1869
06:00:55,189 --> 06:01:03,540
germa when are you gonna play ed ed and eddie online is this the deep fake one let's see

1870
06:01:11,369 --> 06:01:35,979
yeah this is not even real this is deep fake you're right well i see people put me in situations

1871
06:01:35,979 --> 06:01:45,779
they deep fake me i can hear it in the distance uh but thank you uh buster boy for the three bucks

1872
06:01:50,299 --> 06:01:54,860
thank you to stiff funky chicken for the three bucks i don't know if you're in the mood for

1873
06:01:54,860 --> 06:01:58,779
watching videos this stream but i made some pretty short ones no links in chat so you can find the

1874
06:01:58,779 --> 06:02:05,540
three vids on youtube under this username uh hold the videos because we're going to do a

1875
06:02:06,819 --> 06:02:12,819
i'm gonna do it we're gonna do a once a month or once every probably to keep make sure that like

1876
06:02:12,819 --> 06:02:17,380
clips and videos are relevant and art is relevant we'll probably do it once every couple weeks

1877
06:02:18,819 --> 06:02:29,819
a video art community segment i've decided it's probably a good idea but i want to do

1878
06:02:29,819 --> 06:02:39,349
more than once a month because i once you do it stuff like that like i feel like mambo number five

1879
06:02:39,990 --> 06:02:45,909
stuff would not necessarily be relevant in like a month right so if somebody were to do something

1880
06:02:49,500 --> 06:03:00,009
every like two or three weeks i think sounds pretty good i like that idea but hold on to some

1881
06:03:00,009 --> 06:03:05,959
of that stuff we'll have an avenue for that eventually here over the coming a few weeks i

1882
06:03:05,959 --> 06:03:13,720
think a couple weeks probably but i do appreciate anything that you make you guys are really fucking

1883
06:03:13,720 --> 06:03:23,099
talented but thank you thank you dork cube for the 250 this candy tier list is inherently flawed

1884
06:03:23,099 --> 06:03:28,380
because it doesn't include all the types of m&m's i might agree that plain m&m's are f or d tier but

1885
06:03:28,380 --> 06:03:35,580
coffee nut m&m's a tier pretzel m&m's s tier also all this candy talk is reminding me of when

1886
06:03:36,220 --> 06:03:42,299
my cadets group it's the knockoff boy scouts would go to the memorial day parade and shoot candy

1887

1888
06:03:56,060 --> 06:04:19,240
walmart boy scouts a candy catapult that's so ridiculous m&m's are worthy of a b

1890
06:04:24,490 --> 06:04:35,689
