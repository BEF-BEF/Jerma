1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:07,280
Alrighty, so let's get rid of this disgusting, horrible floor.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,910
Do I even have a shovel?

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,650
I got a crappy stone shovel.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,910
Let's go down one more so I can...

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,910
Oh god, I forgot I did that.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,089
It's okay, it's okay.

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,570
We are going to look top shelf in no time.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,570
Look at this.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,570
Oh my goodness.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,369
Looks good, looks good.

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,270
So now my house will not look like a prison cell.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,509
Actually prison cells are not typically on dirt.

13
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,939
At least in this country, at least in the United States.

14
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,630
Prison cells are... ah, damn it.

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,829
Oh well.

16
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,070
I'm not even going to have enough.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,070
I've got a bunch of trees and everything.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,070
At least it'll be enough to get half the house.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,689
So I have jury duty tomorrow.

20
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:15,000
If any of you know what jury duty is, it's not a fun thing.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So for those of you that are younger,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or for those of you that are not from the United States,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
jury duty essentially is...

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, somebody gets in trouble, right?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Somebody breaks the law.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Somebody like, let's say like Steve Dickinson

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
throws a rock through Mary J. Stevenson's window.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,670
So he gets arrested and they put him on trial.

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,670
And what has to happen is there has to be a jury of his peers.

30
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,670
So there has to be a jury of people that are not lawbreakers

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,670
that are sitting on the jury.

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,670
They don't have to be non-lawbreakers,

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,980
but they have to at least be sane individuals.

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,109
So I got a call.

35
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,109
I got a thing in the mail that says,

36
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,480
hey, you're one of these people that needs to be on the jury.

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
And what we have to do is determine

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,280
if the guy that threw the rock through the window is actually guilty.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
And sometimes it can last a long time.

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,650
Sometimes you have to come back multiple days.

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,889
And it really, really, really stinks.

42
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,889
I really don't want to do it.

43
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,259
But it's against the law to not do it.

44
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,259
So if I don't do it, let's say I just don't go tomorrow,

45
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,430
I'll get arrested.

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,080
They will literally come to my house and arrest the crap out of me.

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,539
But that's what I'm doing tomorrow.

48
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,539
If any of you have ever had to do jury duty,

49
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,840
I'd like to know about your experience,

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,840
if you're old enough, because I'm pretty certain

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
you have to be at least 18 to...

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,590
You have to be at least 18 to be allowed to be a juror.

53
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,300
So let me know what experience you had.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
If any at all.

55
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,800
Now I'm going to go back and get those trees that I missed before.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,939
Oh, look at that.

57
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,939
The sun is setting.

58
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,300
What a perfect time to leave the house.

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,379
And I still haven't made a bed.

60
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,379
Oh, my God.

61
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,379
I have enough wool, right?

62
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,680
That is priority numero uno when I get back,

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,050
is to make a damn bed.

64
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,270
This is not a good idea.

65
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,449
I probably should just turn back and make a bed.

66
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,139
That's what I'm going to do.

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,189
All right, give me this wood.

68
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,069
A couple of pieces is all it's going to take.

69
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,569
Three pieces to be exact.

70
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:44,280
All right, let's make this my floating work benches.

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,539
It's like this, right?

72
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:48,539
I believe it is.

73
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,539
It doesn't matter what wool you use.

74
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,719
Excellent.

75
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,719
Okay, so here's my bedroom over here.

76
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,280
This is going to be the sleeping quarters.

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Right there.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
All right, so now I have a spawn point,

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
and I have a place where I...

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay, this is great.

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
This is fantastic.

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I am very, very happy about this.

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,419
So let's skip this stupid nighttime business.

84
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,170
Monsters can't get through sand, right?

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,410
I hope not.

86
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,379
Any holes?

87
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,379
Do I have any holes in my house?

88
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,379
I will just get woken up and get murdered.

89
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,939
All right.

90
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,939
Good night.

91
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,939
Good morrow.

92
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,939
I will see you all tomorrow, everyone.

93
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,110
Good night.

94
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,110
Do, do, do, do, do.

95
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, well, that was quick.

96
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,670
What?

97
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,670
Speed sleep.

98
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,670
Minecraft.

99
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,939
You know, I'm going to fix a couple of things first and foremost.

100
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,560
I want to make my house a little nicer looking.

101
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,660
I don't want to have it be this jagged mess

102
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,959
of, like, sharp objects pointing out.

103
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,060
Get rid of this.

104
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,189
Get rid of these.

105
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,189
They're just eyesores.

106
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:12,569
Not going to have any of that on Jerma's castle.

107
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:20,180
Close this up after I do this, of course.

108
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,939
Where's the cobblestone?

109
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,939
There it is.

110
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:23,939
All right.

111
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:24,939
Cobblestone.

112
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,180
Where's the wall?

113
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,250
There it is.

114
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,639
Okay.

115
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,879
So it needs to go over here.

116
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,879
Right there, right there, right there, right there.

117
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,879
Didn't I just delete all that?

118
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,250
Oh, well.

119
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,250
At least it doesn't look like a complete mess.

120
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,470
There we go.

121
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,670
Knock you out of the way.

122
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:54,560
So I have a actual wall rather than a mess of crap.

123
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,310
Okay.

124
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,310
Oh, well, look at this.

125
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
Look at this.

126
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,310
Get the wood off of the edge of this house

127
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,310
and replace it with a stone

128
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,310
and then make the rest of the floor.

129
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,959
I don't even need trees.

130
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,959
There are a lot of misplaced blocks in this house.

131
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,959
Like, look at it.

132
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,959
Just look back.

133
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,139
I just got rid of most of the wood.

134
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,139
And look at this giant horror.

135
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,310
Look at how terrible this was.

136
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
You guys in the comments were right.

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,310
This house was an absolute horror show.

138
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,730
And I knew that.

139
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:37,250
But I was going to deny it until the day I died.

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,490
Let's start to fill in the blanks here a little bit.

141
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,879
If I can jump up here.

142
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,959
Okay.

143
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,459
So this is the wall.

144
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,230
Okay, good.

145
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,439
That's the, yeah.

146
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,439
Well, I'm going to have to flood the entire basement.

147
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,439
I'm going to have to deal with it.

148
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,439
Oh, no, my bed.

149
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm going to get wet sheets.

150
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,839
The reason why I'm doing this, I'm making three rooms.

151
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,839
At least for the start.

152
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,079
I'm going to have this big long room behind the bedroom.

153
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,319
Then next to the bedroom is going to be the workstation area.

154
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,819
And then that's pretty much the three rooms I want to work with.

155
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,819
At least for right now.

156
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,579
Let's plug this up.

157
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,579
All right.

158
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
Actually, I probably should do it like this.

159
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,259
Makes a little bit more sense that way.

160
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,939
Come on, get over there.

161
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:40,939
Get over there, Michael Phelps.

162
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,939
Let's go.

163
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,879
If anybody got that joke, I applaud you.

164
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,410
Give me this.

165
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,410
All right, let's put these down now.

166
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,699
This is the right level, though.

167
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,699
My brain just exploded.

168
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,699
I thought I was like two or three blocks up from where I actually was.

169
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,089
Oh, damn it.

170
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,089
I was.

171
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,089
I actually was like a block.

172
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,089
Oh, God, bear with me.

173
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,779
Okay, let's try this again.

174
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,980
Much better.

175
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Much better.

176
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,670
I don't want to waste them all here, though,

177
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,670
because I have an entire room that needs to be finished.

178
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,910
This one right here.

179
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,689
Oh, look at that.

180
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,690
This room is now done with the floor.

181
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,690
I'm going to take down that little piece in a minute here.

182
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,759
This ground looks like some...

183
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,759
Oh, it just looks terrible.

184
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,759
I can't even give you a description.

185
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,759
It looks that bad.

186
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,580
This bed can stay there.

187
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,330
Actually, no, it can't.

188
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,759
I want to move it,

189
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,509
because I want this wall to come down like this

190
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,200
and have this opening right here.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,629
Let's get rid of the sand for crying out loud.

192
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:09,340
All right, so now here's my thought.

193
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Ready?

194
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,769
So this is the main room, right?

195
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,769
After I get rid of this,

196
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:16,769
can I even get rid of that without...

197
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:17,769
Okay.

198
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,070
So here's the main room.

199
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,080
I want to be able to do all my crafting,

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
do all my dog training.

201
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
All that stuff is going to be in this room.

202
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,240
Move this out of the way.

203
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Might as well bring these things down now, right?

204
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,059
Because they've been floating in space for way too long.

205
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,990
Okay.

206
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,990
Get this off.

207
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,980
Probably should not be using this nice pickaxe to do it,

208
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,980
but I'll use a sapling.

209
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,740
That's not going to work, is it?

210
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,100
Maybe it is, but very slowly.

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,429
Come on now.

212
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,429
I know you can do it.

213
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:03,059
I know you can do it.

214
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,620
You can do it.

215
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Come on now.

216
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
Come on.

217
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,049
It's up there.

218
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,539
Oh, I destroyed it.

219
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,490
What the hell?

220
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,750
Oh, my God.

221
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
All it took was...

222
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,750
Oh, my God.

223
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,990
Jeez.

224
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
All right.

225
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,990
I do not want that to happen with that.

226
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,620
So I'll figure that out in a second.

227
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,720
Breaking my stuff.

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,019
So I want this whole line to be furnaces.

229
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,019
So let's go like this.

230
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,019
Put that there.

231
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,899
Oh, God.

232
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:44,899
Okay.

233
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,590
Did I break that too?

234
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,590
No, that's right there.

235
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,730
Okay.

236
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,730
This here.

237
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,889
Put my stuff that I almost just threw up.

238
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,889
My slime ball.

239
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,450
These are apparently worth a lot.

240
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,450
What the hell?

241
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,460
What was that?

242
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,460
What's hitting me?

243
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,279
Oh, shit.

244
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
Oh, my God.

245
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:18,259
I'm starving to death.

246
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,259
I really...

247
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,259
Why did I just eat that?

248
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,940
I could have just cooked that and got like full health.

249
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,570
Oh, my God.

250
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,740
Okay.

251
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,049
Chalk One Up for Jerma is really an idiot because I thought there was a monster in the ground

252
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,049
or something.

253
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,740
I was actually just starving to death.

254
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,360
My goodness gracious.
