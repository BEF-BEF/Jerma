1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,789
Hey, sorry. I was on my phone. I was looking on my phone. I was looking at stuff.

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:17,179
Hello everybody, uh, happy Saturday. Hope you're having a good Saturday. Hope you had a good week.

3
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:28,760
Hope you're all doing very, very, very well. How am I? I'm doing good. I'm doing as good as I can be.

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:49,429
He loves his phone. Not really. I mean, I- I like FaceTiming my mother. That's fun.

5
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,270
That's something you couldn't do five years ago. When did FaceTime- okay, when did FaceTime

6
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,409
become a thing people were doing? When are you like 15? 2016? When did FaceTime come up?

7
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:17,180
It was 10 years ago, was it? No, it wasn't. The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 couldn't do FaceTime,

8
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:31,659
could they? No, no, it was like 2015. One sec. It was 2013. Anybody else have this problem?

9
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:41,900
Is anybody else- is anybody else permanently in 2013, 2014? It's something- what happened in 2013,

10
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:54,060
2014? Like, I feel like 2014 is like- it's- that's just every year. It's not 2021. No, it's 2014.

11
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:12,199
Time loop. Well, I don't feel like it's 2021. I feel like it's at most 2015. Because in 2012,

12
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,900
the world ended. And what, like did our planet got like detonated and we all got uploaded to

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:34,099
the cloud or something? What do you mean? Unironically, yes. Oh, unironically, yes.

14
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,210
And maybe it's because you peaked in 2015. That's not true at all, by the way. Oh, you know,

15
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,210
at 20- every year kind of feels like 2014. I wish it was like 2015, 20- remember when I was

16
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,449
getting like a million views a video on YouTube? Oh man, like every day feels like it should be

17
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:58,340
2014, doesn't it? By the way, I inflated those numbers. It was like 600 or 700k.

18
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:07,500
But you round up, especially when you're marketing yourself. Anyway, today we're gonna play

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,439
Barn Finders. It's a game that I played very, very briefly for about 15 minutes while I was raging at

20
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,770
Fall Guys. During that like Fall Guys week where the game just came out and the servers were all

21
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,969
fucked up, I was- I tried to play it. I couldn't play it. And I was like, well, I gotta pivot. I

22
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:30,659
gotta do something else. And I had Barn Finders installed. I was like, I guess I'm gonna play this.

23
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,259
And I didn't give it the proper time and respect that I think it might deserve. Because Fall Guys

24
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,620
servers came back online. I wasn't even paying attention to this game. I was just raging about

25
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,979
the servers. And somebody like- it like baited me into thinking that like a Fall Guys dev was

26
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:49,379
talking to me. Remember that? Like that- that- I couldn't give the attention to Barn Finders that

27
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:54,659
it deserves. So what is Barn Finders? Barn- this is a game where you go search for antiques. You go

28
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:02,259
to auctions. And you sell antiques. It looks like it's gonna be right up my alley. That was

29
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:08,500
peaked, Jerma. Well, that was like a year ago. Not even. That was like seven months ago. If I

30
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,019
peaked- here, listen to me. If you're telling me that I peaked- I peaked career-wise like six months

31
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:24,250
ago? Holy shit, that's awesome. I can ride this shit for the next 10 years. I could put up trash

32
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,290
can content for the next 10 years and just slowly go down. If you tell me I peaked six months ago.

33
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:41,060
I've been doing this for 10 years. Wow. You peaked at the imposter is sus. But you're already doing

34
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:49,350
that. You have no idea what I have for this year. No, I- I'm- I'll- you know what? I bet you I peaked

35
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,230
this year. All right? I'll be honest with you. There's like three streams that are gonna happen

36
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,129
this year. That I- that absolutely I've peaked this year. Like this- I- there's nothing I can do

37
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:07,060
that- maybe next year. The next one to two years is the peak of my entire online internet thing.

38
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,800
So, you know, I'm not- I'm not- I'm not there yet. I will be soon though. And I- and I know- I know

39
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,660
when to see that. I know when to accept that. It's probably this year. It's not gonna be Catboy.

40
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:33,319
Imagine peaking at Catboy. God. All right, are you ready? Let's play. Let's do this. In a movie this

41
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:42,300
way. Foreign Finders. All right, something- wait, what's wrong with the audio? Is it supposed to

42
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:54,970
sound like this? Is it supposed to sound like that? Is this copyright? Oh no, it's- my connector is

43
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,350
fucked up. You wanna know something funny about how much of a lazy idiot I actually am? I have had-

44
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:09,269
now remember, these things are like a dollar fifty on Amazon. I have had a busted, um, you know,

45
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,029
like the- those little jacks that you plug in, like a headphone jack? I have a headphone jack

46
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:19,100
extender that I've had for four years and it has never worked. It's bad. There's something wrong

47
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,540
with the insides and I have to like juggle and jostle around the cord inside of this thing to

48
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,819
get it to make audio come through it. It's- it's probably two dollars on Amazon. I just- I just

49
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,879
won't do it. I don't know why. Are you sure you want to start- what do you mean, am I sure?

50
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:48,649
That just scared the shit out of me. That just was fucking terrifying. Juggles is back. All right,

51
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:59,930
so let's give this the actual time it deserves. I think I kind of look like this guy right now.

52
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:33,430
What do you do in this game? You buy and sell antiques. What? Are these characters?

53
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:49,639
Is that an Oscar? That was just an Oscar. Oh, can I get an- that's probably worth a lot of money.

54
00:07:50,439 --> 00:08:00,709
Oh shit, this is DMCA. Somewhere in America, 1991. No, largely similar to the real America,

55
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:09,560
but not quite. Imagine being concerned about DMCA with America. Wake up. Young and our generator

56
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:23,189
is down. Get a battery from our truck and fix it. Let's work awful hard. Our vacation awaits. Okay,

57
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:31,879
I might need to turn the sensitivity up just a little bit. 90 FOV. This guy didn't even play

58
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:45,879
Quake. Shut up. Okay, movement. Jump, look around, interact. Okay, so that's crouch.

59
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,919
So take a battery from your truck and place it in the generator. All right, you got it.

60
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,850
Do a funny voice. I just did one. Okay, I don't- well, I'm not gonna pick up the briefcase. Let's

61
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:05,639
go do the battery. This is a beautiful game. This looks good on my fucking 3090. Welcome to

62
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,539
Barn Finders. Get car battery from the car's trunk. Put it into the generator. Use your computer to

63
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:20,360
find jobs and travel all over America. All right, cool. Let's go get the battery from the truck.

64
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:41,259
Move this shit out of the way. Wait, you can throw? Hold on. Can I hurt anybody? No,

65
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:50,090
you can't hurt anybody. Never mind. It's a 1080. No, it's a 3090. Extra large. Okay,

66
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:59,110
so let's get the battery. Open the trunk here. Battery developed by Miku. This battery was

67
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,529
designed exclusively to power up Miku generators. Did you guys know that I thought that Miku,

68
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:12,409
like the singer, I thought that was a person up until about like three months ago, two months ago.

69
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:16,820
I thought Hatsune Miku was a person. I didn't think it was- I did not know that it was a robot.

70
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,110
I thought that was a singer and it was like a gorilla's scenario. I did- I did not know that.

71
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:35,159
I thought it was an actual human being singing songs. Wait, mark- to mark for transport, enter

72
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:44,379
study mode, rotate item, zoom in and out, mark for transport. Okay, place it in the generator.

73
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,679
She is real. She's real. All right, but I'm just saying, like, I thought it- I thought it was a

74
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,860
person, like somebody in, like, the booth. All right, check your computer for job email.

75
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:08,019
Are those guns? Why are there guns in this game? Oh man, the 3090 really brings out the

76
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:19,769
fucking foliage, let me tell you. All right, computer. It's better than the gorillas.

77
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:31,500
I just- I don't know if I can agree with you. Well, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Do you

78
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:39,100
mean like gorillas from like 2000- gorillas from like 2000 to like 2015? Or do you mean- what do

79
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,779
you mean? What are you talking about? Like, which one? It's a dirty computer. All right, email.

80
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,580
On red. A naughty stag for a friend. Hello, barn finders. Can you help an old friend?

81
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,470
So I heard there's still a naughty stag at the old red barn. Maybe you could find it there for you.

82
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:07,750
There's money in it if you do. 300 bucks to find an old stag? Okay. At the old red barn. Barn hub.

83
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:19,929
Okay, there's the old- there's the red barn. Travel is one gas or by gas. All right, so I have

84
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:29,500
to go to the red barn. Barnhub.com. Why the- why do people do this? This is- like, everything has

85
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:41,820

88
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:08,820
sell stuff here. Not fall guys. Yeah, no, it's not fall guys. Sorry, I'm not playing fall guys.

89
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:19,669
Okay, go to the truck. Do I have a map? I don't. Do I not have a map? Is this basketball? Basketball

91
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,830

97
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:25,460

98
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,340
in like middle school i was on like a bath the basketball team like the after school basketball

99
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:35,059

100
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:42,179
high school so they never gave me the ball because i was not very good but i always so badly wanted

101
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,440
just to like drain a three so badly it was like the good player that got the ball every fucking

102
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,120
time and he was the person that scored like 40 points because all the kids don't you don't

103
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,539

104
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:03,419
i got the ball one time and it was the only time and i got up selfishly like there was a big rebound

105
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,580
off the um off like the the backward and i just it came to me and it was like oh pass it to the

151
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:53,559
that's not a game show or a soap opera what are you watching sponge bob no television there's

152
00:23:53,559 --> 00:24:02,809
nothing on tv anymore all these networks it's just it's so weird i don't even know why cable

153
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,859
fucking tv even exists anymore every network now just plays shit that people liked 10 years ago

154
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:15,380
and has one or two shows that are actually in current airing schedules at like eight o'clock

155
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:27,589
at night what's the point of having a tv network what's that key i really just don't get it now

156
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:31,779
that's what is that thing no no no study it study it i want to see it it's like a frog on a bike

157
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:40,490
i want to see it whatever because you know everybody wants streaming services and i saw

158
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,259
this coming from a mile away i'm the only one that said this i'm the only person that made this point

159
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,059
i'm the only one that you know that said this i knew that every single fucking company was going

160
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:55,420
to make their own streaming service so it used to be like one two hundred three hundred plus

161
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,390
dollars a month to have like all the cable channels oh i want hbo i want showtime i want

162
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:08,619
uh food network i want the big package so now to get the big package everybody has their own

163
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:14,180
streaming service so what ends up happening is you have like seven active monthly subscriptions

164
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,259
to get the shows you want to watch so it's just one to two hundred dollars a month anyways because

165
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:26,380
all the cable companies decided oh let's make our own apps and charge 12 dollars a month i'm the

166
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:36,380
only person that said that all right wait there's probably something valuable in here all right i

444
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:15,319
from attack on titan it's armin very concerned about erin and it's like the way he says it every

445
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:19,800
like three episodes every every single episode i don't do i need i don't need to if you don't

446
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:48,939
watch the show how am i gonna explain that to you you watch it dubbed yes i do and oh

447
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:58,229
oh he watches a show dubbed oh he doesn't watch it in subs listen i have such hard time paying

448
01:24:58,229 --> 01:25:05,460
attention that reading while watching a show is hard for me to do because i can't pay attention

449
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,739
to what's actually going on on the screen i'm too busy reading the text at the bottom so i'm just

450
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:16,439
kind of reading and not watching that's it i know the subs have probably a million times better

451
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:27,060
but it doesn't matter for me it's like if you had the book of the show you were watching

452
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:33,880
and you were reading the book at the same time that the show was being played at the same point

453
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:40,060
in the story like looking down reading like you're reading the same dialogue look up okay that's

454
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,819
happening read down look down read the same dialogue or look up it's like just reading the

455
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:57,369
book while the show is happening i can't do it my brain is not smart enough that's a bad analogy no

456
01:25:57,369 --> 01:26:08,810
it's not because i'm literally reading what's happening on the screen all right let's go i'm

457
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:15,289
gonna buy the other gas are we almost at the two hour mark is it time to play stocks game

463
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:41,590
they're reading the subtitles imagine if they just had their eyes down like looking on the

464
01:27:41,590 --> 01:28:04,220
bottom of the screen reading like the actual animated characters agent i'm detecting strong

was this law there was a locked door somewhere what was it right here right shit oh oh oh single

548
01:44:54,949 --> 01:45:02,039
google searches i have a key for the second house i think this is for the second house

549
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:14,739
off eating soap of chocolate is so good yeah i know the person sitting on the couch

550
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:19,939
they're in pajamas they take one bite and it zooms into their face and then it tell them

551
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:27,050
it goes to like a part where they're like on a cloud and they're floating around and then it

552
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:30,489
shows them how relaxed they are up in the clouds and then it comes back and they have like the

553
01:45:30,489 --> 01:45:38,229
chocolate and they just have this big smile while they're sitting on the couch all right let's go

554
01:45:38,869 --> 01:46:02,310
all right found it still items here coaster microwave or whatever it is

555
01:46:02,869 --> 01:46:10,899
i've been brainwashed by big chocolate you know it's also interesting to think about

556
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:19,029
so back like 60 or 70 years ago they would do commercials like i'm sure a lot of people know

557
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:23,989
this already but cigarettes were seen as not a big deal at all they were seen as like a healthy

558
01:46:23,989 --> 01:46:30,600
snack there was a commercial i remember watching where it was like a doctor writing a note about

559
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:37,060
how like i think chester uh what was the name of the company chesterfield cigarettes are the

560
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:42,380
healthiest of all the cigarettes they don't produce any throat irritation it was a doctor

561
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:48,140
sitting there writing a note talking it was like a doctor's note about how they were healthy and it

562
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:52,779
made me think about people like 50 60 years ago thought like cigarettes were just like fun like

563
01:46:52,779 --> 01:46:58,539
candy that didn't hurt you what are we eating now what are we doing now that like a hundred years

564
01:46:58,539 --> 01:47:03,739
from now people are going to watch old youtube ads for like some product and go holy fucking

565
01:47:03,979 --> 01:47:10,890
they were eating this all the time they thought this was fine what's wrong what are they insane

566
01:47:11,449 --> 01:47:17,210
i wonder what that thing is going to be where it's like it's it is unbelievable to think that

567
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:29,399
we were eating this chocolate fast food sugar i don't think it's going to be sugar because

568
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:36,699
sugar is like sugar has a function it's like one of the most it's like the building block

569
01:47:36,699 --> 01:47:41,689
of a ton of things everybody already knows sugar is really not good for you at all

570
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:48,579
we already know that people thought cigarettes were fine and they're like horrendous for you

571
01:47:48,579 --> 01:47:54,020
what's the thing that we all think is fine right now or good that we're like no everything that's

572
01:47:54,020 --> 01:48:12,010
perfectly fine but it's not at all oil like vegetable oil probably micro plastics interesting

573
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:27,659
i even use the key i don't know what do i even care i got the golden paper it's going to be

574
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:34,970
like the fake sugar is like stevia you know actually i would not be surprised like i don't

575
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:39,050
know something about that right it's like wait okay what if like 100 years from now it's like

576
01:48:39,050 --> 01:48:53,449
wait they were making fake sugar garlic hmm now that would be very sad caffeine i could see

577
01:48:53,449 --> 01:49:00,390
caffeine having some kind of like wow i can't believe they were doing that garlic oh man imagine

578
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:03,989
if it was garlic that would be sad because we think garlic is wicked healthy for you and there's

579
01:49:03,989 --> 01:49:14,180
like studies about it i've seen a doctor write a note about garlic before oh i want another big

580
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:23,930
one here these old cigarette commercials they're so fascinating i recommend you go watch them

581
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,220
they used to say that like having the filter on a cigarette like filtered cigarettes filter out all

582
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:35,260
the disgusting stuff it filters out the tar so you get a clean smooth drag those things those

583
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:45,939
things don't even do anything the invention of the filter cigarette was so it's such a huge

584
01:49:45,939 --> 01:50:12,729
advertising thing clean smoke yeah 105 anything dirty oh i need to wash it no i can't watch a

585
01:50:12,729 --> 01:50:24,579
cigarette commercial i'm not 18 yet why you what are you doing here you had to click the button

02:04:51,529 --> 02:05:06,779
like it i bet you a bunch of you actually really like it i think it's funny probably uh first two

651
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:12,460
seasons maybe what is a funny show that's right now i think have i asked this before what do you

652
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:19,180
what is like the collective like twitch chat hive mind opinion on what's a currently airing good

653
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:33,380
show that's funny that's really funny sopranos has not aired in like 15 years probably erin

654
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:42,180
currently erin invincible is actually a good show is it okay i want i want everybody to remember

655
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:50,979
this i want you all to remember this clip this and in like two or three years i want to see if like

656
02:05:50,979 --> 02:06:02,199
everybody hates that show now okay remind me in like three years if like everybody thinks the show

657
02:06:02,199 --> 02:06:11,300
is not funny because it looks like of all of you most of you are saying it is this dipping sauce

658
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:27,460
yeah just wait for the just wait for the dipping sauce episode young sheldon uh i have to like

659
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:36,199
i have to try to get this whatever i'm gonna lose it though i'm gonna try whatever let's go

660
02:06:36,199 --> 02:06:58,359
just wait till the last second to do a 50 dollar bid wait 450 nobody there's so many how many

661
02:06:58,359 --> 02:07:03,670
people there's so many people here and nobody's bidding why would you come to the auction did i

662
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:49,380
just get this house for 450 i did why did you even show up oh god damn it no what do you mean i

663
02:07:49,380 --> 02:08:01,100
can't do this level now i just wasted a bunch of money the secret is to let them bid and then

664
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:08,170
come into the last second no the secret is to go to the auction go there kind of late and disheveled

665
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:14,260
because something just happened crazy and you sort of irritate everybody in the room you sit down

666
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:21,109
you're like oh sorry about that and then your character ends up sneezing like three or fourths

667
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:25,909
of the way like about maybe two-thirds of the way through the auction and they see that as a bid

668
02:08:26,939 --> 02:08:32,300
and it's like oh my god that's so much money i can't believe what the heck oh my god it's sold

669
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:37,579
to the man in the funny hat and then i have to pay like five million dollars because i i didn't

670
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:57,819
mean to bid that's what you meant to say did this happen no this is every this is i don't have the

671
02:08:57,819 --> 02:09:14,279
clock that happens in every tv show that has an auction one of the characters like sneezes and

672
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:21,699
they they put their hand up accidentally somehow that's mr bean yeah it's in every tv show that's

673
02:09:21,699 --> 02:09:26,460
ever had an auction if you have an auction in your show the main character is going to accidentally

674
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:30,220
do something and raise their hand and have to buy like the 20 million dollar painting

792
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:59,819
the new alvin and the chipmunks 3d cartoon but they're desperately trying to make alvin and the

793
02:40:59,819 --> 02:41:04,860
chipmunks something that people want to watch by making them like little kids they're not even

794
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:10,489
chipmunks anymore they're like as big as small children and they have like people faces the both

795
02:41:10,489 --> 02:41:15,290
the movies sucked i don't think anybody cared nobody watched either one of those movies they

796
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:19,620
did horribly at the box office i think and they were very very poorly rated we have to have like

797
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:26,920
a show on nickelodeon about them i can't think of anything else i don't i can't think of anyone

798
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:33,260
that watches that show like alvin and the chipmunks is one of those old nostalgia things that

799
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:41,450
no one cares about and now i have to watch that show instead because you've ruined twin peaks for

800
02:41:41,450 --> 02:41:50,870
me thank you you have no idea alvin the last episode that i just watched simon was on his

801
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:55,829
computer and he had a big report due that was due for his class because they're like in school i

802
02:41:55,829 --> 02:42:02,600

803
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:06,760
gotta do all this code and alvin grabbed the computer and wrote an email to the professor

804
02:42:08,139 --> 02:42:11,670
saying like simon said this and that and that and like hit the send button

805
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:16,549
and like he's like yeah he should know and simon's like what are you doing alvin are you crazy

806
02:42:16,549 --> 02:42:23,430

time for that aim the bid wars wait what i want to go to the bid wars oh i need money first

858
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:21,100
is fable 2 going to be a two-part stream that's probably going to be yeah probably saturday and

859
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:29,270
sunday resident evil will be two streams and then so will the other one able to is going to

860
02:57:29,270 --> 02:57:35,590
definitely take more than one stream to do what about the diablo 2 remaster well i plan on playing

861
02:57:35,590 --> 02:57:44,840
the diablo 2 remaster um on my own to i don't think i'm going to stream that it depends i

862
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:55,340
don't think so resident evil village is like four hours well if i beat resident evil village quickly

863
02:57:55,340 --> 02:58:05,690
then i'll just play fable 2 i don't think this is going to happen if a game says four or five

864
02:58:05,690 --> 02:58:21,780
hours it takes me about 10 it's like took me about nine yeah i would imagine it's like the other ones

865
02:58:24,969 --> 02:58:31,959
i did how is it i didn't even ask how the game is it looks like it's getting good reviews so

866
02:58:31,959 --> 02:58:36,280
resident evil 2 the remaster was probably my favorite resident evil it was my it was my

867
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:53,659
game of the year how can that is it first person or is it third person it's first person oh shit

868
02:58:53,659 --> 02:59:10,059
okay that's actually all right that's cool so it's like it's essentially resin it's essentially

869
02:59:10,059 --> 02:59:21,879
resident evil 7 oh shit all right just so lots of sex in the game which won't allow it to be played

870
02:59:22,120 --> 02:59:32,819
major t.o.s violations don't risk it what i mean don't risk it how many isn't it like a hundred

871
02:59:32,819 --> 02:59:40,950
thousand people streaming that game right now it's like almost all of twitch is streaming that

872
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:53,860
i think they would probably you're fine i know i'm fine i didn't have a i'm fine i'll be fine

873
02:59:53,860 --> 03:00:24,489
don't listen to that guy okay they all got banned t.o.s timmy's you're not gonna like

874
03:00:24,489 --> 03:00:42,620
resident evil 8 don't play it i liked resident evil 7 well i liked resident alien i liked some

875
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:48,090
of resident evil 7 i liked portions of it the first hour the first two hours of resident evil

876
03:00:48,090 --> 03:00:56,360
7 was a nine out of ten second like four hours was like a six oh like the last four hours was

877
03:00:56,360 --> 03:01:14,280
like a two so i mean i don't know the first like few hours of that game were some of the best

878
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:24,299
i think they've ever done that house was scary that was terrifying and then resident evil 2 just

879
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:31,209
nothing can be better than resident evil 3's remake it'd be hard to do because resident evil

880
03:01:31,209 --> 03:01:47,899
3's remake was very much uh like very lackluster they're gonna remake resident evil 4 i'm really

881
03:01:47,899 --> 03:01:55,159
scared of that that terrifies me because resident evil 4 is still really good the reason to remake

882
03:01:55,159 --> 03:02:01,799
2 and 3 makes sense because they're like old tank controlled top town just go turn turn turn

883
03:02:01,799 --> 03:02:09,659
go go go resin evil 4 is still a great game doesn't really need to be remade what do they

884
03:02:09,659 --> 03:02:20,100
have to like change remake 4 in first person i don't think i would like that i think i'd want

885
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:37,579
it to be in third person they're adding tomato town to resident evil 4 you know there are so many

886
03:02:37,579 --> 03:02:43,270
there's so many zoomers now i wouldn't be surprised and that and that would be like okay i guess

887
03:02:43,270 --> 03:03:02,180
they're adding like tomato town there's a lot of zoomers i mean and they love tomato town i didn't

888
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:08,020
say uh tomato town is dumb fortnight is dumb zoomers stupid i didn't say that i just said

889
03:03:08,020 --> 03:03:13,379
zoomers love tomato town would it be that surprising if tomato town was in something else that wasn't

890
03:03:13,379 --> 03:03:29,739
just fortnight our zoomers love tomato town all right let's do it again yeah that's a lot of money

891
03:03:29,739 --> 03:03:43,510
how much is that 1800 i don't even know what tomato town looks like all right i got 4200 bucks i'm

892
03:03:43,510 --> 03:04:12,469
going to bid wars let's go bid wars i have five thousand dollars let's go bid wars you're missing

893
03:04:12,469 --> 03:04:21,239

894
03:04:21,239 --> 03:04:37,959
