1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:16,949
I am back. Decided to take the opportunity to make another tea. Refill the beverage a little bit

2
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:29,500
here. And now we're going to play Breath of the Wild. It looks like the switch... I don't think

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:47,450
the switch even turned off, if I'm completely honest. Let me see here. Yeah, I don't think the

4
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:55,429
switch even turned off. Is this the... this is the exact screen that I was on, right? Did I just go

5
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:03,000
to sleep or something? I don't know. That's weird. All right, bear with me for a second because I have

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:19,799
to do some audio changes here. I have to delay my voice and the camera. Give me one second. Like this.

7
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:44,780
Hello, hello, hello! Okay. Okay, that should do it. Now, should I delay? I gotta delay the switch

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:57,140
audio by a little bit, right? We'll do a test. It's not working. It's not ready yet. One second,

9
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,739
hold on. I gotta refresh the camera. Gotta plug in headphones. Are you losing viewers? That's all

10
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:11,060
right. No, that doesn't matter. That's fine. I don't care. I mean, people want to watch Breath

11
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,099
of the Wild. They want to watch Breath of the Wild. They don't watch any fart trombone game. They

12
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,580
don't want to watch this. That's up to them. That's fine. Hey, don't worry about the view count. It's

13
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:40,949
all right. I don't care. Why didn't they stay? Why did they fucking stay? They should have stayed.

14
00:02:41,669 --> 00:03:04,099
Whatever. Okay. Headphones are in. I believe I am ready to play Breath of the Wild. Change the input

15
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:15,939
on my screen. All right, let's go. Let's do a test here really quickly. If I go like this,

16
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:31,960
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. We good? Seems pretty good. All right.

17
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,740
I'm going to turn this up a little for you guys because it's a little low for me.

18
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:49,930
How do I do that? There we go. Okay. I'm ready. So what was the last thing I did?

19
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:08,979
Is it too loud? Is it just right? I had a bunch of shit marked. All right, we can do this thing.

20
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:19,699
Audio is good. Is it fine? Okay. Oh, the face cam has to move too, yo. That's right. How's

21
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:26,860
this in a good spot? Turn this down. I feel like this is bright as hell. Why is this so bright?

22
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:42,329
Too bright. How come you look like the Hulk? It's actually kind of a compliment. All right,

23
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:50,860
let's go. So I wanted to kill one of the guardians, wherever that is, but maybe I'll do the Zora thing.

24
00:04:50,860 --> 00:05:04,819
Oh, that's right. I'm never around the horse. The horse is never available.

25
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:32,839
Zora quest is related. Okay. So let me fast travel over here then. Look at the motorcycle.

26
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:49,160
There's an instant horse TP item near the second stable. Maybe one day I'll get it. Chat, shut up.

27
00:05:50,199 --> 00:06:01,899
Wait, I... Oh, oops. Chat, shut up. Don't tell them that. Well, sorry. I got that info now,

28
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:15,660
don't I? This is not Shadow of Mordor, which by the way, what a great game. I was about to just

29
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:25,209
jump off and I thought for some reason it was going to be like... No, that's not how it works.

30
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,310
Isn't... Monolith is making a Wonder Woman game, right? I can't wait for a new Monolith game.

31
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,529
That's going to be so good. Okay. So how do I get down from here without... Oh, wait, I have

32
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:58,329
the glider. It's been like a week. What am I talking about? You say who cares? I mean,

33
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:05,939
Monolith made the two Shadow of War and Shadow of Mordor. That'll be their first game since Shadow

34
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:18,620
of War. All right, let's move. What do I have for weapons equipped right now? Look at all this cool

35
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:33,189
shit I have. I don't know when to use it. Did you like Shadow of War? I streamed Shadow of War

36
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:40,089
for like three or four hours. I think I streamed it one day. I honestly don't think it was more

37
00:07:40,089 --> 00:08:16,279
than four hours. That was just odd. That was very odd. I dropped it? How do I throw this?

38
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:32,230
What the fuck just happened? How do I throw... I... All right, I got to get back into this.

39
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:45,590
It's like all the buttons are different. Yeah, that's right. The throw button. Okay.

40
00:08:46,309 --> 00:09:18,740
All the buttons are different. Oh, my God. There's so many of them. I can't just sit on

41
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:55,830
these forever. I have to use these now. I use the spear. Jesus. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

42
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:20,809
All right, that's two down. You idiot. I want a bow. Do I have any arrows? How do I not have any

43
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:48,840
arrows? I got the frame rate. All right, that's good. Only one more. I'm good. We got it. That's

44
00:10:48,840 --> 00:11:00,039
a good bow. Are they protecting an unlocking chest or something? I don't see anything. I saw

45
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:23,080
one earlier. Oh, you cannot point blank me, right? It's broken. Fuck. This shit's broken.

46
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,950
I don't want to use these weapons. I need something else. Did they drop anything else?

47
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:46,169
Shock arrow. Yeah, well, that's better. What the fuck is going on?

48
00:11:46,169 --> 00:12:09,720
This happened before. I don't know what it did. What does this do? Does this respawn every enemy?

49
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:22,940
It respawns to every single one. I just went through all this bullshit

50
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:40,200
and I have to do this again. Oh, come on. All right, I'm getting the hell out of here.

51
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,379
I'm just getting out. There was a chest here, but I don't even want it anymore.

52
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:59,610
I don't. I don't want this. All right, we're good. There's like a warthog or something there,

53
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:13,139
but I don't care. Head over here. He's learning the wrong way. What do you mean?

54
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:30,470
I'm trying to go here. Oh, this turned out to be actually the wrong way. You're right.

55
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:42,200
Don't fall off and die in the waterfall, please. Is there any way to? I can get up there. It's

56
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:56,870
raining, but it's okay. Let me try getting up there. I think there's enough places for me to stop.

57
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:05,590
Yeah, I should be fine. Move this microphone a little bit closer to my mouth.

58
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:33,379
I think I'm all right. Impatient. You dope. Wait, the Blood Moon is sort of a memory clear

59
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,980
for the Switch. It basically resets all enemies and areas that you've affected in gameplay,

60
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:46,870
so the Switch doesn't have to keep storing that info in RAM. Really? That's kind of wow. Okay.

61
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:58,100
I can't climb this because it just rains here permanently. There's got to be a place I can get

62
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:20,019
up here. Even just to jump up there and then stop. I'll try it. I'll try it once. This is

63
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:30,149
impossible. I was going to go the other way. I was going to go around the whole thing. All right.

64
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:35,669
Fine. I thought I could just be a skip Andy and just jump over that and climb it and jump over.

65
00:15:40,169 --> 00:16:04,019
Okay. You missed. No, this is plus plus. We just want regular. Okay. This one's just regular.

66
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:33,879
No skipping. One of those little dudes. The frog got away too. Come on. Radish. Where does

67
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:51,179
this person even come from? Fuck. Okay. This is defense boost. I think I'm just going to eat this

68
00:16:51,179 --> 00:17:00,149
or maybe this is just the steak. I'll be all right. Radish is a really, this is great. These are

69
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:08,329
awesome. You did a circle. I know, but I know, but I just trying to skip. I was trying to skip.

70
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:30,250
Okay. Just stay on the road. I was trying to skip. Don't eat those radishes. Don't eat them. Why not?

71
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:38,619
I'm a raw radish guy. I don't want cooked radishes. I want them raw. I want them rinsed.

72
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,900
Then I want to just cut the ends off and I want to put the whole, just crunch the whole thing.

73
00:17:42,619 --> 00:18:08,019
Okay. Now I can skip like a moron. What's wrong with the raw radishes? Okay. A raw radish is

74
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:28,650
my favorite vegetable without a doubt. Anybody under here? No, they're good. They are. They're

75
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,680
amazing. You're a freak. I don't, I don't know. I think that raw radishes are the best. Call me

76
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,470
weirdo if you want. What about pickled radishes? Those are S tier. I think anything radishes are

77
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:56,789
S tier. A pretty bush. All right. What's in the way here? Is it going to fall? All right. So now

78
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:02,410
it's going to stay on the road. No, I don't want to watch the, I don't want to watch the hero

79
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:39,259
playthrough. We'll watch that later. What is this? What the fuck? This is boomerang. I just,

80
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm standing. Get out of the water. Get out of the water, out of the water, out of the water,

81
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:01,619
out of the water, out of the water, stuff sliding down the mountain. Oh my God. What just fucking

82
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:19,000
hit me? I dropped something. What was it? I dropped a shield. I severely overestimated how

83
00:20:19,000 --> 00:21:07,079
far I had to shoot that. These guys suck. All right. Hold on. I don't. Ooh, that's a good boomerang.

84
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:32,460
All right. Where's my bow? Well, I was going to say where's the ding? All right. Give me all this

85
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:54,440
shit back. All right. Do not stand in water. 24. Okay. That's actually really good. Don't throw

86
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:27,609
this. Okay. We're good. Floaty dusty thing over here. All right. Hold on. Ooh, nice. A shield. The

87
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:32,619
shield is great. This thing's got like 28 or something, right? Okay. I gotta go that way.

88
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:42,380
I'm imagining I probably have to cross the bridge, right? So no skip Andy here.

89
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Tom Scott. This water is electrified. It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.

90
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:17,670
Good callback from a few hours ago. All right. I'm across the bridge.

91
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:28,839
I'm physically incapable of backseating. Oh, look. Look below. Look down here.

92
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:41,430
They're everybody's favorite character. You're pretty far off. I was sure you'd be passing over

93
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,440
this bridge. So I've been waiting for you. You will be in Zora's domain before you know it.

94
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,910
In fact, I'm going to head that way to meet you there. Whoa, link. Beware warrior. A monster

95
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:33,750
approaches from behind you. Wait, would you we're doing this? Okay. Annihilated. I haven't seen a

96
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:54,809
shrine pop up. Like my favorite part of the whole game. Staying on the road. There isn't one here.

97
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:08,549
Oh, that's all right. I have to cook some food. All I have is food that doesn't heal me. It just

98
00:25:08,549 --> 00:26:33,769
gives me 10 minutes of buzzing around. Oh, nice. This is a deer. I mean, I got Hyrule herb. This

99
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:44,140
healthy herb grows abundantly in the plains of Hyrule. Cook it. So where's the first guardian?

100
00:26:44,140 --> 00:27:17,539
First guardian was up here, right? This kind of general area. I'll do that after. Do I have a

101
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:29,160
health potion or something? Drink the milk. Eat the raw meat. I think I was to eat one of these.

102
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:36,099
I mean, I cooked them for this very purpose. Mid-level resistance to electricity. All right,

103
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm going to drink that and then I'm going to eat something that has. I mean, I cooked it for a

104
00:27:44,920 --> 00:28:06,869
reason. I'm going to eat it. I cooked it for a reason. Oh, I'll take the lightning rod. That

105
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:30,740
sounds fucking awesome. Oh, all right. This is fun. Cool. I want to use. I got to keep going.

106
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:56,650
I got to utilize this. I got to take the look at this fucking road. You just use the direct path.

107
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:12,680
I don't like direct paths. I want to be able to climb a wall and jump over. I like to climb over

108
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:21,880
a wall, jump and fall and take 80% of my HP and skip five minutes of walking. I've been. I'm like

109
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:49,000
that in every game. You miss something? What did I miss? I don't see anything. Big shiny wall.

110
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:53,619
I looked at that the first one. I didn't think anything was significant with it.

111
00:29:53,619 --> 00:30:05,529
I thought I could climb it. Did I look at it? Didn't I look at the other one?

112
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:21,029
Okay, I didn't want to click it again. I just whatever. All right. So a hundred years ago,

113
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:26,230
King Dorofan ascended to the throne. A stray guardian crossed Upland Zorana into our domain.

114
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,769
The guardian seemed unstoppable. It was then that our King Dorofan, without a thought for his own

115
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:36,599
safety, came out to face the guardian himself. With supernatural strength, he lifted the guardian

116
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:42,039
and hurled it into a ravine. The impact of the fall left the guardian pieces and was never to

117
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:46,440
trouble another Zora ever again. Citizens celebrated the king's valor from then on. Their trust and

118
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,720
respect for him grew beyond compare. You can still see the scar he earned that day in his forehead.

119
00:30:51,720 --> 00:31:02,940
A token of his triumph. What are you reading? There's a lot of people here, right? There's a

120
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,950
lot of people here. I'll read the lore for the people that are here. Harry Potter? No.

121
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:29,740
You skipped all that boring shit. I'm gonna just tell you right now. Um, you be careful

122
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:42,950
saying boring and Zelda in the same sentence. I don't, I don't think I would do that. Headshot.

123
00:31:43,589 --> 00:32:05,539
Headshot. Well, I mean, it's just not true. Okay. Cricket. I don't play Zelda games.

124
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:12,019
This is the first Zelda game I played in a two, almost two decades. I think this is really fun.

125
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:20,599
All right. What do I have for weapons? What do I need? Okay. I've got, what's this crap?

126
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:47,799
Yeah, drop this. There we go. That's better. All right. Can I do this? Yeah, I can. Shrine?

127
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:58,539
I thought you guys said there wasn't a shrine here. To be fair, text-based lore in most games is

128
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:05,339
boring. Put it in dialogue or something. Um, text-based lore is interesting for extra,

129
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,740
right? It's cool to be like, oh, you know, I could read this if I wanted to. I'll read it if I feel

130
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:20,819
like it. I never, I genuinely never read, um, text-based lore. I just kind of don't. It's not

131
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:37,059
that I don't appreciate it. It's just I, my brain just wants to move. I've been waiting for you,

132
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:44,099
Link. Welcome. Behold the pride of my people, Zora's Domain. Now I shall introduce you to the king.

133
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:58,730
Hurry this way. I tried to not have the cam come on before I like the hard

134
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,740
blink, but I caught it because the cam is delayed by like a thousand milliseconds. So I caught it

135
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:19,260
at the wrong time. So you saw it. The shrine's right in front of me. I don't care about anything

136
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:44,840
else but this. He loves his shrines. I really do. I like the shrines because they're these complete

137
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:54,409
just total episodes of content. Just go in, do the task. It's a small area and then leave.

138
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:25,909
I like it. Interesting. Pushing power. So what's the goal? I can walk up here? Okay.

139
00:35:25,909 --> 00:36:00,940
What am I trying to do? Zora's Spear. How much damage does this thing do? Oh my god. Get rid of

140
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:20,710
this. All right. Push. Push stuff. The goal is to get the balls. I don't know. I'm going to check

141
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,469
this place out first. There it is. Okay. So I got to get that ball into Link. You can definitely

142
00:36:26,469 --> 00:37:46,070
climb that. I think there is, Link, there is no way you can't get up there. How do I turn this on?

143
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,469
Oh, I have to get one of these. Okay. All right. All right. I get it. For some reason,

144
00:37:50,469 --> 00:39:12,199
I thought I had to get that one in there and not any of these ones. No! Give me that. Give me that.

145
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:33,659
Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that fucking thing. What the fuck are you doing?

146
00:39:33,659 --> 00:40:05,019
Why does this hurt? Defense. Does this have to come to a complete stop? It has to come to a

147
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:12,699
complete stop before I don't get hurt. I mean, this is going to work. It's going to go in there

148
00:40:12,699 --> 00:42:16,519
and it's going to work. I could have just done this. Why did it explode? Why did it explode?

149
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:31,829
No, no, no. I know. But hold on. No, you fucking idiot. Get out of the way. There it is.

150
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm just trying to whatever this I'm doing this the wrong way. But okay. I don't care if you

151
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,880
backseat, but confirm. I have to get one of those balls in there to drop the other ball. Or is it

152
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:04,329
just get the ball at the top that's orange in there? The ball that at the top and orange,

153
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:07,610
the only one that's supposed to go in there. Is that correct? Or do I have to get one in there

154
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:51,400
to make the ball drop? I don't know what you're saying. Yes, too. I got it. Okay. So you have to

155
00:43:51,400 --> 00:44:21,079
get this out of her. This shit is stuck in now. Do not free chat. Keep them. Keep them locked in

156
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:40,940
here. Thank you. All right. Get the fuck out of there. I definitely have to block this with ice.

157
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:53,880
That's very clear. That's blocked. How do I move that? You know, what would have been a smart idea

158
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:04,860
was to just walk up here. I didn't even check to see if I could even go up here. I should just

159
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:10,460
walked up here. I looked up and I was like, Oh, yeah, I don't know about that. That's true. Yeah.

160
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:18,730
I think I have to do what am I doing? Just go with walk up and look. Okay. How do I actually

161
00:45:18,730 --> 00:46:11,940
move this though? Dude with like an arrow? Move the fucking thing. What the fuck can I move this

162
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:42,420
for? Link, stop getting glued to every object that's around you. Okay. So I thought that was

163
00:46:42,659 --> 00:47:24,969
just like a nice like spa entrance. I didn't know that I could whatever. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.

164
00:47:24,969 --> 00:48:41,980
Oh shit. I'm fine. Oh, no, no, no. This way, this way, this way. Okay. That should be fine,

165
00:48:41,980 --> 00:50:17,800
right? Oh, shut up. All right. So the issue here is I did it too hard, but I'm trying to just get

166
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:26,260
it to drop here instead. I have to move it over this. Okay. That's what I'm doing. That's the

167
00:50:26,260 --> 00:51:01,239
plan. I'm making it go that way. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I want it to go that

168
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:32,539
way, how? I got to block this. Block this shit right now. Now it's not going to go. All right.

169
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:39,769
That's it. It's going to end up down here. But get the, get rid of this fucking thing. Get out of

170
00:51:39,769 --> 00:53:28,250
here. You're going to mess up everything. Get out of here. All right. Let him out. This person's like,

171
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:36,900
that shrine took me three times as long as it should have. That was painful.

172
00:53:36,900 --> 00:54:06,199
That took an ungodly amount of time. All right. What's the score IGN? You don't know what you're,

173
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:23,769
you don't know what you're talking about. All right. That was fun. You're a, you're a

174
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:38,630
Germaniac today. So this is, okay. So now we're here. So we're in the Zora domain. Very cool. Yeah.

175
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:43,110
Some puzzles are harder than others for people. Some, look, maybe I'm better at the combat stuff

176
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:48,199
than you. Maybe I'm better at some of the other puzzles than you. Maybe you're better than me at

177
00:54:48,199 --> 00:55:06,860
some of the other puzzles. But you aren't though. That's you saying that. I literally did this a

178
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:15,289
week or two ago during the 14 hour stream. That's what I did at that 10 hour mark.

179
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:23,800
I did that. Remember? That's what I did. Oh, you don't have any fins. Are you Hylian?

180
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:37,909
I'm the president of Prince Sidon's fan club. My name is Tula. Do you know Prince Sidon?

181
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:43,849
Oh, I see. Ah, Prince Sidon. Just thinking of you turns me to mush. On the other hand,

182
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:51,139
if that pack of geezers shows up again, I swear. Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, Prince Sidon is a man with

183
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,300
magnificent ideas. Oh, I know. Why don't you go and have a chat with Prince Sidon? Yes, do.

184
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:37,610
I just lapped you three times. Oh, stuff! Is this a pool? You're sleeping in the pool.

185
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:54,949
That's bad, isn't it? Oh wait, aren't they, they have gills. Okay, never mind. They're fish. Yeah,

186
00:56:54,949 --> 00:57:18,170
I know. I just was, I don't know, I saw the Z's pretty up top singing. That first is freaking me

187
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:45,590
out. Ah, you must be the Hylian that Sidon brought here, correct? You did well to come all the way

188
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:53,940
here. I am King Dorofan, ruler of the Zora. Hmm, that object upon your waist. Is that not a Sheikah

189
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:02,489
slate? Hmm, now that I've gotten a good look at you, it's too clear who you are. You are the Hylian

190
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:09,750
champion, Link. They're not telling me you've forgotten me. The Hylian champion? You can't mean

191
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:15,610
the Link? That champion? So that's where I've heard your name before. What a fateful coincidence that

192
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:21,139
we should cross paths. I cannot believe it. The Hylian champion, Link, has appeared before us.

193
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:27,510
We have met numerous times, I'll have you know. Ah, so many memories. My mind is overflowing with

194
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:34,630
nostalgia, my friend. I had heard a terrible rumor that you had fallen in combat, but it appears you

195
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:45,719
managed to survive extraordinary. I've been sleeping. Oh, come again? Sleeping, you say. Hmm,

196
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:51,260
is that why you do not seem to remember me? Surely you must remember my precious daughter,

197
00:58:51,260 --> 00:59:02,780
Mipha, yes? You do, do you not? Mipha who? I cannot believe it. You've truly forgotten my dear Mipha

198
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:09,099
as well. You and Mipha were close, yet you do not remember her. Young hero, please look upon the

199
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:14,780
beauty of Zora's domain. Do you see that statue? Was gazing upon Mipha's immortalized form still

200
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:24,630
to not jog your memory? Well, perhaps your memory will return in time. I dearly hope so. Father,

201
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:30,199
I do not believe discussing my sister is helping matters at the moment. Link sees confused. Oh,

202
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,230
yes, of course. But first, is it worth noting how remarkable is that to see you? I can't,

203
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:48,599
I can never say your name right. Sidon. That's quite a feat, my boy. That's a good one. Link,

204
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:54,409
I doubt not that you have endured a great many trials. Still, I must ask you to hear my plea.

205
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:57,769
Now then, hero, I must inform you that Zora's domain is in danger of vanishing because of

206
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:04,329
divine beast Fa-Ruto. I shall do you the courtesy of speaking bluntly. We are alone,

207
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:15,500
and we can't stop it alone. Will you lend us your strength? What? King Dorven, my liege,

208
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,079
please do not speak so. Ask a Hylian for help. Why, the very thought of it curls my fins.

209
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:28,739
Muzu, I expected more of you. How can you still protest? Muzu, it's rude to speak that way to

210
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:34,550
your king and his guest. Link is here because I invited him. With such unprecedented rainfall,

211
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,619
we have no choice but to rely on the aid of a trustworthy Hylian. Have we not already

212
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:44,860
discussed this and arrived at that very conclusion? He's the key to saving Zora's domain. I have no

213
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,730
doubt in my mind. Indeed, Link is a champion, through and through. As things now stand in Zora's

214
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:56,519
domain, nay, perhaps all of Hyrule is doomed to be swallowed by the sea. This is bigger than all of

215
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,760
us, my friend. Zora and Hylian's alike. We must put aside our differences and band together.

216
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:07,019
Have you forgotten already, my king? We cannot trust these lowly Hylians. A hundred years ago,

217
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:10,860
they abused the power of an ancient civilization and turned Hyrule into what it is today.

218
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:23,400
And that is not the least of it. It is their fault that Lady Mipha was lost to us.

219
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:32,409
Took a long time for him to figure that out. Oh, Link. Divine Beast of Avrunda has great power.

220
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:37,480
It has the unique ability to create an endless supply of water. Of late, it has been mercilessly

221
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,480
spouting water into the air. As a result, this area has been plagued by heavy rains.

222
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:49,210
Can I flip them? I'm gonna flip them. They think it makes more sense to me to flip these.

223
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:55,750
For us Zora, water and air are as water. So you would not think this would be quite so critical

224
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:02,619
of a problem. Sadly, the rains have filled the eastern reservoir nearly to the point of flooding.

225
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:09,059
If the reservoir bursts, as it soon will, I fear immense damage will befall not only Zora's domain,

226
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:15,219
but also the area downstream from us. There, Hylian lives are in very grave danger.

227
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:51,800
Divine... oops. What is this place? It's like Bill Clinton. Whoa, look at this thing.

228
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:15,820
Divine Beast of Avrunda, your Princess Zelda, often studied the Divine Beasts. That is in the

229
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:22,170
time before the Great Calamity. According to her research, the orbs located on Avrunda's shoulders

230
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:27,769
are mechanisms that can control the water it generates. However, they require electricity

231
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:32,869
to work. These orbs are clearly out of control now because there's no electricity cursing through

232
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:39,349
to stop them. Now second, it was quite shock resistant for Zora. Hit one with a shock arrow,

233
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:45,800
sure enough, it slowed the water down a bit. Unfortunately, as an aquatic race, we Zora are

234
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,900
terribly vulnerable to the power of electricity. Perhaps because we could not safely strike it

235
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:56,019
with enough electricity at once, the water soon returned to its full force. That is why I went in

236
01:03:56,019 --> 01:04:00,760
search of a Hylian who could help us. Link, I'm certain you have already figured this out, but

237
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:06,940
we need you to use shock arrows to get those orbs working properly again. I will aid you in any way

238
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:12,780
that I can, of course. Please, Hero, I beg of you, help me stop Brutus' rampage of destruction.

239
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:22,860
What? Princess Zelda herself instructed you to board a Divine Beast and if he's from within?

240
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:30,659
So then Princess Zelda is still alive? Yes, in Hyrule Castle. I don't have a voice for Link.

241
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:35,400
I do not believe it. She was alive this whole time, just as you were. The events of a hundred

242
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,619
years ago cannot be altered if it is true, but if we can regain control of the Divine Beasts,

243
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:46,820
they may yet prove useful in sealing Calamity Ganon once and for all. I did not know they had

244
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:53,139
such grand ambitions, Link. Wondrous. Naturally, I shall help too. Once it has stopped rampaging,

245
01:04:53,139 --> 01:05:00,119
you can easily climb inside it. Come, Link, let us appease Ruta together. Thank you, Link.

246
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,880
Truly, we are in your debt. Our goal is the same. That means our meeting was nothing short of

247
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:14,179
destiny. Now then, allow me to offer you this gift of a sure fate. Zora Arbor! Custom arbor,

248
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:19,289
painstakingly crafted by each generation Zora Princess for her future husband. Wearing it will

249
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:25,369
give you the ability to swim up waterfalls. As long as you wear this, you can swim up waterfalls.

250
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:31,800
Just like I said, please take care of it. King Dorfen! Surely you do not really

251
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,550
intend to give this outsider a Zora armor. Countless generations of Zora Princesses have

252
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:41,960
gifted that armor to the one they have sworn to marry. Princess Mipha made that one there with

253
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:51,639
her own hands. It is far too important to entrust to a shady Hylian. He may be champion, but Mipha

254
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:57,289
had no such relationship with him, so why should he receive such an honor? This is just too much,

255
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:03,980
my liege. I do not understand it one bit. That ruseur is not easily swayed when his mind is set.

256
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:10,019
You must understand he was in charge of educating my dear daughter Mipha. Naturally,

257
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:17,269
she means a lot to him. Just as she means a lot to me and the world, too. Ever since we lost her to

258
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:25,269
the Calamity, he has grown despising. He grew up and he despised Hylians. I hope we can forgive

259
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:32,900
his rudeness. But what shall we do now? I tasked Muzu with finding the shock arrows we need to

260
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:43,960
appease Varuta. Now he has rushed off in a huff. Link, do not let his words concern you. I will

261
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:53,900
work this out with Muzu. I shall return shortly. Oh, here we go. Okay. I'm gonna head downstairs

262
01:06:53,900 --> 01:07:01,099
real quick. There we are. These are steep stairs. Sidon, I suppose that means you are going to tell

263
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:09,940
him. Link Muzu is most likely at the square down below. Do you mind going down there? I would

264
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:24,059
like you to try to speak with him. Somebody said down there was like a SpongeBob episode?

265
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:50,840
What? Awful joke. Oh, hold on. You came all the way here, but it was in vain. I have no desire

266
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:57,079
to speak with you. Listen well, Muzu. There's something you need to know. He who stands here,

267
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:03,400
the man called Link, is the one who my sister Mipha had feelings for. I was only a child,

268
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,940
so I did not know it myself at the time, but it is so. I grew up hearing my father tell stories,

269
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,940
some of which were about my sister's undying love for a Hylian named Link.

270
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:25,420
What? No! You cannot fool me with such a fanciful lie, not Miss Sora. How could Lady Mipha possibly

271
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:31,300
have feelings for a Hylian like him? The facts are clear. He remembers nothing. Even when he looks

272
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:38,460
upon Princess Mipha's statue. It's the truth, Muzu, though you never knew it. He was ever in Mipha's

273
01:08:38,460 --> 01:09:22,859
heart. I was thinking. This reminds me of the time. Well, I can't do it, but I'll show up.

274
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:31,289
You were just a reckless child, always getting yourself hurt at every turn. Every time,

275
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:42,340
I would heal you, just as I'm doing right now. Funny how, being a Hylian, you looked grown up

276
01:09:42,340 --> 01:10:06,729
so much faster than I did. I was always willing to heal your wounds, even back then. So if this

277
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:14,090
Calamity Ganon does in fact return, what can we really do? We just don't seem to know much

278
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:22,010
about what we'll be up against. But know this, that no matter how difficult this battle night gets,

279
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:31,609
if you, if anyone ever tries to do you harm, then I will heal you. No matter when,

280
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:38,460
or how bad the wound, I hope you know that I will always protect you.

281
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:46,489
Once this whole thing is over, maybe things can go back to how they used to be when we were young.

282
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:58,630
You know, perhaps we could spend some time together. All I'm saying is, I mean,

283
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:03,350
you give me a full suit of armor, a dagger, and three grenades, and I would do it. I'd be fine.

284
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:21,140
And like five bologna and cheese sandwiches, and I would, I would save the day here. I would do it

285
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:30,220
in three days. Okay.

286
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:10,810
Sorry, that was a long cutscene. I just need to run around the circle for a second. All right,

287
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:17,529
so I need to bring you proof that I know who this is. Step in fool lucky for us, we have proof.

288
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:21,609
Link, go ahead and show Muzu the Zora armor my father gave you. Wasn't he in the room?

289
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:28,550
Wait, wasn't this guy in the room when I got the armor? I want you to prove to me that you have,

290
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:35,579
that you knew who we are. Link, here's the armor. How would you get that? Oh, I like you. Wait,

291
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:53,159
I don't get it. I have to put it on? You were in the room when you want, when he gave it to me.

292
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:59,109
Oh, it has to activate. I get it. Okay. You really think changing your clothes is going to make me?

293
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:10,220
That's the Zora armor from before. It even made that by hand and it fits you perfectly.

294
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:18,779
What's the meaning of this? Now you understand, do you not? Now you know who her heart belonged

295
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:26,460
to and who she made this special armor for. Oh my goodness. How could it be another men's small?

296
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:36,329
No way. It's impossible. I don't know how. Now the fact that this armor fits Link perfectly should

297
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:42,329
be made proof that Mipha made it for him and him alone. You've always disliked Hylians even

298
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:48,659
before the Great Calamity. That is why Mipha never told you. Now that you know, you must promise to

299
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:54,649
help him save us all. Please, tell us where we can find the shock arrows we need. Knowing you,

300
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:59,300
I bet you have already figured it out. Never would have imagined she would make that special

301
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:13,859
armor for someone such as her. I do not approve of asking for help from a Hylian,

302
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:18,819
but I suppose it is our only option at this point. I am a proud Zora. That means I must take

303
01:14:18,819 --> 01:14:23,539
responsibility for my unwarranted behavior towards you. As promised, I shall tell you

304
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:32,729
where you can collect as many shock arrows as you will ever need. That tall mountain over yonder,

305
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:38,439
it's called Floymus Mountain, and there you will find Shatterback Point. A terrifying creature has

306
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:43,899
made its home up there. This awful beast shoots volley after volley of shock arrows. Even a single

307
01:14:43,899 --> 01:14:53,350
one could be fatal to a Zora. Aha! You must mean that...Lino. He is a man-beast, that one.

308
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:59,479
That beast does indeed wield shock arrows. Certainly one way to collect them. He's vicious,

309
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:04,760
to be sure, but I am certain Link will rise to the challenge. In order to reprove the divine beast,

310
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,960
I estimate that you will need at least 20 shock arrows. Do you think you can gather that many

311
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:15,689
shock arrows? Why do you still doubt him? I know Delta would be triumphant. Okay, Link, let's go.

312
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:21,060
Fastest way to Plyymus Mountain is to ascend the waterfall east of the domain,

313
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:26,460
and Zora armor should come in handy. Just swim up the waterfall, and then go up to the waterfall.

314
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:33,979
I'll wait at East Reservoir Lake, right by the divine beast. Gather at least 20 shock arrows,

315
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:40,199
then come join me. Okay, wonderful. Together we shall stop that divine beast's onslaught.

316
01:15:40,760 --> 01:16:02,819
Just made the most scrumptious cake. All right, let's do it. You guys remember like three years

317
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:12,739
ago when I would do the Neelix impression every two streams? I was on that for a long time. I did

318
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:16,579
it every two or three streams. I said it like five times a stream. I was obsessed with it.

319
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:29,260
Good morning. Welcome to Marot Mart. This is where you'll find our general store. Okay, cool.

320
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:52,739
Cool. Let's look at the store. Wait, this is not the store? This is the store. What do you got?

321
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:10,840
Violet? Salt? Oh, I think I need some salt. I'll take them all. 48 rupees. Excuse me? 48 rupees?

322
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:34,500
I don't have to pay for that, right? Hey, you're a Hylian, aren't you? It's rare to see your kind

323
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:43,880
around here. As for me, I was roaming nearby during my travels when Prince

324
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,840
Sidon recruited me and brought me here. That's because I can touch shock arrows,

325
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:55,319
but I also weigh you well a lot, so there's no way I'll be able to carry you on my back.

326
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:00,359
That's what Prince Sidon said to me. That's kind of rude of him, doesn't it?

327
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,579
Voice acting! How about this one? If I'm going to do some voice acting, why not? Let's do

328
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:16,220
how about this one? I told her the Hylian who stole Lady B for a way things. She can just come

329
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:21,210
wandering in here like nothing happened. What business do you have after all these years?

330
01:18:23,539 --> 01:18:31,140
Oh, it's the weapons workshop. Oh, cool. Okay. What are you doing? Well, I tried maintenance,

331
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:41,479
you know. Oh, nice. Okay. Well, good night. See you. What other voices can I do? Oh, how about

332
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:46,279
you? I got to do the voice acting. I don't know. Pardon me. Could you please get out of the way?

333
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:59,289
Oh, good morning. Who are you? I'm a Hylian. Oh, sorry. If you're a Hylian,

334
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:09,100
did you come from far away? I asked because. Oh, never mind. My dad told me not to talk to strangers.

335
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:21,800
I can do one thing. I can literally do one thing. Oh, it's you. Oh, wait. There's a quest here. Hold

336
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:39,270
on. Okay. You need materials. What kind? Luminous stone. I think I already have these, don't I?

337
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,310
If you have 10 of them, that would be a big help. I think I already have that.

338
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:57,050
Here are the stones. Thank you. All right. Is this like, should I not do this?

339
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:24,869
And a one and a two and a three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. What a bunch of

340
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:34,710
bullshit. Okay. All right. So I need to, this is where we go. Collect arrows. What's the fastest

341
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:46,020
way to get up here? I imagine from where I am, right? I want to cook some food though.

342
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:59,239
I'm not just going there. I need to cook some food. Where's the chef? What do you have to say?

343
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:08,340
What was it again? I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Go to the waterfall.

344
01:21:08,979 --> 01:21:21,689
I should get some more arrows. I'll buy some of these. These are useful. The fish too. Yeah.

345
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:46,180
Take the whole thing. XD. Oh my God. You're such a kidder. I know. I think I'm going to buy all the

346
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:54,329
regular arrows. How much is it for everything? Yeah. I'll take them all. Swim up the waterfall.

347
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:00,470
Yeah. I want to cook food first though. Make some cold elixir things or something.

348
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:57,300
How do you cook food here? In? Top left. Top right. Right. West. Hello. You are Link, right?

349
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:06,149
What do you ask? Prince Sidon ran off through the eastern gate. He was shouting something like,

350
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:10,760
I'm off to stop the divine beast. Link the Hylian is coming with me.

351
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:16,359
I assume that means you're going up Ploymus Mountain in search of shock arrows. Yes.

352
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:28,380
I have a request. What is it? There's a red maned monster called a Lionel that lives on Ploymus

353
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:36,069
Mountain. I really need a picture of a Lionel. Any of any red maned Lionel. Not just the one on

354
01:23:36,069 --> 01:23:48,500
the mountain. What do you say? Can you give me a picture? Sure. Okay. There's this fool in the

355
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:53,220
domain who goads people into jumping off Shatterback Point on Ploymus Mountain.

356
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,819
It's an incredibly dangerous jump and this guy pressures people into jumping off by questioning

357
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:01,300
their courage. He's a real bottom feeder. If this keeps up, someone is surely going to wind up

358
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:06,359
horribly injured. I need a picture of a Lionel to show everyone how scary they are. Maybe people

359
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:10,760
will stop going up there. Does that answer your question? I'll leave the details to you. Just

360
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:20,619
bring me a picture. I mean, I don't want to keep my own horn or anything, but how about I leave

361
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:25,979
the camera with you? I go on the top of the mountain and I'm going to dive off that mountain.

362
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:55,850
You get a picture of me halfway down. I'll do a flip. Go to the inn. What happened? No! Please climb

363
01:24:55,850 --> 01:25:30,539
it. Nobody saw that. How do I? I'm just teleporting back up here. What the fuck, dude? Title update?

364
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:53,659
Oh shit, the title is the same. I want to cook. Read the clothing. Swim up waterfalls. Okay. Yeah,

365
01:25:53,659 --> 01:26:07,210
I know. Yeah, I know. I just want to cook. So somebody said go to the inn. All right. Is there

366
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:18,649
a chef pot here? There's a chef pot right there. All right. Nice. Here we go. I got a lot of shit

367
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:31,939
to make. So long lasting flame for using your firewood. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Elixir

368
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:44,739
ingredient. I make elixirs. Okay. Cook dishes that will allow you to endure the cold. So let

369
01:26:44,739 --> 01:27:00,340
me hold this with these. Um, cook it with monster part. Oh, let me do that. Um, stop holding.

370
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:09,859
Monster parts. This is a monster part, right? So if I do, how many of these should I put in together?

371
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:16,470
So this is technically a monster part. So what is the, what's, what's the ratio I should do?

372
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:32,260
So, okay. How many bat wings, how many monster parts do I need to have? Why'd you just make me

373
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:40,710
press Y? Now I don't know where the fuck I just was. What the heck. Okay. So should I just do one

374
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:47,560
in one? What would happen if I did two bat wings and one lizard? What's the difference? What happens?

375
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:56,439
Always do 50-50. One-to-one is fine. There were two huge raids that just, that came in. Granny came

376
01:27:56,439 --> 01:28:04,489
in with a thousand people and then lots of monster parts. Okay. And then Ramola. That was, that's

377
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:14,710
how, those are monster raids. Welcome everybody. Ramola? Am I saying that right? What's up? Thanks

378
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:24,439
to the raids guys. Everybody. Welcome. Welcome guys. Raid song. There you go. No, we need to

379
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:28,380
kill that meme. No more of that. I don't want you guys doing that. I don't want you guys singing

380
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:35,770
that. We're killing that meme today. But no, thanks. Thanks for the raids. Hope you had a good stream,

381
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:42,619
whatever you're doing. We're playing Breath of the Wild and I'm trying to figure out how to cook food

382
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:48,020
because I don't get it. I mean, I do get it, but I don't. All right. I'm going to do two bat wings

383
01:28:48,020 --> 01:29:13,369
and two lizards. That makes sense to me. Okay. Two bat wings and two lizards. What does it do?

384
01:29:13,369 --> 01:29:21,159
420. Boost your movement speed while running. Wasn't it cold? Okay. Now let me cook some other

385
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:26,789
shit too. When cooked into a dish, temporarily increases your maximum hearts. All right. Let's

386
01:29:26,789 --> 01:29:55,500
put that in here. So I only do one effect. Some salt and that's it. All right. Nice. That's awesome.

387
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:15,399
Okay. I need to make some more. What's this? Electrical resistance. A fucking apple, two

388
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:36,699
mushrooms and a third mushroom. Four minutes of electricity resistance. Okay. Now what? Cook one

389
01:30:36,699 --> 01:30:56,600
radish and see what happens. Jesus. What? Why would you ever make another food? Would you ever

390
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:19,460
make another food for any reason? Radish it out. Yeah. Okay. What about meat? Double meat and I have

391
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:51,739
too much stealth bullshit. Meat, herbs. Oh, and electricity mushroom and banana. Two mushrooms.

392
01:31:51,739 --> 01:32:24,279
No, some salt. Whatever. Electro mushroom skewer. All right. This one's cold. Three of these. Okay.

393
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:30,359
Mushrooms. This is going to be cool. So things that increase cold resistance. This is a guava.

394
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:46,949
I need more cold resistance. Heat resistance. Oh, okay. This is going to be fished. This is going

395
01:32:46,949 --> 01:33:03,659
to be crazy. It's going to be like 40 minutes. 10 minutes. That's a big one. All right. Hold on.

396
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:34,739
Just truffles individually here too. Yeah. That's pretty good. Cook one pepper. Too many. Don't eat

397
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:42,069
these because it's not going to, you don't have that many hearts. Make an electro mushroom risotto.

398
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:57,270
What does milk do? Okay. Let's do, I didn't want to eat that. I wanted to pull. I don't know why I did

399
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:13,260
that. Eating raw wheat, whatever this is, rice. Okay. So then I need, what else do I got? Attack

400
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:34,439
power. Double banana. This is going to be gross. Ooh. Four minutes of attack power. Increases defense.

401
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:46,500
Oh, check this out. This is defense, right? What about a crab? This is going to be,

402
01:34:46,500 --> 01:35:23,510
this is a high level defense boost of four minutes. Two and a half minutes of low level. That's all

403
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:42,149
right. Movement speed. All right. What if I do three of these? A little dash of salt. Not very

404
01:35:42,149 --> 01:36:13,300
much. Not very much. Kind of running out of food to mix here. Purple mushroom. Oh my goodness. All

405
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:19,029
right. Yeah. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Back up. Stop holding. Let's do this again

406
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:38,810
because let's do two of these and three of these. Okay. Cook it with monster parts to draw out its

407
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:51,380
speed boost effect. I don't think that works. All right. Let's try this. Honey mushroom. All

408
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:58,310
right. This is five minutes of high level movement speed. It does it just in elixirs, not in food.

409
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:31,020
Okay. Okay. Rice, milk, salt, bitter cold. Why don't we just make, why don't we do all five? Wait,

410
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:41,420
what's the, isn't there a crab or something that has cold resistance? Stamina. Attack power.

411
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:48,949
Silently. Fish here. And salt. Let's go. I mean, I have so much food. It doesn't go bad, right?

412
01:37:48,949 --> 01:38:01,750
11 minutes of mid-level cold. All right. Uh, VR Josh has a good point. I should make stuff that

413
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:41,989
heals for like four or five so I don't just have a bunch of omega food. That's good. What about

414
01:38:41,989 --> 01:39:01,130
just cooking one fish? This is a waste. Kind of a waste. What about this? Five snails. Whatever

415
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:17,210
this is. 10 minutes of low level stealth boost. I'm, I can, let's make some elixirs. All right.

416
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:42,630
Frog. Uh, monster parts. Tail and horn. Let's try it. That was a good one, I guess.

417
01:39:42,630 --> 01:40:21,880
Oh, it says healing on it too. Okay. Stamina recovery elixir. That was a good one too,

418
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:48,939
apparently. All right. I think I'm good. Heat resistance. Attack power. Stamina. Stealth.

419
01:40:48,939 --> 01:41:17,819
Defense. Stealth. Okay. Defense. Defense. Stamina. That's good, right? What else was defense?

420
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:40,279
Something else was here, right? Salt. Salt. And the crab. The one that, it'll, uh, it'll negate

421
01:41:40,279 --> 01:42:00,420
the other thing, right? Make it extra salty? Okay. I'm gonna hold off the rest. I have a lot of food.

422
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:13,210
Look at all this food. That fits so much. Yeah, look at all this. How about a tree nut, two milks,

423
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:31,529
a rice, and a mushroom. Here's your mushroom risotto. I think I got enough food and I have,

424
01:42:31,529 --> 01:42:41,050
I have plenty of really good items. I'm kind of decked out right now. I got plenty of food.

425
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:58,539
So now go swim up the waterfall. How far away is this waterfall?

426
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:32,539
Where's this waterfall that it's talking about? Save the game. Good call. East. Is that it right

427
01:43:32,539 --> 01:44:06,729
there? Yeah, that's it right there. Oh, God damn it. Can we please get a Zoinks? Fine.

428
01:44:33,989 --> 01:44:40,039
Like, Zoinks, Scoob. I fucking banned that person. I actually banned that person for like an hour

429
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:44,899
because they just made me do that and I fucking hated it. I want that person banned for an hour.

430
01:44:44,899 --> 01:44:52,539
That's what I'm saying. That was like not good. It was like kind of annoying and it looked bad

431
01:44:52,539 --> 01:44:58,699
and like I did it wrong. I want that person timed over an hour. I genuinely want that person banned.

432
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:16,010
It was good. No time that okay, maybe not an hour, but at least five minutes.

433
01:45:16,010 --> 01:46:00,170
Hold on. So I need to get up there and walk across this bridge. One thing you can say about

434
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:08,470
Germa is he moisturizes. You get over 35 and you tell me if it's time to start moisturizing.

435
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:41,189
But I had this equipped. Actually, I need those arrows. That's good. I started moisturizing

436
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:47,930
because of you. You know, there is one thing that I will say. If there's a few things that

437
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:55,960
people will take from this stream, don't forget about anything else, right? Drink more water.

438
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,119
Don't drink too much water though. It's like you don't have to be sitting there chugging it.

439
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:06,840
Moisturize when you get out of the shower. Just a light moisturizer for your face. Just put it on.

440
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:12,979
It takes two seconds. It takes two seconds. When you get out of the shower, dry your face,

441
01:47:12,979 --> 01:47:18,039
get a nice face moisturizer. It takes just a little bit and just smear it on. That's it.

442
01:47:18,039 --> 01:48:00,539
You're done. Okay, so I can swim up this. Whoa, that's interesting. Cool. Damn, 37. How do you

443
01:48:00,539 --> 01:48:07,020
deal with getting older? Honestly, you just do. You just, everyone gets older. That's it.

444
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,899
There is no, oh, I have to like, you know, you just, everyone's going to get older.

445
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:21,220
Eventually you get old, but as long as you just keep a good mindset,

446
01:48:21,859 --> 01:48:26,420
moisturize, drink some water, eat, eat okay. I don't eat the best, right?

447
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:36,939
I know that food pyramid thing I did the other, like a year ago was a meme, but you know,

448
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:46,550
you know, just take care of yourself. Take care of yourself enough because honestly,

449
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:52,069
like taking care of yourself so much to the point where it almost becomes like a job on its own too.

450
01:48:53,619 --> 01:48:58,100
Right? Like paying attention to how healthy you are, what you're eating. No, I can't eat that.

451
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:05,140
I don't want to eat that. It's bad for me. It can be kind of hard, but just take care of yourself

452
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:13,369
as, as well as you can. But enjoy life too. Enjoy shit. You want to eat a triple cheeseburger one

453
01:49:13,369 --> 01:49:27,979
day? Do it. Don't do it every day. Just do it whenever you feel like it. Turning 30 in a week,

454
01:49:27,979 --> 01:49:33,020
you have any wise words? No, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Just once you get over 30,

455
01:49:33,659 --> 01:49:39,159
you're going to, you kind of, you, I don't know, you kind of unplug from the matrix and you're just

456
01:49:39,159 --> 01:49:44,619
like, Oh, whatever. Wait, that's a bad reference. That means that that's okay. Hold on. Let me redo

457
01:49:44,619 --> 01:50:19,420
that. Who is this? That's good, right? They're going to find this on my dead body. Oh my goodness.

458
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:27,300
You almost killed me in one fucking hit defense. I'm going to do defense. Where's my defense food?

459
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,579
Health. This is, which one is he's a defense? This one here, right?

460
01:50:34,390 --> 01:51:00,460
All right. Two and a half minutes of mid-level defense boost. Let's go. I got it. It can't do

461
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:18,939
anything. I feel like that didn't even negate any damage. I got the picture, right? That one is

462
01:51:18,939 --> 01:51:50,649
actually better. Can I at least get one hit? Let me try to get one swing on this guy. Don't fight.

463
01:51:50,649 --> 01:52:14,100
Why not? So is it a horizontal or vertical swing? Okay. Okay. I can fight this. I can kill this for

464
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:26,039
sure. This is a dodge better. I have to dodge better. It's two horizontal swings. That's it.

465
01:52:26,039 --> 01:53:49,380
He's standing in water. Are you kidding me? Shut up. What was that? What are you doing?

466
01:53:50,420 --> 01:54:11,350
I'm going to break every weapon on this guy. This is actually bad, isn't it? These are all my cool

467
01:54:11,350 --> 01:55:15,159
weapons. What if every single one of them breaks? Whatever. Let's go. No, thanks. I'm all right. I'm

468
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:34,760
okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I don't want to eat the high-level one. I think I just want to heal.

469
01:55:34,760 --> 01:56:21,109
Just heal. That's it. Everything is so good. I'm going to eat this. Let's go. Got him. It's

470
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:32,470
larger and heavier than a horse's hoof. It's useful for making elixirs. Wait. Look what I did,

471
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:43,380
right? I have to prove that I did this. Otherwise, I don't think that she'll believe me. Wait. Yeah.

472
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:55,239
I don't know. It's going to be a selfie. Otherwise, how can I prove? Wait. Well,

473
01:56:55,239 --> 01:57:10,359
you didn't even kill it. Yes, I did. Lionel's sword. 24. Oh, man. I'm going to hide. Oh, shit.

474
01:57:10,359 --> 01:57:23,159
What is 10 times three? Three arrows? This thing's almost broken. Just get rid of it.

475
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:45,640
I can't throw this away. Whatever. Oh, it's a bow. I'm an idiot. And then Lionel's shield.

476
01:57:46,279 --> 01:58:03,239
I can really only... Okay. Wait a minute. Which one of these is better? Am I just wasting the

477
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:08,979
get rid of one of the guardian shields? That feels terrible. It's only the number that matters. Okay.

478
01:58:09,909 --> 01:58:15,100
Just jest the number that it's only the ma... It's only the number that matters.

479
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:20,619
Oh, look at how cool this is though. All right. I'll get rid of it.

480
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:46,949
What is it? Keep the phrenic bow. What should I get rid of instead? The Lysal bow? Soldier's bow?

481
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:54,890
Phrenic is good. Phrenic is good for long range. Okay. Should I get rid of the

482
01:58:55,770 --> 01:59:08,920
soldier's bow? Soldier's bow sucks. Okay. Well, that was cool. I killed it and I got the

483
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:18,500
sword and shit. Let's see what it looks like. 24. Very cool. All right. Let's go.

484
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:49,510
Here are the shock arrows. I need 20 of these. Shock arrow. Oh, what am I doing? Okay. Take a

485
01:59:49,510 --> 02:00:53,800
picture of it and then set the beep beep for it. That's what I should be doing. Go. Okay. I didn't

486
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:59,829
do this at all in my playthrough. I am going to tell you I probably won't do it that much in mine

487
02:00:59,829 --> 02:01:46,199
either because I will forget it exists. Okay. How many do I have now? Oh shit. There's a million

488
02:01:46,199 --> 02:02:10,060
up here. What's this? Oh, this is the jump point. Wait, that's the guardian right there.

489
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:44,979
That's the guardian right there. I'm not ready. I need 20. I have 18. I need 20, right? Where are

490
02:02:44,979 --> 02:03:06,649
they? Oh, they're up. They're not just in the base of the trees. All right. There's 20 right here.

491
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:23,720
All right. I have 20 arrows. It wasn't 25, right? Save, save, save, save, save, save, save. 20,

492
02:03:23,720 --> 02:04:13,159
but the more the better. Well, I might as well be prepared, right? Take it, man. Take it.

493
02:04:14,199 --> 02:05:12,199
Take it. I think I got them all. I believe that. Oh, no. Is it once in this tree higher? Oh, sorry.

494
02:05:12,199 --> 02:05:18,579
All right. I think that's good. I'm ready. I'm going to go fight the first divine beast of the

495
02:05:18,579 --> 02:06:37,859
game. The divine, um, elephant, I think. Let's go jump at your own risk. Um, what was that? What's

496
02:06:37,859 --> 02:08:16,069
your problem into the, um, steam or something? I'm not losing those two hearts. Not happening.

497
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:28,170
Okay. Well, the quest marker is over here. So I'm imagining maybe I have to go to like the dock or

498
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:57,770
something. Is there a dock over here? Oh, okay. Sidon is right here. There we go. All right. So I

499
02:08:57,770 --> 02:09:08,039
have my shock arrows equipped. I have, I want my strong bow and Knight's bow equipped. I'm ready

500
02:09:08,039 --> 02:09:22,579
to do this. Let's go. Glad to see you ready to go, Link. Are you ready for this? Do you have your

501
02:09:22,579 --> 02:09:31,130
Zora armor and enough shock arrows? Let us go and appease that divine beast. Here we go.

502
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:57,619
Gaze now upon the divine beast's back. Shoot the glowing pink orbs with a shock arrow. Okay.

503
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,159
I shall take you right up to the side of the divine beast. And from there, you can swim and

504
02:10:03,159 --> 02:10:13,449
take aim. I know you can do it. I believe in you. Hurry up and get on my back. Good answer. Here we

505
02:10:13,449 --> 02:10:33,619
go. Full speed. It's up to you. Ward off the attacks. Are you ready? Divine beast Varuna will

506
02:10:33,619 --> 02:10:39,079
undoubtedly use its ancient laser and that includes hurling giant ice blocks.

507
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:52,600
Let's go. He talks. How am I going to watch that ice? How do I, how do I stop the ice?

508
02:11:00,859 --> 02:11:32,760
Sidon, I haven't blocked one. Hey, how do I stop the ice? Okay. I made him hit his head.

509
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:41,939
Oh, fuck. I think I'm missing something here. Oh, I can shatter it. I can shatter them.

510
02:11:47,189 --> 02:12:20,579
Shatter it. Oh my God. I'm restarting. Yeah. Get up there. Oh, help. Help. Help.

511
02:12:29,220 --> 02:13:01,319
You let me drown, dude. What the hell? Okay. All right. That's it. Sidon, where are you?

512
02:13:09,979 --> 02:13:13,750
Stop swimming around and stop doing this.

513
02:13:19,539 --> 02:14:21,319
Bro, there ain't nothing here. Oh, I got it. Get this fucking blue shell out of here.

514
02:14:21,399 --> 02:15:01,539
Ready. Got them all. Now it's time. What an absolute thrill. Oh, that was the rain. Okay.

515
02:15:01,539 --> 02:15:12,600
That's cool. Floating higher. You wanted to venture inside of it, right? I'll bring you close.

516
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:27,020
Counting on you. Do good work in there. I have to go inside. This is not just a boss.

517
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:34,069
Here we are. Looks like this is where the real work starts.

518
02:15:35,029 --> 02:15:39,939
Best of luck. Nice job cutting off the water flow from this divine beast.

519
02:15:40,659 --> 02:16:02,039
Show the enemy no fear. I'll see you back at Zora's domain. Farewell. This thing's pissed.

520
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:34,069
Do I have my five bologna sandwiches? Three grenades and a dagger. Oh, and I got an iPod.

521
02:16:34,069 --> 02:16:41,110
Just give me an iPod with like the entire Bill Burr podcast on it.

522
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:43,780
Arrow's every episode. I'll be good.

523
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:58,659
All right. So this is just a big shrine. Okay. If you hit the eye, the eye closes.

524
02:18:10,659 --> 02:18:37,579
Interesting. Cool. Okay. Okay. So an eye right here. Shock arrow.

525
02:18:39,850 --> 02:19:04,059
I can't electrify the water. I'm standing in, right? This is the first real dungeon. Good luck.

526
02:19:05,799 --> 02:19:28,809
So would you say that these dungeons are more traditional Zelda? Divine beast controls have

527
02:19:28,809 --> 02:19:37,620
been enabled. Yes. Okay. No. A lot more yeses than nos. Good. You've obtained the map of the

528
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:43,579
divine beast. You will see several glowing points on your map, which represent the terminals that

529
02:19:43,579 --> 02:19:57,299
control Ruta. Take Ruta back by activating all of the terminals. Be careful. Okay. Whoa.

530
02:20:01,639 --> 02:20:11,639
That's very interesting. Okay. So where am I? All right. There's a thing down here. I can manipulate

531
02:20:11,639 --> 02:21:05,190
move trunk. Wait, wait, what? Okay. What's in here? Okay. Use my Sheikah tablet. Remember,

532
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:14,680
this is the first playthrough. Yeah, it is. Okay. So this is where the main control unit is. So I

533
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:21,459
gotta remember that where his butt is, right? This is where the main control valve is. Please

534
02:21:21,459 --> 02:21:28,659
remember that because I won't. All right. So I am here. I'm going to bang a right.

535
02:21:28,659 --> 02:21:47,270
I need to go this way. Oh, wait, what's this? Oh, this can, this, this can be manipulated. Oh,

536
02:21:47,270 --> 02:22:18,569
this can be manipulated. It's going to fall, isn't it? Thank you. You fucking idiot. Okay.

537
02:22:23,579 --> 02:23:03,860
This one. So now I gotta go. It's like I gotta go up a level this way. So they were preparing

538
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:20,389
me for this fight. Oh, these things probably drop like crazy now. Right. All right. Cool.

539
02:23:20,950 --> 02:23:32,059
I love the way these look. I'm buying one of these off Etsy. You bet your ass I am. Okay.

540
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:52,700
So now I got this thing here. Well, the room, they're going to make this thing turn. What

541
02:23:52,700 --> 02:24:17,290
if I stopped this? Can I? It's on Etsy right now. It's on it. Nobody buy that. There's only one of

542
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:48,379
them left. Don't buy that one. That thing looks awesome. Only one left. No one buy that. What

543
02:24:48,379 --> 02:24:55,370
about out here? Maybe I can't do anything with it yet. Do I have to get inside? Oh, I know what to

544
02:24:55,370 --> 02:25:18,309
do. Now you're thinking of a gas. I don't know why I went like this. Now you're working with gas.

545
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:56,500
Why did I like tilt my head this way? Hmm. How do I move this though? Well, I'm going to get this

546
02:26:02,139 --> 02:26:17,940
hundred rupees. All right. I'll take it. I try to stop the flow of water. What can I even manipulate

547
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:32,620
here? I can manipulate this shit. Wait a minute. Can I just get in here? I don't think I can just

548
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:54,920
get in there. Shit. I know I said, give me three grenades. What would I do? What would I use them

549
02:26:54,920 --> 02:27:00,379
for? I would go through all five sandwiches and just be starving in here and be like, I should

550
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:06,899
have asked for more sandwiches. Why don't I bring the grenades? I would be desperately asking for

551
02:27:06,899 --> 02:27:12,889
one or two more sandwiches. What was the point of the grenades? I don't even know why. I don't

552
02:27:12,889 --> 02:27:44,680
even need to dagger. Okay. I think I can do this. All right. So now, um, is this stupid what I'm

553
02:27:44,680 --> 02:29:23,459
doing? Oh, look at that. Where am I? Put that down. I need to stop this from moving. Can I? Oh,

554
02:29:23,459 --> 02:29:37,479
look at that. All right. Cool. I didn't know you could do that. Uh, okay. That's the way it goes

555
02:29:37,479 --> 02:29:56,579
all the way. I have to stop it when it gets to be right here. Like right now. Is that good enough?

556
02:29:56,579 --> 02:30:28,260
Is it draining the water? It is. Okay. Well, I didn't think it was going to drain the water.

557
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:32,090
It's draining the water. I didn't. Okay. I didn't think it was going to drain the water.

558
02:30:36,809 --> 02:30:55,899
We had a frame drop. Whoa, we did. Holy shit. Why? That was weird. But that was a bad one. There we

559
02:30:55,899 --> 02:31:20,549
go. I'm going to try. Okay. Now that being said, what do I do with this? I mean, what is this shit

560
02:31:20,549 --> 02:31:49,209
all over there? This is, um, junk right here. What are you trying to communicate? Octopus arm? What

561
02:31:49,209 --> 02:32:14,739
are you communicating here? Maybe I should just keep going. What are you communicating? An octopus

562
02:32:14,739 --> 02:32:58,469
arm. Octopus arm slug. L omega lull octopus arm face. Octopus arm fish. Wait a minute.

563
02:32:58,469 --> 02:33:12,520
Is that what you mean when you go in like this? That's not what you meant? Oh, it is? But how come

564
02:33:12,520 --> 02:34:54,260
it didn't work? Oh shit. I did it. I didn't do it. Okay. I get it now though. I understand.

565
02:35:47,700 --> 02:36:50,020
Ancient. Oh, ancient core. I'm all right. Shit's upside down.

566
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:53,930
Can I make it go faster? How do I make it go the other way? Can I, can it turn the other way?

567
02:37:53,930 --> 02:38:58,920
Go the other way. How do I make it go the other way? Why is everybody going like this? All right.

568
02:38:58,920 --> 02:40:05,819
This is open. I'll be able to see it. Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. I'm not ready. I want to just

569
02:40:05,819 --> 02:40:24,920
shoot water down this way. Hold on. Um, wait, shoot. How do I make it go further? Can I make,

570
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:49,860
can I, how do I do this? I think maybe I can block it with the ice. What is this? What does

571
02:40:49,860 --> 02:41:50,389
that mean? What's this? Oh, I get it. I get it. Nice. Okay. Now I see what that is. That was pretty

572
02:41:50,389 --> 02:42:52,020
cool. How do I get up? I guess now I can ride it that way. Ooh. Twinkie. We're good. Right. Okay.

573
02:42:57,979 --> 02:43:13,370
Another shortcut shortcut back down. Cool. Very nice. Well, I got to check over here.

574
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:45,940
Um, well, okay. Is that a secret or anything? Chest or something? I could have thought there

575
02:43:45,940 --> 02:44:27,739
would be a chest or something. Oh well. I got the shortcut. I'm fine. Here we go. Nice halberd.

576
02:44:27,739 --> 02:45:04,389
Very good. I'll equip that right now. No, let's use the regular guardian spear. All right. All

577
02:45:04,389 --> 02:45:20,389
right. So that's gone. What does that really do for me though? I think I need to keep it moving.

578
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:51,579
Can I just climb this? Never be that easy with it. Maybe. Hold on. Somebody made a gift of you

579
02:45:51,579 --> 02:46:07,930
farting out the front door. No, it's not. All right. This is just, I can see this in my peripheral.

580
02:46:07,930 --> 02:46:42,100
I just got to go. Can I swim up that first try? No, you can't see the fire. Okay. This fire. I

581
02:46:42,100 --> 02:47:06,940
got to probably put the fire out, but how do I do that? Hold on. What if I go put it all the way

582
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:48,250
down? Because now can I stand on that? Excuse me. What the fuck are you doing here? Okay. 10 fire

583
02:47:48,250 --> 02:48:58,899
arrows. Nice. Shit. No, wrong way. What the fuck is this? Wait, where am I? Oh, okay. It was right

584
02:48:58,899 --> 02:52:05,299
underneath. Okay. I screwed up. Whoa. Okay. Very cool. Ancient shaft. I think I got it. Where is

585
02:52:05,299 --> 02:54:57,690
this fucking thing? Whoa. What is that? All right. Where, where's, how do I get up here?

586
02:55:23,059 --> 02:56:34,379
But how do I? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what yeah means. Can I make it from here?

587
02:56:34,379 --> 02:56:56,040
I made it. I made it. I'm on top. I'm on top. All right. Now what? Now what?

588
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:33,340
Fine. Let's go. I got it. There it is. Oh yeah. Hey, remember the person that said C in five hours?

589
02:57:33,340 --> 02:57:54,899
It was actually one hour. Sorry. So this last one is in his head. The real question is,

590
02:57:55,620 --> 02:58:11,860
how do I get in there? It's right in the center of his head. Do I just drop straight down? I'm

591
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:16,069
kind of afraid to go anywhere. Straight down right there. I think that's what I need to do.

592
02:58:16,629 --> 02:58:49,100
And I think that's it. This is definitely it. This is it. All right. Got it. Okay. I just spin

593
02:58:49,100 --> 02:59:21,559
this. All right. I mean, that's pretty self-explanatory. Missed it, but that's

594
02:59:21,559 --> 03:00:17,100
all right. The water. I did it. Let them out. They can be free. That was really cool. That really

595
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:56,680
was just sort of a super shrine. I should probably heal. The music does not sound like I just won

596
03:00:56,680 --> 03:01:09,979
maybe defense food or something. I think I'm going to do defense food. Sounds good. High level

597
03:01:09,979 --> 03:01:18,219
defense food or low level defense food. Well, let's just see what it is first. I'm going to

598
03:01:18,219 --> 03:01:43,639
heal with just regular ass food. This is plus five hearts. I'm doing this. All right. Whatever

599
03:01:43,639 --> 03:01:50,569
this is, it's time to fight it. So I'm going to use my guardian sword and I'm going to use this

600
03:01:50,569 --> 03:01:55,909
cool shield. Let's get rid of one of these. All right. Let's do it. Let's go. All right.

601
03:01:55,909 --> 03:02:44,790
Fuck you. Whatever you are. Fuck you. You fucking bloomin' onion. Let's go. Oh, God. Water Blight

602
03:02:44,790 --> 03:03:12,420
Ganon. I thought that was Water Blight Ganon talking. All right. Leave me a voicemail because

603
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:46,219
I'm going to be busy here in a sec. Electricity. Electricity. I didn't jump over it. Oh, shit.

604
03:03:46,219 --> 03:04:53,459
Where'd he go? Whoa. Oh, my God. Can you even dodge that? Why are you taking a picture of me?

605
03:04:53,459 --> 03:05:02,020
What? Oh, take a picture. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a terrible photo of that. I mean,

606
03:05:02,020 --> 03:05:25,420
that's kind of cool though. Try to keep the water. No. Yes. That's still counted, right?

607
03:05:25,420 --> 03:05:46,139
In a mod chat. Help me here. I think I got a picture of it. I think I'm fine.

608
03:05:50,170 --> 03:06:05,530
I got a photo. I got a photo already. Get up. He's supposed to torch the water.

609
03:06:11,639 --> 03:06:44,569
Link, stop being such a slug. Get up. I already took a picture. Wait. They're doing it because

610
03:06:44,569 --> 03:07:18,409
the frame lag. What? Stop talking. Fucking backseat Andy over here. My bow is broken.

611
03:07:18,969 --> 03:08:00,809
Oh, no. Give me a bow. Take this calamity again. Yeah, I am dropping frames. You're right.

612
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:07,139
I thought you were saying take a picture. I thought I got the photo wrong.

613
03:08:12,709 --> 03:08:20,700
Pretty good cleric beast. I thought it was like, hey, dude, what the fuck? You take a picture.

614
03:08:20,700 --> 03:08:32,010
Take a picture. Just dropping a shitload of frames. They were doing. Yeah, I see. Okay.

615
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:45,700
What a bad time for frames to drop. It was horrible. Well, I beat the boss.

616
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:55,129
Hold on. PowerPoint. Let me just see what this looks like. What was the viewer experience?

617
03:09:03,719 --> 03:09:19,819
Oh my god. Can you even dodge that? Okay. Well, that's unfortunate, but whatever.

618
03:09:26,280 --> 03:09:48,889
Very cool. All right. So now what? I'll take my heart container. That was really fun. Wait,

619
03:09:48,889 --> 03:09:59,209
once you activate, you cannot go back in. So I didn't miss anything important, right? I think

620
03:09:59,209 --> 03:10:10,389
I got pretty much everything important, I think, right? You're good. All right, let's go. So that's

621
03:10:10,389 --> 03:10:23,290
one of four. This is probably the easier of the four bosses. It doesn't have to be, you know,

622
03:10:23,290 --> 03:10:33,000
it doesn't have to be incredibly difficult to be fun. I think it was fun. It was perfect.

623
03:10:40,629 --> 03:10:43,700
Just in case you didn't know who that was.

624
03:10:44,180 --> 03:10:53,659
Since I am now a spirit, my healing power would be wasted on me.

625
03:10:53,659 --> 03:11:06,059
So therefore, I would like you to have it. Please accept Mipha's grace.

626
03:11:10,500 --> 03:11:26,780
What does that do? Yesterday, I was awash in a pool of tears. I had nearly given up hope

627
03:11:26,780 --> 03:11:35,000
and resigned myself to being trapped here as a spirit for the rest of eternity. But now you're

628
03:11:35,079 --> 03:11:43,530
here. All this time, my hope was to see you once more. Promise me that you will not hesitate to

629
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:51,030
call upon my power if you ever find yourself in need. A summon? Knowing that will let my spirit

630
03:11:51,030 --> 03:12:03,270
rest in peace. I must go. Ruta and I have our roles to fulfill. We are both honored to be able

631
03:12:03,270 --> 03:12:11,299
to play the role of support. We'll annihilate Ganon together. Farewell. See ya.

632
03:12:22,760 --> 03:12:26,440
Oh, that's cool. It's an instant revive on cooldown. That's really cool.

633
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:45,430
I feel like I could probably use that. So this thing is now back under our control.

634
03:12:46,309 --> 03:13:49,770
Friendly elephant. Oh, you think Calamity Ganon is looking out the window right now?

635
03:13:50,409 --> 03:13:53,270
Oh, no, fuck.

636
03:14:33,020 --> 03:14:34,940
Ganon's gonna be in the tower and just be looking out.

637
03:14:35,340 --> 03:14:38,280
Then we can restore peace to Hyrule.

638
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:42,520
You'll never get another three. You need four. You'll never get three more.

639
03:14:59,540 --> 03:15:00,739
That's a cool looking tower.

640
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:26,459
Dude, you need to shut up. This is an emotional scene. You don't care at all.

641
03:15:28,219 --> 03:15:38,500
What are you talking about? Yeah, I do. Cool. Oh, that's so awesome.

642
03:15:38,500 --> 03:19:52,379
I was hard to hold that because he's doing the doggy paddle.

643
03:19:55,030 --> 03:20:12,469
What is this? All right, hold on. Okay, that's it.

644
03:20:12,469 --> 03:20:17,750
And that's also going to be the end of the stream.

645
03:20:17,750 --> 03:20:25,049
I think that's a good place to stop right after that.

646
03:20:28,309 --> 03:20:47,399
No, what do you mean? Oh, I'm sorry. No, you can't. No. Finish. At least,

647
03:20:47,399 --> 03:20:51,780
okay, I'll at least finish the quest. That makes sense.

648
03:20:51,780 --> 03:20:58,790
Honestly, the reason why I had to stop doing that stupid routine

649
03:20:58,790 --> 03:21:00,969
is I actually had no fucking idea where I was going.

650
03:21:01,290 --> 03:21:04,090
Like, okay, I can't see on the map and I'm not going to go back to the...

651
03:21:04,729 --> 03:21:11,639
How would you even know where you were going?

652
03:21:11,639 --> 03:21:17,829
All right, I'll finish this quest and then I'm going to call it.

653
03:21:17,829 --> 03:21:21,190
And then I'll be live again. What's today? Sunday?

654
03:21:21,829 --> 03:21:26,170
How's Wednesday look? I think Wednesday is good.

655
03:21:33,319 --> 03:21:35,000
Same time around three o'clock Pacific.

656
03:21:43,159 --> 03:21:48,040
All right, get back up here. Finish the quest. Get my shit in here.

657
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:49,879
All right, before I'm going to get it. It's another cut scene.

658
03:21:49,879 --> 03:21:54,120
Whatever. It's cool. 3 p.m. Pacific. Yep. On Wednesday.

659
03:21:57,319 --> 03:21:58,440
Thanks for watching, though. Appreciate it.

660
03:22:07,459 --> 03:22:10,520
Same game. Now, that is a good question.

661
03:22:12,020 --> 03:22:17,770
I'm going to ask everybody here. Do you want...

662
03:22:18,409 --> 03:22:24,379
Let's get a poll. Do you want more Breath of the Wild on Wednesday?

663
03:22:25,020 --> 03:22:32,889
I'm going to need a very large amount of people saying yes.

664
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:43,899
Saved Zora's Domain.

665
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:53,500
Link sincerely apologized for my harsh treatment of you.

666
03:22:54,299 --> 03:22:57,899
You were thinking Hyrule's and Lady Mipha's well-being just like the rest of us.

667
03:23:01,959 --> 03:23:03,639
Something else. All right, you know what?

668
03:23:03,639 --> 03:23:06,680
I mean, this is a 90% again, which is shocking.

669
03:23:07,319 --> 03:23:13,989
It seems like you don't like the game. What?

670
03:23:16,459 --> 03:23:18,540
I'm telling you right now, the amount...

671
03:23:18,540 --> 03:23:21,420
Okay, the percentage that is voting yes right now

672
03:23:21,420 --> 03:23:23,819
is at least what I feel about this game for a score.

673
03:23:26,950 --> 03:23:29,110
At the very least. I think this is great.

674
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:31,399
I'm having a great time.

675
03:23:35,989 --> 03:23:38,149
I just want to make sure you guys are having a good time still.

676
03:23:39,770 --> 03:23:44,250
I'm usually three stream Andy with a game besides Elden Ring.

677
03:23:48,139 --> 03:23:49,899
If you're still liking it, I'm still liking it.

678
03:23:49,899 --> 03:23:50,940
Let's keep doing it.

679
03:23:50,940 --> 03:23:53,180
Maybe I'll play some Splatoon on Wednesday.

680
03:23:54,500 --> 03:23:55,379
That sounds good, right?

681
03:24:00,790 --> 03:24:02,069
Maybe open up with some Splatoon.

682
03:24:02,069 --> 03:24:03,750
Mess around for like an hour or two.

683
03:24:03,750 --> 03:24:05,260
Jump back into Breath of the Wild.

684
03:24:09,579 --> 03:24:10,700
Yeah, we'll do that.

685
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:17,260
The switch is hooked up.

686
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:18,219
It's ready.

687
03:24:18,219 --> 03:24:19,100
It's being captured.

688
03:24:21,510 --> 03:24:23,909
Okay, so there's a cool chest over here.

689
03:24:25,379 --> 03:24:28,020
By the way, Link, I see you are without your trusty blade.

690
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:29,700
The sword that seals the darkness.

691
03:24:30,780 --> 03:24:32,780
Did you perhaps lose it when you lost your memory?

692
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:34,670
Maybe.

693
03:24:38,780 --> 03:24:40,700
Yeah, so we'll do Splatoon 3.

694
03:24:41,420 --> 03:24:43,500
And Breath of the Wild again on Wednesday.

695
03:24:43,500 --> 03:24:51,149
Okay.

696
03:24:51,530 --> 03:25:02,090
As your father, I am proud of you for fighting the Divine Beast alongside Link.

697
03:25:02,090 --> 03:25:04,680
You've grown much recently.

698
03:25:05,239 --> 03:25:07,559
I know you'll be a worthy heir when your time comes.

699
03:25:08,200 --> 03:25:10,250
Mother, thank you.

700
03:25:10,889 --> 03:25:14,389
The heavy rains have stopped and the Divine Beast is our ally once again.

701
03:25:16,489 --> 03:25:17,450
Truly splendid.

702
03:25:18,409 --> 03:25:19,129
This is wonderful.

703
03:25:19,129 --> 03:25:19,629
Cool.

704
03:25:20,090 --> 03:25:21,139
All right, what's on the chest?

705
03:25:32,120 --> 03:25:34,440
Top tier expression of gratitude.

706
03:25:34,440 --> 03:25:40,360
All right, we're gonna have a party?

707
03:25:52,459 --> 03:25:56,709
All right, so what is in the chest?

708
03:25:57,430 --> 03:26:04,549
Light scale trident.

709
03:26:12,260 --> 03:26:12,899
Cool.

710
03:26:12,899 --> 03:26:16,010
Does this do anything cool?

711
03:26:18,629 --> 03:26:19,670
This can be repaired.

712
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:21,350
It's a unique weapon and can repair.

713
03:26:24,540 --> 03:26:25,420
Save this weapon.

714
03:26:25,420 --> 03:26:26,620
Do not use it.

715
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:27,180
Okay.

716
03:26:27,180 --> 03:26:30,700
I mean, I wasn't planning on it.

717
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:35,299
All these ones like this 60, this plus plus plus plus.

718
03:26:35,299 --> 03:26:36,739
I'm gonna hoard so many of these items.

719
03:26:39,110 --> 03:26:39,989
I'll use the default.

720
03:26:42,260 --> 03:26:43,139
Okay, cool.

721
03:26:43,139 --> 03:26:43,940
All right, guys.

722
03:26:43,940 --> 03:26:45,219
I'll see you on Wednesday.

723
03:26:45,219 --> 03:26:51,700
Thanks for watching.

724
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:52,659
Have a good rest of your night.

725
03:26:54,549 --> 03:26:55,670
I'm gonna save it right here.

726
03:26:55,909 --> 03:27:09,000
This is exactly where we're gonna open back up.

727
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:10,360
What about the photo?

728
03:27:10,360 --> 03:27:11,959
We'll do that right when I get up.

729
03:27:11,959 --> 03:27:14,200
When I start again on Wednesday.

730
03:27:14,200 --> 03:27:30,069
It looks like all the last part of the Stream of Conscious Charity is going on still.

731
03:27:30,069 --> 03:27:32,309
Yeah, I'll send you guys there.

732
03:27:32,309 --> 03:27:33,510
Sent you there last night, too.

733
03:27:33,510 --> 03:27:36,569
I think it's Vinny's doing something right.

734
03:27:36,569 --> 03:27:40,840
Go say hello.

735
03:27:40,840 --> 03:27:45,290
Go support the charity stream, obviously.

736
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:47,450
And I'll talk to you guys later.

737
03:27:47,450 --> 03:27:48,090
See you Wednesday.

738
03:27:48,090 --> 03:27:48,809
Take care of yourselves.

739
03:27:48,809 --> 03:27:49,290
Good night.

740
03:27:49,290 --> 03:27:49,930
Goodbye.

741
03:27:49,930 --> 03:27:51,780
Say what?

742
03:27:51,780 --> 03:28:10,659
I almost forgot.

743
03:28:10,659 --> 03:28:11,459
Yeah, call your mother.

744
03:28:11,459 --> 03:28:11,959
Come on.
