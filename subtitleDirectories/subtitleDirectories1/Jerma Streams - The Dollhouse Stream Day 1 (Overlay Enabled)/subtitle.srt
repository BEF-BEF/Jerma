1
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:34,169
I want anybody to see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.

2
00:12:00,250 --> 00:13:16,759
See my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up

3
00:20:07,240 --> 00:21:33,579
Can't breathe without these

4
00:24:31,180 --> 00:25:56,940
Can't breathe without these

5
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,690
Just a little too big

6
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:10,069
Oh a mailbox

7
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:21,720

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:31,660
Whose house is this? This is my house. Let me give it a check. Stay in there. Hello. Can you hear me?

9
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,890
Why don't we give it one more check?

10
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,980
I'm here

11
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:55,109
That was a voice crack in the first 10 seconds. It's not bad. It's not bad at all

12
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,670
I mean, I kind of feel like a dickhead just by the way that I'm dressed, but you know, whatever

sink

18
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:28,119
I can't believe it. How many rooms do I have just one or do I have two? How many do I have?

19
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,140
Oh, it's a nice bathroom

20
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,660
spacious

21
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,420
Comfortable I can utilize this

22
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,069
toilet

23
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:49,369
Shower and sink. Does this sink work too? What do you think? Should we try it? It does

24
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,009
A workable sink

25
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,660
I feel pretty good

26
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,059
But that that could change really really quickly. I'll look into this one here. Um, take care of me

27
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:03,140
Don't fuck around

28
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
You've got three streams to do this

29
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm just gonna go i'm gonna go in the kitchen. Whatever

30
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:21,779
Why not? Is there anything even in the fridge? I don't even know what's even in here

31
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:32,890

00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:52,380
There are cars on this road. There are cars on the street. All right, when can I stop doing this?

I'm starting to stink. All right, i'm going back in i'm going back in

Let me wash my hands. That was a fucking big run

72
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:52,900
All right

73
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,860
We can just chill. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to go anywhere

74
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,960
Oh, this is awful

75
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:12,949
Can I go? No, why can't I not?

76
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,260
That one I can't I don't know what that one doesn't do anything. Why?

77
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,119
Do

78
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,809
Why am I going outside?

79
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:48,380
Why am I going outside? What are you doing? Hey, I don't

80
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,900
Wait a fucking second. All right, i'm not going out there yet

81
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,250
I don't want to go out. This is a beautiful day out here

82
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,440
Look at those birds

83
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,969
This is pretty nice. I like this

84
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:17,139
Look at these flowers

85
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,780
They're beautiful. I smell so bad

86
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,659
Take care of me for god's sake

87
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,630
What about how about another one?

88
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:39,420
Going back in that was beautiful though

89
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,179
I have sweating through my clothes

90
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,650
And I mean that in like in real life and in fake life

91
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,809
So it makes sense that I would be like this

92
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,929
You'll have a series of choices. I hope you choose wisely

93
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,690
and

94
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,690
When you have these choices to make

95
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,559
I really hope that

96
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,329
I feel like shit

97
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,730
I hope that when you make these choices that you do them in a way that it can succeed all of us

98
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,599
I think I need to fucking lie down

99
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,460
Um, what was I saying?

100
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,340
I wanted to uh go for a hot jog or something

101
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,739
I feel awful

102
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:41,219
I'm getting like a bad headache and shit. I'm like really tired

103
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,519
I really just kind of want to like that's probably

104
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,119
There's over here. I think this is a that's a good spot. I sure went

105
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:38,519
Oh, it was fucking hell. I feel like somebody just punched me in the face like three times

106
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:47,829
I feel like I just I had this weird vision this weird dream with this like sleep paralysis demons just surrounding me

107
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:05,139
Ow my knees

108
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:09,050
What's that? What is this?

109
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:14,170
Is this a what was a stool?

110
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:18,889
I don't like that there. That's not where that should be. I don't like that

111
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,800
I don't like it

112
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,219
But i'll tell you what I do like. I like sassy sunglasses

113
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,190
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom in this?

114
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,679
I am

115
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:49,619
Disgusting someone please help me. Can I please just put me into a bathing scenario?

116
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,099
I am here washing my hands desperately

117
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,590
Let please let me bathe

118
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:58,969
Put me into a scenario where I can clean my body

119
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,889
trash

120
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:10,260
Sink

121
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:16,170
Oh, I need to clean myself. You can't just let me fucking feel like this

122
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:31,460
Give me a break

123
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:39,769
Uh, I better I hope that nobody comes over because this is absolutely revolting

124
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:45,619
What if my mother shows up? Huh? What if what if my mother decides to come in here?

125
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,760
You think you know what she'd say?

126
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,880
She'd be disgusted. She would put her face in the air and she would run away

127
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,699
What if my mother shows up?

128
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:58,860
What if my mother shows up? All right

129
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:08,619

Okay. Okay. I guess I have to go to that from now

131
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:20,059
Just on the stool now i'm peeing on the stool. We gotta move the stool. I don't want to pee on the stool

132
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:37,929
Very good, very good. Very good. Very good. I can't even use that. That's supposed to be a place to sit down

133
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,730
That's a place for me to sit and relax

134
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:46,469
Can I can I take a shower?

135
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,079

00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:06,389
I'm waiting to go in the shower

139
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:12,150
Now I don't want to go to work. I want to go in the shower. You know, I can't go in front of people like this

140
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,170

Don't make me like take a shit in the toilet for like a second. I haven't even taken shit yet

Well, maybe you do right maybe I do sometimes

151
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:54,179
Sometimes you just gotta let the water hit you right in the face right in the face. There it is

152
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,619
That feels so much better. Oh my goodness

153
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,260
I'm not naked anymore

154
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
All right. We're good. We're good. We're fine. We're fine

155
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,400
Oh, I feel so much better. I'm fucking hungry though

156
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,800
If i'm not going to go to work and i'm not going to make money then you got to make me food

157
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400

You make get I want food and I want it

162
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,590
I don't need to go to the fucking bathroom again

163
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,949
Something's going on with this toilet. Something's going on with this toilet. So, okay

164
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,070
All right. The toilet's like pissing at me. The toilet is effectively peeing at me and um

165
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,750
I didn't even sit on it. It's just broken

166
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,469
The toilet's broken

167
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,469

02:21:09,649 --> 02:21:11,649
I could sit on it though. I could hang out on it

678
02:21:15,729 --> 02:21:22,530
The side just sunk. Oh, that's what this is for. That's what fell out. That was the very loud noise that I heard

679
02:21:24,979 --> 02:21:26,979
I heard an incredibly loud sound

680
02:21:31,469 --> 02:21:33,469
This bed is fucked. I

02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:37,229

687
02:22:00,239 --> 02:22:02,639
The thing I left at the shop that I had a consignment

688
02:22:05,579 --> 02:22:06,700

02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:38,799
feeding feeding you money

694
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:40,959
So you can make the right decision

695
02:22:44,110 --> 02:22:46,110
I don't think I could even put this together if I wanted to

696
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:59,600
That's the last part of the day if I hear the fire i'm coming over there. I swear to god

697
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:06,290
Oh, it's just the bottom. All right, then I could no this is the fucking this is a train wreck under

698
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:09,309
by the way

699
02:23:09,309 --> 02:23:11,309
This is an air mattress

700
02:23:11,870 --> 02:23:14,239
This is not even a bed

701
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:16,399
Look at what happened under here

702
02:23:16,719 --> 02:23:18,719
What happened under look at this?

703
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:21,170
Do you see what I have to deal with right now?

704
02:23:24,219 --> 02:23:26,219
This is I can't put this together

705
02:23:28,989 --> 02:23:30,989
I'm gonna sleep on it like that

706
02:23:35,979 --> 02:23:37,979
It's just absolutely destroyed

707
02:23:38,139 --> 02:23:41,020
I don't know if you guys can hear it, but it was seriously it was like

708
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:45,020
It was like an explosion back here. Like it just fell apart in their hands

709
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:49,260
work

710
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,700
Oh is it

711
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:52,059
type of work

712
02:23:52,059 --> 02:23:54,510
I see the car pulling up

713
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:55,790
Hey

714
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:57,790

715
02:23:59,809 --> 02:24:00,770

02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:04,739
They're not are they on the road? I don't even hear them

717
02:24:07,389 --> 02:24:08,590
Oh there

718
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:11,629
There you are. Don't worry about what you see over here, by the way

719
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:14,770
Just don't don't drive far enough to see by my driveway

720
02:24:17,389 --> 02:24:40,299
Let's go

721
02:24:40,299 --> 02:24:49,200
Yeah, this is a dick move. No, that was a dick move what you did

722
02:24:53,180 --> 02:24:57,420
Not everybody not everybody thinks that's funny. So I just want to let you know what we'll see at the party on saturday

723
02:24:57,500 --> 02:25:00,319
You're still gonna go

724
02:25:05,219 --> 02:25:07,819
I can't

725
02:25:07,819 --> 02:25:12,850
I gotta pee bad

726
02:25:12,850 --> 02:25:16,049
You know, it's funny. Even if I wanted to move this I wouldn't be able to

727
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:23,739
I'm not going through the window that hurt even if I wanted to move this it would be hard for one person

728
02:25:29,709 --> 02:25:38,989
I don't know what to do. I need to get in there

729
02:25:39,629 --> 02:25:48,829
What do I do help?

730
02:25:48,829 --> 02:25:52,270
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Help me. Excuse me

731
02:25:53,229 --> 02:25:55,229
Ha help. Ah

02:25:56,030 --> 02:26:23,870
Right. Oh even like

733
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:32,540
There's a there's a water fountain over there that I hear I heard a water fountain

734
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,899
Hey, how about hey, hey, I wonder if it flushes

735
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:49,940
That's so stupid

736
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:51,940
Oh, i'm not having a good time though

737
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:54,639
Give me something to play with

738
02:26:54,639 --> 02:27:00,940
It's so much fun

739
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:04,059
I I don't I wouldn't go back in there, but I just don't want to go in the window

740
02:27:07,659 --> 02:27:09,579
I will this fit over me

741
02:27:09,579 --> 02:27:11,020
No, I don't think so

742
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:13,920
I could go like this

743
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,389
No

744
02:27:15,389 --> 02:27:17,549
This is kind of fun what i'm doing, but not really

745
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:28,079
It could it this actually could be a hat but i'm not I somebody just said it could be a toilet seat

746
02:27:28,079 --> 02:27:29,840
It's not going to be that

747
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,840
I i'm not going to use this as a toilet seat

748
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:35,500
Oh, this is kind of funny hat. This is a funny hat. I like it

749
02:27:36,299 --> 02:27:43,139
This is a funny hat

750
02:27:43,379 --> 02:27:48,100
I can't even block the door. I could very easily just get in there. I could

751
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:53,940
but

752
02:27:53,940 --> 02:27:56,690
Make food I can't

753
02:27:59,870 --> 02:28:01,809

754
02:28:01,809 --> 02:28:04,530
Just see what if I can I eat these these flowers edible?

755
02:28:05,329 --> 02:28:12,139
I don't think I can even tight. Can I at least can I eat one of these?

756
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:15,739
What happens to my to my uh hunger level if I eat one of these?

757
02:28:16,379 --> 02:28:25,629
Hold on. Let me see

758
02:28:25,629 --> 02:28:27,860
Ow

759
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:29,379
It's like stung me

760
02:28:29,379 --> 02:28:32,239
All right. What if I take like a bite?

761
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:44,290
I'll take a big bite

762
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:49,899
It's not good

763
02:28:49,899 --> 02:28:52,459
I I can't go. All right. I'm climbing the window again

764
02:28:53,649 --> 02:28:55,809
No, I don't want to climb in the window because then I won't get the comfortable bed

765
02:29:07,059 --> 02:29:10,819
No, it's I I got I don't want to get hurt. This is day one

766
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:16,959
Oh shit

767
02:29:16,959 --> 02:29:18,959
But these have been out here for like five days

768
02:29:20,579 --> 02:29:22,659
Haven't these been out here for like at least five days, right?

769
02:29:23,379 --> 02:29:32,850
Can I actually eat these or is that gonna be bad for like what if I just pretend to

770
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:38,700
I don't know how long these actually have been here for

771
02:29:43,090 --> 02:29:47,629
Now i've had another bite

772
02:29:47,629 --> 02:29:50,899
Oh, that was really good

773
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:55,760
I want to just like jump in

774
02:30:06,719 --> 02:30:09,780
What?

775
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:11,459
What are you doing?

776
02:30:11,459 --> 02:30:14,739
You want me to run run run away

777
02:30:17,579 --> 02:30:19,579
Like now you want me to run away

778
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:29,739
That that's

779
02:30:29,739 --> 02:34:31,360
I can run down the street. I can't get back inside

780
02:34:32,659 --> 02:34:36,299
That's very obvious. This is a nice house

781
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:41,360
How am I going to get back in here run away?

782
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:43,520
I've been walking around the neighborhood for the last like six hours

783
02:34:45,010 --> 02:34:47,809
You know people have come out and just looked at me and been like what the hell is this guy doing out here?

784
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:52,479
Seems you have chosen to upgrade the house

785
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:57,149
Uh, and what does that mean?

786
02:34:57,149 --> 02:34:59,729
Uh, that means that that is the end of the tutorial

787
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:02,299
so

788
02:35:02,299 --> 02:35:07,340
Thank you for playing in our tutorial version of this game. Hopefully it worked out pretty well. I think it did

789
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:10,299
uh and in

790
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:13,299
Two days

791
02:35:13,299 --> 02:35:15,299
That is where the real game starts

792
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:16,979
so

793
02:35:16,979 --> 02:35:22,899
I this was a ton of fun. Let me look at the right camera right here. Here we are. I had a ton of fun

794
02:35:23,299 --> 02:35:26,659
Thanks for watching everybody special huge huge huge scam

795
02:35:29,459 --> 02:35:33,219
Well, I want to say thanks everybody watching we have two more streams of this

796
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:36,100
And it's going to get even more wild

797
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:40,100
Uh, I we're literally going to dial it even higher and higher every day

798
02:35:41,469 --> 02:35:44,270
Uh, so i'm keep talking to the wrong cameras. I don't know what's wrong with

799
02:35:45,149 --> 02:35:49,309
We're going to dial it up every day every single day. It's going to get more ridiculous

800
02:35:50,030 --> 02:35:54,350
So we want to make sure that everything worked as intended before we got started

801
02:35:54,909 --> 02:35:56,030
so

802
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:59,389
I cannot actually get into this house. So i'm not going to even try

803
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:03,149
uh trial version of full game unlocked

804
02:36:04,190 --> 02:36:08,350
Special huge. Thank you to twitch for partnering with us and a coinbase

805
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:14,500
Without them this would never have happened and there's way more to see over the next two or three days

806
02:36:15,139 --> 02:36:19,780
So what that means you'll see in the next few days, but we we got everything

807
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:23,389
What was that?

808
02:36:23,389 --> 02:36:27,709
You paid to end the stream you paid to end the tutorial is what you did

809
02:36:28,979 --> 02:36:31,540
Uh, but yeah, i'm really really happy

810
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:37,139
I really think that everything worked out pretty well in this kind of tutorial version of the game. So i'm very very excited

811
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:39,059
I hope you had fun

812
02:36:39,059 --> 02:36:40,340
We got a lot of data

813
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:44,180
So we got a lot of things that we might have to work on and check out and see how they played out

814
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:47,299
But uh for the most part, I think it was pretty fun

815
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:50,459
So we'll see

816
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:53,020
So we'll see with the upgraded house in a couple of days

817
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:57,040
With even more wacky wild stuff

818
02:36:59,409 --> 02:37:02,690
Thank you everybody. We'll see in a couple days. Thanks for playing the tutorial

819
02:37:04,239 --> 02:37:06,559
I can't go back in there

820
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:10,159
Huge shout out to twitch huge shout out to coinbase for letting us do this shit

821
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,120
Huge thanks without them. It's impossible

822
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:18,100
We'll see full days
