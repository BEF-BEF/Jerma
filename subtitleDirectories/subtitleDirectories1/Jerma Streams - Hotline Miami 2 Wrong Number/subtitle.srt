1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:07,660
Hello everybody. Sorry I'm late again. I said last night I was like, you know, we're not gonna be

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,119
late today, but then I had to get some stuff ready. I had to do some stuff like it typically is.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,079
I want to be starting at like 3 33 ish pm pacific time, but man am I pushing that forward now.

4
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:28,899
This is an outlier though. Don't expect streams to start like this.

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,649
Really gonna be trying to stay consistently like we were for the first couple of months here

6
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:43,020
at like 5 to 6 pm eastern around like three ish pm pacific. Oh I got the wrong,

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,659
what's even on the title right now? Bird? How is this done? Pretty, oh fuck, hold on.

8
00:00:53,259 --> 00:01:03,509
Hotline, yes this is dog. I don't know. I just, I need it for it just to, for a second. I'll

9
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:11,689
change it in a second. There we go. Okay, is it changed? Because I want to make sure that

10
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:20,299
the VOD's gonna be all fucked up if I don't do that. That's, that was a, I had a tenth

11
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,969
of a second to figure that. I'm gonna change that title, don't worry. I'm gonna play hotline

12
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:31,609
Miami 2 tonight. Oh I need to put these teabags somewhere. I have two teabags that I don't know

13
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,959
what to do with and I'm not putting them on my nice desk. I guess they can go right here.

14
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,379
Hello, yes this is dog. Yeah I know that's a terrible fucking shitty title.

15
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:55,420
Just give me like, just give me like a 15 second minute. I gotta get these teabags out

16
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,750
of here. Go through, right? Well I'll just get rid of them when I take a break here in

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,750
a little bit. But anyways, I hope you guys are doing well. Let me just make a tweet and

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:03:45,500
we will get started. Give me one minute. Okay, as the motorcycle goes by. So yeah, hotline Miami 2.

19
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,979
Welcome everybody. I'm gonna make sure from the birdhouse yesterday, the chair isn't on

20
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:56,860
the right spot. I need to move that. Why is it? All right, there we go. Is that better?

21
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,979
Does that feel better? My mouse pad, this is a gamer game. I gotta make sure my mouse

22
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:15,020
pad's in the right place. Oh, sorry I bumped ya. Okay, think. I think I'm ready. How's the bird doing?

23
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:22,620
Uh, bird's doing all right. What bird? What? Oh the birdhouse. Okay, I got a bird now.

24
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,759
I'm never gonna finish this game. Well I finished the last one. Is this one

25
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:42,339
worse than the last one? All right, I'm gonna do a new game. I'm ready. I'm gonna get the

26
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:53,879
first act coming in here. And you need the audio too, don't you? Uh, it's kind of quiet,

27
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,709
like very quiet. For some reason. I'll put it on in a minute here. Hold on, don't worry.

28
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,610
Uh, man, this party stinks. I fucking hate these people. Who invited all these

29
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:15,500
morons. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Uh, what do you guys think about tonight? We gonna do it?

30
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:28,470
Um, I have my door. I gotta close my door. Okay, there we go. He's talking about chat.

31
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:38,569
Where's the face cam? No, I'll, I'll, just, I'll, god damn it. Do you guys really want a camera?

32
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,459
Do I have to put a face cam on? All right, well, let me get to the end of the cut scene. Just

33
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,350
wait. What do you guys think about tonight? We gonna do it? I don't see why not. I'm sick

34
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,610
of this shit. Yeah, let's do it. Uh, I like the duck bill guy's my favorite. The weapons

35
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,939
are in the car, right? So we are actually doing this. I thought he was gonna scream. He

36
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,069
has a screaming face. Game audio. I know, I know. I just gotta get to the end of the

37
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,819
cut scene. I can't, if I hit escape, then I'm gonna like fuck it all up, aren't I?

38
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:18,540
Let's do it. All right, here we go. Why was that so loud? Why is this so much louder than

39
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:37,129
the game? What the fuck? All right, this, is that better? Don't ask me why the MNU

40
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,980
for some reason is five times louder than the actual video game. I feel like I'm shooting

41
00:06:42,980 --> 00:07:05,500
you guys with a fucking laser. How's that? It's a little better, right? Louder. Ow! Uh,

42
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:13,540
I don't, I can't, why can I not go any louder? What the fuck is happening? Why is my volume

43
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:23,480
mixer so fucked up? Does that help? No, dude, I'm at max fucking volume on Windows.

44
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:38,939
Well, that's okay. Odd, but whatever. All right, so that's, I guess that's as long

45
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:45,980
as I can fucking make it. That's what it's gonna have to be like, apparently. All right,

46
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:53,769
here we go. Uh, party sucks. W A S D, just like the last game. It's got puking in there.

47
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,360
I can leave through here, get in the van. Ow, it's so much louder. What the hell is happening right

48
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,560
now? What is going on? It just shouldn't be like this.

49
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,660
All right, what in the name of God was that all about?

50
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:29,459
That can't be that fucking loud. That's too loud. I think that's a reasonable level.

51
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Maybe like one more. All right, I don't even need a fucking tutorial. I'm a goddamn natural.

52
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:52,779
Look at how loud this is. Are you sure about this? What the fuck? Turn on face cam.

53
00:08:53,419 --> 00:09:11,639
Oh my God, fine. Jesus Christ. I gotta go through this door, I think. Yep, I think it's

54
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:29,940
okay. How do I open the door? Can you not just open doors like this? No, you can. Something's

55
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,850
wrong with my audio sync. I can't really fix it, so I'm gonna have to deal with it

56
00:09:35,850 --> 00:10:03,429
for now. Ooh, that hurt. There's no bullets in that gun. What the fuck? How many bullets

57
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:07,590
do I have? Where do I see? Oh, just empty. Combo beginner, nice. Okay, that's cool.

58
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:35,000
Got it. Ooh, I almost didn't get it. No, give me that. What are you guys saying? Get it? Okay.

59
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:52,940
Ah! Oh my God. Okay, I gotta pay attention. Oh, shift. I forgot I could do shift. I forgot

60
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:11,019
about that. Damn it. It's gonna go fucking fast, man. Fuck it. No, I'm not. Damn it. Holy shit,

61
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:20,039
how did I stay alive? All right, slow it down. This is like kind of hard for the first

62
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:28,889
level. I guess I could go in the left room. I need a melee weapon. I'm alerting the whole

63
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:53,129
horde. Okay, that works. Who the fuck are you? Oh God. Play one more guy and then

64
00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:05,059
that's it, right? Just one more guy? All right, got it. That was fucking ridiculous.

65
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:24,149
I got these bags, though. Whatever. Go to car. I don't... Where is the...

66
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:42,899
Was the car down a level or what? No, it's right there. What are you guys saying? Entire stream

67
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:53,879
is broken. What's wrong with my stream? I don't know what you guys are talking about, but

68
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,399
I don't know if there's a problem with the stream that I can't really fix it, so

69
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:15,940
I'm sorry. Happy Halloween, sir. I'll give you 14 tithes or your pizzas are on the counter.

70
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Okay, cool. Enjoy your meal and watch out for ghosts tonight. Okay, bye. More free food.

71
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:40,840
That's pretty cool. I like that. What? I don't understand. Turn off the cam? What the

72
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:50,220
fuck are you guys talking about? Fine. Turn cam off. What's going on? Turn it back on and

73
00:13:50,220 --> 00:14:14,980
sync it. Is it fixed now? Is it better? Don't even look good. Are you... Okay. In a

74
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:25,909
stressful day, you wouldn't believe what they have been doing. Stand up. I...

75
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:40,809
Stand up. I don't understand. Stand like... I don't get it. What? What's happening? Stand up.

76
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:59,750
It's fixed. Jesus. I don't know... Oh, this is falling. Hold on. Hold on. I fucked it

77
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:19,399
up. There we go. Okay. There we go. Nice. I believe what they've been doing. I should

78
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:33,590
probably go home and get some sleep. All right, you have a nice night. You too,

79
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:42,950
sweetheart. Okay. I don't know what that means, but that's fine. Go to the car,

80
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:53,639
I guess. I don't... I mean, I think I have to... Second scene. I... I'm playing

81
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:06,889
without fucking headphones tonight, guys. I don't like the sounds. They scare me. Got

82
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:28,179
it. Got it. That's blocking the... That's blocking the shit. Hold on. Got it. No,

83
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:37,799
wait. Watch out for the guy in the room. I gotta be careful here. Sound effects

84
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,519
are too loud. The music is... I... Hold on. I can fix it. Hold on. Let me

85
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:48,700
give it... Give me a second. Maybe that'll help. Better? What happened to

86
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,320
my cursor? Okay. There we go. I think that's good. Yeah. I think we're

87
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,399
good. One guy in here. Two guys, actually. Let's go... Let's try to get a

88
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,339
door and then smash, right? Oh, that guy didn't see me. How? Empty. Empty.

89
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:17,660
Empty. We're good. There we go. Up the floor and we're good. That should get us

90
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,720
up there. This way. Oh, I thought that... I didn't think that was a wall.

91
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:47,319
Oops-a-daisy. Fuck. Fuck. Damn it. Oh my god. This is too stressful

92
00:17:47,319 --> 00:18:09,160
for me. Can you believe this shit? I think I got him. Ah, I just gave it

93
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,630
to him. Oh, that was close. That was real...

94
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:43,029
Anymore? I don't think there's anymore. Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

95
00:18:43,029 --> 00:19:08,299
Fuck! Oh my god! I blown it! Oh! Fuck. All right, I'll get it. I'll be fine.

96
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:15,980
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. I got it. All right. Let me think

97
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,900
about this logically here. I'm gonna say punch through door, kick guy,

98
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,630
get them both in two shots. One shot, three shot. Got it. Nice.

99
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,789
All right. Just... How many guys down here? Just the two, right?

100
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,599
Oh, come on. That was lucky. All right. Oh, we got one guy.

101
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:46,259
What about down there, though? I'm scared to even go down there. It's just

102
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:53,000
one, two, three. I should get them very quickly here. The door got the fucking

103
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:14,569
way again. Got it. Okay. Go to the car. Well,

104
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:23,210
this isn't good. Do I have to fight this? Am I in trouble here?

105
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,460
Drop your weapon and get down on the ground now. Don't shoot. I'm

106
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:37,289
detective. Here's my badge. I'm sorry, sir. Lower your weapons, boys.

107
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:45,609
What's the situation in there? Look for yourself. It's a bloodbath in there.

108
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:50,539
Man, sometimes I hate this city. What about the car? Okay.

109
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:56,099
That's kind of interesting. I go to the car. Which car? My car or their car?

110
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:27,700
Okay. There it is. Nice. C+. All right. That's fine. It's first

111
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:46,650
level. C plus streamer strikes again. That was the worst joke this year.

112
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,410
That was the last... What do you mean? You don't know what you're talking

113
00:21:51,369 --> 00:22:03,049
about. Turn the face cam back on. I'll turn it back on

114
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:12,490
when I feel like it's necessary to turn back on. Another murder case, huh?

115
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,339
Yeah. It looks like you've got a serial killer on your hands. Same MO as the

116
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,660
guy you found last week. Message and all.

117
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,339
I'm innocent. They forced me to do it. Yeah, right. I haven't heard that

118
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,269
before. The guy must be some kind of psycho, huh?

119
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:35,990
Creeps me out. Guess it'll make the press happy, though.

120
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:58,150
Guess it'll make it happy. Okay. I don't know. I have no idea.

121
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:00,549
Seems they need... Oh, look. It's a love for the...

122
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:15,910
This just seems a bit too standard. No gore details. God, the city sure makes

123
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,430
your skin thick, doesn't it? I was born with thick skin. Have you

124
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,539
guys found any clues? Not really. He got his throat slit.

125
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,769
Haven't found the murder weapon yet. No fingerprints. No witnesses. Nothing.

126
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:38,599
I'll let you know. Anything turns up. All right. Fucking bye.

127
00:23:38,599 --> 00:24:00,250
Bye. You do that. I'll head down to the station and get started on the

128
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:10,180
paperwork. All right. Have a nice night, sir.

129
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:41,539
Yeah, we'll see about that. I don't know about whether I...

130
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:55,740
What? Who knows? I think it's a kind of an issue.

131
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:25,019
Yeah. I'm sorry. You're a fucking dork? Hey, I'm just trying to enjoy Hotline

132
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:50,700
Miami 2 with camp tonight. Yeah. Let's see what happens here.

133
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,430
Oh, what the hell? Who am I? A new character?

134
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:05,930
Good day. This is Eric from Miami Auto Repairies. I'm calling to tell you

135
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,339
that we have finished service. Hello, who is this? Let me talk to

136
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:15,859
your boss, okay? Swing on by Northworth 12th Avenue place

137
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,140
and pick. Hey, I'm talking here. We guarantee the

138
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:27,289
best service in town. Don't you hang up on me, damn it.

139
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,740
Show some goddamn respect. This looks like fat me.

140
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:50,500
Let's watch me fucking ace this round. So this is a new

141
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:59,859
character? Third scene. Hard news. This is where it happened. I gotta

142
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,180
get the fucking cam on for this one, you know what I'm saying?

143
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,579
Lethal throws. Yeah, let's get it on. Let's fucking jam this.

144
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:44,680
This side over here. There's a window. Oh, they can shoot through windows.

145
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,849
Somebody's there. Nah, I gotta get these two. Hit the guy

146
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:57,299
at the door when he comes out. Take his gun. He's slow to kill with

147
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,500
melee. Lethal throws though. I gotta remember

148
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,859
that. Lethal throws. Lethal throws. Whoa!

149
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:23,380
Wow, fucking window. Actually, fuck it. All right. What about the window?

150
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:31,420
That can see right through the window, right? One guy up here. Guy through the

151
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,500
window. I'm gonna get the guy through his own window.

152
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,450
Like that. One more bullet for the guy in here with the gun. Watch this. Ready.

153
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,059
Three, two, one, action. Whoa! Okay, I'm fine.

154
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:54,940
Ah! Oh, my fucking keys. I hit caps lock. Lethal throw is... fuck. All right.

155
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Get up with the guy over here. Yeah, I had the same idea, dickhead.

156
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:19,000
All right, guy through the window. That's not a lethal throw.

157
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,259
I hit the door. Okay, that's fine. Anybody? Is there another guy in this?

158
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:31,180
Right here. Oh, that didn't go through. Fuck, it's empty now. He's coming for me.

159
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,849
He's coming for me. No! Pick up the... Oh, fuck!

160
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:42,039
Okay, I'm fine. I want that gun on the ground right there.

161
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:49,339
Get... get it! Okay, I got it. Okay, who do we got for guns?

162
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:54,170
I don't think there's anybody left with a gun. There's only the guy up there

163
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,970
with the gun. There's a window. So we're gonna have to go... we're gonna

164
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,819
have to snipe somebody. This guy right here. Let's see if

165
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:03,940
I can get him. Okay, got that guy. Did it pull anybody

166
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:19,910
else? I'm still paranoid for this guy right here.

167
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,869
Dammit, I was even trying to shoot you! I was trying to shoot him!

168
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:26,230
Oh, that guy's a gun. All right, I'm going the other way.

169
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:35,269
Didn't get a double, but that's fine. Where's he going? All the way around?

170
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:45,460
Give me your gun. Uncam on each corner of the screen.

171
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:57,289
No, I can't do that. I'm gonna get sniped by somebody else. I'm gonna be

172
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:03,259
so angry about it. Holy fuck, that was so panic

173
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,660
inducing. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

174
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:14,220
All right, anything else in here? Give me a fresh gun.

175
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:24,140
What else I can grab? People are gonna get so angry with me.

176
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,019
Dude, you missed the mask! Go get the mask, dude!

177
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:42,970
Did I really hit the plant right there? What do we got? We got a guy with a gun.

178
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:52,900
Watch out for the guy. Get the seat through the glass.

179
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,059
Ah, and I didn't get shot. Holy fuck, how? Holy fuck, I'm being so stupid

180
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,299
right now. Okay, stop, stop. Cool down.

181
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,910
This guy right through the glass. You stupid idiot!

182
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:28,490
Oh, damn it. Oh, now I'm going too fast. I can slow down.

183
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,930
Fuck, I had it. I just had it too. I had it. I had it.

184
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:51,480
I think I got two people there. Holy fuck. Let me get a closer look.

185
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,680
There's nobody with a gun in there. There's a guy with a gun up there.

186
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,900
What happened? Why did I just spin around like that? That was wild.

187
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,190
Guy, there's a guy. What was that? Why did I just like spin

188
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:17,720
fucking around like 180 degrees? Turned my aimbot on for some reason.

189
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:27,829
I'm not using one of those. Ass right here. All right, one guy here.

190
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:30,869
Sorry, he's gonna come all the way around and I'm gonna throw it at him.

191
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:36,259
What happened? Is he dead? Is that a lethal throw? What the fuck did I do?

192
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:41,660
Oh my god, what did I do? Oh my fucking god, what the hell?

193
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,140
Does every throw kill? All right, I'm sorry. I have to turn

194
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,859
the music down. It's so loud in my ear and it's

195
00:33:48,859 --> 00:34:07,380
fucking my brain. All right, here we go. It's the, I shouldn't,

196
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:13,179
don't even lock on to somebody. He's gonna come through. Shoot him.

197
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:25,900
My goodness, Jeremy. Get good. Get good. You know what I mean? That's what people

198
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,019
say nowadays. They go, get good. No, hold on. It's better than that.

199
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:32,780
They go, get good. I can't do it. I drank too much fucking tea and my

200
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:38,380
like throat is all closed up. That means you're allergic to tea.

201
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:55,980
I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay, that guy's a gun.

202
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,420
How safe am I here? This is only rebel chill.

203
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,659
This is only rebel deadedated rare. Right? Somebody laughing at that. Wasn't

204
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:26,380
that funny? Fuck. Yeah, remember that like funny

205
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,250
video? That like, that was like, cute video.

206
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:48,760
I don't have a fucking gun. Oh, what do I do about this? What do I do?

207
00:35:48,760 --> 00:36:04,920
Still throws. Okay, we're good. That was a real life reaction.

208
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,340
Yeah, dude, if somebody is chasing you with a knife,

209
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,780
stabbing forward at you, you're gonna go, oh no, what the fuck do I do?

210
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:23,030
That was a real reaction. Is that it? Can I throw the briefcase at him?

211
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:29,579
This fucking boomer using auto lock. I was told to use that.

212
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,260
I said, somebody said, use auto lock. It helps sometimes. I don't use it all

213
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,610
the time. There you go. That's the C plus

214
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,170
content you signed up for. Now, okay, like a one out of ten

215
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,210
stream is if somebody has a black screen and they were just sleeping,

216
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,690
right? Two out of ten stream is if somebody is

217
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,449
streaming themselves sleeping with the camera on. Three out of ten stream is

218
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:57,460
building a birdhouse. Four out of ten stream is playing

219
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,500
Hotline Miami with auto lock. Just wait till you fucking see a five out of

220
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,010
ten stream. You're not even gonna know what hit

221
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:29,829
you. I just went back up. How am I locked? I know it's out here.

222
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:34,500
All right, it's gonna be more than a C plus. If that's the case, this is a

223
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,360
seven out of ten stream. That's a seven that that's a seven

224
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,400
out of ten stream or sixty nine and ten. Seven to one.

225
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:53,500
Got a new mask. Ervin. 20 face cams are right. I will crash my computer.

226
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:02,900
Hi there. Welcome. What can I help you with? I'd like to get a tattoo.

227
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:09,110
Right, you got anything particular in mind? All right, so every time I see

228
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,579
this guy's face, I keep imagining, I keep seeing like a

229
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:18,550
hippopotamus mouth. Like where his chin is, that's the

230
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,070
top of the hippopotamus's mouth and there's a big bottom half that's

231
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,579
underneath that. I want an old dixie right here. Okay, sure.

232
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:33,059
Let me see. Right, how does this Friday sound? That's what you look like.

233
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:39,739
I don't look like this. Friday, what do you mean? You can't do it now?

234
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:43,980
It has to be today. It's a special occasion today. I'm celebrating.

235
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,940
Sorry boss, can't help you. We're all booked for days.

236
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,869
Does that so? What kind of business are you running here? You just lost

237
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:55,909
yourself a customer. You Russian asshole. Whatever you say, boss.

238
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:09,909
Yeah, just you guys wait. Just you guys wait for the Bionic Boomer stream.

239
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:14,070
It's gonna be a lot of fun. I'd like to welcome our next guest on the show,

240
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,969
famous from critically acclaimed movies such as Blue Ocean, The Calm, and Land

241
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:23,960
of Trees. Here's Martin Brown. Hi Martin, how are you?

242
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,539
I'm good. Now your latest film is a bit of a step in a new direction for

243
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,539
you. A lot of people are surprised by this.

244
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:35,659
Some are even calling you a sellout. Bionic Boomer tonight

245
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:44,010
or Riot. Do you understand that I can't get keyboard pants and like laser eye

246
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,489
tracking devices that this is gonna take like a couple of weeks to put

247
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:54,389
together. A lot of people are surprised by this.

248
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:58,329
Some are calling you a sellout. What's your response to that? A sellout,

249
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,190
huh? How do you mean? Well some are saying

250
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,510
that Midnight Animal is just another slasher flick.

251
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:11,380
That's not how I see it. I have wanted to do this for a long time.

252
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,659
Kill kids. Strangle them. Beat people's heads in.

253
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,179
Rip their eyes out. Just listen to them. Oh my god.

254
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:26,179
What the fuck? I finally get to do that. Okay.

255
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:32,230
Don't look at me like that. What? I say this is a dream, right?

256
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,670
What do you mean? This is all, this is just a dream, right? I'm not sure I

257
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:44,550
follow. Okay pause. You think this is a

258
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,780
dream? Well then maybe it's time to wake up.

259
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:54,300
Who are you? Who am I? I'm not the one being interviewed here, am I?

260
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,750
I think I should be the one asking the questions. This movie you're making, you

261
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,929
know how it ends. I believe there's a pretty big twist at

262
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:08,940
the end. I doubt you'll like it. In fact, I don't think anyone will. Maybe

263
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,019
you ought to get out before it's too late.

264
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:15,019
I don't think so. You really enjoy hurting other people, don't you?

265
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:21,340
It's just a film. Just a film, huh? That's one way to look at it.

266
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,739
Oh and then right after that, Batman and Superman are like shitting in a

267
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:28,869
stall together. And like you can hear the loud fart

268
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:40,809
poop noises. Nobody, nobody knows what I was just

269
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:45,940
doing there. What are you talking about? That's,

270
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,920
wow, I must be out of touch. That was a robot chicken segment and we moved to

271
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,960
another one. Like don't, what are you talking about?

272
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:05,400
Don't you remember like robot chicken? It would do like the shh and change to

273
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,719
like the superheroes that are really cool but

274
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:16,809
they just like fart in each other and like get,

275
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:23,179
just get it, right? Does anybody get it? You generally aren't in your head.

276
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:30,889
Are you sure? It looks like the police is here.

277
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:34,980
The girl must have told on you. You better go along obediently, they'll take

278
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,860
you to her. What's that you want? Well that's what you want, isn't it?

279
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:47,619
Click. Hold it right there. Why am I wearing this mask?

280
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,260
We're here to arrest you. You need to come with us. We'll take you down

281
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,119
to the station. Do you understand what I'm saying?

282
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,730
Apparently not. You can't tell me that robot chicken

283
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,460
is a boomer show. That, that was, that's like still on the air.

284
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,050
And if it's not, it was off the air like five years ago.

285
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,260
You know what you've been up to and you're gonna fry for it. Girls upstairs

286
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,099
giving us her full statement right now.

287
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:19,380
It's gonna be on their way down here for you. Until then you're stuck with

288
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,820
me. I'd like to ask why did you do

289
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,780
what you did? Do you even know you, you don't even

290
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,219
know yourself? Do you, what, can the phone fucking, somebody pick up the phone?

291
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:36,550
Look at me. You're fucked. Completely fucked in the head.

292
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,630
Aren't you? Why else would anyone be killing kids in a pig's mask, huh?

293
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,329
Oh my fucking god. It's the phone. You should answer it.

294
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:50,250
I'll say it again. There is no phone. I don't see no phone and I don't hear no

295
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,329
phone, okay? It's just a figment of your

296
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,329
imagination, you hear me? You're insane. A maniac. And soon enough

297
00:43:56,329 --> 00:44:03,400
you will pay for your crimes. The telephone. You're not gonna answer.

298
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:12,070
There's just no point talking to you, is there? What the fuck?

299
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,309
You know what needs to be done. It's not like even looking. It's like he

300
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:28,039
wants you to click. Do I, is this the, what the

301
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:31,800
fuck is this game? The last game was like answering phone calls

302
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:39,219
and like fighting people. Why do I have to be this like creepy guy?

303
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:58,440
And like, anything else? This one has a strange elaborate story.

304
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,380
Whoa, I could break the toilet. I know it was a TV, you know what I'm saying.

305
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:14,150
You guys are like inside my head, you know what I mean by that.

306
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:20,920
I, get off of him. What are you doing? Hi.

307
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:29,659
Okay, all right. Both dead, right? I'm not gonna shoot any weapons. I'm not

308
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:32,380
gonna shoot a gun. Let me just see if I can do this without.

309
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:46,789
You guys coming around here? Am I safe? Oh, not safe, not safe. Oh, damn it.

310
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:50,150
I would have had it potentially too there. Fuck, what am I doing?

311
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:54,059
What about up there? Let me try going, no. I'm gonna wait for this patrol to go

312
00:45:54,059 --> 00:46:01,780
by and I'm gonna go up. Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no. I

313
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:13,829
get a better idea. Never mind.

314
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,110
Yeah, I used to get shot right in the fucking face. It was a decent idea

315
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:26,389
and it still is. I'm gonna try it again. Give me a fucking break.

316
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:42,579
How did it, you don't even notice that you, how do you not notice this?

317
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:47,239
What the fuck? How did you not notice that?

318
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,840
Why do you have the intelligence of the orcs from Shadow of Mordor? Come

319
00:46:50,840 --> 00:47:11,349
on. Where the fuck did you guys even

320
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:21,579
come from? I'm gonna do that. Shit, I'm gonna

321
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:31,210
throw it at him and then I'm gonna sit in this room.

322
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,980
Okay, give me the gun. I have items in here now.

323
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,139
Now it's just a question of trying to get this done.

324
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:42,179
Okay, so now I can get, I should be able to cleanly kill this guy right

325
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:52,539
here without a problem, right? One, two, three, go. Guy in this

326
00:47:52,539 --> 00:48:07,030
room, I'm gonna get him. Holy fuck you! Okay, calm down. The

327
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,110
trolls are gonna, I'm gonna forget about them.

328
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:15,590
What about over there? Yeah, this guy that way.

329
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:28,969
These guys don't have guns though. Oh shit.

330
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:36,710
No! God damn it. God damn it. Oh come on man, what the hell was I

331
00:48:36,710 --> 00:49:02,090
doing there? There's only a couple guys left. Oh

332
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:09,750
you fucking door. Oh you fucking door. Is that guy live?

333
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:16,949
Just gave them a wall. I hate, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I can't

334
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,869
believe it. God damn it, this level is

335
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:28,150
really fucking hard. Come on man, I had it right there too.

336
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:44,730
This shit was done. How did he not throw it?

337
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:52,730
Holy shit, this is insane. All right, get like the sweaty fucking hand

338
00:49:52,730 --> 00:50:04,360
syndrome out of here. Light my fucking hand, I'm like

339
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:19,989
covered in water. 13 bullets. Okay, good. I think I did it.

340
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:25,219
Okay, just, I'm gonna keep the pistol. Just be very careful here.

341
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,860
There's no reason to freak out. I'm gonna wait till they turn around. There's

342
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,719
only three guys left. Four. That guy doesn't have a gun.

343
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:37,460
Nine bullets. That was a monster energy spread.

344
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,579
I don't even know what that means, but I guess I'll agree with you. There he

345
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:51,400
is, right here. One, two, three. Where's the

346
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,110
patrol? They're up there. That's a monster

347
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:03,400
energy. Stop distracting me. Oh my lord, I almost lost it right

348
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,719
there. I almost just lost it and I thought I didn't, I didn't. I just

349
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:12,789
barely got it. Oh man, okay. Anybody else have a gun? These two

350
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:21,380
guys don't have guns. Only one guy has a gun in there, but

351
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:36,730
he does have one. No, two guys with guns. Got me the

352
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,789
gun here. Okay, let's go for it. Nobody up or down,

353
00:51:40,789 --> 00:52:01,590
right? No one's gonna like snipe me. Oh, give me your gun. Oh,

354
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,510
just go? What do you mean just go? Stay in here and you'll be safe. I'm

355
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,309
gonna go see what's going on. Don't open the door until I get back

356
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:15,219
no matter what. Just go. That's easier said than

357
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:21,110
oh, the fucking window. I didn't even know there was a window here.

358
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:27,019
Well, I didn't know those things. How did I not shoot the guy with the gun?

359
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:45,960
What's this guy? Why is Death Eater here? What's no, Reaper?

360
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,329
Why is Reaper from Overwatch? Death Eater?

361
00:52:52,329 --> 00:53:02,170
Whatever his name is. Reaper. I am terrified to go over here. This

362
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:17,619
only has one bullet. Alright, where's Reaper? There he is.

363
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:23,190
Oh, fuck you. Oh my god, is he dead? He's dead, right?

364
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,869
Is he? He's not dead. Is he dead now? He's not dead now.

365
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:51,539
The head off. Okay, got it. I can't take his guns? Oh, oh, wait a minute!

366
00:53:51,539 --> 00:54:05,579
Oh, no! Oh, fuck. No, god damn it. Damn it.

367
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:17,690
And I have to fight Reaper again. I think that's the only way you can

368
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:25,449
kill him. You have to like rip his head off.

369
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,059
Alright, this time I'm not gonna just run over there. There's

370
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,500
one, two. Anybody down there? I think there is. I can't see that far.

371
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:43,880
There's a guy right there with a gun. Oh, no. Is he running up here?

372
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:59,880
I don't know which way he's gonna go. I'm hiding. I don't have any guns. I

373
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,559
don't have any guns. Guns, guns. Give me a gun.

374
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:13,179
Like, pull him into the bathroom? He has a shotgun, but I gotta get into

375
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,900
this room, I think. Is there anybody else in that room?

376
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:25,510
No, there's not. It's, it's, it's of these windows.

377
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:41,739
Oh, my goodness. Why can I not go over there?

378
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:45,500
What kind of aim do you have? What kind of aim do you have?

379
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,340
What kind of aim? What's that? You shot,

380
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,780
I locked onto him and he shot to the left and he shot to the right of him.

381
00:55:52,780 --> 00:56:02,150
What is the aim that I, what kind of aim is that?

382
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:25,960
Oh, fuck. This is bad. Maybe not. No, I need, give me the gun.

383
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:33,179
Fuck you. What do I do about Reaper? I can't believe it.

384
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,340
I had it too and it was done and I did, I just didn't get it done.

385
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:44,340
Because that, the bullshit shitty aim thing.

386
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:52,360
All right, get over here, Reaper. Come on.

387
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,130
Why is it always holy? What do you mean holy?

388
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,690
Like, there's nobody else over here. We're gonna shoot Reaper, break his

389
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:04,010
neck. Sorry, my throat.

390
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:12,170
I wish I could take his guns. Honest to god. Okay.

391
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:21,639
Do it again. Maybe I should just go that way.

392
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:29,179
What is that way? I can't believe it didn't hit.

393
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:36,860
Actually, no, no, no. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Oh god,

394
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,059
Jeremy. How did, I got stuck in the wall.

395
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:54,440
Who the fuck is that guy? Okay. Yeah, I needed

396
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,559
two shots to kill like the, whatever that guy was.

397
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:06,599
You stupid game. No fucking way. No way. No way. There's no way.

398
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:22,900
I don't believe it. I don't even believe it was possible.

399
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,789
That's impossible. Yes, I'm doing the movie villain thing at the end of the

400
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:31,829
movie, but it really is. I understand the villain now. I

401
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:38,519
know what he's saying. How it's not possible.

402
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,559
Damn it. Why did that have to happen? He just like

403
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,659
instantly fucking 180 pixel turned on me.

404
00:58:48,659 --> 00:59:00,469
Give me a break. I got stuck on the fucking wall.

405
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:39,750
I wish it would prioritize guns that have ammo in them.

406
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:57,429
How do I check that box? Get in this room.

407
00:59:57,429 --> 01:00:01,989
Room to room. Guy over there. They both have guns. I have four shots.

408
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:12,650
Did I get them both? I did not get them both.

409
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:26,820
Okay, now. I didn't. My brain wasn't prepared for a guy to come around the

410
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:32,250
corner like that. Oh my god. Why?

411
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:53,619
It was over. It was fucking over. It was done. And this guy right here.

412
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:57,849
You don't even have to know. I won't get to walk across the whole map. Did I hear a gunfire?

413
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:01,849
Have I heard gunfire the entire game? The whole floor?

414
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:06,170
Now I'll go out on this 600th shot this time. I think I heard something.

415
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:28,900
I broke the mic. I'm gonna get it this time. I'm gonna be prepared for

416
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:40,650
guy on the left. Got them both. I did. Okay.

417
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:47,000
Wait a minute. Wait. No, he's not here.

418
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,420
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I only have two bullets though. I need a

419
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,440
different gun. Does any- I only have- I gotta get

420
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:03,269
the guns that these guys dropped. Okay. I turn to like Vince McMahon sometimes.

421
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:11,769
Like I'm casting a wrestling event. Anybody hear that?

422
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:20,500
Did anybody hear that? Is what I need to know. I only have two bullets.

423
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:32,539
I have to make a count. Pick up the gun before I do something

424
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:37,340
where I scream. Okay. I think I got it.

425
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:42,150
There's that one last guy. I'm not fucking around. I'm gonna go all the

426
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,909
way around because he can shoot me through the glass.

427
01:02:43,909 --> 01:02:49,750
Because there is glass down here. Don't shoot me through the glass. I want to

428
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:59,780
shoot you through the glass. Okay. Get the keys. I can't go in

429
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:30,440
here? Who has the key? Oh, Reaper does.

430
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:39,829
I'm not your fucking girlfriend. Wait. What happened? I have to-

431
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:43,110
Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. What? What?

432
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:48,599
What? Okay. I was about to freaking freak out.

433
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:53,139
Cut. No need for a retake. That was perfect. This is a movie.

434
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:55,780
Good job, guys. Spectacular performances. So this is the movie that

435
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:02,579
the guy was talking about. I only got a few more shots to shoot

436
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:06,099
before we can move on to editing. Why don't you go grab something to eat

437
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:11,019
while we put in the new set piece. Make sure you're back in 30 minutes, okay?

438
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:15,619
Time is money. You heard him, Martin. Time to get up,

439
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:26,260
Martin. You spent all that time in rage on a movie.

440
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:32,969
71,000 is the total. That's a pretty good score so far.

441
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:38,340
I got a better than an A. I got 110 points. I got extra credit.

442
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,699
I remembered what the teacher's favorite candy was because that was the

443
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,920
extra credit question. Good thing I got it. I would have had a

444
01:04:46,920 --> 01:05:03,750
probably a C-. Second act rising. 1991 Miami, Florida.

445
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,789
Ah, the defendant claims that he was ordered to commit these murders through

446
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:12,900
messages left on his answering machine. Did you investigate these claims? Yes,

447
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,230
we did. And what did you find? Well, the

448
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:20,230
defendant's answering machine was empty. The tape had been removed.

449
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:24,360
Did you find anything supporting these claims of threatening phone calls?

450
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,840
No, sir, we did not. I see. No further questions.

451
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,039
You say you found no physical evidence supporting my client's claims. Then

452
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:36,440
what about phone records? Surely the police would have

453
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,820
no difficulty accessing such information. Indeed, we didn't investigate

454
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,739
the defendant's phone records. And did you find any calls on record that

455
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:53,260
could support my client's claims? We did, sir. The defendant seems

456
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:59,960
to have received phone calls that match the time frame which he

457
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,250
suggests. But did you manage to trace these calls? If so,

458
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,219
where did they come from? We traced the calls to a nightclub

459
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:14,889
called the Golden Truck Stop. Yes, now my client claims that he was

460
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:18,409
coerced by the Russian mafia to commit the crimes for which he was

461
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:21,369
now being prosecuted. Do the police have any knowledge of

462
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:24,570
ties between the Golden Truck Stop and the Russian mafia that could

463
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,730
support my client's claims? The venue has been linked to several

464
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:32,309
mob related crimes in the past. Yes, however, that would be all. Thank

465
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:37,269
you. No further questions. The witness may step down. The court will

466
01:06:37,269 --> 01:06:41,000
now be adjourned. Proceedings will continue tomorrow at 11am.

467
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,940
Meanwhile, the defendant will remain in police custody. Who's

468
01:06:44,940 --> 01:07:00,420
that? I think that's supposed to be me. Food in the trash? No. Time

469
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,440
to make a phone call. Leave a message on somebody's machine.

470
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,079
You've reached the Miami Police Department. How may I help you?

471
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:11,590
I'd like to talk to Detective Pardo. Tell him it's from Evan.

472
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:14,840
One moment, please. Click. What do you want, Evan? I'm in the

473
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,369
middle of something here. Hi, Manny. I'm at the courthouse doing

474
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:23,420
research on that masked maniac. What's that got to do with me?

475
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,409
Well, they mentioned the Golden Truck Stop. Something about mob

476
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,219
connections. So, I was wondering if you know anyone that I can

477
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:33,260
talk to. That's privilege information. You know I can't

478
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,400
talk about things like that. Look, I'm really busy here.

479
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:43,929
1-800-HIGH-SCHOOL-MUSICLE. Don't be like that now. You owe

480
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:48,949
me one, remember? Fine. Go to Northwest 37th Avenue. Ask

481
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:52,250
for Petrov and tell him I sent you. Can't promise he'll

482
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,570
talk, but it's the only name I've got. Don't call me at

483
01:07:54,570 --> 01:08:09,820
work again, okay? No more favors. Okay. Why is this just

484
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,559
the courtroom from Chrono Trigger? When you get tried?

485
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:33,369
These are the same models. All right, let's go. Okay. Why is

486
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:40,619
everybody holding a boombox? Are these the guys playing the

487
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:53,640
music? Is it a protest or something? All right. Cameras.

488
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:04,069
Fifth scene. First trial. Here we and here we go. The

489
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,869
Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The

490
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:14,920
Joker. Oh my god. Did he just make a Joker reference? I'm

491
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,579
here to see Petrov. Tell him Detective Pardo sent me.

492
01:09:18,579 --> 01:09:22,390
No, I don't think so. If you don't have an invitation,

493
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:31,500
you better leave. Okay. What the fuck was that? Am I

494
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,220
bringing him back to life? Hold on. I killed him and now

495
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,260
I'm bringing him back to life.

496
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:45,239
What? What the fuck was that, Jeremy? It was the

497
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:48,649
fucking Joker. Help. Somebody call an ambulance. There's

498
01:09:48,649 --> 01:10:02,390
been an accident. Is there anyone here? Oh, pick up

499
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,470
the gun. What are you doing? Why can I not pick the

500
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:19,300
gun up? What? Am I like non-violent? Oh shit. Okay. I

501
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:32,260
gotta go. Oh, you idiot. You idiot. Idiot.

502
01:10:44,489 --> 01:11:00,869
What about the guys with the guns? Oh, you idiot. I get

503
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:02,869
it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Okay. I get it. I'm

504
01:11:02,869 --> 01:11:04,789
disarming the guns. I get it. I understand it now. So

505
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:22,949
they can't use them. I get it. What's that guy with

506
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:42,810
the fucking gun right there? Oh, you idiot. Oh shit.

507
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:50,260
He got up. Oh fuck. Okay. Get it. Go get the gun.

508
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:20,899
And excuse me, all of you watching at home. I'd like to

509
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:24,819
know what killed me behind the corner. I'd like to

510
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:32,359
have an explanation as to who did it. Oh, that

511
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:41,289
guy. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the explanation. Okay.

512
01:12:41,289 --> 01:12:42,729
That's actually pretty good. I'd rather go.

513
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:55,319
Does this guy fight? Is the guy gonna attack me?

514
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:57,239
Okay. So after they get knocked down, they don't

515
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:06,329
care anymore. Is that what I'm understanding? All

516
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:11,609
right. Okay. And if I, I clearly very clearly like

517
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:14,890
I punched him. I did. I punching him. He's being

518
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:39,319
punched. That's all I wanted. Fuck. Oh my God.

519
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:47,979
Oh my God. Now that they all see me. Okay. Is

520
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:53,340
there anybody? I can't tell. I need to get that

521
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:59,800
gun. I need that back. I need that fucking thing

522
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:09,659
back. Nobody else, right? Nobody else. Nobody

523
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:16,500
else. Oh, I didn't do it right. I didn't do it

524
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:25,270
right. I didn't do it right. I didn't do it

525
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,270
right. You can knock them out with space bar.

526
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,130
What are you talking about? Isn't that what

527
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:43,159
I'm doing? Okay. So that's why I didn't do it

528
01:14:43,159 --> 01:15:08,600
because it takes fucking forever to do that. I'd

529
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,399
love to know what world that was. What fucking

530
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:12,840
world are we living in when that doesn't kill

531
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,970
them? Okay. Put this down here. Disarm. Disarm it.

532
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,130
I can't disarm that. Okay. Well, I don't even need

533
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,310
to. All right. I'm gonna get this motherfucker

534
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:45,770
right now. And I threw the fucking thing. I just

535
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,810
want to put it down. I just wanted to place it

536
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,689
below me. I didn't have to throw it. I just

537
01:15:51,689 --> 01:16:06,069
whipped it across the game. I'm gonna go

538
01:16:06,069 --> 01:16:22,649
around. Too long. Too long. Too long. That

539
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:25,689
takes too long. Okay. I got it. Don't fuck

540
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:36,409
this up. It's an easy throw. Okay. I'm good.

541
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:45,100
Now the knife. Holy shit. I didn't even see

542
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:51,529
him. Guy with a gun. Anybody else around

543
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:53,369
the corner? I'm fucking paranoid. Hold on. Let

544
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:57,979
me go this way. I don't know. Is there a guy

545
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:01,000
with a gun up here? No, there's not. Okay.

546
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,399
Wrap around. I just want to see. There is

547
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:04,680
a kid. There's more. There are more people

548
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,970
up here. I'm gonna go the other way.

549
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:17,289
Because I gotta throw it at this guy. I got

550
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:18,489
it. I got it. But the other guys have

551
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:21,699
guns too. What? What about? What do I do

552
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:23,859
about that? I think I have to go the other

553
01:17:23,859 --> 01:17:33,260
way. Ugh. No, I don't. Here he comes. Oh,

554
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,460
fuck. Anything else? Okay. I disarmed the

555
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,710
gun. Just two guys with melee and a guy

556
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:45,819
with a gun. Just wait till he stand up.

557
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:47,500
I'm not taking the- I'm not taking the

558
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,750
time to do the animation. How far up is

559
01:17:51,750 --> 01:18:00,069
he? All the way up, right? It's good,

560
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:01,590
right? He's done. Spacebar's not doing

561
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,350
anything. One guy left. I have to sneak

562
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,310
up behind him and throw this in the

563
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:09,180
back of his head. Holy fuck, he

564
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:12,789
turned around really quickly. Okay.

565
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:18,619
Thank god. There's more of this shit.

566
01:18:18,619 --> 01:18:30,899
There's more of this shit. I can't hit

567
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:33,130
him through the window. All right.

568
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:40,520
Disarm. Who's left? Two more guys. Oh,

569
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,880
fuck. Not through the window. Not through

570
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,600
the window. Don't get me through the

571
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:51,210
window. Disarm their guns. This is too-

572
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,090
No, that guy can see me through the

573
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:57,270
window. Oh, Kenny? Is anybody below? If

574
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,630
I go over there, I- you know what I'm

575
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:02,569
saying? If I do this, he can see me

576
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:07,340
through the fucking window.

577
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:17,880
Oh, fuck. Dude, do it. Do it. Get off

578
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,960
of him. How do I get off this guy?

579
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,079
How do I get off this guy? Oh, okay.

580
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:24,279
I got it. I'm good.

581
01:19:24,279 --> 01:19:43,880
Okay. This game's- this game is so

582
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,880
stressful. It's too- how am I gonna

583
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:53,140
get into this guy? I have to throw

584
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:57,670
it at him. I have to throw it at him.

585
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:04,579
Oh, my bike. I just like-

586
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:14,779
Okay, I did it, right? What's left?

587
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:19,800
Somebody down here?

588
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:26,010
Are there windows down here? Okay, no

589
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,409
windows, but I gotta make this good.

590
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:34,380
Oh, should I not be killing?

591
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,859
I just threw him in the fucking bathtub.

592
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:38,699
I need those.

593
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:52,920
Who's this? Who the hell are you?

594
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,680
Oh, hey. There's a cutscene going on

595
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,600
here. Ah, I-

596
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,640
Do I not- um, are you Petrov?

597
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,119
I'm writing a book about the mask maniac.

598
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:04,840
Detective Pardo told me I could talk to

599
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,300
you about it. Detective Pardo told you

600
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,699
that. A friend of yours.

601
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:14,090
That's right, sir. Not a very good

602
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,930
friend. I take it I'm ready.

603
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,369
Son sending you here all of all

604
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:19,300
places. You know, I reckon you're

605
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,979
right about that, sir. Okay, give me

606
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,340
control back and I'm gonna get it.

607
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,939
Guy in the- hold on, I gotta look at it again.

608
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:24,979
This book you're writing must be very

609
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:26,659
important. Risking your life to come

610
01:21:26,659 --> 01:21:27,859
talk to me. Sure, you've got- you've got

611
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:29,859
balls. What is it you want to know?

612
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,859
You get two questions. Then you get the

613
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,060
fuck out of here.

614
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,609
Okay, I have to turn around. I gotta-

615
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:39,270
ANS. Hold ANS. Swing around. Swing.

616
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,630
All right, the police claims the

617
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,229
Masked Ritterers were part of a

618
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:45,029
vigilante movement. Are you of the

619
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:48,149
same opinion?

620
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:50,420
No. I don't think they were

621
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,859
vigilantes. They were much too

622
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:53,060
organized.

623
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,979
They knew our exact locations and had

624
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:56,899
insight into our inner workings.

625
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:58,180
I don't know what they were a part

626
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,859
of, but it was a group. No group of

627
01:21:59,859 --> 01:22:01,460
vigilantes.

628
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:02,659
Why do you think they targeted the

629
01:22:02,659 --> 01:22:03,779
Russian mafia?

630
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:05,779
What were they after? I can't tell you

631
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:07,539
what they were after, but

632
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,220
they effectively destroyed our whole

633
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,859
organization and then they were gone.

634
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:12,979
They knew what they were doing and

635
01:22:12,979 --> 01:22:15,510
they seemed to be trained very well.

636
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,869
We caught a couple of them alive,

637
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:18,859
tried to break them. None of them

638
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:20,380
talked, not a single one.

639
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,420
All right, no more questions. Get the

640
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,619
hell out of my sight. Here we go.

641
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:37,270
Okay. What do I do about this? Okay,

642
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,600
we're fine.

643
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:53,369
Okay, we're good. Bad end. Bad end.

644
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:58,649
Why is it the bad end? What do you

645
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,250
mean bad end?

646
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:08,229
Actual maniac. You killed someone.

647
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:10,789
I accidentally, because I was panic

648
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:20,630
pressing the button.

649
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:25,420
Don't listen to them. Don't listen to

650
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,380
chat.

651
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:33,380
Well, that's all right. That's a D+.

652
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:41,369
That's the first time I've had a D+.

653
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:44,569
I've only had Cs in the first game.

654
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:47,369
And Bs and As. Still passing grade. I'm

655
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:48,550
okay.

656
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:52,300
What a day. Did something happen?

657
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,100
No, well, yeah. That guy Petrov, he

658
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,060
wouldn't see me.

659
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,579
Almost got beaten up just trying to get

660
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:01,130
in. Hey, you actually

661
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:03,369
went there. Didn't figure you would. Man,

662
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:04,729
sometimes I wonder why I hang out with

663
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:05,449
you.

664
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:08,170
When did you become such a douchebag?

665
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:09,689
Well, I did tell you to write about

666
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:10,970
the Miami

667
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:13,930
mutilator instead, didn't I? A much more

668
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,369
sophisticated case.

669
01:24:15,369 --> 01:24:16,409
Really, and you wouldn't have to

670
01:24:16,409 --> 01:24:17,529
talk to them all.

671
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:18,970
People will have forgotten about those

672
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,409
vigilantes by the time your book's

673
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:21,289
out.

674
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,310
I accidentally stomped a guy's head to

675
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,909
the wall and blasted his brother's

676
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:27,189
torso with a shotgun.

677
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,159
Come on. Besides, I bought you a beer,

678
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:36,439
right? And you didn't really get hurt,

679
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:37,079
did you?

680
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:39,800
Let's call it even. Thanks for the

681
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,600
beer and all, but you still owe me one.

682
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
All right, all right. Don't forget I'm

683
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,119
putting my job on the line.

684
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:47,560
If anyone finds out I'm giving you

685
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,319
leads, that'll be it for me.

686
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:53,689
You'll be fired for incompetence or

687
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,130
misconduct before that happens. I'm

688
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,170
surprised they haven't fired you

689
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,210
already.

690
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,609
I'm tired, let's get out of here. Yeah,

691
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:00,970
I should get some sleep too. You want

692
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,680
a ride?

693
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:09,720
I'll take my chances on the bus. Wait,

694
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,149
who the fuck am I? Okay, I'm the

695
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,430
different character now.

696
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:25,340
All right, did you just try to kill him? I

697
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,779
was not trying to kill him. I just pressed

698
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:27,819
space on him

699
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:29,100
to see if there's extra dialogue

700
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,689
sequences. September 2nd, 1991.

701
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:35,369
So we're going somewhere special

702
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:36,649
tonight, eh?

703
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:39,159
Yeah, my friend Jack told me he built

704
01:25:39,159 --> 01:25:41,399
this place down on Northwest AA 184th

705
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:41,880
Street.

706
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,720
A real shithole. The whole building is

707
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,800
occupied by junkies and lowlifes.

708
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,720
Kind of like this place, huh?

709
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,359
Uh, fuck you, Mark. Anyway, his

710
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:51,720
sister's been hanging out with these

711
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,079
assholes. Hasn't been

712
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:54,680
home for weeks. He figured we'd get

713
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,720
her home

714
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,760
and teach her friends a lesson. Wait,

715
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:59,800
we're doing house calls for your

716
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,020
friends now?

717
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,300
Isn't that pretty much what we did

718
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,140
last time? I didn't hear any

719
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,659
complaints back then.

720
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:07,020
We can't patrol the streets looking

721
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,220
for scumbags.

722
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,470
We'd be in jail in no time. Yeah,

723
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,890
but I didn't sign up to be no hero

724
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,649
rescuing women and shit. That's just

725
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,010
not my thing. I just want some

726
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,130
action. So you got any better ideas or

727
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,489
should we just stay here and argue

728
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:21,130
all night?

729
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,029
I sure as hell ain't staying here. I'm

730
01:26:23,029 --> 01:26:24,550
ready to roll. Am I gonna get the

731
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,300
the quack mask?

732
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,359
Fine, I'll come along. But if anything

733
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:29,399
happens to the girl, it's not my

734
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:31,289
problem. Got it.

735
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:34,010
Sure. Okay. Well, whatever. Let's go.

736
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:47,239
Slot machine? Nice. What is this fucked

737
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:47,880
up like?

738
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:55,640
Ghostbusters mobile. Moving up.

739
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,659
Okay, roll dodge. Killing punches. No

740
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:02,140
weapons. What is roll dodge?

741
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:11,260
When did I have this? What the fuck?

742
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,149
I guess I just didn't even know I

743
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:15,270
had this.

744
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:23,260
Rewind. Killing punches. I like this.

745
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:36,739
Look glee. All right.

746
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:38,659
Nice and easy. Left. Right. Look both

747
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,500
ways before you cross the street.

748
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:43,510
It's easy enough. I can't even pick up

749
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:44,390
weapons.

750
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:48,649
Okay, we got gun guys gotta go first.

751
01:27:48,649 --> 01:28:00,380
It was pretty sloppy, but whatever. Guy

752
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,979
with a gun. He's gotta go first or I

753
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:03,100
can bait the guy with the knife.

754
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:07,739
Wowee. That was fucking close. Okay.

755
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:09,819
Lots of guys with guns. Might have to

756
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:18,550
actually go the other way.

757
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:19,430
Yeah, let's take these guys out

758
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:27,300
first. Another door opening down here.

759
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,529
Okay, that's it.

760
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:31,770
All right, I can go through there.

761
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,579
There's a hole in the wall, but

762
01:28:33,579 --> 01:28:36,279
there's also a guy with a gun.

763
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:46,890
So it's all about the bait. I could go

764
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,449
down.

765
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:48,729
I don't really want anyone to shoot in

766
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:49,930
the middle here. That'll alert

767
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,130
everybody.

768
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,119
I'm thinking, I'm thinking straight

769
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:55,479
through try to kill both of them in one

770
01:28:55,479 --> 01:29:04,060
punch.

771
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:10,739
Or eight. That's fine. I see windows.

772
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:13,579
No, I'm good.

773
01:29:13,579 --> 01:29:15,100
One guy. That guy almost blended in

774
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,869
with the ground.

775
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:20,470
I almost just ran in here and

776
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:27,130
screamed. All right. So far so good.

777
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,090
This guy. I don't think, I don't think

778
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,609
this guy has a gun.

779
01:29:29,609 --> 01:29:32,149
It's just the two guys up there and

780
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:33,989
then one guy. No, that's it, right?

781
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:35,109
Okay, here we go. I'm just gonna

782
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:37,619
ambush.

783
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:46,500
Not yet. No. Anything in the toilet or

784
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,539
anything? Nothing over here? I can't

785
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:49,500
really go anywhere from here.

786
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,779
All right, ambush this guy. Don't look

787
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:51,579
at me. Don't look at me. Don't look

788
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:52,619
at me.

789
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:54,460
Holy shit. That was almost very bad.

790
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,729
Okay, only got two guys left.

791
01:29:56,729 --> 01:29:58,409
Three, actually. That's a mistake to

792
01:29:58,409 --> 01:30:07,029
call it two.

793
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:13,210
No, no, no. Go back around.

794
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:15,500
This has been so clean. I haven't

795
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,819
died once. I'm not gonna ruin this.

796
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:20,500
I'm gonna go back around down

797
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:26,119
here.

798
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:27,399
You actually can't pick up any

799
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:33,909
weapons. All right, here we go.

800
01:30:33,989 --> 01:30:47,079
Once this guy moves. Oh no, I...

801
01:30:47,079 --> 01:31:04,329
fuck. Where am I standing? Okay.

802
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:07,289
Almost a disaster. Almost a fucking

803
01:31:07,289 --> 01:31:09,050
complete disaster.

804
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:14,920
That's it, right? Only one more. Only

805
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,560
one guy left down here in this room.

806
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:24,840
Clean. As clean as it can be.

807
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:37,189
Dogs. Does me punt... Can I punch the

808
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:38,710
dog once and kill it?

809
01:31:46,069 --> 01:31:57,739
Damn it. Okay. There's another guy with a

810
01:31:57,739 --> 01:32:03,449
gun down there, I thought.

811
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:09,140
Is there? Oh, fuck. There was. Geez.

812
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:12,420
Geez. Geez, and a dog. Geez.

813
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,539
They're fast, right? They're very

814
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:15,289
fast.

815
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:17,369
I knew it was fast. I knew it was

816
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:18,569
fast too, and I just

817
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:20,890
wasn't ready for it. My muscle brain

818
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,649
to computer memory.

819
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:35,050
Where's the other guy? I know you're

820
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:39,239
down there, you little asshole.

821
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:49,000
Okay, dog. Get ready for it. You gotta,

822
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,699
you gotta be the aggressor.

823
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:57,210
Right, you know what I mean? None of these guys have guns.

824
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:01,050
This should be fairly simple. Holy shit.

825
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:04,149
He had a gun. I thought that cigarette

826
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:10,010
was a knife.

827
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:11,210
What happened? Holy fuck. Why would

828
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,970
they do the animation like that?

829
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:35,770
I can't... How am I gonna do that room?

830
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:36,649
I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna

831
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:40,899
do this room.

832
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:42,819
Holy shit in my pants and my fucking

833
01:33:42,819 --> 01:33:55,130
face.

834
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,050
Get over here, man. Oh, well, I'm

835
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:58,489
thinning him out.

836
01:33:58,489 --> 01:34:00,069
I'm gonna try to go around and see

837
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:01,829
if there's a better opportunity.

838
01:34:01,829 --> 01:34:08,739
Doesn't look like there is.

839
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:16,409
Is there somebody down here? Somebody

840
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:18,260
with a gun?

841
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:24,779
Yep. Yep. Wowee.

842
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:30,060
How am I supposed to get in this room?

843
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:36,340
With just, with one punch man?

844
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,699
I have to go in that room on the

845
01:34:37,699 --> 01:34:41,350
right, don't I?

846
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:46,340
Or I have to pull them out. Holy

847
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,380
shit.

848
01:34:47,380 --> 01:35:01,720
I'm so disappointed. I just, I went

849
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,760
all the way back in my chair and

850
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,119
wrapped my head.

851
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:22,329
Christ. Oh my god.

852
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:38,920
Fuck. Damn it. Focusing on the dog.

853
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,060
Jesus Christ. Dog.

854
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:50,060
Like, how did I get this guy last time?

855
01:35:50,060 --> 01:36:03,750
I debated him and he...

856
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,869
Fuck.

857
01:36:06,869 --> 01:36:08,949
I just, I felt those bullets.

858
01:36:08,949 --> 01:36:10,550
They missed my character and hit

859
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:13,640
me.

860
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,960
Come on. Why? I'm not, I'm just

861
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,239
clicking on the dog.

862
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:34,180
I'm not hitting space on him. Jesus.

863
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,100
This level is fucking brutal.

864
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:41,689
I just almost missed him. Okay, back

865
01:36:41,689 --> 01:36:43,289
to where I was before.

866
01:36:43,289 --> 01:36:49,079
I'm getting like, caught on my keyboard.

867
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:56,939
I forgot about the dog, but it's okay.

868
01:36:56,939 --> 01:36:59,420
I got it.

869
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,819
All right, can I... Here's the question.

870
01:37:01,819 --> 01:37:02,859
All right, I'm going for it. Go, go, go,

871
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:09,159
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

872
01:37:09,159 --> 01:37:11,899
All right. Now I have to bait him over

873
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:15,399
here.

874
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:18,680
Who has a gun? These two have guns.

875
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:25,739
Was it all three of them? I got all

876
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,470
three of them.

877
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:30,470
Just this guy up here. Okay, slow

878
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:36,180
down. I'm gonna get shot in the

879
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:45,880
fucking head.

880
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:49,819
Wowee. That was fucking rough.

881
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:55,130
That was rough. I say wowee a lot. I

882
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:55,930
know.

883
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:58,140
Stay back.

884
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,420
Whoa, take it easy. I'm just here to

885
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,939
get you. Your brother sent us. We're

886
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:02,659
not going to harm you.

887
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:04,659
My brother? You just killed all my

888
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:05,619
friends.

889
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:08,060
Look, we've got a car waiting outside,

890
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,979
so drop the gun. It's time to go.

891
01:38:09,979 --> 01:38:11,819
We'll drop you off at your brother's.

892
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:13,609
You accepted to go with you? Are you

893
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:14,489
insane?

894
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:15,930
You murdered my friends. You're not

895
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,130
taking me anywhere.

896
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,960
Now leave me the fuck alone.

897
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,399
Fine, you have it your way. We're out

898
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:22,039
of here.

899
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:32,119
What was that? Okay. Don't do it. Don't do

900
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:32,920
what?

901
01:38:32,920 --> 01:39:16,329
I'm back. All right, so that's not

902
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:20,630
part of a cutscene thing.

903
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:22,470
That actually just did happen.

904
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:30,180
Okay.

905
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:33,399
I'm...

906
01:39:33,399 --> 01:39:37,399
Don't do it. Don't do it.

907
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:41,619
Don't fucking do it. How did you...

908
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:43,140
All right, I'll take that as a sign

909
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,109
that I...

910
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:46,789
I fucking found a new way to do

911
01:39:46,789 --> 01:40:02,170
this. Dog...

912
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:04,649
Ah, come on. Come on. I beat it. I

913
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:06,970
beat it. The fucking girl had to shoot

914
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,409
me. Don't do it, Jeremy.

915
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:40,899
Oh, Jeremy. God. Oh, I'm standing. I'm

916
01:40:40,899 --> 01:40:42,659
standing up right now. I can't... I did

917
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:43,380
this.

918
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,380
I already beat this mission, and I

919
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,060
beat it very well, too.

920
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:50,420
I took my fucking time. Oh, man.

921
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,859
I need to turn on like a fucking...

922
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:53,140
something in my ear. I need like a

923
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,579
Secret Service person to be like,

924
01:40:54,579 --> 01:40:56,420
don't touch the girl.

925
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:03,819
I need someone to feed me lines

926
01:41:03,819 --> 01:41:05,100
through. A fucking earpiece.

927
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:09,659
Oh, my god. I'm so salty right now.

928
01:41:09,659 --> 01:41:11,180
That's the perfect word to describe

929
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,939
how I feel right now. It's just like,

930
01:41:12,939 --> 01:41:13,579
just a...

931
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:18,060
Oh, man. Oh, man. Man.

932
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:27,220
I... I already did it.

933
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,180
I... I'm... I'm full fucking... Shake the

934
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,380
fucking pinball machine, man.

935
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,739
Seriously.

936
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:34,500
Just shake it up and spray it all

937
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:43,239
over the fucking ground.

938
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:45,800
I'm gonna take my time. Fucking come

939
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,930
on.

940
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:56,220
No. The only way to play this game is

941
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:00,039
go fast and lose fast. No, I...

942
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:05,529
Not me. I play this game with fucking

943
01:42:05,529 --> 01:42:06,970
patience.

944
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,970
I'm trying to time my hits and shots

945
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:09,930
and getting

946
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:14,010
things where I want them. Okay, now I

947
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,130
can go over here.

948
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,810
Open this door. Bait him through the

949
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:20,659
door.

950
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:23,960
Not... Won't be long now. How did this

951
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,399
guy not see me? Dog! Get the dog

952
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:26,359
first!

953
01:42:26,359 --> 01:42:46,779
Ah, fuck! Okay, whatever. What the fuck is this guy?

954
01:42:46,779 --> 01:42:50,010
Why is he... He's right there with a gun and I

955
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:54,409
can't...

956
01:42:54,409 --> 01:43:12,100
Fuck. You get... Where's the last guy?

957
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,380
Over here, right? Yeah, there's a

958
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,819
couple, right? Oh my god, I remember

959
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:16,420
this part. I remember being so scared

960
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,619
here.

961
01:43:17,619 --> 01:43:18,899
I remember this part. I'm being

962
01:43:18,899 --> 01:43:21,880
terrified. Is there no other way to

963
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,840
go? All right, there's

964
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,199
one guy with a Uzi and I can't get

965
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:27,479
there any other way. I have to bait

966
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:28,279
him.

967
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:38,460
Will he see me from here? I don't

968
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,420
have to run up there,

969
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:44,300
but I can't see.

970
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:47,109
Okay, just go! Done! Just fucking get out

971
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:48,630
of here. Get the hell out of here.

972
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:50,630
I'm not touching the girl. I'm not...

973
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:51,750
I'm not gonna...

974
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,149
Go, let go! Punch! Punch! No, no!

975
01:43:54,149 --> 01:43:55,829
Why would I ever stay back? Yes, hold

976
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:57,590
right mouse button to skip.

977
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,270
Go, bye! Thank you for playing. I'll

978
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:00,229
see you later.

979
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:18,819
Get the fuck out of here. I forget

980
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:20,899
where I'm going. Where am I going?

981
01:44:20,899 --> 01:44:24,859
Where's the car? Why did I park my

982
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:25,819
car?

983
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:34,859
All right, down here. Oh my god, thank

984
01:44:34,859 --> 01:44:41,289
goodness.

985
01:44:41,289 --> 01:44:42,569
I can't believe I had to do that

986
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:49,029
again.

987
01:44:49,029 --> 01:44:57,979
How is that a D plus? I... I...

988
01:44:57,979 --> 01:45:04,460
All right, I got Alex and Ash.

989
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:09,319
Didn't get any high combos. Damn it.

990
01:45:09,319 --> 01:45:10,840
Down anytime soon. It's not a good

991
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,119
time to be messing around if a cop

992
01:45:12,119 --> 01:45:14,279
came by. Sauce like this.

993
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:17,079
It ain't gonna go faster with you

994
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:18,920
bitching, okay? Besides, I've been

995
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,600
telling you to get the van fixed for

996
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,039
weeks.

997
01:45:22,039 --> 01:45:23,399
Right, I still don't see any of that

998
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:25,640
be my job. It's not my van.

999
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:28,119
Just fucking do it.

1000
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:30,359
The only one of us who ain't busy with

1001
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:31,640
work all day.

1002
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,720
Take it down to Andy and the chop shop.

1003
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,640
He owes me one.

1004
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,479
Fine, just get the car running and

1005
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:38,840
I'll do it tomorrow, okay?

1006
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:41,159
Yeah, that should do it. Try starting

1007
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:42,760
her up and let's see what the hell's

1008
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,760
had to happen in here.

1009
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:49,369
This is my Stardew Valley character

1010
01:45:49,369 --> 01:45:50,569
all over again.

1011
01:45:50,569 --> 01:46:05,140
Am I like a... am I like a billionaire

1012
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,100
apartment?

1013
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:09,109
What's the matter? You look a little

1014
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:12,069
nervous. Well, boss, something you need to

1015
01:46:12,069 --> 01:46:14,630
say, just say it. Look,

1016
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:16,069
we've known each other for a long time

1017
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,390
now. You've done a lot for me.

1018
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,500
No need to be polite, cut to the point.

1019
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,850
All right, I want out. I'm getting too

1020
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:27,319
old for this. I'm feeling too soft.

1021
01:46:27,319 --> 01:46:29,479
Too soft? Too soft for what?

1022
01:46:29,479 --> 01:46:30,840
Shooting people, putting my ass on

1023
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,439
the line. I've had a feeling I'm not

1024
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:33,720
going to last much longer for a

1025
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,520
while now.

1026
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,500
Been having these dreams. Dreams, huh?

1027
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,779
You want out? You're out.

1028
01:46:38,779 --> 01:46:40,380
But first, you have to take care of

1029
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:43,260
some business for me, okay?

1030
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,640
What business? Nothing big. A chop

1031
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,859
shop downtown.

1032
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:49,859
They're with the Colombians now. Won't

1033
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:51,899
give us our cut no more.

1034
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:54,140
Don't worry, they're just hoodlums.

1035
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:56,090
Nothing you can't handle.

1036
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:58,779
And then I'm out. Yes. Though you're

1037
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,140
free to come back anytime you change

1038
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:00,619
your mind.

1039
01:47:00,619 --> 01:47:02,279
As a parting gift, grab a sample of

1040
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:06,409
our new product here. Might spice up

1041
01:47:06,409 --> 01:47:08,010
this new boring lifestyle you've

1042
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,539
chosen.

1043
01:47:09,539 --> 01:47:11,220
Best voice acting ever? You want me

1044
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:14,020
to go for it? Fine. Here you go.

1045
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:18,390
Give me the next line. Give me the

1046
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:28,520
next voice line. Well, there's no

1047
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,479
more lines.

1048
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:38,979
I don't get to take the eagle car,

1049
01:47:38,979 --> 01:47:40,359
whatever it is.

1050
01:47:40,359 --> 01:48:03,140
No mercy. Okay. Damn it!

1051
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:11,619
I'm trying to go for- I'm trying to get

1052
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:14,310
combos.

1053
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:26,100
It's never gonna happen, okay? This

1054
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,140
game is so

1055
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:29,060
fucking fast-paced and so hard to

1056
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:31,140
lose. It's so easy to lose.

1057
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,340
Is there a skateboard on the ground?

1058
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:45,829
What can I do with this? Oh.

1059
01:48:45,829 --> 01:48:47,029
You know how you get combos in this

1060
01:48:47,029 --> 01:48:48,229
game? You have to beat the level

1061
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:50,149
like five times and like recognize

1062
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,750
exactly where to go every- that's

1063
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,869
where the combos come in.

1064
01:48:52,869 --> 01:48:54,550
You're gonna get a fucking D plus

1065
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:55,909
on every mission.

1066
01:48:55,909 --> 01:48:58,869
Or a B. It's gonna happen every time

1067
01:48:58,869 --> 01:49:00,470
until you can sprint through and know

1068
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:07,159
every kill and get like a 10 hit combo.

1069
01:49:07,159 --> 01:49:09,340
Really? What the fuck is that plywood

1070
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:16,260
on the ground blocking?

1071
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,739
Jesus god, give me a fucking break.

1072
01:49:18,739 --> 01:49:23,319
He's gonna shoot me through the

1073
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:24,439
fucking glass. Look at all the glass

1074
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:31,739
everywhere.

1075
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:47,640
Jesus Christ! Oh come on.

1076
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,659
Eat shit. That's enough time? That

1077
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:50,779
gives me- that gives me enough time to

1078
01:49:50,779 --> 01:50:10,939
do this?

1079
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:12,859
One guy over there. Is it that- is that

1080
01:50:12,859 --> 01:50:14,699
a bomb? What's this? Is that a bomb?

1081
01:50:14,699 --> 01:50:15,739
That looks like a wire that's

1082
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:17,180
connected to a bomb.

1083
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:34,729
Can you shoot through couches? Oh fucking

1084
01:50:34,729 --> 01:50:43,939
god. Jesus.

1085
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:54,329
Last guy. Two guys. Got it. Okay. Good.

1086
01:50:54,329 --> 01:50:58,550
Floor cleared. Let's move.

1087
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:10,260
Where's the next floor? Oh okay. So

1088
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,699
it's just at the edge of the level.

1089
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:17,689
You got it. All right, let's go.

1090
01:51:17,689 --> 01:51:19,050
Holy fuck! Where did you guys come

1091
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:27,779
from? Down here? Oh shit, you did.

1092
01:51:27,779 --> 01:51:28,819
Damn, I didn't know you could shoot

1093
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:41,510
over the car. I don't have enough

1094
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:42,390
bullets for this.

1095
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:47,270
I have enough of that and then I

1096
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:48,470
gotta wait because I don't have any bullets.

1097
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:49,829
So where the hell am I gonna go?

1098
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:53,770
This way. Let's go to the left.

1099
01:51:53,770 --> 01:52:03,239
There's a lot? Okay. And there's a

1100
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,159
where did the third fucking guy come

1101
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:06,840
from? Find him.

1102
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,960
Why was that guy here? What the heck?

1103
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,479
Restart it. No, don't restart it. Just

1104
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:14,229
die.

1105
01:52:14,229 --> 01:52:45,319
A third guy. Fucking glass.

1106
01:52:45,319 --> 01:52:57,449
Glass. All right, got it. Give me one

1107
01:52:57,449 --> 01:53:07,159
of your guns.

1108
01:53:07,159 --> 01:53:14,520
Glass him. Other side of the Pac-man

1109
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,039
level here we go.

1110
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,489
Ooh, that wasn't good. That wasn't

1111
01:53:18,489 --> 01:53:24,489
good either.

1112
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:31,579
That wasn't good either. Panic! Panic!

1113
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:51,140
Panic! Panic!

1114
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:53,130
What the fuck shot me through the

1115
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:59,659
glass?

1116
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:01,340
Okay, can I, let me just be real for a

1117
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,539
second.

1118
01:54:02,539 --> 01:54:03,819
Do you see where this motherfucker

1119
01:54:03,819 --> 01:54:06,229
shot me from? I was down here.

1120
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:08,069
This guy shot through the glass over

1121
01:54:08,069 --> 01:54:09,619
the car.

1122
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:11,779
Over the fucking disco machine.

1123
01:54:11,779 --> 01:54:12,979
The guy shot from across the whole

1124
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:38,899
level.

1125
01:54:38,899 --> 01:54:58,229
I didn't shoot the dog. Relax. Dog.

1126
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:59,590
Nobody up here. That's the guy that

1127
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:12,180
shot me through the glass last time.

1128
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:14,100
Glass? Anybody up there? Just check

1129
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:14,979
to make sure I'm not gonna get shot

1130
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:15,539
by somebody.

1131
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:30,020
It's a glass shooter. Money? Can I

1132
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:31,060
pick up the money?

1133
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:38,550
Last guy up there. Dog. Fuck.

1134
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:40,789
Good thing I saw that right when I did.

1135
01:55:40,789 --> 01:55:42,460
I'm just gonna wait for this guy.

1136
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:47,210
I don't care if I lose points. Who's

1137
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:48,090
left?

1138
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:58,069
Don't just fucking sprint through. It's

1139
01:55:58,069 --> 01:56:00,310
not safe until everybody's dead.

1140
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:03,100
Which I cannot guarantee I know where

1141
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,180
they are. Okay, he's right there.

1142
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:12,460
All right, good. Get the bag. The bag

1143
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,659
of money?

1144
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:16,199
Is that gonna be, is that a bomb? Is that a

1145
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:17,560
bomb on the car? Okay, get me out of

1146
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:30,340
here.

1147
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,020
There's a bomb on the car. It's gonna

1148
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:34,550
explode. I can't fuck around in

1149
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:35,510
levels anymore guys. I don't know

1150
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:36,550
which levels are gonna kill me or

1151
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:37,189
not.

1152
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:55,939
Well, who the hell are you? Thought you

1153
01:56:55,939 --> 01:56:57,539
could get away, huh?

1154
01:56:57,539 --> 01:57:01,560
Get away. I just work here. Who are you?

1155
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,920
You're freaking me out, man.

1156
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,569
It's your lucky day today, kid. This

1157
01:57:04,569 --> 01:57:06,090
bag here just saved your life.

1158
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:07,050
I'm getting out of here. You should

1159
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:08,539
probably do the same.

1160
01:57:08,539 --> 01:57:28,569
Now, out of my way! Voice acting.

1161
01:57:28,569 --> 01:57:30,810
Time bonus. Special. I'm not getting any

1162
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:36,069
of those bonuses.

1163
01:57:36,069 --> 01:57:38,949
That was a C. I feel like I did

1164
01:57:38,949 --> 01:57:43,260
that one pretty quickly.

1165
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,619
That one was, I felt like that one

1166
01:57:44,619 --> 01:57:45,979
was pretty good.

1167
01:57:45,979 --> 01:57:52,010
All right, here we are. Hi honey,

1168
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:52,729
welcome home.

1169
01:57:52,729 --> 01:57:54,729
I made you dinner. It's in the fridge.

1170
01:57:54,729 --> 01:57:57,289
I'll eat it later. I'm not that hungry

1171
01:57:57,289 --> 01:57:58,170
right now.

1172
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,140
Oh, had a rough day. All right, you want

1173
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:02,100
me to be an actor?

1174
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:05,460
Fine, I'll be an actor. I'm not sure.

1175
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:09,880
I quit my job. You quit your job just

1176
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:11,159
like that

1177
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:12,760
and your boss just let you? I thought

1178
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,279
you said,

1179
01:58:14,279 --> 01:58:16,359
look, I'm out and that's that. Speaking

1180
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:17,319
of which,

1181
01:58:17,319 --> 01:58:20,939
I've got a surprise for you, but what

1182
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:21,899
what is it?

1183
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:24,409
You'll see tomorrow, okay? I'm

1184
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:26,569
feeling a bit too tired right now.

1185
01:58:26,569 --> 01:58:28,729
I'm gonna head straight for bed. Are you

1186
01:58:28,729 --> 01:58:31,539
gonna stay up for a while?

1187
01:58:31,539 --> 01:58:32,979
I'm just gonna finish this show. I'll be

1188
01:58:32,979 --> 01:58:42,869
up in a minute.

1189
01:58:42,869 --> 01:58:44,779
Don't you know, acting guys, if

1190
01:58:44,779 --> 01:58:46,380
there's a question mark,

1191
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,140
make it sound like a really big

1192
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:50,619
question. Like, for instance,

1193
01:58:50,619 --> 01:58:53,579
acting class 101. If the

1194
01:58:53,579 --> 01:58:56,359
line is,

1195
01:58:56,359 --> 01:58:59,029
for instance,

1196
01:58:59,029 --> 01:59:00,710
did you go to the supermarket today?

1197
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,390
Right? Did you go to the store

1198
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:04,069
today? Did you go to the supermarket

1199
01:59:04,069 --> 01:59:04,869
today?

1200
01:59:04,949 --> 01:59:06,310
That's a guy with normal human talks,

1201
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:08,229
right? But if you're, but an actor, but

1202
01:59:08,229 --> 01:59:09,449
acting,

1203
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:12,390
did you go to the supermarket today?

1204
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:14,550
Did you go to the supermarket today?

1205
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:18,789
Did you go to the supermarket today?

1206
01:59:18,789 --> 01:59:20,310
Just, just talk like people don't

1207
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:33,460
talk and you're an actor.

1208
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:36,010
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

1209
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:37,930
Yeah, instead of just saying,

1210
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:39,210
these pretzels are drying me out.

1211
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:40,010
You ever, do you have water or

1212
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:41,609
something? These pretzels are really

1213
01:59:41,609 --> 01:59:42,569
drying my mouth out. Do you have any

1214
01:59:42,569 --> 01:59:43,850
water?

1215
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:45,449
These pretzels are really drying my

1216
01:59:45,449 --> 01:59:47,449
mouth out. Do you have any water?

1217
01:59:47,449 --> 01:59:50,920
These pretzels are really dry. I mean,

1218
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:53,260
these pretzels are really dry. These

1219
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,020
pretzels are really dry.

1220
01:59:55,020 --> 02:00:03,899
That's how you be an actor. It's drying

1221
02:00:03,899 --> 02:00:10,699
me out.

1222
02:00:10,699 --> 02:00:13,750
Uh, all right. Okay, this is, this is

1223
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:15,020
different.

1224
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:16,939
I'm just driving away with money in

1225
02:00:16,939 --> 02:00:19,130
the bag.

1226
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:20,329
You're listening, here you go, oh

1227
02:00:20,329 --> 02:00:22,970
right, by the way, actor is also radio

1228
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:25,399
host or YouTuber.

1229
02:00:25,399 --> 02:00:28,119
You're listening to WYL Miami Radio,

1230
02:00:28,119 --> 02:00:29,960
bringing you fresh new music each

1231
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,710
day.

1232
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:34,470
What you like, whenever you like.

1233
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:36,170
That's our motto.

1234
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:38,090
It's a beautiful day today, the sun is

1235
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:40,649
shining and the sky is clear.

1236
02:00:40,649 --> 02:00:42,010
Let me read that like a normal person

1237
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,810
now.

1238
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:44,970
You can't go wrong with weather like

1239
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:46,649
this, that's for sure.

1240
02:00:46,649 --> 02:00:48,409
Later today we'll be premiering a

1241
02:00:48,409 --> 02:00:50,090
hot new single from, uh,

1242
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:51,449
Perturberator.

1243
02:00:51,449 --> 02:00:53,210
Meanwhile, uh, here's another song by

1244
02:00:53,210 --> 02:00:54,489
everybody's favorite,

1245
02:00:54,489 --> 02:01:00,659
Mitch, see, acting. We interrupt the

1246
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:02,420
broadcast for an emergency weather

1247
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:03,380
report.

1248
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,060
A tropical storm is heading towards

1249
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:07,140
Florida, coming from the Atlantic.

1250
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,140
It's estimated to reach Miami by 7

1251
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:09,859
p.m.

1252
02:01:09,859 --> 02:01:16,140
We caution all residents to, my sky

1253
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:16,939
got here,

1254
02:01:16,939 --> 02:01:19,899
where are we going? I'm going away, far

1255
02:01:19,899 --> 02:01:22,789
away, anywhere, it doesn't matter to me.

1256
02:01:22,789 --> 02:01:25,430
You sure, do you even know where

1257
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,470
you're heading?

1258
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:28,140
Well the directions, a lot of people

1259
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:29,979
wind up going round in circles.

1260
02:01:29,979 --> 02:01:31,739
And this road doesn't look too

1261
02:01:31,739 --> 02:01:33,020
promising.

1262
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:36,020
I didn't ask for your opinion. What if

1263
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:37,460
I told you that this road leads to

1264
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,340
nowhere,

1265
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,840
or rather that you're heading for a

1266
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,600
dead end, that's where you're going.

1267
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,340
You're closing in on it, it's closing in

1268
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:45,460
fast,

1269
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:47,909
but you already know that, don't you? I

1270
02:01:47,909 --> 02:01:50,069
have no idea what you're talking about.

1271
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:54,310
You'll see soon enough. By the way, did

1272
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:55,829
you forget to bring your girlfriend?

1273
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:02,489
Caught the lesson I was giving you

1274
02:02:02,489 --> 02:02:04,170
there, I was being a fucking real

1275
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:05,369
actor on the chicken,

1276
02:02:05,369 --> 02:02:06,890
and I was being an actor on the

1277
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:17,270
fucking, the other guy, the driver.

1278
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:23,029
Mary? Mary? Mary? Fucking Garfield on

1279
02:02:23,029 --> 02:02:23,909
the couch.

1280
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:25,829
How do you guys pick up shit like

1281
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:27,829
that, so quickly?

1282
02:02:27,829 --> 02:02:32,260
There's a note. Hi honey, I'm sorry, I'm

1283
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,020
not doing the acting thing anymore.

1284
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:37,060
Hi honey, I'm so sorry about this.

1285
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:38,420
You would have done the same thing if

1286
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:39,699
you were me.

1287
02:02:39,699 --> 02:02:47,500
Love, Mary. He does it anyways, yeah

1288
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,060
whatever.

1289
02:02:48,060 --> 02:03:02,149
This is called Execution. Okay, you

1290
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:03,670
have reached the wrong number.

1291
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:05,909
That's the title of the game. Please

1292
02:03:05,909 --> 02:03:06,869
hang up and try again.

1293
02:03:06,869 --> 02:03:10,489
Beep beep. Listen to that baseline.

1294
02:03:10,489 --> 02:03:12,010
This is a good baseline. Oh hey, hold

1295
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:12,810
on.

1296
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:19,449
Chainsaw and guns. What the hell is

1297
02:03:19,449 --> 02:03:22,979
this?

1298
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:24,579
What the fuck? Hold on, you get your own

1299
02:03:24,579 --> 02:03:25,779
ice climbers?

1300
02:03:25,779 --> 02:03:31,350
How does this work? What the fuck? Oh my

1301
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:35,899
god, it really is the ice climbers.

1302
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:40,939
Oh, whoa, this is weird. Okay,

1303
02:03:40,939 --> 02:03:42,140
this is kind of cool. I kind of like

1304
02:03:42,140 --> 02:04:08,550
this. Who's left?

1305
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:18,859
One guy over here. I thought that was a

1306
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:20,220
guy. Okay, no we're good.

1307
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:28,170
I can't go in there? I guess not.

1308
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:30,890
All right, so how do I pick up other

1309
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:31,609
guns

1310
02:04:31,609 --> 02:04:36,229
with the, uh, what is it? What are the

1311
02:04:36,229 --> 02:04:38,229
names of the ice climbers names?

1312
02:04:38,229 --> 02:04:54,579
Does he reload? Do I have to, I think

1313
02:04:54,579 --> 02:04:55,539
I have to pick up the guns on the

1314
02:04:55,539 --> 02:04:56,739
ground, right?

1315
02:04:56,739 --> 02:05:12,630
Yeah, there we go, okay. Fuck, I had it.

1316
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:27,880
Okay, I, I, I understand. That's it.

1317
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:33,369
No, I want to pick up, I can't pick up

1318
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:34,810
the other guns, okay.

1319
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:39,979
All right, grab this other gun on the

1320
02:05:39,979 --> 02:05:43,529
ground over here. Got it, okay.

1321
02:05:43,529 --> 02:05:53,270
One guy left. Right through the front

1322
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:56,840
door.

1323
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:06,939
No, in there.

1324
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:10,739
Oh, these guys are fun. Oh, these

1325
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:12,340
guys are really fun.

1326
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:21,960
Can I do anything else? Oh, I wake up

1327
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,680
here. Wait,

1328
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:33,159
oh, I have to go in there? Look, I don't

1329
02:06:33,159 --> 02:06:33,720
know.

1330
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:36,199
I told you. There's something strange

1331
02:06:36,199 --> 02:06:37,960
going on, you know what I mean?

1332
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,239
Can you see that? Look right there. Can

1333
02:06:39,239 --> 02:06:40,779
you see it? What is that?

1334
02:06:40,779 --> 02:06:41,819
Someone must have slipped me

1335
02:06:41,819 --> 02:06:42,779
something. I mean, this can't be

1336
02:06:42,779 --> 02:06:43,579
happening.

1337
02:06:43,579 --> 02:06:45,260
It's like, wow, are those masks? Are

1338
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:47,020
we in the jungle? I want to go to

1339
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:48,300
the jungle. I quit. You know, did I

1340
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,020
tell you that?

1341
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,220
No more, I tell you. I'm out. Done.

1342
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:56,439
Finished. Holy shit.

1343
02:06:56,439 --> 02:06:58,359
What? Are you hitting me? I just want

1344
02:06:58,359 --> 02:07:00,279
to go home. Can you call Mary? She'll,

1345
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:01,909
she'll come get me.

1346
02:07:01,909 --> 02:07:03,029
Am I bleeding? Do I need to go to

1347
02:07:03,029 --> 02:07:04,460
the hospital?

1348
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:20,680
Guys, I just want to go home. Holy shit.

1349
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:25,960
That was a little, that's too bad.

1350
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:34,869
All right, we got

1351
02:07:34,869 --> 02:07:38,859
B minus. That's right. I'm gonna,

1352
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:40,619
I'm gonna march

1353
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:43,500
back home with that in my hand,

1354
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:44,699
and I'm gonna be playing

1355
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:46,619
fucking show tunes in my head,

1356
02:07:46,619 --> 02:07:48,380
while I march back to fucking hold it

1357
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:50,140
in front of me to show bomb.

1358
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:51,420
That's, I'm opening the door with it

1359
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:59,779
out in front, holding it out.

1360
02:07:59,779 --> 02:08:09,800
Mark. Third act, climax. Climax.

1361
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:15,720
I don't know if it's the heat, but I

1362
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,750
feel a bit drunk.

1363
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:19,189
Me too, I'm thinking about heading back

1364
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:20,470
to camp.

1365
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:24,390
I'm good for another round or two. You

1366
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:25,430
guys head on back.

1367
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:27,819
I'll catch up with you later. You don't

1368
02:08:27,819 --> 02:08:29,420
tell me what to do, okay?

1369
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:30,779
I'm gonna show you how to drink, you

1370
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:32,220
hear me?

1371
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,380
Well, I guess we'll see you guys back

1372
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,180
at camp then.

1373
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:36,939
Just remember that we have a job to

1374
02:08:36,939 --> 02:08:38,300
do tonight, fellas.

1375
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:49,180
Okay. Excuse me guys, you have a

1376
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:51,180
second? I'd like to get a picture of

1377
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:52,779
you if you don't mind.

1378
02:08:52,779 --> 02:08:55,579
Sure thing. Could you send me a copy

1379
02:08:55,579 --> 02:08:57,260
if I give you my address?

1380
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:59,659
No need, we have a Polaroid. Would you

1381
02:08:59,659 --> 02:09:01,340
mind stepping out into the sun here for

1382
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:09,720
a bit?

1383
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,260
Uh, do I have to do something? No, no.

1384
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:13,380
All right, good luck out there, guys.

1385
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,460
Thanks for letting me get a shot.

1386
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:17,220
No worries, man. Good luck to you too.

1387
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:31,529
Okay. Now what? Why is the world

1388
02:09:31,529 --> 02:09:32,409
spinning?

1389
02:09:32,409 --> 02:09:47,420
Uh, oh, I had to take the Polaroid.

1390
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:48,939
Okay, are we

1391
02:09:48,939 --> 02:09:50,699
trying to move out? Choose your

1392
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:51,819
weapon wisely and make

1393
02:09:51,819 --> 02:09:55,420
them shots count. Lord knows how many-

1394
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,420
So, are we at like war? I don't

1395
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:58,460
understand.

1396
02:09:59,289 --> 02:10:01,289
Do be careful, my boy. Don't want any of

1397
02:10:01,289 --> 02:10:05,640
my men dying on me.

1398
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,159
Got a special delivery coming in

1399
02:10:07,159 --> 02:10:08,920
tonight. Wouldn't want to drink all that

1400
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:09,800
bourbon alone.

1401
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:13,079
Not in this goddamn place. Uh,

1402
02:10:13,079 --> 02:10:16,199
I'm gonna say shotgun. No. Yeah. Well,

1403
02:10:16,199 --> 02:10:18,979
I have to use it now.

1404
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:29,529
Okay. So, I can't put it down.

1405
02:10:29,529 --> 02:10:32,569
Ambush. What the hell is happening

1406
02:10:32,569 --> 02:10:42,840
in this game?

1407
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:44,680
What the hell is this? All right,

1408
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:45,880
we're-

1409
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:58,220
Okay. Good thing you didn't look that

1410
02:10:58,220 --> 02:10:59,260
way.

1411
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:09,399
Oh, I can take a knife out. So, I can't

1412
02:11:09,399 --> 02:11:10,600
pick weapons up off the ground in these

1413
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:18,380
levels. All right. Whatever.

1414
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:28,409
Area clear. Can I reload?

1415
02:11:28,409 --> 02:11:31,210
Not conserving ammo. Oh, shit. Oh, all

1416
02:11:31,210 --> 02:11:46,220
right. I'll conserve ammo.

1417
02:11:46,220 --> 02:12:04,420
Caught him. Caught him. Really? All

1418
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:05,939
right. Conserving ammo.

1419
02:12:05,939 --> 02:12:12,010
How does that guy not shoot me? I

1420
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:13,210
don't know. All right. Let me pay

1421
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:14,250
attention.

1422
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:17,909
Can this guy shoot over this? Oh,

1423
02:12:17,909 --> 02:12:19,510
conserving ammo.

1424
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:23,819
Aye, aye, aye. Nobody down. Okay.

1425
02:12:23,819 --> 02:12:29,670
Just don't worry about this guy here.

1426
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:31,510
Put down there. I'm gonna have to shoot

1427
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:32,550
that guy, aren't I?

1428
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:47,529
I have to shoot this guy. Well, fuck.

1429
02:12:47,529 --> 02:12:57,930
Is that-

1430
02:12:57,930 --> 02:13:02,069
Is this ammo boxes? Where are they?

1431
02:13:02,069 --> 02:13:16,140
Are there any ammo boxes here? Shoot

1432
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:20,090
the last round.

1433
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:29,510
Shoot once. Okay. Get ammo. Okay.

1434
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:34,779
There we go. Look, we're fine. I

1435
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:36,220
didn't get- I got played. I would have

1436
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:38,140
been so upset that way. Okay.

1437
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:43,750
Were you guys trying to bait me and it

1438
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:52,699
actually worked out in my favor?

1439
02:13:52,699 --> 02:13:53,899
Oh, damn it. That would have been like

1440
02:13:53,899 --> 02:13:55,020
10 combo there.

1441
02:13:55,020 --> 02:14:01,939
Oops-a-daisy. Who the fuck am I?

1442
02:14:01,939 --> 02:14:06,470
What? What? Okay.

1443
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:35,100
Okay, that was stupid. All right. We got

1444
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:36,699
guy with the gun, guy with the blade.

1445
02:14:36,699 --> 02:14:45,859
Guy with the gun first. Bingo. Bingo!

1446
02:14:45,859 --> 02:14:47,699
James here. I'm done, uh, weeding out

1447
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:48,979
the garden. How's it going with the

1448
02:14:48,979 --> 02:14:50,250
yard?

1449
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:51,930
Hank here. I ran out of fuel for the

1450
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:54,899
lawn mowers. We're at the gas station.

1451
02:14:54,899 --> 02:14:55,939
Headed over and we'll share the

1452
02:14:55,939 --> 02:15:00,460
ride back. I'll leave the area.

1453
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:02,819
I don't think I can do anything else

1454
02:15:02,819 --> 02:15:03,619
here, so

1455
02:15:03,619 --> 02:15:11,300
mine will just go. That had to have been

1456
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:14,279
pretty good. I- that's gonna be at least

1457
02:15:14,279 --> 02:15:20,939
a B.

1458
02:15:20,939 --> 02:15:27,430
I'll take a B minus. Better than

1459
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:29,239
expected.

1460
02:15:29,239 --> 02:15:31,640
I'm even prouder to show that to mom.

1461
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:35,189
Mom doesn't expect me to get aids.

1462
02:15:35,189 --> 02:15:49,270
Weapon unlocked big and heavy. Hmm.

1463
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:51,350
Looks like he- we got our hands on

1464
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:52,789
some good intel here.

1465
02:15:52,789 --> 02:15:54,149
We should get this back to the

1466
02:15:54,149 --> 02:15:56,069
Colonel as soon as possible. Not sure

1467
02:15:56,069 --> 02:15:57,350
what to do with the captives,

1468
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:59,109
though. Maybe we should just let

1469
02:15:59,109 --> 02:16:01,590
Barnes have his way. Would make the

1470
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:02,149
jog

1471
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:07,380
back to camp a hell of a lot easier.

1472
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,819
This is the- this is- we're watching a

1473
02:16:08,819 --> 02:16:10,100
movie right now.

1474
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:13,380
Oh, pause it right there. Oh, hold on a

1475
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:15,800
second. You're trying to tell me

1476
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:20,970
that a Bluetooth brush. Uh, all right.

1477
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:31,270
Did you guys catch the news on

1478
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:32,870
channel six last night? Looks like

1479
02:16:32,870 --> 02:16:36,700
we're famous now.

1480
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:38,139
Yeah, looks like we got our five

1481
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:40,059
minutes of fame. I'd say it was

1482
02:16:40,059 --> 02:16:42,489
more like two.

1483
02:16:42,489 --> 02:16:43,850
Damn, I didn't catch it. What did

1484
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:44,969
they say?

1485
02:16:44,969 --> 02:16:46,409
Do you think you can call the news

1486
02:16:46,409 --> 02:16:48,090
station and ask for a copy?

1487
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:50,709
I mean, I'd pay big bucks to see it.

1488
02:16:50,709 --> 02:16:51,829
Why don't you call the police and

1489
02:16:51,829 --> 02:16:54,020
turn yourself in while you're at it?

1490
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:55,379
Yeah, that probably would be a good

1491
02:16:55,379 --> 02:16:57,459
idea. I'm sure they'll run another

1492
02:16:57,459 --> 02:16:59,620
story on us sooner or later anyway.

1493
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,139
I'm not so sure about that we'd have

1494
02:17:01,139 --> 02:17:04,409
to off more people first, you know?

1495
02:17:04,409 --> 02:17:05,850
He's right. Not sure what to do

1496
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,610
about that. We can't just go out and

1497
02:17:07,610 --> 02:17:10,010
kill random people now, can we?

1498
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:12,329
I might have an idea. I bought- hold

1499
02:17:12,329 --> 02:17:13,209
on.

1500
02:17:13,209 --> 02:17:17,000
I can't do Donald Duck. I bought

1501
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,920
some weed from a couple of

1502
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:34,139
creeps a few days ago.

1503
02:17:34,139 --> 02:17:50,659
Okay. He's choking.

1504
02:17:50,659 --> 02:17:53,379
He wants to go treasure hunting for more

1505
02:17:53,379 --> 02:17:57,159
drugs.

1506
02:17:57,159 --> 02:17:58,680
No, I can't. I don't know how people do

1507
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:00,040
Donald Duck. It's fucking hard.

1508
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:01,399
Well, there might be more assholes

1509
02:18:01,399 --> 02:18:03,479
there. I don't know. You got

1510
02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:04,680
anything better to do?

1511
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:05,879
I wouldn't mind going for a ride.

1512
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:08,299
Let's check it out. We could always

1513
02:18:08,299 --> 02:18:09,899
grab some pizza if we don't find

1514
02:18:09,899 --> 02:18:15,290
anything.

1515
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:16,329
Yeah, there's one thing of being

1516
02:18:16,329 --> 02:18:18,409
able to do a duck, like

1517
02:18:18,409 --> 02:18:21,049
blah, blah, you know what I'm talking

1518
02:18:21,049 --> 02:18:21,690
about.

1519
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:23,770
But being able to form words in a

1520
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:25,049
coherent sentence,

1521
02:18:25,049 --> 02:18:27,450
as the Donald Duck voice, is so hard to

1522
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:29,129
do. Two machine guns.

1523
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:30,329
I'm staying with these two. These two

1524
02:18:30,329 --> 02:18:35,780
are fun.

1525
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:43,370
Leave or die. The back? No, no, no, no,

1526
02:18:43,370 --> 02:18:44,170
no, no.

1527
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:48,219
Okay. I cased the joint successfully.

1528
02:18:48,219 --> 02:19:03,290
Let's go. Right into his gut. That's

1529
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:03,930
it.

1530
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:12,700
Done. Whoa. That's all there was to

1531
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,420
it, huh?

1532
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:17,370
Did you hear that? Hear what? Sounds

1533
02:19:17,370 --> 02:19:18,809
like someone's in that room over

1534
02:19:18,809 --> 02:19:21,190
there. I already checked it. There's

1535
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:26,920
no one in there.

1536
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:32,379
Oops. Okay. Well, we're going down even

1537
02:19:32,379 --> 02:19:35,290
further.

1538
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:36,649
I don't understand these walls. Are these

1539
02:19:36,649 --> 02:19:38,569
walls? Not really.

1540
02:19:38,569 --> 02:19:47,879
Okay. Well, I didn't get it. Okay.

1541
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:48,760
That's

1542
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:58,139
three. Shit. I missed.

1543
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:05,959
Come on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

1544
02:20:05,959 --> 02:20:07,239
Bring it on. What we got? Guy with the

1545
02:20:07,239 --> 02:20:08,120
gun?

1546
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:17,110
That's no problem for me. Keep going.

1547
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:17,989
Fast. Hurry up.

1548
02:20:17,989 --> 02:20:49,700
A plus. Let's go. Weee. Don't go crazy

1549
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,540
here.

1550
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:53,940
I fucking, my own partner just shot me

1551
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:54,819
in the head. That's what it looked

1552
02:20:54,819 --> 02:20:55,459
like.

1553
02:20:55,459 --> 02:21:01,659
I'm trying to rush. What the fuck

1554
02:21:01,659 --> 02:21:02,540
happened there?

1555
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:11,000
Give me a fucking break. How did he not

1556
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:29,610
get shot by that?

1557
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:31,610
Damn it. Trying to focus too much on

1558
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:32,409
the shooting.

1559
02:21:32,409 --> 02:21:36,149
The shooting is the backup

1560
02:21:36,149 --> 02:21:37,959
to me.

1561
02:21:37,959 --> 02:21:39,479
I was right clicking and it

1562
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:49,379
wouldn't shoot.

1563
02:21:49,379 --> 02:21:57,989
Okay. Relax. Seven bullets. Okay.

1564
02:21:57,989 --> 02:21:59,590
Dog. Don't forget about the dog. All

1565
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:01,110
right. Good. Good. Good. Good.

1566
02:22:01,110 --> 02:22:10,889
Good. Holy fuck. I almost missed. It's

1567
02:22:10,889 --> 02:22:12,409
okay. Anybody else?

1568
02:22:12,409 --> 02:22:14,170
Guy down there. He's melee. Just drag

1569
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:21,239
him up.

1570
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:33,100
Shit. Okay. Whoops. Whoops.

1571
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:54,600
I got one. Fuck. No. God damn it.

1572
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:56,120
What the hell?

1573
02:22:56,120 --> 02:23:04,739
This bullshit. Come on, man.

1574
02:23:04,739 --> 02:23:07,219
That was such dog shit. He just like

1575
02:23:07,219 --> 02:23:07,700
fucking

1576
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:12,329
insta-turned. I'm so fucking mad about

1577
02:23:12,329 --> 02:23:13,129
that one.

1578
02:23:13,129 --> 02:23:22,629
I wasn't even paying attention. Missed

1579
02:23:22,629 --> 02:23:23,989
the chance.

1580
02:23:23,989 --> 02:23:42,860
Another dog, right? I'm surprised that

1581
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:44,219
didn't get it.

1582
02:23:44,219 --> 02:23:56,280
Get that gun. Pick it up. Pick up the

1583
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,700
gun. Is there a reason why you won't

1584
02:23:58,700 --> 02:23:59,659
pick the gun up?

1585
02:23:59,659 --> 02:24:01,959
There you go. Okay. Jeez. I guess he

1586
02:24:01,959 --> 02:24:03,639
does it himself. Okay.

1587
02:24:03,639 --> 02:24:19,819
Nobody else up there, right? Just this

1588
02:24:19,819 --> 02:24:26,020
guy with the gun. Down. Down. Down.

1589
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:27,459
Down. Down. Who's down here?

1590
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:31,639
Okay. Same deal. I just gotta shoot that

1591
02:24:31,639 --> 02:24:32,440
guy.

1592
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:48,010
He's in such an awkward spot too.

1593
02:24:48,010 --> 02:25:00,420
Okay. Fine. Bye. Faster. Hurry. Hurry.

1594
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:04,250
Hurry. Go to the car. I'm going faster.

1595
02:25:04,250 --> 02:25:14,360
Secret. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster.

1596
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:15,719
I'm going. I'm trying.

1597
02:25:15,719 --> 02:25:25,500
I got some pretty decent combo. I got

1598
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,940
like it almost times nine times

1599
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:30,569
ten.

1600
02:25:30,569 --> 02:25:38,069
Small time bonus. It's okay. Got it.

1601
02:25:38,069 --> 02:25:49,049
A minus. Boomer speedrun strats. That's

1602
02:25:49,049 --> 02:25:50,649
called a regular strat.

1603
02:25:50,649 --> 02:25:53,780
Good strat. Does this change? Change

1604
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:57,559
perspective so many times in this game.

1605
02:25:57,559 --> 02:25:59,899
Who is it? It's the police. Open the

1606
02:25:59,899 --> 02:26:00,870
door.

1607
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:02,069
Fifty second. I gotta put on some

1608
02:26:02,069 --> 02:26:11,420
clothes. Okay. Wait. That was the duck.

1609
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:21,940
That's the duck costume. Police are

1610
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:26,819
already in here.

1611
02:26:26,819 --> 02:26:40,440
Can I go in the car? Okay. Who is

1612
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:48,780
that?

1613
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:50,840
How did you get in here? The door

1614
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:52,040
wasn't locked. I let myself in. I hope

1615
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:52,920
you don't mind.

1616
02:26:52,920 --> 02:27:03,719
Blind. Blind streamer. What are you

1617
02:27:03,719 --> 02:27:04,360
talking about?

1618
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:06,979
Well what do you want? I'm looking for an

1619
02:27:06,979 --> 02:27:08,260
Ash Davis.

1620
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:09,940
This is listed as his last known

1621
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:12,860
address. Well as you can see he's not

1622
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:14,299
here. I don't know where he is.

1623
02:27:14,299 --> 02:27:15,979
He doesn't live here anymore. Was there

1624
02:27:15,979 --> 02:27:21,159
anything else? Will you tell him to

1625
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:24,760
contact Miami PD next time you see him?

1626
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:26,280
You're his sister aren't you? I can

1627
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:28,040
see you got the good genes.

1628
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:30,729
You're very pretty. If there was nothing

1629
02:27:30,729 --> 02:27:33,450
else I would like for you to leave.

1630
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:38,549
Now I have to take it.

1631
02:27:38,549 --> 02:27:40,889
I'm just switching control. Who's the

1632
02:27:40,889 --> 02:27:47,590
protagonist in this game?

1633
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:54,579
Dead ahead. Oh that's interesting.

1634
02:27:54,579 --> 02:27:56,819
So I gotta pee. We're taking our

1635
02:27:56,819 --> 02:27:58,260
first break in the night. I'll be

1636
02:27:58,260 --> 02:27:59,139
right back.

1637
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:07,049
Pee time. Sorry for the static. I'll

1638
02:28:07,049 --> 02:28:07,850
mute it.

1639
02:28:07,850 --> 02:30:47,239
All right be right back. You know what

1640
02:30:47,239 --> 02:30:49,239
might think would be funny?

1641
02:30:49,239 --> 02:30:52,920
If I use this

1642
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,360
on every view right back and the new

1643
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:55,959
viewers just have no fucking idea

1644
02:30:55,959 --> 02:30:58,940
what's happening.

1645
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:11,450
What my cam's on? Oh okay. I've

1646
02:31:11,450 --> 02:31:12,729
refreshed the page and I had no

1647
02:31:12,729 --> 02:31:15,879
idea what was going on.

1648
02:31:15,879 --> 02:31:22,180
Uh all right we're back.

1649
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:23,620
And by the way hold on let me just open

1650
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:26,950
up this uh

1651
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:36,940
fresh beer. Coors light.

1652
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:40,860
Now you are a boomer. It's I'm drink

1653
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:42,379
it's a coca cola. It's just a

1654
02:31:42,379 --> 02:31:46,040
fucking coke.

1655
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:47,559
Is it monster? Why would I drink a

1656
02:31:47,559 --> 02:31:49,739
monster energy drink?

1657
02:31:49,739 --> 02:31:50,940
What the hell would I ever do that

1658
02:31:50,940 --> 02:32:00,280
for? What? Wait what's down here?

1659
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:09,399
This is like really this is like

1660
02:32:09,399 --> 02:32:11,079
really thick coke though.

1661
02:32:11,079 --> 02:32:12,680
Like this is this supposed to be like

1662
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:13,639
this?

1663
02:32:13,639 --> 02:32:25,129
You know what I mean? Chewy. Is this

1664
02:32:25,129 --> 02:32:26,409
supposed to be chewy?

1665
02:32:26,409 --> 02:32:39,299
That's weird. What the fuck happened?

1666
02:32:39,299 --> 02:32:42,329
What? What character am I? Oh it's me

1667
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:43,370
right there.

1668
02:32:43,370 --> 02:32:49,340
Come on keep it up. Keep it up. Come

1669
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:51,620
on. Keep up the punch.

1670
02:32:51,620 --> 02:33:09,639
Wow. My god. Fucking guy with a

1671
02:33:09,639 --> 02:33:30,709
machine gun.

1672
02:33:30,709 --> 02:33:34,659
Hmm I got an idea. Come over here.

1673
02:33:34,659 --> 02:33:42,889
You god come over here. And you hit

1674
02:33:42,889 --> 02:33:44,010
me behind a wall.

1675
02:33:44,010 --> 02:33:45,129
I'm trying to bait that guy. Why

1676
02:33:45,129 --> 02:33:48,090
would the guys look at me?

1677
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:49,690
Just staring at me and he just won't come

1678
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:51,180
over here.

1679
02:33:51,180 --> 02:34:02,819
You fucking dummy. All right get the

1680
02:34:02,819 --> 02:34:11,739
fuck over here.

1681
02:34:11,739 --> 02:34:17,209
You. You come over here. Okay who's left?

1682
02:34:17,209 --> 02:34:18,569
That guy. That guy. That guy. I gotta

1683
02:34:18,569 --> 02:34:21,879
throw.

1684
02:34:21,879 --> 02:34:23,479
How the hell am I gonna do this? I

1685
02:34:23,479 --> 02:34:26,819
gotta go up to here.

1686
02:34:26,819 --> 02:34:30,149
Gun. Who's first? This guy right

1687
02:34:30,149 --> 02:34:31,110
here.

1688
02:34:31,110 --> 02:34:35,030
Oh and I right clicked.

1689
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:56,200
Yeah um why is it going over him?

1690
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:02,120
What the fuck is happening? I don't

1691
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:03,079
know.

1692
02:35:03,079 --> 02:35:06,299
He's. They're ducking. I get it. I

1693
02:35:06,299 --> 02:35:07,579
understand. I get it. I get it. Everybody

1694
02:35:07,579 --> 02:35:08,700
watch it.

1695
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:13,819
I get it. Stand up. Gotcha.

1696
02:35:13,819 --> 02:35:16,860
Fuck. I have one bullet. Oh that's not

1697
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:20,440
good.

1698
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:23,639
Oh I can't. I can't duck.

1699
02:35:23,639 --> 02:35:39,110
This is a fun game. You know what? Dude I don't know how the hell

1700
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:42,549
you could beat this in 10 seconds.

1701
02:35:42,549 --> 02:35:44,629
You gotta be real damn good at

1702
02:35:44,629 --> 02:35:45,670
this.

1703
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:49,610
Don't want to. This guy's gonna

1704
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:51,370
collapse on me if I don't take him out

1705
02:35:51,370 --> 02:35:51,850
right now.

1706
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:54,170
Almost died again. All right here we go.

1707
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:56,170
I gotta get a better spot. I like this

1708
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:57,610
spot up here.

1709
02:35:57,610 --> 02:35:59,049
Because it's near more guns. I can get

1710
02:35:59,049 --> 02:36:01,959
this guy while being blocked.

1711
02:36:01,959 --> 02:36:05,159
You fucking stupid video game. Who even

1712
02:36:05,159 --> 02:36:06,360
plays these anymore?

1713
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:07,479
Who even plays these anymore?

1714
02:36:07,479 --> 02:36:13,530
Seriously. Fucking video games right?

1715
02:36:13,530 --> 02:36:29,670
Like oh why why would you play them?

1716
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:31,030
You gotta be kidding me. Who even

1717
02:36:31,030 --> 02:36:50,889
fucking plays them anymore?

1718
02:36:50,889 --> 02:36:58,010
Who even fucking plays them? See me.

1719
02:36:58,010 --> 02:37:07,799
All right. Oh boomer rage.

1720
02:37:07,799 --> 02:37:10,280
Why did he not stand up and his friend

1721
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:12,620
underneath him did?

1722
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:15,100
He has a clear shot and he doesn't

1723
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:22,500
stand up but the other guy does.

1724
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:24,020
I can't even hit the first guy

1725
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:29,260
anymore.

1726
02:37:29,260 --> 02:37:35,270
I'm so fucking angry at this.

1727
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:36,469
They don't make video games like

1728
02:37:36,469 --> 02:37:37,829
they used to. Remember how easy they

1729
02:37:37,829 --> 02:37:40,020
used to be?

1730
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:43,139
Do you remember? God I missed like

1731
02:37:43,139 --> 02:37:45,860
the golden age of video games.

1732
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:49,299
Remember back? Remember Mega Man 4?

1733
02:37:49,299 --> 02:37:52,260
You remember that one? Yeah I do.

1734
02:37:52,260 --> 02:37:53,860
Yeah I remember being unbearable and

1735
02:37:53,860 --> 02:37:55,700
almost unplayably difficult.

1736
02:37:55,700 --> 02:37:57,209
And you had to start the whole game

1737
02:37:57,209 --> 02:37:58,489
over again if you lost like three

1738
02:37:58,489 --> 02:37:59,290
times.

1739
02:37:59,290 --> 02:38:00,920
Remember that video game used to be

1740
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:07,100
so much easier?

1741
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:17,879
Oh my god. I remember Castlevania.

1742
02:38:17,879 --> 02:38:21,739
That was such a fucking fun game. I

1743
02:38:21,739 --> 02:38:23,479
loved having

1744
02:38:23,479 --> 02:38:25,799
one item to attack with and and get

1745
02:38:25,799 --> 02:38:27,639
you get bounced around.

1746
02:38:27,639 --> 02:38:31,780
Hey remember Donkey Kong Country? That

1747
02:38:31,780 --> 02:38:33,299
game was fucking... Remember how awesome

1748
02:38:33,299 --> 02:38:34,420
that game was?

1749
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:36,579
Hey go play one of the bounce around

1750
02:38:36,579 --> 02:38:37,860
and the barrels levels and you tell

1751
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:40,459
me how great that game is.

1752
02:38:40,459 --> 02:38:43,020
Get past like the second world in

1753
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:44,219
Donkey Kong Country and then you

1754
02:38:44,219 --> 02:38:45,579
tell me

1755
02:38:45,579 --> 02:39:13,500
if games used to be fucking easy.

1756
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:21,940
Yeah!

1757
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:23,940
Wowee! Where'd you come from? Oh wowee!

1758
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:25,219
Is that like my new fucking catch

1759
02:39:25,219 --> 02:39:26,340
phrase?

1760
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:27,860
Did you... is that as you pull the

1761
02:39:27,860 --> 02:39:29,139
cord on my back and that's what I

1762
02:39:29,139 --> 02:39:30,440
say?

1763
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:34,680
I have four phrases.

1764
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:42,459
Wowee!

1765
02:39:42,459 --> 02:39:49,479
What the hell?

1766
02:39:49,479 --> 02:40:08,969
Suck a fart out of my ass!

1767
02:40:08,969 --> 02:40:10,729
Dude I keep forgetting that's not a...

1768
02:40:10,729 --> 02:40:12,489
this is not a wall right here. I keep

1769
02:40:12,489 --> 02:40:13,370
thinking it is.

1770
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:23,030
Sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint

1771
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:24,790
sprint sprint oh no don't sprint.

1772
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:34,540
All right there's a there's a spot

1773
02:40:34,540 --> 02:40:35,420
right here that I'm not gonna get

1774
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:37,100
shot because I can walk past that.

1775
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:38,540
All right so easy now. This is a

1776
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:39,819
safe zone.

1777
02:40:39,819 --> 02:40:46,459
Why don't you come over here? After three

1778
02:40:46,459 --> 02:40:54,600
attempts I finally got the gun.

1779
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,280
And if you miss don't worry you always

1780
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:57,879
get a second chance. All right what

1781
02:40:57,879 --> 02:41:09,879
is left in here? Oh my god I almost just

1782
02:41:09,879 --> 02:41:10,600
didn't...

1783
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:17,139
okay. Stage clear. Fast one two three

1784
02:41:17,139 --> 02:41:30,139
go!

1785
02:41:30,139 --> 02:41:53,959
You fucking dummy. All right who's left?

1786
02:41:53,959 --> 02:41:56,200
What the fuck was that guy? Where was

1787
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:57,639
he?

1788
02:41:57,639 --> 02:41:59,319
Did what happened? I'm so confused

1789
02:41:59,319 --> 02:42:01,079
right now. What happened?

1790
02:42:01,079 --> 02:42:03,370
I don't even know where the guy

1791
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:08,790
where that guy was. What the heck?

1792
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:27,639
Did that guy shoot himself?

1793
02:42:27,719 --> 02:42:29,639
I fucking tried to throw.

1794
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:43,139
I got stuck in them. Fucking doorway.

1795
02:42:43,139 --> 02:42:45,059
It's like my guy's body is made out

1796
02:42:45,059 --> 02:42:47,540
of magnets and when you touch a door

1797
02:42:47,540 --> 02:43:03,299
you just get sucked into it. Bring the

1798
02:43:03,299 --> 02:43:04,180
other fucking dog up here.

1799
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,299
Just do it. I mean just do it. The

1800
02:43:05,299 --> 02:43:11,670
dog's coming. Just bring it.

1801
02:43:11,670 --> 02:43:35,860
Oh my god damn it. Why? Where the

1802
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:36,659
fuck are you?

1803
02:43:36,659 --> 02:43:38,979
Okay don't let some random guy get

1804
02:43:38,979 --> 02:43:39,860
out of bed.

1805
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:41,540
It's like fucking Minecraft bed and

1806
02:43:41,540 --> 02:43:59,270
come get me. I need a better view.

1807
02:43:59,270 --> 02:44:01,350
All right so there's nobody with a gun

1808
02:44:01,350 --> 02:44:02,229
over there.

1809
02:44:02,229 --> 02:44:03,670
So I can get down into that room but

1810
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:04,469
I gotta be careful because of the

1811
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:26,760
windows.

1812
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:29,059
Anybody in that room? Okay there's one

1813
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:30,100
more guy.

1814
02:44:30,100 --> 02:44:34,100
All right I think I can get. I got six

1815
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:35,219
shots.

1816
02:44:35,219 --> 02:44:37,700
Nobody in there has a gun. This guy's

1817
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:40,280
I did not expect that to happen that

1818
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:41,239
quickly.

1819
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:46,549
Got it okay. Ooh tough game we got

1820
02:44:46,549 --> 02:44:48,469
here. Tough game.

1821
02:44:48,469 --> 02:45:04,739
Is that it? No. Hold on let me. Tough game

1822
02:45:04,739 --> 02:45:10,780
we got here.

1823
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:21,739
Whoa shit there's a window.

1824
02:45:21,739 --> 02:45:23,420
What the fuck are you doing? Get up you

1825
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:24,620
fucking idiot.

1826
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:30,229
Why?

1827
02:45:30,229 --> 02:45:33,079
Okay we're safe. Just shoot the

1828
02:45:33,079 --> 02:45:34,840
duck as I walk by.

1829
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:58,229
Oh fuck. What am I doing? Why would you

1830
02:45:58,229 --> 02:45:59,750
even walk up there? There's no reason

1831
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:01,750
for you to do what you just did.

1832
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:16,379
My hand's in the air.

1833
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:27,989
That was pretty good too. That's

1834
02:46:27,989 --> 02:46:37,430
pretty good.

1835
02:46:37,510 --> 02:46:57,030
Oh it's a dog.

1836
02:46:57,030 --> 02:47:02,680
And it's is one fucking pixel away

1837
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:03,559
apparently.

1838
02:47:03,559 --> 02:47:30,440
Okay easy. I'm just I don't care.

1839
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:41,479
Line them up. I'm just testing my it's just

1840
02:47:41,479 --> 02:47:44,180
a patience test.

1841
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:45,940
This is a gear check for me to see if

1842
02:47:45,940 --> 02:48:04,340
I'm patient at all.

1843
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:06,180
I'm eating my coke. I'm chewing on my

1844
02:48:06,180 --> 02:48:15,930
chewy coke.

1845
02:48:15,930 --> 02:48:36,579
I'm just trying to go too fast. Okay

1846
02:48:36,579 --> 02:48:43,139
get guns? No. Anybody with a gun in

1847
02:48:43,139 --> 02:48:45,979
there?

1848
02:48:45,979 --> 02:48:55,190
I don't know. I don't know. That's the

1849
02:48:55,190 --> 02:49:06,569
only good. That's what comes with rooms.

1850
02:49:06,569 --> 02:49:10,659
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey oh

1851
02:49:10,659 --> 02:49:19,059
oh oh where do I go? Oh my god what am I

1852
02:49:19,059 --> 02:49:19,620
doing?

1853
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:21,459
I don't know what I'm doing. I gotta

1854
02:49:21,459 --> 02:49:36,979
go this way.

1855
02:49:36,979 --> 02:49:46,549
What hey wait a minute.

1856
02:49:52,780 --> 02:49:56,569
Fuck. I'm so I had a gun.

1857
02:49:56,569 --> 02:49:58,649
I didn't even think I had a gun. How

1858
02:49:58,649 --> 02:50:00,969
was I supposed to? No.

1859
02:50:00,969 --> 02:50:07,770
I was supposed to. Oh my fucking

1860
02:50:07,770 --> 02:50:11,559
god. Who made this game? Why did you

1861
02:50:11,559 --> 02:50:12,440
make this game?

1862
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:16,780
Why did you make this game? Why did

1863
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:23,420
what did you make this game for?

1864
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:32,229
Fucking door. I made this game for you.

1865
02:50:32,229 --> 02:50:36,620
Why are they there? No.

1866
02:50:36,620 --> 02:50:39,180
Oh I'm gonna unravel. I'm gonna

1867
02:50:39,180 --> 02:50:40,139
unravel.

1868
02:50:40,139 --> 02:50:41,500
Mm-hmm. No that's gonna happen. We're

1869
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:42,780
already like three hours into this and

1870
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:43,739
I'm like I'm already fucking

1871
02:50:43,739 --> 02:50:51,079
unraveling.

1872
02:50:51,079 --> 02:50:59,700
All right. Okay how many shots does

1873
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,180
I shot three times?

1874
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:26,180
I don't want that guy to even see me.

1875
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:31,639
I've unraveled completely.

1876
02:51:31,639 --> 02:51:35,350
Wowie.

1877
02:51:35,350 --> 02:51:48,569
Where are we?

1878
02:51:48,569 --> 02:51:56,729
Fucking god. They just have so many

1879
02:51:56,729 --> 02:52:00,170
angles.

1880
02:52:00,170 --> 02:52:03,209
There's so many angles on me. It's

1881
02:52:03,209 --> 02:52:14,090
horrible.

1882
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:16,809
Give me the fucking god. What? Why

1883
02:52:16,809 --> 02:52:17,610
does it

1884
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:21,850
not? Why? I want to pick the gun up off

1885
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:22,729
the fucking

1886
02:52:22,729 --> 02:52:32,409
ground. I'm gonna go I'm gonna literally

1887
02:52:32,409 --> 02:52:33,850
just gonna say I'm gonna take 15

1888
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:35,049
straight minutes to beat this. I'm

1889
02:52:35,049 --> 02:52:37,049
gonna go as slow as humanly possible.

1890
02:52:37,049 --> 02:52:39,610
Ready? I'm literally gonna take 25

1891
02:52:39,610 --> 02:52:41,450
fucking minutes starting now. Count.

1892
02:52:41,450 --> 02:53:11,110
Where's the gun? I need another gun. I need

1893
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:13,379
another gun.

1894
02:53:13,379 --> 02:53:17,379
Oh my god the fucking perfect angle.

1895
02:53:17,379 --> 02:53:33,540
Give me a fucking break. Oh my god

1896
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:34,180
this is just

1897
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:50,309
pain the video game. Oh and like all the

1898
02:53:50,309 --> 02:53:51,110
sudden that guy

1899
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:52,790
that that guy let me look at that guy

1900
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:55,909
just fucking sprinted down to shoot me.

1901
02:53:55,909 --> 02:53:58,069
Where was that guy? Why was he the

1902
02:53:58,069 --> 02:53:58,790
only one that

1903
02:53:58,790 --> 02:54:01,799
sprinted to my exact location? He's

1904
02:54:01,799 --> 02:54:02,920
the only one that saw me.

1905
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:06,739
Only guy. I'm just gonna sprint to

1906
02:54:06,739 --> 02:54:08,889
his exact location to shoot him.

1907
02:54:08,889 --> 02:54:12,649
What? Why did this fucking guy not

1908
02:54:12,649 --> 02:54:13,450
see me? This guy.

1909
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:15,530
That guy. This guy. No guy like a guy

1910
02:54:15,530 --> 02:54:16,809
all the fucking way up here was

1911
02:54:16,809 --> 02:54:18,090
like yeah that's right I'll go this

1912
02:54:18,090 --> 02:54:53,879
way.

1913
02:54:53,879 --> 02:55:04,309
Oh no noooo.

1914
02:55:04,309 --> 02:55:11,260
This level is a pleb filter.

1915
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:12,860
Oh it's called I'm unraveling. I had

1916
02:55:12,860 --> 02:55:16,100
the fucking level beat already

1917
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:18,020
and one of these dickheads accidentally

1918
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:19,059
killed me up there then I got the

1919
02:55:19,059 --> 02:55:20,819
whole fucking thing over again.

1920
02:55:20,819 --> 02:55:30,229
And there's another this is another

1921
02:55:30,229 --> 02:55:32,870
dog. Well this is just fucking

1922
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:33,670
wonderful. What the hell am I

1923
02:55:33,670 --> 02:55:44,569
supposed to do about this?

1924
02:55:44,569 --> 02:55:46,409
Jesus god give me the gun for the

1925
02:55:46,409 --> 02:55:51,670
love of all the desacred.

1926
02:55:51,670 --> 02:55:52,870
Up there. Guy can shoot all the way

1927
02:55:52,870 --> 02:55:54,979
from fucking there down here.

1928
02:55:54,979 --> 02:56:04,010
Fuck off. You know we call that we call

1929
02:56:04,010 --> 02:56:05,530
that bullshit.

1930
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:13,850
Oh my god. Why do those fucking guys

1931
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:14,969
have to exist in a game where

1932
02:56:14,969 --> 02:56:16,170
everybody dies in one hit?

1933
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:18,170
The guy that takes like five. It's

1934
02:56:18,170 --> 02:56:21,510
just oh my god.

1935
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:38,469
It's driving me crazy.

1936
02:56:38,469 --> 02:56:45,860
Fuck this level. This is the longest

1937
02:56:45,860 --> 02:56:47,139
I've spent on a level in the two

1938
02:56:47,139 --> 02:56:49,379
fucking both of these games.

1939
02:56:49,379 --> 02:56:59,049
I'm so angry that I didn't hit any

1940
02:56:59,049 --> 02:57:05,290
of those. I hate the doors. Remove

1941
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:06,090
the doors.

1942
02:57:06,090 --> 02:57:07,290
Is there like a cheat I can put in

1943
02:57:07,290 --> 02:57:09,290
to remove all doors from the game?

1944
02:57:09,290 --> 02:57:18,889
They just they're just a hindrance. They

1945
02:57:18,889 --> 02:57:20,780
just get in the fucking way.

1946
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:22,059
All doors. When are they gonna can I

1947
02:57:22,059 --> 02:57:27,000
patch that in? Oh fucking god I don't

1948
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:27,639
have

1949
02:57:27,639 --> 02:57:53,690
him god. Somebody said this is the

1950
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:54,889
this is one of the worst missions in

1951
02:57:54,889 --> 02:57:55,690
the game.

1952
02:57:55,690 --> 02:58:02,709
All right I don't I don't get it. So

1953
02:58:02,709 --> 02:58:04,469
you shoot the big guy. They literally

1954
02:58:04,469 --> 02:58:05,829
don't die for like five straight

1955
02:58:05,829 --> 02:58:06,790
seconds and then they die. You only

1956
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:20,010
have to shoot them once.

1957
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:22,090
I hate this level. This is ruining

1958
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:39,770
the whole game for me.

1959
02:58:39,770 --> 02:58:45,190
This level. I think this is the level

1960
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:46,309
that made me stop playing. Is that are

1961
02:58:46,309 --> 02:58:47,350
you really for real?

1962
02:58:47,350 --> 02:58:59,260
Is it not just me? I heard a dog.

1963
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:00,620
Where the fuck is he?

1964
02:59:00,620 --> 02:59:16,780
I only have two bullets. Now what the

1965
02:59:16,780 --> 02:59:17,899
fuck am I gonna do?

1966
02:59:17,899 --> 02:59:27,350
None of those guys have guns. Don't get

1967
02:59:27,350 --> 02:59:28,790
seen by these guys. That happens

1968
02:59:28,790 --> 02:59:29,989
every time.

1969
02:59:29,989 --> 02:59:37,719
Oh my fucking god.

1970
02:59:37,719 --> 02:59:58,100
Why?

1971
02:59:58,100 --> 02:59:59,860
Uh where did that guy come from?

1972
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:00,819
Did he shoot me from? Oh yeah oh

1973
03:00:00,819 --> 03:00:01,860
well sorry you shot me.

1974
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:03,139
Is it the guy that shot me from across the whole

1975
03:00:03,139 --> 03:00:04,979
game through the window?

1976
03:00:04,979 --> 03:00:06,420
I was just curious.

1977
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:31,879
Now what the fuck. I gotta make it across but oh

1978
03:00:31,879 --> 03:00:32,920
there he is.

1979
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:54,280
Okay got him. What are these fucking

1980
03:00:54,280 --> 03:00:55,319
patrols?

1981
03:00:55,319 --> 03:00:57,799
How many more people you got in that room

1982
03:00:57,799 --> 03:00:58,760
with a gun?

1983
03:00:58,760 --> 03:01:18,200
Why is this guy still in Anor Londo?

1984
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:23,819
I have to go around this way.

1985
03:01:23,819 --> 03:01:25,579
Anybody with a gun over here?

1986
03:01:25,579 --> 03:01:32,329
No there's not. Okay. I have two

1987
03:01:32,329 --> 03:01:33,370
bullets.

1988
03:01:33,370 --> 03:01:50,860
Fuck. I'm gonna get sniped from

1989
03:01:50,860 --> 03:01:52,299
across the map aren't I?

1990
03:01:52,299 --> 03:01:58,489
I thought the waves was a gun.

1991
03:01:58,489 --> 03:02:00,010
All right nobody else has a gun but

1992
03:02:00,010 --> 03:02:00,809
neither do I.

1993
03:02:00,809 --> 03:02:02,889
This is not good. This is really bad.

1994
03:02:02,889 --> 03:02:08,250
I need to get one of those guns.

1995
03:02:08,250 --> 03:02:15,860
Preferably the shotgun. Got it. Okay.

1996
03:02:15,860 --> 03:02:18,100
I'm going back. No. Stay over here.

1997
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:26,950
Is that it? Don't. There's anybody coming around the

1998
03:02:26,950 --> 03:02:28,309
sides. There's anybody coming around the

1999
03:02:28,309 --> 03:02:29,989
sides. Just kill me.

2000
03:02:29,989 --> 03:02:36,600
Where's the other guy? Where is this

2001
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:38,200
last person?

2002
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:42,360
Oh my. Thank god. Oh my fucking god get

2003
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:43,829
me out of here.

2004
03:02:43,829 --> 03:02:53,379
I hate this. This is the worst level ever. I hate this. No. This way.

2005
03:02:53,379 --> 03:03:01,190
There's more.

2006
03:03:01,750 --> 03:03:04,469
I'm gonna cry.

2007
03:03:04,469 --> 03:03:25,510
I almost just cried on stream.

2008
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:30,860
Doing it right. Look. What are these

2009
03:03:30,860 --> 03:03:31,899
guys?

2010
03:03:31,899 --> 03:03:37,959
It's the windows that just do it to

2011
03:03:37,959 --> 03:03:46,280
me man. I just can't handle it.

2012
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:52,809
Okay. There's too many things to pay attention to.

2013
03:03:52,809 --> 03:03:54,170
Like somebody can if someone when people

2014
03:03:54,170 --> 03:03:55,610
can just shoot you across the whole

2015
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:56,819
map.

2016
03:03:56,819 --> 03:03:59,700
This makes you so paranoid. Like that

2017
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:00,979
guy right there can shoot through the

2018
03:04:00,979 --> 03:04:22,969
whole game over here to kill me.

2019
03:04:22,969 --> 03:04:27,059
God. Oh you bastard game with the

2020
03:04:27,059 --> 03:04:33,540
fucking door.

2021
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:35,780
Fucking door. Man rip it off the

2022
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,819
hinges.

2023
03:04:36,819 --> 03:04:37,860
Is there a character that puts a

2024
03:04:37,860 --> 03:04:38,899
mask on that could rip the fucking

2025
03:04:38,899 --> 03:04:57,930
door off the hinges?

2026
03:04:57,930 --> 03:05:00,329
Gee. And where did you come from?

2027
03:05:00,329 --> 03:05:06,260
This is a guy with a shotgun up here

2028
03:05:06,260 --> 03:05:27,479
apparently somehow.

2029
03:05:27,479 --> 03:05:59,110
Fucking god. I can do it too asshole.

2030
03:05:59,110 --> 03:06:02,389
No god. Fucking windows

2031
03:06:02,389 --> 03:06:13,260
are everywhere. I'm so paranoid.

2032
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:16,739
If I step foot out there I'm dead.

2033
03:06:16,739 --> 03:06:19,819
I'm gonna can I go down? I'm gonna try

2034
03:06:19,819 --> 03:06:28,299
going this way.

2035
03:06:28,299 --> 03:06:31,430
Window right there. You gotta be

2036
03:06:31,430 --> 03:06:32,950
fucking kidding me. I like

2037
03:06:32,950 --> 03:06:35,030
the windows man. That just just makes

2038
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:36,709
it so easy

2039
03:06:36,709 --> 03:07:01,500
for you to get shot from anywhere.

2040
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:03,020
You can win by just spraying but

2041
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:04,379
yeah but I

2042
03:07:04,379 --> 03:07:05,819
I'm gonna alert the whole room and then

2043
03:07:05,819 --> 03:07:07,819
I'm gonna get collapsed on.

2044
03:07:07,819 --> 03:07:16,040
Where the fuck did that guy come from?

2045
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:21,290
What was he doing over here?

2046
03:07:21,290 --> 03:07:22,969
Who is the AI director spawning in

2047
03:07:22,969 --> 03:07:29,940
these enemies?

2048
03:07:29,940 --> 03:08:12,149
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2049
03:08:12,149 --> 03:08:13,909
Goddamn game man.

2050
03:08:13,909 --> 03:08:15,989
This goddamn fucking game.

2051
03:08:15,989 --> 03:08:19,030
Did the same guys make the first one

2052
03:08:19,030 --> 03:08:20,149
and the second one?

2053
03:08:20,149 --> 03:08:22,469
This is the same team that made the

2054
03:08:22,469 --> 03:08:38,600
second one?

2055
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:46,010
God damn it.

2056
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:56,420
He's supposed to die. Fucking Jesus.

2057
03:08:56,420 --> 03:08:59,219
Only shoot him once and he'll die.

2058
03:08:59,219 --> 03:09:00,819
He did.

2059
03:09:00,819 --> 03:09:02,840
I feel like way more than the first

2060
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:05,000
game. Like moving a quarter of an inch

2061
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:08,709
kills you in this one.

2062
03:09:08,709 --> 03:09:10,069
Am I right on that?

2063
03:09:10,069 --> 03:09:11,590
Is it like moving three inches kills

2064
03:09:11,590 --> 03:09:34,389
you in this game?

2065
03:09:34,389 --> 03:09:54,389
He's like I feel like I just have to

2066
03:09:54,389 --> 03:09:56,229
stand in the same corner

2067
03:09:56,229 --> 03:10:01,000
the whole time. Because if I move

2068
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:02,440
it's just there's a hundred people

2069
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:04,520
that just have 20 different angles

2070
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:06,120
with like sniper rifles.

2071
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:36,709
I'm out of bullets. All right so

2072
03:10:36,709 --> 03:10:54,840
give me this.

2073
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:57,739
One guy with a gun. There's more

2074
03:10:57,739 --> 03:10:58,860
than one guy with a gun.

2075
03:10:58,860 --> 03:11:09,799
Empty. Anybody have a gun over here?

2076
03:11:09,799 --> 03:11:11,000
Somebody has to have a gun.

2077
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:24,149
What the fuck was that aim? What the hell

2078
03:11:24,149 --> 03:11:25,350
are you shooting at?

2079
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:34,420
Try another one. Try to try a shotgun

2080
03:11:34,420 --> 03:11:35,540
this time.

2081
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:44,709
Shoot through the game. I think that's

2082
03:11:44,709 --> 03:11:54,170
it. Get me out of here please.

2083
03:11:54,170 --> 03:12:13,420
That was the worst one by far. Where the

2084
03:12:13,420 --> 03:12:14,459
fuck am I going?

2085
03:12:14,459 --> 03:12:22,889
I forgot how long ago that was

2086
03:12:22,889 --> 03:12:24,489
because I hated that part too.

2087
03:12:24,489 --> 03:12:36,569
You haven't seen the worst. There are

2088
03:12:36,569 --> 03:12:39,899
still more horrors.

2089
03:12:39,899 --> 03:12:42,840
Really? You know you shoot it out.

2090
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:50,180
Really? There's a level later on that

2091
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:52,260
turns your keyboard into acid.

2092
03:13:00,200 --> 03:13:01,479
You know you should really wait for

2093
03:13:01,479 --> 03:13:02,760
backup in these situations.

2094
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:04,459
It's not my fault you guys took so

2095
03:13:04,459 --> 03:13:05,659
long to get here, is it?

2096
03:13:05,659 --> 03:13:08,840
I got here first. You got a problem with

2097
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:11,319
that? What are you doing? You're reckless.

2098
03:13:11,319 --> 03:13:12,600
Your actions endanger this whole

2099
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:15,049
operation. Give me a break.

2100
03:13:15,049 --> 03:13:16,659
Operation? What are you talking about?

2101
03:13:16,659 --> 03:13:17,940
You don't like it? Go complain to the

2102
03:13:17,940 --> 03:13:19,139
chief. I'm out of here.

2103
03:13:19,139 --> 03:13:22,659
I'm out of here. Is it right? Just

2104
03:13:22,659 --> 03:13:25,030
get me to the next level.

2105
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:28,579
I can look at the game with a fresh

2106
03:13:28,579 --> 03:13:30,420
new start after that one.

2107
03:13:30,420 --> 03:13:42,170
A nice chill stream. Somehow I got a

2108
03:13:42,170 --> 03:13:43,610
C plus on that. It would take 40

2109
03:13:43,610 --> 03:13:44,969
minutes to do that. How did I get a

2110
03:13:44,969 --> 03:13:46,569
C plus on that one but like a fucking

2111
03:13:46,569 --> 03:13:48,010
D on the other one? And I did the

2112
03:13:48,010 --> 03:13:49,530
other one way cleaner.

2113
03:13:49,530 --> 03:13:52,090
This one took 40 minutes. How did I get

2114
03:13:52,090 --> 03:13:54,950
a D on the other one and a C on that?

2115
03:13:54,950 --> 03:14:00,420
I don't understand. Let me guess our

2116
03:14:00,420 --> 03:14:03,620
serial killer has been at it again.

2117
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:09,450
What gave it away? He left another

2118
03:14:09,450 --> 03:14:10,889
message for us, mundane as ever.

2119
03:14:10,889 --> 03:14:12,729
Please don't make me do it again.

2120
03:14:12,729 --> 03:14:14,649
Well at least he got a bit creative

2121
03:14:14,649 --> 03:14:16,649
with the victim. Poor kid.

2122
03:14:16,649 --> 03:14:18,180
Maybe he was upset that the papers

2123
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:20,500
haven't made a bigger deal of them.

2124
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:22,020
These scumbags seem to crave

2125
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:24,579
attention. I gotta relax. I'm so angry

2126
03:14:24,579 --> 03:14:26,250
at that last level.

2127
03:14:26,250 --> 03:14:35,020
I can still feel it. Red check.

2128
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:40,040
Am I like fucking red? I got like a red

2129
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:41,540
nose.

2130
03:14:41,540 --> 03:14:48,520
I'm like red down here. Not really.

2131
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:52,010
All right, well that's fine. I'm

2132
03:14:52,010 --> 03:15:05,799
looking at the wrong camera.

2133
03:15:05,799 --> 03:15:09,579
You expected it at out of sync. Don't

2134
03:15:09,579 --> 03:15:11,260
we all, huh? You might be getting your

2135
03:15:11,260 --> 03:15:12,780
fair share once this gets out.

2136
03:15:12,780 --> 03:15:14,059
Think you can handle the pressure? All

2137
03:15:14,059 --> 03:15:15,579
eyes will be on you now.

2138
03:15:15,579 --> 03:15:17,159
I'm sure this guy will slip up

2139
03:15:17,159 --> 03:15:18,840
sooner or later. Speaking of which,

2140
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:19,959
what have you got from me? Any

2141
03:15:19,959 --> 03:15:21,159
findings?

2142
03:15:21,159 --> 03:15:22,760
Not much. No murder, weapon, and no win. I

2143
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:26,299
gotta relax.

2144
03:15:26,299 --> 03:15:44,979
Change of plans. I need like a

2145
03:15:44,979 --> 03:15:46,659
meditation video.

2146
03:15:46,659 --> 03:15:55,780
I need to do a meditation. Guided

2147
03:15:55,780 --> 03:15:56,659
meditation.

2148
03:15:56,659 --> 03:16:08,260
Hold on. I'm gonna mute this for a

2149
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:09,459
second. I have to do this, guys. I'm

2150
03:16:09,459 --> 03:16:10,180
sorry.

2151
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:29,899
I'm like, I'm all fired up. It's

2152
03:16:29,899 --> 03:16:34,180
supposed to be instructions.

2153
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:36,500
Thank you for being here, dear soul.

2154
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:38,739
I'm Kenneth, and from my heart, I

2155
03:16:38,739 --> 03:16:40,979
will... Is this the cheers for you guy?

2156
03:16:40,979 --> 03:16:42,739
This is the cheers to you guy? I think

2157
03:16:42,739 --> 03:16:44,180
this is the cheers to you.

2158
03:16:44,180 --> 03:16:47,030
As comfortable as you can right this

2159
03:16:47,030 --> 03:16:49,270
moment.

2160
03:16:49,270 --> 03:16:55,290
Allow yourself just be here and now

2161
03:16:55,290 --> 03:16:58,860
observing the words I share with you

2162
03:16:58,860 --> 03:17:04,100
like a soft breeze on a summer night.

2163
03:17:04,100 --> 03:17:05,940
Noticing whatever it is that you

2164
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:07,379
notice.

2165
03:17:07,379 --> 03:17:09,780
Your body may begin to relax more

2166
03:17:09,780 --> 03:17:11,139
and more. This is not fucking helping.

2167
03:17:11,139 --> 03:17:13,299
As you listen to my voice,

2168
03:17:13,299 --> 03:17:16,520
go deeper within. How would somebody be

2169
03:17:16,520 --> 03:17:17,879
able to sleep to this?

2170
03:17:17,879 --> 03:17:19,879
Could you imagine? All right, seriously,

2171
03:17:19,879 --> 03:17:21,079
wait a second.

2172
03:17:21,079 --> 03:17:23,799
Wait. Can you imagine if you were

2173
03:17:23,799 --> 03:17:25,399
trying to go to sleep?

2174
03:17:25,399 --> 03:17:27,959
Okay. You lay down and you're like, man,

2175
03:17:27,959 --> 03:17:29,239
I really wish I had something to help

2176
03:17:29,239 --> 03:17:30,440
me go to sleep. And I'm like, I only

2177
03:17:30,440 --> 03:17:31,479
help you there.

2178
03:17:31,479 --> 03:17:33,559
And I go right up to your fucking ear.

2179
03:17:33,559 --> 03:17:36,629
And I'm like, very soon you'll be

2180
03:17:36,629 --> 03:17:38,299
sleeping.

2181
03:17:38,299 --> 03:17:40,379
And just to let you know, it's so

2182
03:17:40,379 --> 03:17:42,299
relaxing in this room.

2183
03:17:42,299 --> 03:17:45,239
And very soon you'll be going to bed

2184
03:17:45,239 --> 03:17:46,840
just like the breeze of a sunny

2185
03:17:46,840 --> 03:17:48,600
summer Monday morning.

2186
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:50,680
That's the way that you'll see the

2187
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:52,600
world. Like, you're gonna be like, what

2188
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:53,479
the fuck? What are you doing to me?

2189
03:17:53,479 --> 03:17:55,159
Like, I'm trying to sleep. I need

2190
03:17:55,159 --> 03:17:57,079
complete silence. And I need nobody

2191
03:17:57,079 --> 03:17:57,719
talking.

2192
03:17:57,719 --> 03:18:01,670
And I don't want any lights on. All

2193
03:18:01,670 --> 03:18:03,110
right, let's see if we can... Now I'm

2194
03:18:03,110 --> 03:18:03,670
even more

2195
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:05,590
fucking on edge than I was before. It

2196
03:18:05,590 --> 03:18:10,659
didn't help. At all.

2197
03:18:10,659 --> 03:18:20,500
I just like burped. Where is my

2198
03:18:20,500 --> 03:18:25,399
meditation?

2199
03:18:25,399 --> 03:18:27,399
I just had it. Where is it? It's on a

2200
03:18:27,399 --> 03:18:29,319
different window. What the fuck is this

2201
03:18:29,319 --> 03:18:29,879
window?

2202
03:18:29,879 --> 03:18:33,860
Why is it down here? Help me! Come on!

2203
03:18:33,860 --> 03:18:38,340
Find its best way to let go naturally.

2204
03:18:38,340 --> 03:18:41,610
You don't need to relax. It may be that

2205
03:18:41,610 --> 03:18:44,649
your body needs to heal in other ways.

2206
03:18:44,649 --> 03:18:47,100
It's good to know that you're

2207
03:18:47,100 --> 03:18:48,700
unconscious.

2208
03:18:48,700 --> 03:18:52,569
Mine is an expert in healing and

2209
03:18:52,569 --> 03:18:54,170
balancing

2210
03:18:54,170 --> 03:18:59,299
in a safe and natural way while you

2211
03:18:59,299 --> 03:18:59,940
can just

2212
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:08,540
flow with the experience. Change

2213
03:19:08,540 --> 03:19:11,989
is a natural aspect of life. Like a

2214
03:19:11,989 --> 03:19:12,629
tree

2215
03:19:12,709 --> 03:19:16,469
Turn this shit off!

2216
03:19:16,469 --> 03:19:22,229
Stubborn! Let me fucking relax!

2217
03:19:22,229 --> 03:19:27,620
That guy just made me so fucking angry!

2218
03:19:27,620 --> 03:19:30,889
Imagine now that you're breathing in

2219
03:19:30,889 --> 03:19:32,969
that life energy.

2220
03:19:32,969 --> 03:19:50,920
Electrician found him like this. He

2221
03:19:50,920 --> 03:19:52,600
must have been taken here.

2222
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:54,120
Found cut marks around his wrists and

2223
03:19:54,120 --> 03:19:56,200
ankles. Death by strangulation.

2224
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:58,979
The killer gutted him post-mortem.

2225
03:19:58,979 --> 03:20:00,440
Thank God.

2226
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:02,680
Thank God. Anything else? Yeah seems

2227
03:20:02,680 --> 03:20:03,959
like the killer may have robbed him

2228
03:20:03,959 --> 03:20:06,459
on like previous victories.

2229
03:20:06,459 --> 03:20:10,899
Uh not victories. Couldn't find the

2230
03:20:10,899 --> 03:20:12,340
kid's wallet.

2231
03:20:12,340 --> 03:20:16,219
Who knows? Might have been someone else.

2232
03:20:16,219 --> 03:20:21,690
People have no morals these days.

2233
03:20:21,690 --> 03:20:23,610
Will have to run his prints. Fucking

2234
03:20:23,610 --> 03:20:25,129
god damn it. I'm on.

2235
03:20:25,129 --> 03:20:31,209
I'm off completely right now. I'm

2236
03:20:31,209 --> 03:20:32,250
gonna head back to the office. It's

2237
03:20:32,250 --> 03:20:33,450
been a rough night and I'm about to

2238
03:20:33,450 --> 03:20:35,930
get it. It's gonna get even harder.

2239
03:20:35,930 --> 03:20:37,209
This is ruining the game for me. I'm

2240
03:20:37,209 --> 03:20:38,090
too angry.

2241
03:20:38,090 --> 03:20:39,610
Just too hard. Oh it's gonna get so

2242
03:20:39,610 --> 03:20:40,809
much worse.

2243
03:20:40,809 --> 03:20:43,620
I'll let you know if you find anything

2244
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:50,649
else. All right. Why does that guy have

2245
03:20:50,649 --> 03:20:51,930
that move? Why does that guy die?

2246
03:20:51,930 --> 03:20:53,129
Why does that guy die in one hit? He

2247
03:20:53,129 --> 03:20:59,219
should die in one hit.

2248
03:20:59,219 --> 03:21:01,379
The same people who make this game.

2249
03:21:01,379 --> 03:21:15,479
This is a great song.

2250
03:21:15,479 --> 03:21:19,180
Chicken delivery. Hey guys just got

2251
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:22,069
the masks we ordered.

2252
03:21:22,069 --> 03:21:27,620
Pretty cool eh? They're all chickens.

2253
03:21:27,620 --> 03:21:28,739
Well how do they feel? You like

2254
03:21:28,739 --> 03:21:31,639
them?

2255
03:21:31,639 --> 03:21:35,540
Guys?

2256
03:21:48,260 --> 03:21:50,950
I think I just heard something. What are

2257
03:21:50,950 --> 03:21:54,020
you guys talking about?

2258
03:22:04,860 --> 03:22:10,180
I'll get it. Hey none of these phones

2259
03:22:10,180 --> 03:22:11,299
are ringing.

2260
03:22:11,299 --> 03:22:17,420
Sorry it's me. When did you get a

2261
03:22:17,420 --> 03:22:19,420
cell phone? I took it from that guy we

2262
03:22:19,420 --> 03:22:21,610
clocked at the bar.

2263
03:22:21,610 --> 03:22:22,889
Just charged it up this morning at

2264
03:22:22,889 --> 03:22:24,569
Dean's place. What should I do? Do I

2265
03:22:24,569 --> 03:22:25,370
answer?

2266
03:22:25,370 --> 03:22:27,770
I don't see any reason not to. All

2267
03:22:27,770 --> 03:22:29,860
right here goes nothing.

2268
03:22:29,860 --> 03:22:31,940
Hi it's me. I know you want it out

2269
03:22:31,940 --> 03:22:33,379
and I respect that but I just

2270
03:22:33,379 --> 03:22:34,659
figured I'd give you a call and see

2271
03:22:34,659 --> 03:22:35,780
if you've changed your mind.

2272
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:36,979
You wouldn't believe what's been going

2273
03:22:36,979 --> 03:22:43,620
on the last few weeks. That was just

2274
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:45,219
one of those outdoor frog sounds you

2275
03:22:45,219 --> 03:22:47,139
hear at night and in the fall.

2276
03:22:47,139 --> 03:22:48,500
We're calling the shots now. Top of

2277
03:22:48,500 --> 03:22:50,340
the game. No one can touch us.

2278
03:22:50,340 --> 03:22:51,620
The new product is in full scale

2279
03:22:51,620 --> 03:22:53,899
production. Get a new place.

2280
03:22:53,899 --> 03:22:56,059
Three floors up on northwest 20th

2281
03:22:56,059 --> 03:22:58,540
street. Who would have thought?

2282
03:22:58,540 --> 03:23:00,899
Why don't you swing on by and

2283
03:23:00,899 --> 03:23:03,299
check it out huh? Hello? Anyone there?

2284
03:23:03,299 --> 03:23:05,879
Click. Hey guys I think I just found

2285
03:23:05,879 --> 03:23:07,000
us something to do tonight.

2286
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:08,280
Let's go right now. I'll tell you

2287
03:23:08,280 --> 03:23:09,559
all about it in the van.

2288
03:23:09,559 --> 03:23:14,899
What's somebody saying? Somebody's

2289
03:23:14,899 --> 03:23:16,020
saying the hardest level in the game?

2290
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:18,020
Coming up. Best song in the game coming

2291
03:23:18,020 --> 03:23:28,979
up. Death wish. Can you open the door

2292
03:23:28,979 --> 03:23:30,260
already? It's getting pretty late.

2293
03:23:30,260 --> 03:23:32,420
They might be heading out soon. It was

2294
03:23:32,420 --> 03:23:34,020
your idea to stake the place out for

2295
03:23:34,020 --> 03:23:36,020
two hours. I'm working as fast as I

2296
03:23:36,020 --> 03:23:37,459
can.

2297
03:23:37,459 --> 03:23:38,899
Well we couldn't just barge in. You

2298
03:23:38,899 --> 03:23:40,340
gotta have a plan you know. At least

2299
03:23:40,340 --> 03:23:43,049
now we know where they are.

2300
03:23:43,049 --> 03:23:45,610
Dot dot dot. Just fucking open this

2301
03:23:45,610 --> 03:23:46,649
thing will ya?

2302
03:23:46,649 --> 03:23:48,170
Maybe you would like to take it over

2303
03:23:48,170 --> 03:23:50,409
then. I'm sure you'd get it open in

2304
03:23:50,409 --> 03:23:51,770
no use.

2305
03:23:51,770 --> 03:23:54,520
Yeah I didn't think so. I think I got

2306
03:23:54,520 --> 03:23:55,639
it now.

2307
03:23:56,409 --> 03:23:58,409
All right see you guys on the roof.

2308
03:23:58,409 --> 03:23:59,450
Don't forget to stay in touch with

2309
03:23:59,450 --> 03:24:01,049
the walkie talkies.

2310
03:24:01,049 --> 03:24:02,809
About the roof. You sure will be able

2311
03:24:02,809 --> 03:24:05,610
to jump across to the other building.

2312
03:24:05,610 --> 03:24:08,409
It looked a bit far to me. It's not

2313
03:24:08,409 --> 03:24:09,850
that far. Well at least not for the

2314
03:24:09,850 --> 03:24:11,959
rest of us.

2315
03:24:11,959 --> 03:24:13,879
Damn listen to this. You may have

2316
03:24:13,879 --> 03:24:15,239
some difficulties with it though

2317
03:24:15,239 --> 03:24:16,280
big guy.

2318
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:21,530
Yeah fuck you too. Restart it. I

2319
03:24:21,530 --> 03:24:22,489
didn't mean to do that.

2320
03:24:22,489 --> 03:24:32,950
See you on the roof. Let's go. Bingo.

2321
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:34,229
I'm ready. I don't know if this detail is

2322
03:24:34,229 --> 03:24:35,590
gonna be hard. I'm fucking putting my

2323
03:24:35,590 --> 03:24:36,950
game hands on.

2324
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:42,819
Hold on. There's one glove. You can't

2325
03:24:42,819 --> 03:24:44,020
tell because the slap

2326
03:24:44,020 --> 03:24:57,239
of the surgical glove. Okay that guy

2327
03:24:57,239 --> 03:25:39,579
wasn't not that guy was alive.

2328
03:25:39,579 --> 03:25:47,020
What the hell is this?

2329
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:52,729
I didn't do the cool thing. I just T

2330
03:25:52,729 --> 03:25:53,930
posed.

2331
03:25:53,930 --> 03:25:57,700
Jesus.

2332
03:25:57,700 --> 03:26:21,799
Who's left? Anybody else?

2333
03:26:21,799 --> 03:26:30,260
Okay two guys on that side. Nobody

2334
03:26:30,260 --> 03:26:31,459
left in this room so I'm safe to

2335
03:26:31,459 --> 03:26:32,659
stand here. So I've got a guy with a

2336
03:26:32,659 --> 03:26:35,139
melee. I'm gonna go top right.

2337
03:26:35,139 --> 03:26:38,090
If you aim down through here through

2338
03:26:38,090 --> 03:26:39,290
the window.

2339
03:26:39,290 --> 03:26:43,590
I don't think I can get him from here.

2340
03:26:43,590 --> 03:26:47,670
Shit. Oh god. The fucking windows.

2341
03:26:47,670 --> 03:27:12,459
Oh I'm so sick of the windows man.

2342
03:27:12,459 --> 03:27:21,319
Damn. I'm gonna try going down. Forget

2343
03:27:21,319 --> 03:27:22,200
about these guys right now. I'm gonna

2344
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:23,559
get these guys through the window.

2345
03:27:23,559 --> 03:27:34,040
All right give me another gun. I'm safe

2346
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:35,159
to go in here and shoot these guys

2347
03:27:35,159 --> 03:27:35,879
now.

2348
03:27:35,879 --> 03:27:37,079
But I'm gonna do it through the

2349
03:27:37,079 --> 03:27:52,809
window.

2350
03:27:52,809 --> 03:27:55,610
Oh come on Jeremy. Really? He's coming

2351
03:27:55,610 --> 03:27:56,489
down here.

2352
03:27:56,489 --> 03:28:00,040
Where is he? He's coming down here.

2353
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:19,959
Die. I'm done here. Ending upstairs.

2354
03:28:19,959 --> 03:28:28,940
Next part. Let's go. One two.

2355
03:28:28,940 --> 03:28:39,540
Didn't know you were up there. Look at

2356
03:28:39,540 --> 03:28:53,180
that gun. Two melee.

2357
03:28:53,180 --> 03:28:56,700
Holy fuck. Okay. Geez.

2358
03:28:56,700 --> 03:29:10,299
Um. I think it's gone. Window. Of

2359
03:29:10,299 --> 03:29:12,709
course.

2360
03:29:12,709 --> 03:29:22,149
Window. Of course. You got to be

2361
03:29:22,149 --> 03:29:26,180
kidding me sir.

2362
03:29:26,180 --> 03:29:30,819
My god. That instant. Bug like

2363
03:29:30,899 --> 03:29:35,850
reaction time. Where is this other dude?

2364
03:29:35,850 --> 03:29:43,030
Is he all the way up there?

2365
03:29:43,030 --> 03:29:45,530
No windows here. It's safe to go up

2366
03:29:45,530 --> 03:29:46,809
here.

2367
03:29:46,809 --> 03:29:49,049
I can see that they're all dead. No

2368
03:29:49,049 --> 03:29:51,340
windows.

2369
03:29:51,340 --> 03:29:55,049
Up and in. Nobody else alive. All right.

2370
03:29:55,049 --> 03:29:56,409
Give me new gun.

2371
03:29:56,409 --> 03:29:59,819
There's windows. What do I do? I'm

2372
03:29:59,819 --> 03:30:04,040
freezing. I'm panicking. I'm frozen.

2373
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:08,760
I'm frozen. What do I do? All right. I'm

2374
03:30:08,760 --> 03:30:10,120
gonna go back down.

2375
03:30:10,120 --> 03:30:15,659
This is it. Just this room and there's

2376
03:30:15,659 --> 03:30:17,399
a dog up here.

2377
03:30:17,399 --> 03:30:23,350
Get rid of that dog first. All right.

2378
03:30:23,350 --> 03:30:30,260
Only one way in this room.

2379
03:30:30,260 --> 03:30:32,899
You stupid game.

2380
03:30:32,899 --> 03:30:36,409
God damn it. Come on.

2381
03:30:36,409 --> 03:30:40,649
God man. Why did that happen?

2382
03:30:40,649 --> 03:30:44,389
Fucking hell. Shit. That was the end

2383
03:30:44,389 --> 03:30:44,950
too.

2384
03:30:44,950 --> 03:30:48,549
Come on. This is so hard. Those guys

2385
03:30:48,549 --> 03:30:50,309
can't be stopped.

2386
03:30:50,309 --> 03:30:55,639
Oh. I'm actually angry right now.

2387
03:30:55,639 --> 03:30:57,319
I was backpedaling but I got stuck

2388
03:30:57,319 --> 03:31:02,219
on a couch.

2389
03:31:02,219 --> 03:31:04,219
Those guys have to die. Those

2390
03:31:04,219 --> 03:31:05,500
people. You have to focus on those

2391
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:06,700
people.

2392
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:14,260
Because if those people...

2393
03:31:14,260 --> 03:31:17,700
Fuck me. I was so close too.

2394
03:31:17,700 --> 03:31:20,180
They just never stop running at you.

2395
03:31:20,180 --> 03:31:21,479
You have to shoot them with a

2396
03:31:21,479 --> 03:31:23,159
shotgun. I'm not gonna go in the

2397
03:31:23,159 --> 03:31:24,680
other room unless I have a shotgun.

2398
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:33,829
I promise you guys. Just the

2399
03:31:33,829 --> 03:31:34,549
slightest

2400
03:31:34,549 --> 03:31:38,389
little minuscule tiny teeny mistake

2401
03:31:38,389 --> 03:31:41,190
and the whole thing is over.

2402
03:31:41,190 --> 03:31:48,629
Oh. It's so stressful.

2403
03:31:48,629 --> 03:31:50,229
Absolutely no mistakes are allowed to be

2404
03:31:50,229 --> 03:31:51,670
made. Damn it.

2405
03:31:51,670 --> 03:32:05,340
I went in here first last time. All

2406
03:32:05,340 --> 03:32:10,409
right. Shotgun this dude.

2407
03:32:10,409 --> 03:32:11,850
Has to be a shotgun. I can't let

2408
03:32:11,850 --> 03:32:13,209
those guys just fucking chase me around

2409
03:32:13,209 --> 03:32:22,389
a room and not die.

2410
03:32:22,389 --> 03:32:24,709
There's a guy right fucking there.

2411
03:32:24,709 --> 03:32:27,979
Jesus.

2412
03:32:27,979 --> 03:32:37,139
That's not a knife. What? Is this not

2413
03:32:37,139 --> 03:32:38,180
a knife?

2414
03:32:38,180 --> 03:32:40,620
Have I lost my mind? That's not a

2415
03:32:40,620 --> 03:32:42,219
knife. What?

2416
03:32:42,219 --> 03:32:57,959
Let's try this again. I can't see that far.

2417
03:33:04,979 --> 03:33:10,870
God damn it.

2418
03:33:10,870 --> 03:33:14,549
Oh man. But is there somebody still up

2419
03:33:14,549 --> 03:33:15,989
there?

2420
03:33:15,989 --> 03:33:20,040
I can't see. Okay. No.

2421
03:33:20,040 --> 03:33:21,479
Okay. For the future if I die again

2422
03:33:21,479 --> 03:33:22,840
there's only one guy that's up

2423
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:23,719
there.

2424
03:33:23,719 --> 03:33:41,670
All right. Make sure I have a shotgun. I

2425
03:33:41,670 --> 03:33:46,299
believe that's it.

2426
03:33:46,299 --> 03:33:52,540
It's just that room now. All right. No.

2427
03:33:52,540 --> 03:33:53,579
No. No. There's a guy over there. It's

2428
03:33:53,579 --> 03:33:54,860
all right. Give me a shotgun. Is there a

2429
03:33:54,860 --> 03:33:56,139
shotgun?

2430
03:33:56,139 --> 03:33:58,780
Looking for a shotgun. There's it. Okay.

2431
03:33:58,780 --> 03:34:00,059
Here's one right here.

2432
03:34:00,059 --> 03:34:04,760
Plant it right in his head. Got it.

2433
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:05,719
Okay.

2434
03:34:05,719 --> 03:34:15,860
Now. Oh fuck. A guy's coming. Which way

2435
03:34:15,860 --> 03:34:16,659
is he going?

2436
03:34:16,659 --> 03:34:19,139
Holy shit. It's a dog. What? That guy

2437
03:34:19,139 --> 03:34:20,819
turned into a dog.

2438
03:34:20,819 --> 03:34:27,719
That guy turned into a dog.

2439
03:34:27,719 --> 03:34:38,100
Why? Where was the dog?

2440
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:43,340
Give me a break. How?

2441
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:45,420
Oh. Guy runs out of the room and all

2442
03:34:45,420 --> 03:34:47,579
of a sudden dog is running after me.

2443
03:34:47,579 --> 03:34:52,729
I can't even believe it. The guy was a

2444
03:34:52,729 --> 03:34:54,329
fucking werewolf.

2445
03:34:54,329 --> 03:35:13,059
Give me a fucking break, man. I can't even

2446
03:35:13,059 --> 03:35:14,340
fucking believe it.

2447
03:35:14,340 --> 03:35:29,180
That is un-fucking-believable. Got the

2448
03:35:29,180 --> 03:35:34,629
guy up there.

2449
03:35:34,629 --> 03:35:37,270
Where the fuck? Who are you guys?

2450
03:35:37,270 --> 03:35:49,219
I don't even... I didn't even know I had

2451
03:35:49,219 --> 03:35:50,899
the fucking role. I keep forgetting

2452
03:35:50,899 --> 03:35:56,729
that it's in this game.

2453
03:35:56,729 --> 03:35:57,850
And great. You got... you came out

2454
03:35:57,850 --> 03:35:59,450
this time. Nice. The one time you

2455
03:35:59,450 --> 03:36:01,209
ever opened that door.

2456
03:36:01,209 --> 03:36:09,719
The whole game is running after me

2457
03:36:09,719 --> 03:36:16,120
now. Anybody else like... running

2458
03:36:16,120 --> 03:36:18,040
after me?

2459
03:36:18,040 --> 03:36:24,819
Who the fuck was that guy? Who the

2460
03:36:24,819 --> 03:36:26,659
fuck was this guy?

2461
03:36:26,659 --> 03:36:30,139
What the hell was that? One of the guys

2462
03:36:30,139 --> 03:36:31,819
on the ground was not dead.

2463
03:36:31,819 --> 03:36:34,299
What the fuck just happened?

2464
03:36:34,299 --> 03:36:53,700
I'm losing it here. It's really only...

2465
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:54,819
There's one way I can do this. This is

2466
03:36:54,819 --> 03:36:56,260
the way I was doing it before.

2467
03:36:56,260 --> 03:37:29,180
And I'm so fucked. How are you

2468
03:37:29,180 --> 03:37:30,700
like reliably supposed to go in this

2469
03:37:30,700 --> 03:37:32,329
room?

2470
03:37:32,329 --> 03:37:33,770
Like isn't part of this game about

2471
03:37:33,770 --> 03:37:35,290
going really fast?

2472
03:37:35,290 --> 03:37:36,329
How would you ever do it in this

2473
03:37:36,329 --> 03:37:37,610
room?

2474
03:37:37,610 --> 03:37:39,209
It's just... you have to wait till

2475
03:37:39,209 --> 03:37:40,170
they get in a certain spot where you

2476
03:37:40,170 --> 03:37:41,930
can get them both, right?

2477
03:37:41,930 --> 03:37:45,850
Like dodge roll around them?

2478
03:37:45,850 --> 03:37:47,129
What are the iframes like in the

2479
03:37:47,129 --> 03:37:48,250
dog?

2480
03:37:48,250 --> 03:37:55,239
Okay, that's kind of a huge deal. I

2481
03:37:55,239 --> 03:37:56,920
didn't even know there were iframes.

2482
03:37:56,920 --> 03:38:07,530
Well, that changes a lot.

2483
03:38:07,530 --> 03:38:26,620
Ah, come on.

2484
03:38:26,620 --> 03:38:28,649
I gotta just focus on beating it.

2485
03:38:28,649 --> 03:38:29,850
I'm not gonna do dodge rolling

2486
03:38:29,850 --> 03:38:30,969
shit. Not now. It's way too late for

2487
03:38:30,969 --> 03:38:31,850
me to learn how to do that right

2488
03:38:31,850 --> 03:38:32,809
now.

2489
03:38:32,809 --> 03:38:53,500
All right, I need another gun. Try it

2490
03:38:53,500 --> 03:38:54,620
again.

2491
03:38:54,620 --> 03:39:03,340
Dodge rolling sucks in this game. I

2492
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:03,899
mean...

2493
03:39:03,899 --> 03:39:05,659
I don't know. I feel like it's going

2494
03:39:05,659 --> 03:39:07,260
to cause more problems if I try to use

2495
03:39:07,260 --> 03:39:13,639
it.

2496
03:39:13,639 --> 03:39:23,129
Did I kill the guy up here? Okay, I did.

2497
03:39:23,129 --> 03:39:27,350
One, two... this one guy right here.

2498
03:39:27,350 --> 03:39:32,889
Holy shit. Okay. A guy patrols in that

2499
03:39:32,889 --> 03:39:33,690
room.

2500
03:39:33,690 --> 03:39:37,879
So... that guy will kill me. Okay,

2501
03:39:37,879 --> 03:39:38,360
isn't that right?

2502
03:39:38,360 --> 03:39:46,549
Shoot him. Did I get him? I don't think

2503
03:39:46,549 --> 03:39:47,350
I did.

2504
03:39:47,350 --> 03:39:54,950
He's right there. Oh my fucking god.

2505
03:39:54,950 --> 03:39:57,110
A goddamn computer.

2506
03:39:57,110 --> 03:40:00,309
I shot the computer. I shot the

2507
03:40:00,309 --> 03:40:00,870
compu-

2508
03:40:00,870 --> 03:40:24,819
Calm down. I need a gun. Oh my fucking

2509
03:40:24,819 --> 03:40:26,979
god. Give me a break.

2510
03:40:26,979 --> 03:41:01,989
Kidding me. How did I not get the other

2511
03:41:01,989 --> 03:41:02,549
guy?

2512
03:41:02,549 --> 03:41:11,350
The worst part is not being able to

2513
03:41:11,350 --> 03:41:12,709
see down here. You know what I mean?

2514
03:41:12,709 --> 03:41:13,350
It's just like

2515
03:41:13,350 --> 03:41:17,239
taking a guess. When do I unlock the

2516
03:41:17,239 --> 03:41:18,520
guy with the mask that you can see

2517
03:41:18,520 --> 03:41:19,319
further?

2518
03:41:19,319 --> 03:41:37,020
A door. You don't get it in this

2519
03:41:37,020 --> 03:41:37,739
game.

2520
03:41:37,739 --> 03:41:48,139
Okay, there's a dog. I need a weapon.

2521
03:41:48,139 --> 03:41:56,340
Where's that dog?

2522
03:41:56,340 --> 03:42:00,260
I'm gonna get- I gotta find that

2523
03:42:00,260 --> 03:42:06,420
dog now. All right, he's in that room.

2524
03:42:06,420 --> 03:42:08,420
He's over here. He's sniffing me out.

2525
03:42:08,420 --> 03:42:10,500
This dog is sniffing me out right now.

2526
03:42:10,840 --> 03:42:14,500
He ha- I gotta get rid of him now. All

2527
03:42:14,500 --> 03:42:15,860
right, that was the one of the- I'm just

2528
03:42:15,860 --> 03:42:17,139
like bumping the microphone. I'm so

2529
03:42:17,139 --> 03:42:20,700
fucking on edge.

2530
03:42:20,700 --> 03:42:21,659
Don't know where the hell you came

2531
03:42:21,659 --> 03:42:24,819
from, but that's fine. All right, back

2532
03:42:24,819 --> 03:42:25,700
around.

2533
03:42:25,700 --> 03:42:44,069
Where's this guy? Where the fuck is he?

2534
03:42:44,069 --> 03:42:45,190
No, he's gonna come around this way,

2535
03:42:45,190 --> 03:42:46,700
isn't he?

2536
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:49,739
I don't know. I can't see. I can't

2537
03:42:49,739 --> 03:42:53,860
see where he is.

2538
03:42:53,860 --> 03:43:11,670
I'm like trapped right here. Dog.

2539
03:43:11,670 --> 03:43:18,299
I didn't even know you could- I

2540
03:43:18,299 --> 03:43:19,899
forgot you could go through that way.

2541
03:43:19,899 --> 03:43:26,629
All right, I'm almost done. Way to go.

2542
03:43:26,629 --> 03:43:33,909
Last guy. He's over there, and there's

2543
03:43:33,909 --> 03:43:35,909
nobody else, right?

2544
03:43:35,909 --> 03:43:37,270
I think that's it, and I'm pretty sure

2545
03:43:37,270 --> 03:43:39,459
I'm out of here after this.

2546
03:43:39,459 --> 03:43:50,260
No. Where's this fucking hidden person?

2547
03:43:50,260 --> 03:43:54,920
Oh, they're down there. Oh no!

2548
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:57,500
No, I'm so scared.

2549
03:43:57,500 --> 03:43:58,780
Give me a gun. I need to come with a

2550
03:43:58,780 --> 03:44:00,299
lot of bullets.

2551
03:44:00,299 --> 03:44:06,600
This'll do. Just two, but I have to

2552
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:08,600
go all the way around and down.

2553
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:09,799
But what if they see me? They're

2554
03:44:09,799 --> 03:44:11,559
gonna shoot me

2555
03:44:11,559 --> 03:44:12,920
from a hundred miles away, because I

2556
03:44:12,920 --> 03:44:14,840
can't see where they are.

2557
03:44:14,840 --> 03:44:37,610
You understand? Like, how the fuck- fucking

2558
03:44:37,610 --> 03:44:38,329
god,

2559
03:44:38,329 --> 03:44:41,540
get me out of here! I think I'm done

2560
03:44:41,540 --> 03:44:42,979
here. How are you guys doing?

2561
03:44:42,979 --> 03:44:46,100
There's more. There's another one.

2562
03:44:46,100 --> 03:44:47,700
There's a whole other floor. All right,

2563
03:44:47,700 --> 03:44:49,379
this is punch time.

2564
03:44:49,379 --> 03:44:53,159
Oh, okay, you can- all right. It's two

2565
03:44:53,159 --> 03:44:54,440
punches.

2566
03:44:54,440 --> 03:45:16,569
Well, you have a gun. Come on in. I'll

2567
03:45:16,569 --> 03:45:17,690
take you all.

2568
03:45:17,690 --> 03:45:20,170
Guy with a gun right there. All

2569
03:45:20,170 --> 03:45:21,610
right, he's at the window. Let me get

2570
03:45:21,610 --> 03:45:32,440
this guy first.

2571
03:45:32,440 --> 03:45:34,920
Okay, no guns, right? Only guy with

2572
03:45:34,920 --> 03:45:36,360
a gun is over there.

2573
03:45:36,440 --> 03:45:37,639
Window's here though. Where's the guy with

2574
03:45:37,639 --> 03:45:43,059
a gun? Up there. Oh, come on.

2575
03:45:43,059 --> 03:45:44,819
Out of line of sight, guys with guns

2576
03:45:44,819 --> 03:45:46,260
across the map.

2577
03:45:46,260 --> 03:46:09,299
It's starting to become tiring. How am

2578
03:46:09,299 --> 03:46:12,010
I gonna kill this guy?

2579
03:46:12,010 --> 03:46:16,340
Uh, how am I gonna kill this guy?

2580
03:46:16,340 --> 03:46:17,700
What the fuck are you supposed to do

2581
03:46:17,700 --> 03:46:19,459
about that guy? Punch up through the

2582
03:46:19,459 --> 03:46:35,850
window?

2583
03:46:35,850 --> 03:46:58,090
Oh my lord. I gotta get rid of this

2584
03:46:58,090 --> 03:46:59,049
guy.

2585
03:46:59,049 --> 03:47:01,260
Use the gun? I can't. This character

2586
03:47:01,260 --> 03:47:02,940
cannot use weapons.

2587
03:47:02,940 --> 03:47:15,129
Another guy with a gun. So that's

2588
03:47:15,129 --> 03:47:16,090
that.

2589
03:47:16,090 --> 03:47:30,299
Any more windows? Yep, plenty of them.

2590
03:47:30,299 --> 03:47:37,139
You're down knowing. Let me take a good

2591
03:47:37,139 --> 03:47:38,100
look at this. So

2592
03:47:38,100 --> 03:47:40,260
there's tons of people with guns.

2593
03:47:40,260 --> 03:47:43,770
There's only one way to get in here.

2594
03:47:43,770 --> 03:47:45,559
I have to go all the way down and

2595
03:47:45,559 --> 03:47:46,520
around. That's the only way I can get

2596
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:50,170
in there. So I have to go down here.

2597
03:47:50,170 --> 03:47:52,489
Okay, can I like, can I get them to

2598
03:47:52,489 --> 03:47:53,770
run this way?

2599
03:47:53,770 --> 03:47:59,379
I think so. I have to bait them.

2600
03:47:59,379 --> 03:48:01,690
This is gonna be a pain in the ass.

2601
03:48:01,690 --> 03:48:11,579
All right, one more guy with a gun.

2602
03:48:11,579 --> 03:48:13,579
Watch out for that dumb window.

2603
03:48:13,579 --> 03:48:22,569
Oh no, not a window! Am I safe if I run

2604
03:48:22,569 --> 03:48:28,229
up there? No, he's got a gun.

2605
03:48:28,229 --> 03:48:30,469
So if he, okay, if I walk over here and

2606
03:48:30,469 --> 03:48:32,149
these guys see me shoot through,

2607
03:48:32,149 --> 03:48:34,149
but if I run up to this room, this guy

2608
03:48:34,149 --> 03:48:35,430
will shoot me.

2609
03:48:35,430 --> 03:48:45,879
I wonder if I can bait them. Okay, I got

2610
03:48:45,879 --> 03:48:55,319
one.

2611
03:48:55,319 --> 03:48:58,200
Holy shit! Oh my god, my body just,

2612
03:48:58,200 --> 03:49:01,290
I, my whole body hurts. That hurt.

2613
03:49:01,290 --> 03:49:02,649
That actually hurt.

2614
03:49:02,649 --> 03:49:09,139
Okay, just this one guy, but I gotta

2615
03:49:09,139 --> 03:49:10,500
bait this guy because if I run up

2616
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:11,620
there, I gotta make sure he comes over

2617
03:49:11,620 --> 03:49:12,340
here. Come here.

2618
03:49:12,340 --> 03:49:18,149
All right, here we go. One punch. Last

2619
03:49:18,149 --> 03:49:18,870
guy.

2620
03:49:18,870 --> 03:49:37,829
No, this is not the last guy. Oh,

2621
03:49:37,829 --> 03:49:40,680
cheesing the level. How the hell are

2622
03:49:40,680 --> 03:49:41,799
you supposed to do this on your first

2623
03:49:41,799 --> 03:49:42,440
try?

2624
03:49:42,440 --> 03:49:44,280
I've never played in the game before.

2625
03:49:44,280 --> 03:49:45,319
How the fuck else are you supposed

2626
03:49:45,319 --> 03:50:07,799
to do this?

2627
03:50:07,799 --> 03:50:13,260
Oh damn, get me out of this. Go get

2628
03:50:13,260 --> 03:50:14,540
me out of here.

2629
03:50:14,540 --> 03:50:19,610
I think I heard something. All right,

2630
03:50:19,610 --> 03:50:21,049
fine, finally!

2631
03:50:21,049 --> 03:50:40,090
Can you get the door out of the way?

2632
03:50:40,090 --> 03:50:45,879
Why? Really?

2633
03:50:45,879 --> 03:50:49,959
You're like fucking hack accuracy.

2634
03:50:50,040 --> 03:51:12,549
That's great. Let's go.

2635
03:51:12,549 --> 03:51:26,120
Hmm. What the fuck, man? That's such

2636
03:51:26,120 --> 03:51:27,079
bullshit.

2637
03:51:27,079 --> 03:51:33,319
Honest to god. Oh, that's so infuriating.

2638
03:51:33,319 --> 03:52:12,020
How did he not get cut? Dude, I hate

2639
03:52:12,020 --> 03:52:13,059
the doors. The doors just make the

2640
03:52:13,059 --> 03:52:40,360
enemies fall down and make it harder to kill.

2641
03:52:40,360 --> 03:52:42,520
He's left. The whole second part of

2642
03:52:42,520 --> 03:52:43,239
the level.

2643
03:52:43,239 --> 03:52:48,020
We're, and I don't understand where

2644
03:52:48,020 --> 03:52:49,139
he even came from.

2645
03:52:49,139 --> 03:52:50,819
I just looked over there. I just

2646
03:52:50,819 --> 03:52:52,340
checked.

2647
03:52:52,340 --> 03:53:13,190
He's not even dead. I wish you could

2648
03:53:13,190 --> 03:53:14,329
just shoot him on the ground.

2649
03:53:14,329 --> 03:53:48,600
I really do. How did I not kill him?

2650
03:53:50,200 --> 03:53:55,209
Ah, somebody heard it. I'm dead. I'm so

2651
03:53:55,209 --> 03:53:58,739
dead.

2652
03:53:58,739 --> 03:54:00,739
Hold on, I pressed the razor button.

2653
03:54:00,739 --> 03:54:02,979
Sorry, I pressed it twice apparently.

2654
03:54:02,979 --> 03:54:12,260
Why waste bullets when you can hit

2655
03:54:12,260 --> 03:54:13,459
space and kill them for free? Because the

2656
03:54:13,459 --> 03:54:15,139
animation takes like six seconds to

2657
03:54:15,139 --> 03:54:20,549
kill them.

2658
03:54:20,549 --> 03:54:21,750
When I kill them but they're lying

2659
03:54:21,750 --> 03:54:22,870
on the ground and I press space on

2660
03:54:22,870 --> 03:54:23,989
them, they take, it's like a full

2661
03:54:23,989 --> 03:54:25,110
animation.

2662
03:54:25,110 --> 03:54:50,579
Okay, what's down there? Got any guns

2663
03:54:50,579 --> 03:54:51,540
down there?

2664
03:54:51,540 --> 03:55:09,620
Two guns. Uh, I'm going back up.

2665
03:55:09,959 --> 03:55:12,440
Because I think I got the dog on me.

2666
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:16,010
I think I'm coming all the way around

2667
03:55:16,010 --> 03:55:17,610
the whole game.

2668
03:55:17,610 --> 03:55:20,729
Goodness.

2669
03:55:34,760 --> 03:55:37,209
Actually, I want to, I'm gonna, let me

2670
03:55:37,209 --> 03:55:38,489
drag the whole fucking level over here.

2671
03:55:38,489 --> 03:55:39,770
Seriously. I'd rather just sit over

2672
03:55:39,770 --> 03:55:42,459
here.

2673
03:55:42,459 --> 03:55:44,379
It's so difficult to even get out

2674
03:55:44,379 --> 03:55:45,979
there and even take two steps

2675
03:55:45,979 --> 03:55:46,379
forward.

2676
03:55:46,379 --> 03:55:47,899
I mean, I just, I wish I could see

2677
03:55:47,899 --> 03:55:50,059
further. Like, ugh.

2678
03:55:50,059 --> 03:56:13,579
That's it. Here comes the dog. All the way

2679
03:56:13,579 --> 03:56:14,940
around the whole game. Come on, all the

2680
03:56:14,940 --> 03:56:16,860
way around. Come on, dog.

2681
03:56:16,860 --> 03:56:18,840
Start from here and make it all the

2682
03:56:18,840 --> 03:56:20,680
way over. You know exactly where I was.

2683
03:56:20,680 --> 03:56:29,879
You could smell me, right? See, my problem

2684
03:56:29,879 --> 03:56:30,760
is just,

2685
03:56:30,760 --> 03:56:32,760
I, walking down this hallway, I might

2686
03:56:32,760 --> 03:56:34,840
just fucking die instantly by the,

2687
03:56:34,840 --> 03:56:55,500
somebody that's over here.

2688
03:56:55,500 --> 03:57:30,819
Hotline Miami 2 in a nutshell?

2689
03:57:32,870 --> 03:57:36,069
Why? Oh my god.

2690
03:57:36,069 --> 03:57:47,399
Did that dog hear that? Bring him on

2691
03:57:47,399 --> 03:57:49,180
over here.

2692
03:57:49,180 --> 03:57:51,180
Oh no, hey, come on. Everyone, bring

2693
03:57:51,180 --> 03:58:01,639
the pets into French.

2694
03:58:01,639 --> 03:58:12,760
Oh, I can't even go over here.

2695
03:58:12,760 --> 03:58:14,120
Shoot? But I don't want to shoot because

2696
03:58:14,120 --> 03:58:15,399
I don't want to bring everybody else

2697
03:58:15,399 --> 03:58:21,129
over here right now.

2698
03:58:21,129 --> 03:58:29,399
Ah, here's the issue. Again, here's the

2699
03:58:29,399 --> 03:58:32,069
same issue from before.

2700
03:58:32,069 --> 03:58:33,909
Am I just gonna step out and die? I

2701
03:58:33,909 --> 03:58:38,969
don't know. I have to go this way.

2702
03:58:38,969 --> 03:58:40,090
There's no other way to go, so I

2703
03:58:40,090 --> 03:58:41,610
have to, I have to, like, sneak in

2704
03:58:41,610 --> 03:58:43,209
this room and not die. Go.

2705
03:58:43,209 --> 03:58:58,309
There's a guy right there, okay. Here

2706
03:58:58,309 --> 03:59:00,069
comes the two guys with the guns.

2707
03:59:00,069 --> 03:59:01,819
I don't want to shoot here because

2708
03:59:01,819 --> 03:59:03,420
it'll pull everybody and it'll be a

2709
03:59:03,420 --> 03:59:04,459
mess.

2710
03:59:04,459 --> 03:59:16,090
I can't see. Did they move? Here they

2711
03:59:16,090 --> 03:59:17,530
are. I'm gonna follow them.

2712
03:59:21,819 --> 03:59:23,420
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

2713
03:59:23,420 --> 03:59:25,180
Holy shit, I just turned and clicked and

2714
03:59:25,180 --> 03:59:35,750
spam clicked.

2715
03:59:35,750 --> 03:59:46,469
Fuck, man. This is so ridiculous.

2716
03:59:46,469 --> 03:59:47,590
I know I could do it a different way,

2717
03:59:47,590 --> 03:59:48,709
but I don't care.

2718
03:59:48,709 --> 03:59:50,309
How did he not shoot me? Why did you

2719
03:59:50,309 --> 03:59:52,149
not shoot me? Why, thank God, why did

2720
03:59:52,149 --> 03:59:59,450
you not shoot me?

2721
03:59:59,450 --> 04:00:08,489
But, oh no.

2722
04:00:08,489 --> 04:00:11,290
He fucking was behind him. Oh man, I

2723
04:00:11,290 --> 04:00:12,729
would classify this game

2724
04:00:12,729 --> 04:00:16,469
as extreme difficulty.

2725
04:00:16,469 --> 04:00:18,309
I've played Dark Souls, I've played

2726
04:00:18,309 --> 04:00:20,389
Demon's Souls, I've played them all.

2727
04:00:20,389 --> 04:00:21,750
I would put this one into the category

2728
04:00:21,750 --> 04:00:26,260
of, like, holy fuck difficulty.

2729
04:00:26,260 --> 04:00:29,139
This is extreme. This is extreme

2730
04:00:29,139 --> 04:00:32,659
difficulty.

2731
04:00:32,659 --> 04:00:34,819
And there's a hard mode, holy shit. How

2732
04:00:34,819 --> 04:00:36,180
do you even play that one?

2733
04:00:36,180 --> 04:00:48,120
How do you even do that? I can't

2734
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:49,559
believe there's a hard difficulty here.

2735
04:00:49,559 --> 04:00:50,920
How the hell, how does that even work?

2736
04:00:50,920 --> 04:00:52,600
You die in one hit anyways.

2737
04:00:52,600 --> 04:01:18,569
I fucking panicked. How do you make

2738
04:01:18,569 --> 04:01:24,500
this game harder? You add enemies?

2739
04:01:24,500 --> 04:01:26,729
What's the hard mode? Guns have

2740
04:01:26,729 --> 04:01:27,930
half as many bullets and there's more

2741
04:01:27,930 --> 04:01:37,959
enemies.

2742
04:01:37,959 --> 04:01:44,809
They're coming. I saw them. Oh, how did

2743
04:01:44,809 --> 04:01:59,020
that not cut through them both?

2744
04:02:06,780 --> 04:02:29,940
Oh my God, oh my God.

2745
04:02:29,940 --> 04:02:36,420
You have to be a corner creeper in this

2746
04:02:36,420 --> 04:02:37,379
game. Did you have to do that in the

2747
04:02:37,379 --> 04:02:38,819
last one? You didn't do this in the

2748
04:02:38,819 --> 04:02:40,420
last game. You didn't have to, like,

2749
04:02:40,420 --> 04:02:41,780
shoot a wall and bait a hundred

2750
04:02:41,780 --> 04:02:42,899
enemies that have guns.

2751
04:02:42,899 --> 04:02:44,340
I don't remember that happening in

2752
04:02:44,340 --> 04:02:45,780
the last one. I just played it two

2753
04:02:45,780 --> 04:02:46,579
days ago.

2754
04:02:46,579 --> 04:03:19,739
Oh fuck.

2755
04:03:29,110 --> 04:03:32,649
There's a dog. Come on up here, dog. Come

2756
04:03:32,649 --> 04:03:33,370
on.

2757
04:03:33,370 --> 04:03:48,760
Just a guy with a bat. Jesus Christ.

2758
04:03:48,760 --> 04:03:57,340
Okay, I don't, I need, I need another

2759
04:03:57,340 --> 04:03:58,620
bullet. I need another gun. Give me

2760
04:03:58,620 --> 04:03:59,579
that gun.

2761
04:03:59,579 --> 04:04:26,420
This is, that was a mistake. What are you

2762
04:04:26,420 --> 04:04:27,940
doing over there? Get over here.

2763
04:04:27,940 --> 04:04:35,100
He's not hearing that? Why are you

2764
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:39,639
not hearing this?

2765
04:04:39,639 --> 04:05:07,739
Uh, oh, just shoot.

2766
04:05:07,819 --> 04:05:18,389
My goodness. To the roof. We're on the

2767
04:05:18,389 --> 04:05:20,389
roof. How are things going for you guys?

2768
04:05:20,389 --> 04:05:23,750
Hello? Is anyone there? Guys?

2769
04:05:23,750 --> 04:05:27,430
They're not answering. Maybe your walkie

2770
04:05:27,430 --> 04:05:31,450
talkie's busted.

2771
04:05:31,450 --> 04:05:32,489
I don't think so. It seems to be

2772
04:05:32,489 --> 04:05:34,819
working just fine. Should we go back

2773
04:05:34,819 --> 04:05:37,899
and check on them?

2774
04:05:37,899 --> 04:05:40,940
Mmm.

2775
04:05:52,250 --> 04:06:05,770
What the fuck are you waiting for?

2776
04:06:05,770 --> 04:06:06,969
Wait, do I not have access to those

2777
04:06:06,969 --> 04:06:07,930
two characters? They have, like,

2778
04:06:07,930 --> 04:06:09,530
my favorite characters in the game.

2779
04:06:09,530 --> 04:06:14,540
I'm not gonna get D. C.

2780
04:06:14,540 --> 04:06:15,979
Why is it always the level, the levels

2781
04:06:15,979 --> 04:06:17,340
that take me 40 minutes and make me

2782
04:06:17,340 --> 04:06:18,540
the most angry.

2783
04:06:18,540 --> 04:06:22,629
I get Cs on them. Hey, but to be fair,

2784
04:06:22,629 --> 04:06:23,590
let me give myself a little bit of

2785
04:06:23,590 --> 04:06:24,950
credit here.

2786
04:06:24,950 --> 04:06:26,870
40 minutes is the cap, man. That's

2787
04:06:26,870 --> 04:06:28,709
like the hard cap before I hit my

2788
04:06:28,709 --> 04:06:32,059
enrage timer. Don't you understand?

2789
04:06:32,059 --> 04:06:41,930
And then it's just, I beat it. Hey,

2790
04:06:41,930 --> 04:06:42,889
you're not supposed to be here. We've

2791
04:06:42,889 --> 04:06:51,000
got this under control. Sure looks

2792
04:06:51,000 --> 04:06:53,959
like it. I'll take over from here.

2793
04:06:53,959 --> 04:07:06,940
You can't do that. Just watch me.

2794
04:07:07,020 --> 04:07:08,700
That level was the pinwheel of Hotline

2795
04:07:08,700 --> 04:07:10,620
Miami 2. That's bullshit,

2796
04:07:10,620 --> 04:07:15,510
and you all know it. It's fucking hard

2797
04:07:15,510 --> 04:07:19,450
when the game is, the game is,

2798
04:07:19,450 --> 04:07:22,170
start quote, tough as nails, top-down

2799
04:07:22,170 --> 04:07:24,170
shooter that will really test your

2800
04:07:24,170 --> 04:07:28,729
patience, end quote. What do we have

2801
04:07:28,729 --> 04:07:29,770
here? We're in mass. Another set of

2802
04:07:29,770 --> 04:07:32,170
vigilantes, I presume.

2803
04:07:32,170 --> 04:07:33,450
Don't shoot. I give up. I'm through

2804
04:07:33,450 --> 04:07:35,819
with this. Just arrest me and get this

2805
04:07:35,819 --> 04:07:36,940
over with, okay?

2806
04:07:36,940 --> 04:07:43,899
I'm done fighting. Oh, you want your

2807
04:07:43,899 --> 04:07:45,180
15 minutes of fame? Well, I don't

2808
04:07:45,180 --> 04:07:49,270
think so.

2809
04:07:49,270 --> 04:07:50,469
You know what happens to thugs like

2810
04:07:50,469 --> 04:07:53,559
you?

2811
04:07:55,670 --> 04:08:02,729
That's what happens. Are you all right,

2812
04:08:02,729 --> 04:08:06,489
sir? What happened in there?

2813
04:08:06,489 --> 04:08:07,930
He came at me, had to take him out. It

2814
04:08:07,930 --> 04:08:14,700
was him or me. Not even true.

2815
04:08:14,700 --> 04:08:19,989
Looks like my job here is done. I'll

2816
04:08:19,989 --> 04:08:21,510
leave the rest up to you.

2817
04:08:21,510 --> 04:08:35,700
Okay, bye. That's it? That's it,

2818
04:08:35,700 --> 04:08:39,739
apparently, okay.

2819
04:08:39,739 --> 04:08:55,139
Fourth act, falling. So all the

2820
04:08:55,139 --> 04:08:56,100
animals are gone.

2821
04:08:56,100 --> 04:09:00,819
Good morning, honey. I didn't want to

2822
04:09:00,819 --> 04:09:02,739
wake you. Took Jimmy to school, left

2823
04:09:02,739 --> 04:09:04,340
you some breakfast. See you tonight. Love

2824
04:09:04,340 --> 04:09:05,299
Sharon.

2825
04:09:05,299 --> 04:09:17,399
Okay. I'm having trouble

2826
04:09:17,399 --> 04:09:19,659
following the story here.

2827
04:09:19,659 --> 04:09:22,219
We have like a Kingdom Hearts level of

2828
04:09:22,219 --> 04:09:27,540
shit going on.

2829
04:09:27,540 --> 04:09:30,920
Hey, mister. Spare some change?

2830
04:09:30,920 --> 04:09:35,209
Sure, here you go.

2831
04:09:35,209 --> 04:09:38,139
Boy, look like I want your dirty

2832
04:09:38,139 --> 04:09:39,559
money.

2833
04:09:39,559 --> 04:09:42,040
Excuse me? We barely got enough money

2834
04:09:42,040 --> 04:09:43,319
for rent.

2835
04:09:43,319 --> 04:09:44,760
Maybe you should stop trying to be a

2836
04:09:44,760 --> 04:09:48,440
writer. We've got kids to feed.

2837
04:09:48,440 --> 04:09:51,239
We need a real job, dear. This just

2838
04:09:51,239 --> 04:09:52,600
isn't working.

2839
04:09:52,600 --> 04:09:55,620
Sharon, what's going on here? I'll

2840
04:09:55,620 --> 04:09:56,899
leave you. I'll take the kids and

2841
04:09:56,899 --> 04:09:57,540
leave.

2842
04:09:57,620 --> 04:09:59,299
You won't have to do that. This book,

2843
04:09:59,299 --> 04:10:01,219
it's gonna be good, I promise. I need

2844
04:10:01,219 --> 04:10:02,739
more time.

2845
04:10:02,739 --> 04:10:05,350
Time is the one thing you don't have.

2846
04:10:05,350 --> 04:10:06,549
Maybe you should reconsider your

2847
04:10:06,549 --> 04:10:08,860
priorities.

2848
04:10:08,860 --> 04:10:11,860
What are you saying? I said I don't

2849
04:10:11,860 --> 04:10:21,020
want your stinking money.

2850
04:10:21,020 --> 04:10:29,559
Organization 13!

2851
04:10:29,559 --> 04:10:30,840
Oh, I thought we were still on the

2852
04:10:30,840 --> 04:10:32,280
subway. What?

2853
04:10:32,280 --> 04:10:38,389
Well, this is one of those missions

2854
04:10:38,389 --> 04:10:41,219
where I can't kill anybody.

2855
04:10:41,219 --> 04:10:56,569
It's one of those guns. Guns.

2856
04:10:56,569 --> 04:10:58,489
And why would you stop there? Why did

2857
04:10:58,489 --> 04:11:00,250
you stop there? You saw where I went.

2858
04:11:00,250 --> 04:11:42,250
Why would you freeze there?

2859
04:11:42,250 --> 04:11:58,659
Where did you even come from?

2860
04:11:58,659 --> 04:12:00,979
The Green Goblin. That's fine. You can call

2861
04:12:00,979 --> 04:12:02,420
me whatever you want.

2862
04:12:02,420 --> 04:12:04,940
But what the hell? I'm trying to get

2863
04:12:04,940 --> 04:12:05,899
this guy to

2864
04:12:05,899 --> 04:12:08,620
fade over to me. And he just won't do

2865
04:12:08,620 --> 04:12:09,500
it.

2866
04:12:09,500 --> 04:12:34,020
He just won't do it. Guy with a gun?

2867
04:12:34,020 --> 04:12:36,409
Oh, fucking guy with a gun!

2868
04:12:36,409 --> 04:12:52,489
There's another guy right here

2869
04:12:52,489 --> 04:12:54,889
coming over. Come on. I got stuck on

2870
04:12:54,889 --> 04:13:01,959
fucking wall.

2871
04:13:01,959 --> 04:13:05,430
Kill the guys on the ground. I

2872
04:13:05,430 --> 04:13:06,870
thought I'm not supposed to do that.

2873
04:13:06,870 --> 04:13:09,370
Wasn't I specifically not supposed to

2874
04:13:09,370 --> 04:13:16,920
do that?

2875
04:13:16,920 --> 04:13:18,520
Yeah, what are you trying to bait me

2876
04:13:18,520 --> 04:13:19,479
into doing something that I'm not

2877
04:13:19,479 --> 04:13:23,030
supposed to do?

2878
04:13:23,030 --> 04:13:33,450
Really? Don't let yourself succumb to

2879
04:13:33,450 --> 04:13:34,649
the hate. I'm not.

2880
04:13:34,649 --> 04:13:42,059
I'm all right. I can't walk through

2881
04:13:42,059 --> 04:13:42,940
this?

2882
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:45,180
Oh, there's a very- you have to go

2883
04:13:45,180 --> 04:13:51,879
the right way. I get it.

2884
04:13:51,879 --> 04:13:57,559
Windows. Oh god. All right. This guy's-

2885
04:13:57,559 --> 04:13:58,760
everybody pretty much has a gun in

2886
04:13:58,760 --> 04:13:59,719
that room.

2887
04:13:59,719 --> 04:14:01,479
So if I'm going to bait people, it

2888
04:14:01,479 --> 04:14:02,680
needs to be

2889
04:14:02,680 --> 04:14:10,139
these guys up here. Maybe not. What's

2890
04:14:10,139 --> 04:14:11,180
down here?

2891
04:14:11,180 --> 04:14:12,860
Nothing. All right. There's a safe spot

2892
04:14:12,860 --> 04:14:13,979
over here.

2893
04:14:13,979 --> 04:14:22,020
All right. What about- is there any that-

2894
04:14:22,020 --> 04:14:23,860
they can come through there?

2895
04:14:23,860 --> 04:14:35,639
They're already aiming over here. What's

2896
04:14:35,639 --> 04:14:37,639
up here?

2897
04:14:37,639 --> 04:14:42,120
Aye aye aye. Aye aye aye.

2898
04:14:42,120 --> 04:14:43,719
Give me a break. I did it too and

2899
04:14:43,719 --> 04:14:44,840
I clicked it and I

2900
04:14:44,840 --> 04:14:53,420
fucking clicked it. What happened there?

2901
04:14:53,420 --> 04:14:54,700
What happened there twice?

2902
04:14:54,700 --> 04:14:58,459
Two times. Twice. Two. Two times.

2903
04:14:58,459 --> 04:15:22,389
All right, there's three guys. Where's this other guy going?

2904
04:15:22,389 --> 04:15:44,979
i don't want to go through the turnstile now he can see me from there

2912
04:18:13,799 --> 04:18:19,159
child i don't know how he got mixed up in that mess i'm sure it must have come as a

2913
04:18:19,159 --> 04:18:23,079
shock to you yes well i noticed that he was behaving differently he was always a bit of a

2914
04:18:23,079 --> 04:18:27,159
loner you see suddenly he was going out to meet old friends i never knew he had any

2915
04:18:27,719 --> 04:18:30,440
i didn't think much of it a man that age shouldn't be alone all the time

2916
04:18:31,180 --> 04:18:34,540
i always felt i was holding him back he was taking care of me you see

2917
04:18:35,340 --> 04:18:39,239
did he tell you anything about what happened i only visited him a couple of times when he

2918
04:18:39,239 --> 04:18:43,799
was in prison he wouldn't tell me a thing about it said it was better if i didn't know

2919

what we told you what i'm playing the game okay how dare you focus on the video game you

3081
04:52:01,689 --> 04:52:25,369
should be looking over here what he's not gonna talk is he well i don't want like spoilers

3082
04:52:25,369 --> 04:52:28,970
like hey by the way don't die on the third floor because it ruins the rest of the

3083
04:52:28,970 --> 04:52:32,389
game and it is a cutscene you're gonna miss i don't want to know that i mean i

3084
04:52:32,389 --> 04:53:01,099
just lost whatever i'm not gonna talk got any last words asshole that's it isn't that the

3085
04:53:01,099 --> 04:53:14,090
equivalent of like just telling me spoilers for the game because if i do know that then i'm gonna

3086
04:53:14,090 --> 04:53:17,610
hope i would like play differently i probably would still have lost so you didn't is not like a

3087
04:53:17,610 --> 04:53:34,740
i probably still would have lost don't die game ruined well it wasn't don't die it was

3088
04:53:34,740 --> 04:53:39,299
apparently specifically don't die on the third floor don't die on the third floor do not die

3089
04:53:39,299 --> 04:53:44,259
on the third floor it's like why why not oh okay something will happen if i if i don't

3090
04:53:44,259 --> 04:54:10,119

how the hell are the four of us gonna capture a power plant they should be sending

3095
04:54:43,799 --> 04:54:48,889
in a whole platoon the place is likely booby trapped too risky for a whole platoon

3096
04:54:50,099 --> 04:55:01,110
i guess we're more expendable do you see this can you see my face this is my true nature

3097
04:55:01,669 --> 04:55:07,029
you see don't you this is who i am this is who we all are we're animals there's no denying it a

3098
04:55:07,029 --> 04:55:11,430
bunch of goddamn animals they're sending us up to slaughter or be slaughtered and here we sit

3099
04:55:11,430 --> 04:55:16,150
until they tell us what to do and how to do it no will of our own just mindless obedience

3100
04:55:16,150 --> 04:55:19,750
we don't even know why we're fighting now do we only knows that the deep down somewhere

3101
04:55:19,750 --> 04:55:22,310
in there we just enjoy destruction and violence it's just part of our nature

3102
04:55:23,909 --> 04:55:36,259

all right where's the gun shotgun oh i fucking missed and that was the one right there

3375
05:56:38,340 --> 05:56:49,560
i don't understand why well it's not picking the shotgun up the weapon priority

3376
05:56:49,560 --> 05:56:52,840
it just doesn't matter it's just it's just random it's a random number between one and

3377
05:56:52,840 --> 05:57:17,689
fucking 12 damn it man in a world where it's it's so hard to like actually

3378
05:57:18,490 --> 05:57:22,490
i've run over the gun like three times and try to pick it up it just picks up another

3379
05:57:22,490 --> 05:57:58,860
item what in the name of fucking god does it keep doing that for why rush the guy with the

3380
05:57:58,860 --> 05:58:42,069
gun he has a he has a gun it's fucking locked onto him too and i can't understand why it

3381
05:58:42,069 --> 05:59:09,340
continues i'm trying to press d and s at the same fucking time what am i locked onto of course

3382
05:59:09,979 --> 05:59:19,340
where are you going you gotta be close enough to throw it at him but it's an open fucking

3383
05:59:19,340 --> 05:59:26,659
area it's just open everybody can just look at you i gotta be close enough to throw this at him

3384
05:59:27,220 --> 05:59:57,930
and then just run to him okay what kind of level is this by the way what is this like

3385
05:59:57,930 --> 06:00:03,290
level design it's just a giant fucking all it what there's no level here where are we

3386
06:00:03,290 --> 06:00:15,799
oh we're on a roof what is this why these people where the couches where the tvs

3387
06:00:16,439 --> 06:00:56,540

3388
06:00:56,540 --> 06:01:02,889
just like go i have to go like this just move in fucking erratic patterns no it doesn't matter

3389
06:01:05,020 --> 06:01:09,740
kill three melee and wait but i have to be close enough to throw the thing at him

3390
06:01:11,990 --> 06:01:16,709
if once i get to a point where i'm close enough to throw it at him i'm just dead every time

3391
06:01:22,040 --> 06:01:25,819
it didn't even it didn't even matter that time there are other doors i can't use the other

3392
06:01:25,819 --> 06:01:47,860
doors look they cannot be used i can't go over there and get it it was no there's only

3393

3394
06:02:07,619 --> 06:02:17,740
bullshit how did i fuck it up because i couldn't pick up the gun the first time

3395
06:02:22,119 --> 06:02:25,720
it's very easy when you run over and press the pickup the only thing that exists it's all it's

3396
06:02:25,720 --> 06:02:48,169
pick up weapon on ground stop locking on and throwing it well what how else do i make sure

3397
06:02:48,169 --> 06:03:36,630
i could like get it on him and sometimes he just runs over here no fuck he's got that like

3398
06:03:36,630 --> 06:03:39,909
bodyguard with him to try to like ambush him around the corner it's like you run into the

3399
06:03:39,909 --> 06:03:48,599
fat guy and the fat guy just punches you why did this game turn into like hitman go by the way

3400

3410
06:08:21,139 --> 06:08:29,099
because bad yeah sure sure i wonder what your first playthrough looked like that's where let's

3411
06:08:29,099 --> 06:08:34,380
let's let's see your video of you playing the first time huh i think you did a thousand

3412
06:08:34,380 --> 06:09:00,919
fucking times all right back up hey i beat it already what's your excuse i'm my monitor don't

3413
06:09:00,919 --> 06:09:17,509
that's not funny the like monitor falling backwards is not like a thing i want to do

3414
06:09:17,509 --> 06:09:47,619
tonight all right where's that there's a dog did the dog is dead and the guys just rushed

3415
06:09:47,619 --> 06:09:52,259
it and what why do the other guys don't come in i don't get it why do these guys all don't

3416
06:09:52,259 --> 06:10:17,849
run in just the guy these people heard that somehow turn the brightness up give me that

3417
06:10:17,849 --> 06:10:38,520
gun same deal all right now give me something better than this the shotgun is all right i don't

3418
06:10:38,520 --> 06:10:44,819
the shotgun i'm not a fan of the shotgun i mean look at how many guns are just pointed at this

3419
06:10:44,819 --> 06:10:54,740
door it might be better off just going around here but it's gonna it's gonna pull everybody

3420
06:10:59,139 --> 06:11:09,990
i'm gonna have to know but as these guys will shoot me too i really don't i don't know i

3421
06:11:09,990 --> 06:11:20,549
think it's just kind of pick them off from here all right there's only a couple left

3422
06:11:28,299 --> 06:11:31,500
question is when i shoot this guy i think i'm gonna go through here

3423
06:11:34,860 --> 06:11:37,500
give me a break i fucking can't believe that didn't kill them all

3424
06:11:39,060 --> 06:11:53,849
god damn it it's just so many reflexes in a second time just takes like a quarter of a second

3425
06:11:53,849 --> 06:12:13,060
he's dead and stuck on the fucking wall use fists when they rush you when they are all

3426
06:12:13,060 --> 06:12:25,740
shooting guns at you you would use fists you want to use fists when they when the seven or

3427
06:12:25,740 --> 06:12:44,709
eight people with a shotgun you punch much faster they're rushing through the door you

3428
06:12:44,790 --> 06:12:58,069
instead of shooting just punch um how how much is actually left in the game

3429
06:12:58,069 --> 06:13:05,099
before i literally strangled myself but how many more levels are there do you think how many are

3430
06:13:05,099 --> 06:13:31,740
there like six the six more chapters to this game you're on the first level i dropped it

3431
06:13:33,299 --> 06:13:38,299
i can't i couldn't see where it was on the ground rage quit well is it a rage quit if

3432
06:13:38,299 --> 06:13:45,060
the game is like 10 hours long and six hours of this is like mind melting you can't you

3433
06:13:45,060 --> 06:13:59,860
don't have to be the whole thing in one sitting they heard that i gotta get i'm turning the camera

3434
06:14:00,819 --> 06:14:26,220
i gotta go camels yeah i'm losing it it actually might actually i think i might

3435
06:14:26,220 --> 06:14:47,590
have to take a break build a gun where's the fat guy go my lord take a blip break and play

3436
06:14:47,590 --> 06:15:28,680
katamari damacy no if i take a break i'm not playing this game again tonight dog he's did he

3437
06:15:28,680 --> 06:15:33,880
actually see me through the fucking door is there a gun all right that gotta be dead let

3438
06:15:33,959 --> 06:15:45,349
me i'm gonna try it let me a few more times this is the nightmare scenario that this that's this

3439
06:15:45,349 --> 06:15:48,950
room and then you got to punch my fucking right weapon at the problem shoot shoot shoot it's just

3440
06:15:48,950 --> 06:16:02,680
blah i this is a silenced gun though okay there goes that guy once somebody shoots here it's

3441
06:16:02,680 --> 06:16:13,270
over let me what's down here no i'll get i'll get caught up in there i gotta go this way i

3442
06:16:13,270 --> 06:16:30,869
think oh fuck all right it's okay there's only one guy with a gun here but that door is

3443
06:16:30,869 --> 06:16:41,540
open now i only have three bullets before everyone's gonna hear me i gotta make these count

3444
06:16:46,520 --> 06:16:53,080
all right one more shot i want to get the guy with the gun oh fuck that guy that guy came in

3445
06:16:53,080 --> 06:17:05,349
the room that guy's got a gun i should be able to get rid of him nobody else in there right

3446
06:17:05,349 --> 06:17:30,229
that's it i think he can see right he can jesus no oh man oh man oh man fucking hell

3447
06:17:38,409 --> 06:17:48,659
wow okay you know how if you go to the playstation trophies menu thing and you go to like how many

3448
06:17:48,659 --> 06:17:54,569
people got to like the cleric beast and bloodborne i wonder what that looks like for this game

3449
06:17:56,389 --> 06:18:26,979
seriously claret yeah claret beast is the first boss i just i need like a shotgun and i'm just

3450
06:18:26,979 --> 06:18:33,020
gonna bring them in here and see if i can just clear it out i feel like that's been a shit

3451
06:18:33,020 --> 06:18:37,509
load of this game though am i crazier to think that oh let me just like go like this

3452
06:18:37,590 --> 06:18:45,560
and bring everybody in here i is that like you know what i mean shoot and then they just sit here

3453
06:19:00,169 --> 06:19:31,180
this seems to be the strat for this game okay i i guess i mean i eventually i'm gonna do this

3454
06:19:31,180 --> 06:19:54,259
i don't know i'm gonna pull everybody over here all right this big guy don't just stoop

3455
06:19:54,259 --> 06:19:59,639
don't just shoot i missed him all right i got one fucking bullet make it count and i hit the

3456
06:19:59,639 --> 06:20:22,659
fucking door god damn it man and hit the fucking door like give me a break that's unbelievable

3457
06:20:37,619 --> 06:20:41,380
that's the strategy most people use and complain about but take it from someone who's done s

3458
06:20:41,380 --> 06:20:46,970
rank on every level that's not how you do it well if most people do it like this isn't that

3459
06:20:46,970 --> 06:20:53,450
potentially a problem with the game itself you know i mean if like most people do it

3460
06:20:53,450 --> 06:21:01,430
like this isn't that kind of like a shouldn't it not be like that i don't remember doing

3461
06:21:01,430 --> 06:21:10,340
this i do not remember doing this type of shit in the first game this game's a lot of

3462
06:21:10,340 --> 06:21:14,740
fun i'm like having i'm having a good time i think the game's like a very fun it's fun to

3463
06:21:14,740 --> 06:21:30,599
like run around rooms grab grab what's next but like shooting a wall so people run into the

3464
06:21:30,599 --> 06:21:57,500
room i mean like what the heck is that fuck i didn't have i gotta stop picking up the

3465
06:21:57,500 --> 06:22:43,939
shotgun damn it i want to at least get to the end of this level i feel like i'll do

3466
06:22:43,939 --> 06:23:11,220
it eventually no again i did it again i wish i would didn't drop the gun when i do that how

3467
06:23:11,220 --> 06:23:32,580
good why am i doing that try this again all right i mean that room is clear nobody in this

3468
06:23:32,580 --> 06:24:08,389
one this is the guy up here i gotta be careful big guy two big guys left nobody in that up top

3469

3494
06:28:42,180 --> 06:28:47,400
too hard it's pretty straightforward you'll know when you see it just put your suit on

3495
06:28:48,119 --> 06:29:14,169
click 682 deaths house call right through the window actually if i'm quick enough

3496
06:29:15,689 --> 06:29:34,950
oh plenty plenty of windows i'm thinking through this door over on the right this whole thing is

3497
06:29:34,950 --> 06:29:50,819
a window that we got there's a guy with a gun down here gun lots of guns not really safe

3498
06:29:50,819 --> 06:30:22,020
anywhere huh is this covered i don't think it is whoops a daisy is this cover no no i'm done

3499
06:30:22,580 --> 06:30:39,770
i just want to see what this level was about the door is covered though i fold them so i got

3500
06:30:39,770 --> 06:30:48,619
a gun hold on all right like the video game what the hell was that what was going on in that

3501
06:30:48,619 --> 06:31:07,770
video game there watch out for the window although i can do it too but not a good idea

3502
06:31:08,409 --> 06:31:38,860
does that guy have a gun no okay machine gun machine gun can get in this room over here

3503
06:31:38,860 --> 06:31:46,500
let's get it i thought that was gonna bump into him but apparently not empty give me

3504
06:31:46,500 --> 06:31:55,299
another gun all right we got one two i might be able to knock this guy out that's risky

3505
06:31:55,299 --> 06:32:20,979
just shoot him okay got it oh i couldn't do that oops wow okay wow i gotta get that out of his hand

3506
06:32:20,979 --> 06:32:33,779
right now give me the give it oh i fucking threw it whoops fuck no i don't want to get on top

3507
06:32:33,779 --> 06:32:53,779
of them okay i figured it out i gotta get the gun i gotta um god damn i think it was a big

3508
06:32:53,779 --> 06:33:01,220
guy no shit okay i know i know what i gotta do just gotta be careful big guy comes out

3509
06:33:01,220 --> 06:33:18,619
shoot him with a shotgun where did the guy with the gun come from okay watch it for that

3510
06:33:18,619 --> 06:33:36,759
guy with the gun i don't think i have any bolts damn what do i do about this guy thought i hit

3511
06:33:36,759 --> 06:33:57,610
him with the what's over on the left i wish i could see i could throw it up there but i don't

3512
06:33:57,610 --> 06:34:01,979
know if that's a good idea because if i run in there somebody could probably shoot me from up

3513
06:34:01,979 --> 06:34:20,889
here damn it and then it doesn't even matter damn it where did you come from whoa okay i

3514
06:34:20,889 --> 06:34:28,360

3515
06:34:28,360 --> 06:34:38,409
shoot this guy once i got it i got it okay that guy in there is gone but what's all the okay that's

3516
06:34:38,409 --> 06:34:51,909
the end of the level gun gun gun i don't think nobody has a gun that guy has a gun

3517
06:34:54,150 --> 06:35:09,180
that guy does have a gun doesn't he no more guns just this guy no there's a gun up there

3518
06:35:09,180 --> 06:35:27,669
okay i got it i actually fucking yeah i shot the guy back there okay it's just a bunch

3519
06:35:27,669 --> 06:35:35,880

3520
06:35:36,119 --> 06:35:40,950

3527
06:37:19,750 --> 06:37:22,630
getting it to that point where i'm starting to feel it i know we're getting it's getting

3528
06:37:22,630 --> 06:37:33,340
really late it's like 2 a.m eastern right now let's see if i let's see if i transcend

3529
06:37:33,340 --> 06:37:39,299
okay i'm gonna give myself like 10 attempts to transcend and then i'm gonna i'm gonna call it

3530
06:37:39,860 --> 06:37:52,569
because i don't know how much longer my brain can think 10 is so few all right 20 i'm back

3531
06:37:53,880 --> 06:37:57,479
so i'm in there just waiting for the trial to start and i can tell you time moves slow when

3532
06:37:57,479 --> 06:38:09,500
you're locked up this one day i get a visit that's one of these good afternoon who are you

3533
06:38:10,139 --> 06:38:19,180
i told you he wouldn't recognize us why are you here tying up some blue sense just a

3534
06:38:19,180 --> 06:38:23,900
little precaution seems like it wasn't really necessary i'm afraid i don't understand oh we

3535
06:38:23,900 --> 06:38:32,069
didn't expect you to while we're here we might as well say our goodbyes goodbyes yes after all

3536
06:38:32,069 --> 06:38:42,900
you served us well but it looks like your time's up now do i recognize them um you figured out

3537
06:38:42,900 --> 06:38:53,560
i'm sure it was nice seeing you again but i'm afraid it's time for us to leave is it the

3538
06:38:53,560 --> 06:39:32,470
janitor you take care 20th scene release the hell say your prayers asshole no no no no wait

3539

3540
06:39:45,529 --> 06:40:21,700
i'm just gonna oh my lord oh what was that fucking hitbox survive you must transcend

3541
06:40:23,430 --> 06:40:46,310

3542
06:40:47,419 --> 06:41:05,849
okay what oh boy so i just have to escape i just have to escape right

3543
06:41:06,490 --> 06:42:08,099
everybody the gun all right i think i think i'm at my boiling point i think i've reached the

3544
06:42:08,099 --> 06:42:33,060
point where i'm done for tonight holy fuck we made a lot of progress yeah i i don't know if

3545
06:42:33,060 --> 06:42:45,500
i can handle this one right now this isn't even the worst room why jesus what the hell

3546
06:42:46,459 --> 06:43:07,259
fuck who's left up there okay i'm safe to go down here i can get into the gun i got stuck

3547
06:43:07,259 --> 06:43:14,919
it's all right i'm fine all right oh they can shoot through the window fuck god the window

3548
06:43:14,919 --> 06:43:23,180
oh my lord now this is it it's the last try but streaming this game again it's like what an

3549
06:43:23,180 --> 06:43:52,659
hour or two left of the whole game just all right let me ask you this is this the like

3550
06:43:52,659 --> 06:44:02,759
hardest part of this part of the game just it's the six more all right yeah then i'll do it

3551
06:44:02,759 --> 06:44:16,310
another night before i actually fucking go crazy all right now's the time as any

3552
06:44:22,599 --> 06:44:33,060
transcendence delayed when are you gonna do it again um so the plan here yeah i gotta i gotta

3553
06:44:33,060 --> 06:44:53,740
stop unfortunately it really is too much for my brain right now it's about seven hours

3554
06:44:54,380 --> 06:44:59,819
or i might even you know like it might i might even just do no it's like 11 30

3555
06:45:00,380 --> 06:45:07,909
that's it's time to go so let me go with the plan so i'm not going to be streaming

3556
06:45:08,950 --> 06:45:18,020
tomorrow or tuesday because monday and tuesday here i want to set up completely hopefully

3557
06:45:18,740 --> 06:45:25,880
their work days to get the christmas stream ready to go so i will not see you guys until

3558
06:45:25,880 --> 06:45:33,750
wednesday and we will just probably we'll probably just come back to this and try to

3559
06:45:33,750 --> 06:45:46,220
finish it 739 deaths i can't even that's a number i can't count to and depending on

3560
06:45:46,220 --> 06:45:51,419
how long that takes us and depending on where that goes can you die one more time yeah that's

3561
06:45:51,419 --> 06:46:20,569
okay that was way more than one all right that's gonna be it thanks everybody for coming out

3562
06:46:27,930 --> 06:46:32,970
getting addicted yeah it's getting really really late this time to go i had a lot of fun i

3563
06:46:32,970 --> 06:46:39,180
did the game's a great game but if you want my honest true opinion i think hotline may

3564
06:46:39,180 --> 06:46:47,799
be one is like a more fun game it's almost it feels like hotline miami 1 was a lot of fun

3565
06:46:47,799 --> 06:46:52,540
and it was hard but then they made hotline miami 2 and they were just like hey let's let's just

3566
06:46:52,540 --> 06:47:01,240
make it even more ridiculous because i i loved hotline miami 1 that was like a fun great

3567
06:47:01,240 --> 06:47:05,479
experience i it was frustrating sometimes but i feel like some of the levels in this game

3568
06:47:05,479 --> 06:47:14,740
were just like designed to just make you hate yourself it's still really fun though like

3569
06:47:14,819 --> 06:47:24,889
you see i kind of can't stop playing it and if you like more of a extreme kind of challenge if

3570
06:47:24,889 --> 06:47:33,849
you like more challenge than one then absolutely i think they're both great games i think they're

3571
06:47:33,849 --> 06:47:52,020
definitely both worth playing for sure but yeah that's my opinion on it i think i'm definitely

3572
06:47:52,020 --> 06:48:03,540
going to finish it and i definitely would give it a recommend but yeah uh let's do the oh we

3573
06:48:03,540 --> 06:48:10,970
got a lot of bits holy shit there's there there's like a there's a lot of you guys

whether and there's nobody in the room with you you're just like talking you just say you're

just venting frustrations they might not even be based in reality you know what i mean and

3710
07:04:28,810 --> 07:04:31,849

3711
07:04:38,099 --> 07:04:43,340
i do like get concerned sometimes because when when i play a game like this and it's very very

3712
07:04:43,340 --> 07:04:49,340
difficult and it did a lot of timing and you got a very precise aim and it's very hard

3713
07:04:49,979 --> 07:04:54,619
i always get scared and kind of sad that maybe people will take the things that i'm saying

3714
07:04:55,419 --> 07:04:58,619
and i say like oh this is fucking stupid this game sucks you know what i mean but like it's

3715
07:04:58,619 --> 07:05:02,939
not real it you know i really just don't want people to think that like oh this game is

3716
07:05:02,939 --> 07:05:09,369
stupid because it's not you know what i mean i really hope i don't come across that way but

3717
07:05:09,369 --> 07:05:15,060

take care and good night ps please do more face cam bits i think i can speak for what

3748
07:10:43,189 --> 07:10:50,869
for chat when i say that we adore it thank you and yeah that's that's why i may have decided

3749
07:10:50,869 --> 07:10:57,590
to keep playing because i'm just sucked into it but it i i am on the other side of the

3750
07:10:57,590 --> 07:11:03,319
universe right for everybody it's almost 3 a.m i never went this late back when i was streaming

3751
07:11:03,319 --> 07:11:14,119
in massachusetts so but yeah i'm looking forward to it too i hope you enjoy the christmas

3752
07:11:17,220 --> 07:11:29,000
i sincerely do it should be fun uh thank you to oh hold on let me get it right drosophila

3753
07:11:32,970 --> 07:11:38,860
see got it thanks for the one dollar i hope this game doesn't ruin your perception of the

3754
07:11:38,860 --> 07:11:43,819
series i really disliked hotline 2 but hotline 1 is still a great game and i go back to it

3755
07:11:43,819 --> 07:11:48,459
frequently 2 is a disappointment because of all the open corridors windows and out of sight

3756
07:11:48,459 --> 07:11:54,060
enemies as well as your inability to choose your mask but you can always replay 1 hashtag

3757
07:11:54,060 --> 07:12:05,180
charity thank you yeah i mean i've i set my piece on the two games it kind of just feels

3758
07:12:05,180 --> 07:12:15,159
like they tried to dial two up like like really like all the way and i mean it's just

3759
07:12:15,720 --> 07:12:23,049
a challenge for people and that's you know that's the way it is you could choose the mask uh

3760
07:12:23,049 --> 07:12:28,330
only in a couple of missions i think there really was only about two or three missions

3761
07:12:28,330 --> 07:12:39,849
so far and i've been up there's only two masks i even had the whole time but yeah i feel

3762
07:12:39,849 --> 07:12:47,430
like that opinion is not like an unpopular one though to say that i don't know how split is like

3763
07:12:47,430 --> 07:12:54,009
the hotline miami community people that like love these games it does kind of feel like i

3764
07:12:54,009 --> 07:13:15,939
love people like two more i love two for the story not the gameplay it's pretty split i love

3765
07:13:15,939 --> 07:13:19,299
two but it's more frustrating just still split there's a split it seems it's a good game

3766
07:13:19,299 --> 07:13:22,259
but the first one yeah it seems like there's a lot of people that like it that's why

3767
07:13:23,220 --> 07:13:37,349
you know it's they're both good games i personally i think i enjoyed one more if one had like a few

3768
07:13:37,349 --> 07:13:44,250
more levels then i would probably put it if it's just there's so much more in two it seems like

3769
07:13:44,250 --> 07:13:57,529
at this point but i'm not sure but almost done thank you to graveyard ghoul for the

3770
07:13:57,529 --> 07:14:10,659
one dollar inaccurate depiction of germa after six hours of hotline miami more doesn't always

3789
07:16:12,680 --> 07:16:22,500
third of my whole life and it becomes a part of you know who you are so i don't know if there's

3791
07:16:30,700 --> 07:16:34,939
you liked the content you're a fan and you it was something that you watched all the time

3792
07:16:34,939 --> 07:16:40,979
it's not like it's just entertainment it's it's something for you to unwind with and

3793
07:16:40,979 --> 07:16:46,490
it's like when a when a tv show is done it is oh it's the final season of uh

3794
07:16:47,610 --> 07:16:53,500
seinfeld that was like sad for a lot of people because it was just like oh wow that

ghoul champ thanks for the three dollars hard mode adds harder enemies in place of others faster

3808
07:18:35,689 --> 07:18:39,610
enemies reversed levels less doors more windows and your ammo is cut in half every time you

3809
07:18:39,610 --> 07:18:49,540
pick up a weapon it's really messed up damn i don't even know i don't even know how you

3810
07:18:49,540 --> 07:19:01,319
would do that it's like that's so much the game already is a lot and adding that on top

3811
07:19:01,319 --> 07:19:11,979
of it all the windows and the more enemies faster people oh but thank you for the three

3812

dollars thank you timmy tim tan for the one dollar didn't you say something about sort of a solo

3813
07:19:14,860 --> 07:19:23,209
podcast type thing a while back is that still something you want to do yes 2019 is going

3814
07:19:23,209 --> 07:19:29,430
to be when i start to implement some of the things that i would like to try i wanted to

3815
07:19:29,430 --> 07:19:38,340
give myself at least a few months to settle here and i mean i've already done something

3816
07:19:38,340 --> 07:19:44,389
you know in a studio or a new thing and i'm doing it again but i mean it's not like that

3817
07:19:44,389 --> 07:19:49,979
those streams and some of those ideas haven't happened yet but i think i wanted to give

3818
07:19:49,979 --> 07:19:59,130
myself a little bit time but that's definitely something you'll probably be seeing in 2019 not

3819
07:19:59,130 --> 07:20:07,880
really like a podcast but i don't know i have a few things that i'd like to try we'll see 2019

3820
07:20:07,880 --> 07:20:10,759

3822
07:20:18,630 --> 07:20:23,509

3824

souls games are just so interesting speed run a speed ran dark souls is just cool it's fun
