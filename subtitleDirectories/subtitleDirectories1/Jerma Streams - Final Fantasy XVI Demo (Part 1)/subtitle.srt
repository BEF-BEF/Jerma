1
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:29,320
All right, I am back. I need to go this way. Grab this. How are you? You guys ready?

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,020
Final Fantasy 16. We're gonna watch a trailer. I think this is a live action trailer. This was

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:45,780
uploaded yesterday. Let me just tweet my tweet. Hey, there's a new sponsor tweet incoming. New

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:01:04,629
sponsor tweet. Are you serious? Okay. Wait, hold on. What is this one? Hotel fridges are just

5
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,269
freezers. Don't fuck around. That sandwich you put in there. Is it going to turn into a Jimmy

6
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:23,299
Dean's breakfast sandwich? That's pretty good. I'm just looking at my drafts right now. That's

7
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:34,620
actually a pretty good one. He's always dry. He's dumping the drafts right now. No, these,

8
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:45,590
no, they're not drunk tweets. Oh, this one's actually for, I will go over this after the sponsor.

9
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:59,189
Because this one, I got, I got a story to tell you after this. All right. Let me tweet this. Make

10
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,250
sure it looks right. You tell me if it looks good on Twitter. Look at how active my Twitter

11
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:13,879
is today. You've seen this activity. This is two, this is two or three tweets in one day. Look at

12
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,860
me now. Look at what I'm doing. Look at me. Look at what I'm doing now. Actually using Twitter.

13
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:42,969
Look at me. Okay. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. I'm just somebody shut up.

14
00:02:46,229 --> 00:03:05,460
Everything work the 34 seconds ago. Shut up. Hi. Okay. All right. Let's watch the trailer. This is

15
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:14,259
the final fantasy 16 Requiem live action trim. Actually, I've not seen this. So let's see the

16
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:26,969
music off. Let's get comfortable. Let's get this. I'm going to turn the lights off. Everything seems

17
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:42,629
pretty solid. Uh, oh, there we go. I had to quit the game. Speak up. This is not it. I was still

18
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:57,770
in the other game. Get out of this. All right. It is time to watch the final fantasy 16 live

19
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:07,509
action trailer. Thank you by the way, Square Enix and final fantasy 16, sponsoring the segment of

20
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:28,569
the stream. You ready? I wonder how this, I wonder how this is. Here we go. Oh my God. Violence, blood,

21
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:39,430
sexual themes, nudity, strong language. All right. Okay. Are you guys ready to watch? Make

22
00:04:39,430 --> 00:05:27,899
sure the audio is in a good spot. Here we go. Dog. Of course you walked by the blacksmith.

23
00:05:27,899 --> 00:07:22,740
Everybody's playing music. Okay.

24
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:31,449
Shit. Oh my God. He went flying. He flew in there. There it was. Final fantasy 16. I've got a PS5

25
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:44,570
right now. Very excited. You ready to check out the demo? Let's fucking go. All right.

26
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,149
Bear with me for a second. I've never used a PlayStation. Hope I did all this right.

27
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,299
I've never used a PlayStation 5. I've played it one time with italics because he showed me that

28
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:17,289
the trigger buttons are cool. All right. Let's go see if I did this right. I think I did. Can

29
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:35,029
you guys hear it? Wait, it's coming through my TV. Hold on. I got to fix this. All right.

30
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,789
Give me one second. It's coming through my TV. It's not coming through my headphones.

31
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:49,080
Can you hear this, the music? It's like playing the intro. All right. Hold on. I got to move this.

32
00:09:50,340 --> 00:10:18,950
Why is it going through my TV? There we go. Now I can hear it. Noise? What do you mean worse noise?

33
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:44,700
All right. Here we go. It's time. Square Enix. I do have to do this though. All right. Progress

34
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,500
is saved automatically. This demo features several chapters of Final Fantasy 16's first act. All

35
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,409
saved progress can be carried over to the main game. We hope you enjoy your time in Valisthia.

36
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:01,429
That's actually pretty good. That's cool. I'm glad you can actually save your progress.

37
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:09,269
Also, if you don't know, Final Fantasy 16, you don't need to know 15 games worth of story.

38
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:16,789
I think that's pretty obvious at this point. Otherwise, I don't know if I would have wanted

39
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:24,440
to play every single story for Final Fantasy, with the exception of a few, is different. This

40
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,019
one is no different. All right. Subtitles are going to stay on. Vibrations are going to keep

41
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:40,889
it on. What about brightness? Does this look good? A bit more? What do you guys think? I think it's

42
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:46,059
good right where it was. Game performance. Graphics or frame rate? I don't know. I don't

43
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:53,700
know really what this means. I have a PS5. Should I do graphics or frame rate? Maybe graphics.

44
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:08,330
Frame rate? This is probably fine. Story focused or action focused? Gameplay focused does not affect

45
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,330
story content. Mode can be changed after starting game. All right. So we're doing action, of course.

46
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:24,039
Screen brightness five. This is all sounds pretty good. Subtitles are on. Okay.

47
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:41,529
Is blessed in the light of the mother crystals and that it was this light

48
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,860
which finally led our forebears out of the darkness. Creative business unit. Great. What

49
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:59,080
they saw in the light gave rise to temptation. Temptation that ever lures us back into the

50
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,919
crystal shadow. And thus did our journey begin. Oh, that final fantasy. That final fantasy

51
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:53,740
soundtrack is already bumping. What just happened? Fireball? Wait, I have to evade. I'm playing the

52
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:16,549
game now. Spam fireball. Evade. Did I do it? Yeah, there's bird mode. I think I have to time it.

53
00:14:17,190 --> 00:15:02,740
There it is. PS5 looks pretty good. It's a three year old console. Yeah, I mean,

54
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:38,580
I have never seen it before. Year of the realm 873 nicer. So what? What character am I? Do I

55
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:52,500
choose one or am I? You all know the target. She was dominant and only the dominant. No one else.

56
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:02,490
Where's the fun in that? That's me, right? The girl will be among them. Our kind do not question

57
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:18,299
orders. We follow them. Try to keep that in mind. Let's get this done. Yeah, I can't wait. I hope

58
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:44,620
that makes an appearance. True. Yeah, true. Yeah. So from my understanding, this game is different

59
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:58,330
than the other ones. It's not turn based. It's like action based, right? I'm very curious what

60
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:13,579
that means. Focus Wyvern. You are key to this mission success. Okay. Yes, sir. Final fantasy

61
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:31,480
hasn't been turned based in like a decade. I said focus Wyvern. All right. Fly. Wait, the main menu.

62
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,799
Press whatever that button is at any time outside a cut scene to open the main menu.

63
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,089
Gameplay configuration settings, including camera inversion can also be adjusted on the system tab.

64
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:47,450
We don't have time for this. All hell is about to break loose. I want to look at the scenery.

65
00:17:48,089 --> 00:18:16,539
It's pretty good. Is there a run? All right. Tilt gently to walk. Here we go. Jump faster if you do

66
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:32,730
this. We're just in time. Do it gently. Do we have to fight all that? Look in army frontline.

67
00:18:36,619 --> 00:19:20,460
Turn it up. Am I going to fight in a big fucking battle? Turn it up now. Now it's too quiet.

68
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:31,430
They won't need this new dominant of theirs. I can't wait to go.

69
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:56,339
Stronghold. What do you mean you refuse? We refuse. Did you not pledge your swords for our cause?

70
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:05,930
Oh, new characters. Come now, Marshal. The king of Walud is our guest.

71
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:31,529
And you have his majesty's answer. Oh, damn it. There's a huge ass table.

72
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:53,740
You can't do much at a table like that. What was that? I wonder that you summoned us at all.

73
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:05,000
Cigarette stream. Vape. It was the Dalmex who drove back the crusaders in the Battle of the Twin

74
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:19,450
Realms, was it not? Or am I mistaken? Besides, your dominant has yet to take the field.

75
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,130
And when he does, our knights would only get in the way.

76
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Perhaps you have not heard, but the Ironblood now have their own dominant.

77
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,680
We would be fools to underestimate them. Bugger their knights. What did you say?

78
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,069
Oh, yeah. Should this citadel be allowed to fall?

79
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,859
Holy shit, this guy's fucking huge. The capital will lie exposed. He's like eight people. I,

80
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:55,940
okay, I did not know how big this guy was. The crusaders will wait for the good king's

81
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:14,140
pawns to line up before taking to the board. Why? Which just leaves me. That's so rude.

82
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:25,220
The Ironblood will rule the day they set foot on Storm. This game is over.

83
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:45,299
All right, so who's ass do I have to kick? You cock.

84
00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:05,720
Benedict. Take care. Does the lion take care when he chases the hare?

85
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:14,809
Or do you think me one of the latter? No, my love. You are a lion. You're my lion.

86
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,569
I'm not afraid of a little frost, Benedicta. This guy is so, he's just...

87
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:41,960
Do I have to kick, do I have to kick that guy's ass? The front lines are gone.

88
00:23:41,960 --> 00:24:17,430
18 plus and smoking. All right, cool. Okay, what's the first thing I got? You gotta give me like a

89
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:25,859
skeleton to kill, right? One skeleton is going to be like... Clive, be careful. That skeleton will

90
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:44,309
take you down in one swing. There's always a singular skeleton. As always, take the van.

91
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:56,380
Everyone we talked about what it would sound like if I had everyone, if I could hear everybody on

92
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:13,779
the stream. Okay, look at what it sounds like. Well, not like that. Oh shit. What was that?

93
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:23,579
There's the one skeleton. Oh no, that's quite the one skeleton for the tutorial.

94
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:44,730
All right, it's, I turned it up. So it's going to be loud. We're enjoying it. Just be aware. The

95
00:25:44,809 --> 00:26:07,799
volume, you should adjust your volume. I turned it up. Oh, wait, are those chocobos?

96
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,329
I thought he was making that sound with his mouth. I think he was.

97
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:41,589
Let's go. Move. Oh, God. Wait, is this a, is that person bad? Okay, I think that person's bad.

98
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,910
Who's on, what team am I on? I don't know what team I'm on. Am I on team ice or team big gigantic

99
00:27:49,910 --> 00:28:03,609
guy? It's hard to tell. Okay. All right. I'm liking this more and more as we go.

100
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:40,470
That's what I would say in that situation. Oh, a hundred percent. I'm glad that they're,

101
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:46,069
they're doing that instead of being like, Oh, whoa, better look out. No, you'd be like, fuck,

102
00:28:46,390 --> 00:29:03,779
please help me. Please. God help me. What the, Oh, that guy got crushed. Oh, that's not good.

103
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:32,420
Wyvern, I told you before you do not get to die here. That's pretty awful. Oh,

104
00:29:51,900 --> 00:30:10,099
now we're probably going to see some 13 summers earlier. There's always work for you in the

105
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:15,460
stables. Unless of course you think you can defend your master while sat on your ass in a puddle of

106
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:21,619
pigs. Well, I'm sure he'd find a way. My brother always looks after me. Right.

107
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:37,299
Go on. You're sure to hit him eventually. Don't give up now. I was going to say it's definitely

108
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:53,190
a wooden sword. All right. Wooden sword training. Here we go. All right. Start again from the

109
00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:03,589
beginning. Show me your form. Attack the Lord commander. So square to perform melee attack

110
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:11,000
up to four attacks can be chained together. So don't don't don't don't. Okay. There is a lock on

111
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:28,200
again. Is there a dodge roll? Very good. Such swordsmanship will serve you well in the field,

112
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,119
but can the same be said of your spell craft? The flames of the phoenix burn within you.

113
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:42,119
Now let them burn without. You're an eye frame crackhead. Green fire down upon me.

114
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:51,640
Yeah, I kind of am. Okay. Triangle to cast fire. A range spell that can strike enemies from great

115
00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:13,450
distances. Okay. I wonder if you can be like a mage. Well done. You wield the firebird's flames

116
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:20,250
just as a first shield should. You flatter me, my lord. Or would you rather I flattened you?

117
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:27,289
It can be arranged. Let's see if you can elude my blade. Plus one foe letter grade incoming.

118
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:31,369
Your attacking prowess will count for naught if you don't live long enough to use it.

119
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:43,130
On your toes, Lord Rossfield. Hmm. Stay quick on your feet. Evade four times. R1 to evade an

120
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:49,130
enemy's attack. Evading an attack at the precise moment it is dealt will temporarily slow the enemy,

121
00:32:49,130 --> 00:33:00,869
making it more susceptible to a counter. All right. Cool. Come on. Dodge that. Because I'm a gamer.

122
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:19,660
Nice try. Good. Remember, Clive, your blade is not your only weapon.

123
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:26,539
Use your thought and flitness of foot are indispensable arms in any shield. Use your

124
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,980
voice and your intelligence to get out of issues. Show me what sets you apart from the rest.

125
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,059
You have been blessed by the phoenix. Granted the use of its power. Call upon that power now

126
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:52,579
to close on me. Well, I'm waiting. Close the gap. The blessing of the phoenix grants Clive

127
00:33:52,579 --> 00:34:00,490
the ability to perform feats of inhuman strength and dexterity. Phoenix Shift is one such iconic

128
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:08,519
feat. Press circle to swiftly close in on a distant target. Both melee and ranged attacks

129
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:29,190
can be used while executing a phoenix shift. So it's like a super dodge. Impressive. But even

130
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,929
the most agile shield cannot hope to escape every blow. And death may come by a handful of cuts as

131
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,630
easily as it comes by a thousand. There is only one way to ensure that you do not fall.

132
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:51,179
Give your wounds mended and your energies replenished. Okay. Speaking of which, my lord,

133
00:34:51,739 --> 00:35:00,840
you seem a little worse for wear. Now that won't do at all. Healing menu I'm imagining use potions.

134
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,269
Consumable items such as potions and tonics can be used to restore Clive's HP or temporarily

135
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:15,500
boost attributes. Consumables can be assigned to up right down via the items tab in the main menu

136
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,099
for a quick and convenient use. These items can be also used directly from the menu. Okay. So I'm

137
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:31,019
imagining this probably I'm just trying not to burp it. I'm trying to keep it in. Okay. So you can

138
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:39,400
assign stuff but I already have potion. There it is. You can really spam it too. Okay. That's better.

139
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,829
Battle is a succession of pivotal moments where in life and death can be decided at a single

140
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:55,670
stroke funny voice every tool at your disposal. If you are to navigate can be both to victory

141
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:04,780
or at the very least to ensure that you live to fight another day. Enough practice. It's time for

142
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,980
the test. I'm going to stop this guy. You recovered from your soaking I trust.

143
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:15,820
You wouldn't want to kick a man while he's drowned. I thought you'd never ask. Come then Lord Rosfield.

144
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:22,300
Spar with me. If you believe yourself worthy to be called shield of the flame then prove it

145
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,039
as you wish my lord. I'm so much stronger than you. So much better than you and so much older than

146
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,320
you and so much more wise. Well done boy. Well done.

147
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:43,900
Oh music. The will gauge indicates an opponent's will to fight back.

148
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,019
Break their spirit by landing attacks and strike them when they are vulnerable.

149
00:36:49,159 --> 00:37:00,940
Okay. All right. Back it up.

150
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:29,619
You're serious. Okay. Jump. This is oh staggering your enemies. Lord Murdoch's will has been broken

151
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,380
leaving him staggered. Try dealing as much damage as you can before he regains his senses.

152
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:40,260
Use R2 plus squared execute rising flames a powerful iconic ability. Okay. So when they're down go.

153
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:53,510
When I used all the tools at my disposal.

154
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:19,340
Cool. Oh let's go. Yeah.

155
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,179
I probably would rebind. I'm going to rebind circle to dodge and R1 to be that move.

156
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,639
Just burned in my brain. That circle is always just dodge.

157
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:50,469
It's taken me long enough. That was a display worthy of your father.

158
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,949
There's already enough option for that. Okay. You are a true shield of the flame and let no one

159
00:38:54,949 --> 00:39:17,019
tell you otherwise. Including me. What are you? Back to your drills. I was watching the vaude.

160
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:34,840
Meanwhile you're live. We're live right now. Final fantasy 16. Good demo. Do you think that hurt?

161
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:42,969
I was just tired. Phoenix's flames are a gift. You mustn't waste them. It isn't a waste. My

162
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:50,570
shields look after me. Why shouldn't I? That's why you were coughing this morning too.

163
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:58,250
You shouldn't be outdoors. It's just a cold. Don't push yourself. I wonder how the party

164
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:04,010
system will be in this game. Will it be party based? Do you swap between characters or just

165
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:17,219
play as one character? I wonder. I'm curious. Your grace. I would gladly brave hell itself

166
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:27,320
to see my darling boy. Okay. Gentlemen, Rosaria thanks you for your indefatigable loyalty.

167
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:42,550
Thank you, your grace. We live to serve. Joshua, you should not be out of doors.

168
00:40:43,349 --> 00:41:01,559
We have discussed this. I'm sorry. Good day to you, mother. Come, Joshua.

169
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:08,219
Your father will be expecting us. Leather noise. Yeah, the leather noise.

170
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:27,349
Lord Murdock. Your grace. That was way worse. What a way to treat your own flesh and blood.

171
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:33,079
I know. It's not his fault. Not everyone can be born the phoenix.

172
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,920
You should just wear a big leather coat one day. I don't think I want to do that

173
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:58,219
in Las Vegas. That does not sound fun. Yeah, I've got a great idea. What is it? 120 degrees outside?

174
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:21,019
Yeah, give me a big leather coat. A regal, a regal chocobo. Look at how regal that chocobo is walking.

175
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:45,750
Rise, my friends. Welcome home, father. Thank you, Joshua. Would I look good in red? You are well

176
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:50,630
adressed. What do you guys think? Yes, father. Much better. I don't know. I don't think I could pull

177
00:42:50,630 --> 00:43:05,719
red off. Is that so? Yeah, I'm definitely more of a blue gray. You'll make a fine purple. I like

178
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:21,909
purple too. Lift up your head, girl. Thank you, your grace. You were in red for that show you were in

179
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:36,460
the week. That was a puzzler, though. War is coming, my boy. You must make ready. Is the situation

180
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:50,739
truly so grave? Come to the throne room. We will top there. Yes, father. Your grace. Shields dismissed.

181
00:43:51,619 --> 00:44:06,039
That didn't even hurt. Your grace. What does your grace mean? Your grace. Does that mean like

182
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:17,670
I find you to be your very like your bright and your grace, your honor? Like it's my honor to be

183
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:32,250
in your presence or something. What does it mean? Your grace, your honor. It's like bowing. Okay,

184
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:41,929
yeah. They were considered holy. God's grace. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, should you

185
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:48,260
find yourself lost, do not fret. Hold down L3 and trust in your animal instinct to point you in the

186
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,340
right direction. Your current destination will be displayed. All right, yeah, don't worry. I know

187
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:59,510
where we're going. I will tell you, though, if me and Holly were ever lost and I looked over and I

188
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:05,690
said, hey, don't worry, honey. We'll just trust my animal instinct. We'll get there. I don't know if

189
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:16,900
we'll get there or not. I just start like sniffing. Wait, where are we going? Okay, cool. So, let's see.

190
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,300
I'm not sure. I need to speak with father.

191
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:33,539
All right, what's this? Secret useful items can be found across the realm by those who know where

192
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:48,420
to look. Okay, what is this? A potion. Should I walk? We should probably RP walk, right? Make

193
00:45:48,420 --> 00:46:06,019
for the throne room. Just skipping to the throne room. Close the gates. Let's hope the side entrance

194
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:19,619
is still open. I actually kind of like moving around like this. All right, would anybody feel

195
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:33,719
like, hey, stop doing that. That's skipping. Stop having so much fun Clive. What do you think you're

196
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:56,579
doing? Good as new. Forgive me. Your grace, you just put more bacteria on it and kind of dirty too.

197
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:08,250
Why do people keep doing that? It doesn't do anything. It was no trouble. Really? Oh, do not

198
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:15,050
indulge him. To be allowed to stand in your lordship's presence is more than his kind deserves.

199
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:20,809
Why? Neither the empire nor the republic treat their bearers half so well. He was lucky to be

200
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:32,579
born in your father's dominion. Very lucky as I remind him every day. Imagine seeing your lord

201
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:39,139
just skipping around through town. It'd be like, oh, I'd be like, all right, at least he's happy. At

202
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:47,159
least the lord is happy. I trust his good fortune will continue. Of course, if that is your lordship's

203
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:55,480
wish. Don't work too hard. Remember, it is for the good of the dodgy that you serve. It goes the

204
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:10,489
baker with the tray up. As do we all, my lord. As do we all. Come along now to your duties.

205
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:46,489
Yeah, get back to what you were doing. And by the way, it's always lord. Good day.

206
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:58,949
Looks like they're getting ready for supper. I think someone's hungry. I see a lot of minus

207
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:07,030
dudes. It's always lord. What kind of dialogue was that? By the way, it's always lord. Yeah, no,

208
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,309
that's what they called him. That's literally what they said. Both said it. Why am I acting like they

209
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:25,929
didn't say that? The optimal way to travel. Nice and quiet in here, isn't it? Oh, I just love the flower.

210
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:34,659
There's Joshua. Does anybody else feel like they can skip faster than they can run?

211
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,309
I really think I can. I think if I was in a full sprint versus a full skip,

212
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:45,429
I would be able to do, I would go faster skipping. That child is the future of our nation.

213
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh no, am I? Some large gates and stiff levers require extra effort to operate.

214
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:09,400
Use X to access them and then hold R2 to push. Oh, whoops. Dude, this, oh, this is weird. The

215
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:19,820
PlayStation 5 has this, it's giving me, it's like feedback. I actually have to press this kind of

216
00:50:19,820 --> 00:51:02,219
like hard. Whoa, cool. Whoa, whoa. Good luck. What's going on here? You commanded my presence,

217
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:09,400
your grace. How may I serve you? All right, you can stop licking my boots.

218
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:16,360
Your mother isn't here. Do the territories fare any better?

219
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:27,829
Most lie under a pall of black. In just these few moons, the blight has taken lie on all of

220
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:34,119
the northern reaches. It is only a matter of time before it crosses the border.

221
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:41,559
Nearly every available bed in the capital is already occupied by those fleeing the

222
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:48,789
deadlands. Even if we were to send themself to Port Isolde, more would only follow in their wake.

223
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,280
Every day we delay brings us closer to disaster.

224
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,800
Every throne I've seen looks really uncomfortable to sit in.

225
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,920
Against the Iron Kingdom. Did anybody ever have like a comfortable

226
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,199
fucking throne? They made like soft pillows and shit.

227
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:07,860
We have traded blows with them for too long. It is time to end it.

228
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:15,909
At the very least, we must secure Drake's breath. Without the blessing of the Mother Crystal,

229
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:18,469
we cannot defend our realm from the spread of the blight.

230
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:26,599
The Iron Blood will not relinquish it easily. This will be a bitter fight.

231
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:33,289
We ride for Phoenix Gate tomorrow. There we will listen to the words of our ancestors.

232
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:34,730
Horse mechanic? As tradition dictates.

233
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:38,280
Am I to go with you as Joshua Shield?

234
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,190
There was no ergonomics back then.

235
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:48,679
And I feel like the first order of business for me would be

236
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,599
get me a pillow to put under my ass to sit on.

237
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:52,280
You will have heard the reports, I am sure,

238
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,239
of beast men from the north being sighted within our borders.

239
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,719
Goblins in the Stillwind Marshes. I know of the rumors, yes.

240
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,550
Then you know what must be done. I will give you two good men.

241
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,630
Royal ass pillow.

242
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,349
While we ride north tomorrow, you will journey to Stillwind.

243
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:13,829
Search it and clear it. Then you will join us at Phoenix Gate.

244
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:27,699
It is time to prove your strength and shut your mother up for good.

245
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:39,030
I will do my duty, Your Grace.

246
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:44,469
Okay, good. I'm so ready.

247
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,449
That will be all. Rest well. We ride at dawn.

248
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,340
Yes, Your Grace.

249
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,570
Again, this is the demo. Get it right now.

250
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,070
PS5.

251
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:11,940
Active Time Lore. Hold that to access the Active Time Lore feature,

252
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,219
a compilation of important information relevant to Clive's current story progression.

253
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:20,070
ATL can even be viewed during most cutscenes.

254
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,789
What does that mean?

255
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:25,050
Oh, okay.

256
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,699
So it's important people and this is actually good

257
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:34,809
because I forget literally every single person's name.

258
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:40,679
Okay, cool.

259
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,230
Wait, did they actually add the caveman mode I was talking about?

260
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,639
Is this in the game?

261
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:50,360
Didn't I talk about how much I fucking wanted this so bad?

262
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,340
How badly I wanted this?

263
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,230
It's a paragraph to explain just here it is.

264
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,550
Hey, look. Look, there's like three sentences.

265
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:04,980
There's a lore button where you can just read like one small paragraph.

266
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:09,349
Okay, I'm happy about that.

267
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:17,190
Okay, retire to your chambers.

268
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:25,719
Hey, Dodd. What do you think of my training?

269
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:55,530
How do I get out of here? How do I get up there?

270
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:12,409
Oh, this way. The castle's nice.

271
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,250
Will you still be skipping as him 15 years later?

272
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,929
That's a core part of my character's personality right now.

273
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:25,130
Do you think I'm going to stop doing that?

274
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:53,829
How long will you be away this time?

275
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:59,769
Not long. Four days. Maybe five.

276
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,090
And you will be taking Joshua?

277
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,690
Well, I can't exactly leave him behind, can I?

278
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,800
The blood of the Rosfields runs in his veins.

279
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,119
Let me ask, does the demo have a lot of cutscene stuff?

280
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:18,599
Yeah, I think it's starting to build up the story.

281
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,360
Only the dominant can enter the apothecary, so yes, I'm taking Joshua.

282
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,440
Your demo progress does carry on to the main game when it releases itself.

283
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:38,340
I don't know that. The boy is also the phoenix, the heir to the throne.

284
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,059
You can't keep him in swaddling clothes all of his life.

285
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,420
Don't worry. Clive will watch over him.

286
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:48,739
Can you skip in the full game?

287
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:52,340
As a youth of but 15 years, he's already a fine soldier.

288
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,340
He will make a splendid shield.

289
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,940
Yes, you can.

290
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,900
You see more in him than the phoenix did.

291
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,659
He was rejected, Elwyn.

292
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:04,329
Our household has no place for such a failure.

293
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:06,570
He is worthless, a man like any other.

294
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:11,030
As am I, my dear.

295
00:58:12,809 --> 00:58:16,730
Nonsense. You are the archduke of Rosaria.

296
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,530
Not this again.

297
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:22,360
You know, as well as I do, that I only sit upon the throne

298
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,519
because my father was taken before his time.

299
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:30,420
I am merely warming the seat till Joshua comes of age.

300
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:35,590
You are your father's firstborn son.

301
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,309
And you sit upon the throne.

302
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,719
All is in its right place.

303
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,019
And my son, you have not disgraced our noble blood.

304
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:53,659
Without men like Clive to keep us safe, your precious noble.

305
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:56,860
Who are these people?

306
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,360
Okay.

307
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:04,539
Look at how fucking perfect that thing really is.

308
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:06,230
This is great.

309
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,840
In the middle of the cutscene, I can be like, wait.

310
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,079
Okay, this is Annabelle of Rossfield.

311
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:12,760
Duchess of Rosaria.

312
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,199
Wife of Archduke Elwyn and mother to Clive and Joshua.

313
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:17,070
Perfect.

314
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,489
I know who this is now.

315
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:21,690
Joshua of Rossfield.

316
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,050
Second son of the Archduke of Rosaria,

317
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:28,889
Joshua was appointed heir to the Ducal throne by virtue of his awakening

318
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:31,289
as the dominant of the phoenix.

319
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:34,489
His love, actually, that's actually really cool.

320
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:36,170
Let's go back to it now.

321
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,090
Hold on a second.

322
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,860
Pause it one more time.

323
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:48,579
Don't let me be in charge of pausing anything.

324
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:51,619
I'm imagining, and I know I'm just kind of messing around here,

325
00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:54,679
but I'm imagining if you hear somebody say something

326
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,440
or talk about something, you could just pause it and be like, wait.

327
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,280
They said Rosalith Castle was out, right?

328
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,000
Okay, that's this one.

329
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:02,739
That's cool.

330
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,579
That's cool.

331
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:09,380
I like that.

332
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,659
We have an early start.

333
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,260
I'm going to sleep.

334
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:24,059
Go back and read the queen's profile.

335
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:28,360
Wait.

336
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,320
Oh, it's whatever is currently in the frame.

337
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,119
Is that how it works?

338
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:35,510
I suppose, let me see.

339
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,900
I think that's how it works.

340
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,250
This is it then.

341
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,280
Prove yourself.

342
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,480
Wishing on a star.

343
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,449
I'll talk about a couple things after this too,

344
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:48,650
because somebody brought this up,

345
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,130
but I want to make sure I tell people this

346
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,570
because I feel like people that know this would go, oh, okay.

347
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:55,070
Right.

348
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:01,110
Yeah, that's cool.

349
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:04,170
All right, so you're born a princess of the Northern Territories.

350
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,409
Jill was made a ward of Rosaria after her homeland's incessant raids

351
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:11,989
were quelled by the Duchy.

352
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,280
She was raised in Rosalith Castle alongside Clive and Joshua

353
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:26,150
who came to love her as a sister.

354
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,269
That's so helpful for me.

355
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:35,699
You're going with them tomorrow, aren't you?

356
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:40,809
I am Joshua's shield.

357
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:45,659
I'm sworn to protect him.

358
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:47,179
He takes too many risks.

359
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,300
Jerma mode.

360
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,380
I only wish I could save him from himself.

361
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,820
You mean a good mode.

362
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:56,659
Clive, you...

363
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:57,860
I have another mission too.

364
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,130
Father has given me my first command.

365
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:04,889
Well...

366
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:05,610
What does command mean?

367
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,090
If you're not going to pray to Meteor for your safety...

368
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,210
He said a word I don't understand.

369
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:09,690
Command?

370
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,320
It's not here.

371
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,039
Command?

372
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:14,840
What's that mean?

373
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,210
I shall just have to do it for you.

374
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:37,880
Dude's gonna pull this off every cutscene now.

375
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,159
I promise I'm not gonna.

376
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,480
There's going to be another war, isn't there?

377
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,920
Since coming here, I've begun to take peace for granted.

378
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,920
I assume the war between our nations would be the last.

379
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:59,000
But it never really ends, does it?

380
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,170
No.

381
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:11,820
The next war will be bigger than before.

382
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:15,750
But you'll be all right, won't you, Clive?

383
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:18,389
You're a shield of Rosaria, after all.

384
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:19,670
I'm blessed by the phoenix.

385
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:37,690
It's getting cold.

386
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:39,800
We should go in.

387
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:42,170
Bye, lady.

388
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,280
Good night, Clive.

389
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,670
And you press the lower button to find out why it's cold.

390
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:53,639
It just...

391
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:54,199
All right, you press...

392
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:54,840
You go like this.

393
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,889
And it has like the forecast in the top right.

394
01:03:58,889 --> 01:03:59,690
It's chilly.

395
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,530
65 degrees at Rosalith Castle.

396
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:07,369
Northwest winds blowing at 15 miles per hour.

397
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:07,929
That'd be cool.

398
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:21,989
You broke your promise already?

399
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:23,110
Well, that was the end of the cutscene.

400
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:26,019
Also, do I have a second?

401
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:26,519
Let's see.

402
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,380
People were saying Devil May Cry.

403
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,940
So the combat director of this game,

404
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:35,219
Ryota Suzuki?

405
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:38,579
Ryota Suzuki worked on Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.

406
01:04:39,219 --> 01:04:42,699
So that's the combat director of the game.

407
01:04:51,369 --> 01:05:03,670
Also, the director and producer of Final Fantasy XIV.

408
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:07,909
And the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy XIV also worked on this.

409
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,219
If that is perking your ears up a little, if you liked those games,

410
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,260
I don't know.

411
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:22,579
We'll see.

412
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:38,730
Yeah, that's Yoshido.

413
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:46,699
And Masayoshi Soken, composer of the game.

414
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:04,460
The combat director is interesting, though.

415
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:12,619
I'm very curious how it actually plays out fighting and battle scenarios.

416
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,159
It's actually a dream team to make a Final Fantasy game.

417
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:22,170
It sounds like it.

418
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,170
The Beastmen are a fierce foe.

419
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,730
We underestimate them at our peril.

420
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,449
We need some lore?

421
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:42,090
Not today, we won't.

422
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,210
Wait, we need to know who these people are.

423
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:55,510
One of the stables of Rosalith Castle,

424
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:00,710
Rosio was chosen by the young Clive Rosfield to be his personal steed and raised by him from a chick.

425
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:04,550
She's a proud bird and deeply loyal to her master,

426
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:12,230
quickly turning her beak upon any but he who should attempt to pet her.

427
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:16,539
So wait, Sir Tyler, let us do our duty.

428
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:19,659
They don't have lore because somebody said,

429
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:22,139
I don't think they have lore because they're probably dead soon.

430
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:23,019
To the marshes then.

431
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:23,980
Well, you don't know that.

432
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,460
That's not why they don't have a lore card.

433
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:37,190
Blessing of the crystals go with us.

434
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,389
Over world map.

435
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:45,820
The world map displays all the locations indicated by glowing pins currently available

436
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,500
to Clive via fast travel.

437
01:07:48,139 --> 01:07:52,219
OK, so we're going here.

438
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:53,260
So this is still wind.

439
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:56,659
Make for still wind.

440
01:07:56,659 --> 01:08:12,710
Those guys weren't as important as a bird.

441
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:15,130
I think that bird's probably really important.

442
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,539
No, I'm not going to lore check.

443
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:29,300
These guys don't have a lore card.

444
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:30,710
Watch.

445
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,529
Whoa, shit.

446
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:36,090
Sir Wade.

447
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,729
A loyal shield of Rosaria chosen by Lord Commander Rodney Murdock

448
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:44,020
to accompany Clive on his expedition to still wind.

449
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:50,819
Once, but a lowborn page, Wade was inspired to join the ranks after a woodpile fell on him

450
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:54,149
and his life was saved by a young Joshua.

451
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:54,789
OK, cool.

452
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:55,989
What about you?

453
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,340
A little bit more for Tyler here.

454
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:05,140
A loyal shield of Rosaria and Sion of a noble family.

455
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,560
Tyler followed in his father's footsteps in entering the service of the duchy,

456
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,170
rising to the position of right-hand man to the Lord Commander.

457
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:18,010
He was chosen by Lord Murdock to accompany Clive on his expedition to still wind.

458
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:24,310
A level head who could be trusted not only to obey the young lord's orders and keep him safe,

459
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,100
but to help keep the fiery sir Wade in line.

460
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:29,899
Goblins.

461
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,609
We don't know anything, but I don't want to see that yet.

462
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,289
Keep your eyes open for those goblins.

463
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:37,560
Ports placed them in this area.

464
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,720
It's all swamps from here.

465
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:41,800
Watch your step, my lord.

466
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,199
And everything else.

467
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:51,670
OK, lost in a fog.

468
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,579
Feeling overwhelmed?

469
01:09:57,579 --> 01:10:02,359
Try equipping one or more of the five timely accessories.

470
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:07,159
For example, the ring of timely strikes allows its wearer to chain complex attack combos

471
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,399
only using square.

472
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:13,479
The ring of timely focus slows time before an incoming attack.

473
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:18,100
As with all items, timely accessories can be equipped or not equipped on the gear tab.

474
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,119
Oh, I think I'm all right.

475
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:21,689
We'll be fine.

476
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:29,479
I said to check.

477
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:36,380
Not exactly the most well-maintained path.

478
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,939
But who do you imagine would maintain it?

479
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:40,699
Oh no, I lost my touch.

480
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:42,140
All fled from the blight.

481
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,020
No more skipping.

482
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,270
The music is preparing me for something.

483
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,750
I like this.

484
01:10:53,750 --> 01:11:05,479
The old village of still wind is ahead.

485
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,890
Not that there's a lot left of it.

486
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,840
Get the item.

487
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,609
Two gil.

488
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:16,020
Two bucks.

489
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:20,229
Wait, I gotta check over here.

490
01:11:20,869 --> 01:11:28,579
I didn't try to jump over that.

491
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:30,739
I was trying to touch the butterflies that are above it.

492
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,109
What are they doing?

493
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,460
Oh, you fucked up so bad.

494
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:05,859
How could you have stepped on one of the sticks?

495
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:18,170
Oh, first time, first combat.

496
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:21,340
OK.

497
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,739
Oh, shit.

498
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:31,300
All right, cool.

499
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,979
So the reports were true.

500
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:45,020
We should press on.

501
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:46,699
There may be more ahead.

502
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:49,369
Floor check.

503
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,579
All right, we have pictures now.

504
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:03,529
Did I miss any items or anything?

505
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:04,090
I don't think so.

506
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:17,239
I see a shiny.

507
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,039
Can I get in here?

508
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:26,140
Yep.

509
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,020
Strength tonic.

510
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,779
Keep slaying those goblins.

511
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:37,960
All right.

512
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,010
Welcome to still wind.

513
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:45,399
Have care, my lord.

514
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:46,520
Oh, more goblins.

515
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:00,380
Some enemies will drop gil or items upon the defeat.

516
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,819
Loot is gathered automatically.

517
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:26,869
OK, gold loot on the ground.

518
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:29,750
I do appreciate the small denomination of currency,

519
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,380
but I don't want 10,000 gil in my pocket.

520
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,260
I'd want like 10.

521
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:39,989
Can't break it.

522
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:50,300
Oh, ocean.

523
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,180
Should I heal now?

524
01:14:51,899 --> 01:15:02,470
Strength tonic.

525
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,430
I should probably put these on the bar.

526
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:09,350
Yeah, the music is wonderful.

527
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,640
This should be a master class on how to do background music that feels engaging.

528
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,930
But it's not it's not so much.

529
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:22,729
It's not offensive.

530
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:47,720
Oh, they are spell slingers.

531
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,680
New enemies approach.

532
01:15:49,399 --> 01:16:06,010
OK, I'm going to.

533
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:11,140
OK, I was going to say I can just do that whenever I want.

534
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,699
If only you could speak goblin.

535
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:35,260
Wait, lore check the spell slinger.

536
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,859
There's not going to be individual lore cards for every enemy type.

537
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:46,039
Can I do anything else with the fire?

538
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:51,560
I wonder there actually might be maybe.

539
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:07,609
Haven't pressing R2 like that is definitely feels different for me.

540
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,140
This is the next generation of controllers in my hand.

541
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:27,399
I've barely experienced that and this is a PlayStation thing.

542
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:30,199
This is a I have to I have to squeeze it.

543
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:31,960
You have to squeeze that shit.

544
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,239
You have to squeeze it.

545
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:35,960
We should be nearing the old village square.

546
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,079
It might not be a nest of goblins.

547
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:47,689
Oh, he's the ad guy.

548
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:50,090
No, I've I have never experienced this before.

549
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,970
I've never pressed the right trigger before and had to like squeeze it a little.

550
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:55,770
I just tell it.

551
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:58,489
This is my first experience playing with a piece station five.

552
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,630
We're trapped.

553
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:20,069
My lord, I'm working on it.

554
01:18:20,869 --> 01:18:22,789
Well, bring it on.

555
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:23,289
Let's go.

556
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:33,579
He's the leader to take care of his followers first.

557
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:38,810
Oh, can't have been the hurt.

558
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:40,329
Let's go.

559
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:41,210
You have to ask.

560
01:18:42,649 --> 01:19:08,489
What do you got?

561
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:08,810
What do you got?

562
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,130
What do you got?

563
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:09,529
What do you got?

564
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,439
Coming.

565
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:28,710
There was one.

566
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:29,510
Holy shit.

567
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:34,199
OK, let's do it.

568
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:42,199
So wait on three larger enemies must be faced with caution.

569
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,239
If farmer HP than their smaller counterparts will often use devastating

570
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,239
abilities to overwhelm opponents.

571
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:50,600
Use the blessing of the phoenix to not only deal considerable damage

572
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,079
to these enemies, but also break their wills.

573
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,539
Breaking an enemy's will can stagger it, leaving it unable to act invulnerable.

574
01:19:57,539 --> 01:19:58,180
Let's go.

575
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:20,699
This is fun.

576
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:21,020
All right.

577
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,819
Enemies will become partially staggered when their will gauge is reduced to 50%.

578
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,260
I don't want to check the lore right now.

579
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:29,180
Creating a short opening.

580
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:33,659
Hold on.

581
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:34,699
Let me look at the lore book.

582
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:38,090
I know.

583
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,239
I can't look at the lore book right now.

584
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:57,859
Oh, shit.

585
01:20:57,859 --> 01:20:59,779
OK, I got to time it better than that field.

586
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:05,380
All right, let's go.

587
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,800
Co-op, let's do it.

588
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:12,420
Completely reducing an enemy's will gauge will stagger it.

589
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,119
Extra damage is dealt when an enemy is fully staggered,

590
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:18,920
increasing with each strike landed up to a maximum of 150%.

591
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,840
The total amount of damage dealt during this time is displayed

592
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,760
upon the enemy regaining its senses.

593
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:25,880
That's cool.

594
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,239
OK.

595
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:31,100
So it just counts it all up.

596
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:32,949
All right, let's start counting.

597
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,119
Oh, quadruple dodge.

598
01:21:59,779 --> 01:22:00,340
Dude.

599
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,060
All right.

600
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,100
You got any more?

601
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,060
You got any more in there?

602
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:28,199
All right, let's end it.

603
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:42,579
Go.

604
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:43,859
Who is it?

605
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,020
Giga Chad.

606
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,220
Level up.

607
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:54,010
Do I have to put any points in or anything?

608
01:22:57,029 --> 01:22:57,909
Hard leather.

609
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:03,319
Following important battles, a separate results screen

610
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:05,960
will appear displaying battle performance and rewards.

611
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:09,210
Rewards are based on performance and may include items, gear,

612
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:14,869
ability points, and experience points.

613
01:23:14,869 --> 01:23:15,189
OK.

614
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,789
There's gear.

615
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:30,500
I'm going to get stopped this dude.

616
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,739
Come back and fight, you coward.

617
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:34,619
After him.

618
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:35,819
Before he summons the rest.

619
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:37,340
But I-

620
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:38,380
Hold on, let me get an item first.

621
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:42,619
OK.

622
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,619
So I got to go to the gear tab.

623
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:52,069
Learning new ones require ability points.

624
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:58,939
OK, here we are.

625
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:01,510
The attributes tab provides a comprehensive overview

626
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,630
of Clive's current level status, abilities, and gear.

627
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:07,560
All right, what does the gear look like?

628
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,140
The gear and icons tab is used for equipping weapons and armor

629
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,899
as well as assigning iconic abilities.

630
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:20,520
All right, so this is 10 defense.

631
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:22,649
Oh, I like that.

632
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:24,010
Like that.

633
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:25,319
OK.

634
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,760
Do I need new belts?

635
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:31,899
No, I don't need to put on them.

636
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:32,699
Put any of those on.

637
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,159
Abilities.

638
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,199
Ability points can be spent in the abilities tab

639
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:41,640
to acquire new abilities as well as upgrade existing ones.

640
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,840
If you are unsatisfied with Clive's current build,

641
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:47,800
reset all abilities and try again.

642
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,479
There's no penalty for doing so.

643
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:53,829
OK, this indicates an ability's capacity for dealing damage

644
01:24:53,829 --> 01:24:55,109
and for breaking a target's will.

645
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,699
Melee attack, skill points too.

646
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,619
OK, this is-

647
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:08,420
This is going to be-

648
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,369
All right, I'm excited.

649
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,220
All right, so should I-

650
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:13,939
What should I upgrade?

651
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:16,869
Can I upgrade this?

652
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,550
Just the melee ability?

653
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:22,550
I have 152 ability points.

654
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,520
Do magic instead?

655
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:28,699
Magic burst?

656
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,180
Oh, you can do that in between every single swing.

657
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:44,739
Charred magic?

658
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,100
Hold to increase potency.

659
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:48,310
Stomp?

660
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:52,149
Upgrade skipping.

661
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:56,729
Phoenix shift, which makes that-

662
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:57,289
I don't have enough.

663
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:00,810
Let's go with one of these.

664
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:02,170
OK, swift recovery.

665
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:03,909
That's probably pretty good.

666
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:06,149
Taunt?

667
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:10,579
Burning blade?

668
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,399
Yeah, I want that.

669
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:17,979
I want this even stronger.

670
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:18,539
Do I have enough?

671
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,989
Down thrust?

672
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:25,880
Lunge?

673
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:27,079
I like that too.

674
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,670
All right, I'm going to do lunge.

675
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,609
And burning blade.

676
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,699
So this is hold square,

677
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:38,579
and this one is square and X at the same time.

678
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,149
All right, I don't want to spend too money though.

679
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:48,140
This is holding triangle, OK?

680
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,100
I want to save my points.

681
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:51,380
All right, let's go.

682
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:51,859
So let me see.

683
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:54,779
Nice.

684
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,539
And then lunge.

685
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,140
And then if I hold, I can get a fire sword.

686
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:05,539
And then saving in the demo.

687
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,579
All of your progress carries over, by the way.

688
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:13,979
Whatever you do in the demo,

689
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:15,739
carries over to the real game.

690
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:20,149
Stomp is going to be essential with how cheap it is, probably.

691
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:23,939
Well, we'll see.

692
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:30,939
Come on, I could have hit him.

693
01:27:30,939 --> 01:27:31,739
I could have hit him.

694
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,409
Please.

695
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:42,810
It didn't really cause a problem.

696
01:27:43,609 --> 01:28:01,029
Is this the precursor to the real big scary boss, I wonder?

697
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:08,020
Uh-oh, yeah.

698
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:10,100
It's never going to be that easy.

699
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,899
Oh my goodness gracious, OK.

700
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:30,250
I'm awful.

701
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:32,149
Quick climb.

702
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,630
Look at the box.

703
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:48,020
I'm standing that.

704
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,470
Oh, I missed the lunge.

705
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,789
Sorry.

706
01:29:22,619 --> 01:29:24,380
Chip damage, chip damage, chip damage.

707
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:41,640
Swing, swing, swing, swing.

708
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:50,600
You're good.

709
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,640
This is as good as mine.

710
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:55,960
Oh, shit.

711
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,720
Oh, no.

712
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:05,960
All right.

713
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,119
There's a cinematic strike mode.

714
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:12,090
When the screen flashes blue like this during a pivotal moment in battle,

715
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,890
a square before time runs out.

716
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:15,210
All right.

717
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,489
There's a QTE.

718
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:18,010
There's a cinematic QTE.

719
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:19,369
Let's go.

720
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,069
1,100.

721
01:30:24,069 --> 01:30:24,710
That's pretty good.

722
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:28,310
I wonder if there's a cinematic upgrade tree.

723
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,819
Before it recovers.

724
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:42,729
And one more.

725
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:04,090
Oh, there's a parry in the game, too.

726
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:06,409
Oh, I'm fucking playing this for sure.

727
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:11,430
Use square just as a permanent attack, but it temporarily slows time and shit.

728
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:11,590
All right.

729
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:12,229
What do I do?

730
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,630
Press.

731
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:13,189
What is it?

732
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:13,590
Square.

733
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,880
There's a parry in the game.

734
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,920
You've got me now.

735
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,560
You've got me.

736
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,039
I'm here.

737
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,510
So it's right when it...

738
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,909
Wait, I...

739
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:26,550
Oh, I did it.

740
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,140
Let me try it again.

741
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:42,729
Oh, shit.

742
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:43,369
Sorry.

743
01:31:43,369 --> 01:31:52,489
Oh, did it work?

744
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:53,770
Oh, no.

745
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:54,170
Hold on.

746
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:54,970
I'll get it.

747
01:31:54,970 --> 01:31:56,569
It's a square right when you're about to get hit.

748
01:31:57,289 --> 01:32:01,350
I'm just going to practice it.

749
01:32:01,989 --> 01:32:03,579
Ow.

750
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:09,300
Am I doing it wrong?

751
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:10,659
I think I'm doing it wrong.

752
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,869
Square.

753
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:37,449
Stick to dodge roll.

754
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:46,760
Something else.

755
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:47,960
Cinematic evasion.

756
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,100
Okay.

757
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:01,590
I'm a caster.

758
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:02,310
I'm going to stay back here.

759
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:17,939
Oh, I'm good.

760
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:29,260
Oh, wow.

761
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:33,619
True.

762
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:46,390
I kind of like these two guys, too.

763
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:49,829
I didn't care at all until 10 seconds ago about these two.

764
01:33:50,390 --> 01:34:11,859
That should be it.

765
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:22,279
I got to do the thrust more often.

766
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:58,100
Whoops.

767
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,979
Don't do it.

768
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:01,479
I don't have any heals left.

769
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:02,199
I got to be careful.

770
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:02,680
I don't want to...

771
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,159
Oh, fuck.

772
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:04,199
I'm going to die right now.

773
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:21,300
All right.

774
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,739
Time to play like a coward.

775
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:25,539
Are those guys okay?

776
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:28,760
Here we go.

777
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:29,319
I'm going to dodge it.

778
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:38,810
There it is.

779
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,130
Get him!

780
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:46,250
Almost through there.

781
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,050
That's true.

782
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:57,220
Almost died to the tutorial boss.

783
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,609
Well, the tutorial boss is there for you to learn.

784
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:01,210
How the game functions.

785
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:03,579
I think I did a pretty good job.

786
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:20,020
Oh, my lord.

787
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,100
Thanks.

788
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:25,140
Never thought I'd see it.

789
01:36:26,439 --> 01:36:30,119
Not just goblins in Rosaria, but more balls, too.

790
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,079
I'll petition his grace to send a detachment.

791
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:39,270
If we don't stop them here, they'll be at our gates before long.

792
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:44,250
We should get moving.

793
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:47,210
We don't want to be caught out here after dark.

794
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:50,569
If we set off now, we can still reach Phoenix Gate before nightfall.

795
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,720
Third boss lands.

796
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:11,189
Is it still alive?

797
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:11,590
It might be.

798
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:32,619
This is the Phoenix Gate.

799
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:49,609
Check it out.

800
01:37:49,609 --> 01:37:50,970
Some time later.

801
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:27,270
The lord check.

802
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:33,720
Oh, imagine there was like 40 circles.

803
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:37,590
Is there updated info, though?

804
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:44,020
There's a little indicator on here.

805
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,880
Oh, maybe it means he just showed up.

806
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:46,359
Okay.

807
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:51,739
The young lord has a bright future ahead of him.

808
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:55,689
In one of these nights, he may even deign to join us.

809
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:06,970
It does have updated info.

810
01:39:07,529 --> 01:39:11,850
I really do appreciate that, though,

811
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,409
because I have said many, many times how I just kind of...

812
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:17,659
Sometimes I just need to open up like a thing

813
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:19,899
and give me like two sentences of who the fuck these people are.

814
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:35,670
Makes it easy to jump back in.

815
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:39,670
Potentially days or weeks later, too.

816
01:40:15,289 --> 01:40:18,170
We cannot live without the blessing of the crystals.

817
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:21,300
And the crystals work their magic through us.

818
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:24,819
Eat that bread so badly.

819
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:26,899
You have been blessed, Joshua.

820
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,479
Blessed to be a dominant.

821
01:40:29,479 --> 01:40:31,560
To wield the power of an icon.

822
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:35,939
Our family has been chosen to share that power with the people.

823
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:40,170
So that is what we must do.

824
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,109
Brunk.

825
01:41:04,069 --> 01:41:06,069
Singing, eating a shitload of bread.

826
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:11,560
That sounds like a great time, doesn't it?

827
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,520
That sounds great.

828
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,979
A room full of carbs, yeah.

829
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:39,590
It's an off-brand meeting.

830
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,779
I don't think we would get very much done.

831
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,800
Lore check the dog.

832
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:21,159
Torgal, Clive's faithful friend,

833
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:25,560
brought back from one of Archduke Elwynn's expeditions to the frozen Northern Territories,

834
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:29,319
where he was found half-starved and shivering in a snowfield,

835
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:31,960
having presumably been separated from his pack.

836
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,869
Elwynn gifted the puppy to Clive upon his return,

837
01:42:34,869 --> 01:42:37,270
and the two became nigh inseparable.

838
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:42,949
What are you doing out here?

839
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:45,159
I didn't see you at the feast.

840
01:42:46,539 --> 01:42:49,739
Feasts are the only time shields are allowed to take their ease,

841
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:54,020
and I've never really been one for cakes and ale.

842
01:42:54,579 --> 01:42:56,680
It's the vegetables I don't like.

843
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:07,430
That was cool.

844
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,149
I hear you slew a mawble.

845
01:43:16,869 --> 01:43:20,630
All the men were singing your praises.

846
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:22,699
They never used to.

847
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:27,979
When I joined the ranks, everyone thought I was a spoiled little lordling.

848
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:32,199
If I didn't know how to handle a sword, I'd be a laughingstock.

849
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:35,399
The Archduke's first-born failure.

850
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,149
Why have I-

851
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:39,750
You're the one they really believe in.

852
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,829
Why have I heard this voice actor before?

853
01:43:41,829 --> 01:43:42,329
I'm jealous.

854
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,380
That's not true.

855
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,180
They don't believe in me.

856
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,020
They believe in the power of the Dominant.

857
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:53,319
I heard this.

858
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:58,119
My brother the phoenix, ruler of a life and death.

859
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,329
It isn't fair.

860
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,090
It should have been you.

861
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,619
I don't have what it takes to lead our people.

862
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,699
I don't have the strength, but you do.

863
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,760
Let me see, hold on.

864
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:20,409
Every man has his duty.

865
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:24,460
Ours was decided long ago,

866
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:29,180
when our ancestors chose to instate the Dominant as the Archduke of Rosaria.

867
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:31,319
Hold on, I'll find a-

868
01:44:31,319 --> 01:44:35,079
You need to ensure that whenever our nation stood on a precipice,

869
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,880
the phoenix would rise from the flames to drag us back from the brink.

870
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:45,239
The fate of Rosaria sits on the Dominant shoulders.

871
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,800
It is your duty to bear that burden.

872
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,239
Holy shit.

873
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:52,039
What about you?

874
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:53,560
This guy's done so much work.

875
01:44:54,439 --> 01:44:57,859
This is like an unbelievable catalog of work.

876
01:44:57,859 --> 01:45:00,569
That is why I was given the phoenix's blessing.

877
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,479
To keep our future rulers safe.

878
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:05,479
No matter what.

879
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,760
Wait, I got the wrong person.

880
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,850
However hard it gets.

881
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,130
Thank you, Tive.

882
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:16,810
I know you'll always take care of me.

883
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:20,939
I think I- do I have the wrong person?

884
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:25,539
Where I can do that, you need to take care of yourself.

885
01:45:25,539 --> 01:45:26,340
No, no, no, I do.

886
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:27,460
I have the right person.

887
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:33,500
Right?

888
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,859
I should go inside.

889
01:45:34,859 --> 01:45:36,220
It's past my bedtime.

890
01:45:37,579 --> 01:45:38,460
Good night, Toggle.

891
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:44,520
Where have I heard this voice before?

892
01:45:53,239 --> 01:45:53,960
Ben Starr.

893
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,399
Yeah, where have I heard this voice though?

894
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:56,439
Recently.

895
01:45:57,159 --> 01:46:20,359
The trailer?

896
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:21,560
Supplies from the capital.

897
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:29,130
It's got a familiar voice or a familiar way of speaking.

898
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:39,829
You took your time sampling the wearers, were you?

899
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:49,529
Yeah, I had the first person I looked up at.

900
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,770
I thought it was the same person, but it wasn't.

901
01:46:55,289 --> 01:46:55,770
Sounds good.

902
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:57,050
I like it.

903
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:19,130
You're missing lore pauses?

904
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:24,170
It's not going to give me lore right now.

905
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:26,649
No, no, no, it's not.

906
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:28,329
Guys, it doesn't give you spoilers.

907
01:47:28,329 --> 01:47:30,729
It just tells you what you should know by that point.

908
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:43,430
You don't get to look and see what this guy does two chapters from now.

909
01:47:44,619 --> 01:47:45,579
It doesn't work like that.

910
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:20,239
Uh-oh.

911
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,500
Oh, magical spells.

912
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,779
All right, get out there and just like...

913
01:48:32,729 --> 01:48:36,710
Joshua has a four-hit combo with ice spells.

914
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:49,479
I only knew his name was Joshua because I did the thing.

915
01:48:49,479 --> 01:48:50,039
I looked at it.

916
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:55,659
They're under attack.

917
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:59,500
I don't know who they are, but they've set light to half the castle.

918
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,340
I must get you to safety, Your Highness.

919
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:02,859
Very well.

920
01:49:03,979 --> 01:49:04,619
I'm ready.

921
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,260
Follow me, Your Highness.

922
01:49:07,899 --> 01:49:08,619
Wait, I actually...

923
01:49:08,619 --> 01:49:09,020
It is.

924
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:09,899
It's true.

925
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:11,819
I actually am going to play as this character now.

926
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:13,020
You guys thought I was full of shit.

927
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,619
I'm going to have like ice moves getting out of my hands.

928
01:49:15,579 --> 01:49:16,899
You thought I was full of shit?

929
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:18,829
Yeah.

930
01:49:19,689 --> 01:49:20,189
Really?

931
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:24,970
I think I used all of his fucking power.

932
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:25,470
All right.

933
01:49:26,029 --> 01:49:31,880
I just did 999, 999.

934
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:32,380
Damn it.

935
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:33,890
I'm ready.

936
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:55,880
So they are caster characters.

937
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,380
Okay.

938
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:01,069
The kid just cast fucking starlight.

939
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:05,149
Oh, starlight kid.

940
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,189
All right, let's do it.

941
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:16,739
Oh, yeah?

942
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,720
Do my duty.

943
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,159
Did I get in there?

944
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,109
This kid is strong.

945
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:39,199
Nice whiff.

946
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:40,479
I thought it was a range.

947
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:41,279
I thought it was range.

948
01:50:58,039 --> 01:50:59,079
Garaga is a heal.

949
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:01,239
I think I remember that.

950
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:04,840
9999 heal.

951
01:51:05,479 --> 01:51:10,899
Let's move.

952
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:32,720
All right, so I got that.

953
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:34,159
I can only do one.

954
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,359
I don't have a chain with it though.

955
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:36,880
Maybe I do if I don't land two.

956
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:47,739
This is bullshit.

957
01:51:49,479 --> 01:52:00,600
Anything going on down here?

958
01:52:09,369 --> 01:52:10,250
Is there a stealth kill?

959
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:20,489
Ha ha ha ha, idiot.

960
01:52:20,489 --> 01:52:21,289
Stupid idiot.

961
01:52:38,649 --> 01:52:39,149
Uh oh.

962
01:52:40,569 --> 01:52:41,529
That's not good.

963
01:52:41,529 --> 01:52:42,029
Tyler.

964
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:46,279
We just started to care about Tyler.

965
01:52:46,279 --> 01:52:47,079
This is not good.

966
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,640
I can save him.

967
01:53:01,449 --> 01:53:08,079
Sorry, you're going to be all right.

968
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:14,720
I'll hold them off.

969
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:30,750
Oh.

970
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:32,590
Oh.

971
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,000
It's you.

972
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,500
Why?

973
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,220
Joshua.

974
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,739
Come here.

975
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,300
Tyler.

976
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:42,510
You're hurt.

977
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:44,810
You'll survive.

978
01:53:45,869 --> 01:53:47,069
Thanks to his highness.

979
01:53:47,069 --> 01:53:48,350
It's all right, my lord.

980
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:50,109
I can only be three party members anyways.

981
01:53:50,909 --> 01:53:52,109
You guys go on ahead.

982
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:53,470
Figure it out later.

983
01:54:02,119 --> 01:54:03,560
Rescue the young prince.

984
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,739
Well done, Sir Wade.

985
01:54:05,739 --> 01:54:08,649
Your debt, soldier.

986
01:54:11,949 --> 01:54:12,829
Thank you.

987
01:54:12,829 --> 01:54:13,329
Your grace.

988
01:54:14,029 --> 01:54:22,239
How come there's never a fantasy character with a Boston accent?

989
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:23,920
That would be just wouldn't make any sense.

990
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,600
All right, you stay fucking here, kid.

991
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:28,479
You just chill out.

992
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:30,399
Do that cure shit on that guy.

993
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:31,439
Heal his fucking wounds.

994
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,680
I'll take everybody out.

995
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:36,800
We'll go out front and we'll just fuck these motherfuckers up.

996
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,760
Hey, can I get your car keys?

997
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,380
I just want to park it somewhere else

998
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,579
because there's like three people behind you.

999
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:45,039
Or in front of you.

1000
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,960
I don't want you to trap anybody.

1001
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,239
Do something, Elif.

1002
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,710
May the winds speed you to Rosaleth.

1003
01:54:52,510 --> 01:55:06,199
The north gate's up ahead.

1004
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,199
There are chocobos in the stables.

1005
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,039
Father, take Joshua and get to safety.

1006
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:15,130
No, I'm not going without you.

1007
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,810
You're supposed to be my shield.

1008
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:17,130
Remember?

1009
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:20,970
It'd be great to have that 9999 heal.

1010
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:22,489
I would love to take this kid.

1011
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:25,609
Which is why I'm going to hold the enemy here while you make your escape.

1012
01:55:26,409 --> 01:55:28,890
I will order our remaining forces to rally at the gate.

1013
01:55:29,529 --> 01:55:30,170
Now go.

1014
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:39,100
Do my duty.

1015
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:41,319
You must do your duty too.

1016
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,439
I know.

1017
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:52,680
You have to keep father safe.

1018
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:55,239
If I like this, would I like 15 as well?

1019
01:55:56,039 --> 01:56:04,319
Somebody just said you would like 15 if you like this.

1020
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:04,640
Maybe.

1021
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:10,880
You would like 14.

1022
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:29,930
Are we going for it?

1023
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:34,909
14 is pretty good.

1024
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,800
Well, I don't have to know anything, right?

1025
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:44,560
It's just its own video game.

1026
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:47,840
I don't need to know everything that happened in the last 15 games

1027
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,119
or the last 12 games or anything.

1028
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:53,960
I should...

1029
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,239
Okay, I got potions on there already.

1030
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:01,529
All right, here we go.

1031
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:07,319
All right.

1032
01:57:08,199 --> 01:57:15,609
Oh, dodge.

1033
01:57:15,609 --> 01:57:16,090
Wrong dodge.

1034
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:33,439
Stuck on the table.

1035
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:37,199
Everyone's dead.

1036
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:38,000
Don't forget to parry.

1037
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,229
I should probably learn how to parry on these guys.

1038
01:57:41,949 --> 01:57:45,340
I think he's trying to get away from me.

1039
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:50,510
I'll try parry.

1040
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:54,039
He said parry is hard.

1041
01:57:54,039 --> 01:57:54,680
Well, that's good.

1042
01:57:55,399 --> 01:58:00,220
It means insufficient inventory space.

1043
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,420
High potion used.

1044
01:58:03,789 --> 01:58:10,439
Do I have to get a bigger stash or bigger inventory eventually or something?

1045
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:34,300
This way you can't hold 99 potions and trivialize the game.

1046
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:40,380
Here's a big fight.

1047
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,119
Focus up.

1048
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,399
You got it.

1049
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,109
You try it.

1050
01:59:00,109 --> 01:59:00,430
Hold on.

1051
01:59:01,149 --> 01:59:02,619
Let's see.

1052
01:59:02,619 --> 01:59:03,020
Let's see.

1053
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:06,350
Right when you...

1054
01:59:07,069 --> 01:59:07,310
No, no.

1055
01:59:08,189 --> 01:59:08,670
Too early.

1056
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:14,840
Too early.

1057
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:29,869
I was practicing, dad.

1058
01:59:32,029 --> 01:59:33,550
No, wait, wait.

1059
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:34,350
Who is this?

1060
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:34,909
Who is this?

1061
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:36,670
I have the wrong character.

1062
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,710
I need my lore book.

1063
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:38,989
Uh-oh.

1064
01:59:38,989 --> 01:59:39,949
Fuck, who is this?

1065
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,119
Oh, shit.

1066
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,000
Let's get him.

1067
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:04,750
Oh, that hurt a lot.

1068
02:00:08,699 --> 02:00:10,140
Oh, that hurts a lot too.

1069
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:15,550
Oh, that hurt real bad.

1070
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:21,100
All right, I gotta get better.

1071
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:21,659
I gotta get better.

1072
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:22,300
I gotta get better.

1073
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,600
I gotta get way better than this.

1074
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,479
I gotta be better than this.

1075
02:00:41,579 --> 02:00:49,210
That's fine.

1076
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:49,529
Back up.

1077
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:57,149
I gotta parry that.

1078
02:00:57,789 --> 02:01:01,850
That didn't work.

1079
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:17,369
Parry.

1080
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:19,369
Is that right?

1081
02:01:19,369 --> 02:01:20,090
I don't think it was right.

1082
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:40,989
Oh, shit.

1083
02:01:40,989 --> 02:01:42,670
He's open.

1084
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,069
Is he?

1085
02:01:45,069 --> 02:01:45,949
I love that.

1086
02:01:45,949 --> 02:01:46,430
It's so...

1087
02:01:47,229 --> 02:01:49,550
It's just like dialing up to 100.

1088
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:50,350
Now, Clive.

1089
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:50,989
How about it?

1090
02:02:09,369 --> 02:02:10,649
I think he's spitting up.

1091
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:20,399
Whoa.

1092
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:36,920
Oh, he's got a combo.

1093
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:48,399
Send it.

1094
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:55,439
I forgot my cool combo.

1095
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:56,399
It was cool, I promise.

1096
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:26,000
Oh, dude, I'm so glad this game

1097
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,680
isn't coming out like next year.

1098
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:29,039
Do you know what I mean?

1099
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:29,600
Look at it.

1100
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,899
Night of the blinding dawn slain.

1101
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,170
That music is just...

1102
02:03:58,729 --> 02:03:59,770
All right, you know when you play a game

1103
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,130
and it's just, you know,

1104
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:03,449
the music is kind of going

1105
02:04:03,449 --> 02:04:04,810
and it fits and you're just like, yep.

1106
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:07,789
I almost play to the beat.

1107
02:04:07,789 --> 02:04:08,670
Do you guys do that too?

1108
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:20,090
I'm fine.

1109
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:28,510
So they sent in the Dragoons.

1110
02:04:29,149 --> 02:04:30,720
Imperial vipers.

1111
02:04:31,819 --> 02:04:33,659
Do they really mean to invade us?

1112
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:36,380
Yeah, June 22nd.

1113
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:36,859
Not yet.

1114
02:04:36,859 --> 02:04:38,060
For PS5, yeah.

1115
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:39,100
Their numbers were too few.

1116
02:04:40,409 --> 02:04:41,930
They were not here to take the castle.

1117
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:44,479
They were here to take heads.

1118
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,520
Our work is done.

1119
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:49,439
We should return to my father.

1120
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:51,680
My lord, look.

1121
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,420
We issued these sashes, but yesterday...

1122
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,500
You're saying I wonder how deep the skill system gets

1123
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,060
in the full game?

1124
02:04:59,100 --> 02:04:59,500
I don't know.

1125
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,140
That's a good question.

1126
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:02,619
Father and Joshua are in danger.

1127
02:05:02,619 --> 02:05:03,739
We must hurry.

1128
02:05:03,739 --> 02:05:04,539
Take your steed.

1129
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:13,210
What is that?

1130
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:29,949
You just mouth fuck you to me?

1131
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:45,310
I read lips.

1132
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:51,050
The dog is fine.

1133
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:53,369
Everybody was freaking out about that.

1134
02:05:57,399 --> 02:05:59,079
Your grace, is everyone safe?

1135
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:04,430
For the moment, we ride for Rosalith to rally our forces.

1136
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:07,390
I will need your help to see Joshua safely back to the capital.

1137
02:06:09,609 --> 02:06:10,569
On you get, Joshua.

1138
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,560
What the hell?

1139
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:21,560
What the fuck was that?

1140
02:06:22,199 --> 02:06:25,239
I'm sorry, your grace, but that won't be possible.

1141
02:06:27,229 --> 02:06:27,729
Hey.

1142
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:28,930
Oh.

1143
02:06:31,369 --> 02:06:31,869
Snakes!

1144
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:32,569
Stay back!

1145
02:06:32,569 --> 02:06:33,210
I'm warning you!

1146
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:33,930
Run, Joshua!

1147
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:34,430
Run!

1148
02:06:34,569 --> 02:06:35,069
No!

1149
02:06:35,449 --> 02:06:35,949
Hey!

1150
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:51,069
Oh, no.

1151
02:06:51,869 --> 02:06:53,310
I think we're gonna lose...

1152
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:55,920
I think we're gonna lose another one.

1153
02:06:56,720 --> 02:07:05,840
You must do your duty, too.

1154
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:11,100
Father safe.

1155
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:12,619
I have to.

1156
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:16,380
I had to.

1157
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:26,989
No!

1158
02:07:27,369 --> 02:07:27,869
I...

1159
02:07:28,329 --> 02:07:30,649
On you, Joshua.

1160
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:33,529
Oh, he...

1161
02:07:33,529 --> 02:07:34,029
Okay.

1162
02:07:34,569 --> 02:07:35,609
He's the phoenix.

1163
02:07:36,489 --> 02:07:39,069
He's the phoenix.

1164
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:10,960
He's...

1165
02:08:12,939 --> 02:08:13,439
Phoenix?

1166
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:20,090
Joshua!

1167
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:21,850
Oh, this is where we start here.

1168
02:08:22,649 --> 02:08:30,760
He's lost control.

1169
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:32,840
I have to do something.

1170
02:08:33,479 --> 02:08:34,359
I have to save him.

1171
02:08:34,359 --> 02:08:34,859
No!

1172
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:35,720
My lord.

1173
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:36,220
Fall back!

1174
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:44,430
Oh.

1175
02:08:45,289 --> 02:08:47,529
Ow.

1176
02:08:47,529 --> 02:08:51,409
Oh, no.

1177
02:08:51,409 --> 02:08:51,909
Chocobo!

1178
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:56,359
Thank you, God.

1179
02:08:56,359 --> 02:08:57,159
You saved my life.

1180
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:04,720
I'm gonna fit and run.

1181
02:09:06,119 --> 02:09:06,619
Please.

1182
02:09:08,909 --> 02:09:13,869
Joshua.

1183
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:15,050
Are you in pain?

1184
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:23,760
You're his shield.

1185
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:26,619
Do your duty.

1186
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:29,300
What?

1187
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:31,600
Save him.

1188
02:09:35,869 --> 02:09:36,369
My lord.

1189
02:10:01,479 --> 02:10:02,840
Second icon of fire.

1190
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:05,279
That's impossible.

1191
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:08,619
Whoa!

1192
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:09,420
Wait, did I...

1193
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:10,140
Wait, what?

1194
02:10:10,939 --> 02:10:12,060
Oh, my God.

1195
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,460
I need to check the lore.

1196
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:15,500
I have to check the lore.

1197
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:16,399
Who?

1198
02:10:16,539 --> 02:10:17,039
Who?

1199
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:17,819
What happened?

1200
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:22,300
Firstborn son of Archduke Elwyn, ruler of Rosaria,

1201
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:26,619
through all expected him to inherit the phoenix's flames and awaken as its dominant,

1202
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:29,739
destiny instead chose his younger brother Joshua to bear that burden.

1203
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:31,819
In search of a role of his own,

1204
02:10:31,819 --> 02:10:34,619
Clive dedicated himself to mastering the blade

1205
02:10:34,619 --> 02:10:37,819
and his practice paid off when he was appointed first shield of Rosaria.

1206
02:10:37,819 --> 02:10:39,039
Okay.

1207
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:46,569
Tasked to guard the phoenix and blessed with the ability to wield a part of his fire.

1208
02:10:46,569 --> 02:10:47,069
Okay.

1209
02:10:47,689 --> 02:11:01,680
Do I actually get to walk around

1210
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,119
and play as this character?

1211
02:11:16,859 --> 02:11:17,359
And this is...

1212
02:11:32,729 --> 02:11:33,689
What the fuck?

1213
02:11:34,409 --> 02:11:34,909
Okay.

1214
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:37,930
So, we're do...

1215
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:38,430
We are...

1216
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:45,840
Embodying the phoenix.

1217
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:48,159
The following commands are available when playing as the phoenix.

1218
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:49,840
Fire, aim, and evade.

1219
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:52,479
When your opponent is directly within your sights,

1220
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:53,680
the targeting circle will expand.

1221
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:54,960
That is the time to fire.

1222
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,260
Okay.

1223
02:12:02,409 --> 02:12:03,770
Wait, I have to actually aim.

1224
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:30,819
Here we go.

1225
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:46,279
We both go horizontal on a 2D plane.

1226
02:12:46,279 --> 02:12:47,239
It just goes...

1227
02:12:47,239 --> 02:12:49,239
3, 2, 1, fight!

1228
02:12:57,819 --> 02:12:58,539
Uh oh.

1229
02:12:58,539 --> 02:12:59,039
Okay.

1230
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:15,079
All right, I think I'm gonna get...

1231
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:15,880
Here we go.

1232
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:18,930
Oh!

1233
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,800
All right, when he glows like that's when I have to dodge.

1234
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:31,319
Here it comes.

1235
02:13:32,199 --> 02:13:33,000
No, not yet.

1236
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:44,699
Well, I'm shooting a lot of fireballs too.

1237
02:13:44,699 --> 02:13:45,739
It's not just him.

1238
02:14:15,739 --> 02:14:16,239
Shoot him!

1239
02:14:16,779 --> 02:14:33,039
All right, I gotta be ready to evade.

1240
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:33,600
Here it comes.

1241
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:37,390
Oh, that was actually pretty close.

1242
02:14:37,390 --> 02:14:50,800
Stop jumping around!

1243
02:14:51,359 --> 02:14:53,819
Do I have to dodge that?

1244
02:14:58,439 --> 02:14:59,399
Where is he?

1245
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:00,779
Jesus.

1246
02:15:01,479 --> 02:15:05,069
Oh my god, dude.

1247
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:27,949
Now we're on the offensive.

1248
02:15:27,949 --> 02:15:28,449
All right.

1249
02:15:30,350 --> 02:15:35,949
I love the icons.

1250
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:39,930
The top left and top right.

1251
02:15:40,649 --> 02:15:54,189
Oh, I am shooting a million fireballs right now.

1252
02:15:59,930 --> 02:16:00,430
Sorry.

1253
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:03,149
I don't think I'm getting away from this.

1254
02:16:04,029 --> 02:16:15,630
Oh my god, I was so paying no attention.

1255
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:16,909
I was just spamming and I wasn't...

1256
02:16:16,909 --> 02:16:25,600
I forgot I had to actually dodge.

1257
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,399
Damnation?

1258
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:28,380
In...

1259
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:29,800
How many seconds?

1260
02:16:39,659 --> 02:16:40,459
Hellfire?

1261
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:48,829
Uh oh.

1262
02:16:48,909 --> 02:16:49,469
Dude, he just...

1263
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:50,510
He just...

1264
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:52,930
Wait.

1265
02:16:56,010 --> 02:16:57,370
What is going on right now?

1266
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:58,729
I mean, it's fucking awesome.

1267
02:16:58,729 --> 02:16:59,930
But what is happening?

1268
02:17:00,649 --> 02:17:08,399
Okay.

1269
02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:11,229
I should have done a lore check.

1270
02:17:11,229 --> 02:17:15,760
Like, that was kind of like

1271
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,840
when a company does an E3 presentation

1272
02:17:18,909 --> 02:17:20,590
and it's like, look at this game that we've got!

1273
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:22,670
Our E3 presentation!

1274
02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:25,520
That actually happened in the game.

1275
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:27,610
That happened in the game.

1276
02:17:28,409 --> 02:17:28,909
Here.

1277
02:17:31,399 --> 02:17:34,120
We got to see like an E3 presentation

1278
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:42,030
that actually made it through into the video game.

1279
02:17:42,030 --> 02:17:42,829
That was fucking cool.

1280
02:17:52,399 --> 02:17:53,120
Hashtag ad?

1281
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:54,399
Yes, of course hashtag ad.

1282
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:55,920
But the game is fucking phenomenal.

1283
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:56,420
Okay.

1284
02:18:04,719 --> 02:18:06,319
I'm having a ton of fun.

1285
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:07,440
I want to play way more of this.

1286
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:12,079
Combat was really fun.

1287
02:18:14,969 --> 02:18:15,770
I think I could get in...

1288
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:16,889
I think I could actually get into it.

1289
02:18:29,659 --> 02:18:32,059
Just the fighting is just so much different

1290
02:18:32,059 --> 02:18:34,379
than what I've ever played with Final Fantasy.

1291
02:18:36,649 --> 02:18:37,149
Round two?

1292
02:18:49,049 --> 02:18:50,010
What the fuck?

1293
02:18:50,729 --> 02:18:51,690
This is awful.

1294
02:18:53,899 --> 02:18:54,700
This is awful.

1295
02:19:12,139 --> 02:19:12,860
What is going on?

1296
02:19:16,239 --> 02:19:16,739
Stop it!

1297
02:19:17,979 --> 02:19:20,350
Stop it!

1298
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:21,309
I swore!

1299
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:28,030
I will beat you!

1300
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:30,559
Beat you!

1301
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:51,549
Wait, what?

1302
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:55,360
Is the dog?

1303
02:19:56,319 --> 02:20:08,879
Holy shit!

1304
02:20:18,139 --> 02:20:19,579
I'll kill you!

1305
02:20:19,579 --> 02:20:40,959
I can't kill you!

1306
02:20:40,959 --> 02:20:44,670
Damn.

1307
02:20:44,670 --> 02:20:48,250
Please do a lore check, please.

1308
02:20:48,250 --> 02:20:49,129
Oh, we...

1309
02:20:49,129 --> 02:21:02,159
Sorry, I missed it.

1310
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:03,040
When we started here,

1311
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:05,040
I was like, all right,

1312
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:06,399
I'm not sure where we're going with it.

1313
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:13,790
But I was not expecting any of that.

1314
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:16,729
That we're just going to be as a band of

1315
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:18,430
adventurers.

1316
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:43,049
Can't believe it.

1317
02:21:54,319 --> 02:21:58,920
Make sure to walk over very

1318
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,440
evilly, too, while you're at it.

1319
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:14,760
Kill him?

1320
02:22:38,860 --> 02:22:39,819
What the fuck?

1321
02:22:39,819 --> 02:22:42,059
Oh my god, dude.

1322
02:22:42,059 --> 02:22:42,860
What the hell?

1323
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:46,120
You all didn't think we were going here.

1324
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:47,000
None of you did.

1325
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,120
None of you did.

1326
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:49,079
Chin up, lad.

1327
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:49,879
None of you did.

1328
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,760
You're going to be a soldier.

1329
02:22:53,879 --> 02:22:54,379
Why?

1330
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,420
What?

1331
02:22:55,959 --> 02:23:06,649
My goodness.

1332
02:23:06,649 --> 02:23:07,149
Okay.

1333
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:11,610
Well, I'm very interested.

1334
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:15,100
Thank you for watching this.

1335
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:15,659
Yeah.

1336
02:23:15,659 --> 02:23:17,870
Thank you for playing.

1337
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:19,629
You've completed the Final Fantasy XVI demo,

1338
02:23:19,629 --> 02:23:22,639
but there's still much more story to tell.

1339
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:25,760
You'd like to learn more of Clive and the dominance.

1340
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,680
Please consider purchasing the main game.

1341
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:33,309
Consider me considering.

1342
02:23:33,309 --> 02:23:34,270
You know what I mean?

1343
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:39,209
That was great.

1344
02:23:39,209 --> 02:23:41,370
So I will absolutely be playing this again.

1345
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:43,229
You'll see it again.

1346
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:48,719
I wish I could kind of keep playing right now.

1347
02:23:51,680 --> 02:24:02,940
When does this come out?

1348
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:03,899
Playthrough data saved.

1349
02:24:03,899 --> 02:24:05,979
Playthrough data can be carried over to the main game,

1350
02:24:05,979 --> 02:24:08,860
allowing you to continue from where you left off in the demo.

1351
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:12,139
Demo playthrough data cannot be loaded in the demo version.

1352
02:24:12,139 --> 02:24:13,340
To play the demo again,

1353
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:20,760
you must select new game from the title screen.

1354
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,360
I have to pee so bad.

1355
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:23,559
I will be right back.

1356
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:26,239
But that's great.

1357
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:28,399
Again, yes, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.

1358
02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:30,559
Square Enix, thanks for sponsoring the stream.

1359
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:32,239
And obviously Final Fantasy XVI.

1360
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:36,600
Demo, you can go get it right now.

1361
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:40,600
It's a free demo on the PS5 store.

1362
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:44,620
If you want to check it out for yourself, you can.

1363
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:45,420
That was great.

1364
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,209
I liked it a lot.

1365
02:24:47,209 --> 02:24:48,329
Don't save the game.

1366
02:24:48,329 --> 02:24:48,969
Don't save.

1367
02:24:48,969 --> 02:24:49,690
Don't save.

1368
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:55,120
Don't save.

1369
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:55,840
Should I save?

1370
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,200
No, no, I should save, right?

1371
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:57,680
I will.

1372
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:58,079
I gotta pee.

1373
02:24:58,079 --> 02:24:58,559
I'll be right back.

1374
02:24:58,559 --> 02:24:59,360
Give me one second.

1375
02:24:59,360 --> 02:27:02,360
Okay, I am back.

1376
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:04,250
So there's more to the demo.

1377
02:27:04,889 --> 02:27:07,020
What more is there to do?

1378
02:27:15,209 --> 02:27:16,329
More to do.

1379
02:27:16,329 --> 02:27:20,120
Okay, so I got it saved.

1380
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:23,040
Just kind of back up.

1381
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:26,219
Purchase from PlayStation Store.

1382
02:27:26,219 --> 02:27:28,219
Digital Deluxe or the base game.

1383
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:36,540
Okay, well, there's another mid-game mission.

1384
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:37,180
Really?

1385
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:42,000
Go back to the title screen?

1386
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,040
Wait, are people...

1387
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:43,760
I think that's the end.

1388
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:45,520
I don't think there's anything else.

1389
02:27:46,239 --> 02:27:48,729
I'll go back to the title screen.

1390
02:27:48,729 --> 02:27:50,409
Ah, there is.

1391
02:27:50,409 --> 02:27:51,129
There is.

1392
02:27:51,129 --> 02:27:52,649
Okay, there is more to look at.

1393
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:54,889
The iconic challenge has been unlocked

1394
02:27:54,889 --> 02:27:56,329
and is now available from the title menu.

1395
02:27:56,329 --> 02:27:58,649
In this special mode set later in the game.

1396
02:27:58,649 --> 02:28:01,000
Clive has been equipped with the feats and abilities

1397
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,680
of three unique icons.

1398
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:05,260
The Phoenix, Garuda, and Titan.

1399
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,680
To allow you to get a better feel

1400
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:09,719
of Final Fantasy XVI's exciting battle system.

1401
02:28:09,719 --> 02:28:12,190
Well, we're doing that.

1402
02:28:12,829 --> 02:28:15,659
Okay, note.

1403
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:19,899
This challenge was created specifically for this demo

1404
02:28:19,899 --> 02:28:21,340
and its features differ slightly

1405
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:22,860
from what appears in the final game.

1406
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:25,260
Gear, items, abilities are not representative

1407
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:26,299
of what normally...

1408
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:28,379
What are normally available to Clive

1409
02:28:28,379 --> 02:28:30,379
during this part of the story.

1410
02:28:30,379 --> 02:28:31,629
Makes sense.

1411
02:28:34,489 --> 02:28:36,090
The world map and journal have been removed

1412
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:36,969
from the main menu.

1413
02:28:36,969 --> 02:28:39,209
Save, autosave, and load functionality is unavailable.

1414
02:28:39,930 --> 02:28:42,649
So, this is exclusive for the demo

1415
02:28:42,649 --> 02:28:43,930
and it's not going to spoil anything.

1416
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:44,409
That's cool.

1417
02:28:44,969 --> 02:28:47,159
I think we already know this, right?

1418
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:50,639
Do we know this?

1419
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:54,520
We know this, right?

1420
02:28:55,399 --> 02:28:56,280
Is there spoilers here?

1421
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:59,579
This is new.

1422
02:28:59,579 --> 02:29:01,500
It will spoil, but just a small section.

1423
02:29:02,139 --> 02:29:06,569
There's some story, but we don't know broader context.

1424
02:29:06,569 --> 02:29:07,370
There's spoilers?

1425
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:08,489
Very mild spoilers?

1426
02:29:08,489 --> 02:29:08,989
Okay.

1427
02:29:09,370 --> 02:29:13,770
Well, it said they made it specifically for the demo.

1428
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:16,459
I'm imagining it's an early part of the game.

1429
02:29:17,020 --> 02:29:18,139
Yeah, okay.

1430
02:29:18,139 --> 02:29:19,739
All right, we join the two as they begin

1431
02:29:19,739 --> 02:29:22,700
their infiltration of Chyre Norvent,

1432
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,219
an ancient stronghold wherein his brother

1433
02:29:24,219 --> 02:29:26,459
is supposed to kill her, a second dominant of fire.

1434
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:28,299
He's said to be held by an elite party of

1435
02:29:28,860 --> 02:29:33,020
Weloder Knights, commanded by Benedicta Harmon.

1436
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:36,809
Okay, so 13 years have passed since their tragic events

1437
02:29:36,809 --> 02:29:38,170
which saw Clive robbed of his brother,

1438
02:29:38,170 --> 02:29:39,129
his father, and his home.

1439
02:29:39,850 --> 02:29:41,120
Okay.

1440
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:43,799
He runs his freedom in the hands of a man named Sid

1441
02:29:43,799 --> 02:29:46,120
who agrees to aid our hero in his search for answers.

1442
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:46,840
Okay.

1443
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:49,069
I think it's spoiling what we just saw

1444
02:29:49,069 --> 02:29:52,030
and maybe like a little tiny little snippet.

1445
02:29:52,030 --> 02:29:57,659
I would be surprised if they would spoil something in a demo.

1446
02:29:57,659 --> 02:30:00,299
And we're probably gonna get some pretty out of context things.

1447
02:30:17,149 --> 02:30:17,629
Lore check?

1448
02:30:17,629 --> 02:30:18,829
No, I'm not doing a lore check.

1449
02:30:18,829 --> 02:30:19,329
Not now.

1450
02:30:24,909 --> 02:30:26,670
They've also said this won't be exactly the same

1451
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:27,309
as the game.

1452
02:30:27,309 --> 02:30:28,430
It'll be changed.

1453
02:30:28,430 --> 02:30:29,549
That's actually really smart.

1454
02:30:30,190 --> 02:30:31,469
That's a smart thing.

1455
02:30:31,469 --> 02:30:32,909
Like, oh, hey, yeah, we're just making it.

1456
02:30:32,909 --> 02:30:34,510
The cut scenes just different

1457
02:30:34,510 --> 02:30:36,909
and the characters are not even the fucking same probably.

1458
02:30:36,909 --> 02:30:38,270
We just, we just made this up.

1459
02:30:39,309 --> 02:30:57,020
Okay.

1460
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:57,979
Well, that's fucking awesome.

1461
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:04,040
I don't know the context, but I now know context

1462
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:06,680
that dog is playable character in game.

1463
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:09,159
Now, now we're really cooking.

1464
02:31:09,159 --> 02:31:13,309
As L to the cycle between currently attuned icons

1465
02:31:13,309 --> 02:31:17,120
in real time, cool down times for iconic abilities

1466
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,639
are displayed around the corresponding icon.

1467
02:31:18,639 --> 02:31:19,139
Okay.

1468
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:21,809
So everything has to cool down so you can switch.

1469
02:31:26,190 --> 02:31:27,069
He's everywhere.

1470
02:31:27,069 --> 02:31:28,590
That actor is everywhere now.

1471
02:31:29,149 --> 02:31:36,979
I hear him every fucking day, but he's got a,

1472
02:31:36,979 --> 02:31:39,059
he's got a great voice, right?

1473
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:40,100
All right.

1474
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:48,879
So what I can change to, how do I swap?

1475
02:31:52,530 --> 02:31:54,290
Oh, I see what's going on.

1476
02:31:55,010 --> 02:31:56,020
All right.

1477
02:31:56,020 --> 02:31:57,459
Let's do deadly embrace.

1478
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,139
He's gonna be great in this game

1479
02:32:19,139 --> 02:32:24,750
to I can already tell they're all empty.

1480
02:32:28,659 --> 02:32:34,559
They're all empty.

1481
02:32:34,559 --> 02:32:41,170
Sid, this gate needs some help.

1482
02:32:41,729 --> 02:32:45,870
You can still skip as an adult.

1483
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:46,370
Yes.

1484
02:32:53,840 --> 02:33:03,680
Oh, wait, there's more to the demo.

1485
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:04,180
Yeah.

1486
02:33:04,639 --> 02:33:06,959
So there is a, we didn't know this until the very end,

1487
02:33:06,959 --> 02:33:10,239
but there's like a little snippet from the middle of the game

1488
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:11,280
that they tried to make sure

1489
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:12,799
there wasn't very many spoilers in it.

1490
02:33:12,799 --> 02:33:14,559
And it's just, Hey, take a look at some more

1491
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:16,239
of the combat shit for like a minute or two

1492
02:33:16,239 --> 02:33:17,040
while you have a minute.

1493
02:33:48,530 --> 02:33:50,049
What about these other moves?

1494
02:33:50,049 --> 02:33:55,649
Let's just do a limit break.

1495
02:33:55,649 --> 02:33:56,149
Fuck it.

1496
02:34:13,659 --> 02:34:15,659
I thought he just burped really loud.

1497
02:34:15,659 --> 02:34:16,780
That was a dog growling.

1498
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:29,020
Devil May Cry designers chops are showing here.

1499
02:34:30,979 --> 02:34:33,299
Yeah, it's going to be fun.

1500
02:34:33,299 --> 02:34:35,139
This tour only leads to more royalists.

1501
02:34:35,940 --> 02:34:37,139
We'd better find another one.

1502
02:34:39,299 --> 02:34:40,020
Read the abilities.

1503
02:34:42,129 --> 02:34:44,129
Rising flames, scarlet cyclone.

1504
02:34:45,889 --> 02:34:48,129
Oh, it's been quickly creating a ring of fire.

1505
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:50,059
Look at that.

1506
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:52,420
What?

1507
02:34:52,959 --> 02:34:55,760
Oh, I am pogging in real life.

1508
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:03,180
Gouge.

1509
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:05,500
Some twin claws that relentlessly tear at a target

1510
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:06,540
can be used in midair.

1511
02:35:08,739 --> 02:35:10,500
Rising attacks, breaking all enemies within range.

1512
02:35:11,139 --> 02:35:15,659
Punch forward, hold button to wind up attack,

1513
02:35:15,659 --> 02:35:16,940
further increasing potency.

1514
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:17,579
Oh, okay.

1515
02:35:17,579 --> 02:35:17,979
So you do it.

1516
02:35:17,979 --> 02:35:19,340
Let it go in the red, probably.

1517
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:34,260
Where are we going?

1518
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:37,219
I'm just not that one, obviously.

1519
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:41,780
Am I going the right way?

1520
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:47,059
Am I going the wrong way?

1521
02:35:47,059 --> 02:35:50,420
Okay.

1522
02:35:56,459 --> 02:35:57,659
Just not that way.

1523
02:36:04,819 --> 02:36:05,860
It runs pretty well.

1524
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:09,020
I have the framerate mode turned on,

1525
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:12,260
but it seems to be pretty clean.

1526
02:36:13,139 --> 02:36:15,250
Where am I going?

1527
02:36:15,889 --> 02:36:21,409
How come my screen is darker than the stream screen?

1528
02:36:21,409 --> 02:36:21,909
I don't know why.

1529
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:23,260
Hold up.

1530
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:23,739
Oh, right.

1531
02:36:23,739 --> 02:36:25,819
If I have the mode where I can see things.

1532
02:36:26,459 --> 02:36:31,809
Oh, it is right here.

1533
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:39,309
Use the animal instinct.

1534
02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:47,649
Can you please pet the dog?

1535
02:36:48,450 --> 02:36:49,809
Find out.

1536
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:56,030
Probably not in a combat scenario.

1537
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,309
Holy shit.

1538
02:37:15,309 --> 02:37:16,989
Whoa, there's more to the, there's a second part.

1539
02:37:17,709 --> 02:37:19,709
They all were like flying in like, they like,

1540
02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:20,989
I can't even talk.

1541
02:37:23,309 --> 02:37:33,940
I'm gonna try the phoenix move.

1542
02:37:36,219 --> 02:37:36,620
Distance.

1543
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:41,760
Cool.

1544
02:37:46,030 --> 02:37:48,430
Why bright and magic ash?

1545
02:37:49,069 --> 02:37:53,299
Did I miss any items or anything?

1546
02:37:53,860 --> 02:37:59,409
Can we get a bald cam, please?

1547
02:38:00,450 --> 02:38:01,250
Maybe on your birthday.

1548
02:38:01,809 --> 02:38:21,219
Oh, you can really chain stuff together.

1549
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:24,190
That's enough.

1550
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:27,500
All right.

1551
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:28,860
The chains are going to be fun.

1552
02:38:31,229 --> 02:38:33,620
I think I got to turn my brightness up a little.

1553
02:38:34,899 --> 02:38:38,780
Let's see.

1554
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:40,129
Can I do it from here?

1555
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:51,020
Camera settings, graphic settings.

1556
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:51,659
Screen brightness.

1557
02:38:52,379 --> 02:38:59,520
All right.

1558
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,379
That's better.

1559
02:39:02,379 --> 02:39:02,860
There we go.

1560
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:07,979
What about you have a light?

1561
02:39:07,979 --> 02:39:08,860
You have a light.

1562
02:39:08,860 --> 02:39:09,340
I can wait.

1563
02:39:09,899 --> 02:39:10,860
Can I turn the light on?

1564
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:11,819
I have a light move.

1565
02:39:12,379 --> 02:39:12,879
Do I?

1566
02:39:13,500 --> 02:39:18,799
How do I do the light move?

1567
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:26,000
I don't think so.

1568
02:39:31,659 --> 02:39:32,780
It's on the phoenix.

1569
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:33,280
Oh, okay.

1570
02:39:38,899 --> 02:39:39,860
Wait, that's a block.

1571
02:39:40,739 --> 02:39:42,559
I wonder how much it blocks.

1572
02:39:55,229 --> 02:39:55,729
Damn.

1573
02:40:04,639 --> 02:40:05,040
Shit.

1574
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:05,540
I missed it.

1575
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:22,209
Just 5,000 damage.

1576
02:40:22,209 --> 02:40:22,709
All right.

1577
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:24,920
There, boy.

1578
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:26,819
Sicko Togo.

1579
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:35,329
That was a good parry.

1580
02:40:38,899 --> 02:40:40,420
Sicko Togo.

1581
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:46,920
Wait.

1582
02:40:47,219 --> 02:40:55,590
Oh, it's turning.

1583
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:56,090
Woo.

1584
02:41:03,479 --> 02:41:04,629
This guy.

1585
02:41:04,629 --> 02:41:05,989
Yeah, this guy does not stand a chance.

1586
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:10,920
Crush him.

1587
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:22,520
Any item?

1588
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:24,799
This map feels nostalgic.

1589
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:30,870
There are probably some nods to the previous games or previous things.

1590
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:31,989
There usually is, isn't there?

1591
02:41:31,989 --> 02:41:36,520
I don't know what hit them.

1592
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:37,399
Aver of fire.

1593
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:51,889
All is after them.

1594
02:41:51,969 --> 02:41:56,159
My birthday is on August 2nd.

1595
02:41:56,159 --> 02:41:57,360
Please do a bald cam.

1596
02:41:57,360 --> 02:41:58,399
I swear I'll...

1597
02:41:58,399 --> 02:41:58,899
Okay.

1598
02:42:02,049 --> 02:42:05,170
Attacking an opponent from the front while it is guarding will deal no damage.

1599
02:42:05,170 --> 02:42:07,010
Circle to the rear to penetrate its defenses.

1600
02:42:07,729 --> 02:42:11,969
Certain basic abilities such as Burning Blade and Charged Magic,

1601
02:42:11,969 --> 02:42:15,170
as well as iconic abilities such as the Phoenix Rising Flames,

1602
02:42:15,170 --> 02:42:17,809
can instantly break an opponent's guard when delivered from the front.

1603
02:42:17,809 --> 02:42:18,309
Okay.

1604
02:42:18,850 --> 02:42:19,979
Good to know.

1605
02:42:30,549 --> 02:42:33,909
Back it up.

1606
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:48,709
New enemies coming up?

1607
02:42:48,709 --> 02:42:49,209
Whatever.

1608
02:42:59,209 --> 02:42:59,930
Let me try this.

1609
02:43:06,739 --> 02:43:07,379
All right, I can't...

1610
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:11,299
When the game comes out, I think I'm doing the titanic stuff.

1611
02:43:12,180 --> 02:43:13,989
Feels really strong.

1612
02:43:14,549 --> 02:43:29,239
Anybody else?

1613
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:43,270
I don't know who to swing at, but...

1614
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:55,129
Jesus.

1615
02:44:06,139 --> 02:44:08,700
So what are the two bars under my health?

1616
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:17,450
I wonder.

1617
02:44:17,450 --> 02:44:23,129
Oops.

1618
02:44:23,129 --> 02:44:24,170
That's Limit Break.

1619
02:44:24,170 --> 02:44:24,670
Ah.

1620
02:44:28,969 --> 02:44:39,139
All right, time for a Limit Break.

1621
02:44:39,139 --> 02:44:46,170
I gotta get used to that.

1622
02:44:46,170 --> 02:44:50,010
You're playing the game on easy right now?

1623
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:51,370
You have the rings on?

1624
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:51,850
It's okay.

1625
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:55,850
I think they put them on to make it so you can see just how wild some of the combos can get.

1626
02:45:38,059 --> 02:45:40,059
Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?

1627
02:45:40,870 --> 02:45:42,149
You mean where's the dominant?

1628
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:45,750
Well, he shall be requiring his services indefinitely.

1629
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:48,149
I don't know who this is, but I'm sure we'll find out.

1630
02:45:48,149 --> 02:45:49,270
Come back to me, Sedolphus.

1631
02:45:49,270 --> 02:45:49,989
I need you.

1632
02:45:50,549 --> 02:45:52,870
Think of all the things we can create together.

1633
02:45:54,469 --> 02:45:56,229
The world that we can build.

1634
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:58,069
You need me.

1635
02:45:59,989 --> 02:46:01,750
Your king needs me.

1636
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:03,510
I'm all for building a new world.

1637
02:46:04,629 --> 02:46:05,590
Just not his.

1638
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:07,190
Oh, the dog is also agreeing.

1639
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:09,909
His dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.

1640
02:46:10,709 --> 02:46:10,870
Yeah.

1641
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:12,309
I want no part of him.

1642
02:46:12,309 --> 02:46:13,510
We don't want anything to do with you.

1643
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:16,709
He's the one who saved you, and this is how you speak of him.

1644
02:46:16,709 --> 02:46:18,389
Have you no shred of loyalty?

1645
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:24,889
To a leader who'd use me like he uses you.

1646
02:46:25,850 --> 02:46:28,250
You know nothing of me, Sedolphus.

1647
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:28,809
You're right.

1648
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:33,479
I don't know who you are anymore or what you want.

1649
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:37,700
I only know what you used to say.

1650
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:40,940
That you were tired of running.

1651
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:45,190
That you just wanted to be free.

1652
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:45,989
Free of it all.

1653
02:46:45,989 --> 02:46:46,709
Yeah, the demo is over.

1654
02:46:46,709 --> 02:46:50,790
This is just like extra little content.

1655
02:46:50,790 --> 02:46:54,790
What made you think you had to sacrifice who you were to get what you wanted?

1656
02:46:56,219 --> 02:46:57,020
Sacrifice?

1657
02:46:57,659 --> 02:47:01,739
I use my talents to my advantage, and you would tell me there is shame in that?

1658
02:47:01,739 --> 02:47:05,979
If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?

1659
02:47:05,979 --> 02:47:07,979
Arousing speech, Lord Commander.

1660
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:11,420
I was a fool to believe you might have changed.

1661
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:15,379
The only person I feel sorry for is you.

1662
02:47:17,739 --> 02:47:19,659
I can't do this anymore.

1663
02:47:26,409 --> 02:47:32,459
If you would stand between our liege and his dream, then you leave me no choice.

1664
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:36,219
Goodbye, Sedolphus.

1665
02:47:48,969 --> 02:47:57,579
No, he's getting in.

1666
02:47:57,579 --> 02:47:59,819
He's going to stand like a magical electricity.

1667
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:16,709
They all have like superpowers in this game.

1668
02:48:16,709 --> 02:48:19,690
It's just wild.

1669
02:48:53,370 --> 02:48:54,250
Is it my turn?

1670
02:48:55,129 --> 02:48:59,000
I think it's my turn.

1671
02:49:06,309 --> 02:49:06,950
Finish them.

1672
02:49:09,930 --> 02:49:16,420
Well, Sid.

1673
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,200
Okay.

1674
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:32,709
Super move incoming.

1675
02:49:33,430 --> 02:49:45,780
I'm going for a limit break right after this.

1676
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:59,950
Jesus.

1677
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:07,479
6,300 damage.

1678
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:12,350
That hurt.

1679
02:50:18,459 --> 02:50:19,579
I'm getting combo'd.

1680
02:50:33,979 --> 02:50:34,479
Again.

1681
02:50:47,559 --> 02:50:48,520
Sickom Torgal.

1682
02:50:49,479 --> 02:50:58,569
Those actually aren't...

1683
02:50:58,569 --> 02:50:59,770
Those are not easy to hit.

1684
02:51:00,489 --> 02:51:21,290
Do not stand in that.

1685
02:51:21,850 --> 02:51:25,719
I got...

1686
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:35,459
There's one down.

1687
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:47,860
She doesn't look happy, Torgal.

1688
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:48,920
Come on.

1689
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:50,600
Oh my goodness.

1690
02:51:54,010 --> 02:51:56,600
I got hit by that.

1691
02:51:57,159 --> 02:52:03,180
This has got to be the end right here.

1692
02:52:07,479 --> 02:52:07,979
This time.

1693
02:52:16,819 --> 02:52:17,620
All right, die!

1694
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:18,420
You're finished.

1695
02:52:21,079 --> 02:52:21,579
Okay.

1696
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:27,450
I had the rings on.

1697
02:52:27,450 --> 02:52:28,329
It's fine.

1698
02:52:28,329 --> 02:52:29,049
That was still fun.

1699
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:31,930
Level 13.

1700
02:52:31,930 --> 02:52:33,450
So that's not that much further.

1701
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:34,579
What are we?

1702
02:52:34,579 --> 02:52:35,940
Level six or seven or something?

1703
02:52:41,319 --> 02:52:41,819
Crafting.

1704
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:53,879
Is this the full version?

1705
02:52:54,440 --> 02:52:55,639
This is not the full version.

1706
02:52:55,639 --> 02:52:56,920
This is part of the demo.

1707
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:00,440
When you beat the demo, you can come back and do this little dungeon area.

1708
02:53:00,440 --> 02:53:02,760
It's like a little snippet of the game.

1709
02:53:11,659 --> 02:53:12,940
Why are you doing this to us?

1710
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:15,899
What, like showing you a fucking cool ass game?

1711
02:53:15,899 --> 02:53:17,819
You have to wait a little bit longer?

1712
02:53:38,090 --> 02:53:39,850
You can't afford to let them leave.

1713
02:53:40,409 --> 02:53:42,489
Remember, she has wings, you don't.

1714
02:53:43,129 --> 02:53:44,139
What about you?

1715
02:53:45,610 --> 02:53:47,049
Before or after I catch my breath.

1716
02:53:47,049 --> 02:53:47,610
I'll be fine.

1717
02:53:48,170 --> 02:53:49,450
It's the demo, for God's sake.

1718
02:53:50,250 --> 02:53:52,459
I'm not gonna do a main character death in the demo.

1719
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:54,700
What, are you out of your mind?

1720
02:53:54,700 --> 02:53:55,500
Come on, Torgal.

1721
02:53:56,139 --> 02:54:02,069
It's just the demo.

1722
02:54:02,069 --> 02:54:03,510
Can't die in the demo, you know?

1723
02:54:04,149 --> 02:54:06,889
We've already seen the main game.

1724
02:54:06,889 --> 02:54:09,129
He actually has a death scene right here, but they replaced it.

1725
02:54:31,190 --> 02:54:32,389
She must be here somewhere.

1726
02:54:33,270 --> 02:54:35,829
Dude, they've killed like 50 people in the demo.

1727
02:54:36,149 --> 02:54:38,420
Yeah, that's true.

1728
02:54:50,659 --> 02:54:52,979
But were they lore characters?

1729
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:56,139
They kind of were.

1730
02:55:02,709 --> 02:55:09,299
So some opponents will cast cure spells to heal their allies.

1731
02:55:09,299 --> 02:55:11,909
Defeat these spellcasters first to prevent drawn out battles.

1732
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:18,700
Or I could just smush everybody.

1733
02:55:26,540 --> 02:55:27,579
Ooh, okay.

1734
02:55:27,579 --> 02:55:30,520
I killed the caster last.

1735
02:55:31,399 --> 02:55:48,629
Take the rings off?

1736
02:55:50,659 --> 02:55:51,219
It's all right.

1737
02:55:51,219 --> 02:55:51,780
It's all right.

1738
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:55,540
When I play this, I'm not gonna play with the rings.

1739
02:55:55,940 --> 02:55:57,299
But we're just checking it out.

1740
02:55:58,659 --> 02:56:00,180
I didn't play the demo with the rings on.

1741
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:01,620
Wow, beautiful sky.

1742
02:56:05,370 --> 02:56:06,569
All right, that's cool though.

1743
02:56:06,569 --> 02:56:08,010
You know, that's kind of cool.

1744
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:13,860
There's a feature in the game where if you just want to kind of relax,

1745
02:56:15,139 --> 02:56:18,340
chill out, watch the story, and just kill stuff.

1746
02:56:19,219 --> 02:56:19,860
That's cool.

1747
02:56:19,860 --> 02:56:21,540
You just put the ring on if you want to do that.

1748
02:56:22,340 --> 02:56:26,899
There's no pressure to do or not to do it.

1749
02:56:27,459 --> 02:56:37,819
Actually, let me do.

1750
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:47,420
Okay.

1751
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:53,079
Is there a food mode?

1752
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:54,659
That?

1753
02:56:55,540 --> 02:56:57,059
I don't know if I would call that food mode.

1754
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:04,979
Somebody said,

1755
02:57:04,979 --> 02:57:08,260
I don't know if I'm going to spend all the money on the console and the game,

1756
02:57:09,059 --> 02:57:12,680
which is hundreds of dollars to just turn on food mode.

1757
02:57:17,770 --> 02:57:19,209
Yeah, I mean, if you.

1758
02:57:21,590 --> 02:57:25,780
But food mode is available.

1759
02:57:28,489 --> 02:57:44,340
I wonder how much longer this is.

1760
02:57:48,250 --> 02:57:49,719
I am supposed to be dead.

1761
02:57:52,170 --> 02:57:53,290
Wait, where's like the healer?

1762
02:57:54,250 --> 02:57:55,290
No, just group them all up.

1763
02:57:58,500 --> 02:58:30,100
Oh, don't hurt me.

1764
02:58:30,100 --> 02:58:31,379
There's a lot of people in this room.

1765
02:58:37,209 --> 02:58:49,559
Oh, I just blew his head up.

1766
02:58:52,090 --> 02:58:54,170
You still haven't killed the fucking healer.

1767
02:58:54,170 --> 02:58:55,129
Where's the healer?

1768
02:58:55,129 --> 02:58:55,850
All right, you.

1769
02:58:57,670 --> 02:58:58,629
Sorry about that.

1770
02:58:59,430 --> 02:59:07,819
That's a good way to juggle.

1771
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:21,049
What if I charge this?

1772
02:59:21,049 --> 02:59:38,969
Oh, no, you still sculpting off and on.

1773
02:59:40,420 --> 02:59:41,379
I've been kind of busy lately.

1774
02:59:41,379 --> 03:00:22,420
So let it break staggered.

1775
03:00:27,829 --> 03:00:28,229
Oh, my God.

1776
03:00:28,229 --> 03:00:28,950
These are not charged.

1777
03:00:30,149 --> 03:00:58,139
Let's go string it all together now.

1778
03:00:58,860 --> 03:01:20,969
Smash out.

1779
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:37,159
This is pretty beefy demo.

1780
03:01:41,770 --> 03:01:56,340
Now we're probably a long game.

1781
03:01:56,899 --> 03:02:00,860
I think most of the Final Fantasies are pretty long.

1782
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:02,729
There's a lot of content in them usually.

1783
03:02:03,450 --> 03:02:04,549
How long was the last one?

1784
03:02:04,549 --> 03:02:05,670
I'm like Final Fantasy 15.

1785
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:08,629
Like how if you just did the main campaign and just kind of went through it.

1786
03:02:09,350 --> 03:02:32,260
Give or take how many hours you say it would take to do like 70, 50.

1787
03:02:33,059 --> 03:02:34,420
Yeah, it's probably pretty similar.

1788
03:02:35,299 --> 03:02:39,700
They're like 40 or so.

1789
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:48,659
I don't know if it's 14 is like 80 hours.

1790
03:02:48,659 --> 03:02:58,520
Finally, I would see one of the boss fights in the game.

1791
03:02:59,319 --> 03:03:00,760
If you don't want to see the boss,

1792
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:03,799
if you don't want to see what this boss looks like when you fight this,

1793
03:03:03,799 --> 03:03:08,489
but imagine we're about to fight this boss would clock out.

1794
03:03:11,190 --> 03:03:14,709
I confess I expected more from the old man.

1795
03:03:14,709 --> 03:03:18,709
Final Fantasy 14 is like 400 hours.

1796
03:03:18,709 --> 03:03:19,989
And less from you.

1797
03:03:20,629 --> 03:03:23,430
This is the second time you've bested my sisters.

1798
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:27,829
Men of your talents are rare indeed.

1799
03:03:27,829 --> 03:03:28,870
400.

1800
03:03:28,870 --> 03:03:30,709
Oh, it's an MMO.

1801
03:03:30,709 --> 03:03:31,350
All right, yeah, yeah.

1802
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:36,149
If there's a hearth you long for, you will find more than enough warmth under my wings.

1803
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:39,500
You know exactly what I want.

1804
03:03:40,219 --> 03:03:44,020
Hand over the dominant and I'll leave you in peace.

1805
03:03:44,979 --> 03:03:47,379
You would dare to make demands of me?

1806
03:03:48,819 --> 03:03:51,659
Know your place, little lamb.

1807
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:56,920
Fool is a shepherd who eats every bleat of the flock.

1808
03:03:58,489 --> 03:04:01,610
And I will suffer yours no longer.

1809
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:04,329
All right, here we go.

1810
03:04:04,329 --> 03:04:06,489
Must I spell it out for you, branded?

1811
03:04:06,489 --> 03:04:07,450
Let's see.

1812
03:04:07,450 --> 03:04:08,250
I'm ready.

1813
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:09,049
I'm ready to see it.

1814
03:04:09,049 --> 03:04:10,250
No one is listening.

1815
03:04:10,250 --> 03:04:11,129
No one at all.

1816
03:04:13,049 --> 03:04:18,540
Little lamb, to the slaughter with you.

1817
03:04:22,469 --> 03:04:23,430
Okay, okay.

1818
03:04:25,030 --> 03:04:40,620
Come on, quit.

1819
03:05:06,809 --> 03:05:07,610
Oh, what does that mean?

1820
03:05:08,729 --> 03:05:09,530
Okay.

1821
03:05:19,479 --> 03:05:20,360
This is gonna kill her.

1822
03:05:20,360 --> 03:05:21,639
This is gonna literally kill her.

1823
03:05:26,549 --> 03:05:27,030
In the air.

1824
03:05:37,930 --> 03:05:38,809
Oh, shit, that hurt.

1825
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:47,909
Okay, scripted.

1826
03:06:09,020 --> 03:06:10,780
Uh-oh, now it's for the real fight.

1827
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:27,510
Wait.

1828
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:29,979
Oh, we're good.

1829
03:06:40,540 --> 03:06:40,940
Toggle.

1830
03:06:47,030 --> 03:06:47,270
Hey.

1831
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:52,889
Cry all you like.

1832
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:56,440
There's no one to save you now.

1833
03:06:57,079 --> 03:06:58,979
Okay.

1834
03:07:12,180 --> 03:07:15,610
I'll take a precise dodge any day.

1835
03:07:32,389 --> 03:07:32,870
Oh, shit.

1836
03:07:45,829 --> 03:07:49,850
Whoa.

1837
03:07:54,329 --> 03:07:54,649
Again.

1838
03:08:01,479 --> 03:08:02,280
Get down from there.

1839
03:08:03,239 --> 03:08:06,889
I gotta charge it up.

1840
03:08:08,889 --> 03:08:14,360
Toast the hurt.

1841
03:08:14,360 --> 03:08:16,360
You land, I'm gonna limit break, and you're dead.

1842
03:08:16,360 --> 03:08:17,159
Toast the hurt.

1843
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:23,879
Right on top of my okay.

1844
03:08:24,760 --> 03:08:35,819
Oh, there it is.

1845
03:08:36,459 --> 03:08:52,420
Almost 10k.

1846
03:09:12,309 --> 03:09:13,030
Bramble fall.

1847
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:24,120
If you failed that quick time event, then you just died.

1848
03:09:36,170 --> 03:09:37,690
I love the music changes.

1849
03:09:38,489 --> 03:09:49,959
I gotta get over 10,000 right there.

1850
03:10:03,139 --> 03:10:03,540
Shit.

1851
03:10:05,620 --> 03:10:11,819
Torval is definitely coming back.

1852
03:10:17,979 --> 03:10:26,569
Oh, fuck.

1853
03:10:26,569 --> 03:10:27,290
I'm all right.

1854
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:29,770
I just legs are broken.

1855
03:10:37,909 --> 03:10:38,389
Jesus.

1856
03:10:39,750 --> 03:10:45,270
Oh, my God.

1857
03:10:55,299 --> 03:11:07,940
It's gonna be like 15,000.

1858
03:11:08,659 --> 03:11:20,680
Whoa.

1859
03:11:21,719 --> 03:11:34,149
Dude, I'm fucking dodging every single thing.

1860
03:11:34,149 --> 03:11:35,350
I don't care if I get the rings on.

1861
03:11:35,350 --> 03:11:35,829
This is fun.

1862
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:54,360
You know, that hurt a lot.

1863
03:11:55,159 --> 03:12:17,510
This is it.

1864
03:12:18,469 --> 03:12:18,709
Right.

1865
03:12:19,430 --> 03:12:20,389
Crush her head.

1866
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:30,920
All right.

1867
03:12:32,889 --> 03:12:34,729
That's definitely I want to look at anything else.

1868
03:12:40,069 --> 03:12:41,110
Based easy mode.

1869
03:12:41,750 --> 03:12:42,469
Just for the demo.

1870
03:12:43,110 --> 03:12:43,590
It's all right.

1871
03:12:44,709 --> 03:12:49,209
We just want to see what was possible.

1872
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:56,040
The answer is simple, Benedicta.

1873
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:59,750
He was fighting for something he believed in.

1874
03:13:05,659 --> 03:13:06,940
We've played your games.

1875
03:13:08,489 --> 03:13:10,569
Now tell me where he is.

1876
03:13:11,209 --> 03:13:14,299
Who are you?

1877
03:13:17,209 --> 03:13:18,889
Curious to find out who he's talking about.

1878
03:13:21,129 --> 03:13:24,250
The full game comes out on June 22nd.

1879
03:13:26,889 --> 03:13:32,569
Uncover the mysteries of Final Fantasy 16, Clive, Sid, and Torval.

1880
03:13:34,149 --> 03:13:40,899
Their journey does not end here on the PlayStation 5 home entertainment console.

1881
03:13:56,579 --> 03:13:58,180
When it actually is doing that.

1882
03:14:11,540 --> 03:14:12,020
Cool.

1883
03:14:12,020 --> 03:14:12,340
All right.

1884
03:14:13,219 --> 03:14:13,780
I'm down.

1885
03:14:20,229 --> 03:14:21,590
All right, guys, that's going to be it.

1886
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:24,459
That was Final Fantasy 16's demo.

1887
03:14:24,459 --> 03:14:25,420
It is available right now.

1888
03:14:25,420 --> 03:14:27,899
You can go grab it if you want on the PlayStation 5 store.

1889
03:14:27,899 --> 03:14:32,700
Thank you Square Enix for sponsoring the segment of the stream.

1890
03:14:32,700 --> 03:14:34,020
Had a lot of fun.

1891
03:14:34,020 --> 03:14:38,729
Just a little taste before the launch.

1892
03:14:38,729 --> 03:14:45,670
It's a good place to start too, I would imagine.

1893
03:14:45,670 --> 03:14:50,489
Because honestly, I'm kind of starting with Final Fantasy 16.

1894
03:14:50,489 --> 03:14:55,350
It's been a very long time since I've cared about the franchise at all.

1895
03:14:55,350 --> 03:14:56,780
Very long time.

1896
03:14:56,780 --> 03:15:02,280
The last time I really played a Final Fantasy game, honestly, it has to be back in the Super Nintendo.

1897
03:15:03,239 --> 03:15:05,000
And then a little bit maybe.

1898
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:09,370
I want to say like a little of seven.

1899
03:15:09,370 --> 03:15:10,329
A little bit.

1900
03:15:10,329 --> 03:15:11,530
A little bit of ten.

1901
03:15:11,530 --> 03:15:15,420
But not really.

1902
03:15:15,420 --> 03:15:17,940
So it's a good place to start.

1903
03:15:17,940 --> 03:15:21,940
But yeah, that concludes the stream tonight.

1904
03:15:21,940 --> 03:15:27,030
Besides the sponsor, obviously the big news about me joining Offbrand.

1905
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,989
I'm really excited, guys.

1906
03:15:27,989 --> 03:15:29,030
I just, I truly am.

1907
03:15:29,909 --> 03:15:33,290
I know we fuck around a lot on this stream, but I hope I can put some,

1908
03:15:33,930 --> 03:15:40,139
I hope I can just put some effort, try to make some good stuff.

1909
03:15:40,139 --> 03:15:42,729
Joining what?

1910
03:15:43,129 --> 03:15:52,459
Okay, for those of you just joining, I have been appointed as chief creative officer of Offbrand.

1911
03:15:52,459 --> 03:15:56,149
Which is Ludwig's company, his media company.

1912
03:15:56,149 --> 03:15:57,909
So I'll be working a lot with Ludwig.

1913
03:15:57,909 --> 03:15:59,430
And obviously the rest of those guys.

1914
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:02,600
I think we're going to do a lot of really cool stuff.

1915
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:05,110
I hope so.

1916
03:16:05,110 --> 03:16:07,770
I'm going to try.

1917
03:16:07,770 --> 03:16:09,930
But thanks for watching.

1918
03:16:09,930 --> 03:16:10,729
Thanks for sticking around.

1919
03:16:11,799 --> 03:16:15,719
There will be way more information on this as I get started, as I keep going.

1920
03:16:15,719 --> 03:16:19,579
I know a lot of people were like, holy shit, he's retiring.

1921
03:16:19,579 --> 03:16:22,010
The answer is no, I'm not.

1922
03:16:22,010 --> 03:16:22,729
I'm still streaming.

1923
03:16:22,729 --> 03:16:23,530
I'm still going to be here.

1924
03:16:23,530 --> 03:16:25,079
I'm still hanging out.

1925
03:16:25,079 --> 03:16:28,979
But I will have other duties that I have to do in between streaming.

1926
03:16:28,979 --> 03:16:32,979
So there will be times when I tell you, hey, I got a lot going on with Offbrand.

1927
03:16:32,979 --> 03:16:34,180
I'll see you in like a week or two.

1928
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:35,459
Do you know what I mean?

1929
03:16:35,459 --> 03:16:39,479
Like it's not, I'm not going anywhere.

1930
03:16:39,479 --> 03:16:41,159
And I do that shit anyways.

1931
03:16:41,159 --> 03:16:42,920
Like I do it all the time anyways.

1932
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:55,340
Kind of the whole thing's coming together as the big picture of the future of my life, I guess.

1933
03:16:55,340 --> 03:16:59,579
But thanks everybody.

1934
03:16:59,579 --> 03:17:08,620
It's impossible to be in a position like this without having all of you kind of hold up the earth.

1935
03:17:08,620 --> 03:17:09,579
So I really appreciate it.

1936
03:17:09,579 --> 03:17:15,399
Anybody, if you've watched this channel for a minute, an hour, 10 years, came to the channel.

1937
03:17:15,399 --> 03:17:18,680
If you just came to the channel and you said this guy sucks, fuck this guy, you still here.

1938
03:17:18,680 --> 03:17:19,479
So thanks.

1939
03:17:19,479 --> 03:17:23,239
Thanks for hanging out, regardless of how you feel.

1940
03:17:23,239 --> 03:17:29,030
I did not ever think that I would be looking at announcements like this.

1941
03:17:29,030 --> 03:17:30,069
But I'm going to step up.

1942
03:17:30,069 --> 03:17:30,709
I'm going to try to.

1943
03:17:30,709 --> 03:17:31,350
We'll see what happens.

1944
03:17:32,069 --> 03:17:33,110
I'm going to put my effort into it.

1945
03:17:33,110 --> 03:17:35,079
So let's go.

1946
03:17:35,079 --> 03:17:36,760
The German employed arc.

1947
03:17:37,319 --> 03:17:37,959
That's right.

1948
03:17:37,959 --> 03:17:40,700
That's true.

1949
03:17:40,700 --> 03:17:49,620
Actually employed now.

1950
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:51,620
But yeah, thanks a lot, everybody.

1951
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:52,860
I'll see you guys soon.

1952
03:17:52,860 --> 03:18:01,739
Next stream will probably be I want to say maybe like Wednesday or Thursday.

1953
03:18:01,739 --> 03:18:03,260
Let's shoot for Wednesday.

1954
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:09,100
I do want to play the zoom beanies.

1955
03:18:09,100 --> 03:18:10,459
No, you're not Thursday.

1956
03:18:10,459 --> 03:18:11,500
Make it Thursday.

1957
03:18:11,500 --> 03:18:14,709
We'll do Thursday and like Saturday this week.

1958
03:18:14,709 --> 03:18:19,659
Same time.

1959
03:18:19,659 --> 03:18:24,409
Yeah, like four o'clock, four Pacific.

1960
03:18:24,409 --> 03:18:28,469
We are definitely going to get sick of the zoom beanies in probably an hour and a half.

1961
03:18:28,469 --> 03:18:29,909
So there'll be something else to do too.

1962
03:18:29,909 --> 03:18:34,969
The draft tweet.

1963
03:18:34,969 --> 03:18:36,010
I'll go over the draft tweet.

1964
03:18:36,569 --> 03:18:40,579
When we stream next, tell me to go over the draft tweet.

1965
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:42,420
And then sorceries will be right after that.

1966
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:48,200
Thank you again, Square Enix.

1967
03:18:48,200 --> 03:18:49,399
Thanks for watching.

1968
03:18:49,399 --> 03:18:51,180
I had a really great time.

1969
03:18:51,180 --> 03:18:58,870
Looking forward to playing it.

1970
03:18:58,870 --> 03:18:59,829
Have a great night.

1971
03:18:59,829 --> 03:19:07,930
He's choking up.

1972
03:19:07,930 --> 03:19:08,969
No, I'm just burping.

1973
03:19:08,969 --> 03:19:10,940
It's a small difference.

1974
03:19:22,379 --> 03:19:27,799
When are you going to do the tuba stream?

1975
03:19:27,799 --> 03:19:33,559
I probably said I probably said that at some point.

1976
03:19:33,559 --> 03:19:42,790
So burping is choking up.

1977
03:19:42,790 --> 03:19:43,270
Yeah.

1978
03:19:43,270 --> 03:19:53,030
What about infomercial streams?

1979
03:19:53,030 --> 03:19:58,219
Well, the follow up to the off brand stuff obviously is I made this comment a few times

1980
03:19:58,219 --> 03:20:07,059
back in January, February, but we're going to be just doing whatever.

1981
03:20:07,059 --> 03:20:11,659
I'm not going to have essentially I kind of want to take some of the pressure away.

1982
03:20:14,149 --> 03:20:18,149
I got to figure out something to stream every day or every other day, whatever.

1983
03:20:19,780 --> 03:20:25,450
And I think it's probably more fun to just like load up infomercials

1984
03:20:25,450 --> 03:20:28,729
and just watch for a couple hours and hang out.

1985
03:20:28,729 --> 03:20:33,129
Play something like Final Fantasy 16 and not be like, okay, well, I'm not going to do that again.

1986
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:39,690
You're going to see you will see a lot more of that like you already have.

1987
03:20:39,690 --> 03:20:41,290
Yeah, I'm not stressing it.

1988
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:55,459
Can we do a Street Fighter 6 training arc stream?

1989
03:20:55,459 --> 03:20:57,020
Maybe.

1990
03:20:57,020 --> 03:20:58,920
Just do what you want.

1991
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:02,260
Yeah, don't worry.

1992
03:21:04,139 --> 03:21:04,940
I'm still in.

1993
03:21:04,940 --> 03:21:05,500
I'm still in.

1994
03:21:08,549 --> 03:21:11,479
Don't take the off brand announcement that I'm out.

1995
03:21:11,479 --> 03:21:22,059
I'm still in.

1996
03:21:22,059 --> 03:21:22,940
You do you.

1997
03:21:25,670 --> 03:21:27,670
He hates streaming.

1998
03:21:27,670 --> 03:21:39,899
But yeah, will there be less streams over the course of the next however long period?

1999
03:21:39,899 --> 03:21:42,549
Yeah, I got to be honest with you.

2000
03:21:42,549 --> 03:21:44,329
Probably.

2001
03:21:44,329 --> 03:21:47,450
I imagine there probably would be periods where there's a lot going on

2002
03:21:47,450 --> 03:21:49,930
and there's a lot of stuff that I'm trying to do that I'm working on.

2003
03:21:49,930 --> 03:21:54,819
But I'll come back.

2004
03:21:54,819 --> 03:21:56,180
He's not denying it.

2005
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:59,530
Well, it's not going to be zero streams.

2006
03:21:59,530 --> 03:22:04,469
I'm just saying that when a project is being worked on,

2007
03:22:04,469 --> 03:22:09,670
I'll probably just be back in a couple weeks just like it always is.

2008
03:22:09,670 --> 03:22:14,010
It's a big change.

2009
03:22:14,010 --> 03:22:14,649
You'll get used to it.

2010
03:22:14,649 --> 03:22:16,170
Yeah, I mean, it is a big change.

2011
03:22:16,170 --> 03:22:21,399
This is probably the biggest change in my personal life and work life.

2012
03:22:21,399 --> 03:22:24,500
For it's been 12 years.

2013
03:22:24,500 --> 03:22:25,459
Started doing YouTube.

2014
03:22:25,459 --> 03:22:28,549
I just kind of got a following on YouTube and I was like,

2015
03:22:28,549 --> 03:22:31,139
oh, wait, I can make money doing this.

2016
03:22:31,139 --> 03:22:32,100
That's weird.

2017
03:22:32,100 --> 03:22:34,940
That seems like fucking impossible.

2018
03:22:34,940 --> 03:22:39,399
And then I just kind of honestly the Twitch moving to Twitch

2019
03:22:39,399 --> 03:22:40,840
was probably the other one.

2020
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:45,139
It's going to be a lot to get used to.

2021
03:22:45,139 --> 03:22:51,190
I know it will be, but we'll just take it as it comes.

2022
03:22:51,190 --> 03:22:52,469
I'm not going anywhere.

2023
03:22:52,469 --> 03:22:55,770
See you guys later.

2024
03:22:55,770 --> 03:22:56,729
See you on Thursday.

2025
03:22:56,729 --> 03:22:57,450
Have a great night.

2026
03:22:57,450 --> 03:22:58,090
Thanks for watching.

2027
03:22:58,090 --> 03:22:59,770
Thanks for sticking around during the sponsor segment.

2028
03:23:03,159 --> 03:23:04,120
See you on Thursday.

2029
03:23:04,760 --> 03:23:11,770
The future is bright.

2030
03:23:12,889 --> 03:23:14,329
I'll see you really soon.

2031
03:23:14,329 --> 03:23:38,860
Call your mother.
