1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:11,900
Oh, all right. Hello. Fuck this dog hair all over my boomer vitamin. No, I just like touched him.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,920
I just like petted him. I was like, okay, Otto, it's time to start the stream. Now I've got

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,219
fucking dog hair all over my boomer vitamins. Yeah, sorry I'm late today. I had some major p-

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,100
Okay, hold on a second. Let's take, hold on. Okay. I had some major PC fan issues that I

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,869
have since resolved. Let's hope my computer doesn't explode. That my case fans stop spinning.

6
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,009
All of them. The front ones. So I had to figure out why that was. So, you know, I'll take it apart,

7
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:53,210
plugged it back in, changed it, fucked with the power supply. Here's the TLDR for all of you.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,340
There are one, two, three, four case fans in here. One of them is permanently just doesn't

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,340
work anymore. So I really hope that my 3090 is not going to burn out because one of the case fans

10
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:17,930
doesn't turn on. But we're good. I might turn the graphics down a little bit. You're lying.

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,939
I swear to God. I don't know. I have this, this is a 30, I'm on a 3090 right now. You can make fun

12
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,140
of me all you want. I got, this is a 3090. You'll see it. This, this is the first real stream that

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,799
you're going to see with the 3090. What game have I played in the last like three or four weeks that

14
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:51,859
required anything more than like a fucking 780? That hasn't happened. The invisible hand, that

15
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:59,430
did not require a 3090. That wasn't getting the full capabilities of the 3090. Anyways, today,

16
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,510
yes, we're going to play Resident Evil Village. I have no idea how long the stream is going to be.

17
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,669
I plan on going two days. I might just get obsessed with it and play a shitload of it tonight. I might

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,669
be like after four or five hours. You know what? Fuck this. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll see.

19
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,090
Even if I give myself an extra hour, it doesn't matter. I'm sitting there like taking my computer

20
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:27,610
apart going like, I got to be live in like fucking 45 minutes. Every second counts. I get pissed off

21
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,659
when I have to pee. You get pushed against the clock and like a 60 second piss infuriates you.

22
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,860
I'm just sitting there going like, hurry the fuck up.

23
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,199
Why? I drank too much water today. That's 60 seconds that I couldn't have been inside the

24
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:57,189
computer. You're a goof. No, I'm telling you. All right. Yes, we're doing face cam today.

25
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:50,759
I need, let me tweet this. I'll be right back. Give me a second. Wait, it's, it's not, it's not

26
00:03:50,759 --> 00:04:03,580
village. It's V-I-L-L-A-G-E. I thought it was V-I-L-L-I-A-G-E. Like village. Like a village.

27
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,860
A village. It's village. I thought it was village. Like a welcome to the village.

28
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,449
I, I, I, well, you must think I've been really stupid over the years. I've never,

29
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,970
I've never done A. It's IA. Village. I don't know why I'm still holding these.

30
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,579
Okay. I'm holding these for some reason. I want to take these on stream and I think it's like funny

31
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:34,569
for some reason. Like, I don't know. Explain to me why I think this is funny. Oh, hold on.

32
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:41,379
Taking my turmeric. Wait, why is that funny? Well, taking, taking my, taking my like B vitamins.

33
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,740
Like why do I think they're taking like drugs? They're not even drugs. They're fucking natural

34
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:55,100
supplements. They're not essential oils. It's fucking supplements. It's turmeric. I'm taking it.

35
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:04,709
My pain shit. You know, I got to try something. What is this? Oh, yeah. Right. I forgot. Uh, uh,

36
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:15,699
yeah. This is a Fiji water. Hold on. There's not actually Fiji water in here. See, when I finish a

37
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,100
Fiji bottle, I just refill it with regular water. I still walk around and drink it. So people think

38
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm fucking very high class. Fucking pro tip. There's actually just regular water in here.

39
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:42,439
That's illegal. Illegal. He's pissed. No, I just, I'm just having, I have very, very

40
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,480
negative energy right now. I'm trying to like expel it before we start playing the game.

41
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:59,689
Oh, by the way, if you thought those were supplements, you fucking have no idea.

42
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:08,649
It's seeing 40 minutes where I can't even fucking read writing. It's turmeric and B vitamins. Give

43
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:14,250
it a, give it a rest. All right. So this is going to be interesting. Hopefully these fans work.

44
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,250
You see how big my arms look today? All right. This is resonable village. Hold on.

45
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,790
Right. When the edibles kick in, he's getting zonked. No, those are not. Why would it be? I

46
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:38,220
told you it's turmeric. Hope you guys had a good week. I found the piss bottle. That's not pee

47
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,000
either. Why is my, what are you doing webcam? Don't do that. I was a good place for the webcam

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,899
right here. They don't get scared. Oh, and you're like, you don't think I have more than one beverage

49
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,310
at this table. I'm prepared. I always am. That's the thing about being a streamer. Somebody said,

50
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,589
oh, what's it like being a streamer? You have any advice? Yes. Have like literally every liquid

51
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,269
you want to consume and all the food you want to eat for the whole day on the desk when you start

52
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:15,300
the stream. That's all. That's the only advice I'm going to give you. Okay. Looks good. We're

53
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,970
going to start resonable village on the brand new 30 90 not doing it on hardcore. No thanks.

54
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:36,339
This can too big. You guys hear it. Village of shadows. Long ago, a young girl went with her

55
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:42,519
mother to pick berries for her father who was hard at work, but the forest greeted them with a dark,

56
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:49,480
cold silence. The bushes empty, yet determined to find the berries. The rascal broke free from

57
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,199
his grasp and vanished into the trees. Mothers worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on

58
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,360
over vine and under branch and into the forest deep feeling strange eyes upon her. The girl

59
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,199
recalled mother's scary bedtime tales and her throat became bone dry.

60
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Then the bat Lord appeared. He greeted her warmly and bit his own wing. Come child quench you a

61
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,720
thirst he said. So she drank the thick dark blood and smiled with joy passing through the

62
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,439
graveyard menacing storm clouds loomed and the air turned cold shivering in her thin clothes.

63
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,519
Then a dark weaver appeared and with a click of his fingers,

64
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:42,279
three spells from Harry Potter. Beautiful dress. Come child warm yourself he coaxed. So she clothed

65
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:51,379
herself and smiled with joy across waters. The wrong game she went. No, it's not hoping a boat.

66
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,659
She found this wrong game. I'm losing my mind. Hungers grip tightened and her heart grew heavy.

67
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:07,299
Then the fish king appeared and offered one of his many fins. Come child. So the girl ate

68
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:15,539
and smiled with joy once more. Continuing on she soon entered the forest dark heart.

69
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,139
Then an iron steed appeared bearing a beautiful golden gear.

70
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:25,940
I just wanted to cut to something. He's like nose getting closed in a book and snatched

71
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,379
what she thought was another gift. And that's the end of the story. Like right here. The horse grew

72
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:39,740
angry and summoned the other monsters. Terror filled the girl's heart as the wild wind rose

73
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:51,450
around the beast. Suddenly a witch appeared. Dark yet regal. Oh come on. Oh I just the skin

74
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,809
came off my mouth. What was that? What's going on? Don't do it to the baby.

75
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,690
Babies can't even fucking understand English right now. She's asleep. You literally could

76
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,330
have just said banana, carrot, strawberry over and over again. She's only six months old.

77
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,960
Woman at the store said it was traditional. A local tale. Besides,

78
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,679
Rose doesn't seem to mind. I'm getting a little screen tearing. What's going on 3090?

79
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,539
Thank god we moved here so that you wouldn't have to deal with any of that. Remember?

80
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,220
You're getting screen tearing. I am. There's nothing wrong with my memory.

81
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:42,570
You're just being paranoid. It's not. I'm sorry. But I'm not paranoid. I'm just cautious.

82
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:50,860
Then go cautiously take your daughter to bed. I heard there's a lot of weird PC problems this

83
00:10:50,860 --> 00:11:00,600
game. I don't. I don't. I hate this. I don't like this. If somebody wants me to hold their

84
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,639
baby I just I hate to decline but I do because I don't I feel like I'm gonna like break it.

85
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,559
I can't blame her. You know what I mean? It's like oh why don't you hold the baby?

86
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,200
Like did you say something? Nothing. No I don't think so. How do we hold it?

87
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,879
And they teach you oh what you do is you support the head and you put the neck up and you have to

88
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,240
make sure that it goes that way you know but rest the bum. It's like I don't I can I just

89
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,360
watch you do it? I don't want to fucking do it. All right yeah the graphics are fucking what's

90
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,179
going on here? I know look I know I'm not utilizing the extent of the 3090. I'm scared because one of

91
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,539
my fans doesn't work. So look look I got 23 gigabytes of available memory but I'm afraid

92
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:50,470
of the fucking overheating. So I turned it down a little. But I need to fix this. Why is it is it

93
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,769
v-sync? Can I make my frame rate the same with the refresh rate? Is that the problem? Or should

94
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:04,250
I just turn on v-sync? Why is it doing that? Yes yes but what if it makes the graphics card

95
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,929
go faster? Oh that didn't fix it. I'm still getting a bunch of screen tearing. How am I

96
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:20,820
getting screen tearing? I have to turn on v-sync. Doesn't v-sync like give you input lag though? I

97
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:32,789
feel like I'm gonna complain about that. Should I just do it? Well let's see. Yeah I got input lag

98
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:49,750
now. I'll see how I fare for a little while. Sink off. Fuck it up. Okay I'll be fine. Whatever.

99
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,309
All right let's go. All right so what do I have to do? Feed the baby? Oh this looks fucking beautiful

100
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,789
on a 3090 if I will say. Oh wait you guys can't even see that because I have to I forgot to do

101
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:06,100
that. So like on the next stream I'm gonna up the quality of the stream to like 900p. All right we've

102
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:19,509
got tomato uh bread. Do it now? I can't do it now. It's not gonna work. Does we just eat bread and

103
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:28,570
sauce? Wait what is that? Don't get too close to me when I'm cooking babe. Did you take this? Oh right

104
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:36,039
you've you've you've. Watch out for that splattering hot oil. Is it european diet? Bread,

105
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:47,559
sauce, and apples is european? What are you talking about? What's this? Oh baby food. Mia makes

106
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,519
everything by hand so this stuff keeps piling up. I have to change that one. I hate F as I can examine.

107
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm gonna make it uh one of the mouse buttons maybe. Uh wait we'll see. Give me like 20 minutes

108
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:13,080
we'll see if I hit it. What's the sprint button? How's the audio for you guys? Is it good? All right

109
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,519
put the baby to bed. Wait is this um those of you that haven't seen Resident Evil 7 or haven't

110
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,399
played Resident Evil 7? I don't have no fucking idea why you're watching this without if you want

111
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,190
like this is I'm gonna talk about the 7th game. Is this the house? Is this the the original family's

112
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,549
house? They're there. It's like I said to your mom. That book's too scary for you. This is like the original

113
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:47,850
house. That's cool. No it's not. Sure? Turn. Your mom and I love this song so much. Hey two hands,

114
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:59,379
two hands man. It's like a bicycle. Oh my god that's the top of the cake from our wedding day.

115
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:11,820
I think I gotta turn the brightness down. Oh wait I have to kill these. Why do I even keep this

116
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,620
around? I should get rid of it someday. These interact with the monkey toy into the spoiler.

117
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:28,570
Gotta do a deep clean before Rose starts walking. Wait is this the baby's sleep? No. I'm not like

118
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,929
wait why are we this is like kind of bad. Why am I bringing the baby into like the weird dusty room?

119
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,850
Somebody else will read this. Somebody else will read this. I hate reading these. I know people

120
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,610
are gonna get so pissed about this but I fucking hate reading these. I just wish somebody would

121
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,529
just say it like uh Bioshock. And I mean like just let me just let me pick up a fucking tape

122
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:55,580
and just play it in my ear. Like even Diablo 3 got this right and that game was fucking dog shit.

123
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:05,820
Well for the first year or two. Everyone's forgotten about this already. You wouldn't

124
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,740
pay attention anyways. Well at least I mean I've fallen asleep listening to audiobooks and like

125
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,830
12 chapters go by and I wake up and I'm like a third of the way through the book. I'm just saying

126
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:30,200
well oh well. All right I have to play with the monkey toy. Wherever the monkey toy is. Almost

127
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:38,820
there honey. I'm gonna get screamed at right? I mean this is I can't do two headphones. No I

128
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:46,649
have to hear myself talk. That's a cool toy. All right wait wait play with the monkey toy.

129
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:56,970
Rose is closed for tomorrow. Can you guys hear me? I think we need to move mic. I don't see a monkey

130
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:26,869
toy. Play with the monkey toy? I don't see a monkey toy. Ah I see a monkey toy now. I thought a car

131
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:35,880
was gonna hit us. I thought a car was gonna crash into us. I was supposed to scream. I was like what

132
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:49,220
the fuck? That is here. Yeah yeah Rosemary Winters. Screenings, hearing, vision, and touch reflex

133
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:56,490
are all good. Patience good. You're on the second floor. I don't know we could have gone off a jump.

134
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:02,039
Mia and I had another fight. I accidentally mentioned what happened three years ago and

135
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,480
she blew up at me. We finally settle down in our new life in Europe and can bring Rose up properly.

136
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,160
But I still feel like a part of me is trapped in that hellhole back in Louisiana. So this is

137
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,369
talking about the seventh game. I know Mia doesn't like to talk about it but can we really just forget

138
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:22,549
everything and pretend it didn't happen? Should we face what happened there so we can live our lives

139
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:27,670
with Rose without it hanging over our heads? We owe her that much at least. I know Mia knows this.

140
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:34,900
She wouldn't have exploded like that at the hospital if she didn't care. All right let's

141
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,900
put this kid to bed. Can you keep your mother waiting? She's scary when she's angry. Oh yeah

142
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,619
didn't she like she like chainsawed my hand off. All right Rose time for bed. There you go sweetheart.

143
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:54,140
Don't you worry. I'll be right downstairs. Daddy won't let those weird fairy tale monsters get you.

144
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,099
We're gonna get Ghostbusters 2'd here. Anybody that saw Ghostbusters 2.

145
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,940
Like are we is that gonna happen? I feel like that's gonna happen. I feel like that was like

146
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:13,460
the guy like oh VEGAL. Like isn't he gonna come and like steal a baby? If you haven't seen Ghostbusters

147
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:28,809
2 then what's wrong with you? People in chat aren't old enough for that. I would rather you

148
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:39,779
watch Ghostbusters 2 three times in a row than watch this stream right now. Watch out this.

149
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm not gonna say that because that's an actual spoiler. I just went like I just made like a voice.

150
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:57,319
All right it's time for dinner. Is she okay? Sleeping like uh is that Mia? Like a baby. That

151
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:03,700
smells good. What's that? Oh hands off mister. It's churba de lagoon. It's a local recipe. Wish you

152
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,859
went like wow you've gone full native haven't you? Like my health bar went down a little.

153
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,400
But if you're gonna keep sulking all evening maybe you shouldn't have any.

154
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,619
What we got here? You really have to stop worrying.

155
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:24,019
I almost missed. Finding you in Louisiana. The pregnancy. Chris moving us here.

156
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,380
Military training. It all happened so fast you know. Well at least we're all together.

157
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:37,420
No the baby's gonna get VEGO'd. Everything's gonna be- Seriously think we can just forget

158
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,480
about what happened in Louisiana? It happened so long ago. I just I don't understand why you are so-

159
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,319
I've told you. Wait what happened? Did you snipe him?

160
00:20:52,519 --> 00:21:06,839
What the fuck? Wait what? Why is it- Who's doing this? Why would you do this?

161
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:18,599
That was at every angle. It's-

162
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,809
What the hell? Sorry Ethan. No! No you're supposed to be Wesker! Why?

163
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:54,009
Go on move. All clear. What the hell you doing with my daughter? Package secured sir. Package

164
00:21:54,009 --> 00:22:05,849
secured? Take him away. I said get your hands off her! Ethan no. Kills people by the way. I

165
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:14,859
never understood why people continue to do that in tv shows. I would be instantly dead if you did

166
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:28,700
that to my right into the middle of my head. What is photo mode? Did I have like paused it

167
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:50,170
at some point? Well whatever. Who's calling? Hey doc. No problem we'll be there. How's the doc?

168
00:22:51,049 --> 00:23:01,400
She'll see us next week. Hey now think positively all right? We talked about this. I know.

169
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:10,500
We hardly talk about anything else. I keep telling you it's not Rose that I'm worried about. Well

170
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,420
then what are you worried about? Look she's gonna be fine. I just know it. What else matters?

171
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:24,339
We matter Ethan. You matter. You just- Nia what are you talking about?

172
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:33,619
Is there something you're not telling me? Come on talk to me. Damn it. Work. I have to take this.

173
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:46,869
Shit work is calling. Look at how the fucking 3090 really makes that look real.

174
00:23:47,829 --> 00:24:06,500
But what happened now? Did we get in a car accident? Why did this happen?

175
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:20,970
Oh it's work. Shit I gotta take this. What are you talking about? Where's Chris Redfield and Rose?

176
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,299
Somebody just like fucking strangled that guy from behind like squished his windpipe.

177
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:42,950
Oh no that was where the edibles kicked in. What are you doing here? This is a secure oh boy.

178
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:53,049
Eliminate target. Recover body. Secure Rosemary Winters and Ethan Winters. Move the two

179
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:59,720
Winterses. Move the two Winterses to site C for further investigation. At least two

180
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,980
transport officers doing good. Why do they have to kill the girl? Any guns back here?

181
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:31,349
I don't think so. All right let's go. Is this 90 FOV? All right. All right fine. I'll put them both in.

182
00:25:32,069 --> 00:26:00,779
Do I have like light up shoes? Work is calling. Turn the light off. This is why I didn't want

183
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,420
to start till later in the afternoon because it's fucking it's three o'clock in the afternoon in Las

184
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,299
Vegas. I this is just sunny out right now. I'm telling you this is why I wanted to start later.

185
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:17,380
But that's not why I actually started later. I actually started later because my fans didn't

186
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:25,769
work. What was the windows? The windows are closed. I don't have like blackout curtains in my house.

187
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:44,599
Oh that's you're gonna have to get a you're gonna have to get a shot for that one. Where the hell am

188
00:26:44,599 --> 00:27:05,859
I going? Oh shit. Birds. A lot of dead birds everywhere. They're being hung up everywhere.

189
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:15,420
Turn the light off. I can't turn the fucking light off. All right somebody tell me is this 90 FOV

190
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:30,200
before I like immerse myself in this game or do I have to do something? Is it? Okay do your best.

191
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:39,450
No there's not a good fix for it. What? You need a mod. What the fuck are you talking about? What?

192
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:54,789
It's 80. It's locked at 80. You have to hack the game. What the fuck are you talking about?

193
00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:07,960
That's not that can't be real. How is that? How can there not be 90 FOV in a 1920 by 1080 game?

194
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,240
Like the ability to have it without it being a that doesn't make any sense.

195
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:29,559
Mod manager and FOV trainer. Don't restart that. I thought that was said resume.

196
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:40,890
I would have. Fuck Capcom. Fuck you Capcom. Capcom sucks. That would I just ruined my game

197
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,049
experience. That would have like scared me and I would have been like holy shit that was so scary.

198
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:53,339
Are you fucking kidding me? You've already ruined my game experience because it's like wow the FOV

199
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,099
looks weird. We have to hack my video game to do something that should have uh that's been a normal

200
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:07,960
thing since like 2012. How does it even happen? How does this even happen? Is how does this happen?

201
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:33,420
Is everybody asleep? Meltdown percent. That would have been like a good scare too.

202
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,099
I'm fucking just almost came out of my nose. The first thing if you're gonna have a game go on PC

203
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,259
I'm sorry. I have no fucking I have absolutely no sympathy for any of this shit. If a game is

204
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:04,730
gonna release on PC and it's after 2008 if you if it's not 90 FOV just throw the whole thing the

205
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:10,170
garbage and start over. Like it should not even release. I can't even fucking believe it. Like

206
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:16,869
it's so simple. If they just release this for console and just copy and paste the fucking code

207
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:21,670
over here. Nobody cares about fucking PC gaming. Everyone thought this was gonna people people

208
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,029
thought like five years ago man PC gaming people gonna start to care way more about this. Well

209
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:31,750
companies are starting to take PC gaming way more seriously. No if they won't give a fuck about this.

210
00:30:47,799 --> 00:31:05,509
Baby rage. It's true though what the fuck. It's available in photo mode. I can't believe you have

211
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:08,710
to hack your fucking game to do something that should be here from like 10 years ago.

212
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:46,859
You're whining now. Yeah I am. It's really fucking annoying. Oh is this the big lady?

213
00:31:46,859 --> 00:32:00,170
It's already 90 FOV. It'd be so funny if it actually was. I hope it is so that I seem like

214
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:24,009
a fucking psycho. I really don't think it is though. Is there anything else I can do in here?

215
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:50,619
Can I pick this up? Under the bed? Books? Oh fuck okay over here. I can't see anything though.

216
00:32:50,619 --> 00:33:09,130
Oh don't make me go into the basement. I thought that was a sausage. It's a banana.

217
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:53,509
Oh wait I wasn't done. It's pretty creepy. What's that? There's something in there. All right I'm

218
00:33:53,509 --> 00:34:04,700
ready. I'm ready. Here comes one two three. It's gonna jump out. It's gonna be behind me. I grab

219
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,500
the broom and just turn around. I thought right now I grab this broom and I turn around. I just

220
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,260
start swinging as hard as I can. If any like horror games and horror movies have taught me anything

221
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,619
it's that just grab this and just just turn and swing as hard as you fucking can in a circle.

222
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:42,650
Damn it there's nothing here. Okay I knew it. Is that the rat? Is the rat doing that?

223
00:34:53,610 --> 00:35:34,980
Hey! Hey! Hey! What's in all this? All right give me a weapon. I need a weapon. I need a chair. I

224
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:43,369
need a stick. I need a like a rake or something. Give me a rake. There's gotta be something right?

225
00:35:48,760 --> 00:36:06,179
Rake? Run? Or a gun? Yeah I mean I was I'll take a gun but I'll take something just a rake or

226
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:32,019
something just to start. Where the hell am I? Wow this looks really cool. All right I did I may

227
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:38,619
have said fuck Capcom earlier. I want to just correct that. Fuck Capcom for this particular

228
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:41,500
instance. I love Resident Evil 2. It's like one of my favorite games the last five years.

229
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:04,570
I need to like get my emotions under control. I really am like Donald Duck.

230
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:14,340
I connect so strongly with him. I don't know I just like I get so just so frustrated. Oh look at

231
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:35,210
that poor miserable duck. I can't stand! He starts eating plates and shit. Okay there's like a stable.

232
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,239
Is this is this the big lady? Is this the introduction to the big lady? Even like a

233
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:53,019
is a big lady a bad character? Is it like a quest giver? Let's need some okay I need something to

234
00:37:53,019 --> 00:38:08,329
to pull the well up. I got in here. Oh so there's some manure. I need a pulley to pull the well up.

235
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:37,719
Erin Erin. All right pull. I'm looking for like something to put maybe back here. Okay um

236
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,699
over here. Is that a horse? Is that a horse statue or is that a dead horse?

237
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,340
I kind of it's hard to tell. I think that's a statue of a horse.

238
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:09,050
I'll be sleeping in that bed. Maybe maybe they're out. An easy to pick lock. All right well let's

239
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:18,360
go. Let me do it. Is this tuber commentary? Oh what? Because I'm like wait somebody's still

240
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:51,130
making food here. I'll be sleeping in that bed. Oh it's that thing again. All right nothing in

241
00:39:51,130 --> 00:40:02,360
here. Tuber reactions. Tuber gameplay. Why can I pick it? Do I need a lock pick? I don't have

242
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:22,539
anything. Oh no. Oh shit. Tuber. You're talking like a tuber. Hey this is just my normal speaking

243
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:27,860
voice man. What are you talking about? Is it because I'm playing a game that came out like a

244
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:43,179
week ago? Is that why everybody's saying this? I mean it looks great. It really does. Capcom.

245
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,420
App. Just out doing yourselves. Art direction. Phenomenal. Graphics. Unbelievable.

246
00:40:48,059 --> 00:41:08,840
How did he just crashed it? Pick up that fucking rake. Pick something. Pick up a weapon man.

247
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:19,559
One of these rocks will do. Fuck Capcom. I didn't play the game for five minutes and I already just

248
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:40,070
said that. Don't worry I'll patch it in in three months. Locked due to missing homeowner. It's

249
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:59,420
locked. It's got one of those things on it okay. I believe this is where we need to go. Ah there's

250
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:14,840
a knife. Okay finally a weapon. Knife. Attack. Is it like a block? What am I hitting? Am I stabbing

251
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:33,619
myself in the stomach? They don't you don't get a knife and then not fight something. Nothing okay.

252
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:48,039
Here we go. Friendly. Friendly. How did he miss? Who are you? Who sent you? How did you miss? There

253
00:42:48,039 --> 00:43:01,019
was an accident down the road. He shot me in point blank and missed. He looks like Ernest. One second.

254
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:11,670
Who is? What the hell was that? Do you have a gun? What? Please tell me you have a gun.

255
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:31,219
No why would I? Well give me yours. You can't seem to aim with it. Take it. Take it. Dude you

256
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:35,059
stopped shooting the gun. Are you listening? Stop shooting your weapon. You have no idea

257
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:44,570
what you're doing. This guy sucks. This guy sucks. Oh my god that guy was awful. Can I get his gun?

258
00:43:48,070 --> 00:44:18,840
Shit. Dead body. He did his best. Wait there's more. Okay I kind of I want to toggle. I want to

259
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:29,929
toggle. I want to toggle for controls please. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go.

260
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:42,619
Uh I want toggle. Is there a why would there be a toggle for like aim downsides right? It has to be

261
00:44:42,619 --> 00:45:02,019
though right? Zoom in and out. Aim. No there's no. Why would there be a toggle? Of course there's

262
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:12,389
not. Why would there be a toggle? I like toggle. It's easier to do. Easier to use. Because then

263
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:18,860
you don't have to like depress down my middle finger. I know people think it's bad but whatever.

264
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:46,230
I like it. What the hell is wrong with this place? There's somebody there. Holy shit.

265
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:57,989
Shit. This guy keeps losing his hand. What the fuck was that? All right let's shoot him.

266
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:22,539
Shoot him. Space is guard? What? I could have just shot him to hit free time. These guys take a lot

267
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:29,929
of shots. Oh my god these are all headshots. Like every single one of those is a headshot. Every

268
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:41,619
single one. Holy shit that's a lot of time to shoot. What the hell? All right so don't use weapons

269
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:47,340
that often. Okay one is. Okay two. Do I have a flashlight? No why would I have a flashlight?

270
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:57,769
What am I talking about? Chem fluid. Okay view materials that can be crafted. Okay so first aid

271
00:46:57,769 --> 00:47:03,769
is chem fluid and herb. It looks like they got rid of anything besides green. Like just green herbs.

272
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:17,619
See items. Family photo. Treasure. Okay let's go. Everything gives you ammo. There it is. All right

273
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:24,099
so herb. I don't think this looks like this. Just all right. Craft first aid. Excuse me. Get

274
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:51,960
out of the way. First aid. Okay do it. I made a first aid kit. Okay that. Do I have it? One and

275
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:02,940
collect the item to craft. Did I already do it? Okay am I losing my mind here? I've already made

276
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:16,860
it. Well it wasn't really. It wasn't like a good indicator. I don't need to use it. Not pretending.

277
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:23,059
Well I just. I didn't see. I don't have key to open this. This needs some kind of key.

278
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:45,210
He sucks. I don't. Does this guy have anything on him? Wait can I shoot this lock? Is it even the lock?

279
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:59,300
No. There's gonna be another one of those guys. All right bolt cutters. Here we go. Yeah let's go.

280
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:07,739
Don't let them bully you. Nobody's bullying me. I just played. Nobody's bullying me. I just played

281
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:38,260
this game six days late. You already know where the bolt cutters are. I don't. Cool. I gotta. Okay

282
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:49,190
is ammo really a problem in this game like it is in every single one of these games?

283
00:49:49,190 --> 00:50:02,139
Yes. Oh god. Somebody gonna run down the stairs. Handgun ammo. Open inventory. Okay. Yes. I was

284
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:06,860
just discarded. Okay. It just. You have a huge inventory in this game. That's good.

285
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:42,760
What? Okay. Okay do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Please. Hey. He gets just a scare. He can't get in here.

286
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,849
Can I just get. I got chemicals. Hey. We can get in. He can get in. Did he get in? Can he get in here?

287
00:50:49,849 --> 00:51:05,780
Can he get in? Hey. Oh fuck. Hey. What do I do? What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?

288
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:17,880
Go out here? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Ah. Can I jump?

289
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:54,420
Or do I get him off? Fuck. I'm gonna die. What the hell? Why did I try to put three in there?

290
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:01,670
Is it over? He's taking three clips. Like oh shit. Which one?

291
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,619
Oh for the legs. Not for the head. God damn it. I didn't mean to do that. My

292
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:34,019
my mouse is really sensitive. Big lady. Survivors. It's the big lady. Go to the house near the field.

293
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:43,050
Okay. Those aren't any kind of standard zombie. Those things. Usually. Okay. Every Resident Evil

294
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:48,489
game has done this before. The first enemy you face is just a standard zombie. These guys are

295
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:59,449
very very quick. Okay. Go to the big field. Where should I go over? Oh my god. Okay.

296
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:11,340
I don't think this is the right way. I wish I had a flashlight so I could see anything.

297
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:20,579
First enemy in Resident Evil 7 is your wife. Yeah but it's really it's pretty scripted.

298
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:44,860
I can't break this. I don't even. Wait. Hold on. I gotta I gotta make another uh how many items do I

299
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:59,510
have? Got it. You missed the shotgun. Stop stop stop. This part sucks. What? What do you mean

300
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:13,559
missed? Go to the old house. What are you talking about? What? Use the map. I didn't even know I

301
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:28,900
had a map. Why would I have a map of this place? I just got like dumped here. You missed the

302
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,900
shotgun. Go back. Did I really miss the shotgun? Why would they give you? No. I don't I don't

303
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,349
actually don't believe you guys. Why would you get a shotgun this early? I can't even leave.

304
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:56,090
I'm stuck here. I can only go one way. Don't help him. I don't I really don't think there's

305
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:17,860
a shotgun. I think you're full of shit. Oh my god. I mean run. What? Oh my god. What did I do?

306
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,300
What did I do? What happened to me? Damn it. What did I do that for? I gotta run.

307
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:37,099
Ammo ammo ammo ammo. All right. Up up up up up. Survive the attack. Shotgun. Shotgun. Okay.

308
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:52,840
What is that? Gunpowder. What's in here? Shotgun. What's in there? Shotgun bullets.

309
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:03,780
Kick that down. Wait. What's that? What's that? Who is it? Gunpowder. Examine. It's full of flower.

310
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,980
Oh I can blow up. Why why do they think I can blow up the flower by shooting it?

311
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:25,369
Can I go down? There's no end to them. Why do you what? What's that? Rusted scrap. I don't want to

312
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:40,230
miss any items. I don't know. Wait. I need to look at the map. Straight up here. Scrap metals for hats.

313
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:46,179
Oh. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.

314
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:01,900
I want whatever fell on the ground. I want. I want what fell on the ground. I want what fell.

315
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:32,980
Close the door. That's. That is explosive flower. I want to shoot it. Oh my god. What the fuck is

316
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:39,780
happening? Where am I supposed to go? Survive? What? Where? They're shooting arrows at me. What

317
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:46,219
the fuck is this? Legolas bullshit. What is happening to this? Who's firing arrows?

318
00:57:49,110 --> 00:58:13,769
What the fuck is this? Oh my god. How am I getting up here? Oh my god. Get back down.

319
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:42,760
Oh my god. It's a huge guy. What's this? Oh my god. What's this? Money? How do I?

320
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:53,130
Am I safe in here? I think I'm safe in here. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

321
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:29,699
Jump from roof to roof? Get out of my way. Get. Fuck. Who am I? I guess we're going this way.

322
00:59:29,699 --> 01:00:35,190
Oh my god. Am I dead? White blockers from Game of Thrones. I want to zoom in. It's a perfect

323
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:41,780
picture. All right. Go in. How do I zoom in? Adjust the scope of the camera. Area of view. I

324
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:59,929
can't do anything with this. No depth of field. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Filters. Oh my god. I'm

325
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:13,110
going to get an Instagram filter. Okay. Lens distortion. No, none of that. Frames and logos.

326
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:27,769
Game. I don't know. Other. Grid. Off. Okay. Now what? Did I get it? Did I take the picture?

327
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:45,000
I guess I took it. At a heart. That's so stupid. Imagine this is what they were using as their

328
01:01:45,000 --> 01:02:13,739
like PR shit. Frame type. That's perfect. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I like this one. It's a book

329
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:32,010
cover. It kind of is a book cover, isn't it? It really is a book cover. I can't change any

330
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:45,659
of this stuff though. All right. So I got it, right? Nice lock screen. So how do I take the

331
01:02:45,659 --> 01:03:13,000
picture? I got it, right? I got it. I think I hit, I pressed F. Yeah, I got it. No, I, okay. No,

332
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:23,269
no, no. Now that I know that exists, I'm going to abuse it. All right. This is way too loud,

333
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:47,099
by the way. I have to turn it down. This is Mario Odyssey's camera, but worse. Is this a sleigh?

334
01:03:47,900 --> 01:04:03,460
Why? Oh, why? It was a sleigh. I'm trying to kill that motherfucker.

335
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,590
Monster. Oh, I can't open this. It has one of those things. All right. I got to remember these

336
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,110
because this is important. The keys. I'm going to have to open them later. Backtracking Barry.

337
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:26,949
I'm not coming over there yet. Let me make sure. Let me like loot the place.

338
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:36,579
You're going to be sitting there for a few minutes, lady, because there was a bunch of

339
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:42,469
shit that I didn't get. I can just go get it now. And without all the chaos that was ridiculous,

340
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:51,400
that was absolute chaos. Did I miss anything? All right. Let me check. You're a loot goblin.

341
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,440
Well, look, I mean, it's important. I want to make sure I have like items and shit.

342
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:58,199
That doesn't waste the clip, right? Because I know that happens in some games.

343
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:04,250
Anything else I'm missing? All right. Yeah. Flower. Like, what's this for?

344
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:14,780
All right. So what it was, I don't know why, what that was for. That doesn't do anything.

345
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:22,309
The map would literally tell you if you finished an area. Oh, sir. Okay. Search completed. I get it.

346
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:27,139
All right. Well, that's new. That didn't happen before. Yes, it did. That was in all the Resident

347
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:50,039
Evil games. All right, we go back to the Jingle Bell lady. That's the big lady. Um, no, it's not.

348
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:06,440
Big lady goes like this. Hello. You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. Hey, can you hear me?

349
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:23,289
It's you, the child's father. Hey, wait, do you mean Rose? She is in great danger.

350
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:28,579
No, since mother Miranda brought her to the village, we have fought this.

351
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:33,349
I'm trying to get like, uh, the monsters. I want to get her going like this

352
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,510
and then put make like a YouTuber thumbnail. Harold's danger.

353
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:58,260
I mean, I could have clearly just pointed the gun at this lady and been like,

354
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,820
tell me what's going, tell me what you know. Like I'm like, I have a gun and like,

355
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,019
you're like this weird witch person. Like I will shoot you. Just tell me what,

356
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:33,380
tell me what's going on. I have weapons. Like, where the fuck am I? You're a psycho.

357
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,099
I'm assigned to psycho. I just got literally attacked by all these people that were just

358
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:42,500
trying to kill me and bite my hand off and shit. This is not a regular place.

359
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,179
This is like, shit's going down here. People are killing you and eating you.

360
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:54,420
What the fuck? I thought I just grabbed it. It's Q. May they come to eat our flesh. May

361
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,059
they come to tear us apart. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to read that. And then what?

362
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:05,019
I'm not supposed to like carry my gun. A guy with a sledgehammer just jumped from a ceiling,

363
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:20,489
like 40 foot story and was swinging it at me and easy to pick locks. Shit. I want to get in there.

364
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:31,590
I don't know what made me just think about this. I'm just going to say it because I don't know why

365
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:35,670
I'm thinking it, but I've just, I was thinking it for some reason right now. Chewing gum is really

366
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:39,189
gross. Chewing gum. I hate the most. I don't know why that was. I don't know what that's from.

367
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:51,460
It's from Billy Wonka. It's still somehow it's cause I don't know why I had to say that,

368
01:08:51,460 --> 01:09:05,859
but I just did. Why V? It's M. Look for Rose. Okay. Sure. We will. I move around. All right.

369
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:11,140
This is where I am. So this door is locked. I didn't search this whole place, but let's just

370
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:24,010
keep going. The vitamin B just kicked in. Oh, wait. No. Damn it. Okay. Well, there's two of those.

371
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:39,770
You never know what could be under the car. You're high on turmeric. Let's check and open

372
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:45,979
this door. Can I even go in here? No. You have a front door. What about this thing?

373
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:55,699
Ever? Okay. I just want to make sure I don't miss anything. I'm trying to complete the game.

374
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:05,340
Castle Dimetri Sioux. Well, that's where the big lady is. I know that's what the character's name

375
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:15,670
is. Talk from the other side. All right. All right. Let's just go. Let's just go get the

376
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:22,699
introduction. We're going to get like a, like an interesting, like violin, like piano mix.

377
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,260
She's going to waltz in like, Oh, hello. It's going to be like,

378
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:33,189
it's going to be like a violin and shit. It's going to be cool. I can't wait.

379
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:47,880
Oh, darling. I bet she says darling at least two or three times. I guess this leads to the castle.

380
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:56,300
All right. I need to find that thing and that thing. There's two circle depressions there.

381
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:20,630
Let's check out in here. What is that? Ooh, there's one of them. Ooh, what the hell? Oh,

382
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:33,319
type right up. Good thing my game didn't like crash. Something's still in here. What is still

383
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:39,739
in here? Ooh, disaster fall upon the village. Seek out the crests. One is in the care of the

384
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:54,500
church. The other is at Louisa's house. Okay. Louisa's house. Got it. So Louisa's house is

385
01:11:56,649 --> 01:12:01,619
down here at Louisa's house. Which one of these is Louisa's house? Probably this one or probably

386
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:10,619
that one. This one or here. So we need to go that way. Go back. It's not fully explored.

387
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:39,850
Shit. What did I miss? How's this not fully explored? Look up. Crystal fragment. Treasure.

388
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:48,180
Whoa. I got a treasure. White mineral found in this region could probably sell it. Valuable.

389
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:53,619
Oh, shit. That's cool. Now. Ah, all right. Good. Good. I'm making money.

390
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:00,630
Fuck you, chat. What? Look at the map. Yeah, I know. Find a way to open the castle gate. Yeah.

391
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:08,039
So I have to go to this place. This place has keys and shit. All right. Let me go over there.

392
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:19,539
Making money. What? Explore everything. I don't want to miss anything, guys.

393
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:30,020
Another one of these wells that I can't use. Stop helping him. I want him to lose. See how

394
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,340
many headshots I got in a row. And by the way, that first part I've heard was very difficult.

395
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:52,699
I did it. I only had to use one healing potion. Okay. How many bullets in the shotgun? No, I don't.

396
01:13:52,699 --> 01:14:02,340
All right. I got to be smart about this. Oh my God. They're running through. What is this?

397
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:10,310
What is this? Corn or wheat? What is this? Oh, God. He's right there. Um, can I jump over this?

398
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:15,850
All right. Just a, it's like blinding. I think the flower blinds them.

399
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:25,819
If I would take a wild guess. Here we go. All right. Reload this shit right now.

400
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:54,819
Well, how many arms do I have? Perhaps some ammo. Ammo. Gunpowder and rusted scrap.

401
01:14:55,460 --> 01:15:12,789
Did I have wasted that? Did I waste it? Shit. Well, whatever. I'm going. Can't jump over this?

402
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:31,300
How do you not jump over that? I don't, how are you that can't jump over that? Okay. Here we go.

403
01:15:33,750 --> 01:16:34,569
Ouch. My foot. Oh, I hate when they do that move. I step on his head. Yeah. I'm getting too close.

404
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:53,619
You think so? Ammo. Make it good. So much ammo. Just use the one. Okay. I want to go this way.

405
01:16:54,180 --> 01:17:15,180
He thinks he's playing resident evil four. Do I? I got two heels. Oh, I'm not going to heal.

406
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:20,710
Why would I heal right now? I feel like there's something in the middle of that field.

407
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:32,220
Yeah. He's eating something. What is he eating? Should I just kill him? Will he notice me if I

408
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:53,380
don't do anything weird? Who the fuck is this? What? What? It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

409
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,619
I'm just glad to see normal people at last. Have you seen any other survivors?

410
01:17:59,989 --> 01:18:04,229
They're all in Louisa's house and she's not answering and the gate is locked.

411
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:16,460
Quiet. He's an outsider. Oh shit. We're sitting ducks in here. Can your old man walk?

412
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:24,199
No, one of the monsters cut him. He's lost a lot of blood. We have to get into Louisa's house.

413
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,640
Quiet. Fucking alone. We're going to kill us. Let's be away inside.

414
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,119
When the outsider is sus. Be quiet. Don't move until I get those gates open.

415
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:35,079
My eyes just rolled back in my head and I think it caused permanent damage to them.

416
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:53,050
Can I have that? I'll trade you a knife for that. Okay. They're all in their own Louisa's house.

417
01:18:53,050 --> 01:19:14,470
It's down here. I don't know. Good ammo. I need it. What is that? Well, gunpowder. Nice. All right.

418
01:19:15,529 --> 01:19:21,880
On the roof. Take on the roof. When are we going to see the big sus lady? I don't know.

419
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:49,590
Oh, this is Louisa's house. Let's go. And no. Out of one of the crests is in there.

420
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:52,630
I could probably open it. What? I could probably open it by removing a screw.

421
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,869
Okay. I need like, I need a screwdriver. There's definitely a screwdriver in this house.

422
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:08,039
By the way, how does it look with the 3090? Did you get those two inside?

423
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:17,579
Looks like shit. Looks like total dog shit. Come on. It's clear.

424
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:27,779
Hurry. Took your damn time. You're welcome.

425
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:34,869
You have an RTX on? No, because I'm afraid of overheating it.

426
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:43,430
Because one of my fans in the front of the case doesn't work. We'll be safe in here. Won't we?

427
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:50,310
Safer here than out there. That's for sure. Hey, do you know anything about what's going on around

428
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:57,020
here? It doesn't make any sense. Mother Miranda has always protected us. Nobody's answer.

429
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:15,140
Father, we have to get inside. Audio cut off. Just hold on a bit longer, Papa.

430
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:27,659
The audio. All right, we have to get inside. Hello? Anybody home? Maybe a familiar voice.

431
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:37,319
Louisa, open up. It's me, Elena. Stop shouting. You'll draw the monsters.

432
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:40,439
I thought it was the same guy. Who's this? A friend. Stay back.

433
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:46,520
I thought it was the shotgun guy. No, they'll smell the blood. You'll endanger us all.

434
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:53,050
And no sudden movements. I learned how to aim from my father. Hold Ernest.

435
01:21:54,649 --> 01:22:03,079
I would just run at him if I heard that. Go on. Go inside. Come now. This way. You're not from this

436
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:19,880
village. No, I'm Ethan. Julian, go make yourself useful and check the grounds. I said go. If Elena

437
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:31,619
trusts you, then so do I. Come inside, Ethan. Where's the huge lady? I'll check on the others.

438
01:22:36,979 --> 01:22:44,789
They're gonna eat me. They're broken again. Got more of the livestock. I don't think we'll make

439
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:56,899
it through winter at this rate. Ernest is still... You guys know Ernest? Ernest is still missing too.

440
01:22:56,899 --> 01:23:07,899
We can't find him anywhere. Has Mother Miranda abandoned us? Are you kidding me? Okay, whatever.

441
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:14,899
Did it tell me that before and I just... No, I don't think so.

442
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:33,060
Rotate your saves. Yeah, I will. Hold on. Let me look at this. Can I get a closer look? Oh,

443
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:47,529
whatever. These nice photos. Whatever. I don't care. Right this way. Who are the presidents?

444
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:54,420
Two presidents on the wall. Come inside. The others are waiting.

445
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:04,010
Outsiders, you're gonna get us all killed. He helped Leonardo and Elena.

446
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:12,869
We ourselves? Please, Ethan. Take a seat. Emergency meeting. Right in the front of that table.

447
01:24:12,869 --> 01:24:22,810
I don't like that guy. In your entire village? All that's... There is no one. A worthless

448
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:32,359
invalid. A stupid, wailing bitch. And you! You drag a bloody man and an outsider in here like

449
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:37,159
it's nothing? I don't know. And expect to be all safe? They're all like around a table. There is no

450
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:53,770
safe. Sorry bastard out there has been ripped in half. Just like her damn husband.

451
01:24:54,649 --> 01:25:00,970
Put a sock in it, Roxana. That's enough. This house has protected my family for generations.

452
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:11,880
And drunk or not, you are all welcome and safe in here. Whatever. Can someone please tell me

453
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:19,159
what the hell is going on here? We don't know. One day we were a quiet, devout village and the next

454
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:27,909
the monsters came and attacked us. And they kept coming. Wait, Louisa. Where is your husband?

455
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:39,979
Did they? No. No, he is out there. Somewhere. He went to get help. Yes, yes, that's...

456
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:44,380
I feel like this is an elaborate escape room that I like paid a bunch of money to do.

457
01:25:44,380 --> 01:26:03,460
Let us pray. For him. For all of us. Good idea. Like, oh! I was gonna start clicking the lights.

458
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:12,020
Hear our voice, together as one in reverence. We call on thee, within the endless dark,

459
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:18,739
to deliver us into fate's hands. As the midnight moon rises on black wings,

460
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:29,770
so we make our sacrifice. Or stand up. In life and in death, we give you glory,

461
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:38,170
Mother Miranda. Now, the tea should be ready. The alien's gonna come out of that guy. Come help me,

462
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:42,329
Elena, please. This guy's gonna... He's gonna punch her inside of his chest. I've heard it before.

463
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:52,970
There was an old woman near the graveyard. Crazy as a bag of rice. There is wisdom

464
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:58,470
in her devotion, though. And I hope it protected her, as it shall protect us.

465
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:21,210
Sorry. I thought... I thought the fucking monster was gonna come out of him.

466
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:28,060
So I was trying to time the photo. I'm sorry. Whatever.

467
01:27:35,770 --> 01:28:16,600
I got it! How do I move the camera? This guy's face over here. Filters. Oh, wow, that's scary.

468
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:50,100
I don't like any of these. Yellow? This looks like a loading screen for this game. Turn the grid off.

469
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:56,810
Okay. All right, that looks good. Why can I not change the camera shit? Adjust the scope of the

470
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:10,649
camera. What's going on here? And now, control, hide HUD. F. Photo. It's because it's a cut scene.

471
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:21,850
Oh, okay. All right, cool. F. Got it. When I hit escape, is this just gonna...

472
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:59,300
I gotta be ready for this. I missed that second one. It's why I blocked! I hit the block button!

473
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:13,909
All right, I have to stop doing this. Why did you tell me I could do this? I know. I'm done.

474
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:18,310
I'm not doing it anymore. No more. I'm done. I'm not doing this ever again. I promise I'm not

475
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:24,279
gonna do it again. Ever again. I swear to God. I promise. I'm not gonna do it again. I'm done.

476
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:35,829
It's over. Don't even do it. I wanted the shotgun to shoot him in the face. Yeah, I didn't do it. See?

477
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:46,680
I'm so sorry, father. Hey, hey, that wasn't your father anymore. You did the right thing.

478
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,720
Was he infected? I don't get it. There's nothing you can do. This entire place is collapsing.

479
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:11,859
We couldn't save him. He was already gone. Leave me alone. No, we're getting out of here together.

480
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:23,619
We gotta get out of here. Escape. All right, this is where the escape room happens.

481
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:34,250
Oh my God. This is so scary. Whoa, what's that? Hey, hey, there's a five? There's a five written

482
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:44,170
on the ceiling. Write that down. Under the car. I got a seven over here on the tire.

483
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:55,529
Maybe there's a padlock. Oh, wait, this is the house that was from the beginning of the game.

484
01:31:55,529 --> 01:32:14,659
Whoa, that's a lot of money. I'll take 500 bucks. Why not? Take the screwdriver out of the key ring

485
01:32:14,659 --> 01:32:19,100
if you need it. I'm really, you know, this company, this escape room company, they leave

486
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:43,029
little helpful, helpful clues. Truck key. Examine items. I examine. What is that? Damn it. I was so

487
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:58,970
hoping like a four was going to be written on this key for some reason. Oh well. Okay,

488
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:05,180
I got the screwdriver. What else we got here? Shotgun ammo. Let me make sure it's loaded.

489
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:23,609
One, two. Good. This has been explored. Let's check this side. Cool. Oh, I'm not going up

490
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:25,609
there yet. I think there's something in here. Yeah, there's something in here.

491
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:37,979
Something. There's a fire in here, but wait a minute. What about here? Come on. There's

492
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:57,539
gotta be like one of those shining things, right? A jewel? What the fuck? It's like that's a jewel

493
01:33:57,539 --> 01:34:12,140
right there, isn't it? Isn't that a jewel? Shit. Where is this? There's something in here.

494
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:22,199
Oh, here we go. If we could just get through this wall. No, no, I can't. Whatever. If I,

495
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:44,649
if I, if I can't, whatever. Audit plant. Nice. Oh shit. We're like fucking dying.

496
01:34:45,529 --> 01:34:52,680
All right. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

497
01:34:52,680 --> 01:35:23,909
Let's go. Go. Go get in. Get in the car. Stop reading chat. No. Hit the gas. Well,

498
01:35:23,909 --> 01:35:46,170
that didn't work. Are we driving up the stairs? Did I think this was a Bugs Bunny cartoon? What

499
01:35:46,170 --> 01:36:04,979
the fuck am I doing? Wait, what? The car? Oh, grab on. Hurry. You know, the craziest thing

500
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:12,300
probably could have used this car or something. Let's move and try not to breathe in the smoke.

501
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:24,420
I know. Thank you. All right. Move. I do too. Move. Move. Help me move this. Maybe you'll get to

502
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:32,380
meet them. This guy's fucking clumped. He's like Mr. Magoo.

503
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:48,970
Window.

504
01:37:08,539 --> 01:37:19,500
Don't press P. I was hoping he was going to do the thing with like the stunt man. Wait.

505
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:38,680
Don't hit P. Don't hit P. I'm going to hit P. I'm going to hit P. I'm going to

506
01:37:50,539 --> 01:37:54,970
rip P off the keyboard. I'm going to rip P off. I'm going to rip P off the keyboard, I think.

507
01:37:54,970 --> 01:38:03,300
I won't stop. I have to take P off the keyboard, I think. I'm so annoyed with myself that I'm

508
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:07,779
doing that. No more. Don't do that shit anymore. It's not fucking funny. Don't do it anymore. You

509
01:38:07,779 --> 01:38:14,220
don't fucking do that anymore, right? All right. All right. Don't fucking do it anymore. I just

510
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:35,100
don't get it. Let's go. Jump. This place is going mad. Why the fuck is this happening again?

511
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:43,460
Oh, what the fuck? Shit. That would have been awesome if that like cratered with his fist and

512
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,460
like the wood bent and broke and made like an explosion sound. He figured out that he had like

513
01:38:47,460 --> 01:39:10,010
fucking powers. Capcom, what have you done? Hey. All right. I got to get the thing out of here.

514
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:18,260
Use the screwdriver. I'm really low on health. I need a save point too. This is not,

515
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:36,359
this is kind of getting ugly. Okay. Let's go in the castle. I used to just get this. When I

516
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:41,239
used to play like PUBG on my mobile device, you would hear that and you'd just be like,

517
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:50,539
where is this guy? He's fucking like 500 miles away. And I would stand still and he would still

518
01:39:50,539 --> 01:39:57,979
miss. And that's how I knew if he was shooting at me, right? I didn't even care if I lost or died.

519
01:39:57,979 --> 01:40:00,939
If I was standing still and I didn't get hit, then he was aiming at somebody else

520
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:07,500
and he doesn't even potentially even see me.

521
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:23,880
Who's there? What was that?

522
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:33,579
Chills. Anything else I missed? I have explored pretty much everything.

523
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:39,750
Although the plot. No, that, okay. I thought that was telling me like to go this way because the

524
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:56,010
plot is that way to like keep the story going. These guys are all dead, right? I need a typewriter.

525
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:21,640
Dad has visited them all.

526
01:41:33,939 --> 01:41:46,359
This is just a MOBA character select screen. That's the one line and then she's sitting there

527
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:55,449
doing her little animation. And like the fucking stadium is screaming because they can't believe

528
01:41:55,449 --> 01:42:02,439
that. Like, wow. What a counterpick. This is a low tier character. I'm getting too out of control

529
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:25,510
here. Oh, that's wrong. Wait, where is this? Oh, out here. Yeah. Death. Death.

530
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:51,000
Hey, get in there. Seth, behind you. Oh, it's Otto. What's the matter? Do you need something, Otto?

531
01:42:57,770 --> 01:43:08,060
What is it? You see his tail? What is it? What is it? Hey, come over here. They can't see you.

532
01:43:08,779 --> 01:43:13,050
Hold on. Let me just make sure I have pants on. Come here.

533
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:37,609
I can see you on cam. And when he's running out, he was like, fuck Capcom. I was like, wow,

534
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:48,250
holy shit, dude. What happened? Why did he even say that? What was that for? It was kind of rude.

535
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:56,489
It's like they make good games and shit. All right. Let me in. Here we go. We're going to meet

536
01:43:56,489 --> 01:44:08,520
lady of the castle. Can't wait for the nothing but blood and death. And she's probably going to go

537
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:30,819
like this and like cool herself off of it. Right. It's just cord. It's cords going. Is that

538
01:44:30,819 --> 01:44:39,380
electricity? Am I going to get zapped? Come on. There's something under here. Right. Why would

539
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:50,819
they have this? Are we for later? I hear something in the water. What's in the water? I just heard

540
01:44:50,819 --> 01:45:14,060
that. What is that for? A rope? It was you. I didn't sound like me. Whoa. You guys can't see

541
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:38,659
how much ammo I have. Right. I wish I should. Does it matter? Lower left is now you can actually see

542
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:43,989
how much ammo I have. Save the game. I mean, I'm I doesn't know where I can save right now.

543
01:45:47,590 --> 01:46:00,659
In the middle looks weird. Top right. I don't like top right. Flipped it. Yeah. Well, because now

544
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:05,779
if I'm looking at that way, that would be weird. I don't want to be looking this way because I need

545
01:46:05,779 --> 01:46:25,510
to be looking at the game. Does it look weird? Turn it back, please. I think this is all right.

546
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:32,729
Wait, that does look kind of weird, doesn't it? Top right doesn't feel right to me, though.

547
01:46:32,729 --> 01:46:44,699
It always feels weird. Right now. I hate that. I actually I actually hate that. I could go like

548
01:46:44,699 --> 01:46:55,939
here. Where's the where's it come up? That's fine. I'm not I don't hate that. Right. That's OK.

549
01:46:56,579 --> 01:47:03,079
There's nothing wrong with that. But that kind of then you don't get to see like kind of this side

550
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:19,100
of the screen, though, whatever. Well, you think anyone was left must be pretty tough.

551
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:27,859
Who the fuck are you? Oh, you're not local. Better.

552
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:42,229
Mother Miranda is going to love you guys. It sounds like Elvis.

553
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:59,060
Oh, Mother Miranda is going to love you when you're whining. We're almost there.

554
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:11,619
Where? Oh, what have you brought me? He's going to walk in. Oh, what have you brought me, darling?

555
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:37,140
It's to anyone else. My daughter's and I. Shut the fuck up. Where? You mean you'll screw around

556
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:42,180
with it in private. Where's the fun in that? Give it to me and I'll put on a show that everybody

557
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:49,539
can enjoy. Oh, so gauche. What do we care for bread and circuses? The man thinks suffering is a

558
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:53,380
gag. The man's dick is cut off in the castle. Blah, blah, blah.

559
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:01,539
Fuck is going on. I've heard all your arguments. Some of you were less persuasive than others,

560
01:49:01,539 --> 01:49:10,600
but I've made my decision. Heisenberg, the man's fate is in your hands. Mother Miranda, I must

561
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:18,920
protest. Heisenberg is but a child and his devotion to you is questionable. Give the mortal to me and

562
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:25,960
I will ensure he is ready. Shut your damn mouth and don't be a sore loser. You'll find your food

563
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:31,319
somewhere else. Quiet now, child. What are the Avengers? They're like the evil Avengers.

564
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:34,760
You're the one who's arguing with Miranda's decision. You wouldn't know responsibility

565
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,840
if it was welded to them. Oh, keep growling. One day your head might actually fit your ego.

566
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:45,560
Fight, fight, fight. Hey, don't I get a say in this? Silence. My decision is final.

567
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:58,340
Remember from whence you came. Lichens and gentlemen,

568
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:11,020
we thank you for winning. And now let the games begin. Let's see what you have here, Ethan. Get

569
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:28,619
ready. Get ready. You missed. Nine, eight, seven. I didn't get any water. I just needed water.

570
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,739
One sip of water. All right.

571
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:57,050
This is a game. It's a game to them. It's a game. Whoa. It's a fucking game.

572
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:41,289
Why do I keep duck? Oh shit. I didn't duck. It's a game show. No, no, no, no, no. Joel already made

573
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:58,329
that joke. Fuck. I should have played this a week ago. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

574
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:22,649
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Who says? Who said that? Open. Open. Break it.

575
01:52:23,609 --> 01:52:46,199
Break it. What happened? What just happened? What?

576
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:01,609
I was trying to break the box. I couldn't break it. Break. Break. No, wrong way. Oh, I just. I

577
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:18,470
can't even. Wait. Oh, no. Never mind. I was about to do like a bit, but I cut it off. This is so loud.

578
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:23,670
I got to turn this down. Oh my God. Like I'm talking way louder than I normally would be.

579
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:54,060
Sorry. Building all this bullshit. All right. So I can't break that shit.

580
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:09,109
Okay. Wait a minute. So what's going on here? I can't break those. So I just have to run.

581
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:45,609
I don't think I can break them. Does it go this far? Whoa. Chill.

582
01:54:54,789 --> 01:55:02,279
300 bucks. Handgun ammo. I've had my weapons too. Well, you tell me I couldn't like pick that up.

583
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:05,720
No, I couldn't have. Never mind. I could have shot the handgun though.

584
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:17,960
And you tell me I couldn't have shot the handgun. Is that going to move?

585
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:26,090
That's going to move. All right. Oh my God. All this is. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay.

586
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:45,850
Uh, it's going to drop. It's going to drop. God. I made it. All right. How is he communicating

587
01:55:45,850 --> 01:56:08,380
with me by the way? I'm confused about that. The speaker. This is just a saw game. I mean,

588
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:15,350
it kind of is. It's good so far. I like it. Don't take the first five minutes of this game. What I

589
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:27,130
said just to turn if I like this game. Big burps. All right. So now we just got to go back in there

590
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:32,979
and just wait, go back to where we just were and just go through and like wipe the sweat off my

591
01:56:32,979 --> 01:56:50,039
brown be like, all right, I did it. Got to be something over here, right? He's going to have

592
01:56:50,039 --> 01:56:56,329
a stopwatch. He's going to be like, there you are. Record time. Something like that. Right.

593
01:56:56,329 --> 01:57:06,899
That was like a test. See if I'm worthy to be the next Avenger. I've been waiting for you, Mr.

594
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:15,300
Winter. How do you know my name? Anyone who's anyone has heard of the likes of you. A hero

595
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:23,460
searching for his daughter. I must say that castle arouses suspicion. These are fairy tale

596
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:31,300
characters. This is like Humpty Dumpty. This is fairy tale characters, right?

597
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:39,619
Call me the Duke. Now to business. Weapons, ammunition, healing salves, anything you desire.

598
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:46,460
Holy shit. You really let yourself go since Resident Evil 4. I can't wait to buy something

599
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:57,930
happen. Be like, Oh, wow. Thank you. It's right. The same guy. I was just thinking of ways to pass

600
01:57:57,930 --> 01:58:08,699
the time. Plies, guns, smithy, the Duke's purse. Everything has. Okay. What about supplies and

601
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:12,300
thousand extra baggage, increased number of item slots available in your inventory.

602
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:23,060
I only have 910 bucks. Shotgun ammo. Learn how to make shotgun ammo. That's really huge.

603
01:58:23,699 --> 01:58:33,670
Sniper rifle, ammo, mines. All right. This is cool. Gun smithy. Oh no. I have to pick what I want.

604
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:43,590
I can't even afford any of this, but, Oh, I know people are going to be like, dude, you don't do

605
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:58,890
that handgun. Pick this other gun. Crystal. Ooh, I can sell that for two grand. 12,000 for the

606
01:58:58,890 --> 01:59:04,569
shotgun. What if I just sell this and make the handgun awesome? That'd be kind of cool, right?

607
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:11,880
Don't dump dump. Well, I'm going to sell the crystal fragment. Why wouldn't I?

608
01:59:14,279 --> 01:59:28,579
How do I sell it? No, don't. No, I knew this was going to happen. I just knew this was going to

609
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:33,140
happen. I knew I was going to, I was going to sell the crystal. What? Let me guess. You can put like

610
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:37,220
three crystals in like a crown and then the three crystal crown becomes like 50 grand.

611
01:59:37,859 --> 01:59:49,989
White mineral found in this region could probably sell it valuable. I'm just selling it. I don't

612
01:59:49,989 --> 01:59:55,800
care. Get mad. Everyone's going to get angry about this, but I'm just selling it. I'm buying this

613
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:59,479
because of our relationship, you know? Whatever. If I get it wrong, I get it wrong.

614
02:00:00,279 --> 02:00:07,689
It literally says component. Securing goods is more important than anything. All right. Now

615
02:00:07,689 --> 02:00:12,810
let's see. What do I got? Can I upgrade? Wait, I want to, how much is shotgun ammo? 3000. I need

616
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:28,779
100. I'm going to sell some stuff. Okay. I'm going to sell. How much do I need? You can sell

617
02:00:28,779 --> 02:00:40,140
anything that says valuable, but don't sell things that say combinable. All right. I just need 90.

618
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:49,479
I'm going to sell six handguns. Little and often fills the purse as they say.

619
02:00:50,199 --> 02:00:56,279
Okay. Now I want to buy, I want to be able to make 3000. Make shotgun ammo. That's huge. That's

620
02:00:56,279 --> 02:01:01,960
really important. I want it. I see. Anything else? Okay. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons

621
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:09,560
modifications and we'll do them until next we meet. All right. What does it take to make

622
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:17,960
shotgun ammo? Gunpowder, rusted scrap and chem fluid. Oh, that's a lot. I think in my head,

623
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:28,090
you have to restart. Hey, thank you. Hey, you already fucked it. Oh, oh, that's cool. I need

624
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:38,199
to save the game. Sell ammo to get ammo. Well, yeah, I want to be able to craft shotguns. Are

625
02:01:38,199 --> 02:01:41,800
you telling me that the shotgun ammo crafting ability is more important than like six handgun

626
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:47,350
bullets? I'm probably going to need it like right now. I'm at the last boss. This is the

627
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:51,670
game's almost over. This is the demo guys. The game didn't even fucking come out. I don't know

628
02:01:51,670 --> 02:02:13,449
what everyone's freaking out for. It's behind the curtain. Could Rose be here? Three daughters,

629
02:02:13,449 --> 02:02:24,039
Bella, Cassandra and Daniella. Mm hmm. Okay. Mm hmm. Uh, January 5th, uh, redneck delivery of one

630
02:02:24,039 --> 02:02:30,039
male, three females, a Miranda meeting with mistress Dimitrescu. How do I pronounce this?

631
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:46,949
Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, the Duke business discussions. Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu,

632
02:02:47,029 --> 02:02:56,520
Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu. Yeah. Dimitrescu.

633
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:06,489
Dimitrek. I not how you say this is a big house. Okay, hold on. Well, let's go away. What about

634
02:03:06,489 --> 02:03:14,680
over here? Don't step on that. You like always step on wooden fall. Ooh, what's this? 500 bucks. I

635
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:22,260
could have saved that money. Whatever. Nothing happens. I'm going to turn that on later. All

636
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:32,439
right. Let's keep going. It's like an elevator room. They say it in the game. They do. You're a

637
02:03:32,439 --> 02:03:43,000
liar. I, I guarantee they don't say Dimitrescu one time in the whole game. I bet you one wink

638
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:56,119
that they don't. Now remember, I don't think they say, like I could say it and like other characters,

639
02:03:56,119 --> 02:03:59,479
but I'm talking about like the Dimitrescu family is not going to say Dimitrescu the whole game.

640
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:14,890
Like I'm lady Dimitrescu. No. All right. That's good. Hang on anymore. That was weird.

641
02:04:15,449 --> 02:04:36,979
They literally said it. No, but for us again, my baby, that was the baby scream. Okay. Hall,

642
02:04:36,979 --> 02:04:56,170
hall of the four. What is that? Oh, and mask the angels blinded gaze and you'll eat a shitload of

643
02:04:56,170 --> 02:05:21,960
bugs. Hey, what the fuck? This guy's life sucks.

644
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:49,460
Mother, I bring you fresh prey. You are so kind to me, daughters. Now let's take a look at him.

645
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:57,430
Wow. Well, Ethan Winters, you escaped my little brother's idiot games. Did you?

646
02:05:58,789 --> 02:06:03,109
Let's see how special. I don't want to play any more games. Yes, mother.

647
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:10,140
Can you just get out? Can we talk? Like why do I have to play games?

648
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:26,220
Starting to go a little stale. Then let's devour his man flesh quickly, mother. I am the one who

649
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:30,859
captured him. No, no, daughters. First. I must inform mother Miranda,

650
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:36,699
but later. Well, there will be enough for everyone.

651
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:45,380
Do vampires have like a blood filter? Like we filter water. Like wouldn't that just be the

652
02:06:45,380 --> 02:07:00,039
equivalent of like drinking out of the sewer? I don't know. I feel like it's dirty. You need

653
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:16,250
like a vampire Britta. What the fuck was that? What was that? What was that thing? What was she

654
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:35,270
smelling? What was she just sitting at? What the fuck was that? All right. So if I sit here for 15

655
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:46,100
minutes, I don't do anything. The main character bad guy from fall out, fall guys. What's the game?

656
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:53,159
I've ruined the joke already. Well, what's the name of the fucking game? Far cry. I gotta get

657
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:57,319
out of here before they come back. Whatever. I was gonna say he kicks the door and he's like,

658
02:07:57,319 --> 02:08:15,739
Hey, remember me? And then he lets me out. Whatever. It would have been funny. I couldn't

659
02:08:15,739 --> 02:08:24,619
even think of the name. They're all like far cry. Far out. Fall out. Fall guys. Fall cry. Cry far.

660
02:08:24,619 --> 02:08:47,609
Like how many? Whatever. His poor guy's hands kind of wish like, Oh, his fingers would be like,

661
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:57,130
like, Oh, cool. That'd be totally video game of this. Wouldn't it? By the way, why did I

662
02:08:57,130 --> 02:09:04,020
wink? She didn't say it. She didn't say Dimitra Sue. That one was free. It was in glass.

663
02:09:04,739 --> 02:09:19,460
It was a free wing. All right, there's a big lever here. I take that. Okay. Hold on. I have

664
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:24,020
yet to understand what the fucking goal is because every time I walk in a room, one of the main

665
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:27,460
characters is like, Oh, let's play with him. And then there's no goal. They just like do something

666
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:46,060
weird and leave. Look for Rose in the castle. Okay. Easy to pick lock. I need a lock pick.

667
02:09:46,619 --> 02:10:06,039
Get in there. Oh, secret hidden tunnel. Not yet. Hold on. That's probably stuff. Yeah. This like

668
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:12,760
something in here. Books, things to read. Can I leave? Can I just open the door? Of course not.

669
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,640
All right. Well, I, there's a locked lock pick thing right there. I was going to come back with

670
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:26,859
a lock pick and let's go. By the way, I think since using the 3090, I think this room has

671
02:10:26,859 --> 02:10:35,140
increased its temperature by five full degrees. I need like an air conditioning unit or my computer.

672
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:39,460
I swear to God, I think it's probably 80 plus degrees in here right now.

673
02:10:39,460 --> 02:11:00,020
Scrap. Okay. I can make, um, some stuff. Pick up the baby. Rune eye ring. Throw your case. No,

674
02:11:00,579 --> 02:11:06,010
I don't, I'm not, I don't want to do that. You guys are like, make fun of my cable management

675
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:12,520
or something. It'll always be something. Throw your case. Oh, wow. Nice cable management. Like

676
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:27,930
whatever. I don't care. Okay. We know the bed chamber is a hall of the four, which is,

677
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:33,510
oh, wait, I can open this door now. Wait, is that the coin in here going to break this

678
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:48,779
crystal fragment? Hell yeah. All right. And where's the next, um, wait,

679
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:55,449
turn on ray tracing for just a little bit. I don't know. It'll get, it'll be a hundred degrees in

680
02:11:55,449 --> 02:12:10,520
here. Ray tracing is a meme guys. It doesn't matter. All right. So that's like a little

681
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:20,539
shortcut to the bed chamber. I mean, like it's cool, but it's really cool. Well, I don't know.

682
02:12:20,539 --> 02:12:27,000
I don't really care to like increase my like graphics card energy consumption by like 150%

683
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:33,899
to like have the floors be reflective. I don't, I don't care. I would, I would, I have my like

684
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:39,739
comfort in this room of it being 80 degrees, way more, put it, I put it so much higher than

685
02:12:39,739 --> 02:12:48,250
like a reflective screen, like a reflective mirror. This shit will be roasting in here.

686
02:12:48,250 --> 02:13:00,600
It's cool. I don't hate it, but I need like a fucking car exhaust on here. Ask the angels,

687
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:15,210
blind the gaze, the ring. Okay. Mask the angels, blind the gaze. Oh, this is okay. I'll figure

688
02:13:15,210 --> 02:13:25,300
that out later. This is like the ultimate puzzle. Probably. Let's go up. It seems to be the place

689
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:47,670
to go. It's a cool house. Nice. I got to save money. How many suits of armor? This is, that's

690
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:52,819
weird. I have a suit of armor. This many suits of armor in your house. It's too many. I can understand

691
02:13:52,819 --> 02:14:09,239
one more than one is very strange than a T that lipstick of blood or both. Why would you drink

692
02:14:09,239 --> 02:14:15,819
blood? Okay. Is it weird that I find it less disgusting if they were to literally cook me

693
02:14:15,819 --> 02:14:20,779
and eat me than if they were to drink my blood while I'm alive? I find that to be like just less

694
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:34,489
gross. Can I unlock this? I can. Excellent. All right. So now there's a way to get around this

695
02:14:34,489 --> 02:14:54,170
whole house. Let's go up here. I'm going up. I hear something moving. Wine room. Ooh,

696
02:14:55,130 --> 02:15:06,899
this is going to be blood. All right. I can make shotgun. Whoa. I can be 30. Whoa. No, I can't. I

697
02:15:06,899 --> 02:15:18,310
need two rusted scrap. Shit. Wait. How many rusted scrap do I have? Just one. Why am I making tech?

698
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:26,729
Whatever. I don't care. Put the ring on it. You can't use that. What? Like a gravy boat?

699
02:15:28,069 --> 02:15:30,789
All right. I got to like put gravy in the gravy boat or whatever I need to do.

700
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:44,680
I got to remember this. The French champagne. It's always been celebrated for its excellence.

701
02:15:45,689 --> 02:15:56,329
There is a California champagne by Paul Marceau. I love that guy. Ring. Maroon eye ring. You can't

702
02:15:56,329 --> 02:16:09,529
use this as is. Why not take the eye out? Can I like examine it? Okay. Maroon eye. All right.

703
02:16:09,529 --> 02:16:20,810
I know where that goes. Say Aaron. Okay. I'll do a Kickstarter campaign for 1.4 million dollars.

704
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:36,819
And if it gets to 1.4 million, I will say Aaron on stream. How's that sound? I need to save the

705
02:16:36,819 --> 02:16:56,100
game very, very badly. I've not saved the game since. What the fuck? This guy's hands. What? Oh

706
02:16:56,100 --> 02:17:04,090
God. Slice your jugular. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's not do that. I'm not taking a lie.

707
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:09,209
Dad, which would you prefer? Nothing. Neither. No. Can I hide in the closet? I can't hold back

708
02:17:09,209 --> 02:17:32,309
any longer. What do I do? Oh my God. I thought that just said German 985. It's a German 985.

709
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:37,659
It was my first day working at the castle today. I was most shocked to see the other staff were

710
02:17:37,659 --> 02:17:41,739
all women. The mistress and her daughters were very adamant that they wouldn't bite.

711
02:17:41,739 --> 02:17:47,239
It was quite peculiar. It's been two weeks since I started working at the castle and I'm a little

712
02:17:47,239 --> 02:17:52,520
afraid. Another maid, Adela, made a mistake and Miss Daniella slashed her face with a knife.

713
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:57,239
And at night I can hear wailing as if ghosts roam the halls. I want to go home.

714
02:17:57,239 --> 02:18:02,409
I don't know what to do. The young ladies were complaining it was too hot and stuffy during

715
02:18:02,409 --> 02:18:07,370
dinner. So I opened the window, just a crack. Shut it. Shut it now. They all freaked at me in

716
02:18:07,370 --> 02:18:12,819
unison. Looks like I'm gonna have to suffer with my 3090 in my own bedroom in heat.

717
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:17,879
That was funny. I refused to see fucking minus twos. That was actually really funny.

718
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:22,809
I fear I may be taken down into the cellar and never to be seen again. I don't know what to do.

719
02:18:22,809 --> 02:18:26,969
I don't know what to do. That was funny. Don't fucking tell me it wasn't. I know when it was

720
02:18:26,969 --> 02:19:02,569
funny because I know. Okay, now it's funny. Now it's funny. This game is really cool. I'm really

721
02:19:02,569 --> 02:19:23,139
into it. Oh my god, is that Lady Dimitrescu? Hey Cabbagehead, PhD, thanks for the 25 community subs.

722
02:19:23,139 --> 02:19:31,420
That's a lot of money, thank you. Tasting room, thanks for the 25 subs. I just went too far when

723
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:37,719
I looked over at chat. That hurt. Do they chase you around the house? Oh my god, they probably do.

724
02:19:37,719 --> 02:19:54,870
Should I go in that door she just opened? Yeah. Oh my god, is she gonna come back in here? Wait,

725
02:19:54,870 --> 02:20:00,899
something. Hurry, hurry, hurry before she comes back. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I need a typewriter

726
02:20:00,899 --> 02:20:30,260
room. So bad, it's not even funny. Snake in here? They still do that in these games? No. Dump that?

727
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:55,420
Trust in light. All right, light it up. What does that do? Boom, boom, boom, boom. He walks down the

728
02:20:55,420 --> 02:21:18,229
hall with a sledgehammer. Where the hell am I? Fuck, it's covered in dried blood. I don't understand.

729
02:21:18,229 --> 02:21:35,620
Was this like a, was it putting somebody inside of that? Oh, all right, I have to be honest with you.

730
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:42,549
I feel like this would kind of feel kind of good. I have like chest and like back pain issues and

731
02:21:42,549 --> 02:21:46,629
I feel like sitting there and pushing back on those just lightly would hit like a bunch

732
02:21:46,629 --> 02:22:19,530
of pressure points if I didn't do it too hard. You're a freak. All right, I wouldn't want to

733
02:22:19,530 --> 02:22:25,450
put that on somebody. Wouldn't that be fucking terrifying? Like, oh yeah, go get the pig mask

734
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:32,040
thing. No, no, I don't want to do that. That's scary, man. Like that's fucking terrifying to me.

735
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:39,829
Can't we just like beat the shit out of him? Why do we have to like put like a fucking weird

736
02:22:39,829 --> 02:22:51,930
mask on him? I don't, I don't want to do that. Help me. It's a horror game. I know, but like I'm

737
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:57,500
just saying like that's, they used to do all kinds of fucked up shit back in like the medieval times

738
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:08,469
and stuff. It's like, why would you want to do that? Like look at all this stuff. I don't want

739
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:13,590
to like pull somebody's fucking teeth out while they sit on like a bunch of spikes and nails.

740
02:23:14,309 --> 02:23:39,909
I missed a save point. I did. Where? I just closed myself in a cell next to the angel.

741
02:23:42,090 --> 02:24:19,180
Where? Hold on a second. This is a cool photo. Focus area right up, right up in the front.

742
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:37,819
Actually cool. It's a cool photo. Hold on. I wish I could actually use, scroll with this.

743
02:24:37,819 --> 02:24:41,659
Wow, this is such a weird way to do this. Focus area. I want it like back.

744
02:24:45,530 --> 02:25:04,620
Why can't I go back with the focus area? There you go. Okay. It's a console port. Blur strength.

745
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:10,899
Yeah, I want it to be like blurry up here. Focus area. Where is this focus area?

746
02:25:11,459 --> 02:25:17,000
I don't even know what the fuck they're trying to tell me. Please play the game. I'm, this is,

747
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:24,250
I'm taking a, I took a picture in photo mode. I want to do this. I can't take five fucking,

748
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:27,450
less than five seconds to do this. I mean, it's been like probably two minutes, but still.

749
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:44,700
I think, I think it's a cool photo. Wait, I didn't know I could do these.

750
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:56,950
I could have had a newspaper for the, I could have had it on this animal display.

751
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:15,780
All right. That's cool. All right. I went in here. I don't want to miss.

752
02:26:16,659 --> 02:26:25,739
I must have fireworks. Why would you do this to somebody?

753
02:26:38,649 --> 02:26:45,049
Arena. Robust appetite. Mahala. Robust appetite. Lois.

754
02:26:48,040 --> 02:27:04,819
Ingrid. Unstable. Overly alert at times. Somebody just said, bye. Bye. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

755
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:22,860
You're giving me a lot of shotgun bullets here. All right. What the fuck is that?

756
02:27:23,579 --> 02:27:35,000
You want how to make this way scarier? I have just singing in the background,

757
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:40,899
the person, whoever this is just going like the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spot.

758
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:54,889
Down came the rain and watched the spider like twinkle, twinkle little star.

759
02:27:55,770 --> 02:28:44,120
I need a typewriter. Why are you alive? Oh, money. Let me hit their head.

760
02:28:44,120 --> 02:29:04,069
Hey, are you fucking invincible or what is going on here? How many times have I

761
02:29:04,069 --> 02:29:14,870
shoot you in the head? All right. Get the money. Where the? Get the money. Get the money. Get the

762
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:29,260
money. Pipe bomb. Well, that would have been nice to use that. Wouldn't it have? Why is it doing the

763
02:29:29,260 --> 02:30:11,379
fucking like cockroach sound? Where am I going? Stop doing the music. Stop the music. Pipe bomb.

764
02:30:11,379 --> 02:30:40,500
Pipe bomb. Hey, browsing zebra. Thanks for the 20 immunity subs. Appreciate it.

765
02:30:41,059 --> 02:30:59,479
Oh, I got a necklace. God damn it. I mean, this stuff, I want, I want to make sure I have tons

766
02:30:59,479 --> 02:31:09,719
of ammo and tons of weapons and shit. Oh, like mother wasn't feeling well. This is just every

767
02:31:09,719 --> 02:31:18,409
new, like 2020 plus 2019 horror movie trailer. This goes done, done, done. They're like dinner,

768
02:31:19,739 --> 02:31:29,780
like eating, done. She changed. She was changing done. And that shows like the company's name,

769
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:49,829
the logo, still skull. Otto's not in here, right? I feel like I'm going to scare the shit out of

770
02:31:49,829 --> 02:32:05,420
him. He is produced by the makers of get out. Yeah. Hannah just gave 30. What's one of the

771
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:13,020
community subs? 30 community subs from Hannah. Thank you. That's a shit load of subs. There's

772
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:25,780
like about like 150 subs have come in. I guess give me so much money. That was scary. Another

773
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:30,979
one of these doors that I cannot go into. Eventually I'll get whatever that is. Whatever

774
02:32:31,059 --> 02:32:35,700
that would have a medallion that is. Thanks. That's a lot. Thank you, Hannah.

775
02:32:44,649 --> 02:32:56,569
God, I need a typewriter. We typewriter. I'm not healthy. I'm very unhealthy right now.

776
02:32:56,569 --> 02:33:00,409
Actually, you know, not even a bar of chocolate and cheeseburgers. I ate the last few years.

777
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:07,340
I need that. Whatever it is. Which tools do you prefer? I prefer

778
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:14,459
the

779
02:33:15,579 --> 02:33:19,579
I'm okay. I'm okay. Drink the poison, whatever it is. Poison, poison, eat the poison.

780
02:33:26,459 --> 02:33:43,620
No, I'm just picking up random items. Open it. Don't use those.

781
02:33:49,370 --> 02:34:02,120
It's light. Light. Holy shit. Light makes you able to be injured.

782
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:19,270
I won't give you. Light allows me to fire at them. Die. Did I run?

783
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:53,579
Oh, did I win? Nice. That was fucking cool. This game is awesome. Besides the FOV.

784
02:34:53,579 --> 02:34:57,180
And I said something very strongly about Capcom earlier and I'm going to backtrack on it. But

785
02:34:57,180 --> 02:35:05,510
like fuck that. What the fuck are they doing? You're getting a lot of good like YouTuber

786
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:18,790
screams, by the way, this stream. Tons of like thumbnail images. I need a typewriter so bad.

787
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:35,459
Sangui. I don't know about that. I have no idea. Another one was sent to the cellar.

788
02:35:35,459 --> 02:35:44,010
She only had spilled some soup. They're evil. All right. I need to how much chem fluid do I have?

789
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:58,649
Just three shotgun shells. I'm going to make it. I need some more chem fluid. That was intense.

790
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:09,819
Look at the name. It's virgin. It's a virgin strawberry. What about a little banana? What

791
02:36:09,819 --> 02:36:34,260
about a little banana? Magic bullet. It can do anything. Save you idiot. I don't know what

792
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:41,319
saving even means. Recoil compensator. There's no typewriter. I haven't seen a typewriter in like

793
02:36:41,319 --> 02:36:49,500
an hour and 20 minutes. I have not seen a single typewriter in 20 minutes. 30 minutes at least.

794
02:36:54,010 --> 02:37:03,000
You missed it. Where is it? Sorry. I was being chased by like a murderous lady. There's a room

795
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:20,940
you missed. Should I hold on to this? This is for the lemmy. Okay. Nice. Recoil dampening.

796
02:37:21,579 --> 02:37:34,809
Just keep moving. You'll get. All right. All right. I'm going to keep moving. Yes.

797
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:47,260
Do I only get one of these? Do I get one? How many do I get? Oh, one. Why did I use it on the

798
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:54,219
most obvious of things? Wooden angel statue. I feel like I picked up a bunch of random shit and

799
02:37:54,219 --> 02:38:03,379
I have absolutely no idea where it goes. I have this. A vintage bottle of wine. Looks like it was

800
02:38:03,379 --> 02:38:12,950
bottled a long time ago. Crystal fragment. Crystal skull. Crystal torso. Crimson glass.

801
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:29,319
Wooden angel. I just have a ton of this stuff. Crystal head vodka. Oh my god. I need a typewriter.

802
02:38:29,319 --> 02:38:36,659
I know it's part of the game. I know that like, look, remember Resident Evil when we had to go

803
02:38:36,659 --> 02:38:41,059
find a typewriter and use ink ribbons and shit. I know it's like, oh, look, it's like nostalgic.

804
02:38:41,059 --> 02:38:54,809
Just give me a fucking exit. Like save game right here. Auto saves. Bad take. It's not.

805
02:38:55,450 --> 02:39:12,979
That's not a bad take. Key items. Wait. I need a special key. Okay. Half of the four.

806
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:34,579
Put the bottle in the gravy. I like it. The typewriter. Just wait. Let's shot that. All right.

807
02:39:35,930 --> 02:39:39,770
They point by the faceless statue. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
02:39:40,889 --> 02:39:58,100
Half of the four. Typewriter. Oh, we meet again. Hello. Duke, why are you here?

809
02:39:59,059 --> 02:40:09,590
Where there's coin to be made. And have you found your daughter? Fake Fiji. If she is truly here,

810
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:15,030
the lady of the castle would have kept little Rose in her private chambers, would she not?

811
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:22,069
Demetresque? The very same. Why don't you take a look? Maybe you'll get lucky.

812
02:40:22,870 --> 02:40:30,309
And speaking of looking, care to make a purchase? It's Demetresque. It's not Demetresu.

813
02:40:34,170 --> 02:40:43,239
It's Demetresu. Demetresu. Demetresque? That's, I am very, very surprised.

814
02:40:45,139 --> 02:40:59,579
Zim and put the wine here. Can't use that here. Craftsman, whatever. Naturally. Okay. Crystal

815
02:40:59,579 --> 02:41:08,170
torso. Treasure. Valuable. Treasure. Valuable. Valuable. So should I do these? Something can

816
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:21,059
go inside of the chest there, right? Can things go? Wait a minute. Let me just check. Care. It

817
02:41:21,059 --> 02:41:27,739
would say. Okay. You wish to make a purchase. Sell it all. It would actually say like,

818
02:41:27,739 --> 02:41:38,420
combinable. Let's just get rid of sell it all. 1,905,000. Crimson glass. Wooden angel statue.

819
02:41:39,989 --> 02:41:45,610
Necklace. Wait, wait. I should examine this stuff first? Because yeah, some of this. You can like

820
02:41:45,610 --> 02:41:52,969
touch this stuff and like look around at it. Examine. All right. This, maybe the second

821
02:41:52,969 --> 02:42:10,469
thing I can touch or open or click on. I get it. Hold on. No, nothing. I guess I don't think so.

822
02:42:10,469 --> 02:42:15,670
It's an escape room. Wait, I know, but like I'm serious. There's probably like a button on this

823
02:42:15,670 --> 02:42:24,229
shit somewhere. I'm serious. This is just Skyrim. It's not. All right. You owe us a wink. There you

824
02:42:24,229 --> 02:42:32,600
go. What about the glass? All right. Please spam yes if I'm overthinking the absolute hell out of

825
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:49,540
this. Am I just overthinking this like crazy for no reason? Sell it all. I have 19,000 bucks.

826
02:42:51,299 --> 02:43:03,379
Supplies. I can get increased item slots. Mines. I could just buy some first aid. Rock on ammo.

827
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:19,059
High capacity magazine. Hair trigger. Greatly increases fire rate. Well, more probably slots.

828
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:23,989
I'm going to do the safe thing. Ah, so you noticed that. Give me the safe thing.

829
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:34,469
I'm going to buy, I'm buying, I'm buying one of those and I'm going to buy, I'm going to buy some

830
02:43:34,469 --> 02:43:41,059
shotgun ammo. How much should I buy? It's one, it's a thousand for one shot. No, thank you.

831
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:51,430
Can I get the boom, boom, boom for the shotgun? Greatly increases fire rate. I think I'm going to

832
02:43:51,430 --> 02:44:02,979
do it. Yeah, I want it. Nice. All right. I'm out of money. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons.

833
02:44:02,979 --> 02:44:08,549
Thank you for your patronage. Well, this has just, he just yelled that at me. That was weird. Okay.

834
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:28,329
Way more space. All right. Let me rearrange. How do I rearrange? Shift, move. Okay. Let me clean up

835
02:44:28,329 --> 02:44:45,510
my inventory. It looks, it's a mess. That's better. No. Yeah. See, that's much better.

836
02:44:46,069 --> 02:44:59,190
Rock on ammo. Let's get it. It's a Tarkov inventory. Holy shit. Look at how far away this was.

837
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:13,059
This was an hour and 45 minutes ago. I would have been so sad if I didn't get it. Okay.

838
02:45:15,159 --> 02:45:18,600
So what, what are you actually supposed to go here? Let me pick up some keywords.

839
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:25,909
Labyrinth, house on a hill, water wheel, iron tower, labyrinth, unique, special crafted metal

840
02:45:25,909 --> 02:45:43,610
ball, special metal ball. Okay. I need a special metal ball. Where have I not gone?

841
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:54,680
Uh, I could, there's something, I could go this way. We'll go into Lady, uh, Lady Demetrius's

842
02:45:54,680 --> 02:46:06,329
chambers. What's this? Is that guy all right? What just happened? Wait, what? What did he do?

843
02:46:07,129 --> 02:46:17,479
By the way, that guy's definitely sitting on the toilet. I would be shocked if he wasn't.

844
02:46:17,479 --> 02:46:23,930
Okay. We need to go to Lady Demetrius's chamber. Let's just go this way. Right.

845
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:46,010
Uh, bed chamber. Q is spin. I got to remember that. Nothing here. This is not Lady Demetrius's

846
02:46:46,010 --> 02:47:10,860
chamber. Isn't this her bedroom? This is not her bedroom. I think it's upstairs. I'm just saying

847
02:47:10,860 --> 02:47:18,180
it to piss us off now. I don't, I don't, I'm sorry. I have my own head cannon. Demit, Demetrius. It

848
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:23,219
sounds much more, I don't know. What was it? I don't even know. I don't remember even what it was

849
02:47:23,219 --> 02:47:37,100
because I find it to be something I don't want to say. Domitresque. That sounds, okay. So like,

850
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:40,379
have you heard it like, oh, what would you, what would you like on your, on your taco?

851
02:47:40,379 --> 02:47:47,319
I'll take a, uh, jalapeño, please. It's jalapeno. Like, I feel like domitresque is

852
02:47:47,319 --> 02:48:03,510
Demitrisu. That's not how language works. I don't know. What do you want me to say?

853
02:48:03,510 --> 02:48:21,750
All right. I need to go DEE. You're the one saying jalapeno though. Whatever. Is the wine room? No.

854
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:33,049
Okay. Now where are we going? Where is Demitrius's chambers? Here? Walk from the other side. Sure.

855
02:48:33,690 --> 02:49:18,170
Where's this lady sleep? Oh, I have the bottle of wine. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, courtyard key. I got a new

856
02:49:18,170 --> 02:49:29,739
key. Is it right? Nice. Let me look at what it says. Key for the door from the castle's dining

857
02:49:29,739 --> 02:49:41,299
hall to the courtyard. Down to the dining hall. Get the bottles. I don't waste bullets. No.

858
02:49:41,299 --> 02:50:03,059
Don't break all this shit. God damn it. Where do I go? Where's the dining room?

859
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:09,180
Dining room is behind me. So it's behind her. So I'm going to run. I'm just going to do a juke

860
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:20,659
and run right by her. Here we go. Oh, she's fast. She's fast. She's fast. Oh, she's fast.

861
02:50:20,659 --> 02:50:47,319
Oh, she's fast. Oh, all right. That was not hard. Think fast. Think fast. I can do it. Think fast.

862
02:50:47,319 --> 02:50:59,670
Sora, think fast. Think fast. I can do it. Think fast. Nope. Think fast. So it's close. Think fast.

863
02:51:00,149 --> 02:51:21,819
Think fast. There it is. I need to do another. I don't know what that is. There's no doors.

864
02:51:26,969 --> 02:51:45,450
Open. Okay. I'm getting the shotgun out for this one. I thought I had 38 rounds. I was like, wow,

865
02:51:45,450 --> 02:52:01,290
I just beat the game wicked easily. Hey, Titans and Eren's voice. No, that gets me in trouble.

866
02:52:01,290 --> 02:52:16,420
I'm not doing it. I got to like open the window so light comes in so I can shoot the people.

867
02:52:17,139 --> 02:52:41,110
What have you done to my daughter? You know, I'm here. Oh, a map. Oh, dude. Dude. Dude. Yes.

868
02:52:47,559 --> 02:53:03,829
We're going to, I'm going to kill Lady Dimitrescu. Dude. Hello. It's me, daughter killer. I'd like to

869
02:53:03,829 --> 02:53:33,979
talk to you. I'd like to have a little bit of conversation. What are these? Why are they holes?

870
02:53:34,059 --> 02:54:03,420
It's a gamer chair. That's so stupid. What do I have to do there? What have you done to my daughter?

871
02:54:05,209 --> 02:54:16,579
My daughter. What do you do? My daughter. There's something I'm doing here.

872
02:54:21,370 --> 02:54:25,049
Women are blind to male advances, but the poor shall take their chances

873
02:54:25,049 --> 02:54:40,229
to give their lord their bounties sown so that soon the wine may flow. Like move them?

874
02:54:40,309 --> 02:54:51,829
Women are blind to male advances, but male advances turn to, or what was it? Women are blind

875
02:54:51,829 --> 02:54:59,159
to male advances, but the poor shall take their chances to give their lord the bounties sworn

876
02:54:59,159 --> 02:55:16,139
so that soon the wine may flow. Okay. So they have to, this is the lord. Who's this? Women?

877
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:28,020
Women are, women are blind to male advances. So you look this way. Yeah, I got it.

878
02:55:29,350 --> 02:55:33,030
That's the lord and that's the wine. I know. What do you think? I don't know what I'm doing.

879
02:55:35,209 --> 02:55:52,760
Oh my goodness. What a gamer. Thanks. This is, I fell asleep. Well, then you must not even have

880
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:57,239
the volume on because there's, okay, if you're sleeping on this stream, the stream is muted.

881
02:55:57,239 --> 02:56:01,399
There's been screams and shit. Shotgun blasts in your ears. Like there's no way you're watching

882
02:56:01,399 --> 02:56:11,079
the stream muted. You know, the times I've screamed in the last hour, like as loud as my body can

883
02:56:11,079 --> 02:56:28,149
probably do it. What the hell? Damn it. Okay. This is going to be scary. I know it. This is

884
02:56:28,149 --> 02:56:40,180
going to be scary. There's going to be scary monster. Yes, there is. Can I, can I jump over

885
02:56:40,180 --> 02:57:02,840
this? Nope. I just have to kill this guy. Where'd he go? He's in the water. Oh my God. Is that him?

886
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:27,819
No. Women are blind to male advances, but male advances take their chances for the lord they

887
02:57:27,819 --> 02:57:37,639
seek to swore their keep. The wine will flow. Balls deep. I don't know. Whatever it was.

888
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:58,870
I think there's another one right here. That low recoil is awesome. That's really useful.

889
02:57:59,430 --> 02:58:16,500
Oh, I got to reply. This is important. Remember that sounded like iPhone predict text. Sometimes

890
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:22,260
I feel like I actually am doing iPhone predict text. Sometimes my brain goes too fast and has

891
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:26,819
to just say words that just sound like they might fit there. It actually happens all the time.

892
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:46,459
Yeah. You're too close. You're too close. You were just way too close. I'm sorry. Way too close.

893
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:55,049
Well, what the hell was that for? That didn't do anything for me. There's a screwed everything

894
02:58:55,049 --> 02:59:03,690
up. Now open this. I'm going to have to close this on somebody. Somebody's going to be coming

895
02:59:03,690 --> 02:59:18,659
down this way and I'm going to close it on him. Like right now, like right now close it. Where'd

896
02:59:18,659 --> 03:00:06,579
they go? Three shots. Okay. Worked out. Hypers drink the bong water, bong water. I can't see

897
03:00:06,579 --> 03:00:22,950
anything. I'm going to make some handgun ammo. This game is actually pretty scary. It's really

898
03:00:22,950 --> 03:01:08,600
scary. Run, run. All right. I got to make handgun ammo. Aaron, are you? Oh, that was not a smart

899
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:19,100
play. Very, very unintelligent play there. I'm making a lot of money. This is good. Okay. Hold

900
03:01:19,100 --> 03:01:28,020
on. I need ammo. I have three med kits. I'm doing fine. Okay. Should I just make a shitload of

901
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:36,180
shotgun bullets or what? What do you think? Just make six shotgun shells and just have just a

902
03:01:36,180 --> 03:01:42,969
massive amount of bullets. What should I make? Be safe. No, whatever. I'm going to make these.

903
03:01:43,770 --> 03:02:05,639
Still something in here that I'm missing. I got a P too. I'm going to go. I got to do my first P

904
03:02:05,639 --> 03:02:29,590
and then I'm going to refill my fake Fiji water. Why are you here? I get a lot of items.

905
03:02:33,290 --> 03:02:46,469
I hear something. Oh wait, what is this? All right. I got everything. Look at this face. I just

906
03:02:46,790 --> 03:03:20,649
came all over my mouth. As you're over there. All right. Demetrius's. I know whatever. I don't care.

907
03:03:20,649 --> 03:03:27,989
Thousand bucks. Holy shit. I don't want to go in here yet. I want to go back outside here because

908
03:03:27,989 --> 03:03:36,500
it's stuff. There's phones in residency. I didn't even think there'd be like a telephone in this

909
03:03:36,500 --> 03:04:05,659
game. It's 2020. Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry. I regret to inform you that Ethan Winters has

910
03:04:06,139 --> 03:04:13,559
escaped that fool Heisenberg because he is in my castle and has already proven too

911
03:04:13,559 --> 03:04:23,690
much for my daughters to handle when I find him. No, Miranda. Yes, of course. I understand the

912
03:04:23,690 --> 03:04:33,350
importance of the ceremony. I won't let you down. Why does she have a reflection? Holy shit. To

913
03:04:33,350 --> 03:04:46,790
hell with the ceremony. That man will pay for what he's done. What is going on in this game?

914
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:52,360
I have no idea what the story is. I'm the guy from the last game. In the last game, there was

915
03:04:52,360 --> 03:04:55,799
that old, like spoilers if you haven't played Resident Evil 7, but what the hell are you watching

916
03:04:55,799 --> 03:05:01,239
Resident Evil 8 for in the first place? There was the old lady in the chair was like the antagonist

917
03:05:02,469 --> 03:05:12,360
and it was like this experiment, right? It was a boat. You had like this, your girlfriend was like

918
03:05:12,360 --> 03:05:18,459
the runner of a project that like had to do with this little girl and the little girl like aged

919
03:05:18,459 --> 03:05:27,180
rapidly into an old lady and like she was controlling everybody. Everyone was like under

920
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:38,420
her control. She was making them do like crazy things. She was the little girl's caretaker.

921
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:44,979
Yeah, right, right. But then we like escaped the island. Chris Redfield's like, nice job, nice job

922
03:05:44,979 --> 03:05:54,780
partner. And now Chris Redfield wants to take my baby and like killed Mia and now we're in this

923
03:05:54,780 --> 03:06:00,840
weird like fucking cartoon Avengers house. I guess we're going to figure it out with like this vampire

924
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:11,770
lady, this like little like corpse bride person, Igor, and fucking like cool like Mortal Kombat

925
03:06:11,770 --> 03:06:30,120
Elvis. We're just going to find out. We were all called by Mother Miranda to decide the fate of

926
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:35,719
the child's father, me. Just thinking of that family meeting makes me shudder. I think I'm

927
03:06:35,719 --> 03:06:41,159
treated like a sister to those miscreants, especially Heisenberg. That riff raff wouldn't

928
03:06:41,159 --> 03:06:44,760
know proper manners if they slapped him in the face. I would have sliced him into ribbons if

929
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:49,770
Mother hadn't. OK, so Mother, why does she treat me the same as them? She gave me the

930
03:06:49,770 --> 03:06:53,930
castle, obedient daughters, everlasting life. Did she not? Am I not her favorite? Am I not special?

931
03:06:54,729 --> 03:07:21,219
I didn't even realize just how tall this how tall she is. That's fucking huge. Wow. Where are you?

932
03:07:21,219 --> 03:07:26,500
Just realized. I mean, I mean, every time I've seen her, I've been like crouching looking up or like

933
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:30,819
in chains looking up at her. I've never like actually stood up face to face. She like picked

934
03:07:30,819 --> 03:07:45,739
me up and put me on like hooks. What am I supposed to do here? Look for Rose in the castle.

935
03:07:49,290 --> 03:07:58,500
I moved this? How is all this shit locked? Does it open the door from the other side?

936
03:07:59,219 --> 03:08:30,170
Yeah, where am I supposed to go? I'm stuck in her bedroom. OK, the Mitrasue key. It's the one.

937
03:08:30,170 --> 03:08:33,770
That's what these keys. OK, these doors. There's a couple of them I need to go to.

938
03:08:49,930 --> 03:08:58,649
Lay your filthy manhands on my daughters. And now you even try to steal my property.

939
03:09:13,850 --> 03:09:16,889
Go ahead, do your worst.

940
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:23,459
She's like falling, screaming like she fell in the same hole or something.

941
03:09:24,340 --> 03:09:31,299
She lands right on her neck and fucking you hear just crunches her legs. Her knees hit the fucking

942
03:09:31,299 --> 03:09:39,909
ground behind her and her neck just snaps off. If I fall through this, she falls through there too.

943
03:09:40,469 --> 03:09:48,120
She's has she's got like at least fucking 300 pounds on me. How was the floor holding her?

944
03:09:48,120 --> 03:10:08,889
If I fall through the floor, she put in so much force. I don't buy it. That's rude. She's like

945
03:10:08,889 --> 03:10:17,510
12 feet tall. I'm just saying she's big. She's very large. She's like 12 and a half feet tall.

946
03:10:18,549 --> 03:10:25,719
Nine feet tall. Sorry. It's OK. I got it wrong. She's like 10 feet tall. If you were 10 feet tall,

947
03:10:25,719 --> 03:10:36,569
you would probably weigh like 300 fucking pounds. All right, let's go.

948
03:10:36,569 --> 03:10:43,479
No, I wouldn't. Yes, you would. You'd that you'd just be a large person.

949
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:51,829
I'm going to look. All right. How much does Shaq weigh? How tall is Shaq?

950
03:10:52,389 --> 03:11:06,809
Shaq's like seven five, right? Like eight feet tall. How much does Shaq weigh? Shaq is seven two.

951
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:18,090
So so Lady Demetrius is like three feet taller than Shaq. I'm going to guess that she's

952
03:11:18,090 --> 03:11:35,270
probably 300 pounds. She's going to chase me around, right? This is a this is a boss room.

953
03:11:35,270 --> 03:11:43,700
This is like a weird boss room. Shaq is three hundred and twenty four pounds. OK.

954
03:11:44,420 --> 03:11:47,610
All right. Oh, God, what is going on? This is a boss room. I got to pay attention.

955
03:11:55,299 --> 03:12:06,860
I could let you get away with a slice of your ribbons before you ever see me chuckle.

956
03:12:06,860 --> 03:12:08,700
Boss fight. No.

957
03:12:12,250 --> 03:12:29,510
Hey, where'd she go? Whoa. Whoa. My hand. Pull it. Cut the other hand off.

958
03:12:30,309 --> 03:12:43,879
Whoa. She's probably right here. Whoa. Oh, a box. I can't. I can't do my hand.

959
03:12:47,670 --> 03:13:14,040
Duck. Move out of the way. You actually thought I was going to let you get away, darling.

960
03:13:15,659 --> 03:13:19,659
OK. Yep. This time, don't freak out. Just press it again.

961
03:13:21,559 --> 03:13:41,379
Ow. Here it is.

962
03:13:41,379 --> 03:13:55,159
I mean, no. What the fuck am I doing?

963
03:14:11,049 --> 03:14:25,100
Any items, any stuff, stuff, any items? Nope. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Open the door. Key.

964
03:14:26,739 --> 03:14:38,120
Open it. Oh, geez. OK, I got the mask of sorrow. Oh, geez.

965
03:14:39,079 --> 03:14:51,850
I guess I'll try. What?

966
03:14:58,260 --> 03:15:07,620
Is this guy like a Roblox character? Like, what is he made of the Legos? Did it work?

967
03:15:12,860 --> 03:15:25,450
Screw this castle. Did I use my guns? What the fuck is making that sound?

968
03:15:27,299 --> 03:15:39,530
Escape the castle. I have, hold on. I have the Demetrius key, right? Isn't there another Demetrius

969
03:15:39,530 --> 03:15:58,729
Udor right there? No. I swear to God, this is another Demetrius Udor literally right behind me.

970
03:15:59,290 --> 03:16:25,979
All right. Where's the big, where's that fat guy? I need him. Everybody's spoiling. Spoiling what?

971
03:16:25,979 --> 03:16:28,940
I'm not even looking at chat. If you're sending me that they will look out for spoilers,

972
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:32,219
spoiler alert. I'm not looking at the fucking chat for like at least 20 minutes.

973
03:16:32,860 --> 03:16:51,430
Oh, nice castle map. Opera Hall. Can I go in? I can't go in the Opera Hall. I'm not looking.

974
03:16:51,430 --> 03:17:07,110
I don't want to see. Let me actually, I need to do some crafting here. Yeah, give me another one.

975
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:13,290
How's my health? Am I okay? Please be aware, the mistress's lipstick is missing. If anyone

976
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:17,129
finds it, could they please return it to her bathroom? It is custom made and therefore very

977
03:17:17,129 --> 03:18:09,219
expensive. I mean that, what's this? What's that Metroid thing? Three girls have stopped moving.

978
03:18:09,219 --> 03:18:14,979
They see Momo's dead. An insect flew out of the eldest's mouth. It appears to be a common fly.

979
03:18:15,700 --> 03:18:20,440
Three days since treatment, all three bodies are covered in flies. It appears the flies

980
03:18:20,440 --> 03:26:37,000
are consuming their flesh. When I opened, I got a pee. I'll be right back. I'm back. I'm back.

981
03:26:37,559 --> 03:26:43,659
I dropped a coffee on the ground. I dropped it on the ground and it was, it was a disaster.

982
03:26:44,219 --> 03:26:54,139
Toilet. Yeah, the toilet got clogged. I had to plunge the toilet. It was, it was a joke.

983
03:26:54,139 --> 03:27:03,299
You're lucky I wasn't gone for 40 minutes, but I'm ready to get back into it. Let's go.

984
03:27:08,219 --> 03:27:17,959
Oh, I got a question for all you PC enthusiasts here. So, so I have a 3090 and this thing is loud

985
03:27:18,680 --> 03:27:30,260
and runs hot. How hard is it to like put a new heat, like a heat sink on this? Like should I

986
03:27:30,260 --> 03:27:38,280
get like a water cooling system for the GPU? Because this thing is going like it sounds like

987
03:27:38,280 --> 03:27:55,379
a jet engine in here. Clean the fans. I mean, this is a, this is literally brand new. What 3090 is it?

988
03:27:56,420 --> 03:28:03,620
Um, I don't know if honestly it was, all these graphics supplies are in such a low supply

989
03:28:03,620 --> 03:28:09,209
that it just, whatever one was available, I bought it. I don't even know what the brand is. Let me

990
03:28:09,209 --> 03:28:38,899
see who the brand is. Zotac? Is Zotac gaming? Zotac? I don't know. What's Zotac? I knew it.

991
03:28:39,639 --> 03:28:48,950
Those are the only ones that are available. What do you want me to do? Zotac is one of the brands.

992
03:28:48,950 --> 03:28:53,110
Yeah. Zotac is fine. Yeah. People are saying Zotac is good. Zotac is fine. Yeah. Zotac is

993
03:28:53,110 --> 03:28:58,649
fucking fine. What's wrong with Zotac? I haven't had any problems with it. The only problem I have

994
03:28:58,649 --> 03:29:03,209
is that I think it's a little loud. Like the fans. I just get to take the heat sink off,

995
03:29:03,209 --> 03:29:07,750
put a new one on. I mean, if you're going to have a 3090, 3090 is literally like,

996
03:29:07,750 --> 03:29:13,030
like a down payment on a house. Like it's like I'm buying a car. So like I may as well like

997
03:29:13,590 --> 03:29:30,149
pony up to put like a liquid cooling system on it, right? I'm going back. 3090 is run,

998
03:29:30,149 --> 03:29:47,979
just, just run hot. I got another fake Fiji. Why do you stream in 720p? Because I have only had

999
03:29:47,979 --> 03:29:57,020
a 3090 in the computer like three hours. Sorry. It's been like a little bit longer, but whatever.

1000
03:29:57,020 --> 03:30:03,479
It's been like a little while, whatever. All right. All three bodies have almost completely

1001
03:30:03,479 --> 03:30:08,520
consumed by the insects. Insects eat people. It's just afternoon and the insects just started eating.

1002
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:14,600
Those around the face turned pale and the lips turned red. The massive insects have transformed

1003
03:30:14,600 --> 03:30:19,399
into human bodies again. All three girls are woke looking at me like newborns. I sense a bond

1004
03:30:19,399 --> 03:30:29,079
between us like mother and daughters. I've already decided their names. Flies are turning into people.

1005
03:30:29,879 --> 03:30:45,940
Okay. Interesting. Every Zotac fan, uh, card I've bought had the fans die. Um, I mean,

1006
03:30:45,940 --> 03:30:50,649
that's kind of anecdotal evidence I think, but I mean, still they are pretty, they're,

1007
03:30:50,649 --> 03:30:53,690
they are turning right now, but it's just so hot in here. I gotta like get,

1008
03:30:53,690 --> 03:30:58,010
I gotta figure out a solution. All right. Escape the castle. Let's just go whatever I was doing

1009
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:34,760
and go, bingo. Running out of bullets. This is bad. Need bullets. There's a big piano. Oh,

1010
03:31:34,760 --> 03:32:18,010
wait, this is a piano. Can I play the piano? Yes. Okay. You didn't even look at the stage.

1011
03:32:18,010 --> 03:32:37,100
What do you mean? What stage? Oh, we've got the iron key. Oh, all right. It's an opera.

1012
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:41,020
The fan curve using Zotac software. You're running at a 10, you were running at 1080p.

1013
03:32:41,020 --> 03:32:45,340
You can make it quiet for a thermal ceiling of 78 degrees Celsius. That's good to know. Thank you.

1014
03:32:46,649 --> 03:32:56,870
Probably use that. All right. So the iron key, there are a few iron doors.

1015
03:32:57,670 --> 03:33:03,799
It's still in here though. All right. Looking for iron doors. Where's an iron door?

1016
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:14,600
There are no iron doors here. There's an iron door down in like that like weird chamber place,

1017
03:33:15,319 --> 03:33:24,500
which is this way. All right. We'll go in there. Just spit on it. It would go,

1018
03:33:25,459 --> 03:33:30,819
that wouldn't do anything. That'd be banned that fucking person. Seriously. What are you talking

1019
03:33:30,819 --> 03:33:56,120
about? Odd. Okay. I need to go this way, right? Cause then I need to go down here, right? That's

1020
03:33:56,120 --> 03:34:36,760
an iron key, isn't it? Oh my God. It's Lady Dimitra. Who the fuck am I into the courtyard? Let's go.

1021
03:34:37,479 --> 03:35:00,780
Does she come down here? They really do have swords and shit. They really are dark souls enemies.

1022
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:09,059
She come out here. Oh my God. She actually comes out here. All right. I need iron door,

1023
03:35:09,059 --> 03:35:14,840
which is I got to go right down through the kitchen, which is going to bring me

1024
03:35:15,719 --> 03:35:38,709
through here. I hope so. I don't know. Wait, she's I can burn her. Just run. Fucking down here.

1025
03:35:39,430 --> 03:35:51,500
Making a mistake. Am I making a mistake? I don't think this is a mistake. I think this is a good

1026
03:35:51,500 --> 03:35:59,110
idea. This is a good idea. I mean, if you're going to shoot that many times, just get the money and

1027
03:35:59,110 --> 03:36:16,620
go. I'm sorry. Open the door. Oh my God. What happened? Can they open doors? She's not going

1028
03:36:16,620 --> 03:36:24,979
to actually, she's not going to come in this room, right? Is she going to come in this door?

1029
03:36:25,620 --> 03:36:29,139
She's not going to, that's her. She's coming. I have to figure out what this is. What am I doing?

1030
03:36:29,860 --> 03:36:36,040
I have to burn this? Is she going to come down here? She can't even fit through the door. I'm

1031
03:36:36,040 --> 03:36:54,409
fine. Oh my God. Where are you? I got to break this. Come on. Come on. Break the door. Break this.

1032
03:36:55,049 --> 03:36:58,729
How do I get in here? I need to light this. I need to light them. How do I light them?

1033
03:36:59,370 --> 03:37:21,260
All right. I need to light this shit. How do I light these? Can I blow this door? Can I blow

1034
03:37:21,260 --> 03:37:39,700
this up? I'm going to blow it up. I didn't miss. I got to push these back and forth together.

1035
03:37:39,780 --> 03:39:26,219
Come on and get it. Fight this. Fight it. As your eye. As your eye. Money. Ooh,

1036
03:39:26,219 --> 03:39:40,409
crystal fragment. Okay. I cleaned it out. Now. Hey, where do I go now? That was down here.

1037
03:39:44,489 --> 03:40:07,459
Second floor is up here. There's a Demetrius. There's a Demetrius key over here. I got to go

1038
03:40:07,459 --> 03:40:15,319
to the hall of pleasure, but first let's, I got to grab some stuff because I am almost out of ammo.

1039
03:40:17,739 --> 03:40:22,780
Very important handguns. Good. All right. We're going to go to the hall of pleasure. So if I

1040
03:40:22,780 --> 03:40:26,540
bang a left here and run straight, that'll take me down and go through the kitchen

1041
03:40:27,879 --> 03:40:34,069
into the merchant's room. Let me stop there. And then I go to the second floor.

1042
03:40:34,069 --> 03:40:37,639
Okay. Let me go. I'm good. Let me, I got to get to the merchant room down here

1043
03:40:38,360 --> 03:40:59,700
into the main hall through the kitchen. Let's go. Shit. Pleasure room. It's kind of a creepy

1044
03:40:59,700 --> 03:41:09,500
thing to name a room. Here we go. She's going to show up here and I'm going to have to dodge

1045
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:16,440
around her. All right. We're going to straight through there, bang a right in the dining room.

1046
03:41:16,440 --> 03:41:28,040
Okay. Here we go. Oh my God. I escaped myself a headache. I have a headache.

1047
03:41:28,840 --> 03:41:33,159
Oh my God. I escaped myself. I have a headache now. I just popped a blood vessel in my brain.

1048
03:41:38,180 --> 03:41:53,129
Wrong way. Shit. She saw me. Wrong way. Are you okay? Oh, I think so. I feel like I'm all right.

1049
03:41:53,129 --> 03:42:05,940
Okay. We got to go to the merchant's room. He is no wrong way. Turn around. Straight ahead.

1050
03:42:06,899 --> 03:42:14,229
All right. I finally feel safe. It's a pleasure to see you safe.

1051
03:42:14,229 --> 03:42:17,750
How were things? Coffee anybody? No sign of Rose.

1052
03:42:19,959 --> 03:42:26,680
Sorry. It turned out that way. You'll find your way to her once you're out of this castle.

1053
03:42:26,680 --> 03:42:35,559
Do you have need of anything for the road ahead? Yes. Welcome. Welcome. You're sure to find something

1054
03:42:35,559 --> 03:42:46,809
new. Okay. Oh, did I get any items I can put here? Ask of sorrow, the key, the iron key.

1055
03:42:48,409 --> 03:42:58,250
Eyes are like so watery. You wish to make a purchase. Valuable. Valuable. Okay. Combineable.

1056
03:42:59,049 --> 03:43:09,030
Crystal fragment. Crystal skull. Azure eye. Can the Azure eye go in the skull?

1057
03:43:09,750 --> 03:43:27,639
Or does everything? No. I'm buying this because of our relationship. Oh my God. I have three of

1058
03:43:27,639 --> 03:43:39,129
these. Holy shit. Okay. I'm going to hold on to that. All right. I got almost 17,000. New stock.

1059
03:43:41,430 --> 03:43:57,850
You got. Did you though? Okay. Power. I really do. I'm a shotgun user. I am.

1060
03:43:59,530 --> 03:44:09,930
Sell the shotgun. You schmuck. Ammo capacity or don't do upgrades. Am I going to get like

1061
03:44:09,930 --> 03:44:15,139
five more guns? I get it. All right. Just something an old friend of mine used to say.

1062
03:44:15,700 --> 03:44:35,719
Oh, there it is. I don't think I want anything. You know what? I'm going to. Yes, I do. I want this.

04:21:36,659 --> 04:21:39,459

1218
04:21:44,260 --> 04:21:57,340
Right delighted to it may be

1219
04:21:58,459 --> 04:22:05,260
Our that's just 140. That's not that much

1220
04:22:07,059 --> 04:22:13,139
Reload speed. No, that's not that much either. Yeah, let's depart. These hands are more dexterous than one might think

1221

I have 18 000. Why can I not?

1222
04:22:24,049 --> 04:22:25,329
Oh, what the hell?

1223
04:22:25,329 --> 04:22:27,889
Uh ammo capacity. I want more ammo in the shotgun

1224
04:22:28,610 --> 04:22:35,540
And let's just just just upgrade the whole thing. Just just let's go. I use it so often

Um, that's fine

1227
04:22:39,790 --> 04:22:43,629
This is fine. Okay, that's all right

1228
04:22:43,690 --> 04:22:46,350
Securing goods is more important than anything

1229
04:22:46,989 --> 04:22:49,870

Sell the ring. Yeah, that's something

1236
04:23:23,010 --> 04:23:25,010
Never buy something you can craft

1237
04:23:25,250 --> 04:23:30,430
Hey, where are you in this game?

1238
04:23:30,590 --> 04:23:32,340

04:23:32,340 --> 04:23:34,420
Upgrade the sniper rifle. Wait, should I not sell this?

1240
04:23:36,209 --> 04:23:38,209
How would I not sell it come again?

1241
04:23:41,739 --> 04:23:48,079
Can I use it somewhere?

1242
04:23:48,079 --> 04:23:50,879
As you wish you can you need it later?

1243
04:23:52,739 --> 04:23:57,219

Shotgun is good. We're gonna do pow. No

1250
04:24:21,469 --> 04:24:23,469
Ammo capacity on the sniper rifle

1251

You're the one who's cursed that was my favorite character and now she's not even in the game anymore

1296
04:33:33,180 --> 04:33:46,799
She was I was just like the weird guy with the hammer and the old lady

04:33:52,020 --> 04:34:03,860
Fuck all viewers are gonna leave now

1298
04:34:04,419 --> 04:34:08,369

Dirty flask. Okay

1300
04:34:10,369 --> 04:34:15,459
I feel like I should look around for a second. That was really intense. I mean that wasn't like

1301
04:34:16,020 --> 04:34:17,540
Super hard

1302
04:34:17,540 --> 04:34:29,900
It was cool. I imagine that on hardcore is probably really hard. They actually left because she's not in the game anymore

1303
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:39,580
Still looking for rose

1304
04:34:43,650 --> 04:34:45,650
We're still looking for rose

1305
04:34:45,729 --> 04:34:46,770

1310
04:35:22,720 --> 04:35:25,279
I thought it was 41. I'm stupid. Never mind

1311
04:35:28,020 --> 04:35:36,180
Let's go. Is it you actually your birthday? It is not my birthday. Don't listen to anybody

1312
04:35:38,180 --> 04:35:45,939
They're lying to you

1313
04:35:45,939 --> 04:35:50,479
All right. Well, that's where I need to go next

1314
04:35:50,479 --> 04:35:52,479
But I do want to see there's anything else here

1315
04:35:56,459 --> 04:36:01,599
bridge

1316
04:36:01,599 --> 04:36:03,599

1318
04:36:22,259 --> 04:36:27,169

1319
04:36:27,169 --> 04:36:29,389
fish

1320
04:36:29,389 --> 04:36:38,099
Can I eat this?

1321
04:36:38,099 --> 04:36:49,310
Boys together as one within the endless dark deliver us in two fates hands

1322
04:36:50,770 --> 04:36:57,650
As the midnight moon as the midnight moon rises on oh, she had to restart her line. We await the light at the end

1323
04:36:58,610 --> 04:37:00,610
In life and in death

1324
04:37:01,090 --> 04:37:04,529
Grab the hood pull it back look right in her eyes. Remember me remember me

1325
04:37:05,220 --> 04:37:14,669
I almost tell me what is going on around here. Can a man be almost whatever it?

1326
04:37:15,630 --> 04:37:17,630
That's a question for the wise

1327
04:37:18,270 --> 04:37:23,709
See he did it though. You know what I mean, and I still haven't found rose. Where did mother miranda take her?

1328
04:37:25,470 --> 04:37:27,540
You're too late

1329
04:37:27,540 --> 04:37:29,060
or maybe

1330
04:37:29,060 --> 04:37:31,060
Almost too late

1331
04:37:31,540 --> 04:37:38,180
The child will be sacrificed life for life. What kind of sick medieval shit is this? She's just a baby

1332
04:37:38,979 --> 04:37:42,139
Crest is not just a baby

1333
04:37:45,299 --> 04:37:48,819
Will you please stop talking in riddles? I just want to find my daughter

1334
04:37:52,380 --> 04:37:54,799
Riddle if you don't know the answer

1335
04:38:02,319 --> 04:38:05,599
That looks familiar, why am I letting her just leave hey, hey wait

1336
04:38:09,250 --> 04:38:13,569
Why not just swing just roundhouse roundhouse kick this lady in the face?

1337
04:38:14,529 --> 04:38:16,770
and when she's like

1338
04:38:16,770 --> 04:38:28,639
On the ground be like where's the fucking baby? Tell me winged key

1339
04:38:29,279 --> 04:38:33,380
This is an evil witch

1340
04:38:33,380 --> 04:38:35,790
Like warlock lady

1341
04:38:35,790 --> 04:38:38,830
She's like killing people. She literally is killing me

1342
04:38:39,069 --> 04:38:43,389
She tried to kill me that time in the very beginning. Maybe she was like scrape scrape scrape slash

1343
04:38:43,470 --> 04:38:46,270
And she like slashed and killed like somebody is the same person

1344
04:38:46,830 --> 04:38:54,349
That's the same person that like killed like a bunch of what there was a that was a bad person. There's a bad person

1345
04:38:54,909 --> 04:38:56,900
That's not the same person

1346
04:38:56,900 --> 04:39:03,139
Didn't she like slash somebody with like a fucking magic wand?

1347
04:39:12,700 --> 04:39:29,630
Whatever it's a different person. It has human skulls on her step

1348
04:39:30,029 --> 04:39:34,590
I swear to god in the very beginning of the game. She like was walking and tap tap and then she like tried she like slashed us

1349
04:39:47,439 --> 04:39:51,599
Oh, this looks great

1350
04:39:51,680 --> 04:39:55,409
And this isn't even an rtx on because i'm afraid to overheat my computer

1351
04:39:55,970 --> 04:40:05,060
This pattern looks so yeah, this is umbrella

1352
04:40:05,380 --> 04:40:12,639
Wait, is this like implying that umbrella has like existed for like 500 years or something?

1353
04:40:13,659 --> 04:40:15,659
What year is it supposed to be?

1354
04:40:15,819 --> 04:40:17,259
What year is this?

1355
04:40:17,259 --> 04:40:25,259
What year is it? It's supposed to be 2021

1356
04:40:26,990 --> 04:40:30,029
Oh, um, do I have anything I can put here?

1357
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:50,700
I don't think so

1358
04:40:50,700 --> 04:40:52,720
Resident evil 7 takes place in 2017

1359
04:41:02,419 --> 04:41:17,500
Oh, it doesn't

1360
04:41:17,500 --> 04:41:32,909
Oh my god. All right. I need some more healing. I accidentally wasted a whole healing potion for no reason

1361
04:41:33,630 --> 04:41:35,939
It was really dumb

1362
04:41:35,939 --> 04:41:46,000
Where'd he go? Oh, I need to make some heals

1363
04:41:47,419 --> 04:41:48,220
Oh

1364
04:41:48,220 --> 04:41:59,020
Magic goat. I still don't have whatever this thing is

1365
04:41:59,659 --> 04:42:02,740
That's been there from the very beginning of the whole game

1366
04:42:12,189 --> 04:42:14,750
Bill oh my god bill

1367
04:42:14,750 --> 04:42:16,750
Wait, I thought it was gonna be like, oh, who's that?

1368
04:42:17,310 --> 04:42:35,869
Never mind just a guy easy

1369
04:42:45,040 --> 04:42:49,759
Something. All right, that's where the little turn tourniquet thing is

1370
04:42:59,819 --> 04:43:01,819
Um, I kind of don't want to leave yet

1371
04:43:03,709 --> 04:43:05,549
There's more money to be made

1372
04:43:05,549 --> 04:43:07,549
Yes, that's why I didn't want to leave. I told you

1373
04:43:11,470 --> 04:43:21,630
What what is this?

1374
04:43:21,630 --> 04:43:42,459
What how do I not have that? It's annoying. This is tomato town. Somebody said this is tomato town

1375
04:43:47,900 --> 04:43:53,630
There you are. I had a feeling you would pop up. It was all worthless

1376
04:43:54,509 --> 04:43:58,270
Is that so I assume you've picked up something of value

1377
04:43:59,549 --> 04:44:01,549
Not sure if it's a value, but

1378
04:44:03,229 --> 04:44:05,229
Ah

1379
04:44:07,970 --> 04:44:11,490
What are you saying

1380
04:44:17,869 --> 04:44:30,270
Was a liquefier rosemary's head

1381
04:44:33,540 --> 04:44:37,220
Her head's in there that flask seems to contain her head

1382
04:44:44,770 --> 04:44:50,319
Don't say another word

1383
04:44:50,319 --> 04:44:51,360
this

1384
04:44:51,360 --> 04:44:57,200
This is impossible. He dropped it. This just can't be your daughter's essence is still intact

1385
04:44:58,020 --> 04:45:00,259
Her powers are truly unique

1386
04:45:04,319 --> 04:45:07,599
Who could even do this? She can be saved, you know

1387
04:45:08,319 --> 04:45:09,599
saved

1388
04:45:09,599 --> 04:45:15,279
From this are you insane? There's a house with a red chimney on the western side of the village

1389
04:45:16,000 --> 04:45:20,740
Go and seek out the man who lives there and we can continue our conversation

1390
04:45:21,939 --> 04:45:27,220
Quit holding out and get to the damn point. He lives there. You don't have to trust my words

1391
04:45:27,939 --> 04:45:30,630
But do you have any better options?

1392
04:45:36,500 --> 04:45:38,020
your choice

1393
04:45:38,020 --> 04:45:41,029
The customer is always right

1394
04:45:42,229 --> 04:45:43,430
after all

1395
04:45:43,430 --> 04:45:49,189
I'll give you 20 bucks if you drink pickle juice. Hey, if I find out this is a lie

1396
04:45:50,520 --> 04:45:52,880
Titans

04:46:33,810 --> 04:46:40,130
Beautiful even in death that waistline. Yes. Yeah, he put something on that. He put a little twist at the end

1400
04:46:52,599 --> 04:46:54,919
I think it's just kind of tomato tomato at this point

1401
04:47:00,099 --> 04:47:04,840
There's another tier of upgrades

1402
04:47:04,919 --> 04:47:10,680
I'll take it. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait

1403
04:47:11,479 --> 04:47:14,840
30 000 for extra baggage pipe bomb recipe

1404
04:47:16,360 --> 04:47:18,360
pipe bombs mines

1405
04:47:18,520 --> 04:47:21,880
Rifle customizable part for sniper reduces weapons sway while aiming

1406
04:47:22,680 --> 04:47:31,279
I mean should I even do this?

1407
04:47:31,279 --> 04:47:42,599
I saw you eyeing that handgun ammo. You need handgun ammo. I have a lot. How much do I have?

1408
04:47:43,319 --> 04:47:48,680
I see anything else. There's just a waste of money

1409
04:47:56,310 --> 04:48:03,590
One moment, please. I have a handgun veteran

1410
04:48:04,549 --> 04:48:11,909
You have a typewriter? Yeah, you do

1411
04:48:11,990 --> 04:48:13,270
Hold the fish

1412
04:48:13,270 --> 04:48:18,840
That's the plan. All right, go to that house over there up on that hill over there

1413
04:48:21,439 --> 04:48:28,229
Where where does he find the house with the red chimney? So we gotta go this way and find a house with a red chimney

1414
04:48:40,310 --> 04:48:46,520
Anything else I miss anything?

1415
04:48:46,520 --> 04:48:47,319

1416
04:48:47,319 --> 04:48:49,319
Decorated crest with four wings

Oh, I want you know, I want to look at the baby thing

1418
04:49:09,900 --> 04:49:19,619

I think the only door I can go in is the one that i'm currently going to yeah. Okay

1420
04:49:23,779 --> 04:49:25,779
Let's go find the red chimney

1421
04:49:28,790 --> 04:49:30,950
I almost was like, oh I found it. That's a red door

1422
04:49:31,750 --> 04:49:40,450
We load everything just in case I get

1423
04:49:40,930 --> 04:49:43,299

1424
04:49:43,299 --> 04:49:45,299
You know, I do appreciate this game. Ooh

Let me go around and just start opening shit. Let's go this way

1427
04:49:55,200 --> 04:50:00,580
I like that. They kind of went back to like the village era stuff. I like that. I think it's cool

1428
04:50:01,380 --> 04:50:02,900
Do I have any lockpicks?

1429
04:50:02,900 --> 04:50:04,840
I don't think so

1430
04:50:04,840 --> 04:50:06,200
I do actually

1431
04:50:06,200 --> 04:50:10,099
Reminds me of resident evil 4. It's like a first person resident evil 4

1432
04:50:10,740 --> 04:50:25,400
Which is pretty cool. I like it said the game name. I did say the game name. You're right. That's seven bullets. Holy shit

1433
04:50:25,479 --> 04:50:26,919
Okay, that's good

1434
04:50:26,919 --> 04:50:32,389
Anything else in here? No play postal two

1435
04:50:33,029 --> 04:50:37,919
Postal two not portal to one. I think you were talking to somebody in chat and I just answered

1436
04:50:38,560 --> 04:50:41,189
All right. Wait, there's something else in there

1437
04:50:41,509 --> 04:50:44,319
What else could possibly be in here?

1438
04:50:44,319 --> 04:50:56,880
Fabled monster wolves of old may they come eat our flesh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1439
04:50:57,599 --> 04:51:07,759
They're a diamond here

1440
04:51:07,840 --> 04:51:13,330
missing

1441
04:51:35,639 --> 04:51:38,279
Oh, it's 500. All under the bed. Okay, I got it

1442
04:51:38,919 --> 04:51:42,979
Clear. All right. We're gonna take a right

1443
04:51:42,979 --> 04:51:45,459
There's the house of the red guy. All right, I found it. There it is

1444
04:51:46,180 --> 04:51:55,759
This isn't open

1445
04:51:55,759 --> 04:52:03,639
Okay. Well, here's the house

1446
04:52:03,639 --> 04:52:06,119
Walk from the other side. Okay. Well now what?

1447
04:52:06,599 --> 04:52:18,119
What the fuck to go all the way around? That was a pretty chimney was pretty. Yeah

1448
04:52:18,919 --> 04:52:21,779
Okay, settle down

1449
04:52:21,779 --> 04:52:31,060
No pain. Nope. Everything's locked from the other side

1450
04:52:38,360 --> 04:52:44,209
What is that?

1451
04:52:44,209 --> 04:52:45,490
I climb this

1452
04:52:45,490 --> 04:52:55,639
How do I go?

1453
04:52:55,639 --> 04:53:00,229
Through here

1454
04:53:00,229 --> 04:53:02,229
Let's go. He's on the grind

1455
04:53:02,790 --> 04:53:20,740
I can't go that way

1456
04:53:20,740 --> 04:53:22,340
There's stuff in here

1457
04:53:22,340 --> 04:53:26,340
I heard a scream from the house with the chimney. I was going to take a look but the way was blocked by debris

1458
04:53:26,979 --> 04:53:28,979
Going to have to take the long way around

1459
04:53:29,139 --> 04:53:32,470
Who would have thought the hole in the stable walls would come in handy?

1460
04:53:33,029 --> 04:53:41,909
If i'm not back by morning, you should go to louise's house

1461
04:53:43,380 --> 04:53:47,639
On the stable walls, he said portal makes him feel sick. It does

1462
04:53:49,650 --> 04:53:51,169
Oh it does

1463
04:53:51,169 --> 04:53:53,169
It makes me feel like shit when I play it

1464
04:53:58,450 --> 04:53:59,970
Debris

1465
04:53:59,970 --> 04:54:02,180
How would you say it?

1466
04:54:02,180 --> 04:54:03,700
Debris

1467
04:54:03,700 --> 04:54:05,700
The different debris debris

1468
04:54:07,169 --> 04:54:08,450
debris

1469
04:54:08,450 --> 04:54:19,080
wooden animal body

1470
04:54:19,080 --> 04:54:21,959
Uh, is the plural of debris debris's or is it just debris?

1471
04:54:22,759 --> 04:54:26,500
debris's

1472
04:54:26,500 --> 04:54:27,639
Debris

1473
04:54:27,639 --> 04:54:30,770
You're lucky I didn't say debris to make you all fucking flip out

1474
04:54:31,569 --> 04:54:35,919
Okay, that's a little shortcut good

1475
04:54:36,560 --> 04:54:42,520
It's in here anything there is

1476
04:54:52,240 --> 04:55:08,880
Anything nope, okay, we need to go to the house with the chimney

1477
04:55:10,759 --> 04:55:12,919
And seek out the raven or whatever his name is

1478
04:55:13,479 --> 04:55:15,970
You could possibly move this somehow

1479
04:55:16,049 --> 04:55:34,369
You can move the tractor with something. What's this doing here? What is that doing there?

1480
04:55:39,080 --> 04:55:41,080
crazy frog moment

1481
04:55:50,279 --> 04:56:02,389
Do not enter do not enter crazy frogs workshop. Well, what's in the workshop?

1482
04:56:05,729 --> 04:56:07,799
What's going on

1483
04:56:07,799 --> 04:56:15,569
I love that so much. It's like my favorite thing in the world. So what's going on is my favorite sound effect

1484
04:56:15,650 --> 04:56:21,009
I think

1485
04:56:21,009 --> 04:56:23,810
It's up there. It could be it's really high. Whatever it is

1486
04:56:25,279 --> 04:56:27,279
Uh, this is a guy. It's like iron man

1487
04:56:27,840 --> 04:56:35,909
Look out the window. Whoa

1488
04:56:42,240 --> 04:56:50,720
Which one there's three

04:56:50,720 --> 04:56:57,000
Is it four thousand?

1490
04:56:57,000 --> 04:56:59,000
I don't know. This is the escape room

1491
04:56:59,080 --> 04:57:06,099
Look out the window

1492
04:57:06,159 --> 04:57:08,659

1493
04:57:22,990 --> 04:57:36,189
Sorry, sometimes it gets a little weird like that. Okay. Oh four we got oh seven. Oh seven. Oh four. Oh eight

1494
04:57:41,810 --> 04:57:43,810
Oh seven. Oh, how many numbers are there?

One two, three, four five. There's six numbers. So it's oh seven. Oh four. Oh eight open and

and

1498
04:58:14,939 --> 04:58:18,860
a jack handle

1499
04:58:18,860 --> 04:58:20,860
That's a new weapon. Hold on a second

1500
04:58:22,590 --> 04:58:29,009
Holy automatic handgun. This thing's fucking awesome. All right, I want to put this equip this

04:58:53,659 --> 04:58:55,659
I'm, not sure i'm gonna actually like this

1505
04:58:55,740 --> 04:59:07,580
All right, let's go back to the well over here

1506
04:59:13,200 --> 04:59:25,650
what

1507
04:59:25,650 --> 04:59:27,650
Shoot him with some shoot somebody

1508
04:59:27,650 --> 04:59:29,090
What am I doing?

1509
04:59:29,090 --> 04:59:55,599
I don't notice my voice is going like a lot recently. You notice that when I get really excited. It's like

1510
04:59:57,599 --> 04:59:59,599
It's really I don't know what's going on I think i'm getting older

1511
04:59:59,840 --> 05:00:10,130
He's some kind of item I think I have I have one and he's an other item don't I have one

1512
05:00:10,450 --> 05:00:12,209
It's like it's the jack, right?

1513
05:00:12,209 --> 05:00:24,819
I'm gonna have the jack this seems some kind of other item. I don't understand

1514
05:00:25,540 --> 05:00:40,720
Oh, maybe it's for the tractor. Yeah, it probably is for the tractor. You're right. All right, let's go

1515
05:00:43,340 --> 05:00:45,340
It's locked from the other side

1516
05:00:47,580 --> 05:00:55,360
Get up

1517
05:00:55,360 --> 05:01:00,159
All right. This same guy is just following me and pretending to be dead in different places

1518
05:01:00,799 --> 05:01:15,950
No, I feel I feel like i've seen this guy lying down dead like at every other scene not anymore

1519
05:01:24,319 --> 05:01:26,880
What the fuck the guy's fucking following me around

1520
05:01:34,000 --> 05:01:36,000
What the fuck my girlfriend's sleeping. You woke her up

1521
05:01:37,409 --> 05:01:39,409
Dude, we watch together

1522
05:01:40,299 --> 05:01:43,630
What are you talking about?

1523
05:01:43,709 --> 05:01:46,110
Well, what you're not watching together now, are you?

1524
05:01:46,750 --> 05:01:51,520
These sounds are so loud. It's so loud. Isn't it?

1525
05:01:52,159 --> 05:01:57,119
This game's too it's too loud for you guys a big strong loud blow up explosion noises happen all the time

1526
05:01:57,520 --> 05:02:06,000
I keep looking over here and i'm getting just drowned out. No, you know what it is

1527
05:02:06,560 --> 05:02:08,000
It's this

1528
05:02:08,000 --> 05:02:25,330
That's the problem. Okay. Now i'm good. I'm good now this can come back up. All right turn on rage

1529
05:02:25,330 --> 05:02:27,330
All right, I will turn ray tracing on

1530
05:02:27,889 --> 05:02:29,889
Like it I didn't see this guy

1531
05:02:39,970 --> 05:03:01,500
Fully automatic I wouldn't classify. This is fully automatic. All right, go this way. Wait, hold on any items

1532
05:03:04,049 --> 05:03:14,389
It's fully completely semi-automatic. It's fully completely kind of semi-automatic

1533
05:03:17,889 --> 05:03:28,799
I realistically I probably shouldn't even use it though

1534
05:03:33,759 --> 05:03:39,810
Because this is more powerful and until I upgrade it. It's probably not worth using the bullets with it, right?

1535
05:03:40,430 --> 05:03:46,709
Theoretically is a pig of animals nice in this game

1536
05:03:53,380 --> 05:03:55,459
All right, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I mean it didn't even hurt me

1537
05:03:55,540 --> 05:03:59,250
I'm not I don't have to kill it. Is it do I have to kill it? What can I feed it?

1538
05:04:01,990 --> 05:04:06,979
You eating the blood

1539
05:04:06,979 --> 05:04:24,049
You like is it good? It's a good pig. I pet him. He was just scared. I didn't know why would I shoot it?

1540
05:04:24,450 --> 05:04:50,900
I don't know nothing in here. Whatever. Okay. Well, I don't have a lot anymore lockpicks. So I got a

1541
05:04:51,860 --> 05:05:18,740
Chicken over there. Wait, why are these listed here? Why is there a chicken here? All right. I need to go to the chimney house

1542
05:05:18,740 --> 05:05:34,529
Where is it? It's over here. Go this way. All right, I gotta go back here. It's meat. Wait, I actually get meat from the pig

1543
05:05:38,959 --> 05:05:54,340
Really? You shitting me? Did I actually do that? Don't kill it. But I mean is it does it actually help?

1544
05:05:54,900 --> 05:06:10,049
You know, you're not gonna do the same thing, right? I don't want to kill the pig. It's gonna give meat

1545
05:06:11,939 --> 05:06:15,590
Pick a blt

1546
05:06:15,590 --> 05:06:21,029
I can't do it. I'll rather have a harder game. I can't do it. He's just hanging out. There's nothing. What did he do?

1547
05:06:22,360 --> 05:06:36,229
What did he do wrong? He rammed you. No, I startled him and then he freaked out

1548
05:06:36,310 --> 05:06:38,310
He had he ran at me because he was scared

1549
05:06:38,470 --> 05:06:43,270
All right. Here we go

1550
05:06:43,270 --> 05:06:45,270
You're on the roof. You're on the roof. Okay

1551
05:06:50,040 --> 05:06:58,680
That actually does that make them? Oh my god, i'm trying to shoot them both at the same time

1552
05:07:06,709 --> 05:07:09,990
He slipped he just slipped and exploded his head on the ground

1553
05:07:10,709 --> 05:07:18,049
I feel like I didn't even do that

1554
05:07:18,049 --> 05:07:24,720
All right. This is the house, right? No, it's not but might as well just look around

1555
05:07:29,110 --> 05:07:32,720
White bomb good

1556
05:07:32,720 --> 05:07:37,520
You'll kill zombies, but you won't kill the pig. The zombies are actively attacking me to trying to kill me

1557
05:07:38,419 --> 05:07:40,419
The pig ran by me and screamed

1558
05:07:40,979 --> 05:07:54,639
If that pig kept attacking me, you better believe I would have

1559
05:07:55,860 --> 05:07:57,860
That guy looks a little different

1560
05:08:02,950 --> 05:08:24,439
Is that hurting him? Holy shit. That guy took a lot of hits

1561
05:08:26,689 --> 05:08:29,439
perfect crystal skull

1562
05:08:29,520 --> 05:08:31,520
It's man bear pig

1563
05:08:36,900 --> 05:08:55,110
It kind of looks like what's that sign say lock due to missing homeowner. Hold on not yet open this

1564
05:08:55,909 --> 05:09:01,479
Oh, where's the door closing? Was the door closing? Whatever. Okay. I want to open this

1565
05:09:13,490 --> 05:09:16,369
Use the fucking knife. I have guns. Why would I use a knife?

1566
05:09:19,959 --> 05:09:25,240
Finally, I have the wheel well it took long enough took five plus hours into the game to get this item

1567
05:09:25,799 --> 05:09:32,389
All right. I'm gonna

1568
05:09:32,389 --> 05:09:35,990

05:09:35,990 --> 05:09:42,560
Back here, right?

1570
05:09:42,560 --> 05:09:44,560
All right, there's one well here

1571
05:09:44,799 --> 05:09:46,159

1575
05:10:06,869 --> 05:10:08,069
Where are you?

1576
05:10:08,069 --> 05:10:16,759
That's what the pig is. This is wrong

1577
05:10:17,400 --> 05:10:20,130
Go go go go go go

1578

1580
05:10:23,250 --> 05:10:30,340
Underneath we're gonna have to crawl underneath here. Kill the pig. I'm not killing the pig. It's not gonna happen

1581
05:10:30,900 --> 05:10:33,380
I'm not killing any of the animals unless they attack first

1582
05:10:34,020 --> 05:10:37,139

1583
05:10:46,680 --> 05:10:50,770
wheel well and

05:10:51,619 --> 05:10:53,619
Lockpick, okay, there's one

Wait, do I need to pick it back up? No, all right. The second one is

1586
05:11:01,700 --> 05:11:04,439
this way

1587
05:11:04,439 --> 05:11:08,930
Can't open that. So where's the other one if I go?

1588
05:11:09,729 --> 05:11:11,409
Down and then to the right

1589
05:11:11,409 --> 05:11:17,970

1590
05:11:21,240 --> 05:11:27,200

1667
05:20:34,240 --> 05:20:37,840
I got all the all right now. We have to go back to the house with the red chimney

1668
05:20:38,479 --> 05:20:41,909
That's the goal. That's what we're doing. That's what i'm doing. I'm going to the house with the red chimney

1669
05:20:41,909 --> 05:20:43,110

House with the red chimney is I fuck I've I don't know

1671
05:20:48,770 --> 05:20:55,080
Looks like we have to go back this way. It's blocked by trees. We have to go over here

1672
05:21:01,330 --> 05:21:05,299
No back through the church through the door down here

1673
05:21:05,939 --> 05:21:21,409
It's confusing. It is

1674
05:21:28,639 --> 05:21:30,639
It's confusing if you can't read a map

1675
05:21:31,040 --> 05:21:32,159
Look, dude

1676
05:21:32,159 --> 05:21:38,000
It's like half of these things are blocked half of them are blocked by my it's i'm playing a maze here

1677
05:21:38,159 --> 05:21:40,560
It's you have to just one step by step

1678
05:21:41,040 --> 05:21:50,549
It's it's difficult. It's not easy to read this half of these roads are blocked. Look, man

1679
05:21:53,000 --> 05:21:56,000
All right, i'm going

1680
05:21:56,000 --> 05:22:02,419
Down here and then like around here and through here. Okay, straight ahead. Let's go

1681
05:22:05,250 --> 05:22:08,290
And it doesn't look like the same thing way that look it's this is it's blocked

1682
05:22:08,689 --> 05:22:11,919
This is block. It's blocked up. Okay, so and now I can't go this way

1683
05:22:12,770 --> 05:22:21,680
Read the map andy, right? It's blocked half of them are locked from the other side

1684
05:22:26,389 --> 05:22:27,590
This is locked

1685
05:22:27,590 --> 05:22:44,479
I gotta go through here and then like where the fuck am I going?

1686
05:22:44,720 --> 05:23:04,959
I have to get back to like the place with the pig and some places you have to go through houses

1687
05:23:05,119 --> 05:23:18,369
Okay, hold on. Can I like get through this way? No, what I all right i'm going down this way and

1688
05:23:18,849 --> 05:23:29,669
How do I how did I get here?

1689
05:23:30,520 --> 05:23:36,849
Through here through here. This is blocked. I gotta go down. I can't go through here

1690
05:23:37,169 --> 05:23:43,840
This way that way this way that way is he high or something this map is fucking this map is dog shit

1691
05:23:44,240 --> 05:23:52,979
You can't get I can't give a shit map and then be like why we didn't go to the birthday party

1692
05:23:53,060 --> 05:23:55,060
This is because your directions were fucking terrible

1693
05:23:55,139 --> 05:24:02,080
Remember back like 20 years ago 15 years ago those of you that drove like 20 years ago 15 years ago

1694
05:24:02,560 --> 05:24:06,869
Before gps people used to give you the most absurd directions

1695
05:24:07,430 --> 05:24:11,909
Oh at the fourth light you'll look over there'll be a clown and take a left at the clown and there's no clown

1696
05:24:12,229 --> 05:24:17,380
There's absolutely no fucking clown and there's like 12 lights and you don't know which one to take the left at

1697
05:24:18,389 --> 05:24:39,220
I remember looking at directions that were written out. It was like 75 steps and I I can't go this way

1698
05:24:39,459 --> 05:24:48,549
This is locked. Can I like go through here?

1699
05:24:49,270 --> 05:24:51,990
And like out that where do I go?

1700
05:24:52,630 --> 05:24:56,229
How do I get out of here? I'm fucking trapped

1701
05:24:56,869 --> 05:25:06,900
I'm trapped here. There's one little specific route. I have to take through this fucking map

1702
05:25:13,240 --> 05:25:17,250
You keep turning at the clown there is no clown this way

1703
05:25:17,490 --> 05:25:26,180
No, and I would love to zoom out but I can't everything disappears. All right, settle down relax

1704
05:25:33,299 --> 05:25:35,939
I am gonna lose my mind. How do I get over here?

1705
05:25:39,319 --> 05:25:47,430
I can't go this way. So I have to go straight and then right and then

1706
05:25:49,250 --> 05:25:55,779
Back to where you got the wheel. I have no idea where that is right from where you are now

1707
05:25:58,709 --> 05:26:00,709
It's blocked off with a fucking wagon

1708
05:26:01,669 --> 05:26:20,560
Flying back under the tractor. I don't even know where that fucking tractor is man. Oh shit

1709
05:26:20,560 --> 05:26:34,790
It's like there's a fucking diamond in here teddy bear. I hit the jackpot down here. Okay now

1710
05:26:39,560 --> 05:27:08,580
Look at the statue. Nice. There's the red chimney left of the wagon

1711
05:27:40,240 --> 05:28:05,110
Where the where is somebody hack my computer and just do it for me. Oh

1712
05:28:06,150 --> 05:28:12,680
Why is it this confusing?

1713
05:28:13,560 --> 05:28:15,560
This should just be able to walk down the path

1714
05:28:16,580 --> 05:28:38,740
Why can't I just walk down a path go through the shack? This shit isn't even on the map

1715
05:28:39,060 --> 05:28:48,599
It's not even on the map. Okay. All right

1716
05:28:49,000 --> 05:29:01,919
Great. Now I gotta go through this shit and then like back around this

1717
05:29:03,200 --> 05:29:09,919
I'm gonna shock out of no i'm not relax

1718
05:29:10,159 --> 05:29:22,869
I just walked around in like three circles to do if I could just walk just over here

1719
05:29:23,029 --> 05:29:27,360
Oh

1720
05:29:27,840 --> 05:29:29,840
And go through the shack which oh

1721
05:29:30,659 --> 05:29:48,360
Through the door back to the window. Oh, I've got a little window through the door. Okay

1722
05:29:49,000 --> 05:29:56,470
What I fucking made it? I I can't even go in this door. I can't go in here. Oh my god

1723
05:29:57,569 --> 05:30:00,930
What is where and climb up the ladder?

1724
05:30:02,450 --> 05:30:30,869
You ski what's even in here?

1725

Relax

1726
05:31:07,799 --> 05:31:10,680
Yeah, wait, do I have to go back around and get on the ladder again?

1727
05:31:11,159 --> 05:31:22,680
Go through the house. Everything's just confusing me. I'm so confused right now

1728
05:31:22,919 --> 05:31:28,040
Every door is locked from the how many fucking doors are locked from the other side

1729
05:31:29,669 --> 05:31:33,669
Half of the shit in this game is locked. Everything's locked. What are these people doing in their houses?

1730
05:31:34,310 --> 05:31:56,599
Maybe that crystal i'm just throwing a fucking grenade into the chimney. All right, I made it i'm in your house

1731
05:31:57,080 --> 05:32:21,380
Who's in here? Do you not lock your door?

1732
05:32:23,169 --> 05:32:28,680
I what the fuck every door is locked from the other side. Everything's locked

1733
05:32:29,319 --> 05:32:33,009
Okay, is somebody this i'm so i'm just where is this person?

1734
05:32:33,650 --> 05:32:41,060
Oh my fucking god, it's gonna be like another the winged key is just a single piece three more parts

1735
05:32:41,060 --> 05:32:49,330
Are needed to make it a whole. Oh, no wing key is just one single piece three more parts are needed

1736
05:32:51,119 --> 05:32:53,119
combined with the winged key

1737
05:32:53,279 --> 05:32:57,840
I don't even know what I just did. Damn it. Better see the duke again

1738
05:32:58,080 --> 05:33:02,740
Oh god, I have to leave I have to leave I have to get out of the house

1739
05:33:03,380 --> 05:33:05,919
I have to go back to the duke

1740
05:33:07,159 --> 05:33:09,880
Who is over here? Oh, this is simple. Just walk out the door

1741
05:33:10,439 --> 05:33:19,889
Where is he this way?

1742
05:33:19,889 --> 05:33:22,580
Over here. All right. I'm good

1743
05:33:24,240 --> 05:33:29,970
Oh, you're an idiot. This map sucks. This game sucks. I'm kidding. It's a joke. Relax everybody

1744
05:33:33,840 --> 05:33:36,080
How was it? Did you learn anything?

1745
05:33:36,639 --> 05:33:42,099
I found these feathers now. Tell me how to fix this like you said you would settle i'm kidding

1746
05:33:42,099 --> 05:33:46,819
The game's fun first. You must use that key and collect all of your little roses flasks

1747
05:33:48,020 --> 05:33:50,020
Where are the rest of them?

1748
05:33:50,419 --> 05:33:52,419
There are four in total

1749
05:33:52,419 --> 05:33:55,619
You have the one and the other lords have the rest

1750
05:33:56,580 --> 05:34:01,400
lords

1751
05:34:01,400 --> 05:34:07,959
Mother miranda is the cold calculating ruler of this village four lords serve under her

1752
05:34:09,939 --> 05:34:12,759
The first you've already met the lady demetresque

1753
05:34:14,500 --> 05:34:20,439
The second lives deep in a valley of mist the dollmaker donna beneviento

1754
05:34:23,200 --> 05:34:27,680
Getting the hub world her playmates have ever come back from that dank old estate

1755
05:34:32,200 --> 05:34:37,880
The third is morrow a being of twisted flesh that lives in the reservoir past the windmills

1756
05:34:38,279 --> 05:34:43,479
He's pretty weak just one shotgun blast to his face. We'll do it in those waters

1757
05:34:47,680 --> 05:34:54,000
The fourth and most dangerous is heisenberg. He works in his factory on the village outskirts

1758
05:34:54,560 --> 05:34:57,220
the project

1759
05:34:57,220 --> 05:35:01,139
Let's just say parts of the human imagination are better left alone

1760
05:35:11,080 --> 05:35:16,069
Oh, okay. So we already claimed lady demetre

1761
05:35:17,909 --> 05:35:19,430

1765
05:35:30,479 --> 05:35:35,200
I'll do you a personal favor. I've marked the lord's locations on your map

1766
05:35:35,919 --> 05:35:42,720
Gonna pee again some treasures still lurk in this village. I'm sure each one will prove of great use to you

1767
05:35:43,840 --> 05:35:45,840
Well, thank you. Why are you doing all this?

1768
05:35:46,000 --> 05:35:49,750

Okay, inspect the teddy bear

1784
05:37:15,169 --> 05:37:19,729
I don't think it's

1785
05:37:19,729 --> 05:37:25,319
naturally

1786
05:37:25,319 --> 05:37:27,560

And i'll make some food too. Yeah

05:38:49,430 --> 05:38:51,430
I suppose you'd call this

1805
05:38:51,430 --> 05:38:53,430
a farewell to arms

This is permanent stuff. You get i'm gonna go why why would I not kill every animal?

1808
05:39:13,189 --> 05:39:17,290
Damage taken when guarding decreases permanently increases health permanently

1809
05:39:21,349 --> 05:39:25,669
Oh my god, I can't believe that I was so concerned about like killing the pig

1810
05:39:28,340 --> 05:39:31,299
All right. Well, um, let's do this one because I can make it

1811
05:39:36,450 --> 05:39:39,240
Okay, two two, right? Yes

05:39:40,040 --> 05:39:59,319
We've gathered all the ingredients health slightly increased permanently now for the weight. Here's your share

1813
05:40:00,119 --> 05:40:04,150
Sounds like you kind of just ate that in front of me

1814
05:40:05,479 --> 05:40:07,080
Not a bad dish

1815
05:40:07,080 --> 05:40:11,650
Okay, so now

1816
05:40:11,650 --> 05:40:15,490
poultry meat, okay, we just kill animals. That's all I need to know. All right, cool

1817
05:40:19,540 --> 05:40:21,939
We're gonna increase the rate of fire on this. No, we don't

1818
05:40:22,659 --> 05:40:27,459
Shotgun ammo capacity on the shotgun. Yes one moment, please and reload speed. Thank you

1819
05:40:28,580 --> 05:40:30,979
And let's make the sniper rifle more powerful. Yes

1820
05:40:31,619 --> 05:40:38,319
Sounds good to me. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons modifications and we'll do them for a small fee

1821
05:40:38,639 --> 05:40:41,520
You know what? Let's just just i'm just gonna buy a shitload. Just give me more rounds

1822
05:40:43,360 --> 05:40:49,360
What are you eyeing that one have a wonderful adventure? Thank you

1823
05:40:50,880 --> 05:40:53,360
Uh, I need to do some organization here

1824
05:40:54,080 --> 05:43:59,319
I gotta pee though. I'll be right back pee time. All right

1825
05:44:02,150 --> 05:44:07,090
so

1826
05:44:07,090 --> 05:44:11,639
Does anybody know i'm assuming i'm probably almost at the halfway point of the game

1827
05:44:12,279 --> 05:44:18,119
If I do one of these areas and I get two of four i'm assuming that's probably somewhere around halfway

1828
05:44:20,979 --> 05:44:28,200
maybe

1829
05:44:28,200 --> 05:44:30,200
so if I get another

1830
05:44:30,200 --> 05:44:32,229
piece of

1831
05:44:32,229 --> 05:44:37,029
Rose and that would be somewhere with that would be 33 percent

1832
05:44:37,750 --> 05:44:41,919
Let's let's we're going here's what we're gonna do

1833
05:44:43,590 --> 05:44:45,590
That'd be about 40 percent

1834
05:44:55,970 --> 05:45:01,330
Lady dimitrisu is about third of the way through the game. All right, so if i'm gonna get one more piece of rose

1835
05:45:02,740 --> 05:45:06,419
From one of these areas and then we'll see where we are, but we will finish it tomorrow

1836
05:45:06,900 --> 05:45:17,090
All right. Let me fix my inventory. What's this? Oh shit. This is the extra space. Nice. All right

1837
05:45:17,090 --> 05:45:26,720
Well, we're gonna put weapons over here

1838
05:45:26,720 --> 05:45:28,720
All guns all weapons all ammo

1839
05:45:29,430 --> 05:45:34,040
No, what are you doing? Oh

1840
05:45:34,439 --> 05:45:39,279
Okay, that's just to organize. I thought it was an extra backpack

1841
05:45:39,759 --> 05:45:46,799
First of all, let me read

1842
05:45:46,799 --> 05:45:49,560
Wait, what am I all my weapons are gone

1843
05:45:49,720 --> 05:45:51,240
Let me reload everything

1844
05:45:51,240 --> 05:45:56,099
Everything reloaded. Yes. All right

1845
05:45:57,299 --> 05:46:05,299
Okay, so we're gonna do weapons down here weapons on the right. That sounds good to me

1846
05:46:13,029 --> 05:46:16,639
uh, okay

1847
05:46:16,639 --> 05:46:19,680
Type bombs up here and the knife will spin it this way up here

1848
05:46:20,400 --> 05:46:22,770
This game's really good. I like this game a lot

1849
05:46:23,639 --> 05:46:25,799
Turn off your lights. No, but you won't be able to see me

1850
05:46:27,599 --> 05:46:29,599
I i'm it'll be just dark

1851
05:46:30,360 --> 05:46:32,360
Lights off you're not gonna be able to even see me

1852
05:46:40,759 --> 05:46:42,520
You don't want it like this

1853
05:46:42,520 --> 05:46:45,279
This sucks

1854
05:46:45,279 --> 05:46:47,279
And this sucks to play

1855
05:46:47,680 --> 05:46:57,000
I don't like this at all. Actually. I hate this. This is good. It's not good because i'm playing a video game in a dark room

1856
05:46:58,310 --> 05:47:15,909
No, i'm putting it back on i'm putting no. No, we're not doing that. It's scare saturdays

1857
05:47:16,610 --> 05:47:18,560
Yes, I know

1858
05:47:18,560 --> 05:47:22,319
All right. Let me get back to this. I really like this game. I'm gonna give this game an 8.6 right now

1859
05:47:23,040 --> 05:47:25,040
At this at this stage right now

1860
05:47:25,119 --> 05:47:30,319
It would be like an 8 9 or like an 8 8 at the moment if the fov was scalable

1861
05:47:30,720 --> 05:47:33,599
And if I didn't just get stuck and beg somebody to fucking help me

1862
05:47:34,400 --> 05:47:39,439
Be an 8 6 at the moment. It's really bad for your eyes. Yeah, I know it is. It's horrible for you

1863
05:47:39,439 --> 05:47:41,439
It's like really helpful for you. It's bad for your brain

1864
05:47:43,650 --> 05:47:47,169
All right handgun with the handgun shotgun with the shotgun

1865
05:47:47,889 --> 05:47:55,000
Shotgun with the shotgun, of course

1866
05:47:57,479 --> 05:48:00,450
Handgun with the handgun

1867
05:48:00,450 --> 05:48:03,409
This is magnum. I don't have a magnum, but whatever I guess

1868
05:48:05,889 --> 05:48:07,889
Uh, we'll put the health in the top right

1869
05:48:10,790 --> 05:48:12,880
meat down here

1870
05:48:12,880 --> 05:48:15,599
Magnum ammo is gonna go with the pistol just because why not

1871
05:48:16,240 --> 05:48:17,840
lock picks up here

1872
05:48:17,840 --> 05:48:19,599
explosive rounds

1873
05:48:19,599 --> 05:48:24,869
Up here right here. Yeah right here much better. All right, I like it good

1874
05:48:28,439 --> 05:48:30,439
But where's the sniper ammo?

1875
05:48:30,680 --> 05:48:37,729
I don't have any clean. This is clean. Wait, hold on

1876
05:48:42,529 --> 05:48:44,840
That's better. I like that better. Okay

1877
05:48:46,869 --> 05:48:59,799
Upright what about I have a magnum. Where's my mag? I don't have a magnum

1878
05:49:06,229 --> 05:49:09,400
Okay, that's better. I'm ready. So where should I go?

1879
05:49:09,959 --> 05:49:17,939
The treasure over here peaceful. Haley just gives 10 community subs

1880
05:49:18,580 --> 05:49:24,099
Thanks for the community subs peaceful. Haley. All right. I said that like let me let me do that better. Thanks for the 10

1881
05:49:25,060 --> 05:49:27,139
Community subs i'm not turning

1882
05:49:28,799 --> 05:49:33,439
I promised I wasn't gonna get angry. I wasn't gonna get angry today. I already broke that promise like three times

1883
05:49:34,000 --> 05:49:36,229
All right

1884
05:49:36,229 --> 05:49:39,840
Who do I want to go to?

1885
05:49:39,840 --> 05:49:42,159
I kind of want to go to like the weird little doll thing

1886
05:49:43,569 --> 05:49:45,569
That's where I want to go. I want to go to the doll

1887
05:49:45,650 --> 05:49:57,299
We're an rtx on I will before the stream turns off. I promise. Hey ink cat. Thanks for the five community subs

1888
05:49:58,340 --> 05:50:02,180
You know what so

1889
05:50:02,340 --> 05:50:05,090
That is up

1890
05:50:05,090 --> 05:50:11,060
Here down here. I'm assuming it's probably just up this way

1891
05:50:13,939 --> 05:50:20,900
This way dim the lights. I don't have a dimmer. I can't dim my lights

1892
05:50:29,119 --> 05:50:31,119
This is a good game though. I like this a lot

1893
05:50:32,119 --> 05:50:38,500
So far, this is better than resident evil 7 if I were to give you a comparison so far

1894
05:50:40,130 --> 05:50:44,529
Resident evil 7 was really fun for the first like two or three hours and then I kind of just thought the game was boring

1895
05:50:45,090 --> 05:50:49,319
This has been consistently still pretty good

1896
05:50:51,540 --> 05:50:53,540
All right, here we go. We're going towards

1897
05:50:54,259 --> 05:50:56,259
this little doll thing

1898
05:50:57,639 --> 05:51:00,200
Please move. I'm gonna get attacked by dolls. Aren't I?

1899
05:51:17,029 --> 05:51:19,029
I thought that was a stormtrooper helmet

1900
05:51:19,959 --> 05:51:25,720
Like right here. I'm not turning my lights off

1901
05:51:28,040 --> 05:51:50,310
No, the lights stay on

1902
05:51:50,310 --> 05:51:55,330
Ethan come with me. There's something I have to tell you. Mia. Yeah

1903
05:51:56,130 --> 05:51:58,580
What's going on? What's going on?

1904
05:52:01,189 --> 05:52:03,349
Don't don't let me I don't want to miss that treasure

1905
05:52:07,040 --> 05:52:15,319
Don't let me miss that treasure don't open

1906
05:52:20,400 --> 05:52:22,400
Ethan you have to fix her

1907
05:52:23,299 --> 05:52:25,299
Okay, i'll try

1908
05:52:26,959 --> 05:52:30,319
Heck dude, what the heck is this? Don't be so offensive to me

1909
05:52:35,939 --> 05:52:37,380
This can't be real

1910
05:52:37,380 --> 05:52:45,830
I'm gonna invest in a lamp you absolute man. I don't want to live recess lighting. I don't want a lamp

1911
05:52:46,709 --> 05:52:57,409
All right. Here's the treasure

1912
05:52:57,409 --> 05:52:59,490
a

1913
05:52:59,650 --> 05:53:06,069
Viento 1987 to 1996 freed from the binds of flesh. She now walks the valley of death

1914
05:53:11,189 --> 05:53:15,919
Beneviento's treasure

1915
05:53:15,919 --> 05:53:26,279
Losing it. I don't think I can open this yet. I can't open that. I think it probably probably opens when I like kill beneviento

1916
05:53:38,630 --> 05:53:40,310
Put it in the mail slot

1917
05:53:40,310 --> 05:53:48,689
What's going on? Oh, what the fuck? Okay. That was very strange

1918
05:53:50,400 --> 05:53:53,680
Yeah, i'll do this. I'm gonna like make it so the uh

1919
05:53:54,400 --> 05:53:57,330
Let me just change this so like the it's not gonna ready

1920
05:53:57,970 --> 05:54:02,180
I'll darken it

1921
05:54:02,180 --> 05:54:12,290
There i'm making some people go. Okay. All right. Finally finally we can see

1922
05:54:13,909 --> 05:54:19,139
Now I well that's just making me look like it's like turning into a silhouette

1923
05:54:25,880 --> 05:54:29,650
Should I be like hold on ready?

1924
05:54:29,650 --> 05:54:30,930
Hold on. Give me a second

1925
05:54:30,930 --> 05:54:36,709
Like i'm i'm like one of those people that's just like blacked out doing one of those interviews

1926
05:54:36,709 --> 05:54:40,950
But they don't want you to know who they are, but i'm screaming. I'm a streamer. I just don't want you to know

1927
05:54:52,240 --> 05:54:54,240
Okay, so uh

05:55:10,419 --> 05:55:11,700
Okay

1930
05:55:11,700 --> 05:55:15,939
That sounds pretty good

1931
05:55:15,939 --> 05:55:17,700
Imagine watching

1932
05:55:17,700 --> 05:55:19,779
Imagine watching this fucking stream. Hold on

1933
05:55:31,200 --> 05:55:33,520
Uh, like like for privacy purposes

1934
05:55:34,400 --> 05:55:49,430
That's good

1935
05:55:49,430 --> 05:56:10,229
So i'm just gonna stream like that

1936
05:56:15,840 --> 05:56:19,939

And i'm not saying that because we're playing resident evil

1942
05:56:44,479 --> 05:56:46,919
He really was saying he was a timer. He was a terrible guy

1943
05:56:47,560 --> 05:56:51,430
You're not gonna we're not gonna use this anywhere, right? We're gonna make you make sure nobody can hear me

1944

1952
05:57:47,840 --> 05:57:49,599
I watched it happen

1953
05:57:49,599 --> 05:57:52,880
And I know I know who did it and I just gotta be careful

Goku somebody's shadow right there. Who's the secret streamer?

1962
05:58:50,080 --> 05:58:54,180
That's so stupid

1963

Hello everybody, my name is markiplier and today i'm gonna be playing in some resident evil village

05:59:42,319 --> 05:59:45,040
All right, I have to play the game. Uh, when can I turn this off?

1970
05:59:45,599 --> 05:59:50,959
This is literally sus. I don't know what that means. I'm not even I don't even play video games

1971
05:59:59,060 --> 06:00:00,500
Whoa

1972
06:00:00,500 --> 06:00:02,500
My god, that's terrifying

1973
06:00:16,470 --> 06:00:23,959
Let me uh here I figured you out. I'm contacting the thieves. Oh, yeah

1974
06:00:24,119 --> 06:00:27,799
Oh look at you. Oh look at me. Look at you. You think you know who this is?

1975
06:00:28,360 --> 06:00:30,720
What an idiot. What an idiot

1976
06:00:31,799 --> 06:00:55,430
It's impossible. It doesn't break what I move this

1977
06:00:56,950 --> 06:01:12,880
What the hell is going on in this house? What's happening in here? I feel like this is gonna be a really fun area though

1978
06:01:18,360 --> 06:01:20,520
Weird. I don't like oh, I don't like this doll stuff

1979
06:01:21,080 --> 06:01:24,479
This doll stuff is really starting to creep me out. I'm gonna get knocked off the table

1980
06:01:24,959 --> 06:01:27,279
They're gonna start chasing me and shit. I know they are

1981
06:01:38,529 --> 06:01:41,409
Uh, this is looks like corn

1982
06:01:44,979 --> 06:01:46,020
Plates

1983
06:01:46,020 --> 06:01:49,799
No, nothing even in here

1984
06:01:49,880 --> 06:02:03,279
This little doll person is going to be in one of these cabinets, right?

1985
06:02:03,759 --> 06:02:08,080
That person's so little they could be anywhere. That's terrifying

1986
06:02:11,669 --> 06:02:13,669
Doi doi doi. I don't know what that is

1987
06:02:14,630 --> 06:02:17,130
But if I was going to do it, maybe it would sound something like this

1988
06:02:28,240 --> 06:02:31,759
It sounds the same

1989
06:02:33,119 --> 06:02:36,680
Doi doi doi

06:04:05,509 --> 06:04:17,520
Okay, I open that. No, this looks like the

Resident evil house from the first game an herb. Oh, it's that thing. It's that corn

2013
06:05:38,720 --> 06:05:58,240
Wait, hold on. Wait a minute. What did I just do? What does what just happened? I think I broke the webcam

2346
06:54:12,819 --> 06:54:28,529
Wouldn't it it's like a button take like the head off pull like a leg off?

2347
06:54:29,009 --> 06:54:34,630

I go run. I the wounds are severe. I won't last much longer. I can hear it shuffling about outside

2479
07:11:44,279 --> 07:11:47,959
It barely flinched when I shot it. I feel like it's toying with me. That isn't a wolf

2480
07:11:48,919 --> 07:11:53,799
Still I won't lie down like a dog if I can get to the old water mill. I can stop it

2481
07:11:54,439 --> 07:11:58,450
I can protect you. It's so close damn. I'm so close. My legs don't work

Should I just blow him up? Can I just kill this thing like just by killing it like attacking it?

2510
07:17:57,509 --> 07:18:02,560
Or should I just not be an idiot and do do it do the way that I think i'm supposed to do

2511
07:18:02,959 --> 07:18:11,650
It's clean. You can kill it

2512
07:18:12,130 --> 07:18:18,869
You can kill it. It's not that crazy. All right, let's just fuck him up

2513
07:18:20,610 --> 07:18:23,250
You suck at gaming. That's not the question I asked

2514
07:18:23,810 --> 07:18:27,360
Let's just send him to hell

2515
07:18:27,360 --> 07:18:44,919
All right. Where's the where's the plan here? The plan is unlock this door first of all

2516
07:18:45,720 --> 07:18:50,950

2517
07:18:50,950 --> 07:19:00,099
Wait, it didn't say I can like kill him at the water wheel. Just don't miss

2518
07:19:00,979 --> 07:19:02,500
I'll try not to

07:19:02,500 --> 07:19:21,729
I'm gonna let's go i'm getting him. I got a new shiny rocket launcher. I'm gonna shove this into his mouth

2520
07:19:22,369 --> 07:19:26,020
What's the trajectory like? I don't know

2521
07:19:26,020 --> 07:19:43,729
Where the hell is he? How many more how many more another one you want another one? How's that?

2522
07:19:47,590 --> 07:19:48,869
Wow

2523
07:19:48,869 --> 07:19:53,099
This is like wario like waluigi

2524
07:19:58,930 --> 07:20:03,270
That hurt me

2525
07:20:03,270 --> 07:20:15,540

2527
07:20:18,099 --> 07:20:19,860

2528
07:20:19,860 --> 07:20:23,490
Okay. Now we just I can I can just walk through without any problems at all

2529
07:20:24,209 --> 07:20:28,119
I got the grenade launcher. I'm

2530
07:20:28,759 --> 07:20:30,759

2531
07:20:30,759 --> 07:20:36,950

Nothing else, right? Yeah, we're good. Remember the ego man has a ps4

2536
07:21:27,909 --> 07:21:31,349
I don't blame him for having a ps4. It's not worth getting a ps5 yet

2537
07:21:32,229 --> 07:21:34,470
Probably won't be for like another year

2538
07:21:41,840 --> 07:21:43,840
Talk from the other side. All right, I gotta kill these pigs

2539
07:21:48,290 --> 07:21:54,500
Follow me it's because they're still releasing games with ps4

2540
07:21:55,830 --> 07:21:58,549
Most things that come up ps5 just come up ps4. Anyways, don't they still?

2541
07:22:00,209 --> 07:22:03,250
It's like three or four games you can only get on ps4 right ps5, right?

2542
07:22:07,430 --> 07:22:11,990
Yes, I mean maybe like in a year. They'll have a bunch of stuff. Yeah, that's good. I didn't say the ps5 sucks

2543
07:22:12,869 --> 07:22:17,319
Don't hurt me. All right. I got it. I have all right. We got to do it

That's the white pig that I didn't kill

2548
07:22:58,240 --> 07:23:00,319
I shotgun him in the head once

2549
07:23:01,200 --> 07:23:12,000
And let him live

2550
07:23:12,000 --> 07:23:14,479
I don't think I I don't I know I don't think I killed it

2551
07:23:18,900 --> 07:23:20,900
God damn it. I don't think I did

2552
07:23:28,450 --> 07:23:30,450
I did kill him. Are you sure?

2553
07:23:30,770 --> 07:23:32,290

2554
07:23:32,290 --> 07:23:38,930
This stuff too. I don't I don't get what this stuff is for

2555
07:23:44,020 --> 07:23:46,900
You definitely killed one pig. Yeah, but it wasn't like the rare pig

2556
07:23:48,180 --> 07:23:50,740
All right. Well, I have to go get this thing from the there's definitely like a

07:23:51,459 --> 07:23:54,419
Just the thing I gotta get down here. It's like a laboratory down here

2558
07:23:54,979 --> 07:23:59,299

How far in the game am I right now?

2563
07:24:27,380 --> 07:24:38,689
percentage wise

2564
07:24:38,689 --> 07:24:40,529
More than a little bit more than halfway

2565
07:24:40,529 --> 07:24:43,409
45 50 percent

2566
07:24:43,490 --> 07:24:47,650
55. Okay. So after I do this portion, I'll be about 60 percent of the way

2567
07:24:54,479 --> 07:25:01,110
All right, let's see it. All right, cool. We'll see how I feel. I don't know

2675
07:41:02,580 --> 07:41:05,299
Why did you kill those fishes?

2676
07:41:06,020 --> 07:41:08,659
There was no reason for you to do that

2677
07:41:09,380 --> 07:41:13,729
Those were my friends

2678
07:41:14,450 --> 07:41:24,880

2679
07:41:24,880 --> 07:41:33,590
He's just a giant fish guy

2680
07:41:33,909 --> 07:41:35,750
All right. Well, he's just a big fish

2681
07:41:35,750 --> 07:41:43,189

Oh, it's this guy. Okay

2684
07:42:00,770 --> 07:42:20,450
How do I get in that room?

2685
07:42:20,450 --> 07:42:22,659
Oh, that's okay

2686
07:42:22,659 --> 07:42:24,580

Crystal beast that is yeah, so that was worth it killing him

2690
07:42:34,659 --> 07:42:40,659
This should be enough. All right. I did get some new shit though. Let's see

2691
07:42:41,459 --> 07:42:43,919
Yeah, I can't upgrade the grenade launcher. That's annoying

2692
07:42:46,659 --> 07:42:51,569
Pay me no mind. He's selling these food

2693
07:42:53,349 --> 07:42:54,549

Hmm. I mean, I don't know

2697
07:43:14,689 --> 07:43:18,470
Oh, it's because they have all their upgrades that makes sense

2698
07:43:19,750 --> 07:43:25,959
I feel like I should get the shotgun thing

2699
07:43:27,939 --> 07:43:29,060
What do you think?

2700
07:43:29,060 --> 07:43:30,740
Should I just save money?

2701
07:43:30,740 --> 07:43:32,979
I don't really even need it though. I don't I really don't need it

This crank is old and busted up. It feels like it's going to snap any second

2738
07:46:43,189 --> 07:46:47,669
I hope it doesn't break. The only other one we have is at the windmill over at windmill two

2742
07:47:17,740 --> 07:47:20,389
Seriously

2743
07:47:20,389 --> 07:47:22,790
Why would it have not broken? Of course, it's gonna break

07:48:16,689 --> 07:48:19,459

2754
07:48:28,069 --> 07:48:30,069

I think I have enough another fan's not gonna work tomorrow. Do not jinx me like that, please

2757
07:48:50,000 --> 07:48:53,119
I I should be at like the halfway mark. You think i'll be able to do it tomorrow?

2758
07:48:53,680 --> 07:48:59,430
If I do like another solid like five to six hours tomorrow, you think i'll finish the game. I should I should right?

2759
07:48:59,750 --> 07:49:04,799
I get this guy the hammer guy and then whatever the last part of the game is. Yeah. Yeah, that's

2760
07:49:06,159 --> 07:49:10,610
It's easy as long as I don't delay andy. Yeah, I won't

07:49:11,009 --> 07:49:25,970
Yes, I thought he was eating that book, okay good let's make it damage taken when guarding decreases permanently or wait

2762
07:49:26,290 --> 07:49:33,400
I'll still have enough to do this, but i'll need more meat to do this one

2763
07:49:34,400 --> 07:49:36,720
I don't I don't think I I don't I don't think i've guarded once

2764
07:49:37,759 --> 07:49:40,319
So i'm not gonna use it. I'll use it later

2765
07:49:42,130 --> 07:49:44,130
All right, save the game

2766
07:49:47,139 --> 07:49:52,580
What time tomorrow we're gonna start around 2 pm tomorrow 2 pm pacific

2767
07:49:53,139 --> 07:49:59,360

2768
07:50:00,389 --> 07:50:02,389
2 pm. Oh rtx, right? We'll do rtx

2769

2771
07:50:09,319 --> 07:50:29,750
Look, I turned this down because I was scared ray tracing. Let's go. It worked ray tracing on. Hi. Hi

2772
07:50:30,150 --> 07:50:34,130
Here we go

2773
07:50:34,130 --> 07:50:35,729
ray tracing on

2774
07:50:35,729 --> 07:51:17,830
Did I not apply it?

2775
07:51:17,830 --> 07:51:22,020
I need a light source

2776
07:51:22,020 --> 07:51:26,580
Is this doing anything?

2777
07:51:26,580 --> 07:51:39,810
I mean that's like kind of cool

2778
07:51:39,810 --> 07:51:46,580
Restarted yeah, it's because there's no like shiny floors. I need a shiny floor to look at

2779
07:51:48,360 --> 07:51:50,979
Yeah, there's no shiny floor to look at

2780
07:51:51,060 --> 07:51:56,099
Eh streaming at 720. We're not gonna see anything. Actually, let me see if I can get that for tomorrow, too

2781
07:51:57,590 --> 07:52:03,540
Shoot the gun

2782
07:52:03,540 --> 07:52:05,060
Whoa, look at that

2783
07:52:05,060 --> 07:52:15,750
Was it doing that before?

2784
07:52:15,750 --> 07:52:17,750
I don't it may have actually been doing that before

2785
07:52:18,150 --> 07:52:29,840
I don't think anything changed

2786
07:52:29,840 --> 07:52:33,669
Just don't save it

2787
07:52:33,669 --> 07:52:34,549
All right

2788
07:52:34,549 --> 07:52:37,029
Uh, we'll try to finish it tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow at two o'clock

07:52:37,830 --> 07:52:45,509
Yes

2790
07:52:45,509 --> 07:52:47,509
Ray tracing looked good

2791
07:52:49,090 --> 07:52:52,610
Yeah, I think would be probably you'd want to do that in like the mansion

2792
07:52:55,060 --> 07:52:56,900
Actually, hold on

2793
07:52:56,900 --> 07:53:07,590

07:53:10,279 --> 07:53:20,150
Okay ray tracing is on

2796
07:53:20,150 --> 07:53:25,400
Okay, that actually looks pretty fucking cool

2797
07:53:28,099 --> 07:53:29,619
It actually does

2798
07:53:29,619 --> 07:53:31,060
Look really good

2799
07:53:31,060 --> 07:53:37,380
That looks really nice

2800
07:53:37,380 --> 07:53:45,590
Don't let the the auto save might mess up. Oh shit. Will it?

2801
07:53:49,139 --> 07:53:51,139
No, it's not gonna fuck it up, right?

2802
07:53:53,279 --> 07:53:54,720
Yeah, we're good. Okay

2803
07:53:54,720 --> 07:53:55,759
all right

2804
07:53:55,759 --> 07:53:58,450
Let me see if I can do uh

2805
07:53:58,450 --> 07:54:00,450
I'm gonna try to go to 900p

2806
07:54:00,450 --> 07:54:03,840
If I can

2807
07:54:03,840 --> 07:54:07,680
So tomorrow if all goes to plan this will be a 900p stream

2808
07:54:08,240 --> 07:54:15,459
Because I got an I got I gotta be careful though. I I got a replacement of the fans

2809
07:54:19,080 --> 07:54:20,520
Even this looks good, too

2810
07:54:20,520 --> 07:54:25,939
All right. Well, thanks for watching. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Let's try to finish resident evil village

2811
07:54:26,659 --> 07:54:28,500
I ran out of gas

2812
07:54:28,500 --> 07:54:31,360
We'll eat something

2813
07:54:31,360 --> 07:54:32,479
Uh, I

2814
07:54:32,479 --> 07:54:35,349
Sorry said fuck capcom. I don't mean that

2815
07:54:35,750 --> 07:54:40,069
I did very much so at the very beginning of the stream because I can't believe that a company in 2021

2816
07:54:40,470 --> 07:54:42,470
Would put a game on a pc

2817
07:54:42,630 --> 07:54:46,150
And have hard locked the the fucking fov. I don't I find that to be impossible

2818
07:54:46,950 --> 07:54:49,349
It's like they almost like it has to have been done on purpose

2819
07:54:49,990 --> 07:55:02,209
Still the wait the baby was the nascar fuel

2820
07:55:03,169 --> 07:55:04,930
That I just burnt through

2821
07:55:04,930 --> 07:55:08,869
I pretty much did

2822
07:55:08,869 --> 07:55:11,189
I blew out my voice during that segment

2823
07:55:12,069 --> 07:55:16,950
I can't wait to see the embarrassing clips and gifts that i'm gonna feed through in the bath later

2824
07:55:17,889 --> 07:55:19,889
And I cringe in the bathtub

2825
07:55:20,049 --> 07:55:28,549
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for watching

2826
07:55:28,549 --> 07:55:32,389
Thanks to all the subs. There were a lot of gifted subs today. I missed a bunch of them. I was very very much

2827
07:55:34,000 --> 07:55:36,500
in the zone here

2828
07:55:36,500 --> 07:55:44,290
Thanks a lot everybody

2829
07:55:44,290 --> 07:55:46,290
I'm now going to eat something to eat

2830
07:55:47,029 --> 07:55:49,590
And shut up and stop talking till tomorrow

2831
07:55:50,310 --> 07:55:53,430
Otherwise, it's gonna be really interesting waking up with a broken voice

2832
07:55:54,150 --> 07:55:59,080
like I was at a

2833
07:55:59,080 --> 07:56:01,080
Soccer game or something. I was just screaming

2834
07:56:02,000 --> 07:56:05,279
No, no, I feel like I was at my son's baseball game

2835
07:56:06,599 --> 07:56:22,229
And I was really really proud of them. It's already great. Yeah, i'm gonna stop talking

2836
07:56:24,919 --> 07:56:27,400
Drink tea. Yeah, i'll have some tea. That sounds good

2837
07:56:28,040 --> 07:56:34,869
All right. I'll give you the my rating of the game so far is still an 8.6. It stays there

2838
07:56:36,400 --> 07:56:40,319
We'll see how it ends. It might drop a few points tomorrow. It might go up a few points. I don't know

2839
07:56:40,400 --> 07:56:45,650
I think it's really good

07:56:45,650 --> 07:56:51,409
Why is it not a 9 because it's locked at 80 fov and I find that to be fucking embarrassing and i'm not afraid to say it

2841
07:57:05,619 --> 07:57:21,029
If the fov mod is like easy to get I might just put it on tomorrow do a raid. Well, let's raid tomorrow

2842
07:57:21,349 --> 07:57:33,669
I feel like it's really late right now. We'll do a raid tomorrow. I'll dump you guys somewhere tomorrow. It's like 3 a.m

2843
07:57:34,229 --> 07:57:47,750
This time it's like 2 3 a.m eastern right now. It's very late

2844
07:57:50,400 --> 07:57:54,360
All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Have a great night

2845
07:57:54,840 --> 07:57:56,740
Goodbye

2846
07:57:56,740 --> 07:58:03,349
Oh my god. All right. I'm not talking anymore. Thanks for sticking around to know

2847
07:58:03,909 --> 07:58:05,909
A lot of you stayed up late. So

2848
07:58:05,909 --> 07:59:08,930
See you tomorrow. Have a good night
