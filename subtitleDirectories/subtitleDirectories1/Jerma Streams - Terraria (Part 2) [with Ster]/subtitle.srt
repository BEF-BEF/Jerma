00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,450
Hello everybody. Hi. Hope you're doing well. Sorry for starting late.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,500
We had some multiplayer issues. We were just sitting here figuring it out. I think we figured

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:23,739
it out. We're good. Thankfully didn't take too long, but we kept on getting disconnected to

4
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:29,579
each other. Had to try some. Okay. Well, hey, ladies and gentlemen, there he is.

5
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:41,159
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. No. No. Hello. All right. Well, let's mute this.

6
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,079
Let's mute them so I can do my intro. That was very loud. Did you just drive by? Was that you?

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,929
That was me. All right. Give me a sec. Give me a sec. Gone. But yeah, we're going to play some

8
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,579
motor area. We're just to pick up right where we left off last week. Continuing the training

9
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,409
session. Oh, I didn't mute on his side. Sorry, dude.

10
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,780
All right. Oh, you can, you guys didn't hear what he just said. So I'm like on both ends,

11
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,900
you, I'm talking to you and they don't hear you. And then I was talking to them and you don't hear,

12
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,540
you know what I mean? Like I just ruined that whole thing. Is this your first time?

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:35,700
Um, first time streaming 375th or something like that. I think. Okay. Well, um,

14
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,719
you'll get better. All right. We don't even need an intro. We're already here.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,239
So we're starting late. So let's go. Those of you that don't know what Terraria is. Um, it's a base

16
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:52,920
building block exploration game where I know and that let's go. It's 2D Minecraft. Your guys ever

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:01,459
played Minecraft? When's the Minecraft stream German? I already did it. Did you? Yeah. Dude,

18
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,260
you're a trending gamer. You know, I did. I've played Minecraft like six times in the last,

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:15,610
like three years. I think you need a new playthrough. I will never do a playthrough of

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,900
Minecraft again. I might open it and like fall down into lava once or twice for like a couple

21
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,539
hours and build a dirt house, but I'm not going to do like a full play through it. You know,

22
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,139
it would take a million dollars to beat the ender dragon. I mean, it would take,

23
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:42,729
if you have a million dollars, I'll do it. Wow. Wow. Okay. So play Terraria. He wants a million.

24
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:51,639
Okay. Why do you think a man now? I got a nice fat check for Mr. Stir. Hey, I'm going to invite you

25
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,439
to the squad stream. Cause my chat's telling me to do it. How did you start streaming?

26
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,110
It's yeah, it's been on. Don't let this be like last time where you didn't think I was streaming

27
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,189
for like four hours. No, I knew you, I knew you were streaming. I mean, you're just like,

28
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:18,310
want to squad up apparently. That's what they want. So where we last left off, hey,

29
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,430
we're not in hard mode yet. We haven't killed the wall. We were in the dungeon and um,

30
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,669
but we want to do before we kill the wall. And the last thing we were going to do is get you that

31
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:36,870
sick new summoner armor step. That's right. Do that. We need to go get some water candles from

32
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,870
the dungeon. Hey, drama left the game. No, I didn't. It said you left. So we can do this rejoin,

33
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:55,189
uh, thing for like another 20 minutes. Hey, sweet. Everybody watching you all missed it,

34
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,030
but you know how we rejoined and tried to join each other and talked about how dog

35
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:08,810
shit steam is for like 20 minutes so we can do it all again. All right. Pretty good. Pretty good

36
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:19,139
stuff. All right. Um, hold on. So you want to try this, uh, because again, yeah. Oh yeah. I

37
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:29,269
have to invite you. Hello. Who do I watch? Germa or story? You can see both with the squad stream.

38
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,990
Hello. Okay. You're gonna invite. I did this did this last time though. Do you remember this did

39
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,629
this last time it did. And then it was fine. But like you need to be able to rejoin. I hopefully

40
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,310
again and I can, I'm here. So let's hope that that looks, it's just like there's what happens

41
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,790
when you play terraria. Yeah. Okay. It's, it's the first time, first time jitters. The game was

42
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:58,170
nervous. All right. You ready? I'm ready. Uh, here there's one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Before we go,

43
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,089
while it's nighttime, we're going to end up needing demonite bars. So we're going to have

44
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:11,050
to kill a boss that drops demonite bars. Demonite bars. Yeah. I think we can just kill the eye.

45
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,740
No, how many bars do we need? Uh, a bit. I think we might have to kill it twice and then we can

46
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,139
walk to the dungeon. Where's it going? And you can remember how to play. I know, I know how to play.

47
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,459
Well, you wanted the refresher. You know, this is just like, Hey, reminder, everyone

48
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,620
welcome back. We're the guys. I'm melting him right now. I'm melting him right now.

49
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:51,529
I'm hit. I took a hit. I took a few hits. I took like six hits. All right, we're good.

50
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,350
Okay. We're good. How many bars? Uh, it gives it or so. I don't know. Why is it two? I made another

51
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,360
one. We're going to need another one because I, I used all of our demonite bars to make

52
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:13,540
storage. You get hit. I got hit. He's killing our guy. Why can he go in there? There's a wall.

53
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:22,089
He doesn't give a shit. Oh, good job. Now he dropped all of his things in there and then

54
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:30,779
mine and you can have them. That's a dated reference. What did I do for a dated reference?

55
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:41,379
What did I do? What did I say? I don't know. Uh, but that's probably enough. Do you have enough

56
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:53,620
bars? Uh, we will, but we have to go to the dungeon and get a water candle. You said can I

57
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,459
has cheeseburger. I did not say that. Take this, take, take, take, take, take that. Don't like deep

58
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:07,850
fake thought that shit on me. All right. I got it. And that's a charm. So don't call him Jay.

59
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,610
That's my mom's name. What? Oh, that's true. Actually he's Jay nine to five. All right. What

60
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,290
is this a spirit? This is the, uh, the one with the minions, right? Yeah. But what don't I have

61
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,370
like a double jump right now? And don't I need that because of my training wheels? Your own

62
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,050
training wheels. Yes. Uh, so when we come back, I'll make you the full set and then you'll wear

63
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,050
the full set. Oh, like for now double jumps. Right. Pretty good. Double jump is important

64
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,250
for somebody that's on training bills. Oh dude, he's selling a kimono. Oh, I thought that was a B.

65
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,930
What does he got? He's selling a kimono.

66
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:54,389
You could just call me Jeremy, you know. You're right. Okay. I'm going to store some things and

67
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:01,139
we're going. You sure? Yeah. I have three bananas. What do you do with these?

68
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:13,560
You can have them. I hate you. Oh, I see. I think I killed somebody. Oops. That's just,

69
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,759
that's how it is. What is this? Did we, did we make this? Who made this? Yeah, that's my,

70
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,449
I don't want to tell you what that is. Let's go. All right. I'm going. So do you eventually get like

71
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:31,930
speed increases like times two speed or extra speed or you get boots that let you sprint,

72
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,289
you get wings that let you fly and move faster. You can also, right now you should have the hook,

73
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:43,769
right? And give you a hook. If you hook the ground, it'll like pull you towards it faster than

74
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:53,820
your move speed. That's really cool. You technically could lay down wire all the way across the map to

75
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,769
build a teleporter or you can make like mine cart tracks. Wait, wait, am I going the right way?

76
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:12,100
We're not even the same party. You're going the right way. Okay. Did I miss anything? No.

77
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:24,009
This is our first time playing together in four years. I didn't think he would talk to me again,

78
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:36,840
but here we are. Why did you think that? You know, the money. Oh, right. The money handle

79
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,639
the money. It was, you didn't say you've already forgotten about the money.

80
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:50,279
I never forget. I never forget about the money. Oh, I remember I did that.

81
00:09:51,080 --> 00:10:01,289
Is it one? What happened? No, none. You left again. No, I mean that Mike, that was like a full on,

82
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:07,700
like the game hard crashed. That wasn't a disconnect. Terraria like hard crashed.

83
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:17,960
I don't even have it open anymore. That's good news. I just want to play. What the fuck?

84
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,940
I mean, I played with Ashley for like two days straight, maybe three. She never,

85
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,500
she never crashed. Why am I crashing now? Are you sure that we don't have to like update mods or

86
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:39,110
something? Yes. You're sure? I'm sure. Okay. I mean, I'll just, I'll just run the errand by myself.

87
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:46,139
Just wait. I'm almost here. It's really like we just have to like grab a candle. It doesn't matter.

88
00:10:46,139 --> 00:11:02,519
Okay. Can't run a sprite based game. I mean, it's tough. Yeah. See, I got like everything all set,

89
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,899
right? What the fuck was up with that? That's weird. Yeah. That was like a, like,

90
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:13,460
like I didn't, I couldn't move. I couldn't do, like the game just exited.

91
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:23,110
Maybe it's, maybe it's me. Is it you, you think? And maybe, no, it's a, I'm the problem,

92
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,029
you know? All right. I'll be ready. Whenever you're ready, I'll be ready.

93
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,019
Oh yeah. I'm just, I'm just running an errand. So I can't, you have to invite me. I can't just

94
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:48,179
join off you. I did invite you. You did invite me. I don't see it. Invite friends. Oh, there it is.

95
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:56,940
Got it. Okay. He had it already. All right. Joining stir. He had it already. Hopefully my fucking game

96
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:13,750
doesn't crash. Uh, he had it already. All right. Hey, let's do like strike three. I think last week

97
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,159
someone was saying, well, that wouldn't be a problem either. I'm going to ignore what that

98
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,799
guy said and forget what that guy said. I'm going to repeat it. It's disgusting. Don't tell him.

99
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:31,259
He won't know it's me. Yeah. Hello. Um, no, but like what, what, what's, what's the problem?

100
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:50,169
I don't know. I don't know, dude. Pepe face. Yeah. I'm going to go find me and you like backup plan.

101
00:12:50,169 --> 00:13:02,649
You can always just play games made 40 years ago. It's fun to do that though. Yeah. Did you get

102
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:08,340
the item? What did you get the item? Um, yeah, I'm just grabbing a few more while I'm here.

103
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:18,259
I'm being productive and I want to come back here. That's like the sec. That's like the third loud

104
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:24,679
fucking driver. It is. We're getting a lot. And that's what happens when you live in Manhattan.

105
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:38,659
Are you next to a highway or is it just like, it's just Vegas, Vegas, baby.

106
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:49,539
DOS is 40 years old. Is it real? What? I had no health. What? I dropped 47 gold.

107
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:03,539
I'm doing a great job. Um, I should go back there. I'm doing a great job. I'm,

108
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm just like a fucking animal in your server. Where are you? What do you like to know? Oh,

109
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:20,470
you're hanging out on the giant thing. Uh, I want to participate. I don't want to just be

110
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,629
like a squirrel in your game. I got you the things. I got you the things. Did you, you need to get,

111
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:31,000
you dropped 50 bucks down there. We'll go get it. Hold on. Hold on. I want to be a

112
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,919
Warcraft critter in your fucking server. Just come here to the, come to the forge. My darling,

113
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,649
my darling. Why do I have a triple jump? Did I get that with being by being a squirrel?

114
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:53,980
You might have a cloud in a bottle. Oh yeah. Okay. So here's, here's the boots. Where are you

115
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:01,669
darling? I'm the squirrel in the room. Oh, you're the, okay. And here's my hat. So you put all those

116
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:08,149
on, you get an extra bonus. You'll be able to summon like 30 guys. Nice. Okay. I don't know

117
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:14,629
what the bonus is. Six defense over these three movement speed throwing damage. That's not bad.

118
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:24,740
All right. Let's put them on. So I can have max minions. Cool. All right. I'm gonna go get my 47

119
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:33,110
gold on table. So I can have two extra sons. Killing enemies or continually damaging bosses

120
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:39,159
generates soul wisps. After generating five wisps, they are instantly consumed to heal

121
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:46,629
you for 10 health. That's actually pretty great. That's really cool. All right. Nice. Let me go.

122
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:52,629
How many can I have? You said, let's see. I remember to touch the table. How do I, it's not

123
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:59,740
sons, it's summons. So your, your bird, I don't remember what you had the dank creeper perhaps.

124
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:11,659
How do I stop being squirrel? Okay. Thank you. All right. So let's see. No, this doesn't count as a

125
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:21,190
summon. No, that is a century. Oh, the boys that follow you. Damn it. Okay. What about these? Are

126
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,500
these some? All right. There we go. No, nevermind. You don't have two of those. That's just century

127
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:35,000
two. I'm century guy, not summon guy. Right? No. What are you doing? The clouds, dude, I'm going to

128
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,070
have to tell you something right now. I threw away the other ones. I don't think I have those

129
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:53,879
anymore. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. They're in here. He's being quiet. He's very

130
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,679
upset. Hold on. There we go. I'm thinking like, do I run back to town? Do I run back to our base and

131
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:07,160
hit him or do I get the gold? All right. So that's shadow drop staff is one of them. And then you can

132
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,720
only have one type of summon out at any point anyways, right? You can have more than one type.

133
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,759
Okay. So you, your, your pants, your armor and your helmet give a summon and you have one by

134
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,089
default. So you should be able to have four summons. Okay. Cool. And then you touch the

135
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:29,990
bewitching table and you get five. All right. So I definitely, um, I definitely threw away

136
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,940
some as a dog, dank creeper. Okay. Hold on. That's the good one. Oh, summons a dark or a rain from

137
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,960
the sky. No, no, no. That's not that fire is a story. Okay. That's the creeper. That's the one.

138
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:58,839
All right. Proud of you. All right. So let me go check it out. Let's see what it does.

139
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,200
It's like I can have three. Okay. That's pretty ridiculous. I can have three of these out at the

140
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:11,130
same time. Why am I so slow? It should give you five, five. It's not giving me five. It's three,

141
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:22,579
four with the table. Right. How do I activate it? Right. Click the table. Unless I just didn't read

142
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:28,420
the helmet. No, you didn't read it right. It's four with the table. Okay. All right. I'm ready to be

143
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:35,109
guy that just walks around and lets other things do everything for him. Um, well, wait, the owl

144
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:40,630
might be taking a summon slot. How do I, how do I get the owl to leap? The owl shouldn't be doing

145
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,990
that. It's a pet, which no, no, no, it's a highly doubt it. It's, it, the helmet is, uh, in its

146
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,910
helmets, minion damage, not summon minion. Okay. The two other pieces are extra minion. The helm

147
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:59,460
is 10% more damage. All right. So what are you, what are you at? Um, I'm grabbing the 47 gold that

148
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:12,579
I dropped. I'm going to go do that. I'm not paying attention chat. So as I was saying the last time,

149
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,779
last time we were playing, you were talking about how you wanted to like know more about

150
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:23,670
what you're doing. You said you're going to do some reading. Did you do any reading? Um,

151
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:35,339
so what would you like to do? I haven't had time. I haven't had time. All right. I would like to do

152
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:43,940
a boss. Okay. Here's, here's a couple of things that can be done. Um, you can actually change

153
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,140
the server to expert mode and bosses drop more things on expert mode that you can only get in

154
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:56,809
expert mode. And then we can kill bosses. We've already done. Um, I think there's two more bosses

155
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,210
for the mods that we can do. I have to double check which ones they are. I forget what we haven't

156
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:09,690
done. And we can do the wall of flesh, which is a big deal because after that, the game goes into

157
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:22,339
hard mode. Oh, okay. My guys can't get in here. I'm just kind of doing a little bit of exploring.

158
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,460
Okay. So none of those options. No, I just going to do a lot. All right. You pretty much just spoke

159
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,740
a different language for 30 straight seconds. Um, whatever you want to do, whatever you,

160
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,339
whatever you think would be the most interesting and more like most fun. You were talking about

161
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,380
like how you wanted to read up. You wanted to go in order. You wanted to make sure you weren't

162
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,130
doing anything and understand what we were doing. No, I know, I know what we're doing. What are we

163
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,529
doing? We're doing the wall of flesh. It's hard mode. It's like Diablo. You get, you, you, you

164
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:52,650
level up to a different, different quality. There's a couple of bosses before the wall of flesh that

165
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,609
we'll technically skip. If we do the wall of flesh, we can come back and do them later,

166
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:58,410
but we're probably never going to do that. So do you want to do those before we do the wall

167
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,730
of flesh? Sure. That sounds like fun. Okay. I need a second to check what we haven't done.

168
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:24,519
We didn't do the star scouter and we did not do slime. God slime. God is that what's the slime

169
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:30,470
God? Oh, because we never found the meteorite. I think we have to walk left and find the meteorite

170
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:38,410
and then we can do the star color thingy. Okay. Um, slime God is, it's just two big slimes at once,

171
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:46,950
but it drops some, some good stuff. Exploring caves is a lot more fun than just, uh, and more

172
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:57,900
productive than digging. Oh, okay. So, um, you don't think shaming you? No, they're saying that

173
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,900
don't like dig, go find a cave. Digging is like not productive to go like find stuff.

174
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,059
But what if you want it to dig? I thought you wanted to dig. You must have wanted to dig.

175
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,460
I don't know, but I'm putting a lot of torches down because I'm holding the shift.

176
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,500
That's because I'm holding shift to like do the thing where you can just automatically change to

177
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:33,819
what the hell was that? Give me these back. All right. There's a present out here. I love presents.

178
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:40,900
Okay. Uh, so we need to go, we need to go left. Yeah. I'm at the meteor. I'm mining meteorite

179
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,339
right now. That's what I'm doing. I'm just coming over here. You're at the meteor now.

180
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,410
Yeah. Let me touch, let me touch the thing. Oh, I got the little globes around me. I'm gonna get

181
00:22:50,410 --> 00:23:03,750
so confused. Can you buy? Yes. Dynamite before you come here. How much do you want? I don't know.

182
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:16,460
Like 20. Why don't you just open the present then? All right. You want 20 dynamite. Yeah.

183
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,950
There might even be some in the box. How does one sound?

184
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:35,259
How do I only have enough money for one? You can search in the box and see if there's gold.

185
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,819
Search for gold. Search for dynamite. Search for bombs. Bombs would be good enough.

186
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:48,099
Okay. There's no dynamite in here. Bomb. No bombs in here. No, I'm an idiot. I don't want

187
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:56,890
to filter weapons. Filter all. No dynamite. There are bombs in here though. I'm gonna buy

188
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:10,150
whatever I can buy with this. You wanted, guys, what's happening right now? 20 silver. Why can

189
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:18,279
it? Okay. All right. I got 11 dynamite and 12 bombs. Okay. You're going to want to,

190
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,240
you're going to want to come to me now. I'm on the way. And then you can participate. Good.

191
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:40,069
I love these things. This is so cool. Uh, where exactly did you, why'd you dig over here?

192
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,630
What? Stop asking me dumb questions. What's, what's, what's, what did you do over here?

193
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,160
Did we do this? I don't remember doing this. I can't see you. We're squad streaming. You can

194
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,319
see what I'm doing. You can just look at the squad window. That's why chat was telling you

195
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:13,269
it's not productive because like that's natural. It's just a hole. They exist. Uh, do you, do you,

196
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:16,230
how are you doing on Nana? You need like Nana stones? Whatever the hell these things are.

197
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:25,339
Uh, I think I still need like a few. Cause I have three. Wow. Someone's been holding out.

198
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:33,539
I like my little flare gun though. Like makes me able to see what I'm doing.

199
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:46,019
All right, buddy, boy. All right, let's go. This is meteor. This is the meteor. You don't

200
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,859
stand on the meteor because it burns you if you stand on it. Okay. So that's why you're going

201
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,500
to mine. So you just chuck some bombs down there. You want me just to start, just start throwing

202
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,740
dynamite down there and just throw a dynamite, you know, throw some bombs. The goal is to get

203
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,059
the meteorite as dynamite stands up in this game or does it fly? Okay. Some, some games dynamite

204
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:16,230
stands right up. Wait. Ow. What do you mean it stands up? They just don't like flat. Oh,

205
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,549
like you placed it on the ground. Yeah. I know. I thought you were insane, but I get it. How far,

206
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:26,309
how far down does this go? Uh, stop. You see like the brown rocks that are flaming. All right.

207
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:30,839
That's the meteor. I'm going to get it in there. See if I can get it in one. This is kind of like

208
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:38,309
a pinball game. Well, you see like you could just drop it over here now. Oops. I'm fine.

209
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Watch out.

210
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:54,009
What's a blast rate? I just told you I was throwing one. This is a lot. So what do you,

211
00:26:54,009 --> 00:27:01,420
do you like crap bars with? Yeah, we don't, we don't really need much more. How do we get it?

212
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,140
Also, we need to be, we need meteorite to summon the boss. Oh, okay. That we were going to do.

213
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:15,289
Do you want more than that? Or is that nothing? This will be enough. Why is that shooting at you?

214
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:26,470
I don't know. I think it's on drugs. Might be. Okay. So yeah, that's 300 meteorite. We're good.

215
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:38,859
We're good. Go back. Go back. What do I have? Let me look at my stuff. Sticky bomb. That's cool.

216
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:46,890
Sticky dynamite. It's combining dynamite with gel. So when you throw those things, that's cool.

217
00:27:47,529 --> 00:28:00,619
All right. I got a goodie bag. Also, I can wait. That hook. Oh, here. Take these. These won't break

218
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:12,170
if I throw them to you, right? The stars. All right. Oh, muscle talk. Do you want this ancient

219
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,009
shiv? 35 melee damage, 4% crit, very fast attack speed, average knockback material,

220
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:23,450
enemies release a blue aura cloud on death. No. Sell it. Sell it. Sell it. Who has the most money

221
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:33,829
in here? They all, they all just give you money. They don't have like a bank. Too much, too much

222
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:41,740
like fallout. All right. So on the left side for me is like default characters. I know pretty

223
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,380
much what all these do. You added like two expansions to this game and I don't know what

224
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:56,859
any of this is. Here's the important ones. Faye, the dryad, sells boss summon items generally for

225
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:05,500
bosses you've already beaten. Okay. So she helps. Cool. Paul. Paul's nobody. All right. Well, let's

226
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,019
summon them. And he doesn't have the things I was looking for. So you want to summon the boss?

227
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:26,009
Oh, this guy's boss is summons as well. We have to go up to the sky box. Like we can only summon

228
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:36,900
this boss up in the. Really? The tops. Yeah. I actually don't know how hard this boss is or what

229
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:50,890
it does. Oh, that's good to know. We're prepared. I know that we need platforms. We're going to need

230
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,410
to build platforms so we can actually move. Do you have enough wood for that or do we need to go get

231
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:04,490
it? I think it's in the box. All right. Well, I'll be up here. Okay. Hope you're having a good time.

232
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,059
Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a good day. I hope you had a really good drink.

233
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:17,180
A good drink. Yeah. Well, just like treat it yourself with a beverage. You know what I'm talking

234
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,579
about? Who's this person? Why is there like a lady up here? She had a lot of health.

235
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:43,420
Hag? Where the hell am I? Yes. You coming? Oh, it's because the gravity changed. Okay. That's cool.

236
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,680
My health. What's wrong with my health? Jerma hasn't activated squad stream. Oh, that's my bad.

237
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,079
I accepted the invite. Okay. I activated it. It's live now. Oh no, I did it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm

238
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:09,130
saying it's my fault. Did you not hear me? Dude, you got like such a cover because no matter what

239
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,769
happens, if something wrong goes, if something goes wrong, it's you could always be like, well,

240
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:20,089
Jerma is a stupid idiot. You have, you have like such insurance when you like do anything with me,

241
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:24,170
it seems. And you know, if I wouldn't have that, if you had a little bit more confidence,

242
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,019
a little bit of self-respect and you can be like, no, you can literally throw a baseball through

243
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:38,579
your window right now. And it would just be like, Jerma, you fucking left the thing over here. You

244
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,579
left the window unlocked and you were cleaning the window and it dropped and people would believe

245
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:54,819
you. And it'd be like, what did I do? I didn't do anything. True. I said, how big does this

246
00:31:54,819 --> 00:32:00,279
platform have to be? I'm just doing it. One, one, one, just protect me. Summon your sentry thing.

247
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:07,079
They're everywhere. No, you're fucking auto shoot sun. Oh, you mean this thing? Yeah. Don't forget

248
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:24,119
you have a sun. See, this is all your fucking fault. Oh, fuck man. Like I brought my car in to get

249
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:31,420
repaired and I need a, I need like a new gasket. Jerma, like what the fuck, man? Like you should

250
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:38,490
have been in the server faster. What happened? I, I stupid man. Usually I just blame Ronnie.

251
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:45,369
This guy is so like oblivious and selfish that he made me buy like seven different cables to

252
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:50,170
fix a computer problem. Like I trusted him and he took advantage of me and I ended up buying like

253
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:59,660
seven cables. Wait, what? Okay. I'm summoning a boss. All right. Where are you going to summon it?

254
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:10,519
And where I am, you just summon it and then it comes to you. I'm getting my ass kicked. I'm worried.

255
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:28,359
Do I? This shit shooting us from underneath. Whoa. Okay. I don't know what it does.

256
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,529
What are you doing? What's this? How do I do this? Oh my God. Okay. You're going to jump over that

257
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:43,339
apparently. Why is he focusing on me? You know, like honestly, you're probably dealing so much

258
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:52,599
more damage than me. Oh, I'm speaking of dying. If you're, you can use your mirror, go back to town.

259
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:07,190
I picked up my stupid pickaxe. Where the, oh my God. Where the fuck is our healer? Do we,

260
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:21,820
oh, she's right there. How do I, how do I respawn? Oh, that didn't go so well. Is it, is he dead?

261
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:36,579
He might've left. No, wait. Hold on. Oh, respawn time. What's your max health? 160. Yeah. We're

262
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:50,090
pretty low. We should be a lot higher right now. How much higher do we need to be? Uh, we could be

263
00:34:50,090 --> 00:35:00,039
at 300. Oh, that sounds pretty important. Yeah, it does. Should I wait for you? It still shows

264
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:11,159
his health bar. So I don't. Is he just hanging out up here? He shouldn't be. Yeah. I don't know.

265
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:24,579
Let's go find, uh, health. How about that? Is that? No. Uh. Why, why, what's with the,

266
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:34,150
what's the, why this topaz? Give me that. Uh. So are we just gonna go get health? Yeah. Hold on.

267
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,889
Why is everybody vote kicking me? Didn't you hear what Star said? I was the one doing the damage.

268
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:47,239
Who's the birthday person? Is this, I'm just breaking this guy's house and taking his stuff.

269
00:35:47,880 --> 00:36:18,139
He doesn't care. What happened? Star. Star. It's boss.

270
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,920
Oh no, he's by chest hurts right now. Seriously. What the fuck?

271
00:36:31,449 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm just going to. Tyler doesn't give a shit. I don't know what I did, but he's raining fire

272
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:12,090
down. Oh shit. It's the fucking prophecy. He's not going to kill him. He's going to kill everybody.

273
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:21,429
He just goes killed. No man. Why are you not reacting to this? I feel like you would be

274
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:28,809
fucking freaking out right now. Are we in the same game? Am I muted? Yes. You've been muted.

275
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:36,679
I think I was muted. Oh yeah. I, whoops. All right. Calvin has one sliver of health. He's

276
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:42,739
going to die. Yeah. I was trying to give some advice and some tips and some, some technique.

277
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:46,900
Maybe. What happened? He, I just was, I was breaking some into somebody's house and he

278
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:54,699
just spawned on me. Well, let's, that's what's weird is he still has a health bar. All right.

279
00:37:54,699 --> 00:38:03,750
So he's, he's somewhere. All right. Let's go find him. He's just like appears. This is so scary.

280
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:12,389
It's like, um, I feel like it's fucking Mr. X by the way, did you play the new resident evil

281
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,699
two remake? Uh, I watched a lot of it and played it. That's probably one of the best games of the

282
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:32,969
year. Oh shit. You mean it's one of the best games of 10 years ago? Well, yeah. Because

283
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:38,489
Capcom hit a hard spot and couldn't, couldn't make new games anymore. So the new strat is just to

284
00:38:38,489 --> 00:39:02,739
make old stuff again. He's on me. I'm dead. I was going to teleport and I didn't. I'm, I'm,

285
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:08,860
I'm a ghetto. He's just juggling me right now. I'm dead. Why don't you just kill it,

286
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,820
Jerma? Come on. Fuck dude. You're the strong one. I'm the one doing the armor. You got the

287
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,619
summons. You have the sentry. You have all the good stuff. You take all the fucking good gear.

288
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:24,090
He just juggled me. He just juggled me. He did. He just juggled me in the air. We're not, hey,

289
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:30,570
don't even give me this kind of shit. You've got like a guy on training wheels here and where like

290
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:36,570
a hundred percent less health than we would need to be. And you just, you, all right. Yeah. I don't

291
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,849
know. You just put me in armor. You have better attack damage because you have all the summons.

292
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:49,719
I've given you everything. You can't, all right. You can't put like a toddler in fucking like gold

293
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:59,269
armor, give him a sword and say, all right, I gave you all this really cool stuff. You're like,

294
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:03,590
really? Look at how you look at how shiny that armor is. Why have you not killed the other king

295
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:18,409
yet? What? But can't you? Toddler screaming. Yeah. In the game, in the game. I still am like,

296
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:24,570
just like a baby in this game. Okay. Well, the boss is somewhere with like 7% health. Just say

297
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:36,230
sliver. It's like a cooler, like more like cooler vocabulary. He's, he's one. He's one. He's lit.

298
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:47,980
Where is he? Is he right there? Is that him? What is that? I'm afraid to do anything right now.

299
00:40:48,619 --> 00:41:09,260
No, it's gold. Only it shows bosses on the map, but he's not. What if he was like all the way over

300
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:18,679
here? I don't, I don't see him. All right. Can I go back and like open the chest that I was going

301
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:25,289
to open at this guy's house? All right. It's already open. There's like nothing in it. So yeah, go,

302
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:33,670
go ahead and do your stupid thing. Does he leave when there's a party going on? No, maybe he doesn't

303
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:43,429
know. Okay. He's by me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. He hates me. Uh, don't die. Don't die.

304
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:51,860
Give me like two seconds. I'm trying. Tell me if you're going to die. Oh, it's going to be close.

305
00:41:52,659 --> 00:42:04,280
Oh, it's going to be close. He's dead. Okay. What'd you get? Uh, I got broken star trail healing

306
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:21,050
potion and broken star trail. It's a weapon, a snake banner, vanquisher metal. That's nothing.

307
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:41,739
It's broken. So that means it's bad. It's terrible stats. Let me see. Where are you? Here. What was

308
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:51,780
that? I don't know. What's going on? Oh, I want to see. I want to see. Uh, yes, I drew it. What else did

309
00:42:51,780 --> 00:43:04,980
he drop? Something else too. Where is it? Oh, dude. Graviton surge. Oh, quick sort. Sort of. Yeah,

310
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:13,139
there we go. Okay. Okay. Well, that was intense. There's a guy that resets the stats on an item.

311
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:18,739
I don't know if we ever got them. That was fun. It was apparently we don't have enough houses.

312
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,840
Can I, um, my hand's up in the back. I'm like raising my hand up. Yeah. And you call. Okay.

313
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,800
Thank you. Uh, can we get more health so we don't have to, uh, like be, uh, nerfed the whole time

314
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:40,949
we played again? Um, I would, I would like that. Yeah. Who the fuck is this guy? We just have to

315
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:47,530
go explore to find the health, right? Yeah. Random parts under the ground. Random parts on the ground.

316
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:53,130
You got it. I'm going. Uh, if you take our giant tunnel and go down and then go to the right,

317
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,050
because I don't think we explored the right. What? Oh my God. I thought I had an extra, like,

318
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,889
I was going to jump. I was going to do the double jump, but like his platform was here.

319
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:13,300
I didn't know. I was going to just wait till, you know, jump before you hit the ground. I didn't

320
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:21,579
know. I, your platform just killed me. Oh, good joke. He wasn't a joke. In fact, destroyed fucking

321
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:31,590
evidence. Oh, uh, good joke. Okay. Let me, I gotta store some shit before we do anything.

322
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:43,590
Oh, the Calvin's respawning health. Nice. All right. Let me deposit this stuff.

323
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:53,900
Okay. Okay. Now what do I want with me? Oh, definitely like 7,000 torches. Hey,

324
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:08,170
where the fuck did the guy go? Did they leave? Did they get invaded yet? Spoilers. I don't want

325
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:19,019
to see spoilers. That can't even happen. We're in normal mode. Can't even happen. We're in normal.

326
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:24,460
Wait, like eight more hours of us playing together. That's actually our first blood moon.

327
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:30,889
What do you mean? What are we talking about? What? What does the blood moon do? What's that mean?

328
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:39,239
It means they're going to start attacking. Did I just say we haven't been invaded yet? And then

329
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:47,000
did I do that? Well, no, being invaded is like dark souls. Oh, that's where like 16 players show

330
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,409
up in your game and gank you. Is that really what happens? No, there is an alien invasion.

331
00:45:55,539 --> 00:46:02,340
I assume is what they meant. Okay. So do we do this to defend the house?

332
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,730
Yeah, if you want to. We, they drop a special item, blood droplets, and we need a few of them

333
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:22,619
because we've never had a blood moon before, as far as I remember. Honestly, if you just stay in

334
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,860
the house, they all come to the door and your summons stay outside and they'll probably kill

335
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:42,780
everything. Oh, cool. The door. Ah, the door. They are coming. All right. I got left side,

336
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:56,869
you get right side. Oh, this makes you feel like a necromancer. I thought that was you. Wow.

337
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:03,340
Who's got the glasses? So yeah, like, yeah, we still don't have the freaking,

338
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,699
the guy that like we are missing so many NPCs. I do not want to build houses for another hour.

339
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:17,019
Or like we should go to hell and just make a whole bunch of rooms for all these idiots.

340
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:30,980
We're going to put these people in hell. That sounds kind of mean. Now go on collection. All

341
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:41,769
right. What or I'm going to go up the dreaded patchwork patchwork. There's a mini boss on my

342
00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:46,889
side. Oh, honestly, the blood moon. This should have happened to us like

343
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:55,610
years ago. This is all kind of irrelevant. Sorry, I've been really bad in muting my sneezes,

344
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,610
but I figured I'm going to let me be honest with you. If I muted my stream and sneezed,

345
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:04,090
it would still show up on your stream. So if I meet, I would have like, I would have fucking

346
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:15,260
like you need an actual, you know, come on, be a professional. I would have just panicked

347
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,380
and pressed a bunch of buttons and probably like restarted my computer accidentally.

348
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:25,829
Anything would be better than listening to your bodily fluids like eject from your face.

349
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,780
You disgust me.

350
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,860
No. All right. So we're going to go down and this is the hole underneath the

351
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,659
house eventually or the one that like to the right all the way to the right.

352
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:58,059
Oh shit. We need a minotaur. So this would be good for you. How can you let stuff in here?

353
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:07,659
I don't know. I don't know. Did you even like clean this up for you? What?

354
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:16,070
You let the shit in. Why do you have the door open? You're supposed to be the terraria master.

355
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:25,340
What? Oh, because these guys are chumps. How long does the blood moon last? All night. All

356
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:35,210
night. All night. I'm getting lots of money and stuff. I need to find the goblin guy.

357
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,329
I need to make rooms. Germa here, here, here, here's what you're going to have.

358
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:45,530
What? I knew my save minutes were skulls. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on.

359
00:49:49,880 --> 00:50:03,539
Okay. Everyone get high. Can I see some drama hypes in the chat? I don't want to see it.

360
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:10,550
Wait, is this? Wait, what? I just picked up so many. There's so much shit out here. What?

361
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:16,500
I don't know what this stuff even is. I'm just a vacuum cleaner. Severed hand, blood orb. All

362
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,900
right. I've never seen this before. Duh. Okay. Try this item. It's, um, you know that, that

363
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,739
Undertale game? It looks like every character in that game. Undertale. A skull I just dropped down

364
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:33,780
here. Have you ever played Undertale? No. Unpleasant, strange skull. Yeah. It deals

365
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:40,500
summon damage, but it looks like an actual spell. Um, you meant to say that's, that's, that's just,

366
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,420
no, no, no. You're talking about one character in Undertale that everybody says that stands,

367
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:50,099
right? Okay. That's fine. Like the only character. No, no. It's like, yeah. Have you ever played that

368
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:59,849
game? Did you leave this door open? I did. All right. What the fuck does this do? 45 plus one

369
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:05,500
summon damage. Summons a ghastly skull to shoot laser beams, which cause damage over time.

370
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:19,929
And I, yeah, I don't know really what that means. Once this is, uh, you're having a bad time.

371
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:32,380
Kill death. What? I just got an achievement. What does kill death? Dude, I don't, I don't know.

372
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,260
Ronnie would like to watch your broadcast. A request from steam.

373
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:52,199
What is that even that, that, that can't actually be you, Ronnie. I want to watch you play on steam,

374
00:51:52,199 --> 00:52:01,559
please. That's funny. Oh my God. You're so needy. I want a higher quality version. I forgive you.

375
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,989
That's a very good joke. That's fine. Cause I talked shit about the cables and then like ignored

376
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:14,409
chat and you probably said something. They had to like wallow in pity. Okay. Um, I feel like we've

377
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:19,530
been collecting. So no, we're good. We're good. We're good. Go underground and just look for the

378
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:27,449
hearts. But let me deposit shit. Also, uh, it might be worth it to use a splunker potion because you

379
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:33,289
can see the hearts through walls. Like everything lights up. Okay. Yeah. So if you get, don't use

380
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:38,170
like one potion on this. Do not use more than one potion. I'm going to fucking scream. Don't use

381
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:44,969
more than one spelunk potion. Spelunker. You ever played spelunky? You know, spelunky two. I have

382
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,969
played spelunky and I was like, yeah, this is, this is fun, but I didn't really do much in it.

383
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:56,389
All right. What am I doing with spelunk? I can't say the half of that word. Just one. You said,

384
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:02,949
yeah, it lasts for five minutes. Use it when you go underground. How do I take just one thing out

385
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:10,550
of the closet box? I don't know. Just take, I don't know. Oh, I got one. Okay. All right. Use,

386
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:16,230
just use it when we go underground and then look for hearts. Yeah. Just run around. You'll like zoom

387
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:23,420
out all the way to, don't be a boomer. Put your glasses on. No, I'm not going to do that. Zoom out

388
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,739
and then you'll be able to see the heart. I can't do that. And you can collect them really quickly.

389
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:46,949
Use the skull. What the hell? Is that better than this? Better than what?

390
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:54,489
That's, I think it might be better than what I was using before for like my main.

391
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:01,739
I based like what I like on about, on sounds though. I'm not sure if I don't like that sound.

392
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:06,809
Oh, you don't like the sound. All right. So you said go down underneath our base and just start

393
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:17,590
looking for hearts. Yeah. I'm going, I'm going for it. I apologize, but you do not like the sound

394
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:34,309
though. How far zoomed he is, is unreal genre. He better zoom out. What I can't, what I, I can't see.

395
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:45,530
I'm not doing it. If you waste the spelunker potion, I'm going to be mad.

396
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,329
Like if you end the spelunker potion and you're like, okay, I got one heart.

397
00:54:52,119 --> 00:55:02,500
I'm not, I'm at 139%. Remember that. Oh, oh gross. I hate it. All right. I'm taking spelunker

398
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:09,289
potion now. Aren't you the same person who, who is like one of the only people that agrees with me

399
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:14,889
that path of exile, like makes you vomit because of how close you are to the screen.

400
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:20,809
Yes. I, I, but that's different. That's top down. How was that different? Top down view

401
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:30,280
and it's 3d. All right. What, will the hearts just be hearts or is it like in a box or something?

402
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:37,159
Big red heart crystals. Okay. There is also life ports, which will be like blocks that have hearts

403
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:49,190
in them. This is cool though. You can do this. Five minutes of this. That's not that much. We

404
00:55:49,190 --> 00:56:06,150
can just tell a funny story. What? Dude, I want to hit you. Get out of here. All right.

405
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:14,869
I need to go home. Why did you just do the batman? I have one question.

406
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:31,400
Batman, the beer. I can't hear the original beer. You know, I'm telling you if you only

407
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,840
find one of these, dude, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest. I see it. I swear

408
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:51,849
fucking good. Let me ask you one question. Superman go. I don't even know. Superman.

409
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:59,420
Why would Superman be in the same universe? I know, right? Like who even figured that out?

410
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:18,250
We got cool stuff over here. Okay. So it's chest. I don't see any heart though. What is this thing?

411
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:29,659
It's like a person's house. Okay. Uh, arcane band, bomb, shuriken,

412
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:37,739
swift, miss potion, recall potion, and some torches. All right. Very cool. Very cool. And water.

413
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:59,059
Water. I found one. Shoot him. Dude, you know what we really need right now is a freaking

414
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:05,940
poon hammer. What the fuck are you talking about? Is that really loud? Did I peek the mic on that?

415
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:11,369
Oh, if you want to hear a mic being peaked, I got it. Don't fucking do it. Like everybody hates

416
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:26,519
that. Nobody likes that. All right. I got it. Life crystal. So just take it, right? Yeah. And

417
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:35,269
it's a 20 HP. Cool. Now this is the part of the game that I was talking about. That's the part

418
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:41,289
again that I wanted to see. You're like about spawning bosses and going and picking up meteors.

419
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:45,210
I wanted to go look. You're doing it. It's dude. It's the problem is that I've had to hold your

420
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:51,369
hand at every step. It's the part of the game you want to see is exploring and fucking go do it.

421
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:56,889
Every time I go do it, you go, Oh boy, I need a demon, demon, uh, Titan or hold on.

422
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,719
I have been very respectful of you. I've been patient. I haven't. Not at all. Everyone was

423
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:09,719
like, man, stars, like really like fucking trying to rush him. I don't like it.

424
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:16,039
And I kept muting last stream going like, I know, what the fuck? I don't know what to do.

425
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:33,739
Like, what the fuck? No, that's not how that happened. What do we got in here? Have you found

426
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:44,039
one? I'm not looking. Wait, you're the one with the potion. We don't both have the potion. Why

427
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,039
didn't you take one and do this? There's nothing in this chest. How the fuck is that possible?

428
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:55,750
So are we splitting these? Just keep using them.

429
00:59:56,389 --> 01:00:13,579
What is it? 180. All right. You have max health right now? Yeah. I might have spunky potion right

430
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:30,739
now. Can you deliver one? Can I, can I Uber Eats a spunky potion? I don't even need it. I'll find

431
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:59,980
one. Okay. Not bad. What is that? What is this thing? What was that? A dragon? Hey, I just

432
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:12,860
killed the dragon down here. He dropped a starfish. Good job. Good job, buddy.

433
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:29,289
Ooh, what's this? Chest. How can I, how can I have? Did something happen here? Why can only have two

434
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:43,480
of these? It was three before. Am I missing something here? Does it say they count as two

435
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:50,440
on the staff? No, no, no, no, no, no. Because your bewitching table probably just wore off.

436
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,440
Cool. Recall potion. I got some recall potions though we can share. You don't share them. You

437
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:12,300
have the mirror. Oh, I thought that, no, doesn't not wormhole. All right. Sword items. Wait.

438
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:30,920
I'll figure this out later. I don't really like this thing. It might pick up at bosses,

439
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,239
but it takes like kind of too long and it can't shoot through walls.

440
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:45,719
Hold on. I'm getting to like the water here. Water. I'm kind of concerned about this.

441
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:53,579
What is that? What's a giant clam? Giant clam down here.

442
01:02:54,679 --> 01:03:09,750
I found the giant clam star. Come to me. Where is he? What do you want? I was busy

443
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:17,340
blittling my chat. I got a giant clam here. There's a giant clam boss. Oh, okay. I'm coming.

444
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:27,139
I don't know where it is. It's here somewhere. Um, we're going to have to go underwater and we like

445
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:33,579
can't breathe underwater. It's a shitty ball, like easy to kill for us. Yeah. But still we can't

446
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:39,159
breathe underwater and now I'm wasting my. Oh, it's right here. Yeah. What are you talking about?

447
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,460
Oh shit. He's right here.

448
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:51,019
Dead. Okay. Yeah. It's like one of the first bosses you're supposed to kill,

449
01:03:51,019 --> 01:04:01,260
but he makes an NPC summon. Oh, okay. Well, that thing was really stupid. All right. Let

450
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:08,199
me see if I can find another heart. Ami, Amidius, Amidius, the sea king. What does that guy do?

451
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:17,980
Anything cool? The NPC. Yeah, there's a guy down there now. Yeah, he sells, uh, he sells weapons.

452
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:31,079
Are they good? They're okay. I think we're a little bit past them now. I just need like another heart.

453
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:41,510
How many do you need? What's the max health? The max is 300. I need like five of them then.

454
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:46,230
Have you just been taking them? I have two. All right. That should be fine.

455
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,099
No, we have to get you to 300 because then there's like a,

456
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:59,099
just, just, we're getting you to 300. Don't, don't give up. Okay. I'm going to run out of

457
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:07,719
like inventory space. How many do you need? What are you at? I'm at 180.

458
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:15,480
Yeah, I'm telling you, you've been eating these and like you, you just been eating all the lunch.

459
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,679
You're also not very good at finding them. I've got three already.

460
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:22,329
I had the Spelunky potion and there was only one over here.

461
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,289
Well, you gotta, you gotta go quickly through the ground, cover the most ground, zoom out.

462
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:37,260
I'm zoomed out. About 400 is max, by the way. I, I, it was gonna preemptively warn you to not

463
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,739
listen to your chat on this shit, Jerma, but you're falling for it. They think they're smart. They

464
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:46,059
think they know what they're talking about and they're going to backseat you. They angst me at

465
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:51,500
the 400, but you need to just like fucking smack them and keep them in line. Tell them you're the

466
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:59,380
streamer and to trust you. Can you do that? Why would I ever strike somebody in my chair?

467
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:11,050
That's fucking uncalled for. That's the only way some people learn. What the fuck is a rude

468
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:20,150
elemental? It's really mean. It's kind of like what I'm doing right now. Is there one above me?

469
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:33,320
These guys are really distracting. They're like just screaming in my ear, it seems. Hold on,

470
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:46,539
just despawn them? Yeah, but what if I get attacked and I need them?

471
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:54,170
Jerma, you don't need anybody. Is there nothing up here? There's nothing. You're a star all on

472
01:06:54,170 --> 01:07:00,940
your own. You don't need these people. Uh, there's another giant clam. Ignore him.

473
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:12,730
There's a chest here. Um, there's a worm in here too, apparently. What is this?

474
01:07:15,579 --> 01:07:25,940
Cloud in a bottle. Stop. What the fuck? Wait, what? You motherfucker. Really? What are you doing here?

475
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,980
Get away from me. Okay, I've got four hearts for you.

476
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:48,380
Dude. Okay, this is what we call unfair. He's dead, but I don't want to- that's bullshit.

477
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:59,639
I'm eating this fucking hamburger. What the fuck else is even else in here?

478
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:10,340
Giant pearl. I don't have an inventory space. Where are my summons? Summon them. Then

479
01:08:11,139 --> 01:08:16,500
it doesn't want to give them to me anymore. They might be stuck somewhere else so you can

480
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:28,340
unsummon them by the stat underneath your bar door. Mud blocks. I have like mud.

481
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:35,720
That's funny to you. It's kind of funny because like I don't want this stuff.

482
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:50,890
Have you been auto trashing things? No. Get on it. Rope. I don't have any rope. Dangerous potion.

483
01:08:53,449 --> 01:09:05,850
I swear I had a- hold on. I swear I had a shadow key. My god, how do I just delete an item?

484
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:13,539
How do you just delete an item? You drag it to the bottom right of your inventory. What the fuck?

485
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:29,850
Oh my god. There was a door in there. Okay, Jerma, I don't know what you're on about,

486
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,090
but here you can have- The trash in the lower right,

487
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:42,359
you said. I'm putting it and it just like takes up the space. What? Why? Oh my god. No,

488
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:48,520
it doesn't. Why does it just not just disappear? It's the last thing you delete it in case you

489
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,359
want to take it out. Oh god damn it. I was saying- The one to the left of that is auto

490
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:57,800
delete and everything you put on that list the moment you pick it up at auto trash.

491
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:02,359
Because I'm sitting there going like why is this like taking up an inventory space now?

492
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:11,659
Hello. Here's four life crystals. Don't delete them. Also, here's an item that you will enjoy.

493
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,369
You know, try that that hasty necromancer's heart out a little bit.

494
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:27,000
Just laughing. Just laughing. Just laugh it up. Don't drown in your bath tonight. Get some water

495
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,590
wings. It was like two feet of water. I know. That's why I thought it was safe. Look, there's

496
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:44,199
a lot going on there, okay? What did I just- I have a full inventory. Get rid of this. Everybody,

497
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:51,399
we're real worried about you. I'm fine. Relax. You didn't tell me that I had to do that.

498
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:56,500
I did. It was one of the very first things I explained. And that was also a week and a half

499
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:05,260
ago. I thought that you would have a memory of a week. Oh yeah? Well, how come you didn't know how

500
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,300
to turn the server on correctly this week? What was it? I distinctly remember you saying,

501
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,460
I forgot how we did this last week. That's a distinct thing that I heard last week. Is that

502
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:23,640
not true? I don't think that happened. Hey, is the server working? You ain't gonna fucking fool me.

503
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:34,390
All right, slowly. Let me- 20 minutes. That's way better than this. All right, so the cloud in a

504
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:43,510
bottle. Yeah. So there's like different versions of that cloud. Fleeting cloud. Intrepid cloud.

505
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:48,949
When it says that, that's the stat associated with it. Or it'll be like plus three move speed

506
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:53,590
or something random on it. And you can re-roll that stat. Do you want this one that has- But

507
01:11:53,590 --> 01:12:02,260
we don't have that melee speed? No. So should I just dump it somewhere? You can probably just

508
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:08,329
sell it. All right, well what is this? What am I doing? Release bees, win damage. That's good.

509
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:13,060
After taking damage, let me deal damage to all nearby nodes. That's all right. This one's not

510
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:22,229
that great though. Yeah, that one's not that- I mean, you take a lot of damage. Can you go over

511
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:30,039
max mana? Yes. Items will go over max mana. Okay. Yeah, just I'm making sure. So max mana is just

512
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:34,359
how many stars you can use. And then there's some items later on that'll give you like a hundred

513
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:48,010
plus max mana. Right. Okay, that's cool. Should I pick up anything else? Let me see this. Fashions

514
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:53,289
mana powered armor. So that I'm assuming this, I can take hits with my mana bar instead of my health

515
01:12:53,289 --> 01:13:00,789
bar. I'm assuming. Yeah. Dwyane's effect. That's actually really good. Sometimes I don't know if

516
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:06,710
you're asking me a question, your chat a question, or yourself. All at the same time. Because I feel

517
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:13,189
like- I feel like I'm falling for a trap if I answer you. No. Like he's going to figure this

518
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:21,819
out himself in like two seconds, right? But it's rude to ignore you. No, I'm just talking. I just-

519
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:34,699
What? You don't like talk out loud? Only works if you have no armor or vanity armor equipped. Well,

520
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:38,779
that's kind of- Oh, that item is not good. Yeah, I was gonna say that was gonna be some.

521
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:51,020
Necromancer's Heart. Max number of centuries by one. Decreases your life regen. Oh, shit.

522
01:13:52,310 --> 01:14:00,470
It's worth it. Oh, but okay. What is this? A helmet? It's an accessory. Oh, shit. Okay.

523
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:07,460
Okay. It's a necromancer's heart. Do I put this on my head?

524
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:15,739
Stick it on. Is this a hat? I don't know if it's like a chest piece. You know how games are.

525
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,020
Yeah. That rune of bleeding. I know how games are. I'm gonna switch out the rune of bleeding.

526
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:35,369
Because I like this one. I like the double jump. What is making that loud ass noise over here?

527
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:43,100
That's a little bit of a rumor. All right. So, what do you want to know? That we have some health?

528
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:50,220
You need to get to 300 health. I need to have 300. Okay. You are not allowed to do anything

529
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:55,579
else until you get there. Okay. I'm not allowed to do anything else. Okay. I'm running

530
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:05,050
an associated errand. Okay. I'm gonna go- Do you care if I take another Spelunky potion?

531
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:11,819
Or will you be mad at me for that? You know, I'll accept it. I accept

532
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:16,060
that this is the way things are just gonna have to be. And then when we kill Plantera

533
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,739
and we don't have any freaking Spelunky potions, I'll just know who to blame.

534
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,479
Okay. So, don't take one. Is that what you're saying?

535
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:32,819
No. Go ahead. Just do whatever you want. It's what you normally do anyway.

536
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:36,789
There's none even in here. Oh, yeah. I took them.

537
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:40,550
Oh. Was that your insurance policy to make sure I could have taken them?

538
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:43,670
Oh, no. Because I used one to help you find them. And I got you four.

539
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,550
And you got one. I was just, you know, just trying to help.

540
01:15:54,819 --> 01:16:03,449
I'm gonna bring the bombs down with me. I'm gonna start blowing stuff up down there.

541
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:21,590
I don't- All right. It's time to go on an explosion spree.

542
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:31,670
Three, four. All right. And I can have one, two. That's insane. That's awesome. Cool.

543
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:38,619
All right. I'm gonna go down. Just pick a spot and just go down.

544
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:45,020
I might even pass you. I would say hello on the way down.

545
01:16:47,779 --> 01:17:02,789
No. No, kid. Your aeon's behind me. You're like a roach to me.

546
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:14,579
All right. I don't think I'm gonna go down this far. I'm gonna go over here.

547
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:19,300
I mean, as long as there's an easy path to just run along quickly is all you need.

548
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,869
I guess I'm just gonna go right now. Also, if you went to the jungle,

549
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:25,829
there is usually a lot in the jungle and the jungle is pretty open.

550
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:29,510
The jungle? I probably already used the potion, so it's-

551
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:32,789
I did not use any potion. I don't have any potions. You took them all.

552
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:38,550
I'm gonna go up. Don't go as far down as, like, the water?

553
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:47,430
Here. Do this. Go back up to the surface and then keep walking left until you get to the jungle.

554
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:50,149
It'll be the area that's jungly and green and muddy.

555
01:17:53,619 --> 01:17:57,539
And you should pretty easily be able to find some in there. If not, some chests and other stuff

556
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,579
because we haven't been in the dungeon at all or in the jungle at all.

557
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:21,609
On my way. Look at this guy. I don't think I'm gonna get a lot of use out of that.

558
01:18:21,609 --> 01:18:24,649
All right. There's a way we can- This looks kind of jungly, doesn't it?

559
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:35,880
This is not the jungle? I guess not.

560
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:47,350
Jerm's gonna hate the jungle, I feel. Why do you feel that?

561
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:21,239
This is desert. I think I'm getting close. Did you open this chest already?

562
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:34,569
I mean, I'm at the meteor. There's nothing even down over here.

563
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:44,229
Meteor head and keep going left.

564
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:49,100
Past the meteor. Past the meteor.

565
01:19:49,100 --> 01:20:01,479
Okay. Ouch! I was prepared for that jump.

566
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,909
Ouch! I see what you're doing there.

567
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:08,229
All right. Then up this hill, there's the giant hole.

568
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:09,750
And just keep going down the giant hole.

569
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:14,470
And this does look like a jungle.

570
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:25,609
All right. I am at a hole that's in the ground. Is that the one you're talking about?

571
01:20:25,609 --> 01:20:26,890
This big one that's down here? Yep.

572
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,569
All right. Yep.

573
01:20:28,569 --> 01:20:29,930
Let's go get some hearts.

574
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:32,890
Stand back. I'm gonna throw bombs everywhere.

575
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,899
These are not as strong as I thought they were gonna be.

576
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:01,260
They're actually very weak, but it's okay. I have a lot of them.

577
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:25,800
Okay. Nothing yet. Is that gonna hit me?

578
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,439
No. Yes. Watch out.

579
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:33,640
It's not gonna hit me. All right. Spot.

580
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:50,579
Let's take a look. Oops. Oops.

581
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,380
Oopsies. No. Even better.

582
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:59,779
All right. I think there's something right here.

583
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:08,420
Pretty cool. Found a little cave system.

584
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:33,739
All right. Keeps going down.

585
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,619
There's no internet in the jungle.

586
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:42,090
All right. Hold on a minute here.

587
01:22:44,819 --> 01:22:46,260
I ain't gonna fucking screw around.

588
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:52,600
All right. It's safe.

589
01:22:53,720 --> 01:23:01,079
Moon glow? Just bomb it.

590
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:13,720
Did you say you were gonna teleport to me?

591
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:20,439
Soon. I'm trying to get you the thing that you need to have after you've

592
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:21,720
finished getting life crystals.

593
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,359
Ooh. Yellow slug. Okay. This is something down here.

594
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:27,960
All right. I got one.

595
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,399
I'm planning for your future.

596
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:35,909
I found one. Life crystal.

597
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,229
And spiked anklet of the wind.

598
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:47,619
10% increased movement speed and plus 2% damage.

599
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:50,779
That seems pretty great.

600
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,100
And it combines with something else, I think, to make like lightning boots or something.

601
01:23:55,100 --> 01:24:01,619
Damn. Artery potion. Recall potion.

602
01:24:04,329 --> 01:24:05,689
And a honey dispenser.

603
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:13,939
Oh, nice. Okay.

604
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:17,800
What about this thing? Green torch.

605
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,079
I want that.

606
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,670
Oh, all right. I need...

607
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,239
I need one more heart.

608
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,720
So don't even use the potion.

609
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,680
There's no reason to do that.

610
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,590
Okay. I mean, I'm gonna...

611
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,390
I just need one more.

612
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:48,500
Okay. No, I'm not gonna drown in here.

613
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,760
Oh. I'm gonna make sure of that.

614
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,800
What? What's wrong?

615
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,420
What? Nothing.

616
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,340
It's fine. Everything's fine.

617
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,100
It was almost bad, but it's fine.

618
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:09,140
I want to get in there.

619
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:11,180
I feel like I'm...

620
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,140
I feel like I'll drown in there.

621
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:12,939
I think I really might.

622
01:25:12,939 --> 01:25:13,659
Club tornado?

623
01:25:14,539 --> 01:25:16,180
Tornado.

624
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,739
All right. No, I'm gonna go this way.

625
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,420
I feel like that's underwater. I don't like that.

626
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:27,079
Dude, just bomb everything.

627
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:27,800
That's what I'm doing.

628
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,260
Nice.

629
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:37,850
Didn't I have more bombs than that?

630
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:42,489
I thought I had more bombs than that.

631
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:44,979
I guess I used them all.

632
01:25:47,239 --> 01:25:47,800
Time to dig.

633
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,760
You did use a bit.

634
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:58,840
Get the fish. Fish. Fish.

635
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:02,149
Do I? No, I don't.

636
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:03,029
I don't have to get the fish.

637
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:11,130
All right. This...

638
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:12,649
Hold on a minute here.

639
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:16,659
It's safe.

640
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,579
Ooh. I can go that way.

641
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:22,920
What's this way?

642
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,020
So much to learn.

643
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,550
You killed a hellbat.

644
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,109
Good for you.

645
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:44,939
I don't think there's anything up there.

646
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:45,500
I'll go down here.

647
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:57,699
Mud block, right?

648
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,949
The mud block is gonna be auto-deleted

649
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:04,229
when it's in that right slot, right?

650
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:05,689
Yeah.

651
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,350
Left slot.

652
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,149
The left slot.

653
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:11,210
The left slot is your list of...

654
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:13,859
Enable auto-trash.

655
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:14,899
I mean, it's on the right

656
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:16,180
but the left one on the right.

657
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:21,739
How do I put something in there?

658
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:23,739
Enable auto-trash to automatically trash items.

659
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:24,539
Is it not enabled?

660
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:25,260
How do I enable it?

661
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:28,460
The top button, I think, enables it.

662
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,899
One of them does.

663
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:31,420
There's like side buttons on it.

664
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:34,489
Oh, okay. There we go.

665
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:39,430
This is kind of blending in.

666
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,699
What's down here?

667
01:27:52,489 --> 01:27:54,170
Pee-pee-poo-poo is down there.

668
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:55,630
Nice.

669
01:27:56,649 --> 01:27:57,210
Nice, dude.

670
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:57,930
Nice.

671
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:58,489
Yeah.

672
01:27:58,489 --> 01:27:58,989
Epic.

673
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:00,010
Hello.

674
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:01,770
It pulls out a pee-pee-poo-poo.

675
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:04,010
I love pee-pee-poo-poo.

676
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:07,210
You're really gonna pull out a pee-pee-poo-poo?

677
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,149
Yeah.

678
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:11,270
Unbelievable.

679
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:15,590
Oh, come on. Where's one?

680
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,229
I need one more.

681
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,510
How many life quarts has he walked by?

682
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:21,899
Zero.

683
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:23,340
I've been getting my eyes open.

684
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:28,409
You've been getting life quarts when you see it.

685
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,000
It's the...

686
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,800
I know what it looks like.

687
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:44,170
Life? What do you mean, life?

688
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:45,850
Yeah, he has no clue.

689
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:50,789
What do you mean, life? Cool.

690
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:51,829
You don't have to tell me something.

691
01:28:51,829 --> 01:28:53,590
It's different than the heart crystal.

692
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:54,550
It's a block.

693
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:55,670
It's heart blocks.

694
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,989
And when you combine 10, you get a life crystal.

695
01:28:57,989 --> 01:28:59,029
Oh, okay.

696
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:01,600
Cool.

697
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:04,859
That's really good to know.

698
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,460
I'm glad that you told me this.

699
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,060
I did earlier.

700
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:10,859
Hey, it doesn't matter.

701
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:11,420
What did you say?

702
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:11,899
That you're like...

703
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,060
It doesn't matter.

704
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:14,560
I'm done.

705
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,270
It doesn't matter.

706
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,770
I'm good.

707
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,970
Okay.

708
01:29:20,409 --> 01:29:21,770
Holy fucking God.

709
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,210
That would have been so embarrassing.

710
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,369
That would have been an actually, horribly embarrassing thing.

711
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,939
I would have had to delete my Twitch account

712
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:31,779
if I just fell there and died because it was dark.

713
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:36,409
All right, let me just get up there with the rope.

714
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:38,170
You move in a mixer?

715
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:42,550
It's a really easy, funny joke to make, you know?

716
01:29:43,909 --> 01:29:46,949
I mean, you really don't have to be funny on Twitch.

717
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:50,550
You just have to stay current with whatever the current thing everyone is saying.

718
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,750
And then you'll be like, accepted into the fold.

719
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,350
I have 300.

720
01:29:55,350 --> 01:30:01,380
You're trying too hard with your carnivals and your fucking movie nights.

721
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:05,720
Just like, come on.

722
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,119
Cut his mic quick.

723
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:13,670
What the fuck?

724
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,170
Okay.

725
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:19,130
I think I just would have died, but I landed on health.

726
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,369
Yeah, just throw your cat.

727
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:22,170
Get your dog in there.

728
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:23,369
Get Otto in there and chuck him.

729
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:30,180
I would never do that to a fucking dog.

730
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:33,819
You are fucked.

731
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:35,100
Hey, I got another one.

732
01:30:35,899 --> 01:30:38,460
Does Otto ever do malicious poops?

733
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,619
Like, what's with dogs and malicious poops?

734
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:42,859
Why are you saying it like that?

735
01:30:43,659 --> 01:30:47,560
Well, where it's like they poop somewhere they know they're not supposed to

736
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,960
because they're like, they're trying to get back at you.

737
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:55,510
Like me and Ashley left the house the other day for a while together

738
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:58,550
and she like, hates when people leave like all dogs do.

739
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:01,350
But she's like, such a baby.

740
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,789
I come back and there's two poops like hidden in my bathroom behind the toilet.

741
01:31:06,409 --> 01:31:07,369
Malicious poops.

742
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:08,729
All right, I'm coming back.

743
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:10,810
I have 300 health.

744
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:15,289
Are you ready to move on?

745
01:31:15,289 --> 01:31:16,170
I got 300 HP.

746
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:18,100
Oh, I'm ready to move on.

747
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:20,859
Are you?

748
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,720
Oh, yeah, I have 300 health.

749
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:25,340
Are you?

750
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,260
Wasn't that the whole point, me to get 300 health?

751
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,750
All right, this really good ring.

752
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,350
Do you like want this?

753
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:34,579
I don't even know what the hell it is.

754
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:36,590
What ring?

755
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:38,810
This, no, this anklet, sorry.

756
01:31:39,689 --> 01:31:41,130
10% increased storage speed.

757
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,079
All right, let me make sure I have everything I want.

758
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:50,119
Torch.

759
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:52,260
I want that one.

760
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:55,380
I'm almost out of apples.

761
01:31:57,539 --> 01:31:58,420
Severed hand.

762
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:01,430
Auto trash.

763
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:02,949
Is it just throw away?

764
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:04,869
Auto trash.

765
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:05,909
Okay.

766
01:32:05,909 --> 01:32:07,029
You're going to pick up a lot of them.

767
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:09,659
Anyone buy these off you?

768
01:32:12,739 --> 01:32:13,300
Not worried.

769
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:17,159
I had mud blocks in auto trash.

770
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,579
Oh, what the hell's going on here?

771
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:22,979
I'm zoom.

772
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:23,779
I need to zoom in.

773
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:28,819
You know, you can auto trash more than one thing.

774
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:31,779
Right?

775
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:37,420
I think you're getting that, right?

776
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,420
Like, how do I add another slot?

777
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:45,609
Every time you put something in the auto trash slot, it is auto trashed.

778
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,409
Even if you'll never pick it up again.

779
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:51,289
So every, even if you stack it on top of it.

780
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:52,489
Yeah.

781
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:55,210
And then if you, oh, okay.

782
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:56,729
And then if you, how do you do it?

783
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,899
I can use the middle button.

784
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:02,220
If you click the middle button, it shows you everything that's in there.

785
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,579
And then you can remove things later.

786
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:04,140
That's good to know.

787
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,640
Okay.

788
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:06,590
All right.

789
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:09,229
I believe I'm ready to do whatever you want to know.

790
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:12,750
Okay.

791
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:14,970
Um, 139.

792
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:16,090
I know I'm compromising.

793
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,210
Give me like, give me like, I'm coming.

794
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:19,850
I'm coming.

795
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:20,350
I'm coming.

796
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:21,630
Okay.

797
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:21,949
Come here.

798
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:22,449
Come here.

799
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:26,569
Take these blazing hearts for you.

800
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:29,069
Now use those.

801
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:31,149
Those are the new life crystal.

802
01:33:31,149 --> 01:33:31,649
Wow.

803
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:39,279
I couldn't find many more of them though.

804
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:40,000
That's fine.

805
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,520
We'll be fine.

806
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:42,720
I'm sorry.

807
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:45,229
You didn't use the last crystal.

808
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:46,670
I, it couldn't.

809
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:47,470
I, I couldn't.

810
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,430
It's, it's stored.

811
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:50,350
There's a life crystal just in there.

812
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:52,350
Can you do anything with them after you reach max HP?

813
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,920
I don't think so.

814
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,159
There might be some recipes with them so I'd keep it.

815
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,600
But I forget.

816
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,039
Just in the stash.

817
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,600
There's a fucking fireplace in here.

818
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,560
This guy's crazy.

819
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:13,739
Okay.

820
01:34:15,369 --> 01:34:15,869
All right.

821
01:34:19,449 --> 01:34:20,010
Very cool.

822
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,449
I need some more torches.

823
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:22,329
Are we going somewhere dark?

824
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:27,479
Um, I don't know yet.

825
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:30,270
Torches are wood and what was it?

826
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:32,270
Wood and gel or something.

827
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:32,670
And gel.

828
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:36,359
We don't have any wood.

829
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:39,600
Gonna have to cut down some trees.

830
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:40,880
Do you have any wood?

831
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:42,890
Nope.

832
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:44,649
Do we have any trees left to cut down?

833
01:34:45,529 --> 01:34:47,279
Or just buy?

834
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,479
Uh, yeah, there's trees all over the map.

835
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:51,119
Left or right?

836
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:57,630
Uh, I think I might've damned him.

837
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:58,909
Oh, he's here.

838
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:00,189
Yeah.

839
01:35:00,189 --> 01:35:01,470
This guy, the old guy with the beard.

840
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:08,890
I think I might've damned him.

841
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:10,170
I think I might've damned him.

842
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:11,210
Yeah.

843
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,970
I think he might be gone for all eternity.

844
01:35:13,529 --> 01:35:14,329
Let's do 100.

845
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:17,130
All right.

846
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,079
Where to now that we have good HP?

847
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:22,840
What's the plan?

848
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,819
Um, slime god.

849
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:26,460
Slime god.

850
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:28,859
All right.

851
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:29,819
Let's go kick his ass.

852
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:33,789
Hey, baby.

853
01:35:33,789 --> 01:35:37,869
Next time that I see you in the game, I can kick your ass.

854
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:50,140
Uh, we need one little ingredient.

855
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:55,000
You guys seriously don't remember that Reggie quote?

856
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,670
And so I'm glad that one person got that.

857
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:01,390
I actually forgot too.

858
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:02,029
Who's Reggie?

859
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:11,359
It's from the Nintendo World Championships 2014.

860
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,680
See, I didn't know that part, but you did.

861
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,319
And that's good.

862
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:26,000
As somebody myself who's sick of companies and corporations and people selling out,

863
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,920
I for one love Reggie Fils-A-Mate for selling me Nintendo games.

864
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,640
He made it fun.

865
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:33,069
You can't.

866
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:34,350
I'm sorry.

867
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:38,270
There are some things that you just you cannot like talk shit about Reggie.

868
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:39,949
You can't like that.

869
01:36:39,949 --> 01:36:41,470
I there's some things that I would tolerate.

870
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:48,159
He worked his way into my heart through a very calculated marketing plan that he himself

871
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,199
didn't even come up.

872
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,039
I fucking love that guy.

873
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:53,840
I mean, I'm just I'm not I'm not gonna I can't stand for that like at all.

874
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,439
You know what?

875
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,479
Maybe like maybe like one guy in either of our chats really thought about it for a second.

876
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:01,199
I was like, you know what?

877
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,359
Stir is a salty ball sack, but he might be right.

878
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:14,090
Okay, I can't agree with his lifestyle, but cut his bike.

879
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:21,020
I'm about to he's going to get his mic cut quick.

880
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,279
All right.

881
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:25,159
Uh, I'm ready.

882
01:37:25,159 --> 01:37:27,159
I got my bacon cheeseburger.

883
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:27,640
I'm ready.

884
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:29,789
No, just sell this.

885
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,409
Actually, we still have potion merchant.

886
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:35,800
All right.

887
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,680
That's pretty fucking good.

888
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,399
Actually, I'm going to eat it.

889
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:44,560
All right.

890
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,920
I got I just clicked the thing.

891
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,560
So we moving.

892
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:51,880
Uh, I'm grabbing a thing real quick and then we're going to fight the slime god.

893
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:07,420
Yeah, okay.

894
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:10,939
I wonder how many times and I know it's like completely necessary,

895
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:14,699
but I wonder how many times has been said during these two sessions of

896
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,039
I'm just going to go grab this thing real quick.

897
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:20,279
And he's just gone.

898
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,560
I would have to give you a whole quest to go on to like distract you.

899
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,479
And I really just need I need 25 of a specific block right now.

900
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:33,960
Do you want to walk over here with me and get this block with me, bro?

901
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,539
Well, you're like 3,500 feet away.

902
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:39,659
Exactly.

903
01:38:39,659 --> 01:38:40,859
You don't want to come do this.

904
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:45,899
I'm just going to go get this thing real quick.

905
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:47,500
I need a couple of these real quick.

906
01:38:48,859 --> 01:38:51,930
Oh, I defeated my 200 zombie.

907
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:52,170
Cool.

908
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:55,789
I'm going to need you over here really fast.

909
01:38:57,369 --> 01:38:59,930
I need help collecting these ebstone blocks.

910
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:00,329
Oh, wait.

911
01:39:00,329 --> 01:39:01,930
I already have 500.

912
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:03,770
Uh, never mind.

913
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:04,409
So what's this?

914
01:39:04,409 --> 01:39:06,010
What's the slime gods?

915
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:07,869
Move set.

916
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,380
Hold on.

917
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:14,810
Do I dodge left or dodge right?

918
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:16,810
You have to dodge both.

919
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:20,300
That's the crazy thing.

920
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,460
This deadly boss mod is going to tell me what to do.

921
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:40,590
And we got like a cricket sound effect.

922
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:44,029
I'm dealing with a lot in my life.

923
01:39:44,029 --> 01:39:44,750
Okay.

924
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:45,869
You show no respect.

925
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:47,949
I give you a lot of space.

926
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:49,229
No, I'm talking about like no.

927
01:39:49,229 --> 01:39:49,550
Wow.

928
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:49,949
Okay.

929
01:39:49,949 --> 01:39:51,710
That's you had something to say.

930
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:57,710
I'm talking about like I'm I'm outside right now and it's like it's quiet.

931
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,750
Oh, boy.

932
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,670
That was like that was a loaded cannon.

933
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:01,630
Just ready to blow.

934
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:02,750
I'm sorry.

935
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,710
You don't even know.

936
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:07,479
Okay, German.

937
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:08,600
This is going to be a hard fight.

938
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,560
Deep issues.

939
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:10,760
All right.

940
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,479
Hard fight.

941
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:14,600
If you if you do have any potions or like a buff.

942
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:16,520
I just took my bacon buff.

943
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:21,260
A potion I threw to you increases mana regen.

944
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:22,319
Yeah.

945
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:25,770
Take seven minute duration.

946
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:27,579
All right.

947
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:28,060
I took it.

948
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:30,199
Is it going to be tough you said?

949
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:33,659
Yeah.

950
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,979
If you run too far away from you, they like run at you really fast and like slam you hard.

951
01:40:39,979 --> 01:40:44,859
So you got to focus more on dodging rather than running dodging slime blobs that are

952
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:46,699
going to bounce at you and try and jump on you.

953
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:47,180
Right.

954
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:52,050
While one like slime orb comes after you.

955
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:53,329
So dodging is more important.

956
01:40:53,329 --> 01:40:55,250
It's just a lot of shit on the screen.

957
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,649
We need to kill the big blobs as quickly as we can.

958
01:40:57,649 --> 01:40:59,329
Big blob as quick as possible.

959
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,810
Okay, I'm ready to give it a try.

960
01:41:02,449 --> 01:41:05,569
Where do they spy?

961
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:13,250
Usually we you like, oh, let's build like a platform to fight them.

962
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:16,449
Or just now most bosses we're just doing right here.

963
01:41:16,449 --> 01:41:16,949
Okay.

964
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:23,520
So focus on dodging.

965
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,720
Dodging is more important than.

966
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:26,159
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

967
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,199
Wow, that's so weird.

968
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:28,239
Don't do that.

969
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:28,560
I know.

970
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,359
I was just curious.

971
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:30,159
Wait, what?

972
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:31,279
Because you did it second.

973
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:34,560
Now we have I don't understand why it's like overriding our centuries.

974
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,439
So you have to do that.

975
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:36,319
Just leave them here then.

976
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:37,439
Just don't even spawn another one.

977
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:38,560
Right.

978
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,680
I need to touch the table.

979
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:46,130
Make sure you use your apple.

980
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:47,970
I have a burger.

981
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:51,680
I've got bacon already.

982
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,079
I'm ready.

983
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,539
Where's he at?

984
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:58,430
Okay, so you have to dodge that one.

985
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:00,029
Don't worry about destroying that one.

986
01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:00,510
The brain.

987
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,170
Oh, yeah.

988
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:04,289
And it confuses you and shit.

989
01:42:04,289 --> 01:42:05,569
It's really annoying.

990
01:42:05,569 --> 01:42:09,630
So don't get hit by the brain as you've called it.

991
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,720
Ouch.

992
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:23,680
Ouch.

993
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,319
Oh, my God.

994
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:25,439
I'm not I'm so slow.

995
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:39,840
Oh, my God.

996
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,640
I'm going to fucking.

997
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:43,359
Let me climb the rope.

998
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:44,640
Don't die.

999
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:45,199
Don't just run.

1000
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:45,600
Just run.

1001
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,159
Just run.

1002
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:51,739
Oh, God damn it.

1003
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:52,380
I'm very slow.

1004
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:55,409
Yeah, we both are.

1005
01:42:55,409 --> 01:42:56,529
It's kind of a problem.

1006
01:42:57,569 --> 01:42:59,170
Because we've never found boots.

1007
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:03,329
And even though I've gotten like every single NPC in the goddamn game,

1008
01:43:03,329 --> 01:43:04,609
we still never got the cobbler.

1009
01:43:05,409 --> 01:43:14,079
Yeah, I feel like I'm on slash walk right now.

1010
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:21,380
Yeah, it's kind of you can't you really can't dodge those things

1011
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,659
unless you can move faster.

1012
01:43:22,659 --> 01:43:27,020
I'm assuming there's this.

1013
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:30,140
I mean, there's the thing I just got that like 10 percent movement speed thing.

1014
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:35,420
There is also the if you kill the eye of Cthulhu on expert,

1015
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:37,100
it gives you a dash you can use.

1016
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:39,779
That's a pain in the ass.

1017
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:44,340
And I do it accidentally more often than I do it intentionally.

1018
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,500
Should we just stack movement speed to do this

1019
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,140
and forget about any other buff things?

1020
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:56,529
No, I think there was I thought there was a person in here.

1021
01:43:56,529 --> 01:43:57,810
I'm like, why is there a guy in here?

1022
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,560
Where's the one that I got?

1023
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,020
Not equipment.

1024
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:10,159
Yeah, there's 10 percent movement speed.

1025
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,600
I think it's going to wear it.

1026
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:12,640
What would I replace this with?

1027
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:15,119
The bees thing isn't a lot.

1028
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,159
I mean, it's better than nothing.

1029
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:21,869
Use the grappling hook to move quickly.

1030
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:32,029
Yeah, but even then we really need like boots or something.

1031
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:36,350
I'm going to build rooms and see if the guy shows up.

1032
01:44:39,869 --> 01:44:42,109
When did I pick up a thousand torches?

1033
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:50,000
Well, I had these for a while or this is this minion damage increase by one.

1034
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,560
It's really not a big deal at all, right?

1035
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:54,479
Not really.

1036
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:56,180
I'm just going to wear the anklet then.

1037
01:45:03,819 --> 01:45:06,380
I mean, that's a when the fuck did you like?

1038
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,640
I guess it really is not that big of a difference.

1039
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:15,279
It kind of is.

1040
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,680
You can craft Hermes boots with calamity mod using 10 silk.

1041
01:45:23,739 --> 01:45:26,140
Now, when you talk to Hermes boots,

1042
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:29,420
is that like an you talking about an item to make or drop or find?

1043
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:30,939
Oh, yeah, you can.

1044
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:38,189
Well, it's like a 10 step program, too, because we have to make a loom.

1045
01:45:38,909 --> 01:45:39,409
Loom?

1046
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:41,229
I forgot how to do all.

1047
01:45:41,229 --> 01:45:42,750
You know, I need like a cheater mod.

1048
01:45:44,189 --> 01:45:44,909
I need wood.

1049
01:45:44,909 --> 01:45:46,510
Can you just go collect wood?

1050
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:48,029
Can you go knock down some trees?

1051
01:45:48,989 --> 01:45:50,699
Yeah.

1052
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:51,659
Yeah, I can.

1053
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,579
Go chop wood, son, please.

1054
01:45:53,579 --> 01:45:54,300
How much do you want?

1055
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,149
Just so much.

1056
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:00,750
So wait, I need my axe.

1057
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:01,869
I don't even have an axe.

1058
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:03,390
Come on, please.

1059
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:09,039
Wait, is it piggy bank over?

1060
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:09,920
You can use bombs.

1061
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:23,859
People tell us to replant the trees.

1062
01:46:23,859 --> 01:46:24,659
And why did you do this?

1063
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:30,880
Am I making it harder for me to get in my own house?

1064
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,619
Uh, is there even an axe in here?

1065
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,380
Did we throw away all of our axes?

1066
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:43,649
Maybe.

1067
01:46:43,649 --> 01:46:44,689
I think we may have.

1068
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:45,569
Doesn't this guy sell them?

1069
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:50,189
I'm going to buy a copper axe.

1070
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:53,329
OK.

1071
01:46:54,029 --> 01:46:54,989
Copper axe.

1072
01:46:59,409 --> 01:47:01,329
People are telling me to talk to the guy with the quest.

1073
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:04,239
Fighting the heat.

1074
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,619
We're in Egypt when he told me about this artifact and it was very hot there.

1075
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,600
Some kind of ice crystal.

1076
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:14,779
Some kind of ice crystal that can cool things.

1077
01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:19,739
I thought it would be awesome if I could cool down by using it when it's too hot outside.

1078
01:47:19,739 --> 01:47:23,579
I only know that the different ice creatures contain this crystal inside them.

1079
01:47:23,579 --> 01:47:24,619
Can you please find it?

1080
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,859
OK.

1081
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,829
Find the ice crystal.

1082
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:38,100
But first, my most important mission is go collect wood for dad.

1083
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:42,289
That's more important.

1084
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:46,130
God damn it.

1085
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:49,659
Jeremy, you're supposed to chop wood.

1086
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:51,260
And you didn't.

1087
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:55,340
Me and your mother need one moment alone.

1088
01:48:01,489 --> 01:48:03,890
So do you want like a thousand wood?

1089
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,689
500 would be like art.

1090
01:48:08,689 --> 01:48:09,409
OK.

1091
01:48:09,409 --> 01:48:10,449
I'll just get a thousand.

1092
01:48:12,989 --> 01:48:14,510
And then we're replanting these trees.

1093
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:18,739
OK.

1094
01:48:18,739 --> 01:48:21,140
I've got us the max storage space.

1095
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:22,739
We've got we've got a lot of space.

1096
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:23,939
We're doing good on space.

1097
01:48:24,899 --> 01:48:26,500
How do you replant a tree?

1098
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:31,140
Just kind of acorn the acorn and you like eat it and you poop it or something.

1099
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:43,939
Father makes son get a thousand logs.

1100
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:50,270
And that is it.

1101
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:53,869
That is at least the second or third like peepee poo poo joke.

1102
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,029
From do you know how old I am?

1103
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:57,470
I do actually.

1104
01:48:58,750 --> 01:48:59,380
All right.

1105
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,060
You want more than 500.

1106
01:49:01,699 --> 01:49:14,529
Dude, you I am I doing this wrong?

1107
01:49:16,689 --> 01:49:17,649
I'm OK.

1108
01:49:17,649 --> 01:49:19,010
I'm just looking through our storage and

1109
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,329
I'm finding a lot of things I didn't know we had that are really good things

1110
01:49:23,329 --> 01:49:24,770
that I should have known we had.

1111
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,170
Yeah.

1112
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:26,050
Every once in a while.

1113
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:32,079
Like there was a bat hook, which is just a better version of the hook you already have.

1114
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:32,640
Oh, cool.

1115
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:37,199
There was like a 56 damage sword.

1116
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:39,279
Nice.

1117
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:41,260
Yeah.

1118
01:49:43,329 --> 01:49:45,890
Anything else like I should know about in here?

1119
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:47,409
I told you about the weapon in there and you went.

1120
01:49:49,579 --> 01:49:50,140
Did I?

1121
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,819
Yeah, I said, hey, this is this weapon here.

1122
01:49:51,819 --> 01:49:52,460
It's like cool.

1123
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,779
And you were like, no, not worth it.

1124
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:07,680
Does that mean trees going to be growing over here?

1125
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,439
Oh, and there's also working.

1126
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:11,439
You should have a minotaur skull because, you know, there's someone

1127
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:16,050
that's on the helmet, right?

1128
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:16,850
OK, yeah, it's not.

1129
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:19,329
Is it too close?

1130
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:22,319
You need three blocks in between them.

1131
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:27,020
OK, just plant trees out here.

1132
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:33,020
Can I imitate a bop it, please?

1133
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:51,039
I think I did that like two years ago to get high trees.

1134
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:52,880
You need three blocks in between the seeds.

1135
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,199
All right.

1136
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,470
I'll just put them every so often, you know.

1137
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:58,850
All right.

1138
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,289
I'm going to have like a thousand wood here soon.

1139
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:11,659
I currently have 571.

1140
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:20,659
No, no, no, no, you don't.

1141
01:51:20,659 --> 01:51:22,260
I plan to torch.

1142
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,659
That's not what I wanted to do.

1143
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:49,760
Germa terraria, germa terraria, germa terraria with a bunch of pogchamps.

1144
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:54,399
Pog, pog, pog, pog, pog, pog.

1145
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:55,520
What's the hardest thing in the whole game?

1146
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:57,390
All right.

1147
01:51:57,390 --> 01:52:01,310
Well, what's the thing in the game that is so difficult that you have to play perfectly

1148
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:04,510
and there's still a random chance that you're going to lose no matter what you do?

1149
01:52:05,229 --> 01:52:10,899
The final calamity boss, which I can't call me this or something.

1150
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:13,039
Cal Midas.

1151
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,560
It's something like that.

1152
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:19,100
Supreme Calamity Calamity.

1153
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:21,020
Yeah, that's the one.

1154
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:21,739
Have you ever beat it?

1155
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:27,329
My game actually bugged at a certain point in Calamity, so I never got to the end.

1156
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:31,489
One of the bosses would appear and then run away from me.

1157
01:52:31,489 --> 01:52:32,609
So I just kind of stopped playing.

1158
01:52:33,569 --> 01:52:34,529
Time to operate.

1159
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,130
I forgot about that.

1160
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,090
Sorry, we're just talking about like funny jokes in the stream.

1161
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:39,649
You know what I mean?

1162
01:52:39,649 --> 01:52:41,489
Oh, yeah, I understand.

1163
01:52:41,489 --> 01:52:42,050
Funny jokes.

1164
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:56,159
It was like a storm wraith worm that you absolutely 100% need to continue progression.

1165
01:52:57,539 --> 01:52:58,979
Just would run away.

1166
01:52:59,779 --> 01:53:00,859
For a second.

1167
01:53:00,859 --> 01:53:01,819
I thought that was said.

1168
01:53:01,819 --> 01:53:03,979
Germa has cut down his 50th tree or something.

1169
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:15,229
I was like, well, did 50th slime.

1170
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:17,229
I feel like I've killed way more than 50 slimes.

1171
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,750
They just accidentally get in the way and you just chop through them.

1172
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:27,340
How long does it take for a tree to grow?

1173
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:31,600
I do.

1174
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,000
I don't know.

1175
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,239
Just just sit there forever.

1176
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,199
Okay.

1177
01:53:37,069 --> 01:53:38,510
That's what chat wants you to do.

1178
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:42,350
That's been like telling you to plant trees since we started this playthrough.

1179
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:44,750
So you're going to sit there and you're going to wait until those trees grow.

1180
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:46,829
Why haven't you planted any trees?

1181
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:50,319
Because it's a waste of time.

1182
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:50,560
What?

1183
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:53,899
What do you mean it's a waste of time?

1184
01:53:58,130 --> 01:53:59,250
Why am I doing this thing?

1185
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:02,050
If you just walked it to your right, there's more trees.

1186
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:17,149
There's some more trees over there.

1187
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:21,170
Okay.

1188
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:24,829
Well, I'm coming back with 833 wood.

1189
01:54:24,829 --> 01:54:25,550
Is that enough for you?

1190
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:27,949
That is more than enough.

1191
01:54:27,949 --> 01:54:29,310
We'll probably never get through that.

1192
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:31,229
So all the trees you planted kind of pointless.

1193
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:33,949
Just throwing it out there.

1194
01:54:35,069 --> 01:54:36,350
Well, it was good to know.

1195
01:54:36,989 --> 01:54:37,310
Yeah.

1196
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:38,510
I mean, it was, you know, learned.

1197
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:39,310
You learned next week.

1198
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:39,869
I'll remind you.

1199
01:54:43,729 --> 01:54:44,210
Here you go.

1200
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:48,460
Dickhead.

1201
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:52,340
Go get it.

1202
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:54,579
I'm sorry.

1203
01:54:54,579 --> 01:54:54,899
I'll get it.

1204
01:54:54,899 --> 01:54:55,220
I'm sorry.

1205
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:55,779
I'll go get that.

1206
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:56,020
I'm sorry.

1207
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:56,659
That was my fault.

1208
01:54:58,239 --> 01:54:58,720
Wow.

1209
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:00,000
Wow.

1210
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,279
Germa uncensored.

1211
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:01,840
Ha ha.

1212
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,399
Oh God.

1213
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:07,260
You want this or not?

1214
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:08,399
I do.

1215
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:13,579
I forget why I want it.

1216
01:55:13,579 --> 01:55:14,619
Why did we need it?

1217
01:55:14,619 --> 01:55:15,020
I don't know.

1218
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,460
You just maybe go do that.

1219
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,539
You said when I need 500, we'll do it.

1220
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:20,140
500.

1221
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:20,779
We'll do it.

1222
01:55:20,779 --> 01:55:21,979
Was that a punishment?

1223
01:55:21,979 --> 01:55:24,619
Like father, son, you go chop wood.

1224
01:55:24,619 --> 01:55:26,539
And I don't remember why I wanted it.

1225
01:55:26,539 --> 01:55:29,020
Was that just you just punishing me?

1226
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:33,170
No, I like actually needed it, but I don't know why.

1227
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:35,760
Oh my God.

1228
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:39,279
The loom for the loom.

1229
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:39,680
The loom.

1230
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,159
The loom.

1231
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:49,550
Are you building a loom right now or have you DCed?

1232
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:53,140
Loom for the boots.

1233
01:55:53,939 --> 01:55:54,500
He muted.

1234
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:59,819
Germa uncensored.

1235
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:00,300
Ha ha.

1236
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:00,939
Oh God.

1237
01:56:04,909 --> 01:56:10,670
Look, it was like a different time back in 2012.

1238
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:15,359
Titles, I didn't even like, nobody even knew what to do.

1239
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:20,609
Nobody.

1240
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:29,619
Your titles in like 2011, 2012 were not like cool, like ironic, funny titles.

1241
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:31,539
You can just forget about that.

1242
01:56:31,539 --> 01:56:32,100
Come over here.

1243
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:35,619
Can you talk to Popo while I talk to Popo?

1244
01:56:35,619 --> 01:56:36,739
Is that a thing?

1245
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:37,460
Yes.

1246
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:40,100
So he sells potions.

1247
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:40,899
He's our guy.

1248
01:56:40,899 --> 01:56:43,619
Before we fight a boss, he's our freaking guy.

1249
01:56:43,619 --> 01:56:49,859
Okay, so vanilla potions gives you an extra summon, health regeneration, extra defense.

1250
01:56:49,859 --> 01:56:50,899
He is our guy.

1251
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,859
There's actually one button, I forget what it is.

1252
01:56:53,859 --> 01:56:56,020
Someone probably knows.

1253
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:59,779
You press one button, it drinks all the unique potions you have in your whole inventory.

1254
01:56:59,779 --> 01:57:00,100
Really?

1255
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:04,029
B.

1256
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:05,470
Yeah, so don't accidentally press B.

1257
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,189
Don't press B.

1258
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,600
Until you need to press B.

1259
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:13,489
Let's you move swiftly in liquid.

1260
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:15,020
Okay.

1261
01:57:19,729 --> 01:57:22,289
Oh, also take, here, take this.

1262
01:57:22,289 --> 01:57:23,569
I'm giving you a skull.

1263
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:25,010
I'm currently trying to process.

1264
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:26,930
Well, it's a very important item that I got.

1265
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:28,130
I got it for you.

1266
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:34,430
You just, I'm like, I just turned 21 and you brought me into the fucking bar.

1267
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:36,029
And you're like, hey, what do you want?

1268
01:57:36,029 --> 01:57:38,750
It's like, I, what even is rum?

1269
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:40,510
What the fuck does vodka taste like?

1270
01:57:40,510 --> 01:57:41,310
I don't know.

1271
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:42,189
Hold on a second.

1272
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:44,930
Iron skin.

1273
01:57:47,899 --> 01:57:49,340
Oh, you get iron skin.

1274
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:51,819
I'm trying.

1275
01:57:52,539 --> 01:57:57,779
Increases D.

1276
01:57:57,779 --> 01:57:58,500
That's a lot.

1277
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:58,739
Yeah.

1278
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:01,710
Do I not have any money?

1279
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:02,590
Where's all my money?

1280
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,420
What did you say?

1281
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:04,659
Okay.

1282
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,899
Fleeting Minotaur skull.

1283
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:08,899
Here's some money.

1284
01:58:08,899 --> 01:58:11,659
Increases your max number of minions by one.

1285
01:58:11,659 --> 01:58:13,579
Decreases non-minion damage by 10%.

1286
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,659
Is this a helmet?

1287
01:58:16,699 --> 01:58:18,060
It's an accessory.

1288
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,819
Yes, but this is, this is a skull.

1289
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:20,699
No drama.

1290
01:58:20,699 --> 01:58:22,779
No, that's a skull.

1291
01:58:22,779 --> 01:58:23,979
We had the same conversation.

1292
01:58:23,979 --> 01:58:25,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1293
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:27,020
A heart is like as big as your fist.

1294
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:31,359
A Minotaur skull is like a huge fucking skull hollowed out.

1295
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:33,039
We've had this conversation before.

1296
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:33,600
No, no, no.

1297
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:35,199
I'm not going to have it again with you.

1298
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:36,720
I refuse to accept that one.

1299
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:39,470
So what do I replace then?

1300
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,460
This one's 20 mana.

1301
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:42,939
That's pretty good.

1302
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:49,340
A Minotaur skull would like, it would be too big.

1303
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:52,460
Yeah, real life Minotaur.

1304
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:55,500
Hello.

1305
01:59:02,369 --> 01:59:04,689
Get rid of the B, but it's plus four defense.

1306
01:59:04,689 --> 01:59:05,250
That's a lot.

1307
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:10,340
Is plus four D.

1308
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:11,460
That's a lot of defense, right?

1309
01:59:14,449 --> 01:59:16,000
It's okay.

1310
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,920
So I wouldn't want to replace that.

1311
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,760
What about the 20, maybe the 20 mana?

1312
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:22,060
What is 20?

1313
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:23,260
Yeah, get that out of here.

1314
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:30,109
It's not, I mean, slowly generate life, but that's another minion.

1315
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:33,390
And I can't just put it on.

1316
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:36,289
Yeah.

1317
01:59:36,289 --> 01:59:38,369
Now I can have like five of these fucking things.

1318
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,609
Get rid of the crappy anklet.

1319
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:45,810
I remember why we needed wood, but I think it's good.

1320
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:49,090
Okay.

1321
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:51,140
Crappy anklet.

1322
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:51,779
This is good.

1323
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:56,699
Well, this is, okay, you, there's a,

1324
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:58,300
why do I have candy cane blocks here?

1325
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,420
Isn't that what you wanted?

1326
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:07,310
Do we need any blood drop, green slime?

1327
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:09,069
But I'm just saying literally everything I have.

1328
02:00:10,189 --> 02:00:11,310
Just dump it.

1329
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:12,270
This person's name.

1330
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:20,609
I just got five community subs from somebody named Jerma sucks.

1331
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:26,609
It's like capital J and capital S, just Jerma sucks.

1332
02:00:27,329 --> 02:00:29,010
S-U-C-K-S.

1333
02:00:29,010 --> 02:00:29,489
My man.

1334
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:41,890
Well, thank you, by the way.

1335
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:48,939
How do I make a loom?

1336
02:00:48,939 --> 02:00:49,659
A sawmill?

1337
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,260
37 gold.

1338
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:53,199
What am I doing?

1339
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:54,159
All right.

1340
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,039
You wanted me to buy.

1341
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,810
Okay.

1342
02:00:57,810 --> 02:01:00,210
I'm going to buy man of a generation potion.

1343
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:01,329
Right?

1344
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:04,449
I already did it, so you can't tell me no.

1345
02:01:05,329 --> 02:01:05,970
Iron skin.

1346
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:07,409
Should I buy like a few of each of these?

1347
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,810
Yeah, because you're going to keep using them.

1348
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:12,340
Iron chain.

1349
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:12,739
That's right.

1350
02:01:12,739 --> 02:01:15,859
That's the stupid random thing that you need to make the one time.

1351
02:01:15,859 --> 02:01:18,020
It makes, oh, let's make 10 chains.

1352
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:20,420
Like I'm not destroying the environment by doing this.

1353
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:22,180
I only need one, but I'll buy 10.

1354
02:01:22,819 --> 02:01:25,890
Thanks for selling it in a pack.

1355
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:27,329
Obsidian skin potion.

1356
02:01:28,369 --> 02:01:29,090
Light regen.

1357
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:30,289
Yeah.

1358
02:01:31,649 --> 02:01:35,250
And then shine.

1359
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:36,979
Marmo light in the abyss.

1360
02:01:36,979 --> 02:01:37,539
What's that mean?

1361
02:01:38,909 --> 02:01:40,029
Ah, don't worry about that.

1362
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:41,649
Oh, spelunker.

1363
02:01:42,369 --> 02:01:43,090
These are expensive.

1364
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,060
Do we need these anymore?

1365
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,260
We don't need spelunkers anymore, do we?

1366
02:01:48,909 --> 02:01:49,949
We will always need them.

1367
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:55,279
Well, this seems insanely important.

1368
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:56,399
I'm going to get like 10 of these.

1369
02:01:57,359 --> 02:01:58,720
Max number of minions.

1370
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,239
Top row is up there.

1371
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:01,760
Okay, that looks like a sawmill.

1372
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:09,819
Am I spending all of our money?

1373
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,140
You're spending a lot of it.

1374
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:12,699
It's fine.

1375
02:02:12,699 --> 02:02:15,020
We had like 40 gold when it's gone.

1376
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:18,140
I mean, just go through all my expenses.

1377
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,020
What's the big deal?

1378
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:24,560
It's all gone.

1379
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,000
I used 40 gold.

1380
02:02:29,329 --> 02:02:31,010
This is why you have to like get it.

1381
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,850
You have to like get a different box from me.

1382
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:34,930
You just make, all right.

1383
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:36,289
Listen, let me tell you something.

1384
02:02:36,289 --> 02:02:37,890
Let me get, this is a strategy we're going to use.

1385
02:02:38,449 --> 02:02:42,130
Make me a separate box for me to put my stuff in.

1386
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:43,329
And then you can just go in there.

1387
02:02:43,329 --> 02:02:46,609
Too many of them might crash or cause problems in multiplayer.

1388
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,130
Oh, all right, never mind.

1389
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:50,720
So I'd rather just have it all in one spot.

1390
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:53,840
And even then, I think it was making too many slots

1391
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,239
might be a problem, but I don't know.

1392
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:56,640
Okay.

1393
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,109
Well, I'm going to, I don't want to press B on some of these.

1394
02:03:00,989 --> 02:03:02,880
Yeah, you have cobweb.

1395
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,359
You must have like a million cobweb.

1396
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:07,600
I probably have put like hundreds of it in here.

1397
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,640
Is it in your ammo?

1398
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,680
Sometimes it goes there.

1399
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:15,920
Uh, no, I have snow, I have 12 snowballs.

1400
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:18,100
I swear to God, I had cobweb.

1401
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,060
Did you already take it out of here?

1402
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:22,289
Yeah.

1403
02:03:22,289 --> 02:03:23,569
Upgrade your copper axe.

1404
02:03:23,569 --> 02:03:25,170
No, I just, all right.

1405
02:03:25,170 --> 02:03:26,210
I want this, whatever it is.

1406
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:27,409
What is this?

1407
02:03:27,409 --> 02:03:29,810
Because that is, I want like the fucking popsicle.

1408
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:33,340
Is it, can you get, is there one that exists in this game

1409
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:34,539
that has blue as well?

1410
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,460
You know, like the rocket popsicles.

1411
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:38,770
What are you talking about?

1412
02:03:38,770 --> 02:03:39,270
What?

1413
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,000
Damn.

1414
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,159
Oh my God, I forgot about auto houses.

1415
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,510
My God.

1416
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,630
Kind of irrelevant now.

1417
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:53,310
Why are there two Minotaur skulls in here?

1418
02:03:53,949 --> 02:03:57,220
Because I had more than one.

1419
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:59,380
Uh, I think later on you can combine them with some stuff.

1420
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:02,770
Let me see how many of these I can have.

1421
02:04:02,770 --> 02:04:06,619
Oh man, that's insane.

1422
02:04:06,619 --> 02:04:08,140
Five of these things just flying around.

1423
02:04:08,699 --> 02:04:10,539
Five of these things in two of these centuries.

1424
02:04:11,579 --> 02:04:18,939
So you, can you stack the skulls?

1425
02:04:21,869 --> 02:04:22,989
I don't think so.

1426
02:04:22,989 --> 02:04:23,630
Are you sure?

1427
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,029
Can you?

1428
02:04:25,069 --> 02:04:27,630
I mean, I don't see why not.

1429
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:32,289
Um, huh, well.

1430
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:35,220
I've never thought about that.

1431
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:36,020
No, you can't.

1432
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,380
No, they're unique.

1433
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:44,609
Oh well.

1434
02:04:44,609 --> 02:04:50,029
All right, so I'm going to, I've got,

1435
02:04:50,029 --> 02:04:52,029
I'm pretty much ready to do whatever you want to do.

1436
02:04:52,909 --> 02:04:55,739
I just need to go get one thing real quick.

1437
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,159
Sure you do.

1438
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:00,560
I'm sure you do.

1439
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,399
If we want to fight the slime god again,

1440
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:05,439
and I personally, that's what I want to do.

1441
02:05:05,439 --> 02:05:06,800
You want to fight slime god again?

1442
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,359
Okay.

1443
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:08,720
We need more blighted gel.

1444
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:14,539
Hey Jeremy, can you give a shout out to my cat by going pss pss pss?

1445
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:15,039
Yeah.

1446
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,649
Pss pss pss pss.

1447
02:05:17,649 --> 02:05:18,850
All right, so I'm going to go get that.

1448
02:05:19,409 --> 02:05:21,329
All right, you're going to go get something real quick?

1449
02:05:21,329 --> 02:05:21,729
Yep.

1450
02:05:21,729 --> 02:05:22,689
I'm going to go get something to eat.

1451
02:05:27,159 --> 02:05:28,520
Combine, wait, there was a, there was a,

1452
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,800
there was an advice Jupiter.

1453
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:33,560
Combine the minotaur skull with your necromancer's heart.

1454
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:39,640
Um, no, I think you also need a soul stone.

1455
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:41,640
Hold on, wait, what do you mean?

1456
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:44,880
You might also need a soul stone to make what he's doing.

1457
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,399
I talked to a craft guy.

1458
02:05:46,399 --> 02:05:47,039
It's Jeffrey, right?

1459
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:50,819
Remember, am I muted or am I talking to you?

1460
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:52,579
His name's Jeffrey, right?

1461
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:53,859
I don't remember.

1462
02:05:53,859 --> 02:05:54,579
Ah, sorry.

1463
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:59,439
Wait, I put the minotaur skull on the crafting thing.

1464
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:01,039
Okay, I need a soul stone.

1465
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:02,850
What is that?

1466
02:06:03,409 --> 02:06:06,050
10% increase minion damage, increase your mach number of minions,

1467
02:06:06,050 --> 02:06:07,489
increase your mach number of sentries.

1468
02:06:08,369 --> 02:06:13,010
Taking fatal damage will instead return you to 20 life every five minutes.

1469
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:14,130
Where do we get a soul stone?

1470
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:19,989
Uh, we need a mana bauble and blood.

1471
02:06:20,949 --> 02:06:22,470
I think we might have one of those.

1472
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:24,069
Uh, search for mana bauble.

1473
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,180
Mana bauble?

1474
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:27,640
Yeah.

1475
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:34,159
Oh, mana bauble you could just make with 15 arcane dust.

1476
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:37,600
But the thing we don't have is the goblin to combine trinkets,

1477
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:39,359
so we can't actually do that yet.

1478
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:39,859
What?

1479
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:43,029
We have to find the goblin guy.

1480
02:06:43,029 --> 02:06:46,630
Sometimes he's in the dungeon, like, bound,

1481
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,670
or he's underground, like, tied up, and you need to rescue him.

1482
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:55,090
And he's really important.

1483
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:56,369
Just make the mana bauble?

1484
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:58,390
Yeah, you could.

1485
02:06:59,029 --> 02:07:01,649
You might as well do that now.

1486
02:07:01,649 --> 02:07:03,569
So what does it take to do to make a mana bauble?

1487
02:07:03,569 --> 02:07:04,850
What does it have to put in there?

1488
02:07:05,489 --> 02:07:09,170
15 arcane dust, which is you can make from fallen stars.

1489
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:09,649
Oh, okay.

1490
02:07:09,649 --> 02:07:11,489
I have 10 fallen stars on me right now,

1491
02:07:11,489 --> 02:07:13,810
so I can basically make it when I come back.

1492
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:17,189
I don't think we have any fallen stars.

1493
02:07:17,189 --> 02:07:19,430
Hey, I have 10 fallen stars on me right now,

1494
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:20,789
so I can make it when I come back.

1495
02:07:20,789 --> 02:07:23,189
Yeah, but I wanted to do something because I'm useless.

1496
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:25,859
I'm just like the guy standing.

1497
02:07:25,859 --> 02:07:27,779
I'm like an NPC in your house.

1498
02:07:27,779 --> 02:07:30,340
Well, do some research.

1499
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:31,460
You gotta let me fly.

1500
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:33,760
You gotta let me fly.

1501
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,920
Try and find the goblin guy.

1502
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:43,159
Get some cobwebs.

1503
02:07:43,159 --> 02:07:48,069
I'm gonna go cobweb hunting.

1504
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:51,000
Let's kill spiders, I'm assuming, right?

1505
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,960
I already forget why I needed the silk in the first place.

1506
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:57,430
Tori is like, that's like, okay, I need a loom.

1507
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,069
I should do this.

1508
02:07:58,069 --> 02:07:59,750
I need to get, I need a sawmill.

1509
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,710
Okay, now I've got this.

1510
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:01,909
I need cobweb to make...

1511
02:08:01,909 --> 02:08:03,270
Why do I need silk for?

1512
02:08:04,130 --> 02:08:06,050
Oh, for boots to make boots.

1513
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:06,689
Okay.

1514
02:08:06,689 --> 02:08:08,770
You need to cut a hundred, a thousand wood.

1515
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:13,510
I need to cut a thousand trees down to summon the goblin.

1516
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:13,909
Sure.

1517
02:08:13,909 --> 02:08:15,350
Son, go get some cobweb.

1518
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,439
All right. Cobweb comes with spiders.

1519
02:08:18,439 --> 02:08:20,439
Spiders come from underground.

1520
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:21,800
We can fight the god again.

1521
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,880
All right.

1522
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,640
Or do you want to get the boots first?

1523
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,569
Um, let's, let's try it again.

1524
02:08:27,569 --> 02:08:28,449
Let's fight.

1525
02:08:28,449 --> 02:08:29,250
Let's win.

1526
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,630
I've got extra minions.

1527
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:31,350
Wait, this is cobweb.

1528
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:33,109
Barry the cob, the cobbler!

1529
02:08:33,109 --> 02:08:33,829
Cobbler!

1530
02:08:33,829 --> 02:08:35,170
There he is, right?

1531
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:35,890
Where is he?

1532
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:37,649
He's, I don't know, find him.

1533
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:40,760
The kick your ass.

1534
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:41,399
Is he in there?

1535
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:43,399
Is he in there to kick your ass?

1536
02:08:43,399 --> 02:08:48,529
Oh, he's on the roof.

1537
02:08:48,529 --> 02:08:49,409
Is that him?

1538
02:08:49,409 --> 02:08:50,449
Yeah, that's him.

1539
02:08:50,449 --> 02:08:54,840
I don't think he sells the specific thing we need, though.

1540
02:08:54,840 --> 02:09:00,199
But he does have boots that help you run.

1541
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:00,920
Whoa.

1542
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:01,640
What is this stuff?

1543
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,359
Okay, hold on.

1544
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:04,199
Too bad I spent all, we don't have any money.

1545
02:09:04,199 --> 02:09:08,039
Healthy boots.

1546
02:09:08,039 --> 02:09:09,649
Oh, no, he does sell Hermes boots.

1547
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:14,770
I think he spent all our money.

1548
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:18,449
Five gold for Hermes boots,

1549
02:09:18,449 --> 02:09:20,369
or we can just like gather cobweb.

1550
02:09:20,369 --> 02:09:21,649
I am gathering nothing.

1551
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:23,729
Find a pig.

1552
02:09:23,729 --> 02:09:24,930
We have 28 gold in the story.

1553
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:34,239
American runs super fast.

1554
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:36,869
Damaging drops from below your boots.

1555
02:09:36,869 --> 02:09:38,390
So Hermes boots are just,

1556
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:41,510
you just put them on and never take them off.

1557
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:43,109
You'll take them off eventually, but.

1558
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:48,340
And also I'm pretty sure we have the stuff

1559
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:50,659
to combine with Hermes boots to make lightning boots.

1560
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:51,460
Let me check on that.

1561
02:09:52,180 --> 02:10:00,039
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1562
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:02,359
Oh, we need the fucking goblin.

1563
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:04,279
Everything, everything.

1564
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:09,640
We need rocket boots and the goblin sells rocket boots.

1565
02:10:11,619 --> 02:10:14,020
And yeah, and we couldn't combine without the tinker anyway.

1566
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:14,979
God damn it, dude.

1567
02:10:15,779 --> 02:10:18,199
All right, well, let's just kill this guy.

1568
02:10:18,199 --> 02:10:19,239
We have like our soup.

1569
02:10:19,239 --> 02:10:20,680
Press B before we go.

1570
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,319
Let's kill.

1571
02:10:21,319 --> 02:10:22,520
We have upgraded our health.

1572
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:24,199
Last time we fought this guy,

1573
02:10:24,199 --> 02:10:25,479
didn't we only have like 200 health?

1574
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:29,189
Or would that, am I making that up?

1575
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:30,550
You're making that up.

1576
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:38,020
But we didn't have potions.

1577
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:39,060
We can beat them with potions.

1578
02:10:43,409 --> 02:10:44,289
You ready?

1579
02:10:44,289 --> 02:10:44,770
All right, hold on.

1580
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:46,930
Am I about to press B?

1581
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:47,970
You take everything, right?

1582
02:10:49,829 --> 02:10:50,329
Yeah.

1583
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,199
All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put,

1584
02:10:54,199 --> 02:10:55,800
you know, put your sentry down first.

1585
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:57,479
Did you put one down?

1586
02:10:58,359 --> 02:10:58,859
Yeah.

1587
02:10:59,319 --> 02:11:00,630
Okay.

1588
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:02,449
Pressing B for potions now.

1589
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:04,369
Holy fuck, that's a lot.

1590
02:11:04,369 --> 02:11:05,409
And I gotta eat a hamburger.

1591
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:08,819
All right, I'm ready.

1592
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:11,300
I don't have the thing.

1593
02:11:11,939 --> 02:11:12,439
Oh!

1594
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:17,000
Piggy!

1595
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,300
We only have four minutes of these potions.

1596
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:21,800
What did you do?

1597
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:22,819
I need ebstone blocks.

1598
02:11:22,819 --> 02:11:23,319
What?

1599
02:11:25,079 --> 02:11:26,239
What is it?

1600
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:26,739
Ebstone block.

1601
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,560
What do you mean?

1602
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,600
Do I have any?

1603
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,319
I've got boots.

1604
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:31,359
I'll be quick.

1605
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:32,640
Gonna do something real quick.

1606
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:37,000
Oh, by the way, that was probably like,

1607
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,840
that was probably like nine gold.

1608
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:40,680
I'm gonna get killed, kill Piggy.

1609
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:42,119
They, it lasts for like seven minutes.

1610
02:11:42,119 --> 02:11:42,619
I'll be back.

1611
02:11:42,619 --> 02:11:43,640
No, it doesn't. It lasts for four.

1612
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:46,739
I'll be, dude, it's gonna take like two seconds.

1613
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:51,590
Like I'm already done.

1614
02:11:51,590 --> 02:11:52,789
Like I already have it.

1615
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:54,149
I'm killing the pig.

1616
02:11:55,619 --> 02:11:57,060
Okay, you're putting it to use.

1617
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:01,329
Good thing I took all these potions to get 500 of them.

1618
02:12:01,329 --> 02:12:03,250
Yeah, and I turned them all into blocks.

1619
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:06,050
I need ebstone brick, like the raw form of it.

1620
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,699
I forgot why I went and got them, I think.

1621
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:10,920
Oh wait, no.

1622
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,739
It's the whole thing.

1623
02:12:12,739 --> 02:12:17,970
You know what? Just, just forget about me.

1624
02:12:18,609 --> 02:12:20,609
Forget about me.

1625
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:33,939
You'd be happier if you didn't even know me.

1626
02:12:34,739 --> 02:12:37,539
At least the sentries are still up there.

1627
02:12:37,539 --> 02:12:39,090
Forget about me.

1628
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:41,189
Okay, I'm ready.

1629
02:12:41,189 --> 02:12:42,390
Did we take enough potions again?

1630
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,850
No.

1631
02:12:44,149 --> 02:12:45,510
No, they last four minutes.

1632
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:46,010
Okay.

1633
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:53,079
Oh my god, I have a gravity potion.

1634
02:12:53,079 --> 02:12:54,760
It ate my fucking gravity potion.

1635
02:13:04,689 --> 02:13:05,810
Why am I floating around?

1636
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:10,229
Because you probably also had a featherfall potion like I did.

1637
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:10,949
No, I don't think I did.

1638
02:13:11,909 --> 02:13:44,239
Stop bouncing around on me.

1639
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:44,960
God damn it.

1640
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,550
Ow.

1641
02:13:51,329 --> 02:13:53,329
Ow, they're everywhere.

1642
02:13:53,329 --> 02:13:57,010
I'm gonna die.

1643
02:13:57,729 --> 02:14:07,510
Talk to the nurse if you need to.

1644
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:10,520
I'm dead.

1645
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:11,239
I got juggled.

1646
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:20,000
Oh, gravity potion wore off.

1647
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:23,430
Okay, this is so much harder when I'm not running.

1648
02:14:30,949 --> 02:14:31,449
Oh god.

1649
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,439
Just don't die, just don't die, just don't die.

1650
02:14:37,439 --> 02:14:38,720
It's kind of impossible.

1651
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:39,359
It's impossible.

1652
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,239
It's impossible for me to not die.

1653
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,100
I'm dead.

1654
02:14:46,479 --> 02:14:49,140
Oh my god.

1655
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:50,659
I'm just trying to talk to...

1656
02:14:50,659 --> 02:14:51,460
I can't move.

1657
02:14:56,369 --> 02:14:57,970
No, it's still here.

1658
02:14:57,970 --> 02:14:58,529
It's still here.

1659
02:14:58,529 --> 02:15:02,449
We're like this late in the game and I still don't have a weapon I want to use.

1660
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:03,890
Is it still here?

1661
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:05,270
No.

1662
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:14,180
Germany gets all the fucking good items.

1663
02:15:18,229 --> 02:15:19,989
There's something dropped over here though.

1664
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:23,090
Immunity...

1665
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:24,210
What is a nazar?

1666
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:31,720
Ayaya.

1667
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:32,439
Climb the rope?

1668
02:15:36,899 --> 02:15:39,479
It's harder when you get like hit and you just get juggled.

1669
02:15:40,199 --> 02:15:43,380
What is this thing?

1670
02:15:44,979 --> 02:15:48,609
I have some casualties.

1671
02:15:54,069 --> 02:15:55,189
Make more platforms?

1672
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:59,359
Yeah, we kind of only have this one platform.

1673
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,840
Should we make like two or three other platforms to fall down to and jump to?

1674
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:06,159
Fall down and jump up and...

1675
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:07,920
Because we're really only like one one plane.

1676
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,220
Yeah.

1677
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,279
Okay, do it.

1678
02:16:12,399 --> 02:16:14,079
Was that was all that wood that I bought?

1679
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,600
Yeah, I put it in the storage.

1680
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:17,359
I'm gonna go get a thing real quick.

1681
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:29,800
Do we just have platforms?

1682
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:34,049
The wood just turns into platforms.

1683
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:35,409
It just does, right?

1684
02:16:36,129 --> 02:16:43,569
How much should I have?

1685
02:16:43,569 --> 02:16:44,290
Like a couple hundred?

1686
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:55,600
Yeah, so then we can kind of like jump and fall from plan to plan.

1687
02:16:56,559 --> 02:17:03,040
I think Jerma last stream said building these platforms was cheating.

1688
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:06,100
Did I say that?

1689
02:17:06,819 --> 02:17:07,700
You did.

1690
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:12,930
I don't remember that.

1691
02:17:12,930 --> 02:17:14,209
Okay, so theoretically...

1692
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:17,670
How did you make the...

1693
02:17:18,549 --> 02:17:20,659
How did you do like the little...

1694
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:22,100
It has to be connected to a wall, doesn't it?

1695
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,680
In it?

1696
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:28,260
Yeah, how did you do this though?

1697
02:17:28,260 --> 02:17:29,700
How did you make like the little staircase?

1698
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:32,450
How did you like place the stairs?

1699
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:35,090
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1700
02:17:35,090 --> 02:17:35,809
Oh, there we go.

1701
02:17:36,530 --> 02:17:45,809
All right, so you gotta be like enough to...

1702
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:50,790
Let's see, like that we can jump.

1703
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,829
Like right here.

1704
02:17:52,709 --> 02:17:56,680
Because if I go like this, right there.

1705
02:18:13,159 --> 02:18:15,110
I can clean that up.

1706
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:27,639
Okay, yeah, it seems like you can like jump up.

1707
02:18:27,639 --> 02:18:29,079
Like jump up over here and then up.

1708
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:30,760
There's more...

1709
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:31,959
Because you just can't get away.

1710
02:18:31,959 --> 02:18:33,879
There's just too many things to like have to dodge.

1711
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:35,559
They take up the whole space.

1712
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:38,799
Ralph is here.

1713
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:39,299
Who's Ralph?

1714
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:58,209
Okay, I'm gonna like do...

1715
02:18:58,209 --> 02:18:59,010
I'm gonna make like a...

1716
02:18:59,010 --> 02:18:59,409
Hold on.

1717
02:18:59,409 --> 02:19:01,649
I'm gonna do a bigger arena.

1718
02:19:01,649 --> 02:19:02,209
You go get...

1719
02:19:02,209 --> 02:19:03,489
You do a good thing real quick.

1720
02:19:04,209 --> 02:19:05,760
I'm gonna make like some space.

1721
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:07,200
I got the soul thing for you.

1722
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:08,879
So when we finally get Goblin Man.

1723
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:18,920
I need more of these.

1724
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:29,399
All I do is give.

1725
02:19:29,399 --> 02:19:31,639
All I freaking do is give.

1726
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,639
And what does Jerma do?

1727
02:19:33,639 --> 02:19:34,600
Take, take, take.

1728
02:19:35,239 --> 02:19:39,559
All right, this should be good.

1729
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:46,790
Let's see if he'll laugh.

1730
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:47,920
That's all I can do.

1731
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:51,510
I mean, yeah, because like what are you even talking about?

1732
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:52,549
I'm doing stuff here.

1733
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:55,670
All right, I'm thinking...

1734
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:56,389
Let's do another one.

1735
02:19:57,030 --> 02:20:00,770
We're making an old NES game.

1736
02:20:01,329 --> 02:20:04,450
We're making...

1737
02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:04,930
What's that game?

1738
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:06,610
That like Burger Town game?

1739
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:07,329
Burger Time.

1740
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:08,760
What?

1741
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:19,430
A goblin army is approaching from the east.

1742
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:21,590
We're being invaded.

1743
02:20:22,629 --> 02:20:23,350
Oh.

1744
02:20:23,350 --> 02:20:24,309
Goblin army.

1745
02:20:24,309 --> 02:20:24,469
No.

1746
02:20:29,399 --> 02:20:30,040
Is this like bad?

1747
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,520
Do I have to get over there?

1748
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:31,920
No.

1749
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:32,879
It's like the blood moon.

1750
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:35,459
They just keep coming until you kill enough of them.

1751
02:20:35,459 --> 02:20:35,940
And this is...

1752
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:37,299
We needed this, right?

1753
02:20:37,299 --> 02:20:38,260
Didn't you say we needed this stuff?

1754
02:20:42,899 --> 02:20:43,379
No.

1755
02:20:43,379 --> 02:20:44,020
Okay.

1756
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:48,069
It's so funny that I can look over there and see.

1757
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:50,340
Like exactly...

1758
02:20:50,979 --> 02:20:52,819
You're not even writing the emote.

1759
02:20:57,379 --> 02:21:00,500
Jerma, give me your minotaur skull and your other thing.

1760
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,540
Minotaur skull and the...

1761
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,139
Okay, buddy.

1762
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:06,610
Give them to me.

1763
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:07,649
All right, hold on.

1764
02:21:07,649 --> 02:21:08,129
Geez, I'm kidding.

1765
02:21:08,129 --> 02:21:08,690
Give them.

1766
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:14,209
What an idiot.

1767
02:21:14,209 --> 02:21:14,850
Get robbed.

1768
02:21:17,729 --> 02:21:19,090
I'm a summoner now.

1769
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:27,540
Oh yeah, that's right.

1770
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:28,739
You are the summoner now.

1771
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:35,489
All right, we have a pretty interesting platform now

1772
02:21:35,489 --> 02:21:39,090
to like escape stuff and like drop down and escape that and jump here and...

1773
02:21:48,610 --> 02:21:50,290
All right, I'm gonna pee, okay?

1774
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:53,010
While the goblins invade, he's gonna pee.

1775
02:21:53,250 --> 02:21:53,889
No, fine.

1776
02:21:53,889 --> 02:21:54,850
I won't.

1777
02:21:54,850 --> 02:21:56,950
I thought you said this wasn't a big deal.

1778
02:21:57,829 --> 02:21:59,989
Yeah, but you have to like actually do this one.

1779
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,159
Blood moon just kind of ends.

1780
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:05,600
This one has like a percentage.

1781
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:06,899
Oh.

1782
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:08,639
Is there a boss again?

1783
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:10,000
I would appreciate your help.

1784
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,319
Because all I do is give.

1785
02:22:15,889 --> 02:22:16,850
Just pee my pants.

1786
02:22:18,739 --> 02:22:19,379
Just what?

1787
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:20,579
I said I have...

1788
02:22:20,579 --> 02:22:21,940
Somebody said just pee.

1789
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:22,659
Just like pee your pants.

1790
02:22:22,659 --> 02:22:23,940
Just go to the bathroom.

1791
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,440
Yeah, good.

1792
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:30,760
The thing is, I could do that and no one would know I actually did that.

1793
02:22:31,479 --> 02:22:38,719
I mean, you'd probably tell everyone.

1794
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:44,500
Where's Jerma?

1795
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:45,219
Jerma, I need you.

1796
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:47,700
I'm right here.

1797
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:48,500
Jerma, take this.

1798
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:53,110
It's the thing.

1799
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:53,670
It's the thing.

1800
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:55,430
Oh my god, this is the best birthday ever.

1801
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:56,870
Thank you.

1802
02:22:57,590 --> 02:22:59,250
Hey, no problem.

1803
02:22:59,969 --> 02:23:02,000
All I do is give.

1804
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:05,680
Well, to be fair, you did just take that from me before an invasion.

1805
02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:12,219
Sorry?

1806
02:23:18,739 --> 02:23:21,670
Don't...

1807
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:23,190
Stop comparing this game to Minecraft.

1808
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:24,149
It's way different.

1809
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:28,979
Nobody wrote any of that.

1810
02:23:28,979 --> 02:23:29,299
I just...

1811
02:23:29,299 --> 02:23:31,700
I'm trying just to cause constant conflict in the chat.

1812
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,459
That's usually what I'm doing.

1813
02:23:37,219 --> 02:23:38,100
You need some help?

1814
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:39,459
I can do a better job.

1815
02:23:39,459 --> 02:23:41,780
No, I do not need your help in that.

1816
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:43,059
Oh, because I'm too good?

1817
02:23:43,059 --> 02:23:43,780
No, I...

1818
02:23:43,780 --> 02:23:44,260
We don't...

1819
02:23:44,260 --> 02:23:45,780
We do not need like a...

1820
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:47,940
Like here comes like a hot take from Star.

1821
02:23:48,739 --> 02:23:50,290
I have some pretty good takes.

1822
02:23:50,290 --> 02:23:51,729
No, I don't want any of those takes.

1823
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:56,260
I don't want to hear any of those.

1824
02:23:59,239 --> 02:24:04,579
All right, I guess that's fair.

1825
02:24:05,719 --> 02:24:06,680
I think so too.

1826
02:24:07,399 --> 02:24:08,200
It's pretty fair.

1827
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,989
So this is this you would?

1828
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:16,819
Oh, yeah.

1829
02:24:16,819 --> 02:24:17,940
You don't have to chop it.

1830
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:18,739
They just drop it.

1831
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:20,959
It's really helpful that way.

1832
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:21,600
It's very helpful.

1833
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,040
Or you could plant trees.

1834
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:32,069
Goblin army has been defeated.

1835
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,510
Good job.

1836
02:24:34,389 --> 02:24:35,829
So now what does that do?

1837
02:24:37,379 --> 02:24:40,340
Should hopefully aid in finding this goblin asshole.

1838
02:24:42,709 --> 02:24:44,069
All right, I have to go pee.

1839
02:24:44,069 --> 02:24:45,559
I'll be right back.

1840
02:24:45,559 --> 02:24:47,239
All right, I'm going to go spelunking.

1841
02:24:47,239 --> 02:24:48,600
Everyone on the squad stream,

1842
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:50,200
click over to Star's stream now

1843
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:51,959
because that guy's just going to stand still

1844
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:55,459
and type in my chat.

1845
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:58,979
Like what happened to Hillary's emails?

1846
02:24:58,979 --> 02:25:00,100
What about them?

1847
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:00,979
Hey, don't worry.

1848
02:25:00,979 --> 02:25:01,540
We'll be back.

1849
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:05,319
We can all have like an intelligent discussion

1850
02:25:05,319 --> 02:25:06,040
now that he's gone.

1851
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:07,959
I am absolutely...

1852
02:25:07,959 --> 02:25:09,559
By the way, I'm absolutely...

1853
02:25:09,559 --> 02:25:10,440
I'm gonna cut you.

1854
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:10,760
I'm like...

1855
02:25:11,399 --> 02:25:12,120
He's...

1856
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:12,680
No, it is...

1857
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:13,399
I'm not going to...

1858
02:25:13,399 --> 02:25:15,000
I'm not going to walk away.

1859
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,200
You think I'm going to walk away?

1860
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:16,440
No.

1861
02:25:17,459 --> 02:25:18,659
All right, I'll see you later.

1862
02:25:18,659 --> 02:25:19,780
I'll be back in like two minutes.

1863
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:02,870
Okay.

1864
02:28:04,129 --> 02:28:05,409
I am...

1865
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:08,479
I'm back.

1866
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,799
Hey, how's it going?

1867
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:12,159
How are you?

1868
02:28:12,159 --> 02:28:13,600
Okay, let's go.

1869
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:14,559
What do you say?

1870
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:15,200
What do we do now?

1871
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:23,079
I am looking for the goblin tinker.

1872
02:28:23,079 --> 02:28:23,579
Cool.

1873
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:26,200
That's 100% the priority.

1874
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:28,760
I have popped a hunter potion to see enemies,

1875
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:30,680
which apparently, according to my...

1876
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:33,079
I'm going to continue to build our boss chat room.

1877
02:28:35,479 --> 02:28:38,440
If you want to actually build an insane boss arena...

1878
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:39,159
That's what I'm going to do.

1879
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:46,930
You can make an arena out of minecart tracks.

1880
02:28:47,989 --> 02:28:49,590
And then at the end of a minecart track,

1881
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:51,909
you can change it so you turn and change directions,

1882
02:28:51,909 --> 02:28:55,909
and you can actually make an in-the-air diamond-shaped minecart

1883
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:58,709
that just drives you around in circles.

1884
02:28:58,709 --> 02:28:59,209
Pretty dope.

1885
02:29:00,069 --> 02:29:04,229
All right, I'm going to do one more of these.

1886
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:08,879
If you like having like four,

1887
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:10,719
and then also just in case you fall,

1888
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,239
you know, we need some one down here too.

1889
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,280
This is more for me than it is for you.

1890
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:28,229
Okay.

1891
02:29:28,229 --> 02:29:29,750
People are telling me to get the boots.

1892
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:30,950
Get the boots, get the boots, get the boots.

1893
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:32,790
Should I get the Hermes boots?

1894
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:33,590
Should I just get them?

1895
02:29:39,319 --> 02:29:39,819
Yeah.

1896
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,309
Especially if you don't even know what they do,

1897
02:29:42,309 --> 02:29:47,110
so you need to like experience what they're doing for you.

1898
02:29:48,229 --> 02:29:49,270
I will after I do this.

1899
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:04,149
Watch out, bug.

1900
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:07,139
Or maybe you could wait.

1901
02:30:11,239 --> 02:30:11,959
Actually, I don't know.

1902
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:15,379
He spawned flat ground just off screen.

1903
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:17,799
There we go.

1904
02:30:17,799 --> 02:30:18,760
And then I'm going to do this.

1905
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:32,770
Just in case, you know, a little spot.

1906
02:30:33,569 --> 02:30:49,409
This is fun.

1907
02:30:51,569 --> 02:30:52,610
Enjoying building, you know,

1908
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:54,770
a nice little simple build stream, no pressure.

1909
02:30:55,329 --> 02:30:56,209
This is, yeah, let's just-

1910
02:30:56,209 --> 02:30:57,010
Flip that house.

1911
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:01,780
Make sure you build a roof.

1912
02:31:03,219 --> 02:31:03,700
And-

1913
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:04,180
A roof?

1914
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:04,579
Why would I-

1915
02:31:04,579 --> 02:31:05,379
We need a roof on-

1916
02:31:05,379 --> 02:31:05,860
Here it is.

1917
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:06,579
I found the guy.

1918
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:16,260
And then you're going to want to get some heart statues,

1919
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:18,020
you know, set up the red wire,

1920
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:21,059
and you're like to have the hearts that you shoot out hearts for you.

1921
02:31:21,059 --> 02:31:31,940
All right, that's good.

1922
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,620
Dude, it's Chuboy.

1923
02:31:34,420 --> 02:31:40,180
Someone said don't have the arena that close to the NPCs.

1924
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,379
Yeah, I'll move.

1925
02:31:41,379 --> 02:31:43,940
Like, I'm going to have like another section over here.

1926
02:31:44,659 --> 02:31:46,500
Oh, somebody gives 10 community subs.

1927
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:47,299
Who was it?

1928
02:31:47,299 --> 02:31:48,899
It wasn't me.

1929
02:31:48,899 --> 02:31:51,219
It's a great Canadian FK club.

1930
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:53,639
Thanks for the 10 subs.

1931
02:31:54,879 --> 02:31:55,200
Thank you.

1932
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,239
Sick.

1933
02:31:56,799 --> 02:31:57,680
That's a lot of subs.

1934
02:31:57,680 --> 02:31:58,180
Sick.

1935
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:00,469
No, thank you so much.

1936
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,639
What mods are being used?

1937
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,200
Uh, times 5,000 damage.

1938
02:32:06,709 --> 02:32:08,309
We die instantly, one hit kill.

1939
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:09,989
And permadeath.

1940
02:32:12,819 --> 02:32:15,780
Mean streamer gives sarcastic answer live on Twitch.

1941
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:17,379
Never trust him again.

1942
02:32:18,690 --> 02:32:20,770
I've actually, I really don't, I don't even really know.

1943
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:23,250
He's the mod guy.

1944
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:24,770
He's like, hey, just join my server.

1945
02:32:24,770 --> 02:32:27,649
And it was like exclamation point mod.

1946
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,120
And not Jermis chat.

1947
02:32:33,489 --> 02:32:34,370
It's still mildly inaccurate.

1948
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:35,329
Silly physics.

1949
02:32:36,129 --> 02:32:39,120
Yeah, we have a silly physics mod.

1950
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:52,149
I didn't buy the table.

1951
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:54,260
Yeah.

1952
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,219
He's going to like, I don't know.

1953
02:32:55,219 --> 02:32:56,739
How long does he spend down here?

1954
02:32:56,739 --> 02:32:57,620
He's already up.

1955
02:32:57,620 --> 02:32:58,260
No, he's not.

1956
02:32:59,059 --> 02:33:02,180
I don't have any god dang recall potions.

1957
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:03,780
My life is misery.

1958
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:06,850
Okay.

1959
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:08,610
Oh, now I'm going to do that.

1960
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:10,930
What?

1961
02:33:11,649 --> 02:33:13,780
Stop that.

1962
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:20,719
So now you can just be like, oh, there he's coming down this way.

1963
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:21,280
All right.

1964
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:21,920
They're all up here.

1965
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:22,420
Down.

1966
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:23,360
All right.

1967
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:25,360
Up we go this way.

1968
02:33:26,239 --> 02:33:27,360
They came, they dropped down up.

1969
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:29,649
Okay.

1970
02:33:29,649 --> 02:33:32,100
Jerma, it'll be good.

1971
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:34,549
I don't think I have enough gold.

1972
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:36,719
Not enough gold?

1973
02:33:36,719 --> 02:33:37,600
What do you mean?

1974
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:38,239
You need money?

1975
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:45,989
All right.

1976
02:33:45,989 --> 02:33:46,469
That's enough.

1977
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:49,110
Where do you go to get your swell on?

1978
02:33:49,989 --> 02:33:50,149
What?

1979
02:33:50,149 --> 02:33:52,069
Like, what's your what are your hobbies?

1980
02:33:52,069 --> 02:33:53,430
You have any outdoor activities?

1981
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:55,190
You going outside in Vegas?

1982
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:57,110
There's a lot of beautiful places in Vegas.

1983
02:33:57,110 --> 02:34:02,309
There's a lot of like mountains and trails and yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff.

1984
02:34:02,309 --> 02:34:03,270
But do you go to them?

1985
02:34:03,909 --> 02:34:08,069
Yeah, a couple of times when you have the opportunity.

1986
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:12,000
I'm worried about you.

1987
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,760
I mean, used to be like so in shape and so buff.

1988
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:18,850
I could feel it.

1989
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:20,530
Press B to run.

1990
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:21,889
Nope, that's not going to work.

1991
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:24,290
Okay, he's going to mute Mike again.

1992
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:28,579
Why am I going to mute Mike?

1993
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:31,760
I don't know.

1994
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:33,280
You just don't like talking to me, I guess.

1995
02:34:40,799 --> 02:34:48,440
I want some like, I think I want some more coffee.

1996
02:34:50,739 --> 02:34:51,379
This late?

1997
02:34:53,319 --> 02:34:54,120
Yeah, never mind.

1998
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:54,760
You're right.

1999
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:55,959
This is too late.

2000
02:34:57,079 --> 02:35:00,600
Get some vodka.

2001
02:35:01,319 --> 02:35:04,770
I got too much shit to do.

2002
02:35:05,409 --> 02:35:13,399
And yet you're here playing Terraria.

2003
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:20,899
What does this like hourglass looking dropper you've made?

2004
02:35:20,899 --> 02:35:21,860
It's just like a design.

2005
02:35:22,659 --> 02:35:24,899
Oh, so you're like splicing up our lives out here?

2006
02:35:24,899 --> 02:35:30,100
I mean, yeah, it's just like it's an easy aesthetically pleasing structure.

2007
02:35:31,459 --> 02:35:38,549
Oh, all right.

2008
02:35:39,190 --> 02:35:39,989
This is good, right?

2009
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:44,500
We have a lot of places to go.

2010
02:35:45,139 --> 02:35:50,840
I'm going to do one more down here, but not actually down here.

2011
02:35:51,639 --> 02:36:04,450
Okay, because then it's like, oh, no, I fell off right here.

2012
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:04,930
It's all right.

2013
02:36:05,809 --> 02:36:18,239
All right, now I'm going to go get the boots and put them on.

2014
02:36:18,959 --> 02:36:22,690
Do I have enough money?

2015
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:24,920
Let's find out.

2016
02:36:25,559 --> 02:36:27,000
I'm a boot master.

2017
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,040
I do have enough money.

2018
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:30,319
Harpoon.

2019
02:36:31,959 --> 02:36:32,600
Is this any good?

2020
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:40,899
Not really.

2021
02:36:40,899 --> 02:36:45,299
All right.

2022
02:36:45,299 --> 02:36:46,020
Spike bomb.

2023
02:36:46,579 --> 02:36:46,899
Cool.

2024
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:49,799
This you would I'm just gonna put.

2025
02:36:49,799 --> 02:36:50,200
All right.

2026
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,680
This is like four jumps.

2027
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:55,319
Hey, this, this Nazar.

2028
02:36:56,719 --> 02:36:57,200
What is this?

2029
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,360
It's like equipable immunity to curse.

2030
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:01,920
Like, is this just a material that I'm going to need at some point later?

2031
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:06,159
I don't remember what curse is.

2032
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:08,239
So I don't know.

2033
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:13,940
I think it's like good for a specific boss, but I forget which status is cursed.

2034
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:14,979
Dude, look at this thing.

2035
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:18,229
Look at this thing.

2036
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:21,989
So what do I replace this with?

2037
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:24,389
Well, you know, I know.

2038
02:37:24,389 --> 02:37:24,709
Okay.

2039
02:37:25,750 --> 02:37:29,110
So how many minions can I have now?

2040
02:37:31,219 --> 02:37:36,340
Count them up.

2041
02:37:36,340 --> 02:37:37,700
Max entries, max minions.

2042
02:37:39,989 --> 02:37:42,069
I have another room for another accessory, too.

2043
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:54,200
Is there anything else I should be putting on?

2044
02:37:55,559 --> 02:37:58,180
What's the one that I have the mana one on already?

2045
02:37:58,979 --> 02:38:02,799
20 mana.

2046
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:06,040
Boots.

2047
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:08,280
One of the boots of boots, though, aren't they?

2048
02:38:09,239 --> 02:38:10,360
Or boots.

2049
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:11,559
The boots are new boots.

2050
02:38:11,559 --> 02:38:12,680
They're not an accessory, right?

2051
02:38:13,799 --> 02:38:19,000
You can buy the Hermes boots and buy the rocket boots off the tinker and combine them to make

2052
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:21,079
runny, jumpy boots.

2053
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:29,219
Spectre boots.

2054
02:38:29,219 --> 02:38:29,860
Yeah.

2055
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:32,340
But can I put this on?

2056
02:38:33,139 --> 02:38:37,670
Oh, this is where it gets tricky for me.

2057
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:44,079
The boots are an accessory, they're not actual boots.

2058
02:38:44,719 --> 02:38:47,250
Well, I'm going to go get them.

2059
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:49,590
Is that guy still on the roof or did you lock him in something?

2060
02:38:50,469 --> 02:38:55,829
A cobbler?

2061
02:38:55,829 --> 02:38:57,350
He should be in one of these rooms.

2062
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:58,389
He's on the final room.

2063
02:38:59,110 --> 02:39:04,719
Oh, I don't have the Bank of fucking America mod.

2064
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,000
I don't know.

2065
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:09,760
I'm having Deja vu.

2066
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:10,719
What is that?

2067
02:39:10,719 --> 02:39:17,319
I want to go find ice skates.

2068
02:39:19,559 --> 02:39:20,280
Do we have one?

2069
02:39:23,399 --> 02:39:23,719
All right.

2070
02:39:23,719 --> 02:39:24,440
Hermes boots.

2071
02:39:25,239 --> 02:39:26,180
I own them.

2072
02:39:35,079 --> 02:39:35,399
Wow.

2073
02:39:35,959 --> 02:39:37,079
Those are fun.

2074
02:39:37,799 --> 02:39:41,600
Oh shit, you can.

2075
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,719
How do I get out of here?

2076
02:39:42,719 --> 02:39:43,219
Wow.

2077
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:55,829
You are stuck.

2078
02:39:56,469 --> 02:39:58,870
Please rebuild that wall, though, because that'll stop being a house.

2079
02:40:06,319 --> 02:40:08,159
It'll stop being a house.

2080
02:40:08,959 --> 02:40:09,280
Yeah.

2081
02:40:11,350 --> 02:40:14,659
It's just standard wood to do that, right?

2082
02:40:14,659 --> 02:40:18,870
The wood that you just destroyed, you just picked up because you destroyed it.

2083
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:19,510
So you have it.

2084
02:40:25,809 --> 02:40:27,170
I didn't know how that worked.

2085
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:28,049
I didn't know if it fell.

2086
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:35,909
All right.

2087
02:40:35,909 --> 02:40:36,229
Cool.

2088
02:40:36,229 --> 02:40:36,709
Nice hook.

2089
02:40:38,149 --> 02:40:38,549
Cool.

2090
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:41,270
So now I have the boots.

2091
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:42,950
I have that cool new item.

2092
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:48,020
Let me see what I got now for, you know, stuff.

2093
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:51,059
Get the rocket boots, rocket boots, rocket boots.

2094
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:54,100
I think the tinker is still in the cave.

2095
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:57,379
Yeah, I would just wait for him to appear, which will just be a while.

2096
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:00,340
I think we might have to like leave this area and come back.

2097
02:41:02,530 --> 02:41:03,170
Okay.

2098
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:10,690
Well, this is just a healing potion, 100 life versus 50 life.

2099
02:41:11,409 --> 02:41:16,530
How do I make it so does it do the better ones first when you press H?

2100
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:17,489
I think so.

2101
02:41:24,739 --> 02:41:26,260
Oh, requires an ice machine.

2102
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:26,659
Okay.

2103
02:41:26,659 --> 02:41:27,540
I knew it was something.

2104
02:41:29,860 --> 02:41:32,180
Get, get the sans head from the chest.

2105
02:41:33,139 --> 02:41:33,459
Hold on.

2106
02:41:33,459 --> 02:41:35,139
Let me like just go over what I need to like.

2107
02:41:35,139 --> 02:41:36,500
I just got this new item and shit.

2108
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:46,930
So now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2109
02:41:46,930 --> 02:41:47,250
No, no, no.

2110
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:47,649
Holy shit.

2111
02:41:47,649 --> 02:41:48,129
I'm an idiot.

2112
02:41:49,090 --> 02:41:50,450
I was like, no way.

2113
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:52,690
I was like, wow, keep going.

2114
02:41:52,690 --> 02:41:53,729
They just keep spawning.

2115
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:55,729
You'll get that many later though.

2116
02:41:58,799 --> 02:42:02,709
Two centuries and five of these.

2117
02:42:06,149 --> 02:42:09,219
All right.

2118
02:42:09,219 --> 02:42:11,379
So now this, what is this?

2119
02:42:11,379 --> 02:42:12,899
This thing, 28 magic damage.

2120
02:42:16,389 --> 02:42:17,110
Storm cloud.

2121
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:18,790
I feel like I'm not using this at all.

2122
02:42:20,239 --> 02:42:21,200
19 magic damage.

2123
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,280
It looks cool, but I'm not using it.

2124
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:25,120
What about us we have?

2125
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:30,260
Do I just drop those?

2126
02:42:32,469 --> 02:42:33,350
Do we?

2127
02:42:33,350 --> 02:42:37,139
I think I have to use the fucking sans head.

2128
02:42:40,899 --> 02:42:42,260
Would that be so bad?

2129
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:44,100
No, I mean, I just don't like using it.

2130
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:45,409
This is the day.

2131
02:42:45,409 --> 02:42:46,450
Why don't you like it?

2132
02:42:47,969 --> 02:42:51,000
I've given you everything, Jerma.

2133
02:42:51,639 --> 02:42:55,510
What's wrong?

2134
02:42:55,909 --> 02:42:59,350
Get the, do you think I was literally born yesterday?

2135
02:43:07,409 --> 02:43:08,129
I'm going to set you.

2136
02:43:08,129 --> 02:43:08,610
Oh yeah.

2137
02:43:10,049 --> 02:43:10,610
What's that?

2138
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:19,219
Okay.

2139
02:43:19,219 --> 02:43:22,020
I think I have my gear that I want.

2140
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:27,280
Okay.

2141
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:28,319
Got my stuff.

2142
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:31,559
I'm going to be able to have another one of these.

2143
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:38,200
Minions, mana regen, life regen, defense, and movement speed.

2144
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,360
Is what happens when I press B.

2145
02:43:41,319 --> 02:43:43,840
So that means I can have a sixth minion.

2146
02:43:44,559 --> 02:43:54,600
We have our arena over here that is being, it's not just one plane.

2147
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:55,559
You can run around.

2148
02:43:55,559 --> 02:43:57,879
Should I put torches around every, up here?

2149
02:44:02,229 --> 02:44:03,510
I'd put campfires.

2150
02:44:03,510 --> 02:44:04,389
Campfires.

2151
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:07,200
I don't know how to even make them.

2152
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:10,319
Which is wood and torches.

2153
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:11,440
Oh, okay.

2154
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:15,680
I guess campfires give health regeneration.

2155
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:17,200
How many should I just put them everywhere?

2156
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:21,159
I guess.

2157
02:44:21,879 --> 02:44:24,120
Just fucking just have campfires everywhere.

2158
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:25,639
Yeah, sure.

2159
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:26,840
All right.

2160
02:44:27,559 --> 02:44:38,600
For 10 or 15 spaces.

2161
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:39,159
Wow.

2162
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:40,840
That's not specific at all.

2163
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:41,159
Oh yeah.

2164
02:44:41,159 --> 02:44:42,040
We have a star fury.

2165
02:44:45,319 --> 02:44:45,799
Hold on.

2166
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:53,399
We need those.

2167
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:56,040
But we basically can make it.

2168
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:56,600
God damn it.

2169
02:44:56,600 --> 02:45:00,280
I'd like the last time I played Terraria, I did a run with this weapon

2170
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:02,920
and I don't want to do the same thing again, but it's such a good weapon.

2171
02:45:03,799 --> 02:45:08,020
Am I not picking those up?

2172
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:14,600
No, wait.

2173
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:16,100
Okay.

2174
02:45:16,739 --> 02:45:18,879
That was a yawn voice.

2175
02:45:20,559 --> 02:45:20,959
It was.

2176
02:45:22,079 --> 02:45:28,319
Last time I played this game, I used this weapon and I literally wanted to do it again.

2177
02:45:30,579 --> 02:45:32,100
I'm sorry that I'm boring you.

2178
02:45:41,750 --> 02:45:42,229
Do that again.

2179
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:45,620
No, don't do it that fast.

2180
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:50,819
Do it like every, like, do it like every one or do it every like two or three seconds.

2181
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:52,870
Good.

2182
02:45:52,870 --> 02:45:53,350
Keep going.

2183
02:45:53,350 --> 02:46:00,879
Okay.

2184
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:02,000
That's that's great.

2185
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:09,459
That's that's great.

2186
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:17,040
That's just wow.

2187
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:22,639
That's great.

2188
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:23,200
All right.

2189
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:24,879
There's a lot of fires up here.

2190
02:46:30,579 --> 02:46:31,139
I love these.

2191
02:46:34,079 --> 02:46:34,399
Okay.

2192
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:36,559
Here's what we're going to do.

2193
02:46:36,559 --> 02:46:36,799
Yep.

2194
02:46:37,829 --> 02:46:39,909
We're going to fight this thing one more time.

2195
02:46:39,909 --> 02:46:40,469
Okay.

2196
02:46:40,469 --> 02:46:40,790
Hold on.

2197
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:41,350
Let me just do.

2198
02:46:42,309 --> 02:46:43,430
Oh, stop hitting me.

2199
02:46:44,149 --> 02:46:44,950
There's a rope here.

2200
02:46:49,489 --> 02:46:52,370
Should I do like a Donkey Kong tropical breeze?

2201
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:55,329
Whatever the name of that game is and have like vines to like climb on?

2202
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:02,549
Probably not.

2203
02:47:02,549 --> 02:47:05,350
If they like hit you while you're on a vine, you get released.

2204
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:06,149
Unless we can.

2205
02:47:06,149 --> 02:47:08,069
I think you can craft cobalt shields in this.

2206
02:47:08,069 --> 02:47:09,430
That would actually be really helpful.

2207
02:47:10,149 --> 02:47:11,030
I don't know how to do it.

2208
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:16,440
They're saying hang heart lanterns.

2209
02:47:17,079 --> 02:47:24,049
Yeah, just because you like get like, you know what I'm saying?

2210
02:47:24,049 --> 02:47:25,729
Jump, jump, jump like from vine to vine.

2211
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:33,409
You're going to try and do that during the fight and you think you want it, but you don't.

2212
02:47:33,409 --> 02:47:35,250
But what if, but just what if there's a reason?

2213
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:36,049
What if it happens?

2214
02:47:36,049 --> 02:47:37,090
What if you just fight?

2215
02:47:37,090 --> 02:47:39,170
What if, what if you just have a scenario where that works?

2216
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:42,659
You think you want it.

2217
02:47:45,059 --> 02:47:45,540
All right.

2218
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:48,850
So I think we have a decent area here.

2219
02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:02,690
But you don't.

2220
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:03,329
Here, take this.

2221
02:48:03,329 --> 02:48:03,809
I don't want it.

2222
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:19,989
Glass.

2223
02:48:19,989 --> 02:48:22,469
I don't want to make glass, dude.

2224
02:48:22,469 --> 02:48:24,229
But I like need to really bad.

2225
02:48:25,190 --> 02:48:50,680
So, um, chat is, you wouldn't, you're making fun of me for like doing,

2226
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:53,399
like picking up shitty stuff.

2227
02:48:53,399 --> 02:48:56,520
But somebody said they were watching the other stream

2228
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:59,799
and they're saying that you, your inventory looks fucking stupid right now.

2229
02:49:00,680 --> 02:49:01,639
Like it's being spammed.

2230
02:49:03,059 --> 02:49:03,299
What?

2231
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:08,739
You're like, oh, you pick it up like dumb shit, like stuff we don't need.

2232
02:49:08,739 --> 02:49:10,659
And there's somebody saying that you're in your inventory.

2233
02:49:10,659 --> 02:49:12,979
You have like a bunch of trash.

2234
02:49:12,979 --> 02:49:13,540
Is this true?

2235
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:16,930
I mean, like one or two things.

2236
02:49:16,930 --> 02:49:17,329
What is it?

2237
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:21,139
It's not a big deal.

2238
02:49:21,139 --> 02:49:22,180
What do you have in your inventory?

2239
02:49:22,180 --> 02:49:23,379
That's like, so there's such a problem.

2240
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:27,829
Throwing knives, jester arrows.

2241
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:33,959
Why do you have jester arrows?

2242
02:49:33,959 --> 02:49:35,479
Because I picked them up.

2243
02:49:38,719 --> 02:49:39,760
Want to fight about it?

2244
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:45,040
I forgot what I was looking for here.

2245
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:47,840
Wait, does he have like auto trash?

2246
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:54,559
Nobody said that drama making shit up constant conflict.

2247
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:59,670
I was taking stuff out of the, I was taking stuff out of our bank and throwing it at you.

2248
02:50:00,309 --> 02:50:03,719
And I think I might've just deleted a bunch of stuff because you have it on auto delete.

2249
02:50:06,069 --> 02:50:07,040
What?

2250
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:10,879
I've been throwing shit at you while you were staring at like nothing.

2251
02:50:10,879 --> 02:50:11,600
Oh yeah.

2252
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:13,760
Then I was probably just fucking deleting it.

2253
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:16,319
If you're throwing like really stupid shit at me.

2254
02:50:18,549 --> 02:50:19,670
Like, what did you throw at me?

2255
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:20,389
I don't remember.

2256
02:50:20,389 --> 02:50:23,190
It might've been, there was a magnum.

2257
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:24,549
You threw magnum rounds at me?

2258
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:27,590
Like, I know you don't need them.

2259
02:50:31,190 --> 02:50:32,149
Flaming arrows.

2260
02:50:32,149 --> 02:50:34,469
Like, okay, let's fight this fucking boss.

2261
02:50:34,469 --> 02:50:35,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2262
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:35,829
Get ready for it.

2263
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,120
Wait, I need, I need those.

2264
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:40,399
I gave you something.

2265
02:50:40,399 --> 02:50:40,879
I need them back.

2266
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,399
What do you need?

2267
02:50:42,399 --> 02:50:42,879
I don't know.

2268
02:50:42,879 --> 02:50:43,840
The thing that shoots the bee.

2269
02:50:44,479 --> 02:50:45,350
The bee gun.

2270
02:50:45,989 --> 02:50:49,329
I gave you like ammo.

2271
02:50:49,329 --> 02:50:50,129
Wooden arrows.

2272
02:50:52,610 --> 02:50:54,370
You gave me 500 wooden arrows.

2273
02:50:54,370 --> 02:50:54,930
Here you go.

2274
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:56,129
Here's your trash bag.

2275
02:50:56,129 --> 02:50:56,610
Thank you.

2276
02:50:57,809 --> 02:50:58,209
Okay.

2277
02:50:58,209 --> 02:50:58,850
All right.

2278
02:50:58,850 --> 02:50:59,729
Touch this.

2279
02:51:03,940 --> 02:51:04,260
Hold on.

2280
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:05,139
I need to get this.

2281
02:51:07,459 --> 02:51:10,579
So we're doing the same thing.

2282
02:51:11,780 --> 02:51:12,979
I'm just touch the thing.

2283
02:51:13,860 --> 02:51:16,719
I'm going to spawn all my friends.

2284
02:51:16,719 --> 02:51:19,360
Just let me know when you are ready to do this.

2285
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:22,469
Do that thing.

2286
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:23,670
Okay.

2287
02:51:27,059 --> 02:51:27,860
I'm ready.

2288
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,440
Okay, let's go.

2289
02:51:30,319 --> 02:52:04,200
I mean, is this kind of cheating if you just build platforms?

2290
02:52:37,559 --> 02:52:39,159
Is this like cheating?

2291
02:52:39,159 --> 02:52:39,479
Stop.

2292
02:52:40,040 --> 02:52:41,399
I'm concentrating.

2293
02:52:41,399 --> 02:52:48,340
But it's cheating though, right?

2294
02:52:48,899 --> 02:52:50,340
Stop it.

2295
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:56,309
Can we do it?

2296
02:52:59,430 --> 02:52:59,750
Shell.

2297
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:00,309
Oh, what was that?

2298
02:53:00,309 --> 02:53:01,350
That was huge.

2299
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:02,450
That was all the-

2300
02:53:02,450 --> 02:53:03,170
Slime god.

2301
02:53:05,030 --> 02:53:05,510
Oh, yeah.

2302
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:06,790
Gives you this stupid item.

2303
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:09,430
It's going to give you a place in your inventory

2304
02:53:09,430 --> 02:53:12,069
that like permanently makes you slippery.

2305
02:53:12,069 --> 02:53:13,670
Oh, yeah.

2306
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:14,549
I hate this.

2307
02:53:14,549 --> 02:53:15,350
How do I get rid of this?

2308
02:53:16,069 --> 02:53:16,790
You just delete it.

2309
02:53:18,709 --> 02:53:19,809
Get rid of that.

2310
02:53:19,809 --> 02:53:20,450
But what does it-

2311
02:53:21,090 --> 02:53:23,409
He gives purified gel, which is a crafting thing.

2312
02:53:23,889 --> 02:53:26,129
Some stuff.

2313
02:53:26,129 --> 02:53:27,010
But should we-

2314
02:53:27,010 --> 02:53:29,489
Does this have any purpose at all?

2315
02:53:29,489 --> 02:53:29,969
No.

2316
02:53:29,969 --> 02:53:30,209
None.

2317
02:53:35,250 --> 02:53:37,010
Don't even put this in the-

2318
02:53:37,010 --> 02:53:37,729
Just throw it away.

2319
02:53:37,729 --> 02:53:38,129
No.

2320
02:53:38,129 --> 02:53:41,840
Because are you ever going to want to slide around?

2321
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:44,399
I mean, can I slide around and do like a thousand damage a second?

2322
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:45,760
No.

2323
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:49,879
All right, I threw it away.

2324
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:53,059
You're going to slide into my DMs though.

2325
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:00,479
What?

2326
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:08,420
A frog leg.

2327
02:54:09,059 --> 02:54:11,590
All right, what are-

2328
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:21,760
Okay, a long time ago, you told me about this weapon, this Arcalis.

2329
02:54:23,079 --> 02:54:23,239
Yeah.

2330
02:54:23,239 --> 02:54:25,000
And oh, you can turn it into something eventually.

2331
02:54:25,799 --> 02:54:26,520
Yes.

2332
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:28,760
We need to be in hard mode to finish it.

2333
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:29,260
Okay.

2334
02:54:30,610 --> 02:54:32,450
It is a really, really, really good weapon though.

2335
02:54:32,450 --> 02:54:34,049
But we would just need to kill wall of flesh

2336
02:54:34,049 --> 02:54:35,250
and then we could basically build it.

2337
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:37,920
Okay.

2338
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,600
He put the slime god shit in the chest.

2339
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:42,000
What shit?

2340
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:42,559
What did you do?

2341
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:45,840
Well, what a bunch of fucking tattletales.

2342
02:54:47,569 --> 02:54:47,889
Really?

2343
02:54:49,219 --> 02:54:50,579
Am I being pranked right now?

2344
02:54:50,579 --> 02:54:51,219
No, I just-

2345
02:54:51,219 --> 02:54:54,739
I put the slime god thing in the box to save it in case-

2346
02:54:54,739 --> 02:54:56,180
just in case we wanted it.

2347
02:54:57,299 --> 02:54:58,899
And everybody ran-

2348
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:00,819
No, it's not.

2349
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:03,649
What if we want to use it?

2350
02:55:03,649 --> 02:55:05,329
He put it in the box.

2351
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:11,909
This is why we shouldn't be squad streaming right now.

2352
02:55:14,069 --> 02:55:15,590
You know what? Communication is key.

2353
02:55:16,469 --> 02:55:17,750
Eventually it all comes out.

2354
02:55:17,750 --> 02:55:19,989
Somebody said get carnage.

2355
02:55:20,629 --> 02:55:22,629
Carnage?

2356
02:55:24,709 --> 02:55:27,430
Carnage is a sword that I have.

2357
02:55:27,430 --> 02:55:28,229
Oh, you have it.

2358
02:55:29,190 --> 02:55:30,309
Why? Does it make something?

2359
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:32,389
Get carnage from storage.

2360
02:55:33,809 --> 02:55:34,850
No, I have it.

2361
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:37,239
Why do you need it?

2362
02:55:37,239 --> 02:55:37,639
I don't know.

2363
02:55:37,639 --> 02:55:39,559
Somebody just wrote in all caps like, get it.

2364
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:41,559
Okay, well ignore that guy.

2365
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:43,399
I don't know.

2366
02:55:43,399 --> 02:55:45,239
I'm just- people have thrown out ideas.

2367
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:51,760
He reads the one guy that says carnage,

2368
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:54,239
but not the spam for the rocket boots.

2369
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:56,469
I can't even make the rocket boots

2370
02:55:56,469 --> 02:55:57,909
because the goblin isn't up here.

2371
02:55:57,909 --> 02:55:58,229
Is he?

2372
02:55:59,809 --> 02:56:00,610
Oh, he's up here now.

2373
02:56:00,610 --> 02:56:02,850
He's this blue guy in a-

2374
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:04,850
So I can do it now.

2375
02:56:04,850 --> 02:56:06,049
I couldn't do it before.

2376
02:56:06,049 --> 02:56:07,170
I would have to go-

2377
02:56:07,170 --> 02:56:08,450
There was a reason why I've been waiting.

2378
02:56:09,250 --> 02:56:10,659
It's a reforge, right?

2379
02:56:13,889 --> 02:56:16,370
No, reforge is to reforge the random stat.

2380
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:17,569
What you're doing is shopping.

2381
02:56:17,569 --> 02:56:19,250
Because he has rocket boots.

2382
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:20,290
Allows flight.

2383
02:56:20,290 --> 02:56:22,049
And then I combine the rocket boots

2384
02:56:22,049 --> 02:56:24,530
and the Hermes boots.

2385
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:27,170
This table right here is the combining table

2386
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:28,530
that you're standing in front of right now.

2387
02:56:29,569 --> 02:56:30,930
You can combine rocket boots

2388
02:56:30,930 --> 02:56:32,610
and Hermes boots to make specter boots.

2389
02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:36,610
And then I think you can combine

2390
02:56:36,610 --> 02:56:38,450
specter boots and Zephyr,

2391
02:56:38,450 --> 02:56:40,850
which I will give you even though I was using it.

2392
02:56:42,049 --> 02:56:43,409
And then you can make lightning boots.

2393
02:56:43,409 --> 02:56:45,569
The warican runs super fast.

2394
02:56:45,569 --> 02:56:47,250
So I've got Hermes boots, rocket boots,

2395
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:48,930
specter boots, and then specter boots

2396
02:56:48,930 --> 02:56:51,170
and whatever you just threw to me

2397
02:56:51,889 --> 02:56:52,370
makes another one.

2398
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:53,329
Makes lightning boots.

2399
02:56:57,139 --> 02:57:01,090
Okay, lightning boots.

2400
02:57:01,809 --> 02:57:05,010
Allows flight, the warican run incredibly fast.

2401
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:08,399
Wow, this is cool.

2402
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:09,520
All right, let's go.

2403
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:11,280
And then the next thing that I did, I-

2404
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:13,680
What? You need to also get some shit

2405
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:15,360
to make frostbark boots.

2406
02:57:18,469 --> 02:57:19,350
It just keeps going.

2407
02:57:19,350 --> 02:57:22,469
Is this monster hunter or is this terraria?

2408
02:57:23,860 --> 02:57:25,219
A bit of both.

2409
02:57:25,219 --> 02:57:25,940
Holy shit.

2410
02:57:33,079 --> 02:57:35,649
I could, how much?

2411
02:57:35,649 --> 02:57:37,010
They're like little bunny slippers.

2412
02:57:39,059 --> 02:57:40,020
That's the takeaway.

2413
02:57:40,020 --> 02:57:41,459
They're bunny slippers.

2414
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:45,110
Oh, this is like, this is great.

2415
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:46,549
Oh, are you talking about carnage ray?

2416
02:57:46,549 --> 02:57:47,350
The like staff?

2417
02:57:47,989 --> 02:57:55,799
We could probably make that.

2418
02:57:55,799 --> 02:57:56,920
I think we have most of this.

2419
02:57:57,559 --> 02:57:59,090
I'm too lazy.

2420
02:57:59,090 --> 02:58:01,090
That's, yeah, this is not that fast though.

2421
02:58:04,229 --> 02:58:06,149
I mean, it has to, it queues up

2422
02:58:06,149 --> 02:58:07,989
and you go, you have to be running

2423
02:58:07,989 --> 02:58:09,110
for a while for this to work.

2424
02:58:12,450 --> 02:58:14,209
Yeah, if you use your grappling hook,

2425
02:58:14,209 --> 02:58:15,569
you instantly get to run speed.

2426
02:58:15,569 --> 02:58:16,209
Oh, really?

2427
02:58:17,090 --> 02:58:18,229
Okay.

2428
02:58:18,229 --> 02:58:19,190
I didn't know that.

2429
02:58:19,190 --> 02:58:19,909
Let me test that.

2430
02:58:20,629 --> 02:58:26,930
Perfectly on the ground.

2431
02:58:27,489 --> 02:58:30,870
All right, so we're walking,

2432
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:32,069
we're walking, we're walking.

2433
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:36,639
Oh dude, this is actually probably what

2434
02:58:36,639 --> 02:58:37,680
you should be making.

2435
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:38,719
This would be very good.

2436
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:40,239
I see.

2437
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:40,739
Okay.

2438
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:47,270
You gotta release the hook first, too.

2439
02:58:47,909 --> 02:58:48,549
All right, I get it.

2440
02:58:48,549 --> 02:58:49,670
Oh, goo bow.

2441
02:58:53,649 --> 02:58:55,329
So, ah, these are cool.

2442
02:58:58,719 --> 02:58:59,920
Hey, why'd you even kill that boar?

2443
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:01,040
There was no reason to kill that boar.

2444
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:08,950
Here we go.

2445
02:59:11,909 --> 02:59:12,709
Oh, that's so fun.

2446
02:59:13,430 --> 02:59:27,040
I wasn't making a joke.

2447
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:29,040
I was just wanting to say, here we go.

2448
02:59:30,079 --> 02:59:33,000
All right, what do you want to do?

2449
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:36,319
One second, I'm reading something.

2450
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:38,799
Oh, and we kind of need hell stone,

2451
02:59:38,799 --> 02:59:40,399
but also we can kind of just honestly

2452
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:41,840
skip a lot of this if we just kill

2453
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:42,639
the wall of flesh.

2454
02:59:43,440 --> 02:59:46,049
What else can this be turned into?

2455
02:59:47,989 --> 02:59:50,149
Frost spark boots, lightning boots,

2456
02:59:50,149 --> 02:59:50,950
and ice skates.

2457
02:59:51,670 --> 02:59:55,680
Okay, allows flight super fast running

2458
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,040
and extra mobility on ice,

2459
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:58,479
seven percent increase movement speed.

2460
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:00,950
What do you get the ice gate?

2461
03:00:03,479 --> 03:00:05,799
You can make ice skates out of leather

2462
03:00:05,799 --> 03:00:06,680
and ice blocks.

2463
03:00:07,399 --> 03:00:09,489
Leather and ice blocks.

2464
03:00:10,370 --> 03:00:19,219
Okay, without these on,

2465
03:00:19,780 --> 03:00:21,700
I don't think I would play the game.

2466
03:00:21,700 --> 03:00:23,219
I'm just realizing how slow that is.

2467
03:00:24,100 --> 03:00:25,940
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

2468
03:00:28,899 --> 03:00:31,700
Wow, it doesn't feel like an immediate,

2469
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:32,340
it is.

2470
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:32,979
That's huge.

2471
03:00:36,979 --> 03:00:38,020
You can never go back now.

2472
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:41,959
There's a couple things we can do.

2473
03:00:41,959 --> 03:00:43,399
Like, because we killed that boss,

2474
03:00:43,399 --> 03:00:45,159
we have a material that can make

2475
03:00:45,159 --> 03:00:47,079
a bunch of stuff and a lot of it's good.

2476
03:00:47,719 --> 03:01:16,870
Yeah, my internet's not not up.

2477
03:01:21,799 --> 03:01:22,840
That was weird.

2478
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:24,600
No, my internet's like not my internet's fine.

2479
03:01:26,579 --> 03:01:27,700
That wasn't like my internet.

2480
03:01:28,340 --> 03:01:30,040
That was weird.

2481
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:33,299
Was it?

2482
03:01:33,299 --> 03:01:34,260
It's Twitch.

2483
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:37,120
Oh, not my Twitch.

2484
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:41,510
It was Twitch's fault.

2485
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:44,069
Oh, maybe the server like ingest servers.

2486
03:01:44,950 --> 03:01:46,069
Not my Twitch.

2487
03:01:46,069 --> 03:01:47,750
Twitch took manual control.

2488
03:01:47,750 --> 03:01:48,629
All right, well, you guys.

2489
03:01:51,409 --> 03:01:51,809
I didn't try.

2490
03:01:51,809 --> 03:01:53,010
I didn't leave the game, right?

2491
03:01:53,010 --> 03:01:53,969
Like my internet.

2492
03:01:53,969 --> 03:01:54,690
I was still in the game.

2493
03:01:55,170 --> 03:01:55,889
I don't think you did.

2494
03:01:55,889 --> 03:01:57,170
But usually, I mean, it takes a while

2495
03:01:57,170 --> 03:01:58,209
if you're going to drop.

2496
03:01:58,209 --> 03:02:01,969
I just assumed you're like basically gone.

2497
03:02:02,850 --> 03:02:03,809
But I think you're still here.

2498
03:02:04,610 --> 03:02:06,450
I guess it was just a weird like

2499
03:02:06,450 --> 03:02:07,489
server issue or something.

2500
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:09,489
But we're here.

2501
03:02:09,489 --> 03:02:10,049
What do you want to do?

2502
03:02:12,309 --> 03:02:13,829
I really want to make a bow.

2503
03:02:13,829 --> 03:02:14,950
I need some hellstone.

2504
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:16,549
You can help me mine hellstone

2505
03:02:16,549 --> 03:02:17,989
and then we can kill the wall of flesh.

2506
03:02:18,629 --> 03:02:19,190
OK.

2507
03:02:19,190 --> 03:02:20,790
I don't know if that sounds like a plan.

2508
03:02:20,790 --> 03:02:23,190
Hellstone is a huge pain in the ass to mine.

2509
03:02:23,190 --> 03:02:25,350
Hellstone, I'm remembering.

2510
03:02:27,170 --> 03:02:29,010
And I didn't get an obsidian potion.

2511
03:02:29,010 --> 03:02:30,530
You should buy an obsidian potion.

2512
03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:32,049
Buy an obsidian potion.

2513
03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:38,850
Yeah, which is what I should have done.

2514
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:41,010
But I can't return because I don't have a fucking mirror.

2515
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:41,649
Do we have any?

2516
03:02:43,940 --> 03:02:44,739
We might.

2517
03:02:44,739 --> 03:02:46,899
But I mean, the potion seller will sell them.

2518
03:02:46,899 --> 03:02:48,500
Oh, potion seller?

2519
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:51,940
Give me your finest potion.

2520
03:02:52,739 --> 03:02:53,540
I wasn't going to do it.

2521
03:02:53,540 --> 03:02:54,020
Oh, my God.

2522
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:55,139
I wasn't going to do it.

2523
03:02:55,139 --> 03:02:55,860
Oh, man.

2524
03:02:55,860 --> 03:02:56,100
Yeah.

2525
03:02:56,979 --> 03:02:57,620
How many do you want?

2526
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:00,799
Bring me one.

2527
03:03:00,799 --> 03:03:02,719
So bring like two or four.

2528
03:03:04,739 --> 03:03:10,440
I can afford three obsidian skin potion, right?

2529
03:03:11,239 --> 03:03:11,959
Yep.

2530
03:03:11,959 --> 03:03:13,079
Just make sure I got the right thing.

2531
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:14,659
All right.

2532
03:03:15,459 --> 03:03:17,059
Do we have any of those wormhole potions?

2533
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:19,959
I don't think I have any.

2534
03:03:20,840 --> 03:03:22,360
You can buy some from that guy as well.

2535
03:03:23,079 --> 03:03:23,719
Oh, OK.

2536
03:03:23,719 --> 03:03:24,280
I'll get some.

2537
03:03:25,079 --> 03:03:30,950
Let me buy a couple of those.

2538
03:03:34,559 --> 03:03:35,200
Wormhole.

2539
03:03:36,639 --> 03:03:37,700
There they are.

2540
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:41,319
All right.

2541
03:03:41,319 --> 03:03:44,520
I am going to teleport to you in just a few seconds.

2542
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:45,399
Just a few moments.

2543
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:47,239
I'm bracing myself.

2544
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:49,479
I'm standing over lava.

2545
03:03:49,479 --> 03:03:50,280
In a moment.

2546
03:03:51,079 --> 03:03:51,319
OK.

2547
03:03:51,319 --> 03:03:51,879
So get some.

2548
03:03:51,879 --> 03:03:52,440
We're safe.

2549
03:03:53,159 --> 03:03:53,719
I'm safe.

2550
03:03:53,719 --> 03:03:54,280
You were safe?

2551
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:55,319
Yes.

2552
03:03:55,959 --> 03:03:56,280
OK.

2553
03:04:01,170 --> 03:04:02,049
Where the fuck are you?

2554
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:03,889
Oh, here we go.

2555
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:06,659
I have brought.

2556
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:09,459
Excuse me.

2557
03:04:09,459 --> 03:04:09,700
Hey.

2558
03:04:10,340 --> 03:04:11,139
I have brought you.

2559
03:04:12,739 --> 03:04:13,940
I'm going to drink one of these, right?

2560
03:04:14,659 --> 03:04:15,299
OK.

2561
03:04:15,299 --> 03:04:16,260
And then you can do that.

2562
03:04:17,559 --> 03:04:17,959
Here you go.

2563
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:20,260
Oh, fuck.

2564
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:23,670
How do I throw it?

2565
03:04:24,389 --> 03:04:24,950
Right click.

2566
03:04:26,479 --> 03:04:26,799
OK.

2567
03:04:31,889 --> 03:04:32,370
OK.

2568
03:04:32,370 --> 03:04:35,090
So Hellstone is these rocks down here.

2569
03:04:35,809 --> 03:04:38,049
If you stand on them, even with obsidian potion,

2570
03:04:38,049 --> 03:04:39,170
you'll still take damage.

2571
03:04:40,629 --> 03:04:41,909
And it won't make any noise.

2572
03:04:41,909 --> 03:04:43,110
Your character won't scream.

2573
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:44,229
You'll just slowly die.

2574
03:04:44,229 --> 03:04:45,670
And it's one of the worst things.

2575
03:04:45,670 --> 03:04:45,989
OK.

2576
03:04:48,450 --> 03:04:50,770
So the deal is, what are we trying to mine?

2577
03:04:50,770 --> 03:04:51,170
These ones?

2578
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:53,479
I don't know.

2579
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:55,159
I just don't know.

2580
03:04:55,159 --> 03:04:55,719
What are we mining?

2581
03:04:55,719 --> 03:04:56,360
I don't know.

2582
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:58,680
No, but I mean, what's the goal?

2583
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:00,440
What are we trying to get, if you said?

2584
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:01,159
The Hellstone.

2585
03:05:01,159 --> 03:05:02,360
We're mining the Hellstone.

2586
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:04,600
And it'll hurt you if you stand on the Hellstone.

2587
03:05:05,719 --> 03:05:13,319
So that shit's Hellstone.

2588
03:05:13,319 --> 03:05:14,120
You drown in lava?

2589
03:05:14,120 --> 03:05:14,360
No.

2590
03:05:16,579 --> 03:05:18,180
You drown in lava.

2591
03:05:18,180 --> 03:05:20,079
Should I try to get some of that shit over there?

2592
03:05:20,719 --> 03:05:24,000
Is that going to burn me?

2593
03:05:25,409 --> 03:05:28,850
You can stand in lava for seven seconds with the obsidian potion.

2594
03:05:30,069 --> 03:05:32,950
Just make sure you don't actually stand on the Hellstone,

2595
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:34,149
because it will still hurt you.

2596
03:05:34,149 --> 03:05:34,469
OK.

2597
03:05:35,110 --> 03:05:47,600
OK.

2598
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:49,430
How much this do we need?

2599
03:05:49,430 --> 03:05:52,950
The poor guy occasionally blacks out during conversation.

2600
03:05:55,110 --> 03:05:56,280
We're worried about you.

2601
03:05:56,280 --> 03:05:57,079
You have any hobbies?

2602
03:05:57,079 --> 03:05:57,959
You get out there?

2603
03:05:57,959 --> 03:05:59,159
You get enough exercise?

2604
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:02,899
No, there's just a lot going on,

2605
03:06:02,899 --> 03:06:05,540
but my second time ever playing Terraria.

2606
03:06:08,680 --> 03:06:09,159
Come on.

2607
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:13,079
You have like 6,000 hours in this game.

2608
03:06:13,079 --> 03:06:14,920
This is the second time I've ever played it.

2609
03:06:15,079 --> 03:06:17,479
Nothing to do with how much Terraria you play.

2610
03:06:17,479 --> 03:06:18,040
Yes, it is.

2611
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:20,920
It's how much you listen to people when they talk to you.

2612
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:22,920
It's a lot of information to process.

2613
03:06:23,879 --> 03:06:34,920
He was busy reminiscing about the 50s.

2614
03:06:35,559 --> 03:06:38,500
At least someone's honest.

2615
03:06:39,139 --> 03:07:00,450
Can you delete lava?

2616
03:07:02,639 --> 03:07:04,239
Is this like a Minecraft way to block it?

2617
03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:06,559
No.

2618
03:07:07,520 --> 03:07:09,440
I mean, if you just like build around it.

2619
03:07:10,639 --> 03:07:14,290
Also, yeah, Hellstone creates lava when you mine it.

2620
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:16,469
It's a thing that's happening.

2621
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:18,959
All right.

2622
03:07:18,959 --> 03:07:20,719
I think if this function is going to run out here in a second,

2623
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:24,579
I have 55 seconds.

2624
03:07:28,600 --> 03:07:29,319
I have a minute.

2625
03:07:29,319 --> 03:07:30,600
Oh, what was I doing?

2626
03:07:31,559 --> 03:07:35,520
How much do I have?

2627
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:40,129
17, 40 seconds.

2628
03:07:47,079 --> 03:07:54,309
Also, we need a platform that goes from left to right.

2629
03:07:55,190 --> 03:07:56,549
Very far distance down here,

2630
03:07:56,549 --> 03:07:57,909
but we can fight the wall with flesh.

2631
03:07:57,909 --> 03:07:58,709
I have like 20.

2632
03:07:58,709 --> 03:08:00,709
I'm not like going to risk going down there anymore.

2633
03:08:02,309 --> 03:08:07,329
What's that?

2634
03:08:13,969 --> 03:08:14,530
Some in there.

2635
03:08:14,530 --> 03:08:15,569
I'm not opening that up.

2636
03:08:15,569 --> 03:08:17,329
I'll just drown.

2637
03:08:17,329 --> 03:08:20,530
Work on operation left and right platform.

2638
03:08:20,530 --> 03:08:21,639
Okay.

2639
03:08:21,639 --> 03:08:23,000
Like towards where you are now?

2640
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:27,120
Either direction works, honestly.

2641
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:28,719
I don't think I don't have any like wood with me.

2642
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:33,319
Can I not fly down here?

2643
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:35,399
Or do I have to be running to fly?

2644
03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:39,440
You should be able to fly.

2645
03:08:48,479 --> 03:08:49,440
Old face?

2646
03:08:49,440 --> 03:08:50,079
What the fuck?

2647
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:51,670
Yeah, I was holding it.

2648
03:08:51,670 --> 03:08:52,149
That was weird.

2649
03:08:53,909 --> 03:08:55,190
I have to hit it a third time.

2650
03:08:55,190 --> 03:08:55,510
Okay.

2651
03:08:59,030 --> 03:08:59,270
All right.

2652
03:09:01,670 --> 03:09:03,270
How safe is it over to you right now?

2653
03:09:03,270 --> 03:09:04,309
I can't really tell.

2654
03:09:04,309 --> 03:09:04,790
It's safe.

2655
03:09:05,670 --> 03:09:07,600
I've got platforms starting to go this way.

2656
03:09:08,399 --> 03:09:11,590
I'm afraid I need this lava and shit.

2657
03:09:18,149 --> 03:09:18,790
Oh, no.

2658
03:09:21,319 --> 03:09:22,200
Not the lava.

2659
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:23,860
Okay.

2660
03:09:24,420 --> 03:09:25,639
I am coming over there.

2661
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:29,000
I'm assuming you already got all these chests, right?

2662
03:09:30,639 --> 03:09:32,159
No, we can't open those.

2663
03:09:32,159 --> 03:09:35,409
We can't open these unless you have a shadow key.

2664
03:09:35,409 --> 03:09:39,010
I remembered getting a shadow key, but I like don't have a character.

2665
03:09:39,010 --> 03:09:40,209
We don't have one in our stash.

2666
03:09:41,170 --> 03:09:42,690
But you need a shadow key to open these.

2667
03:09:43,329 --> 03:09:44,690
I swear we got one, though.

2668
03:09:45,489 --> 03:09:48,450
I'm swearing it so hard.

2669
03:09:48,450 --> 03:09:49,729
I'm swearing it.

2670
03:09:50,370 --> 03:09:50,770
All right.

2671
03:09:52,850 --> 03:09:54,420
Obsidian door.

2672
03:09:55,459 --> 03:09:57,000
Oh, my God.

2673
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:57,559
What have I done?

2674
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:59,670
It's okay.

2675
03:10:00,469 --> 03:10:02,309
There was like lava.

2676
03:10:02,309 --> 03:10:04,149
There was lava like in the room.

2677
03:10:04,149 --> 03:10:05,829
Did you like pull a little lava in here?

2678
03:10:06,309 --> 03:10:09,190
The lava slimes.

2679
03:10:11,750 --> 03:10:13,030
You give me all the health you got?

2680
03:10:13,670 --> 03:10:14,229
Yes, I will.

2681
03:10:14,870 --> 03:10:15,350
Here you go.

2682
03:10:16,069 --> 03:10:24,209
I'm assuming we're going to fight something down here.

2683
03:10:24,209 --> 03:10:26,129
If I were betting on it.

2684
03:10:29,479 --> 03:10:29,639
Yeah.

2685
03:10:30,280 --> 03:10:33,860
So do not.

2686
03:10:33,860 --> 03:10:36,340
Last time I opened one of these chests, our game's froze.

2687
03:10:36,340 --> 03:10:36,979
So we cannot.

2688
03:10:36,979 --> 03:10:38,020
There's no way to open them.

2689
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:39,459
We need like special keys or something, right?

2690
03:10:40,180 --> 03:10:40,899
We need a key.

2691
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:45,360
Did you say you're going to give me a platform?

2692
03:10:45,360 --> 03:10:45,760
Yeah, come here.

2693
03:10:54,049 --> 03:10:56,930
We want it to be at one level, not like multiple levels.

2694
03:10:56,930 --> 03:10:58,610
So just like going in a straight line.

2695
03:10:58,610 --> 03:10:59,170
Okay.

2696
03:10:59,170 --> 03:11:00,290
Do you want me to go the other way?

2697
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:01,809
Do you want me to just keep going with you this way?

2698
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:04,399
Like, do you want me to like?

2699
03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:06,479
Let's just both go the same direction.

2700
03:11:06,479 --> 03:11:07,120
The same direction.

2701
03:11:09,959 --> 03:11:11,079
Did you get me to play?

2702
03:11:11,079 --> 03:11:11,959
You did, you did.

2703
03:11:11,959 --> 03:11:13,639
You would platform this.

2704
03:11:13,639 --> 03:11:26,920
Ay, ya, ya.

2705
03:11:26,920 --> 03:11:27,799
Ay, ya, ya.

2706
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:39,680
So, all right, you can just let it drop here.

2707
03:11:41,280 --> 03:11:41,920
Walk across.

2708
03:11:45,350 --> 03:11:49,430
There is a thing that will come at you and it will move towards you forever.

2709
03:11:49,510 --> 03:11:50,790
And you can't go behind it.

2710
03:11:51,510 --> 03:11:54,069
So you need a lot of like backing up space.

2711
03:11:54,629 --> 03:11:56,100
Okay.

2712
03:11:56,100 --> 03:11:58,500
There's like a flame wall or something that comes over here.

2713
03:11:59,879 --> 03:12:00,920
A flesh wall.

2714
03:12:01,879 --> 03:12:03,079
It's the wall of flesh.

2715
03:12:03,079 --> 03:12:05,319
It's the actual wall of flesh.

2716
03:12:06,120 --> 03:12:07,399
Yeah, it's not just nicknames.

2717
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:10,360
That's its real name.

2718
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:11,159
That's what it is.

2719
03:12:11,159 --> 03:12:13,639
That's not like what they call me when I go to the gym or anything.

2720
03:12:21,829 --> 03:12:23,430
I'm going to make sure I have my summons.

2721
03:12:23,430 --> 03:12:27,399
Guys, I'm frickin' ready.

2722
03:12:27,399 --> 03:12:28,440
Can you like do something?

2723
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:30,920
I thought, well, I was waiting to see what...

2724
03:12:31,639 --> 03:12:33,110
I don't know, I've never done this before.

2725
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:34,309
I don't know how far we need to go.

2726
03:12:35,190 --> 03:12:36,069
Very far.

2727
03:12:36,069 --> 03:12:36,790
Very far.

2728
03:12:37,510 --> 03:12:38,549
Very far.

2729
03:12:38,549 --> 03:12:47,280
I thought we were working together, you know?

2730
03:12:47,920 --> 03:13:12,049
Hey, I didn't do that.

2731
03:13:13,250 --> 03:13:14,290
That was you who did.

2732
03:13:15,010 --> 03:13:24,440
Okay, so just keep going.

2733
03:13:25,319 --> 03:13:27,059
Let's just keep on.

2734
03:13:27,059 --> 03:13:28,579
We should actually go the other direction.

2735
03:13:28,579 --> 03:13:29,780
Because this is where we come down.

2736
03:13:30,500 --> 03:13:40,930
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

2737
03:13:41,010 --> 03:13:41,969
That's way easier.

2738
03:13:44,159 --> 03:13:44,659
Yep.

2739
03:13:46,340 --> 03:13:48,579
Somebody gave $50 to you.

2740
03:13:48,579 --> 03:13:50,100
They said, hey, stirrer, thanks for the stream.

2741
03:13:50,100 --> 03:13:50,819
It's been hilarious.

2742
03:13:50,819 --> 03:13:52,420
This German guy's kind of a psycho.

2743
03:13:52,420 --> 03:13:52,920
LOL.

2744
03:13:53,700 --> 03:13:56,659
That was from Shining Path.

2745
03:13:57,840 --> 03:13:58,340
Nice.

2746
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:02,579
Yeah, I mean, thank you, Shining Path.

2747
03:14:02,579 --> 03:14:04,260
For the $50, by the way.

2748
03:14:10,399 --> 03:14:12,389
That's a lot of fucking money.

2749
03:14:12,389 --> 03:14:12,889
Thank you.

2750
03:14:13,270 --> 03:14:14,559
To star.

2751
03:14:14,559 --> 03:14:15,360
Thank you.

2752
03:14:15,360 --> 03:14:16,399
Thank you to star.

2753
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:17,120
Yeah, no problem.

2754
03:14:17,120 --> 03:14:18,799
I mean, like, I'm the highlight of the stream.

2755
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:25,440
You know, I'm like, I'm like woke.

2756
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:31,399
Oh, come on.

2757
03:14:31,399 --> 03:14:32,520
Really? You knocked it over.

2758
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:36,069
Oh, my God.

2759
03:14:38,069 --> 03:14:39,909
Is this truly the legendary blade?

2760
03:14:42,959 --> 03:14:45,520
Like, I have such shit weapons this whole game.

2761
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:46,959
I'm going to probably going to need something better.

2762
03:14:52,370 --> 03:14:53,729
This thing ain't good.

2763
03:14:53,729 --> 03:15:01,620
No, it's not.

2764
03:15:01,620 --> 03:15:03,379
Did they kill the wall of flesh yet?

2765
03:15:03,379 --> 03:15:03,879
That's a...

2766
03:15:04,870 --> 03:15:05,670
That's a question.

2767
03:15:05,670 --> 03:15:06,469
I'm almost out of...

2768
03:15:06,469 --> 03:15:09,670
I'm out of, um, platform.

2769
03:15:09,670 --> 03:15:10,549
I got no more.

2770
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:12,680
Here.

2771
03:15:13,459 --> 03:15:13,959
Take.

2772
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:15,649
Thanks.

2773
03:15:15,649 --> 03:15:16,209
Keep going.

2774
03:15:16,209 --> 03:15:16,930
I'll defend you.

2775
03:15:17,489 --> 03:15:18,530
I'll put that to good use.

2776
03:15:19,170 --> 03:15:33,840
I should make a funny trap so when he comes over here one time,

2777
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:35,280
he'll fall in when we fight the boss.

2778
03:15:35,280 --> 03:15:41,829
So, um, this is activating hard mode, essentially, after this.

2779
03:15:42,629 --> 03:15:46,399
It's like the final thing you do before it becomes hard mode.

2780
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:49,809
You don't even know what that means.

2781
03:15:50,370 --> 03:15:51,090
I don't.

2782
03:15:51,090 --> 03:15:53,010
I mean, I know it just means the game is hard or no.

2783
03:15:55,909 --> 03:15:56,469
Don't do it.

2784
03:15:56,469 --> 03:15:57,190
Don't do it.

2785
03:15:57,190 --> 03:15:57,670
Don't do it.

2786
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:58,229
What are you talking about?

2787
03:16:01,729 --> 03:16:02,290
What is going on?

2788
03:16:03,010 --> 03:16:12,610
Uh, don't touch...

2789
03:16:12,610 --> 03:16:14,129
That ground will hurt you.

2790
03:16:14,129 --> 03:16:15,649
So just be sure you don't stand on it.

2791
03:16:15,649 --> 03:16:16,149
Yeah.

2792
03:16:20,239 --> 03:16:22,000
Uh, you keep doing what you're doing.

2793
03:16:23,170 --> 03:16:23,809
I'll be back.

2794
03:16:24,450 --> 03:16:27,010
I'm gonna try and make this bow before we fight it

2795
03:16:27,010 --> 03:16:29,409
because my weapons have been garbage this whole game.

2796
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,040
And, you know, I'm just kind of sick of it.

2797
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:37,520
I feel like I deserve happiness as much as anyone else.

2798
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:39,920
How come I keep putting myself before other people?

2799
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:41,040
Is this lava ever gonna go away?

2800
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:45,079
I'm trying to, like, drop it.

2801
03:16:45,879 --> 03:16:49,090
Hey, look at that.

2802
03:17:06,639 --> 03:17:08,239
This feels so odd doing this.

2803
03:17:09,360 --> 03:17:10,559
I'm out of platforms again.

2804
03:17:11,459 --> 03:17:12,819
Oh, well...

2805
03:17:12,819 --> 03:17:13,940
I've gone all the way over here.

2806
03:17:15,700 --> 03:17:18,819
It's also better if you do it with, uh, just, like, bricks.

2807
03:17:18,819 --> 03:17:21,379
So if you have any random bricks, like dirt or something.

2808
03:17:21,379 --> 03:17:22,260
I mean, I have, like...

2809
03:17:22,979 --> 03:17:24,260
I have obsidian brick.

2810
03:17:25,219 --> 03:17:25,940
Yeah.

2811
03:17:25,940 --> 03:17:26,579
Just go for it.

2812
03:17:26,579 --> 03:17:27,379
Go wild.

2813
03:17:27,379 --> 03:17:28,579
Just do it with a brick?

2814
03:17:29,540 --> 03:17:32,790
Will it be, like, on the same plane?

2815
03:17:34,229 --> 03:17:34,870
I guess so.

2816
03:17:35,750 --> 03:17:39,090
I didn't know if it, like, caught the top of the, um...

2817
03:17:39,090 --> 03:17:42,739
The lip of the wood, like, the platforms.

2818
03:17:43,379 --> 03:17:43,860
What?

2819
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:46,610
Can I just make obsidian platforms right now?

2820
03:17:46,610 --> 03:17:47,409
Oh, fuck.

2821
03:17:47,409 --> 03:17:48,049
Yeah, you can.

2822
03:17:48,049 --> 03:17:48,610
Just go.

2823
03:17:48,610 --> 03:17:49,809
Oh, just go, just go.

2824
03:17:50,850 --> 03:17:57,780
Just go!

2825
03:17:57,780 --> 03:17:59,299
I'm do- I'm going.

2826
03:17:59,780 --> 03:18:05,250
What are you waiting around for?

2827
03:18:05,889 --> 03:18:06,610
I'm not.

2828
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:09,430
I just touched.

2829
03:18:09,430 --> 03:18:09,989
Ow.

2830
03:18:09,989 --> 03:18:13,190
Somebody just threw, like, a fucking boomerang at me.

2831
03:18:14,149 --> 03:18:15,190
Kill this guy!

2832
03:18:15,190 --> 03:18:15,750
Not you.

2833
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:16,950
My- my minions!

2834
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:18,149
They're just hanging out in here.

2835
03:18:18,709 --> 03:18:19,750
What are you guys doing?

2836
03:18:20,069 --> 03:18:22,450
What are you guys doing?

2837
03:18:25,170 --> 03:18:26,450
They've- they've trapped themselves.

2838
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:27,729
All right, I need to...

2839
03:18:28,610 --> 03:18:33,569
Oh, you idiots.

2840
03:18:39,559 --> 03:18:40,920
I'm on new minions now.

2841
03:18:41,559 --> 03:18:42,659
You guys blew it.

2842
03:18:44,659 --> 03:18:45,860
Uh, once we go into hard mode,

2843
03:18:45,860 --> 03:18:48,579
we can actually get you, like, an absurdly overpowered...

2844
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:50,340
Minion.

2845
03:18:50,340 --> 03:18:50,840
Really?

2846
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:52,180
Yeah.

2847
03:18:52,180 --> 03:18:56,020
It- it will, like, autopilot the rest of the game for you

2848
03:18:56,020 --> 03:18:57,219
for, like, a long time.

2849
03:18:57,219 --> 03:18:59,059
If you- you're into that sort of thing.

2850
03:18:59,059 --> 03:19:02,360
It tracks minions through walls,

2851
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:04,280
like, very slightly off your screen.

2852
03:19:04,280 --> 03:19:05,399
It just kills everything.

2853
03:19:06,040 --> 03:19:06,920
Really?

2854
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:08,120
It's nuts, yeah.

2855
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:10,360
I feel like that's- would that be fun, though?

2856
03:19:12,069 --> 03:19:13,030
I used to use it.

2857
03:19:13,030 --> 03:19:13,670
It was kind of fun.

2858
03:19:14,469 --> 03:19:16,229
I mean, it's, like, fun to not be annoyed.

2859
03:19:17,030 --> 03:19:21,379
Oh, there's a new one.

2860
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:22,659
What is it?

2861
03:19:22,659 --> 03:19:29,250
Um, what's the matter?

2862
03:19:29,250 --> 03:19:29,649
Nothing.

2863
03:19:29,649 --> 03:19:30,450
Nothing's the matter.

2864
03:19:31,329 --> 03:19:34,399
You're doing great, honey.

2865
03:19:34,399 --> 03:19:35,040
Thanks.

2866
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:36,639
I need to fight a boss.

2867
03:19:36,639 --> 03:19:37,600
What's the matter, actually?

2868
03:19:38,319 --> 03:19:39,280
Any more demonite?

2869
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:44,819
I'm almost out of, I think, ways to make platforms.

2870
03:19:48,340 --> 03:19:48,819
Frog.

2871
03:19:49,459 --> 03:19:50,020
Uh, star.

2872
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:52,899
I'm- I'm almost out of, uh, platforms.

2873
03:20:10,020 --> 03:20:11,489
I'm fucking busy.

2874
03:20:12,049 --> 03:20:23,409
Okay.

2875
03:20:24,129 --> 03:20:25,250
That's what I got.

2876
03:20:25,250 --> 03:20:27,969
I do have- I have, uh, ash blocks?

2877
03:20:27,969 --> 03:20:28,610
Can I make, like...

2878
03:20:29,729 --> 03:20:30,850
Yeah, that works.

2879
03:20:30,850 --> 03:20:31,489
That works, too?

2880
03:20:31,489 --> 03:20:32,129
They're not gonna fall?

2881
03:20:33,010 --> 03:20:33,510
Mm-mm.

2882
03:20:34,209 --> 03:20:37,600
It's, like, silt and sand, that fall.

2883
03:20:46,149 --> 03:20:47,030
Oh, my God.

2884
03:20:47,030 --> 03:20:48,870
These guys are throwing the fucking boomerangs.

2885
03:20:50,209 --> 03:20:51,250
Where are my friends?

2886
03:20:51,889 --> 03:20:57,639
I thought I could trust you guys.

2887
03:21:02,770 --> 03:21:03,809
Why didn't they come here?

2888
03:21:03,809 --> 03:21:07,079
Oh, fucking idiot.

2889
03:21:13,280 --> 03:21:15,040
Oh, you guys are dunking into the water.

2890
03:21:15,760 --> 03:21:17,190
The very hot water.

2891
03:21:17,909 --> 03:21:19,110
To kill the worm.

2892
03:21:19,110 --> 03:21:19,750
I get it now.

2893
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:22,479
Eater of worlds has awoken.

2894
03:21:24,629 --> 03:21:25,129
Star?

2895
03:21:25,829 --> 03:21:26,329
Yeah?

2896
03:21:27,729 --> 03:21:28,450
Uh, boss.

2897
03:21:28,450 --> 03:21:29,489
We already fought this boss.

2898
03:21:29,489 --> 03:21:31,170
I just need more resource.

2899
03:21:33,110 --> 03:21:34,389
From which side?

2900
03:21:36,069 --> 03:21:37,590
Just comes up and swallows me.

2901
03:21:38,149 --> 03:21:39,590
Like the big fish in Mario.

2902
03:21:45,399 --> 03:21:46,440
Is there- why is it-

2903
03:21:46,440 --> 03:21:47,959
Is there a reason why this says 8 a.m.?

2904
03:21:53,489 --> 03:21:54,370
8 a.m., no.

2905
03:21:55,170 --> 03:21:57,489
I am officially out of materials.

2906
03:21:59,010 --> 03:22:00,370
Besides, like, uh, yeah.

2907
03:22:00,370 --> 03:22:02,209
I have no more, like, materials to keep this going.

2908
03:22:04,149 --> 03:22:04,649
Okay.

2909
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:06,229
Back to town.

2910
03:22:07,319 --> 03:22:08,120
It might be enough.

2911
03:22:08,120 --> 03:22:09,719
I think we're pretty- I'm pretty buff.

2912
03:22:12,129 --> 03:22:15,729
Normally you can kill wall of flesh if you just walk backwards and throw dynamite on the ground.

2913
03:22:17,030 --> 03:22:21,350
Which, dynamite falls through platforms, so we can't really do that in all the spots.

2914
03:22:21,350 --> 03:22:23,510
I'm just testing my work to make sure we can go right through it.

2915
03:22:24,629 --> 03:22:27,110
We just need to walk- run backwards, right?

2916
03:22:28,149 --> 03:22:28,649
Yeah.

2917
03:22:29,700 --> 03:22:32,500
Because I'm just making sure that there's plenty of space, there's no holes.

2918
03:22:33,700 --> 03:22:34,819
You know, I'm just checking my work.

2919
03:22:38,870 --> 03:22:39,590
It's pretty good.

2920
03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:44,239
She seems like there's- wait, there's a hole right there!

2921
03:22:44,319 --> 03:22:44,959
Aha!

2922
03:22:44,959 --> 03:22:46,319
This is why you check your work!

2923
03:22:47,360 --> 03:22:50,799
The, um, sometimes the lava slimes will create lava when you kill them,

2924
03:22:50,799 --> 03:22:52,799
and they'll, like, rip a hole in the platform.

2925
03:22:52,799 --> 03:22:53,760
This is why you check your work.

2926
03:22:56,229 --> 03:22:57,030
Okay.

2927
03:22:57,030 --> 03:23:00,680
I think, uh, I'm- so I'm just gonna come back to you.

2928
03:23:03,170 --> 03:23:05,010
That sounds- that sounds great.

2929
03:23:06,530 --> 03:23:09,059
Hello.

2930
03:23:10,079 --> 03:23:10,639
What do we got?

2931
03:23:10,639 --> 03:23:11,139
Hey.

2932
03:23:11,440 --> 03:23:16,319
I need those potions.

2933
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:20,930
A lot of apples.

2934
03:23:20,930 --> 03:23:22,530
Fuck, I sold that.

2935
03:23:22,530 --> 03:23:23,569
Oh, come on.

2936
03:23:24,450 --> 03:23:28,790
Is it raining presents?

2937
03:23:29,510 --> 03:23:31,760
Okay, I don't need it.

2938
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:33,760
It's raining presents from the sky.

2939
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:37,760
Yeah, it's raining, um, slimes that are dying and turning into presents.

2940
03:23:38,399 --> 03:23:38,799
What?

2941
03:23:38,799 --> 03:23:39,440
That's awesome!

2942
03:23:41,639 --> 03:23:44,280
Sometimes during this, uh, slime king appearance.

2943
03:23:44,280 --> 03:23:45,799
Oh, does he?

2944
03:23:45,799 --> 03:23:46,299
That's cool.

2945
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:51,059
Uh, can I have that bee bow?

2946
03:23:51,860 --> 03:23:53,159
Yes.

2947
03:23:53,159 --> 03:23:54,440
Yes, you can have the bee bow.

2948
03:23:55,559 --> 03:23:58,739
Don't you just love beemo?

2949
03:24:00,020 --> 03:24:01,700
I- I don't know.

2950
03:24:01,700 --> 03:24:02,200
What is that?

2951
03:24:03,399 --> 03:24:04,520
Uh, bee bow.

2952
03:24:06,389 --> 03:24:08,229
You need the bee arrows.

2953
03:24:09,030 --> 03:24:09,590
No.

2954
03:24:09,590 --> 03:24:10,090
Okay.

2955
03:24:19,670 --> 03:24:21,110
Even more people have shown up.

2956
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:24,129
God damn it.

2957
03:24:25,799 --> 03:24:28,200
Oh, what a pain in the ass this is becoming.

2958
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:30,440
I got- okay, go back to the corruption.

2959
03:24:31,079 --> 03:24:32,100
Christmas hats?

2960
03:24:47,440 --> 03:24:49,829
All right, um, potions.

2961
03:24:49,829 --> 03:24:59,200
I want to bring out my life regen speed ones.

2962
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:03,729
You already have the materials.

2963
03:25:04,610 --> 03:25:05,110
Yeah?

2964
03:25:05,969 --> 03:25:11,510
Get some of that bacon out here.

2965
03:25:12,469 --> 03:25:30,639
I think I'm good, right?

2966
03:25:30,639 --> 03:25:37,680
I got life regen, summoning ability, defense, movement speed, oh, and mana regen.

2967
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:49,280
Um, fuck, dude.

2968
03:25:49,280 --> 03:25:51,760
If you could figure out how to make a kiln, that would really help.

2969
03:25:52,399 --> 03:25:53,379
What?

2970
03:25:53,379 --> 03:25:56,500
What's with this, like, social network website spam?

2971
03:25:57,920 --> 03:25:58,420
What?

2972
03:25:58,420 --> 03:26:00,479
Say that again, sorry, people are going insane.

2973
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:06,479
I said if you found out how to make a kiln, that would really help.

2974
03:26:06,479 --> 03:26:06,979
A kiln?

2975
03:26:07,940 --> 03:26:10,579
Yeah, it's like, I think it uses lead and I don't know what else.

2976
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:13,639
Kiln?

2977
03:26:13,639 --> 03:26:14,440
Anybody understand?

2978
03:26:15,079 --> 03:26:16,200
Looking for how to make a kiln.

2979
03:26:21,340 --> 03:26:25,180
Um, it is 18 iron bars and eight torches.

2980
03:26:26,059 --> 03:26:27,260
I don't know if we have enough iron.

2981
03:26:28,780 --> 03:26:29,280
Let's see.

2982
03:26:29,819 --> 03:26:32,379
I have seven, it's lead for us.

2983
03:26:32,379 --> 03:26:33,180
Oh, lead.

2984
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:35,500
Uh, there's no lead in the box.

2985
03:26:36,379 --> 03:26:37,100
God damn it.

2986
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:38,219
King Slime?

2987
03:26:38,219 --> 03:26:38,700
Is he?

2988
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:39,420
Oh, King Slime.

2989
03:26:39,979 --> 03:26:40,479
Yeah.

2990
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:44,379
He's in, oh no, he's inside.

2991
03:26:44,379 --> 03:26:45,979
He's inside, he's killing, people are dead.

2992
03:26:45,979 --> 03:26:47,500
He's killing people, people are gonna die.

2993
03:26:51,239 --> 03:26:54,040
All right, well, like, what kind of panicking asshole am I?

2994
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:57,079
I'm just standing outside watching him kill everybody.

2995
03:26:57,079 --> 03:26:59,719
Uh, he's killing people, he's, he's, he's killing people inside.

2996
03:27:01,719 --> 03:27:02,920
I'm witnessing a murder.

2997
03:27:02,920 --> 03:27:04,360
I mean, he's murdering people.

2998
03:27:05,959 --> 03:27:08,159
I feel like I've got something I should do.

2999
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:10,889
All right, he's dead.

3000
03:27:10,889 --> 03:27:14,090
Oh, you should be able to get that rideable slime that I had that you were jealous of,

3001
03:27:14,090 --> 03:27:16,170
but you're not jealous of anymore because you have a frog.

3002
03:27:17,479 --> 03:27:22,030
Yeah, let's see what I got.

3003
03:27:24,940 --> 03:27:25,899
I'm on the phone with you.

3004
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:32,440
Slime just teleported inside and I'm out here right now, man, and it is wild.

3005
03:27:33,309 --> 03:27:34,750
They look just like people.

3006
03:27:35,629 --> 03:27:40,889
So what happens if he, okay, what happens if somebody in here dies?

3007
03:27:42,510 --> 03:27:45,629
Then they're dead and they respawn after like a day or two.

3008
03:27:46,680 --> 03:27:49,559
You get like a new guy with a new name that does the same job.

3009
03:27:49,559 --> 03:27:53,500
Oh, solidifier.

3010
03:27:54,719 --> 03:27:56,399
You know, you're all replaceable.

3011
03:27:57,239 --> 03:27:58,520
You think slime hook.

3012
03:27:58,520 --> 03:27:59,479
We need you.

3013
03:27:59,479 --> 03:28:02,920
You know how many people want this passion job you're done for.

3014
03:28:03,879 --> 03:28:05,319
I got a slime hook now.

3015
03:28:05,319 --> 03:28:09,479
Oh, I think that one is like a triple gooper.

3016
03:28:11,290 --> 03:28:11,690
Is it?

3017
03:28:12,329 --> 03:28:15,049
Yeah, like it attaches multiple times.

3018
03:28:15,049 --> 03:28:17,020
I think so.

3019
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:28,329
It doesn't look like it's doing anything different.

3020
03:28:31,500 --> 03:28:33,180
While you're attached, trying to shoot it again.

3021
03:28:35,100 --> 03:28:37,260
Whoa, whoa, Spider-Man.

3022
03:28:43,159 --> 03:28:45,159
Oh, our merchant fucking died, didn't he?

3023
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:47,559
I need like for the first time ever, I needed him.

3024
03:28:49,079 --> 03:28:50,280
Oh, no, nobody died.

3025
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:50,760
Who died?

3026
03:28:51,399 --> 03:28:53,530
Who died?

3027
03:28:56,319 --> 03:28:57,760
The merchant used to be right there.

3028
03:28:57,760 --> 03:28:58,639
What do you mean the merchant?

3029
03:28:59,440 --> 03:29:01,340
They got a guy with a beard.

3030
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:02,620
Oh, he's over here now.

3031
03:29:02,620 --> 03:29:03,260
Ralph.

3032
03:29:03,260 --> 03:29:04,540
He died a while ago.

3033
03:29:04,540 --> 03:29:06,680
All right.

3034
03:29:06,680 --> 03:29:07,879
These guys are fucking annoying.

3035
03:29:07,879 --> 03:29:08,360
Not even him.

3036
03:29:09,079 --> 03:29:10,520
Who sells like good arrows?

3037
03:29:12,719 --> 03:29:13,600
Odd Michael over here.

3038
03:29:16,489 --> 03:29:17,290
Is that for real?

3039
03:29:18,569 --> 03:29:19,209
Odd Michael.

3040
03:29:20,360 --> 03:29:21,159
Odd Michael.

3041
03:29:25,610 --> 03:29:25,930
All right.

3042
03:29:25,930 --> 03:29:28,489
I got technique hidden blade.

3043
03:29:32,510 --> 03:29:33,229
Throwing class.

3044
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:35,709
I'm irrelevant to you.

3045
03:29:35,709 --> 03:29:36,909
Okay, ninja hood.

3046
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:39,360
Relevant, right?

3047
03:29:40,239 --> 03:29:40,479
Yeah.

3048
03:29:41,440 --> 03:29:42,879
A bottle of water.

3049
03:29:42,879 --> 03:29:43,680
Whatever this is.

3050
03:29:43,680 --> 03:29:44,879
Blue slime banner.

3051
03:29:47,239 --> 03:29:48,520
Shinobi slicer.

3052
03:29:49,319 --> 03:29:52,319
Just putting it in.

3053
03:29:54,110 --> 03:29:54,670
Ruby hook.

3054
03:29:55,389 --> 03:29:58,959
Going in.

3055
03:29:58,959 --> 03:29:59,600
Mining potion.

3056
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:00,639
I don't want that.

3057
03:30:00,639 --> 03:30:03,559
Do you think I am auto-trashing?

3058
03:30:04,280 --> 03:30:09,229
No, it's just Jester.

3059
03:30:09,950 --> 03:30:13,549
Like shouldn't someone be selling Jester out?

3060
03:30:13,549 --> 03:30:14,110
Jester.

3061
03:30:14,110 --> 03:30:15,950
I feel like that's really familiar.

3062
03:30:16,909 --> 03:30:20,430
Or hellfire or something like just something better than wood.

3063
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:28,600
Or do I craft with wood arrows?

3064
03:30:28,600 --> 03:30:33,950
All right.

3065
03:30:33,950 --> 03:30:35,389
Let me see what I can do here.

3066
03:30:35,389 --> 03:30:36,590
I got six presents.

3067
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:47,920
Is anything actually good come out of these presents or never?

3068
03:30:47,920 --> 03:30:50,159
Is it just like a thing for fun for Christmas time?

3069
03:30:51,920 --> 03:30:55,520
I think it actually has seasonal events and something like there's Halloween items.

3070
03:30:58,409 --> 03:30:59,930
But no, they're not really good.

3071
03:30:59,930 --> 03:31:05,129
I know if during Halloween there's like costumes I can give you.

3072
03:31:05,129 --> 03:31:08,329
Yeah, I mean I got like the Santa Claus outfit.

3073
03:31:13,239 --> 03:31:13,559
All right.

3074
03:31:13,559 --> 03:31:15,079
Are we going to attempt the wall?

3075
03:31:17,149 --> 03:31:18,989
Let me make some arrows.

3076
03:31:18,989 --> 03:31:29,340
We're going for a wall attempt.

3077
03:31:30,459 --> 03:31:30,940
Possibly.

3078
03:31:34,120 --> 03:31:34,920
No, my computer.

3079
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:46,000
That was almost an F.

3080
03:31:47,280 --> 03:31:47,760
It was.

3081
03:31:48,479 --> 03:31:48,959
Almost.

3082
03:31:49,920 --> 03:32:00,200
Oh, money.

3083
03:32:00,200 --> 03:32:01,559
This is just lava down here.

3084
03:32:01,559 --> 03:32:03,000
Did a lava slime die down here?

3085
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:03,719
Is that what this is?

3086
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:13,690
What are you up to?

3087
03:32:15,309 --> 03:32:16,190
Buying arrows.

3088
03:32:16,829 --> 03:32:20,989
No, it's honey.

3089
03:32:20,989 --> 03:32:21,469
Stand in it.

3090
03:32:38,649 --> 03:32:40,889
So what's the basic rundown?

3091
03:32:40,889 --> 03:32:42,569
Blood moon is rising.

3092
03:32:42,569 --> 03:32:44,170
Well, now we're stuck here.

3093
03:32:44,170 --> 03:32:44,969
Just ignore it.

3094
03:32:44,969 --> 03:32:46,090
You don't have to stay here.

3095
03:32:56,350 --> 03:32:57,790
Oh, fuck, dude.

3096
03:32:59,500 --> 03:33:02,620
Dude, the streamer looks really cute.

3097
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:03,659
Hey.

3098
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:05,629
Hey, cool.

3099
03:33:05,629 --> 03:33:06,030
Thank you.

3100
03:33:07,739 --> 03:33:09,840
Oh, he thought it was for him.

3101
03:33:11,370 --> 03:33:12,329
Well, it should be.

3102
03:33:12,329 --> 03:33:13,930
It's in my chat room.

3103
03:33:15,290 --> 03:33:19,530
I thought it was that each chat is for the other person.

3104
03:33:19,530 --> 03:33:22,090
That's why, like, you get the $50 for me.

3105
03:33:22,090 --> 03:33:22,649
Oh, right.

3106
03:33:25,159 --> 03:33:26,760
We both don't have face cams.

3107
03:33:26,760 --> 03:33:26,920
No.

3108
03:33:31,020 --> 03:33:31,979
No, we do not.

3109
03:33:31,979 --> 03:33:43,049
A lot of stuff out here.

3110
03:33:43,049 --> 03:33:48,010
I can't just leave without picking up this stuff.

3111
03:33:49,819 --> 03:33:50,780
Even if it's worthless.

3112
03:33:54,139 --> 03:33:54,540
Nice.

3113
03:33:55,100 --> 03:33:56,299
I need more hellstone.

3114
03:33:56,299 --> 03:33:57,100
God damn it.

3115
03:33:57,100 --> 03:33:57,579
Wait, no.

3116
03:33:58,459 --> 03:33:59,420
I shouldn't.

3117
03:33:59,420 --> 03:34:00,299
I need obsidian.

3118
03:34:00,299 --> 03:34:03,020
That's what I need to make hellstone.

3119
03:34:03,979 --> 03:34:04,700
I want to do that.

3120
03:34:05,260 --> 03:34:16,920
How much do I have to pay?

3121
03:34:16,920 --> 03:34:17,159
No.

3122
03:34:18,280 --> 03:34:19,000
Are we winning?

3123
03:34:20,510 --> 03:34:20,989
Get in there.

3124
03:34:25,129 --> 03:34:26,809
We've paid 700 times already.

3125
03:34:26,809 --> 03:34:27,610
You just missed it.

3126
03:34:28,409 --> 03:34:35,899
Free stuff on the roof.

3127
03:34:35,899 --> 03:34:36,860
Free stuff on the roof.

3128
03:34:37,579 --> 03:34:47,100
He's in there crafting.

3129
03:34:48,909 --> 03:34:49,790
Crafting.

3130
03:34:52,399 --> 03:34:54,479
He's down there crafting.

3131
03:34:55,360 --> 03:34:56,079
All right.

3132
03:34:56,079 --> 03:34:57,120
Are we doing this now?

3133
03:34:57,840 --> 03:34:59,120
Are we actually doing this?

3134
03:34:59,120 --> 03:35:01,440
I need like two seconds to grab obsidian.

3135
03:35:01,440 --> 03:35:03,440
Can you give me like two seconds?

3136
03:35:04,399 --> 03:35:08,729
Or you can help me get obsidian.

3137
03:35:08,729 --> 03:35:10,010
Like contribute.

3138
03:35:10,809 --> 03:35:13,819
I don't know, dude.

3139
03:35:14,540 --> 03:35:17,079
I don't know, man.

3140
03:35:17,799 --> 03:35:20,379
I'm currently fighting blood.

3141
03:35:23,979 --> 03:35:26,860
It's not like I'm having fun getting obsidian down here.

3142
03:35:26,860 --> 03:35:27,579
That's kind of cool.

3143
03:35:27,579 --> 03:35:28,379
That's kind of good.

3144
03:35:28,379 --> 03:35:28,860
Wait a minute.

3145
03:35:29,659 --> 03:35:32,780
So that's five defense.

3146
03:35:34,409 --> 03:35:34,889
Wait a minute.

3147
03:35:45,469 --> 03:35:46,479
All right.

3148
03:35:46,479 --> 03:35:47,440
I'm just going to come down to you.

3149
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:49,280
Okay.

3150
03:35:49,280 --> 03:35:50,479
I guess we can fight this.

3151
03:35:50,479 --> 03:35:51,280
Are we going to try this?

3152
03:35:51,280 --> 03:35:51,840
Be able to do it.

3153
03:35:53,959 --> 03:35:55,799
Go into the stash before you come down

3154
03:35:55,799 --> 03:35:59,079
because I don't have a return way yet.

3155
03:36:00,680 --> 03:36:02,200
Because I don't have a glass kiln.

3156
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:06,600
So you would like me to remove what from the stash?

3157
03:36:07,639 --> 03:36:08,360
Voodoo doll.

3158
03:36:11,319 --> 03:36:14,440
We have a guide voodoo doll and a clothier voodoo doll.

3159
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:15,719
Guide is what we need.

3160
03:36:15,719 --> 03:36:16,440
Just want one.

3161
03:36:19,079 --> 03:36:19,559
Just one.

3162
03:36:20,600 --> 03:36:21,159
Okay.

3163
03:36:21,159 --> 03:36:21,719
Anything else?

3164
03:36:23,239 --> 03:36:24,920
That is it.

3165
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:26,120
Oh, obsidian potions.

3166
03:36:26,120 --> 03:36:27,559
And obsidian potions.

3167
03:36:28,520 --> 03:36:32,620
I'll make sure not to drink two of them.

3168
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:34,299
I'm just going to buy them.

3169
03:36:34,299 --> 03:36:34,860
Do I have money?

3170
03:36:36,780 --> 03:36:39,159
I know I keep putting money in here.

3171
03:36:39,159 --> 03:36:42,969
So what do you think?

3172
03:36:42,969 --> 03:36:43,850
Four obsidian potions?

3173
03:36:45,870 --> 03:36:46,350
Just two.

3174
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:50,319
We either die or we don't right now.

3175
03:36:50,319 --> 03:36:50,639
Okay.

3176
03:36:50,639 --> 03:36:51,760
Either die or we don't.

3177
03:36:51,760 --> 03:36:52,159
You got it.

3178
03:36:58,459 --> 03:37:00,379
Make sure you touch the summoning thing.

3179
03:37:00,379 --> 03:37:00,940
Yeah, I am.

3180
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:04,959
And have a weapon that can attack at range.

3181
03:37:05,840 --> 03:37:07,229
That's kind of all I have.

3182
03:37:08,729 --> 03:37:11,930
Can you actually grab me the summon that skull

3183
03:37:11,930 --> 03:37:13,530
that you were using before that you didn't like?

3184
03:37:15,280 --> 03:37:16,719
The minotaur skull?

3185
03:37:17,600 --> 03:37:19,680
I can't- the weapon that shot the laser.

3186
03:37:21,079 --> 03:37:22,840
Weapon that shot the- oh no, I'm using that.

3187
03:37:23,799 --> 03:37:24,360
Oh, you are?

3188
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:25,079
Yeah, I am using that.

3189
03:37:25,079 --> 03:37:26,360
I thought you said you didn't like it.

3190
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:28,520
I don't like it, but it's doing more damage than what I have, so.

3191
03:37:29,319 --> 03:37:29,819
Okay.

3192
03:37:30,520 --> 03:37:31,879
Well, then yeah, you can come down here.

3193
03:37:33,500 --> 03:37:34,000
Okay.

3194
03:37:37,719 --> 03:37:38,440
I'm coming.

3195
03:37:49,559 --> 03:37:51,319
Oh, it's a- why did I save her?

3196
03:37:53,559 --> 03:37:54,059
Shit.

3197
03:37:55,799 --> 03:37:57,479
I didn't know who it was and I clicked on her

3198
03:37:57,479 --> 03:37:58,280
and then I should have known.

3199
03:38:02,280 --> 03:38:03,879
So is there a certain thing we do to summon this thing?

3200
03:38:05,899 --> 03:38:06,399
Yes.

3201
03:38:06,940 --> 03:38:07,260
Cool.

3202
03:38:07,260 --> 03:38:08,780
Let me break it down like this.

3203
03:38:08,780 --> 03:38:09,340
Break it down.

3204
03:38:11,579 --> 03:38:13,180
Which button do I have to press?

3205
03:38:16,510 --> 03:38:18,190
Nine, one, one.

3206
03:38:18,989 --> 03:38:20,780
Let me show off what I'm like.

3207
03:38:21,579 --> 03:38:22,620
You are down here.

3208
03:38:23,500 --> 03:38:25,659
Come all the way to the right.

3209
03:38:25,659 --> 03:38:26,159
Yes.

3210
03:38:26,879 --> 03:38:45,280
Coming.

3211
03:38:47,739 --> 03:38:56,379
That sounds like you're stepping in snow.

3212
03:38:56,379 --> 03:38:57,100
I like this sound.

3213
03:38:59,149 --> 03:38:59,649
Ow.

3214
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:02,270
Dude, this is actually so good.

3215
03:39:02,989 --> 03:39:05,120
Who the fuck is this?

3216
03:39:05,680 --> 03:39:06,959
No, that's yo-yo, never mind.

3217
03:39:08,260 --> 03:39:08,819
What'd you just drop?

3218
03:39:09,780 --> 03:39:10,739
Vanquisher medal?

3219
03:39:11,870 --> 03:39:12,670
Ignore it.

3220
03:39:12,670 --> 03:39:22,350
Oh, okay.

3221
03:39:22,350 --> 03:39:23,069
So, um.

3222
03:39:26,510 --> 03:39:28,270
I think this might need to be longer.

3223
03:39:29,229 --> 03:39:29,729
Longer?

3224
03:39:30,829 --> 03:39:31,329
Yeah.

3225
03:39:32,510 --> 03:39:33,549
I'm concerned.

3226
03:39:36,659 --> 03:39:37,159
All right.

3227
03:39:37,559 --> 03:39:40,120
Grats on 150 health bat kills.

3228
03:39:40,120 --> 03:39:40,620
Thank you.

3229
03:39:41,239 --> 03:39:44,120
You're still not at 400 health, are you?

3230
03:39:44,120 --> 03:39:44,620
No.

3231
03:39:44,680 --> 03:39:45,180
350.

3232
03:39:49,280 --> 03:39:51,440
I didn't bring any building materials or anything.

3233
03:39:55,809 --> 03:39:57,170
This is still not long enough?

3234
03:40:01,170 --> 03:40:02,850
How long does this gotta be?

3235
03:40:02,850 --> 03:40:04,129
It might be, but I want to be sure.

3236
03:40:04,129 --> 03:40:06,370
Because if you reach the end and the boss isn't dead yet,

3237
03:40:06,370 --> 03:40:09,010
then you're like in a panic jumping over lava pits and stuff.

3238
03:40:09,809 --> 03:40:12,370
And like trying to work your way through houses while it kills you.

3239
03:40:13,250 --> 03:40:16,260
Well, I'm just gonna start grabbing material then.

3240
03:40:20,209 --> 03:40:21,969
Either it's long enough or it isn't.

3241
03:40:21,969 --> 03:40:22,469
Yeah.

3242
03:40:24,879 --> 03:40:27,040
And I'd rather it be long enough, you know?

3243
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:37,479
I'm probably just gonna dynamite it, actually.

3244
03:40:37,479 --> 03:40:38,760
We're normal and we should be fine.

3245
03:40:39,479 --> 03:40:43,409
All right, so...

3246
03:40:44,610 --> 03:40:48,399
Once we get to the other side of this building, we'll do it.

3247
03:40:49,120 --> 03:40:50,379
Okay.

3248
03:41:06,120 --> 03:41:07,879
This is relaxing.

3249
03:41:09,479 --> 03:41:10,040
I'm going for it.

3250
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:11,000
I'm building the thing up.

3251
03:41:12,639 --> 03:41:13,440
No, we're good.

3252
03:41:13,440 --> 03:41:14,319
We're good.

3253
03:41:14,319 --> 03:41:14,819
Just come here.

3254
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:17,360
Wait, we're done doing it?

3255
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:17,860
We're good?

3256
03:41:17,860 --> 03:41:18,639
Yeah, yeah, just come here, come here.

3257
03:41:18,639 --> 03:41:19,139
All right.

3258
03:41:19,780 --> 03:41:23,940
Uh, hand to me gently the voodoo doll.

3259
03:41:27,700 --> 03:41:29,139
And the obsidian potion.

3260
03:41:29,139 --> 03:41:31,780
Okay, gently hand you the voodoo doll.

3261
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:35,479
There it is.

3262
03:41:35,479 --> 03:41:36,440
Okay, gently.

3263
03:41:36,440 --> 03:41:37,319
Why, is it gonna break?

3264
03:41:37,959 --> 03:41:38,680
Gently.

3265
03:41:39,879 --> 03:41:45,420
Okay, and how do I split the potions in half to give you one?

3266
03:41:46,059 --> 03:41:46,620
I'm just gonna drink it.

3267
03:41:46,620 --> 03:41:49,260
Can you right-click it a second time over your inventory or something?

3268
03:41:49,260 --> 03:41:50,620
Or you hold right-click when you pick it?

3269
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:52,360
Something like that.

3270
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:54,280
It's just right-click.

3271
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:56,120
Okay, um, I have a potion here for you.

3272
03:41:59,770 --> 03:42:00,649
Here it comes.

3273
03:42:00,649 --> 03:42:03,479
Okay.

3274
03:42:03,479 --> 03:42:04,840
Okay, Jerma, did you get it?

3275
03:42:08,540 --> 03:42:10,379
So, um, drinking it.

3276
03:42:10,379 --> 03:42:12,379
Uh, are we, are we, are we doing this now?

3277
03:42:12,379 --> 03:42:14,860
Should I press B and drink everything?

3278
03:42:14,860 --> 03:42:15,579
We're doing this.

3279
03:42:15,579 --> 03:42:15,979
Okay.

3280
03:42:15,979 --> 03:42:17,020
Summon up your, uh...

3281
03:42:17,739 --> 03:42:18,459
Why am I on fire?

3282
03:42:19,260 --> 03:42:20,059
Do things.

3283
03:42:20,059 --> 03:42:20,780
Why am I on fire?

3284
03:42:21,579 --> 03:42:22,219
Why am I burning?

3285
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:23,819
Why am I burning?

3286
03:42:24,700 --> 03:42:25,899
Let's just get the fuck out of me.

3287
03:42:25,899 --> 03:42:26,399
Okay.

3288
03:42:27,750 --> 03:42:28,309
You ready?

3289
03:42:29,030 --> 03:42:29,989
That was insane.

3290
03:42:29,989 --> 03:42:31,350
Okay, I'm, uh, I'm ready.

3291
03:42:32,069 --> 03:42:33,989
I've got my thing summoned.

3292
03:42:34,950 --> 03:42:35,510
Kill that boy.

3293
03:42:35,510 --> 03:42:37,510
What you have to do is throw the voodoo doll into the...

3294
03:42:38,069 --> 03:42:38,790
Oh.

3295
03:42:38,790 --> 03:42:39,430
Here it goes.

3296
03:42:41,559 --> 03:42:43,000
And then we just attack.

3297
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:43,479
Thing.

3298
03:42:43,479 --> 03:42:45,000
Then we attack and walk backwards.

3299
03:42:45,879 --> 03:42:50,579
Okay, start walking backwards.

3300
03:42:51,459 --> 03:42:52,659
I'm dropping dynamite, so...

3301
03:42:58,299 --> 03:42:59,420
Keep going.

3302
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:06,239
Oh, yeah.

3303
03:43:07,100 --> 03:43:08,780
I said it wasn't long enough.

3304
03:43:08,780 --> 03:43:09,899
I didn't think I was gonna actually...

3305
03:43:09,899 --> 03:43:10,399
What? He's dead?

3306
03:43:12,139 --> 03:43:12,639
Yeah.

3307
03:43:15,139 --> 03:43:16,659
The last second, I was like, you know what?

3308
03:43:16,659 --> 03:43:17,620
We went...

3309
03:43:17,620 --> 03:43:19,620
We did so much.

3310
03:43:19,620 --> 03:43:21,620
We needed, like, 35 feet.

3311
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:24,020
Yeah, we were a little over-prepared.

3312
03:43:28,579 --> 03:43:29,219
Wow.

3313
03:43:29,219 --> 03:43:29,860
That's funny.

3314
03:43:33,430 --> 03:43:36,149
We needed, like, a couple of hallways.

3315
03:43:36,149 --> 03:43:36,709
We made...

3316
03:43:38,180 --> 03:43:41,780
Oh my fucking god, dude.

3317
03:43:42,500 --> 03:43:43,459
Are you serious?

3318
03:43:43,459 --> 03:43:43,959
I'm sorry!

3319
03:43:44,659 --> 03:43:47,139
That was, like, the last 40 minutes of this stream.

3320
03:43:49,829 --> 03:43:51,829
No, I did a lot of other things.

3321
03:43:51,829 --> 03:43:53,030
I built a lot of items.

3322
03:43:55,940 --> 03:43:57,860
We needed from here to here.

3323
03:44:01,459 --> 03:44:03,299
Holy shit, you were not confident at all.

3324
03:44:03,299 --> 03:44:04,020
That's so funny.

3325
03:44:07,190 --> 03:44:08,629
That's what you call overkill.

3326
03:44:08,629 --> 03:44:10,309
Yeah. Hey, well, look.

3327
03:44:10,309 --> 03:44:10,790
It's over.

3328
03:44:10,790 --> 03:44:11,590
We win.

3329
03:44:11,590 --> 03:44:12,950
You should have got a couple items

3330
03:44:12,950 --> 03:44:14,549
and everything that he drops is good.

3331
03:44:15,270 --> 03:44:16,389
Okay, wall of flesh.

3332
03:44:21,610 --> 03:44:22,969
Prepare to face the terrors that lurk

3333
03:44:22,969 --> 03:44:24,489
in the light and dark parts of this world.

3334
03:44:24,489 --> 03:44:27,370
Place in your inventory to gain increased item grab range.

3335
03:44:28,090 --> 03:44:29,209
Yeah, I trashed mine.

3336
03:44:29,930 --> 03:44:34,280
Unfortunately for them, they were twisted

3337
03:44:34,280 --> 03:44:36,040
by their inner demons until they were beyond saving.

3338
03:44:36,040 --> 03:44:36,840
The underworld.

3339
03:44:39,579 --> 03:44:41,579
Wild cleric emblem.

3340
03:44:42,459 --> 03:44:48,200
12% increased radiant damage.

3341
03:44:48,760 --> 03:44:50,680
Healing spells will heal an additional one life.

3342
03:44:51,399 --> 03:44:53,989
That's a Beerus healer, okay.

3343
03:44:53,989 --> 03:44:54,709
Shadow diamond.

3344
03:44:57,209 --> 03:44:59,450
Arcane summoner emblem.

3345
03:45:02,260 --> 03:45:04,219
Now that's some good shit.

3346
03:45:07,989 --> 03:45:10,469
15% increased summon damage in plus 20 mana.

3347
03:45:10,469 --> 03:45:11,270
What do I replace?

3348
03:45:14,389 --> 03:45:15,510
I cloud.

3349
03:45:15,510 --> 03:45:17,190
I don't even need cloud in a bottle anymore, do I?

3350
03:45:17,190 --> 03:45:17,829
Because I can fly.

3351
03:45:18,549 --> 03:45:21,100
It's tech right.

3352
03:45:21,899 --> 03:45:23,260
I don't need cloud anymore.

3353
03:45:23,260 --> 03:45:24,620
You probably don't need it now.

3354
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:25,659
No, I'm just going to put that on.

3355
03:45:25,659 --> 03:45:26,860
I'm going to update it.

3356
03:45:26,860 --> 03:45:27,659
Oh, fuck, fuck.

3357
03:45:27,659 --> 03:45:29,340
This is the tax collector.

3358
03:45:30,219 --> 03:45:31,100
That's awesome.

3359
03:45:31,739 --> 03:45:34,579
Well, I don't have purification powder.

3360
03:45:35,930 --> 03:45:36,889
Replace the bees.

3361
03:45:36,889 --> 03:45:38,649
Oh, I like the defense on the bees still.

3362
03:45:39,450 --> 03:45:40,889
It still looks seems pretty good.

3363
03:45:44,409 --> 03:45:49,450
You can start showing the goblin your accessories

3364
03:45:49,450 --> 03:45:53,049
so you can try and roll like plus four defense on every accessory you have.

3365
03:45:53,049 --> 03:45:54,090
Oh, that's cool.

3366
03:45:54,090 --> 03:45:56,409
So if there's one that like, oh, this one doesn't have the defense,

3367
03:45:56,409 --> 03:45:59,129
you can just try and roll it depending on what it costs.

3368
03:45:59,129 --> 03:46:00,010
Cool.

3369
03:46:00,010 --> 03:46:03,129
Is there a certain stat that a caster or summoner should be looking for?

3370
03:46:03,129 --> 03:46:05,450
Like plus one to more monsters or something?

3371
03:46:06,170 --> 03:46:07,690
Defense is like the best one.

3372
03:46:07,690 --> 03:46:08,329
Just defense.

3373
03:46:08,329 --> 03:46:09,530
Look for defense every time.

3374
03:46:11,209 --> 03:46:15,000
All right, so the goblin is back at the town, right?

3375
03:46:15,879 --> 03:46:16,379
Yep.

3376
03:46:17,159 --> 03:46:17,879
Well, that's cool.

3377
03:46:18,840 --> 03:46:22,200
Um, so now there's a lot of things going on.

3378
03:46:22,200 --> 03:46:23,799
I'm staying down here for like one second

3379
03:46:23,799 --> 03:46:26,200
to get a couple of essences for a super OP weapon.

3380
03:46:30,360 --> 03:46:33,239
And this game is really fun.

3381
03:46:35,659 --> 03:46:37,739
I'm like, I like, don't know what I'm doing still,

3382
03:46:37,739 --> 03:46:39,260
like kind of learning a little.

3383
03:46:39,260 --> 03:46:41,180
But like, this is, this is like really cool.

3384
03:46:42,379 --> 03:46:44,149
There's like so many things.

3385
03:46:45,030 --> 03:46:46,700
There are a lot of things.

3386
03:46:47,579 --> 03:46:53,100
All right, let me, uh, let's talk about the goblin you said, right?

3387
03:46:53,819 --> 03:46:57,319
So you're talking about reforge?

3388
03:46:59,540 --> 03:47:00,040
Yeah.

3389
03:47:00,579 --> 03:47:03,020
Is this going to do it automatically or do I get to look at it?

3390
03:47:03,989 --> 03:47:05,750
Uh, it's a random roll.

3391
03:47:05,750 --> 03:47:06,250
Oh.

3392
03:47:06,790 --> 03:47:09,899
And it's, it's going to roll like the thing that's green, right?

3393
03:47:10,620 --> 03:47:11,120
Yeah.

3394
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:12,379
Does it, what does it cost?

3395
03:47:13,579 --> 03:47:14,940
It'll tell you when you put the item in.

3396
03:47:14,940 --> 03:47:15,659
Depends on item.

3397
03:47:16,459 --> 03:47:18,360
Three gold, that's it?

3398
03:47:19,159 --> 03:47:20,940
Yeah, the melee speed.

3399
03:47:20,940 --> 03:47:22,379
I'm not, that, that, that sucks on here.

3400
03:47:28,250 --> 03:47:29,690
So I'm looking for anything else really.

3401
03:47:30,250 --> 03:47:39,260
Did it work?

3402
03:47:39,260 --> 03:47:40,059
Am I missing something?

3403
03:47:47,270 --> 03:47:48,309
I don't have enough gold.

3404
03:47:50,899 --> 03:47:51,620
Right.

3405
03:47:51,620 --> 03:47:52,120
Okay.

3406
03:47:54,340 --> 03:48:03,450
Come here, come here, come here.

3407
03:48:11,479 --> 03:48:11,879
Hmm.

3408
03:48:11,879 --> 03:48:13,079
3% movement speed.

3409
03:48:16,090 --> 03:48:17,690
A schmelve.

3410
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:20,620
Why is this stacking burn?

3411
03:48:21,659 --> 03:48:22,159
Okay.

3412
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:24,000
That's not bad.

3413
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:27,899
This one already has four defense.

3414
03:48:28,540 --> 03:48:31,420
I feel like the 4% movement speed on this is, does, is dumb.

3415
03:48:32,659 --> 03:48:33,159
Yeah.

3416
03:48:33,379 --> 03:48:34,420
It's, it's not enough.

3417
03:48:35,059 --> 03:48:40,629
I mean, it's nice because movement speed is like not dying in Toraria, but

3418
03:48:41,590 --> 03:48:43,989
eh, you're really going to have to stack it.

3419
03:48:48,329 --> 03:48:48,569
All right.

3420
03:48:48,569 --> 03:48:51,930
I'm going to, that, that fleeting cloud in the bottle is just trash.

3421
03:48:51,930 --> 03:48:52,729
Now I can just sell it, right?

3422
03:48:54,120 --> 03:48:55,639
Um, don't sell it.

3423
03:48:55,639 --> 03:48:56,280
Don't sell it.

3424
03:48:56,280 --> 03:48:56,780
Okay.

3425
03:48:57,399 --> 03:49:00,520
We need it to keep like, that's why I'm so afraid to sell anything.

3426
03:49:00,520 --> 03:49:02,200
Cause I feel like it might be needed later.

3427
03:49:02,200 --> 03:49:03,559
I explained this a long time ago.

3428
03:49:04,520 --> 03:49:06,840
And that's why I'm saying it.

3429
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:07,340
Listen.

3430
03:49:08,360 --> 03:49:13,959
When you look at an item, if on the item it says material, then you might need it.

3431
03:49:13,959 --> 03:49:14,280
Right.

3432
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:18,170
If it doesn't say material and you don't need it, you'll never need it.

3433
03:49:19,959 --> 03:49:22,360
Everything says material on it.

3434
03:49:22,360 --> 03:49:25,739
There's like one thing that doesn't.

3435
03:49:25,739 --> 03:49:26,299
Angry, okay.

3436
03:49:26,299 --> 03:49:27,180
Angry ball and chain.

3437
03:49:27,180 --> 03:49:27,899
Can I just sell that?

3438
03:49:30,200 --> 03:49:32,920
Uh, doesn't say material.

3439
03:49:32,920 --> 03:49:33,479
Hold on a minute.

3440
03:49:34,280 --> 03:49:36,360
No, this thing increases defense by eight.

3441
03:49:39,850 --> 03:49:40,889
It slows you, I think.

3442
03:49:41,690 --> 03:49:45,319
That's pretty good.

3443
03:49:46,040 --> 03:49:46,680
I can fly.

3444
03:49:47,739 --> 03:49:56,100
Oh, yeah.

3445
03:49:56,100 --> 03:49:57,780
I think we needed this whole walkway.

3446
03:49:58,659 --> 03:49:59,159
Huh?

3447
03:50:00,739 --> 03:50:00,979
Yeah.

3448
03:50:00,979 --> 03:50:02,579
This walkway could be longer is all I'm saying.

3449
03:50:08,309 --> 03:50:10,709
I need to get like two more essences of chaos.

3450
03:50:13,379 --> 03:50:15,700
I'm going to make like, I'm going to be making a mistake here.

3451
03:50:15,700 --> 03:50:17,540
Someone's going to scream at me because they're going to see

3452
03:50:17,540 --> 03:50:19,700
that I'm like selling something I'm not supposed to be.

3453
03:50:33,030 --> 03:50:34,229
Honestly, I'm not afraid.

3454
03:50:34,229 --> 03:50:35,750
Mandible bow.

3455
03:50:35,750 --> 03:50:37,110
Not after that last bite.

3456
03:50:37,110 --> 03:50:38,950
It's not, none of these are materials though.

3457
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:39,430
Like harpoon.

3458
03:50:39,430 --> 03:50:41,030
Oh, the guide is still dead.

3459
03:50:43,530 --> 03:50:44,329
Mandible bow.

3460
03:50:44,329 --> 03:50:45,450
Like this stuff sucks.

3461
03:50:45,450 --> 03:50:46,090
Does it just sell?

3462
03:50:46,090 --> 03:50:46,590
Yeah.

3463
03:50:47,129 --> 03:50:47,629
Just sell it.

3464
03:50:51,799 --> 03:50:53,000
What about this ancient shiv?

3465
03:50:53,559 --> 03:50:54,280
Not material.

3466
03:50:58,520 --> 03:50:59,639
Mandible claws.

3467
03:50:59,639 --> 03:51:01,159
Like these things are dumb, right?

3468
03:51:01,879 --> 03:51:02,600
Yeah.

3469
03:51:02,600 --> 03:51:03,479
Yeah, you're getting it.

3470
03:51:03,479 --> 03:51:03,799
You're getting it.

3471
03:51:03,799 --> 03:51:04,680
I'm not understanding.

3472
03:51:04,680 --> 03:51:05,559
Severed hands.

3473
03:51:05,559 --> 03:51:06,200
Get rid of them.

3474
03:51:07,159 --> 03:51:08,520
Auto trash those severed hands.

3475
03:51:08,520 --> 03:51:09,079
I told you.

3476
03:51:09,079 --> 03:51:10,200
It's going to be slicer.

3477
03:51:10,200 --> 03:51:10,760
Get rid of them.

3478
03:51:11,639 --> 03:51:13,540
Who needs them?

3479
03:51:13,540 --> 03:51:14,040
Nobody.

3480
03:51:15,579 --> 03:51:15,819
All right.

3481
03:51:15,819 --> 03:51:16,780
Let's see how that gets me.

3482
03:51:16,780 --> 03:51:18,139
Demonic carnage.

3483
03:51:18,139 --> 03:51:19,100
What is this doing in here?

3484
03:51:21,500 --> 03:51:23,100
63 melee damage.

3485
03:51:24,840 --> 03:51:25,959
Fast speed 15.

3486
03:51:25,959 --> 03:51:27,159
What the fuck is this in here?

3487
03:51:27,879 --> 03:51:29,319
Oh, I was using that.

3488
03:51:29,319 --> 03:51:30,600
I'm not using it anymore.

3489
03:51:30,600 --> 03:51:31,100
What?

3490
03:51:36,540 --> 03:51:38,940
It's pretty okay, but you need to build really high defense

3491
03:51:40,110 --> 03:51:41,549
and like melee stats.

3492
03:51:42,520 --> 03:51:45,479
Otherwise, you're going to take so much damage trying to use that weapon.

3493
03:51:45,479 --> 03:51:47,239
The harpoon, do anything cool, it's a material.

3494
03:51:48,559 --> 03:51:50,889
I don't think so.

3495
03:51:52,139 --> 03:51:54,620
You can check with the guide, but I don't think it does.

3496
03:51:55,340 --> 03:52:02,250
It's not like it sells for 26 silver.

3497
03:52:09,469 --> 03:52:10,270
Wait, what's going on?

3498
03:52:10,909 --> 03:52:13,209
Why is everybody losing their mind?

3499
03:52:13,930 --> 03:52:26,010
Oh, this is one of those stupid melee damage weapons that aren't melee.

3500
03:52:30,000 --> 03:52:32,239
Now let me try to reroll this again.

3501
03:52:35,209 --> 03:52:37,209
Why does the price come down every time I do it?

3502
03:52:37,930 --> 03:52:43,920
It was three gold last time, now it's 275.

3503
03:52:49,879 --> 03:52:50,600
That's not good.

3504
03:52:52,489 --> 03:52:53,850
Two percent, I went down.

3505
03:52:57,870 --> 03:53:00,030
Two percent melee speed instead of four.

3506
03:53:17,500 --> 03:53:18,620
I only have three gold.

3507
03:53:18,620 --> 03:53:21,260
Yeah, there's a, wait, I have more than that.

3508
03:53:22,059 --> 03:53:23,579
I got way more gold than that.

3509
03:53:24,219 --> 03:53:28,670
This weapon's really good.

3510
03:53:31,629 --> 03:53:40,670
Okay, get up here, turtle.

3511
03:53:41,309 --> 03:53:51,870
Oh yeah, we need to go get you the crazy summon.

3512
03:53:54,559 --> 03:53:55,840
Pig's not going to get hit by the lava?

3513
03:54:03,579 --> 03:54:04,940
Don't kill the pig.

3514
03:54:04,940 --> 03:54:06,940
All right, I just looked over at Chad and I almost died.

3515
03:54:06,940 --> 03:54:08,459
This pig was easy.

3516
03:54:08,459 --> 03:54:10,940
That's because the air is blowing fast.

3517
03:54:12,059 --> 03:54:13,819
The air is fast, dude.

3518
03:54:13,819 --> 03:54:15,899
The wind is going nuts right now.

3519
03:54:20,639 --> 03:54:21,120
One more.

3520
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:26,010
I feel like I'm in need of a new staff.

3521
03:54:30,860 --> 03:54:34,459
There is an insanely good one that we can get you pretty soon.

3522
03:54:35,260 --> 03:54:44,780
I do, I like this one, but I need to do more damage.

3523
03:54:45,420 --> 03:54:49,579
So one of the first things you do within hard mode is you have to fight

3524
03:54:49,579 --> 03:54:53,340
basically the same bosses you fought before but harder that are mechanical bosses.

3525
03:54:53,340 --> 03:54:56,059
So like the worm we fought is like the mechanical worm.

3526
03:54:57,020 --> 03:55:00,700
And I think it's them that drop hollowed bars and the hollowed staff is actually

3527
03:55:00,700 --> 03:55:02,139
really, really, really, really, really good.

3528
03:55:02,940 --> 03:55:03,260
Really?

3529
03:55:05,629 --> 03:55:06,430
Really.

3530
03:55:06,430 --> 03:55:13,149
The wind is too strong.

3531
03:55:14,030 --> 03:55:16,559
I can't get back in that house.

3532
03:55:19,719 --> 03:55:20,280
Use your hook.

3533
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:23,879
Oh, right.

3534
03:55:23,879 --> 03:55:26,920
Also, if you hook a closed door and open it, you go whoosh.

3535
03:55:29,360 --> 03:55:30,079
Oh, come on.

3536
03:55:30,879 --> 03:55:32,639
All right, all right.

3537
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:34,079
Got it.

3538
03:55:34,079 --> 03:55:38,079
Plus three defense and plus 0.75% damage reduction.

3539
03:55:38,879 --> 03:55:40,750
Nice.

3540
03:55:40,750 --> 03:55:46,729
Oh yeah, that's also the only thing you can get is damage reduction.

3541
03:55:47,450 --> 03:55:53,229
So the extra movement speed on the quick lightning boots.

3542
03:55:54,110 --> 03:55:55,260
Why even have that?

3543
03:55:55,260 --> 03:55:56,620
Why not just roll something else?

3544
03:55:56,620 --> 03:55:57,180
They're already quick.

3545
03:55:57,180 --> 03:55:58,540
They're at 14 gold, never mind.

3546
03:56:02,280 --> 03:56:03,159
There's a good reason.

3547
03:56:03,159 --> 03:56:04,040
That's a pretty good reason.

3548
03:56:12,969 --> 03:56:15,930
All right, I'm going to put this other stuff in here.

3549
03:56:15,930 --> 03:56:19,209
I've got like wild cleric emblem, the underworld.

3550
03:56:20,909 --> 03:56:22,590
I'll keep the wall of flesh in the inventory, right?

3551
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:25,500
If you want.

3552
03:56:26,540 --> 03:56:28,379
If you care about that kind of bonus.

3553
03:56:28,940 --> 03:56:30,700
I mean, it's kind of a good thing.

3554
03:56:36,139 --> 03:56:36,940
Shadow diamonds.

3555
03:56:37,739 --> 03:56:40,299
I'm just telling you what I picked up because I want to be able.

3556
03:56:40,299 --> 03:56:43,100
Oh, well, she told me about the shadow diamonds.

3557
03:56:45,399 --> 03:56:47,200
No, no.

3558
03:56:47,200 --> 03:56:49,209
No, never mind.

3559
03:56:50,459 --> 03:56:50,860
Buy a piggy bank.

3560
03:56:50,860 --> 03:56:52,219
You can put those in the storage, though.

3561
03:56:54,540 --> 03:56:55,420
Buy a piggy bank.

3562
03:56:57,719 --> 03:56:59,559
Does it do you get like a return on investment?

3563
03:56:59,559 --> 03:57:00,760
Do you get like a percentage increase?

3564
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:04,889
Piggy bank is kind of annoying to use, but it's really good.

3565
03:57:04,889 --> 03:57:10,280
You put items inside of it and you can place it on the ground.

3566
03:57:10,280 --> 03:57:12,120
So it's like a second storage.

3567
03:57:12,120 --> 03:57:15,950
Oh, oh, that's all right.

3568
03:57:15,950 --> 03:57:18,190
So like if at any point you're like, oh, shit, my inventory is full.

3569
03:57:18,190 --> 03:57:20,989
You place that you can put shit in the piggy bank.

3570
03:57:20,989 --> 03:57:24,030
And yeah, I don't like dealing with it myself.

3571
03:57:24,030 --> 03:57:25,639
But it's worth it.

3572
03:57:25,639 --> 03:57:26,760
Well, maybe eventually.

3573
03:57:33,049 --> 03:57:36,809
OK, I am ready.

3574
03:57:41,290 --> 03:57:44,889
I'm just trying to farm minions so I can get a thing.

3575
03:57:45,690 --> 03:57:48,889
If you go to the snow biome and you just start killing shit,

3576
03:57:48,889 --> 03:57:51,450
there's this one like flying around enemy

3577
03:57:53,840 --> 03:57:55,520
that you're going to need to kill a couple of.

3578
03:57:56,319 --> 03:58:00,399
And that's what drops the summon and is the super good summon.

3579
03:58:00,399 --> 03:58:03,440
So you're telling me snow biome, I don't have to go up.

3580
03:58:05,690 --> 03:58:08,010
Press M and I look for snow.

3581
03:58:08,010 --> 03:58:13,340
Yeah, the snow up in the cloud or is that a cloud?

3582
03:58:17,200 --> 03:58:17,920
That's a cloud.

3583
03:58:17,920 --> 03:58:18,639
That's a cloud.

3584
03:58:18,639 --> 03:58:20,559
OK, I do see the snow.

3585
03:58:22,250 --> 03:58:24,569
The snow is at the top of the corruption to the right.

3586
03:58:24,569 --> 03:58:25,450
Yeah, I see.

3587
03:58:25,450 --> 03:58:28,329
So it's going to be a little annoying because it combines two enemies types.

3588
03:58:30,399 --> 03:58:35,520
But yeah, also, now that it's in hard mode, there's like the regular enemies will hurt you.

3589
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:36,239
So be careful.

3590
03:58:36,879 --> 03:58:40,079
All right, I will go kill the things down there.

3591
03:58:40,079 --> 03:58:46,729
Also, collect snow blocks because then you can make the upgrade to your boots

3592
03:58:46,729 --> 03:58:48,809
and leather if you find any.

3593
03:58:48,809 --> 03:58:49,489
Aye, aye.

3594
03:58:50,670 --> 03:58:52,030
Aye, aye, aye.

3595
03:58:52,670 --> 03:58:57,680
I just tried to double tap D to run fast.

3596
03:58:59,280 --> 03:58:59,920
DD.

3597
03:58:59,920 --> 03:59:00,479
Like, didn't.

3598
03:59:10,010 --> 03:59:10,809
But why though?

3599
03:59:16,670 --> 03:59:17,629
But why though?

3600
03:59:17,629 --> 03:59:19,549
Oh, stop getting so close.

3601
03:59:21,739 --> 03:59:22,139
Hello?

3602
03:59:23,100 --> 03:59:23,579
Hello?

3603
03:59:24,700 --> 03:59:25,100
Hello?

3604
03:59:26,139 --> 03:59:28,270
Hello?

3605
03:59:29,149 --> 03:59:29,629
Hello?

3606
03:59:30,909 --> 03:59:32,270
Hey, hello, right?

3607
03:59:32,270 --> 03:59:32,829
Oh, yeah.

3608
03:59:32,829 --> 03:59:33,309
Yeah, right.

3609
03:59:33,309 --> 03:59:34,030
You think you're funny.

3610
03:59:34,030 --> 03:59:34,510
Hello?

3611
03:59:36,510 --> 03:59:37,149
Hello?

3612
03:59:37,149 --> 03:59:39,120
Let me drop in.

3613
03:59:39,120 --> 03:59:40,520
That guy took a lot of hits.

3614
03:59:41,239 --> 03:59:50,879
You're still not at 400 health, are you?

3615
03:59:50,879 --> 03:59:51,040
No.

3616
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:54,409
That's what I like about you.

3617
03:59:55,049 --> 03:59:58,090
Hey, thanks.

3618
03:59:58,889 --> 04:00:00,959
You're like not afraid.

3619
04:00:02,250 --> 04:00:03,610
I've made it to the snow.

3620
04:00:04,250 --> 04:00:08,270
Is this snow?

3621
04:00:08,270 --> 04:00:09,549
This is like ice, right?

3622
04:00:09,549 --> 04:00:10,110
This is ice.

3623
04:00:13,319 --> 04:00:16,559
Carnivore tail.

3624
04:00:16,559 --> 04:00:17,840
Oh, what's that?

3625
04:00:17,840 --> 04:00:18,799
Can't look at it.

3626
04:00:18,799 --> 04:00:19,920
I just that hurts a lot.

3627
04:00:40,440 --> 04:00:43,399
You weren't kidding when you said that this there, but much, much harder.

3628
04:00:43,399 --> 04:00:43,559
No.

3629
04:00:44,520 --> 04:00:48,920
Also, if you see something spawn in the eye and the air after you kill something,

3630
04:00:48,920 --> 04:00:52,299
that's like a crown and it like doesn't move.

3631
04:00:52,299 --> 04:00:54,780
Like it's stuck in the air and doesn't drop to the floor.

3632
04:00:55,500 --> 04:00:56,219
Pick those up.

3633
04:00:56,219 --> 04:00:59,340
Essences like essence of sunlight, essence of ice.

3634
04:00:59,340 --> 04:01:00,459
Maybe I don't remember what it's called.

3635
04:01:00,459 --> 04:01:01,020
Do I have it?

3636
04:01:01,020 --> 04:01:02,780
I don't even like that.

3637
04:01:02,780 --> 04:01:03,420
Well, that's not good.

3638
04:01:04,620 --> 04:01:06,569
Bad.

3639
04:01:06,569 --> 04:01:07,370
I don't have any fucking.

3640
04:01:08,649 --> 04:01:14,510
Hey, I found some torches.

3641
04:01:22,729 --> 04:01:23,209
Good thing.

3642
04:01:23,209 --> 04:01:26,090
Like idiot me was able to like save this run.

3643
04:01:32,479 --> 04:01:35,920
See me in the past knew about me in the future.

3644
04:01:51,840 --> 04:01:54,000
In fact, let's just go ahead and like take them all.

3645
04:01:58,879 --> 04:02:00,639
I am about to roll.

3646
04:02:00,639 --> 04:02:02,399
There's a lot of fucking people over there.

3647
04:02:03,360 --> 04:02:08,809
These things are not doing very much damage at all.

3648
04:02:09,370 --> 04:02:14,959
What things?

3649
04:02:16,750 --> 04:02:17,629
My summons.

3650
04:02:18,829 --> 04:02:22,959
Yeah, they're a little outdated at this point.

3651
04:02:22,959 --> 04:02:25,040
So you're saying snow area.

3652
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:26,159
Snow ice block, right?

3653
04:02:27,120 --> 04:02:27,920
Not snow block.

3654
04:02:30,600 --> 04:02:32,520
I think it's snow block.

3655
04:02:32,520 --> 04:02:33,239
Is it snow?

3656
04:02:33,239 --> 04:02:35,000
Because I can get snow right now.

3657
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:35,879
Yeah, it's no block.

3658
04:02:36,840 --> 04:02:47,469
How many do we need?

3659
04:02:50,459 --> 04:02:58,319
I mean, describe once you need 20 to make the ice skates,

3660
04:02:58,319 --> 04:03:00,399
which is really what you're in it for, you know?

3661
04:03:00,399 --> 04:03:02,159
Yeah, that's true.

3662
04:03:02,799 --> 04:03:11,389
I feel really bad.

3663
04:03:11,389 --> 04:03:13,870
I spent this much time like crafting this fucking bow.

3664
04:03:14,670 --> 04:03:15,229
It sucks.

3665
04:03:16,040 --> 04:03:20,200
I immediately got this throwing weapon that I think is better.

3666
04:03:21,790 --> 04:03:22,510
It's hard to tell.

3667
04:03:31,079 --> 04:03:33,000
And then what was the enemy that I was looking for down here?

3668
04:03:34,719 --> 04:03:35,760
I don't know how to describe it.

3669
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:37,360
Usually it's above ground.

3670
04:03:37,360 --> 04:03:39,280
I'm not entirely sure if it shows up above the ground.

3671
04:03:40,729 --> 04:03:51,280
But you know, in the corruption, the flying eyes with the tusks?

3672
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:57,680
Yeah, it's like that, but it's semi-transparent and icy.

3673
04:03:57,680 --> 04:03:58,159
Okay.

3674
04:03:58,159 --> 04:03:59,200
See, I just saw it.

3675
04:03:59,840 --> 04:04:00,479
I just died.

3676
04:04:00,479 --> 04:04:02,959
Okay, you're going to need to kill it.

3677
04:04:02,959 --> 04:04:05,120
Like it's not 100% drop chance.

3678
04:04:05,120 --> 04:04:09,120
And the item I'm looking for is the thing to summon them.

3679
04:04:19,690 --> 04:04:20,329
Rotten chunk?

3680
04:04:22,700 --> 04:04:23,180
Don't care.

3681
04:04:23,739 --> 04:04:27,479
Jerm is not going to read my message.

3682
04:04:27,479 --> 04:04:28,600
Laughing my ass off.

3683
04:04:28,600 --> 04:04:29,000
Got you.

3684
04:04:30,520 --> 04:04:31,079
Got him.

3685
04:04:31,079 --> 04:04:31,559
Got him.

3686
04:04:32,520 --> 04:04:33,719
He's gonna get you.

3687
04:04:34,360 --> 04:04:35,879
To see you in the funny papers.

3688
04:04:36,920 --> 04:04:37,959
That's your go-to, isn't it?

3689
04:04:39,399 --> 04:04:39,719
Is it?

3690
04:04:41,819 --> 04:04:43,899
I think I have like 300 snow blocks.

3691
04:04:44,620 --> 04:04:46,959
Okay.

3692
04:04:46,959 --> 04:04:47,760
Yeah, you're good.

3693
04:04:49,040 --> 04:04:50,639
I kind of just kept going.

3694
04:04:50,639 --> 04:04:53,149
All right, let's do this.

3695
04:04:54,190 --> 04:04:55,340
Oh, nice.

3696
04:04:55,340 --> 04:04:56,139
These are good.

3697
04:04:56,139 --> 04:05:08,889
All right, looking for the rotten chunk carnivore tail.

3698
04:05:10,840 --> 04:05:11,479
Not down here.

3699
04:05:12,440 --> 04:05:16,489
He said they usually hang out above ground.

3700
04:05:18,780 --> 04:05:19,579
Oh, I'm pretty sure.

3701
04:05:20,139 --> 04:05:23,690
Come on, right here.

3702
04:05:24,489 --> 04:05:26,989
And it didn't look like you dropped it.

3703
04:05:26,989 --> 04:05:29,959
And I'm just a rotten chunk.

3704
04:05:29,959 --> 04:05:34,909
I have no idea what the chance is, but I've never like intentionally farmed them.

3705
04:05:34,909 --> 04:05:37,309
But every time I've gotten that, I've been a very happy boy.

3706
04:05:38,430 --> 04:05:38,670
Got him.

3707
04:05:38,670 --> 04:05:39,549
I'm gonna fucking die.

3708
04:05:42,479 --> 04:05:44,379
What happened?

3709
04:05:44,379 --> 04:05:45,420
It's your fault, dude.

3710
04:05:46,139 --> 04:05:46,700
Hello?

3711
04:05:46,700 --> 04:05:47,180
Dude.

3712
04:05:48,879 --> 04:05:50,239
It's all your fault, dude.

3713
04:05:51,639 --> 04:05:52,840
Come on, dude.

3714
04:05:52,840 --> 04:05:54,600
I can put some of this shit away, finally.

3715
04:05:58,879 --> 04:05:59,360
Dude.

3716
04:05:59,920 --> 04:06:01,680
Is it one of those things where I'll know when I see it?

3717
04:06:01,680 --> 04:06:02,639
Is it shiny or something?

3718
04:06:05,639 --> 04:06:06,440
I don't remember.

3719
04:06:07,319 --> 04:06:08,760
Like, it might be a staff.

3720
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:11,079
I mean, you'll check it if you see a random thing drop.

3721
04:06:11,959 --> 04:06:19,659
I didn't say hello to the soundboard.

3722
04:06:20,379 --> 04:06:22,510
I will if it happens again.

3723
04:06:22,510 --> 04:06:22,909
Hello?

3724
04:06:22,909 --> 04:06:23,309
Hello?

3725
04:06:24,540 --> 04:06:25,260
Hello?

3726
04:06:25,260 --> 04:06:25,899
Hey.

3727
04:06:25,899 --> 04:06:26,540
Hello?

3728
04:06:26,540 --> 04:06:26,940
Hello?

3729
04:06:27,739 --> 04:06:28,139
Hello?

3730
04:06:28,860 --> 04:06:29,500
That wasn't even me.

3731
04:06:30,139 --> 04:06:31,100
That's a whole new person.

3732
04:06:31,100 --> 04:06:31,979
You're not going to say hello?

3733
04:06:32,700 --> 04:06:33,100
Hello?

3734
04:06:33,579 --> 04:06:35,239
Hello?

3735
04:06:39,450 --> 04:06:39,850
Goodbye.

3736
04:06:41,290 --> 04:06:43,770
Now, how many hellos do you have?

3737
04:06:45,420 --> 04:06:46,139
Eight or nine.

3738
04:06:46,139 --> 04:06:46,379
No.

3739
04:06:47,020 --> 04:06:47,899
And one no.

3740
04:06:47,899 --> 04:06:48,940
I think I got it.

3741
04:06:48,940 --> 04:06:50,620
Is it a glacial crystal?

3742
04:06:51,420 --> 04:06:53,100
I don't know.

3743
04:06:54,590 --> 04:06:55,389
It's a quest item.

3744
04:06:55,389 --> 04:06:55,790
Wait, no.

3745
04:06:56,510 --> 04:06:58,059
I got it.

3746
04:06:58,940 --> 04:06:59,899
I got the quest item.

3747
04:07:03,870 --> 04:07:05,069
I see shard.

3748
04:07:05,069 --> 04:07:07,149
My armor gives three defense.

3749
04:07:07,149 --> 04:07:07,870
I see shard.

3750
04:07:08,510 --> 04:07:10,040
It's a staff.

3751
04:07:20,139 --> 04:07:21,500
God damn it, dude.

3752
04:07:21,500 --> 04:07:22,700
I hope I'm killing the right things.

3753
04:07:22,700 --> 04:07:23,420
I believe I am.

3754
04:07:27,719 --> 04:07:28,520
I see shard.

3755
04:07:29,159 --> 04:07:30,040
I see shard.

3756
04:07:30,760 --> 04:07:31,319
No.

3757
04:07:31,319 --> 04:07:31,879
What does it all do?

3758
04:07:31,879 --> 04:07:32,840
What's this?

3759
04:07:32,840 --> 04:07:33,719
Glacial crystal.

3760
04:07:35,000 --> 04:07:36,360
You can't pick up more than one of these.

3761
04:07:47,690 --> 04:07:50,250
The monster spawns in the underground ice biome.

3762
04:07:51,850 --> 04:07:53,930
This is not it here, what I'm attacking up.

3763
04:07:55,309 --> 04:07:58,909
Oh, I know they spawn there, but underground ice biome might be better.

3764
04:08:00,190 --> 04:08:03,950
Which is probably underneath where you are.

3765
04:08:03,950 --> 04:08:04,989
So just go underneath.

3766
04:08:09,260 --> 04:08:09,739
Yeah, it is.

3767
04:08:10,620 --> 04:08:11,739
There should be some down there.

3768
04:08:13,959 --> 04:08:14,200
All right.

3769
04:08:14,200 --> 04:08:15,239
Well, hold on a minute here.

3770
04:08:15,239 --> 04:08:15,719
Be careful.

3771
04:08:27,600 --> 04:08:28,399
Because I'm scared of this.

3772
04:08:28,399 --> 04:08:29,040
Where's my rope?

3773
04:08:29,680 --> 04:08:32,090
I don't know.

3774
04:08:37,690 --> 04:08:38,569
I need the guide.

3775
04:08:38,569 --> 04:08:41,450
I hate when the guide dies and then you get a whole new item.

3776
04:08:42,540 --> 04:08:43,020
What does this do?

3777
04:08:43,020 --> 04:08:44,860
And the guide's still dead because you went to hard mode

3778
04:08:44,860 --> 04:08:46,219
and you're like, come on, guide.

3779
04:08:47,100 --> 04:08:49,870
You know what I'm saying?

3780
04:08:51,309 --> 04:08:51,549
Yeah.

3781
04:08:52,350 --> 04:08:52,670
What?

3782
04:08:52,670 --> 04:08:53,309
Yeah, whatever.

3783
04:08:55,069 --> 04:08:56,329
Found him.

3784
04:08:56,329 --> 04:08:57,930
No, that's not an ice corrupter.

3785
04:08:57,930 --> 04:09:05,159
Hey, remember these ebb and stone blocks?

3786
04:09:06,760 --> 04:09:07,399
I have them now.

3787
04:09:08,809 --> 04:09:09,370
That's cool.

3788
04:09:10,250 --> 04:09:12,920
Remember like two hours ago when you were looking for these?

3789
04:09:14,360 --> 04:09:14,840
Got them now.

3790
04:09:14,840 --> 04:09:16,600
And I had to go get something real quick.

3791
04:09:17,159 --> 04:09:19,159
It's called an ice clasper.

3792
04:09:19,159 --> 04:09:19,399
Okay.

3793
04:09:21,340 --> 04:09:21,899
It is.

3794
04:09:21,899 --> 04:09:22,540
He's correct.

3795
04:09:23,180 --> 04:09:27,149
This is an actual statement just made.

3796
04:09:27,790 --> 04:09:33,129
My fingers feel like wet cat food.

3797
04:09:35,760 --> 04:09:38,479
What does it mean when you feel like wet cat food?

3798
04:09:42,219 --> 04:09:42,860
Are you all right?

3799
04:09:46,139 --> 04:09:46,860
No.

3800
04:09:46,860 --> 04:09:48,459
No, I'm not all right.

3801
04:09:48,459 --> 04:09:55,690
Okay.

3802
04:09:56,250 --> 04:09:57,209
Icy shard.

3803
04:09:58,090 --> 04:10:01,579
We're just going down.

3804
04:10:02,139 --> 04:10:05,739
I wish I brought bombs.

3805
04:10:06,700 --> 04:10:13,799
Can I get a better pickaxe?

3806
04:10:13,799 --> 04:10:15,799
I feel like it's been ages since I've got a new one.

3807
04:10:16,360 --> 04:10:19,129
How do I stop biting my fingernails?

3808
04:10:19,129 --> 04:10:19,850
Which one are you using?

3809
04:10:20,489 --> 04:10:21,530
Dip your fingers in vinegar.

3810
04:10:22,889 --> 04:10:23,450
Come on.

3811
04:10:23,450 --> 04:10:24,889
None of this water fucking count.

3812
04:10:25,850 --> 04:10:34,510
Uh, uh.

3813
04:10:34,510 --> 04:10:50,649
The purple ice block.

3814
04:10:50,649 --> 04:10:50,889
Cool.

3815
04:10:56,090 --> 04:10:57,209
Purple ice school.

3816
04:10:58,090 --> 04:10:59,690
I feel like I know what this tastes like.

3817
04:10:59,690 --> 04:11:01,290
I want to like crunch into this purple ice.

3818
04:11:02,250 --> 04:11:05,709
It's going to have that like a good fruit juicy grape kind of taste.

3819
04:11:10,750 --> 04:11:11,709
Okay, bro.

3820
04:11:12,430 --> 04:11:22,319
Come on, bro.

3821
04:11:22,319 --> 04:11:23,360
Ice block.

3822
04:11:23,360 --> 04:11:29,120
Maybe I should get some of this too.

3823
04:11:38,489 --> 04:11:38,809
All right.

3824
04:11:38,809 --> 04:11:39,930
Well, there's frost worm.

3825
04:11:39,930 --> 04:11:51,260
I didn't drop anything.

3826
04:11:57,040 --> 04:11:57,920
Did I upgrade my boots?

3827
04:11:57,920 --> 04:11:58,479
Yes, I did.

3828
04:12:07,559 --> 04:12:08,280
Yes, I did.

3829
04:12:08,280 --> 04:12:19,719
I'm trying to figure out like the best.

3830
04:12:19,719 --> 04:12:22,280
Should I just keep going down into the ice?

3831
04:12:22,280 --> 04:12:23,000
Just keep going?

3832
04:12:26,120 --> 04:12:28,760
I mean, this is clearly like we're getting down to like ice now.

3833
04:12:32,190 --> 04:12:32,989
Oh, I'm muted.

3834
04:12:32,989 --> 04:12:38,200
There's a lot of mobs that you kill in hard mode that drop really good things.

3835
04:12:38,200 --> 04:12:39,879
So you're like not wasting time.

3836
04:12:39,879 --> 04:12:40,120
Yeah.

3837
04:12:41,549 --> 04:12:44,110
I mean, I've picked up at least a handful of really cool looking things.

3838
04:12:45,309 --> 04:12:46,750
Have you gotten any essences?

3839
04:12:48,590 --> 04:12:50,750
I have gotten like a, I've gotten a dragon essence.

3840
04:12:51,389 --> 04:12:51,950
No, I'm sorry.

3841
04:12:51,950 --> 04:12:52,750
Dragon scale.

3842
04:12:53,559 --> 04:12:53,959
Okay.

3843
04:12:53,959 --> 04:12:55,000
Yeah, that's useful for something.

3844
04:12:55,000 --> 04:13:00,959
But if you find like sunlight essence, I think elum essence might be the cold one.

3845
04:13:01,760 --> 04:13:02,639
I need those.

3846
04:13:02,639 --> 04:13:13,040
Okay.

3847
04:13:13,040 --> 04:13:17,739
Oh, also very important for the progression of Terraria.

3848
04:13:17,739 --> 04:13:19,420
If you'd understand what's going on right now.

3849
04:13:19,420 --> 04:13:19,659
Sure.

3850
04:13:21,559 --> 04:13:25,319
When you get into hard mode, the first thing you should do, one of the first things,

3851
04:13:25,959 --> 04:13:28,059
it's actually it's going to be annoying.

3852
04:13:29,979 --> 04:13:31,340
You get the poon hammer.

3853
04:13:31,340 --> 04:13:35,260
It's literally called poon hammer from the wall of flesh.

3854
04:13:35,260 --> 04:13:39,180
It's guaranteed drop and the demon alters that are in the corruption zone.

3855
04:13:39,180 --> 04:13:42,700
You smash them with the poon hammer and then it adds new resources to the world

3856
04:13:46,940 --> 04:13:47,979
because he pooned them.

3857
04:13:48,620 --> 04:13:49,100
Of course.

3858
04:13:51,639 --> 04:13:52,360
Okay.

3859
04:13:52,360 --> 04:13:56,969
I just want to make sure we're on the same page with like the poon hammer.

3860
04:13:57,930 --> 04:13:58,090
Yeah.

3861
04:14:01,950 --> 04:14:03,389
I don't know who that was.

3862
04:14:04,190 --> 04:14:05,149
That could have been anybody.

3863
04:14:08,590 --> 04:14:08,829
Yep.

3864
04:14:10,170 --> 04:14:10,569
Snow.

3865
04:14:10,569 --> 04:14:11,530
Come on, anymore snow.

3866
04:14:12,329 --> 04:14:14,250
Maybe like find a cave or something.

3867
04:14:15,360 --> 04:14:19,360
Also, if you see lead, surprisingly, we still need it.

3868
04:14:20,319 --> 04:14:22,399
Actually, there's usually a planet that has it.

3869
04:14:22,399 --> 04:14:23,760
If you find a gravity potion.

3870
04:14:24,399 --> 04:14:25,360
Actually, I can buy one.

3871
04:14:26,159 --> 04:14:27,440
I'm on operation lead.

3872
04:14:28,239 --> 04:14:33,420
I'm going to take a brief detour from all the important freaking work I'm doing.

3873
04:14:33,420 --> 04:14:34,620
Get some lead.

3874
04:14:34,620 --> 04:14:35,420
What's the sunbat?

3875
04:14:38,190 --> 04:14:39,549
Sin bed sunbat.

3876
04:14:40,590 --> 04:14:41,790
Why is the sunbat down here?

3877
04:14:48,459 --> 04:14:49,100
Good question.

3878
04:14:50,729 --> 04:14:52,569
Is that like, is he got, is he worth something?

3879
04:14:53,370 --> 04:15:01,799
That is really good.

3880
04:15:03,870 --> 04:15:05,389
Oh, angry dog.

3881
04:15:05,389 --> 04:15:05,629
What?

3882
04:15:06,430 --> 04:15:10,959
Fight the angry dog.

3883
04:15:11,680 --> 04:15:15,149
Did he drop anything?

3884
04:15:15,709 --> 04:15:17,659
Cursed flame.

3885
04:15:17,659 --> 04:15:25,579
Well, there's a spot to go down here.

3886
04:15:26,299 --> 04:15:40,600
Still in the ice biome.

3887
04:15:40,600 --> 04:15:41,479
That's good.

3888
04:15:41,479 --> 04:15:45,469
What are they still shooting at?

3889
04:15:45,469 --> 04:15:46,590
All right, you guys can stop now.

3890
04:15:48,030 --> 04:15:49,840
Oh, wait, the sunbat.

3891
04:15:51,120 --> 04:15:52,159
But he could sneak up on me.

3892
04:15:52,879 --> 04:15:56,440
That's not going to be good here.

3893
04:15:56,440 --> 04:15:56,920
What's this?

3894
04:15:58,440 --> 04:16:00,040
Essence of something.

3895
04:16:00,840 --> 04:16:11,950
There's a big cave down here.

3896
04:16:11,950 --> 04:16:17,530
This should be good.

3897
04:16:17,530 --> 04:16:18,010
Pick it up.

3898
04:16:18,010 --> 04:16:18,729
I didn't pick it up.

3899
04:16:19,290 --> 04:16:24,219
I thought I, no, I thought I did pick it up.

3900
04:16:24,219 --> 04:16:25,020
This, there was two then.

3901
04:16:26,000 --> 04:16:26,959
Essence of sunlight.

3902
04:16:26,959 --> 04:16:32,379
And did I, I didn't pick it up that first time when it popped up on the screen.

3903
04:16:35,069 --> 04:16:35,549
Thank God.

3904
04:16:35,549 --> 04:16:38,590
You guys just said that because I, I thought I had, I thought it went in me.

3905
04:16:38,590 --> 04:16:45,639
All right, let's keep going.

3906
04:16:49,979 --> 04:16:50,540
Amethyst.

3907
04:16:51,260 --> 04:16:53,020
I'm running out of torches though.

3908
04:16:53,020 --> 04:16:53,579
Not good.

3909
04:16:54,620 --> 04:17:13,309
No, when it popped up on the screen, I, I saw, I mean, I would,

3910
04:17:13,309 --> 04:17:14,670
I said the name of the thing.

3911
04:17:14,670 --> 04:17:16,510
I said essence of, and then I kept going.

3912
04:17:16,510 --> 04:17:19,420
I thought I just picked it up.

3913
04:17:19,420 --> 04:17:19,739
Okay.

3914
04:17:19,739 --> 04:17:21,479
I want people to make it fun of me.

3915
04:17:21,479 --> 04:17:22,600
That's fine.

3916
04:17:22,600 --> 04:17:36,799
It's down here.

3917
04:17:36,799 --> 04:17:37,200
Anything.

3918
04:17:38,879 --> 04:17:39,920
The generation potion.

3919
04:17:39,920 --> 04:17:40,159
Sick.

3920
04:17:46,329 --> 04:17:48,040
Give me that staff.

3921
04:17:48,040 --> 04:17:48,520
I want it.

3922
04:17:49,399 --> 04:17:50,120
Let me do this.

3923
04:17:51,340 --> 04:17:52,219
Let me have my fun.

3924
04:17:53,020 --> 04:17:56,750
I have, how many ice blocks do I have?

3925
04:17:57,309 --> 04:17:58,350
Absolute shit load.

3926
04:17:58,350 --> 04:17:58,590
All right.

3927
04:17:58,590 --> 04:17:59,870
I'm going to have to like come back.

3928
04:18:03,389 --> 04:18:05,950
Kind of running out of materials and space.

3929
04:18:09,079 --> 04:18:09,639
Go up here.

3930
04:18:24,090 --> 04:18:24,649
Essence.

3931
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:28,680
Ice slimer.

3932
04:18:29,639 --> 04:18:31,450
Where am I?

3933
04:18:32,569 --> 04:18:33,209
Oh, there it is.

3934
04:18:33,209 --> 04:18:33,850
Ice clasper.

3935
04:18:34,569 --> 04:18:38,190
Did I get it?

3936
04:18:39,309 --> 04:18:40,430
Essence of Ilium.

3937
04:18:42,590 --> 04:18:43,950
Oh yeah, that's it.

3938
04:18:43,950 --> 04:18:47,600
Did I pick it up?

3939
04:18:57,709 --> 04:18:58,670
Essence of Ilium.

3940
04:18:59,309 --> 04:19:00,110
That's what I'm looking for.

3941
04:19:00,989 --> 04:19:01,489
Yep.

3942
04:19:02,350 --> 04:19:03,309
That's one of the things.

3943
04:19:03,309 --> 04:19:05,309
Somebody said it's not what I'm actually looking for though.

3944
04:19:06,030 --> 04:19:08,270
It's, it's, it's a thing that you're looking for.

3945
04:19:08,270 --> 04:19:08,989
Okay.

3946
04:19:08,989 --> 04:19:10,440
It's part of the puzzle.

3947
04:19:11,000 --> 04:19:11,879
It's part of the puzzle.

3948
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:28,409
And there's another one.

3949
04:19:29,850 --> 04:19:31,530
So those things also drop a staff.

3950
04:19:31,530 --> 04:19:32,969
And that's what I really want, right?

3951
04:19:32,969 --> 04:19:35,209
I'm just going to hang out here then if they just, if they spawn in here.

3952
04:19:36,809 --> 04:19:39,290
Dude, you can like go get a drink and just let your summons kill them.

3953
04:19:39,290 --> 04:19:39,850
They come near you.

3954
04:19:41,049 --> 04:19:42,729
And it's just AFK farm this game.

3955
04:19:47,950 --> 04:19:50,750
We don't, we don't give a shit about the heart crystals anymore, right?

3956
04:19:53,639 --> 04:19:55,180
We do for some reason.

3957
04:19:55,180 --> 04:19:55,659
We do.

3958
04:19:55,659 --> 04:19:56,379
Okay.

3959
04:19:56,379 --> 04:20:01,790
Got Jacob's here.

3960
04:20:08,600 --> 04:20:19,629
I don't want to drown.

3961
04:20:20,190 --> 04:20:22,680
That would be bad.

3962
04:20:23,959 --> 04:20:29,309
That started to be because my name is Jacob.

3963
04:20:30,590 --> 04:20:39,770
That's why I didn't die as an ancient ice chunk.

3964
04:20:40,329 --> 04:20:41,290
Ah, what's that?

3965
04:20:42,459 --> 04:20:44,459
Uh, crafting material for something.

3966
04:20:45,899 --> 04:20:47,100
This ice shouldn't break.

3967
04:20:52,700 --> 04:20:58,479
Um, summons an ice clasper to fight for you.

3968
04:21:00,559 --> 04:21:02,479
Are you kidding me?

3969
04:21:04,139 --> 04:21:04,620
This is it.

3970
04:21:05,340 --> 04:21:07,799
There it is.

3971
04:21:09,739 --> 04:21:10,299
I got it.

3972
04:21:10,940 --> 04:21:18,750
I'm excited now.

3973
04:21:18,750 --> 04:21:19,149
All right.

3974
04:21:19,149 --> 04:21:20,909
So I have like a cool, powerful thing now.

3975
04:21:22,760 --> 04:21:23,799
Oh, you just got it.

3976
04:21:23,799 --> 04:21:24,360
I just got it.

3977
04:21:25,159 --> 04:21:25,479
Wow.

3978
04:21:25,479 --> 04:21:25,879
You did it.

3979
04:21:26,680 --> 04:21:28,520
Well, yeah, now you, uh, now you win.

3980
04:21:28,520 --> 04:21:28,840
I did.

3981
04:21:28,840 --> 04:21:29,319
Now I win.

3982
04:21:29,319 --> 04:21:30,840
You know, I've been getting some upgrades.

3983
04:21:33,370 --> 04:21:34,090
I got a lot of them.

3984
04:21:34,090 --> 04:21:34,729
Branding material.

3985
04:21:34,729 --> 04:21:36,969
Making some power plays, making, making some power moves.

3986
04:21:36,969 --> 04:21:37,610
You know what I'm saying?

3987
04:21:37,610 --> 04:21:38,170
Something else over here.

3988
04:21:38,170 --> 04:21:38,569
What's this?

3989
04:21:38,569 --> 04:21:39,690
Topaz crawler?

3990
04:21:44,649 --> 04:21:45,209
Use it.

3991
04:21:45,209 --> 04:21:46,090
Not yet.

3992
04:21:46,090 --> 04:21:46,889
I don't want to use it yet.

3993
04:21:47,610 --> 04:21:50,270
All right.

3994
04:21:50,270 --> 04:21:51,629
I think that's, uh, I'm good, right?

3995
04:21:51,629 --> 04:21:53,760
I'll just get off.

3996
04:21:53,760 --> 04:21:54,879
Dude, you are so good.

3997
04:21:55,680 --> 04:21:57,600
So are you telling me I can have like seven of those?

3998
04:21:57,600 --> 04:21:58,079
Six of those?

3999
04:21:58,079 --> 04:22:01,530
I have however many you can have.

4000
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:02,329
Oh, wow.

4001
04:22:02,329 --> 04:22:04,250
I don't, I'm not keeping track of your damage.

4002
04:22:05,690 --> 04:22:07,290
Yeah, they're, they're insane.

4003
04:22:07,290 --> 04:22:11,530
It will stay good for a long time just because how actively they seek out targets.

4004
04:22:12,489 --> 04:22:15,850
10, but from 10 damage to 50.

4005
04:22:19,260 --> 04:22:22,940
That's a huge difference because really all my damage has been coming from the,

4006
04:22:23,819 --> 04:22:27,420
the sphere stuff thing that's been doing all the damage.

4007
04:22:32,360 --> 04:22:32,840
Nice.

4008
04:22:32,840 --> 04:22:35,239
Um, stay there for one second.

4009
04:22:35,239 --> 04:22:36,200
Stay here.

4010
04:22:36,200 --> 04:22:37,399
I'm going to teleport to you.

4011
04:22:37,959 --> 04:22:39,079
Actually, there's something you can help me with.

4012
04:22:39,079 --> 04:22:41,159
I have no torches, so hopefully you bring light.

4013
04:22:43,870 --> 04:22:45,309
Uh, I have 2000 torches.

4014
04:22:45,309 --> 04:22:45,950
Would you like some?

4015
04:22:47,129 --> 04:22:48,170
Yeah, it'd probably be nice.

4016
04:22:50,540 --> 04:22:51,819
There's a chilled turtle down here.

4017
04:22:55,280 --> 04:22:56,079
Uh, here.

4018
04:22:56,079 --> 04:22:56,879
I'm dropping them.

4019
04:22:57,520 --> 04:22:58,620
You ready?

4020
04:22:59,579 --> 04:23:00,299
Um, hold on.

4021
04:23:00,299 --> 04:23:01,819
There's like 500 torches right there.

4022
04:23:05,280 --> 04:23:06,719
I think they fit perfectly in this hole.

4023
04:23:06,719 --> 04:23:07,680
They did.

4024
04:23:07,680 --> 04:23:10,110
I don't think I can even pick them up.

4025
04:23:10,750 --> 04:23:12,430
I'm out of space.

4026
04:23:12,430 --> 04:23:13,309
Glow stick.

4027
04:23:13,309 --> 04:23:17,399
Um, fuck.

4028
04:23:17,399 --> 04:23:17,959
What do I have?

4029
04:23:17,959 --> 04:23:19,000
What dumb thing do I have?

4030
04:23:20,040 --> 04:23:21,239
I have some lead ore.

4031
04:23:21,799 --> 04:23:22,520
Not very many.

4032
04:23:23,079 --> 04:23:25,840
This lens.

4033
04:23:26,639 --> 04:23:28,399
Do I have dirt?

4034
04:23:28,399 --> 04:23:29,280
Oh, I do have dirt.

4035
04:23:29,280 --> 04:23:30,239
You're right.

4036
04:23:30,239 --> 04:23:31,040
Do I have dirt?

4037
04:23:33,770 --> 04:23:34,409
Snow block.

4038
04:23:34,969 --> 04:23:35,370
No.

4039
04:23:35,370 --> 04:23:35,850
All right.

4040
04:23:35,850 --> 04:23:36,809
I got to get out of here.

4041
04:23:37,370 --> 04:23:42,219
I got to get out of here.

4042
04:23:42,780 --> 04:23:45,020
Use the heart.

4043
04:23:45,020 --> 04:23:45,739
I can't.

4044
04:23:45,739 --> 04:23:47,100
You need to come up here to me.

4045
04:23:47,100 --> 04:23:48,379
You need to come up to the surface.

4046
04:23:48,379 --> 04:23:49,340
There's a boss.

4047
04:23:53,709 --> 04:23:55,069
That will probably kick our ass.

4048
04:23:56,489 --> 04:23:57,450
Be gone, evil.

4049
04:24:00,700 --> 04:24:01,500
Uh, you just killed it.

4050
04:24:03,180 --> 04:24:03,979
Uh, no.

4051
04:24:03,979 --> 04:24:05,180
It's still going to be on the surface.

4052
04:24:05,180 --> 04:24:06,139
You need to come up.

4053
04:24:06,139 --> 04:24:07,690
I'm coming up now.

4054
04:24:07,690 --> 04:24:09,690
Uh, I need to put my, uh, anything on.

4055
04:24:13,120 --> 04:24:14,000
There's going to be ghosts.

4056
04:24:14,879 --> 04:24:17,850
Uh, don't die, dude.

4057
04:24:17,850 --> 04:24:19,770
I don't even know what's going on down here.

4058
04:24:20,569 --> 04:24:21,690
I'm trying to get out.

4059
04:24:25,020 --> 04:24:40,590
Fuck.

4060
04:24:40,590 --> 04:24:42,510
Dude, don't, don't get ghosted.

4061
04:24:42,510 --> 04:24:44,590
I'm trying just to get the fuck out of the hole.

4062
04:24:44,590 --> 04:25:02,920
All right.

4063
04:25:02,920 --> 04:25:03,559
I'm on the surface.

4064
04:25:05,040 --> 04:25:06,719
Uh, is there an ice golem?

4065
04:25:06,719 --> 04:25:07,600
Is there a blizzard?

4066
04:25:07,600 --> 04:25:08,879
Like, is it storming up?

4067
04:25:10,299 --> 04:25:10,860
Uh, yes.

4068
04:25:10,860 --> 04:25:11,979
It's very blizzardy out here.

4069
04:25:12,700 --> 04:25:13,020
Okay.

4070
04:25:13,020 --> 04:25:15,500
Walk left and right and try and see if you can find the ice golem.

4071
04:25:15,500 --> 04:25:16,860
Maybe it was underground.

4072
04:25:16,860 --> 04:25:19,260
So, because I went up the one way.

4073
04:25:19,260 --> 04:25:24,000
I'm fucking confused.

4074
04:25:24,000 --> 04:25:24,239
Why?

4075
04:25:24,239 --> 04:25:25,200
Why is this not?

4076
04:25:25,200 --> 04:25:26,000
Is this a summon?

4077
04:25:27,360 --> 04:25:37,850
I got my shit.

4078
04:25:40,299 --> 04:25:40,700
All right.

4079
04:25:40,700 --> 04:25:41,180
He's here.

4080
04:25:41,180 --> 04:25:41,420
He's here.

4081
04:25:41,420 --> 04:25:42,379
Help bar showed up again.

4082
04:25:42,379 --> 04:25:42,540
Okay.

4083
04:25:42,540 --> 04:25:43,020
I'm coming up.

4084
04:25:44,059 --> 04:25:44,860
He's somewhere.

4085
04:25:45,899 --> 04:25:46,799
I don't know where exactly.

4086
04:25:46,799 --> 04:25:48,079
Be careful because he's going to hurt.

4087
04:25:49,389 --> 04:25:50,670
I don't know if we're ready for him.

4088
04:25:52,750 --> 04:25:53,790
Oh, he's on me.

4089
04:25:53,790 --> 04:25:54,190
On me.

4090
04:25:54,190 --> 04:25:54,989
He's down this hole.

4091
04:25:56,670 --> 04:25:57,790
Your things are attacking him.

4092
04:25:58,510 --> 04:25:58,750
Good.

4093
04:25:59,629 --> 04:26:07,899
He's almost dead because the summons are nuts.

4094
04:26:09,309 --> 04:26:09,790
Melt him.

4095
04:26:09,790 --> 04:26:10,670
Melt him.

4096
04:26:10,670 --> 04:26:11,870
And also he's in a hole.

4097
04:26:13,799 --> 04:26:14,920
Wait, does it corrupt her?

4098
04:26:15,639 --> 04:26:16,040
Okay.

4099
04:26:16,040 --> 04:26:16,600
Keep going up.

4100
04:26:16,600 --> 04:26:17,319
Keep climbing out of the hole.

4101
04:26:17,319 --> 04:26:17,879
Climb out of the hole.

4102
04:26:18,680 --> 04:26:19,319
Go to the surface.

4103
04:26:20,200 --> 04:26:25,340
Uh, oh, oh, go, go, go, go.

4104
04:26:26,860 --> 04:26:34,829
Where the hell is this thing?

4105
04:26:36,000 --> 04:26:38,159
Um, it was in the hole.

4106
04:26:41,290 --> 04:26:41,930
Oh, it's on me.

4107
04:26:41,930 --> 04:26:43,290
I mean, this thing jumping around.

4108
04:26:43,290 --> 04:26:44,809
It's going to, they hurt a lot, dude.

4109
04:26:45,530 --> 04:26:47,950
Well, they drop really good items.

4110
04:26:58,829 --> 04:27:00,190
Uh, it should be dead.

4111
04:27:01,129 --> 04:27:02,649
This is like pure fucking.

4112
04:27:04,969 --> 04:27:05,610
Mimics drop.

4113
04:27:05,610 --> 04:27:06,809
Wait, where did they die?

4114
04:27:07,930 --> 04:27:08,729
What the fuck?

4115
04:27:08,729 --> 04:27:09,530
The dart rifle.

4116
04:27:09,530 --> 04:27:10,809
Why is there another one?

4117
04:27:10,809 --> 04:27:11,370
Let's kill.

4118
04:27:11,370 --> 04:27:12,969
They, they just spawn in blizzards.

4119
04:27:16,489 --> 04:27:18,010
He's over here underneath this house.

4120
04:27:23,319 --> 04:27:23,879
Holy shit.

4121
04:27:23,879 --> 04:27:25,000
They are destroying him.

4122
04:27:26,510 --> 04:27:26,750
Yeah.

4123
04:27:26,750 --> 04:27:28,110
Those summons are ridiculous.

4124
04:27:28,110 --> 04:27:28,430
What?

4125
04:27:34,350 --> 04:27:35,389
Oh my God.

4126
04:27:35,950 --> 04:27:36,670
I can't pick up anything.

4127
04:27:36,670 --> 04:27:37,309
I have no room.

4128
04:27:37,309 --> 04:27:37,950
There's another one.

4129
04:27:37,950 --> 04:27:38,670
There's another mimic.

4130
04:27:42,270 --> 04:27:43,549
They just kind of wiggle towards you.

4131
04:27:43,549 --> 04:27:45,469
And then they go up in the air and try and slam on top.

4132
04:27:46,270 --> 04:27:50,909
So if you see it go up, just move a little bit to the left.

4133
04:27:50,909 --> 04:27:51,549
You should be fine.

4134
04:27:52,190 --> 04:27:53,079
I'm stuck.

4135
04:27:53,079 --> 04:27:54,120
I'm stuck next to the house.

4136
04:27:54,120 --> 04:27:54,440
Open the door.

4137
04:27:54,440 --> 04:27:55,000
Dig out the right.

4138
04:27:55,000 --> 04:27:55,639
Dig out the right.

4139
04:27:59,079 --> 04:28:00,040
It's like a horror movie.

4140
04:28:01,079 --> 04:28:02,409
Okay.

4141
04:28:02,409 --> 04:28:02,809
I made it.

4142
04:28:25,040 --> 04:28:26,479
I can't tell what's happening.

4143
04:28:26,479 --> 04:28:27,520
I don't even know where we are.

4144
04:28:28,159 --> 04:28:29,520
He's on you.

4145
04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:30,000
He's on you.

4146
04:28:30,239 --> 04:28:30,799
Oh, it hurts.

4147
04:28:32,940 --> 04:28:37,739
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4148
04:28:37,739 --> 04:28:38,780
No, no.

4149
04:28:38,780 --> 04:28:39,100
Hide.

4150
04:28:39,819 --> 04:28:40,139
Hide.

4151
04:28:40,139 --> 04:28:40,700
I'm hiding.

4152
04:28:43,159 --> 04:28:43,959
Keep away from me.

4153
04:28:44,600 --> 04:28:46,840
I'm dead.

4154
04:28:46,840 --> 04:28:50,680
No, it's all right.

4155
04:28:51,739 --> 04:28:52,059
Kill it.

4156
04:28:52,059 --> 04:28:53,180
Are you gonna buy a wormhole?

4157
04:28:57,149 --> 04:28:57,389
All right.

4158
04:28:57,389 --> 04:28:58,590
I think I have one already.

4159
04:28:58,590 --> 04:29:02,600
Is there another one spawning?

4160
04:29:02,600 --> 04:29:03,159
I killed him.

4161
04:29:03,719 --> 04:29:08,829
Dude, I got to like just I got a ton of shit.

4162
04:29:08,829 --> 04:29:10,110
I just gotta deposit and come back.

4163
04:29:13,850 --> 04:29:14,489
All right.

4164
04:29:14,489 --> 04:29:15,690
Is it done or is there more?

4165
04:29:15,690 --> 04:29:17,129
It's, it's, it's dead.

4166
04:29:17,129 --> 04:29:17,370
Okay.

4167
04:29:18,010 --> 04:29:23,020
I still need to destroy some altars with the poon hammer.

4168
04:29:23,020 --> 04:29:24,020
Alright, I...

4169
04:29:24,020 --> 04:29:27,020
And would appreciate all of your summons nearby.

4170
04:29:27,020 --> 04:29:29,020
Let me make this staff.

4171
04:29:29,020 --> 04:29:30,639
Right?

4172
04:29:30,639 --> 04:29:31,639
Okay.

4173
04:29:31,639 --> 04:29:32,639
Wait, this what?

4174
04:29:32,639 --> 04:29:33,639
What are you making?

4175
04:29:33,639 --> 04:29:35,639
Can I make something?

4176
04:29:35,639 --> 04:29:38,930
Can you?

4177
04:29:38,930 --> 04:29:44,319
Yeah, I thought I got two different materials for something.

4178
04:29:44,319 --> 04:29:47,840
I don't know what you got.

4179
04:29:47,840 --> 04:29:52,200
Wasn't I looking for the essence?

4180
04:29:52,200 --> 04:29:57,610
That can't make anything yet.

4181
04:29:57,610 --> 04:29:58,610
No, okay.

4182
04:29:58,610 --> 04:30:00,610
Where's the dude?

4183
04:30:00,610 --> 04:30:02,610
They just make a lot of things.

4184
04:30:02,610 --> 04:30:04,610
And you need multiple.

4185
04:30:04,610 --> 04:30:06,610
Where's the...

4186
04:30:06,610 --> 04:30:08,610
The guide might be dead still.

4187
04:30:08,610 --> 04:30:11,750
I think he's dead.

4188
04:30:11,750 --> 04:30:13,750
Oh no, he came back. He's all the way on the left.

4189
04:30:13,750 --> 04:30:16,120
He's the second on the left.

4190
04:30:16,120 --> 04:30:23,860
Oh, I got something for you.

4191
04:30:23,860 --> 04:30:25,860
I don't know what this is.

4192
04:30:25,860 --> 04:30:28,860
Cosmic Immaterializer.

4193
04:30:28,860 --> 04:30:31,479
Oh, this is a different summon.

4194
04:30:31,479 --> 04:30:34,879
Sun Gods, this is like...

4195
04:30:34,879 --> 04:30:36,879
This takes...

4196
04:30:36,879 --> 04:30:41,360
There's nothing I can do with that right now.

4197
04:30:41,360 --> 04:30:42,360
What?

4198
04:30:42,360 --> 04:30:46,360
Summons a Cosmic Energy Spiral to fight for you.

4199
04:30:46,360 --> 04:30:50,559
Does 4,439 damage.

4200
04:30:50,559 --> 04:30:53,950
Wait, what?

4201
04:30:53,950 --> 04:30:57,950
The thing that I can turn this staff into does 40, like 500 damage.

4202
04:30:57,950 --> 04:31:02,440
Oh, yeah, that would take a long time to do that, though.

4203
04:31:02,440 --> 04:31:04,440
What about the essence?

4204
04:31:04,440 --> 04:31:07,770
Let me see what that...

4205
04:31:07,770 --> 04:31:08,770
What can I do with that?

4206
04:31:08,770 --> 04:31:26,500
Did you pick up all the stuff that was there?

4207
04:31:26,500 --> 04:31:28,500
I'm still getting it.

4208
04:31:28,500 --> 04:31:30,500
Oh, dude, this sword is awesome.

4209
04:31:30,500 --> 04:31:32,190
I'm so hyped.

4210
04:31:32,190 --> 04:31:33,190
Starlight Wings?

4211
04:31:33,190 --> 04:31:35,190
Dude, everyone, get hype and chat.

4212
04:31:35,190 --> 04:31:42,229
Reduces damage.

4213
04:31:42,229 --> 04:31:44,659
Wings of the Nightingale.

4214
04:31:44,659 --> 04:31:46,959
Horizontal Speed.

4215
04:31:46,959 --> 04:31:49,329
7.5.

4216
04:31:49,329 --> 04:31:51,329
Acceleration Multiplier.

4217
04:31:51,329 --> 04:31:53,700
Average Vertical Speed.

4218
04:31:53,700 --> 04:31:55,700
These are stats I have not seen before.

4219
04:31:55,700 --> 04:31:59,159
Blood Orange?

4220
04:31:59,159 --> 04:32:01,159
Permanently increases maximum life by 25.

4221
04:32:06,239 --> 04:32:08,239
Prismaline?

4222
04:32:08,239 --> 04:32:14,920
It's like a knife core of Ilium.

4223
04:32:14,920 --> 04:32:18,190
Cryo Key.

4224
04:32:18,190 --> 04:32:21,200
Summons Cryogen.

4225
04:32:21,200 --> 04:32:23,200
Dimensional Soul Artifact.

4226
04:32:23,200 --> 04:32:28,569
Boosts all damage by 25%, but at what cost?

4227
04:32:28,569 --> 04:32:30,569
Ooh, this is what we get. Cool.

4228
04:32:30,569 --> 04:32:33,450
Arc of the Ancients.

4229
04:32:33,450 --> 04:32:38,629
That's the super sword that I can pretty much make.

4230
04:32:38,629 --> 04:32:40,629
Yeah, you kind of can, can't you?

4231
04:32:40,629 --> 04:32:41,629
Yeah.

4232
04:32:41,629 --> 04:32:43,629
It's ridiculous.

4233
04:32:43,629 --> 04:32:45,629
It does melee damage,

4234
04:32:45,629 --> 04:32:47,629
but it makes stars shoot from the sky

4235
04:32:47,629 --> 04:32:48,629
and missiles shoot from your weapon

4236
04:32:48,629 --> 04:32:50,629
and just clutters the screen with nonsense.

4237
04:32:50,629 --> 04:32:51,629
But it's melee.

4238
04:32:51,629 --> 04:32:54,250
What about the Archilis stuff?

4239
04:32:54,250 --> 04:32:55,250
How do you do that?

4240
04:32:55,250 --> 04:32:56,250
I mean, the Archilis sword,

4241
04:32:56,250 --> 04:32:57,250
the thing that you would like,

4242
04:32:57,250 --> 04:33:01,540
oh, hold on to that.

4243
04:33:01,540 --> 04:33:03,540
Isn't that one of the components?

4244
04:33:03,540 --> 04:33:04,540
What are you talking about?

4245
04:33:04,540 --> 04:33:05,540
Is that one of the components for this?

4246
04:33:05,540 --> 04:33:08,040
Yeah, yeah.

4247
04:33:08,040 --> 04:33:10,040
To make Arch of the Ancients.

4248
04:33:10,040 --> 04:33:12,040
Excalibur is really easy to get you.

4249
04:33:12,040 --> 04:33:14,040
And then we have the other sword.

4250
04:33:14,040 --> 04:33:16,599
We would just need the essences, which we have.

4251
04:33:16,599 --> 04:33:19,599
We have three Elum and three Chaos already.

4252
04:33:22,860 --> 04:33:24,360
This one.

4253
04:33:24,360 --> 04:33:27,360
Slow moving ball of flash freezing magma.

4254
04:33:27,360 --> 04:33:33,819
Nano round.

4255
04:33:33,819 --> 04:33:34,819
The butcher.

4256
04:33:34,819 --> 04:33:38,619
All right.

4257
04:33:38,619 --> 04:33:43,159
Well, let me just deposit this shit

4258
04:33:43,159 --> 04:33:46,580
because I'm not going to be,

4259
04:33:46,580 --> 04:33:48,580
you're going to be using that, not me.

4260
04:33:48,580 --> 04:33:55,770
Silver ore.

4261
04:33:55,770 --> 04:33:57,770
Even stone block.

4262
04:33:57,770 --> 04:34:01,040
This is still working really well.

4263
04:34:01,040 --> 04:34:03,040
I don't think I'm going to have this on the bar anymore.

4264
04:34:03,040 --> 04:34:07,450
I don't, yeah, I don't think I'm going to be,

4265
04:34:07,450 --> 04:34:10,450
let me see what that can turn into though.

4266
04:34:10,450 --> 04:34:15,959
What can I turn this into?

4267
04:34:15,959 --> 04:34:18,580
Can I turn it into anything?

4268
04:34:18,580 --> 04:34:19,580
No.

4269
04:34:19,580 --> 04:34:22,330
I think it's time to sell this.

4270
04:34:24,330 --> 04:34:27,680
Yeah.

4271
04:34:27,680 --> 04:34:31,520
How long were you out there looking for the ice clasp?

4272
04:34:31,520 --> 04:34:35,520
Like in that mess of bullshit we fought, I got one.

4273
04:34:35,520 --> 04:34:36,520
Not that long.

4274
04:34:36,520 --> 04:34:41,090
This thing's cool, but it's time to sell it.

4275
04:34:41,090 --> 04:34:42,090
It's going away.

4276
04:34:42,090 --> 04:34:44,549
Say goodbye.

4277
04:34:44,549 --> 04:34:53,319
This is just too good.

4278
04:34:53,319 --> 04:34:54,319
This is just too good.

4279
04:34:54,319 --> 04:34:56,200
All right.

4280
04:34:56,200 --> 04:34:58,200
Now those, I can make the boots, right?

4281
04:35:01,119 --> 04:35:02,119
Ice skates.

4282
04:35:02,119 --> 04:35:03,119
Ice skates.

4283
04:35:03,119 --> 04:35:04,360
What does it take?

4284
04:35:04,360 --> 04:35:06,360
You need leather.

4285
04:35:06,360 --> 04:35:07,360
I think there's some in there.

4286
04:35:07,360 --> 04:35:08,360
There's seven leathers.

4287
04:35:08,360 --> 04:35:10,360
Show the crafting guy the leather

4288
04:35:10,360 --> 04:35:11,360
and the boots will be on there.

4289
04:35:11,360 --> 04:35:13,360
And then see what else you need.

4290
04:35:13,360 --> 04:35:14,360
I don't think there's enough leather

4291
04:35:14,360 --> 04:35:16,360
and I don't even know what drops that.

4292
04:35:16,360 --> 04:35:18,360
You just kind of get it.

4293
04:35:18,360 --> 04:35:21,330
Okay.

4294
04:35:21,330 --> 04:35:23,330
I'm looking for the ice skates.

4295
04:35:23,330 --> 04:35:25,639
Ice skates require 20 ice blocks,

4296
04:35:25,639 --> 04:35:28,639
five leather and five, any iron bar.

4297
04:35:28,639 --> 04:35:33,310
Any iron bar.

4298
04:35:33,310 --> 04:35:37,279
We don't have iron bars, do we?

4299
04:35:37,279 --> 04:35:40,090
Lead is the same thing.

4300
04:35:40,090 --> 04:35:41,090
It is.

4301
04:35:41,090 --> 04:35:43,090
Do we have any lead bars?

4302
04:35:43,090 --> 04:35:44,090
A few.

4303
04:35:44,090 --> 04:35:46,090
We need five.

4304
04:35:46,090 --> 04:35:50,509
What's the best place to find any iron bar?

4305
04:35:50,509 --> 04:35:51,509
Iron or lead?

4306
04:35:51,509 --> 04:35:53,509
What's the best place to find it?

4307
04:35:53,509 --> 04:35:54,880
Underground.

4308
04:35:54,880 --> 04:35:55,880
Not too deep.

4309
04:35:55,880 --> 04:35:56,880
Just somewhere.

4310
04:35:56,880 --> 04:35:57,880
There's honestly going to be a lot of it.

4311
04:35:57,880 --> 04:35:59,880
We just kind of ignored it.

4312
04:35:59,880 --> 04:36:25,090
Desert fossil?

4313
04:36:25,090 --> 04:36:29,060
We need desert fossil for anything?

4314
04:36:29,060 --> 04:36:34,080
Hold on.

4315
04:36:34,080 --> 04:36:35,080
First of all.

4316
04:36:35,080 --> 04:36:43,290
Okay.

4317
04:36:43,290 --> 04:36:46,259
Unholy arrow.

4318
04:36:46,259 --> 04:36:48,259
I'm just looking for iron.

4319
04:36:48,259 --> 04:36:57,349
Oh, you gave me 5,000 torches

4320
04:36:57,349 --> 04:36:59,349
and I put them all in the trash.

4321
04:36:59,349 --> 04:37:03,290
And by trash I mean the deposit.

4322
04:37:03,290 --> 04:37:09,369
What the hell is making that noise?

4323
04:37:09,369 --> 04:37:14,430
Is that lead right here?

4324
04:37:14,430 --> 04:37:17,369
Hardened sandstone.

4325
04:37:17,369 --> 04:37:18,369
There we go.

4326
04:37:18,369 --> 04:37:23,000
Lead.

4327
04:37:23,000 --> 04:37:52,599
Tin.

4328
04:37:52,599 --> 04:37:54,599
This tin doesn't count as iron, right?

4329
04:37:54,599 --> 04:37:59,200
I don't think so.

4330
04:37:59,200 --> 04:38:13,029
Lead right here?

4331
04:38:13,029 --> 04:38:21,240
I think I have enough.

4332
04:38:21,240 --> 04:38:24,020
Lead.

4333
04:38:24,020 --> 04:38:26,020
How much lead ore makes a bar too?

4334
04:38:26,020 --> 04:38:30,970
Something like that.

4335
04:38:30,970 --> 04:38:39,700
Three.

4336
04:38:39,700 --> 04:38:40,700
Okay.

4337
04:38:40,700 --> 04:38:53,049
I should have enough after this.

4338
04:38:53,049 --> 04:38:55,740
Some more right here.

4339
04:38:55,740 --> 04:38:56,740
Hey, hey Jemba.

4340
04:38:56,740 --> 04:38:59,560
Hey, what's up?

4341
04:38:59,560 --> 04:39:02,560
I got a blazing heart for you.

4342
04:39:02,560 --> 04:39:03,560
Ooh.

4343
04:39:03,560 --> 04:39:06,560
That's not, that's not like emotional.

4344
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:09,560
That's like I actually have it.

4345
04:39:09,560 --> 04:39:11,560
Do you now?

4346
04:39:11,560 --> 04:39:14,630
Well, I appreciate it.

4347
04:39:14,630 --> 04:39:16,630
Three, six, nine, 12, 15.

4348
04:39:16,630 --> 04:39:17,630
I need five.

4349
04:39:17,630 --> 04:39:20,630
It's just lead ore in the box, right?

4350
04:39:20,630 --> 04:39:22,930
Like three or four.

4351
04:39:22,930 --> 04:39:23,930
I need five, right?

4352
04:39:23,930 --> 04:39:25,930
I think I just put some in actually.

4353
04:39:25,930 --> 04:39:35,810
Yeah.

4354
04:39:35,810 --> 04:39:37,810
Here is the blazing heart.

4355
04:39:37,810 --> 04:39:40,049
Woohoo.

4356
04:39:40,049 --> 04:39:43,049
You can also craft blazing hearts to get your health to 400,

4357
04:39:43,049 --> 04:39:44,049
but you need hellstone.

4358
04:39:44,049 --> 04:39:47,049
So if you like spend the time to do it.

4359
04:39:47,049 --> 04:39:49,380
All right.

4360
04:39:49,380 --> 04:39:52,810
I'm going to make those boots.

4361
04:39:52,810 --> 04:39:58,930
Lead bar.

4362
04:39:58,930 --> 04:40:02,450
I'm going to go try and kill a harpy.

4363
04:40:02,450 --> 04:40:03,450
I think.

4364
04:40:03,450 --> 04:40:05,450
Do you say that there was lead ore in here?

4365
04:40:05,450 --> 04:40:06,950
I think so.

4366
04:40:06,950 --> 04:40:12,130
Yes, there is.

4367
04:40:12,130 --> 04:40:15,130
Oh wait, I was crafting the freaking dummy thing.

4368
04:40:15,130 --> 04:40:16,130
Okay.

4369
04:40:16,130 --> 04:40:20,840
So easy to forget what you're doing in Terraria.

4370
04:40:20,840 --> 04:40:21,840
Yeah, it is.

4371
04:40:21,840 --> 04:40:27,659
Especially at a point in a game like this where you're instantly thrown this many new items.

4372
04:40:27,659 --> 04:40:29,659
Yeah, it's really overwhelming, but it's a lot of fun.

4373
04:40:29,659 --> 04:40:30,659
All right.

4374
04:40:30,659 --> 04:40:32,659
So I have everything I need.

4375
04:40:32,659 --> 04:40:34,540
Ice skates.

4376
04:40:34,540 --> 04:40:41,860
Pass them?

4377
04:40:41,860 --> 04:40:51,009
Oh, I have to do it over here.

4378
04:40:51,009 --> 04:40:54,040
Where's the loom?

4379
04:40:54,040 --> 04:41:00,639
Where's the loom?

4380
04:41:00,639 --> 04:41:04,319
Oh, it has to be in the inventory.

4381
04:41:04,319 --> 04:41:08,509
Yeah.

4382
04:41:08,509 --> 04:41:18,770
What am I missing in my inventory?

4383
04:41:18,770 --> 04:41:25,810
Ice, lead, leather, and then like what am I missing?

4384
04:41:25,810 --> 04:41:36,040
What the fuck am I missing?

4385
04:41:36,040 --> 04:41:44,189
What are you trying to do?

4386
04:41:44,189 --> 04:41:46,189
You might be at the wrong crafting station.

4387
04:41:46,189 --> 04:41:47,189
Ice skates?

4388
04:41:47,189 --> 04:41:48,189
Ice skates.

4389
04:41:48,189 --> 04:41:51,000
You have to stand near this thing over here.

4390
04:41:51,000 --> 04:41:54,700
The ice creator.

4391
04:41:54,700 --> 04:41:56,700
Oh, there's an ice creator.

4392
04:41:56,700 --> 04:41:57,700
Okay.

4393
04:41:57,700 --> 04:41:58,700
Yeah.

4394
04:41:58,700 --> 04:41:59,700
I got annoyed at the same thing.

4395
04:41:59,700 --> 04:42:00,700
All right.

4396
04:42:00,700 --> 04:42:05,700
So I got the ice skates and now I'm going to make the super duper super boots.

4397
04:42:05,700 --> 04:42:10,080
Okay, chat.

4398
04:42:10,080 --> 04:42:17,950
Like what the fuck was I doing with the purified shards?

4399
04:42:17,950 --> 04:42:22,659
Do I have to go to a different table for this one too?

4400
04:42:22,659 --> 04:42:24,959
Is there another table?

4401
04:42:24,959 --> 04:42:25,959
I have to take the boots off.

4402
04:42:25,959 --> 04:42:26,959
Okay.

4403
04:42:26,959 --> 04:42:43,159
Am I losing my mind right now?

4404
04:42:43,159 --> 04:42:49,790
Or the tinker table?

4405
04:42:49,790 --> 04:42:57,119
Which one of these is the tinker table?

4406
04:42:57,119 --> 04:43:02,759
Tinker table on the left.

4407
04:43:02,759 --> 04:43:10,119
Far right.

4408
04:43:10,119 --> 04:43:12,119
Tinker table on the left.

4409
04:43:12,119 --> 04:43:13,119
On the far right.

4410
04:43:13,119 --> 04:43:17,720
Okay, there it is.

4411
04:43:17,720 --> 04:43:27,159
Oh, I keep muting.

4412
04:43:27,159 --> 04:43:29,159
Here, try this accessory.

4413
04:43:29,159 --> 04:43:31,159
I don't know if you're going to actually use it.

4414
04:43:31,159 --> 04:43:32,840
But here.

4415
04:43:32,840 --> 04:43:38,750
I'm just going to look at the louse flight super fast running extra mobility on ice.

4416
04:43:38,750 --> 04:43:39,750
Seven percent degrees movement speed.

4417
04:43:39,750 --> 04:43:43,270
So this is just, we just keep going.

4418
04:43:43,270 --> 04:43:46,919
So it's super fast.

4419
04:43:46,919 --> 04:43:48,919
Faster than incredibly fast.

4420
04:43:48,919 --> 04:43:51,919
One can only assume.

4421
04:43:51,919 --> 04:43:54,919
I mean, they'll sound pretty, pretty good.

4422
04:43:54,919 --> 04:43:58,150
Okay.

4423
04:43:58,150 --> 04:44:00,150
Now what can I do with this?

4424
04:44:00,150 --> 04:44:05,200
I can do more than this?

4425
04:44:05,200 --> 04:44:07,849
No, no.

4426
04:44:07,849 --> 04:44:09,849
It's just that it's not.

4427
04:44:09,849 --> 04:44:10,849
It's not.

4428
04:44:10,849 --> 04:44:11,849
You can't.

4429
04:44:11,849 --> 04:44:12,849
This is the end.

4430
04:44:12,849 --> 04:44:14,849
Oh my God.

4431
04:44:14,849 --> 04:44:19,419
Angel treads.

4432
04:44:19,419 --> 04:44:24,709
Extreme speed.

4433
04:44:24,709 --> 04:44:29,709
Water and lava walking and temporary immunity to lava.

4434
04:44:29,709 --> 04:44:34,330
Enhanced ability to walk on water, ice, fire blocks and lava allows flight as the

4435
04:44:34,330 --> 04:44:36,330
wearer can run incredibly fast.

4436
04:44:36,330 --> 04:44:40,880
These seem like better, right?

4437
04:44:40,880 --> 04:44:42,880
That's a lot of bars.

4438
04:44:42,880 --> 04:44:48,000
But whatever.

4439
04:44:48,000 --> 04:44:50,000
I mean, let's how fast is fast?

4440
04:44:50,000 --> 04:44:52,000
Super fast.

4441
04:44:52,000 --> 04:44:58,139
Let's just run.

4442
04:44:58,139 --> 04:45:05,930
I mean, that's that's pretty fast.

4443
04:45:05,930 --> 04:45:16,490
Can I fly for longer too?

4444
04:45:16,490 --> 04:45:17,490
Not really.

4445
04:45:17,490 --> 04:45:20,950
Hey, you want to want to assist me?

4446
04:45:20,950 --> 04:45:22,950
Yeah, I just was looking at the thing I just made.

4447
04:45:22,950 --> 04:45:25,380
Yeah.

4448
04:45:25,380 --> 04:45:27,709
Okay.

4449
04:45:27,709 --> 04:45:28,709
You gave me.

4450
04:45:28,709 --> 04:45:29,709
Did you check the accessory I gave you?

4451
04:45:29,709 --> 04:45:30,709
Fear monger.

4452
04:45:30,709 --> 04:45:33,650
5% reduced damage taken.

4453
04:45:33,650 --> 04:45:35,650
Enemies are less likely to target you.

4454
04:45:35,650 --> 04:45:38,919
Um, it's not that good.

4455
04:45:38,919 --> 04:45:42,950
But no, what can it turn into?

4456
04:45:42,950 --> 04:45:48,130
You combine it with some healer item I don't have to get.

4457
04:45:48,130 --> 04:45:51,130
And then it like reduces damage to the allies around you.

4458
04:45:51,130 --> 04:45:53,689
Oh, that's cool.

4459
04:45:53,689 --> 04:46:02,560
5% reduced damage taken versus 4 defense and 1% damage reduction.

4460
04:46:02,560 --> 04:46:09,299
What turns out to be more damage mitigation?

4461
04:46:09,299 --> 04:46:15,299
I'm saying 5% less damage or 1% less damage and 4 defense.

4462
04:46:15,299 --> 04:46:17,299
Anybody know?

4463
04:46:17,299 --> 04:46:18,299
5%.

4464
04:46:18,299 --> 04:46:19,299
5%.

4465
04:46:19,299 --> 04:46:20,299
I had to guess.

4466
04:46:20,299 --> 04:46:26,000
Well, we'll get it on there then.

4467
04:46:26,000 --> 04:46:27,430
No more bees.

4468
04:46:27,430 --> 04:46:29,430
What can I do with bees?

4469
04:46:29,430 --> 04:46:35,599
Honey balloon.

4470
04:46:35,599 --> 04:46:36,599
That's cool.

4471
04:46:36,599 --> 04:46:37,599
All right.

4472
04:46:37,599 --> 04:46:44,340
Assist.

4473
04:46:44,340 --> 04:46:45,340
Plague hive.

4474
04:46:45,340 --> 04:46:47,580
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.

4475
04:46:47,580 --> 04:46:49,580
This is what I was saying.

4476
04:46:49,580 --> 04:46:55,819
This is like going to the bakery and the chocolate factory at the same time.

4477
04:46:55,819 --> 04:46:59,819
And they just say, hey, by the way, Jeremy, everything is free today.

4478
04:46:59,819 --> 04:47:03,819
But you can only have 10 things.

4479
04:47:03,819 --> 04:47:06,819
You can have anything you want, but you can only pick 10.

4480
04:47:06,819 --> 04:47:10,819
It's more like you can have whatever you want.

4481
04:47:10,819 --> 04:47:15,819
You can have whatever you want, but you need to learn and understand what all the ingredients are first.

4482
04:47:15,819 --> 04:47:17,819
No.

4483
04:47:17,819 --> 04:47:29,209
As long as you can prove to us that you know the recipe, we'll give it to you for free.

4484
04:47:29,209 --> 04:47:33,209
I mean, that looks really good, but how do they possibly get all the pastry in there?

4485
04:47:33,209 --> 04:47:36,209
How do you get the chocolate sprinkles on there to stick?

4486
04:47:36,209 --> 04:47:40,209
Sorry, motherfucker.

4487
04:47:41,209 --> 04:47:43,209
I know how to make the meringue.

4488
04:47:43,209 --> 04:47:45,209
It's eggs and lemon.

4489
04:47:45,209 --> 04:47:46,209
Okay.

4490
04:47:46,209 --> 04:47:50,159
What else?

4491
04:47:50,159 --> 04:47:52,909
A wormhole to me.

4492
04:47:52,909 --> 04:47:54,909
We're about to get fucking crazy.

4493
04:47:54,909 --> 04:47:55,909
What?

4494
04:47:55,909 --> 04:47:56,909
Hold on.

4495
04:47:56,909 --> 04:47:58,849
I don't have anything.

4496
04:47:58,849 --> 04:47:59,849
Do I have?

4497
04:47:59,849 --> 04:48:00,849
Let me deposit my...

4498
04:48:00,849 --> 04:48:01,849
Hold on.

4499
04:48:01,849 --> 04:48:03,849
You need me now.

4500
04:48:03,849 --> 04:48:04,849
Wait.

4501
04:48:04,849 --> 04:48:05,849
Hold on.

4502
04:48:05,849 --> 04:48:06,849
Seriously.

4503
04:48:06,849 --> 04:48:08,849
Do you want to fight a boss or no?

4504
04:48:08,849 --> 04:48:12,279
I do, but there are too many fucking ingredients on the table.

4505
04:48:12,279 --> 04:48:14,279
I mean, you're going to have more after this boss.

4506
04:48:14,279 --> 04:48:15,279
Oh my god.

4507
04:48:15,279 --> 04:48:16,279
Okay.

4508
04:48:16,279 --> 04:48:17,279
I guess I'm coming to you.

4509
04:48:17,279 --> 04:48:20,360
Quick, before this blizzard ends.

4510
04:48:20,360 --> 04:48:22,360
I don't even know where the fuck you are.

4511
04:48:22,360 --> 04:48:24,360
Wormhole potion.

4512
04:48:24,360 --> 04:48:26,360
I'm on the map right now and I don't even see you.

4513
04:48:26,360 --> 04:48:28,360
To the right.

4514
04:48:28,360 --> 04:48:35,459
Wormhole potion.

4515
04:48:35,459 --> 04:48:37,459
I'm doing a...

4516
04:48:37,459 --> 04:48:40,279
I'm here.

4517
04:48:40,279 --> 04:48:42,279
You have all your stuff summoned?

4518
04:48:42,279 --> 04:48:43,279
I've got all my stuff.

4519
04:48:43,279 --> 04:48:47,459
Is this going to be hard?

4520
04:48:47,459 --> 04:48:49,759
I don't know.

4521
04:48:49,759 --> 04:48:52,259
Dude, I don't know.

4522
04:48:53,259 --> 04:49:03,759
Honestly, it's hard to gauge

4523
04:49:03,759 --> 04:49:05,759
because I fought a lot of these things a little bit late

4524
04:49:05,759 --> 04:49:06,759
the last time I played.

4525
04:49:06,759 --> 04:49:08,759
So I was already too strong.

4526
04:49:08,759 --> 04:49:10,759
But also you have seven ice claspers

4527
04:49:10,759 --> 04:49:11,759
or whatever you have.

4528
04:49:11,759 --> 04:49:15,680
Also, I have one.

4529
04:49:15,680 --> 04:49:17,680
So it's just...

4530
04:49:17,680 --> 04:49:19,950
It's just...

4531
04:49:19,950 --> 04:49:21,950
It's murder, dude.

4532
04:49:21,950 --> 04:49:29,630
We're going to do another one.

4533
04:49:29,630 --> 04:49:32,119
I might have done two.

4534
04:49:32,119 --> 04:49:34,119
I don't know if the second one's full.

4535
04:49:34,119 --> 04:49:42,209
Oh no.

4536
04:49:42,209 --> 04:49:44,209
I tried the strategy and it didn't work

4537
04:49:44,209 --> 04:49:45,209
because I'm stupid.

4538
04:49:45,209 --> 04:49:55,959
I'm fucking dying like a dumbass.

4539
04:49:55,959 --> 04:49:56,959
Drops a lot of health.

4540
04:49:56,959 --> 04:49:57,959
Go pick it up.

4541
04:49:57,959 --> 04:50:08,799
Go pick them up.

4542
04:50:08,799 --> 04:50:09,799
I'm going to be real with you.

4543
04:50:09,799 --> 04:50:13,799
I just can't even tell if there's anything on the screen.

4544
04:50:13,799 --> 04:50:14,799
Everything is so...

4545
04:50:14,799 --> 04:50:15,799
It's so dark.

4546
04:50:15,799 --> 04:50:16,799
The blizzard is rough.

4547
04:50:16,799 --> 04:50:17,799
You're dying, man.

4548
04:50:17,799 --> 04:50:18,799
Do you have healing potions?

4549
04:50:18,799 --> 04:50:20,799
Yeah, I'm good.

4550
04:50:20,799 --> 04:50:29,099
The thing that mine dropped was pretty shitty.

4551
04:50:29,099 --> 04:50:31,919
I don't know what you got.

4552
04:50:31,919 --> 04:50:33,090
Ice golem.

4553
04:50:33,090 --> 04:50:35,090
Another ice golem.

4554
04:50:35,090 --> 04:50:45,159
Also, actually, for a summon boy,

4555
04:50:45,159 --> 04:50:46,159
if you go up in the sky,

4556
04:50:46,159 --> 04:50:48,159
you can fight the wind elemental

4557
04:50:48,159 --> 04:50:49,159
and then you get an accessory item

4558
04:50:49,159 --> 04:50:51,849
that just like...

4559
04:50:51,849 --> 04:50:52,849
Really?

4560
04:50:52,849 --> 04:50:54,849
Where you constantly have a wind elemental

4561
04:50:54,849 --> 04:50:56,849
that follows you.

4562
04:50:56,849 --> 04:50:58,279
What did he drop?

4563
04:50:58,279 --> 04:50:59,970
Anything good?

4564
04:50:59,970 --> 04:51:01,970
I think he dropped a lot of it down the hole

4565
04:51:01,970 --> 04:51:03,970
and not really.

4566
04:51:03,970 --> 04:51:09,049
Blizzard.

4567
04:51:09,049 --> 04:51:16,049
We're still kind of hanging out

4568
04:51:16,049 --> 04:51:18,049
waiting for another one to spawn.

4569
04:51:18,049 --> 04:51:30,040
He dropped an essence.

4570
04:51:30,040 --> 04:51:32,479
He dropped a frost...

4571
04:51:32,479 --> 04:51:33,479
Barner?

4572
04:51:33,479 --> 04:51:34,479
Frost Barney?

4573
04:51:34,479 --> 04:51:38,959
Frost Barrier.

4574
04:51:38,959 --> 04:51:41,880
Ooh, nice.

4575
04:51:41,880 --> 04:51:42,880
Lucky shackle.

4576
04:51:42,880 --> 04:51:43,880
Oh, God.

4577
04:51:43,880 --> 04:51:44,880
I don't even know what my summons are.

4578
04:51:44,880 --> 04:51:56,529
They're just running around aimlessly.

4579
04:51:56,529 --> 04:52:08,689
I'm trying to summon another boss

4580
04:52:08,689 --> 04:52:10,689
and it's not happening.

4581
04:52:10,689 --> 04:52:14,040
Amarok?

4582
04:52:14,040 --> 04:52:20,080
Let me go.

4583
04:52:20,080 --> 04:52:21,080
Here he is.

4584
04:52:21,080 --> 04:52:32,369
This music is so loud.

4585
04:52:32,369 --> 04:52:33,369
Is it just me?

4586
04:52:33,369 --> 04:52:37,369
It's just like louder music than every other boss.

4587
04:52:37,369 --> 04:52:40,369
My music's turned down.

4588
04:52:40,369 --> 04:52:41,369
What's that?

4589
04:52:41,369 --> 04:52:48,009
Dangerous glacier.

4590
04:52:48,009 --> 04:52:50,569
It's not very good.

4591
04:52:50,569 --> 04:52:54,520
Yeah, I don't know what this boss's drop pool is,

4592
04:52:54,520 --> 04:52:56,520
but I'm not impressed.

4593
04:53:01,470 --> 04:53:02,470
I've got to stand still.

4594
04:53:02,470 --> 04:53:12,919
I've got to read you.

4595
04:53:12,919 --> 04:53:15,919
I want to make sure they're all still alive.

4596
04:53:15,919 --> 04:53:19,919
How many fucking torches did you put on this house?

4597
04:53:19,919 --> 04:53:21,290
What?

4598
04:53:21,290 --> 04:53:22,290
What are you talking about?

4599
04:53:22,290 --> 04:53:23,290
I don't know.

4600
04:53:23,290 --> 04:53:24,290
Nothing.

4601
04:53:24,290 --> 04:53:25,290
Where?

4602
04:53:25,290 --> 04:53:26,290
Nowhere.

4603
04:53:26,290 --> 04:53:27,290
Show me.

4604
04:53:27,290 --> 04:53:28,290
The house over to the right.

4605
04:53:28,290 --> 04:53:30,290
The random generated house.

4606
04:53:30,290 --> 04:53:34,900
I don't know.

4607
04:53:34,900 --> 04:53:36,900
There's a torch on every tile in front of it.

4608
04:53:36,900 --> 04:53:38,900
Like, no space between them.

4609
04:53:38,900 --> 04:53:43,720
I don't know.

4610
04:53:43,720 --> 04:53:47,369
Sometimes I get scared, man.

4611
04:53:47,369 --> 04:53:49,369
Pirates are approaching from the west.

4612
04:53:49,369 --> 04:53:50,369
Fuck.

4613
04:53:50,369 --> 04:53:51,369
Go back to the base.

4614
04:53:51,369 --> 04:53:54,830
Tell me when you're there, because I need to wormhole on you.

4615
04:53:54,830 --> 04:53:55,830
I'm here.

4616
04:53:55,830 --> 04:53:58,900
I'm at the base.

4617
04:53:58,900 --> 04:54:00,900
Okay, they'll be here soon.

4618
04:54:00,900 --> 04:54:02,080
They're kind of annoying.

4619
04:54:02,080 --> 04:54:03,080
There's no doors.

4620
04:54:03,080 --> 04:54:04,080
They're just like every other invasion.

4621
04:54:04,080 --> 04:54:06,080
Pirate captains kind of hurt.

4622
04:54:06,080 --> 04:54:10,080
They drop a absolute shit ton of gold.

4623
04:54:10,080 --> 04:54:11,080
Really?

4624
04:54:11,080 --> 04:54:14,080
So we want to be here to kill them.

4625
04:54:14,080 --> 04:54:20,180
It is.

4626
04:54:20,180 --> 04:54:21,180
I'm just going to have to deposit it.

4627
04:54:21,180 --> 04:54:23,180
I will have to look at it later.

4628
04:54:23,180 --> 04:54:24,180
I'm going to have to look at it later.

4629
04:54:24,180 --> 04:54:25,180
It's all in there.

4630
04:54:25,180 --> 04:54:26,180
I don't know.

4631
04:54:26,180 --> 04:54:28,740
I'll check it out later.

4632
04:54:28,740 --> 04:54:43,009
The pirates have arrived.

4633
04:54:43,009 --> 04:54:47,490
Honestly, you're probably going to auto kill a lot of them.

4634
04:54:47,490 --> 04:54:50,490
Especially if they walk this way, because I have the lava ground,

4635
04:54:50,490 --> 04:54:53,490
and they don't give a shit about lava.

4636
04:54:53,490 --> 04:54:55,490
Yeah, they really don't.

4637
04:54:55,490 --> 04:55:18,490
What about the other side?

4638
04:55:18,490 --> 04:55:22,950
If you stay on this side, then they probably won't spawn on the other side.

4639
04:55:22,950 --> 04:55:23,950
They're coming in here.

4640
04:55:23,950 --> 04:55:24,950
This door is open.

4641
04:55:24,950 --> 04:55:27,950
If we shut the door, they shouldn't be able to get in that door.

4642
04:55:28,950 --> 04:55:32,759
Nothing despawns in Terraria, right?

4643
04:55:32,759 --> 04:55:33,759
It just stays there.

4644
04:55:33,759 --> 04:55:34,759
It's like money.

4645
04:55:34,759 --> 04:55:36,759
Or should we go collect it from time to time?

4646
04:55:36,759 --> 04:55:39,069
I actually don't know.

4647
04:55:39,069 --> 04:55:42,560
I think it's a lot different between multiplayer and single player.

4648
04:55:42,560 --> 04:55:58,819
Well, I got some.

4649
04:55:58,819 --> 04:56:18,490
There are more than 4,000 items on the ground.

4650
04:56:18,490 --> 04:56:25,720
It starts to despawn.

4651
04:56:25,720 --> 04:56:27,720
Well, now there's 3,415.

4652
04:56:27,720 --> 04:56:43,470
That's a lot of stuff.

4653
04:56:43,470 --> 04:56:47,319
There's like a...

4654
04:56:47,319 --> 04:56:50,000
Oh my God, there's so much stuff.

4655
04:56:50,000 --> 04:56:53,439
You can drop like golden toilets and stuff as well.

4656
04:56:53,439 --> 04:56:58,619
You're going to want to sell that.

4657
04:56:58,619 --> 04:56:59,619
Oh, man.

4658
04:56:59,619 --> 04:57:02,619
We might have to destroy a pirate ship.

4659
04:57:02,619 --> 04:57:04,619
I'm surprised we haven't seen it yet.

4660
04:57:04,619 --> 04:57:14,919
That would be the pirate...

4661
04:57:14,919 --> 04:57:16,919
Whoa!

4662
04:57:16,919 --> 04:57:17,919
What?

4663
04:57:17,919 --> 04:57:20,919
It just crashed into the side.

4664
04:57:22,919 --> 04:57:25,099
Here we come!

4665
04:57:25,099 --> 04:57:27,099
Somebody's just like...

4666
04:57:27,099 --> 04:57:30,979
Somebody didn't know how to break.

4667
04:57:30,979 --> 04:57:37,759
Full speed ahead.

4668
04:57:37,759 --> 04:57:44,000
There it is.

4669
04:57:44,000 --> 04:57:46,000
Okay.

4670
04:57:46,000 --> 04:57:49,900
Oh, look at all that stuff.

4671
04:57:49,900 --> 04:57:50,900
Oh, no, it's not the pirate ship.

4672
04:57:50,900 --> 04:57:52,900
Boom!

4673
04:57:52,900 --> 04:57:54,590
Oh, where'd it go?

4674
04:57:54,590 --> 04:57:56,590
The flying Dutchman.

4675
04:57:56,590 --> 04:58:05,189
Here she comes.

4676
04:58:05,189 --> 04:58:12,060
Come on, fire.

4677
04:58:12,060 --> 04:58:13,060
Why isn't there fire?

4678
04:58:13,060 --> 04:58:15,580
Get in there.

4679
04:58:15,580 --> 04:58:17,580
Be brave, you pile of shit.

4680
04:58:17,580 --> 04:58:25,000
Be brave, fuckers.

4681
04:58:25,000 --> 04:58:31,470
Be brave, all horses, asses.

4682
04:58:31,470 --> 04:58:39,509
You bitches.

4683
04:58:39,509 --> 04:58:42,450
We done died today.

4684
04:58:42,450 --> 04:58:45,040
That game.

4685
04:58:45,040 --> 04:58:47,340
What a game.

4686
04:58:47,340 --> 04:58:49,340
We should probably make sure we have everything.

4687
04:58:49,340 --> 04:58:54,549
I did get a tuba.

4688
04:58:54,549 --> 04:58:55,549
You're right.

4689
04:58:55,549 --> 04:59:01,369
What does a tuba do in this game?

4690
04:59:01,369 --> 04:59:03,680
That's one gold 57...

4691
04:59:03,680 --> 04:59:04,680
Holy shit.

4692
04:59:04,680 --> 04:59:12,599
There's a whole bard class that attacks with music and buffs allies around them.

4693
04:59:12,599 --> 04:59:16,439
Well, that was insane.

4694
04:59:16,439 --> 04:59:18,939
That's a lot of stuff.

4695
04:59:18,939 --> 04:59:22,650
Did we get everything?

4696
04:59:22,650 --> 04:59:24,150
I think so.

4697
04:59:24,150 --> 04:59:26,220
I'm just checking.

4698
04:59:26,220 --> 04:59:32,520
I don't want to leave one piece of silver on the ground.

4699
04:59:32,520 --> 04:59:39,790
How come a golden toilet is two gold and a golden piano is 60 copper?

4700
04:59:39,790 --> 04:59:43,240
Let's see what we got.

4701
04:59:43,240 --> 04:59:47,110
Golden bathtub.

4702
04:59:47,110 --> 04:59:52,229
You can sell this to anybody, right?

4703
04:59:52,229 --> 04:59:55,750
Does it matter who you sell it to?

4704
04:59:55,750 --> 04:59:56,750
No, right?

4705
04:59:56,750 --> 04:59:57,750
Two gold.

4706
04:59:57,750 --> 05:00:03,959
Nearby players get a bonus against pirate corsair.

4707
05:00:03,959 --> 05:00:08,090
24-carat tuba.

4708
05:00:08,090 --> 05:00:12,380
50 symphonic damage.

4709
05:00:12,380 --> 05:00:14,380
Four crit.

4710
05:00:14,380 --> 05:00:16,380
Launches an explosive burst of sound.

4711
05:00:16,380 --> 05:00:18,380
Damage empowers players with bonus.

4712
05:00:18,380 --> 05:00:19,380
Damage reduction 11.

4713
05:00:19,380 --> 05:00:26,290
Holy shit.

4714
05:00:26,290 --> 05:00:27,290
Golden clock.

4715
05:00:27,290 --> 05:00:30,750
Guarding gold ring.

4716
05:00:30,750 --> 05:00:35,229
Increases coin pickup range.

4717
05:00:35,229 --> 05:00:39,229
Two defense and almost 0.5% damage reduction.

4718
05:00:39,229 --> 05:00:44,729
Golden door.

4719
05:00:44,729 --> 05:00:45,729
Can we have a golden door?

4720
05:00:45,729 --> 05:00:46,729
What?

4721
05:00:46,729 --> 05:00:50,020
Golden door?

4722
05:00:50,020 --> 05:00:51,020
I didn't get one.

4723
05:00:51,020 --> 05:00:52,020
I got one.

4724
05:00:52,020 --> 05:00:53,020
Do you want to put it there?

4725
05:00:53,020 --> 05:00:54,709
Do you?

4726
05:00:54,709 --> 05:00:55,709
No.

4727
05:00:55,709 --> 05:00:57,139
Okay.

4728
05:00:57,139 --> 05:00:59,139
Flying Dutchman trophy.

4729
05:00:59,139 --> 05:01:02,340
Holy shit.

4730
05:01:02,340 --> 05:01:05,279
Zealous hand cannon.

4731
05:01:05,279 --> 05:01:07,279
82 range damage.

4732
05:01:07,279 --> 05:01:09,279
Almost 10% crit chance.

4733
05:01:09,279 --> 05:01:13,569
Is that that stupid KO fist?

4734
05:01:13,569 --> 05:01:15,569
No, it's a big cannon.

4735
05:01:15,569 --> 05:01:18,450
Can I see it?

4736
05:01:18,450 --> 05:01:19,450
Where are you?

4737
05:01:19,450 --> 05:01:23,060
Oh yeah.

4738
05:01:23,060 --> 05:01:26,990
Golden charge.

4739
05:01:26,990 --> 05:01:30,000
Golden table.

4740
05:01:30,000 --> 05:01:36,330
Golden platform.

4741
05:01:36,330 --> 05:01:37,330
Garo's breath.

4742
05:01:38,330 --> 05:01:42,599
Oh, I think it uses the grenade shells or magnum rounds or whatever.

4743
05:01:42,599 --> 05:01:43,599
Okay.

4744
05:01:43,599 --> 05:01:46,220
It's a golden toilet.

4745
05:01:46,220 --> 05:01:48,779
And then a golden chair.

4746
05:01:48,779 --> 05:01:56,240
Don't shoot it in the house.

4747
05:01:56,240 --> 05:02:00,080
I mean, I wasn't planning on it.

4748
05:02:00,080 --> 05:02:05,330
Give the rounds.

4749
05:02:05,330 --> 05:02:07,330
Do you want the seating charge?

4750
05:02:07,330 --> 05:02:10,529
I have a lot of those here too.

4751
05:02:10,529 --> 05:02:11,529
Oh no.

4752
05:02:11,529 --> 05:02:13,529
Do you still use that honeycomb?

4753
05:02:13,529 --> 05:02:15,900
I have it.

4754
05:02:15,900 --> 05:02:16,900
Do you want it?

4755
05:02:16,900 --> 05:02:19,459
Yeah.

4756
05:02:19,459 --> 05:02:29,419
I'm curious if this ever makes anything good eventually.

4757
05:02:29,419 --> 05:02:30,419
I just gave it to you.

4758
05:02:30,419 --> 05:02:31,419
All right.

4759
05:02:31,419 --> 05:02:33,419
I want to just play with the tuba for a second.

4760
05:02:33,419 --> 05:02:35,659
I just want to know what it does.

4761
05:02:35,659 --> 05:02:36,840
Yeah.

4762
05:02:36,840 --> 05:02:45,599
That's what it does.

4763
05:02:45,599 --> 05:02:48,290
So it just shoots up with a little bit of grenades.

4764
05:02:48,290 --> 05:03:01,349
They don't go very far.

4765
05:03:01,349 --> 05:03:02,349
All right.

4766
05:03:02,349 --> 05:03:04,549
Well, that's cool.

4767
05:03:04,549 --> 05:03:06,549
I can turn it into anything?

4768
05:03:06,549 --> 05:03:07,549
No.

4769
05:03:07,549 --> 05:03:09,299
I'm just selling it.

4770
05:03:09,299 --> 05:03:11,299
Unless you want it for anything.

4771
05:03:11,299 --> 05:03:13,479
It's not a material or anything.

4772
05:03:13,479 --> 05:03:14,479
No.

4773
05:03:14,479 --> 05:03:16,479
I don't.

4774
05:03:29,880 --> 05:03:31,830
Stone.

4775
05:03:31,830 --> 05:03:36,900
What about this captain's foie gras?

4776
05:03:36,900 --> 05:03:40,290
Thrower class?

4777
05:03:40,290 --> 05:03:43,000
Sell them?

4778
05:03:43,000 --> 05:03:44,000
The what?

4779
05:03:44,000 --> 05:03:47,000
The captain's, like, the thrower?

4780
05:03:47,000 --> 05:03:48,000
Give it to me.

4781
05:03:48,000 --> 05:03:50,000
I'm doing throwing weapons now.

4782
05:03:50,000 --> 05:03:54,790
Damn, that's a lot.

4783
05:03:54,790 --> 05:03:55,790
That is a lot.

4784
05:03:55,790 --> 05:03:59,549
They're pretty good too.

4785
05:03:59,549 --> 05:04:01,549
Flying Dutchman trophy, I'm assuming he's not.

4786
05:04:01,549 --> 05:04:03,549
OK, this guardian gold ring, I think, is pretty rare.

4787
05:04:03,549 --> 05:04:11,970
What can you do with it?

4788
05:04:11,970 --> 05:04:12,970
Coin ring.

4789
05:04:12,970 --> 05:04:16,069
Really?

4790
05:04:16,069 --> 05:04:22,270
It increases coin pickup range, and hitting enemies will sometimes drop extra coins.

4791
05:04:22,270 --> 05:04:33,979
I mean, rare doesn't usually mean always good.

4792
05:04:33,979 --> 05:04:35,979
Well, let's put him onto it.

4793
05:04:35,979 --> 05:04:47,049
Where's Popo?

4794
05:04:47,049 --> 05:04:49,509
Hey, put this door on.

4795
05:04:49,509 --> 05:04:51,130
No, potion.

4796
05:04:51,130 --> 05:04:56,380
Put that golden door somewhere.

4797
05:04:56,380 --> 05:04:59,380
Why can't you?

4798
05:04:59,380 --> 05:05:06,759
I don't understand.

4799
05:05:06,759 --> 05:05:12,119
Where the fuck is Popo?

4800
05:05:14,119 --> 05:05:20,340
I could have just turned around and just placed it, but I don't know.

4801
05:05:20,340 --> 05:05:22,340
I don't know why it was.

4802
05:05:22,340 --> 05:05:24,340
You know, it's your server.

4803
05:05:24,340 --> 05:05:25,340
I feel like it's a golden door.

4804
05:05:25,340 --> 05:05:31,340
You get the honors to, like, put the golden door up, I think, somewhere in my brain.

4805
05:05:31,340 --> 05:05:33,340
Yeah, I deserved the honor.

4806
05:05:33,340 --> 05:05:34,340
He doesn't know how.

4807
05:05:34,340 --> 05:05:37,479
Yes, I do.

4808
05:05:37,479 --> 05:05:38,479
See?

4809
05:05:38,479 --> 05:05:40,479
OK, I know how to put a door up.

4810
05:05:40,479 --> 05:05:43,439
I needed to prove that right away.

4811
05:05:43,439 --> 05:05:45,439
Why am I on fire?

4812
05:05:45,439 --> 05:05:50,040
Am I burning?

4813
05:05:50,040 --> 05:05:56,040
I think those are your shoes that you're wearing, that you're just not used to, that you light on fire when you run.

4814
05:05:56,040 --> 05:05:58,900
What?

4815
05:05:58,900 --> 05:06:01,479
No.

4816
05:06:01,479 --> 05:06:02,479
You just look cool.

4817
05:06:02,479 --> 05:06:06,159
No, this is happening when I get home in the house.

4818
05:06:06,159 --> 05:06:07,159
Oh, that's...

4819
05:06:07,159 --> 05:06:09,159
I built...

4820
05:06:09,159 --> 05:06:10,330
Where is it?

4821
05:06:10,330 --> 05:06:13,560
Where the hell did I put it?

4822
05:06:13,560 --> 05:06:16,560
I need a staff.

4823
05:06:16,560 --> 05:06:17,560
I want a staff.

4824
05:06:17,560 --> 05:06:18,560
I think you're standing in front of it.

4825
05:06:18,560 --> 05:06:19,560
It makes us run faster.

4826
05:06:19,560 --> 05:06:22,860
It's the torch that's there.

4827
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:24,860
This thing is, like, fun.

4828
05:06:24,860 --> 05:06:25,860
This summons the spheres.

4829
05:06:25,860 --> 05:06:30,040
This summons the ice chunks.

4830
05:06:30,040 --> 05:06:33,040
This summons the skulls that shoot after a second.

4831
05:06:33,040 --> 05:06:36,659
I want a staff.

4832
05:06:36,659 --> 05:06:39,659
Then we're going to have to start doing the mechanical boss.

4833
05:06:39,659 --> 05:06:40,659
Annoying glacial sting.

4834
05:06:40,659 --> 05:06:43,279
Do you want this?

4835
05:06:43,279 --> 05:06:44,279
Oh, well, that's annoying.

4836
05:06:44,279 --> 05:06:45,279
Why would anybody want this?

4837
05:06:45,279 --> 05:06:47,650
Yeah, you're being very annoying right now.

4838
05:06:47,650 --> 05:06:49,650
That means, like, it sucks, right?

4839
05:06:49,650 --> 05:06:52,979
I mean, you can reforge it.

4840
05:06:52,979 --> 05:07:02,599
Oh.

4841
05:07:02,599 --> 05:07:09,770
How do you do that again?

4842
05:07:09,770 --> 05:07:12,770
What's a good thing to make for a pickaxe right now?

4843
05:07:12,770 --> 05:07:19,099
I'm actually forgetting what our next pickaxe progression is.

4844
05:07:19,099 --> 05:07:23,099
I think we're supposed to get cobalt, but I never can find cobalt.

4845
05:07:23,099 --> 05:07:27,099
Maybe it's because cobalt is something different on servers, like lead and iron.

4846
05:07:27,099 --> 05:07:28,659
Right.

4847
05:07:28,659 --> 05:07:32,650
But, oh, hell, that's why I was confused.

4848
05:07:32,650 --> 05:07:39,130
Okay, so I need to go smash more of those alters.

4849
05:07:39,130 --> 05:07:43,590
And then we can start getting better stuff.

4850
05:07:43,590 --> 05:07:45,979
Coming with you.

4851
05:07:45,979 --> 05:07:51,479
Oh, didn't you say to go, like, up in the sky?

4852
05:07:51,479 --> 05:07:55,430
I wanted to find the potion seller for gravity potions,

4853
05:07:55,430 --> 05:07:58,430
and then I was going to do sky stuff, but he wasn't there.

4854
05:07:58,430 --> 05:07:59,430
No.

4855
05:07:59,430 --> 05:08:02,240
I don't know if he's dead or what.

4856
05:08:02,240 --> 05:08:05,319
Trixie the party girl has arrived.

4857
05:08:05,319 --> 05:08:08,319
Yeah, she can go live in a dumpster for all I care.

4858
05:08:08,319 --> 05:08:10,319
Trixie the party girl?

4859
05:08:10,319 --> 05:08:12,319
Yeah, don't talk to her, Jerma.

4860
05:08:12,319 --> 05:08:13,319
Okay.

4861
05:08:13,319 --> 05:08:14,319
You're too good for her.

4862
05:08:14,319 --> 05:08:23,080
Oh, I'm Trixie. I like partying.

4863
05:08:23,080 --> 05:08:25,080
It's my whole identity.

4864
05:08:25,080 --> 05:08:27,840
All right.

4865
05:08:28,840 --> 05:08:30,840
You know, your parents are paying to go to college.

4866
05:08:30,840 --> 05:08:33,080
This is really respectful of you.

4867
05:08:36,080 --> 05:08:38,080
Whenever I go off on, like, a random tangent,

4868
05:08:38,080 --> 05:08:40,080
you start doing the...

4869
05:08:41,080 --> 05:08:42,080
He's not saying...

4870
05:08:42,080 --> 05:08:43,080
I'm just blocking it out.

4871
05:08:43,080 --> 05:08:46,080
I'm blocking out your, like, nonsense.

4872
05:08:46,080 --> 05:08:48,080
I already forgot. Where were we going?

4873
05:08:48,080 --> 05:08:50,080
I don't know. I'm following you.

4874
05:08:50,080 --> 05:08:52,080
Why were we going this way?

4875
05:08:52,080 --> 05:08:56,529
I don't know. You said I'm going to jump real quick.

4876
05:08:57,529 --> 05:09:00,349
Alters. Smash the altars.

4877
05:09:04,650 --> 05:09:07,650
I'm blocking out the crazy things you're saying.

4878
05:09:07,650 --> 05:09:14,560
The world has been blessed.

4879
05:09:14,560 --> 05:09:18,919
Did you bless the world?

4880
05:09:18,919 --> 05:09:20,919
Yeah, that's me destroying altars.

4881
05:09:20,919 --> 05:09:22,919
It adds new wars.

4882
05:09:22,919 --> 05:09:24,919
Wait a minute. Did I just pick up, like, fucking 50 gold?

4883
05:09:24,919 --> 05:09:27,540
Maybe.

4884
05:09:27,540 --> 05:09:29,540
Wait a minute.

4885
05:09:29,540 --> 05:09:37,349
I just saw gold.

4886
05:09:37,349 --> 05:09:47,080
What are you up to down there?

4887
05:09:47,080 --> 05:09:55,840
I'm coming to find out.

4888
05:09:55,840 --> 05:09:57,840
I love that when you show up near me,

4889
05:09:57,840 --> 05:10:01,840
it just means, like, 30 guys are going to go beat up somebody near me.

4890
05:10:01,840 --> 05:10:02,840
Oh, here's Jerma.

4891
05:10:02,840 --> 05:10:04,840
It's pretty great.

4892
05:10:04,840 --> 05:10:10,159
There's, like, a fucking sword over here.

4893
05:10:10,159 --> 05:10:13,400
Lazy Blitzzard?

4894
05:10:13,400 --> 05:10:16,979
This is a huge weapon over there.

4895
05:10:16,979 --> 05:10:18,979
I thought you said you collected everything.

4896
05:10:22,049 --> 05:10:24,419
That item's worth using for you

4897
05:10:24,419 --> 05:10:26,419
just because right-clicking makes you go fast.

4898
05:10:26,419 --> 05:10:28,790
If you hold down right-click with it,

4899
05:10:28,790 --> 05:10:30,790
you'll keep dashing.

4900
05:10:30,790 --> 05:10:33,540
Molten Pick?

4901
05:10:33,540 --> 05:10:35,540
God damn it.

4902
05:10:35,540 --> 05:10:37,540
Yeah, we haven't upgraded our pickaxe in, like, ever.

4903
05:10:37,540 --> 05:10:39,540
I'll be right back.

4904
05:10:39,540 --> 05:10:47,919
What? This is awesome.

4905
05:10:47,919 --> 05:10:49,919
Wait, no. Can you recall the base?

4906
05:10:49,919 --> 05:10:51,919
I'm going to be the base way quicker than you think.

4907
05:10:51,919 --> 05:11:01,330
Who needs a recall?

4908
05:11:01,330 --> 05:11:06,240
I mean...

4909
05:11:06,240 --> 05:11:08,240
Okay, bro.

4910
05:11:08,240 --> 05:11:10,240
Well, it's free, so fine.

4911
05:11:10,240 --> 05:11:12,610
What do you need?

4912
05:11:12,610 --> 05:11:14,610
I need to make a Molten Pickaxe so we can get the new pickaxe.

4913
05:11:14,610 --> 05:11:16,849
I need the Molten Ore.

4914
05:11:16,849 --> 05:11:20,049
This thing is pretty awesome.

4915
05:11:20,049 --> 05:11:22,049
Let me deposit this shit.

4916
05:11:22,049 --> 05:11:24,049
Desert, also, sandstone,

4917
05:11:24,049 --> 05:11:26,740
seed,

4918
05:11:26,740 --> 05:11:28,740
ock, blood droplet,

4919
05:11:28,740 --> 05:11:33,159
lens.

4920
05:11:33,159 --> 05:11:35,330
I need this pickaxe so I can get that pickaxe.

4921
05:11:35,330 --> 05:11:38,529
Mom?

4922
05:11:38,529 --> 05:11:40,529
Mom, everyone has the new pickaxe.

4923
05:11:40,529 --> 05:11:42,529
We forge it. Lazy is back.

4924
05:11:42,529 --> 05:11:44,529
Magma is wrong?

4925
05:11:44,529 --> 05:11:46,529
Molten is five hundred stones.

4926
05:11:46,529 --> 05:11:48,529
Okay, I need the other pickaxe, Mom.

4927
05:11:48,529 --> 05:11:50,529
You bought me the wrong one.

4928
05:11:50,529 --> 05:11:52,529
Minus five hundred percent speed?

4929
05:11:52,529 --> 05:11:54,529
Are they sure?

4930
05:11:54,529 --> 05:12:22,290
I need money.

4931
05:12:22,290 --> 05:12:29,459
Reforge.

4932
05:12:29,459 --> 05:12:37,959
Alright, we're good.

4933
05:12:37,959 --> 05:12:41,860
Superior.

4934
05:12:41,860 --> 05:12:48,069
I don't think that

4935
05:12:48,069 --> 05:12:53,439
debuff was working.

4936
05:12:53,439 --> 05:13:00,360
Maybe it was.

4937
05:13:00,360 --> 05:13:03,750
I need new armor.

4938
05:13:03,750 --> 05:13:05,750
So, can I upgrade this stuff?

4939
05:13:05,750 --> 05:13:07,750
Like the spirit trappers

4940
05:13:07,750 --> 05:13:13,639
stuff.

4941
05:13:13,639 --> 05:13:15,639
This thing looked like it was swinging really fast

4942
05:13:15,639 --> 05:13:17,639
when I did it last time.

4943
05:13:17,639 --> 05:13:20,900
No, it was swinging this fast before.

4944
05:13:20,900 --> 05:13:27,430
Jerma.

4945
05:13:27,430 --> 05:13:29,430
What's up?

4946
05:13:29,430 --> 05:13:31,430
It's fucking mission time. Mission time, alright.

4947
05:13:31,430 --> 05:13:33,599
I need your help in

4948
05:13:33,599 --> 05:13:35,599
locating the underground

4949
05:13:35,599 --> 05:13:38,099
granite subsystem.

4950
05:13:38,099 --> 05:13:41,029
Alright.

4951
05:13:41,029 --> 05:13:43,029
I understand. I think I can help you here.

4952
05:13:43,029 --> 05:13:46,549
You want the underground

4953
05:13:46,549 --> 05:13:48,549
granite subsystem.

4954
05:13:48,549 --> 05:13:50,549
Yeah, that's the subsystem.

4955
05:13:50,549 --> 05:13:57,970
What's your favorite pizza?

4956
05:13:57,970 --> 05:14:00,150
What's going on with all these people down here?

4957
05:14:00,150 --> 05:14:02,150
Did you put these people down here?

4958
05:14:02,150 --> 05:14:04,150
Yeah.

4959
05:14:04,150 --> 05:14:07,159
You're a fucking monster.

4960
05:14:07,159 --> 05:14:09,159
They're banished.

4961
05:14:09,159 --> 05:14:11,159
They're not even good enough for the prison.

4962
05:14:11,159 --> 05:14:13,909
At least let them

4963
05:14:13,909 --> 05:14:16,400
walk around down here.

4964
05:14:16,400 --> 05:14:18,400
No.

4965
05:14:18,400 --> 05:14:27,880
Why is it free wood in here?

4966
05:14:27,880 --> 05:14:31,459
What do you want down here?

4967
05:14:31,459 --> 05:14:33,459
Are you looking for the granite land?

4968
05:14:33,459 --> 05:14:35,459
It's like a purple looking area.

4969
05:14:35,459 --> 05:14:37,759
It's an area.

4970
05:14:37,759 --> 05:14:39,759
And we need it.

4971
05:14:39,759 --> 05:14:42,130
Purple looking area.

4972
05:14:42,130 --> 05:14:44,130
Yeah, it's fucking purple.

4973
05:14:44,130 --> 05:14:46,819
Alright, okay.

4974
05:14:46,819 --> 05:14:49,250
I don't know where it is.

4975
05:14:49,250 --> 05:14:51,939
So we kind of just have to explore.

4976
05:14:51,939 --> 05:14:53,939
How many torches do you have?

4977
05:14:53,939 --> 05:14:57,650
Did you use all the...

4978
05:14:57,650 --> 05:14:59,650
I gave you like 500.

4979
05:14:59,650 --> 05:15:01,650
Well, you did, but

4980
05:15:01,650 --> 05:15:03,650
let's see what's happening is

4981
05:15:03,650 --> 05:15:05,650
I have deposit all and I'm not all clicking them

4982
05:15:05,650 --> 05:15:07,650
and I deposit them all back in.

4983
05:15:07,650 --> 05:15:09,650
Okay, because you just deposit all.

4984
05:15:09,650 --> 05:15:11,650
That's all you ever do.

4985
05:15:11,650 --> 05:15:13,650
No, that's not true.

4986
05:15:13,650 --> 05:15:15,650
I do look at a lot of things.

4987
05:15:15,650 --> 05:15:17,650
I do go over lots of things.

4988
05:15:17,650 --> 05:15:19,650
But if you come to me

4989
05:15:19,650 --> 05:15:21,650
I have 1400 in hand.

4990
05:15:21,650 --> 05:15:23,650
Well, that's good.

4991
05:15:23,650 --> 05:15:28,130
There's a big fish down there.

4992
05:15:28,130 --> 05:15:34,959
Yeah, honey?

4993
05:15:34,959 --> 05:15:37,330
Look, a fish!

4994
05:15:37,330 --> 05:15:39,330
Alright, give me that shit.

4995
05:15:39,330 --> 05:15:41,330
Ah, dude, you know who I fucking need?

4996
05:15:41,330 --> 05:15:43,330
Here, you stay here.

4997
05:15:43,330 --> 05:15:45,330
God, I still don't have a fucking mirror.

4998
05:15:48,470 --> 05:15:50,470
Sorry, I'm having a meltdown.

4999
05:15:50,470 --> 05:15:54,180
Why don't you just take mine and then come back to me?

5000
05:15:54,180 --> 05:15:56,180
I can do that.

5001
05:15:56,180 --> 05:15:58,180
You better get this back.

5002
05:15:58,180 --> 05:16:01,619
Okay.

5003
05:16:01,619 --> 05:16:03,619
Why is it doing that?

5004
05:16:03,619 --> 05:16:06,689
Do you have an alt selected?

5005
05:16:06,689 --> 05:16:08,689
Oh, well, that would be a thing now, wouldn't it?

5006
05:16:14,959 --> 05:16:16,959
You're never getting this back.

5007
05:16:16,959 --> 05:16:20,229
Hey, it's Popo.

5008
05:16:20,229 --> 05:16:25,919
Glow sticks, cool.

5009
05:16:25,919 --> 05:16:27,919
That's one of my torches that you promised.

5010
05:16:31,250 --> 05:16:33,250
Do you want to find something specific?

5011
05:16:33,250 --> 05:16:36,389
You keep on going...

5012
05:16:36,389 --> 05:16:39,720
Uh...

5013
05:16:39,720 --> 05:16:41,889
Don't tell me what you're doing.

5014
05:16:41,889 --> 05:16:43,889
I forgot what I was doing.

5015
05:16:43,889 --> 05:16:45,889
We're doing a psychotic amulet.

5016
05:16:45,889 --> 05:16:55,299
Glow sticks are amazing.

5017
05:16:55,299 --> 05:16:57,299
They work in water. Nice.

5018
05:16:57,299 --> 05:17:00,819
Nice.

5019
05:17:00,819 --> 05:17:04,080
No, that's like, nice.

5020
05:17:04,080 --> 05:17:09,720
Oh, what's this?

5021
05:17:09,720 --> 05:17:11,720
I can't get this. This is too good of a material.

5022
05:17:11,720 --> 05:17:15,169
What is this?

5023
05:17:15,169 --> 05:17:17,169
That's why we're on this mission.

5024
05:17:17,169 --> 05:17:19,169
We need to find... I added the new resources to the world,

5025
05:17:19,169 --> 05:17:21,169
but we can't mine them yet.

5026
05:17:21,169 --> 05:17:23,169
So we need to find the

5027
05:17:23,169 --> 05:17:25,169
granite area.

5028
05:17:25,169 --> 05:17:27,349
Because there are...

5029
05:17:27,349 --> 05:17:29,349
There's a way to get a pickaxe from that.

5030
05:17:29,349 --> 05:17:33,569
Wait a minute. Hold on.

5031
05:17:33,569 --> 05:17:36,959
Purple.

5032
05:17:36,959 --> 05:17:38,959
Oh, shit. I know what I'm doing and I can't do it.

5033
05:17:38,959 --> 05:17:47,400
I can't fucking mine this either.

5034
05:17:47,400 --> 05:17:51,750
There's something over here too.

5035
05:17:51,750 --> 05:17:54,880
Where? In here?

5036
05:17:54,880 --> 05:17:56,880
Where's the heart?

5037
05:17:56,880 --> 05:18:09,360
There it is. A life crystal.

5038
05:18:09,360 --> 05:18:17,810
So,

5039
05:18:17,810 --> 05:18:19,810
we're trying to find the material to be able to get

5040
05:18:19,810 --> 05:18:21,810
new axes to be able to

5041
05:18:21,810 --> 05:18:23,810
mine the shit that's down here.

5042
05:18:23,810 --> 05:18:43,060
Use heart.

5043
05:18:43,060 --> 05:18:45,619
What? I can't.

5044
05:18:45,619 --> 05:18:48,689
Why does everybody keep telling me to do that?

5045
05:18:48,689 --> 05:19:04,549
Like, how...

5046
05:19:04,549 --> 05:19:06,549
Silt. Stone.

5047
05:19:06,549 --> 05:19:13,520
Stone. Stone.

5048
05:19:13,520 --> 05:19:15,520
Mine the tote pouch. Yes.

5049
05:19:15,520 --> 05:19:17,520
Yes, yes, yes.

5050
05:19:17,520 --> 05:19:19,520
Yes.

5051
05:19:19,520 --> 05:19:25,540
Don't mine the tote pouch. Don't listen to your chat.

5052
05:19:25,540 --> 05:19:28,799
You have one thing that you need to do.

5053
05:19:28,799 --> 05:19:30,799
And you have yet to

5054
05:19:30,799 --> 05:19:32,799
describe what that thing is.

5055
05:19:32,799 --> 05:19:34,799
The granite. It's a purple biome. You cannot miss it.

5056
05:19:34,799 --> 05:19:36,799
It is like a dark purple area.

5057
05:19:36,799 --> 05:19:38,799
It's somewhere underground.

5058
05:19:38,799 --> 05:19:40,799
Last time you tried to explain it, you went, uh...

5059
05:19:40,799 --> 05:19:44,130
That was like, I don't... What?

5060
05:19:44,130 --> 05:19:48,340
No.

5061
05:19:48,340 --> 05:19:50,340
You found it? It's... Oh, you did find it, you fuck.

5062
05:19:50,340 --> 05:19:53,409
Dirty fuck.

5063
05:19:53,409 --> 05:20:09,540
You are absolutely

5064
05:20:09,540 --> 05:20:12,549
filthy.

5065
05:20:12,549 --> 05:20:16,389
What are you guys talking about? Am I underwater?

5066
05:20:16,389 --> 05:20:19,080
Yes, I am.

5067
05:20:19,080 --> 05:20:21,080
Hey!

5068
05:20:21,080 --> 05:20:23,080
To your left, and that's a boss that spawned in it.

5069
05:20:23,080 --> 05:20:26,400
It should be really weak for

5070
05:20:26,400 --> 05:20:37,029
how strong we are right now.

5071
05:20:37,029 --> 05:20:40,799
This is a boss?

5072
05:20:40,799 --> 05:20:42,799
Do you listen to me?

5073
05:20:42,799 --> 05:20:44,799
I was saying, this is a boss?

5074
05:20:44,799 --> 05:20:46,799
Like, as in, it's not,

5075
05:20:46,799 --> 05:20:48,799
shouldn't be. It's like a standard enemy. Not, hey, is this a boss?

5076
05:20:48,799 --> 05:20:50,799
It's

5077
05:20:50,799 --> 05:20:52,799
from before hard mode.

5078
05:20:52,799 --> 05:20:54,799
I was mocking it.

5079
05:20:54,799 --> 05:20:56,799
Like, this is a boss?

5080
05:20:56,799 --> 05:20:58,799
No. You're covering for yourself.

5081
05:20:58,799 --> 05:21:00,799
I am not. I appreciate that you'd go to those lengths

5082
05:21:00,799 --> 05:21:02,799
to me. Listen to that clip, and you'll hear that it was like,

5083
05:21:02,799 --> 05:21:04,799
this is a boss?

5084
05:21:04,799 --> 05:21:11,400
Rannet block. Yeah.

5085
05:21:11,400 --> 05:21:15,110
This is a block?

5086
05:21:15,110 --> 05:21:17,110
Rannet? See, I'm not hearing it.

5087
05:21:17,110 --> 05:21:21,330
Energy core. Wound stone.

5088
05:21:21,330 --> 05:21:23,569
Ooh. Ooh.

5089
05:21:23,569 --> 05:21:25,569
There's a guy down here. There he is. Mr. Wizard.

5090
05:21:25,569 --> 05:21:28,709
Oh, he found him.

5091
05:21:28,709 --> 05:21:32,790
Where'd he go? Found the wizard.

5092
05:21:32,790 --> 05:21:34,790
Hey, friend, this bondage was starting to chafe.

5093
05:21:34,790 --> 05:21:39,009
Crystal ball.

5094
05:21:39,009 --> 05:21:42,020
Ice rod. Ooh.

5095
05:21:42,020 --> 05:21:44,020
Oh. Here. Take your stupid ice mirror.

5096
05:21:44,020 --> 05:21:47,279
29 damage.

5097
05:21:47,279 --> 05:21:50,360
Someone's a block of ice?

5098
05:21:50,360 --> 05:21:53,040
Is this any good?

5099
05:21:53,040 --> 05:21:56,439
Uh, I think his stuff is dated.

5100
05:21:56,439 --> 05:21:58,439
I'm not sure.

5101
05:21:58,439 --> 05:22:00,439
Crystal ball. Functions as a demon altar.

5102
05:22:00,439 --> 05:22:05,349
Guard thing.

5103
05:22:05,349 --> 05:22:07,349
Oh, dude, crystal ball. That's actually, I'm getting one.

5104
05:22:07,349 --> 05:22:09,349
Do you have 10 gold on you?

5105
05:22:09,349 --> 05:22:11,349
I have three.

5106
05:22:11,349 --> 05:22:14,099
Ah!

5107
05:22:14,099 --> 05:22:16,979
Isn't, what, aren't you gonna, like,

5108
05:22:16,979 --> 05:22:19,279
trap this guy somewhere?

5109
05:22:19,279 --> 05:22:21,279
Uh, I'm, yeah, he auto moves into

5110
05:22:21,279 --> 05:22:25,189
one of the trap houses.

5111
05:22:25,189 --> 05:22:27,189
He auto, hold on a minute.

5112
05:22:27,189 --> 05:22:29,189
He auto moves into one of the

5113
05:22:29,189 --> 05:22:31,189
trap houses. Yeah. Yeah.

5114
05:22:31,189 --> 05:22:33,189
He gets caught in the trap. How do you move in,

5115
05:22:33,189 --> 05:22:35,189
how do you move into a house that traps you?

5116
05:22:35,189 --> 05:22:37,189
Most of rap is

5117
05:22:37,189 --> 05:22:39,939
about this exact situation.

5118
05:22:39,939 --> 05:22:41,939
Here, will you take?

5119
05:22:41,939 --> 05:22:48,400
There's silver bars in here.

5120
05:22:48,400 --> 05:22:50,400
Oh, sick. We found a way to summon one of the

5121
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:52,400
skeleton bot, uh, mechanical bots.

5122
05:22:52,400 --> 05:22:55,220
So we can do that.

5123
05:22:55,220 --> 05:22:57,220
And then you can use hollow bars to make a pickaxe,

5124
05:22:57,220 --> 05:22:59,220
right, chat, right?

5125
05:22:59,220 --> 05:23:01,220
Or does hollow bars not have a pickaxe?

5126
05:23:01,220 --> 05:23:11,200
Anybody know? Yes. Correct.

5127
05:23:11,200 --> 05:23:13,200
Yes. Everyone's saying yes.

5128
05:23:13,200 --> 05:23:16,580
Okay.

5129
05:23:16,580 --> 05:23:18,580
Hollow bars have a pickaxe. You also need the boss souls.

5130
05:23:18,580 --> 05:23:21,139
So yeah, we're gonna have to do all

5131
05:23:21,139 --> 05:23:23,139
the mechanical bosses then.

5132
05:23:23,139 --> 05:23:25,139
Hooray. Which is a pain.

5133
05:23:25,139 --> 05:23:27,639
But that's one down.

5134
05:23:27,639 --> 05:23:32,689
Uh, because

5135
05:23:32,689 --> 05:23:34,689
in the granite area,

5136
05:23:34,689 --> 05:23:36,689
I'm trying to remember,

5137
05:23:36,689 --> 05:23:38,689
like, no enemies are spawning

5138
05:23:38,689 --> 05:23:40,689
and this place sucks.

5139
05:23:40,689 --> 05:23:43,380
One of the golems drops

5140
05:23:43,380 --> 05:23:46,319
the, like, geode

5141
05:23:46,319 --> 05:23:48,319
clump or something.

5142
05:23:48,319 --> 05:23:51,270
And the geodes allow you

5143
05:23:51,270 --> 05:23:56,259
to make a pickaxe. But there's

5144
05:23:56,259 --> 05:23:58,259
no enemies here.

5145
05:23:58,259 --> 05:24:00,259
And I'm kind of pissed.

5146
05:24:00,259 --> 05:24:02,259
If I had a six,

5147
05:24:02,259 --> 05:24:04,259
if I had a clone,

5148
05:24:04,259 --> 05:24:06,259
if I had a tiny clone of star, would I torture it?

5149
05:24:06,259 --> 05:24:11,119
He wouldn't, he does.

5150
05:24:11,119 --> 05:24:15,599
You mean like a

5151
05:24:15,599 --> 05:24:17,599
doll, like a voodoo doll or something?

5152
05:24:17,599 --> 05:24:29,560
Uh, no.

5153
05:24:29,560 --> 05:24:40,560
No, I wouldn't. I'm just gonna keep going this way.

5154
05:24:40,560 --> 05:24:43,509
Drop it in the lava.

5155
05:24:43,509 --> 05:24:54,959
I'm not gonna use

5156
05:24:54,959 --> 05:24:56,959
a voodoo doll on somebody.

5157
05:24:56,959 --> 05:25:01,959
If anything, I would, like, have a voodoo doll

5158
05:25:01,959 --> 05:25:03,959
of somebody and, like,

5159
05:25:03,959 --> 05:25:05,959
cook bacon around it.

5160
05:25:05,959 --> 05:25:08,709
So it would be like, hmm, what's that

5161
05:25:08,709 --> 05:25:16,069
bacon smell? I would put, like,

5162
05:25:16,069 --> 05:25:18,069
Money on its hands and shit.

5163
05:25:18,069 --> 05:25:26,900
I would light incense

5164
05:25:26,900 --> 05:25:28,900
and have, like, aromatherapy around it. So you just, like,

5165
05:25:28,900 --> 05:25:33,319
felt better? That's not how it works.

5166
05:25:33,319 --> 05:25:35,319
I know it's not how it works.

5167
05:25:35,319 --> 05:25:37,319
Alright, Yerma! Yerma! Yerma! Yerma!

5168
05:25:37,319 --> 05:25:39,319
Yes?

5169
05:25:39,319 --> 05:25:41,319
It's a back to town. I'm getting

5170
05:25:41,319 --> 05:25:43,490
areolite ore.

5171
05:25:43,490 --> 05:25:45,490
That's more important. No one cares.

5172
05:25:45,490 --> 05:25:49,270
You just wanna skip everything.

5173
05:25:49,270 --> 05:25:53,240

that draiden failed to rectify in time i see that you have awakened that is old toy that is mod added

5235
05:37:31,040 --> 05:37:36,080
lore okay it's the most pointless thing you could be reading i didn't know if it was like a material

5236
05:37:36,159 --> 05:37:51,080
or something or like a boss thing or lore i think i deposited my other one of these

5237

5241
05:38:24,000 --> 05:38:29,889
called what a soul of fright is what he dropped that's not what we need

5242
05:38:51,299 --> 05:39:06,610
either way we need a mithril anvil oh this part's annoying didn't have another one that was more

5243
05:39:06,610 --> 05:39:20,979
item range i forget what it was called thanks bunny duck my foot hurts a lot sorry to hear that

5245
05:39:42,389 --> 05:40:15,040
bag in here vampire did you get vampire mask vampire pants why is everybody freaking out in

5246
05:40:15,040 --> 05:40:23,889
here everyone's like what what what's going on what nothing's going on no no something like

5247
05:40:23,889 --> 05:40:35,669
something major is going on what are you talking about something what something something what

5248
05:40:35,669 --> 05:40:40,709
somebody was streaming that's what you sound like something something what that's what you sound like

5249
05:40:40,709 --> 05:40:45,919
apparently somebody was like in the top of just chatting streaming porn

5250
05:40:47,250 --> 05:40:56,340
oh actually someone was saying that in my chat nice how many people it had 20 000 viewers

5251
05:40:58,000 --> 05:41:07,040
why did it take an hour to put that down what i don't know it's late on the west coast i guess

5252
05:41:07,759 --> 05:41:15,409
it's not that late it's like not even 10 o'clock i mean it's not like i don't know if they have like

5253
05:41:15,409 --> 05:41:19,889
24 hour moderators on every single channel just to make sure someone doesn't do something wrong

5254
05:41:19,970 --> 05:41:25,250
no but did you hear how many people were there yeah but they're historically very slow at these

5255
05:41:25,250 --> 05:41:34,450
things and very inconsistent in their moderation so i'm not surprised i guess is what i'm getting

5256
05:41:34,450 --> 05:41:38,130
at it's like yeah that sucks but i'm not surprised i mean it's just kind of bizarre

5257
05:41:43,000 --> 05:41:50,529
we need to make sure it's really hard is this something we want i got to check with my supervisor

5258
05:41:51,250 --> 05:42:04,290
are we doing porn now 20 000 people there that's that's fucking insane all right um so what's next

5259
05:42:05,090 --> 05:42:09,889
by the way what uh what's your what's your like time frame here how you doing uh i don't want to

5260
05:42:09,889 --> 05:42:17,909
go much longer i've i've been a good sleep schedule boy yes um is it as midnight for you i'd like to

5261
05:42:17,909 --> 05:42:22,549
go a little oh yeah i'd like to go a little bit longer just so i can get this pickaxe thing out

5262
05:42:22,549 --> 05:42:31,509
of the way yeah so that the path is clear when we next start so what i'm doing is i got a gel

5263
05:42:31,509 --> 05:42:39,439
pickaxe so that i can mine one of the new ores and get you a pickaxe and then we can mine the

5264
05:42:39,439 --> 05:42:47,119
other ores and have a good old mine fest mine now i can get palladium then i can make a palladium

5265
05:42:47,119 --> 05:42:51,360
pickaxe and then we can start making a mithral anvil and that kind of stuff actually maybe now

5266
05:42:51,360 --> 05:43:01,090
is like a decent spot to stop is it yeah it's kind of like the uh the true start to uh the hard

5267
05:43:01,090 --> 05:43:06,770
mode okay because we haven't even gotten a single ore yet we only did one mechanical box it's been

5268
05:43:06,770 --> 05:43:13,490
six hours it's been we've played for a while yeah time flies when you tararia yeah it kind of

5269
05:43:13,490 --> 05:43:23,439
it was five hours before i looked at the clock it was really fun though it's all right how much

5270
05:43:23,439 --> 05:43:28,880
more like okay percentage wise like how much more is there left to do that's reasonable to do

5271
05:43:28,880 --> 05:43:33,919
not like oh i want to beat the last boss that has five trillion hp and i need every item in the game

5272
05:43:37,000 --> 05:43:44,799
of the normal terraria game it's these three new ores gearing up whatever you want to get then you

5273
05:43:44,799 --> 05:43:52,799
fight uh plantera isn't a big boss and golem is done pretty quickly after that then i'm pretty

5274
05:43:52,799 --> 05:43:57,759
sure right after golem you've got cultist then you have the lunar pillars and then you have

5275
05:43:58,959 --> 05:44:03,279
the moon lord which is the classic final finish and then calamity has a bunch of

5276
05:44:03,279 --> 05:44:10,659
shit after that and thorium has one boss after that so like even if we didn't do the super

5277
05:44:10,659 --> 05:44:16,979
late game calamity stuff i'd say we're at most halfway through but probably less than halfway

5278
05:44:18,759 --> 05:44:23,159
i mean i'll i'll finish it i'll like at least get to the end of like the actual game

5279
05:44:24,040 --> 05:44:27,439
do it again yeah getting to the end of calamity is a little bit

5280
05:44:28,319 --> 05:44:32,720
but like some of the late game calamity stuff just gets so obnoxious to craft and the amount of stuff

5281
05:44:32,720 --> 05:44:38,400
you have to keep track of is like not actually fun anymore for me i don't know i mean that's

5282
05:44:38,400 --> 05:44:43,279
that would be something i would want to do like on my own time i think yeah but uh actually there's

5283
05:44:45,279 --> 05:44:49,919
very easily another stream we wouldn't be done yeah i don't think unless we like really rushed

5284
05:44:49,919 --> 05:44:56,959
it and i don't think we're gonna do that yeah well see you hey see you next week for uh terraria

5285
05:44:57,919 --> 05:45:06,310
are these things quacking terraria episode three episode three actually well we would have done

5286
05:45:06,310 --> 05:45:10,790
this this would have been episode let's see six hours we did how long was the last week's stream

5287
05:45:10,790 --> 05:45:15,909
like six oh you're doing in like actual episode well because it would be a youtube episode each

5288
05:45:15,909 --> 05:45:21,189
episode would be about 10 to 15 minutes all right we'll say 20 no way more than a longer game you

5289
05:45:21,189 --> 05:45:25,270
do 20 because then you 20 i don't know you can get two ads in it you can get the mid roll

5290
05:45:25,270 --> 05:45:33,490
uh-huh okay so two four that's three episodes an hour three four six three three six nine

5291

5293
05:45:56,290 --> 05:46:02,049

5294
05:46:02,049 --> 05:46:11,169
didn't start so late start so late let's start at like five p.m it was like it was like three

5305
05:47:14,450 --> 05:47:22,180
least six hours sometimes they're a little shorter but sometimes they also go like 11 to 12 hours too

in boston it's like it's hard to even tell you to go to one but i would definitely say museum of

5449
06:08:49,959 --> 06:08:55,400
science if you have like young siblings or cousins or something that you're with uh children's museum

5450
06:08:56,360 --> 06:09:05,779
then uh faneuil hall i'd say that's probably let me check out like you check out you know um like fenway

5451
06:09:05,779 --> 06:09:10,419
fenway is awesome too if you can get in the you like baseball even just being around fenway it's

5452
06:09:10,419 --> 06:09:14,500
like right in there so you got plenty of opportunities to kind of be part of the scene

5453
06:09:15,299 --> 06:09:21,759
it's pretty good i i i wouldn't recommend the duck boats i don't think that's kind of i would

5454
06:09:21,759 --> 06:09:32,560
i don't know if i would recommend somebody to do that there's nothing wrong with the duck boats

5455
06:09:32,560 --> 06:09:41,919
but the duck boats really is a kind of i'm out of town guy in a hawaiian shirt with the kind of

5456
06:09:42,959 --> 06:09:49,240
sunscreen all over his nose and glasses around his neck kind of thing to do you know what i'm

5457
06:09:49,240 --> 06:09:57,220
saying it's a very like touristy thing to do i don't know if it's you just kind of float around

5458
06:09:57,220 --> 06:10:02,580
and drive around and they if you really really want to do something insanely touristy

5459
06:10:03,139 --> 06:10:15,439
uh boston has a pretty famous duck boats but if you if you're into that then absolutely do it

5460
06:10:16,319 --> 06:10:24,099
it is a subterranean vehicle it goes on the ground and then goes underground well no you don't like

5461
06:10:24,099 --> 06:10:29,060
it just it floats it's a boat it's a boat it's a car boat that drives around and you float you don't

5462
06:10:29,060 --> 06:10:43,759

5480
06:13:21,119 --> 06:13:29,240
wrong here going from making a video that is seven to eight minutes and not having to be live in

5481
06:13:29,240 --> 06:13:35,569
front of people for more than you know i didn't really do it that often you like kind of build

5482
06:13:35,569 --> 06:13:43,569
up your comfort level to do it and i'm not gonna lie two years ago three years ago it was a

5483
06:13:43,569 --> 06:13:48,369
difference it was it's a lot different it was a big change to hey instead of sitting here and

5484
06:13:48,369 --> 06:13:53,490
like playing a game and trying to do like funny weird interesting things and in dark souls and

5485
06:13:53,490 --> 06:13:58,689
you're not even getting out of the tutorial room for two or three hours it was hey i'm gonna be

5486
06:13:58,689 --> 06:14:05,560
here and these people gonna be here there's no use nobody used to be in the room you know like

5487
06:14:05,560 --> 06:14:14,439
nobody is in the room now but it was just me and transitioning from it's just me to there

5488
06:14:14,439 --> 06:14:19,880
might be thousands of people here you need to kind of build up like a stamina to be able to

5489
06:14:20,520 --> 06:14:27,560
oh it's been an hour or two okay um i think i'm done it's been three hours uh yeah that's uh

5490
06:14:27,880 --> 06:14:52,680
bye nobody to yell that the joke you just said sucked yeah that's yeah like you know what i mean

5491
06:14:52,680 --> 06:14:59,619
it's like different it's a different beast i could say something stupid and then put it in a youtube

5492
06:14:59,619 --> 06:15:03,860
video and not know if people thought it was funny until like potentially a week later

5493
06:15:05,919 --> 06:15:19,619
i get instant feedback now so yeah and now i can stream for six seven eight hours at a time and

5494
06:15:19,619 --> 06:15:46,680
it's fine never it didn't use to be the case though instant conflict yeah but yeah that's

5495
06:15:47,639 --> 06:15:55,750
that's 50 bucks from phylactery thank you and then finally here tingy can we make it official

5496
06:15:55,750 --> 06:16:04,790
and call these weekly streams sterarius saturdays no yeah i i've come to the decision and realization

5497
06:16:04,790 --> 06:16:12,069
that you cannot name anything a day of the week ever again because oh it's scare saturdays it's

5498
06:16:12,069 --> 06:16:17,680
terraria saturdays what if we can't do it on saturday oh shit we have to do it on saturday now

5499
06:16:18,979 --> 06:16:22,900
there has to be a scare saturdays on saturday instead of just being just do it when you can

5500
06:16:24,099 --> 06:16:32,689
you know what if we do a terraria on friday it's like oh shit man time to rebrand everything

5501
06:16:33,490 --> 06:16:51,619
so i'm against naming days of the week in a title stop scare saturdays because you're a coward

5502
06:16:51,619 --> 06:16:58,479
yeah i don't know fine say it but i also ran out of like kind of scary games to play for a little

5503
06:16:58,479 --> 06:17:05,599
while but scary games suck they're really fucking stressful and i'll tell you i'm not going to

5504
06:17:05,599 --> 06:17:11,200
bullshit you it got to a point where it would be like thursday night and i would know i was

5505
06:17:11,200 --> 06:17:14,799
going to record something for saturday or like friday night or even even on saturday afternoon

5506
06:17:15,439 --> 06:17:19,680
and i'd be like fuck man i don't i don't want to play scary game right now fuck it's going to

5507
06:17:19,680 --> 06:17:21,360
scare me i'm gonna get like stressed out and

5508
06:17:28,389 --> 06:17:41,840
it you're gonna have to make yourself want to do it in a way jump scares and all that yeah

5509
06:17:44,020 --> 06:17:52,799
vr horror games are a blast to watch you play i had to have lost at least a few years of my life

5510
06:17:54,959 --> 06:17:57,439
there was at least two or three parts of that game that would just

5511
06:17:58,319 --> 06:18:05,919
it was such a jump in such a scary scenario that it my like i definitely took at least like

5512
06:18:05,919 --> 06:18:10,479
three years of blood pumping capability away from my heart like at the end of my life

5513
06:18:11,599 --> 06:18:22,159
unless i'm a super high strong neurotic kind of person anyways so you add in terrifying jump

5514
06:18:22,159 --> 06:18:37,189
scares just dials it up to a thousand but let's uh get the credits on here these are all the subs
