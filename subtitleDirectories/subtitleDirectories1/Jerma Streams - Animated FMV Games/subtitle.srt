1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:12,419
Good afternoon. Sorry, I am a few minutes late. I had some car trouble that I had to take care

2
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:32,250
of and I just finished it all. So I'm ready to go. Yeah, it's just annoying stuff. Let's just

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:48,490
leave it at that. I drive my car every day. Sometimes you run into a problem. Well, I don't

4
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:59,509
drive every single day, right? But, you know, on most days I drive my car. I'm the vroomer.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,450
Yeah, I do this thing where I attach like a loud noise to the back of my muffler.

6
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:28,459
And even when I'm going like 32 miles per hour, it goes. I thought it was cool. Anyways, I hope

7
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:35,939
you're having a good day. Hope you're having a good start to your week here. I have been compiling

8
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,849
some FMV full motion video games for the last, I don't know, probably a few weeks.

9
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:51,769
And we're going to do it for the next few days. We're going to start today with the animated stuff.

10
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:59,670
I've actually never played Dragon's Lair ever. This is one of the most iconic classic video

11
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:08,620
games ever made. I've never played it ever. I've only seen I think like 12 seconds of this game's

12
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:23,379
animation. There's a Dragon's Lair 2. I mean, why not? There are the Space Ace. And then there's

13
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:30,650
another game called Kingdom. And there's another one too. There's two Kingdoms. And most of these

14
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,189
are on Steam. I didn't even know these games are on Steam. They like remade these games. And I

15
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,800
didn't even know this. So depending on how long this takes, we're just going to go through the

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,620
animated stuff today. And then tomorrow, I'm going to try to get the other ones to work too.

17
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,539
You will know if I ran into a bunch of technical problems later tonight into tomorrow, because

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:06,870
we'll be playing Greedfall tomorrow if I can't figure it out. But which I don't want to do,

19
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:19,240
because why do I not want to do that? Because Greedfall looks really great on paper.

20
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,860
But apparently it's a very slow paced game. Lots of dialogue. And you know how my attention span

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,740
is about... I have the attention span about a cube worth of cheese. You know what I mean?

22
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:45,930
That's all I got. Because I go for it and whack. Anyways, let's get started. This is Dragon's Lair.

23
00:03:54,979 --> 00:04:04,550
Oh, I just like... I laughed at my own shitty joke and it hurt me. It's got good music. Let's

24
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:16,040
get the music on here so you can hear it. I have joke thorns. Yeah, but wouldn't that mean that I

25
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:32,389
know? And hey, Dragon's Lair, presented by John Bluth. I think this game only takes

26
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,709
like 40 minutes to beat, but it's ridiculously difficult, is what I've heard. This is a

27
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,629
make a choice within a tenth of a second and lose. So the actual video game is about 30 minutes long,

28
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:59,589
but it might take like three hours to do this. I don't know. I'm just setting myself up for

29
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,259
for what I think might happen. Are you ready? Are we ready for the opening cut scene?

30
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,709
Derma's not good at games either. I've never heard... I've heard of this game.

31
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,449
I've seen the mouth animations and I was like, holy shit, those are pretty good mouth animations.

32
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:39,139
You ready? Three. All right, start over. One. Go. Oh god. Lives. Three. Five. I can't do more than

33
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,209
five. Play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet. Dirk will start in a new scene

34
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:57,879
if he dies. Yeah, that's... how do I do that one? What is move beeps? Move guide? Arcade cabinet.

35
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:13,879
On or off? Probably off. Mode arcade. Difficulty. They're gonna keep it on hard. This mode features

36
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:20,620
more moves and requires quicker reactions for certain scenes. Good luck. Turn it all off. What

37
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:27,720
do you mean? No, I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing. I don't even know what the

38
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,079
fuck I'm doing. I'm not turning off this shit. I have no idea what's going on. All right,

39
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm going for it. You ready? I'm not turning the move guide off. To play Dragon's Lair,

40
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,199
you'll need to make the correct move at the right time. In this scene, Dirk will fall through the

41
00:06:50,199 --> 00:07:00,620
drawbridge. It's time to make a move. To survive... I couldn't even read that.

42
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:11,930
I'm dead. To play Dragon's Lair, you need to make the correct move at the right time. I'm

43
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,819
not gonna be able to beat this. In this scene, Dirk will fall through the drawbridge and you

44
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,060
have to swing the... Okay, so there's sword. Can I... Do I have to press it with my mouse?

45
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,819
Touch the sword button. Okay, yeah.

46
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:39,959
Come on out. You made the correct move. I did. Can I... I can't do like up, down, left, right?

47
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,459
I'm gonna misclick so many fucking times. Throughout the game, you'll need to make up,

48
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,579
down, left, right, and sword. What the fuck? Slow down. All right.

49
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:11,339
Why is it starting from the beginning? Okay. Jump. Okay, got that one. That one. And this one.

50
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:29,610
What happened? Wait, what is going on? What the fuck? I have no idea what's going on.

51
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:37,299
Why have I started, like, random places? Why did I start at a random place?

52
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,190
I have no idea what just happened.

53
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Am I in arcade mode? Why did I... Why did I fly through the house?

54
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:03,700
That was fucking ridiculous. I just angry burst into the castle wall. Okay, hold on a minute.

55
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:11,100
New game. Three lives, move beams, move guide, arcade cabinet, arcade.

56
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,909
Dirk will start in a new scene if he dies. Okay. There we are.

57
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:28,360
Now this makes fucking sense. Here we go. We're doing the laser gist version. I'm ready.

58
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,730
Turn the volume down. Is it long? Okay, this part, it's the squid.

59
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:55,460
Okay. Then I go in the door. Here's the... This door. I made it, right? What?

60
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:04,460
I thought I didn't press the button. Guys, I think I might have to put this on easy.

61
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
Sometimes you have to press it twice. Okay.

62
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,759
So then it gets us into this room. The rocket ball. Gotta go to the right.

63
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:44,649
Okay. Got it. And now there's a bed. It's too fast. It's happening too fast.

64
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,370
I just keep killing them. Oh, here we go. Quickly through the door.

65
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,429
Okay, so you have to dive through. Drink me.

66
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:26,870
What am I doing? I can't. Don't drink. I can't take it. I can't. Let's try it again.

67
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:34,730
We're in the drink me room. Don't drink. Wait. Go this way. Watch out.

68
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:59,269
I gotta wait. Slash. No, I gotta run. Slash. Up. Slash. Right. Slash. Got it. Straight. Straight.

69
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:09,620
Straight. That sucks. Straight. Straight. And...

70
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Over. And...

71
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,129
This is like trying to remember a dream. You know when you have a fucking nightmare

72
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:35,049
and during the nightmare it's completely vivid. Everything is happening in real time.

73
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,090
Right when you wake up from the nightmare, this is what it's like remembering the dream.

74
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,919
It's like, what? Then I got hit in the head with a fucking rake. And then it was lava.

75
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,240
And then I got killed and I fell down the stairs and... Wait, I forget. I kind of don't remember.

76
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,340
Get the gold. How many times do I have to go around in a circle?

77
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:25,350
All right. Right. Right. And straight. Right. Right. Straight. Grab.

78
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:59,720
I get it, I think. Okay. Door. Open door. Kill it. Kill it quick. Oh my god. This is too intense.

79
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:14,549
I gotta go up. This is super fast paced. It really is. It's like a thousand miles per hour.

80
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:38,230
All right. It's slash and then up. Go. Grab an axe. And then right. Grab the axe. Right. Straight. Down. Right.

81
00:14:40,629 --> 00:15:00,379
Okay. Slash. Right. Down. Right. Left. Up. I did it. Okay. Holy shit.

82
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:05,480
Just go up the stairs.

83
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:27,980
Go this way. Quick. Thank god there are continues. Otherwise, I would never complete this.

84
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:43,620
Turn off the continues. You really want me to do that shit? Are you sure about that?

85
00:15:43,620 --> 00:16:07,899
Up. No continues on easy. Right. And then up. Up.

86
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,830
It's too much. It's ADHD. It's like super ADHD.

87
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,960
I don't even remember the last thing I saw. It was a spider.

88
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,149
Why wouldn't the spider kill me?

89
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:49,620
Use the arrow keys and space bar. Does that, does that work? Holy shit it does. Wow. Thank you.

90
00:16:50,659 --> 00:17:00,169
Right. Up. And then left. Slash.

91
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:09,740
Where do I go? I'm trying. Boss fight.

92
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:28,329
Boss fight. Go. Right. Left. Up. Right. Left. Up.

93
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:46,569
Up. Left. Right. Up. Right. One hit.

94
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,740
The two second deaths are the funniest.

95
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,369
Oh shit. It's up. Down.

96
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:41,579
Which one do I go to? Which one do I go to? This is the beginning of the game.

97
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,440
It's the Homer Simpson. Okay. What if I continue? I don't want to continue from here.

98
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:22,470
Oh god damn it. All right. Well I should remember all this. No I don't.

99
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,579
I don't even feel like I'm screaming. I feel like I'm on drugs.

100
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:52,619
I make these noises during streams. That's why it's freaking me out.

101
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,980
I made that noise at the beginning of the stream. That was the first noise I made.

102
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:15,190
Yee boulders. I don't have a thing. Yee rapids.

103
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:41,380
Okay. Left. Right. Left. When the shower is too hot.

104
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:59,210
Now what? Back up here. Okay. Go. Come on. Where the fuck am I?

105
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:16,299
What? This is just the Sonic the Hedgehog room. From Sonic 3D Blast. Yeah, I played it.

106
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:37,180
What? I thought I was going to get in the face by one of those things.

107
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:59,339
Why did I just get scooped up by like an octopus? Hold on. This guy sucks.

108
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,140
This guy sucks. He's the worst. What is this guy's name? Dick Dastardly Richard.

109
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:43,670
All right. Straight. Straight. No. It's sword. Sword probably. Sword. Sword. It's sword. Sword.

110
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:55,750
Now what? Did I just get an enchantment?

111
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:10,710
I just got Dark Souls. That happens all the time.

112
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:25,880
You opened up a chest. I got a new weapon. Okay. Here we go. Got it. How many rooms are there?

113
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:28,869
Don't drink it.

114
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,400
Got it. Made it to the puke room.

115
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:55,289
This game is fucking wonderful. What a wonderful game.

116
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:14,200
Imagine doing this all in... Yeah. I can't imagine doing this all in one sitting with one quarter.

117
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:21,829
Without the guide? You know what? I'm turning the guide off. No. Wait, wait, wait. I'm turning

118
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:39,640
the guide off. I think it's time. I understand the game now. I'm going for it. Move guide off.

119
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:48,119
Move beeps. I'm going to keep move beeps on. We're going to put it on easy.

120
00:24:52,390 --> 00:25:02,410
Easy. Move guide off. I'm going for it. What does arcade cabinet mean? Hey, I'm going to do five

121
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:22,019
lives. No. This infinity continues. Five lives? It's just a border. Okay. I think that's fine.

122
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,619
I'm ready. Let's go. I'm doing it. Let's do it. I get it. I understand how the game works.

123
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:44,059
Oh, fuck. That doesn't tell me when I do them either. Okay. Let me go straight.

124
00:25:45,579 --> 00:26:00,539
Right. Now we go right. Right twice. Okay. We're going to go left. Left. Got it. What?

125
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:39,130
Uh oh. So what happened? What's going on here? What? It's not left. Go. Go. Okay. Got it. Get the

126
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:56,119
fucking mouse off the screen. Don't drink that. It's all right. Let's go. Let's do it. Continue.

127
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,200
I got infinite continues. I got infinite money. I brought right to my right is a sack of quarters.

128
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:10,809
There's like 60 bucks in the quarters over here. Forward. Forward. No, it's forward slash.

129
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:30,339
Let's forward. Forward again. Shit. No, it's slash. Forward slash. Forward slash.

130
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,339
Slash. Got it.

131
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:55,640
Just through the door. Hey, mister, can you get off me? My friends want to play. How old are you

132
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:37,369
anyway? 34. Hey, I have every right to be here just like you do. Forward. What? Slash. Left. Yep.

133
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:46,700
It's left. Flash. Forward. Good. Okay. Now we're going to go

134
00:28:50,759 --> 00:29:01,130
again. Forward. All right. Sonic the Hedgehog room. I remember this. Down. Down again.

135
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:32,869
What? That was bullshit. All right. Wait. Now go. What the fuck?

136
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,750
What? It might be left or right then.

137
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:57,000
What? It's not left. It's not down. It's not right. Which one is it? Is it jump?

138
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,839
I'm doing too early. Well, he gets killed in the animation.

139
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:16,549
I mean, the timing is here. Now. Now. See? What the fuck?

140
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:36,740
Three. Four. I, it's not down. I think it's left.

141
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:45,769
It's left. All right. I need, I gotta make something real clear. The ding,

142
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:54,980
guys, is when I'm pressing the button at the right time. You understand? Do you understand?

143
00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:28,740
Okay. Good. Left. What? No, come on. What the fuck? No. I had it. It's not, it's not the ding.

144
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,859
Hey, it's not the ding. God. Okay. I'm going to lose it forever.

145
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:49,660
Just do the ding. Dude, you have to press it when it dings.

146
00:31:50,619 --> 00:32:20,309
I'm the one creating the dings. I did it. I didn't do anything. Slash right. Now it's left.

147
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:52,539
It's right when the scene transitions. And then down. Shit. It's up. Down and up. Slashing.

148
00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:01,940
Um, wait. Now. Slash again. And then right, left. And then.

149
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:21,829
Do I lose points for fucking it up? And up. And then we have to wait. I do the thing and then here

150
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:42,569
it comes. I don't remember this one. It's the sludge. This two of these games, by the way,

151
00:33:42,569 --> 00:34:02,490
if you didn't know. It's probably left. Left. Up. And then. Right. No. Okay. I have to kill that

152
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:17,590
thing. It's immediately the right. Yeah. This wasn't the arcade. I miss this kind of shit. I

153
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:33,130
really do. No. No. So it's up slash down. I think it's probably done. This stuff,

154
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,530
this is just so goofy. This shit's so stupid. I love it.

155
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:53,460
Oh shit. And then right. But was it 50 cents? Was it a quarter? How many lives did you get?

156
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,590
Well, somebody will count how many times I've died and we can count by 50 cents.

157
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:22,949
Shit. I have to move. I miss being cheated out of my money. No. Yeah. Damn. And then.

158
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:49,019
Why does he stop pursuing me? Got it. It's forward into the pool, right? From what I remember.

159
00:35:49,019 --> 00:36:16,260
It's left. What? It is left. Oh, it's because this is different. It's mirrored. It was on

160
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:41,670
the right side last time. Okay. So you don't jump. Is it not a jump over? I've tried jumping over

161
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:58,789
twice. There's such a long line of kids behind you. Excuse me, manager. There's a guy over at

162
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:29,670
the dragon's lair machine and he smells. Out. Forward. I had it. Shit. And left. And then

163
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:38,679
forward. Yup. Forward. I just watched it happen.

164
00:37:49,139 --> 00:38:02,539
And then it's forward again. Slash. Forward. A boss fight. Oh, this is going to be hell.

165
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:20,699
This is going to be absolute hell without the guy. I think it's up.

166
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,360
No, it's left.

167
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:43,900
Oh, okay. You gotta wait. It's left and then right.

168
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,019
Sir, the arcade's closing for the day. Can you please leave?

169
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:59,210
I'll give him a handshake. And there's a hundred dollar bill in my hand.

170
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,809
I got to wait for the night. It's got to leave one of these lights on.

171
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:22,010
Left, right, it is up, I think. Left, right, up, down.

172
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:42,329
Left, right, up, down. Shit. Okay, it's left, right, left, right, up, left, left, right, up.

173
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:53,820
Right. Right, up, right.

174
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,130
And then left, left, and then down, up. It's too much.

175
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,969
Oh my god. I can't. All right, I got it. I got it. I'll be good.

176
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,210
Left, right, up.

177
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,630
Oh, it's up.

178
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,630
I just pressed right. You got this little window to do it. God damn it.

179
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:07,480
Oh my god, you can't spam it. Somebody said spam the directions. You can't.

180
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:28,170
Kill him. I'm good.

181
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:47,590
It's right. I think it's back.

182
00:41:47,590 --> 00:42:11,750
Oh, that's not left. How is it not left? You have to jump over, right?

183
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:19,940
Too early? I can't just jump in there?

184
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:28,039
Okay, it's down. I thought I tried down.

185
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:55,559
What the fuck? I, okay, I remember this part. Go forward. I remember this room. Oh, this is bad.

186
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:11,380
Shit, I had it too. Oh well.

187
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:29,530
You gotta watch the fire comes up. Did I do it? I did it. All right, new content.

188
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:43,420
Oh, you asshole. It's right. How am I up here? Wait, how did I get back to this room?

189
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:55,139
Is it the elevator? It just goes in a random order. Oh, okay.

190
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:16,820
Get out. Okay, then now we're down the elevator again. Forward.

191
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:44,340
I just tried to go up. It's up. I, I'm, ah.

192
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,659
Somebody count. I want to know how much money I've spent here.

193
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:18,869
I, oh no, not this shit. I have to, oh my god, this is gonna be hell. This is gonna be horrible.

194
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:35,139
Remember, this was like slash, run, run, run, slash. Left.

195
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,639
So it's mirrored from last time. So it's left. It's, I think it's left over and over again.

196
00:45:48,809 --> 00:46:08,760
Left again. Huh? What?

197
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:41,349
God, I didn't even have a chance to see where the sword was going. Right again. And then left.

198
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:06,579
Right again. Right. Okay, then it's right again. And then it's right. Left. Right. Right.

199
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:18,389
Right. Grab. Swing. Holy shit. There was a left and a right in there, guys, and I fucking

200
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:34,179
guessed wildly and I got it. That was not just space. That was left and. I have to do this shit

201
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:40,840
again. Just on the other, it's a mirror against the screen. Does the game end? I don't know if

202
00:47:40,840 --> 00:48:02,940
the game ever ends. And then it's right. I don't know how to use the elevator.

203
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:15,179
I, where am I supposed to be going in the elevator? Is it, is it not left or right?

204
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:41,030
It should be right. Isn't it just mirrored? Maybe it's forward. I've tried up, left and right on the

205
00:48:41,030 --> 00:49:02,360
envelope. What the fuck? It'll punish you for doing things too early. That's the only frames I have

206
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:23,639
there. Watch, ready? Maybe wait till it gets up. Oh, all right. And then, oh yeah, okay, the statue.

207
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:41,880
Now what? These guys died so many times. It's, okay, it's slash and then right up the stairs.

208
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:47,670
Right now? What? No, it's up to the axe.

209
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:05,369
Shit. Okay, it's up and then right. I thought it was up and then slash.

210
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:25,500
And then in. Oh shit, no, it's down. You have to go all the way around and then up the stairs.

211
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:48,820
And then over. Go, hurry up, go. What are you doing? Press this. So on the stairs,

212
00:50:48,820 --> 00:51:10,280
why do I have to jump to the left? Because it's not slash. I don't remember. And then up and then

213
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:31,929
go left. Yep, and then up and then up. Okay, good. Oh shit, I have to fight. All right,

214
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:42,599
I gotta fight him. Slash and I think it's run. Got it, go. Up, again, okay. Now,

215
00:51:42,599 --> 00:52:00,300
I think it's another elevator. See? Up. Okay, so it's two ups. Three ups.

216
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:27,320
We should go right. Landing yet. He wasn't even done landing. Dude, so it's a double tap. You're

217
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:53,480
gonna go up, up. And then again, it's bats. Slash or maybe duck, I wonder. And it's probably slash.

218
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:08,039
The bats coming. Yep, slash, right, right again. Go. Bats, right, slash, left. It's probably

219
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:29,800
slash. It's slash. And then it's left. And then we go. What is that? What's? Oh, god damn it.

220
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:38,059
So that's also a slash. Or it might be a, you might have to run back up the stairs.

221
00:53:38,059 --> 00:54:06,710
Jump, slash, left. Got it. Oh boy, here we go. I have no idea what happened. I'm gonna say jump

222
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:38,780
or slash. Probably forward, right? Or right? I don't know when to do this. So it's definitely

223
00:54:38,780 --> 00:55:00,519
slash when I turn around. So that doesn't work. So try the swing. Maybe try swinging twice before

224
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:18,059
it falls? We'll probably jump. Oh, come on. That window is so tiny.

225
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:34,460
I probably have to run down or right after the sword.

226
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:42,539
No, it's not down.

227
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,719
Too early. They, when it goes, that's your, that's where they kill you.

228
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:22,900
So, swing twice? Because you get surrounded. How the fuck do I get away from that?

229
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:44,539
Jump. What the fuck? Forward, I, it's up. It's up. I have to go. So when they get in front of you,

230
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:59,460
you go up and then up again? Or do I go down? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

231
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,539
When they get in front of you, you go up and then up again? Or left? Oh god, this is gonna be fucking

232
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:26,469
horrible. The new cuphead looks hard. Maybe it's left. Yeah, it looks left.

233
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:46,789
Damn it. Did I beat cuphead? Yeah, I did. I beat that like the first day it came out.

234
00:57:47,349 --> 00:58:03,210
Damn. Where do I go? I just want to, I want to screenshot that area.

235
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:29,849
Is it, I, I tried right. I tried left. Maybe I should try down.

236
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:50,340
Down doesn't do anything. It looks like left is the waterfall, but then I go in the waterfall and

237
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:59,269
it kills me. So I'm not, I need to know where to go and the right exact moment to press the button.

238
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:17,300
Nope. Too bad I don't have a sword. The sword doesn't work.

239
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:31,619
All right, up. Okay. It's up again. It's right. It's left. Holy shit. Okay, my god. It's up,

240
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:47,239
it's right, and then it's left. But you have to do it at the exact moment. No.

241
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,880
Is it up again? I think it might be up again. It's not left. Oh my god, this place sucks.

242
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:12,420
It's up and I, why is that?

243
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,610
Oh, come on. I swung.

244
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:44,070
I'm probably so close to the end. I have to beat it. I just pressed it. I just pressed it.

245
01:00:44,070 --> 01:01:00,789
Oh my god. Do I have to wait another like tenth of a second before I can press it?

246
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:19,449
Oh my, no, that's it. I didn't press anything. He just died. I gotta go earlier than that.

247
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:29,860
Yeah, it's earlier than that. And then up and then left. I don't fucking know.

248
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:58,170
No. I'm gonna wait. Maybe it's up again. No, but wouldn't up just go right into the lava?

249
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:12,039
I feel like that would just jump in the lava.

250
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:35,500
Got it. Come on. Again. It's again. Okay. No, I don't know what it would have meant.

251
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:46,389
Is it swing? It's definitely not swing because I can't kill them.

252
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:09,260
Up again. It's up again. I did it. Oh no, what am I doing in the elevator? What am I doing in

253
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:20,059
the elevator? So stop what? Stop like. What's the elevator tactic? Wait for two. Wait for one.

254
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:38,760
One, two. I'm just going with two. No, no, no, I don't want to. What the fuck?

255
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:57,690
What to do? Oh, this is new.

256
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:15,159
Okay, this is he boulders. Now you have to dodge the boulders. You gotta do it much quicker than

257
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:45,849
that. This is a long string too. Rapids. This is fucking bad. I'm gonna fucking start this

258
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:52,630
section over like 25 times, I think, man. Because that first one was up.

259
01:04:52,630 --> 01:05:15,559
Up and then left. Left. Up. Left. Okay. Okay, whirlwinds. This is right. Just gotta avoid

260
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:29,420
the whirlwinds. Fuck, I must have screwed it up. All right, that's it. Oh, I forgot to grab the

261
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:58,150
chain. All right, I'm good. Now what? I think I have to duck or go to the right. No, right is

262
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:20,539
spikes. Left. You have to dodge right. It says right. It's left. Whatever the fuck it is.

263
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:33,590
You gotta do really early for that third one.

264
01:06:55,289 --> 01:07:05,909
First try at that one. All right, save me. I'm going. Did I grab the diamond?

265
01:07:09,769 --> 01:07:22,699
This is a new room. All right, slash twice. Yep. It's slash, slash it.

266
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:38,139
Shit, then it's up. How am I keeping up with what's happening? Well, the answer is no.

267
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:47,639
I know that wasn't a yes or no question, but it was. Kind of. Now what?

268
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:58,820
Hmm. Into the hole. Slash the hole. Watch out.

269
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:28,149
And get out. Nice. No, not this again. Twice and then right. Slash the spider. Get in. Okay.

270
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:43,739
Yep. It was up and I fucked it up.

271
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:13,560
Oh my god. I hate this room because I know what it is, but it's flipped. I memorized it from last

272
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:43,979
time. I did it. I pressed it. I pressed up. Fucking 30 rocks down. I did.

273
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:57,369
What?

274
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:51,369
Fuck you. I made it to throne room. Okay, right up. Sir, we just got a notification

275
01:10:51,369 --> 01:11:01,579
that you just took out $100,000 to beat Dragon's Lair. Well, it's all right. I'm going to be able

276
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:17,430
to pay that back because this shit ain't going to take more than $75. Right. What was that?

277
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:35,720
Did you hear that noise? I beat it. It's the end. The dragon. Swing.

278
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:48,550
I think it's swing.

279
01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:06,170
Am I doing that to the dragon? I'll do right instead.

280
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:12,520
No. I tried left. I tried up.

281
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:26,500
Maybe down. I'm trying to make, no, no, I don't want to swing. It's not up.

282
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:43,180
It's not left. It's not up. I'm going to try down. It's not down. It is left. What? I pressed left

283
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:59,510
so many times. What the fuck? Okay. Ready? Left. Left. What the? What? I did that like three times.

284
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:33,989
We killed us both. Left and then up. I don't know. He's back. He went back to sleep.

285
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:40,250
Did I break the glass?

286
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:47,449
Save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

287
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:51,609
This is freaking me out. To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

288
01:13:52,810 --> 01:14:02,739
Please tell me I can start from there. Oh, fuck me.

289
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:11,930
I think I have to, I don't know where to go.

290
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:23,979
Okay. It's so tall. Then watch out for the thing, the plates that fall.

291
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:36,779
And it's the over-animated, scary faces. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps

292
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:40,699
it around his neck. I wonder if it's down. I think it's probably down. To slay the dragon,

293
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:50,149
use the magic sword. I'm going to try down because where do I go? Down. It's down. It's down.

294
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:58,899
Left. I don't know. Right. Down. I don't know. It's down again.

295
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:04,180
Oh, fuck.

296
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,729
Tell me about how to kill the dragon again.

297
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:28,170
This was video gaming at one point. Oh yeah. I know everybody loved it.

298
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:37,260
Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

299
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,659
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

300
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,569
It's down. Right here. And then it's left.

301
01:15:53,449 --> 01:16:13,659
It's not. It's down again. Yep. And then. I don't know. It's probably up. It's either up or right.

302
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,100
Yeah, it's funny. Look, these things happen in a tenth of a second.

303
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:28,229
Look, you know how much money people used to spend on this shit? I used to go into

304
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:32,710
arcades back in the fucking early nineties and the screen would be broken. And I would

305
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,829
always go up to the machine and be like, I want to try that. Why is the, the, the monitor,

306
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:59,619
the screen is broken. It's because somebody like, I, okay, I got it. I'll get it this time.

307
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:06,140
It's down. Hey, you guys ready for that monologue again?

308
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:18,359
Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

309
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:22,760
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

310
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:31,180
I don't, I still don't have that memorized. It's down twice. And then it's right.

311
01:17:31,420 --> 01:18:03,479
Now what? No, it was too fast. I tried to swing. I tried to swing too early. I just figured.

312
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:19,939
God, whatever. Dirk definitely Richard. He saved me. The cage is locked with the key.

313
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:28,060
The dragon keeps it around his neck. To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

314
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:32,460
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

315
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,010
Okay.

316
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,520
Again.

317
01:18:48,380 --> 01:19:05,210
I did, I did, he just dies. He just dies. There's no that. I didn't, he just dies.

318
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:10,569
She just dies. I have to go left or down or something. I have to grab it and jump backwards.

319
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:25,500
I, I think you grab the sword and hit down. I'm so close. It's down. It has to be.

320
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:41,130
Why am I looking? I'm literally reading chat right now. On a game you have a tenth of a second to press a button.

321
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:43,130
What the fuck am I thinking?

322
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:06,619
Please save me. Stop making me read the chat with your funny copy plaster.

323
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:15,960
He saved me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

324
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,359
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

325
01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:27,619
I think I'm gonna try down. I'm gonna grab sword and then press down.

326
01:20:28,579 --> 01:21:03,109
Should I just not press anything? Maybe I just shouldn't press any buttons. I don't know.

327
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:17,130
If I don't press a button, does it just do it? I don't have to swing the sword. But do I? I have no idea.

328
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:37,449
Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

329
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:41,850
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

330
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:55,659
All right, I'll get it this time. I'm not gonna press anything.

331
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:10,619
Here we go. Don't touch anything. I'm dead.

332
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:20,359
That's all you guys saying. I was doing it too early. I didn't press any buttons at all.

333
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:35,340
So maybe I have to press it right when I touch it. Don't go for the sword. What?

334
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:47,640
I know I've pressed the sword button. You got like this. There's only one window where you

335
01:22:47,640 --> 01:23:00,550
can press this button and it's like seven frames, six frames long. Maybe even less than that.

336
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:28,630
I fucking pressed it. This game is 60 in FPS. Yeah, so it's even smaller than what you think.

337
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,430
It's like two. It's one frame per. It's one or two frames.

338
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:38,819
I'm gonna try to grab. I'm gonna try to hit the sword right when I go up to grab the sword.

339
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:46,020
Let's see if that does it like right. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around

340
01:23:46,020 --> 01:24:02,439
his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword. Did I press it? I'm gonna go for right when I grab

341
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:20,180
the sword right when I touch it. Space. I'm like going in space. Here we go. There's no that. No,

342
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:24,819
there is no inputs. There are no inputs. That's wrong. I'm not going for the sword. I'm not gonna

343
01:24:24,819 --> 01:24:31,449
grab it. There are no inputs. You can't do an input there. No inputs. There's no inputs.

344
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:52,489
I'm not gonna touch the sword. But what the fuck do I do? He saved me. The cage is locked

345
01:24:52,489 --> 01:25:00,569
with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword.

346
01:25:01,289 --> 01:25:05,289
There isn't any room for me to grab the sword. Otherwise, the error sounds in play. Yeah,

347
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:10,810
that's what I mean. So it's something before you grab the sword. Maybe space bright or like the

348
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:15,210
different input or button press or another input or button press. I just said the same thing twice.

349
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:20,170
Holy shit. My brain just went backwards. I rewound. I'll fall a second. My brain.

350
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:34,739
Wow. The stream skipped. No, it was me.

351
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:45,560
So should I press space right before that transition to get the sword or should I hit

352
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,960
like a different right or down or left? I don't know. He saved me. The cage is locked

353
01:25:51,960 --> 01:26:00,039
with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword.

354
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:10,090
All right, let's see what happens. I'm gonna try to do sword right before I go grab it.

355
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:39,159
There we go. Did it. I did it. Now what? I don't know. It's sword twice.

356
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,439
It's sword and then sword to block and then god if I know.

357
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:58,460
So it's sword right before you touch it. Sword again to block and then I have to move.

358
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:20,460
He saved me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.

359
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,420
It's up after. Somebody said left and somebody said up. I don't know what to believe.

360
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:27,770
I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try up.

361
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:58,279
Left Jeremy. You're all saying different shit. Okay. Left. Right.

362
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:17,060
I don't know. It's more. It's left and then I have no idea. Left and then up maybe.

363
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:36,550
I did left and then right and it's wrong. He saved me. The cage is locked with the key.

364
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:42,869
The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. He spent all your allowance on this shit.

365
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:50,710
Magic sword. Yeah I'm happy I did. No guides by the way. I don't need guides.

366
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:13,380
Again. This is it. Left.

367
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:37,770
It's space. Oh I did it. What do I do? Grab it. Up. Don't touch anything. What? Did she

368
01:29:37,770 --> 01:30:01,939
say? I said I would. That's it. That's the end of the game. I win. Watch the.

369
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:09,819
The next draw we're going to do has two characters in it and the two. I get to draw Dirk.

370
01:30:09,819 --> 01:30:16,460
And the dragon singe. Now Dirk is a little tiny character and dragon is a big character. Okay.

371
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:20,460
So what I'm going to do to cheat this a little bit is I'll pull Dirk into the foreground so

372
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:27,020
that he stays kind of big and push the dragon to the background. And I think just to get this

373
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:34,859
thing to work I'm going to sketch out how I can do this. This dragon is sort of working with Dirk

374
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:46,100
like that and I can bring all the tail up around like this. I have to concentrate while I draw.

375
01:30:46,100 --> 01:31:00,819
Sorry. So the dragon. What I just told you I think is really relevant here. What's the dragon doing?

376
01:31:00,819 --> 01:31:14,779
Is he excited? Is he angry? Does he. Oh that's probably like a 40 minute video.

377
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:19,100
I don't want to. Why did I skip that? Because that's probably that's going to that's like a

378
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:30,180
28 minute video. I was watching that. Well let's go look go look up draw dick on oh draw Dirk on

379
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:48,619
YouTube. All right that's that one. We're just getting started. I got dragon's lair two. I've

380
01:31:48,619 --> 01:31:52,779
also got space ace. I've also let's let's do let's get away from dragon's lair. Let's try this one.

381
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:56,779
Now this one is really old and has not been remastered.

382
01:31:57,579 --> 01:32:09,560
So it looks like dog shit. So we're gonna try this one. I hope it opens. I don't this doesn't

383
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:19,829
even have a thing on steam I don't think. I don't know if I'm gonna beat this one. I really doubt

384
01:32:19,829 --> 01:32:32,979
that I'm going to because it's so crunchy. It's kingdom the far reaches. This is a crunchy fucking

385
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:52,840
game. So let me get this right. It should. Okay hopefully this fucking opens. Oh god I can't even

386
01:32:52,840 --> 01:33:05,420
fucking see. All right hold on hold on hold on. No that's my that's a command prompt. There it is.

387
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:18,359
There it is. Oh yeah it didn't even take me five seconds. I got it. I got it immediately.

388
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:32,149
It was ready to go. Let's do it. You can still see right? Everyone can see perfectly fine.

389
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:45,859
This is a crusty fucking game. Just need to be very aware of that. Virtual image productions

390
01:33:45,859 --> 01:33:54,979
presents the far reaches. Kingdom the far reaches. Start apprentice start wizard.

391
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,819
I think this is difficulties. I don't know if I want to do start as a wizard.

392
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:39,659
Wizard. No I ain't doing that. The history. The he-man. The time of the arched kings is

393
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:45,399
past. You my old friend are the last of your races. This is fucking crunchy. Farewell.

394
01:34:46,119 --> 01:35:06,500
All right so that's an evil wizard. There is one in time destroyed. What was that?

395
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,500
Oh shit man. He like burped out his true form for a second.

396
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:19,800
So the high race of the arched kings passed from the world destroyed by twisted.

397
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:35,399
The wisest and most powerful was our leader Morbus. This amulet is called the hand.

398
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:40,920
That's a huge fucking amulet. The most powerful magic could be focused.

399
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,439
Grandpa are you sure you didn't just spray paint a hubcap fucking gold.

400
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:51,859
Creating the five relics from the amulet. It's a piece of pineapple.

401
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,939
The last of the bloodline of the arched kings would come to challenge the might of torlok.

402
01:36:01,609 --> 01:36:09,539
Morbus is gone but the one who will come remains. I am ready. Torlok is searching for

403
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:19,460
the relics and for you. His power grows while the old magic fades. Try me. I will find the

404
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:25,460
relics and rejoin them to make the hand of Morbus. I have tried 22 apprentices over the years and

405
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:31,539
they have all died but they were not of the race of the arched kings. That's that's that's

406
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:38,380
that means you're a bad teacher right? You've had 22 apprentices and they've all died.

407
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,420
I think that that's on you. That means you're not doing good enough like magicians teaching.

408
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:51,850
All right I'm gonna turn it up. Somebody said it's not loud enough. That should be good.

409
01:36:52,729 --> 01:37:00,010
All right I'm gonna I'm not starting as a wizard. You guys serious? That's not gonna happen.

410
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:17,350
I'm doing apprentice. Have you already seen this? I just did that. It was me.

411
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:25,979
By the way this is a DVD game. You could I was actually gonna put this on a tv and play it.

412
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:36,100
Game on. What's wrong? Lathan a terrible thing has happened.

413
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:44,979
Drake's blood the wicked has imprisoned the rightful ruler and claimed the throne. You must find the

414
01:37:44,979 --> 01:37:50,659
relics, the black mace, the hunting horn, and the orb of Morbus to defeat Drake's blood.

415
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:56,819
Hurry to my mansion. I am preparing scrolls to help you on your journey. The kingdoms are

416
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:05,500
counting on you. This reminds me of like that old bible animation. Last hope to find the relics of

417
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:13,979
Morbus and renew the magic that grows old as I do. But until you hold the relics be cautious

418
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:23,260
in your use of magic. I understand Daylon. I have finished new scrolls for you. Scrolls? I give you

419
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:29,979
three scrolls inscribed with spells of seeing. They bring sight to the blind and show those with

420
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:38,220
vision that which is hidden. Okay you got me a backpack with three magical scrolls. Now which

421
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:46,869
scrolls should I work on next? Which scrolls should you work on? Spell of understanding, spell of

422
01:38:46,869 --> 01:39:06,649
release, spell of traveling. Spell of release? Now choose which of Glendale where once you lived

423
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:12,090
the haunted waterfalls or the eldritch forest. I mean the haunted waterfalls is absolutely

424
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,050
haunted waterfalls.

425
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:31,659
I have no idea what the fuck any of these people just said. I what did you say?

426
01:39:33,939 --> 01:39:55,670
Uh scroll of seeing. Uh okay I don't. Lathan, tree folk forest,

01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,060
tree lower pool. Okay let's go to lower pools.

428
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:24,920
Continue your quest and I will have your spells ready soon. I didn't think you'd be back this soon.

429
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:34,300
I haven't had time. I just put it in the oven. You're gonna come back in 15 minutes.

430
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:39,829
Um what the fuck do you want me to do now? What? Where the fuck am I?

431
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:48,069
Can I choose a different part of the map? Bogs on the moors. I can't see a thing not even my feet.

432
01:40:51,449 --> 01:41:04,090
This guy sucks. What? Jesus. Welcome back Lathan. I have finished new scrolls for you.

433
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:10,010
Here are three scrolls inscribed with spells of release. This guy can't even walk correctly.

434
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:20,979
And accelerate that which should not be bound together. Okay. Now which scrolls should I work

435
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:27,319
on next? Which scrolls should you work on next? Okay so I have scroll of release. Didn't those

436
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:36,409
people in the water say release? Spell of traveling. Now choose where in the kingdom of

437
01:41:36,409 --> 01:41:42,010
Wyver wish to go. Let's go do it. The village of Glendale where once you lived. The haunted

438
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:48,010
waterfalls or the eldritch forest. Haunted waterfalls. I have I got the spell of release.

439
01:41:52,409 --> 01:42:09,850
Chocolate milk. Where's my spell? Release us? That's the one right there. How the fuck do I use it?

440
01:42:10,649 --> 01:42:46,949
Press the help. That's not gonna help me. No go. Didn't they say release us?

441
01:42:51,529 --> 01:42:54,569
Spell of release. So how do I just like can I like cast it?

442
01:42:55,609 --> 01:43:13,380
Click it. Right click. Left click. It just closes it. Okay bye. Press three. No I don't want to.

443
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:28,949
Don't go to the lower pools. The tree folk forest. You are the wood elves? The people of the forest?

444
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:34,789
Yes and we know of your quest. Mobus was our friend and we offer you the help of the wood elf

445
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:42,409
staff. Well let me let me get it. Wait is this a trick? This is a trick isn't it?

446
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:50,460
Take the staff to the fairy circle in the forest and give it to the fairies.

447
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:09,739
Take it to the fairy circle in the forest. Forester's camp guild hall center of Glen

448
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:15,659
foresters. This is forester's camp right? That's the middle of the forest.

449
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:37,779
Go away. Strangers aren't welcome. I can't click the link. I can't alt tab out of the game otherwise it'll break.

450
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:45,020
Fairy circle.

451
01:44:53,130 --> 01:45:04,100
Strength left. What? I've heard that kind of singing before. The fairies must be here.

452
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:11,560
Okay wait wait. Spell of the wood elf staff. Spell of release. Spell of seeing.

453
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:14,039
Wood elf staff.

454
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:30,710
Seeing first. I see them. What strange little fellows. Okay here's your staff.

455
01:45:37,369 --> 01:45:42,250
You have returned that which can shield us from torlog. Therefore we now show you

456
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:49,449
the castle of crystal. Goodbye friend. Goodbye. Be sure to try our delicious cookies.

457
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:55,479
The one with the fudge in the middle is my favorite. Crystal castle. I can just go to it.

458
01:45:56,199 --> 01:46:17,930
Spell of release. I'm holding them in my hands. I'm holding the spells in my hands.

459
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:25,739
What? No what? Crystal chivers.

460
01:46:28,699 --> 01:46:37,109
So I'm not actually a wizard. Okay so that just keeps me alive. I can't go in the door.

461
01:46:37,989 --> 01:47:13,510
Foresters camp. Wait zoom out. This game's not that big is it? I can't go anywhere else besides

462
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:21,619
like the one area that I am. Well then let me go to the tree. Let me go back to the foresters camp.

463
01:47:21,619 --> 01:47:31,430
This guy just yells at me. What? You again? I told you to go away. Well what are you gonna do?

464
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:48,859
Okay center of glendo. Leave Wygaard Nathan. The guild lords are tools of the plague magician who

465
01:47:48,859 --> 01:47:56,579
is Torlog's ally. Flee across the marsh wastes and into isles. Flee across the marsh wastes into

466
01:47:58,579 --> 01:48:07,180
subtitles. Do you really think that a game that came out like 32 years ago is gonna have subtitles

467
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:32,039
in the options? A blind beggar. Spell of seeing. You healed me. When the town hears of your powers

468
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:36,119
the guild lords will have to give you safe passes to the haunted waterfall.

469
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:41,560
So the guild I got to go to the guild hall.

470
01:48:48,229 --> 01:49:07,930
Go to the guild hall. This is an instant death screen. Ancient runes. I wonder how I can understand

471
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:32,600
them. Scroll of seeing. I need the scroll of understanding. So I can let me go back to the

472
01:49:32,600 --> 01:50:11,109
magician then. Path. Skip. Skip. Skip it. Now which scrolls should I work on next?

473
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:20,869
I want you to work on scroll of understanding. I'll choose. It's too crusty. Is it too crusty?

474
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:26,789
The village of glendo. Just wait. Or once you lived the haunted waterfalls or the eldritch forest.

475
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:35,270
All right I need to go to the forest. Thank you. Give me the staff. I have the people of the

476
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:56,710
forest? Yes. Give me that. Take the staff. All right. Later. Your eye don't like you.

477
01:50:58,710 --> 01:51:09,529
Very certain. There it is. Let's get the. I don't understand what this does.

478
01:51:10,729 --> 01:51:15,770
This doesn't kill me. I just smell something and it makes me feel bad. I have no strength left.

479
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:19,689
Okay. Cool. Here's your staff.

480
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:31,590
Now I see them. What strange little fellows.

481
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,670
Your health is the tree branch at the top of the.

482
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:40,470
Okay. That's. That could be the worst health bar I've ever seen in my whole life.

483
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:52,979
You have returned that which. All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Quest complete. Now I've got the

484
01:51:52,979 --> 01:52:06,170
crystal castle opened. Let's go with them. All right. You went into the kill this time.

485
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:18,729
You didn't kill me last time. Have returned. The new scrolls are complete. These scrolls of

486
01:52:18,729 --> 01:52:24,090
understanding give you knowledge of ancient alphabets and unfamiliar tongues. Use them

487
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:35,260
when you encounter these barriers. Thanks. Now which scrolls should I work on next?

488
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:43,109
All right. So now I want to go to that rock. Spell of travel. I'll choose where in the kingdom

489
01:52:43,109 --> 01:52:48,840
of why I wish to go. Where the hell was that? Village of Glendale. Once you lived the haunted

490
01:52:48,840 --> 01:53:01,340
waterfalls. The scrolls of next game. Leave why God Nathan. The guild lords are tools of the

491
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:13,029
play magician. It's pretty good. All right. Let's go get the. There's the guilt. Wait, wait, wait.

492
01:53:13,029 --> 01:53:20,729
Okay. Hold on. Out spirits of Glendale. The cure of the blind. The blindness. Go to the

493
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:32,569
guild hall. Blind beggar. You healed me when the town hears of your powers. The guild lords will

494
01:53:32,649 --> 01:53:39,260
have to give you safe passes to the haunted waterfall. It is the law. Thank you.

495
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:47,500
Back up to center of Glendale and then to the guild hall.

496
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:57,960
Nathan, we're so proud of you. Everyone in Glendale has heard about how you healed the blind beggar.

497
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:06,090
Even the guild lords are impressed, Nathan. Why would that make you concerned? Oh dear,

498
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:16,619
that's not good. Guild hall. Healers belong at the waterfall. But I'm guard Stakeham. What?

499
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:35,289
Okay, does anybody have any idea what just happened? The guild hall has even heard about

500
01:54:35,289 --> 01:54:40,810
your beautiful efforts and they really like you. Okay, go to guild hall. Yeah, don't let him in.

501
01:54:41,609 --> 01:54:48,649
Get, seize him and send him to the pool of knowledge. I don't get it. Seize him.

502
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:54,100
That's usually something that happens when something bad happens to you afterwards.

503
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:02,409
Is this going to kill me?

504
01:55:15,899 --> 01:55:25,500
All right, kids, I'm sorry. I got nothing for you. I got to go back down to where that scroll was.

505
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:30,460
No, I'm going to breathe in the fucking like fart gas. Can you tell me anything more?

506
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:37,260
Apprentice, the plague magician knows of your quest and he is waiting in the forest for you.

507
01:55:38,539 --> 01:55:45,850
What are you talking about? I thought I, center of Glendale, I'm going down

508
01:55:50,340 --> 01:56:01,430
and it's outskirts and then it's the scroll of understanding I can do down here. Friend,

509
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:08,569
can you help me? I, I have heard stories about relic hidden in the forest in the castle of

510
01:56:08,569 --> 01:56:14,569
crystal. I've also heard that fairies guard the path. Now go Lathan, this place is not safe for you.

511
01:56:16,409 --> 01:56:19,609
This what place? Why is everybody not, why does everybody hate me?

512
01:56:20,409 --> 01:56:31,340
Barren rocks. There it is. Scroll of understanding. Ancient runes. I wonder how I can understand them.

513
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:39,590
Scroll of understanding. In the black keep are the runes of Iscar which hold the power of law in

514
01:56:39,590 --> 01:57:06,890
that kingdom. That literally did not even help me at all. Okay, so might as well see who this is.

515
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:38,979
I'm going to be honest. Good, you have returned. If there's that much voltage going through that

516
01:57:38,979 --> 01:57:45,060
crystal, that shit's going to be humming. With them, you can go anywhere. If there's 600,000

517
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:48,579
volts going through that thing, you're going to, you'll hear that from fucking 50 feet away.

518
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:55,899
You ain't going to touch that. Now, which scrolls should I work on next?

519
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:02,810
Why don't you work on the spell of release? I'll choose where it is.

520
01:58:06,949 --> 01:58:13,350
Where once you lived, the haunted forest or the eldritch forest. The amps kill you, not the volts.

521
01:58:15,909 --> 01:58:24,939
I'm sorry, I'm not an electrician. I have the spell of release, so why shouldn't I go to waterfall?

522
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:42,680
Release the spell of rest. You must use your magic to release us from our spell of traveling.

523
01:58:43,640 --> 01:59:05,539
That's a skull. Black keep? Sea dwellers' pavilion? The high ground. Just go into the palace.

524
01:59:05,539 --> 01:59:10,260
Just teleport. Wait, does teleport into the boss's room, the throne room behind him and like bash his

525
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:31,319
head with a rock? This is Drake's Blood's palace, you know, and his wizards won't like your coming

526
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:39,100
here. They get very jealous. How do you know I'm a wizard? Ha! House travels in these hard times.

527
01:59:44,119 --> 01:59:46,039
What? What do you mean, who else trapped?

528
01:59:48,840 --> 02:00:01,020
Hard core, yourself? I played for Grace Delight, the true ruler of Iscar, until Drake's Blood

529
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:07,180
imprisoned her in the North Tower and claimed the throne. He was corrupted by Torlok, as are many

530
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:28,699
here. Which door way? I'm gonna go up and through this door. Look at that posture pog.

531
02:00:29,979 --> 02:00:36,300
I found him! I found him! You're another wizard looking for the relics. Well, you may find a way

532
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:41,659
to Alcatesh if you can make the tapestry of seeing in the south chamber reveal its secret.

533
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:53,500
Why are they letting me just walk around the castle? Where are the guards? We're just eating dinner.

534
02:00:53,500 --> 02:01:01,369
That's a good air. It looks like it's been a while since good was done around here.

535
02:01:01,369 --> 02:01:05,770
Oh, I bet you've come like the others to slay the king.

536
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:19,819
Rock! Um, so, this is mocking me because I'm here to kill the king.

537
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:25,579
Right, so why am I not, why am I allowed to just walk around? Okay, what about this doorway?

538
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:29,899
I can't do anything else here. Door, we'll go up here.

539
02:01:30,859 --> 02:01:36,420
Oh, sure. Hello, um, I, uh, well, I... You're another wizard looking for the relics.

540
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:42,180
Well, you may find a way to Alcatesh if you can make the tapestry of seeing in the south...

541
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:49,979
Get out of here. Oh, hello, I, um, well, I, I, I, I don't know.

542
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:55,159
Look, the wizard's back. Who are the others you mentioned before?

543
02:01:56,039 --> 02:02:00,039
Apprentices of daylight. They live in the palace now.

544
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:11,899
Oh no, I went into the time room. You just have this unguarded?

545
02:02:12,859 --> 02:02:19,689
This is just an open doorway into like a fucking portal. Um, I don't know.

546
02:02:19,689 --> 02:02:33,369
Hello? Wait, why am I here? Where's the wizard?

547
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:40,970
He's dead. I need more help. The rightful ruler of Iscar can help you, Lathan.

548
02:02:41,689 --> 02:03:08,630
He died. That was his force ghost. Keep going. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Out.

549
02:03:10,630 --> 02:03:24,010
Get on the high ground. Lathan, be cautious. Bandits who will steal everything you carry

550
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:27,529
roam the rocky desert. Leave me the fuck alone.

551
02:03:28,489 --> 02:03:39,960
Shimmering oasis. Dunes people campsite. Temple of Syndra.

552
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:50,229
Shimmering oasis. That's going to be healing, I think.

553
02:03:56,729 --> 02:04:01,350
Pool. What do you mean pool? There's no pool here.

554
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:15,260
There's no, there's no, there's no pool. That's not a pool. This is a mirage. That's sand.

555
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:25,909
A drink from the sand. That'll, I'm gonna die.

556
02:04:32,569 --> 02:04:42,489
Who is, who is, Electra.

557
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:14,199
One more. This is the third attempt. Last try. This time, last try, this is it.

558
02:05:16,039 --> 02:05:19,159
This time I'm going to start with the scroll of traveling because that's the best one.

559
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:38,439
Now choose where in the game. Let's go to, I just want to see.

560
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:43,800
A troublemaker if I ever saw one. But I'm. Dodge, take him.

561
02:05:57,239 --> 02:06:03,260
I got instantly eaten by rats. And I will have your spells ready soon.

562
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:12,779
Oh, come on. Please. I just want the scroll. Let's go to the marsh wastes. What? Is this

563
02:06:12,779 --> 02:06:20,170
an instant kill screen? The marsh wastes. What a dreary place. I can hardly see where to step.

564
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:22,970
Yeah, this is a, this is a, spell of seeing.

565
02:06:34,619 --> 02:06:39,270
Wise. Wise? Wise.

566
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:56,680
Uh, nothing I can do on this screen. Okay, we're back at the shimmering oasis. Don't touch that.

567
02:06:57,640 --> 02:07:09,319
Uh, how about the dunes people campsite? Do you know anything about magic about the relics?

568
02:07:09,319 --> 02:07:15,079
Our legend says that the relics of Mobus can free the kingdoms from the shadow of evil.

569
02:07:15,079 --> 02:07:22,970
But that is an ancient story. Okay, well, thanks. I guess.

570
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:33,350
Um, lost mines, mountain cliffs. That's a, well, that's a fall down and I scream. Let's go to the

571
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:46,340
lost mines. I advise you to seek out the Amazons of the oasis and they will help if you can prove

572
02:07:46,340 --> 02:08:00,100
yourself worthy. Thank you. The different guy. Was that a different force of ghost? How many

573
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:16,140
force ghost Obi-Wans do I know? Holy shit, we made it.

574
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:27,829
There's an explosion sound too. I knew it. I.

575
02:08:32,489 --> 02:08:38,729
Lathan, be cautious. Bandits who will steal everything you carry roam the rocky desert.

576
02:08:38,729 --> 02:08:55,899
Desert oasis. Okay. Welcome. Since Torlok drove us from our home in the west, we have not trusted

577
02:08:55,899 --> 02:09:03,770
your kind, but perhaps you are the one our legends speak of. Farewell. What do you mean farewell?

578
02:09:04,569 --> 02:09:10,550
Perhaps you're the one that the legend speaks of. Bye. Get out of here.

579
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:18,659
Leave. All right. Well, we have to go into the temple then temple of syndrome.

580
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:43,319
Let's go. Stranger. Not all of us are under Torlok's influence. Look hard.

581
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:58,789
There is knowledge hidden here. All right. This doorway looks scary. This one looks safe.

582
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:11,369
You have to go to the one that looks scary, I think. For the blood sword of the Argent

583
02:10:11,449 --> 02:10:19,020
Kings. Look in the black key. Black key for the sword.

584
02:10:25,319 --> 02:11:00,300
Stranger. I feel like we missed a whole lot before that happened. To me, that seems like we should

585
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:05,579
have gotten at least to the middle point there where I was sacrificed to a giant demon.

586
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:21,909
Wizard mode. All right, with the wizard mode. Leave. Why God, Lathan, the guild lords are

587
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:27,510
tools of the plague magician who is Torlok's ally. Flee across the marsh wastes and into isles.

588
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:35,479
So I don't start with any spells. I can't, I don't have my crutch.

589
02:11:40,899 --> 02:11:47,770
Ho fellow. Who are you? Gordon the Huntsman. I know much of these woods. For example, I know

590
02:11:47,770 --> 02:11:53,609
that the crystal of Kaldar will enable you to overcome the crystal tigers. Come back sometime

591
02:11:53,609 --> 02:12:00,460
and I'll share a story with you. Wait, does this mean that I'm already, I already am like a,

592
02:12:01,579 --> 02:12:16,409
wizard mode is the same game? I'm going to go down to the barren rocks. If you don't complete

593
02:12:16,409 --> 02:12:39,130
this game, I'm going to leave. I don't know what you want me to say. Last hope to find the relics

594
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:49,289
and why did I show up here? As I do, but until you hold the relics, be cautious in your use of magic.

595
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:58,060
I understand day long. So here's my question. The 22 wizards, I think it's just me over and over

596
02:12:58,060 --> 02:13:04,539
inscribed with spells of seeing. They bring sight to the blind and show those with vision that

597
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:10,229
now, which is cool. I figured it out. All right. I want the scroll of traveling.

598
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:19,979
I'll choose where in the kingdom of why I wish to go. I want to go to the haunted waterfalls.

599
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:32,699
You must use your magic to release the spell of rest.

600
02:13:33,659 --> 02:13:53,560
Right. Something in my eye. You are the world. Here's the forest. Yes. And we know what your

601
02:13:53,560 --> 02:14:13,930
quest was our friend. And we all. What else? Yeah. Okay. Very circle. I don't want to do that again.

602
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:24,460
I've already done that. Just give me my scroll of teleportation, please. I go for the blind man.

603
02:14:24,939 --> 02:14:38,810
It's the ball. You healed me. When the town hears of your powers,

604
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:43,289
the guild lords will have to give you safe passage to the haunted waterfalls.

605
02:14:43,289 --> 02:14:51,539
It is the law. Safe passage to the waterfall. Okay. That brings us up here.

606
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:54,659
We're just going to go in order. We'll go back to the healing pools.

607
02:14:54,659 --> 02:15:22,380
Thank you for not being electrified. Okay. I'm good to go. Now we're going to go from here

608
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:30,199
to the upper pools. And then, no, this is the stupid singing ghost thing.

609
02:15:36,869 --> 02:15:38,789
This is like the legend of Zelda's CD-i.

610
02:15:41,029 --> 02:15:50,039
All right. I want to go back to the, I just wasted a heal. Yeah, I did. Can you tell me anything

611
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:55,479
more? Apprentice, the plague magician knows of your quest. I know he does.

612
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:09,109
I need to go get my spell of travel. Go away. Strangers aren't welcome. Wasn't this the guy

613
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:15,909
that just told me come anytime and he'll tell me a story. My son was your age when he learned

614
02:16:15,909 --> 02:16:23,560
that the cold fire which burns on the marsh waste can destroy the mist monsters. Thanks lady.

615
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:41,750
Hello again. Martin. I once held the second relic, the hunting horn for many a year after

616
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:48,709
Mobus was gone. Now Skylar, the keeper of the clouds holds it. That's all my story, lad. Good day.

617
02:16:51,299 --> 02:16:57,219
Thanks for the story. That's the whole story. I'm going to go to the rocks.

618
02:16:57,219 --> 02:17:05,829
No, fuck. No, it's all right. I want to go here. Kill me again, Marshmallow people. I want the

619
02:17:05,829 --> 02:17:12,600
scroll of travel. Give me the scroll of travel. I want to go to the one place I haven't gone

620
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:20,780
and then I'm going to fucking delete this game from my inventory. Good. You have returned.

621
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:27,659
The new scrolls are complete. These scrolls contain traveling spells. This is a 20-hour game.

622
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:37,500
I'll choose. All right, it doesn't matter where I go. Let's just go to the waterfall and I'm

623
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:46,540
teleporting. There we go. I want to go to, so that's the palace. I want to go to the sea

624
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:52,760
dwellers pavilion. That's the only place I haven't gone in the whole world. Wait, I haven't gone to

625
02:17:52,760 --> 02:18:07,579
Dalen's mansion. Dalen's mansion. Oh fuck, that's the magician's house. I have not completed your

626
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:15,260
scrolls yet, Lathan. Continue your quest and I will have your spells ready soon. Shit. Oh no,

627
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:20,620
god, come on. I thought it was a dude. I don't know the guy's name is Dalen. He never even

628
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:39,979
introduced himself. You may not travel in poor health. What? He says it every time you enter.

629
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:43,340
I don't have subtitles and this is all the voice acting I hear.

630
02:18:43,819 --> 02:18:46,600
Oh, you are doing a very good job.

631
02:18:48,440 --> 02:19:02,389
It's like talking through a sock. I want to see that ship.

632
02:19:07,799 --> 02:19:16,069
Going back to the pool. Send me back to the pool.

633
02:19:22,309 --> 02:19:24,309
I think he said healers belong at the waterfall.

634
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:32,709
Use them healers of all the ages. Travel far. Overlook no source of health.

635
02:19:34,459 --> 02:19:40,819
There we go. Teleport to the ship. Let's go. Sea dwellers pavilion.

636
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:20,780
Shit. There is East Coast Sea. East. East Sea Coast. East West Sea Coast. Let's go West Sea Coast.

637
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:46,010
Scroll of, scroll of scene. He saw it all right. He just touched it. Yeah.

638
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:51,450
Dalen, I need more help. He didn't even die. He passed out. That doesn't count as a lie.

639
02:20:53,370 --> 02:21:06,180
I fainted. Okay, this is East Coast Sea. Valley of the Argent Kings.

640
02:21:06,899 --> 02:21:19,209
Okay. She has her trust right here. Only with the orb of moments can the coins be obtained.

641
02:21:20,329 --> 02:21:40,139
What if I go real fast? All right, take the coins or check something else.

642
02:21:49,780 --> 02:22:03,850
It's a fucking electric one. Everything has 50,000 amps going through it. 50,000 amps going through it.

643
02:22:08,250 --> 02:22:20,629
Oh, and you explode. Oh, that was great. All right, so we're going to move on.

644
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:26,950
We're going to play Space Ace now. There's another one I've never played before.

645
02:22:27,590 --> 02:22:32,700
I don't even know how the hell this one works. I'm going to take a quick

646
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:53,139
pee before we play this one. Oh, crap. Space Ace. Electrician and Chad actually

647
02:22:53,139 --> 02:23:07,430
just said it's the volts, not the amps. I know. Okay, so give me a second.

648
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:12,170
I'll be right back. I'm going to pee. I'm going to grab a water and we'll continue.

649
02:24:36,229 --> 02:24:49,500
Totally compact. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

650
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:25,500
Get me out of here. Thank you, Kimmy. I'm just kidnapped by aliens, that's all.

651
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:46,469
Totally compact. All right, Space Ace.

652
02:25:47,270 --> 02:26:05,559
Oh, crap. Far out. Let's start it. This is also Don Bluth. Oh, wait, wait, before I get in here.

653
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:20,440
Show the picture. Oh, god, that's ugly. Thank you, Kimmy. Oh, that's a great photo.

654
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:56,979
That's a good photo. Show the photo. Hold on. Let's go. Oh, shit, it is one of these.

655
02:26:57,879 --> 02:27:06,469
It is one of these. It's another one of these. Okay, move guide. Move beeps on

656
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:15,639
arcade cabinet off five lives. Difficulty. I don't even know what these mean. Cadet.

657
02:27:18,020 --> 02:27:34,780
You definitely want move guide. I'm doing cadet. How hard is this one compared to Dragon's Lair?

658
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:39,299
Well, what about captain? I'll try captain. I'll try it.

659
02:27:42,489 --> 02:27:50,840
Cabinet is spelled wrong. I'm gonna give it a go. Let's go.

660
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:11,139
Why is the genie evil? That was the genie from Aladdin. Oh, no, it's not. It's just

661
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:46,020
it's right twice. Energize? Huh? Oh, god. Go. How the fuck did I do that?

662
02:28:46,819 --> 02:28:58,340
I did it. I did it. How did I do that? Guys, I'm fucking locked in.

663
02:29:11,299 --> 02:29:39,959
Up. No, it's okay. Is it down? Maybe it's down. Oh, dude, it's too much.

664
02:29:46,549 --> 02:30:04,440
Huh? Put on the guide. I got through that pretty quickly without the guide.

665
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:32,620
Up. Left. Right. Energize. Is it the same actor that played

666
02:30:34,229 --> 02:30:57,590
who's the antagonist from Dexter's lab? What the fuck is happening? It's up. It's up twice.

667
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:28,469
Then it's left and then left. All right. What the fuck is happening? I don't even... I gotta

668
02:31:28,469 --> 02:31:45,209
turn on the guides. I think, man, this is like too ridiculous. I'm gonna try this one more time.

669
02:31:47,110 --> 02:32:05,899
You get chatified. Energize. So don't move. What? What the fuck? I thought it was energized.

670
02:32:22,379 --> 02:32:34,440
So that energizes... but am I not... I'm putting on the guide. I don't care.

671
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:43,620
I don't care. It's going on. It's going on. Get it on. It's going on. I can't even do it yet.

672
02:32:49,399 --> 02:32:51,639
What am I supposed to do during the energize sequence though?

673
02:32:54,629 --> 02:33:10,409
Doesn't he stand here? See, right? I have no idea. All right. No. Then. Right. And. Up. And. Hey.

674
02:33:22,819 --> 02:33:25,620
Oh, I could care less about... I've put... There's too many in a row.

675
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:32,010
I'm putting the guide on. I'll do it on hard, but I'm putting... I ain't doing this one without

676
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:58,120
the guide. I'll tell you. I'll put it on ace. No fucking way. Don't worry. I'll still fuck it up.

677
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:22,700
Holy shit. New path. This didn't happen before. It's too fast, man. It's too quick. I don't even

678
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:39,899
have time to react to the scenes. Oh, this would have never been done without the guide. Oh, fuck.

679
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:45,750
Hard mode is so fast, it skips cutscenes and dials.

680
02:34:47,350 --> 02:35:07,590
Does it? Should I put it back on what it was before? Yes, I should. Put it on cadet

681
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,760
so you can see all the... All right. We'll do cadet. We're just gonna... We're gonna enjoy the game.

682
02:35:13,559 --> 02:35:30,010
Cadet is just... Cadet with move... Cadet no move guide. No... I don't know if I can do it.

683
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:42,020
I don't think I can do it. I can't do it. Sometimes you have to admit when you're capable of doing

684
02:35:42,020 --> 02:36:01,139
something. It's still... It doesn't matter. I can still fuck it up and I still will over and over

685
02:36:01,139 --> 02:36:34,489
again. This music is getting in my brain. It's the song. Let's go. What? I didn't get a guide.

686
02:36:35,209 --> 02:36:48,569
I didn't get a guide for that one. Okay, remember this part? This part sucked.

687
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:52,709
Sherwin was demoralized.

688
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:16,180
It's too loud now. I have to turn it down. Hold on. I gotta turn it back down. It was way too loud.

689
02:37:20,950 --> 02:37:22,069
That voice doesn't even match.

690
02:37:25,030 --> 02:37:40,459
Here we go. Left. Shoot.

691
02:37:50,739 --> 02:38:12,700
I hate this music so much. All right. Was it that? Okay, the...

692
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:18,120
Go. All right. I finally made it past this part.

693
02:38:25,270 --> 02:38:26,629
I'll save you, Jimmy.

694
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:50,729
No way would I have done this shit without the guide.

695
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:56,120
This would have been a meltdown. An absolute total meltdown stream.

696
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:16,940
Turn back the music. Energize. Quick. Quick. Turn on your online profile.

697
02:39:17,659 --> 02:39:42,780
Get on those forums. Oh, no, no, no, no. He got banned. Oh my god. It's left. Wait,

698
02:39:42,780 --> 02:40:11,829
this guy's name is Dexter. There. Left. I know everyone was begging me to turn these on.

699
02:40:12,709 --> 02:40:19,379
No, dude. You don't understand. Like, turn it on. Turn them on.

700
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:33,129
Oh. No, why would I do that? No, no, no, no. Please, man. Do it. Please.

701
02:40:34,170 --> 02:40:38,459
We're looking out for you. Thank you. I appreciate that. You're looking out for me.

702
02:40:44,709 --> 02:41:05,590
This is definitely a pants shit game. What? Look at this shit. There's too many things going on.

703
02:41:05,590 --> 02:41:26,069
Turn back. Holy shit. It's just draining all of my energy.

704
02:41:28,069 --> 02:41:32,870
I'm drained right now. I am. All of my fucking molecules.

705
02:41:50,309 --> 02:42:07,049
I'm leaning back in my chair and I'm doing some more hard blinking.

706
02:42:07,049 --> 02:42:27,399
That's Ursula. Wait, that's that. It's that person. Okay. Hold on. Give me a minute. I need to

707
02:42:27,399 --> 02:42:37,940
actually blink. You know when somebody uploads an entire movie to YouTube and they do like the funny

708
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:45,719
joke words every time the person says the word cheese, it times two speeds itself. That's what

709
02:42:45,719 --> 02:43:01,350
I feel like I'm watching. Okay. Let's try it again. I thought the cadet was supposed to slow this shit

710
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:06,680
down. Let's speed it up. Is there blood coming out of my nose? No, I'm all right.

711
02:43:11,979 --> 02:43:17,500
It's space ace, but every time they say the word kidney, it times 10 speed.

712
02:43:28,299 --> 02:43:29,899
He just ate like a bunch of Cheetos.

713
02:43:36,659 --> 02:43:48,200
He didn't even eat me. Oh, come on. I did it.

714
02:43:49,159 --> 02:44:11,129
I may have thrown up playing this game. I just...

715
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:20,440
I made it. Okay. I made it through that one. We're good.

716
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:25,579
What?

717
02:44:43,219 --> 02:44:45,430
Somebody's screaming in my face.

718
02:44:56,309 --> 02:45:00,870
It is actually painful. You're right. It's actually kind of painful to watch. I can't imagine how it

719
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:06,069
looks on your screen because it looks like this on my screen. I imagine what it looks like on yours.

720
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:08,680
I did it.

721
02:45:27,610 --> 02:45:28,409
It's colors.

722
02:45:35,219 --> 02:45:36,420
I'll get it. I'll get through it.

723
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:59,239
Oh, let's go. It's such a small window.

724
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:20,729
I need to hold on. I need to break. I need to take a break. I need to break. This actually is

725
02:46:20,729 --> 02:46:25,370
like hurting my head. I need to fucking break. Hold on.

726
02:46:27,930 --> 02:46:38,649
Oh, Frank.

727
02:46:59,049 --> 02:47:02,889
All right. Just everybody relax for a minute. We need to take a second. Just everybody calm the

728
02:47:02,889 --> 02:47:10,120
fuck down. Okay. Just take a second. We're going to just relax. Imagine doing this shit without

729
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:16,139
the guy. I want you all to just think about that. That's never going to happen. That would never

730
02:47:16,139 --> 02:47:32,860
happen. I would fail the first sequence over a hundred times. No guide with ace difficulty.

731
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:46,100
That would be a really interesting run to watch. All right. I think I'm all right.

732
02:47:47,059 --> 02:48:00,649
I've just taken a moment. I'm ready to continue. Here we go. Let's try it again.

733
02:48:03,780 --> 02:48:07,780
All right. That's what we're looking for here. This is all one sequence. Remember that one.

734
02:48:25,959 --> 02:48:33,110
You cannot win.

735
02:48:47,399 --> 02:49:02,760
I missed it again. Oh my fucking god. I tried to hold it in. I couldn't.

736
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:13,860
Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk. Monster. Dexter,

737
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:20,729
the infant array is about to be fired at her. Where's the ray located? In the center of the

738
02:49:20,729 --> 02:49:47,690
complex. Can you get us in there? Yes. This is fucking ridiculous. I feel like this is what

739
02:49:47,690 --> 02:50:00,459
happens. I keep seeing that in my head and with my eyes open. That's not that's bad, right? I think

740
02:50:00,459 --> 02:50:08,059
so. Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk. I'm seeing these images

741
02:50:08,059 --> 02:50:14,489
after they happen. Dexter, the infant array is about to be fired at her. Where's the ray located?

742
02:50:15,209 --> 02:50:18,329
In the center of the complex. Can you get us in there? Yes.

743
02:50:19,850 --> 02:50:25,290
No, I'm here. Yes, he's geared for battle. What? Wait, didn't we just go that way with his own

744
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:40,360
inventory? No, I saw it again. No, I'm going to see it again in 10 seconds.

745
02:50:48,729 --> 02:50:53,850
No, no, I don't want to see it again. I'm going to see it again. I don't want to see it.

746
02:50:54,569 --> 02:51:07,530
Okay, I didn't get a prompt. Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk.

747
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:11,989
Dexter, the infant array is about to be fired at her.

748
02:51:14,549 --> 02:51:18,950
Where's the ray located? In the center of the complex. Can you get us in there? Yes.

749
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:26,260
Like nuts. No, I'm here. Yes, he's geared for battle. Let's see if we shoot for for the zone

750
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:34,180
inventory. Why, yes. Let's see if we can get it. Get serious. I am. Watch out for a full buddy.

751
02:51:35,139 --> 02:51:45,459
Here we come. Dexter, call me ace, huh? What happened? Did it win? Use the aquabooms. Wait,

752
02:51:45,459 --> 02:51:56,010
why did I? If the webcam was on, you guys would have just been like, holy shit, dude. You need

753
02:51:56,010 --> 02:52:28,819
to go to like the doctor. I'm out of oxygen. Use the aquabooms. Use the aquabooms. He's in the tank.

754
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:39,860
I did it. Okay, it's down. Shoot. How did we end up?

755
02:52:39,940 --> 02:53:24,649
Okay, you know when there's that the white background? No, it's like the dots on the screen.

756
02:53:30,979 --> 02:53:36,579
Why do we think that was so funny? Why was that so funny? We just, were we dead?

757
02:53:36,579 --> 02:54:09,930
Dead? That's funny to you guys that you're dead. What? We're dead. No, we're in different clothes.

758
02:54:16,280 --> 02:54:31,049
Go. Energize. Fight. And it's dodging.

759
02:54:41,579 --> 02:55:02,649
God damn it. It was up, not. It's just a button, but that button, if it's not pressed,

760
02:55:02,649 --> 02:55:22,200
within a tenth of a second, it's over. And you've got colors all over the screen and screaming and

761
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:26,120
and dodging and lightning everywhere.

762
02:56:56,219 --> 02:56:59,100
Holy shit, imagine this shit on higher difficulty.

763
02:57:00,299 --> 02:57:14,709
Throw it on your face cam. Sure. I don't care. Fine. If I don't do it this time.

764
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:19,129
Oh, I broke my computer. Oh great, I gotta re-plug this in. Shit. I'm good. Hey guys,

765
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:31,000
you want to see the cam? Turn cam on, man. What would my Joker laugh be? Honestly,

766
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:40,790
I'll do a pretty good one in a second. Hold on. Let's go plug in the webcam. I'll do a good one.

767
02:58:45,909 --> 02:58:53,829
There's a couple ways to do the Joker. There's high pitched. Well, this is the original Joker,

768
02:58:53,829 --> 02:59:02,489
which is sort of like, with your mouth open really wide. And then there's into the cartoon,

769
02:59:02,489 --> 02:59:10,280
the animated Joker, which was more of like a, almost like a witch, I would say. Something along

770
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:20,389
the lines of high pitched and really, really big, big smile. Like, that's an original animated

771
02:59:20,389 --> 02:59:31,180
Batman series. And then from there, we went to obviously he's stalling. Oh, for the love of God.

772
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:37,799
Fine. Here's my Joker laugh. I've been working on this. I almost just knocked over a fucking glass.

773
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:51,420
Stalling. Is this, am I even logged in? You can't even see it. Yeah, I am stalling. You're right.

774
02:59:51,420 --> 03:00:25,059
And you know why? Because I only see her colors right now. How do I fucking do this? I forget how

775
03:00:25,059 --> 03:00:38,309
to put the webcam on. I swear to God. There we go. Okay. Who the fuck's supposed to be sitting

776
03:00:38,309 --> 03:00:53,700
there? Monkey ass. Alrighty. I set it for you so you don't have to. Is that good? All right. That's

777
03:00:53,700 --> 03:01:00,920
fine. Like this shit even matters. Let's just put it over the, okay. Here we go. Oh, there's no

778
03:01:00,920 --> 03:02:01,239
controller, right? Okay. That sound. We didn't get the Joker laugh. Oh, sorry. I forgot.

779
03:02:03,639 --> 03:02:07,479
I forgot. I forgot. That wasn't it. That was me saying. I forgot.

780
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:09,399
Okay.

781
03:02:09,399 --> 03:02:28,700
This is a fake webcam. I should just delay the webcam for five minutes. The webcam actually

782
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:32,620
makes this harder for me because not only am I aware of the stuff on screen, I'm aware of you

783
03:02:32,620 --> 03:02:40,139
looking at my face. Guys, I treat face cam the same way I treat somebody who is watching me eat a

784
03:02:40,139 --> 03:02:46,579
sandwich. Like I know you're looking at my face right now and it's like, I don't want you to look

785
03:02:46,579 --> 03:03:23,100
at my face. All right. I got to fucking, I have to do this. I don't care. Let's go. I'm so close.

786
03:03:28,219 --> 03:03:33,899
My keyboard is fucked up. It's like, did you hear that? Did you hear the space bar get hit

787
03:03:33,899 --> 03:03:40,709
and it didn't happen? You heard it. I know you did. I've lost my mind. I can't do it.

788
03:03:42,649 --> 03:03:52,180
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 10 milliseconds behind. There's been too many fucking QTEs today.

789
03:03:52,180 --> 03:05:17,739
I won. I just beat it.

790
03:05:17,739 --> 03:05:42,739
Oh, so that was a lot more intense and a lot shorter than, um, Dragon Age. No, not Dragon

791
03:05:42,739 --> 03:06:02,469
Age. Dragon's lair. Okay. Remember I was about to say something. So that, you know, when you look

792
03:06:02,469 --> 03:06:07,430
at the dots, the, the little splotches on the screen, it's like stare at the center of this

793
03:06:07,430 --> 03:06:13,909
image for 25 seconds and then boom, don't start blinking. Cause it's on a white background. And

794
03:06:13,909 --> 03:06:21,959
you like, oh, there's, there's Jesus, right? Or whatever it is. That's what I'm doing. That's

795
03:06:21,959 --> 03:06:26,629
what happened. That's what's happening right now. Okay. So we've got Dragon's lair two. I don't know

796
03:06:26,629 --> 03:06:59,979
this one. Should I do this one? Dragon's lair two time warp. I got to change the name of the game.

797
03:07:06,010 --> 03:07:09,450
I feel like I just woke up. You know, okay. You know, when you stay up all night

798
03:07:10,979 --> 03:07:16,969
and the sun starts to come up and you, you kind of start to see that you leave your room and there's

799
03:07:16,969 --> 03:07:24,889
a window and you start to see the sun come up and it's like, that's how I feel right now.

800
03:07:26,329 --> 03:07:38,950
All right. Hold on. Dragon's lair two. Okay. Look at, okay. I want you to refresh the screen.

801
03:07:38,950 --> 03:07:46,709
I'll tell you when. So there's no Dragon's lair two, but there is a Dawn Bluth presents Dragon

802
03:07:46,709 --> 03:07:53,129
lair 20th anniversary special edition. I think it has, it has a two in it. It does have a two,

803
03:07:57,430 --> 03:08:15,690
I guess. Okay. So let's get to it. Do you want to see any extras? Should I just watch the game?

804
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:24,309
No. Okay. This is the animated FMV night. I got to go for it. Director's cut or the original?

805
03:08:24,309 --> 03:08:28,790
Five lives always. Move beats. We'll take, should I do the move God on this one? Is this one horrible?

806
03:08:29,909 --> 03:08:40,440
There's no difficulty on this one. Yes. This is so hard. This one is so hard.

807
03:08:49,829 --> 03:09:01,959
Okay. Original or director's cut? Original? Director's cut. Original. This is,

808
03:09:01,959 --> 03:09:13,639
this seems pretty contested in chat. Director. Well, I'll do director's cut. Why not? Here we go.

809
03:09:36,059 --> 03:09:40,920
I got hit so hard on the ground it killed me. That's not good.

810
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:53,590
You're destroying your house lady. Why am I, what's the context here? What the

811
03:09:53,590 --> 03:10:05,500
fuck is happening? Why am I getting thrown out? Kidnapped again. I'm being blamed.

812
03:10:18,840 --> 03:10:30,409
We're in the dungeon. Leave me alone. Why are you still fighting me in here? You could help me. You

813
03:10:30,409 --> 03:10:49,670
could be like the player two. Oh my God. Why is there a Star Wars canon here?

814
03:10:50,549 --> 03:10:56,969
A spell. Give me the key. Hurry. We'll get her back. Defeat of our wizard.

815
03:10:58,090 --> 03:11:16,860
Who is talking? Um, why are you still here? Okay. Thank God. I got a checkpoint.

816
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:55,299
You're gonna start all the way at the beginning. Oh, this is not good.

817
03:12:05,510 --> 03:12:14,010
Holy shit. This is in the arcade. They probably saw the first one and they were just like,

818
03:12:14,010 --> 03:12:19,719
you know what? Fuck it. This shit would cost thousands of dollars to beat in the arcade.

819
03:12:20,680 --> 03:12:30,819
Hopefully you had like a credit card. You need to have two assistants carry the coins

820
03:12:32,020 --> 03:12:35,479
to help you do this.

821
03:12:58,860 --> 03:12:59,420
A prisoner.

822
03:14:13,290 --> 03:14:14,010
Yes. Yeah.

823
03:14:23,030 --> 03:14:38,600
I've heard this voice actor before. Pretty good jumper laugh. That one not so good.

824
03:14:39,879 --> 03:14:50,219
You don't ever swing the sword into your own head. I thought it was gonna be left.

825
03:14:51,020 --> 03:14:51,500
I predicted.

826
03:15:18,149 --> 03:15:27,020
Talk more. I can't. I can't talk. I can't speak. I can't do it. I can't talk. I can't,

827
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:36,120
I can't talk to you. I need to just stare at this. Why is there a Doug soundtrack?

828
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:41,159
Okay. Every time there was a transition in Doug, it would do that like,

829
03:15:45,219 --> 03:16:33,459
is that happening or am I making that up? How's the movie? Because I can't see it. Is this a good

830
03:16:33,459 --> 03:16:37,129
movie?

831
03:16:46,649 --> 03:16:57,180
I am. He's not getting better. No, I'm not getting better. We've done almost three and a

832
03:16:57,180 --> 03:17:06,360
half hours of QTE cut scenes. I need to go get my eyes examined after this.

833
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:16,340
This is me. I'm gonna have to get a new prescription.

834
03:17:17,299 --> 03:17:20,979
Fuck. Jeremy. Goodness. Okay. I'm doing it now.

835
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:24,739
Cursor on the screen. Let's get it right in the middle where it belongs.

836
03:17:24,739 --> 03:17:30,739
Fuck. Let's do it. This is the one.

837
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:44,760
That's the guy that does wacko on an animated X. Got it.

838
03:17:54,010 --> 03:18:05,579
Get her. I hit left when I shouldn't have.

839
03:18:33,659 --> 03:18:48,700
I swear to God. Okay. Oh dear brother. We're brothers? I missed that part of the story.

840
03:18:51,979 --> 03:19:19,299
I'm it's the machine is his brother. What is Doug? Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Let's go.

841
03:20:05,159 --> 03:20:36,069
What if I just like, oh fuck. Just crush it in my hands. I have to. I'm gonna go like this.

842
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:45,079
I'm doing the thing that all of our parents told us to never do.

843
03:20:45,799 --> 03:20:48,760
But in this one scenario, I think it'll work.

844
03:21:21,719 --> 03:21:38,889
Oh. Exhaustion. It's QTE exhaustion. Give me a checkpoint or something. Give me a checkpoint.

845
03:21:41,159 --> 03:22:05,879
It's all right. I'm here. Yes. Good.

846
03:22:05,879 --> 03:22:19,620
Good. Wait, this is, this is fair. Wait, this is not, this is Alice in Wonderland.

847
03:22:25,270 --> 03:22:30,299
Stop shooting me with the fucking. All right. Let's go.

848
03:22:41,819 --> 03:22:52,979
I thought it was gonna be swing again.

849
03:22:56,819 --> 03:22:59,940
He looks like he's in pain is what somebody said earlier. No, I'm not in pain.

850
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:10,420
I am in total focused in locked in mode. It may look like pain, but it's not.

851
03:23:24,620 --> 03:23:39,370
Get in there. Swing. Kill. I mean, it's, it's beautifully animated. I will say.

852
03:23:44,899 --> 03:23:55,540
No, don't start at the fucking painting. Don't start at the painting. All the way back at the damn

853
03:23:55,540 --> 03:24:07,690
painting. How would you do this without a guide? Uh, you just have to be really good at catching

854
03:24:07,690 --> 03:24:14,889
every flash because notice how the screen flashes. You just have to be ready like flash. And that

855
03:24:14,889 --> 03:24:22,659
might, I'm not even sure that happens if you turn the guide off.

856
03:24:27,719 --> 03:24:33,139
That's how you can tell you're getting old. All right. After like sitting here and pressing the

857
03:24:33,139 --> 03:24:41,860
same keys, the insides of my fingers are liquidating right now. They're being liquidated.

858
03:24:42,260 --> 03:25:23,690
Oh, I thought it was up. I did it. I'm back outside. Good. I went down a new area. Nimbus length.

859
03:25:30,200 --> 03:25:42,739
It's blink time. New area of time. Blink. Again, I'm just like laughing at

860
03:25:43,299 --> 03:26:38,870
visitors. What the fuck is happening? Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. These games are crazy.

861
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:52,180
All right. I, oh, damn it. I need to, I wanted to see that one. I want to see if she just like

862
03:26:52,180 --> 03:26:59,979
put her mouth over my head and just like, Amy, please move the cursor. I can't help it.

863
03:27:00,620 --> 03:27:19,209
It's just like that. There's so much going on in every scene.

864
03:27:20,170 --> 03:27:22,950
You could dissect every single one of these scenes.

865
03:27:36,170 --> 03:27:37,049
Who's talking?

866
03:27:37,049 --> 03:28:06,469
Eat the apple. She's going to eat the apple. What? That's the beginning.

867
03:28:16,889 --> 03:28:29,829
You know, it's ridiculous about video games and gaming in general. Let's talk. Let's go over this.

868
03:28:30,709 --> 03:28:37,510
So this is, this was like QTEs. Oh, wow. It's QTEs. Cutscenes. They react fast.

869
03:28:38,629 --> 03:28:45,350
We went from this to being able to fail three to four or five of these in a fucking row and have

870
03:28:45,350 --> 03:28:49,829
nothing happening. When did that happen? We went from one extreme to the next.

871
03:29:03,319 --> 03:29:08,120
In fact, in a lot of cases, failing QTEs in games doesn't do anything. It's just,

872
03:29:08,120 --> 03:29:13,559
they added an animation. All right, I gotta focus here. I don't want to do this again.

873
03:29:27,770 --> 03:29:49,219
What? I'm on a guy's piano now. Is that the mad hatter? Everybody wants to eat you.

874
03:29:50,409 --> 03:29:56,489
That's something else too. What was with every single fucking character who wants to eat you

875
03:29:56,489 --> 03:30:11,159
in all these games from 20 years ago? Everybody wanted to just swallow you. Cats, birds, people,

876
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:18,090
monsters. It didn't matter. You were dinner for somebody in every single one of these games.

877
03:30:25,459 --> 03:30:49,899
Oh, I must press left. Why is he up here with the piano? What did he just do?

878
03:30:50,700 --> 03:30:57,209
Did he just flash the camera? I didn't even see it. I hope not.

879
03:31:27,829 --> 03:31:35,819
All right, we're good. I have to pee so bad again.

880
03:31:40,200 --> 03:31:45,239
Okay, let me ask you a question. When you have to pee, I really do feel like this sometimes.

881
03:31:45,959 --> 03:31:50,680
I'm like processing all the fucking negative energy in my body right now and I'm gonna pee

882
03:31:50,680 --> 03:32:15,110
it out. I really feel that way sometimes. What do you guys think? Do some Reddit analysis on my urine.

883
03:32:19,430 --> 03:32:23,190
Okay, I can't look over here because that's where you guys are and you guys are a distraction.

884
03:32:23,989 --> 03:32:45,350
That was an embarrassing face, I think. Remember, Jeremy, everything you do into that camera

885
03:32:46,069 --> 03:33:00,700
is is there forever. Damn it. If you type in like, Jerma into Google.

886
03:33:03,909 --> 03:33:09,030
Jerma985. I think it's still there. There's an image of my face that is one of the, it's like

887
03:33:09,030 --> 03:33:55,940
the top thing that is always shown is the one where I'm going like, like, what's this mean?

888
03:33:55,940 --> 03:34:18,659
What's that mean? When did it freeze? Are we good? I missed every single treasure. How's that

889
03:34:18,659 --> 03:34:34,780
possible? It froze on that face. We didn't, wait, what was the last thing I said? I said that's the

890
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:41,930
most searched face. Okay, then I went on to say that that's the most searched face. That's like

891
03:34:41,930 --> 03:34:45,530
the face that, I think I'm going down again. I don't know, something's going on here. Now,

892
03:34:45,530 --> 03:34:52,649
that's the most searched face. And the thing is, I have to, when my mother sees that image,

893
03:34:57,379 --> 03:35:05,270
right? Oh yeah, Jerma985, top 500 streamer, top 50 streamer. Let's look at my, you know,

894
03:35:05,270 --> 03:35:10,180
I know that because that's all he talks about at Thanksgiving every year. So we all have memorized

895
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:19,959
it by now. Top 50 variety streamer, of course. So, you know, they know. And they, that's what

896
03:35:19,959 --> 03:35:25,479
they have to see when they type in Jerma985. And that's probably the new one. Like, I'm going to

897
03:35:25,479 --> 03:35:27,959
be honest with you, take a look at that image. Let's let, I'm going to go over this image.

898
03:35:28,760 --> 03:35:36,540
You want, you want to talk about like fucking the energy that I have. Let's, I want to, I'm

899
03:35:36,540 --> 03:35:42,739
going to show you this. Look at this shit. Well, we struggled to stay live apparently.

900
03:35:45,850 --> 03:36:01,829
Here, look at this. Look at how much blood goes up into my brain. You want to know how, like,

901
03:36:01,829 --> 03:36:05,510
how smart I am, how intelligent I am? It's because this, that, that is carrying

902
03:36:06,469 --> 03:36:24,739
so much fucking liquid energy all around my body. Let's examine my face. I should have,

903
03:36:24,739 --> 03:36:32,729
you know, 2020 hindsight, I should have been a runner. Look at this one too. Take a look at that

904
03:36:32,729 --> 03:36:37,989
one. Look at this one down here, right below my chin. Look at how, look at how huge that one is.

905
03:36:38,709 --> 03:36:46,329
Look at that. That's taking so much blood up there. That's like a, that's a tube like this thick.
