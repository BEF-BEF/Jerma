1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:12,410
Hello again. How are you? I'm back. Those of you that were here last night,

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,839
sorry for the abrupt ending. Don't know what happened, but they were either doing

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,679
maintenance or there was some kind of accident or something. Maybe

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,480
potentially we don't really know. But internet abruptly just turned off

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,380
to the whole house and didn't come back. Came back for like 30 minutes and then

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:40,310
came went down again. So sorry about that, but we're back now.

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,340
Everything seems to be back in working order.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,859
I hope you're having a good day so far. I'm having a good day. I'm gonna do

9
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,179
something today that I said I was gonna do a year and a

10
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,659
half ago. Just over a full year ago I said I was

11
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,700
gonna do this. We played Stuntman Ignition on a PS2

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,390
night. Remember that? Remember when I did all those

13
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,790
PS2 games in a row? Well Stuntman Ignition was one of them.

14
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,430
And it turns out the game looks like shit and is almost unbearable to

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,109
to play and look at on PS2. So I said wait there's a PS3 version. Everyone was

16
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,549
saying there's a PS3. It's way better. It's so much better graphics, better

17
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,659
handling of the cars. So I said all right I'll get the PS3

18
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:39,379
version. I said I was gonna do that like probably in a few weeks.

19
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:45,180
It's been more than a year. So Stuntman Ignition PS3 version tonight.

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,480
Been sitting on it for a while. Here we go.

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,140
Don't know how long we're gonna play this for but I figured I would do it

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,180
because it's here and I'm gonna do it. If this takes less than a couple hours

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,819
because DOS got disconnected. We had disconnected DOS last night.

24
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,370
I will just go back and we will do more of that. I might get addicted to this and

25
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,810
I might want to play this all night. I don't know.

26
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,710
I can't tell you. So if we go more than four, five, six, seven hours on Stuntman

27
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:29,479
Ignition which is possible. I can't predict the future. We'll see.

28
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,280
But we're here and I gotta do some. You guys, I have to do some tests

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,189
with you guys because it's been a long time since I've

30
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,750
connected the original Elgato HD to this computer.

31
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,539
So we're gonna see how out of sync this is.

32
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:59,819
You ready? There it is. So if you could do me a huge favor and let me know when

33
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,580
you hear the sounds. Well I mean you're gonna hear the music

34
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:13,770
but ready? So like for instance let me like turn the music off. Okay

35
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,539
so you guys hear that right? That like let me ask you a question.

36
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:32,780
Ready? How bad is that? Are we in sync?

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:41,930
It's fine. Is it? No way. I know I'm louder but I mean I can change that.

38
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:53,819
Okay so for instance. Ready? It's in sync. That's I can't even

39
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:03,240
believe it. Okay it's a little off but it's a little

40
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,199
late. This sound is a little late. Tell me to check this out. Let me know

41
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:18,180
about it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three,

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:26,420
four. Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was that?

43
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,819
Perfect. Worse. Hey that's perfect. It's way worse.

44
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,259
The duality. Now it's worse. What about hold on.

45
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:46,699
Let me try one more thing. Just doing a little bit of experimentation here.

46
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,860
One, two, three, four. Ding, ding, ding, ding.

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,300
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

48
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:05,319
Ding, ding, ding. One, two, three, four. Now it's worse. It was better the first

49
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,230
time. Okay, hold on. Hey, welcome to German at

50
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:19,060
85. I need to let me see. Can I hear this?

51
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:38,920
One, two, three, four. All right. Now my voice is late.

52
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:50,920
It's good. All right, can I mod tell me if this is good?

53
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Okay, I'm just gonna play. Now that's way too loud.

54
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:11,660
A mod has spoken. All right, we're good. Welcome to Stuntman Ignition. Last time

55
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,860
we started the first little bit of the career. We're just

56
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:26,120
gonna do it. Remember this part? I did this for like an hour.

57
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:43,449
Remember we talked about how this was Vegeta? It's very blurry.

58
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:52,149
It's really low volume for me. Why is it so low for me and not for you guys?

59
00:06:52,149 --> 00:07:03,910
Get out of the car. Get out of the car. You only got five seconds.

60
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,209
It is low. Oh, fuck. Welcome to British Columbia. We're shooting a disaster movie

61
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,209
up here, so you'll have plenty of work.

62
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,250
Pyrotechnics, burning buildings, lava raining down from the sky. Hold on.

63
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,930
I remember this. We did the first mission and then I gave up.

64
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,730
Yeah, I'll change it. I'm gonna get water.

65
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,850
I'm told this is your first time on a big set, so I'll walk you through how it

66
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,250
works. We'll have you wired up in your vehicle

67
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,290
and your coordinator will call out all the major director stunts.

68
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,050
Yeah, you gotta do what they say. You gotta land it, stick it.

69
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,129
Yellow stunt icons. These include drifts, gaps, jumps,

70
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,649
closes, and other maneuvers. I remember this shit. We'll be using a point system to

71
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,930
judge your runs. It's deja vu. It's gonna be deja vu for the first like 20 to 30

72
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,730
minutes. More precisely you perform, more points

73
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,370
you'll land. Fail a director stunt and you'll get a

74
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,129
strike. Five strikes and Richard will have to call a reshoot, which won't make

75
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,850
him happy. Once you finish a run successfully, he'll

76
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,810
look at the court and be happy. Get motion sickness.

77
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,009
Yeah, why is the cameraman doing this? If you really nail it.

78
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,050
Richard's been doing this a long time and he's well respected. You could get all

79
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,490
this from just having a wide. You don't have to zoom in on

80
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,769
everything. I'm still on with this studio. Look, it was nice to meet you. I'll see

81
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:19,480
you on the set. All right kid, let's get you prepped for

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,319
your work on this. Oh shit, I gotta zoom in and

83
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,839
go out of focus. That's what they pay me for. You'll drive four different vehicles

84
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,560
in Aftershock, an RC-1000 sports coupe, an older SUV, a dirt bike, and a fire

85
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
chief's patrol car. Each handles differently. He's too

86
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,159
close. You pull it back, man. So just relax. These sets are big and chaotic

87
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,240
with live explosions, projectiles. This cameraman went to the school of 20

88
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,639
year old YouTubers. Or the whole production will have to

89
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,320
stop while the crew pulls you out. We've got some great stunts planned. There's

90
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,039
a high risk sequence racing over burning rooftops

91
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,080
and a huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.

92
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,120
Before each scene, I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to

93
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,240
pull them off. So just listen to me and you'll get through this in one piece.

94
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,480
All right, I'm good. And now it's fucking loud.

95
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,799
Now it's loud again. That's just how it works. Remember, every cut scene is its

96
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:15,379
own full motion video rendered video that they put at a certain level.

97
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:18,659
Okay, all I can do is the Reign of Terror.

98
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:25,000
It's gonna be right for your scene. You'll double for the town's

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,240
troublemaking drifter in his R-3000 as he flees the volcanic eruption.

100
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,840
The center of the ramp will be this huge jump over a burning semi.

101
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,360
The key is to hit the ramp straight. That'll set you up for the stunt that

102
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,840
follows. As soon as you land, you'll have a pair

103
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,440
of precision drivers coming at you fast and you'll need to gap between them.

104
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,519
It's dangerous, so be careful. And don't be afraid of retakes. Mr. Langston's a

105
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,840
picky director and it can take a while to make him happy.

106
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,679
Driving directly into the guy. Roll tape. This is our first big setup, everyone.

107
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,720
Let's focus and start the film right. Over the jump.

108
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,440
Through the middle. Here we go.

109
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,919
Three, two, one. Action!

110
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:15,000
Gap the cars. God, I just, I murdered that person.

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:25,830
What's the, what's handbrake?

112
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:45,899
How do you drift? Oh, shit! Hold on, hold on. I need to see the

113
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,070
controls. Handbrake is O. Gas, brake, steering, right.

114
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,750
Action is triangle. Okay. Got it. It's circle. Uh, Jerma sucks thanks to the five

115
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,919
community selves. Circle is handbrake. I'm ready.

116
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,679
Three, two, one. Action!

117
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:28,549
Drift turn right. Turn right. What?

118
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:43,480
Can you seriously imagine him having a fucking

119
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,279
stunt man? You're telling him what to do as he's doing it.

120
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,559
Let's move on to the next shot. Oh, hey, you're gonna have to go, let me, come over

121
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,679
here, man. Let me talk to you for a minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm new.

122
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,279
I'm the new stunt driver. Yeah, come here. Uh, we need to go through the gap and the

123
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,639
car is here. Go through that and it's gonna be the take.

124
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,919
And then when he gets in the car, you fucking like strap him in,

125
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:11,419
lock him in the front seat. Drift turn right. Guy's like fucking screaming.

126
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:18,600
You have him like locked in like straight jacket style.

127
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,159
Screaming the commands and it's, you never told me any of this shit before.

128
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:29,139
Oh, you guys can't hear me. You can't hear what I'm saying.

129
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,539
Fuck.

130
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:48,870
Let's watch the replay. Ooh, almost got by that guy.

131
00:12:48,870 --> 00:13:11,990
Nice. A guy in a mustard dress shirt. No, I kind of just said fuck that one.

132
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm not doing that one. All right, let's keep going. New scene.

133
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:27,220
This next scene is a lava flow. Lava flow.

134
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,419
This is just GTA V with a cinematic camera.

135
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,220
And stunt stringing is how you rack up the big numbers.

136
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,379
That's just a regular day in GTA V. And goes into your stunt string.

137
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,500
If you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt,

138
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,740
that will continue your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier.

139
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,220
Now your stunt stringing. Be sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper

140
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,860
left. It tells you what stunt you just performed

141
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,500
and how long you have until your string breaks.

142
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,740
That one's hard to do.

143
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,740
String them.

144
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:18,740
Fifth star.

145
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm never going to get five stars, guarantee.

146
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,899
Zero. Wait, what? Wait, hold on.

147
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,620
My total score should be zero. Is he just telling, is he making fun of me?

148
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:44,580
I feel like he was just talking shit. Okay, string the scene.

149
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,779
Let's go. Three, two, one, go.

150
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,519
I gotta, I gotta hold on a minute here. Is there a way that I can make this so

151
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,080
the audio, the, the, it's gotta, gotta keep it all the same level.

152
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,960
Menu volume is gonna be the, let's just do like this.

153
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,879
Everything at 60. Car volume six, right?

154
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,360
Like then everything would be the same and I can adjust it perfectly.

155
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,139
You know what I'm saying? It's the menu volume that's fucking it all up.

156
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,179
I think that's gonna be good. Let's go.

157
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,759
We all right? I think so.

158
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:34,679
String it. Pretty good. What's next?

159
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,809
Too early. Got it. That's not bad. That's not bad.

160
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,480
It's gonna be four step, five stars. That's good.

161
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,289
Does anyone remember when I did this the first time?

162
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,129
It took, I couldn't do this.

163
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,769
I specifically have this memory of being, of being angry at the game

164
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:03,429
because I could not do this. What happened?

165
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,629
I don't understand. What changed?

166
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,139
All right. Today's role will be the drifter's last scene when he tries to escape the town

167
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,539
and gets torched by a lava boulder at the end.

168
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,700
The feature stunt is the pyro charge.

169
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,500
I was not pretending. I was probably like fucking tired.

170
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,419
Which will mark on your HUD. Trigger the charge and set your car on fire.

171
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,500
It'll get hot, but you'll be wearing a cool suit.

172
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,139
Once you're lit, drift hard to the right and gap through the car wash.

173
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,740
That'll extinguish the fire. Then race on to the big finale.

174
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,059
And remember kid, watch out for that lava.

175
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,769
Yeah, but the PS2 version was like unplayable.

176
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,809
It was like 12 frames a second at like 360p.

177
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,580
String it. Here we go.

178
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,299
Three, two, one, action.

179
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,750
You have to stay out of the lava.

180
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,190
Three, one, action.

181
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,569
God, that drifter is not going to be alive.

182
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,339
Car wash. Oh my God.

183
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,380
I had an instant fucking headache again.

184
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,779
I knew it was going to take less than five minutes.

185
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,079
God damn it.

186
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:56,650
Motherfucker's dead.

187
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,490
Motherfucker's dead.

188
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:08,599
It's a burning building.

189
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,240
It's horrible.

190
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,890
Why am I alive?

191
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,980
I want to see.

192
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,869
Ignite your vehicle for the first time.

193
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,430
Hot wash and hot wax.

194
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,390
Okay, cool.

195
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,869
I got a color customizer.

196
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,390
Very nice.

197
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,069
You unlock the R3000.

198
00:18:47,670 --> 00:19:25,079
It's too loud.

199
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:36,089
The camera angle's bad because I killed the director.

200
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:36,730
Yeah, that's true.

201
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,690
Oh God, my fucking stomach hurts.

202
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,380
I did a pretty good job, but I contained myself pretty well here.

203
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,500
What?

204
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,259
What happened to that car?

205
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,819
That car just flew forward.

206
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,019
And then they just detonate me.

207
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:16,990
That person's not alive.

208
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,630
There's no way.

209
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,559
Okay, let's keep going.

210
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm really, really...

211
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,359
I'm so glad I actually a year later decided to play this game.

212
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,470
So this is a volcano climb.

213
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:46,539
How can a game be so loud and so quiet at the same time?

214
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,759
Thank you Klosski for the five community subs.

215
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,259
Thank you.

216
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,460
Five subs coming up.

217
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,279
Let's talk motorcycles, kid.

218
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,519
Directors love them because they're fast and loud and add punch to any scene.

219
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,400
But they're also harder to control and a lot more dangerous,

220
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,759
so watch out or they'll be mopping your skull off the pavement.

221
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,319
There are two major stunts unique to the bike.

222
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,599
What are the unique ones?

223
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,279
It's a great way to start any motor run and keep your strings alive.

224
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,279
How do you do a wheelie?

225
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Just pull back?

226
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:22,589
Yeah, all right, you just pull back.

227
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,150
Then there's the slide.

228
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,109
To pull it off.

229
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:26,670
Oh, nice.

230
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,109
Perform the action as you pass through the designated stunt box.

231
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,430
That'll make you lay the bike down on one side while you're still barreling forward.

232
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,589
That's a lot of info on the screen for just holding left.

233
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
Simple as that.

234
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,440
Let's see what you...

235
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,799
All right, let's go.

236
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:48,619
What are all the diagrams for?

237
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:49,339
Yeah, I just...

238
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,220
Somebody just had...

239
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,019
I mean, it is like a Hollywood movie studio,

240
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,740
so there's somebody just making slides for everything.

241
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,400
They make slides and like storyboards and shit for like what they eat for lunch every day.

242
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,680
Doesn't surprise me.

243
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:24,910
Oh, it's hard to do on the bike.

244
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,390
I don't know if it's going to be U-turn.

245
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:54,910
This is like when you're driving in the car with like your mother or something.

246
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,029
I go, can you take me to the bank?

247
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,349
Yeah, sure, ma.

248
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:01,630
Oh, what bank do you want to go to?

249
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,589
I know how to get there.

250
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,390
Just listen to me.

251
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,789
I'll tell you.

252
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:04,509
What's the...

253
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,309
Put it in GPS.

254
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,390
No, no, no, I don't need the GPS.

255
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,630
I don't need that fucking stupid technology.

256
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,680
And you get to like the turn that you need to go to,

257
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,519
and they're just like, oh, yeah, like when I...

258
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,759
When your grandfather and I used to...

259
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,920
We used to smoke every day and...

260
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,960
No, stop, stop, stop, stop!

261
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,720
Just tell me the address, grandma.

262
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,880
I can do that better.

263
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,569
Slide under.

264
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,500
Nice.

265
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:52,319
Spring, spring, spring.

266
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:05,740
What?

267
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,700
That was a U-turn.

268
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,200
I just did it.

269
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,559
Huh?

270
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,619
All right, we're good.

271
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:25,099
I got it.

272
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,029
No, don't play again.

273
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:28,509
Next scene.

274
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:42,279
Looks so goofy.

275
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,660
U-turn.

276
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,009
U-turn.

277
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:50,650
No, you.

278
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,210
No, you.

279
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,250
I see what you guys are doing.

280
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,400
There we go.

281
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:10,220
Oh, I did it.

282
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:19,579
All right, just get me out of this.

283
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:24,569
In this scene, you'll be doubling for a desperate team

284
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,890
racing through the carnage to rescue his grandmother

285
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,170
and her mountain cabin.

286
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,130
The key stunt begins with a jump off a downed semi

287
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,329
over some collapsing trees.

288
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,369
Keep it high speed when you land.

289
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,009
Then a blast will hurl a couple of cars right at you

290
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,130
with some serious force.

291
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,089
Dodge under the flying cars by sliding the bike

292
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,369
like we rehearsed.

293
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,210
After the slide, you'll move real quick

294
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,849
into a hard drift left, so be ready for it.

295
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:48,970
Continue up the mountain.

296
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,210
After that, Grandma will tell you where to go after that.

297
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,849
She'll tell you how to get back to Grandma's house.

298
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,769
Let's see that desperation in your driving.

299
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:19,630
Wait, hold on.

300
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,029
Hold on.

301
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,750
Wait, wait, wait.

302
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,029
Guys, I can push him over there.

303
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:22,829
Just wait a second.

304
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:23,470
This is important.

305
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,710
Three, two, one, action.

306
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,750
I gotta be quick about it, though.

307
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:44,859
Let's go get Grandma.

308
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,410
Close left.

309
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,829
Through the gap.

310
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,759
All right, come on.

311
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,240
I can hit this.

312
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,009
Use action.

313
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:07,880
Why?

314
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,319
Why would I use action there?

315
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,269
Come on.

316
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:25,400
All right, we got it.

317
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:40,319
We got it.

318
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,799
New color.

319
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,299
Nice.

320
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,259
Okay, here we go.

321
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:44,220
Let's watch that movie.

322
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:55,069
What?

323
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,880
No.

324
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:00,829
No.

325
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,619
Bad editor.

326
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:11,420
Bad editor.

327
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,720
That's unfortunate.

328
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:20,809
Cameraman missed it.

329
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,410
Well, to be fair, why would the cameraman

330
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,170
be filming at the crew?

331
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,210
There's no reason for that.

332
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,750
That was like a Tony Hawk rhyme.

333
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,589
That was way cooler than what they wanted me to do.

334
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:41,049
All right, let's keep going.

335
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:44,990
Career meant new scene.

336
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,910
Three, two, one, Earthshake.

337
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,339
What?

338
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,980
Can I have a suit of armor?

339
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,940
I have a t-shirt on.

340
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,259
Oh, my God.

341
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,980
Yeah, the budget doesn't call for anything besides a red t-shirt.

342
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:40,589
Good luck on the 180-foot fall.

343
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,000
Where do I go?

344
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,740
Action.

345
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:51,710
Get up.

346
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:58,720
Close to the explosion.

347
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,660
What?

348
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,380
Was that a jump?

349
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,450
All right, I got it.

350
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,210
I thought I had to drift here.

351
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,170
No, he's going to go through.

352
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,450
Close call.

353
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,559
These people, who are these other people?

354
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,240
I would hate to be one of these other stuntmen.

355
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
Right through the sign, right there.

356
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:44,960
Boom.

357
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,000
Why am I still on my...

358
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,039
Hard left turn.

359
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:57,920
I don't even know.

360
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,420
What?

361
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,180
You...

362
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,150
Come on.

363
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,710
U-turn.

364
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:16,769
U-turn.

365
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

366
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:28,910
I got it, I got it, I got it.

367
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,910
Three, two, one, action.

368
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:36,170
No.

369
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,049
God damn it.

370
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:47,529
Through the sign, right here.

371
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,759
And then there's another...

372
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,640
Where's that other jump?

373
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,079
Right there?

374
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,740
Left turn.

375
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,539
Damn, that's hard.

376
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:09,470
Doesn't have to be real lava.

377
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,190
You don't have to have real lava.

378
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,309
Three, one.

379
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,549
Doesn't need to be actual magma.

380
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,069
Wait, wait, how would you even get that here?

381
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,480
I gotta be going faster than this shit.

382
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,339
Right there, got it.

383
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,170
All right, land.

384
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,130
Land in the box.

385
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,690
In the box.

386
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,289
Got it.

387
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:49,740
It's that frame rate, man.

388
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,779
Come on.

389
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:55,799
Break through.

390
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,599
Use action.

391
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,799
Action, and then I have to drift.

392
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:02,609
U-turn.

393
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:05,529
Fuck.

394
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:14,009
That was such a shitty jump.

395
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:21,920
Why?

396
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Get out of my fucking way.

397
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Why would they break in front of me?

398
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,279
Jump the shack?

399
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:39,420
I did it, okay.

400
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,230
It's one star, I'm gonna laugh.

401
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,730
Thank God.

402
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:48,960
It's two.

403
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,319
Dude, that's two stars, it's all right.

404
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,589
We don't even need to see the replay on this one.

405
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:56,109
But we're gonna, we have to watch the replay on all of them.

406
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,390
Not bad.

407
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:05,390
All right, that person, that person's on fire too.

408
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,440
They don't even have like a head protector, mask, or anything.

409
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,159
Just burning.

410
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:21,070
Ooh, that was pretty dirty.

411
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,349
That was weird too.

412
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:25,230
Why did that speed up?

413
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,110
Is this going like three times speed?

414
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,829
What's going on here?

415
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,119
It's playing this EDF music.

416
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:41,900
Could've, yeah, I could use a little work.

417
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:48,909
What did I do wrong here?

418
00:34:49,550 --> 00:35:10,699
This game is fucking ridiculous, I love it.

419
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,780
We're almost done with the first set of scenes here.

420
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,559
This is first tremor in the movie Aftershock.

421
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:23,130
In this scene, you're stunting for a vulcanologist

422
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,289
racing down the mountain to warn the authorities

423
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,050
that this eruption is gonna cause even more damage than everyone thinks.

424
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,250
With a big stunt, you'll off-road to a ramp on a hill,

425
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,690
take a long jump over a chasm, crash through the support beams,

426
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,730
and land on the bridge.

427
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,010
Chunks of lava have torn the bridge to hell.

428
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,889
So after you land, watch for a quick series of pitfalls

429
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,409
and make your way to the other side.

430
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,570
You've held your own so far on this film.

431
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,690
Keep it up.

432
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,369
Gonna have to do this a few times, I think.

433
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,079
I'll do my best.

434
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,239
Keep up the speed.

435
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,559
You didn't tell me that was, what the fuck?

436
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,679
Got it.

437
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,780
Not bad.

438
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:22,239
What?

439
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,730
Through the gap.

440
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:31,239
I don't know what to do.

441
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,760
I don't know what else to do.

442
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,239
I don't know what...

443
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:44,679
This counts like a fucking backwards...

444
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,420
Go backwards over it.

445
00:36:51,500 --> 00:37:02,739
String it.

446
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,670
Through it.

447
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:12,510
I did it.

448
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:26,269
Land in the box.

449
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,510
No, please.

450
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,110
Oh, god damn it.

451
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:54,119
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:05,389
Take him out.

453
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:09,210
He's taking me out.

454
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,280
I got a minute.

455
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,840
I'm good.

456
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,880
No more mistakes.

457
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,969
The X is X, X, X, X, X, X.

458
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,250
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

459
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:32,750
I got it.

460
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,219
Forgot.

461
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,280
I forgot that happened in the beginning.

462
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,460
No X.

463
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:54,000
How is that not through the burning house?

464
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,599
I don't...

465
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,480
What happened?

466
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
Why is that not through the burning house?

467
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:09,599
Restart it.

468
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,789
This car sucks.

469
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:24,909
Give me my motorcycle.

470
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,980
Turn left.

471
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:41,679
Downhill.

472
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,980
Through the burning building.

473
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,119
Hard right.

474
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,730
Through the gap.

475
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:53,469
He's doing it.

476
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,039
Through the trees.

477
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:06,409
In the box.

478
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
Come on, something.

479
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,679
I love keep up the speed,

480
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,199
but it's like possible.

481
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,320
There's so many turns.

482
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:36,969
All right, crush through.

483
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:42,449
Ah.

484
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,590
We're good.

485
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,349
Next time, what is it?

486
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,320
Tell me.

487
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,630
Oh no.

488
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,670
Am I gonna make it?

489
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:06,380
I got it.

490
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,280
What?

491
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,920
There's more?

492
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:12,699
What?

493
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,670
What does he want me to do?

494
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,519
He was still...

495
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,679
He was sitting right here.

496
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:37,840
Why would you be 10 feet in front of where the guy lands from a huge jump?

497
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:47,800
You set the camera up and get out of the way, man.

498
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,820
Let's take a look.

499
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,469
Finished product.

500
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm always in the same clothes, too.

501
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:09,360
Nailed it.

502
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:19,630
GTA V.

503
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:26,039
It's funny because this is playing GTA V online in cinematic mode.

504
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,730
There'll be helicopters flying around, dropping missiles, and you're driving around.

505
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,489
This actually is what this is like online.

506
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,429
Cars that have just recently exploded on every single street.

507
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,400
Not even a helmet on me, either.

508
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,409
This is a long scene.

509
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:07,239
I messed that up.

510
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:07,739
I don't know.

511
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:15,550
All the doors are open.

512
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,949
No, all the doors on the right side are just open.

513
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,840
Did they edit?

514
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,739
Did they edit that?

515
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,179
I feel like I was there for much longer.

516
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:41,619
They did.

517
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,429
They fixed it in post.

518
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:44,929
That's cool.

519
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:50,329
All right, that's Aftershock.

520
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,000
Stunt City.

521
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,599
Fire unlocked.

522
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,469
Now there's more Aftershock.

523
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,719
Here comes the escape.

524
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:05,679
This is the end, for sure.

525
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:12,139
This next run calls for a special stunt maneuver called the Reverse 180.

526
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:13,019
And it's a bit tricky.

527
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:13,579
Oh, no.

528
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,019
Let's make sure you've got it down so you're not wasting time and money on the set.

529
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:18,780
I'm gonna blow this so bad.

530
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:21,579
First, come to a complete stop.

531
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,659
Then hold your brake to take off in reverse.

532
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,699
Once you've gathered some speed, move the wheel hard all the way to one side.

533
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,820
That'll start your spin.

534
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:33,719
Is that talking in the background?

535
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,480
When it turned about 90 degrees, move the left stick in the opposite direction.

536
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,280
Release the brake.

537
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,760
Never gonna do it.

538
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,840
Throttle it hard to bring you through the 180.

539
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,639
Never gonna do it.

540
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,679
With the right timing, you should come out straight and fast.

541
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,039
And ready to hit your next mark.

542
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:47,719
All right, let's give it a go.

543
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,480
Okay, I'll try.

544
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,400
It's gonna take a few attempts.

545
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,690
I do this in the parking lot all the time.

546
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,250
Don't do that.

547
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:02,190
Absolutely don't do that.

548
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:03,630
What are you?

549
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,429
Don't do that shit.

550
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,719
All right, complete the stunt.

551
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:08,119
Let's go.

552
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:08,920
Reverse 180.

553
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:17,530
That was perfect.

554
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,449
How was that not correct?

555
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:32,329
I got it.

556
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:32,809
I got it.

557
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:33,369
I got this.

558
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:35,610
That's not bad.

559
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,090
I got this.

560
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,480
This is the final scene we'll be shooting for Aftershock.

561
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
We've saved the toughest for last.

562
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
You'll be doubling for the town's fire chief,

563
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
escorting some fire engines across town.

564
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,199
The mark he's done here is a reverse 180 on the second floor of a parking garage.

565
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,199
After you've whipped your car all the way around like we practiced,

566
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,159
you'll need to keep enough speed to crash through the barrier,

567
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,360
fly out of the garage, and land on the other side of the lava.

568
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,320
I have to actually break through this concrete barrier.

569
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,159
So you better give it your all.

570
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:08,639
You can't just paint a piece of cardboard gray.

571
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,000
I have to have enough speed to drive through the concrete.

572
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,440
Stay with them.

573
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,079
Break through the fence.

574
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,369
Gap the cars.

575
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:45,079
What?

576
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:47,800
He just threw a car at me.

577
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,280
Where's the reverse 180?

578
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:13,369
Through the building.

579
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,320
No, fine.

580
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,190
That's so dangerous.

581
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,710
What the fuck are you thinking?

582
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:26,110
That's insane.

583
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,579
Just sitting in the middle of the road with all these explosions.

584
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,719
I can still make it.

585
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:47,280
All right, here we go.

586
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,079
Here we go.

587
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:48,800
Reverse 180.

588
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,199
Here it comes.

589
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:50,760
What?

590
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,420
Second floor.

591
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,219
Here we go.

592
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,179
I got to remember how to do this.

593
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,190
Reverse 180.

594
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,139
Stop and reverse.

595
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:21,880
Got it.

596
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:24,860
What?

597
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,010
Bullshit.

598
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,650
I had that.

599
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,659
I did that perfectly fine.

600
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,300
How are you supposed to go that fast through the barricade?

601
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:51,230
I want to see this.

602
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:57,150
Imagine setting all this up for another shot.

603
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,110
Yeah.

604
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:05,739
This scene alone was like $175 million.

605
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,599
You're not just going to take it as the guy.

606
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,440
There he is.

607
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,000
He's here.

608
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,760
That's the moment in the Disney movie when everyone's like,

609
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,440
no, is he?

610
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,130
Where is he?

611
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:29,610
He's okay.

612
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:31,050
And he's okay.

613
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,570
And he comes out and like sinks with three.

614
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,159
All right, I don't understand what went so wrong.

615
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,969
Why am I in a firefighter outfit?

616
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,280
Wait, am I a fireman or am I a policeman?

617
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:03,929
Oh, I'm okay.

618
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:04,969
I am a firefighter.

619
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:17,530
Here it is.

620
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:25,389
Fine.

621
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,469
I'm fine with that.

622
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:28,190
Come on.

623
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,510
Really?

624
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,920
Three, two, one.

625
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,320
Action.

626
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:33,530
Break through the fence.

627
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,010
Do it again.

628
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:40,590
A little too fast.

629
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,789
I'm on two wheels right now.

630
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:43,630
Cut.

631
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,429
Downward.

632
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:44,829
It's not.

633
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,010
Shit.

634
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,690
Three, two, one.

635
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,010
Action.

636
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,150
I'm going too fast.

637
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:00,570
Is there a reason why I can't do this now?

638
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,170
I did it first try last time.

639
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:13,019
Coming up.

640
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:15,050
Frame rate.

641
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,250
No, I'm a liar.

642
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:22,110
No shit.

643
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:22,909
Monica, no.

644
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,789
See, I landed in there that time.

645
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:26,349
Did you see that?

646
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,429
I hit my back tires with lava and I didn't fail.

647
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,809
We called that bullshit.

648
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,829
There goes another one.

649
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:45,449
In the same spot.

650
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:46,809
Doing it again.

651
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,400
You think they would have learned from the last shoot.

652
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,030
Just be the same guy.

653
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:05,340
I'm in there.

654
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:11,739
I'm gonna get this right.

655
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:18,190
I just have to go fast enough to get over the gap.

656
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:25,880
Here we go.

657
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,710
Here it comes.

658
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,190
Here it comes.

659
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:28,750
Here it comes.

660
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,679
Here it comes.

661
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,989
Is it?

662
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:44,139
What?

663
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:44,539
What is it?

664
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:44,940
What?

665
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,900
What does it want me to do there?

666
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,250
What the fuck?

667
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,050
What do you mean 180?

668
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,250
I can't fuck anything else up.

669
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:13,320
Come on.

670
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,610
Through the gap.

671
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,409
Don't touch anything.

672
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:25,880
Got it.

673
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,179
Just barely.

674
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:31,050
No.

675
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,900
We can't.

676
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:36,559
Still two stars.

677
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,099
I'm okay with it.

678
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:39,260
All right.

679
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,619
Let's watch the actual finished product.

680
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,340
I know I can't skip.

681
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,329
People are gonna be like, oh, you don't have to do it.

682
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:49,130
Just skip it.

683
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,570
It's gonna be like, no skipping.

684
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:56,219
We're in 300 or more air time points.

685
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,610
The world's done the world.

686
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,489
Fire down below.

687
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:06,199
Color customizer unlocked.

688
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,599
Okay.

689
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:09,960
Not allowed to skip, right?

690
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,440
Let's see it.

691
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:14,030
Pretty good start.

692
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,280
You can hear the guy in there going.

693
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,199
God damn shit.

694
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:35,369
You see that dodge and it hit that car that was behind me and exploded.

695
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:42,460
We don't have to.

696
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,659
Do we watch the whole movie?

697
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,590
Is there any dialogue in this movie?

698
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,070
Or is it just these six scenes back to back?

699
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,599
I got this pretty well.

700
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:59,000
For the first time I've ever seen that, it was all right.

701
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,480
Oh, it's because I fell down.

702
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:07,960
No, I didn't.

703
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:14,730
They followed a camera guy just ran up the ramp.

704
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:23,610
That was awesome, but I didn't even get points for it.

705
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:35,630
We just need a gorilla reading a book at the end of this.

706
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:35,869
Yeah.

707
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:54,000
Here we go.

708
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,349
That hesitation.

709
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:03,550
That was like, what am I supposed to do?

710
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,230
This that hard break into no, no, I have to go forward.

711
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:15,820
I'm concentrating so intently right now because I had four strikes.

712
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:28,349
It wasn't crispy enough.

713
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:28,829
It's all right.

714
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:43,210
I was escorting the fire truck and the fire truck at the end didn't make it.

715
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:52,320
All right.

716
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:52,960
Movie.

717
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,639
Wait, movie trailer unlocked.

718
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:07,559
No, really?

719
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:08,840
Come on, little buddy.

720
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,679
There's nothing to be afraid of.

721
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:13,320
So you go into that softball tournament next Sunday.

722
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:27,199
Did you guys feel that?

723
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:27,920
That was it.

724
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,679
Staying here is suicide.

725
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,599
Try to be a hero.

726
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,679
Just try to stay alive.

727
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,639
If you'd listen to me in the first place, we'd all be safe by now.

728
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:14,000
This is not the time.

729
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,800
There is no more time.

730
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,699
Uh, is that implying that the earth is destroyed?

731
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,719
The best part about all that is they make you really feel like you were a part of that.

732
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:47,949
But they really only took two or three clips of me driving the straight line

733
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:53,340
because I must have been so bad that they didn't get anything cool.

734
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,340
They got me driving down the road.

735
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,900
Director intro stunt coordinator.

736
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,139
All right.

737
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,139
So, uh, we're good, right?

738
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:05,420
So I can just go.

739
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,619
No, no, no, no, no.

740
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,659
What the hell are you doing?

741
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:08,699
Aren't shot in orders.

742
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:12,940
I hope you know this next scene comes just before those weren't even my scene.

743
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,980
He's still trying to get out of town and up to his grandmother.

744
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,380
The big moment here comes early in the run.

745
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,900
When you take the ramp over a major drop and smashed through a burning bill.

746
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,699
Time to reshoot.

747
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,619
Do I have to go back to the menu?

748
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,219
Career menu.

749
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,260
Yeah.

750
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:34,559
Career menu director intro.

751
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,340
We already did this, didn't we?

752
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:41,099
Career.

753
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:43,119
Hold on.

754
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:43,519
Is that it?

755
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,360
Oh, all right.

756
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,480
I was going to say no way.

757
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,099
Okay.

758
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:54,539
So this is a whooping and a hollering too.

759
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:59,559
Can't speak here for a while.

760
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,760
Oh, yeah.

761
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,159
Okay.

762
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,000
This is this is whooping and a hollering too.

763
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:06,110
Sup, dude.

764
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:06,829
I'm the director.

765
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:07,550
Andy faction.

766
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,590
Andy in the house.

767
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:09,389
Whoop.

768
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:12,269
Hey, guys, this is the stunt driver.

769
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:13,949
No, you're the stunt driver, dude.

770
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:14,829
The stunt driver.

771
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:16,190
I thought you were a beard.

772
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,949
Guys, take these fireworks to my butt.

773
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,429
Jim boy's playing the lead, so you'll be doubling for him.

774
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:21,469
What's for a reality show?

775
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:24,110
We had Jim flab a bridge in his shopping cart with handcuffs on him.

776
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:24,909
Seth Rogan.

777
01:00:24,909 --> 01:00:26,110
He's like chained to a goat.

778
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:27,070
That was sweet.

779
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,590
That goat ain't coming, man.

780
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,670
That's our version of stunt driving, man.

781
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,469
Anyway, dude, this flick's called whooping and hollering too.

782
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,550
Back road and cracker fest with some trouble making brothers

783
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,710
getting in car chases with the cops and all that kind of stuff.

784
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:44,429
You just like your trailer park family, or you just want to fight me?

785
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:45,150
I can do that one.

786
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:45,869
I can do that one.

787
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:47,789
So you got to make a killer, you know?

788
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:50,349
We've planned out some huge crazy ass stunts for you.

789
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:53,150
So any chance you get to flare it up, just do it, OK?

790
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:53,949
You just take it.

791
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,269
I'm not afraid to go to jail to make a poor cop.

792
01:00:56,269 --> 01:00:57,949
Jim boy, put your hands on my booty.

793
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:58,429
Awesome.

794
01:00:58,429 --> 01:00:59,230
That's awesome.

795
01:00:59,230 --> 01:00:59,710
Yeah.

796
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,550
I'm trying to make a movie here, dude.

797
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,989
That's the coolest thing ever.

798
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:04,670
Just hit your marks, and we'll be cool.

799
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,949
It's good to meet you, man.

800
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:07,869
Have fun out there, and I'll see you on the set.

801
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,590
I don't even know where the set is.

802
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,579
Look, kid, this director's a clown, so we

803
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:18,219
may have to work double time to give the producers what they want.

804
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:18,699
Get up.

805
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:19,420
Of course, they signed me, Jim.

806
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,619
The bait, you're like a four wheeler.

807
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:23,659
We'll mostly double for the Creek boys and their signature muscle car,

808
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:26,539
the General Stewart, as they try to stop the corrupt sheriff from

809
01:01:26,539 --> 01:01:28,460
foreclosing on their family's land.

810
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,059
You'll also have a scene on a dirt bike as your crazy brother Otis.

811
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:35,980
A fun scene is Uncle Cletus in his monster truck full of moonshine,

812
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,420
and a great run as a bank robber in a hijacked armored truck.

813
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:43,659
This will be your first time to shoot chase scenes, so be sure not to fall too far behind

814
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,460
the lead car, or we'll have to stop and reset.

815
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,820
Most of the action happens in the town square, but we've also got some exciting

816
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,940
stunts planned in the junkyard and in the lumberyard.

817
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,340
Baxter and his crew are all about backwoods mayhem, so I hope you're ready to

818
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,099
tear things up, literally.

819
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:00,860
I'm ready.

820
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,179
In this first scene, the Creek boys' Uncle Cletus has loaded a ton of moonshine into

821
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,219
his monster truck, and he's trying to escape the cops.

822
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,699
Big thing here are the crushing stunts.

823
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:15,260
When you see a crush icon, drive your truck over the marked car to smash it.

824
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,260
This is a tightly choreographed run, and if the icon turns red,

825
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,460
that means the car's left the shot and you've blown your chance.

826
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,260
It's about it.

827
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,460
Let's start this movie right.

828
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:25,500
All right.

829
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,900
Okay, let's get this freaking movie started.

830
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,400
Crush.

831
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,110
Here we go.

832
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,909
Three, two, one, action.

833
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,510
Hit the police car.

834
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,309
I missed.

835
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:42,889
Hit the police car.

836
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:47,900
I missed all the police cars.

837
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,780
Hit the police car.

838
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:58,829
No.

839
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:00,090
I got a double?

840
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:03,579
I'm gonna make it.

841
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:06,599
I actually did.

842
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,039
I just got nominated for an award.

843
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:28,110
I can do that better.

844
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,099
This movie stinks.

845
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:43,019
Movie stinks.

846
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,900
No, I can do that better.

847
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,409
One, action.

848
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:53,929
Hit the police car.

849
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,429
What the fuck are you doing?

850
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:17,920
Okay.

851
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:25,489
One.

852
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:41,969
Let's go get it.

853
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,590
Do it again, do it again, do it again.

854
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,090
I can do it again.

855
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,300
Three, one, action.

856
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,500
Hit the police car.

857
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:01,800
Okay.

858
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,739
Hit the police car.

859
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:03,239
Straight through.

860
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,579
Hard right.

861
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:06,179
Smash the sign.

862
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:07,039
Got it.

863
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,079
Hit the police car.

864
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:08,579
Hit the police car.

865
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,949
Hit it.

866
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:23,039
Yeah, I got it.

867
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:35,980
If you can't do it, you'll be consumed.

868
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:36,480
What?

869
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:36,980
Perfect.

870
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,829
Get off.

871
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:39,329
Ten.

872
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:40,510
Quick precision.

873
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,309
Precise.

874
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:44,530
Four stars.

875
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:48,289
I did it.

876
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,349
Five stars.

877
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,949
Threader is stringing the entire movie scene.

878
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,699
It's got bonus, like a five-star replay.

879
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,769
What does that mean?

880
01:05:59,809 --> 01:06:10,849
At least it's a better cut.

881
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,849
I don't know.

882
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,420
That was pretty clean though, until we got over here.

883
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:28,099
I still snuck it in.

884
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:28,599
Ready?

885
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:29,960
Whoops.

886
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:31,860
Yeah, I still got it.

887
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:39,460
On the bike, right?

888
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:49,679
Car commercial unlocked.

889
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:51,639
Wait a minute.

890
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:56,039
Is it a car commercial that I can do in this game?

891
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,730
I'm looking forward to that one.

892
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:11,539
In this scene, you'll double for some bank robbers as they try to escape the Creek boys and the cops in a hijacked armored vehicle.

893
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:14,900
The challenging stunt is this double overtake near the end.

894
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:20,340
You've got to pass the police car, then thread the needle to pass the semi.

895
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:26,659
If you haven't built up enough speed, you'll smash into the semi head-on, so make sure to lay heavy on the throttle.

896
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:29,780
And remember, the more collateral damage, the better.

897
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,260
This game is an assault on the senses.

898
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:32,980
It really is.

899
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,739
It's gonna be really cool, so break it loose!

900
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:40,840
110,000 points.

901
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,340
One.

902
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:42,219
Action.

903
01:07:52,050 --> 01:08:01,059
Ah, sorry.

904
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:02,260
Scrape the police car.

905
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,619
Scrape the truck.

906
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:09,159
The gap.

907
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:09,659
Yeah, yeah.

908
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,059
And it's better.

909
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:20,069
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

910
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:20,569
One.

911
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:21,439
Action.

912
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,359
Scrape the police car.

913
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:30,520
On.

914
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,369
I gotta be right to the left.

915
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:34,869
Two.

916
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:35,609
One.

917
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:36,409
Action.

918
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:48,020
Hard right.

919
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,520
Ripped.

920
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:56,119
I still gotta-

921
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:56,920
No!

922
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:00,720
Through the gap.

923
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,420
Don't touch anybody.

924
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:01,920
Through the gap.

925
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,039
It's okay.

926
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:18,539
It's okay.

927
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:19,560
I can still finish it.

928
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:31,479
Ow.

929
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,670
I didn't even tell you that was gonna happen.

930
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,789
They just killed me.

931
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,050
That was driver's side.

932
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,569
Driver's side.

933
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,149
That's the scenario, I think.

934
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:17,909
It just- everything turned off.

935
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:23,159
The game freezes at a- when you are down to the level.

936
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,159
But that is what would happen.

937
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:28,220
I'm driving down that road and then it's off.

938
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:28,720
Everything's off.

939
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:42,250
Oh, shit.

940
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,050
Good job, boys.

941
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:53,449
I can't.

942
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,149
I'm gonna say it again.

943
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,869
One more time.

944
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:17,640
Yeah, that was really as if somebody spawned that truck in.

945
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:36,840
And that- I like- I might like that more than I might like the last one.

946
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:45,609
It's like a perfect cut, too.

947
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:50,949
This game is awesome.

948
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:57,689
Mail run.

949
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:03,750
Next, you'll stunt for Otis Creek, the brother with a couple screws loose.

950
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,590
He's taking revenge on the corrupt sheriff by disrupting his beloved

951
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,069
Catfish County Chicken Day Parade.

952
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:12,710
Your big stunt is an extended wheelie.

953
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,949
Gap between these cop cars, then one-wheel it all the way across the porch.

954
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:21,750
Then come down hot so you'll have enough speed to take this final jump.

955
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,750
And don't let the giant chickens distract you.

956
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:28,279
Andy, how come you always get to call out the director, dude?

957
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:28,920
Shut up!

958
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,420
Shut up!

959
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,359
There's a giant chicken.

960
01:12:41,159 --> 01:13:10,069
Did I- heck, did I make it?

961
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:31,819
I'm just still concerned about the guy that just got crushed through the gap.

962
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:32,319
What?

963
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:34,319
No!

964
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,300
It's okay.

965
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:36,800
It's okay.

966
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,779
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

967
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:39,979
Land on the semi.

968
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:40,479
No!

969
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:54,220
I thought it was gonna be on the ground.

970
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,100
Well, I wanna see.

971
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,899
Let me see what happens.

972
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,020
Because somehow I went- I jumped the car.

973
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:06,539
It's POV camera.

974
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:12,409
This is sped up.

975
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,600
Double jump.

976
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:31,829
It's gonna be like a laugh at this game.

977
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:33,829
Like, I don't even know what else to say right now.

978
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:56,680
All right, I can do it here.

979
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,359
Play again, let's go.

980
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,319
Three, two, one, action.

981
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:06,819
Don't hit the car.

982
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:16,170
I'm gonna take the left.

983
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:32,010
I hit by that fucking truck.

984
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,899
We both got hit.

985
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:36,340
Oh, I need to calm down.

986
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:36,899
Through the gap.

987
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:39,619
Jump the lake.

988
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:46,970
I- I can still do it.

989
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,810
I just don't- don't fucking- I gotta get up here.

990
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:50,890
Up on the ledge.

991
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,880
Oh my goodness.

992
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,560
Okay, then it's up here, over here.

993
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:07,430
Come on!

994
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:17,340
It's all right.

995
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:17,840
Jesus!

996
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:20,779
Really?

997
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:28,779
Okay, I'm gonna take that one.

998
01:16:29,739 --> 01:16:32,899
We were filming that, right?

999
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:33,939
I want to see-

1000
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:36,020
No, we both get hit by the semi at the same time.

1001
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:44,920
That was brutal.

1002
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:56,340
Everything was going real well up until that point.

1003
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:14,140
Who was the third dead person?

1004
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,460
There was somebody lying under the tire.

1005
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:20,340
Who was the other guy?

1006
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,869
Off the bike.

1007
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:36,180
It's somebody else.

1008
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:38,979
Come and get on the bike.

1009
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,890
Another stuck man came and got on the bike and drove it away.

1010
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:52,390
Okay, so two people got murdered right there and then behind the truck another stunt man was like,

1011
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:55,189
oh shit, get on there and drive away with the same jacket.

1012
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:00,810
Well, I need- we gotta- I want to see that again.

1013
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,329
I need to- I wish I could slow it down.

1014
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,300
Is that what actually happened?

1015
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:12,170
So, there's two people involved here.

1016
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:24,039
Here we go.

1017
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:25,960
Dead!

1018
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,159
So, where's the third person?

1019
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:34,569
I can't even fucking think about that right now.

1020
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,949
There you go.

1021
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:41,770
That was a hard jump cut.

1022
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,250
Strike Force Omega Unlocked.

1023
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,609
All right, we're not done with this one yet.

1024
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:51,050
Why wouldn't they make another one of these games?

1025
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:54,600
Where's Stuntman 4?

1026
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,180
Because I know there's one more, right?

1027
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:03,590
This next run calls for a special stunt, so let me break down how it works.

1028
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:05,829
It's called two-wheeling or skiing.

1029
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:09,189
It's one of the trickiest maneuvers in stunt driving, but master it,

1030
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:11,750
and you'll really start turning heads in the industry.

1031
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:14,869
You'll begin by hitting the ramp with one side of your car.

1032
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:17,430
That'll kick you up so you're riding on two wheels.

1033
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:21,670
Once you're up, hold steady on the throttle and use the left stick to keep your balance.

1034
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:26,390
Watch where you're going because you must two-wheel in the indicated zone to pass the stunt.

1035
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:30,310
To successfully maintain your two-wheel, it's all about control.

1036
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,550
Small adjustments will turn the vehicle.

1037
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:35,029
Big adjustments will raise or lower your vehicle.

1038
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:40,149
Once you're ready to come out of it, turn towards the low side or tap the E-brake to come down.

1039
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:41,350
Ready to give it a try, kid?

1040
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:43,520
Yeah.

1041
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:45,180
I guess.

1042
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,659
I can't believe All Might is talking to Jerma.

1043
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:58,560
Yeah.

1044
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:20,619
Drive on two wheels?

1045
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:24,220
Oh, are you sure you didn't want me to get on the right side and slide?

1046
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:32,819
No, what the fuck?

1047
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:34,260
Why is it so hard to do this?

1048
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:38,439
Hold on.

1049
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,399
It just ripped over.

1050
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:44,359
Three, two, one, go.

1051
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:45,479
Drive on two wheels.

1052
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,300
Dude, it's really hard to do this.

1053
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,090
I have to be going slower.

1054
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,609
Three, two, one, go.

1055
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:02,649
Drive on two wheels.

1056
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:08,420
Get down.

1057
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,300
Get the wheel down.

1058
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,579
This is actually really hard to do.

1059
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,479
It's really kind of...

1060
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,340
Three, two, one, go.

1061
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,380
Drive on two wheels.

1062
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:26,869
I mean, I just...

1063
01:21:26,869 --> 01:21:27,510
Let's see how...

1064
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,310
I can't turn.

1065
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,989
If I turn, the car starts to fall down.

1066
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:33,560
And I just technically did it.

1067
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,239
Let me do it again.

1068
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:36,520
Okay.

1069
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,479
Now you'll double for the Creek Boys, racing to City Hall to save the family farm.

1070
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,680
Other than some two-wheeling at the top, once the wheels are in the air,

1071
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,399
if I hit left or right stick, it like goes up or down.

1072
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:48,439
And I can't turn the car.

1073
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,579
After a left turn, come in straight and clean with a good amount of heat

1074
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:56,460
so you can pull the 180 right as you pass the semi.

1075
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,579
It'll take some practice to learn exactly where to start the drift.

1076
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:00,939
So don't sweat a few retakes.

1077
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,640
Dude, if you can nail these stunts, I will totally give you my sister's number.

1078
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,159
Oh, go for that, dude.

1079
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:11,479
Yes.

1080
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:13,880
Seriously.

1081
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,439
Nice.

1082
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:15,319
I think she's Asian.

1083
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,000
Here we go.

1084
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,520
Three, two, one, action.

1085
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:28,789
One.

1086
01:22:28,789 --> 01:22:36,220
Excuse me.

1087
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,340
What's wrong here?

1088
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,340
Three, two, one, action.

1089
01:22:40,060 --> 01:23:14,949
No, it's okay.

1090
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:15,270
I got it.

1091
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:15,989
I broke it anyways.

1092
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:39,670
Two wheels.

1093
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:46,819
No, not bad.

1094
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:49,300
I did it first pretty much first real try.

1095
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:59,399
Oh, I got in the nomination.

1096
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:09,770
Let's take a look.

1097
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:15,140
Two people in the car now.

1098
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,859
I did do that pretty well.

1099
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:22,899
That was, and I didn't hit a single person.

1100
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:27,609
Didn't even hit that guy.

1101
01:24:28,489 --> 01:24:35,430
I was focused, except for that part.

1102
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:40,539
I had the break for the last.

1103
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:57,260
Can't wait to see the trailer for this one.

1104
01:24:57,979 --> 01:25:05,350
Only probably one or two more scenes, right?

1105
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:14,090
I've improved.

1106
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,090
Look at three, three, two, two, two, two.

1107
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,850
This is five, four, three, three.

1108
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,050
Getting better.

1109
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:29,000
This next scene's a race between the Creek Boys and another redneck in his souped up hot rod.

1110
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:31,159
The key is to follow the lead car.

1111
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,840
We'll have it clearly marked.

1112
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,439
You can't bump it too hard, can't get ahead, and can't fall too far behind.

1113
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:42,199
There'll be some jumps, 180s, and other stunts where you'll lose sight of the lead, but relax.

1114
01:25:42,199 --> 01:25:46,520
Long as you stay the course and keep roasting your tires, you'll meet back up with it soon.

1115
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:48,520
Don't get too close.

1116
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,199
Stay close enough where you're still in the game and don't overtake them.

1117
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:55,479
Pretend like you're playing your little brother in Mario Kart.

1118
01:25:57,079 --> 01:25:58,119
Quiet on the set, everybody.

1119
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:03,659
Shut the hell egg in this movie, not suck.

1120
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:08,489
All right, let's go.

1121
01:26:08,489 --> 01:26:11,529
Three, two, one, action.

1122
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:12,649
Follow the lead vehicle.

1123
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:14,710
Just need to see.

1124
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:20,979
I didn't even scrape it.

1125
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:45,979
That was a much better stunt than what they wanted me to do.

1126
01:26:45,979 --> 01:26:47,020
You can't turn.

1127
01:26:47,020 --> 01:27:11,579
No, you can't.

1128
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:23,819
You gotta, it's gonna be the worst one.

1129
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:25,260
Jump the logs.

1130
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,140
Jump the logs.

1131
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:30,949
Okay, sure.

1132
01:27:30,949 --> 01:27:31,750
Just do it again.

1133
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,510
Three, two, one, action.

1134
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,550
Follow the lead vehicle.

1135
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:38,229
Scrape the vehicle.

1136
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:03,350
I'll just add my own stunts.

1137
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:19,430
Big drift.

1138
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,760
I'm doing my own stunts.

1139
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:38,229
No, the tree just ruined everything.

1140
01:28:38,949 --> 01:28:39,909
Why did you do that?

1141
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:42,470
I had like a four or five star going too.

1142
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:43,909
Jump the logs.

1143
01:28:43,909 --> 01:29:03,380
There he is, I'm fine.

1144
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:07,100
Oh shit, I got it.

1145
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:11,369
Oh my god, how was I supposed to know?

1146
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:22,819
Oh no.

1147
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:31,619
It's fine.

1148
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,819
He's totally going to work.

1149
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:03,029
I can't even watch the game replay.

1150
01:30:03,029 --> 01:30:03,750
It doesn't even matter.

1151
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,789
Whatever.

1152
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:16,949
I'm Jack Lee, General Steward.

1153
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:20,119
You are average.

1154
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,319
Well, two and a half would be average.

1155
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:25,850
A little bit above average.

1156
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:29,369
Let's see if we, in full motion video.

1157
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:45,319
Added my own stunt here.

1158
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:48,859
I jumped this entire semi.

1159
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,380
That's some people doing their shit right there.

1160
01:30:54,500 --> 01:31:27,770
The chicken sound was perfect.

1161
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:33,609
Here we go.

1162
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:36,140
Leads a good view.

1163
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:45,560
See the temptation there to just run that guy over.

1164
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:47,670
I didn't do it though.

1165
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,109
I wanted to finish this.

1166
01:31:49,109 --> 01:32:04,100
Here we go.

1167
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:16,779
That was actually way, way better.

1168
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,220
The music stops and the music picks back up.

1169
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,539
By design, as intended.

1170
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:47,220
This will be a bad action, but we'll do a good comedy.

1171
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:56,300
All right.

1172
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,819
Stunt City Team Unlocked.

1173
01:32:57,819 --> 01:32:58,380
Here we go.

1174
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:04,140
We are at the final scene of movement and hollering.

1175
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,699
This is the other side of the bank robber chase you shot in Grab and Go.

1176
01:33:10,699 --> 01:33:11,260
Not the side.

1177
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,859
And the last scene for this movie.

1178
01:33:12,859 --> 01:33:14,539
This time you'll play the Creek Boys.

1179
01:33:14,539 --> 01:33:17,500
Trying to stop the hijacked armored vehicle to get some reward.

1180
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,819
Do I get a Mario Kart ghost that is on the screen too?

1181
01:33:19,819 --> 01:33:20,619
Another chase scene.

1182
01:33:20,619 --> 01:33:23,500
So remember, don't fall too far behind the lead.

1183
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:27,100
The key stunt is a jump onto the upper deck of a storefront.

1184
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,340
Hit the jump and break through the balusters.

1185
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:34,380
Once on top, keep that speed going to hit the jump and clear the semi.

1186
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:34,939
All right.

1187
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:36,539
Let's get out there and break some stuff.

1188
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,619
That would be awesome if it actually is the other cars.

1189
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,210
That was all over one radio.

1190
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,130
They're all leaning in.

1191
01:33:54,710 --> 01:34:01,180
That's me, right?

1192
01:34:02,329 --> 01:34:02,970
That's other me.

1193
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:11,750
It's definitely other me because it's dropping like a fucking idiot.

1194
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,750
Scrape.

1195
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,829
Oh, I just barely scraped.

1196
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:30,840
Scrape.

1197
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:32,390
Again.

1198
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,869
Okay, good.

1199
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:36,779
I am.

1200
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:44,020
That was tricky, but I did it.

1201
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:53,399
I think I just, I think I just accidentally killed that car.

1202
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:04,939
Did I get it?

1203
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:05,260
I got it.

1204
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:16,920
Over the tanker.

1205
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:23,380
Now what?

1206
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,579
That's a real hard left.

1207
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:39,609
Damn it.

1208
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:40,729
That's not, that's going to be the end.

1209
01:35:41,689 --> 01:35:42,489
That's going to be the end of me.

1210
01:35:43,449 --> 01:35:49,880
No, got into the tires.

1211
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,590
Um, do I have to keep going?

1212
01:35:54,229 --> 01:36:03,140
Apparently not.

1213
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:14,649
We're in a one-star ranking for all seasons in an all-around guy.

1214
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:18,149
Taurus World Stunt Ward.

1215
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,010
More color customization.

1216
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:28,810
Don't skip.

1217
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,689
You don't skip it.

1218
01:36:30,409 --> 01:36:51,670
Why is it stuck there?

1219
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:58,470
That was pretty tight.

1220
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,319
I do something up here that I'm really proud of, actually.

1221
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:05,720
I weave in and out of like four or five trees, like right here.

1222
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,359
Ready?

1223
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:08,359
One, two, three trees, four trees, five trees.

1224
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:11,560
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen trees.

1225
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:12,680
You see that?

1226
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:28,979
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three.

1227
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:41,899
Most of those were lamps.

1228
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,340
I'm excited for the trailer.

1229
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,220
I'm going to do the commercial.

1230
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:14,840
Nice.

1231
01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:17,670
Three stars.

1232
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:28,550
All right, time to be quiet and watch the trailer.

1233
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:36,600
You look mean, Sheriff.

1234
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:37,640
You look mean.

1235
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:42,439
Well, maybe this will be enough to remind them boys whose town it is.

1236
01:38:43,800 --> 01:39:13,300
Definitely.

1237
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:57,350
There we go.

1238
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:01,739
Uh, it was whooping in a hall room, too.

1239
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:10,489
Where's the commercial?

1240
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:12,810
Oddjobs.

1241
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,310
Ooh.

1242
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,130
Stunt City Club.

1243
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:15,630
Hold on.

1244
01:40:16,489 --> 01:40:17,130
Rehearsals.

1245
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:18,810
Hold on.

1246
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:19,210
Here we go.

1247
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:20,810
Stunt City Fire.

1248
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:21,369
Car commercial.

1249
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,970
I'm doing a car commercial.

1250
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:32,390
In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom driving the new Venus Vexation

1251
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,510
sports car.

1252
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:37,590
The gags that you out-drive Night Avenger because your car is so fast.

1253
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:42,069
You'll be using Nitro and the key run happens during your second boost.

1254
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:45,829
Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.

1255
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:51,590
Then overtake Night Avenger on the left and end with a huge drift right.

1256
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:53,350
Turning will be hard at high speed.

1257
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,510
So you'll have to anticipate the stunts early.

1258
01:40:58,229 --> 01:41:03,180
You're faster than Batman in product placement.

1259
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:03,680
Okay.

1260
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:04,960
I'm ready.

1261
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:15,140
There's Batman.

1262
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:28,020
All right, I gotta be cleaner than that.

1263
01:41:33,699 --> 01:41:34,899
No failures are allowed.

1264
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:53,840
What?

1265
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,279
Oh, I didn't even know it was over there.

1266
01:42:22,109 --> 01:42:24,909
Shit, this is one of those addicting goddamn games where it's going to make me just sit

1267
01:42:24,909 --> 01:42:25,949
here for like an hour, isn't it?

1268
01:42:32,029 --> 01:42:35,609
I tried to pass close, but he flew backward.

1269
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:50,539
What's going on here?

1270
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:53,020
Three, two, one, action.

1271
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,460
This car is too fast.

1272
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:12,890
Show them this.

1273
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:30,640
What?

1274
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,850
I couldn't get what the fuck are you talking about?

1275
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,760
Get close to the explosion.

1276
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,199
You blew it up on top of me.

1277
01:43:45,840 --> 01:44:03,479
I'm faster than Batman already.

1278
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:04,680
I'm faster than Batman.

1279
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:07,449
Tell him to speed up.

1280
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:09,130
Can we switch cars?

1281
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,409
Just paint this one black.

1282
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:19,560
Just give him this one.

1283
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:36,649
What happened?

1284
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:41,449
What happened there?

1285
01:44:41,449 --> 01:44:41,770
What happened?

1286
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:42,970
I didn't do anything.

1287
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:44,970
I didn't do anything.

1288
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:46,810
All right, I overtook him.

1289
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:47,689
I drove in front of him.

1290
01:44:49,529 --> 01:44:52,170
How else do you overtake somebody besides like driving around?

1291
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:23,880
Am I going too slow?

1292
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,840
Two, one, action.

1293
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,399
I did overtake this thing.

1294
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:36,680
He didn't say overtake.

1295
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,130
Watch, ready?

1296
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,069
So I overtake this guy.

1297
01:45:43,069 --> 01:45:43,550
I did it.

1298
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:00,909
I literally drive right next to the cop car and overtake him.

1299
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:20,029
Ready?

1300
01:46:20,029 --> 01:46:23,800
Did that not count?

1301
01:46:30,409 --> 01:46:31,050
I don't understand.

1302
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:34,779
Why did it take so long to fail again?

1303
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:38,960
One.

1304
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:45,000
Why is it waiting to the end of the level to fail it?

1305
01:46:45,000 --> 01:47:07,689
I got you.

1306
01:47:15,159 --> 01:47:24,329
I can get five on this one.

1307
01:47:24,329 --> 01:47:24,890
Let's do five.

1308
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:39,159
One, action.

1309
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:50,399
That was close.

1310
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:51,770
That's all the shit.

1311
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:56,510
I can do five on this one.

1312
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:59,310
Three, two, one, action.

1313
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:02,880
Drip left.

1314
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,640
Last try, that's it.

1315
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:23,050
Christ, I'm spamming triangle.

1316
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:23,770
Why?

1317
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:25,449
Oh, I'm so angry right now.

1318
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:27,050
I'm fucking furious.

1319
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:30,090
I'm literally sitting there hitting triangle.

1320
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:31,710
Three, two, one, action.

1321
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:34,380
That doesn't make any sense.

1322
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,579
Drip left.

1323
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:47,239
That is impossible that I didn't get that.

1324
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,840
It's actually impossible.

1325
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:52,430
One, action.

1326
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:55,869
I'm gonna look at a chat, hold on.

1327
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:57,470
Three, two, one, action.

1328
01:48:57,470 --> 01:48:57,949
This is it.

1329
01:48:57,949 --> 01:48:58,829
This is the last one I'm gonna do

1330
01:48:58,829 --> 01:49:00,109
and then I'm gonna fucking pee and come back.

1331
01:49:00,909 --> 01:51:52,510
Hey, let's go.

1332
01:51:55,789 --> 01:51:57,529
Five.

1333
01:51:57,529 --> 01:52:00,329
In this show, you'll drive a bike that's on fire,

1334
01:52:00,329 --> 01:52:03,289
causing explosions as you drive close to propane tanks

1335
01:52:03,289 --> 01:52:04,569
and other vehicles.

1336
01:52:04,569 --> 01:52:07,130
The big moment in the show starts with a slide

1337
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:09,369
beneath this semi, igniting it.

1338
01:52:09,369 --> 01:52:12,170
Then throw a 180 between the propane tanks,

1339
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:13,449
making them blow up too.

1340
01:52:14,409 --> 01:52:16,010
As soon as you've spun around,

1341
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:18,489
line up for the big ramp and gun it hard.

1342
01:52:18,489 --> 01:52:22,090
He beat up his pillow into the bedroom,

1343
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:22,489
just like.

1344
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:27,210
Hey guys, I'm back.

1345
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:30,300
What's going on?

1346
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,260
Love mech this train.

1347
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:41,920
Jesus, this looks damn good.

1348
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,880
Three, two, one, action.

1349
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,079
He starts off the jump.

1350
01:52:46,079 --> 01:53:01,739
Oh, I almost missed it.

1351
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,000
Let's reset, try that again.

1352
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,520
Look at how big that jump is over there.

1353
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,869
There are traps everywhere for me.

1354
01:53:15,869 --> 01:53:16,670
That's not nice.

1355
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:18,989
Two, one, action.

1356
01:53:18,989 --> 01:53:20,270
He starts off the jump.

1357
01:53:20,989 --> 01:53:35,279
180.

1358
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:37,479
He starts off the jump.

1359
01:53:37,479 --> 01:53:39,239
Oh, you gotta start that way earlier

1360
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:39,960
and go too fast.

1361
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,600
Yeah, you're going way, way, way, way too fast.

1362
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,970
Three, two, one, action.

1363
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:53,770
He starts off.

1364
01:53:53,770 --> 01:54:14,520
I technically still did it, so it's okay.

1365
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:30,359
Jesus, that was like going down a roller coaster.

1366
01:54:42,939 --> 01:54:43,979
Four, I'll take four.

1367
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:54,510
Check it out.

1368
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:26,600
I landed on the front tire and stuck it.

1369
01:55:29,239 --> 01:55:35,659
That was pretty insane.

1370
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:41,210
There's one more here.

1371
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,199
Stunt City team.

1372
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:51,180
Might as well do them.

1373
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:54,140
The emphasis of this show is team precision driving.

1374
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,460
You'll be out there with a bunch of other stunt drivers

1375
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,140
weaving back and forth between them

1376
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:01,340
in a tightly choreographed run with lots of overtakes.

1377
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:01,819
180.

1378
01:56:01,819 --> 01:56:02,539
Back to Batman.

1379
01:56:02,539 --> 01:56:03,340
I'll show the Batman.

1380
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,460
Make your maneuvers as quickly as you can

1381
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,380
and be sure never to hit the other cars

1382
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,819
or you'll knock them off their marks

1383
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:12,380
and the whole show will turn into a collision derby.

1384
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:14,460
Fun as that sounds, it's not the goal.

1385
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,340
So behave yourself.

1386
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:17,100
This one sucks.

1387
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:17,979
This one's horrible.

1388
01:56:17,979 --> 01:56:19,100
You've seen them on TV.

1389
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:19,500
It's okay.

1390
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,239
Now see the rip roaring.

1391
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:22,800
I got this.

1392
01:56:31,149 --> 01:56:32,350
Only 60,000 points.

1393
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,510
Close to the first car.

1394
01:56:50,649 --> 01:56:52,010
You got to be perfect there.

1395
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:15,930
All right.

1396
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:16,729
What?

1397
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:19,930
I have to keep going all the way back?

1398
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:23,420
I got to go start the turn in the box.

1399
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:23,659
Okay.

1400
01:57:24,699 --> 01:57:26,510
I figured I could just go through the box.

1401
01:57:30,859 --> 01:57:42,510
You're going to restart because somebody else crashed.

1402
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:48,189
That's not me.

1403
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:49,789
The camera's not even on them.

1404
01:57:49,789 --> 01:57:50,510
The camera's on me.

1405
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:08,750
Damn it.

1406
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:30,510
Shit.

1407
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:43,289
Come on.

1408
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:44,810
What the hell?

1409
01:58:45,850 --> 01:59:06,829
What's happening?

1410
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,020
What the fuck is happening?

1411
01:59:11,739 --> 01:59:14,239
What the hell do you want me to do after that?

1412
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:15,840
It didn't say anything.

1413
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,079
What?

1414
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:25,439
What happens after the reverse 180?

1415
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:28,159
Do I have to drive by the drivers again?

1416
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:43,359
Okay.

1417
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:44,720
I get it.

1418
01:59:47,319 --> 01:59:49,159
So I have to drive near that guy.

1419
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:08,060
Did I do it?

1420
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:08,380
I did it.

1421
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:25,319
Give me a break.

1422
02:00:25,319 --> 02:00:26,760
I was right there.

1423
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,000
I caught running out of gas at the finish line.

1424
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,430
I'll get it.

1425
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,760
I'm holding right on the pad.

1426
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:51,979
I was holding right that whole time.

1427
02:00:51,979 --> 02:00:52,939
Unbelievable.

1428
02:00:52,939 --> 02:00:55,180
I can't believe I didn't fucking stop with that.

1429
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:56,140
Unbelievable.

1430
02:00:59,039 --> 02:00:59,920
Unbelievable.

1431
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:02,090
I touched him.

1432
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:02,649
Game over.

1433
02:01:03,609 --> 02:01:08,060
I was holding right trick.

1434
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:08,460
I was.

1435
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:18,920
Dude, I could see like a 17, 18-year-old losing his fucking mind.

1436
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,399
I'm 34 losing my mind too.

1437
02:01:22,039 --> 02:01:22,600
It doesn't matter.

1438
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:29,640
That age doesn't matter.

1439
02:01:48,029 --> 02:01:50,750
When I hovered over this, somebody in all caps wrote,

1440
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,029
this one is horrible.

1441
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:54,989
And I was like, what are you talking about?

1442
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:13,760
Get in there.

1443
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,239
I did it.

1444
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:14,960
Everything's fine.

1445
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,600
Don't worry about it.

1446
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,159
It's good.

1447
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:16,720
I'm good to go.

1448
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:17,439
Everything's perfect.

1449
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:36,560
I'll take four.

1450
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,159
I don't want to see the replay in this one.

1451
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:39,279
I don't want to see it.

1452
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:44,140
It's angering me even just like smelling this in my vicinity.

1453
02:02:45,739 --> 02:03:07,949
It actually gave me the boost I needed.

1454
02:03:19,229 --> 02:03:19,710
There you go.

1455
02:03:20,909 --> 02:03:21,630
All right.

1456
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,750
Back to the career menu.

1457
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:24,960
Where's the Batman at?

1458
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:29,210
Overdrive unlocked.

1459
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:34,029
I can't show you the replay of the Batman.

1460
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:34,829
I have to...

1461
02:03:34,829 --> 02:03:37,470
In this commercial, you'll play a citizen of darkdom

1462
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:40,829
driving the new Venus vexation sports car.

1463
02:03:40,829 --> 02:03:43,310
The gags that you out-drive Night Avenger

1464
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:44,909
because your car is so fast.

1465
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:46,909
You'll be using nature

1466
02:03:46,909 --> 02:03:49,390
and the key run happens during your second boost.

1467
02:03:49,949 --> 02:03:53,229
Speed past the exploding cars and under the torch semi.

1468
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:56,590
Then overtake Night Avenger on the left

1469
02:03:56,590 --> 02:03:58,270
and end with a huge drift right.

1470
02:03:58,829 --> 02:04:00,510
Turning will be hard at high speed

1471
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:02,270
so you'll have to anticipate the stunts.

1472
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,069
Take on...

1473
02:04:03,069 --> 02:04:03,869
Nice gag.

1474
02:04:03,869 --> 02:04:04,590
What gag?

1475
02:04:04,590 --> 02:04:06,750
Everyone was saying show the replay

1476
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:08,430
because I skipped it because I freaked out.

1477
02:04:11,579 --> 02:04:11,899
Load.

1478
02:04:11,899 --> 02:04:13,180
I didn't save a replay.

1479
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:13,500
All right.

1480
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:13,899
Here we go.

1481
02:04:15,979 --> 02:04:38,460
I swear to God.

1482
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,100
I swear to God.

1483
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,220
You have to understand something.

1484
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:44,060
There's no way I fucked that up.

1485
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,020
I'm hitting triangle.

1486
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:46,380
Like this.

1487
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:46,939
Do you understand?

1488
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:48,859
Like that happened twice now.

1489
02:04:48,859 --> 02:04:50,140
Like in the same spot.

1490
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,020
In the same spot.

1491
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:51,899
I'm hitting triangle.

1492
02:04:51,899 --> 02:04:52,380
Like what?

1493
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,020
I've never...

1494
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:53,520
What?

1495
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,720
That doesn't make any sense.

1496
02:04:59,229 --> 02:05:00,270
Triangle is the button.

1497
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,149
I swear to God.

1498
02:05:01,149 --> 02:05:01,710
That happened.

1499
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:04,350
Like clip this and clip one to the floor.

1500
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:05,390
That happened in the same spot.

1501
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:07,840
I swear.

1502
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:08,479
I promise.

1503
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:10,319
Why would I not look?

1504
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:11,119
Oh, it's triangle.

1505
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:11,619
Okay.

1506
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,319
I just forget how to play the game.

1507
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:17,890
Ready?

1508
02:05:18,989 --> 02:05:26,189
All right.

1509
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:28,079
It's over.

1510
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:28,560
I did it.

1511
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:42,170
That's not five stars.

1512
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,520
All right.

1513
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:44,239
I'm going to skip this.

1514
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,560
I got the five star replay.

1515
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,649
Here.

1516
02:05:50,649 --> 02:05:52,170
Just pretend this is like 25.

1517
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:36,380
That was really, really bad at rehearsals.

1518
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:36,619
All right.

1519
02:06:36,619 --> 02:06:37,180
Aftershock.

1520
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:37,819
Here we go.

1521
02:06:37,819 --> 02:06:39,180
Strike Force Omega.

1522
02:06:52,840 --> 02:07:19,449
Is that a thistle on the truck?

1523
02:07:23,609 --> 02:07:26,489
Army style truck with 50 caliber auto turret.

1524
02:07:26,489 --> 02:07:28,250
It's a badass with a capital B.

1525
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:32,029
Anyway, lots of my fans still think I do my own stunts.

1526
02:07:32,029 --> 02:07:33,310
So you better be good.

1527
02:07:33,310 --> 02:07:34,909
I got a reputation to protect.

1528
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:37,630
Now I need to go bulk up for my next fight scene.

1529
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:39,229
I'll see you on the set.

1530
02:07:39,229 --> 02:07:39,729
What?

1531
02:07:40,189 --> 02:07:41,310
You looking for an autograph?

1532
02:07:42,029 --> 02:07:45,069
Hey Marcus, get him one of those commemorative iPads.

1533
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:50,409
I'll tell you, nothing beats working with a director

1534
02:07:50,409 --> 02:07:52,810
who thinks he should be driving for you.

1535
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:55,050
I've worked with Steel before and trust me,

1536
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:56,810
he's not easy to please.

1537
02:07:56,810 --> 02:08:00,010
But the good news is the man knows how to make an exciting action film.

1538
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:02,010
So we've got some killer stunts lined up.

1539
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:02,170
All right.

1540
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:04,329
Some of the vehicles in this movie are heavily armed

1541
02:08:04,329 --> 02:08:07,210
and include a modified dune buggy, a motorcycle,

1542
02:08:07,210 --> 02:08:10,409
an unwieldy semi towing a giant Scud missile

1543
02:08:10,409 --> 02:08:13,689
and Commander Black's heavily armed assault vehicle, the Scorpion.

1544
02:08:13,689 --> 02:08:16,649
The missile is mostly open desert terrain

1545
02:08:16,649 --> 02:08:19,210
where you'll be driving on loosely packed dirt,

1546
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:21,930
but you'll also need to weave your way through the strike force base

1547
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:23,770
where there isn't much room to maneuver.

1548
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:26,170
You'll also have your first chance to use nitrous,

1549
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:29,369
giving you an extra punch of speed to make that fast escape.

1550
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:32,250
Listen to me and hit your marks and you should walk away

1551
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:33,369
with some impressive addition.

1552
02:08:34,489 --> 02:08:36,890
You'll start as a strike force Omega operative

1553
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:40,170
trying to get a stolen Scud missile back to base.

1554
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:43,289
The focus stunt is a side swipe of a combat bus.

1555
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:46,970
Don't aim straight for the bus or you'll get drawn out too far.

1556
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:50,010
Instead, aim for the gap in the bridge ahead.

1557
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:51,130
And the gap in the bridge.

1558
02:08:51,369 --> 02:08:55,130
So you can veer slightly to side swipe the bus before taking the gap.

1559
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:05,119
This is not like an active missile, right?

1560
02:09:19,689 --> 02:09:22,010
That moves with it.

1561
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:26,170
Okay, that's a tricky turn with this thing.

1562
02:09:27,289 --> 02:09:47,800
Oh, just start over.

1563
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:49,840
Just start over.

1564
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,600
I was trying to swipe him with the tail.

1565
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:11,069
Around we go.

1566
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:15,550
Scrape, scrape, get up.

1567
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:20,479
Come on, get the other one.

1568
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:22,239
Nope, didn't get it.

1569
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:43,390
Is this thing gonna blow?

1570
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:48,510
Oh, I just rolled across the bridge.

1571
02:10:52,909 --> 02:10:55,630
They blew the bridge that I was crossing.

1572
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:07,420
Once it became clear that I wasn't gonna go over the jump,

1573
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:09,180
I would just still blow the bridge.

1574
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:14,539
That seems like a bad idea.

1575
02:11:25,239 --> 02:11:25,960
Double, nice.

1576
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:30,029
Okay, I gotta go over the jump here.

1577
02:11:58,779 --> 02:12:00,859
Left, right, left, right.

1578
02:12:01,739 --> 02:12:03,020
That was panic turning.

1579
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:05,020
Sorry, three stars, I'll take it.

1580
02:12:05,979 --> 02:12:14,250
Nomination.

1581
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:20,170
Let's take a look.

1582
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:33,359
So what, I got caught on something over here.

1583
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:46,079
I didn't kill the other, I didn't hit the other guy.

1584
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:50,569
I just scraped his friend.

1585
02:12:58,380 --> 02:12:59,180
That was it right there.

1586
02:12:59,180 --> 02:12:59,899
That was the issue.

1587
02:13:08,489 --> 02:13:09,930
Actually, it was not even that bad.

1588
02:13:10,489 --> 02:13:12,170
It was pretty good, actually.

1589
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:15,310
That was fine.

1590
02:13:16,189 --> 02:13:19,800
There's the gap, though.

1591
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:25,930
Motorcycle mission, let's go.

1592
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:30,890
Now, you'll double for a strike force scout returning to base with vital intelligence.

1593
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:36,170
A challenging stunt is an aerial gap through a passing semi and into its trailer.

1594
02:13:36,170 --> 02:13:39,850
Come over a hill, then straighten up fast so you can aim for the jump.

1595
02:13:40,409 --> 02:13:42,970
Don't make last second adjustments once you're on the ramp.

1596
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:43,850
That'll mess you up.

1597
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:45,770
I have to go through a gap.

1598
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:48,329
You'll need to slide beneath a second trailer, so be ready.

1599
02:13:48,329 --> 02:13:48,970
Oh, God.

1600
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:52,359
If you're any good on a bike.

1601
02:13:52,359 --> 02:13:58,039
Okay, I guess we're gonna go, I'm just gonna go for it.

1602
02:13:58,039 --> 02:13:58,359
Action.

1603
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:00,039
Overtake left.

1604
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:12,409
What a movie scene.

1605
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:15,760
Our hero overtakes the criminal on the...

1606
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,199
Bye.

1607
02:14:20,329 --> 02:14:21,689
Not even wearing a fucking helmet.

1608
02:14:21,689 --> 02:14:22,329
No, I know.

1609
02:14:23,529 --> 02:14:30,439
This guy seriously get...

1610
02:14:31,159 --> 02:14:48,319
Now what?

1611
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:54,029
What?

1612
02:14:54,029 --> 02:14:54,590
I just...

1613
02:14:54,590 --> 02:14:55,390
Did I do that?

1614
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:56,270
Did I really do that?

1615
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:17,260
There's no way I was gonna do that.

1616
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,100
Not a chance in hell.

1617
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:22,119
Absolute zero chance.

1618
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:35,760
Ah!

1619
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:43,010
Gap!

1620
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:50,329
I can't believe I just made it.

1621
02:15:52,189 --> 02:15:53,710
I can do that one better.

1622
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:54,590
That's three, it's fine.

1623
02:15:55,390 --> 02:16:08,079
The majority of the stream has been him saying a thing that I'm not ready for

1624
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:12,000
and then me shockingly yelling the word he just said out loud.

1625
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:14,079
This is one of those comedy movies.

1626
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,279
And by the way, you gotta be careful for that gap.

1627
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:17,779
What gap?

1628
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,300
Gap?

1629
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:21,710
There it is.

1630
02:16:22,329 --> 02:16:46,059
That was a pretty cool first person cam.

1631
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,510
What?

1632
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:53,440
That was a little messed up, but it's okay.

1633
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:55,040
That first person cam doesn't work there.

1634
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,170
It sounds like I hit something else too.

1635
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:22,739
Pretty good.

1636
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,479
It's all right, I'll take three.

1637
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:32,840
Armor all, commercial unlocked.

1638
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:33,340
Nice.

1639
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:36,159
Dogs of war.

1640
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:42,479
In this scene you'll double for an enemy merc rampaging through the SFO base.

1641
02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:44,079
The key stunt is a weaving...

1642
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:45,120
It's a real brain, yeah.

1643
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:46,879
Once you're in the base,

1644
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:50,559
drift left as quickly and sharply as possible so you can set up your line.

1645
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,040
Then thread between the three semis as they come straight at you.

1646
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,600
You'll pass right, then left, then right.

1647
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:00,399
This is another high-risk stunt, so keep it safe.

1648
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:03,600
You're playing an enemy merc in this scene.

1649
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,840
I want him driving wild and crazy.

1650
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:06,719
Don't let me down.

1651
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:12,110
270,000 points, that's a lot.

1652
02:18:12,110 --> 02:18:14,430
Three, two, one, action.

1653
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:35,790
Oh my god, I'm not gonna do that.

1654
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:47,579
The thing exploded.

1655
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,940
I can't pass it when it's gone.

1656
02:19:04,059 --> 02:19:05,180
What an explosion.

1657
02:19:05,819 --> 02:19:06,319
This one.

1658
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:16,909
I love this game.

1659
02:19:16,909 --> 02:19:18,270
This game is so bonkers.

1660
02:19:18,270 --> 02:19:20,350
Three, two, one, action.

1661
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:21,959
To the explosion.

1662
02:19:21,959 --> 02:19:30,959
This pole.

1663
02:19:31,739 --> 02:19:32,379
Fuck this pole.

1664
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:34,250
You know what I mean?

1665
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:35,049
No, fuck that pole.

1666
02:19:35,049 --> 02:19:35,770
I'm not gonna let that win.

1667
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:38,489
Three, two, one, action.

1668
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:50,489
Too much drifting.

1669
02:19:50,489 --> 02:19:51,290
Too much drifting.

1670
02:19:52,170 --> 02:19:53,209
Too much drifting.

1671
02:19:53,209 --> 02:19:54,409
Drifting all over the place.

1672
02:19:54,409 --> 02:19:55,129
Way too much of it.

1673
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:59,049
Pass this guy.

1674
02:20:00,010 --> 02:20:02,420
Got it.

1675
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:13,870
Got it.

1676
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:22,989
Oh shit.

1677
02:20:24,010 --> 02:20:28,719
Which one?

1678
02:20:38,829 --> 02:20:39,469
Sloppy.

1679
02:20:39,469 --> 02:20:40,270
Very sloppy.

1680
02:20:40,989 --> 02:20:42,190
Too sloppy.

1681
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:42,989
But it's alright.

1682
02:20:46,889 --> 02:20:49,370
This is really bad.

1683
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:51,290
This is really, really bad.

1684
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:52,489
This is really bad.

1685
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:57,790
Man.

1686
02:21:03,559 --> 02:21:05,799
There was a live animal in that car with me.

1687
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:08,040
That's the only way that I can describe

1688
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,239
the way I was moving around.

1689
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:17,209
There was a fucking bear in that car.

1690
02:21:17,209 --> 02:21:33,979
This guy right here.

1691
02:21:33,979 --> 02:21:35,180
That guy fucks it up every time.

1692
02:21:36,059 --> 02:21:36,540
No.

1693
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:37,500
I gotta get around that.

1694
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:39,819
It's just, that pole sucks.

1695
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:45,500
The pole and there's an exploded car.

1696
02:21:46,379 --> 02:21:50,600
Right there.

1697
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:51,719
You gotta go around it.

1698
02:21:51,719 --> 02:21:58,780
Here it is.

1699
02:21:58,780 --> 02:21:59,899
No, pass around here.

1700
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:02,059
He just turned into me.

1701
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:06,139
You're too close.

1702
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:37,290
Fuck you.

1703
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:37,790
No.

1704
02:22:38,649 --> 02:22:41,040
That's such a small area to do that in.

1705
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:52,180
Oh.

1706
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:03,680
Damn it.

1707
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:19,680
Too early.

1708
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,399
It's okay.

1709
02:23:20,399 --> 02:23:20,899
No.

1710
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:21,860
That's gonna.

1711
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,389
No, no.

1712
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:26,250
I got it.

1713
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:26,750
No, I didn't.

1714
02:23:34,090 --> 02:23:34,889
Oh, come on.

1715
02:23:35,770 --> 02:23:38,059
Trying to line it up.

1716
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:43,340
That's not a direct thing left.

1717
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:49,139
Great.

1718
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,200
There's too many things going on.

1719
02:23:54,889 --> 02:23:57,530
No, I gotta be in the fucking circle to do it.

1720
02:23:57,530 --> 02:23:58,409
Oh, yay, yay.

1721
02:23:58,409 --> 02:24:01,870
Too many instructions.

1722
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,709
Yeah, it really is.

1723
02:24:04,510 --> 02:24:06,969
I'll get it.

1724
02:24:06,969 --> 02:24:19,610
I'm gonna get an X here.

1725
02:24:20,729 --> 02:24:22,750
No, I got it.

1726
02:24:23,469 --> 02:24:23,950
All right.

1727
02:24:23,950 --> 02:24:24,430
Smooth it out.

1728
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:24,909
Smooth it out.

1729
02:24:24,909 --> 02:24:25,469
Smooth it out.

1730
02:24:25,469 --> 02:24:25,969
I got it.

1731
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:40,620
Got it.

1732
02:24:41,159 --> 02:24:41,659
Come on.

1733
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:03,579
Okay, I'm fine.

1734
02:25:04,299 --> 02:25:14,510
Shit.

1735
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,079
That's the whole reason for the stunt to be here in the first place.

1736
02:25:42,079 --> 02:25:48,459
Dude, I went too fast.

1737
02:25:49,180 --> 02:26:10,959
Slow down.

1738
02:26:10,959 --> 02:26:14,879
I can't believe it.

1739
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:28,479
I'll get it.

1740
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:37,680
Come here.

1741
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:43,340
Please.

1742
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:45,120
Okay, here we go.

1743
02:26:57,209 --> 02:26:58,809
Close to the explosion.

1744
02:26:58,809 --> 02:27:00,010
I thought I was going too fast.

1745
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:01,530
Close to the explosion.

1746
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:02,110
It's all right.

1747
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:03,149
I can do it between now.

1748
02:27:17,479 --> 02:27:18,440
Every now and then, I went too fast.

1749
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:19,479
I fucking hate that part.

1750
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,280
Oh, damn it.

1751
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:45,059
I gotta...

1752
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:49,879
I'm playing Simon Says with cars.

1753
02:27:50,680 --> 02:28:03,819
Come on.

1754
02:28:04,459 --> 02:28:05,659
I can't touch it.

1755
02:28:05,659 --> 02:28:07,020
I can't touch the fucking thing.

1756
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:31,610
Even touch the tire.

1757
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,110
I...

1758
02:28:32,569 --> 02:28:33,069
That's dumb.

1759
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:35,290
I'm being so careful.

1760
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:36,250
Trying to get it right.

1761
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:56,360
I just want to hit the helicopter.

1762
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:58,200
I don't care about anything else.

1763
02:28:58,200 --> 02:28:59,399
Just let me hit the helicopter.

1764
02:28:59,399 --> 02:28:59,959
I don't care.

1765
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:11,469
Hit the helicopter.

1766
02:29:14,379 --> 02:29:14,879
Get it.

1767
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:17,040
No.

1768
02:29:17,659 --> 02:29:26,780
I'm all right.

1769
02:29:27,319 --> 02:29:58,459
No.

1770
02:29:58,459 --> 02:29:59,319
No, you motherfucker.

1771
02:29:59,319 --> 02:30:07,979
Don't come here.

1772
02:30:07,979 --> 02:30:08,479
No.

1773
02:30:08,860 --> 02:30:12,110
I just want to hit the fucking helicopter.

1774
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:12,590
I don't care.

1775
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:13,629
Just give me the fucking helicopter.

1776
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,840
Thank God.

1777
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:28,559
I'm finally out.

1778
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:38,700
It's worse than before.

1779
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:44,239
It's fine.

1780
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:47,659
I'll be...

1781
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,399
I don't want to see the...

1782
02:30:49,639 --> 02:30:50,840
Yes, I'll find it.

1783
02:30:50,840 --> 02:31:10,719
I think you get to play as Batman.

1784
02:31:10,719 --> 02:31:11,440
That's a good question.

1785
02:31:12,319 --> 02:31:14,989
Probably never.

1786
02:31:15,629 --> 02:31:30,090
But when it's cut up like that,

1787
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:32,649
it looks way cooler than my panic screams.

1788
02:31:33,610 --> 02:31:52,809
What is this car made out of to be able to handle that?

1789
02:31:54,010 --> 02:32:04,200
This is going to be a fun one.

1790
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:04,840
I can already tell.

1791
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:06,840
Now you'll double for Commander Black,

1792
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:10,840
protecting a strike force convoy when they're ambushed by the mercs.

1793
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:15,639
A challenging line starts with you hitting two motorcycles at the exact same time,

1794
02:32:15,639 --> 02:32:17,319
which will make them both explode.

1795
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:20,200
Then immediately throw a 180,

1796
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:24,440
and quickly line up so you can avoid the semi that's speeding straight for you.

1797
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,040
Once you've passed the semi,

1798
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:27,959
you're left to take out the next bike.

1799
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,639
Okay, it's Commander Black time.

1800
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:33,399
If you've been holding any mojo back,

1801
02:32:33,399 --> 02:32:34,600
you better show it now.

1802
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:36,200
I'm going to get hit by the truck.

1803
02:32:37,159 --> 02:32:37,959
200,000.

1804
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:38,600
Let's see if I can get it.

1805
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:40,520
Three, two, one, action.

1806
02:32:41,319 --> 02:32:47,979
Take out the motorcycle.

1807
02:32:47,979 --> 02:32:50,270
I missed one.

1808
02:32:50,989 --> 02:32:54,120
I was so focused on...

1809
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,399
Take out the motorcycle.

1810
02:32:55,399 --> 02:33:02,969
Get it together.

1811
02:33:02,969 --> 02:33:04,239
One, action.

1812
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:10,920
Right straight ahead.

1813
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:20,649
Take out the motorcycle.

1814
02:33:20,649 --> 02:33:21,129
Damn it!

1815
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:24,920
Can I still get him?

1816
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:25,639
Take out the vehicle.

1817
02:33:25,639 --> 02:33:32,000
Pass under it.

1818
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:49,420
What?

1819
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:51,879
What do you want me to do?

1820
02:33:51,879 --> 02:33:53,159
What do you want me to do here?

1821
02:33:54,360 --> 02:34:07,899
Redo, redo, redo it.

1822
02:34:07,899 --> 02:34:09,739
Restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.

1823
02:34:09,739 --> 02:34:10,459
I thought that was the end.

1824
02:34:10,459 --> 02:34:19,129
Three, two, one.

1825
02:34:19,129 --> 02:34:31,159
Take out the motorcycle.

1826
02:34:31,159 --> 02:34:31,659
Perfect.

1827
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:33,319
All right, let's make it happen.

1828
02:34:33,319 --> 02:34:34,600
Take out the vehicle.

1829
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:42,639
Pretty good.

1830
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:59,639
Take out the motorcycle.

1831
02:34:59,639 --> 02:35:00,139
Come here.

1832
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:04,100
No!

1833
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,010
Fuck!

1834
02:35:10,010 --> 02:35:11,329
I got it!

1835
02:35:12,620 --> 02:35:13,120
I got it!

1836
02:35:26,270 --> 02:35:28,350
That was times 42.

1837
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:29,549
Unfortunately, that sucks.

1838
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:39,629
It's all right.

1839
02:35:39,629 --> 02:35:40,190
I'll take it.

1840
02:35:40,989 --> 02:35:46,399
Scorpion and watch.

1841
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:47,959
And a five-star replay.

1842
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:50,270
Let's check it out.

1843
02:35:50,909 --> 02:36:00,250
That's so bad.

1844
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:02,620
That's not even a stunt.

1845
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:05,260
I'm just actually fucking murdering those guys.

1846
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:21,819
This is so lukewarm at the end here, though, really.

1847
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:35,520
I don't...

1848
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:37,200
You can't edit this to make this look any better.

1849
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,280
They kept that wide shot.

1850
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,000
That's like...

1851
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,760
That's the awkward shot.

1852
02:36:56,559 --> 02:36:57,920
It's on there for a little too long.

1853
02:36:58,879 --> 02:37:00,670
That's funny.

1854
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:11,479
A couple more scenes.

1855
02:37:11,479 --> 02:37:12,440
Behind enemy lines.

1856
02:37:13,479 --> 02:37:17,159
In this scene, you'll play as Commander Black, escaping another ambush.

1857
02:37:17,159 --> 02:37:20,120
The highlight is the use of nitrous to aid your getaway.

1858
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:23,159
There's a tricky line after your second burst of speed.

1859
02:37:23,159 --> 02:37:26,600
You'll smash into the back of a merc buggy, knocking it into the air.

1860
02:37:27,239 --> 02:37:30,520
Then pass beneath the collapsing silo before it falls

1861
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:34,440
and immediately let off the gas so you can drift hard left and stay on the road.

1862
02:37:35,479 --> 02:37:42,809
All right, let's go.

1863
02:37:44,510 --> 02:37:45,309
240,000.

1864
02:37:45,309 --> 02:37:45,950
Three...

1865
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:46,750
Two...

1866
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:46,989
One...

1867
02:37:47,629 --> 02:37:47,950
Action!

1868
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:51,180
Action!

1869
02:37:56,590 --> 02:37:56,909
Good.

1870
02:37:57,870 --> 02:37:58,430
That was good.

1871
02:37:58,430 --> 02:38:04,670
Overtake the dune buggy.

1872
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:05,309
I didn't...

1873
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:06,590
What the hell?

1874
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:16,829
Not fast enough.

1875
02:38:17,790 --> 02:38:24,680
It's a dune buggy.

1876
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,079
I did it.

1877
02:38:25,799 --> 02:38:27,709
I technically still did it.

1878
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:38,860
Through the siloooooooooooooo!

1879
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:41,020
You gotta be quick on this one.

1880
02:38:41,579 --> 02:38:50,409
Am I fast enough?

1881
02:38:50,889 --> 02:39:34,299
I gotta go all the way to the left, all the way to the left. Explosion. Good. Gate. Got him. Kill. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. Too fast. In between dune buggies.

1882
02:39:34,299 --> 02:39:51,889
Ah, didn't count. Didn't count. That was pretty good so far. That was pretty good.

1883
02:39:57,799 --> 02:40:50,600
Okay. Explosion. Hurry. Ooh. Tight. Scrape. I'm gonna miss it. No! Not again! I don't know where to press the button.

1884
02:40:51,600 --> 02:41:35,159
Ah, shit. It's so easy just to get thrown off the rails in this game. I get that start pretty good. Oh fuck, I forgot!

1885
02:41:35,159 --> 02:41:56,639
Alright, scrape. Why is that stupid thing there? The bus is just in the fucking way. Why is the bus there? What the hell do they have a bus there for? It's just in the way.

1886
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:17,329
I think it's not good enough. No. No, no, no, no. No more twos. I'm not doing it. Not good enough. It's gotta be this thing.

1887
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:56,879
Is that part of the bus? Do I have to go around the bus? Cause I can't go through it. Same deal. Go. Nitrous.

1888
02:42:57,879 --> 02:43:25,180
He's going just too damn fast. It's too fast. You go out of control. Use nitrous. Stop using nitrous. Oh, you're going 180? Ah, it's alright. You'll figure it out.

1889
02:43:25,180 --> 02:44:42,090
I'm so mad right now. That one guy on the bike. He goes so far to the left. Okay, let's go. Whatever.

1890
02:44:57,860 --> 02:45:22,680
Three! Yes, I'll take it. He killed him in the air. That was horrible. Let's see it. You go too fast, too slow, too fast, too slow. When you go too fast, something like that happens.

1891
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:58,760
I missed this guy, I think. I don't think I hit him. No, yes I do. The motorcycle. Was the motorcycle on top of my car? Yeah, that's the guy I missed. I missed him twice.

1892
02:46:11,270 --> 02:46:21,920
I tried to swipe him, tried to swipe him, and then I just took it all out on his friend, apparently. Final scene. Here we go. Final conflict.

1893
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:37,510
I'm going to flip four times.

1894
02:47:04,510 --> 02:47:38,170
I do this in parking lot all the time. No, I see what you guys are doing here. You just say that for every single stunt. Alright, so just do a roll. Sounds easy enough. Yeah, that's pretty self-explanatory. Yeah, I got it.

1895
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:46,170
After you're airborne, you'll smash through a watchtower mid-spin. When you land, veer to the left and get back on the main road and continue the run.

1896
02:47:47,170 --> 02:48:17,159
That's it? That's all you have to explain? It's great that they do all this, but then there's 20 or 30 other stunts in the middle of this whole thing that he doesn't even talk about. It's a secret.

1897
02:48:17,159 --> 02:49:08,870
325,000. That's a pretty big score. It'll never get old. It really won't, really. I actually did that by a hair. Hurry up. U-turn again. Oh, uh-oh, not fast enough. No, it wasn't.

1898
02:49:08,870 --> 02:50:14,540
Dude, oh! Did I get it? Smash the pipe! Not bad. That was as good as you could do. That it? Perfect. Is that not five stars? That's three stars. Alright, that's like a times 20 or times 30, didn't it?

1899
02:50:23,200 --> 02:51:28,719
Why don't we take a look? First try. That's the first time I've done a first try. Felt pretty good. Felt pretty good. That was way more impressive than just going through it. Landing on it and then driving off of it. I went flying. That guy wasn't even looking.

1900
02:51:29,719 --> 02:52:14,450
The guy forgot to say, and go! Start firing! Be part of the scene, man! They didn't even know I was coming. That was really good. I'll take it. Alright, here comes the turn.

1901
02:52:14,450 --> 02:52:39,979
And the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Who answer the call? We come in peace. Blazing the trail of justice in a land of corruption and terrorists at the foreign corners of the globe.

1902
02:52:39,979 --> 02:53:00,299
Bring me the weapons or I kill the hostages. This nation has nowhere else to turn. If those newts reach American soil, we'll all be glowing. They are their only hope. See you in hell.

1903
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:05,010
The guy that narrates the movies in the movies?

1904
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:27,510
That was the second time somebody went through the glass.

1905
02:53:34,059 --> 02:53:50,079
There you go. What up next is? Here are some odd jobs. Armor All. Let's do the Armor All commercial.

1906
02:54:10,170 --> 02:54:12,170
Wait, why?

1907
02:54:14,170 --> 02:54:29,750
No, after your car is nice and clean, drive into other cars. Armor All. That doesn't sound like something I should be doing.

1908
02:54:52,059 --> 02:54:54,059
It's a metaphor, I get it.

1909
02:55:01,829 --> 02:55:17,569
It's just a metaphor.

1910
02:55:25,190 --> 02:55:28,190
I remember getting very distraught over this mission as a kid.

1911
02:55:29,190 --> 02:55:32,000
There's a lot of hard turns.

1912
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:54,870
It's a lot of left, left, left, left. Scrape. No. More drifting. Ok, I got it.

1913
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:09,209
Let's all go to drift.

1914
02:56:10,209 --> 02:56:16,680
That was alright. Ooh, I still got it.

1915
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,559
That was a pretty cool stunt.

1916
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:35,239
This one's tough.

1917
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:43,250
Yeah, you do kind of have to nail it.

1918
02:56:44,250 --> 02:57:03,049
Turn left. Scrape the vehicle.

1919
02:57:03,049 --> 02:57:07,000
One. Action.

1920
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:12,959
It's that scrape that's hard to get.

1921
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:15,260
Turn left. Scrape the vehicle.

1922
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:19,079
Hit the boxes.

1923
02:57:19,079 --> 02:57:24,139
Watch out. Big drift here.

1924
02:57:24,139 --> 02:57:26,139
All the way around from the car.

1925
02:57:26,139 --> 02:57:30,360
What? That was not a drift through there?

1926
02:57:30,360 --> 02:57:32,360
And cut.

1927
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:35,309
I really felt like it did that.

1928
02:57:35,309 --> 02:57:37,309
I was drifting into it.

1929
02:57:37,309 --> 02:57:39,309
Three. Two. One. Action.

1930
02:57:39,309 --> 02:57:48,520
Too slow.

1931
02:57:48,520 --> 02:58:02,030
If anything that was like too fast.

1932
02:58:02,030 --> 02:58:04,030
It's okay. In. In. In. In.

1933
02:58:04,030 --> 02:58:22,840
I don't care.

1934
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:26,559
I want to see what's in front of me.

1935
02:58:26,559 --> 02:58:28,559
What are you talking about?

1936
02:58:28,559 --> 02:58:35,770
So it's one, two, three.

1937
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:42,430
Save the slow mo for the replay.

1938
02:58:42,430 --> 02:58:44,430
You don't have to show me from the cameraman's perspective.

1939
02:58:44,430 --> 02:58:49,100
I want to see it from my perspective.

1940
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:51,100
Hit the jump.

1941
02:58:51,100 --> 02:59:02,809
That one's going to get me every time.

1942
02:59:02,809 --> 02:59:12,280
Damn it.

1943
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:16,510
This one's got me.

1944
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:18,510
This one's got me.

1945
02:59:18,510 --> 02:59:32,319
It does. It's got me.

1946
02:59:32,319 --> 02:59:56,620
It's better.

1947
02:59:56,620 --> 02:59:58,620
Shit. One more.

1948
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:06,649
That's it. What?

1949
03:00:06,649 --> 03:00:08,649
Strike the truck?

1950
03:00:08,649 --> 03:00:10,649
I thought I had to jump.

1951
03:00:10,649 --> 03:00:12,649
Oh no. No.

1952
03:00:12,649 --> 03:00:15,659
No. No.

1953
03:00:15,659 --> 03:00:17,659
Three. Two. One.

1954
03:00:17,659 --> 03:00:19,659
Action. Strike the truck.

1955
03:00:21,659 --> 03:00:23,659
Damn it.

1956
03:00:23,659 --> 03:00:25,659
I was so focused on doing all this I forgot that it's part two.

1957
03:00:27,659 --> 03:00:29,659
It's alright.

1958
03:00:29,659 --> 03:00:35,420
Oh no. No. No.

1959
03:00:35,420 --> 03:00:37,420
No. No. No.

1960
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:48,409
I'm losing it.

1961
03:00:48,409 --> 03:00:50,409
Jump through the gap.

1962
03:00:50,409 --> 03:00:52,840
Blasphemy is so much of a pain in the ass.

1963
03:00:52,840 --> 03:01:05,899
I agree.

1964
03:01:05,899 --> 03:01:30,329
One. Two.

1965
03:01:30,329 --> 03:01:32,329
One. Action.

1966
03:01:32,329 --> 03:01:34,329
Strike the truck.

1967
03:01:34,329 --> 03:01:36,329
Strike the truck.

1968
03:01:36,329 --> 03:01:38,329
Hit the jump.

1969
03:01:38,329 --> 03:01:40,329
Don't strike it. Armor off.

1970
03:01:40,329 --> 03:01:42,329
Be gentle. Strike the side of the truck.

1971
03:01:42,329 --> 03:02:00,639
I want that guy

1972
03:02:00,639 --> 03:02:02,639
fired on the sim.

1973
03:02:02,639 --> 03:02:04,639
That guy will never work another day again in Hollywood.

1974
03:02:04,639 --> 03:02:09,239
Neither will that person.

1975
03:02:09,239 --> 03:02:23,500
Again.

1976
03:02:23,500 --> 03:02:26,059
That's...

1977
03:02:26,059 --> 03:02:28,059
I have to slide

1978
03:02:28,059 --> 03:02:30,059
into that fucking guy.

1979
03:02:30,059 --> 03:02:32,059
And I don't even know when he comes out.

1980
03:02:32,059 --> 03:02:43,159
Hit the jump.

1981
03:02:43,159 --> 03:02:45,600
One. Action.

1982
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:50,079
Pain in the ass.

1983
03:02:50,079 --> 03:02:52,079
Strike the truck.

1984
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:54,079
Strike the truck. Strike the truck. Strike the truck.

1985
03:02:54,079 --> 03:03:16,479
That's bullshit.

1986
03:03:16,479 --> 03:03:18,479
Unbelievable.

1987
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:20,479
You've got to be kidding me.

1988
03:03:20,479 --> 03:03:22,719
There's no...

1989
03:03:22,719 --> 03:03:24,719
I can't even believe that happened.

1990
03:03:24,719 --> 03:03:26,719
I have no...

1991
03:03:26,719 --> 03:03:28,719
It's fine.

1992
03:03:28,719 --> 03:03:30,719
I can't let it bother me.

1993
03:03:30,719 --> 03:03:32,719
One. Action.

1994
03:03:32,719 --> 03:03:34,719
I'm not going to let it bother me.

1995
03:03:34,719 --> 03:03:41,180
I'm good.

1996
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:43,180
One. Action.

1997
03:03:43,180 --> 03:04:26,040
Very.

1998
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:28,409
One. Action.

1999
03:04:28,409 --> 03:04:31,100
Strike.

2000
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:50,479
Strike.

2001
03:04:50,479 --> 03:05:10,239
Strike.

2002
03:05:10,239 --> 03:05:19,840
Which one?

2003
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:25,530
Okay, I did it.

2004
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:36,350
There were a lot of trucks to pick from there.

2005
03:05:36,350 --> 03:05:41,790
Three hundred and forty.

2006
03:05:41,790 --> 03:05:49,850
These commercial ones are much harder than the base game.

2007
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:51,850
It's a nice game.

2008
03:05:51,850 --> 03:06:17,559
Replay.

2009
03:06:17,559 --> 03:06:19,559
Sometimes it just seems like the elements are out to get your car.

2010
03:06:19,559 --> 03:06:21,559
That's why there's armor.

2011
03:06:21,559 --> 03:06:23,559
Tireshines for the wheels.

2012
03:06:23,559 --> 03:06:25,559
Washing wax for the exterior.

2013
03:06:25,559 --> 03:06:27,559
And protecting wipes for the inside.

2014
03:06:27,559 --> 03:06:29,559
They'll give your car that

2015
03:06:29,559 --> 03:06:31,559
armor-all protection to make sure it

2016
03:06:31,559 --> 03:06:33,559
looks its best and stays that way.

2017
03:06:33,559 --> 03:06:35,559
Armor-all.

2018
03:06:35,559 --> 03:06:49,239
Armor-all.

2019
03:06:49,239 --> 03:06:54,110
Stare.

2020
03:06:54,110 --> 03:07:00,620
Go ahead.

2021
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:09,000
Stare.

2022
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:13,360
That was definitely one of the employees of this game company.

2023
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:18,409
So if you have like

2024
03:07:18,409 --> 03:07:20,409
a twenty-nine to thirty-one second spot,

2025
03:07:20,409 --> 03:07:22,969
definitely make sure that you have

2026
03:07:22,969 --> 03:07:24,969
a twenty-nine to thirty second

2027
03:07:24,969 --> 03:07:26,969
voiceover line.

2028
03:07:26,969 --> 03:07:28,969
That was eleven seconds of dialogue.

2029
03:07:28,969 --> 03:07:31,209
Or just

2030
03:07:31,209 --> 03:07:33,209
make it a fifteen second commercial.

2031
03:07:33,209 --> 03:07:36,090
You can't

2032
03:07:36,090 --> 03:07:38,090
get some marketing guy to write

2033
03:07:38,090 --> 03:07:40,090
an extra few lines.

2034
03:07:40,090 --> 03:07:43,979
You waited way too long.

2035
03:07:43,979 --> 03:07:45,979
Alright, there's one more here. I feel like this is going to be very hard.

2036
03:08:00,719 --> 03:08:02,719
Navigate through the course.

2037
03:08:02,719 --> 03:08:04,719
Crashing through each crate and passing under the semis.

2038
03:08:04,719 --> 03:08:06,719
The trick is knowing how to

2039
03:08:06,719 --> 03:08:08,719
control your drifts on the ice.

2040
03:08:08,719 --> 03:08:10,719
And keep your eye out for those under the

2041
03:08:10,719 --> 03:08:12,719
semi-stunts. They'll be tough marks

2042
03:08:12,719 --> 03:08:15,149
to hit.

2043
03:08:27,149 --> 03:08:29,149
Jump right off the bat.

2044
03:08:29,149 --> 03:08:31,149
Only a hundred thousand. This is not that long.

2045
03:08:31,149 --> 03:08:33,149
Only a hundred thousand points.

2046
03:08:55,770 --> 03:09:06,969
Boy oh boy.

2047
03:09:08,969 --> 03:09:10,969
This is gonna be

2048
03:09:10,969 --> 03:09:12,969
one that I

2049
03:09:12,969 --> 03:09:14,969
probably don't do.

2050
03:09:19,149 --> 03:09:24,270
I can't go slow though.

2051
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:55,260
You don't have to go that fast. I can drive with it.

2052
03:10:07,930 --> 03:10:18,239
This one's not long. I can do it.

2053
03:10:18,239 --> 03:10:23,360
To recite this word more

2054
03:10:23,360 --> 03:10:25,360
in this video later.

2055
03:10:25,360 --> 03:10:27,530
Yeah, I may play the same thing

2056
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:29,530
like a thousand times. I can't talk.

2057
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:35,610
I can't talk.

2058
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:49,549
Nope. Nope. That's it.

2059
03:10:49,549 --> 03:10:51,549
No, it's not. Oh my god.

2060
03:10:51,549 --> 03:10:53,549
I'm gonna be stuck here.

2061
03:10:56,170 --> 03:11:00,969
Just slow it down. Don't have to go fast.

2062
03:11:15,180 --> 03:11:25,930
My tongue was out of my mouth that whole time.

2063
03:11:42,059 --> 03:11:45,000
No. I have to beat it. I have to.

2064
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
I can't not do this.

2065
03:12:05,450 --> 03:12:08,840
I'm gonna turn the voice off.

2066
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:10,840
I think I have to disable voice for this.

2067
03:12:30,139 --> 03:12:32,139
Don't go out of bounds. It's the ice.

2068
03:12:32,139 --> 03:12:36,040
Holy god.

2069
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:38,040
Oh, that sucks.

2070
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:41,690
That really sucks.

2071
03:12:41,690 --> 03:12:43,690
Going through that second semi, you gotta go fast

2072
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:45,690
enough and then there's the ice right there. You gotta...

2073
03:12:45,690 --> 03:12:47,930
I give up.

2074
03:12:47,930 --> 03:13:16,909
What the fuck?

2075
03:13:16,909 --> 03:13:18,909
You gotta go really fast through that

2076
03:13:18,909 --> 03:13:21,340
last screen. You have to

2077
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:23,340
lead that target too.

2078
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:25,340
I have to drive in a straight

2079
03:13:25,340 --> 03:13:27,340
line like 200 feet in front of that semi.

2080
03:13:35,209 --> 03:13:37,209
I can do it.

2081
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:53,709
Excuse me?

2082
03:13:53,709 --> 03:14:40,170
It didn't go fast

2083
03:14:40,170 --> 03:14:46,639
enough. I can't even get

2084
03:14:46,639 --> 03:15:01,100
through the first one anymore.

2085
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:03,100
That's

2086
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:06,670
insane.

2087
03:15:06,670 --> 03:15:10,569
That's insanity.

2088
03:15:10,569 --> 03:15:12,569
You just gotta get lucky to do this one.

2089
03:15:12,569 --> 03:15:17,309
I'll do it after like another

2090
03:15:17,309 --> 03:15:25,879
200 attempts.

2091
03:15:25,879 --> 03:16:02,409
There we go.

2092
03:16:17,209 --> 03:16:19,209
I can see it in chat and it's fucking

2093
03:16:19,209 --> 03:16:22,920
messing me up.

2094
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:24,920
Stop spamming. It hurts my eyes.

2095
03:16:24,920 --> 03:16:34,200
That's bullshit. I fucking drifted.

2096
03:16:34,200 --> 03:16:59,479
I can't...

2097
03:16:59,479 --> 03:17:01,479
I'm gonna have a fucking meltdown from this one.

2098
03:17:01,479 --> 03:17:04,299
You wanted

2099
03:17:04,299 --> 03:17:06,299
a meltdown? You might get one soon.

2100
03:17:06,299 --> 03:17:08,860
I don't know how much longer I can

2101
03:17:08,860 --> 03:17:25,370
handle this as a human.

2102
03:17:25,370 --> 03:17:27,370
Oh, please.

2103
03:17:27,370 --> 03:17:47,450
He's

2104
03:17:47,450 --> 03:17:49,450
under the semi. He's gotta control

2105
03:17:49,450 --> 03:17:54,700
this drift. I had

2106
03:17:54,700 --> 03:17:56,700
it too. That was the end. That's the turnaround.

2107
03:17:56,700 --> 03:18:04,120
What a good break from playing

2108
03:18:04,120 --> 03:18:06,120
the regular game to do like this

2109
03:18:06,120 --> 03:18:08,120
hard bullshit levels.

2110
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:10,120
This ain't even a commercial.

2111
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:19,469
I'm drifting in there. I am.

2112
03:18:19,469 --> 03:18:21,469
How do you expect somebody

2113
03:18:21,469 --> 03:18:24,090
to do that?

2114
03:18:24,090 --> 03:18:26,090
I'm drifting. And if I drift too much, I just

2115
03:18:26,090 --> 03:18:28,090
fly out of the goddamn playing area.

2116
03:18:28,090 --> 03:18:35,450
What are you on about,

2117
03:18:35,450 --> 03:18:37,450
game? How do you expect me to do

2118
03:18:37,450 --> 03:18:51,600
that? Oh my god!

2119
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:53,600
Oh my god!

2120
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:56,010
You see what I'm saying?

2121
03:18:56,010 --> 03:18:58,010
You see what I'm talking about, right? You understand.

2122
03:18:58,010 --> 03:19:02,940
You get it. You guys get

2123
03:19:02,940 --> 03:19:12,219
me. You do. You get me.

2124
03:19:12,219 --> 03:19:14,219
I know you guys always got my back.

2125
03:19:14,219 --> 03:19:35,790
I love just looking over here and just seeing everybody's

2126
03:19:35,790 --> 03:19:49,100
got my back here.

2127
03:19:49,100 --> 03:19:51,100
This music playing over and over again

2128
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:53,100
too is not helping.

2129
03:19:53,100 --> 03:20:21,370
Hey! What?

2130
03:20:21,370 --> 03:21:51,290
I turned it off.

2131
03:21:51,290 --> 03:21:53,290
Uhhhh!

2132
03:21:53,290 --> 03:21:55,920
Why?

2133
03:21:55,920 --> 03:22:28,489
It's so hard.

2134
03:22:28,489 --> 03:22:30,489
I gotta get it. I will. Eventually

2135
03:22:30,489 --> 03:22:36,000
it'll happen. Didn't even give me

2136
03:22:36,000 --> 03:23:34,620
them. It's actually

2137
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:36,620
impossible. It's impossible to do that. It's

2138
03:23:36,620 --> 03:23:38,620
not possible to do that last semi.

2139
03:23:38,620 --> 03:23:41,690
I don't think it is. I think this is a developer joke.

2140
03:23:41,690 --> 03:23:47,319
That's a developer joke.

2141
03:23:47,319 --> 03:23:53,209
Because you have to drift

2142
03:23:53,209 --> 03:23:55,209
out of that. And then

2143
03:23:55,209 --> 03:23:57,209
you can't straighten up yet. There's no

2144
03:23:57,209 --> 03:23:59,209
way. It's not possible.

2145
03:23:59,209 --> 03:24:05,930
It's a fucking developer joke. I'm gonna try

2146
03:24:05,930 --> 03:24:07,930
this one more.

2147
03:24:07,930 --> 03:24:11,899
I get further the quieter

2148
03:24:11,899 --> 03:24:35,899
this frame.

2149
03:24:35,899 --> 03:24:43,440
He's very

2150
03:24:43,440 --> 03:24:45,440

2151
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,440
He jumps on the trailer, then

2152
03:24:47,440 --> 03:24:49,440
down to the ice below.

2153
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:53,440
Can he hit everyone?

2154
03:24:53,440 --> 03:25:03,479

2155
03:25:03,479 --> 03:25:05,479

2157
03:25:09,479 --> 03:25:11,479

One. Action.

2159
03:25:22,959 --> 03:25:24,959
He jumps on the trailer,

2160
03:25:24,959 --> 03:25:26,959
then down to the ice below.

2161
03:25:26,959 --> 03:25:29,840
Can he hit everyone?

2162
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:37,389
He's gotta

2163
03:25:37,389 --> 03:25:39,389
control this drift. Can he make it

2164
03:25:39,389 --> 03:25:41,629
under the semi?

2165
03:25:41,629 --> 03:25:43,629

One. Action.

2168
03:26:19,639 --> 03:26:29,760
He jumps on the trailer, then

2169
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:31,760
down to the ice below.

2170
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:45,260
Can he make it under the

2171
03:26:45,260 --> 03:26:50,510
semi? Can he hit

2172
03:26:50,510 --> 03:26:53,770

He jumps on the trailer, then down to the ice below.

2175
03:27:22,780 --> 03:27:24,780
Can he hit everyone?

2176
03:27:24,780 --> 03:27:26,780

ambulance one or a firefighter one

2198

okay overdrive is a street crime movie set in today's San Francisco okay it's

2199

03:31:57,389 --> 03:32:01,469
the movie super big and awesome but it's not gonna fit on a poster okay all right

2203
03:32:01,469 --> 03:32:04,709
you're gonna be doubling for our hero stone okay all right now I want you got

that no lasers on the car no kangaroos that no Spanish okay that sounds like

2209
03:32:22,389 --> 03:32:27,069
the smash mouth leads there really unsafe with insane stunts as many as you can squeeze

2210
03:32:27,069 --> 03:32:30,870
together into one run okay so you get behind the wheel I'll get behind the

2211

2213
03:32:38,549 --> 03:32:43,110
don't ever do it kid all right okay let's talk about what you'll be facing

2214
03:32:43,110 --> 03:32:47,229
an overdrive kid character wise you'll mostly split your time between the loose

2215
03:32:47,229 --> 03:32:51,350
cannon cop stone and the ruthless drug lord Varga we'll have you in one scene

2216
03:32:51,350 --> 03:32:55,829
with a bulky fire engine that can cause serious damage two scenes with stones

2217
03:32:55,829 --> 03:33:00,110
custom-made muscle car the claw cool two scenes on a high-powered street bike

2218
03:33:00,110 --> 03:33:06,829
and one with the MVX Spartan a European sports I like that one the films said in

2219
03:33:06,829 --> 03:33:10,469
San Francisco with lots of steep hills and tight alleyways

2220
03:33:10,469 --> 03:33:13,829
Rodina was known for pushing the envelope in his action scenes so you'll

2221
03:33:13,829 --> 03:33:17,389
have your hands full with some complicated lines including a great

2222
03:33:17,389 --> 03:33:21,889
scene on a cargo ship and a massive jump from a parking garage roof that ends

2223
03:33:21,889 --> 03:33:26,549
with you smashing into a helicopter excited yet come on let's get to work

2224
03:33:26,549 --> 03:33:32,559
Rodina wants to start with the movies final chase you'll double for Vargas in

2225
03:33:32,559 --> 03:33:36,559
a hijacked firetruck there's a tricky line that starts with a drift left why

2226
03:33:36,559 --> 03:33:40,360
do I know what you mean the drift smooth you said this guy's sounds like

2227
03:33:40,360 --> 03:33:45,680
he's speaking from SUV as you exit the alleys other end then turn left plow

2228
03:33:45,680 --> 03:33:49,760
through the gas station and hit the semi I know what you mean by this crash to

2229
03:33:49,760 --> 03:33:55,040
stop the back end of the trailer not the middle it's that way you'll turn the

2230
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:58,120
trailer and keep barreling forward

2231
03:34:30,809 --> 03:34:36,049
I smashed into that that was a smash

2232
03:34:43,809 --> 03:35:05,520
I told you I was not having this thought

2233
03:35:12,989 --> 03:35:23,190
this is like going from toad to Bowser I play all I play with toad and Kuba

2234
03:35:23,190 --> 03:35:32,100
turbo I don't play with Donkey Kong Bowser and this is why I like that's

2235
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:37,100

2247
03:39:13,819 --> 03:39:48,559
end of the mission I'm dumb I thought I screwed something up this is makes me

2253
03:40:37,159 --> 03:40:41,040
get you to the trolley tracks really guess it so you can pass the first

2254
03:40:41,040 --> 03:40:45,319
trolley then turn quickly to the right to avoid crashing into the second trolley

03:51:25,250 --> 03:52:00,340
helicopter this all happens very quickly so it's gonna be about that's a really

2287
03:52:00,340 --> 03:52:27,629
hard left bad what that was good I couldn't control

2288
03:52:35,530 --> 03:52:41,479
okay I don't want to hold on I think you see what happens

2289
03:52:41,479 --> 03:53:05,200
ready that doesn't it doesn't matter it doesn't just kill you

2290
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:29,309
action through the gap cleaner than action through the gap trolley red the

2291
03:53:29,309 --> 03:54:00,030
needle well still got it in here I go geez into the trolley wheelie sorry why

2292
03:54:00,030 --> 03:54:22,920
am I apologizing I'm sorry guys cut me off I'm sorry I got it I can do it

2293
03:54:22,920 --> 03:54:40,120
oh shit where where's the next part

2294
03:55:13,760 --> 03:55:19,940
where did it all go so wrong I didn't get hit by that which I

2295
03:55:19,940 --> 03:55:32,809
almost did and then what happens that's this is fine that was done fine where

2296
03:55:32,809 --> 03:55:35,809
does this go so wrong

2297
03:56:11,159 --> 03:56:28,079
oh sorry screaming there's too much but really though how are you supposed to go

2298
03:56:28,079 --> 03:56:48,159
up there go through the window in the jump leads you right into the wall okay

2299
03:56:48,159 --> 03:56:57,010
oh hold on okay I'm gonna try this again

2300
03:57:09,840 --> 03:57:20,750
over the trolley over the trolley come on that can't take on the left it's

2301
03:57:20,750 --> 03:57:44,750
all right I still get three stars good really I get it I didn't know I had to

2302
03:57:44,750 --> 03:58:25,500
do that did it what window I have to move on I have to get out of here before I die

2303
03:58:25,500 --> 03:58:33,940
that's slumping back into the seat because I got you getting an accident

2304
03:58:33,940 --> 03:58:38,459
and the accident doesn't make you fall off the bike just delayed reaction a

2305
03:58:38,459 --> 03:58:42,260
few seconds later you fall backwards you just pass out from the extreme

2306
03:58:42,260 --> 03:58:56,190
stress of the situation but you can't believe you're still alive and you faint

2307
03:58:56,190 --> 03:59:10,209
I didn't get it I've made that on the back tire though where's the panic try

2308
03:59:10,209 --> 03:59:15,319
to do the objective is coming up here go through the trolleys oh shit I'm gonna

2309
03:59:15,319 --> 03:59:39,020
just hurt myself to do this here it comes what was that I made it through

2310
03:59:39,020 --> 03:59:47,819
though I may have like skinned my whole body but I made it through I hope that

2311
03:59:47,819 --> 03:59:52,379
makes it into the trailer please have one of those make it into the trailer

2312
03:59:52,379 --> 04:00:09,329
you know this AI in the algorithm here is gonna pull a random scene with

2313
04:00:09,329 --> 04:00:14,620
something like that happens it's gonna be so funny in this scene you'll play

2314
04:00:14,620 --> 04:00:19,079
stone again as he's ambushed by SUV driving hit squads the feature stunt

2315
04:00:19,079 --> 04:00:24,159
will be a reverse 180 getaway you'll turn into a narrow alley then two SUVs

2316
04:00:24,159 --> 04:00:29,000
will block your path slam on the brakes and reverse back the way you came as you

2317
04:00:29,040 --> 04:00:32,799
enter the main street spin the car all the way around so you can drive forward

2318
04:00:32,799 --> 04:00:36,239
into the next alley and escape your pursuers you know what Rodino said

2319
04:00:36,239 --> 04:00:41,399
about making stone tough this is your last shot to give him some balls

2320
04:00:43,559 --> 04:00:55,010
pre-rendered a million points this is the real deal

2321
04:00:55,610 --> 04:01:57,280
oh I thought I had to turn right apparently not for the glass what I got

2322
04:01:57,280 --> 04:02:40,000
it yep the gap yeah I did it nope don't happen not happening

2323
04:02:40,559 --> 04:03:25,870
then I go too high no he knocked me over action was do that's not bad I got

2324
04:03:25,870 --> 04:03:34,190
did you see what happened that guy watch this replay the first car and that was

2325
04:03:34,190 --> 04:03:41,440
explosion they can't be a human in there watch how fast this gets ripped off the

2326
04:03:41,440 --> 04:04:11,319
screen beginning wasn't that bad that was bad placement their RNG placement

2327
04:04:11,319 --> 04:04:49,379
where that was gonna land physics-based what oh that was good

2328
04:04:49,379 --> 04:05:03,969
tell I wanted to go right there but yeah there that yeah I'll take that over the

2329
04:05:03,969 --> 04:05:27,750
original should get some style points there three three three this is called

2330
04:05:27,750 --> 04:05:33,190
snitch this scene happens at the start of the movie when stone chases down a

2331
04:05:33,190 --> 04:05:37,829
bike pump who's hopped up on Vargas new drug you'll double for the pump the key

2332
04:05:37,829 --> 04:05:42,270
to this run is another well-timed slide after a hard drift right you'll

2333
04:05:42,270 --> 04:05:47,149
accelerate up a steep street and pass close to a police car then you'll slide

2334
04:05:47,149 --> 04:05:51,350
to dodge beneath another cop car as it comes over the hill and flies straight

2335
04:05:51,350 --> 04:05:55,110
toward you the vehicle could take your head off so be careful and make sure you

2336
04:05:56,110 --> 04:05:58,110
trying to do that though

2337
04:06:02,909 --> 04:06:09,690
this one sounds hard

2338
04:06:16,399 --> 04:06:30,600
oh shit

2339
04:06:48,309 --> 04:07:12,500
hey oh well I didn't even like see it all right

2340
04:07:13,500 --> 04:07:23,610
I don't

2341
04:07:41,809 --> 04:07:52,940
it's okay you gotta go you gotta hug the left side

2342
04:08:11,239 --> 04:08:28,680
good physics made no sense there

2343
04:08:29,680 --> 04:08:49,879
the person's still in there what what

2344
04:08:58,110 --> 04:09:16,620
tells me that should not have been like that

2345
04:09:17,620 --> 04:09:26,920
I fell down like four times like that view

2346
04:09:26,920 --> 04:09:59,979
I'll fix it

2347
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:37,840
nothing about that seemed correct thank you gnarly for the five minute subs

2348
04:10:37,840 --> 04:10:45,680
came in right there a minute ago thank you gnarly five subs bring to the final

2349
04:10:45,680 --> 04:10:51,879
mission of overdrive how do I get four on this and not four on this one or this

2350
04:10:51,879 --> 04:10:57,440
one all right this is the super fast car in this scene you'll play a stone whose

2351
04:10:57,440 --> 04:11:02,440
commandeered Vargas is prized European sports car the MVX Spartan the major

2352
04:11:02,440 --> 04:11:07,440
stunt comes at the end you'll shoot across two rooftops then take a huge jump

2353
04:11:07,440 --> 04:11:11,440
and smash into a helicopter in mid-flight you'll need to gun it going

2354
04:11:11,440 --> 04:11:15,440
into your first jump or you won't have enough speed make sure you're lined up

2355
04:11:15,440 --> 04:11:19,440
and throttle it hard the rest of the way trust me kid pull this off and you'll

2356
04:11:19,440 --> 04:11:22,440
have some serious bragging rights

2357
04:11:22,440 --> 04:11:56,270

I get it shit that ain't gonna happen

2360
04:12:57,649 --> 04:13:19,489
what happened in the beginning so it's go back and then do a 180 but then what

2361
04:13:19,489 --> 04:14:17,930
and then turn back around that's holy shit this car's fast hence I'm ready

2365
04:16:17,399 --> 04:17:13,610
reverse through under the semi guys through again

2366
04:17:13,610 --> 04:17:46,229
I'm not flipping that SUV I'm just touching my god use action I got it

2394
04:31:46,469 --> 04:31:53,440
I have to drift into like a toilet bowl no way you can do that perfectly

2395
04:31:53,639 --> 04:32:38,239

meltdown it's gonna happen I didn't think it was gonna happen tonight but

2399
04:33:40,759 --> 04:33:46,200
it might I just I have it so close it's so close guys it's so close to me like

2400
04:33:46,200 --> 04:33:50,479
more than three don't worry it's everything's fine just remember every

2401
04:33:50,479 --> 04:33:53,060
time you're about to have a meltdown about like a ten-year-old video man

2402
04:33:53,060 --> 04:33:57,900
remember you're 33 you know it's like not properly so I'm fine everything's

2403
04:33:57,900 --> 04:34:02,779
fine you know I'm like I'm in my 30s you know you don't do that well I didn't get

2404
04:34:02,779 --> 04:34:06,819
the right piece of candy at the candy store everything's fine I'm a grown man

2405
04:34:06,819 --> 04:34:10,979
grown men don't get angry at things like this they get they get they did they

2406
04:34:10,979 --> 04:34:36,580
worry about like taxes and there's a gap where it's not really feasible to keep

2407
04:34:36,580 --> 04:34:58,240
the string going there drive me I know you have to drive near cars but when I

2408
04:34:58,240 --> 04:35:05,139
had okay so this taxi right here right there's an explosion and then I I'm

2409
04:35:05,139 --> 04:35:10,619
driving close to this car driving close to this car and then check this out got

2410
04:35:10,619 --> 04:35:29,099
it doesn't matter just keep going you get points for running people over

2411
04:35:29,099 --> 04:36:37,700
nothing out there was nothing for me to string together to fucking 95 let's

2412
04:36:37,700 --> 04:36:56,180
watch I'm gonna go like scream and he's stone and he's a tough cop with an

2413
04:36:56,180 --> 04:36:58,180
attitude

2414
04:37:01,220 --> 04:37:08,979
and he's after this man Varga a vicious drug lord with a sick taste of violence

2415
04:37:08,979 --> 04:37:16,540
pretty kitty when the new designer drug gristle hits the streets the death toll

2416
04:37:16,619 --> 04:37:21,299
rises daily one man's rage can only boil for so long

2417
04:37:21,299 --> 04:37:24,299
till he explodes

2418
04:37:33,340 --> 04:37:40,509
bloody fists and a few marble short stuff will stop at nothing to get barged

2419
04:37:40,509 --> 04:37:45,430
off the streets forever it's loose cannon versus loose

2420
04:37:45,430 --> 04:38:02,139
cannon instead one man fall that didn't happen don't do drugs

2421
04:38:02,139 --> 04:38:17,540
overdrive rated R pretty rendered pretty rendered all right that was fun that

2422
04:38:17,540 --> 04:38:22,259
was cool this next one is called never kill me again and then we have night

2423
04:38:22,259 --> 04:38:34,580
Avenger we also have this final job here which is delivery commercial this is a

2424
04:38:34,580 --> 04:38:38,159
commercial for tick-tock delivery service you'll be driving through the

2425
04:38:38,159 --> 04:38:41,779
set of aftershock and taking out the competitor delivery trucks along the

2426
04:38:41,779 --> 04:38:46,419
way the concept is that even in the midst of a volcanic eruption tick-tock

2427
04:38:46,419 --> 04:38:51,619
delivers on time your big stunt is the pipe ramp keep in mind this is a heavy

2428
04:38:51,619 --> 04:38:55,540
vehicle so it'll take longer for the truck to rotate in the air land

2429
04:38:55,619 --> 04:39:06,970
straight then continue your run through the ravaged town tick-tock master

2430
04:39:06,970 --> 04:39:16,490
freight hundred and ten thousand two one action

2431
04:39:16,490 --> 04:39:25,900
straight the truck

2432
04:39:28,939 --> 04:39:42,150
great this one too oh too much first

2433
04:39:42,150 --> 04:39:50,009
cut no mistakes next time oh there's a huge huge turn but I have to be careful

2434
04:39:50,209 --> 04:39:54,009
three two one action

2435
04:39:54,009 --> 04:40:25,759
scrape the truck drift turn right I get the first three two one action

2436
04:40:25,759 --> 04:40:58,060
great the truck oh come on I'm over it come on great the truck

2437
04:40:58,060 --> 04:41:17,490
yeah I'm here and scrape it easy this one great

series with a post post-modern mise-en-scène we will delve into the inner

2461
04:45:05,000 --> 04:45:10,159
psyche of our hero outside he is shooting wristwatch missiles avoiding

2462
04:45:10,159 --> 04:45:15,279
crotch table saws making big-breasted women moan with animal pleasure but

2463
04:45:15,279 --> 04:45:19,639
inside he is spitting at the gods despairing over the absurdity of

2464
04:45:19,759 --> 04:45:26,880
existence this bar I know I know you are thinking oh this is a spy blockbuster I

2465
04:45:26,880 --> 04:45:30,880
do not see how you can make it out that is because you are a simple man who

2466
04:45:30,880 --> 04:45:35,959
lives by his calloused gorilla hands and not his mind no offense okay out of my

2467

rival spy the feature stunt happens on a bridge take out a couple cars then take

2472
04:46:03,860 --> 04:46:07,900
the ramp onto the bridge railing the trick is to keep yourself mostly

2473
04:46:07,900 --> 04:46:12,939
parallel to the railing when you jump don't go too fast or turn too sharp on

2474
04:46:12,939 --> 04:46:16,500
the railing overshoot and crash into the ravine

2475
04:46:16,500 --> 04:46:21,740

everywhere it's all right

2483
04:49:44,549 --> 04:49:50,389
okay that seems like it was a cross up there

2484
04:49:52,630 --> 04:50:05,979
all right part of me thinks I'm playing an action game

2485
04:50:10,220 --> 04:50:45,819

faster

2488
04:51:47,799 --> 04:52:00,310
stupid-ass no I the snow just killed it's like times 10

2489
04:52:00,310 --> 04:52:10,630
action you land on the snow and you may as well just drift into the fucking wall

2490
04:52:11,509 --> 04:52:39,709
I'm holding that one part right there to delete it from him action delete that

2491
04:52:39,709 --> 04:52:42,950

barely that director commentary here while I was on this bike I had almost no

2497
04:54:46,709 --> 04:54:50,630
control of this the director actually told me just close your eyes when you do

2498
04:54:50,630 --> 04:54:54,029
this part because you may as well it's gonna be the same thing whether or not

2499
04:54:54,029 --> 04:55:06,299
you open or close your eyes so I was like yeah you know that makes sense he's

2506
04:55:35,610 --> 04:55:39,889

2507
04:55:39,889 --> 04:56:00,150
avoid the falling road keep up with the lead you're gonna rush this guy spy if

2508

2534
05:08:06,860 --> 05:08:53,599
Hollywood again it's alright this is possible still there's no fucking way I

2535

up on two wheels and do this fuck that level next you'll double for crown as

2537
05:09:43,509 --> 05:09:47,950
he chases his rival over a frozen lake there's a tricky line as you exit the

2538
05:09:47,950 --> 05:09:52,110
base jump onto the roof then keep gunning it as you make the second jump

2539
05:09:52,110 --> 05:09:57,069
over the base wall soon as you land hit your nitrous switch and speed through

2540
05:09:57,069 --> 05:10:01,590
the narrow pass ending with a big jump over ravine you'll be going too fast for

2541
05:10:01,590 --> 05:10:12,680
big turns so pick your line early and only make small adjustments not

2542
05:10:12,680 --> 05:10:33,150
complete it didn't finish right through here Jesus around again in a circle

2543
05:10:33,150 --> 05:10:47,439

2546
05:11:54,330 --> 05:12:11,389
slippery I technically did it it's all right I I did it I technically drifted

2547
05:12:11,430 --> 05:13:08,380
in the right spot I wouldn't be that bad I can't talk now where down here I got a

2548

2550
05:13:47,080 --> 05:14:15,979
car I could take like one or two ice levels you can't have a whole zone based

2551
05:14:16,099 --> 05:14:49,560
around ice levels I'm sorry I just want to finish the damn thing trying oh you've

2552
05:14:49,560 --> 05:14:54,919

2554
05:15:01,590 --> 05:15:15,959
you look at it I went faster on the rebound there than I did in holding down

2555
05:15:15,959 --> 05:15:30,220
acceleration and snow this is a Mario maker loving this is I played this one

2556
05:15:30,220 --> 05:15:52,889
already and I'm not gonna lie I really think I could control a car better than

2557
05:15:52,889 --> 05:15:58,400
this in real life on a full ice lake it's like they dialed up the slipperiness

2558
05:15:58,400 --> 05:16:31,299
by like six hundred percent just paved the fucking road can I get a road paver

2559

be turned so you have to be but you need speed it's harder than secure how many

2589
05:25:30,340 --> 05:25:42,340
attempts is this how many times did I do the final boss in secure 57 this is like

2590
05:25:42,540 --> 05:25:46,340
attempt number like 30 or 40 at least right and why did I didn't land in the

2591
05:25:46,340 --> 05:26:33,150
box I guess cleaning in now you got I got gamer neck right now I'm leaning in

sweating

2597
05:28:27,689 --> 05:28:32,009
next level is worse next to where I had I hated this one next one is worse next

2598
05:28:32,009 --> 05:28:34,290
one's worse

2599
05:28:34,290 --> 05:28:38,569
as a chopper smashes into it fire missiles at the clips and knock some

2600
05:28:38,569 --> 05:30:07,560
glaciers into grounds okay 180 on ice too much too I can't imagine making

2601
05:30:07,560 --> 05:30:11,909
these levels even playing them and being like yeah people will like this this is

2602
05:30:11,909 --> 05:30:21,880
good anybody in the studio have any fucking hair left oh no it's all patchy

want to get to the end of this visit level I'm gonna do whatever it takes to

2609
05:32:36,799 --> 05:33:06,439
just get like 10 points who cares no what a spy would not drive on ice he

2610
05:33:06,439 --> 05:33:11,080
would get a fucking ice pick goggles and a ski mask and he would climb the damn

2611
05:33:11,080 --> 05:33:15,279
mountain and bring a tent and shit and that's how we would infiltrate that's

2612
05:33:15,279 --> 05:33:19,580
how we would get away because he'd be smart he wouldn't be stupid and drive

2613
05:33:19,580 --> 05:33:32,700
like 80 on fucking ice James Bond didn't do this it was smarter than that and why

2614
05:33:32,700 --> 05:33:43,400
is your entire base made out of ice where is this supposed to be where it

2615
05:33:43,400 --> 05:34:05,439
why is this here there's a base here nobody can try fun yeah even they can't

2616
05:34:05,439 --> 05:34:14,159
drive on the setting of Goldeneye gold he's the keys the ski jumper whatever

2620
05:34:57,560 --> 05:35:41,029
whole thing have to be ice the whole course Sonic racers didn't even have this

2621
05:35:41,029 --> 05:35:47,270
shit Mario Kart doesn't even have a level like this across the entire like 16

2622
05:35:47,270 --> 05:36:20,180
Mario Kart games cartoons don't even have this shit no I don't want to watch

2624
05:36:26,740 --> 05:36:39,189
place I'm waiting for like the guy to come out of the closet with a camera hey

we just want to let you know we got you our streamers get bad that whole ice

2626
05:36:44,400 --> 05:36:47,520
level the whole thing was made from the ground up just to fuck with you really

2627
05:36:47,520 --> 05:36:54,000
no way yeah I mean it's such a dogshit level the whole thing so it's not real

2628
05:36:54,000 --> 05:36:58,970
look over there there's a camera over there too oh in the corner no way how

2629
05:36:58,970 --> 05:37:16,419
long has it been there for you know a few months oh okay we don't keep any

2630
05:37:16,419 --> 05:37:35,619
other footage that we've recorded don't worry please just get me to the end I

2631
05:37:35,619 --> 05:37:47,240
just please get me to the end of this level this not a chance and help that

2632
05:37:47,240 --> 05:38:29,830
you can do that what 180 and then reverse just want to get to the end I

2633
05:38:29,830 --> 05:38:33,069
just want to get to the end I don't care about anything I just want to get to the

2634
05:38:33,069 --> 05:38:48,040
end I just want to get to the end this doesn't look fun oh I can tell you with

2635
05:38:48,040 --> 05:38:53,959
a hundred percent certainty it isn't so don't worry about that it doesn't look

2636
05:38:53,959 --> 05:39:18,610
like that because it isn't touch play operation with the cars too what's up

2637
05:39:18,650 --> 05:39:45,740
with that oh worse manure you gotta play operation with the cars on ice put on

2638
05:39:45,740 --> 05:39:54,580
easy there are no difficulties of this game this only ice there's just ice

2639
05:39:54,580 --> 05:40:02,549
there's nothing on you got ice and then you got a car there's no other there's

2640
05:40:02,750 --> 05:40:44,080
only one difficulty it's ice has anybody completed this fucking game can I look

2641
05:40:44,080 --> 05:40:56,560
at like the global trophies have more people beat orphan that have done this

2642
05:40:56,560 --> 05:41:01,770
level I can't imagine fucking just playing this casually and then going

2643
05:41:01,770 --> 05:41:33,580
like well I'll never do this again like that guy like that one guy earlier all

2644
05:41:33,619 --> 05:41:38,630
right let this be like a game design 101 lesson for you guys this is how you get

2645
05:41:38,630 --> 05:41:46,310
people to break their discs you make a whole entire area based on slippery ice

2646
05:41:46,310 --> 05:42:14,779
in a driving game what is I want to know what the last mission is here does the

2647
05:42:14,779 --> 05:42:25,400
game uninstall itself after this part slowing down doesn't help because you

2648
05:42:25,400 --> 05:43:23,770
need to get there in a certain amount of time no operation oh my god no no

2649
05:43:24,130 --> 05:43:41,619
no no I'm gonna skip this level I would rather no nevermind I can't even I can't

2650
05:43:41,619 --> 05:43:51,979
even give you a reason to have this what's the last area what it has to be

2651
05:43:51,979 --> 05:44:01,150
like did they just go back to like formula this is out fucking rages

2652
05:44:01,150 --> 05:44:25,340
you can't imagine doing this on ps2 oh my god no way this there was a lot of sad

2653
05:44:25,340 --> 05:44:31,389
kids when this came out people were probably crying I imagine myself tears

2654
05:44:31,389 --> 05:44:46,970
screaming down my eyes crying as like at like 17 and whatever so the handbrake

2655
05:44:46,970 --> 05:44:55,619
just slides you across the whole entire map this is it for this month I'm

2656
05:44:55,619 --> 05:45:35,049
skipping this level I'll come back to it god just get up there how much how far

2657
05:45:35,049 --> 05:45:53,740
you have to reverse hey can I tell you this I'm bad at the game joke is and I

2658
05:45:53,740 --> 05:46:03,979
got four stars oh get out of here this bad at the game joking needs to stop

2659
05:46:03,979 --> 05:46:57,380
stop leave me alone I hope the next area is you run don't have a car I clearly

2660
05:46:57,380 --> 05:47:19,409
had no idea what I was doing here and that holy shit there's more oh no oh no

2661
05:47:19,409 --> 05:47:23,229
okay fresh start

2662
05:47:42,270 --> 05:47:55,279
no I'm gonna relax we're just gonna relax and I'm gonna get it done just

2663
05:47:55,279 --> 05:48:00,549
calm down and play right just play it that's all right nothing there's no

2664
05:48:00,549 --> 05:48:33,529
problem just relax that's all right it's okay I wasn't supposed to do that I'm

2665
05:48:33,529 --> 05:49:16,220
supposed to do it like that this one is just a mess okay no I'm fine scrape this

2666
05:49:16,220 --> 05:49:27,400
guy does he that he already got scraped actually did that all right I can do

2667
05:49:27,400 --> 05:50:01,220
this he was a ghost he was a ghost he was a ghost I had that too I actually

2668
05:50:01,220 --> 05:50:34,860
had that I didn't miss replay that all right let's go melt downstream melt

2669
05:50:34,860 --> 05:51:17,099
downstream melt downstream melt downstream that was two wheels wasn't

2670
05:51:17,099 --> 05:52:00,990
very long but it was two wheels oh that's fine I don't care what it is that

2671
05:52:01,990 --> 05:52:21,880
like the wise words of vault boy says good enough wise words I don't want to

2672
05:52:21,880 --> 05:52:38,970
see the replay either it's like across the room oh no no no no easy easy if I

2673
05:52:38,970 --> 05:52:47,900
accidentally click a few buttons I might stop screaming what was I trying to do

2674
05:52:47,900 --> 05:52:52,630
with this I don't remember all right this next one's a hovercraft this is the

2675
05:52:52,630 --> 05:53:15,020
final one wait did I just give myself a debuff a hundred percent more

2676
05:53:15,020 --> 05:53:49,099
slipperiness that's okay I got it we're gonna it's it's too light to cause

2677
05:53:49,099 --> 05:53:57,529
screams you know I mean I got it all out of me I'm not upset at anything and that

2678
05:53:57,569 --> 05:54:13,529
is a fun level I'm just gonna do it why the arrows are pointing in almost every

2679
05:54:13,529 --> 05:55:09,439
direction that's a jump on the wreckage up here oh hard very hard that one get

2680
05:55:09,439 --> 05:55:34,639
in that box and then inside the box unbelievable that's in the box whatever

2681
05:55:34,959 --> 05:55:53,299
just get in the box just get in the box just go into the box we still have one

2682
05:55:53,299 --> 05:56:06,840
more area after this and I'm I accepted with open arms the only way they would

2683
05:56:06,840 --> 05:56:10,240
make this worse was it was like anti-gravity like with the spaceship for

2684
05:56:10,240 --> 05:56:47,369
the next stunt so anti-climactic going over this every time okay almost there

2685
05:56:47,369 --> 05:57:14,819
all right into the box here we go line it up there we go that's it it's in that

2686
05:57:14,819 --> 05:57:36,790
was not even remotely as bad as that third level just watch the movie night

2687
05:57:36,790 --> 05:58:31,189
Avenger unlocked so the last area coming up I'm almost done with the game if this

2688
05:58:31,189 --> 05:58:40,419
movie has more than 12% on rotten tomatoes I'll eat a pair of shoes the

2689
05:58:40,419 --> 05:59:12,939
whole thing I'm gonna check it I'm not even in this movie yeah all right guys

right huge comic book well we're making that fan screamed for it for years but

2696
05:59:44,400 --> 05:59:47,759
it was trapped in development hell when I told pyramid I wanted it they've shown

2697
05:59:47,759 --> 05:59:52,439
up with me I've got Murphy on the line sir great tell him I'll call him back in

2698
05:59:52,439 --> 05:59:57,279
40 seconds you've got a decent resume after shock overdrive whooping to ride

2699
05:59:57,279 --> 06:00:01,799
that Baxter screw up and his friends what a mess can't believe it grows 200

2700
06:00:01,799 --> 06:00:06,680
mil mr. Wrightman's last film gross 600 that's true sir she's great with numbers

2701
06:00:06,680 --> 06:00:10,400
wardrobe's got a problem latex suits sir too much well I just lost in snakes

2702
06:00:10,400 --> 06:00:14,279
versus my guy next to me my friend the jokes are fucking empty at moment I'm

2703
06:00:14,279 --> 06:00:17,919
sorry I'll make sure you're known as the best in the world let me down and well

2704
06:00:17,919 --> 06:00:21,759
Jack here he was directing summer blockbusters before he got on my bad

2705
06:00:21,759 --> 06:00:25,720
side but now we get along splendidly right Jack you're incredible mr.

2706
06:00:25,720 --> 06:00:30,360
Wrightman see you on set it's like we'll not rewind that like make it funnier

2707
06:00:30,360 --> 06:00:35,560
snake you've come in this first scene you'll double for night Avenger when he

2708
06:00:35,560 --> 06:00:40,680
spots Big Top's gang on a crime spree the focus stunt is an aerial gap through

2709
06:00:40,680 --> 06:00:45,080
the open doors of a helicopter jump across the rooftops fire your weapon then

2710
06:00:45,119 --> 06:00:49,479
get up to maximum speed to take the ramp oh after you've gapped through the

2711
06:00:49,479 --> 06:00:53,360
helicopter and land yeah you'll need to react quickly to avoid traffic and cross

2712
06:00:53,360 --> 06:01:05,189
to the other side of the street I get to wear the suit too nice I don't think I

2713
06:01:05,189 --> 06:01:37,459
could get angry here cuz I get to win I thought that was gonna happen much

2714
06:01:37,459 --> 06:01:58,639
earlier I thought I was gonna be this one here this other cop did it nominated

2715
06:01:58,639 --> 06:02:27,220
for an Emmy really that's so stupid you can't you try action

2716
06:02:27,220 --> 06:03:53,279
Avengers no I just barely made it I can't not a time what do I do that was

2717
06:03:53,279 --> 06:04:04,500
pretty cool I'm okay with two stars at the end tonight here let's watch that one

2718
06:04:04,500 --> 06:04:28,520
so I failed that one collectively come together and find out what

2719
06:04:28,959 --> 06:04:48,189
because you're bald oh all right yeah that makes sense

2720
06:04:48,189 --> 06:05:37,849
yeah like a college film what's next scene I was more like I love the bike

2721
06:05:37,849 --> 06:05:44,979
it is all right you'll double as Night Avenger again trying to stop Big Top

2722
06:05:44,979 --> 06:05:49,459
from killing the mayor the toughest stunt is early in the run take a sharp

2723
06:05:49,459 --> 06:05:53,900
left turn then line up to go beneath the semi trailer with enough speed to jump

2724
06:05:53,939 --> 06:05:58,619
over the cop cars right after then cross to the next stunt box and fire at Big

2725
06:05:58,619 --> 06:06:06,340
Top's henchmen and wipe them out did I tell you that I know Frank Jones the

2726
06:06:06,340 --> 06:06:11,180
leader of the camera he got most of his ideas from me did I tell you that I knew

2727
06:06:11,180 --> 06:06:42,569
okay I'm doing fine um what we talking about I'm right behind him I'm right

2728
06:06:42,569 --> 06:07:27,819
behind him I was going the right way and then you drop the cop car on me and it

2729
06:07:27,819 --> 06:07:35,909
didn't knock me off the bike and put me on the other side of the road honestly he

2730
06:07:35,909 --> 06:07:45,240
might just say at this point try not to die don't die careful don't die this

2731
06:07:45,240 --> 06:08:37,430
will kill you trying to kill you first attempt looked fantastic yeah

2732
06:08:37,430 --> 06:08:48,950
unfortunately see if they edited it up in post edited it edited it edited it

2733
06:08:48,950 --> 06:09:03,380
that is right that's correct somewhere is this Night Avenger or tactical

2734
06:09:03,380 --> 06:09:28,599
intervention they seem to share the same similarities here clown car now

2735
06:09:28,599 --> 06:09:32,240
you'll shoot the other side of the chase where Big Top is going after the mayor

2736
06:09:32,240 --> 06:09:37,040
this time you'll play Big Top the focus is a two-wheeling stunt you'll hit the

2737
06:09:37,040 --> 06:09:41,119
ramp with your driver's side as the tunnel bends to the left make sure

2738
06:09:41,119 --> 06:09:44,599
you're in control when you hit the ramp you're sliding all over the place you'll

2739
06:09:44,599 --> 06:09:48,759
mess up the stunt to wheel it through the zone and a pair of vehicles will fly

2740
06:09:48,759 --> 06:10:02,689
right over your head my character didn't lose all of his hair

2741
06:10:02,689 --> 06:11:37,200
one car fuck wait did he say you hit the mayor watch out you hit the mayor

2742
06:11:37,639 --> 06:12:17,220
what is he doing here it's a dangerous set man fucking usable but it's not my

2743
06:12:17,220 --> 06:12:26,520
stomach god damn it you keep that if you have the two or three days left of

2744
06:12:26,520 --> 06:12:35,240
principal photography we got like four hours left to close principal into the

2745
06:12:35,240 --> 06:12:38,799
city's water supply we take the fuck out of here come to the pier drift hard left

2746
06:12:38,799 --> 06:12:42,759
to fishtail and knock the police car into the water then speed along the

2747
06:12:43,200 --> 06:12:48,080
jump over the water and while you're airborne drop the bounce bomb drift

2748
06:12:48,080 --> 06:13:32,759
right when you land and continue your run watch out for the toys great the

2749
06:13:32,759 --> 06:13:37,979
police car but there was no turn

2750
06:14:11,029 --> 06:14:56,869
throwing overtake here you're supposed to be the best oh no you hit the mayor

2751
06:14:56,869 --> 06:15:20,020
again boomer reflexes it is exploding I did I did every I drove long ways

2752
06:15:20,020 --> 06:15:46,970
against the railing just restarted I went through it I've been in constant

2753
06:15:46,970 --> 06:15:56,180
fucking like laughter this constant stress this whole stream it's been just

2754
06:15:56,180 --> 06:16:00,259
if it's not like stomach stress from laughing it's just like I stress

2755
06:16:00,259 --> 06:16:55,049
constant comment oh there's not a okay I thought those water what oh into the

2756
06:16:55,049 --> 06:16:57,369
building into the building do we really do a wheelie

2757
06:16:57,490 --> 06:18:46,250
both the explosion I did all the ice cream truck where three last two levels

2758
06:18:46,250 --> 06:19:39,400
last for the campaign I think so the two back wheels there sloppy you could

2759
06:19:39,400 --> 06:19:42,599
probably five star on the first speed like I would destroy the first few

2760
06:19:43,000 --> 06:20:17,840
we'll see how much I've improved I'll go back and just do the first few let's go

2761
06:20:17,840 --> 06:20:23,270
only two remain this is with Batmobile and this is the both last two with the

2762
06:20:23,270 --> 06:20:28,639
Batmobile now you'll double as night Avenger chasing big top in the climax

2763
06:20:28,639 --> 06:20:33,360
this focus done is a jump onto elevated train tracks while you're on the roof

2764
06:20:33,360 --> 06:20:38,400
accelerate to crash into a big top helicopter and land on the L hit the

2765
06:20:38,400 --> 06:20:41,520
copter at an angle so you'll be prepared to turn right when you land

2766
06:20:41,520 --> 06:20:45,959
overtake the first train on the left side then veer to the right to avoid the

2767
06:20:45,959 --> 06:20:51,319
second oncoming train this is gonna this is gonna take a few tries I think

2768
06:20:51,319 --> 06:21:21,630
there's almost a million points you told me to kill that guy I what do you mean

2769
06:21:21,630 --> 06:23:34,880
I'm good let me see let me see it I can do it let me see if I can do it

2770
06:23:34,880 --> 06:24:12,000
let me see if I get enough speed going down I don't have to do it like I don't

2771
06:24:12,040 --> 06:24:17,119
have to do it like this why am I doing it the same way I did before here we go

2772
06:24:17,119 --> 06:24:49,740
fuck come on that had to be close that had to be close going through backwards

2773
06:24:49,740 --> 06:25:35,720
would be so awesome I can do it no it would do that that would be before

2774
06:25:36,080 --> 06:26:47,770
it's five minutes by this game is insane what I pressed it it has to happen

2775
06:26:47,849 --> 06:27:03,240
man oh god

2776
06:27:03,240 --> 06:27:39,090
Simpson's hit and run

2777
06:27:39,090 --> 06:27:42,290
Simpson's hit and run

2778
06:27:42,290 --> 06:27:44,290
I'm fucking getting trash bags

2779
06:27:44,290 --> 06:27:50,319
with the green shit all over the ground

2780
06:27:50,319 --> 06:27:52,560
3,2,1 action

2781
06:27:52,560 --> 06:27:57,360
good action

2782
06:27:57,360 --> 06:28:04,520
alright I'm good

2783
06:28:04,520 --> 06:28:12,200
perfect

2784
06:28:12,200 --> 06:28:30,680
five stars let's see it

2785
06:28:30,680 --> 06:28:34,709
oh fuck

2786
06:28:34,709 --> 06:28:45,759
I can make it I can make it I can make it

2787
06:28:45,840 --> 06:28:48,279
I can make it I can make it I can make it

2788
06:28:48,279 --> 06:28:50,279
I'm still on I'm still on

2789
06:28:50,279 --> 06:28:52,279
I got it twice

2790
06:28:58,639 --> 06:29:00,639
oh no

2791
06:29:00,639 --> 06:29:03,139
I got it

2792
06:29:03,139 --> 06:29:08,069
seriously

2793
06:29:08,069 --> 06:29:17,860
look at how good this was

2794
06:29:17,860 --> 06:29:19,860
I was still on the track too I could have made it

2795
06:29:19,860 --> 06:29:28,560
or something

2796
06:29:28,560 --> 06:29:30,560
I cleaned this up good too look at this turn

2797
06:29:30,560 --> 06:29:32,560
that looks so nice

2798
06:29:32,639 --> 06:29:58,400
I got something to say

2799
06:29:58,400 --> 06:30:00,400
for all the stuff that Batman does

2800
06:30:00,400 --> 06:30:02,400
and all the crazy shit you see

2801
06:30:02,400 --> 06:30:04,400
and like oh in this

2802
06:30:04,400 --> 06:30:06,400
car racing movie

2803
06:30:06,400 --> 06:30:08,400
or this game or Batman

2804
06:30:08,400 --> 06:30:10,400
or Superman when he drives the super car

2805
06:30:10,400 --> 06:30:12,400
I don't even know if Superman has a car

2806
06:30:12,400 --> 06:30:14,840
he might

2807
06:30:14,840 --> 06:30:18,290
that would happen

2808
06:30:18,290 --> 06:30:21,040
probably

2809
06:30:21,040 --> 06:30:23,040
you're talking about like a 1% chance

2810
06:30:23,040 --> 06:30:25,040
or like a 0.5% chance

2811
06:30:25,119 --> 06:30:27,360
to do any of these things

2812
06:30:27,360 --> 06:30:29,360
even driving by this person in front of me

2813
06:30:29,360 --> 06:30:31,360
is like a 0.2% chance

2814
06:30:31,360 --> 06:30:34,180
that you'll actually do that

2815
06:30:34,180 --> 06:30:36,180
I'm surprised Batman's not been hit by more trains

2816
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:40,529
it doesn't matter how good you are

2817
06:30:40,529 --> 06:30:45,009
at driving

2818
06:30:45,009 --> 06:30:48,919
going this 200 feet right here

2819
06:30:48,919 --> 06:30:50,919
not possible like no way

2820
06:30:50,919 --> 06:31:06,080
you will lose

2821
06:31:06,080 --> 06:31:10,049
Superman can fly

2822
06:31:10,049 --> 06:31:12,049
so what doesn't mean he doesn't have a car

2823
06:31:12,049 --> 06:31:14,049
what about Clark Kent

2824
06:31:14,049 --> 06:31:18,209
you think Clark Kent flies around

2825
06:31:18,290 --> 06:31:21,540
three, one, action

2826
06:31:21,540 --> 06:31:24,680
no he's got a car

2827
06:31:24,680 --> 06:31:29,220
he doesn't take the bus

2828
06:31:29,220 --> 06:31:32,229
how much money does Clark Kent have

2829
06:31:32,229 --> 06:31:34,229
he's not like a billionaire but he's probably doing alright

2830
06:31:34,229 --> 06:31:41,840
can't hit the lead vehicle

2831
06:31:41,840 --> 06:31:46,000
Clark Kent as network

2832
06:31:46,000 --> 06:31:48,560
is probably

2833
06:31:48,560 --> 06:31:50,560
what does he work he has like the glasses on

2834
06:31:50,560 --> 06:31:52,560
he has the tie and everything

2835
06:31:52,560 --> 06:32:06,369
somebody look that up

2836
06:32:06,369 --> 06:32:08,369
what does Clark Kent do

2837
06:32:08,369 --> 06:32:10,369
what does Clark Kent do

2838
06:32:10,369 --> 06:32:17,349
maybe he doesn't work on a hotdog stand

2839
06:32:17,430 --> 06:32:23,380
he's a journalist

2840
06:32:23,380 --> 06:32:27,599
journalist journalist okay

2841
06:32:27,599 --> 06:32:29,599
he's a newspaper journalist

2842
06:32:34,150 --> 06:32:37,220
this is where it fucks me up every time

2843
06:32:37,220 --> 06:32:41,959
got it this time

2844
06:32:41,959 --> 06:33:02,689
actor you actor

2845
06:33:02,689 --> 06:33:04,689
you actor you actor

2846
06:33:04,689 --> 06:33:19,990
did I get him

2847
06:33:19,990 --> 06:33:36,919
one action

2848
06:33:36,919 --> 06:33:38,919
five stars

2849
06:33:38,919 --> 06:33:40,919
guaranteed

2850
06:33:40,919 --> 06:33:43,919
I guarantee it

2851
06:33:43,919 --> 06:34:37,599
I still got it

2852
06:34:37,680 --> 06:34:39,680
it was a five star up until that point

2853
06:34:39,680 --> 06:34:44,099
where am I going

2854
06:34:44,099 --> 06:35:04,389
Simpsons hit the run man it's the same place

2855
06:35:04,389 --> 06:35:07,400
alright

2856
06:35:07,400 --> 06:35:11,619
that guy's just fucked

2857
06:35:11,619 --> 06:35:13,619
that was a five star fucking run

2858
06:35:13,619 --> 06:35:15,619
and the stupid

2859
06:35:15,619 --> 06:35:17,619
turn ruined everything

2860
06:35:17,619 --> 06:35:35,029
I guarantee it

2861
06:35:35,029 --> 06:35:53,400
my fucking ass that was bullshit

2862
06:35:53,400 --> 06:35:57,560
I was in there

2863
06:35:57,560 --> 06:35:59,560
you saw it like I'm in there

2864
06:35:59,560 --> 06:36:01,560
I don't even give you that shit

2865
06:36:01,639 --> 06:36:20,119
got it

2866
06:36:20,119 --> 06:36:31,000
boot cap

2867
06:36:31,000 --> 06:36:54,099
that was a big

2868
06:36:54,099 --> 06:37:30,439
final level

2869
06:37:30,439 --> 06:37:37,270
here we go

2870
06:37:37,270 --> 06:37:39,270
okay this is your final scene as

2871
06:37:39,270 --> 06:37:41,270
Night Avenger tears through Big Top's hideout

2872
06:37:41,270 --> 06:37:43,270
a tricky stunt is driving on the

2873
06:37:43,270 --> 06:37:45,270
roller coaster track shoot Big Top's

2874
06:37:45,270 --> 06:37:47,270
henchmen and get on the track

2875
06:37:47,270 --> 06:37:49,270
then drift right around the horseshoe curve

2876
06:37:49,270 --> 06:37:51,270
as you're nearing the end

2877
06:37:51,270 --> 06:37:53,270
take an abrupt left to break through the railing

2878
06:37:53,270 --> 06:37:55,270
then maintain your speed so you'll be set

2879
06:37:55,349 --> 06:37:57,349
I'm the roller coaster

2880
06:37:57,349 --> 06:37:59,349
this is your last chance to impress Mr. Reitman

2881
06:37:59,349 --> 06:38:01,349
give it your all

2882
06:38:01,349 --> 06:38:03,720
okay boys and girls time for the finale

2883
06:38:03,720 --> 06:38:05,720
let's hurry it up so I can start shopping

2884
06:38:05,720 --> 06:38:07,720
for my red carpet tux

2885
06:38:07,720 --> 06:38:13,090
alright

2886
06:38:34,849 --> 06:38:36,849
what do you want me to do

2887
06:38:36,849 --> 06:38:52,069
wow

2888
06:38:52,069 --> 06:38:54,069
that's a lot going on

2889
06:38:54,069 --> 06:38:56,369
you're at it

2890
06:38:56,369 --> 06:39:19,990
go let's go

2891
06:39:20,069 --> 06:39:34,400
oh this is gonna be hard

2892
06:39:40,490 --> 06:40:25,659
gotta go all the way

2893
06:40:25,659 --> 06:40:37,310
NITRO!

2894
06:40:37,310 --> 06:40:41,919
that's gotta be close

2895
06:40:41,919 --> 06:40:43,919
400,000 what was that 5 stars

2896
06:40:43,919 --> 06:41:00,599
that's how you go out strong

2897
06:41:00,599 --> 06:41:13,150
5 star

2898
06:41:13,150 --> 06:41:24,409
I'm gonna get a 5 star replay

2899
06:41:24,409 --> 06:41:26,409
see the guarantee was for this level not the last one

2900
06:41:26,409 --> 06:41:28,409
my guarantee meter was off a little bit

2901
06:41:29,409 --> 06:41:50,279
that could have been cleaner but

2902
06:41:50,279 --> 06:41:52,279
just fly right off

2903
06:41:52,360 --> 06:42:23,439
alright

2904
06:42:23,439 --> 06:42:26,069
so now we get to see the movie right

2905
06:42:26,069 --> 06:42:28,069
let's check out the Batman trailer

2906
06:42:28,069 --> 06:42:43,040
what's possessed you

2907
06:42:43,040 --> 06:42:46,950
fear

2908
06:42:46,950 --> 06:42:48,950
and rage

2909
06:42:48,950 --> 06:42:59,250

it feels really good

3211
07:13:56,409 --> 07:14:14,779
this car has nitro

3212
07:14:14,779 --> 07:14:20,599

3226
07:16:07,500 --> 07:16:15,290
constructor

3227
07:16:15,290 --> 07:16:17,290

07:16:31,500 --> 07:16:33,500
did you miss the main story yeah

3231
07:16:33,500 --> 07:16:41,819
I went through the whole game

3232
07:16:41,819 --> 07:16:43,819
I didn't 5 star every level but I certainly

3233
07:16:43,819 --> 07:16:53,419
completed it

3234
07:16:53,419 --> 07:16:56,040
now this is with the missile

3235
07:16:56,040 --> 07:16:58,040
oh yeah he's gonna give up the

3236
07:16:58,040 --> 07:17:00,040
yep he's gonna say do this do that

3237
07:17:00,040 --> 07:17:02,040
oh that's cheating

3238
07:17:02,040 --> 07:17:06,720
no I'm not gonna cheat

3239
07:17:06,720 --> 07:17:08,889
didn't even get it wait

3240
07:17:08,889 --> 07:17:10,889
I went too fast

3241
07:17:10,889 --> 07:17:31,020
no square

3242
07:17:31,099 --> 07:17:35,840
how am I supposed to land

3243
07:17:35,840 --> 07:17:37,840
on top of this

3244
07:17:37,840 --> 07:17:39,840
I'll have to jump over it

3245
07:17:39,840 --> 07:17:42,590
sideways

3246
07:17:42,590 --> 07:17:44,590
a few times

3247
07:17:44,590 --> 07:17:48,360
that counts right

3248
07:17:48,360 --> 07:17:57,180
alright not bad

3249
07:17:57,180 --> 07:17:59,180
through there

3250
07:17:59,180 --> 07:18:11,259
alright come on

3251
07:18:11,259 --> 07:18:23,279
that one did it

3252
07:18:23,279 --> 07:18:25,279
that one was actually really cool

3253
07:18:25,279 --> 07:18:29,240
do I have to watch the 5 star replay

3254
07:18:29,240 --> 07:18:31,240
I mean you kind of have to every time right

3255
07:18:31,240 --> 07:18:44,560
so LTXT error that's

3256
07:18:44,639 --> 07:18:48,799
what's happening

3257
07:18:48,799 --> 07:18:52,830
does anyone actually know the difference

3258
07:18:52,830 --> 07:18:54,830
between a 5 star replay and a regular

3259
07:18:54,830 --> 07:18:56,830
replay you know what I'm trying to say

3260
07:18:56,830 --> 07:18:58,830
is there a different

3261
07:18:58,830 --> 07:19:00,830
thing did they do it better

3262
07:19:00,830 --> 07:19:08,439
bad ending

3263
07:19:11,200 --> 07:19:15,680
I know I can like getting any

3264
07:19:15,680 --> 07:19:17,680
what's the final one here

3265
07:19:17,680 --> 07:19:22,279
I already see frost

3266
07:19:22,279 --> 07:19:24,279
I don't want to do it I do see boat

3267
07:19:24,279 --> 07:19:33,180
jump though I would love

3268
07:19:33,180 --> 07:19:35,680
another one of these games though this game

3269
07:19:35,759 --> 07:19:37,759
is a lot of fun

3270
07:19:37,759 --> 07:19:39,759
just that one level in the ice place

3271
07:19:39,759 --> 07:19:41,759
was nearly almost a meltdown

3272
07:19:41,759 --> 07:19:44,380
I mean it kind of was that's the one thing

3273
07:19:44,380 --> 07:19:46,750
that I didn't like about the whole game

3274
07:19:46,750 --> 07:19:48,750
and as like a 7 to 8

3275
07:19:48,750 --> 07:19:51,119
hour experience

3276
07:19:51,119 --> 07:19:53,419
I would love another one of these

3277
07:19:53,419 --> 07:19:55,419
with updated graphics and better engine

3278
07:19:55,419 --> 07:19:57,849
it would be so much fun

3279
07:19:57,849 --> 07:19:59,849
I want to place the cameras

3280
07:19:59,849 --> 07:20:03,689
imagine you have control of where you can place the cameras

3281
07:20:03,689 --> 07:20:05,689
during the actual scene

3282
07:20:05,689 --> 07:20:20,479
it would be awesome

3283
07:20:20,560 --> 07:20:22,560
shit did I make it I don't think I did

3284
07:20:22,560 --> 07:20:24,560
just barely

3285
07:20:24,560 --> 07:20:28,840
that was close enough

3286
07:20:28,840 --> 07:20:32,299
that was close enough

3287
07:20:36,889 --> 07:20:56,520
alright that's the first

3288
07:20:56,520 --> 07:20:59,919
one star in a while

3289
07:20:59,919 --> 07:21:01,919
so here's what we're going to do

3290
07:21:01,919 --> 07:21:04,349
because it's already been about 7 and a half hours

3291
07:21:04,349 --> 07:21:06,349
I think I want to go

3292
07:21:06,349 --> 07:21:08,349
relax for a little bit

3293
07:21:08,349 --> 07:21:10,909
play full

3294
07:21:10,909 --> 07:21:12,909
rounds of mario young

3295
07:21:12,909 --> 07:21:15,150
I think that's what I'm thinking of

3296
07:21:24,169 --> 07:21:26,169
I'm kind of feeling it right now

3297
07:21:26,169 --> 07:21:28,919
just relax and just chill

3298
07:21:28,919 --> 07:21:30,919
and that's actually probably how we'll do the bits

3299
07:21:30,919 --> 07:21:33,680
because I wanted to do the bits from

3300
07:21:33,680 --> 07:21:35,680
last night as well because they got cut off

3301
07:21:35,680 --> 07:21:37,680
so I think just playing some yasi

3302
07:21:37,680 --> 07:21:39,680
going over the bits sounds like an

3303
07:21:39,680 --> 07:21:41,680
interesting way to chill out and

3304
07:21:41,680 --> 07:21:46,349
end the stream you know

3305
07:21:46,349 --> 07:21:51,020
because we do have a lot of bits to go over

3306
07:21:51,020 --> 07:21:53,020
but that was stunt made ignition it was a lot of fun

3307
07:21:53,020 --> 07:21:55,020
that was equal parts hilarious

3308
07:21:55,020 --> 07:21:57,020
challenging interesting

3309
07:21:57,020 --> 07:21:59,959
that was

3310
07:22:00,040 --> 07:22:02,040
awesome

3311
07:22:02,040 --> 07:22:06,840
I'm really glad I played it

3312
07:22:06,840 --> 07:22:08,840
there is one more thing to look at

3313
07:22:08,840 --> 07:22:10,840
behind the scenes

3314
07:22:10,840 --> 07:22:12,840
cars world stunt awards movie

3315
07:22:12,840 --> 07:22:15,150
I unlocked this what is it

3316
07:22:28,400 --> 07:22:30,400
did Arnold did all that

3317
07:22:30,400 --> 07:22:33,599
oh is he alright

3318
07:22:33,599 --> 07:22:55,549
I can't handle this anymore

3319
07:22:59,200 --> 07:23:01,200
look at how high up he is

3320
07:23:01,200 --> 07:23:06,119
that's like

3321
07:23:06,200 --> 07:23:08,200
5,000 feet in the air

3322
07:23:08,200 --> 07:23:12,750
it would have taken

3323
07:23:12,750 --> 07:23:14,750
like a minute

3324
07:23:14,750 --> 07:23:18,970
for him to fall

3325
07:23:18,970 --> 07:23:20,970
alright I'm out of here

3326
07:23:20,970 --> 07:23:22,970
let's go play some mario yasi

3327
07:23:22,970 --> 07:23:27,069
my stomach is fucking

3328
07:23:27,069 --> 07:23:29,240
killing me give me a second

3329
07:23:29,240 --> 07:23:33,209
well I switch over

3330
07:23:33,209 --> 07:23:35,520
if you take it off we'll see you later

3331
07:23:35,520 --> 07:23:37,950
you will see me again

3332
07:23:37,950 --> 07:23:41,790
on probably

3333
07:23:41,790 --> 07:23:44,919
probably Thursday

3334
07:23:44,919 --> 07:23:46,919
I have a lot of stuff to do over the next two or three

3335
07:23:47,000 --> 07:23:49,000
days so you'll see me again on Thursday

3336
07:23:49,000 --> 07:23:52,720
I have a

3337
07:23:52,720 --> 07:23:54,720
very very very

3338
07:23:54,720 --> 07:23:57,020
interesting stream on

3339
07:23:57,020 --> 07:24:00,540
probably Saturday we'll go Thursday

3340
07:24:00,540 --> 07:24:03,930
Friday Saturday this week

3341
07:24:03,930 --> 07:24:05,930
Saturday will be the movies the

3342
07:24:05,930 --> 07:24:07,930
you kind of star in the movies stream

3343
07:24:07,930 --> 07:24:09,930
not it's not the same game as it was

3344
07:24:09,930 --> 07:24:12,939
before this is completely

3345
07:24:12,939 --> 07:24:14,939
different I had to buy a 360

3346
07:24:14,939 --> 07:24:17,630
for this this is a full

3347
07:24:17,630 --> 07:24:19,630
on obscure ass game

3348
07:24:19,630 --> 07:24:21,930
I didn't even know this existed

3349
07:24:22,009 --> 07:24:24,830
it's called you're in the movies

3350
07:24:24,830 --> 07:24:28,029
it is a bootleg version

3351
07:24:28,029 --> 07:24:30,029
essentially of you star

3352
07:24:30,029 --> 07:24:32,650
we'll see how that goes

3353
07:24:32,650 --> 07:24:34,650
apparently there's like 60 mini games to play

3354
07:24:34,650 --> 07:24:36,650
and you make a movie while you play the mini games

3355
07:24:36,650 --> 07:24:38,650
I don't know but that's what we're gonna do on Saturday

3356
07:24:38,650 --> 07:24:43,580
I have that

3357
07:24:43,580 --> 07:24:45,580
well we'll see how good it is

3358
07:24:45,580 --> 07:24:49,099
but if you take it off

3359
07:24:49,099 --> 07:24:51,099

3360
07:24:51,099 --> 07:24:53,099
