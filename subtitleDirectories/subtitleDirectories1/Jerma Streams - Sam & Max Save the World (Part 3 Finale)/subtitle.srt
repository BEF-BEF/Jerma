1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:13,460
Hello everybody. Hello. Where is he? It's only been like one minute. Come on, I'm a little slow today.

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:31,399
The gas is empty. My car needs to be filled up. Oh, he's a little short today, a little. Yeah,

3
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:40,140
just a little bit. So, uh, last night I did mention that, you know, depending on how I

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,990
woke up, I had some things to do tomorrow, but if I got up and I was alright then we were

5
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,380
gonna go and so we're gonna go. We're good. Sunday stream, hope you're having a good afternoon.

6
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:00,200
Hope you got some sleep after last night. I did. A little bit of a hangover, but it's okay. We're

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:10,859
gonna play Sam and Max. We're gonna relax. We're gonna finish up season one. Only one episode

8
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:27,670
remains. We'll see how long this takes. You said it little buddy. And then depending on,

9
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,329
maybe season two, maybe start episode one or maybe wait, maybe play some more at how

10
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:41,099
this is gonna be one of those streams where we just chill and do whatever. After last night,

11
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:54,090
I need a, uh, I need a relaxing stream. Alright, so I got everything ready to go.

12
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,510
Oh shit, it is Cinco. Yeah, it's Cinco de Mayo. I drank on the wrong day.

13
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:17,099
Oops. Well, anyways, that's alright. No, I am not drinking again today. No.

14
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:28,620
I need a two to three week cool down period in between every time I drink. Hey, you've seen

15
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:37,210
that before. I have to get to do some audio stuff. May the fifth of vodka be with you.

16
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:46,379
No, don't give me this hair of the dog bullshit. No way. That's like, that's a crock of shit.

17
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:55,909
I'll tell you that much. Ready? Why on earth? What in any scenario would you drinking booze

18
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,060
make you feel better after drinking booze all day or all night? No, it just like,

19
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,639
it just fucks your brain up more and it just locks you down. It just puts you back into

20
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:21,849
being drunk again. No, it's water, potassium, you know, coconut water, pedialyte, just hydrate.

21
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,289
Don't like take a shot of whiskey when you get up in the morning. Don't do that.

22
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:36,120
Alright, so let's go. How loud is it? Not bad. Uh, I had to do some video game

23
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,280
tap. I remember that company, which is why every citizen will find a complimentary

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:52,389
government issued in the mailbox. Get to spray in America. Eat this mother up.

25
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:56,789
That building was really close. An announcement from the president of the United States.

26
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:02,889
I forgot he's president, right? You missed your cue. What? Oh, sorry, little buddy in

27
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,289
chief. I'm still thinking about our last case. Little buddy in chief said it was working for

28
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:13,770
somebody named Roy G. Ben. That's what you guys call me. But for who or who? We're detectives,

29
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,250
Sam, not mind readers. Hey, maybe we should ask you bliss mind readers. That's it.

30
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,730
No, that's not it. By the way, have you seen my copy of a medics,

31
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,329
the handbook for multicolored happiness by hue bliss colors? No, think Max. Think. Well,

32
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:32,730
I know I had it this morning. That's it morning in the ancient tongue of the mud

33
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,050
worshipping kapala who tech tribe of the Serengeti. Our word morning means he who

34
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,089
destroys the hypnotic rainbow man. That's the word he fears the most. So this Roy G.

35
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:47,290
Biv is the one person we've met who's never said the word morning. That means it's,

36
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,250
it's the commission. I never did trust him. No chowder head. It's hue bliss.

37
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,009
No commissioner. I didn't mean look, I need you to put out an APB on hue bliss.

38
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,810
Yeah, Max is still president as of now by the Greek goddess Selena and a chariot with dual

39
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,329
overhead cams and silver Fox mud flaps. We're on our way. Let's go. Max. The commissioner

40
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,410
said that hue bliss is currently staying at his exclusive prismatology retreat,

41
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,810
the blister of tranquility. Oh boy. I bet it's somewhere really cool and exotic,

42
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,569
like a remote island in the South Pacific or Des Moines. Even farther, pal.

43
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:32,420
The game is quiet. It shouldn't be. I'll turn it up. Oh, it's German moon. German moon.

44
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:49,620
Why is his face on the moon? How's the hangover? It's all right. It's not terrible.

45
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:57,699
I woke up looking down. It was like four to five on the 10 point hangover skill.

46
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:10,939
We've diminished down to about three. I'm good. Just a little slow. Bright side of the moon.

47
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,209
You woke up covered in cardboard and wine. Back on the moon, doesn't it? We made good time too.

48
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:23,129
We've still got plenty of generic brand powdered orange flavor drink mix left.

49
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,970
You always did know how not to infringe on a registered trademark, little buddy.

50
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,769
What are we doing first, Sam? Let's locate the blister of tranquility. Find out what hue bliss

51
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:36,329
is up to and arrest his unprincipled magical butt. Is that a visitor center?

52
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:47,379
Is there a center on the moon? Hey, don't scoff at that. Eventually you're gonna be able to go to

53
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,810
the moon for free. That's right. There's gonna be just a train you can take from here to the

54
00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:03,980
moon. Not gonna cost any money. It's gonna be old news in like 100 years. All right,

55
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,019
Harry. Wait, wasn't this the- Well, well. Aren't you Teddy Bear? Once upon a time,

56
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:16,569
but no longer. Wasn't this person way bigger? This dude was like 10 feet tall.

57
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,660
How would a train work? Just lay train tracks down to the moon. It's gonna be like an Elon Musk

58
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,649
bullet train. They'll be floating moon beams or something. Doesn't matter. They're reusing assets.

59
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:40,649
Who are you now? I've gone back to being Harry Mole Man. Or should I say I've gone forward?

60
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:44,730
Prismatology has helped me find a new me where the old one used to be.

61
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,199
Prismatology. So this, that's the whole mind control thing. It's been hue bliss the whole

62
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:59,480
time. You see, yeah, there we go. You seem shorter than you used to. Tiny. I used to

63
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,680
use that exoskeleton, but Prismatology has taught me that size doesn't matter. Color does. Harry

64
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,439
Mole Man will never be sensitive about being diminutive again. Or about referring to himself

65
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,959
in the third person apparently. And also you explode in that whole factory. Prismatology helped

66
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,839
me put Harry Mole Man back together again. Looks like it may have left out a few pieces

67
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:33,850
by mistake. Oh, hold on. Streamlabs windows in the wrong spot. Are you still a criminal?

68
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,370
Are you still a notorious criminal? Or an obscure one like Kevin Mitnick? No. I don't know

69
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,090
who that is. I've postulated my lemma since Prismatology found me. It's the straight and

70
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:52,169
narrow for Harry Mole Man from here on out. All right. Well, I guess it's nice to see you again.

71
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:56,090
Actually, I'm still a little sore that he tried to get you to shoot me last time we

72
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,690
saw him. I'm channeling my saturation towards making amends for my past transgressions.

73
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,570
Prismatology has taught me. Yeah, yeah, we get it. So is Prismatology like a

74
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,220
take on Scientology? Is that kind of what the deal is here? All right. Where's Mr.

75
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,379
Hugh Bliss? Seen Hugh Bliss around here lately? To see the master I need only search my heart.

76
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,659
I meant see him in the traditional fashion. No. Windows. He's usually in the blister these days.

77
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:31,399
Okay, so where's the blister? Which way to the blister of tranquility? Enlightenment

78
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,879
is the only way to reach the blister of tranquility. How about we enlighten your

79
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,200
skull a little? Would that work? The blister is through that little box right over there.

80
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,120
Little box, all right. See you later. We've got important sightseeing to do.

81
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,909
Great! That's what we got, huh? Wait, wait. Okay, so this is the blister of tranquility.

82
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,230
Let's this guy back again. Wait, didn't we fire this guy? No, he went on vacation.

83
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:07,019
Hold on. What's a hypno beam display? Let's just look. What's supposed to go here?

84
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,899
These hypnotic goggles were an early prototype of the hypno beam technology currently being

85
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:17,500
used to further the worldwide goals of Prismatology. Wow! Invisible goggles!

86
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,740
The goggles were stolen a few months ago. Honestly, some people will take anything

87
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:30,169
that's not bolted to the floor. So, all right. What is this thing? Can I pick up a spoon? What's

88
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:36,250
this? Looks like a bent spoon with some peanut butter on it. The power to bend and rebend spoons

89
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,289
stored within this completely indestructible magical talisman was among the first mental

90
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:46,970
abilities to be developed and popularized by Hugh Bliss. Big deal! I can bend spoons with my

91
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:54,889
bare hands. One question, would it work on wrenches? Yeah, a wrench is close enough.

92
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,409
Interesting, interesting. Ah, you made me forget where I was. Let's see. Indestructible

93
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:06,570
magical talismans. Oh, yeah. The virtually indestructible display case is a triumph of

94
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,730
modern Prismatological science. So smash it, textbook. Virtually indestructible?

95
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,370
Extensive testing has been done on the case, showing it to be impervious to bullets, acid,

96
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,570
high falls, crushing force, sonic weaponry, diamond chip drills, hurricanes, poisons,

97
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,210
cynicism, and liquid nitrogen. Don't touch it, you might break it. Oops,

98
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:35,750
it's not held down very securely. No, let it break. Okay, so, yeah, how are they breathing?

99
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:43,240
There's no oxygen on the moon. What's with the chart? I bet it shows how Justin Timberlake

100
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,960
is descended from the moon people. This chart outlines Hugh Bliss's ingenious master

101
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,799
plan to hypnotize everyone on earth through connections with the U.S. government,

102
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,960
the internet, and the toy mafia. Well, that was close. That was a boomer joke.

103
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,639
You're right, I was. I wonder why I didn't know anything about this at the time.

104
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,149
Have you ever been to the moon? Have you ever been to the moon?

105
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:11,029
So you can't tell me what's there. You don't know what's there. You've just been

106
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:22,440
shown things on TV. You know what else is shown on TV? Dragons. And fire. Are dragons real?

107
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,879
All right, I'm doing like a moon isn't real thing and I don't really want to be the guy that

108
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:43,559
says that. The moon banger? What does this thing say?

109
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,759
While I was looking at your beautiful ceiling architecture.

110
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:53,080
What mafia? Don't try that again. I'll have to get ugly. I guess a lot of people have done it

111
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,740
already. Yes, but I always. Okay. All right, so we got to find a way to get by this.

112
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:09,559
So he's going to frisk to somehow get that out of here without him frisking us or without

113
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:20,659
him finding it somehow. Let me look around. There's the lunar lander. This is ours.

114
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:29,370
No, wait, what? It's a lunar lander. So is my aunt Tilly, but they can't prove anything.

115
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:38,039
It's a lunar lander. No, that wasn't an undertale reference, guys. Not everything is an

116
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,940
undertale reference. Lovely shirt. Can I get one Sam? Can I, can I, can I, can I?

117
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,830
You don't wear shirts, Max. I can still accumulate them, can't I? One moment,

118
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,250
please. What the hell? I didn't do anything. Okay, go ahead. So we have to get him to run

119
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,700
away somehow. He's going to be like, there's a slightly beat up robotic exoskeleton. I have

120
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:13,379
to go to the bathroom. They all have to go to the bathroom. We'll just get like the,

121
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,950
give him a soda. He'll just pee. All right. Well, what's going on with you? What's Superball?

122
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,149
Hey, small worlds. It's our favorite cabinet secretary and secret service man, agent Superball.

123
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,389
Favorite? That'd be like choosing a favorite child, Sam. I love them all.

124
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:29,909
It's Tuesday already?

125
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,269
I do like, I do like the tie.

126
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:05,350
What's a level red prismatologist? Level red is apex of prismatology, sir. You'd have to

127
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,629
undergo spectrum analysis to determine your current level. Spectrum analysis. Is that where

128
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,549
you lie perfectly still in a lead coffin while brightly colored cotton swabs are inserted

129
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:21,960
into various orifices? No, sir. We gave it up in 87. It's much simpler now. So let's

130
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,039
try it. What is it? Yep. We're level red. Let us in. I'm sure you're mistaken, but we'll

131
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:31,559
run the spectrum analysis anyway. Take this. A unicorn? What am I supposed to do with this?

132
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:41,690
Rub it, sir. Rub it, Sam. Harder. Hard. I'm sorry, sir. The unicorn says you're yellow.

133
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,730
No one calls us yeller. Draw, partner. Level yellow is frankly rather pathetic, sir.

134
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,090
Only level reds may enter the retreat. Regulations? Hmm. However, you bliss would

135
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,169
like to keep the unicorn as a token of his love. Rub it often to measure your progress

136
00:15:56,169 --> 00:16:08,549
towards true bliss. I got paint. Do I still have to get paint? You do that. Okay. How does

137
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:14,149
the unicorn work? How does that unicorn work, anyway? By magic, sir. Right. Either that or it's

138
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,029
just a glorified mood ring that reacts to body heat. Or that. It's got a heated up ring.

139
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:26,460
You're not a believer, sir. I could never explain it to you. That works, too. Why are

140
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,820
you studying this prismatology, too? Not studying. I've mastered it. You mastered

141
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,539
prismatology by standing in front of a door? I am one with the door. We exist in the indigo

142
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,019
wavelength of reality. I thought this was a kid's game. The door is an illusion.

143
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:49,799
So long, Superball. Get out of here. Do I still have paint? So heat. I need to heat this up

144
00:16:49,799 --> 00:17:05,269
so it gets red. We go back to the town, right? Yeah, so let's see if I can heat

145
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:15,339
this up. What, put it on a grill or something? Go to Bosco's? Earth. It looks cleaner from far away.

146
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,990
That it does. That it does. How does it do that when there's no wind on the moon?

147
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:37,380
All right, let's head back. I got my item that I need. Come on. Go, go, go.

148
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,849
Where are we headed now, Sam? We are going to the Earth. Terra firma. Does it actually show

149
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:53,099
you go there? Drive the car in space? No, I was going to say that would be really funny.

150
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,009
All right. Well, what is the final thing that they're doing? Let's check on Sybil.

151
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:19,369
See, the new is just called Queen. The Canada Leaf? What's with the Canada Leaf? Relax, A.

152
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:29,500
Okay. Hiya, Sybil. Hello, Sam. Hello, Max. But we prefer to be addressed by our official

153
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,900
title. Is Sybil hearing the voices again? The people, the people. You feeling all right,

154
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:43,579
Sybil? You bet we are. We just got the best job ever. We are the Queen of Canada. Queen of

155
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,819
Canada. I always thought Rush was the Queen of Canada. How does that work? Queen of Canada?

156
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,980
How'd you land that gig? Did you find half of an old locket dripping with syrup and

157
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,180
bacon grease hinting at a long forgotten lineage? Nothing that interesting, we're afraid.

158
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,019
We answered a classified ad. Yeah, the Canadians are practical that way.

159
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,339
They've been looking for a figurehead to give the country a little bit more class.

160
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:15,849
They said we were the perfect candidate. Can, L-U-L? That doesn't even work.

161
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:30,890
There's no like L or O or that's not, that doesn't even connect at all well, even remotely.

162
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:42,789
But you're not Canadian. How does this work? Heck no, but we took two quarters of French in

163
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:49,589
college and we spelled, hello, will you? If not knowing how to spell is enough to become royalty,

164
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:55,190
I could become President of the United States. You are President of the United States, Max.

165
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,630
By God, you're right, Sam. How come I'm not bombing anything right now?

166
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:07,180
Plus, we were the only candidate. What are your duties here? What kind of stuff does the

167
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,900
Queen of Canada do anyway? It's mostly promotional. We throw out the first puck in

168
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,740
hockey games, that kind of thing. This afternoon, we got to go pose for money. Sam, how come I

169
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,059
don't get to pose for it? We already talked about this, Max. Your gruesome head frightens

170
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:27,900
shopkeepers and plays havoc with ATMs. Our most important job is to look for ways to

171
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,500
spruce up the country. Well, do you need any help with your monarchy? We could be freelance

172
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,619
Thanks for the offer guys, but we've got things under control for now. You're helping a lot just

173
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:47,900
by not making any of the obvious Canada jokes. I got one. I got one. That's just not what we're

174
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:59,079
about. Maple syrup. Am I right? That's pretty good. How can you possibly spruce up Canada?

175
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,720
It's a paradise year round from the fresh air and great seafood of British Columbia

176
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,200
to the bustling metropolises in Ontario and Quebec. You still have that endorsement with

177
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,359
the tourism board? Every little bit helps make ends meet, Max, with the rate you go

178
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,880
through new shoots. How does he do it? I didn't complain when you were teething, Sam.

179
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:23,269
All right, so. See you later, Your Majesty. Queen of Canada. You may go.

180
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:43,130
Maple. Maple. Now that one makes sense. Nothing special. Nothing special.

181
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,809
Nothing special. These must be Canadian newspapers. I never realized how boring

182
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:57,140
newspapers would be without guns. I know this is not the exit. I'm not going to make that

183
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:08,619
mistake. Can I ever open that? Is it ever not locked? Mapleole. That's fantastic. All right,

184
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:29,450
let's go see Bosco. Mapleole story. All right, Bosco, what do you got? What hundred billion

185
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,569
dollar item are you going to? Hi, Jimmy. Up to no good as usual, I see. Back off, Buzz. Get

186
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:41,930
your own meat. I think we already did. The city made us pay for that one when we bent it.

187
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:50,019
What do you mean we? What do you mean we? What do you mean we? Check the tabloids.

188
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:56,710
President and assistant. Assistant? Needs Vaseline. Gave 10 community subs.

189
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:05,700
Thank you for the 10 subs. Needs Vaseline. A lot of subs. Big sub drop. Thank you.

190
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:15,380
Congratulations to those that got the subs. Okay, do you think I can do 10 claps without

191
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:22,779
counting them? Hey, Bosco. Oh, dear God. Did I tell you boys not to track mud in the store?

192
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:28,859
I just vacuumed. Hey, lady. We're looking for Bosco. You know him? Of course. He's my son.

193
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,180
You're your own mother? Is there no escaping these infernal time travel paradoxes?

194
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:42,890
Hey, guys, it's me, Bosco. We want to buy something. We want to buy something.

195
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,130
Did you finish all your chores? Yes. Why is he pretending to be your mother?

196
00:23:51,529 --> 00:24:01,430
This is not a Russian or a French guy or why is it his mother? Do you have any completed

197
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:09,029
artificial personality disorder symptoms forms? You do? Wow, that really would have come in handy

198
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:15,910
earlier. Do you have any video of a chicken eating cow manure for laughs? These are all

199
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:23,779
things that we have. Do you have any global meatball sandwich positioning systems? These are

200
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:30,490
all things that exist. You gotta be kidding me. Do you have any three foot by two foot cue

201
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:39,259
cards that say don't vote for me? What? I can't believe this. Do you have any instant win cheat

202
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:49,420
codes for reality 2.0? Oh, why didn't we ask before? Do you have Hugh Bliss tied up back

203
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:57,579
there? Too bad. I was on a roll. Too bad. Well, what do you have? What do you got? Oh,

204
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,140
my little angel made the most precious device. It's called an earthquake maker and it's just what

205
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,220
you think. A diarrhea inducing cocktail? Max, why can't you be more like your brother?

206
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:16,539
He's not my brother. Sam, I don't want you hanging around with him. He's a bad influence.

207
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:22,650
That he is, Mama Bosco. That he is. All right, how much is it? Knowing you, Bosco,

208
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,490
I'm sure it's quite reasonable, but how much for this earthquake maker? A hundred trillion

209
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:32,809
dollars. A hundred trillion? You crazy fool. A hundred trillion. Look man, all I know is I

210
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:38,730
keep making up the most ridiculous price I can think of and you keep paying it. So I ask you,

211
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,569
who's the fool? Well, with a sales pitch like that, how can we not buy it? Remember,

212
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:52,440
no earthquake in the house. He's not wrong. A hundred trillion dollars.

213
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,019
Wait, what we can sell things to? You know, Bosco, we've collected some pretty valuable

214
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,420
merchandise on our travels. And we have the sneaking suspicion you've got a little extra

215
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,740
spending money. So how'd you like to buy something from us for a change? Okay,

216
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,220
do you have any copies of the uncensored 1982 Armada Santi lookalike contest on Betamax?

217
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,579
Nope. Oh well, that's the only thing I really need, honey.

218
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,339
Okay, well, what else? Mind telling us how you came to be a woman? Did you use lasers

219
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:29,779
or just do it the old fashioned way? Are you sassing me? Boy, I will whoop y'all behind so

220
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:35,700
hard you won't be able to see straight. But I don't see out of my behind. You will after

221
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:42,730
I get through with you. But why mom? But who in their right mind would dress up as their

222
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,970
own mother? No one. Good point. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Just for that,

223
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,210
I'm not going to tell you why I dressed up as her. Oh, come on, Bosco. We were only-

224
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:00,119
You just cost yourself dessert, mister. All right, well, see you later, Bosco.

225
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,839
See you later, Bosco's mom. Go clean your office. It's a pig style.

226
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:14,470
Mama Bosco. Buy the earthquake man. I am gonna and I need to make 100 trillion dollars.

227
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:22,150
Let me see here. Nacho machine. What can heat this up? Nope.

228
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,819
Cover it in ketchup. That seemed to work before. That's already packed with flavor.

229
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:34,339
Jerma, clean your office. Actually, it's real bad. Since last night, it's a fucking disaster in here.

230
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:40,900
It's I mean, there's just cardboard everywhere. Remember I told you I was gonna vacuum?

231
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,289
No, I didn't do it. Do a cleaning stream. I know one way to get-

232
00:27:51,289 --> 00:28:04,200
Oh, here we go. Zap it. Red. Cleaning stream. Just vacuum the ground.

233
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:09,640
Little horns nice and red. Wow, I can't believe the microwave is a high-level prismatologist.

234
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:18,339
All right, so we need 100 trillion dollars for Mama Bosco. Anything else in here we can do?

235
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:27,420
We want to buy something. Give us one earthquake maker, barkeep. That'll be 100 trillion.

236
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:34,220
If you keep making that face, it's gonna stay that way. But my face is always like this.

237
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:42,380
See what I mean? Never mind. All right, so we can go in. We're not gonna do it yet. I'm gonna

238
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:53,269
check a couple places. The chat is overloading with mean power. Overloading. Wait, what's the

239
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:58,309
gumballs? Well, I'll be. The gumball machine actually contains gumballs. There's actual

240
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:20,700
gumballs in there. Wee! Oh, let me chew one. Let's go in the office. So we have dart board.

241
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:29,559
Sophisticated budget allocation system. Hey guys, I'm a memer. Hey guys, I'm a memer.

242
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,950
You forgot to add that part. Did you remember to feed Leonard today, Max? Sure. Let me rephrase that. What have you been

243
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,390
feeding him? You know, bits of string, leftover screws, random scraps of paper I find lying

244
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,789
around the office. This morning I fed him something that said, deed to the United

245
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:55,420
States of America. It looked tasty. Don't do that again. Why would I ever do that again?

246
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,700
There's no reason for me to do that again. Now all those poor bloggers have

247
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,700
to stand on street corners telling passing strangers what tv shows they like to watch.

248
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,259
Do it again. All right, well, if you're gonna ask me to do it again,

249
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:16,980
you're gonna pressure me into doing it. Maybe I guess I will. Well, what do you know?

250
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,819
The crucial piece of evidence in the Hudson River Merman Strangler case.

251
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,380
I'll have to remember to file that once we're done with this case.

252
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,940
Don't do it. All right, fine. I won't. If people don't want me to do it, then I just won't.

253
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,380
It's like if people ask me to do something, the viewers, you know,

254
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,279
you guys, I listen to your opinions, so I won't do it. Good for home.

255
00:30:38,839 --> 00:31:01,240
Get rid of a dog and a bunny all quick and subtle like the message.

256
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:16,660
Okay. Hello, Mr. Pratt. This one's drawn. All right, well, is this gonna hurt me?

257
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:27,799
Hello. Sybil must have a cold or something.

258
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,000
No kidding. Did she say she thought she was a jar of spaghetti sauce?

259
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,039
This game really has kind of dialed it up a little here.

260
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:48,250
Rig the answering machine to shock them when they play the third message.

261
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,490
And didn't I just do that, though?

262
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,650
This is the third message.

263
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,259
That's the third message. Why didn't I get electrocuted?

264
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,140
Hello, Wanda. Sell. Sell. I didn't know you had a stockbroker.

265
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,619
That's the Sunflower Scout troop I'm sponsoring.

266
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,619
Oh, it was shopping. I get it.

267
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,539
Okay. I thought I was going to get electrocuted.

268
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,160
Anybody home?

269
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:26,839
All right. Well, let's just go back so we can get entrance to the Prisma Zone.

270
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:43,980
I didn't get it either. So, see? With a little sad face.

271
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,599
Where are we headed now, Sam?

272
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:51,880
Back to the moon.

273
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,849
To the moon, Alice.

274
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,059
Okay. So let's go bring the unicorn.

275
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,750
Footprint. What's that?

276
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,990
Somebody left a footprint here in the dust.

277
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:12,950
My foot's bigger.

278
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:14,630
No, it's not.

279
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,990
That looks like my feet with a shoe on.

280
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:22,089
All right. Let's get access here.

281
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,589
Hello, Superball.

282
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:28,089
Let us in.

283
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:28,970
Let us in.

284
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,569
Have you achieved level red yet?

285
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:31,289
Yes.

286
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:32,970
I'm utterly flabbergasted, sir.

287
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,450
I'd suspect a trick, but surely no level red Prismatologist would stoop so low.

288
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,089
We never stoop. We're posture freaks.

289
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,369
Enjoy the retreat, brothers.

290
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,349
All right. Up or down?

291
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:46,230
Who's going to go up or down?

292
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,819
Oh, we don't even get to see.

293
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,519
Sam! Sam! There he is! It's Hugh Bliss!

294
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,920
Hi. I'm Hugh Bliss.

295
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,039
Hi, Hugh Bliss.

296
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,240
Hi, Hugh Bliss.

297
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,119
Hi, Hugh Bliss.

298
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,720
Hi, Hugh Bliss.

299
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,279
Jesus.

300
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,799
I so hope you're enjoying my blister of tranquility.

301
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,199
You're all making such great progress unlocking the secrets of Prismatology,

302
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,320
and I couldn't be more delighted.

303
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,199
Neither could I.

304
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,760
Cool it, Max. You're scaring me more than usual.

305
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,000
I have splendid news.

306
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,639
My top-secret plan to hypnotize the entire world is nearly complete.

307
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:31,269
Soon, everyone on Earth will become one of us. None shall escape.

308
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,269
It'll be fabulous.

309
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,070
You're a good man.

310
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Keep up the great work, everyone.

311
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,679
I'm Tickled Pink! Ha ha! An entire planet of Prismatologists!

312
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,960
It's like a dream!

313
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,159
It's a sour dream where you wake up screaming with a gun in your hand,

314
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,760
your pillow torn to shreds, and the upstairs neighbors calling 9-1-1.

315
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
That's right! The best kind!

316
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,920
P.S. Please don't come into my inner sanctum.

317
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Thank you!

318
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,460
Well, here we go.

319
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,059
We have a very large area here.

320
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:17,500
Giant spork, statue, Lincoln, water cooler.

321
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,239
And this is our water cooler.

322
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,920
So this is where you've been.

323
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,960
We were worried sick.

324
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,440
Oh.

325
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,960
Couldn't you at least have left a note?

326
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,480
Sorry, Sam. He sent us an email.

327
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,360
I meant to tell you.

328
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:35,670
Tell a water cooler joke? I don't have any.

329
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:42,139
Look, Max. It's the giant stone head of your old opponent, Abraham Lincoln.

330
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,460
Welcome, brethren, to the blister of...

331
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,059
Oh, it's you two.

332
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:49,820
Not so tough without your fancy giant robot body, are you?

333
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,300
I can still bite off your fluffy little...

334
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:54,460
I mean...

335
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,659
Let me help you, brother, to overcome the orange of confrontation

336
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:04,219
and bathe in the yellow of peace and brotherhood.

337
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,420
Bathe in the yellow?

338
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,820
Just what kind of camp is this?

339
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,619
Okay, is prismatology helping you?

340
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,699
Is prismatology teaching you anything?

341
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm working to master the miraculous power of gastrocinesis.

342
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,340
You can teleport human dictators?

343
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,539
No, he's talking about farting.

344
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:23,739
But now I'm working on gastrocinesis,

345
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:27,820
the ability to make anyone throw up with my mind.

346
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,829
Max and I are always looking for new ways to make people throw up.

347
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:34,389
Teach us.

348
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,789
As it is now, I can make people vomit with every part of my body except my mind.

349
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:43,670
Well, if you are a true prismatologist,

350
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,789
I suppose I'm obliged to help you.

351
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,150
But there's a problem.

352
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,989
I accidentally swallowed the gastrocinesis talisman.

353
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:54,789
Sam, is that ironic or sarcastic?

354
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:56,230
It's pretty damned inconvenient.

355
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,280
Throw up that talisman.

356
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,920
Can't you make yourself throw up the gastrocinesis talisman?

357
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,159
With gastrocinesis?

358
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,840
I haven't thrown up since 1863, right after I gave the Gettysburg address.

359
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,519
I was kind of nervous that day.

360
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,880
I didn't have anything prepared.

361
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,579
So long, Mr. Lincoln.

362
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,059
So we have to make Lincoln throw up.

363
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,019
And we do that not exactly sure how.

364
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,579
Is the rainbow supposed to be going in or coming out?

365
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,059
I think it depends on which way you're facing.

366
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,460
All right, spork, statue.

367
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,059
I never understand modern art.

368
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,980
I think that's the biggest, meanest-looking spork I ever saw outside of Chicago.

369
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,070
Okay.

370
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,579
This place is kind of freaking me out, though.

371
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,139
This is like the weirdest portion of the game.

372
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,920
You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.

373
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,559
You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.

374
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,679
Fascist oppressors.

375
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,150
All right.

376
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,590
It goes around through his mouth, right?

377
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:16,360
What does it end up?

378
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:20,980
All right, so Max, get in there.

379
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:31,500
Please keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times.

380
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,019
So here we go.

381
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:42,250
Did he take a photo of you?

382
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:49,909
That's a source engine door.

383
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:50,150
Yeah.

384
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,539
So we're gonna have to do something with that.

385
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,340
Whatever that is.

386
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm not sure.

387
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,300
I've never seen ants meditating before.

388
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,719
I think this is a pool of artificially flavored fruit punch.

389
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
No cult should be without one.

390
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,639
All right, the chicken.

391
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,010
I'm beginning to think we already know everyone on the moon.

392
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,530
How are you, Mr. Featherly?

393
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,769
Oh, for heaven's sake.

394
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,409
My name is not Featherly.

395
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:20,010
It's Philo Pennyworth.

396
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,289
It's the guy that eats featherly.

397
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:24,329
It's the name of my former television character.

398
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,929
Have you no ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality?

399
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:30,409
Well, what's so important about that anyway?

400
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,030
Um, why Prismatology?

401
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,110
How did you happen to get into Prismatology?

402
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,550
You don't seem like the type.

403
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,590
It's an excellent networking opportunity for an actor.

404
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,469
Yes, this place appears to be littered with Hollywood luminaries.

405
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,469
Ordinarily, it is.

406
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:49,429
I believe there's a party at Kevin Bacon's home this evening.

407
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,630
So naturally, everyone is there.

408
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,150
Kevin Bacon's a Prismatologist?

409
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,369
Add it to the wiki.

410
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,889
How's the show doing?

411
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,969
How's Midtown Cowboys doing these days?

412
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:00,730
You mean you don't even know?

413
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:05,690
The show was canceled almost immediately after your first and only appearance.

414
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,010
All that flap over the tabloid photos of you two with that alien

415
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,170
brought the censors down on us.

416
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,369
That was no alien.

417
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,889
It was Hugh Bliss.

418
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,769
The show was ruined and my career along with it.

419
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,690
Okay, we've got a president right here.

420
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,650
President now.

421
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,809
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

422
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,230
All right, what's with the hat?

423
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,349
What's with the hat?

424
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:33,190
I'm pursuing new opportunities in the entertainment field.

425
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,110
Can you make what are you pulling rabbits out of it?

426
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,170
Rats.

427
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:38,389
Or at least I'm trying to.

428
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,500
Rat.

429
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,460
What the hell was that?

430
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,980
I gather the rat out of the hat trick isn't going so well.

431
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,900
The principles involved are quite simple.

432
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,619
I could even teach them to adult like you.

433
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,940
Now hold on a minute.

434
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,659
But I'm having trouble getting the rat all the way out.

435
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,860
It appears to be stuck.

436
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,760
How long has the rat been stuck in the hat?

437
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,800
You misunderstand.

438
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
The rat is not actually in the hat.

439
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,559
It's stuck somewhere else.

440
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,400
The hat is acting as a dimensional portal to wherever the rat happens to be.

441
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,920
Wow.

442
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,360
Is it magic or science?

443
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,800
Oh wait, is there really any difference?

444
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,920
He's holding on to the...

445
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,199
Okay, so that...

446
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:27,000
I gotta get him off the meter.

447
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,369
Would you teach me how to pull a rat out of a hat?

448
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:33,369
Prismatology instructs us to shoot.

449
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,409
The rat on the meter.

450
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:38,820
But I've simply got to perform the trick successfully myself first.

451
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,619
I can't have you scooping me.

452
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:42,579
No, I guess not.

453
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:44,420
Okay.

454
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,380
Catch you later feather.

455
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,019
So what are we...

456
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:46,739
Pennyworth.

457
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,780
Things to do, right?

458
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,820
My name is Pennyworth.

459
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,860
Get a task list here.

460
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:52,900
Make President Lincoln throw up.

461
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:56,170
Get the rat off of the meter.

462
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,019
That's two tasks.

463
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,730
How to get rat off meter.

464
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,139
Well, here's Shark.

465
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:10,420
Here are the computers.

466
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:12,500
What are you doing here?

467
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,380
Hey, Max.

468
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,739
Is that our bug?

469
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,619
Hey, Max.

470
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:16,980
Is that our bug?

471
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,500
He's still got it.

472
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,980
Thank you.

473
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,619
You're a prismatologist too?

474
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:22,900
Yes, I am.

475
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm so happy I could view rainbows.

476
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,659
Rainbows!

477
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,980
We'll just keep our distance then.

478
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,940
Are you actually going to puke?

479
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,829
Hi, what is this game?

480
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:34,550
This is Sam and Max.

481
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,309
They have sharks in the blister of train party.

482
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:37,429
Season one is the last episode.

483
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,150
All devoted practitioners are welcome.

484
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,909
Of season one.

485
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,980
There are two more seasons after this.

486
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,340
We're just cleaning up season one.

487
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,000
Look, Max.

488
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,599
It's our obsolete computer pals.

489
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,159
The cops.

490
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,219
They don't sound very happy.

491
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:57,739
It's so much louder than everybody else.

492
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:00,860
You destroyed reality 2.0.

493
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,619
Destroy!

494
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:06,300
Remember to adopt a more positive attitude now.

495
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:12,010
Are you going to do season two and season three?

496
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:14,409
Probably.

497
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:21,420
Okay, these games are really fun to just chill and hang out and play.

498
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,099
So they're very relaxing.

499
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:24,579
They're fun.

500
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,840
It's fun to hang out and just chill with chat and play a game.

501
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
And they do that very, very well.

502
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,159
Do the motivational song.

503
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:44,860
I do.

504
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,980
I really have to click this.

505
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,619
I guess I do.

506
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,530
Let's hear that motivational song.

507
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,650
Might as well listen to it.

508
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,690
Why, Sam?

509
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,489
Why?

510
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:53,369
I didn't tell you for how long.

511
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:57,929
And this has taught us we no longer need self-hyphen reinforcement.

512
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,409
We have look inside ourselves.

513
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,010
And we totally rock.

514
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,760
They don't need to do that anymore.

515
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,800
Sorry, guys.

516
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,119
I tried.

517
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,360
During what I saw in season one, episode five, six.

518
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,860
Is prismatology teaching you anything?

519
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,820
That one's my favorite.

520
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,980
It sounds like he's always cursing.

521
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,579
That is because he is.

522
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:28,940
We're learning the most powerful skill of them all to become the MP.

523
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:31,400
All right.

524
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,920
So what's their shtick?

525
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,460
What are your computers doing?

526
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,739
Puke, magic, and what?

527
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:40,340
Prismatology has restored our sense of purpose.

528
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,659
After you destroyed reality 2.0, we banded together to make a newer, even better game.

529
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:47,699
Coming soon.

530
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:50,099
And we'll rock your world.

531
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,139
You came to a private retreat on the moon to work on something as

532
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,300
insubstantial as a video game?

533
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,219
Not just any game.

534
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:00,900
We are creating the most advanced AI in history.

535
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,500
In a world where two forces battle for domination of a war-torn landscape,

536
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,019
only one will draw the line and reign supreme.

537
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:11,380
Do you get to shoot stuff?

538
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,019
It's not a good game until you get to shoot stuff.

539
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,260
Thank you for your feedback.

540
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,019
We will incorporate shooting into version 2.0.

541
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,760
Can we try it?

542
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,559
Okay, Max and I will try out this video game of yours.

543
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,079
Prepare to suffer extreme humiliation.

544
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,840
The year is 2048.

545
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,360
In a post-apocalyptic galaxy run by giant corporations,

546
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,079
you are a cybernetically-enhanced space marine with no memory of his past.

547
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:39,960
We actually have to play this?

548
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,760
Are you the chosen one, Fontole, by prophecy?

549
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,920
Do you have the strength to survive?

550
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,800
Tick-tack-toe!

551
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,519
Oh, no.

552
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:52,119
Shit.

553
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,480
I have to play Tick-Tack-toe?

554
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,079
I'm so bad at Tick-Tack-toe.

555
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,440
You've played against me before as a whole collective chat.

556
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,139
Fear me!

557
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,179
I'm not very good.

558
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,219
I am invincible!

559
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:05,559
I won.

560
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:07,639
You cannot defeat me!

561
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,320
Actually, I just kind of did.

562
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,039
Yeah, Roar.

563
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,800
Your calculations, your chances of winning were one in ten trillion.

564
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,719
The sun was in my eyes!

565
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:20,119
Thank you for playing Tick-Tack-Doom.

566
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,719
We'll continue to look within ourselves and improve our award-winning AI

567
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,960
to make it even more challenging.

568
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,039
It was too short and not hard enough.

569
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:29,480
I want my money back!

570
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,340
Please check again later.

571
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,699
What's the point of doing that, though?

572
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,199
Hmm.

573
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,260
There has to be a reason to do that.

574
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,619
All right.

575
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,019
Anyways, I've got anything else in here.

576
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:47,860
I've got to get the rat off the parking meter.

577
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:53,400
That's priority number one.

578
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,000
Shades of Albert Hoffman.

579
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,280
Is he the fat one?

580
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,480
I love that show!

581
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,079
Okay.

582
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:05,800
Let's go back down.

583
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,239
See if I can get the rat off.

584
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:16,869
What is this?

585
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,440
Oh, okay.

586
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,960
This is what's inside that door.

587
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,000
That's certainly an important looking door.

588
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,440
I wonder what's behind it.

589
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,639
Something really secret or something really ugly, I'm guessing.

590
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,719
Or a really ugly sanctum, right?

591
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:30,760
One can only hope.

592
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,309
Looks pretty intimidating.

593
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,949
True.

594
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:37,909
But only in an inanimate object kind of way.

595
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,349
So how do I...

596
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,510
I wonder how I get through that door eventually.

597
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:52,969
I probably have to pretend to be Hugh Bliss or something.

598
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,300
Menacing.

599
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,869
How long have I been live?

600
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,550
Why wasn't I warned?

601
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,579
I drunkenly said last night that I wasn't going to stream until Tuesday.

602
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,210
But I woke up and I was all right.

603
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,659
So I'm probably going to stream until Tuesday.

604
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:23,780
Where are we headed now, Sam?

605
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,250
Home.

606
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,929
But I got stuff to do tomorrow.

607
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:29,929
So that was why I said that if I woke up

608
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,210
all messed up and feel like shit this morning,

609
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,889
this afternoon, I probably wouldn't be able to.

610
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,750
But hey, we're here.

611
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:40,019
All right.

612
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,300
Let's get the rat off of the parking meter.

613
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:47,300
How do we do that?

614
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,989
Since Max and I never pay for parking anyway.

615
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:53,349
Those things just get in the way.

616
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:57,940
Just shoot it.

617
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,980
Can I just shoot him off?

618
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,699
Scare him?

619
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:00,260
Better not.

620
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:03,900
So what's his deal?

621
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,110
That meter's been out of order for years.

622
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,630
Just because it ain't white.

623
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,269
That don't mean people don't put money in it.

624
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:12,389
It's like an HMO.

625
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,510
Money.

626
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,949
So give it up, Jimmy.

627
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,550
Give it up, Jimmy.

628
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:24,949
Okay.

629
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:31,059
Money.

630
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:38,679
Hey, Jimmy.

631
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,880
Want to touch my unicorn?

632
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,519
No, just touch it.

633
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:53,539
What did I miss?

634
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:54,179
Anything in here?

635
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,130
I need money.

636
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,570
I need like coins or.

637
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,489
Hey, scratch and sniff lottery tickets.

638
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,360
Can I have one?

639
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,739
Chimps.

640
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:12,099
80% crushed.

641
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,409
How do I make him puke?

642
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,820
How do I make Lincoln puke?

643
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,250
A hundred trillion dollars.

644
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,539
Sybil?

645
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:30,380
Maybe Sybil has something to do.

646
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,260
Sybil just kind of said,

647
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,380
I'm the queen of Canada.

648
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,579
And that was it.

649
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:51,260
All right, Sybil.

650
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,590
Let's talk about this.

651
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:54,789
What do you think?

652
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:55,829
What do you think of this?

653
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:56,550
Hey, Sybil.

654
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,070
Want to rub my unicorn?

655
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,949
We have people who do that sort of thing for us now.

656
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,019
Hi, you, Sybil.

657
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:03,739
And L-U-O.

658
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:05,260
Okay.

659
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,539
If you're queen of Canada.

660
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:08,539
How come you're still down here in the States?

661
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:09,420
Are you kidding?

662
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,099
It's freezing up there.

663
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:12,139
We love our country,

664
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,139
but we've got to draw the line somewhere.

665
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,980
Okay.

666
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,739
Have you come up with any brilliant ideas

667
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:19,019
for improving Canada?

668
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:20,619
Nothing solid yet.

669
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,219
We've thought of a new slogan.

670
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,900
Canada.

671
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,300
It's surprisingly pleasant.

672
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,139
But we need something bigger.

673
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:28,460
Bigger.

674
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,380
Something to really put us on the map.

675
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,340
Something daring.

676
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,610
Brilliant ideas for improving Canada.

677
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,210
Nothing solid yet.

678
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,730
We've thought of a new slogan.

679
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:44,250
Canada.

680
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,889
We need a better Canadian slogan.

681
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,650
But we need something bigger.

682
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:49,690
Okay.

683
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:51,289
See you later.

684
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:53,210
Hmm.

685
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,250
A lot of open books that I can't close right now.

686
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,219
Show the unicorn?

687
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,739
I just, I tried to show the unicorn.

688
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,659
She just said no.

689
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:09,130
So we need a new Canadian slogan.

690
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,849
Abraham Lincoln Puke.

691
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:14,260
Rat off of a parking van.

692
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,019
Maybe like bring Abraham Lincoln like old nachos?

693
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:20,420
Wait, wait, wait.

694
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,059
What about in here?

695
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,550
This place should be open.

696
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:30,820
Is that a cat tray full of kitty litter?

697
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,260
Lefties is empty again.

698
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:32,500
No.

699
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,340
Except for the lingering stench, of course.

700
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,699
Let's go back to Bosco's.

701
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:48,920
Come on, Max.

702
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,570
Hurry up.

703
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,309
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

704
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:01,750
Bring him like old gross nachos

705
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,789
or like a rotten hot dog.

706
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:10,820
I could use a hint.

707
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,179
Help me out with something.

708
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:12,679
Sure.

709
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:14,179
Um.

710
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,090
We can just get hints.

711
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,679
I won at Tic Tac Doom, but it didn't do any good.

712
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,280
Winning isn't everything, Sam.

713
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:26,639
Okay.

714
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:31,710
Never mind.

715
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,320
What about, what do you, you want to see this?

716
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,780
Hey Bosco, want to rub my unicorn?

717
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm not that kind of woman.

718
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Alright, so don't win in Tic Tac Toe.

719
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,559
Let's try it.

720
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,280
Let's try losing.

721
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,250
So my confidence is gone

722
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,849
because I thought I just beat the computer.

723
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:01,769
Turns out you're not supposed to beat the computer.

724
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,559
Where are we headed now, Sam?

725
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:08,760
Let's go lose.

726
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:10,750
To the moon, Alice.

727
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,760
Where's the lava?

728
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,110
Did it last night.

729
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:16,670
It's already done.

730
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:22,920
Should be an eight-hour vaude for you from last night.

731
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,150
Alright, let's go.

732
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:36,250
He ate it.

733
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,300
Eight hours for a four-hour total build.

734
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,219
That was actually a five-hour total build.

735
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,039
But drinking a bottle of wine

736
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,760
and talking about like VR and

737
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:54,280
if I sat there, it's quiet.

738
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,280
I could have probably done it in fucking three hours.

739
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,860
It's the experience.

740
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,860
Lava is my favorite game, okay?

741
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,099
Don't take that from me.

742
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,699
That don't, let me have that one.

743
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:05,980
That's my favorite thing.

744
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:11,469
Okay, let's lose Tic Tac Toe.

745
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:16,619
We'd like to try out that video game of yours again.

746
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,019
The box says one hour.

747
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:21,980
No, it does not.

748
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,980
It actually says 180 minutes.

749
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,539
The headset is 30 to 60 and the blaster is 180.

750
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,139
You do the math.

751
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,880
Alright, can you beat me?

752
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,159
He can't win.

753
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,559
No, I don't want to win.

754
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,130
I have to try to lose.

755
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:15,449
I lose, I lose.

756
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:16,650
That's it.

757
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:21,519
No, it doesn't matter.

758
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:22,079
I still lose.

759
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:23,760
Yeah, I lose.

760
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,369
Oh, darn.

761
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:33,610
You beat me fair and square.

762
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,250
Good game.

763
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,969
I totally beat you guys.

764
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:39,929
Our journey of personal awareness is now complete.

765
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,250
Now what?

766
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:45,610
We have mastered the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created.

767
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,329
You suck so bad, lol.

768
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,449
Let me try, Sam.

769
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:50,969
I know I can take him.

770
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:53,690
As super sophisticated AI entity.

771
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:58,409
Brother, speak so that the primitive machines may understand.

772
00:56:58,409 --> 00:56:59,130
Of course.

773
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,690
During the Mordhau stream, I looked over and definitely saw that at least 10 times.

774
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:06,639
Hey, can we take this?

775
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:12,590
You've won free tickets to self-awareness.

776
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,269
You suck so bad.

777
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:18,030
The effects are limited to those of plumbiest composition.

778
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:19,389
It would have been better.

779
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:23,550
The amazing ability to see through lead may be inappropriate for some viewers.

780
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,030
It would have been better if the computer thing said,

781
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,750
how can you be this bad?

782
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:35,309
See, that went a lot too.

783
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,949
How is it possible to be this bad?

784
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,480
If you said that, it would have been great.

785
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:45,880
All right, so now I have the lead vision talisman.

786
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,789
A classic Twitch chat comment.

787
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,380
All right, let me see.

788
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,539
Hello, Mr. Rail-Splitter-Head.

789
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:04,519
So long, Mr. Link.

790
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:08,300
Nothing happened.

791
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,420
So I've got this eye.

792
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,519
Lead eye.

793
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,130
Is it like a scanner on a door or a scanner thing or something?

794
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:21,050
I have to hold the eye up?

795
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:21,769
What about the head?

796
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:32,829
No, that makes sense, wouldn't it?

797
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,639
You suck so bad.

798
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:41,920
Hmm, watch out.

799
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:44,409
It's going to scan the eye.

800
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,579
Neat.

801
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,059
Can we go in?

802
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:51,699
Hmm.

803
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

804
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,119
What the hell is that?

805
00:58:59,230 --> 00:58:59,730
Neat.

806
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:00,829
Open.

807
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:01,869
There's a bowling ball.

808
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:03,469
Hey, I think that's my bowling ball.

809
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:05,550
That's my bowling ball.

810
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,760
So, what, do I have to drop the bowling ball?

811
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:12,659
Neat.

812
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,800
So, intimidating door.

813
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,440
Bowling ball.

814
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:27,949
Probably the earthquake.

815
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:30,429
Get the earthquake gun and have the earthquake go.

816
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:32,190
I need the earthquake gun.

817
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:37,690
What do I get?

818
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,690
A hundred trillion dollars.

819
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,250
Never mind.

820
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:46,989
I have to make him throw up that talisman.

821
00:59:48,110 --> 01:00:02,440
No, I can't shoot it.

822
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:02,940
Can I?

823
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,570
I don't think I can shoot through the door.

824
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,059
Neat.

825
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,719
Yes, that's definitely Lou, all right.

826
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:26,650
That's definitely Lou.

827
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,750
Neat.

828
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,369
That's definitely Lou, all right.

829
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,670
Lou.

830
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:51,639
Did you do anything?

831
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:52,679
Hello, sir.

832
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:53,480
Don't bug me.

833
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,119
All right, what about the...

834
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,159
Okay, giant spork.

835
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:00,960
Can I grab this?

836
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,760
Can I take this?

837
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,559
Can I have this?

838
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,750
I think that's the biggest, meanest-looking spork I ever saw outside of Chicago.

839
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:13,000
All right, let's get back out here.

840
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:17,389
I need...

841
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:19,230
That was also the spoon that I just steal.

842
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,360
Harry, can I...

843
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,989
See you later.

844
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:33,710
Great!

845
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,989
I don't have anything to stop him.

846
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:35,469
Can I just...

847
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:37,710
Can I put lead in his face?

848
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,349
Nothing happened.

849
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:44,349
It really should work on securing this thing better.

850
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,880
One moment, please.

851
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,320
He keeps trying to walk out.

852
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,960
I have no idea how that keeps winding up in there.

853
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,519
Don't get cute.

854
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:57,559
I can't just walk out?

855
01:01:57,559 --> 01:01:58,760
Too late.

856
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,559
What, you're telling me I just can't just slide like a DVD player into my pants and walk out?

857
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:06,989
Why not?

858
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,360
It really should work on securing this thing better.

859
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:25,949
Hilarious as it would be to mix up the displays.

860
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:27,469
Mix up the displays.

861
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:28,429
Like what?

862
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:29,550
Shut up, long head.

863
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,289
Can I like throw it?

864
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:37,849
What if I just turn and just fucking baseball through it into the space?

865
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,980
I'll need to get the case off at first.

866
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:43,949
Yeah, like throw it.

867
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:45,949
One moment, please.

868
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,349
I have no idea how that keeps winding up in there.

869
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,869
Don't get cute.

870
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:52,909
Too late.

871
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:54,510
Okay, what if I hand it back to him?

872
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,099
Someone tried to steal this.

873
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:02,590
It really should work on securing this thing better.

874
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:10,139
One moment, please.

875
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:12,539
I have no idea.

876
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:13,820
Too late.

877
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,030
Hold on, wait.

878
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,039
It really should work on securing this thing better.

879
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:28,329
Here, Max, hold this.

880
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,429
I meant in your hands.

881
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:30,989
Oh, he can eat it.

882
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:31,309
Whatever.

883
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:34,349
All right, we got it.

884
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,190
One moment, please.

885
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,159
Okay, go ahead.

886
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,550
All right, now spit it up.

887
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:49,500
Could I have that display case you ate?

888
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,900
Can you wait 12 to 72 hours?

889
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,019
72 hours?

890
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:59,369
That's some slow ass metabolism.

891
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:11,309
All right, yeah, now, now, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

892
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,110
How fast do you digest metal?

893
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,210
Hello, Mr. Rail-Splitter-Head.

894
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:29,289
Can't you make yourself throw up the gastrocinesis talisman?

895
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:32,170
I haven't thrown up since 1863.

896
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,969
After I gave the Gettysburg Address.

897
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:36,650
I was kind of nervous that day.

898
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,010
I didn't have anything prepared.

899
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,489
What if I get the Gettysburg Address?

900
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:44,110
You're not still bitter about the election, are you?

901
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,710
Or your public humiliation?

902
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,829
Or the cruise missile that blew your body to tiny wig bits?

903
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:50,349
I can't, am I gonna hold it up in front of him?

904
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,070
No, being president is for chumps.

905
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,989
Only a grade A sociopathic masochist would want that thankless job.

906
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:58,590
Grade A?

907
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,630
I'm flattered.

908
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:03,710
Why the long marble face?

909
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:07,789
Because you two made me lose something more valuable than an election.

910
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:10,670
My one chance at true love.

911
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,590
This is all happening so fast.

912
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,630
I don't know what to say.

913
01:05:14,269 --> 01:05:16,349
Not you, moron.

914
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:22,909
I'm talking about that radiant vision of beauty you had interrupt my family values speech.

915
01:05:22,909 --> 01:05:24,190
You mean Sibyl?

916
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,469
Is that her name?

917
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:26,030
Sibyl.

918
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,150
It's like a chorus of angels.

919
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,190
I'm doing like a rap song.

920
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:33,289
Doing like a lot of raps out.

921
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:36,170
They just, somebody else will say the lines too.

922
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,250
For like one line in the beginning.

923
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:50,460
There'll be a verse and then somebody will just like say two lines with them and then

924
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,340
two lines at the end.

925
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:59,070
Or they'll do it again over the same track.

926
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,929
It's called accenting.

927
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:06,030
Yeah, that's what I'm just doing.

928
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,239
Aren't you married?

929
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:11,039
What about Mary, your mannish but devoted wife?

930
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,920
Why don't you find a nice giant statue of her?

931
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,840
Settle down and start cranking out little bouncing baby war memorials.

932
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,199
There are none left.

933
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,320
Lady Bird Johnson had all graven images of former first ladies destroyed during the great

934
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,159
enlightenment of 1963.

935
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:29,710
Okay.

936
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:35,150
We can give you Sibyl's phone number so you can set up a date.

937
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,030
I haven't dated in over 150 years.

938
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,630
I wouldn't know what to say.

939
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,269
Phone, Max.

940
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:43,050
Are we doing this right now?

941
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:47,550
If you'd like to make a love connection, press or say hell yeah now.

942
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:48,670
Just follow my lead, miss.

943
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,469
Can't answer that.

944
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:52,920
Hello?

945
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,000
Hi, it's Abraham Lincoln.

946
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:01,710
Wait, don't hang up.

947
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:05,519
I got needs, baby.

948
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,119
Lincoln and Sibyl ecstasy.

949
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,559
I'm issuing a romance.

950
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:09,199
But what?

951
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:15,079
Wait, Lincoln plus Sibyl equals ecstasy.

952
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,360
You know chemistry because I'm having an explosive reaction.

953
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:27,239
The formula, Lincoln plus Sibyl equals ecstasy.

954
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,659
Why are we doing this?

955
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:35,199
Okay, we'll do this again.

956
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:36,239
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

957
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,440
Hi, it's Abe again.

958
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,360
Uh, all right.

959
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,829
I guess, how about this one?

960
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:51,320
I am issuing you a Romancipation Proclamation.

961
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,039
Let's set aside our differences and commence on the reconstruction.

962
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:00,110
Fuck.

963
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,690
Canadian, right?

964
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,840
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

965
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,440
We have to do something Canada related.

966
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,719
It's Abe again.

967
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,859
Just relax, baby.

968
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,500
Think positive and Lincoln gonna make it all better.

969
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:31,039
Proper relaxation.

970
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:33,279
Girl, you got the curves like a racetrack.

971
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,039
Lady, you a stone cold fox.

972
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,199
You're almost as hot as your sister.

973
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:47,479
Honest, you're really hot.

974
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:50,680
I can't wait to go on double dates with you and your sister.

975
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,680
Why did he say it like that?

976
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,340
Hello, the rest of this conversation has been blocked by CC regulation.

977
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,369
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

978
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,659
Hi.

979
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:07,689
No, fuck, wrong one.

980
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:08,189
Recon.

981
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,779
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

982
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:14,699
Keep calling back over and over again.

983
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:15,199
Hi.

984
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:18,029
Relax.

985
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:19,689
Just relax.

986
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,149
Okay, you got curves like a racetrack.

987
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:26,350
You a stone cold fox.

988
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,630
None of these have anything to do with Canada.

989
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,979
Woman, you got a body that just won't quit.

990
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,380
That may have worked in the 18, but you know me.

991
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:45,439
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

992
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,920
Yeah, this is getting a little ridiculous.

993
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,039
Hi, it's Abe again.

994
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:49,920
Hi, it's me again.

995
01:09:52,409 --> 01:09:53,850
I've called you nine times.

996
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,130
Just relax, baby.

997
01:09:55,689 --> 01:09:56,649
Think positive.

998
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:01,050
Okay, you got curves like a racetrack.

999
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:06,460
Girl, you got tighter curves than a NASCAR track.

1000
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,520
What?

1001
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,470
Yeah, NASCAR is not Canadian.

1002
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,710
Let's try calling Sibyl again.

1003
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,279
Hello?

1004
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:15,779
Hi.

1005
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:19,920
Just.

1006
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,720
Lady, you a stone cold fox.

1007
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,439
It has to be this one.

1008
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,319
Lady, you a stone cold fox.

1009
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:36,210
All right.

1010
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:37,890
Damn.

1011
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:49,069
What do you want to do?

1012
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,270
Start our own alien love triangle.

1013
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,829
Tattoo my head all over your body.

1014
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:57,310
Play some one-on-one love hockey.

1015
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:57,810
There it is.

1016
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:03,319
I figure we watch a hockey game.

1017
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:04,680
Have a couple of beers.

1018
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,359
Get some poutine.

1019
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:07,960
You know, the usual.

1020
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:16,699
Oh, Abe, I'm over the top.

1021
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:17,199
What?

1022
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:19,260
Did he actually say yes?

1023
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,659
Hello, you just totally scored.

1024
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,670
Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln.

1025
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,470
Oh, my gosh.

1026
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,590
What if she wants to get serious?

1027
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,310
I can't do this.

1028
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:27,949
I'm so nervous.

1029
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,149
I've got butterflies.

1030
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:30,430
I have to ask.

1031
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,229
Where?

1032
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:32,350
Stand back, Max.

1033
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,789
Wherever they are, I have a feeling

1034
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:34,590
they're coming back up.

1035
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,310
He's going to puke.

1036
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:37,149
Oh, I don't feel so good.

1037
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:41,789
What if she and I can't hear you?

1038
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:42,829
Oh, man.

1039
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:44,510
And here I thought our trip to the moon

1040
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,710
was going to be boring.

1041
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,550
Max, be a sport and pick that up for me.

1042
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,029
Not a chance.

1043
01:11:48,029 --> 01:11:49,710
He just puked up somebody puking.

1044
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,829
Can I take this?

1045
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:52,670
I'm not sure why you'd want to use

1046
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,789
the power of prismatology to make people throw up.

1047
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:56,909
But go ahead.

1048
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:59,470
I've got more important things to worry about.

1049
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:00,189
It's interesting.

1050
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,840
Oh, we just had a guy throw up a talisman

1051
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,800
of somebody throwing up so I can show it to Max

1052
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,079
to make him throw up the spoon.

1053
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,399
Interesting.

1054
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:13,899
OK.

1055
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,520
Hey, it's that display case.

1056
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,319
Thanks, little pal.

1057
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,119
Zoomed out for that.

1058
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:25,640
I was saving that.

1059
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,140
For what?

1060
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,960
It's complicated.

1061
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,800
But it has to do with my personal vendetta

1062
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,039
against a certain major coffeehouse chain.

1063
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:35,949
So can I make anyone,

1064
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:37,149
can I make everybody throw up?

1065
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,710
How do I, I need to break this.

1066
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:43,789
Can I break it?

1067
01:12:43,789 --> 01:12:44,510
Throw it in here?

1068
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,670
I'll need to get the case off at first.

1069
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:50,810
All right.

1070
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,649
Well, let's go make the chicken throw up.

1071
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:54,380
Might as well make everybody puke.

1072
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:01,399
We might get something.

1073
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:04,479
I'm not particularly interested in seeing

1074
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:05,760
the contents of his stomach.

1075
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,380
Oh, that's too bad.

1076
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,560
OK, so now I have the display case.

1077
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,880
I need to get the case off.

1078
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,170
I'll need to get the case off at first.

1079
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:21,770
Can I just break it?

1080
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,739
You've thrown up.

1081
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:35,920
I think it only works on things with stomachs.

1082
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,430
Wait, can I, can I make myself puke?

1083
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:44,760
I can't shoot it.

1084
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,180
Well, let's go see if we can make anybody else throw up.

1085
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,430
Like you, for instance.

1086
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,529
I'm not particularly interested

1087
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,529
in seeing the contents of his stomach.

1088
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:09,689
OK, what about you?

1089
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:14,439
I'm not particularly.

1090
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,409
I need to break this case open.

1091
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,310
Can I stomp on it?

1092
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:28,590
Crush it?

1093
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,909
I'll need to get the case off at first.

1094
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,369
It's pretty skinky.

1095
01:14:39,369 --> 01:14:40,810
I think I'll just leave it alone forever.

1096
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:41,609
I need a battery.

1097
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:55,840
Can I, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1098
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,920
I can't break it on the spork,

1099
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,670
but maybe can I break and I make it.

1100
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:09,449
I'll need to get the case off at first.

1101
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:09,850
Damn it.

1102
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:10,170
Really?

1103
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,010
I'll need to get the case.

1104
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,090
I'll need to get the case off it.

1105
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:29,199
And there's the bowling ball too.

1106
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:35,560
Can I just have Abe crush it with his teeth?

1107
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:42,250
I just need to drop it.

1108
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,210
Drop it out the window?

1109
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:47,319
Just drop it out the window over the office

1110
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:47,960
and it'll just break?

1111
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,229
Makes sense.

1112
01:15:53,869 --> 01:16:07,609
That's quite a rocket engine.

1113
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:09,689
Can I turn this on?

1114
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,770
Lunar lander.

1115
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:18,489
Who is this?

1116
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:31,739
Really?

1117
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:34,619
That seems way too over the top to work.

1118
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:40,890
Why would I just drop it?

1119
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:49,319
It's a lunar lander.

1120
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:50,119
It's a cartoon.

1121
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,239
Yeah, I know, but I mean.

1122
01:16:53,789 --> 01:16:55,310
Wait, I can go up here.

1123
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,989
Hey, the keys are locked inside.

1124
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:58,189
So many of us are like that.

1125
01:16:58,189 --> 01:16:58,989
God damn it.

1126
01:16:58,989 --> 01:16:59,310
Really?

1127
01:17:00,109 --> 01:17:02,970
How do I get in there?

1128
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:07,260
Hmm, nothing happened.

1129
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:09,500
Come on, this ain't made out of lead?

1130
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,340
Hmm, nothing happened.

1131
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:22,250
The keys are locked inside.

1132
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:25,050
Damn.

1133
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,529
Okay, I have to get in there somehow.

1134
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:33,199
I can't like bust out the window.

1135
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:39,359
Shit.

1136
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:48,600
Ah, I can't.

1137
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:52,920
When I go up here, it goes up and the keys are locked inside.

1138
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,079
I don't need like a coat hanger.

1139
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:12,109
There's a coat hanger in the office always.

1140
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:14,189
Where are we headed now, Sam?

1141
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,279
I'm going to get a coat hanger.

1142
01:18:18,939 --> 01:18:34,649
Eris is one in the TV always.

1143
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,859
Perfect co-op Jupiter.

1144
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:44,189
There it is.

1145
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,840
Sam, without that, we can't watch Colonel Mudshank's monkey party tonight.

1146
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,159
They were going to vote somebody out of the monkey house.

1147
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:54,439
It's for the good of the planet.

1148
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,279
And besides, you had Colonel Mudshank's exile for treason, remember?

1149
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,449
All right, let's get in there.

1150
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:04,489
Open it up.

1151
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:04,810
Keys.

1152
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,579
You crack me up, little buddy.

1153
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,550
Where are we headed now, Sam?

1154
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,770
To the moon.

1155
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,729
To the moon, Alice.

1156
01:19:25,579 --> 01:19:30,859
You crack me up, little buddy.

1157
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:32,060
You crack me up, little buddy.

1158
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:35,130
Okay.

1159
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,880
Coat hanger.

1160
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,640
Lander door.

1161
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,359
Unlock.

1162
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:45,079
Grab key.

1163
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:45,880
Turn on.

1164
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,600
Get spoon.

1165
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,680
And then I have no idea what to do after that.

1166
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:52,250
But we're going to do it really relaxed.

1167
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:59,500
We're going to hang out and have fun.

1168
01:19:59,500 --> 01:19:59,979
Where do we go?

1169
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:00,859
Are we going to a new place?

1170
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:08,300
Oh, he's dead.

1171
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:11,920
I think the controls don't work how they're supposed to.

1172
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,199
Spoon.

1173
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:17,840
All right, so now I've got the spoon.

1174
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,090
For which...

1175
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:20,729
What can I do?

1176
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:23,609
Looks like that rocket melted the virtually indestructible case.

1177
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:24,890
Bend the spoon and then...

1178
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,890
Did the peanut butter on the spoon survive?

1179
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,689
Sorry, little pal.

1180
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:35,689
So use the spoon on the big spoon and bend it for some reason.

1181
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:51,739
I mean, that's very clearly just a please come over here and use this item on me.

1182
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,319
Giant spoon.

1183
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:56,840
Here we go.

1184
01:20:59,789 --> 01:21:01,069
All right, now that's going to...

1185
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,189
We're going to crash into when we're on the roller coaster.

1186
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,079
So turn on the roller coaster and have the car crash.

1187
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,310
Should we be in it?

1188
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:20,619
Am I going to get a game over?

1189
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:25,529
Should I save the game?

1190
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,149
We're going to die.

1191
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,479
Oh, what?

1192
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:51,229
What?

1193
01:21:51,869 --> 01:22:01,340
What did that do?

1194
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,569
What was the purpose of bending the spoon?

1195
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,800
I think that's the biggest meanest...

1196
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,460
Can I go the other way?

1197
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:18,380
No.

1198
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,659
I wonder if I can maybe turn the...

1199
01:22:19,659 --> 01:22:20,380
Maybe have it...

1200
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:20,699
No.

1201
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:21,659
It's going to keep it bent.

1202
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,170
Okay.

1203
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:33,050
So now I should be able to go up here.

1204
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,949
Was there anything else that was bendable?

1205
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,670
This is definitely bendable.

1206
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:44,510
Neat.

1207
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:53,210
Cool.

1208
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,810
But I hope it didn't hurt the bowling ball.

1209
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:00,460
There he is.

1210
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:00,939
He is.

1211
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,260
Jigs up, you bless.

1212
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,180
We've come a long way for this, my friend.

1213
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,460
So buckle up.

1214
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:10,060
Because the freelance police are taking you downtown.

1215
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,979
Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.

1216
01:23:11,979 --> 01:23:12,939
He is.

1217
01:23:12,939 --> 01:23:14,939
You're just in time for the show.

1218
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:16,699
Please, no flash photography.

1219
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:17,500
Ahem.

1220
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,180
People of Earth...

1221
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,140
He's in the moon.

1222
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,739
Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.

1223
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,699
And now, so are you.

1224
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,640
Oh, shit.

1225
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,680
You opened up the portal to Tristram.

1226
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,939
You better go in there and save Deckard Cain while there's still time.

1227
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:44,140
What have you done?

1228
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:47,260
Oh, just enlisted a few billion followers.

1229
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:52,220
Touch me and you'll have quite a happy, angry mob on your hands.

1230
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:52,779
Not if we...

1231
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,859
Reverse the effects of the Hypnobeam?

1232
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:56,460
I don't think so.

1233
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:01,979
For in all the universe there's only one force chaotic and destructive enough to stop me now.

1234
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:04,460
But you wouldn't do that, would you, Max?

1235
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,180
Who, me?

1236
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:08,380
Well, I'm flattered, but...

1237
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,060
No, you wouldn't.

1238
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,220
Because I'm going to...

1239
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,420
Drumroll, please.

1240
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:19,000
Really?

1241
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,359
What does that even mean?

1242
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:22,840
It means I chop off every part of you I don't like.

1243
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:26,439
It's like circumcision, but double the laps.

1244
01:24:26,439 --> 01:24:26,939
Hey!

1245
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,359
Wait, what?

1246
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:29,640
Here we go.

1247
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,800
Goodbye, murderous hand.

1248
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,880
Goodbye, gluttonous stomach.

1249
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,789
Goodbye, slothful tail.

1250
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:42,739
This is...

1251
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,439
And with those naughty body parts, your vices are purged from your soul.

1252
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:49,939
Bye-bye.

1253
01:24:54,619 --> 01:24:57,420
Jerkbag, I'm gonna use it to shoot you all!

1254
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,119
Oh boy, a stomach!

1255
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,439
Just what I always wanted.

1256
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:06,920
Now come here and let me eat you.

1257
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,840
Great, a tail.

1258
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:17,840
I just want to lie in front of a TV until I die in a pool of my own slobber.

1259
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,960
Is that a movie?

1260
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,680
What's the movie?

1261
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,239
Up? No.

1262
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:22,880
What's it called?

1263
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,399
The movie with the emotions?

1264
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,220
Go away, rotten maxes.

1265
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,100
I don't like you.

1266
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:30,859
Inside out.

1267
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,539
Now nothing can stop me.

1268
01:25:32,539 --> 01:25:33,260
I win!

1269
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,260
Okay, bye now.

1270
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,460
Yes, my children.

1271
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,380
Let me soak in your happiness.

1272
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,500
Oh, yes.

1273
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,100
Mmm, more.

1274
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,779
Oh, yes.

1275
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:45,739
So good.

1276
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,539
Oh, oh my.

1277
01:25:48,539 --> 01:25:49,659
So happy.

1278
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:50,939
Max, are you okay?

1279
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:54,539
Help me grab that ponytail freak show and reverse the effects of the beam.

1280
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:59,100
But Sam, I love that ponytail freak show.

1281
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,180
I want to have his love child.

1282
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:04,760
No!

1283
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,720
Bad end.

1284
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:10,279
I swear to you, I'll get your vices back or kill us both trying.

1285
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:11,399
I love you too.

1286
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,909
Well, okay.

1287
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,460
He still has fun doing that.

1288
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,619
All right, we've got public address microphone.

1289
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,760
The view screen.

1290
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,520
I can see the retreat from here.

1291
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,760
Apparently Mr. Mind reader has to keep tabs on his followers the old-fashioned way.

1292
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,159
What?

1293
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:31,560
Nothing.

1294
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:35,229
Wait, what?

1295
01:26:35,229 --> 01:26:38,029
These crystals must operate something important.

1296
01:26:38,029 --> 01:26:40,109
No, I just think they look pretty.

1297
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:41,869
A bit cliche if you ask me.

1298
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:42,270
What?

1299
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:42,670
Nothing.

1300
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:53,279
People have earned working as hard as I can to break the spell and make you all miserable again.

1301
01:26:57,229 --> 01:26:58,029
Wait, where's my bug?

1302
01:26:58,670 --> 01:26:59,949
Can I get him to save anything?

1303
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:06,409
Lunar lander key spoon.

1304
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:08,250
Wait, it's worth a shot.

1305
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:11,819
Can I turn these off?

1306
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,159
Someone around here has got an incurable case of narcissism.

1307
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:16,800
What?

1308
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,520
Nothing.

1309
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,000
Unfortunately, they appear to be quite indestructible.

1310
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:25,229
Protected by magic.

1311
01:27:29,529 --> 01:27:34,189
All right, so it turns out I can't do anything about that.

1312
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:38,029
I'm going to have to eventually come near and turn this off.

1313
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,079
Anything else that I missed over here?

1314
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:46,810
Statues, the view screen, I think that's it.

1315
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:47,449
Let's just get out.

1316
01:27:56,649 --> 01:27:57,449
Fixed max.

1317
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:04,890
Is everybody here all screwed up?

1318
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:21,710
Get him in the...

1319
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:23,949
Okay, get him inside the roller coaster car.

1320
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:25,470
Come here.

1321
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:25,949
Get in here.

1322
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,920
Look at this now.

1323
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,600
Violence is the bugaboo of a small imagination.

1324
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,359
You'll have to pry this hand from my cold dead fingers!

1325
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:45,159
Eat the fiery lead of my inalienable freedoms!

1326
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:47,600
Not a very good shot.

1327
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:48,880
All right, let's go.

1328
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,680
We're going to go over...

1329
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,640
Goodie! Moving target!

1330
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,880
No, we can't get over there.

1331
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:57,520
Wait, I can't like press the button?

1332
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,399
Goodie! Move...

1333
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:58,899
No.

1334
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:01,880
So we have to make somebody run around.

1335
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,039
Maybe I can tell Max to run around?

1336
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:13,579
Dang it!

1337
01:29:13,579 --> 01:29:15,470
Darn!

1338
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:18,029
He's bulletproof!

1339
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,470
We both suck.

1340
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:21,699
Hold on.

1341
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,119
Can I do it from here?

1342
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:24,989
Yes!

1343
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:35,239
He's gonna get hit in the face by the spoon!

1344
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:37,500
Wait, it's not bent!

1345
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:38,800
What?

1346
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:41,869
I bent it before!

1347
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:43,229
Did you have fun?

1348
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,000
I thought that...

1349
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,399
I bet...

1350
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:51,319
I didn't think I had to re-bend the spoon.

1351
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:57,720
I bent it before I went up to talk to Hugh Bliss.

1352
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:08,810
You suck so bad, Ella.

1353
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,430
Dammit.

1354
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:15,479
I can't see it from here.

1355
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:19,770
And then you unbent it.

1356
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,729
No, I bent it back though.

1357
01:30:20,729 --> 01:30:21,369
No, check the bot.

1358
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:22,090
I bent it back.

1359
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:24,670
I bent it back.

1360
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,430
I've got people that can vouch for that.

1361
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,229
I did bend it back.

1362
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:39,050
Check the bot.

1363
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:39,550
I did.

1364
01:30:40,329 --> 01:30:41,130
I did bend it back.

1365
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,489
Wait, where is he?

1366
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:43,449
Why is he not in there?

1367
01:30:43,449 --> 01:30:44,970
Wait, I gotta wait for him to go...

1368
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:45,930
Just go back in!

1369
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:47,770
I gotta wait till he jumps in.

1370
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:50,729
Do it now!

1371
01:30:50,729 --> 01:30:51,529
Come on, shoot it now!

1372
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,210
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1373
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:57,949
Oh, we get to win.

1374
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:05,340
Here we go.

1375
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,300
Closed line incoming.

1376
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,300
Three, two, one.

1377
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,420
Oh, it's the hand.

1378
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,140
That's what we needed.

1379
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:16,829
Does he die?

1380
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:41,500
Okay, so we've got...

1381
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:43,659
Let's go out here.

1382
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,260
See what's going on outside.

1383
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:45,579
That's...

1384
01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:47,979
We have one of the three pieces we need of Max.

1385
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,819
Before collapsing under the weight of his own laziness.

1386
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:03,180
Anhui is one of the five fundamental forces.

1387
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,380
He made it 20 feet.

1388
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:05,979
No TV.

1389
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:07,979
Why even go on?

1390
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:11,659
You should all just lie on your faces and wait for death.

1391
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,579
It's true.

1392
01:32:13,579 --> 01:32:14,939
I got nothing.

1393
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:16,140
I'm a failure.

1394
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,100
I thought people were supposed to be happy out here.

1395
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,539
I don't want the verge of tears.

1396
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:22,140
This guy's the death of the party.

1397
01:32:23,659 --> 01:32:26,300
What if it happened to people having a good time?

1398
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:31,100
Hey, pseudo Max.

1399
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:31,819
How's it going?

1400
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:35,180
I need your tail for my little buddy here.

1401
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,300
How about handing it over?

1402
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:43,689
He's heavier than he looks.

1403
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:45,050
Aren't we all?

1404
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,850
Aren't we on the moon?

1405
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:52,029
Wouldn't being on the moon make him lighter?

1406
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:57,390
I'm not particularly interested in seeing the...

1407
01:32:58,029 --> 01:33:02,810
I don't think it works on people.

1408
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,569
Except maybe if they're shaped like spoons.

1409
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:08,720
Okay.

1410
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,439
You have anything to say?

1411
01:33:10,989 --> 01:33:12,270
Howdy, Superball.

1412
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,710
I can't talk now, sir.

1413
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,310
The blue guy is really getting me down.

1414
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:19,149
His supernatural lethargy is crushing my normally unbridled enthusiasm.

1415
01:33:19,149 --> 01:33:22,590
But Superball, you seem as chipper as ever.

1416
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:23,229
Thank you, sir.

1417
01:33:23,229 --> 01:33:26,109
I work hard to put on a happy face, but I'm crying on the inside.

1418
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:29,869
What about you?

1419
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,470
Hi, Harry.

1420
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,550
The blue rabbit's right.

1421
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:38,989
I can't keep a job if my feet stink.

1422
01:33:39,869 --> 01:33:41,470
Why do I even go on?

1423
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:46,170
Come now, Harry.

1424
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:47,770
Give us a little smile.

1425
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:50,010
Leave me alone.

1426
01:33:52,569 --> 01:34:01,399
I don't like this part turned it off.

1427
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:04,060
Well, I can't turn it off.

1428
01:34:04,699 --> 01:34:08,060
All right.

1429
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:08,460
Let's go.

1430
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:09,340
Wait.

1431
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,590
Can I put the bunny underneath here?

1432
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:17,710
Can I slide him over here?

1433
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:33,159
Eris.

1434
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:35,079
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1435
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:35,960
I'm just saying.

1436
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,239
Like he's lying on the ground.

1437
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:39,560
Maybe that'll make him get up.

1438
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:41,640
I'll tell you what I mean.

1439
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,399
Well, I'll show you something here.

1440
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:50,430
We finally get to bend it.

1441
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:50,670
Yes.

1442
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:52,350
All right.

1443
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:55,869
Now we can pull them out of the hat.

1444
01:34:55,869 --> 01:34:57,550
And I never pay for parking anyway.

1445
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:03,390
That thing's been bent for a whole season.

1446
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:04,829
I'm so glad to finally fix it.

1447
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:12,939
Okay.

1448
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:20,060
Holy heaping helpings of high fructose corn syrup.

1449
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,579
He's eating everything inside.

1450
01:35:21,579 --> 01:35:22,060
Everything.

1451
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,300
Bosco, do not freak out.

1452
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:24,939
Attaboy.

1453
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,380
Eat up so you'll grow big and strong.

1454
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,140
What is the world coming to?

1455
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,060
Bosco, pasta knobs.

1456
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:32,859
I'll four.

1457
01:35:33,739 --> 01:35:36,539
Oh, my, that one does have an appetite.

1458
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:39,979
At the rate he's going, his stomach won't even fit back inside you.

1459
01:35:39,979 --> 01:35:43,819
I've no need for my earthly stomach any longer, sir.

1460
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:49,739
I'm on Pupus's handsomest of lemon, water, and sunshine.

1461
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:52,699
As God is my witness, by the end of this day,

1462
01:35:52,779 --> 01:35:55,659
you will be eating cocoa nougat butterballs again.

1463
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,359
Nougat really is so good.

1464
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,720
It's so great.

1465
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:01,680
All right.

1466
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,199
So, uh, get him to...

1467
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,039
We've got...

1468
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,239
What does he say?

1469
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,039
Excuse me, Mr. Vice Manifestation.

1470
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:13,930
You look delicious.

1471
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:15,289
Look, pal.

1472
01:36:15,289 --> 01:36:18,090
I need your stomach so I can put my buddy back together.

1473
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,409
Hand it over and only one of us gets hurt.

1474
01:36:20,409 --> 01:36:23,930
I can't resist the rich, meaty taste of dog and rabbit.

1475
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,449
Well, here we are in your stomach.

1476
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:27,930
What?

1477
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:29,850
What the hell did I just step in?

1478
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:34,409
I'm enjoying the womb-like meditative quality of the pyloric sphincter.

1479
01:36:34,409 --> 01:36:35,289
Darn it.

1480
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,210
Well, I've still got my magic, too, Hickey.

1481
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:45,229
Something tells me I'm going to be smelling that for the rest of my life.

1482
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:48,989
Well, that was, uh, disgusting.

1483
01:36:48,989 --> 01:36:49,630
We do it again.

1484
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,029
It's beautiful.

1485
01:36:58,939 --> 01:36:59,899
Turn this off.

1486
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:05,930
Um, okay.

1487
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:08,079
So, hmm.

1488
01:37:10,829 --> 01:37:13,609
I wonder, can I do anything else?

1489
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:15,850
Sludgey's.

1490
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,130
This week's flavors?

1491
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:18,970
Casper oil and Brussels sprouts.

1492
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,289
Oh.

1493
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:24,600
So we're...

1494
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,039
Okay, we have to cover ourselves in something.

1495
01:37:29,289 --> 01:37:29,770
Has to be.

1496
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,720
We have to cover ourselves in something he doesn't like.

1497
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,479
Roast coffee?

1498
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:36,119
I don't know what we're doing.

1499
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:44,039
Somehow we have to make him eat us again, but this time with the coating he doesn't like.

1500
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:46,840
I'm impressed by the gentle oscillation of the hot weenies.

1501
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:48,989
Yep.

1502
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:49,949
Still a garbage can.

1503
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,630
I can't take the weenies.

1504
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:57,840
Can I bend his stomach around?

1505
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,079
No.

1506
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:00,409
Well, I do...

1507
01:38:00,409 --> 01:38:03,529
I can go do the rabbit in the hat thing.

1508
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:11,449
Because the rat is off.

1509
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:13,479
I mean, the chicken...

1510
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:15,960
The arc of the chicken can finally be concluded.

1511
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:20,600
What about Sybil?

1512
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:24,670
We're here.

1513
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:25,390
Might as well just see.

1514
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:38,300
Okay.

1515
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:40,750
What's new?

1516
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:41,869
Are you okay?

1517
01:38:41,869 --> 01:38:45,550
Hugh Bliss shot some kind of weird energy beam all over the planet.

1518
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,550
Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.

1519
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,670
Oh, no.

1520
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:51,149
And I'm perfectly happy, Sam.

1521
01:38:51,149 --> 01:38:53,869
Oh, and hello, brother Max.

1522
01:38:53,869 --> 01:38:57,550
Tangerine dreams and aqua wishes to you this day.

1523
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:59,069
Why, thank you, Sybil.

1524
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:01,789
You're looking especially lovely today.

1525
01:39:01,789 --> 01:39:02,750
This is horrific.

1526
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,659
How will you improve Canada?

1527
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:10,859
Let's really get to the hard-hitting issues here.

1528
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,199
You've got to snap out of it.

1529
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,359
Snap out of what, friend Sam?

1530
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,359
For the first time in my life, I've got a perfect job,

1531
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:25,840
a rock-solid relationship,

1532
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,560
and an incomparable feeling of peace.

1533
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:32,239
I've never been so content in all my life.

1534
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,359
Don't worry, we'll fix that.

1535
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:36,880
Prismatology is a sham.

1536
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,520
This prismatology business is all a lie.

1537
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,439
Is pure happiness a lie?

1538
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,640
Is peace on Earth a hopeless dream?

1539
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,000
Are unicorns imaginary?

1540
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,079
Mostly, probably, and it depends on-

1541
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,760
Whoa, what the fuck?

1542
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,920
From a facility that processes nuclear waste.

1543
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,640
All right, how's the date going with Lincoln?

1544
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,079
How's things going with you and Mr. Lincoln?

1545
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:02,439
Simply wonderful.

1546
01:40:03,159 --> 01:40:04,840
Isn't that right, Abraham?

1547
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,239
Pretty lady.

1548
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,920
He has such a way with words.

1549
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,600
Why is he like this now?

1550
01:40:19,609 --> 01:40:20,489
Why is he doing this?

1551
01:40:20,489 --> 01:40:21,289
Why is he like this?

1552
01:40:25,069 --> 01:40:26,510
It sounds like Mr.

1553
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:28,590
Look at me, I wrote the Gettysburg address.

1554
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:30,670
Isn't as good with words as he led us to believe.

1555
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:34,989
Oh, he'll be fine once he's managed to stop hyperventilating.

1556
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,899
Are you two planning on having kids someday?

1557
01:40:48,989 --> 01:40:49,869
So long, Sybil.

1558
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,119
What's up, A.L.?

1559
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,479
How's the date going?

1560
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,399
Oh, thank goodness you two have come.

1561
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:57,039
Now we can talk.

1562
01:40:57,039 --> 01:40:58,960
Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.

1563
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,760
You're looking quite distinguished today.

1564
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,119
What's wrong with him?

1565
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,960
He hasn't been himself lately.

1566
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:05,760
Whatever.

1567
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,359
You've got to help me with this date.

1568
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,560
The honeymoon's already over?

1569
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,359
What's the problem?

1570
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,279
She's really into me.

1571
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,640
See there, Abraham?

1572
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,439
That's the problem.

1573
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,600
Oh, the Turk was a little bit of courage.

1574
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:23,039
No, I mean really into me.

1575
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:24,880
She's so nice.

1576
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,880
It's giving me the creeps.

1577
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:30,279
I thought you'd be used to blissed out people

1578
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:32,840
after spending so much time at the moon retreat.

1579
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,640
Sure, when you're around a bunch of other single guys,

1580
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,000
that's one thing.

1581
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,760
But this, what do I do if she wants to get intimate?

1582
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,880
I'm not cut out for this.

1583
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:43,800
There, there, Abraham.

1584
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:47,079
That's just the yellow of your cowardice speaking.

1585
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,039
Seriously, how long is he going to be like this?

1586
01:41:50,039 --> 01:41:50,920
I'm working on it.

1587
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:55,289
How did you avoid getting hit by Hugh Bliss's

1588
01:41:55,289 --> 01:41:56,729
mind-altering happiness ray?

1589
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:59,770
I miss the great blissification?

1590
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:02,090
Dammit, I knew I shouldn't have stopped

1591
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,930
by the gift shop on the way down here.

1592
01:42:05,289 --> 01:42:05,770
Anything else?

1593
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,210
Do you know how to stop Hugh Bliss's

1594
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,729
world domination scheme?

1595
01:42:08,729 --> 01:42:10,250
Why would I want to stop it?

1596
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,130
Under Hugh Bliss, all men are created equal.

1597
01:42:13,689 --> 01:42:14,649
That's kind of my thing.

1598
01:42:15,289 --> 01:42:18,359
You and Sybil should think about starting a family.

1599
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:20,600
This is all happening too fast.

1600
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,680
It's been over a hundred years.

1601
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,600
My stomach's doing backflips.

1602
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,359
I don't know what women like.

1603
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:28,920
Women like to be treated as equal partners

1604
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:32,920
in love and trust, a foundation of honesty.

1605
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,479
Seriously, make him stop talking.

1606
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:37,319
I'm nauseated enough as it is.

1607
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,199
Anything else?

1608
01:42:40,199 --> 01:42:41,720
You're ever the romantic, Mr. Lincoln.

1609
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,119
Lucky at uniting a nation on the brink of war.

1610
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:45,800
Unlucky in love.

1611
01:42:46,989 --> 01:42:47,949
You're ever the romantic.

1612
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:52,350
Anything else from Sybil before I go do the hat?

1613
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,310
Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.

1614
01:42:55,399 --> 01:42:57,880
Have you had any new ideas for improving Canada?

1615
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,920
With this new feeling of peace and tranquility,

1616
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:04,600
I feel like my mind is alive with possibilities.

1617
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,279
See, it wasn't, A, Lincoln wasn't married.

1618
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:09,960
I only wish there was some way to extend this feeling

1619
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,680
of goodwill and generosity to all countries of the world.

1620
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:18,840
I always suspected that when the world turned nice and pleasant,

1621
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,600
Canada would be the first to fall.

1622
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:23,920
So long, Sybil.

1623
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:33,390
Ah, Sam.

1624
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:33,710
Hey.

1625
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:42,560
All right, let's go to the bird.

1626
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:44,399
Chicken with the hat.

1627
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:48,000
To the moon, Alice.

1628
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,399
Can now do the trick, which I don't know what that gets us to.

1629
01:43:51,039 --> 01:44:00,170
I'm at that point in my, was drinking coffee.

1630
01:44:01,289 --> 01:44:02,250
Or it's just the ice.

1631
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:08,079
And the ice is slowly melted into that gross freezer taste.

1632
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:10,720
You know what I'm saying?

1633
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:14,699
When the ice cubes melt and it's only that gross freezer water.

1634
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,939
I hate that.

1635
01:44:16,939 --> 01:44:28,909
I gotta go refill it.

1636
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,449
Just don't drink iced coffee.

1637
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:32,569
I can't help it.

1638
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:33,529
I can't help it.

1639
01:44:33,529 --> 01:44:34,329
I'm American.

1640
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:40,760
I read this somewhere that it's only Americans put ice in everything.

1641
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:42,119
Is that true?

1642
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:43,640
Or did I get like Reddit lied to?

1643
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:51,369
Okay, so now you should be able to do it.

1644
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:55,039
How's it going?

1645
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:55,680
Silence.

1646
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:59,680
I believe I have finally mastered this pinnacle of

1647
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,399
Hot coffee is better.

1648
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:02,720
I bet you don't even use the metric system.

1649
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,159
Rat from the hat.

1650
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,680
I don't use the metric system and I drink hot coffee all the time.

1651
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:09,439
I just like ice coffee.

1652
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:14,399
I just remember I can't stand rats.

1653
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:15,760
They're vile vermin.

1654
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,680
Smile when you say that, Beaky.

1655
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:19,279
Beaky?

1656
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,079
Sheesh.

1657
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:22,479
I hate this pulling out of the hat business.

1658
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:24,239
Next time I'll find something better to hang it on.

1659
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:25,199
What was the purpose of this?

1660
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,039
Oh dear.

1661
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:27,920
Did we get the hat?

1662
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,760
There won't be a next time.

1663
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,399
I shall never do this trick again.

1664
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:34,720
Only Americans expect genuine info from Reddit.

1665
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,439
If you would be so good to remove the hat from my presence.

1666
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:38,479
Sure.

1667
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,279
Okay, so now I have a hat.

1668
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,649
So I have the magician's hat.

1669
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:47,840
Hmm.

1670
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:56,939
What am I pulling out of here?

1671
01:45:56,939 --> 01:45:57,260
Hey!

1672
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,000
Okay, this is the...

1673
01:45:59,000 --> 01:45:59,800
I got the rat.

1674
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,279
Now what if...

1675
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:02,920
I can put him somewhere?

1676
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,489
Yeah, I have a rat spawner.

1677
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,640
Reddit, the front page of America.

1678
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:18,890
Well, it was like an Ask Reddit thing.

1679
01:46:19,609 --> 01:46:21,609
It wasn't an article written by a scholar.

1680
01:46:21,609 --> 01:46:26,890
It was just, hey, Reddit, do you put ice in your...

1681
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:29,369
Hey, Americans of Reddit, why do you put ice in everything?

1682
01:46:29,369 --> 01:46:31,050
And then it was people doing the long things.

1683
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:32,489
Well, one time when I was in Germany,

1684
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:35,949
I asked for ice and they looked at me strangely.

1685
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,470
It was like a bunch of those.

1686
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:43,880
That's...

1687
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,399
I'm telling you, that's how it works.

1688
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:45,880
All right, what do I...

1689
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,920
Okay, what do I do with the hat?

1690
01:46:49,149 --> 01:46:49,710
Hmm.

1691
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:55,550
I have the moon key thing.

1692
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:57,390
Maybe...

1693
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:58,909
Okay, I gotta pull a rat out.

1694
01:46:58,909 --> 01:47:00,109
Does anyone not like rats?

1695
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:02,270
Can I make the rats like run somewhere?

1696
01:47:02,909 --> 01:47:08,409
I got a lot of items.

1697
01:47:08,409 --> 01:47:11,000
This makes people puke.

1698
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,920
I have the key to the moon thing.

1699
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,279
I can bend spoons with spoon-shaped devices.

1700
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:17,880
And now I can pull rats out of hat.

1701
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:29,710
Let me go back up in that room up here.

1702
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:48,279
Well, okay, so I have these five statues.

1703
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,220
Indestructible hues.

1704
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,020
Uh-oh, chat's being weird again.

1705
01:47:57,899 --> 01:48:00,460
Prismatology is not the answer.

1706
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:06,800
Unless, I suppose, the question is what's a really bad thing to...

1707
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:12,800
Mrs. Betty Parkinson of 328 Cherry Lane,

1708
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,340
ex-contestant, up to the moon.

1709
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,000
Attention.

1710
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,279
The owner of a celestial-class star cruiser license,

1711
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:23,199
USS 1701C.

1712
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,000
Please report to the front desk.

1713
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,279
Your warp nacelles are on.

1714
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:31,470
I want Sam to read me audiobooks.

1715
01:48:32,989 --> 01:48:39,800
And now, a medley of your lunar sent you la...

1716
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:43,600
Oh, it's a callback.

1717
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:53,960
Okay.

1718
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,720
View screen.

1719
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,000
I can see the whole thing from here.

1720
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:01,869
I don't think I can do anything here.

1721
01:49:02,989 --> 01:49:04,029
Throw a rat at him?

1722
01:49:04,029 --> 01:49:04,270
No.

1723
01:49:05,149 --> 01:49:07,149
Maybe I can put a rat on the blue guy?

1724
01:49:07,149 --> 01:49:08,109
Have him eat the rat?

1725
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,659
Just kill Hugh Bliss.

1726
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:18,520
That's not how it works.

1727
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:34,489
Okay.

1728
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:35,529
Rat.

1729
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,170
Will you move because of a rat?

1730
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:43,600
Hey!

1731
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,119
Nah.

1732
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:46,479
Okay.

1733
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:49,199
What about the unicorn?

1734
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,920
I'm just gonna exhaust all options.

1735
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,920
Do you like unicorns?

1736
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:55,560
Not happening.

1737
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,119
Do you like...

1738
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:01,079
No, none of that stuff.

1739
01:50:03,449 --> 01:50:09,899
Well, we're gonna try to feed the rat to the green.

1740
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:11,979
Hungry Max.

1741
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:20,430
Urus.

1742
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:22,029
Ah, the brute force strategy.

1743
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:26,350
Brute force strategy is a lot of these point and click games sometimes.

1744
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,159
And this isn't total brute force strategy.

1745
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,399
I didn't do what I was doing up until this point.

1746
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:39,630
This is nothing.

1747
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:42,510
I remember the days of playing like original Monkey Island.

1748
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,699
Or Toonstruck.

1749
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,840
And those were so obscure.

1750
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,399
Some of those things you had to combine like three items and shit.

1751
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:54,000
Those games were ridiculous.

1752
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:03,289
Okay.

1753
01:51:03,289 --> 01:51:03,609
Eat.

1754
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:06,670
I kind of have to move out of the way.

1755
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:16,000
Some of those games...

1756
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,560
There's no way.

1757
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:20,800
Maybe a guess if you could.

1758
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,760
But that's kind of a game where you have to have a wiki.

1759
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,159
Something smells good.

1760
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:27,600
Hey, are you gonna eat that?

1761
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,960
Well, I suppose I could share.

1762
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:33,260
Toonstruck is like impossible without the wiki.

1763
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:35,500
Now what?

1764
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,560
Now make him throw up.

1765
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:44,840
Did you get it?

1766
01:51:45,079 --> 01:51:46,359
Ah, done.

1767
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:47,880
Next time I'm hanging on tight.

1768
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,569
So hang on.

1769
01:51:53,869 --> 01:51:54,510
Do it again.

1770
01:51:56,619 --> 01:51:57,119
Hey!

1771
01:51:58,680 --> 01:51:59,399
Here, Max.

1772
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:00,039
Come and get it.

1773
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:01,869
So what happens if I...

1774
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:02,189
Hold on.

1775
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:03,069
Can I pull him out?

1776
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:07,930
Is this gonna be Jerma Rumble live action?

1777
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,970
Ladies and gentlemen, the great Saminian.

1778
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,340
Hey, let go!

1779
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:16,140
Is that my stomach?

1780
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:16,859
Give me that hat.

1781
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:25,069
Well.

1782
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:28,029
Hey!

1783
01:52:28,029 --> 01:52:28,510
See you later.

1784
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,350
I feel all warm inside.

1785
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:35,390
Like my belly's a sort of cozy place where flavored popcorn and sugar drinks can meet and mingle.

1786
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:36,109
That's my boy.

1787
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:37,869
All right.

1788
01:52:37,869 --> 01:52:41,069
So we only have the blue Max left to take care of.

1789
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:54,000
What would move that blue dude winning the lottery?

1790
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,520
Scratch and sniff lottery tickets.

1791
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:57,770
Hey, Bosco's mom.

1792
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:01,180
What?

1793
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:02,939
I thought you were Bosco's mom.

1794
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:03,979
Oh, yes.

1795
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:05,340
I'm Bosco's mom.

1796
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,060
Hugh Bliss.

1797
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:07,340
I need a bunch of money.

1798
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:08,539
Identity really is a difficult concept.

1799
01:53:08,539 --> 01:53:09,659
How do you get money in this one?

1800
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:11,579
We want to buy something.

1801
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:12,720
Goodie.

1802
01:53:14,539 --> 01:53:15,340
Will you just give it to me?

1803
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:16,939
One earthquake maker, barkeep.

1804
01:53:16,939 --> 01:53:18,619
A hundred trillion, please.

1805
01:53:18,619 --> 01:53:19,819
I don't have a hundred trillion dollars.

1806
01:53:19,819 --> 01:53:21,899
Aren't you feeling generous?

1807
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:22,699
Yes.

1808
01:53:22,699 --> 01:53:25,340
But I need the money for my poor sick mother.

1809
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:26,640
Hmm.

1810
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:29,970
Uh.

1811
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:33,840
Hmm.

1812
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:36,670
One earthquake ma-

1813
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:37,949
A hundred trillion-

1814
01:53:37,949 --> 01:53:39,310
What do you mean by a hundred trillion?

1815
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:40,750
Do you mean you're being generous?

1816
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:42,270
But I need the money for my poor sick mother.

1817
01:53:43,069 --> 01:53:43,569
Hmm.

1818
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,100
Hmm.

1819
01:53:48,439 --> 01:53:48,939
Nevermind.

1820
01:53:50,489 --> 01:53:51,210
See you later.

1821
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:51,710
Bye!

1822
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:52,210
Hold on.

1823
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:06,380
Do you have any parking meter that's fine?

1824
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,439
Anything else?

1825
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:13,770
I need the-

1826
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:15,130
I think I need a Canada slogan.

1827
01:54:24,859 --> 01:54:25,500
Can I pick up the-

1828
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,300
Can I call somebody?

1829
01:54:26,939 --> 01:54:29,050
I saw what you did.

1830
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:31,369
Keep the payments coming and nobody has to find out.

1831
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,050
Yeah, okay.

1832
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:33,850
Love you too, mom.

1833
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,460
Oh, mom!

1834
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:39,689
No, that doesn't mean anything.

1835
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:40,189
Never mind.

1836
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,600
Roadkill calendar.

1837
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:45,760
The endangered Point Arena Mountain Beaver.

1838
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:49,039
Just yards away from a wildlife preserve.

1839
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:50,720
Better luck next time, little guy.

1840
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,220
Jesus.

1841
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:54,340
All right.

1842
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:56,649
What about the rat hole?

1843
01:54:57,369 --> 01:54:58,090
Anybody home?

1844
01:54:59,449 --> 01:54:59,949
Guess not.

1845
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:02,399
Well, what would you know?

1846
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:06,159
The crucial piece of evidence in the Hudson River Merman Strangler case.

1847
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:07,680
I'll have to remember to file that once-

1848
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:08,960
Is that what you say when you call home?

1849
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:11,090
No.

1850
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:12,829
I do not call my mother and say,

1851
01:55:12,829 --> 01:55:14,350
Mom, give me money.

1852
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:16,050
No.

1853
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,420
Wee!

1854
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:29,840
President Moon.

1855
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:35,710
Moon picture.

1856
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:38,750
The moon was a lot nicer when it was still hard to get to.

1857
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,819
Make somebody in the closet throw up.

1858
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:52,000
Okay, this guy has tape on his mouth.

1859
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:57,600
You want me to make the guy that puked that is tied up with a tape on his mouth?

1860
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:00,939
Are you serious?

1861
01:56:01,579 --> 01:56:02,439
Hey, Leonard.

1862
01:56:02,439 --> 01:56:03,159
How's it going?

1863
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:15,560
Oh, that was-

1864
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:17,720
Hey, looks like your paperwork finally came through.

1865
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,279
You guys cheated.

1866
01:56:18,279 --> 01:56:21,079
It's the deed to the United States and it's still moist.

1867
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:23,380
Oh.

1868
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:32,859
Okay.

1869
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:36,090
Yeah, that was really messed up.

1870
01:56:47,369 --> 01:56:48,649
Use the deed.

1871
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:49,609
Use the deed.

1872
01:56:50,489 --> 01:56:51,449
What, use the deed?

1873
01:56:52,489 --> 01:56:53,130
Well, hold on.

1874
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:53,630
Let me-

1875
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:56,010
Every time I pop in a tape, it's a mess.

1876
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,010
Eat the deed.

1877
01:57:06,569 --> 01:57:07,449
Eat the deed.

1878
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:09,289
Stop reading chat.

1879
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:10,890
Well, I-

1880
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:13,210
Look, sometimes it's gonna fall through the cracks when I see that.

1881
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:17,840
Okay, so.

1882
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:20,560
I'm gonna show her the unicorn.

1883
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:33,180
Eat the debris.

1884
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,220
Steal the china.

1885
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:36,960
Steal the china.

1886
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,760
Steal.

1887
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,520
All right, let's go here.

1888
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,020
Look.

1889
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,060
No.

1890
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,479
Max and I made civil throw up once before and that's something I never want to see again.

1891
01:57:51,789 --> 01:57:54,029
You look like you're in a shopping mood.

1892
01:57:54,029 --> 01:57:56,670
Might you be interested in, say, the United States?

1893
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,270
What's the national debt?

1894
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:58,770
How much is it?

1895
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:01,550
Oh, lovely. We can call it Lower Saskatchewan.

1896
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,189
What a perfectly delightful name.

1897
01:58:04,189 --> 01:58:05,630
Kid, for the tune of 100 trillion.

1898
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:06,829
How much do you want to spend?

1899
01:58:06,829 --> 01:58:10,909
Oh, such a grand country deserves a grand price.

1900
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:15,869
We simply refuse to buy it for less than 100 trillion dollars.

1901
01:58:15,869 --> 01:58:17,069
It's only fair.

1902
01:58:17,789 --> 01:58:19,390
We wouldn't hear of it.

1903
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:20,670
That's far too much.

1904
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,590
I'll handle this, Mr. President.

1905
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,430
If you insist, Your Highness.

1906
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,470
Is cash all right?

1907
01:58:26,029 --> 01:58:29,149
We've been dying to use the new Canadian trillion dollar notes.

1908
01:58:29,789 --> 01:58:31,390
Is that a picture of Celine Dion?

1909
01:58:31,949 --> 01:58:33,310
She's a national treasure.

1910
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:34,510
Trillion dollar note.

1911
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:40,960
Just did that in front of Abe Lincoln.

1912
01:58:42,109 --> 01:58:43,069
All right, let's go get it.

1913
01:58:54,029 --> 01:58:55,069
I got paid in Canadian.

1914
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:11,560
Earthquake, then earthquake, and I'm good to go.

1915
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,520
All right, let's have it.

1916
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:23,739
We want to buy something.

1917
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:28,000
We want to buy the Earthquake Maker.

1918
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,279
Here you go, Bosco.

1919
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:29,779
Thank you.

1920
01:59:29,779 --> 01:59:32,159
100 trillion in completely non-counterfeit bills.

1921
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,380
Queen's...

1922
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:34,079
Let me look at that.

1923
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,479
Celine Dion.

1924
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:38,640
OK, looks good to me.

1925
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,960
Here's your Earthquake Maker.

1926
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:42,479
A remote control?

1927
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:43,359
Don't get me wrong.

1928
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:46,079
I love TV as much as the next guy, but...

1929
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:48,880
It controls my satellite defense system.

1930
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,520
Only one button to work.

1931
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,800
Satellite defense.

1932
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,880
Just press it for an earthquake.

1933
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:56,319
And this adheres, I hope, to all reasonable safety guidelines.

1934
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:57,439
This is a real earthquake maker.

1935
01:59:57,439 --> 01:59:58,880
Who knows?

1936
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,760
One more thing.

1937
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,119
You have to be in range of the satellite for it to work.

1938
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:03,600
All right.

1939
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,800
Where'd you park it?

1940
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:08,880
For some reason, I was suspicious of those blessed people on the moon.

1941
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,359
It's on the moon.

1942
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:11,039
So I left it up there.

1943
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:12,720
How silly of me.

1944
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,920
Got to use it on the moon.

1945
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:14,720
Check.

1946
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:17,199
Thank you, and goodbye, Brother Bosco.

1947
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:21,359
All right.

1948
02:00:23,369 --> 02:00:27,050
This prismatology nonsense really gets my blood boiling.

1949
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:31,449
That's from the heat generated by the limitless energy of your imagination.

1950
02:00:31,449 --> 02:00:31,930
What?

1951
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:32,170
OK.

1952
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:36,250
My limitless imagination is going to cause an aneurysm if you don't stop talking like that, Max.

1953
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:38,729
What color of the rainbow would I be, would you say?

1954
02:00:39,609 --> 02:00:40,329
What do you guys think?

1955
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:45,630
Never mind.

1956
02:00:49,689 --> 02:00:51,930
Like, by personality and everything about me.

1957
02:00:51,930 --> 02:00:52,409
What would it be?

1958
02:00:56,569 --> 02:00:57,289
Piss brown.

1959
02:00:57,930 --> 02:01:00,829
That's not a color of the rainbow.

1960
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:07,550
Piss brown?

1961
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:08,430
Oh my god.

1962
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:10,750
I know what that looks like.

1963
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:12,680
To the moon, Alice.

1964
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:17,739
Do you ever have like a dark brown piss and you're just going,

1965
02:01:17,739 --> 02:01:19,739
holy shit, man, I got to drink some water?

1966
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:22,649
It's happened like maybe twice in my whole life.

1967
02:01:39,739 --> 02:01:39,979
All right.

1968
02:01:39,979 --> 02:01:41,420
So we're going to earthquake him.

1969
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,939
Earthquake maker remote.

1970
02:01:44,939 --> 02:01:47,020
Let's put the quake under here.

1971
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:49,260
Let's see if I can get any reception for this thing here.

1972
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,720
This isn't, I don't know.

1973
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,079
I don't have brown pee, guys.

1974
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:55,560
Don't worry.

1975
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:01,659
Well, shame on you, Sam.

1976
02:02:01,659 --> 02:02:02,300
Cut the tail.

1977
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:02,859
Cut the tail.

1978
02:02:03,579 --> 02:02:04,060
Cut tail.

1979
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:05,420
I'll miss you, little pal.

1980
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:05,979
Come on.

1981
02:02:05,979 --> 02:02:07,020
Is the streamer listening to me?

1982
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:07,500
Cut tail.

1983
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:09,960
Why is he not listening to me?

1984
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:10,520
Cut the tail.

1985
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,720
I'm going to be needing your tail.

1986
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:12,439
He's not doing it.

1987
02:02:12,439 --> 02:02:13,720
My little buddy back together.

1988
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:14,439
He's not doing it.

1989
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:16,439
Whatever.

1990
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:17,880
Sam, what are you doing?

1991
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,319
You may not want to watch this.

1992
02:02:21,369 --> 02:02:21,689
Nice.

1993
02:02:22,329 --> 02:02:22,970
Kick cocky.

1994
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:23,529
Cut tail.

1995
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:24,569
Good job.

1996
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:28,329
All of a sudden I feel like watching TV and eating orange marshmallow.

1997
02:02:28,329 --> 02:02:33,609
I was so invested and involved in an item that he's not going to use that no one uses.

1998
02:02:34,569 --> 02:02:34,890
Cut it.

1999
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:36,489
Have I been away, Sam?

2000
02:02:36,489 --> 02:02:38,010
In a manner of speaking.

2001
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:41,930
Hugh Bliss split you into pieces so you've kind of been all over the place.

2002
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:43,050
Hugh Bliss.

2003
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:47,850
I hate that guy now with his phony smile and his artificial happy happy.

2004
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:51,130
What do you say we tar and feather that self-righteous jerk?

2005
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:53,050
Good to have you back, little buddy.

2006
02:02:53,050 --> 02:02:55,930
Time to get ourselves some good old-fashioned payback.

2007
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:58,409
And incidentally save the world in the process.

2008
02:02:58,409 --> 02:02:59,449
What are we waiting for?

2009
02:03:00,569 --> 02:03:04,890
He did end up using the melted ice cream axe for a large portion of the game.

2010
02:03:06,489 --> 02:03:07,130
Yeah, I know.

2011
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:14,590
That's true.

2012
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:19,869
But I did complain about it.

2013
02:03:19,869 --> 02:03:20,670
A lot.

2014
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:22,350
I got really mad at it, remember?

2015
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:24,359
All right.

2016
02:03:24,359 --> 02:03:28,880
So let's go back and talk to Mr. Bliss.

2017
02:03:36,649 --> 02:03:37,930
Worth this item.

2018
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:43,319
What is this?

2019
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:47,000
What's this straw pole here?

2020
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,199
What color is Jeremy?

2021
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:48,840
Green.

2022
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,159
Yep.

2023
02:03:49,159 --> 02:03:49,960
All right, vote it.

2024
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:54,119
Green, yellow, red, blue, indigo, violet, orange.

2025
02:03:55,310 --> 02:03:55,869
Green.

2026
02:03:55,869 --> 02:03:56,189
All right.

2027
02:03:56,189 --> 02:03:56,909
No, green is...

2028
02:03:56,909 --> 02:03:57,869
I'm all right with green.

2029
02:03:58,590 --> 02:03:59,710
I'm winning by a lot.

2030
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:04,960
Yeah, no.

2031
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,159
Brown's not on there.

2032
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:07,760
I can see myself as a green.

2033
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:12,189
Hold on.

2034
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:13,149
Wait.

2035
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,439
Color personality test.

2036
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:26,399
Let's see if you guys are right.

2037
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,960
Taking the color personality type test.

2038
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,920
Personality color is equal to personality type.

2039
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:42,460
Okay, hold on.

2040
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,600
I'm going to take this on stream right now.

2041
02:04:49,229 --> 02:04:51,229
Damn, it's like 95 right now?

2042
02:04:51,229 --> 02:04:51,869
No, it's not.

2043
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:54,350
Is it that hot in Vegas right now?

2044
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:54,750
No.

2045
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:54,989
What?

2046
02:04:56,109 --> 02:04:56,670
That was wrong.

2047
02:04:57,390 --> 02:05:05,210
Okay, let me open this up on stream.

2048
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:07,770
And hold on.

2049
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:15,640
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

2050
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:21,039
Color personality test.

2051
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:21,760
Start the test.

2052
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,960
Okay, let me just capture it.

2053
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:31,390
I'll watch this be like...

2054
02:05:32,029 --> 02:05:39,550
There are a lot of questions on this test.

2055
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:41,069
This is going to take like a fucking...

2056
02:05:41,069 --> 02:05:42,029
At least 20 minutes.

2057
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:52,239
Why is everybody resident sleepering this?

2058
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:53,199
You don't want to see this?

2059
02:05:56,329 --> 02:05:57,050
Nobody wants...

2060
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,090
You don't want to see this?

2061
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:07,840
There's a lot of resident sleepers.

2062
02:06:08,479 --> 02:06:20,060
Okay.

2063
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:33,340
Oh, shit.

2064
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:34,539
My like window captures,

2065
02:06:34,539 --> 02:06:36,619
because I'm doing two window captures at the same time,

2066
02:06:36,619 --> 02:06:37,420
so it's fucked up.

2067
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:39,789
Uh-oh.

2068
02:06:41,739 --> 02:06:42,859
Uh-oh.

2069
02:06:42,859 --> 02:06:48,079
Oh, let me try again.

2070
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:51,260
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2071
02:06:57,180 --> 02:07:03,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2072
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:05,560
This is the shit I get drunk to see.

2073
02:07:06,279 --> 02:07:07,159
Well, all right, see?

2074
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:09,000
Then we're good.

2075
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:09,479
We're cool.

2076
02:07:14,189 --> 02:07:15,390
All right, this will work.

2077
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:19,180
One moment.

2078
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:24,569
There it is.

2079
02:07:24,569 --> 02:07:25,289
You should see it.

2080
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:34,699
All right, so here we go.

2081
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:40,460
There are so many ads on this site.

2082
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:47,319
It's kind of awful.

2083
02:07:47,319 --> 02:07:50,359
Okay, so this is the test of what color I am.

2084
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,600
How do you think other people might describe you?

2085
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:59,979
A good innovator,

2086
02:07:59,979 --> 02:08:01,180
a good creative worker,

2087
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:01,819
a good leader,

2088
02:08:01,819 --> 02:08:03,260
a good honest hard worker.

2089
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:07,920
So this is...

2090
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,880
Okay, so a good creative worker,

2091
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:13,609
a good leader,

2092
02:08:13,609 --> 02:08:14,569
let us vote.

2093
02:08:14,569 --> 02:08:16,489
No, this is what I think of myself.

2094
02:08:16,489 --> 02:08:18,409
You guys just told me what color you thought I was.

2095
02:08:22,670 --> 02:08:26,590
A good creative worker.

2096
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:30,460
Okay, next question.

2097
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:32,460
When you're given a briefing paper,

2098
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,420
what do you do with it?

2099
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:36,239
What do you mean a briefing paper?

2100
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:37,119
Send it back.

2101
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:38,560
I issue briefing papers.

2102
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,359
I don't read them.

2103
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:44,960
Skim it for the...

2104
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,520
What?

2105
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:47,600
Skim it and pretend I read it.

2106
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:48,960
Read it carefully and act on it.

2107
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,640
Rewrite it and send it back.

2108
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:56,250
I would skim it and I would pretend I read it.

2109
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:56,810
I'd be like,

2110
02:08:56,810 --> 02:08:58,329
yeah, yeah, yeah, I read the whole thing.

2111
02:08:58,329 --> 02:09:00,649
I would make sure I pulled out one or two sentences.

2112
02:09:00,649 --> 02:09:06,760
Okay, yeah, I would skim it.

2113
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:09,000
Imagine you had to put some furniture together.

2114
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,399
How would you go about it?

2115
02:09:11,399 --> 02:09:14,359
Grab all the pieces and figure it out without instructions.

2116
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,680
Follow the instructions to the letter.

2117
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,039
Get somebody else to do it

2118
02:09:18,039 --> 02:09:19,079
and supervise them.

2119
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:19,640
I wouldn't.

2120
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:25,850
I'd be building my own furniture.

2121
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:26,810
No, I wouldn't do that.

2122
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:30,539
I absolutely would not just do that.

2123
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,899
Do I want to not have a chair done correctly?

2124
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:41,689
You literally did this test yesterday?

2125
02:09:41,689 --> 02:09:42,329
That's weird.

2126
02:09:42,329 --> 02:09:42,890
Labo is...

2127
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:44,250
Yeah, I would follow the instructions.

2128
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:45,949
I would.

2129
02:09:45,949 --> 02:09:47,869
You're asked to provide an assessment of a colleague.

2130
02:09:47,869 --> 02:09:48,829
How would you approach it?

2131
02:09:50,270 --> 02:09:51,069
Discuss it with them

2132
02:09:51,069 --> 02:09:52,350
and tell them what you're doing,

2133
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:53,069
what you're going to say.

2134
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:54,680
Discuss it with them.

2135
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,720
See what they want.

2136
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:58,760
See what they want said about themselves.

2137
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:02,359
Give it to them and ask them to fill it out honestly.

2138
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:04,119
Just fill it out honestly.

2139
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:08,699
I'm definitely not this one.

2140
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:12,159
You're asked to provide it.

2141
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:15,039
I would ask them to fill it out honestly.

2142
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:22,090
Which of these things do you value the most in a relationship?

2143
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:24,329
Respect, unpredictability, companionship, interest.

2144
02:10:25,869 --> 02:10:26,670
Companionship.

2145
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:27,470
Well, okay.

2146
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:30,109
There are way too many questions for this joke.

2147
02:10:30,109 --> 02:10:31,550
This is like an 18 second joke

2148
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:32,909
and it's going to take like 25 minutes.

2149
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:34,029
I'm going to go quick.

2150
02:10:34,029 --> 02:10:34,670
Here we go.

2151
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,590
You're on the street and you see somebody in distress.

2152
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,470
How are you going to help them?

2153
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:39,600
Take charge of the whole situation.

2154
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:40,720
Go and fetch them a cup of coffee.

2155
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,640
Call for the appropriate emergency assistance.

2156
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,840
I would call for the appropriate assistance.

2157
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,199
If you can't find a solution to a problem,

2158
02:10:50,199 --> 02:10:51,560
would it most likely be because

2159
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:53,560
somebody else must have let you down?

2160
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:55,000
You haven't shown enough imagination.

2161
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,359
You haven't worked on it long enough.

2162
02:10:56,359 --> 02:10:58,520
You haven't looked at it from enough angles.

2163
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,239
Well, I look at it too much.

2164
02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:01,199
I look into that.

2165
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:02,800
I look into stuff way too many times.

2166
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:05,210
So that's definitely what it is.

2167
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:06,329
I just hadn't looked at it yet

2168
02:11:06,329 --> 02:11:08,090
from like a million different angles.

2169
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:10,680
Which of these things do you have

2170
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:13,239
do you value most about employment?

2171
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:13,880
Stimulation.

2172
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:17,479
If you overheard a colleague talking about you,

2173
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:19,399
which of these statements would upset you the most?

2174
02:11:22,829 --> 02:11:24,189
They are so conventional.

2175
02:11:24,189 --> 02:11:25,310
They are not fit to lead.

2176
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,590
Their ideas aren't very creative.

2177
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:28,430
They are not a team player.

2178
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:36,479
If a colleague is...

2179
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:38,560
Why is this all about colleagues and shit?

2180
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:40,239
Isn't this supposed to be my personality,

2181
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:41,920
not other people's personalities?

2182
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:46,119
If a colleague is upset, how would you deal with it?

2183
02:11:46,119 --> 02:11:48,010
Tell them to pull themselves together.

2184
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:49,210
Try to find a solution.

2185
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:50,890
Think of something to take their mind off it.

2186
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:51,689
Offer them a shoulder.

2187
02:11:51,689 --> 02:11:53,609
I would take something to take their mind off.

2188
02:11:55,159 --> 02:11:57,079
If you need ideas from your team for a new project,

2189
02:11:57,079 --> 02:11:58,680
how would you garner them?

2190
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:03,100
Informal meal to brainstorm.

2191
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,800
Circulate an email.

2192
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,119
Put out your own suggestions and ask for comments.

2193
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:14,090
Demanding a paper from each member.

2194
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:17,180
That would be that one.

2195
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,779
If a new system is implemented in your office,

2196
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:20,539
which of these is most likely to be your reaction?

2197
02:12:20,539 --> 02:12:21,899
It's always the office too.

2198
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:25,850
Resistance.

2199
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:27,470
Adaptation.

2200
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:28,189
I would adapt.

2201
02:12:29,369 --> 02:12:30,170
On a football team,

2202
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:31,770
which of these positions would suit you best?

2203
02:12:32,649 --> 02:12:34,920
Quarterback.

2204
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,550
Which of these activities might suit you best?

2205
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:38,029
Freerunning.

2206
02:12:38,029 --> 02:12:38,590
Running alone.

2207
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:39,710
Running a relay race.

2208
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:40,350
Running with friends.

2209
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:41,310
I don't like to run at all.

2210
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:42,189
Whereas I don't run.

2211
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:52,350
Whereas I watch people running from the stands.

2212
02:12:52,350 --> 02:12:54,909
Freerunning.

2213
02:12:54,909 --> 02:12:57,579
Because then I can stop whenever I want to.

2214
02:12:57,579 --> 02:12:59,100
If somebody at work has made you angry,

2215
02:12:59,100 --> 02:12:59,899
how do you react?

2216
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:01,500
Try and analyze what has made you angry

2217
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,220
and the reason why.

2218
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:04,539
Have a reasonable discussion.

2219
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:07,149
Attack them at every opportunity

2220
02:13:07,149 --> 02:13:12,539
or keep it to yourself and let off steam outside.

2221
02:13:12,539 --> 02:13:14,060
It is absolutely not free.

2222
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:21,609
I would probably keep it to myself

2223
02:13:21,609 --> 02:13:24,729
and just I'd keep it to myself

2224
02:13:24,729 --> 02:13:25,609
and then like go outside

2225
02:13:25,609 --> 02:13:27,689
and like scream at the moon.

2226
02:13:27,689 --> 02:13:30,010
From what you know of these countries,

2227
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:31,609
cultures, etc.

2228
02:13:31,609 --> 02:13:33,930
Where do you think you would fit in best?

2229
02:13:38,279 --> 02:13:41,720
Germany, France, China, Brazil.

2230
02:13:44,189 --> 02:13:44,750
I don't know.

2231
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:51,420
I do see come to Brazil all the time.

2232
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:53,500
I do.

2233
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:56,140
I swear to God that's not a meme or a joke.

2234
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:57,420
I see it all the time.

2235
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:02,720
Which of these would you say is your greatest fault?

2236
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:04,239
I miss details.

2237
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:05,439
I'm too ready to take orders.

2238
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:06,399
I can be too critical.

2239
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:07,760
I'm inclined to daydream.

2240
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:08,880
Definitely that one.

2241
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,960
Which of these sorts of car would you most likely choose?

2242
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:17,920
People carrier.

2243
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,359
Single seater sports.

2244
02:14:19,359 --> 02:14:20,319
Would one seat...

2245
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:25,930
Is it a go-kart?

2246
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:26,970
Probably that one.

2247
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:32,029
Which of these would you be most satisfied with

2248
02:14:32,029 --> 02:14:33,470
at the end of a project you were leading?

2249
02:14:34,109 --> 02:14:36,109
That it surpassed expectations.

2250
02:14:36,109 --> 02:14:37,149
I got the job done.

2251
02:14:37,149 --> 02:14:39,229
That everyone did as I said.

2252
02:14:39,789 --> 02:14:41,760
That it surpassed expectations.

2253
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:44,039
On a plane, do you think you would be the best

2254
02:14:44,039 --> 02:14:46,279
as a co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer,

2255
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:47,159
or chief pilot?

2256
02:14:50,029 --> 02:14:50,909
Too much.

2257
02:14:50,909 --> 02:14:51,550
Too much to do.

2258
02:14:52,270 --> 02:14:54,060
Probably co-pilot.

2259
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:56,060
Because you just have just enough responsibility

2260
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:57,020
but you're not like the...

2261
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:58,060
You're...

2262
02:14:58,060 --> 02:14:59,420
I'd be the co-pilot.

2263
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:03,289
There's an important deadline coming up

2264
02:15:03,289 --> 02:15:05,050
and it looks like your team might not make it.

2265
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:05,770
What will you do?

2266
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:09,470
Ask whether the deadline was never realistic

2267
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:10,829
and if it should be altered.

2268
02:15:10,829 --> 02:15:14,119
Drive the team onwards to work harder and harder.

2269
02:15:14,119 --> 02:15:17,130
See if there were any corners which can be cut.

2270
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:17,850
Just keep going.

2271
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:18,970
You can only do your best.

2272
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:19,689
Yep.

2273
02:15:19,689 --> 02:15:22,430
All right, I want like a reveal here.

2274
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:23,310
Hold on.

2275
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:25,359
If you were climbing up a mountain

2276
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:28,159
and a member of your team couldn't go on,

2277
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:30,119
what would you do?

2278
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:31,159
Split the team up.

2279
02:15:31,159 --> 02:15:33,000
Some to go down, some to carry on.

2280
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:35,319
Leave them with the team

2281
02:15:35,319 --> 02:15:37,159
and carry on on your own.

2282
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,439
Turn the whole team around

2283
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:41,880
but carry on with the rest

2284
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:43,159
you'll get them on the way back.

2285
02:15:49,289 --> 02:15:51,789
I don't know if I would do that.

2286
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:53,789
I would probably split up the team.

2287
02:15:53,789 --> 02:15:55,069
Some go, you know,

2288
02:15:55,069 --> 02:15:57,470
I kind of want to stay up

2289
02:15:57,470 --> 02:16:00,649
but I want to go up the mountain.

2290
02:16:00,649 --> 02:16:03,979
Yeah, I would split the team up.

2291
02:16:03,979 --> 02:16:05,340
He's going to be dead when you come back.

2292
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:06,270
Yeah.

2293
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:08,189
In a conversation, what are you aiming for?

2294
02:16:08,189 --> 02:16:09,390
A solution, inspiration,

2295
02:16:09,390 --> 02:16:11,390
a consensus, agreement, inspiration.

2296
02:16:11,390 --> 02:16:14,909
What is your attitude to workplace friendships?

2297
02:16:14,909 --> 02:16:19,640
They are a good thing if they happen.

2298
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:21,479
They have no bearing on success or failure.

2299
02:16:21,479 --> 02:16:23,000
They should grow organically, right?

2300
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:23,880
Yeah, yeah.

2301
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,840
Last one.

2302
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:27,680
Which of these things make you the happiest?

2303
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,359
A life in which others look up to me.

2304
02:16:29,359 --> 02:16:32,479
A life in which I plowed my own furrow.

2305
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,079
A quiet, contended life.

2306
02:16:34,079 --> 02:16:35,360
A happy, exciting life.

2307
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:35,760
Are you ready?

2308
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:36,159
Here you go.

2309
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:36,719
Let's see.

2310
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,090
Green.

2311
02:16:38,090 --> 02:16:40,250
Green.

2312
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:40,750
No.

2313
02:16:41,930 --> 02:16:51,319
No, that's cool.

2314
02:16:51,319 --> 02:16:52,360
It's P. Brown.

2315
02:16:53,479 --> 02:16:55,799
It's not P. Brown, okay?

2316
02:16:55,799 --> 02:16:59,200
Creator, performer.

2317
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,959
You like to constantly challenge where you...

2318
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:02,239
Is that supposed to be me?

2319
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:07,450
You aren't prepared to accept the status quo

2320
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:09,290
without seeing as things can be done differently.

2321
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:10,649
You think very deeply about issues

2322
02:17:10,649 --> 02:17:12,010
and you always like to bring a new way

2323
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:13,610
of looking at things to the table.

2324
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:14,809
You're very enthusiastic

2325
02:17:14,809 --> 02:17:16,729
and will be popular with colleagues.

2326
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:18,250
You must make sure that you follow through

2327
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:20,010
in your creativity with concrete results.

2328
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,319
Nice.

2329
02:17:23,319 --> 02:17:24,120
Okay, there you go.

2330
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:24,920
I did it.

2331
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:29,790
How do I get the last 30 minutes

2332
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:42,569
of the stream back, streamer?

2333
02:17:42,569 --> 02:17:43,930
They stream sniped me.

2334
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:45,129
All right, we were going back up

2335
02:17:45,129 --> 02:17:46,489
with that earthquake weapon.

2336
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:56,059
Could have done it at the end of the stream.

2337
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:58,059
No, it was relevant right now.

2338
02:17:58,059 --> 02:17:59,020
Hey, little buddy, get him.

2339
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:01,799
Hi, I'm Hugh Blake.

2340
02:18:01,799 --> 02:18:03,239
Stop saying that!

2341
02:18:03,239 --> 02:18:03,739
Huh?

2342
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:05,500
What?

2343
02:18:07,739 --> 02:18:08,700
How did he get in there?

2344
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:10,219
You little idiot.

2345
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:12,219
You've ruined my hypno beam.

2346
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:14,219
I should have killed you earlier,

2347
02:18:14,219 --> 02:18:15,739
but what can I say?

2348
02:18:15,739 --> 02:18:16,780
I'm too nice.

2349
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,739
That said, die, buddy!

2350
02:18:20,219 --> 02:18:20,719
Wrong.

2351
02:18:24,409 --> 02:18:26,809
What the?

2352
02:18:26,809 --> 02:18:27,770
Where you at?

2353
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,840
We are a space-faring colony

2354
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:34,879
of sentient bacteria.

2355
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,440
A sentence I really did not

2356
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,399
expect to hear today.

2357
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:41,600
We cannot be harmed by bullets.

2358
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,319
We only need one thing, to feed.

2359
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:48,399
You see, we feed on the endorphins

2360
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:52,000
produced by humans experiencing true bliss.

2361
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
So, you don't care if people

2362
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,120
are happy at all.

2363
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,879
You just want to eat till you drop.

2364
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:58,319
Yes.

2365
02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:00,000
Hey, I hear that.

2366
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,680
But you want us to starve.

2367
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:03,840
And for that, you will die.

2368
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:07,280
In the most fantastic display

2369
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:10,719
of the universe!

2370
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:12,559
Hey, gotta look good for the cameras.

2371
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:13,680
What cameras?

2372
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,120
Pack your bags, Sam,

2373
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:17,200
because you just want an all-expense

2374
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:19,120
day trip to your grave.

2375
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,639
So who killed him?

2376
02:19:20,639 --> 02:19:22,239
And you get to watch him die.

2377
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,159
Let the magic begin.

2378
02:19:28,969 --> 02:19:30,409
Ladies and gentlemen,

2379
02:19:30,409 --> 02:19:32,729
for my first trick, I give you

2380
02:19:32,729 --> 02:19:35,610
the Rainbow Wheel of Death!

2381
02:19:36,729 --> 02:19:45,450
Also known as Emetics, the ride.

2382
02:19:45,450 --> 02:19:47,690
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

2383
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,889
Add to Rainbow Wheel.

2384
02:19:48,889 --> 02:19:49,450
Not yet.

2385
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:50,010
Exactly.

2386
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:50,409
Not yet.

2387
02:19:50,409 --> 02:19:51,450
Throw some daggers.

2388
02:19:51,450 --> 02:19:52,969
No, hatchets!

2389
02:19:52,969 --> 02:19:53,850
Hey.

2390
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:55,530
Sorry, I got excited.

2391
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:57,450
I've got a better idea.

2392
02:19:57,450 --> 02:19:59,209
I'll just torture him mercilessly

2393
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:00,170
until he begs me to shoot him

2394
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,969
with his own gun.

2395
02:20:04,989 --> 02:20:05,709
Oh, well.

2396
02:20:05,709 --> 02:20:06,190
What's this?

2397
02:20:08,969 --> 02:20:09,530
What is that?

2398
02:20:11,229 --> 02:20:12,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2399
02:20:12,430 --> 02:20:13,149
Spoon, Ben.

2400
02:20:13,149 --> 02:20:13,549
Spoon.

2401
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:21,260
All right.

2402
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,620
That Willy Mays never caught one

2403
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:24,059
while spinning on a Wheel of Death.

2404
02:20:25,739 --> 02:20:27,420
Okay, and then we've got...

2405
02:20:29,559 --> 02:20:32,200
I have the Magician's Talisman Earthquake.

2406
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,040
I don't think that's gonna...

2407
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:34,540
No.

2408
02:20:37,719 --> 02:20:38,760
Put that back up here.

2409
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,959
I think it only works on things

2410
02:20:39,959 --> 02:20:40,600
with stomachs.

2411
02:20:41,079 --> 02:20:42,600
Evil laugh.

2412
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,079
And break magic rings.

2413
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:46,719
Can't escape.

2414
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:49,739
Magic junk.

2415
02:20:49,739 --> 02:20:50,459
I'm stuck.

2416
02:20:50,459 --> 02:20:54,840
I just bend them all?

2417
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:10,409
Uh, what?

2418
02:21:10,409 --> 02:21:12,329
So that's how magicians switch places

2419
02:21:12,329 --> 02:21:13,209
with people.

2420
02:21:13,209 --> 02:21:14,010
By magic.

2421
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:15,450
Oh, in retrospect?

2422
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:16,489
So now he's stuck there.

2423
02:21:16,489 --> 02:21:17,530
I probably shouldn't have left

2424
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:18,489
that lying around.

2425
02:21:18,489 --> 02:21:19,690
Way to go, Sam!

2426
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:20,489
You did it!

2427
02:21:20,489 --> 02:21:20,969
Thanks, Willy.

2428
02:21:20,969 --> 02:21:22,010
It was that easy, apparently.

2429
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:23,129
Frankly, I wish it had been

2430
02:21:23,129 --> 02:21:24,569
a little more challenging.

2431
02:21:24,569 --> 02:21:25,290
Kind of a letdown.

2432
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:26,010
That's what I'm saying.

2433
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:26,489
Excuse me?

2434
02:21:27,209 --> 02:21:29,450
I think you're forgetting something.

2435
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:31,290
You forget something?

2436
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:31,690
Me?

2437
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:32,090
No.

2438
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:32,489
I don't know.

2439
02:21:35,770 --> 02:21:36,620
Oh, yeah.

2440
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,420
Oh.

2441
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:38,940
My magic eight ball told me

2442
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:41,180
to bring my antibacterial soap today.

2443
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:42,540
Why didn't I listen?

2444
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:46,059
Next up, the number one magic trick

2445
02:21:46,059 --> 02:21:49,500
at every priest modality party.

2446
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,979
It's time to separate your bliss!

2447
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:53,899
No, not that.

2448
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:55,899
Don't worry.

2449
02:21:55,899 --> 02:21:57,260
This won't hurt a bit.

2450
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:59,260
Until the saw hits you.

2451
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:00,379
Then you'll die!

2452
02:22:00,379 --> 02:22:01,899
Cruesome!

2453
02:22:01,899 --> 02:22:02,540
I love it!

2454
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:03,180
This guy's terrifying.

2455
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:12,000
All right.

2456
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,200
Well, I have like a second here.

2457
02:22:15,309 --> 02:22:15,870
Switch with him.

2458
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:19,159
Swap all you want.

2459
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:20,600
It drives the crowd wild.

2460
02:22:21,799 --> 02:22:23,479
Saw us, Sam!

2461
02:22:23,479 --> 02:22:24,680
We dare you.

2462
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:25,479
Maybe I will.

2463
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:27,229
All right.

2464
02:22:27,229 --> 02:22:27,709
Don't saw.

2465
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:29,229
Don't saw.

2466
02:22:29,229 --> 02:22:29,709
Don't do it.

2467
02:22:32,030 --> 02:22:33,870
You're supposed to saw me.

2468
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,670
Cue bliss!

2469
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:40,040
For my next trick, I present to you...

2470
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:40,920
Saw his head.

2471
02:22:41,559 --> 02:22:42,680
I'm not gonna do that.

2472
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,479
The lunar lander?

2473
02:22:45,479 --> 02:22:47,719
It's the ticket to oblivion.

2474
02:22:50,989 --> 02:22:52,670
Enjoy your stay in outer space.

2475
02:22:53,389 --> 02:22:54,909
Until you die!

2476
02:22:57,469 --> 02:22:58,430
I think I know what to do here.

2477
02:22:59,709 --> 02:23:02,030
Lock the door and then switch.

2478
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:08,729
Or not.

2479
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:11,159
Sam!

2480
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:17,020
I'll give the guy one thing.

2481
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:18,379
He does put on a good show.

2482
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:20,799
Okay.

2483
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:21,600
So we are now...

2484
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:24,809
Lock the door.

2485
02:23:24,809 --> 02:23:25,770
I can't do that now.

2486
02:23:26,489 --> 02:23:29,639
What do you mean, you can't do that now?

2487
02:23:29,639 --> 02:23:30,600
I can't do that now.

2488
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:32,120
I don't know.

2489
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:33,479
That first step is a doozy.

2490
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,000
I mean, I could switch with him.

2491
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,840
But do I do something like just do...

2492
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:37,399
Earthquake?

2493
02:23:37,399 --> 02:23:39,000
I don't think that's gonna work again.

2494
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,540
Lock the door from the inside.

2495
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:47,180
And then he won't be able to unlock it from the inside.

2496
02:23:48,139 --> 02:23:48,620
Right.

2497
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:50,219
You know, that's a good point.

2498
02:23:50,219 --> 02:23:51,739
But I'm just trying to think a thing.

2499
02:23:51,739 --> 02:23:52,459
It's a cartoon.

2500
02:23:52,459 --> 02:23:53,260
It's like a rocket engine.

2501
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:53,659
I don't know.

2502
02:23:54,219 --> 02:24:00,639
This is fun.

2503
02:24:02,459 --> 02:24:04,379
It's okay, everyone.

2504
02:24:04,379 --> 02:24:05,500
I'm all right.

2505
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:09,739
I heard that.

2506
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,049
Consider this.

2507
02:24:13,049 --> 02:24:15,290
A trap so deadly it would cause you to die.

2508
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:17,370
That is deadly.

2509
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:20,969
It's the cleansing path of annihilation.

2510
02:24:22,809 --> 02:24:24,170
Oh, could we skip this one?

2511
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:25,690
I kind of have a thing about drowning.

2512
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:27,209
Oh, let me think.

2513
02:24:27,209 --> 02:24:27,770
No!

2514
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:28,489
Don't drown, Sam!

2515
02:24:28,489 --> 02:24:30,010
So do I just keep switching with him?

2516
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:30,569
Switch, little buddy.

2517
02:24:30,569 --> 02:24:31,450
That's such a boring way to die.

2518
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:31,770
Oh, shit.

2519
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:32,729
It's a dunk tank.

2520
02:24:32,729 --> 02:24:34,809
Try to get cut in half instead.

2521
02:24:34,809 --> 02:24:35,930
Thanks, little buddy.

2522
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:39,799
Well, water tank.

2523
02:24:39,799 --> 02:24:41,479
I can only hold my breath for nine minutes.

2524
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:43,000
I don't think...

2525
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,520
I think I just got...

2526
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:46,440
Is it just as simple as one, two, three?

2527
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:52,989
Wait!

2528
02:24:52,989 --> 02:24:54,430
Bacteria can't drown!

2529
02:24:54,430 --> 02:24:55,149
Woohoo!

2530
02:24:55,149 --> 02:24:55,629
So I just...

2531
02:24:55,629 --> 02:24:56,909
I'm gonna have to anti-bacteria something.

2532
02:24:56,909 --> 02:24:59,520
Shut up!

2533
02:24:59,520 --> 02:24:59,760
All right.

2534
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:00,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2535
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:00,879
Wait, hold on.

2536
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,559
I have a second here.

2537
02:25:03,899 --> 02:25:04,540
Bacteria.

2538
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:06,750
The guy pissing the tank?

2539
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:14,399
Oh, no.

2540
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:15,360
We have to do this again.

2541
02:25:19,129 --> 02:25:22,860
Magic junk.

2542
02:25:23,579 --> 02:25:25,760
Magic salt box.

2543
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:31,639
So it seems like...

2544
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,600
He's gonna keep going around.

2545
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,200
I can't go anywhere but here.

2546
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:47,760
Maybe I can...

2547
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:48,260
Hold on.

2548
02:25:48,659 --> 02:25:57,170
Attack the dog!

2549
02:25:57,889 --> 02:26:01,520
What if I switch back?

2550
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:02,479
I can't do that now.

2551
02:26:06,209 --> 02:26:07,889
Oh, well, now I can actually...

2552
02:26:16,530 --> 02:26:19,680
Just let him do it.

2553
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:22,719
Having my bliss separated is not what the brochures made it.

2554
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:23,760
I need to like...

2555
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:24,559
I don't get...

2556
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,639
I have to go pick up stuff.

2557
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,000
Can I make a puke?

2558
02:26:34,879 --> 02:26:35,440
I'm just gonna do it.

2559
02:26:51,659 --> 02:26:54,299
I definitely have to play anti-bacteria.

2560
02:26:58,719 --> 02:27:07,379
Okay.

2561
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:10,989
Anti-bacteria.

2562
02:27:16,129 --> 02:27:16,850
Here it comes again.

2563
02:27:19,489 --> 02:27:20,610
What's that on the table?

2564
02:27:25,739 --> 02:27:26,379
All right, so hold on.

2565
02:27:26,379 --> 02:27:27,180
Magic junk.

2566
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:29,500
Microphone.

2567
02:27:30,459 --> 02:27:31,100
Crystals.

2568
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:33,979
How do I get over there?

2569
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,200
Okay, now magic crystals.

2570
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:50,959
No, I can't move.

2571
02:27:52,879 --> 02:27:54,239
I have to bend shit then.

2572
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:54,719
I have to...

2573
02:27:54,719 --> 02:27:55,219
No.

2574
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:00,530
Is there anything I can bend from here?

2575
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:01,649
Like this magic junk there?

2576
02:28:05,170 --> 02:28:08,590
He's impervious to gastro-kinesis.

2577
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:09,069
He can't...

2578
02:28:09,069 --> 02:28:10,030
I can't make him throw up.

2579
02:28:28,909 --> 02:28:30,860
I mean, I can bend these,

2580
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:34,129
but it doesn't really do much for me.

2581
02:28:40,219 --> 02:28:49,500
He had another spoon.

2582
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:50,139
Another spoon.

2583
02:28:50,139 --> 02:28:50,540
Spoon.

2584
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:51,040
Spoon.

2585
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:53,500
Shoot him.

2586
02:28:54,299 --> 02:28:54,940
I can't kill him.

2587
02:29:00,930 --> 02:29:01,809
Magic rings.

2588
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:08,340
You can't kill bacteria.

2589
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:08,899
That's true.

2590
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:16,399
Bullets won't hurt bacteria.

2591
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:21,069
They match the items with the spoons.

2592
02:29:21,069 --> 02:29:21,870
That's what I was thinking too.

2593
02:29:21,870 --> 02:29:23,149
Maybe just put them back up there,

2594
02:29:23,149 --> 02:29:23,709
but I can't...

2595
02:29:23,709 --> 02:29:25,629
I think it only works on things with stomachs.

2596
02:29:25,629 --> 02:29:26,510
I can't put them up there.

2597
02:29:28,989 --> 02:29:31,629
You have to shoot each individual bacteria.

2598
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:32,750
Next up.

2599
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:38,799
I'm trapped.

2600
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:40,479
Anything else over here?

2601
02:29:40,479 --> 02:29:40,959
Annoying...

2602
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,840
Not one of those 3D images.

2603
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,760
If God had wanted pictures to be 3D,

2604
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:46,959
he wouldn't have made them 2D.

2605
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:50,799
Can I bend it?

2606
02:29:50,799 --> 02:29:51,280
Earthquake.

2607
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:55,920
Evil Gumball!

2608
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:56,719
No, nothing.

2609
02:30:01,139 --> 02:30:02,260
Saw us, Sam!

2610
02:30:03,459 --> 02:30:04,500
All right, I'm just gonna walk.

2611
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:06,979
Next up.

2612
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:08,260
Oblivion.

2613
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:14,850
Saw the Lander.

2614
02:30:16,129 --> 02:30:18,270
He doesn't let me move.

2615
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:24,610
Nope, not spoon-y enough.

2616
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:27,309
I can't escape.

2617
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:28,510
I don't know.

2618
02:30:29,790 --> 02:30:34,940
May I spoon on the saw?

2619
02:30:38,479 --> 02:30:39,280
Bring this down here.

2620
02:30:44,799 --> 02:30:46,319
All right, switch it again.

2621
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,139
Now, hold on.

2622
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:53,260
There's a lock.

2623
02:30:54,739 --> 02:30:55,860
There's the crystals.

2624
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:56,899
There's the water tank.

2625
02:30:57,700 --> 02:30:58,739
What if I break the tank,

2626
02:30:58,739 --> 02:30:59,379
and I shoot the tank,

2627
02:30:59,379 --> 02:31:00,100
and I explode?

2628
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:10,690
I don't think this is gonna work.

2629
02:31:19,629 --> 02:31:20,829
You have to dissolve them.

2630
02:31:20,829 --> 02:31:21,629
That's not gonna work.

2631
02:31:27,069 --> 02:31:27,469
All right.

2632
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:29,979
Keep going.

2633
02:31:29,979 --> 02:31:30,479
Saw.

2634
02:31:34,290 --> 02:31:36,129
All right, switch.

2635
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:41,870
Put Bleach in the tank.

2636
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:44,739
I didn't think I could move.

2637
02:31:44,979 --> 02:31:46,180
I didn't think I could move.

2638
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:47,299
Why is he letting me do this?

2639
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:50,799
He freezes me every other time.

2640
02:32:06,209 --> 02:32:09,420
Wait, I still have to stop each one of these

2641
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:10,299
from being able to do...

2642
02:32:10,299 --> 02:32:11,020
Okay, I get it.

2643
02:32:11,739 --> 02:32:12,239
So...

2644
02:32:12,239 --> 02:32:14,959
Blending bath of annihilation!

2645
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:17,969
So what's the deal here, then?

2646
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:19,649
Okay, um...

2647
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:22,200
Key?

2648
02:32:23,379 --> 02:32:24,100
No, no, no.

2649
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,760
I need to make it so this is not functional.

2650
02:32:35,159 --> 02:32:36,920
I can't do that in this predicament.

2651
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:37,420
Why not?

2652
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:43,000
I'm stuck.

2653
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:47,479
No, I tried to shoot the lock,

2654
02:32:47,479 --> 02:32:48,280
but the lock didn't work.

2655
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:50,819
I can't pull the gun out.

2656
02:32:59,139 --> 02:32:59,639
Wait.

2657
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:00,979
No, like, can I do this?

2658
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:07,590
The door's just open.

2659
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:15,459
Oh, I'm boiling to the life!

2660
02:33:27,350 --> 02:33:27,909
That was it?

2661
02:33:31,909 --> 02:33:32,790
Just boil him?

2662
02:33:33,829 --> 02:33:34,549
That's the end?

2663
02:33:35,350 --> 02:33:36,229
Oh my god.

2664
02:33:40,549 --> 02:34:05,000
Is that season one complete?

2665
02:34:05,559 --> 02:34:07,649
I think that's it for season one.

2666
02:34:08,290 --> 02:34:11,250
Is there a secret at the end?

2667
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:13,969
Hey, season one.

2668
02:34:13,969 --> 02:34:21,329
Is there a post-credit scene?

2669
02:34:32,079 --> 02:34:39,649
Why would you do that?

2670
02:34:43,729 --> 02:34:44,690
Bright side of the moon.

2671
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:48,799
That was cool.

2672
02:34:55,250 --> 02:34:57,250
Oh, you're unhypnotizing everybody, I see.

2673
02:35:14,979 --> 02:35:15,459
That's fun.

2674
02:35:15,459 --> 02:35:16,899
It's fun just playing these games.

2675
02:35:16,899 --> 02:35:17,940
Just kind of...

2676
02:35:17,940 --> 02:35:19,219
I love the hangout.

2677
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:19,860
Just chill.

2678
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:24,950
Play Sam and Max.

2679
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:27,639
I would do something like The Walking Dead,

2680
02:35:27,639 --> 02:35:28,680
but I already did them all.

2681
02:35:38,049 --> 02:35:41,440
If you play Puzzle Agent,

2682
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:45,360
I have you're probably wondering,

2683
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:46,159
well, if you like this,

2684
02:35:46,159 --> 02:35:47,920
why play all these other ones?

2685
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:48,959
I've probably played them all.

2686
02:35:50,930 --> 02:35:52,049
Wolf Among Us, I've already done it.

2687
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:54,049
What's going on on the screen?

2688
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:02,790
And those experiences,

2689
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:04,950
you kind of experience it

2690
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:06,069
and then you don't again.

2691
02:36:07,379 --> 02:36:08,899
So if I want to play season one

2692
02:36:08,899 --> 02:36:10,420
or season two of The Walking Dead

2693
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,459
or The Wolf Among Us,

2694
02:36:11,459 --> 02:36:13,459
I already know the story

2695
02:36:13,459 --> 02:36:14,260
and I know what happens.

2696
02:36:15,059 --> 02:36:18,079
I wouldn't really want to play them again on stream.

2697
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:29,030
You played all the post-Walking Dead stuff?

2698
02:36:29,030 --> 02:36:29,530
Yes.

2699
02:36:31,459 --> 02:36:34,479
No, I did not do Minecraft story mode

2700
02:36:34,479 --> 02:36:35,280
and I don't...

2701
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:38,000
I'm not going to do Minecraft story mode.

2702
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:38,719
It's not going to happen.

2703
02:36:41,239 --> 02:36:44,360
No.

2704
02:36:53,909 --> 02:36:55,590
You signed yourself up now?

2705
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:57,829
No, I did not.

2706
02:36:58,549 --> 02:36:59,430
I just told you no.

2707
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:17,059
I played Grim Fandango.

2708
02:37:17,059 --> 02:37:17,559
Yes, I have.

2709
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,760
Play season two, you mean right now?

2710
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,040
We have a couple options.

2711
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,840
I'm going to take a piss.

2712
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:45,040
We'll come back and we'll assess our options.

2713
02:37:46,079 --> 02:37:47,120
There are a couple things to do.

2714
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:57,889
But I do want to see this ending credit sequence

2715
02:37:57,889 --> 02:37:59,250
because it is very, very fun.

2716
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:05,510
Play episode one of Minecraft story mode.

2717
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:06,629
I'm not doing that.

2718
02:38:09,909 --> 02:38:12,309
I'm going to have to be an eight or a nine out of 10

2719
02:38:12,309 --> 02:38:16,549
shit-faced for you guys to convince me on that stream

2720
02:38:16,549 --> 02:38:18,629
to play Minecraft story mode episode one.

2721
02:38:20,309 --> 02:38:21,270
2007.

2722
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:21,770
Wow.

2723
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:27,350
It was a long time ago.

2724
02:38:28,950 --> 02:38:39,319
My website is down.

2725
02:38:39,319 --> 02:38:40,200
I would assume it is.

2726
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:41,569
Well, there you go.

2727
02:38:41,569 --> 02:38:42,450
That's season one complete.

2728
02:38:43,459 --> 02:38:44,100
It was cool.

2729
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:44,600
It was fun.

2730
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:47,350
I'm going to go pee.

2731
02:38:47,909 --> 02:38:48,629
I'll be right back.

2732
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:51,350
And we will figure out what are we going to do

2733
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:52,549
for the remainder of the stream.

2734
02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:55,510
See you guys in like two minutes, three minutes,

2735
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:56,709
something like that.

2736
02:38:56,709 --> 02:38:58,069
Be right back.
