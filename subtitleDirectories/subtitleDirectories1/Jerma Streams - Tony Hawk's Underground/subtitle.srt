1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,299
Hey. Yeah, we're early. Very early, actually. Almost an hour early.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:15,699
Uh, I'm just, I'm ready. I'm ready. You know how sometimes I tell you guys that sometimes

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:24,039
I sit here and I'm just all set up. Things work. Everything's ready to go. And it's like 45 minutes

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:33,130
to stream time. No, no, no, no, no. We're going now. I'm ready now. I'm that kind of person where

5
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:41,289
I've had a show and I went on stage and the show was seven o'clock. People are funneling in at like

6
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:48,020
six 30 getting their seats. I, if I was ready, I would just come out and just start talking to

7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,799
people. It's like, Hey, I'm, I'm ready to start my show. I was, I would be, can I have a mic?

8
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,240
And I would just, it'd be addressing people as they walked in to get their seats.

9
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,659
And then it'd be like, all right, six, it's like, it's seven o'clock. All right, now we can do the

10
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:09,879
show. It would be pissed to start the show like 40 minutes early. People walk in. It's 20 minutes

11
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:16,140
till the show's over. Oh, sorry, guys. I really just had to, I really wanted to start. Be like,

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Dickhead, these tickets were $285. They're in the front row and it says there's a meet and greet

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,769
after. Is that still happening? I don't feel like doing that anymore. Dude, I got free tickets to

14
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,849
the Jerma string. Yeah. Well, we had to start giving them away free because I didn't really

15
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,840
get any money to come and pay for it. Anyways, we're gonna play Tony Hawk's Underground today.

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:58,439
It's all ready to go. It works. This is, if you're wondering the platform, this is X-Box,

17
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:06,819
X-Box that has been upscaled to 1080 through backwards compatibility with 360.

18
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,169
That's where we're at. That's why I'm playing it in 360. It should look a little crusty,

19
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:18,250
but not too crusty where it's gonna be annoying. I don't know. We'll find out.

20
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:24,280
Just say you pirated it. Just say you pirated it. No one will care.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,979
I didn't. I got a 360 right next to me. I had to get a 360 hard drive.

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm playing this on a 360 right now. That's what it is. But there's not much else to say besides,

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:49,780
here we go. By the way, I think I'm gonna keep original music. So this entire VOD is gonna be

24
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:58,680
deleted. There might be like 10 seconds of this VOD that is watchable. I'm really sorry, those of

25
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,430
you that are VOD watchers. But the last time we did this, we played Tony Hawk 2. No, don't,

26
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,569
spoilers. We played Tony Hawk 2 and I think I muted the music and it just fucked it all up.

27
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,120
It just didn't feel right. It felt off. Is there skateboarding in this game?

28
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:28,599
Yep. No, you didn't. Oh, so Jeremy lied about turning the music off in

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,840
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast. I don't think you can even make a username that long,

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,699
so don't even try it. All right, I'm ready. Let's go. So there's the story mode. I'm gonna

31
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:48,620
do the story mode because that's obviously the easiest thing to do. I need to make a skater too,

32
00:03:48,620 --> 00:04:01,659
don't I? Let's create a skater to use in story mode. Stream will be chugging in just a moment.

33
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:13,460
Please up the game volume. Oh, let's see what it looks like first. All right, so

34
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:23,800
create new, create a new skater. That's like a Neversoft developer. Okay. Any unsaved changes

35
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,160
to your current story that don't matter. All right, pre-made skaters.

36
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:51,319
Pre-made Steve, Becky, Mike, Jim, Chad, Joey, Sheena, Josh, Andy, Liz, Jack. Are these all

37
00:04:51,319 --> 00:05:05,779
game devs? These might be game devs. The suit, Tiger Swallow, Big Lion, Green Chick, Big Pimp,

38
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:19,750
Big Pimpin', Big Pimpin' Eddie. Well, I want to make a, I want to make one. All right,

39
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:30,709
head information, name, custom skater, age 16. I had sucks to do this. You know what I mean?

40
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:36,149
I remember playing games when it was on Xbox or PlayStation. It was like, yeah, all right.

41
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:48,230
I'm done. All right. That hurts. Stance. I would pick Goofy, but Goofy just means left,

42
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:56,839
lefty, right? I'm just going to regular. Push. Never Mongo. Mongo Switch. Always Mongo.

43
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:09,980
I don't know what these mean. What's just default? Never Mongo. Do not push. Always Mongo. Always

44
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:19,399
Mongo. Full Mongo. What does that mean though? What is always Mongo? What is Mongo? I don't know

45
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:26,199
what Mongo is. Tricks. Street. I like going up high, but I also like manual too. So we're going

46
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:40,009
to street. I gotta, I gotta Google what this is. What is Mongo? What is Mongo? Mongo skateboarding.

47
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,449
The Mongo push. A stupid way to skateboard. A person skates Mongo if they use their leading foot

48
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,170
in the front while riding to push. While they are pushing, the back foot stays near the rear

49
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,860
of the board and they push with their front foot. So Mongo is a stupid way to skateboard. This is

50
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:10,220
the official definition. Is it bad to ride Mongo on a skateboard? It's a bad habit. Okay. Never Mongo.

51
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:23,240
Goofy. Always Mongo. Okay. Never Mongo. Regular Stance. Hometown. What the fuck? Las Vegas.

52
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:38,120
Uh, yeah. I wasn't born in Las Vegas. You're right. Fuck. I was. All right. How do I do shit?

53
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:49,819
Shit. Boston. Do I have to do Boston mass? No. Where did you know where that is? Custom name.

54
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,819
Me? No, it's going to have to be like some fucked up like frog person.

55
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:29,829
Ernie. I think I like Ernie. Ernie is a Mongo name. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. It's

56
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:39,000
Bernie. It's Ernie. All right. Ernie. I don't have a last name. I'm just Ernie. No, I'm just Ernie.

57
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All right. Well, Ernie isn't 34. That's not even me. So I can change these. Whatever. 40 from Boston.

58
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:18,809
Ernie. Head options. Face. Can I rotate? Okay. Can I? Whoa. Gray. Gray skin. Gray. Eyes. All right.

59
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,409
I can't do eyes. That's going to fuck me up. Yeah. That's the... What was that game that Ubisoft came

60
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:33,940
out with? That was a fucking mess. It was like a... What was it? It was a... What's it called?

61
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,080
Assassin's Creed Unity. Yes. That's the one. This is every YouTuber's thumbnail for an Assassin's

62
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:55,539
Creed Unity video. I mean, I would have done it. I think I like a gray skin. Let's see what else

63
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:04,730
we can do. Hold on. Wait. Oh, that doesn't... I can just be blue.

64
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:17,960
Okay. What is Ernie? I think... I don't know if I want to just be like a wacky color or something.

65
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:30,789
You know what I mean? No. I don't want to be like orange or like blue. I don't want to be like

66
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:42,279
lime green. Let's take this set to a value. I can be like a glow stick.

67
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:58,759
All right. How about... Should I be a glow stick? I don't know. Let's force a neighbor. All right.

68
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,480
Fine. I'll be a glow stick. I'm going to... No, no, no. I'm going to get... I'm going to hate that

69
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,960
after like fucking three hours. All right. How about kind of glow stick? Like how about just sick?

70
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Like how about just sick?

71
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,649
Just look back here.

72
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:32,009
It's my hair. Middle part. No, no, no.

73
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:43,029
Comb over. No, this is all too easy. It has to... It's too easy.

74
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Medium, medium. Actually, I kind of like this one.

75
00:11:53,110 --> 00:12:04,230
Spike long. No, no. I kind of like clown hair. No, I don't. Literally spikes is what I thought

76
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:13,049
that said. Pompadour. I like it. Eraser hair. I think I like the pompadour.

77
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:23,460
How do I do a hair color? Make it the same color as my skin.

78
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:34,309
I'm not sure I can even replicate it again.

79
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,019
Shrek 5. Zoomer Shrek.

80
00:12:49,659 --> 00:13:06,860
No, I don't want it. I don't like this. How about... All right. Let's do middle part.

81
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,129
That's fine. I don't care. Whatever.

82
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:44,440
It's just my hair. Facial hair. Beard. Mustache. Long sideburns. Honest Abe.

83
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,529
Did it be honest Abe?

84
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:04,649
Just looks like he has a helmet on. Chinless Abe. Okay. Just looks like he has a weird helmet on.

85
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:17,580
It's going to be lower saturation.

86
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:38,759
It's just wearing a scarf with your own hair. Is this a... Okay. Is this a hairstyle?

87
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,460
Having your hair go all the way down to the bottom and come all the way to the right?

88
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,620
Is this like the wearing a helmet of your own hair style?

89
00:14:51,019 --> 00:15:11,500
Can't get the color exact. That's close. That's good. That's good. That's all right. That looks

90
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:38,059
good. That looks fine. Hats. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I already have a helmet on.

91
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:53,190
No. No. No. No. How about the dunce? Okay. I like that one. I like the dunce hat. I get to be the

92
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:01,029
guy that wears the dunce hat today. Hold on. Let's see the others. Viking helmet. British officer.

93
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:10,149
A British bobby. Oh, I kind of like this too. That's so stupid.

94
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:22,019
If I could wear a wizard hat. But if I do a wizard hat, then I have to be a wizard.

95
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,460
What about the earmuffs? Just be a wizard. But I have to do like a big long wizard beard. No,

96
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:44,980
I don't want to do that. It's too... I'm going dunce. Can you even make a long beard?

97
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:59,480
Can you even make a long beard? Let's see.

98
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,079
Facial hair. Let's go. Beard. No, you can't.

99
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,200
It's just painted on. Guys, this game came out in like 2004. 2003.

100
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:24,519
No. We're going to have to go dunce.

101
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:47,240
Or actually, I like the earmuffs. The earmuffs to me are funnier. I'm going earmuffs. Wait, paper bag.

102
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:13,000
But no, no, that sucked. That's just the eyes with more space. Dastardly Richard.

103
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,579
I might be able to make it pretty close.

104
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:34,779
See if I can. Damn it. I can't put glasses on the front.

105
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:47,619
Okay, we got shirt style. It could be pretty close.

106
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:10,859
There you go. You're going to think it's blue.

107
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:18,700
You sure it's not? No, it's blue.

108
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,730
Make it darker.

109
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:44,519
Make it a little too dark. Yeah, it's all right, though. It ended up being perfect.

110
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,079
It's a zipper hoodie, you fake fan. I can't. Well, you want me to go through every offer to

111
00:19:53,079 --> 00:20:05,819
find the zipper hoodie? And that's not even true. Dick Dastardly Richard. That's not a zipper hoodie.

112
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:23,880
It's not a hoodie. Who's the fake fan? It's this, but long sleeve because there are no zippers.

113
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:42,619
It's not a hoodie. It's just a jacket. This is actually, it's probably pretty damn close.

114
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:56,710
Let's see. Suit coat? No. All right. Remember jogger jacket? I think jogger jacket's the one.

115
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:18,650
It's got to make it weird and light blue and splotchy. I mean, the reason why that shirt looks so

116
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:29,430
different and odd is because it's a game from 1995. I can't add a Nintendo 64 pixels.

117
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:41,829
It's a little lighter than that. It's like this. That's close. This is close enough.

118
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:46,940
All right. Now the second color. Oh, I can't even make it the second color. It's all right.

119
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:57,059
Close enough. What about gloves? Spike neck? Wristband? What do you gloves?

120
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:12,220
Wrist tape? Elbow band? No. Gloves. Here we go. Gloves. Can't wear gloves.

121
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:23,930
Does it go some green or something? I can't believe this is actually kind of working.

122
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:31,769
All right. These are, they're white, but they're pixelated and crappy and smudged with

123
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:40,140
42 kilobyte, like yellow and brown pixels. So we're going to go zebra like it is in the video.

124
00:22:40,859 --> 00:23:05,339
I can't make these longer. Hmm. Suit pants. Jogger. Oh, he's just going to be in a jogging suit.

125
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:30,220
Oh, he's in white. He's got a stripe going down in his boots. He's got these red

126
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:40,890
bare feet. Oh, it's too bad. I can't make him in bare feet. If I make these red, it'll be fine.

127
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:58,339
Anything chunkier than this? He's a chunky. Well, then this guy's not Ernie anymore.

128
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:07,670
This is not Ernie. This is Dick Dastardly Richard.

129
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:24,569
All right. These are boots. There we go. What happened to Ernie? Like that's, I want Ernie.

130
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:44,809
Fuck Ernie. Head top. Wait, you can. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can't see any of this.

131
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:55,480
Wait, you can. What? Nope. No, the fucking head's coming off. That's coming off. Ernie can be a big

132
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,220
fan of Dick Dastardly Richard. This is coming off. He's just, he just dresses as him because he

133
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:28,940
likes that video. No, if you tell me I have full on scale, face scaling options. What? How big?

134
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:36,980
I don't want to be too huge. No, this is not, this is not Dick Dastardly Richard's origin story.

135
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:53,670
This is Ernie the fan. He can make a mega mine. Head top. Where's this going? Oh, okay. Let's do

136
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:06,950
it this way. At least don't make him green. We'll fix it. Hold on. Yeah, this, this is big fan Ernie.

137
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:32,700
Big fan Ernie. That's what his name is changing to. Super wide. Big head funny. His head's not that

138
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:58,460
big. His head's not even that big. But it is funny though. Why is it? His head's not even that big.

139
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:32,809
Y'all. All right, that's too extreme though. That's way too extreme. Yeah, I don't want him to have

140
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:58,099
like an orc mouth. How about, all right, that's okay. Chest. Oh, shit. Make him, make him like

141
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:27,430
an ant. All right, I like this. This big gross stomach. A tiny, tiny chest. Wink. Hold on. Big

142
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:39,160
biceps. Forearms. Yeah, I don't, I gotta take the beard off too. It just looks stupid.

143
00:28:42,039 --> 00:29:08,150
Huge hands. Or small hands. We gotta make him kind of like a pear. All right. Why's the jaw look

144
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:33,369
still so strange? Without the facial hair. Okay, I think it's good. I think it's good.

145
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:58,619
Big fan Ernie, I think is good. He's an alien. All right, we got it. We're done. Scale options.

146
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:11,420
Body. That's good. You can just make him roll. Okay. I'm doing any of this stuff. Who cares?

147
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:23,269
Wait, does it matter? Helmet. No, who cares? Does big fan Ernie need to be protected?

148
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:34,539
All right. Big fan Ernie can wear knee pads. These look like metal shackles.

149
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:51,640
Not knee pads. How big are the elbow pads? I can't even wear elbow pads. He has cow legs.

150
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:13,670
I'm gonna be so safe. Okay, that's fine. I'm done. I can't unseat the cow.

151
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,910
I cannot unseat the cow legs now that you said that.

152
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:38,279
Information. Big fan Ernie. Well, how about bovine Ernie? That's not bad either.

153
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:55,509
I think I'm gonna go with, I'm going with bovine Ernie. Can't wait for this guy to get instantly

154
00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:08,569
eliminated in the next rumble. He's gonna have zero stats. Bovine Ernie. I think he's

155
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,130
however late on the screen. All right. Bovine Ernie. There he is.

156
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:20,009
From whatever. He could be like my neighbor or something. I don't care. How high can this go?

157
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:32,819
45. Okay. Done. Okay. Save skater. Let's see those legs.

158
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,259
Bovine Ernie. All right. Here we go. Let's start a career.

159
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:59,670
He saved. Should have been Dick Dastardly Richard. Well, it's, it's bovine Ernie.

160
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:08,680
New story. Begin at normal. I'm not doing 2003 hard. No, I'm doing normal.

161
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:19,299
2003 hard is 2020 like insane impossible. Let's go.

162
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,309
Muska is actually coming to this dump for a skate demo. Get dressed. Let's go.

163
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:46,730
I am dressed. I'm already dressed in my shackles.

164
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,650
Oh, I just got my ride all set up. What? They talk sort of looks like that thing's held together

165
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:10,099
with duct tape. Let's go skate. I didn't know they actually spoke. He's fully voice acted.

166
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:17,860
Home sweet home. What a dump. At least it has some killer spots. The old pool down by the high school

167
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:24,099
scab land, the drainage ditch on the south side of town street, our own little strip of paradise

168
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:31,289
complete with drug dealers who hate skateboarders. Well, I got to turn the volume up now.

169
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:36,809
Get ready. Check this out. Oh, by the way. Yeah. Again, this whole thing's going to get muted just

170
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:45,300
in case you didn't know. It's definitely been looked at bad on Xbox 360. All right, let's talk.

171
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:55,500
What up, Eric? Hey, help me out here. I need help with. I was just skating mind in my own

172
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,420
and the dealers grabbed my board. They tore it apart and they threw the pieces up on the roof.

173
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,219
My knees wrecked. Could you grab them for me? I got to go. I got to get on the roof.

174
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:14,059
Oh, man. Yeah, I'll hold your death. Use A to jump and R to grab onto stuff and then pull yourself

175
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:20,380
up. Press A to continue. So you jump, but you hold it. R is grab on stuff. I'm actually walking

176
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:28,940
around. I forget everything about this game. The next part should be on the house across the alley.

177
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:47,139
Jump. We can grab the gutter piece. Okay. Last part is on top of your house.

178
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,940
Hey, well, I'm getting my right set up again. Let's see if you are a couple of things.

179
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,079
You can get off the board to get over terrain that would normally be hard or impossible to

180
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,840
skate over. So you can get off the board. Is it L? Give this a try. Get off your board,

181
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:15,860
then jump over the barriers. What button is that? What? What is that like weird moon or like cute?

182
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:29,559
What is that? What button is that? Is it LBs? Okay. Run and jump over each barrier to get on.

183
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:38,789
Okay. So that's left bumper. Good job. Now jump up while running and then grind on the barrier.

184
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:55,130
Jump and wait. There it is. Okay. Beating stat challenges will increase your skating abilities.

185
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,250
Pause the game and go to the view stats menu to see a list of the challenges.

186
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:18,309
I think I got those knee pads on. Wait, what's that? Oh, this is like, this is shit to do

187
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:24,389
everywhere. What's this one? What are you doing? You psyched to see Muska's demo? Yeah. Bet you

188
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:32,760
are. Hey, since you punks aren't in school, why don't you go put up some flyers? Oh, I got to

189
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:41,260
put flyers up. Try to hit all the telephone poles. Why does that name sound fake in 2020?

190
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:58,659
You know what I mean? Like Chad Muska. The audio is delayed. Shouldn't be. Is it delayed?

191
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:15,659
So what you're hearing the sound after I move. Well, it should be going click, click, click,

192
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:33,179
click, click. It's not. It's barely fine. It's good. It's a little delayed. The video is slow.

193
00:38:33,900 --> 00:39:04,389
I don't know why that is. Let me try one thing. How does this change it? Yeah, just that delayed

194
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:08,070
the audio for like a hundred milliseconds. All right, let's do it. So pick up the flyers.

195
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:15,480
All right, I got to get back into the Tony Hawk spirit here.

196
00:39:34,420 --> 00:40:00,969
Oh shit. Did I win? I think I won. Yeah, I'm good. I love springing together. Oh, I missed it. I

197
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:14,920
missed it. Ah, good. Get you done prancing on and off your board. Let's actually escape.

198
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:25,610
At least I'm not too gimp to prance. How's your knee? I'll show you. So you land this.

199
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:45,639
Do a melon in the drainage dish. Oh, that was fucking pathetic. Oh, there's blood.

200
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:48,519
There's blood. Do a melon. I didn't. But did I not do a melon?

201
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:58,920
I flexed way too hard. I flexed too hard. Did I not do a melon?

202
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:28,280
A melon then revert to R as you land. Yeah, revert.

203
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:34,420
That's it. Enough warming up. You can't beat my score and you know it. What's right?

204
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,300
You see people at the skate park or like the ice skating rinks and anywhere that there's a

205
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,340
skill like the white, the ground is made out of moving material. What's going on?

206
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:48,659
What's your score? Beat Eric's score. We'll give him a head start.

207
00:41:50,469 --> 00:42:00,550
Ooh, a thousand points. What else can you do? Wow. Really nice, man. Oh, I can't keep,

208
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:27,769
I can't like leave the area. I'll beat him. Don't worry. I'm trying so hard.

209
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:44,869
I'm still in the lead. All right. I'm just going to play. Oh shit. Eric's going to win.

210
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:20,869
Let's go. I gave him a head start. That was stupid. That's enough warming up. All right.

211
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:50,360
Let's go. Oh, why? Why is he fucking kicking my ass?

212
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:14,679
What? Why is he doing so much better this time? And you guys wanted me to do this on sick. No

213
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:30,760
fucking way. Losing to Eric. Wait a second. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

214
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:45,019
wait. I don't have stat points that I didn't put in. Do lip tricks. It's like holding triangle,

215
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:52,809
right? Right at the top. All right, Eric, let's fucking go.

216
00:44:56,889 --> 00:45:55,079
Okay, come on. What? Whoa. He just fucking shot me into the air. Oh my God. I'm like

217
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:24,840
tilting right now. Did I win? Eric, don't you fucking dare. Eric, Eric, why are you so hard?

218
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:35,420
What the fuck, Eric? Eric, you're supposed to be in the tutorial. Eric, you haven't even taught me

219
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:48,900
how to do anything besides a melon grab. Why are you trying so hard? Imagine doing this on sick

220
00:46:48,900 --> 00:47:11,159
difficulty. He probably does like 100,000 points. Fuck, I keep screwing that up. You can't just

221
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:28,539
mash. Shit. Oh my God. I'm not going to be able to beat Eric. I'm not going to be able to beat

222
00:47:28,539 --> 00:48:01,849
Eric on the tutorial. I beat Eric. I can't believe I almost lost it. That was way harder than it

223
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:21,539
should have been. I can't believe it took that long to beat Eric. Did he get arrested?

224
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:43,659
Fuck. I was going to say you fucking try to do that line, Eric. Also, I have to keep in mind,

225
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:59,849
I'm at zero stats on everything. I think I'm supposed to know who this is. Mike V.

226
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:25,800
You're way nicer than fucking Eric was. You all right, kid? You seem to smash your face on the

227
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:32,980
fucking ground. All right. You know what? Can you use an Xbox one controller on 360?

228
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:48,840
Can you use an Xbox one controller on 360? God damn it. You can't. It's the Xbox controller.

229
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,039
They're all the same button. They're not individual buttons.

230
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:01,900
I probably should have thought about that. It's all just one axis. It's just one huge

231
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,460
button on their original Xbox 360 controller. You know, they're individual. God damn it.

232
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:18,539
See how these are individual buttons? See, like, you guys need to see. I can't use the analog

233
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:25,400
either. It's too hard. I'll have to. I'll get used to it. I never use the analog in any of these

234
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:43,059
games. How do I do Flamingo? Left, right, B. What? You're fucked for real. I've never used

235
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:50,039
an analog in a Tony Hawk game. I only use the defense. It's easier to press the buttons

236
00:50:50,760 --> 00:51:06,570
because, like, hitting, like, left and it's... No, it's too hard. I'd rather just use the analog.

237
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:14,619
It's because of manuals. It's hard for me to do a manual than analog. I don't like it.

238
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:25,989
It's easier to go, like, tap up and down on the actual buttons than to have the analog.

239
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:33,510
That's why I learned how to play these games with the D-Pad long ago, just because manuals

240
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,909
is just so much easier. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Because you can go way

241
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:53,179
too far. See how I'm using the analog right now? Oh, too much. Remember, you're nuts. I saw one person

242
00:51:53,179 --> 00:52:13,099
said, I agree, so I don't care. As long as one person agrees with me, what do I care? All right,

243
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:33,269
we need another... Oh, I got too greedy. Looking for... There is somebody.

244
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:40,150
Oh, I never even got the guy's skateboard back, did I? Hey, JT, not out racing today.

245
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,559
Hey, the kid next door. Nah, Charles needs some exercise.

246
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,000
I'll give you five bucks to run him around the block a couple of times for me.

247
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,380
Five bucks? Wait, what?

248
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:20,019
Do I have to ride the dog? This dog is fucking fast, man.

249
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:50,940
Oh, Muska's here. We got Muska's demo. Same counter. All right, so how is the voice acting

250
00:53:50,940 --> 00:54:18,010
in this game, you think? Yo, check this out. Muska, chilling, chilling. Where? Australia.

251
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,449
That's how you hook it up. How do we get this close to Chad Muska?

252
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,639
Wow, Muska in Jersey? Unreal. I wonder if anyone could impress him.

253
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:46,730
He's checking out the pool by the skate shop. Eric, where is that?

254
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:59,500
Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad, are you looking? Chad, I just want to say I'm a really big fan.

255
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:09,190
What do you think about this? Chad, look at me, Chad.

256
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,340
Chad, just wait, I'm coming. Chad, take a look at this one.

257
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:39,690
Oh, hey, Chad. Hey, man. When we drive around, just avoid this fucking weird kid.

258
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:42,889
He's freaking me out. It looks like a good place to skate.

259
00:55:42,889 --> 00:56:04,659
I didn't do it. All right. 30,000 points. Fuck. 40 year old kid. Come on. I can't.

260
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:14,389
Do you think we should call the police or something? Or is it going to be all right?

261
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:53,219
It doesn't look like the other kids. Chad, just watch. Okay, I know what I have to do.

262
00:56:53,219 --> 00:57:10,599
Yo, it looks like a good place to skate. Oh, they turn this way. Fuck. 7,000. God damn it.

263
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,699
Yo, it looks like a good place to skate. What's this? I'm just going to finish the trick in

264
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:57,929
front of me. What? When did it finish? A place to skate. I'm so desperate for his attention.

265
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:08,360
Just give me attention, Chad. I'm dying over here. Just please look at me.

266
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:17,960
I'm going to go. I'm going to start all the way back here. I know he can't see me. It doesn't

267
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:33,659
matter. I'm going to finish the trick. Here we go. I made a good line. 6,000 points. Fuck.

268
00:58:41,719 --> 00:59:06,679
Use the half pipe. 30k total. It's 30k total. Not 30k in one trick. You can bust some nice lines

269
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:28,599
there. Is it? Yes. Restart it. That looks like a good place to skate. Okay, fine. It does. Nice

270
00:59:28,599 --> 01:00:13,800
turn. Okay, he saw it. Okay, good. He's not even looking. I just was in front of the car.

271
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:26,789
I was just standing in front of the car. Not bad. Not bad. That looks like a good place to skate.

272
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:48,260
Yes, it does, Chad. I'm losing my mind here. That was 10,000 points. That looks like a good

273
01:00:48,260 --> 01:01:17,719
place to skate, man. Okay, I'm laughing. This is too funny. Whoa, Chad Muska. Holy shit.

274
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,320
I can't believe he noticed me.

275
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:31,320
I had no money, no place to stay, nothing, man, until my first shop sponsor hooked me up.

276
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,280
So why don't you head down to your shop, check out their riders. I thought there was a Christmas

277
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:40,360
present in his front seat. I was like, wow. And yo, Merry Christmas. It is. Thank you. Thanks.

278
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,480
Mr. Peralta's not here right now, but if you want to be sponsored by a skate shop,

279
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,440
you'll need to impress the riders on his team. If you get us to sign off on you, you're in.

280
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:08,119
Okay. All right. Bernie Ovine is doing pretty good. Chapter two, impressing the locals.

281
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:18,019
So you want to be sponsored, huh? Got to be able to put up big numbers under pressure.

282
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:27,349
Think you can handle it? Yeah, sure. No problem. Okay, then let's see what you can do using our

283
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:30,710
setup.

284
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:46,969
Why don't I have a private lane? Why don't I have a private lane? Why are you people standing here?

285
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:54,679
I'm taking out all the competition. Oh, okay. I need 20,000 points. Everyone's watching you.

286
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,000
Let me see. I saw the fucked up thing I just did.

287
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:16,699
All right. Did it. Jesus. Yep. I am a local. Dude, I go to school with your sister.

288
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:26,039
Then you should get stats increased. No, you'll probably need at least five tries to hit them

289
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:49,699
like I do. You Chris's best line. It took me six months to hit that line. Well, whatever.

290
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:55,050
I did it. See if you can hit this. Chris's crazy line.

291
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:29,750
It's a broken neck in two places. End it, end it, end it, end it. All right, let's go.

292
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:35,639
I got to impress all the locals. Why does it have a gas coming out of here?

293
01:04:36,360 --> 01:05:00,119
I heard yo skater. Why am I a charging bull? How much do I weigh? Am I a train?

294
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:07,059
You goals. Impress Sean. Impress Joey. Impress Sean.

295
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:11,449
Let's see if you got the cojones. I can just go right to them.

296
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:16,650
Meet me on the roof. Use the quarter pipe to get up to roof height. Then hold left and jump off

297
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:21,929
your board onto the roof. That seems like a lot of it. Jump onto the roof and then get off your

298
01:05:21,929 --> 01:05:31,880
board while jumping up onto the roof. Nicely done. Now I want you to transfer between the houses.

299
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,679
Don't live in these houses to transfer. Come down the ramp and angle yourself. So your jump

300
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:44,780
carries you across the space between the houses. Oh, and carefully you don't overshoot. I don't

301
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:49,500
want to have to scrape you off of Elm Street. Transfer over the alley. So he wants me to

302
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:11,610
feel pain. Hold on. I kind of don't understand what he wants me to do. Transfer over, get off

303
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:26,789
the board and then jump up and then get on. Oh, I know what he wants me to do. Nice. Now spine

304
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:33,210
back down and I'll tell Mr. Brompton you've got skills. So skate up the quarter pipe, catch air,

305
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:38,889
spine transfer and land in the quarter pipe below. Skate up the quarter pipe, catch air, spine

306
01:06:38,889 --> 01:07:03,980
transfer and land in the quarter pipe. Spine transfer. That's not it. Where does it go?

307
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:18,090
Why is it spawning me here? I don't know. What is it? What spine? Okay, spine transfer is that.

308
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:28,070
Spine transfer is you just go forward. They're using these terms like I should know where they

309
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:32,980
are. Mongo, spine transfer, goofy. I don't know what these things are.

310
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,980
So just run in. I weigh like 6,000 pounds. Just run everybody over.

311
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:13,780
Where's the school? Like where's the school? What is going on in this neighborhood?

312
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:25,939
We have to like fight crack heads. Wait kid, it's too dangerous.

313
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:56,180
It's an actual stealth section. Wait kid, it's too dangerous.

314
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:56,140
Oh, get on the roof. What? I'm supposed to get by them around this way. Where is it?

315
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:22,710
Is that the Simpsons? Wait kid, it's too dangerous. I'm going to go back. No,

316
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:32,329
no. Use the wires? What do you mean the wires? What? You want me to tightrope walk on the wire?

317
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:45,220
I can't grab them. Power lines? Didn't I just grab them and fall? Just go straight on the roof.

318
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:17,479
Wait, why would I do this? This would kill somebody. You die if you do this. If I make

319
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:46,100
any connection with anything. I can get fucking hurt doing this. All lines can't kill you,

320
01:11:46,100 --> 01:12:05,210
but electric lines can. If you touch any other thing, you die. Wait, Eric? Is Eric doing drugs?

321
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:10,649
Oh no, Eric is doing arson.

322
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:24,939
Oh, I'm looking for the owner, Mr. Peralta. Wait, are you the Stacy Peralta? That's me.

323
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:31,020
You the guy my skaters have been talking about? Well, I hope so. I'd like to be sponsored by your

324
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:37,739
shop. Yeah, so would everybody else. I'll tell you what. Make me a sponsor me video. Show me what

325
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,340
makes you different than Bobby B down the street. I can't wait to make a sponsor me video. Please

326
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:44,779
don't hand me anything from the same old spots in New Jersey, dude, because I've seen it all.

327
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:54,409
Done. No local spots and different tricks. Dude, I just gave me the go ahead and do something

328
01:12:54,409 --> 01:13:01,300
dangerous. They know those gangsters know it was me. What are you talking about? When I got back

329
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:06,420
to my house last night, they were parked outside waiting for me. I've seen all the local tricks.

330
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:12,979
I haven't seen somebody put their tongue in through an outlet yet. It couldn't work for me.

331
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:32,840
Hey, Eric, are you okay? I think we lost him. Who's this guy?

332
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:38,890
We got to get out of here. If they find me, it'll be my name on this headstone.

333
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:45,060
I'm hiding here with Headstone Harry. Headstone Harry. But if we bring in some scrap metal,

334
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:49,300
he says he'll bang us out of our ramp. And if we can get it set up, the street warriors say they'll

335
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:55,939
give us a tow to get speed. Jumping the bridge is the only way to get past the cops. Quick,

336
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,739
drug dealers are after us. All right, I got to get the scrap metal. Press A and jump and grab.

337
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:13,050
All right, scrap metal, let's go. Or scrap, scrap, scrap. Let's probably get off the board.

338
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:41,159
Jump and grab. Where am I? Up here? On the roof? Do I need six? Filter. Big jump.

339
01:14:45,930 --> 01:15:00,199
Didn't work, but it's all right. Need to get to the other side of the bridge, huh?

340
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:05,319
No problem. Those pigs can't stop us. Grab the back of my ride and I'll get you up to speed.

341
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:15,779
Clear the bridge. Okay, let's go. Don't let go until I tell you. Hit L and R if you want to

342
01:15:15,779 --> 01:16:08,819
switch sides. I don't need to switch sides. Ready? Steady? All right, how do you let go?

343
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:24,630
Is it just up again? Is it down? All right, it's down. Holy shit.

344
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:42,020
No skater punks allowed in this station.

345
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,159
How would I land that? Do I have a parachute?

346
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,680
Please, man, we have to get out of town. The Elm Street dealers are after us. We're desperate.

347
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:00,739
Didn't you see us jump the bridge? Guess I was too busy stopping lions,

348
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:06,260
skate rats from sneaking into the station and spray painting, I am the king of no pants on

349
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:12,920
a phone key on. What's your problem, bacon bits? Wake up on the wrong side of your mother this

350
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:38,100
morning. Oh, holy shit. Makes Stu chase you three times around the circle. Did I kill him?

351
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:54,340
Okay, well, we killed the security guard. Yes. Keep going.

352
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:14,659
All right. Can't be on the street. Get 25,000 points. Don't touch the street.

353
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:42,380
End it. Oh, I thought I could end it. End it. Oh, it's ended. End the trick.

354
01:18:43,100 --> 01:19:23,640
I can end it right there. There it is. No, it's not it. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Shit.

355
01:19:26,789 --> 01:19:42,409
No, you idiot. I was trying to do a lit trick. Turn the music up. The music is as loud as it can go.

356
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:52,310
I think it's just bad mixing. Back to the hangout. Save. Wait, they took Eric. Hold on.

357
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:57,300
Yeah, look, I think I'm pretty sure it's off as loud as it can go. Maybe it's not.

358
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:00,739
I had it in reverse.

359
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:20,420
All right, we got to chase him. Hey, Eric, look out the back window.

360
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:55,500
Eric's dead. Can I go faster? Oh, come on. What the fuck is that even there for?

361
01:20:55,819 --> 01:21:20,979
Who are these people?

362
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:45,500
There's a car in this game. Okay, well, that took me back a little. There's a car. Good.

363
01:21:50,420 --> 01:22:09,850
It's a full letter grade. That much is certain. All right, Brian. Imagine you jumping for him.

364
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:16,310
That was a stupid thing. It was like a Disney game. Rescue Eric. Got it.

365
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:23,529
That's one way to rescue somebody. Let's get the hell out of here.

366
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:43,189
Quick, get on the train. That's Mario Kart. We can't grind in Mario Kart. We're in Manhattan.

367
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:55,829
Big bad New York. Peralta will be pumped if we can get some footage from the program.

368
01:22:55,829 --> 01:23:02,630
Are we actually going to make a video? Veterans Memorial, the Pyramid Ledges, and 78 Water Street.

369
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:04,949
I hope I get to edit the video.

370
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:18,100
Where are your parents? Well, in the lore, I am the parent. This character is 40, so

371
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:31,300
you're looking at him. Skate the Big Apple. I'll find it.

372
01:23:50,779 --> 01:23:56,060
Explode the Alpha and Omega Coles with drum rolls and hoes. So we uphold and foretold the scores

373
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:01,500
of six years ago. Fast flow from G-Rap to Kool Moe. Super Celeb-O. Major to the Minimo. Every

374
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,899
individual bounce to the tip of your lungs. Collapse and raps you trapped in. The only way

375
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:09,659
to make it happen, George, I've been fast. I'm the hot dog. The run the hottest monologue

376
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:17,819
installed. Poetic and certain. Can I actually get up there from? Oh, wait. Get on the board.

377
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:38,489
Oh, OK. I restarted. I got one.

378
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:50,569
Found one of five. Where's your other stuff? Oh, is that what? Up there? Shit.

379
01:24:56,649 --> 01:24:57,930
Come on. Why'd you have to do that?

380
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:07,770
No, I got the one up there.

381
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:28,470
I don't see anything. Oh, there's one here.

382
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:32,069
I'm going to get the hair on that.

383
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:56,409
Where? Over there. Where? Where? Where? Right there.

384
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:17,689
I'm going to get one of there, too. OK, I should get it. Wrong way.

385
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:29,289
Last one's this way.

386
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:45,939
I got to get all the way up there. OK, I know two. I got to grind on that bar.

387
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:58,260
How many cars to come down this tiny little fucking road?

388
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:07,029
They're probably saying the same thing about me, too.

389
01:27:24,649 --> 01:27:33,270
Oh, I had it. I just didn't grab it. No, I had it too. Shit. No, I'm dead.

390
01:27:39,180 --> 01:28:02,869
No, here we go. Number two. Here we go. All right. I'm hitting. I'm letting go of the ollie

391
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:26,890
too. Way too late, apparently. I don't know why. Song name? Pause for the song name. Hold on.

392
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:59,159
Little Lips. Grab it, can I? Can I just jump and grab the damn thing? Do this. Can I get it?

393
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:36,260
Yeah. Song is Crush Them by GBH. Crush Them. Get off the board. This one's going to be so hard for

394
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:53,500
me to get because of the angle. Tiny little lips. No, I want to grind it. No, I want to stop doing it.

395
01:29:53,500 --> 01:30:20,090
I want to grind the fucking rail. Thank you. There it is. Yes. All right, who's next?

396
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:42,659
You. No, you. What song is this? It's Braggin' Rites.

397
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:22,460
Uh, hold grind combos. Up and Y and then Y. Y and then down Y.

398
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:33,340
Can you make the game louder? A smidge. There we go. What about you? Yo, let's see you try

399
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:38,060
this one. Get special on this QP to do a Muwop 5-0. It's QP. I don't know what that term is.

400
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:50,180
Get a QP on this M5-0. Oh wait, that's Chad Muska. He's just hanging out over here.

401
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:55,689
All right. Get special on this quarter pipe then do a Moonwalk 5-0.

402
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:10,069
I'm gonna die. Get special and Moonwalk 5-0 the waterfront.

403
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:29,989
Down, left, right. I died.

404
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:39,979
Still don't have a special.

405
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,180
All right, there we go.

406
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:55,510
Shit. Is that not it? I don't have a special anymore. Damn it.

407
01:32:55,510 --> 01:34:04,340
I didn't do it. Is this it? No, it's down, left, Y. Down, left, Y. All right, slow down a little.

408
01:34:04,899 --> 01:34:29,020
Down, left. Okay, here we go. Down, left, Y.

409
01:34:29,739 --> 01:34:41,060
Don't fall in. Oh no, that guy. That guy was doing the same quest.

410
01:34:55,430 --> 01:35:06,659
Oh, it's all right. I'll get it. That poor guy was doing the same thing.

411
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:13,460
We're all trying to impress the same guy. I'm not going fast enough. Look at how bad this is.

412
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,739
Hey, be careful, man. Watch out for the bodies in there.

413
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:33,420
People keep trying to impress me and they keep getting fucking killed in there. You keep killing

414
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:55,399
each other. Radical. That's not a bad deal, but I don't really want to do that.

415
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:06,220
Why destroy the competing car mission? Why is this car so low? I feel like it's not even a car.

416
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:30,220
This is freaking me out. I feel like the car's inside the ground. I didn't mean it. Okay,

417
01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:36,220
I'm not sure what we're going to be doing this time. I think we're going to have a good line

418
01:36:36,220 --> 01:37:04,170
here because there's seven of these. That restarted. I got time. I got time.

419
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:11,689
Ah, that arrow fucked my head. It's hit and run all over again. It's like the same driving

420
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:40,649
mechanics in hit and run. Where's the last one? I'm getting time. That's good. Wait, where is he?

421
01:37:50,340 --> 01:38:00,939
How do you even have to shop in an alley? That doesn't seem like the smartest place to get

422
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:05,479
business.

423
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:25,159
Okay, entertain us by throwing 45,000 anywhere or do I have to be in here? 45,000 doesn't matter.

424
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:35,449
I'm going to do this line here.

425
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:04,840
I just grew. It's got color. That's weird. All right, Bernie Bovine, doing good so far.

426
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:24,500
I can't wait to impress the fuck out of these guys.

427
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:31,220
Wait, take your soggy mob flips back to Jersey, tweakers. Hey, let's just go skate. If we tear

428
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:49,579
up your favorite spots- Excuse me, the proper term is crackhead. All right, I'm going to impress

429
01:39:49,579 --> 01:39:55,880
the locals and then they finally will have to use their video camera. Alley switch coming up.

430
01:40:03,979 --> 01:40:30,069
Trying to get up on the bridge. All right, what do you got for me? Some fun?

431
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:35,420
Can you help me out? I need to get some footage of this kid and my camera's busted.

432
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:39,100
He's risking his life on this line. Can you help me? I need to get some footage of this kid.

433
01:40:42,279 --> 01:41:18,260
Film the locals. Stay close. That works, but isn't somebody filming me filming him?

434
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:32,520
All right, I got to get a big drop into a switch with a transfer. Come on.

435
01:41:33,979 --> 01:41:37,819
Don't fall. Hold on. That's the best part of my 20-hundreds. I can do shit like this.

436
01:41:38,859 --> 01:41:44,539
You know exactly what I was trying to do there? Just pretend I did it.

437
01:41:45,500 --> 01:42:15,210
Oh, shit, dude. That was fucking awesome. All right, what do you got? Check out my buddy's

438
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:22,020
sick line here in the banks. This is a line? It's a bunch of cars. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

439
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:26,579
wait. Hit the killer line combo. Wait, why didn't it start? We're getting ready.

440
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:48,859
Oh, okay. Hold on. Start it up. What? That was- It was still in the combo.

441
01:42:49,739 --> 01:43:23,500
Fuck. I need more speed than this. Do I have to start on the car? I have to end on that.

442
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:19,479
I'm so mad. I can't fucking believe it. Dude, I'm telling you, this lift thing is

443
01:44:19,479 --> 01:44:27,779
fucking me so hard. It's just ruining me. It's fucking me up. Fucking me up. So bad.

444
01:44:28,579 --> 01:44:37,500
They're like, I'm timing it wrong. Help me out and help me get some killer footage for Stacy.

445
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:42,180
Remember how she was building this? Okay. The guards are tough, but I heard they like hot

446
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:49,770
steaming nuts. What? Get some nuts from the vendors and bring them back to the guards

447
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:55,210
before they get cold. Here comes the meltdown. No, I just- I gotta get that lift better

448
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:58,810
because I'm doing it too early or too late. It's like that little window.

449
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:04,500
All right, let's go. Getting nuts from- I get nuts for life. What? I don't understand.

450
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:20,729
Here. No, I have to keep getting them.

451
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:59,539
Hurry. Where's this guard? Guard up here? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

452
01:46:12,329 --> 01:46:33,289
There's a security guard this way. I have to put the angle up.

453
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:53,300
What's with this place and nuts? You guys have anything else to talk about here?

454
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:11,420
Yeah, we just fucking love nuts in New York. Get special and then nut bust inside the building.

455
01:47:13,609 --> 01:47:37,479
Wait. Okay, I got a special. Nut bust. Can I even get back in? Oh, it's in the building?

456
01:47:38,359 --> 01:48:04,100
Sure, you can make that trick even better. It's the rocket ship.

457
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:10,199
Create a trick. Welcome. In Tony Hawk Underground, you can create your own tricks.

458
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:14,119
The trick timeline shows the components of the trick you just landed.

459
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:25,909
Tweak it or make a whole new trick and map it to your skater. Let's go. Front flip spin.

460
01:48:25,909 --> 01:49:07,350
Okay. All right. Point five seconds seems pretty good. Okay. And then right after that,

461
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:33,619
I want a new trick. Slow, you go into this slow motion, more rotation. So just do like 6,000

462
01:49:33,619 --> 01:49:39,060
front flips in like three seconds. In two seconds. Yeah, hold on. Get rid of this.

463
01:49:39,939 --> 01:50:19,220
Uh, rotation. Roll. The spin. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. No, no, no. I want it to be.

464
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:46,020
Okay. One more. Two or three more of these. This is just a Sonic the Hedgehog card.

465
01:50:46,659 --> 01:51:03,739
Did you sound? Yeah.

466
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:24,340
No, I'm not doing the fart sound, guys.

467
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:13,260
Special. Okay. I can't even. What's happening in here?

468
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:21,109
This is what happens when you attach 10 thrusters to somebody in a Garry's Mod multiplayer game.

469
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:45,159
No, no, no, no, no. No, it's too much. Can't even see what's going on. No. How do I get back?

470
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:54,010
I don't delete it. I want another one of those super spins.

471
01:53:18,699 --> 01:53:28,649
Well, what's happening at the end? Wait, hold on. What about this?

472
01:53:29,609 --> 01:53:49,260
That's good. All right. That's good. Done. Is it saved? More sounds.

473
01:53:53,060 --> 01:54:20,680
I can only have three sounds. You get what you want. Okay. Trick done. Name the trick.

474
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:45,750
Preview trick. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I've accidentally done this so many times. I can't

475
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:58,090
put it on X. It's got to be way quicker than that. How long is it? Two seconds?

476
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:29,819
Let me see if I can even do this. I don't think it's possible to land. It's got to be faster.

477
01:55:29,819 --> 01:56:03,619
Holy shit, I just did it. Oh, no. This whole playthrough just got ruined. Rename it. Name

478
01:56:03,619 --> 01:56:22,890
trick. Hyper flush. Hyper drain. Hyper flush. The drain. The drain.

479
01:56:29,699 --> 01:56:41,670
Okay. This is on a kick flip. This replaced kick flip. The royal flush.

480
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:50,869
This whole playthrough just got destroyed because now I'm just going to make

481
01:56:50,869 --> 01:56:55,270
fucked up tricks for every move and never going to be able to finish the game.

482
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:18,119
The royal flush. Save the trick. Royal flush. Okay.

483
01:57:22,310 --> 01:58:00,310
It's got to be. Hold on. Back to editor. Okay. Let's try that. Use it.

484
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:20,380
Add a scream. There's no scream.

485
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:43,460
There is no scream, guys.

486
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:53,159
All right. We got it. Keep this. Create a trick. Once kept, a credit trick can be permanently

487
01:58:53,159 --> 01:59:05,020
mapped to your skater from the tricks menu. Yes. Okay. Let's create a new trick.

488
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:26,010
Holdable.

489
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:34,250
Air walk. Oh, that's pretty sick.

490
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:44,229
Hold on. What else we got? All right. We're going to do air walk.

491
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:53,989
Air walk is going to be long. We're just going to stick our legs out. Make it fall three seconds.

492
01:59:53,989 --> 02:00:03,239
Bang. Is it not holdable? No. So in the middle of this, boom. Right when the foot comes out,

493
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:14,789
you can do this. Flip trick. You don't have any room. What? Oh, can't do it for that long.

494
02:00:17,369 --> 02:00:23,859
All right. Right when the foot comes out, boom. Boom. New part. Gotta be quicker than that.

495
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:30,859
Bang. Foot comes out into a

496
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:48,039
boom. Hold on. Wait. Check this out.

497
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:07,800
Hold on. Oh, I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

498
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:13,449
No, never mind. Not a flip trick.

499
02:01:18,729 --> 02:01:21,449
Let's see. When there's a rotation, like spinning. Ooh, that's kind of cool.

500
02:01:22,489 --> 02:01:27,220
That's also pretty cool. That's pretty cool too.

501
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:38,390
Ooh, that's tricky.

502
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:52,659
No, no. I don't like it. Something else. Other. Well, hand stand.

503
02:01:54,500 --> 02:02:08,250
What is a Casper? Truck stand. The faction.

504
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:20,550
You just play the guitar.

505
02:02:45,050 --> 02:03:08,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

506
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:16,300
Another one. Oh, I can only have three sounds. All right. Let's check it out.

507
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:24,649
What? Why is it playing?

508
02:03:29,939 --> 02:03:35,689
It already has a sound effect built into it.

509
02:03:44,619 --> 02:03:48,710
It already has a sound effect. Get this fucking thing out of here.

510
02:03:48,710 --> 02:04:05,609
What is this? Hold the American flag. Slam bam. All right. This is a fall joke. I like this.

511
02:04:22,779 --> 02:04:35,060
It's got to be a little backwards. You're going to have backwards that you bounce off. No,

512
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:42,460
you're going to bounce back. Okay. It's too long. Three seconds is a long time.

513
02:04:42,699 --> 02:04:46,140
Anything more than two seconds is almost impossible without huge air.

514
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:58,140
Okay. One second should be all right. And then we'll go to other as well. What else we got?

515
02:05:02,859 --> 02:05:16,180
Handstand. Handstand and then falling off the board. Do it again, but backwards. Let's cheer.

516
02:05:17,699 --> 02:05:22,979
Anything ending in the fall. This is going to fuck me up because I'm going to think I fell off

517
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:54,489
the board. Slap. It's like I'm getting hit with projectiles. All right. Yeah. This is the people

518
02:05:54,489 --> 02:06:34,520
are throwing objects at me trick. You got it. How does it look? I like it. That's good. A little

519
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:47,109
bit shorter. Yeah. That's a wall. I've lost control. Yep. Right there. Yeah. Okay. So somebody

520
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:50,949
throws a rock at me. Hits me right in the chest. Bang. I'm losing control. Falling off the board.

521
02:06:53,609 --> 02:06:56,329
Yeah. I have to add like a, I have to add the moan because it's like,

522
02:06:58,970 --> 02:07:06,619
let me edit this. Hold on.

523
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:35,420
I actually kind of like it a little longer. It's got to, it's got to flow animation wise

524
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:55,029
a little bit longer. What does it actually end if you do it back here?

525
02:07:55,989 --> 02:07:58,279
Yeah. It's going to be the full fall.

526
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:07,909
Yeah. Cause then you get back up a little bit further out of the start,

527
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:18,010
a little bit further, I think. Let's see. Maybe further. No, I actually like it.

528
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:31,579
Like taking out his legs. Actually. Yeah. That's much better. Okay. Let's take a look at the slap.

529
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:41,859
What the fuck am I doing this like this? All right. That's fine.

530
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:51,539
We could pull. I like, I like how it rips his arm kind of back a little. There we go.

531
02:08:54,939 --> 02:09:02,869
Okay. Now we have to add, oh, okay. So that's bang right there.

532
02:09:03,909 --> 02:09:07,670
And then there has to, is it like a crashing sound?

533
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:34,180
Yeah. Okay. That actually, I don't think I want that there.

534
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:38,100
Do a fart at the land. You guys are killing me with the fart shit.

535
02:09:55,319 --> 02:09:57,479
Let's test it.

536
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:08,659
I don't think it's going to work out.

537
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:18,819
Oh, my knee. What?

538
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,479
No, that's too, I, this has to be way shorter than that.

539
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:42,760
No, no way. It's going to be way shorter.

540
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:49,260
Hey. Oh, it's cause it's too full seconds. That's way too long.

541
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,699
Now that's one and a half seconds.

542
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:27,020
Okay. That's right.

543
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:33,020
Okay.

544
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:52,729
Why is the sound not playing?

545
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:08,899
Just got him shorter. It's still too long. I think I have to remove the slap.

546
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:21,449
Make it a grind. Can I do that?

547
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:30,180
Rotation grab flip special. How do I do that? How do I, I can't make it a grind.

548
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:36,659
No, I can't. Oh, well. All right. Let's try that.

549
02:12:39,699 --> 02:13:02,649
Can I please get rid of the fart sound? Can I get rid of the fart? This is turning into

550
02:13:02,649 --> 02:13:31,979
another crack game. Okay. Let's go.

551
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:43,420
I'm ready. Edit tricks, edit tricks, grab tricks. So right and B is indie, sniffy right now.

552
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:59,270
We're going to make it a royal flush. Is it a grab trick? Is the, wait, is the royal flush

553
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:12,569
a grab trick or is it a kickflip? Wait, I need, I need to get rid of the, I need to get rid of

554
02:14:12,649 --> 02:14:21,510
Oh, I need to be, it has to be special. It doesn't matter. All right. Well then I'll,

555
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:32,340
I don't want it to be, I want indie. All right. What we got down at down, down B is going to be

556
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:40,699
the one, the royal flush. And then the other one's a kickflip. So it's a flip trick.

557
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:50,069
We'll just make that be left, left or whoops. Okay.

558
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:56,420
So now, are we just back out?

559
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,420
Let's see if I got it right.

560
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:07,460
I'm never going to be able to do that again.

561
02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:14,899
No way. In any in-game scenario.

562
02:15:23,539 --> 02:15:28,899
Music's so loud.

563
02:15:43,369 --> 02:15:44,569
All right. I'm ready to get back into the game.

564
02:15:53,220 --> 02:16:18,149
Working as intended. Let's view goals. What we got. Gap the burning taxi.

565
02:16:19,029 --> 02:16:28,420
I did it. So, wait, did I not do it? Check out that taxi. The fire's starting to rage.

566
02:16:42,229 --> 02:17:09,049
You got it. Don't show them that one. It's kind of hard to do this. Turn the fucking music up.

567
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:43,159
Louder, louder, louder. Hold on. Hold on. Just wait. No, the music is fine. Everyone,

568
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:52,250
look at all these people saying no. I can't do this nose grab. I'm doing up and B's.

569
02:17:52,969 --> 02:18:06,860
Why is it not? Well, this one's a, this is a goal. Restart it. Dude, one guy, one guy, one guy,

570
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:28,010
one guy. Dude, come on, dude. One guy, one guy. This song is so good. One guy. This song is so bad.

571
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:42,409
One guy. I think this song is just right. One guy. I can't, all right, I cannot make it across.

572
02:18:42,409 --> 02:18:46,409
I have to just go across and do the big one. It's too hard to jump it and do anything else.

573
02:18:47,049 --> 02:18:54,969
It's bad. There you go. I can't even do it. It's not possible. I don't have enough jump right now.

574
02:18:55,690 --> 02:19:15,399
I think this song is a cactus. One guy. But it's a pop puppet. Yeah.

575
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:34,229
What do you think you're doing? Hey, man. I got the video you sent me. Wow. You got style. You

576
02:19:34,229 --> 02:19:39,270
are on the team. You're definitely on the team. I'm going to find a way to get you down to the

577
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:45,190
Tampa Am Contest. Tampa? What? That would be insane. But I have like three bucks to my name.

578
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:49,110
Why do I have yellow gloves on? Don't matter, man. I'll tell you what. You run some errands

579
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:53,190
for me in New York and I'll floor you my vintage bus for the trip. Now tell me what you want to

580
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:58,139
ride and I'll send you all the free gear you need for the event, dude. I got a new outfit.

581
02:19:59,430 --> 02:20:03,270
Free gear from Peralta is now available in Skate Shop. You can now return to the Skate Shop from

582
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:17,770
the Edit Skater menu. Dex. Oh, hold on. Almost. All right. So I do the Almond Joy.

583
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:33,620
Baker. I think I like Almond Joy. Sorry. Yeah, I like the Almond Joy one. Grip tape.

584
02:20:34,819 --> 02:20:40,549
Grip tape. Solid. This just looks like something fucked up. I like it.

585
02:20:42,069 --> 02:20:55,290
Oh, like the molten lava one. Yep. Grip tape color. Green. Grip tape froze. No, I'm a pro.

586
02:20:56,090 --> 02:21:02,360
Oh, it has to be black, right? All right, that's fine. That looks good. Wheel color.

587
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:26,739
That like bright blue. I just did poker table green. No, I didn't. Whatever. Astro turf green.

588
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:46,229
Bovine Ernie. That's a boomer board. Whatever. Favorites for a ride. Hello, you.

589
02:21:54,229 --> 02:21:57,350
I am not going to turn it up. It's in a perfect spot.

590
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:24,459
And restaurant. Okay, no comply. Five times. How do I even pop that up? Good. You'll learn

591
02:22:24,459 --> 02:22:42,149
over an obstacle. Apply this technique versus new will be delicious. No comply. Manual and then

592
02:22:42,149 --> 02:22:49,670
manual and then trick out manual. No comply onto the no comply into a manual on the bench

593
02:22:49,670 --> 02:23:02,549
and flick your gut. Soon we will fuse the boneless into modern music but first you must practice.

594
02:23:04,069 --> 02:23:11,459
Remember, the boneless will give you extra height and distance. Boneless.

595
02:23:21,209 --> 02:23:25,290
This one would be almost impossible to jump over. You can jump over with a boneless.

596
02:23:25,290 --> 02:23:34,889
It's a simple task. This will be the ultimate fusion of new and old. Get some speed and

597
02:23:34,889 --> 02:23:40,250
boneless off the lip of this quarter pipe. This should give you enough air to do a huge

598
02:23:40,250 --> 02:23:47,459
vertric. Accomplishing this will bring boneless pizza. Boneless off the cube.

599
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:18,379
Boneless into a grind. Another grind. Manual and then off that into a royal flush.

600
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:36,379
People that are just showing up for the first time that haven't been watching the stream

601
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:39,180
are randomly going to see that trick and it's they're going to be blinking their eyes going

602
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:48,680
what how how is that in the game? Man, damn kids, I was supposed to have some new decks

603
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:53,959
delivered to the sponsors by the start of the show. I just did. You can get them back in time

604
02:24:53,959 --> 02:25:18,329
it'd really save our ass. Okay, find the punks who stole the decks. It's not gonna work.

605
02:25:18,329 --> 02:25:43,239
Where are the punks? Oh, I found a punk. Wink. Steal a deck and get away with it.

606
02:25:55,899 --> 02:26:17,930
Where'd he go? Oh, two punks. I just went through the hoop for any three more punks.

607
02:26:19,129 --> 02:26:48,379
What is that guy over here? I saw his indicator. Oh, you're out. Oh, you. Okay. I just accidentally

608
02:26:48,379 --> 02:26:57,829
got one. He says we can borrow his old hippie bus and hit the road. He's accumulating wink debt.

609
02:27:10,709 --> 02:27:28,020
Going to Tampa. Check. We apparently didn't make it to Tampa, I guess. I'm assuming.

610
02:27:28,899 --> 02:27:35,739
One bad bumper sticker. Oh, big mistake, you punks. Oh, that was horrible.

611
02:27:40,649 --> 02:27:45,370
Aren't you white meat supposed to be out fighting real crime? Like figuring out where that missing

612
02:27:45,370 --> 02:27:52,489
sprinkled donut went. Oh, that's real funny, smart ass. Kiss your little roller skating contest.

613
02:27:52,489 --> 02:27:56,250
Goodbye. That is unless your buddy here wants to do us some favors.

614
02:27:56,969 --> 02:28:09,590
I got the two backpacks on his knees. All right, chapter seven with syrup or jelly.

615
02:28:10,629 --> 02:28:20,120
Just, oh, Tampa's cool. Wait, what's this? We just got a very rare T-pose, by the way.

616
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:26,840
Hey, get special. They do a yeah right manual through the cones down the Pro Bowl.

617
02:28:27,719 --> 02:28:30,360
Special and do a yeah right manual through the cones.

618
02:28:31,159 --> 02:28:49,319
Uh, that's get special. Okay, let's go. Get special. I'm doing yeah, right through the cone.

619
02:28:53,430 --> 02:29:04,260
What? Now that you got that down, get special, then skip this car. You suck.

620
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:10,340
Then do a yeah, right through the cone. Oh yeah, you only get one chance. I don't choke it.

621
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:26,870
One chance. Get special. Don't mess it up, you goof. Okay, now get special and then

622
02:29:28,069 --> 02:29:53,829
it's the car and then yeah, right through the cones. Wait, will I just get special by doing this?

623
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:26,629
Yeah, right. It's next turn. Yeah, just rush. That's it. That's how I think that's my,

624
02:30:26,629 --> 02:30:33,540
you might not be getting up from that one. Oh, that hurts. You're dead. That kills you.

625
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:39,100
That actually, I think that actually kills you. All this individual stickers everywhere.

626
02:30:43,180 --> 02:30:53,370
Jump into the wall at an angle, then jump while wall riding to Wally and access hard

627
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:59,209
to reach high spots. Jump while we're on. Okay, wall ride, jump while wall riding.

628
02:31:00,489 --> 02:31:10,500
Get all the stickers. Cool. There's one, here comes two. Gonna get a better line here.

629
02:31:11,219 --> 02:31:34,520
Okay, I see another sticker. More back here. What's that? Wait, what the fuck was

630
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:52,120
I just looking at? I don't know. It was weird. Need more stickers. Sticker, sticker. There's two

631
02:31:52,120 --> 02:32:06,299
more. Is that a sticker? No. This one. One more. What's that up there? Look at that.

632
02:32:08,729 --> 02:32:57,579
Come on. Where's the final sticker? No. Where's the last sticker? Shit. I don't think I'm gonna

633
02:32:57,579 --> 02:33:20,549
find it. Right over here. Rats. Anyone just come to the stream? Like, anybody just like,

634
02:33:20,549 --> 02:33:28,549
just kind of show up right now? Welcome to the stream. Anyone that just showed up for Tony Hawk?

635
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:46,139
Pretty fun game. It's a pretty good game. All right, let's see. What else can we do here?

636
02:33:47,479 --> 02:33:50,600
Remove all the stickers. Get the best donuts. We'll do this one.

637
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:56,200
Why don't you put yourself to some use? Go get some donuts for me and my fellow officers.

638
02:33:57,079 --> 02:34:21,139
Twelve donuts. Okay, let's go like this. Grab here, up there. Not enough momentum. Two, three.

639
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:44,549
Okay, there's another one right here. Oh, there's a big line. Oh, that hurt. I'm trying to go over

640
02:34:44,549 --> 02:35:18,489
it. Just grab it. Okay. Oh, look at this. Well, I didn't press the button fast enough.

641
02:35:28,969 --> 02:35:36,780
All right, what do you got? A mission for me? Oh, the stickers. Okay, let's get it.

642
02:35:43,079 --> 02:35:53,739
There's one up there. One behind the new girl's place. One on the wall back here.

643
02:35:54,700 --> 02:36:41,049
One over here. And this one. Back here, right? No. Oh, I think it's the one I didn't get last time.

644
02:36:41,049 --> 02:37:03,319
Did I get this one last time? I don't think so. I think I did. One right here. Okay, there's one more.

645
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:55,860
It has to be down here. That's it. Those aren't stickers. I have no idea where it is. This way.

646
02:37:58,659 --> 02:38:05,739
Oh, I'm missing this one every time.

647
02:38:11,930 --> 02:38:28,629
Okay, Lapid doesn't know. No, I don't. Every Tony Hawk game, I was always so awful with the

648
02:38:28,629 --> 02:39:10,170
collect-the-thing. I just skipped every single one of them. Is there one down here? Fuck,

649
02:39:10,170 --> 02:39:15,909
it's right there. Okay, right there. I didn't get that one. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no,

650
02:39:15,909 --> 02:39:26,059
no, no. Let's go. Come on, I need to get to the last two. All right, where's the script club place?

651
02:39:27,909 --> 02:39:43,139
He didn't know. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. Don't tell him. Nobody tell him.

652
02:39:44,260 --> 02:39:55,899
Hey, anybody just showing up for the first time? What else we got? Skateboarding bandit

653
02:39:55,899 --> 02:40:02,280
and help the private eyes. Let's do skateboarding bandit. Someone has just robbed the bank and is

654
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:07,000
escaping up there through the skyway. If you follow the drop cache, it should lead you right to him.

655
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:33,290
Okay. Oh, damn. Let's do it again. Oh, I did a cool move there. Nailed. Am I not going? Oh,

656
02:40:33,290 --> 02:41:38,409
I only have five seconds. Okay, right. Jesus. Holy shit. This is fast. Did I get it? Okay,

657
02:41:38,409 --> 02:41:44,040
so if I jump off this, I go off to the left. I don't know why that happens. The way my thumb

658
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:49,239
is pressing on, you know what I'm saying? The way my thumb's pressing, it just always pushes me to

659
02:41:49,239 --> 02:42:11,639
the top left. That's not helping either. Damn it. See what I'm talking about? Like I just like top

660
02:42:11,639 --> 02:42:16,889
left because just the way that my hand naturally presses up, it just goes up to the top left.

661
02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:29,340
How did I fail that?

662
02:42:58,170 --> 02:43:01,450
Is he high right now? No, I just... It's hard to do that.

663
02:43:11,579 --> 02:43:48,440
Jed. No! There's Jed! No! There's the other Jed sign. Jed. Jed? Jed? That's screen tearing though.

664
02:43:49,399 --> 02:43:56,649
Jed. There's the Jed. Oh, I gotta... Come on.

665
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:19,979
Ditch the car. Why is there a lose the cops thing? Okay.

666
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:35,989
I want to rock and roll. All right. Wait, is this like... This is not the actual song.

667
02:44:38,309 --> 02:44:56,920
It's a live version. How is driving in a circle around the same block losing the cops?

668
02:44:58,280 --> 02:45:20,489
Not what happened. This is not... Why would the third guy go over? The third guy...

669
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:28,709
You just watched two of us drive into the water and you're going to do it too or whatever.

670
02:45:31,959 --> 02:45:33,559
Nice driving. Now let's get out of here.

671
02:45:39,319 --> 02:45:51,000
Save it. Tampa AM 2004 check in.

672
02:46:00,819 --> 02:46:04,899
AKA now you're under arrest for fucking assaulting somebody. You just don't... No,

673
02:46:04,899 --> 02:46:07,219
you just slapped somebody. You don't... You slapped him in the fucking face.

674
02:46:11,459 --> 02:46:15,459
Dude, look, I'll sign up now. I told you the list is full.

675
02:46:15,459 --> 02:46:21,459
Feel free to watch from the bleachers though. Yo Thomasville, what's up street dog? You been

676
02:46:21,459 --> 02:46:30,940
shrouded in any 10 story rails with the old magic stunt wood? Yeah, I'm sorry about this. But

677
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:35,899
anyway, I gotta go skate. I mean, this could be my big break and who knows? Maybe you could

678
02:46:35,899 --> 02:46:41,100
impress a pro or something to get into. This is going to be a double cross. Yeah.

679
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:55,260
He's going to be mean to me and shit and he's going to be like, you were always a loser.

680
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,299
You were always nothing and I'm going to have to beat him in the final.

681
02:46:59,989 --> 02:47:04,469
You skate pretty well kid. There's a couple of things I want to see you do before you're ready

682
02:47:04,469 --> 02:47:17,610
for the Tampa AM. First, land a trick with a spin. I'm going to be okay with this because I spin

683
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:52,739
every time I do anything. Land a trick with at least a 540 and a revert. That's cool. I need

684
02:47:52,819 --> 02:48:10,170
any more pros. I like this place. Tampa's cool. Can't get in. So is there a reason why?

685
02:48:13,239 --> 02:48:17,000
I guess maybe there is a reason why, but I just don't like to admit it or something.

686
02:48:18,709 --> 02:48:21,909
Why has there never been another skating game like this?

687
02:48:22,790 --> 02:48:26,340
Just kind of fall out of popular culture and people just didn't really care anymore or something.

688
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:45,940
All right, let's get out of here. Pretty much. Didn't Tony Hawk make a new game

689
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:48,979
this year or last year? It was like an iPad game or something.

690
02:48:50,100 --> 02:49:13,030
Was it any good? Really bad. It was very bad. Let's see what we got here. Party boat skate tricks.

691
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:17,909
Welcome to Wet Beaver's party boat. Bam. This party is boring as hell.

692
02:49:17,909 --> 02:49:21,270
Let's liven it up with some skating. Nail the tricks I yell out.

693
02:49:22,229 --> 02:49:33,350
He'll flip. Of course, the same person is getting hurt every time.

694
02:49:35,139 --> 02:49:38,100
You're leaning too far in, man. I'm hitting you in the face every time I go up.

695
02:49:39,059 --> 02:50:27,909
It's like giving me anxiety. I'm the same guy. Don't stand in the way. Oh, boy. I'm telling you.

696
02:50:27,909 --> 02:50:31,909
It's me hitting the people is what's freaking me out. I have to turn the volume off.

697
02:50:31,909 --> 02:51:13,110
Oh, he used to cheat code. Reminding me of my past meltdowns.

698
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:17,270
All right, let's go skate some spots around Tampa. Let's see if you can beat my combos

699
02:51:17,270 --> 02:51:37,620
while you're at it. Maybe. Beat Andrew's three best combos. What is that? That's pretty wild.

700
02:51:40,149 --> 02:51:54,329
What combo, Andrew? Andrew, I just destroyed your combo.

701
02:51:54,329 --> 02:52:15,739
Again, let's do it again, Andrew. Well, I got to do it in a row. I just didn't realize where I was.

702
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:49,000
No, stop. OK, next one. Now, this is the one on the roof. Jump over it and land.

703
02:52:49,000 --> 02:53:13,850
It's going to go like this. Oh, fuck. No, fell off. Shit. All right. Fancy. What?

704
02:53:14,489 --> 02:53:41,239
This is like a ball jump. It's a molding stream in the making. No, this is the nature of Tony Hawkman.

705
02:53:42,040 --> 02:54:15,299
All right, let's get this one. Motherfucker. Streamer, look inside yourself. Wall plant combo.

706
02:54:15,299 --> 02:54:19,540
I bet you can't wall plant off the drawbridge to wall. Here's where I learned how to do it straight

707
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:27,690
into a wall and hit this jump straight into a wall and hit this then manual all the way down

708
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:47,159
through the cones in one combo. Hurry up. There's some balance here. Oh, I got points.

709
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:53,559
Let's see if you can impress him by nailing the tricks I yell out. And for variety,

710
02:54:53,559 --> 02:54:58,280
I'm going to throw in Tony Hawk. I wonder what he's going to say. Hey, man, nice work over there on

711
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:02,200
those grinds. You did such a good job. I'm going to make sure I give the word and that you can do

712
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:04,280
that. And then you can do the competition in Tampa.

713
02:55:16,809 --> 02:55:29,780
Flip. 540 flip. He'll flip. He'll flip. I'm not doing it. He'll flip. He'll flip. What? He'll flip.

714
02:55:29,780 --> 02:56:07,379
He'll flip. He'll flip. He'll flip. Oh, a 540. Whoops. I didn't even try to do it. I didn't even

715
02:56:07,379 --> 02:56:25,420
try. No, I need to do an Indy. Why am I doing an air walk? Hey, you skate pretty well. Let's see

716
02:56:25,420 --> 02:56:32,149
if you can hang with me. It's because of the Xbox buttons, the left and right. Here he is. Let's

717
02:56:32,149 --> 02:56:54,600
see if you can hang with me. Beat Tony's score. I can't win this. That's the legendary Tony Hawk.

718
02:57:15,559 --> 02:57:20,200
Whoa. What do you call those moves, man? Oh, I'm just destroying him.

719
02:57:24,489 --> 02:57:31,020
Carrillo. Oh, this game is so fucking fun.

720
02:57:44,860 --> 02:57:48,379
All right. I beat the shit out of him. He just doesn't even stand a chance.

721
02:57:59,129 --> 02:58:00,569
Eric did better than Tony Hawk.

722
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:14,280
For the Tampa and talk about a surprise attack. If you stay on your board tomorrow,

723
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:19,159
you'll walk away with the contest. I can't. It's full. I worked so hard to get a sponsorship

724
02:58:19,159 --> 02:58:24,680
from Stacy Peralta. Stacy Peralta? I know that dude. He was my first sponsor too, back in the 80s.

725
02:58:25,319 --> 02:58:31,159
Is he still into yoga? That's one weird dude. But cool as they come. Look, I can't make any

726
02:58:31,159 --> 02:58:36,200
guarantees, but I'll talk to the guys at the contest. Just show up tomorrow. This was way

727
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:40,280
better than I thought it was going to be acting wise. It was very good. That was actually just,

728
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:46,469
that was very natural. Tony Hawk, like actually naturally good actor. Well, pretty good.

729
02:58:47,430 --> 02:58:51,909
By the way, if Tony Hawk can't get you into a skating competition, then no one can.

730
02:58:52,469 --> 02:58:56,229
I don't think the president can like executive order get you in if Tony Hawk can't.

731
02:58:57,190 --> 02:59:12,940
That was good. Got a tight street comp going on. Best two out of three runs. Stay inside on the

732
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:24,360
street course. Tight street comp going on. Best two out of three. Let's go. Oops.

733
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:21,590
91 to 88. All right. 90. Best step two out of three. That one, sorry.

734
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:51,739
43,000. What is that? 95? Yeah. All right. 90. 93. Rob. I don't like that place no more.

735
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:12,739
Now what? Talk to Afro Gym. There's some cool stuff on this here roof to trick on.

736
03:01:12,739 --> 03:01:17,139
Climb up there and I'll meet you. You just have to jump up, grab on, and pull yourself up.

737
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:45,899
All the way up to the ladder. Hey, I just showed up. What is with the bar tricks?

738
03:01:47,899 --> 03:02:01,379
I'm so glad. I'm so happy. That makes me so happy. Okay. Try and beat my high score. Stay on the

739
03:02:01,379 --> 03:02:47,500
rooftops. Oh, that's not a roof? How's that not a rooftop? Okay. Take it easy. Too easy to get too

740
03:02:47,500 --> 03:03:03,719
much momentum and fly off. I have two minutes. I know everyone's going to call me a cheeseball

741
03:03:03,719 --> 03:03:30,090
for doing this, but that's fine. Oh, that's a broken arm.

742
03:03:38,540 --> 03:03:42,540
9,000. All right. All right. I need like, I just need to kick flip in front like one or twice.

743
03:03:52,739 --> 03:03:54,020
You fucking cheeseball.

744
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:58,659
With the lowest score gets eliminated. You're in a big combo. Don't worry. Those points count

745
03:03:58,659 --> 03:04:03,459
toward your score as long as you don't fail. Last two skaters advance. Every 30 seconds,

746
03:04:03,459 --> 03:04:22,780
the skater with the lowest score gets eliminated. Sorry, guys. You're dealing with a fucking pro.

747
03:04:23,739 --> 03:04:43,399
Dude, I have 31. Wait, I have 31,000 points. How am I out of the competition?

748
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:53,879
What? I'm not. I mean, what? How am I not in first place?

749
03:04:53,879 --> 03:05:24,549
Guys, best trick competition. I'm so confused. Well, I have 48,000 points,

750
03:05:24,549 --> 03:05:32,020
but I'm not even on the list. Best trick pop to advance. All right. Well, aren't we all just in

751
03:05:32,020 --> 03:05:45,219
here every 30 seconds to eliminate somebody. So why am I not on the list?

752
03:05:55,770 --> 03:06:04,010
Why am I, why do I have a small brain? You see your own score. Yeah, but I mean, why wouldn't

753
03:06:04,010 --> 03:06:20,329
it be on the, it told me like, oh, you're out of the competition area. I'm like, oh, I didn't know.

754
03:06:21,129 --> 03:06:37,209
I'm sorry. So I have 44,000 points. I'm in first place. Okay. So I can't really lose

755
03:06:46,540 --> 03:07:18,780
sloppily doubling everybody's point. 30 seconds. All right. All right. Let's go.

756
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:56,100
Get into some good here. Good line. Fuck. Sorry. Just me and Eric. Biggest score.

757
03:08:23,739 --> 03:08:43,579
Trying to do the special. Choke, choke, choke.

758
03:09:06,040 --> 03:09:11,459
Revert and manual. I do, I do manuals as much as I can, but like the revert into the manual,

759
03:09:11,459 --> 03:09:15,139
you'd like revert manual. It's a brain kind of fucking freezes up.

760
03:09:27,739 --> 03:09:33,020
Five seconds and let me talk to the damn kid. I gotta give it to you. That run was bullshit.

761
03:09:33,579 --> 03:09:36,860
No, in a good way though. I'm gonna have to put you on element bottom line.

762
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:44,870
Oh, I'm on element. All the major deck companies are after you. Time to check out some videos to

763
03:09:44,870 --> 03:09:57,020
see which sponsor best fits your style. The choice is yours. Birdhouse, Sean White,

764
03:09:57,020 --> 03:10:11,930
and then the Olympian. What is a snowboarder? Holy shit. He's skated. Wow. Vinny Vegas.

765
03:10:39,020 --> 03:11:01,239
Bam Margera. Bam Margera. Here's the thing about Bam Margera. The reason why half of

766
03:11:01,239 --> 03:11:32,709
us think anything is funny is because of Bam Margera. Bam invented comedy, but that,

767
03:11:32,709 --> 03:11:41,030
that like style of like alternative comedy, like Jackass. They're like Johnny Knoxville.

768
03:11:41,030 --> 03:11:59,719
Those guys were just, they were nuts. That was pretty, that was horribly morbid. Holy shit.

769
03:12:01,989 --> 03:12:17,340
I don't think I want to join the life sucks gang. There's no skateboard there.

770
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:31,610
All right. I like this. All right. Okay. I kind of liked that one because that was just like,

771
03:12:31,610 --> 03:13:02,440
that was pretty funny. I kind of like, yeah, right. Pretty good. This game is what made me

772
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:10,920
want to be a graphics artist. I think like the thing about skateboarding, skateboarding in like

773
03:13:10,920 --> 03:13:17,079
the mid nineties into the early two thousands influenced so many random other cultures that

774
03:13:17,079 --> 03:13:25,799
have like counter cultures that moved in a million different places. It's spread out everywhere.

775
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:39,500
Fashion, graphic design, videos, making funny videos, videos, skateboarding groups would make

776
03:13:40,059 --> 03:13:45,850
skits and shit. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about like Bam Margera and those guys

777
03:13:45,850 --> 03:13:49,850
are some of the reasons why we have to have the shit that we think is funny. It's funny because

778
03:13:49,850 --> 03:13:57,639
they like did the skits. It influenced so many things that you can't even wrap your brain around.

779
03:14:01,129 --> 03:14:07,129
All right. For a second, I thought this had John Birdhouse, John Element, John Flip, John Girl,

780
03:14:07,129 --> 03:14:17,370
John Zero. This is going to be tough. All right. I like the fun editing in Girl. We just had a

781
03:14:17,370 --> 03:14:23,530
bunch of subs coming in though. No, we didn't. It was a ton of money. King of Troll gets 10,000

782
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:27,930
bits, a hundred bucks. Put this forward something nice to him. I will. Thanks to the huge,

783
03:14:27,930 --> 03:14:40,260
ridiculous amount of money. I like the, as King of Troll, 10. Thank you. It's either going to be

784
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:50,729
Girl or, that's going to be Girl. Welcome to Girl. Gear up and then you'll be flowing out to San

785
03:14:50,729 --> 03:15:18,139
Diego to meet the rest of your team. All right. Let's gear up. I like my Almond Joy. It's a real

786
03:15:18,139 --> 03:15:27,909
color. I like Almond Joy. No, I can't. It's my board. I can't get rid of it. That's your sponsor.

787
03:15:34,979 --> 03:15:41,829
Hey, what's up? You get in from the airport? Okay. Yeah. Are you Todd? Hey, I want to sponsor,

788
03:15:41,829 --> 03:15:45,350
but I'm not going to put any of your stuff on. I got to finish this meal before I go out to eat.

789
03:15:45,350 --> 03:15:49,670
So here's my skateboarding 101 spiel. The more coverage you get, the more crazy tricks you land,

790
03:15:49,670 --> 03:15:53,989
the more tours and free gear for you. Okay. Just push yourself, show us your Skittles and everything

791
03:15:53,989 --> 03:16:01,510
is cool. Skittles. Skills. Skittles mean skills. What are you from Idaho? Hey, look, the film is

792
03:16:01,510 --> 03:16:05,030
here to shoot some other guys. Go piggyback with them and get some coverage. All right. Look at

793
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:19,450
those bit maps, spaghetti, french fries. It looks so good. All right. Prove yourself worthy.

794
03:16:25,100 --> 03:16:38,520
All right. Your HUD changes too. That's cool. Rare T-pose study. We got. What do we got to do

795
03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:44,760
for coverage these days? There's one that nobody will volunteer for. There's a bunch of flower boxes

796
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:49,399
up on that sketchy ledge and they want a picture of one of us grinding some of them down. Okay.

797
03:16:51,700 --> 03:17:05,190
You're a newbie. You're up, newbie. All right. So grind the boxes. Did I screw it up? Did I mess

798
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:26,969
it up? Yes, I did. Oh boy. Okay. Did I get them all? Oh, that's tricky. This is tough. All right.

799
03:17:46,729 --> 03:18:07,559
Oh, I missed one. I think I can get back up there. Right here. Where was it? No, you got to get it in

800
03:18:07,559 --> 03:18:44,149
one go. You got to get it in one go. Oops. Floppy, but sloppy. What happened there? That was lame.

801
03:18:44,870 --> 03:19:07,079
No, it's lame maybe. Not the job done. Yes. What do you mean timing? That's the guy from American

802
03:19:07,079 --> 03:19:17,079
Dead. That's the boyfriend. All right. Let's do this. Let me see something basic for starters.

803
03:19:17,079 --> 03:20:01,770
Yes. Yes. That's Jeff from American Dead. Double kickflip over the stairs. It needs to be faster

804
03:20:01,770 --> 03:20:34,459
than that. There we go. Jeff, I did a triple kickflip. You can use it. Why can I not hit

805
03:20:34,459 --> 03:21:13,989
this? Bang, bang. Bang, bang. Jeff, you got film in that camera? Double impossible over the stairs.

806
03:21:15,590 --> 03:21:53,340
That was pretty cool. What's that called? Impossible? Come on. Stop doing that. Stop

807
03:21:53,340 --> 03:22:04,229
doing the worst move. I don't even have special. Please wake up. You're unconscious.

808
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:13,319
Jeremy, please. Wake up. What are you doing? All right. Air out the atrium. All right. Here it is.

809
03:22:13,319 --> 03:22:19,319
They want pictures of you blasting some big grab airs. Above us is a nice open gap over the front

810
03:22:19,319 --> 03:22:27,700
of this atrium. It's perfect for these photos. Work up speed back and forth and do the grabs that I

811
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:33,700
tell you. Use a boneless to jump higher if you need to. Melon over the gap.

812
03:22:48,260 --> 03:23:20,549
I got it, right? That wasn't it? Oh, I get it. I just felt like that was a melon. That was a melon.

813
03:23:21,270 --> 03:24:04,549
Okay, I'll go out of the room. Hold on. That was a melon. How was that? That's not the gap.

814
03:24:05,110 --> 03:24:07,510
I don't understand. I have to hit the gap?

815
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:39,639
How was that any different? I don't understand. Actually, let's take break number one. Let's take

816
03:24:39,639 --> 03:24:43,719
a full break. I'm going to get some water. It's been three and a half hours. First break of the

817
03:24:43,719 --> 03:29:25,719
night. I am back. I got myself a sprite on the rocks. Joe Otto? He's not even in the room anymore.

818
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:40,149
How's Otto after the surgery? He is fully healed. Stitches have been removed. He is back to 100%

819
03:29:40,149 --> 03:29:49,750
normal. He's good to go. He's healed up very nicely. All right. Something a little tougher over the gap.

820
03:29:50,709 --> 03:30:06,260
It's stiffy. I need some air. Let's get some air from here. Here we go. This will be it.

821
03:30:10,020 --> 03:30:17,750
Just watch. I'm going to lose this twice.

822
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:43,180
Oh, shit. I'm so bad at this.

823
03:30:58,540 --> 03:30:59,260
Oh, that was it.

824
03:31:03,260 --> 03:31:10,250
That was it. I did it.

825
03:31:11,620 --> 03:31:18,579
Oh, kid. You've got serious skills. How about another tough one over? Go for it.

826
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:21,940
This is rocket air over the gap.

827
03:31:30,260 --> 03:31:36,579
I was not even in range of the photo. Crazy. You're unstoppable. They just want one more shot.

828
03:31:36,579 --> 03:31:41,459
Let me see something really big over it. We're done here. One foot tail grab.

829
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:52,819
Six, and I still can't let them. All right, newbie. You want comfort. You gotta get creative.

830
03:31:52,819 --> 03:31:58,739
Nail this run. Your picture will be in a magazine ad for sure. All right. I'll call out the tricks

831
03:31:58,739 --> 03:32:04,979
and the team photographer will snap the photos. A really long spear or lance. How do you hold that?

832
03:32:07,540 --> 03:32:11,219
I feel like that thing would turn. You know when we have a tape measure out too far and the thing

833
03:32:11,219 --> 03:32:16,700
just goes to shit when it's out like that. I feel like that's impossible to hold and throw.

834
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:24,200
You just worry about busting them over the spine transfer on the statue.

835
03:32:24,200 --> 03:32:29,079
Rock and roll, kid. Busting them over the spine transfer.

836
03:32:37,500 --> 03:32:39,899
All right, I see. You get this L&R over the statue.

837
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:55,799
Cool. Bring it back. I get it. I get it. Tail grab over the statue.

838
03:32:59,850 --> 03:33:09,079
Sloppy, but I did it. You want a bunch of kickflips. Sure, I can do that. No, I can't.

839
03:33:20,200 --> 03:33:31,270
L, R, up, and X. It's like scratch your head, rub your face. Hold down X,

840
03:33:32,069 --> 03:33:38,549
L, R, and then we let go of A, up, R. It's like a lot of my brain's processes.

841
03:33:39,510 --> 03:34:07,530
Good. Try to do one at a time. Indie, then go over the statue. Melon.

842
03:34:16,299 --> 03:34:25,030
Technically got it. Well, I'm going to make a joke or I'm going to drop out of high school.

843
03:34:25,989 --> 03:34:29,979
Sorry, you're not going to be getting your diploma.

844
03:34:42,500 --> 03:34:54,170
I don't like this one. I got to do two tricks in a row.

845
03:34:55,049 --> 03:35:01,639
What do we got? Indie. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

846
03:35:04,709 --> 03:35:15,000
Okay, thank god it's a bunch of impossible in a row.

847
03:35:19,579 --> 03:35:26,389
Kickflip. What the fuck was that? What? I didn't even want to do that, man.

848
03:35:27,989 --> 03:35:57,450
Look at all these tricks. This might be it. I'm not going to get it. No more grab moves.

849
03:36:01,180 --> 03:36:04,620
Make a joke. No, how many of you guys are going to drop out of high school if I don't make a joke

850
03:36:04,620 --> 03:36:28,659
in 10 minutes? Stay in school for fuck's sake. But I graduated. Well, that's good.

851
03:36:29,700 --> 03:36:36,780
Don't drop out of school because I didn't make a joke. All right. That first is just fucking with

852
03:36:36,780 --> 03:37:38,819
me. Indie. No, do it again. Does that count? Not really. No grabs. No, just turn around and do it.

853
03:37:39,700 --> 03:37:52,120
Okay, nose grab, heel flip. It wasn't a nose grab. Why? I just did up and B.

854
03:37:53,239 --> 03:38:09,020
That's it. That one was hard. Real wink. Every day we get darker and darker.

855
03:38:26,040 --> 03:38:31,399
What was the mission that the person said? If I do it within four tries, they'll give me like

856
03:38:31,399 --> 03:38:34,680
a hundred dollars. It's like an impossible mission that they would like. This mission

857
03:38:34,680 --> 03:38:37,239
sucks. You're going to hate it. But if you do it within four tries, I'll give you a hundred bucks.

858
03:38:38,360 --> 03:38:53,690
Which one was it? It was like the spot, like the cool spot one, the cool spot or something.

859
03:38:53,690 --> 03:39:02,020
Big apple spot challenge. Yeah. Okay. The big apple spot challenge. If I beat that within four

860
03:39:02,020 --> 03:39:07,579
tries, they'll give me a hundred dollars. Nobody said that. Wow. Wow. Wow. Why would I even know

861
03:39:07,579 --> 03:39:15,290
what that is? The cool, the apple, big apple spot. Man, we need to get some flyers thrown around

862
03:39:15,290 --> 03:39:22,379
for this party. I said, I know it. Okay. I said I would throw up a cheese steak on my keyboard,

863
03:39:22,379 --> 03:39:29,959
not give you a hundred dollars. I said nothing about a hundred dollars. You fucking greedy streamer.

864
03:39:38,100 --> 03:39:44,739
Well, hold on a minute. Are you eating a cheese steak right now? Because that would make you a

865
03:39:44,739 --> 03:39:54,180
liar if I did it within four tries. Like, did you, are you eating a cheese steak today?

866
03:39:59,860 --> 03:40:04,920
Slap these flies around by doing wall plants. Okay. Cool. You'll see the spots where we want

867
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:10,819
to put up. What the fuck? I'm literally eating a cheese steak. Well, you don't, but you don't

868
03:40:10,819 --> 03:40:47,940
have to throw it up onto your keyboard if I do it in four tries. Hold on a minute. He has a green

869
03:40:47,940 --> 03:41:17,399
shirt on. Fuck. Nevermind. Oh, he got a friend. Don't just restart. It's fine. You don't have to

870
03:41:17,399 --> 03:41:28,840
restart every time. What is he pretending? Stop pretending. There's no way this is not,

871
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:49,819
there's no way this guy's not pretending right now. There's two more. One here.

872
03:41:55,190 --> 03:42:10,200
Great Marie's dumb. Great Marie's dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. I'm not dumb. You're dumb.

873
03:42:10,200 --> 03:42:22,659
I'm not dumb. You're dumb. What do you got? The band that's playing your party. We stopped to get

874
03:42:22,659 --> 03:42:29,159
some grub and while we were out some joker snaked our instruments. He's killing his streaming career.

875
03:42:31,819 --> 03:42:34,940
Can you help us find him? Otherwise, we can't play for you guys.

876
03:42:35,579 --> 03:42:38,540
All right, get the instruments. They're probably gonna be on a line here.

877
03:42:39,579 --> 03:42:41,979
I was gonna guess. I'd be like, yeah, there's one.

878
03:42:43,979 --> 03:42:59,799
Upset. Brums. I see a microphone.

879
03:43:08,170 --> 03:43:19,110
I see. Let's go this way. There's a place where everyone can be happy.

880
03:43:19,110 --> 03:43:22,149
Isn't the most beautiful place in the whole wide fucking world. That's the best song.

881
03:43:50,920 --> 03:44:16,819
Oh, that's gonna be actually tricky to get to. Climb it. Really? The one place that hurts

882
03:44:17,780 --> 03:44:30,440
is your knee. Those must be inflatable then. Get up in the chat. What's up, dude?

883
03:44:34,889 --> 03:44:43,940
Grab that gardener's cart. Find a few ladies. Do whatever it takes to get them back here.

884
03:44:45,940 --> 03:44:50,100
Don't be slacking. If you don't hurry up, this party's gonna be over before it really starts.

885
03:44:51,459 --> 03:44:58,659
Tony, let me do some consulting work for you. I love these games and as you can see,

886
03:44:58,659 --> 03:45:03,299
I get 20 to 30,000 points when I get in a line so I know the game.

887
03:45:07,209 --> 03:45:10,729
Maybe if you show me how handy you are with that skateboard, I'll come to your party.

888
03:45:10,729 --> 03:45:23,139
How about showing me a combo? You want to say a combo? Show me a combo. How's that?

889
03:45:23,940 --> 03:45:41,540
Shit. Did you just hit my car? Stay right there. I'll do it. My face is a Jehovah.

890
03:46:03,190 --> 03:46:12,520
Coming to the party. Wait, pick up girls for the party. I can only have one person in this car.

891
03:46:13,479 --> 03:46:23,750
Well, she'd go anywhere. I'm not that easy. If you want me to go to your party,

892
03:46:23,750 --> 03:46:27,030
you're gonna have to show me more. How about some of those neat freestyle tricks?

893
03:46:27,030 --> 03:46:30,069
What do you mean freestyle tricks? Start manually and show me some tricks.

894
03:46:44,950 --> 03:46:47,270
You're asking a lot in a row.

895
03:46:53,159 --> 03:47:17,030
Okay, who cares? I'm just gonna go this way.

896
03:47:17,030 --> 03:47:53,030
Be an X. That's a weird combo to do. It's hard. Your hands can't do that.

897
03:47:59,979 --> 03:48:04,489
I have to be in front of you? Why can't you just walk with me?

898
03:48:15,510 --> 03:48:17,510
I'm doing it. Look.

899
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:47,500
Damn it. This is fucking tricky.

900
03:48:54,299 --> 03:48:57,500
Bill Emanuel, you motherfucker.

901
03:49:18,819 --> 03:49:23,299
Are you happy? All right, let's go.

902
03:49:26,100 --> 03:49:29,299
Make room and I'll come to the party.

903
03:49:39,340 --> 03:49:52,979
Everybody good? I thought it was a ramp.

904
03:50:05,100 --> 03:50:07,100
NA navigation.

905
03:50:14,780 --> 03:50:17,100
Whoa, I just like this. What the fuck did I just do?

906
03:50:29,850 --> 03:51:11,500
All right, do I have to be in front of you? Let me see. No, good. Car hop. Oh, don't reset.

907
03:51:12,389 --> 03:51:22,420
No, don't flush her. What I Xbox 360.

908
03:51:23,139 --> 03:51:43,579
I'm coming to your party. Even if I do have to write in that thing. Let's go.

909
03:51:43,579 --> 03:52:17,879
Jerma looks like the mom from Dexter's lab. Yeah. Yeah, kind of. Kind of. Whatever.

910
03:52:27,239 --> 03:52:32,520
If I flip this thing, I don't hurt anybody. All right, we got a full house.

911
03:52:33,319 --> 03:52:44,260
Hey, I snuck out of the party and hooked up some real fun. What does that mean?

912
03:52:44,260 --> 03:52:48,579
I snaked one of those cards from behind the epitheter. Okay. And some of the other guys

913
03:52:48,579 --> 03:52:53,989
set up a little racetrack for us. See if you can beat my best lap. In the car?

914
03:52:53,989 --> 03:52:57,270
It's going to take some skittles as that dork Todd likes to put it.

915
03:52:58,309 --> 03:53:08,809
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, my dork. Beat Jordan's best lap. This arrow is not helping me.

916
03:53:20,709 --> 03:53:51,290
It counts. Hit it.

917
03:53:58,860 --> 03:54:02,120
You want to save? Yes.

918
03:54:05,079 --> 03:54:10,790
SpongeBob driving test. What's wrong with me?

919
03:54:11,750 --> 03:54:17,739
There you are. Hey, come on. It's two in the afternoon and you're still asleep.

920
03:54:17,739 --> 03:54:24,969
You got to skate the demo at three. You know what demo? The team demo. Come on. I want you

921
03:54:24,969 --> 03:54:29,370
to get the new guy. Yeah, I do. I look like, look, I look like it's Dexter. Dexter character.

922
03:54:30,170 --> 03:54:36,010
You're on the team. It's like Dexter's older cousin. That's cool. I can see how busy you've been.

923
03:54:36,649 --> 03:54:43,540
Oh, you guys know each other? Anyway, why don't you find the rest of the team? They scattered

924
03:54:43,540 --> 03:54:52,040
after the party. I'll see you guys at the demo after I chow down. All right. So yeah,

925
03:54:52,920 --> 03:55:00,069
new friend became enemy. Good thing they're all right here.

926
03:55:07,879 --> 03:55:14,379
Other than you and me, the rest of the guys on the team kind of got lost or wandered off.

927
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:20,180
Mm hmm. You need to round him up. Why distract Todd? Or we're going to have to cancel the demo.

928
03:55:20,899 --> 03:55:26,709
All right, the team members. Do they have an indicator or they're just lying around?

929
03:55:27,590 --> 03:55:50,729
Do they have a green indicator? Good one. What? Yeah, they do have an indicator. Hey, get over here.

930
03:55:51,450 --> 03:56:10,360
You're going to miss the demo, man. Come on. It's going to be some kind of record.

931
03:56:30,629 --> 03:56:34,790
I'm just like skating around. Yeah, I'm just having fun. I shouldn't be doing that. I need

932
03:56:34,790 --> 03:56:58,790
to go find these guys. No fun allowed. Get up there.

933
03:57:06,500 --> 03:57:11,780
I got to go up and around this whole thing. Oh, shit. Do I actually have to do this?

934
03:57:14,979 --> 03:57:17,780
Am I going to climb it? I don't think I can climb it anywhere.

935
03:57:23,750 --> 03:57:28,309
You got to grind it. Oh, wait, there's a pipe here.

936
03:57:28,309 --> 03:57:31,190
I know you want to make move, my son. You best take a second look.

937
03:57:31,190 --> 03:57:32,069
You're going to get some super here.

938
03:57:38,360 --> 03:57:39,000
I don't think it's going to be enough.

939
03:57:49,299 --> 03:57:53,620
I got to go the other way. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Get up. All right, I got it.

940
03:57:53,620 --> 03:58:01,370
I'm trying to snatch it after the laughter won't cease from the comparison. I dare you, son.

941
03:58:01,370 --> 03:58:01,770
Stupid.

942
03:58:20,250 --> 03:58:20,889
Stop having fun.

943
03:58:20,889 --> 03:58:52,040
All right. Let me get this guy first. Oh, I went by him.

944
03:58:53,270 --> 03:58:59,909
Blame, blame, blame, blame, blame, dude, blame, blame.

945
03:58:59,989 --> 03:59:04,100
Blame.

946
03:59:49,690 --> 04:00:00,309
I mean, this is pretty sick. I have to do it.

947
04:00:00,950 --> 04:00:10,309
All right.

948
04:00:20,950 --> 04:00:28,309
OK, I need three more.

949
04:00:31,110 --> 04:00:33,110
I'm here. I think I'll find you.

950
04:00:48,940 --> 04:00:49,819
Somebody up here, right?

951
04:01:00,760 --> 04:01:01,319
Where are you?

952
04:01:01,319 --> 04:01:16,469
No, but again, where are you?

953
04:01:25,670 --> 04:01:26,469
No.

954
04:01:26,469 --> 04:01:38,760
Damn it. Where are these other three people?

955
04:01:39,399 --> 04:01:44,940
You in here?

956
04:01:45,659 --> 04:01:55,700
No, nobody in here. I'm not going to do it.

957
04:02:00,809 --> 04:02:01,530
Somebody there.

958
04:02:03,209 --> 04:02:06,870
That's only one. You're also a fucking mess.

959
04:02:07,510 --> 04:02:14,219
All right. I remember this one. Sorry.

960
04:02:19,139 --> 04:02:24,920
Apparently, I got them. These other two hidden fucking people.

961
04:02:25,879 --> 04:02:29,049
All right. Come on. One more. One more.

962
04:02:29,049 --> 04:02:31,290
Where's the last one? I need one more guy.

963
04:02:31,290 --> 04:02:43,770
Come on. 13 seconds. Oh, my God.

964
04:02:54,100 --> 04:02:55,620
I never found this guy.

965
04:02:56,500 --> 04:02:59,989
Hide in a bush. All right. Let's go.

966
04:03:00,709 --> 04:03:24,520
Let's get him. I did find him, though.

967
04:03:24,520 --> 04:03:26,120
That's true. I did. I did find him.

968
04:03:27,909 --> 04:03:30,549
Two. Three is that way.

969
04:03:31,510 --> 04:03:38,250
Got to get up here and grind it.

970
04:03:38,969 --> 04:03:40,680
It's not what I wanted to do.

971
04:03:41,559 --> 04:03:43,639
What are you, a dumb person?

972
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:59,620
Okay. Two more.

973
04:04:03,059 --> 04:04:05,299
There was somebody in this building over here.

974
04:04:08,219 --> 04:04:12,360
Stop. And where is the other one?

975
04:04:13,719 --> 04:04:15,319
I got three minutes at most to find him.

976
04:04:16,680 --> 04:04:18,760
All right. Any doctors in chat?

977
04:04:19,639 --> 04:04:20,840
Are there any doctors in here?

978
04:04:22,040 --> 04:04:28,360
All right. What does it mean when my entire face is itchy?

979
04:04:29,159 --> 04:04:32,229
They never stop. And I don't have any allergies.

980
04:04:32,229 --> 04:04:32,790
What does that mean?

981
04:04:33,590 --> 04:04:44,780
Every three to four minutes, I have an itchy spot somewhere on my face.

982
04:04:45,739 --> 04:04:51,690
What does that mean? My man's dry.

983
04:04:51,690 --> 04:04:53,450
No, no, no. No, I'm not a moisturizer.

984
04:04:53,450 --> 04:04:55,620
Looks like we got our cart back.

985
04:04:55,620 --> 04:04:58,340
And there's some free skateboards on the back.

986
04:04:58,340 --> 04:05:03,860
How nice of you punks to leave these here for us after you stole our cart in the first place.

987
04:05:04,500 --> 04:05:05,540
Have a nice day.

988
04:05:06,420 --> 04:05:10,420
What do we do?

989
04:05:11,059 --> 04:05:12,840
Just hitch for 60 seconds.

990
04:05:17,000 --> 04:05:22,040
Oh, that doesn't seem fair.

991
04:05:23,159 --> 04:05:44,889
All right. It's like Temple Run.

992
04:05:45,690 --> 04:06:06,709
That hurt. Mobile gaming streamer.

993
04:06:06,709 --> 04:06:08,549
And then I played Temple Run maybe once.

994
04:06:09,850 --> 04:06:11,770
But that's what this mechanic is.

995
04:06:13,290 --> 04:06:16,500
This is not even me doing this.

996
04:06:17,780 --> 04:06:20,579
This guy's just running over everybody he's at work with.

997
04:06:20,579 --> 04:06:22,180
No, don't. I'm so close.

998
04:06:22,180 --> 04:06:22,899
Just get over here.

999
04:06:23,860 --> 04:06:28,299
Come here.

1000
04:06:36,659 --> 04:06:40,180
No, stop. Wait, wait for me.

1001
04:06:48,469 --> 04:06:50,709
What was that move? What was that guy doing?

1002
04:06:51,510 --> 04:06:52,709
Come on. I'm so close.

1003
04:06:53,510 --> 04:07:05,590
My God. I can't believe it.

1004
04:07:05,590 --> 04:07:39,799
All right. That was stupid.

1005
04:07:39,799 --> 04:07:41,239
I'm going so fast right now.

1006
04:07:54,360 --> 04:07:57,000
You got to pay attention to the bar and the ring.

1007
04:07:59,959 --> 04:08:13,899
I'll give you fucking 60 bucks if you can beat this first try.

1008
04:08:13,899 --> 04:08:14,540
Right, Gerber?

1009
04:08:14,540 --> 04:08:18,120
No. Will you really?

1010
04:08:18,680 --> 04:08:23,879
Nope. I'm just going to throw up a ham sandwich on my keyboard or something.

1011
04:08:36,709 --> 04:08:58,040
Get it. Don't let go.

1012
04:09:02,809 --> 04:09:07,979
Okay. It's coming down here, right?

1013
04:09:08,620 --> 04:09:24,780
Okay. View goals. The only public one or two left, right?

1014
04:09:24,780 --> 04:09:27,180
Breeze the crowd. Find more kids.

1015
04:09:40,090 --> 04:09:43,450
I love the Sonic the Hedgehog actor.

1016
04:09:44,409 --> 04:09:45,049
That people do.

1017
04:09:46,170 --> 04:09:59,100
That'll itch my fucking like rotten face.

1018
04:10:01,829 --> 04:10:14,540
Ready? Three, two, one. Let's go.

1019
04:10:30,280 --> 04:10:32,520
It's time for you guys. It's time for you to pay.

1020
04:10:33,159 --> 04:10:37,209
Anyway, if you're as good as they say you are,

1021
04:10:37,209 --> 04:10:40,090
then do whatever grind I tell you to up on that raised bar.

1022
04:10:41,049 --> 04:10:42,969
Sure. Grind the bar.

1023
04:10:47,930 --> 04:10:50,250
Nosebleed. A double nosebleed.

1024
04:10:51,129 --> 04:11:02,969
All right, let's do it. Can I switch it up?

1025
04:11:04,090 --> 04:11:11,319
Ooh. 50-50. Nice.

1026
04:11:13,819 --> 04:11:15,739
Re-50-50 is going to noseblunt.

1027
04:11:16,459 --> 04:11:26,819
He's instantly just retrying every single failure.

1028
04:11:26,819 --> 04:11:29,860
Yeah, that's what you do.

1029
04:11:31,059 --> 04:11:32,340
I thought you got it.

1030
04:11:32,340 --> 04:11:35,459
You got it because it's not clean in your brain and you don't want to do it.

1031
04:11:37,590 --> 04:11:40,549
Like for instance, I would have just restarted right there,

1032
04:11:40,549 --> 04:11:41,909
but I might still be able to do it.

1033
04:12:06,309 --> 04:12:07,110
Go faster.

1034
04:12:07,110 --> 04:12:21,139
Restart Randy. Restart Randy.

1035
04:12:24,579 --> 04:12:26,659
Faster, faster. I'm going as fast as I can.

1036
04:12:28,100 --> 04:12:30,739
How is that not fucking Xbox 360 controller?

1037
04:12:37,780 --> 04:12:55,370
I got it.

1038
04:13:31,319 --> 04:13:31,959
Nose brine.

1039
04:13:32,760 --> 04:13:34,360
Good. Good RNG.

1040
04:13:40,299 --> 04:13:40,780
Pop-pop.

1041
04:13:44,500 --> 04:13:45,219
Good RNG.

1042
04:13:47,379 --> 04:13:52,620
Look at that RNG. It's like playing Tetris.

1043
04:14:17,739 --> 04:14:18,459
I'll try.

1044
04:14:20,059 --> 04:14:22,459
All right, reporter. Take a look at this one.

1045
04:14:23,100 --> 04:14:25,100
Get a huge score to impress the media.

1046
04:14:43,290 --> 04:14:51,530
Oh, what? You bought that in one combo?

1047
04:14:51,530 --> 04:14:52,250
Is that what you wanted?

1048
04:15:04,260 --> 04:15:06,500
Get special and press just before the lip.

1049
04:15:07,139 --> 04:15:34,549
All right, what do you want to do?

1050
04:15:35,829 --> 04:15:41,819
Press right just before lipping on the stage lights.

1051
04:15:51,030 --> 04:15:53,719
Is that it? I don't think that's right.

1052
04:15:53,799 --> 04:16:02,520
All right, right, right, yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

1053
04:16:18,819 --> 04:16:22,139
Turbo walk. I did it right.

1054
04:16:22,940 --> 04:16:24,569
Does that count?

1055
04:16:44,299 --> 04:16:44,700
There you go.

1056
04:16:51,100 --> 04:16:51,899
Going to Hawaii.

1057
04:16:55,739 --> 04:17:03,260
Can you believe it? Hawaii. You must be stoked.

1058
04:17:03,260 --> 04:17:05,500
The team usually doesn't bring hams on a trip this big.

1059
04:17:06,219 --> 04:17:09,180
And those sketches are awesome. Did you draw them?

1060
04:17:09,180 --> 04:17:12,620
No, some artists did. They're the graphics for my new pro model.

1061
04:17:14,389 --> 04:17:17,270
Hey, how long were you on the team before you turned pro?

1062
04:17:17,829 --> 04:17:21,989
About a year. I just threw down a couple of hammers for the last video

1063
04:17:21,989 --> 04:17:25,110
and the response was so crazy. They gave me a pro board.

1064
04:17:26,149 --> 04:17:29,350
Who knows? Do the same. Maybe they'll turn you pro in a few years.

1065
04:17:29,590 --> 04:17:30,950
What's wrong with your character?

1066
04:17:32,469 --> 04:17:34,229
It's a weird glitch that happens in the game sometimes.

1067
04:17:34,229 --> 04:17:35,510
This is original Xbox, by the way.

1068
04:17:36,709 --> 04:17:40,549
If you get more than two million points in one combo,

1069
04:17:40,549 --> 04:17:43,430
the game can kind of fuck up and when it loads the actual combo,

1070
04:17:43,430 --> 04:17:45,510
all right, you can mess up your character and shit.

1071
04:17:45,510 --> 04:17:48,549
We paid for your trip to Hawaii. Getting sick footage is your job.

1072
04:17:51,190 --> 04:17:54,549
Then we're going to premiere our video in Vancouver at the Slam City Jam.

1073
04:17:54,549 --> 04:17:57,110
So don't half ass it. We hook up in three days.

1074
04:18:01,129 --> 04:18:14,469
I need a rabbit.

1075
04:18:14,469 --> 04:18:18,229
Nothing says aloha like getting laid. Collect five lays.

1076
04:18:19,190 --> 04:18:38,600
Five lays. Let's get it. Sucks. I wonder if it's failed.

1077
04:18:40,280 --> 04:19:08,709
Consoles ever. Like the 360. All right, two more down here.

1078
04:19:09,829 --> 04:19:37,959
I took a lot from me to not restart. There's only one more after this.

1079
04:20:10,969 --> 04:20:34,170
Over here is the one I didn't get. Didn't get it. Too hard.

1080
04:20:34,170 --> 04:20:45,079
Inside that bar. Restart Robert.

1081
04:20:46,229 --> 04:20:48,709
Restart Andy. Restart Randy.

1082
04:20:49,750 --> 04:20:55,879
This is Tony Hawk. If you are not one thousand percent happy

1083
04:20:55,879 --> 04:20:58,520
every tenth of a second, you restart the mission.

1084
04:20:58,520 --> 04:21:01,879
Good footage of destruction. Pineapples explode real nice.

1085
04:21:01,879 --> 04:21:05,079
Let's see a smash five pineapple stance. Smash five pineapples.

1086
04:21:06,280 --> 04:21:27,190
Apparently it wasn't enough. Can't wait.

1087
04:21:28,969 --> 04:21:47,819
Popping in here. What else is here?

1088
04:21:55,030 --> 04:21:58,229
Jump into Tiki. Tiki. Go to the Tiki.

1089
04:22:10,920 --> 04:22:15,030
Jump in Tiki. Where is it?

1090
04:22:39,829 --> 04:22:44,629
Hey, first big trip. Paradise is pretty sweet until you smash your face on a banyan tree.

1091
04:22:45,670 --> 04:22:49,750
Remember, you're here to skate, not to play official bikini inspector.

1092
04:22:49,750 --> 04:22:51,190
Look, why don't you just show me what you got?

1093
04:22:52,709 --> 04:22:55,190
Get special, then do a crook's dark slide grind.

1094
04:22:55,190 --> 04:22:57,030
Lock on to it long enough to show me you got it.

1095
04:22:57,989 --> 04:23:24,100
I say it every time I stop talking. I even do that.

1096
04:23:24,979 --> 04:23:30,020
I intentionally jumped off the board and tried to neck myself on the ground.

1097
04:23:31,139 --> 04:23:32,180
You can't even do that.

1098
04:23:41,450 --> 04:23:42,569
All right, what does he want me to do?

1099
04:23:43,530 --> 04:23:46,729
Crook's dark slide. Hold it long enough so I know you're good.

1100
04:23:47,770 --> 04:24:02,889
You all right? That wasn't long enough?

1101
04:24:03,690 --> 04:24:07,049
What are you doing?

1102
04:24:08,090 --> 04:24:11,049
What are you doing? Stop moving me around.

1103
04:24:34,149 --> 04:24:38,469
Okay, here we go. Show me a crook's dark slide.

1104
04:24:42,760 --> 04:24:44,360
All right, I have to hold it for seven seconds.

1105
04:24:44,360 --> 04:24:46,360
Where the hell am I going to do it for seven seconds?

1106
04:24:49,139 --> 04:24:50,340
How am I going to do it for that long?

1107
04:24:50,979 --> 04:24:57,379
It's going to go very slow. Come on.

1108
04:24:57,379 --> 04:24:59,299
Three, two, one.

1109
04:25:08,329 --> 04:25:09,129
Oh, I did it.

1110
04:25:11,370 --> 04:25:11,930
Restart ready.

1111
04:25:16,329 --> 04:25:18,250
Restart, Randy. That's me.

1112
04:25:18,250 --> 04:25:19,850
Hey, by the way, anybody just open the screen?

1113
04:25:27,020 --> 04:25:30,059
There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there.

1114
04:25:30,059 --> 04:25:30,379
Where?

1115
04:25:34,819 --> 04:25:35,540
What do you want me to do?

1116
04:25:41,659 --> 04:25:43,819
Other way, other way, other way.

1117
04:25:45,420 --> 04:25:49,500
I am literally screaming at my fucking monitor.

1118
04:25:49,579 --> 04:25:49,899
Where?

1119
04:25:51,260 --> 04:25:55,420
God, there, right fucking there.

1120
04:25:55,420 --> 04:25:57,420
Oh, my God, I'm screaming.

1121
04:25:57,420 --> 04:26:00,860
I'm grabbing my TV and screaming at it.

1122
04:26:40,260 --> 04:26:41,379
Oh, that was crazy.

1123
04:26:43,139 --> 04:26:45,540
Oh, no, it's bugleberry.

1124
04:26:46,819 --> 04:26:56,360
Missed it.

1125
04:26:56,360 --> 04:26:57,639
I don't even know what I was supposed to be doing.

1126
04:26:58,840 --> 04:26:59,479
I'll try it again.

1127
04:27:23,639 --> 04:27:24,500
Okay, here we go.

1128
04:27:31,370 --> 04:27:34,340
No, I don't.

1129
04:27:41,430 --> 04:27:42,549
That's not me doing the voice.

1130
04:27:42,549 --> 04:27:43,110
It doesn't count.

1131
04:27:48,340 --> 04:27:49,700
Right there, right there.

1132
04:27:49,700 --> 04:27:51,299
I know I'm trying to.

1133
04:27:51,299 --> 04:27:53,299
There's like a videotape or something I can grab.

1134
04:27:54,020 --> 04:27:57,659
I don't think my oddly is good enough to get it.

1135
04:27:57,659 --> 04:27:58,159
Try it again.

1136
04:27:58,940 --> 04:28:06,790
Old school icon.

1137
04:28:06,790 --> 04:28:07,350
Congratulations.

1138
04:28:07,350 --> 04:28:08,870
You've unlocked an old school level.

1139
04:28:08,870 --> 04:28:10,950
Venice from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.

1140
04:28:12,149 --> 04:28:22,120
Okay, I can't restart.

1141
04:28:25,079 --> 04:28:25,719
Wedding guest.

1142
04:28:26,360 --> 04:28:29,739
There are lots of people getting married around here.

1143
04:28:29,739 --> 04:28:33,579
Why don't you try to get some footage with four sets of brides and grooms?

1144
04:28:33,579 --> 04:28:35,579
Perform the trick and I'll take the shot.

1145
04:28:37,559 --> 04:28:38,680
Some wedding footage?

1146
04:28:39,559 --> 04:28:40,840
But I have to do a kick flip.

1147
04:28:40,840 --> 04:28:44,040
Why would you want to kick flip somebody doing a kick flip behind your wedding photo?

1148
04:28:46,440 --> 04:28:59,799
This is the shit that you tell the guy to photoshop out of the frame.

1149
04:29:16,860 --> 04:29:17,500
Wrong couple.

1150
04:29:19,819 --> 04:29:20,139
What?

1151
04:29:20,139 --> 04:29:21,340
He's aiming camera over here.

1152
04:29:22,860 --> 04:29:27,500
Next couple?

1153
04:29:52,620 --> 04:29:53,340
Yeah, right.

1154
04:29:53,979 --> 04:29:54,700
That's so stupid.

1155
04:30:00,700 --> 04:30:04,780
What do they want?

1156
04:30:04,780 --> 04:30:06,139
Impossible.

1157
04:30:12,840 --> 04:30:24,200
Get it?

1158
04:30:31,079 --> 04:30:42,200
Be discreet.

1159
04:31:08,149 --> 04:31:09,510
I drowned in the pool.

1160
04:31:09,510 --> 04:31:21,020
Okay, where's this other couple?

1161
04:31:22,059 --> 04:31:22,889
From here?

1162
04:31:23,770 --> 04:31:28,860
Where's this other couple?

1163
04:31:28,860 --> 04:31:29,659
Fucking Xbox.

1164
04:31:29,659 --> 04:31:30,379
Fucking stupid.

1165
04:31:30,379 --> 04:31:31,579
Fucking shittiest console.

1166
04:31:31,579 --> 04:31:32,299
Fucking Xbox.

1167
04:31:32,299 --> 04:31:33,020
Fucking stupid.

1168
04:31:33,819 --> 04:31:35,420
Where's the other couple?

1169
04:31:48,229 --> 04:31:50,149
Getting old console bumping and stuff.

1170
04:31:50,149 --> 04:31:51,110
Fucking shitty thing.

1171
04:31:52,469 --> 04:32:13,590
Some of you new viewers.

1172
04:32:14,389 --> 04:32:17,270
I don't know what I'm doing right there, but some of you old viewers know.

1173
04:32:20,100 --> 04:32:21,459
Come on, where's the last couple?

1174
04:32:28,219 --> 04:32:28,940
What?

1175
04:32:28,940 --> 04:32:30,069
I don't have a special.

1176
04:32:30,069 --> 04:32:30,950
Why is that even possible?

1177
04:32:31,750 --> 04:33:19,430
Okay, where's the last couple?

1178
04:33:20,310 --> 04:33:21,270
This other one's over here.

1179
04:33:22,470 --> 04:33:24,439
There's one where?

1180
04:33:25,619 --> 04:33:25,860
Where?

1181
04:33:26,840 --> 04:33:27,319
Right here.

1182
04:33:29,110 --> 04:33:30,229
Where's the last one?

1183
04:33:31,110 --> 04:33:32,759
Where?

1184
04:33:35,700 --> 04:33:36,020
There.

1185
04:33:37,110 --> 04:33:37,830
Right there.

1186
04:33:37,830 --> 04:33:38,709
Where's the last one?

1187
04:33:40,840 --> 04:33:41,560
In the teak.

1188
04:33:41,560 --> 04:33:42,840
Oh, that would be rude.

1189
04:33:42,840 --> 04:33:45,349
Seriously.

1190
04:33:45,349 --> 04:33:46,069
Where the hell are they?

1191
04:33:50,279 --> 04:33:50,840
Up, are they?

1192
04:33:51,880 --> 04:34:29,689
Come on.

1193
04:34:29,689 --> 04:34:31,209
Sometimes you have to just be calm down.

1194
04:34:31,209 --> 04:34:32,009
Just calm down.

1195
04:34:32,009 --> 04:34:34,409
First wall plant the vending machine three times.

1196
04:34:35,209 --> 04:34:37,689
Come on.

1197
04:34:37,689 --> 04:34:40,330
Let me adjust my, uh, my fucking bionic boomer vest.

1198
04:34:41,290 --> 04:34:50,250
Come on, comfortable?

1199
04:34:51,529 --> 04:34:53,689
All right, first wall plant the vending machines three times.

1200
04:34:56,330 --> 04:35:01,669
This is some.

1201
04:35:02,310 --> 04:35:06,950
This is some stupid secret how to get to the DLC in Bloodborne or Dark Souls.

1202
04:35:06,950 --> 04:35:07,669
Here it comes.

1203
04:35:20,180 --> 04:35:23,540
Now, acid drop from that platform up there into the pool.

1204
04:35:23,540 --> 04:35:28,020
I bet it'll make a big enough splash to make the security guard drop his candy bar into the pool.

1205
04:35:28,020 --> 04:35:28,659
Acid drop.

1206
04:35:28,659 --> 04:35:29,540
Yeah, acid drop.

1207
04:35:29,540 --> 04:35:31,139
Jump out over the pool and press.

1208
04:35:32,259 --> 04:35:32,740
Press what?

1209
04:35:34,099 --> 04:35:35,380
Press skeezo, press what?

1210
04:35:36,419 --> 04:35:39,529
Is he all right?

1211
04:36:14,490 --> 04:36:26,330
Um, acid drop.

1212
04:36:26,330 --> 04:36:39,110
Jump out over the pool and press L and R for two ladders.

1213
04:36:39,110 --> 04:36:42,759
Okay, but I can't even get over there.

1214
04:36:49,610 --> 04:36:50,009
All right.

1215
04:36:50,009 --> 04:36:52,409
This so fucking finicky being on this legend.

1216
04:36:58,330 --> 04:37:21,369
What?

1217
04:37:26,250 --> 04:37:39,740
All that just to throw a candy bar on the pool.

1218
04:37:39,900 --> 04:37:44,680
I think we're at the, uh, check out this clip from wallows.

1219
04:37:47,529 --> 04:37:49,819
Whoa, and that's some heavy footage.

1220
04:37:50,540 --> 04:37:52,220
What you got going?

1221
04:37:52,220 --> 04:37:55,500
Um, I have some secret spot I just found.

1222
04:37:55,500 --> 04:37:56,540
It's pretty gnarly.

1223
04:37:56,540 --> 04:37:57,819
I'm going to shoot it later today.

1224
04:37:58,779 --> 04:37:59,659
That's cool.

1225
04:37:59,659 --> 04:38:01,259
Give me a ring if you need help shooting it.

1226
04:38:01,259 --> 04:38:05,740
It'd be like old this guy middle in an animorph into a root vegetable.

1227
04:38:07,029 --> 04:38:09,669
I think that's the actual description of what it is.

1228
04:38:10,709 --> 04:38:25,180
Lots of places on the island to get some good lip trick.

1229
04:38:26,299 --> 04:38:28,220
Find the four lip trick spots.

1230
04:38:28,220 --> 04:38:28,779
Lip trick.

1231
04:38:29,500 --> 04:38:32,700
And hold a lip trick at each spot long enough for me to get some footage.

1232
04:38:42,580 --> 04:38:43,860
Where's the lip trick up here?

1233
04:38:45,060 --> 04:38:47,369
Up there.

1234
04:38:56,659 --> 04:38:57,939
Is there a half pipe here?

1235
04:38:59,060 --> 04:39:02,169
This ain't a half pipe, it is.

1236
04:39:16,279 --> 04:39:23,099
I gotta go.

1237
04:39:23,819 --> 04:39:25,770
Everything's closed up.

1238
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:37,080
Good.

1239
04:39:37,639 --> 04:39:38,360
Thank you.

1240
04:39:40,380 --> 04:39:43,659
That one is one over here somewhere that I saw right there.

1241
04:39:43,659 --> 04:39:51,580
Do a Russian bonus or riot.

1242
04:39:52,939 --> 04:39:56,259
There, I did a.

1243
04:39:58,119 --> 04:39:58,520
Invert.

1244
04:39:59,400 --> 04:40:01,909
Be happy.

1245
04:40:04,090 --> 04:40:04,729
No, you know what?

1246
04:40:04,729 --> 04:40:05,130
You know what?

1247
04:40:05,130 --> 04:40:06,250
No, you know, ban that guy.

1248
04:40:06,889 --> 04:40:07,610
Ban that person.

1249
04:40:08,330 --> 04:40:09,450
Unbelievable.

1250
04:40:09,450 --> 04:40:22,569
We don't take requests on this channel and I'm gonna put my foot down on that.

1251
04:40:31,849 --> 04:40:33,130
No, I do the lip trick.

1252
04:40:34,330 --> 04:40:38,950
Quick, somebody redeem a wink.

1253
04:40:39,830 --> 04:40:41,959
Here it is.

1254
04:40:45,880 --> 04:40:46,759
Nice.

1255
04:40:48,279 --> 04:40:50,409
How long can I hold a manual for?

1256
04:40:50,409 --> 04:40:52,169
I need to hold it for like 10 seconds.

1257
04:40:53,770 --> 04:41:04,069
There it is.

1258
04:41:04,069 --> 04:41:04,549
15.

1259
04:41:07,020 --> 04:41:11,540
Oh, everybody in the room just ran.

1260
04:41:11,540 --> 04:41:30,250
Ooh, the annual plus one to even get 20.

1261
04:41:45,540 --> 04:41:46,259
How long was that?

1262
04:41:47,060 --> 04:41:55,290
God, manualing is free.

1263
04:41:56,810 --> 04:41:59,689
This ditch here is called off the walls.

1264
04:41:59,689 --> 04:42:01,450
Manual to the end in one combo.

1265
04:42:01,450 --> 04:42:04,090
To make it harder, do a handstand while you're at it.

1266
04:42:05,049 --> 04:42:06,090
I know what it's gonna be.

1267
04:42:09,930 --> 04:42:11,689
The last one got redeemed an hour ago.

1268
04:42:11,689 --> 04:42:12,250
I can see it.

1269
04:42:13,369 --> 04:42:22,490
All right, we want to do manual down off the wall.

1270
04:42:25,049 --> 04:42:25,529
Hold on.

1271
04:42:25,529 --> 04:42:27,290
Manual off the wall and do a handstand.

1272
04:42:29,529 --> 04:42:39,259
My hands got sucked in.

1273
04:42:53,720 --> 04:42:54,119
Not it?

1274
04:42:54,759 --> 04:42:55,959
Manual down off the wall.

1275
04:43:04,759 --> 04:43:07,240
Manual down off the walls and do a handstand.

1276
04:43:07,240 --> 04:43:08,200
Should I bounce off the wall?

1277
04:43:08,840 --> 04:43:09,479
Real wink.

1278
04:43:10,439 --> 04:43:33,020
What do I need to hold it for?

1279
04:43:33,020 --> 04:43:41,500
Do the whole thing or something?

1280
04:43:41,500 --> 04:43:55,750
Manual down off the wall.

1281
04:43:55,750 --> 04:43:56,549
Down?

1282
04:43:56,549 --> 04:44:09,799
Maybe it wants to be like actually dropped down.

1283
04:44:11,159 --> 04:44:19,610
Not it?

1284
04:44:20,650 --> 04:44:49,189
Do I have to make it the entire way?

1285
04:44:50,150 --> 04:44:54,310
Am I gonna run out of steam here and not even touch the wall?

1286
04:44:55,189 --> 04:44:59,610
Oh, and I did it.

1287
04:45:01,770 --> 04:45:02,650
That was weird, okay?

1288
04:45:04,009 --> 04:45:10,119
I did well.

1289
04:45:11,880 --> 04:45:14,919
Impress the girls.

1290
04:45:17,500 --> 04:45:19,900
Ladies love the big combos.

1291
04:45:20,619 --> 04:45:25,979
See if you can impress three groups of bikini girls by landing big combos in front of each one.

1292
04:45:26,540 --> 04:45:26,939
All right.

1293
04:45:35,900 --> 04:45:36,700
No, I gotta go.

1294
04:45:37,500 --> 04:45:39,099
I've got more people to impress.

1295
04:45:40,310 --> 04:45:41,430
But I will, ladies.

1296
04:45:42,229 --> 04:45:43,349
I'll leave you with it.

1297
04:45:45,979 --> 04:46:12,919
What was that?

1298
04:46:12,919 --> 04:46:13,880
I put it between my legs.

1299
04:46:50,540 --> 04:46:52,540
Did that not count?

1300
04:47:03,099 --> 04:47:03,340
No.

1301
04:47:04,459 --> 04:47:17,189
All right, ladies.

1302
04:47:17,830 --> 04:47:18,549
Get away.

1303
04:47:19,450 --> 04:47:20,090
Don't restart.

1304
04:47:45,770 --> 04:47:46,490
I want to impress it.

1305
04:48:07,319 --> 04:48:07,959
66.

1306
04:48:08,840 --> 04:48:24,340
There it is.

1307
04:48:25,139 --> 04:48:25,619
All right.

1308
04:48:25,619 --> 04:48:26,419
Make it nice and easy.

1309
04:48:27,380 --> 04:48:30,259
Let's get out of this hole.

1310
04:48:32,779 --> 04:48:33,259
All right.

1311
04:48:33,259 --> 04:48:33,659
You know what?

1312
04:48:33,659 --> 04:48:34,860
I'm just gonna manual in front of you guys.

1313
04:48:35,500 --> 04:48:37,500
Because this is, I, here we go.

1314
04:48:37,500 --> 04:48:37,819
Ready?

1315
04:49:11,430 --> 04:49:11,909
Damn it.

1316
04:49:19,450 --> 04:49:21,450
Your combos are so big.

1317
04:49:35,750 --> 04:49:37,750
Your combos are so big.

1318
04:49:38,709 --> 04:49:43,740
Here we go.

1319
04:49:44,700 --> 04:49:47,560
I almost just restarted.

1320
04:49:57,720 --> 04:50:05,099
I thought she was T-posing.

1321
04:50:05,099 --> 04:50:05,819
No, dancing.

1322
04:50:06,779 --> 04:50:08,659
Mahalo.

1323
04:50:08,659 --> 04:50:11,299
Welcome to the beautiful island of Hawaii.

1324
04:50:11,299 --> 04:50:13,060
Please join our skate competition.

1325
04:50:16,580 --> 04:50:17,779
Metal competition?

1326
04:50:18,740 --> 04:50:19,779
I didn't know I was starting.

1327
04:50:20,740 --> 04:50:32,619
That was a big one.

1328
04:50:32,619 --> 04:50:41,659
Here we go.

1329
04:50:57,270 --> 04:50:59,909
That's what we call saving at the end.

1330
04:51:44,150 --> 04:51:45,669
I'm trying so hard.

1331
04:51:45,669 --> 04:51:57,060
Fucking way.

1332
04:51:58,139 --> 04:52:00,779
This is skateboarding competition, you fucking idiots.

1333
04:52:01,659 --> 04:52:13,939
Four.

1334
04:52:13,939 --> 04:52:21,659
Am I just standing in the middle of the half pipe?

1335
04:52:22,540 --> 04:52:23,580
Having a conversation?

1336
04:52:24,299 --> 04:52:25,419
What is wrong with you guys?

1337
04:52:27,580 --> 04:52:28,619
I can't restart that.

1338
04:52:45,299 --> 04:52:45,860
Bullvine.

1339
04:52:45,860 --> 04:52:46,979
Bullvine Ernie.

1340
04:52:46,979 --> 04:52:47,939
Or Germer Rumble.

1341
04:52:48,659 --> 04:52:51,750
What are the goals?

1342
04:52:51,750 --> 04:52:53,080
What did I just do?

1343
04:52:53,080 --> 04:52:53,799
No.

1344
04:52:53,799 --> 04:52:54,439
View goals.

1345
04:52:56,950 --> 04:52:58,310
Wallows combo balls.

1346
04:53:00,200 --> 04:53:01,479
Or high lines.

1347
04:53:03,159 --> 04:53:04,279
Kill wallows.

1348
04:53:11,799 --> 04:53:15,799
You'll have to top trick on the houses, fences, and balconies here in wallows.

1349
04:53:34,810 --> 04:53:35,369
More air.

1350
04:53:52,439 --> 04:53:57,959
Come on.

1351
04:53:57,959 --> 04:53:58,439
Get up there.

1352
04:53:59,000 --> 04:54:33,340
It's out of bounds.

1353
04:54:34,139 --> 04:54:47,130
It's like trying to get on the fence.

1354
04:54:48,389 --> 04:54:48,950
There we go.

1355
04:54:49,669 --> 04:55:06,709
That would have been like 200,000.

1356
04:55:07,349 --> 04:55:25,380
Five.

1357
04:55:25,380 --> 04:55:40,700
Already got this one.

1358
04:55:45,130 --> 04:55:50,500
I'm trying to get on the fences and the houses, but it's hard to do it too.

1359
04:55:50,500 --> 04:55:52,500
What the fuck is wrong with this?

1360
04:55:53,380 --> 04:55:53,860
Do it again.

1361
04:55:54,580 --> 04:56:27,540
Yeah, okay.

1362
04:56:27,540 --> 04:56:28,659
I got Ollie too.

1363
04:56:36,279 --> 04:56:36,759
Four more.

1364
04:56:36,759 --> 04:56:37,560
What have I not done?

1365
04:56:37,560 --> 04:56:38,040
Which house?

1366
04:56:39,319 --> 04:56:40,380
All right.

1367
04:56:40,380 --> 04:56:41,099
There's a...

1368
04:56:41,099 --> 04:56:41,740
It's up here.

1369
04:56:42,700 --> 04:56:44,389
Let me go back this way.

1370
04:56:44,389 --> 04:56:47,720
Nope.

1371
04:56:47,720 --> 04:56:48,040
Ah.

1372
04:56:48,599 --> 04:56:50,939
I'm gonna go five.

1373
04:56:51,740 --> 04:56:57,700
Did that count?

1374
04:56:57,700 --> 04:56:58,200
Yeah.

1375
04:56:59,139 --> 04:57:00,099
What am I even on?

1376
04:57:13,340 --> 04:57:13,840
Shit.

1377
04:57:14,299 --> 04:57:20,810
I'm trying to find a way to...

1378
04:57:20,810 --> 04:57:21,770
Like while you turn...

1379
04:57:21,770 --> 04:57:23,529
Like I'm trying to get on the ledge here.

1380
04:57:23,529 --> 04:57:24,650
There we go.

1381
04:57:24,650 --> 04:57:25,639
That's it.

1382
04:57:26,740 --> 04:57:28,360
One more.

1383
04:57:28,360 --> 04:57:29,560
What piece of fence did I not touch?

1384
04:57:32,060 --> 04:57:33,580
Fence or a piece of a house or something?

1385
04:57:34,700 --> 04:57:35,099
Come on.

1386
04:57:36,139 --> 04:57:38,409
Oh, come on.

1387
04:57:41,799 --> 04:57:42,360
Come on.

1388
04:57:42,360 --> 04:57:42,860
Anything.

1389
04:57:45,540 --> 04:57:46,500
Literally anything.

1390
04:57:46,500 --> 04:57:47,000
A house.

1391
04:57:50,470 --> 04:57:50,970
There it is.

1392
04:57:51,430 --> 04:57:51,930
End it.

1393
04:58:14,040 --> 04:58:15,159
Dude's fucking naked.

1394
04:58:16,500 --> 04:58:16,979
Big bits?

1395
04:58:16,979 --> 04:58:18,180
What do you mean big bits?

1396
04:58:18,180 --> 04:58:18,680
Where?

1397
04:58:19,779 --> 04:58:20,659
Oh, Jesus.

1398
04:58:23,639 --> 04:58:27,240
Freakout gave like $150 over the course of like three...

1399
04:58:29,060 --> 04:58:30,180
Five different things.

1400
04:58:30,979 --> 04:58:46,060
What?

1401
04:58:46,279 --> 04:58:46,779
What?

1402
04:58:47,319 --> 04:58:47,819
Why?

1403
04:58:47,880 --> 04:58:48,599
What is this?

1404
04:59:17,509 --> 04:59:21,740
However, the Yanks still had to reply to the Germans.

1405
04:59:21,740 --> 04:59:24,060
Otherwise, they'd be wiped out by the shelling.

1406
04:59:24,060 --> 04:59:26,060
While trying to find proper response to the letter,

1407
04:59:26,060 --> 04:59:31,500
Lieutenant Colonel Kynard said that the McCallum said basically summed up the situation.

1408
04:59:31,500 --> 04:59:34,459
So when the Americans finished their letter and sent to the...

1409
04:59:34,459 --> 04:59:35,500
This is what it said.

1410
04:59:35,500 --> 04:59:36,220
They sent a letter.

1411
04:59:36,220 --> 04:59:37,340
It says to the German commander.

1412
04:59:37,340 --> 04:59:37,740
Nuts.

1413
04:59:37,740 --> 04:59:38,779
The American commander.

1414
04:59:40,220 --> 04:59:42,099
That's nuts, right?

1415
04:59:43,299 --> 04:59:44,659
I love you and all you do for this community.

1416
04:59:44,659 --> 04:59:47,220
But I wanted to ask, is voice acting something you still want to pursue?

1417
04:59:47,220 --> 04:59:48,819
Pursue with your little career.

1418
04:59:56,090 --> 04:59:57,290
My little career?

1419
05:00:00,580 --> 05:00:03,689
I think they...

1420
05:00:03,689 --> 05:00:07,209
I don't think they meant that in a negative way, by the way.

1421
05:00:07,209 --> 05:00:09,849
I've only been in like three or four different productions.

1422
05:00:09,849 --> 05:00:10,729
I think that's what they mean.

1423
05:00:12,330 --> 05:00:15,209
Not like, you're like, hey, dude, your career sucks.

1424
05:00:16,779 --> 05:00:17,659
It was pretty short.

1425
05:00:17,659 --> 05:00:19,180
Yeah, I don't think that's what they mean by that.

1426
05:00:20,939 --> 05:00:22,139
No, this is my focus.

1427
05:00:24,409 --> 05:00:28,810
And I mean, just take a look at the last four days straight.

1428
05:00:28,810 --> 05:00:29,450
Five days straight.

1429
05:00:29,450 --> 05:00:30,409
Like, this is what I do.

1430
05:00:30,970 --> 05:00:32,490
This is my 100% focus.

1431
05:00:33,770 --> 05:00:38,009
This stream, this community, is the priority.

1432
05:00:38,729 --> 05:00:41,619
So it's like, I can't...

1433
05:00:42,340 --> 05:00:43,290
I don't...

1434
05:00:43,290 --> 05:00:44,090
I don't...

1435
05:00:44,090 --> 05:00:48,250
I can't like take time to do auditions and do lines.

1436
05:00:48,250 --> 05:00:52,090
And oh, this script has a viewer character that has 250 lines of dialogue.

1437
05:00:52,090 --> 05:00:52,590
I...

1438
05:00:53,450 --> 05:00:56,009
That's just a ton of time with a director.

1439
05:00:56,009 --> 05:00:58,490
And it's just not something I want to focus on.

1440
05:01:03,450 --> 05:01:06,729
So voice acting is cool.

1441
05:01:06,729 --> 05:01:07,369
It's fun.

1442
05:01:07,369 --> 05:01:08,729
And it's really, really interesting stuff.

1443
05:01:09,770 --> 05:01:11,610
But this is the focus.

1444
05:01:15,509 --> 05:01:18,229
Thanks for your interesting nut message.

1445
05:01:19,270 --> 05:01:21,189
I do appreciate the fact that this time you did not...

1446
05:01:21,830 --> 05:01:23,590
You did not spam a bunch of codes.

1447
05:01:24,310 --> 05:01:25,509
So thank you for that.

1448
05:01:25,509 --> 05:01:27,029
And thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.

1449
05:01:32,569 --> 05:01:34,889
He hates voice acting.

1450
05:01:34,889 --> 05:01:37,830
I want to get onto the roof of the Big Sur hotel.

1451
05:02:03,529 --> 05:02:04,029
Okay.

1452
05:02:04,810 --> 05:02:05,310
Now...

1453
05:02:05,689 --> 05:02:06,189
Now where?

1454
05:02:06,970 --> 05:02:08,799
Over...

1455
05:02:09,759 --> 05:02:12,000
Uh, can I go up?

1456
05:02:13,080 --> 05:02:14,680
Wait, oh god, I gotta get up here.

1457
05:02:15,720 --> 05:02:25,849
Would I ever act in a movie?

1458
05:02:27,560 --> 05:02:28,599
Oh, that's...

1459
05:02:28,599 --> 05:02:29,880
Sorry, wasn't paying attention.

1460
05:02:31,159 --> 05:02:31,659
Uh...

1461
05:02:32,520 --> 05:02:33,020
Yes.

1462
05:02:36,669 --> 05:02:37,229
Yes, I would.

1463
05:02:37,869 --> 05:02:45,900
It'd be a lot of fun.

1464
05:02:45,900 --> 05:02:50,520
Would you act in Spider-Man?

1465
05:02:51,560 --> 05:02:52,439
As, um...

1466
05:02:52,439 --> 05:02:53,560
As what character do you...

1467
05:02:53,560 --> 05:02:54,360
What character do you think?

1468
05:02:55,319 --> 05:02:58,409
I think you would be a good green copy.

1469
05:02:59,450 --> 05:03:10,669
Eric, I found it.

1470
05:03:10,669 --> 05:03:12,669
Get up here and bring the camera.

1471
05:03:12,750 --> 05:03:13,790
As the greedy grinner.

1472
05:03:14,750 --> 05:03:20,009
Can you believe this spot?

1473
05:03:20,729 --> 05:03:24,729
We're about to film somebody die on camera.

1474
05:03:29,520 --> 05:03:30,720
You serious?

1475
05:03:30,720 --> 05:03:31,599
You'll miss your ollie.

1476
05:03:31,599 --> 05:03:34,319
We'll be sending you back to Jersey in a coffee can.

1477
05:03:34,319 --> 05:03:35,840
Todd said he wanted something big.

1478
05:03:36,400 --> 05:03:37,360
This is it.

1479
05:03:37,360 --> 05:03:38,880
Todd said he wanted something big, man.

1480
05:03:38,880 --> 05:03:40,319
I'm gonna jump off of a building.

1481
05:03:41,200 --> 05:03:43,040
Without any safety equipment.

1482
05:03:52,889 --> 05:03:53,930
Now that you're up here,

1483
05:03:53,930 --> 05:03:56,889
why don't you try to gap to the top of the wavy roof hotel over there?

1484
05:04:00,759 --> 05:04:03,159
Get specials in Gap the Wavy Roof Hotel.

1485
05:04:04,119 --> 05:04:06,319
If I can do that.

1486
05:04:06,319 --> 05:04:13,639
Okay, specials.

1487
05:04:13,639 --> 05:04:14,200
Now, which...

1488
05:04:14,200 --> 05:04:15,080
Where does it want me to go?

1489
05:04:16,200 --> 05:04:16,680
This way.

1490
05:04:17,799 --> 05:04:18,860
Let's gap it.

1491
05:04:19,740 --> 05:04:20,380
Here we go.

1492
05:04:21,340 --> 05:04:22,459
What kind of special should I do?

1493
05:04:28,189 --> 05:04:37,240
I don't have enough...

1494
05:04:37,799 --> 05:04:38,680
I'm gonna get more of this.

1495
05:04:39,400 --> 05:04:39,900
Hold on.

1496
05:04:40,959 --> 05:04:41,459
Oops.

1497
05:04:42,080 --> 05:04:47,720
Gap the Wavy Roof Hotel.

1498
05:04:49,159 --> 05:04:52,439
Okay.

1499
05:04:52,439 --> 05:04:53,720
So, how am I gonna do this?

1500
05:05:10,729 --> 05:05:12,090
Holy shit!

1501
05:05:12,490 --> 05:05:13,450
There you go, man.

1502
05:05:13,450 --> 05:05:14,889
Forget the pink hotel.

1503
05:05:14,889 --> 05:05:17,610
Look, I'll shoot you getting a high score up here on the rooftop

1504
05:05:17,610 --> 05:05:18,490
and we'll call it a day.

1505
05:05:19,369 --> 05:05:20,810
Imagine getting that on camera.

1506
05:05:24,599 --> 05:05:28,040
You could live off the ad revenue from that video for the rest of your life.

1507
05:05:31,229 --> 05:05:32,750
That would get a hundred...

1508
05:05:32,750 --> 05:05:33,310
That would get...

1509
05:05:33,310 --> 05:05:35,389
That would get a million views a day.

1510
05:05:35,389 --> 05:05:35,889
Forever.

1511
05:05:40,490 --> 05:05:42,409
Get 50,000 coins on the roof.

1512
05:05:42,409 --> 05:05:42,909
Easy.

1513
05:05:47,759 --> 05:05:49,360
That was pretty cool, but I didn't know how to land it.

1514
05:05:50,240 --> 05:06:00,639
Again.

1515
05:06:01,340 --> 05:06:01,840
Oh!

1516
05:06:12,400 --> 05:06:12,900
No!

1517
05:06:13,439 --> 05:06:15,330
Sorry.

1518
05:06:22,599 --> 05:06:23,099
Fuck.

1519
05:06:32,139 --> 05:06:33,900
That was 44,000!

1520
05:06:55,340 --> 05:07:00,490
Spine transfer over this quarter pipe to the street below with a big spin.

1521
05:07:05,209 --> 05:07:05,709
I can do that.

1522
05:07:06,569 --> 05:07:07,069
Yeah!

1523
05:07:28,380 --> 05:07:28,939
Dude!

1524
05:07:28,939 --> 05:07:30,299
That was a spinning T-pose.

1525
05:07:30,299 --> 05:07:30,860
That was sick.

1526
05:07:32,060 --> 05:07:38,110
Vilemi just gave 5,000 bits.

1527
05:07:38,110 --> 05:07:39,229
Thanks for the $50 Vilemi.

1528
05:07:39,869 --> 05:07:40,750
Jeremiah just tuned in.

1529
05:07:40,750 --> 05:07:42,509
Why does your character look like Ron Weasley?

1530
05:07:43,310 --> 05:07:46,330
Thanks for the 50 fucking bucks Vilemi.

1531
05:07:48,090 --> 05:07:48,830
Because.

1532
05:07:49,290 --> 05:07:50,250
Because he just jumped.

1533
05:07:59,500 --> 05:08:00,540
A Mick Twist?

1534
05:08:01,419 --> 05:08:05,840
Get Special and do a Mick Twist over the helicopter.

1535
05:08:13,099 --> 05:08:14,860
Special and then Mick Twist.

1536
05:08:14,860 --> 05:08:15,740
Where's the helicopter?

1537
05:08:38,939 --> 05:08:40,939
I want to see how many times I can do it.

1538
05:08:42,909 --> 05:08:53,869
Here we go.

1539
05:08:53,869 --> 05:08:54,590
Mick Twist!

1540
05:09:04,430 --> 05:09:05,709
Oh, I can't even, man.

1541
05:09:05,709 --> 05:09:06,909
It's so stupid.

1542
05:09:06,909 --> 05:09:08,509
It's like not even...

1543
05:09:08,509 --> 05:09:08,909
Is that...

1544
05:09:08,909 --> 05:09:09,409
Oh.

1545
05:09:09,950 --> 05:09:10,669
Whatever.

1546
05:09:10,669 --> 05:09:11,169
Let's go.

1547
05:09:25,159 --> 05:09:27,080
That's just panic in the air.

1548
05:09:30,919 --> 05:09:31,400
Here we go!

1549
05:09:31,400 --> 05:09:32,520
I'm gonna do it!

1550
05:09:32,520 --> 05:09:32,840
Yeah!

1551
05:09:32,840 --> 05:09:33,720
You filming, man?

1552
05:09:33,720 --> 05:09:34,439
There we go!

1553
05:09:34,439 --> 05:09:34,939
Jump!

1554
05:09:35,240 --> 05:09:36,200
Oh my fucking God!

1555
05:09:36,200 --> 05:09:39,720
That's just flailing panic in the air without even a second thought.

1556
05:09:40,680 --> 05:09:45,369
You deleted it.

1557
05:09:48,400 --> 05:09:48,900
Oh.

1558
05:09:53,080 --> 05:09:55,000
Here's the 411 on Vancouver.

1559
05:09:55,000 --> 05:09:57,720
We got our video premiere all set up.

1560
05:09:57,720 --> 05:09:58,759
One problem.

1561
05:09:58,759 --> 05:10:00,840
We don't have a freaking video!

1562
05:10:00,840 --> 05:10:02,759
If your footage ain't done, get it.

1563
05:10:02,759 --> 05:10:05,560
And if it is done, help set up for the big event.

1564
05:10:05,560 --> 05:10:06,279
Got it?

1565
05:10:06,279 --> 05:10:06,779
Okay.

1566
05:10:08,439 --> 05:10:09,159
Sorry, Dad.

1567
05:10:15,159 --> 05:10:17,159
All right.

1568
05:10:17,159 --> 05:10:18,200
Last minute tasks.

1569
05:10:18,200 --> 05:10:18,700
Here we are.

1570
05:10:18,700 --> 05:10:24,830
I heard you guys have some killer footage cooked up for this video.

1571
05:10:24,830 --> 05:10:27,630
Something about a massive Hawaii gap or something?

1572
05:10:28,430 --> 05:10:29,549
Well, that was me.

1573
05:10:29,549 --> 05:10:30,430
I cleared that air.

1574
05:10:32,110 --> 05:10:33,069
No way!

1575
05:10:33,069 --> 05:10:34,110
You're not even a pro!

1576
05:10:35,069 --> 05:10:35,709
Yes, I am.

1577
05:10:37,840 --> 05:10:38,319
Goiki!

1578
05:10:38,319 --> 05:10:40,159
Thanks for the $50, Goiki.

1579
05:10:40,720 --> 05:10:42,560
5,000 bits from Goiki.

1580
05:10:43,279 --> 05:10:44,139
Appreciate it.

1581
05:10:44,700 --> 05:10:47,900
Jerma, if you won't become a voice actor, can you become a ska artist?

1582
05:10:50,099 --> 05:10:50,599
Ska?

1583
05:10:52,220 --> 05:10:52,720
Um...

1584
05:10:54,979 --> 05:10:56,020
Doesn't matter.

1585
05:10:56,020 --> 05:10:57,779
Just go with the premiere tonight and you'll see.

1586
05:11:01,759 --> 05:11:03,919
Uh, I mean, that's like the genre of music, isn't it?

1587
05:11:06,119 --> 05:11:07,319
Wouldn't miss it.

1588
05:11:07,319 --> 05:11:10,680
Hey, since we're here, why don't you let me shoot a little footage of you?

1589
05:11:12,470 --> 05:11:13,430
50,000 points.

1590
05:11:15,110 --> 05:11:19,569
You keepin' up?

1591
05:11:32,240 --> 05:11:33,119
Oh, and I landed it.

1592
05:11:34,080 --> 05:11:37,009
I hate that trick so much.

1593
05:11:37,810 --> 05:11:39,909
Okay, stop.

1594
05:11:40,869 --> 05:12:00,680
What?

1595
05:12:01,139 --> 05:12:08,979
22,000.

1596
05:12:10,240 --> 05:12:13,220
It's a laggy level.

1597
05:12:17,490 --> 05:12:17,970
Why did I do that?

1598
05:12:17,970 --> 05:12:19,090
I was waiting to do a revert.

1599
05:12:19,090 --> 05:12:19,569
Restart?

1600
05:12:19,569 --> 05:12:20,069
No.

1601
05:12:20,689 --> 05:12:30,599
It's been gone.

1602
05:12:30,599 --> 05:12:32,849
Oh, laggy Lenny.

1603
05:12:33,569 --> 05:12:38,069
What else we got here?

1604
05:12:45,959 --> 05:12:46,759
50 FPS.

1605
05:12:47,639 --> 05:12:51,319
I will say, let's be completely honest to the Xbox 360.

1606
05:12:52,520 --> 05:12:53,020
This?

1607
05:12:53,240 --> 05:12:53,880
That guy got a gun?

1608
05:12:54,840 --> 05:12:57,840
Okay, I thought he had a gun.

1609
05:12:57,840 --> 05:12:58,340
Um...

1610
05:13:01,119 --> 05:13:02,240
This looks really good.

1611
05:13:02,880 --> 05:13:05,119
Remember, this is an original Xbox game.

1612
05:13:05,840 --> 05:13:07,750
It's the original Xbox disc.

1613
05:13:08,709 --> 05:13:12,099
This looks actually pretty good for being an original Xbox.

1614
05:13:12,740 --> 05:13:13,240
Upscaled.

1615
05:13:15,680 --> 05:13:17,380
What the heck is that?

1616
05:13:21,700 --> 05:13:23,540
That's a leaf blower cart.

1617
05:13:23,540 --> 05:13:25,619
I use it to clean up these plazas.

1618
05:13:25,619 --> 05:13:28,900
I'll let you try it out, but you've gotta do my work for me.

1619
05:13:28,900 --> 05:13:31,299
I'm not even sure, this game I think is like 480p.

1620
05:13:32,259 --> 05:13:34,180
Or maybe even like something like that.

1621
05:13:34,180 --> 05:13:36,340
There was no HD on the original Xbox.

1622
05:13:37,060 --> 05:13:37,939
No, wait, not even close.

1623
05:13:39,220 --> 05:13:43,029
Was this 720 on the Xbox?

1624
05:13:43,830 --> 05:13:45,299
It's probably 480, wasn't it?

1625
05:13:57,400 --> 05:13:59,000
Leaf Blow Company.

1626
05:13:59,000 --> 05:14:01,509
Loud as fuck.

1627
05:14:15,569 --> 05:14:17,729
PlayStation 2 was the...

1628
05:14:17,729 --> 05:14:18,229
No.

1629
05:14:19,720 --> 05:14:21,799
The PS2 was not capable of 720?

1630
05:14:23,889 --> 05:14:25,090
I do not remember that.

1631
05:14:31,669 --> 05:14:32,389
No, no way.

1632
05:14:32,950 --> 05:14:41,299
PS2 could do 1080i.

1633
05:14:43,840 --> 05:14:44,340
I...

1634
05:14:45,240 --> 05:14:45,740
I...

1635
05:14:46,200 --> 05:14:46,919
I have...

1636
05:14:46,919 --> 05:14:48,599
Going to have to say I do not believe you.

1637
05:14:49,560 --> 05:15:01,180
Come on.

1638
05:15:01,560 --> 05:15:07,000
Is that right?

1639
05:15:07,000 --> 05:15:07,500
No, more?

1640
05:15:08,680 --> 05:15:16,459
Broke up.

1641
05:15:19,240 --> 05:15:19,740
Nice.

1642
05:15:21,220 --> 05:15:21,860
That was cute.

1643
05:15:21,860 --> 05:15:22,360
That was fun.

1644
05:15:23,139 --> 05:15:24,970
PS2.

1645
05:15:24,970 --> 05:15:26,310
PS2 had some of the best games.

1646
05:15:27,110 --> 05:15:33,680
I will agree with you there.

1647
05:15:34,240 --> 05:15:43,380
Just want to get air.

1648
05:15:43,380 --> 05:15:44,900
See if I can get some more air points.

1649
05:15:48,979 --> 05:15:49,479
No?

1650
05:15:49,479 --> 05:15:50,349
Oh well.

1651
05:15:54,150 --> 05:15:55,110
Slam City.

1652
05:16:00,630 --> 05:16:02,150
I just turned my mic up a little.

1653
05:16:02,150 --> 05:16:02,869
Better or worse?

1654
05:16:08,069 --> 05:16:08,470
Better?

1655
05:16:08,470 --> 05:16:08,970
Worse?

1656
05:16:09,909 --> 05:16:11,439
Better?

1657
05:16:11,439 --> 05:16:12,580
Better?

1658
05:16:12,580 --> 05:16:15,569
Okay.

1659
05:16:15,569 --> 05:16:16,069
Failed.

1660
05:16:17,889 --> 05:16:19,009
Combo all...

1661
05:16:19,009 --> 05:16:20,049
Combo all of them.

1662
05:16:20,849 --> 05:16:24,099
Oh, this is going to be hard.

1663
05:16:24,900 --> 05:16:41,750
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

1664
05:16:43,669 --> 05:16:44,470
A lot of missions here.

1665
05:16:45,430 --> 05:16:46,310
Turn the music up.

1666
05:16:58,439 --> 05:17:00,279
Please don't ever turn your mic down.

1667
05:17:09,759 --> 05:17:10,479
I'm going to turn it down.

1668
05:17:11,520 --> 05:17:12,479
I'm turning it down right now.

1669
05:17:20,799 --> 05:17:21,680
No, please!

1670
05:17:21,680 --> 05:17:22,180
No!

1671
05:17:22,799 --> 05:17:27,279
All right.

1672
05:17:27,279 --> 05:17:29,040
Hit all the Flatland tricks.

1673
05:17:29,599 --> 05:17:31,279
Got to do manual tricks.

1674
05:17:31,279 --> 05:17:33,200
Oh, these are always a pain in the ass for me.

1675
05:18:04,310 --> 05:18:06,389
I know I don't do them all at once, but I know.

1676
05:18:06,389 --> 05:18:06,950
I know, I know.

1677
05:18:06,950 --> 05:18:08,630
But that's fun for my brain.

1678
05:18:10,069 --> 05:18:11,990
It scratches a niche in my brain to do them all together.

1679
05:18:13,029 --> 05:18:42,400
Truck stand.

1680
05:18:42,400 --> 05:18:43,119
Do a truck stand.

1681
05:18:44,000 --> 05:18:44,500
Y and X.

1682
05:18:45,360 --> 05:18:49,409
Y and X is truck stand.

1683
05:18:49,409 --> 05:18:49,909
What the fuck?

1684
05:18:54,340 --> 05:18:54,840
Y, X.

1685
05:18:55,540 --> 05:18:56,180
Y, X.

1686
05:18:56,900 --> 05:18:57,400
Oh.

1687
05:18:58,180 --> 05:18:58,680
Okay.

1688
05:18:59,700 --> 05:19:06,659
God, these manuals are going to kill me.

1689
05:19:07,540 --> 05:19:09,860
Look at that fucking row that we're going to clear out right now.

1690
05:19:10,020 --> 05:19:11,139
Fucking manual Tetris.

1691
05:19:15,430 --> 05:19:16,549
I have to look at the controller.

1692
05:19:16,549 --> 05:19:17,049
I know.

1693
05:19:17,669 --> 05:19:20,180
You don't understand.

1694
05:19:23,029 --> 05:19:23,590
Truck stand.

1695
05:19:24,229 --> 05:19:25,590
Why would I do a truck stand?

1696
05:19:25,590 --> 05:19:26,090
Y and X.

1697
05:19:27,110 --> 05:19:28,470
Y and X together, man.

1698
05:19:58,740 --> 05:19:59,700
Camera ready.

1699
05:19:59,700 --> 05:20:01,939
Get 5,000 points in a manual combo.

1700
05:20:02,979 --> 05:20:14,020
Oh, I had 29,000 points.

1701
05:20:29,040 --> 05:20:30,880
This guy sucks.

1702
05:20:32,869 --> 05:20:35,349
Whenever somebody says that, I feel like that's how it's being said.

1703
05:20:36,310 --> 05:20:37,669
The sucks part is slowed down.

1704
05:20:38,470 --> 05:20:39,110
This guy.

1705
05:20:39,110 --> 05:20:40,470
This guy sucks.

1706
05:20:41,189 --> 05:20:45,409
Hey, Bob.

1707
05:20:45,409 --> 05:20:46,130
What are you doing?

1708
05:20:47,430 --> 05:20:47,930
Bob?

1709
05:20:48,389 --> 05:20:50,950
I've been working on this new manual for Casper Handstand.

1710
05:20:50,950 --> 05:20:51,830
Want to give it a try?

1711
05:20:52,790 --> 05:20:56,369
Get special and see if you can pull it while hitting my line.

1712
05:20:57,569 --> 05:20:59,810
Get special and see if you can do the Casper Handstand.

1713
05:21:15,700 --> 05:21:24,000
Now hit your line with the Casper Handstand.

1714
05:21:24,880 --> 05:21:31,560
I mean, I did it, but what's your line?

1715
05:21:32,360 --> 05:21:34,950
Got the line right there, man.

1716
05:21:37,189 --> 05:21:37,689
Very slow.

1717
05:21:38,389 --> 05:21:53,159
Wait, is it not a grind?

1718
05:21:54,680 --> 05:21:56,290
Just do it down the stairs.

1719
05:22:20,979 --> 05:22:21,619
Got it.

1720
05:22:21,619 --> 05:22:32,279
Okay, what else is left?

1721
05:22:32,279 --> 05:22:38,119
We have skate, Tom's part, party drags, Ralphie got busted.

1722
05:22:39,569 --> 05:22:40,369
Filming a line.

1723
05:22:41,720 --> 05:22:42,360
Hey, bro.

1724
05:22:42,360 --> 05:22:44,279
I'm about to hit a line through the underground.

1725
05:22:44,279 --> 05:22:45,400
I need to get some footage.

1726
05:22:45,400 --> 05:22:46,599
Can you follow me with the camera?

1727
05:22:49,000 --> 05:22:55,250
Well, you didn't.

1728
05:22:55,250 --> 05:22:56,049
Why are you not moving?

1729
05:23:12,950 --> 05:23:13,590
He's gone.

1730
05:23:15,220 --> 05:23:16,020
Shitty footage.

1731
05:23:16,020 --> 05:23:17,139
What are you guys doing over here?

1732
05:23:17,139 --> 05:23:18,180
Is he busting some fat ones?

1733
05:23:18,180 --> 05:23:24,069
Those missions are so, uh, not good.

1734
05:23:24,630 --> 05:23:26,549
It's just so, those are so bad.

1735
05:23:27,909 --> 05:23:29,669
This game is like a 97.

1736
05:23:30,470 --> 05:23:31,669
But those are so bad.

1737
05:23:32,470 --> 05:23:33,110
It's terrible.

1738
05:23:34,549 --> 05:23:36,069
Okay, how are you guys doing over here?

1739
05:23:36,069 --> 05:23:37,349
Is he busting some fat ones?

1740
05:23:39,880 --> 05:23:40,599
Dude, look at him.

1741
05:23:40,599 --> 05:23:41,400
He can't skate.

1742
05:23:48,290 --> 05:23:54,840
The fool is still drunk from the hotel party

1743
05:23:54,840 --> 05:23:57,319
and I need footage of him to complete this video.

1744
05:23:57,319 --> 05:23:59,639
He was going to bust some Nollies here at the museum.

1745
05:23:59,639 --> 05:24:00,840
Can you fill in for him?

1746
05:24:00,840 --> 05:24:02,119
I won't film your face.

1747
05:24:03,080 --> 05:24:03,580
Okay.

1748
05:24:04,279 --> 05:24:05,639
Record five Nollies.

1749
05:24:05,639 --> 05:24:07,720
Hit L twice to enter Nollie state.

1750
05:24:09,000 --> 05:24:15,250
You broke my fucking leg, buddy.

1751
05:24:19,299 --> 05:24:21,139
L twice to enter Nollie state?

1752
05:24:21,939 --> 05:24:35,119
Get this on fucking camera instead.

1753
05:24:35,759 --> 05:24:38,000
That's like way cooler.

1754
05:24:47,240 --> 05:24:49,720
Um, I don't understand what to do.

1755
05:24:49,720 --> 05:24:51,159
Record five Nollies.

1756
05:24:51,159 --> 05:24:53,639
Hit L twice to enter Nollie state.

1757
05:24:54,279 --> 05:24:59,200
Oh, fuck.

1758
05:24:59,200 --> 05:24:59,700
Okay.

1759
05:24:59,700 --> 05:25:00,720
Switch pressure.

1760
05:25:00,720 --> 05:25:01,220
Bakey?

1761
05:25:03,720 --> 05:25:04,599
Bakey Ollie.

1762
05:25:05,569 --> 05:25:06,130
Pressure.

1763
05:25:06,130 --> 05:25:06,630
Okay.

1764
05:25:07,009 --> 05:25:07,810
Switch pressure.

1765
05:25:13,700 --> 05:25:14,419
Nollie.

1766
05:25:14,419 --> 05:25:15,139
Nollie.

1767
05:25:15,139 --> 05:25:15,860
Nollie.

1768
05:25:15,860 --> 05:25:16,580
Nollie.

1769
05:25:16,580 --> 05:25:17,220
Nollie.

1770
05:25:17,220 --> 05:25:18,020
Nollie.

1771
05:25:18,020 --> 05:25:18,580
Nollie.

1772
05:25:18,580 --> 05:25:19,080
Nollie.

1773
05:25:19,619 --> 05:25:20,119
Nollie.

1774
05:25:23,669 --> 05:25:24,169
Nollie.

1775
05:25:25,990 --> 05:25:26,490
Nollie.

1776
05:25:28,200 --> 05:25:28,700
Nollie.

1777
05:25:29,159 --> 05:25:29,799
What am I doing?

1778
05:25:40,209 --> 05:25:41,250
Don't do drugs.

1779
05:25:43,840 --> 05:25:45,200
Oh, awesome.

1780
05:25:45,200 --> 05:25:46,880
You better stop landing those Nollies

1781
05:25:46,880 --> 05:25:49,279
so cleanly or no one will believe it's Tom.

1782
05:25:49,279 --> 05:25:50,560
Drunk bastard.

1783
05:25:50,560 --> 05:25:52,720
Anyhow, cruise over here and bust some pressure flips

1784
05:25:52,720 --> 05:25:54,000
and we should be good to go.

1785
05:25:54,000 --> 05:25:54,799
Pressure flips.

1786
05:25:55,759 --> 05:26:10,020
I don't know much about, like, skating.

1787
05:26:10,580 --> 05:26:12,419
So what's the difference between this and a Nollie?

1788
05:26:12,419 --> 05:26:12,819
Thanks.

1789
05:26:12,819 --> 05:26:14,500
That will make perfect filler.

1790
05:26:14,500 --> 05:26:15,619
Okay, one more part.

1791
05:26:15,619 --> 05:26:17,619
You skate this plaza and I'll film combos

1792
05:26:17,619 --> 05:26:19,299
starting with Nollies or pressure flips.

1793
05:26:19,299 --> 05:26:21,540
We'll need some serious points for some good footage.

1794
05:26:22,259 --> 05:26:23,540
Nollie is off the front of the board.

1795
05:26:25,939 --> 05:26:26,259
Okay.

1796
05:26:26,259 --> 05:26:29,540
Record 25,000 points incorporating Nollies and pressures.

1797
05:26:29,540 --> 05:26:30,040
Sure.

1798
05:26:30,580 --> 05:26:42,310
Alright, let's get a Nollie in here.

1799
05:26:44,529 --> 05:26:46,130
Bakey, switch, pressure.

1800
05:26:46,130 --> 05:26:46,770
Pressure.

1801
05:26:46,770 --> 05:26:47,889
Bakey, switch, pressure.

1802
05:26:54,130 --> 05:26:54,630
Nollie.

1803
05:27:03,080 --> 05:27:04,759
A lot of good ball jokes this stream.

1804
05:27:04,759 --> 05:27:05,259
Yeah.

1805
05:27:06,200 --> 05:27:07,720
There's been a lot of good ball jokes here, right?

1806
05:27:08,599 --> 05:27:14,150
That wasn't one.

1807
05:27:15,110 --> 05:27:17,810
I know a ton of you guys are just on the edge of your seat right there.

1808
05:27:19,009 --> 05:27:31,990
By the way, did anybody just open the screen for the first time?

1809
05:27:32,709 --> 05:27:33,840
Just curious.

1810
05:27:34,479 --> 05:27:39,400
Hello.

1811
05:27:39,400 --> 05:27:43,799
If you have, welcome.

1812
05:27:44,279 --> 05:27:45,400
My name's German985.

1813
05:27:45,400 --> 05:27:46,360
I'm playing Tony Hawk.

1814
05:27:47,000 --> 05:27:48,450
You might think it looks a little different.

1815
05:27:48,450 --> 05:27:49,009
It's underground.

1816
05:27:49,009 --> 05:27:50,049
It's not a numbered one.

1817
05:27:50,930 --> 05:27:51,650
Thanks for the follow.

1818
05:27:52,209 --> 05:27:53,139
Appreciate that.

1819
05:27:54,020 --> 05:27:56,439
Welcome to the stream.

1820
05:27:56,439 --> 05:27:56,939
Welcome.

1821
05:27:59,250 --> 05:28:05,560
What's going on?

1822
05:28:05,560 --> 05:28:11,279
The cops nabbed me when I bailed in the museum plaza.

1823
05:28:11,279 --> 05:28:12,560
Couldn't find my passport.

1824
05:28:14,180 --> 05:28:14,900
Make another one?

1825
05:28:14,900 --> 05:28:15,459
Yeah, I will.

1826
05:28:15,459 --> 05:28:16,180
Hold on.

1827
05:28:16,180 --> 05:28:16,900
Where'd you bail?

1828
05:28:23,479 --> 05:28:24,840
You gotta find the gardener.

1829
05:28:24,840 --> 05:28:25,400
Maybe he found it.

1830
05:28:25,400 --> 05:28:26,200
Where'd you bail?

1831
05:28:27,240 --> 05:28:29,000
Find the leaf blower guy.

1832
05:28:29,959 --> 05:28:33,299
All right, you know, is he in the hotel?

1833
05:28:40,200 --> 05:28:40,680
Right here.

1834
05:28:41,939 --> 05:28:42,659
Passport.

1835
05:28:42,659 --> 05:28:46,979
Well, I haven't seen it, but there are quite a few leaf piles around here.

1836
05:28:46,979 --> 05:28:50,500
If you want to search them all quickly, you can use the leaf blower cart.

1837
05:28:57,279 --> 05:28:58,400
55 seconds.

1838
05:29:01,700 --> 05:29:02,580
They're all right here.

1839
05:29:02,580 --> 05:29:07,200
One, two, three, four.

1840
05:29:07,200 --> 05:29:07,919
They're all right here.

1841
05:29:07,919 --> 05:29:20,209
I got one up top with a six one.

1842
05:29:21,639 --> 05:29:22,919
No, Jeremy.

1843
05:29:24,880 --> 05:29:26,000
There's one right here.

1844
05:29:26,000 --> 05:29:27,439
Okay, I got a line.

1845
05:29:28,479 --> 05:29:41,779
This dropped my full plate of dinner on the ground in front of my mother.

1846
05:29:42,740 --> 05:29:47,380
Where is it?

1847
05:29:48,340 --> 05:29:48,819
Huh?

1848
05:29:48,819 --> 05:29:49,220
Guys?

1849
05:29:53,330 --> 05:29:54,930
I thought it was further down.

1850
05:29:54,930 --> 05:29:55,250
Fuck.

1851
05:30:05,189 --> 05:30:07,509
My mother made an entire false spread of food.

1852
05:30:08,630 --> 05:30:11,189
And I dropped all of it on the floor.

1853
05:30:11,189 --> 05:30:14,520
Potentially a new floor, new carpet or something.

1854
05:30:15,240 --> 05:30:19,680
Just like, no, Jeremy, what are you doing?

1855
05:30:19,680 --> 05:30:20,319
It's okay.

1856
05:30:20,319 --> 05:30:20,880
It's all right.

1857
05:30:21,840 --> 05:30:22,400
It's okay.

1858
05:30:24,040 --> 05:30:24,279
Yes.

1859
05:30:25,479 --> 05:30:29,459
Just go.

1860
05:30:30,659 --> 05:30:32,020
It's all right.

1861
05:30:33,220 --> 05:30:33,700
It's all right.

1862
05:30:33,700 --> 05:30:37,200
Just grab some towels.

1863
05:30:37,919 --> 05:30:43,009
Expensive floor.

1864
05:30:43,889 --> 05:30:54,069
Please be more careful next time.

1865
05:30:54,709 --> 05:30:56,130
I'm sorry, Bob.

1866
05:30:56,770 --> 05:30:57,250
It's okay.

1867
05:30:58,130 --> 05:31:01,759
I'm in a towel ladder.

1868
05:31:12,049 --> 05:31:13,729
I would be in a lot of trouble by now.

1869
05:31:34,799 --> 05:31:35,200
Wow.

1870
05:31:39,270 --> 05:31:39,590
Fuck.

1871
05:31:39,590 --> 05:31:40,709
It's so hard to control.

1872
05:31:41,669 --> 05:31:41,990
All right.

1873
05:31:41,990 --> 05:31:42,549
Now, go.

1874
05:31:43,349 --> 05:31:48,259
Pitchy face.

1875
05:31:48,819 --> 05:31:50,389
Okay.

1876
05:32:14,150 --> 05:32:15,750
Tonight's my night.

1877
05:32:26,310 --> 05:32:26,790
Thanks, man.

1878
05:32:28,310 --> 05:32:29,509
Get everyone to the premiere.

1879
05:32:30,630 --> 05:32:31,169
What?

1880
05:32:32,130 --> 05:32:35,110
Why does the camera just swing?

1881
05:32:35,750 --> 05:32:50,709
These are all of our friends.

1882
05:32:54,040 --> 05:32:55,000
Why'd it happen to the color?

1883
05:32:55,000 --> 05:32:55,319
Yeah.

1884
05:32:55,319 --> 05:32:56,200
Why is the color on?

1885
05:32:56,919 --> 05:33:05,840
Did it go down here?

1886
05:33:06,799 --> 05:33:07,360
That's weird.

1887
05:33:08,479 --> 05:33:09,970
Get everybody to the premiere.

1888
05:33:11,360 --> 05:33:12,080
Come on.

1889
05:33:12,080 --> 05:33:12,319
Quick.

1890
05:33:13,040 --> 05:33:29,759
We have this many friends?

1891
05:33:30,720 --> 05:33:31,919
His neck was backwards.

1892
05:33:31,919 --> 05:33:33,279
I guess his head was on backwards.

1893
05:33:34,000 --> 05:33:53,560
He made it.

1894
05:33:53,560 --> 05:33:53,799
All right.

1895
05:33:53,799 --> 05:33:54,279
Let's see.

1896
05:33:54,279 --> 05:33:57,080
Let's take a look at my skiing footage.

1897
05:33:57,080 --> 05:34:09,009
This game is so shit.

1898
05:34:09,009 --> 05:34:09,889
Laughing my ass off.

1899
05:34:09,889 --> 05:34:12,610
What a funny pretend comment that is.

1900
05:34:13,169 --> 05:34:13,729
Hard.

1901
05:34:13,729 --> 05:34:14,770
You weren't even in it.

1902
05:34:14,770 --> 05:34:18,680
But Eric's gets rooftop gap I've ever seen.

1903
05:34:18,680 --> 05:34:20,439
Eric edited his face on my footage.

1904
05:34:20,439 --> 05:34:24,240
Forty stones.

1905
05:34:24,240 --> 05:34:25,919
My trick in my spot.

1906
05:34:29,720 --> 05:34:33,319
To introduce our newest pro, Eric's.

1907
05:34:33,319 --> 05:34:37,060
Eric.

1908
05:34:37,060 --> 05:34:37,860
Editing his face.

1909
05:34:37,860 --> 05:34:38,900
Eric's on his way to the last gap.

1910
05:34:38,900 --> 05:34:43,720
And his first pro board will become two months.

1911
05:34:43,720 --> 05:34:44,360
Hey, Eric.

1912
05:34:44,360 --> 05:34:46,279
Do that trick that you did off the roof again.

1913
05:34:46,279 --> 05:34:46,919
That's what I would do.

1914
05:34:47,479 --> 05:34:49,159
You poached my shots.

1915
05:34:49,159 --> 05:34:50,119
Where's my footage?

1916
05:34:50,919 --> 05:34:51,560
Oh, man.

1917
05:34:51,560 --> 05:34:52,279
I put them on the spot.

1918
05:34:52,279 --> 05:34:53,959
I told myself to tell you, see.

1919
05:34:53,959 --> 05:34:55,639
There was this thing at customs.

1920
05:34:57,799 --> 05:35:00,200
Hey, we go way back.

1921
05:35:00,200 --> 05:35:02,200
So I'm going to forget you just did that.

1922
05:35:03,000 --> 05:35:04,919
Now listen, I got three parties to hit.

1923
05:35:04,919 --> 05:35:08,599
But you better go rest up for the amateur contest tomorrow.

1924
05:35:12,159 --> 05:35:12,659
Dick.

1925
05:35:13,650 --> 05:35:15,650
Just need some basic information from you.

1926
05:35:23,840 --> 05:35:26,479
Budget 3D Bible show.

1927
05:35:26,479 --> 05:35:27,439
You're a pro?

1928
05:35:27,439 --> 05:35:29,119
They entered you as an amateur.

1929
05:35:29,119 --> 05:35:30,159
Someone made a mistake.

1930
05:35:31,119 --> 05:35:35,009
Here's my ride.

1931
05:35:35,009 --> 05:35:44,819
Destroy the slam city jam.

1932
05:35:44,819 --> 05:35:53,970
This is a cool park.

1933
05:35:54,770 --> 05:36:03,750
You guys, I think the skate park would make a big return.

1934
05:36:04,869 --> 05:36:06,290
It's getting so hard.

1935
05:36:07,090 --> 05:36:08,049
Who in this kind of shit?

1936
05:36:08,049 --> 05:36:09,970
I mean, obviously, this is like an arcade game.

1937
05:36:11,090 --> 05:36:12,369
But holy shit.

1938
05:36:13,250 --> 05:36:16,450
It takes so much skill to be able to do any of this shit.

1939
05:36:17,569 --> 05:36:22,610
Oh, my God.

1940
05:36:22,610 --> 05:36:23,650
That would have been fucking a lot.

1941
05:36:24,770 --> 05:36:26,200
This isn't real.

1942
05:36:26,200 --> 05:36:28,520
Yeah, but have you ever seen an actual skate video before?

1943
05:36:29,479 --> 05:36:31,080
That shit is insane.

1944
05:36:34,200 --> 05:36:37,560
I had to jump in with a board and sliding down a bar

1945
05:36:37,560 --> 05:36:40,439
and not like fucking instantly dying.

1946
05:36:42,259 --> 05:36:45,459
Like, oh, I'm just going to jump down the 30 flights of stairs on a bar.

1947
05:36:45,459 --> 05:36:47,139
Like, holy shit, that's so scary.

1948
05:36:48,259 --> 05:36:52,500
It takes so much skill, so much patience.

1949
05:36:53,220 --> 05:36:56,869
I'm on the list.

1950
05:36:57,590 --> 05:36:59,270
Destroy the street competition.

1951
05:36:59,990 --> 05:37:01,430
My best.

1952
05:37:19,080 --> 05:37:20,439
Should we show them up our special move?

1953
05:37:20,439 --> 05:37:21,959
OK, I got to incorporate my special move.

1954
05:37:56,549 --> 05:37:59,349
Oh, that felt nice.

1955
05:37:59,349 --> 05:37:59,849
Damn it.

1956
05:38:10,740 --> 05:38:11,540
I love this game.

1957
05:38:18,959 --> 05:38:20,720
No, Xbox.

1958
05:38:21,360 --> 05:38:22,000
Xbox.

1959
05:38:22,000 --> 05:38:23,360
Why Xbox?

1960
05:38:23,360 --> 05:38:25,279
That was like 180,000 points.

1961
05:38:25,279 --> 05:38:26,639
Xbox, what have you done to me?

1962
05:38:28,470 --> 05:38:29,509
Xbox, what have you done?

1963
05:38:34,040 --> 05:38:36,439
OK, well, I mean, I got I'm in first place.

1964
05:38:36,439 --> 05:38:37,240
Eric Sparrow stuff.

1965
05:38:38,200 --> 05:38:39,520
Let's go.

1966
05:38:39,520 --> 05:38:40,020
Wow.

1967
05:38:43,509 --> 05:39:07,650
No, no, don't do it yet.

1968
05:39:18,319 --> 05:39:20,419
Ooh, don't end it yet.

1969
05:39:20,419 --> 05:39:27,799
No, dude, I just went through it.

1970
05:39:28,360 --> 05:39:29,799
All right, 200,000 should be good.

1971
05:40:01,439 --> 05:40:05,110
Big finish, here we go.

1972
05:40:07,669 --> 05:40:08,630
God damn it.

1973
05:40:08,630 --> 05:40:09,509
Come on, big finish.

1974
05:40:19,750 --> 05:40:20,919
I'm still dumb.

1975
05:40:21,720 --> 05:40:22,840
I can literally do whatever I want.

1976
05:40:23,799 --> 05:40:25,409
I almost have a perfect score.

1977
05:40:26,130 --> 05:40:34,229
Actually, I'm going to go for a monster combo.

1978
05:40:34,790 --> 05:40:46,069
I like this space.

1979
05:40:46,069 --> 05:40:46,549
It's great.

1980
05:40:57,169 --> 05:40:58,209
Are you kidding me?

1981
05:40:58,209 --> 05:40:59,009
What the hell was that?

1982
05:40:59,889 --> 05:41:10,360
You seeing this shit?

1983
05:41:10,360 --> 05:41:11,560
Mom, get the camera.

1984
05:41:11,560 --> 05:41:40,880
Some half-pipe shit.

1985
05:41:59,270 --> 05:41:59,770
It's OK.

1986
05:42:02,520 --> 05:42:03,880
Oh, that was so much fun.

1987
05:42:04,520 --> 05:42:06,439
Just flying around and going like.

1988
05:42:10,119 --> 05:42:11,619
I love it.

1989
05:42:11,619 --> 05:42:43,909
It was 133,000 to get some practice in hip transfer these ramps by skating up the first

1990
05:42:43,909 --> 05:42:47,189
quarter pipe at an angle and cutting the corner in the game is so good.

1991
05:42:47,189 --> 05:42:48,389
It's always up to.

1992
05:42:48,389 --> 05:42:53,919
Yeah, it was hip hip transfer these ramps by skating up the first quarter pipe at an

1993
05:42:53,919 --> 05:42:55,680
angle and then cutting the corner in the air.

1994
05:42:55,680 --> 05:42:59,119
After you jump at an angle, press this hip transfer to the other side.

1995
05:43:00,639 --> 05:43:02,439
Watch this guy.

1996
05:43:03,240 --> 05:43:06,259
He's not very good.

1997
05:43:13,669 --> 05:43:22,439
Oh, again, the same hip transfer first, then continue on to the second.

1998
05:43:22,439 --> 05:43:23,479
Who hip transfers?

1999
05:43:25,319 --> 05:43:30,369
I mean, that was fucking awesome.

2000
05:43:30,369 --> 05:43:31,729
Way better than what you wanted me to do.

2001
05:43:44,310 --> 05:44:02,360
All right, let's do some more stuff.

2002
05:44:03,159 --> 05:44:07,700
How does it never get old?

2003
05:44:07,700 --> 05:44:08,099
I don't know.

2004
05:44:08,099 --> 05:44:08,900
It just doesn't.

2005
05:44:08,900 --> 05:44:09,400
Weird.

2006
05:44:10,580 --> 05:44:13,330
Any more quests?

2007
05:44:14,049 --> 05:44:19,459
I want to put some new tricks on, too, because these are getting a little stale to me.

2008
05:44:20,419 --> 05:44:23,159
Edit tricks.

2009
05:44:24,279 --> 05:44:24,919
Wrap tricks.

2010
05:44:24,919 --> 05:44:25,479
I want to do.

2011
05:44:27,479 --> 05:44:28,439
Get rid of the melon.

2012
05:44:28,439 --> 05:44:32,979
Let's put on fucking cannonball here to the Indy and let's do the Madonna.

2013
05:44:34,759 --> 05:44:35,720
Get rid of the Japan.

2014
05:44:35,720 --> 05:44:36,439
Let's put on.

2015
05:44:38,450 --> 05:44:40,930
Stale fish instead of Indy Stiffy.

2016
05:44:40,930 --> 05:44:44,369
Let's do a crossbar.

2017
05:44:44,369 --> 05:44:44,930
Let's check it out.

2018
05:44:59,810 --> 05:45:04,790
I got to learn how to see what it was like.

2019
05:45:04,790 --> 05:45:06,549
The actual part here.

2020
05:45:07,909 --> 05:45:09,759
Hard to land.

2021
05:45:10,880 --> 05:45:12,470
Yeah, that's hard to land.

2022
05:45:20,919 --> 05:45:22,360
Oh, whoa.

2023
05:45:22,360 --> 05:45:22,759
Hold on.

2024
05:45:24,180 --> 05:45:24,819
Christ air.

2025
05:45:28,500 --> 05:45:29,860
They're all kind of hard to land.

2026
05:45:29,860 --> 05:45:42,840
That's all right.

2027
05:45:42,840 --> 05:45:43,880
You're killing this guy.

2028
05:45:44,520 --> 05:45:52,450
He'll be fine.

2029
05:45:52,450 --> 05:45:53,169
Christ air.

2030
05:45:53,169 --> 05:45:54,049
Fine.

2031
05:46:08,020 --> 05:46:09,619
We're making our own Christ air.

2032
05:46:09,619 --> 05:46:17,490
All right.

2033
05:46:17,490 --> 05:46:18,209
Holdable.

2034
05:46:18,209 --> 05:46:18,709
Yes.

2035
05:46:41,220 --> 05:46:42,180
Just make him a drill.

2036
05:46:42,740 --> 05:46:44,419
No, we can't spin.

2037
05:46:44,419 --> 05:46:51,270
Just turn him into a helicopter.

2038
05:46:52,310 --> 05:46:54,470
I'm it's going to be another spin joke.

2039
05:46:54,470 --> 05:46:55,909
That's going to be fucking great.

2040
05:47:19,860 --> 05:47:20,180
All right.

2041
05:47:20,180 --> 05:47:36,439
That's good.

2042
05:47:36,439 --> 05:47:56,799
Somebody said just do Christ air,

2043
05:47:56,799 --> 05:47:58,000
but just add a fart to it.

2044
05:48:00,759 --> 05:48:02,520
Imagine if I actually did something like that.

2045
05:48:04,119 --> 05:48:04,520
That's it.

2046
05:48:04,520 --> 05:48:05,560
That's the only change.

2047
05:48:09,970 --> 05:48:10,450
What is it?

2048
05:48:11,810 --> 05:48:12,610
There's a toy.

2049
05:48:15,590 --> 05:48:17,909
There's a toy that you pull a little string

2050
05:48:17,909 --> 05:48:20,709
and it like spins and it's like a flower that opens up.

2051
05:48:21,349 --> 05:48:25,400
You know what I'm talking about?

2052
05:48:27,080 --> 05:48:29,319
It's like a little it's like a cheap little toy

2053
05:48:29,319 --> 05:48:33,400
that just like you can like open it up, open it up, open it up.

2054
05:48:33,400 --> 05:48:34,200
What are those things called?

2055
05:48:35,080 --> 05:48:41,240
They're like a dollar.

2056
05:48:41,240 --> 05:48:48,080
Oh, how many can I add?

2057
05:48:53,090 --> 05:48:54,369
That hurts my head actually.

2058
05:49:03,459 --> 05:49:05,860
It's one of those it's a full helicopter.

2059
05:49:05,860 --> 05:49:57,680
Oh, it's too much.

2060
05:49:57,680 --> 05:49:58,959
It needs to be shorter.

2061
05:49:58,959 --> 05:50:03,200
It needs to be shorter by a little bit.

2062
05:50:11,009 --> 05:50:12,340
Imagine holding this.

2063
05:50:13,220 --> 05:50:23,439
I want a quick one.

2064
05:50:23,439 --> 05:50:24,159
No, hold on.

2065
05:50:25,200 --> 05:50:30,259
It's holdable.

2066
05:50:40,770 --> 05:50:42,209
Make it 0.1 second.

2067
05:50:43,330 --> 05:50:53,729
I'm glad you think that was any different.

2068
05:50:53,729 --> 05:50:54,849
It's the same thing.

2069
05:50:56,049 --> 05:50:56,369
Just.

2070
05:51:04,930 --> 05:51:24,200
Okay, back to editor.

2071
05:51:50,639 --> 05:51:51,119
You know what?

2072
05:51:52,720 --> 05:52:07,560
No, no, I've got a better idea.

2073
05:52:16,720 --> 05:52:18,240
I want to be able to do a kickflip

2074
05:52:18,240 --> 05:52:19,680
but just do a backflip.

2075
05:52:19,680 --> 05:52:21,430
You know what I mean?

2076
05:52:21,430 --> 05:52:22,470
Just like, bam.

2077
05:52:33,430 --> 05:52:40,130
Imagine doing a backflip on landing it on a grind.

2078
05:52:41,090 --> 05:52:45,479
See what I mean?

2079
05:52:49,750 --> 05:52:51,270
That's fucking so stupid.

2080
05:52:51,990 --> 05:53:07,360
Here we go.

2081
05:53:07,360 --> 05:53:15,430
One, two, add to cart.

2082
05:53:16,709 --> 05:53:26,389
No, I think I've modded this.

2083
05:53:26,389 --> 05:53:29,270
I mean, like this just feels like it shouldn't ever be in the game.

2084
05:53:30,069 --> 05:53:40,560
It's a literal backflip because it's technically a kickflip.

2085
05:53:41,360 --> 05:53:53,299
Imagine not getting an actual 10 out of 10 for doing this.

2086
05:54:18,880 --> 05:54:19,360
Jesus.

2087
05:54:20,930 --> 05:54:21,569
All right, we're good.

2088
05:54:27,779 --> 05:54:32,259
It's called one, one B, one back.

2089
05:54:32,259 --> 05:54:35,159
No, one back.

2090
05:54:35,880 --> 05:54:36,360
Back one.

2091
05:54:48,069 --> 05:54:48,549
Back one.

2092
05:54:48,549 --> 05:54:49,189
That's what it is.

2093
05:54:53,319 --> 05:54:54,709
Boring.

2094
05:54:54,709 --> 05:54:56,470
It means to invent a funny name.

2095
05:54:57,990 --> 05:54:59,110
It's a backflip.

2096
05:54:59,110 --> 05:54:59,509
That's it.

2097
05:55:00,869 --> 05:55:03,060
What do you want me to call it?

2098
05:55:03,060 --> 05:55:04,900
Oh, the scoopity poopity.

2099
05:55:04,900 --> 05:55:06,180
It's a backflip.

2100
05:55:06,180 --> 05:55:06,580
That's it.

2101
05:55:08,400 --> 05:55:09,520
It's just a backflip.

2102
05:55:09,520 --> 05:55:19,360
Backspace.

2103
05:55:19,360 --> 05:55:20,680
I like backspace.

2104
05:55:38,119 --> 05:55:40,080
Capitalize the flip.

2105
05:55:44,759 --> 05:55:46,840
Okay, let's get out of here.

2106
05:55:47,639 --> 05:55:50,279
Edit tricks, flip tricks.

2107
05:55:51,000 --> 05:55:52,200
Here we go.

2108
05:55:52,200 --> 05:55:56,040
I'm going to put it on to this hard flip here.

2109
05:56:05,540 --> 05:56:24,400
You unsubbed because no scoopity poopity.

2110
05:56:24,400 --> 05:56:25,360
I'm so sorry.

2111
05:56:26,880 --> 05:56:28,470
All right, blimp.

2112
05:56:30,099 --> 05:56:31,700
Crazy ass fans.

2113
05:56:31,700 --> 05:56:34,180
Competition won't start until they're removed from the lights.

2114
05:56:38,709 --> 05:56:40,150
Fans are on the lights.

2115
05:56:40,150 --> 05:56:41,189
I have to use a blimp.

2116
05:56:42,150 --> 05:56:51,759
I'm killing it.

2117
05:56:52,959 --> 05:56:55,000
Blimp controls.

2118
05:56:55,959 --> 05:56:56,520
Celebrate.

2119
05:56:57,319 --> 05:56:59,110
How do I go up?

2120
05:56:59,909 --> 05:57:04,759
I don't think I can move it.

2121
05:57:04,759 --> 05:57:05,959
I think I can just go left and right.

2122
05:57:07,000 --> 05:57:42,599
Go up.

2123
05:57:42,599 --> 05:57:44,040
I just hit an invisible wall.

2124
05:57:45,159 --> 05:57:46,279
What is that, gang?

2125
05:57:47,159 --> 05:57:47,479
Come on.

2126
05:57:47,479 --> 05:57:49,080
You're supposed to be in 97 stuff.

2127
05:58:09,409 --> 05:58:09,810
Oh, yeah.

2128
05:58:12,560 --> 05:58:13,040
These balls.

2129
05:58:14,000 --> 05:58:18,720
Wow.

2130
05:58:19,520 --> 05:58:26,560
Oh, look at that.

2131
05:58:28,959 --> 05:58:29,599
So good.

2132
05:58:30,240 --> 05:58:30,959
So good.

2133
05:58:31,759 --> 05:58:35,459
Just standard jumps and standard kickflips.

2134
05:58:39,220 --> 05:58:39,540
Safe.

2135
05:58:41,090 --> 05:58:41,970
Nice, but safe.

2136
05:58:42,529 --> 05:58:47,520
Okay.

2137
05:58:47,520 --> 05:58:49,959
When are you going to be done?

2138
05:58:49,959 --> 05:58:54,229
He's actually pretty impressive.

2139
05:58:54,229 --> 05:58:54,869
He's still going.

2140
05:58:57,349 --> 05:58:59,110
He's still got this combo going.

2141
05:58:59,830 --> 05:59:01,270
I'm actually a little concerned now.

2142
05:59:01,270 --> 05:59:03,029
I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.

2143
05:59:04,080 --> 05:59:06,880
This is like five laps on the course.

2144
05:59:07,919 --> 05:59:08,840
There's A.

2145
05:59:10,279 --> 05:59:10,840
Oh, shit.

2146
05:59:22,400 --> 05:59:22,720
Find it.

2147
05:59:39,490 --> 05:59:39,810
Okay.

2148
05:59:39,810 --> 05:59:43,669
It's actually a little distracting.

2149
05:59:43,669 --> 05:59:44,790
I don't know if I like this.

2150
05:59:45,349 --> 06:00:15,729
I would take it off.

2151
06:00:15,729 --> 06:00:16,930
I don't like it.

2152
06:00:21,759 --> 06:00:24,799
It's super distracting and it's hard.

2153
06:00:24,799 --> 06:00:25,360
It's very...

2154
06:00:25,919 --> 06:00:27,840
It's kind of ruining my runs.

2155
06:00:28,479 --> 06:00:29,119
I can't take it off.

2156
06:01:13,430 --> 06:01:14,310
No, get it off.

2157
06:01:14,310 --> 06:01:14,790
Get it off.

2158
06:01:14,790 --> 06:01:15,349
Get it off.

2159
06:01:15,349 --> 06:01:15,990
Get it off.

2160
06:01:15,990 --> 06:01:16,470
Get it off.

2161
06:01:16,470 --> 06:01:17,509
I can't stand it.

2162
06:01:17,509 --> 06:01:19,720
It's too fucked up.

2163
06:01:19,720 --> 06:01:20,919
Get it off.

2164
06:01:20,919 --> 06:01:25,380
Put anything else.

2165
06:01:25,380 --> 06:01:26,500
I don't care what it is.

2166
06:01:26,500 --> 06:01:27,139
Get it off.

2167
06:01:27,139 --> 06:01:28,259
I don't want to see it anymore.

2168
06:01:29,330 --> 06:01:30,849
It's not going to happen.

2169
06:01:30,849 --> 06:01:34,709
We'll just do a varial heel flip there.

2170
06:01:34,709 --> 06:01:35,830
That sounds like a good one.

2171
06:01:38,869 --> 06:01:39,509
You know what I mean?

2172
06:01:39,509 --> 06:01:40,549
Like it's not...

2173
06:01:40,549 --> 06:01:42,389
My whole body isn't moving around.

2174
06:01:44,069 --> 06:01:53,040
Fuck you.

2175
06:01:53,040 --> 06:01:53,520
I had that.

2176
06:01:53,520 --> 06:02:23,509
Fuck off, Eric.

2177
06:02:23,509 --> 06:02:25,189
How's that fucking taste, Eric?

2178
06:02:56,659 --> 06:02:57,619
I'm a pro now.

2179
06:02:57,700 --> 06:03:09,680
Did he say bovine balls?

2180
06:03:10,639 --> 06:03:20,419
Create a deck.

2181
06:03:20,419 --> 06:03:21,139
Now that you're a pro,

2182
06:03:21,139 --> 06:03:23,700
you'll need to design your own pro deck graphic.

2183
06:03:27,400 --> 06:03:28,200
Base graphic.

2184
06:03:29,000 --> 06:04:05,189
No, the bricks.

2185
06:04:05,189 --> 06:04:25,279
Bricks.

2186
06:04:25,279 --> 06:04:40,759
Rock?

2187
06:04:55,349 --> 06:05:36,369
Really?

2188
06:05:41,270 --> 06:05:53,240
What?

2189
06:05:53,240 --> 06:05:53,799
Oh, no.

2190
06:05:54,360 --> 06:05:55,240
I can only have one of these?

2191
06:06:07,220 --> 06:06:07,619
Move it.

2192
06:06:08,180 --> 06:06:08,659
Here we go.

2193
06:06:08,659 --> 06:06:15,639
Okay, looks good.

2194
06:06:17,000 --> 06:06:18,389
Okay.

2195
06:06:18,950 --> 06:06:19,430
Another one.

2196
06:06:21,509 --> 06:06:27,119
I can only...

2197
06:06:27,119 --> 06:06:28,000
I can only have one.

2198
06:06:41,139 --> 06:06:41,700
Layer three.

2199
06:06:41,700 --> 06:06:49,459
Okay, great.

2200
06:06:49,459 --> 06:06:51,220
I could use four slot emotes.

2201
06:07:01,409 --> 06:07:23,540
Oh, well.

2202
06:07:24,919 --> 06:07:25,639
All right, I'm going to do...

2203
06:07:28,919 --> 06:07:29,799
I don't like any of these.

2204
06:07:29,799 --> 06:07:37,759
Maybe the fire?

2205
06:07:38,479 --> 06:07:55,279
I don't really want anything.

2206
06:07:56,400 --> 06:07:57,520
No, I don't want any graphics.

2207
06:07:59,360 --> 06:08:05,520
No graphics.

2208
06:08:05,520 --> 06:08:06,479
Layer two.

2209
06:08:06,479 --> 06:08:06,720
Layer...

2210
06:08:07,360 --> 06:08:08,240
Layer one.

2211
06:08:08,240 --> 06:08:08,880
Layer two.

2212
06:08:08,880 --> 06:08:09,360
Layer one.

2213
06:08:10,319 --> 06:08:15,520
Let's try this one more time.

2214
06:08:15,520 --> 06:08:16,159
There we go.

2215
06:08:20,319 --> 06:08:25,250
Like that.

2216
06:08:25,250 --> 06:08:26,209
Looks fucking good, dude.

2217
06:08:30,680 --> 06:08:31,080
All right.

2218
06:08:32,119 --> 06:08:39,220
The pizza stain board.

2219
06:08:40,419 --> 06:08:41,380
That board sucks.

2220
06:08:41,380 --> 06:08:41,939
No, it doesn't.

2221
06:08:41,939 --> 06:08:44,900
Hey, way to clean up in the slam city gym.

2222
06:08:44,900 --> 06:08:46,659
Heard you scored a pro model, too.

2223
06:08:47,939 --> 06:08:50,290
Well, I would have scored it sooner if Eric had...

2224
06:08:50,290 --> 06:08:50,689
It's brick.

2225
06:08:50,689 --> 06:08:52,770
It's brick with blood and stuff.

2226
06:08:52,770 --> 06:08:53,250
It looks like...

2227
06:08:58,950 --> 06:08:59,669
Pizza board.

2228
06:08:59,669 --> 06:09:03,319
You're just jealous Eric gets to go to Moscow instead of you.

2229
06:09:03,959 --> 06:09:06,919
I got more important things to worry about than Eric.

2230
06:09:06,919 --> 06:09:10,279
Like maybe you could help me shop for a house.

2231
06:09:10,279 --> 06:09:12,689
Nice work, guys.

2232
06:09:12,689 --> 06:09:14,130
I'll help you shop for a tent.

2233
06:09:14,130 --> 06:09:15,009
Nice job.

2234
06:09:15,009 --> 06:09:19,700
Look around the air and it'll land on somebody.

2235
06:09:19,700 --> 06:09:24,419
Yeah, but I see Kostin with his crazy Hollywood house and Tony with his Lexus.

2236
06:09:24,419 --> 06:09:27,139
Sponsors, man.

2237
06:09:27,139 --> 06:09:32,259
Even my sister knows that you have to have a signature shoe to make decent living from skating.

2238
06:09:33,380 --> 06:09:36,610
But hey, it looks like the sponsors are all hanging around town.

2239
06:09:36,610 --> 06:09:38,049
Why do they all just walk around town?

2240
06:09:39,169 --> 06:09:39,650
Who knows?

2241
06:09:39,650 --> 06:09:41,810
If you get a shoe deal, maybe they'll take you on tour.

2242
06:09:41,810 --> 06:09:44,770
Just the random NPC sponsors that are just in your city,

2243
06:09:44,770 --> 06:09:46,529
just walking around waiting to give you money.

2244
06:09:47,409 --> 06:09:55,270
Just do a cool trick.

2245
06:09:55,270 --> 06:09:56,549
Does this work for magicians, too?

2246
06:09:59,490 --> 06:09:59,810
Ditch.

2247
06:10:01,220 --> 06:10:02,419
Why can I ditch the car?

2248
06:10:03,220 --> 06:10:08,849
I can't ditch.

2249
06:10:16,450 --> 06:10:17,330
I'm a pro.

2250
06:10:17,330 --> 06:10:18,049
I have a limo.

2251
06:10:22,209 --> 06:10:23,009
Learn to drive.

2252
06:10:24,040 --> 06:10:25,319
Why have they spawned me here?

2253
06:10:35,200 --> 06:10:36,959
Driving your own limo.

2254
06:10:42,130 --> 06:10:42,689
Half pipe.

2255
06:10:43,330 --> 06:10:45,110
Nice trick.

2256
06:10:46,279 --> 06:10:47,319
All right, let's do something.

2257
06:10:48,770 --> 06:10:49,970
Show off your skills.

2258
06:10:50,770 --> 06:10:54,450
We need to see something edgy before we'll give you a shoe.

2259
06:10:54,450 --> 06:10:55,409
Tell you what.

2260
06:10:55,409 --> 06:10:58,529
Let's see you clear all the spines of Superior Court.

2261
06:10:58,529 --> 06:10:59,970
Where are the spines?

2262
06:10:59,970 --> 06:11:05,490
One, two, and three.

2263
06:11:09,009 --> 06:11:11,639
What do you mean by this?

2264
06:11:13,639 --> 06:11:17,200
You mean that counts, right?

2265
06:11:18,639 --> 06:11:26,549
Come on up here.

2266
06:11:27,509 --> 06:11:49,880
Restart.

2267
06:11:50,520 --> 06:11:50,680
No.

2268
06:11:51,799 --> 06:11:52,759
Get off the board and walk.

2269
06:11:53,479 --> 06:11:58,310
All right, come on.

2270
06:12:04,209 --> 06:12:05,490
The shoe guys are into me.

2271
06:12:05,490 --> 06:12:07,409
Todd says I'm on board for the next tour.

2272
06:12:08,450 --> 06:12:10,049
Dude, you're going to miss that bus.

2273
06:12:11,009 --> 06:12:11,569
What bus?

2274
06:12:12,290 --> 06:12:13,330
Your team bus.

2275
06:12:13,330 --> 06:12:15,090
Bro, they're going to Moscow.

2276
06:12:15,090 --> 06:12:15,490
What?

2277
06:12:15,490 --> 06:12:16,770
Oh, damn.

2278
06:12:16,770 --> 06:12:17,250
My shoes.

2279
06:12:17,250 --> 06:12:18,130
My shoes.

2280
06:12:18,130 --> 06:12:19,009
And my socks.

2281
06:12:19,009 --> 06:12:20,049
And my socks.

2282
06:12:21,169 --> 06:12:21,810
Go, dude.

2283
06:12:23,110 --> 06:12:25,189
My shoes and my socks.

2284
06:12:51,110 --> 06:12:52,709
Why am I doing tricks?

2285
06:12:52,709 --> 06:12:53,349
I don't know.

2286
06:12:53,349 --> 06:12:53,909
I don't know.

2287
06:12:53,909 --> 06:12:54,630
I just want to.

2288
06:13:03,200 --> 06:13:03,599
Thanks.

2289
06:13:05,040 --> 06:13:05,680
Son of a.

2290
06:13:05,680 --> 06:13:06,639
There goes my bus.

2291
06:13:06,639 --> 06:13:07,200
Son of a what?

2292
06:13:08,159 --> 06:13:09,409
What?

2293
06:13:09,409 --> 06:13:09,889
I need my.

2294
06:13:09,889 --> 06:13:11,970
No, I need my trophy.

2295
06:13:12,689 --> 06:13:14,369
Get your slam city trophy.

2296
06:13:15,409 --> 06:13:19,220
Excuse me.

2297
06:13:19,220 --> 06:13:19,540
I got to.

2298
06:13:20,340 --> 06:13:29,189
It's the bus, right?

2299
06:13:33,669 --> 06:13:33,909
What?

2300
06:13:34,549 --> 06:13:46,000
Do I have to beat the bus to Moscow?

2301
06:13:46,000 --> 06:13:49,729
Stop that bus.

2302
06:13:55,430 --> 06:13:55,909
I can't get.

2303
06:13:56,630 --> 06:13:59,000
Why didn't they break?

2304
06:13:59,799 --> 06:14:18,639
Oh, I just didn't get to the end.

2305
06:14:21,240 --> 06:14:22,520
I thought stop the bus.

2306
06:14:22,520 --> 06:14:24,119
I'm like, stand in front of it.

2307
06:14:24,919 --> 06:14:30,240
I didn't know that stop the bus meant

2308
06:14:30,799 --> 06:14:35,200
to skate over through the level out of the level.

2309
06:14:36,959 --> 06:14:38,080
Mother Russia.

2310
06:14:38,080 --> 06:14:42,159
Home of borscht, potatoes, and the world's biggest skate demo ever.

2311
06:14:42,159 --> 06:14:45,439
All the press will be here looking for this year's best new pro.

2312
06:14:45,439 --> 06:14:48,159
Now, the demo doesn't start for a few days, OK?

2313
06:14:48,159 --> 06:14:49,680
So stay the hell out of trouble.

2314
06:14:55,029 --> 06:14:56,630
Is this emulated or is it on console?

2315
06:14:56,630 --> 06:14:58,470
This is actually on console.

2316
06:14:59,430 --> 06:15:05,830
This is an Xbox 360 slim with an official Xbox 360 hard drive in it.

2317
06:15:05,830 --> 06:15:06,709
You have to have one of those.

2318
06:15:06,709 --> 06:15:07,750
Don't make the mistake I did.

2319
06:15:09,509 --> 06:15:12,470
And it's just the original disc for Xbox.

2320
06:15:14,869 --> 06:15:21,380
Welcome to Russia.

2321
06:15:22,340 --> 06:15:25,080
Hey, American.

2322
06:15:26,040 --> 06:15:31,159
Some nosy American company installed cameras on our buildings for this contest.

2323
06:15:32,279 --> 06:15:35,619
Cameras.

2324
06:15:37,060 --> 06:15:40,340
We Russians value privacy and would like them knocked out.

2325
06:15:40,340 --> 06:15:42,099
Why don't you do something?

2326
06:15:42,099 --> 06:15:43,139
I do favor for you.

2327
06:15:45,139 --> 06:15:46,259
I knocked on the cameras.

2328
06:15:48,900 --> 06:15:50,979
Don't say that you can't comprehend.

2329
06:15:50,979 --> 06:15:53,779
Don't say that you don't understand.

2330
06:15:53,779 --> 06:15:54,740
This is California.

2331
06:15:54,740 --> 06:16:00,950
I'm not saying that you can't understand.

2332
06:16:00,950 --> 06:16:03,430
Don't say that you can't understand.

2333
06:16:03,430 --> 06:16:04,310
This is California.

2334
06:16:04,310 --> 06:16:11,090
Don't say that you can't comprehend.

2335
06:16:11,090 --> 06:16:14,790
How many are there?

2336
06:16:23,060 --> 06:16:31,680
I guess it's just got to stay on the grind.

2337
06:16:43,380 --> 06:16:44,340
Oh, it's up there.

2338
06:16:44,340 --> 06:16:44,900
Holy shit.

2339
06:16:46,389 --> 06:16:46,790
Damn.

2340
06:16:46,790 --> 06:16:47,509
How do I get up there?

2341
06:16:53,830 --> 06:16:55,360
Is that your wall ride?

2342
06:16:56,159 --> 06:17:03,750
Don't say that you don't understand.

2343
06:17:03,750 --> 06:17:13,860
Don't say that you don't understand.

2344
06:17:13,860 --> 06:17:21,250
That you don't understand.

2345
06:17:21,250 --> 06:17:21,750
Shit.

2346
06:17:22,770 --> 06:17:28,950
There it is.

2347
06:17:29,729 --> 06:17:30,610
But not quite.

2348
06:17:30,610 --> 06:17:31,650
I didn't get the other one below it.

2349
06:17:32,610 --> 06:17:33,110
Wait.

2350
06:17:34,880 --> 06:17:35,380
Did I?

2351
06:17:36,560 --> 06:17:45,830
Okay.

2352
06:17:45,830 --> 06:17:46,069
Yep.

2353
06:17:46,069 --> 06:17:46,389
I see it.

2354
06:17:46,389 --> 06:17:46,869
I see it.

2355
06:17:46,869 --> 06:17:48,470
It's right after that.

2356
06:17:48,470 --> 06:17:58,580
I'm going to go up.

2357
06:17:59,459 --> 06:18:07,500
There it is.

2358
06:18:08,919 --> 06:18:10,639
There's more here.

2359
06:18:12,560 --> 06:18:13,680
I thought that was going to be the end.

2360
06:18:14,479 --> 06:18:15,360
That's not the end.

2361
06:18:16,639 --> 06:18:17,040
Fuck.

2362
06:18:17,040 --> 06:18:17,759
That's not the end.

2363
06:18:17,759 --> 06:18:18,479
I got to keep going.

2364
06:18:18,479 --> 06:18:19,200
It's one line.

2365
06:18:19,200 --> 06:18:19,840
Holy shit.

2366
06:18:39,590 --> 06:18:42,959
Sorry.

2367
06:18:42,959 --> 06:18:43,279
I got to...

2368
06:18:47,409 --> 06:18:51,680
How do I get up from this without...

2369
06:18:51,680 --> 06:18:52,319
Can I just...

2370
06:18:52,319 --> 06:18:52,819
Hold on.

2371
06:18:54,500 --> 06:18:55,000
Fuck.

2372
06:18:55,619 --> 06:18:57,139
Just get off the board and just punch it.

2373
06:18:59,060 --> 06:19:00,639
This one's fucking hard.

2374
06:19:01,439 --> 06:19:12,490
There it is.

2375
06:19:13,270 --> 06:19:13,770
Got it.

2376
06:19:14,229 --> 06:19:15,040
There's more?

2377
06:19:15,040 --> 06:19:15,540
No.

2378
06:19:15,919 --> 06:19:17,639
Okay.

2379
06:19:17,639 --> 06:19:18,139
There we go.

2380
06:19:22,880 --> 06:19:23,119
What?

2381
06:19:23,119 --> 06:19:23,439
Whoa.

2382
06:19:23,439 --> 06:19:23,919
What?

2383
06:19:23,919 --> 06:19:24,560
What?

2384
06:19:24,560 --> 06:19:24,959
Where?

2385
06:19:24,959 --> 06:19:25,200
What?

2386
06:19:25,200 --> 06:19:26,400
Wait.

2387
06:19:26,400 --> 06:19:27,040
What?

2388
06:19:27,040 --> 06:19:28,240
There's another more.

2389
06:19:28,959 --> 06:19:30,000
Didn't it say completed?

2390
06:19:30,880 --> 06:19:32,470
Wait.

2391
06:19:32,470 --> 06:19:33,430
What was the green?

2392
06:19:34,229 --> 06:19:34,549
Oh.

2393
06:19:34,549 --> 06:19:34,950
Okay.

2394
06:19:34,950 --> 06:19:36,310
I saw like the big green green.

2395
06:19:36,310 --> 06:19:36,709
Like, okay.

2396
06:19:36,709 --> 06:19:37,270
And I looked over.

2397
06:19:37,270 --> 06:19:38,069
I was just done.

2398
06:19:38,069 --> 06:19:44,419
I thought that was it.

2399
06:19:44,419 --> 06:19:44,900
I thought...

2400
06:19:44,900 --> 06:19:46,020
I just saw the big green text.

2401
06:19:46,020 --> 06:19:46,500
I'm like, all right.

2402
06:19:46,500 --> 06:19:47,139
There's the line.

2403
06:19:59,939 --> 06:20:13,159
Fucking kidding me.

2404
06:20:15,250 --> 06:20:15,750
What?

2405
06:20:16,369 --> 06:20:16,930
Where is it?

2406
06:20:21,110 --> 06:20:24,310
Holy shit, dude.

2407
06:20:25,430 --> 06:20:26,470
What's the transfer here?

2408
06:20:32,680 --> 06:20:33,479
I don't see the transfer.

2409
06:20:34,279 --> 06:20:55,540
Got it.

2410
06:20:55,540 --> 06:20:56,259
Holy fuck.

2411
06:20:56,259 --> 06:20:56,759
Okay.

2412
06:20:57,540 --> 06:20:58,759
That one was fucking hard.

2413
06:21:26,599 --> 06:21:27,909
Caveman grind?

2414
06:21:30,599 --> 06:21:32,759
Well, I'm going to lose 400 rubles

2415
06:21:32,759 --> 06:21:34,279
because I don't know what a caveman grind is.

2416
06:21:34,520 --> 06:21:35,479
That's a caveman grind.

2417
06:21:38,720 --> 06:21:39,759
Just jumping off?

2418
06:21:48,549 --> 06:21:49,029
Like with a...

2419
06:21:50,150 --> 06:21:50,630
I don't know.

2420
06:21:50,630 --> 06:21:53,080
A caveman is you just don't need to put the board back on.

2421
06:21:54,040 --> 06:21:54,520
Like that.

2422
06:21:54,520 --> 06:21:55,080
Like that.

2423
06:21:58,709 --> 06:22:01,939
I don't know.

2424
06:22:01,939 --> 06:22:02,180
Stop.

2425
06:22:02,180 --> 06:22:02,740
Please.

2426
06:22:13,299 --> 06:22:14,979
Why is this the hardest thing so far?

2427
06:22:16,099 --> 06:22:16,979
Caveman attempt...

2428
06:22:16,979 --> 06:22:25,119
Oh.

2429
06:22:25,119 --> 06:22:29,279
Caveman attempt in a 20,000 point combo.

2430
06:22:30,689 --> 06:22:32,689
They said fuck this mission, by the way.

2431
06:22:32,689 --> 06:22:33,009
Really?

2432
06:22:34,209 --> 06:22:38,610
I...

2433
06:22:38,610 --> 06:22:38,849
What?

2434
06:22:41,810 --> 06:22:47,680
Fuck.

2435
06:22:50,000 --> 06:23:04,310
Fuck.

2436
06:23:04,310 --> 06:23:04,790
Ah.

2437
06:23:04,790 --> 06:23:05,590
My hands are sweating.

2438
06:23:10,279 --> 06:23:10,599
Nope.

2439
06:23:11,639 --> 06:23:14,740
I'm losing all my ruffles.

2440
06:23:14,740 --> 06:23:15,060
I know.

2441
06:23:16,180 --> 06:23:22,819
It's actually very, very hard to control the character when you're...

2442
06:23:22,819 --> 06:23:25,299
Standing on the tank, your movement changes.

2443
06:23:26,180 --> 06:23:26,979
Like I'm holding...

2444
06:23:27,939 --> 06:23:28,979
It's just weird.

2445
06:23:28,979 --> 06:23:30,099
It's almost like the character's...

2446
06:23:30,099 --> 06:23:31,380
See, I'm like holding the buttons down.

2447
06:23:31,380 --> 06:23:32,419
I'm like not running anymore.

2448
06:23:32,419 --> 06:23:33,139
It's kind of odd.

2449
06:23:33,139 --> 06:23:34,099
I'm just walking instead.

2450
06:23:35,380 --> 06:23:36,740
It's weird.

2451
06:23:38,259 --> 06:23:41,590
It's like I'm walking in quicksand right now.

2452
06:23:42,310 --> 06:23:48,659
20,000 points.

2453
06:23:48,659 --> 06:23:49,139
I can do it.

2454
06:23:50,340 --> 06:24:06,720
Fuck.

2455
06:24:06,720 --> 06:24:06,959
All right.

2456
06:24:06,959 --> 06:24:09,360
Now I understand what somebody said when they said fuck this mission.

2457
06:24:10,240 --> 06:24:11,360
Now I get what you're saying.

2458
06:24:12,080 --> 06:24:23,569
Did I get it?

2459
06:24:26,720 --> 06:24:27,759
What about the other one?

2460
06:24:27,759 --> 06:24:28,799
This one here.

2461
06:24:28,799 --> 06:24:29,840
This one's firing.

2462
06:24:30,720 --> 06:24:37,299
Fuck.

2463
06:24:37,939 --> 06:24:41,139
There's a much better line here.

2464
06:24:42,689 --> 06:24:44,049
There's nothing over off that one.

2465
06:24:54,099 --> 06:24:55,220
That was only 15.

2466
06:24:55,220 --> 06:24:55,540
Fuck.

2467
06:25:10,240 --> 06:25:15,110
Damn it.

2468
06:25:15,669 --> 06:25:17,029
I'm starting to become greasy again.

2469
06:25:17,669 --> 06:25:22,419
Can caveman any part of the tank?

2470
06:25:23,299 --> 06:25:24,259
Are you fucking serious?

2471
06:25:26,389 --> 06:25:28,229
Why am I doing the hardest part?

2472
06:25:31,200 --> 06:25:31,919
What?

2473
06:25:31,919 --> 06:25:32,720
No, I can't.

2474
06:25:33,439 --> 06:25:34,880
Oh, come on.

2475
06:25:34,880 --> 06:25:37,040
Why is my brain so strange?

2476
06:25:37,919 --> 06:25:41,759
Oh, I got a caveman up the nose of the tank.

2477
06:25:41,759 --> 06:25:42,720
Oh, my God.

2478
06:25:43,279 --> 06:25:44,720
What a waste of fucking time.

2479
06:25:47,459 --> 06:25:48,659
Good duo combo.

2480
06:26:22,369 --> 06:26:24,130
He's gotta get something going and then run back.

2481
06:26:24,369 --> 06:26:35,520
Because it keeps your combo when you run off like that.

2482
06:26:39,599 --> 06:26:42,840
All right, here we go.

2483
06:26:46,200 --> 06:26:46,520
That's it.

2484
06:26:48,680 --> 06:26:51,720
Why would I caveman first when I can just get off the cater?

2485
06:26:52,520 --> 06:26:59,330
You just have to have done a caveman at some point in the combo.

2486
06:26:59,330 --> 06:27:02,209
So I might as well do the combo first and then just do the caveman

2487
06:27:02,209 --> 06:27:03,889
because it's easier because I can just get off the fucking

2488
06:27:04,610 --> 06:27:05,009
scooter.

2489
06:27:07,970 --> 06:27:10,930
If you're in the middle of a combo and you get off the skateboard,

2490
06:27:11,729 --> 06:27:16,529
you have like five seconds with the combo meter still going.

2491
06:27:28,799 --> 06:27:36,439
Okay, that's special over here.

2492
06:27:36,439 --> 06:27:37,319
Why do I need special?

2493
06:27:39,639 --> 06:27:41,080
Get special and some speed first.

2494
06:27:42,919 --> 06:27:47,479
Okay, now over the wall.

2495
06:27:48,840 --> 06:27:49,479
Over this wall.

2496
06:27:53,080 --> 06:27:53,560
Behind you.

2497
06:27:55,080 --> 06:27:59,459
Special makes you faster for some reason.

2498
06:27:59,459 --> 06:27:59,939
Does it really?

2499
06:28:01,700 --> 06:28:04,259
All right, let me get some speed.

2500
06:28:32,450 --> 06:28:35,009
I'm not going forward.

2501
06:28:35,009 --> 06:28:43,810
I'm going to be going forward.

2502
06:29:01,009 --> 06:29:03,009
Are we sneaking into the Kremlin right now?

2503
06:29:03,009 --> 06:29:03,810
What are we doing?

2504
06:29:05,889 --> 06:29:09,810
Uh, Operation D's what?

2505
06:29:17,009 --> 06:29:18,290
Oh my god, really?

2506
06:29:19,650 --> 06:29:32,159
I can't believe we just got a D's nut kill.

2507
06:29:33,840 --> 06:29:37,189
Two more.

2508
06:29:39,880 --> 06:29:40,200
Hello.

2509
06:29:41,560 --> 06:29:43,479
That was some damn sweet kung fu.

2510
06:29:44,919 --> 06:29:46,200
One last thing to do.

2511
06:29:46,200 --> 06:29:48,279
Bam never has any clothes on.

2512
06:29:48,279 --> 06:29:48,599
Why?

2513
06:29:49,959 --> 06:29:51,799
Get up that ladder and ring those bells.

2514
06:29:51,959 --> 06:29:52,599
Easy.

2515
06:29:54,479 --> 06:29:56,799
We think the guards will run out and open the gate.

2516
06:29:56,799 --> 06:29:58,240
Yeah, it's a long shot.

2517
06:29:58,240 --> 06:29:58,720
Oh, yeah.

2518
06:29:59,599 --> 06:30:00,479
Don't get shot.

2519
06:30:02,000 --> 06:30:02,720
Ring the bell.

2520
06:30:04,080 --> 06:30:04,959
Ring the bells.

2521
06:30:12,919 --> 06:30:14,119
Um, oh god.

2522
06:30:15,970 --> 06:30:16,450
Caveman.

2523
06:30:27,810 --> 06:30:28,290
Trekkin' along.

2524
06:30:34,759 --> 06:30:35,639
Tanks.

2525
06:30:35,639 --> 06:30:37,729
A tank.

2526
06:30:37,729 --> 06:30:38,770
Look at these tanks.

2527
06:30:39,810 --> 06:30:41,009
Damn, look at these tanks.

2528
06:30:41,810 --> 06:30:43,090
It's probably pretty cold out here.

2529
06:30:43,090 --> 06:30:44,529
She's stoked by getting best new pro.

2530
06:30:45,409 --> 06:30:47,490
Well, it's not a done deal yet.

2531
06:30:47,490 --> 06:30:49,169
It's pretty close between me and Eric.

2532
06:30:50,369 --> 06:30:51,490
Sup, guys?

2533
06:30:52,610 --> 06:30:55,090
Listen, I've been thinking, we can't keep this up.

2534
06:30:55,090 --> 06:30:57,009
Remember how I used to torch action figures with you?

2535
06:30:57,650 --> 06:30:58,529
I acted like a dork.

2536
06:30:58,529 --> 06:30:59,729
I'm sorry, I got carried away.

2537
06:31:05,970 --> 06:31:08,770
No, we're going to get, we're going to get fucking double-crossed again.

2538
06:31:08,770 --> 06:31:10,529
Get out in front of those cameras and earn your keep.

2539
06:31:12,610 --> 06:31:13,330
So good.

2540
06:31:13,330 --> 06:31:15,009
We can't go skating right now.

2541
06:31:15,009 --> 06:31:16,770
Look at these tanks.

2542
06:31:16,770 --> 06:31:17,270
Damn.

2543
06:31:18,229 --> 06:31:20,540
Chapter 21.

2544
06:31:20,540 --> 06:31:21,900
Time to skate, comrade.

2545
06:31:23,959 --> 06:31:25,000
Christmas in Moscow?

2546
06:31:35,049 --> 06:31:37,369
Manuals for Moscovites.

2547
06:31:37,369 --> 06:31:38,569
Rodney Mullin.

2548
06:31:38,569 --> 06:31:40,650
Why are you hanging out here freezing your ass off?

2549
06:31:43,529 --> 06:31:44,569
I was waiting for it.

2550
06:31:44,569 --> 06:31:46,729
Somebody just went, what the fuck?

2551
06:31:50,099 --> 06:31:52,659
I know we've done that a lot tonight, but it's funny every time

2552
06:31:52,659 --> 06:31:54,900
because there's new people that experience it every time.

2553
06:31:57,270 --> 06:31:58,709
That's what makes it so much better.

2554
06:32:02,950 --> 06:32:03,669
Around to get more.

2555
06:32:07,819 --> 06:32:08,540
Manuals.

2556
06:32:16,779 --> 06:32:18,939
Should we be concerned about tanks pointing at us?

2557
06:32:31,369 --> 06:32:31,869
More.

2558
06:32:31,869 --> 06:32:38,459
Oh, that was broken, but okay.

2559
06:32:48,430 --> 06:32:52,080
I'm going to get blasted with a tank shell.

2560
06:32:55,799 --> 06:33:01,720
That would be, that would be, uh, Tony Hawk, what do you need?

2561
06:33:02,360 --> 06:33:02,860
Russia.

2562
06:33:03,319 --> 06:33:04,680
Cool, eh, comrade?

2563
06:33:04,680 --> 06:33:07,080
The locals are stoked on this chick I've been working on up here.

2564
06:33:08,599 --> 06:33:10,669
I'll tell you what, you give it a try.

2565
06:33:10,669 --> 06:33:12,909
Land tricks until you get your special meter full

2566
06:33:12,909 --> 06:33:14,830
and then do a 360 burial heel flip lean.

2567
06:33:16,270 --> 06:33:18,830
Okay, thanks, Tony.

2568
06:33:27,389 --> 06:33:28,029
Special move.

2569
06:33:29,799 --> 06:33:31,000
I'm not doing the flush.

2570
06:33:31,000 --> 06:33:33,560
We can't pull out the flush every five seconds.

2571
06:33:35,799 --> 06:33:37,959
It loses its comedic value if you do it.

2572
06:33:39,720 --> 06:33:41,720
So,

2573
06:33:52,240 --> 06:33:54,560
show me how well you know Moscow.

2574
06:33:54,560 --> 06:33:57,759
Oh, no, some gaps and you might get jobs later.

2575
06:33:57,759 --> 06:33:59,119
Too much media around here.

2576
06:33:59,119 --> 06:34:00,000
Find some gaps.

2577
06:34:01,279 --> 06:34:02,799
Find five gaps.

2578
06:34:08,650 --> 06:34:10,009
Three and a half minutes to do this.

2579
06:34:11,819 --> 06:34:12,459
Is this a gap?

2580
06:34:13,419 --> 06:34:18,860
That's kind of a gap.

2581
06:34:47,290 --> 06:34:47,849
Hey there.

2582
06:34:48,409 --> 06:34:50,090
Why are these reporters bugging you?

2583
06:34:50,889 --> 06:34:54,810
I feel like I'll be searching around for like 20 minutes.

2584
06:34:58,830 --> 06:34:59,630
I don't want to do that one.

2585
06:35:08,520 --> 06:35:10,119
Do they not have animated eyes?

2586
06:35:10,119 --> 06:35:10,840
Look at her eyes.

2587
06:35:13,759 --> 06:35:14,479
More manuals?

2588
06:35:14,479 --> 06:35:16,560
Get a 20,000 point manual combo.

2589
06:35:17,680 --> 06:35:17,919
Easy.

2590
06:35:26,479 --> 06:35:28,639
That's the easiest thing I've done all night.

2591
06:35:28,639 --> 06:35:30,959
If there were not so many reporters watching,

2592
06:35:30,959 --> 06:35:32,720
I'd show you some tricks too.

2593
06:35:32,720 --> 06:35:33,279
Bye-bye.

2594
06:35:38,240 --> 06:35:39,520
Oh, I like that pipe.

2595
06:35:39,520 --> 06:35:40,159
Let me try that.

2596
06:35:42,439 --> 06:35:42,840
Nice.

2597
06:35:51,159 --> 06:35:52,040
Pretty solid.

2598
06:35:52,599 --> 06:35:53,400
95,000.

2599
06:35:53,400 --> 06:36:01,450
For me, anything more than one to 200,000 is like,

2600
06:36:01,450 --> 06:36:03,209
all right, that was pretty good.

2601
06:36:04,490 --> 06:36:07,930
I know some of you guys are pros, but you know, I'm me.

2602
06:36:13,979 --> 06:36:14,459
Warm up.

2603
06:36:26,569 --> 06:36:28,090
Why is this guy talking like a sham?

2604
06:36:28,090 --> 06:36:28,490
Wow, dude.

2605
06:36:30,009 --> 06:36:30,250
Cool.

2606
06:36:33,759 --> 06:36:34,799
50,000 points.

2607
06:36:35,680 --> 06:36:36,400
I could do better.

2608
06:36:46,509 --> 06:36:48,029
Do I still have that on my bar?

2609
06:37:06,330 --> 06:37:07,450
Yeah, it's still on the bar.

2610
06:37:07,450 --> 06:37:08,330
It's still on my bar.

2611
06:37:08,889 --> 06:37:11,369
Yes, I'm using MMO terms right now,

2612
06:37:11,369 --> 06:37:12,250
but you know what I'm saying.

2613
06:37:30,810 --> 06:37:31,930
Where's the DPS?

2614
06:37:32,970 --> 06:37:36,360
I only have to do one more thing.

2615
06:37:38,279 --> 06:37:39,319
Ratings, stunts.

2616
06:37:40,040 --> 06:37:41,799
I want you to get some air time.

2617
06:37:41,799 --> 06:37:44,279
It should be easy with all the reporters around.

2618
06:37:44,279 --> 06:37:46,840
Try to score big points around them while they're broadcasting.

2619
06:37:48,119 --> 06:37:53,150
Unreal TV is doing a story under Lenin's statue

2620
06:37:53,150 --> 06:37:55,709
about him coming back to life as a robot.

2621
06:37:55,709 --> 06:37:58,990
NSBC is doing a corruption story near St. Basil.

2622
06:37:58,990 --> 06:38:00,669
I'm gonna do crazy shit over here, right?

2623
06:38:00,669 --> 06:38:01,549
On each one of these.

2624
06:38:01,549 --> 06:38:04,509
After that, Channel 9 is interviewing some actress

2625
06:38:04,509 --> 06:38:05,709
in front of the armory.

2626
06:38:05,709 --> 06:38:07,310
Now go rip it up at those spots,

2627
06:38:07,310 --> 06:38:09,150
and you're bound to get on TV.

2628
06:38:10,750 --> 06:38:12,430
Okay, all right.

2629
06:38:14,540 --> 06:38:15,659
State Lenin's statue.

2630
06:38:15,659 --> 06:38:16,380
Oh, you are on camera.

2631
06:38:17,259 --> 06:38:23,099
Sorry, I got 16,000.

2632
06:38:27,450 --> 06:38:28,250
Yes, all right.

2633
06:38:28,250 --> 06:38:30,169
I don't really like the scan lines all over my screen.

2634
06:38:39,979 --> 06:38:41,740
All right, I just destroyed that.

2635
06:38:53,869 --> 06:38:55,229
Is it possible that you could create a character

2636
06:38:55,229 --> 06:38:55,869
that looks normal?

2637
06:38:58,189 --> 06:38:59,069
What's the fun in that, though?

2638
06:39:01,229 --> 06:39:02,189
What's the fun in that?

2639
06:39:02,830 --> 06:39:04,909
Get 10,000 in double tricks.

2640
06:39:06,110 --> 06:39:11,040
This is like broke out of the glass.

2641
06:39:13,400 --> 06:39:14,840
Wait, does he do that, too?

2642
06:39:15,400 --> 06:39:33,290
All right, we just did that.

2643
06:39:38,540 --> 06:39:39,259
Am I holding him?

2644
06:39:39,900 --> 06:39:53,580
Why am I doing these?

2645
06:39:54,139 --> 06:39:54,860
I feel like these are...

2646
06:39:56,060 --> 06:39:58,540
The points are much easier to attain here.

2647
06:40:06,840 --> 06:40:08,439
He did not do any of that correctly.

2648
06:40:08,439 --> 06:40:09,000
Well, yeah, I did.

2649
06:40:09,000 --> 06:40:11,400
I just had to get points when he was getting points, too.

2650
06:40:11,400 --> 06:40:12,759
We got points together at the same time.

2651
06:40:12,759 --> 06:40:13,319
Double points.

2652
06:40:30,159 --> 06:40:34,599
Did they put a tank level in Tony Hawk?

2653
06:40:36,439 --> 06:40:38,119
I will be shocked if this is the case.

2654
06:40:44,840 --> 06:40:55,790
This is not a dude stop it scenario.

2655
06:40:56,909 --> 06:41:10,639
It's not like somebody throwing TP.

2656
06:41:11,599 --> 06:41:12,799
Like a Halloween prank.

2657
06:41:13,919 --> 06:41:16,000
This is driving a tank into a building.

2658
06:41:26,009 --> 06:41:33,400
I missed the competition, is that what happened?

2659
06:41:38,840 --> 06:41:39,720
God damn it, Eric.

2660
06:41:52,279 --> 06:41:53,799
Get the check from the parents.

2661
06:41:53,799 --> 06:41:54,840
The kid's off the team.

2662
06:41:59,479 --> 06:42:01,959
You are very lucky your embassy has freed you.

2663
06:42:01,959 --> 06:42:05,080
Too bad your team has left you here to rot all by yourself, eh?

2664
06:42:05,639 --> 06:42:07,240
Good luck finding a way home.

2665
06:42:10,680 --> 06:42:14,360
Okay, I'm now stuck in Moscow.

2666
06:42:21,869 --> 06:42:24,029
The first thing I do when I get out, I don't call my mom.

2667
06:42:24,990 --> 06:42:26,430
I do a manual combo.

2668
06:42:28,110 --> 06:42:29,470
All right, how do I get out of here?

2669
06:42:48,970 --> 06:42:49,770
How do I activate?

2670
06:42:56,490 --> 06:42:57,290
What do we got for goals?

2671
06:42:59,500 --> 06:43:01,180
An anonymous caller.

2672
06:43:21,610 --> 06:43:23,799
That was him on the phone.

2673
06:43:23,799 --> 06:43:45,630
Oh boy, that was bad all the way around.

2674
06:43:45,630 --> 06:43:52,400
I'm supposed to take it off a bar and I can't.

2675
06:43:53,040 --> 06:44:12,569
I think that's how you play a game like this.

2676
06:44:12,650 --> 06:44:16,009
You just get so, you get so perfectionist.

2677
06:44:16,009 --> 06:44:18,330
You just want to do everything so good and so perfect

2678
06:44:18,330 --> 06:44:19,529
and then you do it wrong even a little bit.

2679
06:44:19,529 --> 06:44:21,130
You're like, no, no, no, do it again, do it again, do it again.

2680
06:44:21,130 --> 06:44:22,090
I don't want to, no, do it again, do it again.

2681
06:44:43,720 --> 06:44:44,520
Stop doing tricks.

2682
06:44:45,479 --> 06:44:49,200
It's like going to McDonald's and somebody's in the backseat going,

2683
06:44:49,200 --> 06:44:51,279
just don't, don't eat any hamburger.

2684
06:45:07,040 --> 06:45:07,840
Order a salad.

2685
06:45:13,840 --> 06:45:17,279
The electromagnetic forces you create will disable the tower.

2686
06:45:19,279 --> 06:45:20,400
Spins over the roof.

2687
06:45:27,639 --> 06:45:30,919
All right, got to go over 15 spins.

2688
06:45:43,319 --> 06:45:45,479
Holy shit, I feel like this is going to be hell.

2689
06:45:49,720 --> 06:45:55,610
Is this the only one I have to do it to?

2690
06:45:55,610 --> 06:45:56,650
Or are they all over the place?

2691
06:46:03,049 --> 06:46:04,169
Wait, let me get off the board.

2692
06:46:04,169 --> 06:46:05,849
Is there more than one or is it just these two?

2693
06:46:07,290 --> 06:46:08,250
It's just these two, huh?

2694
06:46:11,049 --> 06:46:13,610
15 full spins with spine transfer.

2695
06:46:19,369 --> 06:46:20,990
Do the flush.

2696
06:46:20,990 --> 06:46:21,790
I don't think that counts.

2697
06:46:26,330 --> 06:46:27,130
Why did it go the other way?

2698
06:46:29,770 --> 06:46:31,209
See, like why is it doing that?

2699
06:46:31,290 --> 06:46:31,770
What are you doing?

2700
06:46:43,840 --> 06:46:46,319
Yeah, all right, I got to, I got to go straight because this is just

2701
06:46:46,319 --> 06:46:48,159
such a small disorienting area.

2702
06:46:48,880 --> 06:46:50,639
They, they say, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2703
06:46:52,810 --> 06:46:56,729
Back and forth, back and forth, straight over.

2704
06:46:57,930 --> 06:46:58,569
Oh, God.

2705
06:46:59,529 --> 06:47:06,319
Flush is going to save you.

2706
06:47:06,319 --> 06:47:09,599
No, it's, it's not, it's actually 360 spins.

2707
06:47:09,599 --> 06:47:10,159
Watch, ready?

2708
06:47:10,159 --> 06:47:10,880
It's not what you think.

2709
06:47:13,360 --> 06:47:14,400
It's not what you think.

2710
06:47:15,919 --> 06:47:22,939
I have to use the analog here because that's going to keep happening.

2711
06:47:23,900 --> 06:47:34,619
15 fucking times.

2712
06:47:46,400 --> 06:47:48,000
Watch, watch.

2713
06:47:48,000 --> 06:47:50,959
It's going to be hard to do it.

2714
06:47:50,959 --> 06:47:51,599
Trust me.

2715
06:47:53,119 --> 06:47:55,520
It's not going to do what you think it is.

2716
06:48:02,840 --> 06:48:06,200
Spining over and then down, down, B is actually fucking hard to do.

2717
06:48:06,840 --> 06:48:23,319
It's rough.

2718
06:48:24,279 --> 06:48:27,849
All right.

2719
06:48:27,849 --> 06:48:29,560
No, no, that's not even the controller.

2720
06:48:29,560 --> 06:48:41,150
He's spinning back.

2721
06:48:41,150 --> 06:48:49,840
Why is he going the other way when I go to more than 540 goes the other way?

2722
06:48:50,959 --> 06:48:52,159
I don't know why it's happening.

2723
06:48:52,159 --> 06:48:52,880
That shouldn't be happening.

2724
06:48:53,919 --> 06:48:56,000
See what the fuck was, what is going on there?

2725
06:48:56,000 --> 06:48:56,560
Why is that happening?

2726
06:48:57,439 --> 06:49:02,540
What is it?

2727
06:49:02,540 --> 06:49:03,020
Why is it doing that?

2728
06:49:03,819 --> 06:49:04,779
What the fuck?

2729
06:49:04,779 --> 06:49:06,939
That something weird is going on here.

2730
06:49:06,939 --> 06:49:12,000
Something weird going on here.

2731
06:49:16,200 --> 06:49:16,759
One more try.

2732
06:49:16,759 --> 06:49:19,360
I don't want to do this one.

2733
06:49:19,360 --> 06:49:29,919
This one.

2734
06:49:29,919 --> 06:49:31,840
I have to do it.

2735
06:49:31,840 --> 06:49:32,479
I have to do it.

2736
06:49:34,889 --> 06:49:35,849
Have to do three of them all.

2737
06:49:35,849 --> 06:49:40,720
I'm not holding the triggers.

2738
06:49:40,720 --> 06:49:43,040
I have to hold the triggers to go over the.

2739
06:49:43,040 --> 06:49:43,759
Is that what's happening?

2740
06:49:43,759 --> 06:49:47,599
Because I have to hold both triggers to go over the satellites.

2741
06:49:47,599 --> 06:49:49,840
So I have to be holding them in the first place.

2742
06:49:58,560 --> 06:49:59,439
Wait, I don't have to hold them.

2743
06:49:59,439 --> 06:50:00,880
I just tap them.

2744
06:50:05,500 --> 06:50:06,779
Where's my clothes?

2745
06:50:06,779 --> 06:50:07,500
Why am I naked?

2746
06:50:21,369 --> 06:50:22,090
Pick the boss up.

2747
06:50:27,130 --> 06:50:27,930
Arrow freaked me out.

2748
06:50:32,970 --> 06:50:34,729
A lot of random car levels.

2749
06:50:35,450 --> 06:50:39,880
Is that him?

2750
06:50:44,439 --> 06:50:45,080
That was weird.

2751
06:50:46,090 --> 06:50:46,569
Do it again.

2752
06:50:49,709 --> 06:50:50,509
Boston band?

2753
06:50:50,509 --> 06:50:50,990
Yeah, it is.

2754
06:51:06,680 --> 06:51:14,220
It should be.

2755
06:51:20,669 --> 06:51:21,790
Where's this arrow going?

2756
06:51:22,750 --> 06:51:31,240
Do a royal flush with the car.

2757
06:51:31,240 --> 06:51:31,720
I can't.

2758
06:51:48,680 --> 06:52:01,439
Earn.

2759
06:52:01,439 --> 06:52:04,319
I, crazily enough, I didn't hit anybody.

2760
06:52:10,919 --> 06:52:11,959
Nobody got injured there.

2761
06:52:12,520 --> 06:52:13,419
I was fine.

2762
06:52:21,340 --> 06:52:21,979
Go get her.

2763
06:52:21,979 --> 06:52:22,299
Okay.

2764
06:52:29,279 --> 06:52:30,799
Simpsons hit and run all over again.

2765
06:52:31,360 --> 06:52:35,549
Even the timer is similar.

2766
06:52:37,290 --> 06:52:37,930
Jesus.

2767
06:52:37,930 --> 06:52:39,049
There's another person.

2768
06:52:52,080 --> 06:53:01,400
What?

2769
06:53:01,400 --> 06:53:01,900
Rita?

2770
06:53:04,909 --> 06:53:06,349
Lariska called for a ride.

2771
06:53:10,520 --> 06:53:12,520
Can't you guys all be in the same spot?

2772
06:53:30,459 --> 06:53:32,360
All right.

2773
06:53:33,080 --> 06:53:36,590
I'm going for this one again.

2774
06:53:40,330 --> 06:53:40,810
Here we go.

2775
06:53:42,970 --> 06:53:43,310
Hike.

2776
06:54:01,000 --> 06:54:07,400
Oh, God.

2777
06:54:28,970 --> 06:54:29,610
Okay.

2778
06:54:29,610 --> 06:54:30,409
Now let's try this again.

2779
06:54:32,169 --> 06:54:33,049
Failed when walking.

2780
06:54:33,049 --> 06:54:33,930
I don't know how I did that.

2781
06:54:34,810 --> 06:54:35,209
Here we go.

2782
06:54:35,209 --> 06:54:35,450
Let's go.

2783
06:54:37,689 --> 06:54:38,090
Okay.

2784
06:54:38,090 --> 06:54:38,330
Yep.

2785
06:54:38,330 --> 06:54:39,610
That's exactly what was happening to me.

2786
06:54:40,009 --> 06:54:51,869
I hate this area.

2787
06:54:53,549 --> 06:54:55,869
It's just, it's too, it's like so claustrophobic up here.

2788
06:55:19,209 --> 06:55:27,849
I'm going to do 15 oftentimes.

2789
06:55:40,000 --> 06:55:41,759
Why does Cookie Monster sometimes talk?

2790
06:55:43,040 --> 06:55:45,020
I haven't figured that out yet.

2791
06:55:50,330 --> 06:55:51,369
Watching this makes me sick.

2792
06:55:52,009 --> 06:55:54,569
Playing it also does as well.

2793
06:55:55,639 --> 06:56:07,369
I feel your pain.

2794
06:56:10,729 --> 06:56:12,090
You didn't read chat's joke.

2795
06:56:12,090 --> 06:56:13,770
You made your own minus two joke.

2796
06:56:17,770 --> 06:56:18,810
What are you talking about?

2797
06:56:21,709 --> 06:56:23,229
I asked a question.

2798
06:56:27,599 --> 06:56:29,919
Where is that Cookie Monster voice coming from?

2799
06:56:30,799 --> 06:56:32,080
Remember, that wasn't a very good joke.

2800
06:56:34,279 --> 06:56:36,200
It was a question, sir.

2801
06:56:50,110 --> 06:56:52,509
One of these days, Jerome is going to snap.

2802
06:56:54,400 --> 06:56:55,040
Why?

2803
06:56:55,040 --> 06:56:55,840
What do you think that?

2804
06:56:59,400 --> 06:57:01,240
Is there any particular reason why you think that?

2805
06:57:03,549 --> 06:57:04,270
Do explain.

2806
06:57:04,270 --> 06:57:06,349
I'd like to know what your hypothesis.

2807
06:57:16,520 --> 06:57:17,159
One more.

2808
06:57:17,159 --> 06:57:20,250
No, no, no, no.

2809
06:57:20,250 --> 06:57:20,750
Why?

2810
06:57:41,209 --> 06:57:42,330
You cannot refuse.

2811
06:57:43,610 --> 06:57:44,990
You're not going to complete this one?

2812
06:57:45,790 --> 06:57:49,659
I have to.

2813
06:57:50,220 --> 06:57:54,639
Perhaps you find cures for me.

2814
06:57:54,639 --> 06:57:58,240
And then I talk to the organization about getting you back home.

2815
06:58:02,700 --> 06:58:14,479
Aspirin, water, vitamin A, vitamin D, dog poop.

2816
06:58:14,479 --> 06:58:14,959
What was it?

2817
06:58:15,840 --> 06:58:20,270
Where is it?

2818
06:58:20,909 --> 06:58:24,799
People pink stuff.

2819
06:58:25,599 --> 06:58:33,759
Let's see, up there.

2820
06:58:35,279 --> 06:58:36,639
No, stop.

2821
06:58:36,639 --> 06:58:36,959
Grab it.

2822
06:58:55,639 --> 06:58:56,200
Get off the bike.

2823
06:58:57,159 --> 06:58:57,799
Skate or whatever.

2824
06:59:02,650 --> 06:59:08,590
Actually, just climb up is probably easier.

2825
06:59:15,790 --> 06:59:16,750
Feeling stronger.

2826
06:59:25,150 --> 06:59:25,790
Whoa.

2827
06:59:25,790 --> 06:59:28,110
I just got sucked into a black hole there.

2828
06:59:28,110 --> 06:59:28,430
Hold on.

2829
06:59:41,919 --> 06:59:42,880
I got to get up.

2830
06:59:42,880 --> 06:59:46,599
Can I jump up here?

2831
06:59:48,360 --> 06:59:48,919
I don't think so.

2832
06:59:50,169 --> 06:59:50,889
I got it.

2833
06:59:50,889 --> 06:59:52,169
I just looked into the wall and got it.

2834
06:59:56,880 --> 06:59:57,360
Here, too.

2835
07:00:06,110 --> 07:00:07,470
Aida Caratine.

2836
07:00:07,470 --> 07:00:07,950
Turn around.

2837
07:00:09,759 --> 07:00:10,319
Get out of here.

2838
07:00:13,549 --> 07:00:14,669
I can't grab that one.

2839
07:00:15,229 --> 07:00:21,599
Where's there a line that I can get up here from?

2840
07:00:21,599 --> 07:00:22,000
This way?

2841
07:00:24,639 --> 07:00:25,520
Oh, shit.

2842
07:00:25,520 --> 07:00:25,840
Hold on.

2843
07:00:26,639 --> 07:00:27,439
Do I have to get up there?

2844
07:00:29,770 --> 07:00:30,169
Not good.

2845
07:00:47,770 --> 07:00:48,810
Get up there.

2846
07:00:48,810 --> 07:01:01,770
Is there another way to get up here besides having to jump up here?

2847
07:01:02,650 --> 07:01:11,020
Here?

2848
07:01:11,580 --> 07:01:11,900
Hold on.

2849
07:01:11,900 --> 07:01:12,299
Let's see.

2850
07:01:13,340 --> 07:01:22,919
No.

2851
07:01:23,720 --> 07:01:24,860
I have to.

2852
07:01:24,860 --> 07:01:25,819
I have to just jump across it.

2853
07:01:36,439 --> 07:01:37,930
Shit.

2854
07:01:37,930 --> 07:01:38,169
No.

2855
07:01:39,450 --> 07:01:40,090
No.

2856
07:01:40,090 --> 07:01:40,970
I'm so close.

2857
07:01:40,970 --> 07:01:42,009
Get off the bike.

2858
07:01:42,009 --> 07:01:43,290
I keep going on the bike.

2859
07:01:44,009 --> 07:01:45,849
It's seven hours of screaming that goes through your brain.

2860
07:01:46,569 --> 07:01:59,389
I'm going to have to do it again.

2861
07:02:05,950 --> 07:02:08,110
I'm going to have to do it again.

2862
07:02:08,110 --> 07:02:08,909
Stay up here.

2863
07:02:08,909 --> 07:02:09,229
No.

2864
07:02:10,189 --> 07:02:14,909
I'm trying to just jump over it.

2865
07:02:17,869 --> 07:02:20,000
Let's do it again.

2866
07:02:31,759 --> 07:02:36,080
I had it, too.

2867
07:02:38,159 --> 07:02:39,200
Cleaner this time.

2868
07:02:39,200 --> 07:02:40,080
You don't even have to touch them.

2869
07:02:42,799 --> 07:03:04,720
I got to get some water.

2870
07:03:05,840 --> 07:03:06,720
I got to drink some water.

2871
07:03:07,759 --> 07:03:08,560
It's blending together.

2872
07:03:10,159 --> 07:03:11,360
The world's blending together.

2873
07:03:11,360 --> 07:03:12,159
I got to get some water.

2874
07:03:12,799 --> 07:03:15,900
I got to get some water.

2875
07:03:15,900 --> 07:03:17,580
All tricks are becoming the same trick.

2876
07:03:18,380 --> 07:03:19,900
And all lines are the same line.

2877
07:03:21,720 --> 07:03:36,139
It's water time.

2878
07:03:36,139 --> 07:03:37,580
Remember the guy that wrote it all caps?

2879
07:03:37,580 --> 07:03:39,259
You're never going to beat this mission.

2880
07:03:42,959 --> 07:03:43,279
Okay.

2881
07:03:43,279 --> 07:03:56,439
All right, let's go.

2882
07:04:12,590 --> 07:04:13,069
Wink.

2883
07:04:13,069 --> 07:04:29,240
I'm in the middle of a really, really hard mission.

2884
07:04:30,279 --> 07:04:31,400
Just hold on a second.

2885
07:04:32,119 --> 07:04:40,909
Oh, my God.

2886
07:04:40,909 --> 07:04:42,590
Stop getting stuck on every polygon.

2887
07:04:43,310 --> 07:04:48,250
There it is.

2888
07:04:49,130 --> 07:04:53,880
No, I was on it.

2889
07:04:53,880 --> 07:04:54,840
Why did I have to jump?

2890
07:04:56,479 --> 07:04:56,799
Fuck.

2891
07:04:57,360 --> 07:04:58,959
No, no.

2892
07:05:06,490 --> 07:05:08,169
I got to go up around that again.

2893
07:05:08,169 --> 07:05:08,970
It's the only way to do it.

2894
07:05:21,759 --> 07:05:23,119
I don't like this area.

2895
07:05:26,639 --> 07:05:29,599
This is my least favorite level in the game so far.

2896
07:05:29,599 --> 07:05:57,040
I have to get on this and then I make it from I have to just jump to jump the tower.

2897
07:06:01,200 --> 07:06:02,799
I have to just jump over this tower.

2898
07:06:02,799 --> 07:06:11,119
I can get over here.

2899
07:06:20,669 --> 07:06:31,479
The ladder over there is seriously.

2900
07:06:39,159 --> 07:06:39,479
Okay.

2901
07:06:39,479 --> 07:06:40,279
Get me the fuck over here.

2902
07:06:40,279 --> 07:06:41,080
Get off the get off.

2903
07:06:41,080 --> 07:06:41,720
Get off.

2904
07:06:41,720 --> 07:06:45,479
Where is it?

2905
07:06:52,200 --> 07:06:52,759
Oh, my God.

2906
07:06:52,759 --> 07:06:56,439
I'm going to scream into this microphone and fucking blow out my vocal cords.

2907
07:07:02,360 --> 07:07:14,520
That was horrible.

2908
07:07:26,200 --> 07:07:27,479
Don't look inside.

2909
07:07:30,569 --> 07:07:33,369
Don't let any of the guards see you with it either.

2910
07:07:33,369 --> 07:07:36,169
They are on the walls and there are many more in this.

2911
07:07:36,169 --> 07:07:37,930
Wait, now that I can focus.

2912
07:07:40,409 --> 07:07:41,849
And you made it into the cave.

2913
07:07:42,810 --> 07:07:46,250
The cave of the greasy fucking mad streamer.

2914
07:07:49,880 --> 07:07:51,959
What questions do you have for me?

2915
07:07:51,959 --> 07:07:59,919
Alexander is near St. Basil's.

2916
07:07:59,919 --> 07:08:02,159
It is the pointy thing you don't remember.

2917
07:08:10,759 --> 07:08:11,000
Bye.

2918
07:08:11,000 --> 07:08:14,680
Bye.

2919
07:08:14,680 --> 07:08:15,880
Get me out of Moscow.

2920
07:08:17,439 --> 07:08:18,959
I don't like that wall.

2921
07:08:18,959 --> 07:08:19,840
I don't like that wall.

2922
07:08:19,840 --> 07:08:25,119
Oh, there's the ladder that everyone was talking about.

2923
07:08:42,250 --> 07:08:43,770
Oh, you can't like punch.

2924
07:08:43,770 --> 07:08:46,569
I can't like jump on them and knock them down.

2925
07:08:47,849 --> 07:08:48,090
What?

2926
07:08:48,090 --> 07:08:49,290
I can't knock them down.

2927
07:08:49,290 --> 07:08:51,209
I can't like run into them with my skateboard.

2928
07:08:53,930 --> 07:08:55,689
I've just done a stealth mission.

2929
07:08:55,689 --> 07:08:56,490
Oh, great.

2930
07:09:01,740 --> 07:09:02,700
Go around that guard.

2931
07:09:03,580 --> 07:09:20,439
Wink, redeem.

2932
07:09:20,439 --> 07:09:20,759
Hold on.

2933
07:09:20,759 --> 07:09:21,799
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2934
07:09:21,799 --> 07:09:22,759
I can't stop.

2935
07:09:22,759 --> 07:09:23,720
Don't you understand?

2936
07:09:23,720 --> 07:09:24,599
I can't.

2937
07:09:24,599 --> 07:09:27,479
I'm going to be in big trouble if I fuck this up.

2938
07:09:28,040 --> 07:09:30,619
Is there a guard down there?

2939
07:09:31,340 --> 07:09:32,990
Can I skate this?

2940
07:09:36,909 --> 07:09:37,229
Fuck.

2941
07:09:37,229 --> 07:10:01,209
You are going home, but you are welcome back here anytime.

2942
07:10:01,209 --> 07:10:04,430
I did it.

2943
07:10:04,430 --> 07:10:16,479
You look horrifying.

2944
07:10:16,479 --> 07:10:18,970
Come on.

2945
07:10:18,970 --> 07:10:19,450
Come on.

2946
07:10:19,450 --> 07:10:19,930
Give me a...

2947
07:10:20,729 --> 07:10:21,610
Come on, man.

2948
07:10:22,330 --> 07:10:27,659
As I walked into your room one day when you were sitting there playing a game

2949
07:10:27,659 --> 07:10:29,180
and I just like knocked on the door.

2950
07:10:30,139 --> 07:10:33,340
And you're in the dark and you turn and I just go, you look fucking horrible.

2951
07:10:34,779 --> 07:10:36,639
I gotta close the door.

2952
07:10:36,639 --> 07:10:38,400
I don't care how many kids are waiting.

2953
07:10:39,200 --> 07:10:44,009
Who's here?

2954
07:10:44,009 --> 07:10:46,009
I was hoping to see you.

2955
07:10:46,009 --> 07:10:49,689
I never got to thank you for handing me best new pro back in Russia.

2956
07:10:49,689 --> 07:10:51,209
You still don't get it.

2957
07:10:51,209 --> 07:10:52,090
No, homie.

2958
07:10:52,090 --> 07:10:53,209
I got it all.

2959
07:10:53,209 --> 07:10:56,650
My own company, six cars in my garage, a record deal in the worst company.

2960
07:10:56,650 --> 07:10:57,770
Russia to New Jersey.

2961
07:10:57,770 --> 07:10:58,729
How long is that flight?

2962
07:10:59,369 --> 07:11:00,090
You go ahead.

2963
07:11:00,090 --> 07:11:03,290
Keep telling yourself you're happy, but it ain't about the money.

2964
07:11:03,369 --> 07:11:05,930
I can't believe I'm wasting my time with this jackass.

2965
07:11:05,930 --> 07:11:08,490
He probably skates for minimum wage.

2966
07:11:08,490 --> 07:11:08,970
See ya.

2967
07:11:11,819 --> 07:11:12,459
You'll see.

2968
07:11:12,459 --> 07:11:13,659
I'm not going anywhere.

2969
07:11:13,659 --> 07:11:15,580
I still got a few real friends left.

2970
07:11:17,180 --> 07:11:17,979
Like Tony Hawk.

2971
07:11:19,020 --> 07:11:20,619
He gives me a stomach ache.

2972
07:11:20,619 --> 07:11:24,060
I can't believe kids will look at Eric and think that's what skating is about.

2973
07:11:24,779 --> 07:11:27,180
Look, you got a deal if you want to make it as a pro.

2974
07:11:27,900 --> 07:11:30,380
Man, I just want to skate like the old days.

2975
07:11:30,380 --> 07:11:32,939
It used to relax me, not stress me out.

2976
07:11:33,580 --> 07:11:34,939
That's your deal, man.

2977
07:11:35,500 --> 07:11:37,500
Skating is whatever you make it.

2978
07:11:37,500 --> 07:11:38,939
It didn't change.

2979
07:11:38,939 --> 07:11:40,619
You're the one that changed.

2980
07:11:40,619 --> 07:11:41,979
Now go skate.

2981
07:11:41,979 --> 07:11:44,060
You'll remember why you started in the first place.

2982
07:11:45,020 --> 07:11:47,340
Oh no, he hates, he hates skating now.

2983
07:11:49,400 --> 07:11:50,680
He hates skating.

2984
07:11:53,020 --> 07:11:54,299
He used to love skating.

2985
07:11:54,299 --> 07:11:56,060
Hey, good to see you again.

2986
07:11:56,779 --> 07:11:59,099
How's that whole life been working out for you?

2987
07:12:01,209 --> 07:12:03,369
Hey, Sean, going okay.

2988
07:12:03,369 --> 07:12:04,970
About to get a lot better.

2989
07:12:04,970 --> 07:12:06,569
I'm going to make a comeback.

2990
07:12:06,650 --> 07:12:08,330
Check out this new trick I invented.

2991
07:12:10,490 --> 07:12:12,490
Damn, you are shooting for a comeback.

2992
07:12:12,490 --> 07:12:13,369
Do I get to show him?

2993
07:12:15,630 --> 07:12:16,270
Let's see it.

2994
07:12:32,700 --> 07:12:34,540
That's the cannon one that I invented.

2995
07:12:37,389 --> 07:12:38,750
Oh, that's so stupid.

2996
07:12:40,110 --> 07:12:50,029
That's so much worse than mine.

2997
07:12:50,029 --> 07:12:51,310
Mine's way better.

2998
07:12:51,310 --> 07:13:04,159
Create a trick, welcome.

2999
07:13:04,159 --> 07:13:05,200
You can create, yes, I know.

3000
07:13:06,400 --> 07:13:07,360
Modify my trick.

3001
07:13:34,349 --> 07:13:40,880
Funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

3002
07:13:42,560 --> 07:13:43,439
But it shouldn't be.

3003
07:13:53,049 --> 07:13:55,130
That's like shouldn't be the funniest thing ever.

3004
07:13:56,189 --> 07:14:00,669
Okay, so we're back in New Jersey, ready to go.

3005
07:14:01,310 --> 07:14:10,650
And the first thing, what do we have to do here?

3006
07:14:12,409 --> 07:14:14,169
Combo the entire city.

3007
07:14:16,729 --> 07:14:19,529
Hell yeah, I remember you doing sweet lines way back when.

3008
07:14:20,090 --> 07:14:21,450
Got a new one, eh?

3009
07:14:21,450 --> 07:14:23,770
All right, I'll put it on film, you hit it.

3010
07:14:24,569 --> 07:14:37,369
Combo the whole city.

3011
07:14:37,930 --> 07:14:57,340
Oh man, this is going to be tricky.

3012
07:14:58,459 --> 07:15:05,069
I'm going to jump off.

3013
07:15:09,020 --> 07:15:10,779
I hate this because I was bad at this.

3014
07:15:14,799 --> 07:15:16,000
This is hard, this game's not easy.

3015
07:15:23,450 --> 07:15:24,169
Seven out of ten.

3016
07:15:35,790 --> 07:15:37,709
I want to get some water too, I forgot to do that.

3017
07:15:37,709 --> 07:15:38,270
I really need it.

3018
07:15:39,709 --> 07:15:43,389
Yeah, I'm starting to get a little hydration deprived.

3019
07:15:45,069 --> 07:15:46,189
I'll be right back.

3020
07:15:46,189 --> 07:15:46,750
Get some water.

3021
07:20:40,779 --> 07:20:45,310
Okay, fully hydrated.

3022
07:20:46,110 --> 07:20:52,729
I drank a full glass.

3023
07:20:52,729 --> 07:20:59,049
I'm ready to go.

3024
07:20:59,930 --> 07:21:00,810
Ready?

3025
07:21:00,810 --> 07:21:02,009
Oh, this is the power of hydration.

3026
07:21:03,450 --> 07:21:07,360
It hasn't gotten in my bloodstream yet.

3027
07:21:07,360 --> 07:21:08,000
Hold on.

3028
07:21:08,000 --> 07:21:18,720
My manual's dropping so hard.

3029
07:21:19,599 --> 07:21:21,130
My manual's just dumping.

3030
07:21:21,130 --> 07:21:22,409
I don't even need to start there.

3031
07:21:22,409 --> 07:21:23,849
That's a shitty line to start on.

3032
07:21:24,810 --> 07:21:25,930
Sorry, wait.

3033
07:21:26,970 --> 07:21:29,259
Oh, only five seconds, that's...

3034
07:21:29,259 --> 07:21:30,459
Oh god, okay.

3035
07:21:31,020 --> 07:21:53,919
That's kind of like a trap, I feel like that's a trap.

3036
07:21:55,040 --> 07:22:07,580
Oh, there we go.

3037
07:22:07,580 --> 07:22:08,080
There it is.

3038
07:22:08,459 --> 07:22:08,959
No!

3039
07:22:11,340 --> 07:22:14,110
All right, you just have to hold, you stay on it.

3040
07:22:14,990 --> 07:22:16,349
This stupid fucking flip.

3041
07:22:20,169 --> 07:22:22,330
Oh, that manual is going to be hard to hold.

3042
07:22:23,290 --> 07:22:27,930
That was almost really cool, almost.

3043
07:22:35,419 --> 07:22:53,529
Oops, ah, I didn't hit it.

3044
07:22:54,330 --> 07:22:58,669
Get off the board.

3045
07:22:58,669 --> 07:22:59,950
Yeah, that's true, I can do that.

3046
07:23:00,909 --> 07:23:02,939
Let's see if I can get it in one go though.

3047
07:23:03,659 --> 07:23:06,349
I'm currently addicted.

3048
07:23:24,000 --> 07:23:24,880
Why are you not facing me?

3049
07:23:24,880 --> 07:23:25,380
Look at me.

3050
07:23:26,080 --> 07:23:33,319
He didn't even want to look at me.

3051
07:23:33,959 --> 07:23:36,060
I just did the sickest combo ever.

3052
07:23:37,979 --> 07:23:38,860
Five community subs from...

3053
07:23:40,380 --> 07:23:40,880
Six.

3054
07:23:41,659 --> 07:23:42,380
Thanks, Pelsix.

3055
07:23:56,650 --> 07:23:59,529
Perfect, then all we need to do is find a great name for our team.

3056
07:24:00,650 --> 07:24:01,930
Name the team, okay.

3057
07:24:02,970 --> 07:24:07,770
Before any of these other guys are going to want to know that I'm still for real.

3058
07:24:09,049 --> 07:24:12,409
I'm guessing with everything that's been going on, most people have forgotten.

3059
07:24:13,450 --> 07:24:16,009
Well, I guess I'll just have to remind everyone.

3060
07:24:16,970 --> 07:24:33,520
Let's go.

3061
07:24:44,669 --> 07:24:45,470
That reminds her...

3062
07:24:45,470 --> 07:24:45,970
What?

3063
07:24:46,590 --> 07:24:47,459
Fell off?

3064
07:24:48,970 --> 07:24:50,490
I just wanted to turn around.

3065
07:24:51,450 --> 07:24:54,240
Flush.

3066
07:24:55,259 --> 07:25:03,419
This guy's made out of...

3067
07:25:04,139 --> 07:25:06,139
This guy's made out of rubber bands.

3068
07:25:06,139 --> 07:25:07,500
For the love of God.

3069
07:25:07,500 --> 07:25:10,380
He says I keep kicking the shit out of this guy.

3070
07:25:11,580 --> 07:25:12,619
I feel so bad.

3071
07:25:17,580 --> 07:25:18,220
All right, let's do it.

3072
07:25:28,490 --> 07:25:29,689
Nail all the tricks.

3073
07:25:30,650 --> 07:25:32,250
Come on, somebody's air-conditioning.

3074
07:25:49,740 --> 07:25:50,220
Wait, what?

3075
07:25:50,220 --> 07:25:51,259
Stop, stop, stop!

3076
07:25:51,259 --> 07:25:52,000
Do it again.

3077
07:26:03,310 --> 07:26:06,349
Is this not low house lift?

3078
07:26:06,349 --> 07:26:07,069
Oh, I got it, I got it.

3079
07:26:11,049 --> 07:26:14,540
Tony Hawk's got a game.

3080
07:26:14,540 --> 07:26:15,819
Yep, he's got a few of them.

3081
07:26:16,380 --> 07:26:21,020
Tony Hawk 1, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2,

3082
07:26:21,020 --> 07:26:23,659
Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Tony Hawk for the Weave,

3083
07:26:23,659 --> 07:26:25,419
Tony Hawk for the Weave with a skateboard...

3084
07:26:25,419 --> 07:26:26,619
Ruff-Roll, what else does he have?

3085
07:26:29,049 --> 07:26:31,529
Tony Hawk Project 8, right?

3086
07:26:34,560 --> 07:26:35,520
Tony Hawk 4, right.

3087
07:26:36,159 --> 07:26:45,419
All right, um, Burial Invert to Fakie.

3088
07:26:45,419 --> 07:26:50,330
Oh, how am I doing this wrong?

3089
07:26:55,389 --> 07:26:57,389
How am I doing this wrong?

3090
07:26:57,389 --> 07:26:59,630
That's just a lift trick, isn't it?

3091
07:27:18,569 --> 07:27:19,689
Let's switch rooms.

3092
07:27:22,250 --> 07:27:25,689
All right, lift tricks always are just kind of...

3093
07:27:27,290 --> 07:27:29,450
You know, I've played every Tony Hawk game.

3094
07:27:29,450 --> 07:27:34,729
I still don't really understand how a lift trick actually even works to not grind.

3095
07:27:37,049 --> 07:27:38,650
Like, you know what I'm saying?

3096
07:27:39,610 --> 07:27:43,689
Because I'm only, I'm doing up and wide, but there's other tricks that I can do.

3097
07:27:43,849 --> 07:27:47,770
I thought these specials, they might be.

3098
07:28:08,250 --> 07:28:10,409
See, I always have trouble with these plants.

3099
07:28:12,490 --> 07:28:14,569
I just try to do left and wide at the same time.

3100
07:28:21,290 --> 07:28:31,979
Here we go, more of this Invert, that's a gymnast plant.

3101
07:28:33,580 --> 07:28:43,680
Invert, Invert, Invert.

3102
07:28:43,680 --> 07:28:51,040
Isn't that what I'm doing?

3103
07:28:51,040 --> 07:28:51,759
Switch a room.

3104
07:28:52,400 --> 07:28:52,959
There it is.

3105
07:28:54,729 --> 07:28:56,639
One foot, okay.

3106
07:29:00,669 --> 07:29:02,830
Burial, I can't get this one though.

3107
07:29:03,470 --> 07:29:09,240
Nose butt, whatever, nose, whatever.

3108
07:29:10,040 --> 07:29:11,040
There it is.

3109
07:29:11,040 --> 07:29:12,799
All right, it's because of the analog.

3110
07:29:14,720 --> 07:29:15,200
One second.

3111
07:29:16,720 --> 07:29:19,759
It's because I wasn't, the D-pad sucks with it.

3112
07:29:19,759 --> 07:29:22,240
So if I need to do a plant trick, I'll just use the analog.

3113
07:29:23,200 --> 07:29:38,029
All right, we got one more thing to do here and then what's next?

3114
07:29:41,919 --> 07:29:44,560
Score a big, all right, a million points.

3115
07:29:51,119 --> 07:29:52,959
Big points, 200,000 points, let's go.

3116
07:30:01,389 --> 07:30:01,889
What?

3117
07:30:03,689 --> 07:30:04,430
Did I lose it?

3118
07:30:06,430 --> 07:30:16,000
Restart Randy, I know.

3119
07:30:17,439 --> 07:30:19,680
I'm like this with every one of these games though.

3120
07:30:19,680 --> 07:30:20,720
There's nothing I can do about it.

3121
07:30:21,520 --> 07:30:25,209
I feel like my balance has gotten worse.

3122
07:30:26,090 --> 07:30:29,200
Is that like even possible?

3123
07:30:29,200 --> 07:30:29,700
No way.

3124
07:30:30,560 --> 07:30:38,169
That just fucked me up.

3125
07:30:38,970 --> 07:30:41,630
I have to restart.

3126
07:30:41,630 --> 07:30:42,349
That was so bad.

3127
07:30:47,400 --> 07:30:48,360
That move, man.

3128
07:30:48,360 --> 07:30:49,720
I got to get that out of here.

3129
07:30:49,720 --> 07:30:50,919
I got to delete that move.

3130
07:30:51,560 --> 07:31:09,840
All right, 80,000, look at that.

3131
07:31:09,840 --> 07:31:12,000
Huge gift subs, just a second.

3132
07:31:26,520 --> 07:31:27,799
Yeah, I was trying to grab onto that.

3133
07:31:28,439 --> 07:31:34,939
Ow.

3134
07:31:35,959 --> 07:31:53,580
There we go.

3135
07:31:53,580 --> 07:31:55,020
That's exactly what I want to do.

3136
07:31:55,020 --> 07:31:57,240
It's an old secret technique.

3137
07:31:57,240 --> 07:32:02,880
That was a lot.

3138
07:32:02,880 --> 07:32:10,720
Hey, where it is you've really been tearing it up.

3139
07:32:11,279 --> 07:32:12,799
Here you're starting a new team as well.

3140
07:32:13,520 --> 07:32:16,479
This bear is getting really good at video games.

3141
07:32:17,200 --> 07:32:17,599
You know what?

3142
07:32:17,599 --> 07:32:21,200
That's the fucking like that's the comment that I like to see the most.

3143
07:32:21,919 --> 07:32:23,740
The answer is no, though.

3144
07:32:27,959 --> 07:32:29,560
They say you want to cut through all the bullshit.

3145
07:32:30,119 --> 07:32:32,360
Just hook up some guys that want to see how far they can take skating.

3146
07:32:33,639 --> 07:32:36,759
Imagine getting mad at a fart joke.

3147
07:32:37,479 --> 07:32:38,439
Would somebody mad here?

3148
07:32:39,560 --> 07:32:42,540
Wait, is somebody actually upset here?

3149
07:32:44,430 --> 07:32:46,909
Did somebody come in and say like, fuck, that's not fucking funny?

3150
07:32:47,709 --> 07:32:48,830
Shit.

3151
07:32:49,229 --> 07:32:49,709
Yes.

3152
07:32:49,709 --> 07:32:50,349
Oh, no.

3153
07:32:54,349 --> 07:32:55,389
You know, all right, whatever.

3154
07:32:55,389 --> 07:32:56,909
That means I'll do it three more times in a row.

3155
07:32:56,909 --> 07:32:58,110
I think that sounds pretty cool.

3156
07:32:59,069 --> 07:33:02,830
Pick your team members.

3157
07:33:02,830 --> 07:33:03,950
Bam Margera, of course.

3158
07:33:04,750 --> 07:33:07,680
Tony Hawk.

3159
07:33:09,919 --> 07:33:10,639
And who?

3160
07:33:11,439 --> 07:33:13,180
Tony Hawk, Bam Margera.

3161
07:33:14,240 --> 07:33:17,939
And this is Pup.

3162
07:33:19,139 --> 07:33:19,779
Chad Muska.

3163
07:33:20,580 --> 07:33:25,459
Hey, Chad Muska was there when we first started.

3164
07:33:26,340 --> 07:33:31,139
Chad Muska found us and discovered us and gave us our first gig.

3165
07:33:31,860 --> 07:33:36,060
Chad Muska can do more.

3166
07:33:36,779 --> 07:33:38,479
It's Rodney.

3167
07:33:39,790 --> 07:33:41,630
Rodney, Rodney, Rodney, Rodney Mullen.

3168
07:33:42,900 --> 07:33:55,250
And Eric.

3169
07:33:58,299 --> 07:34:03,779
Wait, is that the evil Eric or is Mike V?

3170
07:34:06,340 --> 07:34:07,939
That's not evil Eric, right?

3171
07:34:07,939 --> 07:34:08,979
All right, yeah, Eric.

3172
07:34:08,979 --> 07:34:09,479
Eric Tom.

3173
07:34:10,099 --> 07:34:14,319
So the name of the team is going to be the Destructors.

3174
07:34:19,889 --> 07:34:21,810
How about Questers?

3175
07:34:22,450 --> 07:34:23,630
Crunchers.

3176
07:34:24,590 --> 07:34:25,790
The Flush Force.

3177
07:34:26,349 --> 07:34:26,990
Flush Force.

3178
07:34:27,549 --> 07:34:28,750
Sounds good to me.

3179
07:34:29,549 --> 07:34:49,139
Flush Force.

3180
07:34:49,860 --> 07:34:53,139
Flush Force Assemble.

3181
07:34:55,060 --> 07:34:56,099
You know what would be awesome?

3182
07:34:56,099 --> 07:34:58,659
If I could give them different moves.

3183
07:34:58,659 --> 07:35:00,259
Just give them all for every move.

3184
07:35:00,259 --> 07:35:00,500
I thought.

3185
07:35:00,500 --> 07:35:01,220
Okay, we gotta kill a team.

3186
07:35:01,220 --> 07:35:02,819
Now to spread the word.

3187
07:35:02,819 --> 07:35:04,419
We're gonna make an escape video.

3188
07:35:04,419 --> 07:35:06,340
But we're not gonna make some cookie cutter film

3189
07:35:06,340 --> 07:35:08,659
where everybody is skating the same stuff.

3190
07:35:08,659 --> 07:35:10,819
We're gonna make something bigger and better.

3191
07:35:10,819 --> 07:35:12,500
Totally unexpected.

3192
07:35:12,500 --> 07:35:13,619
Check this, dude.

3193
07:35:13,619 --> 07:35:14,979
I've had this for years.

3194
07:35:15,860 --> 07:35:17,700
I've been saving this list of secret spots

3195
07:35:17,700 --> 07:35:18,740
since Animal Chin.

3196
07:35:20,500 --> 07:35:22,419
You know, it's actually...

3197
07:35:22,979 --> 07:35:25,380
I'm supposed to do shit like that.

3198
07:35:25,380 --> 07:35:26,740
Big Apple Spot Challenge.

3199
07:35:26,740 --> 07:35:27,220
Here it is.

3200
07:35:27,220 --> 07:35:28,259
You still have your steak and cheese?

3201
07:35:38,369 --> 07:35:39,009
Get ready to...

3202
07:35:39,970 --> 07:35:40,529
Get ready to...

3203
07:35:41,250 --> 07:35:42,209
Here we go.

3204
07:35:42,209 --> 07:35:43,490
I have four attempts to do this.

3205
07:35:44,130 --> 07:35:45,009
It was a cheese steak.

3206
07:35:45,009 --> 07:35:46,049
I just said steak and cheese.

3207
07:35:46,049 --> 07:35:46,450
Next part.

3208
07:35:46,450 --> 07:35:48,209
I want to shoot just one long take.

3209
07:35:48,209 --> 07:35:49,650
You know, get some smooth...

3210
07:35:49,650 --> 07:35:49,970
What?

3211
07:35:49,970 --> 07:35:51,330
Street skating to New York.

3212
07:35:53,099 --> 07:35:53,979
You just reversed it.

3213
07:35:55,490 --> 07:35:56,450
Bacon Cheese Challenge.

3214
07:35:56,450 --> 07:35:57,009
Here it comes.

3215
07:35:59,580 --> 07:36:01,340
Every object before my film runs out.

3216
07:36:02,459 --> 07:36:04,259
Select a teammate.

3217
07:36:04,979 --> 07:36:06,529
Oh, Jarrah.

3218
07:36:07,490 --> 07:36:32,299
It's not even my character.

3219
07:36:32,299 --> 07:36:32,540
What?

3220
07:36:32,540 --> 07:36:33,580
This is not even my character.

3221
07:36:34,299 --> 07:36:34,380
Why?

3222
07:36:34,380 --> 07:36:35,099
Why can't it be me?

3223
07:36:36,139 --> 07:36:40,500
I don't...

3224
07:36:40,500 --> 07:36:40,900
I don't...

3225
07:36:40,900 --> 07:36:41,459
This is...

3226
07:36:41,459 --> 07:36:42,419
He handles differently.

3227
07:36:43,860 --> 07:36:45,700
You can't make me toad the whole game

3228
07:36:45,700 --> 07:36:47,459
and then make me play as Donkey Kong

3229
07:36:47,459 --> 07:36:48,659
when I've never done that before.

3230
07:37:45,150 --> 07:37:45,869
He doesn't have the flush.

3231
07:37:46,590 --> 07:37:47,310
He doesn't have it.

3232
07:37:48,029 --> 07:38:05,950
I can do this.

3233
07:38:05,950 --> 07:38:06,669
I have four attempts.

3234
07:38:07,389 --> 07:38:09,279
You have four attempts to do

3235
07:38:09,279 --> 07:38:10,400
Big Spot Challenge.

3236
07:38:11,360 --> 07:38:11,599
Sure.

3237
07:38:12,240 --> 07:38:12,479
Let's go.

3238
07:38:13,680 --> 07:38:54,430
Oh, I got 13?

3239
07:38:54,430 --> 07:38:55,549
Not even close.

3240
07:38:55,549 --> 07:39:00,099
It's not even close.

3241
07:39:00,099 --> 07:39:01,860
I don't want to be bad much yet.

3242
07:39:21,150 --> 07:39:24,590
Come on.

3243
07:39:25,310 --> 07:39:26,590
24 out of 44.

3244
07:39:31,790 --> 07:39:32,110
Five.

3245
07:39:34,750 --> 07:39:38,590
How many more times?

3246
07:39:45,470 --> 07:39:47,069
You got to try to get it all in one line.

3247
07:39:48,430 --> 07:39:50,029
Or at least a lot of it in one line.

3248
07:39:51,150 --> 07:39:52,270
27 out of 44.

3249
07:39:52,270 --> 07:39:53,150
This is definitely doable.

3250
07:39:54,430 --> 07:39:55,229
In four attempts.

3251
07:39:56,990 --> 07:40:03,069
Definitely not going to be this one.

3252
07:40:03,709 --> 07:40:09,409
Yeah, that's it.

3253
07:40:09,409 --> 07:40:09,650
All right.

3254
07:40:09,650 --> 07:40:10,529
This is attempt number three.

3255
07:40:12,349 --> 07:40:13,150
Oh, no.

3256
07:40:13,150 --> 07:40:13,549
Fuck.

3257
07:40:13,549 --> 07:40:17,790
Oh, I just like literally dropped the ball.

3258
07:40:18,750 --> 07:40:22,849
All right.

3259
07:40:31,840 --> 07:40:32,560
All right.

3260
07:40:32,560 --> 07:40:47,810
Okay.

3261
07:40:55,220 --> 07:41:21,580
Go this way.

3262
07:41:22,299 --> 07:41:22,779
How many more?

3263
07:41:24,060 --> 07:41:46,529
27.

3264
07:41:51,650 --> 07:42:02,060
You got to do it all in one go?

3265
07:42:03,180 --> 07:42:03,900
Yeah, I know.

3266
07:42:04,860 --> 07:42:07,709
This is that's hard.

3267
07:42:07,709 --> 07:42:08,029
All right.

3268
07:42:08,029 --> 07:42:08,590
Try it again.

3269
07:42:12,610 --> 07:42:13,250
You don't have to.

3270
07:42:13,250 --> 07:42:13,650
I don't care.

3271
07:42:14,290 --> 07:42:15,819
You don't have to throw up your steak and cheese.

3272
07:42:30,340 --> 07:42:32,340
You get to keep it inside your stomach where it belongs.

3273
07:42:41,869 --> 07:42:42,110
No.

3274
07:42:42,110 --> 07:42:42,430
Okay.

3275
07:42:42,430 --> 07:42:44,029
I got to go up that ramp.

3276
07:42:44,029 --> 07:42:44,270
All right.

3277
07:42:44,270 --> 07:42:44,590
Let's go.

3278
07:42:47,180 --> 07:42:50,779
Take this.

3279
07:42:53,060 --> 07:42:54,819
I mean, yeah, but I didn't really do it.

3280
07:42:55,540 --> 07:43:05,180
Are they all like this?

3281
07:43:05,180 --> 07:43:06,860
Or is this one in particular just the one that's?

3282
07:43:08,580 --> 07:43:09,220
Is this this?

3283
07:43:09,860 --> 07:43:10,819
Are they all like this?

3284
07:43:10,819 --> 07:43:11,380
Every single one?

3285
07:43:12,580 --> 07:43:16,020
Or is this the I'm going to throw up the big challenge one?

3286
07:43:17,790 --> 07:43:18,830
This is the one.

3287
07:43:18,830 --> 07:43:19,869
This is the one that's hard.

3288
07:43:20,830 --> 07:43:22,020
Try it again.

3289
07:43:22,819 --> 07:43:23,299
One line.

3290
07:43:24,340 --> 07:43:43,520
Not bad.

3291
07:43:43,520 --> 07:43:44,479
Not a terrible start.

3292
07:43:45,279 --> 07:43:45,840
Could be worse.

3293
07:43:46,479 --> 07:44:03,020
Let's put a score and I touch that to grind it.

3294
07:44:03,659 --> 07:44:17,700
You got to learn it.

3295
07:44:18,259 --> 07:44:20,020
I mean, you got to learn the entire route.

3296
07:44:21,060 --> 07:44:23,659
Doing that in one trick.

3297
07:44:23,659 --> 07:44:25,580
I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.

3298
07:44:25,580 --> 07:44:26,860
I'm not going to be able to do that.

3299
07:44:37,060 --> 07:44:37,700
20.

3300
07:44:37,700 --> 07:44:40,529
A lot of shit over here.

3301
07:44:41,330 --> 07:45:01,459
30 out of 44.

3302
07:45:02,020 --> 07:45:05,439
Is it every single one or you just have to get 44?

3303
07:45:05,439 --> 07:45:07,040
Or is it all of them a 44?

3304
07:45:15,630 --> 07:45:16,830
All of them is 44.

3305
07:45:18,979 --> 07:45:24,110
Well, I don't think I'll be doing this one.

3306
07:45:24,110 --> 07:45:47,279
I'm not getting over there.

3307
07:45:47,279 --> 07:45:51,490
Nope.

3308
07:45:51,490 --> 07:45:52,130
Nope.

3309
07:45:52,130 --> 07:45:53,900
Nope.

3310
07:45:53,900 --> 07:45:56,479
Nope.

3311
07:45:56,479 --> 07:45:57,919
For this next part, I want to shoot this.

3312
07:45:58,959 --> 07:45:59,200
Wait.

3313
07:46:00,240 --> 07:46:00,479
What?

3314
07:46:05,729 --> 07:46:05,970
Wait.

3315
07:46:06,849 --> 07:46:08,430
I can't leave?

3316
07:46:08,430 --> 07:46:09,069
Why can't I?

3317
07:46:09,069 --> 07:46:09,470
There we go.

3318
07:46:09,470 --> 07:46:10,029
Change the level.

3319
07:46:10,029 --> 07:46:13,650
Get me out of here.

3320
07:46:13,650 --> 07:46:17,299
End goal.

3321
07:46:17,299 --> 07:46:17,860
Few goals.

3322
07:46:17,860 --> 07:46:18,099
Okay.

3323
07:46:20,020 --> 07:46:22,020
Jersey spine trick shot.

3324
07:46:22,020 --> 07:46:22,900
Apples.

3325
07:46:22,900 --> 07:46:23,619
Big apples.

3326
07:46:23,619 --> 07:46:24,580
I'm not there with that one.

3327
07:46:25,540 --> 07:46:32,529
How about slam a jamma?

3328
07:46:32,529 --> 07:46:35,040
Let's try slam a jamma.

3329
07:46:38,459 --> 07:46:38,939
Check it.

3330
07:46:38,939 --> 07:46:42,860
Peralta pulled some strings and got us onto the slam city course after hours.

3331
07:46:43,979 --> 07:46:47,099
This setup is perfect for a real street technician.

3332
07:46:47,099 --> 07:46:49,740
We should be able to shoot some nice long combo lines.

3333
07:46:51,419 --> 07:46:54,299
I've only got enough footage for a set number of lines.

3334
07:46:54,299 --> 07:46:56,939
So hit as many markers in one combo as you can.

3335
07:47:12,220 --> 07:47:20,290
I feel like this is going to be a significant portion of the rest of this stream.

3336
07:47:21,810 --> 07:47:34,110
Man, you have to do 10 combos.

3337
07:47:35,360 --> 07:47:36,479
You have nine combos.

3338
07:47:37,200 --> 07:47:37,840
I don't understand.

3339
07:47:38,479 --> 07:47:42,450
You have nine combos?

3340
07:47:44,639 --> 07:47:46,080
I only have to do...

3341
07:47:46,080 --> 07:47:46,560
I get it.

3342
07:47:47,439 --> 07:47:49,779
I have to do this in that...

3343
07:47:53,540 --> 07:47:53,779
No.

3344
07:47:54,990 --> 07:47:57,229
Oh, no.

3345
07:47:57,229 --> 07:47:59,950
Am I not going to be able to beat Tony Hawk's Underground?

3346
07:48:01,659 --> 07:48:04,380
I was hoping we were going to be at the last level after eight hours.

3347
07:48:17,549 --> 07:48:33,310
I'm sorry, Tony.

3348
07:48:52,259 --> 07:48:53,220
Let me see the other ones.

3349
07:48:53,860 --> 07:48:56,080
These are going to be so hard for me to do.

3350
07:48:58,209 --> 07:49:02,290
How about Vancouver spine challenge?

3351
07:49:02,290 --> 07:49:08,419
Those are the two hardest ones.

3352
07:49:09,220 --> 07:49:09,619
Are they?

3353
07:49:19,139 --> 07:49:26,380
Load, land, spine series.

3354
07:49:32,299 --> 07:49:34,939
Okay, land, spine series.

3355
07:49:36,779 --> 07:49:44,049
Okay, let's just spine over this.

3356
07:49:45,919 --> 07:49:46,639
Okay, there's one.

3357
07:49:47,520 --> 07:49:50,619
I would have had it.

3358
07:49:50,619 --> 07:49:51,659
This doesn't seem too bad.

3359
07:49:55,860 --> 07:49:59,650
Well, stop.

3360
07:49:59,650 --> 07:50:00,610
You're killing him.

3361
07:50:13,310 --> 07:50:14,959
Why can't I go forward?

3362
07:50:15,919 --> 07:50:17,200
What the fuck?

3363
07:50:18,159 --> 07:50:19,459
What am I doing wrong?

3364
07:50:27,389 --> 07:50:28,189
I need more air.

3365
07:50:32,130 --> 07:50:33,330
I had no air on that one.

3366
07:50:38,319 --> 07:50:39,040
I'm not holding anything.

3367
07:50:39,040 --> 07:50:40,560
I'm just doing L and R.

3368
07:50:41,279 --> 07:50:41,759
L and R.

3369
07:50:42,400 --> 07:50:54,349
Well, I get it.

3370
07:50:54,349 --> 07:50:54,750
I get it.

3371
07:50:55,709 --> 07:51:23,139
I'm starting to understand it, but fucking L and R is killing me.

3372
07:51:23,139 --> 07:51:24,740
Okay, L and R.

3373
07:51:27,840 --> 07:51:29,119
Give off as a controller.

3374
07:51:29,759 --> 07:51:46,909
The height of the jump?

3375
07:51:46,909 --> 07:51:47,790
I mean, all right.

3376
07:51:47,790 --> 07:51:50,430
So why am I doing the first one pretty much every single time,

3377
07:51:50,430 --> 07:51:51,470
but I can't do this one once?

3378
07:51:52,750 --> 07:52:02,819
I'm doing it too early?

3379
07:52:03,619 --> 07:52:04,340
Don't jump.

3380
07:52:05,299 --> 07:52:06,180
Wait, don't jump?

3381
07:52:07,459 --> 07:52:08,500
Why would I not?

3382
07:52:08,500 --> 07:52:09,540
Well, all right.

3383
07:52:09,540 --> 07:52:09,860
What?

3384
07:52:09,860 --> 07:52:10,340
What?

3385
07:52:10,340 --> 07:52:11,540
Why would I not jump?

3386
07:52:21,340 --> 07:52:22,540
Now score 100,000 points.

3387
07:52:23,340 --> 07:52:35,569
Now score 100,000 points.

3388
07:52:36,529 --> 07:52:38,000
Does it time?

3389
07:52:39,040 --> 07:52:39,810
Wait a minute.

3390
07:52:39,810 --> 07:52:40,529
What the fuck happened?

3391
07:52:41,409 --> 07:52:45,729
That whole...

3392
07:52:45,729 --> 07:52:47,729
Wait, the whole thing has to be a combo.

3393
07:52:48,610 --> 07:52:49,490
The entire thing.

3394
07:52:52,479 --> 07:52:53,759
Like from here down.

3395
07:52:56,540 --> 07:52:57,740
Oh, shit.

3396
07:52:57,740 --> 07:52:58,060
Okay.

3397
07:52:59,259 --> 07:53:00,220
Oh, boy.

3398
07:53:00,220 --> 07:53:02,779
I didn't really tacked on the fucking difficult shit

3399
07:53:02,779 --> 07:53:03,900
at the very end of the game, huh?

3400
07:53:04,939 --> 07:53:05,180
All right.

3401
07:53:05,180 --> 07:53:14,270
100,000.

3402
07:53:14,830 --> 07:53:15,630
I need a good line.

3403
07:53:16,590 --> 07:53:26,619
All right.

3404
07:53:26,619 --> 07:53:27,819
I'm not going to use Tony Hawk.

3405
07:53:27,819 --> 07:53:29,099
Who's got good street games?

3406
07:53:54,220 --> 07:53:55,979
Just do manual spam.

3407
07:53:55,979 --> 07:53:57,759
I'll still get off.

3408
07:53:57,759 --> 07:53:58,240
Hold on.

3409
07:53:58,799 --> 07:54:00,060
I'll try.

3410
07:54:00,060 --> 07:54:01,500
I'm going to try manual spam.

3411
07:54:02,319 --> 07:54:03,040
Oh, boy.

3412
07:54:03,040 --> 07:54:03,599
Here we go.

3413
07:54:25,009 --> 07:54:25,409
Different.

3414
07:54:25,409 --> 07:54:26,130
Do it with somebody else.

3415
07:54:26,770 --> 07:54:27,490
I don't want Tony Hawk.

3416
07:54:29,860 --> 07:54:30,819
Very patient car.

3417
07:54:31,540 --> 07:54:43,919
Tony Hawk?

3418
07:54:43,919 --> 07:54:46,240
I don't think has the best manual game.

3419
07:54:46,240 --> 07:54:54,220
The best game.

3420
07:54:54,220 --> 07:55:15,060
All right.

3421
07:55:15,060 --> 07:55:15,779
Let's get some manuals.

3422
07:55:15,779 --> 07:55:16,340
Here we go.

3423
07:55:16,340 --> 07:55:17,540
Three, two, one.

3424
07:55:17,540 --> 07:55:18,099
Start it.

3425
07:55:18,099 --> 07:55:45,009
Messed it up.

3426
07:55:45,009 --> 07:55:46,049
Same thing on the road.

3427
07:55:46,049 --> 07:55:46,770
All right.

3428
07:55:46,770 --> 07:55:47,250
Let's go.

3429
07:55:47,970 --> 07:55:59,090
There it is.

3430
07:55:59,090 --> 07:55:59,650
All right.

3431
07:55:59,650 --> 07:56:01,490
Jesus Christ.

3432
07:56:01,490 --> 07:56:06,939
Okay.

3433
07:56:06,939 --> 07:56:08,139
I need to do four more.

3434
07:56:08,139 --> 07:56:10,380
Hawaii Huge Spine Challenge.

3435
07:56:10,380 --> 07:56:10,939
Oh, no.

3436
07:56:10,939 --> 07:56:11,099
No.

3437
07:56:11,099 --> 07:56:13,409
Why does it have to be spine every time?

3438
07:56:13,409 --> 07:56:14,610
No spines.

3439
07:56:14,610 --> 07:56:16,450
I don't want to do spines.

3440
07:56:16,450 --> 07:56:20,529
The leap of faith's got nothing on this spy.

3441
07:56:20,529 --> 07:56:21,810
Roll off the end of the hotel

3442
07:56:21,810 --> 07:56:23,889
and acid drop to the quarter pipe below.

3443
07:56:24,849 --> 07:56:25,540
Okay.

3444
07:56:26,259 --> 07:56:28,259
Use that speed to spine up to the far roof

3445
07:56:28,259 --> 07:56:30,979
and then hit the next two spines in a row.

3446
07:56:30,979 --> 07:56:32,659
Who's got the nuts to try it?

3447
07:56:35,119 --> 07:56:36,799
You don't look like you're going fast enough to do this.

3448
07:56:37,919 --> 07:56:38,479
Tony Hawk.

3449
07:56:39,439 --> 07:56:47,360
All right.

3450
07:56:47,360 --> 07:56:48,000
Acid drop.

3451
07:56:56,779 --> 07:56:57,580
This one's kind of fun.

3452
07:56:59,330 --> 07:56:59,970
Acid drop.

3453
07:57:00,770 --> 07:57:08,459
Do it.

3454
07:57:08,459 --> 07:57:13,709
Just jump over.

3455
07:57:14,509 --> 07:57:20,779
Got it.

3456
07:57:21,580 --> 07:57:22,740
Now what?

3457
07:57:23,459 --> 07:57:24,240
Spine?

3458
07:57:24,240 --> 07:57:24,799
Now what?

3459
07:57:24,799 --> 07:57:27,520
The spine of acid drop before we move the first hotel spines

3460
07:57:27,520 --> 07:57:28,319
before time runs out.

3461
07:57:28,319 --> 07:57:29,119
Did I not do four?

3462
07:57:30,159 --> 07:57:38,669
Just a little one right here.

3463
07:57:39,389 --> 07:57:43,709
Why would that be part of it?

3464
07:57:44,750 --> 07:57:45,790
That's it.

3465
07:57:45,790 --> 07:57:53,229
Okay.

3466
07:57:53,229 --> 07:57:55,630
Florida Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Challenge.

3467
07:57:56,189 --> 07:58:02,639
Okay.

3468
07:58:02,639 --> 07:58:03,279
500,000 points.

3469
07:58:03,279 --> 07:58:04,560
Cool concept for someone's part.

3470
07:58:04,560 --> 07:58:06,319
Let's do it video game style.

3471
07:58:06,319 --> 07:58:08,479
We'll shoot four sick combo lines.

3472
07:58:09,599 --> 07:58:12,849
First combo, you can use whatever you want.

3473
07:58:12,849 --> 07:58:14,849
Next, only Tony Hawk three stuff.

3474
07:58:14,849 --> 07:58:16,290
No spine transfers.

3475
07:58:16,290 --> 07:58:18,130
Then only Tony Hawk two stuff.

3476
07:58:18,130 --> 07:58:19,810
No reverts or spine transfer.

3477
07:58:19,810 --> 07:58:20,610
I don't use them anyways.

3478
07:58:20,610 --> 07:58:22,770
Finally, only Tony Hawk one trick.

3479
07:58:23,250 --> 07:58:24,130
No manuals.

3480
07:58:25,970 --> 07:58:27,009
No manuals.

3481
07:58:30,290 --> 07:58:30,610
All right.

3482
07:58:31,650 --> 07:58:32,770
How about Van Margera?

3483
07:58:34,849 --> 07:58:35,409
30,000.

3484
07:58:36,770 --> 07:58:37,090
Okay.

3485
07:58:37,090 --> 07:58:38,529
Well, I didn't know we were going to go right now.

3486
07:58:39,810 --> 07:58:48,299
Okay.

3487
07:58:49,979 --> 07:59:16,020
Now no cat puke.

3488
07:59:20,130 --> 07:59:21,490
I'm just going to manual the first two.

3489
07:59:24,180 --> 07:59:24,819
All right.

3490
07:59:24,819 --> 07:59:26,740
Van Margera is not very good at manuals.

3491
07:59:26,740 --> 07:59:28,259
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

3492
07:59:28,900 --> 07:59:29,459
No, no, no, no, no.

3493
07:59:29,459 --> 07:59:30,340
I don't want, I'm going to save him.

3494
07:59:31,860 --> 07:59:36,000
Van Margera.

3495
07:59:36,720 --> 07:59:39,020
You said like BAM sucks?

3496
07:59:39,819 --> 07:59:48,590
I'm trying to get over it.

3497
07:59:48,590 --> 07:59:50,110
BAM's not good at anything.

3498
07:59:50,110 --> 07:59:51,229
Why don't I pick them?

3499
07:59:51,229 --> 07:59:51,470
What?

3500
07:59:52,189 --> 08:00:02,139
There's 68,000.

3501
08:00:02,139 --> 08:00:02,299
All right.

3502
08:00:02,299 --> 08:00:02,860
Let's do that again.

3503
08:00:08,080 --> 08:00:08,319
Man.

3504
08:00:09,860 --> 08:00:10,259
All right.

3505
08:00:10,259 --> 08:00:15,740
I'm going to have to, I can do that.

3506
08:00:15,740 --> 08:00:16,220
I can do it.

3507
08:00:16,220 --> 08:00:16,700
I can do it.

3508
08:00:16,700 --> 08:00:18,139
I'm not going to, I'm not going to rely on manuals.

3509
08:00:18,779 --> 08:00:19,659
Just for the first one, I will.

3510
08:00:20,380 --> 08:00:21,419
And did you see what just happened?

3511
08:00:22,139 --> 08:00:23,180
Magnet just grabbed that.

3512
08:00:36,369 --> 08:00:36,689
Okay.

3513
08:00:36,689 --> 08:00:37,490
Let's just do tricks.

3514
08:01:00,979 --> 08:01:02,979
Out of bounds game.

3515
08:01:02,979 --> 08:01:12,779
I got to do it with BAM.

3516
08:01:12,779 --> 08:01:13,180
I have to.

3517
08:01:21,540 --> 08:01:22,099
Did I fall?

3518
08:01:35,540 --> 08:01:36,259
Let's try that again.

3519
08:01:38,259 --> 08:01:39,619
Manuals really are the way to do it.

3520
08:01:39,619 --> 08:01:40,419
It seriously is.

3521
08:01:42,180 --> 08:01:42,740
Oh, fuck.

3522
08:01:52,139 --> 08:01:52,860
Okay.

3523
08:01:52,860 --> 08:01:53,099
Now.

3524
08:01:54,540 --> 08:01:55,659
No manuals.

3525
08:02:02,029 --> 08:02:02,750
Damn it.

3526
08:02:02,750 --> 08:02:03,470
I thought I had it.

3527
08:02:04,349 --> 08:02:08,590
Manuals are allowed?

3528
08:02:08,590 --> 08:02:08,830
Wait.

3529
08:02:10,529 --> 08:02:11,569
That was the third time though, right?

3530
08:02:11,569 --> 08:02:13,490
Was it a Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1?

3531
08:02:23,540 --> 08:02:24,180
Four of them, bro.

3532
08:02:25,779 --> 08:02:28,180
It's a normal Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1.

3533
08:03:07,970 --> 08:03:08,290
All right.

3534
08:03:09,169 --> 08:03:09,810
This is the one.

3535
08:03:10,689 --> 08:03:12,290
No manual, right?

3536
08:03:12,290 --> 08:03:14,930
This is no reverts, spine transfers, or walking.

3537
08:03:15,810 --> 08:03:16,770
This is the last one, right?

3538
08:03:20,139 --> 08:03:21,259
Can I still manual here?

3539
08:03:22,060 --> 08:03:24,430
Just infinite grind.

3540
08:03:24,990 --> 08:03:26,029
Just grind in a circle.

3541
08:03:27,549 --> 08:03:29,630
But where, I don't know where that line is, man.

3542
08:03:30,509 --> 08:03:31,389
Grind in a circle?

3543
08:03:34,209 --> 08:03:36,130
Oh, why did you guys even say that?

3544
08:03:36,849 --> 08:03:52,479
The tree thing?

3545
08:03:53,840 --> 08:04:04,020
The road median.

3546
08:04:14,979 --> 08:04:15,619
That's not good.

3547
08:04:19,139 --> 08:04:21,299
Right, right, right to my right.

3548
08:04:21,299 --> 08:04:21,799
Okay.

3549
08:04:23,299 --> 08:04:24,020
Forever grind.

3550
08:04:25,060 --> 08:04:37,869
This is fun though.

3551
08:04:39,759 --> 08:04:40,639
I like it.

3552
08:04:40,639 --> 08:04:42,959
It's hard, but it's not too hard for me to not be like,

3553
08:04:42,959 --> 08:04:43,919
I don't think I can do this.

3554
08:04:47,500 --> 08:04:51,580
All right.

3555
08:04:51,580 --> 08:04:52,380
I turned the wrong way.

3556
08:04:55,790 --> 08:04:58,750
It's fucking hard, but it's not like I can't do it.

3557
08:04:59,470 --> 08:05:00,349
I'll do it eventually.

3558
08:05:01,229 --> 08:05:05,169
Imagine this on stick.

3559
08:05:06,130 --> 08:05:22,029
Shit, I went off the side.

3560
08:05:23,069 --> 08:05:25,279
This is the least fun part of the game.

3561
08:05:27,060 --> 08:05:27,560
Yeah.

3562
08:05:28,099 --> 08:05:28,740
Yeah, it is.

3563
08:05:29,380 --> 08:05:30,580
It's still good though.

3564
08:05:30,580 --> 08:05:31,139
It's still fun.

3565
08:05:32,020 --> 08:05:37,840
It's still fun.

3566
08:05:37,840 --> 08:05:41,229
I mean, it makes you have to play well.

3567
08:05:42,909 --> 08:05:44,110
Did you learn anything, you know?

3568
08:05:44,110 --> 08:05:46,110
Did you learn whatever the game's trying to teach you?

3569
08:05:47,310 --> 08:05:51,790
It's good if you're good at the game.

3570
08:05:52,590 --> 08:05:55,599
Yeah, sure.

3571
08:06:06,659 --> 08:06:07,779
Times 13?

3572
08:06:07,779 --> 08:06:08,500
That's not, no.

3573
08:06:11,259 --> 08:06:12,540
Isn't that usually the case?

3574
08:06:15,310 --> 08:06:17,869
To get good at something, don't you have to do it

3575
08:06:17,869 --> 08:06:19,389
and play it and do it for a while?

3576
08:06:20,349 --> 08:06:21,619
How do you get good at anything?

3577
08:06:25,020 --> 08:06:27,020
You don't just start good at something.

3578
08:06:27,020 --> 08:06:27,919
That's not how it works.

3579
08:06:28,479 --> 08:06:41,740
I played all the Tony Hawk games.

3580
08:06:42,459 --> 08:06:42,959
Yes.

3581
08:06:43,819 --> 08:06:44,380
Yes, I did.

3582
08:06:45,500 --> 08:06:46,860
20 years ago.

3583
08:06:46,860 --> 08:06:51,090
And we did Tony Hawk 2 on the Dreamcast a year ago.

3584
08:06:57,439 --> 08:06:59,279
Yes, I've played all these games before.

3585
08:07:00,240 --> 08:07:02,319
Oh, when I was 17.

3586
08:07:17,389 --> 08:07:18,750
Okay, let's go.

3587
08:07:19,630 --> 08:07:20,110
The tree.

3588
08:07:21,340 --> 08:07:21,840
That's it.

3589
08:07:27,069 --> 08:07:30,819
Guys, this is a bad idea.

3590
08:07:31,979 --> 08:07:33,500
This is a very bad idea.

3591
08:07:33,500 --> 08:07:34,700
With Bam Margera?

3592
08:07:40,130 --> 08:07:41,250
Wait, do spam tricks?

3593
08:07:41,810 --> 08:07:42,930
What do you mean spam tricks?

3594
08:07:45,810 --> 08:08:02,860
Wait, what?

3595
08:08:02,860 --> 08:08:04,139
Wait, while you're grinding, I can do,

3596
08:08:04,139 --> 08:08:05,580
I can hold like X and Y and...

3597
08:08:09,630 --> 08:08:11,470
Oh man, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that shit.

3598
08:08:12,270 --> 08:08:17,119
I don't know if Bam can handle that.

3599
08:08:17,119 --> 08:08:29,659
I guess, okay, I can.

3600
08:08:29,659 --> 08:08:30,540
I can do it.

3601
08:08:30,540 --> 08:08:31,040
All right.

3602
08:08:31,500 --> 08:08:32,759
I can do it.

3603
08:08:40,189 --> 08:08:40,990
All right, I can do it.

3604
08:08:41,869 --> 08:08:43,779
I'll do it on the next run.

3605
08:08:44,419 --> 08:08:45,459
I have to get there again, though.

3606
08:08:46,099 --> 08:08:57,939
I don't know if Bam can handle this.

3607
08:08:57,939 --> 08:09:03,299
Just do something!

3608
08:09:03,299 --> 08:09:04,340
Do something!

3609
08:09:04,340 --> 08:09:26,189
Here we go.

3610
08:09:26,189 --> 08:09:26,830
Go.

3611
08:09:26,830 --> 08:09:48,939
San Diego Transfer Challenge.

3612
08:09:58,689 --> 08:09:59,330
Fuck you.

3613
08:09:59,330 --> 08:10:01,009
No one's ever shot at San Diego like this before.

3614
08:10:01,009 --> 08:10:01,490
Fuck you.

3615
08:10:01,490 --> 08:10:04,209
I've got filmers spread all across Balboa Park.

3616
08:10:04,209 --> 08:10:05,169
Is that how the song goes?

3617
08:10:06,290 --> 08:10:10,220
We just need a burly vert dog to try and hit all the transfers we've set up.

3618
08:10:10,939 --> 08:10:11,439
Okay.

3619
08:10:12,139 --> 08:10:13,419
Uh, Boston.

3620
08:10:13,419 --> 08:10:13,919
No.

3621
08:10:15,099 --> 08:10:17,299
Who has good air?

3622
08:10:17,299 --> 08:10:18,340
Boston versus Musco?

3623
08:10:20,340 --> 08:10:24,700
Probably Musco.

3624
08:10:28,130 --> 08:10:28,630
Neither.

3625
08:10:33,599 --> 08:10:35,439
Transvert transfer photoshoot.

3626
08:10:35,439 --> 08:10:36,080
No, I can do this.

3627
08:10:37,040 --> 08:10:37,759
Just hold R.

3628
08:10:38,479 --> 08:10:39,040
Or hit R.

3629
08:10:39,840 --> 08:10:41,700
Okay, there's one.

3630
08:10:42,259 --> 08:10:42,900
How many are there?

3631
08:10:44,959 --> 08:10:45,459
Over there.

3632
08:10:56,000 --> 08:10:57,119
He's praying for me.

3633
08:10:58,479 --> 08:11:02,630
Okay.

3634
08:11:02,630 --> 08:11:04,400
More of this way.

3635
08:11:07,580 --> 08:11:08,540
No, there isn't.

3636
08:11:08,540 --> 08:11:12,020
He's taking a picture to laugh at you.

3637
08:11:12,740 --> 08:11:14,139
Funny LML comedy.

3638
08:11:14,139 --> 08:11:15,099
Fucking comedy moment.

3639
08:11:15,979 --> 08:11:20,830
A little too far.

3640
08:11:24,159 --> 08:11:24,959
I still got it?

3641
08:11:24,959 --> 08:11:25,459
I got it.

3642
08:11:26,080 --> 08:11:27,630
Fuck you, buddy.

3643
08:11:29,540 --> 08:11:30,900
You're in Tony Hawk's way.

3644
08:11:31,700 --> 08:11:33,590
Wait.

3645
08:11:33,590 --> 08:11:34,209
Oh, do I have to...

3646
08:11:34,770 --> 08:11:43,439
Come on.

3647
08:11:44,299 --> 08:11:46,459
Get out of the fucking way.

3648
08:11:46,459 --> 08:11:47,900
Matthew McConaughey is on his way.

3649
08:11:49,020 --> 08:11:50,529
I got it.

3650
08:11:51,150 --> 08:11:53,229
Not very good, but I still got it.

3651
08:11:54,029 --> 08:12:08,669
Okay, let me just slow down and do this the way it should be done.

3652
08:12:11,540 --> 08:12:12,040
Okay.

3653
08:12:25,630 --> 08:12:28,189
Uh, so how bad is Causton's air again?

3654
08:12:28,189 --> 08:12:28,750
Somebody said.

3655
08:12:56,860 --> 08:12:57,360
Here?

3656
08:12:57,900 --> 08:13:03,700
Over here?

3657
08:13:04,319 --> 08:13:08,450
I don't see anything over here.

3658
08:13:15,860 --> 08:13:16,659
They're on the roof?

3659
08:13:17,380 --> 08:13:17,880
No.

3660
08:13:21,680 --> 08:13:22,479
Wait, what about in here?

3661
08:13:23,759 --> 08:13:26,750
I mean, that could be one.

3662
08:13:26,750 --> 08:13:27,250
Oh.

3663
08:13:38,819 --> 08:13:39,319
This one?

3664
08:13:41,729 --> 08:13:43,419
It's not up here.

3665
08:13:43,419 --> 08:13:43,979
Yeah, this...

3666
08:13:43,979 --> 08:13:44,700
Where else would it be?

3667
08:13:46,139 --> 08:14:04,509
Over here?

3668
08:14:04,509 --> 08:14:11,919
Oh, there's one over here.

3669
08:14:11,919 --> 08:14:12,560
Only one?

3670
08:14:13,520 --> 08:14:22,770
There's a corner one.

3671
08:14:23,569 --> 08:14:28,720
What is...

3672
08:14:30,619 --> 08:14:32,060
I haven't even seen what the hell I'm supposed to be doing.

3673
08:14:32,060 --> 08:14:33,740
You want me to go from here to here?

3674
08:14:35,279 --> 08:14:36,159
Wait, what does he want me to do?

3675
08:14:42,939 --> 08:14:43,439
Over the...

3676
08:14:46,220 --> 08:14:47,180
Up on the roof.

3677
08:14:47,900 --> 08:14:48,900
Oh.

3678
08:14:49,619 --> 08:14:50,500
Over the roof.

3679
08:14:52,290 --> 08:14:53,009
Well, shit.

3680
08:14:53,009 --> 08:14:53,509
Okay.

3681
08:15:20,209 --> 08:15:20,709
In here?

3682
08:15:22,830 --> 08:15:23,869
We'll just delete the cars.

3683
08:15:26,540 --> 08:15:27,340
Three stair ones.

3684
08:15:28,060 --> 08:15:48,200
Okay.

3685
08:15:49,060 --> 08:15:50,099
There's another one back here.

3686
08:15:50,900 --> 08:15:54,299
And I've skated by it.

3687
08:16:11,069 --> 08:16:11,569
Okay.

3688
08:16:13,020 --> 08:16:14,700
Now, go up on the roof.

3689
08:16:16,529 --> 08:16:17,330
Over back here.

3690
08:16:18,540 --> 08:16:19,040
Good.

3691
08:16:19,580 --> 08:16:22,740
Was there one?

3692
08:16:22,740 --> 08:16:23,619
Wait, is there one over here?

3693
08:16:24,500 --> 08:16:25,889
I don't think I looked over here.

3694
08:16:26,610 --> 08:16:44,779
What does he mean?

3695
08:16:44,779 --> 08:16:45,500
He misused it.

3696
08:16:46,540 --> 08:16:52,610
What the hell are you trying to do?

3697
08:16:52,610 --> 08:16:53,009
All right.

3698
08:16:53,009 --> 08:16:53,729
Over the roof?

3699
08:16:54,450 --> 08:16:57,500
Over the roof?

3700
08:16:58,990 --> 08:17:00,590
Just a spine transfer?

3701
08:17:01,470 --> 08:17:18,209
From here to there?

3702
08:17:21,229 --> 08:17:22,110
Through the opening?

3703
08:17:22,909 --> 08:17:31,200
Ram.

3704
08:17:31,740 --> 08:17:33,150
Not a spine transfer.

3705
08:17:33,150 --> 08:17:34,669
Yeah, you're supposed to go from bird to bird.

3706
08:17:35,869 --> 08:17:36,349
This one?

3707
08:17:36,349 --> 08:17:37,229
Like, from here to here?

3708
08:17:38,830 --> 08:17:39,630
It's probably that one.

3709
08:17:40,270 --> 08:17:47,819
He's not even aiming the camera over here.

3710
08:17:49,819 --> 08:17:52,750
Is there one on the other side?

3711
08:17:53,470 --> 08:18:09,700
I don't get it.

3712
08:18:11,619 --> 08:18:12,740
The roof has a ramp.

3713
08:18:13,779 --> 08:18:14,279
What is it?

3714
08:18:15,060 --> 08:18:15,779
Like, here?

3715
08:18:17,060 --> 08:18:17,860
Oh, okay.

3716
08:18:17,860 --> 08:18:18,340
That.

3717
08:18:18,340 --> 08:18:18,819
I see.

3718
08:18:18,819 --> 08:18:19,939
All right, all right, all right.

3719
08:18:19,939 --> 08:18:20,580
So I have to go.

3720
08:18:21,540 --> 08:18:21,939
Now I know.

3721
08:18:24,979 --> 08:18:31,220
Wasn't it?

3722
08:18:31,919 --> 08:18:34,380
Wait.

3723
08:18:34,380 --> 08:18:35,099
How is that not it?

3724
08:18:35,819 --> 08:18:42,049
Other side?

3725
08:18:43,009 --> 08:18:47,889
So you want me to come up from that side?

3726
08:18:47,889 --> 08:18:48,389
Okay.

3727
08:18:55,979 --> 08:18:56,479
This side.

3728
08:19:00,380 --> 08:19:01,180
I know where it is now.

3729
08:19:10,130 --> 08:19:11,729
Well, I killed the photographer.

3730
08:19:12,529 --> 08:19:26,000
There's one.

3731
08:19:27,869 --> 08:19:28,909
That still doesn't solve the problem.

3732
08:19:28,909 --> 08:19:30,349
There's this two more somewhere.

3733
08:19:33,220 --> 08:19:35,540
Where on earth are the last two that I haven't seen?

3734
08:19:49,599 --> 08:20:02,580
I didn't do the first one?

3735
08:20:02,580 --> 08:20:03,080
That's bad.

3736
08:20:03,080 --> 08:20:04,259
I can go back and get it.

3737
08:20:11,840 --> 08:20:12,959
I'm going to call a legend.

3738
08:20:12,959 --> 08:20:16,180
Dominance before it gives me a warm reception.

3739
08:20:16,180 --> 08:20:17,380
Double war with weapons.

3740
08:20:17,380 --> 08:20:18,400
Give me shit.

3741
08:20:18,400 --> 08:20:19,200
Throw him the sword.

3742
08:20:19,200 --> 08:20:20,240
Dust him just as well.

3743
08:20:20,240 --> 08:20:25,549
That fucking car.

3744
08:20:25,549 --> 08:20:26,669
No, that fucked that car.

3745
08:20:30,830 --> 08:20:31,869
Fuck that car.

3746
08:20:31,869 --> 08:20:33,229
That ruined everything.

3747
08:20:33,229 --> 08:20:34,029
Unless I can get this one.

3748
08:20:42,159 --> 08:20:42,659
Eww.

3749
08:20:43,360 --> 08:20:51,490
How did there be a mission here?

3750
08:20:51,490 --> 08:20:51,990
I don't know.

3751
08:21:01,119 --> 08:21:02,189
I'm going to fall again.

3752
08:21:03,150 --> 08:21:07,169
Should I just do it?

3753
08:21:20,189 --> 08:21:20,750
All right.

3754
08:21:20,750 --> 08:21:23,150
Now go this way.

3755
08:21:23,869 --> 08:21:24,430
Up and in?

3756
08:21:25,470 --> 08:21:32,459
These guys are going to have a bad day.

3757
08:21:32,459 --> 08:21:33,819
I did it?

3758
08:21:33,819 --> 08:21:34,779
Did he get the photo?

3759
08:21:35,740 --> 08:21:36,540
Did he get the photo?

3760
08:21:39,200 --> 08:21:39,919
Okay.

3761
08:21:39,919 --> 08:21:40,419
He got it.

3762
08:21:41,119 --> 08:21:45,630
Now where are the last?

3763
08:21:45,630 --> 08:21:46,669
I know one back there I didn't do.

3764
08:21:46,669 --> 08:21:47,869
But where are the last two?

3765
08:21:48,509 --> 08:21:50,700
Is that a photographer?

3766
08:21:51,419 --> 08:22:01,099
Up here?

3767
08:22:02,139 --> 08:22:06,419
Let's just spine up here.

3768
08:22:15,040 --> 08:22:15,680
Shit.

3769
08:22:15,680 --> 08:22:16,560
I see one there.

3770
08:22:17,279 --> 08:22:18,000
There's nobody here.

3771
08:22:18,639 --> 08:22:23,020
There's one up there though.

3772
08:22:23,020 --> 08:22:29,979
Where did I see that?

3773
08:22:29,979 --> 08:22:32,770
Isn't that like up there?

3774
08:22:35,169 --> 08:22:54,470
Yeah.

3775
08:23:01,119 --> 08:23:10,529
I gotta get up here.

3776
08:23:11,409 --> 08:23:15,310
So I need just a view.

3777
08:23:16,270 --> 08:23:24,060
Is one in there?

3778
08:23:24,060 --> 08:23:24,459
All right.

3779
08:23:24,459 --> 08:23:24,959
In there.

3780
08:23:25,580 --> 08:23:28,340
Wasn't I in here already?

3781
08:23:29,060 --> 08:23:32,430
Oh, this motherfucker is right here.

3782
08:23:33,549 --> 08:23:34,110
Oh, man.

3783
08:23:34,110 --> 08:23:34,909
They're both right here.

3784
08:23:38,209 --> 08:23:38,849
All right.

3785
08:23:38,849 --> 08:23:39,569
Let's go.

3786
08:23:39,569 --> 08:23:44,049
That's too bad.

3787
08:23:44,049 --> 08:23:45,729
There's no ramp on that side.

3788
08:23:46,770 --> 08:23:48,290
No ramp on that side.

3789
08:23:48,290 --> 08:23:49,250
Just take it slow.

3790
08:23:50,849 --> 08:23:54,020
I did it.

3791
08:23:57,819 --> 08:23:58,319
Last one.

3792
08:24:00,610 --> 08:24:02,849
Jersey spine trick spot challenge.

3793
08:24:02,849 --> 08:24:04,529
Big apple spot challenge.

3794
08:24:05,330 --> 08:24:07,889
Slam a jam of Moscow's lost tapes.

3795
08:24:08,610 --> 08:24:11,409
I'm not going to be able to do it.

3796
08:24:11,409 --> 08:24:12,770
No, there's no way.

3797
08:24:12,770 --> 08:24:13,810
I'm not capable of that.

3798
08:24:17,810 --> 08:24:20,049
Who wants to leave his mark on red square?

3799
08:24:20,049 --> 08:24:21,409
There's no way I'll do big apple.

3800
08:24:21,409 --> 08:24:22,049
I'm sorry.

3801
08:24:22,049 --> 08:24:23,250
This is not going to happen.

3802
08:24:26,610 --> 08:24:28,049
Those ledges are rough.

3803
08:24:28,049 --> 08:24:29,729
So make sure you warm up before you go.

3804
08:24:31,090 --> 08:24:31,810
All right, Muska.

3805
08:24:32,529 --> 08:24:33,090
Ten tapes.

3806
08:24:34,290 --> 08:24:42,259
I feel like Muska doesn't have very good grind.

3807
08:24:49,630 --> 08:24:50,130
Oh, boy.

3808
08:24:50,990 --> 08:25:04,209
What would that even happen?

3809
08:25:36,020 --> 08:25:38,419
Don't tell me what.

3810
08:25:38,419 --> 08:25:39,700
You can't come in here with that.

3811
08:25:40,259 --> 08:25:41,299
Don't tell him what.

3812
08:25:41,939 --> 08:25:43,299
Why you can't come in here with that?

3813
08:25:45,279 --> 08:25:45,680
What is it?

3814
08:25:45,680 --> 08:25:46,479
Why are you saying that?

3815
08:25:47,040 --> 08:25:59,180
He doesn't know.

3816
08:25:59,979 --> 08:26:00,860
I mean, I do.

3817
08:26:01,740 --> 08:26:05,279
How do I look at a character's stats?

3818
08:26:05,279 --> 08:26:19,459
Oh, no.

3819
08:26:38,659 --> 08:26:50,400
This buster.

3820
08:27:00,419 --> 08:27:01,459
He's not good for this.

3821
08:27:02,740 --> 08:27:04,180
What was slam a jam on again?

3822
08:27:04,180 --> 08:27:04,680
No.

3823
08:27:05,220 --> 08:27:05,540
What?

3824
08:27:05,540 --> 08:27:07,459
Jersey spine trick spot challenge.

3825
08:27:07,459 --> 08:27:08,340
I didn't even look at this one.

3826
08:27:08,900 --> 08:27:16,959
Peralta was right.

3827
08:27:16,959 --> 08:27:18,959
This old spine is a big ghetto,

3828
08:27:18,959 --> 08:27:21,200
but it'll definitely turn heads if one of you guys can get.

3829
08:27:21,200 --> 08:27:23,439
I mean, he is sideways tricks as you go over it

3830
08:27:23,439 --> 08:27:25,759
and we'll have a killer part to lead off the team video.

3831
08:27:27,360 --> 08:27:27,599
All right.

3832
08:27:27,599 --> 08:27:28,560
What do we need to do?

3833
08:27:28,560 --> 08:27:30,720
Hit the tricks over the train station spine.

3834
08:27:40,180 --> 08:28:00,130
Wait, I guess there's a secret level over there.

3835
08:28:00,849 --> 08:28:11,490
Look at that.

3836
08:28:11,490 --> 08:28:18,080
Look at that.

3837
08:28:18,080 --> 08:28:19,970
This is going to be it.

3838
08:28:19,970 --> 08:28:24,000
That's it.

3839
08:28:24,939 --> 08:28:26,060
Oh, I did it.

3840
08:28:26,060 --> 08:28:26,779
I did it.

3841
08:28:27,740 --> 08:28:30,459
I beat Tony Hawk's pro skater underground.

3842
08:28:31,180 --> 08:28:32,959
But that didn't work.

3843
08:28:47,150 --> 08:28:48,349
I can't even say, like,

3844
08:28:50,430 --> 08:28:51,790
I don't know how it goes that fast.

3845
08:28:55,180 --> 08:28:56,860
Once you do it fast enough, stop.

3846
08:28:57,580 --> 08:29:04,639
Let's take a look at our sick video, man.

3847
08:29:06,290 --> 08:29:07,409
Blush force video.

3848
08:29:09,409 --> 08:29:11,569
I'm Chad Muska.

3849
08:29:12,369 --> 08:29:22,189
Oh, sick.

3850
08:29:22,189 --> 08:29:23,310
And then we took that photo.

3851
08:29:24,430 --> 08:29:26,180
Nice, Tony.

3852
08:29:26,979 --> 08:29:34,580
Sick.

3853
08:29:38,020 --> 08:29:40,020
Oh, that was clean.

3854
08:29:46,080 --> 08:29:53,279
Oh, yeah.

3855
08:29:54,080 --> 08:29:58,509
Now do the thing where you fall forward on the front part of your neck

3856
08:29:58,509 --> 08:30:00,349
and your legs kick you in the back of the head.

3857
08:30:00,990 --> 08:30:02,349
We've got a lot of footage of that.

3858
08:30:02,909 --> 08:30:03,869
Did the editor put it in?

3859
08:30:08,270 --> 08:30:08,909
Eric Costin.

3860
08:30:08,909 --> 08:30:09,310
Let's see it.

3861
08:30:09,950 --> 08:30:17,439
That shit is so hard.

3862
08:30:17,439 --> 08:30:18,959
It's so difficult to do this stuff.

3863
08:30:19,680 --> 08:30:25,889
That's beautiful.

3864
08:30:25,889 --> 08:30:30,450
That was a manual all the way.

3865
08:30:35,650 --> 08:30:36,770
Skateboarding's fun to watch.

3866
08:30:39,009 --> 08:30:43,009
Yeah, it's just, it's a craft.

3867
08:30:43,009 --> 08:30:43,810
It's an art form.

3868
08:30:48,959 --> 08:30:49,279
Wow.

3869
08:30:50,240 --> 08:30:51,569
No fucking way.

3870
08:30:52,130 --> 08:30:56,450
All right, bam.

3871
08:30:56,450 --> 08:30:56,849
Let's see it.

3872
08:30:57,889 --> 08:30:58,770
Oh, there we go.

3873
08:31:00,909 --> 08:31:01,229
Yep.

3874
08:31:01,229 --> 08:31:03,229
This is where all that footage went.

3875
08:31:03,229 --> 08:31:09,069
It just like falls down.

3876
08:31:09,069 --> 08:31:12,080
Accurate replay.

3877
08:31:12,080 --> 08:31:17,779
Remember when I rode the ATV?

3878
08:31:17,779 --> 08:31:19,779
Oh, shit there.

3879
08:31:19,779 --> 08:31:27,009
Remember when I drove the car like that?

3880
08:31:27,009 --> 08:31:36,099
Nice.

3881
08:31:36,099 --> 08:31:39,680
You know how much that hurts your back?

3882
08:31:39,680 --> 08:31:44,159
Planting from that high.

3883
08:31:44,159 --> 08:31:53,819
Do I get one too?

3884
08:31:53,819 --> 08:31:59,520
You've got to be kidding me.

3885
08:31:59,520 --> 08:32:02,849
That was phenomenal.

3886
08:32:02,849 --> 08:32:04,849
How do humans do this?

3887
08:32:04,849 --> 08:32:13,360
How do humans do this?

3888
08:32:13,360 --> 08:32:15,360
All right, this dude is a video game.

3889
08:32:15,360 --> 08:32:18,880
Actual video game character right here.

3890
08:32:18,880 --> 08:32:37,630
Cardi Mullen is the greatest of all time in the street.

3891
08:32:37,630 --> 08:32:40,130
Holy shit, that was awesome.

3892
08:32:40,130 --> 08:32:42,130
I just kind of wanted to watch these.

3893
08:32:42,130 --> 08:32:44,130
I just want to watch skateboarding videos now.

3894
08:32:44,130 --> 08:33:02,049
You can just do those little transfers over.

3895
08:33:02,049 --> 08:33:04,049
Little railings.

3896
08:33:04,049 --> 08:33:07,500
This shit is so dangerous.

3897
08:33:07,500 --> 08:33:11,500
But completely captivating at the same time.

3898
08:33:11,500 --> 08:33:17,119
Uh oh.

3899
08:33:17,119 --> 08:33:19,119
Illegal picnic basket jump.

3900
08:33:37,490 --> 08:33:43,569
Here comes my video.

3901
08:33:43,569 --> 08:33:45,569
I saw him do a royal flush and he got arrested.

3902
08:34:03,889 --> 08:34:05,889
You blew every cent you own on that car.

3903
08:34:05,889 --> 08:34:07,889
That was a mistake.

3904
08:34:26,619 --> 08:34:28,619
Cigarettes?

3905
08:34:28,619 --> 08:34:30,619
Oh, my cassette tape.

3906
08:34:36,619 --> 08:34:38,619
What do you say?

3907
08:34:38,619 --> 08:34:40,619
One last trip around the neighborhood.

3908
08:34:40,619 --> 08:34:43,250
Winner takes the tape.

3909
08:34:43,250 --> 08:34:45,549
All right, one last trip.

3910
08:34:45,549 --> 08:34:47,549
I've waited a long time for this.

3911
08:34:47,549 --> 08:34:49,549
I'm gonna light you up.

3912
08:34:49,549 --> 08:34:51,549
I'm gonna light you up, homie.

3913
08:34:53,919 --> 08:35:02,110
Oh, boy.

3914
08:35:02,110 --> 08:35:05,439
Why does he have to fire?

3915
08:35:05,439 --> 08:35:07,439
He's throwing, like, grenades at me.

3916
08:35:07,439 --> 08:35:20,689
That's not fair. I don't get grenades.

3917
08:35:20,689 --> 08:35:22,689
Oh, shit!

3918
08:35:22,689 --> 08:35:24,689
He's up top.

3919
08:35:24,689 --> 08:35:44,979
He's up top.

3920
08:35:44,979 --> 08:35:52,340
He's got a hit. Jump over it.

3921
08:35:52,340 --> 08:35:57,330
Hit the line.

3922
08:36:02,580 --> 08:36:05,520
He's fucking schooling me right now.

3923
08:36:05,520 --> 08:36:13,779
I mean, but...

3924
08:36:13,779 --> 08:36:21,069
This is gonna be rough.

3925
08:36:21,069 --> 08:36:34,500
Two hours later.

3926
08:36:34,500 --> 08:36:36,500
I kinda hope not.

3927
08:36:36,500 --> 08:36:38,500
It's really just the end of the game.

3928
08:36:38,500 --> 08:36:40,500
I'm trying to jump through those.

3929
08:36:40,500 --> 08:36:42,500
It's giving me a lot of trouble.

3930
08:36:44,500 --> 08:36:46,500
Why does he have Molotov?

3931
08:36:46,500 --> 08:36:48,500
Molotov?

3932
08:36:50,500 --> 08:36:52,500
That's a great question.

3933
08:36:52,500 --> 08:36:54,500
To make this

3934
08:36:54,500 --> 08:36:56,500
already difficult

3935
08:36:56,500 --> 08:36:58,500
way more difficult.

3936
08:36:58,500 --> 08:37:00,500
Something like that.

3937
08:37:09,700 --> 08:37:11,700
I'm gonna stop getting off that.

3938
08:37:11,700 --> 08:37:13,700
All right, here we go.

3939
08:37:15,700 --> 08:37:17,700
Here we go.

3940
08:37:19,700 --> 08:37:24,560
Jesus Christ!

3941
08:37:24,560 --> 08:37:26,740
What? Oh, no!

3942
08:37:26,740 --> 08:37:35,889
The power lines.

3943
08:37:35,889 --> 08:37:44,849
I don't think I can even get up there anymore.

3944
08:37:44,849 --> 08:37:49,840
Hold on. Time for that one.

3945
08:37:49,840 --> 08:37:51,840
Not even halfway there, either.

3946
08:37:51,840 --> 08:37:56,580
Two minutes, too.

3947
08:37:56,580 --> 08:38:08,220
I'd stay up here.

3948
08:38:08,220 --> 08:38:16,270
Did I not get it?

3949
08:38:16,270 --> 08:38:18,270
Yeah, I can't get this part down.

3950
08:38:18,270 --> 08:38:20,270
I could jump through.

3951
08:38:20,270 --> 08:38:22,270
Where does he jump? He jumps right here.

3952
08:38:22,270 --> 08:38:31,740
He hits me like that every time.

3953
08:38:31,740 --> 08:38:33,919
Rhythm Heaven?

3954
08:38:33,919 --> 08:38:35,919
This is probably...

3955
08:38:35,919 --> 08:38:37,919
I would probably put this...

3956
08:38:37,919 --> 08:38:47,900
This is probably harder than Rhythm Heaven. Did I not get it?

3957
08:38:47,900 --> 08:38:49,900
I don't think I got that one.

3958
08:38:49,900 --> 08:38:59,939
No, I didn't.

3959
08:38:59,939 --> 08:39:18,500
All right, save.

3960
08:39:18,500 --> 08:39:20,500
I'm just gonna try to stay with him.

3961
08:39:20,500 --> 08:39:22,930
I could jump over it, too.

3962
08:39:22,930 --> 08:39:29,650
The whole screen.

3963
08:39:29,650 --> 08:39:36,240
As long as you're in the vicinity, you get it.

3964
08:39:36,240 --> 08:39:39,119
Here he goes. Didn't get it.

3965
08:39:39,119 --> 08:39:42,430
Oh, man.

3966
08:39:42,430 --> 08:39:46,270
This might...

3967
08:39:46,270 --> 08:39:48,270
I'm not sure a nine-hour stream Jeremy can beat this level.

3968
08:39:48,270 --> 08:39:51,340
I'm not sure this is gonna happen.

3969
08:39:51,340 --> 08:39:53,580
I don't know if a nine-hour stream Jeremy can complete this.

3970
08:39:53,580 --> 08:39:55,580
I'll try for another 30 minutes or so.

3971
08:39:55,580 --> 08:40:02,750
Let's see if I can get it.

3972
08:40:02,750 --> 08:40:11,259
Watch out.

3973
08:40:11,259 --> 08:40:21,569
Up the wall.

3974
08:40:21,569 --> 08:40:23,569
I think it's over.

3975
08:40:23,569 --> 08:40:28,369
Unless I can stay...

3976
08:40:28,369 --> 08:40:35,790
It's hard to see the wires.

3977
08:40:35,790 --> 08:40:41,040
The wires are almost just blended with the background.

3978
08:40:41,040 --> 08:40:43,040
I can't even see them.

3979
08:40:43,040 --> 08:40:45,040
Level up my stats.

3980
08:40:45,040 --> 08:40:49,009
Where are all my stats?

3981
08:40:49,009 --> 08:40:51,009
I can't even see them.

3982
08:40:51,009 --> 08:40:54,340
Air spin. They're all really good.

3983
08:40:54,340 --> 08:40:58,110
Run, flip, ray.

3984
08:40:58,110 --> 08:41:00,110
Actually, rail is really not that good.

3985
08:41:00,110 --> 08:41:02,110
Crying for 15 seconds.

3986
08:41:02,110 --> 08:41:04,110
Crying for 20 seconds.

3987
08:41:04,110 --> 08:41:09,490
Crying for 20 seconds.

3988
08:41:09,490 --> 08:41:11,490
Haven't done that yet.

3989
08:41:11,490 --> 08:41:19,229
No, I got it.

3990
08:41:19,229 --> 08:41:41,040
I...

3991
08:41:41,040 --> 08:41:43,040
I mean, I'm gonna try.

3992
08:41:43,040 --> 08:41:51,299
And when he abandoned you in Russia...

3993
08:41:51,299 --> 08:41:53,299
I do. It was bad.

3994
08:41:53,299 --> 08:42:12,619
Yeah.

3995
08:42:12,619 --> 08:42:14,619
I think nine hours straight Tony Hawk Jeremy.

3996
08:42:14,619 --> 08:42:16,799
I think it's time to go to bed, son.

3997
08:42:16,799 --> 08:42:18,799
You've been up all day playing Tony Hawk, son.

3998
08:42:18,799 --> 08:42:20,799
You can beat the last level another time.

3999
08:42:20,799 --> 08:42:22,799
You've been up all day playing Tony Hawk, son.

4000
08:42:22,799 --> 08:42:25,229
You can beat the last level another time.

4001
08:42:25,229 --> 08:42:27,229
No, I can do it. I can do it, dad.

4002
08:42:27,229 --> 08:42:31,630
Son, it's okay.

4003
08:42:31,630 --> 08:42:34,700
You don't have to beat it right now.

4004
08:42:34,700 --> 08:42:42,619
I missed.

4005
08:42:42,619 --> 08:42:53,380
Shut up, dad.

4006
08:42:53,380 --> 08:42:55,380
Are you your own dad?

4007
08:42:55,380 --> 08:43:00,930
It'd be odd, wouldn't it?

4008
08:43:00,930 --> 08:43:02,930
This is the part that I get caught up on every time.

4009
08:43:02,930 --> 08:43:05,299
Up, and then drive?

4010
08:43:05,299 --> 08:43:08,560
Drive? No.

4011
08:43:08,560 --> 08:43:10,560
The worst thing is if you miss it,

4012
08:43:10,560 --> 08:43:13,700
it's just over.

4013
08:43:13,700 --> 08:43:16,639
Turn the music off.

4014
08:43:16,639 --> 08:43:22,080
Alright, I'm gonna try it without music.

4015
08:43:22,080 --> 08:43:37,310
Just skateboard sounds.

4016
08:43:37,310 --> 08:43:39,310
I'm just trying not to do any tricks.

4017
08:43:39,310 --> 08:43:43,540
I'm just trying to grind and just stay...

4018
08:43:43,540 --> 08:43:45,540
I'm not trying to do anything fancy.

4019
08:43:45,540 --> 08:43:52,939
Alright, every time.

4020
08:43:52,939 --> 08:43:56,779
That stays on it.

4021
08:43:56,779 --> 08:44:00,240
I don't know.

4022
08:44:00,240 --> 08:44:02,240
So he just, he doesn't jump or anything.

4023
08:44:02,240 --> 08:44:04,240
He just stays on the line.

4024
08:44:04,240 --> 08:44:06,240
It just rips him to the...

4025
08:44:06,240 --> 08:44:10,590
I just didn't have any speed.

4026
08:44:10,590 --> 08:44:16,860
I was gonna fall off anyways.

4027
08:44:16,860 --> 08:44:22,500
Alright, 10 more attempts

4028
08:44:22,500 --> 08:44:25,569
and I'm gonna do this tomorrow.

4029
08:44:25,569 --> 08:44:27,569
I'm out of gas, man.

4030
08:44:27,569 --> 08:44:32,819
I just am.

4031
08:44:32,819 --> 08:44:34,819
I was probably out of gas like 40 minutes ago.

4032
08:44:34,819 --> 08:44:37,250
But I should be able to do this tomorrow.

4033
08:44:37,250 --> 08:44:39,250
After eating a good breakfast.

4034
08:44:39,250 --> 08:44:44,619
Cheats? No.

4035
08:44:44,619 --> 08:44:46,619
I cheat?

4036
08:44:46,619 --> 08:44:52,450
Why would I cheat?

4037
08:44:52,450 --> 08:45:05,250
You can still make it.

4038
08:45:05,250 --> 08:45:09,020
What about Helm's Deep?

4039
08:45:09,020 --> 08:45:11,020
That's a different kind of game though.

4040
08:45:11,020 --> 08:45:13,500
This requires

4041
08:45:13,500 --> 08:45:15,500
a huge amount of

4042
08:45:15,500 --> 08:45:17,500
concentration.

4043
08:45:17,500 --> 08:45:19,500
Helm's Deep was just running in circles kicking ladders.

4044
08:45:19,500 --> 08:45:22,000
So it's a little

4045
08:45:22,000 --> 08:45:26,029
different.

4046
08:45:26,029 --> 08:45:33,330
Just get the funny bad ending.

4047
08:45:33,330 --> 08:45:35,569
Funny bad ending?

4048
08:45:35,569 --> 08:45:41,580
Just do the

4049
08:45:41,580 --> 08:45:43,580
infinite grind cheat.

4050
08:45:43,580 --> 08:45:49,520
6

4051
08:45:49,520 --> 08:45:52,270
5

4052
08:45:52,270 --> 08:45:58,349
How far am I gonna go?

4053
08:45:58,349 --> 08:46:16,209
5, son.

4054
08:46:16,209 --> 08:46:18,209
I don't reliably get it

4055
08:46:18,209 --> 08:46:20,209
to be able to get up there.

4056
08:46:20,209 --> 08:46:22,209
It's something to do with how I'm jumping or how...

4057
08:46:22,209 --> 08:46:33,279
I don't understand.

4058
08:46:33,279 --> 08:46:35,279
Don't let the pervert skateboarder win.

4059
08:46:35,279 --> 08:46:37,520
Did I miss that?

4060
08:46:37,520 --> 08:46:39,819
Why am I reading chat right now?

4061
08:46:39,819 --> 08:46:43,340
I think I've clocked out.

4062
08:46:43,340 --> 08:46:45,340
I'm just looking over there.

4063
08:46:45,340 --> 08:46:50,720
What are people saying?

4064
08:46:50,720 --> 08:46:52,720
I'm teleporting up to the top of the building

4065
08:46:52,720 --> 08:46:54,720
instead of the pipe that I'm trying to grind on.

4066
08:46:54,720 --> 08:47:02,590
There's another ramp to the right?

4067
08:47:02,590 --> 08:47:04,590
I'm supposed to be doing his

4068
08:47:04,590 --> 08:47:06,590
line, right?

4069
08:47:06,590 --> 08:47:12,220
Aren't I supposed to follow him to grab these things?

4070
08:47:12,220 --> 08:47:17,919
Get a grind

4071
08:47:17,919 --> 08:47:19,919
to gutter. That's what I'm trying to do.

4072
08:47:19,919 --> 08:47:21,919
That keeps on going up to the top of the roof.

4073
08:47:21,919 --> 08:47:25,700
See what he does here?

4074
08:47:25,700 --> 08:47:27,869
I did it, but...

4075
08:47:27,869 --> 08:47:29,869
Alright, you know, I'm not gonna restart.

4076
08:47:29,869 --> 08:47:31,869
Let me just look at this.

4077
08:47:31,869 --> 08:47:33,869
I feel like I've done the same...

4078
08:47:33,869 --> 08:47:39,889
He rips to the right.

4079
08:47:39,889 --> 08:47:41,889
When he gets up there, he goes like this.

4080
08:47:41,889 --> 08:47:46,689
And he goes like...

4081
08:47:46,689 --> 08:47:48,930
Like...

4082
08:47:48,930 --> 08:48:05,250
What's that?

4083
08:48:05,250 --> 08:48:07,250
You gotta get on it?

4084
08:48:07,250 --> 08:48:24,400
Let me just practice.

4085
08:48:24,400 --> 08:48:26,400
If I just spam Y,

4086
08:48:26,400 --> 08:48:32,479
it takes me over here.

4087
08:48:32,479 --> 08:48:34,479
If I just go like...

4088
08:48:34,479 --> 08:48:40,819
It just snaps to the wire.

4089
08:48:40,819 --> 08:48:50,029
My balance is shit though.

4090
08:48:50,029 --> 08:48:53,360
I need to get my rail up.

4091
08:48:53,360 --> 08:48:55,360
Is there like a free skate

4092
08:48:55,360 --> 08:48:58,299
where I can just get...

4093
08:48:58,299 --> 08:49:05,409
My balance is really not great.

4094
08:49:05,409 --> 08:49:11,490
Let me try this like one or two more times.

4095
08:49:11,490 --> 08:49:16,799
I'm gonna use it.

4096
08:49:16,799 --> 08:49:18,799
I turned it off.

4097
08:49:18,799 --> 08:49:24,240
Ultra concentration.

4098
08:49:24,240 --> 08:49:26,240
Alright, same theory.

4099
08:49:26,240 --> 08:49:29,119
So just...

4100
08:49:29,119 --> 08:49:32,639
Here it is.

4101
08:49:32,639 --> 08:49:38,770
I'm still up here.

4102
08:49:38,770 --> 08:49:44,020
Now what?

4103
08:49:44,020 --> 08:49:53,659
He goes down.

4104
08:49:53,659 --> 08:49:55,659
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

4105
08:49:55,659 --> 08:50:10,060
Where's he? Back?

4106
08:50:10,060 --> 08:50:35,220
It's alright! It's alright!

4107
08:50:35,220 --> 08:50:37,220
It's alright! It's alright!

4108
08:50:37,220 --> 08:50:56,139
I didn't know it was gonna rip that way.

4109
08:50:56,139 --> 08:51:01,970
What are you talking about? What?

4110
08:51:01,970 --> 08:51:07,279
How does he do that?

4111
08:51:07,279 --> 08:51:09,279
I think I can do... How does he get up there?

4112
08:51:09,279 --> 08:51:11,279
Hold on, can I stay here?

4113
08:51:11,279 --> 08:51:16,209
Holy shit, man.

4114
08:51:16,209 --> 08:51:18,700
You gotta be serious.

4115
08:51:18,700 --> 08:51:29,840
Alright, let's try this again.

4116
08:51:29,840 --> 08:51:34,060
I was kinda close.

4117
08:51:34,060 --> 08:51:41,680
I think that's better than I've ever done.

4118
08:51:41,680 --> 08:51:52,560
That might've been the only one to find out.

4119
08:51:52,560 --> 08:51:55,310
Get this down.

4120
08:51:55,310 --> 08:51:57,810
I jumped over it.

4121
08:51:57,810 --> 08:51:59,810
I'm delayed by like 4 tenths of a second right now.

4122
08:51:59,810 --> 08:52:12,349
Every time that hits me.

4123
08:52:12,349 --> 08:52:16,189
Let your older brother do it.

4124
08:52:16,189 --> 08:52:18,560
Imagine this older brother scenario here.

4125
08:52:18,560 --> 08:52:20,560
Imagine this older brother scenario here.

4126
08:52:20,560 --> 08:52:23,700
This would suck total asshole.

4127
08:52:23,700 --> 08:52:25,700
Being the older brother in this scenario.

4128
08:52:25,700 --> 08:52:27,700
This isn't just like jump over Bowser.

4129
08:52:27,700 --> 08:52:29,700
Little older brother.

4130
08:52:29,700 --> 08:52:31,700
Can you just jump over Bowser and grab the axe?

4131
08:52:31,700 --> 08:52:33,700
Yeah, of course I can, little brother!

4132
08:52:33,700 --> 08:52:35,700
Look at me! I can do it!

4133
08:52:35,700 --> 08:52:37,700
I'm so good at video games.

4134
08:52:37,700 --> 08:52:39,700
Can you beat this for me, older brother?

4135
08:52:39,700 --> 08:52:41,869
Yeah!

4136
08:52:41,869 --> 08:52:43,869
Need me to get another axe?

4137
08:52:43,869 --> 08:52:45,869
From, uh, dear old Bowser there?

4138
08:52:45,869 --> 08:52:47,869
Nope, this!

4139
08:52:47,869 --> 08:52:52,020
Oh!

4140
08:52:52,020 --> 08:52:58,419
Let me see it!

4141
08:52:58,419 --> 08:53:01,680
This is the ultimate older brother scenario.

4142
08:53:01,680 --> 08:53:04,369
I would try it.

4143
08:53:04,369 --> 08:53:11,900
Here we are.

4144
08:53:11,900 --> 08:53:23,169
That's another wired knife.

4145
08:53:23,169 --> 08:53:25,409
I'm calling it at 9 hours.

4146
08:53:25,409 --> 08:53:28,799
I'm calling it at 9 hours.

4147
08:53:28,799 --> 08:53:30,799
Actually have to call it.

4148
08:53:30,799 --> 08:53:35,220
I have to call it at 9 hours.

4149
08:53:35,220 --> 08:53:37,220
I'll stream it tomorrow too.

4150
08:53:37,220 --> 08:53:39,220
Day 5 in a row coming up here.

4151
08:53:39,220 --> 08:53:41,220
And I don't want...

4152
08:53:41,220 --> 08:53:43,220
I don't want to stream like 60 hours this week.

4153
08:53:43,220 --> 08:53:45,220
I don't want to stream like 60 hours this week.

4154
08:53:45,220 --> 08:53:47,220
We're like crossing like

4155
08:53:47,220 --> 08:53:49,220
50 something hours

4156
08:53:49,220 --> 08:53:58,819
as of tomorrow.

4157
08:53:58,819 --> 08:54:00,819
I really didn't plan on having like

4158
08:54:00,819 --> 08:54:02,819
4, 50 plus hour like

4159
08:54:02,819 --> 08:54:08,060
I had it but I lost it.

4160
08:54:08,060 --> 08:54:24,830
People are working more than

4161
08:54:24,830 --> 08:54:28,669
60 hours a week?

4162
08:54:28,669 --> 08:54:32,130
That's a lot of time.

4163
08:54:32,130 --> 08:54:34,130
That's 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.

4164
08:54:34,130 --> 08:54:36,130
Holy shit.

4165
08:54:36,130 --> 08:54:41,439
70 hours a week?

4166
08:54:41,439 --> 08:54:48,029
70?

4167
08:54:48,029 --> 08:54:59,299
I was always at like 38.

4168
08:54:59,299 --> 08:55:01,860
Like 35 to like

4169
08:55:01,860 --> 08:55:03,860
40.

4170
08:55:03,860 --> 08:55:05,860
7 fucking hours, holy shit.

4171
08:55:05,860 --> 08:55:07,860
That's a lot of time.

4172
08:55:07,860 --> 08:55:22,450
I overshot it.

4173
08:55:22,450 --> 08:55:27,569
Alright, 8, 56.

4174
08:55:27,569 --> 08:55:31,599
That's 8 days a week.

4175
08:55:31,599 --> 08:55:33,599
It depends on how many hours you work.

4176
08:55:33,599 --> 08:55:35,599
You work like 20 straight hours.

4177
08:55:35,599 --> 08:55:37,599
Like 12 straight hours.

4178
08:55:37,599 --> 08:55:40,740
That's a lot of time.

4179
08:55:40,740 --> 08:55:44,639
Yeah, I got that

4180
08:55:44,639 --> 08:55:46,639
9 hour a week schedule.

4181
08:55:46,639 --> 08:55:59,380
I can't even see the wires.

4182
08:55:59,380 --> 08:56:06,740
I don't even know which one I'm jumping to.

4183
08:56:06,740 --> 08:56:17,419
Just hold Y?

4184
08:56:17,419 --> 08:56:29,459
Yeah, I was.

4185
08:56:29,459 --> 08:56:31,459
I'm really just trying to follow him.

4186
08:56:31,459 --> 08:56:33,459
That's distracting in its own way.

4187
08:56:33,459 --> 08:56:53,419
How am I not going

4188
08:56:53,419 --> 08:56:56,180
far enough?

4189
08:56:56,180 --> 08:57:17,680
I'm waiting for the...

4190
08:57:17,680 --> 08:57:19,680
I don't think it's a complete disaster yet.

4191
08:57:19,680 --> 08:57:32,799
Fucking rail sucks.

4192
08:57:32,799 --> 08:57:38,819
I have 2 minutes to do this.

4193
08:57:38,819 --> 08:58:19,459
How was I not turned all the way?

4194
08:58:19,459 --> 08:58:21,459
What the fuck, man?

4195
08:58:21,459 --> 08:58:31,819
Having like 60%

4196
08:58:31,819 --> 08:58:33,819
rail is actually fucking ruining this whole thing.

4197
08:58:33,819 --> 08:58:36,189
Not having the rail

4198
08:58:36,189 --> 08:58:38,189
at 100% is actually

4199
08:58:38,189 --> 08:58:40,189
ruining these runs.

4200
08:58:40,189 --> 08:58:43,069
Without a doubt. I don't even know where he is.

4201
08:58:43,069 --> 08:58:52,610
I need to level up like 5

4202
08:58:52,610 --> 08:58:54,979
more times.

4203
08:58:54,979 --> 08:58:56,979
To be able to reliably probably do this.

4204
08:58:56,979 --> 08:59:02,669
I'm up in front of you.

4205
08:59:02,669 --> 08:59:04,669
Dude, why am I even...

4206
08:59:04,669 --> 08:59:14,139
This is where I got to last time.

4207
08:59:14,139 --> 08:59:16,139
He goes up and then he rides the...

4208
08:59:16,139 --> 08:59:25,490
No!

4209
08:59:25,490 --> 08:59:27,490
That's the farthest I've gone.

4210
08:59:27,490 --> 08:59:30,110
It was right there. I was so close.

4211
08:59:30,110 --> 08:59:32,110
I just didn't know what was next.

4212
08:59:32,110 --> 08:59:34,740
Do it in one combo. Do it in one combo!

4213
08:59:34,740 --> 08:59:40,939
That's the first time I've ever even seen that one.

4214
08:59:40,939 --> 08:59:52,979
Should have just done the flush.

4215
08:59:52,979 --> 08:59:55,860
I feel like I can do it now.

4216
08:59:55,860 --> 08:59:58,290
Let's see. I'm supposed to stop

4217
08:59:58,290 --> 09:00:00,659
right now.

4218
09:00:00,659 --> 09:00:04,240
Why even give him fucking firebombs?

4219
09:00:04,240 --> 09:00:06,240
This shit already sucks.

4220
09:00:06,240 --> 09:00:08,240
Why?

4221
09:00:08,240 --> 09:00:24,349
Oh, boss.

4222
09:00:24,349 --> 09:00:27,299
That Eric Wynn.

4223
09:00:27,299 --> 09:00:29,299
Why can't I just push him off the fucking balcony?

4224
09:00:31,299 --> 09:00:44,779
Why?

4225
09:00:44,779 --> 09:00:46,779
Is it there? I tried to wait to

4226
09:00:46,779 --> 09:01:07,389
jump on the other side of the bridge.

4227
09:01:07,389 --> 09:01:09,700
I feel like

4228
09:01:09,700 --> 09:01:11,700
transferring there is

4229
09:01:11,700 --> 09:01:13,700
probably not a great idea.

4230
09:01:22,240 --> 09:01:31,119
Slow it down.

4231
09:01:31,119 --> 09:01:33,119
What are you up to?

4232
09:01:33,119 --> 09:01:35,119
What are you up to?

4233
09:01:35,119 --> 09:01:49,200
What are you two boys

4234
09:01:49,200 --> 09:01:51,200
up to?

4235
09:01:51,200 --> 09:01:53,200
That's Adam Sandler doing his grandmother.

4236
09:01:53,200 --> 09:02:16,479
Alright, I got plenty of time.

4237
09:02:16,479 --> 09:02:19,169
Oh, you motherfucker. Are you kidding me?

4238
09:02:40,080 --> 09:02:44,110
This sucks.

4239
09:02:44,110 --> 09:02:49,810
Why?

4240
09:02:49,810 --> 09:02:51,810
This sucks,

4241
09:02:51,810 --> 09:02:54,430
asshole.

4242
09:02:54,430 --> 09:02:58,849
This sucks.

4243
09:02:58,849 --> 09:03:04,860
Jump higher.

4244
09:03:04,860 --> 09:03:13,630
That's a good idea.

4245
09:03:13,630 --> 09:03:15,630
This is where it gets all fucked up.

4246
09:03:15,630 --> 09:03:18,509
Speaking of fucking up.

4247
09:03:18,509 --> 09:03:21,580
How are you going to sleep tonight

4248
09:03:21,580 --> 09:03:24,209
knowing Eric schooled you?

4249
09:03:24,209 --> 09:03:26,209
I'm not going to. I'm not done.

4250
09:03:26,209 --> 09:03:31,779
I'm at like 38

4251
09:03:31,779 --> 09:03:33,779
out of 41. I was going to throw in

4252
09:03:33,779 --> 09:03:37,549
the towel, but

4253
09:03:37,549 --> 09:03:39,549
I didn't think I was going to get past

4254
09:03:39,549 --> 09:03:43,009
16. So I can't throw

4255
09:03:43,009 --> 09:03:45,009
the towel in now because I saw the end of

4256
09:03:45,009 --> 09:03:48,020
the game. Quick, gas

4257
09:03:48,020 --> 09:03:50,450
light it. You don't need to gas

4258
09:03:50,450 --> 09:03:52,450
light me. I'm already

4259
09:03:52,450 --> 09:04:02,430
burning. This fire is hot.

4260
09:04:02,430 --> 09:04:19,139
Why can I not do this?

4261
09:04:19,139 --> 09:04:21,310
It's one of the things I can't fucking do.

4262
09:04:21,310 --> 09:04:23,310
It's that stupid thing.

4263
09:04:23,310 --> 09:04:25,740
It's like one of the only things

4264
09:04:25,740 --> 09:04:27,740
I can't do now. Oh my god.

4265
09:04:27,740 --> 09:04:35,659
Go back.

4266
09:04:35,659 --> 09:04:39,700
Go back. Alright, here we go.

4267
09:04:39,700 --> 09:04:41,700
Playground bullshit.

4268
09:04:41,700 --> 09:04:54,939
I was on the fucking power cord

4269
09:04:54,939 --> 09:05:01,090
for too long. Just get off. I have a new strategy.

4270
09:05:01,090 --> 09:05:04,930
I don't give a shit. Just grab him.

4271
09:05:18,740 --> 09:05:20,740
You stabbed me in the back.

4272
09:05:20,740 --> 09:05:22,740
Why did you stab me in the fucking

4273
09:05:22,740 --> 09:05:37,200
back? Dumb thing

4274
09:05:37,200 --> 09:05:41,490
to do. You keep getting to that

4275
09:05:41,490 --> 09:05:43,490
stupid part. And yes, I'm

4276
09:05:43,490 --> 09:05:45,490
just going to jump. I'm going to get off the fucking

4277
09:05:45,490 --> 09:05:47,490
thing. And I'm just going to grab him because

4278
09:05:47,490 --> 09:05:49,490
I can't. I can't

4279
09:05:49,490 --> 09:05:51,490
do it. I can do it while walking.

4280
09:05:51,490 --> 09:05:54,560
Or I'm just going to say fuck it

4281
09:05:54,560 --> 09:05:56,560
and just practice it.

4282
09:05:56,560 --> 09:05:59,180
I've gotten so far. Like what the

4283
09:05:59,180 --> 09:06:01,180
hell, Eric?

4284
09:06:01,180 --> 09:06:04,130
How did he drop you in the ocean?

4285
09:06:04,130 --> 09:06:09,949
Hey, just stop

4286
09:06:09,949 --> 09:06:11,949
sucking.

4287
09:06:11,949 --> 09:06:17,500
Yeah.

4288
09:06:17,500 --> 09:06:19,500
Maybe we should do that too.

4289
09:06:19,500 --> 09:06:25,580
What other phrases can I get out of you?

4290
09:06:25,580 --> 09:06:30,750
This streamer sucks.

4291
09:06:30,750 --> 09:06:36,180
Stop

4292
09:06:36,180 --> 09:06:47,120
pretending.

4293
09:06:47,120 --> 09:06:49,620
Stop stalling, idiot.

4294
09:06:49,620 --> 09:07:01,900
Twitch chat

4295
09:07:01,900 --> 09:07:04,339
comes with four phrases

4296
09:07:04,339 --> 09:07:06,339
and has a karate chop action.

4297
09:07:23,360 --> 09:07:30,080
Alright, I have

4298
09:07:30,080 --> 09:07:32,080
I don't do it now, I'm off.

4299
09:07:32,080 --> 09:07:34,080
I'm more of a molding

4300
09:07:34,080 --> 09:07:36,080
meltdown PlayStation

4301
09:07:36,080 --> 09:07:38,080
fucking 2 stream.

4302
09:07:38,080 --> 09:07:50,800
Who cares?

4303
09:07:50,800 --> 09:08:02,379
Alright, here we go. What is it? It's Xbox.

4304
09:08:02,379 --> 09:08:04,879
How dare you

4305
09:08:04,879 --> 09:08:06,879
correct me? Did you just

4306
09:08:06,879 --> 09:08:10,019
correct the streamer?

4307
09:08:10,019 --> 09:08:12,019
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4308
09:08:12,019 --> 09:08:14,900
That's corrected?

4309
09:08:14,900 --> 09:08:18,860
Okay.

4310
09:08:18,860 --> 09:08:24,610
How did I miss that?

4311
09:08:24,610 --> 09:08:26,610
I held Y the whole time?

4312
09:08:26,610 --> 09:08:30,449
I held Y and I waited so long.

4313
09:08:30,449 --> 09:08:34,739
His ego.

4314
09:08:34,739 --> 09:08:36,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4315
09:08:36,739 --> 09:08:38,739
You're saying it's on the Xbox

4316
09:08:38,739 --> 09:08:40,739
and make me look bad

4317
09:08:40,739 --> 09:08:42,739
in front of fucking like 400

4318
09:08:42,739 --> 09:08:44,980
people?

4319
09:08:44,980 --> 09:08:47,410
I can't.

4320
09:08:47,410 --> 09:08:49,410
I don't get it, I don't understand.

4321
09:08:49,410 --> 09:08:52,540
What the fuck did you...

4322
09:08:52,540 --> 09:09:02,589
I'm holding Y when I jump

4323
09:09:02,589 --> 09:09:06,819
too. It seems so

4324
09:09:06,819 --> 09:09:09,819
finicky.

4325
09:09:09,819 --> 09:09:11,819
Tap Y?

4326
09:09:11,819 --> 09:09:13,819
I mean, that's what I

4327
09:09:13,819 --> 09:09:15,819
was tapping Y before and I got a bunch of

4328
09:09:15,819 --> 09:09:17,819
people telling me that I should hold Y.

4329
09:09:17,819 --> 09:09:40,080
Which one is it? I was falling off.

4330
09:09:40,080 --> 09:09:42,510
I'm like, that's almost like

4331
09:09:42,510 --> 09:09:44,510
I'm not getting enough air.

4332
09:09:44,510 --> 09:09:47,580
What is my air even at?

4333
09:09:47,580 --> 09:09:49,580
Doesn't it feel like I'm not getting enough air?

4334
09:09:49,580 --> 09:09:52,139
Apparently, I don't know.

4335
09:09:52,139 --> 09:10:02,830
Breathe.

4336
09:10:02,830 --> 09:10:27,919
I thought I was too late

4337
09:10:27,919 --> 09:10:30,989
before, now I'm too early.

4338
09:10:30,989 --> 09:10:32,989
That's the worst jump of the whole entire run.

4339
09:10:32,989 --> 09:10:34,989
The other ones I could probably get if I did them enough times.

4340
09:10:34,989 --> 09:10:43,819
It was definitely too early, yeah.

4341
09:10:43,819 --> 09:10:45,819
I figured maybe because the bridge goes

4342
09:10:45,819 --> 09:10:47,819
up before it goes down.

4343
09:10:47,819 --> 09:10:49,819
Maybe. Let's see.

4344
09:10:49,819 --> 09:10:54,940
Plus, I have to fucking worry

4345
09:10:54,940 --> 09:10:56,940
about the stupid triangle on the screen.

4346
09:10:59,500 --> 09:11:17,230
Like that. Meltdown?

4347
09:11:17,230 --> 09:11:19,230
No, I don't think so.

4348
09:11:19,230 --> 09:11:24,739
I don't think so.

4349
09:11:24,739 --> 09:11:29,470
I'm alright right now.

4350
09:11:29,470 --> 09:11:45,919
Fucking... I'm fine. Hey, you know

4351
09:11:45,919 --> 09:11:47,919
what does it say? You don't have to come over for career day

4352
09:11:47,919 --> 09:11:50,099
anymore? Wait, what, why?

4353
09:11:50,099 --> 09:11:53,360
Go to bed? I'm fine.

4354
09:11:53,360 --> 09:11:57,459
Don't worry.

4355
09:11:57,459 --> 09:11:59,459
This is the end, too. And I'm not playing

4356
09:11:59,459 --> 09:12:01,459
Xbox tomorrow.

4357
09:12:01,459 --> 09:12:03,949
We're doing Diablo 2 tomorrow.

4358
09:12:03,949 --> 09:12:06,639
So, it's a whole other

4359
09:12:06,639 --> 09:12:08,639
setup. So, it's either now or

4360
09:12:08,639 --> 09:12:23,169
it's probably never. I didn't even

4361
09:12:23,169 --> 09:12:25,169
mean to jump. I let go. My hands

4362
09:12:25,169 --> 09:12:27,169
are sweaty. I had my hand

4363
09:12:27,169 --> 09:12:43,230
let go of me. I didn't mean to jump.

4364
09:12:43,230 --> 09:12:45,230
Let's go. Let's go. This is it.

4365
09:12:45,230 --> 09:12:56,500
All night, boys and girls.

4366
09:12:56,500 --> 09:13:08,449
You're not. Something is

4367
09:13:08,449 --> 09:13:10,449
wrong. What am I doing wrong?

4368
09:13:10,449 --> 09:13:12,449
Is it still too early?

4369
09:13:12,449 --> 09:13:15,330
I can't even fucking tell,

4370
09:13:15,330 --> 09:13:18,849
man. How far

4371
09:13:18,849 --> 09:13:20,849
do I have to be on this stupid

4372
09:13:20,849 --> 09:13:30,059
thing? You're supposed to have max

4373
09:13:30,059 --> 09:13:36,529
stats. Am I really

4374
09:13:36,529 --> 09:13:38,529
just doing this for no reason because I don't have enough stats

4375
09:13:38,529 --> 09:13:43,330
to do it? I mean, I've gotten pretty

4376
09:13:43,330 --> 09:13:45,760
damn close. Yes.

4377
09:13:45,760 --> 09:13:49,279
No. Why

4378
09:13:49,279 --> 09:13:51,279
do I feel like people saying no want

4379
09:13:51,279 --> 09:13:53,279
this to be a 12 hour stream?

4380
09:13:53,279 --> 09:14:14,510
I've waited so long.

4381
09:14:14,510 --> 09:14:16,510
If I wait any longer, I'm going to fall

4382
09:14:16,510 --> 09:14:32,830
off the damn bridge. Losing too much

4383
09:14:32,830 --> 09:14:35,260
momentum. You need to jump

4384
09:14:35,260 --> 09:14:37,819
more.

4385
09:14:37,819 --> 09:14:39,819
That's what I was thinking. Just like jump.

4386
09:14:39,819 --> 09:14:41,819
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

4387
09:14:41,819 --> 09:14:44,959
He's going sideways.

4388
09:14:44,959 --> 09:14:52,900
The absolute worst

4389
09:14:52,900 --> 09:15:03,459
time. Plus, the guy going sideways.

4390
09:15:03,459 --> 09:15:05,459
That's what you guys have been

4391
09:15:05,459 --> 09:15:07,459
talking about. I was wondering what the fuck

4392
09:15:07,459 --> 09:15:09,459
you guys are talking about. Admin, he's

4393
09:15:09,459 --> 09:15:12,529
going sideways. That's

4394
09:15:12,529 --> 09:15:14,529
what you guys are on about. Okay.

4395
09:15:14,529 --> 09:15:30,000
I think I'm going crazy. How is

4396
09:15:30,000 --> 09:15:41,970
it possible? I feel like you're missing

4397
09:15:41,970 --> 09:15:47,919
Tony Hawk.

4398
09:15:47,919 --> 09:15:50,989
God damn it.

4399
09:15:50,989 --> 09:15:52,989
Why do you have to keep me

4400
09:15:52,989 --> 09:15:54,989
addicted here on this

4401
09:15:54,989 --> 09:15:56,989
fucking burn

4402
09:15:56,989 --> 09:15:58,989
into muscle memory?

4403
09:15:58,989 --> 09:16:00,989
This one stage.

4404
09:16:00,989 --> 09:16:09,699
I haven't even done a royal flush in a while

4405
09:16:09,699 --> 09:16:11,699
either. What a fucking mistake.

4406
09:16:41,169 --> 09:16:45,900
Now we're getting, alright. Now

4407
09:16:45,900 --> 09:16:49,300
we're getting, we're getting to this, yeah.

4408
09:16:49,300 --> 09:16:51,300
You know the stage of

4409
09:16:51,300 --> 09:16:53,300
video game madness?

4410
09:16:53,300 --> 09:16:55,300
When you do

4411
09:16:55,300 --> 09:16:57,300
the same thing so many times

4412
09:16:57,300 --> 09:16:59,300
that

4413
09:16:59,300 --> 09:17:01,300
it starts to become a dream.

4414
09:17:01,300 --> 09:17:03,300
I'm having a dream about this game

4415
09:17:03,300 --> 09:17:05,300
right now, this stage, right here.

4416
09:17:05,300 --> 09:17:14,379
Your skills are depleting.

4417
09:17:14,379 --> 09:17:21,599
Yes.

4418
09:17:21,599 --> 09:17:23,599
Alright, I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

4419
09:17:23,599 --> 09:17:25,599
That's it. I'm calling it. I've called it. Now I

4420
09:17:25,599 --> 09:17:27,599
have to do it. I have to call it. I've called it.

4421
09:17:27,599 --> 09:17:29,599
It's over. I've called it.

4422
09:17:29,599 --> 09:17:31,599
It's over. That's it. That's enough.

4423
09:17:31,599 --> 09:17:33,779
We'll be live tomorrow with Diablo 2.

4424
09:17:33,779 --> 09:17:36,400
I've called it.

4425
09:17:36,400 --> 09:17:38,400
I've called it.

4426
09:17:38,400 --> 09:17:40,400
I can't sit here and do this anymore.

4427
09:17:40,400 --> 09:17:42,400
This burning hole in my brain.

4428
09:17:42,400 --> 09:17:46,480
I can't.

4429
09:17:46,480 --> 09:17:48,480
I'm gonna go to the, oh here comes another

4430
09:17:48,480 --> 09:17:50,480
doctor bit. Oh, Derby, you go to the doctor

4431
09:17:50,480 --> 09:17:52,480
when something happens in a video game and you get

4432
09:17:52,480 --> 09:17:54,480
like mad? Yeah, you come to me every time.

4433
09:17:54,480 --> 09:17:56,480
I know. Let me go, let me see if I can figure

4434
09:17:56,480 --> 09:17:58,480
out what you're gonna say. Hmm.

4435
09:17:58,480 --> 09:18:00,480
You're going to say, uh,

4436
09:18:00,480 --> 09:18:02,480
hey doc, something's wrong. And the doctor's

4437
09:18:02,480 --> 09:18:04,480
gonna say, oh, did you play Tony Hawk 2?

4438
09:18:04,480 --> 09:18:07,940
Yes.

4439
09:18:07,940 --> 09:18:09,940
That was what I was about to do.

4440
09:18:09,940 --> 09:18:16,699
The time loop.

4441
09:18:16,699 --> 09:18:19,519
I don't want to do this anymore.

4442
09:18:19,519 --> 09:18:21,519
If I don't actually get into the next

4443
09:18:21,519 --> 09:18:23,519
like three attempts,

4444
09:18:23,519 --> 09:18:26,529
I'm out. Maybe I'll try it again tomorrow.

4445
09:18:26,529 --> 09:18:46,610
Clip that. Somebody clip it.

4446
09:18:46,610 --> 09:18:48,610
And slow it down. For the frame.

4447
09:18:48,610 --> 09:18:59,790
It's my stats.

4448
09:18:59,790 --> 09:19:01,790
I want a frame by

4449
09:19:01,790 --> 09:19:03,790
frame analysis. I want to hire

4450
09:19:03,790 --> 09:19:05,790
like an e-sports pro to do a frame

4451
09:19:05,790 --> 09:19:07,790
by frame analysis is why I didn't jump

4452
09:19:07,790 --> 09:19:09,790
higher at the end of that.

4453
09:19:09,790 --> 09:19:12,349
Don't grind on the ledge. What do you want me to

4454
09:19:12,349 --> 09:19:14,349
jump? You don't want to, wait,

4455
09:19:14,349 --> 09:19:24,529
walk it? I was lucky.

4456
09:19:24,529 --> 09:19:26,529
I didn't even mean to get that. Do you see

4457
09:19:26,529 --> 09:19:28,529
how fucking horrible that was? I did

4458
09:19:28,529 --> 09:19:30,529
not even get that. I don't have enough

4459
09:19:30,529 --> 09:19:37,120
stats. Somebody, I want an e-sports

4460
09:19:37,120 --> 09:19:39,120
pro to clip that one and

4461
09:19:39,120 --> 09:19:41,120
tell me what happened with that.

4462
09:19:41,120 --> 09:20:12,529
Sorry, I fell into it.

4463
09:20:12,529 --> 09:20:17,260
I fell into it. Sorry, did you get speed?

4464
09:20:17,260 --> 09:20:28,980
Why did I go into a manual?

4465
09:20:28,980 --> 09:20:30,980
The Xbox controller with the one

4466
09:20:30,980 --> 09:20:32,980
big fucking button. One big

4467
09:20:32,980 --> 09:20:51,279
ass button.

4468
09:20:51,279 --> 09:20:56,779
Get it! Get up, it's okay. Your

4469
09:20:56,779 --> 09:20:58,779
knee's gonna be fine, honey. Your

4470
09:20:58,779 --> 09:21:00,779
knee's gonna be fine, honey!

4471
09:21:00,779 --> 09:21:07,059
Slam city jammer.

4472
09:21:07,059 --> 09:21:09,059
You lucky little bitch. Get back here.

4473
09:21:09,059 --> 09:21:12,379
You ain't nothing to me.

4474
09:21:12,379 --> 09:21:14,379
I can't. I can't

4475
09:21:14,379 --> 09:21:16,379
anymore. I can't. That was fucking

4476
09:21:16,379 --> 09:21:18,379
terrible. That was

4477
09:21:18,379 --> 09:21:21,440
that was terrible.

4478
09:21:21,440 --> 09:21:23,620
That was unbelievably awful.

4479
09:21:42,419 --> 09:21:44,419
That was so bad. I don't even feel

4480
09:21:44,419 --> 09:21:52,290
fulfilled. Praise

4481
09:21:52,290 --> 09:21:57,980
water. Dude,

4482
09:21:57,980 --> 09:21:59,980
I almost turned the camera on.

4483
09:21:59,980 --> 09:22:02,800
I almost turned the camera

4484
09:22:02,800 --> 09:22:04,800
on and did a wink right at the end.

4485
09:22:04,800 --> 09:22:06,980
Because I was like, fuck it, it's over and I'm just gonna get

4486
09:22:06,980 --> 09:22:11,970
a wink out. Oh my god,

4487
09:22:11,970 --> 09:22:13,970
that was so painful. I wasn't even that big

4488
09:22:13,970 --> 09:22:15,970
of a deal either. I'm so sorry, everybody.

4489
09:22:18,529 --> 09:22:20,529
That was probably so painful.

4490
09:22:25,860 --> 09:22:28,930
But yeah, look at that!

4491
09:22:39,790 --> 09:22:46,129
That game was great. What a fun game.

4492
09:22:50,129 --> 09:22:52,129
Oh, that was a really fun game.

4493
09:22:52,129 --> 09:22:54,129
Just as good as I remember.

4494
09:22:59,379 --> 09:23:01,379
We got a ton of subs, too.

4495
09:23:01,379 --> 09:23:03,379
Boiki gave 20 community subs.

4496
09:23:11,199 --> 09:23:13,500
Okay, so somebody gave...

4497
09:23:15,500 --> 09:23:17,500
Secret level.

4498
09:23:17,500 --> 09:23:21,730
We got Iron Man?

4499
09:23:21,730 --> 09:23:24,610
Marvel Iron Man

4500
09:23:24,610 --> 09:23:26,610
Iron Man and Marvel characters

4501
09:23:26,610 --> 09:23:29,620
are... I'm not going to bed.

4502
09:23:29,620 --> 09:23:32,160
Not yet. I'm not going to bed

4503
09:23:32,160 --> 09:23:34,160
yet. I want to see Iron Man. I want to do a secret level

4504
09:23:34,160 --> 09:23:36,980
with Iron Man. And Gene

4505
09:23:36,980 --> 09:23:49,839
Simmons. God damn you,

4506
09:23:49,839 --> 09:23:51,839
Tony Hawk.

4507
09:23:51,839 --> 09:23:53,839
I want to address these bits here.

4508
09:23:53,839 --> 09:23:55,839
SoupGG gave a thousand bits,

4509
09:23:55,839 --> 09:23:57,839
but first of all, they said cheesesteak guy here. Okay,

4510
09:23:57,839 --> 09:23:59,839
so cheesesteak guy, the guy that said he would beat

4511
09:23:59,839 --> 09:24:01,839
Big Apple's challenge before 10.

4512
09:24:01,839 --> 09:24:03,839
So I'll throw up my cheesesteak on my keyboard. I didn't,

4513
09:24:03,839 --> 09:24:05,839
by the way.

4514
09:24:05,839 --> 09:24:07,839
I just want to say you're the worst Tony Hawk player

4515
09:24:07,839 --> 09:24:09,839
I've ever seen.

4516
09:24:09,839 --> 09:24:11,839
It's not even true. You give this controller to a baby

4517
09:24:11,839 --> 09:24:13,839
and they won't be able to get past level one, I guarantee you.

4518
09:24:13,839 --> 09:24:15,839
That being said, this is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.

4519
09:24:15,839 --> 09:24:17,839
Thank you, Jeremy. Love you. Thanks for playing my favorite game

4520
09:24:17,839 --> 09:24:19,839
ever.

4521
09:24:19,839 --> 09:24:26,099
Let's try that again.

4522
09:24:26,099 --> 09:24:28,099
SoupGG says...

4523
09:24:28,099 --> 09:24:30,099
SoupGG says, hey, cheesesteak

4524
09:24:30,099 --> 09:24:32,099
guy here.

4525
09:24:32,099 --> 09:24:34,099
If you don't know,

4526
09:24:34,099 --> 09:24:36,099
somebody told me

4527
09:24:36,099 --> 09:24:38,099
SoupGG said that

4528
09:24:38,099 --> 09:24:40,099
I can't even do it again.

4529
09:24:40,099 --> 09:24:42,910
SoupGG said that if

4530
09:24:42,910 --> 09:24:44,910
I beat Tony Hawk Pro Skater

4531
09:24:44,910 --> 09:24:46,910
Underground,

4532
09:24:46,910 --> 09:24:48,910
Big Apple spot challenge in

4533
09:24:48,910 --> 09:24:50,910
four attempts, he would throw up a cheesesteak on his keyboard.

4534
09:24:50,910 --> 09:24:52,910
I didn't, by the way,

4535
09:24:52,910 --> 09:24:54,910
if you're just joining us. That didn't happen.

4536
09:24:54,910 --> 09:24:56,910
That being said,

4537
09:24:56,910 --> 09:24:58,910
you're probably the worst Tony Hawk player

4538
09:24:58,910 --> 09:25:00,910
I've ever seen. I said that's not true.

4539
09:25:00,910 --> 09:25:02,910
This is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.

4540
09:25:02,910 --> 09:25:04,910
Thank you for playing my favorite game ever.

4541
09:25:04,910 --> 09:25:09,139
I'm not the worst Tony Hawk player

4542
09:25:09,139 --> 09:25:11,139
you've ever seen. If I was the worst Tony Hawk player

4543
09:25:11,139 --> 09:25:13,139
you've ever seen, I wouldn't have beaten

4544
09:25:13,139 --> 09:25:15,139
the game. I would have...

4545
09:25:15,139 --> 09:25:17,500
Guys, worst Tony Hawk player ever

4546
09:25:17,500 --> 09:25:19,500
means you can't even do a manual.

4547
09:25:19,500 --> 09:25:22,059
You don't even know what it is.

4548
09:25:22,059 --> 09:25:24,059
Like, you don't even know what a combo is. You just do a kickflip

4549
09:25:24,059 --> 09:25:26,059
over a ledge.

4550
09:25:26,059 --> 09:25:28,690
You don't even know...

4551
09:25:28,690 --> 09:25:30,690
I think that you cannot be claimed as one of the

4552
09:25:30,690 --> 09:25:32,690
worst Tony Hawk players ever,

4553
09:25:32,690 --> 09:25:34,690
if you get a hundred thousand points

4554
09:25:34,690 --> 09:25:36,690
on a combo. You just not.

4555
09:25:36,690 --> 09:25:38,690
That's impossible.

4556
09:25:38,690 --> 09:25:40,690
People just do a kickflip and get a hundred points

4557
09:25:40,690 --> 09:25:47,860
and they're done. You're the worst

4558
09:25:47,860 --> 09:25:49,860
player to have beaten the game.

4559
09:25:49,860 --> 09:25:51,860
That's like so not even true.

4560
09:25:51,860 --> 09:25:56,339
Even worst Tony Hawk player would beat

4561
09:25:56,339 --> 09:25:58,339
Eric first try. That's not even true.

4562
09:25:58,339 --> 09:26:00,900
That's not even true. That guy's gonna whip.

4563
09:26:00,900 --> 09:26:04,419
Alright. That's dangerous, mate.

4564
09:26:04,419 --> 09:26:06,419
That's not how you use a whip.

4565
09:26:06,419 --> 09:26:09,300
You crack a whip. You don't

4566
09:26:09,300 --> 09:26:11,599
swing a whip.

4567
09:26:11,599 --> 09:26:16,019
It's just in the Neversoft office.

4568
09:26:16,019 --> 09:26:18,019
These guys are doing this wrong. Someone's gonna get hurt.

4569
09:26:18,019 --> 09:26:29,860
Funny story.

4570
09:26:29,860 --> 09:26:31,860
For the Carnival stream,

4571
09:26:31,860 --> 09:26:34,739
instead of Polypolite and

4572
09:26:34,739 --> 09:26:36,739
Cuddles,

4573
09:26:36,739 --> 09:26:39,300
we were in talks

4574
09:26:39,300 --> 09:26:41,300
to have a different

4575
09:26:41,300 --> 09:26:43,300
clown on that stream.

4576
09:26:43,300 --> 09:26:45,300
And that clown was a

4577
09:26:45,300 --> 09:26:47,300
kind of one of those...

4578
09:26:47,300 --> 09:26:49,300
He said it was kind of like a freak show clown.

4579
09:26:49,300 --> 09:26:51,300
He was going to bring

4580
09:26:51,300 --> 09:26:53,300
a whip and I

4581
09:26:53,300 --> 09:26:55,300
was gonna put a cigarette in my mouth and he was going to

4582
09:26:55,300 --> 09:26:57,300
whip a cigarette out of my mouth.

4583
09:26:57,300 --> 09:26:59,300
And we were seconds

4584
09:26:59,300 --> 09:27:01,300
away from signing this guy.

4585
09:27:01,300 --> 09:27:03,300
But the reason why we didn't is in the 0.01%

4586
09:27:03,300 --> 09:27:05,300
chance that he like

4587
09:27:05,300 --> 09:27:07,300
blows up my face.

4588
09:27:07,300 --> 09:27:10,110
So we were like, no,

4589
09:27:10,110 --> 09:27:12,110
we can't. That's not a good

4590
09:27:12,110 --> 09:27:25,099
idea. That's a

4591
09:27:25,099 --> 09:27:27,540
family guy joke. I mean,

4592
09:27:27,540 --> 09:27:29,540
it's a sideshow act.

4593
09:27:29,540 --> 09:27:32,029
So he was gonna like,

4594
09:27:32,029 --> 09:27:34,029
hey, I'm gonna whip the thing out of your mouth.

4595
09:27:34,029 --> 09:27:36,029
Because he's very accurate and

4596
09:27:36,029 --> 09:27:41,410
that would have been legendary.

4597
09:27:41,410 --> 09:27:43,410
But I can't. No. We talked about it

4598
09:27:43,410 --> 09:27:45,410
extensively. The guy was a really nice guy too.

4599
09:27:45,410 --> 09:27:47,410
He's really like

4600
09:27:47,410 --> 09:27:49,410
interesting, really fun, smart person.

4601
09:27:49,410 --> 09:28:00,419
Imagine if your childhood

4602
09:28:00,419 --> 09:28:02,419
friends stole your jokes and got more Twitch

4603
09:28:02,419 --> 09:28:04,419
subscribers than you. Would you

4604
09:28:04,419 --> 09:28:06,419
let him win or would you beat him in a clown off?

4605
09:28:06,419 --> 09:28:11,220
That was a bit message.

4606
09:28:11,220 --> 09:28:14,290
I had to read it. Alright, that's somebody's

4607
09:28:14,290 --> 09:28:25,360
fucking tooth. Where's Iron Man?

4608
09:28:40,349 --> 09:28:42,349
Oh my god.

4609
09:28:42,349 --> 09:28:44,349
Are you serious?

4610
09:28:44,349 --> 09:28:46,349
Edit tricks.

4611
09:28:46,349 --> 09:28:48,349
Special tricks.

4612
09:28:48,349 --> 09:28:50,349
The scanner. The boot

4613
09:28:50,349 --> 09:28:52,349
burst and fire blaster.

4614
09:28:52,349 --> 09:28:57,790
Let's go to

4615
09:28:57,790 --> 09:28:59,790
didn't we get a new level?

4616
09:28:59,790 --> 09:29:01,790
We got Venice, right?

4617
09:29:01,790 --> 09:29:05,309
Alright, here we go.

4618
09:29:05,309 --> 09:29:07,309
Iron Man.

4619
09:29:07,309 --> 09:29:10,769
Make Iron Man

4620
09:29:10,769 --> 09:29:20,180
flush. Oh, that was sand.

4621
09:29:36,459 --> 09:29:42,339
Here we go.

4622
09:30:07,790 --> 09:30:23,410
His head rocked back.

4623
09:30:28,449 --> 09:30:30,449
Okay, I need to, I have to leave.

4624
09:30:30,449 --> 09:30:32,449
I have to leave. I actually have to leave.

4625
09:30:32,449 --> 09:30:35,580
This is too much.

4626
09:30:38,910 --> 09:30:45,309
I just want to try.

4627
09:30:45,309 --> 09:30:47,870
Let's just go to Manhattan.

4628
09:30:47,870 --> 09:30:49,870
He's going insane. Hotter than hell?

4629
09:30:49,870 --> 09:30:53,010
Oh fuck, hold on.

4630
09:30:53,010 --> 09:30:55,010
I will watch the second ending, I promise.

4631
09:31:02,160 --> 09:31:04,160
The last time you're going to see it, we might as well get it out of

4632
09:31:04,160 --> 09:31:06,980
our system now.

4633
09:31:06,980 --> 09:31:08,980
Did it get knocked down? Who pushed me over?

4634
09:31:08,980 --> 09:31:14,290
Holy shit.

4635
09:31:14,290 --> 09:31:16,290
This lady means business.

4636
09:31:38,480 --> 09:31:42,260
That fucking Ryan

4637
09:31:42,260 --> 09:31:44,260
Mancliffe is going to haunt me for like the next six hours.

4638
09:31:44,260 --> 09:31:52,580
Hotter than hell.

4639
09:31:52,580 --> 09:31:59,279
Do his

4640
09:31:59,279 --> 09:32:02,099
special.

4641
09:32:02,099 --> 09:32:04,660
Big upper special.

4642
09:32:04,660 --> 09:32:06,660
Down right B, left right

4643
09:32:06,660 --> 09:32:08,660
Y.

4644
09:32:08,660 --> 09:32:12,879
We need to get special up.

4645
09:32:12,879 --> 09:32:17,099
Oh, this is the kiss level.

4646
09:32:17,099 --> 09:32:20,430
Why?

4647
09:32:20,430 --> 09:32:22,989
It seems interesting.

4648
09:32:22,989 --> 09:32:26,059
Turn the music on for this stage.

4649
09:32:26,059 --> 09:32:28,059
I mean, I kind of have to, right?

4650
09:32:30,059 --> 09:32:47,389
Let's go.

4651
09:32:47,389 --> 09:33:04,610
Let's do down right B.

4652
09:33:04,610 --> 09:33:23,410
Get the letters. Get the letters.

4653
09:33:23,410 --> 09:33:26,669
No, that's 59,000.

4654
09:33:26,669 --> 09:33:31,150
This is my favorite kiss song.

4655
09:33:31,150 --> 09:33:34,209
Give me that thing.

4656
09:33:34,209 --> 09:33:43,730
All right, that's it. Flush him.

4657
09:33:43,730 --> 09:33:46,160
Can I get a double flush to end it?

4658
09:33:46,160 --> 09:33:48,160
Get the letters. Get the letters.

4659
09:33:48,160 --> 09:33:50,160
Let me get the letters.

4660
09:33:50,160 --> 09:33:52,400
Okay.

4661
09:33:52,400 --> 09:33:55,860
I got it.

4662
09:33:55,860 --> 09:33:58,779
I got this S.

4663
09:33:58,779 --> 09:34:02,430
Get the letters.

4664
09:34:02,430 --> 09:34:04,430
Guys, I'm so demanding.

4665
09:34:04,430 --> 09:34:06,430
So commanding and demanding.

4666
09:34:06,430 --> 09:34:08,430
I'm gonna, I'm gonna

4667
09:34:08,430 --> 09:34:15,220
I don't know where the other letters even are.

4668
09:34:15,220 --> 09:34:21,419
All right, if I don't get 100,000 points

4669
09:34:21,419 --> 09:34:23,419
right now, I'm gonna get a 10

4670
09:34:23,419 --> 09:34:25,419
fucking, I'm gonna give 10

4671
09:34:25,419 --> 09:34:36,300
I'm gonna give 10

4672
09:34:36,300 --> 09:34:39,180
french fries to Kim.

4673
09:34:39,180 --> 09:34:45,199
Go to McDonald's next.

4674
09:34:45,199 --> 09:34:49,040
All right, it's K. Did I get it?

4675
09:34:49,040 --> 09:34:51,470
K. I got it.

4676
09:34:51,470 --> 09:34:56,080
Okay. K. S.

4677
09:34:56,080 --> 09:35:08,610
Where's the other one?

4678
09:35:08,610 --> 09:35:13,279
I'm blind. I got that.

4679
09:35:13,279 --> 09:35:15,279
Oh, I thought that was just a glass panel.

4680
09:35:15,279 --> 09:35:17,839
Look at the other panels underneath it.

4681
09:35:17,839 --> 09:35:20,910
Okay. K.

4682
09:35:20,910 --> 09:35:22,910
I. S. Where's the last S?

4683
09:35:22,910 --> 09:35:33,980
In the ring.

4684
09:35:33,980 --> 09:35:41,730
I'm gonna pierce my mind.

4685
09:35:41,730 --> 09:35:43,730
I'm gonna pierce my mind.

4686
09:35:43,730 --> 09:35:51,919
I'm gonna pierce

4687
09:35:51,919 --> 09:36:04,080
my mind.

4688
09:36:04,080 --> 09:36:07,860
Why can't I get up here?

4689
09:36:07,860 --> 09:36:09,860
I'm gonna pierce my mind.

4690
09:36:09,860 --> 09:36:11,860
I'm gonna pierce my mind.

4691
09:36:11,860 --> 09:36:25,489
Transfer. I mean, it looks like I

4692
09:36:25,489 --> 09:36:31,500
I just know people are gonna be very

4693
09:36:31,500 --> 09:36:33,500
upset about that. All right, transfer.

4694
09:36:33,500 --> 09:36:36,129
It's in a weird spot.

4695
09:36:36,129 --> 09:36:39,970
Can I just grab it?

4696
09:36:39,970 --> 09:36:45,919
I'm the damn thing.

4697
09:36:45,919 --> 09:36:47,919
R to transfer. Let's do it.

4698
09:36:47,919 --> 09:36:53,739
Just vert transfer. Yeah, I'm just doing

4699
09:36:53,739 --> 09:36:55,739
vert. Just trying to do vert transfer.

4700
09:36:55,739 --> 09:36:58,940
Just like the

4701
09:36:58,940 --> 09:37:01,120
The half pipe is behind the

4702
09:37:01,120 --> 09:37:03,120
The half pipe is behind the

4703
09:37:03,120 --> 09:37:07,139
I'm not pressing R.

4704
09:37:07,139 --> 09:37:17,760
The half pipe is behind it.

4705
09:37:17,760 --> 09:37:19,760
Can I just spine over this?

4706
09:37:19,760 --> 09:37:21,760
No, just spine over that.

4707
09:37:21,760 --> 09:37:24,319
Why would I try to do this?

4708
09:37:24,319 --> 09:37:26,319
All right, now I have to just jump through those.

4709
09:37:26,319 --> 09:37:33,660
What?

4710
09:37:33,660 --> 09:37:35,660
Oh, I can do it this way.

4711
09:37:35,660 --> 09:37:49,550
Wait.

4712
09:37:49,550 --> 09:37:51,919
Guys, you have to give me

4713
09:37:51,919 --> 09:37:53,919
a little bit of a break here.

4714
09:37:53,919 --> 09:37:55,919
It's been 10 hours of Tony Hawk.

4715
09:37:55,919 --> 09:37:57,919
And I've peed two times.

4716
09:37:57,919 --> 09:37:59,919
So, yeah.

4717
09:37:59,919 --> 09:38:01,919
It's not going as clean as it could be.

4718
09:38:01,919 --> 09:38:03,919
It's not going as clean as it could be.

4719
09:38:03,919 --> 09:38:13,069
Congratulations, you unlocked the kiss movie.

4720
09:38:13,069 --> 09:38:57,660
Do it again.

4721
09:38:57,660 --> 09:38:59,660
They put on a show for you.

4722
09:38:59,660 --> 09:39:05,099
You're gonna get banned from Twitch.

4723
09:39:05,099 --> 09:39:07,730
It's in the video game.

4724
09:39:07,730 --> 09:39:09,730
I'm not gonna get banned from Twitch for everything that's in the video game.

4725
09:39:09,730 --> 09:39:37,059
Get out of the way.

4726
09:39:37,059 --> 09:39:39,059
I have to get up here. Wait, that's me.

4727
09:39:39,059 --> 09:39:46,029
That scared the shit out of me.

4728
09:39:46,029 --> 09:39:48,029
I didn't even mean to do that. I just hit L.

4729
09:39:48,029 --> 09:40:02,480
Oh, no.

4730
09:40:02,480 --> 09:40:04,480
Here comes a

4731
09:40:04,480 --> 09:40:06,480
crazed kiss fan.

4732
09:40:06,480 --> 09:40:08,480
He wants to get on stage with Gene Simmons.

4733
09:40:08,480 --> 09:40:12,959
He just wants a selfie.

4734
09:40:12,959 --> 09:40:28,059
Why am I the only one

4735
09:40:28,059 --> 09:40:30,059
falling down?

4736
09:40:30,059 --> 09:40:34,099
Look, it's us. We did it.

4737
09:40:34,099 --> 09:40:45,489
Okay, it's funny.

4738
09:40:45,489 --> 09:40:47,489
Okay, time to go to bed.

4739
09:40:47,489 --> 09:41:12,860
That's it.

4740
09:41:12,860 --> 09:41:14,860
Alternate ending. Okay, we'll do

4741
09:41:14,860 --> 09:41:16,860
alternate ending right now.

4742
09:41:16,860 --> 09:41:19,099
Oh, my God.

4743
09:41:19,099 --> 09:41:21,099
Alternate. That was Tony Hawk Underground.

4744
09:41:21,099 --> 09:41:23,099
And it's a fucking fantastic game.

4745
09:41:23,099 --> 09:41:25,099
I highly recommend it. If you have a 360

4746
09:41:25,099 --> 09:41:27,099
and there's a hard drive inside of it,

4747
09:41:27,099 --> 09:41:29,099
get Tony Hawk's Underground. Tony Hawk's Underground 2

4748
09:41:29,099 --> 09:41:31,790
is behind me.

4749
09:41:31,790 --> 09:41:37,660
It's right there.

4750
09:41:37,660 --> 09:41:41,760
You can play that at some point, too.

4751
09:41:41,760 --> 09:41:44,510
That was a fucking really fun time.

4752
09:41:44,510 --> 09:41:46,510
We stepped over the

4753
09:41:46,510 --> 09:41:48,510
we stepped over the meltdown

4754
09:41:48,510 --> 09:41:50,510
area. We just put our toe over it.

4755
09:41:50,510 --> 09:41:52,510
It'll last like an hour and a half.

4756
09:41:52,510 --> 09:42:01,459
We're good. Just enough to

4757
09:42:01,459 --> 09:42:03,699
have an issue.

4758
09:42:03,699 --> 09:42:07,730
It was a lot of fun.

4759
09:42:07,730 --> 09:42:09,730
Seriously, these games are fucking incredible.

4760
09:42:09,730 --> 09:42:11,730
I had an absolute blast.

4761
09:42:11,730 --> 09:42:13,730
I'm so happy I got to experience this

4762
09:42:13,730 --> 09:42:15,730
because I played all the main ones.

4763
09:42:15,730 --> 09:42:17,730
Tony Hawk, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3,

4764
09:42:17,730 --> 09:42:19,730
Tony Hawk 4. I never really

4765
09:42:19,730 --> 09:42:21,730
did this one.

4766
09:42:21,730 --> 09:42:23,730
I played it like here and there randomly, but

4767
09:42:23,730 --> 09:42:25,730
I never really played it.

4768
09:42:25,730 --> 09:42:28,290
But let's do the alternate ending.

4769
09:42:28,290 --> 09:42:30,290
This is what happens if what? What's the

4770
09:42:30,290 --> 09:42:35,540
scenario here?

4771
09:42:35,540 --> 09:42:37,540
How does this end? What's the scenario?

4772
09:42:42,269 --> 09:42:44,269
Why does this happen?

4773
09:42:44,269 --> 09:42:51,500
Somebody link it right here.

4774
09:42:51,500 --> 09:42:53,500
This is

4775
09:42:53,500 --> 09:42:55,500
Tony Hawk's Underground alternate

4776
09:42:55,500 --> 09:42:59,339
ending. Make sure I can

4777
09:42:59,339 --> 09:43:04,339
hear. Make sure you

4778
09:43:04,339 --> 09:43:06,339
guys can hear, too.

4779
09:43:06,339 --> 09:43:08,339
That's important. Alright, let's watch it.

4780
09:43:08,339 --> 09:43:16,589
Here we go. This is the

4781
09:43:16,589 --> 09:43:18,589
alternate ending to Tony Hawk Underground.

4782
09:43:24,589 --> 09:43:26,589
Aww.

4783
09:43:26,589 --> 09:43:28,589
How cute.

4784
09:43:28,589 --> 09:43:30,589
Two little skaters and their

4785
09:43:30,589 --> 09:43:32,589
ghetto shop.

4786
09:43:32,589 --> 09:43:34,589
Her Juvideo went over pretty good.

4787
09:43:34,589 --> 09:43:36,589
I guess kids dig that goofy soul skating crap.

4788
09:43:36,589 --> 09:43:38,830
I tell you what,

4789
09:43:38,830 --> 09:43:40,830
I'll buy you out for half a mil right now.

4790
09:43:40,830 --> 09:43:42,830
I got my checkbook.

4791
09:43:42,830 --> 09:43:45,010
I told you. It was never about the money.

4792
09:43:45,010 --> 09:43:47,010
Right, right, I forgot.

4793
09:43:47,010 --> 09:43:49,010
Mr. Pure,

4794
09:43:49,010 --> 09:43:51,010
I should have fixed you back in Tampa.

4795
09:43:51,010 --> 09:43:53,010
Tell it to your posse. We're through.

4796
09:43:53,010 --> 09:43:55,809
I've got everything I need.

4797
09:43:55,809 --> 09:43:58,050
Not this. Remember?

4798
09:43:58,050 --> 09:44:00,050
Hawaii building jump?

4799
09:44:00,050 --> 09:44:02,050
Helicopter? That was some sick

4800
09:44:02,050 --> 09:44:04,050
footage. Too bad no one ever

4801
09:44:04,050 --> 09:44:06,050
saw it. You backstabbing

4802
09:44:06,050 --> 09:44:08,050
mob flipping cockroach.

4803
09:44:08,050 --> 09:44:10,050
Hey, what do you say?

4804
09:44:10,050 --> 09:44:12,050
One last trip around the neighborhood.

4805
09:44:12,050 --> 09:44:14,050
Winner takes the

4806
09:44:14,050 --> 09:44:16,860
tape.

4807
09:44:16,860 --> 09:44:29,339
I wanted to do that.

4808
09:44:29,339 --> 09:44:33,180
That was...

4809
09:44:33,180 --> 09:44:35,180
Remember I was saying, like, why can't I just push

4810
09:44:35,180 --> 09:44:37,180
him over and get it? Why can't I throw him down

4811
09:44:37,180 --> 09:44:39,180
and get it? Wow.

4812
09:44:39,180 --> 09:44:54,849
How do you get this ending?

4813
09:44:54,849 --> 09:44:56,849
You got to get that scene. You have to earn it.

4814
09:44:56,849 --> 09:44:58,849
You beat the game a second time. Oh.

4815
09:44:58,849 --> 09:45:00,849
So when you get through a second time, they're just like, yeah.

4816
09:45:00,849 --> 09:45:02,849
You can just push him over. You don't have to do

4817
09:45:02,849 --> 09:45:04,849
the hard line

4818
09:45:04,849 --> 09:45:06,849
thing. That's funny.

4819
09:45:06,849 --> 09:45:10,050
Alright, that's where we're going to end it.

4820
09:45:10,050 --> 09:45:12,050
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Diablo 2

4821
09:45:12,050 --> 09:45:15,500
Hardcore. It's been a while. It's been

4822
09:45:15,500 --> 09:45:18,699
a week, a couple of weeks actually,

4823
09:45:18,699 --> 09:45:20,699
hasn't it? It's been like week and a half.

4824
09:45:20,699 --> 09:45:26,589
See if we can beat Diablo.

4825
09:45:26,589 --> 09:45:32,660
I'm looking forward to it.

4826
09:45:32,660 --> 09:45:34,660
See you tomorrow. Starting at the same time

4827
09:45:34,660 --> 09:45:37,860
so probably around two o'clock.

4828
09:45:37,860 --> 09:45:40,480
Somewhere, yeah, two-ish. Two.

4829
09:45:40,480 --> 09:45:44,190
Same time. But let's do the bits.

4830
09:45:44,190 --> 09:45:46,190
Let's go back earlier.

4831
09:45:46,190 --> 09:45:48,190
I got to get this off my screen because

4832
09:45:48,190 --> 09:45:50,190
it's covering up everything. Thanks for joining me.

4833
09:45:50,190 --> 09:45:52,190
Thanks for joining us.

4834
09:45:52,190 --> 09:45:57,739
Hope you had a good time. I did.

4835
09:45:57,739 --> 09:45:59,739
We'll see you all tomorrow. Take care. Get some sleep.

4836
09:45:59,739 --> 09:46:02,750
See you soon.

4837
09:46:02,750 --> 09:46:07,220
But let's do the bits.

4838
09:46:07,220 --> 09:46:09,220
It's time for slime. Thanks for 500

4839
09:46:09,220 --> 09:46:11,459
bits. They say thug

4840
09:46:11,459 --> 09:46:14,720
hype. This was

4841
09:46:14,720 --> 09:46:16,720
one of those streams. A lot of people were waiting for it

4842
09:46:16,720 --> 09:46:21,139
and it was a good one.

4843
09:46:21,139 --> 09:46:23,139
Jay Onzel.

4844
09:46:23,139 --> 09:46:25,139
Thanks for the 300 bits. Hi, Jeremiah. I was so hyped

4845
09:46:25,139 --> 09:46:27,139
for the stream today because I loved this game and I'm just imagining

4846
09:46:27,139 --> 09:46:29,139
you as the Steve Buscemi skater meme.

4847
09:46:29,139 --> 09:46:32,980
We had a wink too?

4848
09:46:32,980 --> 09:46:37,569
That's a real wink.

4849
09:46:37,569 --> 09:46:44,160
Alright, let's go.

4850
09:46:44,160 --> 09:46:49,410
What was that image? Why was that like

4851
09:46:49,410 --> 09:47:01,629
back here? Look,

4852
09:47:01,629 --> 09:47:12,580
how long have I been in darkness?

4853
09:47:12,580 --> 09:47:21,650
This room's not dark.

4854
09:47:21,650 --> 09:47:23,650
You want me to blow up your immersion right now?

4855
09:47:23,650 --> 09:47:35,419
The room's not dark.

4856
09:47:35,419 --> 09:47:37,860
Holy shit, that's pretty bad here.

4857
09:47:37,860 --> 09:47:40,860
The exposure was down

4858
09:47:40,860 --> 09:47:42,860
low because I started the stream during the

4859
09:47:42,860 --> 09:47:46,000
day. Sorry, guys.

4860
09:47:46,000 --> 09:48:01,790
You look tired. Audio

4861
09:48:01,790 --> 09:48:03,790
is, yeah, audio's bad because of the

4862
09:48:03,790 --> 09:48:07,629
uh, I wonder why.

4863
09:48:07,629 --> 09:48:12,940
It's past my bedtime. No, I

4864
09:48:12,940 --> 09:48:16,339
guess I gotta eat something. I gotta

4865
09:48:16,339 --> 09:48:18,339
eat something. I ate

4866
09:48:18,339 --> 09:48:20,339
before the stream, but as a lot of you guys

4867
09:48:20,339 --> 09:48:22,339
know, I don't eat on stream.

4868
09:48:22,339 --> 09:48:24,339
Not usually.

4869
09:48:24,339 --> 09:48:26,339
I don't really like it. I did wink. Yes, I did

4870
09:48:26,339 --> 09:48:28,339
when it was dark. Fine, you wanna

4871
09:48:28,339 --> 09:48:38,129
loop Honda. Thanks for the 300

4872
09:48:38,129 --> 09:48:40,129
bits. They say uncanny. Uncanny.

4873
09:48:40,129 --> 09:48:42,300
Yes, it's online. 300

4874
09:48:42,300 --> 09:48:44,300
bits. Never thought in my life I would hear a

4875
09:48:44,300 --> 09:48:46,300
Quasimodo song on a Jerma stream.

4876
09:48:46,300 --> 09:48:51,040
Yeah, sorry to all

4877
09:48:51,040 --> 09:48:53,040
the VOD watchers. You probably

4878
09:48:53,040 --> 09:48:55,040
won't be able to watch any of this

4879
09:48:55,040 --> 09:48:57,470
stream. There's probably gonna be chunks

4880
09:48:57,470 --> 09:48:59,470
that are watchable, but

4881
09:48:59,470 --> 09:49:10,099
start the video now.

4882
09:49:10,099 --> 09:49:12,099
It hasn't taken on yet.

4883
09:49:12,099 --> 09:49:14,099
Quick. Load it into cache

4884
09:49:14,099 --> 09:49:16,099
on your browser. Quick. Do it.

4885
09:49:16,099 --> 09:49:18,720
Yeah, because I'm almost, this whole stream's

4886
09:49:18,720 --> 09:49:20,720
gonna be gone. But this was a, uh,

4887
09:49:20,720 --> 09:49:22,720
this was a fun live only

4888
09:49:22,720 --> 09:49:25,279
stream because there was just copyright

4889
09:49:25,279 --> 09:49:27,279
music playing almost the entire game.

4890
09:49:27,279 --> 09:49:30,540
Download it.

4891
09:49:30,540 --> 09:49:33,680
Yeah, thanks. AtroLux

4892
09:49:33,680 --> 09:49:35,680
Atrox, thanks for the thousand bits.

4893
09:49:35,680 --> 09:49:37,680
Ten dollars. Oh, there's nothing on the screen.

4894
09:49:37,680 --> 09:49:43,309
Thank you AtroLux.

4895
09:49:43,309 --> 09:49:45,309
Dropping this because this game is in my top five ever

4896
09:49:45,309 --> 09:49:48,059
thanks for playing it, man.

4897
09:49:48,059 --> 09:49:53,949
It is really, really, really good.

4898
09:49:53,949 --> 09:49:56,449
I wish they would make more of these.

4899
09:49:56,449 --> 09:49:58,750
Sorry.

4900
09:49:58,750 --> 09:50:02,209
Something in the throat there.

4901
09:50:02,209 --> 09:50:04,830
I wish they would make more of these and not

4902
09:50:04,830 --> 09:50:07,260
iPad games.

4903
09:50:07,260 --> 09:50:09,260
But I'm not sure if there's a market for it anymore.

4904
09:50:09,260 --> 09:50:11,260
Let's talk sad

4905
09:50:11,260 --> 09:50:13,500
truths here. I don't know

4906
09:50:13,500 --> 09:50:15,500
if there's really a huge market for

4907
09:50:15,500 --> 09:50:17,500
arcade skating games anymore.

4908
09:50:17,500 --> 09:50:20,379
Everybody wants skate 4.

4909
09:50:20,379 --> 09:50:22,379
Skate 4, people

4910
09:50:22,379 --> 09:50:24,379
requested every single year.

4911
09:50:24,379 --> 09:50:27,900
But I don't know if they would

4912
09:50:27,900 --> 09:50:29,900
What? What's going on?

4913
09:50:29,900 --> 09:50:31,900
Oh, God.

4914
09:50:31,900 --> 09:50:34,139
Sorry.

4915
09:50:34,139 --> 09:50:36,959
I just don't know. There might not be a

4916
09:50:36,959 --> 09:50:45,919
market for it anymore. It's just

4917
09:50:45,919 --> 09:50:47,919
it kind of fell out of popular

4918
09:50:47,919 --> 09:50:52,459
culture. There's a lot

4919
09:50:52,459 --> 09:50:54,459
of die hard fans of these games

4920
09:50:54,459 --> 09:50:56,459
for very good reason.

4921
09:50:56,459 --> 09:50:58,459
And I would say I would be one of them.

4922
09:50:58,459 --> 09:51:01,150
I never played skate, though.

4923
09:51:01,150 --> 09:51:03,459
I heard skate 3 was good. I never played it.

4924
09:51:03,459 --> 09:51:06,139
But I have played all the Tony Hawk's.

4925
09:51:06,139 --> 09:51:10,690
Pretty much. But people love it.

4926
09:51:10,690 --> 09:51:16,129
People love these things.

4927
09:51:16,129 --> 09:51:20,669
You did, didn't you?

4928
09:51:20,669 --> 09:51:22,669
I did not play skate 3.

4929
09:51:22,669 --> 09:51:25,419
Skate 3, no.

4930
09:51:25,419 --> 09:51:27,419
Tony Hawk 2.

4931
09:51:27,419 --> 09:51:29,419
You're probably thinking of Tony Hawk 2.

4932
09:51:29,419 --> 09:51:31,919
Yeah. That's definitely what you're thinking of.

4933
09:51:31,919 --> 09:51:38,639
Yeah.

4934
09:51:38,639 --> 09:51:40,639
Bulbaswag, thanks for the 999

4935
09:51:40,639 --> 09:51:42,639
bits. 999.

4936
09:51:42,639 --> 09:51:44,639
I've been on vacation, so I've missed the last few streams.

4937
09:51:44,639 --> 09:51:49,949
They look like a blast, though.

4938
09:51:49,949 --> 09:51:53,339
Yeah, I think Outer Wilds

4939
09:51:53,339 --> 09:51:55,339
was fun and

4940
09:51:55,339 --> 09:51:57,339
interesting. This stream was

4941
09:51:57,339 --> 09:51:59,580
kind of crazy and all

4942
09:51:59,580 --> 09:52:04,319
over the place. A lot of different

4943
09:52:04,319 --> 09:52:06,620
streams this week.

4944
09:52:06,620 --> 09:52:09,819
We're really going to chill out tomorrow.

4945
09:52:09,819 --> 09:52:14,430
He did play it.

4946
09:52:14,430 --> 09:52:16,430
I don't know. I don't click links in my chat.

4947
09:52:16,430 --> 09:52:19,379
Sorry.

4948
09:52:19,379 --> 09:52:21,379
We started. We watched like an

4949
09:52:21,379 --> 09:52:23,379
action movie with Siraswrath.

4950
09:52:23,379 --> 09:52:26,000
And then we did

4951
09:52:26,000 --> 09:52:28,000
explore and do the puzzle game

4952
09:52:28,000 --> 09:52:30,000
and figure out the

4953
09:52:30,000 --> 09:52:32,000
Outer Wilds.

4954
09:52:32,000 --> 09:52:34,000
And then we had a stream

4955
09:52:34,000 --> 09:52:36,000
today, which was

4956
09:52:36,000 --> 09:52:38,430
I laughed like every five seconds

4957
09:52:38,430 --> 09:52:40,669
of this stream. And then tomorrow

4958
09:52:40,669 --> 09:52:42,669
we're just going to dial it back and do a chill stream tomorrow.

4959
09:52:42,669 --> 09:52:45,809
He liked an old Tony Hawk game

4960
09:52:45,809 --> 09:52:47,809
better than Outer Wilds.

4961
09:52:47,809 --> 09:52:52,419
That's not fair, though.

4962
09:52:52,419 --> 09:52:54,419
Do I have any interest in Warcraft 3

4963
09:52:54,419 --> 09:52:56,419
Reforged? No.

4964
09:52:56,419 --> 09:52:58,419
Because I heard it sucks.

4965
09:52:58,419 --> 09:53:06,220
I heard

4966
09:53:06,220 --> 09:53:08,400
it's really not that

4967
09:53:08,400 --> 09:53:10,400
much of a reforging

4968
09:53:10,400 --> 09:53:12,400
and more of a repainting.

4969
09:53:12,400 --> 09:53:23,410
So I don't know

4970
09:53:23,410 --> 09:53:25,410
if I'm going to care that much about it.

4971
09:53:25,410 --> 09:53:27,410
It also

4972
09:53:27,410 --> 09:53:30,029
it also does not give me

4973
09:53:30,029 --> 09:53:32,029
very much confidence in what

4974
09:53:32,029 --> 09:53:34,029
Diablo 4 is going to look like.

4975
09:53:34,029 --> 09:53:43,949
From my understanding

4976
09:53:43,949 --> 09:53:45,949
it's kind of

4977
09:53:45,949 --> 09:53:47,949
stripped a bunch of stuff from it.

4978
09:53:47,949 --> 09:53:49,949
The graphics really aren't that good.

4979
09:53:49,949 --> 09:53:52,129
They didn't really remake

4980
09:53:52,129 --> 09:53:54,129
very much. They kind of upped some textures

4981
09:53:54,129 --> 09:53:56,129
and some models, right?

4982
09:53:56,129 --> 09:54:07,459
Custom maps you don't own anymore.

4983
09:54:07,459 --> 09:54:09,459
It belongs to Blizzard. Well, you know why they're

4984
09:54:09,459 --> 09:54:11,459
doing that, right? You know

4985
09:54:11,459 --> 09:54:13,459
why they're doing the custom games or

4986
09:54:13,459 --> 09:54:15,459
ours? Because look what happened

4987
09:54:15,459 --> 09:54:19,680
to Dota. Dota was

4988
09:54:19,680 --> 09:54:21,680
created in one of their IPs.

4989
09:54:21,680 --> 09:54:24,110
And it

4990
09:54:24,110 --> 09:54:26,110
created one of the biggest video

4991
09:54:26,110 --> 09:54:28,110
game genres

4992
09:54:28,110 --> 09:54:30,989
on Earth. And they couldn't

4993
09:54:30,989 --> 09:54:32,989
take it. They couldn't control it.

4994
09:54:32,989 --> 09:54:37,790
So in their minds

4995
09:54:37,790 --> 09:54:39,790
what they're probably thinking is if another

4996
09:54:39,790 --> 09:54:41,790
Dota comes up in these custom

4997
09:54:41,790 --> 09:54:44,480
games, we will own it.

4998
09:54:44,480 --> 09:54:57,089
No one's going to make custom games

4999
09:54:57,089 --> 09:54:59,900
now. I would probably jump on

5000
09:54:59,900 --> 09:55:01,900
and mess around in tower defense. That was

5001
09:55:01,900 --> 09:55:03,900
one of my favorite things to do.

5002
09:55:03,900 --> 09:55:05,900
Tower defense, hero line wars.

5003
09:55:05,900 --> 09:55:08,139
It was a lot of fun.

5004
09:55:08,139 --> 09:55:10,139
But you kind of take away the incentive

5005
09:55:10,139 --> 09:55:12,830
to make a

5006
09:55:12,830 --> 09:55:15,139
game mode for us.

5007
09:55:15,139 --> 09:55:17,139
Make a new fun custom game.

5008
09:55:17,139 --> 09:55:19,309
But if anyone ever thinks

5009
09:55:19,309 --> 09:55:21,809
it's good, you can't

5010
09:55:21,809 --> 09:55:23,809
have it. It's ours.

5011
09:55:23,809 --> 09:55:27,650
You're ours now.

5012
09:55:27,650 --> 09:55:30,980
Custom game Golden Age

5013
09:55:30,980 --> 09:55:32,980
is long over. People just download Unity and Unreal.

5014
09:55:32,980 --> 09:55:34,980
But they actually have the chance to

5015
09:55:34,980 --> 09:55:36,980
make money. That's also another really good point.

5016
09:55:36,980 --> 09:55:38,980
That's a good point. That's a great point actually.

5017
09:55:38,980 --> 09:55:41,790
That you can just make

5018
09:55:41,790 --> 09:55:43,790
your own game now.

5019
09:55:43,790 --> 09:55:45,790
There's a lot of tools now that were sort of out of reach.

5020
09:55:45,790 --> 09:55:47,790
Some 15, 20 years ago.

5021
09:55:47,790 --> 09:56:00,080
I've played Beautiful Joe.

5022
09:56:00,080 --> 09:56:02,080
I have. They're amazing games.

5023
09:56:02,080 --> 09:56:04,080
Both of them.

5024
09:56:04,080 --> 09:56:06,379
Some of the best

5025
09:56:06,379 --> 09:56:08,379
GameCube and PS2 games.

5026
09:56:08,379 --> 09:56:10,379
Love them.

5027
09:56:10,379 --> 09:56:12,379
And they are behind me.

5028
09:56:12,379 --> 09:56:14,379
They're in two cases behind me. We're going to play them

5029
09:56:14,379 --> 09:56:21,870
very soon.

5030
09:56:21,870 --> 09:56:23,870
But let's keep going before it gets too late.

5031
09:56:23,870 --> 09:56:28,860
But thank you. That was Bulbaswag.

5032
09:56:28,860 --> 09:56:31,620
Thank you for the $9.99.

5033
09:56:31,620 --> 09:56:33,620
Rastnama, thanks for the 500 bits.

5034
09:56:33,620 --> 09:56:35,620
The first stream I've been able to catch.

5035
09:56:35,620 --> 09:56:37,620
Busy with college and life. I've been watching your stuff on YouTube for a while.

5036
09:56:37,620 --> 09:56:39,620
Glad I can actually catch a stream for even a small

5037
09:56:39,620 --> 09:56:41,620
while.

5038
09:56:41,620 --> 09:56:47,300
Appreciate you, Jerma. Glad to have you.

5039
09:56:47,300 --> 09:56:49,300
Thanks for stopping by and thanks for

5040
09:56:49,300 --> 09:56:53,120
$5.

5041
09:56:53,120 --> 09:56:55,120
One Trick Gaming, thanks for the five community subs.

5042
09:56:55,120 --> 09:56:57,419
Enyaz, thanks for the

5043
09:56:57,419 --> 09:56:59,419
$5.00. 500 bits.

5044
09:56:59,419 --> 09:57:01,660
Jerma, I'm a recent fan.

5045
09:57:01,660 --> 09:57:04,029
Since about October.

5046
09:57:04,029 --> 09:57:06,029
Cool. Welcome.

5047
09:57:06,029 --> 09:57:08,029
I'm giving you bits tonight as your Dreamcast video that just went up

5048
09:57:08,029 --> 09:57:10,029
was the only thing keeping me from falling into shock

5049
09:57:10,029 --> 09:57:12,029
because I just discovered a family member

5050
09:57:12,029 --> 09:57:14,029
took their life this morning.

5051
09:57:14,029 --> 09:57:16,029
That's horrible. I'm really sorry to hear that.

5052
09:57:16,029 --> 09:57:21,470
I am so sorry to hear that.

5053
09:57:21,470 --> 09:57:25,120
I'm in the UK studying abroad

5054
09:57:25,120 --> 09:57:27,120
in university. I'm away from my family

5055
09:57:27,120 --> 09:57:29,120
who live in the west of Ireland.

5056
09:57:29,120 --> 09:57:31,489
And your voice is keeping me calm.

5057
09:57:31,489 --> 09:57:33,489
So I needed to say thanks and keep doing you.

5058
09:57:33,489 --> 09:57:37,839
Enyaz, you're about to go

5059
09:57:37,839 --> 09:57:39,839
through, and you currently are going

5060
09:57:39,839 --> 09:57:41,839
through, a very, very, very, very difficult

5061
09:57:41,839 --> 09:57:45,739
time. Stay strong.

5062
09:57:45,739 --> 09:57:49,069
That's a really

5063
09:57:49,069 --> 09:57:54,129
terrible thing to happen.

5064
09:57:54,129 --> 09:57:56,129
Seek guidance if you need to.

5065
09:57:56,129 --> 09:58:03,279
Breathe.

5066
09:58:03,279 --> 09:58:05,709
Keep your head on your shoulders. That's tough.

5067
09:58:05,709 --> 09:58:09,940
Thank you so much for the

5068
09:58:09,940 --> 09:58:11,940
$500 bits.

5069
09:58:11,940 --> 09:58:13,940
I wish you and your family the best.

5070
09:58:13,940 --> 09:58:21,099
Thank you again.

5071
09:58:21,099 --> 09:58:31,860
We have five community subs from

5072
09:58:31,860 --> 09:58:37,419
Ferlitty. Thank you

5073
09:58:37,419 --> 09:58:40,239
Ferlitty. And just to touch on that

5074
09:58:40,239 --> 09:58:42,540
one more time about something.

5075
09:58:42,540 --> 09:58:44,540
I've been

5076
09:58:44,540 --> 09:58:46,540
fairly fortunate in my life

5077
09:58:46,540 --> 09:58:48,720
to not have somebody

5078
09:58:48,720 --> 09:58:50,720
potentially close to me pass away

5079
09:58:50,720 --> 09:58:55,650
suddenly. I can't imagine

5080
09:58:55,650 --> 09:58:57,650
the pain that

5081
09:58:57,650 --> 09:59:09,040
people could be feeling when that happens.

5082
09:59:09,040 --> 09:59:11,040
We joke around a lot and we fuck around

5083
09:59:11,040 --> 09:59:16,540
a lot on this stream

5084
09:59:16,540 --> 09:59:21,019
and stuff like that. I'm just

5085
09:59:21,019 --> 09:59:23,019
really, really, really sorry.

5086
09:59:23,019 --> 09:59:25,709
I cannot even imagine.

5087
09:59:25,709 --> 09:59:28,910
As I think about my life, you think about

5088
09:59:28,910 --> 09:59:30,910
what you and people

5089
09:59:30,910 --> 09:59:32,910
that you know that you've maybe seen

5090
09:59:32,910 --> 09:59:34,910
or done things with or grown up with.

5091
09:59:34,910 --> 09:59:37,790
I think that's why a lot of

5092
09:59:37,790 --> 09:59:41,889
people can feel

5093
09:59:41,889 --> 09:59:43,889
because you put yourself in that scenario.

5094
09:59:43,889 --> 09:59:49,580
Somebody said

5095
09:59:49,580 --> 09:59:51,580
life's unpredictable. Be safe.

5096
09:59:51,580 --> 09:59:55,300
Just do your best.

5097
09:59:55,300 --> 09:59:58,110
Do the best you can. That's all you can do.

5098
09:59:58,110 --> 10:00:02,779
I just wanted to kind of

5099
10:00:02,779 --> 10:00:04,779
say something else about that

5100
10:00:04,779 --> 10:00:06,779
because that's

5101
10:00:06,779 --> 10:00:09,220
not fun.

5102
10:00:09,220 --> 10:00:11,220
That's tough stuff.

5103
10:00:11,220 --> 10:00:14,160
The best you can is good enough. That's true.

5104
10:00:14,160 --> 10:00:17,300
Just do the best you can.

5105
10:00:17,300 --> 10:00:23,699
But SquimPST

5106
10:00:23,699 --> 10:00:25,699
gave 400 bits.

5107
10:00:25,699 --> 10:00:27,699
I've been wheel throwing this whole stream

5108
10:00:27,699 --> 10:00:29,699
and all I can think about is Bugleberry Pottery

5109
10:00:29,699 --> 10:00:31,699
ASMR, so thank you for that.

5110
10:00:31,699 --> 10:00:36,500
Nice.

5111
10:00:36,500 --> 10:00:41,099
You got a wheel? I imagine that would be

5112
10:00:41,099 --> 10:00:43,099
really, really relaxing just to throw on like a

5113
10:00:43,099 --> 10:00:45,099
TV show or a YouTube video

5114
10:00:45,099 --> 10:00:47,410
or stream and just wheel throw.

5115
10:00:47,410 --> 10:00:50,099
You can just sit there for

5116
10:00:50,099 --> 10:00:52,099
hours doing it.

5117
10:00:52,099 --> 10:00:56,000
Your viewers just plummeted to zero.

5118
10:00:56,000 --> 10:01:00,739
It's kind of just like a

5119
10:01:00,739 --> 10:01:02,739
neat little trick.

5120
10:01:02,739 --> 10:01:04,739
You know what I mean?

5121
10:01:04,739 --> 10:01:06,739
I know that I can do it.

5122
10:01:06,739 --> 10:01:08,739
But I can't do it as well as a lot of people

5123
10:01:08,739 --> 10:01:12,500
that are very, very good at it.

5124
10:01:12,500 --> 10:01:14,500
So it's almost just like a

5125
10:01:14,500 --> 10:01:16,500
neat little thing

5126
10:01:16,500 --> 10:01:18,500
that I can just turn on sometimes.

5127
10:01:18,500 --> 10:01:20,800
You look at some professional beatboxers

5128
10:01:20,800 --> 10:01:22,800
and you're like,

5129
10:01:22,800 --> 10:01:25,040
I'm going to beatbox

5130
10:01:25,040 --> 10:01:27,980
and I'm going to beatbox

5131
10:01:27,980 --> 10:01:31,379
and I'm going to beatbox

5132
10:01:31,379 --> 10:01:33,379
You look at some professional beatboxers

5133
10:01:33,379 --> 10:01:35,870
they run circles around the stuff that I'm doing.

5134
10:01:35,870 --> 10:01:39,330
So capitalize

5135
10:01:39,330 --> 10:01:41,330
on an album. I don't

5136
10:01:41,330 --> 10:01:43,330
I'm not sure. It's kind of just like a hobby

5137
10:01:43,330 --> 10:01:45,330
thing. I just do it sometimes. I'll be in the shower

5138
10:01:45,330 --> 10:01:55,250
just doing it. But I

5139
10:01:55,250 --> 10:01:57,250
appreciate the fact that you think that it's good enough to

5140
10:01:57,250 --> 10:01:59,870
do that. You have the first

5141
10:01:59,870 --> 10:02:01,870
beatboxing gamer.

5142
10:02:01,870 --> 10:02:04,300
There are probably others.

5143
10:02:12,989 --> 10:02:14,989
I was initially a little

5144
10:02:14,989 --> 10:02:16,989
It was a little tough hearing my own voice in recordings

5145
10:02:16,989 --> 10:02:18,989
but I'm gradually getting used to it.

5146
10:02:18,989 --> 10:02:20,989
If you have any tips for a newcomer, I'd appreciate them.

5147
10:02:20,989 --> 10:02:22,989
Thanks for being you.

5148
10:02:22,989 --> 10:02:26,319
Something I learned a long

5149
10:02:26,319 --> 10:02:28,620
time ago is

5150
10:02:28,620 --> 10:02:30,620
do what you want to do.

5151
10:02:30,620 --> 10:02:33,629
It can get really, really

5152
10:02:33,629 --> 10:02:35,629
tricky.

5153
10:02:35,629 --> 10:02:37,629
You can kind of get in your own way

5154
10:02:37,629 --> 10:02:40,959
when you start to think about

5155
10:02:40,959 --> 10:02:42,959
instead of what you would want to do, what would

5156
10:02:42,959 --> 10:02:50,059
somebody else want to do.

5157
10:02:50,059 --> 10:02:52,059
Try not to compare yourself to other people.

5158
10:02:52,059 --> 10:02:54,059
That's also tough too because you're like oh

5159
10:02:54,059 --> 10:02:56,059
this person and me and this person do this

5160
10:02:56,059 --> 10:02:58,059
and how many people watch?

5161
10:02:58,059 --> 10:03:00,059
How many people sub to that person?

5162
10:03:00,059 --> 10:03:02,059
How many viewers do they have on YouTube?

5163
10:03:02,059 --> 10:03:04,059
Their videos are better than mine.

5164
10:03:04,059 --> 10:03:06,059
No they're not. I gotta make a better video. I gotta try

5165
10:03:06,059 --> 10:03:08,059
to make a better video than them. You can get

5166
10:03:08,059 --> 10:03:10,879
lost. Do you

5167
10:03:10,879 --> 10:03:13,120
do what you want to do and stock

5168
10:03:13,120 --> 10:03:16,580
up on baby food. The last part is

5169
10:03:16,580 --> 10:03:27,330
not a joke. We add

5170
10:03:27,330 --> 10:03:29,330
$30

5171
10:03:29,330 --> 10:03:31,330
Yeah 3000 bits from

5172
10:03:31,330 --> 10:03:33,330
Go Ike

5173
10:03:33,330 --> 10:03:38,510
$30 fucking dollars. It's a lot of money.

5174
10:03:38,510 --> 10:03:41,459
They say skate or die. Skate or die.

5175
10:03:41,459 --> 10:03:43,949
Thanks for the huge amount of money. That's 30

5176
10:03:43,949 --> 10:03:46,769
bucks. Is that a college tip?

5177
10:03:46,769 --> 10:03:49,459
No it's a streamer tip. That's a real

5178
10:03:49,459 --> 10:03:52,269
streamer tip. Alright so it's been

5179
10:03:52,269 --> 10:03:54,269
10 hours. You hear me out on this. This is very important.

5180
10:03:54,269 --> 10:03:56,269
It's been 10

5181
10:03:56,269 --> 10:03:58,269
hours of this stream being turned on.

5182
10:03:58,269 --> 10:04:03,900
I've gotten up from the chair a couple times.

5183
10:04:03,900 --> 10:04:05,900
I peed but I'm back here in about

5184
10:04:05,900 --> 10:04:07,900
2 minutes, 3 minutes each time.

5185
10:04:07,900 --> 10:04:10,529
10 hours and like

5186
10:04:10,529 --> 10:04:12,529
5 minutes of time

5187
10:04:12,529 --> 10:04:14,529
not on camera or not

5188
10:04:14,529 --> 10:04:18,370
on broadcast.

5189
10:04:18,370 --> 10:04:20,370
You gotta eat something. You gotta drink something.

5190
10:04:20,370 --> 10:04:22,370
You gotta have something available.

5191
10:04:22,370 --> 10:04:25,059
We've been here for 10 hours. Baby food.

5192
10:04:25,059 --> 10:04:28,319
Those little baby food packets

5193
10:04:28,319 --> 10:04:30,319
or even the little jars.

5194
10:04:30,319 --> 10:04:32,319
You can eat those in 5 seconds.

5195
10:04:32,319 --> 10:04:34,559
You know how easy it is to drink

5196
10:04:34,559 --> 10:04:36,559
just to slurp down one of those baby food

5197
10:04:36,559 --> 10:04:38,800
packets? It's got

5198
10:04:38,800 --> 10:04:40,800
vitamins. It's got fruits. It's

5199
10:04:40,800 --> 10:04:42,800
real shit. It's food. It's

5200
10:04:42,800 --> 10:04:47,279
just liquified. It's bananas.

5201
10:04:47,279 --> 10:04:49,279
Apples.

5202
10:04:49,279 --> 10:04:54,910
I'm not joking. No.

5203
10:04:54,910 --> 10:04:57,339
Stay here.

5204
10:04:57,339 --> 10:05:59,660
Okay.

5205
10:05:59,660 --> 10:06:23,440
Let me fix this. Okay.

5206
10:06:23,440 --> 10:06:25,440
So those of you that said this was not real.

5207
10:06:25,440 --> 10:06:30,349
It is. It's very real.

5208
10:06:30,349 --> 10:06:33,040
This is apple

5209
10:06:33,040 --> 10:06:35,919
banana. This is real.

5210
10:06:35,919 --> 10:06:38,160
Apple, banana, fruit on the go.

5211
10:06:38,160 --> 10:06:40,160
All natural. No spoon. You just twist

5212
10:06:40,160 --> 10:06:45,150
the shit off. Apple, banana,

5213
10:06:45,150 --> 10:06:47,150
fruit on the go. This is designed

5214
10:06:47,150 --> 10:06:49,150
for small children. Look at how small

5215
10:06:49,150 --> 10:06:56,769
this is. You give these

5216
10:06:56,769 --> 10:06:59,970
pouches to kids.

5217
10:06:59,970 --> 10:07:01,970
It's baby food. It's not baby

5218
10:07:01,970 --> 10:07:07,139
food. I mean,

5219
10:07:07,139 --> 10:07:09,139
who's gonna eat this?

5220
10:07:09,139 --> 10:07:11,440
Besides a baby. Who do you

5221
10:07:11,440 --> 10:07:13,440
know that's going to eat this besides a baby

5222
10:07:13,440 --> 10:07:16,699
or a toddler? Me.

5223
10:07:16,699 --> 10:07:45,680
Look at how simple this is. Done.

5224
10:07:45,680 --> 10:07:50,459
I just ate a full meal in

5225
10:07:50,459 --> 10:07:52,459
12 seconds.

5226
10:07:52,459 --> 10:08:02,690
Done. I can keep going.

5227
10:08:02,690 --> 10:08:06,339
A full baby meal.

5228
10:08:06,339 --> 10:08:08,339
Yeah, but a full baby meal is still a full

5229
10:08:08,339 --> 10:08:10,339
meal for somebody.

5230
10:08:10,339 --> 10:08:12,339
A full baby meal can keep

5231
10:08:12,339 --> 10:08:14,339
you going for another couple hours on live stream.

5232
10:08:14,339 --> 10:08:18,690
Or beef jerky.

5233
10:08:18,690 --> 10:08:23,620
I'm not crazy.

5234
10:08:23,620 --> 10:08:30,720
Everybody else is. It's really good.

5235
10:08:30,720 --> 10:08:34,690
And they're fucking so fast. It's easy.

5236
10:08:34,690 --> 10:08:36,690
You gotta find, streamer

5237
10:08:36,690 --> 10:08:38,690
tip, streamer

5238
10:08:38,690 --> 10:08:40,690
tip.

5239
10:08:40,690 --> 10:08:42,690
Find something that you can eat, that you can eat

5240
10:08:42,690 --> 10:08:44,690
quickly, that you can snack on.

5241
10:08:44,690 --> 10:08:46,690
Crackers. You know.

5242
10:08:46,690 --> 10:08:49,680
Cheese. Baby food.

5243
10:08:49,680 --> 10:08:51,680
Fucking go-go squeezers.

5244
10:08:51,680 --> 10:08:55,010
I don't think I was making this up.

5245
10:08:55,010 --> 10:08:59,680
You just eat an apple.

5246
10:08:59,680 --> 10:09:02,239
You know how long

5247
10:09:02,239 --> 10:09:04,239
it takes to eat a fucking apple?

5248
10:09:04,239 --> 10:09:06,239
It takes like 20 minutes

5249
10:09:06,239 --> 10:09:08,930
to eat a full apple. You have to

5250
10:09:08,930 --> 10:09:12,260
like, hey guys!

5251
10:09:14,620 --> 10:09:17,819
What do I do with the core? I got this like, fuck

5252
10:09:17,819 --> 10:09:19,819
my hands are all sticky. No. I just did it.

5253
10:09:19,819 --> 10:09:23,279
You gotta like sit there and eat it

5254
10:09:23,279 --> 10:09:25,279
and spin it around. The core is all

5255
10:09:25,279 --> 10:09:31,040
fucked up and gross.

5256
10:09:31,040 --> 10:09:33,040
You can eat the core. Don't eat, don't eat the-

5257
10:09:33,040 --> 10:09:35,040
Listen. Somebody just said that. Don't eat the fucking core

5258
10:09:35,040 --> 10:09:37,040
of an apple. Don't do that.

5259
10:09:37,040 --> 10:09:39,040
Why would you? Don't eat the core of an apple.

5260
10:09:39,040 --> 10:09:42,300
The core is- Don't eat the core of an apple.

5261
10:09:42,300 --> 10:09:44,300
Why would you don't eat the core of an apple? It's like

5262
10:09:44,300 --> 10:09:50,559
rawhide.

5263
10:09:50,559 --> 10:09:52,559
The police are coming to

5264
10:09:52,559 --> 10:09:54,559
take you somewhere

5265
10:09:54,559 --> 10:09:57,120
to get to hell.

5266
10:09:57,120 --> 10:09:59,120
It's fu- It's apple

5267
10:09:59,120 --> 10:10:01,120
sauce, guys.

5268
10:10:01,120 --> 10:10:03,120
The number one ingredient is apples

5269
10:10:03,120 --> 10:10:05,120
bananas. It's apple sauce

5270
10:10:05,120 --> 10:10:07,120
in a little jar.

5271
10:10:07,120 --> 10:10:09,120
It's not a big deal.

5272
10:10:09,120 --> 10:10:14,430
It's literally 70 calories.

5273
10:10:14,430 --> 10:10:17,379
Yeah. It's 70 fucking

5274
10:10:17,379 --> 10:10:19,379
calories of super

5275
10:10:19,379 --> 10:10:21,379
ultra hyper energy. Alright, I'm done.

5276
10:10:21,379 --> 10:10:23,739
I can't believe nobody wants to hear my fucking

5277
10:10:23,739 --> 10:10:25,739
tip. I've been doing this for a day. I've been doing this

5278
10:10:25,739 --> 10:10:27,919
I've been doing this for 10 years.

5279
10:10:27,919 --> 10:10:29,919
You don't think I've figured some secrets?

5280
10:10:29,919 --> 10:10:32,930
Some secrets seem strange.

5281
10:10:32,930 --> 10:10:36,449
I've been doing this for a decade. I think

5282
10:10:36,449 --> 10:10:44,699
I've learned a few secrets.

5283
10:10:44,699 --> 10:10:49,440
They're so good. Thank you. I'm so glad

5284
10:10:49,440 --> 10:10:51,440
that there's a human in here that can

5285
10:10:51,440 --> 10:11:03,790
back me up a little.

5286
10:11:03,790 --> 10:11:05,790
It's human detected.

5287
10:11:05,790 --> 10:11:08,480
I like these things.

5288
10:11:08,480 --> 10:11:10,480
They're really easy. And it's like

5289
10:11:10,480 --> 10:11:12,480
100 calories and then you drink

5290
10:11:12,480 --> 10:11:14,480
like a glass of fucking almond milk

5291
10:11:14,480 --> 10:11:16,480
and you've had like 200-

5292
10:11:16,480 --> 10:11:18,480
It's just a snack. You know something? Guys, I'm not

5293
10:11:18,480 --> 10:11:20,480
talking about like eating a full plate of

5294
10:11:20,480 --> 10:11:22,480
spaghetti. I'm talking about

5295
10:11:22,480 --> 10:11:24,480
just a little something to like- Oh, I need

5296
10:11:24,480 --> 10:11:27,870
something. A little something.

5297
10:11:27,870 --> 10:11:31,389
Alright, let's finish the bitch. I said

5298
10:11:31,389 --> 10:11:33,389
it's a full meal for a fucking child.

5299
10:11:33,389 --> 10:11:35,389
Okay, it's a full meal for a child. It is.

5300
10:11:35,389 --> 10:11:37,389
It's not- Alright, whatever. I lied.

5301
10:11:37,389 --> 10:11:49,680
I got it wrong. It's a full meal

5302
10:11:49,680 --> 10:11:51,680
for you. You lied. Stop

5303
10:11:51,680 --> 10:11:56,739
lying, you-

5304
10:11:56,739 --> 10:11:58,739
It's perfect for me. It just is. Alright, we're gonna

5305
10:11:58,739 --> 10:12:00,739
move on from this. You give

5306
10:12:00,739 --> 10:12:02,739
some secrets. You know, I gotta start

5307
10:12:02,739 --> 10:12:04,739
holding on to my secrets.

5308
10:12:04,739 --> 10:12:06,739
I can't tell everybody my secrets now.

5309
10:12:06,739 --> 10:12:08,739
Because then they'll- I mean, I gotta- These are my secrets.

5310
10:12:08,739 --> 10:12:10,739
What do you think I do when I go downstairs?

5311
10:12:10,739 --> 10:12:13,419
I go-

5312
10:12:13,419 --> 10:12:15,419
drink a glass of water and I shake around

5313
10:12:15,419 --> 10:12:17,419
a little. I like shake my body.

5314
10:12:17,419 --> 10:12:19,419
I move my back up and down. I do some stretches

5315
10:12:19,419 --> 10:12:21,419
for my costochondritis and I come back upstairs.

5316
10:12:21,419 --> 10:12:26,540
Call me weird, that's fine.

5317
10:12:26,540 --> 10:12:30,000
It's been 10 hours.

5318
10:12:30,000 --> 10:12:32,620
And I'm- I'm good. A little tired.

5319
10:12:32,620 --> 10:12:34,620
A little cranky. I'm good.

5320
10:12:34,620 --> 10:12:36,620
Maybe need a little nap. Might need a

5321
10:12:36,620 --> 10:12:39,120
bubble later, but I'm good.

5322
10:12:39,120 --> 10:12:41,120
Hey, Appleship, thanks for 250.

5323
10:12:41,120 --> 10:12:46,290
Appreciate it. Uh, yo, have you heard

5324
10:12:46,290 --> 10:12:48,290
the new Gorillaz song? I have not.

5325
10:12:48,290 --> 10:12:50,290
Something I will do immediately when

5326
10:12:50,290 --> 10:12:55,470
turning this off. It slaps.

5327
10:12:55,470 --> 10:12:58,739
I'll have to hear it. Dark Soul,

5328
10:12:58,739 --> 10:13:00,739
thanks for the 250. Gap Gaming

5329
10:13:00,739 --> 10:13:02,739
here to let you know this is a fake funny

5330
10:13:02,739 --> 10:13:04,739
ad, just to let everybody know this is not real.

5331
10:13:04,739 --> 10:13:06,739
Uh, Gap Gaming here to let you gappers know

5332
10:13:06,739 --> 10:13:08,739
we think this stream is pretty rad.

5333
10:13:08,739 --> 10:13:10,739
That's why we're gonna step

5334
10:13:10,739 --> 10:13:12,739
it up and donate these 250 bits so we can

5335
10:13:12,739 --> 10:13:14,739
scoop some totally epic gear from our store.

5336
10:13:14,739 --> 10:13:16,739
Oh, I got some- I have baby burps

5337
10:13:16,739 --> 10:13:18,739
coming. Use code

5338
10:13:18,739 --> 10:13:20,739
BAMTHEMAN for 20% off your next order

5339
10:13:20,739 --> 10:13:26,559
of knee pads. What does everybody

5340
10:13:26,559 --> 10:13:28,989
say? Everybody said something funny in here.

5341
10:13:28,989 --> 10:13:34,110
What did they say? I see people

5342
10:13:34,110 --> 10:13:36,110
tagging somebody. They said something funny. What did they

5343
10:13:36,110 --> 10:13:44,430
say? That was heavy info

5344
10:13:44,430 --> 10:13:46,860
to drop on us. The baby

5345
10:13:46,860 --> 10:13:50,449
thing? Holy shit, 20

5346
10:13:50,449 --> 10:13:52,449
pouches is only $10.

5347
10:13:52,449 --> 10:13:55,650
Somebody's figuring this out

5348
10:13:55,650 --> 10:13:57,650
in real time, and

5349
10:13:57,650 --> 10:14:01,809
I'm so glad that they are.

5350
10:14:01,809 --> 10:14:03,809
Somebody is figuring this all out,

5351
10:14:03,809 --> 10:14:05,809
and I'm just so happy. You know when you just

5352
10:14:05,809 --> 10:14:07,809
know you're right and you have a secret

5353
10:14:07,809 --> 10:14:09,809
and you just know what you're saying

5354
10:14:09,809 --> 10:14:11,809
is correct and nobody believes you?

5355
10:14:11,809 --> 10:14:20,769
That's not a good value.

5356
10:14:20,769 --> 10:14:22,769
Jar of applesauce is like $3.

5357
10:14:22,769 --> 10:14:24,769
This is not a jar of applesauce. This is apples,

5358
10:14:24,769 --> 10:14:26,769
bananas,

5359
10:14:26,769 --> 10:14:28,769
and lemon juice. It gives you a little

5360
10:14:28,769 --> 10:14:30,769
kick. You don't have that in regular applesauce.

5361
10:14:30,769 --> 10:14:44,139
What about granola bars? Those are

5362
10:14:44,139 --> 10:14:47,919
great too. You just pick the thing

5363
10:14:47,919 --> 10:14:49,919
that you like. And I like go-go squeezers,

5364
10:14:49,919 --> 10:14:51,919
apple, banana, fucking lemon juice,

5365
10:14:51,919 --> 10:14:53,919
little kick. Squeezers!

5366
10:14:53,919 --> 10:14:57,379
The Glare, thanks for 10 community subs.

5367
10:14:57,379 --> 10:14:59,379
Appreciate it.

5368
10:14:59,379 --> 10:15:03,660
Thank you, Fel6 for the 5 community subs.

5369
10:15:03,660 --> 10:15:08,400
Appreciate it. Both of you.

5370
10:15:08,400 --> 10:15:12,110
Back to back there. Oops, thanks

5371
10:15:12,110 --> 10:15:14,110
for 500 bits. For the record. Somebody said

5372
10:15:14,110 --> 10:15:16,739
for the record, Angela

5373
10:15:16,739 --> 10:15:29,919
Anaconda.

5374
10:15:29,919 --> 10:15:34,139
Holy shit. Yeah, this is like

5375
10:15:34,139 --> 10:15:36,139
I... What network

5376
10:15:36,139 --> 10:15:47,790
was this show on?

5377
10:15:47,790 --> 10:15:50,220
Was it on Nickelodeon?

5378
10:15:50,220 --> 10:15:52,220
I distinctly remember seeing this show.

5379
10:15:52,220 --> 10:15:54,220
This show was weird.

5380
10:15:54,220 --> 10:16:01,069
Yeah, it was weird picture,

5381
10:16:01,069 --> 10:16:03,069
real life picture, stop motion

5382
10:16:03,069 --> 10:16:05,069
kind of animation stuff, right?

5383
10:16:05,069 --> 10:16:07,069
They just used

5384
10:16:07,069 --> 10:16:09,069
real photos of people and animated them?

5385
10:16:09,069 --> 10:16:15,919
Yeah, that was a weird show. Yeah.

5386
10:16:15,919 --> 10:16:19,419
Thank you, Hoops.

5387
10:16:19,419 --> 10:16:21,419
Thanks for the 500 bits.

5388
10:16:33,419 --> 10:16:42,900
Drink a better

5389
10:16:42,900 --> 10:16:44,900
beer.

5390
10:16:44,900 --> 10:16:49,500
You guys are gonna fucking kill me.

5391
10:16:49,500 --> 10:16:51,500
I have like my boomer brace

5392
10:16:51,500 --> 10:17:04,940
on.

5393
10:17:13,040 --> 10:17:15,040
Yeah, that was fun because chat loves to antagonize

5394
10:17:15,040 --> 10:17:17,040
and cyber bully you.

5395
10:17:17,040 --> 10:17:19,040
It was meant to be nothing more than a throw away goof

5396
10:17:19,040 --> 10:17:21,040
you happen to notice. That said,

5397
10:17:21,040 --> 10:17:23,040
I'm still sifting through some old streams. What were you

5398
10:17:23,040 --> 10:17:32,449
saying? I'm the guy who

5399
10:17:32,449 --> 10:17:34,449
joked about you snapping on stream.

5400
10:17:34,449 --> 10:17:39,569
Yeah, and then I was like, yo, why is

5401
10:17:39,569 --> 10:17:41,569
that? I said, and what do you think

5402
10:17:41,569 --> 10:17:44,959
that is? I remember that.

5403
10:17:44,959 --> 10:17:52,750
Snapping his fingers.

5404
10:17:52,750 --> 10:17:54,750
Uh oh, he's gonna fucking snap.

5405
10:17:54,750 --> 10:18:06,580
You are fussy.

5406
10:18:06,580 --> 10:18:08,940
That was fun. I especially

5407
10:18:08,940 --> 10:18:10,940
like the part where I couldn't get over the wall.

5408
10:18:10,940 --> 10:18:15,550
When I couldn't get over the wall and everybody was screaming

5409
10:18:15,550 --> 10:18:17,550
mean things

5410
10:18:17,550 --> 10:18:22,099
at me. Everyone get down. He's about

5411
10:18:22,099 --> 10:18:28,500
to snap.

5412
10:18:28,500 --> 10:18:32,209
Baker. We always do that.

5413
10:18:32,209 --> 10:18:35,730
I know. I just

5414
10:18:35,730 --> 10:18:37,970
give it back.

5415
10:18:37,970 --> 10:18:39,970
I can't, I can't jab back.

5416
10:18:39,970 --> 10:18:42,910
I jab back.

5417
10:18:42,910 --> 10:18:44,910
I jab back.

5418
10:18:44,910 --> 10:18:46,910
2020 Jerma jabs back.

5419
10:18:46,910 --> 10:18:53,809
Gotta be careful.

5420
10:18:53,809 --> 10:18:55,809
Hey, 101 dominations thanks for 250.

5421
10:18:55,809 --> 10:18:59,839
With all the money coming in, if we don't see Danny

5422
10:18:59,839 --> 10:19:01,839
DeVito in one of your streams, we're going to explode.

5423
10:19:01,839 --> 10:19:03,839
Jokes aside, love

5424
10:19:03,839 --> 10:19:07,550
your streams. Keep it up.

5425
10:19:07,550 --> 10:19:09,919
I don't know if that will happen,

5426
10:19:09,919 --> 10:19:11,919
but it would be really funny if it did.

5427
10:19:11,919 --> 10:19:15,500
Is Jerma Merc the worst emote?

5428
10:19:15,500 --> 10:19:17,500
No, JermaTV is. Or JermaBald.

5429
10:19:17,500 --> 10:19:19,500
The bald coin one.

5430
10:19:19,500 --> 10:19:22,639
Keith King Crimson, your skater

5431
10:19:22,639 --> 10:19:24,639
looks like Angela Anaconda.

5432
10:19:24,639 --> 10:19:27,139
Thanks for the 250. Yeah, that is

5433
10:19:27,139 --> 10:19:31,040
pretty accurate. Silent Serenity

5434
10:19:31,040 --> 10:19:33,040
thanks for 250, Silent Serenity. Imagine if

5435
10:19:33,040 --> 10:19:35,040
your childhood friend stole your jokes. We got this one already,

5436
10:19:35,040 --> 10:19:37,040
but it's funny. Imagine if your

5437
10:19:37,040 --> 10:19:39,040
childhood friend stole your jokes and got more Twitch

5438
10:19:39,040 --> 10:19:41,040
subs than you. Would you let him win?

5439
10:19:41,040 --> 10:19:44,620
Um, it would be really hard

5440
10:19:44,620 --> 10:19:46,620
to beat that person in a clown off

5441
10:19:46,620 --> 10:19:48,620
because no matter what, that person's

5442
10:19:48,620 --> 10:19:50,620
audience would always see me as the pretender.

5443
10:19:50,620 --> 10:19:54,339
It would just never work.

5444
10:19:54,339 --> 10:20:05,470
I could give documented evidence

5445
10:20:05,470 --> 10:20:07,470
and it would be like, yeah, I know,

5446
10:20:07,470 --> 10:20:11,250
but I'm already subbed

5447
10:20:11,250 --> 10:20:13,419
to this guy, so

5448
10:20:13,419 --> 10:20:15,790
and I like him.

5449
10:20:15,790 --> 10:20:17,790
I don't like you. I don't even know who the fuck

5450
10:20:17,790 --> 10:20:19,790
you are.

5451
10:20:19,790 --> 10:20:21,790
But I'm the funny one. I'm the funny guy.

5452
10:20:21,790 --> 10:20:23,790
Yeah, but are you though?

5453
10:20:23,790 --> 10:20:26,349
I like him. I've been

5454
10:20:26,349 --> 10:20:28,349
watching him for five years.

5455
10:20:28,349 --> 10:20:30,779
He's gonna come in here and

5456
10:20:30,779 --> 10:20:32,779
blow up this whole community like this?

5457
10:20:32,779 --> 10:20:35,540
No. No, maybe I'll

5458
10:20:35,540 --> 10:20:42,449
give you a follow. Jerma sure does

5459
10:20:42,449 --> 10:20:44,449
seem to know how this would all play out.

5460
10:20:44,449 --> 10:20:47,519
That's just human nature, isn't it?

5461
10:20:47,519 --> 10:20:55,010
Carlos Mencio

5462
10:20:55,010 --> 10:20:57,010
stole everybody's jokes and

5463
10:20:57,010 --> 10:20:59,010
he was one of the most popular comedians ever.

5464
10:20:59,010 --> 10:21:01,010
Like, nobody cared.

5465
10:21:01,010 --> 10:21:12,209
God, he existed.

5466
10:21:12,209 --> 10:21:18,029
He immediately became less popular.

5467
10:21:18,029 --> 10:21:20,029
I don't know if it was immediate.

5468
10:21:20,029 --> 10:21:22,660
I think that took a long, that took a while.

5469
10:21:22,660 --> 10:21:24,660
That took a lot longer than I think you remember.

5470
10:21:24,660 --> 10:21:30,480
He still had a bunch of, he still

5471
10:21:30,480 --> 10:21:32,480
had his TV show. He was still touring.

5472
10:21:32,480 --> 10:21:36,900
Joe Rogan made him disappear.

5473
10:21:36,900 --> 10:21:48,739
No, he

5474
10:21:48,739 --> 10:21:55,260
Alright, how many seasons of

5475
10:21:55,260 --> 10:21:57,260
Mind of Mencio were there?

5476
10:21:57,260 --> 10:21:59,260
Mind of Mencio.

5477
10:21:59,260 --> 10:22:03,620
There were four seasons

5478
10:22:03,620 --> 10:22:08,480
of this show. Now, he wasn't around

5479
10:22:08,480 --> 10:22:10,480
for like a year. He was around for like five

5480
10:22:10,480 --> 10:22:13,360
plus years before

5481
10:22:13,360 --> 10:22:15,360
anybody really, really took it

5482
10:22:15,360 --> 10:22:17,360
to him to get rid of like, oh, you were

5483
10:22:17,360 --> 10:22:23,500
a joke stealer.

5484
10:22:23,500 --> 10:22:29,139
Fridl Schlintz

5485
10:22:29,139 --> 10:22:31,139
Thanks for the 250. Please turn the light on in your room.

5486
10:22:31,139 --> 10:22:33,139
You'll ruin your eyes staring at a bright screen in the dark.

5487
10:22:33,139 --> 10:22:35,440
I am in a bright room.

5488
10:22:35,440 --> 10:22:46,769
Goiki gave

5489
10:22:46,769 --> 10:22:48,769
Goiki gave 20 community subs.

5490
10:22:48,769 --> 10:22:51,389
We caught it, but that's a lot of subs.

5491
10:22:51,389 --> 10:22:55,419
Thank you, Goiki.

5492
10:22:55,419 --> 10:23:02,980
Really appreciate that.

5493
10:23:02,980 --> 10:23:04,980
You came out as a baby on this stream.

5494
10:23:04,980 --> 10:23:06,980
Say goodbye to any future sponsorships.

5495
10:23:06,980 --> 10:23:08,980
Unless it's from Gerber's Baby Food.

5496
10:23:08,980 --> 10:23:10,980
Have you ever seen a sponsorship on this stream

5497
10:23:10,980 --> 10:23:12,980
that wasn't a joke?

5498
10:23:12,980 --> 10:23:16,750
Of us pretending there was one?

5499
10:23:16,750 --> 10:23:18,750
Has this stream ever been sponsored once by anything?

5500
10:23:18,750 --> 10:23:20,750
That we're not making a pretend I'm

5501
10:23:20,750 --> 10:23:23,629
sponsored joke?

5502
10:23:23,629 --> 10:23:26,769
I don't think that's going to be an issue for me.

5503
10:23:26,769 --> 10:23:33,419
I think I'll be okay.

5504
10:23:33,419 --> 10:23:37,779
But that being said, Go Go Squeezers

5505
10:23:37,779 --> 10:23:40,080
are the best.

5506
10:23:40,080 --> 10:23:42,080
So is JetBlue. You should fly it every time you fly on an airplane.

5507
10:23:42,080 --> 10:23:46,819
And Ridgewallets

5508
10:23:46,819 --> 10:23:50,080
are good. I like it.

5509
10:23:50,080 --> 10:23:52,080
Out of those three, I mean if you're listening

5510
10:23:52,080 --> 10:23:56,860
I'm here

5511
10:23:56,860 --> 10:23:59,169
I talk. I like to meme and chat.

5512
10:23:59,169 --> 10:24:01,169
We go back. We jab back and forth.

5513
10:24:01,169 --> 10:24:03,169
We have like this little fun banter thing going on.

5514
10:24:03,169 --> 10:24:07,389
They call me short.

5515
10:24:07,389 --> 10:24:09,389
And I like scream at them.

5516
10:24:09,389 --> 10:24:17,970
It's fun. I eat baby food

5517
10:24:17,970 --> 10:24:19,970
in front of them and they call me a weirdo.

5518
10:24:19,970 --> 10:24:26,620
Don't you want to sponsor this stream?

5519
10:24:26,620 --> 10:24:28,620
Don't you want to like give a bunch of money to this stream?

5520
10:24:28,620 --> 10:24:38,540
Why wouldn't you?

5521
10:24:38,540 --> 10:24:40,540
Most impressive babies too.

5522
10:24:40,540 --> 10:24:43,360
Nah, I'm just fucking around. I'm just messing around.

5523
10:24:43,360 --> 10:24:47,580
Don't worry.

5524
10:24:47,580 --> 10:24:49,580
Isaac?

5525
10:24:49,580 --> 10:24:51,580
Isaac, thanks for the 5000

5526
10:24:51,580 --> 10:24:53,580
bits. That stupid fart special

5527
10:24:53,580 --> 10:24:55,580
made me laugh harder than anything else in a long time.

5528
10:24:55,580 --> 10:24:57,580
Thanks for the fun stream. Thanks for watching.

5529
10:24:57,580 --> 10:25:00,980
Thanks for spending time here.

5530
10:25:00,980 --> 10:25:03,279
Thanks for giving me a very large

5531
10:25:03,279 --> 10:25:06,160
amount of money. Glad you got some laughs.

5532
10:25:06,160 --> 10:25:09,300
Thank you.

5533
10:25:09,300 --> 10:25:13,260
Five community subs, Kip. Lazy

5534
10:25:13,260 --> 10:25:15,260
Purple. What's going on Lazy Purple?

5535
10:25:15,260 --> 10:25:17,760
Lazy Purple, you still here? It's late.

5536
10:25:17,760 --> 10:25:19,760
Last second bits because that was honestly the funniest

5537
10:25:19,760 --> 10:25:21,760
stream I ever caught. Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate that you pushed

5538
10:25:21,760 --> 10:25:24,639
through and beat it. Thanks a lot, dude.

5539
10:25:24,639 --> 10:25:29,889
You are still here.

5540
10:25:29,889 --> 10:25:36,669
I should probably do this.

5541
10:25:36,669 --> 10:25:42,750
You got

5542
10:25:42,750 --> 10:25:44,750
VIP. Let's go.

5543
10:25:44,750 --> 10:25:46,750
Newest VIP. Lazy Purple.

5544
10:25:46,750 --> 10:25:56,139
Bane?

5545
10:25:56,139 --> 10:25:58,139
Lazy Purple is an old YouTuber.

5546
10:25:58,139 --> 10:26:00,769
Made a lot of TF2 content.

5547
10:26:00,769 --> 10:26:02,769
Funny guy.

5548
10:26:02,769 --> 10:26:11,339
Well, I used the term old because

5549
10:26:11,339 --> 10:26:14,610
we're talking like

5550
10:26:14,610 --> 10:26:20,940
six, seven, eight years ago.

5551
10:26:20,940 --> 10:26:22,940
He still does.

5552
10:26:22,940 --> 10:26:24,940
I'm just saying he's an old

5553
10:26:24,940 --> 10:26:27,250
YouTube. He didn't start his YouTube channel

5554
10:26:27,250 --> 10:26:29,250
three days ago. He's been around for a long

5555
10:26:29,250 --> 10:26:31,739
time. He's an old YouTuber.

5556
10:26:31,739 --> 10:26:33,739
He's an old TF2 YouTuber.

5557
10:26:33,739 --> 10:26:40,779
That's accurate.

5558
10:26:40,779 --> 10:26:42,779
Lazy Purple was making videos I think before I was.

5559
10:26:42,779 --> 10:26:45,220
Like in 2010 or something.

5560
10:26:45,220 --> 10:26:47,220
When did you start your channel?

5561
10:26:47,220 --> 10:26:49,459
2011? 2012?

5562
10:26:49,459 --> 10:26:56,419
Something like that.

5563
10:26:56,419 --> 10:27:00,900
That's a good question.

5564
10:27:00,900 --> 10:27:03,580
Oh, yeah. You really are

5565
10:27:03,580 --> 10:27:07,040
a baby. July

5566
10:27:07,040 --> 10:27:09,040
21st, 2010.

5567
10:27:09,040 --> 10:27:11,540
That's a year before I started

5568
10:27:11,540 --> 10:27:14,860
YouTube. So, yeah.

5569
10:27:14,860 --> 10:27:16,860
You've been around a long time.

5570
10:27:16,860 --> 10:27:21,900
Thanks for watching. Glad to have you.

5571
10:27:21,900 --> 10:27:24,849
Five community subs

5572
10:27:24,849 --> 10:27:26,849
from Chef SCT. Thanks for the

5573
10:27:26,849 --> 10:27:28,849
five subs. Aw, futz. Thanks for the

5574
10:27:28,849 --> 10:27:32,239
$11.

5575
10:27:32,239 --> 10:27:34,239
Hi, Jermis. I want to say thanks for everything.

5576
10:27:34,239 --> 10:27:36,239
Past year has been one of the hardest years of my

5577
10:27:36,239 --> 10:27:38,239
life. And the main thing keeping me afloat

5578
10:27:38,239 --> 10:27:40,239
and positive are your streams and the chat.

5579
10:27:40,239 --> 10:27:42,239
Hi, chat. Thank you

5580
10:27:42,239 --> 10:27:44,239
so much for everything and a fantastic stream tonight. Have

5581
10:27:44,239 --> 10:27:46,239
a great rest of your night. You as

5582
10:27:46,239 --> 10:27:49,500
well. We've got a fun group of

5583
10:27:49,500 --> 10:27:55,010
people here. This community is one of the

5584
10:27:55,010 --> 10:28:02,050
best. At its very core,

5585
10:28:02,050 --> 10:28:04,050
there's a lot of really, really,

5586
10:28:04,050 --> 10:28:09,550
really great people here.

5587
10:28:09,550 --> 10:28:11,550
The channel has grown

5588
10:28:11,550 --> 10:28:13,550
so much in the last two years.

5589
10:28:13,550 --> 10:28:15,919
I'm surprised it still can

5590
10:28:15,919 --> 10:28:17,919
stay kind of like this.

5591
10:28:17,919 --> 10:28:21,889
Once a channel

5592
10:28:21,889 --> 10:28:23,889
typically, I mean,

5593
10:28:23,889 --> 10:28:25,889
we've seen the kind of the growth

5594
10:28:25,889 --> 10:28:27,889
of a bunch of new people that are coming

5595
10:28:27,889 --> 10:28:29,889
in and just the chat

5596
10:28:29,889 --> 10:28:31,889
goes much faster. It's

5597
10:28:31,889 --> 10:28:33,889
harder to pay attention to what people are saying.

5598
10:28:33,889 --> 10:28:35,889
I mean, there's typically

5599
10:28:35,889 --> 10:28:37,889
nowadays there's

5600
10:28:37,889 --> 10:28:39,889
four to six thousand

5601
10:28:39,889 --> 10:28:41,889
concurrent viewers on this stream.

5602
10:28:41,889 --> 10:28:46,180
Even a year or two ago, there was like

5603
10:28:46,180 --> 10:28:48,180
two thousand, maybe.

5604
10:28:48,180 --> 10:28:50,180
Two years ago, this

5605
10:28:50,180 --> 10:28:52,180
stream was at like eighteen hundred

5606
10:28:52,180 --> 10:28:54,180
to like twenty five hundred concurrent.

5607
10:28:54,180 --> 10:28:57,309
We've grown like three times

5608
10:28:57,309 --> 10:28:59,309
the audience in a year

5609
10:28:59,309 --> 10:29:03,339
and a half. But even still, it

5610
10:29:03,339 --> 10:29:06,739
still is, it's

5611
10:29:06,739 --> 10:29:10,260
still fun. It's not getting

5612
10:29:10,260 --> 10:29:12,260
corrupted. Not that it would

5613
10:29:12,260 --> 10:29:14,260
for really any reason, but

5614
10:29:14,260 --> 10:29:21,300
he's viewbotting.

5615
10:29:21,300 --> 10:29:27,819
Why would I ever do that?

5616
10:29:27,819 --> 10:29:34,029
And yeah, we've had some

5617
10:29:34,029 --> 10:29:36,029
growing pains on this channel.

5618
10:29:36,029 --> 10:29:38,029
Nothing anything major, but anytime

5619
10:29:38,029 --> 10:29:40,029
any channel grows this

5620
10:29:40,029 --> 10:29:42,269
quickly, you know, even for me,

5621
10:29:42,269 --> 10:29:44,269
like I'm trying to find

5622
10:29:44,269 --> 10:29:46,269
ways to moderate the channel better,

5623
10:29:46,269 --> 10:29:50,110
figure out how to

5624
10:29:50,110 --> 10:29:52,110
have a community this large and what to do,

5625
10:29:52,110 --> 10:29:54,110
how to be fair.

5626
10:29:54,110 --> 10:29:56,110
We've seen like the bit minimum

5627
10:29:56,110 --> 10:29:58,110
increase, right? Like that's something

5628
10:29:58,110 --> 10:30:00,110
I didn't really want to do, but I did.

5629
10:30:00,110 --> 10:30:02,669
All this stuff

5630
10:30:02,669 --> 10:30:04,669
has kind of only happened within the last two

5631
10:30:04,669 --> 10:30:10,930
years, but I still

5632
10:30:10,930 --> 10:30:12,930
love it. I'm still having a great time.

5633
10:30:12,930 --> 10:30:14,930
I'm glad there's people here that enjoy it too.

5634
10:30:14,930 --> 10:30:22,930
I worry about the implications

5635
10:30:22,930 --> 10:30:24,930
behind gifted subs. What do you mean?

5636
10:30:24,930 --> 10:30:27,809
Implications behind gifted subs?

5637
10:30:27,809 --> 10:30:31,459
Like people, there's a

5638
10:30:31,459 --> 10:30:33,459
lot of gifted subs and they'll

5639
10:30:33,459 --> 10:30:41,580
what do you mean? Trolls become

5640
10:30:41,580 --> 10:30:46,699
subs. Yeah, but that's

5641
10:30:46,699 --> 10:30:48,699
most people that are coming here, they're

5642
10:30:48,699 --> 10:30:50,699
just fucking around. They're not

5643
10:30:50,699 --> 10:30:54,220
I don't think of maybe

5644
10:30:54,220 --> 10:30:56,220
a few times in

5645
10:30:56,220 --> 10:30:58,220
five years on Twitch

5646
10:30:58,220 --> 10:31:00,220
have I really thought that there was a problem

5647
10:31:00,220 --> 10:31:02,220
in the chat, like a real one.

5648
10:31:02,220 --> 10:31:04,459
Not something that could be, you know,

5649
10:31:04,459 --> 10:31:06,459
fixed with a spam filter or

5650
10:31:06,459 --> 10:31:10,050
I don't think, it's been a while

5651
10:31:10,050 --> 10:31:12,050
since I think that there's been a

5652
10:31:12,050 --> 10:31:14,050
real, I've had it like, let me just put it

5653
10:31:14,050 --> 10:31:16,050
this way. I'm not sure there's been

5654
10:31:16,050 --> 10:31:18,050
a point where I've had a real

5655
10:31:18,050 --> 10:31:20,050
problem with something going on in chat.

5656
10:31:20,050 --> 10:31:22,050
Like a real problem with somebody

5657
10:31:22,050 --> 10:31:24,050
or

5658
10:31:24,050 --> 10:31:26,480
I don't, that just doesn't really happen

5659
10:31:26,480 --> 10:31:39,339
that often here. What were the problems?

5660
10:31:46,459 --> 10:31:48,459
Sometimes the channel, sometimes it can get a little

5661
10:31:48,459 --> 10:31:50,459
out of control with, somebody will come

5662
10:31:50,459 --> 10:31:52,459
in and say something

5663
10:31:52,459 --> 10:31:54,459
really, really fucked up, whether it's something

5664
10:31:54,459 --> 10:31:56,459
just ridiculously

5665
10:31:56,459 --> 10:31:58,459
offensive, racist

5666
10:31:58,459 --> 10:32:00,459
shit. Somebody will just drop a bunch

5667
10:32:00,459 --> 10:32:02,459
of terrible shit and it's like, okay, we gotta

5668
10:32:02,459 --> 10:32:06,690
deal with this. Sometimes

5669
10:32:06,690 --> 10:32:08,690
the spam can get a little

5670
10:32:08,690 --> 10:32:12,459
out of control. But that's

5671
10:32:12,459 --> 10:32:14,459
not that big of a deal because

5672
10:32:14,459 --> 10:32:16,459
it's easily correctable.

5673
10:32:16,459 --> 10:32:26,129
But this community,

5674
10:32:26,129 --> 10:32:28,129
they all, you guys all

5675
10:32:28,129 --> 10:32:30,129
think usually the same things

5676
10:32:30,129 --> 10:32:32,129
are interesting

5677
10:32:32,129 --> 10:32:34,129
or funny or

5678
10:32:34,129 --> 10:32:36,819
there's not a whole lot of split

5679
10:32:36,819 --> 10:32:38,819
up groups of people in this community

5680
10:32:38,819 --> 10:32:40,819
that don't like each other or don't

5681
10:32:40,819 --> 10:32:42,819
agree with each other or think, you know what I mean?

5682
10:32:42,819 --> 10:32:44,819
There's not that many people.

5683
10:32:44,819 --> 10:32:48,339
Well, the Dru crew is less

5684
10:32:48,339 --> 10:32:57,809
than a hundred people. I should do a poll

5685
10:32:57,809 --> 10:33:00,110
one day.

5686
10:33:00,110 --> 10:33:02,110
He still thinks that.

5687
10:33:02,110 --> 10:33:04,110
Don't you see the long game

5688
10:33:04,110 --> 10:33:06,110
I'm playing here, guys?

5689
10:33:06,110 --> 10:33:08,589
Come on.

5690
10:33:08,589 --> 10:33:10,589
This is some serious

5691
10:33:10,589 --> 10:33:12,589
6,000 go go squeeze brain

5692
10:33:12,589 --> 10:33:14,589
IQ

5693
10:33:14,589 --> 10:33:20,739
long play. This is a long

5694
10:33:20,739 --> 10:33:23,680
con because the more

5695
10:33:23,680 --> 10:33:25,680
the more that we talk

5696
10:33:25,680 --> 10:33:27,680
about, oh, there's not that many people

5697
10:33:27,680 --> 10:33:29,680
in the Dru crew.

5698
10:33:29,680 --> 10:33:31,680
No, of course not.

5699
10:33:31,680 --> 10:33:33,680
No, there's like 10 people in it.

5700
10:33:33,680 --> 10:33:35,680
They get members and

5701
10:33:35,680 --> 10:33:38,300
they get members and then I can

5702
10:33:38,300 --> 10:33:40,300
stream Nancy Drew

5703
10:33:40,300 --> 10:33:42,300
whenever I want

5704
10:33:42,300 --> 10:33:44,739
because all of you will be in

5705
10:33:44,739 --> 10:33:47,099
the Dru crew and I can

5706
10:33:47,099 --> 10:33:49,099
stream the 250 game

5707
10:33:49,099 --> 10:33:51,099
catalog and everyone

5708
10:33:51,099 --> 10:33:59,809
will be for it. Oh, no,

5709
10:33:59,809 --> 10:34:01,809
not my master plan.

5710
10:34:01,809 --> 10:34:08,849
I'm not even sure there is that many Nancy Drew games.

5711
10:34:08,849 --> 10:34:10,849
You're a megalomaniac. You psycho.

5712
10:34:10,849 --> 10:34:13,980
You monster.

5713
10:34:13,980 --> 10:34:15,980
No, I love the Dru crew.

5714
10:34:15,980 --> 10:34:17,980
Their enthusiasm is encouraging.

5715
10:34:17,980 --> 10:34:20,540
Makes me happy.

5716
10:34:20,540 --> 10:34:26,419
It really does.

5717
10:34:26,419 --> 10:34:33,389
Play this like a fiddle.

5718
10:34:33,389 --> 10:34:35,389
We love you. Watching you play Diablo

5719
10:34:35,389 --> 10:34:37,389
is my favorite.

5720
10:34:37,389 --> 10:34:39,389
Outer Wilds was the second.

5721
10:34:39,389 --> 10:34:41,389
I mean, we're playing Diablo 2 tomorrow.

5722
10:34:41,389 --> 10:34:43,389
Get ready. Tomorrow's stream, by the way, is going to be

5723
10:34:43,389 --> 10:34:47,940
very, very laid back.

5724
10:34:47,940 --> 10:34:49,940
We're just going to

5725
10:34:49,940 --> 10:34:51,940
I say that, but I'm probably going to be really tense

5726
10:34:51,940 --> 10:34:53,940
trying to fight Diablo.

5727
10:34:53,940 --> 10:34:55,940
Ah, another battery fell.

5728
10:34:55,940 --> 10:34:58,879
Why am I covered in batteries?

5729
10:34:58,879 --> 10:35:01,379
Yeah, it's going to be just chill tomorrow.

5730
10:35:01,379 --> 10:35:03,379
If I beat Diablo and

5731
10:35:03,379 --> 10:35:06,059
or if I die

5732
10:35:06,059 --> 10:35:08,059
let's say I die

5733
10:35:08,059 --> 10:35:10,059
at some point during that stream.

5734
10:35:10,059 --> 10:35:12,059
I'm going to try not to, but it's pretty possible.

5735
10:35:12,059 --> 10:35:14,059
Especially Act 5 is going to be hard.

5736
10:35:14,059 --> 10:35:17,069
We'll just do Asura's Wrath DLC.

5737
10:35:17,069 --> 10:35:19,069
Like if the D2 segment

5738
10:35:19,069 --> 10:35:21,069
if I cannot beat Act 5

5739
10:35:21,069 --> 10:35:23,629
then, you know,

5740
10:35:23,629 --> 10:35:25,629
if two or three hours have gone by, we'll just do Asura's Wrath.

5741
10:35:25,629 --> 10:35:33,040
We'll see.

5742
10:35:33,040 --> 10:35:35,040
Let's get the credits rolling.

5743
10:35:35,040 --> 10:35:37,040
Roll those credits.

5744
10:35:37,040 --> 10:35:40,300
Thanks for sticking around, guys.

5745
10:35:40,300 --> 10:35:44,459
Thanks for another long one.

5746
10:35:44,459 --> 10:35:46,459
Ten and a half, ten and a half, ten and a half,

5747
10:35:46,459 --> 10:35:48,459
ten and a half, something like that.

5748
10:35:48,459 --> 10:35:58,559
Almost eleven, almost.

5749
10:35:58,559 --> 10:36:00,559
We were talking about that earlier.

5750
10:36:00,559 --> 10:36:02,559
About how something goes, say, in like sixty, seventy hour weeks.

5751
10:36:02,559 --> 10:36:07,550
That's so tough.

5752
10:36:07,550 --> 10:36:09,550
That's so much time.

5753
10:36:09,550 --> 10:36:12,300
I really hope you're either making good money

5754
10:36:12,300 --> 10:36:18,190
or you're making progress, you know?

5755
10:36:18,190 --> 10:36:23,949
Here come the credits.

5756
10:36:23,949 --> 10:36:25,949
Seventy hours.

5757
10:36:25,949 --> 10:36:27,949
We're talking about like five twelve hour days

5758
10:36:27,949 --> 10:36:29,949
or something, like six twelve,

5759
10:36:29,949 --> 10:36:35,139
ten twelve hour days.

5760
10:36:35,139 --> 10:36:37,139
Rarely worth it to work that much.

5761
10:36:37,139 --> 10:36:40,339
Just take care of yourselves.

5762
10:36:40,339 --> 10:36:42,339
If you really are working that much more than like fifty plus hours a week,

5763
10:36:42,339 --> 10:36:44,339
sixty hours a week,

5764
10:36:44,339 --> 10:36:53,099
I really hope you're taking care of yourself.

5765
10:36:53,099 --> 10:36:55,099
That's what it takes to get through residency.

5766
10:36:55,099 --> 10:36:58,500
Yeah, nobody should work that much.

5767
10:36:58,500 --> 10:37:01,489
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

5768
10:37:01,489 --> 10:37:03,489
It really is unfortunate.

5769
10:37:03,489 --> 10:37:08,989
Sometimes it's not a choice.

5770
10:37:08,989 --> 10:37:15,709
If you like working that much,

5771
10:37:15,709 --> 10:37:17,709
yeah, then, I mean,

5772
10:37:17,709 --> 10:37:19,709
some people really love to stay busy

5773
10:37:19,709 --> 10:37:21,949
and doing their job or their work

5774
10:37:21,949 --> 10:37:23,949
is very fulfilling and they love it.

5775
10:37:23,949 --> 10:37:25,949
Yeah, absolutely.

5776
10:37:25,949 --> 10:37:27,949
But even still, like, that's a lot.

5777
10:37:27,949 --> 10:37:30,319
Sixty hours,

5778
10:37:30,319 --> 10:37:32,319
seventy hours a week for a job.

5779
10:37:32,319 --> 10:37:35,900
Because you can start to burn out.

5780
10:37:35,900 --> 10:37:37,900
You can burn out like the sun.

5781
10:37:37,900 --> 10:37:48,980
Like I told you back when I was

5782
10:37:48,980 --> 10:37:50,980
working before

5783
10:37:50,980 --> 10:37:52,980
YouTube or Twitter or anything,

5784
10:37:52,980 --> 10:37:54,980
you know, when I was working

5785
10:37:54,980 --> 10:37:56,980
full time, it was

5786
10:37:56,980 --> 10:37:59,599
thirty, thirty five, forty,

5787
10:37:59,599 --> 10:38:01,599
maybe max, like thirty five.

5788
10:38:01,599 --> 10:38:04,739
Even then, I can't imagine

5789
10:38:04,739 --> 10:38:07,230
doubling that shit.

5790
10:38:07,230 --> 10:38:14,459
That's a lot of time.

5791
10:38:14,459 --> 10:38:16,459
I thought he showed that after four weeks, sixty hours

5792
10:38:16,459 --> 10:38:18,459
a week becomes as productive

5793
10:38:18,459 --> 10:38:20,459
as forty hour weeks.

5794
10:38:20,459 --> 10:38:22,459
It's stupid to work people like that.

5795
10:38:22,459 --> 10:38:24,459
Yeah, there's a lot of

5796
10:38:24,459 --> 10:38:26,459
research out there about

5797
10:38:26,459 --> 10:38:28,639
shorter. And I'm a proponent

5798
10:38:28,639 --> 10:38:30,879
of this as well.

5799
10:38:30,879 --> 10:38:32,879
You are more productive

5800
10:38:32,879 --> 10:38:34,879
the less you work.

5801
10:38:34,879 --> 10:38:39,099
Working three or four

5802
10:38:39,099 --> 10:38:41,099
eight hour days

5803
10:38:41,099 --> 10:38:43,099
is more productive than working

5804
10:38:43,099 --> 10:38:45,099
seven six hour days, seven five hour

5805
10:38:45,099 --> 10:39:00,339
days in a row. Because

5806
10:39:00,339 --> 10:39:02,339
this is how I feel as well. I mean, this is

5807
10:39:02,339 --> 10:39:04,339
getting a little existential here, I think.

5808
10:39:04,339 --> 10:39:07,019
But if somebody

5809
10:39:07,019 --> 10:39:10,220
is happy and they have

5810
10:39:10,220 --> 10:39:12,220
time to spend,

5811
10:39:12,220 --> 10:39:14,720
don't you think that they would do a better job?

5812
10:39:14,720 --> 10:39:17,279
Right? Don't you think that

5813
10:39:17,279 --> 10:39:19,279
they would do a better job if

5814
10:39:19,279 --> 10:39:21,279
they had three days off,

5815
10:39:21,279 --> 10:39:24,739
four days off a week?

5816
10:39:24,739 --> 10:39:26,739
Going to work and they would be like, alright, like

5817
10:39:26,739 --> 10:39:28,739
I'm ready, like

5818
10:39:28,739 --> 10:39:32,190
I'm ready to go. I'm a huge

5819
10:39:32,190 --> 10:39:34,190
proponent of productivity

5820
10:39:34,190 --> 10:39:36,190
versus time.

5821
10:39:36,190 --> 10:39:39,139
Effective use of time

5822
10:39:39,139 --> 10:39:41,139
rather than hours of time.

5823
10:39:41,139 --> 10:39:48,110
There are tons of studies that

5824
10:39:48,110 --> 10:39:50,110
confirm this. Yeah,

5825
10:39:50,110 --> 10:39:52,110
it's really true. I wish we would

5826
10:39:52,110 --> 10:39:54,110
pull back to like a four

5827
10:39:54,110 --> 10:39:56,110
day work week. We'd do so much

5828
10:39:56,110 --> 10:39:58,110
good for so many people.

5829
10:39:58,110 --> 10:40:00,110
We wouldn't even lose out on anything.

5830
10:40:00,110 --> 10:40:09,970
Ow! Oh, that hurt.

5831
10:40:09,970 --> 10:40:12,849
That actually hurt.

5832
10:40:12,849 --> 10:40:16,620
Oh! My mic just

5833
10:40:16,620 --> 10:40:18,620
why did, what the fuck? Hold on.

5834
10:40:18,620 --> 10:40:20,989
My mic just like unscrewed.

5835
10:40:20,989 --> 10:40:30,660
My mic just unscrewed

5836
10:40:30,660 --> 10:40:32,660
and I like tried, it was like gonna fall.

5837
10:40:32,660 --> 10:40:34,900
It was like loose or something.

5838
10:40:34,900 --> 10:40:36,900
I just like stubbed my fingernail.

5839
10:40:36,900 --> 10:40:40,290
Oh, the retch are

5840
10:40:40,290 --> 10:40:42,779
cutting his mic.

5841
10:40:42,779 --> 10:40:44,779
I don't even think it's about money though. Like you can

5842
10:40:44,779 --> 10:40:47,279
if you're more productive, you'll make

5843
10:40:47,279 --> 10:40:49,279
more money. If your workers are more

5844
10:40:49,279 --> 10:40:51,279
productive, you're gonna make more money.

5845
10:40:51,279 --> 10:40:53,279
If your workers like what they do for work

5846
10:40:53,279 --> 10:40:55,279
and they enjoy coming into work, they're gonna

5847
10:40:55,279 --> 10:40:57,459
do more work when you

5848
10:40:57,459 --> 10:41:03,279
ask them to. If I ever had

5849
10:41:03,279 --> 10:41:05,279
a company, like a real company

5850
10:41:05,279 --> 10:41:07,279
not like, oh, German 95, the

5851
10:41:07,279 --> 10:41:09,279
E-Clown dickhead. If I had a

5852
10:41:09,279 --> 10:41:11,279
real company with

5853
10:41:11,279 --> 10:41:13,279
like 50 employees or something,

5854
10:41:13,279 --> 10:41:15,279
none of you motherfuckers is working

5855
10:41:15,279 --> 10:41:21,940
more than four days a week. Like under

5856
10:41:21,940 --> 10:41:23,940
any circumstance. Unless of

5857
10:41:23,940 --> 10:41:27,260
course, if you

5858
10:41:27,260 --> 10:41:29,260
wanted to, like let's say you were like

5859
10:41:29,260 --> 10:41:31,260
can I get some more hours? I really, I'm

5860
10:41:31,260 --> 10:41:33,260
ready to go. I want to go like all, I want to go all

5861
10:41:33,260 --> 10:41:35,260
this week. Alright.

5862
10:41:35,260 --> 10:41:42,690
You got it. Let's go.

5863
10:41:42,690 --> 10:41:44,690
God, please hire me.

5864
10:41:44,690 --> 10:41:53,459
It'd be nice to like just run a big

5865
10:41:53,459 --> 10:41:55,459
company and have tons of money

5866
10:41:55,459 --> 10:41:57,459
and have a bunch of employees and

5867
10:41:57,459 --> 10:41:59,949
I would love to have like birthday parties

5868
10:41:59,949 --> 10:42:01,949
for people. Is it weird

5869
10:42:01,949 --> 10:42:03,949
that I think about this stuff? I would love to be like

5870
10:42:03,949 --> 10:42:05,949
the CEO and like have like a surprise

5871
10:42:05,949 --> 10:42:07,949
birthday party for

5872
10:42:07,949 --> 10:42:09,949
workers.

5873
10:42:09,949 --> 10:42:13,980
That would be so much fun.

5874
10:42:13,980 --> 10:42:17,440
And we'd bring like games in and stuff.

5875
10:42:17,440 --> 10:42:26,779
You'd be Michael from the office.

5876
10:42:36,180 --> 10:42:38,860
Gamer boss.

5877
10:42:38,860 --> 10:42:42,639
It would be that I, because

5878
10:42:42,639 --> 10:42:44,639
if you're happy and you

5879
10:42:44,639 --> 10:42:46,639
like where you work, then you're

5880
10:42:46,639 --> 10:42:48,639
going to want to work better

5881
10:42:48,639 --> 10:42:51,199
and harder. Not

5882
10:42:51,199 --> 10:42:53,199
work smarter, not harder.

5883
10:42:53,199 --> 10:42:55,199
Work smarter, not harder.

5884
10:42:55,199 --> 10:42:57,199
It's such a simple concept.

5885
10:42:57,199 --> 10:42:59,199
How is it so boring to so many

5886
10:42:59,199 --> 10:43:01,199
people that run companies?

5887
10:43:01,199 --> 10:43:15,339
But what about that

5888
10:43:15,339 --> 10:43:17,339
fifth and sixth day?

5889
10:43:17,339 --> 10:43:19,339
We're going to lose profits. No, you won't.

5890
10:43:19,339 --> 10:43:21,339
No, you won't. You'll make more money.

5891
10:43:21,339 --> 10:43:24,099
You'll make more money. I bet you you'll

5892
10:43:24,099 --> 10:43:26,099
make more money.

5893
10:43:26,099 --> 10:43:28,099
More money, you say? Yes, a lot

5894
10:43:28,099 --> 10:43:32,959
more money.

5895
10:43:32,959 --> 10:43:35,260
Maybe I'll think about this

5896
10:43:35,260 --> 10:43:37,260
all day work week.

5897
10:43:37,260 --> 10:43:39,260
More money, he said

5898
10:43:39,260 --> 10:43:41,260
more money, therefore I should probably do

5899
10:43:41,260 --> 10:43:48,879
it.

5900
10:43:48,879 --> 10:43:53,040
Make a company as a funny

5901
10:43:53,040 --> 10:43:55,040
bit. I would just go bankrupt.

5902
10:43:55,040 --> 10:43:57,040
I don't have the capital

5903
10:43:57,040 --> 10:44:01,389
to be able to rob

5904
10:44:01,389 --> 10:44:04,779
a bank. Come on, it's like midnight

5905
10:44:04,779 --> 10:44:10,029
man. But let's finish

5906
10:44:10,029 --> 10:44:12,029
the bits. I could go off on a tangent

5907
10:44:12,029 --> 10:44:14,029
of how work

5908
10:44:14,029 --> 10:44:16,029
productivity is more important

5909
10:44:16,029 --> 10:44:18,029
than numbers at the job

5910
10:44:18,029 --> 10:44:20,029
all day.

5911
10:44:20,029 --> 10:44:22,029
You give me like two fingers of whiskey

5912
10:44:22,029 --> 10:44:24,029
and sit me down.

5913
10:44:24,029 --> 10:44:26,029
I could talk to you about this for like

5914
10:44:26,029 --> 10:44:36,910
three hours.

5915
10:44:36,910 --> 10:44:40,050
Hey, the

5916
10:44:40,050 --> 10:44:43,309
point. Thanks for the

5917
10:44:43,309 --> 10:44:45,309
300 bits. Hey, German back. LOL, by the

5918
10:44:45,309 --> 10:44:47,309
way, these are a rare

5919
10:44:47,309 --> 10:44:49,309
those are

5920
10:44:49,309 --> 10:44:51,309
nevermind. Those are great. I eat

5921
10:44:51,309 --> 10:44:53,309
organic applesauce, squeeze things as a filler

5922
10:44:53,309 --> 10:44:55,309
too sometimes. They're fun, but also a lot

5923
10:44:55,309 --> 10:44:57,489
of plastic waste.

5924
10:44:57,489 --> 10:44:59,489
Anyways, I'm getting interested in what you

5925
10:44:59,489 --> 10:45:01,489
do. What do you listen to in music?

5926
10:45:01,489 --> 10:45:03,489
I really like Rush, to be honest.

5927
10:45:03,489 --> 10:45:05,489
You have like a top 10 bands

5928
10:45:05,489 --> 10:45:07,489
you listen to. Gorillaz?

5929
10:45:07,489 --> 10:45:09,489
Gorillaz? Gorillaz?

5930
10:45:09,489 --> 10:45:11,660
Whatever video game soundtrack

5931
10:45:11,660 --> 10:45:13,660
I think is interesting

5932
10:45:13,660 --> 10:45:15,660
at the time. Gorillaz?

5933
10:45:15,660 --> 10:45:18,610
Repeat the same

5934
10:45:18,610 --> 10:45:20,610
three anime intros 200

5935
10:45:20,610 --> 10:45:22,610
times each until I don't care anymore.

5936
10:45:22,610 --> 10:45:25,620
Gorillaz?

5937
10:45:25,620 --> 10:45:29,580
And

5938
10:45:29,580 --> 10:45:47,620
Mozart. I know, that's a

5939
10:45:47,620 --> 10:45:50,940
lie. I don't really listen to music.

5940
10:45:50,940 --> 10:45:54,319
We, I know, he

5941
10:45:54,319 --> 10:45:56,319
eats baby food and doesn't listen to music.

5942
10:45:56,319 --> 10:45:58,319
Okay, check box one, check box

5943
10:45:58,319 --> 10:46:00,319
two. He is a sociopath. I know

5944
10:46:00,319 --> 10:46:02,319
like if you were a doctor you'd probably be like you fucking

5945
10:46:02,319 --> 10:46:04,319
something wrong with you. I don't

5946
10:46:04,319 --> 10:46:06,319
really listen to, I don't really, I don't. I don't

5947
10:46:06,319 --> 10:46:12,269
listen to music that much.

5948
10:46:12,269 --> 10:46:17,459
He's a baby. Clip this

5949
10:46:17,459 --> 10:46:20,529
and show it to the doctor.

5950
10:46:20,529 --> 10:46:22,529
Thanks for the 300 bits, appreciate it.

5951
10:46:22,529 --> 10:46:24,529
Thanks for 250. Are you ever going to attempt The Royal Flush

5952
10:46:24,529 --> 10:46:26,529
yourself on stream after doing

5953
10:46:26,529 --> 10:46:32,540
some practice? Martin

5954
10:46:32,540 --> 10:46:34,540
had a meme thanks to 250. Hey there

5955
10:46:34,540 --> 10:46:36,540
Whittle Jeremy. Baby Gap

5956
10:46:36,540 --> 10:46:38,540
Gaming here. We're wondering if

5957
10:46:38,540 --> 10:46:40,540
you'd like to be sponsored by us instead of the big boy

5958
10:46:40,540 --> 10:46:42,540
Gap Gaming. We think our baby

5959
10:46:42,540 --> 10:46:44,540
products fit more in line with your mentality

5960
10:46:44,540 --> 10:46:46,540
and height.

5961
10:46:46,540 --> 10:46:49,300
Martin had a meme thanks for the pretend

5962
10:46:49,300 --> 10:46:51,300
we're joking around having

5963
10:46:51,300 --> 10:46:53,300
a good time post stream

5964
10:46:53,300 --> 10:46:55,300
having fun message.

5965
10:46:55,300 --> 10:46:57,980
Thank you.

5966
10:46:57,980 --> 10:46:59,980
Hey Shoesip thanks for the 300 bits.

5967
10:46:59,980 --> 10:47:01,980
Hey Jeremy I appreciate the content and streams helping me

5968
10:47:01,980 --> 10:47:03,980
through some tough times. Keep it up.

5969
10:47:03,980 --> 10:47:09,220
I wish you the best. Hopefully you get

5970
10:47:09,220 --> 10:47:11,220
through what you're going through with ease.

5971
10:47:11,220 --> 10:47:15,940
Hopefully it's not as hard.

5972
10:47:15,940 --> 10:47:17,940
Not sure whatever it is but I hope

5973
10:47:17,940 --> 10:47:20,500
you get through it. Thank you.

5974
10:47:20,500 --> 10:47:24,699
The 300 bits. And finally

5975
10:47:24,699 --> 10:47:27,839
let's get to the end.

5976
10:47:27,839 --> 10:47:29,839
This is the end.

5977
10:47:29,839 --> 10:47:32,459
Silent Serenity with 250.

5978
10:47:32,459 --> 10:47:35,410
Do you have a vent to Kim

5979
10:47:35,410 --> 10:47:37,410
about how chat bullies you?

5980
10:47:37,410 --> 10:47:43,730
No.

5981
10:47:43,730 --> 10:47:45,730
No I don't think so.

5982
10:47:45,730 --> 10:47:49,889
I think about that so well you guys

5983
10:47:49,889 --> 10:47:51,889
think I turn the stream off and I just like go in there and I'm like

5984
10:47:51,889 --> 10:47:53,889
let me fucking tell you something.

5985
10:47:53,889 --> 10:47:55,889
Man I'm so sick of that shit.

5986
10:47:55,889 --> 10:47:57,889
Like what the fuck did you see what they said

5987
10:47:57,889 --> 10:47:59,889
today? Were you reading when they

5988
10:47:59,889 --> 10:48:01,889
said that? They said like oh he's short

5989
10:48:01,889 --> 10:48:03,889
he's fucking stupid.

5990
10:48:03,889 --> 10:48:06,769
These motherfuckers

5991
10:48:06,769 --> 10:48:10,669
let me tell you

5992
10:48:10,669 --> 10:48:13,680
I don't not do that.

5993
10:48:13,680 --> 10:48:16,430
You know what happens when I turn the stream off

5994
10:48:16,430 --> 10:48:18,430
and I walk into the bedroom over there?

5995
10:48:18,430 --> 10:48:20,430
You know my first words to Kim are

5996
10:48:20,430 --> 10:48:22,430
usually every single time I turn the stream off.

5997
10:48:22,430 --> 10:48:32,860
What do you think it is?

5998
10:48:32,860 --> 10:48:34,860
It's I'm hungry.

5999
10:48:34,860 --> 10:48:37,300
What do you want to do for food?

6000
10:48:37,300 --> 10:48:39,300
Are you hungry? Have you eaten?

6001
10:48:39,300 --> 10:48:45,180
Do you feel like anything in particular?

6002
10:48:45,180 --> 10:48:47,180
Do you want to get

6003
10:48:47,180 --> 10:48:49,180
sushi or something? Do you want to get

6004
10:48:49,180 --> 10:48:51,180
Mediterranean?

6005
10:48:51,180 --> 10:48:54,449
Do you want pizza? I'm hungry.

6006
10:48:54,449 --> 10:49:00,019
It's midnight. Well yeah not tonight.

6007
10:49:00,019 --> 10:49:05,839
We went late tonight.

6008
10:49:05,839 --> 10:49:07,839
Typically the streams turn off around

6009
10:49:07,839 --> 10:49:09,839
9pm, 9, 10pm Pacific.

6010
10:49:09,839 --> 10:49:14,129
I stream for like

6011
10:49:14,129 --> 10:49:16,129
six and a half hours, seven hours typically.

6012
10:49:16,129 --> 10:49:18,129
So yeah it's like

6013
10:49:18,129 --> 10:49:20,750
eight, nine, nine o'clock.

6014
10:49:20,750 --> 10:49:22,750
You go late every night.

6015
10:49:22,750 --> 10:49:25,440
Only the last couple

6016
10:49:25,440 --> 10:49:27,440
weeks really have I been doing more than ten

6017
10:49:27,440 --> 10:49:29,440
hour streams.

6018
10:49:29,440 --> 10:49:33,019
That's a pretty recent thing.

6019
10:49:33,019 --> 10:49:35,019
It was very rare for me to go

6020
10:49:35,019 --> 10:49:37,019
over nine hours. Very rare.

6021
10:49:37,019 --> 10:49:43,220
But I'll see you

6022
10:49:43,220 --> 10:49:45,220
guys tomorrow for Diablo 2.

6023
10:49:45,220 --> 10:49:51,809
The streams have only been going long

6024
10:49:51,809 --> 10:49:53,809
when you start early. But that's, we talked about

6025
10:49:53,809 --> 10:49:55,809
that though. That's another big point.

6026
10:49:55,809 --> 10:49:57,809
Starting at like 1 to 2pm Pacific

6027
10:49:57,809 --> 10:49:59,809
the streams can just go longer because

6028
10:49:59,809 --> 10:50:01,809
it doesn't go until like 3am

6029
10:50:01,809 --> 10:50:03,809
Pacific.

6030
10:50:03,809 --> 10:50:05,809
Much easier to stay live when

6031
10:50:05,809 --> 10:50:07,809
it's not too late for every

6032
10:50:07,809 --> 10:50:11,709
single person.

6033
10:50:11,709 --> 10:50:13,709
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

6034
10:50:13,709 --> 10:50:15,709
Much love to you. Get some rest.

6035
10:50:15,709 --> 10:50:18,209
If we see you tomorrow, we see you tomorrow. If not

6036
10:50:18,209 --> 10:50:20,699
then maybe we'll see you again soon.

6037
10:50:20,699 --> 10:50:24,480
Take care and bye for now.
