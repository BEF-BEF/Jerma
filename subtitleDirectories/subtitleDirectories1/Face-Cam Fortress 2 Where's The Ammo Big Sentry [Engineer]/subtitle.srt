00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,199
Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Facecam Fortress 2

2
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:20,519
Mondays edition. And I'm going to play as the engineer. I'm kind of late right now. Oh god,

3
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,640
there's only five, only five seconds and I've done, this is level one. This thing's going

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,260
down immediately, but this is on Thunder Mountain. And hopefully, come on, come on, come on,

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,750
come on, come on. Yes. At least it's level two.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:47,710
From the JAG, the Frontier of Justice, and the pistol. Good to know. Spike. See if I

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,869
can not. What is this guy doing? I love this guy's hat, this chicken head thing. That's

8
00:00:51,869 --> 00:01:00,710
from the Adult Swim Pyro Mania. Woo! Update. Somebody come on out. Is there anybody? Okay,

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:11,299
there's people in here, yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No ammo, no ammo. Oh, dun, dun, dun, dun.

10
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:19,939
Oh man, Scout. Why did you do that to me? Whoa, that's how you fall down. How is that,

11
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:27,299
how is that center still up? I have no idea. Looks like it's going to stay up. Of course

12
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:37,500
it is. Get this. Don't worry, it's going up. I got you. I got you, baby. Whoa, whoa, hold

13
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:49,980
on here. What I just, where is this guy? Is he back here? Anybody, anybody, anybody want

14
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,780
to take a shot in the face? You are a spy, for sure, I bet. No, you are not a spy. I

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,859
need to get that ammo. Oh my god, everyone just keeps picking up the ammo. Why must you

16
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:17,090
torment me like this, team? Sorry, I'll get it now. Sanctuary. It's still up. What a miracle.

17
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,719
I think it might be time for this thing to move. Yeah, come on. It might be time for

18
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:30,139
this thing to move. Maybe not quite. Come on, get the, where's the ammo? Where's the

19
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:36,500
ammo? That's going to be the title of this video. Where's the ammo? Get this thing to

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:52,129
level two at least. Spy around here. Speaking of spies, I better watch my butt. Level three.

21
00:02:52,129 --> 00:03:01,409
Oh boy. You. Oh, you're going to do like the little sneaky snake move, huh? Not going to

22
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:12,340
work on me, baby. Well, I think at least we're winning. Technically, I guess. Come get some

23
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:23,009
help, man. Vote for the next map. Oh, what's that one? I got a feeling this is going down.

24
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:29,469
Yikes. That's what you do. And then you come over here and you, whoa, no, you don't. Let's see if

25
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:38,669
we can get out of here. Ready? Come on. Come on. Oh, nothing I could do there. Besides kill

26
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:53,189
back. No. Oh, what? I just found a hat. Cool. You have just found a hat in the comment section.

27
00:03:53,189 --> 00:04:02,240
Somebody tell me, uh, what is the actual percentage of finding a hat? Is it 1% 0.2%? Like

28
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:12,490
what's the actual percentage? I'm actually pretty curious to know what that is. Hmm. Someone,

29
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,889
someone give me some, give me some ammo. Give me that sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick,

30
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:30,740
sick. This is sick. Level two going up. Oh, I just like pumped two shots at him. Just, just, just for

31
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,920
fun. Oh, don't want to. I need to keep at least a little bit in case they try and take it out. Oh,

32
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:49,500
he's hiding. Oh, he needs like one shot. Very good. Very good. I need to get some more ammo.

33
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,779
Come on. One of you bastards. Give me some of your stuff. I think that was it. Mmm. Save it. Oh,

34
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:06,519
it's not good. It's not good. It's going to go down. No, it won't. No, it won't. Give me these two

35
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:23,699
things. Oh, get away. Oh, no, you don't. Spy, you prickly little bastard. Oh, they are really

36
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:30,310
getting mad about this century. I need a dispenser, but there's no time. There's no time for that.

37
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:39,939
Whoa. Eight kills. This thing is on a rampage. Oh, do I dare? Do I dare put up a dispenser? I

38
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:56,459
don't know. Oh, I don't know. Okay. Whatever. Run. Hey, you are not. Oh, I had to run away.

39
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:07,319
I'm just putting a dispenser here. Oh, you got to be. You've got to be kidding me, man. No way. Oh,

40
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,970
that's. Wow. I can't believe that just happened. Boy, do you have a dead ringer? He must have had

41
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:27,829
a dead ringer. I had so many crits right there. Of course. Gosh. No. That's not the way I want to go.

42
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:35,189
I want to go this way right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

43
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,949
I feel like I was just on scare Saturdays right there. That was terrifying.

44
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:57,750
You are a spy. No, you're not. I've got to get a century up here. A good one. But yeah, like I

45
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,430
was saying, I really felt like I was on scare Saturdays right there. Spy just. Oh, that was so

46
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:11,829
horrible. I would have gone on such a tear. Oh, well, what can you do? Right? Put it right here.

47
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:20,420
They got to come through here. And when I got my stuff all built up, they ain't going to do anything.

48
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:30,060
They can just bumped into a spy. Speaking of spies. Here it comes. Come on. Get it to level two.

49
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:42,819
No. What is that guy doing? Wow. Okay. Kill him. Kill him. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no. Get out

50
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:51,500
of here. Get out of here. He's probably not dead. I would be very surprised if that guy was actually

51
00:07:51,500 --> 00:08:06,459
dead. Maybe he is. Oh, the domination sound means he is. I think. Could be wrong on that one. Watch

52
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:18,230
it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Out of my way. Out of my way. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. By the way, what

53
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:25,610
I'm doing right now. Here's a little, a little engineer tip. So if you get in a situ. Okay. So

54
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,039
here's it. He didn't die. He's still right here, isn't he? No, he's not. So here's the engineer tip

55
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,960
I was just going to give you. When you are building something. Oh, God. When you are. I

56
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,360
can't even like get my tip off. There's so much chaos. When you are building something, right.

57
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,480
What you want to do is you want to hit it. Turn. Hit it. Turn. Hit it. Turn. You never lose any time.

58
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,740
You just are finding any spies behind you. So just like this. Ready? Bang. Swing. Bang. Swing. Bang.

59
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Bang. You don't lose any time and it's a good way to watch behind you.

60
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,409
Just a little engineer tip when your back is turned to the fight. I think we're going to win.

61
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:14,379
I think we're actually going to win. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. Here comes the last push.

62
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:22,440
Well, not really. There's a minute and a half left. There's still plenty of time. Oh, yeah. Thanks,

63
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,500
Pyro. Hey, can you like repair my level three sentry dude? Thanks. Oh, homewrecker Pyro. I love

64
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:38,740

65
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,379
but I can't, I don't want to itch it. I don't want to itch it. This is too important.

66
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:55,059
Oh, that guy's so dead. If he, if he pokes his head around. No. Oh, I just got to shoot him.

67
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:05,590
Oh, just let it die. He got, oh, oh, spy. They're going to win now. They're going to cap it. Oh,

68
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:15,639
get on there. Get on there. If I didn't miss him with my shotgun. No. Just get back over there

69
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:23,769
and do whatever you can. Just drop this right here. What? What? What just happened? What on

70
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:29,399

71
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,470
come on, come on, come on. This is very important. This is so important. This has to go up right now.

72
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:47,690
This is so important. So important. So important. No, no. Two Pyros. Two Pyros. Four, three, two,

73
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:57,990
