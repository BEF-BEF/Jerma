1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,820
Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Anti-Chamber.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,820
I don't really know that much about this game because I just downloaded it, just installed it not that long ago.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,059
So all I know about this game is it's weird. It's a weird game, it's got weird mechanics,

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:36,299
and it's like a puzzle art project adventure game with a throw-up experience.

6
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:42,299
So I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't think I'm gonna let's play this whole game, unless you guys really want to see that.

7
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,299
I'm gonna try and get as far as I can, maybe play for like 15-20 minutes, we'll see.

8
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:53,359
But anyways, time remaining. Do I only have like an hour and a half to beat this whole game? What the hell does that even mean?

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,359
Alright, all my settings are okay. Let's get started here.

10
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,979
No, I do not want to go through the exit. I know you start here, that's all I know.

11
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,480
Here we go, choose your destination. Leap of faith, baby.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:12,430
So already this game kind of gives me a headache. If it gives you a headache too, I apologize.

13
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,750
Jump! That didn't work. Okay.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,620
This game reminds me... Oh, is that another... Whoa. Whoa!

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,609
Look at it, it's like building the floor around me. Can I like jump on that?

16
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,519
What the... What? What the hell did I just even do?

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:43,519
Alright, well apparently I fell through like the second floor. I can't get back up there, let's see. What is this?

18
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,590
Failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress. Gotcha. Let's go.

19
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,969
Let's go down like the secret super 80s hallway. Where's like Janis Joplin?

20
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,909
Girls, just wanna have fun. That's not Janis Joplin.

21
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,670
Some paths are clearer than others. Alright.

22
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,849
Hey, where's like Dilbert? I feel like Dilbert's gonna come out and yell at me. Look at these like comic book graphics.

23
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,819
Alright, red or blue? Do I want to be on defense or offense?

24
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,509
Alright, let's go on offense. Yay!

25
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,659
I don't know what that did. Okay. Hmm, I'm thinking.

26
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:31,860
A choice may be as simple as going left or going right. That's what I just did.

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,860
Alright, let's go on red team. We're gonna go on like Thunder Mountain on defense on red. I'm gonna play the soldier. Here we go.

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,650
Oh, this game gives me a headache. What? I already did this.

29
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,009
The choice doesn't matter if the outcome is the same. So it does not matter if I go left or right.

30
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:56,509
Hold on, I need some Dr. Pepper to help think about what's going on here. I got it, we're going blue.

31
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:02,530
The stairs up here, though. This game is supposed to teach you to not think regularly.

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,530
You're supposed to think outside the box. Can I like jump on these stairs?

33
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,289
You're telling me I can't like jump and like spin around and go down that way. I definitely can.

34
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:16,599
Jump, spin, freak out. That's not working. Let's just go over here.

35
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:25,509
Again, is there no more clues? Am I really lost on the first puzzle of this goddamn game?

36
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:31,680
Can I like move through here? No, I can't.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,139
I can't. It's probably something maybe if I jump like this.

38
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:47,409
Damn it. Hold on a second. What if I go back?

39
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:51,409
Ah, there it is. My house is on fire now.

40
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,409
When you return to where you have been, things aren't always as remembered.

41
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,580
How are you supposed to figure that out? How are you supposed to figure this out?

42
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,580
I just like walked over here because I was being a weirdo.

43
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Maybe it's because the stairs are going this way, too?

44
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,580
The stairs let go. Wow, this game is for a way smarter person than me.

45
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
I probably won't even get past level one, guys. I'm not going to lie.

46
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,830
Alright, let's go.

47
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,649
I don't think I can do this for that much longer.

48
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,980
Alright, don't touch. Can I crouch?

49
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,800
Alright, apparently I'm supposed to touch that.

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,810
Should I hit escape right now to not get like laser beamed?

51
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,259
Oh, if you don't like where you've ended up, try doing something else.

52
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:45,899
So I ended up back here. Alright.

53
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,170
Alright, I did what it told me to.

54
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,170
Taking the first step can be harder than the rest of the challenge.

55
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,670
That's it? So I shouldn't have even jumped at the beginning? Let's go this way.

56
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,670
What the? What the hell just happened?

57
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:08,120
Whoa. Where? Where am I right now? Do I go down?

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,579
Oh, where am I going? What is happening?

59
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:21,730
What is happening? I am so lost right now.

60
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,730
Guys, it's not even funny.

61
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,420
I managed to... I'm still going down apparently.

62
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,680
Is this like a teleporter? Come on, let's go.

63
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,310
Whoa, jump. So do I have to jump? Okay, do I jump down from this?

64
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,660
This is really freaking me out. I definitely have to jump straight down.

65
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,860
That is definitely an illusion, alright.

66
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,180
Yeah. Okay, we're back. Up here again.

67
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,100
I gotta jump off. Alright, I get it. I got it. I got it.

68
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,339
Here we go. Ready? Ready? Ready? Come on, let's go.

69
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,839
Now get me off. Yeah. What does this one say?

70
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,550
Dig a little deeper and you may find something new.

71
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,699
Should I go down here? No, we're going to go in this room.

72
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:22,250
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What? Alright, whatever. Let's go.

73
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,019
What appears impossible may have a very simple answer.

74
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,740
Alright, where's your PhD to play this game?

75
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,740
How we perceive a problem can change every time we see it.

76
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,199
F-E-L-I.

77
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,379
F-I-L-I-F-I-F.

78
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,069
Felfief? Look at the Illuminati looking at me.

79
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:53,730
What is happening? What is this god damn game?

80
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,540
Look at this like trippy freaking...

81
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,389
Am I supposed to solve this puzzle? What is that?

82
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,620
Where is it going? I'm going to follow this down the hall.

83
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on, block. Little block. Little purple block.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,209
Tick all the way down.

85
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:24,490
This is a trippy room. This is an absolutely trippy room.

86
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,649
Can we speed this up here, Block? Let's go.

87
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:33,720
Alright, hold on, I wanna look at the stuff, hold on.

88
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,699
Wow. Wow.

89
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,300
I'm closing one eye right now, guys.

90
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,860
One eye is closed.

91
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,689
Because this game is hurting my head.

92
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,899
This better be worth it! I better not have to be wasting my time doing this.

93
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,370
Hold on, I wanna see where this ends up.

94
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,990
Oh, it ends up over here- what the hell?

95
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,240
It ends up over here.

96
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,620
I'm saying, I am gonna push this all the way.

97
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,170
Go, go, go, go, go.

98
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,250
Make your way across.

99
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,500
So what can I talk about while this does this for the next six minutes?

100
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,100
Well, we'll talk about the color purple.

101
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,620
So what things are purple?

102
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,990
Um, lollipops can be purple.

103
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,879
The Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers have purple in their uniform.

104
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,059
Hmm, other things that are purple- a grape?

105
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,570
You can get purple grapes from the grocery store.

106
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,649
They're delicious, they're nice and juicy and cool.

107
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,049
And put them in the freezer, they're even better.

108
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:52,559
You can have- alright, hold on, we're almost done, we're almost done.

109
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,000
What did this just do?

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,940
What?

111
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,710
Where did it go? I just lost it!

112
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,860
When- what?

113
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,950
What is in there?

114
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,480
Hold on, I wanna find my purple block.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
This is- this is- what?

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Did I honestly just do that for no reason?

117
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Stop looking at me, I.

118
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,950
Oh, I get it.

119
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,250
I gotta look at this while I move backwards.

120
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,769
Oh, figured it out.

121
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:32,940
A few steps backwards may keep you moving forward.

122
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,789
Oh, whoa.

123
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:41,230
This is just renamed this game, Acid Trip the Game.

124
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,129
This is just Acid Trip the Game.

125
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,580
It simulates taking a ton of acid.

126
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,529
Window of opportunity can lead to new places if you are willing to take a closer look.

127
00:09:57,789 --> 00:09:58,110
What?

128
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,980
So can I- should I like not look at that?

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,940
Or should I look over here?

130
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm just gonna go this way.

131
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,340
Hey.

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,320
Where am I?

133
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
What's happening?

134
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,970
Where am I?

135
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,129
Where's my flashlight?

136
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,009
I don't even know where I'm going.

137
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
Apparently, I ended up somewhere.

138
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,700
Look a little harder and you will find a way forward.

139
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:40,350
What?

140
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,009
I- hold on a second.

141
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,610
This is the thing that was here earlier.

142
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,740
If you said, Jerma, I'll pay you a million dollars to put this where it's supposed to be,

143
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:54,340
I wouldn't get it.

144
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,860
I would not get the million dollars.

145
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,049
I would have to- I- I'm gonna say it's probably supposed to go right there.

146
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,669
But that's definitely not what's supposed to happen.

147
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,409
What if I pick this up?

148
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,450
Can I pick this up and then leave?

149
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,309
Last time I did this, the whole world changed.

150
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,139
All right, here we go.

151
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,279
It's gonna change.

152
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,159
Look at that.

153
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,559
Wow.

154
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,009
Venturing into the unknown can lead to great rewards.

155
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,850
Yeah, I have like this block.

156
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,090
I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do with it though.

157
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,750
The end may come before we were ready to get there.

158
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,190
No, I don't want to go out that way.

159
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah, this is the- wait.

160
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,779
Did I just beat the game?

161
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,700
Life isn't about- life isn't about getting to the end.

162
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,460
Oh yeah, I like beat the game.

163
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,419
Except I didn't.

164
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,460
What about this way?

165
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,179
Hey, look at this.

166
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,419
More stuff.

167
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,059
Look into this thing and the world changes, right?

168
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,179
Still holding this blue block.

169
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:07,700
I want to read that.

170
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,220
Uh, sure.

171
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:12,830
Why not?

172
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,460
Should I go around the other side and look?

173
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,659
Oh yes, I should.

174
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,649
Hey, hello.

175
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,509
At times we need to view the world from someone else's perspective.

176
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,340
Very true.

177
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,299
Very true.

178
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,710
Does that mean I can leave now?

179
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,190
It does.

180
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,519
Uh, what?

181
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,039
Venturing into the unknown can lead to great rewards.

182
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,159
Yeah, I already did this.

183
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,110
Was I able to go through somewhere else?

184
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,179
Still holding.

185
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,139
Let's switch this again.

186
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,860
Switch this again.

187
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,139
Was this thing here last time?

188
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,980
Confused.

189
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,580
All right, that was not there this time.

190
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,820
So now let's open it up again.

191
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Let's go through.

192
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,500
I can't go that way.

193
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,600
What if I put that there?

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,779
Nope.

195
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,980
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

196
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,779
Can't see again.

197
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,500
What's that?

198
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,110
What's that thing?

199
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,820
I want to go in there.

200
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,769
Let me in there.

201
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,250
Bastard.

202
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,100
Wait, hold on.

203
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,139
There's another one of these.

204
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,820
No, this is back to this weird room.

205
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,750
Shit.

206
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,379
Damn it.

207
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,980
I need two of these friggin' blocks?

208
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,299
You gotta be kidding me.

209
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,259
Where's the other one?

210
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:48,100
Where's the other block?

211
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,340
And that is going to wrap up my initial video on Antichamber.

212
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,059
Again, I'm not sure if I'm going to play through this whole thing.

213
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,820
I don't think I'm gonna let's play this whole game.

214
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,419
Just wanted to give you guys my initial reaction to the craziness that is in this game.

215
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:07,860
Highly recommend this game if you are into the puzzle genre or the physics simulation type genre.

216
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,539
Because this one is a mind bender.

217
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,059
It truly is, as you've seen in this video.

218
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,980
But that's gonna wrap it up, guys.

219
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,019
I'll see you all next time.

220
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,419
And of course, take care, everybody.
