1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:13,500
Well hello. Welcome to Christmas Eve, god darn it. Oh yeah, that was an ordeal. Taleks and I have been

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,539
painstakingly trying to get this ready for the last probably about three and a half hours.

3
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:27,339
We had some issues, but the issues have been fixed, I think. I hope so. And we're ready to

4
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:36,179
have a Christmas Eve party. Happy Christmas Eve everybody. And how the heck are ya? Hope you're

5
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:43,140
having a great day. Conductor drummer is on the case, as you see. I've got my costume on. I've got

6
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,579
my... I forget about the branding on that thing. I was going to cover it up before the stream

7
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,780
started, but I did it somehow. I got a nice tree. I've got my nice brick backdrop here.

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,130
Put on any presents under the tree here that was picked by you guys in the mods too.

9
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,219
Welcome to Christmas Eve. Yeah, sure, I started like an hour and a half late.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,439
Typically, I would love to have started an hour ago, but camera broke. We had some lighting

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,680
issues. I had some fucking OBS issues, but you know, whatever. It's Christmas Eve. Merry

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,239
Christmas. Happy holidays. How are ya? So let's break down what we're going to do.

13
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,450
Over here, let's... You're probably wondering why the fuck there's a printer here.

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,209
This is the extreme magic fax machine. So anytime that you want to send me a message or want to

15
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:40,090
talk to me, you're going to use your magical fucking computer and I'll get it somehow through

16
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:47,769
a bit donation. Hopefully it works. I hope it's hooked up correctly because there should be

17
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:51,530
messages from the fucking people coming out here. And if there's not, then you know,

18
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,010
we'll have to fucking unplug and plug it back in. Presents over here, tree over here.

19
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,650
I got a train set ready to build. Oh, Jeremy, you look like a fucking dickhead.

20
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,409
Well, you know what? Sometimes you look like a dickhead. Oh my God.

21
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:19,219
Okay. So my fucking fly was undone in the very beginning. That's a fantastic start.

22
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:22,979
Why don't we move over to the train set? Because I'm in the conductor round,

23
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,180
couldn't might as well do it here. Welcome frame, everybody.

24
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:41,379
So I got, I can't fucking believe my fly. Did you see my fly undone? Hey,

25
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,340
you tell us. Was my fly, did you see my fly undone?

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,629
Was my fly actually undone? Why did you like tell me that?

27
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,340
He's fucking over there being a director. All right. So hey,

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,060
Choo Choo, what do you say here? We got our train set here. I figured it'd be a fun start.

29
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,060
The first part of the stream should be about building and creating.

30
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,539
So I have, this is going to be fucking ridiculous.

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,060
Here is the train that I have. We're going to build a train set on the frame.

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,460
And this is kind of going to be a present that I'm going to give to

33
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:31,430
probably a local library, I would assume. I'm going to probably donate this to a library

34
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,590
because what the fuck am I going to do with this after the streams over? I have no idea.

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:43,189
So let's get started here. It's called the South Pacific train. It looks like you keep and score.

36
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,789
Can you see the shit? Does this look good? So I got pieces here.

37
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,069
I got straights, I got curves, and I kind of don't know what to do.

38
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:02,199
I'm thinking like a figure eight. This shit, this, this moves by the way. If you're like,

39
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,759
oh, Jeremy, it doesn't move. How can it move the fucking mic?

40
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:17,480
Hold on. This looks getting good.

41
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:28,839
Good. Can you hear me? It's my fucking flyer. Jesus Christ. Okay. Hey,

42
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,639
Merry Christmas, by the way, everybody. How the heck are you?

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:43,699
So within 10 seconds of the fucking stream, my fly. All right.

44
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,819
I'm going to say if we start, because this is a real train. Like I said, it's going to move

45
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:57,180
in various directions. I need the plug to go in here though. The plug has to go in here.

46
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,420
This is a real fucking train, ladies and gentlemen. So we have to start.

47
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:09,319
I don't want to break this. This is going to a library. God damn it.

48
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:24,100
Just get the fuck over here. Right here. I'm going to plug it in. Am I going to get electrocuted

49
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:39,860
if I do this? Okay. I did not get electrocuted. Train there. Okay. So I have to start here.

50
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:49,449
Is that an error message? I don't know if that's an error message.

51
00:05:50,649 --> 00:06:01,430
All right. Shut the fuck up. All right. You got to match the fucking lines up here,

52
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:12,759
folks. I got to get like a bird's eye view because I'm thinking straight.

53
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,120
And what a goddamn train this is. Straight and then around

54
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:27,269
and then maybe straight and around again. Yes, I'm aware that I look like a total

55
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:44,310
fucking dickhead. I'm aware. So like, here we go right here. So these trains.

56
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,100
Let me show them. I don't know why I'm so afraid of electricity right now.

57
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:02,939
Ah, here we go. Okay, that's in. So should I do like some tricks?

58
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm thinking like at least two loops. Let's block it out. So if I go like that,

59
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:24,310
that's a huge you. But I got to make sure I can actually get off of me.

60
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,029
I got to make sure I can actually connect it. No, that can't go there.

61
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:38,579
I'll be amazed if this actually works. I can one loop around and then maybe straight

62
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:48,439
and then around again. That looks better. I hope you're enjoying your holiday here.

63
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:10,250
There. I got this little piece. Like, what is this for? This looks like it can go

64
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:18,730
across and then through this way too, right? But that's sort of figure eight.

65
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,420
Close enough. Maybe I should have wrote this down. Because right now it's going to be

66
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:41,080
like a loop and then another. Hold on. How can I get a loop? I don't think I can get

67
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,620
it to work because if I go like that, I guess maybe it could go around in another

68
00:08:47,620 --> 00:09:09,210
circle and then through here. It looks like one more. Oh, that's going to look actually

69
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:37,500
really cool. One or will this work? That's not going to work. What if I go like

70
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:47,059
so through here and then this, how am I supposed to get this to go this way?

71
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,990
You know what I'm saying? Like how am I supposed to get this to go all the way around?

72
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:11,159
Is it even possible? This segment was supposed to be about 20 minutes. Don't think that's going

73
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:31,029
to be the case anymore. Get it like this. All right. I'm going to build out from here.

74
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:41,080
That's what I'm going to do. If I go out from here, don't worry. The train will,

75
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,059
you'll ride on the train in a second. Look at it to work. I'm going to say like this

76
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,500
and then like that. I don't care that much about how cool it looks. You know what I mean?

77
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,700
I care about it working. That's all I give a shit about.

78
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:09,269
So then we're going to fuck this whole thing up. Get in here. Plastic on it.

79
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:31,750
Don't break it. Don't break it. I'm going to break it. I don't want to. That's the problem

80
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:39,909
here. Get in there. Come on. Come on. I got a stream to run.

81
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:59,860
Somebody is probably telling me, Jeremy, you should probably put some jump in there and

82
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,950
put some obstacles in there. Yeah. I can't even get the whole thing built before that.

83
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:10,940
I was going to have like trees and shit to go around. Why is this going in?

84
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:27,059
What have I done that's wrong? All right. It's in. Got it. All right. Finally. Oh,

85
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:36,700
God. All right. Connect this. It's supposed to be easy assembly in my ass. Much easier

86
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:44,759
than the other one. All right. So here we go. Starting here, right around. This thing makes

87
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:58,649
noise and shit too, guys. So then let's get a straight track ahead. I'm going to lap my

88
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:06,259
ass off. I built this whole thing and it just doesn't work at all. I spend all the time doing

89
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:13,690
this and then turn it on and it just fucking sits still. Oh, get your fucking frog champs.

90
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:20,379
Oh, what the fuck? Ow. Seriously, that fucking hurt. This is designed for like 11 year olds.

91
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:34,700
How did I just hurt myself? Get in there. No, that's not in there, right? Get in there.

92
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:50,659
This thing's bent. How did I bend it already? Oh, you motherfucker.

93
00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:04,679
On the side. So when I was looking at the box, this thing looks actually really fucking cool.

94
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:17,179
It makes noise. It has smoke that I'm not going to use. What am I doing? All right. No,

95
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:31,019
no, no, no, no. That's good. That's good. That's fine. Let's go this way. Yes. All right.

96
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:40,789
Do it again. I'll be fucking surprised. Okay. That's good. How does it look so far?

97
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:56,470
What are they saying? Anything bad? Hold on. He just went, he just went like this.

98
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:06,490
He just went like this. Well, you don't like this? You don't think this is cool?

99
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:20,440
I got a train set. God damn it. He just goes like this. All right. Fine. Let's build a

100
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,710
fucking train. Just wait till I turn this thing on. And that was a horrible voice crack,

101
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:35,580
but Dutch does it. So it's okay. Dutch made the voice crack cool again. Like made it like,

102
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:45,110
okay to do it. I hate it. I hated the train segment. That was the worst part of the

103
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:53,620
cryptocurrency stream. Like fuck that whole segment. What? He built a train on stream?

104
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:03,990
I hope he fucking pees his pants. Oh, don't. This is nice. Okay. Hold on. Let me tell

105
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:18,629
you. This is just part one of the night. Okay. So just relax around the circle and

106
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:37,419
then it's got to go this way. How the fuck am I going to get it to go that way? This? All

107
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:45,940
right. I gotta check this out. Watch this. Ready? Bang. What if this is the whole stream?

108
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:53,509
I just baited you guys so hard. It's just me building a fucking train set in front of

109
00:16:53,509 --> 00:17:05,589
fucking 40,000 people. All right. So is that going to work? Oh my God. It's not going to

110
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:17,799
work. No, this is not going to do anything. Plug it in. Let me see. So I want to see.

111
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:46,279
I just want to make sure the thing works. Okay. Here we go. Ready?

112
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:25,980
Wait. Oh, this is stupid, Jeremy. God damn it. I need to see if it goes. Whoa, whoa,

113
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:51,220
whoa, whoa. Oh yeah. Plug chip. Oh, this is bad. I need to get like a closed loop.

114
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:09,670
I can't even get it closed. I screwed the whole thing up. I mean, no, because this

115
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:42,440
has to come off. That. Oh, baby boy. He figured it out. Take a look at this shit. Oh, Jeremy,

116
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,799
this is the worst thing you've ever done on stream. Oh yeah. Has it? You didn't

117
00:19:45,799 --> 00:20:01,829
fucking watch this part. Oh, look at that. Okay. Close. Get this connected again.

118
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:14,630
Oh man, this is going to be good. We're real good. We got starting here,

119
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:23,849
around, through, and then around. Stomp it. Stomp it. Jeremy, stomp the train. No, I'm not.

120
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:40,730
Why? Please give it a rest. Every little bit. Okay. All right. Then around this way.

121
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,750
Come on. Yeah, I know you can do it.

122
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,660
Round and then close it. And then if we can get a full loop, I'll be happy.

123
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:05,819
This thing is fucking cool. I might just be saying that because everyone's probably fucking

124
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:12,059
talking about how this is the worst thing ever. No, they're not. But I can't see. You know

125
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:28,200
what I mean? Right here. All right, that's good. As long as these things are actually

126
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:38,420
connected well. And they are. So I need to connect it here. And that's a full loop and

127
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,049
we're going full blast. I'm going to play the fucking noises. I'm going to play the

128
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:54,569
fucking sound effects. It's going to be so awesome. Just edit that part out, dude.

129
00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:13,640
I know you're watching. Look, this is good. Some library is going to get this. A local

130
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,759
library. And they're going to make some cool display and it's going to be fucking awesome.

131
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm just testing the goddamn thing, okay? Once you see it go around the whole track,

132
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:42,019
I think your mind will change. Good. All right. Kind of making a reverse squid.

133
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,710
Am I going to have enough track to do this? I don't think I have enough track

134
00:22:48,789 --> 00:23:08,410
to do it. This is bad. Right there. Don't break anything.

135
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,660
I don't have enough pieces to complete this. Really? One, two. Oh, fucking hell. Come on,

136
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:46,599
really? How do I not have enough pieces to do this? Shit. I guess I could.

137
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,220
What can I do about this? I don't know. Take from here?

138
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,190
Let me just see what happens when I do this.

139
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:21,450
I need a complete circuit before we move on. Don't you understand? That's one

140
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:29,980
that goes up here and around and then... Shit. Let me test it. Is that good? What

141
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:48,170
happened? What happened? What? What's the fucking problem?

142
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:13,109
I think that's good enough. I think that's great. That looked really fun.

143
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,930
Wait, were you playing Thomas the Tank?

144
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:46,410
Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, my God. I need a complete loop. Just get this. I

145
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,130
fucked the whole thing up. I made a pretzel. I was supposed to make a figure eight.

146
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:07,960
I needed to go around the circle once. Just wait. Hold on. Get rid of this fucking

147
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:42,420
piece. I got it. I figured it out. Just wait. Speed run. Here we go. Watch this shit. Here

148
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:58,009
we go. Get it on there. I'm the best. I'm the greatest. Don't break this. This is going to

149
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:52,950
a library. How am I supposed to do this? Close. I just want... I need this piece.

150
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,670
I need the fucking piece that has power. Get out of here for a second.

151
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:12,230
Almost. Do I not understand basic physics? How the fuck am I supposed to connect this?

152
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:21,609
I just want a circle. I need like this here. Wait a minute. Hold on. I'll get it.

153
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:38,089
It's a merry fucking Christmas. Got it. Got it. Where's the electric piece right here?

154
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:56,970
I bent it. I think so. Oh, fuck. Yeah. We've got a complete loop.

155
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:14,140
Oh, baby. Would you look at that? Get it on here. Where's the plug? I just need a circle

156
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:30,700
Okay. It's on there, right? Try to do something fancy and you fuck it all up.

157
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:36,809
I think that's good. Get out of the way. I want a good view of this.

158
00:30:37,369 --> 00:31:11,049
Okay. You ready for the complete loop? Here we go. Here we go.

159
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,579
Thanks for coming to the stream, everybody. That's it. No, you know what? Let's get on

160
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,140
this thing. You want to get on this train? It's a complete loop. Let's get on the

161
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:59,589
fucking train. See? Let's get on it. Let me get in. Let me get on that train.

162
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:55,559
Oh, my goodness. Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it?

163
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:26,420
Welcome. Happy Halloween, you fucking idiots. Welcome to, my magic book sometimes is a little

164
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:39,320
on the weird side. Welcome to an edition. A special holiday edition. A scary story

165
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,960
with me, B.F. Mugler Baron. Oh, and is it going to be a great one today? I'll tell you.

166
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,679
Yes, it will. I've got my fucking magic book. I wish it would stay open. That would be

167
00:35:52,679 --> 00:36:08,650
fantastic. Sometimes you've got to turn off the batteries. Staying open, please.

168
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:13,639
The witches sometimes take over on their own.

169
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:42,380
Okay. So first, I have a selection of stories from my dark magic book. It'll be very,

170
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:50,119
very fond of with one of my favorites. Oh, it's Christmas time, though,

171
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:58,179
you'll be very... What kind of Christmas stories will we be getting? The first tale is called

172
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:11,880
Carol Singers. A collection of horrible fucking deeds. Carol Singers is a scary story for

173
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:20,650
Christmas about a kid whose father and grandfather go from door to door begging for money.

174
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:35,429
It is based on an old horror story by Bernard Kurtz. The vanity. You know,

175
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:43,179
my grandfather was a drunk and my father was a drunk, but I never touched drunk.

176
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:49,980
There's a reason for that. When I was young, times were hard and I grew up poor.

177
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,940
My grandfather and my father never did an honest day's work in their lives.

178
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:06,760
Granddad wasn't good for much, but he played the clarinet like an artist. He taught my

179
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:18,809
father how to play the accordion. This is upside down. It did cause a little bit of an issue.

180
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,900
They would gather a group of friends and go door to door,

181
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,099
playing Christmas music, singing Christmas carols and begging for money.

182
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,820
Afterwards, they would all go down to the pub and spend it on alcohol.

183
00:38:51,780 --> 00:39:02,389
No! Don't do that! On Christmas Eve, they brought me with them. I was too young to play an instrument,

184
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:06,869
so they handed me a triangle and told me to strike it every now and then.

185
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:18,219
I was dark. The snow was falling and cold December wind cut through us like a knife.

186
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:27,030
We kept our heads down and trudged through the snow and sleet. Eventually,

187
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,269
my grandfather stopped and said, this looks like a pretty good place as any.

188
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,030
We were outside a big mansion decorated with Christmas lights.

189
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:48,809
My grandfather knocked on the front door and began to play some old Christmas carols.

190
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:57,719
The door of the house swung open and in the dim light I saw a young woman standing there.

191
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,320
She was holding a tray of glasses in her hand.

192
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:19,349
With a smile, she picked up a glass and held it out, inviting one of the men to drink.

193
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:25,050
My granddad rubbed his hands together with glee.

194
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,079
Just then I looked up and in the window above I saw a face peering up.

195
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:48,539
A face that was hideous beyond words. I looked back at the woman at the doorway

196
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:55,289
and her face was hideous too. Before I could stop her,

197
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,659
my grandfather put a glass to his lips and knocked it back with one big gulp.

198
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:10,260
Oh dear, said the woman in an eerie childish voice. Oh, you've drunk blood, sir.

199
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:24,070
With that, the door slammed shut. My grandfather stumbled backwards and the grass fell from his hand.

200
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:40,099
It's so sad that the deafening crash and he collapsed. I don't remember much after that.

201
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:47,849
All I recall is waking up in the lights of dawn and finding myself lying in the snow.

202
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:55,500
The other men were lying all around me, just waking up themselves.

203
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,539
My father got to his feet and rubbed his head.

204
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,300
The woman had disappeared and the house was boarded up and abandoned.

205
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:13,880
All that was left was a dark red stain in the snow with a glass that broke.

206
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:21,849
My grandfather lay there in the snow beside it, his face purple and swollen.

207
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:37,909
We hurried home that morning and called the police.

208
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,260
They picked up my grandfather's body and brought it to the mortuary.

209
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:48,780
My father told them what had happened, but they didn't believe a word of his tale.

210
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,500
They said the house had been vacant for a hundred years.

211
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,130
One hundred!

212
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,389
After that night, my father was never the same again.

213
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:14,630
He never let another drop of alcohol touch his lips and made sure I didn't die.

214
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,750
That is the story.

215
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,539
Two points!

216
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:31,719
This next tale is, say, one.

217
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:37,139
This next tale is called Vickalritha.

218
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:47,059
Those of you wondering, I didn't get my Halloween stream.

219
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:50,039
So of course I'm going to show up here.

220
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:59,590
Three months went by and get what I was supposed to get, which is a stream for Halloween.

221
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:02,949
Oh, but it's Christmas time!

222
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:03,989
It's Christmas time!

223
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,710
That's all I hear is that.

224
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,590
Vickritha.

225
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,539
I like this one because it has a lot of voices.

226
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:16,250
I love doing those.

227
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,670
They're a lot of fun.

228
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:25,849
Vickritha is a scary story about a legendary monster who lives in the icy

229
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:27,130
wastes of the North Pole.

230
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,860
Bah!

231
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,730
It was Christmas Eve and the family were gathered in the living room.

232
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:39,909
The family was gathered in the living room.

233
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:43,349
The father was reading the newspaper and the mother was knitting a sweater.

234
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:50,519
The children, Jimbo and Steffa, were stretched out on the floor with their crayons

235
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,719
and their coloring books.

236
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,440
Tell us a story, Steffa demanded.

237
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:02,710
A scary one, Jimbo insisted.

238
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:07,190
All right, all right, said their father.

239
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,869
I'm going to tell you about the fearsome, dangerous,

240
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,869
and appalling creature in the world.

241
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,119
It's called Vickritha.

242
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:21,829
Oh, now you've done it, said the mother.

243
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:25,989
You've said his name out loud.

244
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:27,880
Voldemort.

245
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,059
Where is he?

246
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,340
Said Jimbo.

247
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,869
He's the most awful thing in the world.

248
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,070
He lives in a cave in the North Pole.

249
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,389
The coldest, wettest place on earth is where Vickritha makes his home.

250
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,639
He sleeps in the rep of a ship that somehow got squeezed into the mouth of a cave.

251
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,920
He doesn't mind the cold and doesn't mind the wet.

252
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,659
But I think he hates the most.

253
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,929
Here someone say his name.

254
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:08,860
He was very good and he has very good ears.

255
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:17,530
And they get bigger every time his name is spoken anywhere on earth.

256
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:22,760
Sometimes his ears get so big he can use them to fly.

257
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,239
He can fly away with his ears.

258
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:30,599
I don't like this story, Steffa whined.

259
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,440
Play now, her mother said.

260
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,820
If we finish the story before he gets here, everything will be fine.

261
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,699
Do you know why the grither is called the grither?

262
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,650
Why?

263
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,449
Said the children.

264
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:54,789
Because he has fists as big as basketballs and his arms as long as ball constrictors.

265
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,949
Whenever he finds the people who have been speaking his name,

266
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:03,829
he opens up his fists, reaches out his arms and grithers them.

267
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,460
He squeezes them by the head and squeezes their head until it pumps.

268
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,829
Guess Michael Balloon.

269
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:24,659
Ah ah ah ah ah.

270
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:32,010
Give all that.

271
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,400
No, said his father.

272
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,960
He's not like Bigfoot and he's not like the abominable snowman either.

273
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,070
Nobody knows what he looks like for sure.

274
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:50,230
The only people who have ever seen the grither are the people the grither has eaten.

275
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,190
Gonna be you.

276
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,619
He's as tall as a tree and can bend all the way over and touch the ground.

277
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,909
His skin looks like a road map because it's transparent

278
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:11,590
and all the blue and red veins show through.

279
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:21,050
The blue is for the fear, the red is for the rage.

280
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,760
And hurry up and finish the story before he gets here, Stiffle cried.

281
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:53,610
Well, the grither was born on a sailing ship, said her father.

282
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,329
It was blown off course by a storm and got lost in the Arctic sea.

283
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:05,059
They drifted around for weeks and never saw anything but glaciers and icebergs.

284
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,139
Some of the passengers drowned, some froze to death,

285
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,380
some starved and the rest committed suicide.

286
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,070
The grither was born out of the fear and rage of all those people.

287
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:24,889
But why does he kill people, Kimball asked.

288
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:26,710
Nobody knows.

289
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,780
Nobody knows, said his father.

290
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,380
He just doesn't like anyone telling his story.

291
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,860
Is that all, Stiffle asked?

292
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,300
Is that the end of the story?

293
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,260
Well, not quite.

294
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:44,980
Not quite, said her father.

295
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,179
There's only one way to protect yourself from the grither.

296
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:51,219
Only one way.

297
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,949
Maybe you should stop, said the mother and interrupted.

298
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,780
I don't, I think, I think you've scared them enough for tonight.

299
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:11,989
You don't actually believe this story, said the father.

300
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,849
No, the children lied.

301
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:19,050
Well, you shouldn't because I made it all up.

302
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,210
I made the whole story up, said the father.

303
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,530
There's no such thing as the grither.

304
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,489
It's not real.

305
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,809
Oh, why didn't you finish the story, said Stiffle.

306
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,130
All of the sudden, the front door blew open

307
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,409
and the room was enveloped in an icy blast of wind.

308
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:43,369
There was a crash and the sound of breaking glass.

309
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:48,489
Then the two huge, gnarled arms reached in through the windows

310
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,889
and grasped their parents by the head.

311
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:57,210
As the children watched in horror, the hands squeezed

312
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:03,989
and squeezed their parents' fucking heads until they exploded.

313
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,929
Sometimes when a story is so good.

314
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,909
One of our final tales of the evening.

315
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,780
Could I use your printer?

316
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:18,420
This isn't printed out really the way that I want it to.

317
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:21,320
You print me out another copy.

318
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,519
I don't know if this is here for.

319
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:28,469
Doesn't work. Made by HP.

320
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:30,309
Are you sure I can't just, I need to,

321
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,469
if I could just get this printed again.

322
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:39,380
It's okay.

323
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,400
And just tell Jeremy that after the show,

324
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,780
$40 for my usual fee.

325
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,670
I can't use that.

326
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,989
Is this how it works?

327
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,199
Print me out another one that I have a file

328
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:13,880
or that I put on his computer.

329
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,949
I don't know if he has it or not.

330
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:27,349
This next tale is, I think I got it from Reddit.

331
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:30,360
A terrifying tale.

332
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,650
A horror tale.

333
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:43,719
A few years back, I went to my dad's house for Christmas.

334
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,269
My parents are divorced and I rarely go,

335
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:51,989
but my siblings put a lot of pressure on me

336
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,510
so I went.

337
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:58,010
It took about 15 minutes before the stress got to me.

338
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,980
So we all sit down to open presents.

339
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,780
Dad, his new wife, my sibling,

340
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,860
Prezian and my grandmother.

341
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,800
We make it around the circle,

342
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,039
opening presents for about two rounds

343
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,119
before my grandmother gets up and leaves the room.

344
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,690
My father starts fiddling around

345
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,090
waiting for my grandmother to come back

346
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,010
and spot something on the floor.

347
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:28,570
It appears to be cat puke.

348
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:37,099
He asks his wife if it is indeed cat puke.

349
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,780
She had gotten up and followed my grandmother around

350
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,820
and knew the truth.

351
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,380
It was not cat puke.

352
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,099
It was my grandmother's shit.

353
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:52,440
And the lady had shit all over the couch.

354
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,869
It doesn't take long before we can smell the shit

355
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,389
and no amount of air freshener was fixing that.

356
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:05,099
Grandma comes back into the room now

357
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,980
wearing nothing but a blanket around her lower half.

358
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,420
The couch is covered with plastic and towels.

359
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:17,449
My little sister is forced to sit next to my grandmother

360
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,010
and we are all expected to sit nicely

361
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,929
and open more presents

362
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:24,730
while pretending that my grandmother

363
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,730
had not just shit all over the couch.

364
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:32,949
Also the following day my tooth exploded.

365
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,090
Apparently I had an abscess,

366
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,219
but I never felt a thing until it exploded.

367
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,539
TLDR.

368
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,889
Grandma shit on the couch.

369
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,099
What a horrifying story.

370
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,179
What a terrifying tale.

371
00:56:50,820 --> 00:57:08,119
I have one more tale.

372
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:16,820
A tale of a very recent one that came up.

373
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:36,360
The final tale is a recent tale

374
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,760
that I came across in my travels

375
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,320
and I found it to be so bone-chilling,

376
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,159
so absolutely disgraceful and horrible.

377
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,420
For warning to you all watching,

378
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:56,099
this last tale will chill you to your very soul.

379
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:06,980
This tale is called The Sins of Yesteryear.

380
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:29,539
The Sins of Yesteryear.

381
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,150
The winds blow cold this time of year.

382
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:38,389
The true of the snowy icy-filled days

383
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,150
are heartened to blame

384
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,730
and seeing your hot breath

385
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,449
turn to condensed clouds of cold silk.

386
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,809
Now your toes turn to numb rubbers

387
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:52,329
not under the oars,

388
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,550
not the sun-chilling breeze.

389
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,710
I would say.

390
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:05,829
The breezy before-christening job

391
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:07,030
around the neighborhood

392
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,599
to do track and field in high school.

393
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,719
And like stand active.

394
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,320
So I was usually running or walking everywhere.

395
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,519
The route I would typically lead

396
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:23,159
simply through a few side streets in the neighborhood.

397
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,920
Am I supposed to read these?

398
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,039
What is this?

399
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:42,179
When I was like 11,

400
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,420
I really wanted to be an iPod

401
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,300
for Halloween.

402
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,460
So my dad made me a foam rubber iPod costume

403
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,260
complete with speaker mounts

404
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,440
so I could play music while I trick or treat it.

405
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,239
No one wants to be an iPod anymore.

406
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:09,420
Oh, how dastardly.

407
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:19,800
I don't retake.

408
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,809
Ah, scary.

409
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:32,739
Let me go back to what I was saying.

410
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:45,849
That was a little humorous, I will say.

411
01:00:47,929 --> 01:00:50,730
On a breezy before Christmas day,

412
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,210
you know the story was cold

413
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,570
and he got jogging.

414
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:55,929
He's a jogger.

415
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:57,210
He likes to run.

416
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,809
He likes to move around.

417
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:01,449
Okay, sorry.

418
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:09,050
I'm a major creature of habit.

419
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:13,880
Some very odd reason.

420
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,409
I strayed away from my normal routine

421
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:28,550
and it will haunt me until my final day.

422
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,829
I had always heard stories about this person

423
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:35,510
called the loud man.

424
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,269
It was an urban legend in our city

425
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:42,550
and the story is told differently from person to person.

426
01:01:43,269 --> 01:01:46,869
It became a sort of running joke among all of us.

427
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:53,400
Loud laughing, noises, and sometimes faint screams

428
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,960
coming from a certain house

429
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,460
which is what made it so strange.

430
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:04,940
What were these noises and who was making them?

431
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,639
I was never afraid of urban legends

432
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:12,840
and always scoffed at the idea of a boogeyman

433
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,400
or a bigfoot among us

434
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,480
who were hiding in plain sight

435
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,760
waiting for the right time to drain us of our souls.

436
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,050
Oh no, he took me away to another dimension.

437
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,369
I didn't believe any of it.

438
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,300
The idea seems silly until the loud man.

439
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,900
You see, sometimes I take quick breaks during a job.

440
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,880
I check my pulse, make sure my shoes are tied,

441
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,880
nice and tight, catch my breath.

442
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,920
You know, do this thing,

443
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,039
do this thing, or whatever the fuck that is.

444
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:54,500
As I reach down to tighten my shoes

445
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:57,139
is when I heard the sound.

446
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:06,099
Quick, loud, distinguished, a swift thunk, a thunk.

447
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,159
The feeling was immediate.

448
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,219
Breaking bone, bending cold.

449
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:17,579
I thought possibly it may have been a reaction from the jog.

450
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:19,420
Was I moving too fast?

451
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,420
Did I push myself too hard?

452
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,340
No way.

453
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:26,699
It felt as if something entered my body

454
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:28,780
and froze it to its very core.

455
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:33,340
I went to one knee and let the chill dissipate.

456
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,219
The sky opened up at that moment

457
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:39,099
and for the first time in nearly a decade

458
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:43,579
rain started to fall in December.

459
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,199
I quickly brought myself up and checked my surroundings,

460
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,559
my body still aching from the frost in my chest.

461
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:54,119
Finding the rain back as I tried to move,

462
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:57,079
each step more deliberate than the last.

463
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:01,900
Finally, in the pouring rain, I spotted a figure.

464
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:08,039
A figure exiting from the loud man's house.

465
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:13,539
This was just a urban legend.

466
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,099
No one had ever seen anyone come out of that house

467
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:19,380
or near that house.

468
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,380
It was supposed to be abandoned.

469
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:32,099
And then a hunch over small, rail man emerged through the dark.

470
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,500
It was hard to make out through the rain,

471
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:45,300
but he was dragging something or possibly someone.

472
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,389
The faint jingle of bells could be heard

473
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:59,190
with each pull of the oversized sack and the gurgling awful grunts

474
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,269
coming from the loud man's mouth

475
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:05,190
sounded like they were grating through the very gates of hell.

476
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:12,489
I felt I had to do something, but I was frozen in place.

477
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,489
A statue of a man did I turn into.

478
01:05:16,489 --> 01:05:17,369
Should I run?

479
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:18,409
Should I walk?

480
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:19,289
Should I scream?

481
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:21,530
Nothing seemed normal.

482
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,969
Everything seemed out of place.

483
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,489
What felt like an eternity had passed.

484
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,690
I needed to make a move.

485
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:39,639
I put one foot in front of the other and slowly.

486
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,659
Just checking in to make sure your printer works now.

487
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:02,820
We are watching the stream and saw you had difficulties.

488
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,980
Thanks for installing our easy print software.

489
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,260
Thanks to our monitoring agreement,

490
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,300
we will be able to fix it remotely from our end.

491
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,539
Thank you, Jerma985, for choosing DeskJet.

492
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:40,260
Fine, that helped me.

493
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,300
I don't know.

494
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:49,619
The loud man stopped dead in his tracks

495
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:54,920
as I put one foot in front of the other.

496
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,000
He stopped and dropped his bag.

497
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:02,599
His crooked head ripped sideways,

498
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:05,239
tilting over 180 degrees in a second.

499
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:11,239
His eyes lit up red like blood with piercing light skewing through my very being.

500
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:17,130
His jaws started to unhinge

501
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,329
and his mouth opened nearly a foot across.

502
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:31,159
The most unnerving sound I will ever hear.

503
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:40,179
I bolted away.

504
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:44,099
Far out matching any competition I had ever been in.

505
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,780
Street to street, sign to sign.

506
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,500
I ran as far as I could.

507
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,019
I ran within ten minutes.

508
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,019
Here in the distant worlds of the loud man's cries,

509
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:56,900
I ran until the rain dissipated

510
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,940
and the clouds let up

511
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:07,179
and the world seemed at unease.

512
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:21,050
It was very quickly I heard the news.

513
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:25,130
Santa had disappeared.

514
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:31,289
It was on every radio station, every TV channel.

515
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:34,329
You couldn't pass a group of people on the street

516
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:37,930
without some form of conversation playing out

517
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,970
about the recent event of his disappearance.

518
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:44,810
Oh, why?

519
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,810
That was one year ago today.

520
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,840
No one believed my tale.

521
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:57,850
I was seen as a liar, a fraud.

522
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,300
The debate rang out across the globe

523
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,899
on whether or not Santa was even actually real or not.

524
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:11,539
Nations in conflict.

525
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:16,180
Twitter ablaze with confrontations.

526
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,600
And to this day, we're still not so sure.

527
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,899
I've tried to live a normal life

528
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,260
questioning my own sanity

529
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:38,710
and the reality each passing month.

530
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,750
But hear me now.

531
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,939
I still feel those eyes.

532
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:51,060
I still see those shark-fanged teeth.

533
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:53,619
I still hear his scream

534
01:09:53,619 --> 01:09:56,979
and the cold icy touch deep within my bowels.

535
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:01,539
It has not left me since last year.

536
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:14,699
Signed it hard.

537
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,140
Absolutely devilish.

538
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:20,699
I gotta eat this one.

539
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,380
I think I gotta eat this one.

540
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,340
That was a good one.

541
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,180
Found that one real recently.

542
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:33,180
Oh, yeah.

543
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:38,630
Good for joining me on

544
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:47,619
I gotta get my time here.

545
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:51,300
I'm told by Jeremy

546
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,939
that we are going to,

547
01:10:52,939 --> 01:10:55,180
before the present opening ceremony,

548
01:10:55,979 --> 01:10:57,260
we are going to go over

549
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,380
some of his favorite clips

550
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,300
from the past year or three

551
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,939
because it's been a full year.

552
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:06,939
I know it's crazy to think about that.

553
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,779
But I'll see you dastardly fucking dickhead

554
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,810
later.

555
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,800
Enjoy the fucking past year.

556
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,880
So it's all my fucking fault then?

557
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,680
You fucking...

558
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,600
Carol, you fucking...

559
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,640
You're gonna throw me the fucking water?

560
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,000
You're gonna throw me the fucking...

561
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,680
You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.

562
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,640
You know I fucking...

563
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,199
Fuck.

564
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:28,680
Fuck you.

565
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:30,470
I did what I had to.

566
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,189
I fucking...

567
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,340
You can't fucking blame me for that.

568
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,300
Fucking bullshit.

569
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,739
Tell it again, tell it again.

570
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:38,819
Listen, I've told the story like four times.

571
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,420
Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?

572
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:45,380
Stay the fuck away from yard tools.

573
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:47,220
Don't touch anything dangerous.

574
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,420
Don't like rake your leaves.

575
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,300
You're gonna like, duh!

576
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,659
And then all of a sudden you got

577
01:11:50,659 --> 01:11:52,659
$1,400 worth of dentistry wear.

578
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:53,619
Actually can't beat him.

579
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,340
He swings way too weirdly.

580
01:11:57,699 --> 01:12:00,500
And I can't even get the correct controls right.

581
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,699
Shouldn't do R2 twice.

582
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:03,140
Don't even think about it.

583
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:04,979
All right.

584
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:05,779
No, no, no, no, no.

585
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:07,060
Come on.

586
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,460
No, no, no, back up!

587
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,010
No!

588
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:12,510
Oh!

589
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,579
What the fuck?

590
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:17,779
Yikes!

591
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,260
Oh, okay, it's a big guy.

592
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,789
Uh, I don't know what to do.

593
01:12:22,789 --> 01:12:23,430
Holy shit.

594
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,239
This guy.

595
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,520
I gotta jump.

596
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:29,100
And listen to this music that's playing.

597
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:30,699
Oh my god.

598
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:33,180
Sir, you seem to be having a trouble with your car here.

599
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:36,460
Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow...

600
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:38,939
Oh, and I farted!

601
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:39,739
And I farted!

602
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,859
I don't see how people think that's weird.

603
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,890
Why do you think that's weird?

604
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:45,930
You think that's weird that I've never

605
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,369
eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?

606
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,800
I'll get pepperoni for you here.

607
01:12:51,079 --> 01:13:05,319
So it's all my fucking fault then?

608
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:05,640
I didn't mean it.

609
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,439
You fucking...

610
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:07,880
Oh, you fucking...

611
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,319
You're gonna throw me to the fucking wall too?

612
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:10,680
You're gonna fucking throw me to the fucking...

613
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,439
You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.

614
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:13,239
You know I fucking...

615
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:13,960
What the fuck?

616
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,359
Fuck you.

617
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:16,199
I did what I had to!

618
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:16,920
I fucking...

619
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,140
You can't fucking blame me for that.

620
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,100
Fucking bullshit!

621
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,539
Tell it again, tell it again, tell it...

622
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,539
Listen, I've told the story like four times.

623
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,220
Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?

624
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,659
Stay the fuck away from yard tools.

625
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:32,939
Don't touch anything dangerous.

626
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:34,140
Don't like break your leaves.

627
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,020
You're gonna like...

628
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,380
And then all of a sudden you got

629
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,460
1400 dollars worth of dentistry work.

630
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,340
Actually can't beat him.

631
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,060
He swings way too weirdly.

632
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,220
And I can't even get the correct controls right.

633
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,420
Shouldn't do R2 twice.

634
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,859
Don't even think about it.

635
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:50,699
All right.

636
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:51,500
No, no, no, no, no.

637
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:52,779
Come on.

638
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:54,779
No, no, no!

639
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:55,279
Back up!

640
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,310
What the fuck?

641
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:03,510
Yikes!

642
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:05,750
Oh, okay, it's big guy.

643
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:08,579
Uh, I don't know what to do.

644
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:09,220
Holy shit.

645
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,029
This guy.

646
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,229
I gotta jump.

647
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:14,819
And listen to this music that's playing.

648
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,439
Oh my go-

649
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:18,920
Sir, you seem to be having a trouble with your car here.

650
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,199
Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow.

651
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:24,680
Oh, and I farted!

652
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,479
And I farted!

653
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:28,600
I don't see how people think that's weird.

654
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,710
Why do you think that's weird?

655
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,670
You think that's weird that I've never

656
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,109
eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?

657
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,590
I'll get pepperoni for you here.

658
01:14:36,470 --> 01:15:19,659
Let me grab some.

659
01:15:20,539 --> 01:15:21,979
Let me put the mic over here closer.

660
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:24,329
Hold on a second.

661
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:27,350
There we are.

662
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:31,909
There we go.

663
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:32,869
That's a little bit better.

664
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,229
Okay.

665
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,340
So we've got to the present opening portion of the stream.

666
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,659
And if you're curious what the hell this is,

667
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:45,100
a while back the chat talked about how,

668
01:15:45,739 --> 01:15:47,659
you know, oh, let's buy them Pikachu and

669
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:51,020
Pokemon plushies on the internet.

670
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,220
And I thought it was funny.

671
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:54,699
So I said, okay, well, what if we just gave

672
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:57,819
chat a budget to just buy some presents for Christmas?

673
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:00,380
And it was a decent idea, I guess.

674
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,180
People thought it was fun.

675
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:03,020
And that's exactly what happened.

676
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:06,460
I just put up about $400 or so dollars

677
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,739
for chat to suggest presents.

678
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,060
And the mods also suggested presents as well.

679
01:16:12,619 --> 01:16:14,460
I don't know what any of these are.

680
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,380
I have absolutely no idea.

681
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,819
And by the way, don't believe any things

682
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:22,699
you hear from internet scary stories

683
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:24,140
because they're just, none of them are real.

684
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:26,300
And if you think the demons are real,

685
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,380
then you just, I mean, they're made up by,

686
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,859
like, you think the Ghostbusters are real,

687
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:31,579
but they're not.

688
01:16:31,579 --> 01:16:34,300
The Ghostbusters are made up by a handful of guys

689
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,699
who thought it was funny to make ghost stories and shit.

690
01:16:36,699 --> 01:16:39,180
But he's gone.

691
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,340
I made sure he got paid and he's gone.

692
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,500
So just don't believe anything you hear on the internet

693
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,939
because the internet's obviously fucked up.

694
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:49,260
They don't really fucking believe anything on the internet.

695
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,100
So I don't know what any of these are.

696
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,539
I have Kim Raptum and Italics,

697
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,180
my wonderful tech director here,

698
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,300
has bought them under my Amazon.

699
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,500
So I have no idea what they are.

700
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,500
And we also, by the way,

701
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,460
we have the Christmas Magical Facts Machine.

702
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,220
So if you do have something to say,

703
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:12,380
it's going to be printed out here.

704
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,060
If you give a bit donation,

705
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,420
it's going to be printed out here.

706
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:19,560
Probably. Maybe.

707
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,239
I don't know if it fucking works.

708
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:23,159
But let's get started.

709
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,640
So there are, I think, 20-something gifts.

710
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,319
And I want to make this very clear

711
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,079
because I think maybe some people don't know

712
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,279
what's going to happen at the end of this.

713
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:35,399
If there are things in here that I'm not going to use

714
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:39,560
or if there are things that I think are not worth

715
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,319
maybe me keeping long term,

716
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:43,000
if there's some things that might,

717
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,920
maybe some of the family or some of the person

718
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,079
might get better use of a toy or something,

719
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:51,079
then that with the train as well

720
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:53,720
is going to go to a donation circle.

721
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,239
So we'll see.

722
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,239
I might just keep some of this shit.

723
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:57,880
We'll find out.

724
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,920
So the first one we're going to open,

725
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,039
and this is not like a bit, by the way,

726
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:03,479
like the last couple things with bits.

727
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:06,199
But, you know, this is not a joke.

728
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:07,319
I don't know what the fuck is in here.

729
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,159
So let's go and open this one.

730
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:10,520
This is the first present we're going to open.

731
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,859
I don't know what it is.

732
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,460
And it's like, we're like, oh, yeah,

733
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,060
there's like a few hundred dollars

734
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,859
to like buy me presents from my own stream.

735
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:19,899
It's like a little weird,

736
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:22,460
but it's just an unboxing kind of thing.

737
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,420
I thought it was fun.

738
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:29,380
And this is called, this is the nut button.

739
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,180
Okay.

740
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:33,670
I already can't wait to know what this is.

741
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:36,069
This is the first thing I open

742
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:44,100
and this is this fucking stupid thing.

743
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:49,689
What the hell am I going to, I can't donate this.

744
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:51,689
What am I going to do with this?

745
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:58,020
There is no use for this item.

746
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:01,659
It doesn't serve any purpose, not one.

747
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:07,050
Can I melt this plastic down

748
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,649
and turn it into like fucking water bottles?

749
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:13,130
That's all it does.

750
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:16,939
Oh yeah.

751
01:19:16,939 --> 01:19:18,220
Oh, by the way, guys,

752
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,779
I'm going to donate most of the items here

753
01:19:20,779 --> 01:19:22,380
to families in the, oh yeah.

754
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,069
Yeah. Let me dump.

755
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,479
I don't know what I'm going to do with this.

756
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:29,850
There's the nut button.

757
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,130
That's the first item.

758
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,489
Okay. We're going to go small for now.

759
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:33,609
I knocked it over.

760
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:34,409
Let's go with this one.

761
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,079
It's a Garfield costume.

762
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,279
I know what this is already.

763
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:43,260
This is a fucking Garfield.

764
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,100
I know it's a Garfield costume

765
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,300
and I'm just going to open it

766
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,500
because I know exactly what it is.

767
01:19:58,859 --> 01:19:59,579
Captain Morgan,

768
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:01,659
I want to see the Grifters basketballs.

769
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:08,420
I don't have time for that.

770
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:10,420
What? Captain Morgan says,

771
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,100
I want to see the Grifters basketballs.

772
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:15,239
Frodingweapon says,

773
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,720
can you tell Ninja to stream on Christmas?

774
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,380
I don't know Ninja.

775
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,340
I don't talk to him.

776
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:25,840
What?

777
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,390
Thank you, Cobra Cat, by the way.

778
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,590
Best Christmas to be honest.

779
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:30,390
Hashtag charity.

780
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,510
Thanks for the charity, by the way.

781
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,229
There's the Christmas fucking fax machine

782
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,510
coming out here with some weird shit.

783
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:37,109
Here's the Garfield.

784
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:38,630
Oh, put it on.

785
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:39,750
Is everybody saying put it on?

786
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,930
Is that what they're saying?

787
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:43,770
I fucking knew what it was

788
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,729
when I saw it in the back.

789
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,779
What are they saying?

790
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,210
Yeah. Put it on.

791
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:59,270
I don't want to do that.

792
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,390
Like, I can't,

793
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,310
how am I going to donate the shit?

794
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,220
Hey, by the way,

795
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,819
you want a Garfield costume?

796
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:08,819
No, I'm not putting this on.

797
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:09,319
Okay?

798
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:59,500
If that was fun, let's get it off.

799
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,710
I'm sorry, Mom.

800
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,430
I'm sorry, Mom.

801
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:09,670
Mom is like watching the stream

802
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,390
and she's probably like,

803
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:11,909
what the fuck is my son doing?

804
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,350
So this is gift number three.

805
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,819
Again, I don't know what these are

806
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:21,029
and we'll find out.

807
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,229
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me.

808
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:29,670
I talked about this like the other,

809
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,270
like not even two weeks ago.

810
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:34,100
This is an Airzooka.

811
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,300
You got to shoot me in the fucking face

812
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:35,779
with this thing.

813
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,479
I'm serious.

814
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:44,819
Airzooka.

815
01:22:49,289 --> 01:22:50,489
These things are so awesome.

816
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:51,770
You can, like from a mile away,

817
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,810
you can hit somebody right in the face.

818
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:54,329
You'll see the air.

819
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:57,579
Oh, I can't, I can't wait

820
01:22:57,579 --> 01:22:59,100
to like donate this.

821
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,140
Someone's going to have so much

822
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,020
fucking fun with this thing.

823
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:01,520
Seriously.

824
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:13,180
HowToPrinters is the great Canadian

825
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:13,899
with $50.

826
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,060
That's how.

827
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:21,390
Fuck.

828
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:26,390
Thank you from zero two for the $10.

829
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,989
Hey, Jerma, my name is Lucy

830
01:23:27,989 --> 01:23:29,590
and your streams make me smile so much.

831
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:32,310
I made Jerma remix 10 for green screen night

832
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:33,750
and I felt so proud when it was shown.

833
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,789
This community is so great.

834
01:23:34,789 --> 01:23:35,430
Thanks for the laughs.

835
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,149
Happy holidays.

836
01:23:36,869 --> 01:23:37,909
Happy fucking day.

837
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:39,750
Edgemont, thanks for the $50.

838
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,189
Your fax machine is broken.

839
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:43,510
The thing is this thing sucks, okay?

840
01:23:44,069 --> 01:23:45,109
You want to know why the stream

841
01:23:45,109 --> 01:23:46,550
was like an hour late?

842
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:47,909
Because we were trying to figure out

843
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:48,949
so desperately how to get,

844
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:50,949
how to get this fucking thing to work.

845
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:53,430
It is a basic HP printer

846
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:56,380
that's plugged in with USB.

847
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,500
Oh my goodness.

848
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,779
Was it a fucking pain in the ass?

849
01:24:00,489 --> 01:24:03,100
But help, I'm trapped in the printer.

850
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,859
It says Spartan cat.

851
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:05,979
Well, you're out here now.

852
01:24:05,979 --> 01:24:07,430
You're out now.

853
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:11,579
And Airzooka, if you don't know,

854
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,399
is a device.

855
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:16,779
I don't have to read the rules.

856
01:24:16,779 --> 01:24:18,619
So you pull on one end.

857
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:19,420
I'm going to shoot it out.

858
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:19,979
It's right in the face.

859
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:20,479
Watch this.

860
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,670
Make sure I box this up nice

861
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:25,189
because this is fucking awesome.

862
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,670
Awesome.

863
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:31,619
Whoa, this piece is here.

864
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:32,100
Yep.

865
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,539
So you pull back on this

866
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:34,819
and it gives a bunch of air pressure

867
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:35,220
forward.

868
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:46,420
So, hey, you're going to tell me

869
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,460
if this hits you like right in the face.

870
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,770
I used to be really good at this shit.

871
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:55,699
Can I take the Garfield costume off?

872
01:24:55,699 --> 01:24:58,300
Like, can I?

873
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,420
That's like, that's funny, right?

874
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,220
If it's off.

875
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,149
It has to stay on.

876
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,949
It has to stay on.

877
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:04,949
I really-

878
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:07,529
You're going to lose viewers.

879
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:08,649
Is it weird that I don't care?

880
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:15,000
I want to get the Garfield fucking costume

881
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,880
off of my body.

882
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:20,550
You're going to lose viewers.

883
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,789
But the Garfield costume

884
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:23,909
gets to come off.

885
01:25:23,909 --> 01:25:25,189
So that's like a plus.

886
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:26,789
So here's this part.

887
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:33,210
I could snipe people away from so far.

888
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:33,930
All right, hold on.

889
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,369
Let me get this connected here.

890
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:36,329
How the fuck is this?

891
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:37,770
Is there instructions with this?

892
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,630
Okay, here's the button.

893
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:49,590
I got to plug it in here.

894
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:49,989
Okay.

895
01:25:50,789 --> 01:25:51,750
Dude, check this out.

896
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,029
I want-

897
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:53,989
I'm serious, dude.

898
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:55,029
I want you to stand across

899
01:25:55,029 --> 01:25:55,829
the whole entire studio

900
01:25:55,829 --> 01:25:56,710
and I want you to shoot me

901
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,829
in the fucking face with this.

902
01:25:58,869 --> 01:25:59,989
People think this is a joke,

903
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:03,539
but this is the real deal.

904
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,220
Does that connect like that?

905
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:08,869
Do I actually need these fucking instructions?

906
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,210
Did I put it on wrong?

907
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:29,829
Did I put it on wrong?

908
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:35,829
I think I put it on wrong.

909
01:26:35,829 --> 01:26:38,039
All right.

910
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,239
Hey, can you like figure this out?

911
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,199
Can you like fucking-

912
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:44,680
Well, because it's like too hard.

913
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,920
It's too hard for my fucking tiny brain.

914
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,520
Just read the instructions

915
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:52,279
and figure out how to shoot.

916
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,199
I have the trigger on the wrong way.

917
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:54,520
All right.

918
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,640
Airzooka.

919
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,760
That's a lot of fun.

920
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,000
I can't wait to get fucking in the face.

921
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,420
Remember that one?

922
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:11,340
Pile over there.

923
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:11,659
All right.

924
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:12,140
Next one.

925
01:27:13,659 --> 01:27:14,300
I'm sorry.

926
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:15,579
Damn.

927
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:16,619
All right.

928
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:17,260
Here's another one.

929
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:20,569
So again, this is just an-

930
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,050
I already-

931
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,489
I explained it like four times.

932
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:32,310
What is this?

933
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,979
Five pound box of assorted misprint

934
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:46,939
rackable office big bulk lot.

935
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,180
What the fuck does that even mean?

936
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:53,899
I don't know what that means.

937
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:58,680
That's a long sentence.

938
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:06,229
What am I gonna-

939
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:09,590
What am I gonna do with this many fucking-

940
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:11,109
It's pens.

941
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:12,069
Why?

942
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,670
Oh my god.

943
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:13,989
Okay.

944
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:20,579
Is this-

945
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:25,000
These are pretty-

946
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,199
Actually pretty cool.

947
01:28:26,199 --> 01:28:26,520
All right.

948
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:26,920
Hold on.

949
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,439
Liberty Tools from the Bronx.

950
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:34,729
It's like 500 pens.

951
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:43,750
I'm gonna take like three of these and store them.

952
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,670
And I gotta like-

953
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,789
What am I gonna fucking do with these?

954
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,789
I'm gonna have to donate them or send them somewhere.

955
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,350
Jesus Christ.

956
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:53,109
Well, that's really funny.

957
01:28:57,909 --> 01:28:58,630
What is this?

958
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:02,779
This is from Nationwide Insurance.

959
01:29:05,979 --> 01:29:07,579
Who packaged this shit?

960
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,260
That's what I want to know.

961
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:13,590
Somebody had to put these all into a box.

962
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:18,819
What like weird pen company are you?

963
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:21,260
This is like a misprint.

964
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:22,859
Oh, yeah, yeah.

965
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:23,579
I'm gonna like-

966
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:25,579
I'm gonna take a trip to like a bunch of law offices

967
01:29:25,579 --> 01:29:25,899
and be like,

968
01:29:25,899 --> 01:29:27,020
I want some fucking pens.

969
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,850
Well, thank you for the pens,

970
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,970
whoever suggested that.

971
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:32,489
That's good stuff.

972
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:34,619
Get this one.

973
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,539
You still trying to figure out the air, Zuka?

974
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:41,340
Get this off.

975
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,979
You're gonna have to like hire some more help for this one.

976
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:47,590
Is my hair all fucked up?

977
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:53,319
What is in here?

978
01:29:53,319 --> 01:30:06,060
It's the Bitcoin Inner Gnome.

979
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:10,439
11 inches high gnome statue.

980
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,239
Exclusively designed by Joystick.

981
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:15,720
Hand painted with exquisite details.

982
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,880
Funny Bitcoin good luck charm.

983
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,479
Great for indoor and outdoor use.

984
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:24,359
This is gonna have to go on my desk.

985
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:25,159
It's not gonna happen.

986
01:30:27,159 --> 01:30:28,119
Oh, God.

987
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,840
I have to see what it looks like.

988
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,880
I need to know what it looks like.

989
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:43,180
Fucking Bitcoin.

990
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:47,140
I haven't talked about Bitcoin in like seven months.

991
01:31:05,989 --> 01:31:07,510
This thing sucks.

992
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,750
This sucks, okay?

993
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:11,050
I-

994
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:18,409
There you go.

995
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,659
This doesn't go in your-

996
01:31:25,659 --> 01:31:26,939
Do you put this in your front lawn?

997
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,060
Is that what it's designed for?

998
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,899
I have no idea where this goes.

999
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:34,500
Do you put this like on your kitchen counter?

1000
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:37,289
Why would you own this?

1001
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:41,050
Hey, remember that thing I bought that dropped 75% in value?

1002
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:46,409
This must have been a product that was sold like 11 months ago

1003
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:47,289
and people thought it was cool.

1004
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:50,819
Well, I'm gonna have to-

1005
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:52,180
I'll just put it on my mantle.

1006
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:57,659
All right, what's next?

1007
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,979
I got some fucking trash.

1008
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,659
Can you grab like a trash box?

1009
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,819
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1010
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:08,680
This one's heavy.

1011
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:30,220
This is the walkeroo stilts.

1012
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,859
Easy walking handheld stilts.

1013
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:41,460
That's really, really funny.

1014
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:48,569
Oh, great.

1015
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,920
Yeah, let me like put these on and pretend I'm fucking 6'4".

1016
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:56,140
I can't even.

1017
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,520
Why do they have to have like children on here?

1018
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,279
That just makes it so much worse.

1019
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:03,560
Yeah, I'll just throw it in there.

1020
01:33:05,619 --> 01:33:06,260
Walkeroo.

1021
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,220
I'm not even gonna be able to reach these.

1022
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,859
We're gonna have to cut to the other camera while I-

1023
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:19,350
Are you still figuring out the bazooka?

1024
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:21,590
It's got four pages of instruction.

1025
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:26,779
Who would have thought that it would be that hard?

1026
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:28,760
Oh, my God.

1027
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:32,649
Hey, Merry fucking Christmas and happy holidays to you.

1028
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:34,649
How bad is my hair look?

1029
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:36,890
Be honest with me, dude.

1030
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:37,609
Like be real.

1031
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:38,489
I want you to be honest.

1032
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:42,010
Like, should I put like something on?

1033
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,050
Should I put the hat back on?

1034
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:45,210
The car feels like a bad one.

1035
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,890
But I'd rather look terrible.

1036
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,739
Look, I can't.

1037
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:52,779
I'll open that later.

1038
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:54,619
Look at all this shit.

1039
01:33:55,819 --> 01:34:00,100
What am I gonna do with the pens?

1040
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,239
I'll do this later at the end of the stream.

1041
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:09,640
All right, oh, we got some more.

1042
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:15,619
There's a stocking here.

1043
01:34:15,619 --> 01:34:16,819
Let's go ahead and open the stocking.

1044
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:27,140
Why not?

1045
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:29,220
There's a single earbud.

1046
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:37,060
Is this because-

1047
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:40,979
So I get this one.

1048
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:41,859
I actually do get it.

1049
01:34:42,819 --> 01:34:44,899
A single earbud.

1050
01:34:44,899 --> 01:34:47,300
That was my favorite one.

1051
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:53,539
Because, I mean, it's pretty comfortable.

1052
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,939
Okay, for those of you that have no fucking idea what this is,

1053
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:12,460
I can't wear two headphones because I'm fucking strange.

1054
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,939
And when I have two headphones in,

1055
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:17,579
it causes me all kinds of distraction and stress.

1056
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,699
And it closes me off in the whole world and I feel weird.

1057
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:23,659
So thanks for the one earbud.

1058
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:26,579
Do I get stereo from here?

1059
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:27,939
Can I get stereo sound from this?

1060
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:36,789
I'm actually gonna use that.

1061
01:35:36,789 --> 01:35:37,989
I'm actually gonna use that one.

1062
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:42,819
Hey, how's that Airzooka doing over there?

1063
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:45,369
What else is in the stocking?

1064
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:56,439
I don't know what this is.

1065
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:57,420
What is this?

1066
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:07,479
This is black gloves?

1067
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:11,100
What's the joke?

1068
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:12,539
I don't understand.

1069
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:15,899
Why, I don't, why, what's the joke here?

1070
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:19,180
It's just long black leather gloves.

1071
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:25,029
I feel care instructions.

1072
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:27,829
Hand wash, do not wring, do not tumble dry.

1073
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,979
Is this a sex thing?

1074
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:33,109
Hey, is this a sex thing?

1075
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:33,430
You know?

1076
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,100
I said no sex things.

1077
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:40,739
I don't think I can answer that question.

1078
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:45,260
I can't even fit my fucking hands in here.

1079
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:45,579
What?

1080
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:51,060
Is this handle long?

1081
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:51,619
Yes.

1082
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:53,640
That's why I can't figure it out.

1083
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,319
What is fucking going on here?

1084
01:36:56,039 --> 01:36:57,159
Oh, those are for your feet.

1085
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,300
Are you sure?

1086
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,500
Oh yeah, they're for your feet.

1087
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,869
No, they're not.

1088
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:05,510
They're gloves.

1089
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:06,470
Those are for your feet.

1090
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:08,310
No, there's a hand.

1091
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,789
I'm not taking my fucking socks off.

1092
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:14,869
You can't see your feet right now.

1093
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:18,869
Are you sure these aren't just weird gloves?

1094
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,989
They're gloves for your feet.

1095
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:24,390
Why would somebody wear these?

1096
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:29,289
One, two, three, four, five.

1097
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:37,079
Don't look at me.

1098
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,140
Don't put your feet up there.

1099
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,279
Are you talking shit or is this for real?

1100
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,800
I'm serious.

1101
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,239
I put this on my feet.

1102
01:37:47,239 --> 01:37:51,100
Yeah, that's what the gift is.

1103
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,119
It's foot leather gloves.

1104
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:55,479
Amazon Prime, baby.

1105
01:37:56,279 --> 01:37:57,319
Foot leather gloves.

1106
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:02,920
I just don't, I don't understand it.

1107
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:06,409
Okay.

1108
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:14,569
You weren't supposed to put the handle on.

1109
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:17,130
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1110
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:21,210
I've seen a lot of dumb shit in my whole life.

1111
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,890
And honestly, I went to fireworks one time.

1112
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:27,369
I went to the fireworks show when I was probably 14.

1113
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:31,130
And they did like four fireworks and it ended the show.

1114
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:31,930
And I said to myself,

1115
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:33,449
I'll never see anything stupider than this.

1116
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:34,170
Never in my life.

1117
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:35,850
I have now.

1118
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,369
This is the worst thing I've ever put on my body.

1119
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:40,970
It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1120
01:38:43,029 --> 01:38:44,229
You did the Airzooka.

1121
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:45,350
You broke it.

1122
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:46,310
I broke the Airzooka.

1123
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:49,029
You weren't supposed to put the handle on here.

1124
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:50,149
Take the handle off.

1125
01:38:50,149 --> 01:38:52,710
You take the handle off with your feet or something.

1126
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,390
You've got good grip down there.

1127
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,670
I don't, who would ever put these on?

1128
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,510
I gotta move on because I can't handle this.

1129
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:04,149
Don't, you're gonna, don't throw it to me.

1130
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,619
All right, here, this is another gift.

1131
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:13,909
Wow, that was explosive.

1132
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,720
Maybe there's like feet in here.

1133
01:39:22,279 --> 01:39:37,399
Banana award.

1134
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:45,260
All that's in here is this top banana award.

1135
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:48,649
How much was this, do you know?

1136
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:52,789
I know this is like 30.

1137
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:54,390
There's at least 10 in here.

1138
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:57,989
I don't even show them all.

1139
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:08,520
How many top bananas can there possibly be?

1140
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:11,909
Isn't there only one top banana?

1141
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:13,829
That doesn't make any sense.

1142
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:23,539
I'll keep one because I'm the top banana.

1143
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:24,659
I got the top banana.

1144
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:40,439
That sounded wrong, but what else is in the stocking?

1145
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:41,239
Let's find out.

1146
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:42,680
Okay, oh, look at this.

1147
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,039
It's blue and what's in it?

1148
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:46,039
Ooh, a sex thing.

1149
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,039
This is called the Ubing.

1150
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:50,039
Enjoy shopping.

1151
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:52,199
This has got a kind of a fucked up,

1152
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:55,239
like grayed out, blacked out kind of case.

1153
01:40:56,949 --> 01:40:57,829
This is a sex thing.

1154
01:40:57,829 --> 01:41:07,859
I know it.

1155
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:08,899
No, this is cool.

1156
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:09,859
I would actually wear this.

1157
01:41:10,579 --> 01:41:11,380
This is actually kind of cool.

1158
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:14,119
I'll wear this.

1159
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:16,489
You guys think it's a joke.

1160
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:19,529
I'm going to actually wear this like on a daily basis.

1161
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:21,850
It's got aeration.

1162
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:22,890
It's got plenty of air.

1163
01:41:23,449 --> 01:41:27,829
I don't like what a daily basis.

1164
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:29,800
What's wrong with that?

1165
01:41:30,939 --> 01:41:33,399
It's got breatheable.

1166
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:36,649
It's I actually kind of like this.

1167
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:39,050
This is sex thing.

1168
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:39,770
Let's find out.

1169
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:47,449
It's just a nice tank top.

1170
01:41:47,449 --> 01:41:52,329
You got to go full Garfield or full no Garfield?

1171
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:54,710
Not working.

1172
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:56,149
Says who though?

1173
01:42:14,899 --> 01:42:15,300
Hold on.

1174
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,300
Let me use my like my like foot grip.

1175
01:42:21,979 --> 01:42:23,100
I knew this was going to happen.

1176
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:23,819
Didn't I tell you that?

1177
01:42:23,819 --> 01:42:24,939
Didn't I tell you that one of the things

1178
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:26,619
was going to be a Garfield costume?

1179
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:27,579
I was certain.

1180
01:42:27,579 --> 01:42:31,399
It's funny that that was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1181
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:32,279
Are you sure?

1182
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:34,840
Yeah, I didn't make the original list.

1183
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:40,090
Yeah, but I just knew that there was going

1184
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:41,850
to be a Garfield costume in here.

1185
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:44,090
But if you hadn't have told me that

1186
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:45,770
there wasn't going to be one.

1187
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,810
No, but there was.

1188
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:47,850
There always will be.

1189
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:48,970
All right.

1190
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:50,170
Has that does that look like I'm going?

1191
01:42:51,449 --> 01:42:54,260
Dude, my fly was down in the first

1192
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:55,539
fucking 10 seconds of the stream.

1193
01:42:56,739 --> 01:42:58,579
I'm talking that was like a triple fly.

1194
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:02,739
That conductor outfit had a like quad fly.

1195
01:43:02,739 --> 01:43:04,420
It was like from here to here.

1196
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:07,819
So can I be embarrassed anymore on the stream?

1197
01:43:07,819 --> 01:43:08,460
I don't think so.

1198
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,380
Thanks for the sex thing.

1199
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,220
Whoever suggested that.

1200
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:13,829
All right.

1201
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:14,550
What else is in here?

1202
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:17,909
This feels like clay.

1203
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:31,020
Is this like a dick?

1204
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:32,779
This is like a hairy dick.

1205
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:34,779
I thought I said no like dicks.

1206
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,819
This is not a hairy dick.

1207
01:43:37,819 --> 01:43:38,140
No.

1208
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,100
Are you sure?

1209
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:39,500
Yeah.

1210
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,699
If I open this on streaming,

1211
01:43:40,699 --> 01:43:42,060
this is like a big hairy cock.

1212
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,420
I'm going to be fucking really mad.

1213
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,180
It's a fanny pack.

1214
01:43:50,199 --> 01:43:51,560
No, that's a big dick.

1215
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:53,880
That's not a fanny pack.

1216
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,159
Horizontal.

1217
01:43:55,159 --> 01:44:02,039
I hate this.

1218
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:07,560
This is like a fucking hairy cock.

1219
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:12,619
I swear to God.

1220
01:44:12,619 --> 01:44:15,130
I'm not going to win.

1221
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:19,800
Oh yeah.

1222
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,439
Top banana.

1223
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:21,560
That's fucking great.

1224
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,840
Oh, by the way, all these gifts are going to charity.

1225
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:28,409
Can't wait to send top banana.

1226
01:44:28,409 --> 01:44:28,890
I can't.

1227
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:30,779
Oh yeah.

1228
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:31,020
What?

1229
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,859
Like you want like a dad dick?

1230
01:44:32,859 --> 01:44:33,340
Yeah.

1231
01:44:33,899 --> 01:44:36,220
Give me a break.

1232
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:41,399
Whatever.

1233
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:42,119
I'm just going to wear it.

1234
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,300
I thought it was going to be like toys.

1235
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:48,260
All right.

1236
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:48,979
Let's keep going.

1237
01:44:48,979 --> 01:44:50,420
What else is in the sack?

1238
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:53,699
No.

1239
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:55,619
There's nothing in the sack, Jeremy.

1240
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,579
Just some Christmas spirit.

1241
01:44:58,579 --> 01:44:59,220
Here's my voice.

1242
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,420
It's still like something high.

1243
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:07,180
Is there anything else in there, Mr. Saka?

1244
01:45:09,739 --> 01:45:10,699
No, Jeremy.

1245
01:45:10,699 --> 01:45:13,109
Take a hear his Christmas spirit.

1246
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:16,949
No, don't kiss him.

1247
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:21,930
A bag gift.

1248
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:24,500
A bag present.

1249
01:45:27,899 --> 01:45:28,539
What?

1250
01:45:28,539 --> 01:45:31,189
Why are you laughing so hard over there?

1251
01:45:32,489 --> 01:45:32,810
What?

1252
01:45:34,819 --> 01:45:36,899
He's laughing really hard.

1253
01:45:36,979 --> 01:45:40,279
I don't know why.

1254
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:41,640
He's fucking cracking up.

1255
01:45:42,279 --> 01:45:44,920
And I can't figure it out for the life of me.

1256
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:45,239
All right.

1257
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:46,279
What do we got here?

1258
01:45:46,279 --> 01:45:48,520
Oh, hey, there's a turkey.

1259
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,479
Oh, it's a seagull.

1260
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:50,680
That's actually really nice.

1261
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,720
Nice job, everybody.

1262
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:56,600
Nice work.

1263
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,159
Why?

1264
01:45:57,159 --> 01:45:58,439
Why is this so funny?

1265
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:01,270
You can't hide it.

1266
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:02,760
I will.

1267
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,399
This is great.

1268
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:04,119
I actually like this.

1269
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:04,840
This is auto.

1270
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,560
We'll play with this.

1271
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,800
It's a nice seagull.

1272
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:08,359
We've saved up.

1273
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:08,600
You know what?

1274
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,960
We saved up with 50,000 seagulls.

1275
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,359
You know that?

1276
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:12,619
He doesn't give a shit.

1277
01:46:12,619 --> 01:46:13,420
He's like laughing at it.

1278
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:15,659
He put on a fucked up filter on my voice.

1279
01:46:18,619 --> 01:46:19,180
I guarantee you.

1280
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:19,899
That's what happened, right?

1281
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,029
What is this?

1282
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,350
Is this for a baby?

1283
01:46:41,859 --> 01:46:42,739
Oh, I know.

1284
01:46:42,739 --> 01:46:44,260
I think this is a dog costume.

1285
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,579
Is this a dog costume?

1286
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,890
This is a Pepe the Frog dog costume.

1287
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:54,090
Auto is not going to fit in this.

1288
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,050
He's way too big.

1289
01:46:56,329 --> 01:46:57,770
Yeah, there's no way he's going to fit.

1290
01:46:57,770 --> 01:46:59,050
Maybe your dog can fit in this.

1291
01:46:59,050 --> 01:46:59,850
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1292
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:00,729
I got you a gift for you.

1293
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:04,170
Hey, you want a sex thing too?

1294
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,770
Hey, heads up.

1295
01:47:09,369 --> 01:47:12,010
Okay, which one's the sex thing?

1296
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,449
No, the frog is not here.

1297
01:47:14,979 --> 01:47:17,539
Hey, I just don't want to fuck up the computer.

1298
01:47:17,539 --> 01:47:19,380
All right, sex thing.

1299
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:19,779
Never mind.

1300
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:22,500
Anybody in there?

1301
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:27,399
You know how much I'm a pain in the ass.

1302
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:29,399
Let's try to get this fucking thing to work.

1303
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:31,239
Oh, I went about to just put my hand through it.

1304
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:36,789
This is officially licensed stuff.

1305
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:37,289
Okay.

1306
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:40,659
I thought this was some knockoff.

1307
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:54,390
Oh, lunch meal.

1308
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:55,270
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

1309
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:58,069
Hey, man, I was originally going to write some dumb chat meme here,

1310
01:47:58,069 --> 01:47:59,109
but in the spirit of Christmas,

1311
01:47:59,109 --> 01:48:02,310
I'd be more incisive to say that you have the funniest guy on this platform

1312
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:03,989
and that's all that's there.

1313
01:48:03,989 --> 01:48:07,750
Guess who got cut off by this fantastic HP computer.

1314
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:10,810
Oh, let me get there with my...

1315
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:14,970
Okay, you know like in Breaking Bad?

1316
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:16,409
No, what's the Adam Sandlin movie?

1317
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:19,109
Where the guy is like the fucking foot.

1318
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,789
Funniest guy on the platform.

1319
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:26,789
I'm sure half the times I've ever laughed my whole life

1320
01:48:26,789 --> 01:48:27,989
has been because of you.

1321
01:48:27,989 --> 01:48:29,189
You deserve all the support you get.

1322
01:48:29,189 --> 01:48:30,149
Man, cheers and happy holidays.

1323
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:30,869
Hashtag charity.

1324
01:48:30,869 --> 01:48:32,310
Thank you, lunch meals.

1325
01:48:35,829 --> 01:48:38,390
Yo, Merry Christmas says you have a smoke-wise ganja.

1326
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,949
Thanks a lot.

15 bucks.

1329
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:42,149
Hi, Jeremy.

1331
01:48:42,869 --> 01:48:43,750
Thanks for the rand-wraps.

1332
01:48:44,789 --> 01:48:45,909
Hey, Jeremy, happy holidays.

1333
01:48:45,909 --> 01:48:49,430
You're one of the few reasons I have as to why my depression is less than so much

1334
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:50,069
since high school.

1335
01:48:50,069 --> 01:48:51,430
Keep me an amazing hashtag charity.

1336
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:51,829
Thank you.

1337
01:48:52,789 --> 01:48:53,829
I'm glad you're feeling better.

And then Freudian Weapon for $10.

1339
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:58,149
This stream is the best Christmas gift I could have hoped for.

1340
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:00,069
Thank you so much and Merry Christmas.

1341
01:49:00,069 --> 01:49:00,869
Hashtag charity.

1342
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:02,710

Thank you all.

1344

And thank you to the HP $30 at Walmart fucking machine.

1345
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,189
All right, what is this?

1346
01:49:09,989 --> 01:49:10,710
I don't want to open that.

1347
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:11,430
I'm not opening that one.

1348
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:12,149
You can open that one.

1349
01:49:12,949 --> 01:49:16,069
I saw like a fucking bug, a scorpion, and I'm not touching it.

1350
01:49:16,869 --> 01:49:18,470
There's like a bug in that one.

1351
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,670
I said no bugs.

1352
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:21,350
I said no fucking live animals.

1353
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:25,590
I said no fucking, I'm not, I saw the scorpion and I don't want to touch it.

1354
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:27,270
Is there a scorpion in there?

1355
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,909
You got to be, I don't want to fucking touch this.

1356
01:49:33,909 --> 01:49:39,829
Is there a fucking scorpion in here?

1357
01:49:39,829 --> 01:49:40,630
Glow in the dark.

1358
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:43,670
Genuine giant wasp hornet.

1359
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:50,840
I can't, I don't think I can fucking do it.

1360
01:49:51,479 --> 01:49:52,439
I'm not even kidding.

1361
01:49:55,079 --> 01:49:56,119
Is that coming up on screen?

1362
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,840
Is this a real thing?

1363
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:00,300
Is this for real?

1364
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:03,640
Oh my fucking God.

1365
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,600
I can't do it.

1366
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:13,159
I, you do it.

1367
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,000
I can't do it.

1368
01:50:21,079 --> 01:50:21,880
I can't do it.

1369
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,159
Is that real?

1370
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:27,640
Is that a real fucking thing?

1371
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:33,109
Oh God, why would somebody want that in their house?

1372
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:35,670
How are you, how are you touching that?

1373
01:50:37,829 --> 01:50:39,590
Don't open it, don't actually open it.

1374
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,680
Hold on, it's an Angelina Jolie blood pendant?

1375
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,199
Is it really?

1376
01:50:55,850 --> 01:51:04,390
It's a Billy Bob Thornton blood pendant thing.

1377
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:16,840
Jesus Christ, how could you fucking, it's touching my face.

1378
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,640
Hold on, wait, how do I put this on my neck?

1379
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:25,590
Did they get like a, get a good view of that?

1380
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:28,729
Fucked up.

1381
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:34,539
That's real.

1382
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,979
In you want it, it's genuine.

1383
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:50,149
That's fucked up.

1384
01:51:50,149 --> 01:51:51,189
I can't fucking handle that.

1385
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:54,310
I think breaks it, it's gonna get out.

1386
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:55,590
It's gonna kill everybody.

1387
01:51:58,649 --> 01:51:59,609
That's it for the stocking.

1388
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,529
I thought it was a scorpion.

1389
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,640
All right, here we go.

1390
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,119
What's this?

1391
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,489
Thank you.

1392
01:52:11,369 --> 01:52:12,890
I was gonna buy these anyways.

1393
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:14,810
These are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1394
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:17,289
insulated hard spout cups.

1395
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:19,050
These are sippy cups

1396
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:21,449
because I spill things all the time

1397
01:52:21,449 --> 01:52:22,890
and it's not embarrassing.

1398
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:25,539
Look, there's two here.

1399
01:52:25,539 --> 01:52:26,260
You can have one of these.

1400
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:28,100
You know how many times you've,

1401
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,340
how many times have you dropped like a coffee

1402
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:31,779
on your desk?

1403
01:52:32,819 --> 01:52:33,140
Never.

1404
01:52:38,329 --> 01:52:38,810
Well, I have.

1405
01:52:39,859 --> 01:52:42,100
And this is, this prevents spills.

1406
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:44,979
This stops bullshit from coming out of your glass.

1407
01:52:45,539 --> 01:52:47,460
You're not gonna, I will actually use these.

1408
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:49,220
This is another one of those.

1409
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:49,859
I'm not even kidding.

1410
01:52:49,859 --> 01:52:50,659
I gotta get out of here.

1411
01:52:50,659 --> 01:52:51,380
I gotta go.

1412
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,500
This is one of those scenarios.

1413
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,539
I'm gonna actually use these.

1414
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:56,500
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sippy cups.

1415
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:59,460
I put coffee in these.

1416
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:00,100
Like, fuck it.

1417
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,260
I'm keeping those.

1418
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:04,260
All right, we got some more.

1419
01:53:05,539 --> 01:53:09,140
This is, oh, I hope it's supermodel.

1420
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:21,609
Mario 64 is an exfoliating foot peel mask.

1421
01:53:21,609 --> 01:53:23,210
What's with you guys and like the feet?

1422
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:25,449
There's like three feet gifts here.

1423
01:53:26,170 --> 01:53:28,899
I'm gonna give these to Kim.

1424
01:53:28,899 --> 01:53:30,420
Don't tell her because like this,

1425
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:31,300
I'm gonna give this to her.

1426
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:35,460
For soft, healthy feet, natural ingredients

1427
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:36,739
and botanical extracts.

1428
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,470
Get this off.

1429
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:43,029
Seriously, I'm getting uncomfortable with that on.

1430
01:53:44,949 --> 01:53:47,029
But here's the, this is like a funny joke

1431
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:47,750
to like some of you guys,

1432
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:49,750
but Kim isn't gonna go nuts for this shit.

1433
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:52,390
She is gonna be so happy that I have these.

1434
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,789
Oh, that's great.

1435
01:53:56,789 --> 01:53:57,289
Hey.

1436
01:53:57,909 --> 01:53:58,550
Oh, Kim.

1437
01:53:59,829 --> 01:54:03,500
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1438
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,300
I got you a gift.

1439
01:54:06,859 --> 01:54:07,359
Hey.

1440
01:54:09,859 --> 01:54:10,659
What's in this one?

1441
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,140
This one makes noise.

1442
01:54:25,159 --> 01:54:26,199
Bean Boozled.

1443
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,600
Naughty or Nice Jelly Beans.

1444
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:32,310
No, I don't want to do a thing where like,

1445
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:33,510
oh, he's a YouTuber.

1446
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,949
He's gonna eat the fucking jelly beans

1447
01:54:34,949 --> 01:54:37,029
and they puke because it tastes like earwax.

1448
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:42,680
Fine, I'll eat one.

1449
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:43,880
These are gross jelly beans.

1450
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,079
You spin a wheel and oh,

1451
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:46,359
what kind of gross jelly beans

1452
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:47,239
are you gonna eat tonight?

1453
01:54:47,239 --> 01:54:48,119
Fucking dude.

1454
01:54:49,079 --> 01:54:52,949
I'm just gonna pick one.

1455
01:54:53,989 --> 01:54:54,390
This one.

1456
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:55,350
I don't even know what it is.

1457
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,390
This is just kind of yellow.

1458
01:55:00,779 --> 01:55:02,739
Nope, I'm not gonna eat that.

1459
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:04,340
Not gonna happen.

1460
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,220
That tasted like somebody peed in my mouth.

1461
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:08,739
So I'm not gonna eat it.

1462
01:55:08,739 --> 01:55:09,539
I'm gonna put it right here.

1463
01:55:10,579 --> 01:55:12,020
Hey, thanks for the funny thing.

1464
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:12,579
What's this one?

1465
01:55:12,579 --> 01:55:13,859
This one's a little white with some yellow.

1466
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:19,539
I think it's spoiled milk.

1467
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:21,460
It sure does taste like it.

1468
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:25,100
Or it might be rotten egg.

1469
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,539
Whoa, what's this one?

1470
01:55:29,539 --> 01:55:30,420
This is dead fish.

1471
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:32,180
If this is dead fish, I'll throw up ice cream.

1472
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:32,739
You're gonna have to cut.

1473
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,180
I know you're busy doing something,

1474
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,699
but if this is rotten fish,

1475
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:42,659
go to the last funny clips thing from last year.

1476
01:55:49,819 --> 01:55:50,779
Not that one either.

1477
01:55:50,779 --> 01:55:51,739
No, thanks for the gift.

1478
01:55:52,539 --> 01:55:54,520
Thank you for that.

1479
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,640
Thanks for suggesting that I get that.

1480
01:55:59,939 --> 01:56:00,579
That was just like,

1481
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:02,100
I just smelt sardines in my nose

1482
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,140
and I couldn't fucking handle it.

1483
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,539
No, that's it.

1484
01:56:05,539 --> 01:56:10,359
My, that's it.

1485
01:56:10,359 --> 01:56:14,500
Who would make money with this gift?

1486
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:18,779
I put it on a stand.

1487
01:56:18,779 --> 01:56:20,060
Can you imagine selling a product?

1488
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:28,069
I mean, I get it, right?

1489
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:31,510
It's supposed to be fucking disgusting,

1490
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:35,109
but why would you ever say,

1491
01:56:35,109 --> 01:56:36,470
oh, hey, yeah.

1492
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:37,989
Just buy these dead fish

1493
01:56:37,989 --> 01:56:40,149
and battery acid jelly beans.

1494
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:41,109
They're fucking delicious.

1495
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:41,670
It's so funny.

1496
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,350
You prank your friends, okay?

1497
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:45,750
My friends don't think it's funny.

1498
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,470
That's not funny.

1499
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:49,430
It's just, it's just gross.

1500
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:50,390
Oh, I'll spin the wheel.

1501
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:51,109
Fine. One more time.

1502
01:56:52,069 --> 01:56:52,710
Everyone's probably like,

1503
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,550
spin the wheel, you fucking wanker.

1504
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,590
And I'm just like, fucking mate,

1505
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,710
just chill out, mate.

1506
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:57,699
You know what I mean?

1507
01:57:01,529 --> 01:57:02,250
There's a wheel.

1508
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,210
Dare to compare.

1509
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:04,010
All right, let's spin it.

1510
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:05,210
I don't know if you can even see that,

1511
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:10,010
but this has landed on,

1512
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:13,979
I already ate that one.

1513
01:57:13,979 --> 01:57:15,100
I'm not eating dead fish again.

1514
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,180
Juicy pear or booger.

1515
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:23,579
So this is supposed to be a booger.

1516
01:57:23,579 --> 01:57:24,939
Oh, I get it.

1517
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,100
So each one of these could be

1518
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:29,180
either a juicy pear or booger.

1519
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,140
Let's see if this is booger.

1520
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:36,630
I mean, pears kind of taste like boogers, so.

1521
01:57:39,779 --> 01:57:40,979
I eat boogers all the time.

1522
01:57:40,979 --> 01:57:41,779
So I know what it tastes like.

1523
01:57:41,779 --> 01:57:42,579
It tastes like kind of like,

1524
01:57:42,579 --> 01:57:43,859
sour and rotten pear.

1525
01:57:44,899 --> 01:57:45,619
Hey, thanks a lot.

1526
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:46,420
Thanks for the suggestion.

1527
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:48,020
Oh, no.

1528
01:57:48,659 --> 01:57:49,159
Okay.

1529
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:53,380
What is going to do with that?

1530
01:57:53,939 --> 01:57:55,380
I'm like, fucking prank my friends.

1531
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:57,300
Hey, Jay Talens.

1532
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,340
Just in case you're wondering,

1533
01:57:58,819 --> 01:58:00,819
I'm going to give you a jelly bean for Christmas.

1534
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:04,340
You're the only person in Las Vegas, by the way.

1535
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:07,460
So it's all my fucking fault then.

1536
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:08,260
You fucking.

1537
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:10,260
Oh, you fuck it.

1538
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:11,220
You're going to throw me to the fucking water.

1539
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,579
You're going to fuck it, throw me to fuck it.

1540
01:58:12,579 --> 01:58:14,260
You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.

1541
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,220
You know I fucking.

1542
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:15,779
Fuck.

1543
01:58:15,779 --> 01:58:16,260
Fuck you.

1544
01:58:17,369 --> 01:58:18,090
I did what I had to.

1545
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:18,810
I fucking.

1546
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,060
You can't fuck.

1547
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,420
We got another present here.

1548
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:27,159
Ultimate Clay Sand.

1549
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,130
All right, this is cool.

1550
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:33,590
I'm definitely.

1551
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:34,789
I'm going to donate this one for sure,

1552
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:35,829
because this is fucking cool.

1553
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:37,670
You ever play with sand before?

1554
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:48,699
I've never made that noise in my life.

1555
01:58:48,699 --> 01:58:51,260
I just like decided I was going to make the noise.

1556
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,300
Because like, it's funny.

1557
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:53,340
And like I see my friend.

1558
01:58:54,779 --> 01:58:55,720
Don't trim.

1559
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,520
Whatever.

1560
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:00,199
He's like a friend and it's funny.

1561
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,279
I don't make noises like that.

1562
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,020
I'm not even loud either.

1563
01:59:06,939 --> 01:59:08,300
Yeah, this is fucking brilliant.

1564
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:08,859
Really cool.

1565
01:59:10,279 --> 01:59:11,960
This is you pour this out.

1566
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,159
You can mold it and play with it.

1567
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,520
Now, this is a really, really awesome thing.

1568
01:59:17,239 --> 01:59:19,159
Definitely going to be donated for sure.

1569
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:20,119
Because this is fucking cool.

1570
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:22,600
All right.

1571
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,720
Yeah, Clay Sand.

1572
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,600
Never dries out.

1573
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:25,159
Feels great.

1574
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:28,039
You can make like sand castles.

1575
01:59:28,039 --> 01:59:30,600
And I'm doing that here because we're in studio.

1576
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,119
And I ain't fucking up the studio.

1577
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,359
So this is awesome.

1578
01:59:34,359 --> 01:59:34,920
Cool shit.

1579
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:36,920
I was going to have a lot of fun with this.

1580
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:38,359
Thanks for the suggestion.

1581
01:59:40,199 --> 01:59:41,399
Get in there.

1582
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,409
Get in there.

1583
01:59:44,409 --> 01:59:46,810
All right.

1584
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,130
Yeah.

1585
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:54,100
I forgot I had this on.

1586
01:59:54,899 --> 01:59:57,399
I forgot I had like dad dick on.

1587
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,039
Why don't we go back here?

1588
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:01,239
Let's go to like one of these.

1589
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:04,180
One of the table gifts.

1590
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:04,579
What do you say?

1591
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:20,069
Just use some magical powers.

1592
02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:27,670
My name is Steven.

1593
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:29,510
Steven Frog.

1594
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:35,060
What the fuck?

1595
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:35,699
Is it real?

1596
02:00:35,699 --> 02:00:37,220
No, it's a soap.

1597
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:38,579
Summer.

1598
02:00:39,539 --> 02:00:41,939
This is smelling up the whole fucking room.

1599
02:00:44,979 --> 02:00:45,859
Body butter.

1600
02:00:45,859 --> 02:00:47,220
This like stinks.

1601
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:52,760
Oh, we've got some fucking magical Christmas fax machines.

1602
02:00:55,819 --> 02:00:57,020
Hey, look at that.

1603
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,340
Can you smell this from here?

1604
02:01:00,859 --> 02:01:01,979
It's a frog soap.

1605
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:02,619
Here, I'll show you.

1606
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:09,399
That's pretty awesome.

1607
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:10,520
I'm going to use it.

1608
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:11,640
You say what the fuck?

1609
02:01:13,159 --> 02:01:14,119
What the fuck?

1610
02:01:14,119 --> 02:01:15,880
No, it's WFC.

1611
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:16,760
Who would have carved that?

1612
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:18,600
That's pretty fucking cool.

1613
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:20,600
Brown speckled frog.

1614
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:24,699
I'll be rubbing this frog all over my body.

1615
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,420
He smells like Ferti Pebbles.

1616
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:29,020
Oh, that's good.

1617
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:29,979
That's pretty good.

1618
02:01:29,979 --> 02:01:37,189
Oh, that's kind of good, right?

1619
02:01:38,069 --> 02:01:39,189
That's great.

1620
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:40,149
You don't like it?

1621
02:01:40,149 --> 02:01:40,630
It's fun.

1622
02:01:41,829 --> 02:01:42,789
Why do you not like it?

1623
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:44,170
Sorry.

1624
02:01:45,909 --> 02:01:46,630
This thing's normal.

1625
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:48,310
Back to your corner.

1626
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:49,510
Is it not normal?

1627
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:51,189
Is this thing made with something fucking weird?

1628
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:56,550
What is this made with?

1629
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:57,670
Is it made with something weird?

1630
02:01:57,670 --> 02:01:59,029
Is this a joke gift?

1631
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:04,710
Thank you, Salad Gravy for the $15 hashtag charity.

1632
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:05,210
Thank you.

1633
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:08,229
Thank you, Ranglets for the $10.

1634
02:02:08,229 --> 02:02:10,229
I'm kind of drunk at this Christmas party

1635
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:12,550
and I've never said bits before, so sorry in advance.

1636
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,989
Anyway, I want to say you're like the funniest,

1637
02:02:13,989 --> 02:02:15,510
most genuine streamer ever.

1638
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:16,390
Thank you for all you do.

1639
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:16,949
Merry Christmas.

1640
02:02:16,949 --> 02:02:17,909
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1641
02:02:18,869 --> 02:02:19,430
Skip one.

1642
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:21,430
I skipped one.

1643
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:23,829
Oh, the great Canadian fuck club.

1644
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:26,949
Thanks for $50.

1645
02:02:28,789 --> 02:02:29,829
No one's in here.

1646
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:31,029
In where?

1647
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:34,229
Did you see the train that I built earlier?

1648
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:35,189
That was fucking cool.

1649
02:02:35,989 --> 02:02:37,510
Cut to the fucking, cut to the train.

1650
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:40,710
Cut to the goddamn train.

1651
02:03:25,399 --> 02:03:25,960
Fucking cool.

1652
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,140
Look at this.

1653
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:40,329
Were you here for this shit?

1654
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:41,369
Were you here for this?

1655
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:43,109
I don't think you were here.

1656
02:03:43,909 --> 02:03:48,760
I'm gonna have to hit me in the fucking mouth.

1657
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:51,960
No.

1658
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:53,300
No, no, no.

1659
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:53,800
No, no.

1660
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:54,760
Oh.

1661
02:04:05,369 --> 02:04:06,329
Actually, did it get me like...

1662
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:31,380
No one's gonna book it.

1663
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:31,880
Whatever.

1664
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:35,140
Some library is gonna get that, okay?

1665
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:36,819
Well, a local Las Vegas library.

1666
02:04:36,819 --> 02:04:38,579
I'm gonna donate that to a library.

1667
02:04:38,579 --> 02:04:40,420
And you fucking, they're gonna build that up.

1668
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:42,260
They're gonna put like trees and shit.

1669
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,140
It's gonna be great.

1670
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:43,779
I can't wait.

1671
02:04:43,779 --> 02:04:44,579
It's gonna be awesome.

1672
02:04:48,279 --> 02:04:49,319
Hey, unconquerable.

1673
02:04:49,319 --> 02:04:50,680
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

1674
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,359
It's pronounced un-con-quer-able, you boomer.

1675
02:04:55,479 --> 02:04:57,960
Anyways, Merry Christmas.

1676
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,760
You give me and my friends some of the biggest laughs we've had.

1677
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,000
And I continue to cherish each one of your streams as you do them.

1678
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,159
I can always appreciate the lengths you go to for your fans

1679
02:05:07,159 --> 02:05:08,760
and can say it with confidence.

1680
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:09,880
Did I fucking hurt myself?

1681
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:12,199
Then you, my favorite streamer.

1682
02:05:12,199 --> 02:05:14,600
A big hug to you, Kim Italics.

1683
02:05:15,239 --> 02:05:16,279
And Otto in chat.

1684
02:05:16,279 --> 02:05:17,079
Keep on keeping on.

1685
02:05:17,079 --> 02:05:17,880
Germa Hart, thank you.

1686
02:05:19,239 --> 02:05:21,000
Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the 10 bucks.

1687
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,640
Hey, Germa, I wanted to give some big bits to say thank you.

1688
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,239
I've been having a real bad time at home

1689
02:05:25,239 --> 02:05:27,720
and the first time in my life I wasn't excited for Christmas.

1690
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:29,720
I want to thank you so much for the stream.

1691
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:32,680
It made me excited and happy at Christmas again.

1692
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,199
Thank you so much for making me laugh so much

1693
02:05:34,199 --> 02:05:35,319
that I wake up my mother.

1694
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:37,000
Thanks so much, PSA.

1695
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,560
Hey, Peter.

1696
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,079
There you go.

1697
02:05:39,079 --> 02:05:39,560
Hey, Peter.

1698
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,600
And Genetic, thanks for the 10 bucks.

1699
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,119
Genetic, hey, Germa, I remember watching you back

1700
02:05:44,119 --> 02:05:46,359
when you played TF2 and you have been there

1701
02:05:46,359 --> 02:05:48,039
for me during the darkest times.

1702
02:05:48,039 --> 02:05:50,039
I just want to say thanks to you.

1703
02:05:50,039 --> 02:05:50,760
Have a Merry Christmas.

1704
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,039
Hashtag charity.

1705
02:05:52,039 --> 02:05:52,920
Thank you.

1706
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,960
Merry Christmas to you too.

1707
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:54,680
Happy holidays.

1708
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:59,340
I got that from Bugle Mary.

1709
02:05:59,979 --> 02:06:00,859
Do I have any more presents?

1710
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:03,819
Hey, you want to eat a booger jolly bean?

1711
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:07,859
You want to eat a booger jolly bean?

1712
02:06:08,739 --> 02:06:10,520
You want to puke on stream?

1713
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:11,319
What do you think?

1714
02:06:11,319 --> 02:06:12,600
Why don't we both eat one?

1715
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,100
Okay.

1716
02:06:13,479 --> 02:06:21,689
Come on, get over here, son.

1717
02:06:22,489 --> 02:06:27,420
All right, if you puke, your channel has to get banned

1718
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:29,739
if Twitch staff is here.

1719
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:32,460
That's twitch.tv slash Alex.

1720
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,060
Ban him if he throws up on my stream.

1721
02:06:34,859 --> 02:06:37,579
All right, so this is birthday cake or dirty dishwasher.

1722
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:41,100
Okay, come sit down, have a seat on the couch.

1723
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:45,670
So that's birthday cake or a dirty dishwasher.

1724
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:46,229
Are you ready?

1725
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:47,430
I don't get that away from me.

1726
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:49,079
All right, are you ready?

1727
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:52,020
Are we cheersing this?

1728
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:52,579
Yeah, cheers.

1729
02:06:58,619 --> 02:06:59,899
Mine's awful.

1730
02:06:59,899 --> 02:07:00,840
Yeah, that was gross.

1731
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:01,880
I'm out of here.

1732
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:03,159
They're both dirty dishwasher.

1733
02:07:03,159 --> 02:07:03,659
Are they?

1734
02:07:04,699 --> 02:07:07,579
This is bad.

1735
02:07:07,579 --> 02:07:08,060
Is this okay?

1736
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:09,260
It's like illegal to eat this.

1737
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,720
Is it illegal to eat these?

1738
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,359
No, I had some good ones.

1739
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:33,579
Easy joke.

1740
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:38,920
But seriously, but like really though,

1741
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:41,079
thanks to italics for being like tech director.

1742
02:07:41,079 --> 02:07:42,520
He's been the one that's switching the scenes

1743
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,880
and like taking care of things.

1744
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,760
What am I going to do with that?

1745
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:48,279
What do you possibly put, where do you put that?

1746
02:07:48,279 --> 02:07:48,779
Sub sound.

1747
02:07:49,479 --> 02:07:50,979
That's not going to be, no,

1748
02:07:50,979 --> 02:07:52,500
I'm turning off sub sounds forever.

1749
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:55,289
Is it like a funny joke version?

1750
02:07:55,289 --> 02:07:56,170
No, it's just nut.

1751
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,420
Some things are worth a nut.

1752
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:03,260
Here, you like these, have some.

1753
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,140
You like these?

1754
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:08,039
Hey, we gotta talk about presents to unwrap.

1755
02:08:10,039 --> 02:08:13,720
I can't wait to like drink coffee.

1756
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:16,569
This one first.

1757
02:08:16,569 --> 02:08:17,289
That one first.

1758
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:17,789
Pacing.

1759
02:08:18,329 --> 02:08:18,810
Pacing?

1760
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:20,090
We have to pace this production.

1761
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:21,850
Why?

1762
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,529
Because it's time for a little change.

1763
02:08:25,689 --> 02:08:38,819
Oh, it's the Lord of the Rings.

1764
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,180
It's a Gandalf costume.

1765
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:48,920
Hey, look at me.

1766
02:08:50,279 --> 02:08:55,819
All right, so thank you by the way.

1767
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:03,859
Get this fucking Garfield thing off.

1768
02:09:04,979 --> 02:09:06,500
Do I have to wear the whole costume?

1769
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,720
I have to put the entire Garfield costume on.

1770
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:13,850
I mean, you know what?

1771
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:15,850
This is actually, for all the shit I talked,

1772
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:16,729
this is pretty comfortable.

1773
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:19,850
I could see no one wearing this

1774
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:21,770
and Jim Davis having a terrible creation

1775
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:23,289
and the thing's not even funny.

1776
02:09:23,289 --> 02:09:25,210
And like after 1996,

1777
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:26,810
they should have canceled the entire series

1778
02:09:27,449 --> 02:09:30,409
and there should never have been another book ever made.

1779
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:32,170
And I don't know why it's an American icon.

1780
02:09:32,489 --> 02:09:35,529
But it's comfortable outerwear, I think.

1781
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:39,289
All right, here's the frog soap.

1782
02:09:39,289 --> 02:09:41,289
Can't wait to fucking on that.

1783
02:09:41,289 --> 02:09:41,789
No.

1784
02:09:43,689 --> 02:09:49,260
Hey, Gandalf.

1785
02:09:57,319 --> 02:09:58,439
Define this one.

1786
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:04,119
All right, do I have to put the whole thing on?

1787
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:06,100
I shouldn't have to, right?

1788
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,430
It's probably one piece.

1789
02:10:10,229 --> 02:10:12,229
Is it one gigantic piece?

1790
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:14,630
How complicated do you think Gandalf's costume is?

1791
02:10:15,029 --> 02:10:19,189
I mean, it really is just like a big gray tablecloth.

1792
02:10:19,989 --> 02:10:21,029
Is this the beard?

1793
02:10:21,029 --> 02:10:21,989
Holy fuck.

1794
02:10:21,989 --> 02:10:23,350
Look at this terrible hat.

1795
02:10:25,029 --> 02:10:25,529
Wow.

1796
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:29,750
Holy shit.

1797
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:30,789
Is it inside out?

1798
02:10:30,789 --> 02:10:31,670
I feel like it is.

1799
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,699
Did it come with a beard?

1800
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:39,739
How am I supposed to put this on?

1801
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:45,560
I'm like stepping in it.

1802
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:47,000
I guess I'm gonna put it on like this.

1803
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:51,829
Why Gandalf?

1804
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:55,189
How many times have I ever talked about Gandalf on the stream?

1805
02:10:55,909 --> 02:10:57,750
Like maybe three times ever?

1806
02:10:59,909 --> 02:11:01,750
I'm surprised there's no hobbit costume.

1807
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:04,149
Because like, oh LOL, he's got like his fucking feet.

1808
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:05,109
He's got his small.

1809
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:06,229
He's like five seven.

1810
02:11:06,789 --> 02:11:08,390
But you give me the Gandalf costume?

1811
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:09,670
All right, that's fine.

1812
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:12,069
That's the Gandalf costume from the hobbit.

1813
02:11:13,109 --> 02:11:17,180
Well, here's like the weird cigar that is his beard.

1814
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:30,460
This is the beard.

1815
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:33,109
It's like a fucking what?

1816
02:11:33,109 --> 02:11:34,869
It's like a lunch lady hair in it.

1817
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:35,909
It's like a snake.

1818
02:11:35,909 --> 02:11:37,109
How is this a beard?

1819
02:11:37,829 --> 02:11:38,630
This is a beard.

1820
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:40,069
This is the beard?

1821
02:11:41,779 --> 02:11:42,100
What?

1822
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:48,250
Oh, it's a beard.

1823
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:49,449
Where's the beard?

1824
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:51,529
I don't understand where the beard is.

1825
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:59,819
All right, when I say this, you gotta put on like a cool voice.

1826
02:12:00,619 --> 02:12:01,979
But wait till I get the whole thing on.

1827
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:06,340
Okay, so where's the beard?

1828
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:10,729
This costume didn't come with a beard.

1829
02:12:11,369 --> 02:12:13,000
Seriously.

1830
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:14,520
Where's the fucking beard?

1831
02:12:17,439 --> 02:12:21,199
There's clearly a beard on that thumbnail thing.

1832
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,279
Where's the beard?

1833
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:30,970
Where's the fucking beard?

1834
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:32,489
There's no beard.

1835
02:12:33,529 --> 02:12:38,329
What a scam.

1836
02:12:38,329 --> 02:12:38,970
There's no beard.

1837
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:44,970
Was I supposed to buy a beard separately?

1838
02:12:46,329 --> 02:12:50,840
All right, put me on.

1839
02:12:58,619 --> 02:12:59,500
I gotta be honest with you.

1840
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:01,819
You shall not pass, you fucking dingus.

1841
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:05,020
Tell me when you're ready.

1842
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:06,859
So I'm gonna say you.

1843
02:13:06,859 --> 02:13:08,140
You need to point at me when it's ready.

1844
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:12,640
I still taste dishwasher soap.

1845
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,079
Ready?

1846
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:15,359
Okay.

1847
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:20,960
You shall not pass.

1848
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:32,909
Okay, there's no beard.

1849
02:13:32,909 --> 02:13:34,109
What a shitty costume.

1850
02:13:35,449 --> 02:13:37,449
That's the worst fucking costume I've ever seen.

1851
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:39,850
Fuck that company.

1852
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:41,050
Fuck the company that made this.

1853
02:13:41,050 --> 02:13:41,930
Fuck that whole company.

1854
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:43,930
There's no beard.

1855
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:47,050
Okay, this is just like dirty guy with a funny hat on.

1856
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:48,569
There's no beard.

1857
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:53,869
What's in here?

1858
02:13:53,869 --> 02:14:01,420
A piece of timer.

1859
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:10,640
This is not a gift.

1860
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:23,279
This is, this was supposed to be LED candles.

1861
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:30,239
For when Bugleberry did his little thing.

1862
02:14:31,449 --> 02:14:32,329
It's a prop.

1863
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:35,529
It's a prop that was supposed to,

1864
02:14:35,529 --> 02:14:39,050
and I was wondering where these were.

1865
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:40,489
Remember I asked you specifically,

1866
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:43,130
I was like, I think I'm missing a fucking package.

1867
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:45,050
So was your two presents.

1868
02:14:46,810 --> 02:14:47,689
That's one.

1869
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:49,770
These were supposed to be scattered around

1870
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:51,289
and I didn't know where they were

1871
02:14:51,289 --> 02:14:53,130
and I think Kim accidentally may have

1872
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:54,729
packaged them up.

1873
02:14:57,689 --> 02:14:59,369
And there's like somebody's card in here.

1874
02:15:00,890 --> 02:15:03,449
Okay, because I was wondering where the fuck these went.

1875
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:04,810
All right, well, that's great.

1876
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:08,010
Thank you, me, for buying a prop that never got used

1877
02:15:08,649 --> 02:15:10,649
and was accidentally wrapped up, apparently.

1878
02:15:12,329 --> 02:15:18,270
Hey, there's another one.

1879
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:19,710
Who is this from?

1880
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:20,270
The Mods?

1881
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:22,050
Chat?

1882
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:28,939
Are we sure there's another beard lying around here somewhere?

1883
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:31,310
Give me yours.

1884
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:32,270
Just like cut yours off.

1885
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:35,449
All right, what's in this one?

1886
02:15:35,449 --> 02:15:36,010
Let's see.

1887
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:47,180
It's more, it's more bananas.

1888
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:48,619
It's more you're the top banana.

1889
02:15:50,109 --> 02:15:51,069
How did this get through?

1890
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:52,829
A second gift.

1891
02:15:52,829 --> 02:15:56,029
A second you're the top banana.

1892
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:01,369
That's not even funny.

1893
02:16:01,369 --> 02:16:03,609
I think he went two boxes

1894
02:16:03,609 --> 02:16:05,529
and she just wrapped them separately.

1895
02:16:06,329 --> 02:16:08,010
It's the same gift.

1896
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:10,090
So we're missing three gifts.

1897
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:11,930
Where did they go?

1898
02:16:12,649 --> 02:16:13,210
I don't know.

1899
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:18,649
So these are supposed to be in one, in one package.

1900
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:22,569
And she wrapped them in, okay.

1901
02:16:24,569 --> 02:16:25,770
It was the same order.

1902
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:26,729
It's the same order.

1903
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:29,369
Well, there's like 50.

1904
02:16:29,369 --> 02:16:32,090
They sell them in multiple boxes.

1905
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:32,569
Let me, let me, oh.

1906
02:16:33,770 --> 02:16:38,799
Did they do anything?

1907
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:39,840
Did these do anything?

1908
02:16:40,399 --> 02:16:41,280
Did they do anything?

1909
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,120
They're just plastic bananas.

1910
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,319
What a waste of time.

1911
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:45,440
The smiley face.

1912
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:47,440
Look at that face.

1913
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:48,079
You could, okay.

1914
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:50,399
You could seriously like give these to people on the street

1915
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:51,600
and be like, hey, let me tell you something.

1916
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:53,520
You're the top banana.

1917
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,559
I got so many of these.

1918
02:16:55,520 --> 02:17:00,200
What am I going to do with this shit?

1919
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:00,840
What a joke.

1920
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:03,639
All right, well more top bananas.

1921
02:17:03,639 --> 02:17:05,559
I'm not sure how that happened.

1922
02:17:05,559 --> 02:17:13,659
I thought I had the dad dick on still.

1923
02:17:14,299 --> 02:17:15,340
What's this even for?

1924
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:15,840
I thought.

1925
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:29,930
Got it.

1926
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:37,950
Oh, this is a magic science for wizards only.

1927
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:39,549
I think I fit that category now.

1928
02:17:39,549 --> 02:17:41,790
Magic science for wizards only.

1929
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:44,829
Nice.

1930
02:17:44,829 --> 02:17:45,329
Okay.

1931
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:48,510
Cast color changing spells.

1932
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,879
Is it, can I, can I try one?

1933
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:56,239
Is it elaborate?

1934
02:17:56,239 --> 02:17:57,840
If it's elaborate, I'm going to donate it.

1935
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:01,579
It goes into donation if it's like elaborate and fun.

1936
02:18:03,129 --> 02:18:06,809
If it's a Gandalf costume with no beard, it stays on my body.

1937
02:18:07,850 --> 02:18:14,680
That looks pretty fucking elaborate.

1938
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:17,159
Have fun with that.

1939
02:18:17,959 --> 02:18:18,459
Son.

1940
02:18:19,799 --> 02:18:20,299
Okay.

1941
02:18:21,159 --> 02:18:22,200
Magic science.

1942
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:27,819
It's like sorbitol and food coloring.

1943
02:18:34,889 --> 02:18:35,530
What's that for?

1944
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:38,250
I'm not sure.

1945
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:40,010
That's it.

1946
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:40,569
This is cool.

1947
02:18:40,569 --> 02:18:41,610

1948
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:46,700
Have fun with that.

1949
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,659
Somebody's going to get that.

1950
02:18:47,659 --> 02:18:49,180
They're going to have a fucking blast.

1951
02:18:49,739 --> 02:18:50,459
They're going to make like.

1952
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:55,420
I just kind of spit on it though.

1953
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:56,139
Like I'm sorry.

1954
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:58,139
And I fucking packaged it wrong.

1955
02:18:58,139 --> 02:18:58,700
I'll fix it.

1956
02:18:58,700 --> 02:18:59,200
Don't worry.

1957
02:18:59,979 --> 02:19:03,899
I can't use that right now because I'll be in big fucking trouble.

1958
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:08,379
Thank you for the magic science kit to make potions and brain fluids.

1959
02:19:10,350 --> 02:19:11,149
Sounds fucking cool.

1960
02:19:12,989 --> 02:19:13,870
Just put these around.

1961
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:14,270
Why not?

1962
02:19:14,909 --> 02:19:17,149
I was actually fucking looking for these too.

1963
02:19:17,149 --> 02:19:18,110
Like that's so stupid.

1964
02:19:19,309 --> 02:19:19,629
All right.

1965
02:19:19,629 --> 02:19:21,309
We got like seven or eight more.

1966
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:39,280
One size fits most of those battery operated fan inflates costume.

1967
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:42,329
This is an inflatable costume.

1968
02:19:45,930 --> 02:19:47,690
It's an inflatable frog.

1969
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,489
All right.

1970
02:19:48,489 --> 02:19:50,569
Hey Gandalf go fuck yourself.

1971
02:19:50,569 --> 02:19:52,250
Your last three movies weren't even good.

1972
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:56,719
They were good.

1973
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,159
Did you like the Hobbit?

1974
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:03,360
I mean the Hobbit was all right but like it wasn't as good as

1975
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,680
Gandalf which is the number two one.

1976
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:10,829
All right.

1977
02:20:10,829 --> 02:20:13,069
Let's put on the frog inflatable and then you have to.

1978
02:20:13,069 --> 02:20:14,110
I'm going to body slam me.

1979
02:20:17,069 --> 02:20:19,079
You have to fight me in the frog costume.

1980
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,799
I'm going to one punch man you.

1981

2003
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:23,319
How am I supposed to get inside of this like a zipper?

2004
02:21:30,010 --> 02:21:30,329

So it's all my fucking fault then.

2013
02:22:14,479 --> 02:24:17,180
I feel like they're over here.

2014
02:24:25,659 --> 02:24:27,100
Where did I put the batteries?

2015
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:35,770
Where are the batteries?

2016
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:43,389
I brought so many batteries and they're gone forever.

2017
02:24:43,389 --> 02:24:45,629

What are you playing right now?

2034
02:27:06,479 --> 02:27:08,079
Where the fuck are those batteries?

2035
02:27:08,719 --> 02:27:10,879

02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:22,159
I fucking.

2046
02:27:23,549 --> 02:27:25,389
You can't fucking blame me for that.

2047
02:27:25,389 --> 02:27:26,350
Fucking bullshit.

2048
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:26,909
Tell it again.

2049
02:27:26,909 --> 02:27:27,549
Tell it again.

2050
02:27:27,549 --> 02:27:27,790
Tell it.

2051
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:28,110
Listen.

2052
02:27:28,110 --> 02:27:29,870
I've told the story like four times.

2053
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:33,469
Just please let me be the example for this okay?

2054
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:36,909
Stay the fuck away from yard tools.

2055
02:27:36,909 --> 02:27:38,190
Don't touch anything dangerous.

2056
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:39,389
Don't like rake your leaves.

2057
02:27:39,389 --> 02:27:40,270
You're gonna like.

2058
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:43,709
And then all of a sudden you got $1400 worth of dentistry work.

2059
02:27:43,709 --> 02:27:44,670
Actually can't beat him.

2060
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:47,389
He swings way too weirdly.

2061
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:51,549
And I can't even get the correct controls right.

2062
02:27:51,549 --> 02:27:52,750
Shouldn't do r2 twice.

2063
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:54,110
Don't even think about it.

2064
02:27:55,229 --> 02:27:56,030
All right.

2065
02:27:56,030 --> 02:27:56,829
No no no no no.

2066
02:27:57,709 --> 02:27:58,030
Come on.

2067
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:00,409
No no no back up.

2068
02:28:00,969 --> 02:28:02,440
No.

2069
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:03,399
Oh.

2070
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:06,700
Rock.

2071
02:28:07,739 --> 02:28:16,239
Got it.

2072
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:19,049
I got it.

2073
02:28:19,049 --> 02:28:19,370
I got it.

2074
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:19,530
I got it.

2075
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:19,850
I got it.

2076
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:20,010
I got it.

2077
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:21,229
I got it.

2078
02:28:21,229 --> 02:28:24,010
I just had to get these open.

2079
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:24,729
The this open.

2080
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:28,879
Where's the pepe the fucking inflatable frog.

2081
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:31,549
They're double a never mind.

2082
02:28:31,549 --> 02:28:32,590
It's fucking what a waste of time.

2083
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:33,149
He's a double.

2084
02:28:33,149 --> 02:28:34,270
Triple a and I need double a.

2085
02:28:36,299 --> 02:28:37,739
Bring like a whole box of that.

2086
02:28:37,739 --> 02:28:39,340
I brought a box of them.

2087
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,100
And I don't know what the fuck they are.

2088
02:28:44,299 --> 02:28:45,500
What is it here?

2089
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:47,360
It's a triple a.

2090
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:48,879
It's a nothing.

2091
02:28:48,879 --> 02:28:49,840
Where are the batteries?

2092
02:28:52,250 --> 02:28:53,129
They're in this bag.

2093
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:14,090
Oh god.

2094
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:30,250
Are they over here?

2095
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:32,510
What's over here?

2096
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:35,850
Oh for the love of god.

2097
02:29:37,209 --> 02:29:37,530
Fuck.

2098
02:29:42,409 --> 02:29:44,090
Where are these batteries?

2099
02:29:44,809 --> 02:29:46,170
I'm going to lose my mind.

2100
02:29:54,879 --> 02:29:55,120
Shit.

2101
02:29:59,129 --> 02:30:00,569
They're in a ziplock bag.

2102
02:30:01,930 --> 02:30:09,049
Does anybody see these fucking things?

2103
02:30:12,139 --> 02:30:12,940
God damn it.

2104
02:30:13,739 --> 02:30:16,750
Like there's so much shit over here.

2105
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:35,600
If I don't know where they are.

2106
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:36,399
They're gone.

2107
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:37,680
They're just apparently they're gone.

2108
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:49,840
All right I'll put I'll put it on later.

2109
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:50,719
I'll try to find it later.

2110
02:30:50,719 --> 02:30:51,360
Next present.

2111
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:53,040
Thank you for the next gift by the way.

2112
02:30:54,409 --> 02:31:03,879
Thank you for uh this is this giant home.

2113
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:11,420
An Ottoman alone.

2114
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:14,459
What on earth?

2115
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:17,149
I mean this is cool but

2116
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:24,319
I've actually seen videos of this thing I think.

2117
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:31,790
This is actually really fucking awesome.

2118
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:32,750
All right hold on.

2119
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:50,959
Where is in that one?

2120
02:31:50,959 --> 02:32:04,840
I don't see anything.

2121
02:32:05,959 --> 02:32:07,159
Next to your left leg.

2122
02:32:10,090 --> 02:32:11,209
I see a spider.

2123
02:32:11,209 --> 02:32:14,600
Your left thigh.

2124
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:16,360
I need to open this with a screwdriver.

2125
02:32:20,299 --> 02:32:21,899
Fucking screwdriver man.

2126
02:32:21,899 --> 02:32:27,020
I bought like a pack of triple A's and a pack of double A's for this exact.

2127
02:32:29,399 --> 02:32:30,040
I see three.

2128
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:33,790
Can you find me one double A battery?

2129
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:34,670
Find it for me.

2130
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:35,629
Double or triple?

2131
02:32:35,629 --> 02:32:36,829
Find me a double A battery.

2132
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:41,719
I can't fucking open this thing with this.

2133
02:32:42,989 --> 02:32:44,030
Where the hell am I real?

2134
02:32:44,670 --> 02:33:00,680
Oh damn it.

2135
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:03,559
Screws.

2136
02:33:03,559 --> 02:33:07,049
Why does everyone have to have a bunch of screws?

2137
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:13,479
Fuck.

2138
02:33:13,479 --> 02:33:14,760
I need to turn the lights on.

2139
02:33:14,760 --> 02:34:10,600
You want them on either of them.

2140
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:12,440
Series where I play Minecraft.

2141
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,159
This is going to be a single player let's play.

2142
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:21,399
And when I say let's play I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.

2143
02:34:21,399 --> 02:34:22,600
You're going to see lots of fails.

2144
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:24,600
You're going to see lots of triumphs.

2145
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:25,799
At least I'm hoping.

2146
02:34:25,879 --> 02:34:28,120
So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.

2147
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:29,399
Hot cup of cocoa.

2148
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,479
I got apple cider right here freshly brewed.

2149
02:34:31,479 --> 02:34:33,760
Let me take a sip.

2150
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:35,120
Ah that's good cider.

2151
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:39,229
All right so let's get this started.

2152
02:34:39,229 --> 02:34:40,350
Create new world.

2153
02:34:41,389 --> 02:34:45,739
World name is going to be Germacraft.

2154
02:34:46,379 --> 02:34:47,760
Sounds about right.

2155
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,100
Yeah okay.

2156
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:51,979
Game mode is going to be Survival.

2157
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:53,260
That's the most interesting I think.

2158
02:34:54,139 --> 02:34:55,260
More world options.

2159
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:56,379
Seed for world generator.

2160
02:34:56,379 --> 02:34:57,420
Okay this is important.

2161
02:34:58,059 --> 02:35:01,340
I got to name this something crazy to get cool.

2162
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:07,520
It's not Germacraft unless you have something crazy happen.

2163
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:09,440
So I'm going to go fight this asshole over here.

2164
02:35:10,239 --> 02:35:12,590
Look at this cows too.

2165
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:14,510
Do I have I don't have a sword.

2166
02:35:15,309 --> 02:35:16,590
This is going to be interesting.

2167
02:35:17,879 --> 02:35:19,000
I should have just made one.

2168
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,280
I should have just made a sword.

2169
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,479
What am I doing?

2170
02:35:21,479 --> 02:35:22,840
Why am I doing this?

2171
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:25,479
Why am I going after this guy right now?

2172
02:35:25,479 --> 02:35:26,600
What does the matter with me?

2173
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:29,239
Actually play this game.

2174
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:33,340
I just I'm just using my walls.

2175
02:35:34,299 --> 02:35:36,559
Oh yeah that's fine.

2176
02:35:36,559 --> 02:35:39,280
I'm just going to tear down my own walls to get wood.

2177
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:43,040
That's right.

2178
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,850
Yeah let there be light.

2179
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:49,520
Aim up.

2180
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:53,049
Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't disappear.

2181
02:35:54,090 --> 02:35:56,110
That's what grandpa told me.

2182
02:35:57,549 --> 02:36:00,700
Look at that beautiful moon.

2183
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:01,340
So elegant.

2184
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:05,690
Okay so I got that wood.

2185
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:06,569
Let's do something with it.

2186
02:36:08,329 --> 02:36:11,309
Make it into a bunch of things.

2187
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:14,059
Shift click.

2188
02:36:15,549 --> 02:36:19,549
I promise this is not going to be this much of a mess through the whole series.

2189
02:36:21,549 --> 02:36:24,670
And if it is then whoops.

2190
02:36:33,530 --> 02:36:36,329
Welcome to another episode of JermaCraft.

2191
02:36:37,290 --> 02:36:39,450
And as you can see I'm doing a little bit of renovating.

2192
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:44,000
Doing some renovations on the house if you could tell.

2193
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:46,559
Because this thing is a mess.

2194
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:47,840
Just trying to clean it up a little bit.

2195
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:51,280
And oh my god no this has happened before.

2196
02:36:52,159 --> 02:36:52,719
Don't worry.

2197
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,200
Keep going below with the coal.

2198
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:57,840
Mine is steel.

2199
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,399
Mine is steel.

2200
02:37:02,299 --> 02:37:05,340
We got a man at steel and man at cobblestone.

2201
02:37:07,129 --> 02:37:08,649
Where the hell am I even going?

2202
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:12,010
All right let's go.

2203
02:37:12,010 --> 02:37:15,370
I will find something before this pick breaks.

2204
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,920
Or it was it'll kill me.

2205
02:37:20,250 --> 02:37:33,920
Oh yeah aimlessly digging around.

2206
02:37:34,959 --> 02:37:36,239
Best part about Minecraft.

2207
02:37:38,829 --> 02:37:39,229
Torch.

2208
02:37:45,659 --> 02:37:46,940
Oh we found a little bit of coal.

2209
02:38:16,219 --> 02:38:26,799
Did I get the wrong way?

2210
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:53,229
All right you gotta come zip me.

2211
02:38:53,229 --> 02:39:02,510
You gotta zip me.

2212
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:07,850
Does this go inside?

2213
02:39:08,409 --> 02:39:14,559
All right zip it up.

2214
02:39:14,559 --> 02:39:16,909
Is it doing it?

2215
02:39:16,909 --> 02:39:19,950
It's all the way from the track.

2216
02:39:19,950 --> 02:39:20,670
You gotta start.

2217
02:39:37,239 --> 02:39:37,879
It's caught.

2218
02:39:37,879 --> 02:39:38,680
You have to do it.

2219
02:39:40,430 --> 02:39:40,989
It's caught.

2220
02:39:54,799 --> 02:39:55,920
It is caught.

2221
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:56,479
It's caught.

2222
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:59,159
You got it?

2223
02:39:59,159 --> 02:40:01,709
No the zipper's stuck.

2224
02:40:02,430 --> 02:40:35,799
Okay what's left?

2225
02:40:35,799 --> 02:40:49,469
Oh thanks man.

2226
02:40:50,110 --> 02:40:52,110
Thanks for the iPhone charger.

2227
02:40:52,829 --> 02:40:53,309
Sick.

2228
02:40:53,950 --> 02:41:04,940
I thought this was a friend.

2229
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:05,819
Oh no.

2230
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:11,979
I can't see in this fucking mask.

2231
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:14,299
You don't even have to head off.

2232
02:41:15,659 --> 02:41:21,280
This is very disorienting.

2233
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:21,920
What?

2234
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:23,040
What are you gonna have?

2235
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:23,440
Hold on.

2236
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:25,360
I'm gonna have to pull against your neck.

2237
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:26,000
All right do it.

2238
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,379
Eat your own hand up.

2239
02:41:32,379 --> 02:41:33,340
I don't want these.

2240
02:41:34,139 --> 02:41:35,100
Don't drop them.

2241
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:36,299
Pull that thing over your head.

2242
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:37,500
It's in the back.

2243
02:41:38,059 --> 02:41:38,780
All the way at the back.

2244
02:41:41,549 --> 02:41:41,870
What?

2245
02:41:41,870 --> 02:41:42,750
No no no.

2246
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:42,989
Here.

2247
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:45,149
What are you talking about?

2248
02:41:45,149 --> 02:41:45,790
Grab here.

2249
02:41:46,989 --> 02:41:48,909
Right there and pull that thing over your head.

2250
02:41:49,549 --> 02:41:51,600
No no no it doesn't work like that.

2251
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:52,479
It's like a double.

2252
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:55,200
There's like frog eyes up there.

2253
02:41:56,239 --> 02:41:57,920
I can't see anything with this.

2254
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:59,280
This is bouncy balls.

2255
02:41:59,280 --> 02:41:59,920
Uh cool.

2256
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,239
I'm gonna donate these.

2257
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:08,479
I can't fucking believe these all fell out.

2258
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,239
Oh god damn it.

2259
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:21,399
Stilts have screws.

2260
02:42:21,399 --> 02:42:24,409
This is the last part of them.

2261
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:31,200
This is vibrating my ass.

2262
02:42:32,079 --> 02:42:33,979
This is the last one.

2263
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:40,489
Oh and it is the best one by far.

2264
02:42:42,719 --> 02:42:44,079
Absolutely best one by far.

2265
02:42:44,079 --> 02:42:45,360
This is shot water tapping.

2266
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:52,780
This is like the only thing I wanted for Christmas.

2267
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:53,579
Seriously.

2268
02:42:53,579 --> 02:42:55,659
This is the only thing that I wanted.

2269
02:43:00,760 --> 02:43:01,000
What?

2270
02:43:01,879 --> 02:43:11,920
Does that work?

2271
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:14,680
It looks like you've put something up.

2272
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:19,799
This is the this is the best gift to do last year.

2273
02:43:19,799 --> 02:43:22,280
You look like scuffed Yoshi.

2274
02:43:23,719 --> 02:43:24,219
Yoshi!

2275
02:43:25,159 --> 02:43:25,659
Brrring!

2276
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:26,860
Brrring!

2277
02:43:41,239 --> 02:43:45,149
Is that it?

2278
02:43:45,149 --> 02:43:50,479
I can't open this because I don't have the thing.

2279
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:52,319
I don't have the I don't have a screwdriver.

2280
02:43:58,520 --> 02:43:59,079
Is that it?

2281
02:43:59,639 --> 02:44:00,280
Is that right?

2282
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:02,399
Thanks for the tip.

2283
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:14,040
Why would anybody fucking wear this for more than five seconds?

2284
02:44:15,559 --> 02:44:17,479
I I actually can't get out of here.

2285
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:22,729
Listen the stilts have screws, Jack.

2286
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:35,819
Oh how do I turn this fucking thing off?

2287
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:38,700
Uh best gifts of the evening?

2288
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:39,420
I'll tell you.

2289
02:44:40,299 --> 02:44:44,680
