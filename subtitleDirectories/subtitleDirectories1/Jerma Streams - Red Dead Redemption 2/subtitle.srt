1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:15,429
Hey guys, what's up? How are you? We're here, currently, live, technically live.

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,980
I cannot guarantee that we're gonna be live for very long. We've had cocks at the house for the

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:35,560
last like six straight days, and they may have figured out one of the issues. So,

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,429
it's just like the first Red Dead stream, that's right. We'll see how long we can go.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,859
This is going to be one of those mystery boxes that you open. The stream might be two hours.

6
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:54,630
It might be 10 minutes. It might be six hours. I don't know. I can't, it's a mystery.

7
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,429
Just literally RNG the stream. I know it already already got already dead.

8
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:06,519
No, no, we're okay. Are we? No? Hey, I'm here. We just almost dropped though.

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, that's probably gonna happen like every 15 minutes. One minute. Oh, shit.

10
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,959
All right, when I press the button, it's probably, it's probably gonna do that.

11
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:33,189
So, let's ride it out here for as long as we can. I'll do my, do my best to.

12
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh, this is getting ugly. Before he moves back. No, there's no going back.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:05,849
Damn, it was just green for so long too. It was just so solid green and now it just doesn't

14
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,729
want to, just doesn't want to do it. Let's just, what's with the music?

15
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:20,199
You might be hearing the PS4 sound effects. Let's see. It's, it's there.

16
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:29,930
Moved on from Comcast and got worse internet. I have no idea. It's almost like a bad joke

17
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:38,840
at this point because this is a, this is a gigabit line. This is a, this is a thousand

18
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,629
megabits per second down. This is what we get for down. And they're, they just have some major,

19
00:02:46,629 --> 00:03:00,710
major issues that are apparently, take a lot of work to solve. So, this is happening way

20
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:10,120
more frequently than it just was. Nice, already buffering, getting a buffering popup already.

21
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:20,300
Yeah, well, we'll let, let just, just hang out with me for a minute. We'll sit here for a moment

22
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:29,180
because we do get these spots of like a few hours where it's perfectly fine.

23
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,530
I'm getting back in a balloon. I'm going back to Boston. Let's see. What do I take

24
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:44,569
this screen off? What if I did this? Like you can see that, right? Because that's, that's

25
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:51,960
red dead right there. Come on, just like, just like feed me through the line that I need

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:05,139
to be on. So I cannot guarantee the authenticity of this current stream. And I'm, I'm so afraid to

27
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:11,060
press the story button. I'm going to press X and it's going to crash the fucking node.

28
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:25,300
What a social club. I think it's the rock star thing when you get online, right? Press X.

29
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,959
Should I? I'm so scared. I'm so scared that it's not going to work.

30
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:41,589
I should, here goes the node. I'm doing it. I care. I will fight through the frame drops here

31
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,300
because you guys wouldn't even believe this is nothing. We would lose internet for

32
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,959
12 straight hours. It would just be zero. All right. I'm going. I'm here. We go.

33
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:17,740
Wish me luck. Ready? One, two. I did it. Okay. Okay. I'll turn it up a little bit.

34
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:26,360
So this is, so this is red dead redemption two, by the way, if you weren't aware,

35
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,560
it's a new Western game that came out. I mean, is this supposed to be somebody talking here?

36
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,550
Spoilers. Well, what are you doing at a red dead two stream? If you're scared about spoilers.

37
00:05:52,649 --> 00:06:00,500
I lived in Vinnie's dryer for a week. Well, that's not out of the ordinary though.

38
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:16,970
I pay rent and the age of outlaws and gunslingers was at an end. I have to turn this

39
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:34,060
up. There's like a volume control on this dumb thing. There we go. Turn it up. It's

40
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,850
got to do a cowboy accent. I've even the wish had mostly been tamed. That was until they showed

41
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:54,180
up. Bill, Bob, Barry, Borg. A few gangs still remain, but they were being hunted down and

42
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,769
destroyed. I can't read cursive. I got taught cursive. I don't know how to fucking read it.

43
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,100
There we go. That was a cursive. I would have been upset about that.

44
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:29,019
Rockstar games presents red dead two. Why does it look like horror movie text? Here we go.

45
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:35,850
I'm so excited for this. Give me my internet. I deserve it. I deserve an internet.

46
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,930
That's a lot of bird shit. All right, stop. I want to make a joke about a million birds

47
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,430
shitting all over them, but I can't stop it. Don't stop soon. We'll all be dying.

48
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,290
Whether it's May, I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.

49
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:15,060
There, Arthur. Any luck? That's me, right? I found a place where we can get some shelter.

50
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:22,339
Let Davey rest while he, you know, an old man in town.

51
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:37,370
Come on. Come on. Old man in town. 10 FPS with gameplay. You might be referring to

52
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:56,120
my internet. Chapter one. Byron. I don't know what that says. I'm not going to read the

53
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:12,120
subtitles at the bottom. I'm going to try to read it. Flash Schlistro. This game is like

54
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,440
an hour long tutorial. Hey, just long enough to us to make sure the internet will stay on.

55
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:30,039
Hey, welcome to the stream. Oh my God. Ms. Gaskell, get that fire link.

56
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,159
Javadab just gave 250 dollars. Mr. Pearson, see what we've got in terms of food.

57
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,370
Davey's dead. Thank you, Javadab. Nothing more you could have done. What are we going to do?

58
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,250
We need supplies. Well, first of all, you're going to stay here and you were going to get

59
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,809
yourself worn. And I sent John and Mike scouting out ahead. That's welcome. Thank you, man.

60
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,649
Thank you so much. See if we can find one. We can wait for some time to deliver these bits

61
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,409
to you. It's great to see you back in action, especially after you had to once again deal

62
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:11,769
with some internet issues. Still are. Listen. Still are at the moment. Listen to me,

63
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:25,899
all for a moment. Now we've had John a bad couple of days. I loved Davey, Jenny,

64
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:35,659
Sean, Mac, John, barf bag. We don't know. Something like that. But we lost some folks.

65
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:48,149
Now, if I could throw myself in the ground in their stead, I'd do it. Gladly. Quit

66
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:55,480
Comcast. I don't have Comcast. I have a different ISP across the country and it still follows me.

67
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:04,299
Everybody. We're safe now. There ain't nobody following us through a storm like this one.

68
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:09,740
By the time they get here. Well, we're going to be, we're going to be long gone.

69
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,190
We've been through worse than this. John McFar's stun. That was the guy.

70
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,389
Mr. Pierce, Ms. Grimshaw. I need you to turn this place into a camp.

71
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:29,289
We may be here for a few days. Now, all of you, all of you get yourselves warm.

72
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:36,179
Stay strong. It might be the modem router. Oh, no, no, no. Single option is being.

73
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,980
So they both must have headed down the hill.

74
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:55,620
Sure. Hey. Oh, are we like dead dead now? I had time to ask. Oh, boy.

75
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:02,580
What really went down back there on that boat? We missed you. That's what happened. Come on.

76
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,870
Hey, you need horses. Oh, yeah. Hey, Mr. Smith, get yourself indoors.

77
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,429
I know. I can see it over here. Get indoors, son.

78
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,750
All right. I get to play the game though. Need you strong.

79
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:32,470
Okay. It's deep snow. I ain't sure what we're going to find out here, Dutz.

80
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,190
We have to try. Is this game not on PC at all? Is it on PC now?

81
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,669
We'll do our best to stick to the trail. This goddamn weather.

82
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,870
It's been two days or more like this now. Yeah, I didn't think it was.

83
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,340
There's Jabba Dab's two hundred and fifty dollars coming in. Again, thank you so much, man.

84
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,539
I know I'm like trying to bounce and monitor my connection and play a game.

85
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,620
And thank you so fucking much, dude. It's a huge amount of money.

86
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,340
Big delayed money. Yeah, I don't know why that's happening.

87
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,789
I don't know what it is with Rockstar and not putting their flagship video games on PC.

88
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,549
The first Red Dead is not even on. Red Dead Redemption is not on

89
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:34,549
PC at all or some strange reason we need to get those people warm and fed.

90
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,870
At least we don't need to worry about Pinkerton's tailing us in this

91
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:46,870
a couple more days. You need to help me pick the others back up.

92
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,470
Okay. You're the only one I can rely on to stay.

93
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,669
I'm sorry. All I heard was crouch in the corner and throw rocks at people.

94
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,429
Is that what you wanted me to do with my Dalmatian horse?

95
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:07,269
Oh, that's snow, right? I thought it was like a giant Dalmatian.

96
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:18,379
Is that someone coming towards us? Someone coming towards us. Are they friendly?

97
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,639
Oh, cutscene. Bring it on.

98
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,409
Who's there? Guy on the left is going to be picked off with an arrow.

99
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,690
Micah. Gentlemen.

100
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,779
The audio is delayed. I think so. Found a little homestead down that way.

101
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,029
Okay. Anyone home? Sure.

102
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,669
Place is blazing with light and noise. Sounded like a party.

103
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,269
Let's go see. Follow me.

104
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:56,549
How's Davey doing? I didn't make it, nor did little Jenny.

105
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,070
Six B's. Bob, Barry. Davey was a real fighter.

106
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,470
Both of them calendar boys is.

107
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,870
Bugle. Was. Yeah.

108
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,990
And Mac, Sean. We don't know.

109
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,870
A business.

110
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,659
All right, Micah. Ask him if he's seen John.

111
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,789
Have you seen John? John.

112
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,950
He's talking about our John. My John. First game, John.

113
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:43,210
Let me take the rear.

114
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,240
Double tap and hold while pushing.

115
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,120
How is it to hold? It just disappeared.

116
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,580
Talk to Mike. Are you sure about this?

117
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,200
Let's do that.

118
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,559
Mr. Morgan. I never thought I would be so pleased to see your face.

119
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,399
Things always turn out fine. Except for in Red Dead Redemption.

120
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,200
Where's everyone else? Old mining camp back up the hill.

121
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,960
Hung for daddy to put food on the table.

122
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,159
Gotta love these graphics, though.

123
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,159
You said it before. We got too many mouths to feed.

124
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Snow actually permeates.

125
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,919
So you should be happy.

126
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,360
That ain't fair, Arthur. I earn my share.

127
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
I keep saying people tell me to keep looking at the balls.

128
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,879
Think it's unreasonable to expect others to do the same.

129
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,200
I wouldn't do that in real life. Why would I do that in a video game?

130
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,720
If I was in this time period, I wouldn't go underneath the carriage like it was an oil change.

131
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,639
And lift up the tail and look at the ball sack.

132
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,440
What are you talking about?

133
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,279
You know me. I'm a good boy.

134
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,929
You look under your car and look for your car's balls?

135
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,929
What would be the car balls? I'm trying to think what it would be.

136
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,460
The car balls would be like the muffler, right?

137
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,180
Okay. Let's keep it down now, gentlemen. It's just up ahead.

138
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,420
I'm getting exhausted.

139
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,609
Turn it down.

140
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,059
Let's head down there.

141
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:33,380
I can't fall off this, can I?

142
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,849
Health is displayed in the lower left corner.

143
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,609
That tiny little thing is health?

144
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,529
That's so small. How am I supposed to see that?

145
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,690
Wait, is this like Super Mario?

146
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,849
Where there's like three quadrants?

147
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,289
Let's hitch up here.

148
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,059
The outer bar shows it.

149
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:01,079
All right. But that was like about an outer bar and an inner bar.

150
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,579
Approach the hitching post.

151
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,380
Let's get it on here.

152
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,339
Triangle hitches the horse.

153
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,839
Now we got our first set of action here, I think.

154
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,200
You don't want to scare these folks.

155
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,740
Follow Dutch.

156
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,460
I remember Dutch.

157
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,299
Sounds like quite the party.

158
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,279
This is a lot of snow.

159
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,740
You too. Get yourself out of sight.

160
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,940
One of them is a lot less intimidating than three nasty-looking degenerates.

161
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,299
My father?

162
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,900
In that cattle shed on the left.

163
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,339
Micah, get down behind that wagon.

164
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:50,779
Why does this have to follow me everywhere I go?

165
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:51,740
I don't understand.

166
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,420
I said get out of sight.

167
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,660
Go to the shed and press R1.

168
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,140
Take cover.

169
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,660
There's this shed over here.

170
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,730
Arthur, take cover in that shed over there.

171
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,849
Glad it took three weeks.

172
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,650
Blame Cox Communications.

173
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,220
Because these motherfuckers can't figure it out either.

174
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,299
And it's their service.

175
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,819
This is the shed, right?

176
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,619
There.

177
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,019
It's not.

178
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,140
We're in the cattle shed.

179
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,180
Oh, the cattle shed.

180
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,880
Like in this thing.

181
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,880
This is not the cattle shed.

182
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,740
Get up there.

183
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,339
Did I just take my glasses off?

184
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,119
How do I get out of here?

185
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,519
I'm sorry.

186
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,799
I haven't been paying attention.

187
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,000
Get in position.

188
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,150
What cattle shed is he's referring to?

189
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,630
In here?

190
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:58,839
This is not the shed?

191
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:09,019
Stuck because no blip.

192
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:13,259
No, stuck because I have to look over here and watch 5% of every frame drop.

193
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,819
Because it's taken this company three weeks to try to fix a problem.

194
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,900
Oh my fucking god.

195
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,779
It's infuriating.

196
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:30,200
Go back.

197
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Go to the shed.

198
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,900
Is it the shed that's like straight in front of me here?

199
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,940
That looked like a cattle shed to me.

200
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,299
The huge yellow thing.

201
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:44,740
That's, isn't that where it just was?

202
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,029
Like isn't this, this is where I was.

203
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,910
Isn't this where I was?

204
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,549
Highlighted in yellow.

205
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,390
This thing here, isn't this where it just was?

206
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:56,549
I just did this.

207
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,019
Didn't I just do this?

208
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,559
I didn't hide.

209
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:23,450
A gentleman.

210
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,250
There goes Michael.

211
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,769
We can't help you, mister.

212
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:26,410
What's he going to do?

213
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,569
I got, folks.

214
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:30,940
Arthur, we got a problem.

215
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:39,430
Just me, so do you.

216
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,910
Protect Dutch.

217
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,470
Okay.

218
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,390
Is this guy going to fire at him?

219
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,599
I think you should go now.

220
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:54,460
Crap.

221
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,099
Bunch.

222
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:12,549
I just like, holy shit, this is aiming is a little weird.

223
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,769
What's with the aiming?

224
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,220
It's like, why is it pulling me?

225
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:32,390
I got to change the sensitivity here.

226
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:43,049
Great soundtrack, yeah?

227
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,509
All right.

228
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:47,829
Where is it?

229
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:48,150
This way?

230
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:54,859
He's not going to last by himself out there.

231
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,079
Now he won't last at all.

232
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,000
You didn't handle it.

233
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,039
I had to do something about it.

234
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm not going to follow him.

235
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,700
Fucking internet companies, man.

236
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:32,890
Hold square near items to pick them up by searching the house.

237
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,210
Okay.

238
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:36,009
Medicine.

239
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,450
Whiskey.

240
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:42,579
They're going to open pots and shit?

241
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:46,470
It's just cabinets.

242
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,289
Hold near items to pick them up while searching.

243
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,490
A can of sweet corn.

244
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,369
Maybe they're hiding up here, too.

245
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,890
There's a big price on Cuomo Drisco's head.

246
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,009
Assorted biscuits.

247
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,349
Here's as big as a one on you.

248
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:03,670
Fruits.

249
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,190
You're probably the only thing me is.

250
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,309
Whiskey is not essential?

251
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,349
Wait, are you serious?

252
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,670
Your health core drains over time and is now empty.

253
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,869
Well, empty you will experience negative effects.

254
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,390
Do you need something now?

255
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,549
Get your strength up for the ride back.

256
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:17,769
Do you have to eat in this game?

257
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,650
Okay.

258
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,170
Slightly restores health core and moderately restores stamina core.

259
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,299
Interesting.

260
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,750
And then we have to go bake beans so that back in the middle is your core.

261
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,099
Slightly restores health core.

262
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:38,420
All right.

263
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:43,369
Let's just do this in the middle one first.

264
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:44,089
Let's just try it out.

265
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:48,170
Survival mode?

266
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:48,809
It seems like it.

267
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:53,960
Delicious, dry, warm, and inject down here.

268
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
Maybe we'll see how they are when we head back.

269
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,559
Better quality food will refill more core.

270
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,390
I don't really want us to split up.

271
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,190
Okay.

272
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,029
I got to refill my four cores.

273
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:13,880
Let's look around for some more stuff.

274
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,829
Just controls how fast you refill your health and stamina.

275
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:26,980
Better than nothing.

276
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,079
There's a lot of random shit on the mantle.

277
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,210
Examine the photograph.

278
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,450
Sure.

279
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:36,970
Let's get some lore.

280
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,210
Poor bastard was married to.

281
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,900
Okay.

282
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,180
Flip it around.

283
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,059
Secret code in the back.

284
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,359
Quake and Idy wedding.

285
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,430
Jett's tonbri.

286
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,829
I can't read it.

287
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,460
Oh, there we go.

288
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,859
Okay.

289
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,049
I'm just kidding.

290
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,539
Oh, look.

291
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,660
It's from the first game.

292
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,099
That's the cottage from the first game.

293
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:14,819
All right.

294
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:23,259
What's we got?

295
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,460
Two dollars and 43 cents.

296
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,339
Have we dropped a frame in the last, like, 15 minutes?

297
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:28,980
Can anybody tell?

298
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,319
Or do I have to, like,

299
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,319
or do I have to, like, scream as loud as I can?

300
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,710
I have?

301
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,349
God damn it.

302
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,029
Well, I say it now and now I just did right here.

303
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,700
I think that's all I can get.

304
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,289
Arthur, keep looking for stuff.

305
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,380
Arthur, go see if there's anything in that barn.

306
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,339
Okay.

307
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:02,259
Micah, you search the cabin.

308
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,140
See what we missed.

309
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,339
Sure.

310
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,569
All right, let's go.

311
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,759
Investigate the barn.

312
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,839
I'm going to go take a look and I'm going to go examine it.

313
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,319
No drop frames since the fight.

314
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,599
Now you can look at the current objective.

315
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,299
What's that?

316
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,380
Is that a bad guy, good guy thing there?

317
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:28,170
The atmosphere is great.

318
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,650
Yeah.

319
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,609
So far it looks awesome.

320
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,720
That guy just top roped you.

321
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,240
Ha, ha, ha.

322
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,279
Hey, what's happening in here?

323
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:53,269
That guy didn't get one hit in.

324
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,630
Should you kill him?

325
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,190
Interrogate.

326
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:02,140
All right, beat him.

327
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,789
This is just like the Punisher game.

328
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,140
Where is he?

329
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:11,420
Where is he?

330
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,250
Okay.

331
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:22,089
Anything else?

332
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:34,680
Thanks for the info, buddy.

333
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,720
Anything else?

334
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,400
What was the last time you shit your pants?

335
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,720
Joe!

336
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,380
When did it happen?

337
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,200
When?

338
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,680
When was the last time you shit your pants?

339
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:06,039
Let's try to grab him again.

340
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,019
He's like, come here, I'm not done with you.

341
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:16,039
Oh, there are animals over here?

342
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,720
What the fuck?

343
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:19,940
What's happening?

344
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,140
I have to restart the whole thing?

345
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,200
Oh, shit.

346
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:33,690
Wasted.

347
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,410
By walking out of the frame.

348
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,240
Oh, god damn it.

349
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,140
Well, all right.

350
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,849
Tell us, tell us again.

351
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,289
First passing hug.

352
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,089
I can't keep up.

353
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,259
His clothes changed?

354
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,559
Fiction to rob some train.

355
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,480
Gonna blow the tracks.

356
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,940
I don't know the net, I swear.

357
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,460
There were, that's his worst mission boundaries than in GTA V.

358
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,420
Well, I would say it looks like you have this, Arthur.

359
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,460
Do what you want with him.

360
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,900
All right, so now we get a second chance.

361
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,619
Should I spare him?

362
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,539
This guy, remember saving Private Ryan.

363
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,940
This motherfucker's gonna come back.

364
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,890
I don't want to do that.

365
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,769
But what if he comes back?

366
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:40,390
Where's my gun?

367
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:47,769
Focus on the horse.

368
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,410
Where are you?

369
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:55,769
In the barn?

370
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,509
How'd you get in here?

371
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,579
How did you get in here?

372
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,579
Well, I can, oh, I can calm the horse.

373
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,539
This is not my horse.

374
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,819
What, is this gonna freak out and start hitting me?

375
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,500
This looks animatronic.

376
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,380
I don't know if I trust it.

377
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,099
It's animatronic.

378
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,039
Don't ever stand behind a horse.

379
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:28,839
That's what I was told.

380
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,349
Check his balls, no.

381
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,720
All right, let's lead the horse.

382
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,849
Continuing to bond with your horse

383
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:45,849
increases its trust in you and improves its attributes.

384
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:55,799
The horse has now become your horse

385
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,599
as indicated by a blip on the radar.

386
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,839
Okay.

387
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,700
We still fucking drop, yeah.

388
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,079
God damn it.

389
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,119
This is like, I'm like really containing myself right now.

390
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,759
I'm like, I have like a, I'm holding back.

391
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,940
But this has been like an infuriating process.

392
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,859
Literally moved across the country

393
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,059
to a different fucking state.

394
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:48,069
Got a faster line and it's worse than it was before.

395
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,160
That's unbelievable.

396
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,640
With a different company.

397
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,220
A gigabit connection.

398
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:12,759
Thousand fucking megabits a second.

399
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,960
Eventually it's gonna get fixed,

400
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,160
but who fucking knows when.

401
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,339
Maybe you're the problem.

402
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,059
I don't think so.

403
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,819
I haven't had enough time to be the problem.

404
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,160
Turned on the modem, got an IP.

405
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,660
That's it.

406
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:45,029
Oh, what the fuck?

407
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:46,809
Get off me.

408
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,549
Okay.

409
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,950
Hold on.

410
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,589
Come in here, boy.

411
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:49,990
Let's go.

412
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,019
Just keep going west until you get there.

413
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,489
It is going to be okay.

414
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,849
We mean you no harm.

415
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:25,000
Miss, come on.

416
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,219
It'll be okay.

417
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,320
We need to get out of here and quick.

418
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:30,519
Come on.

419
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,019
Fire.

420
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,940
You okay, miss?

421
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,500
Three days ago.

422
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,139
My internet's acting up because I clicked on your screen.

423
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,260
Miss, you are safe now.

424
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,059
And you can't stay here.

425
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,099
I mean that fire wasn't bad.

426
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,099
You could just jump on that thing and roll around

427
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:53,900
and it would have gone off.

428
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,619
You come with us.

429
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:55,679
Of course.

430
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,019
Miss, it's okay.

431
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,019
We're bad men.

432
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,980
We ain't them.

433
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:05,860
It's okay.

434
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,480
Get on.

435
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,219
We'll keep you safe until you figure out what you want to do.

436
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,789
What's your name, miss?

437
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,050
Miss.

438
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,650
Adler.

439
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,849
Adler.

440
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,099
What is it that Dory's been burning easy during a blizzard?

441
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:23,599
Mrs.

442
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,980
I...

443
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,179
He...

444
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,219
He was my husband.

445
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,389
Hey, somebody's coming.

446
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:56,170
Looks like it's Dutch.

447
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,570
Hey, everybody, Dutch is back.

448
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,369
We good.

449
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:00,329
How'd you get on?

450
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,210
Micah found a homestead, but he weren't the first.

451
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,889
Colm or Driscoll and his scum, they beat us to it.

452
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,050
We found some of them there,

453
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:18,679
but there is more about, apparently, scouting the train.

454
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:19,980
Thank you.

455
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,679
And that's the last thing we need right now, Dutch.

456
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,280
Well, it is what it is.

457
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,760
But we found some supplies, some blankets, a little bit of food.

458
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,400
And this poor soul, Mrs. Adler,

459
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,599
Miss Tilly, Miss Karen, would you warm her up?

460
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,800
Give her a drink or something.

461
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,280
And Mrs. Adler, it's gonna be okay.

462
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,320
You're safe now.

463
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,199
They turned her into a widow.

464
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,360
He might never be on PC, but the last one wasn't either.

465
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,039
That's like the unfortunate thing.

466
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,639
I need some rest. I haven't slept in three days.

467
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,960
You're over here.

468
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Miss O'Shea will show you the way.

469
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,360
Mr. Morgan, we put you in a room over here.

470
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,760
Thank you, Miss Grimshaw.

471
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,679
Mr. Bell, you're with the fellas over there.

472
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,719
Well, how come Arthur gets a room

473
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,280
and I get a bunk bed next to Bill Williamson

474
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,880
and a bunch of darkies?

475
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,079
Get yourself to bed.

476
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:19,739
The rocks are a bunch of idiots for not putting it on PC.

477
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:22,320
Yeah, I don't know.

478
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,159
There's gotta be some reason why.

479
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,559
I think there's not, but I really wonder.

480
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,159
He ain't been seen in days where there ain't let up.

481
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,699
He's strong and he's smart.

482
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:37,500
Strong, at least.

483
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:39,260
Hello, Arthur.

484
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:40,780
Abigail.

485
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,739
Arthur, how you doing?

486
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,539
Just fine, Abigail.

487
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,739
And you?

488
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:50,510
I need you to...

489
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:53,070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to ask, but...

490
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,510
It's little John.

491
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,070
He's got himself caught into a scrape again.

492
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,670
He ain't been seen in two...

493
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,510
Hours.

494
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,230
Two days.

495
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,909
Your John will be fine.

496
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,429
I mean, he may be as dumb as rocks

497
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,190
and as dull as rusted iron,

498
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,190
but that ain't changing because

499
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,030
he got caught in some snowstorm.

500
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,070
Please go take a look.

501
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,349
Javier?

502
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,230
Yes.

503
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,110
Javier, will you ride out with Arthur

504
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,309
to take a look for John?

505
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,030
You're the two best fit men we've got.

506
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:22,909
Now?

507
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:24,269
She's...

508
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:25,469
We're all...

509
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,909
Yeah, we're pretty worried about him.

510
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:32,510
I know the situation were reversed

511
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,320
and he looked for me.

512
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,320
Thank you.

513
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,010
Is he in a British accent?

514
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,820
This way.

515
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,820
Last I know, John was headed up the river.

516
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:51,679
We know he kept riding north.

517
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,719
Not like that.

518
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,079
That emote is making my chat scroll horizontally.

519
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,159
Wait, what?

520
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,280
Wait, what?

521
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,920
Wait, hold on.

522
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:06,510
What are you talking about?

523
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,750
It's time to find John Mar...

524
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,030
All right, I need to like get happy.

525
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,230
I'm like sad right now

526
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,750
because of this internet bullshit.

527
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,989
I gotta get like excited.

528
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,429
This is Red Dead Redemption 2.

529
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,070
This is not like...

530
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,389
This is not an iPad game.

531
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,139
Hey, I see some smoke.

532
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,340
Come on, let's take a look.

533
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,539
Let's hope it ain't more of O'Driscoll's boys.

534
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:38,780
Seems somebody left.

535
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,940
All right, let's do some investigating.

536
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,579
Reporting here.

537
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,030
Did he do it?

538
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,510
Did he do it?

539
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:46,909
Did he do it?

540
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:47,230
Did he do it?

541
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,710
Did he do it?

542
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,869
Are we not going to like it anyways?

543
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:50,110
What?

544
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,349
What?

545
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,230
I loved the first one.

546
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,190
The first one was great.

547
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,230
Let's inspect the camp.

548
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,119
There could be dust.

549
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,239
There could be fingerprints.

550
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,360
There's finger dust on here.

551
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,550
That's fine.

552
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,469
All right, fine, fine, fine.

553
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,219
I wanted to fucking dust for fingerprints

554
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,019
and you didn't want to do shit.

555
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,670
Watch out.

556
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,070
Watch out.

557
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,190
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

558
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,309
Burning, burning, burn.

559
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:24,269
Burn my horse's legs.

560
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:36,590
Stamina drains when your horse gallops or jumps.

561
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,789
I can't see anything.

562
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:38,590
We had the money.

563
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,389
It seemed fine.

564
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,789
Somebody turn the antennas around.

565
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:43,550
Bounty hunters?

566
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,989
No, Pinkerton's.

567
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,280
It was crazy.

568
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,639
Raining bullets.

569
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:50,269
That lake was steaming.

570
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,519
Well, this is a beautiful mountain though.

571
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,199
Watch out for this crevice.

572
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,840
To change camera distance and perspective, press.

573
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:09,309
It wouldn't even let me do the YouTuber joke.

574
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:09,710
Come on.

575
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,110
Why?

576
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,510
Come on.

577
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,340
Oh, sorry.

578
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,380
I got off track.

579
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,559
Let me just look.

580
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:21,599
Whoa.

581
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:31,159
Oh, you can't.

582
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,280
Hold on.

583
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Wait, you can't.

584
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,780
Oh.

585
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:42,269
The horse wouldn't do it.

586
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:45,440
But you get off and you can do it.

587
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,119
Horse is smarter.

588
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,719
See, they continue up that way.

589
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,039
That fall was so stupid, too.

590
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,639
It was like he lost control of all of his body and function.

591
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,760
You tell me.

592
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,079
And that like, ah!

593
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,920
It was like Emperor Palpatine.

594
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,719
Let's just see where they lead.

595
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,519
Thrown into the thing in the end of the fourth movie.

596
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,320
He just did the Emperor Palpatine scream.

597
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,679
What really happened?

598
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,739
We had the money.

599
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,619
It seemed fine.

600
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,420
Then suddenly they were everywhere.

601
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,409
Hunters?

602
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,610
No, Pinkerton.

603
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,469
It was crazy.

604
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,820
All right, so I got the stamina bar.

605
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:26,139
The horse bar has the horseshoe.

606
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,510
Okay, so that's distance.

607
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,550
That's what I want.

608
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,429
Killed a girl in a boat.

609
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:33,230
FPS boat.

610
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:34,510
Bad way.

611
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,420
But it was a bad situation.

612
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,860
That ain't like him, though.

613
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:40,860
Okay, not gonna do it.

614
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:59,849
There's some tracks leading to the river.

615
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,449
It's not funny.

616
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,570
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,579
It's not funny.

618
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:08,780
Wait, that was a bear?

619
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,420
What are you talking about?

620
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,900
A bear?

621
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:14,300
That was, I was trying to turn around

622
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,340
because I was making the fake.

623
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:17,579
It's not funny.

624
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:18,780
It is funny.

625
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,460
It is funny.

626
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,860
Whatever.

627
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,179
You were there, Javi.

628
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:23,900
It was a bear?

629
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,860
I don't think it was a bear.

630
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:26,460
We had the money.

631
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,260
It seemed fine.

632
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,099
Was it a bear?

633
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:29,900
Then suddenly they were everywhere.

634
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,139
Then suddenly they were everywhere.

635
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:31,800
Turning hunters?

636
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,679
No, Pinkerton.

637
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,489
It was crazy.

638
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,880
Oh, it's not funny.

639
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,599
Please stop.

640
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,239
I'm sorry.

641
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,570
Take it slow.

642
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,690
Big ravine here.

643
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,969
Get me, I'm not going over there.

644
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,260
Dutch killed a girl.

645
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,980
My side.

646
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:51,099
Bad way.

647
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,579
But it was a bad situation.

648
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:55,980
That ain't like him, though.

649
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:02,250
Tracks go left, down here.

650
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,199
Javi got shot.

651
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:09,960
I'm not doing it one more time.

652
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,840
Both shot too.

653
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,920
Sean, we don't even know.

654
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,130
I'm surprised we escaped at all.

655
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,929
By the time you boys showed up from the other side of town,

656
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:23,900
I'm only just holding my business all right.

657
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:27,360
Activate cinematic camera.

658
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,239
Hold this button down.

659
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,239
Damn, snow's coming in hard again.

660
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:30,880
That's cool.

661
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,800
We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.

662
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,079
Automatically follow roads.

663
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,079
Oh, let's see.

664
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,760
It's like watching an actual movie.

665
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,280
Nice.

666
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,500
Change cinematic camera, press R3.

667
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,239
All right, there's a lot of use cases for this, I think.

668
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:55,210
But am I still controlling the character?

669
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,030
Oh, shit.

670
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,829
Yeah, I am.

671
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,880
That's hard to do.

672
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:15,119
All right, I'm going to play the whole game like this.

673
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,360
I'm going to be the first streamer on Twitch.

674
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,199
The first guy on Twitch to do it only in cinematic mode.

675
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:36,079
Looks like you know when you were 14 and you made that machinima.

676
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,690
That's what I'm doing right now.

677
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:49,449
I'm not going to turn it off.

678
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,820
Why would I turn this off?

679
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:02,760
Oh, wow.

680
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,559
Let's investigate.

681
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,440
Let's see if he can hear us.

682
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,559
He was riding this horse.

683
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,400
Help.

684
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,719
Where?

685
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:15,929
Up here.

686
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,690
I heard it from this way.

687
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:28,320
Is this the right way?

688
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,360
Am I going the fuck?

689
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,670
I gotta get it out of my system now.

690
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,789
Oh, shit.

691
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:44,269
Okay, don't.

692
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,389
Okay, no, no, no, no.

693
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,110
Just relax.

694
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,349
I'm not going to fucking do it again.

695
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:54,989
I'm sorry.

696
00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:57,500
Do you think it's John?

697
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,860
You tell me tracks for sure.

698
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,639
But it could be anyone.

699
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:10,920
I have like the cinematic mode.

700
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,239
I'm trying.

701
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:12,119
I can't do it yet.

702
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,000
That's give me the money.

703
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,880
It seemed fine.

704
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,360
And suddenly there were everywhere.

705
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:20,039
It's five minutes to get fun though.

706
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:20,840
It was crazy.

707
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,800
I'm actually going to try to play the whole game in cinematic mode.

708
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,960
That'll be my schnick, right?

709
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,840
Like what the fuck?

710
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:32,519
Live stream replace entire Red Dead 2 in cinematic camera.

711
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,750
Okay, here we go.

712
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,130
No, I'm not.

713
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:45,690
I'm not going to jump.

714
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,449
I'm not falling off another edge.

715
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,210
That is a 100% guarantee.

716
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,849
Like I can 100% guarantee.

717
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,650
If I fall off the edge in the next like minute or two

718
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,090
in this like little tutorial,

719
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,170
I will do 100 pushups in a row.

720
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:04,650
On camera.

721
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,599
Take the germ attacks 30%.

722
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:33,119
It adds the bars to that support.

723
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,840
I'm not going to fall.

724
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,440
I'm doing the thing that's impossible.

725
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,199
You cannot fall like this.

726
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,409
It's not possible.

727
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,159
I'm holding X.

728
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,079
I'm tensed up right now.

729
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,039
Like you wouldn't believe.

730
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
I like this one.

731
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,480
How am I going to aim and shoot at people with cinematic camera?

732
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,920
Is that possible?

733
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,260
So close to the edge, yeah.

734
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,260
She has to guess.

735
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,340
I can't just guess.

736
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,650
This is beautiful though.

737
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:44,119
Let's get a different angle here.

738
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,159
Let's see if he can hear us.

739
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,849
So John is here somewhere.

740
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,320
All right, I'm going to follow him.

741
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,159
Up there.

742
00:49:58,159 --> 00:49:58,960
Don't say up there.

743
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,960
Like I'm going to follow you.

744
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,639
Don't push me off.

745
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,750
All right.

746
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:09,789
Here we go.

747
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,519
Is it do I go over this?

748
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:16,730
All right, we're good.

749
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,050
We have to walk from here.

750
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,289
Oh no.

751
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:24,329
Oh no.

752
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:27,449
Grab shotgun.

753
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,880
Force weapons.

754
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,590
Okay, so our R1.

755
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,949
Okay, we can only have one sidearm.

756
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:40,829
So I'm going to get the shotgun.

757
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:47,710
So did I lose cinematic?

758
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,079
There we go.

759
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:49,559
It's back.

760
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:50,039
Wait, hold on.

761
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,239
Okay.

762
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,880
Oh, it turns off right when you hold the button down.

763
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:02,619
You can't do it.

764
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:03,900
But wait, is this an edge?

765
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:08,190
Okay, we're good.

766
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:16,619
It's on.

767
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:16,940
It's on.

768
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,840
I'm not cheating.

769
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,639
I want to see from another angle.

770
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:30,840
I don't want to see.

771
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,400
Holy fuck.

772
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,599
I just that doesn't count.

773
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,199
I fell off a ledge onto another ledge.

774
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:34,679
I didn't die.

775
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:43,949
Stamina displayed in the lower left corner.

776
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:44,989
I don't have a cinematic.

777
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,309
Okay.

778
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,510
This doesn't count either because this is...

779
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:50,780
Okay.

780
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:57,639
Oh god damn it.

781
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,570
Yeah, I'm all right.

782
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,769
This is the most stressful thing I've done in a long time.

783
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,250
Am I running the lip?

784
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,329
My stamina core is empty.

785
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:36,349
Square in this climb.

786
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,519
Get access to the shaft.

787
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:39,719
I need to eat something, man.

788
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,099
So I need some stamina here.

789
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,119
Classic oat cakes.

790
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:52,139
Is there just a stamina one?

791
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,400
Just canned peaches is fine.

792
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:10,670
I thought I just fucked it up.

793
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:16,570
That looks odd from cinematic view.

794
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:21,929
All right, we're doing fine.

795
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:30,170
Just eating peaches.

796
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,610
Canned peaches are where it's at, man.

797
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,369
That's good shit.

798
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:42,250
John?

799
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:46,139
John?

800
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:48,059
John, we'll be looking for you.

801
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:51,900
John, the streetlights are on.

802
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,340
You're in deep shit when you get home.

803
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:56,619
Where is he?

804
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:05,880
He's in the game.

805
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,519
He's in the game.

806
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:10,269
Where is he?

807
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,239
So he is in the game.

808
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:22,559
Wow.

809
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,409
I could probably do that if I tried hard enough.

810
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:47,579
All right, now we've got to cinematically walk him back to his car.

811
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:51,420
Oh, we actually do.

812
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,840
I think this is just supposed to happen, right?

813
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,679
If we go on the right, is this supposed to be okay?

814
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:21,920
Uh-oh.

815
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:23,760
Wildlife.

816
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,130
We're being hunted by wolves.

817
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,969
Who's going to distract them?

818
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:38,489
All right, we got to get to the horses.

819
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:40,809
Keep the wolves away from both of them.

820
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:47,199
That's just not going to work.

821
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,639
No, it takes it off cinematic mode.

822
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,239
Oh, well, we tried.

823
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,639
Get him on the horse.

824
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:25,519
You can see he's going to drive him.

825
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,199
Do first person mode.

826
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:33,320
That's actually a good idea, too.

827
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:38,170
Okay.

828
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:44,829
Where is he?

829
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:47,880
Oh, shit.

830
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,510
All right, yee-haw.

831
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,550
We're kind of going to yee-haw.

832
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,639
Please don't commit to this.

833
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:02,840
I'm not committing to it.

834
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,719
Now or later.

835
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,960
Are you going to die?

836
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,440
This is not very cinematic.

837
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:18,360
Up there?

838
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,480
More of them!

839
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:30,940
Get out of here!

840
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,800
Shit, there's more on the right!

841
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:42,840
That ragged off.

842
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,719
Do you see any more, Arthur?

843
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,019
I don't think so.

844
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,940
Jesus.

845
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,380
He just buried his face in the ground.

846
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,260
Just slid.

847
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,380
Just about.

848
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,820
You're going to be okay.

849
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,260
We have some shelter now.

850
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:53,659
All right, we're good.

851
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:55,340
Thanks for coming for me.

852
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,659
Of course.

853
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:56,860
Is this the portal soundtrack?

854
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,059
That bullet in Blackwater.

855
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:58,619
Now this.

856
00:57:58,619 --> 00:57:59,260
I don't think so.

857
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,539
You had a hell of a time.

858
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:01,900
And Arthur always says,

859
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:03,579
I'm lucky.

860
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,139
None of us are lucky right now.

861
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:08,139
It's really crazy that John Marsden's in this game

862
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,139
and he just becomes Darth Vader in the next one.

863
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,780
You get to see his origin story here.

864
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,260
That's really cool.

865
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,780
Ride in the water for a bit.

866
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,820
Try to lose a cent.

867
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:18,780
Don't want to leave a trail right back to camp.

868
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,500
You know, we're going to need to come up with

869
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
a better story for that scar.

870
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,980
So, freezing, bleeding, starving.

871
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,380
Damn, they're getting even to death.

872
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,579
They're good enough for you.

873
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,079
Dude, oops.

874
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,400
We're good.

875
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,119
I did it.

876
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:42,599
I made it.

877
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,659
Super horse.

878
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:06,219
Can I scream too?

879
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:06,699
Does it help?

880
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:15,329
Help.

881
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,159
One, two, three.

882
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,519
Even by your standards.

883
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:30,360
Thank you, Arthur.

884
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,480
Thank you.

885
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,119
Any other lost maidens need saving?

886
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:35,719
Not today.

887
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,480
Have you and Dutch talked about how we're gonna get out of this?

888
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,119
I was just discussing with Herr Strauss

889
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,000
when the weather breaks.

890
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,079
I suppose we'll have to keep heading east.

891
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:45,800
East?

892
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,519
Into all that?

893
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,599
That civilization.

894
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:49,079
I know.

895
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,119
The west is where our problems are worse.

896
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:53,000
The west.

897
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,199
Come on, Herr Strauss.

898
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,400
Let's get warm.

899
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,440
Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

900
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,079
You've never seen this game before?

901
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,119
Is it on the Sega Genesis?

902
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,539
I was just gonna scream, yes.

903
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:19,500
But I'm not a screamer.

904
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,210
Events and interesting locations are noted in your journal as you explore.

905
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,050
Hold W to view.

906
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,530
Hold X for details.

907
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:38,480
Log.

908
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,119
Enter.

909
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:39,840
Pursue by memory.

910
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,320
John hasn't returned from an earlier scouting trip.

911
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,920
Arthur and Javier ride out into the snow to look for him.

912
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,119
Okay.

913
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,840
Checklist.

914
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,280
Kill all the wolves without taking any damage.

915
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,119
Complete what Elise 80 didn't do either of those.

916
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,699
That's all right.

917
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:55,420
Let's take a look at this.

918
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:56,860
Here's the journal.

919
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,079
That's very bad drawing.

920
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,519
You know when somebody asks you for directions

921
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,480
and you draw them a terrible map of intersections?

922
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,400
What's it just looks like?

923
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,809
Uh, okay.

924
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,090
I just draw in here, too?

925
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:24,489
What is this book?

926
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:31,019
Why would I not use this piece of paper on the left?

927
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,940
It's a waste of trees.

928
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,059
Is this the White House?

929
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:43,369
Oh, okay.

930
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:44,090
Blacksmithing.

931
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:47,920
I can't read this.

932
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,659
Oh, thank God it can be translated.

933
01:01:58,269 --> 01:01:58,989
That's kind of cool.

934
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:05,849
Continue playing to unlock your bonus content.

935
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,750
Oh, I'm one of the suckers that spent $80

936
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,989
to get like the one mission that nobody else gets.

937
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:15,690
I feel real great about that part, just by the way.

938
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:26,090
All right.

939
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,650
Let's just go.

940
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,530
Let's just do some shit.

941
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:32,590
We got our mini-map here.

942
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:38,539
Got a horse, yeah.

943
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,530
Hold L2 to talk.

944
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:51,469
33-year-old substitute teacher can't read cursive.

945
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:05,960
Let's go.

946
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,429
I haven't been a substitute teacher in a long time.

947
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:13,420
All right.

948
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,139
All right, let's talk.

949
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:14,780
L2, greet.

950
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:18,699
Another cold morning.

951
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,400
What?

952
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,750
What is it doing?

953
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:36,360
Wait, why did it make me get off

954
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,320
for it to go to the bathroom?

955
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:37,960
Get over here.

956
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:39,719
What are you doing?

957
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:40,219
Hey!

958
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:42,039
Come here.

959
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:43,480
Come back here.

960
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:44,840
What are you going?

961
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,679
All right.

962
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:51,159
Relax.

963
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:56,030
Shit and run.

964
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,329
I guess we need to B or P.

965
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:04,250
Let's just do wits right here.

966
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:04,809
Let's just do P.

967
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,269
Couple of days on the lamb.

968
01:04:18,269 --> 01:04:19,309
You lot have all turned yellow.

969
01:04:19,309 --> 01:04:20,190
B or P?

970
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,710
Apart from you, of course.

971
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:22,590
Shut up, Micah.

972
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,070
I ain't never seen so many long faces.

973
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:29,230
I guess, I guess folks miss them.

974
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:29,789
I fell.

975
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:32,030
But when I fall, I don't want no fuss.

976
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,030
When you fall, there'll be a party.

977
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:36,909
A party?

978
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,269
Probably.

979
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:39,869
Funny, huh?

980
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,070
Sure.

981
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:48,110
I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two.

982
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,750
Stop it.

983
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:49,710
Now.

984
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,349
You fools punching each other

985
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:54,829
when Como Driscoll's needing punching.

986
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:55,469
Hard.

987
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:57,869
You want to sit around waiting for him to come find us?

988
01:04:58,429 --> 01:04:59,150
All of you.

989
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:00,429
We got work to do.

990
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,469
All right, I have the team mission.

991
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:02,829
You sure about this, Dutch?

992
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:03,389
Yes.

993
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:05,150
Folks been through a lot recently.

994
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,829
We hardly back on our feet yet.

995
01:05:06,829 --> 01:05:10,429
The last thing we need is to get bushwhacked by Como Driscoll.

996
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:13,230
I know you hate him, Dutch.

997
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,750
He's here for us.

998
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,789
I doubt that.

999
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:17,230
No, you're just doubting me.

1000
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,550
I would never doubt you, Dutch.

1001
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:24,590
You always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.

1002
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,829
This is a right call, Arthur.

1003
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:27,789
Take this.

1004
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:30,190
Why does he just sound like a pitch-shifted version of him?

1005
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:37,440
They were talking about trains, detonators.

1006
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,679
Here.

1007
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,239
Como always had good information.

1008
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:42,719
Come on.

1009
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,880
And you think now is the right time to hit a train.

1010
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,800
Now you, my fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit.

1011
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,360
I'm getting too old for that life.

1012
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,000
Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson.

1013
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Would you please look after the place there are Driscolls about?

1014
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,760
Voice crack, voice crack.

1015
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,960
How everyone laugh at him, right?

1016
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,159
That's what you laugh at me.

1017
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,840
That guy's way stronger than all of you.

1018
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,079
Everybody pointed out in the chat, right?

1019
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:24,590
We're going to go.

1020
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,309
This is a robbery.

1021
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:28,510
Automatic cinematic.

1022
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,070
I didn't even do it.

1023
01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:32,840
Somebody turn on the AC.

1024
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,880
It's getting hot in here.

1025
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,760
Automatic cinematic.

1026
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,360
I'll scold myself for that one later in the shower.

1027
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,400
I promise.

1028
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:47,630
I'm sorry.

1029
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:48,989
I've been away for like three weeks.

1030
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:55,400
I'm going to be in the shower being like with my hand up,

1031
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,159
wicked hot water just going like,

1032
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,119
fucking stupid.

1033
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,260
Don't ever say something like that again.

1034
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:06,860
It must be this way.

1035
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:11,150
You good, Dutch?

1036
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:16,539
Listen, I know you don't think much of my eyes recently,

1037
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:18,460
but this is the right move.

1038
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,289
Okay.

1039
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:19,769
Debatable.

1040
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:21,389
You know I'm going to be back.

1041
01:07:21,389 --> 01:07:22,510
Screaming in the shower.

1042
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:27,239
You learned a long time ago that you hit Como Driscolls.

1043
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:28,440
No drop frames, by the way.

1044
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,639
I get to get out of meltdown modem into fun, fun mode.

1045
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:37,340
This feud between you needs to be put to rest.

1046
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:45,920
One way or things I can forgive, I can forget.

1047
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,730
What he did to Hannibal, I can't deny it.

1048
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:55,690
For me to pull off on another like audibly upset.

1049
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,170
You know, like the difference when somebody's like,

1050
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,050
oh, I'm pissed off.

1051
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,090
What the heck, man?

1052
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,250
Whoa, I can't believe I died there.

1053
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,050
What's happening here?

1054
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:03,849
Oh, damn it.

1055
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,610
First, when you start talking like this,

1056
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,929
like this fucking stupid fucking thing.

1057
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:09,849
Like when you, that's how you know somebody's really angry.

1058
01:08:10,489 --> 01:08:12,170
They get like kind of internally,

1059
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,449
they're so hot and they're nervous and shit.

1060
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:14,809
Like they start fucking getting angry like that.

1061
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,649
It's not like, what the fuck?

1062
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,170
Whoa, I died in the game.

1063
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,130
Oh, I'm so mad.

1064
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:28,430
Whoa.

1065
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:33,789
Are we birds?

1066
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:34,590
All right, gentlemen.

1067
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:36,859
This is it.

1068
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:41,689
We goddamn ready.

1069
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:42,729
Ready, Dutch.

1070
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:43,529
Good.

1071
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:44,489
That was very, very good.

1072
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:45,529
That was like a classroom attendance.

1073
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:48,800
Miss Morgan and I, we're going to head up here a little.

1074
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,119
See if we can't get a sense of the layout of the camp.

1075
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:53,840
Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell.

1076
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,199
You two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.

1077
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,640
Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuela.

1078
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,960
You two hold position here.

1079
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,229
Let's go.

1080
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:10,170
All right.

1081
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:14,750
All right.

1082
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,550
Throw haymaker.

1083
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,439
I'm depleting.

1084
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,899
This is absolutely beautiful.

1085
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,020
You know, this is beautiful.

1086
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:33,739
It's just beautiful out here.

1087
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:34,939
That was at the same time.

1088
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,439
Holy shit, this is what it looks like to look through his eyes.

1089
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:43,079
I think so.

1090
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,199
Got to go to a doctor, man.

1091
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:45,960
Get into prescription.

1092
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:51,529
You got astigmatism, bro.

1093
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:56,829
All right.

1094
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:58,109
Head shot from all the way back here.

1095
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:08,140
What was wrong with that one?

1096
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,520
All right.

1097
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,560
So we're going to sneak up.

1098
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,000
Metal Gear Solid 3, neck snap.

1099
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,399
Two of them.

1100
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,810
I was hoping I could see his big eyes.

1101
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:42,970
Like Macaulay Culkin style.

1102
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:57,359
Weapons not set on your load before dismounting will remain on your horse.

1103
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,560
All right.

1104
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,949
So we got new...

1105
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:06,510
Hold on.

1106
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,229
Wait, wait, wait.

1107
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:10,170
Approach your horse to view store.

1108
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,050
Hold L.

1109
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,449
Do it.

1110
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:12,989
Okay.

1111
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:15,279
So where's the rifle?

1112
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,770
Right here.

1113
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:22,329
Long arm back carbine or carbine repeater.

1114
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:26,060
Oh, that's just the slot it's in.

1115
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,300
Okay.

1116
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,180
I get it.

1117
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:29,500
And I'll take the shotgun too.

1118
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:35,899
Horse weapons.

1119
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:40,029
We'll circle around the far side and go down that way.

1120
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:40,989
Same as Micah.

1121
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:41,470
Ten cents.

1122
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,949
Yeah, that's...

1123
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:42,510
I probably should.

1124
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:44,750
I'll get it right eventually.

1125
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,029
We can't afford.

1126
01:11:46,029 --> 01:11:46,670
Yeah.

1127
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,069
Just wasn't sure you agreed with me.

1128
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,829
Does it stay winter the whole game?

1129
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:53,789
Arthur, have you completely lost faith in me?

1130
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:59,069
Our needs right now are supplies, equipment, and a way out of here.

1131
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:02,029
Everything else, including coal.

1132
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:03,960
Okay.

1133
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,800
There's enough of those bastards down there to deal with as it is.

1134
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,069
All right.

1135
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:12,430
So we're going to go carbine.

1136
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,960
Not every area is snow.

1137
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,680
Well, it's good at least that they put it in.

1138
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,170
It's not just the desert and only the desert.

1139
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:29,659
Take a shot every time somebody says okay.

1140
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:34,430
All right.

1141
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,470
No fucking around here.

1142
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:37,869
No like look at how funny the streamer is jokes here.

1143
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,880
You know what I'm saying?

1144
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,760
And we already got that.

1145
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,880
We got a cinematic mode.

1146
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,600
Oh, LML.

1147
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,039
And then, oh, I fell off three times.

1148
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,439
And then, you know, I'm not doing that again.

1149
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:02,720
Can they see us?

1150
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:10,010
I should be crouched.

1151
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,810
I can't do it here.

1152
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,729
This is such a long walk down.

1153
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:17,210
Wait till I get the game to open up for me before I do any dumb shit.

1154
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,399
What a terrible stream.

1155
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:34,159
Hey, what?

1156
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:35,760
Why?

1157
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,319
What happened?

1158
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:38,239
I'm just playing Red Dead.

1159
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:43,130
Just jump off.

1160
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:54,270
No, one guy said that.

1161
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:56,159
Yeah.

1162
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,600
And he's the one guy now.

1163
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,960
Why do I always read negative feedback?

1164
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,880
Gosh, I need to make sure everyone's happy.

1165
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,760
And if people are not having fun, then I want to make sure you're having fun.

1166
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,250
I really can't fuck this up.

1167
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,260
I got to be on point here.

1168
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,979
No, like where's the shed?

1169
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:30,199
Is that the shed?

1170
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,479
Am I not dropping frames?

1171
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:32,119
I don't know.

1172
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:38,300
Is that a guy?

1173
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,020
No, that's a good guy.

1174
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:50,539
Take the lead.

1175
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,579
He's giving me an opportunity.

1176
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,760
Look at Dutch to give instructions.

1177
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:02,989
Send in the gang.

1178
01:15:02,989 --> 01:15:03,710
I'll take the lead.

1179
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:21,520
Wait, does the sniper elite thing?

1180
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,159
Damn it.

1181
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:40,840
Having R2 when not aiming.

1182
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,079
Okay.

1183
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:44,170
This is the last guy.

1184
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,609
Up on top of the roof.

1185
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:46,170
Don't fall.

1186
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,369
Oops, sorry.

1187
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:48,329
That guy was making a video.

1188
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:51,260
I should have been quiet.

1189
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,220
That guy was like recording.

1190
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,180
He's definitely like laughing and like screaming right now.

1191
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:01,390
Get over there.

1192
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:10,890
Fucking sensitivity.

1193
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:15,630
Lord.

1194
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:21,560
I got somebody.

1195
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:22,359
How?

1196
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:22,920
I'm not sure.

1197
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:40,090
Right through his hat.

1198
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,600
One more guy.

1199
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,000
Where is he?

1200
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,319
Right here?

1201
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh, he just got me right in the mouth.

1202
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,199
He shot me right in the face.

1203
01:16:52,520 --> 01:17:09,550
I'm glad you're getting shot right in the face like that.

1204
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:11,630
They're really just walled.

1205
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:23,310
Damn it.

1206
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:30,079
I could just be dead.

1207
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:30,239
What?

1208
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,279
Why did I shoot twice?

1209
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,319
Oh, that was the slow motion.

1210
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:37,119
FP.

1211
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,239
Oh, all right.

1212
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:39,680
Is this 90 FOV though?

1213
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,159
This just makes me want this to be on PC.

1214
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:45,279
All right.

1215
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,260
There's so many corpses though.

1216
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,060
How am I going to get them all?

1217
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:57,600
There is a slider in the menu.

1218
01:17:59,310 --> 01:17:59,710
Is there?

1219
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:04,960
What?

1220
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,439
A camera?

1221
01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:07,630
Or they aren't?

1222
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:07,869
Okay.

1223
01:18:07,869 --> 01:18:08,109
Yeah.

1224
01:18:08,109 --> 01:18:08,430
Okay.

1225
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:08,909
It is there.

1226
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,439
Get that fucking head bob off, please.

1227
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,279
All right.

1228
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:16,520
Cool.

1229
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,560
Is it a fly immediately?

1230
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:30,430
Actually, no FOV number.

1231
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:31,869
It's just this one.

1232
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,119
Bar.

1233
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,039
Bar drag to the edge.

1234
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:47,000
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,199
More of them are coming in right now.

1236
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,960
I didn't need a chance to loot.

1237
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:56,430
First person.

1238
01:18:57,069 --> 01:19:10,890
Well, aiming sure is a thousand times better in first person.

1239
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,250
I will definitely say that.

1240
01:19:13,369 --> 01:19:22,239
I'll say that.

1241
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:33,720
Defend.

1242
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,000
Is there?

1243
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,039
Is there a dead eye in this game?

1244
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:43,609
Damn.

1245
01:19:57,479 --> 01:19:58,750
Oh, there is dead eye.

1246
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,869
I can even like see it.

1247
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:02,640
Oh, shit.

1248
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,779
Got that guy.

1249
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:07,659
He's dead.

1250
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:09,579
I don't have to worry about him causing any problems.

1251
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:39,680
God.

1252
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:45,079
I don't like that.

1253
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,039
I didn't like that.

1254
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:47,079
Holy shit.

1255
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:57,050
Holy fuck.

1256
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,170
That was insane.

1257
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:02,840
All right.

1258
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:08,460
New.

1259
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,020
Oh, here we go.

1260
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:09,659
Weapon wheel.

1261
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,550
Dead eye tonics.

1262
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,750
Fully restores dead eye.

1263
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,069
Okay.

1264
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,909
You release to use them.

1265
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:17,760
Hides your identity while committing crimes.

1266
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,159
Okay.

1267
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:22,359
Let's bring it right back up.

1268
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:22,520
All right.

1269
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,319
Let's keep looking around.

1270
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:24,439
I got this many bodies.

1271
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:26,520
Do it with the shotgun.

1272
01:21:29,609 --> 01:21:29,930
Lord.

1273
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:31,930
He didn't like it.

1274
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:32,810
He loved it.

1275
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:38,880
They're probably going to keep coming over here.

1276
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,840
I guess I have to do it.

1277
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:49,930
Is this like you can actually cut people's heads off in the game?

1278
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:51,710
My lord.

1279
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:58,079
Shoot the bodies with the shotgun.

1280
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:09,239
Oh, man.

1281
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:14,039
No way.

1282
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,039
No fucking way.

1283
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:19,079
There's like this.

1284
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:20,279
That's that's insane.

1285
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,180
That's it's just it's brutal.

1286
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,859
Oh, man.

1287
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,300
It's bruises brutal.

1288
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,789
This game ain't coming out in Germany.

1289
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:33,609
Like no way.

1290
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:38,239
This game ain't going to release in Japan.

1291
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,399
Is it all right?

1292
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:49,920
Is it out in like Germany and Japan?

1293
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:52,189
What do they do?

1294
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,439
It is out.

1295
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:06,680
Okay.

1296
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:13,979
Blood confirmed it is out in Germany as is.

1297
01:23:15,819 --> 01:23:20,590
Well, hold on.

1298
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,949
Yeah, I have to loot everybody.

1299
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:23,550
You can't give me all these exes here.

1300
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,850
Got somebody's belt buckle.

1301
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,000
I will but just hold on.

1302
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,600
There's a lot that could be money on everybody.

1303
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:44,409
89 cents.

1304
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,649
I'm just collecting bits right now.

1305
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,189
What does this guy have?

1306
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,149
What does this guy have on him?

1307
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,720
Hey, thank you for the championship belt.

1308
01:23:56,989 --> 01:23:57,550
Big bits.

1309
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:57,949
All right.

1310
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:59,630
We'll look for like like come on.

1311
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,109
What do you got?

1312
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,460
No, that guy's not even that guy's not a sub.

1313
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,560
Come on.

1314
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,600
We don't even have like a sub.

1315
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:17,260
What?

1316
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,800
How many people here aren't even shocked?

1317
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,010
All right.

1318
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:24,970
I gotta cut that out.

1319
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,199
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1320
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,319
All right.

1321
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,060
We got here.

1322
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,020
He's onto it.

1323
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:42,170
Because he's I'm just I'm not.

1324
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:45,130
No, I don't I don't care if you aren't subscribed.

1325
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:47,529
Don't worry.

1326
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:55,960
Chewing tobacco.

1327
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,199
Cool.

1328
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:00,199
Pressuring fans.

1329
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,460
No, you guys know that.

1330
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,739
It's not I don't care.

1331
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:10,479
Oh, there's an upper left.

1332
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, there's a fortnight chest up here.

1333
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,760
What's in here?

1334
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,640
Epic.

1335
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,439
Is it an epic?

1336
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:19,630
Holy shit.

1337
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:27,630
Somebody's hey, the great Lord Walden just gave out 20 tier one community subs.

1338
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:28,510
Thank you.

1339
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:30,039
Thank you so much, dude.

1340
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,989
Okay, 20, 20 subs here from Walden.

1341
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:37,470
Thanks, man.

1342
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:42,810
Oh, my Lord.

1343
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,729
No, no, that's not this is not what.

1344
01:25:44,729 --> 01:25:46,409
Thank you for the 10 subs after it.

1345
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:48,760
Thank you.

1346
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,630
Oh, here it comes.

1347
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:01,720
I just can't keep my mouth shut.

1348
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,479
But thank you guys.

1349
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,159
Unnecessary.

1350
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:06,039
But thank you.

1351
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,300
All right.

1352
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,180
I gotta search up here.

1353
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:14,409
There's still things that I need to get.

1354
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:18,029
Okay, that hurt.

1355
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:19,770
What else is in here?

1356
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:24,270
Sub.

1357
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,310
Oh, there's a chest.

1358
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,829
I told you there's a fortnight chest in here.

1359
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,000
Take.

1360
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:33,520
Take.

1361
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,079
Is it a knife?

1362
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:36,880
Two dollars and 12 cents.

1363
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,430
And cigarettes.

1364
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:45,180
Whoa.

1365
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:50,039
What is it?

1366
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,000
Is this dynamite?

1367
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,159
What?

1368
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,359
How would I even climb this?

1369
01:26:58,939 --> 01:26:59,899
This looks good.

1370
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,199
What do you think, Bill?

1371
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:03,159
Well, looks fine.

1372
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:05,390
But thank you, though.

1373
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,430
Those guys giving out those subs.

1374
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:08,199
Really appreciate it.

1375
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,270
Did we get everything?

1376
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,069
Think so, boss.

1377
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,149
Found this on one of them.

1378
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:15,550
Thank you.

1379
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,390
This is perfect.

1380
01:27:18,189 --> 01:27:19,229
Oh, yeah.

1381
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:19,869
Interesting.

1382
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:23,069
This is something about the train they was gonna rob.

1383
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:23,630
Train mission.

1384
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,109
I bought it.

1385
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:25,149
It was 20 dollars.

1386
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:26,750
Mr. Leviticus Cornwall.

1387
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:28,670
Mount back up.

1388
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,630
Let's keep moving.

1389
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,239
What does dynamite smell like?

1390
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,039
Alright, let's get out of here.

1391
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:36,159
Proud of you, boys.

1392
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,779
All of you.

1393
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:39,260
Raisins.

1394
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,770
No, that's tobacco.

1395
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,970
Gunpowder smells like...

1396
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:46,140
Not bad for some starving down in...

1397
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:46,460
Uh.

1398
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,819
They can pummel us.

1399
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:49,239
Hard as they like.

1400
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:50,439
It's hard to describe.

1401
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,569
If you drop the frame, it's gonna happen.

1402
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:10,170
I can't even get angry about it anymore.

1403
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:17,689
You know, there's no sense crying over spilt milk.

1404
01:28:17,689 --> 01:28:18,810
Sorry, spilt.

1405
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,170
It's just gonna happen.

1406
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:23,050
Just, thankfully, it's not happening as frequently as it was at the beginning of the train.

1407
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:27,500
You know, he'll come after us.

1408
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,739
What do I think of the game so far?

1409
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:29,979
Um.

1410
01:28:29,979 --> 01:28:31,579
Just like all the rest.

1411
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:33,899
But we're gonna stay a step ahead of them.

1412
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:36,439
Make sure we always know where they are.

1413
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:37,640
It's very atmospheric.

1414
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,840
Seems like it's gonna be really fun.

1415
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,359
We allowed ourselves to get a step behind at Blackwater.

1416
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,039
That won't happen again.

1417
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,600
Even just that up there.

1418
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:50,460
Looks great.

1419
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:54,329
And we're just still in the tutorial, yeah.

1420
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,329
There's way more going on.

1421
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:57,529
Hang in, fellas.

1422
01:28:57,529 --> 01:28:58,810
Let's make some ground.

1423
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,119
Cowboy Skyrim.

1424
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,340
Yeah.

1425
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:09,079
That's not a bad thing, though.

1426
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,300
It really makes you feel like Spider-Man.

1427
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:14,800
That's right.

1428
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:27,529
Bring him back alive.

1429
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:30,960
We got it.

1430
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,810
Chase down and lasso old Driscoll.

1431
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:39,979
So do I get the la-

1432
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:41,180
Hold and get the weapon wheel.

1433
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,500
This is gonna bring up is the lasso.

1434
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:45,770
Okay.

1435
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:48,170
Hold L2 to ready lasso and aim it at old Driscoll.

1436
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:54,039
One of the most fun mechanics of the last game here it is.

1437
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,670
Keep L2 held and dismount.

1438
01:30:17,289 --> 01:30:17,789
Press it.

1439
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:31,369
Let's interrogate him in the water.

1440
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:34,079
Let's drown this motherfucker.

1441
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,819
He got out.

1442
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:51,920
Where did he go?

1443
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,680
Oh, he's uh, he actually is like getting drowned.

1444
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:09,039
Give him a stone.

1445
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,399
Yep, drop him on the back of the horse.

1446
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:18,270
He might actually be able to drown.

1447
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:20,579
Maybe.

1448
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:23,779
Okay.

1449
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:28,010
Yellow line in the radar is the shortest route.

1450
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,050
In the yellow truck.

1451
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,479
Press the thumb stick to pet the horse.

1452
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:48,680
Yeah, I got him.

1453
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,180
I pet him.

1454
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,199
I gave him a little-

1455
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:53,319
Hey, you're doing a great job.

1456
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:58,850
Thank you.

1457
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,939
Shut up.

1458
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:20,489
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1459
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:20,890
Where is it?

1460
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:21,390
Come on.

1461
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:22,510
Come on.

1462
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:23,869
Come on.

1463
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:32,489
Trying to shoot the bird.

1464
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,680
Can you throw dynamite at birds in this game?

1465
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,960
Does it follow them like in the last one?

1466
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:45,550
What bird?

1467
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:46,430
The bird that was on the right.

1468
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:52,909
Yes, that does-

1469
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:54,189
That is still in the game.

1470
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:04,960
You can try.

1471
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,239
I mean, we'll eventually we'll try.

1472
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:24,920
Seeing birds from other dimensions now.

1473
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:39,880
204 bones to go.

1474
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:47,680
Bring him to the fire and drop him in.

1475
01:33:48,939 --> 01:33:49,979
We're eating good tonight.

1476
01:33:57,119 --> 01:33:58,479
Hold near your horse to remove him.

1477
01:34:09,069 --> 01:34:09,470
I would.

1478
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:10,590
No, I can't right now.

1479
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,470
We can't do that.

1480
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,569
I'm not doing that whole thing again.

1481
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,699
I thought I was going to start cutting him.

1482
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,560
Uncle.

1483
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:31,880
Mr.

1484
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,439
Williamson.

1485
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:35,479
Tie this maggot up someplace safe.

1486
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,479
We get him hungry first.

1487
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:39,159
I got a saying, my friend.

1488
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:42,079
We shoot fellas.

1489
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:42,960
There's no need shooting.

1490
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,720
Save fellas.

1491
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,600
There's no need saving.

1492
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:47,359
And feed them.

1493
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:48,319
There's no need feeding.

1494
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,560
We are going to find out what you need.

1495
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,050
I can't believe it.

1496
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,010
An O'Driscoll in my camp.

1497
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,369
I ain't an O'Driscoll, mister.

1498
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:00,729
I ain't-

1499
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,479
Oh, whatever you say, son.

1500
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:05,640
Well done, Arthur.

1501
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,819
I'm just sorry we missed out on call.

1502
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:08,619
Why am I still holding them?

1503
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:09,739
Well, there's time enough for that.

1504
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:13,739
Now, I gotta figure out if we can hit that train.

1505
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:15,100
Okay.

1506
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:28,170
That's a long saying.

1507
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,960
Old friends complete.

1508
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,369
Now we got P on the map.

1509
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,649
Oh, excuse me.

1510
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,329
I probably got an F.

1511
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:48,350
Complete the mission without taking any health items.

1512
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,159
One, two, three, four, five.

1513
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,760
I got a 25% on the test.

1514
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:06,010
Now, let's keep going through the tutorial.

1515
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:10,109
No, I don't-

1516
01:36:10,109 --> 01:36:11,149
I don't even need to get on the horse.

1517
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,189
He's literally right here.

1518
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,180
Stu, I'll take you.

1519
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,859
I'm gonna starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.

1520
01:36:29,979 --> 01:36:30,779
We're okay.

1521
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,680
We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.

1522
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,399
For what?

1523
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:37,439
Ten, twelve people?

1524
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:40,350
That was in the Navy.

1525
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:44,029
I do not wish to hear about what you got up to in the Navy, Mr. Pearson.

1526
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:46,670
We were stranded at sea.

1527
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,909
For 50 days.

1528
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,989
And you unfortunately survived.

1529
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:56,890
When we ran away from Blackwater, I wasn't able to get supplies in.

1530
01:36:57,850 --> 01:36:58,729
Idiot streamer.

1531
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,569
Idiot streamer.

1532
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:03,449
Sometimes shopping trips need to be cut short.

1533
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,970
We'll survive.

1534
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:06,649
We always have.

1535
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:09,689
If needs be, we can eat you.

1536
01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:10,569
You're the fattest.

1537
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:13,850
I sent Lenny and Bill hunting and they found-

1538
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:14,649
Ew, gross.

1539
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:16,010
I mean, fucking disgusting.

1540
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,579
Bill's a fool.

1541
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:22,060
Unless those mountains are full of game they want to read,

1542
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,979
ain't no wonder they found enough of this.

1543
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:26,159
We'll go find something.

1544
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:26,880
Come on, Arthur.

1545
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,079
Wait a second.

1546
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:29,579
Hold on.

1547
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:31,979
Here.

1548
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,239
You're gonna need something to eat out there.

1549
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:36,640
The sordid salted off.

1550
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:40,279
Starving will be preferable.

1551
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:41,399
Come on, let's go.

1552
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:45,960
Is it weird that these gross shit items that are in these games,

1553
01:37:46,439 --> 01:37:52,279
the rotten can of beans and packed in spam that's four years expired,

1554
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:53,079
I want to eat them.

1555
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:55,880
If I could pull that out of history and eat it,

1556
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,920
I would probably do it right now.

1557
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,079
Nobody else does that?

1558
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:08,359
I can't use it and you'll have to.

1559
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:10,619
Bow and arrow.

1560
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:13,899
Use a gun and we'll scare off every animal for miles around.

1561
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,220
You're never too old to learn.

1562
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:17,739
I imagine.

1563
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:18,939
You okay?

1564
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:21,640
Yeah, yeah, man.

1565
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,199
Let's head out.

1566
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,810
Yeah.

1567
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:34,319
Match the speed of your cockspill.

1568
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,840
Stupid mistake.

1569
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,199
It'll be fine in a day or two.

1570
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,279
I just can't pull a bow right now.

1571
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,460
Is that guy on YouTube that eats the old military rations?

1572
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,899
Yeah, that channel's great.

1573
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:59,069
I've put on that guy's channel and just fallen asleep to him eating old rations

1574
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:01,630
and woken up at like 60 videos a player.

1575
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:02,750
They'll be needing to feed.

1576
01:39:04,029 --> 01:39:08,800
I'm going to tap square when we're stationed from this move.

1577
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,960
Oh, you can like hold it.

1578
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,359
That's cool.

1579
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,680
Is that just showing off?

1580
01:39:26,989 --> 01:39:27,789
I didn't wait.

1581
01:39:27,789 --> 01:39:28,670
I'm not saying what?

1582
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:29,470
I didn't say that.

1583
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:30,770
No.

1584
01:39:38,359 --> 01:39:39,640
I've done that to your videos.

1585
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,140
Yeah.

1586
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,340
Just happened.

1587
01:39:55,630 --> 01:39:56,989
Let's put this out on a tray.

1588
01:39:57,789 --> 01:39:58,989
Yeah, I know the line.

1589
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:00,029
Come on.

1590
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:01,229
You don't think I've ever seen it before?

1591
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,659
Automatic cinematic.

1592
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:34,010
Coffee instant cheetos.

1593
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,810
Oh, God.

1594
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:50,220
I wonder how big the actual map is when the game opens up.

1595
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:53,340
It all is bad, but if it's too strong, they won't move.

1596
01:40:53,340 --> 01:41:01,340
Stay quiet.

1597
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,380
Do a German impression?

1598
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:03,439
Okay.

1599
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:06,520
Stop here a second.

1600
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:07,960
I see something.

1601
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,960
I was about to just wildly make fun of myself.

1602
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,319
Like just make fun of me.

1603
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:15,399
No, I'm not doing that.

1604
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,079
Why would I do?

1605
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:19,579
No.

1606
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:23,720
I've already done this before.

1607
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,359
Recently.

1608
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:26,199
How can you do?

1609
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,600
I've already done it.

1610
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:33,579
We'll track them on foot.

1611
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:34,909
You're gonna need the book.

1612
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:36,909
Don't leave it on your whole gun.

1613
01:41:36,909 --> 01:41:38,430
It'll scare everything around.

1614
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,949
Approach your horse.

1615
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:40,750
Don't use the gun.

1616
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:51,020
So with Z, use L2R to select a stowed weapon.

1617
01:41:51,979 --> 01:41:52,699
Carbine.

1618
01:41:52,699 --> 01:41:53,100
Bow.

1619
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:53,739
That's the one.

1620
01:41:54,939 --> 01:41:58,840
No point setting off without that bow.

1621
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,359
You make less noise when you crouch.

1622
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:01,079
And slowly.

1623
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,460
I'm not gonna do it.

1624
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:05,579
I'm not gonna shoot him in the head.

1625
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:10,670
You see the tracks?

1626
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:12,189
I think so.

1627
01:42:12,989 --> 01:42:14,270
Maybe not.

1628
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,909
I see them.

1629
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:18,600
You can use eagle eye to highlight animal tracks.

1630
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:21,630
Okay.

1631
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,600
Focus on the track.

1632
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:32,119
Enable eagle eye focus on the tracks to highlight them again.

1633
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,750
Okay.

1634
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,229
Yeah, I can.

1635
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:35,710
I see it.

1636
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,039
Your scent is also shown in eagle eye blowing in the direction of the wind.

1637
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:47,640
Animals will flee if they smell your scent.

1638
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,880
They'll remain downwind or far away when hunting.

1639
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:59,180
So is this...

1640
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,460
Is that my smell going this way?

1641
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:01,899
Or are those those of his tracks, right?

1642
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:09,130
He's gonna be up here.

1643
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:21,479
It's top track.

1644
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:22,520
I mean, I'm just gonna follow it.

1645
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,159
22 miles per hour.

1646
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:26,960
Top right.

1647
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,159
Which way is it going though?

1648
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:31,760
This way.

1649
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,250
Unknown animal.

1650
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:40,970
It's gonna be a deer.

1651
01:43:43,659 --> 01:43:44,939
22 miles per hour.

1652
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:46,060
That would be very...

1653
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:46,859
That'd be a lot.

1654
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:49,420
I don't see anything.

1655
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,060
Oh, there it is.

1656
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:50,560
Okay.

1657
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:55,899
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1658
01:43:55,899 --> 01:43:56,779
Am I close enough?

1659
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:03,149
I'm gonna have to do like a...

1660
01:44:03,149 --> 01:44:04,029
Is it bullet drop?

1661
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:14,829
Aim for the head.

1662
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,100
A swing.

1663
01:44:17,979 --> 01:44:26,000
Do I not go get the meat?

1664
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,510
Hunt another deer.

1665
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:31,010
Okay.

1666
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:32,649
Well, I'm gonna...

1667
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:33,770
I wanna get the meat here.

1668
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:36,890
Select and call while aiming at it.

1669
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:39,050
This will give you a chance of a clean kill

1670
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:40,890
as they raise their head before fleeing.

1671
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:45,579
So there's one over here.

1672
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,060
All right.

1673
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,140
Do I even need to lock that one?

1674
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:59,500
I mean, we get the 21 stink meter up there.

1675
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:04,829
Okay.

1676
01:45:04,829 --> 01:45:06,829
I haven't even played God of War,

1677
01:45:06,829 --> 01:45:07,869
the new one for PS4.

1678
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:09,630
But I feel like this is the game...

1679
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,029
Is that...

1680
01:45:10,029 --> 01:45:11,229
This happens in that game, right?

1681
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,720
This is like the same game.

1682
01:45:20,909 --> 01:45:21,789
Something like that.

1683
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:22,750
Yeah. Which way is it going?

1684
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:33,869
I mean, is this...

1685
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:35,390
Is it going that way?

1686
01:45:36,189 --> 01:45:37,229
Or to the left?

1687
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:40,279
That I don't know.

1688
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:46,090
The tracks.

1689
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,210
I mean, those are tracks, right?

1690
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:49,069
Or did I make those?

1691
01:45:49,069 --> 01:45:49,869
No, it's down here.

1692
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:58,859
What's the button to call?

1693
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:07,289
Fuck!

1694
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:15,260
I don't even need to call them.

1695
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,380
Why did I even call?

1696
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,579
That was no reason for that.

1697
01:46:21,869 --> 01:46:23,310
I made these tracks.

1698
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,430
Okay. There he is.

1699
01:46:42,199 --> 01:46:43,979
Got it.

1700
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:45,020
Okay. We can stop this now.

1701
01:46:45,579 --> 01:46:46,079
Let's go!

1702
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:57,130
Oh, it's actually...

1703
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:58,170
Pick up the whole thing?

1704
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:01,119
This is realism.

1705
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:06,989
The compendium tracks what you have discovered in the world.

1706
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:09,949
It can be accessed from the progress section of the pause menu.

1707
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:15,579
We've found the realism.

1708
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:21,239
And you can increase the distance that the horse will respond.

1709
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:24,359
Come on!

1710
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:29,579
There he is.

1711
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:33,050
Shoot the deer in the head.

1712
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:33,850
No!

1713
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:35,770
I don't want to explode the deer's head.

1714
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:52,189
All right. Let's go.

1715
01:47:53,289 --> 01:47:54,010
Yes, you do.

1716
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:54,649
No, I don't.

1717
01:47:55,289 --> 01:47:56,729
I don't want to do it.

1718
01:47:56,729 --> 01:48:04,880
All right. Meet up with Charles.

1719
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,239
All right, Charlie.

1720
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:08,960
I'm coming.

1721
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:21,210
I want to see its brains.

1722
01:48:21,210 --> 01:48:22,409
Jesus Christ!

1723
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,340
So you drop off carcasses to Pearson

1724
01:48:34,699 --> 01:48:37,979
at the meat factory to contribute to gang supplies.

1725
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:38,479
Okay.

1726
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,340
Okay. You want to see the deer's balls?

1727
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,460
Everyone's freaking out about it.

1728
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,739
All right. Let's look at the deer's balls.

1729
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:47,819
The deer doesn't have any balls.

1730
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,000
Right.

1731
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:50,720
Okay.

1732
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:53,149
That's not how it works.

1733
01:48:53,949 --> 01:48:54,510
Seems to me.

1734
01:49:01,399 --> 01:49:02,119
You know, there are...

1735
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,359
See? I told you they weren't going to be there.

1736
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,710
I missed you guys.

1737
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,350
I really did.

1738
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,600
I unequivocally missed all of you.

1739
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,829
We give the camp cook five minutes to grab the essentials and go.

1740
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:42,750
And he doesn't even bring a crumb of food.

1741
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,109
Good that we caught more than one.

1742
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:46,350
We've only been up here a few days

1743
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:48,430
and have already picked up two more mouths to feed.

1744
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:50,430
One more.

1745
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:52,350
I bet German doesn't even know me.

1746
01:49:53,949 --> 01:49:54,449
Boy!

1747
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,050
What's your name?

1748
01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:07,210
Even me?

1749
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:08,569
The one that makes fun of you?

1750
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:09,069
Even you.

1751
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,430
Even you.

1752
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,239
No, I'm not going to show the horse balls.

1753
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:29,279
That's too easy.

1754
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,039
I'm not going to shoot the horse's balls with an arrow like everybody wants me to do.

1755
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,039
That's not going to happen.

1756
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:51,039
No one said that?

1757
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:51,680
Yes, they did.

1758
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,319
Oh, shit.

1759
01:50:58,319 --> 01:50:58,819
Bears.

1760
01:51:07,149 --> 01:51:07,869
No, don't shoot him.

1761
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:10,989
Am I losing...

1762
01:51:10,989 --> 01:51:12,109
What's wrong with my arms?

1763
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:12,670
No, let it go.

1764
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:12,989
Let go.

1765
01:51:12,989 --> 01:51:13,310
Let go.

1766
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:13,630
Let go.

1767
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:14,029
There you go.

1768
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:27,210
You're going awfully fast.

1769
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:34,159
Oh, the horse is...

1770
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,520
The horse is spooked.

1771
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,020
Okay.

1772
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,079
I'm going to hold L3 to make the horse not...

1773
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,890
Can he see us?

1774
01:51:45,239 --> 01:51:46,039
Fight bear.

1775
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:46,600
Fight bear.

1776
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:54,159
Right in the fucking head.

1777
01:51:55,119 --> 01:52:01,869
All right, let's get out of here.

1778
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:06,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1779
01:52:10,649 --> 01:52:11,369
All right.

1780
01:52:11,369 --> 01:52:12,250
Cinematic mode.

1781
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,840
He's screaming.

1782
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,439
Where's my friend?

1783
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:21,659
Come on.

1784
01:52:21,659 --> 01:52:21,979
Let's go.

1785
01:52:21,979 --> 01:52:22,380
Let's go.

1786
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:23,340
Why is he standing there?

1787
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:27,609
Is there a reason why he's just standing still up here?

1788
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:35,930
The bear is gone.

1789
01:52:36,489 --> 01:52:37,479
Yeah, we're good.

1790
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:43,449
I'm in combat.

1791
01:52:43,449 --> 01:52:44,170
No, I am not.

1792
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:54,640
Let's go.

1793
01:53:00,029 --> 01:53:01,390
I have to fight the bear now.

1794
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:15,960
Okay, I need to turn it off for a second.

1795
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,439
Hold on.

1796
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:17,000
Okay.

1797
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,960
Okay, okay, okay.

1798
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,680
Where's the bear?

1799
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,270
Where's the bear?

1800
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:29,149
I don't see a bear.

1801
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:34,460
Give me the fucking carbine.

1802
01:53:44,619 --> 01:53:45,340
There's no bear.

1803
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:47,159
He's not here.

1804
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:52,760
Do you guys understand?

1805
01:53:57,369 --> 01:53:58,250
Do you see a bear?

1806
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,760
I don't see a bear.

1807
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,100
Wait, tracks.

1808
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,649
Right there.

1809
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:26,279
Where the fuck is he?

1810
01:54:36,029 --> 01:54:36,510
He's not here.

1811
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:46,029
I see him.

1812
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:48,880
No, you don't.

1813
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,560
I mean, the red marker is over here.

1814
01:54:54,279 --> 01:54:55,640
Wouldn't he be over at the red marker?

1815
01:54:56,359 --> 01:54:59,880
I'm out of stamina.

1816
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,359
I gotta eat.

1817
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:01,159
Hold on.

1818
01:55:01,159 --> 01:55:03,520
Why did you guys make me do this?

1819
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:06,300
I was so close to the end here.

1820
01:55:10,649 --> 01:55:11,850
Eat a can of beans.

1821
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:20,779
Give me my horse.

1822
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:24,810
You made you do this.

1823
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:25,529
You did this.

1824
01:55:26,649 --> 01:55:29,819
There was never any bear?

1825
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:33,800
Why do I hear it now?

1826
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:40,539
Can we just leave?

1827
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,220
We can leave.

1828
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:42,619
Can't we?

1829
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,899
He said, return to Charles.

1830
01:55:45,899 --> 01:55:46,460
He said, go.

1831
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,340
Hurry up and return.

1832
01:55:47,979 --> 01:55:48,859
Where's my carcass?

1833
01:55:49,819 --> 01:55:53,050
Fucking carcass is on the ground over here.

1834
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:53,930
That's what's happening.

1835
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:54,329
I get it.

1836
01:55:57,789 --> 01:56:09,130
The horse is just as fucking stupid as I am.

1837
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:12,539
All right.

1838
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:13,899
This is why I couldn't move.

1839
01:56:13,899 --> 01:56:15,420
It has nothing to do with the bear.

1840
01:56:20,859 --> 01:56:21,180
See?

1841
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:22,859
Everyone told me it's because I was in combat.

1842
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:24,539
This isn't World of Warcraft.

1843
01:56:25,579 --> 01:56:26,380
We can just leave.

1844
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:32,859
All right.

1845
01:56:32,859 --> 01:56:33,260
Let's go.

1846
01:56:39,149 --> 01:56:39,630
Fuck.

1847
01:56:39,630 --> 01:57:00,220
Who is this fucking bear?

1848
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:09,960
I soft-locked the game?

1849
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,680
No, I didn't.

1850
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,560
Yeah.

1851
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:38,829
We're fine.

1852
01:57:38,829 --> 01:57:40,189
Were you awake back there?

1853
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:40,989
Yeah.

1854
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:42,590
Just thinking.

1855
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:46,350
We ain't ever talked that much, you mate.

1856
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,710
Shoot bear with arrow.

1857
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:50,430
And my toddler brain was like,

1858
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:51,470
shoot bear with arrow.

1859
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:52,350
OK.

1860
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:53,470
I do think you say.

1861
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:54,270
You think this?

1862
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:54,909
What?

1863
01:57:54,909 --> 01:57:55,869
I'm a caveman.

1864
01:57:56,989 --> 01:57:59,449
Jerma, do that thing.

1865
01:57:59,449 --> 01:58:00,090
I do think.

1866
01:58:00,729 --> 01:58:03,529
Me shoot arrow to bow to bear head.

1867
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,430
Me shoot bear.

1868
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:17,289
Chat say good idea.

1869
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:29,630
Me show balls.

1870
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,399
Me laugh.

1871
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:40,960
Me laugh at lowbrow joke.

1872
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,199
Me stream on Twitch with bad internet.

1873
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:20,189
Me try explain TCP IP to Bogo.

1874
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,920
Bogo throw rock at head.

1875
01:59:32,909 --> 01:59:43,470
It's pretty nice and movie.

1876
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,060
Well, it looks good.

1877
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:02,140
But I'm streaming at 6,000 right now.

1878
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:07,149
I mean, when it's good, it looks great.

1879
02:00:07,949 --> 02:00:08,430
Right?

1880
02:00:08,989 --> 02:00:10,109
When it's bad, yeah.

1881
02:00:14,619 --> 02:00:25,600
Who the hell is calling me right now?

1882
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,119
But I cannot answer that.

1883
02:00:54,199 --> 02:00:55,319
So this upgrades.

1884
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,119
Did they go a Fallout 4 route here?

1885
02:00:59,079 --> 02:01:01,319
Do I have to bring supplies and build stuff?

1886
02:01:17,739 --> 02:01:18,460
It's not forced?

1887
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:18,859
That's good.

1888
02:01:28,619 --> 02:01:29,340
You earned it.

1889
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:31,020
Have a drink.

1890
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,739
It's urine.

1891
02:01:31,739 --> 02:01:33,420
Jesus, what is that?

1892
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,699
Navy rum, sir.

1893
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:35,739
It's the only thing.

1894
02:01:35,739 --> 02:01:36,460
The only thing.

1895
02:01:37,819 --> 02:01:38,619
Keeps you sane.

1896
02:01:38,619 --> 02:01:39,020
It does.

1897
02:01:39,739 --> 02:01:41,739
Seems to have done a treat on you.

1898
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:43,420
You go rest that hand, Charles.

1899
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:44,779
I'll be fine in a few days.

1900
02:01:44,779 --> 02:01:47,340
You mind helping me with the skinning, Mr. Morgan?

1901
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,619
It's easier if we do it together.

1902
02:01:48,619 --> 02:01:49,659
I'll get to skin you.

1903
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:53,079
You're always one with the jokes, aren't you?

1904
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:53,640
Come on.

1905
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,199
This really isn't a job for a man with a burnt hand.

1906
02:01:56,199 --> 02:01:57,720
I'll see you both later.

1907
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:04,199
See, that guy has the quintessential haircut of end of the plate of spaghetti.

1908
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:06,920
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, you can take this.

1909
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,560
I'm done.

1910
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:08,520
Are you sure you're done with that?

1911
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:09,000
Yep, yep.

1912
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:17,550
Arthur, come on, get that knife.

1913
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:22,109
Just get him.

1914
02:02:22,109 --> 02:02:23,149
Now shoot the deer.

1915
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:25,310
No, I'm not going to fuck up the tutorial missions.

1916
02:02:25,869 --> 02:02:27,390
That was very quick.

1917
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,039
That's what it looks like in there?

1918
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:31,720
Not too bad, Mr. Morgan.

1919
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,840
I thought it was wires and...

1920
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:35,630
Yeah, we said you were a butcher.

1921
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:37,869
Components and shit.

1922
02:02:37,869 --> 02:02:38,750
Looks like that in there.

1923
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:46,189
I thought we just made animals.

1924
02:02:46,189 --> 02:02:47,149
They're like computers.

1925
02:02:47,149 --> 02:02:50,909
Well, if you catch anything else, sir, you bring it to me.

1926
02:02:50,909 --> 02:02:51,409
Sure.

1927
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:53,789
Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

1928
02:02:53,789 --> 02:02:58,750
Heck, Arthur Morgan's first decent bit of hunting after all these years.

1929
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,710
Yeah.

1930
02:02:59,710 --> 02:03:01,470
Well, we're on the run now.

1931
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:03,630
Everyone's got to do their bit to survive.

1932
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:04,750
You're not a Chuck E. Cheese.

1933
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:06,189
The folk need it.

1934
02:03:07,069 --> 02:03:08,430
It's been a tough few days.

1935
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:21,579
A few days later, you unlocked the Master Hunter Challenge.

1936
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,119
All right, tutorial complete.

1937
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:31,260
It's been a bad few weeks, but Dutch, being Dutch, he is busy making plans and

1938
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:36,539
Dutch, being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.

1939
02:03:39,229 --> 02:03:39,869
Not yet, huh?

1940
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:42,909
Who the hell is Epiticus?

1941
02:03:42,909 --> 02:03:45,149
I thought you was reading him his last rites.

1942
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:49,069
Now I see you're introducing him to your other passion.

1943
02:03:49,069 --> 02:03:52,270
I'll mind you to show me some respect, Mr. Morgan.

1944
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:53,630
Mind away, Reverend.

1945
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:55,710
You're still here, then?

1946
02:03:56,909 --> 02:03:57,840
I owe you.

1947
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,380
And you'll pay me.

1948
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:02,909
For the moment, just rest.

1949
02:04:04,409 --> 02:04:07,579
Arthur, I think it's time for the train.

1950
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:09,100
Want me to come?

1951
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:12,060
Of course I do, but look out.

1952
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:12,380
You stay.

1953
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:14,060
That was always ugly, Dutch.

1954
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,180
It's just a scratch.

1955
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,619
Don't lie still, son.

1956
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:18,060
What's that kid doing?

1957
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,020
Get that kid out of here.

1958
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,100
This is an M-rated game.

1959
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,140
He's not allowed in here.

1960
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,380
He's seen me now.

1961
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:26,640
What's left of me?

1962
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:29,149
What about you?

1963
02:04:29,149 --> 02:04:30,750
Guess I was hoping to see a corpse.

1964
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:32,670
Bide your time.

1965
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,949
You'll see plenty of them.

1966
02:04:33,949 --> 02:04:35,550
You're a rotten man, John Marston.

1967
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:37,310
He is an idiot, Abigail.

1968
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,189
We all know it.

1969
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:39,069
Fix the D-sync.

1970
02:04:39,069 --> 02:04:41,470
Now, railway man.

1971
02:04:41,470 --> 02:04:42,029
Bill!

1972
02:04:43,149 --> 02:04:44,109
Tell me what happens here.

1973
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:44,350
Ready?

1974
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:46,670
At the water tower, just before the tunnel.

1975
02:04:46,670 --> 02:04:47,630
Ain't a problem.

1976
02:04:47,789 --> 02:04:49,390
Why are we doing this?

1977
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,189
Weather's breaking.

1978
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:50,750
We could leave.

1979
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:52,430
I thought we was lying low.

1980
02:04:53,710 --> 02:04:55,390
What do you want from me, Jose?

1981
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,789
I just don't want any more folks to die, Dutch.

1982
02:04:57,789 --> 02:04:58,909
We're living, Jose.

1983
02:04:58,909 --> 02:04:59,550
We're living.

1984
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:00,510
Look at me.

1985
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:01,229
We're living.

1986
02:05:01,229 --> 02:05:02,430
Even you.

1987
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,109
But we need money.

1988
02:05:04,109 --> 02:05:06,029
Everything we have is in Blackwater.

1989
02:05:06,029 --> 02:05:06,430
Of course.

1990
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:07,949
You fancy heading back there?

1991
02:05:07,949 --> 02:05:08,189
No.

1992
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:11,739
Listen, Dutch, I ain't trying to undermine you.

1993
02:05:11,739 --> 02:05:16,939
I just want to stick to the plan, which was to lie low, then head back out west.

1994
02:05:17,579 --> 02:05:20,140
Now, suddenly, we're about to rob a train.

1995
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:20,859
Now it's too fast.

1996
02:05:20,859 --> 02:05:22,220
What choice have we got?

1997
02:05:22,859 --> 02:05:24,140
The Viticus Cornwalls.

1998
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,340
No joke, Dutchie.

1999
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,340
Who is the Viticus Cornwall?

2000
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:27,819
That fix it?

2001
02:05:27,819 --> 02:05:31,579
He's a big railway magnet, sugar dealer, oil man.

2002
02:05:31,579 --> 02:05:33,100
Well, how good for him.

2003
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,739
Sounds like he has more than enough to share.

2004
02:05:35,739 --> 02:05:36,300
Dutch.

2005
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:41,500
Gentlemen, it is time to make something of ourselves.

2006
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,500
Get your horses ready.

2007
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,859
We have a train to rob.

2008
02:05:44,859 --> 02:05:45,359
Better?

2009
02:05:59,869 --> 02:06:00,430
Bad.

2010
02:06:00,430 --> 02:06:00,930
Bad.

2011
02:06:07,239 --> 02:06:08,199
Everything's weird?

2012
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,560
No, it's not.

2013
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:16,670
We're riding with the gang.

2014
02:06:17,229 --> 02:06:17,789
All right.

2015
02:06:17,789 --> 02:06:18,590
Riding with the gang.

2016
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:26,909
The street smells like pee now.

2017
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:36,090
I'm gonna get hit by a train, I guarantee it.

2018
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:40,680
Why is the audio playing backwards?

2019
02:06:41,399 --> 02:06:41,880
You know what?

2020
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:43,399
You know what?

2021
02:06:44,199 --> 02:06:46,189
Don't you be coming back here now.

2022
02:06:46,829 --> 02:06:52,079
I don't know why that just popped in my head.

2023
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:54,479
That's when you go to jail in the Monopoly game for Super Nintendo.

2024
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:57,600
I don't know.

2025
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,319
That just popped in.

2026
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,000
It just popped in saying hello.

2027
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,319
I don't know why.

2028
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,739
It just popped in.

2029
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:10,539
You know, it just popped in.

2030
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:15,720
Game or reference.

2031
02:07:18,039 --> 02:07:19,079
I wasn't paying attention.

2032
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,340
God damn it.

2033
02:07:23,979 --> 02:07:24,300
All right.

2034
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:25,020
Rob the train.

2035
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:25,819
That's all I need to know.

2036
02:07:26,539 --> 02:07:38,859
So what's the story about?

2037
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:39,659
Group of bandits.

2038
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:41,020
Setting up camp.

2039
02:07:41,739 --> 02:07:42,460
Getting deer.

2040
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:48,859
And fending off other bandits.

2041
02:07:49,579 --> 02:07:50,140
So far.

2042
02:07:50,859 --> 02:07:52,380
And John Marston.

2043
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:53,020
Oh, he did?

2044
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,579
He didn't die?

2045
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,229
What happened?

2046
02:07:55,229 --> 02:07:57,069
That's a close one.

2047
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:05,800
Well, this is pretty.

2048
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:11,369
No, did we go to like zero?

2049
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,439
What's that right over here?

2050
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:23,239
This is what I call a crew.

2051
02:08:23,239 --> 02:08:24,840
Charles Smith.

2052
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,359
Bartholomew Morgan.

2053
02:08:26,359 --> 02:08:27,960
Javier Escuela.

2054
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,949
First man.

2055
02:08:31,949 --> 02:08:35,149
I was under the assumption that I was hopefully going to be live for at least a couple of hours.

2056
02:08:35,149 --> 02:08:36,510
Let's hope it's stable.

2057
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,510
You sure you're ready for this, kid?

2058
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:39,390
Of course I'm ready.

2059
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:41,710
Just stay calm.

2060
02:08:41,710 --> 02:08:42,989
Keep your eyes sharp.

2061
02:08:42,989 --> 02:08:43,390
Holy shit.
