1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,349
We good? Alright, it's time for us to do the greatest video game of all time. Tear List.

2
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:17,710
This is gonna- oh my god, this is gonna take a while. And I'm too red! This is gonna take all

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:28,559
fucking- I- I just was looking for some stuff to do real quick. That better? That better. Alright,

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,759
let's uh, let's start with- okay, this is- so this is the best game that I've ever played, right?

5
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,380
He's played like five games on this list. More than that, at least eight. Or ten.

6
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:50,609
But what actually have I played? Alright, let me get the ones that I'm certain of. Alright, Team

7
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:59,679
Fortress 2 is- is- is a masterpiece. It goes up here. What else is on here that's an absolute

8
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:07,280
masterpiece? That I know for a fact is like up at absolute masterpiece level. It's Resident Evil 4?

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,430
Resident Evil 4 is up here pretty close. Not- I wouldn't say the whole way. I'm not done with this

10
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:23,500
yet. We're gonna- we're gonna go to great. Um, Battlefield 1. I don't- I don't think that's-

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know if that should be on here. Battlefield 1? On the greatest video games have ever made list.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,260
Okay, but if it's the gr- okay, if every single game on here could be the greatest game ever made,

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,459
they're not necessarily horrible games, are they? I'm gonna put it- I'm gonna keep it here. It's

14
00:01:52,459 --> 00:02:04,939
gonna go down. Okay, um, XCOM 2. I've had never played it. Oh shit, Smite's on here. Smite on here.

15
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,659
Alright, but here I'm gonna be fair. It's a Smite. I think- I think Smite's more fun than Battlefield

16
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:22,270
1. I am- I am certain of that. Which one is this? Is it Smash Brothers Brawl or Smash-

17
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:29,780
Smash Brothers in general? I think that's Brawl. Hold on, I just gotta get this situated.

18
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,460
I don't- War- I don't wanna say Warframe is horrible, but I don't think it's the best game

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:45,900
ever made. I don't want it to be horrible, though. Okay, alright, let me ask you this.

20
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:54,509
If I have less than, like, two to three hours in the game, should it be under have not tried the

21
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:01,620
game? Because if I have less than five hours in the game, they're going down here. I don't even

22
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,030
think it's hor- okay, I'm just gonna- I'm just gonna leave it here. No. I think it's better than

23
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,460
Battlefield 1. I think everything's better than Battlefield 1 for me. I don't think there's

24
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,740
anything on this list that's worse than Battlefield 1 for me. We'll find out. This is very early.

25
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,159
This is League of Legends. I- I don't- I don't play it. That's gonna be at the bottom. God of

26
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:35,340
War 2. I didn't- I never played it. Fallout New Vegas. It's- I know people are gonna- This is-

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,409
Right now, I am just making myself out to be the ultimate hated person. This is more- This is way

28
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:53,919
different than doing cereal box tier lists. If Fallout New Vegas is not on Masterpiece, I think

29
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,460
a lot of you are gonna be very adamant that I'm- You're gonna want to, like, be mad at me.

30
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:10,379
I don't- I'm scared to put that idea- This is- Okay, this- Should I do an on-stream one and an

31
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,919
off-stream one and then tweet out the comparison? Oh yeah, Fallout New Vegas is, uh, it's definitely

32
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:23,220
an A-plus tier on-stream, Andy. And then off-stream is, like, down here. No, I'm gonna- I'm gonna do

33
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,899
this real. This is for real. This is what I actually really believe. I'm not gonna have anybody

34
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:34,589
fucking tell me what I- I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna have you influence me at all. I think

35
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,990
Smite is more fun than Fallout New Vegas. I- It is. I'm sorry. Everyone's gonna be mad at that,

36
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,810
but, like, I've had more fun playing- I- I don't know. I just think it is. I like that video game.

37
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:54,720
But this- But is it though? What- Did I- Maybe. On-stream, off-stream. It's close- Hold on. I

38
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,560
gotta get more up here. Until Dawn should not be on this list. Why? Half-Life 2 is also not gonna

39
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:11,819
be as high as people want it to be. I don't consider Half-Life 2 to be, like, up at Masterpiece.

40
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:18,800
It's- It's great. It also made me very sick. I don't know why. The boat level in Half-Life 2,

41
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,110
when you're in the boat, I had to stop playing every- Oh, this is Half-Life 1. Okay. Well,

42
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:32,240
hold on. Hold on. That still belongs up here. Half-Life 1, you idiot. All right. Half-Life-

43
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:47,389
Is Half-Life 1 more fun than Smite? Careful. Careful. Uh, Castlevania? I don't- I- I don't-

44
00:05:47,470 --> 00:06:00,959
I didn't play the one for PlayStation. I'm sorry. Bioshock 1. Bioshock 1 was very good.

45
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,050
It's not better- It might be better than Half-Life. Oh my god. People are gonna hate me.

46
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,230
But it's kind of not fair though, because it's so- It's like years later.

47
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:27,149
You're gonna stop. Based. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All right. Well, I'm gonna hold

48
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:34,110
on. I can- Once I get it to where I want it, then I'll be all right. This is Crash Team Racing?

49
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,029
I don't know what that is, but I didn't play it. Uncharted all- I've never played an Uncharted

50
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,750
game. I don't even have one second in them. I can't even put them on here.

51
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,339
Mourninghawk's Pro Skater 2. That's not a masterpiece, but it's up here.

52
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,180
Wait. Hold on. Am I allowed to put this up here? Didn't I talk a ton of shit about this game when

53
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,949
I was playing? Wasn't I raging? Like, constantly being whiny and annoying when I played this with

54
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:06,560
Dreamcast? I did, right? Okay. Then I can't put it up here. I was- I just kept complaining. Over

55
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:18,620
and over again. Over and over and over again. It's down here. Uh, Call of Duty Mad World 5-3.

56
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:27,420
That is- is not very- it's not good. It's not a good game. It was a fu- it was fun, but it wasn't

57
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:41,860
good. Look, every Call of Duty game can be fun, but it doesn't mean they're good. Like, it's fun- I

58
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,250
could just sit there and just, like, be on the phone with somebody. Just like, yeah, yeah, man,

59
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:58,779
yeah. Just playing a little bit of Kill Confirmed. Yeah, what are you up to? Yeah. No, I'll be over

60
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,899
in like fucking 20 minutes. Like, you just don't even fucking care. You just like the sound.

61
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,220
Actually, and it's something I really actually truly believe, I believe that the Call of Duty

62
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,500
hit sound is the only reason why people play the game. I truly believe that. That sound effect is

63
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,860
what brings everybody in. Something about it. It's- it's like this- it's this perfect, like,

64
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,220
scratching that itch on your back that's right in the middle that sits between your shoulder blades

65
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,899
and the middle of your back that you just can't barely get. But the second you get your middle

66
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:42,659
finger up there and you- without that hit sound, that game is a three. With that hit sound, it's

67
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:59,019
about a seven- it's a 6.5. Dark Souls- is Dark Souls one? Is Dark Souls one better than Smite?

68
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes. Of course it is. That would be outrageous if I thought otherwise. I'm not done with it yet.

69
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,259
It's- I don't- hold on. Let me- it's not- don't say Masterpiece yet. I'm only putting things in

70
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,870
Masterpiece that I truly can say belong there. Like, right off the bat without even thinking.

71
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:28,899
Some of these will move up. Just wait. I have not played A Hat in Time. Red Dem Redemption 2 was

72
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:50,860
very good. Was it more fun than Smite? Yes. Mass Effect 2? I didn't- is it- okay. I don't like

73
00:09:50,860 --> 00:10:02,049
those games. Is that- can I say that? Is it okay to say? I like- I like- don't like Mass Effect.

74
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:09,759
That's okay, right? I don't hate Mass Effect. I don't think it's a shitty game. I just don't like

75
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:22,750
it. That's okay. I can say that, right? That's okay. All right. Yeah. It's definitely better

76
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:32,669
than Until Dawn. But I didn't- I didn't even play it, really. I didn't- why are you asking us?

77
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:38,059
Because sometimes, if I say I don't- you know, if I said I- that Mass Effect 2- remember?

78
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:48,379
If I say Mass Effect 3- if I say Mass Effect 2 sucks, then I'll get tweets about it. People

79
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:55,519
will be like, fuck you, you're an idiot. You don't know anything about video games. I gotta be careful.

80
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:04,190
He's being hacked. I haven't played it, really. I don't- I'm not into the series.

81
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:14,769
Sonic Mania. It's probably- is it- I kind of feel the same way about Sonic the Hedgehog that I do

82
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,820
about Modern Warfare 3. The sound effects. Like, I only play Sonic to, like, hold down and go

83
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,480
I don't- I don't really care. And for the-

84
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,759
And then the-

85
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:50,029
I have trouble playing Sonic the Hedgehog. I feel like I- I have, like, ADHD and it's hard for me

86
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:57,220
to concentrate on a lot of things. So I'll be running very fast and it's just like- and I'll

87
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:10,850
hit like a fucking spike. I can't even pay attention to it. It's better than Smite. Of course it is.

88
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:25,679
If you guys would like to see the definition of recency bias, this is the only video game I've

89
00:12:25,679 --> 00:13:01,789
played off stream in the last six months. The only one. But it's fun! It's better- it's better

90
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:07,570
than Warframe. It is. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What else we got? GTA V.

91
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:14,139
Ah, it's close. I have to come back to this. I think GTA V is, like, one of the better games

92
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:24,399
to come out in the last, at least, like, 10 to 15 years. The GTA V story is, like, all right,

93
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,620
it's all right. It was cool. But just- hold on, now that I can give my reason why. The- the world

94
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:41,039
of GTA V is so- it's just peop- it's just people are alive. Just like the pedestrians and the

95
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:47,889
buildings and the mountains and so much time went into that city and that world. People have tried

96
00:13:47,889 --> 00:14:01,470
to do that since. Remember, GTA V came out in fucking 2013. 2013. Name me a game that's come

97
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,330
out recently that really kind of badly wanted to have that same vibe and it was a disaster.

98
00:14:16,990 --> 00:15:02,940
It better not be on this list. What is this doing on here? This definitely was made before

99
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:15,360
the game came up. This list was created probably, like, a couple weeks before that game came up.

100
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,659
The Avengers. It's- it's not on here. Okay, it's- I don't think it's on here. Somebody said it's on

101
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:27,470
there, but you don't even know which one I'm talking about, but maybe you do. Is it on here?

102
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:38,590
It's not on here. It's- look at these little icons. I can't even see. Is it on here? It probably is.

103
00:15:38,590 --> 00:16:00,879
This was probably made before it even came out. Bottom left. This is the games that I pre-ordered,

104
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:17,789
thinking they were gonna be the best game ever made. Uh, the list. This is unfair because I'm-

105
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:23,789
I'm just, like, bandwagon jumping Andy, right? And I know you're fucking sick of me saying that,

106
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:27,710
but it's- look, that's how- that's how we communicate in this generation. We say Andy.

107
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:37,019
I haven't played Cyberpunk. I just- it's bad because to- everybody told me it was bad.

108
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,419
Cyberpunk's bad because everybody told me it was bad. And I saw a clip of a car, like,

109
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:54,659
flipping upside down and, like, deleting. I can't rate it. I can't. I didn't play it.

110
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:02,179
It sucks. It's actually really fun. Well, there's two people right next to each other. They got-

111
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,500
it sucks, but it's fun. All right, so it's like Modern Warfare 3. Are there- wait,

112
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,210
are there sound effects in this game that- like, is it Modern Warfare 3? Like, when I really load

113
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:19,329
the gun, does it go like- so I could just be like, yes. No? Okay, then it stays down here.

114
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:44,670
I thought this said Bugleberry. What is that? Jungle Party? Is that a good game? Is this,

115
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:52,400
like, a game I've never played? Played Jungle Party. It belongs there. It does? I don't- I have

116
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,460
no idea what it is. It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece.

117
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:09,680
This is a paid ad to let it be on here. It does look like an old cereal box CD that was taped

118
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:20,240
to the back of the box. I don't- I have no idea what it is. All right. Okay. I only played the

119
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,900
first four hours or five hours of God of War, the new one, but my goodness was it

120
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:38,109
beautiful. It was fantastic. And I've been told that the first three or four hours of God of War

121
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:44,369
are ten out of ten, but the rest of God of War is like eight and a half out of ten. That's what I

122
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:49,390
have been told. I had the first, like, six hours is like a full ten out of ten, and then the rest

123
00:18:49,390 --> 00:19:14,049
is like an 8.6. Is that fair? You know, I don't play video games. All the games on this list,

124
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:30,509
I think I've played, like, for three to four hours. Dota 2, I've played for, like, three hours.

125
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:35,200
Yakuza, I've played for, like, four hours. Street Fighter, I've played probably a total of, like,

126
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,670
two to three hours. Halo Reach, I played an hour and ten minutes with Joel. Batman, Arkham City,

127
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,710
I played for, like, two hours because it was on sale for, like, the eighth time. Watch Dogs,

128
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:56,369
I played for about three hours on stream. Star Wars, Lego Star Wars, played for about four hours.

129
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:06,660
Ooh, Shadow of the Colossus is on here. Now that's a great, yeah, that's amazing. Borderlands 2,

130
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:16,880
is this the good one? German, none of them are the good one. Uh, what the fuck, dude?

131
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:39,230
Borderlands series, to me, is Overwatch Ultimates with the entirety of the time that you're playing

132
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:49,730
the game. That's how I felt. I just kind of felt like I was constantly in an ult in Overwatch.

133
00:20:49,730 --> 00:21:06,779
Holy shit, he's lost it. I didn't say it wasn't fun. I just remember, like, pressing Q every,

134
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:22,849
like, minute, and it was just like, and then I guess we won. Everybody in, like, Borderlands,

135
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,730
especially the later ones, they have, like, super moves that you can use every minute.

136
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,099
Get the super moves out of games. Can I say that? Get, take ultimate abilities out of fucking video

137
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,460
games. It makes them annoying. It makes them stupid. I don't like them. I don't like having

138
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,220
ultimate abilities that you just press a button and just, and everything dies and you do it once

139
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,230
every minute or two. No, let me have to fuck, I want to play. I don't want to just press fucking

140
00:21:51,230 --> 00:22:00,400
Q and have colors light up the screen. That's why Smite deserves to be a little bit higher than it

141
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:20,289
is. It's a bad take. I don't think it is, though, because it makes it, look, I know I'm not, like,

142
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:27,019
that good at video games, but when you have ultimates in games that just, just level everything in

143
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,480
front of you, when you play with more than one or two people, you just, you might as well just be

144
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,329
hanging out talking in a Discord call. You're not even playing. When, like, three of you have a

145
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:42,619
fucking Q button to press every two minutes, you're just hanging out and talking in a call

146
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,519
because it's like, all right, let's go in. You guys ready to go in? Just, like,

147
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,359
wipe everything out. Oh, we all pressed Q. All right, like, pick up the items, I guess.

148
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,109
There's another one. There's another fight. This one's a boss. Everyone pressed Q.

149
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:10,460
That's unironically correct. Thank you. Going off script now. Just wait till they add an ultimate

150
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,759
in the next Mario game and then all everybody can come back here and be like, man, you know,

151
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,519
you were kind of right about that. Just wait till you press, wait till you press, like,

152
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:28,319
fucking right bumper in, like, Mario Odyssey 2. And he goes like, and fucking spins and stars

153
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:34,420
go everywhere and, like, and everything gets fucking dies around him. Wait till it happens

154
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:50,940
and then you tell me I was wrong. You're a psycho. So, I mean, no, I'm not. I didn't play Uncharted

155
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,670
3. I didn't play fucking Uncharted 2. I didn't play fucking Uncharted 1. Ooh, this one's good.

156
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:16,240
That's very good. Whoa, I even said it. I have to put it up here. It doesn't, is there a doesn't

157
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,619
deserve to be on? I guess this is doesn't deserve to be on the list. All right. I'm changing.

158
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:27,309
Horrible is not horrible. Horrible is doesn't deserve to be on the list. That doesn't mean it's

159
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:33,920
a bad game. But when you're talking about the greatest video games of all time, I just don't

160
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:42,960
think they belong on the list. You got to put, like, you got to put Doom on here somewhere.

161
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,299
I don't even know what to put it, though. I think I played it for, like, wait, this is the remake.

162
00:24:47,299 --> 00:25:02,349
I played the remake on stream. Somebody get the exact time. Somebody get the exact time of how

163
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:16,289
long I played Doom. Is it more than four and a half hours? Four hours. It was four hours and 27

164
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:31,569
minutes. No, I'm way more suited to watch movies. Coming to this realization, if Doom was a movie,

165
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:43,059
I could give you, I could give you a good review. After four hours, not even TV shows either.

166
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:50,079
TV shows last whole seasons and hours and, like, tens of hours. I'm a movie guy and I'm coming to

167
00:25:50,079 --> 00:26:00,930
the realization here. Fake Doom fan. It was good. Hold on, let me just mute so I can get rid of this.

168
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:18,589
Whatever is wrong with me. Oh, Far Cry, Far Cry, Far Cry 3, dude. I didn't. Wait, is this Far Cry 3?

169
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:35,200
I played this on stream for four hours. I played this one off stream for one hour and uninstalled

170
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:48,609
it. Mortal Kombat 11 played it for like two hours, three hours. I didn't play Wind Waker. I know,

171
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:56,460
I didn't play Breath of the Wild. Finding of Isaac goes up high. No, I don't know if it's,

172
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:04,670
it's definitely an amazing, definitely. Final Fantasy, I don't even know which one it is. I

173
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:12,589
didn't play it. Watch Dogs 2. Both are bad. I'm sorry, they just are. That's how I, that's what I

174
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:29,220
feel. Mario Odyssey. I played for like three and a half hours. I got to the part where you walk in

175
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,099
the, I got to the part where, like, you walk in the pipe thing and it's like a do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

176
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:47,920
It's like all nostalgia and then I uninstalled the game. Don't ever listen to a thing I say about

177
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:59,410
video games. I have no experience. I am the best indicator for if you've got a good, if you got a

178
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:06,799
big first act, a really good first act, you'll know because I'll play the game. Everything that's

179
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:22,049
up here, notice how they all have really, really fantastic first acts, with the exception of Isaac.

180
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:38,019
Isaac and TF2 are sm- You okay? Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Are you alright? That was probably really

181
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:49,420
bad. I'm really sorry. Oh, there's like 16,000 people here. I'm really fucking sorry. I'm really

182
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,349
sorry. But these, you can do Binding of, you can play, you can beat Binding of Isaac technically

183
00:28:56,349 --> 00:29:03,359
in 30 minutes, 20 minutes. TF2, you just jump in a server and just walk around with a flog and just

184
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,920
burn people, light them on fire and crit them and get them to yell fucking swears at you in chat.

185
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:16,660
It's, you, it's, you don't have to do anything. You know, it literally takes five minutes.

186
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:23,730
All these have great first acts. I'm, this is a complete eye-opener. I don't, I didn't play any

187
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:38,079
Assassin's Creed. No, I don't play FIFA. I don't play Fortnite. Oh boy, what a first act this had.

188
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:48,799
The cinematic cutscene, getting into Dun Moro as the, as a dwarf, getting the, the voice lines

189
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,640
and collecting the stuff and getting going and going to meet, uh, Anduin Wynn at Stormwind.

190
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:08,940
What a first act. And, uh, don't give me shit for this. World of Warcraft, not the one that they,

191
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:14,960
like, resurrected and redid it again. No, the original one back in like 2004, 2005.

192
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,650
That was, it was really cool. It was insane. It was unbelievable. No one had ever done that shit

193
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,450
before. I don't know, EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest. What about EverQuest? Did you play

194
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:33,789
EverQuest? I did. And I, I, this was, I liked World of Warcraft better than EverQuest. Fuck you. Why?

195
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,910
This is going to be hard a little bit later. I knew this was going to take a long time. Overcooked

196
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,829
2 should just not be on the list. It just shouldn't. It's a cool, it's a, it's a cool game. It's, it's

197
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:47,220
fun. But it's not better than, like, Resident Evil 4. It's not horrible. It just shouldn't be

198
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:57,279
on the list. Pac-Man, all right. Pac-Man might not be better than Resident Evil 4,

199
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:14,140
but it might be more important than Resident Evil 4. That doesn't matter? What do you mean

200
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:32,220
that doesn't matter? How can you compare, like, to the first, like, the first act of God of War?

201
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:42,750
But you have whole generations of technology. Of course that matters. Yes, it does. Only Dark

202
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,190
Souls is only at very good. That's not true. I have to get this in the, I have to get it,

203
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,190
all of these are within one or two tiers of correctness. I need to go and fix it,

204
00:31:52,190 --> 00:32:03,420
but I need to get them up here first. Pac-Man's more important than God of War. It just is. I

205
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:10,259
could, I could look at that later. Metal Gear Rising. It was all right. It was okay. It was

206
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:16,539
fun. Metal Gear Solid 3. Is that Snake Eater? This is the best one. This is the best Metal

207
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:29,119
Gear Solid. I will die on that hill. I think this is the best Metal Gear Solid. I think it is.

208
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:35,380
Metal Gear Solid 2 was fun, but they had this, like, crazy, like, AI-generated script that you

209
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:47,440
just, they pumped it into your brain over the course of, like, 12 hours. I like Metal Gear Solid

210
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:57,680
3 the best. The first one was really good, too. That's a great series, though. Fantastic series.

211
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,240
Unbelievable series, but I think the third one's probably the best one. I didn't play The Last of

212
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,619
Us. That's a lie. I did play The Last of Us. Let me make sure I get this correct. Let me make sure

213
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,859
I get this correct. I might have some things missing and misremembering here. It was either

214
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:24,160
MLC Stealth or Italics. The PlayStation had a feature where you could screen share to somebody

215
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,180
and they could take control of the controller and play, and they did that for me with The Last of

216
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:40,589
Us for, like, 20 minutes. That's my entire time of play. It might be missing some details there,

217
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:54,910
but it was one of them. Maybe 30 minutes? Oh my. Thank God it's on the list I got. I was starting

218
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:03,869
to get a little concerned. And they've got the remake coming out. Please don't fuck that up.

219
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:18,159
Please don't fuck that up. Please. Blizzard, give us one thing. Diablo 4. Diablo 4 can suck

220
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:30,079
total ass. I don't care. Just, don't fuck with that one. Don't fuck it up. I would rather play

221
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:47,440
this than Diablo 4. Oh my God, didn't even see this. All right. What's the absolute masterpiece?

222
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,019
Where does it go? For a second I was like, I thought this was the Magic School Bus,

223
00:34:55,019 --> 00:35:04,159
and I was like, this is a TV show. Why is it even on here? Original Counter-Strike. All right,

224
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,840
my enjoyment from this game was not very good because I was terrible at it and it just made

225
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:19,809
me angry. I hated Counter-Strike because I was terrible. Does the game pissed me off factor

226
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:28,429
work here? I got so sick and tired of just turning a corner and watching a guy just go like this.

227
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:37,280
And I was gone. Like, crouch dad. I didn't even know what happened. And then it's like, okay,

228
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,260
I guess I'm going to wait. And I don't like the waiting either. I don't like waiting around.

229
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,940
So somebody would just, crouch dad. And then I would just be waiting for the, for what?

230
00:35:47,500 --> 00:36:04,900
No, I don't want to do it. No, I just, I don't, I didn't like it. I, I played so much Counter-Strike

231
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:19,199
and had just negative kills to deaths every game. It's definitely better than Smite. If you were

232
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:27,599
to take a screenshot right here and zoom in and put it, like, I would be an enemy of PC video

233
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:41,250
gaming. It's not accurate. I don't know if this is it. I have, I can clean it up to do it. All

234
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:49,949
right. Phantom Pain was very good. Did I pretend to like it more than I did to make sure I could

235
00:36:49,949 --> 00:37:02,500
have a fifth game in my top games of 2015? That's the real question. That's the tough one.

236
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Cause I did really like it. And by the way, I don't, I know I talked about it, but I don't

237
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:28,429
even remember giving the list. I woke up in my bed the next day. Like I remember starting that video.

238
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:32,110
It's not, no, it's, it was decent. It was, it was not better than three.

239
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:43,699
Tetris is fucking horrible. The game sucks. Only, and only, oh, listen, only smart people

240
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:49,949
put this high. Us dumb fucking idiots hate this game and think it's stupid. Yeah. You can tell

241
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:58,050
if like how smart somebody is, how high they put Tetris. Oh, Tetris man. Oh, amazing. I love Tetris.

242
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,409
Super. I love like the equations and no, no, no, no, no. I get this. I get, I fucking,

243
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:19,389
us idiots hate this game. I don't like Tetris. I just, it's the forward thinking and what piece

244
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:23,869
do you have next? And like, oh, get the, do the math problem. Like, oh, which can that fit there?

245
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:30,909
It's like, it's a big, no, too much, too much visual. Get it off. And there's no blood in this

246
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:48,610
game. So like, eh, eh. I fucking hate Tetris. Overwatch is not better than Smite.

247
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,179
Overwatch, is Overwatch, is Overwatch better than Smite?

248
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:21,440
Metal Gear Rising should not be this high. Hold on, I'll go back to it.

249
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:28,000
Was this Omega LoL? I don't play Soul Calibur. I have not played any of the Assassin's Creed

250
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,900
games besides the first one for guess how much time? I'll give you a hint. It's not five hours.

251
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:45,699
Call of Duty Modern Warfare? The original one. I'm one of those posers that started

252
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:56,690
playing Modern Warfare and Call of Duty at Modern Warfare 3. The original Doom. The original Doom.

253
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:09,329
Why am I saying it like that? Doom. The original Doom. This is unfair because all these old classic

254
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:15,340
video games are just automatically just placed up on this first or second row. That's kind of

255
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:35,389
unfair. Tetris. Tetris is stupid. Excuse me. Blood. Oh, what about, excuse me. Pac-Man dies

256
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:42,699
and he goes inside out and fucking disintegrates screaming. And you eat fucking people in this

257
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:54,860
game. You eat them. You crush their bones and stuff with your mouth. Arkham, I only played for like

258
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:04,579
three hours on a Steam sale. Dark Souls 3. Here comes, and here comes the never-ending debate.

259
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:08,579
Every one of the, okay, this is the worst part about doing a game list like this.

260
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,889
Every single Dark Souls game not only has to be right next to each other, but in the correct order.

261
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:21,059
Or I'm in trouble. You can't have this. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3,

262
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,300
Dark Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, with the brackets. They have to be right,

263
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:36,369
it has to be right. No, no, no, no, you're doing it wrong. I actually, I like Dark Souls 3 a lot.

264
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:47,170
I don't know if it's first act. First act is pretty good. What was a better first act?

265
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,780
Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 2 is the worst one. I think we can agree on

266
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:05,389
that one. All the Mario karts have been zero out of tens since Double Dash. Making a correct

267
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:15,699
statement here. After Double Dash, they all became zeros. What is this? Life is straight,

268
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:28,829
all right, hold on a minute here. This, I like, this was, I liked this. Better than Tetris?

269
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:50,590
Is Life is Strange better than Overwatch? Life is Strange is better than, I know you, but you

270
00:42:50,590 --> 00:43:02,860
can't say, oh, what, Life is Strange is better than Tetris? I cringe. I don't like Tetris.

271
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:11,280
I don't like Tetris. I think the game sucks. I didn't like Tetris when I was 12. I was like

272
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,599
nine years old playing it, eight years old on the Nintendo or something, on my Game Boy.

273
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,760
And I remember just being like, this game's fucking stu-, I didn't swear. But I was like,

274
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,059
I hate this. I don't like this game. Where's Bonk? By the way, if Bonk was on here,

275
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:41,039
he'd be up in fucking Masterpiece. Bonk is the best Game Boy game. And who talks about that?

276
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:51,539
Nobody but me. Final Fantasy VII. The only experience I have with Final Fantasy VII was

277
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,900
watching Burger Boy scream at his TV, jumping up and down, because he couldn't beat the last boss

278
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:10,639
over and over again. And this is like, like 19 years ago. And I think he got so mad. I remember

279
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:16,559
like, he got to the point where he was so mad moving around that he could unplug the controller.

280
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,349
And that made him even more mad. And he was jumping up and down, like jumping up and down,

281
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:27,219
controllers out of the port. So I'm, and that was my reasoning for never playing this.

282
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,989
I've never played Final Fantasy VII. I've just seen the final boss and an angry friend. So I was

283
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:49,179
like, well, fuck this game. Why would I play this? It's my only experience. But a great soundtrack.

284
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:55,809
And I've, I've seen the movies and they're good. The movies were pretty cool. I never, yeah,

285
00:44:55,809 --> 00:45:04,179
I know. I'm the person that didn't, I didn't, I watched the movies. No, they're not good.

286
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:12,579
They literally aren't. The movies aren't good. Advent Children. Yeah, that's the one I saw. That

287
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:25,579
was bad. Advent Children, Omega, lol. He doesn't know. Well, I didn't understand anything that was

288
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:37,840
going on, but I like, I like Katsith and I like, I think it's cool. But wait, but Katsith, those are

289
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:45,760
terrible. The only reason why I wanted to play, I must have Metal Gear Solid VII, which was wrong,

290
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:53,570
is because Katsith has dice and don't you like gamble to play? Don't you, he like throws dice

291
00:45:53,570 --> 00:46:01,389
into like it could be anything, right? That's cool. That's cool. I like that character. What

292
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:06,849
am I talking about? We're talking about Final Fantasy VII. What is he saying? What? Let him

293
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:12,480
enjoy something. What? Katsith was on screen for five seconds total in Advent Children. Yeah. And

294
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,980
that's the part where I stood up in the fucking theater and I screamed and clapping. And me and

295
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:26,050
one other person that thought Katsith was cool. And I pointed at them and I was like, you get it?

296
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:37,329
You and I get it. Ow, my elbow. And then he was like, holy shit, are you okay? And he ran over and

297
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:46,380
he like held my elbow and he like wrapped it up. And I was like, and then that's how I met

298
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:55,139
Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy. Anyways, Inside was good. No, no, get this off of really bad.

299
00:46:55,139 --> 00:47:21,500
I don't like the word bad for these. I have no, I don't play video games. Pokemon Emerald version.

300
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:36,130
I've never, I don't play it. Oh my God. The only experience I have in Super Metroid

301
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:48,480
was renting it from Blockbuster and somebody else's save file being there, right? And then opening it

302
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:49,840
and just hearing the

303
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:57,440
thing. And running around and shooting stuff. And I had no idea where the fuck I was going

304
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,639
because the map is all over the place. And you had to have known what you did before to do what

305
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,719
you're doing in the future. And I didn't want to start at the beginning. I did that for a lot of

306
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:13,010
games, by the way. How many of you guys rented games like RPGs, especially turn-based RPGs?

307
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,900
I did this all the time with Earthbound. I think I was too stupid to like really want to play

308
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,920
from the beginning. So I would just hope that there would be a save file that was more than

309
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,440
halfway through the game. And I'd be like, oh, nice. They're like halfway through the game.

310
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,420
And I would just walk around and fight stuff and just play on somebody else's save that they had

311
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:40,500
on the Blockbuster one and just enjoy maybe like 30 minutes. And then I would just stop. I just

312
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:48,050
wanted to enjoy somebody else's time in the game. Like I didn't want to start at the beginning.

313
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:57,170
You're a fraud exposed. That's weird. Earthbound street. I don't know. It was definitely because

314
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:05,489
I didn't get it. Especially turn-based RPGs. They were like too slow for me. They would be like,

315
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:08,769
wait, what do I have to do? I have to get the stick and equip the stick and then like walk

316
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:13,809
over to here to the town and buy this and then walk over here and fight. No, this is back when

317
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:22,210
pressing A as fast as I could was my skill, my skill set. So pressing A as fast as I could was

318
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,539
like a half of every Super Nintendo game. And if that wasn't in a Super Nintendo game, then I might

319
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:33,500
as well head back to sort of return to the Blockbuster. Papers, please was very good.

320
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:40,860
But again, I would always start Papers, please and get to the point when there was more than

321
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,340
three or four things you had to do. And that's where I would stop because I couldn't do it.

322
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,900
It'd be like, okay, you have to check the ID. I got to check their work order, where they work

323
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:58,460
and their passport. And this is too much. I don't want to do it anymore. The game is incredible

324
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:04,480
until you get to like the four things on the screen. It's very good though. It's up here

325
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:20,829
somewhere. Outlast 1, I actually really liked. But you can't put Outlast in front of Doom,

326
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:26,929
can you? We'll see. We'll see. I'll fix it later. Hold on. Is it going to get in the right place?

327
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:33,219
Persona. I've never played Persona. All I know is that I saw someone, I watched somebody play

328
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:36,980
Persona 3 for like 10 minutes. And it was a part where they were like just shooting themselves in

329
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:44,050
the head with guns. And I was like, oh, okay. Like that's how you fight. It was like, wow,

330
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:58,300
that's crazy. Sekiro was better than Dark Souls 2, but was lower on the list for Dark Souls games

331
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:05,789
for me. And no, it's not Dark Souls. I know. I know. I know. I didn't play Yakuza 4. I've

332
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:13,969
never played a Fire Emblem game. GTA 4 probably deserves to go in front of GTA 5 because

333
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,199
technologically speaking, when GTA 4 came out, it was insane and never done before. And by the time

334
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:28,670
GTA 5 came out, open world games having that much going on was pretty normal. So they kind of

335
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:35,500
started that. They did that really first. So I think it belongs in front of it. Even though

336
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:45,340
the video game might be a little bit worse than GTA 5, like the engine of the video game. I like

337
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:50,769
GTA 4. It was more, it was kind of crunchy, you know what I mean? It was like crusty in a way.

338
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:58,960
I liked it. It's like Breath of the Wild if you like open world. I will one day. Apex Legends

339
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:13,019
have never played it. Wait, the first Walking Dead Telltale game. I almost just like spoiled

340
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:30,449
everything. The Walking Dead Telltale game had a few really, really fantastic moments.

341
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:37,300
There was a few, and they were not short. They were, it led up to a lot of, there was a couple

342
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:44,639
things in particular. I was like, oh, that was, it was really cool. I don't think it was like,

343
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:55,500
whoa, amazing. It's the best game ever. It was good. I liked it. It belongs in the good to very

344
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:06,719
good. Was it better than Doom? Well, I have to fix that. Red? Oh, Devil May Cry. No, I haven't

345
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:12,699
played it. None of them. I have no time in any Devil May Cry. Yakuza Zero, I've played for like,

346
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:22,820
oh, I know, but I can't rate this because it's better than Tetris. It's better than Life is

347
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:29,090
Strange. It's better than Metal Gear Rising. Overwatch is worse. Overwatch is way worse.

348
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:34,989
No, it's not. It's better. Modern Warfare should not be over here. Modern Warfare should be,

349
00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:54,579
actually be down here. Like, let's be honest. I'm just thinking, if Until Dawn is down here,

350
00:53:54,579 --> 00:54:15,679
does Life is Strange deserve to be up here? I don't think Until Dawn was horrible. I don't,

351
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,280
honestly, I, this is cut off at the top. I don't even know what Far Cry it is, but it doesn't

352
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,460
fucking matter because every single one of them is the same game. I have no idea which one this is,

353
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:37,949
but all of them go down here. Is it three, four, five? I don't know which one it is.

354
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:46,500
Okay, Portal 2 and Portal. I'm gonna make a lot of people upset with this. I know,

355
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:56,719
first of all, there's a method to this. Hold on. Portal 2 was awesome. Portal 1 made me almost

356
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:03,500
throw up every time I played it. Portal 2 was spread out enough with different stuff in between

357
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:12,139
that I could get over how much I wanted to throw up. Portal 1 was just puke, puke, puke, puke,

358
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:17,119
puke. Just throw up puke, puke, puke. It was just puzzle puke, puzzle puke, puzzle puke.

359
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:25,309
It made me sick. The game Portal actually makes me ill, even in Portal 2. Portal 2 was more going

360
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:29,389
on. It wasn't just like go in this room and do a puzzle and then lie down on the ground,

361
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:36,179
which I did many times. I would complete a level in Portal 2 and be green and then I would lie

362
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:46,750
on the ground in where my computer was. I would lie on the ground and just wait till it passed

363
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:53,860
and then I would get up and do the next level. I couldn't handle it. That didn't happen in Portal

364
00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:02,380
2. This would be up way higher if it wasn't the way. I do think Portal 2 was better than Half-Life

365
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:10,719
1 just because it's, I don't know, it was newer. I liked Cave Johnson. Life gives you lemons. Get

366
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:22,219
some limes and half a sprite or whatever. He's had funny lines. Yeah, it belongs up here. Maybe

367
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:54,480
even a little higher. Put God of War down here. You just ruined my night. No, I'm just kidding.

368
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,570
Somebody, can I do this? I don't know why. I want to like make two cams. Have one of them be blue

369
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,650
and the other one be red and put them right next to each other transparent and like give you like

370
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:53,099
a 3D show. Can I do that? Color corrector. I need blue. Where's blue? Wait, color.

371
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:31,059
All right, that's red. Let me turn the brightness up. Is it gonna work? Okay, so there's that one

372
00:58:39,170 --> 00:59:03,949
and then I need blue. I'm gonna, this is gonna be 3D. Oh, I can't, why can't I duplicate it?

373
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:10,769
No, I want to, I want to duplicate this and make it blue. Why can't I do that?

374
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:23,659
Paste duplicate. Why not? Is this a virtual boy? I don't think I can do a dupli- yeah,

375
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:30,420
I had this problem before. Yeah, because I can only paste a reference. I can't paste a duplicate.

376
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:48,849
Why? That's really annoying. Let's do a virtual boy. Yeah, I can't. Why can't I paste a duplicate?

377
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:59,389
Does anyone know how to do this? Because I haven't been, I've been trying to do this for years.

378
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:06,050
Can I just add another source, which is this camera or is that not going to work?

379
01:00:06,769 --> 01:01:34,960
OBS can only take one camera. Like, hell it can. I'll be right back. Sorry, sorry, hold on,

380
01:01:34,960 --> 01:02:08,719
hold on. This is so fucked up. I broke it because I plugged a camera in. Hold on. You see? All right,

381
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,579
this one works. All right, all right, all right, all right, here we go, here we go, here we go.

382
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:34,980
I got it. I should have it. This is gonna be fucked up. I can't wait. All right, now I'm almost done.

383
01:02:34,980 --> 01:03:14,380
You see? Here we go. They gotta be in the same spot. This one's, this one's focus is fucked up.

384
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:27,489
Is it like grease on here? There was grease on it. There was a layer of grease. Oh, that's

385
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:54,579
disgusting. Okay, here we go. This one has to be blue. Did it work? I'm coming at you in 3D.

386
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:08,349
Okay, hold on. By the way, I gotta make this, I gotta, I gotta say this real quick. This is

387
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:12,449
probably, which camera do I look at? This is probably gonna hurt your eyes. This is probably

388
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:17,809
not gonna be, this is probably gonna suck to look at. So, I just want to make that really clear

389
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:21,250
right now. Like, just if you have like sensitivity, this is actually probably gonna be horrible.

390
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:28,340
Okay, so, make this, like you do it a little bit off to the side, right? I gotta make these

391
01:04:28,340 --> 01:05:08,590
close to each other. Can I get it? Hold on. Red needs to be brighter. I'm gonna, I'm gonna like

392
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:23,199
throw popcorn in your face. Okay, brighter. Better? All right, here we go. It's time for your 3D.

393
01:05:23,199 --> 01:06:04,480
You ready? I'm coming at you. I'm coming at you. They're off sync? Does that matter? Coming at you

394
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:11,860
live in 3D. Yeah, this is just, okay, when, you know when you go to the movies and you go to the

395
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:18,820
3D movie, and you realize that like halfway through the fucking movie, you really don't want

396
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:25,699
to watch it in 3D anymore, and you take the glasses off and you're just like, oh, Batman's

397
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:34,750
like punching the guy, and it's just like, and you're just like, I don't, can I, can we just go to

398
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:51,940
the other movie? This movie's fucking three hours long of this. Hold on, wait, ready? Just hit my

399
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:57,139
fucking monitor. I'm fine. It's not a heel. Hold on, wait, wait, wait. I need to.

400
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:38,340
All right, now we'll get your 3D glasses on eventually and watch that. I think, I actually

401
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:51,630
think it's probably gonna work. Okay, I'm fine. I think it's gonna work. All right, back to what

402
01:07:51,710 --> 01:08:07,869
we were doing. I was doing this. Let's go. So, hmm, more how? I mean, look at how many are still on

403
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:19,630
here. Well, this is the last thing we're doing, except something else. There's something else to

404
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:33,680
show you. In fact, why don't we go over this now? I have something to show you. I came across

405
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:44,449
something very interesting. You know, turn this off for a sec. So, in my hand here, I've got,

406
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:55,420
I've got a little thing. Now, it's not Catboy. I saw my uncle recently, and at a little family

407
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:04,930
thing, and he was shit-faced, and he told me that he had something, a family heirloom, that was very

408
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:13,439
important. I had no idea what he was talking about. I thought, it's not a carrot. It's not a carrot.

409
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:22,659
It's some kind of important document. So, he told me that it was probably worth a lot of money.

410
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:28,930
It was grandpa's secret. So, the curiosity got ahold of me, and I said, well,

411
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:35,710
can I see it? He said, no. He said, you can't. It's just fucking safer. Remember, he was shit-faced.

412
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:41,739
So, I said, listen, I'll trade you a trip to McDonald's. I'll take you to the drive-through.

413
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:49,949
And he thought about it for a second, and he agreed. So, I got, I got whatever this is,

414
01:09:51,260 --> 01:10:03,810
grandpa's secret, and we're going to open it right now. Are you ready? All it took was a

415
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:28,619
trip to McDonald's. What have we got here? This is a map. A map to what? Well, I mean,

416
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:33,920
that's obviously Las Vegas in the background. There's a treasure chest in the middle.

417
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:48,689
What is it? Is it a teaser trailer? Teaser is a bit, I mean, there's no information on here.

418
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:59,970
This is supposed to be Las Vegas. Vegas is landlocked. I, grandpa, I, there's no,

419
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:10,640
there ain't no water in Vegas. I don't think that's accurate. Anyhow, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

420
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,619
get some experts involved, and I'm gonna see if I can figure out what the fuck this is,

421
01:11:14,619 --> 01:11:24,880
because there's very obviously something here. I see, first of all, I see a hamburger up here.

422
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:39,840
I think I'm, I'm gonna look into this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna look into that. Oh, I, hey, hey,

423
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,100
drunk Uncle Frank, you may have made the biggest mistake of your life, because I'm gonna get

424
01:11:46,100 --> 01:12:00,590
whatever the fuck that is. Forgot about the wink. Why are you so red? All because of this. I'm

425
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:12,449
wearing like two, three layers. Porn acting. I've been that guy for a fucking year.

426
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:32,670
I felt, whoa, hold on, let's redo it. A treasure! I just like fucked up my neck.

427
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:47,539
I just pogged too much, and I just put a kink in my neck. Oh, holy shit, that fucking hurts.

428
01:12:49,439 --> 01:13:02,270
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. It hurts. All right, we're good. Oh, we're gonna figure out

429
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:10,609
what this means. Very, very, very soon. I'm gonna go do some exploring. I need to find out what that

430
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:30,739
is. What's your porn acting? Fucking neck hurts. That was a YouTuber acting? Oh, what did I do?

431
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:38,100
What did I do to myself? I pogged so hard that I just like, it was like,

432
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:51,380
I gotta take a bath. That's the hardest I've ever pogged. On camera, for sure. All right, let's,

433
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:58,460
let's go. You know, you know, you know, I'm thinking, you know what I'm thinking?

434
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:03,899
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking a good, I'm thinking, I'm thinking Saturday afternoon

435
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:17,500
sounds like a really good time to go maybe look for this. That's what I'm thinking. And if I were

436
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:25,659
to give a time on Saturday that I would be doing that and exploring and trying to find grandpa's

437
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:31,489
secret, whatever it is. Gosh, I would probably put the sus at 1 p.m pacific on Saturday,

438
01:14:33,710 --> 01:15:04,340
this Saturday, what I would do. What is it, nobody cares? All right, Mario 2. I always put Mario 2

439
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:16,770
in really bad. This two, all right, there are too many games on this list. There are way too many

440
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:25,600
games on this list. I can't do this. Dead Rising 2 was awesome, but was it better than Dead Rising 1?

441
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:34,350
Although I complained every single time I played it. I didn't play Deus Ex. I, where was, I played

442
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:48,880
Bully. I don't remember how good Bully was. I remember being, I remember it was good. I think

443
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:56,640
it belongs up here. Super Mario Galaxy 2, I didn't even play one second of it. Shadow of War

444
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:05,020
belongs up here, somewhere in good. I'll fix it. Crash Bandicoot, I never played it. None of them,

445
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,939
all three of them. I didn't, I just saw the demos at like the GameStop. I remember watching people

446
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:15,229
play them. The one that's like two minutes long. Only the PlayStation disc, I never played them.

447
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:26,029
Mario Galaxy, this is really good. That goes up in amazing. It's very, very good. Probably the

448
01:16:26,029 --> 01:16:34,239
best Mario game that I've played in probably the last 10 to 15 years. I didn't play Factorio.

449
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:40,800
Is this Superman? I don't know what it is. What is that? Is this one of the, I don't think,

450
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,899
I don't think I played that Monster Hunter. I didn't play the Indiana Jones one. I didn't,

451
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:52,189
I played Lego Star Wars. I mean, it was all right. It was decent. Yeah, but it was not,

452
01:16:52,189 --> 01:17:00,930
probably not better than Portal, though. Maybe. I've never played Roblox. I played this. This is

453
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:11,039
the Super Nintendo Zelda, right? That belongs up in great. Can we just, can these be free spaces?

454
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:21,970
Is this Ocarina of Time? Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. These have to be free spaces, like Bingo.

455
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:27,279
You can't, listen, you can't put on the greatest video games of all time list,

456
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:36,670
Zelda under good. These are free spaces. Zelda, Pac-Man, and Doom are free spaces up in amazing.

457
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:51,069
Yes, you can. It sucks. It does not suck. Resident Evil 7. The first act was amazing. The rest of

458
01:17:51,069 --> 01:18:02,380
the game was not very good. I'm going to put it down here. Terraria. I, I just don't, I'm not,

459
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:06,779
I just don't, I just not a big fan of Terraria. It was, I played it. I beat the game. Me and

460
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:14,590
Ster played it. I, it was all right. It was, I don't really like, I, I, listen, how do I word

461
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:20,140
this without having like a rock go through the window right now? I like Terraria. I think it's

462
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:24,779
a really cool game. I just don't like the way it plays. I just don't like the side scrolling like,

463
01:18:27,729 --> 01:18:47,739
it's fun. Let's get myself watering eyes from that. Play what? I'm going to sneeze. Am I? It's

464
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:58,380
coming. Rocket League. No, I never play, I don't play it. Skyrim. I played for four hours. Three

465
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:05,090
and a half hours were making monsters. So no. The Witcher 3. I never played it. Celeste was very,

466
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:12,699
listen to my voice. What's going on? Celeste was very good. Would I put Celeste somewhere over here?

467
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:39,649
Where do I put it? I didn't even play Doom 2016. I did for like three hours. Why is it even up here?

468
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:55,899
Where do I put the games that I've only played for four hours? Where do I put them? I can't say,

469
01:19:55,899 --> 01:20:03,869
oh wow, it's like, it's one of the best games ever when you play it for three hours. It's going down

470
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:16,739
here. Make a new tier and call it four hour Andy. Okay. Let's make a new tier. Add a row below.

471
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:35,439
Okay. Four. There you go. And that, it can be just like, I don't know, grayed out. A lot of games

472
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:54,350
are going up here. Oh my god. So many games are going to be on here. What actually? No, I haven't

473
01:20:54,350 --> 01:21:13,739
played Fortnite for more than 10 minutes. This is so bad. What else have I played for the four hours?

474
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:22,640
No. No. Batman. Modern Warfare, the original. Maybe because I downloaded it one day because

475
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:30,819
I wanted to try it. That's good. What about up here? Battlefield 1 is a four hour Andy.

476
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:42,050
Mario Kart 8. I, I, I'm not going to put it for our last of us. Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs 2. I want to

477
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:58,670
go, I want to go to bed so bad. Four hour fart. I've seen a lot of trans pride and I gotta make

478
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:12,350
something really clear. Please, for the love of God, I support LGBT rights. Full stop. That's a

479
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:21,020
full stop. And sometimes you look over and you see people very, very upset about that.

480
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:30,529
And I just gotta say, I gotta make it clear again, I don't want to see any, like, awful

481
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:36,210
shit. And we've seen, I'm gonna be honest with you, I've seen some really awful shit in this chat

482
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:44,399
about that. And there's the idea that, what about the spam? Spam is always taken care of. We have

483
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:55,760
a rule for spam. So there's no reason, there's no reason at all to, if you see the trans pride

484
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:03,819
emote, to automatically start to just throw awful shit into this chat. Spam will be taken care of.

485
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:10,670
Please, for the love of God, don't be such an asshole. Because I hate to say it, I really do.

486
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:20,909
I've seen stuff in this chat that I'm not, does not make me happy. So let me make that really clear.

487
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:38,369
I, I have to. Because, what about, thank you. Well, it's, I'll be honest, it's, it's hard to

488
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:44,670
talk about on stream. Because for some reason there is a percentage of people that just really,

489
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:51,260
really hate the fact that it's talked about. And I gotta make that really clear that I,

490
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:58,829
wherever you stand socially, politically, it doesn't matter. I don't bring that shit here.

491
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:04,449
Don't bring that negative shit here. I don't want to see it. And if I do, I'm gonna be,

492
01:24:04,449 --> 01:24:16,340
it's gonna be taken care of. It just is. You don't have to explain yourself. Well, sometimes you do.

493
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:32,220
Sometimes I do. There you go. That's, I want to make that clear. Get back to the, get back to this.

494
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:50,819
Yeah, we will. It was a good transition from the fart joke. Is that, is that how,

495
01:24:50,819 --> 01:25:02,449
that's not what happened? That's not what happened. Yes, it is. No, it's not. What fart joke?

496
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:18,510
I didn't make a fart joke. Or our fart. Oh, I did say that right before. Whatever. It doesn't

497
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:27,600
matter. I, doesn't, all right, let's, let's fucking go. You're the master of the segue.

498
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:34,850
It's so fucking hot in here. Like, and I, I just so badly want you to know what website I'm on.

499
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:41,460
You're here right now. I don't have to fucking wear this. You, I, why do I have to wear this

500
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:56,189
right now? Let's show the Andy Mark t-shirt. It's too, I don't know why. Like, hey, I'm on

501
01:25:56,189 --> 01:26:04,140
Twitch.tv. You see this shirt? Like, this isn't a doc. I don't have to wear like the lab coat.

502
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:16,880
It's not a doctor's office. Like, oh, I'm a doctor, you know. Twerk, please. Okay. That is so sweaty

503
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:28,800
and disgusting. I can't even tell you. Twerk. And now, hey, I'm almost as like red as the t-shirt.

504
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,739
It is so fucking hot in here. Why is it so hot in here? All right, let's go.

505
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:41,819
Lego Star Wars 2. I have, I have no idea. Uh, did I, I played Limbo on stream, didn't I?

506
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:53,539
It was for four hours. That's four hour Andy. That counts. Did I beat it on stream?

507
01:26:53,539 --> 01:27:03,310
Wait, it's a four hour game. Oh, okay. It was, it was all right. I liked it. Monster Hunter World?

508
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:08,510
Uh, I remember streaming Monster Hunter World with italics and getting so angry at the game

509
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:13,649
that I never played it again. So I'm going to say four hour Andy. That's a lie. I beat the whole

510
01:27:13,649 --> 01:27:29,539
thing with italics off stream. I thought it was all right. No More Heroes is a good game,

511
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:36,699
but a terrible video game. It's in, it's somewhere in here. Uncharted, never played them.

512
01:27:36,699 --> 01:27:42,060
Chrono Trigger, thank you very much. We're going up all the way to Masterpiece. Thank you very much.

513
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:57,020
Chrono Trigger's a masterpiece. It is. Uh, I never played this. I didn't play any of the Pokemon's

514
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:04,699
Jackbox Party Pack 6. That, that shouldn't be on here. Why is Jackbox Party Pack 6 on here?

515
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:19,779
Jackbox Party Pack 6? Hearthstone is on here? No, it's not. Oh my God, it is. This is decent.

516
01:28:19,779 --> 01:28:30,880
Firewatch, I, all right, it was decent. It was all right. Beat Saber, I don't, four hour Andy.

517
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,850
Silent Hill 2, four hour Andy. I only played it for like four hours. The Sims 4, four hour Andy.

518
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:54,239
Getting over it, four hours. Half-Life 2 was, show the photos. Go watch the video. Half-Life 2

519
01:28:54,239 --> 01:29:05,520
is not a masterpiece for me. It's not. There's a lot of subs. I missed all these. Uh, Mega Cheese

520
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:14,189
Nips, thanks to the five subs. James Morris, five subs. Volco, five. Ten from Lenny the Person.

No, don't stuff me. Delete that. And don't ever tell anybody. And don't ever talk about that.

549
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:56,560
He doesn't care? No, of course I do. It's just a lot. No, I, of course I do. Um, Miss, hold on.

More coming in. Five from Marshmallowy Ghost. Phi from David Cage Official Twitch. Something

Thank you Gaw for the five. Spicy Pepe's for the five. Ten from Nocturnal Turn. Wild Card

556
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:44,659
what to do. How do I turn the faucet off? How do I distract you guys? I think I know what to do.

557
01:34:46,340 --> 01:35:17,680
I think I know how to distract you guys. Quick, refund, refund, refund. Uh, 808 thanks for the

01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:26,180
five. Uncle Joe, five. Fourbugs, five. VGB, five. Feline, five. Evasive Milk, five. Somewhat Bleak,

Wild Card. I can't even read these. Five from Peaceful Hailey. Ten from Labster. Five from Nep.

561
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:52,989
All right, I'm going to continue with the tier list. From here on out, any community subs are

562
01:35:52,989 --> 01:36:01,460
going to be appreciated, but I gotta move on. I gotta stream. This is insane. This is over a

563
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:11,039
thousand gifted subs. Thank you everybody. This is unbelievable amount of subscriptions.

564
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:20,699
And it's over a thousand community subs. That's fucking crazy. Uh, I hopefully, hopefully I can

565
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:28,260
put Warcraft 3 in the right spot, otherwise I'm gonna lose subs. Uh, thank you guys, really.

566
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:34,859
Completely unnecessary. Thank you nonetheless. Hopefully I do good. Hopefully I can use your

567
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:46,899
money wisely. Thank you. Among Us Andy. I'm the person up for ten seconds, because then they'll

568
01:36:46,899 --> 01:36:55,119
have a full tech of ten seconds to really go over what they did wrong. Uh, Warcraft 3 was amazing.

569
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:01,060
It belongs up here. It does. Not the remake, the original one. I think it deserves to be up there.

570
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:09,390
Battlefront 2, never played it. Street Fighter 2, I've really, I've watched people at the arcade

571
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:13,970
play it, but I never, I never played it. Second Son, never played it. The Spider-Man game, that

572
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:24,050
should be up here under, under good. That's under good. Path of Exile, this is a four hour Andy.

573
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:29,260
Uh, Dishonored, that's a four hour Andy. Yakuza didn't play this one. Need for Speed didn't play

574
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:35,260
this one. Assassin's Creed didn't play it. Didn't play the Dragon Ball game. Minecraft. Do I put

575
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:44,859
Minecraft in, um, I don't think I put Minecraft in Masterpiece. I think it goes under great. High

576
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:53,600
rate. Doom 2016 is not, seriously, why is it even up here? It belongs down here. Spider-Man

577
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:59,420
belongs probably up here under very good. I really liked that Spider-Man game, it was really good.

578
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:06,770
Spec Ops The Line, I didn't play it. Crusader, I didn't play Crusader's Kings 2. I don't know

579
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:23,140
what that is. Um, Gmail? What is that? Oh, that's Gar, that's Garry's Mod. That's Garry's Mod. Is

580
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:38,619
Garry's Mod really like a masterpiece of a video game, or is it like a cool toolbox? It's good,

581
01:38:38,619 --> 01:38:45,229
but I don't know, it doesn't belong high that up there. Hi. Uh, Superhot. The original Superhot

582
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:51,810
was cool. Superhot VR was better. It's not on here, which is disappointing. Mordhau's not really bad.

583
01:38:51,810 --> 01:39:00,850
It was, it was good. It was, it wasn't better than Portal. Civilization. Didn't play any of the

584
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:13,409
Civilizations. Spore. Uh, Spore's gonna go up to good. Fallout 4, that's four hour Andy. Maybe six

585
01:39:13,409 --> 01:39:26,939
hour Andy. What just went in my eye? Super Seducer on greatest games of all time? Why? I never played

586
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:32,340
it, but why? Uh, this is another Far Cry, who knows what it is. It could be one I played, I don't

587
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:39,390
care, it just belongs down here. I may as well have never played it. Uh, Far Cry 5 is four hour Andy.

588
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:50,829
Guitar Hero, is this a mobile game? It's like a Facebook game. Hotline Miami. This goes up to good.

589
01:39:50,829 --> 01:40:00,380
Actually, very good. No, it's, I'm gonna keep it at good. That is a mo-, it's a Facebook game.

590
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:10,770
Fallout 76. I don't, why would I ever play this? Is this Pong? Pong is definitely four hour Andy.

591
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:20,829
I have probably played it three times. Yeah, absolutely. I didn't play Deus Ex. Didn't play

592
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:28,260
Dishonored 2. I played For Honor, that's also for four hours. Metro 2033, I played the whole thing,

593
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:34,699
and I did like it, but I don't think it was that great. No, I'm thinking of the next one. I liked

594
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:46,079
2033. Actually, I actually really liked 2033, it was great. Deus Ex. Yeah, I didn't play it.

595
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:53,760
This is Persona, I've never played it, didn't play it. What? No, yeah, I did. Back in like 2013 or

596
01:40:53,760 --> 01:41:10,189
something. Wii Sports? Um, it was good. I don't even know what that is. Guitar Hero 3 is four hour

597
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:17,380
Andy. I may have like in college or something played it once, twice maybe. I played Rock Band,

598
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:25,890
I played Rock Band a lot. Not Guitar Hero 3. Stalker, I streamed it for four hours. Ooh,

599
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:35,729
Cuphead. Cuphead belongs up here. Probably up at very good. When's a DLC come up for Cuphead?

600
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:57,949
Never. Oh no, what? It wasn't bad news or anything, was there? Postal 3 on greatest

601
01:41:57,949 --> 01:42:10,539
games ever, four hour Andy. Sniper Elite 3, four hour Andy. Undertale, uh oh. See, some of you took

602
01:42:10,539 --> 01:42:14,779
a screenshot when I was doing this. Like when I was moving this up and scrolling. Screenshot!

603
01:42:14,779 --> 01:42:17,739
So you can like link it to somebody that you know loves that game and now they hate me.

604
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:30,510
It's up here somewhere. Shadow, that's way too high. Shadow the Colossus has to go further down.

605
01:42:31,069 --> 01:42:46,369
I'm okay with this so far, but maybe not. We'll see. This is a Fallout wallpaper

606
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:50,529
for your computer, for desktop. I don't know which one it is, so I'm going to say I don't know.

607
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:57,649
No, it's four hours. It's probably Fallout 3. Wait, no, I played Fallout 3 on stream for

608
01:42:59,779 --> 01:43:07,039
four hours. Six hours maybe total. I've never played a Pokemon game before. Does it count

609
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:10,560
before hour Andy if I tried to stream it but it didn't work and I tried to play it? Not really.

610
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:23,380
Logic 2. Never played it. Um, which Hitman is this? Uh, belongs up here somewhere. I'll

611
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:33,340
figure it out later. We, something Play 2? Just Dance? No. Counter-Strike Source

612
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:41,649
is just going to go right next to Counter-Strike. One slot above because it has better graphics.

613
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:53,039
Let's Counter-Strike Go. Oh, well, whatever. It doesn't matter. Dead by Daylight, have never

614
01:43:53,039 --> 01:44:00,899
played it. I actually played and beat this whole game and I had one incredibly major complaint.

615
01:44:00,899 --> 01:44:06,500
This, the DuckTales remake was good. The music was great. It was awesome reimagining. Um, they,

616
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:14,689
there were way too many cutscenes. There's a cutscene every other screen in this game.

617
01:44:14,689 --> 01:44:19,819
I, it was like come, just let me play the fucking game. It was like cutscene, cutscene, cutscene,

618
01:44:19,819 --> 01:44:31,810
cutscene in like the remake of DuckTales the game. There's too many cutscenes. It was decent.

619
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:45,470
Why is Tetris in bed? Because I hate that game. In fact, it's going down because you just reminded

620
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:54,260
me to rethink of what I, why I put it here. I hate Tetris. I don't, I do not like it. I hate

621
01:44:54,260 --> 01:45:03,199
this game. I know, like Tetris 99 came out and it's, what a cool idea. It was such a dumb, stupid,

622
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:08,260
horrible, shitty video game. And then they came out with the Super Mario one and that one was

623
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:16,560
really good. I'm sorry. I know people, some of you probably really like this Tetris and it's,

624
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:22,819
I just hate it. I hate it. I've always hated it. And it's because I'm not good at it.

625
01:45:22,819 --> 01:45:28,109
I'm not good enough to play it, to be good at it. And that angers me and it makes me not like it.

626
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:36,140
So take that as you will. Mad because bad. That's yes. Yes. Mad because I, I, I hate Tetris because

627
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:50,000
I'm not good at it. At least it's better than the Avengers game. Don't you feel like the Avengers

628
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,989
game was a dream you had? Wow. The Avengers game so hyped up for the Avengers. Like that's the

629
01:45:56,989 --> 01:46:02,609
dream where like you think it's real, but the thing it wasn't real. Wow. How awesome would it

630
01:46:02,609 --> 01:46:13,949
be to have a never ending like action adventure, like kind of you, you watch words, an action

631
01:46:13,949 --> 01:46:21,310
adventure game where you play as the Avengers and you go and fight stuff and it doesn't end.

632
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:24,909
And it's like a game as a service kind of thing. And they keep adding stuff and there's like boss

633
01:46:24,909 --> 01:46:29,630
fights. It's like multiplayer. We've wanted that for so long, Gordy. We've wanted that for so long,

634
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:36,640
Gordy. And yeah, yeah, I know. But I feel like I dreamt that and then it wasn't, it didn't exist.

635
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:49,810
Hold on. Somebody said, somebody just said this. Is Genshin Impact a better Marvel Avengers game?

636
01:46:49,810 --> 01:47:02,670
It is, right? It has to be. I would love to play it. First time I downloaded Genshin Impact on my

637
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:08,300
iPad, I got a black screen. I could walk around with the character, but the entire environment

638
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:14,699
was black. Couldn't play it. Uninstalled it. Two or three fucking months later, I go back and I

639
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:24,189
reinstall it. This time, I can't even get to the actual main menu of the video game. I sure would

640
01:47:24,189 --> 01:47:30,300
have loved to have played it on my iPad. So I uninstalled it again. So maybe like another two

641
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:36,930
or three months after they do some more bug fixes on the iPad version, I'll try it again. I'm not

642
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:43,680
going to play it on PC. No, I want to lie in bed and just run around and hit stuff until I pick up

643
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:50,539
loot cases and stuff. I don't want to play that on PC. That's not a PC game to me.

644
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:58,850
That's a like in the bath game to me. That's a like sprinkle in some bath salts and like light

645
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:05,890
a candle and just play Genshin Impact for like 30 minutes and then get out of the bath. That's not

646
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:21,840
a PC game for me. You're a crackhead. Stop getting sidetracked on the most random shit. Take every

647
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:29,260
stream I've ever done and pull out the times I get sidetracked and if it's less than 60% of everything

648
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:37,920
I've ever recorded, you win. If getting sidetracked is not like at least 60%, then you win.

649
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:46,100
I don't know why you don't really win anything. You win the thought. You win knowing that you

650
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:55,819
were right. No, don't triple the debt. No. Lance vs. Zombies. This is the first one, so it belongs

651
01:48:55,819 --> 01:49:04,539
up here. The second one, I would love to just like snot rocket it out of existence on here.

652
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:13,680
It better not be even on here. Mountain Blade Warband. You know where that goes. Last of Us

653
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:24,420
Part 2 didn't play it. Journey didn't play it. Um, this is, this is Near didn't play it. Kingdom

654
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:30,850
Hearts 3 didn't play it. Rainbow Six Siege, 4-hour Andy. Death Stranding didn't play it.

655
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:41,460
Animal Crossing, 4-hour Andy. System Shock 2 never played it. Divinity never played it. Dying Light

656
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:50,050
was, was okay. I wouldn't put it in like best game ever. Untitled Goose Game was better than Dying

657
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:56,859
Light for me. It belongs somewhere up here into good. We'll figure that out in a minute. Oblivion.

658
01:49:56,859 --> 01:50:05,630
I streamed it like two or three times for what? Three, four hours each? That's not 4-hour Andy.

659
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:13,500
It was all right. I had fun. I can't believe this is even on here. It's like honestly,

660
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:22,130
I'm 4-hour Andy. Yeah. Dawn of War 1? If it's Dawn of, if it's Warhammer 40k Dawn of War, then

661
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:33,140
it belongs up here. I loved the original Dawn of War. I thought it was fantastic. It belongs up here.

662
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:39,920
We'll figure it out. Turkey Sandwich. All right, so I got, I've gotten to the point where I haven't

663
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,439
played any video games in my whole life and I thought this was the list to choose from.

664
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:52,000
No, we're almost done. I didn't play Sly Cooper. I never played NBA 2K20. No Pokemon games ever.

665
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,710
I never played Persona. Never played Grounded. I don't even know what this is, so I'm gonna say

666
01:50:57,710 --> 01:51:14,270
no. No More Heroes 2 belongs up here. No More Heroes 1 is better. It's not, in a way.

667
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:20,180
Oh, Tsushima. I really wanted to play Ghost of Tsushima. Metal Gear Solid. I think this is,

668
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:27,920
Metal Gear Solid is fantastic. That's gotta go up to amazing. Okay, I'll find the play

669
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:33,899
sport in a minute. Didn't play Yakuza. Didn't play Call of Duty Cold War. I didn't play Doom

670
01:51:33,899 --> 01:51:42,590
Eternal. Didn't, no Crusader Kings. No Bayonetta. No Super Limital. No Wasteland 3. Oh, Hades.

671
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:56,130
This goes into, this goes into great. Where? We'll find out. I don't know what that is.

672
01:51:56,130 --> 01:52:09,090
Payday 2 belongs in 4-hour Andy. Half-Life Alyx. I talked about this when I beat Half-Life Alyx.

673
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:21,659
Half-Life Alyx is better than Half-Life 2, and that's recorded now. I think it is.

674
01:52:23,649 --> 01:52:42,020
That's wrong. I don't think it is. Where is Half-Life 2? This is a lie. This is, this is a lie.

675
01:52:42,979 --> 01:52:54,260
This has to be up here because I, I game on PC. It's not true. That's not true for me, and I have

676
01:52:54,260 --> 01:53:00,319
to break out of the, out of the deceit and the lying. I don't think that Half-Life 2 is like a

677
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:12,960
masterpiece. I think Portal 2 is more fun. I think I enjoyed Portal 2 more than Half-Life 2. I'm

678
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:25,149
sorry. I still find it to be very, very good. I just, I think Half-Life Alyx is better. By a lot.

679
01:53:25,149 --> 01:53:44,420
I'm calling Gabe? Yeah, call him. Sure. And tell him that the next one in the series was way better

680
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:50,029
than the last one. I'm sure he's gonna be really happy. Imagine knowing that you tried to live up

681
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:55,069
to Half-Life 2 and somebody said it was better than Half-Life 2. He's gonna be real fucking

682
01:53:55,069 --> 01:54:01,199
happy to hear that. He's gonna be ecstatic to know that because they were very concerned about that.

683
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:05,279
Like, oh, how do we do another Half-Life? Can we live up to Half-Life 2? Oh, you, oh, you,

684
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:16,510
you guys did. I thought it was fantastic. Where is it right now? That was Game of the Year last

685
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:21,310
year too. That was the best game that came out last year. And Hades. But Half-Life Alyx is better

686
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:27,380
than Hades. This shit wasn't even, it wasn't even nominated. This wasn't even nominated for Game of

687
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:31,859
the Year. And it was the best game that came out last year. Are we gonna judge things based on how

688
01:54:31,859 --> 01:54:48,000
good they were? That was like the most fun I had in a video game last year. Yeah, there are some

689
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:55,390
movies that get nominated for awards that are in select theaters. So what's the difference? It's

690
01:54:55,390 --> 01:55:10,050
VR. VR is expensive. Viewers are dropping. What do I do? Hold on. Uh, make noises and make sounds.

691
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:19,470
Uh, how do I get them to stay? Make, I gotta make sounds and make noises. Quick, do doi doi doi.

692
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:29,939
I, I don't know how to do it. I broke it.

693
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:41,520
I don't, I don't know how to do it anymore. I think I fucked it up. Of course I know how to do it.

694
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:52,210
Shovel Knight. Didn't play it. Not even 4-hour indie. I think I opened it on Steam

695
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,979
and like jumped around for like 10 minutes or something and then was like,

696
01:55:55,979 --> 01:56:00,289
I'll play this later. And I played it. Don't know what that is. Don't know what this is.

697
01:56:00,289 --> 01:56:06,079
Didn't play the Batman game. Hollow Knight. That's, that's more than four hours, right?

698
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:17,279
I streamed this like two or three times. Was this four hours? I really liked it.

699
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:24,979
The reason why I could never go back to Hollow Knight was because I got halfway through the game

700
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:30,399
and then didn't play it for, what, like four or five months? And the game is a,

701
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:35,859
it's one of those, you have to remember where everything is. This huge map with all the

702
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:39,859
different areas. And this one, you have to have the jump. You have to have the dash to go over here.

703
01:56:39,859 --> 01:56:43,300
And I just forgot everything. And I would have had to restart the whole game. I didn't want to

704
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:48,340
restart the entire game because I already did it. And it was like four months ago. Maybe I could,

705
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:59,470
maybe I, I don't know. Should I restart it? I will help you. I thought it was really fun.

706
01:57:00,029 --> 01:57:15,409
Oh, I think it's too late. I think it's too late. I did like it though. Uh, never played it.

707
01:57:15,409 --> 01:57:22,319
Didn't play it. Uh, I don't know what that is. I think it's Final Fantasy. Subnautica. That's,

708
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:30,270
you know where that goes. Warzone. Didn't play it. Titanfall God. This is Titanfall 2. I didn't

709
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:38,670
even play it. Orion the Blind Forest. Didn't play it. Mega Man? No. Is that Mega Man? Samurai

710
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:46,510
Warrior. Oh, um, I don't know what that is. Saints Row the Third. I didn't, I didn't even play it.

711
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:55,500
Maybe for like 10 minutes. Flight Simulator. Didn't even play it. Hitman. This is Hitman.

712
01:57:55,500 --> 01:58:06,460
Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This goes up here. Okay. Before I get this completely done,

713
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:12,140
before I do this and fix this, I want to tell you what my favorite ice creams are because I

714
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:18,340
got to get that out of the way really fast. Vanilla. B. Rocky Road. I'm going to, I'm not

715
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:26,750
going to think about it. Rocky Road. C. Peanut Butter. D. Pistachio. A. Birthday Cake. Way too,

716
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:30,819
it's kind of good, but it's way too sugary, way too heavy. Cheesecake. Strawberry cheesecake. A.

717
01:58:30,819 --> 01:58:40,770
Eggnog. D. Cherry. D. I don't know. Peppermint. C. Bubblegum. D. Rum Raisin. D. Mint Chip. B.

718
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:43,810
Brownie Batter. That's somewhere, that's up here. Hold on, don't even think about it. Lemon Custard.

719
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:50,880
D. Coffee. You have to be in the mood for it. C. Uh, Creamsicle. Like a cre, like Creamsicle. Creamsicle.

720
01:58:50,880 --> 01:59:01,970
B. Peach. C. Mango. B. Neapolitan. Moostrex. B. Beer. D. Blue Moon. Don't even know what it is. D.

721
01:59:02,529 --> 01:59:07,710
Chocolate. B. Superman. Don't even know what that is. That looks like fucking Play-Doh.

722
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:15,659
This is Play-Doh. That's not real, that's not ice cream. Cotton Candy. D. Black Raspberry. B.

723
01:59:15,659 --> 01:59:22,350
Coconut. C. Raspberry Ripple. I don't even know what this is. Grape. C. Cookies and Cream. S.

724
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:31,229
Chocolate Chip. Basic. Strawberry. S. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. S. Butter Pecan. Without the

725
01:59:31,229 --> 01:59:36,750
pecans in it. S. With pecan, if I, I, I put the pecans in my mouth and I get the ice cream off

726
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:48,079
and I spit it back in the container. Until, uh, this is just ice cream. Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.

727
01:59:48,079 --> 02:00:32,210
Alright. No. Peppermint is, Mint Chip is just way better. No, it's not done. Now it is. There you go.

728
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:39,119
Alright, back to what we were doing. Alright, this is important. We're gonna start from the bottom up.

729
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:44,779
So, of all the games that I have only played for four hours, what's the one I think is the best?

730
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:52,130
Probably Odyssey. It's not, not Dota. Not Borderlands. No way. I've played The Sims for

731
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:57,789
longer than that. But The Sims 4 is not even the best one. It's like The Sims 2 or The Sims 3.

732
02:00:57,789 --> 02:01:06,539
I should play The Sims 1. Alright, mark this on your calendar. I'm gonna play The Sims 1. Like,

733
02:01:06,539 --> 02:01:14,159
soon. In the next week or two. Like two, three weeks from now or something. It's alright. Okay.

734
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:23,539
So, definitely not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. I put all these games I put in,

735
02:01:23,539 --> 02:01:26,500
like, the same category. Like, I just, I've only played them for, like, a few hours and I don't,

736
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:38,590
like, all the four-hour games have to be in the same place except for Mario Galaxy. Horrible.

737
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:43,470
Uh, Avengers is probably the worst game ever, right? Like, it has to be. Mario Kart, I don't

738
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:48,500
like the Mario Kart. It's not overcooked. This doesn't belong here. Four-hour, Andy. I only

739
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:56,340
played it for, like, three hours on stream with, like, italics. Alright, that's perfect. That's

740
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:04,289
more accurate for me. Alright, um, Until Dawn, I just don't think that, I don't think they're

741
02:02:04,289 --> 02:02:08,210
bad games. I just don't think they belong, like, really on the list of best games ever,

742
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:24,750
but we'll just keep it here. Modern Warfare 3 better than Warframe? No. Is Far Cry 3 better

743
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:44,380
than Modern Warfare 3? Is Until Dawn better than Modern Warfare? Yes. Yes. No. Okay, that's,

744
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:50,180
that's fine. Alright, now this is really important. Is Warframe better than Far Cry 3? Yes. Is

745
02:02:50,739 --> 02:03:00,779
DuckTales Remastered better than Warframe? No. Warframe moves up. Is Mordhau better than

746
02:03:00,779 --> 02:03:26,449
Hearthstone? Hearthstone's better than Firewatch. I mean, what? Firewatch was cool, but it just,

747
02:03:26,449 --> 02:03:33,810
it did, it was, I liked the experience, but it was just, alright, let me just tell you. I was one of

748
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:39,539
those, I was one of those, I, look, the game's been on for, like, fucking seven years. I was one of

749
02:03:39,539 --> 02:03:55,060
those people, I, I didn't like the ending. I didn't like the end of the movie. Is it? And

750
02:03:55,060 --> 02:04:00,300
I felt like the entire thing was building up to the end of the movie, and I wasn't a big,

751
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:06,180
I didn't really like the end of the movie. I liked the movie, I liked the experience. I did,

752
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:10,659
it was a good, it was fun, it was, it was decent, it was good, but I felt like the whole thing was

753
02:04:10,659 --> 02:04:14,750
leading up to the end, and I was like, well, I didn't really like the end. If the whole thing

754
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:20,800
was leading up to the end for me, then I wasn't a big fan. The photos were, yeah, it was alright,

755
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:29,020
it was fun. For those of you that don't know, The Photos Are In is my favorite video that I ever

756
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:35,710
made on the channel. That's my favorite video. I get asked that all the time, and it's hard for me

757
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:45,579
to pick, but that's, like, that's my favorite video I ever made. Derma Rumble Live was awesome,

758
02:04:46,529 --> 02:04:50,449
but I, I don't know, I still think that that's, like, my favorite video I ever made.

759
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:58,180
That's the video I show people when I introduce them to you. Well, that's a weird one to pick.

760
02:04:59,810 --> 02:05:08,300
Anyways, Portal is better than Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike's better than Dying Light,

761
02:05:08,939 --> 02:05:12,460
Dead Rising's better than Dying Light, it's just a, it's just a better version of the same kind of

762
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:16,539
game for me. No More Heroes is better than Dying Light, all these are better than Dying Light,

763
02:05:16,539 --> 02:05:26,079
all of them. Smite is definitely, no, it belongs here. Dying Light just really kind of belongs all

764
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:36,260
the way down here. Yeah, it was alright, it was good, yeah, it was good, but, alright. Name me one

765
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:42,300
character's name from Dying Light. Any character in the whole game, name me a character's name.

766
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:58,850
You understand? Kyle Crane. If you just, you can't just go to Google and type in

767
02:05:59,729 --> 02:06:07,489
Dying Light characters and just pick one, you know what I mean. I can't, I can't name you one,

768
02:06:07,489 --> 02:06:18,619
they're all just a, just blank face. I can't name you anything. All I remember is me and Sterr

769
02:06:18,619 --> 02:06:24,510
chasing this weird zombie around and he ran into a fence and killed himself. That's the only thing

770
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:30,189
I remember, that's the only thing I pulled from that game. It's on, sorry, it's on, it's on Sterr's

771
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:40,590
video. It was really funny. And I remember Sterr throwing an axe into somebody's head.

772
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:46,460
Somebody was like standing there like we were looting somebody and like an axe just hits him

773
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:54,529
in the skull. Oh my god, what's with my eyes? And then, oh, that's where the meme is from,

774
02:06:54,529 --> 02:06:58,930
that's where Coffee's Cheeto, that's where that's from. But that was a secret video, that was not

775
02:06:58,930 --> 02:07:07,890
in the main video. That's a secret video, that's not the main one. Alright, let's continue. I think

776
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:15,949
I like where this is all standing right now. Whose is better than That'll Get Rising? Is it

777
02:07:15,949 --> 02:07:22,420
Limbo's? Okay, Star Wars, this has got Star Wars in it, it's better than Overwatch. Alright,

778
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:29,569
now it's going to get tricky. This is where it becomes hard. I really did like Shadow of War,

779
02:07:29,569 --> 02:07:36,659
I thought it was fantastic. This goes down, this goes down, this goes down, this goes down,

780
02:07:36,659 --> 02:07:43,630
this comes up, this goes down, this goes up, this goes down, this goes down, this goes down,

781
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:54,640
this goes down, this one goes down, this goes down, this goes up, actually, this one goes way up,

782
02:07:54,640 --> 02:08:07,149
way, way, way, way up, this goes up, that goes down, that goes, this goes up, this goes up,

783
02:08:07,149 --> 02:08:20,050
that goes down, that goes down, so does this, this one does too, to here, this one goes down too,

784
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:35,680
that one goes down as well, this one goes up. We got it? Yep, this goes down.

785
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:59,779
Prairie was like more fun than Metal Gear, no it wasn't. Close. Level up for Shadow of War. Shadow

786
02:08:59,779 --> 02:09:05,859
of War is better than Plants vs. Zombies. God, yell at me. Metro, is Shadow of War better than

787
02:09:05,859 --> 02:09:32,619
Metro 2033? That's very close. Say 2033 33 times. 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,

788
02:09:32,699 --> 02:09:41,899
2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,

789
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:50,539
2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,

790
02:09:50,539 --> 02:10:02,180
2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,

791
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:12,460
doing that made me realize it's better than Shadow of War. Thank you. Oh, you know, you guys ever

792
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:18,460
look in the mirror and you get terrified, not of losing this, not of having like, like get crow's

793
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:24,060
feet here. No, no, no, no. How many of you guys have fucking horrified at the notion of eventually

794
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:36,369
having this? Like, I don't want that. Like, I don't, I don't want that. And it's going to happen to

795
02:10:36,369 --> 02:10:47,819
everybody. Just that like sagging, weird fat pocket that's under the chin. I, I get,

796
02:10:47,819 --> 02:10:52,939
make me bald, have me have crow's feet, wrinkles everywhere. Do not give me the turkey neck. I

797
02:10:52,939 --> 02:10:57,739
don't want it. It's, I, it's one thing I really don't want. And it's already kind of happening.

798
02:10:57,739 --> 02:11:08,300
We're gonna do like exercises. You like go put your chin up, right? You have to do exercises.

799
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:21,500
Uh, Plants vs. Obvious is going down and Hotline Miami is going up. So is Celeste.

800
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:35,390
Spider-Man was better than, oh, that's tough. Sekiro was not better than Cuphead. Sekiro was,

801
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:57,199
this is hard. Now it's really hard. Um, Sekiro was good, but Dark Souls is leveling up.

802
02:11:57,199 --> 02:12:08,189
And so was Dark Souls 3. Left 4 Dead 2 was very good, but it's going down. Red Dead's leveling

803
02:12:08,189 --> 02:12:19,380
up to great. Fallout was, mm-hmm. Yep. This is leveling up as well. The losing viewers.

804
02:12:19,859 --> 02:12:26,380
Well, it's because every time I move a game that's your favorite game up a slot or down a slot that

805
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:31,460
you didn't agree with, you leave. So when I just put left, when I just went from Left 4 Dead from

806
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:38,819
two, from great to very good, this is somebody here's favorite video game. And they went and

807
02:12:38,819 --> 02:12:44,000
they fucking click the X. And it happens for every single one of these, because statistically

808
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:49,890
speaking, if there's 14,000 people here, somebody in here has a favorite game on this list. It's

809
02:12:49,890 --> 02:12:53,890
every single one of you. Like this is somebody's. This is somebody's. This is somebody's. All of

810
02:12:53,890 --> 02:13:01,420
this is somebody's favorite game. So when I take Cuphead and I go like this, two, three, 400 people

811
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:10,739
just collect X. That's how it works. All right, let's go. Is Mario 2 better than Left 4 Dead 2?

812
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:48,449
They both have two in it. Level up. Level up. Level up. D level. D level. No, no way. You know

813
02:13:48,449 --> 02:14:18,590
what? D level. Resident Evil 2 was more fun for me than Dark Souls 3. Is Minecraft better than

814
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:42,479
Dark Souls 3? Half Life 2 is. The Half Life games are better than Dawn of War and Hades and Cuphead.

815
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:52,460
Yeah, they are. They are. BioShock is definitely. Oh, this is going to make people so angry.

816
02:14:54,979 --> 02:15:02,189
Me even, me even remotely considering scrolling my mouse this way. Put this in front of this.

817
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:32,720
It's not good for a lot of you. I'm considering it. It's close. I played way more. It has to go

818
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:37,979
down there. That's fair. That's accurate. Like it has to be down in 4 hour ante.

819
02:15:38,699 --> 02:15:51,409
Because I only played it for like fucking five hours. None of these other games that I played

820
02:15:51,409 --> 02:16:01,300
for four hours, right? No, I've played a shitload of all of these up here. Yeah. All right. This is

821
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:12,350
good. I'm happy with this. Minecraft is better than Resident Evil. Minecraft is better. Minecraft is

822
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:20,899
better than Hitman. Hitman is. Resident Evil. Yeah, Hitman got D leveled. Sorry, you got D ranked.

823
02:16:20,899 --> 02:16:26,529
Oh. Oh, how far is Hitman going to fall here though? Is Cuphead better than Hitman? Yeah.

824
02:16:26,529 --> 02:16:34,299
Hades better than Hitman. Close. Yeah. Isaac. Yeah. Here we go. This is where it gets much harder.

825
02:16:34,299 --> 02:16:46,700
I think that's where it stops. Look, if Pac-Man gets to be up here and Doom Classic gets to be

826
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:53,809
over here, Minecraft, like Minecraft is one of those games that's going to be the Pac-Man when

827
02:16:53,809 --> 02:17:13,309
you and I have 50. Okay. I'm done. Wait, Half-Life 2 better than Dark Souls 3?

828
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:24,299
Yes. All of these are better than Dark Souls 3. All right. Half-Life 2 better than Resident Evil 2.

829
02:17:34,719 --> 02:17:43,979
No, it's not. Not for me. I loved Resident Evil 2. I loved it. It was like my favorite game of the

830
02:17:43,979 --> 02:17:53,659
year. I thought that was fantastic. I loved it. Like when I finished Half-Life 2, I was like,

831
02:17:53,659 --> 02:17:59,260
wow, that was awesome. That was unbelievable. When I finished Resident Evil 2, I said,

832
02:18:00,059 --> 02:18:12,030
that's one of the best games ever. I said that kind of, maybe I should just level it up. Yeah,

833
02:18:12,030 --> 02:18:19,100
it's leveled up. And by the way, Fallout New Vegas just got leveled up too. And guess what? Doom is

834
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:24,450
going down here. I don't care. A game came out in the fucking sixties or whatever. I don't care.

835
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:35,360
It's classic. Sure. But what's it doing up here? These two have to be next to each other because

836
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:46,430
they're about to fight each other. Mirror. That's fair. Pac-Man does not go down too. I love

837
02:18:46,430 --> 02:19:01,059
Pac-Man. It goes down here. Because that means Half-Life 2 is like the best in its category for

838
02:19:01,059 --> 02:19:11,120
like a great game. But the other games up here on this list, I need to just triple check and make

839
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:18,989
sure I had more fun in them than I did Half-Life 2. Because this is now the barometer for like a

840
02:19:19,069 --> 02:19:34,139
great, very, very, just great experience. Find out. Pac-Man. Fine. Fine. Resident Evil 2 stays up

841
02:19:34,139 --> 02:19:45,819
here. Minecraft that's staying up here. Ocarina of Time. I put the nostalgic glasses just on.

842
02:19:46,540 --> 02:20:14,750
Ocarina of Time. Dark Souls 1. I got to find the one that's like, what is my fucking favorite game

843
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:20,030
that's not quite masterpiece. What is it? Or does one of these get leveled up? It does.

844
02:20:21,219 --> 02:20:26,209
GTA 4 is a, is a fucking masterpiece. One of the most revolutionary games ever made.

845
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:33,819
It had so much going on. So much to do. It changed everything. It was a, it was one of the first true

846
02:20:33,819 --> 02:20:41,969
real living open world games. It's a masterpiece. GTA 4 is a masterpiece. It is. I think it belongs

847
02:20:41,969 --> 02:21:01,600
up here. What about San Andreas? San Andreas is not on this list. Resident Evil 4. Okay, hold on.

848
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:06,239
Metal Gear's got to go down here. It's an amazing game, but it's not, it's not quite up here.

849
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:22,379
Where would I put San Andreas? Honestly? Probably right behind GTA 4. Or right here. I, I, GTA 4 is

850
02:21:22,379 --> 02:21:28,989
like one of my favorite games ever. I like loved this game. It was, I loved it. Maybe down here.

851
02:21:28,989 --> 02:21:44,290
Like right here. Okay. Was Resident Evil 2 better than Mario Galaxy for me? Yes. Was Mario Galaxy

852
02:21:44,290 --> 02:22:00,430
better than Warcraft 3? Yeah. I think so. Was Undertale better than Warcraft 3? No. Was Shadow

853
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:13,739
the Colossus better than Undertale? Wait. I think I actually broke a controller with Shadow the

854
02:22:13,739 --> 02:22:20,559
Colossus. I think like the, I, the grip was, I couldn't grip. Like it was, I hated the control

855
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:37,100
scheme. And I think I literally like broke a controller in half. Like 15, 20 years ago. True.

856
02:22:37,100 --> 02:23:05,100
Is Metal Gear Solid better than Undertale? Yes. Is Metal Gear Solid better than Warcraft 3? Yes.

857
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:15,069
Is Metal Gear Solid better than Mario Galaxy? Yes. Is Metal Gear Solid better than Resident

858
02:23:15,069 --> 02:23:34,579
Evil 2? No. Is Resident Evil 2 better than Ocarina of Time? Is Ocarina of Time better than

859
02:23:34,579 --> 02:23:53,629
Minecraft? Is Metal Gear Solid better than Dark Souls 1? We have to go back and take,

860
02:23:53,629 --> 02:24:07,889
we have to go, we have to go back here. It is. Is Half-Life Alyx better than Portal 2?

861
02:24:10,059 --> 02:24:43,260
Yes. Is Portal 2 better than Minecraft? Is GTA 5 better than Ocarina of Time? GTA 5 better than

862
02:24:43,260 --> 02:25:02,989
Resident Evil 2? It's, no it is. Yes it is. Is it better than Minecraft? Yes it is. Is it better

863
02:25:02,989 --> 02:25:09,420
than Portal 2? No. Yes it is. Wait, isn't this, this is where it just was. Wasn't this just where

864
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:23,860
it was before? Is Resident Evil 4 better than World of Warcraft? No. That got knocked down.

865
02:25:24,579 --> 02:25:32,940
Is Half-Life Alyx better than World of Warcraft? Think, think really hard on this. No it's not.

866
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:37,620
It's not. I had so many wonderful memories in World of Warcraft back in like 2005.

867
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:49,200
This is, nothing will be able to cross this. This is not going up here, but nothing will cross that.

868
02:25:49,200 --> 02:26:10,129
Portal 2 better than Resident Evil 4? No. Is Resident Evil 4 better than GTA 5? Yes. I think

869
02:26:10,129 --> 02:26:28,690
so. It's so close. It's by like 0.01%. Alright. Team Fortress 2 or Diablo 2 or Bloodborne. Let's

870
02:26:28,690 --> 02:26:31,489
see. I think this, I think I'm done with this. Wait, is Undertale, it's Undertale better than

871
02:26:31,489 --> 02:26:38,610
Warcraft 3? Is Mario Galaxy better than Metal Gear Solid? Is Zelda better than Dark Souls?

872
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:51,520
Let's find out in this video. I feel like I'm making a fucking like top 10 list. Oh, I hate

873
02:26:51,520 --> 02:27:20,100
to do that, but I'm gonna. I'm done. This is, this is it. I really believe that Team Fortress 2

874
02:27:21,139 --> 02:27:28,430
is the best video game ever made. It's the best game ever made. It just is.

875
02:27:29,979 --> 02:27:38,459
Now, it might not be that supported right now, but holy shit, back in like 2010, 2011, 2012,

876
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:57,260
this is the best game ever made. Ever. Is Bloodborne better than D2 though?

877
02:27:58,459 --> 02:28:05,780
Yeah. Is D2 better than GTA 4? Yeah. Is Chrono Trigger better than Bloodborne? No. I think this

878
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:17,979
is accurate. 2013 was peak TF2. Nothing can come close. I have never cared about a video game more

879
02:28:17,979 --> 02:28:30,129
than I did TF2. 2010, 2011 to like 2015. Oh God, nothing will ever come close. If this is a barometer

880
02:28:30,129 --> 02:28:36,290
for where a video game has to cross to be better, like a best game ever made. Oh, you've, it's,

881
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:42,340
you've got a long way to go. So here's, look at, see these two. I find Bloodborne to be one of the

882
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:49,629
best games ever made. I do. This is not even close. If we're talking about a scale, okay, this is like

883
02:28:49,629 --> 02:28:56,079
the best game ever made for me. And this is like a second best game ever made. You're talking about

884
02:28:56,079 --> 02:29:05,840
like, like 50 points to go to cross from here to here. If TF2 is like a 100, Bloodborne's like a 60

885
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:11,299
and like everything else is underneath it. It's so impossible to cross that threshold.

886
02:29:11,299 --> 02:29:17,059
Somebody has to do something insane. TF2 is on its own tier. That's yeah. Now that's,

887
02:29:17,059 --> 02:29:29,979
that's accurate. I really, that's true. It belongs up there. It does. And literally everything else

888
02:29:30,059 --> 02:29:32,540
will never come close. Like maybe one day somebody will make something that is.

889
02:29:33,180 --> 02:29:38,159
Where's Stardew Valley? Cause that's like, that actually like belongs up here somewhere.

890
02:29:39,950 --> 02:29:51,299
Okay. So Stardew Valley is not on this list. Hay Day a Facebook game is. That's weird. Okay.

891
02:29:51,299 --> 02:29:55,219
Can I pretend this is Stardew Valley? Cause like Hay Day, like farming or something. All right.

892
02:29:55,219 --> 02:30:20,299
This is, this is Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley better than Resident Evil 4. I think so. Hay Day.

893
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:26,399
This is, I got 5,000 hours on Hay Day, man. I'm number one in my Facebook group.

894
02:30:26,959 --> 02:30:36,450
Now it's perfect. All right. There it is. There's, there's your video game. Tetris sucks. I hate

895
02:30:36,450 --> 02:30:44,319
that game. And that's it. That's going to be the stream. Um, so I've got to figure out,

896
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:53,680
I've got to figure out what this is. I can figure out what this means. I wonder,

897
02:30:53,680 --> 02:31:06,299
I wonder what he wants me to find. Grandpa. I will see you guys on Saturday. What are you

898
02:31:06,299 --> 02:31:12,700
going to do? Tetris stream? What about Slime Rancher? Uh, Slime Rancher is like up here

899
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:22,340
somewhere. No, it's not. It's like here. Where the fuck is Dark Souls 2? Do you really think

900
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:29,020
Dark Souls 2 should be on this list? I mean, it could be. It may be, but it would be down here.

901
02:31:34,989 --> 02:31:38,750
Oh, this, we'll do the same as one after the stream on Saturday at some point,

902
02:31:40,219 --> 02:31:45,809
some point. We'll see. I will see you guys on Saturday. That's the next time you're going to

903
02:31:45,809 --> 02:31:48,930
see me. I'm going to look directly at you because I'm telling you Saturday at 1 PM Pacific. I might

904
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:53,760
think about figuring out where that, what, what this is. I'm going to go explore. I'm just going

905
02:31:53,760 --> 02:32:02,290
to go explore now and just see if I can find anything. It might even be in the same damn close.

906
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:10,829
Yeah, we'll see you on Saturday. Uh, that's been the stream. Just wanted to hang out for a few

907
02:32:10,829 --> 02:32:14,270
hours and just say what's up and hang out with you guys. Uh, didn't I say, I said the stream was

908
02:32:14,270 --> 02:32:19,229
going to be 45 minutes, didn't I? Well, that was wrong. I've been here for like three and a half

909
02:32:19,229 --> 02:32:29,420
hours. Have a wonderful rest of your evening. Take care of yourselves. I'll see you guys on

910
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:41,739
Saturday at 1 PM Pacific. Look at how, look at that. Oh my goodness. That's so many subscriptions.

911
02:32:43,069 --> 02:32:48,780
Oh my God. Uh, but all in all, I hope that Saturday's fun.

912
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:56,379
It seems to be that there will be a lot of interesting things to do.

913
02:32:56,379 --> 02:33:12,659
We'll see. See you Saturday. Take care of yourselves. Archaeology. Wonders of archaeology.

914
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:20,139
Uh, raid? Uh, yeah. Who's, who's, let's see. Who's live right now? Or maybe we,

915
02:33:20,139 --> 02:33:32,379
maybe we picked somebody we've never raided before. Maybe. Let's see who's live. Uh,

916
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:46,590
hmm. Time for, time for networking Andy.

917
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:07,229
Or somebody we haven't raided. You know, we haven't, we've not raided, uh, critical in a long

918
02:34:07,229 --> 02:34:17,870
time. What are you doing? The big man is here. It's been a very long time. Go say hello to moist

919
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:31,010
critical. And no raid song, no raid song shit anymore. No more, no more raid songs. Charlie's

920
02:34:31,010 --> 02:34:35,100
going to look over and he's going to be like, what the fuck are you guys talking about? He's

921
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:38,780
going to be like, shut up. He's going to be like, what are you talking about? So many people have

922
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:42,059
no idea what you guys are talking about. And then I, and then I have to figure out how am I going

923
02:34:42,059 --> 02:34:50,100
to like cover for you guys. Oh, hey, uh, yeah. I mean, uh, we're just getting around. Uh, we're

924
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:57,579

925
02:34:57,579 --> 02:35:10,110

926
02:35:10,110 --> 02:35:23,389

929
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:54,670

930
02:35:54,670 --> 02:36:08,459
