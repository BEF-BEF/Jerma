1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,230
Sorry dude, I forgot to press the button that says to talk.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,500
No, I know. I can't even have two minutes. I can't even have two minutes to myself.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,989
Oh, I can't have two minutes to myself. I turn the stream on and I'm just sitting here,

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:27,399
just looking at Spongebob. This is our time. You had a whole day to yourself.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:37,990
You're ours now. His mic is wicked fucked up. I tried to fix it. I tried to make it louder.

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:50,380
Did I not succeed in making the mic louder? Am I loud now?

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,439
You had two months to yourself, Omega Lul.

8
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,060
And do that again. That's how you know I'm at 61%.

9
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,579
Oh, we shouldn't do that though. We have to take another fucking three months off.

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,810
That's your- that's how you prove it. That's how you tell people that you're feeling a little

11
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,379
better. It's the amount of times that you can- how many octaves and you can go up or down.

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:35,159
Fucking idiot. All right, we're gonna play Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated.

13
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,819
I was gonna play the original on the PS3, PS2, but months and months and months ago,

14
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:49,299
I was told, don't do that. They're making a new one. They're redoing the whole game. Just wait.

15
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:58,760
So I just waited and here it is. I've never played this. I'm a huge fan of Spongebob. I've seen

16
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,280
like the first 12 episodes and then I just stopped. I'm a huge fan. That's not even fucking true.

17
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:20,580
I think I've seen all the Spongebob episodes up until, I don't know, like maybe after the fourth,

18
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,289
sixth season? Season seven? How many actual new episodes- hit the thing about Spongebob

19
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,009
that's hard for me to understand. So does Spongebob keep having new episodes or do they keep

20
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:42,629
replaying old ones? Sometimes it's hard to tell. There's 13 seasons. Seasons one through three are

21
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,370
the good ones. Yeah, I know, but I can't- I'm not gonna lie to you. I've definitely laughed.

22
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,210
Like giggled at like probably like season eight, like episode 10, you know? I have.

23
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:02,419
Yeah, they made a movie too. All right, let me tweet this. Give me one second.

24
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:25,879
I'm just- hold on. Just on my Twitter. This is the first thing that's on my list.

25
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:35,189
Okay, this is- this is a render of me singing this song in the game. Why is this the first

26
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:55,979
thing in my feed? All right, well that was cool. All right, let me tweet this. This is freaking me

27
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:03,979
out. Why is it such- why is it so good? That's me doing that, but it's a render of me on another

28
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:11,719
character. Was I deepfaked onto a video game character? You can do that? You can be deepfaked

29
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,420
onto a new- a video game? I thought it had to be like a human face, like a photo or something,

30
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,439
or like an actual video of a person. Holy sh- all right, hit this star. Let me tweet this.

31
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,259
In the meantime, you guys can take a look at Spongebob doing the fucking gerbil walk.

32
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:42,490
That's what he's doing, right? All right, give me one second. Spongebob. People probably think

33
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,769
I'm watching Spongebob. What if I wrote, watching favorite Spongebob episodes? And then like,

34
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,990
he doesn't know. I'm gonna wake it fucked up mood today. This is gonna be a weird one.

35
00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:11,639
I can already tell. No, not Jerma975. Who the fuck is that? All right, can I- why would you make that

36
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:22,970
name? Are you gonna start a streaming career as like Jerma785? Like, I'm Jerma985. Are you gonna be

37
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:35,610
Jerma895? What do you think's gonna happen? I'm the only Jerma985. I'm the only Jerma with any

38
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:51,670
three series of numbers after his name. All right, let's go. Do we even have a controller? Yeah,

39
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:59,500
I do. So is this game any good? Is this actually like a fun game? Here's where I'm concerned. Is

40
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:10,410
this a Simpsons hit and run kind of game? No. Okay, well, let's check it out. I'm ready.

41
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,970
It's like its own episode.

42
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,259
I think he's gonna do it this time.

43
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,779
With my brand-new

44
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,980
I'm available.

45
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:05,189
One last review of the checklist. Let's see. Item number one is Plankton, a genius.

46
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:11,029
And sir, yes, okay checklist complete. Throwing the switch. I think that's just a game.

47
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:19,029
Welcome my perfectly obedient robot army. Hang on. I want to get a photo for my scrap.

48
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:23,269
What do you mean no? Hey, hello. What do you think you're doing?

49
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,579
I'm seeing that in real time too. Wait, I'm your manager.

50
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:50,600
That's not you seeing that on stream. I'm seeing that too. Another perfect day playing robots

51
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,360
and racehorses. Yeah, only I keep getting the racehorses and the robots mixed up.

52
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,860
Wait, do I have like the Spanish animation and the English dub? Do I have this wrong?

53
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,699
These unreal robots are getting boring. Hey, what if we put robots in here?

54
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,819
No, this is right. Oh, how shellfish of you.

55
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,860
I won't do it. I'm not gonna do it.

56
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,779
Great, Patrick. So we put the toy robots in here.

57
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:36,179
Yeah, it's fine. I didn't even do it. Why is everybody minus? I didn't do anything.

58
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,019
I told you I wasn't going to do it because I didn't want to offend everybody in this room.

59
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,580
It's quite a big room. Shut up. All right. Oh my god.

60
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,019
Patrick, are you going to say the magic wishing words?

61
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:54,460
You already did. Magic wishing word?

62
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:03,259
It used to be, but I kept forgetting it. Are you sure this will work?

63
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,700
Sure. Last week, I only had one big cookie crumb and I was really hungry. So I put my

64
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,299
cookie crumb in the magic wishing shell. Is this like Patrick accidentally makes meth?

65
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:24,139
What is this episode? Patrick, I proclaim that tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.

66
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,940
Good night, SpongeBob. Good night, Patrick.

67
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:29,820
The next melding.

68
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,649
Is this blood? The bikini bottom stinks.

69
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,460
Yeah, Gary. It sure looks like we're in a doozy of a pickle.

70
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,419
What in the world is going on? Did Patrick breathe in the shit in the shell and go in

71
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:11,350
like a drug craze and destroy the place? That is what happened. Is that actually what happened?

72
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,110
Why are people saying that's what happened? Yes, Jeremy, that's what happened.

73
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,330
That's not what happened. I think I can't just read this normally.

74
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,370
I can't. All right. Everybody fucking leave if you don't like it. Whatever. I don't care.

75
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:36,470
I think I'm going to have to learn a lot in order to fix this mess.

76
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,100
What a fantastic idea. Oh, he already read it.

77
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,299
These signs will provide important tips to help me out.

78
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,840
He already read it. Why did I read it after?

79
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,830
Why did I not process that he's the whole thing is voice acted? What am I stupid?

80
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:11,240
OK. How do I read the signs? Press this to read the signs.

81
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,159
Right bumper to read the signs. You got it.

82
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,509
So if I want to come back and talk to you again, just walk up to you and press this button.

83
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,789
I'd better get started now, Gary. I think that this is going to be a very long day.

84
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:31,940
OK, so you talk with Arby, explore the kitchen with all this stuff,

85
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,539
explore the bedroom and explore the attic. Explore the closet.

86
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:43,620
Pretty fluid. This actually looks really good.

87
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:54,409
This is really, really nice looking, isn't it? OK, let's explore.

88
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:01,659
We need 50 whatever those are. These are shiny objects.

89
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,700
Shiny objects are very valuable and may be traded to help SpongeBob a lot.

90
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,179
This is a currency. SpongeBob will need to collect as many shiny objects in order to complete his

91
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,659
quest to defeat the robot menace. There are five different hundred.

92
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,740
There are a hundred different community subs that just came in from Freddy Dredd.

93
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,059
Another of like added to the thousands that Freddy Dredd has given.

94
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,340
It's a fucking insane. Thank you for the hundred community stuff.

95
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:34,700
He's ready there. Thank you, Freddy. Jesus.

96
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,700
Ready again. Ready every day. Ready every moment.

97
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,429
I need to open up my like Twitch analytics and look at like total amount of money

98
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,389
contributions and just see, oh, here's the percent from Freddy.

99
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,629
It's like probably like it's probably like 13 percent by now, 20 percent.

100
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,779
Thank you, dude. Seriously.

101
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,090
Anyways, there are five colors. It's him.

102
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,389
Ready. Yeah, Freddy Dredd. I don't know who the fuck that is.

103
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,500
Hey, go look them up. There are five different colors.

104
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,580
Red, yellow, green, blue and purple. There are five different colors.

105
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:25,590
OK, red, yellow, green, camera TV. You know, I need to do it again.

106
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,549
Red is the most common and the least valuable.

107
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,669
Purple is the most rare and therefore the most valuable.

108
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,929
We'll value the shiny objects on her. OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:42,649
Oh, get over it. I was what? What's wrong?

110
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:43,929
You know, I can't do that.

111
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,700
And it even smells sweaty.

112
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,580
Just like I said, I said the words camera and TV.

113
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,779
All right. What? I can't say camera and TV in the same sentence.

114
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,139
But there's five things to remember.

115
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,240
I know from Mr. Krabs, it even smells sweaty.

116
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,919
That's gross. How the fuck does that happen?

117
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,279
Ahoy there, SpongeBob.

118
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:06,919
That's disgusting.

119
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:14,759
As a faithful crew member of the Krusty Krab, you've been promoted to head shiny object collector.

120
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,240
Yeah, that's a different actor.

121
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,759
Is it wasn't available?

122
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,389
That's right. A promotion.

123
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,909
So what this here new job entails is you collecting all these shiny objects.

124
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:34,629
He's probably leaving behind and bringing them to me.

125
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,830
Now, stop seahorsing around and get busy collecting.

126
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,019
That's right. No, I'm not going to try.

127
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,460
I need like another year to figure that out.

128
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,970
The robots of the area.

129
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,649
I love this. This is so fun.

130
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:57,690
I haven't done anything.

131
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,929
All right. So let me see the rarity.

132
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,529
Red, yellow, green, blue, purple.

133
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,129
Red is the most common.

134
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,509
Purple is the most valuable.

135
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,710
So that's what I'm looking for is purple.

136
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:17,029
You better do SpongeBob voices.

137
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,100
Do you really think you were going to come to the screen

138
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,860
and you're not going to hear at least four times?

139
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,539
It's already happened twice.

140
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,100
I don't know.

141
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,899
I thought that you said SpongeBob can see through walls.

142
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,419
SpongeBob, we see through walls.

143
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:32,059
I was like, wait, how is Hitman?

144
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,590
All right.

145
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,029
SpongeBob, I see how well he's doing.

146
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,230
But pressing RT, Zixie, a hundred community subs.

147
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,110
You guys, it took two fucking streams.

148
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,149
With like 3000 subs to get just jumped, dumped back on here.

149
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,110
I can't even fucking believe it.

150
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,190
Thank you. It's insane to me.

151
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,750
It's insane that you guys would even remotely

152
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,669
like have that many people come back and sub it

153
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:56,470
or community sub.

154
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,190
It's crazy.

155
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,990
I can't even believe it.

156
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,190
SpongeBob, we see how well he's doing by pressing RT.

157
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,909
Thank you, Zixie.

158
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:06,389
Seriously, so many people gave money last time.

159
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,549
I was just kind of overwhelmed and trying to ease back into it.

160
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,309
And if you don't know, I'm no longer doing bit readings.

161
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,230
It's a whole thing.

162
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,629
I'll go over it again later on.

163
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:17,990
We'll talk about it again if you don't know.

164
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,259
The upright is how many shiny objects you have.

165
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,299
Is it like a currency?

166
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:22,860
Don't say that.

167
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,220
That's an easy joke.

168
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,289
Golden spatulas.

169
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:29,769
Is this kind of like puzzle pieces in Banjo?

170
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,450
Like Stars in Mario?

171
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,500
Patrick's Lost Socks.

172
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,870
Here's an underwear SpongeBob has.

173
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,500
Cool. All right.

174
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,120
Okay.

175
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
I make myself a snack.

176
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,179
SpongeBob, there's snacks.

177
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:48,419
All right.

178
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,740
What's the last room I have to go into?

179
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,779
I need more shiny objects.

180
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh, I can put the camera in this bathroom.

181
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,240
The attic.

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,039
How do I get to the attic?

183
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,419
I'm blind.

184
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:02,740
Hold on.

185
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,180
I got to get all the shiny objects.

186
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,190
There's a double jump.

187
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,950
This game just became 10 times more cool.

188
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,799
I don't want to miss these.

189
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,650
This is a classic collectathon.

190
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,089
Oh, don't get me in this one.

191
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,869
I don't think I'll ever get out.

192
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,579
Wait, what is this?

193
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:28,700
Oh, whoa.

194
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,650
Oh, I see.

195
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:30,890
All right.

196
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,529
This is the bedroom.

197
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,670
I thought of.

198
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:36,309
All right.

199
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:36,869
Here's underwear.

200
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,069
How do I pick it up?

201
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,910
What is underwear health?

202
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,240
Can I open this?

203
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,640
It is.

204
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:49,960
Wow.

205
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:52,380
AA.

206
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,539
Double jump for extra height.

207
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,220
SpongeBob can only double jump once per jump.

208
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,680
Is there any?

209
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,720
I was going to call them crusties.

210
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,220
Oh, shit.

211
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,500
There's a lot of tutorials in here.

212
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,220
See how well SpongeBob is doing in every level of the game.

213
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,460
Press.

214
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,180
No, I got.

215
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,190
What the fuck, Xbox?

216
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,869
Like, what ever happened to the original start?

217
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,710
What's with the fucking menu button thing?

218
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,309
Like, I always forget where that is.

219
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,470
I always forget if it's selector start.

220
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,099
It's been the same thing for like 20, 30 straight years.

221
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,500
And you had to just put the weird like top left.

222
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,380
iPad friendly menu button.

223
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,500
That's on every website.

224
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,180
Like, just make it the start button.

225
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,579
Well, who?

226
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,220
Why change that?

227
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,700
I don't understand.

228
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,099
I don't get it.

229
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,740
I always forget if that's selector start.

230
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,900
When a level is selected, press A to view its details.

231
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,420
So, okay, you can see how much you've collected.

232
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,549
Yeah.

233
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,539
There's a hint on each golden spatula.

234
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,140
Hmm.

235
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,630
SpongeBob can take a taxi directly to the area of that spatula

236
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,069
from anywhere in the game.

237
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:04,549
Holy shit.

238
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,190
That's so good.

239
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,539
How many areas are in this game?

240
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,059
SpongeBob's.

241
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,259
Wait, did I just take a taxi to my closet?

242
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:25,500
Press Y when the ground, when on the ground,

243
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,940
and SpongeBob will do a bubble bash.

244
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:30,710
The bubble bash can smash tiki's or robots

245
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,869
or push buttons that are directly above SpongeBob.

246
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,549
When you see this icon, SpongeBob can stand on it

247
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,309
and do the bubble bash to break this directly above him.

248
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:40,789
Okay, cool.

249
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,109
I was going to say, what the hell does that mean?

250
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,160
I, I get a beach ball.

251
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, cool.

252
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,619
I haven't even played the game yet and it just happened fun.

253
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:53,180
This is fun.

254
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,019
Can I run on it?

255
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,890
I've got to believe I can run on it.

256
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:07,029
What do the tiki's do?

257
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,539
Just extra, uh, I got to think of something to call these

258
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,579
because I'll, I'll forget it every time.

259
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,329
Press B and he'll do a bubble bounce attack.

260
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:23,880
Okay, that's just like a grandpa.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,650
Yeah, B.

262
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:30,569
Rampoline.

263
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,140
Okay, cool.

264
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,990
So what does the attack button do?

265
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,869
Can I just catch stuff?

266
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:47,960
This is going to turn into like Luigi's Mansion

267
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,279
where I told you I couldn't play Luigi's Mansion 3 on stream.

268
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
You guys know why, right?

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,519
Oh, here's the bubble spin.

270
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay.

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,299
It was asking me why because I couldn't,

272
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,779
I had to suck up every single object in every room.

273
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,779
I just, I couldn't even play it.

274
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:08,740
I had to stop playing it.

275
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,339
I got to like the first little boss encounter

276
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,059
and it was like three or four hours had gone by

277
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,259
and I'm just like, I have to stop this.

278
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,059
I have to stop playing this.

279
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,099
It's driving me crazy.

280
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,500
Oh, let me see.

281
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,440
Okay, right.

282
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, you can push buttons on walls.

283
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,680
Why was I pretending that I, that was new information?

284
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,720
Okay, you can jump, do an emitter.

285
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,400
All right, cool.

286
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,430
But yeah, if I have to just collect every single item.

287
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,430
Wait, now I, oh man, this is not going to,

288
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,470
this is not going to go well.

289
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,230
I'm going to be stuck here for the life.

290
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:57,829
Shit.

291
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,269
Okay, I got to get that dirty sock.

292
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,660
Give me that beach ball.

293
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:17,609
Hey, what the hell was that?

294
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,569
I need to get that.

295
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,420
Wait, can I just push it?

296
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:29,190
Why am I trying to?

297
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,009
Oh, here comes some hustle platforming.

298
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,019
25 seconds left.

299
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,299
23 seconds left.

300
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,900
22, 21.

301
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,180
No, do they get a head start?

302
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,069
What the fuck?

303
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:58,900
I thought I was looking at, yeah.

304
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,579
I hate that I wasn't going to get there.

305
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,500
And that's one dirty sock.

306
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,140
Room complete.

307
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:17,539
Yeah, you can take a 10 second head start.

308
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,339
That's fine.

309
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:24,660
All right, now it's 50 to go in there.

310
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,380
I have 50, right?

311
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,619
Yeah.

312
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,180
All right, let's go.

313
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,140
This room is expensive.

314
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,640
Ooh, there's a golden spatula.

315
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:38,490
What about the legendary chest?

316
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,369
Hold on.

317
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,130
This is a golden spatula.

318
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,930
They're needed to unlock new areas of Bikini Bottom.

319
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,329
SpongeBob will need to collect many golden spatulas.

320
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:48,119
Okay.

321
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:56,069
Ooh, go back and look at the chest somebody said.

322
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,750
Maybe a little bounce on the old bed.

323
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,150
Read the sign next to the chest.

324
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,630
Wait, what?

325
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,819
This is underwear.

326
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,900
To lose a pair of underwear every time he gets hit by a robot or touches dangerous objects.

327
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,380
Like this.

328
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,440
When he's lost all of his underwear, he must start that area back over again.

329
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:16,660
Yes.

330
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,220
SpongeBob may get back underwear he has lost by collecting additional pairs along the way.

331
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,259
SpongeBob starts out wearing three pairs of underwear,

332
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:29,299
but there are special pairs of golden underwear hidden in Bikini Bottom.

333
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,859
Which if you find them, they'll allow SpongeBob to wear more than three pairs of underwear at a time.

334
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,460
Ugh.

335
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,410
SpongeBob can check how many pairs of underwear he has on.

336
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,170
Pressing right trigger.

337
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,980
SpongeBob has no underwear on.

338
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,880
All right, let's go.

339
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
I got the spatula.

340
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,359
Look, I'm not looking for 100%.

341
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,119
I'm just looking for like somewhere around 80.

342
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:01,799
TV.

343
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,069
Quietly.

344
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:14,569
Yeah.

345
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,680
Oh no.

346
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,339
I'm in big trouble.

347
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,299
This is a plus two game.

348
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:51,059
Yeah, it's SpongeBob.

349
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,019
There's nothing like the sounds of your own neighborhood.

350
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,569
Oh shit.

351
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:57,210
Open world.

352
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,250
Go away, SpongeBob.

353
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,930
You're polluting my thinking space.

354
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,730
Trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula again, eh, Plankton?

355
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,170
Well, you won't get away with it.

356
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,190
I've got bigger fish to fry.

357
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,109
I've got to figure out how to regain control of the chum bucket from those robots.

358
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,490
Crush him.

359
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,140
Not for me, though.

360
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,339
That's for sure.

361
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:26,619
They just showed up out of nowhere and started calling me rude names

362
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,660
and throwing things.

363
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,339
They even bent all my spoons.

364
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,859
I love those spoons like they were my children.

365
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,700
He's a liar.

366
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,180
He did it.

367
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,980
That's terrible.

368
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,700
It was him.

369
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,339
I know it.

370
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,420
It's him in every episode.

371
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,059
Oh, won't you help me stop them before they bend all my forks?

372
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:53,509
But wait, I'm supposed to collect a whole lot of golden spatulas.

373
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,069
Golden spatulas, SpongeBob?

374
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:58,390
That sounds like something I'd be interested in.

375
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,630
Golden spatulas, eh?

376
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:04,150
SpongeBob, if you could get me back into the chum bucket,

377
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,230
I'll give you a bucket full of golden spatulas in your dreams.

378
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,930
You've got a deal.

379
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,710
Stop it!

380
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,490
Oh, god, that was fucking so funny, Jerma.

381
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,930
I laughed wicked fucking hard.

382
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,009
I love opening presents.

383
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:27,529
All right, so taxi.

384
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,690
So let's, can I just go anywhere?

385
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:34,279
Any five to go this way.

386
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,740
Need more golden spatulas to unlock downtown Bikini Bottom.

387
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:48,539
All right, should I just do what happens in every SpongeBob episode?

388
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,799
Like throw rocks at Squidward's house?

389
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,329
Where are they?

390
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:02,809
SpongeBob, this flapping robot crisis is making

391
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,970
the Krusty Krab lose money like a sinking ship.

392
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,930
No money means no more Krusty Krab.

393
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,769
No more Krusty Krab means no more fry cooking for you.

394
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,210
It's imitation crabs.

395
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,250
Imitation crab.

396
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,450
Ah, that was pretty good.

397
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,210
That was pretty good.

398
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,619
But because you're gullible, I'm going to help you out.

399
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,539
And of course, make a small profit in return.

400
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,700
I've got a few golden spatulas that I'll be willing to trade to you

401
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,299
for some of those shiny objects.

402
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,500
But because you're gullible, I'm going to help you out, boy.

403
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,259
And of course, make a small profit.

404
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,740
It's, his voice is un, you can't mimic it.

405
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,240
You can't.

406
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,519
Alex Jones.

407
00:28:49,319 --> 00:29:01,109
I got a few golden spatulas that will be willing to trade you

408
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,549
for some of those shiny objects and...

409
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,000
Ah, Spongebob, I just, where's the problem?

410
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,799
The problem is you just...

411
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,039
I'm not getting any more money on this,

412
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,559
and I got to make money to make money, you know what I mean?

413
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:22,250
I mean, but don't you think that Alex Jones

414
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,609
would be able to do a better Mr. Krabs?

415
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,089
Like if it was just Alex Jones talking,

416
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,210
it would be closer, wouldn't it?

417
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:34,299
Hey, Spongebob, I just dropped by to give you a bubble hand.

418
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:34,799
No.

419
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,109
If Alex Jones, yes, somebody said it.

420
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:45,589
If Alex Jones did his best pirate impression,

421
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,170
it might be kind of close.

422
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:48,809
It could be.

423
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,980
Wait, what you've never heard, Alex Jones, is Mr. Krabs impression?

424
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,700
Neither have I.

425
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,380
You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves

426
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,619
if you're going to journey to the ninth dimension

427
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,779
and defeat the giant monkey man.

428
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:12,329
You see, you're going to need to learn some new bubble blowing moves.

429
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,890
But, uh, all I need to do is figure out how to get rid of these robots.

430
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:19,769
You really want...

431
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,960
Oh, what the fuck?

432
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,599
I'm, all right, now you're throwing me off.

433
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,420
Oh, yeah, sorry.

434
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,220
I've been in the soap bottle a little too long.

435
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:43,660
Where were we?

436
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:48,299
That's something about new bubble moves.

437
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,259
I'm not on crack.

438
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:51,750
All right.

439
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,109
Right.

440
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:54,069
Press this button.

441
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:56,950
I'm on a different, I'm on a different drug.

442
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,990
That defeats anything that is directly above you.

443
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,710
Try it out.

444
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,990
I already know.

445
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,150
The sign told me this already.

446
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,180
It shines.

447
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,950
Mega combo?

448
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,829
Wait, why is this attacking me?

449
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:17,859
It's on absent.

450
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,019
Don't forget to defeat robots or tiggies that are directly above you.

451
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:22,980
Press this button.

452
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:24,339
Did I try this one?

453
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:26,539
No.

454
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:32,359
What about the robot parts?

455
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,000
Anything with those?

456
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:47,619
Hey, hey.

457
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:57,430
Oh, that just, okay, that freaked me the fuck out.

458
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,539
That was so out of place that I thought something was wrong.

459
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,140
I don't know why.

460
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,940
That was so out of place that I felt like somebody was in the room with me here

461
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,299
and did that from behind the monitor.

462
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:18,549
All right, so where do I go?

463
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:19,589
Where should I go?

464
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,869
Should I go to Squidward's house?

465
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,490
Ooh, golden undies.

466
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:37,500
Shit, what did that do?

467
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:41,140
How do I get there?

468
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,380
On this side?

469
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,119
Wait, no.

470
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,480
Hurry up.

471
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:05,910
Oh, got one.

472
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:08,220
Two spatulas.

473
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,339
All right, so I need five to go that way.

474
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:17,900
So let's go to, let's go to Squidward's house.

475
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Those stupid robots ruined a perfectly relaxing mud bath this morning.

476
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,920
And now you show up.

477
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,400
Can my day get any more dreary?

478
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,839
Yeah, let's like annoy Squidward.

479
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,380
I am so sorry, Squidward.

480
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,460
Patrick and I were just playing a game and-

481
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,160
I correct myself.

482
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,839
Oh, I correct myself.

483
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,119
That whole robot problem involved both of you.

484
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,240
This whole stream is going to be that.

485
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,160
And I'm sorry, there's like 8,000 people here.

486
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,480
And I think a lot of you might not have been to the stream maybe before.

487
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,400
That's what this is.

488
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,119
That's the whole thing.

489
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,279
I don't know either.

490
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,400
I know what you just said out loud.

491
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,759
I don't know how I got here either.

492
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,200
I don't.

493
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:06,380
Let's move on.

494
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:13,300
Squidward, I don't know what to do.

495
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,219
How can I fix everything?

496
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,400
One picture on the wall.

497
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,980
That should help out more than enough to another town.

498
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,610
Guys, what are you talking about?

499
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,250
That's just every iPhone selfie when you turn the forward-facing camera to you.

500
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:37,610
I didn't know Squidward had a lamp.

501
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:43,019
Let's get all this stuff.

502
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,940
Old joke.

503
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,380
No, old joke is fine.

504
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,179
I didn't know-

505
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:50,739
I'm lucky.

506
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,460
Okay, okay, okay.

507
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,139
Just stop jumping, will you?

508
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,940
If you take this golden spatula, will you please go away?

509
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,579
Wait, I get it.

510
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,300
See, Squidward?

511
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,139
I knew that you could help me out.

512
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:04,099
You're the best.

513
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,420
Don't touch me.

514
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:07,619
Wait, he's gonna-

515
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,139
I just came in here and-

516
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:12,900
This is like mob protection money.

517
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,780
I just came in here and trashed all of his stuff to get the currency.

518
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,699
That's wicked fucked up.

519
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:30,860
All right, can I-

520
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,820
The Squidward or what?

521
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,030
His name's not Squidward.

522
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,070
It's Squidward.

523
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,949
He only has one room?

524
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,309
I thought he has a bathtub upstairs.

525
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,269
He can't go in his upstairs bathtub thing?

526
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,289
Go kill the painting.

527
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,750
Come on.

528
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,230
What?

529
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,789
What do you mean?

530
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,510
Break all this stuff.

531
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,909
I did.

532
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:52,710
Didn't I break it all?

533
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,510
I didn't know Squidward had a lamp.

534
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:00,539
Oh, he turns into-

535
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,059
Squaliam.

536
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,409
Oh, Jerma pretends to like this show.

537
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:06,730
Does he?

538
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:10,539
How would I have fucking known that?

539
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,619
Hey, Patrick.

540
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,579
What sock?

541
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:30,059
Oh, right.

542
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:30,860
What are the socks for?

543
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,059
The one you're standing on.

544
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:33,900
Oh, that one.

545
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:35,659
It's lost.

546
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,739
Well, if that one's lost, where are your other socks?

547
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,980
Well, they're more lost.

548
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,059
A bunch of robots came through here and stole my whole sock collection.

549
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:48,380
I could use some help getting them back.

550
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,019
What do I get?

551
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:49,659
Sure thing, Patrick.

552
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,340
What are best friends for?

553
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,380
Okay, then.

554
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,179
For every 10 socks you bring back to me,

555
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,380
I'll give you a golden turkey baster.

556
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,659
You mean spatula?

557
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:01,260
Bless you.

558
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,969
Oh, so this is the red coins of SpongeBob.

559
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:14,389
Living under a rock.

560
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,110
Does he have anything?

561
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,070
And that's the life.

562
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:19,940
Love opening presents.

563
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,980
Too pretty.

564
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,179
Holy shit, SpongeBob.

565
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:22,500
Really?

566
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:24,860
Are you going to first of all-

567
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,460
Are you going to break into your buddy's house

568
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,699
who owns a sofa and not even a carpet or anything?

569
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,980
And that's what you're going to do?

570
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,619
You take his stuff?

571
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,380
This?

572
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,699
Wait.

573
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,510
Oh, man.

574
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,190
And I'm going to destroy his sofa.

575
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,590
That's good.

576
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,889
You're the one controlling him.

577
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,420
So?

578
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:57,050
What?

579
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,409
Why is everybody freaking out about that?

580
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,530
That's part of the video game.

581
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,590
All right, so I have-

582
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,469
How many do I have?

583
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:03,670
I need two more.

584
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:07,719
Okay, let's go this way.

585
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,469
Let's do some platforming.

586
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:16,070
What?

587
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,110
Am I getting invisible wall?

588
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,010
Shit, I am getting-

589
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,969
I'm getting invisible wall.

590
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:21,449
That's-

591
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,250
What the heck?

592
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:31,030
I have 240 of these.

593
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:36,139
All right, so go to jellyfish fields.

594
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:40,230
Okay, I'll go to jellyfish fields.

595
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,750
Is there a dash or a run?

596
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,860
Or am I already running?

597
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,780
Hey, I can't.

598
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,829
You can't walk there.

599
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,349
You have to go through the taxi thing.

600
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,550
Oh, this is where we get to start.

601
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,590
Jellyfish fields.

602
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,309
A place to experience nature at its most raw.

603
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,429
I can't walk there?

604
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,989
And sometimes a bit tender from the stings.

605
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:30,250
Horrible scream.

606
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:39,960
That's the kind of scream that I feel like Squidward

607
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,800
was lying on like the medieval stretcher.

608
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,110
That was fucking nuts.

609
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:51,829
Squidward, are you okay?

610
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,710
Hey, you barnacle.

611
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,869
I mean, bigger than usual because it's usually pretty-

612
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:01,909
I mean, that thing's gigantic.

613
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:02,949
And you look clammy and-

614
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:04,820
I mean, Santa.

615
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,179
That's my favorite thing.

616
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,300
That's my favorite line.

617
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:11,670
When Squidward's pretending to be Santa Claus

618
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,550
and SpongeBob keeps talking about how big his nose is,

619
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,349
it's like just-

620
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:16,710
It's total cartoon comedy.

621
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:22,340
Always been bald, but now I'm stung all over.

622
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,219
Well, according to the jellyfisher field manual,

623
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,940
severe jellyfish stings can be treated effectively

624
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,300
by applying a thick layer of king jellyfish jelly

625
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,420
to the affected areas.

626
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,579
King j-j-j-jellyfish!

627
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:38,900
I'm not bald?

628
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,099
Yeah, neither am I.

629
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:41,940
Good, we got something in common, you and I.

630
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:43,460
Well, I guess you're on the scale-

631
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,260
We gotta go kill the king jellyfish?

632
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,230
...sport mountain and die off the vicious tentacles

633
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,429
of king jellyfish.

634
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:56,699
I'll stay here, bald up here in excruciating pain.

635
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:57,739
You do that!

636
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,099
Don't worry, Squidward.

637
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,340
I'll bring back that king jellyfish jelly

638
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,940
for you to rub all over yourself.

639
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:06,710
Real voice.

640
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:09,670
He's just pretending the whole time.

641
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,110
All right, let's go.

642
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:12,789
What did I do that for?

643
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:16,469
I didn't get every single crusties.

644
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:17,670
All right, that's okay.

645
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,710
I'm gonna have to call them crusties.

646
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,630
That's how I can't call them anything else.

647
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,690
Ooh, what's this?

648
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,900
Can I catch the jellyfish?

649
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,460
Like, what does it do?

650
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,960
Nothing.

651
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,500
This is goo.

652
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:34,300
SpongeBob and Patrick can't swim,

653
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,820
so don't let them fall in the goo.

654
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:48,420
So how much currency is a lot?

655
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,219
This is a teleport box.

656
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:53,130
When you have both of the teleport boxes

657
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:53,929
in the area open,

658
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,929
you may teleport between them by jumping inside.

659
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:00,139
I don't have both, I don't think.

660
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:03,369
I think I have to touch both, probably.

661
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:05,460
Yeah.

662
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,019
All right, let's go.

663
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,619
Collect everything.

664
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:10,500
Do I have full underwear?

665
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,420
Just said that.

666
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,690
Yeah, I'm just processing information.

667
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:23,960
You have your way to process info, and I have mine.

668
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Mine happens to be I say something out loud

669
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,000
and then go over it.

670
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,039
I know, I already know what it is.

671
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,150
I have to just activate my audio processor.

672
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,690
Ow, that hurt.

673
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,719
Does it want to kill him?

674
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,199
All right, I don't want to die in SpongeBob

675
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,320
Battle for Bikini Bottom.

676
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,900
Hold on, does this bounce?

677
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,039
Wow.

678
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,219
All right, that's fun.

679
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,440
Yeah.

680
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:04,139
Wait, I probably can get pretty far from there.

681
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:04,639
Hold on.

682
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,460
This is great.

683
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,519
This is fun.

684
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,400
I like this game.

685
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,889
Am I allowed to say this is better than Mario Odyssey?

686
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,409
Fuck.

687
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:29,550
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,630
It's not, okay?

689
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:40,150
It's not.

690
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,349
It's called a joke.

691
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,309
I, that Mario Odyssey's fan.

692
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:45,110
Oh, fuck.

693
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:45,909
What am I supposed to do?

694
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:46,630
I can't go back.

695
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm not supposed to step on the gas.

696
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,860
It was 125.

697
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:06,010
Oh, checkpoint.

698
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,809
Step on the gas.

699
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:07,769
Step on the brakes.

700
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,260
Step on the gas.

701
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,139
Step on the brake.

702
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,980
Now step on the, well, you're saying it wrong.

703
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,739
It's, step gas, step on brake, step on, step on, step gas.

704
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,059
I would have understood what you were talking about

705
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:19,860
if you said it that way.

706
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,489
Wait, I don't want to go over there yet.

707
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:34,469
Okay, where do I want to go?

708
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,309
There are green shamrocks over there.

709
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,579
I want them.

710
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,119
I got to check, I'll get his underwear over there.

711
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:43,750
That's a secret.

712
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:45,539
Yeah, but I know.

713
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:50,599
Look, I'm, hey, you play your Super Mario Odyssey games

714
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,360
the way you play, the way you like,

715
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,519
and I play my Super Mario Odyssey games

716
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,320
the way that I like.

717
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:03,340
Holy shit.

718
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:03,900
Look at this.

719
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,230
Am I going to die if I go down here?

720
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,369
This is goo, right?

721
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,980
Can I land on it, though?

722
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,940
What if I just land on it?

723
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,539
If I land on it, does it, okay, I have a question.

724
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,179
So if I touch this, does it go like,

725
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:30,230
and we get a silhouette close around the character?

726
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,969
Yeah, and then we go back to the beginning.

727
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:45,449
I didn't touch it.

728
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:45,949
How?

729
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:53,860
Is there a penalty for losing?

730
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:03,150
What?

731
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,710
There's no way I didn't touch that.

732
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,449
I don't know how that's, I touched it.

733
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:12,090
I touched it.

734
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,500
I slow that down.

735
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:22,840
I can't touch it.

736
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,119
You don't get it this way.

737
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,599
You can't get it that way.

738
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:29,900
Well, look, there's no penalty for dying.

739
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,699
As a whole joke.

740
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:33,980
No, I'm touching it.

741
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:39,210
You're wasting underwear.

742
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,360
What do you mean wasting underwear?

743
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,119
Does SpongeBob piss his pants or shit his pants every time he fucking dies?

744
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:46,679
Wow.

745
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,079
Shit.

746
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:47,800
Yeah, you do.

747
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,280
Okay.

748
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,920
That makes sense.

749
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,420
Never mind.

750
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,219
Yeah, I forgot.

751
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,179
What does that happen to you?

752
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:02,940
Everybody.

753
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,690
The question I should be asking is why does he come back to life?

754
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:13,429
That's plain.

755
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,269
All right.

756
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:16,150
How do I get that sock?

757
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,780
Hmm.

758
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,579
I'm going to use the bracelet.

759
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,739
It's a video game.

760
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:29,739
Yeah, I, what?

761
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:31,019
I was just talking.

762
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:31,519
Okay.

763
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,059
If you are defeated after activating a checkpoint,

764
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,300
you restart at the checkpoint instead of at the beginning of the area.

765
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:42,440
So how do I get this?

766
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,940
It shines.

767
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,940
Oh, is it like a floating thing I can use eventually?

768
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:52,420
Doctor.

769
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,619
He thinks he's screaming again.

770
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:58,679
Yes, he does.

771
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:00,730
He does.

772
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,090
Because he is.

773
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:05,860
Tell the story.

774
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm just going to thousand of these things.

775
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,260
Whoops.

776
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:17,760
What was that?

777
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:19,760
Fear?

778
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,420
This is a freezing fruit.

779
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:24,380
Only Patrick can use the freezing fruit.

780
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:26,039
Why?

781
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:32,630
I can't have like a nice ice cold fucking draft beer.

782
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:38,269
Ah.

783
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:40,329
SpongeBob not old enough.

784
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,159
Minus two.

785
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,250
Oh, I missed this.

786
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,210
I missed this.

787
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,809
This is like my favorite thing on earth.

788
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,329
I'm so glad I'm here again.

789
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:00,010
I missed this shit so much.

790
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,639
Ultra combo.

791
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:10,219
I think I needed those.

792
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:19,210
Can I make this?

793
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:24,409
What's this do?

794
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,460
It's going to be timed, isn't it?

795
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,199
Well, what is it?

796
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:28,699
A big one?

797
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,909
Whoa, what the?

798
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:36,869
Hey, what?

799
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:42,579
This dude's addicted to streaming.

800
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,179
I thought I had it.

801
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:47,460
Apparently not.

802
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:50,329
Half life.

803
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:54,460
It is.

804
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:56,869
It is half life.

805
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:10,570
All right.

806
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,050
You need to do it.

807
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:12,940
Okay.

808
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,019
It's kind of hard because usually you just watch the shadow in these 3D platformers.

809
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:19,739
Kind of hot.

810
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:20,380
Ooh, purple.

811
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,179
What's how much purple?

812
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,179
842.

813
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,019
8.

814
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:25,500
Okay.

815
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,380
872.

816
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:28,219
892.

817
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:29,659
Oh, that's like a Sonic the Hedgehog thing.

818
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:36,579
Oh, all right.

819
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:37,380
That was a thousand.

820
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:49,829
Bro, please watch the shadows.

821
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:59,380
And do you guys remember when Mario Odyssey came out with the two player mode?

822
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,739
That was not even a two player mode.

823
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:02,739
It was just like a like a holy shit.

824
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:04,579
Like your little brother gets to at least do something.

825
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:14,630
I stopped talking shit about Mario.

826
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,590
Like what am I doing?

827
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,349
What am I thinking?

828
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:18,150
What's wrong with me?

829
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,500
I love that franchise.

830
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,219
Like what am I doing?

831
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:31,719
I feel like a new sponge.

832
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,320
He's breaking his conditioning.

833
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,750
Hey, Gary.

834
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,789
What's shaking?

835
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:45,349
Hey, Gary.

836
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:47,030
Was someone shooting the cannonballs?

837
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:54,550
He won.

838
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,719
Wow.

839
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:56,360
Don't touch that.

840
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:07,239
A bungee jump for a guttula.

841
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,119
Hang jellyfish.

842
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:09,320
Oh, that's the first boss.

843
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,420
But I want to see what this does.

844
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,250
This is a bungee jump.

845
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,929
SpongeBob can bungee from it.

846
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,690
Bungee from the bungee hook.

847
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,809
Just jump up and touch it.

848
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:22,489
Dive, press A.

849
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,650
To exit the hook, press B.

850
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:34,789
Oh, that's how you do it.

851
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,300
Got it.

852
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,019
That's how you get it.

853
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:40,659
Okay, cool.

854
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:45,269
Nice.

855
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:46,230
All right, that's how you do it.

856
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,989
Let's go kill King Jellyfish.

857
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,030
Get four.

858
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:05,670
I promise.

859
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:08,230
I know there's a lot of people probably waiting for me to do

860
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,869
like the Quentin Central classic.

861
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:12,869
Dive when you move your finger up and down your throat.

862
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:16,340
It's going to be crazed.

863
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,219
I'm going to do it at one point.

864
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:18,099
I'm not going to tell you when.

865
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,500
But that's the only reason why you're here.

866
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:24,460
It's going to happen fucking crazed at one point.

867
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,659
I don't know.

868
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:26,860
It could happen like four hours.

869
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,500
I have no idea.

870
00:53:30,789 --> 00:53:32,789
Just my size.

871
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:34,949
You've just met the Sponginator.

872
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:47,909
Hey, are you guys minus doing SpongeBob?

873
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,829
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

874
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:04,380
Hey, what?

875
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,099
Can I reverse it?

876
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:14,789
I just, how do I talk?

877
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:28,139
I need underwear.

878
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,340
If I'm going to fight King Jellyfish,

879
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,300
how the hell am I going to do this?

880
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:38,199
I'm going to wait until after he swings down the hand.

881
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:48,619
You know how, you know when there's a game mechanic

882
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,260
that is just stuck in your brain forever

883
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,139
and you'll never get rid of it.

884
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,860
I was just thinking to myself,

885
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,460
like, oh, I wish there was like a dodge roll.

886
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:59,739
It doesn't have to be in every single game.

887
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:01,340
But it kind of does now, doesn't it?

888
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:07,480
FromSoftware has ruined all video games.

889
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:17,380
Because if there's not like a, like what have they done?

890
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:36,860
Oh, no.

891
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,420
What?

892
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,969
I thought I could get the edge.

893
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:41,530
Okay.

894
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,360
Friends of Persia did it first?

895
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:51,940
Yeah, when I'm talking about who did it first,

896
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,219
I'm talking about who did it best.

897
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,400
Yeah, back in like the fucking 1700s,

898
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,599
a guy made up toothpaste.

899
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:04,199
He was brushing his teeth with like cream.

900
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,300
He did it first.

901
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:11,369
It wasn't until fucking Dave Colgate came along.

902
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,719
He did it best.

903
00:56:24,699 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah, the guy that made the toothbrush is cool

904
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,980
when the guy that was brushing his teeth was sand.

905
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,420
You're a corporate shill.

906
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:47,659
A corporate shill.

907
00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:51,420
Okay.

908
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:51,820
All right.

909
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,139
All right.

910
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:52,699
You ready?

911
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:53,019
Ready?

912
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:53,980
Three, two, one.

913
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,900
Name any other brand of toothpaste right now.

914
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,539
Go.

915
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,619
Name a single brand of toothpaste that's not Colgate.

916
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:58,860
Go.

917
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:02,150
Fuck.

918
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,469
Crest.

919
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:02,789
All right.

920
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:03,510
Not Crest.

921
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,869
Something else is not Crest.

922
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,800
This is like three, okay?

923
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:10,280
There's like one.

924
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,559
There's two on Earth.

925
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:16,570
Oral-B.

926
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,250
Oh, but that's only if you want to brush like a dentist.

927
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:20,750
Fuck.

928
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,440
Aquafresh?

929
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:28,920
Aquafresh?

930
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,880
Yeah, Aquafresh.

931
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,840
Why can I not say this word?

932
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,599
Aquafresh is the best by far.

933
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:34,579
Without a doubt in my mind.

934
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,619
Like everybody just buys Colgate and Crest.

935
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:38,340
Like what the fuck?

936
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,380
It's just the easiest thing to get.

937
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,260
But Aquafresh.

938
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,900
Holy shit.

939
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,099
Especially that like orange like shower cream like one.

940
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,139
You know what I'm talking about?

941
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:46,820
The one that said it was a shower for your mouth.

942
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,780
It was like an ad campaign.

943
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,139
It was just marketing bullshit.

944
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:50,179
That was the best one by far.

945
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:51,940
It was the orange.

946
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,539
It had the orange line.

947
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:57,460
It was the Aquafresh like shower for your mouth clean.

948
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,579
It was the best one.

949
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:07,699
Show the ad.

950
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:11,559
I don't think there was an ad.

951
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,420
Show the ad.

952
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,139
I don't think it.

953
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:22,179
I don't think they just.

954
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,699
The ad was just it was on the shelf.

955
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:24,420
And that's what they said.

956
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:33,659
Let's see.

957
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:37,099
Aquafresh shower for your mouth.

958
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,219
What the fuck?

959
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:49,940
There's this.

960
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,980
Wait a minute.

961
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,539
The first thing that pops up is a shower for your mouth.

962
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:59,269
What is this thing?

963
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,280
Can we go over?

964
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,880
Can we examine this for just a minute?

965
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,429
Okay.

966
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:09,989
What is this?

967
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,579
I don't want to put that image up.

968
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:23,900
Okay.

969
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,340
It's this one.

970
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:25,820
What is this?

971
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,260
Do you put your mouth up around the edges of that and just turn it on?

972
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,820
How does this work?

973
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,639
I like it.

974
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,920
I'm intrigued by this.

975
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,360
This actually is.

976
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,960
I kind of want to see how this works.

977
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,150
Do you like wrapping your mouth around?

978
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,829
It's the hose.

979
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:50,260
So wait, you put.

980
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:50,500
Okay.

981
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,300
So hold on a minute.

982
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,940
This is it.

983
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,659
I love this.

984
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,179
I don't know why.

985
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:54,820
I like this.

986
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,900
So the red cap is like the toothpaste or something.

987
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,420
And then you like you turn the hose on with this in your mouth and you just like.

988
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:13,079
It does not go.

989
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:15,719
No, it does not go.

990
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,320
I'm not even going to say it.

991
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,900
It's as seen on TV.

992
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,050
It's a water flosser for your shower head.

993
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,420
I think I want this.

994
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:35,110
Do you know how hard it is to floss every day?

995
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,630
Imagine you can just like put a tube in your mouth and just turn the water on full blast.

996
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,250
Does this work?

997
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,369
It's got four stars.

998
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,409
I'm not even fucking around with you right now.

999
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:48,489
This is the this has four stars on Amazon with like 2000 fucking reviews.

1000
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:49,690
This thing is probably cool.

1001
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,219
I got to look into this after the stream.

1002
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,699
All right, let's go.

1003
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:16,420
You guys are so fucked up and I'm the fucking weird guy, right?

1004
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:16,980
That's the thing.

1005
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:18,420
I'm the weird guy.

1006
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:25,559
This is very dangerous for just one health pack.

1007
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:36,570
Oh, yeah.

1008
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,170
Try this new water flosser.

1009
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:40,820
It goes.

1010
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:46,219
I can't say it.

1011
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,500
I can't even.

1012
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,059
I can't do it.

1013
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:57,989
You connect it to your bidet and do put it in.

1014
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:01,190
But all right, I'm moving on.

1015
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,789
And what you as you're on the toilet, you put it in the

1016
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,469
and then what spit down between your legs into the toilet.

1017
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,260
Yeah, I got.

1018
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:20,889
Oh, I got the teleport that machine huffing and puffing over.

1019
01:02:20,889 --> 01:02:24,250
There is a duplicate duplicate OTRON.

1020
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:28,010
I'm going to call it the duplicator, duplicator, the duplicator.

1021
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:32,860
I'll call the D 1000 that will continue to create robots until it's destroyed.

1022
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:35,190
Be careful, though.

1023
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,269
It goes out with a big bang.

1024
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,639
Oh, you can.

1025
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:46,570
That's cool.

1026
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,460
All right, we got to kill this thing.

1027
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,489
That was a big bang, wasn't it?

1028
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,320
All right.

1029
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,280
Well, there's a button.

1030
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,250
Coked out streamer flosses his teeth in the bidet.

1031
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:10,650
All right.

1032
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,449
All right.

1033
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:18,409
You know, as well as I do, that there is there is a 90s comedy or an early 2000s comedy

1034
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:23,369
where like Will Ferrell has to really get something out of his mouth and rinse his mouth.

1035
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:27,530
And oh, what's this up a day?

1036
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:31,289
And he leans down like fucking cartoon three stooges style

1037
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:33,769
and turns it on and starts like rinsing his mouth out and like

1038
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:35,610
spitting into the toilet with a bidet.

1039
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,650
You know, it existed.

1040
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,849
It's in a movie somewhere.

1041
01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:40,250
I don't know which one and I don't know when, but it happened.

1042
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,409
Let me look it up.

1043
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:54,059
Nobody look up.

1044
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:56,139
Will Ferrell rinses mouth with a bidet.

1045
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:13,909
I feel like that's that sounds like where's the king jellyfish already?

1046
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:14,550
Is he up there?

1047
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:21,659
All right, I got I have five that is it's in a movie.

1048
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:23,780
It's a life hack.

1049
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,460
Mr. Bean did it.

1050
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,179
No, he didn't.

1051
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:28,219
He's too clean for that.

1052
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,809
I want to go up.

1053
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,489
Is there anything else I missed up there?

1054
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:40,840
I mean, he's not.

1055
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,489
Go back.

1056
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:48,969
Wrong way.

1057
01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:53,530
Mr. Bean is is too clean to do that.

1058
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,170
He's he's like PG clean, fun humor.

1059
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:56,650
He's not.

1060
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:08,150
It's like a cave in the trees.

1061
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,960
Germa, the trees.

1062
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,920
Germa, the trees.

1063
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:21,320
I mean, these the bouncy trees.

1064
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,110
Oh, look at those bouncy trees.

1065
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:28,710
Literally, no.

1066
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,380
Look, I can get up there with the bouncy tree.

1067
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:36,219
Watch.

1068
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,019
There's a sock over here.

1069
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,570
Get up there.

1070
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:52,570
Yeah, this is what I want.

1071
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:57,699
There's another bouncy right here.

1072
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,599
Somebody just say you're a dick.

1073
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:03,880
I'm a dick.

1074
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:05,559
What happened?

1075
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:10,170
Sorry, I had to I had to give Kim some information that was sensitive.

1076
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:13,289
So I had to say it very quietly without the mic on.

1077
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:21,769
I could sensitive info was crying.

1078
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:27,530
I'm going.

1079
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:33,400
I'm sitting there just crying like a second day back.

1080
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:39,659
I'm just going to the caves.

1081
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:40,940
Let's go go caves.

1082
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:47,769
He lost in a kid's game.

1083
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:54,699
It's only been like six months since he's done.

1084
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:55,260
Miss Piggy.

1085
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,960
What?

1086
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:09,340
It's that sponge kid and now what was I supposed to tell you?

1087
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,260
Oh, it's that SpongeBob kid.

1088
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,140
Now, what was I supposed to tell you?

1089
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,720
I think it has something to do with massaging my feet.

1090
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,479
What do you want to say it?

1091
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:49,539
I think we need to get into the Batmobile and get over there and destroy it.

1092
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:50,500
What should I say it?

1093
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,140
I should say it.

1094
01:08:52,340 --> 01:09:01,539
Fuck.

1095
01:09:01,539 --> 01:09:02,180
It's an old man.

1096
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:02,979
I just did that.

1097
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:03,479
Whoops.

1098
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,840
And my fingers slipped and it was an X button working quickly.

1099
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,720
This is a slide.

1100
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,399
When SpongeBob, Patrick, or Sandy jump onto a slide,

1101
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:18,520
they will zip down the slope at hydrodynamic speed.

1102
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:34,420
Didn't think I knew about the secret spot, did you?

1103
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:51,909
I was going so well, too.

1104
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:52,949
I was going so well.

1105
01:09:53,670 --> 01:10:06,619
Oh, so by the way, I didn't tell this story because there's too many over the last few months.

1106
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,920
Okay, seriously.

1107
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,880
Don't tell any stories.

1108
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,000
Get the fucking secret song.

1109
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:14,899
Play Half-Life.

1110
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:16,100
No, I don't want to play Half-Life.

1111
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:18,899
It's a fantastic series and it's one of my favorites.

1112
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:22,779
I've already done it a bunch of times.

1113
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:25,739
No, no, I want to do something else.

1114
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,539
But I'm on my tongue.

1115
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:28,039
That's fine.

1116
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,149
All right, so I don't know why.

1117
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:42,149
So you guys know I've been doing a lot of doctor's appointments, right?

1118
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:46,229
And at every single doctor's appointment, most of them check your vitals, right?

1119
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:48,310
So they'll check your temperature.

1120
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,869
They'll say, okay, let's do your blood pressure.

1121
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:52,229
Let's sit down for a second.

1122
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:53,510
Let's check your weight and all that, right?

1123
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:56,550
So I don't know why, but I've had my blood pressure checked

1124
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:03,350
like dozens of times, like probably 20 fucking times in the last six months, right?

1125
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:06,069
For this, for some reason now,

1126
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,710
like the last doctor's appointment I went to,

1127
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,949
I was getting the, it was an automatic machine.

1128
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:18,470
And while it was going on, while she came out, she put it on, she pressed the button.

1129
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,949
I started laughing so hard.

1130
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:21,670
I couldn't help it.

1131
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,149
I couldn't stop because it was crushing me.

1132
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,909
It was really, really uncomfortable.

1133
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:28,710
And the reason why I was laughing so hard is because

1134
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,720
you guys have seen the Beavis and Butthead episode

1135
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:35,960
where Beavis and Butthead are at like CVS or something.

1136
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,739
Beavis puts his arm in that thing and they think it's a ride.

1137
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:43,979
And he's trying, he's, it starts going on his arm and crushing him.

1138
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:46,220
And he starts freaking the fuck out because he doesn't know what it is.

1139
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,359
I was sitting there just thinking about Beavis and how I was like

1140
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:51,800
acting, kind of thinking that way.

1141
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,119
I was like, oh my God, I'm getting the fuck out of this.

1142
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:59,640
And I just, and they're laughing and I, I can't tell like the nurse why I'm laughing.

1143
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:02,039
Like, oh, what's, what's, is that funny?

1144
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,560
Yeah.

1145
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:08,119
Everyone Beavis like freaks out and his like face starts turning purple

1146
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:09,880
because he had this thing put on his arm.

1147
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,439
Remember that?

1148
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:12,060
Oh yeah.

1149
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,939
You, okay.

1150
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:13,739
Let me write that down.

1151
01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:21,930
I was, I don't know why I just started thinking about it.

1152
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:23,770
I couldn't stop.

1153
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,649
It was really tight though.

1154
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,439
Like Beavis and Butthead comedy type.

1155
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:41,939
I hit all three of these buttons, right?

1156
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:45,560
You're a loon.

1157
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,180
Bro, I don't think I am.

1158
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:58,149
Do you, hey, hey, hey.

1159
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:59,270
You think I'm a loon?

1160
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:02,390
One in chat, if yes.

1161
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:03,270
Two in chat, if no.

1162
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,670
You think I'm a loon?

1163
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,350
Can I buy costumes?

1164
01:13:24,619 --> 01:13:26,439
Okay.

1165
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:27,159
Where's the last one?

1166
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:28,920
Oh, there it is.

1167
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:36,890
Bart, Bart.

1168
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:41,180
I have a question.

1169
01:13:41,979 --> 01:13:46,380
Is like the Bart thing going to turn into like Johnny Depp?

1170
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,859
Is just Johnny Depp being a parody of himself as Captain Jack Sparrow

1171
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:51,979
because he's done it so many times?

1172
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:54,090
Is that going to happen to me?

1173
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,050
Like, is that happening to me?

1174
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,460
Like, like it's no longer Johnny Depp doing Captain Jack Sparrow.

1175
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,180
It's just Johnny Depp pretending to be Captain Jack Sparrow.

1176
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,539
It's not actually Captain Jack Sparrow.

1177
01:14:09,539 --> 01:14:11,140
Do you guys know what I'm talking about when I mean that?

1178
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,779
When I say that?

1179
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:18,060
You know, like it feels real.

1180
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,510
It feels like it's, it feels like just acting.

1181
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,029
Somebody knows what I mean by that, right?

1182
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:25,590
Like it's, it's like Johnny Depp is like doing a parody

1183
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:28,390
almost of himself when he's doing it now.

1184
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,189
Does that make any sense?

1185
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,380
Absolutely.

1186
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:38,779
Thank you.

1187
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,390
Thank you one guy.

1188
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:45,590
All right.

1189
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:46,390
So what did that do for me?

1190
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,199
Oh, Patrick.

1191
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,489
Nobody said that.

1192
01:14:50,489 --> 01:14:50,729
Yeah.

1193
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:51,609
At least 10 people did.

1194
01:14:52,250 --> 01:15:02,500
Germa Johnny Depp.

1195
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,460
Germa what?

1196
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,300
Hey, SpongeBob.

1197
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:11,720
Your cherry picking responses.

1198
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,159
Thank goodness you're safe, Patrick.

1199
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:19,289
Well, of course, SpongeBob.

1200
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:20,250
Why wouldn't I be?

1201
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:23,770
Only pull out the ones that agree with you and don't

1202
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,130
and just ignore the sea of people that disagree.

1203
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,470
Did you guys think I'm right?

1204
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:36,729
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

1205
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:37,289
No, no.

1206
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:38,090
Oh, you think I'm right.

1207
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:38,329
Thanks.

1208
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:38,489
Cool.

1209
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:39,050
Thank you.

1210
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:39,289
Cool.

1211
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:41,130
I know I am.

1212
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,199
Patrick, I tell you what.

1213
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:54,439
All that running around has left me pooped.

1214
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:56,279
Why don't you continue on for a bit?

1215
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:57,079
You literally do that.

1216
01:15:57,079 --> 01:15:58,279
You have an emote about it.

1217
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:08,630
Where's.

1218
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:11,029
I'm Patrick now.

1219
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:22,810
can he fly? I feel like he can fly. No. Don't you think he can lie down flat like a starfish

1220
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:34,170
and glide or spin and glide? This is a throw fruit. Patrick can pick up a throw fruit and throw

1221
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:43,989
them. Press the B button to pick up a nearby throw fruit. Okay. Use it quickly. It wilts after a few

1222
01:16:43,989 --> 01:17:04,520
seconds. How far can you throw it? That was a bad example. Oh, there's a lock on. Patrick can also

1223
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:09,399
pick up and throw tiki's, but only tiki's that don't have other tiki's stacked on top of them.

1224
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:30,199
How do I throw to that guy? So shiny. Patrick can throw fruit up steps. What's happening?

1225
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:34,840
And climb the steps, pick up the fruit and throw it again. But he better hurt before it wilts.

1226
01:17:43,989 --> 01:18:06,390
Real voice. No, it wasn't. Morty. Real Morty. Oh, fuck. I didn't read. Okay. You can throw stuff.

1227
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:13,029
Read. This is a thunder tiki. When Patrick touches it, it will begin to storm and after a few

1228
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:21,289
seconds it will go boom. Don't be near it when it goes boom. How many pairs of underwear does

1229
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:38,579
Patrick have? The same. I feel like these are here for a reason. Oh, whoops. Okay. Anything else over

1230
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:51,859
her? Oh, I can read it. This is a special Patrick teeter totter that only Patrick can use. Okay.

1231
01:18:51,859 --> 01:19:04,090
That's a really important point. SpongeBob can't use this shit. He didn't notice. Why is everybody

1232
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:17,159
jabbing? Patrick, keepo. Keepo happy. Okay. Who's your, who, are you ready? Who's your favorite

1233
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:37,800
SpongeBob character? I'll tell you mine after you tell me yours. Okay. Okay.

1234
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,659
Okay. I'm seeing a lot of, yeah, I'm seeing a lot of things that I would do.

1235
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:45,020
Oh, hi there, Mr. Plankton. Are you going to vaporize me today?

1236
01:19:46,579 --> 01:19:54,500
So very tempting. Unfortunately, I found myself in the undesirable position of having to assist you.

1237
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:02,420
The guy that screams, yeah. I was in an undesirable position yesterday and now my neck hurts.

1238
01:20:03,859 --> 01:20:07,539
Which Looney Tune Daffy Duck would I be? That's easy. Which Looney Tune character would you be

1239
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:14,899
Daffy Duck? Or the Road Runner because I'm really fast and explosive. Either one. Combine them.

1240
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:32,199
Not anymore. No, maybe not. Go into Jellyfish Cave, follow the instructions and sign.

1241
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:37,079
At the end of the caves, you'll still be a big idiot, but you'll know enough to help

1242
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:44,409
defeat the robots. Well, then will you vaporize me? I might spare your life so I can force you

1243
01:20:44,409 --> 01:20:50,329
to work in my sweatshop, making low quality design and knock off wallets. Oh, thank you.

1244
01:20:53,560 --> 01:21:02,250
The intel is his favorite character. Road Runner. Oh, for SpongeBob. Right. Have you guys ever seen

1245
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:07,369
a Road Runner in real life? They are the most, they're the best favorite bird on earth. They're

1246
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:14,949
the most cute little funny little guys. They're amazing. They're so cool. The way they run,

1247
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:20,729
they got those funny little mohawks. They're little, they're not huge. They're fast. They

1248
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:31,899
go like 25 miles per hour. They're fast. Oh, stalling, stalling. Oh, right, right. Favorite

1249
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:40,470
SpongeBob character. It's free season five. It's going to be Patrick. Post season six,

1250
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:58,729
it's going to be Mr. Krabs. That's a, that's, that's a really hot take, dude. What the

1251
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:02,170
fuck is he saying? I'm talking about my favorite SpongeBob characters. The four seasons,

1252
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:09,000
whatever the early one I said, Patrick's my favorite character. And then after season five,

1253
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:25,189
after season five, it's Mr. Krabs. I just think he's funny. Don't watch past season four. See,

1254
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:32,470
I don't agree with that. I know, I know that like the first four or five seasons were like just way

1255
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:43,699
better. I know they were. And then like after like season 10, it was like, okay, I do this twice.

1256
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:55,350
This joke is as salvageable as the Titanic. Talking about who my favorite

1257
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:07,140
character in SpongeBob is. That's, wait, what? That's, that's a, what do you mean joke?

1258
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:22,859
Season one came out when you were like 20. I don't know. I mean, just do the math. Yeah.

1259
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:30,199
Something like that. I thought it was great. I can't jump. I can't jump. Hold on. Can I throw

1260
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:48,949
this? How far can I throw this? Give it to me. Come on. Dan here. He just fell. This dude's

1261
01:23:48,949 --> 01:24:03,289
fucking ancient. Sorry, I'm over 30. Fuck. What's happening? I, what, so what happens when I turn?

1262
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:12,810
Like, all right, you get out of here. Like I'm paying attention. I don't care about anything

1263
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:26,500
right now. Hold on. That's what I wanted to do. Here we are. Thank you. That's much better.

1264
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:39,109
When are you going to do new emotes? No, I don't think I'm ever going to give a date for that

1265
01:24:39,109 --> 01:24:43,590
because I keep saying I'm going to make new emotes and then a year goes by and nothing happens.

1266
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:51,350
I just like massive spam went through a bunch of stuff on a better Twitch because I was like,

1267
01:24:51,350 --> 01:25:09,659
yeah, let's just add like 10 of them. We're so lonely. There will be.

1268
01:25:10,779 --> 01:25:16,970
I don't know. The way to throw fruit will also activate pressure plates. Okay, cool.

1269
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:31,539
Now I can run through, but wait. Yeah, whatever. Patrick can also jump up on a throw fruit to get

1270
01:25:31,539 --> 01:25:36,180
to higher places. You may stack throw fruits as well by throwing a throw fruit on top of another

1271
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:41,539
throw fruit to allow Patrick to get to even higher places. Well, don't they, don't they have to wait

1272
01:25:41,539 --> 01:26:13,960
respond? Does that not matter right now? This is kind of how, it's just kind of how I feel

1273
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,180
like 40% of every day. Can I tell you that? Not like that. Not like that. Not like that. Not like

1274
01:26:19,180 --> 01:27:05,500
that. Not like that. Okay, let's play. Let's throw them this way. No, the lock. I can still do it.

1275
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:47,670
Good work. Oh, I didn't know this is a slide. I'm lost. I want to spend some of this. Oh wait,

1276
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:53,670
Patrick can drink this, right? This is a freeze fruit. Patrick's favorite. They can throw it.

1277
01:27:54,789 --> 01:28:03,939
Freeze goo. You can slide on it until it thaws. Let's take a look. Well, that's interesting.

1278
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:09,449
Do it again in a minute. I'm gonna go up there first. Oh, spatula.

1279
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:20,739
Patrick's belly flops into your robots. He can damage or stun them. That's awesome.

1280
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:27,460
It's the same sound effects as Spyro. It was the same team. Maybe it was the same team.

1281
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:37,640
Powered. That is pretty well powered actually. That's much better. It was the same death team.

1282
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:55,779
That's pretty cool. Patrick may even pick up robots he has stunned and throw them into other

1283
01:28:55,779 --> 01:29:17,770
robots. Oh, well, I crushed him. Almost happened. I want to try it. All right, well, that's you.

1284
01:29:18,649 --> 01:30:05,640
You're too close. All right, that thing was small. That's cool, but when am I ever going to

1285
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:19,449
use that besides rolling into a bucket? Oh, well, that didn't even do what I thought it was going

1286
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:43,380
to do. And spatula. This game sucks. It doesn't. It really doesn't. It's fine. This game does not

1287
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:56,329
suck. Wait, I want to do the ice thing. This may in fact be the last great licensed video game. Is

1288
01:30:56,329 --> 01:31:12,659
that true? Could be. That accurate? No. What was the last great licensed video game based on like

1289
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:19,659
a cartoon or a TV show or a movie? I'm not sure I count comic books right now.

1290
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:29,720
It's like Batman, Spider-Man. I'm talking about like TV show. Just based on a TV show.

1291
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:35,880
Not on like an iconic character that's been around in like comic books and shit for like 50 years.

1292
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:41,500
Batman's been around for a very long time. I'm talking like solely like a licensed movie

1293
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:47,989
video game or a licensed TV show video game. You don't count it because it answers it. No,

1294
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:55,050
because I gave separate criteria like TV show only. Spider-Man wasn't a TV show for like 30 years

1295
01:31:55,770 --> 01:32:04,899
before. Wait, what? What did Spider-Man get invented? Probably South Park. I mean,

1296
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:27,029
it's a signed Seinfeld Samurai Jack game. Is that good? What? Okay, why so many people just said it

1297
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:47,689
and then now so many people are saying no. There's a purple one over there. These guys talk.

1298
01:32:51,909 --> 01:33:03,100
I'm good. Got what I wanted. South Park games have been good and weirdly enough I never gave

1299
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:09,140
either one of them a chance and I always knew that they were good. Don't ask me why. I don't know.

1300
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:21,050
Ahoy there. Squidward tells me you're looking for the king jellyfish. Here we are. Yes. Good thing

1301
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:26,569
too. That monster has been stinging all my good customers in their poop decks. I hear that you

1302
01:33:26,569 --> 01:33:31,930
can find him up top of Old Sport Mountain here. Shark Tank? Go hook that beast, sailor. Dude,

1303
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:37,529
I would love a Shark Tank video game even if it was dog shit. You know how much fun that would be?

1304
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:43,829
Why didn't they make that for the Wii? Imagine with the Wii mode and shit you make like a product

1305
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:49,350
and it would be like shitty 3D rendered Mark Cuban. I wanted that. I want that for the Wii,

1306
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:57,939
like a 2005 version of that game. Shark Tank didn't exist in 2005. Why not? Oh boy, Mr. Krabs,

1307
01:33:57,939 --> 01:34:06,199
I'll see what I can do. Like I'm talking about I want Mark Cuban to be rendered in the terrain

1308
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:11,479
editor. Not even like the model. You know I want like a pure just like old fucking shitty 3D video

1309
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:50,979
game. Boss fight. This whole body was chattering but not his tongue. You're not going to take all

1310
01:34:50,979 --> 01:35:10,949
my 3882 coins are you? No you just killed. That was he was not even a big deal. Oh it's this guy.

1311
01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:15,449
This guy's my favorite character in Spongebob. I remember this. Yeah this guy's my favorite. You

1312
01:35:15,449 --> 01:35:20,810
know why? Because this guy always reminded me of those little aliens from the Jim Henson Muffet

1313
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:26,710
shit. The guys that go like yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep that's my favorite

1314
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:43,739
character. I just didn't know what his name was. It was guy with huge folding down mouth.

1315
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:55,880
Hello Mrs. Puff. Hello Patrick. I've got a job for you to do. Oh boy. Actually it could be it could

1316
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,479
be Mrs. Puff. I found a golden spatula. Yeah it might be Mrs. Puff. I stole it and threw it into

1317
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:05,880
the lake. Yeah no I changed my answer. It's Mrs. Puff. That's my favorite character. You're welcome

1318
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:27,909
to it. I remember she's so fun. Showing off Mrs. Puff. She doesn't do anything. She's actually one

1319
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:36,279
of the only characters in the entire series that is very concerned with how fucking how Spongebob

1320
01:36:36,279 --> 01:36:56,659
like breaks shit and hurts people. The only character in the whole series. This farm? What

1321
01:36:56,659 --> 01:37:03,800
about Squidward? I think Squidward's just irritated that he exists and like hates him because he

1322
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:10,760
exists. I'm not sure Squidward's ever concerned about anything he does. I think he just hates

1323
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:17,640
him. It's never like ah Spongebob why did you do that? Let me tell you some ways that you could

1324
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:24,119
do that differently instead of throwing my fluid into the dumpster. No he's just like you're an idiot

1325
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:31,380
I hate you. Mrs. Puff is like Spongebob did you hit the break? Just slowly my friend. Like he

1326
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:44,899
Mrs. Puff tries to help him. Oh um well uh no. What am I supposed to do? Did you get the golden

1327
01:37:44,899 --> 01:37:49,060
spatula back from the robots on the island? Okay robots on the island get the spatula from the

1328
01:37:49,060 --> 01:38:07,060
robots on the island. You got it. I have to get I have to kill that. Oh I know what to do. Throw the

1329
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:21,180
nuke. Get double tapped? Fun. I don't think Spongebob's underwear fits Squidward right.

1330
01:38:23,739 --> 01:38:45,850
Wait should I? Hmm I haven't thought of that. Farming. Can I not reach from there?

1331
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:59,350
Do I have to just just destroy all the buildings? I can't reach from here. Use the guard breaker.

1332
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:15,560
Dude you're killing me. Oh just kill me right because these are robots that are they just

1333
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:22,520
just kill me like organic or just kill kill me into a robot too. I made a whole game about this.

1334
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:43,130
I played it. How do I get over this? Can I not throw them? Wait a minute should I? Throwing.

1335
01:39:43,210 --> 01:40:06,460
Should I just walk around and throw it at that? I can't reach from there. I oh I can get them on

1336
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:20,840
the bridge. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Children's game.

1337
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:34,659
Children's game. Children's game. Children's game. Lost in children's game. Sorry children's game.

1338
01:40:34,659 --> 01:40:52,869
It's still there. The Simpsons hit and run all over again. No it's not. This is gonna be like

1339
01:40:53,829 --> 01:41:02,729
have I ever played a game like this before? I don't think I have. Wait what was that game

1340
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:18,659
that was Yooka-Laylee? Yooka-Laylee. Oh Mario Sunshine. Yeah yeah I didn't play Mario Odyssey

1341
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:28,659
on stream. Played it a little bit off stream and by the way let me tell you oh perfect don't listen

1342
01:41:28,659 --> 01:41:35,510
to what that guy said to you like two hours ago. No. That's much better. I'm gonna go.

1343
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:43,289
I'm gonna go this way. Well done Patrick. You're a real star.

1344
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:56,920
Can I get a cookie? No. Swap characters. Oh I guess I don't feel like playing with um Patrick

1345
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:01,939
anymore. This is a shticky. SpongeBob will have to sneak up on it in order to destroy it.

1346
01:42:04,039 --> 01:42:12,729
Ah okay. Patrick may throw things at it from a distance. Well let's change back to SpongeBob.

1347
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:23,020
It's a sneak.

1348
01:42:45,189 --> 01:43:16,579
That's what they see. You know what I mean? Like I bite him. Bite him. He's coming. SpongeBob's

1349
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:46,119
a little less strong. Dude you're unhinged. Shit. Wait there's something up there. There are

1350
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:52,260
underwear up there. I yeah I'm gonna go get that stuff. Put on Doom OST. You want me to

1351
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:55,539
replace SpongeBob music with Doom OST? Now here comes a real fight in the chat.

1352
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:13,289
This is gonna get interesting I think. I feel like a new sponge. That would be funny. Put it

1353
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:35,909
though. Oh I'm not sure that would be very funny. Absolutely funny. SpongeBob should come back here

1354
01:44:35,909 --> 01:44:46,760
later when he knows the crew's bubble move. Oh I don't know the crew's bubble move. What the hell am

1355
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:57,529
I supposed to do? He's vetoing it. Oh that already did. That already happened. That was vetoed when I

1356
01:44:57,529 --> 01:45:23,399
read the D in Doom OST. It's very relaxing. Okay I want to get that sock. It goes all the way around.

1357
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:36,329
Okay let's ask you to keep moving. It kind of worked. This is not relaxing at all.

1358
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:52,100
You don't think this is relaxing? You don't think so? Did I go on the wall? Where did I go?

1359
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:09,510
You've never been like sitting on the beach and this is just kind of playing?

1360
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:13,270
Stuff like this is just like that's like that's what they're playing on the beach.

1361
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:35,300
No no no. But you've never gone to any restaurant or a little bar on the beach?

1362
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:42,979
They all play this music. Everyone just looks around and goes like yeah yeah. You get a big

1363
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:47,779
like sip of the drink. Yeah. You just nod your head the whole time that you're in there.

1364
01:46:48,979 --> 01:47:04,810
No they don't. Yeah they do. I've been in the same room when this happened. You take the sip of your

1365
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:12,250
big drink with the umbrella in it. You know the big like big shoe drink. It's a huge glass like

1366
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:37,689
shoe thing. This is a stone Tiki. That's what you know. Can I tell you? Stone is one of my favorite

1367
01:47:37,689 --> 01:47:46,149
words. Cannot be destroyed with ordinary moves. It can be blown up by thunder Tiki. Beach in Vegas.

1368
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:51,270
Guys I'm I'm 34 years old. You don't think I've ever been to a beach before with a drink in my

1369
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:56,310
like on the on like the beach waterfront or like a beach restaurant before up when I'm in my like

1370
01:47:56,310 --> 01:48:08,539
early 20s. As long as these pants are square and this sponge is bob I will not let Bikini Bottom

1371
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:16,859
down. You don't think I've ever been to a beach restaurant where it's like oh we have this like

1372
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:27,899
little beach drink. Oh I'll take one. And the person that you're across from you go try this.

1373
01:48:27,899 --> 01:48:34,420
Try. And both of you take a sip of each other's like drinks. You go like oh whoa this is what he

1374
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:42,420
got. And then you never go back ever for the rest of your fucking life. You never go back

1375
01:48:42,420 --> 01:49:12,979
to this restaurant or bar ever again. Get him. We got that one wrong. Holy shit that's a lot of

1376
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:26,420
stone in there. That's a lot of stone in there. I want to see it. Yes. 150 bucks open this.

1377
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:38,699
Is that worth doing? I only have 6,700. Do I watch Veggie Tales? No I never did.

1378
01:49:44,489 --> 01:50:03,909
Veggie Tales for me was just Alvin and the Chipmunks but scary. And this is somebody that's an avid

1379
01:50:03,909 --> 01:50:09,590
listener of Alvin and the Chipmunks. And by avid listener I mean that every time an Alvin and the

1380
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:14,310
Chipmunk song ever came on the radio it was immediately being turned down four or five

1381
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:20,310
notches on the volume. That's how you know an Alvin and the Chipmunk song has come on the radio.

1382
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:42,710
You immediately drop the button. I'm dead. You're not a Christian. Aren't you a Christian?

1383
01:50:43,350 --> 01:51:04,939
What do you think? Who told you that? Oh this is Patrick. Okay there's never been one time on

1384
01:51:04,939 --> 01:51:10,699
stream where I've been like and guys I want to make sure everyone knows I'm a I'm a Christian.

1385
01:51:12,069 --> 01:51:31,619
I don't whatever. I don't give a shit who you are. He said it. You're deranged. Okay hold on.

1386
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:38,520
Oh I want the facts. I want the facts out here. So me just saying you know guys no I've never

1387
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,479
mentioned that before. I'm not a Christian. I've never said that. He's fucking deranged.

1388
01:51:44,439 --> 01:52:08,949
Somebody wrap him up quick. Where's this uh thing spawning? Oh over there. He's getting political.

1389
01:52:08,949 --> 01:52:17,989
Cut the mic. Get my mic off. It's on forever. You know unless there's a power outage.

1390
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:42,039
I told you that today was a weird one. I told you I was in a weird mood and I knew something.

1391
01:52:42,039 --> 01:52:49,159
I told you. I prepared you guys two hours ago. I did. I told you two hours ago. Right? I did.

1392
01:52:49,159 --> 01:53:14,760
I warned you. I can go to one of the new areas now. I can go downtown right? Holy shit. This is

1393
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:21,859
such a random lol stream. He's so random. Thanks for saying that dude. I try so hard to be like

1394
01:53:21,859 --> 01:53:43,819
random. Does it work? Is it working? I need 10 of these right? I want to get up here. I gotta go

1395
01:53:43,819 --> 01:53:58,550
all the way around and there's another sock over there. Hulk burger nom nom. Oh boy. Now he's just

1396
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:04,569
pandering. Oh you know what pandering looks like on this channel. I think that's what's happening

1397
01:54:04,569 --> 01:54:14,600
right now. I know what that's like. I know what that is. There's that sock all the way across.

1398
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:26,090
Oh this is gonna be annoying. What the fuck? I knocked him to the other side.

1399
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:50,939
Wait freeze this stuff. Shit I hate I hate when I have to come back as other characters.

1400
01:54:50,939 --> 01:54:57,020
There's so much content to do. What a fun game. What a great amount of content they've given me.

1401
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:26,729
No. That's what happened to Donkey Kong 64. You know I'll be honest I really didn't play Donkey

1402
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:35,619
Kong 64 really at all. I really didn't. How did I miss that? Remember hearing the emergency

1403
01:55:35,619 --> 01:55:39,539
broadcast thing? Like this is a test of the emergency broadcasting system. Did you just hear

1404
01:55:39,539 --> 01:56:04,539
that? I did. It's weird. I know that they do that all the time to test it and everything but holy

1405
01:56:04,539 --> 01:56:10,539
shit it doesn't scare the absolute hell out of you. I've been in the car before with like the radio on

1406
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:13,819
and all of a sudden you're just like kind of oh the radio's just on this and

1407
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:23,750
it's like what the fuck happened? And then you're sitting there waiting. You're waiting. You're

1408
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:31,000
sitting. You're in the car and you're out of red light and you hear that like and you're sitting

1409
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:35,159
there going uh oh okay what happened? And you're just kind of looking around waiting to see a

1410
01:56:35,159 --> 01:56:40,119
bunch of other cars just start fucking driving. That's how you know that they like got it first

1411
01:56:40,119 --> 01:56:46,220
or something. They like they're hearing it too. You're at a red light. You see like four cars just

1412
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:49,180
start speeding away. It's like uh oh what's this what's this gonna say?

1413
01:56:51,189 --> 01:57:03,210
I think that they should really before doing that they should go like

1414
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:09,939
excuse me just want to let you know that there's about to be a test of the emergency broadcast

1415
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:27,750
system. Here it comes. Like I know here it comes right? I'm kind of going the wrong way aren't I?

1416
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:32,710
They do it every time. No no no they make the loud noise first and then the guy comes on.

1417
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:40,340
They make the and then the guy goes hey just letting you know. Here comes the test.

1418
01:57:46,949 --> 01:57:52,810
Where is the box? Back box idiot idiot. Where's it? Where is it though? I don't I don't remember

1419
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:56,729
where it is. Where's it from here? You're going the wrong way. I know I'm trying to figure it out.

1420
01:57:57,369 --> 01:58:06,810
Play the actual sound. No no no I'm not doing that. I I think remember before like I don't think you

1421
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:18,250
could do that. No no no I'm not doing it. No now I'm not gonna why am I gonna do that? I'm

1422
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:29,140
not gonna play the emergency broadcast sound. Somebody will be in their bathroom and somebody

1423
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:33,220
like went to go take a dump like fucking 30 minutes ago and they left the stream and now

1424
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:37,300
they turn it back on and they hear that. Yeah I don't want to do that. No that's no that's

1425
01:58:37,300 --> 01:59:14,460
fucked up. I don't want to do that. Did I pick Patrick? How did I miss this? I'm also disappointed

1426
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:19,659
that this is not. Hold on. Me not you. I'm disappointed that this is not. No why would

1427
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:29,210
I be disappointed? I'm not gonna say what I was gonna say. Imagine only imagine only needing 30

1428
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:36,810
minutes to dump. I'm not gonna be known as the guy that just talks about like going to the bathroom

1429
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:53,289
every stream. We need at least one in between where I don't do that. Oh super monster combo.

1430
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:59,029
I'm not gonna do the Diablo 3 thing where it just does that every time right?

1431
01:59:59,029 --> 02:00:08,119
Remember that? Remember Diablo 3? How cool that was the first like 2000 times it said

1432
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:14,859
wow plus 200 experience bonus super ultra kill and how badly you just wanted to fucking turn

1433
02:00:14,859 --> 02:00:28,899
that off and never say that ever again. They never let you turn it off. Diablo 3 by the way

1434
02:00:28,899 --> 02:00:33,460
I'm not talking about Diablo 2. SpongeBob can jump up walls well then why would I be Patrick?

1435
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:44,359
Sound like a broken man. Still been thinking about that setting I couldn't undo and I don't

1436
02:00:44,359 --> 02:01:01,340
know why I was supposed to say Mario 3. Yes I know SpongeBob can do it. All right SpongeBob let's go.

1437
02:01:08,779 --> 02:01:22,489
Cool. Care about the game he's playing. What are you talking about? I'm having a blast. I'm having a

1438
02:01:22,489 --> 02:01:48,180
great time. And look I got now I have 10 nine spatulas. There it was again. Who makes that noise?

1439
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:55,319
It's the robots that do it? Oh shit this is King Jellyfish. His first major major encounter

1440
02:01:55,319 --> 02:02:11,989
of the game. Gosh everyone is trying to help out today. Look at that I know what he's doing.

1441
02:02:11,989 --> 02:02:19,510
Step quietly there that King Jellyfish is just up at the top of this path. Good luck you'll need it.

1442
02:02:20,869 --> 02:02:32,119
Thanks Bubble Buddy. I feel like a new sponge. All right here we go. Get on top of Bubba Mountain.

1443
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,600
Actually it's huge.

1444
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:54,260
I knew the King Jellyfish was big but who knew he had such a beautiful voice.

1445
02:02:54,260 --> 02:03:10,329
Slap him. Is any of this based on an episode or something that he's based on?

1446
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:39,029
And you got to slap him in the head. Wait open this. I can't open that. There it is. Slap him again.

1447
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:48,010
Like a spring breeze. He's gonna lose the King Jellyfish. No I will not.

1448
02:03:48,010 --> 02:04:04,579
I feel like a new sponge. Desperate grab. But how many Wiimotes does the jellyfish have too?

1449
02:04:05,619 --> 02:04:24,550
Who cares about the ads? Just kill the guy. Why is he getting so close?

1450
02:04:24,949 --> 02:04:30,100
Fast. Oh that was fast.

1451
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:52,390
Peanut butter. I could go for some peanut butter right now. Peanut butter and flop sandwich.

1452
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:57,350
Or a deconstructed peanut butter and flop sandwich.

1453
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:02,789
Will you just take a spoon and you take a big spoonful of peanut butter put it in your mouth

1454
02:05:02,789 --> 02:05:08,039
and a big spoonful of fluff put it in your mouth. I did that. I still do that all the time.

1455
02:05:09,079 --> 02:05:15,260
You're 35 years old. What's wrong with eating peanut butter? Peanut butter is perfect.

1456
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:23,609
I feel like a new sponge. All right so what does that thing do? Oh that's the jelly I needed.

1457
02:05:24,569 --> 02:05:31,579
Don't you don't say deconstructed.

1458
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:44,979
Oh deconstructed. That makes me so happy. You're such a hipster. Wait this is like a

1459
02:05:45,779 --> 02:05:54,149
we're gonna get like a goodbye from the level. We're gonna be ready. Wait give me that one.

1460
02:05:54,869 --> 02:06:14,420
I got it. What the fuck is that? Hey there it looks like you'll have to make a huge

1461
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:17,779
jump at the end of that ramp in order to reach that golden spatula.

1462
02:06:18,659 --> 02:06:25,800
Cowabunga. Wow that's a mighty big leap. I think I can do it. I can make it. A jump at the end of

1463
02:06:25,800 --> 02:07:08,489
that. At the end I can. Yep that's how he dies. SpongeBob's on like drugs. Oh no look where I am.

1464
02:07:19,029 --> 02:07:32,010
Run saved. Get the box. Get the box. Get the box. I got it. Okay I'm good. Open the box. I got it.

1465
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:43,109
The stream is delayed. The stream is delayed. All right should I go at the end of

1466
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:49,829
should I'm gonna see what happens at the very end of the whole thing. Turn somewhere. I mean look

1467
02:07:49,829 --> 02:08:00,710
at that. Where does this go? Does this wrap around? This wraps around. Okay here we go.

1468
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:27,619
Thank you. Back to the main menu. Here you go Squidward.

1469
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:43,369
Oh yeah I feel so much better. Can I rub some on? What if I just gave you this?

1470
02:08:49,050 --> 02:09:04,069
How many spatulas are in the game? 120? This is why I don't go outside ever. Is it 100?

1471
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:16,340
That's kind of a lot. That's cool. Okay hold on. No no I'm gonna go check out the other zones. I

1472
02:09:16,979 --> 02:09:24,739
stick in one area the whole time. Please stop the music. But what if the music changes in a new area?

1473
02:09:26,899 --> 02:09:38,659
See the music. Look the music's already changed. Please stop. No I'm not going to turn the music

1474
02:09:38,659 --> 02:09:45,989
off. It's it's classic SpongeBob music. Okay this is all right. I have a question. Does it consume

1475
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:49,989
them or do you just have to have them? I don't answer that. My question was already answered.

1476
02:10:04,199 --> 02:10:16,819
Goo Lagoon? Downtown or Goo Lagoon? Which one? That sounds more interesting.

1477
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:30,579
Downtown? There's a lot of downtowns. Somebody said this is a concerning amount of missiles.

1478
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:36,779
Okay we're at the bottom of the ocean right? Something really fucked up is going on up there.

1479
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:41,560
This is some World War 3 type shit.

1480
02:10:42,119 --> 02:10:58,180
Downtown Bikini Bottom. Once a bustling metropolis. Now a debris covered crater.

1481
02:10:58,899 --> 02:11:07,819
Oh it's just debris? SpongeBob the robots are destroying Downtown Bikini Bottom. We have to

1482
02:11:07,819 --> 02:11:13,140
evacuate. Definitely favorite character for sure. All right but it's gonna take a while to get all

1483
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:21,659
this dust. Not vacuum. Evacuate. We have to get everyone to safety. Evacue? Can we just load them

1484
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:29,100
up in the boats? That won't do any good. Why not? Because the robots have taken all the steering

1485
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:37,500
wheels. Couldn't we just drive in a straight line? No there are too many turns. Those fiends,

1486
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:41,659
they thought of everything. Never fear Mrs Puff. I'll get those steering wheels back. True.

1487
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:49,659
Why are we seeing? Why did I see even one true? SpongeBob if you're involved I always fear.

1488
02:11:49,659 --> 02:11:55,500
But I tell you what if you can pull this off I'll give you a golden spatula. Get all the wheels.

1489
02:11:56,859 --> 02:12:00,460
How about a driver's license instead? Nice try.

1490
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:18,760
There's one and it's 11. I need 11 steering wheels. What else is over here?

1491
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:24,859
By the way 15 spatulas gets me to the... This place takes place in Texas.

1492
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:53,020
Oh wait. Explode. Blow up. Who's throwing trash cans at me? Who's throwing garbage cans at me?

1493
02:12:53,020 --> 02:13:13,500
Oh you. That was weird. That was kind of like... I didn't like that. That made me feel uncomfortable.

1494
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:32,840
That was strange. Blow up. Oh wait I can get a sock from Patrick right?

1495
02:13:40,539 --> 02:13:51,880
Me too. I love opening presents too. Secret? Yep. Good call. Oop-wine sock.

1496
02:13:55,770 --> 02:14:07,770
Get that person out of here. Get that person out of here. Nobody said that? Yes they did.

1497
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:15,289
Scroll up. Scroll up. I mean there's like over 9,000 people here. You're gonna have to scroll up a

1498
02:14:15,289 --> 02:14:31,979
little bit. Don't ever tell me I can't do anything. Because I can. I thought I could hit it back.

1499
02:14:37,779 --> 02:14:40,100
Why did I think I could hit it back? That's what I want to know.

1500
02:14:45,689 --> 02:15:02,039
Please. All right. Can I jump on the lamps? What happened? Oh he did it for me. Wait a minute.

1501
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:23,850
Oh well that's neat. I'm gonna do that to all of them. One, two, three. Do it. Over here. Nice.

1502
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:51,560
Do it again. Nice. Bachelor. I love it. I love it. I'm gonna die. Put on some pants.

1503
02:15:52,199 --> 02:15:59,500
I'll get them. They're all over the place. I'll collect them. Is there a drivable car?

1504
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:08,920
Can I go over here? I already went over here.

1505
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:17,750
SpongeBob doesn't have a license. We see him driving around every episode.

1506
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:27,159
He's always driving around and like crashing and stuff isn't he? And doesn't Mrs. Puff sitting

1507
02:16:27,159 --> 02:16:32,920
there going like, SpongeBob you need to do me a quick favor and hit the brake. Right? That happens

1508
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:47,879
all the time. This looks like cheese puff SpongeBob. You can roll but you can't do anything else.

1509
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:55,260
Being hurt or pressing any button will change you back. What the hell?

1510
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:42,489
Let's try that again. What? What are they doing? Thank god for Gary. No I want to be the SpongeBob.

1511
02:17:47,079 --> 02:17:58,920
Can I read? This robot is called G. Love. The best way to deal with him is to bubble bounce him from

1512
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:14,920
above. Stop. I want to roll around. Whatever. I saved your life. Wait, did it again? That was

1513
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:33,780
awesome. That was such an awesome move. All right. Don't touch the red stuff. Okay. Is it hot sauce?

1514
02:18:35,129 --> 02:18:48,680
Volcano sauce. Oh, there's a wheel. Wait. How would I press this? Brew. Cool. All right. Cool.

1515
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:58,309
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I do? Let's roll around. Let them blow up. I think. Yeah.

1516
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:09,989
I don't want to be the little ball anymore. Stop hitting them, Jeremy.

1517
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:26,360
I know. I'm trying to listen. That was pretty sick. Oh, this bubble buddy. This door is locked

1518
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:37,190
from the inside. Who would do such a thing? Psycho? SpongeBob ice cream from the ice cream truck

1519
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:42,340
is the best ice cream. I agree. And that's not even what you said. I just said that after you.

1520
02:19:43,219 --> 02:19:57,819
I want to get up there. Watch this. Watch this. Ready? Are you guys watching?

1521
02:19:57,819 --> 02:20:05,700
Oh, wait. Don't watch this part. I go higher on the trampoline.

1522
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:22,360
I get that from here. Hey, vaude watchers. Why don't you skip forward? Don't do that. You're

1523
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:57,059
going to miss the best joke of the whole night. How does this go? What was the joke? I didn't do

1524
02:20:57,059 --> 02:21:04,340
it yet. I just said, if you skip. Most people, when they skip, they go like 20 minutes. They go

1525
02:21:05,299 --> 02:21:11,450
forward, forward, forward. And they go 10, 15, 20 minutes forward. You don't just go like 10

1526
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:19,049
seconds forward. Who skips 10 seconds on like a more than three, four, five, six hour vaude?

1527
02:21:36,709 --> 02:21:46,950
I actually do. All right. I've got 10 K of these things. Can I dump them with the bag upside down

1528
02:21:46,950 --> 02:22:04,569
at the bank? What do I do with these? Buy weapons. Oh, that's cool. I'll give it to Mr. Krabs. I guess

1529
02:22:04,569 --> 02:22:19,420
I really haven't explored completely the hub world, have I? Give them to Mr. Krabs. I will in a minute.

1530
02:22:19,979 --> 02:22:32,149
I just like jumping around. It's fun. You can open up areas with them. Oh, that's cool.

1531
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:48,459
I know how to get this open. Just make him angry. Oh, all right. Now what do I go from here? Kill

1532
02:22:48,459 --> 02:22:59,899
this guy. I'm at the joke waiting room. Oh shit. All right. Uh, okay. Let's think here. Think quick.

1533
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:11,190
So, um, somebody said something about toothpaste, right? It's quick. Somebody said like a toothbrush.

1534
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:15,430
The guy from like 1700s having a toothpaste with sand in his mouth. Somebody say, somebody do

1535
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:22,680
something like that. Quick. I'm in a lot of trouble here. You'll have to open this door.

1536
02:23:23,479 --> 02:23:41,899
How do I get up there? Open this door from the inside. How do I do that? What? That's all it did is

1537
02:23:41,899 --> 02:23:51,219
close the door. It closed the... No bag. It just closes the door. It closed the window.

1538
02:23:56,309 --> 02:24:13,879
I thought that was it. I thought I was ready. I'm gonna be the ball. Let's go be the ball. Okay. I am

1539
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:25,059
ball. That's 2100 fucking points. That's worth it, right? 2100? That's a lot that I get. There's

1540
02:24:25,059 --> 02:24:41,670
nothing in here. There was nothing in there. Oh, it opened the gate. Fod watchers skip. No, no, no,

1541
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:49,049
no, no. I'll know if you skip. I'll know if you skip it. I'll draw it down. I'll know. I'll know

1542
02:24:49,049 --> 02:25:17,239
who did it. Fod watchers run. That's like the equivalent of, okay, how many times per minute

1543
02:25:17,799 --> 02:25:24,579
do you guys think that somebody types into Google? Does somebody know if I unfollow them?

1544
02:25:27,319 --> 02:25:33,209
Does somebody know if they see your... Does somebody know if you see their tweet? How many

1545
02:25:33,209 --> 02:25:49,690
times a second do you think that's typed into Google? If I have read receipts off,

1546
02:25:49,690 --> 02:26:06,760
will people still know I saw their text? Quick rewind.

1547
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:23,510
Oh, that gap looks big. Okay. I'm definitely not making that jump. How is anyone going to get

1548
02:26:23,510 --> 02:26:37,750
across there? New character? Oh, more robots. Looks impossible. Okay. Okay. I'll go get Sandy

1549
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:52,600
to help me out. Where's Sandy? I don't know where Sandy lives. Oh shit. I need to have watched the

1550
02:26:52,600 --> 02:27:15,000
show. No, I actually don't know. I know that Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward are neighbors.

1551
02:27:15,959 --> 02:27:29,459
I don't know where Sandy lives. I know that she's in a dome somewhere. Did she just get off the

1552
02:27:29,459 --> 02:27:45,620
bus? She just gets off the bus. Okay. Well, that makes it way easier. All right. Let's go jump to

1553
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:52,860
the top of these steps. Sandy can glide across the gap to the next rooftop by double jumping

1554
02:27:52,860 --> 02:28:20,790
and holding A. Nice. I don't think I'll ever not play with Sandy. Double jump and a glide? Oh wait.

1555
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:31,510
I love it. I love the jump too. Jump looks exactly like those... There's a toy. There's a toy. I don't

1556
02:28:31,510 --> 02:28:35,829
know what it is. What toy is this? It's like a little string and you pull the string up from the

1557
02:28:35,909 --> 02:28:40,069
top of the head and it goes... All the legs and arms come up and down. What am I talking about?

1558
02:28:40,069 --> 02:28:52,139
What is it? An old wooden toy. It's a toy that's like wood. It's a depression era toy. Yes. What

1559
02:28:52,139 --> 02:29:13,110
is it called? Called a barrel man. Are you lying? No, this is not... What the... This is not it. No.

1560
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:25,670
It's a wooden toy that has string and legs and arms move up. What is this thing? Jumping jack.

1561
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:41,690
There it is. Thank you. It's like a... Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It goes like this. Don't leave.

1562
02:29:43,930 --> 02:29:52,379
You're hovering over the X. Just stay. It's okay. All right. You're just like... You were about to

1563
02:29:52,379 --> 02:30:06,120
click and I stopped you. Just wait. Skip 10 seconds. Hey, what's up? Just want to make sure

1564
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:13,219
that you actually did what I told you to do. Now, if you want to be cool and we can be like,

1565
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:17,860
you know, but like a big community here, I'd like for you to skip an hour and 10 minutes

1566
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:34,540
and I'll see you there for a sacred surprise. Skip an hour and 10 minutes. It's going to be fun.

1567
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:52,600
What's that exact time though? It'll be 3... It'll be 3.42. 3.42. All right. Where am I going?

1568
02:30:54,040 --> 02:31:05,979
We can't skip when it's live. This isn't for you. This is for the Vod Watchers.

1569
02:31:13,639 --> 02:31:22,489
Right. Does she have something? Sandy can do a chop attack by pressing X. If you chop while in

1570
02:31:22,489 --> 02:31:41,340
the air, you will perform a karate kick. Okay. Cool. Wait, what? Sandy can lasso the object by

1571
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:48,940
pressing B. So, tutorial, what you're telling me is Sandy is the best character in the game.

1572
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:59,819
She just has every awesome move. Sandy can swing from a swing hook by pressing B.

1573
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:14,780
I don't like it. It didn't say hold B. It said press B. It said press B, not hold B.

1574
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:26,920
B. Press B, not, hey, hold it. It didn't say that. Now, what do I do now?

1575
02:32:27,799 --> 02:32:55,030
And she turned into a ball. Shit. Wait. Blow this up. That makes me so mad. I want to like

1576
02:32:55,030 --> 02:33:03,620
leave the level. Fuck. No, I can't leave the level. I think I just fucking glitched the game

1577
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:16,819
out to get that one. It's right over there, you baby. Is it? What? Dude, you just call me baby?

1578
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:46,659
What else can I get with this? It is right here. I need to get back up there. You enjoy halo.

1579
02:33:48,229 --> 02:33:57,350
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. All right. I'm paying attention now.

1580
02:33:57,350 --> 02:34:16,620
Everyone's yelling at me. Where's the trampoline? Remember, you're just crying. You're crying.

1581
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:51,159
Oddwatches, skip whole stream. How would you do that? The stream is sick. All right. We're back.

1582
02:34:51,719 --> 02:35:15,700
Which way is correct? Which is the right way? The stream is infected. So again, hold it. That's

1583
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:25,420
actually kind of fun. He's got it under control. Sandy can lasso a rope up at pressing B. Sandy's

1584
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:50,979
the best. Watch out, explodes. Good point now. Where do I go from here is the question.

1585
02:35:51,540 --> 02:36:10,309
We've got the whole area. Oh boy. There we are. Yes. This is a fake Sandy. I don't think it is.

1586
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:29,959
I think this is real. I will destroy this though. Just get out of here and I'll get one of these.

1587
02:36:33,530 --> 02:36:59,420
Five. Well, anything else I can do from here? I go into the tuba. Holy shit, you can.

1588
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:10,149
No, you can't. Oh, damn it. I thought you could. Honestly, that was cool. And Sandy's best

1589
02:37:10,149 --> 02:37:28,340
character in the whole game. So I've unlocked Sandy. You have to press R. I thought you'd win.

1590
02:37:36,219 --> 02:37:44,059
I need to have someone replace my old antenna with this shiny new one. So call cable company.

1591
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:50,299
Yes, sir. That fair antenna is shinier than a three dollar bill. Well, why don't you replace

1592
02:37:50,299 --> 02:37:59,299
it yourself? I'm not really much of a jumper. So what's jumping got to do with it? Because the

1593
02:37:59,379 --> 02:38:00,899
old antenna is up there.

1594
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:15,399
Which is gross, by the way. I just want to make sure I make my opinion on that very well heard.

1595
02:38:15,399 --> 02:38:20,040
The robots have blocked off that building and I can't do all those fancy moves you and Spongebob

1596
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:28,809
do to get across these gaps. All I can do is flex. Want to see? Great. So what are you going to do

1597
02:38:28,809 --> 02:38:36,219
with the old antenna? I fucking hate ice tea with tons of sugar. I hate it.

1598
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:49,909
There's a lot of sweet tea can get to a point where it's like syrup. It's not even a drink.

1599
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:55,610
Like you could pour sweet tea over pancakes and that would be OK. That's a lot.

1600
02:38:56,250 --> 02:39:13,129
Sandy may cross the large gas by double jumping and holding a. Yeah, I know.

1601
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:33,209
Or the candy bottom motor company. But I like ice tea. I like ice tea that should sweet with

1602
02:39:33,209 --> 02:39:39,479
sugar in it. Sweet tea is at a whole nother level. It's just it's just too much.

1603
02:39:46,489 --> 02:39:56,170
It's just killed that person. Swing. Hey, I can't. I'm trying to read swing from swing from sweet.

1604
02:39:59,079 --> 02:40:09,719
I know. I stopped saying that. I know how to do this. It's a funny cartoon.

1605
02:40:13,739 --> 02:40:33,110
Oh, what? Hold on. You're putting on Spongebob's underwear.

1606
02:40:39,659 --> 02:41:06,760
I don't know about that. Why does everything explode? Oh, almost fucked it up. But I'm there.

1607
02:41:07,959 --> 02:41:20,200
I like that guy. That's my favorite character in Spongebob. I think so.

1608
02:41:24,659 --> 02:41:33,350
Twenty one hundred dollars. That seems like a lot. What is going to open? Rebuild the bridge.

1609
02:41:36,549 --> 02:41:49,739
Oh, I have no. Holy shit, I almost missed it. Oh, what the fuck happened?

1610
02:42:06,569 --> 02:42:10,329
That guy just grabbed me. That was. Maybe there's no reason for that.

1611
02:42:11,129 --> 02:42:27,190
See those baits right there? That's bullshit. Just do it. Just kill me. How did I miss that?

1612
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:49,579
I don't know. I just picture somebody sitting at their computer right now like

1613
02:42:51,739 --> 02:43:06,379
like just laughing at me. Give me the fucking thing. What did I win? Did I get what I needed

1614
02:43:06,379 --> 02:43:26,680
to get? I didn't. I need to get the antenna. I get the box though, right? That was just for

1615
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:39,479
the bonus. Oh, well, did I miss a box? I don't think I did. Back where you started. Well,

1616
02:43:39,479 --> 02:44:00,709
at least I got a spatula. Oh, you can get hit in the air and you lose your jump.

1617
02:44:07,899 --> 02:44:16,860
They are laughing. I picture with like any of you in the same room. You're all just

1618
02:44:17,420 --> 02:44:20,940
fracking the fuck up after when I get hit by even when I get hit by an enemy.

1619
02:44:26,489 --> 02:44:30,090
I don't know why, but for some reason you guys are playing some like old fucked up stupid game

1620
02:44:30,090 --> 02:44:35,739
like trouble. I'm just on in the background and you catch it every now and then you guys just all

1621
02:44:35,739 --> 02:44:52,889
fucking start laughing your asses off and when it's a bad happens to me. Let's not screw this

1622
02:44:52,889 --> 02:45:13,500
up. Please. No, don't I don't need to do that. I just do it. You just go a different way.

1623
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:25,270
I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait. No, no, no, no. I know I'm at the crosswalk right now and I

1624
02:45:25,909 --> 02:45:30,709
I'm not taking that chance. No, I'm not going to win the hand. I got nine seconds. When the

1625
02:45:30,709 --> 02:45:35,270
hand starts popping up, I'm not fucking running. I'm just going to wait till the next cycle where

1626
02:45:35,270 --> 02:45:41,129
I can cross the crosswalk. Not going to happen. Then you start to go like, oh fuck, I got to get

1627
02:45:41,129 --> 02:45:52,760
over there quick as fast as I fucking can. See now I got a full time here. Man, I did it again.

1628
02:45:53,399 --> 02:46:03,049
What are you just fucking?

1629
02:46:04,139 --> 02:46:32,409
Better. The fuck am I? You're going to hit by a train. You were. I know I was here before,

1630
02:46:32,409 --> 02:46:47,500
but where's this bridge? I was getting rid of a bridge. Where's this? I got to get the antenna.

1631
02:46:48,950 --> 02:47:14,389
I got to go up higher than this. Exactly. I'm pretty good at it. I've got, I've got like 10

1632
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:48,100
years of experience pretending to be bad at video games. So come on. Yeah, but I wanted to see what

1633
02:47:48,100 --> 02:48:02,409
was over there. I want to see what was over there. Wait, can I get your ass? I can. I don't think I

1634
02:48:02,409 --> 02:48:11,059
can make that one though. So what? Just get your own underwear. I don't, I don't get that thing.

1635
02:48:11,059 --> 02:48:21,590
I don't understand that. This is really weird. Where is SpongeBob's underwear? Get, put on your

1636
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:38,790
own underwear. That just tried to tell me. Get across large gaps, lasso, and then glide.

1637
02:48:39,590 --> 02:49:13,770
The hell is it trying to say? Oh, I did it. Any more? Nope. Defeated. Sorry, I had to do it.

1638
02:49:15,530 --> 02:49:20,979
What does this do? What's the trampoline down? Is he going to jump on it? Come on, jump on it.

1639
02:49:20,979 --> 02:50:04,020
And Sandy sneak? Checkpoint. That's going to be an issue then. I can't even. That was the checkpoint

1640
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:13,049
from Cruisin' USA. Yeah, it was. You're incredibly perceptive. And just because you got that, I'll

1641
02:50:13,049 --> 02:50:24,540
give you my best intro. Cruisin' USA. Not very good, but I tried. Come on, better make good use

1642
02:50:24,540 --> 02:51:10,840
all these. That was wicked cringy. Don't talk shit to me. You can lasso the red ones. Can I?

1643
02:51:11,559 --> 02:51:18,899
Jerma cringe compilation. I, you know what? I wonder what that would actually look like.

1644
02:51:20,819 --> 02:51:27,639
You know what I really have to say about that? Here's what I actually have to say about that.

1645
02:51:29,799 --> 02:51:36,840
I think you'd probably get to like Jerma cringe compilation 60 before you ran out of clips. I'm

1646
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:59,059
being honest. And I have to be honest. Watch. Come back. Yeah. They would be scraping the barrel by

1647
02:51:59,059 --> 02:52:06,649
10. You know, thank you. That means a lot. That means that this, you don't think, wasn't prepared

1648
02:52:06,649 --> 02:52:19,450
for that. That means that there's only like six hours worth of cringe. Stop going on this trampoline.

1649
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:50,420
What would that even look like? I really want to know. Part of me wants to know what that looks

1650
02:52:50,420 --> 02:53:20,889
like. There's a lot to go through though. Go have people make cringe compilation videos of me and

1651
02:53:20,889 --> 02:53:26,950
watch them. I feel like that's levels of self-deprecation. I'm not sure I want to

1652
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:34,280
cross. Do you know what I mean? Like that's like, oh, hey guys, let's watch. Let's watch like the

1653
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:54,090
most cringy shitty things I've ever done. Isn't that funny? Maybe. So what is this box?

1654
02:53:55,190 --> 02:54:07,510
Oh, I'm going to be cringe night. Don't do that to yourself. No, I'm not going to do that to myself.

1655
02:54:07,510 --> 02:54:23,829
I don't want to know. Travel to the lighthouse, but to anything else I can do here. That's easy.

1656
02:54:23,829 --> 02:54:35,899
Just play the whole wow stream. Are you ready? Kids set. Oh, what? You can't say, are you ready?

1657
02:54:35,899 --> 02:55:06,979
Kids and not have the next thing be, I can't hear you that go shit. So this must be how you open up

1658
02:55:06,979 --> 02:55:34,969
the door. Isn't that hard? No fun. Game gets, or hits a huge difficulty spike after the real first

1659
02:55:34,969 --> 02:55:55,430
block. Didn't I fight the first boss already? I'm the first boss, the squid, but that was a mini

1660
02:55:55,510 --> 02:56:17,379
boss. Oh, out of here. How many more of these do I need? I need two more.

1661
02:56:22,969 --> 02:56:32,409
You on the other hand, I want you to explode, but I got a purple one in there too. I don't forget

1662
02:56:32,409 --> 02:56:37,479
the button. I just make it sure that I get this. I don't want to hit this button and teleport out

1663
02:56:38,040 --> 02:57:12,069
the button. Dude doesn't do anything. I feel like a new sponge. It was a sock.

1664
02:57:12,309 --> 02:57:28,979
Let's wait. What was there? Did I miss a sock? It was a trampoline. Oh shit. I hit it and then I

1665
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:32,420
didn't notice anything immediately. And I looked over chat and somebody said nothing. Two people

1666
02:57:32,420 --> 02:57:36,500
said like nothing, nothing. LOL. And I'm like, okay, it must be nothing. Two people said it out of

1667
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:55,930
9,000. Uh, let's go back to Sandy. How many, uh, I've got 16. I think I want to check out the other

1668
02:57:56,729 --> 02:58:25,319
area. There's two other areas I can go to now. Or should I go get the antenna for Larry the antenna?

1669
02:58:39,899 --> 02:58:59,659
I like jumping around. It's a lot of fun. It makes me feel happy. I would have just jumped into the

1670
02:58:59,659 --> 02:59:13,610
box. All right, Larry, SpongeBob dream levels are pog. I hope you get that far. All right. I

1671
02:59:13,610 --> 02:59:19,370
get Larry to the top, right? I can finally watch those reruns of the, but I already fixed it.

1672
02:59:20,170 --> 02:59:26,600
Nevermind. I already did it. Yeah. I'm going to let me try one of the other areas.

1673
02:59:27,319 --> 02:59:43,030
Dream levels are awesome. Okay. Kini bottom. Oh, look at that. You get, this is

1674
02:59:44,819 --> 03:00:12,819
SpongeBob's closet. Let's just go to SpongeBob's closet and go to sea needle. What's the one with

1675
03:00:12,819 --> 03:00:38,180
15? It's over here. Travel to the Poseidon. Okay. Cool. Lagoon or Poseidon. Oh yeah. Turn in the socks.

1676
03:00:42,219 --> 03:00:57,110
Here's your golden back scratcher. I don't speak Italian. Oh yeah. I got, I got lots of money.

1677
03:00:57,670 --> 03:01:04,469
This isn't money. So do you want to trade shiny objects for a golden spatula? Yeah. That's quality

1678
03:01:04,469 --> 03:01:20,920
craftsmanship. I do it again. So do you want to trade? Yes. I have less than a thousand bucks.

1679
03:01:21,559 --> 03:01:45,420
I wonder how many times you can do that. I'm going to the Poseidon. 126,000 for all those. Holy

1680
03:01:45,420 --> 03:02:22,600
shit. This is the real first boss. Oh shit. I got to sit up then. Whoa. Wait for the bounce.

1681
03:02:29,930 --> 03:02:35,770
Like that. And then in the head. I get it. I know what to do.

1682
03:02:36,729 --> 03:02:48,260
I don't, I don't get it. I don't know what to do. I don't understand. Oh, that's the bounce.

1683
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:55,700
But will he get the drop on the robot? That's the bounce. That's the bounce.

1684
03:02:57,459 --> 03:03:06,020
Get off my screen. Get off my screen you fucking like 10 sub stream labs notification. Get out of

1685
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:24,870
here. Oh, that was a good job. Bad execution. Cause I was trying to pay attention to the boss.

1686
03:03:26,229 --> 03:03:35,030
That was slowly slow to come out. Get out of here. You bad 10 sub notification. Oh, watch out for

1687
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:58,010
Sandy. I did get the drop. Do it again. I get it now. It's like the robots left itself vulnerable.

1688
03:03:58,090 --> 03:04:04,139
That's taking a beating out there. I wasn't even doing this thing.

1689
03:04:09,899 --> 03:04:36,229
Oh, phase two. Do I tag him in? Bounce and throw the head. What does that mean? Bounce and throw

1690
03:04:36,229 --> 03:04:46,139
the head. So I have to like just wait. Everybody's wearing his underwear.

1691
03:04:46,139 --> 03:05:04,969
Throw the head into, uh, into the electricity.

1692
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:15,879
Right back on her head. Just give it back.

1693
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:33,479
And there we go. Nice flying, uh, head thing move by Patrick.

1694
03:05:33,479 --> 03:05:42,260
There's a swole spongebob in the background. Where? Shit, there is. Oh wow.

1695
03:05:43,059 --> 03:05:53,690
That's losing its head. Now it's Sandy's turn. This is the last phase coming up.

1696
03:05:53,690 --> 03:06:03,000
I've never seen such an electrifying match. How does Jerma manage to read some comments?

1697
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:09,020
That's how Jerma manages to not know, uh, where he's standing half the time.

1698
03:06:09,659 --> 03:06:17,030
So Jerma gets to the same spot he's been to three times and doesn't remember he was there.

1699
03:06:26,950 --> 03:06:35,000
Wait. Oh, I got to hit you right in the chin. He's talking in third person again.

1700
03:06:35,000 --> 03:07:03,209
Mom, he's talking in third person again. Not the top bro. Not the top bro. Finally did it.

1701
03:07:28,870 --> 03:08:12,420
Boss defeated. What does it do? That's pretty pogchamp. He still says the whole thing.

1702
03:08:13,559 --> 03:08:14,920
He still says the whole thing.

1703
03:08:29,780 --> 03:08:32,659
Where are the subtitles? They're on. They're right here.

1704
03:08:55,110 --> 03:09:00,469
No, not really. I was waiting for someone to say it. Exactly. And as your non-friend,

1705
03:09:00,469 --> 03:09:05,590
I dropped like a few, I dropped 300 frames just real quick and I was waiting for a fiber,

1706
03:09:05,590 --> 03:09:17,540
like F fiber high. He's got fiber lab out loud. Tell you what I'm going to do for you. This way

1707
03:09:17,540 --> 03:09:22,260
you won't hurt yourself and you can just keep working on getting me into the jump bucket.

1708
03:09:23,059 --> 03:09:30,709
I already said, don't stop using a VPN. It's snake oil. You're the best non-friend,

1709
03:09:31,430 --> 03:09:35,270
don't you understand? I've committed to a point where it has to be real.

1710
03:09:35,989 --> 03:09:53,110
I've committed to a point where it needs to be real. Very cool. So that was just a single boss

1711
03:09:53,110 --> 03:10:01,239
fight, huh? Oh, wait, I, wait, I, this is where she lives. She's that close. I thought she lived

1712
03:10:01,239 --> 03:10:12,229
like in another city. Wait, this is blowing my mind. Sandy lived right here, like right down

1713
03:10:12,229 --> 03:10:28,569
the street. I thought she lived like 10 to 20 miles away. Holy shit. This isn't cannon.

1714
03:10:51,719 --> 03:11:03,819
Are you ready kids? Let's go. Oh no. He turned it from SpongeBob. Hold on. I don't want to lose.

1715
03:11:03,819 --> 03:11:09,260
I only have, that's a long time. Nevermind. I think as many jokes as you want, Jeremy.

1716
03:11:09,260 --> 03:11:19,180
Talking in third person again. Things he's talking to himself somehow. I don't know what

1717
03:11:19,180 --> 03:11:48,170
he's doing. It's been pretty long. Go for an oh, tartar sauce cloud.

1718
03:11:51,750 --> 03:12:00,649
Maybe when I get, maybe later. That was the easiest spatula of the whole game.

1719
03:12:01,450 --> 03:12:10,329
Wait, isn't this where the, I don't need it. Don't need it. I definitely don't need it.

1720
03:12:11,049 --> 03:12:15,370
He's sitting right here, right? He's like, I don't need it. I don't need it.

1721
03:12:19,159 --> 03:12:28,389
He freaks out. I don't know what happens after that. All I know is I've seen the GIF

1722
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:32,389
like a thousand times. I don't know what happens after that. I've never seen the episode.

1723
03:12:32,389 --> 03:12:45,610
SpongeBob's a cool little guy, Annie. Can I do anything else in here? Of course I've seen the

1724
03:12:45,610 --> 03:13:09,260
episode. Can I go actually in the tree? Let me teach you how to bowl a bubble. Press this button

1725
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:15,340
and you'll bowl a bubble that can knock down robots from a safe distance. Wow. Really? Remember

1726
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:21,020
though, the bubble ball only works on things that are close to the ground. Got it.

1727
03:13:21,819 --> 03:13:38,229
From a joke, it's 342, guys. I, I know what it was. 342. That's in like 30 minutes. Nice. That's

1728
03:13:38,229 --> 03:14:01,030
cool. Charging it goes, but yeah, it goes faster. 40 to go over here. I'm assuming that's probably

1729
03:14:01,030 --> 03:14:29,670
end game. Golden factuals to enter, to unlock. 30. Go to goo lagoon. It's cool.

1730
03:14:29,670 --> 03:14:32,809
All right. I'll go to goo lagoon. Well, wait, I want to, let me go,

1731
03:14:33,850 --> 03:14:43,219
let me go inside of this building. What is this? Oh shit. There's nothing like the smell of bubbles

1732
03:14:43,219 --> 03:14:58,500
in the morning. What did that do? There's a timer. Oh shit. Let's go. You're going to catch me with

1733
03:14:58,500 --> 03:15:07,559
that one. Didn't you? Yep. You almost did. Yeah. That's sunshine flashbacks for sure.

1734
03:15:08,120 --> 03:15:30,309
Let's go in the police station. Okay. Now give me, there's gotta be a spatula in every single

1735
03:15:30,309 --> 03:15:38,389
building. All right. It has to be. I think bottom most wanted it. Oh, it's, it's just, it's a,

1736
03:15:38,389 --> 03:16:15,799
it's a bestiary. Oh, these things. We'll get the golden underpants. I'll get it. Ready?

1737
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:24,020
Why is every spamming a link? First link spam. We're coming back. First actual link spam. What

1738
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:34,200
is it? This is, I'm intrigued. Hold on a second. This is first purple, like just huge wave of purple

1739
03:16:34,200 --> 03:16:59,639
links. That's pretty good. That's, that's worth showing. I think. Nice. Okay. Come on, let's get

1740
03:16:59,639 --> 03:17:07,639
this. Get this mouse off the screen. Okay. So like where's this golden underpants is up here.

1741
03:17:09,860 --> 03:17:15,860
Yeah, it is right here. Extra health slot. Can I get up there?

1742
03:17:18,420 --> 03:17:32,950
I just was able to break the game and go past that without 40. Oh, I got an extra health pot.

1743
03:17:34,309 --> 03:17:41,020
Why does it want me to turn into a ball here? I can't figure this part out.

1744
03:17:41,020 --> 03:17:59,020
I'm a quick show staking. I could go for one right now. Actually, not kidding for real.

1745
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:07,030
We don't do that stuff anymore, kid. We're retired. Is that the TV repairman?

1746
03:18:07,750 --> 03:18:16,170
No, it's that excited sponge kid again. Oh, are you sure he can't fix the TV?

1747
03:18:17,829 --> 03:18:25,110
Fake voice. Not real voice. Twidby, my greatest honor to come fix the TV.

1748
03:18:26,549 --> 03:18:31,909
I would have done that for 50 bucks. Hey, sponge kid, you really want to help out?

1749
03:18:32,870 --> 03:18:41,799
Okay, then. But lighten up a bit on the enthusiasm, huh? You're making my bowels act up.

1750
03:18:42,840 --> 03:18:49,479
We've got a link. Only one link for 10 minutes. Are you sure you're up to this task? Absolutely,

1751
03:18:49,479 --> 03:19:00,069
barnacle boy. Well, go to the couch to access the Mermalair. Wait, there's a whole Mermalair?

1752
03:19:14,389 --> 03:19:20,549
You're a fake fan. 10 minutes have not passed. No, it has not.

1753
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:36,500
Go over to the couch and we'll go to the mermaid lair. Wait, we can watch TV?

1754
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:40,500
Oh, I thought we could watch an episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

1755
03:19:48,739 --> 03:19:50,500
What's his shoe size? 13.

1756
03:20:12,170 --> 03:20:34,250
What the fuck are you watching, man? Enter the Mermalair. Yeah, it's everybody's dream to go to

1757
03:20:34,250 --> 03:21:03,350
the Mermalair. Wait, what's going on down here? This looks corrupting. All right, I'm gonna die.

1758
03:21:04,149 --> 03:21:13,540
I've already done it like twice. I don't need to do it again. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

1759
03:21:17,719 --> 03:21:21,319
You shouldn't sneak up on Mermaid Man like that. His heart's not so good.

1760
03:21:21,879 --> 03:21:26,200
Come to think of it, nothing on him is that good anymore. Sorry, Mermaid Man.

1761
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:30,840
It's just that I'm always so excited to see you two. Standing in your awesome presence gives me

1762
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:35,719
the chills of justice. See, I've got goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on my goosebumps on

1763
03:21:35,719 --> 03:21:42,360
my. All right, kid, knock it off. Just tell us what you want. What a great character. Well,

1764
03:21:42,360 --> 03:21:48,100
I really want a new pair of sunglasses. Patrick sat on my old ones. That's not what I meant.

1765
03:21:48,100 --> 03:22:00,889
Actually, it's a good thing you showed up, young sponge of goodness. It is. It is. A bunch of

1766
03:22:01,530 --> 03:22:11,290
evil robots have taken over the Mermalair security system. It's up to you to shut it down and stop

1767
03:22:11,290 --> 03:22:20,729
them. Well, why him? We're perfectly capable superheroes. Because it's Thursday and we have

1768
03:22:20,729 --> 03:22:29,159
a whole bunch of doctor's appointments. Fish sticks. I forgot. Go talk to the Mermalair computer

1769
03:22:29,159 --> 03:22:37,750
in the next room. She'll tell you what you need to do. Accept this awesome responsibility, Mermaid

1770
03:22:37,750 --> 03:22:50,059
Man. You won't be disappointed. To the doctor's office. Away. Did somebody just say LOL Bernie

1771
03:22:50,059 --> 03:23:11,930
Sanders? Why is every voice Bernie? That wasn't Bernie Sanders. That wasn't even close.

1772
03:23:13,930 --> 03:23:33,959
Oh, there's another Bernie. Everybody's not Bernie. Oh, I'm going to die. Bernie, LOL, you normie

1773
03:23:33,959 --> 03:23:47,000
loser. What the fuck is going on here? Wait, don't let me read this. Don't step on the red squares

1774
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:58,500
off the disco floor. Why not? Wait, hold on. Let me process. Let me just let me process.

1775
03:23:59,219 --> 03:24:23,000
Did you say that Bernie was normie? What? What? I'm trying to figure out what that means.

1776
03:24:41,899 --> 03:24:55,909
Get out of here. Got him back. You missed that one.

1777
03:25:10,629 --> 03:25:30,489
You're in such a shitty spot. Just get out of here. So bad. Why am I trying? No, you're right. I'm

1778
03:25:30,489 --> 03:25:35,940
going to let that one stick here because I'm trying to knock them back at him. Bounce them,

1779
03:25:35,940 --> 03:25:40,020
throw them back at him. And it worked a couple of times. So I was like, Oh, that's just what I'm

1780
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:55,639
supposed to do. So yeah, I don't, I don't. Yeah. Can I spin this? You can use bubble ball to turn

1781
03:25:55,639 --> 03:26:10,120
paddle wheels. Ball one side of this paddle to make a turn. So I'm making that up. Okay. He wants

1782
03:26:10,120 --> 03:26:37,129
me to go this way. Can I turn this on? Your chair is about to break. 15 minutes until it's funny.

1783
03:26:44,360 --> 03:26:52,620
This is going to be like a, oh, damn it. Shit. It's still possible. Is it though? No, it's not.

1784
03:26:53,899 --> 03:26:58,600
Fuck. Fuck. Important. This is very important. Seriously. This is the most important thing in

1785
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:01,959
the whole stream. We only have a few minutes to do this. I need somebody to go back to like,

1786
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:05,959
uh, I need somebody to go back to the first like fucking 40 minutes of the screen.

1787
03:27:06,920 --> 03:27:11,159
And I need something. I need to, I need to, I need something that I said that I can use this

1788
03:27:11,159 --> 03:27:15,399
like a puzzle for the Vaude watchers. When I say, Hey, welcome. You're paid Vaude watchers. Here you

1789
03:27:15,399 --> 03:27:24,020
are. Okay. I need you to go back and we need to get the secret code from one hour and 41 minutes.

1790
03:27:24,020 --> 03:27:32,120
Right. If you can decipher the code, meet me at four hours and 22 seconds. You know what I mean?

1791
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:36,600
Let's make like a fucking stupid game for the Vaude watchers. I need like a, a one line that

1792
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:48,309
we can, I can refer back to it. 342. I need an exact time period for this as well. I'm not clicking

1793
03:27:48,309 --> 03:27:57,829
that. It has to be something that was like at least two hours ago. Colgate thing. What was the

1794
03:27:57,829 --> 03:28:12,840
exact time for Colgate? Okay. Like if you can, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like go, go. Hey guys,

1795
03:28:12,920 --> 03:28:20,950
go back, go back to one hour in 42 minutes. And if you can find me a C a certain name

1796
03:28:23,540 --> 03:28:26,899
that will decipher that. No, it's gotta be, okay. Dave Colgate, right?

1797
03:28:28,620 --> 03:28:35,590
D is ABC. That's three. A is would be one. That's three, one shit. It doesn't work out.

1798
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:47,399
I need something like a, something that, uh, damn it. ABC D is four. D is four. D is not three.

1799
03:28:47,399 --> 03:28:59,879
Okay. That works. That's four, one. So V would be 20. So that's 22, four, four hours and 12

1800
03:28:59,879 --> 03:29:14,180
minutes. E, A, B, C, D, E, four hours, 10, 12 minutes and five seconds. Cause then four hours

1801
03:29:14,180 --> 03:29:24,139
and 12 minutes. It's like, Hey, you solve the puzzle. How can you say so much without saying

1802
03:29:24,139 --> 03:29:32,860
anything? Somebody, all right, let me pause this. I want the Dave Colgate to be the, I, what I tell

1803
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:38,010
them to go back to. And then when they get the Dave, I, they need to figure out the secret code

1804
03:29:38,649 --> 03:29:45,370
to find the timeframe to skip to. Cause the Dave would be the code would be the time in the Vaude.

1805
03:29:46,010 --> 03:29:59,899
That's what I'm saying. Yes. Dave equals the time like for the Vaude and like ABC D would be for

1806
03:29:59,899 --> 03:30:17,819
the fourth letter of the alphabet. So that's our four. You understand what I'm saying? Oh, wait,

1807
03:30:18,459 --> 03:30:23,020
the A would be one. How are you not getting the corresponding? What are you talking about?

1808
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:37,399
Yeah. Four, somebody got it. Four, one, two, two, five, four hours.

1809
03:30:43,559 --> 03:30:59,139
Okay. So in minutes and seconds, that's four, 12, 25. Yes. All right. Okay. Here's what was the

1810
03:30:59,139 --> 03:31:15,079
exact timeframe that I started talking about Dave Colgate. One, 14, 32. I need an exact time.

1811
03:31:29,299 --> 03:32:08,489
What is he doing here? What would have been worst joke 2020? It didn't even happen yet.

1812
03:32:09,370 --> 03:32:32,250
Can I blow this? I have to be Patrick for this. Where's the bus?

1813
03:32:54,389 --> 03:32:55,510
Actually really isn't that good.

1814
03:33:12,489 --> 03:33:13,370
No, I'm not doing it.

1815
03:33:13,370 --> 03:33:37,030
It was still putting in a fucking image. Hey, what the fuck? Oh, the 10 minute

1816
03:33:37,030 --> 03:33:45,700
cool down ended. Right. Right. Right. Right. Dave Colgate bit starts at 58 minutes in the Vaude.

1817
03:33:46,420 --> 03:34:39,239
Okay. Hold on. I have to beat this part. What the hell? It's not on a timer, right?

1818
03:34:39,239 --> 03:34:44,579
No. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1819
03:34:44,579 --> 03:34:53,290
wait. 5740 is exactly where it starts. All right. Steakums. This is okay. I'm going to show this

1820
03:34:53,290 --> 03:35:07,770
just because I want, I, why do I have to, why would I show this? I'm going to, but like,

1821
03:35:07,770 --> 03:35:15,860
why would I do this? By the way, good luck getting your Steakums to look like that and be like that.

1822
03:35:16,579 --> 03:35:34,600
It's very hard to do. Okay. Let's do it again. This one's going to be the hard one.

1823
03:35:34,600 --> 03:36:12,889
It's not that hard. That wasn't that hard. It's when you just walk. All right. Mermaid man. Now what?

1824
03:36:21,719 --> 03:36:26,440
Well, for a joke that sucks so bad, it seems like a whole lot of you can't wait for it to happen.

1825
03:36:26,440 --> 03:37:04,149
Give me that spec. Incoming worst joke of the year. You, no, stop. You're getting in my head.

1826
03:37:04,709 --> 03:37:27,850
Holy shit. This is a huge, this goes way up. I'm going to stick with SpongeBob.

1827
03:37:39,500 --> 03:37:44,540
There's nothing like the smell of bubbles in the morning. It smells like victory.

1828
03:37:45,340 --> 03:38:08,040
Just don't get knocked off. Should I've, I couldn't have stayed in Patrick. That

1829
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:37,110
isn't how that works. Wait, is there a dog? Why is it a dog? That guy was making dog sounds.

1830
03:38:37,110 --> 03:38:58,840
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell was that slide?

1831
03:38:58,840 --> 03:39:15,319
It is a slide. I got it. Got the purple one. Oh, whoa. Bridge activated. Nice.

1832
03:39:16,200 --> 03:39:38,870
I got the bridge active. I can destroy this. Whoa. Shit.

1833
03:39:38,870 --> 03:39:53,620
Move, move, move, move. Don't watch out for that. I don't want to get hit by that.

1834
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:59,479
I don't want to, I got to stand here for a second. I don't want to get the,

1835
03:39:59,479 --> 03:40:02,440
the dude's going to come over here and he's going to, Hey, what's going on? Vod watcher.

1836
03:40:03,780 --> 03:40:10,680
Welcome. You made it to the third step of the puzzle. Now the trickiest part of the entire game

1837
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:16,360
so far is you're going to have to go back, back to the beginning, at least somewhere in the first

1838
03:40:16,440 --> 03:40:23,479
hour. And you're going to need to find the name that was said. It was a first and last name that

1839
03:40:23,479 --> 03:40:30,440
was said. And once you figure that out, you're going to have to go to the timestamp that you

1840
03:40:30,440 --> 03:40:35,879
can decipher the code for the timestamp from that name. And if you can figure it out, you're going

1841
03:40:35,879 --> 03:40:55,379
to find yourself a prize. Good luck. Not going to give them the, you think I'm going to give them

1842
03:40:55,379 --> 03:41:03,379
the time? No. Telling them, Hey, go to, go to fifth. They might still be here. Get out of here.

1843
03:41:04,340 --> 03:41:09,620
Go do the puzzle. Don't stick around here. Don't go do the puzzle. Get the fuck out of here.

1844
03:41:13,319 --> 03:41:29,559
Oh, all right. If I say the exact time, then it defeats the purpose of the puzzle.

1845
03:41:37,829 --> 03:41:45,979
All right. So what if they're still here? I can't even say the time. I can't say the actual,

1846
03:41:45,979 --> 03:41:56,809
okay. I, wait, there's no more VODs, right? There's no more VOD chat anymore, right? There is.

1847
03:41:57,620 --> 03:42:25,579
Shit. Oh fuck. How do I, can I turn the chat off from VODs? VOD chat stopped a year ago. Wait,

1848
03:42:25,579 --> 03:42:45,049
but did it? I missed a button. Shit. No, it didn't. You just can't type in it anymore.

1849
03:42:53,750 --> 03:43:16,389
Delete the VOD. You can't even do anything. I just can the whole thing. Fuck it. It didn't work out.

1850
03:43:16,389 --> 03:43:25,770
Hey, by the way, the prize, I'm just going to scream in my room at the exact second.

1851
03:43:28,500 --> 03:43:32,260
I know the exact time. I'm going to just stand it back there. I'm just going to scream like into

1852
03:43:32,260 --> 03:43:54,340
the wall at the exact second that it happened. Okay. I didn't hit that. I thought I could make it

1853
03:43:54,340 --> 03:44:21,209
play copyrighted music. So the VOD gets me. Um, I can't go back to the stream from like an hour

1854
03:44:21,209 --> 03:44:27,610
ago and play copyrighted music. Oh, that was such a huge brain thing to do when we were talking

1855
03:44:27,610 --> 03:44:33,450
about it. God damn it. What a huge brain thing. I could have put on, I could have put on

1856
03:44:34,329 --> 03:44:48,920
that copyrighted music while we were talking about it. Oh well. The first one is here.

1857
03:44:52,760 --> 03:44:57,639
When you have pressed them all, you should return here to press the master shutdown button.

1858
03:44:57,719 --> 03:44:58,520
Just redo it.

1859
03:45:02,489 --> 03:45:06,809
Return here. Got it. Are you listening to me?

1860
03:45:08,809 --> 03:45:13,459
Listening. Got it. Well, at least the people in the archive channel can have fun.

1861
03:45:15,159 --> 03:45:33,319
Right. Really should have been paying attention to that. What that said. Can you say it again?

1862
03:45:34,360 --> 03:45:39,510
Press all of the security override buttons throughout the murmur. Okay.

1863
03:45:39,510 --> 03:45:49,079
Press all of them. Is there another one that I didn't get?

1864
03:45:49,719 --> 03:45:55,209
Press the master shutdown button to lower the bridge to the villain containment system.

1865
03:46:44,229 --> 03:46:48,629
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What is it? Give me the good one. Give me the one that everybody

1866
03:46:48,629 --> 03:46:58,069
wants me to click on. Give me the good one. I don't know. I don't think this is it.

1867
03:47:01,340 --> 03:47:04,780
I don't. I just clicked on one that I don't. I think that is wrong.

1868
03:47:05,579 --> 03:47:11,190
Jerma Patrick.

1869
03:47:15,270 --> 03:47:21,690
Okay. This is good. This is worth it. This is actually worth keeping on, by the way, for a while.

1870
03:47:22,409 --> 03:47:53,770
This is the wrong one. How could that be wrong? It's great. He's a both good.

1871
03:47:54,659 --> 03:48:27,479
Oh, did I see Jerma Patrick deep fake? You can't deep fake my face onto Patrick's face. That's

1872
03:48:27,479 --> 03:48:41,459
not how it works. You can't do that. Can somebody do it? Can somebody deep fake me onto Patrick?

1873
03:48:41,459 --> 03:49:02,520
Somebody has to try. Even if it looks like shit. You guys are just like adding people.

1874
03:49:03,079 --> 03:49:22,500
Do not underestimate the power of the chat. Yeah, that's right. Anytime you underestimate

1875
03:49:24,100 --> 03:49:40,870
chat, it comes back to bite you. Click on the actual Imgur link. Why am I Patrick?

1876
03:49:46,040 --> 03:50:33,379
I wonder. Patrick's a moron. That's what it is, right? Let's continue. Patrick is a fan favorite.

1877
03:50:34,020 --> 03:50:41,459
He's my fan favorite. Yes, I know. I love Patrick. He's my favorite character.

1878
03:51:03,370 --> 03:51:11,190
Before season four. After season four, it was Mrs. Puffs. No, that's not true. It was Mrs. Puffs

1879
03:51:11,190 --> 03:51:30,250
always. Mrs. Puffs always. Electrical grid? What's this?

1880
03:51:30,250 --> 03:51:31,610
It's like a spring breeze.

1881
03:51:43,340 --> 03:51:48,440
You know what I thought of recently? You know what was the greatest job on earth?

1882
03:51:49,399 --> 03:51:54,760
It had to have been the greatest job on earth. Is being the guy that played the rock and roll piano

1883
03:51:55,639 --> 03:52:04,659
way back in the day. Because you just had to mash like four keys at the same time over and over

1884
03:52:04,659 --> 03:52:29,340
again. Just go while somebody else went. I would have loved to do that job. And you get to stand

1885
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:37,459
up and you can just be like, you're like, everyone's cheering you on. And then you move a little bit to

1886
03:52:37,459 --> 03:52:49,299
the right. You got a big jacket on. There's like a bunch of flare all over it and shit. You look

1887
03:52:49,299 --> 03:53:18,920
awesome. I would have hammed that up like crazy. Did somebody just say that? I'm trying to read

1888
03:53:18,920 --> 03:53:43,979
fast and play. Let me say the DMT is kicking in. Oh, don't die. Wait this. Okay. Hold on.

1889
03:53:43,979 --> 03:54:03,270
He's shooting missiles. It's not fair. Did it hit me? Oh, whoa. Whoa. Oh, they knew I was going

1890
03:54:03,270 --> 03:54:44,260
for the underwear. Just get this. Wait, open it. Oh, I get to go up. Did I get the other

1891
03:54:44,260 --> 03:54:56,520
teleport box? Penis is showing. That's okay. The camera's not on. Whatever. I don't know why.

1892
03:54:57,879 --> 03:55:23,940
I want to go up there. Oh, there's spatula at the end of this. That better be.

1893
03:55:30,809 --> 03:55:51,860
I think that's the last of our friend's SpongeBob. By the way, don't fucking run or anything.

1894
03:55:55,370 --> 03:56:23,500
Sorry. Fuck. This is why I have my mic turned down. For those of you that are asking, why is

1895
03:56:23,500 --> 03:56:42,819
the stream always so low? Because anyways, before I had that little problem there,

1896
03:56:45,559 --> 03:56:53,129
I was going to say the last two streams have been like monster stream. There was like 15,

1897
03:56:53,129 --> 03:56:58,170
fucking thousand people at the other one. There was like at the peak here, there was like 9,

1898
03:56:58,170 --> 03:57:08,790
9,400, 9,500. That's crazy. This is just a huge amount of people have been hanging out

1899
03:57:08,790 --> 03:57:27,590
the last few streams. All right. Let me get this. Let me get this. Wait for the cycle.

1900
03:57:29,139 --> 03:58:17,479
That cycle. I just damage hit damage. No, I can't. It's all this for a sock. Oh, there we go.

1901
03:58:20,090 --> 03:58:47,030
Ooh, this is called rolling. Finally. All right. Okay. Okay. Spatula is right there.

1902
03:58:52,889 --> 03:58:57,959
Uh, I mean, let's go get that first.

1903
03:59:02,790 --> 03:59:12,979
Boy, there's, I see my eyes. Am I going to play chess? That's not going to happen ever.

1904
03:59:15,899 --> 03:59:21,940
I, I think the only time I've ever really played, I don't even know where the, how the characters

1905
03:59:21,940 --> 03:59:29,479
move. I know the pawns can move one or two spaces forward. I know that the horse can move in an L.

1906
03:59:30,040 --> 03:59:35,180
I don't even know how many spaces. I just know it's an L. I know that the,

1907
03:59:35,979 --> 03:59:43,940
the Bishop with the thing with the crown on it can move in all the way diagonally. And then I

1908
03:59:43,940 --> 03:59:53,319
know that they're the king and the queen. They can move any direction. I always just get the

1909
03:59:53,319 --> 03:59:58,200
queen out there and just get the queen killed. So I get, I lose every time. I just get so impatient

1910
03:59:58,200 --> 04:00:02,040
that I just know that the queen's like a super assassin, like really cool character to come out

1911
04:00:02,040 --> 04:00:07,239
with. And like, I just take the queen out all the time just to go like on like assassin missions.

1912
04:00:07,239 --> 04:00:14,819
And she just dies. I'm like, I'm sick of this. I don't want to move in an L. Where's the queen?

1913
04:00:15,780 --> 04:00:29,690
With a great big ball. Impatient. Yeah. I can't play chess. No way.

1914
04:00:44,809 --> 04:00:50,739
Here's how to win at chess. Call everyone who beats you a cheater. How do you cheat at chess?

1915
04:00:51,620 --> 04:01:00,860
You're like extra pieces in your pocket.

1916
04:01:10,260 --> 04:01:19,579
So this is like mouse trap, huh? Move the pieces of machinery along the track.

1917
04:01:20,139 --> 04:01:23,450
Well, this is going to be horrible. I can already tell. Let's see what happens.

1918
04:01:29,129 --> 04:01:52,459
Oh no. All right. So then it has to go. Okay. And then come on. Hurry up. How do I make this move?

1919
04:02:02,969 --> 04:02:11,979
He's smarter than a fifth grader. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.

1920
04:02:11,979 --> 04:02:16,659
I didn't even get a look at it all. This, I don't even know why these things all happen.

1921
04:02:17,299 --> 04:02:30,940
How do I get the hammer to move down? Wait, wait, hey, hey, how did that happen?

1922
04:02:30,940 --> 04:02:38,920
Did I just throw a ball at it? Oh, what the hell? Okay. And what does that do?

1923
04:02:39,719 --> 04:03:02,250
Oh, this thing's set up. All right. Let's go. Have you missed? How are you missing?

1924
04:03:03,049 --> 04:03:40,069
Get it! Blaming SpongeBob. Ready. Here it comes. Okay. Then it's going to get scooped up and then

1925
04:03:40,069 --> 04:03:46,500
it's going to get placed up there and then it wraps around. Okay. Scoop successful.

1926
04:03:51,290 --> 04:04:08,260
Now it's going to go around here and then end up down here. It's going to get scooped up there

1927
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:27,030
and then it's going up here. Okay. Then it goes that way. That's going fast.

1928
04:05:08,280 --> 04:05:18,819
It's exhausting pretending. Scoop it already. Come on, man. Oh, I'm going to have to do this again.

1929
04:05:19,540 --> 04:05:39,610
Come on. There's timing on. Where'd he go? Shit. I think I fucked it up again. Hey!

1930
04:05:42,969 --> 04:05:43,690
What the fuck?

1931
04:05:50,940 --> 04:06:07,020
Way too early. All right. It's to go around the whole damn thing.

1932
04:06:11,159 --> 04:06:42,219
What is it? Oh, that was dumb. What the hell happened? Yeah. What happened there? Whatever.

1933
04:06:42,219 --> 04:06:47,030
This is the one. I agree. I think this actually is the one.

1934
04:07:31,690 --> 04:08:20,629
Yeah, this is the one. Got it. Fuck. Okay. I thought the arrows were talking about like,

1935
04:08:20,629 --> 04:08:26,979
I like you like tilt this, tilt it. Well, look, you got to tilt it around and get it in the middle.

1936
04:08:26,979 --> 04:08:32,139
Those old stupid toys. I thought it was like tilt, tilt, tilt it around. You get it in the

1937
04:08:32,139 --> 04:08:54,069
middle. I didn't. Okay. Shit. I thought it was just like, oh, get it in the hole.

1938
04:08:55,030 --> 04:08:58,790
Didn't he say get it in that hole too? Can he say something like that? Like, oh,

1939
04:08:58,790 --> 04:09:28,170
make sure you get it in the hole. Can he say that? Congratulations. You've solved the puzzle.

1940
04:09:30,389 --> 04:09:37,290
It took a ton. Oh, no, wait for 12 or one, two to five. Right. All right.

1941
04:09:38,600 --> 04:09:44,200
Four, one, two, two, five. I thought it was four, one, one, two, five.

1942
04:10:00,100 --> 04:10:29,540
Imagine not solving it. Congratulations. You solved the puzzle. You did it. You did everything

1943
04:10:29,540 --> 04:10:59,750
possible and your prize. Congratulations. By the way, I just did that into my chair

1944
04:10:59,829 --> 04:11:17,559
and I've been sitting on this for four hours. I was like, I don't want to scream because that's

1945
04:11:17,559 --> 04:11:34,469
way too loud. I'm like, I got to muffle it somehow. Okay. I can't laugh this hard.

1946
04:11:36,760 --> 04:12:28,139
All right. I got to relax. Like hairs in my mouth. Ow. I have a dog.

1947
04:12:28,139 --> 04:12:46,540
I was thinking, do it into my hand. That won't muffle it enough. There's no pillow in here.

1948
04:12:46,540 --> 04:12:51,780
There's nothing in here. I have to like scream. There's like a cushion here. Oh my goodness.

1949
04:12:52,819 --> 04:13:07,239
What the fuck is wrong with me? I can't even talk about it.

1950
04:13:09,559 --> 04:13:38,389
Congratulations. You ate your own ass. Okay. We're going to pull this back. I'm going to,

1951
04:13:38,389 --> 04:13:45,500
I'm going to get control of the stream again. Where's the ball? I got to get, I got to get

1952
04:13:45,500 --> 04:14:10,069
under control. Come on. Have it not be, is that too early? Oh God. My whole body hurts right now.

1953
04:14:10,069 --> 04:14:39,579
That was just stupid. No, knock on this way. Come on. Did I do it? Blow air in it. I was holding,

1954
04:14:43,100 --> 04:14:50,040
I was trying to throw, I was trying to throw it in the air. I was trying to throw it in the air.

1955
04:15:00,020 --> 04:15:03,700
Hold on. I got to, I have to let go. I got to go like brush my teeth. I'm freaking out.

1956
04:15:07,260 --> 04:15:40,090
What happened? Dave Colgate. Come on, do it. You should use your brand new mouth shower.

1957
04:16:06,500 --> 04:16:15,879
Oh man. That was too early. That was too early. It was too early, right? Oh no.

1958
04:16:15,879 --> 04:16:46,059
I don't think he needs a hand. All right. All right. In the back here. Okay. Let it up.

1959
04:16:46,620 --> 04:17:16,899
Drop that fan. I swear to fucking God. I thought that was the I did it cut scene.

1960
04:17:17,540 --> 04:17:38,389
That wasn't the you did it cut scene. Chat's going to leave if you don't stop pretending.

1961
04:17:39,579 --> 04:17:56,149
What do you, did it go over? Hey, and some of you VOD watchers, I'll see you four hours and 24

1962
04:17:56,149 --> 04:18:33,059
minutes for an extra special surprise. I can't even fucking believe it. I can't believe it. I

1963
04:18:33,059 --> 04:18:40,170
can't believe it. What am I going to do? I can't fucking believe it. I can't believe it. It's not

1964
04:18:40,170 --> 04:18:46,170
hard. It's not hard. It's fucking easy. It's why did I say fucking like that? It's fucking easy.

1965
04:18:46,170 --> 04:18:58,139
No, it's easy. Just do it. It's not even hard. It's a simple puzzle. It's just a simple thing.

1966
04:18:58,139 --> 04:19:17,590
You just have to time it right. Like that's a lot of you guys right now. Just like, I'm just

1967
04:19:17,590 --> 04:20:34,600
going to sit down. Yep. He'll get it eventually. Oh, he did it. Now how's about giving old Mr.

1968
04:20:34,600 --> 04:20:42,520
Krabs that shiny gold. I'll give you a promotion. A promotion. Sure. You'll get a whole extra 10

1969
04:20:42,520 --> 04:20:48,920
seconds added to your break time. Oh, a whole extra 10 seconds added to your break time.

1970
04:20:50,680 --> 04:20:56,280
No, I'm sorry Mr. Krabs. As enticing as that sounds, I can't give this to you. I need every

1971
04:20:56,280 --> 04:21:02,920
golden spatula I can get. Mine was worse probably. I understand boy. I'll just dock 30 seconds from

1972
04:21:02,920 --> 04:21:14,780
your break time instead. That means I have a negative break. Thanks Mr. Krabs. That was just

1973
04:21:14,780 --> 04:21:30,229
for one spatula by the way. Oh, I'm so defeated. Mine is 20. What's going on here? Why are you guys

1974
04:21:30,229 --> 04:21:59,780
fucking with the algorithm? Why are you guys fucking with the algorithm? Why are you guys

1975
04:22:00,340 --> 04:22:10,809
welcome? You made it Vaude Watcher. Your secret prize is to go back to exactly

1976
04:22:13,350 --> 04:22:24,020
61 minutes and if you can tell me the name of the first letter that comes up at the first moment

1977
04:22:24,020 --> 04:22:31,190
that you hear the sound of me talking, you're gonna... I don't care. Just watch the rest of the

1978
04:22:31,190 --> 04:22:37,459
stream. Just watch the rest of the stream. I don't care anymore. It was fun until like

1979
04:22:38,020 --> 04:22:41,690
10 words into that sentence. Hope you had fun.

1980
04:22:50,489 --> 04:23:04,760
Where's my prize? Oh no, he hates us. Stop doing minus 20 you fucking with the algorithm.

1981
04:23:08,010 --> 04:23:16,489
Uh, what am I missing? What are you guys doing? Stop doing that. You're gonna break my computer.

1982
04:23:17,290 --> 04:23:36,680
Did I talk to the computer again? It was a joke in the game. Oh, well the joke in the game is

1983
04:23:36,680 --> 04:23:54,840
affecting me in real life. Press all of the security override buttons throughout the murmur layer,

1984
04:23:54,840 --> 04:24:11,850
then return here. So what the heck? What am I missing over that way? I missed a button. What?

1985
04:24:12,809 --> 04:24:27,579
Where? Probably up. All right, if you see a button, let me know. Please tell me. All right,

1986
04:24:27,579 --> 04:24:50,299
get all that and then over there. It's right there. Press that one. Whoa, there's an oyster.

1987
04:24:51,020 --> 04:25:01,459
I didn't have enough money to open this one. How many do I have? Oh, what did I spend all the money

1988
04:25:01,459 --> 04:25:32,139
on? It was on another clam. All right, let's just farm. We're gonna farm just for a minute.

1989
04:25:32,139 --> 04:26:00,840
Just for a minute. Just for a minute. Hey, VOD watchers, go watch Vine Compilations instead.

1990
04:26:01,719 --> 04:26:09,420
Why would you say that? You're putting my stream under Vine Compilations? Come on.

1991
04:26:10,219 --> 04:26:37,590
What the heck are you? Come on. Wow. Can I get up that? I feel like I can get up there.

1992
04:26:38,229 --> 04:26:54,040
How do I make that jump? I just said that the VOD watcher probably wouldn't see it unless you...

1993
04:26:54,040 --> 04:27:16,489
Yeah. Uh-oh, they started counting. This is extreme scenario. This is an extreme scenario.

1994
04:27:16,489 --> 04:27:21,989
Uh-oh, I might have to pull out. I might have to pull out fucking big guns here.

1995
04:27:22,549 --> 04:27:35,860
I might have to pull out the big guns. Wait, how do I get this? How do I make this jump? Like over

1996
04:27:35,860 --> 04:27:44,120
there? Damn. Do I have to be like Patrick or something? Somebody fatter or bigger?

1997
04:27:44,840 --> 04:28:00,309
I'm pulling like the light post or something? Or is that all the way up? Come on. I'm down that way.

1998
04:28:00,309 --> 04:28:18,469
Oh, happy new year guys. Yeah. I mean, that was a long time ago, but yeah, sure. Can Patrick do

1999
04:28:18,469 --> 04:28:38,979
anything here? That's not bad. Ooh. Oh shit. Okay. I want to get over there. Do I really need 2300

2000
04:28:39,540 --> 04:29:01,079
clams? I think I really actually need 2300 clams. And I like just somebody says skillshot the

2001
04:29:01,079 --> 04:29:21,020
bowling ball. Would I do that from all the way up here? Use the box? There's nothing like the smell

2002
04:29:21,020 --> 04:29:33,670
of bubbles in the morning. Smells like victory. Hold on. Hold on. What is this? New Lincoln chat.

2003

That it's a video. Oh, you wanna fight? You wanna fuck? God damn, don't fuck him up.

Oh, you, you really wanna fight. You wanna fuck, well you wanna fight. You wanna fuck?

2005
04:30:25,799 --> 04:30:37,899
Don't fuck him down. So you wanna fight? You wanna fuck. Don't get up.

exact moment not right now but probably soon but I pressed them on all the

2085
04:50:21,169 --> 04:50:28,599
security buttons now press the master shutdown button if you hurt yourself

2086
04:50:28,599 --> 04:50:34,939
screaming um I didn't scream that loud I like pushed it into the chair and I

2087
04:50:34,979 --> 04:50:53,889
went like I'm fine I did it what the hell does that mean it was the after

2088
04:50:53,889 --> 04:51:03,099
that is what the problem was was all the how that played out afterwards the

2089
04:51:03,099 --> 04:51:15,779
villain containment system is probably a boss

2090
04:51:31,150 --> 04:51:38,669
does mermaid man smell like sour milk yes yes I do oh no it looks like one of

2091
04:51:38,669 --> 04:51:42,029
the villains is broken yes

2092
04:51:50,520 --> 04:52:02,279
worse than that he's your arch enemy prawn did someone call oh I thought maybe

2093
04:52:02,279 --> 04:52:06,159
I was looking at superheroes but now I see it's just a couple of pieces of now

2094
04:52:06,759 --> 04:52:30,470
I do this shit all the time I don't get it I just throw a Kim used to go crazy

2095
04:52:30,470 --> 04:52:35,630
she used to hate when I did this I would just put all my clothes in the washing

2096
04:52:35,830 --> 04:52:42,110
that would just that didn't matter if they were I didn't care jeans like red

whites oh he's I thought he was huge but he was really big I tried the five

2100
04:53:36,860 --> 04:53:40,900
year old way to play the game now let's try the actual smart person old adult

2101
04:53:40,900 --> 04:53:46,020
person way to play this game because the six-year-old me would have done that and

2102
04:53:46,020 --> 04:54:19,900
would have turned it off this shield went down I think I thought I could go

2103
04:54:19,900 --> 04:54:53,270
in there and hit him oh man that's a shit spawn be honest

2104
04:54:53,270 --> 04:55:16,180
we're good

2105
04:55:27,569 --> 04:55:46,619
he's gonna spawn a shit load right no this game's pretty this is a fun game

2106
04:55:46,659 --> 04:55:57,099
you know what I think I might beat this game

2107
04:56:26,450 --> 04:56:40,340
you got to give me more than one can't just give me one thank you here you go

2108

barnacle boys a quest will line complete that was cool I like that area that was

2110
04:57:24,819 --> 04:57:43,799
fun purity tunnel I can just leave right all right let's go to go back to the hub

2111
04:57:43,840 --> 04:57:56,290
this is a good spot to stop is there is there like more than four or five hours

2112
04:57:56,290 --> 04:58:08,900
worth of stuff to do after as of right now yeah oh no I like it it's it's fun

2113
04:58:08,900 --> 04:58:15,979
it's fun just to hang out and just do the shit and just play it right here at

2114
04:58:15,979 --> 04:58:26,619
the halfway point yeah all right well I'll complete it next time there's also

2115
04:58:26,619 --> 04:58:30,340
multiplayer how do you have multiplayer in this game I hold on I'm not done I

2116
04:58:30,340 --> 04:58:37,380
want to go look these things I want to look at I know face cam I don't really

2117
04:58:37,380 --> 04:58:43,430
do face cam only sometimes when I'm feeling really cocky and confident

2118
04:58:43,430 --> 04:59:01,580
that's when you'll see it turned on fields this is blue lagoon right

2119
04:59:01,580 --> 04:59:13,110
somebody wanted me to all right we'll do that next I have 30 now when there's

2120
04:59:13,110 --> 04:59:24,669
something else yeah over here when naming a character Dave Colgate leads to

2121
04:59:24,669 --> 04:59:41,090
you leading dog ass hair weird yeah Sand Mountain all right he's look this

2122
04:59:41,090 --> 04:59:52,869
okay this is the one I want to do okay all right so here's the plan I'm gonna

2123
04:59:52,869 --> 05:00:00,580
give you guys the kind of next streaming days as you know I'm still trying to

2124
05:00:00,580 --> 05:00:07,549
ease back into streaming sitting here for more than four or five hours fuck me

2125
05:00:07,549 --> 05:00:14,250
up uncomfortable but there's some other things I'm gonna do too to help with

2126
05:00:14,250 --> 05:00:21,240
that I just got this desk like not even a year and a half ago and it's

2127
05:00:21,279 --> 05:00:27,729
unfortunate that I have to say this but sitting down sucks so I'm probably going

2128
05:00:27,729 --> 05:00:36,900
to just invest in a really really just good standing desk so that's something

2129
05:00:36,900 --> 05:00:43,240
I'm gonna do too eventually I can find something else somewhere else to put

2130
05:00:43,240 --> 05:00:54,529
this one I like this desk a lot and one that goes up and down yeah that's the

2131
05:00:54,529 --> 05:01:00,630
idea is like maybe I could have one that is I could sit down at it for a few

2132
05:01:00,630 --> 05:01:03,430
hours and then all right let's get them I got to get the fuck up and stand up

2133
05:01:03,430 --> 05:01:13,250
for like another couple hours stand-up comedy yeah so if you don't know I'll go

2134
05:01:13,250 --> 05:01:17,090
over this again just because I've only talked about it once so I as well talk

2135
05:01:17,090 --> 05:01:23,009
about it again I'm going back to the pre Vegas streams which is I'm only gonna be

2136
05:01:23,009 --> 05:01:28,669
live like three days a week and those streams are gonna be somewhere like this

2137
05:01:28,669 --> 05:01:35,049
around like five hours five ish four to six ish hours the end of the stream

2138
05:01:35,049 --> 05:01:40,240
wind down is going away we're not gonna do any bit readings at the end of the

2139
05:01:40,240 --> 05:01:45,880
streams anymore and it was a hard thing to do it was a hard thing to remove but

2140
05:01:45,880 --> 05:01:52,880
it means that I can sit here for as long as I can and long as I really want to

2141
05:01:52,880 --> 05:01:58,139
comfortably without needing to potentially add another hour or so to

2142
05:01:58,139 --> 05:02:06,819
stream to go over the bits and talk and hang out and stuff but that's sort of

2143
05:02:06,819 --> 05:02:09,939
the thought process there and it's probably going to be pretty permanent

2144
05:02:09,939 --> 05:02:14,849
because I've been gone for two months trying to get this figured out and this

2145
05:02:14,849 --> 05:02:19,770
could just be a longer term scenario where I have to just manage whatever is

2146
05:02:19,770 --> 05:02:24,540
going on I'm optimistic still though but there's something just random and stupid

2147
05:02:24,540 --> 05:02:28,740
that it's gonna be oh wow that's real fucking dumb huh it was that the whole

2148
05:02:28,740 --> 05:02:34,020
time here's how you fix it I'm still pretty optimistic about it so we'll see

2149
05:02:38,389 --> 05:02:44,569
but with that being said I'm going back to the kind of pre Vegas I almost said

2150
05:02:44,569 --> 05:02:52,569
pre Vegas arc a lot of you guys say that no going back to pre Vegas stream times

2151
05:02:52,569 --> 05:03:02,380
and lengths so I'll see you guys I will be back I'll see you guys on probably

2152
05:03:02,380 --> 05:03:08,520
probably the middle of next week either on Tuesday or Wednesday and at that point

2153
05:03:08,520 --> 05:03:12,849
I'm gonna try to do two days in a row I'm gonna try to do Wednesday and

2154
05:03:12,849 --> 05:03:20,119
Thursday in a row see how that plays out how to do maybe Wednesday Thursday

2155
05:03:20,119 --> 05:03:31,650
Saturday one day Thursday Sunday they'll see then I'll update the sus tomorrow

2156
05:03:31,650 --> 05:03:41,279
the next day I figure out which one's gonna be wins movie night yeah we'll

2157
05:03:41,279 --> 05:03:45,709
talk for a little bit streams are not just gonna turn off obviously they still

2158
05:03:45,709 --> 05:03:51,279
have the credits to do I don't do my mom gonna be reading bits or anything but

2159
05:03:51,279 --> 05:03:57,590
we are gonna hang out for about ten minutes or so don't worry so do that now

2160
05:03:57,590 --> 05:04:06,389
oh where's the music I got it there it is movie night is gonna end up being I

2161
05:04:06,389 --> 05:04:12,729
gotta come up like there's a lot of streams that are on the way here that I

2162
05:04:12,729 --> 05:04:19,009
really have to set hard dates for the DLC movie night is on Wednesday I'll

2163
05:04:19,009 --> 05:04:24,099
give you a hard date it's gonna be within the next ten days that's pretty

2164
05:04:24,099 --> 05:04:28,889
much a guarantee that it within the next like 10 to 15 days and then there's the

2165
05:04:28,889 --> 05:04:34,979
webcam stream there's FTK August is gonna be there's a lot of stuff going on

2166
05:04:34,979 --> 05:04:40,220
it'd be fun we're probably gonna have to break it down into more than

2167
05:04:40,220 --> 05:04:46,419
potentially two or even three nights because you guys have had months and

2168
05:04:46,419 --> 05:04:50,500
months and months to work on projects we're probably gonna have to put some

2169
05:04:50,500 --> 05:04:56,659
criteria in maybe some changes on like the second or third night maybe I don't

2170

2179
05:06:05,709 --> 05:06:11,950
people that were still subbed to the channel for the months that there was

2180
05:06:11,950 --> 05:06:25,259
nothing here that's even harder to believe so thanks that's it's incredible

2181
05:06:25,259 --> 05:06:29,700
to think about that that like I I I'm gonna try to use the money as best I can

2182
05:06:29,860 --> 05:06:37,889

05:15:26,900 --> 05:15:32,520

when the dudes talk with it was Jerma seven eight five what was that

2233
05:15:40,840 --> 05:15:49,599
Jerma seven nine five all right well if that person starts streaming you know you

2234
05:15:49,599 --> 05:15:55,439
know we talked about it anyways the it was supposed to be a

2235
05:15:55,439 --> 05:16:00,000
charity stream for the Boston Marathon it was gonna sponsor my buddies run in

2236
05:16:00,000 --> 05:16:03,900
the Boston Marathon it was a whole charity set up there was a whole page

2237
05:16:03,900 --> 05:16:09,680
that was ready and they canceled the marathon the Boston Marathon is has

2238
05:16:09,680 --> 05:16:16,869
been just canceled so it really was like oh I now like I'm gonna do another one

2239
05:16:16,869 --> 05:16:25,840
I do it maybe two of them just don't know it's all this was before obviously

2240
05:16:25,840 --> 05:16:36,119
COVID-19 you had this plan for a little while before that but that's kind of

2241
05:16:36,119 --> 05:16:41,159
what happened to that it was supposed to happen in September and that stream

2242
05:16:41,159 --> 05:16:53,560
was supposed to happen months ago but there will be another rumble promise

2243
05:16:53,560 --> 05:17:00,840
it's not like I don't think about it all the time so there are tons of ideas and

2244
05:17:00,840 --> 05:17:10,099
tons of things I want to do yeah I oh I yeah I pinky promise absolutely there's

2248
05:17:22,720 --> 05:17:36,080
unless you told me to wait until WWE 2k 21 I don't think I want to do it in one

2249
05:17:36,080 --> 05:17:43,220
of those games I think I really would go back painfully somehow they're like 2k

2250
05:17:43,220 --> 05:17:49,360
14 or maybe even stay on the current year that I'm on now where this a lot

2251
05:17:49,360 --> 05:17:56,909
of the characters already are as manned I refuse to buy that new 2k 20 whatever

2252
05:17:56,909 --> 05:18:05,930
the one that just came out this past year now I refuse to buy it shit no it

2253
05:18:05,930 --> 05:18:16,159
is it is shit 2k 14 is the best yeah now I know and the problem with 2k 14 is

2254
05:18:16,159 --> 05:18:23,139
just it takes so fucking long to do anything 2k 14 it just you'll make a

2255
05:18:23,139 --> 05:18:28,569
character you'll load up a character and you'll put a layer on them you'll put

2256
05:18:28,569 --> 05:18:35,459
two layers on them three layers on them and then the game starts to go for you

2257
05:18:35,459 --> 05:18:46,389
load a piece of clothing it's the worst I wish and this is so horrible that they

2258
05:18:46,389 --> 05:18:55,080
didn't do this it was so close 2k 14 just didn't make it to the ps4 they

2259
05:18:55,080 --> 05:19:02,439
waited to make that new 2k 15 right was the first one and if they had I wish

2260
05:19:02,439 --> 05:19:07,930
they just made 2k 14 the one for ps4 because it was really close right it was

2261
05:19:07,930 --> 05:19:24,779
