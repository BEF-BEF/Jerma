1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:11,279
It's been one minute. It's been one solitary minute. Sorry. I had to pee. My mic seems really fucking loud

2
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:30,109
Hold on. It's a loud mic. Why is it so loud? It's probably better. How's that? That's a good thing. It's good like that

3
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:39,200
It's good. I don't like being loud. It's scary. Peek the mic. I have a compressor on but no

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not peeking any mics. Not right now. We want to hear your beautiful voice. All right. I'm not supposed to be here

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:06,459
I'll be back. Just enjoy the intro. Okay. Well that tweet was not supposed to say that I

6
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,719
Started writing. I wrote mall making stream and then I put some words in front of it instead

7
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,439
That was gonna be like chilling making a mall, but now it just says chilling in my mall making stream

8
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,900
Well, I guess that's accurate

9
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,379
It's like two distinct thoughts. It's accurate though. The first response is what?

10
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm chilling in my mall making stream. That's easy to understand

11
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,989
That's fine

12
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,900
Anyways, hello. How you guys doing? Hope you had a good week and

13
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,939
We are back for the next few days

14
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,420
Next few days is gonna be a lot of grab bag stuff

15
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:59,920
There's the week after this one. We've got Halloween. Whole week of scary shit

16
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:12,560
Both VR and non VR. We're also gonna be going back to House Flipper for a night

17
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:22,770
That's not scary, but I got to play it because the VR mode is coming out at the end of this week

18
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,539
Finally gonna play saw 2

19
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,659
Yeah, you will finally see saw 2 on this channel

20
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:41,159
Next week. We got three or four VR scary games to play

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:54,360
Some of them are probably dogshit, but whatever we have some non VR games to play as well and chubby bunny. Yes

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,319
Chubby bunny is next week too. Why is that such a big announcement for everybody? You know what I mean?

23
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,939
Why is that such a big deal? Oh, we've also next week. We've got a big stream chubby bunny

24
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:19,300
Not that it's really not that cool. It's gonna be stupid. You're not even gonna think it's funny. It's so cool

25
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,069
It's the best dude

26
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,750
Well, I will tell you

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,349
I'm probably the only streamer on twitch that will have a chubby bunny segment of their stream. So

28
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,069
Gotta get those accolades right where I can get them

29
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:44,900
Wrong. No one has done chubby bunny on twitch. I'm almost certain of that who has done chubby bunny on twitch that oh, wow

30
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:56,430
Yeah, I'm no one has done chubby bunny on twitch. I don't believe you. No one has don't do it though

31
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,389
Oh now I know why nobody's done it. Now. I know why nobody wants to do it. This is dangerous

32
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm gonna be very I'm gonna have like a doctor in my room. No, no, no, no, no, no Jeremy. That's too many

33
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,060
You've done eight if you do nine your chance of dying goes up by eight percent per

34
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:22,420
Bunny you put in a marshmallow you put in there. I'm being audited by the IRS

35
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:38,430
Well, you fucking shouldn't have lied on your taxes. Holy shit and speaking of taxes 20 community subs from lag X

36
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,910
That's we're talking about taxes. Thanks. That's a lot of subs. Thanks for the 20 subs like an

37
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,509
ink cat gave five oh

38
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:59,899
Taxes but dude dude, how do you taxes on stream? No, that's like the

39
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Okay, I would rather

40
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,550
I would rather turn the webcam on and be 100% naked

41
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:13,139
No socks on either and have you do my taxes with me on stream

42
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,730
Like I'd rather do 20 jumping jacks

43
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:23,939
Completely fucking naked and have a camera over my shoulder while we do my taxes together

44
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,399
I

45
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,920
know dude

46
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:40,709
Like can I do the naked stream ten times like Satan pops up?

47
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,629
Jeremy you have two choices

48
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:49,069
You either do your taxes on stream or you're naked on camera for a stream

49
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,670
Can I do ten streams of being naked on camera instead? Oh

50
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,319
Yeah, yeah, I guess I would rather do that. Oh, okay

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,680
Right

52
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,800
Disappears

53
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Anyways today, we're gonna play the mall game. That's TOS. Yes, it is. I'm not gonna do that. These are hypotheticals

54
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,139
So this is gonna be like kind of a chill stream

55
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,319
I can't even say that because that always ends up being untrue. This stream is going to be very exciting

56
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,670
Okay, it's gonna be the most exciting stream you've ever been to there now the opposite can happen

57
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:43,689
This is a game where you build a mall and there's a bunch of little characters that go to the mall

58
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,730
You can build whatever kind of mall you want. It was recommended to me. So I was like, yeah, dude

59
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,430
Let's have like a just chill resident sleeper fucking pogchamp stream

60
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:09,139
Casino ink to know this is a lot less wild than casino ink. This is more like city skylines, but it's it

61
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,699
concentrated

62
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,819
Microscope on the mall aspect of city skylines and I think it's a little bit easier for somebody with a fucking

63
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:26,139
Dumb person brain like me. I'll show you and it's got like nice cute. Everyone just relax. It's gamer time

64
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,149
No, it's relaxing time

65
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:37,110
Relaxing time. I was trying to figure out what I want to do. I could either do normal

66
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:45,149
By the way already did the tutorial don't need it. Although there's probably some detailed stuff another interesting thing about this game

67
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,149
I don't know if this works, but

68
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,540
If it entered apparently like it's pulling people from twitch from this

69
00:07:52,540 --> 00:08:02,709
I don't know if you guys are gonna be in the game or something. I don't know. So there's four thousand

70
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:10,779
51 people in the chat. Maybe it's gonna be I don't know. I don't know how this works. Holy shit

71
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,639
We get to fuck up his ball. All right. Well right now this I think I might have okay looks good

72
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:27,750
I don't know. There's no like accept or submit button. Is it just pulling these names or K Andy Omega Lo

73
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,009
What?

74
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:41,450
4k Andy that's a shitload of people. We're in 4k Andy

75
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
It's a lot of people

76
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,559
That's tons of people. No, there's no there's only

77
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,779
35,000 people watching up football Stadium Andy. Is that what you guys say to like the top streamers on twitch?

78
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:12,710
Concert Andy only like a hundred thousand people here concert Andy. Okay, let's go. Look at that number fucking climbing

79
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,399
Forty six hundred, let's see what I've refreshed it again. Oh

80
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:27,820
All right, the audio broken it shouldn't be. All right, let's get let's go. Well, there you are. That's you. That's you

81
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:36,960
4.6 K Andy it's been ten minutes. Who cares? All right, so we have to make a mall now

82
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,759
Here's the question. Do you want me to play the video game or you know, and you know, there's mild rat infestations

83
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,389
Mild shoplifting. I don't know how that works. Would you want me just to start with money and just go for it?

84
00:09:51,389 --> 00:10:04,610
I I'm kind of know what I'm doing. Let's go for it. All right, let's go. Look if I can't do shit

85
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,529
If I'm like having a hard time

86
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,129
I'll just go to the standard mode and we'll have a fucking resident sleeper pogchamp stream

87
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:12,490
And that's what that means. It means it's like oh, this is kind of relaxing for like cool game though, dude

88
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:21,970
All right, $200,000. It's enough normal research. It's fine mild severe rat and I don't want to do that

89
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,840
That's probably gonna be such a pain in the ass

90
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:33,549
Wait staff have hunger and bladder needs that's the default. I don't know if I want to do that drop lifting normal

91
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,549
These are the people that I don't have so much play default

92
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:48,059
Severe severe severe severe. No, I'm just doing normal standard demands standard prices. Okay, here we go

93
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:55,299
All right. This is what we got to start with pretty tiny. This is our builder. Are they in twitch chat?

94
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:56,259
They are

95
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,700
Double zero trash man. Welcome. I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're like the first person therefore

96
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,000
You're the most important person. This is the most important person in the stream right now

97
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,590
Double zero trash man. Apparently you're 28. Is that real? Is it pulling the person's not here?

98
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,409
This is not a person they left the stream. Oh, man, it's too bad. It's too bad

99
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:29,820
They took that 4k Andy joke to heart. It's me. All right, let's see

100
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,179
All right, so this is what we got. Look at this shit. Do you see how fucking crazy this could be?

101
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:41,840
Let's all right. Let's do this right every mall I've ever been to pause the game. I don't yeah, it's paused

102
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,700
Every single mall I've ever been to always has to start out a certain way

103
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:55,950
I hate with a passion malls that have parking in the middle where they people have to walk out around

104
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,350
No, no, no parking in the fucking middle. It's a disaster

105
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,649
Parking in huge parking lots on the outside

106
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:08,220
I hate this shit when there's like a road that leads into the middle and there's like parking here and then like

107
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,799
Shops all around it. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't like that. I want big parking lot

108
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,440
Huge part of the mall big parking lot huge part of the mall big parking lot get those cars out of here

109
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:27,559
They're a distraction. Let's start that here. Okay road work 300 bucks for a road

110
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:41,679
What is this? Why is this little bill? Why is this like a little big center here? That's not a mall. This is all right

111
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:47,210
There's four parking spaces. This is like the maintenance person, right? Yeah, that'd be the builder

112
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:56,139
This is the builder hut they vape wait that they actually you they vape and they they can't and they've been continent

113
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:05,350
What why are these here can't resist e-cigarettes and bladder can't go below 50 can't resist diapers

114
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,899
Okay. Well, this is a got a little more interesting. All right, let's go. So I'm gonna say let's start our building here

115
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,450
We need a foundation. So I want the first store to be

116
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:27,480
Should I just do like a giant fucking box? Well, that's

117
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:39,340
$942,000 never mind. I cannot. Oh shit what I do. How much money do I have? I have 200 that fuck this mall sucks

118
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,200
It's gonna be tiny. How do you make a mall with 200 grain? You need like 200 million

119
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:50,600
All right. Well, it's gonna do a little store first. We'll expand right here. Ready? This is just be like a fucking CVS

120
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,309
27 fucking thousand dollars do what the hell is this shit? Okay now we're gonna we're gonna build that up

121
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:06,730
Build is gonna go double zero trash man. I didn't start building you pause the stream. I need to go pee

122
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:18,340
I'll be right back. No, the mall. Is it open? Yeah, you walls one Wendy's

123
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,559
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Wait, who's this? What? Who the fuck are you?

124
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,830
ASF max it very then there. Okay. This is you manage. Where did you come from?

125
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:41,720
It's fucking bugleberry. All right now. I know everyone's like, oh wow a mouse over and see where I am

126
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:53,159
There's gonna be like 5,000 people on the screen eventually like I can't do that. They're not here either. Not a real wait. Hold on

127
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,889
Okay, yeah, okay

128
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,200
6k Andy

129
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,230
What you just every every time we go up in numbers you just add an Andy after it

130
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:19,120
Alright, so that's it. We got that now we're gonna build we need to have so this is like anybody like a CVS

131
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,750
Foundation how much money do I have cuz you have to have a store room. I need a wall here do it

132
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:43,450
The fuck is going on that's too small build them build them. Oh, that's a foundation. Oops. Okay build it

133
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:54,759
What's what's good, what are they doing? Why do they just have like a panic in there? Oh, there's no door

134
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,480
There's no door. I need a door here. Alright staff door

135
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:08,940
I don't want anyone just going in here and then a little double door here. Okay, build that shit. There we go

136
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,240
Look at these two. Look at these two hard workers

137
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,009
Okay, this is like that can I put like a couch in here?

138
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:24,049
All right. Now I need I mean I need a door here staff door and then this is gonna be the storage room

139
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,049
So we need to assign that look I did the tutorial already like a fucking stupid idiot

140
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:32,419
So that you have every if it's a store it has to have storage

141
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:42,440
Otherwise, you can't stalk the shelves. It's kind of a tongue-twister. This is storage and this is the store. Well, hold on bathroom

142
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,919
Oh shit. Hold on. We need a I need a wall. You're good at video games

143
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:55,580
It's not even five minutes man fucking stupid idiot

144
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,139
Okay

Upcoming events back to school season. Oh shit. This is really a mall or is just a gas station

321
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,320
It's hold on a minute. I this is the entryway to the mall. You gotta start small

322
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:16,679
CVS closes at five. Why I build it now we're gonna do I need another store. I need something more specific

325
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,900
I do we just is just this is not even the mall. This is the city

326
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,969
Of course, there's a CVS like next to the mall just like how there's a movie theater right here, too

327
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:50,000
And yes, I am gonna make a movie theater here. All right, we need a huge parking lot

330
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:07,289
This is just like the little stop before you get to the mall. Here we go big big big ass parking lot

331
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:20,400
You cannot build two by two roadblocks. What are you talking about? Why wait? Why not? No money?

332
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,440
I have a hundred fifty five grand. This guy works all night. We can't get another worker

Uh-oh good thing you fixed it. Thank you. I got all night to figure this out. Oh shit

335
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:56,849
Okay, um, I don't I kind of messed that up a little new businesses people want a grocery store

336
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:03,170
Open a store with 50% of food to create a grocery store open a store with drugs creative pharmacy

337
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,570
Well, that's what this is supposed to be. What is this? This is a good

338
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,820
This is a gas station

339
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:20,380
This is not even a store. This store is horrible. It's what is in here. There is

340
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:28,900
Action figures sports balls tampons diapers and toilet paper. This is just a toilet paper store

341
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,039
That's so bad. It's a huge bathroom

342
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:44,090
Yeah, you go in here you use the toilets and then you buy the toilet paper right here on the diapers and stuff

343
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,489
It's just a big

344
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:48,599
Yeah, that's okay. I'll just rename it

345
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:57,389
Uh

346
00:42:57,389 --> 00:43:03,280
The big bathroom, how about that?

347
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,849
Toilet store. No, that's that's like a Steve Carell joke

348
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:18,320
Alright, so I need to figure out what the I pause this before I lose my mind

349
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:30,599
Alright, do you I do you guys see do you guys see like a chimpanzee with his arm up being like hey like like

00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:45,030
Do you see that you see it right? He's doing kind of like a look at me three legs

351
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:55,349
Okay. Well, let's focus on that. All right, the big bathroom that gross profit. Look at this

352
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:04,849
$297 it's a $99 net profit salaries and maintenance. Look at this shit. We're making money on that

353
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:11,219
All right. I need to do I need that. Okay research research research, right?

354
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:16,829

Well, these are gonna lead I don't where these gonna lead to and I delete roads

358
00:44:53,079 --> 00:45:08,150
Staff only parking. Oh that makes sense. You can't save this. Yes, I can let me just figure out what I want to do build

359
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:14,860
I'm gonna do what I was gonna do before. I need a I need to delete this shit remove road work. Here we go

360
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,760
Get rid of this stuff. I fucked it all up. I didn't I look I'm learning

361
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,730
Okay, that looks a little bit now. We're gonna go this is for here and for here

362
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:36,539
We're gonna make this road go this way. There we go. Check this out

363
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:58,199
I can't hope this the beat doesn't drop and it just stays like this. It's almost time to open

364
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:10,619
The workers will get to work now. We'll do customer parking. Check this out. Here we go. Oh, yeah

365
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,989
Now this is what I'm talking about. That's it. Now. This is what I'm talking about

366
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:23,179

371
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:16,369
That's a lot of money. That was a ton of money. I hope it was worth it

372
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:24,000
It's for extra long hot dog cars

373
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:32,239
That's for like a subway footlong. You're making the kind of mall you just talked about

No, but this is I know but this is not the mall. This is the beginning of the mall

375
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:45,980
Look, I can't just build the game mechanics make it so I can't just build like a thousand parking spaces

Still going on this. I may have done this. I may have made this a little too big

424
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,329
Okay, here we go

437
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:42,360
I'm thinking about here's all the parking. I get about this. The entrance is like right here, right?

438
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Entrance will be right here staff entrance will be back here. If you think about that, let's have a staff entrance

439
00:55:50,920 --> 00:56:00,070
Should I put this about like this?

440
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,260
Okay, that's one

441
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:18,599
Do I have to have a storage room for each store because these are all gonna be like little shops

442
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:23,099
Then oh, this is a bathroom

443
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
This is the bigger bathroom

444
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:39,280
No, okay the big bathroom the bigger bathroom and then the mall don't give me stupid ideas like that

445
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:53,860
I only have forty nine thousand dollars and then the biggest bathroom just have the back hole third be storage

446
00:56:53,860 --> 00:57:02,840
All right, that's probably a better idea. So like this just have the whole thing

466
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,800
Why doesn't how about this is just the grocery store and then I'll add a storage thing on the left

467
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,420
Then you can just go to this other stores in the grocery store

468
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:42,030
Like you're shopping around this would be sick actually like are you kidding me?

469
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:47,929
You have your shopping cart and you're going through the grocery store and there's like a Best Buy right over there

470
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:56,000
That'd be cool. You could just go in with your groceries and put like a TV in with your bread and eggs

471
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:03,449
My ice cream would melt. Well seems like we have a

Cold shit in your grocery shopping cart within five to ten minutes of getting in there. Is that the first thing you do?

477
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,360
That's that's not a good idea. That's horrible

478
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:40,400
If you get ground beef and you're in the grocery store for 40 minutes and then it's like what?

479
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,610
1020 plus maybe minutes 30 minutes to get home you have ground beef

Somebody just drop. You know what really would fucking pissed me off

737
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:40,460
More than anything whenever I would go to the grocery store is you would just walk down an aisle somewhere and there would just be a

738
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:45,539
Shattered salsa glass and salsa all over the ground. Did that happen to you guys at the grocery store ever?

739
01:40:45,819 --> 01:40:52,279
Like somebody would literally just drop and shatter like a glass salsa

740
01:40:52,720 --> 01:41:00,670
Like come on and nobody can go down that aisle if you want salsa like you like what are you gonna walk around it?

741
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:06,840
What if you step in it or juice? Yeah, like like an orange juice is just how does that even happen?

742
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:15,829
Most orange juices are sealed. How do you how does a full fucking orange juice like hit the ground and explode and go over five?

743
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:20,420

823
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:30,020
Wait, I guess that technically is

824
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:37,109

He had a bookstore online. How the fuck did that happen? Can we go over that real quick?

People really liked books. Yeah

1009
02:11:07,899 --> 02:11:12,539
do you guys ever feel like

1010
02:11:12,539 --> 02:11:15,020
It was a scenario where he was selling books

1011
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:17,180
and like

1012
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:19,609
Somebody just said hey, uh

1013
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:24,199
What if you delivered something else that wasn't books like pens?

1014
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:27,210
What are you talking about? Dave?

1015
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:32,250
Yeah, what if instead of books what if you did like pens and pencils and paper clips and stuff like office supplies?

1016
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:35,350
Dave that's fucking stupid

1017
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:38,390
Get the fuck out of my garage or wherever I started this business

1018

You guys think Dave ever got like any royalties for that?

1019
02:11:48,619 --> 02:11:52,300
And then like one day Jeff Bezos was sitting there. He's like, you know, god damn it. Yeah, I got yeah

02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:54,100
I don't have a pen on me

Where am I gonna get like a stack a bunch of pens? Am I gonna go to the office store?

02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,199
And then he like set it up and then he ordered the pens and he said how easy that was

1026
02:12:12,810 --> 02:12:14,810
Why is Jeff Bezos a surfer?

True anger. They got rid of the regular mc chicken. They just have spicy mc chicken now. What is that bullshit?

1187
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:47,879
It's just spicy mc chickens and the spicy chicken shit at fast food restaurants

02:29:56,950 --> 02:30:02,709
It's all the spicy chicken sandwiches at all these fast food restaurants. It's just like kind of hurts the back of your nose

1191
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:11,639
It's just like a back of your nose like weird spice flavor. It's just like powdered spicy. You know what I mean?

1192
02:30:11,639 --> 02:30:19,670
It's it's a powder. It definitely feels like granular spicy powder. Where's my regular mc chicken?

1193
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:26,340
I like spicy shit, but I don't like the powder spice

1194
02:30:28,059 --> 02:30:30,700

You just park your car walk through the grass and then you're at the frozen food section

1288
02:43:58,500 --> 02:43:59,940

1305
02:45:25,530 --> 02:45:29,770
We'll put alcohol in here and then eventually we'll just make it a bar. That sounds good to me

1306
02:45:30,329 --> 02:45:33,690
This is going to be essentials

Why is the wall all messed up? Um, I don't know. I think because they have to finish building this shit first

02:51:52,549 --> 02:51:54,940
That's a one out of a thousand chance

1347
02:51:54,940 --> 02:51:58,600
That's gonna be you

1348
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:02,440
And like I I didn't say you couldn't like run around and like grab like something and like throw it at him and try

1349
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:08,459
To get away and like dodge behind stuff. You can do that. He might not get you. He might just be like

1350
02:52:10,379 --> 02:52:16,219
And just go for the person over there still no talking we're talking 80 off everything in the whole store

1351
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:25,340
Come on, give me some more money. We gotta fill these parking spaces. Nobody wants anything in here. What do they want halloween?

1352
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:30,200
Candy and greeting cards. I can do that. Let's do that refill this candy and greeting cards

1353
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:33,979
This is all school supplies get this shit out of here

1354
02:52:33,979 --> 02:52:43,180
I was oh we need food shelves. Oh candy candy candy candy candy school supplies things is done

1355
02:52:48,409 --> 02:52:54,969
Although i'd wait outside until I saw somebody get grabbed and then I'd go in okay

1356
02:52:55,049 --> 02:52:58,059
So that's that's not a bad strategy

1357
02:52:58,059 --> 02:53:00,299
What if you pulled up there and you don't know when the last time you did it was?

1358
02:53:01,379 --> 02:53:03,860
Like what if you pulled up there and he's sitting there just looking down

1359
02:53:04,579 --> 02:53:06,760
How can you tell how do you know?

1360
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:09,899
When he did it you would just wait an hour

1361
02:53:10,139 --> 02:53:16,139
So you would sit there for a full hour and then when you saw him grab someone then you would go in

1362
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:26,469
So it's worth waiting a full hour in the parking lot. Just sit the way listen to talk radio

1363
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:33,670
Now with a parking lot is you can't sit in there for more than an hour

1364
02:53:35,209 --> 02:53:39,129
Every one of the parking spaces has like a meter on it and when you like pull in it's like

1365
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:48,729
It's like a 20 minute meter goes starts to counting down if you don't get the hell out of there

1366
02:53:48,729 --> 02:53:55,879
You gotta pull out within 20 minutes or his eyes just

1367
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:03,129
Go right over to your car and he just puts his hand up and he's like the hulk grabs you and like just

1368
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:10,299
Throws you into the atmosphere

1369
02:54:10,299 --> 02:54:14,620
Still going just park somewhere else and walk

1370
02:54:15,579 --> 02:54:16,540
Park, okay

1371
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:20,940
So if you park here you park it like over here and like camp out overnight and just with binoculars

1372
02:54:21,879 --> 02:54:25,559
And then just wait and see when he does it and then like what but it's good. What if it takes you

1373
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:28,920
It's gonna take you like 40 30 40 minutes to walk this far

1374
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:34,870
By the time you get here you have probably like 20 minutes to get the fuck out of there

1375
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:47,850
How far do you live from the store? I don't know. You might like live here. You might be like camped out here

1376
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:51,780
Play the video game

1377
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:55,299
Hey, i'll tell you when i'm ready to play the video game. All right, bro

1378
02:54:56,180 --> 02:55:03,379
Will you research the bar already so I can do this shit? Come on. You're at a profit for the day

1379
02:55:03,940 --> 02:55:07,450
Take a look at that

1380
02:55:07,450 --> 02:55:14,840
Mm-hmm. Everyone thought it was over. Everyone thought it was over when we hit that bottom. No, we're back

1381
02:55:15,239 --> 02:55:21,450
It doesn't take you 30 minutes to walk less than a mile. This is not less than a mile

1382
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:31,500
It's probably like five miles 53

1383
02:55:33,059 --> 02:55:38,260
Can I afford to put another two desks in here? What do you think? I think I can afford it

1384
02:55:38,739 --> 02:55:47,739
He's never walked in his life. He's a car pick him up

1385
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:57,719
Yeah, guys like my like feet are like so like

1386
02:55:58,340 --> 02:55:59,799
sensitive and soft

1387
02:55:59,799 --> 02:56:02,760
Because i've never walked I I just like have somebody pick me up

1388
02:56:03,239 --> 02:56:07,879
And like walk me to to a car carry me and like put me in the back seat

1389
02:56:07,879 --> 02:56:10,280
And then they drive me somewhere and then somebody puts me in a carriage

1390
02:56:10,969 --> 02:56:20,680
And they push me around the store and I pointed stuff if I like walked two or three steps and be like, ah, ah, yeah

1391
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:54,329
Somebody pick me up. I've never used them. I make them look no stop. Stop what just stop

1392
02:56:58,379 --> 02:57:10,069
Just stop get back in here and build that. All right, we need uh, another person in the way

1393
02:57:10,149 --> 02:57:12,950
We can do five. All right, five. We'll do five people in the office. I got money

1394
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:21,799
I need three people. No two more people in the office who we hire. You're digging yourself deeper

1395
02:57:24,709 --> 02:57:41,110
Why do you assume that I have a shovel in my hand because of the grave what minus two?

1396
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:49,049
Fuck you that sucked what i'm saying what what you assume that i'm like even aware of what i'm even talking about

1397
02:57:54,170 --> 02:57:57,850
That was that wasn't even a joke. That was me just like oh you're digging you're digging

1398
02:57:58,489 --> 02:58:00,649
Yourself deeper and i'm like why you think I got a shovel

1399
02:58:00,729 --> 02:58:06,549
No, that's like a rebuttal to like you think I what do you think I know what you're talking about is smart

1400
02:58:06,870 --> 02:58:20,620
It was very smart

1401
02:58:20,620 --> 02:58:29,750
All right, I gotta hire people. I can't keep up with this. Um, mute it. That's just mute the stream

1402
02:58:29,750 --> 02:58:45,079
That's how I do it 53. Okay hire. Uh, I need to assign this that would be good if I did that

1403
02:58:45,399 --> 02:58:58,549
I don't even like this game hire office worker

1404
02:59:06,020 --> 02:59:15,750
Actually, uh you you too

1405
02:59:17,930 --> 02:59:33,059
You're better. All right, that's that's a full office now. Thanks for breaking completely twitch. What happened? What happened twitch is messed up right now

1406
02:59:34,059 --> 02:59:48,379
Also, then I can finally convert this to a bar and we can have a grocery store bar guys

1407
02:59:48,459 --> 02:59:51,340
The stream is a lot better on mute. Try it out. It's really good. No, seriously

1408
02:59:51,579 --> 02:59:55,670
I kind of feel like it would be pretty shitty actually

1409
03:00:01,049 --> 03:00:05,639
All right, we got people working. This is going good

1410
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:08,760
17 more man hours and we can finally have a bar

1411
03:00:11,129 --> 03:00:14,809
Here's the question. Should I have the bar just be over here or should I make this the bar?

1412
03:00:15,290 --> 03:00:24,500
Oh, there's an annoying dickhead talking

1413
03:00:24,899 --> 03:00:30,260
Like in a separate building

1414
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:32,120
All right, we're gonna make it up here

1415
03:00:32,120 --> 03:01:47,059
Or like right here

1416
03:01:47,059 --> 03:04:27,180
That was low effort

1417
03:04:27,420 --> 03:04:30,360
High effort. Hey high effort

1418
03:04:35,190 --> 03:04:42,649
Oh, but apparently that's funnier than the I didn't bring a shovel thing. Let me write that down

1419
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:51,780
I don't like this patch of grass. He's still mad about it

1420
03:04:53,930 --> 03:05:06,309
All right bar, let's go 70 70 70 70 we're turning a profit every day

1421
03:05:06,870 --> 03:05:12,180
I need more customers. I need a bar

1422
03:05:12,739 --> 03:05:15,239
This dude's unclippable

1423
03:05:15,239 --> 03:05:19,340
Are you sure?

1424
03:05:21,190 --> 03:05:42,379
Somebody just wrote good one

1425
03:05:42,459 --> 03:05:51,209
Uh, yeah, I know that was pretty bad hurry up and research this shit. I want to make a bar. Oh, come on really

1426
03:05:51,690 --> 03:05:55,299
300 bucks though. That's not bad

1427
03:05:55,299 --> 03:06:01,299
And then i'm gonna do night hours because then the bar can stay open 24 7, right?

1428
03:06:01,620 --> 03:06:15,639
I'm not gonna spend any money. I'm just gonna save it. Why are your employees in a broom closet?

1429
03:06:17,370 --> 03:06:25,079
Um, no, this is the staff entryway they come in here

1430
03:06:25,559 --> 03:06:27,559
I guess this is kind of like the little like

1431
03:06:28,090 --> 03:06:33,020
Room to get like and then put the hazmat suits on or they go through the thing

1432
03:06:33,579 --> 03:06:37,979
What's that? What's that room called?

1433
03:06:38,040 --> 03:06:50,059
D decontamination room, right staff solitary confinement. No, it's it's just it's like the staff entrance and look

1434
03:06:50,059 --> 03:07:00,379
It could be a little bigger. Yeah, that's an among us reference. That wasn't it was I didn't make that you did

1435
03:07:00,940 --> 03:07:12,600
It's an airlock. There you go airlock. I'm not spending any money. All right, let's start the new day

1436
03:07:13,079 --> 03:07:22,649
We'll get the bar here and then i'm gonna go this way with the bar minus two the person that said among us not me

1437
03:07:26,729 --> 03:07:34,620
Minus two worst stream. I don't believe that. I'm sorry. You can't just say it. It's the worst stream

1438
03:07:44,379 --> 03:07:59,799
I'm having fun. I don't know about you guys. I'm having a good time. I like my grocery store lots of demand lots of money

1439
03:07:59,959 --> 03:08:13,799
Coming in 96. Here we go. There you go bar. Let's go right over here. How big should a bar be?

1440
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:22,090
Bars, not that huge are they they're not massive. They're not like this. That's that's how I don't know man

1441
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:24,090
That's a lot of money. I don't have the money to do that

1442
03:08:28,569 --> 03:08:31,290
I'm gonna run out of capital if I do that. I don't this is not a smart idea

1443
03:08:31,610 --> 03:08:45,350
I don't have enough money do something already. What the fuck? I this is like a sim slow sim game

1444
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:49,379
All right. I'm gonna do this

33 000

1446
03:08:50,840 --> 03:08:52,680
I hope it's worth it

1447
03:08:52,680 --> 03:08:54,760
After this, I can't spend any money. We have to just watch

03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:47,690
Way better than it was before

1665
03:46:47,690 --> 03:46:51,780

1666
03:46:52,739 --> 03:46:54,309

Drugstore bookstore bowling alley, there's so many alerts customers are leaving the center because there are no restrooms

1668
03:47:02,489 --> 03:47:04,920

1676
03:48:28,149 --> 03:48:30,950
I'm running low on cash, but I should be fine now. We're gonna coast

1677
03:48:33,819 --> 03:48:38,059

Plenty of stuff here shoes shoes are made of the leather you can eat everything here. This is the worst mall

1692
03:50:13,219 --> 03:50:16,739
It's it starts slowly and then you build up your empire

1693
03:50:20,500 --> 03:50:22,500
I'm gonna turn this into like a shoe store

1694
03:50:22,899 --> 03:50:28,329
Like I only had two hundred thousand dollars. All right, I had a small I had a small loan of two hundred thousand dollars

1695
03:50:30,709 --> 03:50:36,389
It's that it it's doing it's done. Okay, that's how you know, the stream is really gone off the rails

1696
03:50:36,950 --> 03:50:47,540

Like a quarter of a billion people turned in to jimmy kimmel every afternoon when he's alive

1704
03:51:42,200 --> 03:51:59,129
Okay, so he's doing something right, isn't he? All right. I'm just gonna look at I got 18 grand. All right, we're gonna coast

1708
03:52:15,739 --> 03:52:17,739
He has more viewers than you

1709
03:52:17,739 --> 03:52:19,020
Yeah

1710
03:52:19,020 --> 03:52:20,459
Yes. Yes

1711
03:52:20,459 --> 03:52:26,000
Jimmy kimmel has more of a larger audience than germa 985

1712
03:52:27,399 --> 03:52:31,079
Yes, that is accurate by probably a few million people

1713
03:52:34,840 --> 03:52:37,239
Oh mega love these he's a nobody

1714
03:52:39,530 --> 03:52:42,090
You know in the grand scheme of things guys, yeah

1715
03:52:45,930 --> 03:52:47,930
I'm not like jimmy kimmel

1716
03:52:51,290 --> 03:52:54,809
yet, not yet

1717
03:52:54,809 --> 03:53:00,250
Let's see

1718
03:53:00,250 --> 03:53:05,299
Holy shit, man. Look at all this money. I need another I need more cashiers. How slow are these cashiers?

1719
03:53:06,979 --> 03:53:11,500
Not bad. I think they level up. I need another I need more checkouts

1720
03:53:12,870 --> 03:53:15,620
This is naughty. This is bad

1721
03:53:26,600 --> 03:53:33,139
Okay, is it weird that I want to just build a checkout counter here with like five checkouts

1722
03:53:33,700 --> 03:53:43,690
Connected to the same store essentials. So then they have to walk across the street and check out there's no more room

1723
03:53:43,770 --> 03:53:45,819
It's surrounded by roads

1724
03:53:45,819 --> 03:53:47,819
I guess I could take some of this out and put it here

1725
03:53:48,540 --> 03:53:57,100
Our is really not doing that. Well, i'm not happy with the performance here

1726
03:53:57,739 --> 03:54:02,979
Nobody's coming in to drink

1727
03:54:02,979 --> 03:54:22,860
All right. We're okay. We're doing all right almost time to start the bookstore profits. Not bad. What do we got?

1728
03:54:23,420 --> 03:54:28,329
People want to go see major movie release. Fuck. It's too many things

1729
03:54:30,299 --> 03:54:34,059
Almost have enough for books when that's done. We're doing books. How many people will work here?

1730
03:54:35,770 --> 03:54:39,989
Is there all right?

1731
03:54:39,989 --> 03:54:45,819
Parking lot's getting a little full

1732
03:54:45,819 --> 03:54:47,819
Hope you don't plan on becoming an architect

1733
03:54:48,309 --> 03:54:51,510
No, i'm 35. I don't think that's a career choice. I'm gonna start now

1734
03:54:52,459 --> 03:54:58,149
I don't think i'm gonna just go to like 10 years of architect school. I don't think so

1735
03:55:00,139 --> 03:55:02,139
Not something I was very good at anyways

1736
03:55:02,299 --> 03:55:09,989
So it's already something I know i'm not very good at and I have to go to a lot of school for that

1737
03:55:10,389 --> 03:55:12,840
It would be 45 or so when I started

1738
03:55:13,639 --> 03:55:15,610
Maybe 50

1739
03:55:15,610 --> 03:55:19,610
I'd work on maybe one or two major projects and get fired from them because I screwed something up

1740
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:22,940
52 get fired. Okay

1741
03:55:22,940 --> 03:55:36,680
I don't know if I want to do that camel has 2.2 million viewers. You have 1.1 million. No

1742
03:55:37,319 --> 03:55:46,739
That's not how that works

1743
03:55:46,739 --> 03:55:49,700
You didn't want to have an enclosed mall with parking. Yeah, I did

1744
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:54,440
I wanted it to be parking this huge parking lot around it and then everything inside

1745
03:55:54,920 --> 03:55:58,940
And then like we got a bar over here, but that's not I don't even own this

1746
03:56:01,079 --> 03:56:03,079
Big money today. Come on

1747
03:56:03,719 --> 03:56:06,170
growth more growth

1748
03:56:06,170 --> 03:56:14,760
Growth growth growth don't let these people leave without paying come on. Bring them up. Don't close the door

1749
03:56:15,399 --> 03:56:17,639
Close the door lock the door lock the door

1750
03:56:20,059 --> 03:56:27,000
That's so much product that would just let them go for free. How could you be angry?

1751
03:56:27,799 --> 03:56:32,200
Imagine being that angry and getting out of here with like fucking 180 dollars worth of shit for free

1752
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:50,250
Why are you so mad about that? All right, we still grew almost ready for the bookstore. I need another cashier

1753
03:56:51,770 --> 03:56:53,530
I'll put it right here

1754
03:56:53,530 --> 03:56:56,649
That's more that's another employee though. Can I afford that?

1755
03:56:57,290 --> 03:57:01,620
Let's move some stuff around

1756
03:57:01,620 --> 03:57:03,620
All right, move some shit around here

1757
03:57:04,219 --> 03:57:10,219
This is going up. We need to really reorganize this place. This place sucks the complete reorganization of this place

1758
03:57:15,420 --> 03:57:17,420
M move up here

1759
03:57:18,020 --> 03:57:19,420
move

1760
03:57:19,420 --> 03:57:23,180
Here move here move it put it right here

1761
03:57:23,979 --> 03:57:33,450
A little off. I hate it, but it's okay

1762
03:57:34,010 --> 03:57:37,479
This is gonna be plenty of room for checkout counter

1763
03:57:48,299 --> 03:57:49,979
That one little thing

1764
03:57:49,979 --> 03:58:07,500
It's all right. Don't matter. Let's do that first so I can look at what it looks like

1765
03:58:08,059 --> 03:58:21,129
Yeah, you gotta move this stuff I already said make it all vertical, please i'm begging you

1766
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:46,459
All even how vertical this is so much cleaner you do all your shopping here

1767
03:58:46,780 --> 03:58:49,819
And then we'll do some checkout line. This is gonna be so much more efficient

1768
03:58:52,149 --> 03:59:03,799
Make it symmetrical. I don't know what to do with this guy. I do I can't make it symmetrical doesn't matter

1769
03:59:05,420 --> 03:59:09,340
This down here. This is like the checkout line people in the checkout line can kind of browse

1770
03:59:12,200 --> 03:59:19,559
Need more room though check out that

1771
03:59:20,680 --> 03:59:22,680
Uh, no put this

1772
03:59:23,319 --> 03:59:27,719
Over here. No, no, no, no idiot. That's where the other checkout counter is gonna go

1773
03:59:28,840 --> 03:59:30,280
You dumb

1774
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:33,799
You're not even smart like me

1775
03:59:33,799 --> 03:59:36,360
Okay, then this can we just wish up with these?

1776
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:44,010
Remember, this isn't a mall

1777
03:59:44,010 --> 03:59:46,200
Okay

1778
03:59:46,200 --> 03:59:48,200
When a bookstore gets opened here

1779
03:59:48,700 --> 03:59:52,219
It's gonna be a mall. You'll have a grocery store and booze

1780
03:59:52,840 --> 03:59:57,659
Emporium a bar and a bookstore. That's like a strip mall

1781
03:59:58,299 --> 04:00:01,899
All I just the only thing I need here is I need a sub shop in a verizon store

1782
04:00:02,540 --> 04:00:04,540
And then what would you call it? That's a mall

1783
04:00:04,620 --> 04:00:12,549
The bar that opens at 10 in the morning

1784
04:00:12,709 --> 04:00:17,829
Just make it a walmart you redditor

1785
04:00:18,309 --> 04:00:25,049
This is a bunch of storefronts. Yeah, you park your car and you can like go into the verizon store

1786
04:00:25,690 --> 04:00:27,690
And then you can go into the sub shop

1787
04:00:28,860 --> 04:00:31,579
and then you can like go into the grocery store get some stuff and you can just

1788
04:00:31,979 --> 04:00:36,059

1790
04:00:39,719 --> 04:00:41,479
And like well, no not like that

1791
04:00:41,559 --> 04:00:45,159
I mean like in a to-go glass like take one of these and then like bring it home

1792
04:00:45,159 --> 04:00:47,159
But you don't even have to why is the bar even here?

1793
04:00:53,020 --> 04:00:55,420
You can just buy alcohol here. Why is this here?

1794
04:00:55,979 --> 04:01:01,100
If I sell alcohol here

1795
04:01:02,010 --> 04:01:04,010
Why are you gonna go over here to buy alcohol?

1796
04:01:12,389 --> 04:01:15,030
You don't go. Hey, i'll pick up a couple bottles of wine

1797
04:01:18,010 --> 04:01:20,809
Hello, sir. I'll take a bottle of wine to go, please

1798
04:01:21,370 --> 04:01:23,579

1799
04:01:23,579 --> 04:01:26,139
Oh, by the way, here's sixty dollars

1800
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:35,899
It was twelve over there in the grocery store. Why is there a bar here?

1801
04:01:42,920 --> 04:01:46,760
But you can drink at the bar

1802
04:01:46,840 --> 04:01:54,920
Yeah, I guess you know the people sit at bars. I know you can sit at a bar, but what?

1803
04:01:55,479 --> 04:02:04,969
It's for the atmosphere. This person no parking allowed here. What are you doing? Oh, no, that's a staff member. Okay

1804
04:02:05,370 --> 04:02:15,530
All right. What was I doing moving this get rid of this fucking trash. The trash is fucking this all up

1805
04:02:15,690 --> 04:02:25,780
Why is that so off? Oh, it's backwards

1806
04:02:33,909 --> 04:02:47,000
Okay, no one wants to drink at a shitty bar. That's not true. I'm really sorry to tell you but that is completely inaccurate

1807
04:02:47,159 --> 04:02:56,250
How would you know you guys don't think i've been to like a bunch of you guys?

1808

04:03:34,120 --> 04:03:57,159
Oh bingo. That's probably enough for now. I need two more cashiers man. That's money. I don't want to spend what's going on

1818
04:04:26,969 --> 04:04:31,430

Okay

1834
04:07:09,030 --> 04:07:14,790
So if you went up to like a professional athlete that was about to go up to to hit at the plate a baseball player

1835
04:07:15,530 --> 04:07:20,090
And you said hey, you're the home run next pitch. They're gonna be like I

1836
04:07:21,219 --> 04:07:22,899
I'm gonna try

1837
04:07:22,899 --> 04:07:30,040
Do you better hit a home run on the next pitch and then they swing and they miss hey

1838
04:07:30,840 --> 04:07:35,110
You were supposed to hit a home run on the next pitch. I told you man

1839
04:07:35,190 --> 04:07:38,229
I hit a home run like once every three games, dude

1840
04:07:39,190 --> 04:07:42,790
I can I can just do it. I can't just hit a fucking home run when I feel like it

1841
04:07:44,520 --> 04:07:45,780
Yeah

1842
04:07:45,780 --> 04:07:47,379
Well, guess who?

1843
04:07:47,379 --> 04:07:52,940
Mo von could move on hasn't played baseball in like 20 years, man

1844
04:07:53,979 --> 04:07:55,979

Hey, jimmy kimmel swallowed five eggs on camera last night. Why didn't you do chubby bunny to one up them?

1851
04:08:54,760 --> 04:08:58,709
You got a low batting average and i've said this before

1852
04:09:00,170 --> 04:09:07,770
But you guys understand that if you go up to the to play in baseball and you strike out seven times in a row

1853
04:09:09,000 --> 04:09:14,040
Well, you hit the ball into play and you get on base three times out of ten

1854
04:09:14,760 --> 04:09:18,280
You are one of the best baseball players to ever live

1855
04:09:20,790 --> 04:09:23,989
If you can hit if you can get to get a 300 batting average

1856
04:09:23,989 --> 04:09:25,989
You're like one of the best players to ever play the game

1857
04:09:26,389 --> 04:09:31,829
So that means i'm allowed seven wicked shitty jokes as long as I tell three good ones

1858
04:09:33,000 --> 04:09:44,659
I'm one of the best joke tellers to ever live. This is not baseball

1859
04:09:51,829 --> 04:09:59,879
You got to draw some walks. No swing and miss only and then hit ball baseball isn't funny

1860
04:10:00,360 --> 04:10:02,360
You got a long way to go, buddy

1861
04:10:03,000 --> 04:10:05,940

I need more customers. We're getting them out very very quickly

2132
04:52:18,439 --> 04:52:19,560
Okay

Where do you see where do you how can you tell is there a way I can see how much shoplifting there's been

2134
04:52:31,290 --> 04:52:34,549
It's been happening for hours

2135
04:52:35,000 --> 04:52:46,740
What are you talking about net profit peak daily unsatisfied theft?

2136
04:52:47,830 --> 04:52:57,619
Holy shit

2137
04:52:57,700 --> 04:52:59,700
There's been 55

2138
04:53:00,340 --> 04:53:05,080
Thefts about the last two

2139
04:53:05,479 --> 04:53:10,020
Okay, the last five days. I've been robbed like fucking 200 times

2140
04:53:10,500 --> 04:53:15,500
People are running in and just grabbing handfuls of bread and running out of the store

2141
04:53:20,459 --> 04:53:29,299
Yeah, I lose I lose like probably five to a hundred to a thousand dollars a day in profit in theft

2142
04:53:32,759 --> 04:53:35,959
So I need security where's those things that when you walk by they go

2143
04:53:38,470 --> 04:53:40,470
Oh fuck, okay security

2144
04:53:42,650 --> 04:53:48,659
We don't have any cameras

2145
04:53:48,659 --> 04:53:57,459
No security in any store. I can't even tell you know, let's follow some people and see if they even go to the checkout

2146
04:53:57,939 --> 04:54:06,119
Let's see. I want to watch somebody pull in

2147
04:54:06,119 --> 04:54:07,619
Hey you

2148
04:54:07,619 --> 04:54:10,180
You're in chat. You just stole something out of the trash

2149
04:54:10,740 --> 04:54:15,459
Like I took something out of the trash. He's going home now

2150
04:54:16,099 --> 04:54:19,110
Is that stealing or is this person just gross?

2151
04:54:23,659 --> 04:54:30,630
Uh, okay. I think that person just went in and grabbed something and left

2152
04:54:32,409 --> 04:54:37,400
Oh my chest

2153
04:54:37,799 --> 04:54:42,439
People really have been just walking in and taking things for the last five hours

2154
04:54:47,290 --> 04:54:51,130
You wonder why I haven't been able to build anything and make any real money

2155
04:54:51,770 --> 04:54:56,150
It's because like 30 of all my margins are destroyed by builders walking out

2156
04:54:56,630 --> 04:55:08,099
Why do I have so many cashiers? I think there was huge demand you missed it

2157
04:55:17,740 --> 04:55:18,700
All right

2158
04:55:18,700 --> 04:55:22,310
Let's let this run out for a second and then I need to make a movie theater

2159
04:55:23,029 --> 04:55:29,720
You haven't fixed the person at the bar working when it's closed

2160
04:55:30,790 --> 04:55:31,669
What?

2161
04:55:31,669 --> 04:55:59,700
What do you mean? Oh shit. All right, that's better gift planning. All right, we're good. They just live here now

2162
04:56:00,709 --> 04:56:02,950
Oh, you come out here with a couple of buddies and have a couple of roos

2163
04:56:03,509 --> 04:56:18,729
They're not stealing this right now. You have to pay up front. What are you doing here? Oh, this is the overnight

2164
04:56:19,419 --> 04:56:23,750
Uh stock person who kind of only needed you for one day

2165
04:56:30,340 --> 04:56:31,779
Oh my god

2166
04:56:31,779 --> 04:56:35,619
Okay guys

2167
04:56:35,619 --> 04:56:43,860
You can just open these doors and just grab a jug of milk and leave I need to

2168
04:56:44,650 --> 04:57:00,180
Oh, you have to only be able to come in from one place. You don't even need to step in the store. You can just

2169
04:57:01,540 --> 04:57:06,759
Reach in and grab something and before even putting your body into this store, you can leave

2170
04:57:12,139 --> 04:57:17,349
Do not know that I didn't know I I kind of didn't I didn't know you could do that

2171
04:57:17,669 --> 04:57:27,540
I thought the security was like people fighting. I don't know. I thought like every time the security in a video game. It's usually

2172
04:57:28,490 --> 04:57:34,090
Just like a security guard stands here. And if there's a fight they break it up in every sim game ever played

2173
04:57:39,270 --> 04:57:43,430
Hey, how's that? Did you steal that? Did you steal that? Did you steal that?

2174
04:57:43,990 --> 04:57:48,150
Did you steal that you stole that you just grabbed it off the table and walked out you stole that

2175
04:57:49,099 --> 04:58:07,220
You stole that I can't believe it. I can't believe this much isn't going by. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. He has something

2176
04:58:07,939 --> 04:58:09,849
He has something too

2177
04:58:09,849 --> 04:58:13,290
Why is it just free food at Jeremy's? This is ridiculous

2178
04:58:14,860 --> 04:58:16,860
He had a bag of groceries

2179
04:58:17,500 --> 04:58:28,259
I don't even think these doors are locked. Can people just come in?

2180
04:58:28,819 --> 04:58:33,720
This is why you need a two-entrance mall and not a promenade

2181
04:58:39,110 --> 04:58:41,349
Oh, I can't I still can't believe

2182
04:58:42,630 --> 04:58:54,869
It's just people walking out with shit like more than 50 plus times a day 20 at least 20 to 30 times a day

2183
04:58:55,189 --> 04:59:06,500
You you know what? Go home. You're wasting money. Hey, hey, that doesn't mean you can take things

2184
04:59:22,169 --> 04:59:27,459
Ah, I got I can't laugh that hard right now. That's very that's very funny that this has been going on the whole time

2185
04:59:28,020 --> 04:59:35,770
Oh, well, is there a way I can see how many times a specific thing has been stolen from that would be so funny

2186
04:59:36,169 --> 04:59:43,990
Like if I could look at that and see how many times somebody took out of it, dude, you're so charitable. Thank you

2187
04:59:46,939 --> 04:59:48,939
Are you treating your employees ethically?

2188
04:59:49,540 --> 04:59:55,139
Well, um, I bet you half of them have been walking out with free groceries every day. So sure I guess

2189
04:59:58,470 --> 05:00:06,330
There's no metal detector here. There's no cameras take only what you need

2190
05:00:06,889 --> 05:00:15,509
That's a guy that doesn't work. You know what happens to the halloween

2191
05:00:16,229 --> 05:00:19,110
Bowl that says honesty one, please

2192
05:00:20,040 --> 05:00:23,619
That whole bowl is gone and i'm not just talking about the candy inside

2193
05:00:23,700 --> 05:00:28,659
I'm talking about the bowl too is gone within five minutes of it being out there

2194
05:00:37,029 --> 05:00:39,750
And then and then that sign that says honesty take one

2195
05:00:40,869 --> 05:00:52,900
Is covered in some kind of shaving cream that policy doesn't work. The sign is gone, too

2196
05:00:52,979 --> 05:00:58,580
Yeah, oh the signs kicked over and there's like five or six distinct foot like shoe prints all over it

2197
05:01:02,470 --> 05:01:04,470
He knows because he was the one that did it

2198
05:01:04,630 --> 05:01:18,020
No, I never did that. I never did that. I didn't even take candy out of that bowl, you know

2199
05:01:18,819 --> 05:01:20,520
You could do

2200
05:01:20,520 --> 05:01:25,479
Some people did this I remember in my neighborhood. There was somebody that was like just dressed up as like a scarecrow

2201
05:01:25,799 --> 05:01:26,659
You know

2202
05:01:26,659 --> 05:01:30,740
They had like a scarecrow outfit and a costume and they were just sitting in a lawn chair in the front lawn

2203
05:01:30,740 --> 05:01:32,340
It's like wait, is that a real person?

2204
05:01:32,340 --> 05:01:35,110
I don't know and then you come up to the door and they go like

2205
05:01:36,470 --> 05:01:40,790
All right kids happy halloween right they're pretending to be a like a monster just sitting there

2206
05:01:40,790 --> 05:01:43,430
Are they a statue or are they are they alive or is it a stuffed person?

2207
05:01:44,310 --> 05:01:48,150
I have the honesty ball there and

2208
05:01:48,389 --> 05:01:50,389
When people come up and you see then they you know

2209
05:01:50,389 --> 05:01:53,270
You're dressed up as like the scarecrow guy or like in a monster costume sitting there

2210
05:01:54,729 --> 05:01:56,729
When they come up and they grab more than one

2211
05:01:57,130 --> 05:02:03,610
You can get up and be like you took more than one candy put it back and they'll be like, oh, so i'm sorry. Mr

2212
05:02:03,610 --> 05:02:04,650
Anderson

2213
05:02:04,650 --> 05:02:06,250
That's right

2214
05:02:06,250 --> 05:02:11,819
That's how we learn

2215
05:02:11,819 --> 05:02:27,180
You little shit no, no, no, no, you can't do that old man arrested

2216
05:02:31,610 --> 05:02:36,299
There's only one box in here

2217
05:02:36,299 --> 05:02:40,459
Go clean that up. No pick up the trash. Don't just spray the trash

2218
05:02:40,860 --> 05:02:45,900
You can't just walk in here and spray trash with febreeze and think that's gonna solve the problem

2219
05:02:45,979 --> 05:02:50,299
You gotta do you have to deal with the solution to the solution to the problem not mask the problem

2220
05:02:50,619 --> 05:03:07,720
Just leave a trail of candy get full-size candy bars and like put them in like a line on the ground in a gigantic

2221
05:03:08,439 --> 05:03:10,759
Like big line that goes around

2222
05:03:11,400 --> 05:03:15,720
You know all the front yard and then it leads up to the guy that's sitting in the chair

2223
05:03:17,979 --> 05:03:21,639
He's a trap

2224
05:03:21,639 --> 05:03:26,200
Ah, I see you've completed the challenge of taking all the candy in the line

2225
05:03:28,740 --> 05:03:30,979
Now put it back exactly how it was

2226
05:03:35,369 --> 05:03:57,259
Did you do chubby bunny? I did it's fucking hilarious. I'm glad there's no debt. All right fast food delicious

2227
05:03:57,900 --> 05:04:01,419
Office workers are doing okay. How what's our demand look like? Hopefully it's movies

2228
05:04:03,159 --> 05:04:07,479
Uh theft has gone up theft is going up. It's in a high

2229
05:04:08,439 --> 05:04:19,849
Upward trend I wouldn't be surprised people were just going into the store room get security. I have to research security

2230
05:04:21,049 --> 05:04:29,060
It's not done yet

2231
05:04:29,060 --> 05:04:33,060
I'm making a movie theater. I'm making a movie theater. You can't steal you can't steal from the movie theater

2232
05:04:35,220 --> 05:04:39,700
That's my biggest problem. I should have done things you cannot steal from you cannot steal from the movie theater

2233
05:04:39,700 --> 05:04:41,700
You have to sit in and actually watch the movie

2234
05:04:42,740 --> 05:04:44,259
Sure. Yeah, you could pirate the movie

2235
05:04:44,259 --> 05:04:46,740
But if you go to the movie theater, you can't like take the screen

2236
05:04:56,580 --> 05:04:57,860
All right. Let's make it

2237
05:04:57,860 --> 05:04:59,860
Taking another loan out. I don't even care

You don't know what your boss sounds like. Okay

2321
05:16:38,650 --> 05:16:43,560
Like there wasn't enough glue on the right side and it's like, uh, I could really point that out

2422
05:29:29,479 --> 05:29:31,099

2423
05:29:31,099 --> 05:29:52,810
Yesterday's sit. Let's look at finance. Excuse me. Why can I not make 30 dollars now?

So I need to actually I think I need another janitor

2427
05:30:24,759 --> 05:30:28,360
The seats are backwards i'm not going to go through the process. They're still watching the movie. It's fine

2428
05:30:28,840 --> 05:30:34,299
Okay, I need I need some staff

2429
05:30:38,009 --> 05:30:40,650
I need at least one or two more janitors. This is ridiculous

2430
05:30:52,409 --> 05:30:58,139
Please no, no, no one's coming to the movies anymore

2431
05:30:58,860 --> 05:31:02,180
All right, get back in here and watch the movies

2432
05:31:10,470 --> 05:31:16,759
Okay, pretty cool so far. I need a trash can. Yep

2433
05:31:17,400 --> 05:31:28,200
Here we go. There it's gonna get cleaned up now

2434
05:31:29,720 --> 05:31:45,779
That's better much better much better much better much better. It's currently movies were really in high demand

2435
05:31:45,779 --> 05:31:58,340
I hit it pretty well movies are still in high demand yesterday's sales. Look at that. Come on and go to the movies already

2436
05:32:04,259 --> 05:32:24,900
What the fuck is this?

2437
05:32:24,900 --> 05:32:25,779
there

2438
05:32:25,779 --> 05:32:42,869
Clean the seat is a trash can the trash can is a seat either or however you want to do it movies close at six

2439
05:32:43,189 --> 05:32:55,779
Oh, that's stupid. How do I um change that?

2440
05:32:57,529 --> 05:33:14,009
Take it lobby opens 9 a.m. Who goes to a movie at 9 a.m. Here we go. That's better movies at midnight

2441
05:33:14,819 --> 05:33:23,349
Matinee 11 10 that's good. And now the workers have to be doing that too. This is nobody here

2442
05:33:31,049 --> 05:33:58,250
What is all this going on? You start here? What is going on down there? That's the sales. All right, let's keep going

2443
05:34:00,310 --> 05:34:05,639
I've not all the parking spaces are there but the whole thing with a drugstore. I don't get it

2444
05:34:05,639 --> 05:34:19,319
All right movie theater is made dude. Look at that. How does it make any sense? I don't understand how this works. Um,

2445
05:34:19,880 --> 05:34:21,619
I've sold like

2446
05:34:21,619 --> 05:34:23,080
150 tickets

2447
05:34:23,159 --> 05:34:41,979
I made 38 dollars. What's up with that? Hopefully that changes increase the price. I don't think you can

2448
05:34:42,380 --> 05:34:49,779
I think it's just automatic. I just realized i've been streaming for five and a half hours

2449
05:34:52,869 --> 05:34:57,849
This is in in new new vegas arc. This is longer than I thought I was gonna be here for

2450
05:34:58,090 --> 05:35:03,979
How come there's nobody where oh right because it doesn't open till later

2451
05:35:05,540 --> 05:35:07,540
All right movies theater is about to open

2452
05:35:07,619 --> 05:35:25,740
Nobody's stealing anything movie theater is open in three two one open come on in movies are open

2453
05:35:28,810 --> 05:36:01,770
Really come on, what's with the big showing I need a big showing how's it still 38 dollars

2454
05:36:06,709 --> 05:36:39,529
60 000 investment and i've made 38 bucks from it. That's nice. It can't even be accurate like the employee hours shows the sales

2455
05:36:39,770 --> 05:36:44,520
Okay, we had a big spike

2456
05:36:44,520 --> 05:36:46,520
18 somewhere around like 15

2457
05:36:47,240 --> 05:36:56,950
I mean that there's nobody wants to see a movie. What the fuck spiked two

2458
05:36:59,049 --> 05:37:16,889
Should be the morning overnight. Okay, we're gonna do shift planning. Okay you oh, I didn't even do this

2459
05:37:17,130 --> 05:37:29,419
Take a look at that. Now there's infinite overlap. We're gonna open at four and we're gonna close at midnight at 21

2460
05:37:31,590 --> 05:37:42,250
Infinite we open at four. We open at six. We close

2461
05:37:45,400 --> 05:38:05,290
23 there you go. Now we got a lot of time here fill it up. Imagine seeing a movie at six in the morning

2462
05:38:05,369 --> 05:38:11,750
Yeah, I would not who watches movies at 6 a.m

2463
05:38:11,990 --> 05:38:27,029
I don't know but they'll it's available if you want to see we got a sale this person by tor

2464
05:38:27,270 --> 05:38:45,590
777 in the chat. You're the one that's awake at 6 a.m. Going to the movies. Oh dude. Hold on. Yo

2465
05:38:46,310 --> 05:38:50,279
What happened? What what happened? Why'd you leave?

2466
05:38:59,799 --> 05:39:13,819
One guy in the whole parking lot. It's an early bird. I should make a diner. Okay, here comes the crowd

2467
05:39:13,819 --> 05:39:15,819
Here comes the lunch crowd

2468
05:39:20,659 --> 05:39:26,020
Um the okay the profit stuff doesn't make any sense this oh this I had this open for

2469
05:39:26,580 --> 05:39:35,400
Almost six hours. We've made way more than three or four thousand dollars here. Oh security too. What can I guard?

2470
05:39:35,959 --> 05:39:51,560
What can I do? Let me look at that demand fresh meat. I got it arcade games. I don't have that

2471
05:39:51,880 --> 05:40:02,619
What's the research? What was security to self-balancing scooters security guards?

2472
05:40:03,180 --> 05:40:29,590
How do I hire a security guard?

2473
05:40:29,669 --> 05:40:35,159
I can't make a security guard. I need a security area like a building for them

2474
05:40:38,470 --> 05:40:40,150
security center

2475
05:40:40,150 --> 05:41:05,220
Just a little one. It's the tiny one just big enough for them to be somewhere like over like here security center

2476
05:41:06,580 --> 05:41:07,540
Okay

2477
05:41:07,540 --> 05:41:16,659
I need to make door here staff door. This is for security people only. All right. So now what do I do?

2478
05:41:17,529 --> 05:41:20,470
manage the security store

2479
05:41:22,680 --> 05:41:30,680
hire guard security

2480
05:41:31,209 --> 05:41:35,130
You okay pick a patrol for your guard. All right edit patrols

2481
05:41:37,290 --> 05:41:40,950
I want you right here here here

2482
05:41:41,689 --> 05:41:43,500
here

2483
05:41:43,500 --> 05:41:54,680
Uh here here here here here here here here here here and here and here

2484
05:41:58,459 --> 05:42:11,459
Okay, there's like a couch. He's one person

2485
05:42:11,939 --> 05:42:18,599
Yeah, I know he'll get the job done. I'm like the stream's over in like 10 minutes. Anyways, I don't care

2486
05:42:21,909 --> 05:42:44,069
Where are they something's wrong? Wait, what it's definitely this is where all the money is made in here

2487
05:42:47,990 --> 05:42:58,150
Just right here. Is that better patrol edit patrol? What's going on with this left click to extend patrol?

2488
05:42:58,950 --> 05:42:59,830
Oh

2489
05:42:59,830 --> 05:43:18,580
You have to actually draw this shit. Okay, that's good. Let's do it. What does he work?

2490
05:43:18,979 --> 05:43:40,700
Why is it why is it such a low battery? Is he working? I just want to see him

2491
05:43:41,619 --> 05:43:48,139
Make sure they're doing their job. Yeah, I just wanted to walk around here. No more theft

2492
05:43:48,540 --> 05:43:55,819
I'm not gonna get robbed anymore. This game is pretty fun. I kind of really like this. It's really fun

2493
05:43:56,869 --> 05:44:01,400
Now imagine if you had all this

2494
05:44:01,400 --> 05:44:06,650
Here's the thing though. If you're gonna do sandbox mode give yourself like 50 million dollars

2495
05:44:08,310 --> 05:44:11,830
Because it's very expensive and we didn't even get to crash the surface over here

2496
05:44:11,990 --> 05:44:29,720
I want to see him and then i'm gonna call it here. I'll call it here. I want I gotta get up

2497
05:44:36,340 --> 05:44:38,180
mall fortress

2498
05:44:38,180 --> 05:44:43,720
This is definitely made more than 200 bucks that's lagging data. That's like two months behind

2499
05:44:55,060 --> 05:45:15,639
There is uh, don't you have a route? Excuse me. Go out go out the door, dude

2500
05:45:17,860 --> 05:45:26,439
Go out the door and do your work. You can't cross the parking lot

2501
05:45:27,939 --> 05:45:34,979
Why not? Yes, he can fire me from this hellhole. You need to click the route

2502
05:45:37,319 --> 05:46:27,450
Oh, okay. Go for it. Do it man. Okay. Go I just gave him like the dog zoomies

2503
05:46:27,450 --> 05:46:32,819
That's all I did. Is he catching anybody? Oh, he's on a scooter

2504
05:46:40,889 --> 05:46:56,250
Arrest somebody pokemon ai

2505
05:46:58,470 --> 05:47:00,709
No, not pokemon ai this guy's doing this

2506
05:47:02,580 --> 05:47:08,500
He's just circling in the grass over and over again because he wants to he's shiny hunting all of a sudden

2507
05:47:08,500 --> 05:47:10,500
It's just gonna go

2508
05:47:15,139 --> 05:47:29,529
He'll be here for like the next six weeks the loan the loan the loan

2509
05:47:30,490 --> 05:47:33,689
I have so much time to pay that loan. I'm fine. I have a hundred days to pay it

2510
05:47:39,939 --> 05:47:41,619
I think this is pretty cool

2511
05:47:41,619 --> 05:47:48,470
Okay, we got a restaurant. We've got a security spot. We've got a bar

2512
05:47:49,110 --> 05:47:52,779
There's a movie theater

2513
05:47:52,779 --> 05:47:56,299
There's like a shoe store. There's a grocery store fresh bread

2514
05:47:57,830 --> 05:48:01,669
booze beer

2515
05:48:01,669 --> 05:48:06,729
Hey, what is this place for people to fuck just slack off?

2516
05:48:08,459 --> 05:48:10,459
A bar in a theater that no one go to

2517
05:48:10,619 --> 05:48:17,930
Well, just wait until it's be like another expansion this way with like another big thing

2518
05:48:18,490 --> 05:48:23,770
I'm making money. It's not making a lot of money, but i'm making money

2519
05:48:27,380 --> 05:48:29,619
All right. I'm out of here. I'll see you guys tomorrow

2520
05:48:30,729 --> 05:48:32,889
Tomorrow we're going to

2521
05:48:32,889 --> 05:48:39,860
That's a mystery. I don't know

2522
05:48:39,860 --> 05:48:42,099
There are a few I didn't think I was gonna play this for six hours

2523
05:48:48,040 --> 05:48:51,430
Yeah, it'll be a mystery stream tomorrow. I'll find something

2524
05:48:54,419 --> 05:48:56,419
This week is mystery streams. That's for sure

2525
05:48:56,819 --> 05:48:58,819
Next week is horror stuff. We're gonna do vr stuff, too

2526
05:48:59,299 --> 05:49:07,130
This is a lot of fun though. I feel the same way about this that I felt about something like city skylines

2527
05:49:08,259 --> 05:49:10,740
Do you actually understand design and architecture?

2528
05:49:11,299 --> 05:49:13,209
I mean, it's just fun to do

2529
05:49:13,290 --> 05:49:18,979
Want to make your own like little storefronts I give this a stamp

2530

2534
05:49:41,700 --> 05:49:45,020

Okay

2542
05:50:46,099 --> 05:50:48,659
If jimmy kimmel raided the stream that means it'd probably be like

2543
05:50:49,299 --> 05:50:57,939
200,000 concurrent viewers and I would have to keep the stream going. No, you know what I probably just leave

2544
05:50:59,209 --> 05:51:06,919
That's I am that streams over two hundred thousand people raid. I'd be like guys. I'm leaving

05:52:33,270 --> 05:52:36,150
Thanks finished at five fifty nine fifty nine

2559
05:52:37,450 --> 05:52:41,959
Uh, I don't you know, it's really hard to do that because when I hit end stream

2560
05:52:42,439 --> 05:52:45,159
I think it actually takes a few seconds for it to actually turn the stream off

2561
05:52:47,610 --> 05:52:50,810
Oh, by the way, uh, also something uh that I forgot and I didn't really know

2562
05:52:51,290 --> 05:52:52,659
um

2563
05:52:52,659 --> 05:52:54,580
This is dead serious

2564
05:52:54,580 --> 05:52:56,580
I mean this with all of my heart

2565
05:52:56,819 --> 05:52:59,939
This is not me making something up

2566
05:52:59,939 --> 05:53:01,619
the ow thing

2567
05:53:01,619 --> 05:53:05,909
When the janitor walks over and bumps into the thing and you guys say ow I thought

2568
05:53:06,470 --> 05:53:08,470
For the last two straight years

2569
05:53:08,470 --> 05:53:13,270
That you were talking about like oh he bumped into me. He bumped into my face

2570
05:53:14,060 --> 05:53:22,409
I didn't know there was a loud sound on it. I did not know that until three days ago

2571
05:53:31,209 --> 05:53:34,009
I thought it was because here he comes. He oh he bumped you

2572
05:53:34,729 --> 05:53:49,189
I did not know there was even a sound effect on it. That's not why

2573
05:53:49,750 --> 05:53:54,310
I was doing it because of the bump not the sound but wait, is is there a sound?

2574
05:53:54,470 --> 05:53:58,700
How come I don't hear the sound when he does it? I'm curious

2575
05:54:02,580 --> 05:54:09,770
How come there was no sound there? There's no sound there

2576
05:54:13,689 --> 05:54:20,970
It was how come I didn't hear it there is sound it's like a wet slap

2577
05:54:27,130 --> 05:54:30,009
