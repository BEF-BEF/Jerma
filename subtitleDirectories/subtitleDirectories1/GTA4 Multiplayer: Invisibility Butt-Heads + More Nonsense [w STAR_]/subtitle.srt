00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,339
It's a beautiful day today. Did you see the sun?

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,029
I can't see the sun because of my cameras facing the stairs.

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:15,029
Oh, well, you know, just sitting on this staircase with you makes me just remember the days when I was younger.

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,030
There was all kinds of fun things we used to do. I used to come to the-

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:33,359
Oh, my head, Jerma. Is this what you used to do in the old days?

6
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,219
Well, I didn't think we would ever be in outer space together, just floating around.

7
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,399
I don't know what to say. This is too dumb. Whoa, where are we going?

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,960
I kind of want to just- I want to see what happens when I try to get out.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,510
This is so awkward looking. Good thing I'm like riding you.

10
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,510
This is just a piggyback.

11
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:36,939
No, get out of my way. It's my friend. No, I want to get in. No, I'm in. I can't. I have to drive it.

12
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,969
These guys are too dangerous, yet again.

13
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:51,450
No, we don't want you to drive the car. You die.

14
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,739
It's going too fast.

15
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,739
You're going to make me sick.

16
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:08,620
We're going to the water.

17
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,620
This is so stupid. I'm going to hit my head on the-

18
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:29,150
This is real. That person's head would have just censored great.

19
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:38,500
Okay, here we go. Here we go. We're doing a revert ramp.

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Oh, yeah. Tony Hawk's pro skater.

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Except with bikes, so completely different.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Damn, that was sick.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,169
200 points. 300 points. You are a rock star.

24
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,860
150 points.

25
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,550
How many points, Jeremiah?

26
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,139
Didn't kill me.

27
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,509
Look at the two ostriches in their natural habitat.

28
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,509
I want someone to walk by and see us like this.

29
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:22,379
And just be like, what the fuck is going on here?

30
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,379
Get in the car.

31
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,379
What about these dolls that are just standing upright?

32
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:47,509
This larch-looking son of a bitch is still standing.

33
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,750
Look at this person.

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,139
She has just moved.

35
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,139
Look at the way she's holding the gun. Look at her shoulders.

36
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,139
She's hunched over. She just doesn't care.

37
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,139
I thought she instantly died.

38
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,089
She had enough.

39
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,100
She had enough.

40
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm not sure what's happening.

41
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,370
Oh, this is so stupid.

42
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,370
Can we move on from this?

43
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,370
What? Why?

44
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,370
Why did that happen?

45
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,370
Why is it not letting us go over this?

46
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,019
What is it?

47
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:56,620
Are you dead?

48
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,470
I don't know.

49
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,470
Apparently, if you stub your toe, you just die.

50
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,470
You know what? I think I was dead in midair,

51
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,470
and it just didn't say I was dead until I left.

52
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:31,750
I don't have any words for this.

53
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,439
Did you see how we were jello-jiggling down that staircase?

54
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,439
No, I just instantly died and was gone.

55
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,439
That was jello.

56
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,439
We were just jello sliding around in somebody's cup.

57
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,699
Do you eat jello out of a cup?

58
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,699
Yeah, you can.

59
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,699
I mean, you can, but would you?

60
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,939
Don't hit me over here.

61
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,939
You'll never get me.

62
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,889
What?

63
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,319
I got you.

64
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
How did this even happen?

65
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,310
No, the tire.

66
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,639
Something tells me that's not going to work.

67
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,800
That's not going to work.

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You're going to crash your game.

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:37,189
You just wait until one of them spawns up there.

70
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,910
The balance.

71
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,470
I could not replicate that if I tried.

72
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,470
I just love how you keep ditching different cars

73
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,899
and trying other things.

74
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,899
Okay, I got it this time.

75
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,899
For some reason, I don't have hydraulics,

76
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,899
but I'm putting the hydraulics on.

77
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:58,899
God damn it, that doesn't work.

78
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,899
Ditch it.

79
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,040
Try the helicopter.

80
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
No, let's try 14 garbage trucks.

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Come on, do the thing.

82
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,420
I know you're going to do it.

83
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,420
No, get away from me.

84
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,920
No, get away from me.

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,120
No, no, no.

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Get me up.

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,990
Get me up.

88
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:41,079
You made a staircase of garbage trucks.

89
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,079
You ought to do some platforming.
