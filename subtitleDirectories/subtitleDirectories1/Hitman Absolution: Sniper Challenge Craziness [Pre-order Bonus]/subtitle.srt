1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,279
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,640
Well, not really Hitman Absolution. Hitman Absolution does not come out for another couple weeks,

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:24,660
but this is the pre-order mission you get if you pre-order the game. So I guess this is a sniper challenge.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,899
I have to kill this guy right here and...

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,829
Should I just shoot him right now?

6
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:37,789
Oh my god!

7
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,789
Dude, did I just beat the mission immediately?

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,920
Oh my god!

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,159
I'm just going absolutely crazy. I haven't even introduced the video.

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,159
I haven't even introduced the video and I killed the guy.

11
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,850
Dude, why did I do that?

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,310
Oh my word, should I not have done that?

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,310
Let's see if I can even complete this.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,799
Dude, I blew that guy's brains out.

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,069
Oh, get smashed.

16
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,329
All these people freaking out.

17
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:11,700
Look, it's like somebody dropped a grenade at the party. Everyone's like running around.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait. God evacuated. I gotta find any of the gods.

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,069
Alright, well anyways, I'm really excited for Hitman Absolution.

20
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,069
If you can tell.

21
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,310
And...

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,439
Damn it.

23
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,439
Let's just not shoot into the crowd.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Oh, wait.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
There he is right there.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,459
Oh, come on.

27
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,890
You bastard.

28
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,450
Oh, he's not getting in that helicopter.

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,450
I will make sure he does not get in that helicopter.

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,450
I will put a bullet in between his eyes.

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,689
Just like this guy right here.

32
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,689
Slow time down and...

33
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,569
No, I missed.

34
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,879
Oh, that's a times two baby.

35
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,500
Wait, wait, wait. Where is he?

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,510
There he is, there he is. Look at this guy.

37
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,510
Please don't kill me.

38
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,509
Please don't kill me.

39
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,680
No, he's gonna get away.

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,310
He's gonna get away.

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,889
No, I gotta do the last ditch effort.

42
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,889
No, no, we evacuated.

43
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,889
Alright, let's try this again.

44
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,099
Right in his face.

45
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,409
Right in his face.

46
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,409
This next guy is gonna be second in line to die.

47
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,250
Get him right in his shoulder blade.

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,810
Oh, somebody saw that.

49
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,689
I gotta be careful here.

50
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,759
Let me reload this damn thing.

51
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,780
Let's go 47. Get your game on.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
This guy down here. I don't wanna hit the window.

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,139
What? What?

54
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,879
Hey, what happened to the window behind me?

55
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,120
It just like exploded.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,530
Hey, did I insta-die?

57
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,599
I think I should be in the clear though.

58
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
Now I'm gonna take my time here.

59
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
Because every time I kill somebody, like this guy over here,

60
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,400
everybody freaks out.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,030
Is there somebody like on the roof? Oh, there is.

62
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,080
Is this a bodyguard?

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,389
What was that guy doing?

64
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,389
That guy was putting his hands on his waist like

65
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,949
I am a superhero.

66
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,379
You got killed, man.

67
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:40,789
Is there like a, what?

68
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,789
Is that a bodyguard up there?

69
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,789
Are you serious?

70
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:52,370
What? How am I supposed to hit this guy?

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh, this guy.

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,569
That's a long fall.

73
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,960
That's a long fall. He's still going.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,520
Imagine looking over and seeing that.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay.

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,090
Wow, that took like 15 seconds

77
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,089
for that bullet to hit that guy.

78
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,100
I only got 12 minutes here.

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,170
I gotta be sly.

80
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,370
Anybody else out here? Is anybody gonna see me shoot this guy?

81
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm going for this guy right now.

82
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,920
Right in his chest.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Load, reload.

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,279
Exposed? What do you mean exposed?

85
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,949
I gotta kill this guy right here.

86
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,949
I'm gonna be such a bad shot though.

87
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,620
Oh, bang.

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,060
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,430
How did I get exposed?

90
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,430
Who is it?

91
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,430
Who's placing a phone call?

92
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,050
Oh, this guy right here is like looking for me.

93
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,050
Get shot in the face, dude.

94
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,019
What, what, what, what, what, what, what is he,

95
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,410
where's he making the phone call?

96
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,410
Hey, you're not gonna find me. Where is that guy shooting?

97
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,410
Hey, bro, I'm over here to your right.

98
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,699
I'm not like over there, like over this way.

99
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,699
Oh, there he is. Oh, he's about to make the phone call

100
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,939
aka run. Oh, he's gonna get

101
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,939
smashed.

102
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,180
Right in his side.

103
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,699
You're dead, man.

104
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,420
Oh, hold on, I gotta get this guy. Boink.

105
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
Man, getting headshots. You gotta have some skill shots

106
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,720
to hit fellas. Oh, there goes the whole

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
party. At least I killed the target.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,019
Right in his back. Moving kill streak.

109
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:53,279
Nice. Oh, let me get them all.

110
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,279
See ya. Right in your glasses.

111
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,589
Oh, brutal.

112
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,680
Oh, guard evacuated. What? Where's there another guard?

113
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,740
Down here? I only have three more left.

114
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,129
I don't know where any of them are.

115
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,079
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Right in his forehead.

116
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,129
Go ahead. See ya. See ya.

117
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,209
Any more? Any more?

118
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,209
Oh, cowboy John apparently is

119
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,209
like still like hanging out doing karate moves.

120
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,410
Oh, boy.

121
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,939
No, those are bartenders.

122
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,009
There's only one guard left. Where the hell is he?

123
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,009
Oh, I can hold.

124
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,009
I can use like instinct. I have like

125
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,209
super powers. Ooh.

126
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,209
Oh, damn. This guy's, oh, this guy's

127
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,639
gonna hit right in his face.

128
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,399
Right here. Ready? Here it is.

129
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,029
Oh, baby. Yeah.

130
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,800
Hey, I did it.

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,259
Nice.

132
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,259
Well, I wonder what kind of score I got. I didn't do that well.

133
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,040
Silent Assassin? No, I didn't.

134
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,660
I got, oh, I unlocked something

135
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
for Hitman Absolution. Increased the

136
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,959
stability on sniper rifles. Oh, that's

137
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,839
gonna be a good thing to have.

138
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,839
But yeah, thanks so much for watching guys.

139
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,839
Really do appreciate it. I am so excited

140
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,839
for Hitman Absolution, which

141
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,839
launches in less than two weeks. It's gonna be

142
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,839
so much fun. You're gonna see a lot of content of that game

143
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,839
on this channel. So stay tuned for

144
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,839
that, guys. And again, if you pre-order

145
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,839
Hitman. I know this is somewhat old

146
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,839
content. It came out a while back.

147
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,839
But if you pre-order Hitman right now, you're gonna be able to get

148
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,839
this and have some fun with it.

149
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,839
So I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,

150
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,839
take care, everybody.
