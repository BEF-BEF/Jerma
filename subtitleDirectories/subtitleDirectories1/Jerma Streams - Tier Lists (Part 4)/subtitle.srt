1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:15,859
Alright, let me get, I need to have my Chrome. Google Chrome. Look at that. Um, give me one second.

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,500
Turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,929
I have to change to just chatting too. Where the heck? And I gotta have music too. I can't just

4
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:46,619
sit here silent. We need like a music. I'll turn the camera on, but it's not right. I need music.

5
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:57,829
Face cam, please. I'm going to put it on. I'm very sweaty though. Okay. Let's do this condiments and

6
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:12,140
sauces. Okay. And then world of Warcraft expansions. This one's going to be really fun. I can't wait to

7
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:20,469
do this one. What's this? This is YouTube link. Why did I just click? I'm not, why did I just click

8
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:31,879
that? That's why would I click the first link in chat? Am I insane? I'm not playing Joel's

9
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,879
3d movie maker movie for background noise. I want to watch it on the video stream.

10
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:55,180
It's not, that's not music. What's this? This is the same one. I'm just going to put on my own.

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,180
Okay. We, how about, uh, no, I'm not watching it. No, we're going to watch it during the

12
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:12,569
watch movies stream. Cause that's a, that's a movie. It'll be in between two public domain

13
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:35,669
movies. All right. What do I want to listen to? How about let's go back to here. Oh no. It's,

14
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:57,419
oh shit. My shit's broken. Can I do this? Let's get that window, window capture.

15
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,379
Oh no, Jeremy, your stream. It's all right. It'll be fine. Don't worry. Everybody relax.

16
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:34,539
Condiments and tier lists. Let's shrink this, shrink that so we can see it better.

17
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:57,699
I'll put my camera up here. I look wicked ugly. No, I don't look pretty handsome. Okay.

18
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,349
Let's take a look. How do I look right now? I think I've ever had like some stains on my shirt,

19
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:13,000
but what am I going to do? Can you see me? Why is the camera so big? Oh right. I was doing that.

20
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:30,360
Thank you. Look at how big. Oh, hi guys. I know I'm not a single and there we go. Wait, let me

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:51,290
apply. No, who cares? All right. So let's go. Jeremy lied about wicked ugly. Uh, I'm going to say,

22
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,639
first of all, let's add actually, no, this is just D is just D already off the bat. I, well,

23
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm not even in just chatting. How do I change that? Hold on. Can I first close this? What the

24
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:27,750
fuck am I doing? Just chatting. Just how about just tears? I mean, that's what we're doing.

25
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:42,149
That looks good. Tears. We're in the right category. I got to get a haircut too. Thanks

26
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:53,160
for reminding me. All right. So we've got sriracha. I hate it. Honey. Let's put a honey and B for now.

27
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:02,519
I didn't even put on any music either. It'll come later. Mayonnaise. But the thing is about

28
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,480
mayonnaise. I don't, I don't eat. I don't put it on everything. I only put it on some stuff.

29
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:22,420
This just hurts. I did it when something hurts to eat it. I don't want it. This is mayonnaise,

30
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,980
right? Okay. Ranch. I think ranch is overrated, but I still like it.

31
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:41,990
I've not made my decision. Honey is in B. I hold on. I'm just getting, I'm just getting it up here.

32
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm not ready yet. Hummus is somewhere between A and S. It's I lived off that stuff in college.

33
00:06:51,689 --> 00:07:03,939
Tomato, like pizza sauce. Why is there like tomato sauce? It's like spaghetti. This is pesto.

34
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:14,680
It's okay. This is Dijon mustard. I'm just getting it up there. This is barbecue sauce.

35
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:24,730
Hold on. Just to keep it, keep it in B. Tartar sauce. B. Frank's Red Hot is the worst condiment

36
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:34,170
in the world. It is absolutely fucking revolting. It does not know what it wants to be.

37
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,529
It so desperately wants to be a hot sauce, but it just tastes like buttery, gross liquid. It's

38
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:53,050
like that hot flavor, right? No, it's awful. It's hot sauce that's not hot. It's just like

39
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,899
the buffalo flavor. That's the worst one in the whole list. So I would eat Sriracha five

40
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:13,160
times before I had Frank's once. Regular default, yellow mustard. I like Dijon better.

41
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,680
Thousand Island is all right. Ketchup is good, but I'm going to have a lot of B's.

42
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,759
Jack Daniel's. Just Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce or like just drinking Jack Daniel's?

43
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,889
Honey mustard, that goes up here. This is guacamole. Guacamole, it really depends on what

44
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:41,929
kind of guacamole and who made it because guacamole can be down here or guacamole can be up here.

45
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:52,139
So I'm going to take the average and I'm going to say somewhere around here, like here. Okay, now

46
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:03,350
salsa is S. I eat salsa all the fucking time. I love salsa. It's, yeah. Salsa is one of the

47
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,350
only things you could just eat every day and probably not care and not get sick of it.

48
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:21,830
That and this is a Cholula. Cholula is good. Cholula is better than Sriracha. In my opinion,

49
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:31,720
rather have to say that is better than guacamole. This is not even done. This is not even correct.

50
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:42,330
This is not accurate. Maple syrup. What is this? Relish. And then this is Worcestershire sauce.

51
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,259
I don't put it on anything. All right. Let me, okay. I need music.

52
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:58,539
Give me music. Turn that camera off first. You marinate. Yeah, but it's on a, is that condiment?

53
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:11,370
Oh, it's soy sauce. Right. Okay. If it's soy sauce, I don't like it. I actually really don't like soy

54
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,210
sauce at all. I'm sorry. I know people are getting mad about that. It's not that far down though.

55
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:22,090
It's, I would rather have soy sauce than like Jack Daniel's fucking garbage can barbecue sauce.

56
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:44,889
All right. I need music. Just chill music. Chill out music. I did click on the first one, which

57
00:10:44,889 --> 00:11:00,549
means, is this point your camera out the window airplane vlog? I don't know. Is it? This is like

58
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:16,980
a regular song. Chill step. There's something called chill step. What is that genre? I like

59
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:31,259
this. This is fine. This can stay. Come back. So let me, let me narrow this down. Honey should be

60
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:38,789
up here. Pesto is good for three bites. And then you start, it's just be, you hate it. Seriously,

61
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,070
like the first two or three bites of something with pesto on it, you go, holy shit, that's

62
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,590
fucking incredible. And then after that, you do like, I don't want to eat this anymore.

63
00:11:45,590 --> 00:12:03,750
I would definitely rather have tomato sauce on something than ranch. I would never eat this.

64
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:18,279
No, they would never, I would never eat that ever. Pesto is a condiment for an obese college student.

65
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:29,610
What? Hold on. I got to fix my like Lego hair. It's a little better. Tartar sauce is not better

66
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:46,779
than barbecue sauce. It's good. It's close. It's really close. I'm trying to figure out this is

67
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:54,899
S or A. They both S. Would I rather like, no, sausage is S. Sausage complete S.

68
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:04,820
Honey is better than Thomas. I have a rule that I cannot have more than two or three S's. So it,

69
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:23,639
otherwise, like what the hell do you think you're doing? Oh, I would put, I would use it. I would

70
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:35,559
use both of them. Ketchup is better than mustard. I'm talking regular, just yellow mustard. I think

71
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:52,789
I'm good. I think this is it. No, it's not true. I'm done. Why is soy so low? I just, I don't know.

72
00:13:52,789 --> 00:14:04,519
I don't like it. It just tastes, it just tastes like salty, dirty water to me. I know. Everybody

73
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,230
hates me now. I know. But I, but look, it's not, I, this is, I would still eat it. I would still

74
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,990
like it. I wouldn't mind it if it was like part of something, if it was on something already,

75
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,789
but adding soy sauce is just like salt water. It's just like, it's like taking a, you're dipping

76
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:29,590
a cup in the ocean and like sipping the cup. It's just like salt bomb. If it's on something and I,

77
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:35,799
dipping like sushi in it, that's pretty good. But honey is gross. Well, we have different opinions

78
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:45,929
and I'm so happy about that. Hey, I like soy sauce more than I like relish. In fact, that's not fair

79
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:55,700
because I would rather have this than, now it's ready. I'd rather have Cholula than soy sauce.

80
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,179
I'd rather have tomato sauce than soy sauce. I'd rather have guacamole than soy sauce. I'd rather

81
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:07,269
have, this is not true. That's completely untrue. I actually would not, I would rather have soy

82
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:25,720
sauce than pesto. No, I wouldn't. Guacamole, no. Okay. I'm done. Uh, Joel just, Joel just rated me.

83
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:35,399
What's up, Joel? Your movie was fucking sick. I saw your movie. It was fucking sick.

84
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:47,559
My favorite part is when, I mean, he did, liar, liar. What? Don't, don't mess around like that.

85
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:56,299
Joel, what do you think of my list and those viewers that came from, Joel, what do you think

86
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:06,970
of this list? People, Joel, mayonnaise, right? It's an English thing. Joel's not from England.

87
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:24,120
Don't even, why I said that? Um, not even close. Same, same like continent. Okay. Um, I'm, it's

88
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:36,120
an English, that's a, that's a European thing. That's what I was told. I was, I told the fries in,

89
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:46,389
in, I almost said oregano. Fries and mayonnaise is an, is a European thing. Joel, please quantify

90
00:16:46,389 --> 00:17:00,169
this. Mayo on fries is definitely a European thing. Joel, do you do this? Joel, I'm not going

91
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:26,170
to move on until you answer me. You're not even here. I got long ass fingernails. Uh, he's not

92
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,900
even here. He's not here. Oh, well, thanks for the, no, really, thanks for the host or the raid,

93
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,900
whatever it was. I hope you guys had a fun time. He did respond. Thank you, Dad, for the 10 community

94
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,859
subs. We got him, oh yeah, World of Warcraft expansions. Right, that's the other one.

95
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:49,589
Here we go. Ready? I'll do this with my eyes closed. I think I'm probably gonna get it right.

96
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,470
Let me just see where they are. Like, no, I didn't even have to look at it. I, okay.

97
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:59,640
World of Warcraft expansion tier list and just game tier list. I'm not even paying attention.

98
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:10,650
I don't even know what I'm looking at. Where, okay, where, where, where is, where are we?

99
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:35,210
Where's Burning Crusade? Where's Burning Crusade? Fast as lightning. The panda is in A? No, no, no,

100
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:42,740
no, it's not. Uh, this is where the game started to be bad. This is, I remember, I remember,

101
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,339
I remember loading up World of Warcraft during that expansion and playing for like six hours and

102
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:53,220
going, this is, this game's not fun anymore. That's where I started to stop playing. Then,

103
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,019
you're probably wondering, Jeremo, what the fuck is Legion doing? I think Legion was the best,

104
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,380
like, the best expansion that came out recently in the last, like, 10 years. How long, well,

105
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,480
this is two expansions ago, right? Legion brought me back to the game and I thought it was really,

106
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,680
really, really great. Not as good as that when you first played on classic. Wrath of the Lich King,

107
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,480
best expansion pack. I think that's not an unpopular opinion and Burning Crusade, very

108
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:28,180
classic. These were, these were, these were so awful, I'm gonna give them a mention. I'm

109
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,660
not even sure this is even the right one, but I know it's not one of these, so it's, it belongs

110
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:48,490
down here. All right, any more? Official TF2 maps. You want to do TF2 maps? Chex mix. I don't think

111
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:57,349
I can do the TF2 maps. It's been a long time. Why can I not? Computers are so bad. I can't even

112
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:03,720
right-click in the chat that's in Streamlabs OBS. Have I said anything good about Streamlabs OBS?

113
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:13,339
Why do I still use it? Is there a reason why I'm still using this? This is free. No, so I'm not

114
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:20,180
talking about it, right? Yeah, I guess. Uh, there's so many maps in TF2. This is gonna, I don't know

115
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:28,890
if I can, I might have to do, this is gonna be sloppy. Not using XSplit. I tried to use XSplit,

116
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:36,890
it's way worse. And you have to pay for XSplit. Remember, JetBlue is the only company I like.

117
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:54,039
All right, where was it? TF2 maps. Let me see it again. Foldmetal Alchemist characters. All right,

118
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:39,500
let's do Chex Mix. God damn it, give me a break. Uh, Chex Mix. Okay. Chex are gross. I dare,

119
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:51,079
they're not good. They're very, they're very bad. Now I'm done. This has to be like a generational

120
00:21:51,079 --> 00:22:00,069
change thing. You ate around the Chex when I was younger. You didn't eat the Chex. It's like, just

121
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:08,140
do Foldmetal Alchemist. Why do you want me to do Foldmetal Alchemist? Call of Duty games? I've

122
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,980
played three of them. I can't do this one. Official TF2 maps. Well, why not? Let's do this one. This

123
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:28,470
sounds like interesting for a little bit. Oh my God. I'm kind of getting into the, into the weeds

124
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:40,890
here. Uh, are these five CP or? Okay. I don't, no opinion. I don't have any opinion. Manpower?

125
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,650
No, no, no, no. Thunder Mountain Manpower. What do you, what does this, what does that mean?

126
00:22:51,589 --> 00:23:03,000
Tuber Town? Thunder Mountain Manpower. It's just Thunder Mountain. Okay.

127
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:14,700
I don't remember. Hydro? F. Doomsday? F. Snowplow? I actually kind of remember this being, okay.

128
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:30,220
Upward. Did I have more fun on Gorge or upward? That's accurate. Now I love Gorge. Attack Defend

129
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,980
Gorge is like the best map they've ever made. I love for Gorge. It's so much. Um, where's Dust

130
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,380
Bull? Yeah. Call me a loser. Call me like an idiot. That's fine. That's one of my favorite

131
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,660
maps. Original, original team for you. It doesn't even play TF Classic. You understand.

132
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:55,029
This is Team Fortress 2. I know. Badwater is up there, but it's okay. It's okay. Nightfall.

133
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,609
I don't, Banana Bay. Don't know. Two Ford Invasion. I played it like once or twice.

134
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:11,299
Barn Blitz. Get up there. It leads to B. It's an A. No, it's not. Probed. Frontier. Get up there.

135
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:18,809
Frontier is not better than Badwater. Yes, it is. It's better than Badwater. Better than Barn Blitz.

136
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:28,230
Um, Viaduct. This is not fair though because this is different game modes. Like I think Viaduct is

137
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,359
awesome, but I don't know if I would put Viaduct in the same category as like upward. You know what

138
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:40,119
I mean? They're like they're completely different game modes. That's just tricky. This is not

139
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:51,690
accurate. I'll keep doing it though. Um, I know a lot of people that play comp are going to hate my

140
00:24:51,690 --> 00:25:02,809
guts, but I really don't like any of the comp maps. I really don't like them that much. I just don't.

141
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:21,140
Two Ford sucks, but it's fun just to snipe. Granary is not that low. I know, but Lakeside.

142
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,420
I love Lakeside, but not how much though. Not that much. I've never been to Brazil.

143
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,309
Snowy Coast. It's taken me a while to remember these though. Snakewater? No.

144
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,910
No. Wait, Snakewater was... No, that's Badlands.

145
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:47,180
Powerhouse? Well, no. I don't really... Where's the one that I really don't like?

146
00:25:47,980 --> 00:26:01,019
It's Harvest. Yes, can you tell? I just played Harvest for like six hours straight. Like three

147
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:10,630
days a week. I just like... What do you... Oh, there's... There it is. Where... What does it do?

148
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:18,869
Tack Defend Gorge. There it is. Sawmill. Sawmill. Sawmill. Sawmill is good, but I don't know if I

149
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:31,619
would put sawmill up where Nucleus is. I really don't think so. Egypt. Awful. King of the Hill

150
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:41,880
Badlands. Do I remember playing this? Where is the... Where is the... Where is it? Not Junction.

151
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,440
It was one of the fairly newer ones when I... Right before I stopped playing.

152
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:55,259
Is this Payload Thunder Mountain? Yeah. Get this out of here. Manpower. What was it called?

153
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:03,910
Was it Borneo? I think it was Borneo. I really liked this one, if I'm remembering correctly.

154
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,380
This is the one where it... Where it turns the corner and there's always a sentry in the little

155
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:21,380
house? Yeah, this one's great. I was... I was that guy. I was the one doing the sentry in the little

156
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:35,299
house. It worked every time. What a great game. This game's so good. Why can... Why can nothing

157
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:47,769
ever replace this? No, I didn't really like the Sawmill map. I don't know what Watergate is.

158
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:52,170
I think these are Manver's Machine Maps. I can't... Don't know opinion on it, really.

159
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:04,390
Kong King was not very good. I really don't like Kong King. People are going to hate me for this

160
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:15,180
one. I actually really like Turbine. It's a mess. Well, I don't really like it. I like it enough.

161
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:28,759
Mercenary Park. Lazarus Pipeline. I remember Pipeline. What is the one that never ends?

162
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:39,859
What is Hightower? There it is. Okay. Hightower also comes up a little bit higher than Turbine,

163
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:52,490
for sure. New maps are good. Timbertown. Oh, I really hated Steel. I remember every time

164
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,170
it would change to Steel, I would instantly hit cancel. I'd spam, spam, spam, because the game,

165
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,049
when it was loading, you couldn't do anything. And I remember just trying desperately to make

166
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,009
sure I hit cancel so I could go back to the other, to the service screen. Every time.

167
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:22,900
Process was okay. I don't remember it enough, though. How could I forget this? I love Hoodoo.

168
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:31,619
Bypass. Manhattan. Degroud Key was... It's better than Steel, and it's better than... Yeah, it's not

169
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,940
like it's better than Kong King, though. Tsukimaki. Junction. Don't like it at all.

170
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:43,400
Better than Steel, though. And better than Degroud Key. Vanguard. I don't... Powerhouse,

171
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:51,109
I don't... I played it, but I don't... Not enough. What's the one with the two that cross in the

172
00:29:51,109 --> 00:30:07,059
middle? The payload war. Is that Nightfall? That's Nightfall, right? Better than Granary. I had fun

173
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:14,390
on it. Same with Pipeline. I don't remember which one I like more. A lot of you were waiting for

174
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:26,119
this one. I have days and days, probably dozens and dozens and dozens of days played on Gold Rush.

175
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:36,259
So much time just doing the same thing, but it was so fun. That's the thing with Team Fortress 2

176
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:42,900
that no game since has been able to do, and that's doing the same fucking thing every time you play

177
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:52,579
was always fun because there were so many variables in the game to make it so it didn't matter that

178
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:56,819
the same goal was happening. There were so many things happening inside of that game.

179
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:12,970
Nobody's been able to do it since. Not sad music. Well, it should be. Building a century in TF2

180
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:21,099
in the same spot in Gold Rush. I know where it is. I can see it. Hundreds of times. Every single time

181
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:35,960
was fun. Every time. That's not the same for other games. Even when Overwatch came out and I played

182
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,319
Overwatch, the thing that really grabbed me in Overwatch that I really, really liked, I thought

183
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:51,349
it was really, really awesome, was the pig guy. What was his name? Hogwash? What's the guy's name?

184
00:31:54,119 --> 00:32:03,319
Roadhog. The chain was, I loved it. I loved it. I loved the chain so much. And Zenyatta's orbs.

185
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,920
Putting the healing orb on people and the chain where those do it every single time, do it every

186
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:15,099
single game. And it's always fun. But it was the only two things that I really can pull out that

187
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:24,869
I thought were that fun. And maybe running around as Lucio. But something about the maps and how

188
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:34,619
messy it got. It got real messy. TF2 got messy. But not like shields and everywhere. There's a

189
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:45,079
million people. It's like less people but more bullshit. It's just kind of hard to look at

190
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:53,670
sometimes. You could have 30 people in a TF2 server and you would still almost be at the crest

191
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,829
of the amount of just weird bullshit on the screen that happens with one 5v5 Overwatch match.

192
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:09,670
Nobody's been able to really come that close. Overwatch was really damn close though.

193
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,710
I had a lot of fun playing the first four or five months of that game. I really did.

194
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:21,180
But it just didn't hold me. It held me for about six months. And then I was like,

195
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,859
but that's still... I mean in the grand scheme of things. Playing a game for like

196
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:35,700
four or five six months straight. I mean that's pretty good. I would have loved to have it hold

197
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:46,099
me forever. Held me for about three or four months. Same. Yeah. I think that's really what

198
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,460
it comes down to that's wrong with Overwatch. There's only 12 people in an Overwatch game.

199
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,460
But there's 10 times more bullshit than having 60 people be in a TF2 game.

200
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:04,710
I mean you can make fun of Valve as much as you want. But they took almost a decade to make this

201
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,590
game. Changing things. Redoing things. They took almost 10 fucking years to make this. So it had

202
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:23,530
everything they wanted. The classics will always remain timeless. Yeah. But TF2 is probably the

203
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:30,980
last game that I really really wanted to play every day. Feels bad, man. Feels bad, man.

204
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:43,929
Because now this stuff holds my... Pay no attention to that. Stuff holds my attention now.

205
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:50,650
Like I'm sure a lot of you can agree. But I'm not into the... I'm really not into VR at all.

206
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,650
And that's what's currently like holding a bunch of people's attention is like stuff like Fortnite,

207
00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:01,610
Apex, the Call of Duty stuff. I just don't... It doesn't do it for me. Same thing with MOBAs too.

208
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,179
Smite was probably the last one that I thought was actually pretty fun. But like Beta Smite. And

209
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:12,619
like maybe just barely after release Smite was awesome. And then I don't know. I wasn't really

210
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,940
into it after a while. Same deal like another like four to six months and that was it. I gave up on

211
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:29,690
it. Beta Smite was perfect. It was so good. VR is just temporary fad. It will die in the next few

212
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:37,530
years. I'm not so sure about that. People were saying that when stuff like DayZ was kind of

213
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,690
getting to be really popular and they were like ah this is this is just fad. This would be gone

214
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:53,460
in a few years. And then Fortnite is still huge. PUBG. Yeah PUBG came after DayZ. And I wish I...

215
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,170
I wish I liked those games. I really do. Because I would be playing them. And like stuff like

216
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,969
Counter-Strike is always going to be around. CS GO is just always going to be popular. It's a

217
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:11,369
high kind of skill ceiling team FPS. I mean people love CS GO. I just... Not for me.

218
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:22,539
Never played Tribes Ascend. Yes it was fantastic. Hi-Rez did this really really great

219
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:30,300
job on the first like six months of their games being released. And then they kind of didn't...

220
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,949
They went to shit. The first like four to six months of Tribes Ascend. What an un-fucking

221
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:41,349
believable experience. The first like four to six months of Smite. What an un-fucking believable

222
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:53,610
experience. I think that Hi-Rez has made like just base video game has made some of the better

223
00:36:53,610 --> 00:37:02,260
video games in the last decade. Like just straight up just like Tribes Ascend as a video game.

224
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,099
Forget about like any patches of what they did. But like when that first released

225
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:19,619
it was amazing. Video game. Video game. Video game. When they made a video game. All right I'm

226
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:27,349
gonna get back to this. Hi-Rez abandoned their games. I don't think... No they didn't. They just

227
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:31,269
focused on other stuff. They kind of spread themselves out. Focused on the new thing. Focused

228
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:43,849
on the new thing. No they... Well they did... Yeah Tribes. Yeah you're right. They did. They kind of

229
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:57,179
just gave up on Tribes. They actually abandoned Tribes. Yes they did. If Tribes got the same kind

230
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:11,800
of TF2 treatment I would probably still be playing it. Anyways let's continue. Dirty Bomb. I actually

231
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,179
never played Dirty Bomb. Maybe for like a... No I never played Dirty Bomb. I remember. I couldn't

232
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:24,460
install it. What happened? Some of you guys might remember this. This was on stream like six years

233
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:31,340
ago. What happened? Remember? Who was around for that? I tried to play it. I got like locked out.

234
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:38,550
I couldn't install it. Me and Star were playing it. Like he was playing it. I was just watching

235
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:50,139
this. I couldn't install it. You made a meme during Star's video about what a shitty dream

236
00:38:50,139 --> 00:39:02,789
playing Dirty Bomb would be. I don't remember. I don't remember. I never played Lawbreakers. No.

237
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:08,309
Because I saw the writing on the wall with Lawbreakers from the second they announced it.

238
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,989
I knew if I got into it that the thing was just going to be dead anyways. Like I just knew I could

239
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:21,340
see it from a mile away. That first gameplay trailer I was like that's probably going to be

240
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:30,659
a failure. But it looks... I'm not going to invest into that. Because if you do... Let's say you

241
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,780
invest a shitload of time into a game. Like this probably people that... That's not to say I don't

242
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,739
think the game was any good. I don't have an opinion. I can't have an opinion on it because

243
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:42,260
I didn't play it. But if you really liked Lawbreakers, you were a huge fan of Lawbreakers.

244
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,380
That got to hurt if you were one of the people that like really cared about that game.

245
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,429
And you put a bunch of time into it. And you played a bunch of it. And then they're just like

246
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:04,039
yeah that's it. Like oh well fuck I really liked this. Halo on PC in two weeks. That's another

247
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:11,579
thing to be excited for. If you're one of the 19 players. That's mean. That's mean. Oh Joel's in

248
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:17,559
the chat. Joel's in the chat. What's up Joel? What do you... What do you got? You got something for me?

249
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:38,199
Huh? Hmm. Why you not VIP'd so I could like see what you're writing? VIP Varg Skelethor.

250
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:58,019
That's correct right? Varg Skelethor. All right what's up? Would you be up for playing

251
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:09,159
Tribes Ascend with our viewers? Let's revive it man. We have the power. Is the game still turned on?

252
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:24,059
The switch is still on in that game. Is it? Yeah is it? Did they turn off the servers? Why do I

253
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:42,380
feel like they did? I would I would play Tribes. What's your schedule look like? It's unlisted on

254
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:58,840
Steam. Is it unlisted? I think you have to get it right from Hi-Rez right? Play Titanfall 2 instead.

255
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:15,139
Hey hit me DM me on Discord. We'll talk about it. Titanfall 2 is good. Titanfall 2 campaign.

256
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:31,429
What you want to do the Titanfall 2 co-op campaign? Does that exist? That doesn't exist right?

257
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:38,519
There's no co-op. Oh the game sucks then. All right let me finish this up but hit me up. I'll

258
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,679
message you on Discord. I also heard you watched my 3d movie maker thing. It was fucking fantastic.

259
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,179
Seriously it was fucking great. I loved every second of it. When we watch it in the future?

260
00:42:51,179 --> 00:43:00,099
Oh I will. What better time to watch Joel's movie than when he's here?

261
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:08,969
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Joel he's got to go. He just said he

262
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:15,500
had to leave. Joel what you got an appointment? He just said in the chat I've got a I've got an

263
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:30,090
appointment I have to get to. I need to respect that. What's a ping like from Sweden to Nevada?

264
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:43,619
Yes my appointment at 4am. See can we like even play games together? Oh we're gonna have like

265
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:55,659
700 ping. Sorry you can host. I'll take the disadvantage. You know what I mean? Madagascar

266
00:43:55,659 --> 00:44:03,860
lion move. All right fast lane I don't know. Surgeon I don't know. Swift water pretty good.

267
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Double cross not good. Foundry don't like it. But not yeah it's actually except everything's

268
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:26,780
better than steel. So cold front yeah that goes up here. Pretty good map. High pass I don't remember

269
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:36,090
really. I don't but I probably should. Gullywash I don't remember. I do though. It's been a long

270
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:45,980
time. Mountain lab I really did not like mountain lab. Thought it was too. Moss rock don't know.

271
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:55,659
Gravel pit. One of the only maps with more than two points that's going to be up past AB. Ghost

272
00:44:55,659 --> 00:45:00,300
town don't know. Standen don't know. Decoy I don't know. Metalworks I have no idea. Coaltown don't

273
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,340
know. Snowy coast probably played it maybe once. Manworks don't remember. Enclosure don't remember.

274
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:13,780
Yukon don't remember. Yeah I do but it wasn't very good. Freight no. Sunshine don't know. Landfall

275
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:21,260
don't know. Big rock don't know. Brickyard don't know. Okay let's get this right. Best map in the

276
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:43,940
whole game. The best team fortress 2 map is gorge. Then thunder mountain. Then gold rush. Then dust

277
00:45:43,940 --> 00:46:07,030
bowl. Then upward. Then hoodoo. Then nucleus. Then harvard. Then frontier. No front no. Then

278
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:22,519
bat no. Then bad water. Then borneo. Then barn blitz. Then gravel pit. Then high tower. No then

279
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:30,199
lakeside no. Lakeside sucks actually get it down here. Um then viaduct. Then high tower. Then

280
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:41,219
turbine. Then twofort. Then nightfall. Cold front is better than twofort. Lakeside is better than

281
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:48,949
pipeline and nightfall. Swift water is better than all these I remember. Process is probably

282
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:54,309
better than this. Five gorge is still gorge so it belongs at least in head granary. Uh the rest of

283
00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:01,239
these can stay in the same spot. What is the worst map that I've played in team fortress 2? It is

284
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:08,969
probably it's steel. Steel junction are the two worst. Double cross is also awful because it's

285
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:13,610
that big road with the one way to get in. You have to go down. Yeah double cross is terrible.

286
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:27,739
Um digroot keep. Mountain lab should be down here too. Better than digroot. No it's not. Hydro.

287
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:48,090
Doomsday sucks. Doomsday really sucks. And it's not even the map's fault. It's the terrible

288
00:47:48,090 --> 00:48:01,820
game mode that it's on. Last. Doomsday is worse than steel. I don't know though. I don't think

289
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:13,750
it's the worst thing in the whole game. I'm trying to think if I see it pop up in the server changing

290
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,730
map loading screen. How fast am I leaving? It's pretty close probably. I don't want to play

291
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:28,460
doomsday. Digroot keep as well. I just don't want to play it. It was fun for like a week or two and

292
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,659
it was melee only. Storm the castle was fun but not after like a month. You just don't want to

293
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:46,659
play it anymore. Uh I think this is good. Yukon is okay. Yukon actually is kind of good.

294
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:57,239
Yeah Yukon's actually all right. Yukon actually I'm remembering now actually Yukon should probably

295
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:05,510
be up here. Yukon's better than these two. Is Yukon better than the lakeside though?

296
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:24,739
No that's actually worse than pipeline. Okay so that's it. I'm good. Here's your list. Hydro never

297
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:32,230
got a chance. I'd still rather play Hydro than steel. I'd rather play Hydro than Egypt. No that's

298
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:41,340
not true. I'd rather play Egypt than Hydro. I'd rather play Kong King than Hydro. Guys I really

299
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:55,539
want to bring all and I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Yeah I'm gonna bring every five CP map down

300
00:49:55,539 --> 00:50:14,710
to F. I would rather play Egypt than well CP. I'd rather play Kong King than five gorge. Goodbye.

301
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:38,469
Sawmill Coff is okay and stay. Lakeside where are we at? Swiftwater process.

302
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:46,360
I just would not play it. Sawmill's capture the flag is just turtle mania. You just get two

303
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,679
engineers that sit in the room. The fucking tiny little room that you get the actual briefcase from

304
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:54,280
and they just have two engineers there. And nope you can't win. Nobody you can't play the game.

305
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:06,500
So it's not right. I hate it. Ah now I gotta fix this. I'd rather play Sawmill King of the Hill

306
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:12,329
than these two. I'd rather play Yukon than those two. I'd rather play I don't have any E's left.

307
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:23,019
Yes I will. Kong King, Hydro all the way to the bottom. I would definitely not rather play

308
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:32,360
Mountain Lab. Sawmill capture the flag I'd rather do besides the like competitive five CP maps.

309
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:42,300
Let's get these all the way at the bottom where they belong though. Five gorge is gorge so it

310
00:51:42,300 --> 00:52:02,949
gets to be up to the highest. There you go. Wait I'd rather play Snakewater and Swiftwater

311
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:19,960
than Pipeline and Nightfall. They belong down here. They're trash. They're not good. Done. No.

312
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:36,469
I hate Egypt but I don't mind it. All right it's official. It's official. There you are.

313
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:58,500
I'll go slow so you can see. I'm malding right now from this list. Well look everybody knows

314
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:05,929
just everybody. Oops don't break anything. Sorry I was doing like the like I'm a magician like

315
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:12,570
magic act with my hands. Um everybody these the S and from S to B everybody loves these.

316
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,610
Maybe you don't have them in the same spot but this is like these are the top maps of the game.

317
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:27,929
I think that's a pretty fair S through B. I just don't like five CP and that's my preference you

318
00:53:27,929 --> 00:53:34,969
know. I'm a king of the hill and a uh attack defense in payload. Mostly king of the hill in

319
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:43,260
payload. Two fourths too high. That's just because I have a love-hate relationship with

320
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:54,300
it. Same with Dustbowl. What's next? This is fun. This is like I'm having this is chill man. This

321
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:16,659
is cool. I haven't met anyone ever that likes Turbine. German tier list? No I remember that

322
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:27,460
from last time. I'm not doing it. Full metal alchemist characters. I don't think oh Bloodborne

323
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:33,539
trick weapons. Hell yeah. Let's do this one. Spoilers for Bloodborne if you've never seen it.

324
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:50,980
Does this have the DLC in it too? Uh okay let's go. All right man now this is not what I think the

325
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:59,909
best weapon in the game is. This is what I think I like to play with the most. Fuck the cane.

326
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:08,820
I hate the cane. Uh it's gonna be tricky. Where's the where's the where's the moonlit sword?

327
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:22,469
Is that is that the moonlit sword? Uh I desperately tried to get this

328
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:30,260
but I didn't I I gave up. Making a magic character in Bloodborne was

329
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:37,059
just I hate it. I am having just all arcane. You get like two or three different options.

330
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:55,559
I wish I could use it. I haven't I can't use it. This thing was good but I wouldn't want to use

331
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,880
it the whole time. The whirligig saw was I mean just cool but I wouldn't want to use it.

332
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:07,559
Uh I never got a chance to use the bow so I'm just gonna never done it. I have to make a new

333
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:17,289
category. All right D is the category I have never used it. Where's the my favorite weapon?

334
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:26,550
There it is. I love this thing. The big like chain swing weapon. Oh this is the side right?

335
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:41,980
Where's the bow? Am I stupid? This is it right here. That's the bow right? Yeah I never played

336
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:52,550
with the side. I did use the wheel for a little bit but it was bad. It was fun for a little bit.

337
00:56:53,269 --> 00:57:01,179
Uh I didn't. Where's this the the best the best weapon in the game? This one right here right?

338
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:20,730
All these were good. Bad. The saw spear. I have that. Is that incorrect? Oh that's the wrong one

339
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:32,599
yeah. These are all great. These are boring choices. I know but this is not this is not a boring

340
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:38,469
choice. This is like one of the cool DLC weapons. Pizza cutter is better than the saw spear. Yeah

341
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:43,590
also I like this too. This was a lot of fun to use because you could actually play for the first

342
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:52,469
like two-thirds of the game with arcane. Uh this one was cool but not that useful. This is the um

343
00:57:52,469 --> 00:58:00,170
that weird arm weapon. Yeah we're gonna put we'll put the boring ones down here. I mean these are

344
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:12,059
just like those are the best weapons but they're boring. I did never use the blood uh tinge weapons.

345
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,019
Although I did I actually used this one for a little while. This is a strength one.

346
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:25,849
It was all right. The boom hammer sucks. It's like it's probably worse than the cane.

347
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:36,920
It's fun to use. Uh this one I'm gonna put it down here because every single person that ever plays

348
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,480
Bloodborne uses this weapon for the whole game. I was one of them on my first playthrough. Um it's

349
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,159
either this one or this one. I'm gonna put them down here. So I just imagine like I didn't play

350
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:57,429
with these. They're fantastic weapons but like everybody plays with them. So actually you know

351
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:05,000
they actually belong up here with the boring ones because they just be they're just good. Now the

352
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,639
gun blade stuff is something that I have no experience with because I never really did it.

353
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,349
This is the weird hand arm thing. I thought it wasn't I hated this thing. You have to get

354
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:20,309
that one specific holding R2 with the little arm comes out and stabs him the head. It's hard to use.

355
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:32,440
I know this is probably the best weapon at least from the DLC in the game but I would probably

356
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:42,659
rather use all these instead of the the default ones and this too. This is just fun. That arm

357
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:47,139
is god tier. Yeah but it's just I didn't like using it. It was like the boom hammer. It was that one

358
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:53,750
gimmick with the little thing that comes out. Like this has a gimmick but I can still use it as like

359
00:59:53,750 --> 01:00:02,889
a sword. I know this is a club too. This makes me want to play the game again for like the

360
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:10,059
sixth time. How do I fast forward to the next list? It'll be done very soon don't worry.

361
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:17,030
Um I don't remember these. The gun spear I don't know. I didn't really use them.

362
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:23,139
No. If I ever played through Bloodborne again I would use one of these weapons.

363
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:28,840
This is the these things were awesome and I remember getting so angry trying to get these.

364
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,480
The maddest I've ever been probably in a video game. Spoiler alert for the DLC.

365
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,159
When you go like just mute the stream fucking hurry up.

366
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:48,860
Getting this weapon was one of the most rage inducing moments ever. This is the the dual

367
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:56,460
blades thing that you get but there's two of those weird huge sliding shark face monster people down

368
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:08,659
there. Wrong weapon? Wait is it? No it's not. No it's not. This is the the the dual weapons right?

369
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:14,170
No right right right right right right. The one that's down there. Which one is it?

370
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:19,769
This is that's the crow. Yeah right right right. Stay muted. We're talking about spoilers here.

371
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:25,610
Yes that's a crow. That's this one. What it's the which one is it? It's this one here right?

372
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:39,429
Yeah okay and I wanted to use it because it was so interesting so cool but those trying to fight

373
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:44,389
those two things at the same time was so painful. All right now you can unmute but holy shit that

374
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:51,929
was I remember being so angry at that game fighting two of those things. Shaman bone I know

375
01:01:51,929 --> 01:02:00,099
but holy fuck I if you don't know that you are in deep shit. I love Bloodborne but haven't used

376
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:08,019
like half the weapons. Isn't that part of the fun? Isn't part of like oh okay playthrough one used

377
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:11,059
uh let's see what I'll go through every playthrough. You ready?

378
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,099
First playthrough of Bloodborne. So take your screenshot this is what I have to say okay now

379
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:23,909
this is the first playthrough up here. This is my first playthrough. I use these two. Second

380
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:27,510
playthrough. Vita holy shit this game's fucking like game best game I've ever played my whole life.

381
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:35,059
Second playthrough. These two. Oh wow this is amazing. So much fun. Third playthrough.

382
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:43,340
I was I think I was just like a normal asshole. Third playthrough I remember specifically

383
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:52,699
desperately wanting to get this and I think I probably used I think I actually used the hammer

384
01:02:54,219 --> 01:03:00,780
and then I gave up at like the spoiler alert. If you give up at this point here you've already

385
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:07,340
played through the whole damn game. I just spoiled it whatever. Yes yes because I got to the point

386
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:13,219
where I was trying to fight orphan with a fucking boom hammer and I was like this is like this is

387
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:27,639
not possible to do. I'm done. Quick remute. Okay so that's playthrough number one two three four.

388
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,320
Playthrough number five. I did a let's do I did like a comedy playthrough so I wanted this is

389
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:46,010
these are the two I did. Done. I've played through the game like five times. I mean I've I used these

390
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:55,800
which have I not actually physically touched. Everything down here is what I have not even

391
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:04,010
physically used. Oh no no no no no this this is up this was during the comedy run. This is what I

392
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:17,349
ended up with during like the strength comedy run. Okay yeah I have not equipped any of the

393
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:21,349
weapons below because I didn't I like didn't have time wasn't doing the build or didn't want to use

394
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:32,889
it. Show us your saves to prove this. I have not had this PlayStation 4 in probably three and a

395
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:45,960
half years. What about the steak driver? Where is it? It's uh the oh right yeah okay yeah sorry sorry

396
01:04:45,960 --> 01:05:03,769
I've used it but maybe for like 30 minutes. Can I unmute? You can yes unmute. You played the game

397
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:08,650
five times and never touched half the weapons? I mean I physically maybe had them in my inventory

398
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:14,650
but I never used them because you have to level up stuff. You have to upgrade your weapons and I

399
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:19,130
just was like I don't feel like using that. That's kind of cool you know you get a weapon in these

400
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:25,849

this for a long time animals at the zoo that's actually pretty fucking sick I'm gonna do animals

489
01:29:13,750 --> 01:30:02,979
at the zoo this is gonna be tricky this is actually gonna be very hard to do uh all right

490
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:10,180
you're gonna but why why are why are tigers and cats so low because it's that and like dogs like

491
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:16,460
wolves are low too just because that's not that big it's like not that big of a deal to see like

492
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:22,600
a lot like a tiger at a zoo like a lion at the zoo that's if you saw an armadillo or like a

493
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,000
monitor lizard at the zoo that's pretty cool I mean it's cool but I don't know that I don't

494
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,760
hate that I think it's interesting a pig at the zoo but pigs are like one of my favorite animals

495
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:39,720
these are awesome yes I know but if I'm going to the zoo I'm going right to the pig den

496
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,920
it's hard to it's hard to put any of these in the hate category I don't hate any of these animals

497
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:21,079
no I don't I don't hate otter no I don't hate any of these how could you hate something like this

498
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,380

01:39:58,899 --> 01:40:06,920
yeah I'm gonna have one of these before I before I die I will make a promise to me before the day

538
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:16,100
I die I'm going to own a like two to three foot long fucking monitor lizard maybe not a monitor

539
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:24,149
but like at least a one to two foot long lizard like a tegu or a maybe even a monitor

540
01:40:24,789 --> 01:40:39,460
before the day I die they're so interesting tegu is the way to go monitors suck I've been in my

541
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:53,739
research tegus are huge yeah I know I know okay ostrich platypus what a cool animal that god just

542
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:56,779
said fuck it and like threw a bunch of shit in a blender and then dumped it on the ground like

543
01:40:56,779 --> 01:41:04,020
that's so what an awesome what an interesting animal the god was late for class and like had

544
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:19,609
to do his homework real quick uh yeah cool one of the coolest animals on earth these huge birds are

545
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:25,109
just so interesting too what are you doing up here get out of here oh wait that's an otter

546
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:51,270
yeah I think otters are cooler than the omega pig titan pig evolution but I still love them peacock

547
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:59,989
is gonna come down a little uh orang-tangs are awesome gorillas are really really cool uh iguanas

548
01:42:01,579 --> 01:42:07,560
alligators are fucking cool too though I wouldn't put them I would rather go look at a giraffe and

549
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:24,939
an elephant than an alligator though because they kind of just stand around they just sit there I

550
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:34,619
don't think that's fair I would just look at the snake for 15 seconds the snakes don't do anything

551
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:46,100
alligators don't do anything but they're huge monitors are actually really interesting they

552
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:53,210
run around they stay like they like have their big tongues that come out they like look at you

553
01:42:53,210 --> 01:43:04,199
they're they're very very excited what a way cooler version of a lion this is a lion with scales

554
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:23,479
and a big tongue that comes up they have chain male skeletons that's wow that's pretty dope

555
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:37,659
okay but I don't really snakes don't I love reptiles and amphibians but snakes don't do

556
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:42,939
it for me they they're really really cool they're really interesting they have a lot of really

557
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:55,210
they have great designs on their skin and stuff and so many different types they have some fun

558
01:43:55,210 --> 01:44:16,060
personalities uh they're not really plus they're the devil that should be down here guys I'm sorry

559
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:20,550
if you can walk into a pet smart and see this that's not something that's that cool to look

560
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:32,020
at at the zoo they're different don't I don't hate any none of these animals I love all of

561
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:48,710
these animals all of them it's just who I prefer then put them under love but that's not how a

562
01:44:48,710 --> 01:45:10,550
tier list works okay let's keep this going I want to get this right s is correct uh a is needs a

563
01:45:10,550 --> 01:46:08,460
little bit of work that's correct yeah that's correct it's even more correct close done all

564
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:25,859
right down if they like ah these are cool I like these animals they're pretty cool the only reason

565
01:46:25,859 --> 01:46:31,880
why people really like these is because they're in a bunch of animated movies and then everything

566
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:38,010
that they always just show up for like a minute corals are fucking horrible animals they have one

567
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:42,890
of the smallest brains to body ratios of any mammal additionally their brains are smooth the

568
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:49,399
brain is folded to increase the surface for neurons if you present a koala if you present

569
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:57,079
a koala with leaves plucked from a branch laid on a flat surface the koala will not recognize it as

570
01:46:57,079 --> 01:47:07,380
food they are too thick to adapt their feeding behavior to cope with change in a room full of

571
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:29,430
food they can literally starve to death so what is that they're stupid as fuck they only survive

572
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:34,390
because their food what was it they only survive because they're because their food makes them

573
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:43,819
poisonous but look at their ears they should be extinct holy shit that's rough

574
01:47:44,539 --> 01:47:56,090
flamingo is pretty cool dolphins I mean just dolphins should probably be up there yeah yeah

575
01:47:56,090 --> 01:48:25,220
yeah bump bump bump bump bump bump I mean camels are cool though camel cool than a polar bear

576
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:51,000
polar bear cooler than a buff fox what's this one this is pixar fox versus hbo fox which one you

577
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:19,590
don't know what a red panda is apparently not and for that reason I'm out I'll take the pixar fox

578
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:27,140
over the fox it's cool kind of cool than an iguana is it though they both belong up here

579
01:49:27,939 --> 01:49:42,220
no they don't koala brain no I thought I would I eat food if it's in front of me

580
01:49:46,569 --> 01:49:57,979
okay there's the rest of this correct almost yeah yeah yeah I guess no I would rather see these

581
01:49:57,979 --> 01:50:07,460
no I'd rather like see a koala though I never get to see them okay would look for 15 seconds

582
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:26,859
who would I look for 16 seconds vultures and then the lions because there you go to the lions and

583
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:37,399
you see the lions that's not a vulture what it's an anteater it's not like a like wings laid out

584
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:44,920
like like this going down assume like it's wings up see like wing up wing up just swooped down

585
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:49,159
landing grabbing something this is okay wrong that's an anteater all right those things are

586
01:50:49,159 --> 01:50:58,600
awesome uh all right I would look for 15 seconds at the lion probably the most and then honestly

587
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:02,520
probably the turtle my reasoning for that is I would just open up my phone and it's this would

588
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,630
be where like I would be texting somebody I could probably sit there for like five straight minutes

589
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:18,890
this is my I'm taking a break section of the zoo I'd be there for 15 seconds uh it's a bobcat

590
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:31,189
slightly larger than house cat cat cool and they've got the bear beards and stuff I love them

591
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:56,229
that's a lynx isn't a link wait what do you mean it's a lynx the lynx is known by the tuft of black

592
01:51:56,229 --> 01:52:01,989
hair on the tips of its ears and it's short of bobbed tail in fact one species of lynx is called

593
01:52:04,739 --> 01:52:22,220
a bobcat fucking stupid goddamn fucking stupid fucking idiot fucking goddamn one species

594
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:39,979
it's still correct and for that go get a haircut that one isn't the bobcat lynxes are a bobcat

595
01:52:39,979 --> 01:52:46,300
a bobcat is a lynx it's that's a bobcat it could be a bobcat just because it's a specific lynx it

596
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:50,539
could be a bobcat bobcat is a lynx lynx is a bobcat there's a species that is the bobcat

597
01:52:50,539 --> 01:53:05,939
they're not entered not all lynx is a bobcat but not all but all bobcats are lynxes thank you uh

598
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:33,050
thank you appreciate it thank you can we disagree that the t-rex food is down here all right I would

599
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:37,770
look at a whale for 15 seconds I would probably weigh more than a lion all right let's finish

600
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:48,279
this up let's go with just a manatee cool you don't have to go to the zoo just live in maine

601
01:53:48,279 --> 01:53:59,529
and look out your window they're huge and they're majestic but I don't not that big whatever I'm

602
01:53:59,529 --> 01:54:05,210
not sure what this is just a horse or is it a zebra why the what's it what is this animal

603
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:19,239
why does it has a saddle on it that's an okapi yeah it's a fucking okapi of the zebra I'm so

604
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:35,380
sorry I'm sorry I have a hundred people leave I get it they have blue tongues

605
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:54,970
I think I'm good I think this is the list but which one of the cats besides a lion would I

606
01:54:54,970 --> 01:55:06,779
want to see the most it probably that or that no that no no this is just a chat just that's

607
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:32,069
just a tiger right this is just that's that's a tiger I would pretty I would like to see that

butter bread I don't think I've ever had this before yeast bread I butter bread butter bread

636
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:35,109
and what did yeast bread go it's just that just bread all right let's fix this I potato bread

637
02:02:35,909 --> 02:02:42,300
pretzel bread I don't know how you could eat potato bread or pretzel bread and say that's

638
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:51,449
not the best thing I've ever had in my life that was made from bread huh I don't know you know

639
02:02:51,449 --> 02:02:56,250
what I'm trying to say uh banana bread doesn't belong up here it was it that was a knee-jerk

640
02:02:56,250 --> 02:03:13,079
reaction it should be this close it's a plus plus Hawaiian rolls better than rye pita bread

641
02:03:13,079 --> 02:03:21,560
better than rye cord bread and rye are above the same naan and pita bread fantastic tortilla

642
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:29,609
flat I would actually put flat bread up above rye and we're gonna put we're gonna put rye down

643
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:38,039
here I'd rather have flour tortilla than rye garlic bread it's good but it's just a bit basic

644
02:03:38,039 --> 02:03:47,220
it is I this is like snack bread it's just it's snack bread garlic bread breadsticks

645
02:03:47,779 --> 02:03:57,109
it's good it's very good it's exceptional but I mean it's it's good but it's snack bread

646
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:01,579
snacks are good yes they are but would I rather have garlic bread or would I rather have

647
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:10,420
a nice french bread like with oil that's the top tier snack bread I thought I would rather have

648
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:14,659
no I would rather have bagel than garlic bread you have to be in the mood for you got to be in the

649
02:04:14,659 --> 02:04:24,579
mood for garlic bread it's very heavy like really dense and cheesy sometimes and really heavy garlic

650
02:04:24,579 --> 02:04:39,340
and oil it's not a light snack crude oil what the fuck are you talking about what kind of garlic

651
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:46,310
bread are you guys eating that isn't like soaked in oil and cheese that's how you make garlic bread

652
02:04:46,310 --> 02:05:00,310
you put a bunch of garlic and oil on it no cheese on garlic bread it's still got oil on it you eat

653
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:03,350
what you don't have you don't put oil on your garlic bread what do you just put a clove of

654
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:19,500
garlic on a piece of bread and eat it where the fuck is their cheese on garlic bread I feel like

684
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:11,689
going through the list I bought a potato bread is my favorite thing that's like it's like my

685
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:17,050
favorite thing in the world I don't think zucchini bread is s-tier banana look at banana bread though

686
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:38,170
he's not I'm not no I it's it's better than white bread it was stress burp I'm done this is

687
02:12:38,170 --> 02:12:52,329
correct I'm done perhaps a bad croissant potato bread whatever the music was I listened to chill

688
02:12:52,329 --> 02:13:01,340
I listen I'm in a fucking time machine that was a two hour long playlist didn't I just click the

689
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:17,399

691
02:13:33,029 --> 02:13:43,399
zucchini bread oh he's going Larry David but all right hold on a second here Kim you're telling me

692
02:13:43,399 --> 02:13:50,979
that zucchini bread is better than crusties with oil that's like one of my favorite things guy

693
02:13:50,979 --> 02:14:00,390
that's gonna be up there bagels like a nice crunchy crispy bagel but we're talking about

694
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:05,109
zucchini bread like from the store I would not buy zucchini bread from the store but if Kim made

695
02:14:05,109 --> 02:14:13,880
it it's actually really good no joke no fucking around and did I just replay the chill step mix

696
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:28,890
I think it's time to go zucchini bread is better than sourdough and pumpernickel I didn't even get

697
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:34,409
down here yet I didn't even get down to this portion I just they were they were in a row

698
02:14:35,289 --> 02:14:44,060
to be fair though I've had zucchini bread twice once from Kim once from my mother and they were

699
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:48,859
great but I don't like I'm not gonna put a I'm not gonna put like turkey on a zucchini sandwich

736
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:27,559
to you especially initially a lot of stuff to look at a lot of things going on a lot of places to go

737
02:22:27,559 --> 02:22:34,520
a lot of food to eat just take it slow one step at a time take it in very small baby steps it's

738
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:42,579
a great city I love it dark soul thanks for the 250 70 hour work week coming up it's the last

739
02:22:42,579 --> 02:22:48,260
biddies for a while also while I hate playing internet doctor have you been tested for celiac

740
02:22:48,899 --> 02:22:54,420
I have causes an autoimmune reaction in your stomach and small intestines yes I have been

741
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:58,659
tested for celiac that's initially what I thought was going on but that's not what's going on

742
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:06,280
70 hours though yeah that is a long fucking time hope you get some time off after that

743
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:34,729
70 I really do hope you get some time off though it's never fun to have to spend

744
02:23:34,729 --> 02:23:45,079
over over over time you can get really over tired but uh yeah in regards to medical stuff

745
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:53,110
I'm still trying to figure it out I have some idea but I don't really there's not much to talk

746
02:23:53,110 --> 02:23:58,469
about because I have another procedure that's coming up to try to really put the nail in the

747
02:23:58,469 --> 02:24:04,260
coffin here so it's not like I'm gonna be like hey guys let's talk about my last visit and the

748
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:10,180
visit before that the visit before it no it's it's not worth really talking about it isn't

749
02:24:11,379 --> 02:24:19,700
but it is not celiac kind of at some point over the last seven or eight months wish it was that

750
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:26,659
easy to be honest because it's been sort of just a random uh symptomatic of what's wrong with me

751
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:33,559
so it's not enough to cause any concern though it's just like an irritating little thing that's

752
02:24:33,559 --> 02:24:46,389
just sticking around not enough to cause a problem but it's enough to be annoying I should have a

753
02:24:46,389 --> 02:24:56,379

putting a bounty on the king's head that's fine yeah I you don't think I what do you mean you

814
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:14,329
don't think I've got a vault full of gold behind me somebody comes in with the bow pointed at my

815
02:35:14,329 --> 02:35:18,889
head I'll double it what do you pay what are you getting paid I'll double it no no no fuck that

816
02:35:18,889 --> 02:35:31,299
I'll triple it go back and and kill the man that sent you and I want proof bring me his diamond

817
02:35:31,299 --> 02:35:48,569
pickaxe oh snoozing copter thanks for the 250 the video game tier list was a really nice trip down

818
02:35:48,569 --> 02:35:54,409
memory lane bloodborne and tf2 were the two games I would spend a ton of money on for a mind eraser

819
02:35:54,409 --> 02:36:03,540
frog yeah imagine picking up team fortress 2 for the first time ever right now you just there's so

820
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:09,930
much to see I feel like it would actually be hard though because we got all that stuff trickled in

821
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:17,579
over years it's almost like the game has changed a lot since then it would be it might be actually

822
02:36:17,579 --> 02:36:29,110
pretty difficult but god I wish that they would just make team fortress colon man versus machine

823
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:37,430
only I would have loved them to just to make just a just I'll pay for it I'll buy it just

824
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:50,120
let's sell it to me I'll it's 40 39.99 59.99 I'll buy it I just give it to me overwatch 2 is doing

825
02:36:50,120 --> 02:37:05,139
that we don't know that for certain though we know it's a pve game like that but is it going

826
02:37:05,139 --> 02:37:10,899
to be as good as man versus machine was will it be as challenging will it be as fun will it be as

827
02:37:10,899 --> 02:37:22,250
much stuff to upgrade and enough enough in it see that's what I mean we don't know I'm not willing

828
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:32,729
to judge until something's around you know I'm saying hey I just made uh I just made a burger

829
02:37:32,729 --> 02:37:39,430
and I think the salad I used is a bit old three months old we don't eat it just eat the burger

830
02:37:46,469 --> 02:37:52,620
but uh it's been years since I played the dlc in bloodborne and here comes a bloodborne spoiler

831
02:37:53,579 --> 02:37:58,629
close your ears if you haven't played it yet here it comes three two one I still haven't beaten the

832
02:37:58,629 --> 02:38:03,270
orphan yet I started the dlc in new game plus and later found out that new game plus orphan is

833
02:38:03,270 --> 02:38:12,139
apparently much harder than normal orphan at this point I'll have to see it well a full day to beat

834
02:38:12,139 --> 02:38:28,360
it fuck me I just mute me feel 64 thanks to the five community subs and thank you snoozing

835
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:35,340
copter for the 250 yes orphan was horrendous I still would put him in the top two top three

836
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:44,739
of hardest bosses they've ever made number one is by all means is the final boss in sakiro

837
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:58,180
was insane that last true encounter in sakiro was so much to learn and so much patience

838
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:16,700
it was crazy that was an entire stream wasn't it just to try to beat that final boss

839
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:25,989
I sat there I was at that boss for at least four hours five hours right something like that

840
02:39:26,709 --> 02:39:42,149
was it 50 something attempts 58 60 attempts oh but hey it was I still did it and I still enjoyed it

02:39:44,629 --> 02:39:49,030
