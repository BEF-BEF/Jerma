1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,530
Alright, should we back to normal? You guys can hear me, right?

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:13,720
Should be back to normal. Alright, so what uh...

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,079
Ooh! I know! I know! I know! I know what we can do!

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,350
The reaction test! Remember last night we talked about the reaction test?

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,350
I was gonna prove to you guys that I see the world at 1.14 speed.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:42,119
Okay, where is it? Reaction test. So human benchmark?

7
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:49,350
Let's get the camera back on. Wait, is the camera even gonna be able to work?

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:01:04,329
Let me uh... oh no, it's still this like purple shit.

9
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:10,439
You could just see every individual here. That was disgusting.

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,500
What's the best reaction test? Is that the one?

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:22,250
Or is there a better one? Let's change the title to...

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,810
Well, we'll just hang out. We haven't really... we haven't had a proper

13
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,459
just sit around and chill hang out stream in like a month or two.

14
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:49,480
So how about uh 1.14 brain speed? No one's gonna know what the

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:02:09,240
fuck that even means. Do they have to... do they though?

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,689
All right, so let's get a... let's get the camera back.

17
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,050
I'm like ugly right now though. Should I like... should I really be

18
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:28,419
broadcasting myself to IRL? With the pasted on

19
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:42,039
dog hairs that are on my face right now? You know what I'm saying?

20
00:02:42,039 --> 00:03:05,300
That looks okay. All right, we look... we look terrible.

21
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,759
Let me get that on screen now. This should be just a window, right?

22
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:19,060
What the human benchmark stuff is there? Is there some other cool

23
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:28,120
shit to do? Do a shaving stream? I can't... I don't have like the

24
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:38,229
necessary means to do that. Space bar challenge?

25
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:47,479
All right, so you have to wait for green.

26
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:56,229
So you have to do this five times. Do it over here. I'm not going to

27
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:04,300
shave at my desk. Shave at the desk? No. I'm gonna get in

28
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,740
trouble if I do that. Won't I get in trouble? All right,

29
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:17,420
let's do it. I just want to see what it looked like.

30
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:29,720
Let's see. There's like number memory, react verbal memory, visual memory.

31
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Okay, let's give it a go. Which one is this?

32
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:58,230
Why do I have so many windows open? Which one is the real one?

33
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:05,139
Can I not? Why do I have an Xbox gaming overlay?

34
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:15,220
What the hell are you talking about? Xbox gaming overlay.

35
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:40,860
Let's try it again. There we go. Okay, finally. Move that and move this.

36
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,740
All right, click to start. This is going to see how

37
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,129
fast my reactions are. You're gonna get a fucking bird's eye view of the whole

38
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,740
thing. What's the blue? Oh, fuck. It's the...

39
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:25,079
Here we go. Ready? So when the box turns green, click as quickly as you can.

40
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:42,410
207. 210. That's not bad, is it? 24... That was faster than the last one. How

41
00:06:42,410 --> 00:07:09,100
was that slower? 216. Okay, you're

42
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,699
currently in the top 89 percentile for this test.

43
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:22,149
That means I'm better than 89. That means I'm better than 89 percent.

44
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:29,029
Right? That's pretty good. Let's do it again.

45
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:37,129
Let's do it again. I can get a better one. You ready? It means you're 89.

46
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,810
Three people have taken the test. No, that's like 50,000 people have taken

47
00:07:40,810 --> 00:08:12,379
this test. Under 200. Fuck yeah. Almost under

48
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,629
200. Look, I'm as good as if you connected to

49
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,709
like a server in Asia, right? That's pretty fast.

50
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:27,829
I'm as fast as a packet of data going from my computer to Asia and back.

51
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:34,059
That's fucking so fast. 50 dollars came in

52
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,740
from Visual Warlock. Thanks for the 50 bucks.

53
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,899
And you say, sorry you got scammed. I have this on top of the two shirts I

54
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,179
bought. Speaking of t-shirts, they're available

55
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,740
right now if you do exclamation point shirts.

56
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,179
There are two... Well, that's not true. There's one new shirt,

57
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:58,330
and there's a returning shirt. Glueman's back. They're both 20 dollars.

58
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,090
If you want one, they're there. And they're going to be there forever.

59
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,779
I can do this again. Top 93 percentile. I can get under

60
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,659
200. But thank you so much Visual Warlock for the 50

61
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,830
fucking dollars. It's a huge amount of money. Thank you. Somebody's like,

62
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,330
somebody's having like a party downstairs. Do you hear that?

63
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,600
No, that one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. I gotta refresh.

64
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,360
There's like a party going on downstairs. What am I missing right now?

65
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:47,399
This is not going to save as my average, right? This is a fucking...

66
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,370
There is a rave going on downstairs. I'm almost curious as to go check and

67
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,220
see what it is. Okay, here we go. Under 200. I know I

68
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,320
can do it. It's a six out of five. What's what's

69
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,519
going on? No, don't save this score. Just refresh the page.

70
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:26,419
Ready? What if I caught that? Two... Same exact number.

71
00:10:26,419 --> 00:11:03,350
Do it again. I can get under 200. I know I can.

72
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:13,830
The first one was, I was literally the host of the server.

73
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:22,360
Keep it under fucking 200. Got it. 186 milliseconds.

74
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,110
Average rate. Let's see, what's that? Currently in the top 92 percentile for

75
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:36,200
the test. Okay, pretty cool. How about number

76
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,500
memory test? This one looks cool. So this one is...

77
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,340
The average person can remember seven numbers at once. What's the longest

78
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,139
number you can memorize? I feel like I had some decent

79
00:11:50,139 --> 00:12:02,519
practice with this one. Two. What was the number? The number was

80
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:17,500
two. 72. 72. Honda. Honda. Honda. Honda.

81
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:27,860
406. 1048. You're gonna have to start... Remember, I'm gonna have to start

82
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,600
thinking about phone numbers. Fuck off. Not you. No, no. I was

83
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,539
pointing at the car. 72. 228.

84
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:59,190
22. 228. 99. 52. 99. 502.

85
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,820
968. 5736. 968.

86
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,330
5736. 968. 968.

87
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:18,620
9736. 125. 0314. 125.

88
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,740
03414. 125. 03414. 125. 03414.

89
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,139
492. 8348. 87. 4928.

90
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,779
34. 887. 4928. 34887. 4928.

91
00:13:36,740 --> 00:14:04,200
4928. 88347. What about verbal memory?

92
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,519
Verbal memory test. You'll be shown words one at a time. If you've seen a word

93
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,639
during the test, click safe for work. If it's a new

94
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,960
word, click not safe for work. Wait, what's the actual thing?

95
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,460
You'll be shown words one at a time. If you've seen a word during the

96
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,269
test, you've seen it. Amilas. No, that's new. Mango.

97
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,230
These are all new. Garments. Mango. Seen it.

98
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:39,779
Heartland. New. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. That's new. That's new.

99
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,830
Convet and that's new. Seen it. No. Seen it.

100
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:53,139
No. Seen it. No. No. No. Seen it. No.

101
00:14:53,139 --> 00:15:00,019
No. Seen it. No. Seen it. No. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

102
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,639
Seen it. New. It's new. New. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

103
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:16,360
Seen it. Seen it. New. New. Seen it. New. Seen it.

104
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,960
Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. New. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

105
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:35,190
New. Seen that. Seen that one too. Stop. That's new. Seen that one.

106
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:49,620
Top 79%. Top 79%. No, this is not. I'm doing pretty good.

107
00:15:49,620 --> 00:16:04,740
Visual memory. You have to change how this one is.

108
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm being squished. That's all right though. Okay.

109
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,639
Memorize the squares. Every level a number of tiles will flash. Memorize

110
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,039
them and pick them again after the tiles reset.

111
00:16:16,039 --> 00:17:59,769
Okay. It's getting bigger. I'm gonna do all right on this one.

112
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:07,450
Sorry. Let's stop. Top 66%. His IQ is increasing. Somebody stop him.

113
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:15,609
You are never gonna stop me. Okay. What is about a little fun little

114
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:22,019
game so we can play? Let chat do it. What? How can I let chat do

115
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:41,339
that? Do a personality test? We don't. We did those before. Google

116
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,539
feud. Is that just a family feud that I can play?

117
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,599
I want to play family feud right now. Where can I get one?

118
00:18:48,599 --> 00:19:01,640
Where can I actually get a family feud? I'm like into that right now.

119
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:11,130
It's on SNES. No, this guy's gotta be like a new

120
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:26,779
family feud game, right? Is it on Steam? Is that for real? Family feud? I don't see

121
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,869
family feud on Steam. Do Google? We did Google

122
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,230
feud before. I kind of got most of it out of that.

123
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:45,049
Try to beat Christopher Robin baseball. I almost lost my fucking mind playing

124
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,660
that game. Kahoot? Don't I need to? No. Kahoot

125
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,589
was a mess. I can't play Kahoot. The last time I

126
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:56,309
played Kahoot it was an absolute disaster.

127
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:08,500
Online family feud. Oh like Jeopardy. I want to play Jeopardy.

128
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:16,410
All right, I got it. I got it. This is probably gonna be loud. I'm on like

129
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:26,700
MSN zone. Does this site even work? I don't think this site actually still

130
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:35,740
works. Oh boy, there are ads all over this.

131
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,420
Oh thank god you can't hear this. One, two, three,

132
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,740
four. There are four ads. There's two playing video ads

133
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,339
here and here. There's a banner here. This is unbelievable.

134
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:58,809
Here's the thing. I had adblock on and I had to turn it off to load the page.

135
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,960
Oh my fucking god. All right, here we go. Let's hope this is worth it.

136
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:13,529
Buy the full version. You can fuck right off. Where's my headphone?

137
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:29,799
There goes your like credit card. Um, just like to add for like chicken

138
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:39,750
nuggets and stuff on the bottom. I refuse to have that show up on

139
00:21:39,750 --> 00:22:03,880
the screen. Look at this bullshit. All right, family

140
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,480
feud. I feel like doing this right now. Let's do it.

141
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:21,779
Play it. Let's play the family feud. We surveyed 100 people.

142
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,099
Top seven answers are on the board. Here's the question.

143
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:31,509
Name something you'd find in a school lost and found box.

144
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:42,819
Uh, keys. Survey says. Nobody know kids have keys? Yes they do.

145
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:56,920
Uh, Game Boy. Survey says. What? Um, a coat.

146
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:10,069
A sweater. Coat. Jacket. How about, uh, why would you lose your socks?

147
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,900
All right, I'm gonna take off my shoes and my socks and then I'm gonna lose

148
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,359
and I'm gonna put my shoes back on. Why would that happen? Lunchbox.

149
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:28,809
Survey says. Glasses. Everybody loses their damn glasses.

150
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:37,369
Survey says. Yep. Jacket, glasses, lunchbox.

151
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:46,440
Backpack. Survey says. Strike three. Too bad. Fine. Let's take a look.

152
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,950
So what is it? Jacket. Can we see two, please?

153
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:59,450
Hat. Let's see number three. Gloves. Let's see number six.

154
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:06,809
A book. Seven, let's see it. Shoes. How does somebody lose their shoes?

155
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:16,250
You don't, how do you lose your shoes? Let's play some more Feud.

156
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,980
All right, give me something else. Brown suit. We surveyed 100 people.

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,210
The top six answers are on the board. Here's the question.

158
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,250
Name something people need good posture to do.

159
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:50,390
Office work. Fucking. Survey says. Paint? Painting? Survey says.

160
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,190
Streaming's not gonna be on here. This is probably, this website is

161
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,279

162
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:09,640

163
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,650

00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:25,940

You need to be able to walk, do like the Chad walk.

171
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:58,380
Why would you ever type walk confidently and play the piano? I mean

00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,759
you do, but you. Betcox. Sacrifices you make.

00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:51,050
What might a person make when first learning how to knit? It's a sweater.

253
00:35:51,130 --> 00:36:03,130
Absolutely. Grandma a blanket. That's a pretty good one I think.

254
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,860
Blanket sweater uh hat. Hat is pretty easy

255
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:17,510
correct answer I think. Blanket sweater hat.

256
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:23,780
Tie. Gloves. Gloves. That's a good one. Gloves or

257
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:33,940
mittens is better. Only three people said mittens.

258
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:46,710
Um blanket sweater hat mittens. Socks. Can you knit socks? That doesn't

259
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,079
work right? It doesn't. How do you knit slippers? Wouldn't

260
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,199
they just be like old fucking pizza? That'd be like

261
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,250
walking in a pizza. It'd be like like squishing around

262
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:05,139
moving around. Wait what is it? Uh what's number one? What is number one?

Um leg sleeves. A beanie. A beanie is hat. Uh bed.

267
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,539
Yeah I remember when grandma knitted me a whole bed.

268
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:10,980
It was really comfortable. A pillow. A doll.

269
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,179
That's not a bad one. Doll like a little action figure.

270
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:35,670
So what is it? Potholder. Grandma I'm gonna burn my fucking hands.

271
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:43,380
That is the most dangerous gift grandma could ever give you.

272
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,949
That's not very heat resistant. All right name a kind of hat that would be weird

273
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:56,679
to see a magician pull a bunny from. Um a construction hat.

274
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:03,829
Construction. Construction. Chef's hat. Yeah hard hat.

275
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:17,929
Chef's hat. Not from a chef's hat. What kind of hat?

276
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:39,880
Wizard's hat. A wizard. Wizard's hat. A cowboy hat. Okay cowboy hat.

277
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:59,940
Hard hat. Sombrero. Hard hat. Cowboy hat. Sombrero. What is number one?

278
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,260
What do you guys think? From a wig. That's not a hat.

279
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:12,920
Like a baseball bat. You'd be a such a shitty magician.

280
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:43,820
Baseball hat. Cowboy hat. Sombrero. Hard hat. Football helmet. That's not bad.

281
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,019
A fedora. No it's not gonna be fedora. Top hat is a magic. That's a

282
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:51,369
magician's hat already. Isn't a top hat what a magician pulls

283
00:40:51,369 --> 00:41:11,460
their rabbits out of? No it is a top hat. A beret. Still doing

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:21,989
better than average. No!

285
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:41,929
I'm not gonna tell you what movie that was.

286
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:45,530
I don't want you guys to know. We surveyed 100 people.

287
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,409
The top five answers are. What is it? Here's the question.

288
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:53,610
Where do many teenagers have their first kiss?

289
00:41:53,610 --> 00:42:01,659
In their car. In a car.

290
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:09,349
Yeah. In a car.

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:15,349

Like outside. Like at like at the park.

295
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,420
Where do many teenagers have their first kiss?

296
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,760
On their mouth. I mean you're being very literal about that. I don't think

297
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:53,210
that's what they're looking for. Under the bleachers. That's like a

298
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:05,829
meme right? That's like a teenager meme. I mean like

299
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:10,380
school. That's what like that's what I was going for.

00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,550
School dance. Yeah that's that's true.

Prom right? Cars. School dance. Movies. Park.

That party is a good one. At like a party.

303
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:33,500
Birthday party. No you don't get a kiss on your birthday party.

304
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:48,869
Beach. It's not a bedroom. One guy said something here.

305
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:57,659
Front door. At the front door you're gonna do that? You're gonna do that?

306
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:00,059
You're gonna you're gonna kiss? You're gonna get a kiss in front of

00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:06,090
dad? Don't think that's gonna happen.

308
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:10,409
We surveyed 100 people. The top three answers are on the board.

309
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:14,440
Only three. Here's the question. Name something you find out about a word

310
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,389
by looking it up in the dictionary. What the hell are you talking about?

311
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:24,460
Name something you find out about a word.

bullshit all over this. You know what I'm saying?

470
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:23,690
I want it to look like clean. Okay so far so good.

471
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:42,699
Let's make it a little bigger. So this is Lemonade Stand.

472
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:46,460
Somebody like wrapped in tin foil spider manning on my walls.

473
01:04:46,460 --> 01:05:11,179
Can you hear that? Oh what fucking time? What is it?

474
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:15,260
Okay that's strange. This is Lemonade. I think is it raining? Is it raining in

475
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:21,739
Las Vegas right now? I think it is. That's weird. All right

476
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:23,579
so uh you have to deal with the weather

477
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:26,619
which plays a big part when customers are deciding whether they want

478
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:30,659
to come. Customer satisfaction. As you sell your

479
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,380
lemonade people will decide how much they like or dislike it.

480
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:43,750
Let me get my fucking face out of the way. Sounds easy. Let's go.

481
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:50,300
We'll do seven days. Okay you have zero paper cups zero lemon zero zero

482
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:56,630
everything zero. I have 20 bucks. It is 80 degrees and it's hazy.

483
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:02,500
You have zero okay 25 cups. Let's do 50 cups.

484
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:08,230
Let's get some let's get 30 lemons. I don't want it too sweet though.

485
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,980
No not too sweet. Eight cups of sugar and 100. You don't want to I

486
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:18,579
don't want to water it down. Vice lemon flavor without without the

487
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:25,030
the sweetness. Okay got 14 bucks.

488
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:29,659
Now I'm going to be too watery. Price per cup

489
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:35,400
25 cents. Lemons per pitcher. Five lemons per pitcher because we want

490
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,840
it to be nice and sweet. Two sugars per pitcher. Ice per cup.

491
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:48,489
Three. 25 cents a cup. Not enough sugar. No that's too

492
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:54,489
sweet. You don't want it to be that sweet.

493
01:06:54,489 --> 01:07:06,090
All right let's go. This is me. Anybody buying

494
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:10,309
cups? It's 80 degrees outside. There we go.

495
01:07:10,389 --> 01:07:19,480
Did you like it? Oh you really liked it.

496
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,449
It's like monsters in this planet here. Yuck.

497
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:30,650
Yeah go back to Sesame Street buddy. Go get angry at Grover for the spaghetti

498
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:54,809
he fucked up. Get out of my game. Yuck yuck.

499
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:59,960
Everybody wants their lemonade. It's so sugary and sweet that's not

500
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:07,179
why would you want it like that? More ice yuck.

501
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:13,059
More ice yuck. This guy keeps going back

502
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:17,220
to my stand. If you don't like it don't come back.

503
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,539
All right what about the monster? What about the Sesame Street monster?

504
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:27,159
Liked it. More ice yuck. More ice everyone.

505
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:33,739
Ice more ice more ice yuck. More ice yuck.

506
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:40,920
Fuck you all. Oh you managed to sell 21 cups to 105 potential customers.

507
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,720
Considering the weather I'd say this is pitiful.

508
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,689
With two percent popularity because they didn't put another ice cube in my

509
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:57,210
remaining ice has melted. Well all right we're gonna get a bunch

510
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:01,260
more ice then. More ice. What do I have for sugar?

511
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:06,500
You have four cups of sugar. Let's do more sugar and I will cut

512
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,619
back on the lemons and let's get some more cups.

513
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:16,460
Price per cup 25 cents. Cut back on the lemons. Add

514
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:20,100
sugar because that's what people want and add ice.

515
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:39,500
Go. More ice. Why do you guys want so much ice?

516
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,369
Nobody likes that. When you go to like a restaurant and they just

517
01:09:43,369 --> 01:09:46,890
they give you like four tablespoons of Pepsi

518
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:53,260
and then two bricks of ice. Nobody wants that.

519
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:58,649
People are more sad. More ice okay. More ice more ice.

520
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:08,359
Mmm more ice. That was pitiful. Your remaining ice. Two of your lemons

521
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:17,100
have spoiled. Bugs are in the sugar. 77 degrees. All right I'll give you

522
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:24,359
fucking sugar. More ice. I need more lemons.

523
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:27,909
Okay I'm still up. I'm still up a dollar 13

524
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:39,220
since opening the business. Let's do seven to eight cubes per cup.

525
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:51,960
I think the the taste is there. The flavor is there.

526
01:10:51,960 --> 01:11:01,449
Look at all these customers. What's sold out?

527
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:22,600
I don't even fucking cups. All right price per. Let's go 30

528
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,359
30 cents this time. We're gonna do five lemons per pitcher.

529
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:33,560
Five sugars per pitcher and eight. No 10 ice cubes per cup. No

530
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:49,529
eight ice cubes per cup. It's 53 degrees outside.

531
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:56,899
Make it cheap. Cheap. Very cheap. 15 cents.

532
01:11:56,899 --> 01:12:11,479
I had to get rid of the inventory. 58 degrees.

533
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:15,000
So do people even buy lemonade when it's this chilly? Why? How would I make

534
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:27,029
them get it? Who's gonna buy it? There's just no

535
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:33,670
ice. They put like less ice in it. Okay I got plenty of lemons.

536
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:39,479
I'll get some more. More sugar and then just like a little bit of ice.

537
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:50,890
Back 25 cents. Let's get like six. Four. Five is fine and like

538
01:12:50,890 --> 01:13:05,500
four. Like three ice cubes. No two. Sugary. Really sugary and less ice.

539
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:12,579
Do more ice. Three? That's cold out.

540
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:18,859
Seven sugars. Seven sugar per pitcher. Three ice cubes. Four ice cubes.

541
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,180
How are we doing on lemons? Lemons are fine. 58 is not cold but it's not

542
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,420
lemonade hot. It's not it's lemon. It's not

543
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:51,210
lemon. Let's go. Is it too expensive? 50 degrees.

544
01:13:51,210 --> 01:14:06,920
You have no sugar. Do you do you want I need to put more sugar in?

545
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,079
This is a that's very very decent lemonade. You're telling me I had 10

546
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:22,380
sugar. Six lemons. Three ice per cup. 25 cents. That's worth it.

547
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:30,779
Four ice. More lemon. Less sugar. Seven lemon. Nine sugar.

548
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:57,539
Four ice. It's too expensive. It's too expensive.

549
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:10,149
That's the problem. It's not 25 cents is too much. It's gonna be like 18.

550
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:16,180
18 cents. Bring these down a little. Five cubes.

551
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:37,369
Go. See? That was just too expensive. What's that? I ran out of ice?

552
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:43,189
Zero percent customer satisfaction. It said that's pretty good.

553
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:47,510
End of season. Total income. Liquidated inventory.

554
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:52,250
Net profit. Five dollars and eighteen cents.

555
01:15:52,250 --> 01:16:02,760
We're in the green. Oh that was it. 14 days. Okay.

556
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:10,420
Let's get cups. 30 lemons. 20 cups of sugar.

557
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,149
A shitload of ice. We'll go on. We've got to make some money here.

558
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:23,899
15 cents. Five lemons. Six sugar. What is it? It's 81 degrees out.

559
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:29,189
We're gonna go with like seven or eight cubes. Seven cubes.

560
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:51,319
15 cents a cup. Sold it out. It's gone. I needed more.

561
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:59,670
How do you go from like 90 degrees to 54?

562
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:11,369
Keep the lemons I have. We're gonna make it more sugary.

563
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:37,270
Bring down the lemons. 18 cents. Bring the cubes down to two. Okay.

564
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:44,949
Pretty average. 91 percent customer satisfaction.

565
01:17:45,029 --> 01:17:54,380
78 degrees and it's raining. So it's still hot though. Bunch of sugar.

566
01:17:54,380 --> 01:18:04,340
Bunch of ice. More lemons. We did that the worst possible way.

567
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,939
All right. We're gonna do. So it's hotter. We're gonna do maybe five ice

568
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:12,979
cubes. Drop the sugar. Let's put the price

569
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:20,819
at 18 because it's hotter. And bring the lemons up. 50 cents.

570
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:27,590
50 cents. 50 cents. That's way too much ice.

571
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:54,140
For 78 degrees? It's too expensive. Pretty good. 36 to 103.

572
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,600
High customer satisfaction. Not. Here we go. This is where we're gonna make all

573
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,890
the money right now. 91 degrees. It's clear and sunny.

574
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:13,140
Buy a shitload of 30 lemons. 48 cups of sugar. 500 ice cubes.

575
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:27,909
More cups. More lemons. 30 cents. Six lemons per pitcher. Eight.

576
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:58,119
Made it all back. All you need is one day. Sold out the whole inventory.

577
01:19:58,119 --> 01:20:05,539
62 out of 98 customers. 90. We're doing it again. Here we go again. All right.

578
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:10,170
This is where we're gonna milk everybody. Completely, completely dry here.

579
01:20:10,170 --> 01:21:10,149
Here we go. 71 to 86. That's pretty good.

580
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:13,189
97 percent satisfaction. 23 percent popularity.

581
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:17,350
It's raining today. I have a lot of lemons. I'm not gonna buy. I'm gonna

582
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:21,939
buy one small thing of ice. I gotta get rid of these lemons. I

583
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:27,029
got plenty of cups. Price per cup because it's raining out. We're gonna go

584
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:31,579
drop this down 25. Get rid of these lemons. Eight.

585
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:36,710
Seven. Let's go with like maybe maybe like five

586
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:42,170
ice cubes. Four ice cubes. Five ice cubes maybe.

587
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:49,020
No, I need more ice cubes than that. Let's go with five.

588
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:58,489
Eight. Seven. 25 cents. It's hot out. Yeah but it's raining

589
01:21:58,489 --> 01:22:01,050
though. So you're getting cooled down by the water particles that are

590
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:15,140
hitting your head. Don't fuck with the recipe. I'm gonna

591
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,569
drop the price. I need more lemons though. They're

592
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:24,329
gonna spoil. Definitely not 10 ice cubes though.

593
01:22:24,329 --> 01:22:38,380
Eight. Then I'll buy it. Drop the price. 20 cents. 22 cents.

594
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:48,409
Fucking rainy. Sold it out though. Good. 34 bucks.

595
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:53,109
Still doing just fine. 71 degrees in rain.

596
01:22:53,109 --> 01:22:59,140
I got plenty of cups. I need a little bit more sugar.

597
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:04,470
I don't think I need any more lemons. Let's bring this shit down

598
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:09,210
though. So let's do like seven lemons. Six

599
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:17,800
sugar. Six ice cubes. 20 cents. 18 cents.

600
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:36,039
Whatever I know. Lemons. That's still pretty good.

601
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:43,449
68 degrees in rain. I have plenty of cups.

602
01:23:43,449 --> 01:23:48,659
I don't think anyone's gonna want to buy any of this shit today.

603
01:23:48,659 --> 01:24:01,500
Let's do, let's go for it. 68. Keep it at 20 cents. Six lemons

604
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,819
per pitcher. It's eight sugars. Five ice cubes.

605
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:13,829
They're not buying it. They're not buying it. They're not buying it.

606
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:25,590
Dry it. Liquidate. Quick. Liquidate. Make it free.

607
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:34,949
We need some more hot days. 72 degrees. I still have plenty of lemons.

608
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:53,060
Plenty of cups. I need to tweak this. It's still not that nice up to like

609
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:57,819
you drink lemonade. Six lemons per pitcher.

610
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:01,750
Let's go with, keep it at eight because I have

611
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:08,550
no, let me get another thing of sugar so I can do it.

612
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:17,479
That's six. 12. 18. That's fine. Let's go 20 cents. See if they buy it.

613
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:35,180
What do we got for ice? Increase that price a little. People are paying for it.

614
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:52,220
I sold it all out. Lemon sale. 83 degrees. Here we go.

615
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:57,989
Change the game category to lemonade stand. I guess I could.

616
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:01,289
So it's gonna be, it's overcast 83 degrees.

617
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:15,989
It's time to buy. 75 lemons. 48 cups of sugar. 1,000 ice cubes.

618
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:27,819
This is the one. 25 cents. 7 lemons. 10 sugars. 8 ice cubes.

619
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:46,380
30 cents. 28. 28 cents. Come on now. Come on. All right. All right. We've

620
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:52,659
got the late customers here. Good. Good. Beautiful. 83 degrees. A little

621
01:26:52,659 --> 01:26:58,729
cloudy. Let's get some more of that sugar.

622
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:05,289
No. Give me more ice cubes. Don't fuck with the recipe. It's still 83 degrees.

623
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:21,189
Keep it at 28 cents. It's all right. That's pretty good.

624
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:25,079
It was a little too sugary but it's okay. I made money.

625
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:31,289
That's pretty good. I sold 48 customers. Right now

626
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:43,500
we gotta slow it down. 360 ice rip. This is fun. It's so easy

627
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,699
just to play it. All right. 56 degrees. I'm gonna sneeze.

628
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:51,319
I'm gonna take the sneeze cam off. I can't. I couldn't.

629
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:54,020
My button's not configured to the right thing.

630
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:59,189
Let's get some more cups. Let's get some more sugar.

631
01:27:59,189 --> 01:28:12,420
Way more sugar than that. Let's go with 20 cents.

632
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:21,399
8 lemons. 8 sugar. 3. 4 ice. 3 ice per cup.

633
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:42,279
7 sugars. 7 lemons. 20 cents. 18 cents. Buy it. It's good.

634
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:51,939
That was all right. 60. Keep the same recipe.

635
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:57,659
30 lemons. I'm gonna cut the sugar a little.

636
01:28:57,659 --> 01:29:05,819
Let's go. 4 cubes. No. 5. No. 4 cubes. Cut the sugar just a little bit.

637
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:16,569
Add some extra lemon. 20 cents. 18 cents.

638
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:31,289
I got a liquid 8. It's the last day. Final day.

639
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:35,930
It's time to make money. Watch this one. 87 degrees outside. I got 21 lemons.

640
01:29:35,930 --> 01:30:21,380
We're gonna do. We're going all in. 20 ice?

641
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:35,220
I can do 10 pitchers. 10. 20. 30. That's. Just make it 100% ice.

642
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:41,510
No. No. I got. That's a good strategy right here. 45 cents.

643
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:54,060
10 lemons. 10. 12 sugars. 10 ice per cup.

644
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:58,220
33 cents. 35 cents. 35 cents. 30. I was wrong.

645
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:21,029
30 cents. 30 cents. I had to go all in. It was just like at the New York

646
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:24,460
Stock Exchange. Sell it. Sell it. No. Sell it for less.

647
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:27,180
Sell it for a little less than him. Less than that. Please.

648
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:35,289
Somebody please buy it. 20 bucks. Profit. Nice. That's cool.

649
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:40,579
New York fucking stock exchange. I just undercut myself. That's the difference.

650
01:31:40,579 --> 01:32:12,250
20 dollars in a month. Look. All we need. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.

651
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:17,479
We just need one person to buy one glass of lemonade

652
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:35,750
for like 30 dollars. Um. So let's do like

653
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:40,890
5,000 cents. And there are going to be 40 lemons.

654
01:32:40,890 --> 01:33:09,159
50 sugars. And like 30 ice cubes. Somebody bought it. How did I sell out

655
01:33:09,159 --> 01:33:18,409
if nobody bought me a thing? Well anyways that was fun. The ice

656
01:33:18,409 --> 01:33:24,250
melted. Oh. That was cool. Uh. So. Uh. Oh it's under the

657
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:31,659
ice. Under the stream voice. No. Uh. But maybe. Depends. I think.

658
01:33:31,659 --> 01:33:35,930
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. He's gonna. Here he goes.

659
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:44,420

667
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:12,939

668
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:16,460
i'm gonna start i'm gonna start ace attorney tomorrow i'm gonna get it on ipad i'm gonna

669
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:25,510
plug it in get everything done um also in the meantime go to the discord and there is that

670
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:28,310
recommendation channel by the way you're gonna follow the rules there are rules in that

671
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:32,470
channel you don't just go over there and just like spam shit if you're is there if there are

672
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:40,010
flash games and i mean like online fun interesting like mcdonald's games that we didn't have i've

673
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:45,420
never done right i want to do them because it's fun just to kind of hang out and chill

674
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:52,060
and just relax and play some fun little games so we'll do that after i probably finish

675
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:56,779
ace attorney so we're gonna start ace attorney tomorrow and then i won't be streaming after

676
01:35:56,779 --> 01:36:03,260
tomorrow i will be taking a break for a day or two so after tomorrow's ace attorney stream

677
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:08,699
we will pick back up on wednesday and depending on where i am with ace attorney we'll see how

678
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:18,710
it goes i think that's a pretty good plan how many ace attorneys will i play that i mean i

679
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:23,430
don't i can't really i don't know there's i don't really have a gauge to tell you that

680
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:26,869
right now because if i have fun playing the first one and i actually get through the first

681
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:31,590
one i'm like this is great i can't wait to play the next one then we'll just do them in succession

682
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:35,909
at least for i mean i'm not going to do ace attorney ace attorney ace attorney ace attorney

683
01:36:35,909 --> 01:36:40,470
ace we'll break them up so they're not you know awful to do that that many times in a

684
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:48,069
row i have never played an ace attorney game i don't know what they are the only thing i

685
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:52,550
know is that meme where you point your finger and you scream objection right so i don't know

686
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:58,890
and i don't i don't even know what that means that long as hell how long is the first

687
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:16,649
one is the first one more than like eight to 12 hours 10 hours 17 hours they're too long to

688
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:29,739
beat in a day about 17 hours how long to beat says 17 well whatever i mean well that was the

689
01:37:29,739 --> 01:37:37,850
that was an incredibly highly requested thing so i'm going to try it if look if after like

690
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,569
a few hours it's like all right this was fun but i don't know if i'm going to stream it

691
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,739
who knows i might i might get really into it and we might have a great time

692
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:53,859
so look i'm not going to tell you we're going to do a full completion run of all the ace

693
01:37:53,859 --> 01:37:59,539
attorney games but i've blindly never played them before so might as well start the first

694
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:06,310
one on stream and see how it goes your eyes are really popping like out of my head

695
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:23,350
what do you mean should i that is it a problem that sounds like a problem very

696
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:30,380
bright oh i don't think i did anything with my settings on my camera uh but yeah we'll call

697
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:33,579
tonight that's that should be it for tonight because i really wanted just to kind of close

698
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:37,979
the book we'll do three we'll go three days in a row so i really want to close the book on the

699
01:38:37,979 --> 01:38:43,659
dreamcast stuff which is now done Shenmue still exists that's going to have to be dedicated to

700
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:50,520
a completely different day seaman and space channel the first one are not going to be

701
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,760
part of like the dreamcast streams i'll do them completely separately we'll just do them

702
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,840
on a random day where they get in so and don't think that this is me just spouting off my

703
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:06,279
typical bullshit uh i loved space channel so i'm absolutely going to go back we're going to play

704
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:12,680
the first one absolutely so uh i will see you guys tomorrow we'll start ace attorney

705
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:20,810
jet set radio abandoned and forgotten by big boomer media i'm going to go shave i'm going

706
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:26,039
to go get some mcdonald's so literally the literally the one guy that said mcdonald's is

707
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:29,800
the end is the reason why the stream's turning off just want to make sure everyone's well aware

708
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:37,560
of that uh end of the stream yeah we're going to go tomorrow ace attorney i'll see you guys there

710
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:53,100
get this thing off my face but let's do the uh the bits let's check it from earlier

711
01:39:56,090 --> 01:40:00,010
a little bit shorter tonight but i kind of had the inkling that i was going to go three

712
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:07,020
days in a row anyway so a little bit shorter stream in the middle here and 50 dollars just

713
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:18,699
kind of blasted it right now tyler mike just gave 50 bucks 5000 bits 5000 glad to hear you're

714
01:40:18,699 --> 01:40:23,100
playing the ace attorney trilogy i finished it recently and i really enjoyed it i think you

715
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,859
will especially like it if you get into doing the voice uh the voice is like you did in

716
01:40:26,859 --> 01:40:30,859
sorcery also just want to remind you that it's been over two months since your last

717
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:34,619
stream with vinnie uh that didn't go too well you guys said you try again so just

718
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:42,489
thought it would remind you germa hart and vineheart yeah i mean we it's just kind of

719
01:40:42,489 --> 01:40:48,300
whenever we kind of both feel like it right i i we didn't put like a set in stone hey let's

720
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:53,529
do something else it just kind of happens i still have to do the gamer challenge with joel

721
01:40:54,489 --> 01:40:57,689
joel and i are going to do a stream at the same time where we do a gamer challenge and

722
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:04,409
the first person to complete the challenge uh wins the trophy we're going to get a custom

723
01:41:04,409 --> 01:41:08,409
made trophy built i'm making this up now but now it has to happen because i just said it on live

724
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:14,949
and we're not going to do getting over it because he already has practice in that game

725
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:20,489
i played that game a year and a half ago he has the edge there i'm not going to give him the

726
01:41:20,489 --> 01:41:25,369
house edge we have to have a game that when neither one of us has played both completely

727
01:41:25,369 --> 01:41:36,279
blind going into it that's a highly skilled game and that this trophy is going to be worth

728
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:45,000
2500 is going to be is going to be made of solid gold um that's a lie too but i'm going to say

729
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,619
that that's not going to happen because i'm not going to do we're not doing that but yeah we'll

730
01:41:51,619 --> 01:41:56,979
figure that out all in due time but let's go back to the beginning uh no 2500 gold statue

731
01:41:56,979 --> 01:41:59,939
just want to be sure you know i don't want to put any pressure on and you know people that

732
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:03,539
maybe think well holy shit we're going to do 2500 why'd you say that jeremy

01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:17,960
it makes everyone happy because nobody expects it really though do what you feel like expect

764
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:23,720
except not playing god hand uh do play god hand even if you don't like it feel like it

765
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:29,159
i'm gonna get more bits now to fund the god hand stream how much is it 20 bucks oh whatever i'll

766
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:34,760
let my subscription finance it now if you're wondering what what are you uh what he's referring

767
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:43,720
to so earlier in the stream i had a little heart to heart with chat about how um i had

768
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:48,020
shown up you know getting rid of the schedule right but something that i did since moving to

769
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:53,619
vegas and i think it's helped a lot i also think what will help a lot uh is not necessarily

770
01:47:53,619 --> 01:48:02,229
help but the sus command shows a timer and the timer goes to zero and a lot of times

771
01:48:02,869 --> 01:48:08,310
the stream doesn't start when that timer reaches zero and even though i have oh three-ish p.m

772
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:13,189
like no schedule like afternoons i'll let you know kind of the days it's probably time

773
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:18,890
to get rid of the countdown timer for sus because if i don't have a schedule and i'm

774
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:25,060
starting somewhere in the afternoons between like 2 30 and like 4 30 p.m pacific having a

775
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:35,460
timer countdown is just very it's it's it's it's irrelevant so maybe the timer could stay

776
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:39,939
but instead of it being maybe instead of a no but then i don't know if it would work

777
01:48:39,939 --> 01:48:46,420
like that maybe it could be set where it's like you sense a stream starting today between

778
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:53,420
like two and four p.m pacific right because i feel like i'm uh burning a lot of people

779
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:56,779
when it comes to stuff like that because you know oh hey tomorrow around like three o'clock i'll

780
01:48:56,779 --> 01:49:01,100
be starting and then you know oh he's starting tomorrow at three the sus command it's like

781
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:05,819
counting down to three p.m three zero zero pacific and the stream doesn't start it's like

782
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:10,779
well i'm here where is he oh yeah i was eating i'll be you know i'll be there in

783
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:14,300
like 20 minutes oh the countdown went to zero you're supposed to lie you know what i mean

784
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:20,779
you're supposed to be live right now i think 99 percent of people are joking yeah but even

785
01:49:20,779 --> 01:49:27,819
still i i personally don't want to continuously have people think there's a stream starting at

786
01:49:27,819 --> 01:49:39,859
an exact moment and then you kind of just sit in here that one guy got to him no i've gotten

787
01:49:39,859 --> 01:49:46,500
complaints from a lot of people before about oh i wish he would just go back to the schedule

788
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:51,380
because he's just kind of randomly streaming and he's late all the time and i get it i

789
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:58,699
trust me i understand uh i i am very sorry that streams just sporadically happen sometimes

790
01:49:58,699 --> 01:50:04,010
during the afternoons but that was kind of the intention of getting rid of the schedule

791
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:11,619
moving to vegas and we're all well aware of this that since moving to vegas there's been

792
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:27,720
more and longer streams streams should start around 3 p.m yeah that's that that's a decent

793
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:31,640
way to or like give like a it's like a window like stream starting like between like

794
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:38,329
three and four p.m pacific right because then at least it's not a countdown that people are

795
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:42,649
going to be like oh fuck or have the countdown be somewhere in the middle and have it say

796
01:50:42,649 --> 01:50:50,550
like starting around this time or just give like the day time zones are a tricky too i

797
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:58,220
just i just it's become very clear that i'm not adhering to the sus countdown it's been

798
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:07,449
like that for months and your time is valuable because you're here watching my stream so i

799
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:14,970
respect your time and i'm i'm kind of i don't want to disrespect it by just kind of haphazardly

800
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:19,289
showing up when i feel like it and there's a countdown that just went to zero i hope you

801
01:51:19,289 --> 01:51:29,220
understand just show up on time but there is no time because i threw the schedule out the

802
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:35,420
window you see it used to be you know tuesday thursday friday 7 p.m eastern that's when i

803
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:40,680
was i had to be here now it's just i i might stream tomorrow oh well maybe we'll do another

804
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:45,720
one on monday or i'll still i'll do that on tuesday there's no set schedule or dates or

805
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:58,149
anything anymore and i'm not i don't want to work on a schedule carve the schedule into

806
01:51:58,149 --> 01:52:09,579
your chest why not because i had a schedule for two just about two years and when i have a

807
01:52:09,579 --> 01:52:15,750
schedule of three days a week that is the only time that i allow myself to turn on the stream

808
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:22,760
because tuesday thursday friday that's it that's when the stream turns on and that's it and i

809
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:29,750
take three days off every week four days off every week and it would be i would essentially

810
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:35,109
find myself sitting there you know friday afternoon going oh okay what are we doing

811
01:52:35,109 --> 01:52:39,850
today rather than oh i can let me get this going and i'll do it on saturday just

812
01:52:40,329 --> 01:52:44,090
i don't have to do it on friday i can get something ready and then do it on saturday

813
01:52:44,729 --> 01:53:01,829
it's been a lot better have you really tried to be on time yeah all the time but with the

814
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:08,180
nature of like what the nature of what we do on this stream it's hard to like be exact

815
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:15,689
you know there's weird technical we play like consoles from fucking 25 years ago

816
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:20,619
sometimes like i'm playing up to today i'm playing a ported game that the graphics

817
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:25,050
don't even work and need like troubleshooting and i gotta figure that out sometimes it takes

818
01:53:25,369 --> 01:53:30,250
it's not as simple as hey the stream is on because this is what i'm guaranteed is exactly

819
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:44,970
what's happening every day but i know a lot of people say i want you to be on a schedule

820
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:55,289
but i don't so at the end of the day i have to do what i know is possible for me to have

821
01:53:55,289 --> 01:54:15,779
the best possible streams that i can and that's just all there is to it so i want to

822
01:54:15,859 --> 01:54:22,890
begin the process of starting to detach from hard days and hard times

823
01:54:26,069 --> 01:54:29,989
because i've in two and three plus a year streaming i've not adhered to them

824
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:35,449
because that's not the way my brain has ever been able to work or function properly

825
01:54:51,350 --> 01:55:03,560
streamers afraid of commitment afraid of the nice girl i like no schedule because i like

826
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:13,829
chaos no no but no schedule and no hard there's a lot of people to do it and they and they're

827
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:19,319
doing just fine i know a lot of people at least a handful of people offhand that don't have any

828
01:55:19,319 --> 01:55:38,460
schedule or any time frame and they it's it's it's going very well disciplined emotional

829
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:49,029
i like uh i just sort of tune into the stream when i'm bored so no schedule suits me really

830
01:55:49,029 --> 01:55:52,710
well if it means more streams and longer streams then that means i get to watch more

831
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:59,130
yeah i mean there's two ways to look at it there's either go back to the schedule and

832
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:05,050
actually hard time yourself and stream three days a week or dump the schedule like i have

833
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:12,100
and i mean i streamed simpsons hit and run for 12 hours you know why i did that because i

834
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:18,329
knew that the next day i probably wasn't going to do anything and that i could take a break

835
01:56:18,329 --> 01:56:23,130
the day the day later if that was on a thursday and i am scheduled for friday it's

836
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:28,039
like oh well like i don't want to stream that long on thursday because it's just a lot of

837
01:56:28,039 --> 01:56:41,189
moving parts there and it works it does it works better for a lot of people some people the

838
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:51,270
schedule makes them it fixes all their issues it lets them be incredibly strict with themselves

839
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:57,609
and on time and ready but i'm never fucking ready every day it doesn't matter what it is

840
01:56:58,569 --> 01:57:02,569
and some stuff that we try to do here takes extra time or takes extra moments

841
01:57:03,449 --> 01:57:09,050
and i would rather be able to know and go when i can rather than say i have to go at a certain

842
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:26,250
time people work in different ways and people can create things in different ways there's no

843
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:31,850
real correct answer it's just how well you handle however you're doing things you're doing

844
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:52,840
germa you're actually thinking of the best choice for fixing this problem that you blew

845
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:59,930
out of proportion in your head just make the sus timer show a time range i don't think i blew

846
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:06,649
it out of proportion considering that one of the uh one of the biggest channel memes on this channel

847
01:58:06,649 --> 01:58:14,460
is how i'm never on time and it's a joke but it's it's there you know there's a reason

848
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:36,630
why that joke exists you admitted it was a joke no yeah but i mean like but do i necessarily

849
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:42,310
want one of like the number one things people say as a joke on the channel is that i'm not on

850
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:47,909
time and i'm late every day i mean it's funny but at the end when you think when you put the

851
01:58:47,909 --> 01:59:06,229
microscope on it's like well why the fuck is he late every day but i figured i'd bring it

852
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:16,199
up talk about it because then uh the more accurate it can be it'll be better for everybody

853
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:33,449
so we also call you short and stupid well all right come on let me let's go over this ready

854
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:43,560
short stupid and late you know when sometimes when you look over here and you see those things

855
01:59:44,119 --> 01:59:50,550
all the time it's like okay all right do any anything else that people have to say

856
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:09,159
you know what i'm saying but all uh all quips aside i uh i i do i think it's the right call

857
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:17,850
so sus ain't going away let's let's move on sus is not going away it's changing to a small

858
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:23,739
time frame the day will still be there the time frame will still be there just no countdown

859
02:00:24,699 --> 02:00:43,289
i've said my piece well let's move on where are we hey divas thanks for the two bucks

860
02:00:43,289 --> 02:00:52,329
divas uh demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar i may have told everyone to make this

861
02:00:52,329 --> 02:01:01,289

to supplement doctor income thank you though please some love for the eu the move hurt us

871
02:02:56,020 --> 02:03:05,100
badly and the schedule really helped us i i hate to say this but that's that statement

872
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:14,869
is incorrect the streams have pulled back at least one full hour since i moved to vegas

873
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:21,659
i don't know where you're getting that statement from i used to start streaming

874
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:30,600
at seven or eight p.m eastern every time i start at like six p.m eastern i don't i don't

875
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:41,500
know what you mean what does it mean i've pulled the i pulled the stream back an hour

876
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:57,670
like telling me that i'm used to start earlier is just that's not true i started

877
02:03:57,670 --> 02:04:02,869
like three p.m i used to start at seven p.m at least seven to eight p.m eastern every time

878
02:04:19,159 --> 02:04:25,500
it's hard it's hard to respond to somebody asking a question like that you know what i

879
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:38,119
mean it's hard because i i've it's we've gone back a full hour and i've already talked about

880
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:42,840
how i'm i can't i'm not going to start a stream at like 10 a.m it's just not going to

881
02:04:42,840 --> 02:05:03,670
happen i live in a certain time zone that's very very far away from a significant portion of

882
02:05:03,670 --> 02:05:15,270
european people that that's just that's just the way it is i i can't like turn my stream

883
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:20,539
on at like nine or ten a.m i can't i'm not going to do that it's not going to happen

884
02:05:31,369 --> 02:05:41,939
just move here but i'm i'm sorry if you can't watch the streams live or if they go

885
02:05:41,939 --> 02:05:53,539
too late but i already because remember i'm starting the stream in the middle of the afternoon

886
02:05:53,539 --> 02:05:58,739
which is something that i never did before because i moved across the country america's

887
02:05:58,739 --> 02:06:05,029
huge there's there are four time zones in the united states and i went across all of them

888
02:06:05,029 --> 02:06:23,829
to the last one britain is more important than vegas well i've told you like the data

889
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:30,939
on my analytics i think almost i think 80 something percent of every viewer is from

890
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:40,569
north america so think about if i were to start a stream at like 8 a.m a more than a

891
02:06:40,569 --> 02:07:04,630
majority of every viewer would probably not be here 20 percent of me does not reside in

892
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:25,750
north america it can't be late if you never turn on the stream it's the same boomer antics

893
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:36,489
as always but it's i to put a cap on this and to move on from it there's nothing i can do

894
02:07:38,229 --> 02:07:42,789
it's like if if if there's a show that is airing right just think of it like television

895
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:47,989
if they like let's say game of thrones for instance is airs at like nine p.m

896
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:57,939
it airs nine p.m eastern time like game of thrones the show producers don't sit in a room

897
02:07:57,939 --> 02:08:00,739
and go no no we got to pull we got to air it at like edit like 11 a.m

898
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:08,409
no because it's it's like it's a video it's it's not live a live like the reference like nfl

899
02:08:08,409 --> 02:08:15,380
right if there was a football game that played at 7 p.m eastern time they're not going to

900
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:21,210
like pull the super ball back eight hours because they want to make sure that people

901
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:29,939
nine time zones forward you know what i'm saying it's a it's a hard that's very

902
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:47,420
difficult thing to balance stop comparing your stream to the super ball no i'm just talking about

of katamari and the way that it's a piece of art that exemplifies what makes a video game

926
02:12:52,710 --> 02:13:05,060
such a great medium yeah i would agree katamari is sort of otherworldly in its own genre so you

02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:10,630
could kind of say that about space channel although there was i wouldn't call it genre

928
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:18,380
defining but it was on the dreamcast so i might have to but i do agree it was a great work

doing that i feel like that's when you go through like the you're going down the path of

1045
02:29:58,329 --> 02:30:03,020
i have to do this i have to do this i have to do this no but i that that that can wait i have to

1046
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:07,579
have to do this this has to happen this exact specific way once you start to do that you start

1047
02:30:07,579 --> 02:30:15,270
to kind of lose in my opinion at least in like a creative sense you lose what you started

1048
02:30:15,270 --> 02:30:26,899
it for in the first place wanting to do something and having having to do something

1049
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:43,850
they're very very different and i never want these streams or me anything that i do online

1050
02:30:44,489 --> 02:30:49,930
to start to bleed into the have to category because i've seen a lot of creators over the years

1051
02:30:50,489 --> 02:30:57,540
start to get into the have to categories and that's the place i don't want to be

1052
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:16,489
and even if it is in a detriment to my business i don't i that's the way it is

1053
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:39,299
jimmer who is your crush her name is kim let me see come on come on yeah come on they give

1054
02:31:39,299 --> 02:31:47,659
me the points those were points i deserve them i deserve those points and i'll take them and i will

1055
02:31:47,659 --> 02:31:55,739
stand at the back of the court and i will throw a shot put the basketball swish but thank you

1056
02:31:56,379 --> 02:32:04,629
all of you that yes i do things that a lot of other people don't do i'm all over the place

1057
02:32:04,629 --> 02:32:11,770
i'm scatterbrained some of the streams are all fucked up but that's the way that it is

1058
02:32:13,450 --> 02:32:18,489
i i'm not i'm not gonna be able to change some of the deep rooted personality traits that

1059
02:32:18,489 --> 02:32:31,700
i have and i don't want to don't let the jokes get to you no no no no no no i'm not talking

1060
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:37,590
about jokes i'm talking about actual real concerns that people have and that i have too

1061
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:43,110
you know you don't just to harp back on you don't think i think about all the time

1062
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:48,040
like you know see me look at the clock like oh fuck it's like it's it's it's 11 o'clock

1063
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:53,420
at night right now it's like this late for like it's like fucking 5 a.m for 6 a.m for

1064
02:32:53,420 --> 02:33:00,309
some people you don't think i think about oh what that that stream i want to do this stream is

1065
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:05,270
that gonna be funny people gonna think that's cool and then oh they did all right awesome all

1066
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:08,709
right that was worth it oh how people can react to that i think about all the time

1067
02:33:10,229 --> 02:33:14,229
i want everyone to enjoy as much as they can and i want the stream to be as fun as possible

1068
02:33:19,059 --> 02:33:26,500
it's upstairs all the time this guy is well you're very self i'm not i'm not self-conscious

1069
02:33:28,059 --> 02:33:32,459
self-conscious is not the word i've like shown you guys might like boogers on stream

1070
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:40,680
i was like naked on stream one time i don't give a shit about any of that i just haven't concerned

1071
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:48,180
with because the channel has grown so much that i want to make sure that we can stay true to

1072
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:52,739
what we're doing here i can stay true to why i started i can have the same fun that i had

1073
02:33:52,739 --> 02:34:11,290
two three four or five years ago i don't somebody just mentioned i don't know if it's

1074
02:34:12,489 --> 02:34:20,860
self-conscious thing as much as it's a like a like somebody said personal integrity for me

1075
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:28,549
like jet for like for me i'm not standing on a soapbox and telling you guys that i'm

1076
02:34:28,549 --> 02:34:33,670
let me tell you this about me and why i'm so much better it just internally if i don't do that

1077
02:34:35,049 --> 02:34:36,889
then i lose why i did it in the first place

1078
02:34:51,639 --> 02:34:58,600
maybe you should stand on the soapbox it'll help us find you that was that was almost me
