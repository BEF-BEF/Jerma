1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:07,269
Oh, where does he live again? God damn it. I just never remember where he lives.

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:12,630
I think it's this one up here. Gotta pick up my colleague. There he is.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,070
Hey, Pinkerton!

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,949
Come on, get in!

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,059
I'm getting in, I'm getting in. You gotta pull up to the sidewalk.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,820
Listen, Moby, Moby, we're gonna be late to work. If you just shut up for a minute,

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,980
I gotta talk to you about something really important.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,890
All right, what is it about those reports again? I told you I had the reports in.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,050
Is it this right? Is it straight or right?

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,090
It's no, you go straight.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,090
Okay, straight. You live in such a weird area, I just never know where to actually go. Straight still?

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,890
Yes, keep going straight.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,009
Am I going straight?

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,929
Yes, you're going straight.

15
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:55,399
I swear we've hit every single red light in Liberty City.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,979
Just go. No one will notice. There's no cops around. Just go.

17
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,500
Do you really think we can get out of here?

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Just make a quick right. Just go. Burn out. You don't buy a car. It's expensive.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
And then you sassy Susan this stuff.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,420
Okay, I got through the red light. What is with you and sassy Susan, by the way?

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't know. Get out the car. I have a knife.

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,310
Look at my face close up.

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,230
Get like a rifle and zoom onto this face.

24
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,299
What are you doing?

25
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:30,969
My face hurts.

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:50,870
How do you do that? How do you do that? Everything about this is so broken.

27
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,189
Can you believe that there's a road swamp? It's unbelievable. I've got water all over me.

28
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,550
I haven't seen a road swamp this bad since Brazil.

29
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,430
I haven't seen a road swamp that bad in a long time, but anyways.

30
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,379
Yeah, hello, Geico. Yes, I need one of those automatic repairs of my car.

31
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,500
Yeah, you're honestly using Geico.

32
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,259
I'm on the phone. Be quiet. I need to get one of those automatic repairs.

33
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm a million dollar businessman. I do. Thank you.

34
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:37,110
Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Yes. Sure. Yes.

35
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,590
I don't know. I'm not sure. Yes. I'm pretty positive, but it's not. Yes.

36
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:47,780
To be honest with you, I think it could be. Yes. Maybe a different thing. Maybe something else.

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:56,280
Yes. Yeah, I guess you could be right. Yes. Could you be wrong? Yes. No. Yes.

38
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,219
Nick, stop running so fast.

39
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,610
My legs. Look at this cute little hippo.

40
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,500
Where's the hippo? I don't even see a hippo.

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,300
To the right.

42
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:19,240
What? Oh my goodness. This little hippo is so beautiful. I wish I had one just like it.

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,540
All right. Come on. Don't throw the fingers at me like that. Like you do that sometimes.

44
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
All right. We need to cross the street. Be careful.

45
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,339
Be careful. There could be a car coming. Look both ways. Left and right. Good job.

46
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:40,149
Hold on. It's completely. It was never even

47
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,629
opened and never used and it's already ruined.

48
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:55,420
This guy's like clone just came over here. Can I make these two fat guys fight each other?

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,819
Oh my God. I think I can. Come on. Hey, you fat guy. Fight this fat guy.

50
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:11,620
Oh no. I have like the fat shit Mario brothers like attacking me. Here we go. Come on. Punch

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,970
him. There it is. Okay. Here we go. Place your bets, everybody. All right. I got the fat guy in

52
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:26,089
the blue jacket. Oh, salty bets.com. Come on. Do you actually know what that is? Come on,

53
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,850
dude. Will you please? I got a lot of money on you. Wow. You are terrible. There you go.

54
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:39,540
Give him a left hook. Place your bets. Wow. You suck, dude. Stop like throwing the long

55
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:48,819
haymaker. That's like your downfall. No, I lost. Every day we do the same trip to work and you

56
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,100
always tell me I'm the fun guy. I'm the fun guy. It's not about being the fun guy. It's about being

57
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,180
the hard worker like me that gets a job done. I mean, I can't believe this. That you would be

58
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,620
stupid about everything. And you know, every time you're in the office, you always get too much

59
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,379
water. You take too many breaks. You're going to make my blood pressure go through the roof.

60
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:10,819
What do you think about that? Well, you know, as a salesman, it's not entirely about getting work

61
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,339
done. It's the people interaction, the people you're selling. You got to be the fun guy.

62
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:25,939
Uh, no, nothing about this should be, should be a thing. No, this is, I'm just going to move on.

63
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:35,800
Make the right turn. No, I know a better way to go. We have to go right anyway, eventually.

64
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,920
No, listen, I know where I'm going. I've worked in this building for more than 30 years. What are

65
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:48,199
you a second year? Yeah, but I've been earning more than you weekly, monthly and yearly. This

66
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:57,079
right, you go down the street and then it's going to be on our left. We're going to get a ticket.

67
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,439
I don't care. I'm so sorry. It's a green light. No, it's yellow. It's yellow and that turns red,

68
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,319
which means you cannot go any further. We had a chance to go. You want me to go? Yeah, go.

69
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,000
You want me to go through this red light? No, no, no, no, no. You want me to go?

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,439
Is that what you wanted? Is this what you wanted? You wanted me to go?

71
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,009
Okay, we're at work. Okay, we're at work. Thank you. Yeah, that was a good trip.
