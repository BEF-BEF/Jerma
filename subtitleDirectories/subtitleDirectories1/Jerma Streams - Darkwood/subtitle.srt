1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:16,280
Hey. Sorry. Hi guys. What a great way to start. Make a lot of fucking gross noises. But hello.

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,089
Sorry, I was doing something that required my attention, but still started on time with that

3
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,730
2 p.m. Right before 2 1 58 exactly. I think it was. Don't have to stream for 24 hours,

4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:43,659
because as you see, if you type in the new the new emote, I told you that when the stream started

5
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:49,979
today, if there wasn't that emote there, that I would have to do a 24 hour stream. But thankfully,

6
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,820
look at that. It's there. By the way, I don't know what to title this stream,

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,520
because what the hell else do you title this? We're gonna play Darkwood. It's October. There's

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,959
been a lot of requests to play this game. I don't know why. And this is scary. Is it weird? Is it

9
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:15,620
intense? I don't know. I have no idea. But what am I right? Just is Darkwood. Should I just

10
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:34,500
title the game the name MonkaS? No, that's so it's too easy. Hold on. Yeah, if you have any

11
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,290
horror game suggestions that I have not played, throw it in the recommended channel. I'll take

12
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:50,260
a look at them because it is October. So I mean, right. It's Darkwood. I was gonna write like into

13
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:57,719
the into the dark wood, but that's too easy to that's simple. Sometimes just has to be what

14
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:11,590
you're doing. Dead Rising. All right, let me make a tweet. I'll be back in like 40 minutes.

15
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:33,539
Just making a tweet. I see a lot of Yes, yes, this game is so good. Yes, this game is so good. Is

16
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:42,580
it really? Is it good? Am I okay? Am I gonna like this game? Or is this gonna be one of those

17
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,780
scenarios where I'm just like, I don't I don't fucking get it. I don't find that's just fucking

18
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,900
stupid. It's stupid. That fucking dumb game. I don't fucking like this. Find out. But yeah,

19
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:02,199
let's go. Enjoy the new emote. There's a couple of scenarios where you should be using it, by the

20
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:08,520
way. Really, I think only one or two scenarios where that emote makes any sense. One is,

21
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:17,610
if I taste or smell something gross on stream, or if you if you hear this sound,

22
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:27,530
this is pretty much the only reason why I would be on. You can't even hear this.

23
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:39,939
So if you hear a vacuum cleaner on stream, if it's in a game, what a perfect opportunity.

24
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,370
Or if I'm like, that's it. Don't use it anywhere else, or I'll get rid of it. All right, let's go.

25
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,569
Let's do Darkwood. Funny thing about this game, I actually downloaded this game a long time ago,

26
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:02,419
apparently, and have seven minutes of playtime in this game. I don't know how I don't know when

27
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:17,899
or why. Did I open it and go now? I mean, that's, that's as long as it is to do the

28
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:28,939
options in your video settings. Derma, don't do this. Turn on face cam. All right, if you're good.

29
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:43,939
Not a blind stream. Well, the menu is maybe not blind. Turn on cam. If you're good. All right,

30
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,100
play. What if I imagine I hit play, and I didn't know that you guys could see that there was a

31
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,860
save game that has like seven hours of playtime, and I've just been fucking lying that I never

32
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:02,740
played it. Thank God. That was close. There's like four different save slots, all with like

33
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,180
20 hours of game time. Face cam. You'll get if you go if you'll get a face cam if you're good.

34
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,660
Difficulty normal. The forgiving mode. When dying, you drop part of your equipment. No.

35
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,180
The unforgiving mode. You have a limited number of lives. After that, it's game over. No.

36
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:30,040
The ultimate thrill. Death is permanent. No. Oh, there's no easy. Indiegogo content. This option

37
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:38,579
enables additional cool but immersion breaking content. I don't want that. Does that mean like

38
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,180
Thomas the Tank Engine is going to be in the game and like draw like a like a mod or something? I

39
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:54,680
don't want that. Skip the prologue. No, don't skip the prologue. Normal difficulty. I don't want to

40
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,230
break my immersion. I'm going to get super locked into this. All right, you ready? You'll get this

41
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:20,569
if you're good. Why is it glitching out? All right, you'll get this if you're good. Is he wearing

42
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,660
Aquaman? Yep. All right, I gotta put I'm not putting both headphones in. You're playing a

43
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,459
challenging and unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient

44
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:38,839
and focus. Okay, so backseating is allowed in this stream. Those of you that backseating is okay.

45
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm going to give you a phrase. If I use this phrase, that means tell me the answer. Okay,

46
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm going to look into the chat and I'm going to say please tell me the answer.

47
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,129
And that's all that needs to happen. Backseating is completely allowed. Like,

48
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,290
I encourage it actually. You're not going to read a challenging unforgiving game like that.

49
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,410
And then I don't know. I'm going to focus but I want the answers. I'm going to get them.

50
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,689
I don't even know what's on this coffee cup. Prologue. Quiet.

51
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,540
You've been good enough. You'll get the face cam for five minutes then it's going off.

52
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:30,300
I see hatred and fear in their eyes. As if I was responsible for spreading for the spreading

53
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,269
disease. Okay, there's an illness. There's a disease. There's a disease. As if I were

54
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:49,509
the source of all the misery plaguing this land. All right. I have nowhere to hide from them,

55
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,069
nowhere to run. The woods have closed us off from the outside world. Give me the solution to the

56
00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:10,410
first puzzle. I want pre-backseat gaming. We are all doomed. So we just wrote go left.

57
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:28,339
Alcohol distiller. This is like Hotline Miami. Table. Search. Pill. You can have 30 pills.

58
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:39,019
Is this my inventory? Notepad. My old notepad. Examine it. Nothing interesting apparently

59
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:51,750
happening. Nothing on here. There's no secrets. There's no clues on here. Okay. Chair. Drag the

60
00:08:51,750 --> 00:09:01,370
chair. All right. I'm going to block the door in case anybody comes in. All right. Alcohol distiller.

61
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,110
A homemade device for producing moonshine. The audio is too low. Is the audio too low?

62
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:22,120
Hold on. Let me help you out here. That's probably better. How's that? Better? I think so.

63
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,320
A homemade device for producing moonshine. Okay. I don't have any moonshine. That's my health bar

64
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,940
and my stamina bar. Do it louder than this. Yeah, but it's a scary game. I don't want it to be that

65
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:41,899
loud. No, I know where it is. Apply these. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody wants it to be loud

66
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,570
when like the monster jumps through the fucking window. I get it. There you go. There's your

67
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:54,539
immersion. It's going to be loud and scary. Okay. That's good. Somebody think of a title,

68
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:03,539
by the way, while I do this. Better? Wooden door open. Is there a sprint? There is. It takes,

69
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,500
what is that? It takes stamina. Barricaded window. Dismantling this now would be suicide.

70
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,480
All right. Okay. So this is a post-apocalyptic zombie world.

71
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,230
Potatoes. The only edible thing growing on this land. I still have some left.

72
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,990
What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Why am I tying my shoes?

73
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:39,879
Oh God. This generator is almost out of juice. I need to find a full gasoline can. I saw a broken

74
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:46,330
tractor to the east. Maybe I could find some gasoline there. Go left. Thanks for the tip.

75
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:59,379
Appreciate that. Nothing in the cages. This time they're empty. Nothing in the cage.

76
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:11,289
No, I just have some pills. Chair. What the fuck? My old zenith camera. Can I spin it around or

77
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:20,169
something? Can I take it with me? My old useless medical bag. It's a bag. It's not useless. Photo.

78
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:33,940
Oh, I see. There's like a, there's a ghost in this photo. 1985. All right. So did I take these

79
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:41,210
photos? I took this photo. All right. What about over here? I would rather not open it. I spent

80
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:48,169
too much time to lock him in there. I mean, lock who in there? But this guy I don't care about,

81
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:53,289
by the way. The guy in here. Container. The lock is jammed a long time ago. Never mind. I used to

82
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:56,330
keep useless junk in there anyways. Why do you have so much useless stuff? What's with all the

83
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:07,830
donuts? I don't know how to do that. How to do what? Him. Him. All right. Well, where's it gonna go?

84
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,950
I need to find a can of gasoline to the east. Locked. I think I left the key in the wardrobe.

85
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:23,190
Oh, come on. Where's the wardrobe? My tools. They haven't been sterilized for years. The

86
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,730
local patients can't be helped anyways. All right. So I can't use them. Where's the wardrobe?

87
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:42,500
This is not a wardrobe right here. Isn't this a wardrobe? How do I leave my house?

88
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:51,059
How do I leave the house? Locked. I think I left the key in the wardrobe. Oh, there's another room

89
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,899
here. You can only select and interact with objects within your reach. The interaction

90
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:05,059
range is indicated by the color-changing cursor. Color-changing cursor. Oh, okay. All right. Let's

91
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:12,259
look at the bed. Just woke up. Radio Unitra. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Look

92
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,259
more than an ass. Oh, the radio has been silent for years. Although sometimes I think it can

93
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:29,059
hear voices through the static. I guess. I don't know. Wardrobe. There we go. All right. I know

94
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:38,169
these notes by heart. I don't want to... What did it say? Quickly produced moonshine. Barely filtered.

95
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:51,799
So what does this do? Board. Matchstick. Rag. Key. Where'd it go? What? My medical book. I thought

96
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,250
that was a picture of... I thought that was a picture of me for a second. I don't know why I

97
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,669
thought it for one second. Okay. So this is some kind of illness that's been spreading.

98
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:12,620
Okay. Anything else in the book? All right. Hold on. Board. Matchstick. Can I like use the

99
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:20,149
board as a weapon? All right. I have the board selected so I can just like cross somebody in

100
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:27,899
the head with this, right? All right. Well, I got the key. Locked. I think I left the key in

101
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:34,700
the wardrobe. I have the key on me. How do I get in my inventory? The cursor has a plus icon next

102
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:44,600
to it. You can hold left mouse button to open the selected object's action menu. Got it. All right.

103
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:59,580
I'm ready. This is a dog. What do I do? Wait. Hammer. Can I use the hammer? Destroyed well.

104
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,710
Rope. This is a survival game. I don't have to survive in this game.

105
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:13,750
My 125p. It used to be a luxury, but since all the access roads have been devoured by the woods,

106
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:21,659
it became a useless pile of trash. The People's Tribune. Daily newspaper of the Polish People's

107
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:32,950
Republic. Okay. To Edward Geirich. Oh, this is not English. Something about the United States

108
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:48,389
right here. Anybody read Polish? I don't know what that says. Deduced. My dog. I don't think

109
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:54,940
he's going to make it. I should end his suffering. No! No, not the dog. Immediately you're going to

110
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:03,340
throw the dog at me. I don't know what to do. How? Wooden doll. A large humanoid dog with a carved

111
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:19,940
out face. Okay. That was like loud. I don't like this. Barricaded window. So what's the point?

112
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,960
What's over here? Do I actually have to walk through the dark woods? Is that the whole point?

113
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:35,990
I don't know what to do about the dog. I really don't know what to do. For a space to vault over

114
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:52,490
obstacles like fences or windows. It's the title. You said the title. Can I like alcohol? No. Like

115
00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:05,240
I can't. I don't know what to do. Oh, it's actually you actually have to vault. Okay.

116
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,859
I got to put both headphones in for this because people are going to scream at me.

117
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:29,180
All right. Go east. Do I have a compass? I got an axe. All right. Axe. A formidable weapon. Oh,

118
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:38,089
sick. Okay. So you hold right, you hold right trigger and you get a cursor and you just

119
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:46,519
overhead swing into things. Do I cut down trees? I don't think so. All right. Go east. This is

120
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,880
south. Although I don't know which way I'm facing. So it could be, it could be anything.

121
00:17:51,990 --> 00:18:16,069
Dog, dog, dog, dog. Oh, I don't want to do this though. Oh, I'm sorry. Be at peace.

122
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:25,900
I missed. I'm sorry. Be at peace. Oh my God. I can't even do it. I'm sorry. Be at peace.

123
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm not doing a very good job. This is fucking embarrassing. My dog. I don't think he's gonna

124
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:49,079
make it. I should end his suffering. I don't know how to do that. What do you mean you don't know

125
00:18:49,079 --> 00:19:02,279
how to do that? I left click dog. My dog. Middle mouse. I don't know how to do that. Right click.

126
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:07,400
He won't swing. No, this is not an all right scenario. This is a horrible scenario.

127
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:19,259
Uh, Freddie Dredd just gave 10,000 bits. Here's some bits for your boy. Thank you for streaming.

128
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:41,400
Then left click. I don't like this game. All right. So I don't like this game. I'm gonna do

129
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,900
the coloring book instead. Uh, but thank you, Freddie Dredd for the 10,000 bits. Really appreciate

130
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,670
it. So it's not hold and let go. It's hold and then left click. And then Clown Daddy just gave

131
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,630
five community subs. Thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate it. With a weapon

132
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,019
selected in your hot. I just had to walk five feet. Uh, with a weapon in your hot bar,

133
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:07,859
hold right mouse button to take aim, then press left while aiming to attack. Okay. Sure. Right.

134
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:18,490
Tree. Knock down the tree. Loud. Too loud. I don't like how loud this is. All right. These trees are

135
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:27,380
growing too fast. Soon. I won't be able to cut them down fast enough. Bear trap. Pick it up.

136
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:36,680
Okay. Dead cow cow bone. Uh, all right. I got a cow bone. Does the weapons have, weapons have

137
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:46,539
durability. Look at that. It's already like almost done. What about up here? Left shift. What does

138
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:57,259
that say? Left shift? What left shift? Run location found path. What are you talking about? Location

139
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:08,009
found. All right. Where's East? I'm going East, right? I can hear shit behind me. What does that

140
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:12,630
mean? Is this the radio on silent hill? When you start to hear like the weird echoey music,

141
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,950
it means that there's something like a monster or something, right? I'm going to get ready.

142
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:25,240
To access the map, press M. This is like an, this is like a stomach and intestinal track.

143
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,299
This is where I am. Your position on the map is not marked. When you discover a new location,

144
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:40,440
it will be added to your map. The location you are currently in is indicated in red. In order not to

145
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,240
get lost, you need to learn how to determine your position relative to the discovered locations and

146
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:53,990
landmarks. All right, so I'm here. I got to go down. Oh, this is gonna be, I'm so glad I have

147
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,730
you guys here. I'm so happy you guys are here. You guys can help me. The woods have been, have

148
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,970
devoured all the roads that connected us to the outside world. No one is able to pass through this

149
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:19,579
thicket. Unless they had an axe, of course. I'm gonna, I've, I've drank like two cups of coffee

150
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:25,019
today. So I'm already really jumpy. Just to make sure everybody's aware of that. I'm so glad I have

151
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,299
a limiter on my mic now because like I'm gonna scream at some point probably. It's gonna be so

152
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:37,019
loud, but I have a limiter. What's this? Burns campfire. To immediately transfer items between

153
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,940
inventories, hold left control or left shift when clicking. Okay. Can I have, can I have more than

154
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:52,039
one rag? How many boards can I have? Seven. How many matches can I have? 21. How many rags can I

155
00:22:52,039 --> 00:23:00,230
have in one stack? Five. What do I do with these though? Should I go up? Wait, where am I? Okay,

156
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:19,509
I'm here. There's an up, wait, check down here. What's that? Oh, there's light over there. Happy

157
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:27,720
Halloween, by the way, guys. Do a tuber voice. Why would I do a tuber voice right now? These parts

158
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:37,130
of the woods are dark. I should craft a torch. Tab is your, this wasn't here before. Uh, crafting

159
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:46,119
torch. You have seven boards. You need one, one, one. It's okay. Craft a torch. How many should I

160
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:55,349
make? Should I make one in one? What's a super torch? Oh, this is a gasoline torch. Okay.

161
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:07,220
All right. So I have, okay. So did, okay. I can, all right. You can swing this. Oh, for the love

162
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:21,190
of God. I have to switch weapons. Can I kill people with the torch? I hope so. Where am I?

163
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:32,500
I don't know. Up. I have to go up. Abandoned house. Where is the house? Where's the, oh,

164
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,660
it's right here. There's a wall here. All right. I got to be ready. I got ready to burn a motherfucker.

165
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:42,940
No, don't barricade this door. Go in. Should I be going, should I go in here?

166
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:55,859
Chair. Wardrobe. Oh shit. There's rags in here. Nice. Bread. I'm out of space.

167
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:02,900
Rag. Should I make, I'm going to make some more torches. I think that's what I'm going to do.

168
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:18,039
Right? Yeah. How long does this last? Matchstick torch. Torch. Can I stack them?

169
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,410
I can't stack the torches. What about bone? They last for 20 minutes. All right. What about the

170
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,690
pills? What about the board? Turn the lights on. This is post-apocalyptic world. There's no lights.

171
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:40,180
I kind of want to take this stuff though. Rag. Bread. I need to take this bread. Why am I saying

172
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:48,259
so fucking strangely? Bread. Bread. Bread. Rope torch. Should I just eat the bread? I'm dying

173
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:56,900
right now. Why do I have health? How do I eat it? Your lungs are more efficient because you ate

174
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:10,650
bread. What? Did I inhale it? How do you save the game? Is there a save? Okay. There's somebody

175
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:26,390
like out here. Hit the X. I get the fuck out of here. All right. I'm out. I got, I ate the bread.

176
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:34,470
That means I'm not hungry anymore. Is there a save? There's no save. All right. Where the fuck

177
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:41,990
am I? All right. There's the house. I got to go right. Can I vault? Can I climb this? I don't

178
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:57,180
think I can climb that. Can I go through here? You can only save at a cooking station. All right. Up

179
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,970
maybe. Over here. Because I came from this way though. I'm already lost in the woods. I have no

180
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:19,849
idea where I'm going. All right. This thing's going to get up. In a few days it will be completely

181
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:28,069
absorbed. Absorbed into what? Clothes. Fucking rags. I don't, I don't know. I don't want it to,

182
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:37,029
I don't know what to do with the rags. Clothes. Searched. Yep. More rags. There's a deer over here

183
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:54,390
or an elk or a moose. I don't know. Whatever this is supposed to be. Ah, I hate it. Clothes. Rags. I

184
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:02,470
don't need rags. My medical bag? It's useless. So it's worth, but it's worth a hundred bucks.

185
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:12,460
I don't understand. Why is it worth so much money? Who do you sell stuff to in this game?

186
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:31,059
All right. Made it through this. I haven't been in here though. Doorway. Repair. Search these clothes.

187
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:37,779
More rags. I don't, I wish there would be more than five stacks. A bottle? An empty glass bottle?

188
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:51,819
I don't think I need this stuff. More rags. What am I going to do with these rags? They're coming.

189
00:28:51,819 --> 00:29:02,470
Who's coming? No one's coming. Don't say that. Don't say they're coming. So I gotta go up.

190
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:18,599
All right. Slow down. I can't run that. All right. Guy. Guy over here. Do I have to put this, put this

191
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:28,579
guy at peace too? I probably, I'm walking over with an axe, but still. I think this one is still

192
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:38,740
breathing. Be at peace. Can I talk? Big metal key. If there is an exit out of these woods, this key

193
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:48,940
will surely open it. Number 21. He's unconscious. I've never seen him around here before. It's me.

194
00:29:48,940 --> 00:30:01,660
It's gonna be me. He's only carrying a key and some journal. Since he managed to sneak in here,

195
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:19,240
he must know how to get out. Of course he won't help me voluntarily. So wrench. That is of no

196
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:39,910
importance. I need to get out of this accursed forest. You hear me? Rat! Where's the rat? Show

197
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:56,950
me how and I will let you go. I sometimes hear her voice. She's calling me. Calling me to return

198
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:17,930
home. Where is the exit? Am I interrogating this person? Where's the exit? Show me where. I don't

199
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,289
even know if, for all I know this could be just some person that just like went wandering in the

200
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:38,329
woods. Hey! I'll kill you like a dog if I have to. So I'm the bad, I'm the bad guy. What if you don't

201
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:49,160
kill the dog? I'm the, I knew I was the bad guy and now I'm this guy. Yep. And now I gotta kill me

202
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:56,180
who was me in the tutorial. You got it. That fucker stole my key. And enter into a small cell and

203
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,220
maybe the pantry. Let's get in. Use the lockpick. I have lockpick. Search. I couldn't open it with a

204
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,779
lockpick. I could open it with a lockpick. Okay. Crafting. I can make a lockpick. How do I make a

205
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:13,849
lockpick? One lockpick is two lockpicks. What? Why would two lockpicks make one lockpick?

206
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:23,380
Needs two, oh, it's like wire. Oh, that's not what it, okay. All right. Hey, uh, hey, my stomach

207
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,819
hurts. I'm gonna puke in here, man. Fucking best way to do it. All right. Let's see what else we got.

208
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:40,980
The barricade's too strong. All right. Easy. Let's make that lockpick and get out of here.

209
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:50,380
Neat. Okay. Lockpick. I can always make gauze. Heals wounds. All right. Let's use that. Nice

210
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:58,940
tutorial. Teach me how to use gauze. Okay. So use gauze. You, okay. Use. Using it. All right.

211
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:08,230
Lockpick. Let's do it. Unlocked. What's in the container? A shovel. It's heavy, but it has good

212
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:21,269
reach and a flashlight. All right. So I got to bash this guy's head in with the shovel.

213
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:28,250
It's too strong to dismantle. So just smash it down. All right. Does he hear that?

214
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:45,369
The item is no longer usable. Okay. I'm out. Wait, he was right in front of me. He was literally

215
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:57,980
right there. Okay. It took me so long to register that he was standing there. Holy shit. My, like,

216
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:12,760
pee brain. That's supposed to scare you immediately. And it took me, syringe. Fuck. Can I hit him with

217
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:21,610
the flashlight? I better not leave the house at night. It's safer here. Is this just a series of

218
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,409
taking the house from the person who squatted in the house before you?

219
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:38,780
What the fuck is this guy? Lamp. Turn the lamp on. Turn it on. How many batteries are in this

220
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:53,320
flashlight? Oh, there's a code. Please let me out. What? There's other people in here. All right.

221
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:03,099
Hold on. What is that? Is it a bomb? I think it's a bomb. All right. Don't touch this. It's a bomb.

222
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:08,139
That's a bomb. That's a bomb. Right? Stuff doesn't blink red unless it's a bomb.

223
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:18,619
Dismantle the bomb. Turn. All right. It's not a bomb. It's a radio. No, it's a bomb. Right?

224
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:36,179
Why is it connected over here? How do I get the fucking thing open? What about over here? This is

225
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:46,420
connected to this. Lamp on. Search the... What's going on? Can I punch? This is the... The radio

226
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,119
needs to be dialed to like a certain frequency, right? And then the frequency will open the door.

227
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:27,380
Oh, that was fucking easy. All right. Watch out. Somebody in here? Somebody in there? There's like

228
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,860
a torture device in here. All right. Generator. Don't turn it on yet. That's going to activate

229
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:42,550
everything. Meal table. A meal table with leather belt strapped on. Metal table. A meal... A meal

230
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:52,039
table. What's in here? Why did everything turn off? This is going to be somebody in here. He's

231
00:36:52,039 --> 00:37:05,429
going to be in this box. Okay. No, there's nobody in the box. It's just gasoline. Table leg. Use it

232
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:12,659
as a weapon. You got it. Uh, I'm going to keep the shovel though, just in case I need it. Fuck

233
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:19,690
out of here. I need the code. How do I get the code to let the other person out? Generator on.

234
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,530
Let's go. To refill the generator, click the gasoline tank. Cover your mouse over the generator.

235
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,250
Hold right mouse button, followed by the left mouse button to pour the gasoline. All right.

236
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:43,050
I'm going to smash this guy's head in. How much do I have to refill it? I have to refill it that

237
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:55,989
much. Incoming joke alert. Incoming joke alert. Oh man. I've been playing wow for like fucking

238
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:04,340
six hours. When am I going to get to 60? Everybody fucking laugh immediately at that hilarious

239
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:23,619
fucking wow reference. Yes. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually pay attention.

240
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:44,869
Not funny. Didn't laugh. Yes, you fucking did. I saw it. I told you it was a bomb. The corpse

241
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:49,110
has two dials instead of eyes. His mouth is wide open and I can hear a distorted voice.

242
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:53,030
Barely distinguishable from the radio static. Turn on the generator. Turn on the generator.

243
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:10,300
Wait, it's not on. All right. He's going to get up. Right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Right. When he

244
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,380
comes up, this is going right in his head. The corpse has two dials. His mouth. I can hear it.

245
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:46,730
Barely just come from radio static. 4892. 4892. Okay. 4892. Got it. Who the fuck's in here?

246
00:39:47,449 --> 00:40:13,530
Door seems stuck. I need to apply some force to it. Help me. You don't say come closer if you need

247
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:18,010
help. That's like what the witches and the fucking bad guys from Disney movies tell you.

248
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:44,539
I knew it. You fucking Disney witch. I didn't even know there was a corner there really. I just saw

249
00:40:44,539 --> 00:41:07,130
it. Plastic chick. It's a bomb. This is a bomb. Oh, who's laughing? Right. And how do you will

250
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:16,139
want to get out now? You think you can man age all by yourself? Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

251
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:32,360
Hear it. Next motherfucker that comes near me is getting blocked in the fucking head. Who's in the

252
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,880
house? Somebody coming in the house right now. All right. I got to get out of the house, I think.

253
00:41:37,880 --> 00:42:01,510
Did I lose? Or is that script? That's script. That was fucking terrifying. I hate fucking two

254
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:13,739
headphones. Now this is too loud. I have to drop this. It's too much. I was stretching the hand.

255
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,139
Leave the volume. No, it's too loud for me. It's too loud for you guys. Chapter one.

256
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,760
Don't do it or I'll leave. What? Don't turn the volume down a little bit so you'll leave?

257
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:41,909
Is this me again? All right. I have no stuff. Bandages with alcohol. Good for heavy wounds.

258
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:49,860
A pleasant worth is emanating from the oven. I can sense a strange yet familiar scent.

259
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,699
It's the smell of the protective substance, which gives me relative safety after dark.

260
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,949
The vapors rising from the huge cauldron are distributed all over the house via long pipes.

261
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,869
As long as I remain inside my hideout, I have a chance of surviving the night.

262
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:10,630
Examine the oven. Look at the weird bottle. Let's examine that. When I arrived here a couple days

263
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,269
ago, the oven was basically prepared. I just needed to light it up to ensure my safety at night.

264
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:22,489
This cottage must have been one of our hideouts. One of our hideouts. The inhabitants of these

265
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:30,309
woods don't need to inhale this revolting gas. Well, it's a weird bottle. The label on the bottle

266
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,829
says staying out of the reach of the protective substance after nightfall results in immediate

267
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:41,989
death in 99 out of 100 cases. It's advised to evenly spread the gas inside the sleeping area.

268
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:52,039
Okay, so you have to be in the gas. Warning! Even a properly prepared substance does not guarantee

269
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:57,800
100% safety. Remain vigilant. It is recommended to stay in well-lit indoor areas in order to

270
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:06,889
minimize the risk. So we need to have set up a stove that has gas coming out of it.

271
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,809
A small empty cast iron pot. I haven't used it yet. I haven't felt any hunger or thirst

272
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:16,090
since the accident a few days ago. I can't stop thinking about one thing. These mushrooms,

273
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:21,530
these red pulsating mushrooms, they look so tasty. Maybe this pot will prove useful after all.

274
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:37,179
Oven efficiency one. You just make a giant mushroom syringe? Holy shit. Okay, well, I don't

275
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:46,659
have anything. This is essence. Dose one. That's, oh, that's what you meant when you said cooking

276
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:53,239
saved the game. I see. All right, let's go. Turn the lamp on. I can't even turn anything. Wardrobe.

277
00:44:53,239 --> 00:45:00,119
Nothing in there except there's a nail. Use that as a weapon. I don't think I can. Rag. And photo of

278
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:16,090
road. The road home. Wooden door. I think this is fairly safe in here, but I've been wrong. It's

279
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,500
okay. And cranky dog shit. Yesterday I barricaded one of the windows. If I want to stay for some

280
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:37,210
time, I should do the same with the other windows. Okay, done. Workbench. Repair. I know, man, this

281
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:45,719
is gonna get, this is gonna get nasty for me. Hotbar upgrade. So I get more slots. I need one

282
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:58,739
blanket and one wire. Board with nails. Antidote cures poison. Gas bottle. Okay. Upgrade workshop.

283
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:05,019
I need six boards. I need, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's just hold on. I can't

284
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:18,869
board these up. Large mushrooms. Harvest them. Got it. Odd looking mushroom. Cookable. Okay.

285
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,699
All right. Y'all are gonna think I'm insane for doing this, but I'm gonna bind sprint to

286
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,019
one of my mouse buttons. I mean, I know y'all are gonna think I'm insane for doing that,

287
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:48,360
but I have to. Okay. Sprint. Run. Left shift. No. It's gonna be mouse button five.

288
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:58,070
That's a thousand times better. So now if I want to go left and sprint, I don't have to hit A and

289
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:05,820
then shift with my pinky. Much better. Got it. All right. Is this a streamer that sprints with his

290
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:15,059
mouse? Yes. All right. So we've got mushroom. Oh, wait. What'd I just do? Is this like to level

291
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:24,889
up your health or something? Yeah. It's, uh, you, you collect mushrooms and you put it in there and

292
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:32,739
you level it up. Yeah. Right here. Check this out. Harvest these and then I can, I fill it up with

293
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:38,599
syringe and then syringe myself in the neck and I'll get another bar of HP. Got it. So they've

294
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,199
wrought over time though, which is trying to figure out what that means, how long that takes.

295
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:53,190
I'll look for a couple more of these things. What's that? Night. You are in the hideout

296
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,309
under the influence of the protective substance. It will help you survive. Okay.

297
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:11,079
Build a well. I don't want to build a fucking well. Saw. Use a saw. Convert wood logs to planks.

298
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:22,409
Okay. I can make planks. Do I have to like fall out for this house? Is that what's going on here?

299
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:32,599
I want another mushroom. They're going to map too. All right. Underground entrance.

300
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:37,500
That's the X. That's where I got to go. Right? What's the mission? What's the goal of the whole

301
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:54,659
game? I don't know. Let me put that mushroom back in here. All right. They're worth 10 each.

302
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:04,579
Escape the forest. All right. Sounds easy enough. I need to barricade this though. Look at how

303
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:12,760
fucked up this is. Wait, what's in here? This generator is half empty. It contains enough

304
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,880
gasoline for one more night. I should find a full can in the house above the underground entrance.

305
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,880
Oh shit. You have some stuff on you. Got a torch on you. Thanks, man.

306
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,710
Native weapons have secondary attack. Try it by pressing mouse four.

307
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:40,250
Okay. It's an overhead swing. All right. Now I need to get the gas that's under the

308
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:46,409
underground entrance. Say that again one more time. I have enough for one more night.

309
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:58,309
That's not good. Okay. I can't sprint around everywhere. Don't waste the torch. Oh, sorry.

310
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:02,900
So how do I get over there? There's an underground entrance.

311
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:25,190
There's a full can of gas over here. Where? Full can of gas? There's a dog. Is it a

312
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,670
is it a poisoned dog? Or is it a regular? Sounds like a regular dog.

313
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:54,630
Okay. Dog. Is it a regular dog or is it an infected dog? Is there a difference in this game?

314
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:03,909
Is that an affected dog? Is this dog affected? You don't sound infected.

315
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,190
Get out of here.

316
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:39,610
God damn it. Where's the underground entrance? I need to find the full can of gasoline or I'm

317
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:47,030
not going to be able to survive another night. Oh, that's where I am. I have to go up into the left.

318
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:52,360
Loot the dog. The dog is still alive. I can't loot the dog.

319
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:03,159
Is there a beetle? There are more than one dog now.

320
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,469
I need to get the gasoline or I can't do this. Gasoline. All right. I'm going this way.

321
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:33,940
There's always a bigger dog. Just don't go near the dogs. I don't know what the fuck they are.

322
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,500
They're just like hanging out. They're just in random spots. Okay. I need to go this way.

323
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,780
Underground entrance. Get me up there. I'm just going to run away from the dogs if I see them.

324
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:50,780
Is it nighttime? This is the sun's out. Is the sun out right? All right. There's a dog.

325
00:52:51,420 --> 00:53:06,099
Why did they just... Okay. I'm here. Underground entrance. Where is it? Underground entrance. I'm

326
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:13,030
here. Where's the underground entrance? Found it right there. Don't step on the bear trap

327
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:35,659
and give it to me. Okay. Is this it? Am I in like a zone I'm not supposed to be in?

328
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:47,449
Bear trap. If I climb through this window, I'll get... I'll step in it and I don't want to step

329
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:54,010
in that. Why can I... I cannot punch. This is the house. I'll find the entrance to the underground

330
00:53:54,010 --> 00:54:01,190
here and I'm not bleeding so I'll be okay for a little while. I gotta get more mushrooms.

331
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:16,630
Watch it for this shit. I'm going to step in this. The cyclops are currently supposed to eat.

332
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:30,739
Eat. I don't have anything. Oh, I can make another bandage. Not as well. Bed. Backpack.

333
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:34,679
Ooh, nice. Okay. Bread. Pills. What do the pills do?

334
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,119
Medium caliber. But there's guns in this game? And a battery? Wait, there's guns.

335
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:56,280
Ooh, shit. All right. Lockpick. Nail. A couple of rags. There it is. Full gasoline. Pack of...

336
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:10,760
I thought that was... It's a pack of cigarettes. Looks like an apple. Oh, that's why it looks

337
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:18,840
like that. Okay. I guess it's just an interesting thing to find. All right. I got the... Do I have

338
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:25,900
a weapon? I have a weapon, right? Do I have a weapon? I don't have any weapon. Make a torch

339
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:40,309
and a bandage. Fuck. Okay, move this. Am I stuck here? No, not anymore.

340
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:59,559
Oh, it's these mushrooms. Nice. Okay, good. You used... Wait, what are you talking about? What?

341
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:19,099
I used the gasoline? Why did I use the gasoline? I dumped it on the torch? Why would I do that?

342
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:35,219
Wow. I thought it was a person. I thought there was a specific gasoline torch. It's a red one. I

343
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:44,340
don't have a red one in my inventory. See? Like gasoline torch. Look. Oh, I made that one. Well,

344
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,260
fuck. Is that going to be the mistake that ends this whole thing and I have to restart the whole

345
00:56:48,260 --> 00:57:02,840
game? Tell me now. Okay, I'm going to examine it. The entrance to the underground tunnels.

346
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:09,989
I don't have any stuff. Why am I... How am I going to do anything down here? At least the game saved.

347
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:19,349
I have a mushroom. I don't want to... I can't... I don't know. What am I looking for down here?

348
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:24,619
I don't even know what I'm trying to do down here. What's the point of down here?

349
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:38,059
I need a torch. I have a... Wait a minute. You're telling me that the torch with the gasoline on it...

350
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:55,320
Oh, it's alcohol, technically. Rubble. The tunnel walls were crushed by enormous roots. Dig.

351
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:09,210
I don't have a shovel. Shit. Nothing over here. Let's keep going. Go home. Go home. Go home. Go

352
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:14,969
home. Should I go home? A light bulb dimly lits the wet walls of the underground passage. The

353
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:19,210
further part is shrouded in complete darkness. I need a light source to continue. Keep going. Go.

354
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:27,289
Go home. The thick wooded posts barely hold the soap brown and the tangled roots. The construction

355
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:46,469
seems on the verge of collapse. I'm going home. I'm going... I'm at her. I'm going home. Okay.

356
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:53,510
I have mushrooms to deposit into my mushroom syringe bank. Okay, now I gotta go this way.

357
00:58:54,070 --> 00:59:08,820
There's a dog. Where the fuck are these dogs? Out here into the right... Wait, what's up here?

358
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:17,860
I'm so glad I have this stereo audio so that I can hear where they're coming from.

359
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:26,119
All right, I'm just gonna go. I gotta deposit that mushroom and then I'm gonna make a... I need to

360
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:36,900
make a weapon or something. I have to barricade boards and windows and... This way. What... What

361
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:50,440
day is it? What time is it? Do I even have that knowledge right now? Oh, you motherfucker. Where

362
00:59:50,440 --> 01:00:10,309
are you? Is there any way I can see what time it is? All right. So, generator. Gasoline. Fill it up.

363
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:27,019
Okay, here we go. Right? This is what I'm supposed to be doing. Right? I'm going for it. And I'm going

364
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:42,889
to assume that the bar is a day. One of those bars is one day worth of fuel. Right? Okay. So,

365
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:49,780
I have two days, two and a half days worth of fuel. Now, climb over here. There's probably like a

366
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:59,989
creeper in the house now because I haven't barricaded any windows. The bear trap under the window is

367
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,750
still open. Looks like this night was exceptionally uneventful. I didn't put that there, did I?

368
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:12,039
Okay. Oh, fuck. There's stuff in here. Okay. Rope. Two pieces of alcohol, two pieces of bottle,

369
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:21,590
and a mushroom book. The title reads, The Use of Mushrooms in the Household. That's what it was.

370
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:29,610
People are doing shrooms and giving themselves this like post-apocalyptic disease. All right.

371
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:40,619
We're almost there. Two more. Game is saved. Now, I need to craft some stuff. Bandages with alcohol.

372
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:49,059
Battery. Do I have a stash or anything? Can I stash? I can stash this stuff in here.

373
01:01:51,300 --> 01:02:01,289
Right? I can just put it in here. All right. Well, I don't need half of this stuff. I can

374
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:08,409
put the pills in here. Scrap metal. Is there a way I can just control and do it? Yeah. Okay.

375
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:14,010
I'm going to keep the lockpick. Keep the alcohol. I'll keep one alcohol, one rag.

376
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:19,849
Keep the bread. I don't need the rope. Do I need these things? I don't know if I need these things.

377
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:33,849
Or not. I have no idea. Nails? What do they do? I don't know. Check your journal. Items. Keys.

378
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:41,079
Journal. Me. Skills. You. Skills. Okay. So I need. I don't have any planks though.

379
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:57,050
Varricade. Varricade. I need three planks. I don't have any planks. Let's look at planks.

380
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:03,989
All right. I think I'm. I need a weapon. There's a sandwich outside. There's not a sandwich outside.

381
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:18,860
I guarantee it. What do I have to do with this stuff? Lock all the doors with furniture.

382
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:39,429
That's what I was thinking. Wait. Otherwise people can get in here. See what I mean? Like,

383
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:48,389
people can get in that. Planks. I'm going to go on a plank mission. Can I move the bed?

384
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:58,949
I cannot drag the bed. All right. I got. Let me consolidate. So empty bottle. I'm getting

385
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:06,340
rid of this. Back to my stash. Turn. Turn on the generator. Turn the generator on. Why?

386
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:15,179
What are you talking about? I'll fucking have to. No. Leave that. Generator. Generator. Generator.

387
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:30,679
Generator. I'm going. What? Everybody just relax. Look. Hey. There we go. How I. I mean,

388
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:40,760
it's kind of annoying. Should I save energy? Does it burn? I don't want to just leave my lights on

389
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:56,900
and leave the house. Doesn't that sound bad? Keep them on. All right. Don't leave during the night.

390
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:04,119
What the fuck? Don't leave during the night. What the fuck? So what do I just hang out? How

391
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:21,019
do I? Can I sleep at night? How do you sleep? So I just have to hang out here. Stay safe until

392
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:33,260
daytime comes. What was my watch? I don't even know what time it is. You wait, fucker. Oh my

393
01:05:33,260 --> 01:06:02,710
goodness. This is because I'm looking over here. I'm looking over at you guys and everyone's like,

394
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:07,349
just hang out in the house. Hang out in the house. Don't step on the fucking bear trap.

395
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,559
You knew it was going to happen like once, right? Like it was going to happen one time.

396
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:19,300
It might as well happen once. I thought somebody threw an axe through the window. I really thought

397
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:26,539
somebody threw an object at me. All right. Stop. Am I bleeding? How do you tell if you're bleeding?

398
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:43,960
Go near the light, please. I just stepped in a fucking bear trap. There's no more bears.

399
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,920
I'm not setting traps. I'm not setting bear traps. Go to the light. All right. All right.

400
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:58,920
All right. I'm next to the light. I'm fine. And now I'm going to heal. There. There's nobody in

401
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:18,139
the house, right? There's nobody in here. Did that say possible mushroom? Poisonous mushrooms.

402
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:30,920
Why is it coming out of the ground? What? That was possible mushrooms. I was right. Okay. Mushrooms.

403
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,150
What's that sound? What's that sound? What's that? Stand next to the light. Next to the light.

404
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:57,420
Just put a ton of light over here. I hear somebody sprinting. Get the fuck away from me. Do I need

405
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:15,460
the torch? No, I have this. I'm just going to drag it around with me. Be quiet. I'm standing in a

406
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:29,529
gigantic halogen light bulb. It's too dangerous to cook during the night. Close the door. I can't.

407
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:40,180
Okay. I can. Close the door. That one is barricaded. Is there something going to come in here?

408
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:54,569
I don't have any barricades. No. I don't even know what that means. Wait. Somebody said the

409
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:59,460
first night's not bad. What? Is this like Five Nights at Freddy's? Is by like night four there's

410
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:15,930
going to be random fucking animatronics running around this house? Great. How many days? How many

411
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:23,609
days until like somebody else has to take the shift? Look outside. I'm not looking outside.

412
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:46,260
Someone's going to grab me through the window. No. How do I know it's daytime? Look around the

413
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:51,289
corner. All right. I'm going to bring my fucking light source with me so I don't get in trouble.

414
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:06,439
Is this like holy water? Is this going to burn them or something? Why isn't music doing this?

415
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:35,539
I did it. I survived today. All right. Now turn the generator off. I don't need this light anymore.

416
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:47,430
Look at how fucking much that's too much. I need gasoline. Okay. All it needs is to have to just go.

417
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:10,920
Okay. Quickly. Quickly. Wood legs. Nothing in there. I need to go now. Clock. Time freeze. Why?

418
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:16,760
We need time freeze. Why is time frozen? I have like a time. I get a setup phase. There's an NPC

419
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:27,640
in here. What? Where? Who the fuck is this? Wolfman. Even from afar, I can smell your

420
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:35,739
futured stench. Be glad I don't have an appetite for carcasses, meat. The figure hides its face

421
01:11:35,739 --> 01:11:43,050
under the hood. It smells of wet soil and fur. He's got like a machine gun. I know what you're

422
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:48,090
after. I can help you reclaim what you've lost. If you help me attend a certain matter, what do you

423
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:55,590
say, comrade? As he leans toward me, I can hear him giggling under the hood. I knew what would

424
01:11:55,590 --> 01:12:01,510
interest you. Before we make a deal, we need to prove that you can do the job. I have no time for

425
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:07,720
weaklings meat. Do you follow? Show me what you're made of. Get through to the silent forest.

426
01:12:08,779 --> 01:12:13,260
You think it's so easy. If I were you, I would prepare myself well before setting out.

427
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,829
When you get there, you will find me in this spot. Remember it. The wolf grabs you by the fucking

428
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:27,130
shirt and rips you towards his face. The likes of you always crawl back to me. The wolf grabs

429
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:37,609
some of that and scribbles something on it. Show item. Does he even trade? Oh, beautiful item.

430
01:12:37,609 --> 01:12:45,590
Perfect for a church fair. So, you want it? Wolf road. What's that you got there? The wolf snatches

431
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:51,350
the photograph from my hand and studies it carefully. Finally, he snorts. His thick yellow spit landing

432
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:59,689
on the photo. Aha! This road doesn't exist anymore. Overgrown with trees like all the other ones.

433
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:06,979
Wolf throws the photo to the ground. Before, better forget about the road home meat. Around

434
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:16,579
here all the roads lead to nowhere. Trade. Oh, he's got a watch. How much money do I have?

435
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:25,460
Where's my money? How much money do I have? All right, I have three empty bottles. Is that enough

436
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:46,250
for a gun? Handgun frame. Reputation is money. Tape. Is that free? Value? No. Chain. I buy weapons

437
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:55,510
and ammo. All right. I need this. 150. I need a weapon. I need something. He has gasoline. 60.

438
01:13:55,510 --> 01:14:11,909
I don't have enough. Here, take a bottle. I don't want that shit. Um, I need to buy gasoline.

439
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:21,109
Alcohol? Wait, I have other stuff. Wait, hold on. Tell me the story. I'd avoid getting in trouble

440
01:14:21,109 --> 01:14:26,539
if I were you, Meat. Or at least until you get a decent weapon. If you wish to spend some more

441
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:30,779
quality time basking in the striking yet natural beauty of my features before you head off to the

442
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:39,109
silent forest, you will find me in my camp. And oh, he's leaving. I want to hold on. Before you

443
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:43,829
head off to the silent forest, you will find me in my camp in the dry meadow. Points to a location

444
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:48,390
on my map. He's not gone, right? All right. You're still here. All right. Give me a second. Just stay

445
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:54,260
there. Where's my wardrobe? All right. I got a bunch of, I got batteries. I got fucking pills.

446
01:14:55,060 --> 01:15:01,880
I got bullets and shit. What did I just do? Okay. Where is it? Okay. I got metal. I got nails.

447
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:22,789
Let's sell the battery. I need that gasoline. I just don't know what this does. Don't sell the

448
01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:28,939
nails. Okay. What about the bullet? 20. All right. That'll give me 50. That'll give me 60, 70 enough

449
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:36,810
for gasoline. That's one bullet. It's, I'm not gonna be able to do shit. That's fine. All right.

450
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:50,329
Give me that. And I want a gasoline, please. 50 minus 40. All right. Okay. The bullet is for you.

451
01:15:50,329 --> 01:16:02,739
What do you mean? Sell the bullet. Buy gasoline. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the business. Now I'm

452
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:12,090
going to fill this shit up to all the way. I think. I don't know. Yeah. Should I? Halfway?

453
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:30,489
Should I do this halfway? Halfway? Get it to half. All right. That's it half. And then I've got other

454
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:36,739
stuff to put gas on. Dump gasoline on ground to make fire. That's not, that's not a bad idea.

455
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:48,279
Thanks for the tip. What else can I do? All right. Go over to this. Yeah. This thing over here.

456
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:57,140
Saw. Use. There's the gasoline over there. That's the EXP bubbles down there. I'm gonna fill this up

457
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:15,380
to. I was supposed to do that? I don't know. Was that, was that supposed to happen? I don't know if

458
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:26,119
I was supposed to. Convert wood logs to planks. Convert wood logs. Aren't there wood logs over here?

459
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:32,310
Wood logs. How do you not have wood logs in a pile of wood logs? It's empty, but it's wood logs.

460
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:38,460
There's wood logs there. Why would there not be wood logs on a pile of wood logs? What the fuck is

461
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:48,279
this game talking about? In the pile of wood logs, there are no wood logs. This should be at least

462
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:57,100
one. I gotta find wood logs. All right. I'm gonna find some wood logs. There's the wolf's camp.

463
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:04,039
Wolf's camp. Silent forest. There's like the portal. All right. I'm gonna go to find wood logs.

464
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,569
How do you get wood logs? Do I have to cut down trees? I don't have an axe. Are they just lying

465
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:27,750
around? They're locked. Good thing I got a lock pick. Get it open. Ooh. Full container of gasoline.

466
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:42,359
That hurt a dog. This is my only weapon. I have to save it. Wait, can I hit people with a bottle?

467
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:59,609
I think I can. But what about a broken glass? Broken glass. Um, what are these pills? Oh, I could.

468
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,409
All right. I can't get the... If I step on the glass, it's gonna hurt me.

469
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:18,060
This game seems pretty realistic. Wait, I need logs. Wait, I gotta go back. More gasoline. Okay,

470
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:34,920
so gasoline is gonna go into... I'm gonna get rid of it. Do you eat glass? I know. I'm gonna fill...

471
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:44,180
I'm gonna go just gasoline. I can like fill it up the whole way. All right. Let's do that.

472
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:51,029
Right? That's probably not a bad idea. Gasoline here. Let's get it filled. At least enough for

473
01:19:51,510 --> 01:20:00,729
I'm comfortable with it. Because that guy... I'll have plenty of gas. I'm filling the whole thing

474
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:15,420
up. Full tank. Full. Is it nighttime? What have I fucking done all day? What time is it? What time

475
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:45,260
is it? Workshop. Oh, this is a huge inventory. Okay, just put everything in here. Um, chain trap.

476
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:59,270
No, I don't... Repair item. No. Okay, I need to put the syringe thing in here. Odd looking mushroom.

477
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:07,979
20 essence. 30, 40, 50. I got it. It's done. What the hell is this? Staying in dark areas at night

478
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:13,350
can be dangerous to me. Okay, all right. I can see far... This is a level up system. This is how you

479
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:20,329
level up. Okay, I can see further. Once a day I'll be able to heal myself by standing next to an

480
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:27,590
electric light source. Once a day I'll be able to learn my current location on the map. That's pretty...

481
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:37,819
That's... I'll be able to heal myself by eating mushrooms. Any electric light source could be

482
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:50,460
anything. I kind of like the first one. So I could just stay next to anything. Seeing further is

483
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:59,590
important. I don't know. Either one of these two sounds really, really good. I would... If it was

484
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:04,789
me, and because I'm stupid, I would pick this one if I was playing off stream. Because I don't have

485
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:10,939
a fucking chat of 15,000 people to help me. So I don't even need this. Like, we can pretend

486
01:22:10,939 --> 01:22:26,390
that I already clicked this because I have you guys. So I'm gonna just go where it takes me.

487
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:36,380
It's done. I need to choose a negative perk. What do you mean a negative perk? What the fuck you...

488
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:44,199
What do you mean a negative perk? I have to pick this one. What? Staying in dark areas at night

489
01:22:44,199 --> 01:23:03,180
can be dangerous to me. I like being able to see... But I could heal. It's over. I did it.

490
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:16,229
See further. What's that mean? Does it mean like physically actually seeing over here or like the

491
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:22,680
light goes further? Oh, that's not good. That's actually kind of bad. That's not good at all. This

492
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:27,079
is terrible. What's the point of this? It's useless. Shouldn't have got it. I should have got the moth.

493
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:34,859
Too late. Got to sleep in your bed that you make. All right. What time is it? I don't know. Let's

494
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:40,279
go with... I got some bread. I got some bandages. I got... Okay, let's go scavenge. This game's fun.

495
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:52,710
I like this game. All right. Time to scavenge. What time is it? I don't know. He's coping.

496
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:57,130
Actually, that's not bad because I can see pretty damn far. All right. Scavenge.

497
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:16,520
Is it nighttime? Dogs over here. All right. Easy. Burned house. Burned house. All right. I can

498
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:24,680
scavenge in this burned house. I don't know. Those dogs are in there. Dogs are there, but they can't

499
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:48,659
get in the house. They don't have hands. What? It's an open door. Oh, fuck. How many fucking dogs are

500
01:24:48,659 --> 01:25:02,760
there? Oh, there's a tractor over here. There's a log. All right. Hold on. Oh, gasoline and a tire.

501
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:18,229
Nice. Dogs. Don't touch dog. Just... That's not a light, right? Logs? There's debris over there.

502
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:56,979
There's like a big wooden log over there. There's a pig too. There's nobody here. I'm fine.

503
01:25:56,979 --> 01:26:19,449
Okay. I got a log. Oh, what does he got? An ear? I don't know. Get the... Don't do that.

504
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:35,399
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I got it. I'm out of here. I got to leave. I'm out.

505
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:43,060
Time to go. I got a log. Okay. I got a log. Where am I? Burned house. Okay. I got to make... I got

506
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:48,310
to get like a weapon. What happened to me? What was that? What happened? Why am I sick? Why am

507
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:55,239
my character sick? Why is my character sick? Why is he sick? What happened? What's his ween?

508
01:26:55,239 --> 01:27:05,829
You're poisoned. How do I get rid of poison? Bandage? All right. I'm back home. I got to turn

509
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:20,359
the lights on. Okay. I've got... Is it time for the lights? No, not yet. What do I got? I got a couple

510
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:38,149
of planks. All right. Workbench. Board with nails. Got it. I got a weapon now. Okay. What does the

511
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:44,220
ear do? Throwable can be used as bait for carnivores. Okay. I stole some gasoline. I'm

512
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:50,329
going to put it into the tank. Bottle. Let's store the tire because I don't know what the hell this

513
01:27:50,329 --> 01:27:59,289
is for. I'm going to... I'm going to put on the board, I think. I guess. Yeah. Good. Oh, now I

514
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:06,500
feel like I'm ready. I need more bandages. Bandage with alcohol. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's do it.

515
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:14,600
Fuck it. Let's get it. I'm going to eat this food. Does that do anything? Was that a stupid

516
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:30,460
mistake? This is not like Minecraft. No, this doesn't heal you. Okay. That was dumb. I just

517
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:36,119
have more stamina. Well, oh well. All right. Hotbar upgrade. I need to board up some...

518
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:39,000
I only have two boards. All right. I got a weapon. I'm fine. I'm just going to stand next to the...

519
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:45,029
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I have to turn the light on. Turn on the lights now, please.

520
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:50,310
Right? Turn on the light. Turn the light on. Turn on the light. That's like... There's something

521
01:28:50,310 --> 01:29:00,359
happening. Oh, it's rain. It's raining. All right. It's raining. What does that mean?

522
01:29:03,829 --> 01:29:10,310
I didn't mean to swing that. I thought it was like something zoning in. Like the sides of your

523
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:17,029
screen are flickering. It is an animal or a bad... Like a monster or something. I'm just going to

524
01:29:17,029 --> 01:29:26,939
stand here until it's... Is that lightning or is that... Okay. That's lightning. I can't get

525
01:29:26,939 --> 01:29:38,890
struck by lightning, right? There's a roof here. You're doing a great overreacting to everything

526
01:29:38,890 --> 01:30:03,899
joke. I drank three coffees today. I can't help it. This is four. Should I just stay in here?

527
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:12,100
I need to use my daytime. But what's the... What's the actual... You know what else it is, too?

528
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:19,050
I have to talk louder because I'm blocking both my ears. So I'm... It's like somebody has a vacuum

529
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:34,840
cleaner on right now. Thank you. Nice work. You guys nailed it. No, for those of you that are new,

530
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:46,170
if I block both my ears, I've like literally become useless. You know how like Superman has

531
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:51,750
kryptonite and he's like the most powerful entity on earth, right? But if you like hold a kryptonite

532
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:59,210
crystal up to him, he just like... That's what happens to me. Like I could be like the fucking

533
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:03,960
strongest person on earth. If you just covered both my ears, I'd be like... I'd be useless.

534
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:22,819
You're not Superman. Ego maniac. That's my weakness. You're like a shark. What?

535
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:31,819
All right. Is it nighttime? But the question I was going to ask is how do you tell when...

536
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:40,229
How much time is it for a day cycle in the game? An hour? 30 minutes? 20 minutes? What's... How do

537
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:51,859
I know? You can tell from your light, okay? You find the watch. I could have bought a watch.

538
01:31:57,699 --> 01:32:03,140
When the light gets orange, that's when it's getting dark. Thank you so much for your incredible

539
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:14,390
contribution. When grass is green as day, grass orange dusk. No color is night, okay? Sorry,

540
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:19,800
I'm still good to go. I knew it was going to happen too. And now this is where it gets fucking

541
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:54,119
loud. And I've got the kryptonite on too. Is there a mushroom down here? Apparently there's

542
01:32:54,119 --> 01:33:14,779
a mushroom down here somewhere. Orange, orange, orange. Time to go. I forget where the house is.

543
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:37,300
Oh no. Where's the house? I'm going to be honest. I'm too afraid to do anything.

544
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:45,770
I'm too afraid to fucking do anything. I'm just going to wait till it's orange. I thought that

545
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:54,300
around here. I thought it was orange. Barricade. I don't have any planks.

546
01:33:54,939 --> 01:34:05,369
It's a very quick cue. You have right to be antsy. Get wood to barricade.

547
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:14,069
There's a storm outside. That's not smart. But where do you get wood?

548
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:25,770
It's not just from the simply like the trees, right? You just have to find it. This adult is

549
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:32,170
scared of thunder. No, this adult is scared of loud ass noises that go in both ears at the same

550
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:37,539
time while he's doing kryptonite to himself. Guys, I don't even listen to music in the car.

551
01:34:42,619 --> 01:34:49,270
I need my ears to see. Somebody, there's a scientific reason for it. I don't know what

552
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:58,970
it's called. I swear to God, this is not a joke. I need my ears to be aware of where I am and shit.

553
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:14,899
I swear to God. What is it called? Ecto, echolocation. I really think I have that.

554
01:35:15,699 --> 01:35:20,979
Because when my ears are blocked, it's hard for me to pay attention and see and stuff.

555
01:35:20,979 --> 01:35:26,899
I think I use echolocation like a bat. It's weird because when I scream really loud,

556
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:39,619
I can see better. It's weird. It's dark out now. All right, I gotta turn it on, right? I'm done.

557
01:35:39,619 --> 01:35:48,409
I don't fucking know, guys. Orange means almost night, right? I'm just trying to learn. Orange

558
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:55,800
means it's almost nighttime. So when it's orange, that's when it's like get the fuck inside.

559
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:01,640
Get inside now, please. And then once this, this is a, it's like a green light, yellow light,

560
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:12,170
and then red light. Now I know. Just needed to learn. You wasted an entire day. Congrats.

561
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:19,529
Every single day it gets harder. You might need to restart. Wait, what do you mean every,

562
01:36:19,529 --> 01:36:24,010
every day it gets harder? Did I just really waste a whole, what did I do today? I don't know.

563
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:31,800
Whatever. Does it really just get harder every day? I'm just waiting to turn on the generator.

564
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:45,210
What was that sound? Is what I want to know. Don't let the chat backseat you. That's okay,

565
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:49,130
though, because I have no idea what I'm doing. And this is a game that doesn't hold your hand.

566
01:36:52,680 --> 01:37:01,460
I'm just trying to see just, okay, so this is how long it takes. All right, turn on the generator.

567
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:07,850
Not yet. Turn it on. Not yet, but it's still orange. Actually, it's becoming not orange.

568
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:14,329
Okay, I'm gonna turn it on now. Okay, now I'll turn it on because it's becoming faded.

569
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:33,420
Where's the light? Was that light? Okay, just stand next to this all day. What a waste of time.

570
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:47,829
So if I just lock myself in the corner with the light facing out, I'm safe. Close the doors. The

571
01:37:47,829 --> 01:38:01,140
doors are closed. Close the doors. I don't know where they are. Which door is open? I'm terrified

572
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:22,069
to go over here. Oven. Is that a person? I'm closing that. Just stand over here. This should

573
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:47,260
be fine. This is how you die. This is not fine. How do you escape now? I'm not trying to escape

574
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:56,949
right now. I'm trying to... Guys, I didn't even have a weapon until 15 minutes ago. I was being

575
01:38:56,949 --> 01:39:19,000
attacked by dogs and shit. Turn off the lamp. You won't ever tell me I won't do something.

576
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:43,300
Five seconds. One, two, three, four, five. Turn off the lamp in 10 seconds.

577
01:39:44,180 --> 01:40:01,779
No. Something's coming. No. Something's over here. Don't move. Is there a crouch? There's something

578
01:40:01,779 --> 01:40:16,779
out here. Walking around. What does that mean? Does that mean they're near here? Oh god. This is

579
01:40:16,779 --> 01:40:37,399
not good. Something is lurking in the shadow. I should stay close to the light. I'm... I'm standing

580
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:41,670
right next to the light. Oh, they're in the house now. They're in the house. The ghosts are in the

581
01:40:41,670 --> 01:41:07,369
house. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why is it not? What happened? Why did that happen? What is that?

582
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:40,060
What happened? A man roughly my size is standing before me. I can barely make out his disturbingly

583
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:45,420
familiar features through the mat visor of his helmet. The massive helmet is covered with an

584
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:53,829
old sack and seems to be an integral part of the unnaturally pale body. I remember him. He's the

585
01:41:53,829 --> 01:42:00,600
one who rescued me from the doctor's house. The man reaches out to me with his black hand.

586
01:42:01,479 --> 01:42:06,920
It's covered in charcoal. There's something written on his worn woolen glove. We need to stick

587
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:12,779
together, brother. His lips are moving, but all the sounds are drowned inside the helmet.

588
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:17,100
He shrugs and takes the huge sack off his back and drops it on the ground, revealing its contents.

589
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:24,329
Go to the road. He wipes his left glove on his pants, takes out the charcoal from his pocket,

590
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:29,609
and starts scribbling. When he finishes, he lifts his dirty hand. All roads lead deeper into the

591
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:56,859
woods. He's got a lot of boards. What are you guys linking? What is this? He stole the gun.

592
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:11,899
It looks... I mean, it looks like... No, guys, this is... I'm telling you. Let me tell you something.

593
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:20,920
I'll show you. This is the kind of internal reaction you have when you realize

594
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:29,050
that the movie you're watching with your parents, you get to the scene that has the

595
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:44,439
pornography in it. This is what you're thinking internally, and my face game is what you're

596
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:47,640
actually presenting to everybody in the family that's sitting there watching.

597
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:09,000
That looks fucking like 100 years old. I gotta stop moving my skin, because

598
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:16,060
when I sit here like this, I could be 20. Anytime I make any emotion, I turn 40.

599
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:35,079
Thanks for that, by the way. All right, let me keep going. So this is me. I just died, right? So

600
01:44:35,079 --> 01:44:41,750
this is me with the... I got, like, oven mitts on or something. I got a bolt handle. Hold still so

601
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:49,060
they don't see your age. Yeah, it's a weird superpower. Then when I stand still, I de-age

602
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:55,560
by like 10 years. I could be 20. What an eagle maniac. I'm fine. All right, I still have...

603
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:01,369
What happens here? So I have no money. I guess... Whatever. I can't do anything.

604
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:05,850
All right, now I'm gonna prepare completely, because now I understand the game. I still have

605
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:11,369
my board. Gonna get boards. What's in here? I've got gasoline. How much gasoline do I have?

606
01:45:12,489 --> 01:45:20,220
I gotta go find boards. I got a plank. I can hit stuff. I'm ready. How much gas do I have? Plenty.

607
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:28,420
Just totally plenty. All right, let's go. The lighting's weird in your room. If you fix it,

608
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:39,000
you might look younger. I gotta turn off the generator. All right, it's daytime. We're good.

609
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,640
Now I understand how the day and night cycle works. I'm gonna bring a little bit of food. I'm

610
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:48,840
gonna bring just some bandages. I'm gonna go scavenging to get boards to put all over the

611
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:57,399
place. All right, store this shit. I can... I'm gonna take this. I'm gonna bring out...

612
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:06,949
Fuck, I don't know. Heal? Is this a pill? I'm always afraid to make mistakes in these games.

613
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:18,920
I need a bandage. I need two rags. Prioritize the bedroom. I will try. All right, I'm just gonna...

614
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:24,020
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm going for it. Let's go. I have to just get stuff. Prioritize the...

615
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:28,579
What's the bedroom? All these rooms are all fucked up. Which one is the bedroom? I have no idea.

616
01:46:28,579 --> 01:46:39,050
That one? Okay, let's go. The one with the bed. Okay, I'm going for it. Let's go. I got a plank.

617
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:44,390
I've got... I'm ready to defend myself. What do we got? I'm gonna check out this burned house.

618
01:46:52,979 --> 01:47:01,130
There we go. All right. Broken glass. Let's get it. I don't... Maybe I can use it for something.

619
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:06,140
It's a trap. All right, nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Let's go.

620
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:13,989
Got plenty of daylight. Burned house. I got my plank. I can hit the random things that attack me.

621
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:29,100
All right, like that. Like right now. I'm ready. Two dogs. Four dogs. Is that too many?

622
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:42,710
There might be six. There's a six dog. There's a camp over here. I have to do this. Uh-oh. What

623
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:51,289
the fuck was that? It's the... I didn't... Okay, that's what it looks like. God damn it. I didn't...

624
01:47:51,289 --> 01:48:04,250
I couldn't even fucking tell. I need to check in here. Can they see me?

625
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:13,659
Oh no, I'm gonna die again. There's like seven of them. Get out of here. Wait.

626
01:48:13,659 --> 01:48:20,140
Wait. No, no, no. Give me the meat, meat, meat, meat, meat. Hurry up. Get in your fucking

627
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:29,539
inventory. Hurry up. Ah! How do I throw it down? How do I give them the meat? How do I give them

628
01:48:29,539 --> 01:48:45,319
the meat? Okay, no. I have the meat. That's why they're coming over here. Oh my God. It's not

629
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:52,310
gonna work out. Throw the meat. I was trying to. Does it hold right? How do you throw this shit on

630
01:48:52,310 --> 01:49:08,220
the ground? What the hell am I doing? You have to hold it for like two or three seconds.

631
01:49:08,859 --> 01:49:18,859
To put it in your fucking hand, you have to go... All right, I don't know what the hell I'm

632
01:49:18,859 --> 01:49:26,489
supposed to be doing here. Trying to find wood, but apparently this is the dogpocalypse.

633
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:33,560
It's all dogs. It's only dogs. The animals took over.

634
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:44,500
I gotta go a different way. Don't step on these poisonous mushrooms.

635
01:49:53,899 --> 01:50:12,180
No weapon. I got a weapon. I need to heal though. I need logs. You would think that logs would be

636
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:19,130
the easiest thing in the whole game to find. There's trees everywhere. Why is it like finding

637
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:52,039
ammo in Resident Evil? How come I've not seen any logs? Can I get a log? Okay, there's a tree.

638
01:50:52,920 --> 01:51:22,579
A fallen tree. Its bark looks chewed up. Hit it. That's not doing anything. Okay, I'm gonna...

639
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:38,569
That's not a log. This is like a chest. There's treasure chests lying around, but no logs. Did I

640
01:51:38,569 --> 01:52:07,560
get like a shitty seed? There's more bear traps than logs. Oh my God, finally. Wooden logs.

641
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:37,880
That's it? Thank God, finally. Stumps. Stone too. All right, so I got... Getting there.

642
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:51,050
Okay, how many logs do I need to make enough planks to survive? I have six. Did I miss a pile?

643
01:52:51,609 --> 01:53:11,109
There we go. All right, I'm fucking off. I'm out of here. I'm over here at the log pile.

644
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:25,800
Over at the hideout. Let's go. Trap. I missed... What do you mean the biggest pile? I missed a pile?

645
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:38,340
How did I do that? This one right here? That's not... Oh, I thought... I didn't think this was...

646
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:53,050
I thought they had to be the little like rabbit pellets. Okay, I'm good. Wait, chest. I need to...

647
01:53:53,050 --> 01:54:05,689
Okay, let's get me out of here. There's a lot of these random crates. So now I board up with the

648
01:54:05,689 --> 01:54:18,869
windows and then make sure that I have light in the bedroom. More piles. Thank God. This is just a

649
01:54:18,869 --> 01:54:35,739
wood. This is just... We're getting as much wood as I can carry. I got no more room. I gotta go.

650
01:54:35,739 --> 01:54:42,979
What is this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I hear a dog somewhere. I know. I gotta

651
01:54:42,979 --> 01:54:46,739
kill it. I gotta kill this dog. I'm gonna kill the dog. There's only one dog, right? Kill it.

652
01:54:49,939 --> 01:54:55,220
There's only one dog. Kill it, I guess. Don't... I had one here. I fucking missed.

653
01:54:55,939 --> 01:55:14,250
All right, I'll give it here. Give me the dog's ear. What happened to it? I had to do that. There's

654
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:26,619
nothing else I could do. Where the hell am I? I don't... I think I'm going the wrong way. Okay,

655
01:55:26,619 --> 01:55:44,229
up, up, up from here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not right now. All right, we're here.

656
01:55:50,619 --> 01:56:02,890
All right, so now get in here. Thank God. I have nothing to cook, right? No mushrooms. Turn the logs

657
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:25,449
into planks. So, wood logs to planks. 25 fuel. How many should I do? Is that a good idea? All of

658
01:56:25,449 --> 01:56:53,819
them. I... Okay, I have 16 planks. Okay, now windows first, right? Which windows? Bedroom windows

659
01:56:54,220 --> 01:57:20,649
first. Window. Bingo. Barricade. I need... Let's go. This one, too. And then this one.

660
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:33,000
Good. What's that? All right, let's just throw up in my mouth. I don't know why I told you that.

661
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:54,260
Should I very... No. Corner of the bedroom. I don't know, there's a backpack back here.

662
01:57:54,979 --> 01:58:03,100
Can you honk in this game? That'd be awesome if you could. Okay, so this is fine.

663
01:58:03,979 --> 01:58:24,579
Now I need to do that. What about over here? Is this okay? Is that blocking that? Push the furniture

664
01:58:24,579 --> 01:58:30,760
in front of the door. All right, barricaded window. That's barricaded. So, this has to stay here,

665
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:40,619
though, because look, I mean, is that blocking this? Can I get confirmed? Am I now safe? Okay,

666
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:51,619
so they can't get in now. Door. Close the doors. Lock up. The only way you can get in is from here,

667
01:58:51,619 --> 01:59:00,140
but should I... I'm just gonna barricade this door. Put the stool in front of the door. Yeah,

668
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:13,210
so that's blocking that door. I don't think I have any more furniture. Can I make furniture?

669
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:41,180
Okay. Drop your traps. Do I have traps on me? Oh, okay. Trap. Broken glass. Where should I put it?

670
01:59:41,819 --> 01:59:46,439
In front of... In front of a window? In front of one of the doors?

671
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:53,750
Should I put it, like, over here? Right in front of the front door.

672
01:59:54,069 --> 02:00:30,390
What? Outside the front door. It's, like, here. Like... Wait, am I gonna step on this? Oh, shit,

673
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:52,229
the well. I need... Oh, shit. Um, I need gasoline. Where's my gas? Give me my gas. I can remake this.

674
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:16,229
Okay, give me the gas on this hot bar here. Make some more wood. Here we go. Okay. What does the

675
02:01:18,779 --> 02:01:31,989
well do for me? Give me fresh water? Okay, so... Oh, nice. Okay, so I can heal.

676
02:01:32,789 --> 02:01:45,140
Is this infinite? Okay, I can hold... I can keep these in here. Now let's put the glass down

677
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:53,130
once per day. That's useful. Okay, so, um, I'm gonna close it. Put it here and then close the door.

678
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:09,479
No, they can't get in. It's orange. All right. Did I do it... Did I do this right?

679
02:02:09,479 --> 02:02:13,319
Oh, wait, wait. I have to... I have to turn the, uh... I have to turn the generator on right now.

680
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:20,710
I didn't turn the generator on. Where's the light? Where's the lamp? Does it... Okay,

681
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:39,270
this is... Turn it on. Okay, there's plenty of gas. We're fine. Did you just write GTA 2 is lame?

682
02:02:39,909 --> 02:02:51,819
What does that have to do with anything? Okay, this is blocked. I think I'm safe now. I'm safe,

683
02:02:51,819 --> 02:03:02,489
I think. I should be. I gotta take my plank out just in case somebody gets in here.

684
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:14,949
And the torch. All right, I'm ready for a fight. Bring the other light in. What do you mean the

685
02:03:14,949 --> 02:03:36,039
other light? There's another light? Put two lamps in the bedroom. Um, okay, here we go. It's

686
02:03:36,039 --> 02:03:49,109
happening. It's happening right now. So I gotta put all the lights in the bedroom. So I'm going.

687
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:53,779
I'm going. I'm going. I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving. All right, everything's barricaded. I've

688
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:58,420
got two lamps. I've got the generator running and I have my... I've got traps outside the front door.

689
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:17,270
I've got everything boarded up. One guy. You don't have a roof. There's no roofs in this game.

690
02:04:18,149 --> 02:04:30,819
Close the door. All right, they can't get in any other way, right? Let's board it up.

691
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:38,729
It's all boarded up. All right, I'm ready. Barricade the door now.

692
02:04:40,140 --> 02:05:04,619
Yeah. Should I not have that? I'm just locking myself in the bedroom completely. Now I'm trapped.

693
02:05:04,619 --> 02:05:19,640
Put the lamp on the door. It's... I can dismantle it. It's okay. All right. Um, should be fine.

694
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:32,069
What? Now what do I have to do? I still need to go over to like the secret silent forest.

695
02:05:32,789 --> 02:05:48,170
Okay, I can do it. Don't stand near the windows. I can hear something skittering around.

696
02:06:14,329 --> 02:06:36,500
What if I don't don't stand at the door either? I'm good. I'm good. They can't get over here.

697
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:49,979
They don't even know I'm in here. It's all barricaded up. Well, what's that thing? Why is

698
02:06:49,979 --> 02:06:55,590
there a demon in here? Why is there a demon in here? What do I do? What do I do about that? What

699
02:06:55,590 --> 02:07:31,800
do I do? Touch it? I picked it up. What does it do? Eat it. Um, okay. I ate it. I gave it a heal,

700
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:38,489
apparently. Why somebody just said eat it and I just reflect it. I just don't know what to look

701
02:07:38,489 --> 02:08:12,649
at in the chat. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here come the ghosts. Are they going to turn

702
02:08:12,649 --> 02:08:18,659
off both lamps? I got to move the lamp. I have to move the lamp out of the room. Yep. They turned

703
02:08:18,659 --> 02:08:27,029
up that lamp. It's okay. They can't get in here though, right? Ghosts can move through walls.

704
02:08:30,789 --> 02:08:36,149
Ghosts can move through walls. How do I combat a ghost moving through a fucking wall? How do I?

705
02:08:36,949 --> 02:08:56,420
I'm good. They can't move through the walls. Things you can't kill are afraid of the light

706
02:08:56,420 --> 02:09:17,689
usually. I made it. Correct. Turn both lamps off. Okay. I almost just died from this.

707
02:09:29,989 --> 02:09:38,630
Day four? I thought it was day two. I thought it was day two. Is it day four? When did it become

708
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:58,340
day four? Let's turn the generator off. I have to get out of the room. Um, where's my bed? It's

709
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:03,609
right here. All right. I got some time here. Uh, trader is back. I got a hundred trader reputation

710
02:10:03,609 --> 02:10:11,020
gold. I noticed a smile on his face through the mat visor of his helmet. The man nods in greeting.

711
02:10:11,659 --> 02:10:23,289
Show item. Okay. Trade. Wish I had whatever the hell that demon dropped. That'd be nice.

712
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:45,510
Axe blade. I don't have any money. I got, I stopped biting your lip. That's bad habit. Um,

713
02:10:46,390 --> 02:11:05,590
I could get gas. Save it for the watch. Yeah, that is useful. Shotgun. I feel like the,

714
02:11:06,310 --> 02:11:09,350
maybe later on when you survive one night, so you get more money or something, but

715
02:11:10,409 --> 02:11:17,989
I can barely walk around with a stick with nails on it. Get some wires. I think I have some wires,

716
02:11:17,989 --> 02:11:30,539
don't I? I gotta move this though so I can turn off the generator. Better off finding stuff. Yeah,

717
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:45,770
I got plenty of gas. All right. Move this back. Maybe too far. You're right here.

718
02:11:45,770 --> 02:12:03,020
All right. Up and work bench board with nails torch. I still have a little bit of torch left.

719
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:15,380
All right. What the hell? Just dump all this in here. Okay. Lock pick. I do need the wire.

720
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:20,659
No, that's no, that's a different kind of like curly squiggly thing. That's rope and that's

721
02:12:20,659 --> 02:12:33,609
wire. I need to wire the nails in there too. Upgrade the work bench. Oh shit. I'll be able

722
02:12:33,609 --> 02:12:37,050
to craft more items and fit more upgrades into weapons when I upgrade my work bench.

723
02:12:38,010 --> 02:13:05,350
Oh, let's do it. Okay. Ooh, I need a barrel. Lantern. How long does it last?

724
02:13:11,289 --> 02:13:21,560
Waiting to see the final time on the speed run. Probably 16 hours and 42 minutes.

725
02:13:24,630 --> 02:13:32,630
Should I just buy these? I think I'm going to buy two of them, but I need,

726
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:43,619
I'll go look for them. I mean, I'm going to, I've got, I'm going to go explore.

727
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:53,899
I'm going to bring some meat with me. I think I have a couple of pieces, right? Yeah.

728
02:13:54,859 --> 02:14:00,939
Bring this. I have a bandage. I have, I don't think I can think of pills too, don't I?

729
02:14:03,079 --> 02:14:15,460
Rag and alcohol. Can I make, how do I make a rag to go off? Right. I'm just going to go.

730
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:25,220
I'm going to go, I need to go like down here. Or no, I, the underground, it's been like two

731
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:28,659
and a half hours. I was supposed to go this way. Underground entrance. What am I, I have to go in

732
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:47,560
the underground entrance. I forgot that was part of the, all right, let's go. All right. Here we go.

733
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:54,579
Underground entrance. This loud rain. I, sorry, I can't hear you. Already there's a dog.

734
02:14:55,060 --> 02:15:05,750
I want nothing to do with this dog. I could buy a shotgun. I can only shoot it one time, which I

735
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:22,470
will miss. I won't hit the thing I'm aiming at and it'll be a waste of money. There's that hole.

736
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:45,399
It's in here. Wait, how do I get in here? Climb the window, right? Get in the underground lair.

737
02:15:46,359 --> 02:16:04,500
I hear mushroom noises. Here we go. I actually do not remember what I was supposed to do down

738
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:14,810
here, but I'm just going to go down here. I guess this is go through the underground passage. This

739
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:19,609
is the blood more. This is the fine, the den of evil of this game. And I've just barely doing it

740
02:16:19,609 --> 02:16:37,079
now. Motorcycle magazine, automotive magazine. Okay. Maybe I can sell it. I needed another torch.

741
02:16:37,879 --> 02:16:48,899
It's all right. There's no map down here either. What was that? Is it a dog? Of course it is.

742
02:16:48,899 --> 02:17:30,809
Dogs everywhere. What is that? There's like a light over here. Mushroom. This part of the

743
02:17:30,809 --> 02:17:47,799
passage is blocked by overgrown roots. Smash it. There's going to be like a sacrificial

744
02:17:47,799 --> 02:18:00,010
fucking circle over here. It's my only way out. I won't be able to open it without my key.

745
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:05,750
Look at the handle. Press your ear against the keyhole. The hatch handle is covered in a thick

746
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:13,030
layer of dust. It hasn't been open for at least two weeks. I can hear a faint voice throughout

747
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:16,389
the howling wind. It sounds familiar. It seems to be coming through the keyhole. Someone's calling

748
02:18:16,389 --> 02:18:23,430
me. The hatch handle is covered in a thick layer of dust. It hasn't been open for at least two

749
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:49,909
weeks. Look through the keyhole. I don't have a key. Is this the way I leave the game? This

750
02:18:49,909 --> 02:18:57,020
is how you actually win. Interesting. Okay. Well, I'm on my way back, which means that I'm going to

751
02:18:57,979 --> 02:19:03,129
I knew it. I knew it. I'm just going to run. I think I'm going to run. I think I'm just going to run.

752
02:19:04,709 --> 02:19:09,350
Ah, I was down and then left. There's going to be a monster here or something. I don't know. I only

753
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:34,219
have a little bit more of my torch. Oh god. They are so powerful. Run. Just run, run, run, run, run,

754
02:19:34,219 --> 02:19:59,239
run, run, run. Jesus. Oh, it's getting dark. It's getting dark outside. It's night. It's

755
02:19:59,239 --> 02:20:18,979
nighttime now. I think it's nighttime right now. Is it nighttime right now? Oh, I do have mushrooms

756
02:20:18,979 --> 02:20:54,889
to deposit. Oh god. What is this little dog? All right. I'm good. I'm good. A minute, a minute. Nice.

757
02:20:55,850 --> 02:21:09,049
Okay. Let's put these mushrooms in. I don't even know what I need. Let's see. 10 essence, 10, 10.

758
02:21:09,049 --> 02:21:20,680
Okay. Not bad. So I can't actually go down there yet, but I can make another board with nails.

759
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:31,829
What a repair item is what? It's four. Okay. It's one and five. To make a new one, it's two and ten.

760
02:21:31,829 --> 02:21:35,819
So you just want to keep this repaired. I don't think I need to do that yet though.

761
02:21:43,159 --> 02:21:49,239
Okay. I've got a battery, some more planks, some meat in there. All right. Looks good.

762
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:55,829
I just want to let you know that you're doing great. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that.

763
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:12,569
Can I make another lamp? This is a, somebody said this is a useless emote, the new one. I know.

764
02:22:13,450 --> 02:22:16,170
I think the only reason why that's serious is because I didn't want to do a 24-hour stream.

765
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:20,329
It's last night I said, last night, sorry, what I meant to say was three days ago.

766
02:22:21,209 --> 02:22:24,809
I said if I didn't have that here by the next stream, then I would have to do a 24-hour stream.

767
02:22:24,809 --> 02:22:33,000
So I only did it so I didn't have to do that. All right. Now what? I think now I just have to

768
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:54,600
chill. The generator is not on. It's not dying time at all. You have time? Okay. Yeah. It's just

769
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:59,750
the rain. All right. I'm going to go down to the lower right just for a little bit and see if I

770
02:22:59,750 --> 02:23:31,940
can grab any new supplies. Find a new place. What's this? A farm? Farmland? A wedding?

771
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:47,590
Wedding. It's just like a maze. Don't fucking be an idiot here.

772
02:23:58,219 --> 02:24:17,379
What is over here? Oh shit, there's a place. Okay. Oh fuck.

773
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:24,440
Is it just one dog? Oh, it's a dog. Okay. That dog can't hurt me.

774
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:37,989
There's going to be gas in here, right? No gas or anything on the car? Nothing here? No way.

775
02:24:44,729 --> 02:24:54,219
I have to do this quick. I have...

776
02:24:57,989 --> 02:25:01,110
I had... I had to. I'm sorry. I had to do that. Otherwise it would kill me.

777
02:25:04,149 --> 02:25:24,600
What's on the table? What is that? Nothing? What is going on in here? The torch... an old wagon

778
02:25:25,239 --> 02:25:31,500
decorated with coked ribs and flowers made of white tissue paper. All right. I gotta go.

779
02:25:35,299 --> 02:25:41,020
Chair. No. Come on. Like a box or something in here. Anything.

780
02:25:44,579 --> 02:25:56,219
Food. Anything. A box. Stop. What do you mean stop? Stop, stop, stop, stop. I have to leave.

781
02:25:56,219 --> 02:26:00,629
I have to leave. I have to get out of here now. Oh my god. Oh my god. What's happening?

782
02:26:00,629 --> 02:26:07,110
What the fuck is that? It's orange, right? I gotta go. I'll come back here another time.

783
02:26:07,829 --> 02:26:31,049
It's not orange yet. I wish I had a torch. Something's banging. Combo to get in there.

784
02:26:31,850 --> 02:27:06,360
What is with this placement of barrels? I'm gonna get stuck in here and it's gonna be really bad.

785
02:27:10,149 --> 02:27:13,909
Yeah. I'm like getting stuck in here. I can't get stuck in this shit right now.

786
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:21,379
I'm stuck in here now. Fantastic. I don't even know how I got in here.

787
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:34,059
Destroyed well. Good. I got one piece of rope. Awesome. Excellent. I'm surprised there's nothing

788
02:27:34,059 --> 02:27:58,709
else in here. I can't. There's no... I need a combination to get over there.

789
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:12,940
I need a combination to get over here or in light. What the fuck was that? I just can't see

790
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:30,889
anything. Can you tell me there's nothing in the dog house? Wait. No. More of these random logs

791
02:28:30,889 --> 02:28:43,020
in the way. Is there a faster way to get out of this? Put me down here. I'm just gonna go up

792
02:28:43,020 --> 02:29:00,280
to the right. No. Do I actually... I have to go through this again. How do I get out? I do not

793
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:23,180
I do not remember how I got in here. I think it was from up. Oh no. This way. Oh you motherfucker.

794
02:29:23,899 --> 02:29:41,139
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm fine. Top left. Just move this way. A bunch of dogs.

795
02:29:41,940 --> 02:30:01,860
Turn on the generator. Stamina. Get it back. Come on. Thank you for clapping for me. I'm here.

796
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:09,979
All right. I'm good. I didn't learn anything new. I didn't get anything new. I guess just survive

797
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:21,659
again and run this way tomorrow. I guess. I got rope. That's not gonna do shit for me.

798
02:30:22,379 --> 02:30:41,340
How do I get back in my fucking house? Wait. Mushroom remains. Somebody's in your room.

799
02:30:42,059 --> 02:30:46,680
You mean in the video game room or in like the actual room? Because I'm too scared to turn around.

800
02:30:51,350 --> 02:31:03,659
I have to turn on the generator. Not quite yet though. It's still all right. All right.

801
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:17,659
Everything's still barricaded. I'm gonna. I'm gonna repair this.

802
02:31:18,459 --> 02:31:34,069
Just so it's. Why is it red now? Okay. This is fine. This is fine. I can drink from the well tomorrow.

803
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:52,649
Uh doorway. Repair the doorway. Wait. Somebody got in here? That's not good. Was it always broken?

804
02:31:52,649 --> 02:32:01,420
Oh. I think I'm all right then. All right. We're getting to be close to night time here.

805
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:08,549
Is there anything else I can do? All right. So the goal. Goal for tomorrow is to go down here.

806
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:12,489
Try to make at least somewhat of progress going down this way.

807
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:42,780
Right. I need lock picks too but I can't find any wiring. Turn off the lights and play in the dark.

808
02:32:44,379 --> 02:32:50,600
It's 4 30 in the afternoon in Las Vegas. I can. It's. That's not going to work.

809
02:32:51,239 --> 02:32:57,670
You're gonna have to wait another couple hours. I have no more gas either.

810
02:32:58,389 --> 02:33:03,020
I actually really don't like this. What's happening right now because I don't have

811
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:10,100
any more gas. Close my blinds. They're. They're closed already. The sun is huge out here.

812
02:33:10,819 --> 02:33:14,180
You're way close to the sun. To those who don't know Las Vegas is in the mountains.

813
02:33:14,180 --> 02:33:17,700
So it's like 4 000 feet elevated closer to the sun. That's why it looks bigger.

814
02:33:18,579 --> 02:33:33,930
That's why it's harder. Nothing else. Not one of these mazes. Something small I can just grab right

815
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:51,270
there. No. It's too risky. It's amazing that literally nothing I just said was correct.

816
02:33:55,260 --> 02:34:09,559
Whatever. There is glass there. All right. I think it's time just to sit and just exist in here and

817
02:34:09,559 --> 02:34:14,700
then I'll have enough money tomorrow. All right. Let's do it. Just turn it on.

818
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:33,770
So I should be able to buy some decent stuff tomorrow. It's in there, right? Yeah. Okay.

819
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:48,680
Live another day. Why are you doing Han Solo? What the hell do you guys know? All right. Bring

820
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:57,479
it on. Let's go. I have to pee too. I have to. I'm gonna take a break after this. He'll pee.

821
02:35:06,059 --> 02:35:14,819
And then grab. I'm so sick of this happening. Again. We're only talking truth on this stream.

822
02:35:14,819 --> 02:35:19,459
Only truth. I've showed this before but like seriously. We're only going to speak truth.

823
02:35:20,020 --> 02:35:29,510
Okay. This is a razor death adder. I've used this mouse for years. I don't. I don't understand.

824
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:36,549
I need to. I needs to be explained. So why this. Why do you have this sticky thing over here that

825
02:35:36,549 --> 02:35:41,219
can come off? Do you see what you see? What's that? I did. This is that's part of the mouse.

826
02:35:42,149 --> 02:35:52,090
This thing is sticky. It's like glued on and it's the grip for the mouse. Why on earth is this

827
02:35:52,090 --> 02:36:08,309
possible? Because now I can't put it back on. Why is this? Why is this like this? Yeah. I've tried

828
02:36:08,309 --> 02:36:14,620
to put this back on like three or four times. You're supposed to buy a new one. This mouse is

829
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:20,860
less than six months old. It's like six or seven months old. Glue it back on but that's the problem.

830
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:25,579
It's never gonna fit the same way because it was like stuffed in and glued in there. I'm not sure

831
02:36:25,579 --> 02:36:34,819
you can see this. It's this thing is bigger than this slot is. It was like stuffed in and glued

832
02:36:34,819 --> 02:36:43,620
inside. Why is there even a grip on this mouse? What's the what does this grip do?

833
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:56,889
What's this grip? What's it here for? I did to grip my mouse? All that happens is you just get this

834
02:36:56,889 --> 02:37:04,420
disgusting brown shit in there. That's it. Just collect it. It's a brown gamer shit collector.

835
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:19,479
I don't understand. And you can't just take it off and now I can't grab this because it's sticky.

836
02:37:19,479 --> 02:37:23,079
Actually maybe that's the point. So now it's a super grip because now I stick to this when I hold

837
02:37:23,079 --> 02:37:33,559
it. Am I alive? I'm still fine, right? I've owned the Death Adder. Different versions of it for like

838
02:37:33,559 --> 02:37:42,280
15 years. Never have I seen the glued on weird grip thing on the edge. All right, I gotta pay

839
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:52,760
attention. I'm just gonna get an Amazon... Who opened that? Did I do that? I did. Did I do that?

840
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:27,530
Why did this open? Put the lamp on the door. Good call. Okay, I feel better now. I've used

841
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:35,750
a generic Microsoft mouse for eight years and I'm just fine. Yeah, I'm just gonna get the $4

842
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:46,139
Amazon mouse. Fake gamer. I use an Amazon keyboard. That thing is fine. It was $8.95.

843
02:38:46,940 --> 02:39:09,590
It wasn't $300. Cheap gamer. My... Guys, we all have the same buttons. I have WASD on my keyboard.

844
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:18,420
So do you. I press W and I go up. You press W you go up too. You don't get extra keys. Maybe

845
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:28,870
some of them do. All the mouse has to do is left and right click with maybe a function button or

846
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:47,530
two like a mini scroll wheel. You don't have any optical buttons. Gamer keys. And when have you

847
02:39:47,530 --> 02:39:53,209
ever used your gamer keys on your special keyboard? Because every time I've had a special keyboard,

848
02:39:53,209 --> 02:40:00,340
they go untouched. In fact, I try to find ways to turn them off because I've never... I don't touch

849
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:05,139
them. Dust actually collected on some of my F keys on some of those like super function keys

850
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:14,100
because I've never touched them once. That's like having the help button on your Dell

851
02:40:14,659 --> 02:40:18,790
keyboard and you would accidentally press it and you'd get the help screen would come up and you'd

852
02:40:18,790 --> 02:40:34,200
be screaming at your monitor. Show us your keyboard. I've seen it before. It's an Amazon Basics.

853
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:43,079
Thing is cheap. But the buttons press and I move. Now if I really wanted to splurge,

854
02:40:43,719 --> 02:40:50,920
you go for that like $29.99. The one that has the thing that stick... It lies down on two little

855
02:40:50,920 --> 02:41:20,899
sticks and goes up at an angle. They didn't even come near me. I'm fine. My gamer keyboard. I want

856
02:41:20,899 --> 02:41:32,090
to go home. Who's this? After you survive night, you gain reputation with the trader. All right,

857
02:41:32,090 --> 02:41:58,809
cool. Who is this? Oops. What the fuck? Why did you do that? It's a... It's a vision. Not even real.

858
02:41:58,809 --> 02:42:06,489
It's just a vision. All right. I have 200 bucks. I need to buy gasoline. I'm sorry, guys. Everyone's

859
02:42:06,489 --> 02:42:11,579
going to be very upset about this, but I have to. I could get a metal pipe and make a gun.

860
02:42:11,579 --> 02:42:34,059
Don't bite your lip. Omega low. Omega low. Why? How much is a watch? 200? 300. I can't. I don't

861
02:42:34,059 --> 02:42:49,639
have enough. I need to live like another day or two. In the meantime... I need a torch. I have to do

862
02:42:49,639 --> 02:43:01,559
one. I need a torch. I'm going to go anywhere. I already have a board with nails. Make torch

863
02:43:01,559 --> 02:43:09,340
and explore that wedding chapel. That's what I was thinking of doing. Sell some stuff. I feel like

864
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:15,049
I need this stuff, though. Tire's not worth anything. Metal scrap I'll probably need. I'll

865
02:43:15,049 --> 02:43:23,909
probably need some of this at some point. At least I think I do. Sell your useless stuff. I don't know

866
02:43:23,909 --> 02:43:36,889
what's useless. Scrap metal. You can't go to the wedding. It's a waste of time. Okay. Well,

867
02:43:36,889 --> 02:43:44,739
that's good to know. Hold on to my... Yeah, I'm going to hold on to this stuff. I'm going to go

868
02:43:44,739 --> 02:43:52,739
explore the place I want to explore. I need healing, though. What can I get? I need two

869
02:43:52,739 --> 02:44:02,579
pieces of cloth. That shouldn't be that hard to find, honestly. I really do need gasoline,

870
02:44:02,579 --> 02:44:14,180
too. Hopefully I can find it. I can dodge by pressing control. Oh, that's really... Okay,

871
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:22,040
that's good to know. General. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I have like one more night in

872
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:27,959
this thing. This is going to be bad, isn't it? All right, I'm going to go down this way. Down.

873
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:46,219
Over and down. I have my torch, right? Get it on the bar. Poison. Don't touch it.

874
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:59,559
Just metal that trap. Get scrap metal. Perfect. Okay. Down. I'm trying to find a way through here.

875
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:08,569
Silent forest. There we go. Logs. Do I need these anymore, though? I feel like I don't even need

876
02:45:08,569 --> 02:45:22,069
these. Do I need this shit? Important message. That was very important. I'm glad everybody just

877
02:45:22,069 --> 02:45:32,940
told me. Very important stuff you guys are putting in the chat. I appreciate it. I just hit the

878
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:38,889
Windows button. Another key that should never exist anymore. There's no reason for that button

879
02:45:38,889 --> 02:45:47,879
to exist. I have this theory that Microsoft... I have this theory, right? Pause the game. I have

880
02:45:47,959 --> 02:45:54,760
theory that the reason why there's a Windows key on every single keyboard is because it's just free

881
02:45:54,760 --> 02:46:00,790
advertisement for Windows. If it's on every single keyboard... Oh, that's the Windows key.

882
02:46:01,510 --> 02:46:05,350
Every single company that makes a keyboard has it there. I'm surprised it's not on Mac keyboards.

883
02:46:06,069 --> 02:46:12,860
Do they have to pay money to license that, by the way? If I want to make a keyboard and I'm going

884
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:18,379
to make the German 985 keyboard and there's a Windows key on it, do I have to pay Microsoft

885
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:25,559
fifteen cents a sale to do that? I'm actually serious. I'm actually asking this as a real

886
02:46:25,559 --> 02:46:38,180
question. I'm not kidding around. Yes, I do. Do I? So why do most companies put it on there? Why

887
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:49,079
not just have a bigger control and a bigger alt? It's copyrighted. Who copyrighted the keyboard?

888
02:46:49,639 --> 02:46:59,430
That's an important function. No, it's not. There's no keyboard copyright. You don't have to pay

889
02:46:59,430 --> 02:47:04,469
anybody. Is there somebody that invented the keyboard like 40 years ago? And now you have to...

890
02:47:06,739 --> 02:47:16,780
two-year Pepe dance. What? All right, I gotta go. Silent Forest looks like it's this way, but

891
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:23,430
I'm gonna move over here. This looks like the entrance to the Silent Forest if I was an entrance

892
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:36,760
to a forest that was supposed to be the entrance to this. There it is. All right, we got some

893
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:56,870
potential room here. There's a spot over here. Window? No. Fucking demons here or anything.

894
02:48:01,139 --> 02:48:18,069
Stop singing. What are we doing? I need a... All right. Generator. Switch it on.

895
02:48:34,389 --> 02:48:39,430
What is in there? How much gas is in this? Last one just for the visual.

896
02:48:40,469 --> 02:49:18,180
Who is saying huh? Really? Every door has a lock? What is that? Hole. This place is infected with

897
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:29,989
something toxic. I need to find a way to get rid of it. I don't know. Burn? Burn it.

898
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:53,139
Burn it. Molotov cocktail. Okay, I gotta get this right. I only have one. Can I do it? Okay.

899
02:49:55,379 --> 02:50:04,149
What about over here? I guess I can still take this stuff. Oven. Nothing in the oven?

900
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:16,620
All right, there's somebody in here. I heard him. Oh, come on. There's another one. How do I make a

901
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:48,360
Molotov cocktail? Wait. Are you serious? That's annoying. Okay. Further in? There's a guy in here.

902
02:50:48,920 --> 02:51:15,850
I heard him. It's a bathtub. What's that? Egg. Something is floating inside. The skin looks to

903
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:26,860
be quite thin. Maybe I could puncture it or pierce it with something. An embryo. Get rid of something.

904
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:30,280
Get rid of something. Get rid of something. Get rid of something. What do I get rid of? I don't

905
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:47,909
know what to get rid of. I can't make the stone. And I'm gonna make a bandage. You fucking idiot.

906
02:51:47,909 --> 02:52:13,159
You imbecile. Two bandages. Uh, no. Um, the rag? The meat. Give me that egg. I got it. Okay.

907
02:52:13,159 --> 02:52:22,870
What? Bathtub. Search the bathtub. All right. I'm getting into uncharted territory here. There's

908
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:34,090
somebody. I heard the noise of somebody gurgling and stuff. Nothing else over here. Don't die in

909
02:52:34,090 --> 02:53:01,610
here. Who's gonna be in this bedroom? Why is it so dark over here? What's that? There's a guy. Yeah,

910
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:40,620
there's somebody right there. The person. I just like had to press the number one and I just panicked

911
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:49,340
to a point where I could hit three times. Oh god damn it. I didn't even know what it was. I thought

912
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:54,059
it was going to be just a regular person. It was one of those guys with the giant spear halberds

913
02:53:56,469 --> 02:54:02,489
and you have to hit them like seven times for them to die. I tried to press one, but I pressed the

914
02:54:02,489 --> 02:54:06,870
tilde key, which by the way, why is that on a keyboard? I'm going to make a new, I'm going to

915
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:13,670
make a keyboard where all this useless shit is not on here. You know what I'm saying? I'm getting rid

916
02:54:13,670 --> 02:54:20,069
of the tilde key. I'm getting rid of the windows key. I'm getting rid of whatever this is. What is

917
02:54:20,069 --> 02:54:26,899
this? What is this like filing cabinet down here? Do you see this? What's the filing cabinet button

918
02:54:27,459 --> 02:54:36,950
next to the alt key? What is that? What is this? What's that for? Page up, page down, you're out.

919
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:46,329
Scroll lock, pause, break. The music button. They're all gone. All of them. There's a music

920
02:54:46,329 --> 02:54:56,280
button on here. I want a, I want a minimal keyboard with just the shit that you know you use.

921
02:54:56,280 --> 02:55:03,770
Why can't I, why does it exist? The filing cabinet button opens the right click menu.

922
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:25,479
Why do I have a mouse? I want it to right click menu. Tiny, it's going to be a tiny little keyboard.

923
02:55:25,479 --> 02:55:32,840
No, it'll just be all the QWERTY, all the numbers, all the function keys are gone, by the way.

924
02:55:34,010 --> 02:55:40,860
No windows key. Tab can stay because it's useful. Caps lock can stay. All this like home, end,

925
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:49,819
insert. Just, I just need one, the delete key needs can be this big and sit right there. And

926
02:55:49,819 --> 02:55:54,700
you know what else I don't like? The FN key is like a double function key. Nobody uses that many

927
02:55:54,700 --> 02:56:02,979
keys. I can't think of any person I've ever come across my, hold on, I'm burning daylight here.

928
02:56:02,979 --> 02:56:06,899
I can't think of one person I've ever come across in my entire life. And I mean my whole life

929
02:56:06,899 --> 02:56:17,750
that has ever pressed the FN and a function key in my entire life. Even IT people. FN function,

930
02:56:17,750 --> 02:56:24,620
for what? What do you use it for? What's it for? I want to see at least two or three different

931
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:34,600
scenarios where it's useful. For your volume. I want you to just, volume. So you, hold on,

932
02:56:34,600 --> 02:56:47,739
so you need, you need, you need 24 function keys to raise and lower the volume of your computer.

933
02:56:47,739 --> 02:56:51,260
I can understand. All right. If the tail of the key doesn't exist, that guy's dead.

934
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:58,059
And now I lost the, the fucking, I lost the egg. No, I didn't. Game's actually pretty fun. Never

935
02:56:58,059 --> 02:57:06,549
mind. I was at, I bet, pretend that whole thing didn't happen. FN is for music control. Turn on

936
02:57:06,549 --> 02:57:20,010
the radio. All right. Anyways, they've been making computers, they've been making keyboards

937
02:57:20,010 --> 02:57:28,569
the same fucking way since like 1994. And nobody's decided to, the machines in the factory are set up

938
02:57:28,569 --> 02:57:33,750
to always do it like this. So they're just like, I don't want to change that. I don't want to get

939
02:57:33,750 --> 02:57:39,270
rid of that. It's important for no one. It's, it's for grandma to accidentally press and like

940
02:57:39,270 --> 02:57:46,170
turn her brightness up. All right. I'm done with that. A little bit of an angry. I'm supposed to

941
02:57:46,170 --> 02:57:55,110
pee. Brightness. No, if your screen's too bright, just go to the power options and just drag the bar.

942
02:57:55,829 --> 02:57:59,829
I'm making a keyboard and I'm going to make trillion dollars. It's going to be the trillion

943
02:57:59,829 --> 03:02:02,600
dollar keyboard. All right. I'll be right back. I gotta piss. Seriously, possibly imagine if you

944
03:02:02,600 --> 03:02:07,239
were playing like God of War 2 on your Xbox and you accidentally press the filing cabinet button.

945
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:30,100
What, what's his image? What are you linking? I look like a skeleton. Okay. If you pause at

946
03:02:30,100 --> 03:02:46,500
three seconds, I look like a skeleton. I'm talking about the video, not the stream,

947
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:52,579
the video that just got linked. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Oh, I hate losing.

948
03:02:54,500 --> 03:02:57,299
What a super villain thing to say. I hate to lose.

949
03:02:59,620 --> 03:03:08,170
Okay. Do the thing where some, the cartoon where somebody pulls your tongue out high

950
03:03:08,170 --> 03:03:13,850
bar and lets it go. Wait, what are you talking about? I don't even know what that means. All

951
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:27,260
right. Let's go. Okay. What was I doing? I had this egg. I'm going to store the egg. I don't know

952
03:03:27,260 --> 03:03:35,260
what it's for. I'm going to store this, store this, all of it. I guess if I killed that thing,

953
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:43,219
it would have been good. I need lost inventory. Wait, I can go get my inventory. What was that?

954
03:03:43,780 --> 03:04:00,139
Show him the germ. Show it to him. What do you mean? What do you got? Something here?

955
03:04:00,139 --> 03:04:07,899
What? I saw that. Yeah. I saw it. Yeah. It was me being funny. It was me doing that on purpose.

956
03:04:07,899 --> 03:04:20,440
I was doing like a funny face. You know, I want to like, all right, somebody said cook egg.

957
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:32,549
Are you for real? Does that work? Should I cook egg? Draw my perfect keyboard. I can't

958
03:04:37,139 --> 03:04:48,170
make it. Oh, that's all right. Okay. Cook egg. Oh, 40 essence. Nice. Okay. That's worth a lot.

959
03:04:52,459 --> 03:05:00,629
Now this is a hard game. This is a very hard game. It takes a lot of patience. I

960
03:05:00,629 --> 03:05:05,030
imagine playing this game on nightmare or whatever the hell it is. It's going to rain again.

961
03:05:08,219 --> 03:05:17,340
Should have hatched it. Can you do that? That's weird. All right. I'm going to go.

962
03:05:17,659 --> 03:05:24,889
Oh, where am I going to go? I've been here. I this this wolf's camp I can go up to,

963
03:05:24,889 --> 03:05:32,459
but I'm not like I'm not good enough to go up yet. I need a I need to not panic when I see it's

964
03:05:32,459 --> 03:05:37,799
just that I feel the same way when I ever came across the butcher in Diablo one. I had the same

965
03:05:37,799 --> 03:05:44,040
reaction. Same exact perspective. Same exact scenario. It was around a corner. And he would

966
03:05:44,040 --> 03:05:50,729
just it was terrifying. I couldn't do it. It was scary because you couldn't see. All right.

967
03:05:52,569 --> 03:06:01,260
I don't know what exactly time it is. And I don't have any gasoline. This is the last day

968
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:05,579
that I can do this without needing to forcibly. I need to get gasoline. This is the last night

969
03:06:05,579 --> 03:06:20,329
I can do this. Try try to go get my inventory. I think I'm gonna try to get it. I know that

970
03:06:20,329 --> 03:06:24,250
guy's in there. I just have to dodge and hit him. I'm going for it.

971
03:06:37,719 --> 03:07:04,950
Is my hand slippery and fucking in rain? What is going on? Now, instead of being go find logs

972
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:24,889
for an hour. Now go find rags for an hour. At least there are plenty of those. That's true.

973
03:07:25,530 --> 03:07:33,540
That is correct. You're right. Although this thing's almost broken and it's I need that watch.

974
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:37,750
I would literally sell everything in my inventory tomorrow to get that watch.

975
03:07:38,790 --> 03:07:48,469
I hate not knowing how much time I have. It's killing me. I need to repair this weapon. Don't

976
03:07:48,469 --> 03:08:18,170
step on that glass. Just do it. I need another torch. I wish there was a mode in this game where

977
03:08:18,170 --> 03:08:23,739
there was just a big box that had 10 of every single one of these in them. Just to get you going.

978
03:08:30,709 --> 03:08:44,649
It's getting late. Yeah. But I can't turn the thing on yet. Right when I feel like I'm getting

979
03:08:44,649 --> 03:08:52,979
going, I have to hide in this house and be terrified. I guess that's the point, right?

980
03:08:53,620 --> 03:09:07,159
I need, I'm going to make like four torches or five torches or something. I need alcohol, matches,

981
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:21,579
planks, and rags. Is this going to be enough if I turn it on now? I see a booger. No, you don't.

982
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:42,760
I hope this is enough. Otherwise, I'm dead. Where? What? What are you talking about? Stop.

983
03:09:46,139 --> 03:09:51,930
All right. Pray that this is enough because then I'll have enough money to hopefully buy some stuff.

984
03:09:51,930 --> 03:10:07,530
This is why I can't have face cam. I've told you this a thousand times. B omega booger.

985
03:10:07,530 --> 03:10:19,180
There's a booger on the door behind you. Imagine if I moved out of the way and there was just this

986
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:31,319
six or seven month long booger wall. When I was, it's nighttime, so we had to talk about some of

987
03:10:31,319 --> 03:10:45,829
these things. When I was like, maybe seven or eight years old in my bedroom, you know what's

988
03:10:45,829 --> 03:10:59,879
coming. The wall next to my bedroom, because my bed was right up against the wall, right up against

989
03:10:59,879 --> 03:11:19,049
the wall. But I was, when I was eight, maybe like seven or eight years old, every, every single night

990
03:11:22,069 --> 03:11:33,540
it would go. And I thought I was being so sneaky. We know what it is. I'm not going to say it. I don't

991
03:11:33,540 --> 03:11:42,899
need to, but there would be a collection hidden. And anytime we would rearrange the room,

992
03:11:43,459 --> 03:11:48,500
if my mother wanted to rearrange the beds or, Hey, we're going to change this. So we're going

993
03:11:48,500 --> 03:12:07,510
to change some stuff. What is this? I was like seven. I was, I was a literal child. Okay.

994
03:12:08,389 --> 03:12:32,389
This didn't happen two weeks ago. Seven's too old to be, you puked in your mom's bed two weeks ago,

995
03:12:32,389 --> 03:12:40,709
more like nine years ago. I threw up in my bed. Yeah, but that was like, that was like a decade

996
03:12:40,709 --> 03:12:53,139
old. More than that. That was 10 years ago. You were 25. Yeah. I had to fuck. I puked. I had to

997
03:12:53,139 --> 03:13:01,450
throw up. I was sick. I didn't feel well. What? You've never thrown up before unexpectedly.

998
03:13:06,229 --> 03:13:20,299
This is like red light coming through here right now. How did you get in here? How did he get in

999
03:13:20,299 --> 03:13:33,799
here? How did he get in here? Well, I need this stuff. How did he get in here? Oh, the door.

1000
03:13:50,299 --> 03:14:18,459
I'm going to sneeze. Oh, come on, please close the door. I need to go outside.

1001
03:14:19,420 --> 03:14:28,680
Light will do it. I need to like, look out the window. Come on. Really? You're not going to let

1002
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:34,379
me do this stupid joke that I want to do? Mother nature. Why? I was going to get up and sneeze

1003
03:14:34,379 --> 03:14:48,790
into the wall right here. And well, not anymore, apparently. Quick, do a windows key. No, I got,

1004
03:14:48,790 --> 03:14:58,069
I got seven monitors here. They're all bright. You know, I was trying to think of what I would

1005
03:14:58,069 --> 03:15:06,680
do with like five, six, seven monitors. People have that. I'm trying to think of, okay, if I had

1006
03:15:08,379 --> 03:15:23,219
stream labs, OBS, web browser, game or whatever right here. Chat. What, what, what could you do

1007
03:15:23,219 --> 03:15:36,680
with four monitors? More than four. Look at the five monitors. For what? What would you put on them?

1008
03:15:37,559 --> 03:15:44,680
Put stocks on one. I guess that's true. All right. Well, I did it. Another day. Trade. What do I got?

1009
03:15:44,680 --> 03:15:52,489
300 and I'm going to get the watch. I'm going for it. No, but I need a gasoline.

1010
03:15:53,209 --> 03:16:16,020
Was it 48 watch or gasoline necessity or vanity? No, I don't sell it back to him for 150. Put it

1011
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:25,799
back over here. All right. I need gas though. So let's sell some of these. I'll sell you a,

1012
03:16:26,600 --> 03:16:38,579
hold on. I need 48 time. Eight, eight AM. Now I have that forever, right? And this can't break.

1013
03:16:39,379 --> 03:16:47,459
All right. Does he buy logs? No, I need those logs. He'll buy pills though. Whatever. I don't

1014
03:16:47,459 --> 03:16:55,610
need these for anything. I'm not going to do drugs. That's 30. Maybe some scrap metal. Sell the watch

1015
03:16:58,920 --> 03:17:13,659
stones. Battery. I'm going to sell both drugs. Sell the meat. I got, I don't have any more meat.

1016
03:17:14,219 --> 03:17:33,100
At least I do. Okay. I don't think I need it. So let's go pills. That's 35.

1017
03:17:34,459 --> 03:17:44,469
I actually don't have to sell these pills. Grab the gasoline. I'll take it. All right. We're fine.

1018
03:17:44,469 --> 03:17:56,969
Okay. Refill. And I have a watch. So it's eight AM permanently until I leave.

1019
03:17:57,930 --> 03:18:28,040
I need to fill this. Looks good. It's almost empty. Night starts at 20. Good to know. Tank is empty.

1020
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:36,739
Let's go turn it off. I now have enough for at least one or two nights. There's nothing else in

1021
03:18:36,739 --> 03:18:44,840
here. Put the pills back. Have the watch. Put everything back. Bring a rag with me.

1022
03:18:46,870 --> 03:18:54,299
And why is this? The only two rope can fit on one. All right. Bottle. No. All right. I need

1023
03:18:55,100 --> 03:19:03,659
torch. I need, I need like an alcohol or something to put to, I don't have any. I have nothing.

1024
03:19:04,219 --> 03:19:16,149
I have nothing. I'm going to get this to, I have to make this full. I have to. Okay. I've got my

1025
03:19:16,149 --> 03:19:23,190
watch. I've got my board. I'm going down here to get my inventory. It's just one person down there.

1026
03:19:23,190 --> 03:19:40,040
I've got my watch. I'm ready to go. Let's go. Good luck for your law degree. Thanks. I'm trying.

1027
03:19:40,040 --> 03:19:50,100
Don't mess this up. I need to find mushrooms too. Okay. Perfect. I need to just kill the

1028
03:19:50,100 --> 03:19:55,020
dude that's in here. I don't want to take any unnecessary stuff in my inventory.

1029
03:19:55,739 --> 03:20:04,569
So essentially it's one minute a second kind of, sort of. All right. Here we go. Into the woods.

1030
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:10,360
Is that guy just out of the house now? Or is he going to be standing somewhere in particular?

1031
03:20:11,239 --> 03:20:18,819
This is going to, okay. Don't panic. Don't accidentally press one of the 17 useless

1032
03:20:18,819 --> 03:20:36,860
keys on the keyboard that you have. He's going to be right here somewhere. How did I get down

1033
03:20:36,860 --> 03:21:06,950
there before? Through the other side? Okay. What's that? What is that? Is it a bug? What's that?

1034
03:21:09,590 --> 03:21:30,809
Dead bug. Bug. Shell. Where the hell is he? Fucking butcher. Hold on. There's no gas in here.

1035
03:21:39,430 --> 03:22:32,840
Not shift. You motherfucker. Where are you? Okay. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1036
03:22:32,840 --> 03:23:22,219
Come on out. One, two, three, go. That's it, right? Nobody else. Okay. Alcohol. Note.

1037
03:23:23,100 --> 03:23:27,579
The door code is three, three, three, three. It can't get any easier. Remember it. I'm not opening

1038
03:23:27,579 --> 03:23:32,700
that door after dark anymore. I went to get some gasoline from the pig shed. I'll be back after

1039
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:52,440
dark. Gas from the pig shed. What is that? Shiny stone for the 130 bucks. All right. I need to

1040
03:23:52,440 --> 03:24:09,909
use bandage. Is my inventory down here somewhere? Where's my inventory? Where is it? Is it not here?

1041
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:33,110
Corpse. Chair. Wardrobe. Take all that stuff. Lamp. Oh, backpack. All right. I'm leaving.

1042
03:24:33,110 --> 03:24:39,110
I know the code and I know that there's gasoline in the pig shed. I'm out. What time is it? 11.

1043
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:54,309
That's enough time to get out of here. Code two. All right. Get me out. I'm panicking right now.

1044
03:24:54,309 --> 03:25:08,120
I'm just so fucking nervous. What's that noise? Why is there a noise? The thing's about to be out.

1045
03:25:08,840 --> 03:25:46,329
Three, three, three, three. Sleeper. Sleeper. Who's sleeping? Shotgun and a map of the forest.

1046
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:58,120
Is the guy sleeping? What do I do? Should I kill him? He's going to get up and he's going to attack

1047
03:25:58,120 --> 03:26:06,899
me. Right? I have to leave. Hey there, friend. Hey there. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Yes. In the last hideout,

1048
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:35,540
look for an exit beneath the floor. He's going to fuck. He's a friend. He's going to get up and

1049
03:26:35,540 --> 03:26:47,459
run up just like that. Like I told you. He called you friend. That doesn't matter. I have to leave

1050
03:26:47,459 --> 03:26:55,540
now. I'm not going this way. Anybody that's alive is going to stand up and sprint at you. That's how

1051
03:26:55,540 --> 03:27:02,579
these games work. I can't let that happen. Not with this much stuff in my inventory and no torches,

1052
03:27:02,579 --> 03:27:13,780
by the way. So, okay. I have to leave now. I have to leave right now. Get out of here now.

1053
03:27:14,979 --> 03:27:30,700
Please get me out. I don't know how to get out of here. Okay. There it is. I'm sorry. If an NPC

1054
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:38,540
has a dialogue option that's like trade, gossip, talk. We're good. If you're rolling around on the

1055
03:27:38,540 --> 03:27:54,459
ground and I don't know who you are and there is no dialogue options. He's a friend. There are no

1056
03:27:54,459 --> 03:28:04,170
such thing as friends. Not in a post-apocalyptic world. I made it though. I don't have enough

1057
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:18,440
gasoline. All right. I can't look at chat anymore. Sorry. No more chatting. And so why am I just doing

1058
03:28:18,440 --> 03:28:46,780
that? All right. I'm here. No. Now I'm in the wrong spot. So, 3-3. That's how you get down

1059
03:28:48,790 --> 03:28:54,250
here. And then this is the silent forest hideout. I'm assuming I eventually have to end up up here

1060
03:28:54,250 --> 03:29:05,079
somewhere. Here we go. Let's fill this up with the gas that we have. No. Which I should have. I got

1061
03:29:05,079 --> 03:29:11,540
plenty. What is this? A piece of wood? A staff made of wooden unknown origin. And I have shotgun

1062
03:29:11,540 --> 03:29:32,280
shells too. This is pretty good. Okay. Let's fill this up. Not bad. Now this is a weapon. Let me go

1063
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:43,399
back. Let me go to my weapon crafting bench. Let's see if I have anything new to do. Upgrade

1064
03:29:43,399 --> 03:29:57,909
workshop. I need, I don't know, is that toolbox? Shell, rag, alcohol. Okay. Let me make some more.

1065
03:29:57,909 --> 03:30:05,860
Shiny stone. That's worth a lot. All right. Let's take out the bandages. I have three bandages.

1066
03:30:06,579 --> 03:30:20,569
An image link is here. It's all right. Torch. I can make one. So make one. I need board. I can.

1067
03:30:23,530 --> 03:30:29,479
All right. I can make three torches. I need to turn on the thing out here. Let's do that.

1068
03:30:35,260 --> 03:30:44,700
Is it a bear or something? What was that? 25 fuel. Shit. Shouldn't have used it all, huh?

1069
03:30:47,979 --> 03:31:00,500
What happened to my watch? Oh, it's in the workshop. Never take that watch off. Ever. That's

1070
03:31:00,500 --> 03:31:20,520
fine. Alcohol. I have three bandages. One torch. Board with nails. Upgrades. Hardened. More nails

1071
03:31:20,520 --> 03:31:42,020
and light. And flex more. Yeah. All right. Prepare it. I need boards and uh-oh. Should I have done

1072
03:31:42,020 --> 03:31:55,750
that booger eating stance? Everyone's focusing on boogers and pee. That sounds about right. I need

1073
03:31:55,750 --> 03:32:03,319
more fuel, which means I have to live tonight and then buy fuel tomorrow. Yeah. That's the play.

1074
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:18,299
I got enough. Let me see. Let me just lock some doors here. I need some supplies. Right there.

1075
03:32:19,100 --> 03:32:30,100
I actually think I want to bring this into the other room. That was a nice reference. Somebody

1076
03:32:30,100 --> 03:32:41,690
else said it on me. These are all still good. I can't cook anything. Oven efficiency one. How

1077
03:32:41,690 --> 03:32:59,610
do I make my oven better? This is still good. All this is still fine. The other hideouts. Oh, okay.

1078
03:33:01,829 --> 03:33:06,780
I see. I feel you. All right. So we got to get ready.

1079
03:33:08,809 --> 03:33:18,500
Pull this back. What do I think about the game so far? The visibility thing seems frustrating,

1080
03:33:18,500 --> 03:33:25,719
but cool. Oh, I think it's, I think it's good. I think I'm slowly starting to understand what

1081
03:33:25,719 --> 03:33:38,149
I'm even supposed to be doing, but uh, I think it's good. I think it's fun. He hates it. Well,

1082
03:33:38,149 --> 03:33:48,780
I mean, I'll probably uninstall it after this stream today, but I'm kidding. It's a joke. All

1083
03:33:48,780 --> 03:34:00,680
right. At least you're honest. We'll see how far I get. Torch. Free bandages. I need to repair this

1084
03:34:01,319 --> 03:34:05,909
before it becomes too late. Although while there's still some time left,

1085
03:34:06,950 --> 03:34:12,440
I'm going to go see if I can find some nails. Where have I not gone? I haven't gone like over

1086
03:34:12,440 --> 03:34:23,420
here. I'm just going to check it out really quick. Is it a survival game? Yeah, kind of.

1087
03:34:24,579 --> 03:34:47,299
It's a top down, it's a top down horror survival esque game. So yeah, it is. Okay.

1088
03:34:47,860 --> 03:34:56,250
Dry meadow. I'm up here now somewhere around 19 or so. I got to turn around. Nothing over here.

1089
03:34:56,809 --> 03:35:08,819
You know, like random logs or anything. Oh, if you have any of the horror games that I have not

1090
03:35:08,819 --> 03:35:17,530
played on stream, at least, or in a while toss them in the recommended for the discord because

1091
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:23,620
I would play a bunch of horror games this month because obviously it makes sense. Right.

1092
03:35:24,420 --> 03:35:32,790
This is not, I'm not going to find anything over here. No, it's not worth it.

1093
03:35:33,350 --> 03:35:43,690
I just need to live one more day. Yeah, it's not worth it. Let's get me out of here.

1094
03:35:44,969 --> 03:36:02,010
Do PT. Didn't I do PT on stream? I don't remember. I know I played PT, but did I play on stream? I

1095
03:36:02,010 --> 03:36:07,610
don't know. Probably not. All right. I have to get the hell out of here. I must return to my hideup

1096
03:36:07,610 --> 03:36:21,479
before night. I know that's what I'm doing. Let's hide. So it was a good game.

1097
03:36:25,850 --> 03:36:51,500
I have heard it's a good game. How long is Soma? Move the bookcase like eight hours.

1098
03:36:52,059 --> 03:37:03,639
That's not bad. That's good. Check the door doors. Oh, okay. Good, good, good, good, good.

1099
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:19,959
All right. Close this one. Lock it up. It's like two to three average German streams, but one

1100
03:37:19,959 --> 03:37:23,639
playthrough of Soma. Everybody's saying that I'm not going to be capable of beating it in like eight

1101
03:37:23,639 --> 03:37:32,620
hours. I think it's going to take me like 20 plus hours to beat it. What did you say? It might take

1102
03:37:32,620 --> 03:37:41,110
me 20 hours to beat that game. Is that some kind of challenge? It's around 16 hours. Well, that's

1103
03:37:41,110 --> 03:37:53,139
double what the last person said. The number would be good too. We'll check them out. All right. I

1104
03:37:53,139 --> 03:37:59,319
got to pay attention because this is an important day because then after this, we're going down to

1105
03:37:59,319 --> 03:38:09,780
the silent forest hideout. Every time I talk about something random during this, nothing happens.

1106
03:38:10,340 --> 03:38:25,690
I need another topic to go off on. Oh, my stream title is terrible. That's really bad. When your

1107
03:38:25,690 --> 03:38:30,250
stream title is the name of the game category and there's no difference. When somebody's browsing

1108
03:38:30,250 --> 03:38:34,090
through Twitch, it just says Darkwood Darkwood. And they think that there's something wrong with

1109
03:38:34,090 --> 03:38:44,020
their browser. And then they don't come to the stream. I should put Darkwood. I should put this

1110
03:38:44,020 --> 03:38:49,989
in brackets. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. So it's like the title is Darkwood Brackets one.

1111
03:38:53,659 --> 03:39:16,420
Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Okay. So now if you go out to the Twitch browser,

1112
03:39:17,379 --> 03:39:24,540
it'll say like Darkwood Darkwood one and you'll wait. They named it twice, but that's weird.

1113
03:39:26,549 --> 03:39:37,270
Looks a bit weird. Don't refresh. Well, yeah, I wouldn't refresh because you'll get an ad.

1114
03:39:37,989 --> 03:39:53,270
Somebody here. How are they in here? Are they in here? He's fighting the dogs outside. That was

1115
03:39:53,270 --> 03:39:56,309
really close. That was right outside the door. He's not going to like shoot a gun in here, right?

1116
03:39:56,950 --> 03:40:23,989
They don't sophisticated. Do they? I'm going to assume morning is like five, like 530.

1117
03:40:36,870 --> 03:40:45,379
Are they people or are they zombies? I really don't know. I think they're infected people.

1118
03:40:46,100 --> 03:41:06,979
Can you sleep? You cannot sleep. You have to just weather the storm. They can't get in.

1119
03:41:06,979 --> 03:41:13,030
This is a good strategy. I like this. Two lamps in front of the door, both barricaded.

1120
03:41:14,149 --> 03:41:20,649
Do I think that hot lava is worth buying? Um, it depends on how much you'd like to jump

1121
03:41:21,370 --> 03:41:41,059
and grab stuff. Who did it? Answer it. Did we get him? Did we get the streamer?

1122
03:41:43,540 --> 03:42:16,520
Close the door. He's throwing. Oh no, don't die in here. Oh, please. Why did you open it? I was

1123
03:42:16,520 --> 03:42:25,620
closing it. Oh no. How did he get in? Did he actually get in? He got in and it's one of these

1124
03:42:25,620 --> 03:42:32,659
guys. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm blocked. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead here. Just don't. What

1125
03:42:32,659 --> 03:42:49,540
do I do? Come on, Foxy's right in front of me. Duckies to my right. I can hear Freddy. I can

1126
03:42:49,540 --> 03:43:16,149
hear him through this ear. I need to do something about that. I can't continue like that. Gasoline's

1127
03:43:16,149 --> 03:43:22,579
the easy answer to be able to get planks. I'm going to bring the dresser. Yeah, that's not a

1128
03:43:22,579 --> 03:43:31,690
bad idea. Weapon parts. I have something for you actually. I have something for you. Should I sell

1129
03:43:31,690 --> 03:43:41,989
the jewel? Whatever it is. Cause I have some stuff that's worth some money. I got pills. I got the

1130
03:43:42,229 --> 03:43:51,000
shells. It's worth 130 bucks. Shiny stone. I don't think I'm ever gonna have a shotgun.

1131
03:43:51,719 --> 03:44:09,959
At least not now. I'm just gonna do it. Whatever. If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea. It's okay

1132
03:44:09,959 --> 03:44:28,280
though. I need stuff now, not stuff later. 200. I'll have a lot. Which then can get me

1133
03:44:31,079 --> 03:44:44,950
fabric. I need this. I still need gas too though. Handgun, bolt handle, long barrel.

1134
03:44:45,750 --> 03:45:02,520
What about the axe, blade, shovel? There's too many things to do.

1135
03:45:07,139 --> 03:45:16,420
I don't know. There's too many diff. I don't know. I don't know.

1136
03:45:20,409 --> 03:45:30,360
Wire. It's done. Whatever it is, it's done. Gasoline too. Bucket. Like I need it. Okay.

1137
03:45:30,360 --> 03:45:49,079
Front door. Front door. Front door. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1138
03:45:50,120 --> 03:46:06,100
All right. The front door. Now I need something better than that. All right. Now I need to fill

1139
03:46:06,100 --> 03:46:37,659
this up a little bit. Okay. Turn this generator off. Sour Jupiter. Really? Nice job. All right.

1140
03:46:37,659 --> 03:46:47,719
Now I can make... What the hell happened? Lockpick. At least I have a lockpick now.

1141
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:55,579
I need to repair this, which means I have to go... Wait. Did I turn it off?

1142
03:46:56,459 --> 03:47:09,219
I did, right? Yeah. Why do I have loud P? That's an old reference that I have not seen in a very long

1143
03:47:09,219 --> 03:47:21,450
time. It's been a while. All right. Planks. Need them. Planks. Need them. Planks. Need them. Plenty

1144
03:47:21,450 --> 03:47:28,420
now. Repair this. It now does more damage, which is good. And then I need to move some stuff.

1145
03:47:29,139 --> 03:48:00,629
Oh, shit. I need nails. What was that? You guys heard that, right? All right. Can I buy nails?

1146
03:48:01,860 --> 03:48:22,250
I can. Just give me 10. I heard that if somebody was walking around. All right. Now this thing is

1147
03:48:22,250 --> 03:48:37,899
good. How many torches do I have? Zero. I want at least two. Seems good to me. I need whatever that

1148
03:48:37,899 --> 03:48:48,229
is. I am going to board this shuttle, because what's the point of leaving out this front door?

1149
03:48:48,870 --> 03:48:55,079
There is none. I always go out the back door anyways. I need more nails. I need two more nails.

1150
03:48:56,200 --> 03:49:16,649
Don't do that. Why not? No, I'm doing it. That's how they keep getting in. Dermot, you answer the

1151
03:49:16,649 --> 03:49:30,889
door when it knocks at night. Should I really be doing that? Okay. Give me the other gasoline.

1152
03:49:30,889 --> 03:49:51,459
I'll take it. All right. I'm done. Lockpick. Get rid of the boards. Keep two torches. One in the...

1153
03:49:52,260 --> 03:49:56,979
here. Get rid of the bottle. Get rid of the stone. Keep the bandages. Keep the lockpick.

1154
03:49:58,200 --> 03:50:04,600
It's time to explore. I'm ready. I'm going for it. I've got a good weapon now. I'm going...

1155
03:50:05,399 --> 03:50:15,290
I don't know. Burn down house. Or the... I mean, this is where I need to go.

1156
03:50:15,850 --> 03:50:26,889
I can go up. Okay. I'm gonna go up. Up. I have heels, right? I have three bandages.

1157
03:50:27,530 --> 03:51:07,020
Let's go. I'm gonna go straight up into the air. Go that way. Ah, this is a high-level zone.

1158
03:51:08,149 --> 03:51:27,209
I went into the high-level zone. Where are you going? Where are you going?

1159
03:51:27,209 --> 03:52:27,209
Where's it going? Why'd it do that? I got a shiny stone. I got it. Why is there a rooster? All right.

1160
03:52:28,090 --> 03:52:37,299
Why did they run away? Is this dog dead? This dog doesn't look dead.

1161
03:52:39,639 --> 03:52:53,049
Where am I? Where the hell am I? Oh, this is the burnt house. I can do this now.

1162
03:53:11,750 --> 03:53:23,030
I can do this shit now. All right. Stuff. Stuff. Anything. Search the sack. Alcohol.

1163
03:53:24,569 --> 03:53:30,549
Bedding. Nobody in the bed. Wardrobe. Oh, there's a flare in here and there's pills in here, too.

1164
03:53:31,430 --> 03:53:41,719
A note from the burnt house. I know they're there. I can hear them laughing. They're behind the wall

1165
03:53:41,719 --> 03:53:49,670
of trees. I can't get through by myself. The trees go... grow back too fast. Double mushroom.

1166
03:53:50,229 --> 03:54:16,149
Oh, this is perfect. Mushrooms. Just behind the trees. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Sofa.

1167
03:54:17,190 --> 03:55:04,139
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. I might be a little up.

1168
03:55:04,620 --> 03:55:14,260
I'm pretty close to leveling up, I think. Without a doubt. All right. Easy. Come on over here.

1169
03:55:14,260 --> 03:55:31,879
There's a red log. Come here. Come on. What's a red log? There's a pig. Right? The pig. What?

1170
03:55:31,879 --> 03:55:39,139
The pig door? The pig door, right? Something was just on my leg. I'm not kidding. What was it?

1171
03:55:39,700 --> 03:56:02,040
I don't know. I felt something. I promise. Didn't the guy say that there was a pig?

1172
03:56:04,899 --> 03:56:17,940
Red seesaw. What's the significance of the red seesaw? I have a lot of mushrooms now.

1173
03:56:25,799 --> 03:56:40,340
Nothing in here. What? I swear there was a pig door. No. All right. Well, I got the burnt down

1174
03:56:40,340 --> 03:57:15,159
house now. Check the sofa lol. Sofa lol. All right. Okay. White dress. A white child-sized press.

1175
03:57:17,670 --> 03:57:26,360
And the thing that's $450. Do not die. Get this back so I can- that's a lot of money.

1176
03:57:26,360 --> 03:58:03,370
Let me see. Right there. All right. I'm up. Why am I- people are asking why I'm killing the dogs.

1177
03:58:03,930 --> 03:58:10,659
Because they're trying to kill me and I'm just trying to live. I've got a $450

1178
03:58:10,659 --> 03:58:23,479
piece of fabric in my back. I am not going to lose that one. Bingo. Nice. All right.

1179
03:58:25,340 --> 03:59:05,299
Every time. I swear. Hot bar upgrade. Inventory upgrade. Okay. I wanted the slots. Only two slots.

1180
03:59:11,190 --> 03:59:31,239
Antidote. No, no. I want to level up. Speaking of that. 120 out of 150. I need three more mushrooms

1181
03:59:31,239 --> 03:59:40,360
and I get to level up. Almost new powers. Yeah, I just need three more mushrooms. Oh, that's cool.

1182
03:59:40,360 --> 03:59:45,319
All right. Nice. So the burnt house is pretty much completed. The wedding though. I don't have the

1183
03:59:45,399 --> 03:59:52,120
key code to get in. I should be making some traps. All right. So let's go with chain trap

1184
03:59:54,139 --> 04:00:01,100
and then I'm going to go with bear trap and then I'm going to go chain trap again. Bear trap.

1185
04:00:03,270 --> 04:00:10,200
Now let's take a look. Repair item. Get that completed. I still have a lot of time so I'm

1186
04:00:10,200 --> 04:00:23,239
not going to do this yet. I have a lot of junk in my inventory. I can do this again?

1187
04:00:24,120 --> 04:00:33,270
No, only once. All right. I'm going to take this time here to try and find a chest to open,

1188
04:00:33,270 --> 04:00:38,090
which I think there was a couple over here. I still have about four hours or so.

1189
04:00:46,120 --> 04:00:58,840
There was a chest over here somewhere. Like legitimately right here. Pretty good. Yeah,

1190
04:00:58,840 --> 04:01:11,850
I think that deserves a few peepo dances. Nothing else? Oh, I got a couple of these now.

1191
04:01:12,489 --> 04:01:31,620
I'm going to be making some money now dog. Excuse me. By the way, you can always tell when I look

1192
04:01:31,620 --> 04:01:49,610
at chat when I go like this is that you guys are right there. All right. Now this is the underground

1193
04:01:49,610 --> 04:01:54,940
passage place, which I can't do anything here. This is the end game. That's how you leave. That's

1194
04:01:54,940 --> 04:02:14,010
how you win. I'm trying to find mushrooms though in the few hours I have. Win, win, win, win, win.

1195
04:02:14,010 --> 04:02:20,899
I can't win. Not yet. I'm going to head. I'm going back down towards wedding, but I need to find a

1196
04:02:20,899 --> 04:02:38,459
couple more mushroom. I've already done this. And the anime is lame. All right. I, why are you

1197
04:02:38,459 --> 04:03:16,889
saying that? Where did that come from? Wire, alcohol, magazine. Is it GQ or better homes and

1198
04:03:16,889 --> 04:03:55,290
gardens? Just farming those minus twos. Don't mind me. Minus two for every dog that you kill.

1199
04:03:55,930 --> 04:04:22,840
It's not fair. I can't. It's too far away. All right. I've got to get back.

1200
04:04:25,260 --> 04:04:34,149
My face came too dark. Oh, I'll fix it later. Where the hell am I? Oh, wait a minute.

1201
04:04:34,790 --> 04:04:45,719
Is this back at the? Yep. All right. This is back at the scrap yard. Yeah. All right. Let's go.

1202
04:04:46,440 --> 04:04:55,190
Ooh, that's a corpse area. I missed no room and inventory.

1203
04:04:57,420 --> 04:05:29,459
Shit. I need those nails. Uh, what was that? I don't, nevermind. Let's get me out of here.

1204
04:05:30,180 --> 04:05:43,239
All right. What should I eat? What do you guys think? What do you think is the number one thing

1205
04:05:43,239 --> 04:05:48,420
I should eat? Oh, nevermind. I can't eat anything. That's you guys would suggest.

1206
04:05:50,500 --> 04:05:55,500
Right. I'm on like, I'm on a, nevermind. I have to eat the stuff that's in the fridge.

1207
04:05:56,299 --> 04:06:02,440
Dammit. That sucks. I can't eat like loaded potato skins. Like somebody just said, I have to eat

1208
04:06:04,260 --> 04:06:12,309
lettuce, like plain meat. I have to do a FODMAP diet for like a week or two.

1209
04:06:13,110 --> 04:06:23,079
But should you guys know how hard it is to do a FODMAP diet? A FODMAP diet is you cannot have

1210
04:06:23,079 --> 04:06:30,809
any form of garlic or onion or fructose, essentially. It's a carbohydrate thing.

1211
04:06:31,770 --> 04:06:40,729
And weirdly enough, garlic and onion is in every single goddamn food in this entire country of the

1212
04:06:40,729 --> 04:06:47,530
United States of America. Garlic powder, onion salt, onion powder. It's in everything. It's

1213
04:06:47,530 --> 04:06:54,040
in every single food in the whole country. So I can't really go out to eat until I figure that

1214
04:06:54,040 --> 04:07:03,860
out. Oh, and I love onions. I love, okay, hold on. I love onions. I love garlic. It's one of my

1215
04:07:03,860 --> 04:07:09,750
favorite things on earth, but I cannot eat it for a while. That's the unfortunate thing. I don't

1216
04:07:09,750 --> 04:07:18,790
know. I got a lot of gas, so I'm going to go sell this magazine. No, I think I can, let's just turn

1217
04:07:18,790 --> 04:08:08,170
it on. Let's just, I got plenty of gas, but now I need to block this door. I ain't dying. Okay. It's

1218
04:08:08,170 --> 04:08:15,590

1220
04:09:02,790 --> 04:09:06,549
Oh, no, that's not good. I don't have time to change. You want to. I don't have time change it.

1221
04:09:06,549 --> 04:09:09,620
I don't have time to change it. I have time to change. I don't have time to do it all. I

who saved me then held me captive i don't know how i

1416
04:43:42,340 --> 04:43:45,700
managed to escape his hut ended up here what i do know is that the

1417
04:43:45,700 --> 04:43:49,299
insane fucker took my key my only chance to

1418
04:43:49,299 --> 04:43:53,459
get out of the woods he also took out all the pages from my

1419
04:43:53,459 --> 04:43:57,139
journal i doubt that he was able to learn the location of the

1420
04:43:57,139 --> 04:44:00,020
underground passage though i should check if the door is still

1421
04:44:00,020 --> 04:44:04,180
locked just to be sure i must find him i don't think he

1422
04:44:04,180 --> 04:44:07,459
still lives in the same place where he held me makes no difference

1423
04:44:07,459 --> 04:44:10,979
as i have no idea how to get back to that vile place

1424
04:44:10,979 --> 04:44:17,540

if you're gonna if you're gonna be a streamer don't yawn on stream

1430
04:44:51,909 --> 04:44:55,990

1835
05:53:35,049 --> 05:53:38,169

stream dark wood 2 in fact dark wood no but i can't do

1837
05:53:48,419 --> 05:54:00,540

05:54:00,540 --> 05:54:11,270
dark wood one dash copy of dark wood that's funny okay that's that's what it

what happened to the bitcoin donation that doesn't exist anymore

1846
05:55:05,139 --> 05:55:08,180
i had an ethereum address that was down there and i think

1847
05:55:08,180 --> 05:55:11,939
four or five dollars went through it over a year and a half

1848
05:55:11,939 --> 05:55:18,810
i don't have that down there anymore it's all good though

1849
05:55:18,810 --> 05:55:25,740
but thank you too oh wait a second this is the wrong music

1850
05:55:25,740 --> 05:55:31,509

1857
05:56:08,330 --> 05:56:12,889

1863
05:56:37,080 --> 05:56:39,720
the past two weeks while grinding mmos after work

1864
05:56:39,720 --> 05:56:43,419
and it's been a blast it's a small token of appreciation also play

05:56:43,419 --> 05:56:50,279
indivisible it just got released i actually saw that

1866
05:56:50,279 --> 05:56:55,029
i seem pretty mixed things about it though people seem to really like that

1867
05:56:55,029 --> 05:57:06,659
game or really not like that game seems interesting though it's like an

1868
05:57:06,659 --> 05:57:19,400

dub ski dude thank you for the 250 bits appreciate it

1871
05:57:28,310 --> 05:57:31,990
this game is concrete proof that you are in fact an on-demand streamer

1872
05:57:31,990 --> 05:57:34,869
been waiting to say that for months thanks for playing this game by the way

1873
05:57:34,869 --> 05:57:41,830
dark wood is fantastic on demand streamer what do you mean

1874
05:57:41,830 --> 05:57:49,130
so is gifting yourself subs a way to avoid taxes

1875
05:57:49,130 --> 05:58:01,939
uh no no actually you can turn the content

1876
05:58:02,020 --> 05:58:15,029
on demand the truth comes out uh no that's not how it works

1877
05:58:15,029 --> 05:58:23,000

here the dog emote i used my gamer keyboard

1896
06:00:26,630 --> 06:00:31,319
last week i created a g key function in vanilla wow

1897
06:00:31,319 --> 06:00:34,680
to buy a rear pattern before anyone else could

1898
06:00:34,680 --> 06:00:38,360
it did multiple macro functions at once within the period of a few seconds

1899
06:00:38,360 --> 06:00:41,080
making my life easier i also have a key that i pressed that

1900
06:00:41,080 --> 06:00:44,490
says germa's short in twitch chat while i play a game

1901
06:00:44,490 --> 06:00:48,619
um i don't think you should have sent that in a message

1902
06:00:50,139 --> 06:01:04,259
i don't think that's legal it's legal is it legal

1903
06:01:04,259 --> 06:01:11,259
i remember okay this i think there's a video of this happening

1904
06:01:11,259 --> 06:01:17,020
if you spun around in world of warcraft fast enough the game would disconnect you

1905
06:01:17,020 --> 06:01:21,459
from the client me mlc stealth inside there

1906
06:01:21,459 --> 06:01:23,540
was another there was like two or three other people there

1907
06:01:23,540 --> 06:01:29,419
but there was a video of this of mlc stealth spinning around at five

1908
06:01:29,419 --> 06:01:32,680
thousand miles per hour and he just gets booted and we just

1909
06:01:32,680 --> 06:01:41,610
kept getting booted from the game you had to it was a joke though it was

1910
06:01:41,610 --> 06:01:43,930
not oh let me just spin around with my mouse

1911
06:01:43,930 --> 06:01:47,450
you had to turn your dpi up to like 10 000

1912
06:01:47,450 --> 06:01:50,889
and then just have your character go like a blender in a circle

1913
06:01:50,889 --> 06:02:00,139
and you get you got like kicked out there's a video from like

1914
06:02:00,139 --> 06:02:05,900

1966
06:09:09,290 --> 06:09:18,180
janitor up here please and that's the cam that cam is on

1967
06:09:18,180 --> 06:09:22,500

1968
06:09:22,500 --> 06:09:29,669
all right let's keep going i forgot that was the cam button

1969
06:09:29,669 --> 06:09:35,639
all right so we also had uh oh it was the person that said they had a

1970
06:09:35,639 --> 06:09:41,990
macro for a while right okay my face is the same color as

1971
06:09:41,990 --> 06:09:53,669
this shirt what are you talking about i don't have it

1972
06:09:53,669 --> 06:09:57,939
orange it's not orange it's just like it's like a little tint of red

1973
06:09:57,939 --> 06:10:01,930
i've been it's hot in here do you know where i live

1974
06:10:01,930 --> 06:10:18,439
like it's cold thank you too uh sad vega though appreciate uh they say uh

1975
06:10:18,439 --> 06:10:22,439
germa i work in it and i can tell you the fn key is very useful for fixing

1976
06:10:22,439 --> 06:10:28,340
people who accidentally turn off their wi-fi

1977
06:10:28,340 --> 06:10:33,860
exactly why it doesn't need to fucking exist

1978
06:10:33,860 --> 06:10:37,860
why would you have a function key to turn off your wi-fi

1979
06:10:37,860 --> 06:10:44,659
just click in the bottom right of your screen and disconnect

1980
06:10:44,659 --> 06:10:47,700
uh and alter their screen when they accidentally press the fn key and

1981
06:10:47,700 --> 06:10:52,220
another key in a combo yeah i don't get it

1982
06:10:52,220 --> 06:10:56,619
you could make every single key 10 larger

1983
06:10:56,619 --> 06:10:59,659
if they was half these keys didn't exist there's so much more key real

1984
06:10:59,659 --> 06:11:02,380
estate your enter key could be bigger your

1985
06:11:02,380 --> 06:11:06,139
spacebar could be longer and larger your alt your control could be

1986
06:11:06,139 --> 06:11:10,900
bigger key you don't need bigger keys sometimes you do

1987
06:11:10,900 --> 06:11:18,220
it's an apple key on on an ipad or whatever whatever

1988
06:11:18,220 --> 06:11:21,909
but thank you uh sad vega appreciate the insight

1989
06:11:21,909 --> 06:11:24,709

uh appreciate the ten dollars there for when you have to wait out the night

2004
06:12:57,700 --> 06:13:00,500
you should move the lamps away from the windows as the light seeping through

2005
06:13:00,500 --> 06:13:06,759
will attract monsters this is essential for surviving nights later in the game i

2006
06:13:06,759 --> 06:13:09,500
have to now that i'm in a new space tomorrow

2007
06:13:09,500 --> 06:13:12,299
we're gonna really start to move around and we need some french rearrangement

2008
06:13:12,299 --> 06:13:26,180
here people why are people so strange uh

2009
06:13:26,180 --> 06:13:31,080
anyways thank you narcoleptic bear appreciate thank you dino pulse

2010
06:13:31,080 --> 06:13:35,959
zeta for the 500 bits do you think you could eat as much garlic as wario and

2011
06:13:35,959 --> 06:13:39,000
be able to fart as much as him if you wanted to

2012
06:13:44,569 --> 06:13:51,979
i'll tell you wario is way healthier than mario

2013
06:13:51,979 --> 06:14:09,060
wario eats garlic mario eats flowers that burn down his esophagus

2014
06:14:09,060 --> 06:14:15,000
wario only and mushrooms mushrooms and hot sauce

2015
06:14:15,000 --> 06:14:21,189
wario eats garlic and he's got some weight on him so you know that he's

2016
06:14:21,189 --> 06:14:32,299
probably eating some beef wario is 100 muscle shrooms and hot

2017
06:14:32,299 --> 06:14:39,540
sauce yeah that's not a great diet and sometimes cake he gets eats a ton of

2018
06:14:39,540 --> 06:14:47,139
candy and sweets too what else does mario eat mario

2019
06:14:47,139 --> 06:14:50,659
eats spicy food like just hot stuff like hot

2020
06:14:50,659 --> 06:14:53,479
sauce mushrooms but does he eat the mushrooms

2021
06:14:53,479 --> 06:15:01,000
or does it they just like disintegrate into his body

2022
06:15:01,000 --> 06:15:08,740
he eats like bird feathers cherries bird feathers

2023
06:15:08,740 --> 06:15:17,619
that's mario doesn't even even eat food wario at least eats food

2024
06:15:17,619 --> 06:15:22,180
his candy is not really technically it is technically a food

2025
06:15:22,180 --> 06:15:25,939
it's just like sugar but that's like a food group i mean no maybe it's not

2026
06:15:25,939 --> 06:15:33,110
it's not really food is it it's a carbohydrate what is food would

2027
06:15:33,110 --> 06:15:37,830
you break it down to an absolute zero it's just energy sugar is just energy

2028
06:15:37,830 --> 06:15:42,759
so it is you can't get energy out of a bird feather

2029
06:15:42,759 --> 06:15:53,209
luigi doesn't can't eat luigi eats the same stuff as mario

2030
06:15:53,209 --> 06:15:58,330
heat is food yes when you eat something it just gets converted into heat in your

2031
06:15:58,330 --> 06:16:01,959
body and energy and then you burn it then you have to fill

2032
06:16:01,959 --> 06:16:04,840
it again it's just like a bit you're just a gas tank

2033
06:16:04,840 --> 06:16:14,279
i mean that's true yes i mean that but that that's just basic

2034
06:16:14,279 --> 06:16:19,220
basic just raw science i could go into more of that

2035
06:16:19,220 --> 06:16:28,139
everything has energy idiot oh yeah so if i ate uh if i ate the like

2036
06:16:28,139 --> 06:16:34,009
the glass here that i could i would turn that into energy

2037
06:16:34,009 --> 06:16:40,549
i would not i would i would not if i sucked on this piece of plastic

2038
06:16:40,549 --> 06:16:46,419
red air i'm not gonna get any energy from that i can't turn that into heat

2039
06:16:46,419 --> 06:16:58,939
kelvin that's not your name that's the temperature that you use

stream that's not gonna happen ever so just you have to accept that

2061
06:19:15,459 --> 06:19:19,560
that's not gonna happen the closest you're gonna get is when i

2062
06:19:19,560 --> 06:19:22,200
put that thing or that little choker thing around

2063
06:19:22,200 --> 06:19:27,240
that's it that's the only image you're gonna ever have

2064
06:19:27,240 --> 06:19:31,939
what are these messages i'm telling you i don't know

2065

06:19:46,939 --> 06:19:52,279
appreciate it gnarly thanks for the 250

2068
06:19:52,840 --> 06:19:57,240
by the way i saw people suggesting you play sc6 after you showed my characters

2069
06:19:57,240 --> 06:20:00,119
on stream i just want to warn you the character

2070
06:20:00,119 --> 06:20:03,319
creator is really restrictive and not really worth it when compared to wwe games

2071
06:20:03,319 --> 06:20:09,060
plus i'd have to play soul caliber which i don't want to do i don't have

2072
06:20:09,060 --> 06:20:11,700
anything against soul caliber i'm just saying i don't

2073
06:20:11,700 --> 06:20:14,659
i don't really want to play soul caliber you don't just make those characters

2074
06:20:14,659 --> 06:20:18,020
and then just don't do anything you have to play soul caliber

2075
06:20:18,020 --> 06:20:22,040
i'd get frustrated you know what would happen i don't even need to tell you

2076
06:20:22,040 --> 06:20:26,200
what would happen i would get shit on twice in a row and

2077
06:20:26,200 --> 06:20:29,560
i would it would piss me off more than anything and i would quit the game

2078
06:20:29,560 --> 06:20:32,119
and it would just be one of those streams or it was like oh he got like

2079
06:20:32,119 --> 06:20:36,549
angry like once every two or three years it'd be that stream

2080
06:20:36,549 --> 06:20:44,619
do cpu versus cpu no i'd still get angry because my guy didn't win

2081
06:20:44,619 --> 06:20:51,130
but yeah uh i didn't really have a plan but

2082

2106
06:22:50,360 --> 06:22:53,880
that i'd have to eat a bunch more of good salad because they eat a shitload

2107
06:22:53,880 --> 06:22:57,259
of greens and healthy food so i was trying to

2108
06:22:57,259 --> 06:23:01,020
really sell this to kim by the way hey let's get a bearded dragon

2109
06:23:01,020 --> 06:23:04,939

2110
06:23:04,939 --> 06:23:09,860
gonna eat more salad because we're gonna buy a bunch of

2111
06:23:09,860 --> 06:23:13,130
salad stuff to feed to the bearded dragon and then

2112
06:23:13,130 --> 06:23:24,069

2113
06:23:24,069 --> 06:23:31,939

2119
06:23:56,169 --> 06:24:03,270
on fickle pickle just came in with five dollars 500 bits i saw you out but i was

2120
06:24:03,270 --> 06:24:09,479
too afraid to talk to you because you were watching the lizards get sprayed

2121
06:24:09,479 --> 06:24:16,340
but you were at this pet store that i happened to like stumble across

2122
06:24:16,340 --> 06:24:20,729
i literally saw you looking at the lizards

2123
06:24:20,729 --> 06:24:37,880
no you didn't no way this no way holy shit hey those lizards pretty cool

2124
06:24:37,880 --> 06:24:46,419
he spotted out in the wild at like the lizard store

2125
06:24:46,419 --> 06:24:52,009
that's fucking crazy you didn't even know why didn't you say something

2126
06:24:52,009 --> 06:24:58,259
you should have been like hey those lizards are real cool huh

2127
06:24:58,259 --> 06:25:06,840
hi drama and i would have been like hi how are you

2128
06:25:06,840 --> 06:25:12,119
that's fucking crazy you need to have a secret code

2129
06:25:12,119 --> 06:25:19,659
phrase for fans well uh i actually if you are curious i've been doing my

2130
06:25:19,659 --> 06:25:24,599
research and i have been trying to find places in

2131
06:25:24,599 --> 06:25:31,639
like the vegas area that has lizards and uh amphibians

2132
06:25:31,639 --> 06:25:36,500
so i've been to quite a few places interestingly enough

2133
06:25:36,500 --> 06:25:43,930
kim and i actually went to one yesterday and the day before

2134
06:25:43,930 --> 06:25:48,389
i don't think anyone would call you germa in public except for fans that's

2135
06:25:48,389 --> 06:25:54,740
what i'm saying lizard store meetup why would i ever do

2136
06:25:54,740 --> 06:25:59,299
that that would be so that would be so strange

2137
06:26:02,040 --> 06:26:05,400
but there actually are a couple places believe it or not

2138
06:26:05,400 --> 06:26:09,740
like three or four of them you kind of have to go

2139
06:26:09,740 --> 06:26:14,490
a ways but there are some great stores that have great

2140
06:26:14,490 --> 06:26:26,619
great great great selections can i bring my dragon

2141
06:26:26,619 --> 06:26:29,900
no what guys we're not doing a lizard meetup okay

2142
06:26:29,900 --> 06:26:36,700
the secret phrase is pee pants no just say hi

2143
06:26:36,700 --> 06:26:43,110
germa so i'll immediately know that what's going on every if anybody

2144
06:26:43,189 --> 06:26:48,069
sees me in public and it's it's happened a few times

2145
06:26:48,069 --> 06:26:51,990
it's it's all right you can go home say hi just be like hey what's up man

2146
06:26:51,990 --> 06:26:55,669
germa right and i'll be like yeah what's up how are you

2147
06:26:55,669 --> 06:27:09,049
it's happened a few times it's you don't have to you don't have to hide from me

2148
06:27:09,049 --> 06:27:17,669
you'll have to prove it's you now i'm trying to figure out like

2149
06:27:17,669 --> 06:27:21,270
who you were you know what i mean now i'm trying to figure out

2150
06:27:21,270 --> 06:27:24,630
who were you there you know what i'm saying i'm just like hold on and wait a

2151
06:27:24,630 --> 06:27:28,659
minute i'm scanning my memory like where were

2152
06:27:28,659 --> 06:27:30,819
they which was somebody did somebody look at me

2153
06:27:30,819 --> 06:27:34,419
did somebody look at me and like i made eye contact did it may have

2154
06:27:34,419 --> 06:27:44,220
happened once i don't know i'm trapped that's so weird

2155
06:27:44,220 --> 06:27:47,819
that's i that's so that's so interesting

2156
06:27:47,819 --> 06:27:57,349
say hi next time look i'm going all around to all the lizard stores

2157
06:27:57,349 --> 06:28:04,060

2158
06:28:04,139 --> 06:28:11,450
i mean i not really i mean i'll be honest with you

2159
06:28:11,450 --> 06:28:14,889
if if i was to go out and somebody was to say something like hey what's up it's

2160
06:28:14,889 --> 06:28:18,169
it's just like i would say hello to anybody anyways it's like oh hey how are

2166
06:28:37,590 --> 06:28:40,470
the time guys i have conversations with people

2167
06:28:40,470 --> 06:28:44,060

maybe i'll end up with a lizard i missed bits by crunchy pickles

2176
06:29:32,819 --> 06:29:40,069
what about a pet snake um four dollars by the way 400 bits

2177
06:29:40,069 --> 06:29:46,069
i here's the thing about snakes snakes are really really really cool

2178
06:29:46,069 --> 06:29:49,189
they're really really interesting and they're so

2179
06:29:49,189 --> 06:29:57,430
cute like a those ball pythons are just adorable i cannot feed a snake a mouse

2180
06:29:57,430 --> 06:30:11,290
i can't couldn't do it that's the bit that's the wall

2181
06:30:11,290 --> 06:30:15,450
and i know that you can get them frozen right but that's just i don't know i

2182
06:30:15,450 --> 06:30:21,220
can't this is too much for me i could feed a bearded dragon bugs

2183
06:30:21,220 --> 06:30:27,380
and k not kale uh like greens and stuff whatever they eat i have to you know

2184
06:30:27,380 --> 06:30:31,060
obviously still do some research if i'm gonna do it or not i could eat a i could

2185
06:30:31,060 --> 06:30:36,979
feed a bearded dragon bugs but not a rat or something no

2186
06:30:36,979 --> 06:30:46,729
i would get attached to the mouse but none of this is set in stone this is all

2187
06:30:46,729 --> 06:30:50,889
just i've been sort of looking at a handful

2188
06:30:50,889 --> 06:30:56,409
of stores in the area like in the vegas area so i've kind of been hopping

2189
06:30:56,409 --> 06:30:59,049
around like do they sell things do they sell things do they sell things do they

2190
06:30:59,049 --> 06:31:02,279
sell things let's get in the car let's go

2191
06:31:02,360 --> 06:31:06,040
so none of this is really set in stone i'm just doing research i don't know

2192
06:31:06,040 --> 06:31:13,750
i'm obviously trying to ask the right questions you're attached to a frozen

2193
06:31:13,750 --> 06:31:18,119
mouse no you you know what i'm saying though it's not

2194
06:31:18,119 --> 06:31:32,700
that simple if you do it you have to get a lizard cam

2195
06:31:32,700 --> 06:31:43,049
don't be it can't be the dragons just hang out and just sit on your shoulder

2196
06:31:43,049 --> 06:31:48,279
aren't they just super chill but they'll poop on you

2197
06:31:48,279 --> 06:31:54,709
that's all right whatever yeah there's a humidity control i've been

2198
06:31:54,709 --> 06:32:07,319
doing a lot of research they just sit around and act dumb i

2199
06:32:07,319 --> 06:32:10,279
don't know it's it's up there in the brain i'm gonna have to this is this is

2200
06:32:10,279 --> 06:32:14,580
a multi-month decision process by the way like i'm not

2201
06:32:14,580 --> 06:32:17,860
gonna turn the stream on tomorrow and there's gonna be a bearded dragon on

2202
06:32:17,860 --> 06:32:22,099
stream like no this is like a multi it's gonna take like months to figure

2203
06:32:22,099 --> 06:32:29,560
this out but see you guys tomorrow for more dark

2204
06:32:29,560 --> 06:32:34,680
