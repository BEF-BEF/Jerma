1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:10,539
He's not here. Yeah, I am here. I'm gonna one minute can go by before I come and say hello

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:21,750
Hello quick show ads. No, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna show ads during this

3
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:28,710
You don't see ads in the movie theater, but you see ads for other movies before the movie starts

4
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,009
No, i'm not. I don't think I can even do that

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,850
Plus I would just play gemini man trailer five times

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,840
Just pretend I did that

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,810
That'll be

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,390
Forever

9
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,350
Hey, that was a plus two. That was a that was a thought plus two

10
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,990
I didn't do it, but I was thinking about it

11
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,230
Yeah, i've already had a drink. Is there a problem with that?

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,540
I'm 21

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:20,359
Oh, you don't think i'm gonna have a couple glasses of cocktail

14
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:26,250
To watch we're gonna watch public domain. We're gonna watch the gorilla from 1939 guys

15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:36,489
Like i'm i'm gonna have i'm gonna have a drink because that's what i'm gonna do

16
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:43,719
He's not you know, why are you not sober to appreciate the art?

17
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,489
So we have three movies

18
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,549
That are lined up here

19
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,670
because

20
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,670
something that I realized by

21
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,750
starting to put this stuff together is

22
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:03,859
The the trend of movies being more than two fucking hours long

23
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,790
Happened recently

24
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,030
Movies used to be an hour long

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,680
They used to be one to one point over that all these movies are like an hour long one point hour and 20 hour

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,879
And ten hour and ten

27
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,389
I was like, holy shit

28
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:25,189
I'm not gonna be able to watch more than like one or two of these all movies are like an hour and 45 minutes

29
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,590
No, they're not that's just like

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,349
It's like the last five years

31
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:35,300
What about the lord of the rings? That's that's where it started

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,159
Thanks a lot peter jackson more like the last 40 right

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,020
recently

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,849
Well the last like 20 no even movies in the 80s weren't more than an hour and 20 hour and 30

35
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,729
Movies in the night of some movies in the 90s

36
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,860
What about gone with the wind?

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,150
How long was gone how gone with the wind?

38
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,300
runtime

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,539
This is four hours

40
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:18,020
Oh, wait a minute. How long is the intermission in gone of gone with the wind?

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
It was a hundred and fifteen minutes

42
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,460
So yeah, there was there's a there's an there's a more than one full movie length in the middle

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,469
What about the ten commandments?

44
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,340
ten commandments

45
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,060
runtime

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,150
Three hours and 40 minutes

47
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,430
All right, one of the searches for the ten commandments runtime people also ask

48
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,789
Is anyone still alive from the ten commandments and if you think about that like that's

49
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,550
No, probably no that was like thousands of years ago

50
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,949
I don't think so

51
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,719
Is anybody even still alive from when they did that?

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,030
Everyone moses did that is he still alive?

53
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,490
Imagine being

54
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,250
Imagine the internet existed

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,970
during that whole during that time period imagine going back and looking at old pictures of moses instead of like

56
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,259
Fucking abbot and costello

57
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,259
Oh, wow. This is like an old an old moses picture

58
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,279
cool

59
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,779
Well old school cool. It's like moses with a surfboard. What the fuck? I can't even comprehend this. That's like my grandmother

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:54,790
We live in a weird time. Don't we redditor? I know i'm a i'm a front page redditor. We already went over this

61
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,629
I'm not a real redditor. I'm a i'm a redditor that only goes to the first part

62
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,060
But welcome here's the what's on tap tonight

63
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:10,089
We're going to do the gorilla which is an hour long and then we're going to do plan nine from outer space

64
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,569
Which is an hour and 18 minutes

65
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,180
And then we're going to top it off

66
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,480
With santa claus conquers the martians which is also about an hour and 18

67
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,550
So we're going to make a couple of rules here

68
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,899
For how these are going to be watched

69
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
um

70
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,050
Do I get?

71
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,670
at least two

72
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,990
30 second skip vetoes

73
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,860
Like I get to skip 30 seconds

74
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,550
No, why?

75
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,670
Um, I don't know if I know I I I can skip like 20 seconds if I need to

76
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,129
We want to suffer

77
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,209
So these movies weren't gonna be good santa claus conquers the martians is probably gonna be like a good movie

78
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,290
Okay, I got it's probably gonna be a good movie

79
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,740
That's why i'm saving it for last

80
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:20,550
What's 30 seconds going to accomplish?

81
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,149
um, I don't know

82
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,949
Skipping, uh nudity that could be in one of these movies. I don't know the second. I see clothes come off

83
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,829
I'm skipping 30 seconds. That's just the way i'm sorry. That's gonna happen

84
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,110
That's my that's what i'm talking about here

85
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,959
Santa's gonna be nude. I don't know

86
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,779
Are you guys ready?

87
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,480
Are you ready for the first one? We've got the gorilla

88
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,600
And this is by this is a horror

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,399
Comedy movie by the ritz brothers

90
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You don't know who the ritz brothers are

91
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:02,600
They're the three stooges, but they're not the three stooges. They're just three guys that like let's get out of here

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
And they hit each other in the head with stuff

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Uh, it was pretty popular at the time

94
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,610
Like the the three guys hit each other in the head with hammers and punch each other in the nose and pinch each other's ears

95
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,529
was

96
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,290
the fortnight youtuber

97
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,490
You know what I mean? There's a lot of them. It was a lot of them like back in like the the 30s

98
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,329
This was like the youtuber. This was like the influencer. They just like the fortnight guy

99
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:44,740
So you're like wait, well, how come there's so many three stooges copies you tell me not this again

100
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,699
That's a plus two hot take no, it's not that's just what do you want to say?

101
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,180
It's like the most popular game and everybody plays it

102
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,990
I don't play it though because i'm fucking I do stuff. I do stuff. I do different. I do stuff different

103
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,870
I don't play fortnight because I just I do things different

104
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,310
Right, uh 50 dollars just came in

105
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,550
from brooding

106
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,310
high rope tarot

107
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,620
It's 5 000 bits. Thank you

108
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,689
Hi, jerma. I'm sorry. My last donation was worded so badly

109
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,810
I didn't mean for it to sound like that. The dream was that you were streaming but also chat could talk on stream

110
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:28,170
And kim was making fun of me for being louder than you and that people couldn't hear you

111
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,889
Anyways, thanks for being such a funny guy. I've been going through a shitty time recently and having a laugh helps

112
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,929
Can we watch the jimmy neutron movie? That would be illegal

113
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,889
Jimmy neutron is currently owned by believe viacom and they keep coming out with stuff and it's not in public domain

114
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,419
I would get a lot of trouble. I would get sued. We're going with non-sued movies

115
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Not in public domain. It's unfortunate

116
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,779
Maybe in 75 years when it goes into public domain, we'll we'll watch it. But yeah, I don't know my like grandson like german

117
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,460
German jr. German jr. Nine eight five when he's streaming in a hundred years

118
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:15,909
Uh, you guys can watch that together. It'll be in public domain by then but thanks for the 50 dollars a lot of money

119
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:22,090
And with that, uh, why don't we get started? I'm ready. How can you be ready? But I am

120
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,059
um, so I

121
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,460
I

122
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,820
So I can't skip at all at all

123
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,450
Okay

124
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:51,899
All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Here we go. There comes the gorilla starring the ritz brothers. Wait, we're gonna get like a

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,399
countdown

126
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,700
free

127
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:33,269
All right. Shh. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Thx. There is thx sound. I'm so excited

128
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:50,250
Oh the rich brothers the three goofballs, it's too loud

129
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,789
Show your face

130
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:03,190
No, when you watch a movie the guy's face isn't down in the corner. That's not how this works

131
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,289
I'm not part of the movie

132
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:20,419
Hey ten community subs. Thanks snake cowboy for the tens up. All right charge. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet

133
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,179
We got to invert. Oh, hey, you know, don't skip immerse us in the movie, but please put a face cam 40 percent of the screen

134
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,940
You're a maniac

135
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Murderer terrorizes suburb

136
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,440
There he is

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,919
Is that supposed to be a real is a real gorilla at least baffled as the gorilla strikes again

138
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,419
Maniac murderer claims another victim. Is it just the zoo? Did he get out of the zoo?

139
00:11:48,220 --> 00:12:02,149
Let's just turn stricken as murderer makes good his threat. How hard is it to catch a gorilla?

140
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:32,169
Why is he like reaching behind a desk to try to find dropped keys?

141
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,419
Parting is such sweet sorrow

142
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,940
That I shall say good night till it be morrow

143
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
Oh, I also read romeo and julia

144
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,669
Good night

145
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,669
Parting is such sweet sorrow

146
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,330
That I should say good night

147
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,610
Till it be morrow. Why are you praying to romeo and juliet?

148
00:12:54,009 --> 00:13:01,820
Just put a note on her

149
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
c4

150
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,399
He just has a hitman costume on it's 47

151
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:42,899
Pick up a weapon, why don't you take the note off and just see what it says

152
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Wait, this is well kiddy

153
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,070
What is all this racket about?

154
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,309
Oh

155
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,000
I saw him. I saw him. He's here in this house. The gorilla

156
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,750
You have been dreaming. Oh, no, what's that? I don't know. I'm telling you. I don't know anything

157
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,490
Why is he fully dressed is he sleeping a suit

158
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:36,700
You're hysterical. Oh, no, anything is just you go back to bed. That's what I said, sir. Only there is this

159
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,190
Uh-oh walter stevens. You are next to die

160
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,340
gorillas

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,039
That didn't take very long. You didn't even do individual letters. You fucking hack should I call the police, sir?

162
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,029
Please. Yes. Yes call them right away

163
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,610
Just a minute panel. This is my own way. Yes, sir. Only but it's a gorilla what I was thinking of the time, sir

164
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,129
Time according to the newspapers the gorilla gives his victim only 24 hours notice

165
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,769
I mean only what?

166
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,419
Oh nonsense. Now you go back to bed and don't why is the amazon prime? I don't understand. Oh, don't go back to bed

167
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,139
I'm not particularly interested. Where you go. Oh, well, mr. Stevens

168
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,419
Gorilla prime

169
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,279
Come please

170
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,220
That'll be all. Yes, sir. Yeah, but I wouldn't be frightened like that if I were you kiddy

171
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,860
Look you'll be frightened any way you want. This is mine, too

172
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,129
I want those big huge fucking cabinet doors. Hello

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I begged you not to telephone me here

174
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,799
Yes, I know I promised but

175
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,799
You gave me until monday

176
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,000
saturday

177
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,559
Tomorrow that's a debt collector. That's impossible

178
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,519
I can't possibly raise that amount of money

179
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,429
Yes, I know I owe it to you but a quarter of a million dollars

180
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,629
Be reasonable

181
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:18,419
Now, please be patient

182
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,019
I have a plan

183
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,820
But it's only just started give me time to work it out and i'll repay you dollar for dollar

184
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,220
If you don't repay do they send the gorilla after you?

185
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:36,919
It's kind of fucked up

186
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,620
Behind you quick turn around

187
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,710
It's bugleberry

188
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:53,179
I want to send a radiogram, please

189
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,799
Miss norma denby dears in denver aboard ss paris

190
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Regret unable to meet you at boat

191
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,339

192
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,500

Uncle walter make sure you put smork on read that back, please

196
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:38,569
Rain was so hard to do back in like the 40s

197
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,339
I didn't even invent rain rain wasn't even invented until the fucking 60s

198
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm norma denby

199
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Welcome to our fuckface

200
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,250
Stevens is expecting you miss denby

201
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,599
May I take your coat? Oh, no. Thank you. I'll keep it on

202
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,130
Who is this person by the way place your uncle has here he likes it

203
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,329
You have to live in it this way, please

204
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,740
Huge cabinet doors. I love them. Well, well, well if it isn't the prodigal niece

205
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:30,579
I'll see you again darling. Is that her stepping down dear? She weighed like five metric tons. Good. I'm glad you did

206
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,579
This is jack uncle walter

207
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,259
This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent what few letters she did write though were full of you

208
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,460
Congratulations young man. Thank you. And I hope you'll excuse me for barging in like this nonsense. I'm delighted

209
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,740
I was more than personally surprised to hear that you set your marriage for dune

210
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,059
Do you realize it's only a month away? Well, we decided we didn't want to rush things too much. So oh we put it off until

211
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,299
the day after tomorrow

212
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,019
The day after tomorrow

213
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,700
Soon

214
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,819
Hi

215
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,819
I know no, that's fine

216
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,059
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about

217
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,579
But i'm forgetting my role as host sit down my dear sit down

218
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,349
We may as well come to the point

219
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:16,869
I can't get this suit on to talk to norma alone. Mr. Stevenson. Oh, no. No, it's airtight. Help me as norma's future husband

220
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,509
What I have to say concerns you too

221
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,910
now as norma knows

222
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,029
She and I were named joint heirs under the terms of her father's will

223
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,029
And until she marries i'm the executive of her estate

224
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:34,309
But should anything happen to either of us by then the survivor inherited the entire estate

225
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,750
And I think that you norma and you jack as her future husband should know of what that estate consists

226
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,509
to that end

227
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,509
I prepared a record of the estate's holdings

228
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,230
And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner

229
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,190
But your radiogram said there was something urgent the fire feels so good. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be that close

230
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,109
Urgent I

231
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,789
I wouldn't have sent it

232
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:59,190
Something's worrying you what is it? Uncle walder? Well, perhaps i'm unduly alarmed but

233
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,269
Last night I received the black and white boomer face

234
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,309
From the gorilla

235
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:12,089
The gorilla you mean that murderer the one the papers have been so full of I do

236
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,450
What the fuck but isn't it possible that this is all just a joke that someone's playing a prank on you?

237
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,450
I wish I could think so

238
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,329
But uncle walder why should he just tell him that you owe a quarter of a million dollars to the fucking irs

239
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,490
Whatever it is possible some old enemy of mine

240
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,730
I admit I made enemies in my day

241
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,890
It's possible that one of them in the spirit of revenge has hired this this maniac this

242
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:38,329
Professional killer or whatever the gorilla is this note is exactly like the one that was in newspapers

243
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,809
After you murdered that widow

244
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,890
Still I can't bring myself to believe it

245
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Of course, you've notified the police

246
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:52,619
No, I haven't but surely if there was anything they never do I've taken other precautions peters and I are armed

247
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,980
And in addition i've engaged the services of a private detective agency

248
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,980
Their operative should be here any moment now. Oh, of course not. I didn't call the police

249
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,299
I called three comedy dickheads that are going to bumble around and break stuff

250
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:09,900
And probably blow up the microwaves successes. It is apparent the workings of the police were an open book to him

251
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,740
Of course, it's a slim chance that by not notifying the police. We might upset his plans

252
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,299
ordinarily i'm not easily frightened, but

253
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,980
I must admit this whole affair is giving me the creeps. Well, it's nearly nine o'clock. I suppose you freshen up a bit

254
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,539
We talk it over after dinner

255
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,210
I thought about craigslist

256
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,589
Oh kitty

257
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,069
Show me some damage to the green room. Mr. Marsden to my room. Yes, sir. Don't worry uncle

258
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:41,019
Oh, excuse me, mr stevens

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,940
Yes, kitty. Oh, I know it's no no black and white face game. You're not trying to tell me you're gonna leave me

260
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,019
Oh, no, sir. I'm trying to tell you I have left you but kitty. You're perfectly safe here

261
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:54,460
What besides we have guests you haven't the heart to leave me now

262
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:59,579
Well, my heart is willing but i'm gonna have an awful time trying to convince the rest of my body

263
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,670
Whoopsie we just drove into somebody hack me detective agency

264
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:19,740
Don't call the police call it with three toddlers

265
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,400
I

266
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,529
What's the joke here

267
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,289
He can see through it

268
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,650
I'll bet there's a dead body in every room. That body won't hurt you

269
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,210
Can't do you any good. It's of rain. I get it. Well, what are we waiting for?

270
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,650
All right, who's gonna slip in the water? Someone's gonna slip and fall in the rain slip in the puddle step out and slip in the water

271
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,690
You get my reference tonight chief make it out of there. Uh, keep doing that once in a while. It keeps me on edge

272
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,490
I'm thinking come on good slip in the water. Now. What are you supposed to want to take this boy? I've got an idea

273
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,890
Uh, let's go in and find out you're terrific

274
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,670
We're joints are speakeasy

275
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,910
I love it. I love it so far

276
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:23,000
Me why i'm peter, sir, never mind that never mind that what's your name peter, sir

277
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,880
Hey, just a minute. Just a minute. Where were you last night? I beg you pardon

278
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, so you did do something. I don't like your looks. What's that got to do with it? This is no beauty contest

279
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:44,490
I just had to flick a cigarette into the car's casket. I can't even man. I keep thinking of the fucking stupid

280
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,650
kramer

281
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:57,480
The gun no stevens. I am i'm harrigan. I'm mulligan. I'm garrity harrigan mulligan

282
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:01,019
garrity

283
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,700
I assume for you because I mean what you call yourself. I'll tell you what now tell me any clues one very vital one

284
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:11,579
This warning from the gorilla. That's where you've got nothing to worry about mark that down garrity, right?

285
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,420
How do you spell gorilla two r's or two l's gorilla? I don't know

286
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,619
g o r two l's g g o

287
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,099
Did you did you

288
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,980
Did you say gorilla?

289
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,859
My gentleman is not afraid

290
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,299
Thank you the gorilla coming here, why is it scarier than a fucking murderer?

291
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:46,299
Quiet oh did you did you say an animal? Uh, just an animal like a wild animal versus a murderer with motive

292
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,299
Every door and window is securely bolted. I couldn't have done better myself with us on the job. Mr. Stevens

293
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,099
You've got nothing to worry about what's your plan? Mr. Harrigan? Well, first, we'll take a look around the house. Come on, man

294
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:02,400
Now you just sit tight. Mr. Stevens. The gorilla will get you over our dead bodies

295
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,359
All right

296
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,380
It really is the threes to just just more articulate

297
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,329
Probably the detectives your uncle hired

298
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:26,769
Jack i'm terribly worried. What are we going to do? Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet

299
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:34,049
Listen darling. It isn't that i'm trying to appear skeptical. It's just that well somehow I can't make myself believe all this

300
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:37,730
But that note you saw the note, of course I did but still I

301
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:45,890
Look darling, we'll wait. We'll wait and see if something really does happen three redditors. I just don't believe it. Well

302
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:49,650
Jack

303
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:55,950
What's that?

304
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,430
That's the gorilla like me. It has to be excuse me, sir

305
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:04,430
Yeah, I tried to put your car away, but unfortunately there's something wrong with it. What do you mean?

306
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:06,750
It won't start

307
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,079
Excuse me, sir

308
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,420
He gives me the creeps he doesn't exactly give me enough no, that's the red herring

309
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,859
That's the red herring. It's not him

310
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,420
Don't you think there's any cause for alarm? I'm afraid I don't

311
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:34,349
Thank you, no

312
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:43,710
But I will uh smoke all of your cigarettes. In fact, how many do you have?

313
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,190
I'm fucking scared. We just saw his face

314
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,960
Not very long. Why well, are you sure he's all right? I found him. So why?

315
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Well, because I

316
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,259
Dinner is served, sir

317
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:06,259
Oh, shall we go in?

318
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,319
You would notice that you would know that was happening why can you hear them?

319
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,750
Oh here take it but my nerves really need is a good long trip

320
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:35,390
Yeah, okay, where were you last night me why I answer yes or no

321
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:39,869
What are you doing there doing? Where well, how do we know besides?

322
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,549
I don't like your looks. Did you ever take a good look at yourself? Yeah, did you ever take a look?

323
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:51,069
Hey now, wait a minute you where were you last night? I spent the night with shakespeare. Yeah, where is he? He's dead

324
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,910
A minor mystery

325
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,670
Have you any idea who did it? Look shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years

326
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,190
Hundreds. This is a fine time to call us in on the case

327
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:06,829
Say but she couldn't have done it. How do you know she can't be hundreds of years old?

328
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,230
That's right mark that down garrity

329
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,109
You two have a look out there i'll look here. Yeah

330
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:16,109
Come on break the sink enough water get all over you

331
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:32,130
What's this that's a door at least to the back stairs back stairs well remind me to have a look up there sometime

332
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,619
Boomer humor

333
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,890
That's an ironing board

334
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:49,500
Do you want this thing certainly we want it. What do you think we are you're not? Yeah

335
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,579
Well here take it

336
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,299
We found it what a psycho

337
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:03,740
Well, that's hash. Ain't that a mystery some pretty good tidy chief. I'll be the judge of that

338
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,099
I'm afraid gentlemen, you won't find the gorilla in there

339
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:13,579
There why will we not find the gorilla in there now listen you

340
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:27,519
Shit let that be a lesson to you perhaps you gentlemen had better look outside for

341
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:40,750
WWE how do you get out of here? That's what i'd like to know and where's the back door and back

342
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:44,369
Do the iron again, come on

343
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,420
I knew it was gonna i'm I think it's funny recall that the paper said the girl always sends a warning to as many as half a

344
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,980
Dozen people unironically laughing at this because it's just so stupid. Maybe that's what he's doing now

345
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:01,940
Perhaps it's just a ruse. Well, let's hope so

346
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,539
You know, it's wonderful how much more optimistic a good dinner can make one feel

347
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:09,700
Shall we have liquors in the study smoking at the table at dinner?

348
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,819
Oh

349
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:29,920
The lights off well the lights off I know no what happened look here it seems to have been thrown in through that window

350
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:35,009
12 hours. Oh shit

351
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:40,829
What are we going to do the first thing we're going to do or rather jack is going to do

352
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,109
Is to take you away from here when you're coming with us

353
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
It's him

354
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,859
Uncle waldo

355
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,380
Who is it?

356
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,079
Uh, no. No, he's making a handful of e-boat faces. It could be anybody

357
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
He did give me a turn

358
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,630
Do you see that face? I bet when he gets drunk snakes see him

359
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
I'm just trying to let you know i'm not the gorilla

360
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,559
Please the stem be of her Beyonce, mr. Marsden

361
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
harrigan mulligan and

362
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,880
guarantee

363
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
This battle seems to be much more serious than I thought

364
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,519
I've just received this from the gorilla

365
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,880
I know who brought it. No one brought it

366
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,599
To throw me through that window

367
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,400
He's right, this is my good ear

368
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,619
That was good cat. Oh say that's right. You can't kid us. We're outside patrolling the grounds. What do you mean?

369
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:56,980
By the note couldn't have come through that window. But why not? Well, i'll just show you stand back, man

370
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,940
That's why

371
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,420
But it was wrapped around the stone a stone a stone. Oh, why didn't you say so?

372
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,579
Anyway, what do you know about this thing?

373
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,099
Well, I don't know anything about it

374
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:14,619
We were preparing to leave the room and suddenly the lights went out and then there was a crash and oh so the lights went out

375
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Make a note of that garrity, right?

376
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,700
You're outside a few minutes ago. Didn't you see anybody? Nobody but us

377
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,940
Take a note of that gary

378
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:29,900
Midnight. Yeah, what time is it now? It's 10 30. I got 11 10. I got 11 30. It's exactly 11 45

379
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,180
Remind me to put some hands on this watch. Yes. Well make a note of that garrity, right now

380
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:40,059
Look, the gorilla's after stevens. We'll have to keep an eye on him everybody into the study. Come on. Let's go

381
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,539
Uh, who said that? I wonder if anybody dies rope. He'll hang himself you chief. Oh, that's where I heard it before

382
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,029
Is the gorilla

383
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:04,109
Oh

00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:14,819
Smash some stuff. Come on, you know you want to

385
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
This is a guy in a gorilla suit

386
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,410
Is it no, it's not a real gorilla

387
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,970
I don't know. I don't know where that was supposed to be

388
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,509
That's somebody's basement

389
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:49,660
That was a real ape. No, it wasn't that was like

390
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:55,500
That scared the fucking shit out of me. God damn boomer jump scares lightning in every movie

391
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:18,099
Now that you're all here, yes, but come right back quiet personally, I don't believe the gorillas coming here neither do I

392
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,219
Why not?

393
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,980
Reasons pal harrigan mulligan and garrity. It ain't enough

394
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:28,579
Now look here

395
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,039
Oh should have 5g tower have received the gorillas warning walter stevens. You've just five minutes to live

396
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
Oh, what jack?

397
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,719
Excuse me

398
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,599
Here now, where are you going? I'm getting out of here. There's no door there. Oh, that's all right. I'll make one. Goodbye

399
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,539
Quiet quiet everybody who's even talking

400
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,280
They're all kramer

401
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,760
All of them. They're all they're all castanza and kramer combined into one person

402
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,969
Did you hear that? I wish I didn't

403
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,590
He's up there man. Why are you gone? I said he's up there. That's what I thought you said

404
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,969
Classic absolutely classic

405
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:39,099
It's mr. X

406
00:35:39,099 --> 00:36:01,920
Is it the gorilla?

407
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:16,320
Nothing at all. What did he just double barrel shotgun kill something down there? That was like a I shot something with a shotgun sound

408
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,769
Hey

409
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,010
Did you just pass here?

410
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,579
Yes

411
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:29,619
Yes, of course. I brought a trunk down from the attic a trunk. Yes. Were we here?

412
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
I couldn't say

413
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,579
Well, maybe we're not here now

414
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,039
Maybe

415
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,039
Maybe wait, is he the gorilla?

416
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:46,449
It's two minutes of 12. What about uncle walter? Uncle walter. Yes, uncle walter. We're uncle. We're just going in

417
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,650
Now everybody

418
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,320
Stay just don't get him in there. You watch that one

419
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,719
You've got nothing to worry about I wish I thought so me too

420
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,139
You have one more minute walter stevens

421
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:27,789
If this is an elaborate birthday prank i'm gonna be really upset at this movie happy birthday mr. Stevens

422
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:36,289
Someone's gonna die

423
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:43,969
I can't stand any longer. I can't you've got to call. Please. You've got to mr. Stevens. I'm sorry, but norm is right

424
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,980
I don't know what this is all about. But certainly if there's something to it, the police ought to know about it

425
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,139
I no longer know what to think

426
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,820
Perhaps you'd better

427
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,860
Hello

428
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,219
Hello

429
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:58,849
Lines cut

430
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:27,170
Oh just open the door the butler just came in he wasn't in the

431
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,889
See, how did you get in here? Why through this door, sir? How can you when the doors are locked?

432
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,690
I beg your pardon. It was not locked. I locked it myself

433
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:42,050
It is locked that leaves us dead locked. It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork. Why termites do

434
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:47,340
Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere. Now leave everything to me. The gorilla ain't gonna make monkey out of me

435
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Now you

436
00:38:54,059 --> 00:39:01,090
But who could

437
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,650
Turning into clue

438
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,130
Well, what are you waiting for? I don't know but I wish I could think of something me too. I'll go on

439
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,630
Don't worry darling. Oh, that's all right. I'll do all the work marston come with me

440
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,929
But they keep separating it you first, sir

441
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:35,969
Thank you very much. He's waving that gun around like

442
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,610
Point that thing down

443
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,460
Right from under our very eyes, I don't understand how he got out of here. Oh no

444
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:59,389
He's gonna kill her

445
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:05,469
What was that

446
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:15,340
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination not unless a hallucination has hair on it come on

447
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,900
Oh, they can they can

448
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,460
That's obviously the gorilla

449
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,219
Who is he?

450
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:31,260
I've never seen him before. Do you know him? No, sir. And this is no time for no introductions

451
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,179
He's not dead. Yeah mark that down too. Come on darling. We're getting out of here. I'm afraid now too for you

452
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,739
It's him

453
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:44,780
Oh jack, it's horrible. I don't know what to make of it. Now all I can say is around here somewhere

454
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:51,019
I know mr stevens is around here somewhere and if you all look we'll find him somewhere. Where are you going somewhere?

455
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,579
Yes, there it is upstairs. Come on garrity you lead the way

456
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,000
They said he's not dead

457
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:12,210
A hillary clinton statue over there something funny about this was that kitty said she saw the gorilla's arm

458
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,090
We open the closet and find the sailor's body now

459
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,449
How did the body get in there and how did the gorilla get out without our seeing him?

460
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,690
That's just what I was about to ask you

461
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,820
Stevens was sitting right here in this chair until the lights went out

462
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,670
Gorilla, what is this? What is this a jervis dream?

463
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:41,949
What's funny? Nothing. I think i'll have a look around this house. Have a look around the house. Yes, I have have a look around the house

464
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:43,550
Yeah

465
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,550
I'll go too. Yes, it is. Yeah, you're right

466
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:50,670
Hey that guy won't talk. Why not? He's still unconscious. You're unconscious and you talk

467
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:55,230
That's great chief mark that down garrity. Right. What do we do now? Well, first we'll have to

468
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:59,789
I love these guys. Well, how do we do that? Now? Let's see when the lights went out. Stevens was sitting in that chair

469
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:04,030
You're steven sit down. I'm steven mulligan close the doors

470
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,340
I'm garrity you're stevens now sit down. I'll wait for lights

471
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
One oh, they're gonna find it out two

472
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,219
three

473
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:22,219
Ah, it's no use

474
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,619
I don't know. It works for sure like homes

475
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,099
I don't know why it wouldn't work for me

476
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,780
That's what i'm trying to tell you. He's gone. Is he gone?

477
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,099
garrity

478
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:35,619
garrity

479
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:40,900
Now we have two mysteries to solve. Let's i've got an idea. What is it? If we can find out how garrity disappeared

480
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:46,019
We'll find out what happened to stevens. You sit in that chair now. Should have thought of that myself. They're all gonna sit in the chair

481
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,139
You have to be tired to sit down I do

482
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,659
You make me tired well, and why don't you sit down if I sit down who's gonna work the lights

487
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,880
After one you'll sit down and like it. Oh, all right. I'll sit down but I won't like it. Yep

488
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,639
This guy's just fucking electric chairing everybody

489
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,190
Well, it's just what I want to find out

490
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:59,519
Killing everybody one two two two two two

491

Three

492
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,170
What a pity

493
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:24,400
The killer

494
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:50,719
Wait, is this a scam the whole time?

495
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:18,159
Wait a minute. I

496
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,800
So where did the three uh ritz brothers go?

497
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,380
Is he taking them out? Is everybody outside?

498
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,639
So he just puts them in the closet

499
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,510
Hey, what's the matter? What's happening? Oh, look i'm standing here

500
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:55,949
And all of a sudden everything goes black

501
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,590
next thing I know

502
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,590
I'm here. That's funny

503
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:03,469
Hello

00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:08,989
Hello, i'm sorry. I kept you waiting. No. No you turn on willow dry. You're not gonna question who this person is

505
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,059
Thank you. Look it ain't human. I'll tell you it ain't human

506
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,940
What isn't human?

507
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:23,900
For a guy to be standing here one minute and the next minute he's gone. Who's gone? I'm gone. They're gone

508
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,579
Everybody's gone. It don't make sense. Certainly doesn't will you have a cigarette? I don't mind if I do

509
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,179
He kidnapped me right from under his very eyes. Who does the gorilla?

510
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,949
Hey

511
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:46,190
Who are you? Watch that match. It's gonna hurt. What do you want? What are you doing here?

512
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:52,110
Listen old man, you got me all wrong. I just came in to use the telephone. You see my car broke down that phone

513
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:56,909
Look, that phone is out of order. Is it? Yes

514
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:07,230
Well, if you'll excuse me i'll be on my way you bastard you pranked me you

515
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:14,349
You're the gorilla surely you don't think i'm the gorilla. I stopped thinking two hours ago, but you don't understand. I don't have to understand

516
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:19,550
Shall I try it? Oh you've tried enough now get him up. Listen, you're making a big mistake

517
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,710
Well, it won't be the first time

518
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,670
What the fuck just happened?

519
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,860
Did he just like did he just kick him in the balls?

520
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:36,500
What just happened?

521
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
What just happened? Oh

522
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,739
All right. All right. I got your club

523
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,340
Okay, shake him up shake him up

524
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,659
Wait the safe

525
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:54,659
The safe is always behind the picture

526
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,789
Oh shit, he knows the secret passages

527
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:08,940
Help help me

528
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:15,389
For a second, I thought that was the guy that just left for the secret passage. I was like what the he just took his hat off

529
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:22,349
Get it right there. Oh, it was terrible the gorilla the gorilla. Why did you get all tied up like this the gorilla?

530
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:25,710
I tell you it wasn't my fault. He came in and hit me. It was

531
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Did I leave it in there?

532
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:33,150
Everybody's in that closet. That's like that's the hitman's storage closet

533
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:39,139
Oh

534
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,739
You tell me what are you doing with those things on this is what happens when the npcs wake up when you leave the level

535
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, you start to use that phone and get very far not with me on the job lucky thing for him

536
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,159
You had your handcuffs with you. Where is he? Where'd he go? Where is he? I'm the victim. How should I know?

537
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,719
Look boys. I'm telling you walked in six of them six big gorillas. They attacked me six right on my crow

538
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,320
He's making that up. Yeah, look at this one. Look right there

539
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,840
These windows are locked from the inside

540
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:16,619
Six of them not kidding kidding with the gorilla right under my nose and a ten thousand dollar reward. He says i'm kidding

541
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,849
Well, are you?

542
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:24,050
Who belongs to this? That's like a million dollars, by the way. Why gorillas don't wear coats. Sure. They do fur coats

543
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,929
Something screwy about all this

544
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:30,050
There's anything screwy about this. It's me

545
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:35,170
It's me, but i'll soon find out each of you grab a wall. What do we do with it?

546
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,449
You take that one

00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:42,929
I'm, I think it's funny. Whatever. It's fucking stupid grab a wall

548
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:51,219
I'll take it easy. I'll tap each one of you. See if you can find some trap doors

549
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,559
Didn't he see the bookcase open?

550
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
I thought he saw this happen

551
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:06,480
Must be out there. Come on, man right out here

552
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:23,469
Who's yelling for help? Right? Right? Right? I cover the door man. That's right. Who are you never mind?

553
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:29,380
New characters being introduced late in the game here

554
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,789
What do you think I didn't come here to play games?

555
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:39,070
I want to see walter stevens and want to see him right now, but you don't understand. These gentlemen are detectives detectives

556
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,309
What are you trying to pull on me? I talked to stevens on the telephone last night

557
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:47,949
He told me he had a plan to pay his debt plan. Yeah said he'd only just started working on it

558
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:53,550
But did he tell you what this plan is? I wasn't interested. He was to square up with me here tonight

559
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:58,670
Quarter of a million dollars. That's a lot of money for 1939. He owes me now. Where is he?

560
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:01,469
Mr steven's been kidnapped by the gorilla kidnapped by

561
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:09,300
Poppycock look here. I don't know who any of you are, but I do know this walter stevens owes me

562
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,179
$250,000 and i'm going to collect it tonight or else

563
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,019
That's a pretty good wwf promo pointing

564
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:24,019
I'm one of stevens clark. I'm gonna get out there and i'm gonna fucking bury hulk hogan into the ground for over a year

565
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:31,199
I gave him until tonight to return my money and until I get it. Yeah, but wait a minute

566
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,340
I think he's mad jack if what that man says is true

567
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:40,179
I

568
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:44,980
I don't believe uncle walter could it's almost impossible to know what to believe darling yet things are adding up

569
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,539
If your uncle did have a plan

570
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,900
If this business of sending for you was part of something mean gene

571
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,579
This is going far enough. It's going too far. It's even going further than that. I'll be all right

572
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,019
Just too much excitement for one night get your hat and coat darling

573
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:02,820
I'm gonna see that you get to town if I have to push the car all the way myself

00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,980
I can't go till we find uncle walter. We'll take you're not strong enough to do that money boys. I have to crush your ego here

575
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:12,110
Like it was walnuts

576
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,710
He's a simp

577
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:19,469
You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl. Yeah, what about poor us strange men zooming in and out animals running around?

578
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,550
Like this was a zoo crazy gongs on I want to go home. I'll say you want to go home

579
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:28,030
I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of you. Do you want to take a run out part?

580
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,030
We'll leave that girl here to take the blame alone

581
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,429
We detectives aren't we are we?

582
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,909
Haven't we looked all over this house? Yes. No, where haven't we looked? Well, if there's a cello we haven't looked there

583
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,349
I'm glad I thought of that say this looks like a cello. Well

584
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:48,429
One fucking door we ever looked at the key. Oh, yes never thought of that

585
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:58,909
All right, come on man

586
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,099
What the fuck is the gorilla? I don't understand the whole why is this movie called the gorilla?

587
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,420
He was just in a cage

588
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,530
But is he gonna sell the gorilla to him for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?

589
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:14,460
Is that the plan?

590
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:38,429
All right. Come on out there you come on. That's some silent hill shit right there. All right. I'm right here chief

591
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,940
Turn on your radio. Are you is it making weird sounds?

592
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:54,179
Is anybody with me? No, you're alone. Yeah

593
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:15,789
Takes work to do that

594
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:26,639
First time I saw a mousetrap catch a piece of cheese

595
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,610
Why they're not scared

596
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,789
We've been double crossed oh it's superman

597
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,550
Yeah

598
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,550
Bending the metal rod

599
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:33,010
Oh, no, that's a support beam. Don't do that

600
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:43,280
Why would you show your strength?

601
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,559
That's so funny

602
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,559
Peters. Yes, sir. It's all that commotion

603
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,360
Sounds like our friends the detectives you stay here with miss denby. I'll go see what's up

604
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,239
the real gorilla

605
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:00,639
No, no, thank you

606
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:13,429
I'm drinking his poison

607
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:21,000
Uh, what the hell is he doing if there are plenty ways to do this without making like a scary face

608
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,719
You know like hey, do you want your coat?

609
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
Instead of leaning in with your mouth open

610
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:35,269
I can hear him breathe. That's you. Oh, well open it open it. Here comes a suit of armor joke. Definitely

611
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:41,639
Have you men been drinking? No, but it's a good idea

612
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,309
I don't know

613
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:55,110
Oh, there's two gorillas

614
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,110
There's two gorillas without a doubt

615
00:56:57,349 --> 00:57:13,409
A couple you can thank goodness. You caught her

616
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,909
You heard him mulligan. So did you? Well, never mind that you take the hall. I'll go this way

617
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,159
I'll stay here

618
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,449
Is something wrong where were you I just went to get some tea, sir

619
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:35,010
Didn't I tell you to stay here with miss denby? I'm very sorry, sir, but I thought perhaps a little tea

620
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:38,050
What right are you got to think we're not even thinking

621
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:43,969
Miss denby might have been killed. It's uh fortunate. She wasn't sir. This guy's too calm

622
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,530
I don't trust him. Something always happens when you're not here

623
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,809
An unfortunate coincidence, sir

624
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,130
What did you find an empty closet with harry give him it

625
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,489
Harry harry wake up get up wake up

626
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:09,329
Did you get him? Did you get him? No, he got you. Well, it won't happen again. Okay, man

627
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,570
No, he got you that's pretty good

628
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:19,909
Get down and see where these stairs lead to

629
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:24,230
Yes, you oh me voice crack voice crack

630
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:34,070
What's that funny tapping it's my knees it's a fine time to be scared you try and think of a better time

631
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
This is back in the day when you had to do it for real

00:58:55,059 --> 00:59:02,849
I'm going in there and we'll look over this house. You'll take orders from me because the show down

You fellas stick close behind me

635
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:13,719
Anything happens leave it to me

636
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:23,989
I'm gonna tear this house apart. I'll show this mug. Who's a mug

637
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:26,789
You fellas stick close behind me

638
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,110
Anything happens leave it to me

639
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,199
Why is he watching

640
00:59:43,320 --> 01:00:02,960
He's a guy like pointed shit what's eating you he must know something unless you wouldn't be running away like that

641
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,199
Making all of that gaudy

642
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,199
Oh

643
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:37,510
YouTuber noises

644
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:43,519
Gonna kill him with an umbrella. That's not gonna work. Now. Here's a random guy that's still in the movie somehow

645
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,530
Where's he been? He's been hiding inside the walls

646
01:00:47,409 --> 01:01:00,840
Nothing to worry about that's what you think. May I give you some advice? No

647
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:05,880
If I were you i'd go to my room and stay there. Oh, yes, sir. I was just planning on that

648
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,679
Wait a minute. What have you been? No place honest, sir. I was just getting ready to go to town

649
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:17,329
Why not the gorilla he's in there don't be silly. He's gonna throw him out the window

650
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,639
God, I hope the gorilla throws this guy out the window

651
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:25,039
Get going. Yes, sir. I'm practically there

652
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,940
I want to see the gorilla do at least one full haymaker punch into somebody's face, right?

653
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,940
Like I mean we have to see it, please

654
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:43,829
Or suplex. Yeah, anything a wrestling move. I'll take a frying pan like the gorilla hits somebody with a frying pan, please

655
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,460
Or somebody hits the gorilla in the face of the frying pan and it doesn't affect him and it's like oh

656
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,780
That didn't work and they get all panicked

657
01:01:54,019 --> 01:02:15,329
I'll take that

658
01:02:15,329 --> 01:02:18,769
It's a gorilla. We saw it and we felt it and I tell you the gorilla is a man

659
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:22,769
I ought to know i've read enough about him. But how could a monkey have possibly written those notes?

660
01:02:22,769 --> 01:02:25,809
Tucker walter, maybe it's got an education umbrella joke

661
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:34,079
Oh, where is he? Have any of you seen him? Oh poe who's poe poe's the gorilla the gorilla

662
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,039
Oh, you know him too, huh? No, I train him since he was that high

663
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,880
You're just the one we're looking for don't any of you understand poe is a gorilla a twain gorilla a real gorilla

664
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,559
Sure a real gorilla

665
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,480
Uh, so we don't know what we're talking about. Eh, yeah, we know a monkey when we see one

666
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:53,039
Listen, this is serious poe ain't no pet. There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around

667
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,280
He's trained he hates women. Well, what's he doing here? What are you doing here?

668
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,599
We was hired to come here. We're working at the county fair yesterday. A guy comes along

669
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,760
He says he wants me to bring poe here. He says he's given a party wants us to put on a wreck

670
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,400
Who hired you? I don't know. I don't know all I know here

671
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,360
We're waiting out in the garage like he tells me waiting to do our stuff

672
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,719
All of a sudden somebody gives me a clunk over the head and I wake up the lady's boudoir

673
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,239
But the gorilla how did he get loose? You're asking me? That's what I want to find out

674
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,840
Listen, this is serious. We gotta find him. We got us somebody's liable to get killed then notes from the gorilla

675
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,239
I told this too

676
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,079
Notes poe can't write no notes. Even I don't know how to write now

677
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,320
Look the next time I buck up against that gorilla i'm telling you i'll hit i'll dwell

678
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:44,000
I'll you'll never know he'll do it. Listen, have you seen him? Yes. She's in the kitchen. Which way is the kitchen through the panel?

679
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,480
We'll go with you

680
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,949
You fellas better wait here there's no telling what that able do

681
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,550
Jack

682
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:58,230
I'm so confused a real gorilla and those notes and

683
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:05,320
Listen to me everybody the gorilla has done his work

684
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,920
Walter stevens is dead. You will find his body in the garage. Oh jack

685
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,000
All right, everybody follow me to the garage. Come on

686
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:22,869
Doesn't sound very enthusiastic about it. You'll find his body in the garage

687
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:35,989
I also for lunch today will be salisbury steak. Stay here and protect miss dandy this way, please

688
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,079
We need the big reveal police with us around lady. You couldn't we couldn't

689
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,719
That's right, we didn't

690
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:55,329
I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and out of here

691
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,719
It must be a secret spring around here someplace

692
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:01,679
I think i'll look in the back of these books

693
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:04,769
He's gonna get grabbed. He's gonna he's gonna pull the right one

694
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,250
And he's gonna go

695
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:11,219
Yeah

696
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:25,809
Imagine getting hit in the head with a fucking brass statue as hard as somebody could do it

697
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,969
Just turned him into a goofball for five seconds

698
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:50,849
He's dead the walk the germo walk

699
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:56,949
All right, see this two gorillas here we go flash up the here comes the gorillas

700
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:07,250
It's a guy with a gorilla arm, it's gonna be a scooby-doo bullshit

701
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:21,320
Don't tell me she's the gorilla. I told you I didn't like them keys. Look under the mat. That's funny

702
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,480
Oh, very funny

703
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:29,760
Will you get listen? What are you doing at poe's cage? What do you think i'm doing waiting for someone to feed me peanuts?

704
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:37,510
Don't you know paul hates women sodas kipling. So what will you please get me out of here?

705
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,230
Hold on. Wait, what?

706
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:48,260
How about the other poe that hates women say wait a minute, I think this was a trick to get us out of the house

707
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,309
Come on

708
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:01,670
Whoa, what holy shit

709
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:23,590
Is he holding this lady

710
01:07:46,239 --> 01:08:05,840
How do you catch a gorilla like that, oh no, he made it in he knows he's the fake gorilla

711
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,949
Break through you can do it

712
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:24,130
No, the gorilla was the good guy all along. Thank you. Oh, he hid me a gift right here

713
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:34,529
That's an anti-hero gorilla

714
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:40,289
You act like that listen here

715
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,710
No, no kisses

716
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:47,189
He might have killed somebody. What do you mean might have?

717
01:08:47,750 --> 01:09:00,149
And keep them. Okay, scram and take this character with you. Has this lady been awake?

718
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:03,109
For a third of this movie

719
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:29,029
Look at that

720
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:35,270
All right, come on out of there buddy so that's how I got clunked on the head

721
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,789
Come on. Come on out of there. Yo, I got the slap. I was looking for

722
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:41,270
It's opening. Well, come on. Come on, but

723
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:46,550
Oh, so it's you. Do you know him? Do I know him? He's the guy I caught using the telephone

724
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:51,989
There's no law against that. I don't mind. I'll forget him. I'll just a minute. Do you think you're a little premature premature?

725
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,789
Well, I can't remember that far back. Just who are you? I'm detective coletti

726
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:03,590
An investigator for the securities and exchange commission what i'm on the trail of the gorilla just as you are a detective

727
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:07,430
How do we know that? Yeah securities fraud. Well

728
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:10,229
What were you doing in there investigating?

729
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:15,430
I've been on this case for some weeks now and i've discovered a little about the construction of this house

730
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:18,630
That my good friend here don't seem to have found out yet

731
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:24,789
Insider trading this house is a maze of secret panels

732
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,350
Now undoubtedly the voice of the gorilla came through that radio from someplace right in this house

733
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:33,590
That means that if we find the wire leading away from the radio, we'd at least find the gorilla's hideout

734
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:47,460
It's gonna be the guy that owns the house securities fraud insider trading his big plan

735
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:51,960
Just as I thought

736
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,079
Here's the wire now by tracing this I think we may find the answer to this entire riddle

737
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,880
The wire goes in here

738
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,760
Back of this wall is the man we want becomes the third gorilla. It'd be funny. Are you all armed? Yes

739
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Quiet you here it is

740
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
What

741
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,479
It is your microphone and as I expected there is your gorilla mr steven's the gorilla

742
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,319
Well, sure I could have told you that all the time. I guess the party is over my gorilla

743
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,880
Why is he tied up? Who tied him up like that? I don't know

744
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:29,479
He figured the game was up and that this would throw off suspicion. This is a homemade job a child could have done it

745
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,159
Ah, it's preposterous. Don't believe him. I never saw this man before in my life. It's insane

746
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,859
Now what's that?

747
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:41,560
Uh-oh third gorilla theory incoming

748
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:51,520
alias the gorilla

749
01:11:56,470 --> 01:12:04,760
You can make that two thousand go walter the gorilla. I don't believe it. I think I can make it very clear

750
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:10,920
Oh, sure. We can now first of all, what's that? Uh-oh. I didn't hear a thing. Neither did I but what was it?

751
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,840
Hey, what is this who hit me what's going on around here? It's that man again. Oh, there you are

752
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:27,439
Kidnapped kidnapped by the gorilla not kidnapped by the gorilla. Mr. Conway ap conway. The ap stands for ape

753
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,800
Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the gorilla the gorilla, but if uncle walter's the gorilla

754
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,760
Well, haven't the gorilla been killing people those notes of warning? Oh, the gorilla's been killing people

755
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,399
The beginning of the movie and to throw off suspicion from himself. Mr. Envy

756
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:47,460
Under the terms of your father's will if anything were to happen to you this dude's a terrorist

757
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:54,539
Uncle walter my hunch was right. Your uncle brought you here tonight to kill you for your money

758
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:58,539
Well, at least he had a reason so that's why he wouldn't let us call the police

759
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:04,060
That's exactly why but what about these men these private detectives? They almost speak for themselves

760
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:11,420
Do you think if steven's life had actually been threatened he would have called in three morons such as these holy shit

761
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,220
That's what i'm saying

762
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:19,560
Why resent that but I tell you I saw the gorilla right there in that closet

763
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,520
I saw his hand in his arm and it was no optical confusion. What you saw was this sleeve

764
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,520
Another ingenious little invention of mr. Stevens. It's a very cute little idea

765
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:32,279
Well

766
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:34,279
That about clears the whole matter up

767
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:41,800
And since it stopped raining, I think I better go you're okay buddy. He's all right. Congratulations. Let me congratulate you

768
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Thanks for calling us moron

769
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:46,439
Wait a minute

770
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,359
I know you don't buddy

771
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:55,079
Okay, folks say howdy to the gorilla. What all right give out or this moron is gonna blow your brains out

772
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Well, you see it was only that

773
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
He just has a really hairy hand

774
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,159
But the cops haven't been able to get me. So don't you halfwits get any crazy notions?

775
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,600
And that's what is for steven's he's just as crooked as I told you he was

776
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,159
The trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud

777
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,319
I got tipped off on what was going to happen here tonight how he was going to pretend to be me

778
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:20,359
I was going to get the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and at the same time let him get the blame for all the gorilla murders

779
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:27,420
Are you better careful? You could have just said I haven't been manscaping lately then you'd be fine nervous tonight

780
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:31,479
I advise you not to move

781
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:39,420
Please say some quickly. What is this? I thought the phone was out of order. Maybe he paid his bill. Hello

782
01:14:39,899 --> 01:14:41,739
This is walter steven speaking

783
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:43,500
Send a squad car to my house

784
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,539
We've got the gorilla things are so mixed up around here that even the gorilla doesn't know who the gorilla is

785
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:53,720
He's the gorilla. He's the gorilla. Look what's going on here. They're all gorilla

786
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:59,319
Don't look so sad darling. Your uncle isn't a crook comes the real reveal safe and sound now

787
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,680
You know, you never can tell this is liable to wind up to be a mystery

788
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,720
You see the gorilla murders were threatened to bank up our insurance company

789
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:11,720
Most of the victims were clans of ours. So conway our special investigator cooked up his little scheme to trap the killer

790
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:17,239
I'm sorry. I had to frighten you dear and you too kitty. Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb

791
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,319
You fellas are certainly great detectives. Oh, yeah, we could have told you that

792
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,479
Did you know that claddy was the gorilla all along? Sure we did. No, we didn't

793
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,159
When did you find out he was the gorilla when I shook hands with him? I don't get you

794
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:34,439
Well, you see I was a winter trimmer in a department store and I ought to know a phony feel when I feel one

795
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,359
We'll never be able to thank you. Mr. Harrigan. Oh, well, that's all right

796
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,119
I understand you two are getting married soon. Well, if you call tomorrow soon, well, remember if you have any trouble with her

797
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,520
Our specialty is following wives

798
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,399
You know where to send a check and be sure it's certified from a confederate bank

799
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:07,109
Oh one more thing bye. Oh, that's good. I love them. I love the bye the end

800
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:18,819
The time meets the space monster well, that's gonna have to be that's gonna have to be for a different time

801
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:30,979
That was that was very that was I loved it. I loved it. We're gonna take a little intermission break

802
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:33,590
I'm gonna get another drink

803
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:40,390
And we're gonna come back with uh this plan from outer space nine. Whatever the hell it is. I'll be right back

804
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:44,390
Get some i'll get a popcorn refill if you want to

807
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And grab myself some stuff

808
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,640
Is that what you guys are doing?

809
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:35,029
Wrong lyrics what a fifty dollars from phylactery lich 5000 bits. Thanks for the 50 bucks

810
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:40,310
I said the movie was unironically funny to me. What a gem reminds me of the old three stooges

811
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,869
I can't believe the last line of the movie was bye

812
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:51,479
Uh, we're gonna have to take that as a uh, I think as a tip

813
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,500
We're gonna have to watch more uh fucking ritz brothers movies

814
01:21:55,819 --> 01:22:00,859
That's the first taste of the I think a lot of the ritz brothers movies are in public domain

815
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:10,199
I can't wait to see them as the tag team in the next room of rumble three-way tag interesting. All right coming up next we have

816
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:13,960
Uh, this is this is a lot of you've probably already heard of this before

817
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:23,140
This is plan nine from outer space. This is an old shitty movie. Uh, it's gonna be the middle movie of the night

818
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:29,930
How many characters confirm for the rumble? That's a great question

819
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:34,789
Uh, I think that was a perfect movie

820
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:41,420
It was an hour

821
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Ritz movie thon only ritz movies. Well, here comes plan nine from outer space

822
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,619
Of all the weird movies

823
01:22:50,619 --> 01:22:57,539
I've only seen probably 20 minutes of this movie. I I know it's a total fucking joke

824
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,020
The whole thing sucks. I know

825
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:10,680
We're just gonna watch it. This movie is in video games. Yeah

826
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,199
This movie has nudity

827
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:28,779
Where what this says this had moved is this nudity in this movie? No, this is not what all right

828
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:32,779
I'm gonna hate this movie. This is not a ritz brothers movie. So I mean i'm not gonna like it

829
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:40,569

On that fateful day. Why does this feel like a bad trump impression based only on the secret testimony?

grave robbers from outer space

848
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,520
Jesus christ

Copyright it don't matter anymore. It's shit is free director of photography william c. Thompson

852
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:38,220
All characters and events depicted in this profile is fictitious any similarity to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental

853
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,420
Why do they do a self-park opening for that?

854
01:26:42,460 --> 01:27:05,979
Of course edwood. Yeah. Yeah worst fucking director ever that there is a time to live and that there is a time to die

855
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:10,380
There's a time yet that is always a shock and a time to die behind

856
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:15,750
And your time is good. It is even more of a shock when death the proud brother

857
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,310
Comes suddenly without warning

858
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,819
Just at sundown a small group

859
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:29,539
Gathered in silent prayer around the newly opened grave of the beloved wife of an elderly man

860
01:27:30,949 --> 01:27:36,069
Sundown of the day he's reading this whole thing in his head. They're waiting for him to start of the old man's heart

861
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:51,380
Oh, sorry shadows of grief god. I was doing that in my head clouded his very reason. Come on junior start already fuck

I should have done a funeral over the saddened group left the graveside who died

863
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,630
This is a fucked up gravesite, by the way

864
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:19,579
It did they don't even

865
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:28,329
It was when the gravediggers I feel like they're about to break into song things began to take this is a musical

866
01:28:28,409 --> 01:28:30,409

Surprised me any if he's asleep this time of the morning bank tower

So the shower curtain behind them

874
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,859
It would be fucking hilarious if they pulled that back and a guy was taking a shower right there. Oh damn it. Take a look for yourself

875
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,800
That's nothing from this world

876
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:44,409
What are those steering wheels mayday mayday stand by burbank tower you suppose the passenger side

877

01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:56,729
We'll get a ready for landing and keep it quiet until we get instructions right. Okay, danny american flight 812 reporting to burbank tower over

879
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:11,640
That's the plane

880
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:27,270
Jesus christ, did you hear anything? I thought it did don't like hearing noises, especially when he's supposed to be any

881
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:34,890
Yeah, sort of spooky like maybe we're getting old whatever it is gone now. That's the best thing for us

882
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:40,739
Like i'm watching a bad lip reading video. Am I sure that's not what this is that I clicked the right thing

883
01:30:41,060 --> 01:31:17,880
Oh look at those hands his wife's death became greater and greater agony

884
01:31:18,359 --> 01:31:27,399
The home they had so long shared together

885
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:33,579
Became a tomb this is sad a sweet memory of her joyous living

886
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:37,560
The sky to which she had once looked

887
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:41,319
Was now only a covering for her dead body

888
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:52,520
jesus

889
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,520
This narrator is fucked

890
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:59,260
Beautiful flowers she had planted

891
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,340
with her own hands

892
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:06,420
Became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks

893
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:16,520
Confused by his great loss the old man left that home

894
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,520
Never to return again. What wait?

895
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:27,500
Did he sell it?

896
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:30,140
Did he move his furniture out

897
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:35,079
at the funeral of the old man

898
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:39,479
Unknown to his mourners. He's dead his dead wife

899
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:44,579
Was watching first his wife then he tragic

900
01:32:45,619 --> 01:32:48,979
Why is that door only like five feet tall? Why was his wife buried in the ground?

901
01:32:51,319 --> 01:32:58,329
Something to do with family tradition a superstition of some sort. Oh, well, it's getting dark. Let's be in our way

902
01:33:03,609 --> 01:33:07,289
Then as two of his mourners left his final resting place

903
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,590
Two dummies

904
01:33:14,149 --> 01:33:16,149
Wait, why couldn't they just lie on the ground?

905
01:33:16,949 --> 01:33:18,949
What's the I don't understand

906
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:22,310
The actors couldn't lie on the ground for a second. Why?

907
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,140
Somebody had to make that shit

908
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:39,939
It took probably three or four days to make them. They were too old to lie on the ground

909
01:33:39,939 --> 01:33:43,750
No, one of them was like 40. I don't buy that for a second later

910
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:52,149
The police led by inspector daniel clay arrived at the scene who found them the man and girl medical

911
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:59,479
Exterminer, where's the gorilla just left the morgue wagon ought to be along most any time you get their statement

912
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:06,979
Yeah, as much as we could they're pretty scared finding a mess like this ought to make anyone frightened

913
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:13,850
Have one of the boys take the guy and the girl back to town. You take it. Okay inspector

914
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:15,930
What are you going to do knock it around?

915
01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:19,689
Pretty dark out there. What once you get beyond the range of those lights

916
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:23,850
You won't be able to see your hand in front of your face. This is an snl skit. That's dan ackroy in the middle

917
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:46,920
Be careful, but i'm a big boy now johnny. He'll smoke

918
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:53,220
You guys think that's fog. No, no, no, this is what the 30s looked like

919
01:34:54,300 --> 01:35:08,329
Every motherfucker smoked

920
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:14,949
50s. Yeah, whatever

921
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:17,750
This was every bar and restaurant in fucking 1955

922
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:41,750
Say lieutenant to get that funny odor. How could I miss it? Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now

923
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:47,449
I thought they were dummies. I thought they were fucking mannequins. I was about to say why

924
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:51,529
A lot of police cars and lights I stopped but I didn't see anything

925
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,479
Oh, well, whatever it is. It's a mosquito

926
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:06,699
The fence you seem to still be up there somewhere. Yeah, that's pretty fucked up

927
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:11,340
Maybe I am why is this so bent? I don't think i've ever seen you in this mood before

928
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:23,699
They're at a cardboard. This is because i've never been in this mood before something about your flight

929
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:30,340
Even his clothes look fake like his shirt looks like it's made out of fucking cardboard

930
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,659
I saw a flying saucer

931
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:43,109
Saucer you mean the kind from up there?

932
01:36:43,829 --> 01:36:46,500
Yeah, it's kind of part

933
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,779
It was shaped like a huge cigar dan either saw it too

934
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:54,579
When it passed over the whole compartment lighted up with a blinding glare you mean the sky

935
01:36:54,579 --> 01:36:59,220
Yeah, tremendous wind it practically knocked us off our course. Did you report it? Yeah

936
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,819
Radioed in immediately and they said we'll keep it quiet until you land

937
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:08,659
As soon as we landed big army brass grabbed us and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing

938
01:37:10,119 --> 01:37:13,560
Burns me up. These things have been seen for years. They're here. It's a fact

939
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:17,960
And the public ought to know about it. There must be something more you can do about it

940
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:21,000
Only there isn't all but what's the use of making a fuss?

941
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:27,100
But last night I saw a flying object. They couldn't have possibly been from this planet

942
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:33,050
Honey, you should make a bunch of facebook posts about it muzzle by army brass. I can't even admit I saw the thing

943
01:37:35,029 --> 01:37:51,590
Fuck

944
01:37:51,590 --> 01:38:18,920
Rumor she's here. Is anybody gonna say anything say something?

945
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:52,659
We talk. Okay. I can't just be me. Oh, you know, he's a villain money. Oh, it's his arm. I'm about to get his nose

946
01:38:53,939 --> 01:39:07,300
With a big cape. It's the butler again. Oh god

947
01:39:07,939 --> 01:39:18,630
What where is where all the what where's the officers? Where is everybody?

948
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:36,920
Shoot him shoot him with your gun sounds like pay in trouble

949
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:40,439
Oh

950
01:39:53,899 --> 01:39:56,300
Paula and russell, oh no, he's dead

951
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,810
Somebody said na aim

952
01:40:03,369 --> 01:40:15,470
God. Ah, it looks like he wanted me invited to tsm. Is he dead? Yeah

953
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:19,770
He's messed up as bad as those two back there

954
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:27,159
Suppose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this their guess is good as mine, larry

955
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:31,289
Don't itch your neck with a gun. Oh my god, what are you doing?

956
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,430
He's gonna kill himself

957
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,470
You're in charge now lieutenant, yeah

958
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:44,750
This is like freaking me the fuck out his finger on the trigger. He's itching his neck with the barrel of the gun

959
01:40:45,069 --> 01:40:48,909
Tell the coroner he's got to make another trip out here. Well, how about the lab boys?

960
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:59,789
Who do you think we left back up the car boy scouts? Come on. Oh, no another funeral

961
01:41:00,029 --> 01:41:04,029
It's just this fucking same day than to lay down his life

962
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:11,210
For another it is always difficult to have last words over the grave of a friend

963
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:17,119
An inspector daniel clay was a friend a dear friend to me

964
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:23,520
And to all of us by the way, who's the scary lady in makeup and in costume?

965
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:29,050
Now we lay him to rest a rest well deserved

966
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:32,510
So premature

967
01:41:35,659 --> 01:41:41,659
At the funeral there's more than one flying saucer

968
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:49,159
People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw three flying saucers

969
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,119
saucers seen over hollywood

970
01:42:03,529 --> 01:42:06,159
Whoa

971
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:15,050
It's not a rainbow in the sky telephones. Oh look, there's a rainbow forming over there kind of cool. I guess

972
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:35,979
Why was that so hard like his shit face there comes a time in each man's life

973
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,859
But he can't even believe his own eyes

974
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:51,039
Okay, saucers seen over hollywood flying saucers seen over washington dc

975
01:42:52,640 --> 01:43:00,520
At the military convoy moved into the field

976
01:43:06,189 --> 01:43:10,380
missile launchers

977
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:19,789
Already quickly set up colonel tom edwards in charge of saucer field activities

978
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,909
Was to make the greatest decision of his career

979
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:25,550
He made that decision

980
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:28,430
Colonel edwards gave the signal to fire

981
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:30,430
There

982
01:43:30,909 --> 01:43:39,239
All of them missed

983
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,560
Not one rocket hit its location target

984
01:43:51,289 --> 01:43:53,289
In the chat you can see

985
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,729
Nice air shot noob

986
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,609
Molding he must be pretending

987
01:44:14,329 --> 01:44:17,770
Is the entire united states military pretending?

988
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,340
These were the things that the local citizens were saying

989
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:40,539
They were gone even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters

990
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:44,619
They weren't even moving they were standing still even I could do that

991
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:53,279
Quite a sight wasn't it sir a sight i'd rather not be seeing are you worried about them, sir?

992
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,680
No, i'm worried about your comedy radio

993
01:44:56,250 --> 01:45:05,069
Visits that would indicate visitors the big guns a usual way of welcoming visitors. We haven't always fired at them

994
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:12,590
Oh for a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response then they attacked a town

995
01:45:13,369 --> 01:45:18,909
When where a small town i'll admit but nevertheless a town of people it's a made-up government conspiracy

996
01:45:21,529 --> 01:45:23,529
All right, I need to rewind

997
01:45:23,529 --> 01:45:30,250
I i'm rewinding what the fuck did he say a sight i'd rather not be seeing are you worried about them, sir?

998
01:45:30,649 --> 01:45:37,119
Well, they must have a reason for their visits visits. That would indicate visitors. They killed people they died

999
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,060
I made this up right now to justify firing 10 000

1000
01:45:41,539 --> 01:45:44,340
Mistrels at them that were 500 million dollars for a time

1001
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:51,550
We tried to contact them by radio, but no response then they attacked a town a small town

1002
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:58,100
I'll admit but nevertheless a town of people people who died. I never heard about that, sir

1003
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:03,460
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon take any fire

1004
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:09,979
And that's all I need to say to get another 500 billion dollars in revenue then wonder flying

1005
01:46:09,979 --> 01:46:19,199
Actual life are still a rumor officially. I'd like to beat them off again, sir

1006
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,300
What do they want? Where are they from? Where are they going? They sir?

1007
01:46:25,859 --> 01:46:32,560
Who? Well, this is a training maneuver, sir. We only did a little practice firing at the clouds. What?

1008
01:46:33,869 --> 01:46:40,260
Yeah, I wonder what their next move will be so they would deliberately not hitting them

1009
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,359
Are you sure you can't use some of the tax dollars to rebuild a few schools?

1010
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:52,670
Really guys, what will their next move be?

1011
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:03,760
Your space commander has returned from earth send him in wait. They're just people

1012
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:15,079
It's a it's a race of bob. Hope we had to pull in here to space station seven for regeneration

1013
01:47:15,539 --> 01:47:24,609
We're returning to the planet earth immediately thereafter. What progress has been made we contacted government officials. They refuse our existence

1014
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:29,520
What plan will you follow now plan nine?

1015
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:38,159
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures. Their soul is too controlled plan nine

1016
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:42,899
Ah, yes plan nine deals with the resurrection of the dead

1017
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:50,380
Long distance electrode shortens opinion pituitary grounds of recent dead. Have you attempted any of this plan as yet?

1018
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:56,050
Yes, excellency how successful I want one of these costumes. We have risen too so far

1019
01:47:56,449 --> 01:48:03,340
We shall be just as successful on more the living they have no suspicion of your movements

1020
01:48:03,739 --> 01:48:05,739
We had to dispose of one policeman

1021
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:10,960
However, none of those risen have been seen at least not by anyone who still remains alive

1022
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:18,140
It's too bad. It must be handled this way, but it must those who we take from the grave

1023
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:24,800
We can't wait for that curtain to open it is mario free continue on report to me in two earth days

1024
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:32,350
I feared his excellency wouldn't take our report this well

1025
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,869
Well had he been dealing with her own people his reaction would have been completely different

1026
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:38,479
He understands the difficulties of the earth race

1027
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:42,479
What do you think will be the next obstacle the earth people will put in our way?

1028
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,760
He looks what's he gonna draw?

1029
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,880
Just gonna draw on them as long as they can think we'll have our problems

1030
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:53,819
But those whom we're using cannot think they are the dead brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns

1031
01:48:54,539 --> 01:48:55,340
No

1032
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:56,300
You know

1033
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:03,460
It's an interesting thing when you consider the earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot the dead

1034
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,760
They didn't even think they like put them in makeup or something. Our ship should be regenerated. We better get started

1035
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,500
They just have different clothes on oh they aliens. They're just like we're just people with clothes on

1036
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:22,029
These earthlings which we all of us are in this room the producers didn't think to even dye our hair green

1037
01:49:22,430 --> 01:50:02,659
Where's the tie fighter sound? Hello, honey. I'm back from the set wall where there's nothing behind us

1038
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:16,800
I still think you're going nothing's going to take me from it besides most men try and keep their wives from going home

1039
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,399
It's not the point. That's all the point. There's going to be

1040
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:23,819
Why is he leaving for work at night?

1041
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:26,140
I don't people work nights, man

1042
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,149
What are you talking about?

1043
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:37,310
It's a weird kiss that was like a he fucked that up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got hold on

1044
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:45,199
Will you tell him to pick another house to watch this kiss that was he fucking missed that so much

1045
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:50,880
Don't worry about me. He like opened his bottom lip and she right now she's thinking fuck. That was so wet and gross

1046
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:59,069
They're up there, but there's something in that cemetery. I can't wait to fucking wipe my arm on my mouth when he says cut

1047
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:06,539
The saucers are up there and the cemeteries out there, but i'll be locked up in there

1048
01:51:08,609 --> 01:51:10,609
Now what the fuck are they doing?

1049
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:14,529
What are you doing? You promise you like the first time they've ever kissed a human

1050
01:51:15,489 --> 01:51:20,289
He said these are the aliens. These are the aliens down here with your pillow. I figured it out. I know the whole movie

1051
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,659
I have to have something to keep me company while you're away

1052
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,199
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely

1053
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,529
I reach over and touch it

1054
01:51:32,689 --> 01:51:36,210
Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore. Wait, do you reach over and touch his what?

1055
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,060
crazy kid

1056
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:48,560
What who are you touching? What's going on? I do love you darling

1057
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,359
These humans don't

1058
01:51:57,359 --> 01:51:59,359
These are not humans

1059
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:05,199
That hurt that hurt both of them. They both are in pain right now physical pain. See you thursday. Goodbye, honey

1060
01:52:06,369 --> 01:52:10,130
You could see three distinct rolls on the side of his face that hurt them

1061
01:52:10,989 --> 01:52:13,310
You know, i'm not leaving here until you lock. What's the pressure?

1062
01:52:26,859 --> 01:52:34,689
If you're especially nice, I'm hey, make sure you smoke in the house. You keep the yard lights on smoke everywhere

1063
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:43,260
Don't worry the yellow stains on the fucking ceiling and the walls 30 years from now won't drop the property value of our home

1064
01:52:43,979 --> 01:53:02,909
Why wouldn't I guess i'm preoccupied Danny?

1065
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:10,590
We've got 33 passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied flying this flyer bird doesn't give you that opportunity

1066
01:53:10,829 --> 01:53:14,750
Is that a clock in the top left or a plate? I don't know. That's a weird clock

1067
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:20,420
It's a clock. There's nothing wrong between you two. Oh, no, nothing like that

1068
01:53:20,899 --> 01:53:24,819
Just that i'm worried she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

1069
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:29,060
Those incidents in the graveyard these past few days just just got me worried

1070
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:32,420
Well, maybe they haven't figured out those crazy skybird yet

1071
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:36,739
But I give you a 50 to one odds the police have cleared out that cemetery thing by now. I hope so

1072
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:42,500
If you're really that worried Jeff, why don't you go radio in and find out really wish you would let me on your fucking animal crossing

1073
01:53:42,579 --> 01:53:44,579
Island, uh some my turnips jake

1074
01:53:45,579 --> 01:53:47,899
Hi, kind of fucking annoying that you haven't invited me yet

1075
01:53:47,979 --> 01:53:52,619
From this end of the plane since we left the field i've just been giving himself and me a study in silence

1076
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:55,659
Your boys aren't feuding. I don't want to bring it up. I will

1077
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,939
Hey, how about you and me balling it up in albuquerque?

1078
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:04,380
Have you read that flight schedule boy? What about it? Well, that was relevant albuquerque at 4 a.m

1079
01:54:04,779 --> 01:54:09,579
That's strictly a nine o'clock town. Well, I know a friend that'll help us. Let's have a problem first

1080
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:14,060
Ah, he's worried about paula. I read about that shit. All right

1081
01:54:14,699 --> 01:54:17,659
Let's take the loss two kids not to buy too near one of those things

1082
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,380
We get there soon enough as it is

1083
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:25,500
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there. No doubt about that. It's quite all right like a tomb

1084
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,670
I'm, sorry jeff. That was a bad joke

1085
01:54:29,069 --> 01:54:34,670
Say I almost forgot when I came in me too. I know what it's like coffee situation. That's for me. It sure would hurt

1086
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:38,989
Okay, be right back and say jeff make that call to me

1087
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:45,550
Nah, not only she throw cold water on my albuquerque clan, but now she's repeating herself and someone put their fucking hands on the wheel

1088
01:54:46,029 --> 01:54:48,029
I can't resist your child anybody

1089
01:54:48,989 --> 01:55:01,460
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder the flash of lightning

1090
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:07,939
But from the blast arose the moving figure of the dead old man

1091
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:13,550
This looks like a deep fake

1092
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,949
It's like a richard nixon deep fake

1093
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:29,920
How embarrassing if we put richard nixon's face on here the hospital bed is that a bed

1094
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:35,409
Why is a fire alarm your ringtone?

1095
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:57,470
Okay, mac

1096
01:55:57,470 --> 01:55:58,909
Look at that picture up there

1097
01:55:58,909 --> 01:56:00,609
That's not

1098
01:56:00,609 --> 01:56:07,439
Look, that's not even the two people that live in this house. These are two random fucking people

1099
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,600
We're led to believe that's her and him. Nope. That's two random people

1100
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:25,659
I don't know who the fuck they are

1101
01:56:25,659 --> 01:56:44,239
there's

1102
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:46,399
Wait, what? Huh? Am I going fucking crazy?

1103
01:56:46,560 --> 01:57:03,390
Hi, mac. Am I going insane? Sure. I'm all right. That's not even the that's a superimposed photo

1104
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:08,479
Is it that's not even the picture that's there?

1105
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:18,000
What the fuck?

1106
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:28,500
deep fake

1107
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,340
Okay, I I could take this guy I could take that i'll pick up a lamp and hit him in the fucking head

1108
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:36,180
You know what I mean? Like if you're just like putting your hand on your mouth and like going like this

1109
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,819
No, no, no, give me the phone. I'll fucking bash you in the head with that phone

1110
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:44,130
And apparently they live right next to a graveyard

1111
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,520
They live on the graveyard

1112
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,399
Holy shit, we're talking property value cigarette smoke graveyard. This house was 40 dollars

1113
01:57:52,800 --> 01:58:12,579
They got this house at auction. Why was it? Yeah, what?

1114
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,220
Wasn't it just nighttime?

1115
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:19,479
daytime

1116
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:22,279
All right. This lady is doing the I have a dump in my pants walk

1117
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,840
Like this is the walk you do when you shit your pants

1118
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:34,239
You freeze and you fucking just slowly just move your hands up and down and move shimmy

1119
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:41,680
Did it go through the underwear into my pants? I hope it's just the underwear because I can take those off

1120
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:46,479
I can take the underwear off and put the pants back on but fuck. Hopefully it didn't go through

1121
01:58:47,520 --> 01:59:00,310
This dark vader

1122
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:02,310
There's a vader up there

1123
01:59:21,189 --> 01:59:22,630
The egg

1124
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:53,199
Kind of does look like the egg, huh?

1125
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:55,199
Why are you running through the graveyard?

1126
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,720
Get to her road

1127
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,800
Finally, thank you

1128
02:00:04,289 --> 02:00:22,020
Um when he knows who this is

1129
02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:37,810
He's talking about the egg

1130
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:43,729
That's the egg right there. That's like the tucked in fan of the pants pulled up like steve urkel with tucked in

1131
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:46,369
That's the egg

1132
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:57,840
Okay, run him over

1133
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,840
Just drive over that guy's head

1134
02:01:01,989 --> 02:01:03,590
Run over his head

1135
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,829
I bet you probably get cursed forever or something, right?

1136
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:08,229
Yeah, it's not a good idea

1137
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,560
Why am I getting like the holy shit psycho face? This is dracula run his fucking head over

1138
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:18,369
What and that makes me a psycho?

1139
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:22,920
Run over that guy's head. He's a he's a dracula psycho killer guy

1140
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:31,859
What i'm trying to get rid of him. No, i'll go ask him for directions guys. That's a good idea

1141
02:01:42,479 --> 02:02:01,239
We're gonna get another funeral

1142
02:02:01,239 --> 02:02:03,239
That's a home video camera

1143
02:02:03,239 --> 02:02:04,600
pointing at him

1144
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,920
He's testing out his cosplay for the next convention

1145
02:02:08,869 --> 02:02:10,869
That was not meant to be released to the public at all

1146
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:37,670
His iCloud got hacked. It's like that's unfortunate. He'll be at the hatch in a moment. You can open it now, tana

1147
02:02:37,989 --> 02:02:43,750
So we're back in the ufo

1148
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,880
Where does that letter go

1149
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,680
You're late for dinner you three

1150
02:02:59,159 --> 02:03:09,859
They can't tell us from anyone else. Oh brussels sprouts again mom

1151
02:03:12,149 --> 02:03:30,850
Sit down and eat. It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for

1152
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:35,409
I don't think the lieutenant does either then what are we doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago

1153
02:03:35,569 --> 02:03:39,010
Oh, don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hard hand just like you

1154
02:03:46,869 --> 02:03:53,029
Cole phelps what do you suppose that noise was whatever it was. It's no more strange any other things happening around this cemetery

1155
02:03:54,149 --> 02:04:00,720
Spirits like old farmer caller talked about what maybe the only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath

1156
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,239
Oh, don't forget. Mr. Trent claims to have seen them too. She didn't have anything on her breath. God damn it was hysterical

1157
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:13,300
True she was frightened and then to stay the shock, but don't forget that thorn knight gone in the scratch feet

1158
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:16,399
Yeah, I

1159
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:22,439
Hadn't thought of that guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and i'm still a uniformed cop

1160
02:04:23,329 --> 02:04:27,489
Sometimes it's only the brakes larry. See we don't give a shit like how far can you fit this gun down your mouth?

1161
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:31,569
Let me check let me do it too. It was strange. We don't give a fuck no more than you do

1162
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:38,789
Went for orders I get out of here makes you say that you remember the noise we heard the other night

1163
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:46,550
We were not to the ground how could I forget exactly but you're not remembering that sound there you're wrong lieutenant

1164
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:50,949
I'm with the fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

1165
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:56,869
Well, haven't you heard and many times the saucer hasn't had a goal or a light of any kind for that matter

1166
02:04:58,069 --> 02:05:02,869
That proves it what next lieutenant. Oh lieutenant. I wanted to take that hat off

1167
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:07,109
And fucking wicked long beautiful hair just blows down

1168
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:12,869
Uh, why come on man out with it. We haven't got all data waste. Oh, uh, just uh over there beyond the crib

1169
02:05:13,029 --> 02:05:16,659
All right, show us away

1170
02:05:16,659 --> 02:05:26,600
Look here. Here it is lieutenant. Yeah, it's been broken into all right strange

1171
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:29,960
If someone had broken in the dirt should be piled up here

1172
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:32,439
How long do we have the lease on this warehouse for the graveyard?

1173
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,560
Might as well use the fuck out of it for every single scene in the movie

1174
02:05:41,319 --> 02:05:48,319
This spot look we shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of the next akin. Let's go get it

1175
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:55,479
How I see what you mean the gravestones down there well, let's go down and find out whose grave it is really

1176
02:05:55,479 --> 02:06:01,029
I'm doing that stance quit doing that stand. You're copying me now. Are you sure you mean that lieutenant?

1177
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:07,649
If I didn't mean it, I wouldn't have said it scared. Well, why do I get hooked up with these spooked details?

1178
02:06:08,189 --> 02:06:10,189
monsters graves bodies

1179
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:24,149
All right, it's the ritz brothers with an added brother caskets here, but nobody's in it

1180
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:29,890
Can you read the name on the casket? It's too dark

1181
02:06:30,689 --> 02:06:37,399
Give me a flashlight. How about a match? We sure could buy a cigarette. Let me have them. Okay

1182
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:49,010
Here have a cigarette. These were like eating apples in the 40s. Inspector clay's grave, but he ain't in it

1183
02:06:49,329 --> 02:07:01,170
But meanwhile at the pentagon in washington dc these guys are still flying this plane

1184
02:07:01,729 --> 02:07:06,180
Are they ever gonna land?

1185
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:19,279
Right g2 come in. Yes, of course keep in touch. Come in colonel avers

1186
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:24,210
Yes

1187
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:31,010
One star general why is that so why is that I don't know why that's funny what he

1188
02:07:31,890 --> 02:07:36,789
Understand colonel. You've been tapped for many of our saucer attacks. Why is that funny?

1189
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:43,729
I don't charge a field operation, sir. Well the mic there are such things as flying sauces colonel

1190
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:55,920
Where's the mic there's a mic in the frame in washington dc

1191
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:04,399
I didn't even see it right g2 where

1192
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,920
Come in yes, of course keep in touch

1193
02:08:13,779 --> 02:08:23,800
Come in colonel avers close the door at ease colonel. Thank you, sir. Sit down

1194
02:08:24,199 --> 02:08:28,680
I'm just waiting for like a guy in glasses with like a notepad to walk in and just be like oops and see the camera

1195
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,680
And walk back like a script supervisor

1196
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I'm in charge of field operation, sir

1197
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:43,779
You believe there are such things as flying sauces colonel, yes, sir uncrowned

1198
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,229
Yes, sir

1199
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:51,510
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer

1200
02:08:52,229 --> 02:09:01,220
Yes, sir. You stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers. Well, uh, yes, sir

1201
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:11,619
This could mean a court martial admitting this against direct orders general roberts. May I speak freely you may

1202
02:09:11,859 --> 02:09:17,460
No, how could I hope to hold down my command if I didn't believe in what I saw and said no

1203
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:20,800
Why are you talking?

1204
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,449
I

1205
02:09:22,449 --> 02:09:32,680
Like you colonel here. Would you like an apple? There are flying saucers. There's no doubt. They are in our skies

1206
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:39,189
I've been there for some time. What are we going to do about them? Who knows then?

1207
02:09:39,829 --> 02:09:47,569
They really are there by the two phones. I thought you were convinced of that. I am we've had contact. Why are there two phones?

1208
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:49,250
contact

1209
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:53,319
Radio they speak our language. Well, one's a cell phone

1210
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:57,000
We received messages from their spaceships for a while

1211
02:09:57,079 --> 02:09:59,640
It came in as just a lot of jumbled noise

1212
02:10:00,119 --> 02:10:05,159
I don't want my wife to know who i'm calling on my second line tried contact with us by radio

1213
02:10:05,319 --> 02:10:11,510
We've developed a language computer a machine that breaks down any language. See I sell drugs too

1214
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:15,109
You've seen that movie that tv show with brian cranson

1215
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:19,539
You've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while

1216
02:10:19,779 --> 02:10:24,739
I think it's about time you heard these recordings you mind mind

1217
02:10:25,699 --> 02:10:36,069
I'm anxious. He's a two-star general. So he has two phones. God damn it

1218
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:55,460
From a planet of your galaxy. I fully realize or as you want the language so you can now understand since the beginning of your time

1219
02:10:55,859 --> 02:10:57,859
We have been far beyond your planet

1220
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:04,340
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago. We're flex, dude

1221
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:11,729
Do you still believe it impossible we exist you didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe

1222
02:11:12,739 --> 02:11:17,189
How can any race be so stupid permit me to set your mind at ease?

1223
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:21,649
How can anybody be so stupid your planet only save it

1224
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:28,960
We could have destroyed it long ago if that had been our aim our principal purpose is friendly

1225
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:34,199
I admit we have had to take certain means which you might refer to as criminal

1226
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:38,880
But that is the cause of your big guns which have destroyed some of our representative

1227
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:47,239
If you persist in denying us our landlands, then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms

1228
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:51,279
We then have no alternative but to destroy you

1229
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:56,640
Before you destroy us with your ancient juvenile minds

1230
02:11:57,199 --> 02:12:01,520
You have developed explosives too fast for your mind to perceive what you were doing

1231
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:07,439
This really is la noir the verge of destroying the entire we are a part of that

1232
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:20,279
This is our last that's the end of that one atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting

1233
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:24,369
How many of these recordings do you have general and even dozen up to now?

1234
02:12:24,529 --> 02:12:28,449
This was the last one we received it over a month ago. Do you think they mean business?

1235
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:33,239
We can't afford to take any chances come over here. Thank you language computer

1236
02:12:35,409 --> 02:12:38,689
You ever been to hollywood? Oh a couple of times a few years ago

1237
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:41,510
You're going to be there in the morning

1238
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:44,630
Just a few minutes from hollywood in the town of san fernando

1239
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:51,439
Reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust knocked people to the ground

1240
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:55,859
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings. What is that on the left?

1241
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:59,640
Is that an x-ray of his abdomen while you're out there by the way?

1242
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:04,520
What do you think about these man for the job of attempting to contact them find them colonel?

1243
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:09,159
See what in hell it is. They want all right, sir. I'd be concerned

1244
02:13:10,119 --> 02:13:18,050
These are confidential reports colonel read them over carefully on the plane

1245
02:13:18,609 --> 02:13:26,470
Turn them over to intelligence when you get to los angeles. They'll have further orders for disposition. Yes, sir. Here's my laptop

1246
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:31,380
Yes, sir. Good luck. Thank you, sir

1247
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,380
Here's my luck god damn it

1248
02:13:48,579 --> 02:13:53,960
Aliens stands up straight and they do weird things. We stand up straight. That's how you know

1249
02:13:53,960 --> 02:14:04,039
We're fucking aliens because we have good posture. We are ready your excellency. You are many days late

1250
02:14:04,359 --> 02:14:11,590
It was unavoidable. We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric conditions made transmission impossible

1251
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:16,000
You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted. I thought time was of the essence

1252
02:14:16,779 --> 02:14:20,880
Suspicion has fallen upon our movements our ships have been viewed near the point of operations

1253
02:14:21,989 --> 02:14:27,590
And what has this added time gained euros? What does even axe we have successfully risen three of the dead ones

1254
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:31,750
Why is that his family crest they have axes in space bring in the big one

1255
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:44,020
Use your small electrode gun. I have taken two ships from your command that will leave only my ship

1256
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:51,670
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone. I have need of your other ships elsewhere

1257
02:14:52,449 --> 02:14:58,229
Even though you have risen three of the earth dead the plan is far from successful

1258
02:14:58,689 --> 02:15:07,569
And you euros must prove it an operational success before more time energy ships and your countrymen may be spent on it

1259
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:12,069
No, no aliens have died. Everything is on our side

1260
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:16,640
Not everything you do not have the live earth people

1261
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,560
line

1262
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:26,840
You reported that your ship was viewed at the scene of your present operations. That is correct

1263
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:36,710
They have been viewed many times but not at the scene of operations something must be done about that. I want this guy to talk

1264
02:15:39,029 --> 02:15:45,989
Stop him turner. He's close enough turn off your electrode gun. No

1265
02:15:45,989 --> 02:15:48,479
No

1266
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:03,220
That's a nintendo light gun

1267
02:16:03,939 --> 02:16:06,439
That was too close

1268
02:16:06,439 --> 02:16:11,920
Yes

1269
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:23,800
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him. What is he doing to him?

1270
02:16:24,039 --> 02:16:30,020
He's giving him acupuncture. I don't understand what this is supposed to do. Yes. She's a fine specimen

1271
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:35,040
Are they all this powerful on planet earth? This one is an exception excellency

1272
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:39,379
What are the other two like one is a woman the other an old man

1273
02:16:47,559 --> 02:16:52,639
This gives me a plan put the big one away pick up your electrode gun

1274
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,120
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him

1275
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:01,319
And make sure the two tracking devices can see you in vr god damn it

1276
02:17:01,319 --> 02:17:14,530
How do you not know this by now mary the old one must be sacrificed?

1277
02:17:15,569 --> 02:17:20,500
We land on earth send the old one do what we do

1278
02:17:20,899 --> 02:17:25,700
Tape two to your legs then cut the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray

1279
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:33,200
The result will astound those watching astound them enough to delay their intention until you have

1280
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:42,079
Gained your other recruits from the cemetery. Yes, excellency. It'll be done report to me when this has been accomplished

1281
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:57,989
Hear us the earth people are getting closer to that which we fear since they will not listen or respect our existence

1282
02:17:58,389 --> 02:18:02,389
They cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking around again

1283
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:07,829
Brought about by our advancement and such things as soon as you have enough for the dead recruits

1284
02:18:08,309 --> 02:18:11,590
March them on the capitals of the earth. Let nothing stand in your way

1285
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:17,430
I thought they were blurring his crest out to make them accept our existence like they didn't want to get sued by mcdonald's or something

1286
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:26,850
He's just reading

1287
02:18:53,639 --> 02:18:55,639
Cemetery again

1288
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:59,920
I have four sets in this whole movie

1289
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:04,979
Cemetery backyard. This is colonel edwards from washington dc spaceship god damn

1290
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:14,290
Colonel would like to ask a few questions questions. What about colonel? May I uh sit down? Oh, i'm sorry

1291
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:20,579
Please do I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night when you saw the flying saucer. That's uncomfortable

1292
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:27,379
After that the police brought me home

1293
02:19:27,459 --> 02:19:31,360
I hope I never see such a sight again. Well after your description

1294
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:36,690
I don't think i'd want to see it either one thing more after you were forced to the ground

1295
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:40,850
But that blast of wind was it a hot or cold Coca-Cola coke Coca-Cola

1296
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:49,079
It's kind of hard to explain wasn't hot wasn't cold. It's just a terrific force. We we couldn't get off the ground

1297
02:19:49,969 --> 02:19:51,969
The light blinded me so badly

1298
02:19:51,969 --> 02:19:53,409
I couldn't see a thing

1299
02:19:53,409 --> 02:19:56,959
We could only feel the pressure of the wind until it was gone

1300
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:04,739
When the glare left us we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance which way toward the cemetery

1301
02:20:06,389 --> 02:20:08,819
Oh here they come

1302
02:20:09,059 --> 02:20:17,440
Have we seen this guy's face one time? Oh, yeah. Yeah, right right. Yeah here we have

1303
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:26,239
This is the most fantastic story i've ever heard and every word of it's true, too

1304
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:29,479
That's the fantastic part of it colonel

1305
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:34,049
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery then again

1306
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:37,059
They got mileage out of that one

1307
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,200
Lieutenant turn the car off

1308
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:24,799
Does he get zapped? Please zap him please

1309
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:42,200
Why do they always when the car and close the door roll the windows up he can't get in

1310
02:21:43,239 --> 02:21:45,239
This guy has no fucking powers

1311
02:21:45,959 --> 02:22:10,000
He's just a little odd

1312
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:16,149
Why are you standing still run maybe run the fuck away

1313
02:22:17,430 --> 02:22:36,200
This guy has the same emotion the whole scene

1314
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:43,409
What do you make of that? She caught me didn't look that way a minute ago. What about your man?

1315
02:22:43,649 --> 02:22:56,440
Oh, did you say when I forgot all about kelton? Uh, he'll be all right in a few minutes. How do you know?

1316
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:01,639
Did you see that thing? Did you get it? We got it. What was it?

1317
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:06,280
It didn't fall. I fired every bullet I had so no you got him

1318
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:09,440
You got him

1319
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:25,479
Five-year-old

1320
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:30,200
Back to the cemetery, yeah

1321
02:23:37,190 --> 02:23:39,530
I thought he was gonna go to smoke his cigarette

1322
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:45,959
Like oh let me take a drag it's my turn

1323
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:55,600
Yes, sir stay with mrs. Trent. All right lieutenant. I used to close to the officer, honey

1324
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:00,549
I'd feel safer with you. Oh, yeah, there's there's still two enemies remaining

1325
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:20,979
You have a gun. You know how to use one to four years in the marine corps

1326
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:30,280
What just say yeah, what tell let's get going where's his did he just give him his gun

1327
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:36,209
Yeah, I want you to be responsible for shooting the lady. Not me. I was here but I didn't do it

1328
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:51,159
What you take it you fire would expect to find out here. Yeah, there's only one answer. Trent

1329
02:24:51,399 --> 02:24:56,879
We'll know when we find inspector clay is great right over here. Is that the one yeah guns?

1330
02:24:56,959 --> 02:25:06,120
Don't do anything. Why are they still firing?

1331
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:11,729
Just pick up a fucking tombstone and hit her in the face

1332
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:23,409
This is to me like someone that's broken off instead of in i'm surviving during the zombie apocalypse guys

1333
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:31,360
Some things just can't happen. Yeah. Well after that apparition that was draped across mr

1334
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:37,559
Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything. Look colonel. I'm a policeman

1335
02:25:37,719 --> 02:25:43,459
I've got the deal in facts. I guess i'll have to go along with you

1336
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:48,290
You know, i'll pet my badge right now. We haven't seen the last of those weirdies

1337
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:58,040
They'll discover our ship soon. You're going to let them find us. It's the only way

1338
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:01,000
These are the same men who have been so close so often

1339
02:26:01,399 --> 02:26:05,280
They must be halted before they can inform others about us, but there were others in the car

1340
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:12,440
This is a painted garage. That's a garage the big one for the girl and the policeman

1341
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:22,040
I'll turn on the digital robotaries and burst them. Yep. That's the door going into your house from your garage

1342
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:30,420
Look at the floor. The whole movie is a garage

1343
02:26:30,899 --> 02:26:42,629
Oh shit, you're right. No, it's a real spaceship

1344
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:56,309
One thing a policeman learns. Mr. Trent is patience. Where's that burn spot you mentioned right over there. I'm gonna piss my pants

1345
02:26:56,790 --> 02:27:16,239
Oh, we got a long way to go. We'll investigate but move carefully. All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna pee

1346
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:24,260
I'm gonna i'm gonna piss my pants. I'll be right back interlude. We got 20 minutes left of the movie interlude

1347
02:27:24,579 --> 02:33:11,280
Go to the lobby. Well, get back in here. Hurry up. Get in here the projectionist the project the

1348
02:33:13,090 --> 02:33:24,850
Projectionist it's a hard word to say back to the movie. I scared you. I'm sorry. That's a heart. No, no

1349
02:33:24,850 --> 02:33:28,770
No, that's that has nothing to do with the amount of drinks. I've had that's a hard word to say

1350
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:55,030
Projectionist projectionist. It's difficult. No, I've had two drinks. Relax. Here we go. I got behind you turn around

1351
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:57,670
Why she's sleeping in the car?

1352
02:34:00,950 --> 02:34:20,790
The equivalent of wiping his cheeto hands on his sleeves that doesn't do very much damage

1353
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:29,120
And you will be the first live earth people the car was

1354
02:34:30,239 --> 02:34:32,239
a celestial ship

1355
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:35,680
That's a fucking hand dryer from the bathroom

1356
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:46,200
What do you see only my reflection must be some kind of one-way glass

1357
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:50,709
I wonder how you get into this thing. I'm not sure I want to find out

1358
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:58,420
Humans have made it on board the garage

1359
02:35:01,379 --> 02:35:06,659
They've stepped over the water heater and avoided the cardboard boxes from the move we did three years ago

1360
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:26,280
You can open the outer they've just crossed the power washer. We've never used though. We bought truly truly saying we were going to use it

1361
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:36,950
These things speed around we might just get in then off it goes. That's a chance we take

1362
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:43,090
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes might just as well see what the inside one of these looks like

1363
02:35:43,569 --> 02:35:47,170
Got your guns ready. I'll tell you one thing a little green man pops out of me

1364
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:50,209
I'm shooting first and asking questions. Oh, don't worry because they're humans

1365
02:35:50,850 --> 02:35:52,850
You'll be shooting other humans

1366
02:35:53,409 --> 02:36:08,360
Can you sleep at night after that one jack do we have to kill them? Yes

1367
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:12,239
It seems such a waste

1368
02:36:12,639 --> 02:36:18,079
Well, wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than with their meddling permit them to destroy the entire universe

1369
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
We're always right arrows. Of course

1370
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:24,639
But those are not my words

1371
02:36:24,639 --> 02:36:26,639
Those are the words of the ruler

1372
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:29,780
Who is that?

1373
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:37,920
You're not so different you and I

1374
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:41,729
Really the only difference is you got your outfit from party city

1375
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:47,489
And I wear a suit to work. No for the moment. Who's the real weirdo do as I tell you

1376
02:36:55,409 --> 02:36:58,049
You do not need guns. Maybe we think we do

1377
02:36:59,299 --> 02:37:04,020
They would be of no use to you now. They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood

1378
02:37:04,579 --> 02:37:06,819
And you two look like you've got a lot of both

1379
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:12,479
True, they would be effective upon us through

1380
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:20,079
That's true the opportunity to use them mister if you don't get away from that control board i'll show you just how effective

1381
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:26,280
Shall we talk now? All right

1382
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:28,600
Your friends will be here shortly

1383
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:37,250
Those you left at the vehicle if you've done anything to paul. Take it easy. Mr. Trent. Oh, I assure you no harm has come to her

1384
02:37:38,049 --> 02:37:40,479
Would you like to see?

1385
02:37:42,239 --> 02:37:46,079
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board. You're a headstrong young man

1386
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:54,719
I was a cure for every illness in america see her movements. What are you stupid? Go ahead my friend

1387
02:37:55,280 --> 02:38:04,040
But move very carefully only in america apparently

1388
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:15,670
She's only fainted you fiend

1389
02:38:16,930 --> 02:38:24,049
I a fiend. Um, hold on a second. What's going on with his grip on this gun?

1390
02:38:24,129 --> 02:38:28,930
He's this this grip on this gun is like trying to get into the claw of a lobster at red lobster

1391
02:38:30,770 --> 02:38:32,850
Like dude, what is this grip?

1392
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:46,690
She's only fainted

1393
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:49,090
His hands going I

1394
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,280
a fiend

1395
02:38:51,280 --> 02:39:01,639
I feel like that's his hands were made in dreams. I fiend we did not come here as enemies

1396
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:08,579
We came only with friendly intentions to talk to ask your aid our aid

1397
02:39:09,430 --> 02:39:16,979
Yes, your aid for the whole universe, but your governments of earth refused even to accept our existence

1398
02:39:17,889 --> 02:39:23,110
Even though you've seen us heard our messages you still refuse to accept us

1399
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:32,500
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our earth because of death because all you of earth are idiots

1400
02:39:33,489 --> 02:39:41,889
Do you just hold on buster? No, you hold on first was your firecracker a harmless explosive then your hand grenade

1401
02:39:42,549 --> 02:39:49,319
They began to kill your own people a few at a time then the bomb then a larger bomb

1402
02:39:49,809 --> 02:39:58,739
Many people are killed at one time then your scientist stumbled upon the atom bomb split the atom a larger bomb

1403
02:39:58,979 --> 02:40:00,500
Then the hydrogen bomb

1404
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:07,909
Where you actually explode the air itself now brings the total destruction of the entire universe

1405
02:40:08,549 --> 02:40:18,760
Served by our sun the only explosion left is the solar night why there's no such thing perhaps to you

1406
02:40:19,079 --> 02:40:24,819
But we've known it for centuries your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others

1407
02:40:25,139 --> 02:40:31,860
But the juvenile lines which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late

1408
02:40:33,430 --> 02:40:41,540
You're way above our heads the solar night is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight why that's impossible

1409
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:46,040
Even now your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays

1410
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,440
The rays of sunlight are minute particles

1411
02:40:50,079 --> 02:40:51,920
Is it so far from your imagination?

1412
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:56,319
They cannot do as I have suggested why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured

1413
02:40:57,059 --> 02:41:04,100
Can you see or measure an atom? Yes, you can explode one a ray of sunlight is made up of many atoms

1414
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:11,670
So, what if we do develop this solar night bomb we'd be even a stronger nation than now stronger you see you see

1415
02:41:12,069 --> 02:41:17,670
Your stupid minds stupid stupid. That's all i'm taking from you. Get back here you jack

1416
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:28,129
Let him finish he turns green. He's an alien. He was just projecting different skin

1417
02:41:28,209 --> 02:41:33,489
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed headstrong violent

1418
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:39,379
No use of the mind god gave you you talk of god his red blood

1419
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:47,379
You also think it impossible that we too might think of god you guys celebrate easter you

1420
02:41:48,159 --> 02:41:55,569
I do wear the uniform of your country. You see I wear the uniform of my country. Yes

1421
02:41:56,440 --> 02:42:00,760
We've had to use drastic eggs and the bunny and shit, but you left us no alternative

1422
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:12,100
When you have the solar night you have nothing nor does the universe you speak of solar range country

1423
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:17,479
What is it take a can of your gasoline say?

1424
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:27,219
This can of gasoline is the sun now you spread a thin line of it to a ball representing the earth

1425
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:34,120
Now the gasoline represents the sunlight the sun particles here

1426
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:40,049
We saturate the ball with the gasoline the sunlight then we put a flame to the ball

1427
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:46,229
The flame will speedily travel around the earth back along the line of gasoline to the can

1428
02:42:46,790 --> 02:42:53,750
Or the sun itself just like that gta 5 it will explode this source you play that trevor mission spread to every place that gasoline

1429
02:42:53,829 --> 02:43:01,600
Like that sunlight touches explode the sunlight here gentlemen you explode the universe

1430
02:43:03,239 --> 02:43:06,760
Explode the sunlight here and a chain reaction will occur

1431
02:43:07,319 --> 02:43:15,620
Direct to the sun itself true and to all the planets that sunlight touches to every planet in the universe

1432
02:43:17,569 --> 02:43:20,069
This is why you must be stopped

1433
02:43:20,149 --> 02:43:27,909
This is why any means must be used to stop you in a friendly manner or as it seems

1434
02:43:28,979 --> 02:43:30,979
You want this is a v-sauce video

1435
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:37,120
Mad is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves you have done this

1436
02:43:37,959 --> 02:43:41,319
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves?

1437
02:43:41,940 --> 02:43:48,290
You have also done this how then is it mad that one planet must destroy another who threatens the very

1438
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:55,379
She's just saying the same shit you were what in my land women are for advancing the race

1439
02:43:55,860 --> 02:44:00,850
Not for fighting man's battle. Well in our land gas is worthless right now

1440
02:44:00,850 --> 02:44:05,250
So your analogy doesn't make any fucking sense clued is worth like negative 30 dollars bro

1441
02:44:06,209 --> 02:44:23,329
Is for the development of our planet back to the graveyard. We always end up here

1442
02:44:27,090 --> 02:44:29,090
What happened to you? How come you're all alone?

1443
02:44:29,409 --> 02:44:34,319
I asked for lots of help you sounded drunk or something on the radio. I didn't see with my own eyes

1444
02:44:34,399 --> 02:44:39,489
I'd never believe it believe what it was horrible and he almost broke my shoulder

1445
02:44:39,889 --> 02:44:44,290
Look, what are you trying to say? If you don't make sense, we'll never get to the bottom of this now. Who slugged you?

1446
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:51,299
Inspector clay what it was clay. All right, only not like we remembered him

1447
02:44:52,610 --> 02:44:58,719
Well, his leg was busted into I can't even text you tell me you saw skeletons. We did earlier

1448
02:44:59,639 --> 02:45:05,920
Now I know you're off your rocker. All of us saw it lieutenant the colonel everybody. Where's lieutenant now?

1449
02:45:06,629 --> 02:45:10,309
We've got to find him. Mr. Trenor's gone. I was left here to guard her

1450
02:45:10,790 --> 02:45:16,159
But they showed up and put me out of the running and the second time tonight and i'm getting darn tired of it

1451
02:45:16,319 --> 02:45:21,350
Which way were they going off that way? Come on. I don't know. I'm a police officer in every movie

1452
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:33,319
I don't know anything then one day it could all be gone one big puff of smoke and ball of fire

1453
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:37,680
All that out there the stars

1454
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:40,639
the planets

1455
02:45:40,639 --> 02:45:42,639
All of just an empty void

1456
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:49,010
You two had better come along with us come with you. We're gonna arrest an alien police station

1457
02:45:49,649 --> 02:45:52,850
Ha ha ha ha ha

1458
02:45:52,850 --> 02:46:08,930
So it seems you think you have the upper hand look out that window jeb jeb

1459
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,100
Hey jeb come over here jeb

1460
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:19,360
She is unarmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose

1461
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:32,530
I feel like we've crossed this path before yes, we have holy cow. It's the only path in the movie

1462
02:46:33,409 --> 02:46:37,250
Same. Oh my god. I can't I can't even watch this anymore

1463
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:45,799
Look there. It's clay. All right. There's no mistaking that

1464
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:48,360
And he's got mrs. Trent

1465
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:54,520
Get your gun ready from all i've seen tonight guns won't do any good clay is dead and we buried him

1466
02:46:54,920 --> 02:47:00,680
How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead dead and yet there he stands. Well, no, that doesn't make any sense

1467
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:06,280
He hasn't laughed yet and ruined every skit. He's been in that's the only reason i'm listening to you

1468
02:47:09,860 --> 02:47:13,620
Look, i've got an idea heard him or not. We've got to try something

1469
02:47:13,860 --> 02:47:19,540
I'm gonna sneak up behind him and walk him over the head that ought to make a move follow me

1470
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:22,659
Even when clay was alive, he couldn't run. He's over there somewhere

1471
02:47:24,819 --> 02:47:26,899
Run like lightning in the opposite direction

1472
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:35,959
You think it'll work over anything else to try? Oh my god. This is gonna be so funny

1473
02:47:35,959 --> 02:47:37,959
He's gonna have the fucking head

1474
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:51,360
I'll be all right

1475
02:47:51,360 --> 02:47:57,889
Why just gently tapping somebody's what your man told the big one was he dubbing her voice

1476
02:47:58,209 --> 02:48:03,409
Of anything else to try he was just dubbing her voice idea heard him or not

1477
02:48:03,409 --> 02:48:09,010
We've got to try something i'm gonna sneak up behind him and walk him over the head that ought to make a move

1478
02:48:09,969 --> 02:48:13,569
Follow me even when clay was alive. He couldn't run fast enough to catch me

1479
02:48:13,809 --> 02:48:21,090
It took him an hour and 13 minutes run like lightning hit somebody with a stick. You think it'll work of anything else to try

1480
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:47,620
Oh, i'll be all right, take care of the others that's him doing her voice he's practicing

1481
02:48:48,899 --> 02:48:55,969
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off. He'll walk again when I turn it on all that right there

1482
02:48:56,959 --> 02:49:01,360
Suppose the lieutenant and the others are in that thing. Well, they're supposedly they're margins or something in there

1483
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:13,840
Let's go

1484
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:16,280
You're under arrest. We're gonna put you

1485
02:49:17,159 --> 02:49:20,159
Not really punching

1486
02:49:22,129 --> 02:49:24,129
Here's the gun

1487
02:49:40,930 --> 02:49:42,930
I'll have a ship in the air in a minute

1488
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:57,719
What is he doing over there he doesn't know what that is jack stop doing that you're dropping the air pressure in the room

1489
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:06,840
Get out of here jeff the ship's on fire

1490
02:50:15,079 --> 02:50:17,340
Get out of here jeff the ship's on fire

1491
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:19,340
Look at the day

1492
02:50:30,979 --> 02:50:35,059
This is like we're talking about garages that's the electrical meter

1493
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:41,610
That's like they just dog it up a little bit. That's the thing the guy comes to your house to see how much electricity you use

1494
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,239
They added a couple of

1495
02:50:49,239 --> 02:50:52,069
dials to it

1496
02:50:52,069 --> 02:50:56,469
Get out of here man. The ship's on fire. Get out of the garage the garage is on fire

1497
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:59,219
Yeah

1498
02:51:02,389 --> 02:51:05,190
For some reason we decided to turn our grill on in the garage

1499
02:51:05,829 --> 02:51:07,829
We're fucking idiots

1500
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:11,190
You're supposed to use these things outside, man

1501
02:51:17,479 --> 02:51:18,760
Tapiano

1502
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:23,110
They're supposed to use charcoal inside

1503
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:38,940
Was it worth it? Was it worth it? I wonder if that's the last we'll see of that. I don't give a shit about your beyond burgers, mike

1504
02:51:39,899 --> 02:51:41,780
Yeah, gross

1505
02:51:41,780 --> 02:51:44,100
God damn it. You should have been safe. Oh, he's dead

1506
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:50,120
That thing yet?

1507
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:56,600
That's right. There's another ghoul running loose and it's my guess that you'll look like him with the ship and the ray gun gone

1508
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:58,600
They have no control

1509
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:01,940
We gotta hand it to them though. They

1510
02:52:02,260 --> 02:52:09,559
They're far ahead of us

1511
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:18,440
Just open up

1512
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:26,520
Can you prove that it didn't happen

1513
02:52:27,459 --> 02:52:29,590
Perhaps on your way home

1514
02:52:29,590 --> 02:52:35,989
Someone will pass you in the dark and you will never know it for they will be from outer space

1515
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:44,090
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment. We once laughed at the horseless carriage

1516
02:52:44,889 --> 02:52:46,250
the airplane

1517
02:52:46,250 --> 02:52:48,409
the telephone the electric light

1518
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:50,489
vitamins radio

1519
02:52:50,489 --> 02:53:02,969
vitamins radios fiber truck now some of us laugh at outer space in the future

1520
02:53:03,690 --> 02:53:19,180
garage in hollywood, usa

1521
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:26,180
It was that was fucking ridiculous

1522
02:53:27,219 --> 02:53:29,219
What a stupid movie

1523
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:45,290
Those were two back to back those were those were great

1524
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:48,620
Very much worth watching on stream

1525
02:53:49,750 --> 02:53:53,719
I wonder if the next one will hold up the next one could be

1526
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:57,219
Not even close. I don't know

1527
02:53:57,620 --> 02:54:07,020
It's worth a shot though. Ah coming up next we have to close this out. This is the longest one

1528
02:54:09,110 --> 02:54:11,670
This is santa claus conquers the martians

1529
02:54:13,459 --> 02:54:16,420
Uh, this is the longest one. So this is an hour and 20 minutes

1530
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:19,700
and

1531
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:21,780
I don't uh

1532
02:54:21,780 --> 02:54:28,520
Another alien themed one. This is gonna be so fucking bad

1533
02:54:29,239 --> 02:54:31,239
This one sucks, dude

1534
02:54:31,829 --> 02:54:34,549
uh

1535
02:54:34,549 --> 02:54:44,069
Well, we're gonna watch it. It's very boring. Uh

1536
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:59,270
How could you have a boring movie if you're santa claus conquering martians? Let's see what happens

1537
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:09,030
I'm willing to give it a try. It's not what you think. It's terrible. It's terrible

1538
02:55:14,489 --> 02:55:16,059
veto

1539
02:55:16,059 --> 02:55:18,059
Veto i'm veto

1540
02:55:18,139 --> 02:55:28,059
What the fuck? Holy shit

1541
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:34,940
This is unbelievable. This is like the most i've ever seen chat agree

1542
02:55:39,139 --> 02:55:42,700
Oh my god

1543
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:44,500
Okay

1544
02:55:44,500 --> 02:55:50,620
So this is this is bad. Are you sure? Are you sure?

1545
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:57,979
Uh, uh, come along. Mr. Anderson and i'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out. Are you sure?

1546
02:55:58,780 --> 02:56:18,540
Okay. Well, uh, are you guys sure? Are you sure about this? Give it a chance?

1547
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:23,290
Give us a chance

1548
02:56:23,290 --> 02:56:25,850
Watch the first. All right. Let's we're gonna watch the first 10 minutes

1549
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:30,520
If this don't work out then we're gonna move on to another one

1550
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:34,040
and the other one is

1551
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:35,799
Attack of the giant leeches

1552
02:56:35,799 --> 02:56:39,579
Attack of the giant leeches is the one that's up next

1553
02:56:39,979 --> 02:56:49,750
That sounds better

1554
02:56:50,549 --> 02:56:56,250
But what about the santa claus one

1555
02:56:58,790 --> 02:57:01,829
Really? Uh leeches, please. Oh, right

1556
02:57:03,059 --> 02:57:08,069

So that's what the earth people call a city

1632
03:04:29,350 --> 03:04:33,329
How primitive look at all those buildings above ground

1633
03:04:34,370 --> 03:04:37,649
Why we could destroy that city with one blast of our curie

1634
03:04:44,579 --> 03:04:51,379
He's wearing like a beer helmet i'm waiting for the strada going his mouth and to be like, oh those primitive humans

This morning two children disappeared mysteriously from the vicinity of welch lake

1641
03:05:50,370 --> 03:05:55,889
The police have found no clues and it seems as though billy and betty foster have simply vanished into thin air

1642
03:05:56,209 --> 03:06:01,090
This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air while local police are continuing their

1643
03:06:04,770 --> 03:06:11,090
No, sir as a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again

Well, is it all right if I have your chocolate ice cream

1659
03:07:25,989 --> 03:07:27,989

03:07:44,520 --> 03:07:47,100

Terrible thing you killed out there at the swamp

I put five slugs into that critter before it went under

1704
03:14:21,659 --> 03:14:24,379
This thing I've seen

1705
03:14:24,379 --> 03:14:26,459
And regular arms on it like a man

1706
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:29,500
It was sort of different looking

1707
03:14:29,659 --> 03:14:31,659

1716
03:15:06,379 --> 03:15:11,260
Not too bad. You didn't bring it back steve benton probably pay a fair bounty for whatever it was

03:15:13,579 --> 03:15:17,579
I wouldn't touch that critter for all the money ever made

1719
03:15:18,219 --> 03:15:20,379
And if you see that you wouldn't either

1720
03:15:21,100 --> 03:15:23,739
You better take it easy on this stuff. You're looking kind of peeking

1721
03:15:24,620 --> 03:15:29,819
What am I gonna get some real shit in the public domain? I'm gonna clean my otter. I think about this sometimes

1722
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:34,139
Public domain always has just dog shit

1723
03:15:34,540 --> 03:15:38,700
You've been poaching all these years coming back to haunt you frankenstein's the only thing we got

1724
03:15:39,659 --> 03:15:41,659
And attack of the giant fucking leeches

1725
03:15:42,299 --> 03:15:50,139
You better. I'll see it right quick yourself. It's because of disney

1726
03:15:51,579 --> 03:15:55,760
I can't wait to see fucking mickey mouse do all shitty car commercials

1727
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:03,020
It's gonna be fucking crazy

1728
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:06,440
Mickey mouse is gonna be selling insurance

1729
03:16:07,899 --> 03:16:10,139
Just wait when they lose that case in 10 years

1730
03:16:11,459 --> 03:16:13,459
You made that joke before he's a repeater

1731
03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:20,340
And here by the way, here comes the jazz music when uh, there's a lady on the screen and hold on. We might need to

1732
03:16:22,360 --> 03:16:26,600
I need to move this forward about 15 seconds. Look

1733
03:16:27,399 --> 03:16:32,680
It's not like I want to be mean or anything like that. Liz baby. Okay reputation around here

1734
03:16:33,579 --> 03:16:35,579
These folks have no respect slow

1735
03:16:35,979 --> 03:16:37,979
Flutes next thing

1736
03:16:44,219 --> 03:16:46,969
I just got dressed like an opera singer

1737
03:16:57,690 --> 03:17:00,409
This is dick rubbin, okay

1738
03:17:02,329 --> 03:17:15,530
All right, did you tell that there might be a female on the screen?

1739
03:17:23,959 --> 03:17:27,500
There could be a woman on the screen in 1940

1740
03:17:28,059 --> 03:17:42,489
Okay, this is might be a skip scenario touch me you think you're talking to don't touch me

1741
03:17:42,729 --> 03:17:46,250
You're my wife. I'll touch you anytime. I feel like it. They're married

1742
03:17:53,149 --> 03:17:55,149
Where you going?

1743
03:17:55,629 --> 03:18:02,479
This movie sucks

1744
03:18:03,950 --> 03:18:05,870
Maybe i'll be back

1745
03:18:05,870 --> 03:18:07,229
Maybe I won't

1746
03:18:07,229 --> 03:18:09,950
Liz baby, I don't mean nothing listen to me

1747
03:18:10,510 --> 03:18:16,030
I know I know i've been really looking like chef boy rd lately, but you know, i'm good for it

1748
03:18:16,110 --> 03:18:24,680
You know me

1749
03:18:36,399 --> 03:18:42,399
What there was a young one that last trap had to kill it. Oh poor thing. What?

1750
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:47,079
Told you you shouldn't come along

1751
03:18:47,079 --> 03:18:51,719
Turn the lights on. I can't see what's happening. This is the movie man watching a wedding dress

1752
03:18:52,760 --> 03:18:54,760
Oh when she's not suffering those traps

1753
03:18:55,719 --> 03:18:57,159
horrible

1754
03:18:57,159 --> 03:19:00,920
These poachers know the swamps like the back of their hands, but i'll catch one of them. Yeah

1755
03:19:04,120 --> 03:19:06,120
I'll have to be satisfied confiscating

1756
03:19:07,719 --> 03:19:09,719
Trap

1757
03:19:10,920 --> 03:19:15,479
These people aren't like other folks, you know, they'll try and get back at you let them try

1758
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:22,600
Steve you're a stranger here. They've lived this way for generations one man isn't going to change them overnight

1759
03:19:23,239 --> 03:19:25,639
You're a real worry ward. I'm serious

1760
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:28,360
They can be dangerous

1761
03:19:28,360 --> 03:19:30,360
Shut up you drunk. I'll be careful. What?

1762
03:19:30,840 --> 03:19:38,139
You just all right

1763
03:19:38,860 --> 03:19:42,829
Steve I love you. I love you so much

1764
03:19:43,549 --> 03:20:29,340
What was that

1765
03:20:29,420 --> 03:20:31,500
Was eating cereal listen benton

1766
03:20:32,139 --> 03:20:34,299
What is he eating that beef stew?

1767
03:20:35,180 --> 03:20:41,340
As far as this office is concerned at the end of but sure if I can't see whether lem was killed by anything human

1768
03:20:41,420 --> 03:20:43,420
I wouldn't need you to tell me my job

1769
03:20:43,899 --> 03:20:47,500
And i'm not about to go tromping through the swamp looking for an overgrown gator

1770
03:20:48,219 --> 03:20:55,819
Saw your wasn't killed by an alligator. Is that so did you hear that morton game warden benton says it wasn't a gator kill lem

1771
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:57,899
Well, then what was it?

1772
03:20:57,899 --> 03:21:03,819
You know, you can't veto movie halfway through it. Dr. Grayson said it's been it's been like two hours

1773
03:21:04,540 --> 03:21:11,659
How has it been? Oh sure. How has it been 10 minutes? It's been three hours 30 miles inland living in clear water

1774
03:21:12,219 --> 03:21:14,540
Stranger things have happened. I know I care benton

1775
03:21:15,180 --> 03:21:17,180
You work for the state

1776
03:21:17,340 --> 03:21:21,420
Now, why don't you keep your nose out of county business? Is that clear enough for you? Oh, we're staying

1777
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:24,600
Oh go soak your fat head

1778
03:21:25,239 --> 03:21:27,239
What

1779
03:21:28,010 --> 03:21:32,729
What was that you said oh go soak your fat head go soak your fat head

1780
03:21:36,649 --> 03:21:39,930
Okay, go soak your fat head trouble

1781
03:21:40,969 --> 03:21:42,969
And he's sure going to get it

1782
03:21:43,129 --> 03:21:45,200
You can bet on that

1783
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:57,100
There's a good thing. He's 11. Otherwise, I would have been really mad at him. The octopi uses its suction discs to hold its prey

1784
03:21:57,659 --> 03:22:01,819
Now in itself the disc will not inflict a wound same is true of the squid

1785
03:22:02,219 --> 03:22:08,860
Now both creatures have a parrot-like beak as their primary offensive and defensive weapon. Well, maybe the sheriff was right there

1786
03:22:10,909 --> 03:22:13,569
Could be a freak or a malformed alligator

1787
03:22:14,750 --> 03:22:16,110
No

1788
03:22:16,110 --> 03:22:18,030
No, i'm afraid it wasn't

1789
03:22:18,030 --> 03:22:20,719
Well, where does that leave us doc?

1790
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:23,530
I wish I knew

1791
03:22:23,530 --> 03:22:26,569
You know, i'm beginning to think lem was telling the truth in warper store

1792
03:22:27,450 --> 03:22:29,450
He did see something that night

1793
03:22:30,010 --> 03:22:33,850
Something that had intelligence enough to seek him out destroy him late. Thanks for the tea

1794
03:22:34,170 --> 03:22:38,569
Sorry, I'm going to have killed the thing this guy's jack a dozen rifle bullets. Look at this guy's fucking arms

1795
03:22:38,649 --> 03:22:42,489
I've seen that old 44 40 years. Nothing could live after being hit with those slugs

1796
03:22:43,530 --> 03:22:45,159
well

1797
03:22:45,159 --> 03:22:47,559
Conceiving the possibility of one such creature

1798
03:22:48,360 --> 03:22:50,840
We must also concede the possibility of others

1799
03:22:52,780 --> 03:22:57,180
Oh, there's one sure way of finding out go in and search every backwater channel and what's button this one if it's there i'll find it

1800
03:23:30,399 --> 03:23:45,040
Well, whatever it was it's not here anymore

1801
03:23:46,479 --> 03:23:51,440
Do you want some coffee? Yeah. Thanks, son. I know I could hide in here and never be noticed one did

1802
03:23:52,399 --> 03:23:57,520
The seminal was on osio in 1830s with the u.s army two years around them up. I remember reading about osio in high school two years

1803
03:23:58,479 --> 03:24:01,520
It's only been out of two days and I feel worn out. Well, I might as well keep on looking around

1804
03:24:02,239 --> 03:24:05,629
This movie's so bad

1805
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:11,479
What do you want me to do? It's like this is the second movie we tried this is the second finale

1806
03:24:12,360 --> 03:24:23,370
This is finale two. I

1807
03:24:24,409 --> 03:24:34,620
Want more ritz brothers. I me too. I know I really do

1808
03:24:47,360 --> 03:24:52,159
Got an interesting scene. Hold on. Can't you think of anything else? Say stupid? I gotta get this order over miss chauvin

1809
03:24:52,239 --> 03:24:54,239
She's one of my better customers

1810
03:24:54,559 --> 03:24:56,159
Can't keep awaiting

1811
03:24:56,159 --> 03:24:58,159
This is fat han solo

1812
03:24:58,319 --> 03:25:00,319
I love you. Are you talking about?

1813
03:25:01,930 --> 03:25:11,209

03:25:13,280 --> 03:25:15,280
Where are the leeches?

1815
03:25:18,559 --> 03:25:20,559
I played half life. I love the physics

1816
03:25:21,520 --> 03:25:24,000
It's fun to play with stuff have some trouble day

1817
03:25:25,129 --> 03:25:28,809
And you know women cal gotta get the hair down every now and then

1818
03:25:30,139 --> 03:25:32,459
You sure don't know an awful lot about females

1819
03:25:33,440 --> 03:25:37,920
I gotta hand it to you. Is that all his stuff? I can't stand here. John cal. Yeah

About this time an elbow macaroni. Yeah, it's all my stuff frank ever since limb got itself killed

1822
03:25:47,680 --> 03:25:50,559
I don't own anything else to sell out and move into town

1823
03:25:51,639 --> 03:25:53,639
Don't you let her bamboozle you dave?

1824
03:25:54,040 --> 03:25:56,040
You keep her right here in the store

1825

Eyes pop out of something

1878
03:33:56,350 --> 03:34:03,629
That's appeared next to head his steam blows out slams fist on table rattling any plates or bolts

1879
03:34:06,770 --> 03:34:08,770
Fireworks

1880
03:34:09,809 --> 03:34:11,809
There ain't nothing down here sir

1881
03:34:13,729 --> 03:34:15,729
Well i'm getting tired of this

1882
03:34:15,889 --> 03:34:28,979
Uh, come on in boys well if there's any bodies out there we'd have found them guys I want some straight answers walter

1883
03:34:36,319 --> 03:34:38,399
I want to see the leech. Oh my god. My head hurts

1884
03:34:39,440 --> 03:34:56,850
Come on out of there. All right. Yeah, stop stop. Stop. So I read it. I got it. I got it

1885
03:34:57,409 --> 03:35:13,469
What is it? I can't see it

1886
03:35:16,690 --> 03:35:19,329
Just one of the scaring them bodies are still in there

1887
03:35:19,809 --> 03:35:24,530
You can bet some old bull gators got him stuffed in his cave under the bank

1888
03:35:25,170 --> 03:35:29,969
Letting him ripen up for a few days. Oh my god. My head hurts from laughing. Yeah. Well

1889
03:35:30,930 --> 03:35:35,329
What was it leech some long cypress poles to go man pulled the gator cave

1890
03:35:40,530 --> 03:35:44,049
Too far forward how what

1891
03:35:44,370 --> 03:35:51,200
It's about two seconds

1892
03:35:51,200 --> 03:35:53,200
I'm sorry doc. I can't do it

1893
03:35:53,280 --> 03:35:56,639
Wait, who's dead? I had to do it myself wouldn't want to have to arrest you doc

1894
03:35:56,639 --> 03:36:00,959
But I will if I find you near the preserve with any explosives. Why is he 5 000 feet away?

1895
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:03,040
Sorry, nan. That's the way it's got to be

1896
03:36:03,440 --> 03:36:06,319
He's right, man. It's his job to protect wildlife

1897
03:36:06,879 --> 03:36:08,879
What about he's two miles away?

1898
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:11,600
Three people have been killed in that game preserve

1899
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:13,600
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

1900
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:20,239
Nan try to understand if I could be sure something in the swamp was responsible for those deaths. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

1901
03:36:20,959 --> 03:36:25,120
We've been together the last three days was hanging a trace of anything unusual

1902
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:29,360
Not so much as a suggestion of any form of life unknown to us

1903
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:31,200
steve

1904
03:36:31,200 --> 03:36:35,760
Shot and killed those people. All right. I'll admit for your death left a lot of questions unanswered

1905
03:36:36,399 --> 03:36:39,920
But you can bet your bottom dollar the other two died from dave walker's shotgun

1906
03:36:40,399 --> 03:36:46,559
Do you really believe that figure it out psycho walker the cartoon noises that came out of his gun swamps after he found him

1907
03:36:46,559 --> 03:36:50,559
How could you trust him after that? He shot them and he tried to place the blame on sawyer's dt's

1908
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:56,399
If sawyer told of seeing a purple giraffes with polka dot tails walker would have claimed they did it

1909
03:36:57,200 --> 03:36:59,200
There's one argument against that steve

1910
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:03,600
Dave walker wasn't the kind of a man to hang himself. Not even with two murder charges against him

1911
03:37:04,159 --> 03:37:06,879
I talked with dave less than an hour before he killed himself

1912
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:11,760
That man best part of this movie was the dick rubbin name. I've seen frightened men before terrified men

1913
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:16,079
Yeah, i've never seen anything to compare with the horror and the fear in walker's eyes

1914
03:37:17,010 --> 03:37:20,129
Well, he realized what he'd done and killed two people. That's the highlight

1915
03:37:21,379 --> 03:37:26,180
Oh look doc nan and I were all over that swamp god damn it. Why didn't these monsters attack us?

1916
03:37:26,500 --> 03:37:29,469
I've been thinking about that. They're probably night creatures

1917
03:37:29,790 --> 03:37:32,510
They can't stand the light they stay down near the bottom during the day

1918
03:37:33,860 --> 03:37:43,569
A small charge would stun him bring him to the surface can't buy doc. You're pigheaded steve benton stubborn and pigheaded

1919
03:37:44,850 --> 03:37:53,620
You just don't understand do you?

1920
03:37:54,979 --> 03:38:10,370
Good night doc. What's that? What what what?

1921
03:38:10,530 --> 03:38:43,299
What viewers plummeting i've read one person they said please put parts on and I was like no

1922
03:38:43,299 --> 03:38:45,299
But then that one person had power

1923
03:39:05,760 --> 03:39:07,760
I can't take this anymore

1924
03:39:19,729 --> 03:39:26,979
Uh, well, we can't we can't skip it when I started I started watching I can't oh that's comedy fucking liquor

1925
03:39:27,459 --> 03:39:29,459
Boy, that makes me happy

1926
03:39:29,940 --> 03:39:34,909
Okay, i'm gonna keep it on

1927
03:39:34,909 --> 03:39:38,930
Right unseasonable

1928
03:39:38,930 --> 03:39:40,930
So it's funny, huh?

1929
03:39:41,250 --> 03:39:46,379
Didn't you notice anything? No, what we've been prodding around you all morning

1930
03:39:47,100 --> 03:39:49,100
Ain't run across a single gator

1931
03:39:50,739 --> 03:39:55,700
By rights is this fool should be calling with him. So funny. Yeah, that is funny. I like looks

1932
03:39:56,180 --> 03:39:58,739
Let's call it day. Well, wait a minute. Wait, we ain't gonna hold around the bend yet

1933
03:39:58,819 --> 03:40:02,819
You do what you want. Just get me on dry land and right quick. All right. I know you're getting all hit up. Let's go

1934
03:40:06,350 --> 03:40:08,350
A huge canoe, holy shit

1935
03:40:08,829 --> 03:40:11,969
Out here

1936
03:40:14,049 --> 03:40:22,180
Action

1937
03:40:22,420 --> 03:40:35,760
What's normal what's normal wait I think

1938
03:40:43,360 --> 03:40:45,360
It's just trash bags

1939
03:40:46,430 --> 03:40:48,430
sentient trash bags

1940
03:40:50,450 --> 03:41:08,420
tending

1941
03:41:08,420 --> 03:41:21,680
Fuck it's kind of fucked up actually

1942
03:41:22,559 --> 03:41:54,049
Yes, they're getting eaten actually kind of scary. Yeah actually kind of calling but there's been no answer

1943
03:41:54,209 --> 03:41:59,409
Why I just got back what seems to be the trouble haven't you heard? Okay. Kylo Ren relax

1944
03:42:00,290 --> 03:42:01,729
Disappeared

1945
03:42:01,729 --> 03:42:08,819
Come on inside

1946
03:42:08,899 --> 03:42:10,719
You know covis

1947
03:42:10,719 --> 03:42:13,920
Nothing would please him more than to have all the swamp people disappear

1948
03:42:14,639 --> 03:42:16,639
Swamp trash he calls them

1949
03:42:16,719 --> 03:42:20,719
Strange they have about as much regard for him as he has for them

1950
03:42:21,680 --> 03:42:23,680
When they're worried enough to go to him

1951
03:42:24,239 --> 03:42:26,239
You know something's wrong

1952
03:42:26,319 --> 03:42:30,879
Mrs. Reed said the men went searching for cow and mrs walker's bodies and they never returned

1953
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:35,680
Cobra says he'll get up a search party if they don't show up in a couple of days person's name

1954
03:42:37,260 --> 03:42:40,299
Doc you and then take your car and get as many volunteers as you can

1955
03:42:40,940 --> 03:42:45,340
Tell them to meet me at the old wagon road. I'll call doc evans and have him bring his dogs

1956
03:42:46,940 --> 03:42:51,100
Either they're lost or they've had an accident. God damn it so much more. I hope to heaven you're right

1957
03:43:02,899 --> 03:43:04,899
Dude veto, please

1958
03:43:22,850 --> 03:43:29,440
I've been around here. It's the same scene

1959
03:44:03,899 --> 03:44:05,500
Carry that lady

1960
03:44:05,500 --> 03:44:10,979
All ladies need to be carried in movies from the 30s through the 60s. They can't even walk

1961
03:44:11,920 --> 03:44:13,920
Women can't walk. Did you know that?

1962
03:44:14,620 --> 03:44:17,899
From 1930 to 1960 females couldn't walk

1963
03:44:18,620 --> 03:44:34,940
There was no time. Wait, is that a wiley coyote explosion machine?

1964
03:44:36,239 --> 03:44:39,920
Sure used enough stuff to do the job mike. I used 100 sticks or 40 percent

1965
03:44:40,159 --> 03:44:44,540
I'll blow the bottom right out. All right, let her go. Oh, no

1966
03:44:44,780 --> 03:44:46,780
I've done enough of your dirty work

1967
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:48,379
Help yourself

1968
03:44:48,379 --> 03:44:51,579
But is he presses the button?

1969
03:44:57,340 --> 03:45:18,750
Well, the worst part about this jack is that's one lake out of about 16 000 in the united states

1970
03:45:18,909 --> 03:45:22,020
We're gonna have to go all over

1971
03:45:22,020 --> 03:45:38,270
They're everywhere man. We didn't win shit. This dude is fucking hairy. Whoa

1972
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:42,159
Whoa, i'm this is a serious. Whoa

1973
03:45:42,799 --> 03:45:44,770
What?

1974
03:45:44,770 --> 03:45:46,770
This dude is fucking hairy

1975
03:45:50,209 --> 03:45:55,549
Uh, I'm I mean really like really hair down here on your stomach

1976
03:45:56,829 --> 03:46:01,409
Holy shit

1977
03:46:01,409 --> 03:46:07,629
I don't have that

1978
03:46:07,629 --> 03:46:12,500
What do you mean? That's normal. No, I don't have that shit

1979
03:46:13,059 --> 03:46:17,120
I've got a line going from my belly button down to my uh, my brain is

1980
03:46:17,760 --> 03:46:20,190
What's that sad? Nothing?

1981
03:46:20,430 --> 03:46:24,059
What do you mean manlit?

1982
03:46:24,379 --> 03:46:32,319
You have hair here on your obliques. No, you don't

1983
03:46:34,850 --> 03:46:37,219
Who has fucking hair on their obliques?

1984
03:46:39,700 --> 03:46:41,680
Yes

1985
03:46:41,680 --> 03:46:43,760
I don't believe I don't believe you. Oh shit spoilers

1986
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:51,040
But meanwhile at the pentagon in washington dc

1987
03:46:56,750 --> 03:46:58,219
All right

1988
03:46:58,219 --> 03:52:02,850
Uh, i'm gonna go pee come back and we're gonna watch some three stooges. Hope to see you there. Okay. Hello

1989
03:52:03,250 --> 03:52:18,299
We're gonna watch captain alex. Uh, i've already seen captain alex. So I already seen it. All right, so three stooges

1990
03:52:22,219 --> 03:52:24,219
What are we gonna watch for the three stooges?

1991
03:52:24,620 --> 03:52:30,000
You haven't watched it with us

1992
03:52:30,079 --> 03:52:44,049
I mean, that's true. But okay. This is uh, the three stooges punch drunks

1993
03:52:45,899 --> 03:52:55,250
I wonder we'll give it a try. This is probably the last thing we do tonight before we just chill and hang out

1994
03:52:56,379 --> 03:53:01,979
I gotta ask you though very very important question. Would you hold on?

1995
03:53:12,260 --> 03:53:20,000
Hold on. This is the first time we've done this

1996
03:53:21,379 --> 03:53:28,590
Do you want to do this again? Would you like to do this again?

1997
03:53:29,229 --> 03:53:32,270
With other public domain movies if you'd like to please vote on that poll

1998
03:53:33,360 --> 03:53:35,040
If not, then let me know

1999
03:53:35,040 --> 03:53:42,639
This is a trial run

2000
03:53:42,639 --> 03:53:44,639
Not every week. No, no, no, it'd be like once a month

2001
03:53:46,670 --> 03:53:48,670
That's pretty that's a lot

2002
03:53:50,270 --> 03:53:55,010
That's 94 percent to six. That's a lot of people

2003
03:53:59,389 --> 03:54:00,610
Okay

2004
03:54:00,610 --> 03:54:02,610
Uh, so we'll get more ritz brothers movies

2005
03:54:04,430 --> 03:54:06,430

2006
03:54:06,909 --> 03:54:08,340

03:54:08,340 --> 03:54:10,579
Uh, I don't think you can the nose are gonna climb back

2008
03:54:11,520 --> 03:54:17,229
At this point

2009
03:54:17,229 --> 03:54:19,920
Uh, this has been a lot of fun though

2010
03:54:19,920 --> 03:54:23,600
I'm very very happy with this the first two movies were fucking incredible

2011
03:54:24,239 --> 03:54:26,239
And then we played some fart noises, you know

2012
03:54:27,139 --> 03:54:34,290
Uh, this is called the three stooges and punch drunks. Let's check this one out and this will take us to the end

03:55:15,250 --> 03:55:17,809
Probably where's our cut from last night's show?

2020
03:55:18,209 --> 03:55:21,329
Yeah, the only cut i've got so far is this one over my eye

2021
03:55:22,049 --> 03:55:25,899

What the fuck?

2029
03:56:00,989 --> 03:56:04,030
Wait a minute. Where have you been out to lunch?

Four slices of burnt toast and a rotten egg

2033

04:21:36,799 --> 04:21:56,000
Why would delete save?

2199
04:21:56,000 --> 04:21:58,799
Why would delete safe be right on that menu?

2200
04:22:32,270 --> 04:22:40,180
Veto? Yeah, veto this. Give me the fuck out of here. I'm done. I don't care. I'm done. Fuck. Fuck that game.

2201
04:22:40,340 --> 04:22:42,340
Fuck everything about that game. Who cares?

2202
04:22:43,100 --> 04:22:46,239
Okay. Um, oh, that's it. I'll see you tomorrow.

2203
04:22:47,250 --> 04:23:02,000
Oh, whatever. I'll see you in a couple days. See you in a few days. See you on uh, see you on Monday.

2204
04:23:02,909 --> 04:23:06,239
Yeah, see you on Monday. I'm done.

2205
04:23:10,159 --> 04:23:16,879
The easy bake oven stream. Yeah, hold on. I know that people are waiting for this.

2206
04:23:18,319 --> 04:23:20,319
Uh, it turns out something interesting.

2207
04:23:22,299 --> 04:23:25,020
A bunch of the recipes that I ordered have not come in yet.

2208
04:23:26,190 --> 04:23:29,739
Uh,

2209
04:23:29,739 --> 04:23:34,129
I have 15 easy bake oven recipes. They're still shipping. Still.

2210
04:23:35,280 --> 04:23:39,649
Um, so we can't do that tomorrow.

2211
04:23:44,079 --> 04:23:46,719
I'm sorry to say.

2212
04:23:46,719 --> 04:23:48,719
I'm so upset this stream sucks. What?

2213
04:23:49,489 --> 04:23:58,129
Ban that person for like a month.

2214
04:23:58,129 --> 04:24:07,139
Uh, stream blows. Stream sucks. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. He's right. No, he's not. Get out.

2215
04:24:09,389 --> 04:24:11,069
Fuck you, Jerma. Hey.

2216
04:24:11,069 --> 04:24:16,319
We're rioting?

2217
04:24:17,090 --> 04:24:20,290
It's been four and a half hours. You guys know the fucking costochondritis rules.

2218
04:24:20,930 --> 04:24:25,340
I have costochondritis rules.

2219
04:24:27,010 --> 04:24:32,590
No stream can be more than four or five hours. You know that, right? Come on. Don't riot.

2220
04:24:40,049 --> 04:24:42,930
Chat, you're killing him.

2221
04:24:42,930 --> 04:24:44,850
You said four to six.

2222
04:24:44,850 --> 04:24:48,620
Yeah, it's been four and a half. I'm gonna spend like half an hour 40 minutes in the hanging out with you guys.

2223
04:24:48,620 --> 04:24:49,899
What are you talking about?

2224
04:24:49,899 --> 04:24:52,139
Can I ban chat?

2225
04:24:52,139 --> 04:24:56,020
Hey, uh, wait, wait, wait. Who said that? Link?

2226
04:24:57,280 --> 04:25:00,319
Link, do me a favor. What movies can I watch on stream that don't have to be

2227
04:25:00,879 --> 04:25:02,879
on the terrible service that you guys have?

2228
04:25:04,829 --> 04:25:07,709
What movies can I watch that aren't on that awful service?

2229
04:25:09,250 --> 04:25:11,250
They're like, please watch Jack Ryan

2230
04:25:11,809 --> 04:25:12,770
service.

2231
04:25:12,770 --> 04:25:16,750
What can I watch?

2232
04:25:16,750 --> 04:25:22,110
What can I watch besides please god fucking please god watch Jack Ryan? What can I watch?

2233
04:25:22,430 --> 04:25:38,239
Fuck, am I gonna get in trouble? I don't know. Don't ban me. Don't ban me.

2234
04:25:38,879 --> 04:25:43,440
That was rude.

2235
04:25:43,440 --> 04:25:44,559
Was it?

2236
04:25:44,559 --> 04:25:48,159
I want to watch movies and tv shows with my friends.

2237
04:25:49,680 --> 04:25:53,280
Are they your friends? Yes. Are you sure? That sounds kind of parasocial.

2238
04:25:54,319 --> 04:26:11,969
Quiet.

2239
04:26:11,969 --> 04:26:20,420
He's using us. What the fuck? What are you talking about? Uh, but for real, no, no joking around.

2240
04:26:21,680 --> 04:26:23,700
That was a lot of fun.

2241
04:26:23,700 --> 04:26:26,739
I would love to do that again.

2242
04:26:26,739 --> 04:26:31,819
Stream tomorrow. I can't stream tomorrow. I gotta take a bath.

2243
04:26:39,950 --> 04:26:41,950
Worst one guy moment all day.

2244
04:26:48,579 --> 04:26:49,540
I'll...

2245
04:26:49,540 --> 04:26:55,469
Listen, I'll be back on Monday.

2246
04:26:56,559 --> 04:27:00,719
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then probably Thursday and hopefully Easy Bake Oven happens.

2247
04:27:02,559 --> 04:27:05,489
Easy Bake Oven.

2248
04:27:05,489 --> 04:27:07,489
Amazon doesn't have...

2249
04:27:07,569 --> 04:27:12,989
Amazon has like pretend dates that they're sending shit because of the coronavirus.

2250
04:27:13,549 --> 04:27:23,329
I ordered shit and it doesn't know when it's gonna come in. That's real. I can't... I don't know what to...

2251
04:27:23,409 --> 04:27:25,010
What do I... I don't know what to do.

2252
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:39,629
I didn't say five days a week. I said four. What's today? Friday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday, Saturday.

2253
04:27:39,870 --> 04:27:44,700
It's been six days in the last seven days. What are you talking about? I didn't say seven days a week.

2254
04:27:54,500 --> 04:27:58,620
Six days.

2255
04:27:58,620 --> 04:28:04,299
You said more streams, but shorter. Yeah, and it's been... we've streamed like eight in the last ten days.

2256
04:28:09,889 --> 04:28:23,780
He's gaslighting us? No, you're gaslighting me. That's literally no. What? Let me see. Let me see.

2257
04:28:24,579 --> 04:28:28,500
He's a liar. Let me see if I'm a liar or not. Let me see.

2258
04:28:29,659 --> 04:28:39,620
You're my witch. No, you're my twitch. Let's see. He's lying. He's a lying streamer. He's a liar.

2259
04:28:40,260 --> 04:28:43,069
I don't think I'm a liar. Let's see.

2260
04:28:44,909 --> 04:28:50,540
Shut up, you fucking idiot. All right, let's go to videos.

2261
04:28:50,620 --> 04:28:59,780
What was the last week? I streamed like six times the last like seven or eight days, right? Let's find out.

2262
04:29:00,770 --> 04:29:03,100
Okay, one, two, three.

2263
04:29:03,100 --> 04:29:05,569
Five days ago.

2264
04:29:05,569 --> 04:29:10,209
Six, seven days ago. All right, so one, two, three. I've seen six of the last nine days.

2265
04:29:10,770 --> 04:29:24,450
What? What the heck?

2266
04:29:24,770 --> 04:29:30,139
That's not a lie. That's real.

2267
04:29:31,780 --> 04:29:37,680
He's fudging the numbers. I'll be back on Monday. That's two days from now and I think it's gonna be hilarious.

2268
04:29:40,379 --> 04:29:45,280
Four out of 20 days? What? What is this?

2269
04:29:48,690 --> 04:29:51,120
Oh, that's public domain movie night. That's what we just did.

2270
04:30:00,909 --> 04:30:03,629
He's drunk? I... yeah, I kind of am.

2271
04:30:04,270 --> 04:30:07,420
What do you want me to lie to you?

2272
04:30:07,420 --> 04:30:10,860
No, I'm not. I've had like five vodka cocktails.

2273
04:30:12,190 --> 04:30:14,190
Yeah, I have. Yeah, I am.

2274
04:30:15,229 --> 04:30:43,940
Yeah, what am I gonna lie to you? Put on the face cam? Sure. The webcam doesn't want to get captured.

2275
04:30:44,899 --> 04:31:18,989
Oh, I unplugged it. I can't... I can't get it to load.

2276
04:31:20,190 --> 04:31:22,750
This thing sucks.

2277
04:31:22,750 --> 04:31:25,379
Oh, wait. No, no, this is another camera.

2278
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:45,090
Okay.

2279
04:31:45,090 --> 04:32:04,670
This... I'm here. You look like a villain. That's fine. Greasy teeth?

2280
04:32:13,010 --> 04:32:25,969
Ah, they're right. I don't know how you're right, but you are. All right. See you on Monday. I had a ton of fun tonight.

2281
04:32:29,219 --> 04:32:31,219
Perfect time for TF2. Why would I... what...

2282
04:32:31,620 --> 04:32:37,790
All right, the next game that somebody fucking says in the chat, I'll play it right now. What is it? What is it? Say it!

2283
04:32:44,129 --> 04:33:09,919
Oh, fuck. TF2. This is gonna take like two hours to download.

2284
04:33:20,110 --> 04:33:22,909
Nah, this is gonna take like three hours to download. Uh, it's not gonna work.

2285
04:33:23,389 --> 04:33:39,119
I'm not gonna play jump. No. All right. I'm out of here. I'm gonna take a fucking bath. I'll see you on Monday.

2286
04:33:39,360 --> 04:33:48,700
All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll see you on Monday.

2287
04:33:50,720 --> 04:33:58,209
Uh, for Gotcha Force. Gotcha Force on Monday!

2288
04:33:59,810 --> 04:34:01,569
You look greasy. Do...

2289
04:34:01,569 --> 04:34:07,939
No, it's the light. The light makes me look fucked up.

2290
04:34:08,580 --> 04:34:19,709
You're drunk? No, I'm... yeah, I am. What? I don't know. Yes, I am. Okay. Good night.

2291
04:34:21,840 --> 04:34:25,599
Uh, that was so much like for real. No like joking around. That was a ton of fucking fun.

2292
04:34:25,919 --> 04:34:30,319
I had so much fucking fun. We will do this again.

2293
04:34:30,799 --> 04:34:40,979
Without a doubt. That was a ton of fun. I had a blast. Hope you did too. He's a wine mom. No. Yeah, whatever.

2294
04:34:41,060 --> 04:34:49,409
I'm fucking 35 this year. Get over it. Uh, why can't I...

2295
04:34:57,060 --> 04:35:04,020
There it is. Let's do the bits!

2296
04:35:04,020 --> 04:35:07,139
Why are you so old? How did that happen? I don't know, man. I just did.

2297
04:35:07,619 --> 04:35:15,330
It just hap- it fucking happened. I'm 35 this year. I know. It's been 10 years. I've been doing this for 10 years.

2298
04:35:19,169 --> 04:35:25,119
That was a lot of fun. Thanks for joining me. I will see you guys on Monday.

2299
04:35:26,240 --> 04:35:31,069
For more fucking funny stuff. We're gonna play Gotcha Force.

2300
04:35:31,709 --> 04:35:33,950
One of my favorite GameCube games ever.

2301
04:35:34,959 --> 04:35:39,950
You'll see why. It was two hundred and fifty dollars. Gotcha Force was

2302
04:35:40,110 --> 04:35:45,389
two hundred and fifty fucking dollars. I hope you like it.

2303
04:35:50,099 --> 04:35:56,900
Hey, Charlie is okay. Thanks for three dollars. Did someone say movie night? They did. Me and you.

2304
04:35:58,860 --> 04:36:06,610
Thank you, Snake Cowboy for the ten community subs. Ten subs. Thank you.

2305
04:36:07,729 --> 04:36:13,729
Uh, Orofarynx. Thanks for threes subs. That's not- it's three dollars actually. Thanks to three hundred bits.

2306
04:36:14,959 --> 04:36:22,860
I'm recovering from coronavirus. And even though laughing makes my chest worse, your streams have helped me keep my head up.

2307
04:36:23,020 --> 04:36:36,139
Thanks for all you do. Hopefully you recover really soon. Take care of yourself. Drink lots of water and stay isolated.

2308
04:36:38,799 --> 04:36:45,659
Thanks for the three dollars. Hey, Vic for First Noble. Thanks for five dollars.

2309
04:36:46,900 --> 04:36:49,939
If the gorilla is so smart, how come it's a gorilla and not a human?

2310
04:36:52,340 --> 04:37:01,340
Because the movie was made in 1939. They didn't fucking understand anything. They knew smoke cigarettes and break walls.

2311
04:37:01,659 --> 04:37:07,009
That's what they did. Hey, Banjo Boy. Thanks for two fifty. Fun fact.

2312
04:37:07,979 --> 04:37:13,419
Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was the first appearance of Mrs. Claus in any media.

2313
04:37:14,639 --> 04:37:21,090
Really? Most people think that the claymation Rudolph holds this title, but no.

2314
04:37:21,569 --> 04:37:27,310
Santa Claus Conquers the Martians came out a couple months before. I've watched this movie like 18 times.

2315
04:37:27,790 --> 04:37:35,520
I have no idea why. It was fun watching with you though. Thanks for a fun night. We barely watched it, but.

2316
04:37:38,560 --> 04:37:43,900
Atlanteus, thanks for ten dollars. Here are your royalties for my use of the Rat Birthday song

2317
04:37:45,229 --> 04:37:51,060
when I wash my hands.

2318
04:37:51,060 --> 04:37:59,099
Uh, that that song is free. You don't have to pay me money. That song is free, but thanks for the thousand bits.

2319
04:37:59,419 --> 04:38:05,119
Hey freak out. Thanks for the five dollars. Jerma, if you want some old dramatic movies,

2320
04:38:05,119 --> 04:38:09,470
you should watch Twelve Angry Men for the best years of our lives.

2321
04:38:09,869 --> 04:38:15,819
Or if you want something to watch in your personal time, watch a thing that could be porn.

2322
04:38:16,220 --> 04:38:26,689
And I'm not going to say it out loud. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, uh, Uber Morph Point.

2323
04:38:26,849 --> 04:38:34,990
Thanks for fifteen dollars, Uber Morph Point. If you do another one of these, you should watch Who Killed Captain Alex?

2324
04:38:35,310 --> 04:38:42,610
I've seen it. Uh, Ugandan Action Movie Free on YouTube. I've seen that whole movie. It's fantastic.

2325
04:38:42,849 --> 04:38:54,659
I'd like to see things on movie night that I've never seen. Things that I've never seen before. I've seen that one.

2326
04:38:59,619 --> 04:39:06,319
Uh, Dr. Zutsu, thanks for the seven dollars. Hey Jerma, glad this stream schedule is coming back together.

2327
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:12,060
Stuff is really wild and stressful for everyone right now, and I'm glad stuff is working out for you enough

2328
04:39:12,540 --> 04:39:17,060
that you can stream again. I've been stressed recently since I started school again.

2329
04:39:17,060 --> 04:39:26,049
I can't believe I played Jump King for ten seconds and deleted the whole save. That's, that sucks.

2330
04:39:26,930 --> 04:39:34,159
Um, since I started school again and my design is one of the 25 finalists in the Terraria Vanity Contest,

2331
04:39:35,840 --> 04:39:40,639
if I win and you ever play Terraria again, my design is the TV head outfit.

2332
04:39:41,520 --> 04:39:51,330
Thanks for streaming. Thanks for the seven bucks. Terraria is a great game. That'd be fucking cool

2333
04:39:51,330 --> 04:39:56,110
if you got some shit in it. Can't believe I deleted my whole save account on Jump King.

2334
04:39:56,349 --> 04:40:05,630
Thanks for the seven bucks. Peaceful Haley, 250 from Peaceful Haley. So happy you're doing a movie night.

2335
04:40:05,630 --> 04:40:10,029
The riffing makes it even better. Thanks for being entertaining. Good night, Jerma, and chat.

2336
04:40:11,970 --> 04:40:17,819
Uh, I think it was a success. I had a lot of fun. I'm having a great time. Like, this has been fucking,

2337
04:40:17,819 --> 04:40:19,340
this has been a blast. I hope you had fun.

2338
04:40:25,630 --> 04:40:35,439
Thanks for the 350. Bella Lisosy was a master theater and movie actor in the 20s and early 30s,

2339
04:40:35,439 --> 04:40:41,380
and extremely popular thanks to his role in Dracula. The Gorilla was filmed in the period

2340
04:40:41,380 --> 04:40:48,770
when his career was on the decline and was mostly typecasted and relegated to bit parts.

2341
04:40:48,770 --> 04:40:58,000
By the time Plan 9 was filmed, he was destitute and addicted to morphine. Holy shit. He died

2342
04:40:58,000 --> 04:41:07,680
halfway through production. By the way, this was fun. Wait, what? He died halfway through production.

2343
04:41:07,680 --> 04:41:20,319
That's fucking horrible. Uh, also, I might suggest Freaks. 1932. That's sad and terrible.

2344
04:41:20,319 --> 04:41:26,880
That was the guy that used the cape? Oh, I fucking made fun of, that was, oh, I feel bad.

2345
04:41:26,880 --> 04:41:41,180
That's why they covered his face. Uh, thanks for the 250, Vrimthral. The Bella with the cape

2346
04:41:41,180 --> 04:41:46,930
up against his face is actually a double. Uh, Bella Lisosy died partway through into

2347
04:41:46,930 --> 04:41:52,880
filming Plan 9. Plan 9 was also Lisosy's final film. On a lighter note,

2348
04:41:52,880 --> 04:41:57,889
this whole stream has been golden. Thanks for the laughs. I'm glad we can come together and

2349
04:41:57,889 --> 04:42:03,299
have some fun. I had a few drinks. It's all, it's all good. You know, whatever. I played

2350
04:42:03,299 --> 04:42:09,409
Jump King to lead in my save. Embarrassing. What an embarrassing asshole. Uh, Fancy Boots. Thanks for

2351
04:42:09,409 --> 04:42:20,720
250. Correction. Plan 9 was technically, technically, Lisosy's final film. It was

2352
04:42:20,720 --> 04:42:28,819
released in 1959, but his appearance is comprised of old footage recorded before his passing.

2353
04:42:28,819 --> 04:42:45,709
Interesting tip. You're a movie nerd. Uh, Blaine. Blaine's Magmar. Thanks for 250. Uh,

2354
04:42:45,709 --> 04:42:49,310
Jerma, as a public health major, I want to say that you were doing a great service

2355
04:42:49,310 --> 04:42:55,569
just by making the quarantine more fun. You'll always be my favorite streamer. He has no idea

2356
04:42:55,569 --> 04:43:01,869
what the fuck he's saying. What? Yes, I do. I'm not like that far gone. Jesus. Give me some slack.

2357
04:43:01,869 --> 04:43:07,540
I've had some drinks. That doesn't mean I'm like fucking stupid. Oh, he's gone. He's,

2358
04:43:07,540 --> 04:43:16,369
he didn't have any idea what he's saying. Where is he? He's five. He's a five-year-old.

2359
04:43:16,369 --> 04:43:24,290
Give me some slack for Christ's sake. It's been like five hours of drinking. Eh, whatever. Hey,

2360
04:43:24,290 --> 04:43:32,900
DarkPyLord. Thanks for the five dollars. Jerma, fun fact about Plan 9 from Outer Space. Every

2361
04:43:32,900 --> 04:43:39,919
shot featuring Bella Lugosi was actually unused footage from a different movie Ed Wood had shot

2362
04:43:39,919 --> 04:44:15,220
years earlier. That's sad. So much Lugosi lore. I know. I'm laughing at that. No, I'm not. I'm

2363
04:44:15,220 --> 04:44:28,700
not laughing at some person. Hmm. Devakity, thanks for 250. In case you didn't know,

2364
04:44:28,700 --> 04:44:36,220
the backstory of Plan 9. Bella Lugosi that played the vampire was dead years before the movie.

2365
04:44:36,220 --> 04:45:00,540
I know the guy's dead. Okay. I get it. I know. He covered his face because after the actor wasn't

2366
04:45:00,540 --> 04:45:12,290
Lugosi, the footage where you see his face is leftover footage. I'm not laughing at that. I'm

2367
04:45:12,290 --> 04:45:19,650
laughing at chat being fucking hilarious. Ah, yeah. Bella Lugosi's dead. I know. I, this is like six

2368
04:45:19,650 --> 04:45:35,819
messages in a row. I know he's dead. I know. And then he was replaced. Please do The Great

2369
04:45:35,819 --> 04:45:48,349
Dictator. Pretty sure it's public domain. It's great. Thank you, Devakity. Oh, okay. I got to

2370
04:45:48,349 --> 04:45:53,150
fucking get it together. Hole of one zombie. Thanks for 250. This was amazing. Recommend.

2371
04:45:57,569 --> 04:46:04,369
I recommend any early Jackie Chan film in public domain or Ninja Dragon if it's on YouTube.

2372
04:46:04,450 --> 04:46:09,580
Not sure if it's public domain. Terribly dubbed Jackie Chan films are brilliant.

2373
04:46:09,580 --> 04:46:23,459
I don't think they're public domain. Appreciate it though. Thank you. Femme Enting Dregs. This was

2374
04:46:23,459 --> 04:46:32,020
$25. Femme Enting Dregs. Thanks. Thank you for a better movie night than I've seen in the past

2375
04:46:32,020 --> 04:46:40,080
five years in the old facilities known as theaters. Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was

2376
04:46:40,080 --> 04:46:46,659
going to in about a year from now the way things were going. If you're keeping going in these times

2377
04:46:47,220 --> 04:46:55,500
have a blast. I'm having a blast so far. $25 for a movie ticket. Yeah. Did I read that wrong?

2378
04:46:55,500 --> 04:47:00,430
Probably. Thank you for a better movie night than I've seen in the past five years in the old

2379
04:47:00,430 --> 04:47:06,529
facilities known as theaters. Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was going to in about a

2380
04:47:06,529 --> 04:47:13,250
year from now the way things were going. Hope you keep these things going. It's been a blast so far.

2381
04:47:13,250 --> 04:47:33,869
I did it right. I read that word for word. That's correct. Hey, Evangelion. The room is spinning.

2382
04:47:33,869 --> 04:47:42,299
No, it's not. Not even close. Hey, guess what? Plan 9 was actually the last film of Bela Lugosi.

2383
04:47:42,299 --> 04:47:47,869
The reason his face is hidden throughout most of the film either by his cape or by filming

2384
04:47:47,869 --> 04:47:52,189
is because it's actually a stand-in. The shots that actually show his face were filmed for

2385
04:47:52,189 --> 04:48:12,990
unrelated projects and then repurposed for this film. I'm not reading the same bits.

2386
04:48:17,470 --> 04:48:30,340
The show, you know, after his death in the order to draw in more of an audience,

2387
04:48:30,340 --> 04:48:43,459
they said it was Bela Lugosi's final film. Lugosi likely never met any of the actors in Plan 9.

2388
04:48:43,459 --> 04:48:53,360
Any more fun facts? That's so funny. The final actor, Lich, gave $50 fucking dollars and I missed

2389
04:48:53,360 --> 04:48:58,220
it, but they said these fucking aliens have space travel and guns that control dead bodies,

2390
04:48:58,220 --> 04:49:14,020
but humans have gone too far. Oh my God. Thanks for the huge amount of money.

2391
04:49:14,020 --> 04:49:25,360
Hey, Flimflam. $5. I got a burp. I can't mute it. Why? Why can't I mute this? What the fuck?

2392
04:49:26,740 --> 04:49:32,099
I tried. What the fuck? Stream Deck. What the fuck? Stream Deck, what are you doing? Mute this.

2393
04:49:37,259 --> 04:49:48,560
It won't mute. I don't know why. It sucks. Flimflam, thanks for the $5. Thanks for the stream.

2394
04:49:48,560 --> 04:49:53,950
I'd like to recommend The Pink Panther Strikes again for public domain movie night 2,

2395
04:49:53,950 --> 04:49:59,860
whenever that may be. Fairly certain it's public domain. If not, then please watch yourself.

2396
04:49:59,860 --> 04:50:06,849
If you haven't already, here's the link. Watch yourself? I think we've done that before.

2397
04:50:06,849 --> 04:50:19,549
Hey, Jerma, do you know that Bela Lugosi is dead? Stop. That's so easy to make me laugh right now.

2398
04:50:19,549 --> 04:50:27,889
Flimflam, another $5. Forgot you turned links off. Just search Uncle Carl, Uncle Earl's

2399
04:50:28,450 --> 04:50:36,659
classic TV channel, Pink Panther Strikes again. It's the first link. Uncle Carl's

2400
04:50:36,659 --> 04:50:56,930
Pink Panther. What the fuck is happening? I got it. Is this public domain though? I don't think

2401
04:50:56,930 --> 04:51:07,229
it is. Gotta be careful. Link is watching. Thanks for the $5. Sticks Renegade, thanks for $2.50.

2402
04:51:07,229 --> 04:51:17,169
Press J or L to FF or rewind 10 seconds, please. Plus press left or right on the arrow keys to do

2403
04:51:17,169 --> 04:51:23,389
5 seconds. I figured it out. Grizzly Wright, thanks for the $3. I'm making my first ever

2404
04:51:23,389 --> 04:51:32,930
Twitch donation to say that Santa is fucking stupid. Friedl Schlitz, thanks for $2.50.

2405
04:51:32,930 --> 04:51:37,540
Please make this a reoccurring thing. The stream has made me laugh out loud more than anything else

2406
04:51:37,540 --> 04:51:43,540
this month. Movies are more fun when you watch them with 7,000 other people. Also, you should

2407
04:51:43,540 --> 04:51:55,709
add Frog to the list. And its sequel, Frogs. They're both on YouTube. Oh, what's that? Another

2408
04:51:55,790 --> 04:52:05,310
$5,050 donation that I skipped and didn't even read? From Scripts 3?

2409
04:52:05,310 --> 04:52:12,189
Gerald, please. Just put on a Charlie Chaplin movie already. They're all public domain. Put on

2410
04:52:12,189 --> 04:52:24,220
the Gold Rush. That's the best one from him. Next time. Next time. Wolf Bowl, thanks for $5.

2411
04:52:26,770 --> 04:52:31,169
Did we really think that the ADHD streamer wasn't going to skip scenes and play fart and scream

2412
04:52:31,169 --> 04:52:38,909
sound effects? I don't know. I sent the message too early. I meant to say that I wouldn't have

2413
04:52:38,909 --> 04:52:44,340
had it any other way. Thank you for taking my fart sound effect suggestion. God damn it.

2414
04:52:44,340 --> 04:52:52,959
Abomination Zero, $15. Lots of fucking money. You have to do some Three Stooges shit for

2415
04:52:52,959 --> 04:53:11,740
Green Screen 2. I promise. But what about Bela Lugosi? Is he dead? Autumn Dragons, thanks for

2416
04:53:11,740 --> 04:53:17,580
the $2.50. Jerma, tonight was really fun. I'm really looking forward to future movie nights.

2417
04:53:17,580 --> 04:53:23,340
Call me a boomer, but it's fun to see what comedy was like back in the day. Also, in the future,

2418
04:53:23,340 --> 04:53:30,340
if it's possible, can you put on subtitles? It would help a bunch of us out. That's a rag on

2419
04:53:30,340 --> 04:53:37,220
your commentary or anything. Much love to everyone here. Congrats on getting to the top $500 on Twitch

2420
04:53:37,220 --> 04:53:44,659
as a Christian gamer dad streamer. Thanks. Hey, Snoozencopter, $2.50. Thanks for $2.50.

2421
04:53:46,860 --> 04:53:51,680
Today, after watching all these old movies and you making for the Fortnite YouTuber comment thing,

2422
04:53:51,759 --> 04:53:57,310
comedy really hasn't progressed at all. Every single YouTube and streamer comedy routine

2423
04:53:57,310 --> 04:54:07,419
consists out of making loud, funny, random noises and getting hurt in game. That will exist for the

2424
04:54:07,419 --> 04:54:16,130
next thousand years. Sorry to say. A Lars Blood Axe, thanks for $5. Charlie Chaplin made a movie

2425
04:54:16,130 --> 04:54:26,259
called Gold Rush in which he consumes a shoe. It's fate must be watched. Jerma put Sun Chips in F

2426
04:54:26,259 --> 04:54:34,779
tier, thanks to $2.50. More stream days, less stream hours. Kappa, to ban that person for

2427
04:54:34,779 --> 04:54:42,639
fucking 10 years. LM Man, thanks for the $5. Jerma, I wish you were quiet during the gorilla movie.

2428
04:54:42,639 --> 04:54:52,419
I really enjoyed it. I was fucking, I didn't, I shut the fuck up. Dr. Zoot Suit, $5. I can't believe

2429
04:54:52,419 --> 04:54:59,389
you actually played Jump King. I was kidding. Why did you read that? I'm so sorry. The fucking

2430
04:54:59,389 --> 04:55:07,810
stream is over anyways. Who cares? J Ran Cree, thanks for $15. So there's going to be another

2431
04:55:07,810 --> 04:55:12,830
Jump King stream where you beat it all over again, right? Hope so. The first time around was the

2432
04:55:12,830 --> 04:55:22,860
best. Either way, movie night was great. Let's do it again. I agree. Did I actually delete the whole

2433
04:55:22,860 --> 04:55:37,619
fucking thing? So bad. Why would you put that on the menu? Anything Show Official, thanks for $5.

2434
04:55:38,930 --> 04:55:44,290
You should do a Red Baron night tomorrow night where you play the old Red Baron games while

2435
04:55:44,290 --> 04:55:55,970
eating Red Baron pizza. I don't think so. Kirranj, thanks for $5. I missed about half the stream,

2436
04:55:55,970 --> 04:56:01,299
so I'm really excited to watch the VOD, but you have no idea how happy this movie stream idea

2437
04:56:01,299 --> 04:56:09,040
makes me. Older movies, mostly sci-fi and horror, also the B movie variety, are a big interest of

2438
04:56:09,040 --> 04:56:16,500
mine. So I'm really happy to watch some with everyone. The issue with these bad movies,

2439
04:56:16,500 --> 04:56:22,500
if they're really hit or miss, and a lot of slow with gold nuggets in them periodically.

2440
04:56:22,500 --> 04:56:28,500
Regardless, it was fun as hell. I think we hit fucking gold the first four hours at the three or

2441
04:56:28,500 --> 04:56:38,939
four hours. Those first two movies were perfect. And then I drank too much. And the third movie was

2442
04:56:38,939 --> 04:56:50,659
terrible. Pretty much it. LM, man, thanks for the 250. If you're going to play Sam and Max season

2443
04:56:50,659 --> 04:56:55,340
three, I won't. Have you ever considered playing Strong Bad's cool games for attractive people?

2444
04:56:55,340 --> 04:57:01,380
It's made by Telltale. I will not. I'm not going to play Sam and Max season three. It didn't grab me.

2445
04:57:01,380 --> 04:57:11,040
It wasn't a fan. It's just the way it is. Hey, Chimtrees, thanks for $3. I can't wait to see the

2446
04:57:11,040 --> 04:57:18,500
giant leeches in Germany. They won't be there. It will be sucked cigar and a waffle. Thanks for $5.

2447
04:57:18,500 --> 04:57:29,169
Remember, why did you become so hideous? It's called going past 35 happens to everybody.

2448
04:57:29,169 --> 04:57:37,389
Sorry, it happened to me. You posted cringe, bro. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Wait, is it over? I

2449
04:57:37,389 --> 04:57:42,560
thought you were watching multiple movies. That's why I'm just now tuning in. Looks like I'm the

2450
04:57:42,560 --> 04:57:57,150
clown here. I pay hands. We watched three movies and one three stooges TV show. I don't know when

2451
04:57:57,150 --> 04:58:07,900
you got here, but you probably don't hear him in the third movie, dude. We watched. We we watched

2452
04:58:07,900 --> 04:58:17,680
three. The leech counts, even though we skipped 30 minutes. It counts blueberry juice. Thanks for 250.

2453
04:58:17,680 --> 04:58:23,459
Hey, pal. Hey, pal. I hate to do this to you, especially so I can tell you're having so much

2454
04:58:23,459 --> 04:58:29,939
fun, but I'm going to have to write you up for a SUI. That's right. Streaming under the influence.

2455
04:58:30,580 --> 04:58:35,939
I mean, we can all have fun here or there, but deleting your save. It's fine if chat does it,

2456
04:58:35,939 --> 04:58:41,540
but you're the designated driver of this stream, not us. No, the only way to pay this off is if you

2457
04:58:41,540 --> 04:58:46,340
raid rift tracks, you know, considering you basically ripped off, you ripped off their entire

2458
04:58:46,340 --> 04:59:02,319
career. Mike Nelson's fucking Mike Nelson's a huge influence on my life. You got it. Are they live?

2459
04:59:02,319 --> 04:59:07,360
But we have worried somebody else. I've read it rift tracks like last week. They're fucking

2460
04:59:07,360 --> 04:59:13,599
fantastic. They're great guys. Goobery. Thanks for the 250 again. No, that's a lie. It's the same

2461
04:59:13,599 --> 04:59:21,779
message. Dr. Clay. Thanks for $5. If you ever do this again, please green screen yourself in the

2462
04:59:21,779 --> 04:59:29,310
lower right as a silhouette. That would really be copying Mike Nelson and those MST 3K guys. So I

2463
04:59:29,310 --> 04:59:38,639
don't know if I want to do that. Hey, crunch $3 from crunch PS. If we're talking older movies,

2464
04:59:39,659 --> 04:59:43,659
uh, not sure if you're into the universal monsters, but in my opinion, the invisible man

2465
04:59:44,720 --> 04:59:51,380
from 1933 is the absolute best universal monster movie they put out. I wish it were public domain

2466
04:59:51,380 --> 04:59:58,459
because I think it would be a great fun watch with everyone. It's too bad. Regardless, uh,

2467
04:59:58,459 --> 05:00:02,220
it's not an obscure recommendation, but I'd still recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.

2468
05:00:02,220 --> 05:00:09,740
It's one of my favorite movies in general, actually. Thanks again. I wish it was in public

2469
05:00:09,740 --> 05:00:24,349
domain. We'd watch it right now. God damn it. Hey hatchet. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the very

2470
05:00:24,349 --> 05:00:31,299
fun night. Hope we get to watch some Charlie Chaplin next time. Probably. We watched three

2471
05:00:31,299 --> 05:00:37,259
stooges this time. Why not next time? West you'll thousand bits, $10 German. I'm watching this in

2472
05:00:37,259 --> 05:00:43,380
VR with my best friends. Why would you watch this in VR? We're all major fans. PS, did you get your

2473
05:00:43,380 --> 05:00:54,419
haircut? Doesn't look like Lego hair. No, I smeared it back on the back of my head. It's just greasy

2474
05:00:54,419 --> 05:01:01,439
and smeared back. Don't be fooled. Hey Keith King Crimson. Thanks for $2.50. Hey German. Fun fact.

2475
05:01:01,439 --> 05:01:09,389
Bella Lugosi is alive and well and he's in my house right now. Okay. Um, I hope you guys have fun.

2476
05:01:09,389 --> 05:01:15,069
Hey Joe mount. Thanks for $5. German. Are you excited to be 80 plus years old and streaming

2477
05:01:15,069 --> 05:01:20,450
shitty video games? That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I can guarantee you.

2478
05:01:20,450 --> 05:01:29,229
Hey stream beyond. Thanks for $3. What do you do with bits in this? I'm not going to fucking be

2479
05:01:29,229 --> 05:01:36,130
live at 80. I got my golden years guys. Give me a break. What do you do with bits in this stream?

2480
05:01:36,130 --> 05:01:40,369
Is it some kind of currency thing? Thanks for the fun stream today and all the laughs you've

2481
05:01:40,369 --> 05:01:45,599
brought. Just so you know, the people who made who killed captain Alex made another movie.

2482
05:01:46,979 --> 05:01:56,270
That's also free. I've seen that one too. I've seen the sequel. Unfortunately, we can't watch

2483
05:01:56,270 --> 05:02:06,349
it here. I've seen it. Uh, cast lion. Thanks for $3. German on the topic of Bella Lugosi. I,

2484
05:02:06,349 --> 05:02:11,779
can we stop talking about this guy? You should watch Bella Lugosi meets a Brooklyn gorilla.

2485
05:02:13,060 --> 05:02:19,759
No, no, we're not, we're not talking about him anymore. Uh, I own you. I own you. You. Thanks

2486
05:02:19,759 --> 05:02:31,250
for $3. German actor died movie. Hey, he X in X. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the free bucks. I

2487
05:02:31,250 --> 05:02:43,939
still can't believe you deleted. By the way, I can't believe you. Uh, the whole stream has been

2488
05:02:43,939 --> 05:02:50,779
a blast. By the way, Bella Lugosi died. Laugh about it. I can't. Tana King. Thanks for the $15.

2489
05:02:51,979 --> 05:03:01,020
Why didn't they need the language computer when talking in person? I don't know. The movie's

2490
05:03:01,020 --> 05:03:09,299
terrible. Hey, Sculptor. Thanks for $5. German. You should watch the movie Ed Wood by Tim Burton.

2491
05:03:09,939 --> 05:03:15,860
It's a great comedy biopic about Ed Wood's life. In it, you learn that Bella Lugosi actually died

2492
05:03:15,860 --> 05:03:22,419
before the movie was completed and they, Bella Lugosi is dead. Yes. Hey, you posted cringe, bro.

2493
05:03:22,419 --> 05:03:27,779
Thanks for the thousand bits. Uh, I recommended Little Shop of Horrors for the next one. Although

2494
05:03:27,779 --> 05:03:33,860
Vinny might've already watched it on stream. Also F in the chat for Bella Lugosi. Yeah, let's see

2495
05:03:33,860 --> 05:03:42,610
him. The guy died like 40 years ago. F in the chat for him, I guess. I don't know. Uh, Medi Miren.

2496
05:03:43,250 --> 05:03:49,040
Thanks for the $5. German. It's test time. I hope you've been studying question one.

2497
05:03:49,970 --> 05:03:56,099
What happened to Bella Lugosi during plan nine? He died and they filmed it anyways and he's dead.

2498
05:03:56,099 --> 05:04:05,250
Thanks for the $5. Uh, Shibururu. Thanks for $3. Chat clearly loves Lugosi. Cheers to him.

2499
05:04:05,250 --> 05:04:11,470
I'm sure he'd germ a heart for all the love. Also all the people freaking out about freaks.

2500
05:04:11,470 --> 05:04:21,250
That movie's too smart for their little minds, I guess. I didn't say it. He did. Hey, Flimflam.

2501
05:04:21,250 --> 05:04:28,349
Thanks for the $5. That website that has the Pink Panther movie states that their public domain.

2502
05:04:28,430 --> 05:04:38,270
Gotta get that confirmed before I do that. I would do it. Neuro Gasly. 500 bits from Neuro Gasly. Hey

2503
05:04:38,270 --> 05:04:42,430
man, in case you didn't know, Bella Lugosi isn't actually dead. He was pretending I was there. I

2504
05:04:42,430 --> 05:04:48,900
was also the gorilla. That's good to know. Thanks for the fucking $5. Uh, Myriad. Thanks for $15.

2505
05:04:48,900 --> 05:04:55,619
No message. Just a huge amount of money. Thanks for 15 bucks. Uh, Glumrot. Thanks for $3. German.

2506
05:04:55,619 --> 05:05:01,729
I just came from my friend's goth DJ set and he can't get it to work. Can you help him come

2507
05:05:01,729 --> 05:05:09,419
to unplug it and plug it back in? If not, then tell him to, uh, just sell it all. Hey, uh, Vibio

2508
05:05:09,419 --> 05:05:14,220
game. Thanks for $5. Movie night was an absolute blast. Thanks for so much. Fantastic streams.

2509
05:05:14,220 --> 05:05:21,220
I'm semi delirious from laughing. Looking forward to the next time you do this.

2510
05:05:21,220 --> 05:05:28,270
Me too. It'll be fun. Uh, thank you. Bella Lugosi's ghost for the $5. Wow. Must've made

2511
05:05:28,270 --> 05:05:34,029
that name five seconds ago. Hey, German. I heard you enjoyed my final movie. Hope you can watch

2512
05:05:34,029 --> 05:05:38,430
more of them in the future. Cool. Thanks for the $5. Bella Lugosi's ghost guy that made this

2513
05:05:38,430 --> 05:05:44,990
fucking username 10 minutes ago. Uh, Spooge. Thanks for $3. Hey, I've been lurking recently

2514
05:05:44,990 --> 05:05:49,819
and haven't been super active in chat, but I'm glad to have these streams to keep us all company

2515
05:05:49,819 --> 05:05:56,380
during these lockdown hours. Loving it every day. By the way, when's the next FTK stream?

2516
05:05:56,380 --> 05:06:03,860
Are you going to play Resident Evil 3? Uh, FTK is currently being developed. It's going to be fun.

2517
05:06:03,860 --> 05:06:09,729
This is going to be events. It will return. I promise. I just don't have a date.

2518
05:06:09,729 --> 05:06:18,849
Resident Evil 3. Uh, streamer is going to lie to you. Streamer is lying to you. Hey, Evangelion.

2519
05:06:18,849 --> 05:06:26,299
Thanks for the $2.50. Did you know Dick Rubin is dead? He did props for 99 movies in his life,

2520
05:06:26,299 --> 05:06:35,060
including Sex Kittens Go to College. That's not porn, by the way. Weird title for a not porn movie.

2521
05:06:35,060 --> 05:06:40,639
He was responsible for those terrible garbage leeches. IMTV is amazing. Anyway, he's dead.

2522
05:06:40,639 --> 05:06:48,939
Isn't that interesting? Oh, and he worked on some Star Trek, I guess. I guess. Thanks for the $2.50.

2523
05:06:48,939 --> 05:06:56,189
Uh, thanks Sturdy Bread for the $2.50. Dr. Clay's suggestion was created in sub chat.

2524
05:06:56,189 --> 05:07:10,990
There is an MST 3K silhouette of Yu, Shito, and Beanbag Sonic. Jesus Christ. He's in hell.

2525
05:07:15,380 --> 05:07:21,389
Don't say that! Worm Club, thanks for $2.50. Hey, Jerma, I love Moominite. You should, yeah.

2526
05:07:22,459 --> 05:07:32,700
You and chat seem to like comedies the most. Please consider Buster Keaton's Shurran Jr.

2527
05:07:32,700 --> 05:07:37,259
It actually entered public domain this year and is full of Keaton's insane stunts,

2528
05:07:37,259 --> 05:07:46,049
one of which almost killed him. Okay. Oh, by the way, Bella Lugosi is dead. I didn't know.

2529
05:07:46,049 --> 05:07:50,860
Thanks for asking. Cigar and a waffle, thanks for $5. I can't stop watching your streams,

2530
05:07:50,860 --> 05:08:01,040
but I really don't like you. What the fuck are you doing here? Go watch Fucking Breaking Bad.

2531
05:08:01,040 --> 05:08:07,569
I don't get out of here. What are you doing here? Jerma put sun chips in F tier and I would again.

2532
05:08:08,290 --> 05:08:13,819
Just so you know, thanks for $2.50. I was able to successfully free Bella Lugosi from King Crimson's

2533
05:08:13,819 --> 05:08:20,060
home. Please call the cops. I can hear his footsteps behind me and that person. Uh, Alomar

2534
05:08:20,060 --> 05:08:24,060
waffle. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the tons of laughs. As always, please look into how public

2535
05:08:24,060 --> 05:08:36,479
domain works before you get banned. It's fucking, it's not illegal. What are you talking about?

2536
05:08:36,479 --> 05:08:42,689
Hey, you posted cringe, bro. Thanks for five more dollars. Uh, Lella Bogosi was born before

2537
05:08:42,689 --> 05:08:49,310
the movie was completed. Funny fucking comment. Hey Johnny, nice mountains. Thanks for $5. Why

2538
05:08:49,310 --> 05:08:54,110
are you making a mockery of Bella Lugosi's recent passing? He died like 40 years ago. Thanks for the

2539
05:08:54,110 --> 05:09:00,450
$5. Uh, Cthulhu Katamari. Thanks for the $3. Hey Jerma, love the stream. Fun fact, Bella Lugosi

2540
05:09:00,450 --> 05:09:05,490
never actually existed. He was just a green screen. Thanks for the three bucks. Uh, Fritz in the house.

2541
05:09:05,490 --> 05:09:10,290
Thanks for $6. 66 fucking Satan money. I love the stream. Felt like we were all a part of an episode

2542
05:09:10,369 --> 05:09:15,970
of best of the worst. I really like to see more of the mystery films. I love seeing the chat lose

2543
05:09:15,970 --> 05:09:25,979
their minds as it played out. Me too. Hey, to address the subs, please. We had some subs here.

2544
05:09:25,979 --> 05:09:45,580
We had a lot of subs to dress them. He's drunk. I mean, did you need a fucking scientist to tell

2545
05:09:45,580 --> 05:09:51,979
you that one? I could have told you that 10 minutes ago. What are you talking about? Uh,

2546
05:09:51,979 --> 05:09:58,380
thanks for the subs, everybody. Appreciate all the continued support. You guys fucking spoil the shit

2547
05:09:58,380 --> 05:10:08,610
out of me. Here they come. Thank you. Hope you enjoyed movie night one. Movie night two will

2548
05:10:09,779 --> 05:10:17,500
definitely happen. Just not now. That was a ton of fun. I even, I had some drinks. It was a blast.

2549
05:10:17,500 --> 05:10:21,020
I would fucking do it all over again. A million times. Thanks for staying around. Thanks for

2550
05:10:21,020 --> 05:10:34,450
hanging out. We do have a few more hits to do. Uh, Johnny nice mountains. Thanks for $5. Why are

2551
05:10:34,450 --> 05:10:39,889
you making a mockery out of Bela Lugosi's recent passing? I'm not. Uh, I didn't even know he died

2552
05:10:39,889 --> 05:10:48,299
30 years ago. Thanks for $5. Uh, I already read that one by the way. Hey, Skizzoy. Thanks for $5.

2553
05:10:50,029 --> 05:10:56,770
You should check out the goth band Bajas. Their most popular song is called Bela Lugosi's Dead.

2554
05:10:57,490 --> 05:11:04,369
I think you'd like it. Great. Maybe. Hey, Goo Berry Juice. Thanks for $4.50. Sir, this theater

2555
05:11:04,369 --> 05:11:07,810
doesn't tolerate noise pollution and drinking, so I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.

2556
05:11:08,610 --> 05:11:17,779
However, I can't believe I deleted the fucking save. We are obligated to give you a movie

2557
05:11:17,779 --> 05:11:23,220
fun fact before we evict you from the premises. Bela Lugosi didn't delete his Jump King save file

2558
05:11:23,860 --> 05:11:29,630
on stream. Now please take your monthly bath. I'm, yeah, I can't fucking believe I did that.

2559
05:11:29,630 --> 05:11:36,799
That's so stupid. I spent like so many hours on that. Hey, Jay Bum Bum. Thanks for the three

2560
05:11:36,799 --> 05:11:44,909
fucking Jesus. Germa, I said you were a greasy teen. Not that you had greasy teeth.

2561
05:11:45,470 --> 05:11:51,860
I apologize. Your teeth are pristine and perfect. Just like you, babe. This stream was amazing and

2562
05:11:51,860 --> 05:11:57,680
I'm excited for the next one. The next movie night I recommend Neil Breen. His movies are all

2563
05:11:57,680 --> 05:12:11,310
on YouTube. Sage the Ghost. Thanks for $5. Please will you cut your own hair on stream?

2564
05:12:16,880 --> 05:12:28,819
It, they say do it for Lugosi. I don't fucking know who that guy was. I don't, I didn't know him.

2565
05:12:29,759 --> 05:12:35,540
Thanks for the five bucks. Hey, $3 from, uh, Peridotty. Thanks for the three bucks. Germa,

2566
05:12:35,540 --> 05:12:44,130
me and my boyfriend and watch your streams and vlogs. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out

2567
05:12:44,130 --> 05:12:52,380
of here. I'm out of here. Uh, I just want to say thanks for the laughs. We love you. Also,

2568
05:12:52,380 --> 05:13:03,229
can you say hi Chris? Yes. Hi Chris. I'm not going to cut my hair on stream. Oh,

2569
05:13:03,310 --> 05:13:15,119
this is fucking funny. Uh, Hey Chris, I'm glad you to watch the streams and one more. No, seriously.

2570
05:13:15,119 --> 05:13:20,580
Thank you for watching. Anybody that watches, I fucking thanks a lot. Agent Dark booty. Thanks

2571
05:13:20,580 --> 05:13:24,819
for the $5. Streaming goes to theater, gets drunk and rants about Bell Lugosi's death.

2572
05:13:25,380 --> 05:13:32,740
I didn't, you did and I read it. Hey, steer, steal, a steal. Thanks for $5. Jeremy,

2573
05:13:33,380 --> 05:13:37,619
I've watched you for so long without donating. You are pretty cool for a guy named Jeremy. What's

2574
05:13:37,619 --> 05:13:48,529
the fucking, what's that supposed to mean? Steel. What do you mean? You know, are the Jeremy's that

2575
05:13:48,529 --> 05:13:56,159
suck. I'm a cool art. I'll see you guys on Monday. Thanks for watching. I had so much fun. I hope you

2576
05:13:56,159 --> 05:14:09,700
did too. We're going to raid. It's a, it's a, it's a Friday night. Who are we rating? Not rift tracks.

2577
05:14:10,500 --> 05:14:14,189
Give me some names. Give me some names. Name, name, name, name, name, name, name.

2578
05:14:16,659 --> 05:14:26,000
That's a bad, that was the front page of Twitch talent. Criken, Criken, Bernie Sanders, critical,

2579
05:14:27,869 --> 05:14:43,970
Vinny. Who have we never rated before? I want someone we'd never rated. Never. Who's Greg? I

2580
05:14:43,970 --> 05:14:54,750
don't know what the fuck Greg is. What are you talking about? I do a guy with, no, not Bernie's

2581
05:14:54,750 --> 05:15:04,020
not live. What are you talking about? I've rated Nova a bunch of times. Nova's awesome. We've rated

2582
05:15:04,020 --> 05:15:24,380
critical. Who have we not rated before? Let's say, let's say who's playing games. Who's playing

2583
05:15:24,459 --> 05:15:29,020
Nintendo games? I'm a Nintendo streamer guys. Who's playing Nintendo games right now?

2584
05:15:41,569 --> 05:15:58,110
See, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's playing fucking Mario? I want to, I want a Mario streamer

2585
05:15:58,110 --> 05:16:07,520
and that's it. Mario. Who's playing Mario? Mario. Why? Because Sue, I want to, I want to

2586
05:16:07,520 --> 05:16:14,319
rate a Super Mario fucking. Somebody's playing Super Mario. Bela Lugosi is dead. I can't rate

2587
05:16:14,319 --> 05:16:35,939
him. I can't fucking, can't believe I'm saying this. Okay. We've got, let's take a look down.

2588
05:16:35,939 --> 05:16:48,659
Discover list. Nope. Categories. Okay. Minecraft. Nope. Animal Crossing. No, thanks.

2589
05:16:49,459 --> 05:16:55,840
Mario Maker 2. No, thanks. I mean, the game's good. Mario Kart 8.

2590
05:17:06,270 --> 05:17:28,610
Mario Tennis. Top decision. Mario Tennis. Mario 64. Lugosi streaming Mario right now. Jesus Christ.

2591
05:17:29,090 --> 05:17:52,740
Imagine. Mario Galaxy 2. Who's playing Mario Galaxy 2? 24 hour stream. Mizkif is playing Mario.

2592
05:17:52,740 --> 05:18:04,029
All right. Here we go. You ready? We're going to raid Mizkif. Let's go. Let's go for it. Let's go.

2593
05:18:08,349 --> 05:18:18,880
What do you mean no? What? What are you vetoing? What? I'm getting vetoed. What the fuck is going

2594
05:18:18,880 --> 05:18:46,000
on? What? Cancel. What the fuck? Don't do it. I've already done it. What? I'm missing bits.

2595
05:18:46,000 --> 05:18:58,180
Where are their bits? Oh, shit, I did. He's playing Mario Galaxy 2. What's the fucking problem? What?

2596
05:18:58,740 --> 05:19:16,799
He's currently arguing with people on stream. I feel like I do that too.

2597
05:19:25,380 --> 05:19:42,080
What's going on? Read my bits. All right. Holy shit. Skulper. Thanks for $5.

2598
05:19:42,880 --> 05:19:47,540
Remember to answer your question to me and my friends. We're watching in VR

2599
05:19:47,540 --> 05:19:51,459
so we can hang out while we do it. Also love the stream. Lugosi for Rumble.

2600
05:19:52,180 --> 05:19:56,340
I don't even know what he looks like. Johnny. Nice mountains. Thanks for $5.

05:19:57,220 --> 05:20:02,619
I saw a picture of you and Bella Lugosi at Comic-Con. You both shaking hands while you stare

2602
05:20:02,619 --> 05:20:15,840
creepily into the camera. I don't fucking even know who that is. All right. Go fucking dumped.

2603
05:20:15,840 --> 05:20:27,419
Just go tell italics to fuck himself. Let's go. Why is everybody losing their fucking minds over

2604
05:20:27,419 --> 05:20:52,299
this? Getting vetoed by the chat. What the fuck? Look at Mario streamers. No, don't do that. He

2605
05:20:52,299 --> 05:21:07,840
kills people. What? No, don't actually say go fuck yourself. Just be nice. Do you read chat? I just

2606
05:21:07,840 --> 05:21:13,060
read it. All right. I'll see you guys on Monday. Take care. It was a lot of fun. I had a blast.

2607
05:21:13,060 --> 05:21:20,259
Thanks for watching, as always. It was a ton of fun. Thanks for participating. Go tell italics

2608
05:21:20,259 --> 05:21:29,580
that he's a fucking swell guy. Wait, he's ending the stream? Oh, fuck. He's ending.

2609
05:21:29,580 --> 05:21:36,299
Cancel. Cancel. Don't go to italics. Cancel. Don't go to italics stream. We're going to go.

2610
05:21:38,639 --> 05:21:46,590
Oh, god damn it. He's ending his stream. What the fuck? All right. Hold on. Who else is streaming?

2611
05:21:48,419 --> 05:21:57,659
Go to uber hack zone over. He's a fucking good dude. Let's go. Fucking he's a good dude. Let's go.

2612
05:22:00,459 --> 05:22:06,060
He's ending his stream right now. Oh, god. All right. Nova's a good dude. He's funny. You'll

2613
05:22:06,060 --> 05:22:44,669
like him. He's doing GTRP. Good night. Goodbye. See you Monday. Same spot. Same exact spot.
