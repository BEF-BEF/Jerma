1
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:25,719
All right. Hello? What is this? I'm not muted?

2
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,219
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:37,990
I just turned the stream on. What do you mean I have 20 minutes before my solar system is destroyed?

4
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:46,560
Oh. It's like we just- I just turned the stream on. You have 20 minutes before the fucking solar system is destroyed, Jeremy.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,380
You're five minutes late. No audio? Oh, there we go.

6
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,880
I didn't even know there was a direct today. I had no idea.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
I don't even watch these.

8
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,959
Wait, did they spoil the game? I'm so disheveled right now. I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.

9
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,959
I was getting out- I was getting out of the shower, and somebody just goes,

10
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,459
Hey dude, you're missing the direct.

11
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,459
I was like, I don't- I don't care.

12
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,959
But then I was like, I kind of do.

13
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,959
I haven't even brushed my teeth yet. I got up like 10 minutes ago. Did not wake up 10 minutes ago. I'm kidding.

14
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,959
All right. Get me out of here.

15
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,079
What game is this?

16
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,319
Famicom Detective Club?

17
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:58,819
Isn't that the Nintendo?

18
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,319
That's the Nintendo- That's the Super Nintendo.

19
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,819
I got a tweet that I'm streaming.

20
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,319
I'll turn it up.

21
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,330
Put the cam back on. Hold on a second. I wasn't ready for this.

22
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,030
Why did I rush to turn this stream on and freak out at direct?

23
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,530
Hold on.

24
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,030
Did they already announce who the next Smash Brothers character is?

25
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,710
Did they announce who the next Smash Brothers character is?

26
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,509
They did? Who was it? Johnny Bravo?

27
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,009
I really hope it was Johnny Bravo.

28
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,009
It was a Xenoblade girl.

29
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,509
Oh.

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
A new age of ba- Hold on. I gotta tweet this.

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,939
I'm not even paying attention. I care more about like tweeting my stream out. I'm not even- What's- Hold on.

32
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:33,039
I'm like screen capping this window, by the way. I didn't even get the- I didn't even get the embed link.

33
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,039
It wasn't in my froggy sleepy voice. It sounds like I just got up five minutes ago.

34
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,539
I may have.

35
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,039
Alright, I gotta tweet out. I'm ready.

36
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,050
Samurai Warriors 5.

37
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,229
I have no idea what's going on.

38
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,229
I feel like I'm dreaming.

39
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,229
I'm dreaming.

40
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,730
I'm watching Turbo 985 stream right now. I'm dreaming.

41
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,730
Am I awake? This would make sense if I woke the fuck up right now.

42
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,730
And I woke up like-

43
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:32,730
Sweat just dripping down my face like I've got- I've rushed to get a stream on to stream a Nintendo Direct when I've only streamed like one Nintendo Direct in four years.

44
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,230
I don't think I've ever done this.

45
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,899
Have I ever done this?

46
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,529
I- This is what I'm saying!

47
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,529
First the world's gonna explode, then I'm gonna dream.

48
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:54,529
Shit, I gotta shut up.

49
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
I have a snowman.

50
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,240
That snowman was pretty cool.

51
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
What game is this?

52
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,819
What do you say?

53
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,819
That looks kinda cool. Somebody said egg yolk hair.

54
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,819
When you mean there's egg yolk in my hair.

55
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,319
There's egg yolk in my hair.

56
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:45,319
And you know what? Here's the proof that I didn't brush my teeth.

57
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,319
Because my tongue is probably still blue from the blue drink I had last night.

58
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:49,819
Yup.

59
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,420
Is it?

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,410
I mean the screen is blue.

61
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,639
Why'd you need to prove that?

62
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,610
You don't fucking believe me.

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,220
Wait, is this Monster Hunter?

64
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,120
Why did they not put the Monster Hunter world on the Switch?

65
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,350
Because they were making like a Switch version kind of, I guess?

66
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,600
It's too powerful.

67
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:40,939
It wouldn't run.

68
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:41,939
Well, this one does.

69
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,579
Why the fuck are you watching this?

70
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:27,089
I don't know.

71
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,720
I don't know.

72
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,220
I think somebody said, dude, the direct is on.

73
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm like, fucking, I gotta hurry the fuck up.

74
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I gotta hurry up.

75
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,180
I'm watching this.

76
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,850
Go back to bed? Fine.

77
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,750
This is cool though.

78
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
Actually, I wanted to...

79
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,750
Recently I wanted to download Monster Hunter World.

80
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,750
On Switch.

81
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,250
But it was like, oh, it's not on Switch.

82
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
But okay, this is Monster Hunter Rise.

83
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,250
Cool, alright, that's cool.

84
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
We got a release date now.

85
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,250
Did we have a release date already and I just didn't know?

86
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,250
And I'm just...

87
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,750
Is that like a big reveal or did we already know that?

88
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,910
That was the latest trailer for Monster Hunter Rise from Capcom.

89
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,910
But it's still cool though.

90
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,850
How will our heroes fare against these ferocious monsters?

91
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,350
Stay tuned for the latest installment in the Monster Hunter series.

92
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,350
Launching March 26th.

93
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,529
Can I play it?

94
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,029
Next.

95
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,029
Please take a look at this.

96
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,139
Mario Golf, I mean, this is a huge deal.

97
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,139
Mario Golf Super Rush.

98
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,139
Okay, that's...

99
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:57,139
I can't wait for this game.

100
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,000
I want a new Mario Baseball too.

101
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Is it multiplayer?

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It better be.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I hope there is.

104
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,399
Use features on the greens like a shot gauge to see how your shot will curve due to slopes.

105
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,399
Ooh, that's cool.

106
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,399
And a scan that lets you examine a course's terrain.

107
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
Online multiplayer?

108
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
Right, it has to be.

109
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
These features can help you ace your shots.

110
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,480
In addition to button controls, you can also use motion controls by holding a Joy-Con controller like a golf club.

111
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
That's kind of cool.

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Gently swing the controller to have your character swing in the game.

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Dude, Wii Golf, they brought it back.

114
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Enjoy the sensation of golfing.

115
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,159
You run around?

116
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,159
On top of all that, there are several modes with new elements that truly bring the heat to Mario Golf.

117
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,159
Wait, you're running around?

118
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,159
You have to fight each other?

119
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,169
Wait, what?

120
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,169
It's always your turn.

121
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:05,169
Everyone tees off at the same time, then you'll race through the course to reach your ball.

122
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,169
Wait, is this so unsafe?

123
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:09,169
Then keep going.

124
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,169
Luigi's gonna take a ball off the forehead when Mario's driving.

125
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:15,169
These skills aren't the only things at play.

126
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:19,169
Make use of dashes and special shots to beat the competition.

127
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,169
Oh, did we mention story mode?

128
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,169
There's a story mode.

129
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:31,169
You'll start out as a rookie and develop your golfing skills while interacting with various Mushroom Kingdom characters.

130
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,169
Okay, I hate this so much, but it might be my favorite game of the year.

131
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,169
Then allocate points to different stats.

132
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,169
You know what I mean?

133
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,169
This is amazing.

134
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,169
I hate that I love this so much.

135
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,169
You can also use your Mii in versus play.

136
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,169
You have skill points and shit in golf?

137
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:51,169
When Mario Golf Super Rush swings onto Nintendo Switch, June 25th.

138
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,169
I hate that sport.

139
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,169
Pre-orders begin on Nintendo eShop after this presentation.

140
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,169
I only care about golf when I play it as Super Mario, that's it.

141
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:00,169
But I care about it very deeply when I do.

142
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:09,169
The latest game in the Mario Golf series adds new gameplay for multiplayer modes, as well as the familiar golf gameplay with easy-to-learn controls.

143
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,169
This is really fun.

144
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,169
This is cool.

145
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,169
I like this.

146
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,919
You look forward to this game on Nintendo Switch.

147
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,919
Let's move on to more Nintendo Switch headlines.

148
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,919
Headlines.

149
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,740
Hey!

150
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Check out these games coming to Nintendo Switch.

151
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,490
That looks good.

152
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,490
Return to the unforgiving world of Pandora in Tales from the Borderlands.

153
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,490
Play as the Hyperion lackey, Reese, and the quick-witted con artist, Fiona, as you set out to recover a mountain of cash.

154
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,490
This is not a new game.

155
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:48,490
But you can play it in the bathroom.

156
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,490
That's really important.

157
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,490
You can play it in the bathroom.

158
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,490
Couldn't do that before.

159
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:03,490
Every single game that comes on the Switch that's been out for five years, they really should just be serious about it.

160
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,490
Be real about it.

161
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,490
And Tales from the Borderlands is coming out on the Switch bathroom edition.

162
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:22,490
Just call it bathroom edition because that's what everyone's going to do.

163
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,490
Skyrim bathroom edition.

164
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,490
Go back offline until the Direct is over.

165
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:41,669
In this action game from Aspire, you'll build your zombie horde and take revenge on the city by turning humans into your undead allies.

166
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,669
Replenish your bodily arsenal with sputum head.

167
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,669
This is an incredibly highly requested game, by the way.

168
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,669
This city ain't no match for a dead man.

169
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,669
Stub the zombie and rebel without a pulse.

170
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,669
Eat its way onto Nintendo Switch March 16.

171
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,669
Pre-orders begin today on Nintendo eShop.

172
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,669
This looks pretty good.

173
00:12:58,669 --> 00:12:59,669
All right.

174
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:00,909
Put that on the list.

175
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,909
That will be good.

176
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,909
Quiet.

177
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:06,909
Everybody quiet.

178
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,149
When is it coming out?

179
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,149
You'll have to do some odd jobs around town and earn enough to pay off the entry fee.

180
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,149
There's a mining one.

181
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,149
Against the slew of unusual opponents.

182
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,149
Most of them aliens with some crazy tricks up their sleeves.

183
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,149
Study their tactics carefully to gain the upper hand in combat.

184
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:55,149
With a new and improved death glove, you'll have access to a variety of deadly skills that can be customized and upgraded before each match.

185
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,450
The fate of the world is at stake.

186
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,450
Oh, man.

187
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,450
So be ready to kick some whatever aliens have that you can kick.

188
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,450
Well, it looks a little rough, though.

189
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,450
August, okay.

190
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,450
August.

191
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,450
It looks a little rough.

192
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,549
They all do.

193
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:16,549
Yeah, they do.

194
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:19,549
I'm going to play it.

195
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,549
I'm going to love it.

196
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,549
But that looked like really brain-brainy and kind of rough.

197
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,570
It's your PC.

198
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,600
Wait, is this a card game?

199
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
It's a shooter?

200
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:54,269
What?

201
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm absolutely not going to play this, but it looks like a great game to watch somebody play, play very well.

202
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,149
Looking forward to that.

203
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,679
Cool.

204
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,679
The DC Super Hero Girls are here to save the day.

205
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,679
Hi, everyone.

206
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,679
My name is Barbara Gordon.

207
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,240
DC Super Hero Girls Teen Power.

208
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,600
He's inventing new gadgets.

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,360
This is Super Girl.

210
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
She's super strong and has heat vision.

211
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Plus super breath.

212
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,370
Super breath.

213
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,370
And let's not forget Wonder Woman.

214
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,370
And, of course, Super Breath.

215
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,639
You don't want to be, you don't want your move to be classified as super breath.

216
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
Along with our friends Green Lantern, Bumblebee, and Zatanna, we fight evil supervillains to keep our city.

217
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,639
I feel like that's kind of rude.

218
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,639
But we're not justified.

219
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,639
Like, wow, you got super breath today.

220
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,639
Like, okay.

221
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,639
There'll be clean breath?

222
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,639
How about like minty breath?

223
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:23,990
She used her new super move.

224
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,990
Clean breath.

225
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,990
Hey, that sucked.

226
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,990
That's a shitty superpower.

227
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
You brushed your teeth this morning?

228
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Yeah, but it's a ton.

229
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
It's a huge air.

230
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Clean breath.

231
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
...figures out our secret identities.

232
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,549
DC Super Hero Girls.

233
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:46,549
Teen Power.

234
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,549
Heroically sourced onto Nintendo Switch.

235
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,549
June 4th.

236
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Ready the juice cannons and prepare for battle.

237
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Are we?

238
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:04,029
This is what Plants vs. Zombies.

239
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:13,180
Battle for Neighborville.

240
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
March 25th Switch.

241
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,220
Fleet Edition.

242
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,369
Is this just Plants vs. Warfare?

243
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

244
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,250
Yeah, it is.

245
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,230
Okay.

246
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,849
Everybody get up.

247
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:47,849
Everybody get up.

248
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:48,849
Everybody just stand up.

249
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,849
Put your hands up.

250
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Everybody just get up.

251
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Just get up.

252
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Get up already.

253
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Come on.

254
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Get up.

255
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,289
Get up.

256
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,289
No, sit down.

257
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,289
You're playing a video game.

258
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,289
It's Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

259
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,289
Sit the fuck down.

260
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,289
You're gonna get in the way of everybody else on the couch.

261
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:15,289
Don't stand up.

262
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:16,289
Sit down.

263
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,289
Stay seated.

264
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:25,289
It's Miitopia.

265
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Makeup.

266
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
I feel like I have to play this.

267
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
What do they do?

268
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Do they just live in like a house or something?

269
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
They live in like a town?

270
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Ooh.

271
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
This is cute.

272
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
This is cute.

273
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Oh, cool.

274
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,859
Miitopia.

275
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,099
Yeah, I turned on the facecam for the raid.

276
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,000
I saw it.

277
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I saw Kitboga just came in with a fucking monster raid.

278
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So I turned on the webcam.

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Thanks a lot.

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Welcome, guys.

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We're watching the Directive.

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We're gonna play Slime Rancher later.

283
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's Super Mario.

284
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Wait, what?

285
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So play some however and wherever you'd like.

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's awesome.

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Whoa.

288
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's Mario Maker Animal Crossing.

289
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,799
But thanks a lot, Kitboga.

290
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,799
Welcome, everybody.

291
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,799
Thank you.

292
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,799
That's a shitload of people.

293
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,799
Hope you had a good stream.

294
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,359
Have a good rest of your day, dude.

295
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,359
Hey, why not try recreating the Mushroom Kingdom?

296
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,609
The raid song?

297
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,609
A free update for the game launches February 25th.

298
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:38,490
After downloading it, Super Mario Bros. items will be available via Nook Shopping starting March 1st.

299
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,490
I was off camera, but I was going like this.

300
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,490
Trying to find a way to do it.

301
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,490
I was going like this.

302
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,059
I was getting ready.

303
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,059
I was getting ready to be like...

304
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,089
There you go.

305
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,089
This is your raid song.

306
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,089
Welcome.

307
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,089
Thanks for the raid.

308
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,089
Thanks.

309
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,089
Go follow Kitboga if you don't.

310
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,089
What are you, out of your mind?

311
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,519
A new launch for the Super Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury game.

312
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,519
We hope you enjoy that Mario adventure as well.

313
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,470
Next, we have another game to show you.

314
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,220
Another one.

315
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,740
What's this one?

316
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Zelda.

317
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
The Legend of Zelda.

318
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,039
Tipping the scales.

319
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,230
Legend of Zelda.

320
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:49,099
The weight of time.

321
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,099
What ideas will you expose?

322
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:55,000
What is that?

323
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The latest in the HD 2D series.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,359
He leaves us no recourse.

325
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,359
Oh.

326
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,359
S-Frost will answer for its crimes today.

327
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,359
Are these the wages of loyalty?

328
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,359
Raised earth and burnt corpses.

329
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,359
You and no other must decide how we proceed.

330
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,359
I would love like a Christmas, like Santa RPG.

331
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,359
It's like top down, like isometric Santa Claus.

332
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,359
You like play Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.

333
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:23,359
Like Rudolph and Frosty and shit.

334
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,359
What is that?

335
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,359
Why make that?

336
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,359
It'd be cool.

337
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,359
I promise to do all in my power to see us through this safely.

338
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,359
Every last one of us.

339
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,119
Triangle strategy?

340
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,680
Far, far away lies the continent of Norzilea.

341
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Comprised of three nations and limited deposits of salt and iron.

342
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,680
The constant feuds among the nations over these precious resources

343
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,680
eventually ignited into a great conflict known as the Salt-Iron War.

344
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Though the hostilities ceased with an uneasy truce,

345
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
decades later the flames of war threatened to engulf the realm once again.

346
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Can I ask a question?

347
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
What's with the burning embers that go across the screen on every trailer ever?

348
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Caught in a tangled fiery web of plots and conspiracies.

349
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,680
It's always like the edges are burning and embers are floating across the screen.

350
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
In like half of every trailer I've ever watched.

351
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
That would orchestrate their downfall.

352
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Our benefit you say.

353
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Just pay attention, you'll see.

354
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,960
In this new tactical RPG, battles take place on terrain

355
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
with different elevations.

356
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,960
A character's attack range is determined by their location and their equipment.

357
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,960
The range can be extended by attacking from higher ground

358
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,960
with long-range weapons such as bows and arrows.

359
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Thus, your forces can use the terrain and other elements

360
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
to gain the upper hand.

361
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,960
An enemy outflanked is susceptible not only to your angel attack,

362
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,960
but also a powerful blow from the ally positioned behind the enemy.

363
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
What have we here?

364
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,680
Charge into an enemy to see them flying into position for a follow-up attack.

365
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Link attacks together by first casting ice magic on the flames to create water terrain.

366
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Then, electrify the area with lightning magic.

367
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Power up!

368
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,680
It is of the utmost importance to survey the battlefield.

369
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:33,079
Electrify the battlefield with power up!

370
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:37,079
Throughout the story, you will be faced with making important decisions

371
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,509
in a variety of situations.

372
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,509
Utility, morality, liberty.

373
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,509
Collectively, your decisions will establish your conviction

374
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:55,509
affecting how the story unfolds and who will join your cause.

375
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:58,880
Once more, I would ask you plainly.

376
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Do we or don't we relinquish Prince Roland to Azeroth?

377
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Critical decisions that may determine the fates of nations

378
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,880
are settled by vote on the scales of conviction.

379
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Use information you've gathered to sway allies toward your favored cause.

380
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,880
The story will significantly change based on how the votes are cast.

381
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,880
So they refuse to relinquish him to us.

382
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Lies! His hand was forced!

383
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Once more and more critical decisions are made,

384
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,880
your journey may take you down paths divergent from those of other players.

385
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,140
You will see what true might is!

386
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Project Triangle Strategy, a brand new tactical RPG.

387
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,140
I'm sorry, ever since Peter Molyneux told me that like,

388
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,140
they're fabled too.

389
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,140
I remember he talked about trees and shit and how the world was going to change.

390
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
I don't trust anybody anymore.

391
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:05,140
That tree that you plant there will turn in a hundred years into an ice cream truck.

392
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
I was like, holy shit, how the fuck's that going to happen, Peter Molyneux?

393
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,140
What are you talking about? That sounds insane.

394
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:18,019
And that tree's roots will go into the ground and create ten cities of ants and mice.

395
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,019
Like, okay, cool.

396
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,019
And I think the biggest decision in that game is like, you have a dog.

397
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,019
A dog? What kind of dog do you want?

398
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:35,079
There's like two different, three different kinds.

399
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:53,710
Oh shit, quiet.

400
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,710
Oh, I spelled Pog.

401
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,710
I was...

402
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,710
He's just winding the toy up, ready to like, Pog!

403
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,710
Pop up and Pog.

404
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,710
I didn't get a chance.

405
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:18,269
Gorgon love battle.

406
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,269
Gorgon use many weapons.

407
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:23,269
Triple-bladed war axe, spear of misery,

408
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,269
Hades soul-devouring crossbow.

409
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,269
A princess is supposed to lead her people,

410
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:31,269
not be stuck up in some tower waiting for a hero.

411
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,269
In my line of work, bullets are constantly whizzing past you.

412
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:37,269
Flaming longsword, blade of doom.

413
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:40,269
Just once, just once, I'd like to catch one of your bones.

414
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,269
Are these all Fortnite skins?

415
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:44,269
I don't know, the background's messing me up.

416
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:50,940
Look, it's simple.

417
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Gorgon want new weapon.

418
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
In Knockout City, I'm like a kung-fu master.

419
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
I can catch bullets.

420
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,920
That's cool.

421
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Alright, hold on.

422
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Is this dodgeball?

423
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Let's find out what sound your face makes.

424
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,190
Is this dodgeball? No, it's not.

425
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,190
No.

426
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:31,369
You can throw people.

427
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:40,640
We're losing to a bunch of farmers.

428
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Okay, team.

429
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
They may have won the battle, but not the war.

430
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Why is the switch so small?

431
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Why are the switches so t-

432
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Oh, no, no, no, they're controllers.

433
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,640
I was like, why do they have tiny, like, iPhone switches?

434
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Because the other people had the switches in their hands looking down.

435
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,000
We went up to- there was no TV, we were told of.

436
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,180
The big- the big orc guy had it in his hands looking down.

437
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,180
But there was no television they're looking at.

438
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,549
This is cameras.

439
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:09,549
No, I- I'm telling you, like, two people had the thing looking down at it.

440
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
The fight for survival starts now.

441
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,460
Hang on tight.

442
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Because you're all going to play a little game of fate for me.

443
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
They're not real.

444
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,460
From the creators of the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series comes the fight for your life.

445
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Literally, disoriented and trapped in an underwater theme park,

446
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,460
the twelve of you, known as the Go-Getters Club,

447
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,460
must now survive this game of fate at all costs.

448
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
I don't want to die yet!

449
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,960
Sorry to scare you all, but-

450
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
You are going to play this game.

451
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm not going to play this game.

452
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Well, no one's going to play it, I guess.

453
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
They got a call?

454
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Hey, uh, cut the direct off right here.

455
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
This thing's not coming out.

456
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,319
I feel like that would be really hard to do that.

457
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,319
All it takes is one person to fuck that up, the rhythm, and the whole fight goes down.

458
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,319
Ooh, this is a good game.

459
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,319
Physical release?

460
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,319
Oh, cool.

461
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,319
I thought I was going to say, I hate his original game.

462
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,319
Wait, what?

463
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,319
He played the Switch one.

464
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,319
And it comes with a PC code.

465
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,319
So, you don't have to play it on Switch.

466
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,319
That would be so funny.

467
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,319
What a great game.

468
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,319
Ninja Gaiden?

469
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,319
The four Dark Souls.

470
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,319
This was the Dark Souls.

471
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
This was like the hard game, right?

472
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
This was like the hardest game.

473
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,299
This was like the old Dark Souls, right?

474
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:32,299
Does this still hold up?

475
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,299
I don't think so.

476
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,299
I don't think so.

477
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,299
I don't think so.

478
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,299
I don't think so.

479
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,299
I don't think so.

480
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,299
Does this still hold up?

481
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,299
It does.

482
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,299
Ninja Gaiden is fucking hard.

483
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,299
Yeah.

484
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:07,539
Some of them are shit.

485
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:09,539
What's a good one?

486
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,539
This is harder than Dark Souls, yeah.

487
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,539
What does this say on the difficulty tier list?

488
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:25,539
Oh, a better question.

489
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:27,539
Where's Dark Souls on that tier list?

490
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:28,539
Is Dark Souls A?

491
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:29,539
B?

492
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:32,539
Ninja Gaiden is S tier?

493
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,539
Is it like one of the hardest series ever?

494
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,079
Dark Souls is like B+.

495
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:52,349
EOTW sucks.

496
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,349
I didn't say it.

497
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,349
I don't know what you're talking about.

498
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,349
I never played it.

499
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:05,369
Zelda sucks.

500
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:08,829
No, it doesn't.

501
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:12,630
Okay, can I...

502
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,630
I have...

503
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,799
This is important.

504
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,799
Do I get...

505
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:20,799
Do I get to have an opinion on like the current Zelda games if I have not played one since...

506
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,799
I gave up two hours into Twilight Princess?

507
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,799
Okay.

508
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,799
Yeah, I got to the part of Twilight Princess where I went in a chlorine filled pool and

509
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,799
then got out of the pool and opened my eyes and turned my head and looked at lights.

510
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,799
I got to that part.

511
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:09,750
Yeah, I got to the point of Twilight Princess where you had fucking chlorine eyes and I

512
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,750
stopped playing.

513
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,559
He got scared.

514
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,739
I don't remember any of these.

515
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,739
Remastered?

516
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,739
I don't remember any of this.

517
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:56,739
Were these games that came out like a decade ago or something?

518
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,739
Two decades ago?

519
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,739
It was in the Dreamcast.

520
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,739
Oh, okay.

521
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,739
Dinosaur?

522
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
Going good.

523
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,750
Super Mario Galaxy 3.

524
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,750
Super Mario Galaxy 3.

525
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,750
Coming up.

526
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm the producer of the Legend of Zelda series.

527
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I'm sure a lot of you saw me and thought there might be news about the sequel to the Legend

528
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
of Zelda Breath of the Wild game.

529
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Unfortunately, we don't have anything to share right now.

530
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
We apologize.

531
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Development is proceeding smoothly and we should be able to bring you some new information

532
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
this year.

533
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,840
For now, we'll have to ask you to wait just a bit longer.

534
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Just kidding.

535
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Here's the trailer.

536
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,840
While you're all waiting, however, this Legend of Zelda game will be coming to Nintendo Switch.

537
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Please take a look.

538
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,369
What you've just seen is the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD.

539
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:22,059
This game originally released in 2011 on the Wii console and now it's coming to Nintendo Switch.

540
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,880
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword featured a control scheme in which players would use

541
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,880
the Wii Remote Plus controller as a sword and the Nunchuk controller as a shield.

542
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,880
With the increased processing power of the Nintendo Switch system, the controls here

543
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
are smoother and even more intuitive.

544
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,179
And we've recreated the controls for the sword and the shield here by having the player

545
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,179
hold two Joy-Con controllers.

546
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,179
Oh, it's motion control.

547
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,179
Okay.

548
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:48,179
Nevermind.

549
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,179
I hate it.

550
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,179
Swing it to have Link swing his sword in the game.

551
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,610
The Joy-Con controller in your left hand is the shield.

552
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,610
You know how many times I'm going to be like, I'm getting the fucking sensor bar.

553
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,610
The sensor's not working.

554
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,610
I can't see anything.

555
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,610
This is stupid.

556
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,610
It doesn't work.

557
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,610
Look at the screen.

558
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,610
It's glitching.

559
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,610
It'll be half the picture.

560
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,610
These physical movements add a sense of urgency and tension to combat.

561
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,610
But we've also made it possible to play the game with button controls to ensure it can

562
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,610
be played in handheld mode or on the Nintendo Switch Lite system.

563
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,610
After mulling over how to assign different gameplay elements to different buttons, we

564
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,610
decided to apply the sword motions to tilting the right control stick.

565
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,610
What?

566
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,809
But how do you...

567
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,050
Tilt the stick down when you want to swing the sword downward.

568
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,050
Oh shit.

569
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:44,050
Swing to the right, to the left, or diagonally, just tilt the stick in the respective direction.

570
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,050
This looks actually, that looks pretty good.

571
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,679
Saved, saved, saved.

572
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,679
Here's something else we've been working on.

573
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,679
Specially designed Joy-Con controllers.

574
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,679
The right Joy-Con controller is themed after the Master Sword while the left features a

575
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,679
Hylian shield motif.

576
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,679
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword as the game depicting the earliest story in the Legend

577
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,679
of Zelda timeline details the events around the creation of the Master Sword itself.

578
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,820
We hope that people who played the original game on Wii and those playing it for the first

579
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,820
time will enjoy discovering the origins of the Legend of Zelda.

580
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,820
Joy-Con Drift.

581
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,829
Isn't that problem?

582
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,260
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD launches July 16th.

583
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:30,199
Following this Nintendo Direct, you'll be able to pre-order the game on Nintendo eShop.

584
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:34,199
And the specially designed Joy-Con controllers will launch on the game's release day at your

585
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,199
local retailers.

586
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,199
Many of you may already know this, but the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword was the last

587
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,199
original console game prior to the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild game.

588
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,199
And it was still following the established conventions of the Legend of Zelda.

589
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,199
However, it gave a glimpse into many features and innovations that would eventually be adopted

590
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,199
in the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

591
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,199
Using the sail cloth to descend in midair.

592
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,199
Oh, that looks fun.

593
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,199
A stamina gauge that depleted as you scaled walls.

594
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,199
Would I like Breath of the Wild?

595
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,199
Would I? Don't bullshit me here.

596
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,199
Give me the real story.

597
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,199
Would I really like this game?

598
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,199
I don't play Legend of Zelda.

599
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,199
I'm not a big fan of it.

600
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,199
I respect it as a series.

601
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,199
I think it's great for everything.

602
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,199
Without Legend of Zelda, we would have nothing.

603
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,199
We would have nothing.

604
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,199
It is the Dungeons and Dragons of modern adventure games.

605
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,199
I understand that.

606
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,199
Please look forward to the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD.

607
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,199
Would I like Breath of the Wild?

608
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,130
Well, what did you think?

609
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:32,130
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword has been optimized for Nintendo Switch.

610
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,130
It includes intuitive motion controls and button controls by tilting the right control stand.

611
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,130
How long do I cook bacon in an air fryer?

612
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,130
Okay, the next game will be our last announcement for today.

613
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,130
Epic.

614
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,130
Please take a look at this.

615
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,130
I don't know, but that was epic what you said.

616
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,130
I don't know why.

617
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,130
Something in that sentence.

618
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,320
I don't know.

619
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Put bacon in an air fryer?

620
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Cook it in like the fucking pan or the oven.

621
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,070
Be careful.

622
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:03,400
Is this...

623
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
Oh, shit.

624
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:16,280
Is this Splatoon 3 or is this like Splatoon RPG game?

625
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:24,349
Fallout Splatoon.

626
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Here it comes.

627
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,090
It's like, what the hell is this?

628
00:41:40,090 --> 00:42:03,070
Splatoon Rust.

629
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:43,369
What the hell is this game?

630
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:44,369
It's gonna be a skateboard.

631
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:47,150
Skateboard.

632
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Splatoon...

633
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
It's Splatoon 3.

634
00:42:50,900 --> 00:43:07,949
Oh.

635
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:08,949
Where are we dropping?

636
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:26,230
Come on, give me that one.

637
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,400
Of course you're gonna drop right there.

638
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
It's two teams on either side.

639
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Come on, that's the comedy.

640
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
That's the humor in that one I just said.

641
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,599
What the fuck?

642
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,550
2022.

643
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:44,559
Hold on.

644
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:54,579
What you've just seen is the latest installment in the Splatoon series, Splatoon 3.

645
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:59,579
This game is scheduled to launch in 2022, so it'll be a while.

646
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:05,780
We hope you'll stay tuned for more information at a later time.

647
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,780
I didn't really play it.

648
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Today, we showed you a sampling of games coming to Nintendo Switch.

649
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,599
A variety of games are in development.

650
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,599
And we look forward to sharing more news with you in the future.

651
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,599
That's all for today's Nintendo Direct.

652
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,599
That's not...

653
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,599
Thank you for watching.

654
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,090
No, it's not.

655
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,380
It's not over.

656
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:47,550
Well, that was the Nintendo Direct.

657
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,550
So, let me give you my thoughts.

658
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,000
What do we see?

659
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,079
What do we see?

660
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,829
We saw Super Mario Animal Crossing skins.

661
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:01,070
Kind of cool.

662
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,630
We saw...

663
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,510
What's wrong?

664
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,510
What are you doing?

665
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,809
No, I have...

666
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:07,809
It's my five o'clock shadow.

667
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,809
That's a five o'clock shadow.

668
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:10,809
Are you talking about up here?

669
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:11,809
Okay.

670
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,269
Well, I banned that person for three days.

671
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:16,269
It's like a beard.

672
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:19,750
You missed Team Fortress 3.

673
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,440
What did we saw?

674
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
We saw...

675
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,690
Why did I even turn the stream on for this?

676
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,889
One person told me to turn this on.

677
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:34,889
Somebody was like, dude, you're missing the Direct.

678
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:36,889
The fucking Nintendo Direct.

679
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,199
And I'm like, fuck, I got to get on there.

680
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,139
Why did I even stream that?

681
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,570
I mean, there was a couple of cool things.

682
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,570
What did I see?

683
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:52,230
Oh, Travis Touchdown.

684
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,230
No More Heroes 3.

685
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,920
It looked like it was going to be fun.

686
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,349
We got a release date, too.

687
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,349
August.

688
00:45:58,349 --> 00:45:59,349
Kind of far away.

689
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:01,360
Mario Golf, that's right.

690
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Mario Golf.

691
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
That's right.

692
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Mario Golf.

693
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,719
That's a PogChamp moment.

694
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:13,110
What else was there?

695
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,110
Ninja Gaiden.

696
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,010
All right.

697
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,070
Yeah.

698
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,070
No, that's true.

699
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,440
I mean, I could have rolled over in bed and opened Twitter and seen the first somebody

700
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
going, hey, there's a new Mario Golf.

701
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
That's so cool.

702
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,500
And I would just be like, yeah, that's pretty cool.

703
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,150
And I would just go back to bed.

704
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,150
That's like a rollover.

705
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,150
Like, that's a good surprise on Twitter this morning.

706
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,840
All right.

707
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,480
I'm going back to bed.

708
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
One Voice Andy.

709
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
What do you mean, One Voice Andy?

710
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,480
What are you talking about?

711
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
This is me.

712
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,480
What do you mean, One Voice Andy?

713
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
One Voice Andy.

714
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
You're a liar.

715
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,480
You made that up.

716
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
You have to lie.

717
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,360
All right.

718
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,730
Well, now we're going to play a game.

719
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:03,869
I'm going to get off the camera here because why would I need to be on camera anymore?

720
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:04,869
I'm going to play...

721
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:08,480
What the heck are we doing?

722
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,909
Slime Rancher.

723
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:10,909
That's right.

724
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:14,260
I'm going to play Slime Rancher.

725
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,260
I'm looking forward to it.

726
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,460
Let me get...

727
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,460
Just let me get BRB for one second.

728
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,710
I'm going to brush my teeth.

729
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
Get back on camera.

730
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710
Hold on.

731
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,710
I need to like change the Switch stuff.

732
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,710
I'll be right back.

733
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,710
Just watch Look at the Mart for a second.

734
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,710
I'll be right back.
