1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,330
Alright, I'm back. Sorry about that.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,019
Make a new green tea.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,769
But I'm here now.

4
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,929
How you guys doin'?

5
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,929
Alright, so how this is gonna work...

6
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:32,000
Couple things here. Cut the music off.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,880
Um, should I do like a OST in the background?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,310
What do you guys think?

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,310
Because here's how this is gonna work.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,380
I had this tier list that I found

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,560
has every single boss

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,740
across the entire franchise. All franchises.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,679
Uh, so I need to...

14
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,679
Obviously it's been a while since I've played any of these games.

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,049
I remember all these fights.

16
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,479
But I have a bunch of videos over here

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,560
of all just the boss fights.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,859
So I can just kind of scrub through and be like

19
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,859
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that person.

20
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:06,859
Okay, sure.

21
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,579
So I just need a refresher sometimes.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,459
All the Dark Souls 2 stuff, you guys did not see me play.

23
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:15,459
I did that off stream.

24
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:21,469
So, without further ado,

25
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,170
let's get an OST on. What do you guys think?

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,840
Any, uh, anything reaching out to you?

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Anything doing it for you?

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,099
I could put on the Bloodborne OST. That seems fitting.

29
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,540
We'll switch it up in a minute.

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,219
Okay.

31
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,450
I don't want it to be too loud.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:57,260
Okay, so that can just stay on.

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,379
This is the Bloodborne OST.

34
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:06,730
Without further ado, here we go.

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,340
So, take a look.

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,520
Here's what I got for you.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,550
I've got...

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,159
Uh, let me just make sure I got it correctly.

39
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
Do.

40
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,520
And this correctly as well.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,949
Which I do.

42
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:31,949
Okay.

43
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,949
So, here we go.

44
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,580
There's a lot here.

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,520
I can grow a little bit.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,620
Maybe in the bottom?

47
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,110
There are a shitload of names.

48
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:51,110
This is gonna be...

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,110
This is gonna be difficult.

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,110
We are going to start with Demon's Souls.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,800
He's growing.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,939
Is that better?

53
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,310
A little bit of white on either side or no?

54
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,580
That's good right there.

55
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,379
Okay.

56
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,289
Okay.

57
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,289
So, we're gonna start with Demon's Souls.

58
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,490
I need a refresher because I have no fucking idea.

59
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,490
The refresher is, by the way,

60
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
I have all the Demon's Souls fights right here.

61
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,069
So, let's get started.

62
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,069
Let me do the ones that I know for certain absolutely.

63
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,069
These are how I feel the best from software bosses.

64
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:35,069
The criteria.

65
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,259
Game mechanic-wise.

66
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,500
How cool they looked.

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
How...

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,120
Like, their animation style.

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,490
The damage they did.

70
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,490
How angry I got, right?

71
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,490
Like, what was the most universal best fight I've done in any of these games?

72
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,490
I can already tell you what the first one is.

73
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:00,310
Ludwig from Bloodborne is by far...

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,310
I'm not gonna say it yet,

75
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,310
but I think it's the best fight they've ever done.

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,960
Where's the soundtrack?

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,949
All right.

78
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,949
So, we're gonna go down to Bloodborne.

79
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:11,949
Here we are.

80
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:12,949
This is gonna be so hard.

81
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,189
This is gonna be way harder than I think.

82
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,189
Okay.

83
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,779
Okay.

84
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,529
Where is...

85
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,529
There is...

86
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,529
Okay.

87
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,410
I gotta move you all the way up here.

88
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,410
Those of you that don't know this fight,

89
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,100
it's the best fight From Software's ever done.

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
The second phase of this fight had an amazing reveal.

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,149
I don't want...

92
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,149
I don't necessarily need to spoil too much.

93
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:41,160
The music is incredible.

94
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
It's...

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
It's a full package.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,529
The boss fight is not too frustrating.

97
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,980
The first phase kind of is.

98
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,980
So, we know that's there.

99
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,670
100%.

100
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,620
The other one that's going up in S...

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Let me see if I can remember if I can find it.

102
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,860
It's from Dark Souls 3.

103
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
DLC.

104
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,100
Slave Knight Gale.

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,360
Absolutely one of the...

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Probably the second...

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
It's probably the second best fight they've ever done.

108
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,839
Right here.

109
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,430
I think...

110
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,740
Let's just get the S's done first.

111
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,060
I mean, I'm gonna put...

112
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Let's get Gwyn up here immediately, right?

113
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Like, I...

114
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Come on, Gwyn.

115
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Like, that was...

116
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
I don't know if that...

117
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
I think Gwyn is probably a B.

118
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,310
I think it's only...

119
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,310
It would be a C if it wasn't for the...

120
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Come on, Gwyn.

121
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,410
Alright, now...

122
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,410
What are the S's?

123
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,410
Guaranteed S's.

124
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,839
Where's Horolue?

125
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,170
Horolue from Elden Ring?

126
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,300
I gotta say, it's probably...

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Top...

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,610
It's gotta be at least A or S.

129
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,959
That whole fight was amazing.

130
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,959
I've never felt so...

131
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,199
Involved.

132
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,199
And my heart was just...

133
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,199
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

134
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,199
I was not annoyed.

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,199
I was not mad.

136
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,889
I was just truly...

137
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:07,889
In the zone.

138
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:08,889
It was really, really fun.

139
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,889
Alright, where is Horolue?

140
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,009
Uh...

141
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,009
It's gotta be pretty far down here, right?

142
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,759
Oh, yeah.

143
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,759
This part.

144
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Let's turn it up.

145
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,899
Horolue.

146
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,139
Oh, I can also make sure I do the ones that are literally zero.

147
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,139
That are like the worst I've ever done.

148
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,819
Let's do the top ones first.

149
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,189
Where are you?

150
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,189
There's so many names.

151
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,160
There you go.

152
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,189
Alright.

153
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,189
Horolue slash Godfrey.

154
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,189
It is technically the same fight.

155
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,430
That's going up to S.

156
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,569
Who else belongs at S?

157
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,319
I don't know if any of the Dark Souls 2 bosses are gonna be even A.

158
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,639
I don't think so.

159
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,639
I'm trying to remember.

160
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,100
You know who else I need to put pretty high?

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,009
Where is it?

162
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,810
Bloodborne.

163
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,810
Why is Brainsucker a boss?

164
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
Brainsucker wasn't a boss?

165
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:29,360
Um...

166
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,490
I knew this was gonna be hard.

167
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,490
Ibritas.

168
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,490
Ibritas was...

169
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,050
I don't think it's S.

170
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,050
But I'm gonna say B.

171
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,610
Ibritas is really cool.

172
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,610
That was just one of those reveal fights.

173
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,850
Where you walk in the door.

174
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,850
And it's just like...

175
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,850
It's so scary that this thing is even down here.

176
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,540
The fight was...

177
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Eh.

178
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,019
But I think the reveal was pretty cool.

179
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,019
Uh, where is...

180
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,180
All the Sekiro bosses.

181
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Oh, fuck all the Sekiro bosses.

182
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,339
Yeah.

183
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,339
I think all the Sekiro bosses are gonna be C or lower.

184
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:15,120
Although, probably not.

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
We have to take a look.

186
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,300
I might need a refresher.

187
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,620
We should probably go one game at a time.

188
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Alright, let's get a refresher here.

189
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
So this is Old Monk.

190
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
I forget what Old Monk was.

191
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,139
Old Monk.

192
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,689
Power Knight.

193
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,179
Flame Lurker?

194
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,740
No.

195
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Is Old Monk even on here?

196
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Was Old Monk even a boss fight?

197
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,980
Old Monk.

198
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,179
What do you got?

199
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,179
What happened here?

200
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:48,440
I forget this fight.

201
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,740
Old Monk is the invader.

202
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh, right, right, right.

203
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,389
I need a refresher though.

204
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,389
I mean, what the fuck?

205
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,870
Let's go.

206
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,100
Hello?

207
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Oh, there we go.

208
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,360
Okay.

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,139
So what happens here?

210
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,139
It's the guy that invades you.

211
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,019
Oh, with all the chairs.

212
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,019
I forgot about...

213
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,019
Yeah, this wasn't that bad.

214
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,429
Oh, yeah, he had the funny hat on.

215
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,860
Okay.

216
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Wasn't he really, really easy?

217
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,259
Okay, this guy was stupid.

218
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:27,519
Yeah, this guy was pretty stupid.

219
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,889
Um, he did have the funny hat on though.

220
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:35,950
Comedy hat puts you in C.

221
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,950
Where is the spider?

222
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,049
Armor spider.

223
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,860
C.

224
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,620
Alright, I'll give you one refresher on the armor spider.

225
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Here you go.

226
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,009
This is the one where you had to go down the hallway.

227
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,009
This...

228
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,009
Oh, I hated this.

229
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,740
This was stupid.

230
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah.

231
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,820
It starts back here.

232
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah, this boss was...

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Oh, this was awful.

234
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,389
Yeah, this is going way lower.

235
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,389
Yeah.

236
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,389
No, fuck this boss.

237
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:09,950
Oh, shit.

238
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,950
Here comes Gascoigne.

239
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,950
Might as well put Gascoigne now because his music is playing.

240
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,370
But let's...

241
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,370
Oh, yeah.

242
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,370
Armor is D.

243
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,179
That fight was awful.

244
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,179
Okay.

245
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,179
Let's get Gascoigne up there because he was probably A.

246
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,090
It's going to be very blood-borne.

247
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,330
It's going to be blood-borne heavy at the top.

248
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,980
Where's Gascoigne?

249
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Cleric beast.

250
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
I got to put...

251
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Okay.

252
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,100
One of the only times you're going to see a blood-borne boss be like somewhere near F

253
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
is cleric beast.

254
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,659
This boss was just stupid.

255
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,659
There's like a...

256
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,659
You fight it on the bridge.

257
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,659
It takes up the whole bridge.

258
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:49,659
It's annoying.

259
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,149
This boss sucked.

260
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,149
Cleric beast was awful.

261
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,700
It just...

262
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:03,580
I don't like you fighting the things on like the tiny little bridges where they take up

263
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
the whole thing.

264
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,690
Although these have...

265
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,690
These might change, but where's Gascoigne?

266
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,740
Oh, the Gascoigne.

267
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Alright.

268
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
This fight was awesome.

269
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Let's change into...

270
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Well, it's good.

271
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,970
Let's put it at A.

272
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,970
Put Pinwheel at S.

273
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,970
Pinwheel is...

274
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,970
Let's do that now.

275
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,970
F.

276
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,019
Hold on.

277
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,019
Stick with Demon's Souls for now.

278
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,899
The Adjuncticator.

279
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,899
What's the Adjuncticator?

280
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:37,899
Oh, Phalanx.

281
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,279
This is F, right?

282
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,279
Yeah.

283
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,279
This boss was stupid.

284
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,279
Yeah.

285
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,909
This thing was terrible.

286
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:56,460
Why is this lagging?

287
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
Why is it lagging?

288
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah.

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,419
That's going to go probably F or lower.

290
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,120
Because the fight was just...

291
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
It's a huge blob and the spears just stick out.

292
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
You're not even fighting a boss.

293
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
You're just fighting a big annoying thorn bush.

294
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
It's stupid.

295
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,419
That was Phalanx.

296
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,419
Okay.

297
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:29,639
Let me make sure this is right so far.

298
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,639
Yep.

299
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,159
Oh, Sif!

300
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,159
Wait.

301
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,159
Just stay in Demon's Souls.

302
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,159
I don't want to jump around.

303
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,159
Except for the ones that I know are going in F, which...

304
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,159
Where's Millenia?

305
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,940
Millenia is 100% F.

306
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:51,919
Wait.

307
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,919
Hold on.

308
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,919
Tibia Mariner.

309
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,919
We're going to get this one done right now, too.

310
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,629
The Tibia Mariner was like C, though, because it was funny.

311
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:04,840
Molting.

312
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,850
The Millenia fight was one of the worst things I've ever done in a Souls game.

313
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,279
And I know I said that for Isshin.

314
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,460
But nope.

315
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
No, Isshin is better.

316
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,889
Isshin is going down there, too, though.

317
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,649
Don't worry.

318
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:30,840
Where are you?

319
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,809
Godskin duel.

320
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:36,809
I like the Godskin stuff, but I feel like they showed up way too often.

321
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,139
I'll put Godric.

322
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,139
We'll do Godric.

323
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:46,090
I actually really liked that fight.

324
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,090
The music is great.

325
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,090
He laughs.

326
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,090
He has like a...

327
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,590
I like his moveset.

328
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,590
But I think...

329
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,590
Wait.

330
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,590
It's not gone today.

331
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,590
B plus for now.

332
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,769
For now.

333
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,399
Let's stay in Demon's Souls.

334
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,399
I'm going to all over the place.

335
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,399
Adjunct Cater.

336
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,399
What is that?

337
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,100
What is that?

338
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Was this the thing with Big Tongue?

339
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,600
It was like a big fat guy, right?

340
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:29,059
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,299
I remember this.

342
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,299
Wasn't this the fight that you had to...

343
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,299
Yeah, you had to stand up here and throw shit at it?

344
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,899
F.

345
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:38,899
Yeah.

346
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,940
Tiny room, huge boss is already a C or below.

347
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,710
Yeah.

348
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,789
This is at least a D.

349
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:57,700
All the tiny room, huge bosses are going to get at least a C or minus.

350
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Old Hero.

351
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Right here.

352
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:08,450
This music is too intense for me.

353
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,799
I think this music is too intense.

354
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:20,799
What do you think?

355
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,090
Another hallway boss, which I'm not a big fan of.

356
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,090
I think this guy actually had a pretty cool moveset though.

357
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,090
From what I remember.

358
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,539
I remember this guy being fun to fight against.

359
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:41,889
What else did he do?

360
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:47,330
Yeah, we need like Animal Crossing music or something.

361
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,330
This is like...

362
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,450
I feel like I need to be screaming at you.

363
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,450
Yeah.

364
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,200
This was solid.

365
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
I remember.

366
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,230
This was solid.

367
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,230
Yeah, let's put on like...

368
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,230
Yeah, let's put on like Stardew Valley or something.

369
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:10,259
Stardew Valley.

370
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,539
That's like in easy listening.

371
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,539
I don't know.

372
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,539
I feel like I need to be like...

373
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,539
Run.

374
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,539
Everybody run.

375
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:18,539
Hey, there we go.

376
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:19,539
Now we can do it.

377
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,539
Get back to this.

378
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:31,379
I'm going to put Old Hero in C.

379
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,330
Storm King.

380
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,330
Storm King.

381
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,830
Let's see.

382
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,830
What was this one?

383
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,830
I don't remember this at all.

384
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,460
And you're probably wondering, why do you not have the Demon's Souls remastered shit

385
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
up here?

386
00:16:43,460 --> 00:17:03,429
Because I haven't played it yet and I'm going to probably eventually.

387
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:11,329
Oh, yeah.

388
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,329
It was a giant moth.

389
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,890
Yeah.

390
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,690
This is cool.

391
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,690
It was...

392
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,690
This was a gimmick fight.

393
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,690
How much of a gimmick was it though?

394
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:29,380
It's a manta ray.

395
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,140
The Stardew Valley music makes this like weird.

396
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,789
It was a gimmick fight.

397
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,569
Yeah.

398
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,369
Oh, didn't I hate this?

399
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:46,970
I talked a lot of shit about this.

400
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,329
I think I distinctly said this was awful.

401
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,960
Yeah.

402
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,269
Yeah.

403
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,269
This was...

404
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:08,700
You had to get the cyclone thing and it was freaking loud too.

405
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,250
Yeah, that's not that great.

406
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,250
All right.

407
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,250
Storm King.

408
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,250
Let's...

409
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
What about Leechmonger?

410
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:25,019
We'll do three or four of them.

411
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,210
Leechmonger is here.

412
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,730
This is the one where when you just being in the room, you got hurt.

413
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,130
Oh, yeah.

414
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,809
I hated this.

415
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:44,809
Yeah.

416
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:47,799
And there was no rhyme or reason to that move at all.

417
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,160
His arms just like flail around.

418
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Yeah.

419
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
This fight was absolute dogshit.

420
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,230
Somebody said, Demon's Souls had some real stinkers.

421
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,539
Yeah.

422
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,250
Yeah.

423
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,250
That was terrible.

424
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,250
Okay.

425
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:09,309
Dirty Colossus.

426
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,390
Which one was this?

427
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,319
Honestly, I don't even remember fighting this.

428
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm gonna have to put this a D because I don't remember.

429
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,579
I don't even remember this being in the game.

430
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:29,579
Okay.

431
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,400
So, cool.

432
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,759
So, Storm King.

433
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,960
That was pretty gimmicky.

434
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,059
I don't think it's F though.

435
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,059
It's pretty stupid.

436
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,230
Leechmonger, F. Dirty Colossus.

437
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:57,339
I'm gonna give it an F too because I don't even remember playing it.

438
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,960
Or almost through Demon's Souls.

439
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,690
Where's Flame Lurker?

440
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,690
I remember Flame Lurker.

441
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,180
You know how I remember Flame Lurker?

442
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,099
Because I beat this first try.

443
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:15,740
And everyone was really, really confused that I was able to do it.

444
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,539
This fight was really bad, but just because I beat it first try does not mean it's a good

445
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:26,380
fight.

446
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Let me get refreshed on this again.

447
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:34,819
This is the guy that had all the explosions.

448
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,579
He jumped around a lot, right?

449
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,900
Let's get some, let's refresh.

450
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:46,299
Yeah.

451
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:58,740
This thing jumps all over the place and explodes.

452
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,940
It's cool, but yeah, those explosions were so horrible.

453
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:08,420
Even though I did beat it first try.

454
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Way too dank.

455
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,240
What?

456
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,539
Can't even hear anything.

457
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,339
I'm gonna keep it in B.

458
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:21,539
Maiden, Astria.

459
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:27,140
I don't remember this fight either.

460
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,690
And if I don't remember you, that means you're probably down on the list really low.

461
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,690
It's two.

462
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,690
Maiden, Astria, and Garl, Vinland?

463
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:44,069
What the fuck was this?

464
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,069
What?

465
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:54,130
I don't, how could you forget this?

466
00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:10,819
I just need to refresh my memory before I can tell you.

467
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,259
I don't remember doing this.

468
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:26,109
Wait, what?

469
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:29,079
Hold on.

470
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:44,720
You just get, you just walk down here and just kill her?

471
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
This is, all right.

472
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,029
I don't know about this.

473
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:51,900
I don't think this deserves to be anywhere higher than C.

474
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,369
But wait a minute.

475
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:00,190
It's a story boss?

476
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,029
Okay.

477
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,029
What about the penetrator?

478
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:11,740
Penetrator?

479
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,279
Where's the penetrator?

480
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,589
Dude, there's no penetrator.

481
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:20,589
Where's the penetrator?

482
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:35,299
Did you go by another name?

483
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,940
I went over it?

484
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,180
Old monk, man eater, bullseidle.

485
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Oh, penetrator.

486
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Okay.

487
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:51,809
I'm stupid.

488
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:52,809
Oh, I remember.

489
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:57,059
Yeah.

490
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,059
This was fun.

491
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:04,859
Give me a link to the list?

492
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:05,859
I will in a second.

493
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:10,819
I mean, kind of forgettable, but still fun.

494
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:17,150
I summoned an NPC on accident.

495
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,349
Okay.

496
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,349
Old king.

497
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:23,349
All right.

498
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:30,029
I remember the old king was a good, was a cool fight.

499
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:31,980
It was for a quest.

500
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,039
This is one of the last fights in the game.

501
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,470
Mm-hmm.

502
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,509
This was cool.

503
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,230
This was an easy last boss, but I don't think it was a bad fight.

504
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,230
It was a fun fight.

505
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:54,549
Yeah.

506
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:57,259
This was cool.

507
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:58,259
I need to do something else later as well.

508
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:07,519
This grab lowers your soul level, right?

509
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,460
Cool.

510
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
Okay.

511
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,450
Any more refreshers that I need before I do the rest of demon souls?

512
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:24,230
Primeval demon, I think I need to see.

513
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,230
I'm going to need this especially with the demon soul stuff.

514
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,230
It's been a long time.

515
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,180
Did I go over it again?

516
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Primeval demon.

517
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:46,369
I don't think this one's on here.

518
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,890
It's not an official boss.

519
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,839
Oh, I don't remember this one.

520
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,549
Turn the music off?

521
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:58,029
You never saw primeval demon.

522
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh, shit.

523
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,529
Turn it up.

524
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:12,170
It only spawns if you fuck the world up enough.

525
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,410
All right.

526
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,410
Well, then I can't place it.

527
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:24,880
I'm just going to put it down at, um, I'll add a category that says, let's call it, um,

528
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know is the category, but I didn't do it.

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,250
All right.

530
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,650
Only a couple more that I need to remember, but let's actually, let's, let's go back to

531
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,240
this and do these ones.

532
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,500
Okay.

533
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,539
Do primeval demon.

534
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,809
I didn't do it.

535
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:52,930
That maiden fight was, I mean, if you want to talk about in the entirety of all of from

536
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:58,970
software running down a hallway and killing five or six regular enemies to kill this lady

537
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,200
that's sitting on the ground.

538
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,680
I don't think compares with, uh, like father gas coin.

539
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,160
Okay.

540
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,960
But is that better than the phalanx?

541
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,289
Yeah.

542
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:17,019
Is that better than storm king?

543
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:19,480
No.

544
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,799
Cleric beast is better than armor spider armor.

545
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,049
But as a joke.

546
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,049
All right.

547
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:30,740
Penetrator.

548
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Was a good narrative.

549
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,980
Yeah.

550
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,700
I'll put this at C. All the, okay.

551
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,559
All the guy that has a sword in his hand, I'm probably going to all be C. I like this

552
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,559
fight.

553
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,660
I'm going to put it to be, it might change vanguard demon.

554
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,069
This is the, um, this is the asylum demon, right?

555
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:59,180
Yeah, it is.

556
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Yeah.

557
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:07,880
I mean, it's Ron Majula.

558
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Oh, you actually know I'll put on dark souls too.

559
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,440
It's got a great OST Ron Majula.

560
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,130
Yeah.

561
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,859
I'll do that.

562
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:23,339
Uh, vanguard is probably like D stardew valley.

563
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,880
Like, yeah, it doesn't fit, but nothing.

564
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
What does fit right now?

565
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,069
Okay.

566
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,460
Give me a sec.

567
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,779
Uh, where is it?

568
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:45,849
Majula.

569
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,849
Majula extended.

570
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:49,500
Ooh.

571
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,380
Okay.

572
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
All right.

573
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,880
This might be the best hub world music without, yeah, that's probably the best one.

574
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
All right.

575
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,170
Uh, vanguard demon is, I really want to put it in F, but it's a tutorial boss, so it kind

576
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,170
of can't be there.

577
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,309
I don't know.

578
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,430
What are you guys think?

579
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,039
It's a tutorial boss.

580
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,960
Should any tutorial boss be allowed to be over D?

581
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:35,470
I don't think so, but that's a better fight than the maiden fight.

582
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,380
The maiden fight is just, is, is a better, at least you actually fight.

583
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,029
Hmm.

584
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:46,339
I'll keep it here for now.

585
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh, there's also regular King Alant, right?

586
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,519
I already know where I'm putting like half of these, by the way.

587
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,680
I just saw this and immediately wanted to put it like down here.

588
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Okay.

589
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
What is, what's a regular Alant?

590
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,380
Well, let's, let's look at the rest of these.

591
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:20,119
Blue dragon, old King Alant, King Alant.

592
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,119
Was this the actual last fight?

593
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,769
I don't remember.

594
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:37,789
Wait, is this when you kill the, the thing in one hit?

595
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:43,519
Oh yeah, this was fucking stupid.

596
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:50,690
This was fucking stupid.

597
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,650
Why is he talking like the TikTok filter?

598
00:30:53,369 --> 00:31:02,799
Oh, I don't know what I'm seeing.

599
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,799
Okay.

600
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,799
That's not a good fight.

601
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,529
I mean, so, um, what about blue dragon?

602
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:11,529
Blue dragon and red dragon.

603
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:19,549
Power Knight was kind of, eh, like all the giants in Elden Ring.

604
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:40,380
Oh yeah, you could go up top.

605
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
This was actually pretty fun.

606
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,720
Let me get some more gameplay here.

607
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,329
Yeah, this was cool.

608
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:55,839
I remember it was a pain in the ass to kill the, uh, this stuff up top.

609
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,960
How come it's so long?

610
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,559
I think this is the guy that took a long time to kill it.

611
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,279
Yeah, no, this is cool.

612
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,279
I remember this.

613
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
It was, it was intense.

614
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
It was exhilarating.

615
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,849
Uh, so the dragon, the dragons were not technically bosses.

616
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:16,849
I don't, did I fight them?

617
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,410
I don't remember.

618
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:27,309
At least I can do these ones at this point.

619
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,880
Okay.

620
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,069
King Alant is F, but it's a funny F. It's not like a zero, right?

621
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:43,720
Oh, you want to link, right?

622
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,630
Hold on.

623
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:53,690
This is the one I'm using right now.

624
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,240
I don't even, why did I have to turn the screen off for that?

625
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,569
Power Knight.

626
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:01,569
Okay.

627
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:03,130
Was Tower Knight better than Penetrator?

628
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,130
Yes.

629
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,269
Was Tower Knight better than Old Hero?

630
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:07,269
Yes.

631
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:17,210
Was Tower Knight better than the Tibia Mariner?

632
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:30,359
Wait, actually, Tibia Mariner, I'm going to say no, I'll have to re, I have to think

633
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,359
about that again.

634
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,359
I just know what's going there.

635
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,730
So why not?

636
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,369
But Pinwheel, King, King Alant has to go all the way back here.

637
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:45,339
At least these are fights, but that's funny.

638
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:46,339
He makes funny sounds.

639
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh, I'm going to burp.

640
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
That's the worst.

641
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,980
I think that actually might be the worst thing From Software has ever made.

642
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,410
I think so.

643
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,480
The Bed of Chaos, I think is truly just, they just mushed a bunch of stuff together and

644
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,170
just pressed it.

645
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,170
It's so awful.

646
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,170
It's just not even close.

647
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,519
I don't think.

648
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,750
The whole area was just, they just rushed through it as fast as possible.

649
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,829
That's probably the worst thing they've ever done.

650
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:29,829
I know that.

651
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:30,829
I'm going ahead.

652
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:35,460
I know.

653
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,070
I'm going ahead.

654
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,070
I know.

655
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,070
The Mario slide?

656
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,070
Yeah.

657
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,230
I hated that shit.

658
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,230
Yeah, that's definitely where it belongs.

659
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,230
Okay.

660
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,230
Wait, let me, let's go back.

661
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,980
Let me, let's refresh.

662
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,349
Dragon God fucking blows.

663
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:59,150
Is that the one where it's just you, it's a cutscene, right?

664
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,150
This is a cutscene, boss.

665
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,559
Am I accurate on saying that?

666
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,559
I remember it's a cutscene.

667
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:12,150
Yeah, this is pretty awful.

668
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,150
It's the stealth one.

669
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,760
Yeah.

670
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
No, I remember that.

671
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,510
It was dumb.

672
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,199
Is it on the video?

673
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,199
Dragon God, right?

674
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,920
I think it was.

675
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,670
Yup.

676
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,670
Yeah.

677
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,670
He spits the fire everywhere.

678
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,670
Is this not even a boss?

679
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:40,119
He goes near bed of chaos.

680
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,119
Yes.

681
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,119
All right.

682
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,489
Yeah.

683
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:47,489
Yeah.

684
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,519
Yeah.

685
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,519
Yeah.

686
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,530
Yeah.

687
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,530
This is down here.

688
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,119
He's got one hit kills.

689
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,210
He looks cool.

690
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,210
I am taking coolness into consideration, but not that much.

691
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,349
It's definitely cooler than bed of chaos.

692
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:04,590
Okay.

693
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,750
So I know what that is.

694
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,750
Fool's idol.

695
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,190
Saw that down here, right?

696
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,480
What was this one?

697
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:24,239
Arch, right?

698
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,239
The floor traps.

699
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,239
Yeah.

700
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,000
This thing sucks too.

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,440
And again, another one of my big problems from software games, I don't like fighting

702
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,039
a boss in a corridor that is like there's one kind of straight line and a bunch of shit

703
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,000
in the way.

704
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,599
Yeah.

705
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,380
You can get stuck spell casting and like the midi file that is that laugh.

706
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,219
Okay.

707
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,219
What about the man eater?

708
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,219
We're almost done with Demon's Souls.

709
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:08,050
Oh yeah.

710
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,050
I remember this.

711
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:14,630
This sucked.

712
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,630
Oh my God.

713
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:24,400
Are no Demon's Souls bosses even remotely close?

714
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:37,530
I don't think a single Demon's Souls boss is going to make it out of B. Okay.

715
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,530
Don't you fight two?

716
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,530
Yeah.

717
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,530
All right.

718
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,530
Yeah.

719
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,530
Yeah.

720
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,530
Yeah.

721
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,920
This is F. Yeah.

722
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,289
This is like, it's absolutely F. You fight two of these.

723
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,289
It's stupid.

724
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:52,480
All right.

725
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,039
I think I can put these out.

726
00:37:54,039 --> 00:38:06,530
Uh, man eater is F. Fool's idol is like D. Man, this looks bad.

727
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,809
I don't remember these two.

728
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:12,079
Maybe I'll refresh my memory later.

729
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,079
Am I happy with this?

730
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,340
No, I'm not.

731
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:21,599
Cause Godric was definitely way cooler than the flame lurker.

732
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,800
I got to get Demon's Souls in the right place.

733
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,989
Is Gwyn better than flame lurker when the Gwyn fight kind of sucks though.

734
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:40,780
It's I'm only doing it because I say, come on Gwyn, like all the time, like seven years

735
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:52,449
later.

736
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:53,449
All right.

737
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:56,929
Is Ebritas better than Gwyn?

738
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:58,559
Yes.

739
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,920
Is old knight Alant better than Gwyn?

740
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,199
They're kind of the same thing for me.

741
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,199
They like in the same spot.

742
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:09,360
They feel very close in my brain.

743
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,840
I think this is good for me.

744
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,789
Ebritas is cooler than flame lurker.

745
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:20,000
Was the Tibia Mariner cooler than the monk?

746
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,480
I don't want recency bias to ruin this list.

747
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:37,150
No, I don't think so.

748
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,070
Hour knight probably cooler than Tibia Mariner.

749
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,570
Old hero probably cooler than Tibia Mariner.

750
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,780
Penetrator definitely not.

751
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,400
Lyric beast better than Penetrator.

752
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,719
Armor spider is bad.

753
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,159
Okay.

754
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:01,880
I think I'm okay with this so far.

755
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,769
Godric is at least a low A. I'm thinking about it.

756
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,730
I don't, I think gas coin was cool than Godric.

757
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,170
At least for now.

758
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,170
Give us the list.

759
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,170
I put it, I already put it in chat.

760
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,170
It's already there.

761
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,760
I already put it there.

762
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Am I too much of a big head?

763
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,559
Should I have like more space like here?

764
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,489
What do you guys think?

765
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:29,489
Right?

766
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:30,489
Like I'm just kind of like a big floating head.

767
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:36,659
Yeah, that's like better.

768
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:37,659
I'm like a person here now.

769
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm not just like, okay, that's better.

770
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,369
All right.

771
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:49,369
Ornstein and Sma.

772
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:50,369
Um, am I happy with this?

773
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:52,849
We're, we're, for now I am.

774
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:57,159
Beta chaos, worst.

775
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:03,519
Dragon god's probably low as well, but the, he was cool looking.

776
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:10,119
Vanguard demon is better than that.

777
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,869
The D and F is just all demon souls fights.

778
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:26,699
I kind of feel bad, but unless something changes, I think that this is correct.

779
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,690
Definitely cooler than the flame lurker.

780
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,610
Not cooler than Ibrutas in a way.

781
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,610
All right.

782
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,610
Now we're into Dark Souls 1 stuff.

783
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:36,769
I need some refreshers.

784
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:39,780
I have them, but I do remember most of these.

785
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:49,500
Moonlight butterfly was pretty cool, but was it cooler than the Tibia Mariner?

786
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
I don't know.

787
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:58,139
They're kind of the same fight.

788
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:03,989
Let's get the Taurus demon out of the way because it's just going to be down here.

789
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:04,989
All right.

790
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,989
Taurus demon is probably, they're the same exact fight, so why not just put them in the

791
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:16,559
same place?

792
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,559
Sif was cool.

793
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,860
I think Sif might have to be up in A for now or maybe high B. I don't want to go too high

794
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:34,590
with Sif.

795
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,760
Wait, the Taurus, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

796
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:40,159
The asylum demon and vanguard demon are the same.

797
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:46,030
Not the Taurus demon is the one on the bridge, which that was okay.

798
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,829
Again, these two are just in the same exact category for me.

799
00:42:49,829 --> 00:43:07,219
You're both on a bridge and you're both huge and you're both too big for the bridge.

800
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:09,920
This is the scorpion chaos witch, right?

801
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,250
The scorpion lady.

802
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,429
That was all right.

803
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:22,760
That didn't wow me, but it was okay.

804
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:29,800
The bell gargoyles were like, mm, they weren't great either.

805
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,409
Capra demon F. Even if that you beat that fight really easily, it's stupid.

806
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:35,409
It's a terrible fight.

807
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Let's make a room as big as an apartment bathroom and you fight this fucking annoying thing

808
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,539
in it.

809
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:43,539
And there's two dogs here.

810
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:48,750
It's awful.

811
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,559
I actually liked gaping dragon.

812
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:52,559
I like when he goes all the way forward.

813
00:43:52,559 --> 00:44:00,449
I don't know if it's a gaping dragon was a cool was cool.

814
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,480
It was a weird bus and weird.

815
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,469
It was a really weird fight.

816
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:06,670
He hates all these bosses.

817
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,119
No, I'm trying to be fair.

818
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,429
This is the one that just spams down the hall, right?

819
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:20,269
It's the fight is you just literally have to run down the hall with the magic.

820
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:21,760
The caster.

821
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Yes.

822
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,639
This is F.

823
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:36,260
But it's F.

824
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,610
That's F.

825
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,170
F is going to need a lot of moving around because I'm going to have to kind of go one

826
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,079
by one.

827
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,079
Nito.

828
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,760
Actually, let me get the other because I have the Dark Souls one bosses to get those up.

829
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,360
I remember Nito with Nito summons a bunch of shit, right?

830
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:01,019
Where is it?

831
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:02,579
Let's look at it.

832
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:03,579
Nito was was interesting, right?

833
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,579
From what I remember.

834
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm going to need this for a few of these does the undead guy come in here and he summons

835
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,679
a bunch of skeletons and you have to run around the circle and this guy actually has really

836
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:30,679
annoying moves.

837
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:36,599
Yeah.

838
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,599
He doesn't just chase you down.

839
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,659
This was horrible.

840
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:48,019
He's also in the worst area in the game.

841
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,119
I don't think this is F though.

842
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,719
I think the boss design is cool.

843
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,599
I mean, it's a big thing of melded together skeletons and summoned skeletons.

844
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,880
I think it was cool.

845
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,559
I don't think it belongs below C. I don't know if it goes below above B though.

846
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,739
Yeah.

847
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:06,739
Okay.

848
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,559
I remember that one.

849
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,559
The four kings.

850
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:18,889
This is the one where it's just pitch black, right?

851
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:19,889
This was all right.

852
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:30,389
The design of the boss carries this one.

853
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:33,389
The fight is F, but the design is like B.

854
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:37,179
So I think it's go somewhere in the middle.

855
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:38,179
Yeah.

856
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:39,179
This is stupid.

857
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,179
Yeah.

858
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:41,179
Yeah.

859
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:42,179
Yeah.

860
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:43,179
Yeah.

861
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,179
Yeah.

862
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:48,110
Yeah.

863
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:52,289
Yeah.

864
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:53,289
Yeah.

865
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:56,320
Yeah.

866
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Yeah.

867
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,199
Yeah.

868
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:00,199
Yeah.

869
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,199
Yeah.

870
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,199
Yeah.

871
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:04,530
Yeah.

872
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,530
Yeah.

873
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,530
Yeah.

874
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,530
Yeah.

875
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,530
Yeah.

876
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,539
Yeah.

877
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:11,539
Yeah.

878
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,780
Yeah.

879
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah.

880
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
All right.

881
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,780
Demon.

882
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,780
Is this the one where it has the stupid thing that you just walk into?

883
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:25,429
I actually might put this below bed of chaos just because of how truly dumb this thing

884
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:29,929
was.

885
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:30,929
Yeah.

886
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:34,320
The Capra Demon takes three hits to kill.

887
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,239
There's nothing fun about this.

888
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,239
Art equals bad.

889
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:43,440
I mean, but objectively speaking, this area is stupid.

890
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
This boss is stupid.

891
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,570
Look, the person even making the video on let me show you the bosses is having trouble

892
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,510
with this because of how annoying this is.

893
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:03,000
And the guy in the video showing us this encounter is that he can't even do anything.

894
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,900
This is a way useful.

895
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,900
You fight this piece of shit.

896
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,250
He's gonna die.

897
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:21,139
Yeah.

898
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,139
You got to let him.

899
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,139
That's it.

900
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:25,019
That's what you do.

901
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:27,539
Yeah.

902
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,539
Okay.

903
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,539
My opinion is validated for myself.

904
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:30,539
Okay.

905
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:33,030
The Demon Fire Sage.

906
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,590
This is the one that had the area was small and you'd walk backwards and fall directly

907
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,590
into the lava and die.

908
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,360
Right?

909
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,320
Because that was annoying.

910
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,880
The fights actually get the fight.

911
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Yeah.

912
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,039
The fight's actually kind of fun though.

913
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,320
I wouldn't say it's a bad fight.

914
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Demon Fire Sage.

915
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,320
Where the fuck is this?

916
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:09,670
I'm like halfway through the game, right?

917
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,670
Elgar Goyles.

918
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,289
Where is it?

919
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:13,289
The right?

920
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,289
Did I miss it again?

921
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:18,269
Am I still doing this?

922
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:19,269
War Kings pinwheel.

923
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:20,269
Cease.

924
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:22,030
Is it not ceaseless discharge?

925
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,760
No.

926
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,079
Read video description for timestamps.

927
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:35,480
But I mean, it's right here.

928
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
It's right here.

929
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
Like, how have I not seen it?

930
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,420
This shit's not even here.

931
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,519
I'm not gonna go look until I find it because I really don't think it's here.

932
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,519
Stray Demon?

933
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:55,130
It's not...

934
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,130
Oh, there it is.

935
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:03,519
Okay.

936
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,440
Ceaseless discharge is what I was thinking of.

937
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,480
This is just an Asylum Demon that has fire.

938
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,579
I'm gonna say pretty low.

939
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:20,539
It's probably better if I would put it above Asylum Demon because at least it's a different

940
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:21,539
thing.

941
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:27,199
He's on fire.

942
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,039
Yeah, okay.

943
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:44,760
I need Centipede Demon which is right here.

944
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:55,750
I don't remember this one.

945
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,710
I think a lot of the ones I don't remember I blocked out of my memory because I might

946
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,030
have hated them so much.

947
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,539
This guy almost just died instantly.

948
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:15,019
What the hell happened?

949
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:17,059
This guy's character looks like such a goofball.

950
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah, no, no, no.

951
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's coming back to me.

952
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:33,719
Because you have to put a ring on, right?

953
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,159
You need the lava ring.

954
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,820
Yeah.

955
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,000
Okay.

956
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Cool.

957
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I remember Seath.

958
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,989
Seath is, design-wise, I think is at least A.

959
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:58,639
It's such a weird, just kind of like gooey.

960
00:51:58,639 --> 00:51:59,960
This fight was not fun though.

961
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,630
It was kind of sloppy.

962
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,389
I love the way this dragon looks.

963
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:23,639
This, eh, I don't think it's that bad.

964
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:24,639
It's a cool fight.

965
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,840
It's, well, the fight's not great, but it's not terrible.

966
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
Okay, yeah.

967
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,960
I'd say that goes somewhere in C.

968
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,889
Alright, Stray Demon.

969
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:41,210
This is the one that, after Stray Demon we'll do some placement, Stray Demons.

970
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,809
The one, okay, I don't think I even need to look at Stray Demon.

971
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:53,590
That's the one that you fall through the ground and it's just an Asylum Demon, right?

972
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,809
The surprising factor makes this kind of cool, but the actual boss is just another Asylum

973
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:05,369
Demon with a couple extra attacks, yeah.

974
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:11,250
Okay, I can do some placement.

975
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,250
I think I got it.

976
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:18,230
I got some placement here.

977
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:28,190
Uh, Nito's going up to C. Four kings are D. I-D though, for now.

978
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:33,320
Centipede team, uh, D. Do I even like these games?

979
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,800
Demon Fire Sage was, oh no, it was Seath.

980
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:49,789
Seath is like C. Stray Demon is like D. Demon's Fire Sage was

981
00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:54,510
just, it's just another Demon.

982
00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:02,000
How come the Storm King is so low?

983
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm just trying to get things out.

984
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,679
This is a very hard thing to do.

985
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,360
Barely anything is above average right now.

986
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:16,000
I fucking hate From Software games, apparently.

987
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,199
I remember the DLC fights where, okay, this, the night.

988
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:22,599
I remember the night being really, really fun.

989
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,360
The night was really cool, actually.

990
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,980
This is one of those fights that I remember was cool.

991
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,059
Like I actually really enjoyed it.

992
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,489
Night, Artorias.

993
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:48,389
Let me just, let me refresh my memory.

994
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:55,199
This is the guy that uses one, the one hand to swing, right?

995
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,199
The one handed knight.

996
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:01,670
Yeah, this was awesome.

997
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,289
This is going at least today.

998
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:11,260
And you want to know why Gale is at S?

999
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,909
Because this fight, Gale was just kind of a cooler version of this fight.

1000
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:30,329
I mean, let me refresh my memory.

1001
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,690
All the cool swings with the one arm.

1002
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,690
Yeah, this fight was awesome.

1003
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:41,579
I mean, he's going to kill it in like fucking five seconds, but you know, with a thousand

1004
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:47,059
damaged sorceries.

1005
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,940
This was really fun though, I remember.

1006
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,809
This was a dance.

1007
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:56,889
This is one of those From Software fights where they got it really right because it

1008
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:04,079
really does feel like a fencing match between the two characters.

1009
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,719
That's why I like Horror Lou so much.

1010
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:10,539
That felt like I was fighting that boss.

1011
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:12,659
It was a back and forth dance.

1012
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:14,739
That's why Horror Lou might actually be number one.

1013
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:19,699
Okay, I know where that's going.

1014
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:22,280
That's going up pretty high.

1015
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,119
Sanctuary of Guardian, I think I hated, right?

1016
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,440
It was just like this thing.

1017
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:36,989
Yeah, don't you fight two of them too at some point as well and it's just annoying.

1018
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:53,539
He's killing him so fast.

1019
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:54,539
I just need refreshers.

1020
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:58,210
That one was alright.

1021
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,170
I remember being angry at the way you have to fight two, so that's kind of souring how

1022
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,349
I feel about fighting the one.

1023
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:07,190
Which I hope that doesn't happen with the Elden Ring bosses, because needing to fight

1024
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:11,239
two of those godskin apostles was just, come on.

1025
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:14,800
Fighting two of this thing was always just annoying, and it might sour.

1026
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,320
Alright, I'm just checking the rest of the DLC.

1027
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,329
We have Crossbreed Priscilla, I don't remember this.

1028
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:37,889
Oh, I do remember this.

1029
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:42,159
This is the invisible fight.

1030
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,159
And it was awful.

1031
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:51,510
Yeah, you fight the invisible character.

1032
00:57:51,510 --> 00:58:01,059
Yeah, come on.

1033
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:07,679
Where is it?

1034
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:08,679
Wait, what?

1035
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:13,789
They just beat it in one hit?

1036
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:28,670
Alright, we need the Dragon Calamite, and then Manus, and Iron Golem was alright.

1037
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:31,070
Alright, what about the Dragon Calamite?

1038
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:54,900
Yeah, this was cool.

1039
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,340
You know what's going to be really, really sad though, for when this was a fun fight?

1040
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,460
Oh my goodness, does it even hold a candle to even one of the dragon fights in Elden

1041
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,300
Ring?

1042
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,559
How do you put this even close to Placidix?

1043
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:14,559
I don't know.

1044
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,099
That's going to be hard.

1045
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,460
Then let's round it out, Iron Golem, just so I can make sure I know.

1046
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:34,070
It was pretty early, right?

1047
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,070
It's so much better.

1048
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,730
Better than the Overworld Dragons.

1049
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,929
Yeah, that's true.

1050
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:46,349
But that first encounter with Agil was ridiculous.

1051
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:56,809
It's just kind of a tower knight, but maybe not as cool.

1052
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:03,659
Yeah, it's another one of those things where I fight me on a tiny area.

1053
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:12,639
Yeah, this is a D. Or like a high D.

1054
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:18,320
Alright, it's time to place.

1055
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,320
I got enough info.

1056
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,570
Welcome back.

1057
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,570
Uh, this is...

1058
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,170
I mean, the fight is just, she's invisible.

1059
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,170
Invisible.

1060
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:38,739
How do you give that a high score?

1061
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:45,159
I don't think it's worse than the Four Kings.

1062
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:48,400
Sanctuary Guardian was cool, I'll get these right.

1063
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,440
Dragon, I'm going to put in B for now, but just keep in mind that Ibritas is in B as

1064
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,440
well.

1065
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,460
B does not mean bad.

1066
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,579
Oh, the Ceaseless Discharge, that thing, yeah.

1067
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:08,719
This thing was like a C. That's where you fall, yeah, fuck that thing.

1068
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,239
I didn't see Manus, did I?

1069
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:25,719
No, did I see Manus?

1070
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,239
Oh yeah, this thing was crazy.

1071
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:38,050
Yeah, this thing was actually really cool.

1072
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:44,960
It's just what all the Asylum Demons like wished they were as a fight.

1073
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:52,780
Mm-hmm.

1074
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,820
Yeah, this is at least a B. Alright, Dark Souls 1 is a- I- we're gonna take a minute

1075
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,949
here because I need to make sure these are in the right spot.

1076
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:07,989
I'm gonna put this in B for now.

1077
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:11,750
Dark Souls 2 is gonna be as hard as Demon's Souls because it's been a very long time since

1078
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,150
I've played Dark Souls 2.

1079
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:20,960
I'm actually probably gonna do that last.

1080
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,889
So, let's begin.

1081
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:30,630
Ornstein and Smog.

1082
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,150
Was our Artorias cooler than Sif?

1083
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:38,079
Was he more fun, more interesting?

1084
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,079
I don't know.

1085
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:49,489
Everybody, look, I know that From Software has put a like wolf or like an animal with

1086
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,170
like a sword in his mouth.

1087
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:56,679
I know they've done like the look it's a wolf enemy again like a thousand times.

1088
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:10,440
But in Dark Souls 1, that first seeing that for the first time was really cool.

1089
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:16,199
I'm gonna keep it there for now.

1090
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:18,639
Is Ibritas better than Artorias?

1091
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,849
God, I fucking love Bloodborne.

1092
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:23,849
I just do.

1093
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:24,849
I'm so biased.

1094
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:25,849
It's awful.

1095
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:28,500
I'm so biased.

1096
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,860
Because the music, Ibritas' music is so cool.

1097
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:39,820
That like, it's just such a, it's amazing.

1098
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,780
Music in Bloodborne makes these bosses better.

1099
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:52,119
That like, it felt like I was on a cosmic journey.

1100
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:59,380
It's going up here.

1101
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:04,269
This might change.

1102
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:08,900
Gaping Dragon is probably not close to this.

1103
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,900
You should play it.

1104
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,900
Yeah!

1105
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,900
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1106
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,170
I don't know why I keep pressing that button.

1107
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,170
I'm an idiot.

1108
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:26,409
Here it comes.

1109
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:27,409
Turn it up.

1110
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:38,820
I'm gonna put both headphones in this because Ibritas might go higher.

1111
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:47,920
Bloodborne's music is by far the best out of any of these games, without a doubt.

1112
01:04:47,920 --> 01:05:28,039
Wait for it.

1113
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:29,039
Godric's music is good too.

1114
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,880
And you know what makes a good song for me?

1115
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,880
It's, I've figured it out.

1116
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Any of the bosses that have like the...

1117
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:42,440
Ludwig has it.

1118
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Godric has it.

1119
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,440
Ibritas has it.

1120
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,380
They all have it.

1121
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,900
Not the chorus.

1122
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,139
Godric's music does this thing where it goes, is it a violin?

1123
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:55,139
What's that instrument?

1124
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:57,730
If it has a violin, I like it.

1125
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:06,590
Okay.

1126
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:07,889
Let's keep going.

1127
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:08,889
I think these are in the right spot.

1128
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:09,889
Gwyn is probably...

1129
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:10,889
Flame Lurker and Gwyn are like this.

1130
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,889
Like these are all like the same fight.

1131
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:19,809
Doesn't really matter.

1132
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,909
This is cooler.

1133
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:21,909
This is cooler.

1134
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,940
This is cooler than Flame Lurker.

1135
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,940
Ornstein and Smog was probably...

1136
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:34,469
Yeah.

1137
01:06:34,469 --> 01:06:35,949
Slave Knight Gael's music was amazing.

1138
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:36,949
Oh yeah, it was.

1139
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:43,849
Ludwig's music is the best, without a doubt.

1140
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:48,610
Nothing compares.

1141
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,610
What about Medir?

1142
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,849
Alright, let's get this right.

1143
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:52,849
That looks good.

1144
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:53,849
That looks good.

1145
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:54,849
That looks good.

1146
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:55,849
Gaping Dragon is in a good spot.

1147
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:56,849
I think Gaping...

1148
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:57,849
Gwyn's probably...

1149
01:06:57,849 --> 01:06:58,849
Gaping Dragon, I don't know.

1150
01:06:58,849 --> 01:06:59,849
It's so hard to tell.

1151
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,349
I just...

1152
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:05,710
I think Ibritas is cooler than Sif.

1153
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:06,710
I do.

1154
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,150
Alright.

1155
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,780
Go down here.

1156
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,780
Four Kings is better than this.

1157
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:22,719
I'm going to put this pretty low.

1158
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:32,429
I so badly want to put the Armor Spider lower, but I don't think I can.

1159
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:36,360
This sucked.

1160
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,969
I almost feel like somebody needs to level up here.

1161
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:45,929
I don't know which one's going to level up.

1162
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:46,929
These are all the same.

1163
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:56,880
Xenopy Demon, what's the worst out of all of these?

1164
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,880
Probably these, right?

1165
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,780
Yeah, Junk Decatur's so bad.

1166
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,780
It's going down here too.

1167
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,269
I just got a baby formula add?

1168
01:08:08,269 --> 01:08:15,869
I don't know how you fucking got that.

1169
01:08:15,869 --> 01:08:18,670
Was the Penetrator that bad of a fight?

1170
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:23,100
Or was it just kind of like...

1171
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,579
I feel like it doesn't belong down there.

1172
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:37,810
It was a regular enemy.

1173
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,810
I think it should be.

1174
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,810
I mean, it was still...

1175
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,810
It's cooler than the Four Kings.

1176
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:43,850
The Four Kings is just a pitch black room and they teleport next to you.

1177
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:51,260
I'm alright with this for now.

1178
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,699
Now for Bloodborne, I am not going to need to do any...

1179
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:56,460
I don't need to refresh at all for Bloodborne.

1180
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,210
I know all of these by heart.

1181
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,170
Maybe some of them I might want to just take a quick look at.

1182
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,020
So we're going to skip Dark Souls 2 for now.

1183
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:13,500
Because Dark Souls 2, that's going to take us the longest time, I think.

1184
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,260
Yeah, I'll remember you.

1185
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,260
Yeah, it's better that way.

1186
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,260
It's more fun.

1187
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:21,289
So let's open up...

1188
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:22,289
Let's get Bloodborne up here.

1189
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:26,500
Because Dark Souls 1 is complete.

1190
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,409
Nobody from Dark Souls 1 got to S.

1191
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:34,649
Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring all have a representative up here at S.

1192
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:36,869
Dark Souls 1 does not.

1193
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:42,500
Is that fair?

1194
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,760
I think so.

1195
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,350
I think so.

1196
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,779
Okay.

1197
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:54,779
Bloodborne time.

1198
01:09:56,010 --> 01:10:02,369
So if you remember from Bloodborne, Leric Beast is already up there at S.

1199
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:08,180
Eh, I think that's fine where it is.

1200
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:13,829
So we've got the one Reborn, which I believe this fight was...

1201
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:16,189
I wasn't a big fan of it, but let's refresh our memory.

1202
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:18,989
There's the big blob enemy, right?

1203
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:25,789
Yeah, this is just a huge blob.

1204
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:32,539
This thing was annoying.

1205
01:10:32,539 --> 01:10:34,020
This is probably going to be one of the lower ones.

1206
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:45,060
Okay, let's put it up here.

1207
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,020
I don't know where Rom's going to go.

1208
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,859
Rom's area and Rom's scariness was there, but nothing else for me.

1209
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:56,159
Yeah, this fight was...

1210
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,159
I didn't like this.

1211
01:10:57,159 --> 01:11:08,539
I actually didn't really like this area that much either.

1212
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:09,539
The thing to swing...

1213
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:14,100
All of its extremities were just always attacking, and it was no opportunity to do anything.

1214
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,100
Just spit a bunch of...

1215
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Yeah, this thing was...

1216
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:21,100
Yeah, this is one of the worst bosses in the game.

1217
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,100
F?

1218
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,460
Yeah, I agree.

1219
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
I agree.

1220
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,090
Oh no, F for frames.

1221
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,140
Oh, come on.

1222
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,260
Really?

1223
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:48,109
I was just going so good for a while.

1224
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:50,109
Why does Twitch hate my connection?

1225
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:58,539
Why, Twitch, why do you hate my connection?

1226
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:04,699
What did I do?

1227
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:05,699
Write it out for a sec.

1228
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:12,260
Are we alright?

1229
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:19,779
I think we're okay.

1230
01:12:19,779 --> 01:12:23,979
I wish I had a solution.

1231
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:24,979
If I open...

1232
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,539
If I do a speed test right now, it'll be perfect.

1233
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:28,289
I don't get it.

1234
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:34,649
What?

1235
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:35,649
Why is everybody Omega lowing?

1236
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:42,949
What?

1237
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:43,949
Why is everybody...

1238
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:45,430
Why was there so many Omega lows?

1239
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:50,130
There was a lot.

1240
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,130
Is it the bitrate?

1241
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,130
No, it's not...

1242
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:53,430
The bit...

1243
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,430
It's just...

1244
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:55,430
I'm losing packets to Twitch.

1245
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,649
The only service it's happening to.

1246
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:03,310
And I think it's okay.

1247
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,319
I don't know.

1248
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:08,939
Alright, yeah, but I do agree with you though.

1249
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:15,539
I think the one Reborn should be F, if not very close.

1250
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:20,979
I'll put it at low D for now.

1251
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:25,020
The music's gotta change as well here.

1252
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,699
That was cool for a little bit, but let's get that off.

1253
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:30,670
Something else.

1254
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,670
Anything else you guys want to put up?

1255
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,670
Any songs?

1256
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:44,079
Why is everybody saying Omega low?

1257
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:45,079
Firelink Shrine?

1258
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:55,149
Yeah.

1259
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:56,149
We'll do some Melodin Ring as well.

1260
01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:01,149
Okay, let's put that down.

1261
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:03,770
Let's do some more refreshing, please.

1262
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,649
I'd like if we could do some more refreshing.

1263
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:10,050
Alright, that's the one Reborn.

1264
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,050
Awful.

1265
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,699
Let's do...

1266
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:20,789
You already know these ones.

1267
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:25,869
Blood Star Beast was not a flashy fight, but it was interesting at least.

1268
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:28,380
It was hard.

1269
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,020
You could make this fight really trivial if you have an item, and then the fight is essentially

1270
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:41,840
a free boss kill.

1271
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
You're making shit up?

1272
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,659
What?

1273
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:51,850
I'm not making shit up.

1274
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,489
You throw one of those skulls into the wall and the Blood Star Beast just goes and attacks

1275
01:14:55,489 --> 01:14:58,489
it and you just get like a thousand damage for free.

1276
01:14:58,489 --> 01:15:00,050
Five thousand.

1277
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:07,390
Alright, what about some other ones I need?

1278
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:11,060
I liked Vicar Emilia's fight.

1279
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,060
This was really cool.

1280
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,260
Nobody tell him.

1281
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
What?

1282
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:20,460
What happened?

1283
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:28,390
Why are you guys doing this to me?

1284
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,930
What's going on?

1285
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:33,930
I don't know.

1286
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,930
I don't know.

1287
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,699
Are they just trolling?

1288
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:41,449
Yeah, this fight was really, really intense.

1289
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:43,050
It was scary too.

1290
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,250
Witches of Hemwick.

1291
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:55,789
This is F. It's one of those just there's four or five of them just standing in corners

1292
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:56,789
just kill them.

1293
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:57,789
Yeah, this fight was awful.

1294
01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:07,289
Mm-hmm.

1295
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:11,020
Okay.

1296
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:14,310
Let me wait.

1297
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:17,960
What else do we need a refresher on?

1298
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,960
Shadows of Yharnam.

1299
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
This fight was another just three enemies in the same room.

1300
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,399
I did it with the snakes though, right?

1301
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,239
This was actually pretty cool.

1302
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:35,800
I don't know if this is going higher than like a B or a C, but I think it belongs somewhere.

1303
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,130
It was easy.

1304
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:46,619
I don't remember this being that easy.

1305
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:53,949
I thought this was kind of a pain in the ass.

1306
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:55,869
They turn into a snake.

1307
01:16:55,869 --> 01:16:56,869
That was really cool.

1308
01:16:56,869 --> 01:16:57,869
Did they show that part?

1309
01:16:57,869 --> 01:16:59,300
Yeah.

1310
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,140
Right there.

1311
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,229
Ah, this fight's cool.

1312
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:10,890
I like it.

1313
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:11,890
Who else do we need?

1314
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:14,260
Rom was all right.

1315
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,260
Rom was cool because of the area.

1316
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,989
The fight was stupid.

1317
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:28,140
Okay.

1318
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:34,149
Rom did this really annoying thing where if Rom rolled, it did this kind of roll, roll

1319
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,649
move where he would spin around and it killed you in one hit.

1320
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:41,449
It was stupid.

1321
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:44,859
Okay.

1322
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:45,859
This fight was kind of disappointing.

1323
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:51,939
The Amigdala fight, this was a disappointment for me.

1324
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:56,109
I remember these are the things, like you're so scared of these things the entire game

1325
01:17:56,109 --> 01:17:58,590
and it's just kind of a boring fight.

1326
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:03,989
It just shoots lasers.

1327
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:06,869
This fight wasn't as scary as the enemy was hanging around.

1328
01:18:06,869 --> 01:18:13,020
Does it have the laser move?

1329
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,880
Maybe that'll help.

1330
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,100
Hmm.

1331
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,409
Eh.

1332
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:23,479
Eh.

1333
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:26,189
It's all right.

1334
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:32,460
You know that one, this is the electricity monster, which I'll give you a refresher.

1335
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,659
By the way, if you haven't played any of these games, you probably shouldn't be watching

1336
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:43,479
this stream because you're just getting spoiled on every single enemy.

1337
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:44,659
This was okay too.

1338
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:47,579
I wouldn't put it very high, but cool.

1339
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:59,619
Okay.

1340
01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:00,619
Artir Lugarius.

1341
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:04,689
Oh, this is the old guy.

1342
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:05,989
Right.

1343
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:07,710
This, I actually liked this fight.

1344
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:13,619
Yep.

1345
01:19:13,619 --> 01:19:14,939
I actually liked this one a lot.

1346
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:22,739
He was cool.

1347
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:23,739
You cried here?

1348
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:24,739
I didn't stream Bloodborne.

1349
01:19:24,739 --> 01:19:25,739
I played it on my own.

1350
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:34,720
This is before I was a streamer.

1351
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,199
It was a camera fight.

1352
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:39,800
Yeah, he was rough, but I still feel like he was fun to play against.

1353
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,539
Okay.

1354
01:19:43,539 --> 01:19:48,050
I'm going to turn off the fucking...

1355
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:52,569
I feel like I am idling right now in Dark Souls.

1356
01:19:52,569 --> 01:19:58,819
I'm just sitting at the bonfire at the Firelink Shrine and it's driving me fucking crazy.

1357
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:00,699
I feel like I want to alt tab and close the game.

1358
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:05,689
We don't need a soundtrack for right now.

1359
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:06,689
We're good.

1360
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:09,539
We can change it when we need to.

1361
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,539
Okay.

1362
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,380
Let's keep going.

1363
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,380
All right.

1364
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,699
Well, we have our audio right here.

1365
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:19,699
Celestial Emissary?

1366
01:20:19,699 --> 01:20:21,960
This is bad.

1367
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,060
Fuck, man.

1368
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:33,460
Is there a lot of Bloodborne bosses that are like D?

1369
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:44,779
I might surprise myself a lot because this is absolutely like D or lower.

1370
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:51,890
If you guys see me put the deacons higher than this, if they're not on the same line,

1371
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,050
this whole list is wrong.

1372
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:56,979
Yeah.

1373
01:20:56,979 --> 01:20:57,979
Okay.

1374
01:20:57,979 --> 01:20:59,659
That...

1375
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:00,659
It's Ibritas, by the way.

1376
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:01,859
You're wondering why I like it so much.

1377
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:03,500
The thing is just so crazy looking and so cool.

1378
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,369
Look at this thing.

1379
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:08,369
It's so crazy.

1380
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:09,670
Crazy!

1381
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:16,289
And it goes like...

1382
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:24,569
Okay.

1383
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:25,729
Yeah.

1384
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:27,739
Wait.

1385
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:29,489
Hold on.

1386
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:30,489
Here comes the music.

1387
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:39,750
I want to hear the music one more time.

1388
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:45,220
Here it comes.

1389
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,220
Come on.

1390
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:56,500
Here it comes.

1391
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:08,619
Don't kill the boss before we hear it.

1392
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:09,619
Come on.

1393
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:15,409
I...

1394
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:18,630
This game ran like shit.

1395
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,630
Yeah, it did.

1396
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:23,640
It's not even going to play the music.

1397
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,439
Fuck it.

1398
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:28,439
Whatever.

1399
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:40,409
Micolash, this fight was an F, but his funny voice lines make it like a C. You chase him

1400
01:22:40,409 --> 01:22:51,939
around this mist area, and he goes like, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1401
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:52,939
Yeah, this was...

1402
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:55,779
I hated this.

1403
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:59,340
Those of you who were asking if this changes, no, this is the whole fight.

1404
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:04,050
You just follow this guy around a maze, and he laughs at you and says, yeah, this fight

1405
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:12,670
is like a D. You can't put this higher than C because this is the fight.

1406
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:15,199
You're watching the whole thing.

1407
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,979
You just run behind this guy like a fucking recess.

1408
01:23:17,979 --> 01:23:20,789
You're like tag.

1409
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:22,670
And sometimes shit just gets in the way.

1410
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:26,279
No.

1411
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,800
Look at how long this one is.

1412
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,470
The longest one.

1413
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:46,979
Ooh, Mergo's Wet Nurse was cool because the music was creepy.

1414
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:51,300
I liked it.

1415
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:57,229
That fight is F. Stop the blood-borne bias.

1416
01:23:57,229 --> 01:24:03,020
That's true.

1417
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,020
This thing was creepy.

1418
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,020
I liked it.

1419
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,810
Okay, yeah, I know where that goes.

1420
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:14,739
Undead Giant?

1421
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:15,739
What is this fight?

1422
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:20,180
I didn't do this one.

1423
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,180
Merciless Chieftain?

1424
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:24,340
Who is Merciless Chieftain?

1425
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:30,430
Ah, these are from the Chalice Dungeons, okay.

1426
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:35,670
I didn't do any of these.

1427
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,069
Watchdog of the Old Lords, another Chalice Dungeon.

1428
01:24:38,069 --> 01:24:40,340
Eh.

1429
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,750
Eh, I didn't play it.

1430
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,920
Yeah, I didn't do it.

1431
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,920
Eh.

1432
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
Eh.

1433
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
Eh.

1434
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Eh.

1435
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,920
Eh.

1436
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,920
No.

1437
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,609
No.

1438
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:55,000
No.

1439
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,029
No?

1440
01:24:58,029 --> 01:25:01,470
I skipped over the Chalice Dungeons stuff.

1441
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:11,220
It's kind of funny, they turned the Chalice Dungeons into the dungeons in Blood Elden Ring.

1442
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,220
Very similar.

1443
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:13,220
Almost the exact same setup.

1444
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,029
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1445
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:20,479
Wow, I skipped almost all of this.

1446
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:22,779
Alright, okay.

1447
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:29,020
It's time for you to see the re- It's time for you to see.

1448
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:33,770
This is the best boss that From Software has ever made.

1449
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:43,199
Without a single doubt, by far.

1450
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:55,890
Bloodborne also has the best DLC in many of the games as well.

1451
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:56,890
Actual fake fan?

1452
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:59,090
I did some of them, I just don't remember them.

1453
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:04,939
So, if I remember, this boss is fucking dumb.

1454
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:11,300
Boy, it's just like, you've given this, uh, in Dark Souls 1 bosses like this, in Demon

1455
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:15,140
Souls bosses like this, you gave this like a B, like a C or a D.

1456
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,439
I'm sorry.

1457
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:19,439
You're gonna have to, you're gonna have to wait a second.

1458
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:26,670
You're gonna have to wait a second.

1459
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:33,569
Okay, now we'll watch.

1460
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,260
Turn it up.

1461
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:41,479
Wow, you're fighting this like beast and he's scary and he's fucked up.

1462
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:43,159
Pretty cool.

1463
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:44,439
What's happening?

1464
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:45,439
What's going on here?

1465
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:56,409
Shh.

1466
01:26:56,409 --> 01:27:19,750
Quiet, we're watching.

1467
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,750
What's happening?

1468
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:32,590
There he is.

1469
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Now the real fight begins.

1470
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:56,659
Why, why, why, Bat Chest, what?

1471
01:27:56,659 --> 01:28:17,060
You guys are all haters and that's fine.

1472
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:21,180
That's fine, you can be a hater, that's the best, this is the best encounter that From

1473
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:26,140
Software has ever made and I'm gonna tell you, Horror Lou is close.

1474
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:33,090
It's gonna be, I'm gonna need some Jeopardy music because, I don't know, that's the coolest

1475
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,579
fight in the fucking entire game.

1476
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:43,079
Not only in the whole game, in the whole franchises that they've ever had.

1477
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:44,449
Bat Chest.

1478
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,970
And I'll tell you, immediately following this boss is one of the worst bosses that

1479
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:48,970
they put in the DLC.

1480
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:53,920
Sorry, I just, hopefully I didn't hurt your ears.

1481
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:59,000
Uh, Lawrence is just Cleric Beast on fire, we've seen them use this technique before.

1482
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,239
And this fight was dumb.

1483
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:08,010
Just Cleric Beast that is on fire.

1484
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:15,600
We've seen them do this a few times.

1485
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,090
There's a Ludwig Funko pop.

1486
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:28,699
And I, you know, that sound, it's kind of overdone.

1487
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:30,739
Living Failures, this is bad too.

1488
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:38,470
This is the same fight from, yeah, this is really bad too.

1489
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:43,659
I heckin' love Lud, yeah, I heckin' love Ludwig.

1490
01:29:43,659 --> 01:29:48,420
That's fine.

1491
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,539
This is so bad.

1492
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:56,539
It's so unfortunate because this area is one of the coolest DLC areas of any From Software

1493
01:29:56,539 --> 01:29:57,850
game.

1494
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:05,229
But the boss at the end of it is dogshit.

1495
01:30:05,229 --> 01:30:11,000
Now we're getting into the Riddiel shit here.

1496
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Hard equals bad?

1497
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,350
No, just putting like, just small enemies that just spawn over and over again, you know,

1498
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,350
I don't know.

1499
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:21,029
Just place around just enemies and kill them, like deacons.

1500
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:28,390
I don't like the deacon fight either, I thought it was horrible.

1501
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,710
This fight was crazy as well.

1502
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:43,770
Not only that, this was a, I believe a three-phase fight.

1503
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:56,520
Lady Maria was, I'm gonna say it, probably the, mmm, did you just say, did you say bootleg

1504
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,939
millennia?

1505
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:02,619
No, I'm sorry, this is actually a good encounter.

1506
01:31:02,619 --> 01:31:10,090
This is actually a really cool encounter and a really fun encounter.

1507
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,710
This is high up there.

1508
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:17,550
The only reason why I don't know if I want to put this at S is because the, it's, it's

1509
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:24,600
just a long fight and the second, the second phase and third phase, whatever, um, it just

1510
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,039
takes a long time to get there.

1511
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:31,319
It's millennia with a gun.

1512
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,130
Oh, it is not?

1513
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:43,239
It's not bootleg millennia!

1514
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:44,520
Maria came first!

1515
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:53,300
Don't you understand?

1516
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,779
Check this out.

1517
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:58,859
Oh, no, no, no, now you fucked up.

1518
01:31:58,859 --> 01:32:05,279
Now you got to phase three.

1519
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:07,680
What makes millennia bad other than that she's hard?

1520
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:19,789
The waterfall dance is the stupidest move in any game they've ever made.

1521
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:20,789
Just dodge it?

1522
01:32:20,789 --> 01:32:21,789
I don't care.

1523
01:32:21,789 --> 01:32:22,789
I don't care.

1524
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:29,079
I don't like it.

1525
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:30,079
Yeah.

1526
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:31,079
This is now, this is a fight if I've ever seen one.

1527
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:33,989
All right.

1528
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,640
We all know where that is.

1529
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,640
Orphan.

1530
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:41,439
Oh yeah.

1531
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:42,439
Orphan.

1532
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:43,439
Orphan's design is, I don't know.

1533
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:52,750
He kind of looks like one of the nobles in Elden Ring with like a big sack.

1534
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:56,520
This fight was so hard, but he just screams.

1535
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:11,430
Yeah, he just loves cartoons like Tom and Jerry screams.

1536
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:19,239
I'm gonna put it at B. I don't think it's S.

1537
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:25,699
Yeah.

1538
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:39,229
That sounds like you.

1539
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:41,399
No, it doesn't.

1540
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:54,100
I'm not going to do this great.

1541
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,100
All right.

1542
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,920
We know what this is.

1543
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,920
These are huge like spoilers, guys.

1544
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,409
Like if you haven't played these games, what are you doing here?

1545
01:34:04,409 --> 01:34:07,380
Garamond's fight is awesome.

1546
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:21,250
In fact, Garamond might actually be S. Garamond I think actually is S.

1547
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:27,109
This fight felt, I remember, I remember when doing this and being like, yo, this is really,

1548
01:34:27,109 --> 01:34:28,609
this is really happening right now.

1549
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:34,050
It was just like, holy shit.

1550
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,649
I am playing Bloodborne right now.

1551
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:36,649
This is happening.

1552
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:47,300
Yeah.

1553
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,300
This was so cool.

1554
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:53,470
And then when he goes, I mean, my bitrate is probably awful right now, but the scythe

1555
01:34:53,470 --> 01:35:01,250
is, he's got a gun, play the cut scene.

1556
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,560
I don't want to spoil the whole game.

1557
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,560
There's tons of people that didn't play this.

1558
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,560
It's only on PS4.

1559
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:09,460
What a shame.

1560
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,460
Okay.

1561
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,380
So this is the actual major spoiler coming up.

1562
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,659
I mean, like absolute true major spoiler.

1563
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:20,100
This is like literally the final end of the whole game, like just to let you know.

1564
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:30,350
The moon presence, which I thought was all right.

1565
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:36,119
I didn't love it.

1566
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:47,670
I can't say I particularly enjoyed this that much.

1567
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:48,670
Cooler than Ludwig?

1568
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,670
No, I don't think so.

1569
01:35:50,670 --> 01:36:02,750
It's ultra mid mega C. Yeah.

1570
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,750
It's a lot.

1571
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,310
That's a lot of this.

1572
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:07,270
It's a big dash that moon presence does.

1573
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,270
That's really annoying.

1574
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:11,239
It's not Garamond.

1575
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:12,239
All right.

1576
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,949
I think I'm ready.

1577
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:17,989
I believe I'm ready to do to place all the Bloodborne characters.

1578
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:24,420
Some of these are going to shock you.

1579
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:30,619
Some of these are going to shock you.

1580
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:40,270
Blood Starved Beast is a C. Blood Starved Beast is better than Tibia Mariner.

1581
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:43,659
I don't think it's better than the old hero or Nito.

1582
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:51,729
Nito is the kind of C plus for me.

1583
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:53,289
Micolash, Host of the Nightmare.

1584
01:36:53,289 --> 01:36:58,550
This is D. I mean, it's F. So let's go ahead and put it there the way that we're, we've

1585
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:03,039
got to do this for real.

1586
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:04,039
Characters cool.

1587
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:07,500
The fight is just annoying.

1588
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,699
It's voice lines are cool, but I'll look.

1589
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:11,899
Is it better than the one reborn?

1590
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:16,079
I don't think it is.

1591
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:17,359
Is it better than Pinwheel?

1592
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:20,619
Pinwheel actually probably should be here.

1593
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:24,909
It's better than Pinwheel.

1594
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:25,909
Is it though?

1595
01:37:25,909 --> 01:37:32,289
Because at least with Pinwheel you get Pinwheel over with very quickly.

1596
01:37:32,289 --> 01:37:34,170
Micolash takes a long time.

1597
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:37,100
You just chase him around.

1598
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:46,500
You get it over with.

1599
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,529
Um, I cannot place Mergo's Wet Nurse yet.

1600
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:51,569
I can place Amigdala.

1601
01:37:51,569 --> 01:38:02,060
This is a C. Martyr Lugarius is, I don't think it's A. I think it's B somewhere, but I'll

1602
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,970
get it right.

1603
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:12,260
Airman is A. I don't know if it...

1604
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:15,619
Let me get it in the right spot before anybody freaks out.

1605
01:38:15,619 --> 01:38:23,600
Moon Presence, Super Ultra Omega C.

1606
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:34,390
Living Failures, F. Are they better than, uh, no.

1607
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:39,699
The Witches of Hemwick, this is a D. Although it maybe should, I don't know, how many Bloodborne

1608
01:38:39,699 --> 01:38:40,699
bosses are bad?

1609
01:38:40,699 --> 01:38:43,539
Alright, Lady Maria.

1610
01:38:43,539 --> 01:39:02,699
Lady Maria is coming up to A. Um, Lawrence, high D. Where's Cleric Beast?

1611
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:05,500
They both, I mean they're both the same exact thing.

1612
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,500
They're fine.

1613
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,920
Orphan?

1614
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:18,319
I don't know, I'm gonna be honest with you, the final boss of Bloodborne, being just kind

1615
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:24,199
of like a naked guy screaming, it was like, I get it, I understand the lore, I understand,

1616
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:25,949
I get it.

1617
01:39:25,949 --> 01:39:36,720
But I don't think it was, I don't think so.

1618
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:47,189
I have to consciously put this higher than the Flame Lurk, than Gwyn.

1619
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:52,770
I mean, was it, probably what, Gwyn maybe shouldn't be this high.

1620
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:57,039
It's not, it's not better than Lugarius, I had more fun with Lugarius.

1621
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:04,930
I'm gonna keep it there for now.

1622
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:19,899
Something that's high, from C. Alright, Vicar Emilia, I'm gonna say B.

1623
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:27,020
Celestial Emissary, somewhere down in F, or D, whatever, it's just, no.

1624
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:31,920
Virgo's Wet Nurse, I'm gonna go low B for now.

1625
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:44,390
Arl, C. Shadows of Yharnam, high C. I did not do these ones, so we're gonna put them here.

1626
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:48,750
I know, dude, your favorite game, your favorite game is Bloodborne, and you have not done

1627
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:52,300
any of these.

1628
01:40:52,300 --> 01:41:03,939
I didn't, none of them.

1629
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:27,739
Okay, that's my favorite game ever made, and I didn't do any of these.

1630
01:41:27,739 --> 01:41:31,220
They were hidden deep in all these Chalice Dungeons, I just, I didn't really like the

1631
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:35,270
Chalice Dungeons.

1632
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:45,420
Okay, we are getting there, we're getting there.

1633
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:52,260
Let's go ahead and get these out of the way, because all the Elden Ring ones are in memory.

1634
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:58,520
So let's get the Bloodborne stuff in the right place, and then we'll do Elden Ring.

1635
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:11,279
Alright, Father Gascoigne, A+, Rodrik, yep, Maria, I think that's fine where it is, although

1636
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:12,279
I think they're better than these.

1637
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:19,800
I gotta knock down Sif a little bit here.

1638
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,390
Orphan, Legarius was cooler than all these.

1639
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:28,880
What a great game.

1640
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:38,310
Ah, alright, so Legarius, better than Ornstein and Smog, Koss was, I mean, Old King, I mean,

1641
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:47,340
I don't know, Caping Dragon, better than that, Flamelurker.

1642
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:48,819
Did you play the game?

1643
01:42:48,819 --> 01:42:50,859
That's one of my favorite games of all time!

1644
01:42:50,859 --> 01:43:04,420
Well, I didn't do the extra side dungeons, that doesn't matter.

1645
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:10,140
Oh, guess what, I think Super Mario 64 is one of my favorite games.

1646
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,380
I didn't ever get 120 stars, I got like 80!

1647
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:20,689
Do I need to get everything?

1648
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:24,710
You missed half the bosses, I didn't miss half the bosses!

1649
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:29,069
Alright, I think this is fine where it is.

1650
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:33,810
I actually don't think this is better than this.

1651
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:38,789
I think Gascoigne was better than Garamond because, I don't know, I thought, Gascoigne

1652
01:43:38,789 --> 01:43:53,020
is like one of my favorite characters in that game, you're a fraud.

1653
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:57,699
I didn't do any of this, the challenge dungeons were confusing, I just played the game.

1654
01:43:57,699 --> 01:43:59,300
I beat this game, okay.

1655
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:05,420
I beat Bloodborne, god, like probably ten times, and I never did any of the Chalice

1656
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:10,819
dungeons.

1657
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:17,060
They were annoying, it was like, they were all the same, they were all the same, dungeon

1658
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:24,979
just randomized, I didn't like it, I didn't want to do it.

1659
01:44:24,979 --> 01:44:26,729
But it's fine.

1660
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:31,939
Okay.

1661
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:32,939
Moon, okay.

1662
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:37,590
Shadows of Yharnam, Wetners, I think this is fine up here.

1663
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:44,359
Blood Starve Beast, definitely not cooler than the Tibia Mariner, or definitely better

1664
01:44:44,359 --> 01:44:50,319
than the Valgar Goyles, because like, those things are stupid.

1665
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:51,319
Horus Demon as well.

1666
01:44:51,319 --> 01:45:02,770
A lot of Cs all in a row here.

1667
01:45:02,770 --> 01:45:06,170
I think Omigdala is better than, I don't think it's cooler than Seath.

1668
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:08,979
At least Seath looked kind of weird.

1669
01:45:08,979 --> 01:45:10,619
Moon Presence was probably better than this.

1670
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:12,560
Yeah, these all have to come up.

1671
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:22,550
Like, Penetrator is just a guy with a sword, it's not like a huge deal.

1672
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:40,340
Hmm, these are F.

1673
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:44,260
Micolash is probably the worst of the four, just because I just, chasing him around was

1674
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:46,140
annoying.

1675
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,819
Why the fuck is the Tibia Mariner above the Moon Presence?

1676
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:50,579
I'm working on this, okay?

1677
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:53,199
This is, I'm working on it.

1678
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:54,199
I need to make sure.

1679
01:45:54,199 --> 01:45:57,949
There's a lot of creatures here.

1680
01:45:57,949 --> 01:46:03,819
The Tibia Mariner is cooler.

1681
01:46:03,819 --> 01:46:04,939
I think so.

1682
01:46:04,939 --> 01:46:14,340
I think the Tibia Mariner is cooler than the Moonlight Butterfly.

1683
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:20,289
The Moon Presence is just, yeah, the Moon Presence is cooler than the, yeah, that's

1684
01:46:20,289 --> 01:46:22,039
true.

1685
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:23,039
Yeah.

1686
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:24,039
I don't think, I think this is the wall.

1687
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:25,979
This is the wall.

1688
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:30,979
To graduate to C+, you have to be cooler than the Tibia Mariner, which seems like apparently

1689
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:32,300
a pretty big feat.

1690
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,899
This is the wall.

1691
01:46:35,899 --> 01:46:37,779
You have to be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.

1692
01:46:37,779 --> 01:46:45,170
Or, excuse me, you're not getting any exclusive C++.

1693
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:51,430
Is the Moon Presence cooler than the Tibia Mariner?

1694
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:53,630
Fight-wise, mechanics-wise, looks-wise?

1695
01:46:53,630 --> 01:47:00,060
No.

1696
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:09,000
Are any of these motherfuckers cooler than the Tibia Mariner?

1697
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:15,539
Shit, somebody might be, hold on.

1698
01:47:15,539 --> 01:47:17,770
I gotta make sure I get this right.

1699
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:20,210
Rom might be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.

1700
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:29,649
Do you know what I mean?

1701
01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:35,869
I think we, I think Rom graduates.

1702
01:47:35,869 --> 01:47:40,579
Quelaag might be cooler than the Tibia Mariner.

1703
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:45,699
Absolutely no way the Taurus Demon, Bell Gargoyle, Butterfly, Seath is definitely cooler than

1704
01:47:45,699 --> 01:47:52,380
all these though.

1705
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,779
Alright, very important.

1706
01:47:55,779 --> 01:48:04,899
Is Seath the Scaleless cooler than the Tibia Mariner?

1707
01:48:04,899 --> 01:48:08,500
Yes.

1708
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:14,579
Alright, I think we're good.

1709
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:16,079
One Reborn at least is a fight.

1710
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:20,939
This is going up here, Pat, I mean, this is just, there's stuff that I don't want to put

1711
01:48:20,939 --> 01:48:24,460
in F because I don't want to have F be crowded, because I want to at least pretend like I

1712
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,069
like these games.

1713
01:48:26,069 --> 01:48:34,579
So I can't just put all these things in F. I don't think this belongs down here.

1714
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:40,600
This is definitely cooler than this.

1715
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,710
Capra Deep, what's the worst thing?

1716
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:46,210
Dirty Colossus is not the worst thing.

1717
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:51,590
Dead of Chaos is probably the worst.

1718
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:57,369
And I gotta be honest, so is the Celestial Emissary is not even a boss fight.

1719
01:48:57,369 --> 01:49:05,420
You fight like three dozen of those little like bug alien people and then it ends.

1720
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:14,430
This actually could be the worst.

1721
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:17,470
Dirty Colossus is just, it's not bad, it's just boring.

1722
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,239
Living Failures belongs down here too.

1723
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,239
I didn't like these at all, they were terrible.

1724
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:49,810
I'm trying to get it right.

1725
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:59,579
Capra Demon is probably the coolest out of all of these.

1726
01:49:59,579 --> 01:50:02,659
I think this is accurate.

1727
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:03,779
I think I got it.

1728
01:50:03,779 --> 01:50:08,819
Dirty Colossus should be in, no, not F, right?

1729
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:16,720
If I'm going to put Dirty Colossus in F, then all the Asylum Demons have to be in F.

1730
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:20,680
Same thing with the Maneater.

1731
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:26,319
Dirty Colossus is going up and so is Maneater.

1732
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:35,939
And we're going to bring all these Asylum Demons down.

1733
01:50:35,939 --> 01:50:37,659
This is looking a lot better.

1734
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:44,800
Way better than it was before.

1735
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,880
Centipede Demon is definitely cooler than this.

1736
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,899
Just put the two bugs next to each other, who cares?

1737
01:50:50,899 --> 01:50:52,340
Iron Golem is going down here too.

1738
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:53,340
Who cares?

1739
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:59,470
You're at least a fight, this goes here.

1740
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:02,880
You're at least a fight, you go there.

1741
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:03,880
This is hard.

1742
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:13,890
I think I'm good for Bloodborne.

1743
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:16,810
I don't know if I want to put any of these at S.

1744
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:20,449
I have to reliably say that was one of the coolest, that was awesome.

1745
01:51:20,449 --> 01:51:21,449
That was unbelievable.

1746
01:51:21,449 --> 01:51:39,569
I'm going to leave it for now.

1747
01:51:39,569 --> 01:51:43,270
I think I like Godric more than Maria.

1748
01:51:43,310 --> 01:51:48,369
I like Godric more than Gascoigne.

1749
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:49,369
Oh shit, no I don't.

1750
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,369
That's recency bias.

1751
01:51:50,369 --> 01:51:56,329
Alright, let's do Elden Ring, because I can do these quick.

1752
01:51:56,329 --> 01:52:00,100
Elden Ring, I can do it really quick.

1753
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,810
Here we go.

1754
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:03,810
Uh, Mog.

1755
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:08,539
We just did it, I don't need any refreshers.

1756
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:16,729
Mog is going to be up at C, or B, for now.

1757
01:52:16,729 --> 01:52:22,689
Probably here.

1758
01:52:22,689 --> 01:52:25,489
Wait, is Mog cooler than the Tibia Mariner?

1759
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:32,270
Yes, absolutely.

1760
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:36,829
Mimic Tear, it's a comedy boss, so it's just going in D.

1761
01:52:36,869 --> 01:52:41,489
I don't think it's F, it means it's close.

1762
01:52:41,489 --> 01:52:50,029
Also, Rikard, okay, Rikard was a gimmick fight, but was a really cool design boss, it's going

1763
01:52:50,029 --> 01:52:52,039
to go B.

1764
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:53,039
Do we need some music or something?

1765
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:58,579
Uh, yeah, we can put something on.

1766
01:52:58,579 --> 01:53:00,779
D, I'm just getting him in the general area.

1767
01:53:00,779 --> 01:53:04,270
This is not, we're not done completely, hold on.

1768
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:07,430
It's got to be in the general area.

1769
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:08,550
I can hear myself breathing.

1770
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:09,550
I'm working on it.

1771
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:21,050
How about, um, it's a good OST.

1772
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:22,050
Bugsnax?

1773
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:25,529
No, it doesn't fit.

1774
01:53:25,529 --> 01:53:26,529
Mario 64, yeah sure.

1775
01:53:26,529 --> 01:53:29,050
No, that doesn't fit either.

1776
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:33,250
That's going to annoy me, I know it will.

1777
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,130
Halo?

1778
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:42,380
Hmm, Hollow Knight.

1779
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,380
Yeah, that sounds fun.

1780
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:56,079
Okay, because we're not watching any Elden Ring stuff.

1781
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:05,060
There you go, now we can not freak out.

1782
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:10,659
So, uh, Godskin Noble, that's the fat one, right, or is that the skinny one?

1783
01:54:10,659 --> 01:54:20,590
Fat?

1784
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:21,590
I actually like that a lot.

1785
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,899
That was a cool fight.

1786
01:54:22,899 --> 01:54:25,899
But, I don't know, I kind of, they used it too much.

1787
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:32,020
Don't you feel like it was kind of used a little too much?

1788
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:38,819
I'm going to put it down to C just because I feel like they used this too much.

1789
01:54:38,819 --> 01:54:40,979
This character appears in the game like four times.

1790
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:44,520
Three times?

1791
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,520
Yeah, but I mean, it's like, I don't know, I feel like there wasn't too many places.

1792
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:55,250
I'm going to keep it here for now.

1793
01:54:55,250 --> 01:55:01,739
Um, actually, I could probably do some of the Sekiro ones too, get off of memory.

1794
01:55:01,739 --> 01:55:07,449
Alright, we got Elder Dragon Grail.

1795
01:55:07,449 --> 01:55:11,390
This is the one that you just put a bleed weapon on and kill it, right?

1796
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:12,550
It doesn't really attack back?

1797
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:15,750
I mean, is this really a boss?

1798
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:27,449
Or is this just kind of like a set piece that dies?

1799
01:55:27,449 --> 01:55:28,449
Eh, eh.

1800
01:55:28,449 --> 01:55:30,069
Yeah.

1801
01:55:30,069 --> 01:55:31,760
It's F.

1802
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,359
F, but no, I don't think it deserves to be an F.

1803
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:37,710
Or Dan?

1804
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:44,380
F?

1805
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:48,470
Uh, Regal Ancestor Spirit, I like that a lot.

1806
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:49,470
That was a lot of fun.

1807
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:54,000
It's going to be for now.

1808
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:00,289
Uh, we've got the gargoyles, which I feel like I would have been kind of, I'm going

1809
01:56:00,289 --> 01:56:02,460
to make a statement here.

1810
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:07,060
All the, it's two enemies in the same room boss.

1811
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:11,310
Those are all at least a C or lower.

1812
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:12,550
They just are.

1813
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:18,329
Like, we just put two in the room.

1814
01:56:18,329 --> 01:56:20,210
Eh.

1815
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:27,140
Uh, Dragonkin Soldier of Noxtela, did I do this?

1816
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:29,140
Oh, and these are the dragon soldiers.

1817
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:34,270
They kind of overused these two, but they were interesting.

1818
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:38,260
C.

1819
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,260
B is champions.

1820
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:48,630
These were bad.

1821
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:54,329
Alright, this is, this is the Godfrey Shade, which is probably somewhere in the high sea.

1822
01:56:54,329 --> 01:56:55,329
Maybe not.

1823
01:56:55,329 --> 01:57:00,000
I got to, that's going to take a lot of looking.

1824
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,970
Okay, Astel, Natural Born of the Void, this, I liked this one a lot.

1825
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:06,970
Astel's going up to at least high B.

1826
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:07,970
We'll, we'll sort it.

1827
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:09,909
We'll sort it.

1828
01:57:09,909 --> 01:57:13,909
Some of these have to get, you have to graduate these to A, you don't just put it in A, unless

1829
01:57:13,909 --> 01:57:16,369
you're certain.

1830
01:57:16,369 --> 01:57:17,609
Margit.

1831
01:57:17,609 --> 01:57:22,039
Margit and Morgoth are going to be next to each other, because they're the same person.

1832
01:57:22,039 --> 01:57:25,300
If one fights, it's a lot harder.

1833
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:32,619
Margit.

1834
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:33,619
It wasn't that, it was alright, it was okay.

1835
01:57:33,619 --> 01:57:41,479
I think it's like a B.

1836
01:57:41,479 --> 01:57:43,909
And Morgoth, it's kind of unfortunate.

1837
01:57:43,909 --> 01:57:46,470
I'm going to have to put this down here.

1838
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:49,470
Morgoth goes down and I don't know, because I didn't kill him.

1839
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:53,710
I summoned the Mimic Tear before the nerf and it killed him in less than 15 seconds.

1840
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:55,710
I don't even know what that guy does.

1841
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:59,210
I have no idea what Morgoth's moves are.

1842
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:01,210
Mimic Tear killed him in 10 seconds.

1843
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:05,770
And it was at that moment that I said, I'm not going to use the Mimic Tear again, unless

1844
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:07,579
I need to.

1845
01:58:07,579 --> 01:58:11,579
I got one attempt in, but I didn't really even fight this boss.

1846
01:58:11,579 --> 01:58:18,970
Commander Nihil.

1847
01:58:18,970 --> 01:58:29,819
Commander Nihil was the one with the summons, with the electronic lightning prosthetic,

1848
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:32,979
right?

1849
01:58:32,979 --> 01:58:37,489
I don't know.

1850
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:38,489
Bulled and Margit?

1851
01:58:38,489 --> 01:58:40,239
Maybe.

1852
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:43,239
But the Ancestral Spirit I thought was a really cool fight.

1853
01:58:43,239 --> 01:58:44,539
It'll be here for now.

1854
01:58:44,539 --> 01:58:46,619
Why is Rodan so low?

1855
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:47,619
I hated that fight.

1856
01:58:47,619 --> 01:58:48,619
It was stupid.

1857
01:58:48,619 --> 01:58:50,750
I don't like it.

1858
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,750
I don't like it at all.

1859
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,750
It was one of the worst.

1860
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:57,529
This one was cool too, but then they started using this as a regular enemy and it kind

1861
01:58:57,529 --> 01:59:00,149
of took the magic away from me.

1862
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:03,989
But I would say at least like a B-.

1863
01:59:03,989 --> 01:59:08,180
Borey.

1864
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:09,180
Okay, these are dragons.

1865
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:10,180
We'll leave the dragons for now.

1866
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,180
Fire Giant.

1867
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:16,659
I would have loved to have been able to see the Fire Giant, but it actually was a pretty

1868
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:17,659
cool fight.

1869
01:59:17,659 --> 01:59:19,659
Especially the cutscene and then the second phase.

1870
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:22,920
It's going to stay here for now.

1871
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,420
Hard equals bad.

1872
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,489
Wait, when did they say that?

1873
01:59:27,489 --> 01:59:32,250
What are you talking about?

1874
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:37,899
All right, which one of these down here is hard?

1875
01:59:37,899 --> 01:59:38,899
Let me tell you.

1876
01:59:38,899 --> 01:59:43,439
This fight you can kill in one hit if you really want to.

1877
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:44,439
This is not hard.

1878
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:45,810
This is not hard.

1879
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:46,810
This is a gimmick.

1880
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,810
This is a gimmick.

1881
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:48,810
This is a gimmick.

1882
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:49,810
This is a gimmick.

1883
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:50,810
This is a gimmick.

1884
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:51,810
This is a gimmick.

1885
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,500
This is a gimmick.

1886
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,500
This is a gimmick.

1887
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:55,500
This is a gimmick.

1888
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,500
This is a gimmick.

1889
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,060
These are tutorial fights.

1890
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,739
And this is a gimmick.

1891
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:02,739
How are these hard?

1892
02:00:02,739 --> 02:00:05,750
Oh, you're talking specifically to Rodan.

1893
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:11,920
Rodan is staying at F. Rodan, that's not a hard fight.

1894
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:20,619
It's a dumb fight.

1895
02:00:20,619 --> 02:00:25,359
And that was pre-nerf, which was even worse.

1896
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:33,359
And let's make everybody angry just because they'll get out of the way.

1897
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:34,359
Mog, Lord of Blood.

1898
02:00:34,359 --> 02:00:35,359
Wait, didn't I already put Mog?

1899
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:39,100
Where's Mog?

1900
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:48,460
Didn't I put Mog?

1901
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:52,329
Mog?

1902
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:53,329
Mog the Omen.

1903
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:54,630
Mog.

1904
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:55,630
All right, well, whatever.

1905
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:56,630
It's the same thing.

1906
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:59,380
We never fought the other one.

1907
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,260
Oh, whatever.

1908
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,260
It's just in the same place then.

1909
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:06,739
Gold skin duo.

1910
02:01:06,739 --> 02:01:10,109
I mean, all right.

1911
02:01:10,109 --> 02:01:12,760
C-.

1912
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:17,409
Dragon Lord, Placidusix.

1913
02:01:17,409 --> 02:01:20,859
Dragon Lord, Placidusix is very high.

1914
02:01:20,859 --> 02:01:27,939
I think we've got our first A, at least, besides Godric.

1915
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:31,930
Yeah.

1916
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:34,170
Dragon Lord and Godric are pretty close.

1917
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:35,170
I think Dragon Lord is cooler, though.

1918
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,109
Dragon Lord is cooler than Gaspine.

1919
02:01:38,109 --> 02:01:55,710
I have to be fair.

1920
02:01:55,710 --> 02:02:02,579
Nope.

1921
02:02:02,579 --> 02:02:03,579
Rinala.

1922
02:02:03,579 --> 02:02:11,220
Rinala was like C, C-plus, maybe.

1923
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:13,460
Better than that.

1924
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:21,720
It was just kind of the magic spam fight, right?

1925
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:22,720
All right.

1926
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:26,460
Malekith.

1927
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:29,760
Malekith was not, I don't know.

1928
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,319
I feel like, did I have a lot of complaints about Malekith?

1929
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:36,289
I think I did.

1930
02:02:36,289 --> 02:02:37,289
I love that clergyman.

1931
02:02:37,289 --> 02:02:38,289
I love that beast clergyman.

1932
02:02:38,289 --> 02:02:39,289
Really cool design.

1933
02:02:39,289 --> 02:02:41,289
We're going to use that part.

1934
02:02:41,289 --> 02:02:49,539
Design-wise, really cool.

1935
02:02:49,539 --> 02:02:53,699
I think it's a good spot for it for now.

1936
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:54,699
Oh, Gideon.

1937
02:02:54,699 --> 02:03:00,949
I'll be all knowing, of course.

1938
02:03:00,949 --> 02:03:03,199
D.

1939
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:04,199
Maybe D-plus.

1940
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:12,329
That's better than the Four Kings.

1941
02:03:12,329 --> 02:03:13,329
Leone, Misbegotten.

1942
02:03:13,329 --> 02:03:18,079
These are the kind of lion, wolf, people with the sword.

1943
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:21,109
They weren't bad.

1944
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:23,109
They were, I mean, they were used a lot.

1945
02:03:23,109 --> 02:03:25,109
Kind of like, I would put it in the same categories.

1946
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:29,109
I'm going to put high C, low B.

1947
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:34,539
The bosses that they just kind of made regular enemies like five times.

1948
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:38,899
I think that is fair.

1949
02:03:38,899 --> 02:03:43,460
These might come down.

1950
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:48,899
Gideon deserves better.

1951
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:49,899
We'll see.

1952
02:03:49,899 --> 02:03:50,899
Hold on.

1953
02:03:50,899 --> 02:03:54,170
It's above comparing to the other games.

1954
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:55,170
Loretta?

1955
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:58,819
This is going to surprise a lot of you guys.

1956
02:03:58,819 --> 02:04:08,289
I may have just gotten like 10 unsubscriptions in a row.

1957
02:04:08,289 --> 02:04:09,289
I really liked that fight.

1958
02:04:09,289 --> 02:04:10,289
I thought it was really cool.

1959
02:04:10,289 --> 02:04:18,329
That fight didn't feel annoying.

1960
02:04:18,329 --> 02:04:20,949
It was kind of challenging.

1961
02:04:20,949 --> 02:04:22,949
The dodging the magic and the spear with the horse.

1962
02:04:22,949 --> 02:04:23,949
You can't get on the horse.

1963
02:04:23,949 --> 02:04:25,449
I liked it a lot.

1964
02:04:25,449 --> 02:04:32,810
What music is playing?

1965
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,689
Don't tell me what this is.

1966
02:04:34,689 --> 02:04:35,689
I forgot what the OST is.

1967
02:04:35,689 --> 02:04:42,500
Don't tell me.

1968
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:48,090
Hollow Knight.

1969
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:55,729
Um, we got Ancient Hero of Zamor.

1970
02:04:55,729 --> 02:04:59,819
Oh, some of these are the jail.

1971
02:04:59,819 --> 02:05:00,819
Deathbird.

1972
02:05:00,819 --> 02:05:01,819
Oh yeah, I remember that.

1973
02:05:01,819 --> 02:05:02,819
I hated that.

1974
02:05:02,819 --> 02:05:05,579
Soldier of Godric?

1975
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:06,579
Just a regular enemy?

1976
02:05:06,579 --> 02:05:12,439
Why is it Soldier of Godric?

1977
02:05:12,439 --> 02:05:18,739
Deathbird.

1978
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:22,000
Put the death magic on the ground.

1979
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
This is a D.

1980
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,939
Melania.

1981
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:31,939
Blade of Micola.

1982
02:05:31,939 --> 02:05:39,279
Worse than Soldier of Godric.

1983
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:41,279
Radagon and Eldenbeast together.

1984
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:45,029
This is a mid-C.

1985
02:05:45,029 --> 02:05:47,359
Gave you my reasoning.

1986
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:54,079
Oh, Scream is dying again.

1987
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:58,199
Interesting.

1988
02:05:58,199 --> 02:06:01,100
Very interesting.

1989
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:04,649
I don't get it.

1990
02:06:04,649 --> 02:06:06,590
That makes sense.

1991
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:12,930
Like, um, I don't get it.

1992
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:19,329
My internet's fine.

1993
02:06:19,329 --> 02:07:47,399
Why?

1994
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:48,399
So as I was saying.

1995
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:54,500
I just like almost swallowed it and choked.

1996
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,500
Melania is F.

1997
02:07:56,500 --> 02:08:03,100
This reminds me of the Cox days.

1998
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:04,100
Here's the thing though.

1999
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:09,100
If I run a speed test right now, it'll be 1,000, 1,000.

2000
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:20,229
I could go watch like a 4K movie while the stream is dying.

2001
02:08:20,229 --> 02:08:21,229
It's not my internet.

2002
02:08:21,229 --> 02:08:23,229
It's not, it's not the internet.

2003
02:08:23,229 --> 02:08:27,229
It's some, the connection that this internet.

2004
02:08:27,229 --> 02:08:29,229
But I have two Twitch's servers.

2005
02:08:29,229 --> 02:08:31,600
Sometimes it just gets fucked.

2006
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,600
Just gets fucked up.

2007
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:39,229
While that was happening, I, I did a test.

2008
02:08:39,229 --> 02:08:41,229
While that was happening.

2009
02:08:41,229 --> 02:08:43,229
Not a single solitary problem.

2010
02:08:43,229 --> 02:08:46,229
When it was happening during the Fortnite tournament thing.

2011
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:47,229
I was in the call.

2012
02:08:47,229 --> 02:08:50,229
And they were, I had green bars on Discord.

2013
02:08:50,229 --> 02:08:51,229
Everything was normal.

2014
02:08:51,229 --> 02:08:52,600
I don't get it.

2015
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:55,949
Doesn't make any sense.

2016
02:08:55,949 --> 02:09:02,100
Speed test does not equal stability.

2017
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:05,100
Well, then I should have dropped out of the Discord call.

2018
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:09,850
I looked over here and I went, I went to zero a couple of times during that Fortnite tournament.

2019
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:10,850
And it was green bar.

2020
02:09:10,850 --> 02:09:13,850
Perfect connection on Discord and to Fortnite.

2021
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:14,850
I didn't get kicked out of Fortnite.

2022
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:15,850
I was in it the whole time.

2023
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:20,029
You know what I mean?

2024
02:09:20,029 --> 02:09:26,979
The routing issue between the ISP and Twitch.

2025
02:09:26,979 --> 02:09:35,289
It has to be.

2026
02:09:35,289 --> 02:09:37,289
There's nothing, there's like nothing I can really do.

2027
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:39,460
The only thing I can do is I can contact Twitch.

2028
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,460
And just be like.

2029
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:41,640
Yo.

2030
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:42,640
Um.

2031
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:43,640
What's happening?

2032
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:44,640
Like what?

2033
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:47,640
Can you look at my connection and see like what's going on?

2034
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:50,899
Because on my end, nothing is wrong.

2035
02:09:50,899 --> 02:09:53,899
But before, when I used to have internet problems all the time.

2036
02:09:53,899 --> 02:09:55,899
That was a me problem.

2037
02:09:55,899 --> 02:09:56,899
That was like.

2038
02:09:56,899 --> 02:09:58,899
I was dropping packets.

2039
02:09:58,899 --> 02:10:00,899
My internet browser wouldn't even open.

2040
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:06,399
The speed test would be like 0.5 up and like 0.2 down.

2041
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:09,409
So it's not this time.

2042
02:10:09,409 --> 02:10:10,409
It's not the internet this time.

2043
02:10:10,409 --> 02:10:12,409
It's something to do with the routing to Twitch.

2044
02:10:12,409 --> 02:10:14,159
Who knows?

2045
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:16,810
Anyways.

2046
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:18,810
That was a.

2047
02:10:18,810 --> 02:10:19,810
I don't think Millenia.

2048
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:21,810
Obviously let's be, I'll be fair.

2049
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:26,069
Millenia I think was somewhere up here.

2050
02:10:26,069 --> 02:10:30,489
Hard equals bad.

2051
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:39,319
Yes, hard equals bad.

2052
02:10:39,319 --> 02:10:42,319
Some of these were just kind of the little mini bosses, which I don't know if they should be on here.

2053
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:45,010
Magma worm was kind of cool.

2054
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:56,979
I actually liked that fight.

2055
02:10:56,979 --> 02:10:59,300
I'll stick with this for now.

2056
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:05,340
For now.

2057
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,340
Ancestor Spirit and Regal Ancestor Spirit.

2058
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:10,100
I'm going to put the same spot.

2059
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:12,100
Kind of the same fight.

2060
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:23,140
But the Regal one was upgraded a little bit.

2061
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:26,619
Where is it?

2062
02:11:26,619 --> 02:11:27,930
Right here.

2063
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:28,930
A Ulcerated Tree Spirit.

2064
02:11:28,930 --> 02:11:29,930
They used this a lot.

2065
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:31,930
It was cool the first few times.

2066
02:11:31,930 --> 02:11:32,930
It's not going to be F.

2067
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:37,090
It's going to be like C.

2068
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:43,489
Somewhere around with the dragonkin there.

2069
02:11:43,489 --> 02:11:44,489
Regal had the big heal.

2070
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:46,619
That was fine.

2071
02:11:46,619 --> 02:11:49,949
You should put Radan higher.

2072
02:11:49,949 --> 02:11:55,100
I probably will.

2073
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,720
Alright.

2074
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,720
The Tree Sentinel was...

2075
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,720
I know they did it a few times, right?

2076
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,859
But.

2077
02:12:02,859 --> 02:12:05,500
That fight was really cool.

2078
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:08,500
Because the first time you see the Tree Sentinel.

2079
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,500
It's almost like, holy shit.

2080
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,500
There's a boss right there.

2081
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:20,569
And that's the first time you have to do any horseback fighting if you wanted to.

2082
02:12:20,569 --> 02:12:22,569
And it was really intense.

2083
02:12:22,569 --> 02:12:29,119
I like it there for now.

2084
02:12:29,119 --> 02:12:33,220
We'll see in a minute.

2085
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:34,220
Hatches.

2086
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:37,119
Eh.

2087
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:42,539
I wouldn't really call this a boss fight as much as an NPC encounter.

2088
02:12:42,539 --> 02:12:43,539
But whatever.

2089
02:12:43,539 --> 02:12:51,819
I'm going to make a new category here.

2090
02:12:51,819 --> 02:12:52,819
For mini bosses.

2091
02:12:52,819 --> 02:12:55,699
I don't think it should be on here.

2092
02:12:55,699 --> 02:12:57,939
I'm going to make a category for mini bosses.

2093
02:12:57,939 --> 02:13:01,689
And that's it's own category.

2094
02:13:01,689 --> 02:13:02,689
Yeah.

2095
02:13:02,689 --> 02:13:07,510
That's a good idea.

2096
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:08,510
Mini boss.

2097
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:16,279
That's better.

2098
02:13:16,279 --> 02:13:20,060
Okay.

2099
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:22,140
So.

2100
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:23,140
Mini bosses.

2101
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:24,140
Because these are going to just...

2102
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:25,140
It's going to get all gummed up.

2103
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,630
It is.

2104
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:27,630
This just doesn't belong here.

2105
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:28,630
Right?

2106
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,630
This is going to get all gummed up.

2107
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:30,630
And I don't want it to.

2108
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:31,630
Tree Spirit.

2109
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,630
That was a mini boss.

2110
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:33,630
Technically.

2111
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:34,630
It's going to get all gummed up.

2112
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:38,750
Who else is a mini boss?

2113
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:45,279
Tibia Mariner belongs down there.

2114
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:48,279
Tibia Mariner I don't think deserves to be down there.

2115
02:13:48,279 --> 02:13:56,430
Hmm.

2116
02:13:56,430 --> 02:14:03,260
I mean very clearly we know what a mini boss is.

2117
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,260
Right?

2118
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:05,260
Like the Crystillion.

2119
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:06,260
That's a mini boss.

2120
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:09,329
I'm just going to get them up here and they'll do it.

2121
02:14:09,329 --> 02:14:12,329
Dragonkin Soldier is kind of a mini boss.

2122
02:14:12,329 --> 02:14:13,329
Wouldn't it?

2123
02:14:13,329 --> 02:14:17,359
The Ancient Hero of Zamor.

2124
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:18,359
That's a mini boss.

2125
02:14:18,359 --> 02:14:24,569
There are like five Tibia Mariners.

2126
02:14:24,569 --> 02:14:29,779
That's true.

2127
02:14:29,779 --> 02:14:30,779
Future...

2128
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:31,779
Oh yeah.

2129
02:14:31,779 --> 02:14:32,779
All the tree avatars.

2130
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:36,550
Okay.

2131
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:40,729
Do you really think that Sanguine Noble is something that should be up on the boss list?

2132
02:14:40,729 --> 02:14:49,109
I don't think so.

2133
02:14:49,109 --> 02:14:51,109
Runebear is not a boss.

2134
02:14:51,109 --> 02:14:52,109
I know.

2135
02:14:52,109 --> 02:14:57,529
I know that they show up everywhere.

2136
02:14:57,529 --> 02:14:58,529
Royal Knight Loretta.

2137
02:14:58,529 --> 02:15:01,729
This is the same fight.

2138
02:15:01,729 --> 02:15:02,729
Just a little bit different.

2139
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:04,729
I actually liked the first one more.

2140
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:09,829
I'm going to put it up.

2141
02:15:09,829 --> 02:15:11,829
Beasts of Farum Azula.

2142
02:15:11,829 --> 02:15:13,970
About here.

2143
02:15:13,970 --> 02:15:14,970
Mini boss.

2144
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:18,550
All the dragons are mini bosses.

2145
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:19,550
Mini bosses.

2146
02:15:19,550 --> 02:15:20,550
They're going up in the same place.

2147
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:24,859
Percival Knight.

2148
02:15:24,859 --> 02:15:25,859
Mini boss.

2149
02:15:25,859 --> 02:15:30,300
The second one is way better.

2150
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:31,300
I liked the first one better.

2151
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:32,300
I don't know why.

2152
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:36,180
Our Urchary Avatar is times five.

2153
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:38,189
Times three.

2154
02:15:38,189 --> 02:15:39,189
Times two.

2155
02:15:39,189 --> 02:15:40,189
Times...

2156
02:15:40,189 --> 02:15:41,189
Yeah.

2157
02:15:41,189 --> 02:15:44,159
Times two.

2158
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:45,159
Percival Knight.

2159
02:15:45,159 --> 02:15:49,789
Yeah.

2160
02:15:49,789 --> 02:15:50,789
Wraith Worm.

2161
02:15:50,789 --> 02:15:52,789
This is technically a mini boss, right?

2162
02:15:52,789 --> 02:15:54,029
Technically.

2163
02:15:54,029 --> 02:15:58,960
Miranda the Blighted Bloom.

2164
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,960
I don't even know what this was.

2165
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,779
Percival Knight Duo.

2166
02:16:03,779 --> 02:16:06,960
I don't even know what that is.

2167
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:07,960
Kindred of Wrought Duo.

2168
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,960
Did I do those?

2169
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,199
I think so.

2170
02:16:10,199 --> 02:16:12,210
Elber of the Briar.

2171
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:14,579
I don't know what that is.

2172
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:17,420
Fortisax is really cool.

2173
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:19,420
That's going to pie on the mini boss list.

2174
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:20,979
Wait.

2175
02:16:20,979 --> 02:16:21,979
Was Fortisax a mini boss?

2176
02:16:21,979 --> 02:16:27,380
Kind of, right?

2177
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:28,380
No, it hadn't...

2178
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:29,380
No, no, no, it wasn't.

2179
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:31,380
But I just was so overleveled it felt like one.

2180
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:36,180
It was a really, really cool fight though.

2181
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:39,180
I just killed it in like not even a minute.

2182
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:43,139
Oh, I remember Necromancer Garrus.

2183
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:47,500
The Red Wolf of the Champions.

2184
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,500
Yep.

2185
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:50,500
That's a mini boss.

2186
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,799
Spirit Caller Snail.

2187
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:55,129
Did I fight that?

2188
02:16:55,129 --> 02:16:58,200
Mad Pumpkin Head.

2189
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:01,940
Nox Duo.

2190
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,940
I didn't do that.

2191
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:05,299
Nox Duo.

2192
02:17:05,299 --> 02:17:09,229
Hezgar...

2193
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:10,229
Well, that's not the right game.

2194
02:17:10,229 --> 02:17:12,920
Lienrot Knight Duo.

2195
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:13,920
I don't think I did that either.

2196
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:18,270
The Demi-Human Queen.

2197
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,270
Three of them.

2198
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:24,459
I think I did one of these.

2199
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:25,459
Eve of Fire.

2200
02:17:25,459 --> 02:17:26,459
Did I do that?

2201
02:17:26,459 --> 02:17:27,459
I don't remember.

2202
02:17:27,459 --> 02:17:28,459
There's so many bosses I don't remember.

2203
02:17:28,459 --> 02:17:32,940
I remember the Crystalline Duo.

2204
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,940
I remember Wyrmface.

2205
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:38,010
Wyrmface was kind of a...

2206
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:40,250
Was a real boss though.

2207
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:43,729
Not really.

2208
02:17:43,729 --> 02:17:44,729
Did you even play Elden Ring?

2209
02:17:44,729 --> 02:17:45,729
Dude, I streamed all...

2210
02:17:45,729 --> 02:17:46,729
Yes.

2211
02:17:46,729 --> 02:17:51,319
Flying Dragon?

2212
02:17:51,319 --> 02:17:55,030
Commander O'Neil.

2213
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:56,030
Didn't I already do this?

2214
02:17:56,030 --> 02:17:57,030
Was it a different person?

2215
02:17:57,030 --> 02:18:01,149
Featured avatars.

2216
02:18:01,149 --> 02:18:02,149
Yep.

2217
02:18:02,149 --> 02:18:03,149
Put them up there as well.

2218
02:18:03,149 --> 02:18:07,389
It's going to be way too hard to put these anywhere remotely up with all the regular

2219
02:18:07,389 --> 02:18:08,389
bosses, in quotes, right?

2220
02:18:08,389 --> 02:18:09,389
It just is.

2221
02:18:09,389 --> 02:18:17,989
Battle Mage Hughes?

2222
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:18,989
Rafted Sion?

2223
02:18:18,989 --> 02:18:22,920
I don't know.

2224
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:27,590
Did I fight this?

2225
02:18:27,590 --> 02:18:28,590
You're not doing a Tireless.

2226
02:18:28,590 --> 02:18:36,180
You're doing a shitty From Software wiki.

2227
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:38,489
You have to put them up here.

2228
02:18:38,489 --> 02:18:40,489
I gotta put them up here first.

2229
02:18:40,489 --> 02:18:43,049
What do you mean?

2230
02:18:43,049 --> 02:18:48,120
There are like 300 squares in this.

2231
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,579
This is not a wiki page.

2232
02:18:52,579 --> 02:18:58,840
This is a list of my favorite bosses throughout the whole series.

2233
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,840
We haven't...

2234
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,840
I have to get them up here.

2235
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:08,879
There are 10 Knight's Calvaries?

2236
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:14,379
Holy shit.

2237
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:20,799
I didn't fight that.

2238
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:25,700
I did fight the Falling Starbeast.

2239
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:28,200
But not these ones.

2240
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:29,200
Did I?

2241
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,200
Where is it?

2242
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,200
Yes.

2243
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:35,079
Super Falling Starbeast, right?

2244
02:19:35,079 --> 02:19:37,079
That's when I fought.

2245
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:44,170
Is that a miniboss?

2246
02:19:44,170 --> 02:19:50,120
These are minibosses?

2247
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,360
Sentinel Tree Bob?

2248
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,920
Brave Warden Flying Dragon?

2249
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:55,920
You know what?

2250
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,920
All the minibosses are on the same fucking level.

2251
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:58,920
Okay.

2252
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,920
There's too many.

2253
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:04,569
And I didn't even do like a third of these.

2254
02:20:04,569 --> 02:20:07,899
So, minibosses are just...

2255
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:11,700
Whatever.

2256
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:12,700
We just delete it.

2257
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:14,129
Yeah, just delete it.

2258
02:20:14,129 --> 02:20:15,559
Yeah.

2259
02:20:15,559 --> 02:20:16,559
I just delete it.

2260
02:20:16,559 --> 02:20:18,889
No.

2261
02:20:18,889 --> 02:20:20,889
All the minibosses, we're not even gonna put them.

2262
02:20:20,889 --> 02:20:21,889
Who cares?

2263
02:20:21,889 --> 02:20:25,110
No.

2264
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:27,110
All the minibosses, they were cool, they were fun.

2265
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:33,850
But I don't need to place like three Stone Digger Trolls.

2266
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:40,389
So, who is a real boss that's still down here?

2267
02:20:40,389 --> 02:20:49,500
None of them.

2268
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:51,510
They're all up there.

2269
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:55,479
All the dragons, I'd say, are up there.

2270
02:20:55,479 --> 02:20:56,479
Wait.

2271
02:20:56,479 --> 02:21:01,690
Godskin?

2272
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:02,690
There are too many.

2273
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:05,530
Brave...

2274
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,530
I don't know.

2275
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:07,530
These are all minibosses.

2276
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:08,530
Agent Dragon...

2277
02:21:08,530 --> 02:21:10,979
Oh, this one.

2278
02:21:10,979 --> 02:21:11,979
Right?

2279
02:21:11,979 --> 02:21:17,770
This is a boss.

2280
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:19,139
This is a real boss.

2281
02:21:19,139 --> 02:21:20,139
This is the worst tier list.

2282
02:21:20,139 --> 02:21:21,139
Dude, just give me a minute.

2283
02:21:21,139 --> 02:21:22,139
I'm going to get...

2284
02:21:22,139 --> 02:21:28,180
I'm gonna put this shit where it goes.

2285
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:29,180
Tibia Mariner.

2286
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,479
Remove it.

2287
02:21:30,479 --> 02:21:34,850
But that's our wall to determine if somebody's cool or not.

2288
02:21:34,850 --> 02:21:35,850
All right.

2289
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:36,850
There are four Tibia Mariners.

2290
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:37,850
I get it.

2291
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:40,729
But that's like the wall for...

2292
02:21:40,729 --> 02:21:41,729
It's something cool.

2293
02:21:41,729 --> 02:21:44,440
Fine.

2294
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:45,440
I need to have a new wall then.

2295
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:46,440
Fine.

2296
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:53,309
Fine.

2297
02:21:53,309 --> 02:21:57,500
It's gone.

2298
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:00,079
Okay.

2299
02:22:00,079 --> 02:22:03,500
We're good.

2300
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,500
All right.

2301
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:05,500
Put the Taurus Demon up there as a wall.

2302
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:06,500
No.

2303
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:07,799
The Taurus Demon sucks ass.

2304
02:22:07,799 --> 02:22:08,799
No.

2305
02:22:08,799 --> 02:22:14,670
That's not the wall of if you're cool.

2306
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:16,670
The Taurus Demon is stupid.

2307
02:22:16,670 --> 02:22:18,100
All right.

2308
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:21,409
The wall for if you are cooler than a sea.

2309
02:22:21,409 --> 02:22:31,100
Shit.

2310
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:57,620
These have got to go.

2311
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:58,620
I got to get rid of the miniboss.

2312
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:05,229
These are miniboss versions.

2313
02:23:05,229 --> 02:23:06,229
You're working backwards.

2314
02:23:06,229 --> 02:23:07,229
It's a...

2315
02:23:07,229 --> 02:23:09,879
I got it.

2316
02:23:10,879 --> 02:23:18,010
The first Elden Lord, a lemonade version of him, is...

2317
02:23:18,010 --> 02:23:19,760
I would say...

2318
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,190
What happened to my eye?

2319
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:24,120
Is a sea.

2320
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:25,940
Straight up sea.

2321
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:29,739
Sea.

2322
02:23:29,739 --> 02:23:31,229
So...

2323
02:23:31,229 --> 02:23:36,120
We have to do some work here.

2324
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,120
Death bird.

2325
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:42,389
Get out.

2326
02:23:42,389 --> 02:23:44,750
Is Ranala cooler than the Godfrey?

2327
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:48,219
Yeah.

2328
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:51,420
Is Tower Knight cooler than Godfrey?

2329
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:52,420
Radagon is definitely better.

2330
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:59,860
I just thought...

2331
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:00,860
I thought...

2332
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:02,579
The Radagon right into the final boss.

2333
02:24:02,579 --> 02:24:06,260
Elden Beast.

2334
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:07,260
Just...

2335
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,780
I don't know.

2336
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:11,459
I don't like that.

2337
02:24:11,459 --> 02:24:12,459
I don't know.

2338
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:21,540
I'm okay with it being at a bit...

2339
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:24,739
Radagon's fight was really cool and then they just like, all right, here, if I end the game

2340
02:24:24,739 --> 02:24:28,420
now.

2341
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:29,420
The Elden Beast was all right.

2342
02:24:29,420 --> 02:24:30,420
I don't think it's bad.

2343
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,420
I don't think it was great either though.

2344
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:41,620
We got to start from the bottom.

2345
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,899
No F's in Elden Ring?

2346
02:24:42,899 --> 02:24:43,899
Oh yeah, there is.

2347
02:24:43,899 --> 02:24:44,899
It's like two of the major characters.

2348
02:24:44,899 --> 02:24:58,340
Oh my god.

2349
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:09,620
I will move Radan because Radan is better than the Asylum Demon, I guess.

2350
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:10,620
Not...

2351
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,620
I like Gideon more than Radan.

2352
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:30,450
He can stay there.

2353
02:25:30,489 --> 02:25:35,799
We might see some S's from Sekiro.

2354
02:25:35,799 --> 02:25:36,799
We're almost done.

2355
02:25:36,799 --> 02:25:40,840
We've got Dark Souls 3 Sekiro and then Sprinkle in Dark Souls 2.

2356
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:41,840
This is almost done.

2357
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:48,360
Okay, let me get Elden Ring done.

2358
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:51,370
Horolue, Slave Knight Gale.

2359
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:55,659
Was Horolue cooler than Slave Knight Gale?

2360
02:25:55,659 --> 02:25:57,459
It's too recent, but I don't think so.

2361
02:25:57,459 --> 02:26:02,280
It's tricky.

2362
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:07,489
I don't think so.

2363
02:26:07,489 --> 02:26:09,569
I think that makes sense to me.

2364
02:26:09,569 --> 02:26:11,530
I think this makes sense to me as well.

2365
02:26:11,530 --> 02:26:14,819
Now, that's recency bias.

2366
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:23,420
Put it back.

2367
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:31,200
These are the same boss, but I'm going to keep this one because it's Loretta, right?

2368
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,879
This is kind of like the two versions of this boss.

2369
02:26:33,879 --> 02:26:43,500
Okay.

2370
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:46,739
That's not fair.

2371
02:26:46,739 --> 02:26:47,739
I like that.

2372
02:26:47,739 --> 02:26:52,799
Ligarius is better than Malakith.

2373
02:26:52,799 --> 02:26:57,540
I feel like Malakith's fight is so quick.

2374
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:59,440
It's just a DPS burn fight.

2375
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:03,780
It's really cool, but I don't know.

2376
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:13,620
I think some of these have to come back.

2377
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:14,979
Malakith needs more HP.

2378
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,799
How many humans do you sacrifice to look so young?

2379
02:27:21,799 --> 02:27:22,799
Zero.

2380
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:24,120
I have a skincare routine.

2381
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:28,420
I talked about it earlier during the Fortnite thing.

2382
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:29,420
Moisturize your face.

2383
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:30,420
Moisturize your face.

2384
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:34,979
When you're out of the shower, get a nice light moisturizer and just get it on there

2385
02:27:34,979 --> 02:27:35,979
and rub it in.

2386
02:27:35,979 --> 02:27:38,639
It takes 10 seconds.

2387
02:27:38,639 --> 02:27:40,200
Please.

2388
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:41,569
I'm telling you.

2389
02:27:41,569 --> 02:27:45,370
Do it.

2390
02:27:45,370 --> 02:27:46,370
All right.

2391
02:27:46,370 --> 02:27:53,690
Raikard was...

2392
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:54,690
Raikard is...

2393
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:55,690
Okay.

2394
02:27:55,690 --> 02:28:00,979
Raikard and Gaping Dragon are similar.

2395
02:28:00,979 --> 02:28:01,979
Fire Giant comes down.

2396
02:28:02,219 --> 02:28:14,239
Is Malakith cooler than Astel, probably?

2397
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:15,239
But no.

2398
02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:16,600
But the fight doesn't last long enough.

2399
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:20,059
Kalamith's probably not as cool, though.

2400
02:28:20,059 --> 02:28:24,239
Ligarius is cooler than all of them.

2401
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:25,239
No smoking and no drinking.

2402
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:26,899
I mean, I drink.

2403
02:28:26,899 --> 02:28:34,969
I drink maybe once a month, maybe five or six times a year, maybe.

2404
02:28:34,969 --> 02:28:39,600
Maybe like 10 times a year, maybe.

2405
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:40,600
I don't smoke.

2406
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:42,319
I don't really drink that often.

2407
02:28:42,719 --> 02:28:52,850
I mean, I dabble in THC a little with CBD, but not, you know, crazy.

2408
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:55,659
I don't drink that much alcohol, though.

2409
02:28:55,659 --> 02:28:57,610
All right.

2410
02:28:57,610 --> 02:29:02,819
Let's keep going.

2411
02:29:02,819 --> 02:29:08,209
I actually don't think I have to move any of this.

2412
02:29:08,209 --> 02:29:09,209
Maybe this.

2413
02:29:09,209 --> 02:29:10,209
I'm trying...

2414
02:29:10,209 --> 02:29:11,649
I wish I bought this at the right level.

2415
02:29:11,649 --> 02:29:17,309
It would probably be way higher.

2416
02:29:17,309 --> 02:29:18,549
What's cooler than the Tree Sentinel?

2417
02:29:18,549 --> 02:29:19,989
Like, let's be honest.

2418
02:29:19,989 --> 02:29:26,340
Yeah.

2419
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:27,340
I like this.

2420
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:32,180
I think this is good.

2421
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,700
Shadow's Yarnham cooler than Ranala.

2422
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:34,700
Yep.

2423
02:29:34,739 --> 02:29:35,739
Noble needs to come down.

2424
02:29:35,739 --> 02:29:38,139
How does the old hero...

2425
02:29:38,139 --> 02:29:40,139
The old hero and old punk.

2426
02:29:40,139 --> 02:29:48,739
Okay, nobody move.

2427
02:29:48,739 --> 02:29:52,700
Is Gideon cooler than Godfrey?

2428
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:55,030
What do you think?

2429
02:29:55,030 --> 02:30:01,459
He might...

2430
02:30:01,459 --> 02:30:07,299
It might be.

2431
02:30:07,299 --> 02:30:08,479
Hmm.

2432
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:17,979
Maybe.

2433
02:30:17,979 --> 02:30:18,979
Okay.

2434
02:30:18,979 --> 02:30:19,979
Yeah.

2435
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:20,979
You know, you're right.

2436
02:30:20,979 --> 02:30:21,979
You're right.

2437
02:30:21,979 --> 02:30:22,979
You're right.

2438
02:30:22,979 --> 02:30:23,979
Right.

2439
02:30:23,979 --> 02:30:25,860
Fia's Champion belongs down here.

2440
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:26,860
I'm gonna put Melania behind the Mimic tier.

2441
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:27,860
I laughed out loud.

2442
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:29,420
No, I'm not.

2443
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:30,420
Fuck that fight.

2444
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:31,420
I was just doing that to make you happy.

2445
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:33,590
And this is my list.

2446
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:34,590
Sorry.

2447
02:30:34,590 --> 02:30:38,780
I'm sorry.

2448
02:30:38,819 --> 02:30:42,459
I think Elden Ring is good.

2449
02:30:42,459 --> 02:30:44,459
Three A's from Elden Ring so far.

2450
02:30:44,459 --> 02:30:45,639
Do they belong up there?

2451
02:30:45,639 --> 02:30:46,639
And one S.

2452
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:57,620
No representation at all from Dark Souls 1.

2453
02:30:57,620 --> 02:31:01,909
You missed like 60 bosses.

2454
02:31:01,909 --> 02:31:03,909
I think I'm okay with that.

2455
02:31:03,909 --> 02:31:12,100
I think because there's a lot of B's and A's.

2456
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:13,100
Margit was...

2457
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:17,819
Yeah, the Ancestor Spirit I like more than some of these.

2458
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:19,500
Right there.

2459
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:21,370
Right there.

2460
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:23,500
Right here.

2461
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,500
Gwynn, come back.

2462
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:25,500
You were stupid.

2463
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:27,680
You were cool but stupid.

2464
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:35,260
And you too.

2465
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:36,260
Okay.

2466
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:38,899
I like what they are.

2467
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:40,440
All right.

2468
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:41,440
Looks good so far.

2469
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,000
Now it's time...

2470
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,370
Remember we're not doing mini bosses.

2471
02:31:46,370 --> 02:31:47,370
So all these.

2472
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:48,370
These like...

2473
02:31:48,370 --> 02:31:49,370
The Shinobi Hunter.

2474
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:50,739
The Headless.

2475
02:31:50,739 --> 02:31:53,739
We're not doing any of the mini bosses because that would be way too hard.

2476
02:31:53,739 --> 02:32:00,350
We should go to bed.

2477
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:01,350
This is not going to take that much longer.

2478
02:32:01,350 --> 02:32:02,350
No, let's do Dark Souls 3.

2479
02:32:02,350 --> 02:32:03,350
I don't...

2480
02:32:03,350 --> 02:32:07,729
Let's do Dark Souls 3.

2481
02:32:07,729 --> 02:32:08,729
Yeah, Dark Souls 3 is a good idea.

2482
02:32:08,729 --> 02:32:14,059
Okay.

2483
02:32:14,059 --> 02:32:15,059
Pontiff Sullivan.

2484
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:19,030
Pontiff Sullivan is going to be up here.

2485
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:28,649
Cooler than Lagarius but I don't think cooler than Loretta.

2486
02:32:28,649 --> 02:32:30,909
Maybe.

2487
02:32:30,909 --> 02:32:37,459
I think so.

2488
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:44,930
The ones that I remember...

2489
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:45,930
I remember this fight.

2490
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:46,930
I don't like it.

2491
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:47,930
This is like a D.

2492
02:32:47,930 --> 02:32:51,100
This is the caster with the big tail.

2493
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:52,100
Yeah.

2494
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:53,100
Didn't like that one very much.

2495
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:56,180
It was kind of like eh.

2496
02:32:56,180 --> 02:32:57,180
Put that next to Gideon I think.

2497
02:32:57,180 --> 02:33:00,440
The fight was kind of ass.

2498
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:03,020
All right.

2499
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:04,020
Gundyr.

2500
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,020
I'm going to just put one Gundyr.

2501
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:08,020
And I actually really like the Gundyr fight.

2502
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:10,020
Except the phase two is kind of annoying.

2503
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:11,329
But I like the fight.

2504
02:33:11,329 --> 02:33:15,260
Let's put...

2505
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:17,260
Where's champion Gundyr?

2506
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:20,520
We'll leave index down here because it's literally the same thing.

2507
02:33:20,559 --> 02:33:26,489
Oh, the Lothric Prince fight.

2508
02:33:26,489 --> 02:33:27,489
That was awesome.

2509
02:33:27,489 --> 02:33:34,299
Yep.

2510
02:33:34,299 --> 02:33:35,299
That's going up to A.

2511
02:33:35,299 --> 02:33:37,239
I liked that fight.

2512
02:33:37,239 --> 02:33:41,180
Somebody's riding on the other ones back.

2513
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:43,579
Can we get a refresher?

2514
02:33:43,579 --> 02:33:44,579
Yeah, we can do some refreshers.

2515
02:33:44,579 --> 02:33:45,579
Turn the music off.

2516
02:33:45,579 --> 02:33:48,670
Why can I not?

2517
02:33:48,670 --> 02:33:58,149
Okay.

2518
02:33:58,149 --> 02:34:00,149
We'll do some refreshers on some of these.

2519
02:34:00,149 --> 02:34:01,149
We don't need too much though.

2520
02:34:01,149 --> 02:34:06,360
Okay.

2521
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:08,110
This is index Gundyr.

2522
02:34:08,110 --> 02:34:09,110
Vort.

2523
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:10,110
I don't think we need it.

2524
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:11,110
All these...

2525
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:12,110
Oh, no, no, no.

2526
02:34:12,110 --> 02:34:13,110
How do I get this one in F?

2527
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,110
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

2528
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:16,569
In a single video.

2529
02:34:16,569 --> 02:34:17,569
That's right.

2530
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:23,129
Curse Rod of Greatwood is just the Erd Tree avatars, but way bigger and more annoying.

2531
02:34:23,129 --> 02:34:31,170
You had to like pop the bubbles, right?

2532
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:33,170
Yeah, that one was okay.

2533
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:39,440
Crystal Sage was kind of rage inducing.

2534
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:41,440
I know everyone thought that was one of the easiest bosses.

2535
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:42,440
It took me a long time.

2536
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:43,440
I remember...

2537
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:45,440
I remember dying like 20 times to this on stream.

2538
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:50,639
How's that annoying teleport and then bring every...

2539
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:52,639
You just clone yourself 10 times.

2540
02:34:52,639 --> 02:34:54,639
The Abyss Watchers were cool.

2541
02:34:54,639 --> 02:34:59,120
Probably B, I would say.

2542
02:34:59,159 --> 02:35:01,549
That fight was pretty fun.

2543
02:35:01,549 --> 02:35:02,549
They fight each other.

2544
02:35:02,549 --> 02:35:09,819
And then it gets all smoky and fiery.

2545
02:35:09,819 --> 02:35:10,819
Yeah, this was cool.

2546
02:35:10,819 --> 02:35:18,659
I feel like a lot of the Dark Souls 3 bosses are going to be very high.

2547
02:35:18,659 --> 02:35:19,659
That was kind of...

2548
02:35:19,659 --> 02:35:20,659
That was kind of like the shine...

2549
02:35:20,659 --> 02:35:24,010
I can't even speak.

2550
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:27,010
That was kind of the shining part of the game for Dark Souls 3 for me.

2551
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:28,010
It was...

2552
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:29,010
The bosses I thought were great.

2553
02:35:29,010 --> 02:35:31,010
Deacons are going to be F.

2554
02:35:31,010 --> 02:35:32,010
Comedy F though.

2555
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:36,319
So it's not like I hate it.

2556
02:35:36,319 --> 02:35:38,069
It's just...

2557
02:35:38,069 --> 02:35:39,069
The fight is not that great.

2558
02:35:39,069 --> 02:35:40,069
Wolnir...

2559
02:35:40,069 --> 02:35:41,069
Oh, yeah.

2560
02:35:41,069 --> 02:35:47,559
This is the big guy with the handgun.

2561
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:48,600
Oh, yeah.

2562
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:49,600
This is the big guy with the hands.

2563
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:51,600
You have to hit the bracelet, right?

2564
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:53,420
This guy was cool.

2565
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:54,909
Fuck, man.

2566
02:35:54,909 --> 02:35:55,909
This is a good game.

2567
02:35:55,909 --> 02:36:02,180
Old Demon King.

2568
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:05,920
I remember this one.

2569
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:09,340
What was this one?

2570
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:13,329
Oh, yeah.

2571
02:36:13,329 --> 02:36:14,329
Am I...

2572
02:36:14,329 --> 02:36:23,469
Do I have rose-tinted glasses on or is this game amazing?

2573
02:36:23,469 --> 02:36:28,620
Pontiff.

2574
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:29,620
Yeah, we already know Pontiff.

2575
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:30,620
Aldrich.

2576
02:36:30,620 --> 02:36:33,920
Yhorm is probably a D.

2577
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,920
It's a gimmick fight.

2578
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:38,920
Yhorm is just Rikard but boring.

2579
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:42,479
This is the same exact fight.

2580
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:43,479
No difference at all.

2581
02:36:43,479 --> 02:36:48,500
Okay.

2582
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:50,120
Dancer, the boy real.

2583
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:51,120
Dancer was cool.

2584
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,120
I beat Dancer first try.

2585
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:57,090
Although a little spammy though.

2586
02:36:57,090 --> 02:37:00,090
I'm not sure this is higher than a B- or a C.

2587
02:37:00,090 --> 02:37:02,100
There's a little spammy.

2588
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:10,500
Dragonslayer?

2589
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:11,500
Armor?

2590
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:16,649
D.

2591
02:37:16,649 --> 02:37:17,649
This guy sucks.

2592
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:24,979
This is the guy that leaves the area and shoots you with fucking shit from across the game.

2593
02:37:24,979 --> 02:37:26,469
I hated this fight.

2594
02:37:26,469 --> 02:37:28,469
This guy was annoying.

2595
02:37:28,469 --> 02:37:32,120
And all that crap comes in just spamming at you.

2596
02:37:32,159 --> 02:37:33,159
Yeah, this fight.

2597
02:37:33,159 --> 02:37:34,159
This guy's a D+.

2598
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:37,829
This guy leaves and then...

2599
02:37:37,829 --> 02:37:38,829
Yeah, he does.

2600
02:37:38,829 --> 02:37:39,829
Watch.

2601
02:37:39,829 --> 02:37:43,250
He leaves.

2602
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:44,250
He doesn't leave?

2603
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:48,899
Who's the boss that leaves the area and then spams shit at you?

2604
02:37:48,899 --> 02:37:57,219
This guy does not do that.

2605
02:37:57,219 --> 02:38:01,139
Butterfly?

2606
02:38:01,139 --> 02:38:03,979
Okay, well.

2607
02:38:03,979 --> 02:38:07,979
I love this.

2608
02:38:07,979 --> 02:38:08,979
I love this fight.

2609
02:38:08,979 --> 02:38:11,860
There's an old little ocelot.

2610
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:13,860
I will protect you.

2611
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:15,030
Is it A?

2612
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:24,930
He's holding what he thinks is like a baby or something?

2613
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:25,930
Yeah, this is a cool fight.

2614
02:38:25,930 --> 02:38:26,930
This is a wild boss.

2615
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:28,930
This is at least A+.

2616
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:31,190
This is terrifying.

2617
02:38:31,229 --> 02:38:41,860
There's Champion Gundyr, so I think this should be pretty high too.

2618
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:42,860
Damn.

2619
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:49,659
Am I being shown that I actually like Dark Souls 3 more than all of them?

2620
02:38:49,659 --> 02:38:52,020
I think that's what's happening.

2621
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:58,079
This is the Lothric fight where he rides on his back.

2622
02:38:58,079 --> 02:39:07,450
Yep.

2623
02:39:07,450 --> 02:39:08,450
Okay.

2624
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:09,450
I like that fight a lot.

2625
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:11,940
Ancient Wyvern.

2626
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:16,379
Oh, this was kind of a gimmick, right?

2627
02:39:16,379 --> 02:39:18,379
Don't you just like jump on his head?

2628
02:39:18,379 --> 02:39:20,139
Eh.

2629
02:39:20,139 --> 02:39:21,139
Like D.

2630
02:39:21,139 --> 02:39:27,299
Well, let's just see it, right?

2631
02:39:27,299 --> 02:39:28,299
Might as well.

2632
02:39:28,299 --> 02:39:33,040
Yeah, you have to just run through this.

2633
02:39:33,079 --> 02:39:34,079
I remember.

2634
02:39:34,079 --> 02:39:35,079
It was such a pain in the ass.

2635
02:39:35,079 --> 02:39:36,079
Just to jump on him and kill him.

2636
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:37,079
Yeah.

2637
02:39:37,079 --> 02:39:40,049
Nah.

2638
02:39:40,049 --> 02:39:41,049
This is pretty low.

2639
02:39:41,049 --> 02:39:43,440
We don't need to see it.

2640
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:44,440
Nameless King.

2641
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:46,440
Yeah, this is a great one.

2642
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:52,329
Riding the Dragon.

2643
02:39:52,329 --> 02:40:02,940
This was insane.

2644
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:06,940
He gets off the dragon and you're like, oh my god, I gotta fight this guy.

2645
02:40:06,940 --> 02:40:13,780
Might as well just refresh, right?

2646
02:40:13,780 --> 02:40:14,780
See if we can remember.

2647
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:23,549
Yeah, this is awesome.

2648
02:40:23,549 --> 02:40:24,549
This is probably S.

2649
02:40:24,549 --> 02:40:27,549
This might be the S from Dark Souls 3.

2650
02:40:27,549 --> 02:40:33,700
The music too was so crazy.

2651
02:40:33,739 --> 02:40:37,129
Soul of Cinder.

2652
02:40:37,129 --> 02:40:38,129
Oh, this is the last one.

2653
02:40:38,129 --> 02:40:39,129
Yeah, this guy was not...

2654
02:40:39,129 --> 02:40:40,129
It was alright.

2655
02:40:40,129 --> 02:40:42,879
I would say Nameless King.

2656
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:47,879
You should have just given Soul of Cinder Nameless King's moveset and encounter.

2657
02:40:47,879 --> 02:40:56,860
I remember having fun fighting this, but I don't know if it's S.

2658
02:40:56,860 --> 02:41:01,420
Okay.

2659
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:04,459
This is the DLC.

2660
02:41:04,459 --> 02:41:07,459
This is the wolf and the grave guy, right?

2661
02:41:07,459 --> 02:41:08,459
The gravetender.

2662
02:41:08,459 --> 02:41:11,399
This looks like such shit.

2663
02:41:11,399 --> 02:41:16,799
720p.

2664
02:41:16,799 --> 02:41:23,899
I think I got really mad at this one.

2665
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:32,540
Yeah, because the wolf could just sprint at you randomly and just...

2666
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:34,540
He ran across the map like three times.

2667
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:35,540
This fight was...

2668
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:36,540
I don't like this.

2669
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:37,540
It was bad.

2670
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:41,399
It wasn't necessarily bad.

2671
02:41:41,399 --> 02:41:42,399
It was just...

2672
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:43,399
I don't know.

2673
02:41:43,399 --> 02:41:48,670
It was just frustrating.

2674
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:49,670
This is the guy stuck in the chair.

2675
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:52,670
I remember laughing at this, so that's at least a B.

2676
02:41:52,670 --> 02:42:00,479
Yeah, this is the guy that was stuck in the chair.

2677
02:42:00,479 --> 02:42:10,850
Yeah, then he gets angry and you fight him both at the same time.

2678
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:17,350
I don't think I beat this on stream without help.

2679
02:42:17,350 --> 02:42:19,530
Do I remember that correctly?

2680
02:42:19,569 --> 02:42:22,379
I think I got to a point where I was like, no, I don't care.

2681
02:42:22,379 --> 02:42:23,379
Just come help me.

2682
02:42:23,379 --> 02:42:28,250
It was a cool encounter, though.

2683
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:34,969
Let's just see the chair because it's funny.

2684
02:42:34,969 --> 02:42:47,370
Really cool, though.

2685
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:48,370
All right.

2686
02:42:48,370 --> 02:42:50,370
Demon Prince and two demons.

2687
02:42:50,370 --> 02:42:54,620
Phase three is S tier.

2688
02:42:54,620 --> 02:43:00,209
Did I do this?

2689
02:43:00,209 --> 02:43:03,940
Demon in pain.

2690
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:05,940
Demon from below.

2691
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:11,059
Did I do this?

2692
02:43:11,059 --> 02:43:15,629
You did.

2693
02:43:15,629 --> 02:43:17,450
Took me a lot of...

2694
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:19,450
Oh, I did do this.

2695
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:20,450
Yeah, I remember the area.

2696
02:43:20,450 --> 02:43:25,569
Spear of the Church.

2697
02:43:25,569 --> 02:43:33,020
It's a boss.

2698
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:36,790
Oh, this is the invasion one.

2699
02:43:36,829 --> 02:43:38,829
The PVP one.

2700
02:43:38,829 --> 02:43:45,549
Yeah, it was all right.

2701
02:43:45,549 --> 02:43:53,739
But whatever.

2702
02:43:53,739 --> 02:43:56,520
Afflite?

2703
02:43:56,520 --> 02:44:02,540
Yeah, the whole Spear of the Church thing was kind of...

2704
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:03,540
It was okay.

2705
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:05,540
It was an interesting encounter.

2706
02:44:05,540 --> 02:44:10,799
This is the one where it was actually like people could have invaded you and tried to kill you, right?

2707
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:17,780
Which is really funny.

2708
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:22,379
And then Medir, which...

2709
02:44:22,379 --> 02:44:25,379
We tried to Mario Party this boss and I don't think we beat it.

2710
02:44:25,379 --> 02:44:36,500
All these bosses are absolutely amazing, though.

2711
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:40,659
And then who could forget this?

2712
02:44:40,659 --> 02:44:41,659
He's already an S.

2713
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:46,659
Slave Knight Gale already an S might be the best.

2714
02:44:46,659 --> 02:44:55,149
This is another one of those fights that just felt like a dance.

2715
02:44:55,149 --> 02:44:58,819
It was tough.

2716
02:44:58,819 --> 02:44:59,819
It was really hard.

2717
02:44:59,819 --> 02:45:00,819
It was fair.

2718
02:45:00,819 --> 02:45:03,829
There was a lot of interesting things going on.

2719
02:45:03,829 --> 02:45:12,219
Dark Souls 3 is too easy.

2720
02:45:12,219 --> 02:45:16,819
Um, I don't think so.

2721
02:45:16,819 --> 02:45:18,819
I thought Dark Souls 3 was actually really hard.

2722
02:45:18,819 --> 02:45:25,030
This was so fun.

2723
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:29,600
I remember I didn't get mad.

2724
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:32,600
You know how you can tell when a boss is really, really good?

2725
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,780
When I don't get mad at it at all.

2726
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:39,020
It's just like, wow, this is amazing.

2727
02:45:39,059 --> 02:45:41,059
I can't wait to fight that again.

2728
02:45:41,059 --> 02:45:44,420
All the things that are in S tier were that for me.

2729
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:51,850
You mean when it's easy?

2730
02:45:51,850 --> 02:45:59,489
Garmin is not easy.

2731
02:45:59,489 --> 02:46:01,920
Horoloo is not easy.

2732
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:06,629
Ludwig is not easy either.

2733
02:46:06,629 --> 02:46:11,409
You know how many times I died to the first phase of Ludwig?

2734
02:46:11,409 --> 02:46:15,950
Horoloo is easy.

2735
02:46:15,950 --> 02:46:17,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2736
02:46:17,950 --> 02:46:20,600
This is a great fight.

2737
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,969
This fight is not even easy.

2738
02:46:21,969 --> 02:46:22,969
What are you talking about?

2739
02:46:22,969 --> 02:46:28,020
Okay, it's time.

2740
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:31,379
What time is it?

2741
02:46:31,379 --> 02:46:34,860
Oh, God, it's getting late.

2742
02:46:34,899 --> 02:46:36,899
How long have I been doing this for?

2743
02:46:36,899 --> 02:46:45,370
All right, let's do it.

2744
02:46:45,370 --> 02:46:46,370
This is where they belong.

2745
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:47,370
Old Demon King.

2746
02:46:47,370 --> 02:46:51,370
We'll see you up at the B tier.

2747
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:52,989
B minus.

2748
02:46:52,989 --> 02:46:59,760
You're on the giant.

2749
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:02,540
Dancer, B.

2750
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:05,290
Maybe high C, low B.

2751
02:47:05,290 --> 02:47:11,069
Here it is.

2752
02:47:11,069 --> 02:47:13,069
Okay, this is the Ocelot.

2753
02:47:13,069 --> 02:47:14,760
This is A.

2754
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:18,340
I'm going to have to move that around.

2755
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:23,340
Champion Gundyr, high B.

2756
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:30,049
The reason why I want to do this so bad is because I want to see what game I actually liked the least.

2757
02:47:30,049 --> 02:47:31,049
And here's the crazy thing.

2758
02:47:31,090 --> 02:47:35,329
Dark Souls 1 looks like the game I fucking liked the absolute least.

2759
02:47:35,329 --> 02:47:42,540
I came to watch the Fortnite VOD, but he's still streaming this stupid tier list.

2760
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:48,540
I hate to break it to you, but there was probably like six minutes of Fortnite gameplay in three hours.

2761
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:55,459
We were looking at a spectator screen.

2762
02:47:55,459 --> 02:47:57,459
If that's what you're here for, I'm sorry.

2763
02:47:57,459 --> 02:48:00,079
That's not what you're going to get.

2764
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:03,090
You came here for Fortnite.

2765
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:10,120
I should just delete that VOD, because it's literally five minutes of content in like three hours.

2766
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:14,659
We got to play for like ten minutes.

2767
02:48:14,659 --> 02:48:23,500
You have Demon Souls?

2768
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:24,540
Very low.

2769
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:29,139
Yeah, but I need to do the remake.

2770
02:48:29,139 --> 02:48:36,120
Everyone's going to bother me about Fortnite.

2771
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:42,389
Oh no, it was fun.

2772
02:48:42,389 --> 02:48:44,389
I actually had a great time.

2773
02:48:44,389 --> 02:48:47,389
It was fun yucking it up with the boys.

2774
02:48:47,389 --> 02:48:53,000
But if you're talking about Fortnite gameplay, what you're looking for, that's not what happened.

2775
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:58,059
That is absolutely not what happened.

2776
02:48:58,059 --> 02:49:01,129
The remake is exactly the same.

2777
02:49:01,129 --> 02:49:04,129
Yeah, but I'm remembering PlayStation 3.

2778
02:49:04,129 --> 02:49:05,370
Right?

2779
02:49:05,370 --> 02:49:07,059
Okay, let's keep going.

2780
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:12,639
Oh, the daunting task is almost complete.

2781
02:49:12,639 --> 02:49:18,350
Because I'm going to be able to burn through a lot of Sekiro really quickly.

2782
02:49:18,350 --> 02:49:23,219
Index Gundyr, I don't need to go up there.

2783
02:49:23,219 --> 02:49:29,180
Dragon Slayer armor, that's the one we just watched when I thought it was a different encounter.

2784
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:30,180
We're going to put it up here.

2785
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:32,450
They're all Fs.

2786
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:37,989
No, a lot, some of the Sekiro fights were really cool.

2787
02:49:37,989 --> 02:49:39,989
I don't, some of them were probably going to be high.

2788
02:49:39,989 --> 02:49:44,979
I really didn't like this fight at all.

2789
02:49:44,979 --> 02:49:46,350
I didn't.

2790
02:49:46,350 --> 02:49:52,420
Medir, I didn't really beat it.

2791
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:57,540
Half-Light, yeah, this is a gimmick fight.

2792
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:59,540
It was cool, but let's see.

2793
02:49:59,579 --> 02:50:05,000
Vort was fun.

2794
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I think Vort's at least a B.

2795
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:10,610
First Rod of Gwe...

2796
02:50:10,610 --> 02:50:17,020
C.

2797
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:18,020
Nameless King?

2798
02:50:18,020 --> 02:50:25,510
Yeah.

2799
02:50:25,510 --> 02:50:30,850
S.

2800
02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:31,850
The Deacons are F.

2801
02:50:31,850 --> 02:50:34,600
Welnir is somewhere in the Cs.

2802
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:40,120
Once this is here, I'm going to make sure it's very accurate, so don't worry.

2803
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:43,120
Demon Princes, I didn't even remember the fight, so I must not have liked it.

2804
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:49,600
Crystal Sage, not F, but no, it's low C.

2805
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:56,680
Abyss Watchers, high B, low A.

2806
02:50:56,680 --> 02:51:01,629
Put it here for now.

2807
02:51:01,629 --> 02:51:02,809
Demon Prince is good.

2808
02:51:02,809 --> 02:51:03,809
Welnir is like a low D.

2809
02:51:03,850 --> 02:51:12,530
Fried, is that Fried and Soup Guy?

2810
02:51:12,530 --> 02:51:13,530
The one stuck in the chair?

2811
02:51:13,530 --> 02:51:14,530
That's up there.

2812
02:51:14,530 --> 02:51:15,530
It was crazy.

2813
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:23,319
I can't say it was an S, though.

2814
02:51:23,319 --> 02:51:24,319
All right.

2815
02:51:24,319 --> 02:51:26,620
Gunder's staying down here.

2816
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:31,959
Wyvern, F.

2817
02:51:31,959 --> 02:51:33,389
Is that fair?

2818
02:51:33,389 --> 02:51:34,389
We'll find out.

2819
02:51:34,389 --> 02:51:37,760
Soul of Cinder, C, high C.

2820
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:40,760
No, that was a B, let's be fair.

2821
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:41,760
Okay.

2822
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:45,920
Dark Souls 3 is up there.

2823
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:49,819
We just have Sekiro and Dark Souls 2.

2824
02:51:49,819 --> 02:51:50,819
Make sure this is correct.

2825
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:51,860
Put some music on.

2826
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:52,860
Oh, we had the Hollow Knight one on.

2827
02:51:52,860 --> 02:51:53,860
That's fine.

2828
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:58,500
Yeah, it's getting late.

2829
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:04,489
Oh my god, I've been doing this for like four hours.

2830
02:52:04,489 --> 02:52:10,020
Holy shit.

2831
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:11,020
Wow.

2832
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:12,020
What?

2833
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:14,020
No, I haven't been doing this for four hours.

2834
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:17,430
Why am I so into this?

2835
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:20,430
I've been doing this for four hours?

2836
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:21,430
I actually can't believe that.

2837
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:26,829
All right, I gotta hurry up.

2838
02:52:26,829 --> 02:52:27,829
Jesus.

2839
02:52:27,829 --> 02:52:32,590
All right, let's get this correct.

2840
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:33,590
Wow.

2841
02:52:33,590 --> 02:52:37,709
Cool.

2842
02:52:37,709 --> 02:52:43,500
That was a good, that was a good tuba reaction.

2843
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:45,760
Yeah.

2844
02:52:45,799 --> 02:52:49,540
Was it?

2845
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:54,079
No, not this, not the second stream that I turned on.

2846
02:52:54,079 --> 02:52:56,379
I don't think this was Fortnite.

2847
02:52:56,379 --> 02:52:59,559
I think that first stream died and I did the second one, right?

2848
02:52:59,559 --> 02:53:00,559
All right.

2849
02:53:00,559 --> 02:53:01,559
Old Demon King.

2850
02:53:01,559 --> 02:53:03,819
I can stay there.

2851
02:53:03,819 --> 02:53:04,819
Dancer should be up here.

2852
02:53:04,819 --> 02:53:06,819
This is going to get so hard eventually here.

2853
02:53:06,819 --> 02:53:11,540
Is Dancer cooler than the spirit from Elden Ring?

2854
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:13,479
I think so.

2855
02:53:13,479 --> 02:53:14,479
Probably.

2856
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:23,889
And I think Dancer is better than Soul of Cinder as well.

2857
02:53:23,889 --> 02:53:35,700
I think the real test is going to be this one.

2858
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:49,860
I don't know.

2859
02:53:49,860 --> 02:53:52,950
I don't know.

2860
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:53,950
I don't know.

2861
02:53:53,950 --> 02:53:54,950
I don't know.

2862
02:53:54,950 --> 02:53:57,020
I don't know.

2863
02:53:57,059 --> 02:53:59,059
The real test is going over the dragons from Elden Ring.

2864
02:53:59,059 --> 02:54:07,020
That's the real test.

2865
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:11,209
Is Pontiff Sullivan?

2866
02:54:11,209 --> 02:54:12,209
Yes, yes he is.

2867
02:54:12,209 --> 02:54:13,829
Yes.

2868
02:54:13,829 --> 02:54:17,700
Yes.

2869
02:54:17,700 --> 02:54:18,940
No.

2870
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:28,219
No.

2871
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:29,219
The dragons were snooze?

2872
02:54:29,219 --> 02:54:30,219
No.

2873
02:54:30,219 --> 02:54:31,219
Were they?

2874
02:54:31,219 --> 02:54:32,219
I think that they're okay.

2875
02:54:32,219 --> 02:54:50,729
Bistwatcher is definitely, I think so.

2876
02:54:50,729 --> 02:54:55,719
Raid was also cooler than this.

2877
02:54:55,719 --> 02:55:03,040
Damn.

2878
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:07,350
One, two, three, four, five.

2879
02:55:07,350 --> 02:55:10,350
Five bosses from Dark Souls 3 or A or above.

2880
02:55:10,350 --> 02:55:12,850
I still have to put some more up there.

2881
02:55:12,850 --> 02:55:21,870
Fire Giant was probably, yeah.

2882
02:55:21,909 --> 02:55:25,340
Radagon and Elden Beast are better than these at the very least.

2883
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:26,340
I think so.

2884
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:28,340
That was a cool fight.

2885
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:31,799
I think it goes right against the wall here.

2886
02:55:31,799 --> 02:55:33,620
You have a McDonald's?

2887
02:55:33,620 --> 02:55:34,620
Nice.

2888
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:36,049
What's your order?

2889
02:55:36,049 --> 02:55:50,489
I actually think this is a good barrier here.

2890
02:55:50,489 --> 02:55:52,979
That's cooler than Gideon.

2891
02:55:52,979 --> 02:56:00,659
Crystal Sage, Cooler.

2892
02:56:00,659 --> 02:56:01,659
Wulner is higher.

2893
02:56:01,659 --> 02:56:04,799
I like, Old Demon King should be in C.

2894
02:56:04,799 --> 02:56:08,729
You know what?

2895
02:56:08,729 --> 02:56:10,729
Wulner was awesome because when you went to Wulner's room,

2896
02:56:10,729 --> 02:56:13,219
it was just pitch black.

2897
02:56:13,219 --> 02:56:15,219
And then you keep going and all of a sudden he's like,

2898
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:16,500
it's like, holy shit.

2899
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:17,500
What the fuck is that?

2900
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:19,899
I like that a lot.

2901
02:56:19,899 --> 02:56:27,149
This stays down here.

2902
02:56:27,149 --> 02:56:29,149
This stays down here.

2903
02:56:29,149 --> 02:56:37,520
This can go up above Nito and above Ranallo.

2904
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:45,159
Yeah, this goes down here.

2905
02:56:45,159 --> 02:56:47,159
That's a gimmick fight, but it was cool.

2906
02:56:47,159 --> 02:56:50,129
All right.

2907
02:56:50,129 --> 02:56:51,129
How we look?

2908
02:56:51,129 --> 02:56:57,489
I actually think I'm OK with this.

2909
02:56:57,489 --> 02:56:58,489
I think this is perfect.

2910
02:56:58,489 --> 02:57:03,420
The only thing I would change up here,

2911
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:11,930
surprisingly low for Medir.

2912
02:57:11,930 --> 02:57:14,360
I just, it took too long.

2913
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:16,360
Medir had way too much health.

2914
02:57:16,360 --> 02:57:17,360
It was just annoying.

2915
02:57:17,360 --> 02:57:25,260
You just suck.

2916
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:34,469
I think design-wise Medir was awesome.

2917
02:57:34,510 --> 02:57:36,510
I just realized it's just way too much health.

2918
02:57:36,510 --> 02:57:39,200
I remember summoning like four people

2919
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:43,200
and we gave Medir like five, four times more health

2920
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:45,200
and we couldn't even hurt him.

2921
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:51,299
I think collectively the four of us did like 30% damage to him.

2922
02:57:51,299 --> 02:58:09,280
I'll put Millennia up at D.

2923
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:12,479
F is for truly.

2924
02:58:12,479 --> 02:58:13,479
Well, no.

2925
02:58:13,479 --> 02:58:20,049
F is for dog shit.

2926
02:58:20,049 --> 02:58:24,979
Millennia's fight sucks, but is it like the witches of Hemwick?

2927
02:58:24,979 --> 02:58:27,540
I mean, no, it's not.

2928
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:28,540
It's OK.

2929
02:58:28,579 --> 02:58:34,680
It's OK.

2930
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:36,940
All right.

2931
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:39,659
I'm happy with it.

2932
02:58:39,659 --> 02:58:41,469
Time for Sekiro.

2933
02:58:41,469 --> 02:58:43,469
Sekiro only really has a handful

2934
02:58:43,469 --> 02:58:46,469
and we could probably get a couple of refreshers here.

2935
02:58:46,469 --> 02:58:53,739
Imagine liking the Millennia fight.

2936
02:58:53,739 --> 02:58:55,739
I mean, it's not bad.

2937
02:58:55,739 --> 02:58:57,110
It's just awful.

2938
02:58:57,110 --> 02:58:59,629
All right.

2939
02:58:59,629 --> 02:59:01,700
Sekiro.

2940
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:03,700
We need to do a little bit of research here

2941
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:08,979
because we're looking for...

2942
02:59:08,979 --> 02:59:11,979
Who was an actual boss in Sekiro?

2943
02:59:11,979 --> 02:59:27,129
I'm actually going to turn this off.

2944
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:30,170
Because there was so many mini bosses in Sekiro.

2945
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:31,170
All right.

2946
02:59:31,170 --> 02:59:32,170
All right.

2947
02:59:32,170 --> 02:59:33,790
All right.

2948
02:59:33,790 --> 02:59:43,840
So we're looking for the names that are orange.

2949
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:45,020
So it's not very money.

2950
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:47,090
Owl.

2951
02:59:47,090 --> 02:59:48,090
I didn't do Owl.

2952
02:59:48,090 --> 02:59:49,090
I don't think I fought that.

2953
02:59:49,090 --> 02:59:53,250
That's going to have to go immediately down there.

2954
02:59:53,250 --> 02:59:54,250
I don't know.

2955
02:59:54,250 --> 02:59:55,549
I don't think I did that.

2956
02:59:55,549 --> 02:59:58,780
Demon of Hatred.

2957
02:59:58,780 --> 02:59:59,780
I don't know if I did.

2958
02:59:59,780 --> 03:00:00,780
Did I do that?

2959
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:07,709
Chained Ogre is not...

2960
03:00:07,709 --> 03:00:08,709
All right.

2961
03:00:08,709 --> 03:00:09,709
This is the first fight here.

2962
03:00:09,709 --> 03:00:14,700
This is the one that you die.

2963
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:15,700
It's the tutorial one.

2964
03:00:15,739 --> 03:00:16,739
Do I really count it?

2965
03:00:16,739 --> 03:00:21,270
This is the beginning of the game.

2966
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:23,829
Demon was awful for you.

2967
03:00:23,829 --> 03:00:26,829
I feel like every one of these bosses, I was furious.

2968
03:00:26,829 --> 03:00:29,829
So I don't know how to even rate these.

2969
03:00:29,829 --> 03:00:30,829
I hated these.

2970
03:00:30,829 --> 03:00:34,610
The Owl was a story boss.

2971
03:00:34,610 --> 03:00:36,610
Did I hate everything in Sekiro?

2972
03:00:36,610 --> 03:00:39,579
No, I like...

2973
03:00:39,579 --> 03:00:40,579
No, no, no.

2974
03:00:40,579 --> 03:00:42,200
That's when everything was burning down.

2975
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:45,040
Okay.

2976
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:50,569
Let me see if I know where it is.

2977
03:00:50,569 --> 03:00:51,569
That's where the whole...

2978
03:00:51,569 --> 03:00:52,569
Everything's burning down.

2979
03:00:52,569 --> 03:00:57,540
I remember the ape was Owl.

2980
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:00,000
Owl.

2981
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,389
Isn't it where everything's burning?

2982
03:01:02,389 --> 03:01:15,750
Or is that a different fight?

2983
03:01:15,790 --> 03:01:16,790
Oh, no.

2984
03:01:16,790 --> 03:01:17,790
I did do this one.

2985
03:01:17,790 --> 03:01:18,790
Did I?

2986
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:27,840
Yeah, there's two.

2987
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:28,840
It was fun.

2988
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:29,840
You had to do this.

2989
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:32,489
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2990
03:01:32,489 --> 03:01:33,489
That one was fun.

2991
03:01:33,489 --> 03:01:34,489
Okay, what else do we need to see?

2992
03:01:34,489 --> 03:01:37,430
We need to see pretty much all the major fights, which are...

2993
03:01:37,430 --> 03:01:40,379
I don't think that's a major one.

2994
03:01:40,379 --> 03:01:41,379
Lady Butterfly.

2995
03:01:41,379 --> 03:01:42,379
Let me remember this.

2996
03:01:42,379 --> 03:01:43,379
Oh, I remember Lady Butterfly.

2997
03:01:43,379 --> 03:01:44,379
You know how I know Lady Butterfly?

2998
03:01:44,379 --> 03:01:46,260
Here's how I know.

2999
03:01:46,260 --> 03:01:51,750
Every time I've tried to replay Sekiro, I've only beaten Sekiro one time.

3000
03:01:51,750 --> 03:01:55,750
I always get to this point, lose like a dozen times in a row, and go,

3001
03:01:55,750 --> 03:01:59,909
fuck this game and uninstall it.

3002
03:01:59,950 --> 03:02:06,739
And I've tried at least probably three or four times.

3003
03:02:06,739 --> 03:02:07,739
All right, so this...

3004
03:02:07,739 --> 03:02:08,739
How do I even rate these?

3005
03:02:08,739 --> 03:02:09,739
I hate...

3006
03:02:09,739 --> 03:02:11,299
Did I hate this game?

3007
03:02:11,299 --> 03:02:12,299
There's the bull.

3008
03:02:12,299 --> 03:02:13,299
I remember the bull.

3009
03:02:13,299 --> 03:02:21,829
This was crazy, but it was kind of a cool fight.

3010
03:02:21,829 --> 03:02:24,149
I remember that.

3011
03:02:24,149 --> 03:02:25,149
These are all mini bosses.

3012
03:02:25,149 --> 03:02:30,969
Okay, I remember that one.

3013
03:02:30,969 --> 03:02:35,090
Right?

3014
03:02:35,090 --> 03:02:36,719
This is the...

3015
03:02:36,719 --> 03:02:37,719
Inichiro, right?

3016
03:02:37,719 --> 03:02:41,799
This is the first time you fight it.

3017
03:02:41,799 --> 03:02:42,799
Hard equals bad?

3018
03:02:42,799 --> 03:02:43,799
I didn't say that.

3019
03:02:43,799 --> 03:02:51,959
He turns into lightning moves, doesn't he?

3020
03:02:51,959 --> 03:02:54,040
Yeah.

3021
03:02:54,040 --> 03:03:03,729
This fight was actually pretty cool.

3022
03:03:04,170 --> 03:03:05,170
Watch yourself play this game.

3023
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:06,170
I don't know, man.

3024
03:03:06,170 --> 03:03:09,200
I remember this.

3025
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:10,200
This is F.

3026
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:11,200
This is the monkey one.

3027
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:12,200
We had to run around.

3028
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:13,379
This is F.

3029
03:03:13,379 --> 03:03:14,379
This actually might be below Bed of Chaos.

3030
03:03:14,379 --> 03:03:17,510
Yeah, this is lower than Bed of Chaos.

3031
03:03:17,510 --> 03:03:24,940
I don't even know if I would count...

3032
03:03:24,940 --> 03:03:29,219
Yeah, this is when you run around and they're all invisible.

3033
03:03:29,219 --> 03:03:31,219
It's just like not even a boss fight.

3034
03:03:31,219 --> 03:03:34,379
It's just stupid.

3035
03:03:34,379 --> 03:03:35,379
Is the Great Serpent even a fight?

3036
03:03:35,379 --> 03:03:37,819
Don't you kind of just run away from it?

3037
03:03:37,819 --> 03:03:46,739
It's not a fight.

3038
03:03:46,739 --> 03:03:48,489
Really cool, though.

3039
03:03:48,489 --> 03:03:49,489
Probably the coolest part of the game.

3040
03:03:49,489 --> 03:03:50,489
One of the coolest parts.

3041
03:03:50,489 --> 03:03:54,799
Yeah.

3042
03:03:54,799 --> 03:03:55,799
The ape.

3043
03:03:57,700 --> 03:04:02,540
The Guardian Ape, aka the Twitch streamer reaction compilation fight.

3044
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:06,909
Where, no!

3045
03:04:06,909 --> 03:04:07,909
What?

3046
03:04:07,909 --> 03:04:08,909
He's getting up!

3047
03:04:08,909 --> 03:04:09,909
No!

3048
03:04:09,909 --> 03:04:13,840
What the fuck?

3049
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:18,219
Dude!

3050
03:04:18,219 --> 03:04:23,170
It's actually cool, though.

3051
03:04:23,170 --> 03:04:27,139
I think this should be somewhere at least in A.

3052
03:04:27,139 --> 03:04:28,139
It's a really cool fight.

3053
03:04:28,139 --> 03:04:33,920
Yeah, because there's just the face cams in the corner.

3054
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,920
What the fuck?

3055
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:38,610
No, dude!

3056
03:04:38,610 --> 03:04:39,610
What?

3057
03:04:39,610 --> 03:04:43,340
Yeah.

3058
03:04:43,340 --> 03:04:46,059
I liked it, though.

3059
03:04:46,059 --> 03:04:47,059
This is the gimmick shit, right?

3060
03:04:47,059 --> 03:04:50,379
They throw the two at you at the same time.

3061
03:04:50,459 --> 03:04:52,459
I hate the fake YouTuber voice.

3062
03:04:52,459 --> 03:04:56,069
Yeah, I remember that.

3063
03:04:56,069 --> 03:04:59,020
This is not a real fight.

3064
03:04:59,020 --> 03:05:04,750
They put two at you at the same time, which is annoying.

3065
03:05:04,750 --> 03:05:06,700
Emma?

3066
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:07,700
Why do I not remember this?

3067
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:08,700
Oh, no.

3068
03:05:08,700 --> 03:05:10,700
Wait.

3069
03:05:10,700 --> 03:05:11,700
Did I fight this?

3070
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:16,409
Wasn't there an ending you could get in Sekiro that was not even halfway through the game?

3071
03:05:16,409 --> 03:05:23,540
This is part of that, right?

3072
03:05:23,540 --> 03:05:24,969
Yeah.

3073
03:05:24,969 --> 03:05:30,209
I did not do any of these.

3074
03:05:30,209 --> 03:05:31,750
This is the one where everything's on fire?

3075
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:33,569
No.

3076
03:05:33,569 --> 03:05:37,129
Am I just making up that I did that fight, or did I watch somebody else do it instead

3077
03:05:37,129 --> 03:05:43,870
that I did it?

3078
03:05:43,870 --> 03:05:52,549
I do remember the owl fight, though.

3079
03:05:52,549 --> 03:05:54,690
This fight.

3080
03:05:54,850 --> 03:05:56,409
I liked this one, actually.

3081
03:05:56,409 --> 03:06:04,079
This fight was cool.

3082
03:06:04,079 --> 03:06:05,719
This might be one of the best fights in the game.

3083
03:06:05,719 --> 03:06:18,059
Yeah, I loved this one.

3084
03:06:18,059 --> 03:06:20,170
This is when he jumps up in the tree.

3085
03:06:20,170 --> 03:06:21,170
Yeah, no.

3086
03:06:21,170 --> 03:06:25,479
It's cool.

3087
03:06:25,479 --> 03:06:26,479
This is another bull.

3088
03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:29,829
It's a mini boss.

3089
03:06:29,829 --> 03:06:30,829
Oh, yeah.

3090
03:06:30,829 --> 03:06:31,829
The big fish.

3091
03:06:31,829 --> 03:06:37,219
I wouldn't classify this as a boss, either.

3092
03:06:37,219 --> 03:06:47,459
I wonder how unfair I am to Sekiro.

3093
03:06:47,459 --> 03:06:50,149
That's not a boss, though.

3094
03:06:50,149 --> 03:06:51,469
Old Dragons of the Tree.

3095
03:06:51,469 --> 03:06:54,579
Oh, everybody made fun of me for this one.

3096
03:06:54,579 --> 03:06:56,819
They said this is the easiest boss in the game, and I couldn't do it.

3097
03:06:56,819 --> 03:07:00,170
I remember this.

3098
03:07:00,170 --> 03:07:02,569
I remember people were like, oh, Megalol, like, he can't do it.

3099
03:07:02,569 --> 03:07:04,209
This is the easiest fight in the whole game.

3100
03:07:04,209 --> 03:07:11,530
Why don't you go up on, like, pillars and shit, and they throw lightning at you?

3101
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:14,620
No, this is different.

3102
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:17,180
This is just a Deacon fight.

3103
03:07:17,180 --> 03:07:20,299
Which always goes to D, at least.

3104
03:07:20,299 --> 03:07:21,659
This is the one, the Divine Dragon.

3105
03:07:21,659 --> 03:07:33,649
Everyone made fun of me for this.

3106
03:07:33,649 --> 03:07:37,100
Yeah, this is cool.

3107
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:45,020
Even if the fight's easy, this is really, really cool.

3108
03:07:45,020 --> 03:07:47,700
I remember being awe-inspired by this one.

3109
03:07:47,700 --> 03:07:50,600
It's beautiful.

3110
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:52,540
Yep.

3111
03:07:52,540 --> 03:07:53,540
Oh, these are mini-bosses.

3112
03:07:53,540 --> 03:08:00,030
Is he even of hatred?

3113
03:08:00,030 --> 03:08:01,030
Yeah, I...

3114
03:08:01,030 --> 03:08:02,030
Yeah, I remember.

3115
03:08:02,149 --> 03:08:08,420
I'm getting flashbacks.

3116
03:08:08,420 --> 03:08:17,350
This fight did suck, though.

3117
03:08:17,350 --> 03:08:18,350
This fight was bad.

3118
03:08:18,350 --> 03:08:22,489
Did we get a raid?

3119
03:08:22,489 --> 03:08:24,500
Did we?

3120
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:26,250
We did get a raid.

3121
03:08:26,250 --> 03:08:29,219
Atriarch!

3122
03:08:29,219 --> 03:08:31,420
What's up?

3123
03:08:31,420 --> 03:08:33,899
We're doing a very long, painstaking thing.

3124
03:08:33,899 --> 03:08:35,520
Welcome, everybody.

3125
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:39,500
I hope you had a good stream, Atriarch.

3126
03:08:39,500 --> 03:08:44,260
We are trying to rate every single boss across every single From Software game.

3127
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:47,950
I've been here for about four hours.

3128
03:08:47,950 --> 03:08:50,600
Is it tough?

3129
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:52,159
I have not done Dark Souls 2 yet.

3130
03:08:52,159 --> 03:08:55,299
We're in the middle of doing Sekiro.

3131
03:08:55,299 --> 03:08:59,219
Dark Souls 2 is going to be the hardest, and in fact, I might just like...

3132
03:08:59,219 --> 03:09:00,219
I don't know.

3133
03:09:00,219 --> 03:09:02,100
It's...

3134
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:08,600
There's so many bosses in Dark Souls 2.

3135
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:11,760
I feel like every boss in Dark Souls 2, for me, is the same boss.

3136
03:09:11,760 --> 03:09:15,879
I don't know why.

3137
03:09:15,879 --> 03:09:23,959
I remember the Pursuer, and you shoot him with the bow and arrow thing.

3138
03:09:23,959 --> 03:09:24,959
I'll do it.

3139
03:09:24,959 --> 03:09:27,420
I'll do it.

3140
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:28,420
It's not going to take that long.

3141
03:09:28,420 --> 03:09:31,180
But yeah, we're going over, getting refreshers on what the bosses were, so I can remember

3142
03:09:31,180 --> 03:09:32,180
if I hated them.

3143
03:09:32,180 --> 03:09:35,489
Hated this one.

3144
03:09:35,489 --> 03:09:36,979
And then...

3145
03:09:36,979 --> 03:09:39,059
This...

3146
03:09:39,059 --> 03:09:40,059
This fight.

3147
03:09:40,059 --> 03:09:43,340
Yeah.

3148
03:09:43,340 --> 03:09:48,690
I cried during this fight, didn't I?

3149
03:09:48,690 --> 03:09:50,139
I'm pretty sure I cried.

3150
03:09:50,139 --> 03:09:51,739
I think I actually cried on camera.

3151
03:09:51,739 --> 03:09:58,020
Yeah, I think so.

3152
03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:00,979
I think this took me like 60 to 70 attempts.

3153
03:10:00,979 --> 03:10:01,979
I cried on camera.

3154
03:10:01,979 --> 03:10:09,239
Alright, I got a good idea.

3155
03:10:09,239 --> 03:10:11,000
I've got an understanding for Sekiro.

3156
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:14,739
Sad, really.

3157
03:10:14,739 --> 03:10:17,969
It's going to be sad, really.

3158
03:10:17,969 --> 03:10:25,090
Because I don't think...

3159
03:10:25,090 --> 03:10:28,250
Scary music.

3160
03:10:28,250 --> 03:10:38,219
I don't think there's anything in S or A in Sekiro.

3161
03:10:38,219 --> 03:10:39,219
I don't think so.

3162
03:10:39,219 --> 03:10:42,190
We'll find out.

3163
03:10:42,190 --> 03:10:51,290
Here we go.

3164
03:10:51,290 --> 03:10:56,840
So, okay, can I put this into like, I cried...

3165
03:10:56,840 --> 03:10:59,159
The fight is awesome.

3166
03:10:59,159 --> 03:11:01,219
It's such an amazing fight.

3167
03:11:01,219 --> 03:11:02,840
It's so beautiful.

3168
03:11:02,840 --> 03:11:04,559
And it's so...

3169
03:11:04,559 --> 03:11:06,040
The moves are so cool.

3170
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:09,280
It's such a dance, but my god, I cried on camera.

3171
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:14,989
Like, I fucking cried.

3172
03:11:14,989 --> 03:11:17,770
There were a stream of tears.

3173
03:11:17,770 --> 03:11:21,530
And I was like, I QUIT STREAMING, I QUIT STREAMING, I QUIT STREAMING!

3174
03:11:21,530 --> 03:11:22,530
And then I was like, calm down.

3175
03:11:22,530 --> 03:11:24,969
And I was like, I FUCKING QUIT STREAMING, and I turned the stream off, and I didn't

3176
03:11:24,969 --> 03:11:25,969
come back for like a week.

3177
03:11:25,969 --> 03:11:31,090
I never thought I'd quit.

3178
03:11:31,090 --> 03:11:40,940
No, I can't put it up...

3179
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:42,459
I fucking cried.

3180
03:11:42,459 --> 03:11:49,979
I'm gonna keep it there.

3181
03:11:49,979 --> 03:12:05,500
Um, Guardian Ape is gonna be A. I think.

3182
03:12:05,500 --> 03:12:07,500
I don't know if we're gonna get any S from Sekiro.

3183
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:13,520
It was just too fucking hard.

3184
03:12:13,520 --> 03:12:21,120
Lady Butterfly, F. Because even Hatred is D. Owl is not...

3185
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:29,479
Lady Butterfly is F. Because you keep preventing me from doing another playthrough.

3186
03:12:29,479 --> 03:12:31,000
The only reason.

3187
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,000
I keep...

3188
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:35,879
I've tried to play Sekiro, and I get to Lady Butterfly, and I go, why am I doing this?

3189
03:12:35,879 --> 03:12:36,879
I don't want to do it.

3190
03:12:36,879 --> 03:12:37,879
So that's...

3191
03:12:37,879 --> 03:12:38,879
You have to be there.

3192
03:12:38,879 --> 03:12:43,860
Like, you keep preventing me from playing the game.

3193
03:12:43,860 --> 03:12:45,180
This was actually awesome, though.

3194
03:12:45,180 --> 03:12:48,639
So this, let's be fair.

3195
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:49,840
Lightning moves...

3196
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:51,280
That's probably better than...

3197
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:52,280
That's bet...

3198
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:57,360
I'm sorry, it is.

3199
03:12:57,360 --> 03:12:59,239
Better than Pontiff Sullivan.

3200
03:12:59,239 --> 03:13:00,239
That was a crazy fight.

3201
03:13:00,239 --> 03:13:05,100
It was so intense.

3202
03:13:05,100 --> 03:13:10,930
Why is Butterfly lower than Pinwheel?

3203
03:13:10,930 --> 03:13:17,709
I never said it was gonna be perfect.

3204
03:13:17,709 --> 03:13:21,770
Okay.

3205
03:13:21,770 --> 03:13:22,770
I didn't...

3206
03:13:22,770 --> 03:13:26,760
I couldn't do this one.

3207
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:27,760
True Corrupted Monk.

3208
03:13:27,760 --> 03:13:28,940
Oh!

3209
03:13:28,940 --> 03:13:29,940
That's the good one.

3210
03:13:29,940 --> 03:13:30,940
Yep.

3211
03:13:30,940 --> 03:13:31,940
That's the good one.

3212
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:43,620
B.

3213
03:13:43,620 --> 03:13:50,049
Monkeys.

3214
03:13:50,049 --> 03:13:51,049
F.

3215
03:13:51,049 --> 03:13:52,049
Which one of these is the real one?

3216
03:13:52,049 --> 03:13:55,139
Corrupted Monk?

3217
03:13:55,139 --> 03:13:56,700
Over...

3218
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:57,700
That's the one I'm thinking of, right?

3219
03:13:57,700 --> 03:13:58,700
The right one?

3220
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:18,620
I like that.

3221
03:14:18,620 --> 03:14:22,299
These weren't really bosses, and if we're not doing mini-bosses, then I have to...

3222
03:14:22,299 --> 03:14:23,299
I can't put them in.

3223
03:14:23,299 --> 03:14:26,520
Corrupted...

3224
03:14:26,520 --> 03:14:27,520
No.

3225
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:30,299
That's a different game.

3226
03:14:30,299 --> 03:14:31,299
This is...

3227
03:14:31,299 --> 03:14:32,299
The...

3228
03:14:32,299 --> 03:14:33,299
Tutorial.

3229
03:14:33,299 --> 03:14:34,540
Genichiro.

3230
03:14:34,540 --> 03:14:36,610
Which...

3231
03:14:36,610 --> 03:14:37,610
I don't know if I can even place this.

3232
03:14:37,610 --> 03:14:38,610
C?

3233
03:14:38,610 --> 03:14:41,040
No, you're just supposed to die.

3234
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:42,040
I'm not gonna place it.

3235
03:14:42,040 --> 03:14:44,809
Genichiro's already up there.

3236
03:14:51,379 --> 03:14:53,329
Who is...

3237
03:14:53,329 --> 03:14:54,329
Gyobu?

3238
03:14:54,329 --> 03:15:02,290
Gyobu.

3239
03:15:02,290 --> 03:15:03,290
Who's Gyobu?

3240
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:14,879
Gyobu?

3241
03:15:14,879 --> 03:15:15,879
That's the final Genichiro.

3242
03:15:15,879 --> 03:15:16,879
Oh!

3243
03:15:16,879 --> 03:15:19,079
It's the guy on the horse!

3244
03:15:19,079 --> 03:15:20,079
Okay.

3245
03:15:20,079 --> 03:15:21,079
Now that was cool.

3246
03:15:21,079 --> 03:15:23,280
I actually liked that one.

3247
03:15:23,280 --> 03:15:38,340
A lot.

3248
03:15:38,340 --> 03:15:39,340
That one's B.

3249
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:41,159
I liked that one.

3250
03:15:41,159 --> 03:15:42,159
It was cool.

3251
03:15:42,159 --> 03:15:43,159
I don't think it's A, but it's definitely B.

3252
03:15:43,159 --> 03:15:49,329
Low...

3253
03:15:49,329 --> 03:15:50,329
Mid-B.

3254
03:15:50,329 --> 03:15:53,040
This doesn't need to be an I don't know section, then.

3255
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:57,639
Genichiro Way of Tomo is the final version when he transforms mid-fight.

3256
03:15:57,639 --> 03:16:00,159
Ah...

3257
03:16:00,159 --> 03:16:03,190
Okay.

3258
03:16:03,190 --> 03:16:16,860
That's the one I like.

3259
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:21,139
This is the tutorial one, right?

3260
03:16:21,260 --> 03:16:22,500
I don't want to fuck up Dark Souls 2.

3261
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:25,209
We're almost done.

3262
03:16:25,209 --> 03:16:26,209
Headless Ape.

3263
03:16:26,209 --> 03:16:27,209
We're in a Corrupted Monk there.

3264
03:16:27,209 --> 03:16:28,209
These are mini-bosses, right?

3265
03:16:28,209 --> 03:16:31,139
Oh, these are the ones where you...

3266
03:16:31,139 --> 03:16:32,139
Okay, I think we're done.

3267
03:16:32,139 --> 03:16:33,579
Oh, Divine Dragon.

3268
03:16:33,579 --> 03:16:36,030
Right, Divine Dragon.

3269
03:16:36,030 --> 03:16:38,299
Beautiful.

3270
03:16:38,299 --> 03:16:40,690
Beautiful fight.

3271
03:16:40,690 --> 03:16:43,459
Not an A, though.

3272
03:16:43,459 --> 03:16:49,309
All right.

3273
03:16:49,309 --> 03:16:50,309
No S's in Sekiro.

3274
03:16:50,309 --> 03:16:54,340
No S's in Sekiro.

3275
03:16:54,340 --> 03:16:56,350
Sorry.

3276
03:16:56,350 --> 03:16:58,590
No Dark Souls 1S and no Sekiro S.

3277
03:16:58,590 --> 03:16:59,590
Those are my least favorite games, then.

3278
03:16:59,590 --> 03:17:00,590
They have to be.

3279
03:17:00,590 --> 03:17:01,590
And let's build Dark Souls 2.

3280
03:17:01,590 --> 03:17:02,590
It might be like...

3281
03:17:02,590 --> 03:17:10,739
I know a lot of people really like Dark Souls 2.

3282
03:17:10,739 --> 03:17:11,739
Dark Souls 2 for me.

3283
03:17:11,739 --> 03:17:16,690
These are kind of like the left side of the Monopoly map.

3284
03:17:16,690 --> 03:17:18,290
These are not really worth that much to me.

3285
03:17:18,290 --> 03:17:19,909
You know what I mean?

3286
03:17:19,909 --> 03:17:23,700
It's like these are all Baltic Avenues.

3287
03:17:23,700 --> 03:17:24,700
I don't...

3288
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:29,579
I don't...

3289
03:17:29,579 --> 03:17:32,139
These are like, you know, Park Place, Boardwalk.

3290
03:17:32,139 --> 03:17:33,139
Up here.

3291
03:17:33,139 --> 03:17:34,139
But I don't know.

3292
03:17:34,139 --> 03:17:35,139
To me, these are all just Baltic Avenue.

3293
03:17:35,139 --> 03:17:39,459
Let's see, though.

3294
03:17:39,459 --> 03:17:45,670
I'm not going to talk shit until I do it, because that's the finale.

3295
03:17:45,670 --> 03:17:47,870
And then when I do that, I'm going to make sure it looks right.

3296
03:17:47,870 --> 03:17:50,629
And then I'm going to see what my favorite game for real is.

3297
03:17:50,629 --> 03:17:51,629
No bullshit.

3298
03:17:51,629 --> 03:17:52,629
Because you...

3299
03:17:52,629 --> 03:17:53,629
Let me...

3300
03:17:53,629 --> 03:17:55,379
Without looking.

3301
03:17:55,379 --> 03:17:56,379
Let me just tell you.

3302
03:17:56,459 --> 03:17:58,780
Not T-Rex, but like, this is where the games sit.

3303
03:17:58,780 --> 03:18:03,780
Epic.

3304
03:18:03,780 --> 03:18:06,600
Bloodborne, number one.

3305
03:18:06,600 --> 03:18:10,250
Elden Ring, number two.

3306
03:18:10,250 --> 03:18:11,940
Wait.

3307
03:18:11,940 --> 03:18:22,459
Let me start backwards.

3308
03:18:22,459 --> 03:18:24,850
Dark Souls 2, bottom.

3309
03:18:24,850 --> 03:18:27,049
Sekiro, just over that.

3310
03:18:27,049 --> 03:18:31,440
Dark Souls 1, just over that.

3311
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:34,299
Dark Souls 3, over that.

3312
03:18:34,299 --> 03:18:35,540
Wait.

3313
03:18:35,540 --> 03:18:36,540
Wait.

3314
03:18:36,540 --> 03:18:38,540
I need to write it out.

3315
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:57,010
This is my, like, you know, like, stupid fucking list.

3316
03:18:57,010 --> 03:18:58,010
Demon's Souls.

3317
03:18:58,010 --> 03:19:02,979
Dark Souls 1.

3318
03:19:02,979 --> 03:19:06,270
Zero.

3319
03:19:06,270 --> 03:19:07,270
Okay.

3320
03:19:07,270 --> 03:19:13,010
This is what my list looks like at the moment right now.

3321
03:19:13,010 --> 03:19:15,780
This is really scary.

3322
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,780
Whatever it is.

3323
03:19:16,780 --> 03:19:24,379
Is Elden Ring better than Bloodborne?

3324
03:19:24,379 --> 03:19:25,979
They're the same to me.

3325
03:19:25,979 --> 03:19:26,979
In my head right now, I can't decide.

3326
03:19:26,979 --> 03:19:32,760
Done.

3327
03:19:32,760 --> 03:19:35,510
So that's what I think.

3328
03:19:35,510 --> 03:19:39,379
We're going to find out if it's real.

3329
03:19:39,379 --> 03:19:40,379
Sekiro is done.

3330
03:19:40,379 --> 03:19:47,379
Let me just check.

3331
03:19:47,379 --> 03:20:20,579
This is such a huge wall to cross, though.

3332
03:20:20,579 --> 03:20:23,260
High B. It's not Lagarius.

3333
03:20:23,260 --> 03:20:37,370
It's not.

3334
03:20:37,370 --> 03:20:38,370
God damn it.

3335
03:20:38,370 --> 03:20:47,479
I don't know.

3336
03:20:47,479 --> 03:20:48,479
I think this has to be there.

3337
03:20:48,479 --> 03:20:49,479
I think that's actually accurate.

3338
03:20:49,479 --> 03:20:54,860
Because it's better than Lagarius.

3339
03:20:54,860 --> 03:21:06,020
It's better than Abyss Watchers.

3340
03:21:06,020 --> 03:21:07,020
Cry-Card is...

3341
03:21:07,020 --> 03:21:55,350
No, is he?

3342
03:21:55,350 --> 03:21:56,350
Dark Souls 2 is the only thing left.

3343
03:21:56,350 --> 03:22:03,139
Why is there an open can of food on your shelf?

3344
03:22:03,139 --> 03:22:14,799
There's no open can of food with a fork sticking out of it.

3345
03:22:14,799 --> 03:22:18,360
We're almost there.

3346
03:22:18,360 --> 03:22:22,420
Dark Souls 2.

3347
03:22:22,420 --> 03:22:25,770
You guys ready?

3348
03:22:25,770 --> 03:22:26,930
Find out how much we like this game.

3349
03:22:26,930 --> 03:22:36,979
Here we go.

3350
03:22:36,979 --> 03:22:39,440
Giant.

3351
03:22:39,440 --> 03:22:43,909
I remember the giant.

3352
03:22:43,909 --> 03:22:44,989
Actually not that bad.

3353
03:22:44,989 --> 03:22:51,219
It's a pretty good intro.

3354
03:22:51,219 --> 03:22:55,790
Pursuer.

3355
03:22:55,790 --> 03:22:59,389
You can kill the Pursuer in, like, two seconds if you shoot the crossbow at him.

3356
03:22:59,389 --> 03:23:03,459
I like the Pursuer because he chases you around.

3357
03:23:03,459 --> 03:23:04,459
He shows up a bunch of times.

3358
03:23:05,139 --> 03:23:06,959
It's alright.

3359
03:23:06,959 --> 03:23:07,959
Dragon Rider.

3360
03:23:07,959 --> 03:23:08,959
Oh, this is the joke.

3361
03:23:08,959 --> 03:23:09,959
Laugh out loud.

3362
03:23:09,959 --> 03:23:10,959
You make him fall off.

3363
03:23:10,959 --> 03:23:14,250
That's a C.

3364
03:23:14,250 --> 03:23:15,250
Old Dragon Slayer.

3365
03:23:15,250 --> 03:23:25,579
I don't even remember fighting this guy.

3366
03:23:25,579 --> 03:23:26,579
I don't...

3367
03:23:26,579 --> 03:23:30,139
There's so many bosses in Dark Souls 2, I don't even remember fighting them.

3368
03:23:30,139 --> 03:23:33,340
It looks alright.

3369
03:23:33,340 --> 03:23:39,590
Oh, this thing was cool.

3370
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:40,590
It was the sentry.

3371
03:23:40,590 --> 03:23:43,780
It has the two bodies.

3372
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:44,780
This fight was good.

3373
03:23:44,780 --> 03:23:51,389
Okay, Ruin Sentinel.

3374
03:23:51,389 --> 03:23:53,190
This is an F. I remember this was stupid.

3375
03:23:53,190 --> 03:23:54,190
I hated this.

3376
03:23:54,190 --> 03:23:58,629
The F, for sure.

3377
03:23:58,670 --> 03:24:02,940
The Ruin Sentinels are absolutely F.

3378
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:04,739
Belfry Gargoyles?

3379
03:24:04,739 --> 03:24:05,920
F.

3380
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:07,520
Is it literally just Dark Souls 1?

3381
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:14,520
Is it F?

3382
03:24:14,520 --> 03:24:17,360
Okay.

3383
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:18,360
The Lost Sinner.

3384
03:24:18,360 --> 03:24:23,590
I didn't even fight this guy.

3385
03:24:23,590 --> 03:24:24,590
He looks...

3386
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:32,510
What about the Skeleton Lords?

3387
03:24:32,510 --> 03:24:33,510
This looks like shit.

3388
03:24:33,510 --> 03:24:34,510
I don't know...

3389
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:35,510
I think this one sucks too.

3390
03:24:35,510 --> 03:24:38,350
What about the...

3391
03:24:38,350 --> 03:24:41,350
What about Slimer from Ghostbusters?

3392
03:24:41,350 --> 03:24:43,190
I actually remember this fight.

3393
03:24:43,190 --> 03:24:44,190
This fight was fun.

3394
03:24:44,190 --> 03:24:46,899
This fight was fun.

3395
03:24:46,899 --> 03:24:47,899
Yup.

3396
03:24:47,899 --> 03:24:53,500
I liked Slimer.

3397
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:54,500
This is probably a C.

3398
03:24:56,950 --> 03:25:03,780
Why do these all look like they're in the same exact area?

3399
03:25:03,780 --> 03:25:05,780
This one actually was pretty good.

3400
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:11,920
That boss is bozo shit.

3401
03:25:11,920 --> 03:25:15,020
This one's pretty good.

3402
03:25:15,020 --> 03:25:20,500
Yeah, I remember the scream and dodging.

3403
03:25:20,500 --> 03:25:21,500
Yup.

3404
03:25:21,500 --> 03:25:23,059
That was fun.

3405
03:25:23,059 --> 03:25:27,920
I'm not seeing any A's that I remember as being like, holy shit, that's an A.

3406
03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:28,920
Smelter Demon.

3407
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:48,139
This is bozo shit right here.

3408
03:25:48,139 --> 03:25:50,139
Oh, I thought he died.

3409
03:25:50,139 --> 03:25:54,559
This is actually cool.

3410
03:25:54,559 --> 03:25:55,559
Yup, I remember this.

3411
03:25:55,559 --> 03:25:59,129
This is probably a B.

3412
03:25:59,129 --> 03:26:01,129
Smelter Demon and Old Iron King.

3413
03:26:01,129 --> 03:26:08,399
This is the fight I'm talking about where you can fall in.

3414
03:26:08,399 --> 03:26:14,610
Yeah, this one sucks.

3415
03:26:14,610 --> 03:26:21,610
D.

3416
03:26:21,610 --> 03:26:23,360
Executioner's Chariot.

3417
03:26:23,360 --> 03:26:26,559
Oh yeah, the Chariot fight.

3418
03:26:26,559 --> 03:26:32,360
Dude, playing Dark Souls 2, it feels like it was a dream.

3419
03:26:32,360 --> 03:26:34,360
I don't remember any of these things.

3420
03:26:34,360 --> 03:26:36,360
And I didn't even play it that long ago.

3421
03:26:36,360 --> 03:26:43,299
Art equals bad.

3422
03:26:43,299 --> 03:26:44,299
Looks like shit.

3423
03:26:44,299 --> 03:26:45,299
Bozo shit.

3424
03:26:45,299 --> 03:26:46,299
Didn't fight him.

3425
03:26:46,299 --> 03:26:54,319
DLC?

3426
03:26:54,319 --> 03:26:55,319
What?

3427
03:26:55,319 --> 03:26:56,319
You should replay it.

3428
03:26:56,319 --> 03:26:57,319
I don't know if I want to.

3429
03:26:57,319 --> 03:26:59,969
I feel like I'll hate it.

3430
03:26:59,969 --> 03:27:00,969
I think it's D.

3431
03:27:00,969 --> 03:27:09,329
I do have a pretty strong memory of this one.

3432
03:27:09,329 --> 03:27:11,629
I think this fight was cool.

3433
03:27:11,629 --> 03:27:14,239
It was probably like a B.

3434
03:27:14,239 --> 03:27:15,239
It was pretty fun.

3435
03:27:15,239 --> 03:27:22,110
Scorpion was kind of like the queen from the first game.

3436
03:27:22,110 --> 03:27:23,350
Yup.

3437
03:27:23,350 --> 03:27:24,350
Royal Rat Authority.

3438
03:27:24,350 --> 03:27:27,700
What?

3439
03:27:27,700 --> 03:27:32,340
That's a dog.

3440
03:27:32,340 --> 03:27:33,340
That's not a rat?

3441
03:27:33,340 --> 03:27:39,299
I thought Royal Rat Authority was a bunch of rats in the room.

3442
03:27:39,299 --> 03:27:44,229
Did I play Dark Souls 2?

3443
03:27:44,229 --> 03:27:47,200
That's the other one.

3444
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:48,200
Oh, okay.

3445
03:27:48,200 --> 03:27:50,819
Well, that's a fun dog.

3446
03:27:50,819 --> 03:27:51,819
Fowling Magus.

3447
03:27:51,819 --> 03:28:02,299
This looks kind of like some Bozo shit right here.

3448
03:28:02,299 --> 03:28:13,620
The Duke's Deer Freya.

3449
03:28:13,620 --> 03:28:16,700
Is this the one with the...

3450
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:17,700
It's the spider.

3451
03:28:17,700 --> 03:28:18,700
Yeah, this one was really scary.

3452
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:26,569
I like the design of this boss.

3453
03:28:26,569 --> 03:28:29,739
This boss needs to be higher than the armor spider.

3454
03:28:29,739 --> 03:28:32,739
Otherwise, I pretended to play this game.

3455
03:28:32,739 --> 03:28:36,219
Which I didn't.

3456
03:28:36,219 --> 03:28:37,219
I beat it like three times.

3457
03:28:37,219 --> 03:28:38,459
Ah, here it is.

3458
03:28:38,459 --> 03:28:39,459
Royal Rat Vanguard.

3459
03:28:39,459 --> 03:28:43,459
I like the room.

3460
03:28:43,459 --> 03:28:45,459
I remember fighting these and the room is cool.

3461
03:28:45,459 --> 03:28:50,870
I'm not going to give it an S because of rats.

3462
03:28:50,870 --> 03:28:52,870
I'll give it probably like a C.

3463
03:28:52,870 --> 03:28:55,010
Rotten.

3464
03:28:55,010 --> 03:29:01,819
Whoa.

3465
03:29:01,819 --> 03:29:02,819
Oh, yeah.

3466
03:29:02,819 --> 03:29:10,069
This fight.

3467
03:29:10,069 --> 03:29:12,069
I mean, it's kind of Bozo, but it's...

3468
03:29:12,069 --> 03:29:14,500
I would say it's probably high.

3469
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:15,500
Not that high.

3470
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:19,959
I'm trying to find the one that I'm like, yeah, yep.

3471
03:29:19,959 --> 03:29:20,959
That one is definitely like A.

3472
03:29:20,959 --> 03:29:25,889
Two Dragon Riders.

3473
03:29:25,889 --> 03:29:26,889
That's not it.

3474
03:29:26,889 --> 03:29:35,319
I don't think that's it.

3475
03:29:35,319 --> 03:29:37,319
I know for a fact a few of these I thought were really good.

3476
03:29:37,319 --> 03:29:40,780
Maybe this is one of them.

3477
03:29:40,780 --> 03:29:41,780
Looking Glass Knight.

3478
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:55,299
I have a distinct memory of this guy's shield and me being like, that was fun.

3479
03:29:55,299 --> 03:30:00,950
Okay.

3480
03:30:00,950 --> 03:30:02,950
I'm looking for one that wows me.

3481
03:30:02,950 --> 03:30:04,510
It's this one.

3482
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:06,510
This is the one with the fucking skull in the mouth of the big frog.

3483
03:30:06,510 --> 03:30:07,510
Yep.

3484
03:30:07,510 --> 03:30:09,510
We finally found at least our B.

3485
03:30:09,510 --> 03:30:17,600
Most people give this an F.

3486
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:22,600
I give this a B because the design is really, really just carries it completely.

3487
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:28,309
Actually, so far, design wise, the only like interesting looking boss in the whole game

3488
03:30:28,309 --> 03:30:29,309
so far.

3489
03:30:29,309 --> 03:30:31,739
Everyone else is kind of just like a...

3490
03:30:31,739 --> 03:30:32,739
Besides the spider.

3491
03:30:32,739 --> 03:30:38,530
I don't know.

3492
03:30:38,530 --> 03:30:39,530
Dark Souls 2 is huge though.

3493
03:30:39,530 --> 03:30:43,819
This is so much content.

3494
03:30:43,819 --> 03:30:45,819
This is the Bell Stat?

3495
03:30:45,819 --> 03:30:46,819
Royal Ages.

3496
03:30:46,819 --> 03:31:01,940
I just don't have any memory of fighting this.

3497
03:31:01,940 --> 03:31:03,940
Dark Souls 2 is just like a billion guys in armor.

3498
03:31:03,940 --> 03:31:08,979
Dark Souls 2 is one of the biggest games they have though.

3499
03:31:08,979 --> 03:31:10,979
So there's a lot of content.

3500
03:31:10,979 --> 03:31:12,149
The areas in Dark Souls 2.

3501
03:31:12,149 --> 03:31:13,149
Some of them are really cool.

3502
03:31:13,149 --> 03:31:15,350
All right.

3503
03:31:15,350 --> 03:31:19,860
He's all right.

3504
03:31:19,860 --> 03:31:20,860
Oh, the dragon in the cage.

3505
03:31:20,860 --> 03:31:21,860
This thing.

3506
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:22,860
Okay.

3507
03:31:22,860 --> 03:31:27,360
This is high.

3508
03:31:27,360 --> 03:31:30,360
This is high because you get to see this from a distance for a while and you go, holy shit.

3509
03:31:30,360 --> 03:31:31,360
Do I actually have to go in there?

3510
03:31:31,360 --> 03:31:33,940
Yeah.

3511
03:31:33,940 --> 03:31:41,690
This is probably at least a B.

3512
03:31:41,690 --> 03:31:42,690
Ancient dragon.

3513
03:31:42,690 --> 03:31:47,379
Oh yeah.

3514
03:31:47,379 --> 03:31:48,379
That's right.

3515
03:31:48,379 --> 03:31:49,379
You can just come up.

3516
03:31:49,379 --> 03:31:50,379
Oh, you can't kill this.

3517
03:31:50,379 --> 03:31:53,139
This takes way too long.

3518
03:31:53,139 --> 03:31:57,040
Don't you have to cheese this fight?

3519
03:31:57,040 --> 03:31:58,040
Isn't this impossible?

3520
03:31:58,040 --> 03:32:19,180
I don't.

3521
03:32:19,180 --> 03:32:21,180
I don't want to just hate on Dark Souls 2.

3522
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:22,180
I really don't.

3523
03:32:22,180 --> 03:32:25,379
I don't want to be like that.

3524
03:32:25,379 --> 03:32:31,930
But doesn't Dark Souls 2 look like it came before Dark Souls 1?

3525
03:32:31,930 --> 03:32:41,399
Is he alive?

3526
03:32:41,399 --> 03:32:44,399
I enjoyed myself a lot in the game.

3527
03:32:44,399 --> 03:32:46,639
I don't want to pretend like I didn't.

3528
03:32:46,639 --> 03:32:49,860
Right?

3529
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:50,860
Giant Lord?

3530
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:57,790
It's so simple to sit here and be like, you know, Dark Souls 2 is the worst one.

3531
03:32:58,790 --> 03:33:03,250
But I mean, do you want more from software content?

3532
03:33:03,250 --> 03:33:05,250
Would you rather this game didn't exist?

3533
03:33:05,250 --> 03:33:08,409
Be honest.

3534
03:33:08,409 --> 03:33:11,799
No, I'll keep it.

3535
03:33:11,799 --> 03:33:13,799
The alternative is this does not exist.

3536
03:33:13,799 --> 03:33:17,469
I remember these giants there.

3537
03:33:17,469 --> 03:33:18,469
They were kind of annoying.

3538
03:33:18,469 --> 03:33:19,649
King Vendrick.

3539
03:33:19,649 --> 03:33:28,379
This one's not bad.

3540
03:33:28,379 --> 03:33:34,579
This is how I got into Dark Souls?

3541
03:33:34,579 --> 03:33:36,399
Yeah.

3542
03:33:36,399 --> 03:33:43,690
So should that be the Dark Souls 2 section of our kind of map where they're all in C

3543
03:33:43,690 --> 03:33:45,690
and they're all in a row?

3544
03:33:45,690 --> 03:33:48,719
None of these are apps.

3545
03:33:48,719 --> 03:33:54,139
You know something?

3546
03:33:54,139 --> 03:34:00,149
Guys, Dark Souls 2 has no S's and has no A's.

3547
03:34:00,149 --> 03:34:07,409
But it also has no F's.

3548
03:34:07,409 --> 03:34:12,100
Interesting.

3549
03:34:12,100 --> 03:34:17,649
I don't remember any of these me being like, this game sucks.

3550
03:34:17,649 --> 03:34:19,649
That's a barometer you need to use.

3551
03:34:19,649 --> 03:34:23,950
Did you fight this enemy and say this game sucks?

3552
03:34:23,950 --> 03:34:24,950
Fix it.

3553
03:34:24,950 --> 03:34:36,780
I'm trying to remember.

3554
03:34:36,780 --> 03:34:42,860
Is this just forgettable?

3555
03:34:42,860 --> 03:34:44,860
I don't remember saying that this game sucks.

3556
03:34:44,860 --> 03:34:45,860
Fix the game.

3557
03:34:45,860 --> 03:34:46,860
The ruined sentinels.

3558
03:34:46,860 --> 03:34:47,860
Yeah, that's right.

3559
03:34:47,860 --> 03:34:53,379
They get one F.

3560
03:34:53,379 --> 03:34:56,379
Don't you feel like you're watching what we're watching in a dream right now?

3561
03:34:56,379 --> 03:34:59,379
Like this is a Dark Souls game that you made up in your head asleep.

3562
03:34:59,379 --> 03:35:05,459
Like the way the animations are and the way that it's being played.

3563
03:35:05,459 --> 03:35:08,459
I feel like I'm dreaming this.

3564
03:35:08,459 --> 03:35:15,780
This is what my brain would put together to say, hey, this is like a Souls game.

3565
03:35:15,780 --> 03:35:20,409
I don't know why.

3566
03:35:20,409 --> 03:35:21,780
Something about it.

3567
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:24,780
It feels like uncanny but real at the same time.

3568
03:35:24,780 --> 03:35:42,090
Oh, this is the first time that I'm going to tell you I remember this a lot and it was really crazy.

3569
03:35:42,090 --> 03:35:46,180
Yep, this is one of the end game bosses.

3570
03:35:46,180 --> 03:35:50,469
This one's actually really cool.

3571
03:35:50,469 --> 03:35:52,100
Is it?

3572
03:35:52,100 --> 03:36:05,940
Do I just want to give Dark Souls 2 like a spot somewhere in A?

3573
03:36:05,940 --> 03:36:07,940
This is literally the final boss before a scholar.

3574
03:36:07,940 --> 03:36:17,360
Oh, is this the guy that looked like Lord Zed and he comes out of the ground?

3575
03:36:17,360 --> 03:36:18,360
It is, right?

3576
03:36:18,360 --> 03:36:20,750
Yep.

3577
03:36:20,750 --> 03:36:33,450
Yep.

3578
03:36:33,450 --> 03:36:36,930
Okay, that's not really good.

3579
03:36:36,930 --> 03:36:37,930
This is an F boss?

3580
03:36:37,930 --> 03:36:43,180
I don't think any of these are F.

3581
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:44,180
I don't.

3582
03:36:44,180 --> 03:36:45,180
I think maybe one of them is.

3583
03:36:45,180 --> 03:36:57,100
Alessandra is an F. That's adorable.

3584
03:36:57,100 --> 03:37:07,090
Compare any of these to Dark Souls 3.

3585
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:11,649
Yeah, but there was a lot of time in between.

3586
03:37:11,649 --> 03:37:13,909
That's kind of cool.

3587
03:37:13,909 --> 03:37:15,409
Grave robbers.

3588
03:37:15,409 --> 03:37:23,420
Why did Dark Souls 2 have so many just put three people in a room fights?

3589
03:37:23,420 --> 03:37:24,420
I don't remember this.

3590
03:37:24,420 --> 03:37:25,420
I would have hated this.

3591
03:37:25,420 --> 03:37:33,040
This is mega F.

3592
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:43,319
Is this fights mega F?

3593
03:37:43,319 --> 03:37:46,069
Is it worse than Bed of Chaos?

3594
03:37:46,069 --> 03:37:54,440
Is this mega F?

3595
03:37:54,440 --> 03:37:55,440
What about the...

3596
03:37:55,440 --> 03:37:58,190
Where's the third person?

3597
03:37:58,190 --> 03:38:03,569
Where's the third player?

3598
03:38:03,569 --> 03:38:10,329
Where's Sarah the old explorer?

3599
03:38:10,329 --> 03:38:20,569
Where's this other person?

3600
03:38:20,569 --> 03:38:22,569
This does seem kind of omega F.

3601
03:38:22,569 --> 03:38:27,620
Okay, where's the third person?

3602
03:38:27,620 --> 03:38:41,049
Alright, what about the slumbering dragon?

3603
03:38:41,049 --> 03:38:46,190
This is cool.

3604
03:38:46,190 --> 03:38:52,739
I played so much Dark Souls 2 and looking back it may have had some of the worst fights.

3605
03:38:52,739 --> 03:38:55,450
Is it that?

3606
03:38:55,450 --> 03:38:56,450
Yeah, this is weird.

3607
03:38:56,450 --> 03:38:57,450
This feels kind of weird.

3608
03:38:57,450 --> 03:38:59,450
I don't remember Dark Souls 2 looking this terrible.

3609
03:38:59,450 --> 03:39:02,739
It wasn't.

3610
03:39:02,739 --> 03:39:03,909
It was fun.

3611
03:39:03,909 --> 03:39:04,909
Like, I liked it.

3612
03:39:04,909 --> 03:39:08,620
It wasn't this bad.

3613
03:39:08,620 --> 03:39:11,399
No.

3614
03:39:11,399 --> 03:39:13,959
No, we're being unfair.

3615
03:39:13,959 --> 03:39:19,340
I think we're being unfair.

3616
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:21,770
This is without seeing the areas.

3617
03:39:21,770 --> 03:39:25,770
Some of Dark Souls 2's areas are really, really cool and really majestic and awesome looking.

3618
03:39:25,770 --> 03:39:28,260
I don't think this is Copium.

3619
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:30,260
I think it was actually a really fun game.

3620
03:39:30,260 --> 03:39:32,659
It was.

3621
03:39:32,659 --> 03:39:35,600
Dark Souls 2 never drops off in quality.

3622
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:37,670
Let me read this.

3623
03:39:37,670 --> 03:39:44,809
Dark Souls 2 never drops off in quality is the second half of Dark Souls 1, you bozos.

3624
03:39:44,809 --> 03:39:50,440
That's actually a good point.

3625
03:39:50,440 --> 03:39:53,440
Like I said, there are not many Fs or Ds.

3626
03:39:53,440 --> 03:39:56,440
It's a bunch of Cs and Bs.

3627
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:58,440
No Ss, no As, no Fs.

3628
03:39:58,440 --> 03:40:04,760
It's very consistent.

3629
03:40:04,760 --> 03:40:07,379
Even Elden Ring.

3630
03:40:07,379 --> 03:40:12,649
The last arc of Elden Ring was alright.

3631
03:40:12,649 --> 03:40:13,649
I mean, that was the whole thing.

3632
03:40:13,649 --> 03:40:16,649
The whole package was an unbelievable masterpiece.

3633
03:40:16,649 --> 03:40:21,690
It's consistently bad.

3634
03:40:21,690 --> 03:40:22,690
I don't think so.

3635
03:40:22,690 --> 03:40:24,860
What about the smelter demon?

3636
03:40:24,860 --> 03:40:30,879
You've already said three Fs.

3637
03:40:30,879 --> 03:40:44,629
Is it the Hollow Knight music in the background that's making this seem dumb?

3638
03:40:44,629 --> 03:40:46,379
I don't know.

3639
03:40:46,379 --> 03:40:47,379
What's going on?

3640
03:40:47,379 --> 03:40:55,379
It might be the music.

3641
03:40:55,379 --> 03:40:57,069
Oh, the Fume Knight.

3642
03:40:57,069 --> 03:40:58,069
I remember the Fume Knight.

3643
03:40:58,069 --> 03:41:05,559
Fume Knight was crazy.

3644
03:41:05,559 --> 03:41:13,620
What's going on with the health in Dark Souls 2?

3645
03:41:13,620 --> 03:41:20,010
What was that?

3646
03:41:20,010 --> 03:41:21,010
What's going on with this health?

3647
03:41:21,010 --> 03:41:31,629
Slow heal.

3648
03:41:31,629 --> 03:41:34,260
I remember this fight was actually pretty crazy.

3649
03:41:34,260 --> 03:41:36,260
I do remember this one.

3650
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:38,260
Sir Alone.

3651
03:41:38,260 --> 03:41:42,379
This was fun too.

3652
03:41:42,379 --> 03:41:51,979
The timings on these were fun.

3653
03:41:51,979 --> 03:41:58,139
You know what it is about Dark Souls 2?

3654
03:41:58,139 --> 03:41:59,139
I figured it out.

3655
03:41:59,139 --> 03:42:01,959
There's no bodies in any of these suits.

3656
03:42:01,959 --> 03:42:04,649
It's all just metal.

3657
03:42:04,649 --> 03:42:05,649
Nobody's alive.

3658
03:42:05,649 --> 03:42:08,649
You're just metal suits attacking each other and clinking into each other.

3659
03:42:08,649 --> 03:42:13,790
Yeah, this fight was fun.

3660
03:42:13,790 --> 03:42:24,209
What about the king's pet?

3661
03:42:24,209 --> 03:42:27,209
Yeah, but if I was craving some Dark Souls, I'd play it.

3662
03:42:27,209 --> 03:42:29,770
It's not a bad game.

3663
03:42:29,770 --> 03:42:34,909
Yeah, this sucked.

3664
03:42:34,909 --> 03:42:39,600
I remember the cat jumping down and then I remember wanting to uninstall the game.

3665
03:42:39,600 --> 03:42:40,600
Why though?

3666
03:42:40,600 --> 03:42:49,180
It's because it's invisible.

3667
03:42:49,180 --> 03:42:56,049
Okay.

3668
03:42:56,049 --> 03:42:58,819
Blood, the king's pet.

3669
03:42:58,819 --> 03:43:00,819
Wait, you need to do it again?

3670
03:43:00,819 --> 03:43:04,110
It's not a bad game.

3671
03:43:04,110 --> 03:43:05,110
Yeah, this sucked.

3672
03:43:05,110 --> 03:43:06,110
I wanted to uninstall it.

3673
03:43:06,110 --> 03:43:07,110
Yeah, but I said...

3674
03:43:07,110 --> 03:43:08,739
Okay.

3675
03:43:08,739 --> 03:43:10,739
How many times did you hear me while I was playing Elden Rings?

3676
03:43:10,739 --> 03:43:11,739
They're saying I wanted to return the game.

3677
03:43:11,739 --> 03:43:15,190
What about the burnt ivory king?

3678
03:43:15,190 --> 03:43:17,709
What's going on?

3679
03:43:17,709 --> 03:43:20,940
Who's the king?

3680
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:29,829
Where's the boss?

3681
03:43:29,829 --> 03:43:34,889
This is just open PVP.

3682
03:43:34,889 --> 03:43:44,549
Bro, somebody said, bro, this is so ugly.

3683
03:43:44,549 --> 03:43:53,100
Everybody's made out of clay and rocks.

3684
03:43:53,100 --> 03:43:54,100
That's what is wrong.

3685
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:56,100
Where's the ivory king?

3686
03:43:56,100 --> 03:44:02,299
Bloodborne is uglier?

3687
03:44:02,299 --> 03:44:04,299
Oh my god, ban that person for life.

3688
03:44:04,299 --> 03:44:05,299
I mean it.

3689
03:44:05,299 --> 03:44:07,299
Ban that person for life.

3690
03:44:07,299 --> 03:44:10,110
Bro, that looked like battle chess.

3691
03:44:10,110 --> 03:44:23,260
Battle chess?

3692
03:44:23,260 --> 03:44:30,020
Oh my god, you just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.

3693
03:44:30,020 --> 03:44:31,020
You just ruined Dark Souls 2.

3694
03:44:31,020 --> 03:44:33,700
I can't even play this again.

3695
03:44:33,700 --> 03:44:34,700
What the fuck?

3696
03:44:34,700 --> 03:44:44,059
Okay, you made me want to put this high though because that's really fun and funny.

3697
03:44:44,059 --> 03:44:46,059
It's a fun game.

3698
03:44:46,059 --> 03:44:47,059
Leave it alone.

3699
03:44:47,059 --> 03:45:02,719
Leave Dark Souls 2 alone, okay?

3700
03:45:02,719 --> 03:45:04,790
It's got...

3701
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:05,790
Listen.

3702
03:45:05,790 --> 03:45:12,440
It's got some of the most content of any of the From Software games.

3703
03:45:12,440 --> 03:45:26,299
It might look like a mobile game ad, but I haven't looked back at Dark Souls 2 in a

3704
03:45:26,299 --> 03:45:27,299
long time.

3705
03:45:27,299 --> 03:45:36,229
You know, if I was a Dark Souls 2 defender right now, you're probably sitting in the

3706
03:45:36,229 --> 03:45:46,149
chat going like, fuck, I am a Dark Souls 2 defender.

3707
03:45:46,149 --> 03:45:50,399
Fume Knight is...

3708
03:45:50,399 --> 03:45:51,399
Fume Knight is...

3709
03:45:51,399 --> 03:45:52,399
Okay, let's do this.

3710
03:45:52,399 --> 03:45:54,700
And then I've got to make sure it's correct.

3711
03:45:54,700 --> 03:45:55,700
This is like 5 hours.

3712
03:45:55,700 --> 03:46:00,649
I'm a Dark Souls 2 defender and I'm malding.

3713
03:46:00,649 --> 03:46:04,950
Come on, that was Battle Chess.

3714
03:46:04,950 --> 03:46:14,989
And everyone's made out of pots and pans.

3715
03:46:14,989 --> 03:46:16,989
I like Dark Souls 2.

3716
03:46:16,989 --> 03:46:18,360
I do.

3717
03:46:18,360 --> 03:46:19,360
I really do.

3718
03:46:19,360 --> 03:46:20,360
It might be...

3719
03:46:20,360 --> 03:46:25,430
Fuck, it's literally at the bottom of my list, but they're all good.

3720
03:46:25,430 --> 03:46:26,430
Alright, let's do it.

3721
03:46:26,430 --> 03:46:27,930
Fume Knight.

3722
03:46:27,930 --> 03:46:35,840
Let's put the ones we know that are high, high.

3723
03:46:35,840 --> 03:46:37,840
Is Fume Knight cooler than the Taurus Demon?

3724
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:41,510
Where is our...

3725
03:46:41,510 --> 03:46:42,510
Where's the Barometer?

3726
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:43,510
It's Godfrey, right?

3727
03:46:43,510 --> 03:46:45,510
Is Fume Knight better than Godfrey?

3728
03:46:45,510 --> 03:46:54,409
You know, I think so.

3729
03:46:54,409 --> 03:46:58,379
I actually think so.

3730
03:46:58,379 --> 03:46:59,620
I do.

3731
03:46:59,620 --> 03:47:18,610
I even think Fume Knight is better than the Bloodstarve Beast, but that's where it ends.

3732
03:47:18,610 --> 03:47:19,610
We gotta give it to him, guys.

3733
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:24,610
We gotta give him at least one encounter that's over the C-minus threshold.

3734
03:47:24,610 --> 03:47:30,389
I'm not done.

3735
03:47:30,389 --> 03:47:34,190
What...

3736
03:47:34,190 --> 03:47:35,190
Any of these...

3737
03:47:35,190 --> 03:47:36,190
Where's the...

3738
03:47:36,190 --> 03:47:37,190
Where's that fight right here?

3739
03:47:37,190 --> 03:47:39,190
War into Ivory King is fucking high.

3740
03:47:39,190 --> 03:47:40,559
Okay?

3741
03:47:40,559 --> 03:47:42,559
It's really high, because that was hilarious.

3742
03:47:42,559 --> 03:47:47,930
And comedy sometimes trumps gameplay a lot of the time.

3743
03:47:47,930 --> 03:47:51,170
Comedy can make gameplay look stupid.

3744
03:47:51,170 --> 03:47:56,170
I'm telling you right now, that Battle Chess comment makes this funner than the Elden Beast.

3745
03:47:56,170 --> 03:48:11,899
I would have more fun walking around hitting those guys and watching them play Battle Chess

3746
03:48:11,899 --> 03:48:18,579
than doing the Radagon-Elden Beast combo again.

3747
03:48:18,579 --> 03:48:24,270
I think that's okay being there.

3748
03:48:24,270 --> 03:48:29,180
Watch the intro to the Burned Ivory King.

3749
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:54,350
Why?

3750
03:48:54,350 --> 03:49:00,459
Okay.

3751
03:49:00,459 --> 03:49:01,459
This stays there.

3752
03:49:01,459 --> 03:49:17,700
I love this.

3753
03:49:17,700 --> 03:49:18,700
This is...

3754
03:49:18,700 --> 03:49:19,700
I love this.

3755
03:49:19,700 --> 03:49:25,200
It reminds me of the boys.

3756
03:49:25,200 --> 03:49:27,399
It does.

3757
03:49:27,399 --> 03:49:28,399
Some of them are standing still.

3758
03:49:28,399 --> 03:49:29,399
Do you see?

3759
03:49:29,399 --> 03:49:32,829
That guy just drank a potion and he didn't get hit.

3760
03:49:32,829 --> 03:49:33,829
Yup.

3761
03:49:33,829 --> 03:49:37,180
I'm...

3762
03:49:37,180 --> 03:49:38,180
Comedy trumps all sometimes.

3763
03:49:38,180 --> 03:49:43,299
Sometimes comedy trumps all.

3764
03:49:43,299 --> 03:49:44,299
And that's where it belongs.

3765
03:49:44,299 --> 03:49:49,260
It's not...

3766
03:49:49,260 --> 03:49:50,260
I'm not giving it an S.

3767
03:49:50,260 --> 03:49:51,260
In fact, it's going here.

3768
03:49:51,260 --> 03:49:55,500
It's staying...

3769
03:49:55,500 --> 03:49:56,500
Okay.

3770
03:49:56,500 --> 03:49:57,500
Alright.

3771
03:49:57,500 --> 03:50:08,340
It's staying right here.

3772
03:50:08,340 --> 03:50:09,340
I don't...

3773
03:50:09,340 --> 03:50:10,340
Okay.

3774
03:50:10,340 --> 03:50:11,340
The Chariot is D.

3775
03:50:11,340 --> 03:50:12,899
That sucked.

3776
03:50:12,899 --> 03:50:13,899
Skeleton Lords was D.

3777
03:50:13,899 --> 03:50:17,850
The Slimer Demon is D.

3778
03:50:17,850 --> 03:50:21,389
C.

3779
03:50:21,389 --> 03:50:23,389
The Medusa Fight was actually pretty cool.

3780
03:50:23,389 --> 03:50:24,569
High C.

3781
03:50:24,569 --> 03:50:30,459
I don't think that's cooler than Godfrey though.

3782
03:50:30,459 --> 03:50:31,459
Old Iron King.

3783
03:50:31,459 --> 03:50:32,459
I forgot what it was already.

3784
03:50:32,459 --> 03:50:33,760
Smelter Demon.

3785
03:50:33,760 --> 03:50:36,379
I forgot what it was.

3786
03:50:36,379 --> 03:50:37,379
Rotten.

3787
03:50:37,379 --> 03:50:39,260
This one was...

3788
03:50:39,260 --> 03:50:40,260
This one was kind of fun.

3789
03:50:40,260 --> 03:50:44,319
This is like another Slimer.

3790
03:50:44,319 --> 03:50:45,319
Demon of Song.

3791
03:50:45,319 --> 03:50:51,940
Oh.

3792
03:50:51,940 --> 03:50:52,940
The music turned off.

3793
03:50:52,940 --> 03:50:54,940
That was weird.

3794
03:50:54,940 --> 03:50:57,139
Oh.

3795
03:50:57,139 --> 03:50:58,139
The music turned off.

3796
03:50:58,139 --> 03:50:59,139
Video paused.

3797
03:50:59,139 --> 03:51:00,139
Are you still watching?

3798
03:51:00,139 --> 03:51:04,200
Continue watching.

3799
03:51:04,200 --> 03:51:05,440
Thanks for confirming.

3800
03:51:05,440 --> 03:51:06,440
Did I just get Netflixed?

3801
03:51:06,440 --> 03:51:09,920
I gotta go.

3802
03:51:09,920 --> 03:51:15,659
I've been sitting here for like so long.

3803
03:51:15,659 --> 03:51:16,659
Okay.

3804
03:51:16,659 --> 03:51:17,659
I want the Demon of Song.

3805
03:51:17,659 --> 03:51:24,930
It's definitely not cooler than any of the Sekiro fights.

3806
03:51:24,930 --> 03:51:26,930
Is there a Sekiro fight that's...

3807
03:51:26,930 --> 03:51:29,829
Yeah.

3808
03:51:29,829 --> 03:51:30,829
Okay.

3809
03:51:30,829 --> 03:51:34,739
You can stay down here.

3810
03:51:34,739 --> 03:51:38,700
The Scorpion was pretty cool.

3811
03:51:38,700 --> 03:51:39,700
C.

3812
03:51:39,700 --> 03:51:41,579
Royal Rat Authority.

3813
03:51:41,579 --> 03:51:42,579
I mean, everyone was laughing at that.

3814
03:51:42,579 --> 03:51:45,579
It was like a Scooby Doo dog with a tongue hanging out.

3815
03:51:45,579 --> 03:51:46,579
I didn't even fight this.

3816
03:51:46,579 --> 03:51:51,299
I was gonna put it down here.

3817
03:51:51,299 --> 03:51:53,299
Rattling Magus and Congregation.

3818
03:51:53,299 --> 03:51:55,299
I don't remember fighting this.

3819
03:51:55,299 --> 03:51:56,860
The Last Giant.

3820
03:51:56,860 --> 03:51:57,860
That's the first boss in the game.

3821
03:51:57,860 --> 03:51:59,860
I'm gonna give it a good low C.

3822
03:51:59,860 --> 03:52:03,260
Duke's Deer Freya.

3823
03:52:03,260 --> 03:52:04,260
That one was not that bad.

3824
03:52:04,260 --> 03:52:07,649
Probably like a high low C.

3825
03:52:07,649 --> 03:52:09,950
Twin Dragon Riders is a low C.

3826
03:52:09,950 --> 03:52:11,129
Looking Glass Knight.

3827
03:52:11,129 --> 03:52:12,129
That's a high C.

3828
03:52:12,129 --> 03:52:15,200
Not better than Fume Knight.

3829
03:52:15,200 --> 03:52:16,200
Not better than Godfrey.

3830
03:52:16,200 --> 03:52:20,899
The Royal Aegis.

3831
03:52:20,899 --> 03:52:21,899
This one was pretty cool.

3832
03:52:21,899 --> 03:52:24,989
Low B.

3833
03:52:24,989 --> 03:52:25,989
No.

3834
03:52:25,989 --> 03:52:27,549
High C before Godfrey.

3835
03:52:27,549 --> 03:52:29,559
Fendrik.

3836
03:52:29,559 --> 03:52:30,559
This was a D.

3837
03:52:30,559 --> 03:52:31,559
No.

3838
03:52:31,559 --> 03:52:32,559
This is a low C.

3839
03:52:32,559 --> 03:52:35,079
Ancient Dragon F.

3840
03:52:35,079 --> 03:52:38,340
Guardian Dragon is like a C.

3841
03:52:38,340 --> 03:52:42,670
Giant Lord is like a C.

3842
03:52:42,670 --> 03:52:44,940
Dark Lurker.

3843
03:52:44,940 --> 03:52:47,940
I don't think I fought this.

3844
03:52:47,940 --> 03:52:49,500
Pursuer.

3845
03:52:49,500 --> 03:52:50,500
Pursuer was pretty fun.

3846
03:52:50,500 --> 03:52:51,500
It was pretty challenging.

3847
03:52:51,500 --> 03:52:52,500
I'll give it a C.

3848
03:52:52,500 --> 03:52:56,340
Throne Watcher and Throne Defender.

3849
03:52:56,340 --> 03:52:57,340
I'll give it a C.

3850
03:52:57,340 --> 03:52:58,340
Machandra.

3851
03:52:58,340 --> 03:53:04,739
I'll give it a C.

3852
03:53:06,239 --> 03:53:07,239
Fowler of the First Sin.

3853
03:53:07,239 --> 03:53:09,239
That's the funny guy that's in the ground.

3854
03:53:09,239 --> 03:53:11,379
I'll give it a C.

3855
03:53:11,379 --> 03:53:12,379
Grave Robbers.

3856
03:53:12,379 --> 03:53:13,379
Everyone said give that an F.

3857
03:53:13,379 --> 03:53:19,379
I don't even remember fighting it.

3858
03:53:19,379 --> 03:53:22,379
Dragon Rider has comedy points because you can make them fall off the edge.

3859
03:53:22,379 --> 03:53:23,379
And that's pretty cool.

3860
03:53:23,379 --> 03:53:24,620
I like that.

3861
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:28,030
B.

3862
03:53:28,030 --> 03:53:30,030
The Queen was pretty cool.

3863
03:53:30,030 --> 03:53:32,739
I'll give it a C.

3864
03:53:32,739 --> 03:53:34,739
Flumbering Dragon was pretty cool.

3865
03:53:34,739 --> 03:53:35,739
I'll give it a high C.

3866
03:53:35,739 --> 03:53:38,520
Smelter Demon.

3867
03:53:38,520 --> 03:53:39,520
I'll give it a C.

3868
03:53:39,520 --> 03:53:42,229
Sir Alone.

3869
03:53:42,229 --> 03:53:44,229
This one was pretty cool.

3870
03:53:44,229 --> 03:53:45,229
I'll give it a C.

3871
03:53:45,229 --> 03:53:47,559
King's Pet F.

3872
03:53:47,559 --> 03:53:49,059
King's Pet F.

3873
03:53:49,059 --> 03:53:54,219
I actually like this boss that's going high.

3874
03:53:54,219 --> 03:53:58,500
The design of this boss alone is cool.

3875
03:53:58,500 --> 03:54:00,870
It is cooler than Godfrey.

3876
03:54:00,870 --> 03:54:03,969
Where's Godfrey?

3877
03:54:03,969 --> 03:54:06,979
It's cooler than Godfrey, for sure.

3878
03:54:06,979 --> 03:54:09,540
Where the fuck is Godfrey?

3879
03:54:09,540 --> 03:54:13,719
Where's Godfrey?

3880
03:54:13,719 --> 03:54:16,920
Oh wow, you're way higher than Godfrey.

3881
03:54:16,920 --> 03:54:24,979
You're cooler than the Godskin Noble.

3882
03:54:24,979 --> 03:54:25,979
They overdid this.

3883
03:54:25,979 --> 03:54:26,979
I'm putting it down.

3884
03:54:26,979 --> 03:54:31,620
Dragon Slayer.

3885
03:54:31,620 --> 03:54:32,620
I'm going to give it a C.

3886
03:54:32,620 --> 03:54:36,479
Gargoyles D.

3887
03:54:36,479 --> 03:54:39,809
Ruin Sentinels F.

3888
03:54:39,809 --> 03:54:42,750
Lost Sinner.

3889
03:54:42,750 --> 03:54:44,180
I'm going to give it a C.

3890
03:54:44,180 --> 03:54:45,180
Royal Rat Vanguard.

3891
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:47,579
Royal Rat Vanguard.

3892
03:54:47,579 --> 03:54:48,579
I'm going to give it a D.

3893
03:54:48,579 --> 03:54:50,579
Well no, I'll give it a C.

3894
03:54:50,579 --> 03:54:53,540
Okay.

3895
03:54:53,540 --> 03:55:15,100
I've got to get this right.

3896
03:55:15,100 --> 03:55:16,100
Top row is done.

3897
03:55:16,100 --> 03:55:49,530
Now it is.

3898
03:55:49,530 --> 03:55:51,530
I need silence for this because this is really important.

3899
03:55:51,530 --> 03:55:56,049
This is the thing people are going to point to to say that I'm like a piece of shit for

3900
03:55:56,049 --> 03:55:57,049
the rest of my life.

3901
03:55:57,049 --> 03:55:58,049
I have to make sure this is correct.

3902
03:55:58,049 --> 03:56:11,020
This is one of the most important things I've ever done on stream because some of you after

3903
03:56:11,020 --> 03:56:14,020
this are going to hate me for the rest of your life.

3904
03:56:14,020 --> 03:56:16,260
I've got to see what happens here.

3905
03:56:16,260 --> 03:56:20,860
Is Gas Coin better than...

3906
03:56:20,860 --> 03:56:22,549
No.

3907
03:56:22,549 --> 03:56:23,549
This was a cooler fight.

3908
03:56:23,549 --> 03:56:30,399
Sullivan cooler than Gas Coin.

3909
03:56:30,399 --> 03:56:32,090
Yeah.

3910
03:56:32,090 --> 03:56:35,670
Ibritos cooler than Gas Coin.

3911
03:56:35,670 --> 03:56:38,700
No.

3912
03:56:38,700 --> 03:56:41,069
Any of these cooler than Ibritos.

3913
03:56:41,069 --> 03:56:44,739
Yes.

3914
03:56:44,739 --> 03:56:58,850
Yes.

3915
03:56:58,850 --> 03:57:00,850
Bloodborne is losing a lot of ground here.

3916
03:57:00,850 --> 03:57:01,850
It's Dark Souls 3.

3917
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:02,850
No.

3918
03:57:02,850 --> 03:57:03,850
No.

3919
03:57:03,850 --> 03:57:04,850
Sekiro sucks.

3920
03:57:04,850 --> 03:57:49,709
I refuse to give it a S.

3921
03:57:49,709 --> 03:57:51,659
I'm kidding.

3922
03:57:51,659 --> 03:58:05,379
It's fine.

3923
03:58:05,379 --> 03:58:06,379
Dark Souls 2.

3924
03:58:06,379 --> 03:58:20,159
I don't think I can move any of these.

3925
03:58:20,159 --> 03:58:23,159
B is just as important as A though because some of these might have to level up.

3926
03:58:23,159 --> 03:58:34,770
No.

3927
03:58:34,770 --> 03:58:35,770
No.

3928
03:58:35,770 --> 03:58:37,520
No.

3929
03:58:37,520 --> 03:58:41,700
No.

3930
03:58:41,700 --> 03:58:45,100
No.

3931
03:58:45,100 --> 03:58:47,049
Yes.

3932
03:58:47,049 --> 03:59:11,709
Yes.

3933
03:59:11,709 --> 03:59:13,909
Yes.

3934
03:59:13,909 --> 03:59:14,909
And fuck Raikar too.

3935
03:59:14,909 --> 03:59:18,069
Dancer is cooler than Mog.

3936
03:59:18,069 --> 03:59:19,069
You know what?

3937
03:59:19,069 --> 03:59:25,180
So is Isshin and so is...

3938
03:59:25,180 --> 03:59:30,979
Shaping Dragon is not cooler than any of these.

3939
03:59:30,979 --> 03:59:56,979
What is this doing up here?

3940
03:59:56,979 --> 03:59:57,979
The music in this is so good.

3941
03:59:57,979 --> 04:00:06,950
I think Wet Nurse goes down below Tree Sentinel.

3942
04:00:06,950 --> 04:00:10,950
That was just such an insane awesome moment when you open up the door and Limgrave is there

3943
04:00:10,950 --> 04:00:11,950
and there's the Tree Sentinel.

3944
04:00:11,950 --> 04:00:13,950
It's like wow the graphics.

3945
04:00:13,950 --> 04:00:14,950
I can...

3946
04:00:14,950 --> 04:01:03,420
Wow.

3947
04:01:03,420 --> 04:01:04,420
Shit.

3948
04:01:04,420 --> 04:01:11,549
Sekiro is way better than I thought it was.

3949
04:01:13,110 --> 04:01:19,319
Thank you for the correction you're right.

3950
04:01:19,319 --> 04:01:21,899
Is this good?

3951
04:01:21,899 --> 04:01:28,969
Is B good?

3952
04:01:28,969 --> 04:01:29,969
This fight didn't last long enough.

3953
04:01:29,969 --> 04:01:30,969
It would have been A.

3954
04:01:30,969 --> 04:01:34,040
It just was a massive DPS raise.

3955
04:01:34,040 --> 04:01:55,840
These are like the same kind of fight and this one was cooler by far.

3956
04:01:55,840 --> 04:01:59,809
This is cooler than this.

3957
04:01:59,809 --> 04:02:02,649
Cooler than that too.

3958
04:02:02,649 --> 04:02:04,909
No it's not.

3959
04:02:04,909 --> 04:02:12,620
Vort's way too high.

3960
04:02:12,620 --> 04:02:18,670
Vort and Wulner make sense at the same spot.

3961
04:02:18,670 --> 04:02:24,430
Gundyr is in the wrong spot as well.

3962
04:02:24,430 --> 04:02:25,739
But cooler than this.

3963
04:02:25,739 --> 04:02:28,000
These are way too high.

3964
04:02:28,000 --> 04:02:29,940
Way too high.

3965
04:02:29,940 --> 04:02:47,889
I think this is too low.

3966
04:02:47,889 --> 04:03:05,180
I think that's in a perfect spot.

3967
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:08,020
Okay.

3968
04:03:08,020 --> 04:03:09,020
Um.

3969
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:10,020
Dark Souls 2.

3970
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:12,280
Oh okay.

3971
04:03:12,280 --> 04:03:13,280
Everything in Dark Souls.

3972
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:18,280
Is every single boss in Dark Souls 2 that's not the ones I put high better than the Taurus

3973
04:03:18,280 --> 04:03:27,260
Demon?

3974
04:03:27,260 --> 04:03:28,260
I mean I don't know about that.

3975
04:03:28,260 --> 04:03:35,709
Put these down.

3976
04:03:35,709 --> 04:03:37,909
Put this up.

3977
04:03:37,909 --> 04:03:40,280
All the Dark Souls 3 stuff goes up now.

3978
04:03:40,280 --> 04:03:42,540
Except for this.

3979
04:03:42,540 --> 04:03:44,620
Cleric Beast goes down.

3980
04:03:44,620 --> 04:03:45,620
Fuck this fight.

3981
04:03:45,620 --> 04:03:46,620
Stupid.

3982
04:03:46,620 --> 04:03:50,100
It's the worst fight in the whole game.

3983
04:03:50,100 --> 04:03:51,100
But it's better than everything in Dark Souls 2.

3984
04:03:51,100 --> 04:03:53,620
Hold on.

3985
04:03:53,620 --> 04:03:58,399
I gotta make sure I do this right.

3986
04:03:58,399 --> 04:04:00,399
Dark Souls 2 is like the C.

3987
04:04:00,399 --> 04:04:05,950
No that can stay there.

3988
04:04:05,950 --> 04:04:06,950
So can that.

3989
04:04:06,950 --> 04:04:07,950
And so can this.

3990
04:04:07,950 --> 04:04:18,979
The gold skin duo is bad.

3991
04:04:18,979 --> 04:04:19,979
These are cooler than the Taurus Demon.

3992
04:04:19,979 --> 04:04:20,979
They are.

3993
04:04:20,979 --> 04:04:22,979
Old King is cooler than the Taurus Demon as well.

3994
04:04:22,979 --> 04:04:23,979
Way cooler.

3995
04:04:23,979 --> 04:04:30,280
I'm swapping these.

3996
04:04:30,280 --> 04:04:31,280
Moon Presence has to come way down.

3997
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:47,500
Fuck.

3998
04:04:47,500 --> 04:04:48,500
This is too high.

3999
04:04:48,500 --> 04:04:56,239
I think that's in a good spot.

4000
04:04:56,239 --> 04:05:00,450
Seath the Scaleless sucks.

4001
04:05:00,450 --> 04:05:03,219
Um.

4002
04:05:03,219 --> 04:05:04,219
But it's cooler than Godfrey.

4003
04:05:04,219 --> 04:05:06,219
And it's cooler than the old hero.

4004
04:05:06,219 --> 04:05:09,360
Is it cooler than the Fume Knight?

4005
04:05:09,360 --> 04:05:10,659
I'll say yes.

4006
04:05:17,790 --> 04:05:24,440
But the really important one is what is the worst fucking thing I've done ever in a From Software game?

4007
04:05:24,440 --> 04:05:31,100
I think that's good.

4008
04:05:31,100 --> 04:05:37,430
These are all the same to me.

4009
04:05:37,430 --> 04:05:38,430
That's where it belongs.

4010
04:05:38,430 --> 04:05:39,430
To me.

4011
04:05:39,430 --> 04:05:40,430
And I have to be honest.

4012
04:05:40,430 --> 04:05:45,260
Okay.

4013
04:05:45,260 --> 04:05:49,540
What's the worst thing I've ever done.

4014
04:05:49,540 --> 04:05:50,540
Ever.

4015
04:05:50,540 --> 04:05:52,540
In a From Software game.

4016
04:05:52,540 --> 04:05:56,860
This is pretty low.

4017
04:05:56,860 --> 04:05:59,540
It's always bed of chaos.

4018
04:05:59,540 --> 04:06:03,829
I hated this so much though.

4019
04:06:03,829 --> 04:06:04,829
I did.

4020
04:06:04,829 --> 04:06:05,829
I hated it.

4021
04:06:05,829 --> 04:06:06,829
This is probably worse.

4022
04:06:06,829 --> 04:06:08,200
And so is this.

4023
04:06:08,200 --> 04:06:09,200
These are probably worse than that as well.

4024
04:06:09,200 --> 04:06:11,500
Dragon God is worse than that.

4025
04:06:11,500 --> 04:06:13,319
The Grave Robber shit.

4026
04:06:13,319 --> 04:06:14,319
I mean it's bad.

4027
04:06:14,319 --> 04:06:16,319
These are all bad.

4028
04:06:16,319 --> 04:06:17,319
Ruin Sentinels are bad.

4029
04:06:17,319 --> 04:06:18,319
Probably the worst.

4030
04:06:18,319 --> 04:06:19,319
No.

4031
04:06:19,319 --> 04:06:20,319
Maybe.

4032
04:06:20,319 --> 04:06:21,319
They might be.

4033
04:06:21,319 --> 04:06:22,319
It's possible.

4034
04:06:22,319 --> 04:06:23,319
Deacons could be the worst.

4035
04:06:23,319 --> 04:07:15,299
Is it done?

4036
04:07:15,299 --> 04:07:18,299
Millennia is better than the fucking goddamn Skeleton Lords.

4037
04:07:18,299 --> 04:07:19,299
Right?

4038
04:07:19,299 --> 04:07:21,750
Like I gotta be fair.

4039
04:07:21,750 --> 04:07:22,750
I'm trying to think.

4040
04:07:22,750 --> 04:07:27,129
Is better than.

4041
04:07:27,129 --> 04:07:28,129
Millennia is better than Pinwheel.

4042
04:07:28,129 --> 04:07:29,129
Pinwheel will come back.

4043
04:07:29,129 --> 04:07:30,430
Pinwheel will go to F.

4044
04:07:30,430 --> 04:07:44,340
I refuse to put it higher than D.

4045
04:07:44,340 --> 04:07:46,340
I just hated that fight so much.

4046
04:07:46,340 --> 04:07:50,350
Lady Butterfly is only there because it prevents me from playing the game anymore.

4047
04:07:50,350 --> 04:07:54,579
It's an encounter you have to do.

4048
04:07:54,579 --> 04:07:58,059
Done.

4049
04:07:58,059 --> 04:07:59,059
Stamp it.

4050
04:07:59,059 --> 04:08:00,299
Sign it.

4051
04:08:00,299 --> 04:08:02,500
Done.

4052
04:08:02,500 --> 04:08:03,500
It's over.

4053
04:08:03,500 --> 04:08:05,500
All these are mini bosses or stuff that I can't really place.

4054
04:08:05,500 --> 04:08:11,200
It's over.

4055
04:08:11,200 --> 04:08:12,200
What about Morgoth?

4056
04:08:12,200 --> 04:08:23,079
Yeah, I made the joke about how I can't place Morgoth, but I'll place him.

4057
04:08:23,079 --> 04:08:28,930
It's cool.

4058
04:08:28,930 --> 04:08:30,100
There you are.

4059
04:08:30,100 --> 04:08:33,010
It's over.

4060
04:08:33,010 --> 04:08:36,010
There is my official From Software boss tier list.

4061
04:08:36,010 --> 04:08:38,010
It only took us about 5 hours.

4062
04:08:38,010 --> 04:08:40,139
Butterfly is optional.

4063
04:08:40,139 --> 04:08:41,139
You're a dumbass.

4064
04:08:41,139 --> 04:08:56,030
So what game do I like the most?

4065
04:08:56,030 --> 04:08:57,659
Okay.

4066
04:08:57,659 --> 04:09:03,540
We're going to count how many bosses are in S, A, or B.

4067
04:09:03,540 --> 04:09:04,540
Let's start with Bloodborne.

4068
04:09:04,540 --> 04:09:05,840
It's right here.

4069
04:09:05,840 --> 04:09:14,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

4070
04:09:14,280 --> 04:09:18,219
There are nine bosses here from Bloodborne.

4071
04:09:18,219 --> 04:09:28,129
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

4072
04:09:28,129 --> 04:09:30,129
those are Demon's Souls.

4073
04:09:30,129 --> 04:09:37,180
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen from Elden Ring.

4074
04:09:37,180 --> 04:09:39,620
Dark Souls 3.

4075
04:09:39,620 --> 04:09:51,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

4076
04:09:51,280 --> 04:09:57,229
Twelve versus fourteen.

4077
04:09:57,229 --> 04:10:01,159
And there are way more bosses.

4078
04:10:01,159 --> 04:10:07,110
Way more bosses in Elden Ring.

4079
04:10:07,110 --> 04:10:10,420
Dark Souls 3 might be my favorite one.

4080
04:10:10,420 --> 04:10:20,420
Boss encounters wise, if we're just talking straight up boss fights, I think Dark Souls

4081
04:10:20,420 --> 04:10:22,850
3 has the best boss fights.

4082
04:10:22,850 --> 04:10:28,090
Below that, I think Bloodborne and Elden Ring both kind of are tied for me in boss encounters.

4083
04:10:28,090 --> 04:10:34,680
Although I think Bloodborne edges it a little bit more.

4084
04:10:34,680 --> 04:10:40,120
Dark Souls 3 is baby easy.

4085
04:10:40,120 --> 04:10:51,059
And Sekiro though, five, six, seven, there are nine.

4086
04:10:51,059 --> 04:10:55,360
I liked Sekiro, apparently, the boss fights as much as I liked Bloodborne.

4087
04:10:55,360 --> 04:10:57,920
Kind of, right?

4088
04:10:57,920 --> 04:11:09,889
I guess I'm surprising myself that I actually did sort of like that game.

4089
04:11:09,889 --> 04:11:10,889
What about the F's?

4090
04:11:10,889 --> 04:11:11,889
This is important too.

4091
04:11:11,889 --> 04:11:17,969
Holy shit, I don't give a fuck about Dark Souls 1 at all.

4092
04:11:17,969 --> 04:11:27,870
One, two, what about the D's and F's?

4093
04:11:27,870 --> 04:11:31,870
Lots of Dark Souls 1 and D. A lot.

4094
04:11:31,870 --> 04:11:34,649
Damn.

4095
04:11:34,649 --> 04:11:43,100
Huh.

4096
04:11:43,100 --> 04:11:50,110
If you take the aggregate, I think Dark Souls 2 has a better score than Dark Souls 1 on

4097
04:11:50,110 --> 04:11:53,659
this tier list.

4098
04:11:53,659 --> 04:11:58,299
I mean, there's way more Dark Souls 2 bosses, that's not fair.

4099
04:11:58,299 --> 04:12:00,299
Lot of Elden Ring and D as well though.

4100
04:12:00,299 --> 04:12:08,739
There was like a fucking hundred of them.

4101
04:12:08,739 --> 04:12:13,920
Alright, that's cool.

4102
04:12:13,920 --> 04:12:16,159
I still think my opinion stands.

4103
04:12:16,159 --> 04:12:19,870
That's Demon's Souls, oh right, not Elden Ring.

4104
04:12:19,870 --> 04:12:21,870
Dark Souls 1 unironically sucks.

4105
04:12:21,870 --> 04:12:23,870
It was just better than Demon's Souls.

4106
04:12:23,870 --> 04:12:27,870
I actually liked Demon's Souls better than Dark Souls 1 because you could fast travel.

4107
04:12:27,870 --> 04:12:32,870
Wait until like two thirds plus more than halfway through the game to travel in Dark

4108
04:12:32,870 --> 04:12:41,469
Souls 1.

4109
04:12:41,469 --> 04:12:51,520
I think that Dark Souls 1 is way higher than am I lying to you?

4110
04:12:51,520 --> 04:13:02,000
If you told me right now, would you rather start playing Dark Souls 1 right now or Sekiro?

4111
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:15,950
I would probably say Sekiro.

4112
04:13:15,950 --> 04:13:19,790
Yeah, I think so.

4113
04:13:19,790 --> 04:13:24,790
Part of that I think has to do with the fact that I have played through Dark Souls 1 like

4114
04:13:24,790 --> 04:13:25,790
five to ten times.

4115
04:13:25,790 --> 04:13:31,139
I've only played through Sekiro once, so that's probably one of the reasons why.

4116
04:13:31,139 --> 04:13:43,379
Dark Souls 1 is just a solid video game that kind of, it was right after Demon's Souls

4117
04:13:43,379 --> 04:13:46,379
was cool and everybody was like wow that's a cool concept.

4118
04:13:46,379 --> 04:13:49,379
They made Dark Souls 1 this interconnected world.

4119
04:13:49,379 --> 04:13:51,559
It was a cool experience.

4120
04:13:51,559 --> 04:13:53,559
It was unlike anything else anyone ever played.

4121
04:13:53,559 --> 04:13:56,440
It's just old.

4122
04:13:56,440 --> 04:13:58,450
Older.

4123
04:13:58,450 --> 04:14:03,819
And it's hard to put it above stuff that came ten years later from the same company

4124
04:14:03,819 --> 04:14:05,819
that is effectively the same video games.

4125
04:14:05,819 --> 04:14:12,100
And even still, like somebody just said, it is unlike anything else still because they

4126
04:14:12,100 --> 04:14:16,100
got rid of the interconnected world where you run from place to place and you don't

4127
04:14:16,100 --> 04:14:17,100
fast travel.

4128
04:14:17,100 --> 04:14:18,100
They got rid of that.

4129
04:14:18,100 --> 04:14:21,649
Sekiro's level design was really good.

4130
04:14:21,649 --> 04:14:22,649
It was.

4131
04:14:22,649 --> 04:14:28,190
Maybe I unnecessarily hate Sekiro for no reason.

4132
04:14:28,190 --> 04:14:30,190
Maybe it was just hard.

4133
04:14:30,190 --> 04:14:35,250
I remember crying.

4134
04:14:35,250 --> 04:14:51,670
If Millenia didn't have the one bullshit move, where would she be?

4135
04:14:51,670 --> 04:15:02,620
We have to live in reality.

4136
04:15:02,620 --> 04:15:07,750
Waterfall is fine laughing my ass up.

4137
04:15:07,750 --> 04:15:19,370
When you make your tier list, you can put Millenia, Blade of Mykola, up here.

4138
04:15:19,370 --> 04:15:27,549
But there's no chance in hell that Millenia is cooler than Gehrman that's not happening.

4139
04:15:27,549 --> 04:15:29,920
Nameless King, not happening.

4140
04:15:29,920 --> 04:15:31,920
Inichiro, not happening.

4141
04:15:31,920 --> 04:15:34,739
Seed, not happening.

4142
04:15:34,739 --> 04:15:40,219
Pontiff Sullivan, not happening.

4143
04:15:40,219 --> 04:15:43,780
Better than Legarius, not happening.

4144
04:15:43,780 --> 04:15:46,860
Better than Abyss Watchers, I'll give you that.

4145
04:15:46,860 --> 04:15:49,860
Better than Ornstein and Smog, not happening.

4146
04:15:49,860 --> 04:15:59,350
This is really unfair.

4147
04:15:59,350 --> 04:16:05,059
I'm just mad at this because I just did it and I hated it.

4148
04:16:05,059 --> 04:16:09,059
Give me like two months, ask me again, and she'll probably be up here.

4149
04:16:09,059 --> 04:16:13,860
Ornstein and Smog, overrated.

4150
04:16:13,860 --> 04:16:16,100
A lot of people think I have this underrated.

4151
04:16:16,100 --> 04:16:20,389
I thought I put it in a good place.

4152
04:16:20,389 --> 04:16:22,389
This is a good tier list, not happening.

4153
04:16:22,389 --> 04:16:34,079
We're not doing this again.

4154
04:16:34,079 --> 04:16:37,149
That was fun though.

4155
04:16:37,149 --> 04:16:39,149
That was just chilling, just doing this.

4156
04:16:39,149 --> 04:16:41,709
What a weird stream.

4157
04:16:41,709 --> 04:16:48,979
I played in a Fortnite tournament and I did a five hour From Software tier list.

4158
04:16:48,979 --> 04:16:56,190
What a fucking weird stream this was.

4159
04:16:56,190 --> 04:16:57,190
I had a good time.

4160
04:16:57,190 --> 04:17:03,340
I don't like the fact that the internet kept having problems for no reason.

4161
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:05,340
Somebody was going like this to the wire.

4162
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:06,340
I don't get it.

4163
04:17:06,340 --> 04:17:10,649
It's annoying.

4164
04:17:11,649 --> 04:17:13,649
Dude, what the fuck is the Fortnite?

4165
04:17:13,649 --> 04:17:17,649
The one guy that came in for the Fortnite question?

4166
04:17:17,649 --> 04:17:20,170
I feel so bad.

4167
04:17:20,170 --> 04:17:24,170
That person is going to go to the VOD and just like scroll through and be like,

4168
04:17:24,170 --> 04:17:26,170
this is fucking stupid.

4169
04:17:26,170 --> 04:17:31,969
This guy had to resort to doing magic tricks because he doesn't know how to play Fortnite

4170
04:17:31,969 --> 04:17:33,969
and he joined a tournament.

4171
04:17:33,969 --> 04:17:39,540
I put money into Fortnite.

4172
04:17:39,540 --> 04:17:41,540
I bought a skin.

4173
04:17:41,540 --> 04:17:45,700
You missed the magic tricks?

4174
04:17:45,700 --> 04:17:46,700
You did?

4175
04:17:46,700 --> 04:17:49,860
That was the big nose of yours?

4176
04:17:49,860 --> 04:17:50,860
Sure.

4177
04:17:50,860 --> 04:17:58,750
I have a crooked nose.

4178
04:17:58,750 --> 04:17:59,750
Do you know that?

4179
04:17:59,750 --> 04:18:03,870
My nose is crooked.

4180
04:18:03,870 --> 04:18:04,870
You know, it goes that way.

4181
04:18:04,870 --> 04:18:06,870
Like it goes like this.

4182
04:18:06,870 --> 04:18:10,459
It's way more pronounced going this way, right?

4183
04:18:10,459 --> 04:18:11,459
Like that.

4184
04:18:11,459 --> 04:18:12,459
My nose is like this.

4185
04:18:12,459 --> 04:18:18,239
A link to the tier list.

4186
04:18:18,239 --> 04:18:20,239
Yep, I will.

4187
04:18:20,239 --> 04:18:21,610
I think it's a pretty good list.

4188
04:18:21,610 --> 04:18:23,610
I think it's, I mean, obviously Dark Souls 2.

4189
04:18:23,610 --> 04:18:26,610
I don't want to hate Dark Souls 2 and I think it's not fair.

4190
04:18:26,610 --> 04:18:32,040
I think it's a good big junk.

4191
04:18:32,040 --> 04:18:34,040
A bunch of, it's good.

4192
04:18:34,040 --> 04:18:35,040
I liked it.

4193
04:18:35,040 --> 04:18:36,040
I do like it.

4194
04:18:36,040 --> 04:18:44,979
I had enjoyed my time and I played through it a couple of times.

4195
04:18:44,979 --> 04:18:47,979
Osiris is the most forgettable thing in the game.

4196
04:18:47,979 --> 04:18:53,139
It shouldn't be at A.

4197
04:18:53,139 --> 04:18:56,379
Well, it should be at A, but it should not be higher than that.

4198
04:18:56,379 --> 04:18:57,379
That's what you meant to say.

4199
04:18:57,379 --> 04:18:59,379
Because, I mean, it's not cooler than that.

4200
04:18:59,379 --> 04:19:03,549
It's not.

4201
04:19:03,549 --> 04:19:04,549
Okay, now we're done.

4202
04:19:04,549 --> 04:19:16,120
Are you doing more magic tricks?

4203
04:19:16,120 --> 04:19:17,120
Or Dark Souls 2.

4204
04:19:17,120 --> 04:19:18,120
I feel bad.

4205
04:19:18,120 --> 04:19:20,510
It's okay.

4206
04:19:20,510 --> 04:19:23,510
All right, let me link to the, let me link to it.

4207
04:19:23,510 --> 04:19:26,840
All right, I'll see you guys later.

4208
04:19:26,840 --> 04:19:29,829
That's the end of the stream.

4209
04:19:29,829 --> 04:19:31,829
Kind of a weird one today, but you know.

4210
04:19:31,829 --> 04:19:43,979
The next stream, by the way, is going to be today's Tuesday.

4211
04:19:43,979 --> 04:19:47,780
I will see you guys on Friday?

4212
04:19:47,780 --> 04:19:48,780
Is that maybe Friday or Saturday?

4213
04:19:48,780 --> 04:19:57,219
Let's say, let's say Saturday.

4214
04:19:57,219 --> 04:19:58,850
We'll do Saturday, Sunday.

4215
04:19:58,850 --> 04:20:03,280
Is this the time where we pick to do Elden Ring invasions and PvP and stuff?

4216
04:20:03,280 --> 04:20:17,319
That might be a fun time to do it on Saturday, like afternoon.

4217
04:20:17,319 --> 04:20:21,879
And that will wrap up a lot of the Elden Ring stuff.

4218
04:20:21,879 --> 04:20:24,879
And then Sunday, you know, why don't we go play DOS games?

4219
04:20:24,879 --> 04:20:29,090
I think DOS Sunday sounds fun.

4220
04:20:29,090 --> 04:20:31,329
I'll get a bunch of crazy shit.

4221
04:20:31,329 --> 04:20:32,329
Do some DOS games.

4222
04:20:32,329 --> 04:20:41,930
So if you want to do Elden Ring multiplayer, Saturday is the day.

4223
04:20:41,930 --> 04:20:44,829
Put it on your calendar.

4224
04:20:44,829 --> 04:20:53,090
You're going to do a fight club?

4225
04:20:53,090 --> 04:21:00,760
I think I'm just going to put a password down and I'm just going to put my sign somewhere.

4226
04:21:00,760 --> 04:21:02,059
See what happens.

4227
04:21:02,059 --> 04:21:04,010
I moisturize.

4228
04:21:04,010 --> 04:21:06,010
I actually really do that, seriously.

4229
04:21:06,010 --> 04:21:09,950
Your 30 to 40 year old self will be very happy with you.

4230
04:21:09,950 --> 04:21:18,760
The battle chest, that might be my favorite one guy of the year so far.

4231
04:21:18,760 --> 04:21:20,639
That was an amazing comment.

4232
04:21:20,639 --> 04:21:24,180
You see the R play stuff?

4233
04:21:24,180 --> 04:21:25,180
I did.

4234
04:21:25,180 --> 04:21:26,180
I've been keeping up with it.

4235
04:21:26,180 --> 04:21:29,340
Although, isn't it over?

4236
04:21:29,340 --> 04:21:30,780
It ended, right?

4237
04:21:30,780 --> 04:21:37,200
Yeah, it's over.

4238
04:21:37,200 --> 04:21:50,020
Link the tier list.

4239
04:21:50,020 --> 04:21:51,020
I did.

4240
04:21:51,020 --> 04:21:52,020
I did, didn't I?

4241
04:21:52,020 --> 04:21:53,020
There you go.

4242
04:21:53,020 --> 04:22:01,600
What's the moisturizing routine?

4243
04:22:01,600 --> 04:22:02,600
Right out of the shower.

4244
04:22:02,600 --> 04:22:04,100
Dry your face.

4245
04:22:04,100 --> 04:22:06,100
Use a light moisturizing cream.

4246
04:22:06,100 --> 04:22:08,100
Make sure it's for your face.

4247
04:22:08,100 --> 04:22:09,590
Light.

4248
04:22:09,590 --> 04:22:14,739
None of this heavy, heavy cream shit.

4249
04:22:14,739 --> 04:22:16,739
They don't like the hand cream stuff.

4250
04:22:16,739 --> 04:22:18,040
No, no, no.

4251
04:22:18,040 --> 04:22:19,040
Get a light face moisturizer.

4252
04:22:19,040 --> 04:22:20,040
Water-based.

4253
04:22:20,040 --> 04:22:21,280
The ones that are gel.

4254
04:22:22,280 --> 04:22:25,719
They're kind of like a watery gel.

4255
04:22:25,719 --> 04:22:29,520
That's what you want.

4256
04:22:29,520 --> 04:22:31,520
When you get out of the shower, you dry your face.

4257
04:22:31,520 --> 04:22:35,020
Pat it dry for a little bit.

4258
04:22:35,020 --> 04:22:38,709
Get your light, kind of water, gel-based, base lotion.

4259
04:22:38,709 --> 04:22:40,399
It's the tip of your middle finger.

4260
04:22:40,399 --> 04:22:41,399
That's all you need.

4261
04:22:41,399 --> 04:22:42,639
Work it into your hands a little bit.

4262
04:22:42,639 --> 04:22:44,639
Maybe tap it on the cheekbones.

4263
04:22:44,639 --> 04:22:45,639
Rub it in.

4264
04:22:45,639 --> 04:22:46,639
All around your face.

4265
04:22:46,639 --> 04:22:48,010
Do that every day.

4266
04:22:48,010 --> 04:22:56,989
Skin routine.

4267
04:22:56,989 --> 04:23:00,340
It's really good for you.

4268
04:23:00,340 --> 04:23:01,340
It is.

4269
04:23:01,340 --> 04:23:03,670
It helps.

4270
04:23:03,670 --> 04:23:04,670
All right, guys.

4271
04:23:04,670 --> 04:23:05,670
It's late.

4272
04:23:05,670 --> 04:23:07,040
I'm going to get out of here.

4273
04:23:07,040 --> 04:23:08,040
Thanks for watching Fortnite?

4274
04:23:08,040 --> 04:23:09,040
Question mark.

4275
04:23:09,040 --> 04:23:12,040
And the from software tier list.

4276
04:23:12,040 --> 04:23:16,899
This is a weird one.

4277
04:23:16,899 --> 04:23:21,319
Sometimes they're weird.

4278
04:23:21,319 --> 04:23:23,319
Hanging out and doing the tier list was fun.

4279
04:23:23,319 --> 04:23:26,319
It's cool just to kind of look at stuff and hang out with you guys.

4280
04:23:26,319 --> 04:23:28,500
Doesn't have to be like crazy, right?

4281
04:23:28,500 --> 04:23:31,989
They don't all have to be crazy.

4282
04:23:31,989 --> 04:23:33,989
In fact, none of them are crazy.

4283
04:23:33,989 --> 04:23:34,989
I'm a normal person.

4284
04:23:34,989 --> 04:23:36,989
I'm a regular guy.

4285
04:23:36,989 --> 04:23:38,989
And I don't do crazy things.

4286
04:23:38,989 --> 04:23:41,360
We relax and do tier lists.

4287
04:23:41,360 --> 04:23:42,360
That's what we do.

4288
04:23:42,360 --> 04:23:51,959
If you're still here from Atrioc, thanks for the raid.

4289
04:23:51,959 --> 04:23:55,030
Hope you enjoyed yourselves.

4290
04:23:55,030 --> 04:24:00,180
And I'll see you guys on Saturday.

4291
04:24:00,180 --> 04:24:03,120
Have a great night.

4292
04:24:03,120 --> 04:24:04,120
Take care of yourselves.

4293
04:24:04,120 --> 04:24:05,549
Bye.
