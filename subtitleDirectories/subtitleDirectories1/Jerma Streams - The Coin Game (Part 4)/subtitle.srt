1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:14,740
Hello, should I leave the title as buying and selling organs? I feel like that's uh, kind of morbid for the next game we're playing.

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:29,500
What are you- what are they doing? What is- what is the chat doing right now? What's the meaning of this?

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:47,140
I broke the chat? What'd I do? What is- what are you- why- why are you revolting against me? What are you doing?

4
00:00:47,340 --> 00:01:04,280
Put us back in emote only mode. I will. I'm gonna drop this volume a little bit. What's- what's this little-

5
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,819
What's this bit that they're doing? Is this like a- what- what- what little routine is this?

6
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:33,500
Capture this game? What- what do they add? Is it actually like a big substantial update? That's pretty cool.

7
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,829
I love this game too. Video quality, uh,

8
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:46,769
Super computer. Looks fine. Mouse sensitivity, bring that down.

9
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:57,569
Leaderboards, I don't need the leaderboards. Who cares? Do 90 FOV. I do need to do this.

10
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:12,129
I remember this- I remember the sound effects were very loud. Turn that up. Okay, go back to the organ game.

11
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:20,110
I'm- I don't make me scream into my monitor. I really will. Okay, so I think I'm just gonna

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,509
just do the, sort of, birthday mode, because I just want to play the new stuff. Survival takes a little too long, I think.

13
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,949
Click play. Oh shit, that's cool.

14
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:41,490
Yeah, let's just do birthday mode. Go back to the organ game. You guys-

15
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:53,830
You guys- stop being such butt heads, okay? You guys are being butt heads. I'm gonna tell mom.

16
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:58,750
This is like the I'm telling mom. You're like holding your finger and putting it in my face, like I'm not touching you,

17
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm not touching you. I'm about to yell for mom. All right, here we go. So what- what are the- what's the additions?

18
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:28,900
Which, um, arcade should I go to? Did I shoot myself in the head? I thought it was-

19
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:38,610
No, what do you mean, new text message? Happy birthday, kid. All right, I got 200 bucks. The bullet went backwards.

20
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,960
Go to the-

21
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:51,800
Please don't listen to chat. Don't change the title. One-Eyed Billy's. Oh, okay. I forget where One-Eyed Billy's is.

22
00:03:52,439 --> 00:04:09,180
Larry's Pawn Shop, Larry's Arcade. Isn't it down on the coast somewhere? Oh, we'll find it. This is very loud.

23
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:17,680
This is exactly what I was talking about. The outside of this arcade looks like a strip club.

24
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:33,160
I do appreciate the GPS that's here now. All right, One-Eyed-

25
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,839
Don't hit me again, please. Okay.

26
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:57,670
Stuff it. Where is One-Eyed Billy's? Did they add another arcade or is it they add more machines to- Oh, One-Eyed Billy's is this way.

27
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:14,519
Oh my god, dude. There's a whole new arcade?

28
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,660
What? Holy shit, dude, you wouldn't believe it. The Oregon game just got a huge update. You should check it out.

29
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:36,699
You dick.

30
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:45,959
How do I reliably get over there? I guess I have to run.

31
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:54,129
Remember, your stream gave me acne. I didn't do anything.

32
00:05:54,769 --> 00:06:16,610
Eden Animals, that doesn't work right now. All right, One-Eyed Billy's is right here. Let's go check it out. I'm actually very interested.

33
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:33,870
By the way, I'm just realizing, aren't I like 13 or something? I feel like this would be incredible. Where are my parents?

34
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:50,680
This would be really dangerous. All right, One-Eyed Billy's. Adventure and Fun Center.

35
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:01,079
Celtics lost. I have not seen a Celtics player shoot a basket in probably like 11 years.

36
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:10,660
I have not watched a single game. I'm sorry. All right, should we get a pizza?

37
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:23,949
24-hour delivery. Earn money today. Pirate pizza. Wait, what? Deliver pirate pizzas. Click here to accept a delivery.

38
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:38,629
Fried baked pizzas. Pizza delivery. Seven dollars. Wait, did I just buy a pizza? Why am I purchasing this? What?

39
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:47,860
Why did I have to buy this? Who am I delivering this to? Who is supposed to be getting this? Oh my fucking god.

40
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:59,750
Where's my car? Where's my car? Where's the car? Did you expect it for free?

41
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,139
I don't expect to pay for a customer's order and then bring it to them. The customer pays for it

42
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:13,339
and then I get paid to bring it. Why do I have to pay for the customer's food?

43
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,579
The sound just got removed. Can I just run there? I definitely can run there.

44
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,860
You look out your window, like you order like

45
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,840
Uber eats or something and you look out your window and there's a guy just fucking

46
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,779
sprinting down your street with a bag of food in his hand.

47
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:53,460
He's in full stride and he still comes up as a car on the app when you look at the app and you know

48
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:06,450
you can see where the car is going. Oh, where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

49
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:19,070
What I don't what what where am I? Where am I? I don't know. What am I? Where am I? I'm the red?

50
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:38,000
Is this their house? Oh pizza. How do I get my inventory?

51
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:49,070
Hey, don't call my limo. What are you doing? Where am I? Did I just? No, I don't care.

52
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,460
I don't I want to go back to deliver that pizza. No, I need to take me to the place

53
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:02,519
I just was. I need to go back and deliver that pizza. I need to buy limo. Can I take it? Where am I? No, wait

54
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:12,779
Oh, for the love of God. Okay. Hold on. Wait. I have a car. Don't I have a bike?

55
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:28,019
Don't I have something to I don't have a car or anything. Okay this way. Oh, it looks like my

56
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,679
Uber Eats driver is right down the street. Let me open up the the blinds and see sprinting down the street

57
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,980
He's got a bag in his hand. He's here. Oh

58
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,659
He just got hit by a car. I think I hope he's okay. No limo just pulled up

59
00:10:45,820 --> 00:11:09,350
He's standing outside the door. He just got in the limo left. He's back running. Okay straight. All right, do I flashlight?

60
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:18,629
I thought I did you're not gonna make it. Yes. I have a hundred and twenty four seconds. I'm running a hundred and twenty five miles per hour

61
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:29,490
I'll be okay. Which house is it? It's this one right here. But where's my inventory? I?

62
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:51,840
I haven't played this in a long time. I have my credit card. K is inventory. I don't think so. It's on the watch tab

63
00:11:51,840 --> 00:12:02,580
All right, where the hell is this place right ahead? It's not this building. It's building right in front of me

64
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:24,080
I need to take it out golf cart Beach Billy's warehouse factory. There it is. Which house is it? Is this but okay?

65
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:36,039
It's right here. Where where is it right here? Oh

66
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:50,580
God this one. Where is this house?

67
00:12:51,059 --> 00:13:10,840
What's happening? Is it this house right here a dollar tip and he's slim. I actually just got one dollar tip

68
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:36,639
Okay, there's my limo in here. Let me in my car. Why can I not get in here?

69
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:59,399
I locked myself out of my own car. I can't take this off the card in this lot. I go to

70
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:27,039
One-eyed Billy's already not impounded. It's fine. Drive your car up here. It's not even that steep, please

71
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:36,440
You're me you should play at least the pain playing the painful is an arcade machine here at least the painful

72
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:54,230
All right. Finally, let's play some of the new games very excited. There are no breaks. I don't have breaks

73
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:03,820
I don't have breaks

74
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,620
Randomizing the play tables and coin. What do we play tables?

75
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:13,539
Well, you said there was a new boat ride to take which will do that sounds like fun

76
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:22,330
I want to do this. This is fun. I score is 175. I think I've done this already, but I love this game

77
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:52,470
I can't do it by a I got my 80s just freaking out. No matter what you guys. I can't trace anything

78
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:58,029
I also can't do this either. It makes me like want to puke. Oh, I did it. Oh

79
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:18,690
You play against another person. What's happening? Why am I getting attacked? What was that? Who just did that?

80
00:16:18,929 --> 00:17:06,079
I'm gonna fuck with me again. Oh hoops. I gotta get it in the spot a little higher. Come on

81
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:17,900
What's the point of a backboard? They always say aim for the backboard, but you never see like NBA players do that

82
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:34,960
They always just swish it or dunk it out and do but not really Mountain Dew

83
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:43,119
Oh, what's this one? You see these in like Dave and Buster sometimes you always wonder there's so much room

84
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,630
This is such a huge gigantic machine. It's so unnecessary

85
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:56,440
And this is by the way, this is one of the worst machines in the entire arcade. This thing sucks

86
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:05,430
Nobody likes playing this I've never seen anybody have fun playing this game. They always like swipe their card

87
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,630
They press it once they go. All right. This is right. What's over there? What's that over there? Is that a time crisis?

88
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,039
Nobody likes this game

89
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:23,910
And by the way, this game is always one of the most expensive ones in the entire casino 50 tickets. Hell, yeah

90
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:48,089
30 tickets. Oh, yeah in the middle what I get. What was that? What?

91
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,390
559 I got the jackpot. Oh my god

92
00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:19,599
Fake I'll give you another one. This is roulette for children. How many balls do I get tickets? Awesome? Yeah, I'll do it again

93
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:36,160
Say how much this sucks again. I think I just did it again. Holy shit. All right, I'm getting really lucky

94
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:58,250
Mystery, what's the mystery? Wow, that's a lot. I mean, this is a really good return on my investment

95
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:17,789
Turn it up a little bit. It's kind of low. I do it again. What is wrong with me, by the way, okay

96
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:41,049
I'm just gravitating towards this. This is all the little kids at the skeeball machine. You just open up Chuck E cheese and it's just like

97
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,849
I

98
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,990
Just keep it go go go go go go play skee ball skee ball skee ball skee skee skee

99
00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:09,099
I think I might this might be broken. I'm not sure what to do about this. I take my tickets

100
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:26,220
Think I might as a leave and come back. All right. Well, this one's broken. Just like at every fucking arcade

101
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,339
I'm not let me tell you at every arcade I've ever been to

102
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:36,000
It's always like one or two of these are just not working and they always have the best prizes in them

103
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is that some kind of crazy conspiracy?

104
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,849
It's always the ones that are not on that have the best prizes inside

105
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:57,549
This one's kind of cool and what they should do is take the prizes out of the one that's broken and put it in the

106
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,990
One you can actually use

107
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:29,250
There's a fidget spinner in here. These my tickets. Oh, those are 80 tickets. All right. Okay. I want the fidget spinner

108
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm gonna get it. I

109
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:51,579
Like the golf balls is cool. Is that money? I don't think I can rotate it settle down. That was way off

110
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:55,859
I think I got it though. Oh, come on. Was it a razor?

111
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,960
Good again

112
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:09,700
What's the biggest prize I've ever won?

113
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:22,319
Um, I'll hit the flaming finger. He doesn't want to talk about I think I goes flated finger get your flame on and you have to

114
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,680
Go like with your finger. It's a trace inside the lines

115
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,490
I've beaten that one before and I got I think like a thousand tickets whatever the jackpot was

116
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:43,279
I actually beat it. I made this up. It's an actual game. I won't hold on. No, I'm not done. I want that

117
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,880
Whatever it is

118
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,660
There's a strategy with that though is you don't it it's you get friction if you use the pad of your finger

119
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,059
So you have to use almost like the top of your nail and the the top part of your finger

120
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,279
So you use almost your fingernail and the small part of the pad at the top right where the fingernail reaches

121
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:10,599
Like right where your fingernail touches your pad of your finger is that's what you should be using to play flaming finger

122
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:24,049
The money. Oh my goodness. Come on

123
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,319
What is flaming finger flaming finger is a arcade game?

124
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,329
You have to trace inside of a gigantic maze in five seconds the whole maze

125
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:41,569
Is that not in?

126
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:52,519
Arcades anymore. I feel like I've seen it. Oh my goodness. Please just give that to me. I

127
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:13,880
Need one of the fidget spinners. It's this why is it swaying so much? That's how they get you stop swaying

128
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:30,759
Give it to me. You're doing great

129
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:42,259
That was makeup on that's what the face came isn't on. There you got me. I don't want movement

130
00:25:54,819 --> 00:26:01,460
I see I can't see from the other side. Oh my god. Stop moving around so much

131
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:09,519
All these golf balls are messing everything up. Just just leave I'll come back later

132
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,640
Just leave I'm done. What's this one?

133
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:30,450
Fishy fishy. Ooh, this is cool. This is definitely wasn't here last time now the crane

134
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,160
I wonder how much better this just you know, let's see. I'm going with it for the

135
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:47,009
Flam the shell whatever it is right in front that one down right there grab it

136
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:51,779
Let's see it first try. Come on

137
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,339
Oh, yeah

138
00:26:54,339 --> 00:27:03,839
Give me another one. I think I got this one. This one should be easy

139
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,349
Oh, yeah, if that grips. No, it's okay hit the snail

140
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,430
I'll get it. How much is this worth?

141
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:30,539
Probably sell that I want to play the air hockey. I play against someone

142
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,940
Oh, okay

143
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,859
What don't laugh at me?

144
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:50,160
You guys have to understand the strategy with air hockey

145
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,359
As you just stay completely still right in the middle and your friend will fuck everything up

146
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,079
You just don't have to move. They're gonna try to be like

147
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,799
It's gonna bounce all over the place

148
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,609
Well, this was an ai

149
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,849
Your goal is you want to go straight forward let your friend just do a bunch of crazy shit. They're gonna screw up

150
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,640
Because they're always gonna bounce to the edges

151
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,220
Just defend this middle part and you'll be completely fine. See what happened

152
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:26,960
Is a crowd forming

153
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,319
This like four or five inches right here is the only thing you should be concerned about at all

154
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:39,740
Just wait for your buddy to rear back and go smash and then it bounces king king king king back and hits him in the fucking finger

155
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,940
And he's gonna go. Oh shit, and it's gonna be inside. It's you don't have to do anything

156
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,980
Varying speeds too. That doesn't make any sense. This is one way for my body

157
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:10,910
That doesn't make any sense either

158
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:16,500
Get over here somebody else

159
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,140
Or you know what another strategy is and i've used this before too and it really really pisses people off

160
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,190
Is you just go like this

161
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,230
You just go back back back back back back back up up up up up up up up up

162
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:35,539
Like that, I mean it's gonna make you sick if I keep doing it, but you get the idea

163
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,839
And then they'll eventually score on themselves

164
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,230
That's classic. Oh, yeah

165
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:54,960
I'm the you hold on. I am reaching that far

166
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,329
That seems like too far to reach

167
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:28,720
Why is it a yo-yo? I'm not doing the strategy. It's not working. That's a new game idea. That'd be really dangerous

168
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,319
I don't think that'd be safe

169
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:36,829
I'm gonna get hurt

170
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,829
You know what? I also think too

171
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:42,029
I also think that these paddles should be heavy

172
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:44,190
They should be weighted

173
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,690
and i'll tell you one reason why

174
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,450
the amount of people that get on these machines and act like absolute assholes

175
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,009
And just swing as hard as they can and smash this shit across the arcade

176
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,269
if these things were like

177
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:00,430
seven to if they were like ten pounds

178
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:06,109
And you had to like drag them around and actually you couldn't like swing like crazy and knock it off the thing

179
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,109
And they should be attached

180
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,109
These should be attached to here

181
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,059
This should be on a track. That's literally here like this

182
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,779
And it should weigh like fucking five pounds

183
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,390
Just make it. Yeah, and somebody is every two other people

184
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,430
No way. I have to let me rephrase that

185
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:40,690
It should be

186
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,970
tethered

187
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,170
To a wire or something that can only move like this far

188
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:51,970
Right. So not like a track but on a tether so it can move like this, right?

189
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:57,329
On a wire or whatever the tether it has to be on and it needs to weigh like at least a few pounds

190
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,789
Are you losing to a little kid?

191
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,609
I'm barely even playing the game. I'm explaining how to make this game better

192
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,500
I think I've mentioned this before but uh, you know lying on top of one of these things

193
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,539
Just letting the air hit every fucking pore of your body. That's like

194
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,180
I like want that

195
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,700
I want a

196
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,180
Um air hockey table in my house not to play it

197
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
To be have to be a relaxation zone

198
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,960
Is that weird?

199
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,920
Let me say that in the middle of like the hottest days of summer when it's 110 115 plus degrees here

200
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
lying on top of one of these and having

201
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,180
Hundreds of little air jets hit you in every corner of your body

202
00:32:47,140 --> 00:33:01,619
I wouldn't even play this thing

203
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,190
And get one just take a shower

204
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,750
But I don't want to get wet. I don't know who's winning right now. I can't even tell

205
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:26,480
Is this supposed to be a little kid?

206
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I'm talking about your fetishes

207
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
That's very specific

208
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:48,349
Yeah, I see what happens is I get off to uh lying on my back on an air hockey table

209
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,359
I'm letting the air hit me in the back

210
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,589
Good luck finding pornography for that. There's probably three videos on the internet where that happens

211
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,259
You know, you're not gonna you're gonna have to cycle before like two videos

212
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
You could just corner the market

213
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,289
I don't I don't think there's very large market for that

214
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,369
If you're talking about uh, like a business expense for yourself

215
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,730
I'm not sure you would ever recoup the cost of the table

216
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,239
Does anybody else think this is getting a little ridiculous that this is still going?

217
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:07,150
And I have to admit this happens when I play regular ice hockey not ice hockey, uh table hockey

218
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,809
What the hell is this called?

219
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:15,570
After about five minutes neither person wants to play anymore, but nobody wants to back away because this was four dollars

220
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,199
I won I just kicked his ass

221
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:33,840
That's pretty good tickets

222
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,280
I am not kidding. I have left games without being completed

223
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,800
There have been people waiting to play air hockey sort of another like couple group or kids or something that I and

224
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
And i've gotten like two to two

225
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,599
Like one to three or something versus somebody

226
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,539
And we just leave

227
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:55,019
Like oh that was fun. I know you guys can just take it

228
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,210
I actually in fact will say I think air hockey

229
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,130
is

230
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,849
The worst thing that's in the arcades because it takes up so much space and I find it to be

231
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,250
After five minutes a game. I don't want to play anymore

232
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,030
Like not even two minutes

233
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I would rather there be

234
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,909
I want more games like video games and not just the same video game

235
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:37,039
Where they give you a machine gun a plastic machine gun to fire at aliens. I'm sick of those, too

236
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:46,019
arcades nowadays have seriously become like 10 plastic machine gun shooters 10 car games and then a bunch of like

237
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:57,150
Coin pushers was the mortal combat

238
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,590
They tuck that shit in the corner

239
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,710
Where's turtles in time they put that stuff in like the jokey retro section where there's three cabinets

240
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:16,769
They're covered in dust. Nobody plays them air hockey's fun game

241
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,050
I don't get I don't know. I think it's uh, I think it's taking up too much space too much space

242
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:33,340
Go to a retro arcade. Yeah, but those are so few and far between

243
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:46,559
I think it's fun, but please remove it from all arcades

244
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,719
I didn't say remove i'm just talking about there's usually like four or five of them

245
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,269
That take up the a huge amount of real estate because you have to have a huge amount of real estate to put them down

246
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:02,349
Then there are these things

247
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:10,559
Do you know how many simpsons arcade games could fit just right here?

248
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:12,579
eight

249
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:16,420
You could fit six arcade cabinets one, two, three, four fives

250
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:33,900
How am I supposed to get it down all the golf balls are in the way

251
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,090
Dave and busters is all that we have. Yeah, I think that kind of

252
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,429
I don't know. Here's the weird thing about arcades nowadays

253
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Is all these companies bait

254
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
everybody now with nostalgia

255
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:02,900
Yet no one will make an arcade that has the old games in it and then really have it be like a big business

256
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,239
Like they just pull on all of our nostalgia heartstrings

257
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,780
But they won't put any of these like old cool arcade games

258
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,139
Dave and busters is just like

259
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:19,139
The same this kind of shit everywhere

260
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,929
There's there. Yeah, they exist but it's maybe one in one every major city maybe has one

261
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:33,699
maybe

262
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:36,179
Round one does do it round one does it to an extent?

263
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:43,599
But I really do kind of miss just like the old just arcade games where you just the cabinets

264
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,530
You just played a game

265
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,570
And you had to put you know coins in for lives and stuff. I miss that

266
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,059
Arcades are the way to go

267
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:02,050
That's true

268
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,460
That's true. I'm just trying to get these golf balls out of the way

269
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,360
There's not a market for it anymore

270
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,960
Yeah, but that's my that's that's my point though. There's not a market for it anymore yet

271
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,780
They keep remaking video games and movies and stuff

272
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,579
I think there is it's just nobody really wants to put the time and money into doing it

273
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:38,800
I so badly want this fidget spinner old arcade cabinets are hard to maintain

274
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,570
Yeah, i'm just a salty old person

275
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,719
I will get this before I turn the stream off

276
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,340
I promise

277
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,940
In fact, i'm getting it right now

278
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:05,440
No, i'm going too far up. I'm convinced anime conventions have big arcades

279
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,079
I remember

280
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,199
I think like some of the packs at some point had this old retro arcade room

281
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,380
It was awesome

282
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,260
It was like 50 cabinets old like donkey kong like joust and all that stuff. It was so cool

283
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,659
And that might be it

284
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:31,389
There it is

285
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:34,429
Hold on a little longer stuff swinging around so much. Yeah

286
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,579
All right, let's go

287
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:53,389
Where is it? Um, where's my fidget spinner? It was just five dollars

288
00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:06,769
Oh, what's this? What is this time score? I have to shoot like a water cannon. This is cool

289
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:21,659
What boat am I what am I supposed to do pick up the

290
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:30,820
Oh, okay. I have to pick these up

291
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
Oh boy. I have no idea where I am

292
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,460
earn

293
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,710
I'm blue in the corner. This is cool

294
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,139
I love those old midway games too. We have to spray the water into the hole

295
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:14,269
If I was ever a billionaire I would just I would probably lose 50 000 a day on this project

296
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,750
I would love to just have a huge awesome arcade that had so much of this stuff

297
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:26,429
All the old classics just like a hundred plus old, uh retro arcade cabinets all the old stuff remembers

298
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:32,099
I would probably just lose money every day

299
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:47,360
I can't tell even what direction I am. Can I turn around?

300
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,780
Rent out an arcade instead

301
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,539
Say toy boat toy boat toy boat that was cell phone did

302
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:08,849
Honestly, the way that that boat over on the left was I thought it was spongebob in the water

303
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,619
Vegas is probably the place to do that

304
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:27,230
That was cool. I got tickets for that. How do I get off?

305
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:33,309
Oh, that's a lot. It's 600 tickets

306
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:49,199
Did that one? I got that one. I beat that one. This minute did I oh this mini golf

307
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I don't think I did mini golf. Did I?

308
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:56,960
Last time I played it

309
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,239
I got I've got to put all the new viewers. I gotta impress the hell out of them, right?

310
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,820
How could I not impress the new viewers with this?

311
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,699
You know when I got this it was like five or six times in a row

312
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:38,929
Ah, come on this was the ayaya game. Yes it was

313
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:45,409
I gotta get it twice in a row

314
00:45:52,099 --> 00:46:03,960
Come on apologize apologize apologize apologize. I am so sorry. I am so sorry

315
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,139
What was this what I just got distracted get out of here

316
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:24,179
Come on three times in a row

317
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:35,090
Oh, I forgot about this you can just keep going

318
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:41,139
Let's try to crash the whole game and just try to fill this entire arcade with tickets until like everybody has to run out

319
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:49,179
This is really loud. You're right. It is

320
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:15,949
Now what what's going on here? Come on. What happened to the organ game?

321
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Um, I got two endings

322
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,769
and

323
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:25,579
I thought it was a really fun game

324
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:28,539
But I realized that coin game had an update I didn't know about

325
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,980
And now chat was very very, uh excited about it

326
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,780
Incredibly excited about this update

327
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,400
So I was like, you know what fine we'll play this too

328
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,119
Organ dev. Thank you on twitter. It was really sweet that game was

329
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,840
Very very very fun

330
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,619
That was like I would give that at least

331
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,659
I mean something high that was fucking really good. I might play it again on my own time

332
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,960
He got bullied into playing coin game

333
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,820
This game is really fun too

334
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,429
There it is. Finally. All right, I got three

335
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,349
All right one more

336
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:30,369
One more jackpot and i'm done

337
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:38,940
Come on one more. Come on

338
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,449
You gotta play dizzy bird. I'll play dizzy bird

339
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,480
I've lost my magic here

340
00:48:48,480 --> 00:49:00,380
There we go. Don't break my shit

341
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:27,579
So much dopamine. There really is dopamine. I'll play this one too. This one new. It's not bad

342
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,599
2500s on there too. Holy crap

343
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:40,130
I never play these when I go to the arcade. They feel too random

344
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:52,590
I feel like I have no control over what's going on right now. The organ game actually updated for you

345
00:49:53,389 --> 00:50:02,110
No, they did not the organ trader dev actually updated the game to spite chat what

346
00:50:04,429 --> 00:50:14,219
No, they didn't hold on. What was the update?

347
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:23,420
No joke. Hold on. What what what was the twitter again? I just I just

348
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:34,690
Moved out. I just closed out of the window. Oh, hey chat. You got proof

349
00:50:38,380 --> 00:51:03,730
Okay. Okay. What was the update? He said I do not fuck around update queued. Wait, hold on. This is this is actually hilarious

350
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:27,230
Okay, let me read this he found his connect he read the tweets live on stream like my parents on christmas

351
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:36,860
Nerma putting even more cash into x cormac's remnants to drive down his average price paid and justified in his investment with a big

352
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:46,260
Meme face he gets it portions of the chat kept asking for a different game

353
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,820
So often that he switched to emote only so they'd shut the fuck up and he could concentrate on trading organs

354
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:54,019
That might be the best endorsement i've seen of the game so far. Holy shit

355
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,300
He was holding his urine for four hours to keep playing

356
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,380
Building and uploading a new steam version specifically so that the chat isn't gaslighting germa about a new

357
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:27,889
Update anymore. Are you kidding me? This is that's that's actually hilarious

358
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,570
one guy

359
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:39,340
In this chat said hey dude, go back. They updated organ trading simulator lol

360
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:47,360
It's like aha. That's funny. They they go and update it and like you you actually were correct about that

361
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:57,219
That's a pretty huge one guy moment just to spite the chat. That's that's more. There's an update actually queued for it

362
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:02,960
That's so funny

363
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,219
That's too funny

364
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,460
Well, they said thanks for playing the game. I mean the game's great

365
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:13,739
You should be you should be uh, very proud of what you've made. It's very fun

366
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:30,670
Give me my cards back. I like playing these. These are fun. Did I get the bonus?

367
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:39,230
I always like to I queue up the coins. I don't like doing one and then wait. I just at the arcade I go one

368
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,010
two

369
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:50,610
Three or bonus five bonus six bonus seven bonus, right? Then you stop see I got i'm throwing off

370
00:53:55,489 --> 00:54:11,809
Where's dizzy bird? I want to play dizzy bird after this. Okay. Well, I that was I think the game was broken. That was weird

371
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:21,199
Oh, give me this

372
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,780
Flying around this place

373
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,099
Why am I larping here? What am I doing?

374
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:34,289
We

375
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,989
Yay

376
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:41,070
Let me put the oh

377
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:56,860
I remember watching the critical video where he just literally won this every single time

378
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:32,429
The videos that video is actually like an s video s plus first try. Let's go. How much is that 2 000 tickets?

379
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,469
I'll take them

380
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:41,889
You have to understand something. I watched that I watched that critical video. I can beat this every time

381
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:50,219
I think these are new. I don't remember these being here

382
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,690
They left and yeah, this is definitely new stuff

383
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,199
and I

384
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:23,539
What networking andy? I said I was a fan of critical's videos

385
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:29,260
That's not networking any that's that's recognizing a good content creator

386
00:56:53,340 --> 00:57:02,260
Pinball machine drops frames. That's all right. It's fine. Oh my god. Why do those exist?

387
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,179
Biggest scam in the pinball industry ever is having that spot on the left and right where the ball just drops down

388
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:18,849
It's so dumb the pinball game is supposed to be about skill and what the hell is the point of those?

389
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:29,070
There's nothing fun about the left and right traps

390
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,760
Nothing nothing fun about

391
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:38,000
Pinball in general like I don't even know why I play it because the game it's literally why would I play pinball?

392
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:52,610
Oh, what what is this space invaders?

393
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:07,820
This is so cool. The dev of this game seriously put so much time into this

394
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,159
What are they like up like 60 or 70 machines now to play maybe more. I don't even know

395
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,679
There's a lot in this game

396
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,099
This is like the fourth plus I think fourth or fifth time i've played this on stream. Just keep adding stuff

397
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:44,659
I'll get it. I'll get it. I got it. All right, come on these little popcorns

398
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:57,059
What are they do mini golf? Yeah, i'll do mini golf after this. I can I forgot this

399
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,179
I thought this is a different day and I was under the desk with that hair

400
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:17,969
I thought that was four days ago. All right, you gotta use defense here. Oh shit. All right, I lost

401
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:41,260
Now I don't want to play this anymore get in. Uh

402
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:54,050
What do I think this is? What what? Oh, no, i'm trapped in here. I can't grab anything. What's wrong with my arms?

403
00:59:56,429 --> 01:00:40,929
What let us peep the horror. Oh, i'm busy the third time i've said that today, isn't it? All right

404
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:46,559
Cool. What else is here? That's new. Ooh

405
01:00:50,159 --> 01:01:06,670
Oh shit, all right. I get it. You just don't want to get it in the big ones. Okay, I say I want to spin

406
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:32,300
Hell, yeah, let's go. What do I get? Give me the whole 3000. That's all right. It's not bad. That's not bad

407
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:43,570
It's not bad. I think that one was here. These three definitely were not this shit

408
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:59,969
Not this again. I was obsessed with this now. This is the children's roulette. Yeah, I had it wrong

409
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:20,909
I'm not gonna spend time here. Don't worry. I'm out. I'll do mini golf. Should I count my tickets?

410
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:33,500
How many tickets do I have? What is the ticket counting machine? All right mini golf

411
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:54,190
Uh, i'll play 18 holes that might be way too much. Oh boy. That's probably I made a mistake nice vans

412
01:02:54,590 --> 01:03:11,389
Hey, thanks the depart too. All right, let's go. It's out hole in one hole in one or I will gift 10

413
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:16,719
Dollars

414
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:39,090
Lotto or a new toy. All right hole in one right here. I will never mind. Those are the real stakes

415
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:44,739
Does anybody else not have the patience for mini golf at all?

416
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:59,889
There's nothing in this world that infuriates me more than this game because once you go over three or four strokes

417
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:07,039
You just get pissed and kind of embarrassed

418
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:29,389
Especially if your ball bounces out the play field and then you end up just dragging the ball over into the I used to

419
01:04:29,389 --> 01:04:30,989
Hate mini golf. I really did

420
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:36,340
It's kind of weird because I really don't like mini golf and I don't like bowling either

421
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:52,380
I just get frustrated and annoyed and impatient bowling is sick dude. I trust me. I know I like watching good bowlers

422
01:04:52,380 --> 01:05:13,489
I don't like to bowl myself. I just can't this one. You want to go on the right side? Come on, really?

423
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:37,860
That's it right there. That would have been great too hard. See right now my lips just went like this

424
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:55,739
Okay, if i'm if i'm actually in the mini golf place, my mouth just went like this that happens like my lips go

425
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:03,199
Mm-hmm go right up here

426
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:08,860
Okay

427
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:15,820
If I get a hole in one at any point during this course and i'm gonna eat a pepperoni pizza tonight

428
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,869
If not, then it's all salads. We're talking kale

429
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,269
spinach

430
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:26,050
radishes

431
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,969
So maybe some red onion. No, I I want a hole in one i'm gonna get a pepperoni pizza

432
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:45,869
Or have to eat a gross salad. Oh, I was gonna say it's pizza tonight

433
01:06:48,239 --> 01:07:01,199
No, I don't want to eat a salad. I like salads, but I don't want one for dinner. You are so dumb

434
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:18,780
Why would I go with it?

435
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:28,030
Salad night tonight and it's looking more and more like a salad night. This is my chance

436
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:35,440
This is yeah, this is my chance right at the end right there. That'll do it

437
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:46,690
Oh, no

438
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:59,949
It doesn't want to eat vegetables golf sucks. I hate this sport so much. You know, it just it

439
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:09,630
Perplexes me it intrigues me. I don't I don't want to play this. All right, you want to have a round of golf? No

440
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:17,409
No, like can't we play frisbee?

441
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:19,250
That sounds like more fun

442
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:24,989
I don't want to play golf once you hit like 35 years old or like 30

443
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:36,220
It's almost like you're supposed to like this. I don't and it's treated so

444
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,500
Like oh my god, it's the best. It's so much fun. It's so incredible

445
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:43,569
I don't like I don't want to walk around and chase balls

446
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:52,979
I don't want to take like a big drive into the ball slice across it. No

447
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,020
It takes so long. It takes an entire day to play

448
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:10,460
It takes way too long to play and you can't play three rounds. You can't do three holes people be like

449
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:16,109
No, I want to do nine. Let's do nine. By the way, let's wake up at four o'clock in the morning

450
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:27,939
What are you doing? It's like everything I hate about the whole universe wake up wicked early

451
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:34,020
Walk around like miles and

452
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:36,739
Swing and try to hit a tiny little thing

453
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,979
It's like all my least favorite things in the world

454
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:56,829
I don't like anything about it anything about it. Why is your name gas can easy to remember that counts

455
01:09:56,829 --> 01:10:12,750
I get pizza that counts. I get pepperoni pizza tonight. I like this a little lightning they're doing here

456
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:30,880
I don't mind golf and it's like it's so asmr

457
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,079
They do like golf is the original asmr

458
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:48,340
Looks like he's uh gonna be at the he's in the sandpit here

459
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:54,130
See if he can try to get his way out of that one small little swing will do it

460
01:10:54,130 --> 01:11:15,300
I think why don't they just put the announcers like why is it such a big deal?

461
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:24,060
We have people that go up to bat in baseball games in stadiums full of 60 to 70 000 people screaming

462
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,979
Everybody's gonna be shit. Everybody's gonna be so quiet at the golf course

463
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,380
He's gonna swing and hit this thing

464
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,890
They have to swing and hit things in baseball the things that are coming at them 100 miles per hour

465
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:53,090
Imagine a stadium for golf that I actually would probably like it a little bit more

466
01:11:53,859 --> 01:12:01,949
I'm not kidding if there was like a putting competition and everyone was just fucking chugging beers and like freaking out and screaming

467
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:15,840
I think that would be so entertaining. I think that'd be so funny mini golf. Why is there not a mini golf?

468
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:37,140
Stadium event. I think that would be so awesome. You need oh don't even please don't give me more ideas

469
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:47,460
Can you imagine how dumb that would be if there was like a stadium with like 40 000 people in it?

470
01:12:47,619 --> 01:12:53,329
It was just a mini golf course and the mini and the course was wicked fucked up. It's crazy shit happening

471
01:12:53,489 --> 01:13:13,170
Let me do baseball first and then we'll see now. I'm obviously just messing around golf is fine

472
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:20,189
I just find it to be boring. I mean we got everyone's to be quiet

473
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:31,789
Wait, somebody said viva labam did that in 2004. Did they really?

474
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:42,930
How do you remember that?

475
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:57,329
That's so funny. You're describing. Holy moly

476
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:04,180
Wait a minute. I I'm I'm very curious at this point. What is holy moly?

477
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:15,569
Holy moly show

478
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:32,029
Uh-huh. Oh everyone wants a burger mcdonald's the first big mac and after their first big mac

479
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:50,939
Oh delicious madhouse pop pop mcdonald's chicken. It's nugget. This is a real show. I can't believe this is a real show

480
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:53,819
Holy mo is it bam margera?

481
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:01,170
Welcome to holy mo. You might think i'm just another celebrity cameo at the what?

482
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,420
Way more involved in it. They get celebrities to do this

483
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:16,430
Maybe sit back and relax. I don't know

484
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:22,270
I thought that was a big mac for mcdonald's. I thought there was another ad playing or he was in this or something

485
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:24,979
This is holy moly

486
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,340
I can't believe this is real

487
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:53,890
They came in twos from across the land to do mini golf battle one-on-one the most skilled competitors on the planet

488
01:15:55,649 --> 01:16:00,659
Competing on the most epic mini golf course. Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me

489
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:11,500
For glory, why do they have to do this? Why have to go up the aggro crag? What does this have to do with mini golf?

490
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:30,659
25 grand it's ninja warrior most extreme elimination challenge wipeout and golf

491
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:34,739
And yes, this is literally a mini golf competition and yes

492
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:41,939
It's on prime time with an absurd budget, but is this on tv still this is june of 2019 is this trailer?

493
01:16:48,510 --> 01:17:00,220
He said no shot no shot. Hold on. Let me see. Holy moly cancelled. Let me type that holy moly

494
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:10,189
Cancelled holy moly has been renewed through a fourth season season 3 will debut june 17th

495
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:19,140
2021 still on the air. Well, never mind there goes that idea. It was a good one

496
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,880
I just accidentally just did that to 12 000 people. I just gave you an advertisement to go watch that show

497
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,699
Well, let me know how it is

498
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:51,600
All right. Hey, I got a hole in one that means I get pepperoni pizza thousand tickets. Holy

499
01:17:52,239 --> 01:18:01,390
Holy, I gotta go to mcdonald's first. You need to go to mcdonald's to get yourself a quarter pounder with extra cheese

500
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:16,079
Why do you keep doing that? Oh now I want mcdonald's

501
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,170
Why does all advertising work?

502
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:55,010
Don't spray me. I love these little things nice right there get that rat got it. Would it land on 10 bucks?

503
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:04,189
I think I got them all

504
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:11,470
I'm all right the title. Oh the title is buying and selling organs

505
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:20,079
You're right. It's all right. I don't shoot again. Where's my mouse?

506
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:27,739
Uh, I lost my mouse

507
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,739
This is not good. Where'd my mouse go?

508
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,310
mouse

509
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,140
on the screen

510
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,739
uh

511
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:43,970
This is bad. Okay. Did I see everything in the update?

512
01:19:47,979 --> 01:19:55,300

515
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:08,640

516
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:15,260
I did what I wanted to do. We're gonna just chatting for like five minutes

517
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:20,750
Because I need to have it be over five hours. So it makes it look like I streamed for five hours

518
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:27,020
Very important before anybody leaves. I know i'm saying all right, that's it. But listen here is very important
