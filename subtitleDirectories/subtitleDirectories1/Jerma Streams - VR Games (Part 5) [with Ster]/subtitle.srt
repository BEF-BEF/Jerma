1
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:24,390
You weren't supposed to be able to see me yet. I'm not supposed to be on here.

2
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:38,219
But hi. He thinks he's live. Don't turn it off.

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,530
No, I'm fucking out of here. Just like listening to like the bibidibid bibidibid bib.

4
00:00:43,530 --> 00:01:16,150
Right back. Okay. That means your mic is hot now.

5
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,819
Okay. My first time. Hey everybody, welcome to the stream.

6
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,609
You know me. Look at your wrist to view your watch.

7
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,930
Don't listen to that lady. She's going to say that over and over again.

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,370
You can hear me, right? Oh yeah.

9
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:45,659
Good. Today we're going to play some fun co-op VR games. Me and my friend Ster here.

10
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,180
Look at your wrist to view your watch. Some of you might have heard of them once.

11
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,640
Very fun games. We picked the most exciting VR games that have ever been made.

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,879
Last week we played, what was it? Lethal League Blitz? Last week.

13
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,400
Actually that was only like three days ago.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,879
Something like that. I got the wrong hands on.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,069
So yeah, we don't know how to do any of this. We've been sitting here for a little while.

16
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,509
You say VR stream, but you mean like tech stream.

17
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,509
We've never played, I've never done any VR multiplayer.

18
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,150
And it was just like, let's do it. And we both sat down for a while.

19
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,750
We were like, we picked out some games to do.

20
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,150
And then we sat down to actually try to do that. We have no idea what to do.

21
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,710
So, so far I'm pretty good at buying VR games.

22
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,509
Yeah. I'm really good at like purchasing games on steam at this point.

23
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,189
Look at your wrist to view your watch.

24
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,069
That one will.

25
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,189
All right. Are you, are you going in?

26
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,219
I'm, I'm in the tutorial room.

27
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,460
Yeah, me too. But are you like going in? Are you in?

28
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,379
Oh, I'm in.

29
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,500
Okay. Just I need, I need you to, I need clarification that you're in.

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,740
So I can go in too. So then we can, I could be in here.

31
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,949
Look at your wrist to view your watch.

32
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,590
My balls are dangling right now. You're going to have to tell me.

33
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,789
I'm in. Get in.

34
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,280
All right. That's all I needed to hear, man.

35
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,740
This thing's, oh, this is too tight.

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,659
Look at your wrist to view your watch.

37
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,099
Wait, technical difficulties.

38
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,639
Okay. It's too big. All right.

39
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,409
Are you in?

40
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,050
I'm in. Oh, I'm in.

41
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,210
I think I just pulled out all the hair in the front of my head.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,840
Look at your wrist to view your watch.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,759
I'm going to look at my wrist. Just relax.

44
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,699
Are you seriously not looking at your wrist right now?

45
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,740
Hold on. Look.

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,539
I thought you were in.

47
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,300
I'm in now.

48
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,620
Okay. There you guys are. Hi, guys.

49
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,990
Look at your wrist. I did.

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,189
All right. Here's my wrist.

51
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,629
Let's get you into a game.

52
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,590
All right. Let's get into a game.

53
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,110
Press the play button on your watch.

54
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,430
Plus the fucking headphones just came out.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,949
I'm stuffing these in as deep as I can.

56
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,530
I don't even know if this is the right one.

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,490
I did buy like the VR, like fucking cocking glue

58
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,569
that you just stuff it in your ear and it's a headphone.

59
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,150
And you need to get like a goddamn surgeon to get it out.

60
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,990
All right. How do I join your video game?

61
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,470
Go to play.

62
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,639
Look at your watch.

63
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,639
All right. There's paintball, paddle ball, paintball, crimson cauldron,

64
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,439
laser tag, golden trophy.

65
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,970
How do I like be your friend?

66
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,290
Look at your watch.

67
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,889
I am in my watch. Where are you?

68
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,490
You look at your watch and it says people.

69
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,089
And I imagine you're people.

70
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:40,589
People?

71
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,689
Oh, it's like forcing us to press the play button.

72
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,230
What do you see? People.

73
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,430
Right below.

74
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,209
Okay. Hold on.

75
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,810
Go back to the home menu.

76
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,870
And it's making me pick paddle ball.

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,149
It's making me pick paddle ball too.

78
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,990
Is this like putting us in the game together?

79
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,370
Let's pick paddle ball.

80
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,569
All right. Just pick paddle ball.

81
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,209
It's going to be easily.

82
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,649
We're the only people queuing a rec room paddle ball tutorial mode right now.

83
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,449
You'll be matched with another player.

84
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,810
It's you. We didn't have to...

85
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,930
Hey, look over here.

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,689
To go through the glowing door to practice.

87
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,689
Is it your name is pasty octopus?

88
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,970
And you're coming through twice.

89
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:20,569
Nice.

90
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,610
How do I delete that?

91
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,209
And when you're ready, one last...

92
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:26,589
Voices.

93
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,970
Does voices turn that off?

94
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,970
My microphone.

95
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,589
Turn your microphone off in the settings.

96
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:36,910
Where?

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,910
Open up your fucking like Aqua Teen watch.

98
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm in the watch.

99
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,949
Why can I still hear you?

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,110
Where do I turn it off?

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,389
Go into your watch.

102
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,629
Go to settings and then turn up my microphone.

103
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:51,129
Turn off.

104
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:55,829
That's off.

105
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,110
Why are you huge?

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
This is how tall I am.

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,399
You're not like six, eight.

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,600
What? It maps the VR to where your head is.

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,120
No, no, that's ridiculous.

110
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,759
Give me a high five.

111
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,720
That was a good one right there, man.

112
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,879
Oh, yeah.

113
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,360
He's fucking huge, man.

114
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,879
What the fuck are you doing?

115
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,240
Why would you do that?

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,879
What? I just wanted to play rock, paper, scissors.

117
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,379
You ready?

118
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
What the fuck is wrong with them?

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,199
We only have five minutes.

120
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,040
Rock, paper, scissors.

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,399
How do you do the thumb?

122
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,050
How do you do the thumb?

123
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,139
Whoa.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
What?

125
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,519
I just teleported.

126
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,160
How do you do the thumb?

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,439
How do you do the thumb?

128
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,569
It's different on Vive controllers.

129
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:42,970
I don't know.

130
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,379
Why do you have like a better VR system than me?

131
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,149
No, I'm just taller.

132
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:54,980
That's bullshit.

133
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,500
I know what's going on here.

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,259
This is exactly what's fucking happening.

135
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,019
You have your Oculus, by the way.

136
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,699
Oculus is like the platform

137
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,259
you shouldn't be on.

138
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,540
You should be on the HTC Vive

139
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,500
just in case you were wondering.

140
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,339
You have, wait.

141
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,100
Press the start button on the scoreboard to plan.

142
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,819
Are you just sad?

143
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,259
It gives you random faces.

144
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,180
Oh, I thought you were like crying or something.

145
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
Your character is just doing like a constant

146
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,259
I'm talking, listen to me, I'm important.

147
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,160
Wait, can I get down here to your size?

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,439
No, that's bullshit.

149
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,639
You have your two lighthouses on huge like cranes.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm honestly sitting on the ground.

151
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,319
Yeah, it's because I have my setup correct

152
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,600
and your setup is fucked up.

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
You're not this tall.

154
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,199
You're not like 10 feet tall.

155
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,839
Give me a hug.

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,000
You're like Andre the giant.

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,439
All right, let's go.

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Majestic squirrel versus hasty octopus.

159
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,040
Which one's you?

160
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,199
I'm majestic squirrel.

161
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,279
Dude, you are so big.

162
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,439
This is not, I can't do it like this.

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,720
Can you move your lighthouses down like five feet?

164
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,920
How do you play?

165
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,199
What?

166
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,879
Why did that just pop up?

167
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,160
How do I like turn this off?

168
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,600
I don't, what?

169
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,399
Hey, just again, one of my mods is playing TF2

170
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,199
in case you were curious.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
All right, so we got-

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,199
Oh, I think I got, I don't know the rules.

173
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,439
It's just, it's like a just big, it's small tennis.

174
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,199
Small tennis.

175
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,699
Yeah.

176
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,389
I can't get over how fucking huge you are.

177
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:26,870
That's not.

178
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,750
All right, I wouldn't, why is there no sound?

179
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,750
It's coming over here.

180
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,389
I need like a bit more audio.

181
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,269
It's like just music.

182
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,539
All right.

183
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,740
All right.

184
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,299
How do I turn?

185
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,559
I don't have sound.

186
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,840
That's just music.

187
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,559
What the fuck?

188
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,139
See, it's, did you just score off me right now?

189
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,340
I don't know.

190
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:00,570
Wait.

191
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,820
Jolly green giant over here.

192
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,539
Oh my God.

193
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,159
This game, hold on.

194
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,639
Wait, wait, wait.

195
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,360
How do I turn it off?

196
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,559
How do I make the sounds better?

197
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,789
Just, can you just wait until we can get out of the tutorial?

198
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:22,549
Oh, sure.

199
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,230
So we can just play Jeopardy for God's sake.

200
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,990
I'm going to hit this as hard as I fucking can.

201
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,789
I hope you're ready for that.

202
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,789
Can I like grab it first?

203
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,070
Where am I in my room?

204
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:37,990
Am I near like a wall?

205
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,490
Which wall is back here?

206
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,000
You're okay?

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,320
All right.

208
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,840
Let's go.

209
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,409
Match point.

210
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,700
This is too hard.

211
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,740
I hit that.

212
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,860
It's too hard.

213
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,340
All right.

214
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,100
Can we thank congratulations?

215
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,179
We did it.

216
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,779
I got a present.

217
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,340
What is it?

218
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:15,379
Open.

219
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,740
I need to level up some more to use this item.

220
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,419
You got an exclamation point.

221
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:20,820
Good for you.

222
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,169
I get another one?

223
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:27,210
That's pretty satisfying.

224
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,409
That's kind of satisfying.

225
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,340
50 tokens.

226
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,000
What did you get?

227
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,000
I got 50 tokens.

228
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,110
I can't.

229
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,389
How do I do thumbs up?

230
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,700
Violet, why are you dressed like an opera singer?

231
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,820
What?

232
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,220
You got a tank top on.

233
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,700
Yeah, I do.

234
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Do it alone.

235
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,220
Yeah, I do.

236
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,750
How do I leave?

237
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,960
I think we're stuck here opening boxes for another hour.

238
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Are we?

239
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,279
There's a door right there.

240
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,830
Should we leave?

241
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,330
Oh, you have walking on.

242
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,049
You're advanced.

243
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,190
Yeah, I'm going to throw up.

244
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,750
By the way, this makes me throw up.

245
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,659
Stock button.

246
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,700
No, I don't want to do that again.

247
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,259
Does our watch have a thing?

248
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,139
No, there we go.

249
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,710
Wait, wait, wait.

250
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,509
Okay, challenges.

251
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:36,789
It wants us to do a challenge now.

252
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:39,399
But what about this room?

253
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,539
This is a store?

254
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,789
Wait, let me turn this.

255
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,389
I need to have the music down.

256
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,509
The sounds are going to go up.

257
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,259
What happened?

258
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,220
What are you doing?

259
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,899
I sent you a friend request.

260
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,019
You sent me a package.

261
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,820
Oh, that's my package.

262
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,940
That's my box because I completed the challenge to make friends with you.

263
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,299
No one else could do it.

264
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:12,200
But look, I got another one.

265
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,960
Complete one game in paddle ball daily.

266
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Will you stop spraying the coins on me?

267
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,000
All right.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,639
Who gives a shit?

269
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,639
Press the start button on the scoreboard to play.

270
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,620
Let's go.

271
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,179
Okay, play.

272
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:29,940
All right, all right, all right.

273
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,139
Can we pick some of the same thing?

274
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,860
Let's put it like bowling or something.

275
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,409
This is just Roblox.

276
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:39,769
Yeah.

277
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,450
Did you accept my friend request?

278
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:41,929
I don't know.

279
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:42,250
Did I?

280
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:43,500
People?

281
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,179
I have a message from you.

282
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,139
Let's open it.

283
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,100
That's from me.

284
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,620
I accept your friend request.

285
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,100
Yes.

286
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,340
Okay.

287
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,059
We're friends now.

288
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,340
So.

289
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,659
Yay.

290
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,870
All right.

291
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,190
Play.

292
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,360
We're always going to jump into one of these.

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
How about the streets?

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,879
Okay.

295
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,399
I just clicked on something called the streets.

296
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,120
I don't know what this is.

297
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,399
You're gone.

298
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,399
Click on the streets.

299
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,179
It's like the second page.

300
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:14,500
Okay.

301
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,600
Why is this all screwed up?

302
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,320
No shit.

303
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,980
This is like a fucking PVP room.

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,899
We're going to be throwing up on the streets.

305
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,230
How do I?

306
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,110
See, look at how fucking huge you are.

307
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,309
You are way too big.

308
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,389
Everybody else is normal.

309
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,250
This person can hear me talking, right?

310
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,220
Did you mute your mic?

311
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,019
I'm like, why am I spying on what she's writing?

312
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,779
That was so odd.

313
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,019
Okay.

314
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,139
I have a new notification.

315
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:50,299
What?

316
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,980
Are we kicking me out?

317
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,750
Everybody has boxes and shit.

318
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,990
All right.

319
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,070
Let's just go to the PVP area.

320
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:08,620
I don't know what this does.

321
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,220
I'm going out.

322
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,700
You coming?

323
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,299
I'm out.

324
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,509
What?

325
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:17,110
There's people shooting lasers at me.

326
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,250
I got to kill them.

327
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,649
I got them.

328
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,980
We killed each other.

329
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,539
I'm alive.

330
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,700
Power weapon refreshed.

331
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,580
This is Roblox.

332
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,379
That guy has a sword and a shield.

333
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,830
I like handball better.

334
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,759
That's what gamers are being so violent.

335
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, I just heard a scream.

336
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,059
So I got killed.

337
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,429
Where are the weapons?

338
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,220
This is a water fountain?

339
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,220
I think that kid might actually be running around in his house.

340
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,159
This is a big house.

341
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:21,320
All right.

342
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,639
Good guy.

343
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,360
Come in.

344
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,840
Come in here.

345
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:25,269
Walk in.

346
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,830
Unlock door.

347
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,490
I'm absolutely lost.

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,799
Should I not have done that?

349
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,399
Hey, come into the door.

350
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,279
There's a door over here.

351
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,580
Do you see the door in the building?

352
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:46,899
There's the buildings everywhere.

353
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,059
I know.

354
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,419
But there's a locked door.

355
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,460
I can't even communicate because you're in the head.

356
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,350
I always die.

357
00:15:59,129 --> 00:15:59,610
Come on.

358
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,169
Am I a prisoner right now?

359
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:08,730
I've somehow become a prisoner in here.

360
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,370
You have to help me.

361
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,840
They're absolutely ruthless in here.

362
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,039
What color is the house?

363
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,399
It's blue on the inside.

364
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,519
I don't know what it looks like on the outside.

365
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,110
They're fucking torturing me in here.

366
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:23,429
Come in.

367
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:23,830
Get in here.

368
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,299
Don't be a threat.

369
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,250
Is that you opening the door?

370
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,529
Yeah, I don't own this PlayStation right now.

371
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,330
It's my friend's.

372
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,009
But I'm playing on a VR.

373
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:45,740
So they haven't even turned around to look.

374
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,299
At what point is he going to turn around and be like,

375
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,100
what are you doing, man?

376
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,200
I need to hold on a second.

377
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,840
Whoa, what?

378
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,359
Hey, he saw me go off my watch.

379
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,480
He saw me go off my watch and he fucking shot me.

380
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,079
I was going to try to communicate.

381
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,740
New notification.

382
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,779
Where are you?

383
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,039
I just got to the blue house.

384
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,440
No, no, no.

385
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,880
It's called Tony's Gun Store.

386
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,599
Tony's Gun Store.

387
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,400
He went to the wrong place.

388
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,539
Tony's going to Tony's Gun Store.

389
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,829
How have I not been hit?

390
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,240
Are you at Tony's Gun Shop yet?

391
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,799
I'm stuck inside the blue house.

392
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,329
I think I hit like four.

393
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:50,329
All right, I'm turning voice chat on for a second here.

394
00:17:51,289 --> 00:18:07,700
Hey, let me in, let me in, let me in, man.

395
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
Let me in, let me in.

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,380
Hey, let me in, man, let me in.

397
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,900
There's wild people here shooting at me, man.

398
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,619
Let me in.

399
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,740
Oh, thank God I made it in.

400
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,819
People out there shooting at us.

401
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,509
What the heck?

402
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,230
I don't want to, I'm just, I'm going to, I'm a prisoner.

403
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,390
I'm a prisoner.

404
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,670
I don't, I'm not going to do anything.

405
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,630
I can't shoot you.

406
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,430
I'm not going to do anything.

407
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,430
I'm not going to do anything.

408
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,789
What happened?

409
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,170
Oh, shit.

410
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,569
Jesus.

411
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm just going to hang out behind the houses and throw up in the grass.

412
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,390
Okay.

413
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,230
Don't, no, no, no, no, don't do it.

414
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:32,890
All right, can we do something else?

415
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,490
Please.

416
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,529
I'm waiting for you.

417
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,490
Can we do something else?

418
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,410
This is your show.

419
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,049
This is your show.

420
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,089
All right, let's go.

421
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:42,730
Get out of here.

422
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,170
Go to play.

423
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:51,299
And, uh, can we, how do we, let's go bowling.

424
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:51,940
I see bowling.

425
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,660
Let's play bowling.

426
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,980
You and me.

427
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,859
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

428
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,619
Can we like, you want to get out of here?

429
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:56,420
A friend group?

430
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,259
Do, can we?

431
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,269
Ready to start.

432
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,230
I don't think there's anybody here.

433
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,390
Oh shit, there's somebody here.

434
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,289
Oh shit.

435
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:12,650
All right, I think we have our own lane though.

436
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:18,170
This is like a general bowling alley.

437
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,930
On the friend page you can click go to.

438
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,329
Sending me to you.

439
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,369
And we can be friends.

440
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,289
I'm right behind you.

441
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,490
Wow, let's me sneak in.

442
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,049
I don't know, man.

443
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:27,690
I got nothing.

444
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,170
I got nothing.

445
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,720
I don't know.

446
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,519
It's a different game mode.

447
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:30,920
All right.

448
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,119
Um, should we just?

449
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,400
Hey, Jeremy, your pee pee small.

450
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,779
Where's Jeremy?

451
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,220
How the fuck would they even know?

452
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,779
God damn it.

453
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:41,099
How do I?

454
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,819
Because you've been here for 10 seconds.

455
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,819
We didn't go that way.

456
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,259
And we're doing that one.

457
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,099
Let me show you guys a thing or two in a hole.

458
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:54,819
Where's Star?

459
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:55,220
Get over here.

460
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,339
Where are you?

461
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,430
We just ordered a pizza on the scoreboard to play.

462
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to get a strike.

463
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:17,849
Oh, he's so lost.

464
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,740
He's so lost that he has no idea what he's doing.

465
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,740
Do we have to be in different lanes?

466
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,099
All right, let's take the one over here.

467
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,900
We maybe maybe we should just do our own private lobby.

468
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,740
That's what I'm figuring.

469
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,220
I'm going to do.

470
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,380
God damn it.

471
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,420
I'm fucking going to get hurt.

472
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,200
Do we can do private.

473
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
We're going to do private.

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,640
We'll do private.

475
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,119
All right, get out of here.

476
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,920
All right, I think I made a room.

477
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
I don't know if it's private.

478
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
OK, you made a room.

479
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,640
People.

480
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,559
And then on friends, you can do go to mains.

481
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh, yeah, this is private.

482
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,160
OK, hopefully that's not like the password.

483
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,400
I hope that's not the password.

484
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,150
What is this person doing?

485
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:13,940
Get out of here.

486
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,700
Get away from me.

487
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,819
All right, how do I join?

488
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,609
All right, go to people.

489
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,809
I just subscribe to you.

490
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,089
I just subscribe to you.

491
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,109
I've invited you.

492
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,559
No, that's inventions.

493
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,190
Am I stupid?

494
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,269
Yes.

495
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,789
All right, I see.

496
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:43,589
OK, messages.

497
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,190
Game invite.

498
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,430
Open.

499
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:46,789
Do you want?

500
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:47,509
Yes, let's go.

501
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:52,519
OK, look, God.

502
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,119
Hey, there you are.

503
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:03,000
Hey, I reserved the entire bowling alley.

504
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,119
So we could be friends.

505
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,079
He's a billionaire.

506
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,039
He's a millionaire.

507
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,079
He's a millionaire.

508
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,049
All right, you ready to bowl for real?

509
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

510
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,819
He's trying to pick up the chair.

511
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,259
I'm trying to pick it up.

512
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,380
Can we play pool, too?

513
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,660
Wow, you are really short.

514
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,259
No, have you just noticed that you're a monster in every single lobby?

515
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,579
You're just a gigantic person.

516
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,380
I wouldn't be surprised if you.

517
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,400
He's going to start a VR fight.

518
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,529
We got that coming up later.

519
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,450
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you something.

520
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,009
You want to stick around because we've got a fun fighting game.

521
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:50,650
What did I just do?

522
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:53,740
Who's turn is it?

523
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:03,500
Um, I'm not that you're really just making this so hard for me.

524
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Me?

525
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,299
Why?

526
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,619
Why couldn't you have known that you were going to be on my live stream?

527
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,859
You could have brought your lighthouses down two feet.

528
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,220
I don't know what that means.

529
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,339
How do you pick up a ball?

530
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,940
Do you have a ball?

531
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,539
No, I don't know.

532
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:24,339
I have no idea.

533
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,900
How does anyone figure out this game?

534
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,099
Okay, literal children are playing this right now.

535
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:30,660
You understand?

536
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,619
We're adults.

537
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:32,500
We have to figure this out.

538
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,220
But first, I'm going to get a drink.

539
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,779
Paul, there's a bowling shirt.

540
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:39,500
Hold on.

541
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:39,900
What's this?

542
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:41,259
Coffee or something?

543
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,880
Free donuts?

544
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,240
Yay.

545
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,910
What does that mean?

546
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,190
You want a slice?

547
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,470
There's a wall there.

548
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,130
He's like looking in the instructional manual.

549
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,769
How do we play the game?

550
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,609
It says practice.

551
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,089
It says game in progress, but it says practice.

552
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,599
I got to turn this off.

553
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,180
How do I disable notifications?

554
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:19,660
Personal space.

555
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,940
Ignore bubble.

556
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,500
Okay, that's good.

557
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,380
All right.

558
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,180
Did you figure it out?

559
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,579
I mean, it should be my turn.

560
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:30,779
There's just no balls.

561
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,099
All right, guys.

562
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:31,819
What are we doing wrong?

563
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,329
What are we doing wrong?

564
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,140
I think we're playing rec room.

565
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,740
Well, let's see.

566
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,099
Maybe somebody says no clue.

567
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:47,819
We need balls.

568
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,400
We need to do an official game mode.

569
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,200
Just run down and kick the pin.

570
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,880
You can't.

571
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,680
I tried.

572
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,259
Did you like press a button over here?

573
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,089
We both had to press start.

574
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,960
I pressed start.

575
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,579
What's that?

576
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,430
Uh, you're the host.

577
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:25,240
These two old fucks lost in a kids game.

578
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,210
You have an idea?

579
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,450
Oh, you lost.

580
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:30,569
Who won?

581
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,170
I found out how to end the game.

582
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,690
Okay, this is FFA sandbox.

583
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,970
That's the problem that we're having here.

584
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,329
We don't want to do sandbox.

585
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:44,359
Two team, just you versus me.

586
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,640
Not free for all sandbox.

587
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,440
Me, two teams.

588
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,240
Two team sandbox.

589
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Me versus you.

590
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,720
Game starts in three seconds.

591
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,119
Here we go.

592
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,039
Game on.

593
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:56,730
All right.

594
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,450
Who's up first?

595
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,730
Me.

596
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:10,170
Like, dude, I bet this is like you need to buy the ball and have it in your inventory.

597
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,410
You definitely don't have to buy the ball.

598
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,769
No, you have to buy the ball.

599
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,900
The balls are in the front?

600
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:31,930
Balls in the front?

601
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,740
Like in the lockers?

602
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,269
Uh, somebody said under tail front.

603
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,150
Under tail front.

604
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,859
Hey, we're not in the bowling game mode.

605
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:52,380
We're in the bowling room.

606
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:54,900
Well, what's the difference?

607
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,380
I don't know.

608
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,980
I guess this is like not the bowling game.

609
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,220
This is like the hang out with your friends in the bowling alley.

610
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,019
But it goes somewhere different.

611
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:03,740
Take it somewhere.

612
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,140
I don't know.

613
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,420
We're not going to have bowling shoes on.

614
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:11,769
Whatever.

615
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,890
Just go on our bare feet.

616
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:14,339
We'll be fine.

617
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:20,980
To your right.

618
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:24,539
Wait, wait, wait.

619
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,339
Don't do anything yet.

620
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:25,740
Stop it.

621
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,630
Is that activated?

622
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,519
No, that didn't do it.

623
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,400
No, no, no.

624
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,039
Just go.

625
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,480
Just get the fuck out of here.

626
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,119
No, that was wrong.

627
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,119
Like, like walk through here to activate.

628
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,500
I'm just going to like put your head down in there.

629
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,730
Can I see what you're doing?

630
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:53,930
No.

631
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,869
I don't know what's going to make these any different.

632
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,289
We're just going to be in a room.

633
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,390
To create a private room, open your watch and press on play.

634
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,029
Then find the room you want to create a private version of.

635
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:16,869
Afterwards, instead of clicking the icon, click the exclamation button.

636
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,269
Close that.

637
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,829
I missed it.

638
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:27,420
It looks like an old motherfucker on an iPad.

639
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,500
That's like what my grandfather does when he's on his iPhone.

640
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,519
Like, oh, you're not going to send a text.

641
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,220
We good?

642
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:38,579
No.

643
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,940
All right, hold on.

644
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,220
Click the, close the name of the room.

645
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,500
Then press on private.

646
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,869
And voila, you now have a private room.

647
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,069
I'm thinking, I'm close.

648
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:50,549
I'm getting close.

649
00:29:51,430 --> 00:30:00,150
Does somebody just said I'm the most obnoxious streamer on Twitch?

650
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,130
It's, that's not true.

651
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,470
Why?

652
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,670
What did I, what did I do?

653
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,720
You couldn't figure out how to play bowling.

654
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,460
Well, dude, I'm following the instructions and they're.

655
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:24,940
Let me see what happens when I, let me think of it to try.

656
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm a little like, I'm a little younger than you.

657
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,220
So yeah.

658
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:29,420
Okay.

659
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,059
Let's see here.

660
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:41,559
You're not, but I got it.

661
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,359
Me and you dodgeball.

662
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,160
Let's go for real.

663
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,740
I'm going to invite you.

664
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,420
I figured it out in 10 seconds.

665
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,700
Oh my God.

666
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,619
If you like, you can practice until more players arrive.

667
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:53,619
Waiting for the invite.

668
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,319
Come on in.

669
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:08,859
I would kind of already did this, but with a paddle.

670
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,099
All right.

671
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:12,059
We're on different teams, right?

672
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:12,859
But no.

673
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:13,819
Ready to start.

674
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:14,619
Why did you just do that?

675
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,019
You and I are on the same side of the court.

676
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,259
What color is your shirt?

677
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,059
I can't see my own shirt.

678
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:22,619
You're blue.

679
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,180
All right, here we go.

680
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,500
You ready?

681
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,500
Dodgeball.

682
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,640
Put away.

683
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,730
I punched him by.

684
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:44,299
All right.

685
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,220
Can I get that one?

686
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,460
No.

687
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,440
You don't have legs that went through you.

688
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,220
We don't have any more balls.

689
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,299
Okay.

690
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,500
Here it comes.

691
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:06,980
You ready?

692
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,940
I'm going to hit something.

693
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,779
How do these go slower than the paddle ball?

694
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,740
I don't know, but how can we not do this?

695
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
Why are we so awful at this?

696
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,380
There's no way you could hit me.

697
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,420
Who's doing the move?

698
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:33,059
You're doing a doggy paddle.

699
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:35,509
Don't fear.

700
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:36,390
You can teleport.

701
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,059
That's the BS.

702
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:38,779
Like that block?

703
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:40,299
That's too convenient.

704
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,720
All right.

705
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,359
Now you're fucked.

706
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:50,680
Ready?

707
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,759
Can you not catch?

708
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:05,769
Here, here.

709
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:06,890
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

710
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,289
Wait.

711
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,529
If I was 11, this would be the most fun I've ever had.

712
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:09,769
Wait.

713
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:12,410
I said wait.

714
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,410
I'm going to toss it up gently and try and catch it.

715
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,130
Okay.

716
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,369
Okay.

717
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,390
I didn't know that was real.

718
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,130
Okay.

719
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:25,849
You can catch it.

720
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,779
Oh, look at that.

721
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:28,660
Oh, what do you know?

722
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,539
Spin it around a little bit.

723
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,940
It's so loud.

724
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:44,940
It shouldn't be.

725
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,740
Come on.

726
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:06,359
Why would I do that?

727
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,460
Hey, under that.

728
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,070
All right.

729
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,230
Are you sick?

730
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,710
Are you sick?

731
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,110
This is the worst game of dodgeball you've ever played.

732
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:27,800
Can you hit yourself in the face?

733
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,639
Oh, fuck.

734
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,219
How many, hey, how many times have you ran into like your desk?

735
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,400
Not once.

736
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,409
Next.

737
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,309
Tell me, check one.

738
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:52,949
Let's get one more.

739
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:55,289
Next.

740
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,809
We didn't spend no money to not get out of here in 15 seconds.

741
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,420
I mean different game.

742
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,309
Like, not dodgeball.

743
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,829
Okay.

744
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:06,230
Uh-huh.

745
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,860
Never have I ever.

746
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,539
Rec room restaurant.

747
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:12,260
Rec restaurant.

748
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,980
That's what we're doing.

749
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,300
Shit.

750
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:14,820
I went to the public one.

751
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,980
It's just going to be a hangout.

752
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,940
I got to move this.

753
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,019
I went to a public restaurant.

754
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,449
Big mistake.

755
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:40,679
You seem actually fucking hanging out in here.

756
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,920
Pretending to be in a cafeteria.

757
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:01,940
Come over here.

758
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:04,900
Hold on.

759
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,539
Put your mic on.

760
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,619
It's going to sound terrible, but we need to.

761
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,739
So this is the place I was talking about.

762
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,059
They got pretty good burgers here.

763
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,219
They got an excellent, excellent garlic aioli that goes on top of it, too.

764
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:21,780
It's pretty great.

765
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,409
Did you do use open table to get us a reservation here?

766
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:28,170
No.

767
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,369
Okay.

768
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,719
Okay.

769
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,679
Let's go ahead and just...

770
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,960
That's a snowman.

771
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,599
Excuse me?

772
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,800
Does anybody work here?

773
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:43,849
Oh.

774
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,849
Hey, you should be his new boss.

775
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:49,050
He has lots of restaurant experience this guy.

776
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,769
He runs Michelin star restaurants.

777
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:54,420
Oh, that's great because this place is in a state of disrepair.

778
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,699
It's complete chaos here.

779
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:57,699
Wait, who needs menus?

780
00:36:58,659 --> 00:36:59,219
Oh, okay.

781
00:36:59,219 --> 00:36:59,539
Let me see.

782
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,619
No, that's okay.

783
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,900
I know it's your first day.

784
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,940
I believe they do.

785
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,739
I need the menus.

786
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,139
Wait, do you work here?

787
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:07,380
Okay.

788
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:12,019
Burger minus steak equals pizza.

789
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:17,909
Can we just throw a brick through the window?

790
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:23,369
Okay.

791
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:26,809
Uh, I think...

792
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,050
Can I get just a glass of water?

793
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,889
Can I just get a glass of water?

794
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,369
No, that's okay.

795
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,650
That's okay.

796
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,130
Everything going?

797
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,090
Everything okay back here?

798
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:43,929
Can you pick a table?

799
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,610
Because you're blocking the way.

800
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,530
I think we need to get seated.

801
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,889
Oh, that's the VIP table.

802
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,010
What do you want, sir?

803
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,570
Let you sit.

804
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,610
Anyone want to sit?

805
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:55,929
Sit.

806
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:59,849
Uh, that candle is made for any of the other tables you see here.

807
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,289
Guys, what do you want?

808
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,210
So I heard about this place on Yelp.

809
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,530
I come to New City, and I try to go to Yelp when I go to the top 10 on Yelp,

810
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,489
and this was number two.

811
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,050
So we're, you know, really hoping for big things here.

812
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,139
So I guess, uh, you ready to order?

813
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,739
Because I looked at the extensive menu that you guys have.

814
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,739
Anyone want a candle?

815
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,980
I think I will have...

816
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,179
I got it under control here.

817
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,179
I think I'm going to have the, uh, the hamburger here.

818
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,420
Can I get that medium, please?

819
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,539
No, I'm sorry.

820
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:35,420
I'm so sorry.

821
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,420
Sorry what?

822
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,940
You can order here if you want.

823
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,500
I'm going to, uh, check our stock real quick.

824
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:44,139
It's okay.

825
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,099
It's, uh, it's all right.

826
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:45,980
Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,460
It's okay.

828
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,340
I'm doing okay.

829
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,780
I can't, I don't know how to sit down.

830
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:50,780
I need you first.

831
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,280
Okay.

832
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:53,179
You're standing on the seat.

833
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:53,679
What are you doing?

834
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,179
I'm standing on the seat.

835
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:56,679
Oh, okay.

836
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,179
Hold me.

837
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:57,679
Hang on.

838
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,179
Let me...

839
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,179
Can I help you?

840
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:02,679
I'm not supposed to be doing this at three and a half on Yelp so far.

841
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,179
You ever do a SlavSquad?

842
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:04,679
Yeah.

843
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,679
Sir, can I help you?

844
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,179
That is one short streamer.

845
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:07,679
There we go.

846
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,679
That's just SlavSquad.

847
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,679
Who said that?

848
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,679
It's just nice.

849
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,679
Don't bloody throw cards.

850
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,179
Please do not insult our guests.

851
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:14,679
Don't throw cards.

852
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,239
Do you know what you're going to order?

853
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,239
Don't throw cards.

854
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,239
Because I ordered a hamburger and we got a fucking pizza.

855
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:21,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

856
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:22,739
I probably shouldn't have said that.

857
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:24,739
I want the Bean Eagles pizza.

858
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,909
That employee.

859
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:29,909
You're going to have to talk about this employee.

860
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,909
Because that was like the mistake number five.

861
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,909
It's okay. I work here.

862
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:37,219
Well, it's now two.

863
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:39,219
Can I get some fireman's and chat?

864
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,219
But it's okay.

865
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,219
How are you sitting?

866
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,219
I sat down in my room.

867
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,219
Okay, so...

868
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,940
What happened to my mug?

869
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,570
You know what?

870
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,070
No, no, no.

871
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,070
I want to see the kitchen.

872
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,570
I want to see the kitchen.

873
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,130
Damn it.

874
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,130
I want to see the kitchen.

875
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,130
Oh, shit.

876
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,130
Oh, God.

877
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,130
Somebody call the police.

878
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,130
I'm sorry.

879
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,619
I hit the table.

880
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:10,619
Oh, my God.

881
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,250
Who is sitting this close to me?

882
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,250
What's going on?

883
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,250
You took a photo of me in the restaurant?

884
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,250
Yeah.

885
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,250
Yeah.

886
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,250
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,250
I mean, you could have asked permission for it.

888
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,250
Like all these cameras.

889
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,250
Can you believe this?

890
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,250
This is ridiculous.

891
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,250
We're just being followed.

892
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,250
I don't believe it.

893
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,250
We're being robbed.

894
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,250
Give the pizza burger back.

895
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,739
Jesus.

896
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,179
If I don't get a pizza burger back...

897
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:36,179
I'm trying to enjoy my meal.

898
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:39,179
Help me get the burger back.

899
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,179
All right.

900
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,179
It's probably time to call the police.

901
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,179
So I'll see you anyway.

902
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,179
Don't say, oh, my God.

903
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,179
Yeah.

904
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,179
Let's go to the police.

905
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,179
Does anyone have a...

906
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,179
I don't know how to...

907
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,179
It's my watch.

908
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,179
Oh, hey, look.

909
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,179
I got a camera.

910
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:51,179
I can't be in there.

911
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:52,179
Unbelievable.

912
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:53,179
Chug, chug, chug.

913
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,179
Did anyone order pizza anyway?

914
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:58,179
Like I'll have a half-eaten pizza.

915
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,179
Half-eaten slice?

916
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:00,179
Like...

917
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:02,179
Half-eaten slice, anyone?

918
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,179
Woo-hoo!

919
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,179
Oh, I just ripped the corner.

920
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,179
All right, can we...

921
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,179
I don't...

922
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,179
Can we...

923
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,179
Is this what I looked like?

924
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,179
Why do I look like Doug Fuddy?

925
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,179
I ordered the hamburger.

926
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,179
I ordered the hamburger.

927
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,179
It was me.

928
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:26,179
Sorry.

929
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:30,179
There's a piece of cheese and two pieces of bread.

930
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:36,349
Did you even try, mate?

931
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:37,349
Look at this.

932
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:38,349
Look at this.

933
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:42,590
A slice of cheese.

934
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,590
That's all that's in there.

935
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,590
Fucking rubbish.

936
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:50,789
Did you just take that from me?

937
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:53,789
Stop swearing!

938
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:54,789
My voice cracked.

939
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:56,789
Oh, sorry.

940
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't have access.

941
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,250
I paid in...

942
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,619
I paid in photos.

943
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,940
Yeah, I'm out.

944
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
You paid in exposure.

945
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Exposure.

946
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:47,289
How do I get out of here?

947
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:51,769
All right, are we moving on?

948
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,010
I don't know.

949
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,010
Were there any other actual games?

950
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,010
We can go to featured games.

951
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,570
There's Paintball, Golden Trophy, The Streets, Newtown, Reborn.

952
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,280
We did a couple of these.

953
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Hide and Seek?

954
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,289
You want to play Hide and Seek?

955
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,289
Just me and you?

956
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,289
Oh my god, no.

957
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:17,659
Lemonade Simulator?

958
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:23,739
There's Minigolf.

959
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,039
Oh, Minigolf!

960
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,039
I don't want to play that game.

961
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,039
Minigolf is...

962
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,039
I don't think it's very fun.

963
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
What do you guys think?

964
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,059
I don't know why you can't make a private one.

965
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,159
Everyone's screaming to do Minigolf.

966
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:48,909
Do Furry Hangout.

967
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:49,909
What are you talking about?

968
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,730
No, I ain't doing that.

969
00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:02,539
All right, let's do Slender Eight Pages.

970
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:07,610
That would be on here.

971
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,610
You're going to do Slender Man Eight Pages?

972
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,849
I'll follow you.

973
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:13,849
Does somebody get to be Slender Man?

974
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:14,849
It would be you.

975
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,010
I'm done being tall.

976
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:23,809
How do we start?

977
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:27,099
Can't run.

978
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,099
Always watch us.

979
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,099
Don't look.

980
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,780
If I can't join you, it says game full.

981
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,389
Really?

982
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:36,389
Come up.

983
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:40,210
I actually think it's only two people get into the woods.

984
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,210
Just me and you.

985
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,710
Yeah, it's just me.

986
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,710
There we go.

987
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,710
All right.

988
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,710
Only two can enter.

989
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,710
Hey.

990
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,710
Hey.

991
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,710
What's going on?

992
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,710
How does it feel being up there?

993
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,710
Feels pretty good.

994
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,710
Why can I not hit you on the head?

995
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,710
Because this is a non-violent game.

996
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:04,139
The only thing you can do is...

997
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,380
Okay, that was funny.

998
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,380
Why did that happen?

999
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,380
All right, before you go,

1000
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:17,849
do you want to press this button or what do we do?

1001
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,530
What are you doing?

1002
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,530
No, we didn't even read the rules.

1003
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,530
What are you doing?

1004
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,070
You didn't even let me read the rules.

1005
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:41,010
I'm in.

1006
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,590
Where are you?

1007
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,590
Throw me a flashlight.

1008
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,590
Get a flashlight.

1009
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,590
Throw me one.

1010
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,590
I'll throw it to you.

1011
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,969
Hold on.

1012
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:53,969
You have to come get it.

1013
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:54,969
I can't throw it to you.

1014
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,139
This isn't even doing anything.

1015
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:58,139
This just hurts.

1016
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:00,139
This is just like a filter on the screen.

1017
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:03,300
Here.

1018
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,440
All right.

1019
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
This is bad.

1020
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,440
This is...

1021
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
I kind of don't want the flashlight.

1022
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
Thanks.

1023
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,780
You just put that right in my face.

1024
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,780
All right, let's go.

1025
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:20,869
So we can find the first page.

1026
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:22,690
I'm going to welcome that.

1027
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,699
I think your voice is still coming through.

1028
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,010
Oh, yeah.

1029
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,010
I can turn that off.

1030
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,210
Yeah, you definitely should.

1031
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,340
Okay.

1032
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,710
You ready to go find the eight pages?

1033
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,710
Yeah.

1034
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,530
I wish there was a camera on you right now

1035
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,530
because I'd love to know what the hell you're doing.

1036
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,019
I'm crawling.

1037
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,079
I need you.

1038
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,079
Will you stand up and just play?

1039
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,079
You are ruining my street.

1040
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:07,840
Let's hit it.

1041
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,550
Let's go.

1042
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:16,119
Hey, behind you, there might be a...

1043
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,119
Is there a page?

1044
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,119
Over there.

1045
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,119
Like...

1046
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,119
He really is right here.

1047
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,920
This is not the Kingdom Hearts version of this character.

1048
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,269
As long as the flashlight's on him, we can not move.

1049
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,269
Look at how muscular his legs are.

1050
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,269
He looks a little inflated.

1051
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:38,219
You know those things on Halloween?

1052
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:41,219
That big display that you walk by and they go...

1053
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,219
And they say like a line about eating you.

1054
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:47,219
That's what this thing is.

1055
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:55,539
He's going to get you.

1056
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,989
I don't think he will.

1057
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,860
He's ignoring you.

1058
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,860
Wait, wait, wait.

1059
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,420
Go get him.

1060
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,420
What is he doing?

1061
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,300
Let's follow him.

1062
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Alright, yeah, we gotta follow him.

1063
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:16,820
Hey.

1064
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,820
Is he collecting the notes now?

1065
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,019
Is it his turn?

1066
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,019
Yeah, we're the annoying ones.

1067
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:31,989
Okay, that's a little odd.

1068
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:38,070
This is scarier somehow.

1069
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,070
Upbeat.

1070
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,070
Daddy, upbeat.

1071
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,780
Just have him grab you in the face.

1072
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
I tried to.

1073
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,579
I think he killed me.

1074
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:55,820
He killed you.

1075
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,309
I was going to say, maybe we get to trap him like a Ghostbusters proton beam.

1076
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,739
How long have we been in rec room for?

1077
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,739
We've got like four or five other games to play.

1078
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,739
Yeah.

1079
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,739
What's next?

1080
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:13,739
What do you want to do next?

1081
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:16,039
I don't remember the list.

1082
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,980
Neither do I.

1083
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,170
We can do Survive.

1084
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,170
What do you want to do?

1085
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,170
That is the only one that I did not download.

1086
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,170
Why didn't you download that?

1087
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,469
It wouldn't start and then I just figured, I figured it'd be fine.

1088
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:37,469
You didn't download the game, like the co-op horror shooter game.

1089
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:39,469
It could start.

1090
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,610
Well, start downloading now and we'll play.

1091
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:48,610
Alright, guys, I got some really, really interesting news for everybody.

1092
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,610
The last thing that we're going to play is Desert Bus VR.

1093
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,610
So we're going to try to take the whole eight hour trip at the end of the stream.

1094
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,610
Oh, wow.

1095
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,610
Star really ruined the stream.

1096
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:08,650
Dude, just go to the furry room.

1097
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,460
I'll be done downloading in a second.

1098
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Oh my God.

1099
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,460
No, dude, I don't want to.

1100
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,090
You get 15 seconds, okay?

1101
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,090
10 seconds.

1102
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:26,170
It's just three minutes to download.

1103
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,619
My mic turned the fuck off.

1104
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,210
Three minutes.

1105
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,210
I thought I just did that for a second.

1106
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,579
That was weird.

1107
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:36,579
Pretty good.

1108
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:38,579
I'm just going to go and look and I'm going to go and look.

1109
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:39,579
I just got pressured.

1110
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,519
Alright, you get 15 seconds.

1111
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:47,699
I don't care if you're a furry.

1112
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:48,699
It's not a problem.

1113
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:50,389
I don't give a shit.

1114
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,019
I don't care if you're furry.

1115
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:56,659
I just don't want to see you.

1116
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,659
How did you know I was going to go there?

1117
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:03,780
Well, the iron giant is really cool.

1118
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
I'll tell you.

1119
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,780
My favorite part about this is the iron giant.

1120
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:13,760
Is that the iron giant?

1121
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,219
It is.

1122
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,219
Nice.

1123
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,219
Okay.

1124
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:22,219
Can I come up here?

1125
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:23,219
No.

1126
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,219
Okay.

1127
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:25,780
It is.

1128
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,429
Nice.

1129
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:29,429
Okay.

1130
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:32,570
Can I come up here and spin records?

1131
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:39,250
How do I turn this on?

1132
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:48,309
I think I have to have special DJ permission to use this.

1133
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:52,130
That's a pretty cool Spyro the dragon costume.

1134
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,130
I want to see it.

1135
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:58,219
That's a pretty awesome Spyro the dragon.

1136
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:07,760
Spyro and then I don't know what that other one is.

1137
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,150
What's going on?

1138
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,150
Is this stuff going on up here?

1139
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,030
That's a VIP area.

1140
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,030
You can't go up there unless you're VIP.

1141
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,030
I'm going to respect the rules.

1142
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,030
Here's the newest costumes.

1143
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,030
Okay.

1144
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,420
Spyro the dragon.

1145
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,420
What did I tell you?

1146
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:32,829
Uh oh.

1147
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:35,929
All right.

1148
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:38,809
Survive is I'm launching it.

1149
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:42,110
Am I stealing a costume?

1150
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,929
I think I'm actually, I think I'm taking this.

1151
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,929
No, I got to put this back.

1152
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:47,929
It's that.

1153
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:52,179
All right.

1154
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:53,179
You're launching it?

1155
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:54,480
Yeah.

1156
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,480
There you go.

1157
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,480
There's your 15 seconds.

1158
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:09,300
Okay.

1159
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,360
How do I get out?

1160
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,369
What's the out button?

1161
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:16,369
Dorm room right here.

1162
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:19,460
This is actually pretty cool.

1163
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,460
If you could make something get like in a cool room with your friends hanging out

1164
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,460
You know what my favorite thing about your streams is?

1165
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,460
Is after you play like a shit game for an hour, you always come out with the positives.

1166
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:36,199
How is this a shit game?

1167
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,780
Is Roblox a shit game?

1168
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,840
You don't have to answer that.

1169
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:50,050
I didn't even do this.

1170
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,050
This is why I look like a default character.

1171
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,289
I didn't have any personality for God's sakes.

1172
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:55,289
All right.

1173
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:57,909
Let me just take off my toupee.

1174
00:53:57,909 --> 00:53:58,909
Put it on there.

1175
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:02,710
All right.

1176
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,710
I'm going to open up Survive.

1177
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,710
First I have to like YouTube or funny break something.

1178
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,739
It didn't even work.

1179
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,369
All right.

1180
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:13,369
Time to change games to Survive.

1181
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:16,989
In fact, let me just pull up for a second.

1182
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:22,969
All right.

1183
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,230
There we go.

1184
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,230
So you in Survive right now?

1185
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,230
Yeah.

1186
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:39,050
I'm a furry and I hated that.

1187
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,050
I didn't.

1188
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,050
I just went in.

1189
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,050
I just, it was all right.

1190
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,050
I just put on a spiral dragon caught in uniform.

1191
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:49,380
All right.

1192
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,460
Survive.

1193
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,460
Why is the rec room still open?

1194
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,809
That was weird.

1195
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:04,059
So how self-explanatory is it to get in a room?

1196
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:06,260
I don't know.

1197
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,260
It like starts you in this really weird room.

1198
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,260
I'm going to change my name.

1199
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:16,260
So we're going to, we're doing a, this is a co-op zombie survival game.

1200
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:23,019
It has like an H1Z1 title that I can't even put it into this.

1201
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,019
Yeah.

1202
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:27,059
There we go.

1203
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:31,699
It's H1Z1 with like an extra S and a U.

1204
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:32,699
Oh God.

1205
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:33,699
I'm in.

1206
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:44,619
That was sudden.

1207
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,619
Going back in.

1208
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:51,860
Okay.

1209
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:59,460
I exited rec room and like 300 people came back.

1210
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,460
It's fun.

1211
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,460
Come on.

1212
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,860
It was a fun experience.

1213
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:14,159
Going back in.

1214
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,159
This game just jumps out at you.

1215
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,420
You said?

1216
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,420
It gives you some, you're in a room.

1217
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,420
It gives you some options for like how you want to turn and move.

1218
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,420
I would go through it real quick.

1219
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,420
And as soon as you're done, like throws you to a main menu.

1220
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,050
Okay.

1221
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,050
But I don't see how to join each other.

1222
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,050
So I'm looking around.

1223
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,050
You can figure it out while I stuff my face in here.

1224
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:47,579
Oh, you have to beat the tutorial for co-op.

1225
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:48,579
God damn it.

1226
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:51,579
I got like face grease all over the shit already.

1227
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:52,579
Come on.

1228
00:56:52,579 --> 00:57:06,179
Hold on.

1229
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:07,179
All right.

1230
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,179
It's only been like fucking 30 minutes.

1231
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:10,059
How long has it been?

1232
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,059
Has it been longer than that?

1233
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:16,500
How fucking long have I been screaming?

1234
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,440
Holy shit.

1235
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
It's been more than an hour.

1236
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,440
Never mind.

1237
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,800
That's better.

1238
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,619
All right.

1239
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:30,619
Welcome to survive.

1240
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:37,679
All right.

1241
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,820
For the best play experience you're supposed to answer, how do I walk?

1242
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,820
What the fuck is happening?

1243
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,309
Do I have a glue man shirt on?

1244
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:49,380
For the best play you're supposed to answer a few questions.

1245
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,380
You can freely update all options later as well as play this wizard again.

1246
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,380
The game has many other options.

1247
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,380
You use the sign in main.

1248
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:07,650
Okay.

1249
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,849
Use your finger.

1250
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:12,849
To start tiered with touch here with your finger.

1251
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:16,389
How tall are you?

1252
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:20,389
We've automatically set your height, but this will work only if your VR device is correctly set up.

1253
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:23,389
Feel free to override it manually.

1254
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:39,099
This looks right.

1255
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,099
This looks correct.

1256
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,400
Okay.

1257
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,400
That's good.

1258
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,369
Who are you?

1259
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:46,369
Who did you pick?

1260
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:48,440
Steve.

1261
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,440
Okay.

1262
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,440
You picked Steve.

1263
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,139
I want to be Steve too though.

1264
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:57,630
I'll be Jason.

1265
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,639
Do you want to see your body?

1266
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:03,639
This will not influence how other players will see you.

1267
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:04,639
No.

1268
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:05,639
I like it.

1269
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:06,639
I like seeing me.

1270
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:13,150
I think that's fine.

1271
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,150
How do you like to choose pad and stick?

1272
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,460
What the fuck is going on there?

1273
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,460
Arm swing.

1274
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:28,840
Are they going to do arm swing?

1275
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:39,449
How do you like to turn?

1276
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:42,389
What is HMD?

1277
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:43,389
I have no idea.

1278
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:45,389
I set mine to snap.

1279
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:48,269
Snap turn?

1280
00:59:48,269 --> 00:59:51,269
Yeah, so when you thumb stick it just snaps you.

1281
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:52,269
Guns volume.

1282
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:54,269
I'm going to turn guns volume on normal.

1283
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:56,269
And there's only normal and realistic.

1284
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:57,269
What does that mean?

1285
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:58,269
Is it louder on realistic?

1286
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:00,269
Realistic is very loud.

1287
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,269
Would recommend.

1288
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,269
This is not an arcade game.

1289
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:05,269
You want me to peek my microphone?

1290
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:10,670
Why do you want me to peek my microphone?

1291
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,670
I want you to peek your microphone with realistic guns now.

1292
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,670
No checkpoints for nightmare.

1293
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:15,670
Okay, what are we doing?

1294
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:20,300
Survivor or no future?

1295
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Sissy, can I play daddy?

1296
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,300
How about just survivor?

1297
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,239
Okay.

1298
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:34,130
Story mode starts at chapter zero prologue.

1299
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:41,079
It's a real tutorial.

1300
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,280
Okay, so we just have to...

1301
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,460
Alright, story.

1302
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,460
And then story will give you a tutorial you have to do.

1303
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
And I'll wait for you at the end.

1304
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
Okay.

1305
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:03,789
Can you guys hear this?

1306
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:21,010
Infection day 47, chapter zero prologue tutorial.

1307
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,010
Oh, I walk.

1308
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:28,260
Alright, that didn't seem correct.

1309
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:36,340
Okay, okay.

1310
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,340
Whoa, wait a minute.

1311
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,400
Why is this happening?

1312
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:49,059
Why is it doing this?

1313
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:52,829
Why am I doing this?

1314
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:54,829
Arm swing.

1315
01:01:54,829 --> 01:01:58,119
Stop moving.

1316
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,119
How do I stop?

1317
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:10,820
Okay, there's a zombie right there.

1318
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,820
I hate this.

1319
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,820
I hate this.

1320
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,820
How do I...

1321
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,820
Wait for the button to go to the menu.

1322
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,940
Press trackpad in any direction to sprint.

1323
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,800
Something's not right here.

1324
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,880
Okay.

1325
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,880
Press the grip button to grab it.

1326
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,880
It's just moving me around.

1327
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,849
Okay.

1328
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:58,659
Healing spray is limited so use it carefully.

1329
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:01,030
How do I put it away?

1330
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:05,980
You have bags on your waist.

1331
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:13,630
You can put them in the right one.

1332
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,960
Did it tell you how to do that?

1333
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,329
No.

1334
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:19,329
It tells you later.

1335
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,329
Why?

1336
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,329
What?

1337
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,329
Just go with the tutorial.

1338
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:26,329
Stop strutting out about this apocalypse.

1339
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:30,059
I have to change the controls.

1340
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:31,059
These are terrible.

1341
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:33,369
Why do I think this is a good idea?

1342
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:44,530
Are you lefty?

1343
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:49,530
Press and hold menu button to change trackpad between locomotion or action mode.

1344
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:54,780
Okay, that's better.

1345
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,780
Not really though.

1346
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,659
Freaking arm swing.

1347
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:05,539
Duck to get through.

1348
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:07,539
Center, press left touchpad.

1349
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:11,769
This is so fucked up right now.

1350
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:16,070
Like every time I move any direction.

1351
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:21,139
Press left touchpad playing in seated position.

1352
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:23,139
I'm not in a seated position.

1353
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:26,280
How do I fucking move?

1354
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,280
I should have just done god damn teleport.

1355
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:38,840
Okay, trigger button to grab.

1356
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,659
Oh my god.

1357
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:43,659
Stop moving.

1358
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:48,199
Grab a magazine.

1359
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:52,769
Yeah.

1360
01:04:52,769 --> 01:05:11,349
Don't move.

1361
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:22,869
How do I release this?

1362
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:33,280
How do you get rid of the magazine?

1363
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,900
You press E or one of the buttons on your hand.

1364
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,090
I didn't fucking tell you that.

1365
01:05:41,090 --> 01:06:08,670
Under barrel flashlight, touch under barrel flashlight.

1366
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:14,000
I cannot wait to go to a menu and turn the shit off.

1367
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Even aiming my gun is making me walk.

1368
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:31,550
Yeah.

1369
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:47,429
Alright, not bad.

1370
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:50,800
Press down on the trackpad.

1371
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:59,269
Down.

1372
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:00,269
Probably almost done here.

1373
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:03,019
It's actually a lot longer.

1374
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,019
Is it longer?

1375
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:07,019
Like I don't know when this ends still.

1376
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:09,019
Oh god, you're still in it?

1377
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:10,019
Yeah.

1378
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:14,250
Put objects in your backpack?

1379
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:20,139
No, not yet.

1380
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:21,139
Not yet.

1381
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:24,719
Okay, you just gotta throw it behind you.

1382
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:30,860
Can I have three objects?

1383
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,170
That's in my backpack right now.

1384
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:34,170
It's not.

1385
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:39,289
That's how you know.

1386
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,289
Okay.

1387
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:46,710
Oh man.

1388
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:51,320
No, I'm trying to.

1389
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,070
Fuck.

1390
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,210
How can I tell what's in my backpack?

1391
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:01,199
Can I get in my backpack?

1392
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:03,199
I just took the bullets out.

1393
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:08,880
What was I thinking doing this?

1394
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,880
I have no idea how to get into your backpack.

1395
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,179
Sidearms and weapons and...

1396
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:23,619
What?

1397
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:32,619
Okay, you can keep it in three magazines in your belt.

1398
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:38,340
This guy...

1399
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,899
Did that go in my belt?

1400
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:49,899
I think so, yeah.

1401
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:58,180
I don't know if this is the tutorial or the whole game.

1402
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,180
Didn't it say once we get to the end of the tutorial we can play together?

1403
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,180
I know, but this feels unreasonably long.

1404
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,180
Fight together, that's what it says.

1405
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:19,600
Are you sure?

1406
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,380
Vive inside.

1407
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:28,689
This looks like a safe house.

1408
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,539
Press grip to grab the drill.

1409
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:39,539
Okay.

1410
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,539
What the fuck?

1411
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:54,020
Okay, this has...

1412
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,020
No, this is definitely it.

1413
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,020
Speak, friend, and enter.

1414
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,020
This is it.

1415
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,579
Right?

1416
01:09:58,579 --> 01:09:59,579
It has to be.

1417
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:01,579
Fight together.

1418
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:03,579
How do I invite you?

1419
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,270
I don't know.

1420
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,020
I assumed that was still in the tutorial.

1421
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,020
Is it...

1422
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:15,329
Is it like a start menu?

1423
01:10:15,329 --> 01:10:17,329
No, it is not.

1424
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:20,329
Does anybody know...

1425
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:22,329
how to...

1426
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:25,329
I've got to get back to the controls.

1427
01:10:25,329 --> 01:10:27,329
Anybody have any idea?

1428
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,329
I can't smash the TV.

1429
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,329
Zero out of ten.

1430
01:10:37,329 --> 01:10:39,329
Arms up to enter the menu.

1431
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:41,329
What a lie.

1432
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:43,890
There was a button to skip...

1433
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:49,239
Hey, there's a button to skip the tutorial at the very beginning.

1434
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,239
You want to just reload and press the button?

1435
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,239
I think I'm probably at the end.

1436
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:01,239
You can skip and I can explain anything.

1437
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,239
I don't know how to leave the game though.

1438
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:05,239
It's always Alt-F4, easy.

1439
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:11,239
I have to turn this shit off.

1440
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,479
I'm just fucking going to quit the game.

1441
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:19,479
This actually is a text-to-speech voice.

1442
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:21,479
I'm just going to fucking sprint.

1443
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:22,479
Zen's outside.

1444
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:23,479
Shoot the lock to continue.

1445
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,479
Let's go.

1446
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:25,479
Come on.

1447
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:26,479
Just go.

1448
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:28,479
You can keep two melee on your side.

1449
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:36,859
This seems like fun.

1450
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:37,859
It's a checkpoint.

1451
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:39,859
Oh man, come on.

1452
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:46,779
How do I open the door?

1453
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:47,779
What if I drill?

1454
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:57,739
Open it to unlock a...

1455
01:11:57,739 --> 01:11:58,739
Got it.

1456
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:05,939
It worked.

1457
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:10,890
All right, Cole.

1458
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,890
Do you see how fucking odd this is?

1459
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:13,890
No.

1460
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:29,659
It's so fucking throw-up inducing.

1461
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:44,590
I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.

1462
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:47,789
It's my stupid brain.

1463
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:52,180
I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.

1464
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,180
I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.

1465
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,420
It's my stupid brain that decided to do it.

1466
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,500
What decided to do it?

1467
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,500
I just hit my fucking face on the car door.

1468
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:12,970
What is this?

1469
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,970
What's this like popsicle bag?

1470
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:20,180
Okay.

1471
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,180
I mean, I've gotten to a second safe house now.

1472
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,479
I'm just going to skip the tutorial and see where I am.

1473
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:31,899
Turn the gun on yourself.

1474
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:32,899
Turn the gun on yourself.

1475
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:39,199
Oh, fuck.

1476
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,199
This is a checkpoint.

1477
01:13:41,199 --> 01:14:05,970
I have to complete it.

1478
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,970
I think we have to complete this, dude.

1479
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:10,460
Oh, I just quit.

1480
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,460
Press the...

1481
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:19,229
Can I just like...

1482
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:21,239
Oh, look.

1483
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,239
Star is now playing survive.

1484
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:28,270
You need to run.

1485
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:31,109
All right.

1486
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:32,109
Let's...

1487
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:38,279
Damn it.

1488
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:41,500
I have to like exit.

1489
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Do I actually have to go home?

1490
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,699
He's mad.

1491
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:51,260
Why can't it just be like some kind of start menu?

1492
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:56,319
Don't you have like a...

1493
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,619
VR button to open up that menu and close it?

1494
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:01,800
Where is it?

1495
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,859
Screen savers?

1496
01:15:06,859 --> 01:15:07,859
What?

1497
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:09,859
No, these are Steam friends.

1498
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:10,859
There it is.

1499
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:11,859
Okay, let's go.

1500
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:13,859
Oh, no.

1501
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:16,670
Skip the tutorial.

1502
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:17,670
I can't.

1503
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,670
What do you mean you can't?

1504
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,670
Because I reached checkpoints and it saved my game,

1505
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,670
so it didn't start me at the beginning.

1506
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,550
I clicked story and it just started me back where I was.

1507
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,880
Is it like a new profile?

1508
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,340
But thank God I can at least turn this shit off.

1509
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,689
For the love of God.

1510
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:45,729
Read what that says.

1511
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:48,289
Can anybody fucking read this?

1512
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:53,659
Wait a minute.

1513
01:15:53,659 --> 01:15:55,659
How close am I to something?

1514
01:15:55,659 --> 01:16:05,289
Pad and stick.

1515
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:09,260
Standing...

1516
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:19,300
So you're telling me that we can't...

1517
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,500
Are you sure?

1518
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,579
Players.

1519
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:26,579
Two player.

1520
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:46,979
And teleport.

1521
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:51,850
So are you...

1522
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,850
Do we actually have to do this anyway?

1523
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,880
This is disappointing.

1524
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,880
Wait a minute.

1525
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:08,100
I can skip the tutorial.

1526
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,399
How?

1527
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:10,399
I just had to start...

1528
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:12,399
I just started it over again.

1529
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,399
Never mind.

1530
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:15,829
It's a lie.

1531
01:17:15,829 --> 01:17:20,899
Uh-huh.

1532
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:23,899
Why is this...

1533
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,899
Why is this still doing this?

1534
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:32,899
I did teleport.

1535
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:35,460
I didn't save the settings?

1536
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,460
What?

1537
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,460
I thought I...

1538
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:46,449
Ah!

1539
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:50,439
Are you sure?

1540
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:53,439
I thought I hit save settings like twice.

1541
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:56,770
Oh fucking God.

1542
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:04,119
Give me a break.

1543
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:07,579
Are you sure I didn't hit save settings?

1544
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:25,520
Hello?

1545
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:41,899
Just add a start menu.

1546
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:46,850
Like hold this button down for like three seconds for something.

1547
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,090
That's like, come on.

1548
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:52,539
What the heck?

1549
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:54,539
Do I have to quit the game to go to the menu?

1550
01:18:54,539 --> 01:19:02,439
Or am I insane?

1551
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:15,220
I can save settings.

1552
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,220
Two player co-op.

1553
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:27,529
Teleport.

1554
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,529
Are you still in the room with me?

1555
01:19:29,529 --> 01:19:31,409
What?

1556
01:19:31,409 --> 01:19:33,409
There is a start menu.

1557
01:19:33,409 --> 01:19:34,409
How did I get to it?

1558
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:52,340
So apparently we hit a tablet at the end of the tutorial to like have a menu.

1559
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,340
Are you still doing the tutorial?

1560
01:19:54,340 --> 01:20:00,479
I can't figure out anything else to do so I'm doing it.

1561
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:02,909
I'm just running through.

1562
01:20:02,909 --> 01:20:16,369
If only we knew we should just press the fucking goddamn big red button.

1563
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:22,369
I don't know what's going to be in the story when the tutorial is showing you every feature in the game.

1564
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:23,369
God fucking damn it.

1565
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:28,989
I'm going to scream.

1566
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:32,739
How am I supposed to reliably just teleport?

1567
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:44,829
And this is even worse.

1568
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:59,470
Where did my gun go?

1569
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:01,470
I get that.

1570
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:07,779
I guess I'm full over here.

1571
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:17,710
I don't have a gun to shoot this.

1572
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:18,710
Do I have a gun?

1573
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:22,079
Where's my gun?

1574
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:38,430
I can't go through there without a gun.

1575
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:47,829
Get me out of this fucking room.

1576
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:50,520
Why didn't I...

1577
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,520
I went down here.

1578
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:58,880
Oh my god.

1579
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,880
Get me the fuck out of here.

1580
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:07,939
You don't seem too good.

1581
01:22:07,939 --> 01:22:16,640
Oh my god.

1582
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,119
Okay, just give me an axe.

1583
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:22,119
I'm fucking going as fast as I can.

1584
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:27,939
Is there anything over here?

1585
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:33,770
Do I not hold this with two hands?

1586
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:55,619
Hey, I made it.

1587
01:22:55,619 --> 01:23:04,640
Does it matter which way I go here?

1588
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:13,390
Probably not.

1589
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,390
It's fun.

1590
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:26,090
It's not a sidearm.

1591
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:37,739
Okay, alright.

1592
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:39,739
You'll be done in about an hour.

1593
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:41,739
No.

1594
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:44,899
I'm still going.

1595
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:46,899
Are you still in the story?

1596
01:23:46,899 --> 01:23:47,899
Yeah.

1597
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:51,989
Why didn't we just press the button?

1598
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:54,989
I'm hoping that when I get to the end I can end what you were saying.

1599
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:55,989
I hope so.

1600
01:23:55,989 --> 01:24:11,859
What's going on here?

1601
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,770
This guy's as a zombie.

1602
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:19,069
You can like dump goo all over yourself.

1603
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:27,100
Grab the stew, okay?

1604
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,100
Zombies do not attack you, but stay away from them.

1605
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,100
Don't use any gun or object.

1606
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,100
Be quiet.

1607
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:38,329
Press C.

1608
01:24:38,329 --> 01:24:40,270
Ah!

1609
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,270
I pressed it!

1610
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:42,270
I pressed the button!

1611
01:24:42,270 --> 01:25:13,659
I think that skipped the tutorial.

1612
01:25:13,659 --> 01:25:23,680
I need that flashlight.

1613
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,680
Where's the flashlight?

1614
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,500
I had one before.

1615
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,500
If only we just pressed the fucking red button.

1616
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,699
I think I'm at the end.

1617
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:34,699
Oh, thank God.

1618
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:35,699
Please invite me.

1619
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:37,699
Get me out of this hell.

1620
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:45,029
I've got tablets and walkie talkies.

1621
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:46,029
Please.

1622
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:48,029
Roger that.

1623
01:25:48,029 --> 01:25:58,909
Is this how I'm supposed to open this door?

1624
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:07,279
I did it!

1625
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:13,579
Oh no.

1626
01:26:13,579 --> 01:26:15,899
Why are you oh noing?

1627
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:16,899
Don't oh no right now.

1628
01:26:16,899 --> 01:26:17,899
That's not what we need.

1629
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:19,899
We don't need an oh no.

1630
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:22,210
We need like an oh yes.

1631
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:26,500
I think this is part two of the tutorial.

1632
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,500
No, it's not.

1633
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,890
I mean, it still said chapter zero.

1634
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,409
I couldn't open that before.

1635
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:35,409
Why?

1636
01:26:35,409 --> 01:26:39,619
Honest to God, what is going on?

1637
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:40,619
It's teleport.

1638
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:46,689
I'm like, I have like a whip in my hand.

1639
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:54,180
I can't go further?

1640
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,319
A water bender over here.

1641
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,319
Okay.

1642
01:26:58,319 --> 01:26:59,319
Figure it out.

1643
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:00,319
No.

1644
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:01,319
What is in my backpack right now?

1645
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:33,199
The spray is really loud.

1646
01:27:33,199 --> 01:28:08,859
The hold a button.

1647
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:12,859
So I have, I don't want this shit in there.

1648
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:13,859
Get that out of here.

1649
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:14,859
Give me this.

1650
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:27,619
I don't care.

1651
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:28,619
Let's just go.

1652
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:30,619
We need to get to the, so we can play.

1653
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:37,939
The whole point is this is a co-op video game to play together.

1654
01:28:37,939 --> 01:28:39,939
So you're not out of the tutorial.

1655
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:45,930
I'm, I think I'm getting the tutorial to when the game isn't a tutorial.

1656
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:55,060
They gave me the tablet and it has like find a game on it, but it's grayed out.

1657
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,060
I don't know how I would invite you.

1658
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:05,619
At this point, it would probably actually be faster if we like uninstalled the game and then reinstalled the game and then skip the story.

1659
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:10,619
Oh, all I know is I'm, I'm feeling sick like having to walk here.

1660
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:13,619
No, no.

1661
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:22,449
That didn't go in my holster.

1662
01:29:22,449 --> 01:29:24,449
This is a, this is a monster in here.

1663
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:26,449
I need to drill.

1664
01:29:26,449 --> 01:29:32,029
Do a drill.

1665
01:29:32,029 --> 01:29:34,460
Is there a gun in here?

1666
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,109
I can't open that.

1667
01:29:37,109 --> 01:29:56,100
Oh, this is cool.

1668
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,100
Go in here.

1669
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:11,159
Why do I have one of these?

1670
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:13,170
Okay.

1671
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:17,420
Give me the, give me this.

1672
01:30:17,420 --> 01:31:19,300
I'm turning into the zombie.

1673
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,340
Is something going on here?

1674
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,340
Where am I in my room?

1675
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:27,340
Am I like, did I like punch a hole in the wall?

1676
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,640
Why?

1677
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,840
Change fire mode.

1678
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,659
He just won't stop talking and telling me what to do.

1679
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:40,340
But he won't tell me what I really want to know, which is how to be friends.

1680
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:48,539
What is going on right now?

1681
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:54,810
That's bad.

1682
01:31:54,810 --> 01:32:01,760
This is like good game mechanics too.

1683
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:08,289
Like losing the track on the ground.

1684
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:12,229
Three magazines in your belt pouches.

1685
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:14,229
So you get the front pouches.

1686
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:35,619
So what do you want to do about this?

1687
01:32:35,619 --> 01:32:37,619
One of the other games we have.

1688
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:42,619
Do you want to keep playing in a tutorial until we can play with each other?

1689
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:48,729
What is that sound?

1690
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:51,729
Why is there somebody washing dishes?

1691
01:32:51,729 --> 01:33:01,350
I'm going to throw up.

1692
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:04,739
Ah, shit.

1693
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:08,819
Somebody hit the zombie with a shopping cart?

1694
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:09,819
Oh, okay.

1695
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:19,270
What are you doing?

1696
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:31,649
God damn it.

1697
01:33:31,649 --> 01:33:35,649
Alright, it might be time to make an executive decision and do something else.

1698
01:33:35,649 --> 01:33:37,909
Bye.

1699
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:39,149
One second.

1700
01:33:39,149 --> 01:33:45,460
If this is not the end of the tutorial.

1701
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,460
Chapter one!

1702
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,279
I'm so far behind you though.

1703
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:50,279
Tell me, like guide me.

1704
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:51,279
Okay, I just got to be so far.

1705
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:53,279
I'll just see if I can invite you.

1706
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,279
Trust me, you're not going to catch up anytime soon.

1707
01:33:56,279 --> 01:34:07,539
I'm trying to go as fast as I can.

1708
01:34:07,539 --> 01:34:08,909
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

1709
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:11,909
What? Is that you?

1710
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:14,979
This is an all frequency message.

1711
01:34:14,979 --> 01:34:15,979
Are you contacting me?

1712
01:34:15,979 --> 01:34:16,979
My name is Jeremy Stan.

1713
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:18,979
Are you writing this?

1714
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:21,420
You're almost at the end.

1715
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,420
You need to beat this.

1716
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:27,420
This is the only way you get the join session on your story mode.

1717
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,420
I'm limited by the teleport.

1718
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:32,420
If you want to keep going, I'm sitting on the ground and I'm going to wait for you.

1719
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,420
Okay, I'm going.

1720
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,420
I'm going.

1721
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,420
I'm going.

1722
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:41,500
So you tell me I just got the assault rifle?

1723
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:54,289
You have to kill like a giant group of things and you might get past this military base and you're done.

1724
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:58,829
Did I walk by something?

1725
01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:08,579
Yeah.

1726
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:14,699
Someone in President's sleep was in chat.

1727
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:16,699
I'm sorry.

1728
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:18,699
We didn't know this was going to happen.

1729
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:19,699
Just wake up.

1730
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:23,779
Just wait until we play Desert Bus.

1731
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:29,079
Save your resident sleepers for Desert Bus.

1732
01:35:29,079 --> 01:35:34,520
Okay, I made it through another room.

1733
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,520
Is it a drill?

1734
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,819
Skip that room.

1735
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:39,819
Skip this room.

1736
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:41,819
It's like a safe house, right?

1737
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:42,819
Is it?

1738
01:35:42,819 --> 01:35:43,819
I don't know.

1739
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:47,090
Is this like the army wants you or something?

1740
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:49,520
You want the army guy.

1741
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:58,369
Are you sure I don't go in this house with a big red door?

1742
01:35:58,369 --> 01:36:06,199
I guess.

1743
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:10,659
No.

1744
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:30,510
I need a drill.

1745
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:36,590
I got the radio.

1746
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:41,949
Hello.

1747
01:36:41,949 --> 01:36:44,949
Okay, you just have to follow the instructions.

1748
01:36:44,949 --> 01:36:46,949
Don't get distracted.

1749
01:36:46,949 --> 01:36:49,949
And as soon as you finish everything.

1750
01:36:49,949 --> 01:36:51,949
What do you mean as soon as I finish everything?

1751
01:36:51,949 --> 01:36:55,949
You go into a whole other room with a bunch of guns and he gives you like tutorial number two.

1752
01:36:55,949 --> 01:36:57,949
I thought you said I was done.

1753
01:36:57,949 --> 01:36:58,949
And then you're done.

1754
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:00,949
I thought you said I was done.

1755
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:02,949
Just follow instructions.

1756
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,140
And then we could play for like 10 minutes.

1757
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:15,500
Mom's calling me for supper.

1758
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,500
Put the radio on the left shoulder of your backpack.

1759
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:36,970
It's right there.

1760
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:38,970
It's right there.

1761
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:41,659
Put it on your back.

1762
01:37:41,659 --> 01:37:42,659
Wait, what?

1763
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:48,659
What is I'm going to put this like fucking scholastic tablet in my pants on your butt?

1764
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:24,300
Thank you.

1765
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:31,649
Weapons.

1766
01:38:32,649 --> 01:38:37,550
I got something to say.

1767
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:43,550
Why not just have this room have all the like tutorials in it?

1768
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,550
And it's like you can play around.

1769
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,550
Make sure you figure out how you understand how the game works.

1770
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,550
I don't know, man.

1771
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:51,300
Because this is tutorial room two.

1772
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,300
Why don't I have like a bigger tutorial room zero here?

1773
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,630
I don't know, man.

1774
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:16,920
You lied to me.

1775
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,920
You said I was done.

1776
01:39:30,739 --> 01:39:34,739
I'm begging you to play something else.

1777
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:37,960
No, guys.

1778
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:38,960
Give it a chance.

1779
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:39,960
Just wait.

1780
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:40,960
Just give it a chance.

1781
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,779
We've put in so much time.

1782
01:39:42,779 --> 01:39:44,779
We're almost there.

1783
01:39:44,779 --> 01:39:49,729
Got it.

1784
01:39:49,729 --> 01:40:03,939
Do you know how to do it now?

1785
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:04,939
I can't.

1786
01:40:04,939 --> 01:40:05,939
It's fine.

1787
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:10,989
You should be able to carry also smaller ones.

1788
01:40:10,989 --> 01:40:15,470
Didn't we already do this?

1789
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:18,470
This feels like what should have been the tutorial.

1790
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:19,470
I'm confused.

1791
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:33,420
Testfully complete course to become a thought-becoming mother figure.

1792
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:44,119
407 days later, that's what it feels like.

1793
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:45,119
Yeah.

1794
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,340
Chapter one.

1795
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,340
Bad Satan.

1796
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,340
There you go.

1797
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,340
Can we do it?

1798
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:58,739
On your tablet, you should have a find a game.

1799
01:40:58,739 --> 01:40:59,920
Find a game.

1800
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,310
Search for an available session or join a random session.

1801
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:05,310
Refresh.

1802
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:13,399
Got it.

1803
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:31,279
You did it.

1804
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:33,420
Just wait.

1805
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,420
Don't say that yet.

1806
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,420
Don't say that.

1807
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,420
Instead of new players, join the game.

1808
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,720
All right.

1809
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,880
Now, how do I change my controls again?

1810
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,720
Oh, I can hear you in game.

1811
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,720
Don't move.

1812
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:48,720
Don't move.

1813
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,340
No.

1814
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,340
Don't move.

1815
01:41:51,340 --> 01:42:02,569
Don't move.

1816
01:42:02,569 --> 01:42:03,569
Trust me.

1817
01:42:03,569 --> 01:42:04,569
That's fucking terrifying.

1818
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:11,119
Wow.

1819
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:14,060
Do you want to come join me?

1820
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,060
Yeah.

1821
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,060
Is there?

1822
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,619
Can I?

1823
01:42:17,619 --> 01:42:23,279
All right.

1824
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:24,279
Wait, wait, wait.

1825
01:42:24,279 --> 01:42:25,279
You ready to go kill some zombies?

1826
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:26,279
Not yet.

1827
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:27,279
Stay there.

1828
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:28,279
You left.

1829
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:29,279
Just wait.

1830
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:30,279
I have to change.

1831
01:42:30,279 --> 01:42:32,279
The teleports make me sick too.

1832
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:35,779
We're almost there.

1833
01:42:35,779 --> 01:42:36,779
Just another minute.

1834
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:37,779
Just everybody relax.

1835
01:42:37,779 --> 01:42:38,779
Calm down.

1836
01:42:38,779 --> 01:42:39,779
You've been very patient.

1837
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:45,539
And I appreciate the fact that probably only 600 or 700 people left.

1838
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:46,539
Okay.

1839
01:42:46,539 --> 01:42:52,100
I'm doing movement type pad and stick.

1840
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,100
Is that what you have?

1841
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,100
I don't remember.

1842
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,100
Did you pad and stick?

1843
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,539
I think so.

1844
01:43:01,539 --> 01:43:08,340
All right.

1845
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,340
Story.

1846
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:13,850
Okay.

1847
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:14,850
Let's go.

1848
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:15,850
Let's go.

1849
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:16,850
Let's do it.

1850
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:17,850
Let's do it.

1851
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:18,850
Come on.

1852
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:19,850
Come on.

1853
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:20,850
Come on.

1854
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:21,850
Come on.

1855
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:22,850
Get fucking calm down about this.

1856
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:26,579
Turn the audio down.

1857
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:27,579
You got it.

1858
01:43:27,579 --> 01:43:30,939
Okay.

1859
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:43,680
All right.

1860
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,680
Invite me again.

1861
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,680
No, don't invite me.

1862
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:46,680
I got you.

1863
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:58,100
I can't see the viewer count.

1864
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,100
How many people are here?

1865
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,460
I can't see.

1866
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:01,460
Like 15.

1867
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:04,460
Did everybody fucking leave?

1868
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:11,020
Just about to get crunked.

1869
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:14,020
I am so sorry, guys.

1870
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:15,020
I'm so sorry.

1871
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,020
That took way too long.

1872
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,020
This game is going to be fun.

1873
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,500
We'll make it up for you in Desert Bus.

1874
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:25,500
We're going to make it up to you guys when we play Desert Bus.

1875
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,529
Welcome to VR.

1876
01:44:28,529 --> 01:44:29,529
That's right.

1877
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,529
I'm talking to you.

1878
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:31,529
I know where I am.

1879
01:44:31,529 --> 01:44:32,529
There you are.

1880
01:44:32,529 --> 01:44:45,100
There you are.

1881
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,100
There he is.

1882
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,100
It's me.

1883
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,100
Hey, turn around.

1884
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:49,909
Look at me.

1885
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:50,909
What are you doing?

1886
01:44:50,909 --> 01:44:52,539
Let me just do this.

1887
01:44:52,539 --> 01:44:53,539
What are you doing?

1888
01:44:53,539 --> 01:45:02,819
What are you talking about?

1889
01:45:02,819 --> 01:45:03,819
Okay, get the fuck off me.

1890
01:45:03,819 --> 01:45:04,819
Get the fuck off.

1891
01:45:04,819 --> 01:45:10,289
Get the fuck away from me.

1892
01:45:10,289 --> 01:45:11,289
Get away from me.

1893
01:45:11,289 --> 01:45:12,289
Get the fuck out of here.

1894
01:45:12,289 --> 01:45:17,109
I ain't going to fucking have that happen.

1895
01:45:17,109 --> 01:45:31,489
I'm ready to fight the zombies.

1896
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:34,109
What happened?

1897
01:45:34,109 --> 01:45:35,109
How did I make a pretzel?

1898
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:36,109
What is this?

1899
01:45:36,109 --> 01:45:37,109
What am I holding?

1900
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:38,109
What am I holding?

1901
01:45:38,109 --> 01:45:41,819
What am I holding?

1902
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:44,470
What?

1903
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:55,380
I don't understand how this happened.

1904
01:45:55,380 --> 01:46:02,779
I can't do it.

1905
01:46:02,779 --> 01:46:09,539
On my screen, it's some sort of interpretive dance.

1906
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:10,539
Just wait for Desert Bus.

1907
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:20,729
You guys are going to be fucking lit up for it.

1908
01:46:20,729 --> 01:46:21,729
Oh shit.

1909
01:46:21,729 --> 01:46:22,729
Did I rip it out?

1910
01:46:22,729 --> 01:46:24,029
No, I'm good.

1911
01:46:24,029 --> 01:46:35,189
Okay, that was fucking out of control.

1912
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:43,170
Alright, let's play this goddamn game.

1913
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,170
Stop!

1914
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:45,170
Stop, you dick.

1915
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:46,170
What?

1916
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,170
You're going to kill me.

1917
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,170
It's killing me.

1918
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:55,170
Do you understand?

1919
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,170
Wish I could be so lucky.

1920
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:11,960
Am I going to revive?

1921
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:22,430
Oh no, did it boot us?

1922
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:25,310
I think it booted us.

1923
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:26,310
I'm here.

1924
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,310
Okay.

1925
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:28,310
I'm right here.

1926
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:29,310
Are you sure?

1927
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:32,600
Yeah.

1928
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,600
Alright.

1929
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,529
We took so long to get here.

1930
01:47:37,529 --> 01:47:46,170
Give me one of these.

1931
01:47:46,170 --> 01:48:05,100
What are you doing?

1932
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,909
What are you doing?

1933
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:10,430
Stop.

1934
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:11,430
Stop.

1935
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,430
Alright.

1936
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:14,430
No!

1937
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:15,430
I need to live!

1938
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:17,380
Kids!

1939
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:24,460
I can't, we have to...

1940
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,630
It's not...

1941
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:30,699
You know this is going to be better than the game.

1942
01:48:30,699 --> 01:48:31,699
Is it though?

1943
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:32,699
Are you sure about that?

1944
01:48:32,699 --> 01:48:34,010
Positive.

1945
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:35,010
Alright.

1946
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,380
Where are you?

1947
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,220
Soldier.

1948
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,220
Why do you have to keep sitting on the ground?

1949
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:46,539
Because otherwise I'm like up here.

1950
01:48:46,539 --> 01:48:51,579
You're like eight frames a second by the way.

1951
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:54,579
The game is not like, you are not supposed to be here.

1952
01:48:54,579 --> 01:48:59,819
This is going to be very odd.

1953
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:00,819
That's so fucked up.

1954
01:49:00,819 --> 01:49:02,819
That's not normal.

1955
01:49:03,819 --> 01:49:06,000
Alright, soldier.

1956
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Is it fucking huge?

1957
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,100
You don't have to look, just cock it.

1958
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:14,420
It's already got bolts in it.

1959
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:15,420
You put that in your ear.

1960
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:17,420
You put that inside of your...

1961
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,420
You're storing that like a hamster.

1962
01:49:22,779 --> 01:49:25,300
Come on.

1963
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,300
You think you can shoot me?

1964
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,300
Is that what you think?

1965
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:39,989
Alright, your turn.

1966
01:49:39,989 --> 01:49:41,989
Let me see if I can shoot you.

1967
01:49:41,989 --> 01:49:46,180
Okay.

1968
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:47,180
Which way is the right way?

1969
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:54,109
Are we ever going to know what happens to Santa?

1970
01:49:54,109 --> 01:49:55,539
No.

1971
01:49:55,539 --> 01:49:56,539
Oh, you wrecked my face.

1972
01:49:56,539 --> 01:49:59,420
Alright, is there a sniper rifle?

1973
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,420
Yeah, over here.

1974
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,069
This is so awkward.

1975
01:50:05,069 --> 01:50:08,380
Alright, so I want a scope on this.

1976
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,380
This might be the scope.

1977
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:14,380
No, it's right over here.

1978
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:20,510
Is this the scope?

1979
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:21,510
Oh, yeah.

1980
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:23,510
Oh, there we go.

1981
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:27,029
That's not working.

1982
01:50:27,029 --> 01:50:28,029
Catch it, catch it, catch it.

1983
01:50:28,029 --> 01:50:30,029
That's not working, you claymation motherfucker.

1984
01:50:30,029 --> 01:50:35,149
How does this go on?

1985
01:50:38,289 --> 01:50:40,289
How do you put on scopes?

1986
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:52,770
I didn't even get a chance to dodge.

1987
01:50:52,770 --> 01:51:00,470
You holding the scope in one hand?

1988
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:04,760
You're a genius.

1989
01:51:06,189 --> 01:51:08,189
This got so much more fun.

1990
01:51:08,189 --> 01:51:09,189
This is Groundhog Day.

1991
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:11,189
It really is, but it doesn't matter.

1992
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:13,189
We'll get it out of our system in 20 minutes.

1993
01:51:13,189 --> 01:51:17,859
Alright, let's...

1994
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:24,439
No, get away from me.

1995
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:29,560
One in each ear.

1996
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:35,130
Oh, my hand.

1997
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:47,630
Day 407.

1998
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,630
Alright, we've got to stop.

1999
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:52,770
I think grenades in this game.

2000
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:55,390
I hope so.

2001
01:51:55,390 --> 01:52:00,180
Fucking ridiculous.

2002
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:06,229
Find a grenade so we can play with one.

2003
01:52:06,229 --> 01:52:18,569
What's over here?

2004
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:19,569
That's not a grenade.

2005
01:52:19,569 --> 01:52:24,789
Go look under there for a grenade.

2006
01:52:24,789 --> 01:52:35,260
No friendly fire with melee, apparently.

2007
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:41,579
Alright, okay.

2008
01:52:41,579 --> 01:52:42,579
We're done.

2009
01:52:42,579 --> 01:52:52,590
Drop it.

2010
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:58,380
Drop it.

2011
01:52:58,380 --> 01:52:59,380
Right now.

2012
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:00,550
I'm shooting you.

2013
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:01,550
You won't.

2014
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:03,239
Oh, yeah, hey.

2015
01:53:03,239 --> 01:53:04,239
What's up?

2016
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:05,239
What's up, right, man?

2017
01:53:05,239 --> 01:53:06,239
Huh?

2018
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:07,239
No, no, hold your hand up.

2019
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:09,060
What are you doing?

2020
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,060
See?

2021
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:12,060
No, I did the fucking movie thing with the guy with the action leg.

2022
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,060
Hey, man.

2023
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:16,510
Hey, man.

2024
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,510
Hey, man, hey, man.

2025
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,510
No, hey, no.

2026
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:19,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2027
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:21,069
Hey.

2028
01:53:21,069 --> 01:53:23,270
Hey, man.

2029
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:24,640
Hey, man.

2030
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:27,029
Come on.

2031
01:53:27,029 --> 01:53:28,029
One in the chamber.

2032
01:53:28,029 --> 01:53:33,560
Okay, 4-0-7.

2033
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:37,850
I am so caught up in this.

2034
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:40,850
It's not even funny.

2035
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:42,850
This is the game.

2036
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:44,850
We have to, okay, it's time to play the game for real.

2037
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:45,850
You have to leave.

2038
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:47,850
I'm not going, I'm going to wait until you leave the room.

2039
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:50,600
Okay, well, we've got to get equipped.

2040
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,600
I'm going to get equipped.

2041
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,600
Okay, you've got to, wait.

2042
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,600
What's your loadout?

2043
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,600
I've got to tell you, my favorite gun is, okay?

2044
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,600
Okay.

2045
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,600
My favorite, what do you think it is?

2046
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:01,310
Nope, wrong, idiot.

2047
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:06,260
I thought we just talked about how we were going to play the game, and now I'm like

2048
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:09,800
injured.

2049
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:10,800
I'm dead.

2050
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,010
Stop.

2051
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:21,899
I'm going to shoot you.

2052
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:23,140
Oh, yeah?

2053
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:26,659
Is that what you're going to do?

2054
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:27,659
Hey, man.

2055
01:54:27,659 --> 01:54:34,659
Hey, man.

2056
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:49,399
Hey.

2057
01:54:49,399 --> 01:54:52,960
All right, don't even tell, okay, let me tell you something, guys.

2058
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,329
Like, it did, 407 days, okay?

2059
01:54:57,329 --> 01:55:04,140
If this is the 407th time you've revived here, at some point, you're going to Bill

2060
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:07,619
Murray.

2061
01:55:07,619 --> 01:55:09,619
Don't you do it now.

2062
01:55:09,619 --> 01:55:12,949
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2063
01:55:12,949 --> 01:55:16,659
Quick before, shit.

2064
01:55:16,659 --> 01:55:20,250
Hold on, wait, wait.

2065
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,250
Can you shoot through you into me?

2066
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:27,619
Is it possible that you can, like, blow a hole through you and me?

2067
01:55:27,619 --> 01:55:30,619
Try to shoot yourself in the face.

2068
01:55:30,619 --> 01:55:36,359
How do you always like that?

2069
01:55:36,359 --> 01:55:40,300
Can you, okay, wait, can you, like, outstretch your hand?

2070
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:43,500
I don't know what's going on with your head.

2071
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,869
No, you just shot me.

2072
01:55:45,869 --> 01:55:47,869
I need a hand gun.

2073
01:55:47,869 --> 01:55:50,239
Wait, I'm smaller than you.

2074
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:52,060
Hold on.

2075
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:57,369
I am much smaller than you.

2076
01:55:57,369 --> 01:55:58,369
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2077
01:55:58,369 --> 01:55:59,369
Stay there.

2078
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,369
No, no, no.

2079
01:56:00,369 --> 01:56:01,369
I'm going to die.

2080
01:56:01,369 --> 01:56:02,369
Just wait.

2081
01:56:02,369 --> 01:56:04,609
Okay, you have to guide me, okay?

2082
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:05,609
I have to what?

2083
01:56:05,609 --> 01:56:08,170
You have to guide me.

2084
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:09,170
I'll just get behind you.

2085
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,170
I'll line it up.

2086
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:12,340
Okay, line it up.

2087
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,340
Okay.

2088
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,340
Yeah, yeah, that's on me.

2089
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,340
It's on you?

2090
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,340
Yeah.

2091
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:24,710
Didn't get me.

2092
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:28,710
One of us has to fucking call this quits right now, otherwise we'll never leave.

2093
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:40,079
I'm having a great time.

2094
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:41,079
Never leave.

2095
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:43,079
Just stay in here.

2096
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:45,079
Hey, truce.

2097
01:56:45,079 --> 01:56:47,380
It is time for a truce.

2098
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:48,380
Actual truce.

2099
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:49,380
Double high five for a truce.

2100
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,380
Double high five.

2101
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,329
Oh, that was terrible.

2102
01:56:53,329 --> 01:56:57,949
Okay, I actually, like, what are you doing?

2103
01:56:57,949 --> 01:56:58,949
Stop.

2104
01:56:58,949 --> 01:56:59,949
This is supposed to be...

2105
01:56:59,949 --> 01:57:02,600
Yeah, hit me.

2106
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:08,770
Oh, yeah?

2107
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:17,149
What am I doing?

2108
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:23,380
It's his fault.

2109
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:27,670
He keeps doing it every time.

2110
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:28,670
I'm the bigger man here.

2111
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:29,670
No, you got to...

2112
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,670
Literally.

2113
01:57:30,670 --> 01:57:31,670
Literally.

2114
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,100
I'm not leaving.

2115
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:34,100
No, I am leaving right now.

2116
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:38,850
Fine.

2117
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:39,850
Ow.

2118
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:42,050
Okay.

2119
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:43,050
Stock up.

2120
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:44,050
What's...

2121
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:45,050
Okay.

2122
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:46,050
Like I was saying before, what is my favorite gun?

2123
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:47,050
You have to find it.

2124
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:50,539
If you can find my favorite gun, then nice.

2125
01:57:50,539 --> 01:57:59,460
That's a bad gash on you.

2126
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,460
You fucking idiot.

2127
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:07,970
You ran out of time.

2128
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:10,460
That's all right.

2129
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:11,460
It's this one.

2130
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,899
The default handgun.

2131
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:13,899
Don't make me look like an idiot.

2132
01:58:13,899 --> 01:58:14,899
It's...

2133
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:15,899
Where's the deagle?

2134
01:58:15,899 --> 01:58:16,899
This is a deagle, right?

2135
01:58:16,899 --> 01:58:17,899
Yeah, that's a deagle.

2136
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:18,899
Is this a deagle, Chet?

2137
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:19,899
Which one of these is the deagle?

2138
01:58:19,899 --> 01:58:23,180
The bigger one.

2139
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,180
This is the big one.

2140
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,180
Will you get away from me?

2141
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,899
Okay.

2142
01:58:27,899 --> 01:58:31,310
That...

2143
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:32,310
This is the one I like the most.

2144
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:33,310
I like to do the dual...

2145
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:39,609
What's his name?

2146
01:58:39,609 --> 01:58:40,609
Deadpool?

2147
01:58:40,609 --> 01:58:49,020
What is it?

2148
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:52,239
Does Deadpool have two handguns like this?

2149
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:53,239
Do you know?

2150
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:54,739
Come on!

2151
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:58,739
Can you just get some guns and slide them to the door?

2152
01:58:58,739 --> 01:59:06,899
Just get a few guns and slide them to the door.

2153
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:09,100
I don't care what they are.

2154
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,100
Look, I'm just going to take...

2155
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:22,739
Whoa.

2156
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:23,739
Okay.

2157
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:24,739
No, no, no, no.

2158
01:59:24,739 --> 01:59:27,739
Just because I did it to you doesn't mean you should do it to me.

2159
01:59:27,739 --> 01:59:29,739
Oh.

2160
01:59:29,739 --> 01:59:30,739
Oh.

2161
01:59:30,739 --> 01:59:31,739
Oh.

2162
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:32,739
Oh.

2163
01:59:32,739 --> 01:59:33,739
Oh.

2164
01:59:33,739 --> 01:59:34,739
Oh.

2165
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:37,970
Oh.

2166
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:38,970
Oh.

2167
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:51,220
Oh.

2168
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:53,609
Oh.

2169
01:59:53,609 --> 01:59:54,609
Oh.

2170
01:59:54,609 --> 01:59:55,609
Oh.

2171
01:59:55,609 --> 01:59:56,609
Oh.

2172
01:59:56,609 --> 01:59:57,609
You didn't do it to me.

2173
01:59:57,609 --> 01:59:58,609
Oh.

2174
01:59:58,609 --> 02:00:04,600
I'm going to quit the game.

2175
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,899
I was getting ready.

2176
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:07,899
Oh, yeah.

2177
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:10,899
You were doing the crab shotgun walk.

2178
02:00:10,899 --> 02:00:13,899
No, the one before that when you shot me in the head twice.

2179
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:18,189
Yeah, but I couldn't help it.

2180
02:00:18,189 --> 02:00:19,189
That's a shit excuse.

2181
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:20,189
No, okay.

2182
02:00:20,189 --> 02:00:22,369
I'm getting ready.

2183
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:23,930
Okay?

2184
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:27,939
We're going to go shoot zombies.

2185
02:00:27,939 --> 02:00:31,739
Don't even look at each other.

2186
02:00:31,739 --> 02:00:32,739
Don't look at me.

2187
02:00:32,739 --> 02:00:44,020
I like that.

2188
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:56,140
I'm sorry.

2189
02:00:56,140 --> 02:01:06,789
I'm sorry.

2190
02:01:06,789 --> 02:01:08,479
Get first aid.

2191
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:18,810
First aid is over here.

2192
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:19,810
You didn't take that, by the way.

2193
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:25,779
Okay.

2194
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:26,779
You didn't take any of those.

2195
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:27,779
I just want to make sure you're aware of that.

2196
02:01:27,779 --> 02:01:29,779
You did not pick up one of those.

2197
02:01:29,779 --> 02:01:31,090
I did.

2198
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:32,090
No, you didn't.

2199
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:33,090
I heard the zip.

2200
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:34,260
Why?

2201
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:35,260
They're all on the ground.

2202
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:39,079
Hey, open your eyes for a second.

2203
02:01:39,079 --> 02:01:43,199
This is the second time you've done this.

2204
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,460
Yeah.

2205
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,460
You got it.

2206
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,460
Okay, let's go.

2207
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,460
Time to go.

2208
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:49,460
Out that door right now.

2209
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,460
I don't care if you're ready.

2210
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:51,460
Go.

2211
02:01:51,460 --> 02:02:18,430
I don't have a handgun.

2212
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:23,960
After you.

2213
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,960
I'll get the fucking door.

2214
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,949
Wait.

2215
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:29,949
Flashlight.

2216
02:02:29,949 --> 02:02:31,640
Give me the flashlight.

2217
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:34,029
Wait.

2218
02:02:34,029 --> 02:02:35,029
I need a flashlight.

2219
02:02:35,029 --> 02:02:36,029
Don't move.

2220
02:02:36,029 --> 02:02:42,199
I need an attachment.

2221
02:02:42,199 --> 02:02:43,199
No.

2222
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,199
Who cares?

2223
02:02:44,199 --> 02:02:45,199
I'm going.

2224
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:46,199
I got a regular flashlight.

2225
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:47,199
Oh, wait.

2226
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:48,949
Yeah.

2227
02:02:48,949 --> 02:02:49,949
Where's the attachment?

2228
02:02:49,949 --> 02:02:53,819
Oh, that sucks.

2229
02:02:53,819 --> 02:02:54,819
I'm not doing that again.

2230
02:02:54,819 --> 02:02:55,819
That's sticky keys?

2231
02:02:55,819 --> 02:02:58,909
Here they are.

2232
02:02:58,909 --> 02:02:59,909
All right.

2233
02:02:59,909 --> 02:03:03,899
Where?

2234
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:08,470
Chapter one.

2235
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,470
How do you attach this shit?

2236
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:16,979
Who's saying uh-uh?

2237
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:17,979
Yes.

2238
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:22,489
Yes.

2239
02:03:22,489 --> 02:03:23,489
That has to be done.

2240
02:03:23,489 --> 02:03:29,720
How?

2241
02:03:31,470 --> 02:03:33,479
Just go.

2242
02:03:33,479 --> 02:04:05,250
Everyone in the chat was fucking screaming at me to shoot you.

2243
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:08,489
They would like crouch down here and wait for him to shoot him in the back of the head.

2244
02:04:08,489 --> 02:04:11,489
And I was like, guys, we have to play the goddamn game.

2245
02:04:11,489 --> 02:04:12,489
I grabbed that.

2246
02:04:12,489 --> 02:04:13,489
Huh?

2247
02:04:13,489 --> 02:04:16,069
I'm going to get you.

2248
02:04:16,069 --> 02:04:17,439
Oh, you should.

2249
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:18,439
All right.

2250
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:19,680
Let's go.

2251
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,680
Where are we going?

2252
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,920
Oh, we have the map.

2253
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,909
Yeah.

2254
02:04:25,909 --> 02:04:26,909
You get the map?

2255
02:04:26,909 --> 02:04:27,909
How do you go to that way?

2256
02:04:27,909 --> 02:04:28,909
I don't see.

2257
02:04:28,909 --> 02:04:33,289
Can you see it?

2258
02:04:33,289 --> 02:04:34,590
Yeah.

2259
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:35,590
All right.

2260
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:37,659
Let's go.

2261
02:04:37,659 --> 02:04:38,659
We're going to the white zone.

2262
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:39,899
Okay.

2263
02:04:39,899 --> 02:04:40,899
We're going to the white circle.

2264
02:04:40,899 --> 02:04:41,899
White circle.

2265
02:04:41,899 --> 02:04:42,899
Go.

2266
02:04:42,899 --> 02:04:43,899
Shoot him.

2267
02:04:43,899 --> 02:04:48,409
He shot me.

2268
02:04:48,409 --> 02:04:53,939
I didn't shoot you.

2269
02:04:53,939 --> 02:04:54,939
My screen's red.

2270
02:04:54,939 --> 02:04:55,939
We've got to go back.

2271
02:04:55,939 --> 02:04:57,239
We've got to go back.

2272
02:04:57,239 --> 02:04:59,060
Why do I have to go back?

2273
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,060
I didn't bring any health.

2274
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:01,680
Maybe it was just his blood going on me.

2275
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,680
I don't know.

2276
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,680
I'm waiting for you.

2277
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,680
I'm over here.

2278
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,680
Can you see me?

2279
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:06,680
Okay.

2280
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:07,680
I'll go first.

2281
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:08,680
That actually looked kind of cool.

2282
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,680
How do I run faster?

2283
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,680
You have to aim your gun down, then you move faster.

2284
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:29,300
You do?

2285
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,300
I think so.

2286
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:37,050
If you have it up and aiming, you move slower.

2287
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:41,550
You have to have your hands down at your side.

2288
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:42,550
Hey, we're going this way.

2289
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:44,050
Okay.

2290
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:59,819
We look like fucking assholes right now, by the way.

2291
02:05:59,819 --> 02:06:00,819
Just wanted to make sure you're aware of that.

2292
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:01,819
Double cleave.

2293
02:06:01,819 --> 02:06:02,819
Double cleave.

2294
02:06:02,819 --> 02:06:04,439
Double cleave.

2295
02:06:04,439 --> 02:06:05,439
Double cleave.

2296
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:06,439
Double cleave.

2297
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:11,649
Double cleave.

2298
02:06:11,649 --> 02:06:13,340
Double cleave.

2299
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:14,340
Double cleave.

2300
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:15,340
Double cleave.

2301
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,340
Double cleave.

2302
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,340
Double cleave.

2303
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:21,329
Double cleave.

2304
02:06:21,329 --> 02:06:22,329
Double cleave.

2305
02:06:22,329 --> 02:06:23,329
Double cleave.

2306
02:06:23,329 --> 02:06:33,720
Double cleave.

2307
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,720
Double cleave.

2308
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,720
Double cleave.

2309
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,720
Make sure you're aware of that.

2310
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:37,720
Double cleave.

2311
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:44,720
Nice work.

2312
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:48,970
What is this?

2313
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:49,970
Oh shit.

2314
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:56,090
Give it, give it, give it a go.

2315
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:58,090
Help, help, help, help me.

2316
02:06:58,090 --> 02:07:04,899
Good job.

2317
02:07:04,899 --> 02:07:07,100
I don't have a light.

2318
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:17,100
I can do what Leon Kennedy does.

2319
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,100
You want this?

2320
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:20,659
Uh, yeah.

2321
02:07:20,659 --> 02:07:23,569
Good.

2322
02:07:23,569 --> 02:07:30,380
Oh my fucking god.

2323
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:35,840
You were like the most unprepared mercenary.

2324
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:41,439
unprepared mercenary. I see. I'm dropping my guns, there's my flashlight, I'm like wait hold on.

2325
02:07:42,079 --> 02:07:45,840
All right, like let's go. I don't even care, we're going. Just shine your light.

2326
02:07:49,090 --> 02:07:53,810
You know you left your rifle here. I don't have any more ammo for it. Watch out behind you.

2327
02:07:53,810 --> 02:08:36,369
Whoa whoa whoa! That's why. Is there a clip in here? I have any fucking idea. All right,

2328
02:08:36,369 --> 02:08:47,949
put your guns down and move. Hold on, cover me. All right, covering you. All right,

2329
02:08:48,029 --> 02:09:19,710
I want to look at this map. Yeah, we gotta go left here. Right here? Hey! Hold on. We're even

2330
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:26,340
pretty heavy over there. I know I gotta. How do you aim this? I'm just putting on like cologne,

2331
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:49,140
right? Let's move. Is it down here? Yeah. All right, I'll tell you something. I will tell you.

2332
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:55,220
It is so sweaty in my visor right now. It's like I have goggles on and I'm under water.

2333
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:59,140
I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Okay. I'm not at 100% right now. I'm

2334
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:21,899
at like 30% vision. Where are we going? We're going the right way, right? Yeah.

2335
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:34,779
There's like a... How many bullets do I have? Behind you. Behind you. Watch out.

2336
02:10:38,659 --> 02:10:50,060
I gotta be out of bullets. That's like 10. Yeah. Hey, you know when you go into a pool that...

2337
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:54,220
Stop doing that. You know when you go into a pool and the pool is like a public pool

2338
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:58,930
because a bunch of kids like shit and piss in the pool and stuff? Yeah. And then when you

2339
02:10:58,930 --> 02:11:02,609
get out of that pool, all you see is the haze surrounding everything. The lights all have

2340
02:11:02,609 --> 02:11:06,130
rainbows on them and shit. You're saying you're the kid that shit in the pool?

2341
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:15,840
Precisely. Pretty much. Like when you go underwater in a public pool and you open

2342
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,600
your eyes, shit is flowing into your eyes. It's clean shit. It's been cleaned. Hey. Hey,

2343
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:25,600
Donnie. Bet you can't hit that Zed from here. I bet you I can if you just give me a minute

2344
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:37,979
here. One shot. One shot, Donnie. The new player has joined the game. Oh, no.

2345
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:45,600
How did we get here? It's better not be like a hacker. Hold on. I'll get it. Was the Zed?

2346
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:56,319
All right. Where is it? You're lagging so much now. Which one? Either. Pick one.

2347
02:11:57,039 --> 02:12:09,899
But you can't wait till he gets that close. Come on, Donnie. My turn. Watch out behind

2348
02:12:09,899 --> 02:12:22,220
you. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Oops. I'm getting hacked. All right. I see a safe

2349
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:33,630
house. You're doing all right. Are you putting me out here? Is this like the let's play a game

2350
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:39,840
with Jerma and then when his back is turned? Oh, no. We're going to go this way. I don't

2351
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:47,920
have any weapons left. I need to switch this, by the way. I don't like this, by the way. I

2352
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:58,930
don't want to do this, by the way. Oh, inside of there. There's a house. I don't know what

2353
02:12:59,090 --> 02:13:18,779
this green arrow is. The green circle. Uh oh. What? No. Got it. Jack's activated. Watch out.

2354
02:13:18,779 --> 02:13:36,699
It's the clock tower, girl. Back me up here. Back me up here, please. I am. Uh oh. Back me

2355
02:13:36,699 --> 02:13:46,829
up. Back me up. Back me up here. Star. Star. Star, I don't know what to do. I'll shine the

2356
02:13:46,829 --> 02:14:23,539
light on you. Shoot him. Where's my guns? All right. Jesus. OK. Why can I not take that?

2357
02:14:23,539 --> 02:14:41,010
There we go. All right. I'm helpful. I'm your personal floodlight. You tell me where you want

2358
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:43,970
it to shine. Why don't we check the houses? There might be ammo because they don't have

2359
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:50,699
anything. Can I have your axe? I have a lot of ammo. Dad, can I have your axe? Can I play

2360
02:14:50,699 --> 02:15:02,939
the axe? Do you need ammo? Yeah. What is, what guns is for? I don't, I don't have

2361
02:15:02,939 --> 02:15:10,060
this kind of gun. Oh, well. It's not the right gun. You can't hit me or no? No. OK,

2362
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:16,699
someone, someone is outside. You have to go with him. But you have a drain? Uh,

2363
02:15:16,699 --> 02:15:42,579
let's go, let's go. One, two. There may have been a misunderstanding.

2364
02:15:43,539 --> 02:16:08,380
A player has left the game. He was just trying to help. He was trying to help. He was a good

2365
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:18,060
guy. And you just fucking blew him away. He came up behind us. Yeah, but he's, zombies

2366
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:30,220
don't talk. Where am I? Where's my character? Did I like pull a cord out? What? Am I

2367
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:51,120
running around? I covered my headset. Hello, I'm here. Hi. Hi. Did I put like sweat on

2368
02:16:51,120 --> 02:17:05,090
the headset? Is it like, doesn't know where I am? Wait a minute. OK, hold on. This is,

2369
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:22,270
hey, kill me. It's a bug. Just shoot me. Just, OK. Oh my God, that was fucking

2370
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:30,260
outrageous. Are you killing me, please? You're dead. Guy comes in to like help.

2371
02:17:31,219 --> 02:17:35,780
It's like, hey, we're gonna go this way. It says a full three or four sentences. I thought

2372
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:41,219
he was a zombie, right? He was a zombie. But he got even worse. I can't see anything.

2373
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:46,100
I was trying to protect you. Oh, that was fucking ridiculous. He just wanted to help.

2374
02:17:47,729 --> 02:18:03,840
And then he was like, he was like, this guy sucks. And he left. I feel like we've

2375
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:07,040
done this so many times. I'm like, I'm going to work again. You know what I mean?

2376
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:11,520
All right, just get the fucking ammo. Hey, watch out. There's a zombie behind you.

2377
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:16,530
I think this person has full leg tracking, by the way.

2378
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:24,899
You're a zombie. Prove you're not a zombie. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't

2379
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:31,579
do it. Put it down. She's infected. No, no, they're not. Stop. No reason.

2380
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:33,579
Put it down.

2381
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:41,889
Only one of us is making it out of here alive. It's gonna be me.

2382
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:00,940
Okay, I'm done. I'm out of here.

2383
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:19,840
All right. Let's get this show on the road. Day four. Let's get ready. Let's get ready.

2384
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:24,559
Let's go. Let's get ready. Okay. What time is it? All right. Let's go over here.

2385
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:29,680
I just clucked in. I was like fucking goofball clown stream. There it is. Okay,

2386
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:34,479
here we go. Let's go over here. Hey, I pick up the sniper rifle. That's what I do typically

2387
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:39,920
on the first day. You know, grab two of these, three of these. Well, let me load that one.

2388
02:19:40,719 --> 02:19:44,799
Okay. Where's where are those sites? You know, the sites are up here, I think.

2389
02:19:44,799 --> 02:19:48,079
I don't know how to put them on. I think they go like this somehow.

2390
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:52,159
But they never actually attach. I think it's very different gun

2391
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:58,370
because they keep saying no way. That's the only sniper rifle. Why would like

2392
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:09,739
this big scope isn't going to go on here? It keeps saying whoops. I just put that into my head.

2393
02:20:10,379 --> 02:20:14,989
I just like video drone that into my head. Maybe we should do the tutorial.

2394
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:20,190
Maybe we should have done the tutorial. Hey, hold on. Hey, look at me.

2395
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:26,780
Hold on. Let me get a good close look at you. You might need to have a little bit

2396
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:32,190
of skin work done on your pores there. I can't even see you. Well, don't shoot it.

2397
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:35,709
Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. You're going to do it right here. Right through the

2398
02:20:35,709 --> 02:20:50,190
scope. What the fuck am I looking at here? Like what you see. Hold on. This is like upside down.

2399
02:20:50,909 --> 02:21:24,510
It is upside down. Am I missing something here? Oh, there we go. Mounting a scope on a scope.

2400
02:21:25,709 --> 02:21:34,350
That almost worked. I can't fucking. All right. I want to get something attached here.

2401
02:21:35,069 --> 02:21:43,950
What was it? Was it grip? They keep saying no. I feel like with the flashlight on this one,

2402
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:47,149
I just put it near the area and it attaches. I don't even have to press anything.

2403
02:21:47,709 --> 02:22:04,510
Somebody help us out here. Read the sign. Read the sign. Read the sign. Read the sign.

2404
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:14,639
Out here. Read the sign. Oh. Anybody see sign? No, the sign's right here. Sign.

2405
02:22:14,639 --> 02:22:20,610
You need to find the journal to be able to attach things. What? What do you mean find the

2406
02:22:20,610 --> 02:22:29,059
journal? Look right here. Where? Oh, that. Right. All right. So aren't you able to mount

2407
02:22:29,059 --> 02:22:34,420
an attachment? Find related in three seconds. Try to shoot each other in the journal. Three,

2408
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:51,709
two, one. I missed that other guy. I know. Yeah, I do too. I would have loved to have another

2409
02:22:51,709 --> 02:22:54,750
player here to have fun with and like know what they were doing, know what he was going.

2410
02:22:55,809 --> 02:22:58,370
But no, I have to shoot that guy. I have to shoot him. I have to unload a whole

2411
02:22:58,370 --> 02:23:01,489
clip on him and then I have to like. To be fair. Do a die hard bit with him.

2412
02:23:01,489 --> 02:23:13,950
The second time I shot myself. Yes, you did. Okay. What else? What other games do we have?

2413
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:19,389
Desert bus. Desert bus. We're not doing desert bus yet. That's the 12 hour stream for later.

2414
02:23:21,069 --> 02:23:26,479
What's the other one? Tabletop tennis. Nobody wants to see that shit.

2415
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:28,639
No one wants to see that shit. Nobody wants to see that shit. It's fun,

2416
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:34,979
but nobody wants to see that shit. We also got. We got two more. What are the other three games?

2417
02:23:38,299 --> 02:23:43,420
I have no idea. What are they? Oh, bar fight. Oh, the bar fight game. Yeah,

2418
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:48,940
we're going to play bar fight. Tabletop tennis. And then desert bus.

2419
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:55,040
We can go do bar fight. You want to do bar fight?

2420
02:23:55,040 --> 02:24:00,879
I want to. Hey, let's do one PVP. Do is jet island multiplayer. I actually

2421
02:24:00,879 --> 02:24:04,719
brought up jet island to this guy here, but they said, what did you say? You can,

2422
02:24:04,719 --> 02:24:07,840
you can explain it. I don't remember what is jet island.

2423
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,840
The way you go really fast and you have those tethers.

2424
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:14,479
You said that you were going to throw up if we played. Oh, no, that was gun haven.

2425
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:17,040
I said I would vomit over gun haven. Well, if you're going to throw up,

2426
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:19,280
I don't know what jet island is. Oh, he, guys, he doesn't even know

2427
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:24,540
what jet island is. He can't even play gun haven. All right, you want to do PVP?

2428
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:31,020
PVP outside of here, though. No bullshit. You only get one gun.

2429
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:32,860
Well, no, no, no. We'll get all the, what do you call those guns?

2430
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:37,739
You got a ton of guns on you. Go out that door. I'll go out this door

2431
02:24:37,739 --> 02:24:41,979
and like inside the fenced area, PVP. What do you mean? What's the fenced area?

2432
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:44,780
Like right outside this whole area is fenced in.

2433
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:49,180
So you're talking about like out of this room. No, no, no. Get back in here.

2434
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:51,819
I want to examine your shit. Come here. Let me see.

2435
02:24:51,819 --> 02:24:58,139
In case you have, you have a large supersized Uzi. You have a regular Uzi.

2436
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:01,500
Okay. Is that all you have? That's it.

2437
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:04,700
Okay. I have a handgun in my pocket.

2438
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:09,540
Okay. I'm going to go with handgun. It was a very stupid way to pick that up.

2439
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:19,059
Okay. Gun safety. Okay. Gun.

2440
02:25:20,819 --> 02:25:22,899
I'm also going to go. Are we allowed to have first aid?

2441
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:28,100
No. Okay. Fine. Oops.

2442
02:25:28,739 --> 02:25:49,620
What are you doing? Never mind.

2443
02:25:49,620 --> 02:26:03,899
All right. I'm going with this. This speaks to me. This is all I need.

2444
02:26:08,059 --> 02:26:11,659
Okay. I'm going out there. So we're going to do like,

2445
02:26:11,659 --> 02:26:14,299
are we doing a 10 paces thing and then we'll turn around and let go?

2446
02:26:14,299 --> 02:26:16,860
No. We're just, as soon as you're out here, if we see each other.

2447
02:26:17,659 --> 02:26:20,399
Okay. So we're out like this door here. You mean like out here?

2448
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:23,120
No. The other door. Okay. So I'm going.

2449
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:29,920
You ready? You're not doing it right.

2450
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,950
You don't understand. No, you don't understand.

2451
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:40,020
I don't want to hit the wall. I'm like, I'm trying to associate myself.

2452
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:43,600
So I don't hit the wall. Go outside.

2453
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:46,139
I'm just tangled. God damn it.

2454
02:26:47,809 --> 02:26:55,010
Hold on. I'm just tangled up here. All right. Let's go. You ready?

2455
02:26:55,729 --> 02:27:52,799
What? Oh, shit. It's me.

2456
02:27:52,799 --> 02:27:56,959
All right. That's two out of three. Handguns only. No, like no rapid fire bullshit.

2457
02:27:56,959 --> 02:27:59,280
We're talking about weapons that were like before like the 1900s.

2458
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,040
You know what I'm saying? Only single shot handguns.

2459
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,399
Yeah. Weapons that were like used in the civil war.

2460
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:10,879
Only single shot handguns. Weapons that were created back in the 1930s.

2461
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,829
None of this bullshit. None of this like rat tat tat bullshit.

2462
02:28:17,549 --> 02:28:23,379
We're talking shotgun pistol. I'm just it's pistol time.

2463
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:35,409
No, no, no, no. I went back in the 1950s.

2464
02:28:35,409 --> 02:28:36,850
They didn't have flashlights on their guns.

2465
02:28:37,409 --> 02:28:47,170
Fine. You will pull that. You only get one handgun by the way.

2466
02:28:48,909 --> 02:28:50,909
I don't know. One shotgun. I'm ready.

2467
02:28:50,909 --> 02:28:52,909
I'm turning to yell at that to you for some reason.

2468
02:28:56,819 --> 02:29:15,680
I'm outside. I'm ready. Wait, wait. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

2469
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:21,969
I'm just making sure you're ready. Are you ready?

2470
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:30,129
I'm ready. I'm coming.

2471
02:29:33,579 --> 02:29:34,459
Trying to get my foot in here.

2472
02:29:39,389 --> 02:29:39,889
Coming.

2473
02:30:11,979 --> 02:30:13,659
Sitting there entrenched.

2474
02:30:16,379 --> 02:30:19,819
I'm trying to like bait you. I've got the flashlight bouncing.

2475
02:30:20,459 --> 02:30:21,819
All right. That's two out of three.

2476
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:25,200
Just get a handgun. No shotguns.

2477
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,799
Oh no. You know what? Fucking handguns only.

2478
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:29,440
Only handguns. No slappers.

2479
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:31,440
No. No handguns. Only flashlight.

2480
02:30:33,229 --> 02:30:34,989
Okay. Hold on a minute here. Let me go.

2481
02:30:37,549 --> 02:30:40,319
Okay. Just making sure it works.

2482
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:16,159
You're going to die. I'm right behind you.

2483
02:32:41,760 --> 02:33:01,899
I mean, I still have my gun. God, just deal with me.

2484
02:33:01,899 --> 02:33:03,819
Oh, you fucking liar. You liar.

2485
02:33:03,819 --> 02:33:06,459
Post. Host bullshit. Host bullshit.

2486
02:33:08,190 --> 02:33:13,700
Got him.

2487
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:14,819
That was actually fun.

2488
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:21,899
Like I didn't want to play the PVP military VR games because it seemed.

2489
02:33:21,899 --> 02:33:23,950
What, Pavlov?

2490
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:24,670
Yeah.

2491
02:33:24,670 --> 02:33:26,540
What do you got against Pavlov?

2492
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:30,299
Nothing. Now that we've had the 1v1.

2493
02:33:30,299 --> 02:33:32,879
We were going to play Pavlov.

2494
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,899
This is a mess underneath me.

2495
02:33:35,899 --> 02:33:38,219
All right. Last one. Sniper rifles only.

2496
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:50,239
Okay. You ready?

2497
02:33:53,979 --> 02:33:55,979
We've got to count to like 30 seconds, by the way.

2498
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:10,559
Okay. You ready?

2499
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:59,809
Yeah.

2500
02:34:59,809 --> 02:35:04,799
What? How? How are you doing that?

2501
02:35:06,299 --> 02:35:06,940
What?

2502
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:13,920
How did you? I don't know who you were.

2503
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:16,190
I flanked you.

2504
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:25,120
All right. This game's fun.

2505
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:27,840
We were doing a lot of shit talking at the tutorial.

2506
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:33,040
Because the tutorial isn't good. Everything else.

2507
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,549
This is really fun, though.

2508
02:35:35,549 --> 02:35:40,190
I could see like getting two, possibly three people in here.

2509
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:42,290
And the third person like kind of knows what they're doing.

2510
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:43,729
It's like trying to give like some advice.

2511
02:35:46,770 --> 02:35:47,409
Fun, I think.

2512
02:35:56,139 --> 02:35:57,739
All right. I'm going to get some water.

2513
02:35:57,739 --> 02:35:58,940
You want to take like a two minute break?

2514
02:36:00,219 --> 02:36:00,780
Sure.

2515
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:02,379
Just to get out of the headset. Get some water.

2516
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:04,940
Drunken bar fight or?

2517
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:06,540
Drunken bar fight is next.

2518
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:07,420
Or bus next.

2519
02:36:08,299 --> 02:36:09,180
How long have we been going?

2520
02:36:10,139 --> 02:36:11,260
That's a good question. Let's find out.

2521
02:36:16,579 --> 02:36:17,620
Just about two and a half hours.

2522
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:22,989
We'll do drunken bar fight.

2523
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:28,979
And then from drunken bar fight we'll go to a desert bus.

2524
02:36:31,069 --> 02:36:31,389
Okay.

2525
02:36:32,459 --> 02:36:36,430
So go grab yourself a water and we'll return.

2526
02:36:37,250 --> 02:36:38,209
I'm going to hydrate up.

2527
02:36:40,530 --> 02:36:42,049
Don't you need to get drunk for that?

2528
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,309
Theoretically, no.

2529
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:48,180
I've been drunk this whole time.

2530
02:36:48,819 --> 02:36:49,780
All right. Be right back.

2531
02:36:50,420 --> 02:40:31,709
Hello.

2532
02:40:31,709 --> 02:40:35,329
We are just waiting for stir.

2533
02:40:35,329 --> 02:40:42,399
And then we can continue with the drunken bar fight.

2534
02:40:42,399 --> 02:40:45,870
As we'll just get it open now.

2535
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:48,739
Oh, you're here.

2536
02:40:50,620 --> 02:40:50,940
Okay.

2537
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:51,579
Yep.

2538
02:40:51,579 --> 02:40:55,840
Now let's figure out how we jump into this as a team.

2539
02:40:58,930 --> 02:41:01,489
I missed. I missed massive bits, did I?

2540
02:41:02,129 --> 02:41:10,030
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.

2541
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:16,399
Yeah, yeah, we did.

2542
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,159
Bloody doctor.

2543
02:41:18,959 --> 02:41:21,549
Thank you, bloody, if you're bloody doctor, if you're still here.

2544
02:41:23,379 --> 02:41:26,659
Is a 50 dollars, 5,000 bits from bloody doctor.

2545
02:41:26,659 --> 02:41:27,379
Thank you so much.

2546
02:41:30,579 --> 02:41:31,620
Sorry I missed it.

2547
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:35,120
I was immersed in virtual reality.

2548
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:40,700
But they said you should mute stir on discord and use the in game voice.

2549
02:41:40,700 --> 02:41:47,229
It's more immersive, but it's not as crisp.

2550
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:50,139
Yeah, we're all about crispness here.

2551
02:41:50,139 --> 02:41:51,020
You're not as crispy.

2552
02:41:51,659 --> 02:41:55,299
Oh, by the way, I just burped and tasted food.

2553
02:41:55,299 --> 02:41:57,459
So I'm going to tell you a little story about a dream I had last night.

2554
02:41:57,459 --> 02:41:58,260
You're going to like this one.

2555
02:41:58,979 --> 02:42:01,840
So you're, you're aware of the chef Gordon Ramsay, right?

2556
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:03,680
Um, yes.

2557
02:42:04,239 --> 02:42:08,239
So I had a dream that I went to one of his kitchen nightmares restaurants.

2558
02:42:09,469 --> 02:42:09,950
With him.

2559
02:42:10,750 --> 02:42:14,750
Me, Kim and Gordon Ramsay, it went to one of his kitchen nightmares.

2560
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:16,190
I like the idea.

2561
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:17,549
I'm coming back to check on it.

2562
02:42:17,549 --> 02:42:18,510
You know, he does that sometimes.

2563
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:19,389
I was there for some reason.

2564
02:42:19,389 --> 02:42:19,870
I don't know why.

2565
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:23,489
So we sit down at the table.

2566
02:42:23,489 --> 02:42:24,610
We try a bunch of the food.

2567
02:42:24,610 --> 02:42:25,729
He's ordering a bunch of shit.

2568
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:28,290
And me and Kim are like, oh, this is delicious.

2569
02:42:28,290 --> 02:42:28,930
This is great.

2570
02:42:28,930 --> 02:42:29,889
He's like, what do you think about that?

2571
02:42:29,889 --> 02:42:31,090
Isn't that much more tender?

2572
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:32,450
We're like, yeah, it's great.

2573
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:35,489
So anyways, we eat like, I don't know, a hundred dollars worth of food

2574
02:42:35,489 --> 02:42:36,370
and the check comes.

2575
02:42:37,489 --> 02:42:42,850
And I was having like this in dream panic of do I have to pick up this check?

2576
02:42:43,729 --> 02:42:45,729
And Gordon Ramsay was like kind of looking at it.

2577
02:42:45,729 --> 02:42:48,930
I was looking at it with like, I was like, is the show paying for this?

2578
02:42:49,569 --> 02:42:50,450
I didn't say that.

2579
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:53,569
And like, I kind of got up and was moving around this check.

2580
02:42:53,569 --> 02:42:56,209
Like that check is laying on the table and neither one of us are touching it.

2581
02:42:58,219 --> 02:42:59,899
And then I woke up panicking.

2582
02:42:59,899 --> 02:43:02,500
It could be worse.

2583
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:03,459
It could have been way worse.

2584
02:43:03,459 --> 02:43:03,620
Yeah.

2585
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:04,979
But like that it was weird.

2586
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:08,129
It was an actual dream.

2587
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:12,290
I had a dream recently that was I told my stream.

2588
02:43:12,290 --> 02:43:15,250
I mean, Donald Trump were laying in bed together staring at the ceiling

2589
02:43:15,250 --> 02:43:17,489
and he was telling me how bad he felt.

2590
02:43:18,209 --> 02:43:22,319
And I was just listening to him and I felt bad for him.

2591
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:23,040
And then I woke up.

2592
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:24,799
Yeah.

2593
02:43:24,799 --> 02:43:26,639
He was like, people really don't like me anymore.

2594
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,280
It's really weird.

2595
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,239
Scott, let me tell you.

2596
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:32,379
I don't know what it is about people.

2597
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:33,739
They don't like me.

2598
02:43:33,739 --> 02:43:34,379
I don't know why.

2599
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:37,729
All right.

2600
02:43:37,729 --> 02:43:38,450
Are you inviting me?

2601
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:39,489
Yeah.

2602
02:43:40,659 --> 02:43:40,979
Okay.

2603
02:43:40,979 --> 02:43:43,299
I just clicked a hey German meet me at the bar.

2604
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:48,260
You know, you know, I really wish you'd make TF2 videos again.

2605
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:52,180
It really, I would love that.

2606
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:52,500
All right.

2607
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:57,440
Uh, the first thing he said, hold on.

2608
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:59,100
I can't hear you.

2609
02:43:59,100 --> 02:43:59,579
Don't talk.

2610
02:43:59,579 --> 02:44:01,340
Oh, but there's a guy that drives.

2611
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:01,579
Yeah.

2612
02:44:01,579 --> 02:44:04,780
There's a guy that drives by the house like 15 times a day going like

2613
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:06,860
40, 50 miles per hour in a God damn neighborhood.

2614
02:44:07,739 --> 02:44:10,239
Just making an appearance on every stream.

2615
02:44:14,670 --> 02:44:16,420
Hold on.

2616
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:17,620
Oh, yeah.

2617
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:18,420
Why are you doing this to me?

2618
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:18,819
Headset.

2619
02:44:22,159 --> 02:44:22,399
All right.

2620
02:44:22,399 --> 02:44:26,959
One more drink of my officially not sponsored Canada dry ginger ale.

2621
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,639
And I mean that for real.

2622
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:29,120
It's not.

2623
02:44:31,979 --> 02:44:32,299
Okay.

2624
02:44:32,940 --> 02:44:33,500
Can you see me?

2625
02:44:34,059 --> 02:44:35,260
You guys can't see anything.

2626
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:35,500
Why?

2627
02:44:37,729 --> 02:44:38,450
Oh, that's why.

2628
02:44:52,350 --> 02:44:53,950
Ginger ale isn't hydration.

2629
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:55,229
There's plenty of water in that.

2630
02:44:57,100 --> 02:44:59,579
Ginger ale just like when you drink ginger ale.

2631
02:45:00,139 --> 02:45:01,979
It instantly forms gas.

2632
02:45:01,979 --> 02:45:03,579
It shoots out of your system.

2633
02:45:03,579 --> 02:45:06,989
It's the worst soft drink because I love it though.

2634
02:45:06,989 --> 02:45:07,979
All right.

2635
02:45:07,979 --> 02:45:08,540
What's new?

2636
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,379
Waiting, waiting for you at the bar.

2637
02:45:10,379 --> 02:45:13,739
Said you'd be here looking at my, looking at my watch.

2638
02:45:13,739 --> 02:45:14,540
Said you'd be here.

2639
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:31,329
Okay.

2640
02:45:31,329 --> 02:45:33,620
So where are you at?

2641
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:36,340
Hold on.

2642
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:37,780
Don't don't don't don't don't.

2643
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:38,260
Nobody move.

2644
02:45:38,819 --> 02:45:41,489
Now you can move.

2645
02:45:46,610 --> 02:45:48,989
Hey, Jerma, meet at the bar.

2646
02:45:49,790 --> 02:45:52,899
How do we do that?

2647
02:45:52,899 --> 02:45:54,299
Meet at the bar.

2648
02:45:58,209 --> 02:45:59,729
How do you have two hours in this game?

2649
02:46:00,450 --> 02:46:02,750
That's how long I've been waiting for you.

2650
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:04,510
If you've already played this.

2651
02:46:05,389 --> 02:46:07,870
No, I've been sitting here waiting at the bar.

2652
02:46:07,870 --> 02:46:08,430
1.8 hours.

2653
02:46:08,989 --> 02:46:09,229
All right.

2654
02:46:09,229 --> 02:46:11,920
How do I accept your invite?

2655
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:12,719
I don't know.

2656
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:19,969
No, this is wrong.

2657
02:46:25,309 --> 02:46:26,110
Meet me at the bar.

2658
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,299
Why did you play drug and bar fight?

2659
02:46:29,299 --> 02:46:30,020
I pressed the button.

2660
02:46:32,610 --> 02:46:33,489
I pressed the button.

2661
02:46:34,290 --> 02:46:34,690
Help me.

2662
02:46:35,409 --> 02:46:40,879
I don't know.

2663
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:42,959
That's all I can do is invite you.

2664
02:46:42,959 --> 02:46:43,920
Messages on top.

2665
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:46,510
Top right you see messages.

2666
02:46:50,979 --> 02:46:51,860
Show keyboard.

2667
02:46:56,610 --> 02:46:57,489
Drug and bar fight.

2668
02:46:58,209 --> 02:47:01,729
I don't have anything from you.

2669
02:47:01,729 --> 02:47:02,129
How do I?

2670
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:04,540
I have six things from you.

2671
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:04,780
Click.

2672
02:47:08,909 --> 02:47:10,030
No, I don't want to join.

2673
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:12,510
It's Alex's Rimworld stream.

2674
02:47:13,309 --> 02:47:14,370
All right.

2675
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:14,770
I'm going.

2676
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:16,979
Play game.

2677
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:33,059
I'm trying.

2678
02:47:33,059 --> 02:47:33,860
I'm promise.

2679
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:34,819
I'm trying.

2680
02:47:34,819 --> 02:47:35,299
Did you go off?

2681
02:47:35,299 --> 02:47:36,420
I believe you.

2682
02:47:36,420 --> 02:47:37,700
No, I'm I'm in the bar.

2683
02:47:41,329 --> 02:47:42,690
You accepted an invitation.

2684
02:47:43,709 --> 02:47:44,110
Okay.

2685
02:47:44,829 --> 02:47:49,020
What the fuck is happening?

2686
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:51,309
Are we here?

2687
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:53,250
Are you in there?

2688
02:47:54,129 --> 02:47:54,930
Are you in the bar?

2689
02:47:55,969 --> 02:47:56,930
I got a loading screen.

2690
02:48:08,079 --> 02:48:08,639
There you are.

2691
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:09,760
That's you.

2692
02:48:10,479 --> 02:48:13,440
Hey, what's a good country band to get into to sell my look?

2693
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:14,399
I don't know which one is you.

2694
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:16,639
I'm the one sitting at the laptop.

2695
02:48:25,870 --> 02:48:27,629
Hey, behind you.

2696
02:48:27,629 --> 02:48:29,229
Anyone got anything that'll wake me up?

2697
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:31,229
You're sitting over here.

2698
02:48:31,229 --> 02:48:31,709
That's you.

2699
02:48:32,350 --> 02:48:33,469
I'm sitting at the laptop.

2700
02:48:35,469 --> 02:48:38,850
You trying to start a fight?

2701
02:48:40,819 --> 02:48:42,420
Something fucking weird is happening.

2702
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:43,600
What?

2703
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,079
Why?

2704
02:48:44,079 --> 02:48:44,559
Okay.

2705
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:44,959
Okay.

2706
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:50,219
What's going on with my room here?

2707
02:48:50,219 --> 02:48:50,459
Why?

2708
02:48:50,459 --> 02:48:51,420
What's with my hands?

2709
02:48:52,139 --> 02:48:57,409
Come on.

2710
02:48:57,969 --> 02:48:59,809
This is such a fucking YouTuber game.

2711
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:01,649
It really is.

2712
02:49:01,649 --> 02:49:03,729
It's not like one to one for some reason for me.

2713
02:49:08,530 --> 02:49:09,809
Not the napkin dispenser.

2714
02:49:11,649 --> 02:49:12,049
Get up.

2715
02:49:12,610 --> 02:49:19,540
The bartender won't serve you down there.

2716
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:21,700
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

2717
02:49:21,700 --> 02:49:22,659
Who's this guy?

2718
02:49:22,659 --> 02:49:28,430
Happy New Year.

2719
02:49:29,309 --> 02:49:30,430
Happy New Year.

2720
02:49:31,229 --> 02:49:31,950
That was fun.

2721
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:32,430
We did it.

2722
02:49:33,389 --> 02:49:33,870
That was it.

2723
02:49:37,069 --> 02:49:39,069
You can't just immediately start fights.

2724
02:49:42,209 --> 02:49:43,489
He doesn't even know you're doing it.

2725
02:49:43,489 --> 02:49:43,969
Let me show you.

2726
02:49:43,969 --> 02:49:44,930
All right.

2727
02:49:44,930 --> 02:49:45,409
Where are you?

2728
02:49:52,610 --> 02:49:54,530
Are you trying to stick his head through?

2729
02:49:55,649 --> 02:50:01,139
Are you hitting me?

2730
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:08,700
This is the jankiest game ever.

2731
02:50:09,579 --> 02:50:12,079
I'm up.

2732
02:50:12,959 --> 02:50:13,920
Oh, he's part of the fight.

2733
02:50:14,719 --> 02:50:22,780
Oh, tips.

2734
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,819
Oh, I'll take these bits.

2735
02:50:24,459 --> 02:50:29,700
I got your back.

2736
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:30,500
I got your back.

2737
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:31,379
No, I got your back.

2738
02:50:51,739 --> 02:50:52,940
We're taking out the whole bar.

2739
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:06,719
Get everybody involved.

2740
02:51:06,719 --> 02:51:07,840
Get everyone involved.

2741
02:51:12,479 --> 02:51:12,799
All right.

2742
02:51:12,799 --> 02:51:14,239
Concentrate up.

2743
02:51:14,239 --> 02:51:15,120
Strategy, strategy.

2744
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:18,719
We got to start strolling because we got to get everybody before the cops show up.

2745
02:51:18,719 --> 02:51:19,040
Okay.

2746
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:19,920
So how do you want to do this?

2747
02:51:22,659 --> 02:51:23,780
Get the weapons in the right place.

2748
02:51:27,489 --> 02:51:28,450
Everything is a weapon.

2749
02:51:29,170 --> 02:51:33,760
This guy's a walking cane.

2750
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:35,040
I'm going in.

2751
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:36,319
I'm going Indiana Jones style.

2752
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:37,920
You ready?

2753
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:38,639
Oh, my God.

2754
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:40,290
Hit him.

2755
02:51:46,239 --> 02:51:53,260
Hey, hey, who's whipping me?

2756
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:15,659
I'm trying to get this guy in the fucking teeth.

2757
02:52:16,459 --> 02:52:22,459
All right.

2758
02:52:22,459 --> 02:52:23,500
Quick, I got to try to get away.

2759
02:52:29,709 --> 02:52:30,909
Also, there's another bar.

2760
02:52:31,629 --> 02:52:32,909
I don't know how to leave this one now.

2761
02:52:34,930 --> 02:52:36,129
No, I didn't mean to do that.

2762
02:52:36,129 --> 02:52:36,690
Let's do it.

2763
02:52:41,489 --> 02:52:43,659
Where did you get the whip?

2764
02:52:43,659 --> 02:52:49,379
Oh, this is my fantasy.

2765
02:52:52,959 --> 02:52:54,610
All right.

2766
02:52:54,610 --> 02:52:55,489
Come on, come on, come on.

2767
02:52:57,010 --> 02:52:59,010
You flew across the whole screen for me.

2768
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:01,409
Get up.

2769
02:53:01,409 --> 02:53:01,809
Get up.

2770
02:53:01,809 --> 02:53:02,209
Help me.

2771
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,559
Help me.

2772
02:53:04,559 --> 02:53:05,040
Pick me up.

2773
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:06,239
What?

2774
02:53:07,299 --> 02:53:07,700
Wow.

2775
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:12,510
This is crap.

2776
02:53:12,510 --> 02:53:14,030
What the fuck did we just see?

2777
02:53:14,030 --> 02:53:14,989
All those teeth.

2778
02:53:14,989 --> 02:53:15,709
Okay.

2779
02:53:15,709 --> 02:53:16,030
All right.

2780
02:53:16,030 --> 02:53:16,829
This guy's got to go.

2781
02:53:17,389 --> 02:53:18,190
What did I just do?

2782
02:53:19,069 --> 02:53:20,110
Oh, German.

2783
02:53:20,829 --> 02:53:21,229
Hold on.

2784
02:53:21,229 --> 02:53:21,629
Hold on.

2785
02:53:21,629 --> 02:53:22,190
Emergency.

2786
02:53:22,989 --> 02:53:28,340
All right.

2787
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:28,979
I got an idea.

2788
02:53:28,979 --> 02:53:30,899
Get a bunch of weapons up there.

2789
02:53:30,899 --> 02:53:31,780
We got to fucking push it.

2790
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:32,659
Look at me.

2791
02:53:32,659 --> 02:53:33,940
I want to see if this looks...

2792
02:53:34,899 --> 02:53:38,819
I was lifting my legs with my own guitar.

2793
02:53:38,819 --> 02:53:39,620
Is you going to sit on...

2794
02:53:43,819 --> 02:53:46,620
That's so, so fucking stupid.

2795
02:53:49,139 --> 02:53:49,860
I'm going to kick you.

2796
02:53:50,579 --> 02:53:52,059
Wait, wait, wait.

2797
02:53:52,059 --> 02:53:52,860
Hold on.

2798
02:53:52,860 --> 02:54:00,430
How are you doing that?

2799
02:54:05,809 --> 02:54:07,120
All right.

2800
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:07,520
We got to...

2801
02:54:08,159 --> 02:54:08,959
Hold on.

2802
02:54:08,959 --> 02:54:11,979
Whose phone is this?

2803
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:19,280
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2804
02:54:19,280 --> 02:54:20,399
I don't want to do that.

2805
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:20,930
Here.

2806
02:54:20,930 --> 02:54:21,969
Open your mouth.

2807
02:54:21,969 --> 02:54:22,530
No, no, no.

2808
02:54:22,530 --> 02:54:22,930
You.

2809
02:54:22,930 --> 02:54:23,170
You.

2810
02:54:28,139 --> 02:54:28,700
I'm drunk.

2811
02:54:29,819 --> 02:54:30,860
Hey, open up, bro.

2812
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:36,190
Open up, bro.

2813
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:40,540
Devil's Cocktail.

2814
02:54:41,569 --> 02:54:42,530
I call this one.

2815
02:54:42,530 --> 02:54:44,610
The bartender won't serve you down there.

2816
02:54:44,610 --> 02:54:46,450
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

2817
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:50,110
Come on, bro.

2818
02:54:50,110 --> 02:54:50,590
Yeah, it's...

2819
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:54,739
Cherry sauce, vodka, and a Guinness.

2820
02:54:58,219 --> 02:54:59,979
I don't know how to go to the other bar.

2821
02:54:59,979 --> 02:55:01,100
I don't know how to do anything.

2822
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:02,299
Can we just walk out the door?

2823
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:04,459
I couldn't walk all the way there.

2824
02:55:09,360 --> 02:55:09,920
All right, let's go.

2825
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:10,879
I'm done.

2826
02:55:10,879 --> 02:55:11,520
Turn my way.

2827
02:55:12,319 --> 02:55:12,799
I can't...

2828
02:55:12,799 --> 02:55:13,600
You get stuck here.

2829
02:55:14,559 --> 02:55:17,700
You get the fuck out of here.

2830
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:18,340
Get out of here.

2831
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:21,780
Did he just drop kick me?

2832
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:22,420
I think he did.

2833
02:55:30,239 --> 02:55:30,639
Oh, boy.

2834
02:55:30,639 --> 02:55:32,479
The bartender won't serve you down there.

2835
02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:33,520
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

2836
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:34,319
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2837
02:55:36,450 --> 02:55:37,329
I've got the play.

2838
02:55:39,069 --> 02:55:40,110
Come here, come here.

2839
02:55:40,110 --> 02:55:40,590
Have you seen me?

2840
02:55:40,590 --> 02:55:41,309
What's the play?

2841
02:55:41,309 --> 02:55:44,270
I want you are going to one-v-one mail him.

2842
02:55:44,270 --> 02:55:44,510
Yeah, yeah.

2843
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:45,549
All right, what's going on, bro?

2844
02:55:45,549 --> 02:55:46,030
What do you want to do?

2845
02:55:46,829 --> 02:55:47,549
I want you...

2846
02:55:47,549 --> 02:55:48,510
You can take that guy on.

2847
02:55:48,510 --> 02:55:49,069
What's up?

2848
02:55:49,069 --> 02:55:49,629
That guy right there?

2849
02:55:49,629 --> 02:55:50,590
That guy in the bar.

2850
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:50,829
Yeah.

2851
02:55:50,829 --> 02:55:51,870
That fucking piece of shit.

2852
02:55:51,870 --> 02:55:52,270
What'd he do?

2853
02:55:53,629 --> 02:55:54,670
Did he talk shit to you?

2854
02:55:56,110 --> 02:55:58,110
He said I look like Mickey Mouse.

2855
02:55:58,110 --> 02:55:59,469
Oh, man, bro.

2856
02:55:59,469 --> 02:56:00,270
I'll just...

2857
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:00,750
Wait.

2858
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:01,149
Hold on.

2859
02:56:01,149 --> 02:56:01,469
You good?

2860
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:02,850
You good?

2861
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:03,889
You good?

2862
02:56:03,889 --> 02:56:04,370
You good?

2863
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:04,930
Man, come on.

2864
02:56:04,930 --> 02:56:05,250
Light up.

2865
02:56:05,250 --> 02:56:05,649
You good?

2866
02:56:05,649 --> 02:56:05,969
All right.

2867
02:56:05,969 --> 02:56:06,290
You good?

2868
02:56:09,870 --> 02:56:10,110
Hey.

2869
02:56:10,829 --> 02:56:13,549
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, excuse me.

2870
02:56:14,590 --> 02:56:15,549
My buddy over there.

2871
02:56:15,549 --> 02:56:18,270
Uh, you tell me he looks like a fucking cartoon character?

2872
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:18,829
Is that what you said?

2873
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:21,069
Mickey Mouse.

2874
02:56:21,709 --> 02:56:24,989
Kind of like that fucking Mickey Mouse fucking necklace you got on, right?

2875
02:56:26,590 --> 02:56:28,610
Finish him.

2876
02:56:29,889 --> 02:56:30,510
All right.

2877
02:56:31,709 --> 02:56:37,139
Don't you ever say shit to my friend again.

2878
02:56:37,139 --> 02:56:38,100
What are you looking at?

2879
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:38,600
Fucker.

2880
02:56:51,709 --> 02:56:53,229
I can't even look.

2881
02:56:53,229 --> 02:56:55,500
You don't have to.

2882
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:59,500
Next time, you should pick yourself up.

2883
02:57:07,299 --> 02:57:12,260
This is like 0.1% of GTA if it was in VR.

2884
02:57:12,579 --> 02:57:13,079
Oh.

2885
02:57:15,139 --> 02:57:16,020
Dude, you should have seen.

2886
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:17,059
You're going like this, man.

2887
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:19,299
It's fucking hilarious.

2888
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,780
I miss my fucking laptop.

2889
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:22,579
All right.

2890
02:57:22,579 --> 02:57:23,780
Can we get out of this bar?

2891
02:57:24,899 --> 02:57:27,280
Don't fight me, buddy.

2892
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:28,000
Just wait.

2893
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:28,799
Just walk out here.

2894
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:31,090
Hold on, man.

2895
02:57:42,049 --> 02:57:42,930
You sicko.

2896
02:57:43,809 --> 02:57:45,489
All right.

2897
02:57:45,489 --> 02:57:47,090
Let's get the fuck out of here.

2898
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:49,489
Was that fucked up?

2899
02:57:49,489 --> 02:57:50,690
You could never leave.

2900
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:51,489
Was that fucked up?

2901
02:57:57,260 --> 02:57:57,760
All right.

2902
02:58:00,459 --> 02:58:01,100
Just right.

2903
02:58:07,219 --> 02:58:08,340
I didn't do anything.

2904
02:58:08,899 --> 02:58:09,940
Why are you fighting me?

2905
02:58:11,219 --> 02:58:12,340
I didn't do shit.

2906
02:58:13,219 --> 02:58:15,139
He's the one guy.

2907
02:58:15,139 --> 02:58:18,100
Your character is so fucking lanky.

2908
02:58:31,780 --> 02:58:33,540
Maybe next time, you should pick yourself up.

2909
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:33,860
All right.

2910
02:58:33,860 --> 02:58:34,579
All right.

2911
02:58:34,579 --> 02:58:35,219
Exit menu.

2912
02:58:35,219 --> 02:58:35,620
Hit menu.

2913
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:36,659
Hit menu.

2914
02:58:36,659 --> 02:58:37,620
I don't know how.

2915
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:37,860
Oh.

2916
02:58:38,659 --> 02:58:39,940
Let's hit menu to get out of this bar.

2917
02:58:41,979 --> 02:58:42,299
All right.

2918
02:58:42,299 --> 02:58:43,020
Let's go to another bar.

2919
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:43,739
What is the menu?

2920
02:58:45,260 --> 02:58:46,860
It's top right button on the bar.

2921
02:58:49,139 --> 02:58:50,260
Trigger to play again.

2922
02:58:50,260 --> 02:58:50,500
Okay.

2923
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:51,059
No, I left.

2924
02:58:51,860 --> 02:58:52,420
Are we together?

2925
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:54,100
No.

2926
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:55,459
I can invite you to the other bar.

2927
02:58:55,459 --> 02:58:56,739
I think there's only two.

2928
02:58:56,739 --> 02:58:57,860
Let's go to the other bar.

2929
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:58,899
I'm going to fucking puke.

2930
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:01,659
Oh, no.

2931
02:59:01,659 --> 02:59:02,379
There's like a...

2932
02:59:03,180 --> 02:59:05,649
Okay.

2933
02:59:05,649 --> 02:59:05,969
Hold on.

2934
02:59:05,969 --> 02:59:06,370
Hold on.

2935
02:59:08,989 --> 02:59:11,069
If I get KO'd, you have to pick yourself up.

2936
02:59:11,069 --> 02:59:12,030
Can you go in the elevator?

2937
02:59:12,829 --> 02:59:13,549
Oh, shit.

2938
02:59:13,549 --> 02:59:15,069
You can go in the goddamn elevator.

2939
02:59:16,270 --> 02:59:18,270
I don't see you online to invite anymore.

2940
02:59:18,829 --> 02:59:19,469
Oh, no.

2941
02:59:20,750 --> 02:59:22,829
There's a bar up top, too, man.

2942
02:59:22,829 --> 02:59:23,069
Yeah.

2943
02:59:23,069 --> 02:59:23,950
That's where I am right now.

2944
02:59:23,950 --> 02:59:25,149
I'm at the supply party.

2945
02:59:25,149 --> 02:59:25,709
Are you here?

2946
02:59:27,069 --> 02:59:27,709
Should I invite you?

2947
02:59:27,709 --> 02:59:29,469
No, because we have to actually join each other.

2948
02:59:29,469 --> 02:59:29,709
Yeah.

2949
02:59:29,709 --> 02:59:31,389
How did you join off the invite?

2950
02:59:31,389 --> 02:59:32,590
Uh, I just...

2951
02:59:32,590 --> 02:59:33,389
So I went to the...

2952
02:59:35,889 --> 02:59:36,690
This is going to be a bad...

2953
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:37,649
It's going to be a problem here.

2954
02:59:39,409 --> 02:59:41,729
You go into your, like, SteamVR menu.

2955
02:59:42,450 --> 02:59:43,649
Oh, I'm going to, like, mess...

2956
02:59:43,649 --> 02:59:43,969
You got me?

2957
02:59:43,969 --> 02:59:45,250
Hey, German, meet me at the bar.

2958
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:47,739
Are you coming to me?

2959
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:49,899
I send you an invite.

2960
02:59:49,899 --> 02:59:50,620
Okay, I'm coming to you.

2961
02:59:54,129 --> 02:59:55,809
When you see this shit, you're going to be, uh...

2962
02:59:58,500 --> 02:59:59,540
You're going to be a little, uh...

2963
02:59:59,540 --> 03:00:01,219
You're going to be a little shocked by what you see.

2964
03:00:02,899 --> 03:00:04,180
How are the cops going to get up here?

2965
03:00:05,059 --> 03:00:05,540
I don't know.

2966
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:06,100
Are you...

2967
03:00:07,219 --> 03:00:07,940
Did I join you?

2968
03:00:09,780 --> 03:00:10,500
I don't think so.

2969
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:10,979
I don't see you.

2970
03:00:10,979 --> 03:00:11,860
You accepted an invitation.

2971
03:00:14,420 --> 03:00:15,139
Do I have to leave?

2972
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:21,489
You accepted an invitation to play drug and bar fight.

2973
03:00:21,489 --> 03:00:22,129
Okay.

2974
03:00:22,129 --> 03:00:24,770
So, meet me at the bar.

2975
03:00:25,729 --> 03:00:30,049
I might have to leave.

2976
03:00:30,850 --> 03:00:32,049
Yeah, I got to be, like, in the...

2977
03:00:32,049 --> 03:00:33,170
I got to be, like, in the main venue.

2978
03:00:34,209 --> 03:00:37,409
I once cured the shingles, and then I realized I could make more money.

2979
03:00:37,409 --> 03:00:37,969
What is this?

2980
03:00:39,659 --> 03:00:40,159
Oh.

2981
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:44,000
Man, lots of low-flying planes around here.

2982
03:00:45,969 --> 03:00:47,090
Okay, I think it just said, yes.

2983
03:00:48,049 --> 03:00:49,649
Sir, please don't speak with me.

2984
03:00:49,649 --> 03:00:51,170
My therapist recommends I don't talk to you.

2985
03:00:51,170 --> 03:00:52,049
Okay, I have, like, a phone.

2986
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:54,209
Wait, let me just get the fuck out of here.

2987
03:00:54,209 --> 03:00:54,770
How do I fight?

2988
03:00:56,260 --> 03:00:57,059
Sir, where are you?

2989
03:00:57,059 --> 03:00:57,559
Sir?

2990
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:04,100
There we go.

2991
03:01:04,100 --> 03:01:04,579
Okay, all right.

2992
03:01:04,579 --> 03:01:04,819
All right.

2993
03:01:04,819 --> 03:01:05,860
It loaded me in, finally.

2994
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:06,739
All right.

2995
03:01:06,739 --> 03:01:07,459
I'll go find you.

2996
03:01:08,420 --> 03:01:09,329
Watch out.

2997
03:01:09,329 --> 03:01:10,690
I'm going to use my new technique.

2998
03:01:10,690 --> 03:01:11,569
You got a new technique?

2999
03:01:13,969 --> 03:01:18,000
You okay?

3000
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,879
I once cured the shingles, and then I realized I could make more money.

3001
03:01:20,879 --> 03:01:21,440
Oh, no.

3002
03:01:21,440 --> 03:01:21,920
You, uh...

3003
03:01:22,719 --> 03:01:23,280
You want a drink?

3004
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,309
Here, come here.

3005
03:01:25,309 --> 03:01:25,629
Come here.

3006
03:01:25,629 --> 03:01:26,270
Have some of this.

3007
03:01:26,270 --> 03:01:26,770
Yeah.

3008
03:01:32,350 --> 03:01:35,870
This is the most uncomfortable I've done in my life.

3009
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:36,370
You want some?

3010
03:01:38,270 --> 03:01:40,190
That's my wall.

3011
03:01:42,659 --> 03:01:43,620
Go over here.

3012
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:44,120
Yes.

3013
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:50,719
Can you pop that open?

3014
03:01:51,790 --> 03:01:52,290
No.

3015
03:01:58,670 --> 03:01:59,149
All right, come on.

3016
03:01:59,149 --> 03:01:59,649
Ready?

3017
03:02:00,190 --> 03:02:01,309
Oh, they're all coming.

3018
03:02:01,309 --> 03:02:01,870
Behind you.

3019
03:02:05,629 --> 03:02:06,129
What?

3020
03:02:07,729 --> 03:02:09,729
I can't pick myself up.

3021
03:02:09,729 --> 03:02:11,010
How do you pick yourself up?

3022
03:02:12,450 --> 03:02:14,909
The bartender won't serve you down there.

3023
03:02:14,909 --> 03:02:15,409
No, no.

3024
03:02:15,409 --> 03:02:16,909
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

3025
03:02:16,909 --> 03:02:18,110
You still alive.

3026
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:19,469
You're still fine.

3027
03:02:21,649 --> 03:02:23,170
Is that a firecracker?

3028
03:02:24,049 --> 03:02:25,729
Did you shoot a Roman candle?

3029
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:27,250
There's like...

3030
03:02:27,250 --> 03:02:28,450
There's these whole big...

3031
03:02:28,450 --> 03:02:30,610
I don't know how these are called, but it blew up.

3032
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:34,100
Whoa!

3033
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:35,280
Wow, that's so funny.

3034
03:02:38,989 --> 03:02:39,709
Watch out!

3035
03:02:39,709 --> 03:02:40,590
What are you doing?

3036
03:02:41,149 --> 03:02:41,649
Stop!

3037
03:02:42,510 --> 03:02:43,639
Stop it!

3038
03:02:44,340 --> 03:02:44,840
Watch out!

3039
03:02:45,299 --> 03:02:45,799
Watch out!

3040
03:02:46,100 --> 03:02:59,620
I don't understand.

3041
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:01,700
All right, no more.

3042
03:03:01,700 --> 03:03:02,819
I gotta like pick you up?

3043
03:03:04,670 --> 03:03:08,110
Yeah, if I go down, you can come over and grab me and pull me up.

3044
03:03:08,110 --> 03:03:08,670
All right, hold on.

3045
03:03:08,670 --> 03:03:09,629
Sometimes it works.

3046
03:03:09,629 --> 03:03:10,430
Come here for a second.

3047
03:03:11,309 --> 03:03:11,809
What is this?

3048
03:03:15,170 --> 03:03:16,049
I didn't mean to.

3049
03:03:16,049 --> 03:03:17,090
Look, I'm drunk.

3050
03:03:17,090 --> 03:03:17,969
I want to do something.

3051
03:03:18,610 --> 03:03:19,729
Oh my god!

3052
03:03:19,729 --> 03:03:20,229
Come over here.

3053
03:03:21,010 --> 03:03:23,309
Come over here and uh...

3054
03:03:23,309 --> 03:03:23,870
Come over here and uh...

3055
03:03:23,870 --> 03:03:24,750
Dad, mom, dad, yes.

3056
03:03:24,750 --> 03:03:25,790
You know what I mean? Put your hand here.

3057
03:03:29,459 --> 03:03:29,959
Right?

3058
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:31,299
My wall's right there.

3059
03:03:31,299 --> 03:03:32,020
Hold on.

3060
03:03:32,020 --> 03:03:33,540
Oh shit, my wall's right there too.

3061
03:03:34,860 --> 03:03:35,360
Ow!

3062
03:03:36,190 --> 03:03:36,690
I can't.

3063
03:03:37,940 --> 03:03:38,440
Right?

3064
03:03:38,739 --> 03:03:51,010
I'm going for the bombs.

3065
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:54,940
No, don't go for the bombs.

3066
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:56,459
Get that out of here!

3067
03:03:56,459 --> 03:03:56,959
No!

3068
03:04:02,190 --> 03:04:05,309
Nobody else was even remotely involved.

3069
03:04:05,309 --> 03:04:06,909
No one, no one is bothered.

3070
03:04:09,469 --> 03:04:10,909
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

3071
03:04:10,909 --> 03:04:11,950
These two assholes.

3072
03:04:12,510 --> 03:04:14,030
Playing with toys over here.

3073
03:04:14,030 --> 03:04:15,069
Like killing each other.

3074
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:19,760
All right, okay.

3075
03:04:20,319 --> 03:04:25,069
Did you take pictures?

3076
03:04:30,639 --> 03:04:39,299
How does this work?

3077
03:04:39,299 --> 03:04:40,020
That wasn't very good.

3078
03:04:41,059 --> 03:04:41,559
Excuse me.

3079
03:04:45,379 --> 03:04:46,340
I'm just looking.

3080
03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:46,840
Let's go.

3081
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:47,459
Come over this way.

3082
03:04:54,719 --> 03:04:55,760
Nobody's talking anymore.

3083
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,280
This is my sister's wedding.

3084
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:59,979
I give it two years.

3085
03:04:59,979 --> 03:05:01,180
No, no, wait, wait.

3086
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:01,680
You wait.

3087
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:03,180
I'm waiting.

3088
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:05,739
I'm just joining the conversation with my vase that I brought.

3089
03:05:07,379 --> 03:05:08,260
You're trying to like...

3090
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:10,819
Feed Jeff Bezos.

3091
03:05:18,190 --> 03:05:21,180
This is fucking terrifying.

3092
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:22,700
It's like up his nose.

3093
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:24,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3094
03:05:24,219 --> 03:05:25,340
I want to see if I can balance it.

3095
03:05:25,979 --> 03:05:32,000
Did you ding him?

3096
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:32,559
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3097
03:05:32,559 --> 03:05:33,120
What's he doing?

3098
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:37,620
Wait, give it a whine.

3099
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:39,059
Oops.

3100
03:05:43,540 --> 03:05:44,420
Who are we feeding?

3101
03:05:45,059 --> 03:05:46,690
That's fair enough.

3102
03:05:46,690 --> 03:05:50,000
All right, he's a little bit boozed up.

3103
03:05:52,319 --> 03:05:56,799
Perfect timing.

3104
03:06:09,250 --> 03:06:10,129
Easy over there.

3105
03:06:10,690 --> 03:06:12,989
Hey, you enjoyed the wedding?

3106
03:06:12,989 --> 03:06:14,110
You guys enjoyed the wedding?

3107
03:06:14,110 --> 03:06:15,549
Yeah, I love this couple.

3108
03:06:15,549 --> 03:06:17,149
They're so fucking friendly.

3109
03:06:17,149 --> 03:06:20,590
My favorite thing, if you've had the wine yet, it's fantastic.

3110
03:06:20,590 --> 03:06:22,350
Hey, if you don't like the three snooges.

3111
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:23,309
Oh, come on.

3112
03:06:23,309 --> 03:06:23,809
Damn it.

3113
03:06:25,309 --> 03:06:26,030
Hey, my favorite.

3114
03:06:26,030 --> 03:06:26,829
Oh, what's this?

3115
03:06:33,059 --> 03:06:35,059
Why can't we just sit here for an hour and behave?

3116
03:06:36,020 --> 03:06:37,219
All right, here's the deal.

3117
03:06:37,219 --> 03:06:37,860
You ready for the game?

3118
03:06:39,409 --> 03:06:39,889
Where are you?

3119
03:06:41,739 --> 03:06:47,309
The game is you have to let go of that.

3120
03:06:48,750 --> 03:06:49,250
No.

3121
03:06:49,870 --> 03:06:50,430
Stop it.

3122
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:52,430
I was just doing fireworks for the party.

3123
03:06:52,430 --> 03:06:53,709
No, you're going to piss people off.

3124
03:06:54,350 --> 03:06:55,069
I'm down?

3125
03:06:55,069 --> 03:06:55,870
I got you, I got you.

3126
03:06:56,829 --> 03:06:58,989
Okay, all right.

3127
03:06:58,989 --> 03:07:01,709
The goal is stand in the...

3128
03:07:04,979 --> 03:07:05,459
What the fuck?

3129
03:07:06,739 --> 03:07:08,500
All right, when you settle down, Kylo Ren.

3130
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:14,899
Get away from me.

3131
03:07:15,760 --> 03:07:16,799
Get the fuck away from me.

3132
03:07:29,020 --> 03:07:32,690
It's a crab.

3133
03:07:34,590 --> 03:07:35,549
It's going for your legs.

3134
03:07:36,350 --> 03:07:43,090
I'm like the kid in the party.

3135
03:07:43,090 --> 03:07:45,489
Yeah, you're like the annoying little shit

3136
03:07:46,129 --> 03:07:48,049
that's running around and bumping into people.

3137
03:07:57,360 --> 03:07:59,280
Wait, I wonder, can they punch me when I'm down here?

3138
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:00,399
I'm just chapped right now.

3139
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:05,700
They just keep punching this lady in the face.

3140
03:08:10,739 --> 03:08:11,860
I'm winning this fight.

3141
03:08:11,860 --> 03:08:14,739
This is bizarre, I'll tell you.

3142
03:08:15,620 --> 03:08:18,100
What about your fucking animals, you know what I'm saying?

3143
03:08:18,739 --> 03:08:26,579
Look at your ankles.

3144
03:08:42,110 --> 03:08:43,069
Nice.

3145
03:08:43,069 --> 03:08:44,750
Get me, get me, get me up, get me up, get me up.

3146
03:08:44,750 --> 03:08:45,389
I'm down.

3147
03:08:45,389 --> 03:08:46,829
Oh, turn, quick, quick, quick.

3148
03:08:47,709 --> 03:08:48,270
Over here.

3149
03:08:49,149 --> 03:08:49,629
They're coming.

3150
03:08:55,100 --> 03:08:55,739
How do you win?

3151
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:57,899
Do you win?

3152
03:08:58,700 --> 03:08:59,500
I don't think you win.

3153
03:09:00,219 --> 03:09:01,020
Wait, hold on a second.

3154
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,620
Don't hurt anybody, just give me move people.

3155
03:09:05,139 --> 03:09:06,579
I want to throw someone off the roof.

3156
03:09:09,299 --> 03:09:17,659
Fuck, help me.

3157
03:09:18,459 --> 03:09:19,500
I'm down, I'm down.

3158
03:09:20,299 --> 03:09:22,209
I'm down, lift me up.

3159
03:09:27,059 --> 03:09:29,090
I won't serve you down there.

3160
03:09:29,090 --> 03:09:30,610
Maybe next time you should put yourself out there.

3161
03:09:30,610 --> 03:09:31,409
What are you doing?

3162
03:09:31,409 --> 03:09:33,969
I thought you of all people would appreciate a double middle finger.

3163
03:09:33,969 --> 03:09:35,010
Oh, that's what you were doing?

3164
03:09:35,729 --> 03:09:36,049
Yeah.

3165
03:09:37,010 --> 03:09:46,219
Hey, what do you got to say about these?

3166
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:56,860
Wait, stop.

3167
03:09:56,860 --> 03:10:10,909
DJ plays goodbye horses.

3168
03:10:10,909 --> 03:10:12,510
That's my favorite song to dance to.

3169
03:10:13,389 --> 03:10:17,260
Hey, hey, excuse me.

3170
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:27,569
He tried to run off the roof.

3171
03:10:27,569 --> 03:10:40,510
Hey, hey, I'm down.

3172
03:10:40,670 --> 03:10:43,620
Help, get me.

3173
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:47,729
Nice.

3174
03:10:53,969 --> 03:10:55,170
I can get myself up?

3175
03:10:56,850 --> 03:10:58,770
Why can I not take a single punch to the face?

3176
03:10:59,809 --> 03:11:00,450
All right, that's it.

3177
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:04,799
All right, come over here.

3178
03:11:04,799 --> 03:11:05,200
Come with me.

3179
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:05,760
Don't hurt anybody.

3180
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:06,079
Get over here.

3181
03:11:08,079 --> 03:11:09,200
Okay, here's the deal.

3182
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:10,399
I'm going to go on.

3183
03:11:10,399 --> 03:11:11,920
I'm going to get support his body.

3184
03:11:12,559 --> 03:11:13,520
You support his legs.

3185
03:11:14,159 --> 03:11:17,200
We're going to one, two, three, throw them over the edge.

3186
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:19,840
Hold on, stay there.

3187
03:11:21,440 --> 03:11:23,920
Okay, so you don't like that the practical is wrong, but you kneel behind.

3188
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

3189
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:25,840
You ready?

3190
03:11:29,280 --> 03:11:29,760
Ready?

3191
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:32,079
Here, he's kind of come up with his legs up.

3192
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,389
It's like grabbing him.

3193
03:11:50,370 --> 03:11:51,170
Where are you?

3194
03:11:51,170 --> 03:12:03,170
So, you know there's a Halloween version of this game too, right?

3195
03:12:04,450 --> 03:12:07,969
I'm sure it changed the game dramatically.

3196
03:12:08,530 --> 03:12:12,059
It's going to be 300k in a month.

3197
03:12:12,059 --> 03:12:14,299
I piss 300k daily.

3198
03:12:14,299 --> 03:12:16,670
My face is as high as I'm supposed to win.

3199
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:33,899
Is that Gilford Godfrey?

3200
03:12:34,860 --> 03:12:35,649
It sounds like him.

3201
03:12:35,649 --> 03:12:36,690
Is that Dry Bear?

3202
03:12:36,690 --> 03:12:38,209
It does sound like Godfrey.

3203
03:12:38,209 --> 03:12:39,329
Gilford Godfrey.

3204
03:12:39,329 --> 03:12:40,129
Gilford Godfrey.

3205
03:12:40,129 --> 03:12:40,690
I got him.

3206
03:12:40,690 --> 03:12:41,489
I got him.

3207
03:12:41,489 --> 03:12:41,729
No.

3208
03:12:42,450 --> 03:12:43,090
What, you got him?

3209
03:12:44,049 --> 03:12:45,090
He almost went off.

3210
03:12:58,659 --> 03:12:59,620
It's really like this.

3211
03:13:00,739 --> 03:13:02,420
All right, I'll take two more of these.

3212
03:13:03,379 --> 03:13:10,780
This guy's hanging on for his life.

3213
03:13:11,579 --> 03:13:18,979
I'm done.

3214
03:13:18,979 --> 03:13:19,459
I'm dead.

3215
03:13:19,940 --> 03:13:20,659
I'm dead.

3216
03:13:20,659 --> 03:13:21,219
I died.

3217
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:31,500
It's just the same shit over and over again.

3218
03:13:31,500 --> 03:13:32,059
But it's-

3219
03:13:32,059 --> 03:13:34,059
Yeah, so how about that desert buzz?

3220
03:13:34,059 --> 03:13:34,459
I know.

3221
03:13:34,459 --> 03:13:35,739
How about desert buzz, huh?

3222
03:13:39,819 --> 03:13:40,940
Hey, actually, you know what?

3223
03:13:40,940 --> 03:13:42,059
We need to do the 1v1.

3224
03:13:43,020 --> 03:13:43,979
1v1 here?

3225
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:45,180
Yeah.

3226
03:13:45,180 --> 03:13:45,819
All right, fine.

3227
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:53,819
It's all about the intimidation factor, guys.

3228
03:13:56,819 --> 03:13:57,059
How do I-

3229
03:13:57,059 --> 03:13:59,219
Can I turn my body without turning-

3230
03:14:00,020 --> 03:14:01,299
I don't think I can.

3231
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:02,100
No.

3232
03:14:08,379 --> 03:14:09,739
Hey, you want to see what I got?

3233
03:14:09,739 --> 03:14:11,819
Hey, hey, come at me.

3234
03:14:11,819 --> 03:14:12,620
You want to come at me?

3235
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:13,659
Are you scared now?

3236
03:14:13,659 --> 03:14:14,299
Intimidated?

3237
03:14:14,299 --> 03:14:15,420
How about I do it again, huh?

3238
03:14:24,989 --> 03:14:25,309
Hey.

3239
03:14:46,540 --> 03:14:48,860
You just brought me back to life.

3240
03:14:48,860 --> 03:14:49,819
Big mistake.

3241
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:57,090
Are you down?

3242
03:15:09,549 --> 03:15:11,229
Okay, I have a headache.

3243
03:15:11,229 --> 03:15:11,950
Yeah, I do too.

3244
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:14,129
I have a fucking bad headache.

3245
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:17,459
All right, we got to get everybody.

3246
03:15:17,459 --> 03:15:17,860
You ready?

3247
03:15:19,059 --> 03:15:21,379
Oh, I have a headache means we're getting everybody.

3248
03:15:21,379 --> 03:15:22,500
Well, then we should be throwing bombs.

3249
03:15:24,100 --> 03:15:24,979
All right, stop, stop, stop.

3250
03:15:24,979 --> 03:15:25,379
Wait, stop, stop.

3251
03:15:25,379 --> 03:15:25,860
Slow down, slow down.

3252
03:15:25,860 --> 03:15:26,739
We got to get this slow down.

3253
03:15:29,809 --> 03:15:30,209
Easy.

3254
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:34,059
Are these candles?

3255
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:38,129
No, these are the bombs.

3256
03:15:38,770 --> 03:15:41,090
Make sure they're not like shaky toys.

3257
03:15:42,450 --> 03:15:42,930
I'm sure.

3258
03:15:43,569 --> 03:15:43,889
Okay.

3259
03:15:44,610 --> 03:15:44,930
Ready?

3260
03:15:45,809 --> 03:15:48,219
How about-

3261
03:15:48,219 --> 03:15:49,500
What's the fuse time?

3262
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:49,979
Oh, God.

3263
03:15:49,979 --> 03:15:53,579
I'm seizing them.

3264
03:15:53,579 --> 03:15:54,299
I'm allergic.

3265
03:15:55,100 --> 03:16:02,559
The bartender won't serve you down there.

3266
03:16:02,559 --> 03:16:04,799
I can't even believe you survived until 40.

3267
03:16:17,260 --> 03:16:18,780
And then I realized I can make more money.

3268
03:16:34,590 --> 03:16:34,909
What?

3269
03:16:34,909 --> 03:16:35,870
I just fell over?

3270
03:16:39,629 --> 03:16:42,590
This really quickly went from bar fight to acts of terrorism.

3271
03:16:55,899 --> 03:16:57,260
Why am I getting switched?

3272
03:16:59,629 --> 03:17:01,549
On my screen, I'm standing on top of you.

3273
03:17:01,950 --> 03:17:09,870
I snuck up here and sabotaged this place

3274
03:17:09,870 --> 03:17:11,709
since they're stealing all the customers from my-

3275
03:17:36,879 --> 03:17:37,600
God damn it.

3276
03:17:38,319 --> 03:17:39,520
What are you doing?

3277
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:40,879
I'm fucking sitting down, man.

3278
03:17:40,879 --> 03:17:42,319
I'm going to fucking pass out.

3279
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,739
Looking up at your face.

3280
03:17:46,750 --> 03:17:47,469
So fucking-

3281
03:17:55,620 --> 03:17:56,979
It's not like this is not-

3282
03:17:56,979 --> 03:17:57,459
I don't know.

3283
03:17:57,459 --> 03:17:57,780
My-

3284
03:17:57,780 --> 03:17:58,420
Something's-

3285
03:17:58,420 --> 03:17:59,299
Okay, where am I?

3286
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:01,379
Guys, I understand something.

3287
03:18:02,180 --> 03:18:03,709
I didn't do this.

3288
03:18:04,670 --> 03:18:07,170
This was another reason why I was laughing.

3289
03:18:09,659 --> 03:18:10,860
What am I doing on your screen?

3290
03:18:12,180 --> 03:18:14,100
Your arms are crossed like this.

3291
03:18:14,100 --> 03:18:14,739
They shouldn't be.

3292
03:18:15,860 --> 03:18:18,770
Are you holding the wrong controller?

3293
03:18:18,770 --> 03:18:20,610
No, I got the straps on.

3294
03:18:22,879 --> 03:18:25,600
There's no way that my hands came out of the straps,

3295
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:27,520
through the other straps.

3296
03:18:28,860 --> 03:18:29,340
No way.

3297
03:18:30,059 --> 03:18:34,530
That could not have happened, right?

3298
03:18:35,090 --> 03:18:36,370
There's no way on the ground.

3299
03:18:38,799 --> 03:18:39,200
I don't-

3300
03:18:39,200 --> 03:18:40,079
No, that's impossible.

3301
03:19:09,840 --> 03:19:11,600
Don't ask me, I have no idea.

3302
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:12,399
No, that makes no sense,

3303
03:19:12,399 --> 03:19:13,440
because look, this is my left hand.

3304
03:19:14,559 --> 03:19:15,040
You understand?

3305
03:19:15,040 --> 03:19:15,920
This is the left hand.

3306
03:19:45,500 --> 03:19:55,139
Are you still alive?

3307
03:19:58,540 --> 03:20:00,540
The bartender won't serve you down there.

3308
03:20:00,540 --> 03:20:02,299
Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.

3309
03:20:02,299 --> 03:20:02,860
I didn't see-

3310
03:20:04,860 --> 03:20:06,139
My daddy's on bitcoin.

3311
03:20:06,139 --> 03:20:09,180
He's gotta be worth 300,000 dollars in about two months.

3312
03:20:09,819 --> 03:20:11,260
All right, how do we get out of here?

3313
03:20:13,020 --> 03:20:13,659
How do we get out?

3314
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,799
Oh my god.

3315
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:23,200
What if we gotta get the cake?

3316
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:32,719
How do we get the cake?

3317
03:20:38,059 --> 03:20:38,620
Real helpful.

3318
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:49,020
Bankrupted.

3319
03:20:56,159 --> 03:20:57,920
I honestly don't even know how you're doing that.

3320
03:21:05,459 --> 03:21:10,479
Can you grab my hands?

3321
03:21:29,219 --> 03:21:31,059
Bring me the candle.

3322
03:21:31,860 --> 03:21:33,120
Bring me the candle.

3323
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:37,170
This is how I want to go.

3324
03:21:37,170 --> 03:21:37,889
No, you dropped it.

3325
03:21:37,889 --> 03:21:38,389
Come here.

3326
03:21:41,440 --> 03:21:48,850
I want to eat it, I want to eat it.

3327
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:49,729
Oh, I'm up.

3328
03:21:49,729 --> 03:21:50,590
I'm up.

3329
03:21:50,590 --> 03:21:51,790
This is what a beat up looks like.

3330
03:21:52,989 --> 03:22:07,020
Can we beat one level, please?

3331
03:22:09,120 --> 03:22:09,760
I got him.

3332
03:22:18,879 --> 03:22:19,600
You don't win.

3333
03:22:21,520 --> 03:22:22,879
It's a metaphor.

3334
03:22:27,629 --> 03:22:28,190
Give me the knife.

3335
03:22:30,239 --> 03:22:30,959
Excuse me?

3336
03:22:31,520 --> 03:22:32,479
I'm not doing that.

3337
03:22:34,399 --> 03:22:34,959
What?

3338
03:22:34,959 --> 03:22:35,840
Why did it do that?

3339
03:22:44,610 --> 03:22:50,399
Hey, you want a pickle?

3340
03:22:50,399 --> 03:22:51,360
Oh no, there's a wine.

3341
03:22:52,860 --> 03:22:53,579
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3342
03:22:58,049 --> 03:22:59,250
Will you please get up?

3343
03:23:00,290 --> 03:23:00,790
No.

3344
03:23:17,569 --> 03:23:21,170
Brother!

3345
03:23:21,170 --> 03:23:22,860
Could you?

3346
03:23:22,860 --> 03:23:25,739
You're just causing me so much fucking anguish.

3347
03:23:28,049 --> 03:23:36,239
Protect me.

3348
03:23:41,090 --> 03:23:41,809
I read it one.

3349
03:24:03,969 --> 03:24:05,170
I'm exhausted.

3350
03:24:06,049 --> 03:24:07,170
I'm exhausted.

3351
03:24:10,319 --> 03:24:12,559
Let me help you, let me help you, let me help you, let me help you, let me help you.

3352
03:24:13,280 --> 03:24:13,920
Give me the- wait.

3353
03:24:16,479 --> 03:24:16,959
You're back.

3354
03:24:17,680 --> 03:24:39,760
Slowly taking care of this guy.

3355
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:41,260
Are you still alive?

3356
03:24:42,340 --> 03:24:42,819
I'm good.

3357
03:24:43,940 --> 03:24:48,940
I find you.

3358
03:24:51,069 --> 03:24:51,790
Oh shit.

3359
03:24:53,809 --> 03:24:58,260
What, this guy's dancing?

3360
03:25:02,940 --> 03:25:05,260
This guy's still getting hit by a lag.

3361
03:25:05,899 --> 03:25:08,450
How did you get him down there?

3362
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:09,729
You're a monster.

3363
03:25:20,590 --> 03:25:25,899
I think somebody just blew his ass in the game.

3364
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:29,899
I gotta get a bribe.

3365
03:25:31,040 --> 03:25:32,079
Just keep him distracted.

3366
03:25:32,879 --> 03:25:37,170
Just keep him distracted.

3367
03:25:37,889 --> 03:25:38,530
What?

3368
03:25:42,139 --> 03:25:42,639
Hey.

3369
03:25:43,340 --> 03:25:45,420
Hey, um, what do I mean?

3370
03:25:48,100 --> 03:25:49,459
It closed the helicopter.

3371
03:25:52,579 --> 03:25:56,959
I'm so bad.

3372
03:25:57,520 --> 03:25:59,780
What the fuck?

3373
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:01,459
Give me this whole toaster.

3374
03:26:01,459 --> 03:26:04,000
What the fuck?

3375
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:08,639
I'm so bad.

3376
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:09,520
What the fuck?

3377
03:26:09,520 --> 03:26:19,649
Give me this whole toaster.

3378
03:26:19,649 --> 03:26:21,340
What the fuck?

3379
03:26:21,340 --> 03:26:22,379
Give me this whole toaster.

3380
03:26:27,090 --> 03:26:34,239
Oh shit.

3381
03:26:36,590 --> 03:26:37,069
Come on.

3382
03:27:02,739 --> 03:27:04,500
That's the sound you want to hear in VR.

3383
03:27:05,459 --> 03:27:06,750
But where are you?

3384
03:27:13,809 --> 03:27:29,309
I can't get out of here.

3385
03:27:30,049 --> 03:27:31,010
I can't get out, guys.

3386
03:27:31,010 --> 03:27:31,729
I cannot leave.

3387
03:27:34,190 --> 03:27:35,469
Somebody just- okay.

3388
03:27:35,469 --> 03:27:36,989
All right, it's time to stand up.

3389
03:27:36,989 --> 03:27:37,709
It's time to stand up.

3390
03:27:37,709 --> 03:27:38,190
You know why?

3391
03:27:38,750 --> 03:27:40,590
Somebody just said 33-year-old.

3392
03:27:41,549 --> 03:27:42,670
I gotta get up.

3393
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:43,469
I have to stand up.

3394
03:27:45,229 --> 03:27:46,430
I gotta delete this VOD.

3395
03:27:47,229 --> 03:27:48,350
That's all you need to say.

3396
03:27:49,229 --> 03:27:51,760
All right, I'm getting up.

3397
03:27:51,760 --> 03:27:53,120
I have to delete the VOD.

3398
03:27:53,760 --> 03:27:55,280
I'm gonna delete this VOD, okay?

3399
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:59,680
What are you doing?

3400
03:28:00,829 --> 03:28:01,469
Me?

3401
03:28:01,469 --> 03:28:02,190
Am I alive?

3402
03:28:02,909 --> 03:28:03,149
What?

3403
03:28:03,149 --> 03:28:03,950
I thought I was dead.

3404
03:28:06,100 --> 03:28:07,700
Oh, now I'm in trouble.

3405
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:08,100
Quick, help.

3406
03:28:09,459 --> 03:28:12,930
I'm out.

3407
03:28:13,969 --> 03:28:20,180
That's not a real table.

3408
03:28:21,139 --> 03:28:21,860
Is he- where are you?

3409
03:28:21,860 --> 03:28:22,420
Are you gone?

3410
03:28:22,420 --> 03:28:22,920
You here?

3411
03:28:25,430 --> 03:28:25,930
Bye.

3412
03:28:25,930 --> 03:28:26,430
I left.

3413
03:28:29,620 --> 03:28:30,739
Totally wasted.

3414
03:28:34,280 --> 03:28:36,520
I think we all hear voices in our heads sometimes.

3415
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:44,469
Subverting expectations!

3416
03:28:57,750 --> 03:28:58,870
33-year-old.

3417
03:29:07,110 --> 03:29:13,940
The bartender won't serve you down there.

3418
03:29:13,940 --> 03:29:14,500
Maybe next time-

3419
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:16,340
All right, you ready to take a bus?

3420
03:29:17,059 --> 03:29:18,579
Yeah, let's get on the bus.

3421
03:29:18,579 --> 03:29:19,860
Let's get on the bus.

3422
03:29:20,020 --> 03:29:23,379
I could use a relaxing 8-hour drive to soothe my headache.

3423
03:29:28,100 --> 03:29:29,459
Only drink at rooftop bars.

3424
03:29:29,459 --> 03:29:30,579
Even if it's the dead of winter.

3425
03:30:03,729 --> 03:30:06,719
Okay, uh, you wanna take-

3426
03:30:06,719 --> 03:30:07,200
Oh, I gotta-

3427
03:30:10,309 --> 03:30:10,809
What?

3428
03:30:13,110 --> 03:30:14,149
You're gonna get on a bus?

3429
03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:17,139
Yeah, I'm launching it.

3430
03:30:17,139 --> 03:30:19,219
All right, how do I do it from my, like, home?

3431
03:30:19,219 --> 03:30:19,700
Studio?

3432
03:30:22,979 --> 03:30:23,940
I don't know.

3433
03:30:23,940 --> 03:30:24,739
Oh my god.

3434
03:30:33,860 --> 03:30:35,059
Oh god, it's so loud.

3435
03:30:37,110 --> 03:30:38,069
Click on it?

3436
03:30:38,069 --> 03:30:39,200
It's not up here.

3437
03:30:50,920 --> 03:30:51,959
Like, library?

3438
03:30:51,959 --> 03:30:56,290
No, no, where's my library?

3439
03:30:56,290 --> 03:31:01,170
Get out of this shit.

3440
03:31:12,239 --> 03:31:14,479
Open the Steam menu and go to the VR?

3441
03:31:14,479 --> 03:31:14,979
Yeah, yeah.

3442
03:31:15,840 --> 03:31:18,040
How do I get the fuck out of this?

3443
03:31:21,219 --> 03:31:21,719
Vive?

3444
03:31:22,340 --> 03:31:25,040
No, I don't know how to launch a Vive port.

3445
03:31:31,139 --> 03:31:31,860
Oh, my hands.

3446
03:31:32,420 --> 03:31:34,100
Oh, I gotta fucking put my face out of this.

3447
03:31:35,379 --> 03:31:36,180
Oh my god.

3448
03:31:38,079 --> 03:31:39,360
I gotta change the title anyways.

3449
03:31:49,750 --> 03:31:51,110
Desert bus-

3450
03:31:51,110 --> 03:31:53,430
I'm getting a chair if we're doing desert bus.

3451
03:31:53,430 --> 03:31:54,950
You don't stand and drive a bus.

3452
03:31:55,750 --> 03:31:56,709
I'm standing.

3453
03:31:56,709 --> 03:31:58,229
Are you standing for 8 hours?

3454
03:31:58,229 --> 03:31:58,950
You gonna do that?

3455
03:31:58,950 --> 03:31:59,270
Yeah.

3456
03:31:59,510 --> 03:32:00,709
You sure about that?

3457
03:32:00,709 --> 03:32:02,229
8 hours, I'll go back on the ground.

3458
03:32:04,040 --> 03:32:05,239
Yeah, stand for 8 hours.

3459
03:32:05,239 --> 03:32:08,200
It's a great idea.

3460
03:32:08,200 --> 03:32:09,799
Oh man, that's fucking funny.

3461
03:32:10,360 --> 03:32:17,700
All right, let's do it.

3462
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:18,819
I'm gonna load into-

3463
03:32:19,780 --> 03:32:24,209
Let me get a sip of my not-sponsored can of dry.

3464
03:32:24,209 --> 03:32:33,379
Go do this and get prepared.

3465
03:32:33,379 --> 03:32:34,100
Go use the bathroom.

3466
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:34,659
We'll switch off.

3467
03:32:36,079 --> 03:32:37,440
Funny time when you're on the bus.

3468
03:32:38,680 --> 03:32:41,489
Yeah, we'll be fine.

3469
03:32:41,489 --> 03:32:42,290
Pee before the trip.

3470
03:32:42,290 --> 03:32:47,360
We're gonna be fine.

3471
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:48,319
Okay, opening it up.

3472
03:32:48,319 --> 03:32:49,760
This is how easy this is to do.

3473
03:32:49,760 --> 03:32:52,950
I have no idea how to do a game.

3474
03:32:59,510 --> 03:33:01,110
I have to open the steam VR.

3475
03:33:01,110 --> 03:33:03,670
Launch desert bus directly in steam VR mode.

3476
03:33:04,870 --> 03:33:05,370
Okay.

3477
03:33:07,510 --> 03:33:08,229
I think it's working.

3478
03:33:09,620 --> 03:33:10,819
You look like you've been through hell.

3479
03:33:11,540 --> 03:33:13,299
Kind of have.

3480
03:33:14,120 --> 03:33:15,159
That's what it feels like.

3481
03:33:29,989 --> 03:33:33,110
Who knew that a fucking funny YouTuber game was gonna be so funny?

3482
03:33:34,790 --> 03:33:36,450
I'm gonna drop this volume.

3483
03:33:46,790 --> 03:33:52,149
So, people are saying that we need to go take a pee break,

3484
03:33:52,149 --> 03:33:52,870
but I don't believe them.

3485
03:33:52,870 --> 03:33:53,670
We can switch off.

3486
03:33:54,950 --> 03:33:55,430
I'm good.

3487
03:33:55,430 --> 03:33:56,069
I'm in the game.

3488
03:33:56,069 --> 03:33:56,870
You want to drive?

3489
03:33:56,870 --> 03:33:57,510
You want me to drive?

3490
03:34:00,309 --> 03:34:01,729
You can take first shift.

3491
03:34:01,729 --> 03:34:02,450
It's so filthy in here.

3492
03:34:03,170 --> 03:34:07,569
I don't know how to get together in a game, though.

3493
03:34:07,569 --> 03:34:08,049
Dude, hold on.

3494
03:34:08,049 --> 03:34:08,850
I gotta clean this.

3495
03:34:08,850 --> 03:34:11,409
It is filthy in there.

3496
03:34:12,129 --> 03:34:12,610
Filthy.

3497
03:34:13,170 --> 03:34:16,260
It's like, okay, somebody like came in my room

3498
03:34:16,260 --> 03:34:19,940
and put peanut butter in my vibe headset as a prank.

3499
03:34:20,899 --> 03:34:24,530
That's how ridiculous this looks.

3500
03:34:25,170 --> 03:34:31,120
This is sweat from sweat.

3501
03:34:31,120 --> 03:34:32,000
Yeah, I figured it out.

3502
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:33,280
I'm gonna throw in the fucking laundry.

3503
03:34:35,110 --> 03:34:36,309
Oh, man.

3504
03:34:36,309 --> 03:34:49,700
Did I buy a face pad yet?

3505
03:34:49,700 --> 03:34:50,579
Uh, not yet.

3506
03:34:51,379 --> 03:34:59,079
Hey, start.

3507
03:34:59,079 --> 03:35:01,639
Let me know when you need me to tell you what to do.

3508
03:35:01,639 --> 03:35:02,440
I just wanted you to know.

3509
03:35:03,159 --> 03:35:03,799
Oh, God.

3510
03:35:04,600 --> 03:35:06,450
It was very fun.

3511
03:35:07,250 --> 03:35:07,969
Hope you know that.

3512
03:35:07,969 --> 03:35:08,930
Before we get to Vegas.

3513
03:35:09,489 --> 03:35:11,879
All right, I got the wrong answer.

3514
03:35:16,530 --> 03:35:16,850
All right.

3515
03:35:19,840 --> 03:35:21,440
So, Tucson city limits.

3516
03:35:22,399 --> 03:35:25,059
So, how do we get this going?

3517
03:35:26,610 --> 03:35:29,889
Uh, the top right lever, pull that down,

3518
03:35:30,690 --> 03:35:31,809
and the card will come out.

3519
03:35:32,450 --> 03:35:33,729
And then you'll search for a game.

3520
03:35:34,930 --> 03:35:36,850
Okay, do I have to get any parameters

3521
03:35:36,850 --> 03:35:38,129
or can we join each other?

3522
03:35:38,129 --> 03:35:39,170
I have no idea.

3523
03:35:39,170 --> 03:35:39,809
I'm in a game.

3524
03:35:40,610 --> 03:35:42,129
You're in a game-found joining.

3525
03:35:43,010 --> 03:35:45,170
Okay, it's definitely mine.

3526
03:35:45,170 --> 03:35:45,489
Is it?

3527
03:35:47,729 --> 03:35:48,690
Oh, I can hear you.

3528
03:35:49,489 --> 03:35:53,219
I'm gonna turn off Discord probably.

3529
03:35:53,940 --> 03:36:03,889
Are you in here?

3530
03:36:04,770 --> 03:36:07,590
Hello?

3531
03:36:08,389 --> 03:36:11,600
Are these other people in here?

3532
03:36:12,319 --> 03:36:12,559
Yeah.

3533
03:36:13,440 --> 03:36:23,799
Um, can you come to the front?

3534
03:36:23,799 --> 03:36:25,079
I can't come to the front.

3535
03:36:25,079 --> 03:36:25,959
I'm all the way back here.

3536
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:27,959
You can't stand up?

3537
03:36:31,350 --> 03:36:35,829
No, because I, uh, I don't have a driver's license

3538
03:36:35,829 --> 03:36:37,510
and I have no idea how to do this.

3539
03:36:38,069 --> 03:36:39,030
Uh, we might have to...

3540
03:36:45,239 --> 03:36:46,760
Can we make, like, a separate game?

3541
03:36:47,559 --> 03:36:54,579
All right, here we go.

3542
03:36:55,219 --> 03:37:02,959
How do I...

3543
03:37:02,959 --> 03:37:03,200
Okay.

3544
03:37:09,639 --> 03:37:10,200
Oh, you can...

3545
03:37:10,200 --> 03:37:10,760
I can leave.

3546
03:37:12,469 --> 03:37:13,510
Why are you leaving?

3547
03:37:13,510 --> 03:37:14,149
Hey, you!

3548
03:37:14,149 --> 03:37:14,709
Hey, you!

3549
03:37:14,709 --> 03:37:16,149
How do I get up there?

3550
03:37:16,149 --> 03:37:20,690
Like, go like this?

3551
03:37:21,250 --> 03:37:39,059
I can't.

3552
03:37:39,700 --> 03:37:47,719
What the hell is this?

3553
03:37:48,610 --> 03:37:49,889
Are you driving the car?

3554
03:37:50,950 --> 03:37:51,670
Yeah.

3555
03:37:51,670 --> 03:38:00,959
He's just throwing something at me.

3556
03:38:03,350 --> 03:38:03,750
Teacher!

3557
03:38:04,739 --> 03:38:06,340
Teacher, he's throwing stuff at me!

3558
03:38:11,430 --> 03:38:12,950
You can't switch drivers.

3559
03:38:12,950 --> 03:38:16,950
Oh, I can't even walk back here.

3560
03:38:26,520 --> 03:38:32,520
Okay, um, this is it.

3561
03:38:39,729 --> 03:38:40,770
Turn on the radio.

3562
03:38:40,770 --> 03:38:41,489
Turn on the radio.

3563
03:39:02,159 --> 03:39:08,440
Sir, sir, this is not how you drive.

3564
03:39:08,440 --> 03:39:09,719
I'm gonna fall down in real life.

3565
03:39:10,280 --> 03:39:18,690
There's this thing that keeps making my controllers

3566
03:39:18,690 --> 03:39:20,770
vibrate, like, harder than I've ever felt.

3567
03:39:21,920 --> 03:39:22,959
It's concerning me.

3568
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:25,040
I don't know what this is.

3569
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:27,040
This is more of a dare than a game.

3570
03:39:27,040 --> 03:39:28,239
It's supposed to be terrible.

3571
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:36,040
Oh, no, no, no.

3572
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:39,840
Okay, you know what?

3573
03:39:39,840 --> 03:39:41,860
What?

3574
03:39:41,860 --> 03:39:43,219
Why do you have the police siren?

3575
03:39:43,219 --> 03:39:51,940
Uh, uh, I think we're getting towed.

3576
03:39:51,940 --> 03:39:54,079
What?

3577
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:57,559
What do you mean we're getting towed?

3578
03:39:59,399 --> 03:40:00,120
You're a...

3579
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:01,399
You're a toad!

3580
03:40:01,399 --> 03:40:12,520
You're not driving backwards right now?

3581
03:40:12,520 --> 03:40:13,319
I'm not driving...

3582
03:40:13,319 --> 03:40:14,840
No, we're getting towed backwards

3583
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:19,409
because I drove off the road.

3584
03:40:19,409 --> 03:40:21,010
Oh, my spleen just hurts.

3585
03:40:21,729 --> 03:40:24,930
And this is back to the beginning.

3586
03:40:24,930 --> 03:40:26,850
This tow truck is going like 90.

3587
03:40:27,729 --> 03:40:41,440
Can you at least put on music for us?

3588
03:40:42,399 --> 03:40:43,120
I left.

3589
03:40:44,799 --> 03:40:47,110
Here, you drive.

3590
03:40:47,909 --> 03:40:48,389
Me?

3591
03:40:48,389 --> 03:40:49,350
How is that possible?

3592
03:40:49,350 --> 03:40:49,989
How do I drive?

3593
03:40:50,549 --> 03:40:51,829
You have to get back to the menu.

3594
03:40:52,549 --> 03:40:52,870
Okay.

3595
03:40:53,750 --> 03:40:56,180
How do I pick drive car?

3596
03:40:58,899 --> 03:41:00,020
Uh, tell me when you're there.

3597
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:05,440
Oh, you take the time card out of the green box

3598
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:07,760
and you put it on top of the time card clock box,

3599
03:41:07,760 --> 03:41:08,399
the clock in.

3600
03:41:09,360 --> 03:41:12,440
You don't draw pictures.

3601
03:41:13,159 --> 03:41:17,329
Oh, the other card.

3602
03:41:17,329 --> 03:41:17,889
Doofus.

3603
03:41:18,530 --> 03:41:19,010
This one?

3604
03:41:19,649 --> 03:41:22,040
No, put it in the top of the green box.

3605
03:41:22,600 --> 03:41:26,520
This guy has never gone to work one day in his life.

3606
03:41:42,469 --> 03:41:42,969
Boo!

3607
03:41:44,290 --> 03:41:45,090
Are you coming in?

3608
03:41:46,450 --> 03:41:47,569
Wait, wait, wait.

3609
03:41:47,569 --> 03:41:48,959
Where are you?

3610
03:41:48,959 --> 03:41:49,520
Which one are you?

3611
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:51,120
I'm loading.

3612
03:41:55,639 --> 03:41:57,959
I'm three seats back right behind you.

3613
03:41:57,959 --> 03:41:58,520
Waving.

3614
03:41:58,520 --> 03:41:59,020
Hey!

3615
03:41:59,799 --> 03:42:00,299
Hey!

3616
03:42:01,409 --> 03:42:02,850
Okay, guys, be good.

3617
03:42:03,729 --> 03:42:09,620
Let's get a bit of radio station on here.

3618
03:42:09,620 --> 03:42:15,520
How do I change the radio?

3619
03:42:16,799 --> 03:42:20,370
Yeah, good luck with that.

3620
03:42:21,090 --> 03:42:32,770
How fast can you go?

3621
03:42:35,969 --> 03:42:36,770
About this fast.

3622
03:42:41,350 --> 03:42:43,989
Oh, that's you hitting the tires on the side.

3623
03:42:43,989 --> 03:42:44,469
What?

3624
03:42:44,469 --> 03:42:45,350
That's what that is.

3625
03:42:46,149 --> 03:43:04,180
What does this do?

3626
03:43:05,540 --> 03:43:10,719
What is this?

3627
03:43:10,719 --> 03:43:11,760
Is this the radio?

3628
03:43:11,760 --> 03:43:12,959
How do I change the station?

3629
03:43:18,389 --> 03:43:20,389
Get down from there, this instant!

3630
03:43:20,389 --> 03:43:23,440
Behind the yellow line.

3631
03:43:23,440 --> 03:43:29,540
You gotta tell your mother about that.

3632
03:43:29,540 --> 03:43:33,329
That's gonna be in my write-up.

3633
03:43:33,329 --> 03:43:34,129
Fucking asshole.

3634
03:43:34,770 --> 03:43:36,790
Just walk through the window.

3635
03:43:37,510 --> 03:43:38,799
All right, I'm out.

3636
03:43:46,870 --> 03:43:47,370
Already?

3637
03:43:48,309 --> 03:43:57,219
We did it in the last one minute.

3638
03:43:58,899 --> 03:43:59,459
No, we didn't.

3639
03:43:59,459 --> 03:44:00,500
We didn't last one minute.

3640
03:44:00,500 --> 03:44:02,420
I thought we'd at least be able to walk around the bus.

3641
03:44:03,299 --> 03:44:05,430
Yeah, it didn't last a minute.

3642
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:06,629
Sign in to restart state.

3643
03:44:06,629 --> 03:44:07,350
No, no, no.

3644
03:44:07,350 --> 03:44:08,149
That's not what we're doing.

3645
03:44:10,159 --> 03:44:11,120
You want to do table tennis?

3646
03:44:13,889 --> 03:44:15,329
Or are you like tapped out?

3647
03:44:18,000 --> 03:44:21,200
Let's do it because we're only going to do it for like five minutes anyway.

3648
03:44:21,200 --> 03:44:21,700
Probably.

3649
03:44:22,319 --> 03:44:27,889
I'm not sure how you can group with people.

3650
03:44:29,920 --> 03:44:31,569
I guess we'll have to find out.

3651
03:44:37,649 --> 03:44:38,850
Eight hour stream.

3652
03:44:39,569 --> 03:44:41,969
Oh yeah, that was a good eight hours in there.

3653
03:44:42,530 --> 03:44:45,360
Within the last fucking 15 seconds.

3654
03:44:46,000 --> 03:44:49,780
Is this game good?

3655
03:44:51,250 --> 03:44:51,889
Yeah.

3656
03:44:51,889 --> 03:44:52,930
Is it? Okay.

3657
03:44:52,930 --> 03:44:58,790
You need an entire dedicated weekend for Desert Bus.

3658
03:44:59,430 --> 03:45:04,610
Yeah, I can't believe we finished the whole thing either.

3659
03:45:04,610 --> 03:45:05,729
That was ridiculous.

3660
03:45:05,729 --> 03:45:06,850
We made it all the way to Vegas.

3661
03:45:07,409 --> 03:45:07,969
It's pretty cool.

3662
03:45:08,530 --> 03:45:10,360
All right, let's open it.

3663
03:45:10,360 --> 03:45:11,719
This is like squishing my eyes.

3664
03:45:12,520 --> 03:45:15,280
All right, this should be opening.

3665
03:45:23,829 --> 03:45:26,950
Drunken bar fight.

3666
03:45:26,950 --> 03:45:27,350
Killed me.

3667
03:45:30,870 --> 03:45:32,149
Joel beat Desert Bus?

3668
03:45:33,280 --> 03:45:33,680
He's good.

3669
03:45:34,319 --> 03:45:36,020
He's made out of steel.

3670
03:45:36,739 --> 03:45:42,579
Made out of incredible balls.

3671
03:45:44,389 --> 03:45:45,590
Why am I already fighting somebody?

3672
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:49,040
Who is this?

3673
03:45:49,600 --> 03:45:51,270
Is this tutorial?

3674
03:45:51,270 --> 03:45:52,069
I don't get it.

3675
03:45:52,069 --> 03:45:53,190
That's tutorial plot.

3676
03:45:55,399 --> 03:45:56,209
Okay.

3677
03:45:56,850 --> 03:45:58,549
This looks kind of good.

3678
03:45:58,549 --> 03:45:59,670
This looks like it could be a lot of fun.

3679
03:46:00,879 --> 03:46:04,799
It is actually very, very well physics simulation.

3680
03:46:04,799 --> 03:46:05,600
Very well good.

3681
03:46:06,319 --> 03:46:06,639
Okay.

3682
03:46:06,639 --> 03:46:07,920
If you press the menu button.

3683
03:46:08,559 --> 03:46:12,209
There should be a multiplayer.

3684
03:46:12,209 --> 03:46:13,569
I've never done the multiplayer.

3685
03:46:21,889 --> 03:46:23,729
You're going to have to go real easy on me, man.

3686
03:46:24,709 --> 03:46:26,309
Yeah, well, I'm trying to...

3687
03:46:27,030 --> 03:46:28,069
Are you Tommy Pickles?

3688
03:46:28,709 --> 03:46:29,030
Yes.

3689
03:46:29,750 --> 03:46:34,100
I sent you a challenge that I think shows up on your right.

3690
03:46:35,719 --> 03:46:36,360
It does.

3691
03:46:36,360 --> 03:46:37,159
How do I say yes?

3692
03:46:38,920 --> 03:46:39,719
I'm not sure.

3693
03:46:39,719 --> 03:46:40,280
Okay.

3694
03:46:40,280 --> 03:46:41,000
All right.

3695
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,959
Also, if you want it to, like if you go to your computer.

3696
03:46:43,959 --> 03:46:45,239
I'm not that tall.

3697
03:46:47,170 --> 03:46:47,729
I am.

3698
03:46:47,729 --> 03:46:48,930
Not that tall.

3699
03:46:49,569 --> 03:46:54,020
You're almost as tall as the top of the staircase.

3700
03:46:54,739 --> 03:46:56,049
This is my life.

3701
03:46:56,770 --> 03:46:59,110
All right.

3702
03:46:59,110 --> 03:46:59,909
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3703
03:46:59,909 --> 03:47:01,030
This is very important.

3704
03:47:01,030 --> 03:47:01,590
Okay.

3705
03:47:01,590 --> 03:47:02,149
Very important.

3706
03:47:02,149 --> 03:47:04,229
So you go back to the menu and go to settings.

3707
03:47:08,739 --> 03:47:09,139
Settings.

3708
03:47:10,579 --> 03:47:12,899
People are going to throw up if you use first person cam,

3709
03:47:12,899 --> 03:47:14,020
but you can like make it.

3710
03:47:15,920 --> 03:47:17,120
I don't know what the option is.

3711
03:47:18,559 --> 03:47:19,520
In game positioning.

3712
03:47:21,479 --> 03:47:23,319
Go to the eyeball, the top middle.

3713
03:47:23,319 --> 03:47:25,399
Do you have spectator camera?

3714
03:47:26,280 --> 03:47:27,879
Spectator camera.

3715
03:47:27,879 --> 03:47:28,120
Yeah.

3716
03:47:28,120 --> 03:47:29,319
The eyeball at the top middle.

3717
03:47:29,319 --> 03:47:29,959
Yeah.

3718
03:47:29,959 --> 03:47:31,719
So enable the spectator camera.

3719
03:47:32,520 --> 03:47:32,760
Yeah.

3720
03:47:33,319 --> 03:47:33,719
It's already on.

3721
03:47:33,719 --> 03:47:36,120
Because if you're in first person mode, people will throw up.

3722
03:47:36,120 --> 03:47:37,319
It's like 50 field of view.

3723
03:47:38,360 --> 03:47:38,760
Okay.

3724
03:47:38,760 --> 03:47:40,600
Well, enable spectator camera is checked.

3725
03:47:43,270 --> 03:47:44,469
It's definitely is first person.

3726
03:47:45,430 --> 03:47:46,149
Uncheck it?

3727
03:47:47,430 --> 03:47:48,069
How does this look?

3728
03:47:53,250 --> 03:47:54,370
Uncheck spectator?

3729
03:47:54,370 --> 03:47:54,690
All right.

3730
03:47:54,690 --> 03:47:54,850
No.

3731
03:47:55,969 --> 03:48:00,340
That's fine.

3732
03:48:00,899 --> 03:48:02,100
It looks all right.

3733
03:48:02,819 --> 03:48:11,489
Wait, how do you get the funny mask?

3734
03:48:12,719 --> 03:48:14,159
There's the funny mask option.

3735
03:48:14,159 --> 03:48:14,399
What?

3736
03:48:24,450 --> 03:48:27,719
Uh, yeah, I don't know how to change it because normally you can like

3737
03:48:27,719 --> 03:48:29,239
pull the camera to anywhere you want.

3738
03:48:29,239 --> 03:48:29,479
Whoops.

3739
03:48:29,479 --> 03:48:30,280
I hit my mic.

3740
03:48:30,280 --> 03:48:30,520
Yeah.

3741
03:48:30,520 --> 03:48:31,719
You smashed your mic.

3742
03:48:37,750 --> 03:48:38,149
All right.

3743
03:48:38,149 --> 03:48:39,829
I'm ready to just do a little volley here.

3744
03:48:40,549 --> 03:48:41,030
Hold on.

3745
03:48:41,030 --> 03:48:42,309
My sound is like zero.

3746
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:43,750
One second.

3747
03:48:51,430 --> 03:48:52,709
This does feel really good though.

3748
03:48:53,350 --> 03:49:02,950
You don't even need a ping pong table.

3749
03:49:02,950 --> 03:49:04,229
Just return the one that you bought.

3750
03:49:19,379 --> 03:49:20,180
Oh, yeah.

3751
03:49:21,139 --> 03:49:21,940
Oh, yeah.

3752
03:49:24,360 --> 03:49:24,840
Ah!

3753
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:39,139
I didn't even tell me I was getting that close.

3754
03:49:39,139 --> 03:49:39,780
That was bad.

3755
03:49:39,780 --> 03:49:40,819
That was like breaks up.

3756
03:49:40,819 --> 03:49:44,180
You can move the table around with the left hand trigger.

3757
03:49:44,180 --> 03:49:45,700
You can like adjust where you are.

3758
03:49:45,700 --> 03:49:46,420
Is this all right?

3759
03:49:51,459 --> 03:49:53,139
Oh, that was the worst one yet.

3760
03:49:53,139 --> 03:49:54,500
That was the absolute worst one.

3761
03:49:54,500 --> 03:49:56,579
That was like I'm trying to break this controller in half.

3762
03:49:58,579 --> 03:49:58,739
Yeah.

3763
03:49:58,739 --> 03:49:59,379
How do I kick this?

3764
03:49:59,379 --> 03:50:01,780
Look, I'm like, look at how far away from the table I am.

3765
03:50:01,780 --> 03:50:02,340
How do I do that?

3766
03:50:03,700 --> 03:50:06,899
Uh, I don't know because your controller is different.

3767
03:50:06,899 --> 03:50:08,100
Left hand trigger.

3768
03:50:08,899 --> 03:50:10,850
You hold and you can move the table.

3769
03:50:11,729 --> 03:50:12,930
You can be like a tiny boy.

3770
03:50:13,729 --> 03:50:20,639
Because like here, I'm too close.

3771
03:50:27,520 --> 03:50:28,399
Right hand trigger.

3772
03:50:29,969 --> 03:50:30,690
Left.

3773
03:50:30,690 --> 03:50:31,889
Remember what I'm saying?

3774
03:50:31,889 --> 03:50:32,129
Right.

3775
03:50:32,850 --> 03:50:34,610
There's a dent in the wall.

3776
03:50:34,610 --> 03:50:35,409
Shut the fuck up.

3777
03:50:35,409 --> 03:50:36,129
Don't tell me that.

3778
03:50:36,770 --> 03:50:50,469
It's a fucking like new desk too.

3779
03:50:53,760 --> 03:50:56,159
Oh, I can see where I fucking made a problem here.

3780
03:50:56,959 --> 03:50:58,790
I like chipped it.

3781
03:50:59,590 --> 03:51:02,049
Your controller?

3782
03:51:02,049 --> 03:51:03,010
Oh, okay.

3783
03:51:03,010 --> 03:51:05,170
I see what you're talking about for Spectator Cam.

3784
03:51:05,170 --> 03:51:07,170
Nah, it's not doing that because I have OpenVR.

3785
03:51:08,049 --> 03:51:09,750
I see what you mean though.

3786
03:51:15,139 --> 03:51:15,459
Do you?

3787
03:51:16,500 --> 03:51:18,739
Yeah, because when I take my headset off, I can see it.

3788
03:51:19,540 --> 03:51:30,549
But I need to figure out how to get this not the way to set OBS to the game capture.

3789
03:51:32,770 --> 03:51:34,129
I could just pull it, can't I?

3790
03:51:34,129 --> 03:51:34,610
Yeah.

3791
03:51:34,610 --> 03:51:35,969
Let me just do that real quick.

3792
03:51:35,969 --> 03:51:42,209
Because it creates, yeah, the screen on your monitor is the drag around camera.

3793
03:51:43,010 --> 03:51:43,729
Let's see.

3794
03:51:45,010 --> 03:51:46,559
Is that it?

3795
03:51:49,750 --> 03:51:50,149
There it is.

3796
03:51:50,709 --> 03:51:51,940
There it is.

3797
03:51:59,479 --> 03:52:02,200
But the problem is I need to pull this table closer.

3798
03:52:03,079 --> 03:52:06,879
It should be one of your triggers to move the table.

3799
03:52:06,879 --> 03:52:07,600
I've done them both.

3800
03:52:08,319 --> 03:52:09,920
Do I have to physically grab the table?

3801
03:52:12,530 --> 03:52:12,850
No.

3802
03:52:12,850 --> 03:52:15,969
Anywhere you push, everything turns white and you can move the table.

3803
03:52:16,850 --> 03:52:20,149
For me, it's underneath trigger on the left hand.

3804
03:52:20,790 --> 03:52:24,450
See, when I press that, I get the ball and then I have menu.

3805
03:52:24,450 --> 03:52:30,229
Oh, do the Vive controllers have two triggers?

3806
03:52:30,229 --> 03:52:31,670
I have like the buttons.

3807
03:52:31,670 --> 03:52:33,430
But like looking at your hand, what does it say?

3808
03:52:34,389 --> 03:52:35,190
Menu ball.

3809
03:52:36,229 --> 03:52:40,290
Oh, mine has a hold to reposition thing.

3810
03:52:41,090 --> 03:52:42,690
Can you move it for me?

3811
03:52:43,799 --> 03:52:44,040
No.

3812
03:52:48,639 --> 03:52:49,280
Change back.

3813
03:52:50,850 --> 03:52:51,649
Switch back.

3814
03:52:51,649 --> 03:52:52,370
Change back.

3815
03:52:54,610 --> 03:52:55,489
What's wrong with this?

3816
03:52:56,129 --> 03:53:02,979
It's on the right hand.

3817
03:53:02,979 --> 03:53:04,020
Okay, right hand trigger.

3818
03:53:04,659 --> 03:53:05,620
Not doing anything.

3819
03:53:05,620 --> 03:53:06,579
Right hand grip.

3820
03:53:06,579 --> 03:53:07,379
Doesn't do anything.

3821
03:53:07,379 --> 03:53:08,819
Right hand button.

3822
03:53:08,819 --> 03:53:09,540
Not doing anything.

3823
03:53:10,260 --> 03:53:10,739
Grips.

3824
03:53:11,379 --> 03:53:11,860
Triggers.

3825
03:53:12,420 --> 03:53:13,139
Both triggers.

3826
03:53:14,319 --> 03:53:14,719
Pads.

3827
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:16,319
Haptic.

3828
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:19,760
Where is this?

3829
03:53:20,399 --> 03:53:27,159
Maybe it's in the settings.

3830
03:53:27,159 --> 03:53:27,479
Room.

3831
03:53:28,200 --> 03:53:29,399
Challenger.

3832
03:53:29,399 --> 03:53:31,399
What does your right hand trigger do?

3833
03:53:32,120 --> 03:53:33,799
Uh, anything?

3834
03:53:33,799 --> 03:53:34,280
Hold on.

3835
03:53:36,309 --> 03:53:36,870
Studio.

3836
03:53:37,590 --> 03:53:45,620
In game positioning?

3837
03:53:45,620 --> 03:53:47,139
Maybe that's what it is and I don't check it.

3838
03:53:47,780 --> 03:53:50,959
Let's just see what happens.

3839
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:52,799
Maybe I have that checked.

3840
03:53:57,239 --> 03:53:58,200
Okay, there we go.

3841
03:53:58,200 --> 03:53:58,840
So it's this.

3842
03:54:03,750 --> 03:54:04,069
There we go.

3843
03:54:04,069 --> 03:54:04,549
That's my...

3844
03:54:04,549 --> 03:54:06,069
Okay, that's a thousand times better.

3845
03:54:06,870 --> 03:54:10,690
I think it wasn't selected somehow.

3846
03:54:10,690 --> 03:54:11,409
All right, I'm ready.

3847
03:54:11,409 --> 03:54:13,090
How close am I to the fucking...

3848
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:15,319
Okay, I'm good.

3849
03:54:16,200 --> 03:54:17,000
Actually, I need...

3850
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:17,719
All right, I'm good.

3851
03:54:17,719 --> 03:54:18,680
What is happening with my...

3852
03:54:18,680 --> 03:54:19,639
I'm so tangled up.

3853
03:54:20,680 --> 03:54:21,879
Look at this bullshit, guys.

3854
03:54:44,479 --> 03:54:46,879
I'm just seeing a cat head spinning circles.

3855
03:54:49,540 --> 03:54:50,819
I probably shouldn't be doing this,

3856
03:54:51,799 --> 03:54:54,040
but I have enough strength to be able to do it, I think.

3857
03:54:54,920 --> 03:55:02,399
All right, that made it better?

3858
03:55:03,440 --> 03:55:04,000
Or worse?

3859
03:55:04,719 --> 03:55:08,100
No clue.

3860
03:55:08,100 --> 03:55:10,069
It's a mess down here.

3861
03:55:10,709 --> 03:55:12,680
Wait, hold on.

3862
03:55:17,520 --> 03:55:18,239
All right, fuck it.

3863
03:55:18,239 --> 03:55:19,040
Let's go.

3864
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:19,540
Ready?

3865
03:55:20,159 --> 03:55:20,639
Ready?

3866
03:55:20,639 --> 03:55:21,120
I'm ready.

3867
03:55:26,370 --> 03:55:27,329
You win.

3868
03:55:27,329 --> 03:55:28,260
That was it.

3869
03:55:28,979 --> 03:55:29,459
I won.

3870
03:55:30,020 --> 03:55:31,190
That's the whole thing.

3871
03:55:40,389 --> 03:55:44,469
Oh, boy.

3872
03:55:44,469 --> 03:55:49,840
It's really weird without sound.

3873
03:55:51,510 --> 03:55:52,469
Why are you not playing with sound?

3874
03:55:53,110 --> 03:55:53,510
I don't know.

3875
03:55:53,510 --> 03:55:54,309
I can't get it to work.

3876
03:55:54,870 --> 03:56:04,659
Yeah.

3877
03:56:04,659 --> 03:56:11,170
Damn it.

3878
03:56:11,170 --> 03:56:16,260
It's in the game.

3879
03:56:16,260 --> 03:56:18,100
I just thought about the drunken fight game.

3880
03:56:20,479 --> 03:56:22,639
Damn it.

3881
03:56:22,639 --> 03:56:25,920
It's in the game.

3882
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:32,659
Oh my.

3883
03:56:32,659 --> 03:56:34,420
Is that from the ceiling like that?

3884
03:56:34,420 --> 03:56:36,200
Mine's like fucked up here, too.

3885
03:56:36,840 --> 03:56:38,639
All right, let's do a ranked match.

3886
03:56:38,639 --> 03:56:39,040
You and me.

3887
03:56:40,040 --> 03:56:40,920
Ranked.

3888
03:56:40,920 --> 03:56:42,000
How do I ready?

3889
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:44,399
What did you do on the left side?

3890
03:56:44,399 --> 03:56:44,799
Ranked.

3891
03:56:45,360 --> 03:56:47,360
Let me try one more time to get my sound to work.

3892
03:56:52,309 --> 03:56:53,829
Jeremy has a weak backhand.

3893
03:56:54,469 --> 03:56:57,520
I've got a weak every hand.

3894
03:57:01,379 --> 03:57:02,180
First person.

3895
03:57:02,180 --> 03:57:03,700
Put the first person cam back on.

3896
03:57:04,260 --> 03:57:06,520
See, everyone wants the first person cam, man.

3897
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:09,319
They don't like this like weird spectator mode.

3898
03:57:10,959 --> 03:57:11,920
All right, I'm okay.

3899
03:57:11,920 --> 03:57:12,959
All right, fine.

3900
03:57:12,959 --> 03:57:14,079
If they want to vomit.

3901
03:57:14,879 --> 03:57:16,229
I got you, guys.

3902
03:57:16,229 --> 03:57:16,549
Don't worry.

3903
03:57:20,579 --> 03:57:21,299
I wasn't even...

3904
03:57:21,940 --> 03:57:22,579
I tried to...

3905
03:57:24,629 --> 03:57:25,430
Yeah, see, you're gonna...

3906
03:57:25,430 --> 03:57:26,629
I keep wanting to touch the table.

3907
03:57:26,629 --> 03:57:27,829
That's not how it works, Jeremy.

3908
03:57:27,829 --> 03:57:31,670
Everyone's doing vomit emotes.

3909
03:57:31,670 --> 03:57:32,389
You asked for this.

3910
03:57:33,920 --> 03:57:34,559
All right, I'm ready.

3911
03:57:36,739 --> 03:57:38,600
I don't know how to ready.

3912
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:39,799
To the left of the table is a...

3913
03:57:39,799 --> 03:57:40,840
It says ranked and unranked.

3914
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:41,959
Oh, okay, I got it.

3915
03:57:41,959 --> 03:57:42,840
Game one, ranked.

3916
03:57:46,520 --> 03:57:47,000
Here, sir.

3917
03:57:47,719 --> 03:57:55,510
Okay.

3918
03:58:01,170 --> 03:58:01,409
Okay.

3919
03:58:07,670 --> 03:58:07,989
Thank you.

3920
03:58:13,959 --> 03:58:14,600
Here, sir.

3921
03:58:17,780 --> 03:58:23,489
God damn it.

3922
03:58:24,290 --> 03:58:26,479
Here, here we go.

3923
03:58:27,200 --> 03:58:29,510
Whoops.

3924
03:58:32,500 --> 03:58:32,819
What?

3925
03:58:34,069 --> 03:58:35,270
Oh, that was bullshit.

3926
03:58:35,829 --> 03:58:36,149
You know what?

3927
03:58:36,149 --> 03:58:36,950
You couldn't get that?

3928
03:58:38,389 --> 03:58:45,350
That's a fault?

3929
03:58:47,030 --> 03:58:48,629
You can't throw the ball over

3930
03:58:50,979 --> 03:58:52,100
the line of the table and you still...

3931
03:58:52,100 --> 03:58:52,340
No.

3932
03:58:55,090 --> 03:59:05,510
Come on, let me get the 30% on you.

3933
03:59:07,670 --> 03:59:08,790
What the fuck did I do?

3934
03:59:09,590 --> 03:59:09,829
What?

3935
03:59:09,829 --> 03:59:11,270
I can't cross the line, bro.

3936
03:59:14,180 --> 03:59:16,100
I can turn that off, actually.

3937
03:59:16,659 --> 03:59:17,139
All right, I'm...

3938
03:59:19,879 --> 03:59:21,559
I got no awareness here.

3939
03:59:21,559 --> 03:59:23,079
Turned it off.

3940
03:59:23,079 --> 03:59:27,989
This is gonna be tighter.

3941
03:59:27,989 --> 03:59:32,450
You ready?

3942
03:59:32,450 --> 03:59:32,930
I'm ready.

3943
03:59:41,299 --> 03:59:43,139
This really is the most dangerous game.

3944
03:59:43,780 --> 03:59:47,379
I've hit the wall more times.

3945
03:59:47,379 --> 03:59:50,260
I've done VR streams like eight times.

3946
03:59:50,260 --> 03:59:50,819
Oh, God.

3947
03:59:51,459 --> 03:59:52,659
Oh, my chair's behind me.

3948
04:00:07,520 --> 04:00:07,840
Hit it.

3949
04:00:15,379 --> 04:00:16,899
I fucking ate myself.

3950
04:00:18,579 --> 04:00:19,379
That's the worst too.

3951
04:00:19,379 --> 04:00:20,260
I didn't mean to.

3952
04:00:20,260 --> 04:00:21,700
If you hit anything to the corners

3953
04:00:21,700 --> 04:00:23,459
then it's like my wall's right here.

3954
04:00:23,459 --> 04:00:25,459
How do you do like the fucking curve?

3955
04:00:25,459 --> 04:00:26,340
What do I do?

3956
04:00:26,340 --> 04:00:29,319
So you go like...

3957
04:00:33,399 --> 04:00:33,639
No.

3958
04:00:34,200 --> 04:00:37,989
I got it.

3959
04:00:37,989 --> 04:00:38,229
No.

3960
04:00:41,430 --> 04:00:42,469
You got it.

3961
04:00:42,469 --> 04:00:49,920
You're getting it.

3962
04:00:50,559 --> 04:00:54,319
I don't know how to do it, okay?

3963
04:00:54,319 --> 04:00:58,899
That was your fault.

3964
04:00:58,899 --> 04:01:02,770
Whoops.

3965
04:01:02,770 --> 04:01:03,489
No, I see what you're doing.

3966
04:01:03,729 --> 04:01:04,930
You're doing like you're pancakeing it.

3967
04:01:06,049 --> 04:01:07,329
You got a pancake.

3968
04:01:07,329 --> 04:01:10,920
What was it on that?

3969
04:01:10,920 --> 04:01:12,579
It never hit your side.

3970
04:01:21,829 --> 04:01:30,020
Hey, by the way, your apartment sucks.

3971
04:01:30,020 --> 04:01:32,850
White brick, dirty windows.

3972
04:01:33,920 --> 04:01:35,120
What does that go?

3973
04:01:35,120 --> 04:01:36,559
Why do you have a staircase there?

3974
04:01:36,559 --> 04:01:37,360
But what is up there?

3975
04:01:38,319 --> 04:01:39,360
Your locker is up there?

3976
04:01:40,760 --> 04:01:41,559
No, no, no, no, no.

3977
04:01:41,559 --> 04:01:43,079
You got a lot of shit to talk.

3978
04:01:43,079 --> 04:01:45,079
You haven't even seen my basement.

3979
04:01:45,079 --> 04:01:49,110
Had to come down here

3980
04:01:49,110 --> 04:01:51,510
when I have some philosophical quandaries

3981
04:01:51,510 --> 04:01:53,510
about how much taller I am than you.

3982
04:01:55,590 --> 04:01:56,950
Sometimes I just like to, you know,

3983
04:01:56,950 --> 04:01:59,430
just wonder how could one person be that short?

3984
04:02:00,229 --> 04:02:01,430
We just surf from up here.

3985
04:02:11,479 --> 04:02:12,520
I couldn't get down.

3986
04:02:19,090 --> 04:02:20,129
Get a little taller.

3987
04:02:20,770 --> 04:02:21,569
A little bit taller.

3988
04:02:22,549 --> 04:02:23,350
Every point I get.

3989
04:02:33,270 --> 04:02:35,399
Wow.

3990
04:02:35,399 --> 04:02:37,079
Rating zero to 16.

3991
04:02:37,079 --> 04:02:37,399
Cool.

3992
04:02:38,120 --> 04:02:43,000
Dude, I'm going to be ranked 10 million soon.

3993
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:47,780
I tried to watch the replay.

3994
04:02:49,670 --> 04:02:50,870
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3995
04:02:50,870 --> 04:02:52,290
Does it record voices too?

3996
04:02:53,700 --> 04:02:54,979
I don't think so.

3997
04:02:54,979 --> 04:02:57,670
Oh, how do we?

3998
04:02:57,670 --> 04:03:05,399
All right, let's go again.

3999
04:03:05,399 --> 04:03:05,899
Ready?

4000
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:13,299
All right, surf.

4001
04:03:13,299 --> 04:03:13,799
Rank it up.

4002
04:03:14,420 --> 04:03:18,930
Here's your surf, I think.

4003
04:03:30,559 --> 04:03:31,059
Okay.

4004
04:03:34,950 --> 04:03:35,590
Okay.

4005
04:03:35,590 --> 04:03:41,319
Pick out these million dollar pieces.

4006
04:03:41,319 --> 04:03:42,520
Where do you get that from?

4007
04:03:42,520 --> 04:03:43,479
King touch tomb.

4008
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:45,799
Please don't look at it.

4009
04:03:45,799 --> 04:03:47,239
It gets older when you look at it.

4010
04:03:59,059 --> 04:04:00,020
Just nice and easy.

4011
04:04:01,379 --> 04:04:02,180
Nice and easy.

4012
04:04:02,180 --> 04:04:02,979
You don't understand.

4013
04:04:02,979 --> 04:04:03,540
He plays.

4014
04:04:04,260 --> 04:04:07,059
He plays like professional table tennis.

4015
04:04:07,620 --> 04:04:12,950
You know, you just start making things up just so you don't look bad.

4016
04:04:14,079 --> 04:04:15,280
Oh, what did that happen?

4017
04:04:16,000 --> 04:04:33,059
I think the five controls have these big balloon heads.

4018
04:04:33,700 --> 04:04:36,870
You know, just got to start making things up.

4019
04:04:37,510 --> 04:04:39,680
Why am I just trying to catch that in my groin?

4020
04:04:39,680 --> 04:04:57,750
It was like, what's the fucking like glass I can throw at you?

4021
04:04:58,549 --> 04:05:15,430
Nice try, but you didn't get it.

4022
04:05:20,079 --> 04:05:20,799
What the hell was that?

4023
04:05:20,799 --> 04:05:21,920
Like whipple ball bullshit.

4024
04:05:22,559 --> 04:05:23,680
Whipple ball bullshit?

4025
04:05:24,399 --> 04:05:32,579
Come over here, table.

4026
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:40,950
That's just the I'm done.

4027
04:05:41,909 --> 04:05:42,709
I'm done.

4028
04:05:42,709 --> 04:05:43,209
I'm good.

4029
04:05:45,489 --> 04:05:47,940
That was my mic.

4030
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:52,559
You got me.

4031
04:05:54,879 --> 04:05:56,159
Yeah, that's okay.

4032
04:05:56,159 --> 04:05:58,639
VR, when you play with a friend, you're just playing battleship.

4033
04:05:59,680 --> 04:06:01,120
Like you bumped into the wall.

4034
04:06:01,120 --> 04:06:02,479
Like that's C2.

4035
04:06:02,479 --> 04:06:03,120
I get a point.

4036
04:06:06,659 --> 04:06:09,540
I got to come into your room and put like chairs and shit in the way.

4037
04:06:09,540 --> 04:06:10,819
And you have to do it to my room.

4038
04:06:10,899 --> 04:06:11,780
VR battleship.

4039
04:06:12,579 --> 04:06:13,860
Take this chair out of the way.

4040
04:06:13,860 --> 04:06:14,899
I never have it here.

4041
04:06:19,670 --> 04:06:20,629
Why didn't you return it?

4042
04:06:20,629 --> 04:06:23,569
Did the people say that was a bad joke?

4043
04:06:25,750 --> 04:06:26,469
I'm going to name it what?

4044
04:06:27,110 --> 04:06:27,750
How dare you?

4045
04:06:28,549 --> 04:06:36,280
Seven to six, I'm still winning.

4046
04:06:36,840 --> 04:06:39,719
If we're playing beer hockey, what's it called?

4047
04:06:39,719 --> 04:06:41,000
Oh my god, you were.

4048
04:06:41,000 --> 04:06:41,559
Air hockey.

4049
04:06:41,559 --> 04:06:47,569
If we're playing air hockey, I want to do 11.

4050
04:06:48,659 --> 04:06:50,340
Yeah, name of the game.

4051
04:06:51,959 --> 04:06:53,959
The name of the game is ping pong, actually.

4052
04:06:55,989 --> 04:06:58,790
Actually, name of this game is 11, table tennis.

4053
04:06:58,790 --> 04:07:00,389
The name of this game is ping pong.

4054
04:07:00,950 --> 04:07:05,079
Double nine.

4055
04:07:11,729 --> 04:07:13,010
Come on, you stupid game.

4056
04:07:13,010 --> 04:07:13,649
I'm not worried.

4057
04:07:31,520 --> 04:07:33,520
Your name here versus stir.

4058
04:07:34,659 --> 04:07:36,100
Yeah, they think that's the one.

4059
04:07:38,209 --> 04:07:38,690
All right, hold on.

4060
04:07:38,690 --> 04:07:39,489
I'm watching something.

4061
04:07:39,489 --> 04:07:39,969
Is this?

4062
04:07:39,969 --> 04:07:40,690
I got to get out of the way.

4063
04:07:43,510 --> 04:07:44,069
Who's who?

4064
04:07:44,629 --> 04:07:49,139
This is not the whole replay.

4065
04:07:57,280 --> 04:07:58,799
What part of the replay are we watching?

4066
04:08:08,479 --> 04:08:10,159
I always do like the pancake.

4067
04:08:22,850 --> 04:08:23,889
I got a shit.

4068
04:08:24,850 --> 04:08:35,510
Oh, was that when he hit his hand?

4069
04:08:35,510 --> 04:08:36,389
When does he hit his hand?

4070
04:08:36,950 --> 04:08:39,430
Oh, no.

4071
04:08:40,309 --> 04:08:52,840
All right, you know something I'm noticing right now?

4072
04:08:53,399 --> 04:08:56,840
Look at how much I'm talking and gesturing with my fucking hands.

4073
04:08:58,579 --> 04:09:00,739
You really are a moody Susan.

4074
04:09:00,739 --> 04:09:01,860
I'm like, let me tell you something.

4075
04:09:04,500 --> 04:09:05,620
Do I do this?

4076
04:09:06,680 --> 04:09:06,920
Yeah.

4077
04:09:07,719 --> 04:09:09,639
Like, look at over there.

4078
04:09:09,639 --> 04:09:11,860
He just is a person.

4079
04:09:12,500 --> 04:09:14,579
I'm like a cartoon character.

4080
04:09:15,700 --> 04:09:27,909
Hold on, stop, stop.

4081
04:09:27,909 --> 04:09:29,190
Oh, don't yell at me.

4082
04:09:40,629 --> 04:09:42,229
Look at the amount of movement over here.

4083
04:09:43,510 --> 04:09:45,829
I'm going to do this at like time's fucking five speed.

4084
04:09:45,829 --> 04:09:47,829
Just look at the movement on this side of the table.

4085
04:09:48,549 --> 04:09:50,760
This person's being electrocuted.

4086
04:09:50,760 --> 04:09:51,799
This person's just hanging out.

4087
04:09:55,639 --> 04:09:56,040
Yeah.

4088
04:09:56,040 --> 04:09:56,680
Do you understand?

4089
04:09:56,680 --> 04:09:58,120
Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?

4090
04:10:02,500 --> 04:10:03,139
Oh, my God.

4091
04:10:03,139 --> 04:10:04,659
All right, let's do one more.

4092
04:10:04,659 --> 04:10:05,719
How do I get out of here?

4093
04:10:05,719 --> 04:10:06,680
Do I have to invite you again?

4094
04:10:11,010 --> 04:10:12,530
No, I'm the tallest one.

4095
04:10:15,200 --> 04:10:16,159
All right, let me get out of here.

4096
04:10:21,430 --> 04:10:23,350
All right, back to main menu.

4097
04:10:23,350 --> 04:10:24,389
I'm trying to scratch my nose.

4098
04:10:24,389 --> 04:10:25,270
What is minigames?

4099
04:10:27,620 --> 04:10:31,860
Um, it has a simulated ping pong robot.

4100
04:10:31,860 --> 04:10:32,420
Oh.

4101
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:34,100
And different challenges you can do with it.

4102
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:43,639
There's nothing wrong with being an animated talker man.

4103
04:10:45,280 --> 04:10:46,399
All right, you got to throw me an invite.

4104
04:10:47,430 --> 04:10:48,149
I'm looking.

4105
04:10:48,870 --> 04:10:51,670
Can we go to one of the other expensive rooms in your house?

4106
04:10:52,979 --> 04:10:54,659
Yeah, it says you're idle.

4107
04:10:55,459 --> 04:10:55,780
Idle?

4108
04:10:57,489 --> 04:10:58,370
How about now?

4109
04:10:58,370 --> 04:11:11,360
I don't know why I can't invite you.

4110
04:11:12,469 --> 04:11:14,149
If you go to multiplayer,

4111
04:11:15,030 --> 04:11:17,350
and you should be able to scroll and find my name.

4112
04:11:17,350 --> 04:11:19,190
Tommy Pickles uses online.

4113
04:11:22,309 --> 04:11:24,629
All right, hold on.

4114
04:11:24,629 --> 04:11:25,110
Itchy nose.

4115
04:11:30,129 --> 04:11:37,159
All right, loading my roof.

4116
04:11:37,719 --> 04:11:39,750
Oh, Jesus.

4117
04:11:40,469 --> 04:11:41,680
This is bizarre.

4118
04:11:46,229 --> 04:11:48,069
I don't like it, though, because the ball is white,

4119
04:11:48,069 --> 04:11:49,430
and so is the background.

4120
04:11:49,430 --> 04:11:50,709
There's only two good levels.

4121
04:11:51,590 --> 04:11:53,510
The other one's like a winter one,

4122
04:11:53,510 --> 04:11:55,190
and it also is like really blue.

4123
04:11:55,909 --> 04:11:58,719
Oh, this is nice.

4124
04:11:59,280 --> 04:12:01,600
This is like whoever loses, the vultures get you.

4125
04:12:02,770 --> 04:12:03,409
Las Vegas.

4126
04:12:08,260 --> 04:12:09,780
You're going to have to find like a better friend,

4127
04:12:11,139 --> 04:12:14,659
because like I'm like a bad player, a friend player.

4128
04:12:19,250 --> 04:12:23,760
Hold on.

4129
04:12:23,760 --> 04:12:24,319
Same spot.

4130
04:12:33,200 --> 04:12:34,079
Shit.

4131
04:12:34,079 --> 04:12:37,010
If you got that, I would have I would have S'd your D.

4132
04:12:42,129 --> 04:12:43,329
Wouldn't be as animated as you,

4133
04:12:43,329 --> 04:12:44,530
so you don't feel bad afterwards.

4134
04:12:45,409 --> 04:12:48,389
Oh, speaking of vultures, there they are.

4135
04:12:48,389 --> 04:12:49,430
A lot of them.

4136
04:12:49,430 --> 04:12:54,709
This level is kind of laggy.

4137
04:12:55,430 --> 04:12:57,750
You getting any laggy here?

4138
04:12:57,750 --> 04:12:58,309
No, that's fine.

4139
04:12:59,989 --> 04:13:00,469
Little deal.

4140
04:13:01,840 --> 04:13:02,879
Actually, I am getting it.

4141
04:13:02,879 --> 04:13:03,680
I'm switching.

4142
04:13:03,680 --> 04:13:04,719
That was really bad.

4143
04:13:07,139 --> 04:13:08,500
You should see the part of the controller here.

4144
04:13:08,500 --> 04:13:09,379
I'll show it on camera.

4145
04:13:10,020 --> 04:13:17,780
All right, give me some tips.

4146
04:13:18,340 --> 04:13:20,180
How do I stop doing like the under pancake?

4147
04:13:22,899 --> 04:13:24,020
Every time a ball comes, I go.

4148
04:13:25,059 --> 04:13:28,920
It's really hard to tell what you're doing

4149
04:13:28,920 --> 04:13:30,040
without seeing your arms.

4150
04:13:32,479 --> 04:13:33,600
Just watch my stream.

4151
04:13:34,399 --> 04:13:36,079
Just turn on my stream.

4152
04:13:36,639 --> 04:13:38,079
Do you really think you're going to learn anything?

4153
04:13:41,040 --> 04:13:43,920
Just get like VR window and open up my stream

4154
04:13:43,920 --> 04:13:44,639
while you stream.

4155
04:13:45,200 --> 04:13:47,360
Oh wait, you're not streaming.

4156
04:13:47,920 --> 04:13:51,489
Well, technically you are.

4157
04:13:52,129 --> 04:13:57,520
Technically, we're all streaming.

4158
04:13:57,520 --> 04:13:58,239
Two to six.

4159
04:13:58,799 --> 04:14:02,340
I caught it.

4160
04:14:02,340 --> 04:14:03,379
It doesn't count.

4161
04:14:03,379 --> 04:14:06,520
Whoops.

4162
04:14:06,520 --> 04:14:11,680
Like how do you do that?

4163
04:14:12,559 --> 04:14:13,280
That like-

4164
04:14:13,280 --> 04:14:13,840
Just hit it.

4165
04:14:16,879 --> 04:14:18,559
You're like charging up an EX move.

4166
04:14:18,559 --> 04:14:19,680
I can like see you doing it.

4167
04:14:20,319 --> 04:14:20,819
You go like-

4168
04:14:20,819 --> 04:14:21,299
What?

4169
04:14:21,299 --> 04:14:21,860
You go like-

4170
04:14:22,420 --> 04:14:26,950
Cause you gotta, you gotta do it.

4171
04:14:29,120 --> 04:14:30,479
I can't explain it to you over the internet.

4172
04:14:30,479 --> 04:14:31,840
You have a fighting game tell

4173
04:14:31,840 --> 04:14:32,799
when you're going to do that.

4174
04:14:33,520 --> 04:14:34,639
I feel like I should parry you.

4175
04:14:35,360 --> 04:14:36,840
Like I need to go.

4176
04:14:37,639 --> 04:14:39,489
Well, parry this.

4177
04:14:40,129 --> 04:14:49,969
That's not going to work.

4178
04:14:49,969 --> 04:14:51,250
You know, let me know if you want to think about that.

4179
04:14:55,280 --> 04:14:56,639
Oh, here's the edge.

4180
04:14:58,100 --> 04:15:02,340
The game sucks.

4181
04:15:03,059 --> 04:15:07,379
You know, I could see how two table tennis enthusiasts

4182
04:15:08,559 --> 04:15:11,040
could really play this and add love every second of it.

4183
04:15:11,040 --> 04:15:11,840
It's, it's really-

4184
04:15:11,840 --> 04:15:12,639
The physics are-

4185
04:15:13,760 --> 04:15:14,319
It's pretty good.

4186
04:15:14,319 --> 04:15:15,440
Surprisingly accurate.

4187
04:15:15,440 --> 04:15:16,479
I was pointing out on my stream

4188
04:15:16,479 --> 04:15:18,079
there's like two things it does wrong,

4189
04:15:18,079 --> 04:15:18,879
but they're not-

4190
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:24,840
That big of a deal.

4191
04:15:24,840 --> 04:15:26,280
The biggest way you can tell-

4192
04:15:26,280 --> 04:15:29,799
You can actually change how much in your paddle has.

4193
04:15:30,520 --> 04:15:30,920
Oh, really?

4194
04:15:30,920 --> 04:15:31,959
And the options and everything

4195
04:15:31,959 --> 04:15:33,239
and change what kind of paddle it is.

4196
04:15:33,799 --> 04:15:34,120
That's cool.

4197
04:15:34,120 --> 04:15:35,559
But if you have a really spinning paddle

4198
04:15:35,559 --> 04:15:36,440
and you just put the ball on it

4199
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:37,479
and you move the ball around,

4200
04:15:38,040 --> 04:15:41,239
it's pretty fully accurate to what it would do

4201
04:15:41,799 --> 04:15:42,520
and how it would feel.

4202
04:15:43,719 --> 04:15:45,159
The feedback when you hit the ball,

4203
04:15:45,159 --> 04:15:46,200
that little like knee.

4204
04:15:47,159 --> 04:15:47,719
Yeah.

4205
04:15:47,719 --> 04:15:49,559
It's like you can actually feel like-

4206
04:15:50,840 --> 04:15:52,920
You actually, you know, you feel like Spider-Man.

4207
04:15:52,920 --> 04:15:53,399
You know what I'm saying?

4208
04:15:54,440 --> 04:15:55,639
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

4209
04:16:03,350 --> 04:16:09,649
Ha ha ha.

4210
04:16:09,649 --> 04:16:11,000
Fuck.

4211
04:16:11,000 --> 04:16:12,200
Hey, pro tip.

4212
04:16:13,079 --> 04:16:13,879
Hey, pro tip.

4213
04:16:14,680 --> 04:16:16,049
You're not listening.

4214
04:16:16,049 --> 04:16:17,090
If I swing down,

4215
04:16:18,049 --> 04:16:19,649
the ball's going to drop down.

4216
04:16:19,649 --> 04:16:22,049
If I swing up, the ball is going to go up.

4217
04:16:22,770 --> 04:16:24,450
When you see me doing these big swings

4218
04:16:25,090 --> 04:16:26,850
and your paddle's flat,

4219
04:16:26,850 --> 04:16:27,969
it's going to go straight down.

4220
04:16:29,010 --> 04:16:30,129
Okay, so when you go like this,

4221
04:16:30,129 --> 04:16:30,690
go like this.

4222
04:16:30,690 --> 04:16:31,969
And when you go like this,

4223
04:16:31,969 --> 04:16:32,930
go like this.

4224
04:16:32,930 --> 04:16:34,290
When I go down,

4225
04:16:34,290 --> 04:16:36,610
you need to make your paddle like this.

4226
04:16:36,610 --> 04:16:38,370
When it hits here, down is forward.

4227
04:16:39,010 --> 04:16:40,530
You get it, down is forward now.

4228
04:16:42,129 --> 04:16:43,649
Oh, okay.

4229
04:16:43,649 --> 04:16:45,329
So like in one of those mirror puzzle games,

4230
04:16:45,329 --> 04:16:46,770
where I have to bend the laser.

4231
04:16:48,639 --> 04:16:50,079
Yes, you have to bend the laser.

4232
04:16:50,079 --> 04:16:52,079
Move the laser with the mirror into the spot

4233
04:16:52,079 --> 04:16:52,719
and you get the key.

4234
04:16:52,719 --> 04:16:53,200
Yeah.

4235
04:16:53,200 --> 04:16:53,680
Okay.

4236
04:16:53,680 --> 04:16:54,180
Yeah.

4237
04:16:58,370 --> 04:16:59,010
You did it.

4238
04:16:59,010 --> 04:16:59,569
That was good.

4239
04:17:04,129 --> 04:17:05,329
Why am I hearing voices?

4240
04:17:07,329 --> 04:17:09,250
This is the first time you've asked yourself that.

4241
04:17:09,250 --> 04:17:10,049
No, no, no, no.

4242
04:17:13,239 --> 04:17:14,600
I'm hearing voices.

4243
04:17:17,110 --> 04:17:17,750
I swear.

4244
04:17:27,139 --> 04:17:28,290
Got him.

4245
04:17:28,290 --> 04:17:28,850
That didn't count?

4246
04:17:28,850 --> 04:17:29,649
What?

4247
04:17:29,649 --> 04:17:31,059
That's my point.

4248
04:17:36,579 --> 04:17:37,379
I had to itch.

4249
04:17:38,020 --> 04:17:40,819
I have an inside of my nose itch.

4250
04:17:55,280 --> 04:17:55,520
See?

4251
04:18:00,069 --> 04:18:01,270
Wait, you're in the closet.

4252
04:18:01,909 --> 04:18:03,159
Get out of my way.

4253
04:18:05,350 --> 04:18:06,870
I was in the closet the whole time.

4254
04:18:08,899 --> 04:18:09,219
All right.

4255
04:18:09,219 --> 04:18:10,020
How are you doing?

4256
04:18:10,020 --> 04:18:10,739
You good?

4257
04:18:10,739 --> 04:18:11,620
Watch replay.

4258
04:18:12,340 --> 04:18:14,629
Why would you want me to watch this one?

4259
04:18:14,629 --> 04:18:19,329
All right.

4260
04:18:19,329 --> 04:18:20,690
I'll watch the replay.

4261
04:18:20,690 --> 04:18:34,149
Oh, where's the game?

4262
04:18:35,110 --> 04:18:35,350
What?

4263
04:18:35,989 --> 04:18:36,790
I have the replay.

4264
04:18:36,790 --> 04:18:37,350
It's not playing.

4265
04:18:40,100 --> 04:18:41,860
Why do you keep watching the replay?

4266
04:18:41,860 --> 04:18:42,579
I don't understand.

4267
04:18:42,579 --> 04:18:43,459
You just played.

4268
04:18:43,459 --> 04:18:45,540
Because Chad's saying watch replay.

4269
04:18:46,260 --> 04:18:52,500
All right.

4270
04:18:52,500 --> 04:18:53,379
Anything else you want to do?

4271
04:18:54,680 --> 04:18:56,200
I could do this forever, so.

4272
04:18:56,200 --> 04:18:57,399
You could do this forever.

4273
04:18:58,120 --> 04:18:59,959
I get trapped in the loop.

4274
04:19:03,829 --> 04:19:04,629
One guy.

4275
04:19:07,799 --> 04:19:09,879
Watch the bot, one person says.

4276
04:19:10,680 --> 04:19:12,469
Do you have anything else?

4277
04:19:12,469 --> 04:19:14,229
Do you have any other experiences you want to just try?

4278
04:19:18,180 --> 04:19:21,879
It would be cool if I could show you the minigame, but I can't.

4279
04:19:21,879 --> 04:19:22,440
No.

4280
04:19:22,440 --> 04:19:24,040
Because you can't actually multiplayer that.

4281
04:19:24,040 --> 04:19:25,000
They don't really know me.

4282
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:25,399
Just see.

4283
04:19:27,479 --> 04:19:29,479
Oh, listen to the voices.

4284
04:19:30,520 --> 04:19:35,520
Let me see what else we got.

4285
04:19:41,159 --> 04:19:43,000
Oh, we can go for like four and a half hours or so.

4286
04:19:43,799 --> 04:19:46,879
Turret looks really dirty.

4287
04:19:46,879 --> 04:19:47,920
I'm just really sweaty.

4288
04:19:51,159 --> 04:19:51,959
Pavlov.

4289
04:19:51,959 --> 04:19:53,399
Everybody wants us to play Pavlov.

4290
04:19:54,840 --> 04:19:56,920
I would play it, but I think we should do it another day.

4291
04:19:56,920 --> 04:19:57,719
You want to do it another day?

4292
04:19:57,719 --> 04:19:58,840
To get its own thing, yeah.

4293
04:19:59,559 --> 04:20:01,190
What are you doing tomorrow?

4294
04:20:04,079 --> 04:20:05,200
Playing Pavlov with you.

4295
04:20:05,200 --> 04:20:06,479
You want to play Pavlov tomorrow?

4296
04:20:07,120 --> 04:20:08,549
Sure.

4297
04:20:08,549 --> 04:20:10,360
I don't think I'm doing anything.

4298
04:20:10,920 --> 04:20:12,790
I mean, it's up to you.

4299
04:20:13,590 --> 04:20:15,110
Yeah, I'm saying yes.

4300
04:20:15,110 --> 04:20:15,590
Okay.

4301
04:20:15,590 --> 04:20:17,430
Maybe we'll get like another couple to play.

4302
04:20:18,819 --> 04:20:19,780
He's bruised.

4303
04:20:19,780 --> 04:20:22,180
Yeah, but I have like actually bruised cheeks.

4304
04:20:22,899 --> 04:20:27,409
Are we getting desert bus today?

4305
04:20:27,409 --> 04:20:28,129
We completed it.

4306
04:20:28,129 --> 04:20:28,850
We did the whole thing.

4307
04:20:29,569 --> 04:20:33,010
Yeah, it's over.

4308
04:20:35,000 --> 04:20:36,520
I'm like so into VR.

4309
04:20:36,520 --> 04:20:38,680
Sorry that I'm like a VR streamer.

4310
04:20:38,680 --> 04:20:39,239
Like, no.

4311
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:43,879
We had Pavlov onward.

4312
04:20:43,879 --> 04:20:45,079
There was a couple others.

4313
04:20:45,079 --> 04:20:45,719
Where was that list?

4314
04:20:46,440 --> 04:20:48,610
Show controller?

4315
04:20:48,610 --> 04:20:49,329
Oh, here, I'll show you.

4316
04:20:49,969 --> 04:20:52,079
I don't know if you can see it in the camera,

4317
04:20:52,079 --> 04:20:54,319
but like it's I like chipped off like the front here.

4318
04:20:55,600 --> 04:20:57,510
See like that.

4319
04:20:58,229 --> 04:21:05,889
Like a little focuses right here.

4320
04:21:06,450 --> 04:21:09,680
There's like an indent and like it's white.

4321
04:21:12,959 --> 04:21:13,360
I like.

4322
04:21:17,190 --> 04:21:17,590
Let me see.

4323
04:21:17,590 --> 04:21:19,430
Yeah, this is like a bunch of stuff to play.

4324
04:21:20,149 --> 04:21:26,469
Are you still here?

4325
04:21:27,270 --> 04:21:33,059
Yeah, I can't find where the thing is in this game.

4326
04:21:36,500 --> 04:21:37,940
I also want to play like Mind Show.

4327
04:21:37,940 --> 04:21:39,940
There's so much like fucking VR I want to play.

4328
04:21:43,170 --> 04:21:45,010
But we can call here if you want.

4329
04:21:45,010 --> 04:21:48,610
Take a break because the drunken bar fight game.

4330
04:21:48,610 --> 04:21:52,479
I act like sometimes I get in one of these games

4331
04:21:52,479 --> 04:21:53,680
and like an after an hour goes by

4332
04:21:53,680 --> 04:21:56,079
and I'm just getting constant fucking pain from either laughing

4333
04:21:56,079 --> 04:21:57,520
or like fucking wheezing.

4334
04:22:00,000 --> 04:22:01,920
There's a multiplayer mod for Beat Saber.

4335
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:02,479
Are you serious?

4336
04:22:04,530 --> 04:22:08,049
My understanding is just that it shows your scores at the same time.

4337
04:22:08,049 --> 04:22:10,290
So you're competing for a better score on the same level.

4338
04:22:12,129 --> 04:22:13,729
If there's something else, I don't know about it.

4339
04:22:14,450 --> 04:22:16,930
People saying we should play Minecraft in VR.

4340
04:22:18,360 --> 04:22:19,479
Oh, yeah, Minecraft.

4341
04:22:20,120 --> 04:22:20,680
God, no.

4342
04:22:22,920 --> 04:22:25,399
Yeah, we'll play some more stuff tomorrow.

4343
04:22:25,399 --> 04:22:26,680
We'll do Pavlov tomorrow.

4344
04:22:26,680 --> 04:22:28,520
We'll give like Pavlov like a real

4345
04:22:29,159 --> 04:22:32,760
because that's like a full on multiplayer shooter experience, isn't it?

4346
04:22:35,879 --> 04:22:36,360
Pavlov?

4347
04:22:36,920 --> 04:22:37,399
Pavlov.

4348
04:22:37,399 --> 04:22:38,280
I think so.

4349
04:22:38,280 --> 04:22:38,920
All right.

4350
04:22:38,920 --> 04:22:43,959
Well, that's probably as good as any time to call it for the day.

4351
04:22:44,680 --> 04:22:47,399
I'm going to wake up sore tomorrow.

4352
04:22:47,719 --> 04:22:48,360
That's the thing.

4353
04:22:48,360 --> 04:22:49,879
When I've been playing so much VR,

4354
04:22:49,879 --> 04:22:52,280
I'm like building up my muscular tolerance again.

4355
04:22:53,000 --> 04:23:00,559
You should do Mind Show for your own full stream.

4356
04:23:00,559 --> 04:23:03,680
Yeah, that's why I'm like Mr. VR.

4357
04:23:04,799 --> 04:23:05,440
Oh, my God.

4358
04:23:07,860 --> 04:23:09,459
How many times did I slam into a wall today?

4359
04:23:09,459 --> 04:23:09,940
Like six?

4360
04:23:10,579 --> 04:23:13,219
How many times did he slam into a wall?

4361
04:23:13,860 --> 04:23:16,129
Like two?

4362
04:23:16,850 --> 04:23:20,309
I think it was two.

4363
04:23:22,819 --> 04:23:24,180
You sunk my battleship today.

4364
04:23:24,819 --> 04:23:27,520
We love the VR.

4365
04:23:27,520 --> 04:23:28,399
It's not a problem.

4366
04:23:28,399 --> 04:23:30,000
I mean, it's just so much fun.

4367
04:23:30,799 --> 04:23:33,200
It's something I've never had this experience before in my life.

4368
04:23:33,760 --> 04:23:35,360
So it's worth having.

4369
04:23:36,079 --> 04:23:37,399
All right.

4370
04:23:37,399 --> 04:23:38,200
Let me get this off.

4371
04:23:39,090 --> 04:23:42,370
And we'll start probably on the same time tomorrow if you want.

4372
04:23:45,000 --> 04:23:46,120
So thanks for hanging out, everybody.

4373
04:23:47,000 --> 04:23:50,979
Yeah, this will be like just about probably like a four and a half, five hour stream.

4374
04:23:51,540 --> 04:23:52,579
It's kind of what they've been.

4375
04:23:53,379 --> 04:23:54,500
Just only so long I can do it.

4376
04:23:57,090 --> 04:23:59,329
But yeah, I'll be in touch.

4377
04:23:59,969 --> 04:24:01,250
We'll figure out what games we're going to play.

4378
04:24:05,059 --> 04:24:06,260
Bye, everyone.

4379
04:24:06,260 --> 04:24:06,739
Say bye.

4380
04:24:06,739 --> 04:24:09,299
And like, he has a Twitch, you know.

4381
04:24:10,549 --> 04:24:13,829
And I have a YouTube channel where I'm not allowed to upload videos anymore.

4382
04:24:13,829 --> 04:24:14,389
That's true.

4383
04:24:15,190 --> 04:24:15,989
It's a court order.

4384
04:24:17,510 --> 04:24:19,110
Can we get a stirrer link here?

4385
04:24:21,590 --> 04:24:23,909
What are you, what's your number one game in?

4386
04:24:23,909 --> 04:24:24,389
Apex?

4387
04:24:25,110 --> 04:24:26,309
My other, my what?

4388
04:24:26,309 --> 04:24:27,430
What's your number one game in?

4389
04:24:27,430 --> 04:24:28,149
Like Apex?

4390
04:24:30,340 --> 04:24:33,090
Getting dirty club.

4391
04:24:33,090 --> 04:24:35,479
I stream it all.

4392
04:24:37,700 --> 04:24:40,659
You've really been into that like press the button with the monster voice today.

4393
04:24:40,659 --> 04:24:42,819
I like the monster voice because it really

4394
04:24:44,680 --> 04:24:45,879
Then you know I'm for real.

4395
04:24:48,370 --> 04:24:50,610
No, I got to like, I'm going to physically like type your name.

4396
04:24:52,159 --> 04:24:52,479
Dude, I don't know.

4397
04:24:52,479 --> 04:24:53,280
It's stir, right?

4398
04:24:57,750 --> 04:24:58,149
I don't know.

4399
04:24:58,149 --> 04:24:59,430
You change your name sometimes.

4400
04:25:01,879 --> 04:25:03,239
Like four years ago.

4401
04:25:03,239 --> 04:25:03,879
Who was this?

4402
04:25:03,879 --> 04:25:05,559
I don't even know who he is anymore.

4403
04:25:05,559 --> 04:25:07,639
We played Lethal League like a week ago.

4404
04:25:07,639 --> 04:25:08,680
Relax.

4405
04:25:08,680 --> 04:25:09,319
What is your name?

4406
04:25:09,319 --> 04:25:10,440
Like German948?

4407
04:25:13,959 --> 04:25:15,159
Yeah, we already talked about the forest.

4408
04:25:15,159 --> 04:25:17,559
You didn't want to do the forest because of the, it was going to take too long.

4409
04:25:18,120 --> 04:25:21,959
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't want a full stream of a full forest stream.

4410
04:25:22,760 --> 04:25:24,979
Oh, man.

4411
04:25:25,620 --> 04:25:26,840
All right.

4412
04:25:26,840 --> 04:25:28,040
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

4413
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:28,840
We'll play some more.

4414
04:25:28,840 --> 04:25:29,079
Yeah.

4415
04:25:29,079 --> 04:25:29,399
Thanks.

4416
04:25:29,399 --> 04:25:31,399
Thanks for our first ever collab we did today.

4417
04:25:31,399 --> 04:25:32,520
Maybe we can do more.

4418
04:25:32,520 --> 04:25:33,780
Yeah.

4419
04:25:33,780 --> 04:25:34,819
Now have a good night.

4420
04:25:34,819 --> 04:25:36,389
Good night.

4421
04:25:36,389 --> 04:25:37,200
Bye.

4422
04:25:37,760 --> 04:25:39,459
Yeah.

4423
04:25:39,459 --> 04:25:39,940
We'll see you.

4424
04:25:40,579 --> 04:25:46,879
Just putting like weird pressure on my eyes and eyebrows and I feel like my eyebrow.

4425
04:25:46,879 --> 04:25:48,959
I look like a different like a different person.

4426
04:25:48,959 --> 04:25:51,219
It's like squishing my eyelids.

4427
04:25:53,520 --> 04:25:53,760
All right.

4428
04:25:53,760 --> 04:25:55,120
Let's get to the bits here.

4429
04:25:56,469 --> 04:25:57,430
See you guys tomorrow.

4430
04:25:57,430 --> 04:25:58,069
It's taking off.

4431
04:25:58,950 --> 04:26:00,229
More multiplayer VR.

4432
04:26:02,639 --> 04:26:04,559
I'm going to pad my room.

4433
04:26:07,110 --> 04:26:09,030
You look weird when you do that.

4434
04:26:09,030 --> 04:26:10,870
I look weird probably every day.

4435
04:26:11,590 --> 04:26:14,120
Do Google Earth VR.

4436
04:26:14,120 --> 04:26:15,159
Can you do that multiplayer?

4437
04:26:15,719 --> 04:26:17,379
That doesn't work multiplayer, does it?

4438
04:26:17,940 --> 04:26:23,159
All right.

4439
04:26:23,159 --> 04:26:25,719
Let's get out of this and put this up.

4440
04:26:26,680 --> 04:26:27,559
No, that's not VRB.

4441
04:26:28,360 --> 04:26:30,899
We need to see a later one.

4442
04:26:32,850 --> 04:26:33,489
There it goes.

4443
04:26:33,489 --> 04:26:33,729
Okay.

4444
04:26:33,729 --> 04:26:34,930
Let me get out of here.

4445
04:26:34,930 --> 04:26:36,450
Payday 2 has VR.

4446
04:26:36,450 --> 04:26:40,000
Yeah, I had a fucking lot of fun though.

4447
04:26:41,700 --> 04:26:49,799
Even in like rec room and then that zombie game started out kind of a little bit annoying,

4448
04:26:49,799 --> 04:26:52,360
but turned out to be absolutely fucking fun.

4449
04:26:56,850 --> 04:26:58,290
I could see how if you get four of your friends,

4450
04:26:58,290 --> 04:26:59,889
that would be some of the most fun you could probably have.

4451
04:27:00,610 --> 04:27:02,500
But no, that's I love it.

4452
04:27:03,059 --> 04:27:09,239
So we'll see you tomorrow.

4453
04:27:09,879 --> 04:27:10,600
Here come the bits.

4454
04:27:11,620 --> 04:27:12,579
Thanks everyone for sticking around.

4455
04:27:13,719 --> 04:27:14,520
See you real soon.

4456
04:27:15,649 --> 04:27:19,569
And let's go back about four to four and a half hours ago here.

4457
04:27:21,159 --> 04:27:24,450
Stirr hosted you with one viewer.

4458
04:27:28,840 --> 04:27:29,079
What?

4459
04:27:29,799 --> 04:27:30,520
With what?

4460
04:27:30,520 --> 04:27:30,840
Him?

4461
04:27:31,719 --> 04:27:32,280
Was it him?

4462
04:27:32,280 --> 04:27:33,399
Was it he the only one?

4463
04:27:34,120 --> 04:27:38,159
Thanks a lot Stirr for those.

4464
04:27:42,079 --> 04:27:43,040
That's so funny.

4465
04:27:45,440 --> 04:27:46,639
It was just him.

4466
04:27:47,680 --> 04:27:48,879
You probably didn't do it right.

4467
04:27:50,600 --> 04:27:51,319
Oh my God.

4468
04:27:52,280 --> 04:27:53,559
Thank you Divus for the 250.

4469
04:27:54,200 --> 04:27:55,399
Appreciate it.

4470
04:27:55,399 --> 04:28:01,809
Let me get the chat out here.

4471
04:28:02,530 --> 04:28:03,969
The actual chat.

4472
04:28:03,969 --> 04:28:11,729
Let me shut down that VR.

4473
04:28:11,729 --> 04:28:12,209
Real quick.

4474
04:28:12,850 --> 04:28:15,760
Is there a multiplayer horror game?

4475
04:28:15,760 --> 04:28:16,879
No, there really isn't.

4476
04:28:17,520 --> 04:28:19,200
That's kind of sad and unfortunate.

4477
04:28:21,329 --> 04:28:23,250
I was we've been looking.

4478
04:28:23,969 --> 04:28:27,700
There really is not a horror VR multiplayer game.

4479
04:28:32,260 --> 04:28:36,040
Unfortunately, raw data is kind of horror.

4480
04:28:41,409 --> 04:28:42,930
Jet Island, he won't play it.

4481
04:28:44,870 --> 04:28:47,350
He already told me he saw me playing that game.

4482
04:28:47,350 --> 04:28:49,030
He's like, I wouldn't be able to do it.

4483
04:28:49,030 --> 04:28:54,719
It's hard enough to make a good multiplayer horror game

4484
04:28:54,719 --> 04:28:55,520
in general anyway.

4485
04:28:55,520 --> 04:28:56,399
Yeah, it is.

4486
04:29:00,180 --> 04:29:03,139
But thank you to Divus.

4487
04:29:03,139 --> 04:29:04,579
Thank you Bake Me Home for the 250.

4488
04:29:06,309 --> 04:29:07,750
Thank you Fitty for the five bucks.

4489
04:29:08,549 --> 04:29:10,709
This makes it a hundred thousand dollars.

4490
04:29:10,709 --> 04:29:12,469
Can you please release my family now?

4491
04:29:13,989 --> 04:29:15,510
Are they even alive still?

4492
04:29:15,510 --> 04:29:16,149
Please Jeremy.

4493
04:29:17,190 --> 04:29:20,579
Thank you Fitty for the five bucks.

4494
04:29:20,579 --> 04:29:21,139
Appreciate it.

4495
04:29:25,329 --> 04:29:26,690
Thank you Num Legs for the ten bucks.

4496
04:29:28,290 --> 04:29:28,690
Thank you.

4497
04:29:30,069 --> 04:29:30,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4498
04:29:31,510 --> 04:29:37,649
There's a horror game called The Exorcist Legion VR.

4499
04:29:37,649 --> 04:29:38,530
Is that?

4500
04:29:38,530 --> 04:29:41,319
Didn't acknowledge what?

4501
04:29:43,079 --> 04:29:44,360
Oh, oh, oh, you guys are okay.

4502
04:29:45,489 --> 04:29:48,049
Is The Exorcist multiplayer?

4503
04:29:48,049 --> 04:29:51,110
Or is it just single player?

4504
04:29:58,629 --> 04:30:00,229
Exorcist VR is supposed to be legit.

4505
04:30:01,670 --> 04:30:06,479
I'm telling you, that Dread Halls was one of the most

4506
04:30:06,479 --> 04:30:08,959
nerve-wracking, stressful horror games I've ever played.

4507
04:30:10,399 --> 04:30:12,399
And yeah, I'm a little biased here

4508
04:30:12,399 --> 04:30:14,799
because it's one of the only VR horror games I've ever played.

4509
04:30:15,440 --> 04:30:18,479
But it was horrible.

4510
04:30:18,479 --> 04:30:21,680
Still going to do Mind Show?

4511
04:30:21,680 --> 04:30:21,920
Yes.

4512
04:30:24,479 --> 04:30:29,040
This co-op VR kind of couple of streams here in a row with Star.

4513
04:30:30,149 --> 04:30:31,030
They just kind of happened.

4514
04:30:31,590 --> 04:30:34,069
So my plan wasn't really part of the plan,

4515
04:30:34,069 --> 04:30:36,930
but we were just like, hey, let's do it.

4516
04:30:39,719 --> 04:30:42,200
But thank you Zombie Man for the five bucks.

4517
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:44,120
Sorry, Jeremy, for the messages I was trying to send.

4518
04:30:44,120 --> 04:30:45,639
Cheers your way.

4519
04:30:45,639 --> 04:30:47,639
And they are right next to my friend invite.

4520
04:30:48,450 --> 04:30:49,090
No, it's fine.

4521
04:30:49,090 --> 04:30:49,809
Don't worry about it, man.

4522
04:30:54,149 --> 04:30:55,030
Thank you for the five bucks.

4523
04:30:55,030 --> 04:30:55,510
Appreciate it.

4524
04:30:58,739 --> 04:31:00,260
Miss Melon T, thanks for the two fifty.

4525
04:31:01,250 --> 04:31:03,729
It's really nice to draw some pixel art watching your streams,

4526
04:31:03,729 --> 04:31:04,450
Jeremy.

4527
04:31:04,450 --> 04:31:06,129
Glad to catch your streams when I'm not working.

4528
04:31:06,129 --> 04:31:09,569
Seriously appreciate the company from both you and the Discord chat.

4529
04:31:10,370 --> 04:31:13,879
Jeremy Hart, thank you.

4530
04:31:17,040 --> 04:31:19,600
If I could just kind of be in the background while you do some work,

4531
04:31:19,600 --> 04:31:21,120
that's awesome.

4532
04:31:22,120 --> 04:31:22,760
Glad you're hanging out.

4533
04:31:22,760 --> 04:31:23,959
Glad you can relax.

4534
04:31:23,959 --> 04:31:30,440
And we do have a pretty good Discord community.

4535
04:31:30,440 --> 04:31:31,750
You haven't joined it yet.

4536
04:31:31,750 --> 04:31:32,229
It is there.

4537
04:31:32,229 --> 04:31:32,790
It's available.

4538
04:31:33,780 --> 04:31:34,579
Open to the public.

4539
04:31:35,440 --> 04:31:37,040
There is one sub only room,

4540
04:31:37,040 --> 04:31:38,879
but the whole thing is open to the public.

4541
04:31:41,989 --> 04:31:44,370
Just good people there.

4542
04:31:44,370 --> 04:31:45,010
Discord.

4543
04:31:45,569 --> 04:31:49,079
Not discourse, discord.

4544
04:31:49,079 --> 04:31:50,840
But thank you, Miss Melon T.

4545
04:31:51,559 --> 04:31:53,559
And then Bloody Doctor gave fifty dollars earlier.

4546
04:31:54,200 --> 04:31:55,239
I missed it completely.

4547
04:31:55,239 --> 04:31:58,370
I don't have notifications on when I'm in VR.

4548
04:31:58,930 --> 04:32:02,129
Because I find it's hard to pull out and see.

4549
04:32:03,010 --> 04:32:04,450
So I don't have notifications on.

4550
04:32:05,409 --> 04:32:07,329
But if you do end up seeing this, Bloody Doctor,

4551
04:32:07,329 --> 04:32:08,850
thank you so much for the fifty fucking dollars.

4552
04:32:08,850 --> 04:32:11,840
It's a lot of money.

4553
04:32:11,840 --> 04:32:12,399
It means a lot.

4554
04:32:16,100 --> 04:32:18,020
The TJ, thanks for the five community subs.

4555
04:32:21,889 --> 04:32:23,250
They came in a few hours ago.

4556
04:32:25,649 --> 04:32:28,290
Then TJ, right after that, gave fifteen bucks.

4557
04:32:28,290 --> 04:32:31,620
Hey Jeremy, back again from overseas.

4558
04:32:32,260 --> 04:32:34,819
Showing my love again with the deployment cashola.

4559
04:32:34,819 --> 04:32:35,940
Have fun in VR, my dudes.

4560
04:32:36,420 --> 04:32:37,700
I'm off to my plane now.

4561
04:32:37,700 --> 04:32:39,139
We'll have to catch back up at the VOD.

4562
04:32:39,780 --> 04:32:40,819
Peace stream, boys.

4563
04:32:41,379 --> 04:32:44,020
Thank you so much.

4564
04:32:44,020 --> 04:32:44,500
Welcome back.

4565
04:32:48,129 --> 04:32:50,930
Yeah, I really appreciate the five community subs

4566
04:32:50,930 --> 04:32:51,889
and the fifteen bucks.

4567
04:32:52,450 --> 04:32:54,950
Thank you.

4568
04:33:04,790 --> 04:33:05,990
When's this shit start?

4569
04:33:05,990 --> 04:33:06,790
Let's party.

4570
04:33:08,389 --> 04:33:09,349
Sark.

4571
04:33:09,349 --> 04:33:11,330
What's up, Sark?

4572
04:33:13,750 --> 04:33:14,709
You want to play VR?

4573
04:33:14,709 --> 04:33:16,229
You want to do some VR bullshit?

4574
04:33:16,229 --> 04:33:16,709
I'm down.

4575
04:33:17,799 --> 04:33:21,639
But my eyes can only take like four to five hours though.

4576
04:33:23,860 --> 04:33:26,979
My brain can actually only handle it for like four hours.

4577
04:33:26,979 --> 04:33:32,740
It's good to see you again though.

4578
04:33:32,740 --> 04:33:34,080
Hope you're doing well, Sark.

4579
04:33:34,639 --> 04:33:38,720
Can we turn off the slow mode?

4580
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:40,240
Yeah, we can probably turn it off now.

4581
04:33:40,240 --> 04:33:42,400
We're at the end of the stream.

4582
04:33:42,400 --> 04:33:45,889
Probably just dump slow mode.

4583
04:33:48,099 --> 04:33:50,259
I just puked when he said VR.

4584
04:33:54,180 --> 04:33:55,619
Can we turn up slow mode?

4585
04:33:56,439 --> 04:33:57,240
Now you don't have to turn it up.

4586
04:34:00,290 --> 04:34:02,209
Sports Bar VR has multiplayer games.

4587
04:34:02,930 --> 04:34:03,650
Probably check it out.

4588
04:34:03,650 --> 04:34:04,290
We have a list.

4589
04:34:04,930 --> 04:34:07,560
We picked, over the last day or two,

4590
04:34:07,560 --> 04:34:10,340
I've been just doing some research to find some good ones.

4591
04:34:10,340 --> 04:34:12,580
And there's a list of like fifteen games we have.

4592
04:34:13,299 --> 04:34:14,900
We sort of just kind of threw darts.

4593
04:34:14,900 --> 04:34:18,389
And we're like, that one, that one, that one, that one, and that one.

4594
04:34:18,389 --> 04:34:20,310
And that's what we'll have time to do, I guess.

4595
04:34:20,950 --> 04:34:22,229
So we'll do that again for tomorrow.

4596
04:34:28,560 --> 04:34:34,080
But thank you, Combine, for the five, six, seven, eight dollars and eighty-seven cents.

4597
04:34:35,599 --> 04:34:36,000
Thank you.

4598
04:34:37,650 --> 04:34:41,330
Why can't you do such a simple thing as walking, you absolute donut?

4599
04:34:41,330 --> 04:34:44,209
Please actually tell me, you absolute goddamn buffoon.

4600
04:34:44,770 --> 04:34:46,150
I love your videos, man.

4601
04:34:46,150 --> 04:34:46,470
Cheers.

4602
04:34:48,709 --> 04:34:51,990
Well, that was during the survive portion of the stream.

4603
04:34:52,069 --> 04:34:54,470
And I had like the arms moving thing set up.

4604
04:34:54,470 --> 04:34:58,720
And you saw, on screen, that it was really, really wonky.

4605
04:34:58,720 --> 04:35:00,880
It didn't work out as what I thought it was.

4606
04:35:00,880 --> 04:35:03,720
I changed and did just fine.

4607
04:35:03,720 --> 04:35:04,819
But thank you.

4608
04:35:04,819 --> 04:35:05,810
Appreciate it.

4609
04:35:07,700 --> 04:35:09,220
You absolute donut.

4610
04:35:10,389 --> 04:35:11,430
I'll move those words around.

4611
04:35:11,430 --> 04:35:14,470
It's fucking, you fucking absolute you nut.

4612
04:35:15,029 --> 04:35:15,990
I'm a unit.

4613
04:35:15,990 --> 04:35:17,490
I'm a you nut.

4614
04:35:17,490 --> 04:35:17,889
Thanks, man.

4615
04:35:17,889 --> 04:35:18,529
Appreciate that.

4616
04:35:20,479 --> 04:35:23,439
They also say your face brightens up my dull days whenever I come home from work.

4617
04:35:24,549 --> 04:35:26,869
Your presence gives me warmth like no other person

4618
04:35:26,869 --> 04:35:28,709
not even your father.

4619
04:35:28,709 --> 04:35:32,369
Jerma, I'm so proud of you and all of your brothers.

4620
04:35:32,369 --> 04:35:35,330
Jack, Jomi, Garrence, and little Jerma, my lovely boys.

4621
04:35:35,330 --> 04:35:37,409
You are my absolute champion of a boy.

4622
04:35:37,409 --> 04:35:38,689
You must come visit me sometime.

4623
04:35:38,689 --> 04:35:40,209
Sincerely, your loving, proud mother.

4624
04:35:41,110 --> 04:35:42,069
Combine.

4625
04:35:42,069 --> 04:35:45,240
PS, here's my social security number.

4626
04:35:45,240 --> 04:35:48,279
What are you doing?

4627
04:35:48,279 --> 04:35:48,680
Thank you.

4628
04:35:49,909 --> 04:35:50,549
Peaceful Haley.

4629
04:35:50,549 --> 04:35:52,150
Thanks for the 250, Peaceful Haley.

4630
04:35:52,150 --> 04:35:54,610
Hey, Jerma, today's stream was a lot of fun.

4631
04:35:54,610 --> 04:35:55,889
I couldn't stop laughing the whole time.

4632
04:35:55,889 --> 04:35:57,250
Anyways, hope all is well for you.

4633
04:35:57,810 --> 04:36:00,770
Have a good night, Jerma, and chat.

4634
04:36:00,770 --> 04:36:01,650
Thank you, Haley.

4635
04:36:03,860 --> 04:36:04,500
Always a pleasure.

4636
04:36:04,500 --> 04:36:05,220
Thank you.

4637
04:36:05,220 --> 04:36:07,750
Glad you had fun.

4638
04:36:07,750 --> 04:36:08,630
Read it.

4639
04:36:08,630 --> 04:36:08,950
Fine.

4640
04:36:09,590 --> 04:36:10,069
No.

4641
04:36:10,069 --> 04:36:10,709
No, it's a joke.

4642
04:36:10,709 --> 04:36:13,830
It's like J9858985.

4643
04:36:13,830 --> 04:36:15,830
I read that completely wrong.

4644
04:36:15,830 --> 04:36:16,630
I don't want to read that out loud.

4645
04:36:16,630 --> 04:36:20,290
What if it's real somehow?

4646
04:36:20,290 --> 04:36:23,490
Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.

4647
04:36:23,490 --> 04:36:25,250
Mostly lost, thanks for 250.

4648
04:36:25,250 --> 04:36:29,319
How are you so bad at Five Finger Filet and Red Dead Redemption

4649
04:36:29,319 --> 04:36:31,720
but you're perfect at it in a VR game?

4650
04:36:31,720 --> 04:36:34,049
Because that's just real life.

4651
04:36:35,759 --> 04:36:36,880
I could do that in real life.

4652
04:36:36,880 --> 04:36:43,169
Because I'm not physically lifting my hand up in Red Dead.

4653
04:36:43,169 --> 04:36:47,880
I'm doing like X, circle, square, triangle, X, circle, square,

4654
04:36:47,880 --> 04:36:49,720
triangle, square, square, square, triangle, X.

4655
04:36:49,720 --> 04:37:01,880
I just got a flash of Star doing like the crab walk in the drunk game.

4656
04:37:01,880 --> 04:37:11,400
Oh, this is so dumb.

4657
04:37:12,360 --> 04:37:13,799
But look, look, okay.

4658
04:37:14,680 --> 04:37:16,520
Yeah, that game is like a tuber game.

4659
04:37:17,319 --> 04:37:18,599
But sometimes that don't matter.

4660
04:37:18,599 --> 04:37:20,439
Sometimes that's all you need.

4661
04:37:20,439 --> 04:37:23,159
Just you and a buddy just being just dickheads in a game.

4662
04:37:23,159 --> 04:37:24,040
It's so much fun.

4663
04:37:24,599 --> 04:37:31,939
Sometimes that's actually all you need.

4664
04:37:32,099 --> 04:37:41,110
But thank you to Bloody Doctor again for the five bucks.

4665
04:37:41,110 --> 04:37:44,229
For the love of God, Jerma, your fly is down.

4666
04:37:44,229 --> 04:37:45,430
And they say Star Genius.

4667
04:37:45,430 --> 04:37:46,229
I'm sorry.

4668
04:37:46,229 --> 04:37:47,029
I don't have a fly.

4669
04:37:47,029 --> 04:37:48,630
I'm wearing jogging pants today.

4670
04:37:49,430 --> 04:37:53,729
Tuber, what the fuck?

4671
04:37:54,290 --> 04:37:56,770
Stark, it's not Mr. Stark.

4672
04:37:56,770 --> 04:37:58,529
Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.

4673
04:37:59,169 --> 04:38:00,529
I don't after VR.

4674
04:38:01,889 --> 04:38:02,450
Mr. Stark.

4675
04:38:03,330 --> 04:38:05,349
Tuber is just a tuber.

4676
04:38:08,799 --> 04:38:09,439
Stark.

4677
04:38:12,930 --> 04:38:14,450
I don't know why I added T, I'm sorry.

4678
04:38:18,310 --> 04:38:21,029
I was wearing jogging pants, not a pair of jeans.

4679
04:38:21,830 --> 04:38:26,159
How could you play VR without a full workout gear on?

4680
04:38:26,880 --> 04:38:28,630
Like a hoodie and a pair of jeans.

4681
04:38:30,360 --> 04:38:31,959
Sweat would be dripping down my ass.

4682
04:38:32,930 --> 04:38:34,450
I would have to, it would be embarrassing.

4683
04:38:34,450 --> 04:38:35,889
I would turn around during the stream

4684
04:38:36,529 --> 04:38:42,130
and there would be two fucking huge wet handprint marks on my ass.

4685
04:38:45,250 --> 04:38:47,490
If I was in a pair of jeans, we'd go right through the jeans.

4686
04:38:47,490 --> 04:38:48,049
It'd be horrible.

4687
04:38:48,770 --> 04:38:50,209
I'd probably get like suspended.

4688
04:38:56,159 --> 04:38:58,080
Who's touching your, like me.

4689
04:38:58,080 --> 04:39:02,080
Like I'm grabbing and I'm doing an indentation on my jeans

4690
04:39:03,240 --> 04:39:06,119
and I'm going to grab and like move and push.

4691
04:39:15,590 --> 04:39:17,990
Thank you Nuke for the five community subs as well.

4692
04:39:19,299 --> 04:39:21,619
And then Nuke subscribed themselves.

4693
04:39:21,619 --> 04:39:23,860
So six subs there coming in.

4694
04:39:23,860 --> 04:39:24,580
Thank you for that.

4695
04:39:25,139 --> 04:39:26,369
It means a lot.

4696
04:39:30,319 --> 04:39:31,759
Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the 250.

4697
04:39:31,759 --> 04:39:34,159
Hey, I think you could do with some comedy tips to be funnier.

4698
04:39:34,720 --> 04:39:37,200
Uh, check out this observational comedy master.

4699
04:39:37,840 --> 04:39:38,900
Is this me?

4700
04:39:38,900 --> 04:39:40,020
Are you linking a clip of me?

4701
04:39:40,659 --> 04:39:48,759
What the hell is this?

4702
04:39:48,759 --> 04:39:55,810
Why do, why, why do what a girl said fake mustaches?

4703
04:39:55,810 --> 04:39:56,689
What is this?

4704
04:39:56,689 --> 04:40:02,930
No, this is not the master of comedy.

4705
04:40:02,930 --> 04:40:05,250
This is, this is why do girls wear fake mustaches.

4706
04:40:05,250 --> 04:40:07,490
It's like a commentary video.

4707
04:40:08,369 --> 04:40:10,740
I don't know.

4708
04:40:10,740 --> 04:40:13,650
I show us.

4709
04:40:15,009 --> 04:40:15,889
I don't hold on.

4710
04:40:22,040 --> 04:40:23,560
No, I don't, I don't, I don't.

4711
04:40:23,560 --> 04:40:25,319
This is like somebody's like personal channel.

4712
04:40:26,040 --> 04:40:31,349
I don't like, I don't know if this is like, I don't know what you're doing.

4713
04:40:35,750 --> 04:40:36,709
Where'd the chat just go?

4714
04:40:37,569 --> 04:40:38,770
I lost you.

4715
04:40:38,770 --> 04:40:42,279
Where the hell did everybody go?

4716
04:40:42,279 --> 04:40:50,819
Oh, there you go.

4717
04:40:50,819 --> 04:40:51,299
There we go.

4718
04:40:51,299 --> 04:40:52,500
Now I can see why is it doing this?

4719
04:40:52,500 --> 04:40:53,619
Oh, it's because of OBI drop.

4720
04:40:53,619 --> 04:40:56,770
I see you could learn something.

4721
04:40:56,770 --> 04:40:57,970
I don't need to learn anything.

4722
04:41:00,740 --> 04:41:05,060
Comedy is just, it's whatever you want it to be.

4723
04:41:09,479 --> 04:41:10,840
If you think something's funny and I don't,

4724
04:41:11,799 --> 04:41:13,000
that's comedy for you, not for me.

4725
04:41:20,000 --> 04:41:20,880
That's not true.

4726
04:41:21,680 --> 04:41:22,959
I'm not making a joke.

4727
04:41:22,959 --> 04:41:23,459
All right.

4728
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:31,009
All you need to know is I won the junior Massachusetts standup championship when I was 14.

4729
04:41:32,389 --> 04:41:37,779
I had an amazing bit about how water,

4730
04:41:39,639 --> 04:41:41,720
like why don't people just drink water out of the ocean?

4731
04:41:43,959 --> 04:41:46,040
And I got like a standing ovation.

4732
04:41:46,040 --> 04:41:47,240
I was 14.

4733
04:41:47,240 --> 04:41:48,279
I had like two jokes.

4734
04:41:55,720 --> 04:41:58,119
I did a thing where I was in a boat, like pretending to sail around.

4735
04:41:58,119 --> 04:41:59,479
It's like, oh my God, what are we?

4736
04:41:59,479 --> 04:42:01,959
I can't believe we're, we got no water left.

4737
04:42:01,959 --> 04:42:04,439
And again, it's like, you just drink the water in the ocean.

4738
04:42:04,439 --> 04:42:04,939
Dumb.

4739
04:42:05,419 --> 04:42:10,250
A guy in the front row had to go to the hospital

4740
04:42:10,250 --> 04:42:14,169
because he laughed so hard his face turned red and it turned purple.

4741
04:42:14,970 --> 04:42:20,889
He was like, and like 15 people had helped him out.

4742
04:42:25,180 --> 04:42:28,380
His family sued me after that for comedy negligence.

4743
04:42:29,099 --> 04:42:32,419
I had a great lawyer.

4744
04:42:32,419 --> 04:42:44,819
There's a rumor that you went to actual clown school.

4745
04:42:45,459 --> 04:42:48,020
Let me like hit that right in the,

4746
04:42:48,020 --> 04:42:50,259
let me like just cut the head off that snake here.

4747
04:42:51,060 --> 04:42:54,099
Um, yes, I went to clown college.

4748
04:42:55,509 --> 04:42:56,630
I know all the balloon animals.

4749
04:42:56,630 --> 04:42:58,709
I know dog, I know snake, I know cat.

4750
04:43:01,560 --> 04:43:02,520
I got the nose.

4751
04:43:07,689 --> 04:43:10,330
I graduated top of my class and in my senior project,

4752
04:43:11,209 --> 04:43:13,209
I did such an amazing balloon animal.

4753
04:43:13,209 --> 04:43:15,689
One of my instructors actually was sitting in the front row.

4754
04:43:15,689 --> 04:43:17,049
He was, I don't know if he was eating something,

4755
04:43:17,049 --> 04:43:19,450
but he was like, he couldn't believe how fast I did the balloon animal.

4756
04:43:19,450 --> 04:43:21,849
And he started fucking choking and laughing and like,

4757
04:43:24,490 --> 04:43:26,490
like fucking 10 paramedics had to come in.

4758
04:43:28,569 --> 04:43:29,450
I've almost killed him.

4759
04:43:30,250 --> 04:43:31,610
His family gets a fucking lawyer.

4760
04:43:32,330 --> 04:43:33,930
And that would be the second time that that's happened.

4761
04:43:33,930 --> 04:43:36,409
So I think I have a pretty good track record of making people laugh.

4762
04:43:36,409 --> 04:43:43,189
I did a balloon dog in like 1.2 seconds.

4763
04:43:43,189 --> 04:43:43,830
It was so fast.

4764
04:43:43,830 --> 04:43:44,549
He couldn't even handle it.

4765
04:43:44,549 --> 04:43:45,750
He was the instructor of the class.

4766
04:43:49,349 --> 04:43:51,110
Oh my God, I'm choking.

4767
04:43:55,740 --> 04:43:57,099
No, don't get your lawyer.

4768
04:43:57,099 --> 04:43:57,819
I got a good one.

4769
04:44:10,919 --> 04:44:12,119
Hey, what's the deal with water?

4770
04:44:12,119 --> 04:44:13,479
Why did you just drink it out of the ocean?

4771
04:44:19,340 --> 04:44:20,700
I was on the front page of Time Magazine.

4772
04:44:22,020 --> 04:44:23,380
Up and coming comedians.

4773
04:44:23,380 --> 04:44:23,939
That line.

4774
04:44:25,319 --> 04:44:26,360
Top text, bottom text.

4775
04:44:27,000 --> 04:44:28,119
And it was me going like this.

4776
04:44:29,430 --> 04:44:33,029
Like right into the, like here's the cover, right?

4777
04:44:33,029 --> 04:44:33,909
This is Time Magazine.

4778
04:44:34,549 --> 04:44:42,220
And I was like, and then the text was up here.

4779
04:44:44,060 --> 04:44:45,819
Why don't you just drink it out of the ocean?

4780
04:44:45,819 --> 04:44:49,990
And I was in a magician's outfit with like a tail and a tie.

4781
04:44:50,790 --> 04:45:02,250
Those were some great years.

4782
04:45:02,810 --> 04:45:12,490
Oh, he's a sad one.

4783
04:45:12,490 --> 04:45:13,290
All right, let's move on.

4784
04:45:13,290 --> 04:45:15,529
Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim for the 250.

4785
04:45:15,529 --> 04:45:18,569
That is the, what the God, we gotta start it on that.

4786
04:45:18,569 --> 04:45:20,779
You look like shit, man.

4787
04:45:20,779 --> 04:45:21,259
Yeah, I know.

4788
04:45:23,770 --> 04:45:25,369
I know how bad I look right now.

4789
04:45:25,369 --> 04:45:26,090
You think I don't know that?

4790
04:45:27,799 --> 04:45:30,360
I told you guys before, I gave up like years ago,

4791
04:45:30,360 --> 04:45:32,520
giving a shit about like looking good on camera.

4792
04:45:38,869 --> 04:45:42,709
No, I'm in the virtual world for four and a half hours.

4793
04:45:42,709 --> 04:45:43,349
This is what happens.

4794
04:45:43,990 --> 04:45:46,040
Am I gonna like cut the camera off

4795
04:45:46,040 --> 04:45:47,799
and go get my hair done and then come back and be like,

4796
04:45:49,939 --> 04:45:50,740
why would I be praying?

4797
04:45:51,299 --> 04:45:51,939
I don't know.

4798
04:45:51,939 --> 04:45:52,900
I don't know what that came.

4799
04:45:52,900 --> 04:45:54,340
Why would I have my hands in a prayer?

4800
04:46:01,909 --> 04:46:02,950
Gotta take care of your hair.

4801
04:46:03,830 --> 04:46:06,869
No, well after this, every post VR stream,

4802
04:46:07,430 --> 04:46:10,060
I go into the shower and I condition.

4803
04:46:10,779 --> 04:46:13,900
I let some nice warm water run through it for a little while

4804
04:46:13,900 --> 04:46:15,500
and then I get some nice conditioner,

4805
04:46:16,060 --> 04:46:19,020
let it sit in my hair for about 30 to 45 seconds.

4806
04:46:19,020 --> 04:46:20,060
Let it sit there, hang out.

4807
04:46:21,959 --> 04:46:24,759
I take the shower attachment off,

4808
04:46:25,400 --> 04:46:27,080
get it close and run it through,

4809
04:46:28,779 --> 04:46:32,220
pat, dry it, calm it with a brush and let it just sit there.

4810
04:46:35,779 --> 04:46:36,979
What's my opinion on taking baths?

4811
04:46:36,979 --> 04:46:39,060
I literally took one yesterday

4812
04:46:40,680 --> 04:46:43,479
and I put a turtle bath bomb in.

4813
04:46:44,939 --> 04:46:46,459
It was like a fizzy bath bomb.

4814
04:46:48,020 --> 04:46:48,819
It was wonderful.

4815
04:46:48,819 --> 04:46:49,860
It turned the water green.

4816
04:46:50,419 --> 04:47:02,330
Have you used the frog soap?

4817
04:47:02,330 --> 04:47:02,970
Not yet.

4818
04:47:02,970 --> 04:47:06,169
Frog soap is sitting out on a dish next to the bathtub.

4819
04:47:08,020 --> 04:47:08,740
I don't want to get rid of it.

4820
04:47:08,740 --> 04:47:09,540
I want to keep it there.

4821
04:47:10,740 --> 04:47:11,540
It's a set piece.

4822
04:47:14,139 --> 04:47:15,020
What's your favorite color?

4823
04:47:17,020 --> 04:47:17,500
Blue green.

4824
04:47:25,099 --> 04:47:25,900
Decorative soap.

4825
04:47:25,900 --> 04:47:32,680
Yes, it is.

4826
04:47:32,680 --> 04:47:34,119
You guys don't know what blue green is?

4827
04:47:34,680 --> 04:47:37,419
It's like the halfway point between blue and green.

4828
04:47:41,900 --> 04:47:43,180
Have I ever shit in a bath?

4829
04:47:44,650 --> 04:47:45,689
Yeah, everybody has.

4830
04:47:47,270 --> 04:47:49,669
Probably more than 20 or 30 times.

4831
04:47:49,669 --> 04:47:51,669
Because when you're between the ages of

4832
04:47:53,240 --> 04:47:54,840
three and six months,

4833
04:47:54,840 --> 04:47:56,360
you shit in the bathtub all the time.

4834
04:47:57,080 --> 04:48:00,869
Your parents just didn't tell you that.

4835
04:48:00,869 --> 04:48:05,189
Every single one of you has shit in a bathtub at least 10 times.

4836
04:48:06,200 --> 04:48:06,680
At least.

4837
04:48:19,509 --> 04:48:20,709
I'm not so sure.

4838
04:48:21,349 --> 04:48:22,229
No, of course you did.

4839
04:48:29,139 --> 04:48:31,060
Have I ever shit my pants as an adult?

4840
04:48:31,060 --> 04:48:31,560
Yes.

4841
04:48:34,729 --> 04:48:36,009
Isn't it embarrassing to say that?

4842
04:48:41,340 --> 04:48:46,470
People that tell you they don't believe anybody.

4843
04:48:46,470 --> 04:48:48,229
People pick their nose, they shit their pants,

4844
04:48:48,229 --> 04:48:49,990
they shit in the bathtub, they pee their pants,

4845
04:48:49,990 --> 04:48:52,069
they piss on the wall, they miss the toilet.

4846
04:48:52,069 --> 04:48:52,790
Everybody does this.

4847
04:48:54,500 --> 04:48:55,619
Get rid of the mask.

4848
04:48:55,619 --> 04:48:57,700
Take off the fucking facade here.

4849
04:48:59,750 --> 04:49:01,029
You pee on the seat sometimes.

4850
04:49:01,029 --> 04:49:02,810
You piss in the shower.

4851
04:49:02,810 --> 04:49:04,330
Can we stop this bullshit?

4852
04:49:07,830 --> 04:49:10,869
I don't want to go to Jerma's house.

4853
04:49:10,869 --> 04:49:11,830
It's a very clean house.

4854
04:49:12,549 --> 04:49:33,029
I came in a towel except to clean up after.

4855
04:49:34,220 --> 04:49:34,540
No.

4856
04:49:34,540 --> 04:49:38,860
All jokes aside, I have a very, very nice, well-kept environment.

4857
04:49:39,500 --> 04:49:43,590
Somebody just said something that I have to say out loud.

4858
04:49:43,590 --> 04:49:44,069
No, I'm not.

4859
04:49:44,069 --> 04:49:44,389
It's the one.

4860
04:49:44,389 --> 04:49:45,029
It's in all caps.

4861
04:49:46,090 --> 04:49:47,049
That's unbelievable.

4862
04:49:47,049 --> 04:49:47,930
That's insane.

4863
04:49:48,810 --> 04:49:50,330
I've never even thought about that before.

4864
04:49:50,330 --> 04:49:51,770
That's insanity.

4865
04:49:51,770 --> 04:49:52,810
I'm not going to read it out loud.

4866
04:49:58,439 --> 04:49:58,680
Wow.

4867
04:50:00,540 --> 04:50:01,259
That's so weird.

4868
04:50:01,979 --> 04:50:05,000
What the hell?

4869
04:50:05,000 --> 04:50:05,400
What was that?

4870
04:50:05,400 --> 04:50:06,439
Somebody just tried to post like a...

4871
04:50:07,240 --> 04:50:08,040
What the fuck was that?

4872
04:50:08,680 --> 04:50:09,959
It was in all caps.

4873
04:50:09,959 --> 04:50:10,840
You could just scroll back.

4874
04:50:12,439 --> 04:50:12,759
Thank you.

4875
04:50:12,759 --> 04:50:13,959
Mostly lost for the 250.

4876
04:50:13,959 --> 04:50:15,560
Mindshow should get its own full stream.

4877
04:50:16,200 --> 04:50:17,400
It's VR the movies.

4878
04:50:17,400 --> 04:50:17,639
Yeah.

4879
04:50:18,939 --> 04:50:20,939
I will give Mindshow the time it deserves.

4880
04:50:23,159 --> 04:50:26,040
That's why I haven't really done it yet.

4881
04:50:26,040 --> 04:50:32,220
Because I know I'm certain that I'm not going to want to just jump out of it.

4882
04:50:32,860 --> 04:50:39,080
Somebody already got it.

4883
04:50:39,639 --> 04:50:41,819
But yeah.

4884
04:50:41,819 --> 04:50:43,020
Mindshow will get the time it deserves.

4885
04:50:43,750 --> 04:50:44,470
Eventually here.

4886
04:50:48,119 --> 04:50:48,599
Eventually.

4887
04:50:53,139 --> 04:50:53,779
Thank you.

4888
04:50:53,779 --> 04:50:59,240
Shadow's One Disciple.

4889
04:50:59,959 --> 04:51:02,040
Do not say Shadow's One Discipline.

4890
04:51:02,040 --> 04:51:03,000
There is no end.

4891
04:51:04,419 --> 04:51:06,819
Shadow's One Disciple.

4892
04:51:07,700 --> 04:51:08,740
Thanks for the 250.

4893
04:51:10,259 --> 04:51:12,099
Anyway, I found this in the freezer.

4894
04:51:12,659 --> 04:51:15,400
What is this that you found?

4895
04:51:15,400 --> 04:51:22,459
Grill Master Eight Quarter Pound Patty.

4896
04:51:23,180 --> 04:51:26,020
Have you guys learned nothing from Gordon Ramsay?

4897
04:51:26,979 --> 04:51:31,220
Don't eat frozen patties.

4898
04:51:31,860 --> 04:51:37,189
Grill Master.

4899
04:51:37,830 --> 04:51:41,639
Patty Elitist here.

4900
04:51:52,630 --> 04:51:55,669
I asked you a question but you didn't reply.

4901
04:51:55,669 --> 04:51:56,470
Or other people too.

4902
04:51:56,470 --> 04:52:00,229
Don't ever think you're too Hollywood to reply to me or the people in your chat.

4903
04:52:00,229 --> 04:52:03,430
Never forget you're just a regular average guy who's just good at a video game.

4904
04:52:03,430 --> 04:52:04,389
Get out of your own ass.

4905
04:52:04,950 --> 04:52:07,930
I mean you get the first part there, right?

4906
04:52:07,930 --> 04:52:09,610
I'm not very good at video games though.

4907
04:52:11,500 --> 04:52:12,619
Good at a video game.

4908
04:52:12,619 --> 04:52:22,099
What video game?

4909
04:52:22,099 --> 04:52:23,779
Get out of your own ass.

4910
04:52:23,779 --> 04:52:24,979
I was pretty good in VR.

4911
04:52:25,700 --> 04:52:29,529
You put the patties in your fridge to keep the shape.

4912
04:52:29,529 --> 04:52:30,169
Are you kidding?

4913
04:52:31,590 --> 04:52:31,909
No.

4914
04:52:31,909 --> 04:52:33,430
You get fresh cut.

4915
04:52:34,150 --> 04:52:34,869
Bring it home.

4916
04:52:34,950 --> 04:52:37,779
Immediately cook them.

4917
04:52:37,779 --> 04:52:39,459
Not this re-refrigeration shit.

4918
04:52:40,819 --> 04:52:52,540
Step into the ground beef.

4919
04:52:52,540 --> 04:52:54,919
Can you cook?

4920
04:52:54,919 --> 04:52:55,799
Went to culinary school.

4921
04:52:56,520 --> 04:52:57,560
I think I know a thing or two.

4922
04:52:59,799 --> 04:53:01,720
I mean I'd not like to say that.

4923
04:53:02,439 --> 04:53:06,220
It was a double school.

4924
04:53:06,220 --> 04:53:07,819
It was a culinary clown school.

4925
04:53:08,380 --> 04:53:13,990
The balloon animals we made, we ate them afterwards.

4926
04:53:13,990 --> 04:53:20,389
Balloon chicken.

4927
04:53:22,569 --> 04:53:23,529
Balloon cows.

4928
04:53:23,529 --> 04:53:24,970
Balloon turkeys.

4929
04:53:24,970 --> 04:53:25,610
Balloon snakes.

4930
04:53:32,810 --> 04:53:34,729
Use every part of the balloon animal.

4931
04:53:34,729 --> 04:53:35,130
That's right.

4932
04:53:37,689 --> 04:53:39,209
But thank you, shadows.

4933
04:53:39,450 --> 04:53:40,650
Discycle for the 250.

4934
04:53:42,900 --> 04:53:43,860
Thank you, kimchi.

4935
04:53:43,860 --> 04:53:44,900
Kimchi for the 10 bucks.

4936
04:53:45,700 --> 04:53:46,979
I was broke, now I'm not.

4937
04:53:46,979 --> 04:53:47,700
Here's some money.

4938
04:53:48,259 --> 04:53:49,459
You're the only streamer I watch.

4939
04:53:49,459 --> 04:53:50,900
Thank you for always doing so much for us

4940
04:53:50,900 --> 04:53:51,779
and making the best streams.

4941
04:53:55,189 --> 04:53:55,909
Thank you, kimchi.

4942
04:53:58,119 --> 04:54:01,299
I just aim to have fun.

4943
04:54:02,020 --> 04:54:05,459
Hopefully you guys think the same.

4944
04:54:07,779 --> 04:54:10,970
I'm just trying to have a good time.

4945
04:54:10,970 --> 04:54:11,689
That's all.

4946
04:54:11,689 --> 04:54:14,040
Thank you for the 10 bucks.

4947
04:54:15,990 --> 04:54:18,150
I'm honored to be the only person that you watch.

4948
04:54:18,790 --> 04:54:19,189
Thank you.

4949
04:54:22,650 --> 04:54:23,290
Tingy, thank you.

4950
04:54:23,290 --> 04:54:24,169
Tingy to the 250.

4951
04:54:25,819 --> 04:54:27,580
So James got a kick out of one of your emotes

4952
04:54:27,580 --> 04:54:29,259
after seeing it in his chat.

4953
04:54:29,259 --> 04:54:31,020
I think it's safe to say that he liked it.

4954
04:54:34,069 --> 04:54:34,709
Oh, wait.

4955
04:54:35,270 --> 04:54:35,750
Oh, I see.

4956
04:54:35,750 --> 04:54:36,150
Hold on.

4957
04:54:36,790 --> 04:54:37,509
Can you guys hear that?

4958
04:54:37,509 --> 04:54:40,259
I have to change my desktop audio.

4959
04:54:40,979 --> 04:54:44,810
Let's see if we can hear this now.

4960
04:54:45,450 --> 04:54:46,950
Can we hear this now?

4961
04:54:47,669 --> 04:54:48,389
Yes, we can.

4962
04:54:48,389 --> 04:54:49,750
And that was so loud.

4963
04:54:49,750 --> 04:54:51,029
I'm so sorry again.

4964
04:54:52,069 --> 04:54:52,810
All right, let's see.

4965
04:54:53,450 --> 04:54:53,770
What is it?

4966
04:54:53,770 --> 04:54:54,250
It's a clip.

4967
04:54:57,770 --> 04:54:59,779
What's he playing?

4968
04:55:00,340 --> 04:55:02,040
Metro Exodus.

4969
04:55:03,209 --> 04:55:04,970
Uh, if you haven't played Metro Exodus,

4970
04:55:06,139 --> 04:55:07,819
I might not look at the screen for a little,

4971
04:55:07,819 --> 04:55:09,740
for like 30 to 40 seconds.

4972
04:55:10,860 --> 04:55:11,990
That was way louder.

4973
04:55:11,990 --> 04:55:12,790
He's getting closer.

4974
04:55:13,509 --> 04:55:20,180
He's getting closer.

4975
04:55:20,180 --> 04:55:25,419
Let's see.

4976
04:55:25,419 --> 04:55:27,020
Let's take a look.

4977
04:55:27,020 --> 04:55:31,860
The guy sounds like Willem Dafoe.

4978
04:55:33,459 --> 04:55:34,419
The voice actor.

4979
04:55:35,939 --> 04:55:36,900
Green Goblin, dude.

4980
04:55:48,330 --> 04:55:50,810
Ew, what is that fucking emo, dude?

4981
04:55:50,810 --> 04:55:52,650
Is that a fucking Jerma emo,

4982
04:55:52,650 --> 04:55:54,090
but it's also Willem Dafoe?

4983
04:55:56,090 --> 04:55:57,770
What the fuck is that emo?

4984
04:56:03,369 --> 04:56:04,970
I never would have pieced that together

4985
04:56:04,970 --> 04:56:06,090
that he looks like,

4986
04:56:06,090 --> 04:56:07,290
that he looks like him.

4987
04:56:10,360 --> 04:56:11,479
Oh, that's funny.

4988
04:56:11,479 --> 04:56:17,340
I'm pretty proud of things.

4989
04:56:17,340 --> 04:56:18,619
I'm such a fucking weirdo.

4990
04:56:32,709 --> 04:56:33,349
Thank you for that.

4991
04:56:37,830 --> 04:56:38,790
Well, you are.

4992
04:56:38,790 --> 04:56:42,619
I mean, they're back.

4993
04:56:43,259 --> 04:56:49,459
That person better be like spreading magical cheer

4994
04:56:49,459 --> 04:56:51,220
like Santa Claus shit out their car.

4995
04:56:51,939 --> 04:56:53,860
I will not be upset anymore about this.

4996
04:56:54,419 --> 04:56:56,419
If that guy has like a bag of magic sand

4997
04:56:56,419 --> 04:56:57,139
that he's throwing out

4998
04:56:57,139 --> 04:56:59,380
and it like has good luck charms in it for everybody.

4999
04:57:04,299 --> 04:57:04,939
Every day.

5000
04:57:07,000 --> 04:57:08,119
Uh, Clueless Sniper,

5001
04:57:08,119 --> 04:57:09,720
thanks for the 250.

5002
04:57:10,599 --> 04:57:11,080
250.

5003
04:57:11,720 --> 04:57:14,729
Thanks.

5004
04:57:14,729 --> 04:57:18,060
Uh, thank you also to Strawberry Pulp

5005
04:57:18,700 --> 04:57:21,419
for the 10 bucks.

5006
04:57:21,419 --> 04:57:22,860
10 dollars from Strawberry Pulp.

5007
04:57:23,580 --> 04:57:24,840
This might sound silly,

5008
04:57:24,840 --> 04:57:26,439
but I had kind of a crappy week in this room

5009
04:57:26,439 --> 04:57:27,319
really helped cheer me up.

5010
04:57:27,959 --> 04:57:29,319
Thanks for everything you do.

5011
04:57:29,319 --> 04:57:29,880
Sure my heart.

5012
04:57:33,580 --> 04:57:35,099
I'm sorry you're not having a good week,

5013
04:57:37,060 --> 04:57:39,459
but, uh, as sorry as I am

5014
04:57:39,459 --> 04:57:40,659
that you're not having a good week,

5015
04:57:41,380 --> 04:57:43,830
I am happy that you can come here

5016
04:57:43,830 --> 04:57:44,790
and hang out and have a good time.

5017
04:57:45,799 --> 04:57:48,520
That'll make you possibly not think about any bullshit.

5018
04:57:48,520 --> 04:57:50,900
You know what I mean?

5019
04:57:50,900 --> 04:57:52,259
Thank you for the 10 bucks, Strawberry Pulp.

5020
04:57:59,369 --> 04:57:59,770
Take care.

5021
04:57:59,770 --> 04:58:00,090
Thank you.

5022
04:58:02,779 --> 04:58:03,740
Uh, Growdiv.

5023
04:58:03,740 --> 04:58:05,099
Thank you Growdiv for the five bucks.

5024
04:58:06,389 --> 04:58:08,229
Check out Wildlands 2.

5025
04:58:08,790 --> 04:58:11,110
It has multiplayer and similar vibes to Jet Island,

5026
04:58:11,110 --> 04:58:12,790
but more focused on rope swinging.

5027
04:58:12,790 --> 04:58:13,349
Is it VR?

5028
04:58:13,990 --> 04:58:14,790
I'm assuming it is.

5029
04:58:15,509 --> 04:58:23,139
There's so much VR.

5030
04:58:23,860 --> 04:58:26,020
I've got such a backlog.

5031
04:58:26,020 --> 04:58:27,299
It's, it's overwhelming.

5032
04:58:29,590 --> 04:58:30,310
Windlands.

5033
04:58:30,310 --> 04:58:31,349
No, did I say wild?

5034
04:58:31,349 --> 04:58:32,869
Oh, I said Wildlands.

5035
04:58:33,509 --> 04:58:34,470
Windlands.

5036
04:58:35,189 --> 04:58:36,919
Uh, there I go,

5037
04:58:36,919 --> 04:58:38,599
adding another letter for no reason.

5038
04:58:39,159 --> 04:58:42,819
I still have to go back and beat Jet Island.

5039
04:58:42,819 --> 04:58:43,380
I was close.

5040
04:58:43,380 --> 04:58:45,060
I was only a couple hours away, wasn't I?

5041
04:58:45,860 --> 04:58:55,930
But thank you Growdiv for the five dollars and the suggestion.

5042
04:58:57,270 --> 04:58:58,150
I want to play it all.

5043
04:58:58,150 --> 04:58:58,869
I want to see it all.

5044
04:59:03,080 --> 04:59:04,520
Mostly lost thanks to the 250.

5045
04:59:05,080 --> 04:59:07,500
The stupid shit you and Stir were doing in these games

5046
04:59:07,500 --> 04:59:09,500
reminds me of the shenanigans you two did in TF2

5047
04:59:09,500 --> 04:59:10,380
and it made me happy.

5048
04:59:15,180 --> 04:59:17,939
Yeah, I mean, like I said, anytime you get,

5049
04:59:17,939 --> 04:59:21,080
like, buddy together and you just,

5050
04:59:22,060 --> 04:59:23,979
the purpose is just to have fun.

5051
04:59:25,509 --> 04:59:26,630
There's nothing else there.

5052
04:59:26,630 --> 04:59:30,680
It's just, I want to do something

5053
04:59:30,680 --> 04:59:31,560
and just have a good time.

5054
04:59:31,560 --> 04:59:31,959
That's it.

5055
04:59:32,840 --> 04:59:36,979
It's always, it's always a good time,

5056
04:59:37,619 --> 04:59:40,069
you know, when stars are down.

5057
04:59:40,069 --> 04:59:42,150
You'll see him tomorrow.

5058
04:59:44,099 --> 04:59:46,340
I love beating people at the bar with my buddy.

5059
04:59:47,060 --> 04:59:49,459
I love throwing glass at people's faces,

5060
04:59:49,459 --> 04:59:50,340
you know, with my friend.

5061
04:59:51,220 --> 04:59:52,900
Hitting guitars over people's heads.

5062
04:59:58,709 --> 05:00:00,950
Pretending to smoke the same cigarette

5063
05:00:00,950 --> 05:00:02,709
30 times and burn it on someone.

5064
05:00:02,709 --> 05:00:08,229
Yeah, with a friend.

5065
05:00:08,229 --> 05:00:08,790
It's come on.

5066
05:00:08,790 --> 05:00:09,990
It's just, it's a blast.

5067
05:00:14,150 --> 05:00:15,590
But thank you mostly lost for sure.

5068
05:00:16,150 --> 05:00:19,849
Am I going to want other people

5069
05:00:19,849 --> 05:00:21,689
to join us in Pavlov tomorrow?

5070
05:00:21,689 --> 05:00:22,169
I don't know.

5071
05:00:31,049 --> 05:00:32,009
How big are the lobbies?

5072
05:00:35,099 --> 05:00:36,459
Is it a big lobby system?

5073
05:00:36,459 --> 05:00:37,500
Is it like 12 players?

5074
05:00:37,500 --> 05:00:38,060
How many players?

5075
05:00:39,529 --> 05:00:39,770
10?

5076
05:00:41,580 --> 05:00:42,779
Yeah, maybe we can get something going.

5077
05:00:46,229 --> 05:00:47,669
I'll try to get like one of those

5078
05:00:47,669 --> 05:00:49,750
chat roulette system things.

5079
05:00:50,549 --> 05:00:52,069
Maybe we'll play like a handful of games

5080
05:00:52,069 --> 05:00:53,110
with subs or something.

5081
05:00:53,750 --> 05:00:54,549
That'll be fun.

5082
05:00:57,580 --> 05:00:58,060
I have it.

5083
05:00:58,060 --> 05:00:59,580
If you need a sharpshooter.

5084
05:01:05,240 --> 05:01:06,360
Really loving the VR streams,

5085
05:01:06,360 --> 05:01:07,959
even if I don't chat a lot.

5086
05:01:07,959 --> 05:01:09,580
I'm glad you like them.

5087
05:01:11,240 --> 05:01:11,959
I'm going to keep doing them.

5088
05:01:12,759 --> 05:01:14,119
I'm going to keep doing them

5089
05:01:14,119 --> 05:01:15,560
until I am satisfied.

5090
05:01:16,790 --> 05:01:17,750
And I'm still interested

5091
05:01:17,750 --> 05:01:18,709
and still very satisfied.

5092
05:01:18,709 --> 05:01:23,990
So we're going to keep going chat.

5093
05:01:23,990 --> 05:01:25,029
No, like a chat,

5094
05:01:26,119 --> 05:01:28,360
a roulette based raffle chat system.

5095
05:01:29,080 --> 05:01:33,529
Yeah, we'll have,

5096
05:01:33,529 --> 05:01:35,380
we'll get something going.

5097
05:01:35,380 --> 05:01:36,500
Hey, Novi333.

5098
05:01:36,500 --> 05:01:38,180
Thanks for the 333.

5099
05:01:38,180 --> 05:01:39,610
Free dolls and 33 songs.

5100
05:01:41,240 --> 05:01:41,560
Thank you.

5101
05:01:44,650 --> 05:01:45,369
No message.

5102
05:01:45,369 --> 05:01:45,770
That's it.

5103
05:01:45,770 --> 05:01:46,409
Thank you so much.

5104
05:01:48,759 --> 05:01:49,479
Timmy Tim Tim.

5105
05:01:49,479 --> 05:01:50,279
Thanks for the 250.

5106
05:01:50,919 --> 05:01:51,720
Can you tell the story

5107
05:01:51,720 --> 05:01:52,840
where you ate a pack of Oreos

5108
05:01:52,840 --> 05:01:54,200
and puked in your mother's bed?

5109
05:01:58,279 --> 05:01:59,319
No, isn't there a clip

5110
05:01:59,319 --> 05:02:00,279
lying around somewhere

5111
05:02:01,560 --> 05:02:03,479
from two years ago of me doing this?

5112
05:02:04,119 --> 05:02:05,400
And then didn't I say clip this?

5113
05:02:05,400 --> 05:02:06,599
So anytime anybody says this

5114
05:02:06,599 --> 05:02:07,240
to just to have it.

5115
05:02:07,880 --> 05:02:11,479
I just it's it's somewhere it exists.

5116
05:02:12,279 --> 05:02:16,090
How many times have I had that clipped

5117
05:02:16,090 --> 05:02:17,049
and said, hey, bring this up

5118
05:02:17,049 --> 05:02:18,490
when somebody fucking comes in here

5119
05:02:18,490 --> 05:02:20,650
and it says to give the Oreos.

5120
05:02:20,650 --> 05:02:24,139
Tell the story when you slapped

5121
05:02:24,139 --> 05:02:25,180
yourself in the face live.

5122
05:02:25,819 --> 05:02:27,290
Embarrassment.

5123
05:02:40,939 --> 05:02:41,740
But thank you.

5124
05:02:43,000 --> 05:02:44,279
And I'm going to run the credits.

5125
05:02:44,279 --> 05:02:45,560
We have another couple bits to do,

5126
05:02:45,560 --> 05:02:46,599
but I'm going to preemptively

5127
05:02:46,599 --> 05:02:47,080
get them rolling.

5128
05:02:47,080 --> 05:02:47,799
These are all the subs

5129
05:02:47,799 --> 05:02:49,159
and the resubs that came in today

5130
05:02:49,880 --> 05:02:50,680
during this stream.

5131
05:02:53,080 --> 05:02:54,759
Thank you for the continued support, everybody.

5132
05:02:54,759 --> 05:02:55,319
Means a lot.

5133
05:02:55,319 --> 05:02:55,959
You guys are awesome.

5134
05:02:59,580 --> 05:03:00,700
Thank you, everybody.

5135
05:03:03,799 --> 05:03:06,279
There are trillions of subscribers now.

5136
05:03:16,569 --> 05:03:17,450
I have a game in VR

5137
05:03:17,450 --> 05:03:18,729
that might be Resident Sleeper.

5138
05:03:18,729 --> 05:03:19,290
I don't know.

5139
05:03:19,290 --> 05:03:20,729
It's called Iron Wolf VR.

5140
05:03:22,250 --> 05:03:23,610
That's actually was on the list.

5141
05:03:23,610 --> 05:03:24,330
We were looking at it.

5142
05:03:24,970 --> 05:03:33,340
Sure, but please answer the question.

5143
05:03:34,259 --> 05:03:35,060
Just answer the question.

5144
05:03:35,060 --> 05:03:37,939
But we don't we don't demand things

5145
05:03:37,939 --> 05:03:38,740
from the streamer.

5146
05:03:40,040 --> 05:03:40,759
Exquisite.

5147
05:03:41,400 --> 05:03:55,799
I honestly only come

5148
05:03:55,799 --> 05:03:56,759
for the end of the stream.

5149
05:03:56,759 --> 05:03:58,569
Well, welcome.

5150
05:03:59,380 --> 05:04:00,180
And also goodbye.

5151
05:04:03,799 --> 05:04:04,919
Tingy had 250 here.

5152
05:04:05,720 --> 05:04:07,000
You is the immediate reaction

5153
05:04:07,000 --> 05:04:08,040
to most emotes on Twitch

5154
05:04:08,040 --> 05:04:09,240
that are somewhat distorted.

5155
05:04:09,799 --> 05:04:10,759
I love all you emotes

5156
05:04:10,759 --> 05:04:11,479
because of that reason

5157
05:04:11,479 --> 05:04:12,360
it makes them unique,

5158
05:04:12,360 --> 05:04:13,240
just like you.

5159
05:04:13,240 --> 05:04:13,799
Hey, thank you.

5160
05:04:15,450 --> 05:04:17,049
Now, I'm well aware that my some

5161
05:04:17,049 --> 05:04:18,490
at least half of my emotes

5162
05:04:18,490 --> 05:04:19,290
are dog shit.

5163
05:04:20,860 --> 05:04:21,819
Half those planets

5164
05:04:22,619 --> 05:04:23,740
should have been deleted

5165
05:04:23,740 --> 05:04:24,779
three years ago.

5166
05:04:24,779 --> 05:04:26,299
But no, I'm going to leave them.

5167
05:04:28,889 --> 05:04:29,930
Like German mustard

5168
05:04:29,930 --> 05:04:31,450
is what I would classify

5169
05:04:31,450 --> 05:04:32,889
as a dog shit emo.

5170
05:04:41,659 --> 05:04:42,459
It just is.

5171
05:04:42,459 --> 05:04:43,419
I write you.

5172
05:04:43,419 --> 05:04:43,979
I like it.

5173
05:04:43,979 --> 05:04:45,340
I love all my emotes.

5174
05:04:45,340 --> 05:04:49,659
I have a personal, loving relationship.

5175
05:04:49,659 --> 05:04:51,740
I have a great relationship

5176
05:04:51,740 --> 05:04:52,779
with all my emotes.

5177
05:04:54,779 --> 05:04:55,659
But some of them are

5178
05:04:59,209 --> 05:05:00,490
thrown together, we'll say.

5179
05:05:04,229 --> 05:05:05,669
Flustered because mustard.

5180
05:05:08,779 --> 05:05:10,139
Like, for instance, OK, hold on.

5181
05:05:10,139 --> 05:05:10,779
So for instance,

5182
05:05:11,959 --> 05:05:15,400
German one guy is just a

5183
05:05:15,400 --> 05:05:22,299
just a little shitty paint drawing.

5184
05:05:22,299 --> 05:05:23,340
German nose wipe

5185
05:05:23,340 --> 05:05:25,500
is a terrible dab emote.

5186
05:05:26,569 --> 05:05:27,849
It's a dab emote.

5187
05:05:28,569 --> 05:05:29,610
And it was it was voted

5188
05:05:29,610 --> 05:05:30,409
because of that reason,

5189
05:05:30,409 --> 05:05:32,090
because it's a dab emote.

5190
05:05:32,090 --> 05:05:44,540
German mustard, German moon

5191
05:05:44,540 --> 05:05:46,060
is my first emote ever.

5192
05:05:46,060 --> 05:05:49,099
And it's like I was intentionally

5193
05:05:49,099 --> 05:05:50,139
trying to have an emote

5194
05:05:50,139 --> 05:05:50,779
that was awful.

5195
05:05:52,659 --> 05:05:53,700
I love it, though.

5196
05:05:53,700 --> 05:05:56,540
That's my favorite emote.

5197
05:05:56,540 --> 05:05:58,299
This is by far my favorite emote

5198
05:05:59,110 --> 05:06:00,950
on the site.

5199
05:06:00,950 --> 05:06:01,430
I'm sorry.

5200
05:06:01,430 --> 05:06:01,909
It just is.

5201
05:06:02,470 --> 05:06:04,419
I don't think anybody has

5202
05:06:04,419 --> 05:06:05,540
one that can compare.

5203
05:06:05,540 --> 05:06:08,860
And I'll stand on the

5204
05:06:08,860 --> 05:06:09,979
eagle maniac hill here.

5205
05:06:09,979 --> 05:06:11,900
That's why I love that emo.

5206
05:06:11,900 --> 05:06:14,279
God, what a beautiful emo.

5207
05:06:16,709 --> 05:06:18,389
I say that because it's my face.

5208
05:06:18,389 --> 05:06:18,869
It's me.

5209
05:06:19,669 --> 05:06:23,880
I hope you guys don't

5210
05:06:23,880 --> 05:06:24,840
take me that seriously.

5211
05:06:24,840 --> 05:06:25,479
You definitely don't.

5212
05:06:26,900 --> 05:06:27,459
Timmy, Tim, Tim.

5213
05:06:27,459 --> 05:06:28,180
Thanks for the 250.

5214
05:06:28,180 --> 05:06:29,939
Tell the story so we can clip it.

5215
05:06:29,939 --> 05:06:32,569
Was sick one day.

5216
05:06:32,569 --> 05:06:33,689
Decided to eat Oreos.

5217
05:06:34,819 --> 05:06:35,860
Did the thing where you got up

5218
05:06:35,860 --> 05:06:37,459
and tried to move around

5219
05:06:37,459 --> 05:06:38,580
while being sick to your stomach.

5220
05:06:38,580 --> 05:06:39,380
Got up too fast.

5221
05:06:40,279 --> 05:06:41,159
Had too many Oreos.

5222
05:06:41,159 --> 05:06:41,720
A whole sleeve.

5223
05:06:42,360 --> 05:06:44,069
Wanted to ask my mother

5224
05:06:44,069 --> 05:06:45,509
a question or something.

5225
05:06:45,509 --> 05:06:45,830
I don't know.

5226
05:06:45,830 --> 05:06:47,509
The story is getting hazy

5227
05:06:47,509 --> 05:06:48,310
over all these years.

5228
05:06:48,950 --> 05:06:50,229
It was very fresh in my mind

5229
05:06:50,229 --> 05:06:51,750
when I told it the first time.

5230
05:06:51,750 --> 05:06:52,790
So go up to my mother

5231
05:06:52,790 --> 05:06:53,590
to ask a question.

5232
05:06:53,590 --> 05:06:55,110
Get that closed in.

5233
05:06:55,110 --> 05:06:56,310
The world's going to fall down

5234
05:06:56,310 --> 05:06:57,349
on top of you.

5235
05:06:57,349 --> 05:06:59,209
Blackout feeling.

5236
05:06:59,209 --> 05:07:00,889
Lie back in my mother's bed

5237
05:07:00,889 --> 05:07:02,650
and throw up all over it.

5238
05:07:02,650 --> 05:07:07,259
The whole sleeve.

5239
05:07:07,259 --> 05:07:08,060
No, no, no.

5240
05:07:08,060 --> 05:07:08,939
Like one of the.

5241
05:07:08,939 --> 05:07:10,619
This is like this three sleeves

5242
05:07:10,619 --> 05:07:12,060
per Oreo container.

5243
05:07:15,139 --> 05:07:18,099
One of those sections.

5244
05:07:18,099 --> 05:07:21,220
Probably 12 to 14 cookies.

5245
05:07:21,220 --> 05:07:24,409
Why did you eat Oreos

5246
05:07:24,409 --> 05:07:24,970
if you were sick?

5247
05:07:24,970 --> 05:07:25,369
I don't know.

5248
05:07:28,069 --> 05:07:30,069
Why does anybody ever eat Oreos?

5249
05:07:30,069 --> 05:07:31,299
For any reason.

5250
05:07:31,860 --> 05:07:33,990
Can you guys reliably

5251
05:07:33,990 --> 05:07:34,709
think of a scenario

5252
05:07:34,709 --> 05:07:36,310
where eating like a bunch of Oreos

5253
05:07:36,310 --> 05:07:36,869
is a good idea?

5254
05:07:39,990 --> 05:07:41,029
They just taste good.

5255
05:07:41,669 --> 05:07:49,959
And they're easy to eat.

5256
05:07:49,959 --> 05:07:51,000
Oreos are great.

5257
05:07:51,000 --> 05:07:51,479
Fuck you.

5258
05:07:52,200 --> 05:07:53,240
I also agree.

5259
05:07:53,240 --> 05:07:54,759
I think Oreos are fantastic.

5260
05:07:59,479 --> 05:08:00,439
But if like you.

5261
05:08:00,439 --> 05:08:02,040
The light bulb goes off like.

5262
05:08:03,509 --> 05:08:04,869
I'm going to eat 12 Oreos.

5263
05:08:06,979 --> 05:08:08,659
It's never really a great idea.

5264
05:08:14,540 --> 05:08:16,700
Oreo serving size is three.

5265
05:08:16,700 --> 05:08:18,139
You're eating 30 times

5266
05:08:18,139 --> 05:08:18,939
the serving size.

5267
05:08:21,049 --> 05:08:21,770
Hey, Kirby Heart.

5268
05:08:21,770 --> 05:08:23,430
Thanks for the four dollars.

5269
05:08:23,430 --> 05:08:25,110
Thanks for streaming on my birthday.

5270
05:08:25,189 --> 05:08:26,069
Love your streams.

5271
05:08:26,069 --> 05:08:26,790
Happy birthday.

5272
05:08:27,529 --> 05:08:28,250
Kirby, thank you.

5273
05:08:30,860 --> 05:08:31,659
Kirby Heart.

5274
05:08:31,659 --> 05:08:35,270
Did you ever replace her bed after that?

5275
05:08:35,270 --> 05:08:37,029
No, we just sprayed it a shitload with a hose

5276
05:08:37,029 --> 05:08:37,830
and then let it dry

5277
05:08:37,830 --> 05:08:38,549
and then flipped it over.

5278
05:08:43,860 --> 05:08:52,409
And that's my time.

5279
05:08:52,409 --> 05:08:53,290
That's going to be it for me.

5280
05:08:54,009 --> 05:09:01,479
Cliff both parts.

5281
05:09:05,110 --> 05:09:06,150
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5282
05:09:07,430 --> 05:09:08,310
Have a great night.

5283
05:09:13,590 --> 05:09:14,090
Now.

5284
05:09:15,189 --> 05:09:17,029
Now half of you go to Nova

5285
05:09:17,029 --> 05:09:18,630
and half of you go to Italics.

5286
05:09:18,630 --> 05:09:19,689
Those are the only two people

5287
05:09:19,689 --> 05:09:21,290
that are streaming right now that I see.

5288
05:09:22,090 --> 05:09:25,500
Go say hello.

5289
05:09:25,500 --> 05:09:31,299
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5290
05:09:31,299 --> 05:09:34,340
Bright and early at like 330, 4 p.m. Pacific.

5291
05:09:39,689 --> 05:09:40,569
Take care, guys.
