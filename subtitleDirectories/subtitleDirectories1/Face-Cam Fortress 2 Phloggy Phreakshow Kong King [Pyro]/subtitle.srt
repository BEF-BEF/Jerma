1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,259
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition,

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:19,579
for people on the point right now. We're gonna take care of that right now. Oh, did that

3
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:26,449
hit anybody? Apparently not. Come on, get lit. Playing as the Pyro with the Scorch Shot,

4
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,210
as you can see on the screen, the Flowgestinator, Flowgeistinator, however you want to pronounce

5
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,310
that freaky weapon, and the Neon Annihilator, trying to get a little interesting setup going

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,700
here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, lag. What the hell was that? Trying to get an interesting setup.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,649
I'll explain it in a second once I have a second here. Oh, come here. Oh, oh, oh, flug.

8
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:01,420
Oh, where are they? Where are they? Where are these rat bastards? Oh, sneak attack, baby.

9
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:16,260
Oh, boy. Maybe not. Oh, crits. Oh, hey, how you doing? Oh, my God, it's chaos. This is

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:29,829
absolute chaos. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dude, dude, this is chaos. I just killed like nine

11
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:40,760
people. Okay, so let me... Oh, heal me, please. Let me try and explain what I was trying to

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:48,409
say in the very beginning. Oh, my God. This weapon is such a goofy weapon. I always forget.

13
00:01:49,349 --> 00:02:01,659
Come here. Oh, get... Well, that was absolutely insane. Let's do this. So what I wanted to talk

14
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,539
about in this video has to do with the scorch shot and the flow-gistinator. Whoa, I just like

15
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,539
freaked myself out right there. It has to do with the combination of these two items and how they

16
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,830
can be very, very good when used together. Now, that can be said about the detonator as well,

17
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,870
but I feel like with the detonator, you do more damage, but you still have to detonate it.

18
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,889
And I'm one of those people that I like all the stuff done for me. So it's detonating it by itself

19
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,490
when you knock into somebody or when you hit a ground, and plus it knocks people away too.

20
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,729
And I was a very, very big advocate of somebody that was against this item when it released,

21
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,210
and I'm starting to have second thoughts about it. I think this could really be an interesting

22
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,460
item when you use it in the right situations. But we are back here now at their spawn,

23
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:56,300
and let's see if we can't be a real, real bastard here. So you know what? They're all out there. I

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,830
might as well just go to this. No, I'm not going to, I'm not going to hang out here.

25
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,810
Let's go up to where they are. Oh my God. Come to Papa.

26
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,219
That's the music I want playing when I have the plug detonator up.

27
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,870
When I do the crits, that's the song I want playing.

28
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,580
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. If only I had custom sounds.

29
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,860
All right, get on that point. We're already on it. Oh, they got a sentry.

30
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:45,180
That's not cool. That is not cool, man. Click, click, click, click, click. Boom. Boom. I love

31
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,060
the sound this thing makes too. It's so awesome. Also using the neon annihilator. I almost said

32
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,060
lionator. I've been watching too much Game of Thrones. He's a lion. He's a Lannister.

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh, that was pretty sweet shot. Just defend the point. Keep the point defended until King Kong

34
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:12,539
and Godzilla come have like an epic battle. Come here. Yeah, you can blast me around all you want.

35
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:22,949
It's still going to be a firefight, bro. Damn. Damn. Not good. Not good. Where are you going,

36
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:29,110
man? Pyro versus Pyro. Come on. That's what it's all about. Damn. I got to get that hit.

37
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,029
I got to hit somebody with this. Damn. Come on. I got to get to somebody live with this thing.

38
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:39,529
Oh my God. Why can I not hit anybody? I don't know where the health packs are.

39
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:45,399
Oh, you son of a... I was going to light that guy on fire from behind,

40
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,370
activate my crits while he activated his crits. Man, that was going to be crit-ception.

41
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:01,779
It just didn't happen. Damn. It's all right. They're going to win. Just run. Just barrel

42
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:10,410
right through. Oh, this guy had the same idea. I need a medic. I need a medic. Where are you going?

43
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:19,639
What? I thought that was a spy that backstabbed me. I got like launched. Wow. Good show, bro. Good

44
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:27,750
show. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, King Kong. I want to activate my King Kong powers

45
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,389
and have them drop from the ceiling. Why am I looking at my actual ceiling? Instead of looking

46
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:38,329
up like this, I looked over at my actual ceiling when I said that. Let me get an overheal. All

47
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:44,540
right. We can't... They can't just take this from us like this. Time to activate the flog rage.

48
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:58,540
Oh, rage. We got it. Damn. I got to hit him. Oh my God. I can't even air blast that either.

49
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:07,850
I got to work on my skill here. Finally. There we go. Knock him around. Now he's going to run.

50
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:18,810
He's going to think I'm going to chase him. I'm not. This is so stupid. Oh my God. I'm going to

51
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:28,709
run out of bullets. Okay. Now I have to... Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Did he just blow himself

52
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:36,139
up? I think he just blew himself up. Oh, crits. Crits everywhere. I'm holding down the button. I

53
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:43,509
don't know where anybody is. Come here. Dude, this is ridiculous. I love this. It's so goofy.

54
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:52,089
Come on. We got to hold him. We got to hold him. This guy won't die. Oh, somebody on it. Somebody

55
00:06:52,089 --> 00:07:01,029
on it. Knock him off. This is it. Oh my God. This is going to come down to the wire. Oh, oh,

56
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:16,300
no. Oh, this is bad. Get him off. Oh, good game. Good font game guys. I'll take that loss. That was

57
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:26,060
a close game. Over time, over time. Holy crap. Let's do another one. Nobody, nobody. Engineer on here

58
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,779
would be really fun. Whoa. My God. Where did that guy come from? That guy just like launched out of

59
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:41,899
nowhere. Oh, no. This is bad. Oh, this is bad. Get one of them. Get this other guy too. Did you see

60
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,459
that medic though? That was crazy. That medic just like appeared right in front of my face.

61
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:57,160
He must've jumped down from the balcony. Respawn. Man, my whole body hurts right now. Every time I

62
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,670
move my arms, my whole body hurts because I was at the gym and I went... Oh my God. I'm

63
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:09,420
going to get beat right here. Oh, nice shot. That was like a little pellet shot. But anyways,

64
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,740
yeah. Whenever I do this, I got back to the gym. And if you remember old, old, old German channel,

65
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,699
I used to go to the gym all the time. I used to go to the gym literally... We were getting spawn

66
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,819
camped. Literally every day I would go to the gym and I... That hasn't been happening lately. I've

67
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:30,569
been going to the gym like once every like three months and I really want to change that.

68
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,779
So I went back the other day and if you don't go to the gym for a while after going for a long time,

69
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:45,080
every... Why am I not... What was just going on right there? I was holding it on their backs.

70
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:53,460
My ping is 11. What? But anyways, when you go to the gym, if you haven't gone for a long time,

71
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:00,230
your whole body hurts. I did curls and I seriously feel like I want to die right now. Let me get some

72
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,389
heals, man. Let me get some of those. Let me get some of those beautiful heals. Whoa. Please heal

73
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:13,110
me. Oh my God. Oh my God, man. Oh my God. I'm stuck right here. I need to get like one hit on

74
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:22,580
somebody. Geez. There it is. There it is. That's what I wanted. Get rid of this. Oh yeah.

75
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,509
That was beautiful. That was so lucky, man. I can't believe I did not die from that. Same with

76
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:40,100
that. I should have bled to death right there. No, this is where we go down. Oh, so much stress.

77
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:50,870
Hi. How are you doing? My name is Joma. What's your name? Oh God. Night of Purgatory. Interesting

78
00:09:50,870 --> 00:10:05,860
name. Very interesting. Dr. Pepper. Dr. Pepper. Oh, you make the world taste better. Remember

79
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:14,340
that jingle? 30 seconds. We're going to lose. Come on, guys. I have faith. The Flawgistinator

80
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:24,259
has faith. Damn. Oh, he's. No. All right. 50s. I got to change to something else. Boy, before pyros.

81
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,269
Soldier. Soldier with whatever. That's fine. I'm just going to like rocket jump over there.

82
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:39,080
Come on. Oh, we're going to get it. Teleporter. Where's it going to take me? Come on. There we go.

83
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,429
Get me over there. Oh, that was a bad rocket jump. And so is that. What did I hit the ceiling?

84
00:10:46,230 --> 00:11:03,539
Oh, God. Fantastic. Just got it. Oh, get them off. Covet and P. Why am I doing that? I should

85
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:13,179
just shoot. Oh, they have a sentry too. You know, back to pyro. No, stay soldier. I don't know what

86
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:19,690
to do. I'm so scared right now because they only have one second. No, I'm staying soldier.

87
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm going to stay soldier right now. Level one. Not worth the wait. They have one second.

88
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:42,649
Get me over there. Hey, hello, Mr. Spy. Hello. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wow. He could have

89
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:51,210
just won that. I fell down the stairs. Oh, man. Maybe I should have like not picked up. No,

90
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,730
this is bad. Scout. Scout. I'm just like being an idiot with the soldier right now. Let's just

91
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:04,519
regular scatter gun guillotine. I didn't like relax. I'm going crazy. I'm just so scared of that one

92
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:20,169
second. We're okay now. We're okay now. See if I can guillotine some mother effer. Oh, sister lag.

93
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:41,299
Just hit that into a wall apparently. Two scouts, two scouts. Oh, what do we got? What do we got?

94
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:50,070
Oh, you son of a. You son of a. Hey, I'm not really doing a whole lot, but my team is

95
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,269
really pulling through right here. Maybe I could even go back to pyro. No,

96
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,000
it's going to be five pyros on the team if I do that. We'll stick with this.

97
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:09,480
We'll stick with this for the last 30 seconds. Why not? Let me just scoop somebody up with this.

98
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:28,809
Come on. And nope. Shoot him in his face. Oh my God. So the last like two and a half minutes,

99
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:34,860
I think I've killed one person and I've just been like jumping around like a freak. Hey,

100
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,950
whatever works, right? I think that's going to be it. Hey, we did it. Ghost buster. Third place as

101
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,629
the scout, except that didn't really happen at all. But yeah, that's going to wrap things up,

102
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,870
guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next

103
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,529
time. And of course, take care everybody. This is going to grow from here to here. That's a lie.

104
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,610
I would never get that up that big.
