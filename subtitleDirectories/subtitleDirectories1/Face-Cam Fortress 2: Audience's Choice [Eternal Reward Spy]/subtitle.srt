00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,339
Hey, yo, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.

2
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,399
See if I can't hop over and kill this scout from behind to get my first disguise with

3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:29,050
the Eternal Reward. Oh my god, I'm like burping and stabbing. Stab! Stab! Playing as the spy

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,170
as you can tell. With the, I'll show you the loadout because the loadout is actually pretty

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,219
important thing to talk about. The Diamondback, the Eternal Reward, and the Cloak in Dagger.

6
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:46,539
This was picked by the live stream last night during my choose your own adventure polling

7
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,780
live stream, which was actually pretty fun. I can't wait to do that again because there's

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,140
more interesting things that could be done. But let's get right into this here. Let's

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:04,510
see if we can't. Give me another one. Oh, what? He died before I could kill him. Here's the

10
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:11,500
good thing about the Cloak in Dagger. Ready? You can just sit here. I love it. I can make

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,989
a sandwich. I can drink some Dr. Pepper. I had an opportunity to kill that Pyro, but

12
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:23,680
you know what? Sometimes Dr. Pepper is more important. How come I didn't? Oh, that's right.

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,099
You can't run over ammo and get refilled. Yeah! Give me the health. Health. Health. Health.

14
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,489
Maybe the doctor can heal me. Thank you, doctor. Why did I pick up that health? That was a

15
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:39,939
bad move. So I want to talk about Dr. Pepper for a second because it's kind of a split.

16
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,150
There's a 50-50 split between people liking Dr. Pepper and people hating Dr. Pepper. Now

17
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,150
I'm one of those people that, as you can tell, absolutely loves the soft drink. And no,

18
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,090
I'm not being paid by them. I wish I was. That would be pretty cool if it was like,

19
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,569
hey, Jerma, we're Dr. Pepper. We know you love our drinks. We're going to give you a

20
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:04,980
thousand cases of Dr. Pepper. I'd be like, shine me up, dude. But that's probably never

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,539
going to happen. So that's wishful thinking. But if you think a couple of people in the

22
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,460
comments said, Jerma, I hate Dr. Pepper and I hope you don't hate me. No, no, no. I know

23
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,389
that it's a very, it's a very polarizing soda. And I've just been walking around in circles.

24
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:29,710
No, I'm real. Look, see, I'm real. Nice job, scout. Nice job. High five. If I had the high

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,830
fives on, I would just use it right there. But Dr. Pepper, best drink ever in my opinion. And

26
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,259
well, we're going to win this. They can't even get on the point. Damn. Maybe I should switch

27
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:50,340
teams. No, I'll stay here for now. That's just, I just knocked this guy off. Gotcha. Come on.

28
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,479
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Are you seeing this? Heavy, heavy, heavy. Face

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:08,020
stab. Diamondback is not a great option here because there's no engineers early on the other

30
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:16,539
team. I'll take that though. I'll take that. Let's try and hide somewhere. Whoa. Is that real? Did

31
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:21,300
I make it to my own spawn? I'm like, Oh, I'm at their spawn. I'm not even. Yeah, I made it to my

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:29,819
own spawn. Hey, look at that. My own spawn. Hey, spawn. Two, three. So let's do another round.

33
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:38,050
All right. So we change maps. We end up on nucleus. That's okay with me. I thought that guy was

34
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,500
going to jump down. I got him regardless. It's okay. No, no, I just got a disguise. Oh, button

35
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,659
buddy. Bonzi buddy. Does anybody remember Bonzi buddy? That's a very old internet term. I'm not

36
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:58,960
sure if any of you guys might remember that old school, like 56 K 28.8 K dial up users will know

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:07,840
who Bonzi buddy is. Oh, there's a mini century now. Eternal reward is going to be not so good.

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:19,800
But if I can come here, you got him. He had crits too. He's going to be really mad. That is

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,500
definitely a spy. I could probably guess. Now he probably thinks I'm a spy. Spies everywhere.

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:34,540
Spyception. All right. Got my gunslinger out. Let's do this boys. Gunslinger. Hey scout, come

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,810
back here. I want to talk to you for a sec. Hey scout, I want to talk to you too. Oh, okay. I was

42
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:50,439
going to say that made the stabbing noise. That guy. It's okay. Run. Everybody's chasing.

43
00:04:50,439 --> 00:05:01,149
Everybody's chasing. Jeez. I have an opportunity here. No, it's okay. Now I have an opportunity.

44
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:10,779
Oh, this. No. Get the hells. Get the. All right. Both my fingers just almost went up my nose. I

45
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:17,019
almost just freaked out. I almost went. That would have been bad. That would have not made for a good

46
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:24,139
face cam video. Maybe it would have. You know, who knows? All right. We're going to get. That's a

47
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:36,269
spy. At least I got his disguise. Hey, how are you? How's the wife and kids? Now would be a pretty

48
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:43,980
good time to utilize the diamond back. Never. I will never get it. I will never get a stair stab.

49
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:57,529
I probably should have waited a little longer. Oh. The unwanted FX. The X edition. Let's go.

50
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:05,939
Let's respawn. I'm going to go down here this time because the left area is giving me a little bit

51
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:16,899
of trouble. Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody. A lot of people here. Here's the only chance I'm

52
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:22,149
going to get. I don't want him to put another sentry down. Wait till this pyro gets out of here.

53
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:29,980
I'm doing a whole lot of sitting still here. Here it is. Three in a row right here. One, two,

54
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:42,680
three. Now here's the question. Can I get. Oh, I thought that was a sticky from the other team.

55
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,410
Oh, I wanted to get that. Hi. How are you? I'm probably disguised as you. Totally. Yeah, I am.

56
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,009
No, there's nothing I can do. Nothing I can do. Try and make the jump. Make the jump. Oh. Did he

57
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:09,620
follow me? He did. He followed me. Oh, God. That was a lot of luck in that came into play. I need

58
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:21,990
the health now. Hoo. Boy, oh boy. That is a spy scout. If I've ever seen one in my life. No,

59
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:32,089
I thought he just jumped to his own death. Does he have the. He might have the. No, he's not real.

60
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,680
You know what? I will accept that death because I got killed by Marlon Brando 57. Marlon Brando. M

61
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:53,300
Brando. I love that name. Now here's the funny thing. His name might be like Matt Brandio,

62
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:02,459
not Marlon Brando, but that's what I saw. We better get him off of this. No, I can't go over

63
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:13,699
there. Minicentury. Curse you. Curse you, Minicentury. They're gonna get it. I do not approve of that.

64
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:31,560
Get the scout right here. No, get him. Gonna get a crit. I'll take a crit. Somebody come out of the

65
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,269
spawn. Let's end this. Oh, it's gonna end it right there. Might as well just use it up because I'm

66
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:46,120
gonna die anyways. And we got it anyways, right? Right? Right? Oh, yeah. All right. That's gonna

67
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:54,309
wrap it up. Thank you so much for watching, guys. I really appreciate it. And cheers. Cheers, mate.

68
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,350
See you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
