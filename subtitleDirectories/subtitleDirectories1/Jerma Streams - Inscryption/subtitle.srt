1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:12,220
My mic wasn't plugged in. I hope it sounds okay, because it was not plugged in. And I just jammed

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,539
it in and pressed start now. Why was this not plugged in? I was sitting there going,

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:35,899
why can't I not hear anything? Stream sucks. Hi guys. How you doing? Welcome back. Somebody said,

4
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:44,570
we can only be so patient, Andy. Are you talking about me? We can wait, are you talking about you?

5
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:52,119
You're the, we can only be so patient, Andy. Or are you calling me Andy? Like we can only be so

6
00:00:52,119 --> 00:01:01,369
patient, Andy. I'm trying. What does that one mean? Hey, what's up green? Oh, I just dropped that.

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:12,519
I'm fine. Promise us you won't be late next time. I'm late every single time. But here's the thing.

8
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,200
Look, it's time for defense. It's time for defense. When my stream turns on, I'm here.

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:35,540
It's like, boom. Data goes in. 30 seconds later. What's up? I don't got a 20 minute countdown.

10
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,849
I don't have a 10 to 15 minute countdown on screen. I don't have a 30 minute countdown.

11
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:52,010
I'm here and I'm ready when I press that button. See? That's true. What's your point?

12
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:03,420
You can't true me and then say, you can't true me and then say, what's the point? I like this method.

13
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:16,979
I'm here and I'm ready. True but not based. Is that possible? How does that work? You could be true

14
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:25,930
but not based. Is that how that works? Who makes these rules, by the way? Anyways, today we're

15
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,699
going to play Inscription. It's the, that scary card game that I've heard all about. Seems pretty

16
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,250
crazy. I don't know anything about it besides it exists. And I know that I'm kind of late to the

17
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,979
party here, but that's good for you because you get to see all the funny moments when I get scared

18
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,300
by the cards that pop out and jump scare me or something because you've played this game.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,030
And we're starting late today. Well, I told you we're going to stream maybe on Monday or Tuesday.

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,610
So here we are on Monday. I had stuff to do earlier this afternoon, but I'm here now.

21
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:13,210
Also going to be live tomorrow too and make that clear. So they'll be streamed tomorrow.

22
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,449
I want to do, there's a few things that are going to happen here over the next couple of days.

23
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,289
I want to make it very clear what the kind of plan is. I'll reiterate it a little bit later, but

24
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:37,800
Ludwig and I want to do that Elden Ring PvP kind of community champions night. So I am going to do

25
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,729
in the next day or so, we're going to do Elden Ring PvP again. And I've got to find my champions

26
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:58,629
because I'm not fighting Ludwig. We're picking champions. So I got to make sure I get the right

27
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:06,789
ones. Yeah, I already know a few. I already know a few that I need to find and get, you know,

28
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:15,590
find them. But maybe not. Maybe tomorrow or Wednesday. I'm not sure yet. I'll figure it out.

29
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:27,860
But I am holding what is essentially tryouts. We're going to see if we can make it work.

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:45,939
Do an IRL Elden Ring stream or just like dodge roll stuff. You know, actually kind of funny.

31
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,509
But don't like one guy me and make me like, go get like sponsors and make me spend

32
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,959
fucking hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up like I'm doing like I'm going to I'm

33
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,399
like in a Dark Souls dungeon, like going and picking up items and have to dodge roll shit.

34
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,670
Don't I don't you're going to make me you're going to make me go do that.

35
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:19,779
Are you going to make me do that? Like I then there's a boss at the end that I have to fight

36
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:39,050
and I die like fucking 50 times. That's so stupid. No one's forcing you. It would be a LARP.

37
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:45,060
I'd have to get I'd have to go and get the shortcut and stuff. Would that even

38
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:55,540
last more than like an hour? Have like two or three bosses and have like a main boss at the end.

39
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:05,660
I would want to include chat somehow, though, and just train and do do animations as a person

40
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:20,470
in real life. Have idle animations, LARP stream, IRL fall joke. Yeah, I walk off a cliff and fucking

41
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:34,680
die. A little fake, but you know, just sit there and chug and estus and then get killed in one hit.

42
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,839
OK, all right. Well, here's the thing. I'm going to write this down because this is this is really

43
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:53,769
stupid and I kind of I kind of want to like explore this a little bit and be in full armor.

44
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:08,579
This would be oh, this is going to be fucking a little hard, though, but our chat will spawn

45
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:22,839
enemies. Oh, good. You haven't started yet. I was heating up my. Yeah, this is going to be expensive.

46
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:32,939
Whatever I the cost of a show does not bother me. It's being able to actually pay for it.

47
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:40,009
I'll actually be able to dodge IRL and I'm going to tell these actors are going to be like fucking

48
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,480
try to hit me with that axe. I'm not kidding. I don't want this to be like, oh, we're actors.

49
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,120
Oh, I'm like swinging really slowly. No, try to fucking hit me with that axe and I'm going

50
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:58,730
to dodge it. You know what I mean? Like I got to go all in. Not a real axe. No, not

51
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:08,180
not a real axe, guys. I'm saying I will. Maybe I like foam or something, whatever it is.

52
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:15,050
But I want that person. I want it to be. I don't want to be like, oh, I'm swinging and you're going

53
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,889
to put your hand up and block it. And I know you are. So we're both going to go two miles per hour.

54
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,730
And pretend to hit each other. No, I want this to look fucking crazy. I want it to look good.

55
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,430
I want that actor to fucking try to hit me as hard as he can. I'm going to take that actor aside

56
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,909
and be like, hey, what's up, man? Um, this little this foam thing, like keep practice. Just hit me

57
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,710
like in the back with it like five times. It's going to be like, that doesn't hurt. That doesn't

58
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,029
hurt that much. All right. I want you to hit me in the head. And I mean, like, I'm going to be

59
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:54,500
dodging it. It's going to be real. I'm method acting. This shit's going to be made out of like

60
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,419
fucking pillows and foam, guys. We're going to make sure that doesn't hurt. We're going to make

61
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:09,830
sure it's like it's like getting hit by air. Jack gets to choose the stats you level up. Well,

62
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:18,759
they can't. I don't think sorcery could exist. Don't worry. He's an expert at hand to hand combat.

63
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:28,309
I'm not. What about lightning bolts? I mean, I could get, I guess we could make it interesting.

64
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:40,070
Fireworks. Casting one glint stone bolt at somebody and I have to light up like a Roman

65
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,429
candle or something. No, that's not. I'm not shooting. That's dangerous. I don't want to do

66
00:09:43,429 --> 00:10:03,240
that. I'm not doing anything that could actually hurt anybody. We'll figure it out. Use a flashlight.

67
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,080
That would actually be kind of funny. Well, like a little pretend like,

68
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,860
yeah, I actually kind of like this idea. And here's the problem, though. This is the bad part.

69
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:25,450
This was a great idea six months ago. So a week or two after Elden Ring came out, I could do this

70
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:32,759
stream. This is now going to be about four to six months of planning. And Elden Ring is going to

71
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:40,389
kind of be in the rear view for a lot of people, I think, in a year. It doesn't have to be like a

72
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,149
from software kind of parody. It's just an action adventure dungeon that is very heavily inspired

73
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:55,139
by Dark Souls. All right, I'm writing it down. I actually am. I'm actually writing it down

74
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:02,419
because this could be like fun. Bringing a bunch of set designers and make a Dark Souls dungeon.

75
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:13,320
This is actually, yeah, I think I could make this work. All right. See you in like a year

76
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,960
when the guy in chat goes, hey, I said IRL Elden Ring. And and he spent $400,000 on a stream.

77
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:50,179
You thank that guy. All right. So anyways, we're going to get into inscription. IRL

78
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,139
millennia. It actually would be so funny if I kept dying to a boss and I was just

79
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:03,139
yelling into the camera, like talking shit to the camera. Like this is fucking bullshit.

80
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:08,100
This boss sucks. That mechanic is absolutely broken. I complained for like 10 minutes into

81
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,059
the camera. And then like while I'm complaining, I'm backing up and I just drop like off the cliff

82
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:23,080
and it says like you died. Oh, this could be good. Oh, this could be very good. I'm actually really

83
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:38,340
into this. All right, I'm not gonna tell you anything else. Can you help me with my chemistry

84
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,909
homework? No, I don't really know anything about chemistry. Okay, inscription. Here it is.

85
00:12:48,659 --> 00:13:02,730
Let's do it. Hi. So how does this game work? It's a scary game. This is a scary game. I get

86
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:13,419
the Pac-Man shirt on it. All right. This is a scary game. Lights off. It's it's not dark yet.

87
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:39,639
The lights aren't even like on. This is not a lights off game. Don't do that. It's a PC.

88
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:53,820
This is an old PC. I'm sorry. That was fucking horrible. Inscription. Turn the lights up. I'm

89
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:01,750
not I can't turn the lights off. I'm not stealing this from like XQC's community. Okay. Like, oh,

90
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:24,120
lights off. Oh, I love that guy. Yeah. Oh, yep. Oh, cool. See, I do too. This makes me look weird.

91
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,299
Cat. This is not a lights off game. Is that my? Okay, whatever. Okay. New game options.

92
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:36,379
Do I turn anything up or down? What should I do here? Flicker FX. Nope. Screen shake. No,

93
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:43,509
thank you. Tech speed. That's probably fine. Noise effect. Turn that off. Full screen, please. And

94
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,470
let's get it on ultra brightness. Turn the brightness up a little bit so it's not so dark.

95
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:58,580
What do you mean why? I don't like when any of that shit is in my games. No, I don't like it. I

96
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:09,110
don't like when anything's like put screen shake on maximum. All right. Music volume. I always turn

97
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,919
it down. That should be fine. Like that. Turn the noise back on. All right. I'm going to turn the

98
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:27,370
noise back on. If I don't like it, it's going off immediately. Okay, let's go. Like I can't start a

99
00:15:27,370 --> 00:16:01,340
new game. Why? Continue. I haven't played this. I haven't played this game. A little challenger.

100
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,379
It has been ages.

101
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:08,419
Voice acting.

102
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:17,590
Does it matter where?

103
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,580
So I have to... Okay.

104
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,980
Okay, this is one attack, three health.

105
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:49,110
Unopposed.

106
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,799
Yeah, okay. Just like Hearthstone.

107
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:20,859
Like this. My turn. Okay, your stoat stands in the way of my coyote. Two. All right, so I live.

108
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:28,140
My coyote took two damage to your stoat. That means your stoat's health is two less. How come

109
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
that didn't kill it? These aren't Hearthstone rules.

110
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:47,059
Your turn. You may draw from your deck or you may draw a squirrel. Which doesn't matter.

111
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:54,230
Again, I'm going to draw a squirrel. How dull. Well, no, because if I played the squirrel,

112
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:02,339
then the wolf can come up and sacrifice two people. Okay, so let's put a squirrel out there.

113
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:12,970
And then I'm going to play the wolf right here. Drop the wolf down. Suffering. Suffering was real,

114
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:24,460
but you will see it again. Okay, got the wolf out. That's it, right? Because you are learning,

115
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,230
I will pass. Again, the choice. A random card from your deck or the certainty of a squirrel.

116
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:43,029
Let me just take a random card. A river snapper. Can I see what it does? I can't do anything.

117
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:55,880
Oh, shit. Three weights on the scale. Pass. Squirrel. Put squirrel out. Back it up. Pass.

118
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:10,730
I win. I won this match. They won't all be so easy. Let me recall your story. Oh, yes.

119
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:25,700
Pale blood, you say. You were lost deep in the forest. A single path revealed itself.

120
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:33,450
Two denizens of the forest approached you tentatively. Okay. A cat. The undying cat

121
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:41,700
sacrificing the poor beast does not kill it. A caustic adder. Damage from its poison bite

122
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:57,700
is always lethal. Only one may grace your paltry deck. Snake or cat. I feel like the adder. Everyone's

123
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,779
saying cat. Is it cat? I thought I would assume it would be snake. Oh, there's only one sacrifice

124
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:23,109
needed. Turn the music up. This is gonna go, dude. I'll take the cat. Sure. Another creature

125
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:37,859
joins your caravan. Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you. You came

126
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:45,319
across an abandoned sack. You found a squirrel in a bottle. Break it in case of an emergency.

127
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:53,769
And I have a second. Another useful implement. I'll allow you to tip the scales with it. Items?

128
00:20:53,769 --> 00:21:01,019
Three is as much as you can carry. He's gonna take 10 hours on act one alone. Don't worry.

129
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:12,539
You were ambushed while crossing some rough terrain. All right, so let's go.

130
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:23,079
You sacrificed me while I was sleeping. It was the right play. I get it. Maybe you'll help me.

131
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:36,710
Play along for now. You may now see my moves ahead of time. Um, wolf cub. What does that mean? A card

132
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,869
bearing this sigil will grow into a more powerful form after one turn on the board. How are we gonna

133
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,950
get rid of that? What's this? Boulder? It's just in the way. Stump. All right, these things are

134
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:59,400
just blocking. So what do we got? I got cat. Uh, I have to put a squirrel up. Squirrel. Uh, squirrel's

135
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,500
gonna go here. And then that's all I can do, right? Let's go. And turn. Like, wait, do I,

136
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,450
is there any, is there mana? Mind the ambitious wolf cub that ages swiftly. Is there mana in this

137
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:27,130
game? Give me another squirrel. All right, we'll go and squirrel here. And then I'm doing how,

138
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,029
what is the river snapper? One and six. Okay. I should do the river snapper. Probably. If I

139
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,740
do river snapper, I can put the river snapper here and then it'll last a long time. Can I move

140
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:46,460
the boulder? Oh wait, I'll do cat here instead. Right? Yeah. I think so. I don't know. Because

141
00:22:46,460 --> 00:23:02,900
this comes back. If this does not perish. Okay. Now, now, now check this out. What? Uh, river

142
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,819
snapper here or stoat here? Which is better? Probably river snapper. Why not? Listen to your

143
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:58,039
mods. What's happening? My mic is rumbling. Wait, what? Hold on. Okay. I think I got it. We good?

144
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:08,390
I think we're good. How's this? Are we back? Are we good? Normal? Back? We good? We good? Yeah.

145
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,539
All right. I don't know why that happened. Sorry about that. All right. So now I'm going,

146
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,940
I'm just going to go river snapper because it's cool. There's a turtle and I'm going to put it

147
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,220
right here. Wait, should I sacrifice the cat? I have to do both anyways. I'm going to go over here

148
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,569
and go. And I'm going to sacrifice this fucking thing and I'm putting this over here.

149
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:42,900
Here we go. All right. He's got a bat. The airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly.

150
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:56,660
My bat flew right over your stove. That's stupid. All right. I want a random card. All right. What's

151
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:05,750
on the board right now? This will kill this. This is just kind of to be able to feed me,

152
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:13,460
but this will kill that. This will, this is going to get through this, but it's all right.

153
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:31,289
There are three kills on the board right now. I think I, can I even do anything? I could sacrifice

154
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:41,720
these two and put the wolf out. But why would that help? I think I'm just going to pass. Okay.

155
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,359
And now I'm going to pull out a squirrel. Check this shit out. Squirrel going right here. Wolf

156
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,569
is going to eat these two. Wolf going down right here. Bingo. Get rid of you. And that should give

157
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:03,210
me a one, two, three, four. And here we go. Another wolf. I think I just killed him right now.

158
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:18,059
You prevailed and trekked onwards past the now bloody terrain. See? Nobody thought I was going

159
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:33,109
to be on that for 10 hours. New card. The young wolf cub grows into a wolf after a single turn.

160
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:51,349
A meek sparrow, an inexpensive, if evil flying creature. What do you think chat? This seems

161
00:26:51,349 --> 00:27:00,180
better, but I kind of like the way that this can just fly over everything. I'll take the wolf.

162
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,980
That sounds, I mean, nevermind. I was going to say something stupid that would like literally

163
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:14,140
be clipped for the rest of my life. What's this? Stumbled into some strange stones in the mist.

164
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:23,450
You were compelled to choose a worthy sacrifice. One that will be lost forever. One of the squirrels.

165
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:35,079
Oh no. I don't want to get rid of the cat. The cat's like perfect. I don't, I want the cat. The

166
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:52,230
cat is just a free mana every time. I kind of like this. I just got this, but it sucks. Pick me.

167
00:27:52,230 --> 00:28:02,200
Wait, what? Wait, what's going on here? I'm confused. Wait, hold on. Back up. What happened?

168
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:16,019
I thought I was sacrificing. What's going on? I'm sacrificing this. What an honor. The ghastly

169
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:23,500
spectacle, but the soul of the wolf cub now lives in the stoat. Oh, it like consumes the card and

170
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:35,589
I get it. I get it. Okay. Go with the flow, man. Yeah, I got it. I figured out. I hold my totem,

171
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:44,410
but it describes my canine cards with the airborne sigil. He's completely insane. You see that,

172
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:52,900
right? No pathetic, really no care for his cards. Only keeps me around to watch me suffer.

173
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:04,779
He's going to lean forward and it's going to be the sus face. Okay. So let's get a squirrel.

174
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,890
What do you have? These things can fly. All right. Two and one.

175
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:27,799
Back on the board. Okay. I think that's all I can do, right? Oh, it has to. Oh, I get it. Okay.

176
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:33,829
I thought, okay, they have to be, it's the card directly in front. It doesn't go all the way back.

177
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:45,589
My totem has granted my card the power of flight. I just lost. I need, I need a squirrel right now

178
00:29:45,589 --> 00:30:15,700
and then what is the wolf? Yeah, wolf. Oh shit. Hold on. Right? Yeah. Am I doing this right?

179
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:26,859
This thing can fly. Uh, can I move these around or no? I think I'm going to take a random card.

180
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:43,400
Oh, this is a bad idea. You're three damage away from winning. Okay. Whatever. I'll take the hit.

181
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:54,730
Doesn't matter. Okay. Now I'm going to take a, I think I just won. I won. Use the pillar? Pillars?

182
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:05,690
What do you mean? No, I, yeah, I win. That's it. How do I, do I have to, do I have to play something?

183
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:17,700
Okay. I win. Yeah. What's it about the pillars? Oh, pliers. Okay. You're going to survive maybe.

184
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:37,829
Knock on wood. That's how I do it. Raven, skunk, or sparrow. What does the skunk do again?

185
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:45,019
I, okay. Stinky, this creature opposing a card bearing this sigil loses one power.

186
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,619
Card bearing this sigil will strike an opponent directly even if there is a creature opposing it.

187
00:31:50,619 --> 00:32:03,420
But this just, it just flies over and hits. This thing smells. I feel like this thing is amazing.

188
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,450
Stinky is good too. I don't want to end up, I feel like I have too many cards that are too

189
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:21,589
sacrifice. Isn't this, aren't I like late checking too much? I think I need some smaller things.

190
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:33,779
A one, two fly is busted. Go, just go full damage. Um, I think I'm going to do stinky.

191
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:40,970
I kind of, I don't know. I need some smaller cards. All right. This is a sacrifice pit or a fire.

192
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,579
What do I, what should I do? Um, I have not, I don't know what this is yet, so I'm going to go

193
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:56,490
this way. I haven't seen this yet. You came across a small group of survivors. Faces shrunken from

194
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:03,180
starvation. They huddled around a campfire. They looked upon your group of preachers and beckoned.

195
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm warm. One of your creatures by the fire. One said warm it by the fire. That will enhance

196
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,109
its power said another. They're going to cook it and eat it. You notice one of the survivors wiping

197
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:19,400
drool from them. Yeah, this is horseshit. I'm not putting anybody here. How do I leave? How do I do

198
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,630
a spinning roundhouse kick to this guy's head and kick it like 500 yards that way. They're going to

199
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:39,460
eat it. I don't want them to do that. Hmm. They're going to eat this. Maybe the river snapper. I feel

200
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:46,920
like this is one six. That's a lot of health though. One of the wolves. I feel like this is,

201
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:58,890
this is all right, but do the stoat. I don't want to kill the stoat. Maybe the skunk. Is this,

202
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:04,299
okay. I feel like this is going to kill whatever this is in here. Is this going to kill this or

203
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:13,800
does it make it stronger? The fire warmed the poor skunk enhancing its power. One of the survivors

204
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,070
reached toward it. Another gnashed their teeth. Without a word, you roundhouse kick the leader

205
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:27,690
in the head. Okay, I get it. That's actually pretty good though because now that will do damage and

206
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:38,070
it takes power away. Okay, this is pretty cool. There's a way out for both of us. It's somewhere

207
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:49,960
in this foul cabin. Be silent or I will tear you to shreds. Mighty leap. A card bearing this

208
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,530
integer will block an opposing creature bearing the airborne. Okay, so they can't fly over this.

209
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:09,940
And here they are. Grizzly bear. That's not good. Four six. Oh shit. Um, four six. How am I supposed

210
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:42,570
to hit to handle this? I think I have to avoid it. Just go, just go for kill. Ow. Uh, what does

211
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:52,900
this do? Oh fuck. Oops. Okay. Um, what the fuck? How am I supposed to handle this? What do the

212
00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:07,659
pliers do again? Not now. Draw a card first though. Um, this thing, it's going to kill everything.

213
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:14,869
Okay, now what does this do? You will place a weight on the scales. The path. Oh, I just put a

214
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:25,340
weight on it. All right, so the squirrel is going to die. That's fine. I think, right? So this squirrel

215
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:55,219
gets hit. I think I'm dead here. Uh, use the pliers now. A well-earned point of damage. I didn't think

216
00:36:55,219 --> 00:37:06,579
you would really do it. What the fuck? Okay, can I kill him now? No, I just lose. I don't, I think

217
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:19,639
I just die here. Maybe not. I think I just have to put a squirrel down and just let it die. I can't

218
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:35,239
take this many hits. What am I supposed to do? Like, what am I supposed to do about this? Just

219
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:45,510
don't get hit. I mean, I'm just going to, this spot, you sure? I don't know. I can't, I can't even do

220
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:55,829
anything. What the fuck am I supposed to do about this? That was like five grizzlies. You lost.

221
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:02,860
Using this as a learning opportunity may be the only way to mitigate my disappointment. Get up.

222
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:16,869
Get up from the table. Catch me the candlestick from atop the barrel beside the door. What the

223
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:48,260
fuck? Bring it here. Ugh. Can I just leave? Honestly, is this the scenario right here? Uh,

224
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:56,420
yeah. I'm going. I'm sprinting forward and just wild swinging and like screaming and my hands coming

225
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,980
out like this and I don't even know what's, I'm just going to be, I'm just going to be stabbing

226
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:05,219
and swinging, biting and screaming and just stabbing. Right? Like I, that's how I'm getting out.

227
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:28,599
Sit back down. Let me explain something to you. That was one of the two mistakes you can make

228
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:46,230
here. If you make another, I must sacrifice you. Now, where were we? What? Read the clock.

229
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:54,809
Okay. I should probably go right because this will give me, you have two lives. I get it. Okay.

230
00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:18,489
I'm going to go this way. Oh, huh. Ooh. What's this? What do these mean? I mean, I'm taking

231
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:24,019
the grizzly. Why the hell would I not? But what do these two mean? That's your little, uh, dollops

232
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:30,659
means you already have them. I'm taking, of course I'm taking the grizzly. What are you out of your

233
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:35,860
mind? And I'm going to, I'm going to put the grizzly up here so the grizzly does even more

234
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:45,420
damage. Really is going to be unfucking beatable. There is room for a creature around the fire.

235
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,980
There is the warmth will enhance its health. One of the survivors said nothing at all, but could

236
00:40:51,980 --> 00:41:04,650
not stop licking their lips. It's health. Maybe it's the turtle. No way. I just have a four,

237
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:24,820
eight grizzly. That would be kind of insane, right? Or a one, five skunk. Wolf would be good.

238
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:33,530
Maybe the cat too. Three, two. Oh yeah. Like a three, three, four sounds really good. Really

239
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:41,110
strong. You're never going to be able to play the bear or what does this turn into? Oops.

240
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:57,800
I take it out more powerful. Does it just gain one, one? That'd be a two, five. So then,

241
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,280
so this would be all right. Yeah, that's it gets two, five. All right. That's, that's probably this

242
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:10,260
then. I think I'm going for that. Although I, that I'm that's only, then you only need to sacrifice

243
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:21,860
one thing for this. He said, pick something else. Do I have to listen to him? This is probably,

244
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,860
this is the safest one. I think that just make, gives it like a nice strong card. I think I'm

245
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:40,440
going for it. That's just like a solid three, four. I think that makes sense. All right. This

246
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,559
looks like a boss, like a real boss. Is this going to be like a tutorial boss where it kills

247
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,260
me and sends me to the back to the beginning or something? Don't read chat. All right. All right.

248
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:56,659
I won't read chat anymore. The trees seem to close in around you as a chill mist descended.

249
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:05,940
In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal on stone. All right. Lay out your arms then.

250
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:26,170
I'm back already. Took you for dead. It was the prospector. At the end of the owner's turn,

251
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,730
a card bearing the sigil will have moved in the direction inscribed in the sigil. So it goes like

252
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:52,579
this way, like that. Okay. So I want to put squirrel and then cat girl and get that cat down

253
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:09,739
and then put the skunk down. Oops. All right. Is it all right? I think I did this wrong.

254
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:18,789
Uh, I did this wrong. This is bad. Okay. I'm going to act on this might be stupid, but I'm going to

255
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:29,750
do this. And then we don't do this yet. Did I do it? So it's only a three, two. What? All right.

256
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:47,849
I'm done. Okay. Who cares? It comes right back. Where is it? Doesn't it come back? It doesn't come

257
00:44:47,849 --> 00:45:04,380
back. Why? Um, this up so bad. Didn't I? All right. I can save it. I think what's over here.

258
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:09,980
I can save it. I can save it. I can save it. I fucked up. I fucked up. It's okay. I fucked up.

259
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:36,280
I fucked up. I fucked up. There we go. All right. Okay. I fucked up. Now I do squirrel and

260
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,260
sacrifice him. This will go forward. Okay. I can take a few hits. I think I'm okay.

261
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:54,630
This is salvageable. I fucked up. Did I put squirrel over here on the left? Probably.

262
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:03,590
I can take a couple of hits. I'm going to put the squirrel on the left.

263
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:11,030
I'm looking at chat. I do. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a streamer. My eyes are glued over here. I like,

264
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:17,190
I, I'm a live streamer. I go, I go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

265
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,369
Like, that's what we do. All right. I'm not looking over here anymore.

266
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:38,900
I'm almost at the fucking end of the game. I win. I win right now. I won. I won. Game over. I win.

267
00:46:40,250 --> 00:47:00,489
Bring it. I hope you didn't think it'd be that easy. Gold. I've struck gold. Oh, this is bad.

268
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:17,219
What does this do? Old nugget. Why doesn't have a description? Um, I want to read what this does.

269
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:26,920
You're dead. Well, I can't do what I can't. I can't. I just have to kill that. I,

270
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:39,260
I have to block damage somehow. What the fuck? What's horseshit? What? What happened? How did

271
00:47:39,260 --> 00:48:00,019
I lose so badly? He's doing the prospector again. Easy boss. The mule's key. What's that? Um,

272
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:36,170
I just lost. What happens now? More gold for me. You aren't dead yet. This isn't purgatory.

273
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,219
Though you may think of it that way. Before you expire, I must ask you a favor.

274
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:53,500
I would like a memento. Your very own death card. It's quite plain at the moment, isn't it?

275
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,619
We will work together to amend that. I want this to be the perfect memento of you.

276
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:09,110
Here are some cards from your mediocre deck. We can put them to good use. Please choose a card

277
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:18,250
to draw the cost from. They both cost two. Doesn't matter. Cost of two blood from the

278
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:26,460
river is separate. They're both, they're both two. Add another. This time I will use its power and

279
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:39,829
health. The numbers. Or six, right? I mean, like that's a bear. Is this a bad thing? Or six. Or

280
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:46,099
power and six health from the grizzly. Now choose a card from which we will extract the sigils.

281
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:54,840
Oh, and it can live forever. Is this what I get? Or does it stink? This can live forever?

282
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:04,710
Or the, or the stink. I think the stink might be great. You can sacrifice it forever.

283
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:11,860
It's definitely the cat, without a doubt. So now what? I never did ask you your name.

284
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:50,570
Oh, this is my card? There is now but one final matter. The portrait. Here we go again. Another

285
00:50:50,570 --> 00:51:00,389
challenger. Perhaps it is time. Perhaps you can understand bones. The resourceful opossum costs

286
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:07,940
two bones. You gain a bone when one of your creatures perishes for any reason. Yo, I think

287
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:25,079
I just fucking won the game. This is cool. This is cool. This is cool. All right, so there's a

288
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:33,340
rattler there. It's one health. So we're gonna go like this and go. We're gonna go and go here.

289
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:39,030
Drop that down. From the death of your creature you've gained a bone. You will not lose this

290
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:57,780
until it is spent or the battle ends. Okay, let's go. Oops. Oh, I fucked up. Sorry. Oh shit. All

291
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:04,780
right. I forgot that they had to move down. Okay. Oops. All right. So wait, I can do the possum now,

292
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:16,119
right? Oh, I can do the possum. One, one. Go ahead and get a squirrel down just for shits.

293
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:37,880
There we go. Okay. Pull it back. Oh, he's gonna die anyways. Oops. It's all right. Remember, take

294
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:51,590
your pants off. Oh, forgot your figurine. Get up and fetch it for me. It's beside the safe.

295
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:39,300
All right. Hold on a minute here. Bullfrog. What does this mean? Can I like open the safe?

296
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:47,099
Times it? Six, three, 12? What time is it? Oh, you just got your safe opened, dumbass. 12,

297
00:53:47,099 --> 00:54:12,340
three, six. I was on a 12. Never mind. Let us continue. Oh, coyote. This is a game. This

298
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:23,579
game is fun. This is a good game. This game is fun. Rattler, the unkillable cockroach returns to your

299
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:41,179
hand after dying. Oh, the unkillable. I'm taking the cockroach. You know, you're free to get up

300
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:48,940
again. Keep your blood flowing. I have no tyrant. You may stand whenever the map is unrolled. It

301
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:56,019
allows me time to plan your next encounter. Do keep your hands off my possessions. All right.

302
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,500
All right. What do you got here? What's going on here? How do I open? Okay. I got to open the

303
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:17,260
safe. I need a key. All right. What else do I got? I got to open the safe. This means something.

304
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:23,449
This means something. This is something to do with the time or the time of day it is. What time is

305
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:29,880
the clock? It is 12, three, six. Okay. I can move these. Let's go ahead and think about this for a

306
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:41,019
second here. I need three numbers, obviously. That hand doesn't never changes by the way.

307
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:48,760
This never changes off of midnight. Okay. So this never changes. So what we're going to do is we're

308
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:56,539
going to put the whole thing. We're going to put the whole thing at midnight and then it'll go.

309
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:11,349
Oh, nevermind. All right. So I need, I need three numbers, obviously. I don't know where I'm going

310
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:18,260
to get them. I'd probably get them over the course of the game. All right. Well, let's sit down.

311
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,940
Whatever. I'll figure it out. What's this? Mighty leap. Oh, there's 207. Okay. Thank you. 273. You

312
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:58,519
got it. That's a 273 right there. Excuse me. Open. Clock. 273. Open. Wait, there's another

313
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:13,380
thing. There's this. 273. I got it. Stink bug. Oh, hello. I wasn't sure if I would ever escape

314
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:22,619
that iron crypt. Is, is the stoat around? The stunted wolf? This madness must end. Put that away.

315
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:30,679
We're always got the key. This is where I turn around and I go, look at what I got.

316
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:50,309
Hmm. Maybe I should put it in here. Wow. Okay. What the fuck is this? Two, zero, five, um, one,

317
00:57:50,309 --> 00:58:13,699
three, two, one. Okay. Zero to five, zero to five. Okay. This is like, this kills this. So I need to,

318
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:21,059
can I move these around? I don't think you guys understand. I, I, I play these kinds of games on

319
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:26,860
iPad almost every single day. I mean, I, I, I play games like this. I've, I've beaten every single

320
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:35,030
the franchise, the room. I played every single one of those three times. I was made to play this.

321
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:46,179
Okay. So this is going to do two to one. I wonder if I can flip these. Two, one, one, three. It is

322
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:50,739
one of the five, one of the five. Is it right? Good. Five is correct. So now I got to go like this.

323
00:58:51,980 --> 00:59:01,530
So this is how much I'm trying to do damage, trying to kill somebody here. Right? Two out of five.

324
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:09,000
What am I looking for here? This is, what am I looking for? One here. Okay. So it's got to be

325
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:17,000
like this up a little bit more like that and up here. I'm not even sure what's going on here.

326
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:30,539
Okay. Three out of five. So what's happening here? Let's take a minute here. What's happening here?

327
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:36,579
Sigma relax. So this is doing one damage to, to this character. This is doing two damage to

328
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:43,289
this character. This is doing three damage to this character. It needs to be completely perfectly

329
00:59:43,289 --> 01:00:06,360
balanced. That's technically right. I'm not looking. Three out of five. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

330
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:14,059
Oh, that was, that was easier than I thought it was going to be. I got a stink. I forgot that I had

331
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:17,900
put that there very well. You may add it to your deck and I'll deal you one every so often. What

332
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:23,369
does this do? All right. Close this thing. Give me the next one. All right. So I get it. I understand.

333
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:34,679
I get it. This is a, this is locked out here. This can't be moved, but this can cause this is flight.

334
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:42,500
Got two out of five there. Let's go ahead and make this happen. Let me say three to five,

335
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,010
get that one back. We can please. Thank you. This one cannot be moved with five. You got it.

336
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:54,630
Put this back up here if we could please. Put this up. Here's your two out of five. Get that

337
01:00:54,630 --> 01:01:01,269
up here please. Here's your two out of five. Get that up here if we could please. One out of five.

338
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:06,679
Let's put that back down please. I can't move them back and forth. Here's your two out of five. Put

339
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:52,099
that over here please. Close. Hold on. Three to five. Okay. I can't move this one. I gotta think.

340
01:01:52,099 --> 01:02:09,099
I'm not looking. No, these are both fly. This is, this is the only thing doing the damage right

341
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:19,670
here. Isn't it? Wouldn't this do it? Here we go. I got it. I play these games in bed all day. Don't

342
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:24,150
worry. I get it. Wonderful creatures. Those ants very well. I will add them to your deck and make

343
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:32,780
them available for future challenges. Nice. Oh yeah. Let's go. I'll take all the cards please.

344
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:38,179
Let's make the game easy. I don't know what the bug does. I need to play a little bit more to

345
01:02:38,179 --> 01:02:50,099
figure out what the bug does. What about this? Can't move this. Always check every single crevice.

346
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:59,340
Can't do that yet. Whatever it is. All right. What do we got here? I don't think I can do this yet.

347
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:11,820
I'm gonna play a little bit. Let's do a round. Now that I get some new cards, let's go. There's

348
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:18,090
some bone tokens for a rainy night. Four. If you deem it necessary, you may cut up one of my cards

349
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:24,090
with these. A rock might get you out of a hard place. That's kind of just a block. I have to

350
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:38,119
choose one. I don't know. I'm gonna say boulder. Just block damage. Or the scissors would be good

351
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:50,579
too. Bones are good too. Feeling overburdened enough with the full three items you carried on.

352
01:03:50,659 --> 01:04:04,150
You again. Indeed. Our friend freed me. Well, I basically told him how to do it.

353
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:11,880
You got a plan? We have another friend here. You've gotta be. I wouldn't call him a friend.

354
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:24,980
But I suppose we are in deep this time. Pretty good boys. This guy has three shirts. What's going

355
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:40,010
on with my hair? Look at my hair. Bullfrog. What do we got? You are lacking squirrels.

356
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:45,369
Mighty leap. Card bearing the sigil will block. An opposing creature bearing the airborne sigil.

357
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:56,949
Alright, so I can put this in front of a bird. Let's put a squirrel down. Right here sounds good

358
01:04:56,949 --> 01:05:08,730
I think. Yeah, just put it down now. Wait, oh, it takes bone, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright,

359
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:22,460
let's go. Alright, so now I want... What is the stink bug is... Alright, yeah. So we're gonna put

360
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:39,260
stink bug down. Let's kill a squirrel. Get this out. Oh, shit! I fucked it up. It's alright.

361
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:53,030
God damn it. I gotta remember more about that. It's okay. Okay. Back in the game. Alright,

362
01:05:53,030 --> 01:06:04,840
let's go. I screwed... I wanted to put a... Yeah, I screwed up. It's fine. Give me a squirrel and

363
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:12,219
you'll kill that. Sounds good. We're good. Yeah, that's fine. Wolf, I don't need to do anything.

364
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:19,400
This game's over anyways. A brutal of you. You dealt me more damage than you needed to win.

365
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:25,300
However, in my game, such feats are rewarded. Be precise. A tooth to keep for each extra damage

366
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:40,340
dealt. The trapper may be interested in your spoils, but I get extra teeth? Pretty cool.

367
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:50,570
Elk fawn. An ascent fawn. It quickly grows into an elk and moves to the right. And what do you do?

368
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:57,619
That scared the shit out of me. I forgot about that. And I was like, the game is reading my

369
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:06,969
hard drive or something. I actually freaked out. Um, okay. Well, I mean, obviously I'm taking this.

370
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:14,280
What is that? Six bones. I mean, why wouldn't I not take this? It's literally like the best thing

371
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:25,019
that I have. And I'm going to make it more powerful in the... Why would you... Okay, I have a question.

372
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:32,300
Don't spoil the game for me. I have a question. This is just for free. This you have to sacrifice

373
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:41,179
someone. What's the kind of difference here? Do you get more? They do two different things.

374
01:07:41,179 --> 01:07:51,670
You can get multiple abilities. It gives you... It gives card effects. Uh, you like essentially

375
01:07:51,670 --> 01:08:05,110
absorb the card. I wonder if I should do this one. I'm doing this. The choice is yours.

376
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:10,460
Ant Queen. What is that? When a card bearing the sigil is played, an ant is created in your hand.

377
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:20,250
That seems kind of good. Cockroach. When a card bearing a copy of his... I mean, why would... I'm

378
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:26,600
going to do that with a thermo. That seems broken. That's absolutely broken. I'm guaranteed to beat

379
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,960
the game right now. I'm going to beat the game right now. I'm going to walk through the rest

380
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:45,659
of the game. Marvelous. I'll go. No, a thermo is gone. I mean, that's simple. That's very simple.

381
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:54,220
I now am going to get two of these and I'm going to walk through the game. This is really cool.

382
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:59,340
I like this. This is a fun game. Now I know why everyone said to play it. So strange. Why can't

383
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:09,659
I remember his name? I believe I lost some of my memory in the flash. Oh, these are people that

384
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:14,470
played the game before he made cards for them. He took their pictures and now they like cards

385
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:30,970
forever. That's what's going to happen to me. What do you got on the board? Okay. So this thing

386
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:38,220
hurts. I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like slow game playing Andy, by the way, because like,

387
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:54,229
I need to like pay attention. The value represented with this sigil will be equal to the number of

388
01:09:54,229 --> 01:10:06,170
ants that the owner has on their side of the table. All right. What do you got? That's not going to

389
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:41,739
help. Okay. I need to get this into memory. It's hard to call it cowardly. I don't, I don't understand

390
01:10:41,739 --> 01:11:08,060
the ant thing. I can't play this. Why not? I have to draw for us. Okay. Uh, uh, I would play.

391
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:19,109
Thanks. What damage is this thing doing? This thing doesn't have damage. Wait, what does the

392
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:30,149
worker ant not do any damage? It's just one. Oh, oh, okay. Oh, so it's how many ants you currently

393
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:58,149
just have. I'm going to get rid of this guy. Get your hand, elbows back. I don't know if you're

394
01:11:58,149 --> 01:12:02,149
putting shit on the board or not. We get a referee to blow fucking whistle. That's don't do that.

395
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:08,739
I think I'm doing this. I, this is probably stupid. This is probably dumb, but I mean,

396
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:24,140
this is dumb. What I'm doing is dumb. What I just did was dumb, but whatever. I just won the game.

397
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:44,520
Maybe it wasn't dumb at mantis. Ooh, it hits both left and right. The alpha urgent boldness,

398
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:50,359
the creatures that stand beside it. So it gives what plus flow plus one plus one. All right. So

399
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:55,640
it gives plus one damage to everybody next to it. I feel like I want the mantis. I want the mantis

400
01:12:57,859 --> 01:13:05,399
and then I'm going to make the mantis stronger by sacrificing something that I would do.

401
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:28,890
Then maybe that's what I would do. That's what I'm doing right now. I think it's going to be you

402
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,609
sacrifice. Wait, I could do, whoa, wait, I could do the reverse. Hold on. I could do the,

403
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:39,260
how do I back up? I could do the reverse. So if I sacrifice the mantis, I can give it to somebody

404
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:58,979
else. Oh shit. Uh, the wolf probably, the wolf would be crazy or the ant queen. Yeah, it's

405
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:24,199
definitely the wolf. This is, that's huge. What is that? What's that thing? Greetings. All right.

406
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:53,590
This is pretty basic here. I'm going to go, uh, squirrel bullfrog here and then, uh, yeah,

407
01:14:53,590 --> 01:15:01,689
this won't kill it. I can sacrifice him afterwards. He'll actually, he'll fly over. I wonder if it's

408
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:07,579
worth it. Sacrificing. All right. We got stink bug, which what do you got? That'd be a one, one.

409
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:38,819
He's going to die anyways, so I need to get rid of him. What do you got to stink bug? Hold on.

410
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:53,300
My brain having trouble here. It's like, I could, I just got to pick a play. Okay. I'll kill. Um,

411
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:04,460
you go here. You'll kill this and then you're going to go here. This will die, but it's okay.

412
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:15,029
Cause I got this guy coming to here and let's go. It's fine. Okay. Whoa. I'm actually about to lose.

413
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:29,930
Look, there's a third talking card somewhere around here. Personally, I hate the guy biggest

414
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:37,460
kill joy ever, but he's the only one of us with a plan to get things back to normal.

415
01:16:37,460 --> 01:17:26,069
Okay. That was a misplay. What are you in my chat right now? Relax. Okay. All right. All right.

416
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:53,300
All right. Ooh, good draw. Awesome. Good draw. I see the way this is going. I concede. You may

417
01:17:53,300 --> 01:18:07,850
accept my surrender or you may finish this match the slow way. Why would I do that? Because if I

418
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:24,220
don't get extra tokens, if I do a bunch of damage, um, is this a dumb thing that I'm doing? All right.

419
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:36,939
Well, hold on. If I sacrifice stote and the opossum, I'll have two and two, right? That's

420
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:40,220
okay. That should, then that should do it. And that'll overkill. I think. Yeah.

421
01:18:44,699 --> 01:19:06,140
Our numbers, the ants creed and put this out. I get extra. Um, all right. This is going to be

422
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:45,609
a huge overkill. Ooh, I love that pot. What's your opinion on the tectonic plates? What do you,

423
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:54,550
what do you want me to say? A thing that's, uh, it's a thing that's under the ground and

424
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:59,909
it makes the world shake. You were stopped along the way by a trapper looking to liquidate his

425
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:07,880
pelts. There was something uncanny about his appearance, but you were quickly distracted by

426
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:30,020
his wares. Here to look at my pelts, take a pelt free of charge. Um, rabbit. What do these do?

427
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:45,619
See the quality. Oh, it's the extra tokens. What do they do? I can have one for free. I don't get

428
01:20:45,619 --> 01:21:00,220
it. Do I have to do this? Take the gold ones. Well, I mean, that's, I was going to take the

429
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:15,319
gold one, but I don't know. I'm going to take the gold one. That's what I would do. Golden pelt.

430
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:30,840
And I'll take a rabbit. You're leaving already? Please consider me pelts. Didn't I already take

431
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:44,380
them? You'll need, how do I leave? I'm done. I, thanks for your business. The man assured you

432
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:52,060
of the value of the pelts. They appear to be useless in a fight. Stop doubting yourself.

433
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,550
That's all I do. He mentioned that the trader further down the path would reward you for them.

434
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:28,279
I don't know what to do. I could sacri, I don't, I don't want to run like I'm getting rid of all

435
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:37,079
my cards though. No, I, I, I sacrifice like three cards already. I think warm light of a campfire.

436
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:45,180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Through the 10 hungry guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Enhance its power. All right.

437
01:22:45,180 --> 01:23:03,939
Stop this. It's going to be Wolf, man. You kidding me? It would be me too. I think I'm doing Wolf.

438
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:11,399
I haven't, I haven't seen this card come up once. Balance your damage across the cards.

439
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:20,489
Yeah. I kind of am just being like a two card Andy. Yeah. Aren't I? I like this one,

440
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:28,630
but I also like the opossum. I think I'm going to opossum. Opossum. That's what I'm doing.

441
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:39,979
That's what I'm doing. They had enhanced the creature's power, butting a few of the

442
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:46,520
survivors to ruling. You made a, Hey, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck? What? No,

443
01:23:46,520 --> 01:24:00,229
I wanted, I, that's two bones and it gives me two damage. What? My boss battles are high stakes.

444
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:05,750
Test of your aptitude. With one flame, you'll either overcome them or die or not. I will let

445
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:19,720
you keep the smoke. Oh, it's this dude again. The incessant clank, clank, clanking. It's the

446
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:39,220
prospector, the prospector. Yeehaw. All right, let's go again. What does this do? What does that do?

447
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:47,850
Again, the smoke. When a card bearing the sigil dies, four bones are awarded instead of one. Oh

448
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:56,229
shit. Can I just get that out there now? Let's get that out there right now. Kill the mule first,

449
01:24:56,229 --> 01:25:08,359
right? That's a card set. All right. This is what I'm going for. I'm going for, get rid of this,

450
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:21,399
put this here. I don't know what the pelt does. Squirrel. But don't be stupid about this. I fucked

451
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:32,680
it up already. This thing goes right. Shit. Can I sacrifice that? I can. All right. So just sacrifice

452
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:39,909
it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. So I can just sacrifice this and put down

453
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:50,760
the, what does the most damage? One, three. I'll put you down. Good. You go here and then

454
01:25:52,659 --> 01:26:03,369
you go here and then you go here. And then what is the, I don't know what this does. I'm afraid to

455
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:20,010
use it. That's fine. Rabbit pelt. What the fuck? All right. I have to, I don't want to use these.

456
01:26:20,569 --> 01:26:30,840
What do these do? Why is it going this way? This will get killed. That's fine. I'll be all right.

457
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:39,619
They're blockers. All right. I'm just gonna put this one down. I'm putting this here.

458
01:26:40,579 --> 01:27:01,340
I'm about to, I'm about to win. Perfect. This is two, one. Perfect. All right. Move over. That's

459
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:13,989
fine. Good. All right. This is super wolf. Super wolf is going to take out these two. Oh, fuck off.

460
01:27:14,949 --> 01:28:07,060
Wait, what? Oh, it's all right. Wait. Okay. I, it goes like that. Oops. Okay. Okay. Do you have to

461
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:15,850
kill this stuff? Get them. Yeah. Please get rid of it. I don't, I can't do anything yet. Just go,

462
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:22,630
go again. Doesn't, I can't do anything yet. I'm putting Jerm around next turn. Here we go. Bingo.

463
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:33,500
Squirrel. Squirrel. Boing. Boing. Okay. Where's this going? This is, this is like just unbelievably

464
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:53,640
good. Go right here. Yeah. That's game over right now. Goodbye. What's that? Dag nabbit my mule.

465
01:28:56,710 --> 01:29:12,729
Thank you. Okay. What do I got? Um, I think I can win pretty easily here. Hold on. Elk is,

466
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:20,390
alpha is okay. Wait, I can do alpha. I got to put it right here. I could do

467
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:35,539
and don't have any hands. Ant queen is okay. Here's the deal. Uh, Elk is kind of sick too,

468
01:29:35,539 --> 01:29:41,449
though, isn't it? I think I'm going to do Elk. Oh no, wait, no, no. This gives ants.

469
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:56,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this do? Okay. We're good. All right. That's good.

470
01:29:56,300 --> 01:30:17,399
I'll have to win again. All right. I just win the game. Bingo. There it is. All right. First boss

471
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:29,029
done. Allow me to light your candles once more. I won't be killing you quite yet. Very nice.

472
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:39,670
You're the first in a while to overcome a boss. As a reward, you are granted an opportunity to

473
01:30:39,670 --> 01:31:00,840
select a rare card. Boost carefully. Strange larva. The level of brutish strength needs no

474
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:18,810
explanation. Seven? Seven and what? And Gek. The uninspiring Gek, perhaps you can find a use for it.

475
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:32,409
Um, this doesn't cost anything. I feel like these, these are, these are bait because this is free.

476
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:43,420
It does one damage and I can sacrifice it whenever I want. Um, what does this turn into? Probably

477
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:57,510
some kind of big bug or something, right? Taking the Gek. It's just a free card. Huge early game.

478
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:01,829
With sound of the prospector's pickaxe still ringing in your ears, you carried onwards.

479
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:16,630
The rank smell of rot and mold permeated the humid air. Every step forward was answered by

480
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:27,609
some nearby slip or slither, but cautiously into the wetlands. Good card. Barbara's nice, but Gek

481
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:39,000
is cool, dude. Yeah. River snapper, adder, barren. It spawns a rabbit when it is played.

482
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:55,640
Zero one rabbit. This is kind of an annoying card. Well, this is a zero two and it gives you a zero

483
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:05,300
one. Hmm. That's kind of, that's kind of annoying. I think it's, that's, that's, that's the adder.

484
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:08,739
I would take the adder just to in case you get run into a huge enemy or something. I don't know

485
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:17,239
what that is. What is this? I think this means I'm like deleting a card for some reason, right?

486
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:25,880
What does the pack do again? What's the backpack do? I clicked on this once. I forget what it was.

487
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:34,039
Items. I guess I want to see what this is, so I'm going to click it, right? I don't know what

488
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:46,899
this is. Some familiar stones, but there was something different. You intuited. The fate of

489
01:33:46,899 --> 01:33:58,539
the creature selected for this would not be pleasant. I delete a card. Do what you must.

490
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:15,720
Nope. That was the worst card that I have. The rabbit. I have just like a shitty rabbit

491
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:28,119
belt. No elp. I would probably get, I don't know. Bullfrog kind of sucks, but it only

492
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:36,039
sacrifice though. I feel like I'm going to need these later. I'm doing bullfrog. I'm going to,

493
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:45,420
I don't know what this does. Slaughtered the bullfrog. However, the bone lord was pleased

494
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:54,500
by your sacrifice. A minor boon of the bone lord. You will start each battle with one extra bone.

495
01:34:54,500 --> 01:35:17,350
That's kind of a big deal. Kind of at least, right? Worth it. Yeah. What does this mean?

496
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:59,130
All right. Let me go down here again. How many ants do I have? I got to move one person here.

497
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:37,539
Come on. I'm so close. There it is. Caged wolf. There's one, there's another one of these over

498
01:36:37,539 --> 01:37:14,420
here. I don't want to hit that. I can't. Okay. So I have to hit this one. It's three. Got it.

499
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:19,909
What is that? Without having met her, this wood carving is meaningless. In time you will

500
01:37:19,909 --> 01:37:29,369
understand its power. And there's a squirrel right here. Oh, it's just like hearthstone.

501
01:37:29,369 --> 01:37:59,100
What does that mean? That doesn't work. Still didn't do the clock yet. Is there another thing?

502
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:27,659
Oh no, I didn't. No, I didn't. Is there something listed here? Ah, hammer. Staff. Oh, teeth. Okay.

503
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:48,649
I got some teeth. Is there anything else I can do? I got another card. Oh, I don't think I can do

504
01:38:48,649 --> 01:39:11,779
anything about that. I got another card. What about the candles? Oh, you get a stump and you get a

505
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:30,149
frog. Okay. I'm doing ant queen. Uh, yeah. I'm going to wait until ant queen. All right. I don't

506
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:44,869
want this to get killed. So ant queen's going over here. Oh, perfect. All right. I'm going to

507
01:39:44,869 --> 01:40:03,350
put this down here in just a moment. All right. I want a squirrel. All right. So let me see here.

508
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:28,090
Out here. Work our ant here. Perfect. Very perfect. Very perfect. Very good. Excess damage is not

509
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:32,569
wasted. It carries over to the card behind the mangled corpse of the victim. So that was cool.

510
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:41,819
I didn't even know that. Lucky for you. All right. What do we got on the board? Adder. Bullfrog. I

511
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:55,829
don't care about the bullfrog. Although I could put the Adder out here. Oh, I need two. Shit.

512
01:40:55,829 --> 01:41:19,109
Probably should have read that. Oh, whatever. Uh, go here. Oh, I thought I won. I think I

513
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:52,250
win anyways. I think I win anyways. I keep fucking doing this. I keep fucking doing that.

514
01:41:52,250 --> 01:42:28,199
I keep forgetting this is two. I should still be fine though. Okay. Now go like this. I'm so

515
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:42,979
close to winning. Just win already. I'm not going to lose. I'm not going to lose. I have to pee.

516
01:42:42,979 --> 01:42:51,100
All right. I'm going to pee soon here. River otter. The elusive otter. It submerges itself

517
01:42:51,100 --> 01:43:06,760
during my turn. A beehive will draw a bee when it gets attacked. Or Kaminsky. When an opposing

518
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,000
creature is placed opposite to an empty space, a card bearing the sigil will move to that empty

519
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:23,850
space. Let me read that again. When somebody on the other team is placed in an empty space,

520
01:43:26,569 --> 01:43:38,420
opposite an empty space, this card will move to that space. And it's like a thorns. Okay. I get it.

521
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:48,699
That's a good card. Submerged itself during its opponent's turn. While submerged, opposing creatures

522
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:57,180
attack its owner. All right. So this is just like stealth. That's not bad either. This is cool too

523
01:43:57,180 --> 01:44:03,560
though. I could buff this at a campfire. I think I'm going to do the beehive. Otter is unkillable.

524
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:13,560
Um, they all suck. I would probably, I'm going to, I'm going to do beehive. You need to go piss. I

525
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:22,090
will in a second. I'm busy. All right. Now I'm going to, I'm going to buff the beehive. This might be

526
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:29,859
health. It's health and that's big. Or I could sacrifice somebody. Maybe I'll sacrifice somebody.

527
01:44:29,859 --> 01:44:45,609
I'm going to sacrifice someone. All right. What do I want? What do I want to sacrifice?

528
01:44:45,609 --> 01:44:57,750
Oh man. Beehive. Beehive on somebody. Go piss. Why are you saying go piss girl? What? All right.

529
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:08,460
I think I'm doing beehive. Yep. I'm going to give that to the ant queen. No. Somebody that I can,

530
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:16,329
it has to be somebody that can stay alive. What is it? Ooh, cage wolf. That's just six health.

531
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:27,180
What is it? Okay. This is kind of interesting. It'll just spawn a bunch of shit. It's got to

532
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:42,729
have to be something with at least a few health. Maybe the cat. Skink too, right? I'm going to say

533
01:45:42,729 --> 01:45:49,739
probably this because that will just spawn bees over and over again. If it's a bad idea,

534
01:45:49,739 --> 01:46:19,109
it's a bad idea. Whatever. It has a ton of health. Bullfrog, rabbit, pelt, squirrel. Okay. I'll put

535
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:36,600
the, just go here and I'm going to put the pelt down right here because why not? Oh, I, oops.

536
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:49,270
Ant queen. Can I even sacrifice two things? Shit, that was stupid. Yeah. That was just,

537
01:46:49,829 --> 01:46:53,590
that was just bogus of me. I don't know why I did that, but it's all right. I can just go another

538
01:46:53,590 --> 01:47:08,810
turn. I actually want you to clear this shit out. I don't want it. Oh, that was a, that was a big

539
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:33,500
problem. That was actually really bad. Uh, I think I have to do this. Oh my God. I'm fucking dead.

540
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:47,989
I'm going to die right now. I blew it so bad. This will be two. All right, hold on. I'll kill

541
01:47:47,989 --> 01:47:55,140
this. Okay. If I get an ant out here, it'll be two, two, which it'll kill this. It'll kill the

542
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:15,289
thing behind it. I think I really blew it. I can put the pelt down here or something. Or should I

543
01:48:15,289 --> 01:48:35,579
kill this row? What row is more dangerous? What row is more dangerous? Probably this one. Actually,

544
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:57,689
I don't know. They're both kind of the same. The spider is like, was that loud? And then I'll put

545
01:48:57,689 --> 01:49:18,180
the pelt over here. Right? I hope that's right. You scared me. Like there's a bug in the room.

546
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:22,970
Well, I don't know. If you were watching, I clearly gave at least two or three seconds of like a, oh,

547
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:28,869
I'm about to yell because it's a spider. All right. I got to put something down here so that I don't

548
01:49:28,869 --> 01:49:36,569
die. This is going to get killed, right? Or do I not care? Cause I'll get some way out. I'll be

549
01:49:36,729 --> 01:50:09,050
I'll be fine. Okay. Now piece of shit. I don't think I need this yet because hold on. This'll

550
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:19,100
do two or will I beat it? Will I kill him if I take it too without? This is risky. I will. I

551
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:33,430
think this is going to kill him, right? And then that's four. That should be it. Just to be safe.

552
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:54,619
I'm going to think that's it. I think I did it. Rattler, Reginald, tragic rat king. When their

553
01:50:54,619 --> 01:51:10,390
tangled bodies become corpses, you will gain four bones. I don't get it. What four bones instead of,

554
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:21,819
Oh, okay. So I just get, I feel like I'm, I need more bone cards though. I have tons of bones.

555
01:51:21,819 --> 01:51:44,220
You know what to do. I can't spend the bones. This is huge too. Card bearing the sigil damages

556
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:58,890
another creature. The creature perishes. That's pretty huge. Monkey W. That's pretty big. Yeah.

557
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:13,289
I'll take it. Should I get an item? I'm going to get an item. Gustrum. This may lift your creatures

558
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:24,460
into the air if only for a turn of fliers. That means like they can't be targeted or something.

559
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:32,869
This seems kind of cool. The creatures will attack as though they have the airborne. Oh,

560
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:42,569
that's amazing. I want that. Bleeding yields three blood if you can ignore the

561
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:59,819
beating. Wait, what's happening? Oh, but what, but what though? Black Oat is created in your hand.

562
01:52:59,819 --> 01:53:13,699
A black goat is defined as zero power, one health, worthy of sacrifice. It counts as three. It gives

563
01:53:13,699 --> 01:53:39,670
three blood. Okay. There we go. There we go. So this is going to spawn bees, airborne and

564
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:48,300
submerges. So this thing is going to be paying the ass. Okay. So this thing's, this thing I'm

565
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:53,420
never going to get rid of. Uh, so I'm going to deal with these two. Oh, a scream because

566
01:53:53,420 --> 01:54:16,619
it's a spider. How much health do you have? All right. Keep me alive. I'll try. And do you know

567
01:54:16,619 --> 01:55:00,520
what? Let's put a, uh, none of these are going to, uh, please go pee. I'm not going to use the goat.

568
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:09,750
I'm still confused on what this means. It costs one blood, but I'm confused at what, what the

569
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:16,060
point is. When this thing dies, what happens? Goat is better than the wolf. Use it and find out.

570
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:42,180
It gives worth three for a sacrifice. I don't, I don't get it. Cost one gives three. Um, so I get

571
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:52,859
to play more. Okay. Whatever. I'm kind of confused. Um, holy shit, Jeremy. I hold on. I'm sacrificing

572
01:55:52,859 --> 01:56:03,619
it is like sacrificing three cards. So is there like an indicator of how many I've sacrificed so

573
01:56:03,619 --> 01:56:12,229
far? So I can play. So if I put this goat down, if I need three blood, I just eat that and it counts

574
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:19,079
as three blood. It's worth three. Okay. It's the cost. Yeah. All right. That's what I thought it

575
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:26,779
was. I could just put this down and put this down too. I actually don't really know what the hell

576
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:43,859
to do right now. I don't think I want to use that now though. Like that's like a boss thing. I'm

577
01:56:43,859 --> 01:56:47,699
just going to do this and whatever happens happens here. Cause like I kind of been screwed here.

578
01:56:47,699 --> 01:56:57,100
This is probably a bad idea, but it is such a bad idea. This is a really bad idea, but who cares?

579
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:01,020
I'm full of bad ideas. This is a terrible idea. This is literally the worst move I could possibly

580
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:35,159
do. I think it is lost. Um, I don't know what to do. Let the wolf die. Yeah. I'm just going to farm,

581
01:57:35,159 --> 01:57:54,569
but I think I'm dead next turn. I'm just like dead next turn. I fucked up this whole round. Um,

582
01:57:54,569 --> 01:58:08,630
I think it's lose cause this can't. All right. So this card can never die, right? This can literally

583
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:21,739
not be killed. No matter what I can cut this card and get rid of it. So I will live if I put,

584
01:58:21,739 --> 01:58:30,890
but this goes over the bee. Is this bad to do? Let's just do it. Okay. So that's gone. This

585
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:34,729
can't attack it. This is going to do one damage regardless. This is going to hit the, all right.

586
01:58:34,729 --> 01:58:48,470
So let's do this. Let's just put this down like here and cause, uh, Oh my God, my brain. I just

587
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:56,260
don't, I can't. Well, the, will this bit lock it? Cause I need to tip the scales. Otherwise I'm

588
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:04,899
going to lose. E brain. Well, I mean, if I don't, I can't, if I don't tip the scales, I'm going to

589
01:59:04,899 --> 01:59:14,310
fucking lose. Right? What are you talking about? Cause if I could take one more damage, I think

590
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:25,979
I'm dead. I think that's what's happening here. Right? Like I kind of had to do that. Didn't I?

591
01:59:25,979 --> 01:59:36,760
All right. Ron saved. I can sacrifice the squirrel and the bee, kill both these motherfuckers over

592
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:59,420
here. I don't want to screw this up though. Let me get this right. Cause this is how I hate this.

593
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:08,739
I have to kill. This is going to die next turn. Do I wait until next turn to play me and just put

594
02:00:08,739 --> 02:00:22,489
the bee down because then I'll kill this. I'll put the bee down here and just, or let, I can't,

595
02:00:22,569 --> 02:00:28,409
I sacrifice this and kill this row. What I, this is the one that's going to Kurt kill me though.

596
02:00:28,409 --> 02:00:32,810
I don't know. I have no idea. I'm just going to fucking go for it. I have no idea. Like I

597
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:36,090
don't play these kinds of games. I don't play Hearthstone in bed every night. I do every night.

598
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:42,819
I have like 2000 hours in battlegrounds. All right. I'm going to put the bee down. No, I'm not.

599
02:00:42,819 --> 02:01:09,380
Oh, I just need to stop talking and just focus. Oh my God. What do I do? I'm fine. What was that?

600
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:16,520
I didn't want to, I didn't want you to do that. What the fuck was that? I didn't want you to do

601
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:45,399
that. I kind of blew everything, didn't it? All right. I'm going to kill this row here. Please be

602
02:01:45,399 --> 02:02:22,489
right. Please be right. I think this is right. Okay. Good. Okay. I'm good. Please. Let's get,

603
02:02:22,489 --> 02:02:28,550
let's get, let's just fucking look. Pay attention. It's like here, like a voice over here and a thing

604
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,750
over here. No, you go that way. You go that way. And I'm just like, no, no, no. Everyone,

605
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:39,270
everybody stop talking and let's, let's go. Is it, I got 18,000 people in my head and they're all you.

606
02:02:39,270 --> 02:03:04,390
All right. Kind of cool. For the beehive. I need bone consumption. I need bone. All right. I'm

607
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:25,930
almost at the boss. I can't, I don't have, I can't do items. Do I want to put in here? I mean,

608
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:46,810
that's, I could just get that on somebody or I could do this and then Ant Queen maybe. What about

609
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:59,800
the Gek? Holy shit. And I can play that for free. You suck at strats. I know. Oh, I know. Trust me.

610
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:07,239
All right. I got to pee. I'll be right back. Pee time. BRB. One second. Well, maybe like a minute

611
02:04:07,239 --> 02:10:15,300
or two. I'll keep this music on too. It's interesting. What happened? Oh, I see. Got minimized.

612
02:10:19,859 --> 02:10:37,619
Oops. Let's continue. Let's get this shit out of you. What? Sorry. Why is the, why was the music

613
02:10:37,619 --> 02:10:49,689
not on? That's kind of weird. Oh, it's because I hit the windows key. That's right. Oops. All right.

614
02:10:49,689 --> 02:11:01,159
So this is the boss. Let me get one chance. How smell invaded your nostrils and caused your throat

615
02:11:01,159 --> 02:11:11,510
to seize. Hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water. He pulled a

616
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:26,649
hook from a pile of rotting fish and rose to his feet. I am the angler. Go fish. The angler,

617
02:11:26,649 --> 02:11:33,220
mind his hook. Play a squirrel or something when he aims it. I will protect your best cards.

618
02:11:37,609 --> 02:11:52,100
Okay. He's not going to be happy about this one. All right. Everybody quiet. Everybody's silent.

619
02:11:54,890 --> 02:12:11,369
Okay. Here we go. This play thing. Go squirrel. No smoke. No. Squirrel. Squirrel going out.

620
02:12:11,369 --> 02:12:22,329
But again, still stink bug. I'm going out too. Oh, he did it wrong. He did it wrong. He did it

621
02:12:22,329 --> 02:12:46,409
wrong. He did it wrong. He did it wrong. Whatever. Which fish are choose. What's that mean? Um,

622
02:12:46,409 --> 02:13:01,109
can I put something on top of this? I don't get it. I don't get it. World. He's, he's saying he's

623
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:17,000
going to take this card. Um, what do I do about this? Pressure fish. Easy. Choose. Oh, okay. I

624
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:28,409
get it. Oh shit. No, I thought, I didn't know he moved again. I didn't know he moved it again.

625
02:13:28,409 --> 02:13:32,729
All right. I thought he just decided. Oh, okay. But what, what is he going to do about that?

626
02:13:32,729 --> 02:13:38,859
Oh, I'm in trouble now. Oh, I'm now, I'm in a lot of trouble. Okay. I, I messed it up. Wait. No,

627
02:13:38,859 --> 02:13:56,680
I didn't get it. Whatever. I didn't. Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

628
02:13:56,680 --> 02:14:20,229
I, I, I, that was good. That's not a bad move. Decent play. Really? All right. So if I do, uh,

629
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:33,260
Gecko's not good here though. Maybe it is because it'll kill that because if it kills that, he gets

630
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:40,010
the bones and then this won't attack me. And then I go like this and then I say, let's go.

631
02:14:40,810 --> 02:15:10,979
We're good. Stale fish. Hard choice. Um, wait, cause he's going to take that. If I play a card,

632
02:15:10,979 --> 02:15:21,340
he takes it. So I don't really care if he takes this because I could, he'll take the pelt. All

633
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:29,739
right. Let me see how dumb this is. If I go boom, boom, and then I put the pelt down. Okay. That's

634
02:15:29,739 --> 02:15:51,960
what I'm doing. Okay. Let's go. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and take that one. I don't give a shit.

635
02:15:51,960 --> 02:16:07,180
Oh, wait. Does it shuffle the board? It does. Okay. Go fish. Uh, he just gets a free turn.

636
02:16:07,899 --> 02:16:11,500
I will use this opportunity to pull a, um, a scout and end my turn.

637
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:25,960
Oh my God. What did happen? What the hell is that? Um, okay. This is bad.

638
02:16:35,700 --> 02:17:04,659
Uh, I need bones. That's bad. Not good. Four, five. I don't think that's enough. Is it enough?

639
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:17,020
I sacrifice a squirrel and do the fan. Is that enough? That's enough? Sacrifice. Huh?

640
02:17:17,579 --> 02:17:31,379
Enough. Wait, hold on. Everyone relax. Sacrifice. Yeah. What happened? Wait, does this come back?

641
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:36,659
No, no, no, no. This doesn't, that doesn't work like that. What do you mean?

642
02:17:37,299 --> 02:17:43,700
You use, hold on. Yes. I hope you guys aren't lying to me.

643
02:17:46,569 --> 02:18:07,049
Did I do it? And do the fan now. And there's four or five. Is that enough? Just end your turn. But

644
02:18:07,049 --> 02:18:23,270
are they going to hit shit? You win. You win. You win. You win. What? Oh my God. I thought. Okay.

645
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:27,620
The reason why I freaked out is because I thought he was going to hit this for some reason.

646
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:31,610
Relight your candles. Thank you. I thought he was going to hit that. Okay.

647
02:18:31,610 --> 02:18:47,290
Didn't need to even use the fan. Okay. Another larva. This thing.

648
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:57,219
Wild 13. Doesn't die when sacrificed, but you have the heart to try.

649
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:19,530
So it just stays on the board forever. I feel like I can't already have a couple of these,

650
02:19:19,530 --> 02:19:35,260
don't I? In a way. I'll take the larva. Why not? Dinner would have to wait. Let me see.

651
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:45,100
Bridget gust of wind billowed unwelcome into your lungs. Beauty of the falling snow failed to

652
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:53,620
distract you from the chill in your bones. You had to send it to the snow line. Plus you got in your

653
02:19:53,620 --> 02:20:28,840
fucked up little room here. Um, finally pried my special dagger from the paws of that squirrel,

654
02:20:28,840 --> 02:21:06,090
though you may wish that you hadn't. What can I do with that? I have an item now. Smoke.

655
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:19,180
You have the knife. Okay. Yeah. I use it on the, do I have to sit down? That one's only for card

656
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:34,229
dueling. You encountered a small outpost in the woods tended by a mysterious woman. It was the

657
02:21:34,229 --> 02:21:42,520
trader that the old trapper had mentioned. Her appearance was unsettling, but you were mollified

658
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:52,420
by her offering. Do you mind if I examine those pelts of yours? Start with you hair pelts. Here's

659
02:21:52,420 --> 02:22:11,000
what I can offer. I can trade you any of these. Take your time. You may search your deck or any

660
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:20,809
card and take it into your hand when you play this. That seems really good. Ringworm. This

661
02:22:20,809 --> 02:22:27,500
thing kind of sucks. What does this thing do? This thing's terrible. I think I want the coyote

662
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:37,860
because I have things that generate bones. I have barely any bone spenders. This thing doesn't even

663
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:54,569
have a description. Bagpie. Yeah. Magpie is good too. I don't have any bone spenders. I have all

664
02:22:54,569 --> 02:22:58,090
these things generating bones, but they just sit on the table. Okay. The last like three or four

665
02:22:58,090 --> 02:23:09,209
games, I had like four or five, six bones just sitting there. I'm thinking about taking mantis

666
02:23:09,209 --> 02:23:26,649
just so I can sacrifice it and give it to somebody else. Is that a golden pelt? Magnificent. Deus.

667
02:23:30,059 --> 02:23:34,139
Chime is created on each empty adjacent space. The chime is defined as zero. So when you put

668
02:23:34,139 --> 02:23:57,590
it down to zero one. Oh man. So this just kind of gets in the way or it's a random card. Two

669
02:23:57,590 --> 02:24:26,860
seven. Oh, oh, this is just like a tank. I'll take the tank. Who the hell is this? Who's that?

670
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:46,809
Choice is yours. Who is this? It's me. Okay. So I'm going to give the spreading move. Will this kill

671
02:24:46,809 --> 02:25:01,340
everything? This will kill two things, right? That's kind of a big deal. That's a huge deal.

672
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:25,670
That's three bones too. Perfect. I don't know what this is. We haven't seen it yet. FD.

673
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:41,510
Creatures in the way get pushed. That's kind of scary. So this is going to move forward.

674
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:46,229
So I should try. I got to get. How many bones do I have? I only have one bone. That'll be two.

675
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:59,450
If I put Reginald here and they come down, it'll kill them both. All right. I need to think about

676
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:10,299
this. Oh, let's just put something out there. I'll put the skink here. Right? Yeah. Right.

677
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:30,979
Is that stupid? I think that's it. Yeah. Then that's a bone and then it's two bones. I can't

678
02:26:31,299 --> 02:26:33,059
do anything else really. So we're just gonna go.

679
02:26:35,459 --> 02:26:48,090
So that's your three. Unfortunately, I will kill these two. Let's go ahead and get that out of the

680
02:26:48,090 --> 02:26:54,059
way. Let me draw first. I'll draw a scroll. All right. Reginald's going here. That'll kill both

681
02:26:54,059 --> 02:27:05,799
of these and I need to put something over here. No, I can just wait. What does the knife do?

682
02:27:05,799 --> 02:27:14,569
You will place a weight on the scales. Pain is temporary. Okay. So that'd be like,

683
02:27:14,569 --> 02:27:26,979
point point. I gotta draw something, right? That's kind of bad, isn't it?

684
02:27:40,569 --> 02:27:50,870
It's me. Okay. Hi. You're really kind of screwing this up. Oh, I think it is when I just went.

685
02:27:51,510 --> 02:28:03,379
It's not a bad play. I just win right now. Hey, what? Hey, what are you talking about? Oh,

686
02:28:03,379 --> 02:28:25,510
it gets in the way of right. Okay. Whatever. I win right now because that'll be it's zero.

687
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:30,309
It's going to go, I'm just going to sacrifice these guys. No, I'm not. I'll win next turn. Who

688
02:28:30,309 --> 02:29:16,020
cares? Yeah, I'll win this time. Yeah. Good for you. What is happening right now? I might,

689
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:21,670
I might be able to do this. If I go boom, boom and go this way, it might be a victory already,

690
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:46,540
right? I think that's a win. I do that. That's one, two, then I can do two, which would go

691
02:29:46,780 --> 02:30:17,500
here. Hey, I think I just won. I didn't. No, I win the game. I win. I win. The game's over. I win.

692
02:30:18,139 --> 02:30:32,139
I win. The game's over. The game's over. I win. It's fine. Whatever. What's this?

693
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:54,069
I have the most exquisite pelts. I got a lot of teeth. First one's free. Don't buy more. Yeah.

694
02:30:54,069 --> 02:30:59,780
Isn't this going to just kind of load up my deck with a bunch of shit? Maybe just buy this one.

695
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:09,530
I feel like this is going to load my deck up with a bunch of crap. I'm going to buy the gold one and

696
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:43,639
that's it. All right. What am I sacrificing? Mole man or larva? Mole has two effects. Yeah,

697
02:31:43,639 --> 02:31:53,979
I don't know. I feel like this would be cool though. Mole man can make somebody crazy.

698
02:31:53,979 --> 02:32:11,370
That one's good too. Yeah. This one's good because then I can put it on. Oh, it would not,

699
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:15,770
it would not hit whoever it was and they would move out of the way. And okay, I wonder maybe the,

700
02:32:15,770 --> 02:32:24,700
maybe the mole man or larva. Yeah, that's a good one because then this will absolutely live one

701
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:38,329
turn and then transform. I'm starting to get it a little more. Although games like this really kind

702
02:32:38,329 --> 02:32:51,639
of nerve wracking for me. All right. You got a mole man, but this pushes in direction. This one

703
02:32:51,639 --> 02:33:05,659
will always be a tank. So I keep, I, that was the scream at the bug joke. I wonder if I even do

704
02:33:05,659 --> 02:33:14,840
anything or just skip. I think I'm just going to skip or something. Yeah. Cause if I put this down,

705
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:31,079
I feel like he's just going to die like immediately. And I guess I'm just going to do this ever.

706
02:33:31,079 --> 02:33:50,969
Ow. That hurts a lot. Again with this shit draw. Oh my God. I'm going to kill this and I'll get

707
02:33:51,049 --> 02:33:59,239
free. If he's going to kill this anyways, and why not just be able to put something out,

708
02:33:59,239 --> 02:34:04,389
use the knife. I could. All right. Hold on. If he's going to kill this anyways,

709
02:34:04,389 --> 02:34:12,569
why not just me kill it, be able to play the coyote next turn. Cause he's going to kill the

710
02:34:12,569 --> 02:34:20,440
ant instead or wait till the queen comes up. I thought I had a lot of bone. Yeah. I thought I

711
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:28,979
did too. I thought I had a lot of bone makers. I'm going to, uh, whatever. If I lose, I lose.

712
02:34:28,979 --> 02:34:35,079
I'm going to see what happens if I do this. Like this could be stupid, but what up? I'm going to

713
02:34:35,079 --> 02:34:52,940
try it. I got the four. Okay. Now let's pull this. All right. So now I got to do one. It's

714
02:34:52,940 --> 02:35:01,579
going to bounce off this anyways. So I'm going to have to put a pelt down. Pelt down here. Coyote.

715
02:35:01,579 --> 02:35:07,770
It doesn't really matter where the coyote goes, right? So whatever. I'm in, I'm in trouble,

716
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:43,110
but what am I going to do about it? Oh my God. I'm like going to die. I think I might have to

717
02:35:43,110 --> 02:36:14,250
open this. What does the knife do? Uh, okay. I can't do anything else. So, um, oh, I'm so

718
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:18,010
fucked. How am I supposed to do about this? That's how he had so much such an advantage.

719
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:26,700
I'm just dead. I'm going to lose. I, he started, I started, I, all the bones fucking ruined this

720
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:34,659
run. What did I say? Oh, hey guys, I didn't buy it. Get a bunch of bones. Cause I have so many bones,

721
02:36:34,659 --> 02:36:46,379
uh, creators. I had like, I'm just dead. It's all right. I lose. What am I going to do here besides

722
02:36:46,379 --> 02:36:57,690
this? I mean, I could just sit here and get killed. I'm not going to, this is over. I mean,

723
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:10,229
might as well just open this and see what it does. So I put this down. This is worth. So if I do this,

724
02:37:10,229 --> 02:37:17,799
I get three blood. You have two lives. Oh my goodness. I do. Right. It's only for bosses when

725
02:37:17,799 --> 02:37:29,079
he blows out the candle. So what, what should I do here? Kill the squirrel with this, put down the

726
02:37:29,079 --> 02:37:50,420
queen or kill the coyote and go queen rattler. Okay. So who should I, if I sacrifice the squirrel,

727
02:37:50,420 --> 02:37:55,000
then it's fine, right? Cause I'm still kind of confused how this works. So I, I'll get three.

728
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:09,420
So put that down. This is now, I can put this down here. I sacrifice this and then

729
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:17,430
let's be put this. I don't want this to die immediately, but I'm going to fucking

730
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:38,680
the ant down. Um, I don't know. World queen to ant bones. Um, did I not draw a card yet?

731
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:52,940
So should I kill the coyote? Like all this? Okay. I actually have no idea what's going on.

732
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:59,899
I, I'm just fucking dead anyways. I got to lose anyways. Like I'm not like I couldn't do anything

733
02:38:59,899 --> 02:39:09,540
about it. I blow a candle out. Not disappointing. Believe it or not. You're not the first to lose

734
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:21,079
an eye here. Not much fun if you're half blind. Like to replace it perhaps. Oh, I wanted to see

735
02:39:21,079 --> 02:39:30,629
what it looked like. I didn't get a chance to look at it. Choice is final. Okay. Wait, I get to keep

736
02:39:30,629 --> 02:39:54,020
going. I wait, hold on a minute. I definitely don't want this, the goat. So it doesn't store it though.

737
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:59,860
So if I put this down and I use something that costs two blood, it's not like I get to keep

738
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:11,639
the other one blood in reserve. It just like up to three. So I have, okay. I understand. I get it.

739
02:40:11,639 --> 02:40:15,909
So you would only want to use this if you had something that had at least two or more.

740
02:40:15,909 --> 02:40:25,450
I get it. I get it. I understand. What does this do? This one's kind of interesting.

741
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:28,729
This is way too many bones. I need to get some, I need to do something. That's not,

742
02:40:28,729 --> 02:40:53,319
I'm actually just take this or this is, I need damage. My deck kind of sucks before I'm gone

743
02:40:53,319 --> 02:41:16,379
here. I don't get it. Okay. So this is health. Please know larva. Oh man. One three with poison

744
02:41:16,379 --> 02:41:37,049
or Richard old one three with poison is pretty ridiculous. Yeah. And it's free. I would love to

745
02:41:37,049 --> 02:41:49,110
see it. Let me see it right now. All right. This is not a bad start. Do you not have anything?

746
02:41:49,110 --> 02:42:03,770
Okay. What do you got? Turkey. Okay. This is this annoying thing. All right. So I'm okay. I'm going

747
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:08,090
to put the, I'm going to put out me next turn. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We'll put a mole

748
02:42:08,090 --> 02:42:20,329
man out right now. Let's go. Oh man. Or do I just wait till next turn? Like it's too late now.

749
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:30,420
Ah, I died. Oh my God. What am I doing? What happened? I don't know what I fucking did.

750
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:39,190
I thought I think I die anyways. Even if I didn't sacrifice the mole man. Yeah. Yeah. Stay there.

751
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:45,370
No need to move. I am afraid you are not dead yet. Yeah. Hold still. Where did I put that

752
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:59,989
camera of mine? Stop taking pictures. You don't have 30 HP. This is an art stone. I know, but

753
02:43:59,989 --> 02:44:08,979
still, man, I took a picture. Wait, did I just take a picture of this guy? You really think I

754
02:44:08,979 --> 02:44:13,959
would leave film in there? Do you have any idea what that camera is capable of? Give me that.

755
02:44:13,959 --> 02:44:30,920
We have a memento to create. Behold your. Oh, I do a new one every turn. Oh no. I had a good one

756
02:44:30,920 --> 02:45:00,729
last time. Cost? This is free. Power and health in the rattler. 31 sigils. I feel like the wolf

757
02:45:00,729 --> 02:45:26,790
is better. Good Riddler. That's such a stupid. Fine. One thing remains. It must capture your

758
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:48,700
photo or whatever. Jeez. Oh, raid just came in. What? Hold on a minute. I got to correct this.

759
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:52,459
This is like, wait, this is like white. The light is white. I need to change that. That's why I look

760
02:45:52,459 --> 02:46:22,860
like a fucking skeleton today. Hold on. Big raid. Big raid. Laniya Lazar. Lazar. I fucking said that's

761
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:42,950
so wrong. I'm so sorry that I oh my God, that's so fucking embarrassing and stupid. Thank you so

762
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:51,860
much for the raid. Welcome everybody. I look like such a fucking dickhead right now. Thank you so

763
02:46:51,860 --> 02:47:02,010
much for the raid. Welcome everybody. It's a big raid. Yeah, if you don't know a lot, it's a Vtuber.

764
02:47:02,010 --> 02:47:09,350
I've seen, I've watched. You don't think I don't know who that is? You don't think I don't know?

765
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:22,280
Now it's time for an apology. Here's the thing. Let me explain. I'm so sorry. I looked over here

766
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:28,950
and I just, my brain just immediately started reading and it's like I looked over and it just

767
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:39,159
was Laniya Lazar. I'm such a fucking dumbass. My brain has trouble sometimes, but I do appreciate

768
02:47:39,159 --> 02:47:46,090
thanks. Welcome everybody. We're playing, uh, playing Inscription. Apology song. I'm not singing

769
02:47:46,090 --> 02:48:13,299
an apology song to anybody. No. No apology song. Oh, I can see the music. Okay. You will learn as

770
02:48:13,299 --> 02:48:22,889
we go or you will die. Hope you had a good stream though. Thank you. You see, he was defeated

771
02:48:22,889 --> 02:48:34,409
recently and wishes to redeem himself. Ear wax in your eyes. My ears are clean. Relax. It would be

772
02:48:34,409 --> 02:48:39,219
unfortunate if you were to fall to the prospector before he was given that chance. This hook is

773
02:48:39,219 --> 02:48:44,819
powerful. You may steal one of my cards with it. For that reason, you will not find any others along

774
02:48:44,819 --> 02:48:56,120
the path. Use it wisely. It seems the lowly stink bug has made its way in, but it is dealt so it

775
02:48:56,200 --> 02:49:05,780
stands. What's going on? What's happening to everybody? Why are they all messed up? What

776
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:24,459
happened? I get to pick one. Yeah. Why is his head turning into a square? This is my deck right now.

777
02:49:24,459 --> 02:49:31,399
Ah, I see. So, so let me guess it. So I beat two bosses, but the game is like, okay, you beat two

778
02:49:31,399 --> 02:49:35,239
bosses. So we're just going to get you on the path to the last one you beat before the area you were

779
02:49:35,239 --> 02:49:50,819
just in. Is that how that works? So I have to beat the angler again. No, I'm such a fucking idiot.

780
02:49:50,819 --> 02:50:01,909
No, you may not choose a specific beast. Instead, you must now decide on a tribe that you prefer.

781
02:50:01,909 --> 02:50:25,110
Yeah, I'm gonna go with insect. A randomly chosen insect card. Do you wish for something else?

782
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:44,979
What's wrong with insects? This game is crazy. I think the rules are kind of changing. Choose.

783
02:50:44,979 --> 02:51:12,200
What am I choosing? This is for the cockroach card, which would be, this would be unkillable. Okay.

784
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:21,379
The old woman bared her teeth in satisfaction. Your first totem was complete. Many lives sigil

785
02:51:21,379 --> 02:51:33,239
will now be marked upon all your squirrel creatures. Huh? If you lose this run, you are

786
02:51:33,239 --> 02:51:53,979
fucked. I'm probably gonna man. Oh, oh, what the fuck, man? Is this what that looked like?

787
02:51:53,979 --> 02:52:19,340
This is what that looked like. Holy shit. Looks like Dr. Robotnik. Somebody put a mustache right

788
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:53,639
here. Somebody put a mustache right there. That's fucked. Jesus. Hey. All right. So this thing,

789
02:52:53,639 --> 02:52:59,829
what does this do again? What happened? So this can't die. So I can sacrifice a hundred times.

790
02:52:59,829 --> 02:53:22,969
Hold on. Let me test this. So if I do bullfrog on this. What? Really? Oh, okay. How do I get rid

791
02:53:22,969 --> 02:53:46,950
of them? But if it can't die, then okay. All right, dude. Relax here. Um, all right. I gotta do this.

792
02:53:50,700 --> 02:54:03,319
Yeah. And then stink bug. I'm gonna save the stink bug because I'll put that out after this.

793
02:54:03,959 --> 02:54:10,379
He sucks. I, dude, I, I don't, what do you, I don't know, man. Like I'm just trying to play the game.

794
02:54:10,379 --> 02:54:18,309
I suck asshole at card games. Did you watch me play Hearthstone? Did you watch me play Hearthstone?

795
02:54:18,309 --> 02:54:23,190
I just sometimes just put cards down because they look pretty. I, they look nice. I don't know. I,

796
02:54:23,190 --> 02:54:47,500
by math in my head, I'm doing fine. I'm doing fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Total misplay.

797
02:54:47,500 --> 02:55:09,620
Shut up. Again, I have to pick another. All right. So I'm doing insect again because it's an insect

798
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:28,840
build. Ant. Okay. Cool. I got a lot of teeth. Okay. Gently shaking hands. She placed her

799
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:38,299
offerings before you. Another offering. Uh, what's, I don't know. What am I picking here?

800
02:55:38,299 --> 02:55:42,659
Okay. What does the snake head do? I didn't want to, I didn't want to pick the snake head. I just

801
02:55:42,659 --> 02:55:47,049
want to see what it did. I don't know what, what, I don't know what I just did. What just happened?

802
02:55:47,049 --> 02:56:06,629
I don't know what just happened. I wanted to look. What do I do? What, how do I fix this? Um,

803
02:56:06,629 --> 02:56:18,069
eat the squirrel head. I don't understand what's happening. Do I click the squirrel head? Press S

804
02:56:18,069 --> 02:56:22,360
keep squirrels. Does this mean I'm keeping the squirrel right here? Or does this mean I'm

805
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:36,870
keeping the squirrel? Click the squirrel. Now click this. Okay. I thought I could look at that.

806
02:56:36,870 --> 02:56:41,510
No, dude. Okay. I wanted to read it. I thought I could read to see what it was going to do.

807
02:56:45,030 --> 02:56:55,450
I just wanted to read it. I, it was like a snake head. I didn't know what that did. It's for

808
02:56:55,450 --> 02:57:04,170
lizards. Right click to see it. I didn't have a book on it. All right. What do you got? Okay.

809
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:09,370
So it's going to go forward and then this way. I don't want anything right here, right? I want it

810
02:57:09,370 --> 02:57:15,219
like here. Well, that was a dumb thing that I just did. I literally just said, don't put it there.

811
02:57:15,219 --> 02:58:54,649
Bro, please. What? We got a good one. This looks like I have boogers coming out of my nose.

812
02:58:54,649 --> 02:59:56,870
This one's good, but I'm not bald. Nosebleed. Uh, mantis. Who health? Who's wisely? The ant or the

813
02:59:56,870 --> 03:00:19,100
wolf. Probably this would be good. This would be three, four for the mantis. One, four. Awkward

814
03:00:19,100 --> 03:00:22,620
should be interesting because it was never, it would just always, but yeah, I think this would

815
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:34,620
kind of get in the way, wouldn't it? This would last too long, I think. Four bones. I'm not

816
03:00:34,620 --> 03:01:01,590
bone generating. Put it on the mantis. What's this shit? All right. There's two birds. Uh,

817
03:01:01,590 --> 03:01:20,170
I think I'm going to get this out here first. Oh shit. I need it. Okay. You don't get tokens for

818
03:01:20,170 --> 03:02:04,100
that, huh? You back on the board. Yep. Ooh, wolf. All right. Uh, who do I want to get rid of you?

819
03:02:04,100 --> 03:02:24,790
Cause you'll kill this whole row and that's good. That should be good to go. It should be good to

820
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:35,989
go. All right. Three. That'll kill, that won't kill this, but I think we're good. Don't read it

821
03:02:35,989 --> 03:02:45,260
again. I'm not going to read it again. Ooh, mantis. Mantis in replace of the ant. It's just a better

822
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:57,590
ant. I mean, it's just a better ant and it'll hit. Yeah, let's do it. I wish I could get rid of this

823
03:02:57,590 --> 03:03:20,889
game over. Let's see if I can do a ton of damage though. Cockroach. Nah, that's it. That's a lot of

824
03:03:20,889 --> 03:03:41,110
gold. Elk fawn, Reginald again, and a river snapper. I mean, we have to take, and then we just

825
03:03:41,110 --> 03:03:56,340
sacrifice. We're putting Reginald up to sacrifice now, right? Cause I'm generating very much bone

826
03:03:56,340 --> 03:04:15,700
or that would be huge too. Cockroach or Reginald, which one? Who do I want to give that to? I mean,

827
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:33,860
probably mantis or probably Reginald. Maybe the mantis. Wolf is good. That's just very clean

828
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:54,200
though. Very clean. Ant. I don't, I don't have a queen ant though. I'm going mantis. I don't have

829
03:04:54,200 --> 03:05:16,280
a queen ant. Okay. So this is the angler again, right? Hold on. I have to play the whole game

830
03:05:16,280 --> 03:05:45,190
over again when I lose. It's a roguelike. That mule. Yep. I know what I'm doing. All right. Let's go.

831
03:05:46,659 --> 03:06:34,120
Squirrel going out. You. Boom. You. Boom. Bullfrog. Stay. Okay. Now I get four bones when this is

832
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:48,739
broken. There we are. There we are. Check this out. We go one, two, smack that. We go one, two,

833
03:06:49,819 --> 03:07:02,139
smack into that. We go. Let's see if I care. I don't care. Mantis. Good. Mantis is going to go.

834
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:13,219
I wish I could get rid of this. I don't want to. I wish I could delete the boulder.

835
03:07:13,219 --> 03:07:38,020
Just don't just leave because he's going to kill everything. Yep. This is a jump. No,

836
03:07:43,639 --> 03:07:48,520
can't do anything because it's just stuff in the way. So whatever. Just kill it please.

837
03:07:48,920 --> 03:08:13,399
All right. Now. Perfect. Go and kill that please. Please hit that. I can't play anything.

838
03:08:13,399 --> 03:08:33,989
I can't play anything. Just hit me. Thank you. I can't play a squirrel otherwise. I have too

839
03:08:33,989 --> 03:08:45,579
many squirrels. I can't do anything still. I could do this. What am I going to do with all these?

840
03:08:53,450 --> 03:09:29,860
All right. No. Use them as tanks. I can just do that. Yeah, that's over. How many levels are in

841
03:09:29,860 --> 03:09:47,739
the game? Like how many areas? How many bosses are in the game? 20? When do you, how do you like

842
03:09:47,739 --> 03:09:58,420
four? It's complicated. Don't ask that question. Okay. Brutant pack rat never dealt the utility

843
03:09:58,420 --> 03:10:08,489
of a well-stocked pack. When a card bearing this is played, you will receive a random item as long

844
03:10:08,489 --> 03:10:29,909
as your pack is not full. It seems broken. I just get an item every time I play the card.

845
03:10:33,690 --> 03:10:36,569
All right. This is the last one I'm going to show. This is the last one I'm going to show.

846
03:10:36,569 --> 03:10:53,620
I'm not showing anymore. Let's be very clear. This is the last one that we're going to show.

847
03:10:53,620 --> 03:11:29,500
No more after this one. Yes. It's the funniest movie of the year. Let me think. The air grew thick

848
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:48,329
with void. All right. This is the, the angler. Wetlands. Pinky black mouth of a cave. Strange

849
03:11:48,329 --> 03:11:55,799
beast lurked within. Spoke past one of my, did anybody have one? I did that like two years ago.

850
03:11:56,809 --> 03:12:03,219
The clip of the, it's the funniest movie of the year. That was a joke we did, right?

851
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:13,530
Anybody have that clip? It was like a Bernie Sanders political ad, right?

852
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:22,840
Nobody cared enough. I thought that, I thought that was a great one. Pass one of my trials and

853
03:12:22,840 --> 03:12:32,069
I'll be yours in a raspy voice. Three creatures will be drawn from your deck. They will decide

854
03:12:32,069 --> 03:12:43,500
your success or failure, but first you will choose a trial. Trial of bones. The three drawn cards

855
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:51,770
must cost at least five bones combined to pass. Three drawn cards must have at least six health

856
03:12:51,770 --> 03:13:07,770
combined to pass or at least three sigils among them to pass. We got it right here. Bernie approves

857
03:13:07,770 --> 03:13:15,000
this message. Funniest movie of the year. Is this it? Sanders and I approve this message. My name

858
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:22,340
is Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. It's the funniest movie of the year. Critics

859
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:33,879
at Bernie Sanders are saying it's the best movie in February. Sonic the Hedgehog. Pretty PG.

860
03:13:33,879 --> 03:13:49,670
Yeah, that's pretty funny. I like that was funny. What's wrong with that? All right. It's probably

861
03:13:49,670 --> 03:14:04,579
health. I'm going to say health or sigils and I have like five. Every single one of my cards has

862
03:14:04,579 --> 03:14:15,540
a sigil, doesn't it? I think it's I'm doing this one. I did it twice. How many times did I do that?

863
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:30,540
Hold on. There's a different one. It's the funniest movie of the year. That's not the same. Critics

864
03:14:30,540 --> 03:14:40,889
are saying it's the best VR game of 2020. I've done that. Whatever. It's a funny routine. That's

865
03:14:40,889 --> 03:15:01,239
a funny routine. I don't care. I think I'll do it again too. Got it. So what do I get for this?

866
03:15:01,319 --> 03:15:14,469
Um, this is what is this? When a car, but this is so I get four bones and this dies

867
03:15:14,469 --> 03:15:21,290
and it's got quills. This is underwater. So it's like stealth. That's actually kind of amazing,

868
03:15:21,290 --> 03:15:28,389
but eight bones. Oh, that's way too much. Or copies comes back when it dies and it has that.

869
03:15:28,389 --> 03:15:35,370
That one's not that great. I picked one of these two. Probably this one. Eight bones. When am I

870
03:15:35,370 --> 03:15:49,510
ever going to have eight bones? I'm going to pick this one. Hmm. The amount of items you can carry

871
03:15:49,510 --> 03:15:58,569
is three. And do you have three? Instead, perhaps you'll accept this gift from my friend.

872
03:15:58,569 --> 03:16:09,020
Another pack rat? All right. All right. That's looking pretty good. I got two of these. Dude,

873
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:19,049
you fell off. You were using old jokes. I didn't, I just was remembering an old one. Okay. So this

874
03:16:19,049 --> 03:16:29,190
is, so I might as well just use something, right? Because if I get an item, I might as well use

875
03:16:29,190 --> 03:16:42,420
something. What does this one do again? No, I want, book one of my cards and take it as your own.

876
03:16:42,420 --> 03:16:47,979
I'm not going to use the knife. That's probably going to come in handy later. I don't think I'm

877
03:16:47,979 --> 03:16:51,340
going to use that. The knife, but the squirrel, probably the squirrel. Cause what the fuck? Who

878
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:56,979
cares? I have so many infinite squirrels. Yeah. What am I going to do with that? Here you go. Now

879
03:16:56,979 --> 03:17:03,450
let's play and check this out. Ready? Watch this. This is something fucking crazy. I'll show you

880
03:17:03,450 --> 03:17:31,450
right now. Bingo. Done. Flyers. Done. That's fine. I want you to kill it anyways. One, three. This

881
03:17:31,450 --> 03:17:51,450
spot. You sure? Yeah. Don't question me. This is okay. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine.

882
03:17:51,450 --> 03:18:09,079
I'll kill that. Okay. No, sorry. That'll die. This won't get killed next turn. And then, oh,

883
03:18:09,079 --> 03:18:18,979
I just win. I think, oh, I just win in a minute. I was rip a tooth out and just get another, um,

884
03:18:18,979 --> 03:18:46,059
I think I fucked it up. Okay. Uh, I think I just have to go. All right. How can I kill now?

885
03:18:46,059 --> 03:19:00,280
Stink bug is one, two. I will kill that. Pack rat. I really want that stump to die. Oh, there we go.

886
03:19:00,280 --> 03:19:06,780
Okay. Game over. But should I, I'm going to get an item first. Oh, who cares? Just fucking win.

887
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:14,780
Just one. Yeah. Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit, right? Yeah. Who gives a shit? Wait, who gives

888
03:19:14,780 --> 03:19:34,219
a shit, right? Whatever. Who gives a shit? I win. I don't want a bullfrog. I don't know if I want

889
03:19:34,219 --> 03:19:48,379
that. Ooh, I'll take this one. Mushroom land. Thick and pungent mushrooms. You squint to see a figure

890
03:19:48,379 --> 03:19:58,899
through a thick cloud of spores. We are the mysologists. Yes. And we are performing our

891
03:19:58,899 --> 03:20:08,329
experiments far from. We are not welcome elsewhere. We will experiment on your flock. Yes. We will need

892
03:20:08,329 --> 03:20:32,600
two of the same creature. I have two pack rats. This could get messy. Look away. Oh, that's pretty

893
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:43,700
huge. That's a big deal. I'll take it. Does the sigil stack? That would be amazing if it did. I

894
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:53,899
don't know. All right. We've got B. These are going to fly over me, so it doesn't matter. I'll put

895
03:20:53,899 --> 03:21:48,250
out here. We'll go blink and doesn't really matter. So the blink. It's fine. All right. Pack this up.

896
03:22:01,770 --> 03:22:48,620
Oops. Fuck. I think I screwed this up. I'm in a lot of trouble now. I need to do. I'm just so bad

897
03:22:48,620 --> 03:22:54,149
with like placement and like thinking two, three turns ahead in games like these. There's no car I

898
03:22:54,149 --> 03:23:04,600
can just drive into like a wall. You know what I mean? Like I have trouble with these. Stink bug

899
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:10,840
is going to drop down. Put the stink bug here, right? Because then if this take this can't do

900
03:23:10,840 --> 03:23:23,370
anything, I might just be dead. I think I just lose. I'd have to use the knife. Yeah, I have to.

901
03:23:23,370 --> 03:23:56,979
Okay. Now it's sold. Oh, I fucked it up. I whatever. It doesn't matter. I just I have so much

902
03:23:56,979 --> 03:24:03,639
trouble like thinking two or three turns ahead and like, I don't know. ADHD is just like, well,

903
03:24:03,639 --> 03:24:16,149
what do these do again? I don't remember. All right. Okay. If I get hit one more time,

904
03:24:16,149 --> 03:24:32,620
it's over. That's two. I pull another squirrel hook something just too many, too many options

905
03:24:32,620 --> 03:24:48,010
for my brain to focus on. Use the rat. Yeah, but I just okay. I wish I could just like pull the

906
03:24:48,010 --> 03:24:58,469
camera out. You know what I mean? I wish I could see my hand and the board at the same time. So

907
03:24:58,469 --> 03:25:07,819
I wonder if I should. Okay. I got to make a fucking play here. I get to sit here. I can't

908
03:25:07,819 --> 03:25:16,360
just hit her and cycle menus. This is to if I go bang, I'm going to pull a squirrel. Fuck it.

909
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:28,420
Whatever. I'm going to die anyways. Oh, squirrel bang bang. That'll kill this whole row and then

910
03:25:28,420 --> 03:25:37,899
see what happens. I guess. Oh shit. It's going to went over right. Oh, fuck. It's not much

911
03:25:37,899 --> 03:26:01,049
trouble. What's this new item? I just want to look over there. I don't know to do. I could fishing

912
03:26:01,049 --> 03:26:19,829
hook the which I fishing at the stump or the be D to look at items or damage. Yeah, but is it going

913
03:26:19,829 --> 03:26:49,399
to? All right, let's go. I don't think I do anything. I'm kind of screwed because I can't

914
03:26:49,399 --> 03:26:55,530
get rid of those squirrels. I could use this here. All right, I'm going to try. I'm going to go for

915
03:26:55,530 --> 03:27:37,959
this. I draw this. All right, Wolf 32. I can't remove this shit. I think that's going to do it.

916
03:27:37,959 --> 03:27:48,069
Yeah. Yeah, I just my brain is so much trouble. Just so I never play games like this because it's

917
03:27:48,069 --> 03:27:56,020
like I just get lost looking at like the cards and then I go. Wait, I don't even know what to do.

918
03:27:56,020 --> 03:28:09,620
Let's take this one. Happy with that one. Find salvation. Cuckoo clock. I didn't already do

919
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:47,290
the clock. I did the clock already bugs. Take the film roll before he sees it now. What are you

920
03:28:47,290 --> 03:28:56,649
doing over there? He's self gaslighting. I just you give me a dodge roll and I'll fucking beat

921
03:28:56,649 --> 03:29:02,200
that game. All right, I got film for the camera. So does it mean can I take a picture of him now?

922
03:29:02,200 --> 03:29:34,790
He's gaslighting himself. Don't look around some more. One. What is this for? Oh my God, that's

923
03:29:34,790 --> 03:30:13,290
fucking weird. I did that. Is the eyes turning on do anything? Does this mean anything to do the

924
03:30:13,290 --> 03:30:25,559
game board puzzles? I did all of them already. I did them all. I already because this there was

925
03:30:25,559 --> 03:30:43,659
a card here before. I don't know what it was. I keep going. I think I have full items.

926
03:30:43,659 --> 03:30:55,159
So let's go this way. Move with a certain figure in spite of her considerable age. Yeah. So this

927
03:30:55,159 --> 03:31:04,659
is this I don't want to do anything about this, right? Keep the squirrel. Yeah, I don't really

928
03:31:04,659 --> 03:31:18,059
want to. I guess I could have gone to the backpack. Fix the squirrel. I'll keep the squirrel head

929
03:31:18,059 --> 03:31:30,549
though. Is it bug build? The squirrel I think is fucking me up. I keep putting out too many and

930
03:31:30,549 --> 03:31:36,069
then I just like I get like overwhelmed with what I need to do next turn. Maybe I should try the

931
03:31:36,069 --> 03:31:53,719
bug. You'll get used to it. You need two cost cards in your deck. I'll try. I'll keep it.

932
03:31:53,719 --> 03:32:01,739
Let me try the bug. I'm just curious what this does. I have like a yeah I'm gonna try. I have a

933
03:32:01,739 --> 03:32:19,700
ton of bugs. Half my deck is bugs. Let me try it. I can always put it back on, right? I oughta thank

934
03:32:19,700 --> 03:32:27,510
you. How has it been? It has been what is going on with this guy? I'm trapped in the body of a stote

935
03:32:27,510 --> 03:32:36,389
in the paper of a card. I see that and I have of course set up a way to reset once more. Go on.

936
03:32:36,389 --> 03:32:48,420
A player friend here. They already hold the key. What are they? What are they turning into? Like a

937
03:32:48,420 --> 03:33:02,840
tv. Okay ants. Just gotta be careful. The number of ants is a problem. Let's go this way. What does

938
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:17,540
this do? Just this is 2-2. This will kill this if I I'm gonna put it here. Here we are. Yeah this

939
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:44,790
would have killed it. So I mean I gotta get hurt but oh god. Maybe that was a bad idea. Oh yeah yay.

940
03:33:44,790 --> 03:33:58,010
I gotta hook something. I think I have to otherwise I'm just gonna lose right now. What should I pull?

941
03:33:58,010 --> 03:34:13,180
One of the ants? No. Skink probably. Why did everybody want me to do the ringworm? Doesn't work

942
03:34:13,180 --> 03:34:31,670
like this. It only pulls the front one. Oh I'll take one of the ants because now this will live

943
03:34:31,670 --> 03:34:42,280
forever technically. So wait can I I can sacrifice that now like this right? This is correct right?

944
03:34:42,280 --> 03:35:02,979
Tell me I'm tell me I'm a good boy. Tell me I'm a good boy. Okay I found the stunted wolf. I've seen

945
03:35:02,979 --> 03:35:12,120
this play out enough times to know that plan is in motion. Make haste. You're oh you're a bug right?

946
03:35:12,120 --> 03:35:26,180
This will clear all this. I think I just win. Pretty sure this is just a win right now. I think

947
03:35:26,180 --> 03:36:02,940
so. Is it right? One more. You're such a good boy. This was cool. I'll do this one again. Oh you've

948
03:36:02,940 --> 03:36:11,819
been such a good boy this year. Everything has a sigil right? So three drawn cards must be.

949
03:36:11,819 --> 03:36:21,159
Every card I have is a sigil. Your scare cam is blocking the text. What's a good place to put the

950
03:36:21,159 --> 03:36:52,139
camera then? What? Oh I passed. This is always three blood and it okay that beehive. This is never

951
03:36:52,139 --> 03:37:08,500
going to attack right? This doesn't attack. It has no attack right? These all stink. I would pick this

952
03:37:08,500 --> 03:37:22,600
one. Four bones. This one's not bad but bad roll. So if this attacks will it actually because this

953
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:25,239
these things don't attack because it's not gonna hurt anything. Does it actually just have to

954
03:37:25,239 --> 03:37:31,610
physically move or does it actually actually have to hurt something? You could sacrifice this one.

955
03:37:31,610 --> 03:38:01,909
I'll take it for the bugs. Oh you can't use that. What the hell is this? What? This bottle of goo

956
03:38:01,909 --> 03:38:41,129
has no use. All right angler time let's go. Huge man approached. Go fish. You guys use it? I'm

957
03:38:41,129 --> 03:38:46,180
serious you cannot use that. There's no possible use for it. I'll place it on that shelf over there

958
03:38:46,180 --> 03:40:13,610
for now. I need my advice avoided. Oh oh oh it's oh shit I'm an idiot. No oh it's fucking nice drop.

959
03:40:13,610 --> 03:40:36,229
I can't play this game. I would have done whatever. Fuck. Shit. If I had gone this way it would have

960
03:40:36,229 --> 03:41:14,360
I would have had four teeth land. Ah whatever. All right it'll do the damage fine. One two three four.

961
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:30,440
I can't really do anything. I can put a squirrel here. I think I just have to go right? Oh I can

962
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:36,469
sacrifice that. I didn't think I could. I thought I had to get killed. Okay I didn't know I could

963
03:41:36,469 --> 03:41:40,870
sacrifice it. I didn't think it was an actual. I thought sacrifice. This is so loud I need to turn

964
03:41:40,870 --> 03:41:47,209
this down so I can hear myself think. Um I thought I didn't think this was like a thing to sacrifice.

965
03:41:47,209 --> 03:42:10,500
Okay so I'm gonna put the adder over here and that'll kill that. All right I'm back in business.

966
03:42:10,500 --> 03:42:23,690
Take this stupid squirrel. Come on. Thank god. He's I'm not I'm not panicking. I'm not panicking. I'm

967
03:42:23,690 --> 03:42:50,540
all right. I'll turn it up for you. I just don't want to hear it. I'm kind of in trouble here.

968
03:42:50,540 --> 03:43:38,069
I should go put him here. Oh where I? What the hell is in here? Okay this is frozen away. Will

969
03:43:38,069 --> 03:43:52,659
this help me here? Okay so if I put that in front of one of these guys here that'll block and then

970
03:43:53,219 --> 03:44:15,129
come back to life? Could I sacrifice this now? Would that be stupid? All right well

971
03:44:18,549 --> 03:44:33,659
I don't know. I have to pull a tooth. Save your head on stream? I don't think so. See what happens.

972
03:44:34,219 --> 03:44:57,299
Okay now let's scroll down. Sacrifice squirrel and the frozen thing and then I can use this and

973
03:44:57,299 --> 03:45:21,260
that'll kill it. That's right. Wolf then fan. Okay so now I go squirrel mantis and then bang

974
03:45:21,260 --> 03:45:31,719
I win. Does it matter where I put this guy? Right here and then that's free. Do I need to use the fan?

975
03:45:31,719 --> 03:45:48,819
I think it'll just work right? Do I have to use the fan? Fan. Yo let's go! See I just need like to look

976
03:45:48,819 --> 03:46:02,520
over it have you guys play the game for me because I can't fucking do this. We're good.

977
03:46:11,959 --> 03:46:27,270
Oh we got a we got a Gek. I always take the Gek always every time. This game is really fun. I think

978
03:46:27,270 --> 03:46:33,860
it's a good game. My brain just okay what here's the thing when I'm streaming my brain is going in

979
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:40,120
two different directions. This is the type of game that I would like be on the toilet and just be

980
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:50,100
like and each turn I get to sit there for like fucking 15 minutes. If I sit here for 15 minutes

981
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:56,549
and just go like this then like people are going to be like what's wrong with his brain? Is he

982
03:46:56,549 --> 03:47:04,329
all right? What is he? Hello is he alive? What's he doing? Why is it taking him so long? I would

983
03:47:04,329 --> 03:47:15,159
sit there like this and I would like get up and eat a sandwich probably halfway through one of

984
03:47:15,159 --> 03:47:26,920
these. I think it's great. I love this but when I'm streaming like it's my brain is like operating

985
03:47:26,920 --> 03:47:38,489
in two different places. All right we're back in the snow. Let me at least beat this part. Oh move

986
03:47:38,489 --> 03:47:54,680
the camera right. Sorry we do a sweat check. No it's like yellow under there. No it's not. Shut up.

987
03:47:54,680 --> 03:48:04,420
It's not. I'm kidding. It's a joke. I actually am sweating. I'm fucking kidding. It's not. Look see

988
03:48:04,420 --> 03:48:16,709
see it's a joke. It's the light. I have a yellow light burning down on me. It's not. I have a

989
03:48:16,709 --> 03:48:46,389
yellow light right here. Look you see. Look at it's yellow right there. Yeah this is this is this is

990
03:48:46,389 --> 03:49:09,899
like this. Is this on iPad? No. Oh this thing is ridiculous so I'm taking this. It's coming to

991
03:49:09,899 --> 03:49:36,379
switch soon. Oh that's awesome. All right health. I mean nine health. Oh I gotta let. Hold on. I

992
03:49:36,379 --> 03:49:43,299
gotta talk about what's going on tomorrow. Tomorrow we are going. Just because there's a lot of people

993
03:49:43,299 --> 03:49:52,889
here. Tomorrow we are going to be playing Elden Ring PVP. Tomorrow is very important. I'm not

994
03:49:52,889 --> 03:50:03,719
ending this. The stream's not over yet. Elden Ring PVP with the intention of finding my champions

995
03:50:03,719 --> 03:50:14,040
because Ludwig and I are doing a 1v1 community versus community trial by combat night. He's

996
03:50:14,040 --> 03:50:17,719
look he's got his own shit. He's got his own shit going. He's got his own community to worry about

997
03:50:17,719 --> 03:50:29,530
right. He's gonna find the community kind of champions there. I'm picking mine tomorrow and

998
03:50:29,530 --> 03:50:38,540
we use rivers of blood. Now that's a good question. We're probably gonna we're probably going to I

999
03:50:38,540 --> 03:50:46,040
would assume maybe we'll ban a few items. We'll find out. We have to have some rules. We're not

1000
03:50:46,040 --> 03:50:51,459
sure what those rules are yet. What's the rune level? We'll figure that out in the next day or

1001
03:50:51,459 --> 03:50:58,139
so. Let's have a ban list. But tomorrow we're gonna mess around again. That was so much fun

1002
03:50:58,139 --> 03:51:01,899
just doing PVP invasion night. I want to do it again. I had a lot of fun doing it. It was awesome.

1003
03:51:03,500 --> 03:51:08,600
But the biggest intention tomorrow is to find who I want as my champions.

1004
03:51:08,600 --> 03:51:14,549
We're later on probably this coming week. This weekend. I'm really tired and want to go to bed.

1005
03:51:14,549 --> 03:51:19,510
I'm not going to go that long tonight. And if you want to know am I going to play this again?

1006
03:51:21,459 --> 03:51:29,739
Yeah. Yeah. Am I am I capable of playing this again? You think so? I really like it but I have

1007
03:51:29,739 --> 03:51:36,149
trouble. I have a lot of trouble. Maybe you guys can help me. Maybe you guys can help me play it.

1008
03:51:38,940 --> 03:51:47,399
All right. What do I want plus two health? I love the concept of this game. I love it.

1009
03:51:47,399 --> 03:51:58,120
Am I just my brain is cross-eyed when I play a game like this. It's really as good as a good game.

1010
03:51:58,120 --> 03:52:02,760
No. I mean it is. This is awesome. I love the art. I love the lore. I love the atmosphere.

1011
03:52:02,760 --> 03:52:10,729
If you guys can help me. I don't care about that. Right. Whatever. All right. I was thinking moose

1012
03:52:10,729 --> 03:52:22,379
buck or or geck. I'm sorry. I'm so scatterbrained. I just you know what I just my brain has so much

1013
03:52:22,379 --> 03:52:31,459
trouble sitting here and like doing this. So if you came here looking for a you know like oh I

1014
03:52:31,459 --> 03:52:36,100
I won't come on like why the fuck can't you do this? I apologize. I'm sorry. I hope it's like

1015
03:52:36,100 --> 03:52:43,989
fun. I'm having fun. I hope you're having fun. My brain is just can't like focus. It's stupid.

1016
03:52:43,989 --> 03:53:06,549
Okay. We're good. Okay. So what's the what's the stipulation here? Thorns. Okay. Cool. Yeah.

1017
03:53:06,549 --> 03:53:23,299
Ooh. Right off the bat. Over on the right. What do you think? I know exactly how you feel. You're

1018
03:53:23,299 --> 03:53:29,350
doing better than I did. Yeah. I know. I know sometimes I'm concerned about being an absolute

1019
03:53:29,350 --> 03:53:33,510
like idiot in the game and people just sit here calling like dude what the fuck are you doing man?

1020
03:53:34,229 --> 03:53:55,750
I'm gonna say all the way to the right and then a squirrel and then we go is your first try.

1021
03:53:56,389 --> 03:54:00,090
Yeah. I know. I'm just having fun. I'm just having fun. I just really don't want people to

1022
03:54:00,969 --> 03:54:09,750
think um oh do I really care about being like an idiot? I don't know. I literally like ate bubble

1023
03:54:09,829 --> 03:54:17,340
soap two days ago. I'm concerned about looking stupid in a video game. Oh really? Uh what? All

1024
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:35,020
right. Here we go. I'm bringing out the uh I'm bringing out the moose. No. Bring out the wolf.

1025
03:54:35,020 --> 03:54:51,610
Shit. I don't know. Should I put them? Oh that hurts a lot. Thankfully it moved over there

1026
03:54:51,610 --> 03:55:15,979
though. Okay. Fuck that hurt. I need the moose. Do I live? If I don't I think I live one more time.

1027
03:55:17,299 --> 03:55:22,940
I don't know what to do. Grab another squirrel next turn. Oh actually I'm not this is okay.

1028
03:55:23,579 --> 03:55:58,280
Okay this is all right. This is not bad. So now I can sacrafo- oh I think I'm dead. Game over Andy.

1029
03:55:58,280 --> 03:56:07,260
Okay well whatever. Let's just uh just kill me. I lose anyways. Do I live one more turn? No.

1030
03:56:08,059 --> 03:56:27,799
Yeah I just lose. I want to at least see the other boss right? Do I even have any

1031
03:56:27,799 --> 03:56:41,020
health? Oh I know. Okay. That's it. I don't want anymore. I look around the room. No I have I have

1032
03:56:41,020 --> 03:56:54,870
I've done um a lot of stuff I could do so far right? Yeah let's just I did the clock. I did

1033
03:56:54,870 --> 03:57:00,620
the little minigames here. I did the sword, the dagger right? Took that and I did all that. Yeah

1034
03:57:02,020 --> 03:57:11,610
oh wait a minute this is the goo right? Keep sealed. Pain is unbearable even after all these

1035
03:57:11,610 --> 03:57:20,229
years. What do you want? I have very little to live for these days. You have the master's eye.

1036
03:57:20,229 --> 03:57:30,459
Does this mean the master can see me? Magnificus. Can you see me? Can you free me? It is done.

1037
03:57:30,459 --> 03:57:39,799
Master is free. Well the end must be close now. If Magnificus is free it must be close.

1038
03:57:39,799 --> 03:57:46,920
Watching the angler lose now that soothed my pain. An old rival of mine that fisherman. He

1039
03:57:46,920 --> 03:57:52,600
bested me this time but I will have another chance. Oh I see you have a little something

1040
03:57:52,600 --> 03:57:58,120
special up your sleeve. Fear not I won't blow your cover. You just need to get a hold of that

1041
03:57:58,120 --> 03:58:07,500
camera of his. Maybe if you defeated him you would get a chance. So I have to like beat the game and

1042
03:58:07,500 --> 03:58:31,100
then take a picture of him. Interesting. Very interesting. I want more buffs. Plus two health.

1043
03:58:31,100 --> 03:59:16,120
Echo again. One five or adder. I'm gonna do adder. I feel like that's very useful. All right I did it.

1044
03:59:16,120 --> 03:59:43,209
I bite my lip and I don't want people to see. Bad habit. All right squirrel, mantis. Seems like a

1045
03:59:43,209 --> 04:00:29,899
good idea. And then bullfrog. Is that a stupid idea? All right okay I got it. Bingo. Porcupine

1046
04:00:29,899 --> 04:00:52,940
going in. Um which will give me the bones to put Reginald to kill this. Then this can go here.

1047
04:00:54,340 --> 04:01:09,819
Then you will kill that. Then I will take one tooth worth of damage. Now I kind of need a squirrel

1048
04:01:09,819 --> 04:01:29,670
and then hit the pass button. All right okay. Okay now. Oh that's too bad. Do I keep Reginald there

1049
04:01:29,670 --> 04:01:49,110
and just pass? I think so. I think I'm all right. Okay all right now that kills that. Let me take a

1050
04:01:49,110 --> 04:01:56,229
look at the board. This kills this. This is gonna just hit that. There'll be another one of these

1051
04:01:56,229 --> 04:02:07,879
coming down. Oh okay. This is gonna swing. This is gonna come down and hit and then go over here.

1052
04:02:07,879 --> 04:02:22,659
So I'll put the adder here. Eventually this kills that. This stays here. This is gonna move down.

1053
04:02:22,659 --> 04:02:34,090
I put the adder here but I can't really do that yet so I'm gonna pass again. Confirm. Confirm.

1054
04:02:34,649 --> 04:03:15,500
Confirm with me. Confirm. Adder kills rock. And now I got two squirrels. Adder. Bang. Bang. Good.

1055
04:03:15,500 --> 04:03:25,379
Another squirrel. We're good. Very nice. Because that was gonna bounce over here.

1056
04:03:25,379 --> 04:03:47,370
Okay grab another squirrel. So Wolf will kill that. Hold on a second. I want to place this right now

1057
04:03:47,370 --> 04:03:59,979
and then we go boink boink. Because then that'll move down here right? That didn't do what I

1058
04:03:59,979 --> 04:04:25,079
thought it was gonna do. I think I win. That is it. Game over. Game over. I win. See? I am smart.

1059
04:04:25,079 --> 04:04:41,979
See? There's something in there. It's not empty. It's watch. Apparently it's made out of metal.

1060
04:04:41,979 --> 04:05:11,209
Hold on. Can I make it like sound hollow? I'm smart. Me smart. All right show me some pelts.

1061
04:05:11,209 --> 04:05:28,940
Okay. Raven egg. That's new. Goat seems good. Just beaver. Sounds kind of good too.

1062
04:05:28,940 --> 04:05:54,340
Gross. Raven egg. Okay this is important. Mantis god. I don't even care about the others. I want

1063
04:05:54,340 --> 04:06:16,569
that one. Okay. I want to put the mantis god up there and I want to give the mantis god something

1064
04:06:16,569 --> 04:06:38,920
crazy. Oh my god. Adder. Boom. Yeah. Adder for sure. I did the wrong way? No I didn't. Is this

1065
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:44,010
not backwards? Is it backwards? No it's not. This is the thing that you're sacrificing. The thing up

1066
04:06:44,010 --> 04:06:51,639
top. I'm good. Yeah it's not backwards. You just made me freak out. All right we're doing Adder.

1067
04:06:51,639 --> 04:07:07,879
This is gonna be amazing. There's only one health glob. Wow. That's really cool. Okay let's see.

1068
04:07:07,879 --> 04:07:36,680
I hope I get it. These are gonna turn into something crazy. I mean I'm gonna put that out

1069
04:07:36,680 --> 04:07:56,790
here. Okay. Um I can't do anything really. I could. Oh wait. Hold on. Wait. Wait. This comes back.

1070
04:07:56,790 --> 04:08:17,260
So I sacrifice. Put the wolf here. So it'll kill that and do up there. Okay. Nice. Yo what the

1071
04:08:17,260 --> 04:08:32,629
fuck? Wait. Wait. What the fuck happened? What? I died instantly. Oh my god. What happened? Crap.

1072
04:08:32,629 --> 04:08:38,790
Oh that's so sad. I thought I was fine. The fly. Yeah the fly. But I thought I didn't think I was

1073
04:08:38,790 --> 04:08:59,780
gonna die in one turn. Shit. Okay one cost. They're all one. Doesn't matter. Power and health.

1074
04:08:59,780 --> 04:09:33,049
Gonna be this. Sigils. I mean yeah mantis god. God. Hey chapstick boy. How are your lips? Thanks

1075
04:09:33,049 --> 04:09:51,530
for the reminder. Yeah we're not gonna start at six o'clock. What are you looking at? Keep your eyes

1076
04:09:51,530 --> 04:09:59,899
on me. That foul stunted wolf. You really want such a creature in your deck? The sight of it does try

1077
04:09:59,899 --> 04:10:17,270
my temper. But it has been dealt. So it stands. Don't forget to. Don't. Don't do that. What's this?

1078
04:10:17,829 --> 04:10:27,049
Different kind of choice. Choose not a specific beast. Decide the cost that you wish to pay.

1079
04:10:32,389 --> 04:10:49,479
All right probably one. Lewis. A weird card. Stealth and moves around. I feel like that's kind of

1080
04:10:49,479 --> 04:11:02,760
pain in the ass. You're kidding me. I've been typing chapstick chaps in chat for months and

1081
04:11:02,760 --> 04:11:28,940
nobody else does it. Oh when when this is the worst card ever. I think it's gonna be you.

1082
04:11:28,940 --> 04:11:31,899
Chapstick. I keep running into these. I gotta take a look at the map before I do this.

1083
04:11:32,139 --> 04:12:05,659
Okay um. Defeat him first. Two four. Holy shit. I'm gonna put you over here. No I just woke up from

1084
04:12:05,659 --> 04:12:22,059
that. I'm sorry. He's still in act one? Dude. I don't. I know. But whatever. I'm having a good

1085
04:12:22,059 --> 04:12:34,040
time. Who cares? Somebody said it was gonna take him 10 hours to get out of act one. He hates this

1086
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:39,860
game? No I do not. Who said that? I think this is fun. I did not say it. I think this is really

1087
04:12:39,860 --> 04:12:52,809
genuinely cool. Okay so um. That'll kill that. I've got this defense here. So we're just gonna go

1088
04:12:53,530 --> 04:13:19,159
whack and then we're gonna go whack. We know when you hate something is when you growl at us.

1089
04:13:19,159 --> 04:13:45,239
I don't have enough money. All right so I did that for a little while. Thinking about going back to

1090
04:13:45,239 --> 04:13:58,250
squirrel. Like all squirrels have flight? Oops that was not good. That's not what I wanted.

1091
04:13:58,250 --> 04:14:25,180
Squirrels can't even attack man. Oh great. Good idea. It's all right. We're good. We're good. It's

1092
04:14:25,180 --> 04:15:12,229
gonna be fine. Why did that not work? And we have to use Lois. Ow. Oh what a perfect draw. I want to

1093
04:15:12,229 --> 04:15:31,620
do this again so bad. All right you suck. I'm putting you here instead. You have me here. I

1094
04:15:31,620 --> 04:15:54,790
surrender. Why would you do that? I'm losing. No. All right nice. I'll get you this next round.

1095
04:15:58,629 --> 04:16:11,979
I'm really good in act one. If you want a really good puzzle game just try The Witness.

1096
04:16:11,979 --> 04:16:25,290
I don't really like those kind of puzzles. I'm more into the puzzles that go like and they open

1097
04:16:25,290 --> 04:16:37,479
and stuff. That's my favorite. If a puzzle game has like a draw that opens like puzzle noises.

1098
04:16:37,479 --> 04:16:44,250
Yeah like escape rooms. You know okay. Does anybody here want a multi-billion dollar idea?

1099
04:16:44,250 --> 04:16:52,340
I'll give it to you. I have a multi-trillion dollar idea. Good luck whoever wants to do it because

1100
04:16:52,340 --> 04:16:58,729
like I'm not gonna do it but I'll give it to you. I just want five percent of every sale. So I made

1101
04:16:58,729 --> 04:17:05,000
it up. So I will tell you right now I want five percent of all your sales. Have an escape room.

1102
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:13,879
That's not an escape room. It is just a huge box that has all the like kind of box puzzle game

1103
04:17:13,879 --> 04:17:20,489
shit. Like you know the box inside of the box that has like the key. You have to twist like the bottom

1104
04:17:20,489 --> 04:17:25,370
that pulls out the little thing that has to go into the slot that's on top. Which then the whole

1105
04:17:25,370 --> 04:17:32,090
thing opens up and there's a big thing in here that you have to figure out. A huge puzzle box.

1106
04:17:32,090 --> 04:17:41,370
That's not a toy store. It's yeah the room. The room but real. Actually make it. And the thing

1107
04:17:41,370 --> 04:17:52,200
takes like three hours to complete. So the thing starts as like a cube. Right? A huge cube that's

1108
04:17:52,200 --> 04:17:57,979
a big wooden box and there's a padlock on the left of it underneath. And it's like okay what's that?

1109
04:17:57,979 --> 04:18:01,180
Well there's a little device over here that you have to look at that'll give you those three

1110
04:18:01,180 --> 04:18:05,819
numbers. When you do the three numbers in the padlock that thing opens. Like a little tray comes

1111
04:18:05,819 --> 04:18:10,219
out and there's a key in there. You take the key out. There's a keyhole that's on top of the box.

1112
04:18:10,219 --> 04:18:16,520
You stick it in. Open the top of the box. Inside of that comes up pops up another big puzzle.

1113
04:18:19,590 --> 04:18:25,510
Every time I played a game like The Room I go my god I wish I could I would I would pay an

1114
04:18:25,510 --> 04:18:33,379
exorbitant amount of money to do this in real life. An escape room that's not an escape room.

1115
04:18:33,379 --> 04:18:40,819
An escape room that's condensed inside of a gigantic like three hour puzzle box. And this

1116
04:18:40,819 --> 04:18:47,850
thing could be four three four five feet tall and like five feet wide. That's what an escape room is.

1117
04:18:47,850 --> 04:18:51,370
No escape room is like all spread out. I'm talking condensed in like go play The Room and you know

1118
04:18:51,370 --> 04:18:54,569
what I'm talking about. There's a billion dollar idea. Five percent of every sale thank you.

1119
04:18:54,569 --> 04:19:03,659
Oh by the way if you don't if I don't get five percent of sale. Oh god lawyers.

1120
04:19:05,979 --> 04:19:19,420
You'd be in trouble. I'm gonna take Reginald. Your pack was full so give me something cool.

1121
04:19:19,420 --> 04:19:33,930
This is worth just going here with full um full items. Why not? Wouldn't The Room just get five

1122
04:19:33,930 --> 04:19:46,340
percent? Imagine you made like a puzzle box thing and I heard about it. And I mean that's not like

1123
04:19:46,420 --> 04:19:50,889
that that's like that's an idea that probably everybody's probably thought of. And I'm like

1124
04:19:50,889 --> 04:19:59,850
demanding five percent. I said on my stream that a big puzzle box was a good idea. Yeah you know

1125
04:19:59,850 --> 04:20:08,069
what's had this great idea? Jeffrey the giraffe from Toys R Us. He has a whole store full of them.

1126
04:20:08,069 --> 04:20:36,360
You guys know who Jeffrey the giraffe is? I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid.

1127
04:20:36,360 --> 04:20:41,239
I always want to be a Toys R Us kid. Now that those commercials would have been really funny

1128
04:20:41,239 --> 04:20:50,409
if they got like a 50 year old guy to do it right. Because like I don't want to grow up.

1129
04:20:50,409 --> 04:20:57,559
I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. And the guy's like 50 like dancing around the

1130
04:20:57,559 --> 04:21:12,409
store brainwashing. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. That would be like kind of

1131
04:21:12,409 --> 04:21:19,450
fucked up. I don't yeah that wouldn't be all right. That guy no but they said that it was like I don't

1132
04:21:19,450 --> 04:21:42,469
ever want I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid forever. I don't want to grow up. I'm part

1133
04:21:42,469 --> 04:22:01,530
of the Drew crew. Yeah and he's like he's like kind of like in his 50s you know he's like acid

1134
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:09,860
reflux. I don't want to grow up. I'll always be a Toys R Us kid. That's how the commercial ends.

1135
04:22:09,860 --> 04:22:28,229
His like stomach goes up a little. He's got like a hot dog in one of his hands. All right Reginald I

1136
04:22:28,229 --> 04:22:42,229
want you to kill. What's wrong with this guy? I just fucking lost the game again didn't I? No I

1137
04:22:42,229 --> 04:22:54,340
didn't. Back right. Do I have three items? All right let me see the items. I don't look over this

1138
04:22:54,340 --> 04:23:00,790
way. Whatever dude I want to open up the squirrel thing. That's two. I need to go bang bang. I

1139
04:23:00,790 --> 04:23:20,979
actually don't need to use it yet but I might. Whatever I'm an idiot. Your puke noises are so

1140
04:23:20,979 --> 04:23:25,690
gross. This is a terrible play. I should have just opened up the fucking thing. What happens if I

1141
04:23:25,690 --> 04:23:44,860
I pull this back. Cancel this so I can break this. I don't I I mean I thought I could pull it back

1142
04:23:44,860 --> 04:23:52,600
for a second. I always want to be a Toys R Us. Okay I'm done. I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow.

1143
04:23:52,680 --> 04:24:12,200
I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm out of here. You know that I have a video of me with no shirt

1144
04:24:12,200 --> 04:24:22,120
on that I recorded like 10 of these on my phone and it's me board facing the camera like board

1145
04:24:22,120 --> 04:24:29,180
facing this way with no shirt on. It looks like I have a huge fat stomach and it's me saying that

1146
04:24:29,180 --> 04:24:40,149
I was gonna try out to be the next Armin for Attack on Titan and at the end I go like Aaron

1147
04:24:41,110 --> 04:24:48,500
Aaron run away and then I go and when I do that I fart in real life and just Holly just starts

1148
04:24:48,500 --> 04:25:00,010
laughing her ass off. Um the video is fucking crazy. It's like I went like too much. I went like too

1149
04:25:00,010 --> 04:25:12,260
hard and you just hear Holly start laughing. Will you ever show that? Maybe. Maybe one day.

1150
04:25:12,260 --> 04:25:27,799
Maybe one day. Maybe one day you'll see. Ooh one day maybe you'll see it. Randomly one day maybe

1151
04:25:27,799 --> 04:25:39,989
I'll just be like you know who cares. I don't even give a shit who gives a fuck. You can't say that

1152
04:25:39,989 --> 04:25:45,659
and not show it. Yeah well just maybe one day I'll fucking put it up. Make it a main channel vid.

1153
04:25:45,659 --> 04:26:00,459
At least do the audio. You know I could I could do the audio and I would also probably yeah okay

1154
04:26:00,459 --> 04:26:08,649
maybe. I've recorded here's the thing I recorded maybe 10 of them so there's like 10 versions of

1155
04:26:08,649 --> 04:26:15,770
this. I really think a lot of people think I'm making this up when I say that I will just sit

1156
04:26:15,770 --> 04:26:23,270
there and just do something like that over and over again and just I don't know I said maybe

1157
04:26:23,270 --> 04:26:33,559
something wrong with me. I don't know. I fell asleep two days ago to a like seven or eight

1158
04:26:33,559 --> 04:26:38,819
hour Kathy Mitchell playlist of various like infomercials and her showing cooking food and

1159
04:26:38,819 --> 04:26:48,489
stuff. It's like it's like better than television to me. The like eight hour Kathy Mitchell playlist

1160
04:26:48,489 --> 04:26:58,579
is more entertaining to me than like Mad Men. I don't I don't know why. I don't know I don't

1161
04:26:58,579 --> 04:27:17,719
understand why. Imagine picking Bird with like that would be stupid. You just say things. I mean

1162
04:27:18,360 --> 04:27:29,909
I I I don't know and no I didn't guys. I gotta be clear. I don't I didn't fart 10 times in a row.

1163
04:27:29,909 --> 04:27:44,440
I just on like the seventh or eighth one. It was like this did I want to leak this so bad.

1164
04:27:44,440 --> 04:27:50,520
It's an idea and I want to leak it but I kind of I can't because if I ever actually get to do it

1165
04:27:50,520 --> 04:27:58,729
because what if it doesn't happen then maybe maybe you'll never know. Not this. I'm talking

1166
04:27:58,729 --> 04:28:14,090
about something else. No I'm not going to leak it. I'm not going to leak this thing I'm talking

1167
04:28:14,090 --> 04:28:17,129
about because if it actually happens it's going to be my favorite stream I've ever done in my

1168
04:28:17,129 --> 04:28:22,459
whole life. Nothing will ever compare. Ever. If I can get it to work. I don't know if I can.

1169
04:28:22,459 --> 04:28:25,690
I don't want to build excitement for it but it'll be it'll be the best thing.

1170
04:28:25,690 --> 04:28:32,629
Nothing will ever compare. It'll be better than dollhouse. At least from me it will.

1171
04:28:32,629 --> 04:28:42,219
From me it will. Okay wait wait wait. I actually think I'm just going to use this here.

1172
04:28:42,219 --> 04:29:06,680
Egomaniac thinks about himself only. Not always. Maybe leak in two years. Okay so let's go. I need

1173
04:29:06,680 --> 04:29:25,690
something to kill that. Five two. Exactly what I wanted. Okay this will kill that now. Dude what

1174
04:29:25,690 --> 04:30:05,959
the hell's going on? How am I? Break this fucking thing please. This is okay. Elk with flight.

1175
04:30:05,959 --> 04:30:20,739
Throw us the fart video. I will. I will show it to you. One of these days. I'll show it to you.

1176
04:30:22,600 --> 04:31:30,979
I will. One two. I mean this whatever. Ow. This thing's stupid. What does this do?

1177
04:31:33,059 --> 04:31:47,620
I don't want this boulder. Sucks. Two four. I'm going to replace you here I think. Yeah then

1178
04:31:47,620 --> 04:32:03,620
I'll save the rest for now. Go ahead and knock this all out. Out of the face. I think I'm

1179
04:32:03,620 --> 04:32:22,059
still fine. I have a bunch of squirrels already. There we are. Okay just kill this stuff. All right

1180
04:32:22,780 --> 04:32:37,370
I need. Ackrat will kill this and then I can do cockroach. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

1181
04:32:37,370 --> 04:33:06,490
Two. Mile please. Ah it hurts to do that. Um cockroaches what is it just dies

1182
04:33:06,490 --> 04:33:12,409
whenever you play it or something. So I gotta just put this out. I could do squirrel. I'm kind

1183
04:33:12,409 --> 04:33:30,090
of in trouble. What does this do again? Ackrat or should I do this? Ackrat. I just have to not die.

1184
04:33:32,259 --> 04:34:12,380
Fake fuck Andy? What? What are you talking about? What is this? Oh bones. Fake fuck Andy. Thank you.

1185
04:34:19,580 --> 04:35:07,659
Boss time man. It is. Get out there. Thank you. I almost lost. When will the fart leak? I don't

1186
04:35:07,659 --> 04:35:23,930
know. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe like. I don't know. Maybe somebody's birthday. Always. I like

1187
04:35:23,930 --> 04:35:39,830
this game a lot. What is this? Did I do this one yet? Whose birthday? That's for me to decide.

1188
04:35:39,830 --> 04:35:51,830
I was the pelt one. Okay. Orbs maggots? The creature that you own perishes by combat. A

1189
04:35:51,830 --> 04:36:08,250
carb bearing is automatically played in its place. Another wolf would be good. Or uh mantis. I feel

1190
04:36:08,250 --> 04:36:19,060
like I don't have a lot of damage. Leak it if you lose your trial by combat community knight.

1191
04:36:19,060 --> 04:36:23,380
The Ludwig. No because the people that get picked will just throw so they get to see like the

1192
04:36:23,380 --> 04:36:38,389
leaked fart video. I'm gonna do the wolf. I need damage. I need like more than. Everything I have

1193
04:36:38,389 --> 04:36:52,099
is like one. Leak it if you win. Maybe I'll leak a screenshot of I win maybe. I'm not gonna. I'm.

1194
04:36:52,099 --> 04:36:58,580
It's a video. Yeah. I told you. I'm lying in a bed. Aiming it up like this. Like the camera's

1195
04:36:58,580 --> 04:37:04,040
facing this way and I make it so I'm like filling the whole frame. I look huge. I don't know why

1196
04:37:04,040 --> 04:37:25,049
I was doing it. It's fucking horrible. All right we're going uh. I don't want to do the kick.

1197
04:37:25,049 --> 04:37:48,409
Atrioc. Big A. Welcome everybody. I'm playing uh inscription. Thanks for the raid. Hope you had a

1198
04:37:48,409 --> 04:37:53,900
good stream Atrioc. I'm doing really well in this card game. I've gotten past the second boss. I've

1199
04:37:53,900 --> 04:37:59,590
gotten to the third area. Almost at the end of the game. I'm doing very well. No one said anything

1200
04:37:59,590 --> 04:38:16,229
uh about how poorly I'm playing the game. Another raid? There's not two raids in a row right?

1201
04:38:16,229 --> 04:38:29,340
No. Okay well that's. There's a lot of. There's like two three raids today. Thank you. Appreciate

1202
04:38:29,340 --> 04:38:35,000
it. Well let's go. We're playing inscription. I can't say I'm gonna be live for that much longer.

1203
04:38:35,000 --> 04:38:42,810
Maybe like when I get to the end of this run. All right let's go. You don't know how to play

1204
04:38:42,810 --> 04:38:48,169
inscription. Um neither do I. So I can't really explain it to you because I'm not the person to

1205
04:38:48,169 --> 04:39:05,580
ask. All right uh I'm doing gecko over here on the right. And let's go. What should I do now?

1206
04:39:05,580 --> 04:39:17,459
All right I got squirrel. This is gonna be perfect. Squirrel squirrel. Bang bang. Hold on a minute

1207
04:39:17,459 --> 04:39:39,750
though. I'm not gonna kill that. Might be Dumbo. I don't know whatever. I'm just going for the win

1208
04:39:39,750 --> 04:40:14,759
as fast as I can. Remember is there a penalty? For what? Dr. Oldker raid? No way. That's crazy.

1209
04:40:14,759 --> 04:40:22,779
Dr. Oldker's been dead since like 1850. That's really crazy. I can't believe he's raiding.

1210
04:40:22,779 --> 04:40:47,240
He's here right now? Holy crap. Uh I don't want to kill. Give me another pack wrap. Pack wrap. Pack

1211
04:40:47,240 --> 04:41:07,959
wrap. Pack wrap. Pack wrap. Did you hear about Joel's shit talking? Dr. Dr. Oldker's pizza?

1212
04:41:07,959 --> 04:41:18,299
No right? That's gotta be it. That's gotta be fake right? No no no. He would never. What do you

1213
04:41:18,299 --> 04:42:01,639
know? No way. That's fake news. Hold on give me one second. Just typing. It's in mod chat.

1214
04:42:08,229 --> 04:42:19,669
All right squirrel uh putting the gecko out obviously. Obviously. Will this kill me if I

1215
04:42:19,669 --> 04:42:30,779
put it here? All right if I put this here it's gonna be the next turn I'm done right? If I put

1216
04:42:30,779 --> 04:42:39,369
the the gecko there it will die next turn right? Oh they said they all have flying. Okay all right

1217
04:42:39,369 --> 04:43:21,020
well then I'm putting it here. Let's go by the way. Yes. No Lois is bad. Raids. Raids. Raids. Yeah a

1218
04:43:21,020 --> 04:43:36,139
lot of raids. Did I just lose? What the fuck is that? I actually just lost. What just happened? I

1219
04:43:36,139 --> 04:43:48,779
just threw. I'm not in my element. I'm not sitting on a toilet or lying on my back in bed at four

1220
04:43:48,779 --> 04:43:56,090
o'clock in the morning. I'm not in my element right now with a game like this. I am gonna take this

1221
04:43:56,090 --> 04:44:12,900
because I feel like everything's dying so quickly I need something to take hits. Power. All right

1222
04:44:12,900 --> 04:44:24,700
what do I want? All right pack rat. I love using the pack rat so I'm gonna or the yeah gecko too.

1223
04:44:24,700 --> 04:44:36,490
Yeah always. Always. He has to. No I'm just saying I'm usually I'm in my element more when I'm

1224
04:44:36,490 --> 04:44:49,529
lying on my back like this. Okay taunted wolf is actually really good. Okay so now I'm gonna go

1225
04:44:49,529 --> 04:45:05,529
this way. Let's go. These are gross sex jokes? What are you talking about? When do they make a sex

1226
04:45:05,529 --> 04:45:38,779
joke? What do you mean? When did I do that? I didn't do that. These are gross sex jokes. Dude no. All

1227
04:45:38,779 --> 04:45:49,319
right I do this IRL. I do that all the time. I don't have to do it now. What do I have for items?

1228
04:45:49,319 --> 04:46:12,900
Okay I'm gonna use the cat bone thing over here. Your adversary will entirely skip their next turn.

1229
04:46:12,900 --> 04:46:46,419
Yeah fuck you. B is free right? Yep. Now can I at least kill the the fisherman again? Why are you

1230
04:46:46,419 --> 04:46:51,860
so dirty today? I'm not dirty ever. I just look dirty because this thing is the sun is shining on

1231
04:46:51,860 --> 04:47:08,180
my face. It's right there and it's just glistening off all the face oil that I have. Do the same. I

1232
04:47:08,180 --> 04:47:23,209
do. All right it's 11 a.m here. Yeah we're not gonna go much longer. This is my last run and then again

1233
04:47:23,209 --> 04:47:30,180
tomorrow don't forget write it down if you have to. Tomorrow is Elden Ring PvP community tryout

1234
04:47:30,180 --> 04:47:36,180
night to see who has what it takes to take on Ludwig's community in the community champion night

1235
04:47:36,180 --> 04:47:40,740
when I decide who's gonna be my community champion or the stream where we fight each other.

1236
04:47:42,580 --> 04:47:52,759
Sorry. All right I'm not fucking this one up. This is it. I keep messing this one up and I'm

1237
04:47:52,759 --> 04:48:26,229
an idiot for doing it. Yes it does. I'm gonna save this. Okay let's go. It's fine.

1238
04:48:29,799 --> 04:48:51,930
Then okay don't screw this up. I already did didn't I? No I didn't because now I play this pelt.

1239
04:48:51,930 --> 04:49:09,240
Take pelt and then good. Close the pelt. All right and then I play stink bug here right off the bat.

1240
04:49:09,240 --> 04:49:20,490
All right good nice top deck. It actually uh for real you're right. There we go. We go here. All

1241
04:49:20,490 --> 04:49:51,959
right let's do it. That's round one right? One more. Yeah that's it. That's it. Round two. Go fish.

1242
04:49:51,959 --> 04:50:00,119
This is the part that sucks. Huge. Very very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good.

1243
04:50:00,119 --> 04:50:30,740
Actual awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Do it. Oh stabbed my arm. Oh fuck. I'm in. Did I have

1244
04:50:30,740 --> 04:50:36,619
the knife? I forgot. Do I even have the knife? It was oh my god. I forgot it even existed.

1245
04:50:42,490 --> 04:51:06,139
I forgot it. It was like blending in and hiding back here. Give me this fucking thing. No fuck.

1246
04:51:10,180 --> 04:51:34,279
What do I do? Um I have to do it and then I can put this section might be okay. So if I do that's

1247
04:51:34,279 --> 04:51:42,569
four five six seven. I think that's a win right there. Yeah that's a win. I got it. Thank god.

1248
04:51:43,130 --> 04:52:11,299
I almost just blew it. My god man. I seriously almost blew it. I just whatever. Long elk amoeba

1249
04:52:11,299 --> 04:52:28,740
or two. What is long elk? Weird. I like this one. Three three two. Safe. Please replace the eye.

1250
04:52:35,560 --> 04:52:48,659
This one. Take the glowy one. Does it matter? I thought that was just like a funny little thing.

1251
04:52:48,659 --> 04:53:03,580
Did that matter? The eyes matter. I didn't know that. All right can I get to the at least past

1252
04:53:03,580 --> 04:53:15,750
the third boss or add to the third boss? Didn't I pick it before? I thought I already clicked it.

1253
04:53:15,750 --> 04:53:55,580
Whoa expensive though. It just can die. It's just kind of like tanky. Well let's go get the item.

1254
04:53:55,580 --> 04:54:09,380
Another knife. Knife is really helpful. I mean this was awesome too. I'm picking up. And I guess

1255
04:54:09,380 --> 04:54:27,430
I'm a fan. Pretty good items. Not bad. Okay you have flight. I just hit this. Echo always goes out

1256
04:54:27,430 --> 04:54:36,740
always no matter what. This is zero four so that's fine. Keep you here. And I got stunted wolf too.

1257
04:54:36,740 --> 04:54:50,220
Stunted wolf will. Maybe I just have stunted wolf kill this. Just be hitting this. Of course I have

1258
04:54:50,220 --> 04:55:08,860
him over here. Eventually it'll kill that. Yeah. Oh it's gonna fly over you. Okay cool.

1259
04:55:09,099 --> 04:55:53,799
I'm just gonna pass. Um I think I just lost. Did I just lose? Did I? If I take the knife and then

1260
04:55:53,799 --> 04:56:11,529
pack rat before kill. No I have to sacrifice this. Don't use items. I have lives. Yeah. Could I have

1261
04:56:11,529 --> 04:56:22,180
played that better? I feel like I did everything correct. Wolf will kill the bird. Yeah I'm just

1262
04:56:22,180 --> 04:56:43,340
gonna pass again. Then I guess I should. Am I okay? I think I'm okay. Am I dead? Not yet. This is.

1263
04:56:43,340 --> 04:56:51,000
All right yeah I'm fine. I'm kind of scared there. I need to use something. I'm gonna try to use the

1264
04:56:51,000 --> 04:56:59,240
knife. This pack rat's gonna come out and it's gonna be wasted. Use the fan instead of the knife.

1265
04:56:59,240 --> 04:57:39,619
Okay and this pack rat in here. That will kill that. That will. I think that yeah that's it. He

1266
04:57:39,619 --> 04:57:48,279
wasted the fan. I can't. I just want to replace it. I don't like these. They're too hard. I'm going

1267
04:57:48,279 --> 04:58:17,369
this way. I'll take a two. What's this do again? This deletes one and gives me um. What's this do?

1268
04:58:17,369 --> 04:58:39,639
I'm deleting Lois. This card's awful. This card's awful. I'm getting there a little bit longer.

1269
04:58:39,639 --> 04:59:00,540
See if I can at least get to the boss. I'll be happy. I mean put the geck over here. That's all

1270
04:59:00,540 --> 04:59:23,029
I can really do right now. Is your face cam too small? All right that's gonna be. All right so

1271
04:59:23,029 --> 04:59:47,619
I'm gonna rip a tooth out and then pack rat and then kill this fucking thing. Oy! Oh that's it.

1272
04:59:47,619 --> 05:00:18,759
Oh my goodness. I'm so. I was trying to be so confidently correct but I don't know. Whatever.

1273
05:00:23,909 --> 05:00:44,299
ADHD brain. Yeah dude check this out. Okay this is gonna be like a 6-6. This thing is gonna be

1274
05:00:44,299 --> 05:00:59,659
insane. Get me up there. All right don't quit absolutely squirt. Just quit squirring around.

1275
05:00:59,659 --> 05:01:07,819
I've got it. It's a 6-6. I gotta take this shit out now. I don't care about the fawn. I got the

1276
05:01:07,819 --> 05:01:18,099
rabbit. So we're gonna go squirrel. The rabbit does. Whenever this is played I get a rabbit in

1277
05:01:18,099 --> 05:01:52,939
my hand. So we're gonna. Oh eat shit. I win. I'm not gonna use this yet. I just beat him one turn.

1278
05:01:52,939 --> 05:02:16,150
Raven. Okay let's make pack rat even better. If I get pack rat flight I could win games in one

1279
05:02:16,150 --> 05:02:37,849
turn. That's what I'm doing. But I have to get rid of the raven. I just got it. I'll go for it.

1280
05:02:37,849 --> 05:02:51,369
This is a 6-6 flying pack rat. See if it helps. I feel like it's gonna be all right. I'm at the

1281
05:02:51,369 --> 05:03:04,500
boss. The man stood before you. A man you recognize immediately. It was the trapper. He reached out

1282
05:03:04,500 --> 05:03:22,360
to examine his wares but he stopped you. All right but today you will supply the pelts. So this okay

1283
05:03:22,360 --> 05:03:27,369
it's just crap. When a card bearing the sigil perishes the creature opposing it perishes as

1284
05:03:27,369 --> 05:03:35,619
well. You don't want to kill that. Like you want some shitty thing to kill that. All right there it

1285
05:03:35,619 --> 05:03:56,220
is. There it is. So I want to use the rabbit and then I'll get. I got another raid. Criken coming in

1286
05:03:56,220 --> 05:04:08,580
with a raid. I got this with so many raids. What's going on? Thanks Criken. Welcome everybody.

1287
05:04:08,580 --> 05:04:18,119
Playing um inscription and I'm about to beat the guy in one turn because now I can do this.

1288
05:04:18,119 --> 05:04:37,959
I'm gonna kill him in one turn. Okay now what? I'm gonna beat him in one second.

1289
05:04:37,959 --> 05:04:49,990
Cycle must continue. Let's trade. Powerful cards. I will accept only the finest pelts for them.

1290
05:04:50,069 --> 05:04:58,790
Okay. Great for what you can but know this. The rest will stay and fight for me. That's fine. I'm

1291
05:04:58,790 --> 05:05:12,459
just gonna fly over you and kill you in one hit. So I have to pick a card. Please read. Take the

1292
05:05:12,459 --> 05:05:30,020
wolf. Take his big health cards. Like the grizzly. I still win. No I still win. Take the bloodhound.

1293
05:05:30,020 --> 05:05:45,540
Oh that blocks me. You're right. Okay who else do I want? And the grizzly. Or the raven. Yep raven.

1294
05:05:45,540 --> 05:05:58,970
Raven. Okay I kill him in one hit. I'm done. Yeah I win. Goodbye. Just end turn. It's over.

1295
05:05:59,049 --> 05:06:20,700
Come on. I didn't do anything. Need a light? GG. And you know I'm taking another pack rat. You

1296
05:06:20,700 --> 05:06:31,930
understand? I'm gonna upgrade it again. You can see a light in the distance. The end is near.

1297
05:06:31,930 --> 05:07:04,459
Let me see. Please pay attention. All right. What do I want to do here? What's better? Probably the

1298
05:07:04,459 --> 05:07:17,819
merge one. Wait is this the merge one? No it's not. It's pelts. I'm so nervous. All right. Who's going

1299
05:07:17,819 --> 05:07:52,700
in here? Who should I put in there? Pack rat? Buff the rat. Maybe one of these? Or the stinky one?

1300
05:07:52,700 --> 05:07:56,139
Oh no no no no no. Yep that's an amazing thing I'm gonna do right now.

1301
05:07:56,779 --> 05:08:08,380
Gecko. Holy shit this is huge. Absolutely unbelievably unequivocally, equivocally huge.

1302
05:08:08,380 --> 05:08:14,729
So this I'm at the I'm at the I can fight this thing? I'm at the boss? Your eyes have fixed

1303
05:08:14,729 --> 05:08:19,930
themselves in the small cabin. It's warm light a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the night.

1304
05:08:19,930 --> 05:08:45,049
Surely surely this cabin marked the end of your travels. You guys gonna have to help me. Just get

1305
05:08:45,049 --> 05:08:55,930
the fuck out of me. I like knew something might have happened too. You're presented with an

1306
05:08:55,930 --> 05:09:02,060
opportunity. I don't offer my boons to just any traveler. If you're able to pass my trials you

1307
05:09:02,060 --> 05:09:10,709
will be rewarded mightily. Trial of the swift. Redrawn cards must include a card with the

1308
05:09:11,349 --> 05:09:32,790
sprinter, waterborne, or they must be rare. Yeah I don't think I have. It's definitely this one.

1309
05:09:32,790 --> 05:09:44,659
One two three. Ah pack rat is a rare card. Success. I will grant you one of my most powerful boons.

1310
05:09:44,659 --> 05:09:48,889
Cards that dramatically alter the game and you don't even need to draw them.

1311
05:09:50,810 --> 05:09:57,700
Boon of the bone lord. You will start a battle with eight bones. Boon of the ambidextrous. You

1312
05:09:57,700 --> 05:10:03,509
may draw twice at the beginning of your turn. Boon of the forest. You will start a battle with grand

1313
05:10:04,500 --> 05:10:16,069
urs on all your spaces. I feel like draw twice is just like that's a I don't know if anything

1314
05:10:17,689 --> 05:10:21,049
these are the tanky things that stay in front and this is a shitload of bones. I'm taking this one

1315
05:10:22,069 --> 05:10:30,939
and draw twice. We will repeat that once more. The trial of skins. The three drawn cards must

1316
05:10:30,939 --> 05:10:41,049
include a pelt card. No. Airborne. I have a few of those. If you have a ring you pass automatically.

1317
05:10:41,049 --> 05:10:51,880
Look at the table. 11 o'clock. What does that mean? 11. I don't think do I I don't have a ring.

1318
05:10:51,880 --> 05:11:20,709
I'm gonna it has to be airborne. What's he doing? You managed to get a boon. This may be a fair

1319
05:11:20,709 --> 05:11:44,419
competition. He's gonna scream at me. I'm ready. What the fuck? You took your time out there.

1320
05:11:44,419 --> 05:12:02,869
And I'm itching for another game. Are you ready to play? I hope you are all adequately prepared.

1321
05:12:02,869 --> 05:12:33,939
Perhaps one more to be safe. That's not fair. Shit. What do you got? Okay mole man. Okay I can do

1322
05:12:38,919 --> 05:13:03,299
whorl smoke right here right? Put stow down on the right because then it'll be one no. I don't want

1323
05:13:03,299 --> 05:13:12,229
to screw this up because that will hit. That should be correct. I think that's correct. And then should

1324
05:13:12,229 --> 05:13:18,380
I put the smoke pelt out just to get the bones and get it hit? I wonder where the bones should go.

1325
05:13:18,380 --> 05:13:39,080
All the way to the next door? Plug the lane with the pelt. Save it. Okay all right let's go. Okay

1326
05:13:39,080 --> 05:13:45,000
I'm like nervous. I'm gonna I feel like I'm gonna look like an idiot. Okay I have a rat king which

1327
05:13:45,000 --> 05:13:50,069
gives me bones. I have a lot of bone things but I don't know what this is gonna hit three times.

1328
05:13:50,069 --> 05:14:00,340
So we have to go like this. Draw. I can draw twice. Two squirrels and then go straight up here.

1329
05:14:00,340 --> 05:14:15,500
I have items too. Yeah nice. All right I don't want to get hit three times here. So I'm gonna go

1330
05:14:16,939 --> 05:14:27,049
squirrel, stunted wolf right down uh main street here. Wolf pelt here, smoke here. Got it? Oh my god

1331
05:14:27,049 --> 05:14:32,180
I have this thing. All right this is going all the way to the left. This is going all the way to the

1332
05:14:32,180 --> 05:14:49,380
left. It's gonna tank this damage. That's what I'm doing. And then the smoke is gonna go here um right.

1333
05:14:49,380 --> 05:15:08,680
Okay so let's do this and then pelt here. Let's go. Yeah let's go. What the fuck is he doing?

1334
05:15:08,680 --> 05:15:12,119
What is happening right now? Why is he doing this? I didn't what's he doing this? What the

1335
05:15:12,119 --> 05:15:18,889
fuck is going on? He didn't take another zero. What the hell just happened? Did he do that before

1336
05:15:18,889 --> 05:15:27,060
every turn? Oh my god it's over. Oh he's putting on the different masks.

1337
05:15:31,259 --> 05:15:48,740
That's not good. It's really bad. It's not over. Okay I think I just have to pass right? Or should

1338
05:15:48,740 --> 05:16:00,259
I put the squirrel down to not? I have to pass I think. Should I use the knife right now?

1339
05:16:00,259 --> 05:16:39,139
Or just block him with the smoke? God. Oh okay I have to frog. I have to knife. Knife hourglass.

1340
05:16:39,139 --> 05:17:08,709
Should I put the amalgam? Knife hourglass? Knife hourglass amalgam. Card cut. Oh I thought it was

1341
05:17:08,709 --> 05:17:15,959
a stab. Okay so I obviously want to kill the amalgam right? Or should I kill? This is going

1342
05:17:15,959 --> 05:17:31,659
to be three damage regardless right? Like this? Let him hook the squirrel. I know my health is

1343
05:17:31,659 --> 05:17:42,020
just I'm dead. What should I get rid of? This one here? The amalgam put bullcrab onto mantis god.

1344
05:17:42,840 --> 05:18:03,619
Yeah that's the play. I have another squirrel too. Dead man. Bullfrog. Oh but wait! Hourglass

hourglass hourglass. Alright I can do it. I can hourglass. Now you can't do shit? Now?

1346
05:18:11,099 --> 05:18:19,430
