1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Hitman Absolution!

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,079
This game came out literally last night, and I am giddy as a horse on a track.

3
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,079
I don't even know what the context of that actually means, but I cannot wait to play this game.

4
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,079
I've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here.

5
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
So, what do you say we start this? Let's play, baby.

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,079
Doing it right from scratch. I've never played one second of this game, so this is completely blind, and let's go.

7
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:57,259
Listen to me. I need you to be...

8
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:03,380
Alright, so, I think I have completed the tutorial so far.

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,379
The lady was just like talking in my ear, so I was like, you know what? We're like gonna just skip right through this.

10
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,379
So, what I've learned so far is how to essentially play the game, and that's good!

11
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,379
So, I'm gonna try... Oh, he's talking.

12
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,549
Accessing mansion. Approaching target.

13
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,370
Alright. So, ask climb down.

14
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,250
I'm doing some... What'd you... I thought I fell.

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,680
Oh, boy.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Move on. I gotta see if anyone's in here.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,620
Nope. Move past window. Go!

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,620
Move past window again. Go!

19
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,799
This is some James Bond crap here.

20
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,099
Jump up there, baby.

21
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,099
But, yes, I have to kill my old contractor.

22
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,730
So, let's see. Oh, boy.

23
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,730
This place is heavily guarded.

24
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,980
Uh, can I, like, shoot this guy in his face?

25
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Oh, nope. I'm good. I'm good.

26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,180
Yeah, get out of my... I'm trying to sneak around here.

27
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:25,250
Yeah, get out of my face. Get out of the window, man.

28
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,490
Why did I do that?

29
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,560
That means I gotta kill this guy now.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Damn it. Alright, we did it.

31
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,569
Yeah, I'll change it.

32
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,569
I gotta put my weapon away.

33
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,569
I gotta drag this guy out of the way.

34
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,449
Come here. I'm gonna hide you behind here.

35
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,009
That was kind of unnecessary, but, you know, whatever.

36
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,009
Can I throw him out the window?

37
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,009
Oh, I think I can dump this guy out the freaking window.

38
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:12,599
Oh, man. See you later, buddy.

39
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,599
Oh, no. Oh, I gotta do it to this guy, too.

40
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Wait, any guards?

41
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,219
Oh, yeah, holding down control lets you do something called instinct,

42
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,219
which lets you blend in and see kind of through walls.

43
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,219
So, let's dump this guy now, too.

44
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,219
Hey, your friends out there, you wanna go see them?

45
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,639
No, I don't wanna do this. No, please.

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,900
Alright, let's be careful here. No, I don't see anybody.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,419
Here's the exit right here. Open.

48
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:47,090
Okay, can I open the fridge?

49
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,580
Disable security system. Where is it?

50
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Okay, security system's over there.

51
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Gotta disable it so I can kill my target,

52
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Diana Stevenson, whatever her name is.

53
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,509
Evidence.

54
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,509
Perfect. Yeah, my meter on the bottom right,

55
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,509
if you don't know what it is,

56
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:14,509
instinct, that depletes the more I hold down control.

57
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,459
So, wait, what is this, disguise? Is this a new disguise?

58
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,889
Can I put this on? Oh, I already have that one on.

59
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,889
If you don't know what hitman disguising is,

60
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,889
when you kill people or you knock them out,

61
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,889
you can take their clothing and blend in with places that you belong.

62
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,129
So, it's very, very interesting.

63
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,129
Beyond this door, the rating system will be turned on.

64
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,129
It will monitor your play style and reward your progress.

65
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,129
Ooh, okay.

66
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,129
You can see it in the top left corner.

67
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,129
As always, how you handle your assignment is entirely up to you.

68
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,620
Mmm, good luck. Alright, here we go.

69
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,569
Get key card from head of security.

70
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,939
Look at all those guys.

71
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,009
Whoa, that guy's right there.

72
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,720
That guy's path is up there.

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Alright, what is this pot?

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Do I, like, have to...

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't know, I'm scared.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Let's go, man. Get out of this room. I want to poison you.

77
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Ooh.

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Oh, God, he's coming over here.

79
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,790
Alright, I'm killing this guy.

80
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,790
Get out of here!

81
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,740
Alright, alright.

82
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
I was only asking. Christ.

83
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Don't have a heart attack.

84
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,870
I say, go guard a gate or shoot at some beer can.

85
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,870
The heat should dissolve any hint of foreign substance.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,870
So, wait, I gotta poison this stuff?

87
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Oh, his knife just disappeared. Oh, boy.

88
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,870
Oh, boy, playing ring around the rosie with the chef.

89
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,870
Oh, boy. Ring around the rosie. Oh, boy.

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,110
Oh, no.

91
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,110
I killed the chef.

92
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,110
Get over here. Get over here. Come here.

93
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,930
Come here, you fat bastard.

94
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,930
I'm gonna put you in the freezer.

95
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,220
Oh, I'm gonna take his clothes.

96
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I'm gonna be like Chef 47. Here we go.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Is it gonna look so stupid?

98
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
Oh, nice.

99
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Oh.

100
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,220
Alright, let's see.

101
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
What about my world famous fish dish?

102
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,579
I'm good.

103
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,579
Except for the big pool of blood over here.

104
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,579
I think I'm doing alright right now.

105
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,579
Anything else I can grab over here?

106
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,399
No, I don't have any visible guns.

107
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,399
Let's go through here.

108
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,399
Looking for the head of security is over there.

109
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,399
There he is.

110
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,470
Gotta get his key card.

111
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm disguised as the chef.

112
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,610
Wait.

113
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,610
Choice coffee.

114
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,610
Do I gotta poison the coffee?

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,610
Fire poker.

116
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,610
Oh, I wanna pick up this fire poker.

117
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,610
Oh, what's upstairs?

118
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,610
Let's go upstairs.

119
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,360
Let's go upstairs.

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I gotta find poison or something.

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Trespassing? What?

122
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Oh, damn.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Oh, hi. Hello there, sir.

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Yes, I know. I'm going back downstairs.

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Don't worry. I'm just gonna

126
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
go downstairs for a second here.

127
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,009
Don't worry about the MasterChef.

128
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,819
Oh, don't you worry about a thing.

129
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,819
Shh. Quiet. Quiet.

130
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,819
Yes. Yes.

131
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,060
Now come with me.

132
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,689
I'll take this disguise from you.

133
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,439
And then I'm gonna dump your ass

134
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,790
into here.

135
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,670
Okay. I need to find a solution.

136
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,670
I could just go guns blazing, but I don't

137
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,670
wanna really do that. I do that way too often

138
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,669
in games. Sleeping pills.

139
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,490
Ooh. Ooh, sleeping pills.

140
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,299
Bang. You know it.

141
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,299
Activate checkpoint. Hell yeah.

142
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,299
Can I take a dump?

143
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,299
No. Alright, so I got these

144
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,299
sleeping pills. I'm gonna put the sleeping pills in the drink.

145
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,299
The guy's gonna fall asleep, and I'm gonna take his money,

146
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,299
his wallet, and the keycard.

147
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,299
Statue bust.

148
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,299
Take the statue.

149
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:02,210
I don't wanna use this right now.

150
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,210
In fact, I gotta let go of this.

151
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,210
Let's head back downstairs.

152
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,210
This door requires a keycard.

153
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,210
What? Oh, no.

154
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,210
Did that guy have one on him?

155
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,210
Oh, damn it.

156
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,210
That asshole down over here has

157
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,019
a keycard, I think.

158
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,019
Hey, where did I dump your body?

159
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,019
Oh, in here. Excuse me, sir, do you have a card?

160
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,019
No, I don't wanna get in with this guy.

161
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,259
This is weird.

162
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,259
No, I don't wanna do that.

163
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,259
Oh, crap.

164
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,259
How am I gonna get to? Oh, no, no, no.

165
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,259
I can go downstairs. I actually came from down here.

166
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,259
What am I doing here?

167
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,259
I gotta let go of this stupid statue.

168
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,539
Alright, good.

169
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,710
I wanna holster that.

170
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,710
Good, good, good, good, good.

171
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,710
Alright, where's your coffee?

172
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,710
Oh, jeez, I'm bumping into stuff.

173
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,360
Hey, how's your coffee, sir?

174
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Let me just, uh, can I talk to you

175
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
about, um, maybe a raise?

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,539
Maybe some type of situation

177
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,539
where you and I can discuss my money?

178
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,539
Maybe that would be a good thing.

179
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,539
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

180
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,029
Oh, turn around. Don't worry.

181
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't worry about a thing. Don't worry about a thing.

182
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Come drink your coffee. Hey.

183
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,789
Don't drink your damn coffee.

184
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,269
Get his uniform and weapon and send the son of a bitch packing.

185
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,269
What?

186
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,269
I will make sure he spends the rest of his career as a night watchman

187
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,269
at a midwestern corn silo.

188
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,269
I'm gonna just smash this guy, I think.

189
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,269
Let's see.

190
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,269
Is he gonna drink his coffee again? Please go back to your coffee.

191
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,879
There he goes.

192
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,879
That's right. Go drink the coffee.

193
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,879
Coffee is good.

194
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,950
Oh, you don't even know?

195
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,950
I'm just like, no, nothing. Just, uh, itching my nose here.

196
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't worry about anything.

197
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
How's that coffee?

198
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,759
I bet you it's good.

199
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Where are you going?

200
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Stay sharp, men.

201
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
I have urgent business with gate security.

202
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,889
Is he gonna go, like, diarrhea? I hope so.

203
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,889
Yeah.

204
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,889
I'm gonna make sure he gets out okay, fellas.

205
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,889
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna follow him over here.

206
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,580
Oh, wait.

207
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Just did.

208
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
How are you guys doing?

209
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,750
Hello there, men. How are you?

210
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
I'm a fellow recruit. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay.

211
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,269
Oh, boy. That guy is...

212
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,269
That guy's not liking this at all.

213
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,789
Oh, I'm out of instinct. I can't, like, fool him.

214
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:44,220
Let me just read a book.

215
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,960
Oh, nice. It worked.

216
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,759
All right. Give me your stuff.

217
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,000
Give me the key card. Give me your pistol.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
All right.

219
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,529
All right. Good, good, good. I got the key card.

220
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,700
All right. We're doing good here.

221
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,450
Why did I do that?

222
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,450
That was completely unnecessary.

223
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,009
I just, like, lost points because of that.

224
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,009
God damn it. Why am I such a freak?

225
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,759
I could've, like...

226
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,759
Oh, well. Let's just go.

227
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,429
Why do I have to kill that guy?

228
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,429
What the... Oh!

229
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,740
Now you tell me that.

230
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Oh, by the way, if you do really well and don't kill everybody,

231
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
you get more moves.

232
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,230
Thanks for letting me know.

233
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,230
I could've used that advice, like, 30 seconds ago

234
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,230
before I shot that guy in his face.

235
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,779
Entrance located.

236
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,990
All right. Now what?

237
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,690
Closing in on target.

238
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,460
Done 47. Diana brought this on herself.

239
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Oh, she's right there.

240
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,460
She betrayed us, the agency, the code,

241
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
everything we stand for.

242
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,460
She is too dangerous to be left alive.

243
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
Think about that.

244
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,769
When you pull the trigger.

245
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,769
So, do I gotta... Oh, I'm gonna see some

246
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,769
inner conflict here, guys. Do I kill her

247
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,330
or do I not kill her?

248
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,529
She's right through this door. Should I just open the door?

249
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,960
I guess so.

250
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Oh, boy!

251
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,350
Censored!

252
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,350
This is where we censor

253
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,509
a bunch of stuff.

254
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:37,389
Hello, Diana. Glad to see you're

255
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,759
taking a shower.

256
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:47,120
Fully closed, by the way.

257
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
Oh, and he does it.

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:00,860
Killed her.

259
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,419
Wait a minute. Get to Victoria.

260
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,879
What is going on here?

261
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,879
Oh, does it?

262
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,139
That's good to know.

263
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,139
Why do I... My guns are just out.

264
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,139
Dude, sun's out, guns out, huh?

265
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,409
Okay, let's go.

266
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:21,409
I think I'm gonna have to go in like a blaze

267
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,409
of glory here, guys.

268
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,409
I don't think they want me to be stealthy here.

269
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,409
Can he?

270
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,419
Really?

271
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,450
Hold control for instinct.

272
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,070
Press Q to activate point shooting.

273
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,070
Wait, what?

274
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,070
Place a tag?

275
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,070
Oh, dear

276
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,070
goodness.

277
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,070
Oh!

278
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,070
This is some Fallout 3

279
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,070
garbage right here.

280
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,500
Dude, that was...

281
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
That was sick!

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,509
I should have just done that to the whole

283
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,139
room down here.

284
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,139
Oh, wow, that was cool.

285
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,629
That was really cool.

286
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,629
I just killed four dudes in one shot.

287
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,149
That was really cool. I just killed four dudes in one second.

288
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,840
Hell freaking yeah.

289
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,360
Oh, so this is like

290
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
the daughter or something? I have no idea.

291
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,139
Don't worry, you can come with me.

292
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,309
I will protect you. I'm 47.

293
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,309
Good to meet you.

294
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,740
Sonny in here.

295
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,309
His mouth just moved and he didn't talk.

296
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:45,539
What was that?

297
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,759
She's dead.

298
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
Gonna bring you to somewhere safe.

299
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,519
Bitch.

300
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,759
Alright.

301
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
Reduce recoil when firing weapons.

302
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,419
Not too bad.

303
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,659
I mean, I got spotted once.

304
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:09,340
I killed a civilian apparently.

305
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
I killed three dudes.

306
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Well, it made me kill three guys, didn't it?

307
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,029
Complete objective. Body hidden.

308
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,210
Evidence removed. Silent kill.

309
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,830
Head shot. I did okay.

310
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,830
I mean, not fantastic, but

311
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,710
for a blind run.

312
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,080
Cool, cool, cool. Alright, well

313
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I guess that concludes episode one

314
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,379
of this quasi

315
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,379
playthrough of Hitman Absolution.

316
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,379
Stay tuned for episode two when

317
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,379
me and this weird girl go

318
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:40,379
solve crimes together. I don't even know.

319
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,379
But I'll see you guys all soon. Stay tuned for next episode

320
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,379
and take care, everybody.
