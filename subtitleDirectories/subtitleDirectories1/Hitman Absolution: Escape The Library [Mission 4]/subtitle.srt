00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,199
Hey, what is going on everybody? Welcome back to Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,699
If you're just joining us, if you've never seen an episode before, then hello.

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:22,199
Welcome to an episode of Hitman Absolution. I suggest you go back and watch the first four or five episodes.

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,699
I think there's four right now. But let's get started here, escaping the library.

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,549
Gotta get rid of all these coppers, or at least avoid these coppers. Let's see here.

6
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:39,549
I actually do remember this from the gameplay demo they did a long time ago.

7
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:43,549
But I don't remember exactly how to do this, so we'll see how this goes.

8
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:48,329
Okay, what am I doing here?

9
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,829
Get out! Why are these guys still standing here?

10
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,149
Going like a coffee break. Get the hell out of here.

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,649
I'm gonna drop a chandelier on your head.

12
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,109
Now they're starting to move. Good, good, good.

13
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,609
Should be able just to chill out somewhere.

14
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,120
Right here seems good.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,430
Only one dude.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,950
Two guys over there, though.

17
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,620
Scaring me.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,859
Maybe I can just go now? Let's go now.

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,359
No, not now, not now. Wow.

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,980
Wow, I almost just got spotted right there.

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,500
How do I do? How am I supposed to just go?

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,879
Hey, go like on patrol somewhere. Get the hell out of here.

23
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,640
You prick, get away from me.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,980
Here we go, he's leaving.

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,120
Yeah, turn your back for two seconds and I'm out of here.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,079
Maybe not, he almost just saw me. What's that?

27
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,459
Check over there. I got it.

28
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,459
Uh, there's a point of interest over here.

29
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,340
Wow, don't move.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm gonna try and make my way over there.

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,459
I don't really feel like going over here.

32
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,460
Let's see, can I make it over here?

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,460
Without being spotted is the real question.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,219
Kind of.

35
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,219
But I don't like being in this position.

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,719
I don't like being in this position at all.

37
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,669
These guys have to move.

38
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,939
These guys have to move right now.

39
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:28,800
Right now.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Oh, these... I don't know where to go.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Don't stand up, that would be a bad idea.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,259
Let me just stand up real quick. Hi.

43
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,250
I wonder if I can still...

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,900
Now where's he going?

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,650
Go over there. Damn it.

46
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,080
Ah, maybe I can walk around this way?

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,580
Is there anybody over here? No, this is not okay.

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,930
Point shooting? I don't know how to do point shooting.

49
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,930
Ooh, release light rig.

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,409
Can I grab this without him seeing?

51
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,610
I don't know if I can. I'm gonna be spotted if I walk over here.

52
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,500
Do I have like a distraction thing? Like a bottle or something?

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,780
Maybe he won't see me.

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,620
Oh, he didn't see... Oh my god.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,939
Oh my god.

56
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,719
Oh my word.

57
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,719
Where are they going?

58
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,500
This one guy's coming over here right now.

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Does he have any idea what's...

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,240
Did I go behind him?

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,449
Holy crap.

62
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:39,430
Holy crap.

63
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,930
What's that guy just standing there for?

64
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,430
Get out of here, man. Don't just stand there.

65
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,120
Holy. Holy hell. Holy hell.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
This guy's coming over here right now.

67
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Holy hand grenade. Holy hell.

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,620
Don't see me.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,479
Do you know what, man?

70
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,939
No, that's not what I wanted to do.

71
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,099
This is ridiculous.

72
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,580
How on earth is a hiding place right here?

73
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:20,870
Can I subdue this guy without this one seeing?

74
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
This guy's gotta move.

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,939
Okay, here we go.

76
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:26,939
Moment of truth.

77
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,939
Moment of truth.

78
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,300
Moment of truth.

79
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,269
Moment of truth.

80
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,439
Where we go, boys?

81
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,439
And or girls?

82
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,889
Come here.

83
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:42,889
Come here, you.

84
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,089
Get back here.

85
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,089
Get back here.

86
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,160
Get back here.

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
And nobody is the wiser.

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,040
Give me your police disguise.

89
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,420
And then you're going in here.

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,600
It was a necessary thing I had to do.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,540
The lights are all on.

93
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,800
All right.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,639
I should probably pick up his gun.

95
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,639
What's Johnson's gun doing on the ground?

96
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,970
I don't know. I have no idea.

97
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,970
Something tells me I don't want to just walk by this guy.

98
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,970
That would be a terrible idea.

99
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,970
Let's go back the other way.

100
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,209
Actually, you know what?

101
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,209
Can I go up top?

102
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,740
Would be probably a better decision.

103
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,240
The lights are all just blaring right now.

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,620
Probably should.

105
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Holy crap.

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,750
That's another officer.

107
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,750
Why are you looking at the book?

108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,500
Why are you looking at the bookcases?

109
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
This guy's looking for me in the bookcases.

110
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
Like he's looking at the books.

111
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
I wonder, he might be inside of the books.

112
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
He never can be too careful.

113
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,420
This guy keeps on looking over here.

114
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
And you know what?

115
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,420
I am going to go back down.

116
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm going to go break those lights.

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:13,149
I remember seeing that one guy here.

118
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,939
I should be able to get behind him.

119
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,939
No, I don't even need to do that.

120
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,439
I can probably just, you know what?

121
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,879
I can probably just stand up and fake my way around.

122
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
Put the gun away though.

123
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,839
Yep.

124
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,339
Let's move back this way into the darkness.

125
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,629
I might even want to just get rid of this guy.

126
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,629
Seriously.

127
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,870
Oh crap.

128
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,769
Let's try this again.

129
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,269
This time let's be a little bit more sneaky about it, please.

130
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,810
And thank you.

131
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,810
Back is turned.

132
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,310
That guy's back is also turned.

133
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,310
Can I climb through here?

134
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,310
No, I can't.

135
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,579
I broke it.

136
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:07,709
There we go.

137
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,100
There we go.

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,410
There we go.

139
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,579
Oh boy.

140
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:17,689
This guy's coming back this way?

141
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,500
Damn it.

142
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Just hang out over there, dude.

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Just hang out over there.

144
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,740
Be cool.

145
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,939
We'll all be cool.

146
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,459
These guys have seen me now.

147
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,459
I might just be able to walk by.

148
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,459
Let's see if I can just...

149
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,089
No, I got to crouch back underneath here.

150
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,089
Wait for this guy to walk.

151
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,089
Is he walking out?

152
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,089
Go out.

153
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,649
Go out and talk to your friend.

154
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,319
That's what I'm talking about.

155
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,319
That's what I'm talking about.

156
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,379
Sabotage the lights.

157
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,379
Nobody see me.

158
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,620
Yes.

159
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
Yes.

160
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
That's what I'm talking about.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,819
No, don't look at me.

162
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:56,819
Don't look at me.

163
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm a cop too.

164
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,529
Don't look at me.

165
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,529
Good.

166
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:05,529
Good.

167
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,050
So far so good.

168
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,050
I'm going to go up the stairs now.

169
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,810
Both backs turned.

170
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,810
Yep.

171
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,259
Let's go up the stairs.

172
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,259
I'm a cop.

173
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,259
Don't worry.

174
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,259
I'm a police officer.

175
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,170
Just doing my job.

176
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,170
Looking up here.

177
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,370
Wow.

178
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,660
How is this other guy?

179
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Still looking back there.

180
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,110
Man, I can't go out there.

181
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,210
I can't go anywhere.

182
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,100
You bastards.

183
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I need to throw this guy off the balcony.

184
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,090
He's just annoying the hell out of me.

185
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,289
It looks like I could go over that way.

186
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:55,559
This guy's still...

187
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,559
Can I...

188
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,559
Maybe if I crouch I can...

189
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,929
Maybe he won't see me if I do this.

190
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,679
No, okay.

191
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,679
I can be sneaky about this.

192
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,649
See ya.

193
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,019
Wouldn't want to be ya.

194
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,539
Let's make our way.

195
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:12,539
Holy damn it.

196
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:19,700
You think you'd survive that drop?

197
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Don't worry about it.

198
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Just keep a lookout.

199
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I really don't think you would survive that drop.

200
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Just get away from the ledge.

201
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,779
Good slip and die.

202
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,590
Pull this out.

203
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,590
No one's going to die.

204
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,769
Just...

205
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,769
Just keep your eyes open.

206
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,769
You're good slip and die.

207
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,669
All right.

208
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:38,669
I definitely am supposed to go down this way and drop down.

209
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:45,440
Thanks for telling me what to do.

210
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,259
This guy turns his back.

211
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,259
Go look in that hole again.

212
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,259
Didn't it look like cool?

213
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,629
Wasn't it like weird looking?

214
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,629
Go like tell me how it looks.

215
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,730
Nope.

216
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,100
Not yet.

217
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Man, they don't really know how to play tricks on you in this game.

218
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
I would have just dropped down there and gotten instantly murdered.

219
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:17,000
There's no way I'm going to take out that guy unless he turns around and this guy's not looking.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know what?

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,730
Maybe I can push him in there.

222
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,730
He fell in the hole.

223
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,730
Nice.

224
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Good.

225
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Good.

226
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,480
Grand.

227
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Great.

228
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Grand.

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Wonderful.

230
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,820
Give me the hammer.

231
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't lose it here.

232
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Don't like freak out.

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,860
I am nervous as hell right now, man.

234
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
What's down?

235
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
Holy crap.

236
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
Get in here.

237
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,210
Get in.

238
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,159
Hide.

239
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,159
Hide.

240
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,830
Hide.

241
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,830
Hide.

242
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,350
Holy hell.

243
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,350
I don't even know if I should get out right now.

244
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,350
I really don't know if I should get out because if I get out, he might just turn around.

245
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,690
Ways like the strategy guide when you need it.

246
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,700
Looks like he's going down here.

247
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:30,669
This might be the best time to go and see where he stops.

248
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,669
Keep your back turned.

249
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,669
Going out now.

250
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,580
Yep.

251
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,330
There we go.

252
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,259
Okay.

253
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,259
Damn.

254
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,529
Ooh.

255
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,330
Ooh.

256
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,419
Okay.

257
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,179
Change cover.

258
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,769
Go.

259
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:02,769
Um.

260
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,350
No.

261
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,350
What are you doing?

262
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,350
I want to like get out of cover.

263
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,350
Not like do that.

264
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,860
There we go.

265
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,460
It's space.

266
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Through here.

267
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,559
Let's make it.

268
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,169
Can I climb through?

269
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,169
One guy.

270
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,169
There's the end.

271
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:33,169
Right there.

272
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm almost done.

273
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Yikes.

274
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,259
This is the only guy.

275
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,980
I'm going to go around this way.

276
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Is his back turned?

277
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
His back.

278
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,110
This guy's back is turned.

279
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,110
Oh damn it.

280
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,110
Oh damn it.

281
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,110
Oh damn it.

282
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,899
Oh damn it.

283
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:00,899
Oh damn it.

284
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:01,899
There he goes.

285
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:02,899
His route looks like it goes all the way down.

286
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,710
Perfect.

287
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:11,100
Let's get out of here.

288
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,659
Seriously get me out of here.

289
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,659
This guy's looking this way.

290
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,659
Get me out of here.

291
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,919
Oh damn it.

292
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,399
Oh I don't know.

293
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,399
I don't know.

294
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,399
I don't know.

295
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,399
I don't know.

296
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,399
He's coming all the way back here.

297
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,399
He's coming all the way back here.

298
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,700
Yeah you do know me from somewhere.

299
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,019
Oh I got to go up here.

300
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,429
Okay.

301
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:38,429
Oh my word.

302
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,399
This is it.

303
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,399
Where's this guy coming?

304
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,379
I don't know this guy's route.

305
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:45,480
I don't know this guy's route.

306
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,639
I don't know this guy's freaking route.

307
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,350
Oh no.

308
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,350
Stop right there.

309
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,850
Yes.

310
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:00,039
So lucky.

311
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:06,110
I can't believe I just did that.

312
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,590
I cannot believe I just did that.

313
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:21,620
How did this guy not just see me right there dude?

314
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,450
Oh it's impossible.

315
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,710
It is impossible that I just did not get spotted.

316
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:35,049
Release this.

317
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,039
What just happened?

318
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,039
I don't know.

319
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,039
I have no idea what just happened.

320
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,000
But I need to go out that door.

321
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:55,889
I make it across here.

322
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,889
Oh come on man.

323
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,950
Are you serious?

324
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:09,620
If I drop down here where can I go?

325
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,860
It's just a question of whether or not I can get past these two guys.

326
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,350
I wish I had that hammer still.

327
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,039
It would make things a lot easier.

328
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,200
Let's just walk by.

329
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,919
And out this way.

330
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,179
I might be able just to tactically move around up there.

331
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,570
You know what?

332
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,179
Let's do this.

333
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,179
Sayonara sucker.

334
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,659
Nope.

335
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,659
Bad idea.

336
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,799
Is it like a book I can pick up?

337
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,870
These guys follow the same route it seems.

338
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,110
Just a question of out maneuvering these two butt heads.

339
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,100
One guy's here.

340
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,899
One guy's there.

341
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,899
Let's go.

342
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:05,899
Let's go.

343
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:06,899
I'm just going for it.

344
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:15,179
I'm going for it baby.

345
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,179
Oh dear.

346
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,000
I made it.

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,309
I made it out the door.

348
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,149
Now what?

349
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,139
Looks like I can go up top.

350
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,139
Nobody up here.

351
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,960
I can start running.

352
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,460
Whoa.

353
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:45,610
This place is completely empty.

354
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,610
Nobody up here right?

355
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,179
I can like walk into someone.

356
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,179
So what do I do here?

357
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,179
I have to like.

358
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,840
What's this?

359
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,860
Release the chandelier.

360
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,539
Releasing this will likely cause fatalities.

361
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,429
Well don't I want like the silent assassin?

362
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:08,220
Oh I already like killed that guy.

363
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,380
What if I just like walk out the door?

364
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,700
What if I like to say no to killing these people?

365
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,259
Because they're just police officers.

366
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,259
They didn't do no harm.

367
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,160
Wait a minute.

368
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,700
Let's see if I can just go around this way.

369
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
I can't.

370
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,339
I have to drop that chandelier.

371
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,210
I don't want to like kill these people.

372
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,250
The game is making me kill these guys.

373
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,400
I don't want to.

374
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,599
Oh right.

375
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,849
I can just walk by it.

376
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,559
Right.

377
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,559
Bang baby.

378
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,569
Bang.

379
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:42,210
And that is going to wrap up the episode.

380
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,730
