00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:13,669
Hi there, welcome. Hope everybody's having a good post-Christmas, post-holiday here.

2
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:27,350
Relaxation day. Do have New Years coming up in just a few days, but I had a good Christmas.

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:41,829
I did some FaceTime with the family, which is always good. Yeah, I miss them, but it was fun.

4
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,640
The house here, I decided to give a few gifts to each other. Pretty wholesome day, and then

5
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:58,020
I just sat on the couch, watched TV and played video games, and ate snacks. It was pretty much

6
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:13,269
my whole day. So today into tonight, we are going to play this game called Kenshi. This is a game

7
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:23,450
about survival. It's like a wasteland kind of survival game that has top-down RTS, RPG,

8
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,290
hybrid, squad-based. There's a whole lot of crazy shit that can happen in this game,

9
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,310
so I figured I would give it a try. This game is going to be too hard for you.

10
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:45,099
That's fine. I did read a few things about it. This game is designed for you to just lose,

11
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:55,579
so by its very design choices, you're supposed to fucking lose. You can read? Yeah, I just

12
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:04,379
learned. I got this book, How to Read, and I started at the beginning, and now I finished

13
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:13,099
the book and I can read, but give me one second. We'll get started. I got the game ready to go. I

14
00:02:13,099 --> 00:03:07,500
just need to grab one thing. See you in two seconds. How did you read the book that taught

15
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,759
you how to read? I've read it. It was very easy at first. Starting off each page, it's about

16
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:22,379
a four to five hundred page book, and the first page is just big symbols of animals,

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,159
and you know, I know what that is. It shows you an elephant. I know that's what an elephant

18
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,719
is, and then you turn the next page and there's an E there. It's a giant E.

19
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:39,580
So, okay, I know what E is. I know what the letter E is, and the next page shows the elephant

20
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:49,159
again, and it puts E-L, and then by the time you get to chapter 10, you know in appliances

21
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,419
what they are and how to call them what they are. At the end of the book, the Great Gatsby

22
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:00,500
is in the book. They just put it at the end, so eventually you get there and you can read

23
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:10,169
the Great Gatsby. It's really cool. Let's get started. What do you say? Let's turn this

24
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:21,339
music on, turn this off, and here is Kenshi. So I don't really know much about this. All

25
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,699
I know is it's gonna be fucking hard, and it's gonna be a difficult video game,

26
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,709
but it should be fun as a character creator, and you know how much I love those things.

27
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:37,430
Let's go to the new game. All right, uh, choose your beginning. Wanderer, nobody's,

28
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,180
wanderer, the wandering trader, the holy sword, the cannibal hunter, the hive exile,

29
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:53,480
son of a captain, the slaves, rock bottom, empire citizen, holy nation citizen, guy with a dog.

30
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:04,660
Okay, I kind of like, I kind of like guy with a dog. Okay, difficulty is normal. I have, uh,

31
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,959
I have a source on Wikipedia for the amount of money that I have,

32
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,680
and the play style is RPG. A homeless and hungry drifter rescues an abandoned puppy.

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,439
It seems pretty useless. Maybe he will just eat it. Holy shit, that's the, I don't know if I want

34
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:28,920
to eat a dog. Okay, um, I don't think I want to eat a dog, but what else we got? RPG, RPG,

35
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,579
what are these other play styles? Action RPG, difficulty dodgy. I seriously regret coming into

36
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,139
cannibal territory. This is a stupid idea. Warning, you will be attacked immediately upon

37
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:48,149
game start. Not recommended for a first-time play. This is hard. I'm not ready for the

38
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:59,350
hard stuff. The wandering trader. No, I don't want to do a trading RPG. Nobody's easy,

39
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,589
easy and hard combination. Guy with a dog. I'm not going to do rock bottom. You've hit

40
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,470
absolute rock bottom. You are alone, unarmed, naked and hungry, lost in the middle of a harsh

41
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:17,029
desert, teeming with slavers, and you just lost an arm. Good luck. You want me to start

42
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:25,899
here after I've never played this game before. And you want me to start here.

43
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:30,300
We can only go up from here. All right, fine. Advanced options, hunger time. I'm not

44
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:42,899
going to mess with any of these. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Okay. This is called rock bottom.

45
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:55,160
Heavy inventory will slow you down, but it's a good way to hold the middle mouse to rotate

46
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,360
the guy. I have to make my character create your first character. Use the confirm button

47
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:11,589
when finished. Yeah, but I do. I'm all right. Idle stance. We can make him golem

48
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:30,149
the straight up standing. I kind of want number two. I like this one. I know everybody's going

49
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:39,019
to want me to do this one. I'm going to go with this one. This is fine. Height.

50
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:55,779
Just make it stretched out guy. I'm just going to take a squid. All right. So Frank

51
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:05,910
posture. I'm going to turn into a human bow and arrow. All right. I know that's too

52
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:19,420
extreme. Okay. I already love this game and I haven't even played it. All right.

53
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:29,160
But how do I shoulder set this so much here? What do you think? All the way back

54
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,659
or all the way? No, we'll just do this. I got a really bad nerd neck and all. I got

55
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,500
to change the leg length. Oh, we go. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

56
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,649
I like this one because this is just realistic enough. Shoulder set. I'm going to say

57
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:59,769
tight together. Uh, yeah. Down like this neck position. Let's see.

58
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:15,929
It's like a bird. How could you? You can't have a fully side. Can you make a,

59
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,169
if you're the developer of this game, can you pick a wrestling game?

60
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:26,360
You know what I mean? Like if you do have the necessary resources to make a wrestling game.

61
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:35,850
All right. Uh, leg length. Let's go with this one. He's going to be really tall.

62
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:55,779
Shoulders tight together. Arm bulk. Oh my Lord. Hands. You have big hands. No,

63
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,779
huge hands. It's too easy. Tiny hands. Does this affect how hard I punch?

64
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:17,379
Chest. No, we're just making a seahorse. Um, bring it down. Stomach.

65
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,909
How tall is this? How tall is he? I don't even know how tall, but this guy's like

66
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:49,179
nine feet tall. Just give him like a big diaper ass. All right. Leg shape. You need to have

67
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:56,970
him top heavy or bottom heavy. That looks pretty good anymore. There. Okay. This feet.

68
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:14,620
Those feet are fine. All right. Face. Holy shit. Oh boy. This. Look at all this. Really.

69
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:33,850
Oh neck. Oh, you could do. It looks like somebody's arm is up in a sock. This is a sock

70
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:44,679
puppet person. Neck width. This is just unsettling is what it is. Neck length.

71
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:58,809
It can be even longer than that. Jaw. Cheekbones. I guess we could go this way.

72
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:09,370
You can go either width. Oh, it just looks like, it's just like, like Greg House.

73
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:24,460
Wilson. I, uh, you know, I can't do a doctor house. Maybe I can. No, I can't. Is there a

74
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:38,649
character named Wilson in the game? Not the game. In the show? Yeah, there is. Okay. Looks

75
00:12:38,649 --> 00:13:05,450
all right. Arch. Let's see. Oh dear. This guy's not going to survive. You say that. Just

76
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:19,860
wait till he does. What's the, uh, what's that animal from? What's the ice age character?

77
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:35,299
The squirrel. No, not the Grinch. Definitely has to have kind of mad eyes. Yeah, that's sad

78
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:40,389
and surprised. This is very upset. No, not that upset. That's a little too much for me.

79
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:51,590
Can have his eyes bugging at his head. Now he's very concerned. That's good.

80
00:13:54,169 --> 00:14:08,409
Mmm. Two, no, right there's all right. It's kind of got the Homer Simpson. All right. No,

81
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:19,669
that looks all right. Eye height. Aye yi yi. All right, do we want him to have more face or

82
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:29,379
more head? I think more head. Didn't you already make this video? Yeah, but the only

83
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:35,179
difference is there are no mods on this. Eye size. This is just straight up out of the box.

84
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:47,269
Oh man, look at, you can go all the way in. What do you think? In or in? Yeah, it's got to be in.

85
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:58,860
It's that. All right. Wait, hold on. I did this other. What the fuck? Wait, hold on.

86
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:24,259
There's so many creatures. Why did I not know this existed? So this is the best game ever.

87
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,259
You're telling me that I can make other. Okay, hold on. Go back, go back, go back,

88
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:43,529
go back. This is really important. He's gone. Are you sure about that?

89
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:58,460
That was very surprising. He's fine. Oh, no, I can't have a guy be a butterfly. Shouldn't he be a

90
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:07,769
butterfly? All right. Guy, butterfly. Oh, he's the contortionist. This guy's going to be

91
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,450
one like America's Got Talent and try to fit himself into a box.

92
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:25,539
Okay. It can't be this. That's too much. He has to at least be able to stand. Okay. So

93
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:38,500
there are, look at, do you see how many people I can make? All right. Perfect. Hair. Hair. Haircut

94
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:47,220
four. I don't want to see any others. I don't think I should see any others.

95
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,740
I don't want to change it, but I kind of have to. Let's do it. Okay, hold on. What

96
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:31,980
about beards? No, it has to be the, it has to be that one little swoop over. That's it. 40.

97
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:52,519
Was it like six or seven? He just looks like any currently airing animated 3D boss of the

98
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,319
main character. And all those like 3D animated shows that are currently airing, this is like

99
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:12,549
the character's boss. Always. Okay. Beard. There's a lot of beard options. So hold on.

100
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,170
I love how this is just pasted on right here. That's clearly a fake beard. No, that's too easy.

101
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:36,299
That's all. That's too easy too. I mean, this is so easy, right? But I can, no,

102
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:45,910
I got to get rid of that. The way it was before. That's actually not bad.

103
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,170
Oh, you can do different hair color. Okay.

104
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:15,299
The Joker. No, I can't make him like a YouTuber. There we go.

105
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,569
Okay. This is like what happens when you dye your hair too many times.

106
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:32,980
So it looks good. I think that's good. Confirm.

107
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,710
Primarily from farmer cultures, they still tend to be an aggressive race and they're easily led

108
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,029
astray. The worst of them live in ignorance, knowing only greed and fear, reacting to

109
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,150
anything different with hatred and violence. But the best of them are some of the greatest

110
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:55,460
civilized scientists, engineers, and warriors in the land. Humans. Yeah, okay. What is,

111
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:03,750
what is that? I think I, I think we got our character. I'm ready. Confirm.

112
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:14,789
Naked dude. The great desert. Oh, this is elaborate. Okay. Basic controls.

113
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,869
You can move the camera with WASD to rotate your view. Hold the middle mouse button.

114
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:27,220
Okay. To zoom, use the mouse scroll. Okay. Where am I supposed to go?

115
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,119
I'm actually in the middle of the desert. Okay. The middle, the middle bottom panel shows

116
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,720
the character in your active squad. To select a squad member, left click the character on the

117
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:50,200
icon. Select the squad, left click the character icon on the panel. Okay. To give

118
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,730
a move order to your character, right click on the terrain. Easy. Double click on your

119
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:06,970
character icon to center on the screen and follow their movement. All right. So I can

120
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:13,289
hold. All right. Cool. You can hold it. Right click on characters or interactable objects

121
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:19,609
to interact. Hold the right mouse button on to get more available actions. Okay. So

122
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,440
I see. Why is it? Okay. I don't have a name. Splint injuries. I don't have a splint

123
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:39,109
kit. Okay. Basic controls. That's done. Move around like this. I didn't name him.

124
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:50,420
Okay. So we got that done. Overview. This shows your selection's current state,

125
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,500
statistics, and other basic info. Mouse over each item for more information. Okay.

126
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,730
Naked dude nameless. That's his first, middle, and last name. State normal, goal aimless.

127
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:11,819
No, no encumbrance. Martial arts? Minus nine. Strength zero, dexterity zero,

128
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:21,509
toughness one, dodge one. Okay. Interesting. So it's your dodge skill, your toughness skill.

129
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:26,710
Interesting. All right. What is this? Athletics XP. This is the rate at which your athletic skill

130
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:33,269
is increasing while running. Cool. This is the rate at which your strength is increasing. It's

131
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:41,990
zero percent toughness. Six times. Bleed multiplier. Head. Your head is okay. Your chest

132
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,710
is okay. Your stomach is okay. Your left arm, your limb is gone forever. Your right arm is okay.

133
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,869
Your left leg, everything's okay. And you are getting a little hungry. You're suffering from

134
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:56,869
malnutrition. Your stats and strength will be affected. You need to get some food as soon

135
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:07,240
as possible. Stat penalty is at times 88, .88. Okay. So now what? No jobs. To add jobs

136
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,789
holds shift when giving an order. Continue. This shows the selected character's current

137
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,109
health condition. Yeah, I figured that out. The arrow buttons allow you to pause and fast

138
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:30,299
forward the game speed. Pause. Got it. Okay. That's actually pretty cool. So this is just

139
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,940
like The Sims, but in a wasteland. This is awesome. Here you'll find your character's

140
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:44,700
current funds and the in-game time and date. Nothing. And this is the day and the time.

141
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:56,299
Okay. This opens the build menu. There's a build menu? Here you can place buildings

142
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,859
and start your own outpost anywhere in the world, but you should choose a safe area and

143
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:06,539
check availability of resources using the prospect button. You will also need building materials to

144
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:21,430
finish construction. Okay. So I need to prospect something first. Buildings. Small shack.

145
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,839
Building material? What do I have for building? Am I just going to make like a

146
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:44,259
fucking trash box? Should I just build a fucking cube? No, no, that's a bad place for that.

147
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,099
It's in the middle of the desert. I can't even get running water out there. All right.

148
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:54,180
That's the build menu. You can open your inventory. What is it? I'm in the build menu.

149
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:01,240
Shit. I got to get out of the build menu. Out. Okay. Here you can open your inventory,

150
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,000
skill statistics, world map, tech and squad management. For tips and tutorials,

151
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,309
make sure to check out the help menu at the very bottom. Character's inventory.

152
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:18,339
Oh, this is so cool. Limbs. Well, that's what I'm holding on my arms. Total weight.

153
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:34,710
Disguise. Okay. Status window. Toughness. Max carry weight. Dexterity. All right.

154
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,150
This is a lot. Look it up. There's a lot. There's an open world map.

155
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:53,609
What? What's that noise? I'm paused, right? Dude, this is, this is bigger than Northrend.

156
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:00,019
Okay, there's a city over here. Sho Bataille is over here. I got to make it over to the city,

157
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm assuming. Okay. Well, there's a couple of cities. There's bark, sho bataille, heft and

158
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:25,079
stroat. Okay. Faction. Dust bandits, slave hunters, research, crafting. How to research

159
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:37,589
squad. Dialogue. What? Did that, was that, what was that dialogue? All right. I'm going to

160
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:44,789
make it to, okay. I got, I got the basics down. This shows the jobs and orders for the selected

161
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:52,759
character. Jobs. No jobs. The job is make it to the city. Your character is hungry, missing a

162
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,140
limb. What do I do? There is no linear story or mission to guide you in Kenshi. Be a trader,

163
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,980
a thief, a bounty hunter, a farmer, or even a warlord. You'll need to explore the world and

164
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,539
find your own adventure. Tap the M key. You can use the world map to navigate and

165
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:17,769
find nearby towns or points of interest. So M, right, is the key. Oops. There we go.

166
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:25,369
Is a true open world. First things first, you need food and funds to survive. To get

167
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,970
started, you can either scavenge the outlands for loot, mine valuable materials from iron

168
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,450
ore veins, or you can even resort to thievery after nightfall. To cash in your loot,

169
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,369
you need to find a store. Use the map to navigate to a nearby town and find shops.

170
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,769
Surviving alone in the world of Kenshi won't be easy, but hiring new recruits will help.

171
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:47,529
Check the town bars for mercs or buy animal companions from any of the farms outside town.

172
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:51,849
Remember, you're not special and you're not stronger than anyone else. Train hard,

173
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:54,569
pick your fights wisely, and don't be afraid to run like crazy.

174
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:04,660
All right. What do you say? Huh? I'm ready to get started. Let's just go find a town.

175
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,900
You know what I mean? Let's go.

176
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,380
Give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give

177
00:29:04,519 --> 00:30:27,880
it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it a, give it

178
00:30:27,880 --> 00:32:00,309
a, juggernaut. Ow. God damn it. Where's my health. I'm going the wrong way. Quick, Bangal- Bangal tilt. Come on, where is the town? I'm not close to a town. I'm so far away from this place. Chest. Stomach. Lee- okay, I've still got had a pretty good head on my shoulders though. This is actually kind of brutal. This is nothing I can do about this. Don't fuck with us. I didn't, you came after me. Naked dude has been enslaved. Jobs, obedient slave. Uh alright. Leave him alone. Right I'm trying

179
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:14,710
Do I get up? What is he doing to me? He's been doing this for a really long time.

180
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:24,059
Your character is hung, you need food to survive. You can grow food, buy it, hunt it, or steal it.

181
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,859
Your squad will automatically eat whatever food is in their inventory.

182
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:33,140
So am I getting brought into a squad? He's healing me. This guy just let me in his squad.

183
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,420
All right, you appear to be missing a limb. Limbs are useful things to have,

184
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,220
so you may want to get that replaced. You can buy various robotic limbs.

185
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:48,039
Okay, install new limbs using the robotics. Robotic limbs require skeleton repair kits.

186
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:54,569
Okay, he actually is healing me. This is great. Building gates and walls. When building walls,

187
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:58,730
you need to be careful not to place them facing inside out. The arrows you see show the outside

188
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:05,259
facing direction. You can use the and buttons to rotate before placing them. As with other

189
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:08,619
buildings, you can only place them when they glow green. Yep, once you're happy, left click

190
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:20,230
to set it down. You got it. What the fuck? How do I like keep centered on myself?

191
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:41,960
Where's the camp? Double click your icon. Okay, there we go. Right. Well, he folded me up

192
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,400
like a blanket. I guess we're just going to be with this guy now. Okay.

193
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:49,880
Oh, fine. I'll just read tutorials while you walk me around. That's good. Welcome to build

194
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,269
mode. Uh, boo. Yep. Select the building and get a building a small shack will allow you

195
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:00,150
to build a research bench. That's $50 that came in by and I can't even see because

196
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,670
the text is so small. I don't know what I did. Something from the Christmas Eve stream.

197
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:13,670
I'm unconscious. Well, look at where at least we're going 12 miles per hour. This guy can

198
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:22,820
run pretty fast. Uh, but first of all, thank you to soup set for the $50. Happy late Christmas

199
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:31,260
big boy. Thank you. You as well. Thank you so much for the $50. Wait, hold on. I gotta

200
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:38,010
pay attention. Wait, are we just catching up with me? We're just catching up with the other

201
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:50,329
people. What is that? Don't trip over that. Those are his buddies. This is his. Yeah,

202
00:34:50,329 --> 00:35:13,449
this is the squad. Hey, what's up guys? Yeah. I'm the new squad member. I'm not really,

203
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:28,789
I'm not really doing anything. Am I just pretend it's an online game? Yeah. It can't

204
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:37,539
isn't it? Doesn't this happen in some of these online RPGs? Building a shack will

205
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,940
allow you to build a research bench inside. You can learn new techniques, new shoes,

206
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,739
where to place a building on the terrain. Yes. Yes. Yes. Rotate the position using

207
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:48,260
the and keys. Yeah. Select squad members and right click the construction to begin

208
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,480
adding materials if they have them. Right. Much quicker depending on the number. Just

209
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,679
like in Warcraft, the more orcs you put on the building, the more they could build it.

210
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,679
How to craft. You are injured. You are under attack. Use the spacebar to pause the action.

211
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:06,199
This would give you some time to think and plan your next step. When you're outnumbered,

212
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,559
it may be best to jump ship and flee. If you choose to flee, right click on the terrain

213
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,119
to move your character. Make sure you have your character selected. If you do choose

214
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,719
to stand and fight, select your squad members, hold right click on the target enemy and

215
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:24,619
select attack target. OT attack all from the interaction menu. Just right clicking on an

216
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,460
enemy when the cursor is red also gives you an attack order. Okay. That's, that's what I

217
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,070
thought. You can also, you can select more specific combat modes from the right side

218
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,670
command menu. Block focuses on defense over attack. Passive focuses on non-combat.

219
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:45,030
Chases focuses on chasing down enemies. Taunt focuses on drawing enemy attacks.

220
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:50,230
You've been enslaved. You can either live out the rest of your life as a slave or

221
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,260
you can break free and escape. Your character will automatically behave obediently to their master.

222
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,980
If you want to escape, you'll need to dismiss the obedience slave auto job by pressing the

223
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:16,579
X. Okay. Let's go. I'm out. You can then hold right click on your character to bring up the

224
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:23,940
interaction menu and unlock your shackles to escape. Careful even if you escape successfully,

225
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:37,559
you're branded a slave. Oh, I'm unconscious. Just unlock your shackles. All right. I think

226
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,260
we got it. You are KO'd. You've been knocked out. If seriously wounded, the unconscious

227
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,260
status will change to dying and the character won't get back up until healed by another character.

228
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,929
If they don't get first aid in time, they'll eventually die, which is what we saw.

229
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:54,809
Even after healing, a character will need time to recover before regaining consciousness.

230
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,050
Particularly bad injuries will enter the character into a recovery coma until their

231
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:08,550
vitals happen. What the fuck is happening? Is he using me as a weapon out of a it's

232
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:22,980
come on it's a jailbreak ghetto. Is there animals? What is this like a pig dog? Come

233
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:32,199
on. Come on. Break free. Break free. Come on. Where did the dog just go?

234
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:45,500
That guy went up into the sky apparently. What was this powerful? They did it. They saved me.

235
00:38:46,599 --> 00:39:13,480
Thanks for the rescue. Hello? Uh, hello? You know, check. I'm still alive down here.

236
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:25,849
I could use some help. What was the point of that? So there's just another army of

237
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:39,800
raiders. What are these? Okay, hold on up. I'm still, I'm gonna be just fine. This is perfect.

238
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:50,250
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Why are they getting up? Why are they getting up?

239
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:57,159
No, no, I just don't, don't come get me. Come on. He's running. I think this is a

240
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:12,170
perfect opportunity. No, they're looting each other. No, I really don't understand. They're

241
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,630
looting the dead bodies. Are they just going to, are they going to forget that I exist?

242
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:32,630
Because I'm technically unconscious. 1700 more seconds. No, they're healing each other.

243
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,130
Something's going on over here. Uh, that doesn't look like it's very appealing.

244
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:51,719
Yeah, they're gonna forget about me. Let's fast forward. 1600. Hold on. Yep. Wait,

245
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:59,340
what'd he say? Wow, wow, wow. What'd he say? Walk right over me. Come on. Oh my fucking god.

246
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:17,449
It's like it never happened. Is this dangerous? I feel like these sandstorms are dangerous.

247
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:39,750
Well, I got another 1600 seconds. What? Wait, why is there a giant bunk? Hold on a second.

248
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:55,659
Get off of this. Hold on. What is this? Put me down. Why are you just standing there with my

249
00:41:55,659 --> 00:42:29,539
body? Where did I go? Why am I still bouncing around? And with my daring escape. Did they

250
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:45,900
kill it? No. How did you kill this thing? Can I please just get to a town? How much more time do

251
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:58,949
I have? 1400 seconds. They forgot about me. This is my perfect opportunity to lie here and

252
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:04,230
just be dead. They don't care about me. I went too far. They forgot. They thought I died.

253
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:16,489
Perfect. Don't remember. Come on. Just keep going that way. No, no, no, no, no. No.

254
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:25,579
Just walk by my body. Don't come over here. It's too dusty. You can't even see anyways.

255
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:45,610
I think we're in the clear. I just have to sit here for 1300 seconds. All right. We'll make our

256
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:53,349
escape very soon. I can unlock my shackles. Nobody around, right? No giant bugs. All right,

257
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:04,139
here we go. I just need to wait this out. And then I'm going to eat that bug. I can eat the

258
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:21,300
bug, right? Bug is back up. How can I? I can't eat that. Can I eat some of these things? The

259
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:32,260
bug's not going to see me if I stand up. What's like the view distance? I think the bug died.

260
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:50,820
Is this dead? Wounded. Blood, head. It's slowly getting worse. Okay, this this bug is deer.

261
00:44:51,820 --> 00:45:18,170
Okay, hold on. I'm not food, right? I don't think so. This is a long time to be unconscious.

262
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:37,159
It's going to be cold and I need to get to the town. I'm going to try. I got to zoom out.

263
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:52,619
So much dust everywhere. There's the bug. I got to have a game plan when I get up.

264
00:45:52,619 --> 00:46:08,469
This feels... I think you would be dead by now, wouldn't you? If you were unconscious

265
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:26,099
out here for this long. What's a bug fighting? Some more raiders. I need to take... I need to see

266
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:32,820
the map. I'm so close to this town. I can put a waypoint here. I'm just going to bang right

267
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:40,329
a little bit in straight. It's down there. Oh, it's right there. Okay, I just got to get to

268
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:55,719
the town. Only like five sped up minutes before I can get over there. Can this sandstorm let

269
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:22,329
up so I can see? Almost there. Okay, hold on. Take a look around. I don't see anything. I'm

270
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:36,699
just gonna make a beeline for the town. 200 seconds. I gotta get food. I gotta get to work.

271
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:56,099
I gotta get armor. I need money. All right, here we go. There's a band over here. All right,

272
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,579
I'm actually kind of nervous because this is the first time I've had control in like 10

273
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:07,500
minutes. Almost 20 minutes without control. It's dark too. I gotta wait. Okay, almost not...

274
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:18,420
Almost conscious. It's morning. I'm okay. Here we go. Three, two, one, wake up.

275
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:26,150
Playing dead. If enemies are still nearby, a character might play dead in order to avoid

276
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,710
further fighting. To get right... to get up right click to move, just to make sure there

277
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:40,170
are no enemies around. Okay, all right, get these off. Unlock shackles. I only have a 23%

278
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:54,519
chance to get this off. Oh man. Is the chance going down or up? It's going up. Does this

279
00:48:54,519 --> 00:49:05,699
use brain power? I don't think so. Oh, fuck. Here comes the bug. 24% chance. Come on. That's

280
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:17,610
one out of four. One out of five. I did it five times already. I'm getting skill up

281
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:28,809
and lockpicking though. What am I picking it with? Um, the sand. I'm filling the lock with

282
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:42,329
sand and trying to smash it open. So I'm branded as an escaped slave. I'm gonna starve

283
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:57,670
to death out here trying to get this off, aren't I? Oh, come on. Seriously? No, get up.

284
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:36,099
Fight him. I'm all right. I got it. Get me out of here. Come on. No, no, go this way. I can't

285
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:45,269
run. I'm so fucked up. I need to get to this town. My legs... my left leg is destroyed.

286
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:56,389
My chest is destroyed. I'm going so slow. I still have the shackles on. I... no, I don't,

287
00:50:56,389 --> 00:51:12,070
do I? I don't have any first aid. Get there. Come on, shimmy grandpa. Let's go. I'm so close.

288
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:28,150
I gotta go to the front gates. Inventory. Boots. Prisoner shackles. Are these armor? Heavy

289
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,510
prisoner shackles. They stop you from running and doing a lot of things. They will trip you up

290
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,070
in combat. They are locked on. You need to pick the lock somehow. This item isn't locked,

291
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:46,019
but it can stop a sword. I'm good. All right. Run. That didn't mean... it doesn't matter.

292
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:55,130
I can't run. Do you see all my problems here? Do you see all my sim problems? My chest, right arm,

293
00:51:55,130 --> 00:52:01,590
left leg, and hunger meter. I'll have to go to the bathroom really bad. My chest is going to

294
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:17,190
piss its pants in about 15 seconds. I'll get there. I don't see anybody, although I'm going

295
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:23,849
out... kind of going the back door here. Wait, hold on. I see people here. What do I do?

296
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:29,480
Towns. You've discovered your first town. Towns are perfect for stopping up on supplies and selling

297
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,239
loot. To cash in your loot, you'll need to find a store. Hold alt to show nearby shop signs.

298
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:44,869
Okay. I don't have anything. Be wary of entering private buildings. Residents often

299
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:48,869
don't like trespassers. You can find out whether a building is marked public or private

300
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:54,780
by selecting the building. Also, most shops are closed at night. Let's get these out of the

301
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,019
way here. Too much damage can result in a KO, crippling, and death. The green bars and the

302
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:03,659
health panels show your health. The red bars show bleeding damage. Bleeding damage will need

303
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:09,429
first aid. In order to heal, you need to get a first aid kit. You can buy or steal them from

304
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:16,170
stores in town. You are injured too. To heal a character, you need first aid kit in your inventory.

305
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:21,050
Hold and right click the target, then select first aid. From the menu or simply right click

306
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:27,110
the heal icon over the injured person. Yeah. Here it is. First aid. I don't have a med kit. Yeah.

307
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:33,130
I'd like to know the next step, but maybe it just assumes that I'm on the next step

308
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:42,230
because I can't- I don't have any of these things. I wish- I want to see like the other-

309
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,750
if I hit skip, it's gonna skip the whole thing, isn't it? Do I have to be unpaused

310
00:53:47,750 --> 00:54:03,239
while reading it? Okay. I don't think so. All right. Just making sure that I wasn't

311
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,000
gonna skip at all. Alternatively, you can click the medic button from the right side

312
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,960
command menu. This will heal all wounded squad members within range. So this one. So I'm gonna-

313
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,269
I'm gonna get a band of merry men. Just you wait. The yellow areas of the health bar show

314
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:29,510
bandaged health. Over time, this will slowly heal back to a healthy green. Okay. All body

315
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,869
parts are each affected in their own way. Your head, chest, and stomach are your vitals.

316
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,469
So these are vitals. Head, chest, and stomach are vitals. If any of them fall below zero,

317
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:47,380
you will pass out. And if they reach minus 100, you will die. Well, all right. That's good to

318
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:53,739
know. If any of the limbs fall below zero, you won't be able to fight or walk properly. You

319
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:59,420
can use a splint kit on broken limbs to speed up recovery and improve the limb's function if

320
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,429
recovered. Okay. The blood stat shows how rapidly you are losing blood. Blood is slowly

321
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:10,650
recovered over time, but if it drops below zero, you will pass out. After using a first

322
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,690
aid kit to bandage your wounds, sleeping in a bed will help you fully recover.

323
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:18,730
You need to build your own beds and camp beds or stay at a bar in town for free.

324
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:29,030
Let's get in there. Where's the front door? There are people everywhere over here.

325
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:42,199
Come on. I'm a dying man. Are these storm wind guards? These have to be storm wind

326
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:46,199
guards, right? As they walk up to a storm wind guard and ask where the fucking train is.

327
00:55:46,199 --> 00:56:05,349
Where's the tram? I keep forgetting where it is. Dust storm. Okay. Just get me in here.

328
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:26,570
Why is that? Why are you carrying somebody? Uh, I need help. Citizen. Is this a citizen?

329
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:37,670
How do I interact? Uh, bodyguard. Follow. That's okay. It's samurai. Can I talk?

330
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,739
Why is nobody helping me? This is an elaborate town. All right. Get in there.

331
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:03,610
I'm just like shimmying around. I need food. I need shelter. I need anything. Somebody please

332
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:17,559
save me. Well, what's wrong here? What was that? Attack a guard to get healed. Oh,

333
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:24,139
don't give me that. These guys are freaking me out. Why are you all running like this?

334
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:30,900
You're just going to bump into me? A dying guy that's covered in blood,

335
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:38,360
desperately looking for help. Nobody has done anything for me. Is this just supposed

336
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:53,449
to be normal? Please help me. This is the commander. Gate sergeant. Is there like an emote?

337
00:57:54,780 --> 00:58:11,239
How do I? Can I just go in? Is this loud in the city? Um, no, no, no. I don't want that.

338
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:28,969
Jobs. Taunt. Sneak. Wave. How do I like say hello? Oh, okay. I can just go in. All right.

339
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:50,300
First aid. I don't have any money. Go to the bar. Quick. Help me please. I can't go on.

340
00:58:50,300 --> 00:59:08,250
What? Oh, wait. No, no. Get off me. I have. Why am I unconscious? I don't get it. What happened

341
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:17,079
to me? At least he's going to heal me. At least I'm getting free heals. I passed out at the

342
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:22,889
steps of the town. This guy, the only guy in town recognizes me as a slave and decides,

343
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:26,010
all right, yeah, I'm going to go pick him up. He fell. He fell asleep on the walkway.

344
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:40,809
That's great. It is free heals though. Look, double heals. It's because this is a slave or

345
00:59:40,889 --> 01:00:09,480
town. Oh, well, will they at least feed me in here? What the? Do they give slaves weapons?

346
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,079
That's a, it's like, okay, here's your, what you do and here's what you're going to do and

347
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:30,980
here's your, here's your knife. Is he taking me to the bar? Where am I going? Oh man,

348
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,659
when we just found our first few characters that are going to, we're going to join together.

349
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:53,510
Uh, I kind of turned into a t-shirt somehow. How to escape a prison. You've committed a

350
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:58,789
crime and been in prison. What crime? You need to wait out your sentence, have another squad member

351
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:03,269
bail you out, or you can try to escape. To escape a prison cell, you need to use your lock

352
01:01:03,269 --> 01:01:07,190
picking skills. Select your imprisoned character and hold right click on the cage to bring up

353
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:16,360
the interaction menu. Select lock pick. The character must be conscious. Now you need to wait

354
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:20,519
for success. The speed it takes to lock, to pick a lock is dependent on each individual's

355
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:25,239
thievery skill. Once successful, hold right click again on the cage and select escape. You

356
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:32,980
may want to wait until any nearby captors are distracted. Am I, I'm in a recovery coma.

357
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:53,079
I'm technically kind of out of the cage. How long am I in a recovery coma? I gotta break out

358
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,400
and I'm gonna break out all these people and I'm gonna put them in my squad and we're gonna

359
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:11,369
escape. I'm getting up. Okay, am I awake? Use tools, use strength. I'm not strong enough to do that.

360
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:22,570
Unlock shackles and the pick lock is at one percent. I'm never getting out of this cage.

361
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:49,849
Just do it a hundred times. Yeah, I got it. Okay, get them off. All right, let's get this open.

362
01:02:51,110 --> 01:03:10,019
I'm not skilled enough. I can't even do it. Escape. Now I'm stuck here. It's only been one

363
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:32,900
day. Okay, I'm not obedient anymore. I have to reset. Game over. Use strength and lift up

364
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:42,230
the cage. Well, I can't do that. So what, what happened? How long do you sit in here for?

365
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:58,539
Somebody will buy me? Do I get like a percentage of that money? Normal. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

366
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:12,500
Whoa, whoa. All right, I'm not skilled enough. You're a slave. Don't forget it. I mean,

367
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:20,840
yes, I'm aware of that. Oh, it's good. I took the shackles off. You put the shackles

368
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:38,360
back on. Well, at least I got pants. So why would somebody want to buy me? How many

369
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:52,380
days do I have to sit in here? Take them off. Is he going to be mad about that? Am I like an

370
01:04:52,380 --> 01:05:08,409
unruly baby? This is my life now. I guess I was standing there for a very long time.

371
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:21,300
How do I get out of here? How do I like act? When does somebody come get me?

372
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:25,800
Practice lockpicking. I'm just going to keep taking my shackles up and putting them back

373
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:54,500
on. This is a good practice. Thanks for the training dummy. All right, I got them off. All

374
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:02,300
right. Now pick lock still at 1%. Use strength. Escape. He's going to notice. He's

375
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:12,780
going to come over and put them back on. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Put it back on. Give

376
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:27,289
me more training. Thank you. No, no, no. My training went, my sensei went downstairs.

377
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:39,880
I need him. It's all, it's nighttime. People are going to bed. How do I see my actual stats?

378
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:55,289
Status, window, combat, thievery. Lockpicking is at 9. Not bad. Why is everybody else just

379
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:59,929
standing there? Because I think they've accepted their fate. Not me though. I'm

380
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:02,969
going to practice every damn day to get to a point where I can open this door

381
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,809
and then I'm going to sprint punch that guy in his mouth as hard as I can.

382
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:18,730
Got it. What level is my lockpicking now? Lockpicking 11. The ability to pick locks,

383
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,610
open doors and safes. More importantly, however, it's also used to break out of

384
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,929
situations. Cages, jails, handcuffs. It's for those who have value freedom and don't want,

385
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:32,420
don't want to wait around to be rescued. Okay. Thievery is also here.

386
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:43,530
And I'm just going to wait to get the shackles put on again. Just put them back on myself?

387
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:54,230
How can I lock them? This is just doing the Rubik's cube. I can't like lock them again.

388
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,760
No, I can't. I have to wait for the guy to come out. Practice on the door. I can't.

389
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:15,940
I don't have enough skill to attempt the door. Save the shackles to sell them.

390
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:26,970
Really? How much are they worth? They're worth nothing. They have no sell value. Okay.

391
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:40,340
You can sell the shackles for iron. Eat the shackles. Speaking of food, when do they feed you?

392
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:48,329
Because it's been two days and I haven't gotten any food. And then unlock the other...

393
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:55,640
All right, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to unlock this door and then I'm going

394
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,640
to get put in this one. I'm going to unlock this one. I'm going to keep unlocking the doors

395
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:08,069
until I have 100 in lockpicking. All right, here we go. Here they come. They're going to

396
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:21,449
notice again. Maybe they'll have food this time. He's been playing for an hour and hasn't

397
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:37,689
done anything. No, I mean, hey, welcome to... Welcome to Kenshi! I hear anointed... I did

398
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:41,689
pick one of the hardest things in the game though. So, you know, I can... I should go

399
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:54,520
back properly eventually here and do one of the other scenarios. I'm going to... I'm going

400
01:09:54,520 --> 01:10:02,779
to die. I'm going to starve to death in this cage. Uh-oh, he's learning. Shut it down.

401
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:12,149
No, I'm interested. I'm not giving up on this character yet. I still have faith that I might

402
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:23,560
be able to pull something off here. Do they feed us? When... How do we do anything?

403
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:34,390
There's a barrel. Can I do anything with the... Oh! Papa just got a new pair of pants.

404
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:53,899
How did I get caught stealing? Oh, what is... You rats. What do you mean got caught...

405
01:10:53,899 --> 01:11:11,079
Where are they? I... Who took them? I didn't even get them. All right, stealing chance. 46%.

406
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:24,810
Get them. Got them. Oh, get fucked. Get fucked over, game. You've just stolen from

407
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:33,930
someone. Be careful when selling stolen goods to traders. You might just find yourself in

408
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:42,149
trouble with the law if they catch you. Oh, get fucking destroyed. You didn't think I had

409
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:52,069
as long arms. How to steal. Be careful. Yeah, well, that doesn't mean anything. I still have

410
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:58,220
to get out of here. Be careful when selling stolen goods to traders. You might just find

411
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:02,539
yourself in trouble with the law if they catch you offloading their allies' belongings. When

412
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:05,899
you talk to a trader, initiate the trade screen, hover over a stolen item, check the

413
01:12:05,899 --> 01:12:12,060
chances of fencing success before selling. If the fencing chance is low and it was stolen from

414
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:17,180
someone in the same faction, you'll likely be caught. Your best chance of selling stolen

415
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:21,020
goods is to sell to a trader from another town and faction or find a thief in one of the

416
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:25,739
town bars. Thieves will buy any item off you risk free. However, their prices

417
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:30,729
are much less profitable than the official merchant. Careful trying to open locked

418
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:35,210
items and doors is illegal and could land you in trouble. Well, if you get caught,

419
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:41,369
as a rule, if the cursor shows red, then that action is hostile. Right. Like every other game.

420
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,680
Entering sneak mode will help reduce the chance of you getting caught while committing crimes.

421
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,560
You can find the sneak button at the bottom of the right of the UI. So like down here.

422
01:12:53,510 --> 01:13:00,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. OI! Wait, do I get out? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Something's

423
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:32,420
happening here. Okay, cool. Hold on, I gotta put my new pants on. Where are we going? I

424
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:42,250
thought I don't have shackles on anymore. No, I do. Make a break for it. But to where though? I

425
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:48,659
don't have anything. I don't have any money. I just got a new pair of pants. I lost the group.

426
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:53,640
I lost the group on the field trip. I don't remember where I'm supposed to go. Where did

427
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:09,430
they go? I lost the group. Is this them? I lost the group on the fucking field trip. I swear

428
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:19,859
to God. I don't know where anybody went. I'm going out the front door. I got a pair of

429
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:35,930
pants I can sell for one cent. I'm gonna go to the next town. Get me out of here. No, don't touch me.

430
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:47,609
What if I just hide over here? Where's the sneak button? Sneak. Is this sneak? I don't know what

431
01:14:47,609 --> 01:15:14,649
that means. What's wrong? What? What? No, get me out of here. Go down. Go down. Quick, I need

432
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:40,420
a bug. Oh, come on. I can't, I can't sprint with these on. I should have kept sneaking.

433
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:57,460
Where are we going? He's taking me up the slide. This is cool. What's going on up here? Who's this

434
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:15,189
guy? Wait, why are they all freaking out over here? What are you all doing? Oh, I have the,

435
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:37,239
I can do it now. I leveled up enough where I can do it. Did I get it? Okay, I got it set free.

436
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:42,779
Not yet. Unlock shackles. I'm gonna wait till it's nighttime and I'm fucking out of here.

437
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:47,050
I need to, I gotta steal food from somebody's house or something, don't I? All right, wait till

438
01:16:47,050 --> 01:17:00,760
night. I can open the door. I'm gonna free the other, the other slaves too. All right, time for

439
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:10,569
night. Just wait till nighttime. We've got a little bit, we gotta wait and I'm gonna, I'm

440
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:28,100
gonna build a shack in here. This is my new home. Okay, let's go. Uncheck obedience slave. Not yet.

441
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:49,460
Nighttime. When everybody gets put up here, we're talked to. Hey, dude. No, that's his

442
01:17:49,460 --> 01:18:04,920
naked dude. How do I talk? Outlaw farmer. I'm too far away. I'm breaking this guy out

443
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:12,899
and we're making a run for it. I can hear a bunch of noises. Hold on. Steal his food. He

444
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:17,670
doesn't have any food. He's in a cage. Move to the cage next to him.

445
01:18:19,909 --> 01:18:36,600
So you tell, can I, all right, hold on. Nobody up here, right? Okay. All right. Okay, now I can

446
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:44,920
talk. What are you looking at? You want to get out of here, don't you? So what are you in

447
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,890
for? I'm busting out of here. Are you with me or not? You want to get out of here? He

448
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:54,630
says, yeah. Let's bust these cages open and run. Then help me get out of here. Let's make

449
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:58,810
a break for it. We'll have a better chance if we escape together. All right, let's get these

450
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:10,939
cages open. No, no, no, not right now. Wait till night time. My first friend, but I, he's

451
01:19:10,939 --> 01:19:20,220
going to die because we're both going to die. I mean, I can pick the lock that I just got in.

452
01:19:20,779 --> 01:19:31,300
Nothing in there. God damn it. Are they going to remember that I was in this cage over here?

453
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:41,239
I'm starving. I know. Oh, my first squad member. Hey, get me out. Okay. I think I just

454
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:51,289
have to open it. Pick his lock. Okay. Unlock my cage first. Yeah, I know, I know, I know,

455
01:19:51,289 --> 01:20:05,670
but I, what if they come up here? Are they going to know that, use him as a distraction?

456
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:15,750
Just eat him. I'm not going to eat him. Okay. I'm not opening the door. I'm going to wait till

457
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:29,750
night. I don't want to open his door yet. Okay. Here we go. Shhh. Guards back up here.

458
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:36,010
The guard's going to see the shackles. Uh oh. Willy though? They're on. Is that enough to,

459
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:40,279
let me just get these out of here. By toggling sneaky or entering stealth mode,

460
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:43,239
in this mode you can perform stealth knockouts, kidnaps, and steal stuff.

461
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:48,260
The stealth cursor displays two icons, an eyeball and a sun. When the eyeball is red,

462
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,260
it means you are in view of nearby NPCs. When the eyeball is blue, it means that you are

463
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,579
currently out of anyone's line of sight. The sun icon shows the light level. When the sun

464
01:20:56,579 --> 01:21:02,470
is shaded, you are at your least visible. Nightfall is prime for sneaking. Right click

465
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:06,470
on an NPC while sneaking. The percentage shows the chance of success. The higher your

466
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:09,590
assassination skill, the higher the chance of doing a stealth knockout. To kidnap

467
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:16,220
a KOed NPC, hold right click on them. It's like kidnap. How to research. To research new tech,

468
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:19,819
such as buildings, defensive weapons, blah blah blah. You need a research bench from the build

469
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:27,140
menu. Okay. So just a Minecraft bench. Either you can buy a house in a town or you can build

470
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:32,789
your own house outside of an NPC town. To craft items, you need to build a workbench

471
01:21:32,789 --> 01:21:37,640
from the crafting menu. First things first though, you're going to need to research all

472
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,479
the necessary buildings, equipment, and schematics you need for crafting. Build a research bench

473
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,199
to learn new techs and crafts. Got it. I just want to get those off the screen.

474
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:54,460
All right. It's time of night. Not quite. Almost there. Enslaved the slavers that enslaved

475
01:21:54,460 --> 01:22:00,970
you. I mean, they have full armor and weapons. We have to break out of here at night

476
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:05,130
and sneak out the front door. No, the back door. Are there back doors?

477
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:17,880
Don't slow it down. Well, I'm just, I'm scared that somebody's going to, they're

478
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:28,619
all going to run up here. You're still on board, right? Quick. Look for a way. Okay.

479
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:35,239
Yeah. I got the, it's in motion. The wheels are in motion. Activate sneak to train stealth.

480
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:48,359
Is that really? Don't worry. The town will belong to you in a few hours.

481
01:22:49,079 --> 01:23:06,810
There's a ladder on the right. Ooh, good eyes there. Good eyes. I'm starving.

482
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:20,010
I'm going to pass out, aren't I? If this goes down any further. All right. Somebody

483
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:25,960
just got the shit beat out of them. They just fell down. There's fresh meat in the

484
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:35,300
cage and next to me. Let me scope this place out though. Cause we, I do need food.

485
01:23:35,859 --> 01:23:44,659
I'm going to have to take the bread from somebody. Hold on. Let me, where is there like an

486
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:58,970
inn? Hold alt. Okay. Here we go. So this is prisoner shackles. What? Okay. There we go.

487
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:04,649
Right here. I'm going to sneak out. This is that those look like dumplings or something,

488
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:08,250
right? Well, like potatoes. I'm going in here and I'm going to take the thing on the front

489
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:29,930
desk and we can share it as friends. Ice cream. Here we go. It's time for nightfall.

490
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:35,739
Should I open up every cage? That might be a good idea. Or just stick with the plan.

491
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:57,270
All right. Open up every cage or stick with the plan. Which one? It's not technically

492
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:05,899
really night yet. That's what everybody's asleep. Open, open. No, not yet. The

493
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:12,329
people walking around all over the place. Save the game. That's a really, really good idea.

494
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:41,619
There's an auto, it's auto saves every 10 minutes, but there. So close.

495
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:48,579
Play the pink panther theme. No, that's too distracting. This is, this game's on, see?

496
01:25:48,579 --> 01:25:53,300
Everyone that wanted me to go, there's a night guard right here that goes to sleep in like two

497
01:25:53,300 --> 01:26:08,220
hours. I would have walked right into him. Here we go. When he goes to bed, it's time to get

498
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:24,939
up. Just go. I can't just go. Don't you understand? It has to be perfect. I don't have

499
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:35,140
any items. I'm starving. Here we go. Right, he's down there. I don't know, whatever he's doing at

500
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:47,560
night. Rapidly. Whatever he's doing, whatever he's up to down there. All right, is it time? No,

501
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:58,619
he's not done. He's not done yet. There's two people doing it too. I don't know where the

502
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:31,189
second person came from. Okay, but he's downstairs. I think he's done. Use the

503
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:38,600
ladder. He came back. I didn't know if he came back or not. I didn't, I thought, I thought he,

504
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:46,710
when does he go to sleep? It's 2 a.m. No, he's going back downstairs to like masturbate again.

505
01:27:46,710 --> 01:28:03,670
No, he's gone. Let's go. Get it? No, there it is. All right, we got plenty of time. He's

506
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:19,979
got 65 tabs open. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where am I? Wait, where did I, where's my

507
01:28:19,979 --> 01:28:43,689
character? Oh, go, go, Jeremy, go. Just go, go. I opened the door and he screamed. Is he

508
01:28:43,689 --> 01:29:05,369
alive? He didn't even wait for me. They're all down there having a great time. Wait, hey.

509
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:18,060
No, why is this guy, he didn't cut his leg off. Oh, what the fuck? I can't get out of here.

510
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:29,140
How am I supposed to get out of here? I need to help him. Honest to God. Okay, he,

511
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:49,960
I gotta eat this guy. I have to eat him. How do I eat him? Why can they hear, I don't understand.

512
01:29:49,960 --> 01:30:13,319
Why can they hear us? This, I was sneaking. Is it, every time, I'm unconscious. All right,

513
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:43,739
so when the door opens, they just run up here. I'm safe scumming. Okay, so let me,

514
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:53,159
let me understand this. So when I, I'm going to open his door. What, really dude, come on.

515
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:20,779
Give me a break. Turn off obedience. I'm on sneak, but when I open.

516
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:41,060
All right, will you get the fuck out of here? Turn off jobs. I'm on the sprint setting. All

517
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:46,659
right, here he goes. Here we go. One, two, three, obedience slave off. Sneak on. Jobs off.

518
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:59,619
Open door. Escape. Sneak on. What the hell are you doing? Escape. What? What, did I go back in?

519
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:28,550
What? Obedience slave off. Sneak on. Open his lock. Oh my God, he's back. Get out of here.

520
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:37,319
Shackles. I know, I know, I know. Wait till he gets out of here. Let the other guy out. Not,

521
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:41,899
not with this guy sitting right here. He can't see you. You can escape if you sneak. He's

522
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:47,899
not going to do that. This random party member. I'm going to open his door and see what happens.

523
01:32:49,539 --> 01:32:52,420
Because every time I open his door, he freaks out and just starts sprinting.

524
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:04,649
Fuck him. Leave him. Look, see? Look, this is not my fault. This is his fault.

525
01:33:06,729 --> 01:33:17,739
Can I like tell him to just not do this? Let's go to the squad tab. He's not here.

526
01:33:17,979 --> 01:34:06,779
This is how to do it. I need my... What? Wait, wait. How? They weren't even here.

527
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:33,979
The ladder. I can't even use this ladder. How do I know? Because everybody in chat has been

528
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:43,670
saying I can't use it. I've seen at least five people say that ladder's a prop. Watch. I'll

529
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:46,949
tell you. Let's see if the ladder's a prop. Let's see if I'm getting baited here. Let's

530
01:34:46,949 --> 01:35:05,399
see if the ladder's a prop. Take off sprint. Let's check the ladder. Hey, look. The ladder's

531
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:18,300
a prop. This is why I didn't try it. Oh, fuck. I'm out. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

532
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:35,140
wait, wait, wait. How am I supposed to get out of here? I can't sneak out of here. I can't even

533
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:46,739
see in the building. He's going to cause a distraction. I have an idea. I'm going to

534
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:51,609
open it. I'm going to sneak this way. Once I open it, I got to move this way quick.

535
01:35:52,170 --> 01:36:08,090
I'm going to pause it. Floor button. Floor button. Okay. Ooh, fuck. Okay, hold on.

536
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:21,369
I can sneak by that. This guy causes a problem every time though. Watch. Good.

537
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:37,829
All right. Why is he sneaking now? Do you understand? He didn't do this before.

538
01:36:37,829 --> 01:36:52,619
Go. Get over there. What are you doing? I didn't stop sneaking. Look. It's right here.

539
01:36:56,039 --> 01:37:06,899
Fuck this guy. I'm leaving him. I'm taking him. I have to uncheck this box. What? This

540
01:37:06,899 --> 01:37:23,510
guy causes a problem every time. I'm taking his stuff. Here. Like, you know what? Deal with it.

541
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:44,579
Here. You can have this. I'll just dress you. You can have the shackles too.

542
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:50,380
I can't manage him. What? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened?

543
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:57,909
What happened? Did he just take the clothes? Why did he take my clothes?

544
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:11,609
He realized. Give me his weapon. Where's his weapon? I can't grab his weapon.

545
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:22,569
Still the guard's weapon? No, it's this. All right. I got a weapon.

546
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:33,239
Legally blind. No, it was like a weird stick. Okay. So, this guy ruins it every time.

547
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:37,720
I open the door and he just walks out. He doesn't wait. He doesn't wait for me. He just goes.

548
01:38:37,720 --> 01:39:07,770
I can't control him. He just fucking walks away. He took you. I know he took the stick.

549
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:28,489
Kind of like hiding the barrel. Is this building on fire? What the fuck?

550
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:38,439
Okay. Look. So, we've got guy at the table. Guy over here. What is in there? I wonder.

551
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:59,479
Oh shit. Okay. Hold on a minute here. Will these guys see? I mean, what's their line

552
01:39:59,479 --> 01:40:10,310
of sight like? Oh, I'm good. Just please tell me nobody comes over here. I'm going to loot

553
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:22,899
everything over here. Let's go right to the box. You gotta be kidding me. He saw me through

554
01:40:22,899 --> 01:41:00,250
the fucking bathroom stall crack. He heard me. Wait, let me try this one more time.

555
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:06,859
Jump off the building. No, this isn't the game's fault. I'm playing on the hardest

556
01:41:06,859 --> 01:41:12,359
difficulty in the entire game. I'm playing at rock bottom. So, we have to play rock bottom.

557
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:19,979
We have to deal with the rock bottom issue. Why did I do that? Because chat pia pressured

558
01:41:19,979 --> 01:41:35,369
me into doing something once again. Oh no, that wasn't one guy. That was like two thousand guys.

559
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:44,949
All right. Let's try this again. So, is this what is this with the I don't understand what

560
01:41:44,949 --> 01:41:51,460
this is. What is the is that everyone moves together or is that sneak? Is this there's

561
01:41:51,460 --> 01:42:00,279
only this sneak is already activated. That's like fast run. So, there is no other option

562
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:16,039
besides this. Fucking god. That's not what I wanted to do. Why did he go? Well, I would have

563
01:42:16,039 --> 01:42:25,539
walked into that guy anyways. It's for your whole squad to run together. That makes sense.

564
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:34,039
Use the ladder this time. Why? We already proved that the ladder is just a prop. It doesn't do

565
01:42:34,039 --> 01:43:07,979
anything. Can I like walk over this? I don't think I can. Six percent chance. Not gonna

566
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:13,340
get out at six percent. Why is this one so much harder than the other ones?

567
01:43:13,899 --> 01:43:21,510
You train your skills as a slave. Learn to fight. Learn to revolt. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

568
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:27,289
Everybody wants me to eat this guy and then jump over the building.

569
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:58,380
We gotta play rock bottom. Right click the ladder. No, there's no context menu there.

570
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:05,670
You must believe in the ladder. Everything you do makes you stronger. Losing and die makes you

571
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:08,630
tougher. If you keep reloading sage, you get rid of all that experience you've been learning.

572
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:20,970
Yeah, this game is about getting your ass kicked. There's another person over here.

573
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:30,949
I don't think you can go over here, but that would be pretty effective if you could.

574
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:37,779
All right. Shackles. I'm just gonna go naked. Stealth KO this guy.

575
01:44:40,649 --> 01:45:12,069
Isn't that gonna make noise? Here we go. Watch this shit. Stealth KO that guy with zero

576
01:45:12,069 --> 01:45:21,609
percent. That's not gonna work. What chance did you have? There's none. I can't hurt

577
01:45:21,609 --> 01:45:25,689
anybody. I can't fight anybody. I have to just deal with it. I've got to get out,

578
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:32,090
have to escape, and I have to find something to eat. And then I'm gonna start over as like

579
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:40,069
a man and his dog. Climb on the cage and WWE this guy. No, I'm gonna take off the shackles,

580
01:45:41,909 --> 01:45:46,310
unlock the cage, and I'm getting out of here. Once this guy goes downstairs.

581
01:45:46,869 --> 01:46:00,420
I'm trying this one more time. I am on sneak. I am being very silent. No shackles. No,

582
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:16,550
I don't have any gear on. No gear. Turk off slave. No jobs. No range. Only sneak.

583
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:29,239
This guy's just... is that guy gonna see me? I mean, he's just sitting right there.

584
01:46:46,779 --> 01:46:54,779
I can't sneak by that. Steal the gear from the back room. I've tried to twice.

585
01:46:55,579 --> 01:47:03,689
I mean, I could... I can't just run. They're faster than me. Maybe... are they gonna... is

586
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:15,260
their AI gonna go in different spots this time? It is. Okay, good. Go. All right. I made it

587
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:37,079
around the corner. I'm not moving a muscle. All right. Get me over here. Safe. Oops. All

588
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:51,319
right. Here we go. He's gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Quick. What's in the box? There's

589
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:57,859
nothing even in here. What a bait. There's nothing here. Why? What about the safe? You

590
01:47:57,859 --> 01:48:01,939
don't have any money in your safe. Okay. What about this thing? Nothing. It's empty.

591
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:10,489
Pick the lock. 77% chance. This is what I get for practicing in the cell the whole time.

592
01:48:12,729 --> 01:48:19,079
Got it. Oh, cool. There's a flip book in here. There's a notebook in here.

593
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:25,289
Wanted. Cannibal leaders. Leader of the entire known cannibal population. Actual magical

594
01:48:25,369 --> 01:48:37,770
powers unknown. Reward 40,000 C. Sure, I'll... I'll take it. What am I doing? What? What happened?

595
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:51,449
Was that an alarm? Was the book... was the book alarmed? Did the book have a tripwire on it?

596
01:48:52,090 --> 01:49:02,899
No, he dropped a bunch of frames. Yeah, we're good. We're back. It was trapped?

597
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:13,289
It was not trapped. I don't understand how it was a book. He's not gonna ever hear it,

598
01:49:13,289 --> 01:49:23,909
right? Okay, so there's nothing in any of these. There's something in here. They can hear you take

599
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:28,229
stuff. All loot is alarmed in this game. Enemies for three miles will hear you. Oh,

600
01:49:28,949 --> 01:49:32,500
it's because I was reading that out loud. Maybe I shouldn't have read that out loud.

601
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:39,100
What about in here? There's no stray weapon or food or clothes in any of this shit.

602
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:52,420
More books. They're gonna hear me take these books. Why am I Naruto running? All right,

603
01:49:52,420 --> 01:50:13,050
I can't pick up anything. I just have to get out of here. I need to get that manga.

604
01:50:13,689 --> 01:50:22,359
Now let's move this way. So here's the question. There's so many guards everywhere.

605
01:50:22,359 --> 01:50:25,880
I don't have any shackles on. I just have a pair of pants. I have no food.

606
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:34,869
People are saying so much blatantly false shit about this game. So what you're saying is,

607
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:47,300
chat's trying to fuck me over on purpose. Blatantly false shit. How do I get out of

608
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:52,859
here? I don't even know if I can get out of here. I think I just have to be a slave.

609
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:07,939
You know what I'm saying? There's no way I can get out of this. Go out the back door.

610
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:20,579
I have to go. No, that's just more blatantly false shit. I have to go this way. I have to

611
01:51:20,579 --> 01:51:30,600
somehow sneak by all these guys. This person is going to see me leave this door.

612
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,079
I think I might just have to serve my time. Yeah, I think so.

613
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:46,819
And I climb through windows. I don't think so. Look at all the guards everywhere. I can't even

614
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:51,300
pick up a book. They'll know I'm picking the book up. Wait, what's this? Turn off this light.

615
01:51:52,340 --> 01:52:05,079
Auto haul. What? These guys have to get out of the way. Not that guy, the other one.

616
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:14,460
Serve your sentence. I can't stealth knock anybody out. That guy has the

617
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:25,750
weapon up there. I have to get that guy's weapon or get him out. Why do I have one

618
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:33,050
arm? Because I picked the hardest difficulty in the game. Because I think maybe 15 people

619
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:41,479
thought it would be funny. I can try to run. I can try, but I don't think that's going to get me

620
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:52,250
very far. Where's the quickest way out of here? I got so far to run. Look at how far I have to

621
01:52:52,250 --> 01:53:17,159
go. If I just click here and do sprint. Oh fuck. Oh my god. I don't even know where I am.

622
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:24,920
No. No, there's no getting out of here. No, okay. This is fun. That was fun. We're going

623
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:31,779
to do a new game. This is what I've been on this whole time. I've been on rock bottom very hard.

624
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:36,340
Zero dollars. You've hit absolute rock bottom. You're alone. I'm naked hungry. You don't have any

625
01:53:36,340 --> 01:54:11,979
stuff. You lost an arm. No, a man and his dog. And begin. Skeleton? Should I be a hive?

626
01:54:11,979 --> 01:54:34,069
That won't make him look weird. No, there's only two. We have to have a human. I can't do

627
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:56,979
the weird hammerhead shark thing yet. So let's go. That's okay. It's you. Well, that's very funny.

628
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:20,819
Arm bulk. Legendary posture. Legendary posture.

629
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:47,670
This looks like I'm wearing one of those comedy sumo suits. All right. That's fine.

630
01:55:48,390 --> 01:56:05,100
We don't need to spend that much time. I'm just making a turtle. That's what it's going to end up

631
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:44,979
being. Let's go like right here. Oh man. I like the raised eyebrows. I'm not spending that

632
01:56:44,979 --> 01:57:19,060
much time on this one. I just want to get into the game again. Oh boy. Oh boy. It's perfect.

633
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:19,779
It's perfect.

634
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:46,680
It's Sephiroth. If they got crushed by a fucking anvil. All right. I'm happy.

635
01:57:48,119 --> 01:58:27,220
Name. I need a name. Where's the name? Anvil Roth. Anvil Roth? No. Canned. Canned Roth. There

636
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:50,380
you go. I fucking hate it. All right. What about my dog? Do I get to make my dog?

637
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:53,180
There are other characters' appearance haven't been changed. I'll show you what. Wait, wait,

638
01:58:53,180 --> 01:59:04,310
wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. I do get to make the dog. Or do I? I think I can do anything with

639
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:22,229
the dog. What's Sephiroth's, what was Sephiroth's weapon called? Didn't he have like a scythe or

640
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:45,369
something? The Masamune? I can't change this. All right. I'm ready. I start as a man and his

641
01:59:45,369 --> 02:00:04,920
dog. Here we go. Finally. I have a weapon. You've just hired your first recruit. You can

642
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:09,239
select different squad members by clicking on their icons in the squad panel. By using the number

643
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:12,119
keys or by left clicking and dragging them in the game. Yeah. Select your new recruit.

644
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:17,829
You can check your character's skill statistic by opening the stats menu from the command menu.

645
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:28,500
Okay. Yep. Everyone's got different stats. The dog is an engineer. Oh no, never mind.

646
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:35,180
All right. To perform first aid, exchange inventory items, guard, follow, and carry squad

647
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:39,180
members. Hold right click on them or on their portrait to bring up their interactions menu.

648
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:46,390
Right. Okay. So you can follow. You can follow you. Bodyguard. You can bodyguard. Okay. Bodyguard.

649
02:00:46,949 --> 02:01:02,310
That's what I want. Staying close to Kandroth and bodyguarding Kandroth. I'm ready. Where

650
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:09,960
are we going to go first? There's so much here. Uh, where are the towns? How many jobs or

651
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:21,560
anything? Play as the dog. I'm not going to play as the dog. What do I have for a weapon?

652
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:31,899
Okay. I do have first aid. I have a iron stick. Let's do some scavenging. I'm happy now. This is

653
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:47,300
I'm actually excited. You know how prepared I am for this? What's this? What's wrong? Get in.

654
02:01:52,329 --> 02:02:10,340
Oh, I just walked away. And from my first trick, I'm going to attach myself to a prisoner

655
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:31,770
pole and I'm going to escape. Welcome to the magic show. I love how I'm just like

656
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:42,729
three feet off the ground. Oh, something going on over here. Oh, something happening over here.

657
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:58,810
Just wait till I get these cuffs off and we'll go investigate. Go watch the fight.

658
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:16,060
Where the hell is it? Whoa. There's a there's an absolute battle going on over here. Come on.

659
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:34,979
This is the content. I need to see this. Get out of the cuffs. There's a there's a war going

660
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:40,199
on over there and I'm I can't go that far. I can only go as far as I can. Did I get out?

661
02:03:40,199 --> 02:04:02,069
I'm out, right? All right. Escape. Let's go quickly. Big Fred Flintstone running away.

662
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:12,229
All right. Look at this shit. Where's my friend? Come on. Hurry up. All right. I got to be ready

663
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:29,350
for this. Let's get a good view. There's some major conflict going on down here.

664
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:36,779
Holy shit. Look at this. You want to know what the plan is? It's called let them all kill

665
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:47,960
each other and then go pick up all the scraps. Where's the dog? Get over here. I just found a

666
02:04:47,960 --> 02:05:01,140
bunch of free stuff. Okay, here we go. Just be a vulture. No, they don't even care about

667
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:07,399
me. What? Why would they even give a shit that I'm here? I'm just gonna go start picking up

668
02:05:07,399 --> 02:05:11,739
stuff on people's bodies. I have nothing to do with this conflict. It's just free stuff for me.

669
02:05:12,619 --> 02:05:15,739
Oh, well. Oh, yeah. I'll take a fucking sword. That'd be nice.

670
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:22,439
Give me all your armor. Holy shit. It's like a rare. That's a rare.

671
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:39,430
I'm getting rare items. Well, thanks for the immense improvement. Can I even wear this?

672
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:51,100
Well, what's happening? Hey, I traded you all my shit. You woke up with my stuff.

673
02:05:57,529 --> 02:06:10,539
Uh-oh. Got you. You got anything else on you? No. Next person. Come on. What's wrong with my head?

674
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:30,550
Pants? Yep. Give me these big armor boots. Not the Minecraft shoes. Stealing chance. 100%.

675
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:35,130
Was it a standard grade? No, that's good. I'm gonna keep that on. Do you have any money?

676
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:44,149
This guy has some other stuff too though. What is that? Holy shit. What's that thing?

677
02:06:44,149 --> 02:06:57,880
Just take it. I don't know. Evil thief. All right. Hold. This guy's kind of hard.

678
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:16,810
Get him. Hit him with your sword. I'm gonna have to start running. Uh, can you not hit him? Get

679
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:25,479
him. Bite him. That guy has a huge cloud weapon too. This is gonna be like true Final Fantasy.

680
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:28,760
Does he look like a commander or anything? Is he? How you doing? Oh, shit. I gotta hit.

681
02:07:29,319 --> 02:07:45,930
Give the sword to the dog. That's not how this works. Swing your sword at him. No, wait.

682
02:07:48,140 --> 02:08:13,100
Why is this guy so much better than me? Can I see his health? He's almost dead. Oh my. He's

683
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:34,970
a soldier and you are a random idiot. Well, how did I take out the other soldier? Don't worry. I

684
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:39,770
might have been too heavy. All right. Well, let's just, let's get easy stuff. I'm taking

685
02:08:39,770 --> 02:09:01,270
the one person and we're getting out of here. All right. Come on. Is this too big? No. Let's

686
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:10,340
go. Let's get out of here. Out. Out, out, out, out, out, out. Get out. Okay. Wait. This

687
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:14,979
is one. There's another sword over here. Get it. And then get out. That's a cool sword.

688
02:09:14,979 --> 02:09:18,100
Take it. I don't know if this is, but take it too. I don't want those pants. Just go.

689
02:09:18,899 --> 02:09:30,630
Am I too heavy? All right. We're far enough away from the battle. Let me see what else this guy

690
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:38,470
has. I can actually take a look. Attack bonus plus six plus six damage versus animals. It's

691
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:46,180
the same weapon. Armor penetration. I need to like, I need to, I need to go safe and look

692
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:59,300
at this stuff. All right. Dog is fine. Dog just has backpack. Does not have anything else.

693
02:10:00,979 --> 02:10:14,710
All right. I'm good. Let us continue. Let's go this way. Oh no, that's the dog. Sorry.

694
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:23,350
You are on bodyguard and staying close. Good. We're both hungry. At least he is. You can

695
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:27,510
have conscious characters carry KO'd characters to safety. That's good to know.

696
02:10:28,939 --> 02:10:33,420
Carry them to a bed. The rescue job will find nearby unconscious allies and automatically

697
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:37,979
carry them to bed if there are any in the vicinity. Interesting. And disguises. If you

698
02:10:37,979 --> 02:10:41,340
have the complete outfit, you can use faction uniforms to disguise yourself.

699
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:47,029
Disguise success is dependent on the stealth skill stat. Your character status

700
02:10:47,029 --> 02:10:54,939
will show as disguised when you are hidden in full uniform. Okay. Carefully you don't get

701
02:10:54,939 --> 02:10:57,899
caught wearing a faction's uniform. Most people don't take too kindly to impostors.

702
02:10:58,859 --> 02:11:07,380
You got it. So it's time to just explore. I'm thinking we go up to the north here.

703
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:18,279
Into the cold. That sounds like a good time to me. I need to make a house. I got a lot

704
02:11:18,279 --> 02:11:33,420
of stuff to do. How many money? I got 13 cents. It says disguise blown. Somebody

705
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,539
he's seen through you. Disguise cooldown 60 seconds. We're going to be far enough away

706
02:11:36,539 --> 02:11:44,779
from those people, but it's not going to matter. Whoa. What happened over here?

707
02:11:45,579 --> 02:12:10,329
Something crawled as a person. Are you alive? Saber cutting damage 39.

708
02:12:11,050 --> 02:12:17,609
52. Blunt 0.02. Blunt. This is better. Blood loss is just better. Attack bonus minus 5

709
02:12:18,489 --> 02:12:21,850
plus 6. Indoors penalty. There's an indoors penalty on this one. Wait.

710
02:12:22,729 --> 02:12:27,449
This is much lighter. Oh fuck this thing. What about this?

711
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:45,720
Metal plate. Blunt resistance 7. 17. It's actually better. Shirt. What's this? Cut

712
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:55,180
resistance efficiency. This is armor. Yeah. It is lighter though by a lot. No it's not. Yeah

713
02:12:55,180 --> 02:13:07,380
it is. What happened to my boots? Did I just throw the boots in the ground? Where did my boots go?

714
02:13:07,939 --> 02:13:17,060
What happened to my shoes? Did I- Where did the shoes go? I didn't- Oh right. Because

715
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:21,539
it- Okay. I forgot. I didn't save it till then. Let's check this other guy.

716
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:36,359
Blood loss 6.5. 13. It's actually better. Attack bonus minus 4 though. I'm not sure

717
02:13:36,359 --> 02:13:47,479
that's better from what I have right now. More defense. Carrying too much stuff. Well,

718
02:13:47,479 --> 02:13:49,800
I'm going to get- I'm not going to use this so you can have it in your

719
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:59,029
total weight. 38 out of 15. Oh shit. Okay. No, I am too heavy. Let's see what happens if I take

720
02:13:59,029 --> 02:14:09,770
that off. 18 out of 15. 13 out of 15. That's all right. I got- That's all right. Use the

721
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:33,020
cloud sword. Armor penetration damage versus robots. 19 out of 15. Wait. What did I just-

722
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:49,800
God damn it. I mean I can't pick that up. Why can't I pick that up? That's fine.

723
02:14:50,699 --> 02:14:53,020
Uh, I can sell this stuff though. How much does it sell for?

724
02:14:54,279 --> 02:15:04,359
1700. I don't even care how much I weigh. I will slug my way to a ton. Weapon 2. No,

725
02:15:04,359 --> 02:15:08,090
it doesn't fit in that slot. All right. Well, I'm going to be- I'm very heavy, but

726
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:15,829
where- having this- just wearing it? Is it train strength? So I need just to weigh down

727
02:15:15,829 --> 02:15:19,189
on myself. Does it matter if it's in my inventory or do I have to put it on?

728
02:15:19,989 --> 02:15:35,100
Click on the name of the item. So you hold alt. Can't pick that up. Well, I'll just keep

729
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:42,550
that here for fun. So I can't really move that well, but let's go up here. So I'm going

730
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:46,630
to bang them right- actually I can just go like this, right? Yeah. So I'm going to move

731
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:51,909
very slowly, but I don't want to walk across the battlefield. I'm not going to, right?

732
02:15:51,909 --> 02:16:12,420
I mean I kind of am. Yeah. I'm untouchable right now. Don't worry. They're all fighting

733
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:19,210
over there. I just need to slowly- where's my strength? Let's see stats. Strength. 28.

734
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:29,289
28%. 29%. That's so- you actually have to strength train. I'm probably going to get

735
02:16:29,289 --> 02:16:43,829
hungry doing this, aren't I? What's that on the ground? Popcorn? Got to hit the gym.

736
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:52,340
I do have to keep an eye out for a town. Ooh. No, that's a camp. But what is that,

737
02:16:52,340 --> 02:17:11,399
though? I mean, should I investigate this? Probably not. There's nothing here. No bandits,

738
02:17:11,479 --> 02:17:22,549
no slavers anywhere. That's good. I'm okay for now. I'm just going to slowly make my way.

739
02:17:26,809 --> 02:17:46,569
Strength. This is the lamest thing. Click the building. Public. Hamlet condition. Small shack.

740
02:17:46,569 --> 02:17:57,100
Doesn't say anything. Speed up the game speed. Yeah. I'm just like kind of walking slowly.

741
02:18:05,639 --> 02:18:17,670
Okay. How close are we now? Not close at all. Can you build a car in this game? That's

742
02:18:17,670 --> 02:18:23,430
interesting looking. Let's keep going. Discovered- wait, what did I discover?

743
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:53,340
Ravaged Hamlet. This is the zone? What's my strength doing? What is that? Ravaged Hamlet,

744
02:18:53,340 --> 02:19:02,409
guard outpost, bast. There are four people that live here. 14 live in the city. This is

745
02:19:02,409 --> 02:19:19,750
just nothing out here over here. Then what is that? Hold on. I have to discover. Well,

746
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:24,979
let's just keep going. Oh, it's dark. I need to set up a camp or something. Like a campfire?

747
02:19:24,979 --> 02:19:31,700
I hear something. I hear something. I hear something. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop,

748
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:41,750
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I heard like clanging. Was it me? It might have just been me.

749
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:58,469
What's that? Is that a new squad member potentially? What is it? It's a bone dog.

750
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:10,219
Oh no. I'm gonna say this game is huge. Food. It's food. It's food. I can eat that dog.

751
02:20:12,809 --> 02:20:24,870
I'm okay though. We're not hungry. I can make it. I played for three days before I

752
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:32,459
saw a camp. Holy shit. Discovered Watchtower. Let's take a look at what it is.

753
02:20:33,799 --> 02:20:51,850
Watchtower. What do you think? Should we check it out? Let's go to the Watchtower. All right.

754
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:19,340
This does, this feels so stupid. Okay, slow it down. I want to see where we are. There's the

755
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:30,629
Watchtower. The question is, what is in the Watchtower? I see a band of, I'm not sure what.

756
02:21:30,629 --> 02:21:47,750
Are these raiders or hungry bandits? I don't want to cross their path for sure. Whoa! Go

757
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:50,950
this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go that way. Go that way. There's so many people right

758
02:21:50,950 --> 02:22:03,620
here. These are paladins. Oh wait, no, no. This is fine. Paladins are not going to attack on

759
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:25,399
sight, right? Why would they? Yeah, I'm just going to avoid them. I want to go into the

760
02:22:25,399 --> 02:22:35,000
tower over there. That's not where they're going, right? Holy Chosen. Holy Sentinel. Quiet.

761
02:22:35,559 --> 02:23:06,059
Let's go. I'll get up there. He's five times wider than he is tall. They're going a really

762
02:23:06,059 --> 02:23:19,290
weird route. I think I'm okay to run. What's my strength at now? Three. I'm doing a great

763
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:33,959
job just walking around with incredibly heavy armor. All right, we're good. Both sides. Let's

764
02:23:33,959 --> 02:24:09,479
get up there. What's in here? Arm of Okren. It's finally going to be light out. Why is

765
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:14,459
everybody freaking out? Don't, don't, don't. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't

766
02:24:14,459 --> 02:24:27,420
go in there. Don't. Why? I can, I can have a conversation with these guys. Save it. I'll

767
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:41,700
save it. Fine. Okay. Conversation. Let's talk about what we can do for each other. I've got

768
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:55,270
some supplies. If you guys have anything I can trade. There is no, like I had a chat bubble.

769
02:24:55,270 --> 02:25:11,110
Out of bounds. Get out. Who had the speech bubble? I can sleep in their beds. All right.

770
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:28,219
That's fine. Leave. Oh, all right. All right. All right. Relax. I'm leaving. There's the

771
02:25:28,219 --> 02:25:30,860
guy with the speech bubble. Why aren't you leaving your trespassing? Get out. Wait, wait,

772
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:38,100
wait, wait, wait. Talk to Paladin. Blessings from the Lord of Light, brother. Okren's light

773
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:42,780
shines brightly today. A good omen. Any travel advice? Any tips on how to live more

774
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:50,069
wholesomely for an Okrenite newbie? Greetings. Are you free to discuss the word of Narco?

775
02:25:50,069 --> 02:25:57,850
Sorry, I have to go. Any tips on how to live more wholesomely for a newbie? Study the scriptures

776
02:25:57,850 --> 02:26:03,049
of light, meditate on them, pray to Okren, and respect his holy servants with an open heart.

777
02:26:04,139 --> 02:26:10,979
Brother, this is the way to a pious existence. For darkness preys on an undisciplined mind.

778
02:26:10,979 --> 02:26:13,940
As for duty, if you are blessed with the skills for it, you may carry out

779
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:22,809
Okren's retribution directly by bringing marked heretics to the Inquisitorium. Any travel advice?

780
02:26:22,809 --> 02:26:27,129
Venturing on a pilgrimage, brother? Well, it's best to stick to holy territory. The

781
02:26:27,129 --> 02:26:31,690
Outerlands are infested with Narco's heretics that will try to deceive and tempt you into

782
02:26:31,690 --> 02:26:37,370
the darkness with them. But if you must venture further, above all else, you must avoid

783
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:43,670
traveling northwest. Only the most devilish monstrosities prowl there a hundred times

784
02:26:43,670 --> 02:26:47,750
the size of a man with the hunger of a rabid demon. Isn't that where I was planning on

785
02:26:48,069 --> 02:26:53,979
going? The foolish treasure hunters are the only travelers to delve there and never to return,

786
02:26:53,979 --> 02:26:59,079
but how tragic it is. There's nothing worth searching for. There's no place for riches

787
02:26:59,079 --> 02:27:11,139
if Okren is already in your heart. Thanks for the info. Alright. Hey, thanks. That was

788
02:27:11,139 --> 02:27:22,090
actually some pretty good info. You have any food? What did I do? I saved the game!

789
02:27:22,090 --> 02:27:36,459
They didn't like that I saved the game! What?! What are you doing?! Hey! I don't understand!

790
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:47,270
Where are we going? Why is this happening? They told you to leave so- I just had a conversation

791
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:56,940
with one of them! I was literally just talking to the guy for like 10 straight minutes

792
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:05,620
about Okren and thanks for the tips and advice. Time for me to leave. Goodbye. See you later.

793
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:57,450
Where's the dog? Uh, time- dog only. I don't understand. I- I don't get it. I was just

794
02:28:57,450 --> 02:29:17,739
having a conversation with the dude. First aid. Yes, use it. Just run. Run and don't look

795
02:29:17,739 --> 02:29:45,719
back! Get out of the cage quick! Get- pick the lock! Get out of the cage now! Alright,

796
02:29:45,719 --> 02:29:51,639
I can- dying. I gotta go quick. Quick quick quick. Get out. Get out. Out out out. Okay,

797
02:29:51,639 --> 02:30:06,540
set free. Escape. What am I- what am I- what's wrong with you? Why am I crawling? Get up!

798
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:17,989
What's wrong with my leg? Come on! What? You're there. You're not welcome here. Don't

799
02:30:17,989 --> 02:30:35,350
make me ask you twice. I can't even stand up. I was gonna fucking leave! I wasn't- I was

800
02:30:35,350 --> 02:30:46,579
talking to the guy out in front- in the front door. Like, I was standing right here having

801
02:30:46,579 --> 02:31:14,549
a conversation on the steps of their house. Alright, let's go. See, out of bounds. Get

802
02:31:14,549 --> 02:31:25,639
out. Like, but I- I- I'm gone. I'm gone. Bye. See you later. Thanks for nothing.

803
02:31:25,639 --> 02:31:29,639
Having a conversation doesn't sound like leaving. Well, so if they want me to leave

804
02:31:29,639 --> 02:31:33,079
so bad, why would that guy have a full conversation about like the Lord of Light with

805
02:31:33,799 --> 02:31:45,139
Get out of here, you piece of shit! You're a scumbag!

806
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:49,219
Hey, uh, so the Lord of Light- uh, let me give you some tips first, Bob, by the way.

807
02:31:49,219 --> 02:31:53,299
So go- if you go- don't go to the Northwest. There's some scary guys up there. Be careful.

808
02:31:53,299 --> 02:31:56,899
Oh, if you want to- one other tip. Uh, make sure you have enough supplies and-

809
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:59,700
Kill him! Murder him and his dog!

810
02:32:11,899 --> 02:32:16,299
You sounded like a YouTuber there. Alright, where am I going? Where am I allowed to be?

811
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:27,059
Okay, here's the actual town. We're going to the actual city. It's right there.

812
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:37,799
I have too much armor. Yeah, but I'm building up strength. The YouTuber voice.

813
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:53,850
There's shit going on over there. Maybe I- they told me not to go up here,

814
02:32:55,159 --> 02:32:57,879
but that kind of makes me want to go up here. Because

815
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:02,620
maybe they're just liars. It's a dog. Come on.

816
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:08,659
Oh, we gotta match speeds here, man. I'm like losing the dog.

817
02:33:09,459 --> 02:33:31,299
Come on. Get over here. Quickly. We have to stick together.

818
02:33:32,020 --> 02:33:43,190
There we go. You're gonna have 20 people in your squad.

819
02:33:43,909 --> 02:33:47,030
That's actually insane. Maybe I should just make a camp or something.

820
02:33:48,149 --> 02:33:53,059
What do you need for materials? To run your own camp.

821
02:33:53,059 --> 02:34:03,799
The dog is the only smart one here. Okay. I'm gonna build a house over here.

822
02:34:13,639 --> 02:34:16,120
There's so much to explore. I don't even know where to go.

823
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:18,280
I don't know what to do. I'm so overwhelmed.

824
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,159
I'm just gonna go this way, I guess, until I find another town?

825
02:34:21,879 --> 02:34:30,620
Wait, hold on. Now, these are holy servants. We're fine.

826
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:39,379
How's my strength? Minus two? For what? Because I'm hungry.

827
02:34:39,459 --> 02:34:49,610
Don't have any food on me. Just build a house. I can't. I need materials.

828
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:52,090
Are these holy? Holy servants. Yeah.

829
02:34:55,430 --> 02:34:57,030
Southwest is a good starter area.

830
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:59,989
Well, that's gonna take me a long time to get there.

831
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:08,790
Okay, hold on. Should I just bang a U-turn and go down here?

832
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:17,270
I'm gonna go down here. Hey, hey, you're going too fast.

833
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:25,750
Going too fast. Stay with me. These guys hostile than not, right?

834
02:35:42,389 --> 02:35:44,549
All right. Any huts? Any...

835
02:35:44,549 --> 02:35:46,709
Okay, there is a congregation over here.

836
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:49,700
Discovered farm ruins.

837
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:54,420
There better be steaks and sodas and shit, like canned meat and stuff.

838
02:35:59,190 --> 02:36:00,790
And this is taking me up.

839
02:36:06,809 --> 02:36:08,329
See if we can find anything in the ruins.

840
02:36:08,969 --> 02:36:16,459
All right. I don't see anything over here.

841
02:36:17,020 --> 02:36:18,680
This looks fairly safe.

842
02:36:19,399 --> 02:36:24,090
Is this a campfire? There's a fresh campfire here.

843
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:38,180
But that means there probably are supplies somewhere.

844
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:45,819
Hold alt? I am. I'm holding alt right now.

845
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:53,700
Nothing at this fresh campsite?

846
02:36:54,260 --> 02:37:05,459
How can there be nothing at a fresh campsite?

847
02:37:05,459 --> 02:37:13,000
What am I looting?

848
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,040
No, I don't have any meat in here.

849
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:34,069
Okay, that's a nice nap.

850
02:37:34,709 --> 02:37:39,620
No, nothing else in these ruins.

851
02:37:43,479 --> 02:37:44,920
Wait, is that like a... what's that?

852
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:47,239
Nothing.

853
02:37:47,239 --> 02:37:48,729
Well, that sucks.

854
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:51,450
How can there be nothing in here?

855
02:37:53,989 --> 02:37:55,670
Hold up, traveler.

856
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:57,110
Speak with me. Speak... whoa, whoa, whoa.

857
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:57,670
Speak with me.

858
02:37:58,309 --> 02:38:03,959
Hello.

859
02:38:03,959 --> 02:38:05,000
Love and devotion, brother.

860
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,120
Welcome to your motherland.

861
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:09,000
The sacred domain of the holy Lord Phoenix himself.

862
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,040
Blessed be his name.

863
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:12,920
Evil lurks in all shadows of the land.

864
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,920
But Okren watches over you here, brother.

865
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:17,799
Where you belong as a pure blood.

866
02:38:17,799 --> 02:38:19,239
Okay, thanks.

867
02:38:19,239 --> 02:38:20,040
Blessings on you.

868
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:21,159
I guess you want...

869
02:38:21,159 --> 02:38:22,680
Blessings... I'm going to play the part here

870
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:24,120
because I'm wearing their uniform.

871
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,799
Blessings upon you, brother.

872
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:28,360
It's easy to find danger and lose your path

873
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:30,360
when you journey away from the holy cities, my brother.

874
02:38:31,079 --> 02:38:32,760
Remember to stay true to your purity

875
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:35,159
and take refuge in the holy Lord Phoenix himself.

876
02:38:35,159 --> 02:38:36,200
Blessed be his name.

877
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:36,700
I agree.

878
02:38:37,879 --> 02:38:39,719
Now you look starved half to death.

879
02:38:39,799 --> 02:38:40,440
Here, take this.

880
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:41,959
You need these rations more than I do.

881
02:38:41,959 --> 02:38:42,840
Be well, brother.

882
02:38:44,459 --> 02:38:45,340
Thank you so much.

883
02:38:46,579 --> 02:38:49,989
Hey, take a look at this.

884
02:38:49,989 --> 02:38:51,030
Rations. Food pack.

885
02:38:55,180 --> 02:39:00,149
So this is free stuff.

886
02:39:02,149 --> 02:39:02,790
Ingredients.

887
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:04,389
Food cube. Dried meat.

888
02:39:05,819 --> 02:39:07,500
So I need to eat this right now.

889
02:39:08,219 --> 02:39:09,610
How do we split it?

890
02:39:10,329 --> 02:39:14,909
Pick up.

891
02:39:16,629 --> 02:39:17,350
No, no, no, no, no.

892
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:18,149
Put the dog down.

893
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,959
Put the dog down.

894
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:25,159
Why is he carrying it like this?

895
02:39:25,159 --> 02:39:26,680
How do I put the dog down?

896
02:39:28,299 --> 02:39:31,319
Okay. Jesus.

897
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:35,020
They eat, you eat automatically.

898
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:37,159
You do?

899
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:43,500
You just eat it automatically.

900
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:44,219
Oh, okay.

901
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:47,389
All right.

902
02:39:47,850 --> 02:39:50,840
Oh, you do.

903
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:51,319
All right.

904
02:39:51,319 --> 02:39:51,819
Okay.

905
02:39:53,299 --> 02:39:53,799
Nice.

906
02:39:55,379 --> 02:39:56,420
First victory of the night

907
02:39:56,420 --> 02:40:00,180
and it only took two hours and 41 minutes to find food

908
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:01,139
and I didn't even find it.

909
02:40:01,139 --> 02:40:02,020
Somebody gave it to me.

910
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:04,340
Somebody entered my Dark Souls game

911
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:06,659
and dropped like 20 humanities on the ground

912
02:40:07,219 --> 02:40:09,059
and then waved and fucking disconnected.

913
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:11,059
Hey, thanks.

914
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:16,299
I appreciate it.

915
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:23,670
Right. Let's see if there's anything here.

916
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:24,870
Let's zoom in on the map a little.

917
02:40:24,870 --> 02:40:26,309
I want to see if there's any towns, man.

918
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:32,069
Farm ruins.

919
02:40:32,069 --> 02:40:32,790
There's nothing there.

920
02:40:36,680 --> 02:40:38,920
I was told not to go this way because it's dangerous

921
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:43,139
so I'm going to go this way.

922
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:45,979
We'll go around and down.

923
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:47,899
Well, once we hit the lake we're going to go down here

924
02:40:47,899 --> 02:40:49,659
so let's just make our way this way.

925
02:40:50,459 --> 02:40:57,780
I'm still in Paladin territory, I believe.

926
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:02,680
So feed your dog.

927
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:05,319
The dog eats at the same time as you, right?

928
02:41:05,959 --> 02:41:07,979
Are we not sharing this food?

929
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:09,899
No, we're not sharing the food.

930
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:13,159
Wait, why?

931
02:41:13,959 --> 02:41:20,379
I got to put the food in the dog's inventory.

932
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:26,840
How do I keep them both open at the same time?

933
02:41:27,399 --> 02:41:36,309
The dog can't eat from your inventory.

934
02:41:36,309 --> 02:41:38,469
You have to drop it on the floor and put it

935
02:41:38,469 --> 02:41:40,229
or put it in your backpack which you don't have.

936
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:56,739
Okay.

937
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:07,770
What happened?

938
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:09,049
Who ate the ration pack?

939
02:42:14,329 --> 02:42:15,290
He ate it.

940
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:17,129
Well, why is he still at 130?

941
02:42:17,690 --> 02:42:33,799
He ate the whole pack.

942
02:42:33,799 --> 02:42:34,520
He ate the...

943
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:35,959
You ate all of our rations.

944
02:42:35,959 --> 02:42:36,920
That's all we had.

945
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:38,840
What?

946
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:45,139
Of course, you can't like leave food on the ground, guys.

947
02:42:47,479 --> 02:42:49,239
Yeah, just take like 20 sandwiches

948
02:42:49,239 --> 02:42:50,360
and put them down on the floor

949
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:52,280
and your dog will just eat one of them.

950
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:57,860
This is the way I wanted to go.

951
02:42:57,860 --> 02:42:59,459
No, I wanted to wrap around here.

952
02:42:59,459 --> 02:43:09,129
All right, we're fine.

953
02:43:13,459 --> 02:43:15,299
I wanted to go around this way

954
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:17,959
so I kind of went the wrong way.

955
02:43:20,889 --> 02:43:22,649
Dog equals food.

956
02:43:22,649 --> 02:43:23,850
No, that's not going to happen.

957
02:43:23,850 --> 02:43:24,809
I'm not going to eat the dog.

958
02:43:25,690 --> 02:43:28,709
You probably can't even eat the dog.

959
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:35,719
Something over there.

960
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,399
What's that?

961
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:39,690
Distraction.

962
02:43:39,690 --> 02:43:40,090
Let's see.

963
02:43:44,579 --> 02:43:45,219
Dog?

964
02:43:45,219 --> 02:43:47,770
What are you doing?

965
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:52,920
What's wrong with it?

966
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,120
Oh, okay, you got stuck.

967
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:57,399
All right, let's take a look.

968
02:43:58,969 --> 02:44:00,569
Holding alt, looking around,

969
02:44:00,569 --> 02:44:01,690
seeing if I can find the items

970
02:44:02,409 --> 02:44:04,250
in this broken down house.

971
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:07,899
Oh, perma jobs.

972
02:44:10,100 --> 02:44:11,219
You can organize your squad

973
02:44:11,219 --> 02:44:13,139
by assigning them jobs in the orders menu.

974
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:16,700
It's especially useful for farms, mines,

975
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:18,379
and other production jobs

976
02:44:18,379 --> 02:44:20,059
since assigned characters will automatically store

977
02:44:20,059 --> 02:44:21,739
and replenish raw materials as they work.

978
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:23,559
Okay.

979
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:26,840
Well, it's the holy servants.

980
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:28,600
To assign a job, select a character,

981
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:30,360
then hold shift while clicking

982
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:31,559
to interact with the object

983
02:44:31,559 --> 02:44:33,000
or building you wish to assign them to.

984
02:44:33,879 --> 02:44:40,459
Okay, hold shift while right clicking

985
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:41,899
and on an object.

986
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:45,129
Then you can assign a job.

987
02:44:45,930 --> 02:44:49,159
You can give characters multiple jobs.

988
02:44:49,159 --> 02:44:51,159
Top most jobs in the orders menu

989
02:44:51,159 --> 02:44:52,600
will always take priority.

990
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,870
Okay.

991
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:57,180
You can remove a job at any time

992
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,299
by pressing it on the X.

993
02:44:58,299 --> 02:44:59,979
So why did it tell me?

994
02:45:03,159 --> 02:45:03,959
Really?

995
02:45:03,959 --> 02:45:05,739
Can you do this?

996
02:45:06,299 --> 02:45:12,950
What am I getting from this?

997
02:45:13,829 --> 02:45:21,159
Am I going to get materials?

998
02:45:27,379 --> 02:45:28,819
Do I have a progress bar?

999
02:45:33,459 --> 02:45:34,659
I'm being a real dwarf.

1000
02:45:38,889 --> 02:45:41,049
Is this completely futile?

1001
02:45:41,610 --> 02:45:45,479
I'll just show this left click on the thing.

1002
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:47,260
Output.

1003
02:45:48,219 --> 02:45:48,540
Copper.

1004
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:52,139
Proper quality.

1005
02:45:52,139 --> 02:45:52,459
20.

1006
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:56,739
Workers, zero out of two.

1007
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:01,780
This is the progress bar?

1008
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:19,399
I'm not mining them.

1009
02:46:19,399 --> 02:46:20,520
I'm mining something else.

1010
02:46:24,809 --> 02:46:26,809
Okay, that's the one.

1011
02:46:30,969 --> 02:46:33,290
I'm going to build a house right here.

1012
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:36,200
I'm going to build a fire.

1013
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:36,920
I'm going to build a house.

1014
02:46:37,639 --> 02:46:42,340
You are so stupid.

1015
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:44,899
My two-year-old sister has a higher IQ.

1016
02:46:44,899 --> 02:46:45,139
What?

1017
02:46:45,139 --> 02:46:46,819
Because I didn't know which...

1018
02:46:47,379 --> 02:46:48,659
What do you mean copper?

1019
02:46:49,219 --> 02:46:51,430
How was I supposed to know?

1020
02:46:51,430 --> 02:46:53,510
Like they're all the same thing.

1021
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:56,219
Look at this.

1022
02:46:56,219 --> 02:46:57,819
Like I don't even know which one

1023
02:46:57,819 --> 02:46:58,780
I'm standing in front of.

1024
02:47:00,809 --> 02:47:02,569
It's apparently this one here.

1025
02:47:02,569 --> 02:47:03,290
I'm here.

1026
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:03,930
It's over here.

1027
02:47:04,569 --> 02:47:12,409
All right.

1028
02:47:12,409 --> 02:47:13,770
You need to like patrol or something.

1029
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:18,979
Mine with the dog?

1030
02:47:18,979 --> 02:47:19,299
I can't.

1031
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:22,340
He doesn't have opposable thumbs.

1032
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:22,899
He can't do it.

1033
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:27,979
Oh no, he's got the zombies.

1034
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:30,540
Did I get something?

1035
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:38,040
Why did I stop?

1036
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:49,239
I'm doing fine.

1037
02:47:57,020 --> 02:47:58,299
I kind of have to get this, right?

1038
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:10,459
Yeah, this is like the point of the game.

1039
02:48:12,709 --> 02:48:14,950
You just are a piece of shit.

1040
02:48:14,950 --> 02:48:16,309
You can't do anything.

1041
02:48:16,309 --> 02:48:34,579
You should find a town before mining.

1042
02:48:34,579 --> 02:48:36,340
Well, I almost have one copper bar

1043
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:38,260
that I'm going to get ripped off of my person.

1044
02:48:38,979 --> 02:48:47,670
It's taking me almost a full day.

1045
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:48,069
Come on.

1046
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:55,059
Paladins were fine.

1047
02:48:55,059 --> 02:49:00,940
Which one is this again?

1048
02:49:01,940 --> 02:49:02,340
Copper.

1049
02:49:02,340 --> 02:49:02,659
Got it.

1050
02:49:04,090 --> 02:49:05,129
Average price, 100.

1051
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:06,940
Thank you.

1052
02:49:07,739 --> 02:49:09,340
Yep.

1053
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:11,340
Valuable metal used in high-tech machinery.

1054
02:49:11,979 --> 02:49:19,030
Get another one.

1055
02:49:19,030 --> 02:49:19,829
Mercenary plate?

1056
02:49:19,829 --> 02:49:20,549
Where did I get this?

1057
02:49:21,829 --> 02:49:22,870
Oh, right.

1058
02:49:22,870 --> 02:49:25,500
That was so pointless.

1059
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:27,239
No, there's...

1060
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:29,399
I'm going to get three.

1061
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:30,280
Okay.

1062
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:37,610
There's no room?

1063
02:49:38,329 --> 02:49:39,209
I can move.

1064
02:49:39,209 --> 02:49:40,809
I'm a Diablo II veteran, guys.

1065
02:49:41,610 --> 02:49:42,649
I'll make room.

1066
02:49:42,649 --> 02:49:53,690
You say no more room.

1067
02:49:53,690 --> 02:50:13,290
Where is...

1068
02:50:16,409 --> 02:50:17,850
Stalling streamer.

1069
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:18,569
This is part...

1070
02:50:18,569 --> 02:50:19,770
I have to do this shit.

1071
02:50:20,170 --> 02:50:22,090
It's not like I'm just going to skip this.

1072
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:26,360
Let's take a look at the mining level.

1073
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:32,149
All right.

1074
02:50:32,149 --> 02:50:35,750
We got combat range, thievery, sciences, trades.

1075
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,500
Is it even on here?

1076
02:50:40,870 --> 02:50:44,760
Field medic, laboring, laboring.

1077
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:45,000
Okay.

1078
02:50:49,909 --> 02:50:50,870
Laboring nine.

1079
02:50:50,870 --> 02:50:51,670
I'm very good.

1080
02:50:52,739 --> 02:50:55,700
Scale of general manual labor such as mining

1081
02:50:55,700 --> 02:50:57,139
and using simple machinery.

1082
02:51:02,579 --> 02:51:03,219
Level 10.

1083
02:51:03,219 --> 02:51:03,620
Coming up.

1084
02:51:04,709 --> 02:51:05,510
Ways to train.

1085
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:06,149
Work hard.

1086
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:20,299
I'm making up for all the slave work that I did not do.

1087
02:51:27,989 --> 02:51:30,389
If I get this game, I can start the game as a slave

1088
02:51:30,389 --> 02:51:31,510
and work my way to freedom.

1089
02:51:31,510 --> 02:51:31,750
Yes.

1090
02:51:33,750 --> 02:51:35,989
You're not supposed to do anything good in this game.

1091
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:39,270
You're supposed to be a aunt of a person.

1092
02:51:44,120 --> 02:51:45,239
And not only am I doing this,

1093
02:51:45,239 --> 02:51:51,819
I'm doing this with full armor on.

1094
02:51:51,819 --> 02:51:53,180
Did I say this joke sucks?

1095
02:51:56,809 --> 02:51:58,059
What joke?

1096
02:51:58,059 --> 02:51:58,860
This is the game.

1097
02:51:58,860 --> 02:51:59,819
This is the stream, man.

1098
02:51:59,819 --> 02:52:02,780
We're fucking mining for copper bars.

1099
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:06,420
All right.

1100
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:07,299
How close am I?

1101
02:52:11,290 --> 02:52:11,690
Got one.

1102
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:12,920
All right.

1103
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:13,399
One more.

1104
02:52:15,690 --> 02:52:16,969
I can get rid of this hat.

1105
02:52:16,969 --> 02:52:17,610
I don't need this.

1106
02:52:18,329 --> 02:52:20,090
Value 10 cents.

1107
02:52:20,090 --> 02:52:20,569
No thanks.

1108
02:52:21,370 --> 02:52:23,510
These things are like 180 bucks.

1109
02:52:41,450 --> 02:52:42,170
Please stop.

1110
02:52:42,170 --> 02:52:43,290
This is not a bit.

1111
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:46,010
I'm mining for materials.

1112
02:52:46,010 --> 02:52:47,450
I need the materials.

1113
02:52:49,909 --> 02:52:51,590
I'm not doing like a look at how long

1114
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:52,629
I've been sitting here for.

1115
02:52:52,629 --> 02:52:54,309
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

1116
02:52:55,129 --> 02:52:58,969
No, I'm trying to get three copper bars

1117
02:52:58,969 --> 02:53:02,010
so I can use them how they're intended.

1118
02:53:02,010 --> 02:53:03,530
To smash somebody over the head with them

1119
02:53:03,530 --> 02:53:04,649
because they're just big rocks

1120
02:53:04,649 --> 02:53:05,850
and then throw them in the trash.

1121
02:53:06,649 --> 02:53:13,000
Okay, we're done.

1122
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:14,229
That's it.

1123
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:17,030
I got what I wanted.

1124
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:19,110
I got three dinosaur eggs.

1125
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:20,389
My three dragons.

1126
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:50,120
They're going to net you 10 copper.

1127
02:53:51,319 --> 02:53:52,440
No, look at the price.

1128
02:53:53,239 --> 02:53:55,879
194 cents.

1129
02:53:55,879 --> 02:54:02,780
The cave up here.

1130
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:18,940
Put a face cam on to replace world's end.

1131
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:20,299
Go south, not north.

1132
02:54:20,299 --> 02:54:22,920
I beg you.

1133
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:25,159
Stop acting like an idiot.

1134
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:25,559
All right.

1135
02:54:25,559 --> 02:54:29,719
Look, I want to make this really clear.

1136
02:54:29,719 --> 02:54:32,120
I don't know what's up here.

1137
02:54:32,979 --> 02:54:36,360
If you do, I don't have that information.

1138
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:38,440
How would I have that information?

1139
02:54:40,100 --> 02:54:44,250
Because I'm going this way.

1140
02:54:44,250 --> 02:54:45,209
No, go this way.

1141
02:54:45,209 --> 02:54:47,850
I know what's down here.

1142
02:54:47,850 --> 02:54:48,489
I don't what?

1143
02:54:51,909 --> 02:54:54,549
I know that there's like evil demons up here

1144
02:54:54,549 --> 02:54:56,629
but like I can't go this way.

1145
02:55:00,229 --> 02:55:02,629
Why can't I go like over here?

1146
02:55:02,629 --> 02:55:04,069
I have to go down here.

1147
02:55:04,069 --> 02:55:05,030
Why can't I go over here?

1148
02:55:12,069 --> 02:55:13,989
They told me not to go up this way

1149
02:55:13,989 --> 02:55:15,590
but like I'm not going this way.

1150
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:16,790
I'm going like this way.

1151
02:55:17,430 --> 02:55:19,030
I'm going from here to here.

1152
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:28,059
You know what I mean?

1153
02:55:28,059 --> 02:55:29,659
Like I'm not like going up.

1154
02:55:29,659 --> 02:55:34,069
I'm going like down there.

1155
02:55:34,069 --> 02:55:35,030
That's the plan.

1156
02:55:40,790 --> 02:55:42,790
But I want it to like wrap around here though.

1157
02:55:42,790 --> 02:55:45,290
I want to like go this way

1158
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:46,329
because there's a lake here.

1159
02:55:46,329 --> 02:55:47,530
There's like a river and shit.

1160
02:55:47,530 --> 02:55:48,409
I want to see what this is.

1161
02:55:53,459 --> 02:55:55,379
Look, I understand this is one of those games

1162
02:55:55,379 --> 02:56:00,500
where like there's no way I could know what anything is.

1163
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:02,659
And if I'm going to stumble upon something fucking weird

1164
02:56:02,659 --> 02:56:03,780
that's what's going to happen.

1165
02:56:03,780 --> 02:56:06,020
I don't need to know like exactly where to go.

1166
02:56:06,819 --> 02:56:10,200
There's no information in the game

1167
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:11,639
besides like when people tell you.

1168
02:56:11,639 --> 02:56:12,200
You know what I mean?

1169
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:17,559
Look, his world's end.

1170
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:19,159
I want to see what this is.

1171
02:56:19,799 --> 02:56:39,989
He doesn't know where everything is

1172
02:56:40,709 --> 02:56:43,909
because there's the guard post, right?

1173
02:56:51,750 --> 02:56:53,829
Pick up the dog and carry the dog.

1174
02:56:54,389 --> 02:57:01,979
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1175
02:57:01,979 --> 02:57:03,899
No, he's a holy servant.

1176
02:57:03,899 --> 02:57:04,700
That's fine.

1177
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:14,409
All right, hold on.

1178
02:57:14,409 --> 02:57:15,530
So what is this?

1179
02:57:16,809 --> 02:57:17,770
This is all the way up here?

1180
02:57:18,329 --> 02:57:27,100
Am I going to scale this whole mountain?

1181
02:57:27,659 --> 02:57:29,319
Oh, hold on.

1182
02:57:29,319 --> 02:57:31,129
Important.

1183
02:57:31,129 --> 02:57:47,940
This is not going to take as long.

1184
02:57:47,940 --> 02:57:58,819
Put your face cam over the character's face.

1185
02:57:58,819 --> 02:58:15,879
I don't know.

1186
02:58:15,879 --> 02:58:16,280
Hold on.

1187
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:17,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1188
02:58:17,399 --> 02:58:18,600
I can't even bring it back now.

1189
02:58:19,079 --> 02:58:21,690
My hands are off.

1190
02:58:21,690 --> 02:58:22,889
I can't even do anything.

1191
02:58:22,889 --> 02:58:31,399
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me.

1192
02:58:31,399 --> 02:58:31,719
Really?

1193
02:58:35,979 --> 02:58:37,420
I'm all the way like the edge of the map.

1194
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:38,459
I can't even move.

1195
02:58:38,459 --> 02:58:48,569
Got it.

1196
02:58:48,569 --> 02:58:49,129
Okay.

1197
02:58:49,129 --> 02:58:52,180
Where was I running?

1198
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:54,819
Did I get the material?

1199
02:58:54,819 --> 02:58:55,459
Oh, fuck.

1200
02:58:55,459 --> 02:58:56,979
I don't have any room for this shit.

1201
02:58:56,979 --> 02:58:57,620
All right, hold on.

1202
02:59:17,959 --> 02:59:18,600
There.

1203
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:19,319
Better?

1204
02:59:19,319 --> 02:59:19,879
Are we good?

1205
02:59:30,629 --> 02:59:31,909
Why is that so funny?

1206
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:46,680
I don't have enough inventory space for this shit.

1207
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:47,399
Hold on.

1208
02:59:47,399 --> 02:59:48,600
What can I do with this?

1209
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:51,989
I can move this over here.

1210
02:59:51,989 --> 02:59:52,309
Hold on.

1211
02:59:52,309 --> 02:59:57,780
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1212
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,659
They stack.

1213
02:59:58,659 --> 03:00:05,020
No, they don't.

1214
03:00:05,020 --> 03:00:05,340
Fuck.

1215
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,139
Okay.

1216
03:00:06,139 --> 03:00:09,850
Just scared the shit out of me.

1217
03:00:12,579 --> 03:00:13,620
I can't carry this anymore.

1218
03:00:14,659 --> 03:00:15,459
How much is this worth?

1219
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:16,899
32.

1220
03:00:16,899 --> 03:00:17,219
No.

1221
03:00:17,219 --> 03:00:18,420
Why would I just...

1222
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:19,639
What happened?

1223
03:00:19,639 --> 03:00:22,090
Okay.

1224
03:00:22,090 --> 03:00:23,530
This is worth a lot.

1225
03:00:23,530 --> 03:00:24,680
That's worth 1,000...

1226
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:25,719
That's worth 1,700.

1227
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:34,100
Backpack?

1228
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:35,139
I don't have a backpack though.

1229
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:41,030
Like, I don't have a backpack.

1230
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:42,229
I can't put anything in my backpack.

1231
03:00:42,229 --> 03:00:43,270
I don't have one.

1232
03:00:43,270 --> 03:00:45,290
The dog inventory.

1233
03:00:45,290 --> 03:00:46,329
I don't think he can carry them.

1234
03:00:46,969 --> 03:00:59,690
What can the dog have on his back?

1235
03:00:59,690 --> 03:01:02,360
The dog is dying.

1236
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:03,159
Feed the dog.

1237
03:01:05,799 --> 03:01:08,040
I don't have any food to feed the dog.

1238
03:01:09,180 --> 03:01:10,299
Oh, shit.

1239
03:01:10,299 --> 03:01:10,860
Okay, hold on.

1240
03:01:10,860 --> 03:01:12,620
I gotta get one more fucking rock.

1241
03:01:13,260 --> 03:01:17,209
All right, let's go.

1242
03:01:24,299 --> 03:01:25,260
Where the hell?

1243
03:01:26,649 --> 03:01:27,930
This is so far away.

1244
03:01:28,489 --> 03:01:30,040
Do I have any...

1245
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:30,840
Can I eat anything?

1246
03:01:31,479 --> 03:01:35,129
I spent all the time mining and not getting any food.

1247
03:01:38,069 --> 03:01:39,430
There is a town up here.

1248
03:01:39,430 --> 03:01:40,309
Let's go.

1249
03:01:40,309 --> 03:01:40,709
Quickly.

1250
03:01:55,459 --> 03:01:57,139
Come on, we're gonna get you some food, dog.

1251
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:05,239
You're okay, you're all right.

1252
03:02:05,239 --> 03:02:06,200
You're gonna be fine.

1253
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:08,700
I just gotta get you up here.

1254
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:20,090
Go on.

1255
03:02:20,090 --> 03:02:33,510
What was that?

1256
03:02:33,510 --> 03:02:34,950
I just saw something on the screen.

1257
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:40,059
Put a picture of Otto in the dog portrait.

1258
03:02:40,059 --> 03:02:41,739
No, because if this dog dies, I'm gonna be sad

1259
03:02:41,739 --> 03:02:42,860
because it was supposed to be Otto.

1260
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:43,420
No.

1261
03:02:43,420 --> 03:02:57,739
I feel like I'm losing my grip on the dog.

1262
03:02:57,739 --> 03:03:00,459
I need to eat too.

1263
03:03:00,459 --> 03:03:02,440
Bad.

1264
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:03,559
There is a town up here.

1265
03:03:05,379 --> 03:03:06,739
Somewhere up here.

1266
03:03:06,739 --> 03:03:21,719
Don't tell me I have to scale the entire mountain.

1267
03:03:21,719 --> 03:03:23,719
How high up is this place?

1268
03:03:23,719 --> 03:03:25,000
I'm at almost zero.

1269
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,040
I'm gonna pass out.

1270
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:40,729
Should I throw off the armor?

1271
03:03:40,729 --> 03:03:49,510
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1272
03:03:49,510 --> 03:03:50,309
I'm almost there.

1273
03:03:50,309 --> 03:03:56,520
I'm almost at the front door.

1274
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:59,159
61, 98, we're good.

1275
03:03:59,159 --> 03:04:06,280
Just get me up there.

1276
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:07,159
Throw away armor.

1277
03:04:07,159 --> 03:04:08,520
I'm right there.

1278
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:09,079
Look at this.

1279
03:04:09,079 --> 03:04:10,840
I'm standing in front of the gates.

1280
03:04:18,409 --> 03:04:19,850
The weight is doubling your hunger rate.

1281
03:04:19,850 --> 03:04:20,569
But that's all right though.

1282
03:04:20,569 --> 03:04:22,170
It's giving me extra power, extra points.

1283
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:25,700
I am persevering through this shit

1284
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:27,379
and it's gonna give me more points in the long run.

1285
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:28,579
Here we go.

1286
03:04:29,219 --> 03:04:33,930
All right, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it.

1287
03:04:33,930 --> 03:04:35,049
These are tech hunters.

1288
03:04:36,389 --> 03:04:36,790
Okay.

1289
03:04:37,350 --> 03:04:39,270
Look, I got a fucking sick dog here.

1290
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:45,959
Okay, what can I save it

1291
03:04:45,959 --> 03:04:47,239
just in case something horrible happens?

1292
03:04:56,010 --> 03:04:56,649
Anybody?

1293
03:04:56,649 --> 03:04:57,530
I can just come in here?

1294
03:04:57,530 --> 03:04:58,729
Okay, they're not gonna like

1295
03:04:58,729 --> 03:05:00,250
throw me in a dungeon or anything, right?

1296
03:05:03,049 --> 03:05:03,450
Perfect.

1297
03:05:03,450 --> 03:05:03,770
Got it.

1298
03:05:03,770 --> 03:05:04,329
Okay, quick.

1299
03:05:06,139 --> 03:05:06,459
Food.

1300
03:05:07,829 --> 03:05:08,149
Shop.

1301
03:05:08,870 --> 03:05:10,069
Because that's a men's room.

1302
03:05:10,069 --> 03:05:11,350
I don't have to go to the bathroom or anything.

1303
03:05:11,350 --> 03:05:11,590
Bar.

1304
03:05:19,659 --> 03:05:20,620
Okay, let's get in here.

1305
03:05:23,899 --> 03:05:25,340
Sell the armor to this guy.

1306
03:05:25,979 --> 03:05:33,000
Okay.

1307
03:05:36,809 --> 03:05:37,209
Talk to.

1308
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:39,139
Let's trade.

1309
03:05:43,110 --> 03:05:43,989
Metal plate.

1310
03:05:43,989 --> 03:05:44,469
Here it is.

1311
03:05:45,750 --> 03:05:48,549
Value, it's 17.85.

1312
03:05:49,270 --> 03:05:51,829
I'm gonna get 4.46 for it.

1313
03:05:51,829 --> 03:05:59,829
Where's my money?

1314
03:05:59,829 --> 03:06:04,860
How do I sell it to him?

1315
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,180
Got it.

1316
03:06:05,180 --> 03:06:05,979
Okay, how much money?

1317
03:06:07,299 --> 03:06:10,170
Okay, how much are these?

1318
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:11,770
You're gonna give me 97, 97.

1319
03:06:11,930 --> 03:06:13,370
I mean, I gotta get food and shit, man.

1320
03:06:15,659 --> 03:06:16,860
I can't just not have food.

1321
03:06:17,850 --> 03:06:18,649
We gotta sell it all.

1322
03:06:21,559 --> 03:06:22,120
I need money.

1323
03:06:27,020 --> 03:06:28,940
And take this fucking dumb weapon too.

1324
03:06:31,290 --> 03:06:32,250
Maybe I should sell this.

1325
03:06:34,489 --> 03:06:35,370
What do you think?

1326
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:39,110
I think I'm gonna sell the armor as well.

1327
03:06:41,739 --> 03:06:43,260
But I need food first.

1328
03:06:44,229 --> 03:06:44,950
Dog needs it now.

1329
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:45,350
Let's go.

1330
03:06:46,069 --> 03:06:59,879
Okay, I need, I need like a general store.

1331
03:06:59,879 --> 03:07:00,600
All right, the bar.

1332
03:07:03,420 --> 03:07:05,020
This is so brutal.

1333
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:15,930
I don't, the dog's up.

1334
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:16,569
The dog is up.

1335
03:07:16,569 --> 03:07:17,290
The dog is okay.

1336
03:07:17,770 --> 03:07:20,020
I'm only unconscious for 15 seconds.

1337
03:07:20,020 --> 03:07:27,260
All right, come on.

1338
03:07:27,260 --> 03:07:31,639
Come on, just crawl to the bar and buy a fucking pretzel.

1339
03:07:33,219 --> 03:07:34,659
Go, go, go.

1340
03:07:34,659 --> 03:07:41,049
Get in here.

1341
03:07:41,049 --> 03:07:42,649
What in the name of God?

1342
03:07:42,649 --> 03:07:43,209
What happened?

1343
03:07:43,770 --> 03:07:47,530
I just clicked a fucking ad on a webpage.

1344
03:07:48,090 --> 03:07:49,190
All right, I need a bar.

1345
03:07:49,750 --> 03:07:51,829
Bartender, hello?

1346
03:07:57,530 --> 03:07:59,370
Where is, I'm just stealing it.

1347
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:02,180
All right.

1348
03:08:02,180 --> 03:08:05,479
Yeah, hey, heading out of town looking to join up.

1349
03:08:05,479 --> 03:08:08,389
Yeah, it'll be 3,000 cats.

1350
03:08:08,950 --> 03:08:13,159
Where's the, where do I just buy something?

1351
03:08:17,739 --> 03:08:21,049
Right here.

1352
03:08:21,049 --> 03:08:21,930
Uh, show me your goods.

1353
03:08:21,930 --> 03:08:22,329
Here we go.

1354
03:08:22,329 --> 03:08:25,770
All right, bread, cheese, meat, tacos, meat wrap.

1355
03:08:25,770 --> 03:08:30,579
How much is this?

1356
03:08:30,579 --> 03:08:33,459
It's 316 for the meat wraps.

1357
03:08:33,459 --> 03:08:34,579
How much is bread?

1358
03:08:34,579 --> 03:08:37,940
This is so much money.

1359
03:08:37,940 --> 03:08:38,899
How much do I even have?

1360
03:08:39,700 --> 03:08:45,420
13, okay, hold on.

1361
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:46,379
Meat and bread.

1362
03:08:46,379 --> 03:08:49,430
Okay, I just ate it.

1363
03:08:49,430 --> 03:08:52,940
I don't have enough money.

1364
03:08:52,940 --> 03:08:55,620
Okay, where's the dog?

1365
03:08:56,440 --> 03:09:06,600
Come here, dog.

1366
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:07,799
Where's the dog?

1367
03:09:07,799 --> 03:09:14,659
Come here.

1368
03:09:14,659 --> 03:09:15,379
Eat it.

1369
03:09:15,379 --> 03:09:16,889
How do I feed the dog?

1370
03:09:16,889 --> 03:09:27,290
Did you get it?

1371
03:09:27,290 --> 03:09:27,930
You got it.

1372
03:09:27,930 --> 03:09:34,549
Okay, we're good.

1373
03:09:34,629 --> 03:09:37,750
You're three times idling right now.

1374
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:39,500
They're both eating.

1375
03:09:39,500 --> 03:09:41,340
They're both hungry still, but it's okay.

1376
03:09:41,340 --> 03:09:43,510
I need to make some more money.

1377
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:49,799
Now let's go back up here.

1378
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:52,440
I gotta sell some more stuff, I think.

1379
03:09:52,440 --> 03:10:00,889
I can't like, hold on the alt key to steal.

1380
03:10:00,889 --> 03:10:01,450
I'm not doing that.

1381
03:10:02,309 --> 03:10:04,549
All right, talk to, let's trade.

1382
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:16,920
Um, dried meat is so, so much cheaper than everything else.

1383
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:20,520
And I spent 300 fucking dollars when I could have just bought this.

1384
03:10:23,459 --> 03:10:25,219
Hey, are you stealing my dog?

1385
03:10:26,260 --> 03:10:27,299
Why are you taking my dog?

1386
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:29,670
What?

1387
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:30,389
What's going on?

1388
03:10:34,299 --> 03:10:35,180
What's happening?

1389
03:10:39,479 --> 03:10:50,420
Oh no, the dog's not allowed inside?

1390
03:10:50,979 --> 03:10:54,329
All right, so they've eaten.

1391
03:10:55,129 --> 03:10:59,829
Okay, we're good.

1392
03:11:03,579 --> 03:11:04,379
Bodyguard.

1393
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:09,100
Here, eat it.

1394
03:11:09,659 --> 03:11:13,139
Eat the meat.

1395
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:22,760
Did they not want it right now?

1396
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:23,479
I think they're okay.

1397
03:11:24,659 --> 03:11:27,239
So what, do you only have to eat just one time?

1398
03:11:27,239 --> 03:11:28,360
Eat for yourself, I already did.

1399
03:11:28,920 --> 03:11:32,409
I already ate earlier.

1400
03:11:32,409 --> 03:11:34,489
I guess, can you eat more than one time to speed up?

1401
03:11:34,489 --> 03:11:35,049
I already ate.

1402
03:11:35,530 --> 03:11:38,819
Load the game and buy all the cheap shit.

1403
03:11:39,459 --> 03:11:43,719
It was poisoned.

1404
03:11:48,420 --> 03:11:51,459
The dog keeps passing out and waking up.

1405
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:55,129
I bought the expensive fucking food.

1406
03:11:57,379 --> 03:11:58,979
You can't eat until the bar stops.

1407
03:11:58,979 --> 03:11:59,700
Yeah, that makes sense.

1408
03:12:05,379 --> 03:12:07,299
All right, I got an idea.

1409
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:15,079
It's worth doing.

1410
03:12:15,639 --> 03:12:16,200
I don't care.

1411
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:42,250
There's so much shit to take.

1412
03:12:42,250 --> 03:12:43,049
Chew sticks.

1413
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:47,530
Nobody can see me right now.

1414
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:50,709
All right, we got Saki.

1415
03:12:51,270 --> 03:12:52,309
Took it.

1416
03:12:52,309 --> 03:12:53,270
Committing crime.

1417
03:12:53,270 --> 03:12:54,229
Oh, please.

1418
03:12:54,229 --> 03:12:55,510
I don't care.

1419
03:12:55,510 --> 03:12:56,069
Water.

1420
03:12:56,069 --> 03:12:56,469
Cactus.

1421
03:12:59,459 --> 03:13:00,340
Hacksaw.

1422
03:13:00,340 --> 03:13:01,700
Nobody's seeing this.

1423
03:13:02,260 --> 03:13:06,120
Chew stick.

1424
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:06,600
Let's just see.

1425
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:07,159
Let's go over here.

1426
03:13:12,010 --> 03:13:13,690
Red.

1427
03:13:13,690 --> 03:13:14,569
Chew sticks.

1428
03:13:14,569 --> 03:13:15,209
Chew sticks.

1429
03:13:15,770 --> 03:13:16,569
I can't pick that up.

1430
03:13:16,569 --> 03:13:17,290
Be too far away?

1431
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:21,319
Am I visible?

1432
03:13:21,319 --> 03:13:21,719
No.

1433
03:13:21,719 --> 03:13:22,280
Chew sticks.

1434
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:25,450
Why do I, what did I pick?

1435
03:13:25,450 --> 03:13:26,250
I'm going to go sell this.

1436
03:13:27,719 --> 03:13:29,559
This water jug is huge.

1437
03:13:29,559 --> 03:13:33,879
Okay, I got food.

1438
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:35,719
Chew sticks.

1439
03:13:36,709 --> 03:13:37,430
Meat.

1440
03:13:37,430 --> 03:13:38,229
Saki.

1441
03:13:38,229 --> 03:13:42,329
Let's go sell the hacksaw back to the person that I just came here from.

1442
03:13:42,329 --> 03:13:46,950
No, actually, I can't do that because they know.

1443
03:13:47,510 --> 03:13:52,309
How many times does this dog keep passing out?

1444
03:13:52,790 --> 03:13:53,590
And waking up.

1445
03:13:56,739 --> 03:13:59,299
Fuck.

1446
03:13:59,299 --> 03:14:00,180
Nobody can see this.

1447
03:14:00,739 --> 03:14:02,809
All right, let me get up.

1448
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:17,319
I don't have enough money, but I can't, I'm not going to sell to you.

1449
03:14:18,200 --> 03:14:19,540
Let's do business.

1450
03:14:19,540 --> 03:14:20,340
It'll say, right?

1451
03:14:22,170 --> 03:14:23,930
Stolen from you.

1452
03:14:23,930 --> 03:14:24,809
Fencing chance.

1453
03:14:24,809 --> 03:14:25,770
10 percent.

1454
03:14:25,770 --> 03:14:27,129
So, no, that's not going to work.

1455
03:14:27,770 --> 03:14:38,760
I need to get that huge, I feel so bad for the dog.

1456
03:14:41,909 --> 03:14:42,870
All right, let's go.

1457
03:14:43,750 --> 03:14:49,909
Still, the hunger is still going up though.

1458
03:14:50,549 --> 03:14:53,610
So, eventually, the dog will be okay.

1459
03:14:55,909 --> 03:15:04,329
Let's go sleep somewhere.

1460
03:15:04,329 --> 03:15:06,260
You know what I mean?

1461
03:15:06,260 --> 03:15:08,709
What do we got?

1462
03:15:08,709 --> 03:15:09,590
This is armory.

1463
03:15:10,790 --> 03:15:12,549
I'm going to sell, I have to sell this.

1464
03:15:12,549 --> 03:15:18,649
I have to because I just don't, wait, it's, everything's locked.

1465
03:15:23,260 --> 03:15:24,059
That's a bar.

1466
03:15:24,059 --> 03:15:25,100
We've been in somewhere.

1467
03:15:30,309 --> 03:15:32,229
Sell that guy the water from across the street.

1468
03:15:32,950 --> 03:15:36,170
I mean, I can't really do that.

1469
03:15:36,729 --> 03:15:41,020
It's a lot of bars.

1470
03:15:41,020 --> 03:15:43,590
Yeah, it looks like a weapon shop.

1471
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:46,100
Tools.

1472
03:15:47,989 --> 03:15:48,309
Bar.

1473
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:52,260
Where can I sleep?

1474
03:15:55,100 --> 03:15:56,059
Traveler?

1475
03:15:56,139 --> 03:15:59,260
That's a guy with a backpack and a walking stick.

1476
03:15:59,260 --> 03:16:01,260
That's like, travelers, welcome, right?

1477
03:16:01,260 --> 03:16:02,299
Okay, let's try it.

1478
03:16:02,860 --> 03:16:12,899
The bar, bars have beds.

1479
03:16:12,899 --> 03:16:17,780
Okay, so let me talk to who's in charge here.

1480
03:16:24,260 --> 03:16:25,700
I don't think either one of you are in charge.

1481
03:16:26,420 --> 03:16:26,819
You are.

1482
03:16:27,459 --> 03:16:31,030
What's the percentage chance that I can sell to you?

1483
03:16:31,750 --> 03:16:35,379
Why am I going this far around?

1484
03:16:36,100 --> 03:16:40,059
John, what you got?

1485
03:16:41,610 --> 03:16:42,250
Backpack.

1486
03:16:43,930 --> 03:16:44,969
Robotic arms.

1487
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:47,049
Skeleton legs.

1488
03:16:47,049 --> 03:16:47,930
Skeleton arms.

1489
03:16:49,340 --> 03:16:50,059
Fencing chance.

1490
03:16:50,059 --> 03:16:50,379
20%.

1491
03:16:50,940 --> 03:16:51,819
That's not going to work.

1492
03:16:52,379 --> 03:16:55,100
I got to go to a different town.

1493
03:16:55,100 --> 03:16:55,899
I need more money.

1494
03:17:00,579 --> 03:17:12,860
Poor dog.

1495
03:17:12,860 --> 03:17:14,540
It just keeps getting picked up.

1496
03:17:17,459 --> 03:17:17,940
Leather.

1497
03:17:17,940 --> 03:17:19,139
Leather, but I can't carry this.

1498
03:17:19,139 --> 03:17:20,020
I need a backpack.

1499
03:17:22,260 --> 03:17:23,299
Splint kit.

1500
03:17:23,299 --> 03:17:24,180
Chain mail sheets.

1501
03:17:24,180 --> 03:17:25,299
Wooden bowl.

1502
03:17:25,299 --> 03:17:27,780
No, I'm just going to have to...

1503
03:17:28,659 --> 03:17:29,620
Here's what's going to have to happen.

1504
03:17:29,620 --> 03:17:30,659
I'm just going to have to let the...

1505
03:17:30,659 --> 03:17:31,940
I'm going to have to sleep in the bar.

1506
03:17:33,139 --> 03:17:40,469
And then hopefully when we get up, I'll feel better.

1507
03:17:41,190 --> 03:17:43,129
How much is a room at the inn?

1508
03:17:45,059 --> 03:17:45,780
Is it expensive?

1509
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:48,020
Can I afford it or can I just sleep in here?

1510
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:54,549
Don't idle in times three speed.

1511
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:55,670
Was I?

1512
03:17:59,079 --> 03:17:59,879
Sitting pillow.

1513
03:18:02,379 --> 03:18:05,020
Okay, well I can't sleep in this, but maybe I can go upstairs?

1514
03:18:05,020 --> 03:18:05,819
Are there beds upstairs?

1515
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:15,340
Where's the dog?

1516
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:17,239
Dog spine.

1517
03:18:22,500 --> 03:18:23,379
There are beds up here.

1518
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:24,739
Are they usable?

1519
03:18:25,379 --> 03:18:27,860
Everyone just got up at the same time as if they're about to all shout like,

1520
03:18:27,860 --> 03:18:28,180
Stop!

1521
03:18:33,370 --> 03:18:35,370
200 fucking C for a bed.

1522
03:18:48,780 --> 03:18:49,659
I need more money.

1523
03:18:52,059 --> 03:18:54,219
This is why I needed to mine more shit.

1524
03:19:00,170 --> 03:19:02,889
You just had to have those expensive sausages.

1525
03:19:02,889 --> 03:19:04,489
I just didn't realize that they were...

1526
03:19:05,739 --> 03:19:07,260
Everything was so expensive.

1527
03:19:09,049 --> 03:19:14,729
Like, okay, the scale that I had there was sausages

1528
03:19:14,729 --> 03:19:17,290
and the bread was fucking 250 cents.

1529
03:19:18,010 --> 03:19:20,760
I already...

1530
03:19:20,760 --> 03:19:23,479
Look, I already fed the dog.

1531
03:19:23,479 --> 03:19:24,760
I can't feed him anymore.

1532
03:19:25,479 --> 03:19:34,069
This is just going to have to do for now.

1533
03:19:34,629 --> 03:19:39,110
Can I eat these?

1534
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:44,459
I can feed the dog more.

1535
03:19:51,979 --> 03:19:53,180
Yeah, what are you guys talking about?

1536
03:19:54,780 --> 03:19:55,819
No, you can't.

1537
03:19:55,899 --> 03:19:57,979
Oh my god, I'm gonna get caught for stealing this

1538
03:19:57,979 --> 03:19:59,100
because I just put it on the ground.

1539
03:19:59,100 --> 03:20:00,299
All right, I'm not gonna...

1540
03:20:00,299 --> 03:20:02,059
I know what's going on.

1541
03:20:02,059 --> 03:20:03,500
I know what's going on.

1542
03:20:10,459 --> 03:20:12,700
There is a cool down period when you eat.

1543
03:20:14,840 --> 03:20:41,690
So I just need to sit around.

1544
03:20:42,809 --> 03:20:44,969
I need to find a place to sleep or hang out

1545
03:20:45,690 --> 03:20:48,950
because I can't really go anywhere until this hunger thing wears off.

1546
03:20:49,510 --> 03:21:03,780
Yeah, I have to abandon the bread because I can't pick it up.

1547
03:21:03,780 --> 03:21:06,899
If I pick it up, this guy is going to see me do that and I stole it.

1548
03:21:06,899 --> 03:21:21,500
You don't need to sleep now, it's for recovery.

1549
03:21:21,500 --> 03:21:23,739
So that doesn't make hunger go up faster if you sleep.

1550
03:21:23,739 --> 03:21:24,780
Like it doesn't make it go up.

1551
03:21:25,420 --> 03:21:31,860
All right, I'm going to tell you just forget about all these jobs.

1552
03:21:31,860 --> 03:21:32,979
You need to hang out somewhere.

1553
03:21:33,930 --> 03:21:35,610
Just like go sit over here and relax.

1554
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:39,219
I'm going to go out and I'm going to mine a few more times

1555
03:21:39,219 --> 03:21:40,020
and I'm going to bring them.

1556
03:21:40,020 --> 03:21:41,700
I'm going to just you hang out over here.

1557
03:21:42,260 --> 03:21:43,579
Just you stay.

1558
03:21:47,370 --> 03:21:49,690
I'm going to go and I'm going to take care of this.

1559
03:21:50,489 --> 03:21:53,450
Just throw the...

1560
03:21:53,450 --> 03:21:54,250
This thing's huge.

1561
03:21:54,250 --> 03:21:54,809
I don't want it.

1562
03:21:55,370 --> 03:21:57,129
I need room for fucking mining things.

1563
03:21:58,569 --> 03:21:59,290
Back to the mines.

1564
03:21:59,290 --> 03:21:59,690
Let's go.

1565
03:22:00,409 --> 03:22:09,579
He's going to starve?

1566
03:22:09,579 --> 03:22:10,059
No, he's not.

1567
03:22:12,139 --> 03:22:13,340
There was a mine right out here.

1568
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:19,399
It was like right...

1569
03:22:19,399 --> 03:22:19,879
Where was it?

1570
03:22:19,879 --> 03:22:20,200
Out here?

1571
03:22:23,559 --> 03:22:24,360
Like the back door?

1572
03:22:24,360 --> 03:22:24,760
Side door?

1573
03:22:24,760 --> 03:22:26,360
Where was that mining thing?

1574
03:22:27,079 --> 03:22:31,450
There might be another vein just sitting over here somewhere.

1575
03:22:34,139 --> 03:22:35,180
Why do I walk so slowly?

1576
03:22:35,180 --> 03:22:36,940
Because I'm building up my strength right now.

1577
03:22:39,750 --> 03:22:41,030
The heavier shit that I wear.

1578
03:22:43,350 --> 03:22:46,540
So if I go over here, let's see strength.

1579
03:22:47,180 --> 03:22:49,000
Is that 17 right now?

1580
03:22:49,559 --> 03:22:51,559
It's because I keep wearing this heavy ass armor.

1581
03:22:52,200 --> 03:23:00,780
So let me take a look and see where that vein is.

1582
03:23:02,649 --> 03:23:04,889
There is the other side.

1583
03:23:04,889 --> 03:23:05,850
Wasn't it like down here?

1584
03:23:06,489 --> 03:23:11,290
Where was that vein?

1585
03:23:12,489 --> 03:23:22,069
On the side?

1586
03:23:28,489 --> 03:23:29,209
What the hell is this?

1587
03:23:30,170 --> 03:23:31,639
That's like where he is.

1588
03:23:31,639 --> 03:23:31,959
Okay.

1589
03:23:33,639 --> 03:23:36,489
I wish I could pull the camera out a little bit further.

1590
03:23:37,209 --> 03:23:39,909
Because it's kind of hard to see anything.

1591
03:23:41,770 --> 03:23:42,489
See how like the...

1592
03:23:42,489 --> 03:23:43,610
See what's happening here?

1593
03:23:43,610 --> 03:23:44,409
Just like...

1594
03:23:44,409 --> 03:23:46,569
The camera's like freaking out every time I get to like a divot.

1595
03:23:48,010 --> 03:23:48,329
All right.

1596
03:23:48,969 --> 03:23:58,329
I can't go any further.

1597
03:23:58,329 --> 03:23:59,209
Was it down here?

1598
03:23:59,930 --> 03:24:05,079
I think it was down here, right?

1599
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:16,389
I hope that I'm...

1600
03:24:16,389 --> 03:24:17,430
I hope I'm clicking on this.

1601
03:24:18,149 --> 03:24:25,739
I'm not sure if I'm actually clicking here.

1602
03:24:26,299 --> 03:24:28,200
Or if I'm getting blocked by the...

1603
03:24:29,319 --> 03:24:31,000
No, it looks like I am.

1604
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:31,479
Yeah, I got it.

1605
03:24:31,479 --> 03:24:31,719
Okay.

1606
03:24:36,090 --> 03:24:37,620
All right.

1607
03:24:37,620 --> 03:24:40,659
I need to mine at that vein that's down here somewhere.

1608
03:24:44,299 --> 03:24:49,590
The hell is it?

1609
03:24:49,590 --> 03:24:54,280
I feel like it was right here.

1610
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,170
Maybe a little further back?

1611
03:24:56,809 --> 03:24:58,860
There it is.

1612
03:24:59,420 --> 03:24:59,739
All right.

1613
03:24:59,739 --> 03:25:00,620
Just let me mine here.

1614
03:25:01,340 --> 03:25:10,600
So give information on the richness of resources.

1615
03:25:10,600 --> 03:25:11,159
Prospect.

1616
03:25:14,469 --> 03:25:16,389
Zone arm of a green environment.

1617
03:25:16,389 --> 03:25:16,870
Wait, what?

1618
03:25:17,989 --> 03:25:23,079
Resources of water, iron, fertility, copper.

1619
03:25:23,639 --> 03:25:24,680
So this is just...

1620
03:25:24,680 --> 03:25:26,040
That's what prospecting does.

1621
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:26,600
Just shows it.

1622
03:25:26,600 --> 03:25:26,840
Okay.

1623
03:25:30,180 --> 03:25:31,379
I'll get over there and mine it.

1624
03:25:31,940 --> 03:25:35,420
How's the dog doing?

1625
03:25:36,139 --> 03:25:36,860
Oh, god damn it.

1626
03:25:36,860 --> 03:25:37,579
The dog needs to eat.

1627
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:41,819
What if I run the dog over the bread while I just sit here and do this?

1628
03:25:43,239 --> 03:25:44,760
I drop the bread right here.

1629
03:25:44,760 --> 03:25:45,159
Ready?

1630
03:25:45,719 --> 03:25:47,299
Is he gonna get mad about this?

1631
03:25:47,299 --> 03:25:47,860
I'm just a...

1632
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:48,739
I'm a fucking dog.

1633
03:26:00,469 --> 03:26:01,430
It's right in front of you.

1634
03:26:01,430 --> 03:26:01,909
Just eat it.

1635
03:26:07,579 --> 03:26:08,620
Dogs don't eat bread.

1636
03:26:09,260 --> 03:26:14,860
Give me this.

1637
03:26:20,219 --> 03:26:21,340
I'm filling my whole bag.

1638
03:26:27,139 --> 03:26:28,739
Dogs absolutely eat bread.

1639
03:26:29,690 --> 03:26:30,170
Don't worry.

1640
03:26:30,170 --> 03:26:33,290
I'm gonna buy a bunch of those beef jerkeys and we're gonna eat like kings.

1641
03:26:36,500 --> 03:26:37,540
Throw away the cactus.

1642
03:26:41,299 --> 03:26:42,739
That sells for a lot.

1643
03:26:42,739 --> 03:26:44,500
This thing's stupid.

1644
03:26:52,409 --> 03:26:52,969
You think I'm kidding?

1645
03:26:52,969 --> 03:26:53,770
I'm filling my whole bag.

1646
03:26:54,409 --> 03:26:58,010
I'll be back.

1647
03:26:58,010 --> 03:26:58,329
Don't worry.

1648
03:26:58,329 --> 03:26:58,809
He's gonna be fine.

1649
03:27:08,170 --> 03:27:08,889
Mining music?

1650
03:27:10,420 --> 03:27:11,379
Uh, fine.

1651
03:27:11,379 --> 03:27:12,500
I'll put on some mining music.

1652
03:28:03,659 --> 03:28:04,299
I'm coming.

1653
03:28:05,739 --> 03:28:06,780
I'll get you your food.

1654
03:28:06,780 --> 03:28:07,260
I'm coming.

1655
03:28:07,979 --> 03:28:16,819
Come on.

1656
03:28:16,819 --> 03:28:18,899
Just get a few more pieces of iron.

1657
03:28:20,739 --> 03:28:23,059
Just get a few more pieces of iron.

1658
03:28:23,059 --> 03:28:44,790
All right.

1659
03:28:44,790 --> 03:28:51,959
That's good.

1660
03:28:51,959 --> 03:28:52,680
All right.

1661
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:53,159
Fuck off.

1662
03:28:53,159 --> 03:28:53,559
Let's go.

1663
03:28:58,680 --> 03:28:59,239
Go.

1664
03:28:59,239 --> 03:28:59,819
Hurry.

1665
03:29:16,819 --> 03:29:19,620
When I was doing this, somebody said you are so not funny.

1666
03:29:20,659 --> 03:29:24,020
That wasn't even my call.

1667
03:29:24,020 --> 03:29:24,659
That was...

1668
03:29:24,659 --> 03:29:25,860
People told me to do that.

1669
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:27,379
That wasn't even my joke.

1670
03:29:27,379 --> 03:29:28,899
That wasn't even my call.

1671
03:29:28,899 --> 03:29:46,920
All right.

1672
03:29:46,920 --> 03:29:47,799
Get in there.

1673
03:29:47,799 --> 03:29:51,610
This should be enough for me to buy a bunch of food and then...

1674
03:29:51,610 --> 03:29:58,899
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do then.

1675
03:29:58,899 --> 03:29:59,700
Dog.

1676
03:29:59,700 --> 03:30:03,379
It's all right.

1677
03:30:03,379 --> 03:30:14,069
This dog has passed out and woken up like 30 times.

1678
03:30:14,069 --> 03:30:15,430
Maybe 50 times.

1679
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:18,260
How far away am I?

1680
03:30:19,129 --> 03:30:19,770
Hurry up.

1681
03:30:23,850 --> 03:30:24,649
Get in.

1682
03:30:24,649 --> 03:30:25,049
Get in.

1683
03:30:25,049 --> 03:30:25,450
Get in.

1684
03:30:25,450 --> 03:30:25,930
Get in.

1685
03:30:25,930 --> 03:30:26,329
All right.

1686
03:30:26,329 --> 03:30:26,569
Bar.

1687
03:30:26,569 --> 03:30:26,889
There it is.

1688
03:30:26,889 --> 03:30:27,129
Okay.

1689
03:30:27,129 --> 03:30:27,370
Quickly.

1690
03:30:27,370 --> 03:30:36,469
Come on.

1691
03:30:36,469 --> 03:30:46,809
Buy a shitload of those meat sticks.

1692
03:30:46,809 --> 03:30:47,610
Talk to.

1693
03:30:47,610 --> 03:30:48,090
Trade.

1694
03:30:48,649 --> 03:30:49,610
Show me what you got.

1695
03:30:49,610 --> 03:30:58,180
I got these rocks and I would like to buy from you dried meat.

1696
03:31:01,799 --> 03:31:09,879
And that's it.

1697
03:31:09,879 --> 03:31:11,159
That's all I can afford.

1698
03:31:11,159 --> 03:31:12,700
All right.

1699
03:31:12,700 --> 03:31:12,940
Dog.

1700
03:31:12,940 --> 03:31:13,739
Come on.

1701
03:31:13,739 --> 03:31:23,510
Where are you?

1702
03:31:23,510 --> 03:31:24,180
All right.

1703
03:31:24,180 --> 03:31:24,979
I need a reunion here.

1704
03:31:24,979 --> 03:31:25,620
Come on.

1705
03:31:25,620 --> 03:31:31,819
Come on.

1706
03:31:31,819 --> 03:31:33,180
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

1707
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:35,819
I made it.

1708
03:31:35,819 --> 03:31:40,020
Okay.

1709
03:31:40,020 --> 03:31:41,260
Trade.

1710
03:31:41,260 --> 03:31:43,100
Here.

1711
03:31:43,100 --> 03:31:43,420
No.

1712
03:31:43,420 --> 03:31:44,139
Never mind.

1713
03:31:44,139 --> 03:31:53,180
Just gotta wait till you wake back up.

1714
03:31:53,180 --> 03:31:53,819
Eat that food.

1715
03:32:15,610 --> 03:32:19,379
Got it.

1716
03:32:19,379 --> 03:32:21,579
Okay.

1717
03:32:21,579 --> 03:32:22,459
Now, I'm gonna...

1718
03:32:22,459 --> 03:32:25,500
I'm gonna leave you with a piece of meat here.

1719
03:32:25,500 --> 03:32:28,760
So when you get hungry again, you eat that.

1720
03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:30,920
But I have to go back over there and I need to mine...

1721
03:32:31,719 --> 03:32:33,719
I need to mine again.

1722
03:32:33,719 --> 03:32:41,079
So you eat that when you're ready.

1723
03:32:41,079 --> 03:32:43,799
You just hang out there and eat that when you're ready.

1724
03:32:43,799 --> 03:32:47,479
Let me save.

1725
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:55,219
This is just gonna be the rest of the stream.

1726
03:32:55,219 --> 03:32:56,659
But this is what you have to do.

1727
03:32:57,219 --> 03:32:58,260
It's about survival.

1728
03:32:58,899 --> 03:33:08,569
Where...

1729
03:33:08,569 --> 03:33:11,129
I just keep forgetting where the fuck I was going before.

1730
03:33:11,850 --> 03:33:13,209
All these rocks.

1731
03:33:13,770 --> 03:33:16,379
Where's the prospect?

1732
03:33:17,180 --> 03:33:20,139
Stone.

1733
03:33:20,860 --> 03:33:21,979
No, there is none.

1734
03:33:21,979 --> 03:33:22,620
Is there...

1735
03:33:22,620 --> 03:33:23,659
Is there none over there again?

1736
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:29,899
There's so much more to the game.

1737
03:33:29,899 --> 03:33:30,219
There's more...

1738
03:33:30,219 --> 03:33:30,700
Oh, I know.

1739
03:33:35,239 --> 03:33:37,239
But you can't just go see it all.

1740
03:33:37,239 --> 03:33:41,719
You need to start from a piece of crap that can't even afford to bite dried meat leaves.

1741
03:33:47,379 --> 03:33:48,500
You can build your own cities.

1742
03:33:49,139 --> 03:33:51,239
Yeah, that's fucking awesome.

1743
03:33:58,010 --> 03:34:00,969
All right.

1744
03:34:00,969 --> 03:34:07,590
So while he's relaxing, I really do need to figure out where the hell I was gonna go.

1745
03:34:08,469 --> 03:34:11,270
Because I can't just run out into the wilderness again.

1746
03:34:11,989 --> 03:34:13,819
Let's go down here.

1747
03:34:17,159 --> 03:34:18,120
What is this?

1748
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:19,000
Is there something over there?

1749
03:34:26,360 --> 03:34:27,079
Are you winning?

1750
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:28,920
Not yet.

1751
03:34:31,899 --> 03:34:32,700
Strength is at...

1752
03:34:33,500 --> 03:34:34,309
Let's find out.

1753
03:34:34,950 --> 03:34:36,870
Strength is at 18.

1754
03:34:46,780 --> 03:34:47,420
Keep going.

1755
03:34:48,059 --> 03:34:48,940
Back down here.

1756
03:34:49,899 --> 03:34:51,700
Dog is still eating.

1757
03:34:52,659 --> 03:35:01,959
I don't know if mining is the best, most lucrative way to get money for your sick dog.

1758
03:35:02,760 --> 03:35:04,120
Well, it's the only thing I got right now.

1759
03:35:04,840 --> 03:35:17,049
Let's do it.

1760
03:35:18,329 --> 03:35:19,690
Now I can fill in my backpack.

1761
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:29,780
Man and dog is secret hard mode.

1762
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:31,940
You have to feed two mouths right away.

1763
03:35:32,579 --> 03:35:35,000
I didn't even think about it like that.

1764
03:35:37,159 --> 03:35:37,719
That's true.

1765
03:35:37,719 --> 03:35:38,600
I didn't even think about that.

1766
03:35:39,239 --> 03:35:47,750
Put on the mining music.

1767
03:35:48,549 --> 03:36:01,290
No, somebody didn't like that, so I'm not doing it.

1768
03:36:01,290 --> 03:36:02,649
One guy, yeah.

1769
03:36:02,649 --> 03:36:18,219
How much is in this vein?

1770
03:36:18,219 --> 03:36:22,920
I mean, condition...

1771
03:36:22,920 --> 03:36:24,520
The building is in good condition.

1772
03:36:24,520 --> 03:36:25,799
Iron quality, 100.

1773
03:36:26,360 --> 03:36:29,370
Can I have up to three workers here?

1774
03:36:29,930 --> 03:36:33,739
Efficiency, max efficiency.

1775
03:36:34,299 --> 03:36:39,100
I'm going to be iron rich.

1776
03:36:39,100 --> 03:36:49,620
Just build your shack next to the ore.

1777
03:36:49,620 --> 03:36:50,979
That's a pretty great idea.

1778
03:36:50,979 --> 03:37:02,700
Can I build my house right here?

1779
03:37:02,700 --> 03:37:04,459
Is the point of the game to be boring?

1780
03:37:08,620 --> 03:37:12,500
I don't think this is particularly boring.

1781
03:37:12,500 --> 03:37:19,799
I think the point of the game is you kind of have to very painfully start from zero.

1782
03:37:34,059 --> 03:37:35,659
You got to earn your place at the top.

1783
03:37:37,049 --> 03:37:40,200
By having your dog...

1784
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:41,479
Did you eat the food that was here?

1785
03:37:41,479 --> 03:37:42,120
What happened to the food?

1786
03:37:42,120 --> 03:37:45,540
Did you already eat it?

1787
03:37:45,540 --> 03:37:47,379
What happened to the food that I put down here?

1788
03:37:47,379 --> 03:37:59,129
Did somebody take it?

1789
03:37:59,129 --> 03:38:03,020
Someone stole the food.

1790
03:38:03,020 --> 03:38:25,750
Well, I'll be back in a minute.

1791
03:38:25,750 --> 03:38:28,709
Why would you expect the game to have the dog auto eat the food?

1792
03:38:28,709 --> 03:38:29,110
I don't know.

1793
03:38:29,110 --> 03:38:30,870
I figured he would smell it and it would be in front of him.

1794
03:38:42,329 --> 03:38:43,450
I'm just going to get a few more.

1795
03:38:44,180 --> 03:38:46,889
Because I don't want to do this again.

1796
03:38:46,889 --> 03:38:51,399
I want to continue my journey going to where I wanted to go.

1797
03:38:53,129 --> 03:38:53,370
Hold on.

1798
03:38:53,370 --> 03:38:54,010
I can boot this.

1799
03:38:54,569 --> 03:38:59,959
I think that's full stack.

1800
03:38:59,959 --> 03:39:01,459
I can't even do a full stack.

1801
03:39:07,959 --> 03:39:09,559
It's like starving again.

1802
03:39:09,559 --> 03:39:10,680
I'm doing just fine.

1803
03:39:21,049 --> 03:39:22,329
Get a backpack before going.

1804
03:39:22,329 --> 03:39:23,049
Yeah, that's what I'll do.

1805
03:39:23,610 --> 03:39:25,940
I'm going to buy a few more pieces of jerky.

1806
03:39:25,940 --> 03:39:26,340
Give the...

1807
03:39:26,340 --> 03:39:27,620
The dog needs to eat again.

1808
03:39:29,100 --> 03:39:30,780
This really is just the...

1809
03:39:30,780 --> 03:39:31,899
The dog is becoming...

1810
03:39:32,700 --> 03:39:33,260
What is this?

1811
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:38,729
Only two more and we're done.

1812
03:39:42,870 --> 03:39:44,549
The dog is draining you.

1813
03:39:45,270 --> 03:39:48,790
Look at the amount of work that I have to do to keep this dog around.

1814
03:39:49,430 --> 03:39:53,209
See how hard I work?

1815
03:39:53,850 --> 03:39:54,809
I don't want to lose him.

1816
03:39:59,909 --> 03:40:00,950
Abandon the dog.

1817
03:40:00,950 --> 03:40:02,389
I can't abandon the dog.

1818
03:40:02,389 --> 03:40:04,389
It's going to eat all my beef jerky but it's going to be...

1819
03:40:04,389 --> 03:40:04,870
Whatever.

1820
03:40:13,860 --> 03:40:14,979
I can't make the dog work.

1821
03:40:14,979 --> 03:40:16,500
The dog doesn't have any skills.

1822
03:40:17,139 --> 03:40:18,219
All right, let's go.

1823
03:40:23,899 --> 03:40:24,379
Get up there.

1824
03:40:24,940 --> 03:40:27,610
He actually did eat the food.

1825
03:40:27,610 --> 03:40:28,729
I'm at times three speed.

1826
03:40:32,069 --> 03:40:33,989
Let's go get it up there.

1827
03:40:34,870 --> 03:40:40,809
Make the dog have a job.

1828
03:40:41,850 --> 03:40:44,659
I'm not sure it's possible.

1829
03:40:45,540 --> 03:40:47,399
Hurry.

1830
03:40:47,959 --> 03:40:54,549
He's starting to pause the game while idling.

1831
03:40:55,190 --> 03:40:55,989
PogChamp.

1832
03:41:00,459 --> 03:41:01,180
Strike check.

1833
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:01,819
Let's take a look.

1834
03:41:03,989 --> 03:41:04,629
19.

1835
03:41:09,989 --> 03:41:11,989
Look how terrible everything else is.

1836
03:41:11,989 --> 03:41:13,110
How do I get toughness?

1837
03:41:15,299 --> 03:41:15,780
I don't know.

1838
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:25,819
26 and laboring.

1839
03:41:27,479 --> 03:41:29,399
I have to get beat up for toughness.

1840
03:41:30,200 --> 03:41:33,430
So people have to kick the shit out of me for me to...

1841
03:41:33,430 --> 03:41:33,670
Okay.

1842
03:41:34,629 --> 03:41:35,989
This should give me enough food.

1843
03:41:36,870 --> 03:41:39,979
This is going to be like one, two, three, four, five, six.

1844
03:41:39,979 --> 03:41:40,860
This should be about...

1845
03:41:40,860 --> 03:41:41,260
All right.

1846
03:41:41,260 --> 03:41:42,059
How much is a backpack?

1847
03:41:58,579 --> 03:42:01,219
Alt F4 from this awful MMO.

1848
03:42:02,340 --> 03:42:03,219
No, that's...

1849
03:42:03,219 --> 03:42:04,500
You got the wrong idea.

1850
03:42:04,500 --> 03:42:04,739
Look.

1851
03:42:05,879 --> 03:42:10,920
Just because I'm mining ore to feed my starving dog that's passing out every 30 seconds.

1852
03:42:11,479 --> 03:42:11,719
No.

1853
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:13,000
There's not...

1854
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:13,399
There's like...

1855
03:42:14,360 --> 03:42:15,879
Just wait till I build my own city.

1856
03:42:16,440 --> 03:42:18,680
Didn't you see the back of the box?

1857
03:42:19,319 --> 03:42:22,700
Where am I going?

1858
03:42:22,700 --> 03:42:23,579
I'm going the wrong way.

1859
03:42:24,299 --> 03:42:32,219
All right.

1860
03:42:32,219 --> 03:42:32,940
Buy more food.

1861
03:42:32,940 --> 03:42:33,819
Actually, I don't...

1862
03:42:33,819 --> 03:42:34,459
Yeah, I do.

1863
03:42:34,459 --> 03:42:35,020
Do I have any...

1864
03:42:35,739 --> 03:42:36,620
I've been eating it.

1865
03:42:37,180 --> 03:42:39,540
So food.

1866
03:42:40,180 --> 03:42:42,899
Get on in.

1867
03:42:43,459 --> 03:42:50,569
Let's do business.

1868
03:42:51,209 --> 03:42:52,329
All right.

1869
03:42:52,329 --> 03:42:55,290
I'm going to get 97 for these.

1870
03:42:56,250 --> 03:42:59,659
All right.

1871
03:42:59,659 --> 03:43:00,139
Give me.

1872
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:02,059
So this is dried meat.

1873
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:05,930
Is there anything else cheaper here?

1874
03:43:05,930 --> 03:43:07,850
Am I about to buy up the whole entire place?

1875
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:12,059
737.

1876
03:43:12,059 --> 03:43:12,940
I need a backpack.

1877
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:14,379
Full backpack.

1878
03:43:14,940 --> 03:43:19,750
I can't afford that one.

1879
03:43:19,750 --> 03:43:30,069
I'm going to buy up every bar of their fucking slim gems.

1880
03:43:30,790 --> 03:43:32,040
All right.

1881
03:43:32,040 --> 03:43:32,520
Come here, you.

1882
03:43:33,879 --> 03:43:34,360
Come with me.

1883
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:50,889
Unconscious of 20 seconds and then eat that.

1884
03:43:51,530 --> 03:43:55,930
All right.

1885
03:43:55,930 --> 03:43:56,729
Ate the dried meat.

1886
03:43:56,729 --> 03:43:56,969
Good.

1887
03:43:57,770 --> 03:43:58,569
Now relax.

1888
03:43:59,209 --> 03:43:59,690
I keep...

1889
03:43:59,690 --> 03:44:01,690
I'm just treading water with this dog.

1890
03:44:09,979 --> 03:44:10,540
Okay.

1891
03:44:10,540 --> 03:44:12,809
Let's go to the other bar.

1892
03:44:12,809 --> 03:44:23,319
Do you have a backpack I can buy that's cheaper?

1893
03:44:26,059 --> 03:44:26,860
Sleeping bag.

1894
03:44:27,579 --> 03:44:30,069
You got like dried meat.

1895
03:44:30,069 --> 03:44:30,549
Should I just...

1896
03:44:33,940 --> 03:44:34,819
I don't know.

1897
03:44:34,819 --> 03:44:35,059
Okay.

1898
03:44:35,059 --> 03:44:39,180
Should I just buy a bunch more meat and then...

1899
03:44:40,299 --> 03:44:43,739
Or should I get a backpack?

1900
03:44:43,739 --> 03:44:49,030
There's a cheap backpack right here.

1901
03:44:54,219 --> 03:44:55,899
Sell pants and armor.

1902
03:44:55,899 --> 03:44:57,180
Buy traders backpack.

1903
03:44:57,989 --> 03:44:58,389
I did it.

1904
03:44:58,389 --> 03:44:58,629
All right.

1905
03:44:58,629 --> 03:44:59,030
I did it.

1906
03:44:59,030 --> 03:45:00,469
Somebody said to do it and I did it.

1907
03:45:00,469 --> 03:45:08,790
I need the money.

1908
03:45:11,799 --> 03:45:13,799
I desperately need this money.

1909
03:45:13,799 --> 03:45:21,079
All right.

1910
03:45:21,079 --> 03:45:23,670
So I stole that shit anyways.

1911
03:45:23,670 --> 03:45:24,950
I can steal it again.

1912
03:45:24,950 --> 03:45:31,510
So I can get a sleeping bag, a scavenger's basket,

1913
03:45:33,100 --> 03:45:37,260
a cheap and useful backpack commonly associated with peasants and scavengers.

1914
03:45:37,899 --> 03:45:38,780
Get it.

1915
03:45:38,780 --> 03:45:42,149
You didn't need to sell the pants.

1916
03:45:42,870 --> 03:45:46,899
I'm going to buy some more meat.

1917
03:45:46,899 --> 03:45:56,809
Okay.

1918
03:45:57,370 --> 03:45:59,690
I'm going to save some money.

1919
03:46:06,379 --> 03:46:07,739
Don't sell the chest piece.

1920
03:46:07,739 --> 03:46:09,819
Well, I can't.

1921
03:46:09,819 --> 03:46:10,219
I did it.

1922
03:46:10,780 --> 03:46:11,739
I bought the shitty one.

1923
03:46:11,739 --> 03:46:12,540
Well, that's...

1924
03:46:13,739 --> 03:46:15,100
What's wrong with the shitty one?

1925
03:46:15,100 --> 03:46:16,059
It still works.

1926
03:46:16,059 --> 03:46:16,940
You put stuff in it.

1927
03:46:24,709 --> 03:46:25,030
All right.

1928
03:46:26,549 --> 03:46:29,270
It's actually a drum on my back.

1929
03:46:29,909 --> 03:46:33,639
I just turned into a different character.

1930
03:46:37,219 --> 03:46:41,899
Look at this.

1931
03:46:41,899 --> 03:46:43,659
We're just getting started with this game.

1932
03:46:43,659 --> 03:46:44,219
You see this?

1933
03:46:45,479 --> 03:46:45,799
Look.

1934
03:46:47,399 --> 03:46:48,920
Are you looking?

1935
03:46:48,920 --> 03:46:49,559
Are you looking?

1936
03:46:50,280 --> 03:46:59,909
All right.

1937
03:46:59,909 --> 03:47:00,229
Let's go.

1938
03:47:01,690 --> 03:47:02,010
Dog.

1939
03:47:02,010 --> 03:47:03,129
I'm going to carry the dog.

1940
03:47:03,930 --> 03:47:07,450
You can stack in backpacks.

1941
03:47:08,010 --> 03:47:17,319
Let's go to the adventure shop.

1942
03:47:17,879 --> 03:47:22,920
I'm going to take a mechanic.

1943
03:47:23,559 --> 03:47:24,280
Let's go over here.

1944
03:47:24,920 --> 03:47:27,049
What's this?

1945
03:47:27,610 --> 03:47:28,170
Armorer.

1946
03:47:29,670 --> 03:47:29,989
Here.

1947
03:47:30,709 --> 03:47:34,010
You can stack in the trader's backpack.

1948
03:47:35,180 --> 03:47:36,940
Well, that's not the trader's backpack.

1949
03:47:37,500 --> 03:47:41,370
Are you looking at this?

1950
03:47:53,770 --> 03:47:58,469
Medium backpack.

1951
03:47:58,469 --> 03:48:00,229
Glorious holy map.

1952
03:48:00,229 --> 03:48:01,110
Small backpack.

1953
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:12,780
Do you have any no trader backpacks?

1954
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:13,260
That's fine.

1955
03:48:13,260 --> 03:48:15,500
I'm okay with my drum.

1956
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:16,459
Cheap, useful backpack.

1957
03:48:16,459 --> 03:48:17,899
I'm just getting started.

1958
03:48:17,899 --> 03:48:18,860
I've just started the game.

1959
03:48:19,420 --> 03:48:21,049
All right.

1960
03:48:21,049 --> 03:48:22,569
What about standard first aid kits?

1961
03:48:23,590 --> 03:48:25,190
I have a basic first aid kit.

1962
03:48:25,829 --> 03:48:26,790
Do you sell basics?

1963
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:28,229
Who ate that?

1964
03:48:28,229 --> 03:48:29,350
Did she just eat that out of my...

1965
03:48:30,149 --> 03:48:31,110
Who just ate that?

1966
03:48:31,750 --> 03:48:32,309
Somebody did.

1967
03:48:32,309 --> 03:48:32,629
I did.

1968
03:48:34,979 --> 03:48:35,219
Okay.

1969
03:48:35,219 --> 03:48:37,059
I'm going to say let's get some basic first aid kits.

1970
03:48:40,200 --> 03:48:41,719
What's happening right now?

1971
03:48:41,719 --> 03:48:43,079
Did the dog just eat?

1972
03:48:47,110 --> 03:48:48,229
Give the dog a backpack.

1973
03:48:53,450 --> 03:48:54,250
Small backpack.

1974
03:48:54,250 --> 03:48:55,049
I don't have enough money.

1975
03:48:57,209 --> 03:48:58,090
I need first aid.

1976
03:48:58,090 --> 03:48:59,290
I got to keep myself.

1977
03:48:59,290 --> 03:48:59,610
Okay.

1978
03:49:02,170 --> 03:49:03,129
Doggy backpack.

1979
03:49:03,129 --> 03:49:04,170
I can't afford it.

1980
03:49:11,049 --> 03:49:12,250
I have a 21% chance.

1981
03:49:12,809 --> 03:49:16,020
Why is there a bird inside of this building?

1982
03:49:18,120 --> 03:49:19,159
No, I can't do it.

1983
03:49:19,799 --> 03:49:40,950
I'm not selling the dog.

1984
03:49:44,040 --> 03:49:44,760
The bird.

1985
03:49:45,319 --> 03:49:46,329
What's in here?

1986
03:50:03,899 --> 03:50:05,020
Oh, come on.

1987
03:50:05,020 --> 03:50:12,979
Is there nothing in here?

1988
03:50:12,979 --> 03:50:14,520
Oh, fuck.

1989
03:50:15,079 --> 03:50:18,579
You give me...

1990
03:50:18,579 --> 03:50:19,219
What happened?

1991
03:50:19,219 --> 03:50:19,860
What?

1992
03:50:19,860 --> 03:50:25,559
Did that just burp?

1993
03:50:37,030 --> 03:50:39,110
I let out like a huge belt.

1994
03:50:44,899 --> 03:50:50,059
33%.

1995
03:50:50,059 --> 03:50:51,719
Come on, that's a third.

1996
03:50:51,719 --> 03:50:53,319
If I gave you a $100 bill and said,

1997
03:50:53,639 --> 03:50:56,120
there's a 33% chance that that's going to turn into $300.

1998
03:50:57,159 --> 03:51:00,440
But there's also a 66% chance that it's going to go to zero.

1999
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:01,479
You're going to take that bet.

2000
03:51:02,600 --> 03:51:03,479
You are.

2001
03:51:03,479 --> 03:51:15,739
What is up here?

2002
03:51:15,739 --> 03:51:17,020
Look at all this stuff.

2003
03:51:17,020 --> 03:51:20,659
There's so many machines in here.

2004
03:51:20,659 --> 03:51:21,139
Gears.

2005
03:51:24,389 --> 03:51:27,639
What?

2006
03:51:27,639 --> 03:51:30,680
800 cents to skeletal repair the dog.

2007
03:51:30,680 --> 03:52:00,120
I need all the food I can get.

2008
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:01,079
All right, let's go.

2009
03:52:01,079 --> 03:52:04,069
The dog's out of food.

2010
03:52:04,629 --> 03:52:06,579
Am I already actually out of food?

2011
03:52:06,579 --> 03:52:07,700
No, I got lots.

2012
03:52:07,700 --> 03:52:08,260
I got plenty.

2013
03:52:08,899 --> 03:52:11,909
Dog can be just fine.

2014
03:52:12,549 --> 03:52:15,110
I'm going to take a stroll.

2015
03:52:15,110 --> 03:52:16,709
I don't need to sneak anymore.

2016
03:52:16,709 --> 03:52:23,750
Very stealthy with a drum on your back.

2017
03:52:25,780 --> 03:52:26,260
I'm fine.

2018
03:52:27,079 --> 03:52:27,399
Okay.

2019
03:52:28,680 --> 03:52:31,159
Now, I got to pee.

2020
03:52:31,159 --> 03:52:33,239
It's been like four hours that I haven't peed once.

2021
03:52:33,239 --> 03:52:33,879
I'm going to piss.

2022
03:52:34,440 --> 03:52:35,159
I'll be right back.

2023
03:52:35,879 --> 03:52:41,559
We will continue the mission to survive.

2024
03:52:41,559 --> 03:52:42,920
That's the only thing we're trying to do.

2025
03:52:43,559 --> 03:52:44,600
I'll be right back.

2026
03:52:44,600 --> 03:52:45,940
See you in two seconds.

2027
03:52:46,500 --> 03:55:09,350
Ow!

2028
03:55:09,350 --> 03:55:16,170
Is he still a slave?

2029
03:55:16,170 --> 03:55:19,610
No, I changed because it was too hard.

2030
03:55:19,610 --> 03:55:24,069
It was like it was at the extreme of you start as nothing.

2031
03:55:24,069 --> 03:55:27,190
Maybe one day.

2032
03:55:27,190 --> 03:55:28,790
That'd be fun for me to do.

2033
03:55:28,790 --> 03:55:36,569
That's good.

2034
03:55:36,569 --> 03:55:38,569
Okay, I like this game.

2035
03:55:41,180 --> 03:55:49,579
Whoa, that's $100 from Flimflam.

2036
03:55:52,420 --> 03:55:55,190
Thank you, Flimflam, for the 100 bucks.

2037
03:55:55,190 --> 03:55:56,149
Aw, snap.

2038
03:55:56,149 --> 03:55:57,670
Is that a streamer that I hear?

2039
03:56:01,379 --> 03:56:02,739
It is.

2040
03:56:02,739 --> 03:56:03,059
It is.

2041
03:56:03,059 --> 03:56:04,979
Thank you so much for the $100.

2042
03:56:07,879 --> 03:56:09,319
That's five or six pizzas?

2043
03:56:09,319 --> 03:56:11,719
Well, no, that's five or six like double, triple deals

2044
03:56:12,280 --> 03:56:15,219
from Pizza Hut or Domino's or something.

2045
03:56:15,780 --> 03:56:17,780
It's like 20 bucks for two or three large pizzas.

2046
03:56:18,420 --> 03:56:20,600
That's pretty great.

2047
03:56:26,489 --> 03:56:28,629
But thank you so much.

2048
03:56:29,450 --> 03:56:30,250
That's a lot of money.

2049
03:56:30,809 --> 03:56:34,760
What was I doing?

2050
03:56:35,319 --> 03:56:37,770
But it is a streamer.

2051
03:56:38,489 --> 03:56:40,250
Or I don't know.

2052
03:56:40,250 --> 03:56:42,809
Just kind of a guy right here.

2053
03:56:42,809 --> 03:56:43,850
You found a blueprint.

2054
03:56:44,569 --> 03:56:46,489
Blueprints allow you to learn tech instantly.

2055
03:56:46,489 --> 03:56:48,010
To learn a blueprint, open your inventory

2056
03:56:48,010 --> 03:56:49,209
and right click it to learn it.

2057
03:56:49,930 --> 03:56:52,540
If you're wearing a backpack, make sure to close it first

2058
03:56:52,540 --> 03:56:54,379
so that the blueprint doesn't switch between your inventory

2059
03:56:54,379 --> 03:56:55,260
and your backpack, okay?

2060
03:56:56,709 --> 03:56:57,209
What?

2061
03:56:59,670 --> 03:57:00,309
Chew sticks.

2062
03:57:00,950 --> 03:57:07,110
I can learn how to chew on sticks.

2063
03:57:07,750 --> 03:57:12,659
Cool it with the slurping.

2064
03:57:14,139 --> 03:57:15,739
I know people like hate that shit up.

2065
03:57:15,739 --> 03:57:19,020
So I think just do it because it sounds fun to me.

2066
03:57:19,020 --> 03:57:26,540
What's the dog doing?

2067
03:57:26,540 --> 03:57:28,250
Almost okay.

2068
03:57:32,940 --> 03:57:33,659
Stop slurping.

2069
03:57:33,659 --> 03:57:34,219
It's rude.

2070
03:57:35,559 --> 03:57:38,360
Well, you know, there are some cultures

2071
03:57:38,920 --> 03:57:42,680
where slurping is actually a sign of happiness

2072
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:45,479
and being well taken care of,

2073
03:57:45,479 --> 03:57:46,680
especially if you have like a restaurant.

2074
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:49,079
It's actually seen as a sign of respect.

2075
03:58:00,649 --> 03:58:01,290
That's soup.

2076
03:58:05,590 --> 03:58:06,069
What?

2077
03:58:06,069 --> 03:58:07,909
No, I just know that information.

2078
03:58:09,299 --> 03:58:12,500
Well, I'm not saying that I'm going to do it.

2079
03:58:13,459 --> 03:58:14,340
Look, can I just carry?

2080
03:58:16,120 --> 03:58:18,040
I know that's true because I do what?

2081
03:58:19,270 --> 03:58:35,079
I'm not just making it up.

2082
03:58:35,079 --> 03:58:36,360
Noodles equals soup.

2083
03:58:46,469 --> 03:58:47,989
Where am I going to take my fucking dog?

2084
03:58:50,020 --> 03:58:51,139
Why am I still carrying the dog?

2085
03:58:51,139 --> 03:58:53,139
Because I want the dog to be able to rest

2086
03:58:53,139 --> 03:58:56,819
because the dog is currently starving and unconscious.

2087
03:58:58,489 --> 03:58:59,930
So I'm trying to do my best.

2088
03:59:01,610 --> 03:59:02,889
I'm not supposed to be idling like that.

2089
03:59:02,889 --> 03:59:03,389
All right.

2090
03:59:04,620 --> 03:59:05,260
Open up the map.

2091
03:59:06,329 --> 03:59:07,770
Continue with what I was going to do.

2092
03:59:07,770 --> 03:59:13,579
Remember this town exists because I'm going to keep...

2093
03:59:13,579 --> 03:59:14,459
I want to go to the river.

2094
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:16,020
All right.

2095
03:59:16,020 --> 03:59:18,500
On the way to the river, I got some food.

2096
03:59:19,299 --> 03:59:27,379
The dog has just been suffering this whole time.

2097
03:59:28,979 --> 03:59:29,379
It's okay.

2098
03:59:29,379 --> 03:59:30,819
I got a box full of food.

2099
03:59:33,129 --> 03:59:37,690
I have a big college laundry bag full of snacks to eat.

2100
03:59:41,129 --> 03:59:44,649
So he can just rest on my shoulder and eat out of the bag.

2101
03:59:51,139 --> 03:59:52,100
Let's move.

2102
03:59:52,100 --> 03:59:55,450
I think I just break his neck.

2103
03:59:56,340 --> 03:59:56,739
Let's just...

2104
03:59:56,739 --> 03:59:57,459
Okay, hold on.

2105
03:59:58,260 --> 04:00:04,549
I thought I just went too fast and snapped his neck.

2106
04:00:05,190 --> 04:00:05,989
Holy shit.

2107
04:00:06,549 --> 04:00:07,030
All right.

2108
04:00:10,549 --> 04:00:12,469
I am no longer hungry.

2109
04:00:15,129 --> 04:00:16,969
Let's go back to running.

2110
04:00:20,709 --> 04:00:21,110
Okay.

2111
04:00:22,540 --> 04:00:24,299
Dog is still on cooldown.

2112
04:00:24,940 --> 04:00:30,469
Can I do anything else?

2113
04:00:31,030 --> 04:00:32,709
Anybody else that wants to trade?

2114
04:00:32,709 --> 04:00:36,870
Do I have any other people who want to join my cause here of surviving?

2115
04:00:39,700 --> 04:00:41,700
I don't think so, but I'm ready to go out into the wilderness.

2116
04:00:41,700 --> 04:00:42,659
He'll heal eventually.

2117
04:00:42,659 --> 04:00:44,020
I'm going to keep him up here hanging out.

2118
04:00:44,899 --> 04:00:45,700
Let's go to the river.

2119
04:00:46,340 --> 04:00:57,610
We got to save.

2120
04:00:57,610 --> 04:00:58,569
Auto-save is right here.

2121
04:01:14,739 --> 04:01:16,100
The backpack is bigger than me.

2122
04:01:17,319 --> 04:01:18,680
Yes, it kind of is.

2123
04:01:19,319 --> 04:01:23,579
Now, I'm starting to learn the ropes a little.

2124
04:01:23,579 --> 04:01:23,979
I'm this...

2125
04:01:23,979 --> 04:01:24,540
I'm...

2126
04:01:24,540 --> 04:01:25,100
This is going to...

2127
04:01:25,100 --> 04:01:25,819
I'm enjoying this.

2128
04:01:26,459 --> 04:01:36,809
I feel like this is the kind of game that you could just dunk 500 hours in.

2129
04:01:37,450 --> 04:01:49,049
Yeah, you put a lot of time into this game.

2130
04:01:50,709 --> 04:01:51,670
Can you train the dog?

2131
04:01:52,309 --> 04:01:52,950
I have no idea.

2132
04:01:53,829 --> 04:01:57,989
But the dog is just barely now able to not be unconscious.

2133
04:01:58,709 --> 04:02:05,219
Is the game worth it?

2134
04:02:09,690 --> 04:02:12,709
That depends on what you want out of it, you know?

2135
04:02:13,430 --> 04:02:14,469
Because take a look, right?

2136
04:02:15,190 --> 04:02:17,030
If you just want to walk around and...

2137
04:02:17,750 --> 04:02:19,510
There are no rules to the game.

2138
04:02:19,510 --> 04:02:20,629
It says it on the back of the box.

2139
04:02:22,840 --> 04:02:27,500
If you just want to play a game where your character sucks

2140
04:02:28,139 --> 04:02:32,889
and you can walk around anywhere on the map and there are no rules,

2141
04:02:35,959 --> 04:02:36,440
then sure.

2142
04:02:37,159 --> 04:02:38,969
Some people probably say,

2143
04:02:38,969 --> 04:02:39,850
I don't want to do that.

2144
04:02:39,850 --> 04:02:40,889
That sounds kind of boring.

2145
04:02:40,889 --> 04:02:44,889
And I don't want to just be like a useless idiot the whole game.

2146
04:02:45,530 --> 04:02:49,540
Well, I mean, then this game is not for you.

2147
04:02:49,540 --> 04:02:57,430
Would a fan of Fallout like this game?

2148
04:02:58,149 --> 04:02:59,700
The original?

2149
04:02:59,700 --> 04:03:00,739
Like Fallout 1 and 2?

2150
04:03:00,739 --> 04:03:01,139
Probably.

2151
04:03:13,110 --> 04:03:15,190
I would say that would make some sense.

2152
04:03:20,329 --> 04:03:22,090
Playing an NPC in a big world.

2153
04:03:22,090 --> 04:03:23,450
Yeah, that kind of is what this is.

2154
04:03:25,370 --> 04:03:25,930
How's the dog?

2155
04:03:26,649 --> 04:03:27,290
Doing all right.

2156
04:03:27,930 --> 04:03:32,020
It's like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld.

2157
04:03:32,020 --> 04:03:32,520
Yeah.

2158
04:03:33,379 --> 04:03:35,620
Because you can build cities.

2159
04:03:35,620 --> 04:03:37,139
You don't have to do anything.

2160
04:03:38,889 --> 04:03:40,809
You can walk around with an unconscious dog

2161
04:03:40,809 --> 04:03:42,889
and look for weird shit to stare at.

2162
04:03:42,889 --> 04:03:44,489
Or you can build a city.

2163
04:03:46,969 --> 04:03:48,090
It's kind of just up to you.

2164
04:03:48,729 --> 04:03:53,530
You could go searching for demons in the northwest.

2165
04:03:53,530 --> 04:04:00,069
Well, you're now turned into a rug of a dog somehow.

2166
04:04:00,790 --> 04:04:03,829
Which is terrible.

2167
04:04:04,469 --> 04:04:08,920
Because look at them.

2168
04:04:14,420 --> 04:04:15,139
Breed the dog.

2169
04:04:23,719 --> 04:04:25,159
Let's take a second here.

2170
04:04:25,799 --> 04:04:27,020
All right, who just ate?

2171
04:04:27,020 --> 04:04:27,659
105.

2172
04:04:28,299 --> 04:04:29,340
How much more food do I have?

2173
04:04:31,100 --> 04:04:31,659
Not enough.

2174
04:04:31,659 --> 04:04:33,739
But it's probably enough to get to the next area.

2175
04:04:35,909 --> 04:04:37,670
You could be a slave for two hours, yeah?

2176
04:04:38,309 --> 04:04:40,899
That's exactly what happened to the very forgetting.

2177
04:04:44,659 --> 04:04:46,180
That character didn't even have an arm.

2178
04:04:46,819 --> 04:04:48,629
So it was even harder.

2179
04:04:48,629 --> 04:04:51,209
All right, let me prospect here.

2180
04:04:51,209 --> 04:04:54,100
What do we got?

2181
04:04:54,100 --> 04:04:54,600
Stone.

2182
04:04:58,500 --> 04:04:59,000
Hmm.

2183
04:05:02,600 --> 04:05:03,100
Stone.

2184
04:05:03,719 --> 04:05:06,139
You guys see any stone?

2185
04:05:09,530 --> 04:05:10,170
Water.

2186
04:05:10,170 --> 04:05:10,670
Stone.

2187
04:05:13,719 --> 04:05:19,420
Hmm.

2188
04:05:19,420 --> 04:05:21,340
I mean, there's stones all around me,

2189
04:05:21,340 --> 04:05:23,659
but I don't know if it's worth stopping for.

2190
04:05:31,479 --> 04:05:35,610
Well, all right, we're going all the way up this discovered holy farm.

2191
04:05:36,250 --> 04:05:39,739
Can you fall off?

2192
04:05:40,459 --> 04:05:43,350
I should probably be really careful here.

2193
04:05:44,069 --> 04:05:49,000
Where am I now?

2194
04:05:49,559 --> 04:05:51,930
I'm up on the mountain.

2195
04:05:58,709 --> 04:06:00,549
Put on a chill OST.

2196
04:06:00,549 --> 04:06:01,190
All right, fine.

2197
04:06:01,829 --> 04:06:03,579
That sounds like a good idea.

2198
04:06:03,579 --> 04:06:08,329
How about, uh, what's a good, like, chill?

2199
04:06:09,670 --> 04:06:10,309
Not doom.

2200
04:06:19,290 --> 04:06:20,010
Earthbound?

2201
04:06:21,399 --> 04:06:22,920
Earthbound OST doesn't sound bad.

2202
04:06:30,940 --> 04:06:31,440
What?

2203
04:06:31,579 --> 04:06:32,299
That was not me.

2204
04:06:32,299 --> 04:06:32,780
I didn't do that.

2205
04:06:32,780 --> 04:06:33,579
That was the soundtrack.

2206
04:06:33,579 --> 04:06:35,100
That was the earthbound soundtrack.

2207
04:06:35,100 --> 04:06:45,930
All right, this looks good.

2208
04:06:46,489 --> 04:06:50,569
What do you mean sure?

2209
04:06:50,569 --> 04:06:51,129
Look, listen.

2210
04:06:53,989 --> 04:06:54,709
See?

2211
04:06:54,709 --> 04:06:58,409
Different things that I'm doing that.

2212
04:06:58,409 --> 04:07:07,530
I think I just crashed my browser by doing that too.

2213
04:07:07,530 --> 04:07:08,809
Oh, what the fuck am I doing?

2214
04:07:09,450 --> 04:07:13,049
Hey, there we go.

2215
04:07:13,049 --> 04:07:13,549
Let's go.

2216
04:07:21,989 --> 04:07:31,579
How you doing, dog?

2217
04:07:40,059 --> 04:08:00,649
Is this earthbound or is this toe jamming, Earl?

2218
04:08:00,649 --> 04:08:01,370
Nowhere.

2219
04:08:01,370 --> 04:08:05,850
Holy shit.

2220
04:08:05,850 --> 04:08:06,329
Where am I?

2221
04:08:06,329 --> 04:08:07,049
Where do I go?

2222
04:08:07,049 --> 04:08:08,409
I don't have much food.

2223
04:08:08,409 --> 04:08:09,979
I only have like three.

2224
04:08:09,979 --> 04:08:11,260
Oh, no, two.

2225
04:08:11,260 --> 04:08:14,280
And the dog's not even ready.

2226
04:08:14,280 --> 04:08:16,889
Oh, what's this?

2227
04:08:16,889 --> 04:08:25,639
Materials?

2228
04:08:25,639 --> 04:08:26,920
What can I do with this?

2229
04:08:26,920 --> 04:08:36,379
I don't think I can do anything with this.

2230
04:08:36,379 --> 04:08:38,219
I don't think I have the necessary tool for this.

2231
04:08:38,219 --> 04:08:45,819
No, nothing here.

2232
04:08:47,530 --> 04:08:49,690
Dog's not ready to walk on his own.

2233
04:08:53,979 --> 04:08:55,739
Oh, got to camp.

2234
04:08:55,739 --> 04:08:59,879
That will take me to Wizard, Wizard.

2235
04:08:59,879 --> 04:09:02,360
It was the river.

2236
04:09:08,090 --> 04:09:08,809
Let's head that way.

2237
04:09:10,409 --> 04:09:11,129
Kill the dog.

2238
04:09:14,709 --> 04:09:16,149
I can't just kill the dog.

2239
04:09:17,209 --> 04:09:19,690
You understand the last three hours or no,

2240
04:09:19,690 --> 04:09:20,969
probably like two hours of this game,

2241
04:09:21,530 --> 04:09:23,620
has been making sure this dog stays alive.

2242
04:09:30,409 --> 04:09:32,250
Let the dog go on a spy mission to camp.

2243
04:09:32,250 --> 04:09:33,850
The dog can't even walk.

2244
04:09:36,459 --> 04:09:40,780
So, that's not going to happen.

2245
04:09:40,780 --> 04:09:48,979
That's a long way down.

2246
04:09:49,620 --> 04:09:53,350
I'm going to get jumped over here or something, aren't I?

2247
04:09:55,620 --> 04:09:56,180
What?

2248
04:09:56,180 --> 04:09:58,250
What the hell was that?

2249
04:09:58,889 --> 04:10:00,620
That was weird.

2250
04:10:00,620 --> 04:10:01,120
Okay.

2251
04:10:04,620 --> 04:10:05,579
Some more materials.

2252
04:10:06,459 --> 04:10:10,790
He can walk now, but I don't want him to.

2253
04:10:10,790 --> 04:10:13,370
I want him to get to at least halfway.

2254
04:10:13,370 --> 04:10:14,329
I don't want him to use energy.

2255
04:10:15,209 --> 04:10:16,969
Let me use the energy for him.

2256
04:10:16,969 --> 04:10:23,030
Okay, a few more things to look at up here.

2257
04:10:25,860 --> 04:10:26,500
Prospect.

2258
04:10:35,079 --> 04:10:35,559
Never mind.

2259
04:10:37,979 --> 04:10:38,860
Ooh, what's that?

2260
04:10:44,760 --> 04:10:45,559
Something over here.

2261
04:10:46,120 --> 04:10:51,750
I wish I could just throw him in the basket.

2262
04:10:53,079 --> 04:10:54,200
No, I kind of do too.

2263
04:11:02,010 --> 04:11:03,290
How am I going to get down here?

2264
04:11:03,290 --> 04:11:05,290
I went up so far all the way to the top.

2265
04:11:06,329 --> 04:11:07,690
Why did I go on the mountain?

2266
04:11:07,690 --> 04:11:08,809
I'm not even ready for this.

2267
04:11:14,819 --> 04:11:17,059
I have to drop the dog to interact with things.

2268
04:11:17,059 --> 04:11:17,700
Oh god.

2269
04:11:18,579 --> 04:11:24,549
You're going to be okay?

2270
04:11:37,079 --> 04:11:38,040
Are you all right?

2271
04:11:38,040 --> 04:11:39,659
How come you're not walking with me?

2272
04:11:42,899 --> 04:11:43,299
With me.

2273
04:11:43,299 --> 04:11:43,700
Come on.

2274
04:11:43,700 --> 04:11:44,100
Let's go.

2275
04:11:44,659 --> 04:11:55,260
No, this is material.

2276
04:11:55,260 --> 04:11:57,540
Is it copper?

2277
04:12:00,280 --> 04:12:00,600
Copper.

2278
04:12:01,159 --> 04:12:07,590
The dog passed out again.

2279
04:12:07,590 --> 04:12:07,989
No.

2280
04:12:07,989 --> 04:12:09,110
Why are you not staying with me?

2281
04:12:17,459 --> 04:12:18,260
Get me a copper.

2282
04:12:22,219 --> 04:12:23,420
We consider any...

2283
04:12:26,069 --> 04:12:26,629
Oh yeah, that's right.

2284
04:12:26,629 --> 04:12:28,229
It doesn't have the job anymore, right?

2285
04:12:28,229 --> 04:12:31,270
I need to do a sign.

2286
04:12:32,469 --> 04:12:32,870
Follow.

2287
04:12:38,120 --> 04:12:38,520
Jobs.

2288
04:12:47,700 --> 04:12:48,500
Answer the door.

2289
04:12:49,139 --> 04:12:49,989
What door?

2290
04:12:51,420 --> 04:12:51,659
Okay.

2291
04:12:57,020 --> 04:12:57,659
Okay, good.

2292
04:12:58,299 --> 04:13:06,889
I actually remember this part of the game.

2293
04:13:06,889 --> 04:13:09,450
It scared the shit out of me when I first played it.

2294
04:13:09,450 --> 04:13:15,139
This copper is shitty quality.

2295
04:13:16,340 --> 04:13:17,219
The other one was too.

2296
04:13:17,940 --> 04:13:22,280
I don't have enough food to mine here.

2297
04:13:24,329 --> 04:13:25,049
Oh, fuck.

2298
04:13:25,690 --> 04:13:28,569
The dog ate the last piece of bread.

2299
04:13:28,569 --> 04:13:30,020
Or whatever the hell it was.

2300
04:13:30,020 --> 04:13:30,979
I gotta get out of here, you're right.

2301
04:13:30,979 --> 04:13:31,459
I gotta go.

2302
04:13:33,190 --> 04:13:34,469
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2303
04:13:35,110 --> 04:13:36,149
I guess I'll get one.

2304
04:13:36,149 --> 04:13:36,309
Go.

2305
04:13:39,780 --> 04:13:41,620
There's gotta be the kind of town here.

2306
04:13:41,620 --> 04:13:42,260
There has to be.

2307
04:13:43,059 --> 04:13:46,219
Come on.

2308
04:13:46,860 --> 04:13:52,340
Go, go, go, go.

2309
04:13:53,139 --> 04:13:55,879
All right.

2310
04:13:55,879 --> 04:13:56,280
We're out.

2311
04:14:00,739 --> 04:14:03,850
Take a town or something.

2312
04:14:04,649 --> 04:14:08,149
I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere.

2313
04:14:08,870 --> 04:14:10,920
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

2314
04:14:11,799 --> 04:14:20,540
The dog is so slow.

2315
04:14:22,200 --> 04:14:22,600
All right.

2316
04:14:22,600 --> 04:14:23,639
Pick up the dog again.

2317
04:14:23,879 --> 04:14:24,680
I'm sorry.

2318
04:14:24,680 --> 04:14:25,479
I gotta pick you up.

2319
04:14:27,719 --> 04:14:28,520
I gotta run.

2320
04:14:28,520 --> 04:14:30,040
Look at how much faster I am than you.

2321
04:14:30,040 --> 04:14:30,440
Let's go.

2322
04:14:31,159 --> 04:14:37,270
I'm not stopping for anything.

2323
04:14:38,420 --> 04:14:40,819
I just gotta make it down the other side of the mountain.

2324
04:14:43,690 --> 04:14:44,569
Is this early access?

2325
04:14:44,569 --> 04:14:44,809
Nope.

2326
04:14:45,879 --> 04:14:47,079
Game is out.

2327
04:14:47,079 --> 04:14:47,799
It has released.

2328
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:53,100
This is a released video game.

2329
04:15:00,459 --> 04:15:02,840
Can I even get down from here?

2330
04:15:03,479 --> 04:15:06,280
Yep, I can.

2331
04:15:06,280 --> 04:15:06,680
Right here.

2332
04:15:10,040 --> 04:15:12,520
Down, around, and then come on.

2333
04:15:12,520 --> 04:15:13,479
Is this a house over here?

2334
04:15:15,750 --> 04:15:16,149
Something.

2335
04:15:16,149 --> 04:15:16,629
A house.

2336
04:15:16,629 --> 04:15:17,110
A hut.

2337
04:15:17,110 --> 04:15:17,670
A village.

2338
04:15:18,870 --> 04:15:19,750
A small group.

2339
04:15:20,309 --> 04:15:28,250
When did it get released?

2340
04:15:28,250 --> 04:15:29,129
10 years ago.

2341
04:15:31,850 --> 04:15:32,569
I don't think so.

2342
04:15:33,129 --> 04:15:37,530
Okay.

2343
04:15:37,530 --> 04:15:38,649
Dog's hungry again.

2344
04:15:39,450 --> 04:15:40,250
Although so am I.

2345
04:15:41,049 --> 04:15:43,420
Let's go.

2346
04:15:43,420 --> 04:15:43,979
Pick up pace.

2347
04:15:44,780 --> 04:15:57,750
We didn't even scratch the surface of this area, too.

2348
04:15:58,549 --> 04:16:01,290
It's been in development for 10 years.

2349
04:16:03,610 --> 04:16:03,850
Wow.

2350
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:12,120
That's a passion project, for sure.

2351
04:16:17,430 --> 04:16:18,549
There was a camp over here.

2352
04:16:22,340 --> 04:16:23,459
Give me some points of interest.

2353
04:16:23,459 --> 04:16:24,180
Oh, fuck.

2354
04:16:24,180 --> 04:16:24,659
Who are you?

2355
04:16:25,540 --> 04:16:27,209
Holy servants.

2356
04:16:27,209 --> 04:16:27,850
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

2357
04:16:27,850 --> 04:16:28,489
Maybe they'll help me.

2358
04:16:29,049 --> 04:16:34,569
Do you guys have anything?

2359
04:16:34,569 --> 04:16:35,370
You need rations?

2360
04:16:36,090 --> 04:16:37,719
I got a sick dog.

2361
04:16:40,729 --> 04:16:41,930
Anybody here I can talk to?

2362
04:16:42,569 --> 04:16:50,229
No, I'm going the wrong way.

2363
04:16:50,229 --> 04:16:50,950
I gotta go this way.

2364
04:16:51,510 --> 04:16:54,069
Past the river.

2365
04:16:59,930 --> 04:17:00,409
But okay.

2366
04:17:01,540 --> 04:17:02,260
I got...

2367
04:17:02,260 --> 04:17:03,459
I'm not starving.

2368
04:17:03,459 --> 04:17:04,420
I'm normal.

2369
04:17:04,420 --> 04:17:11,909
Supplies and stuff I can't stop for.

2370
04:17:12,549 --> 04:17:16,420
I was gonna make it to the other side of the river and I'll be fine.

2371
04:17:23,879 --> 04:17:24,920
No discoveries.

2372
04:17:25,479 --> 04:17:27,979
The hat...

2373
04:17:27,979 --> 04:17:28,700
Look at the...

2374
04:17:28,700 --> 04:17:29,579
What could be right here?

2375
04:17:29,579 --> 04:17:30,459
There has to be some...

2376
04:17:30,459 --> 04:17:31,260
Wend, okay?

2377
04:17:32,139 --> 04:17:34,170
The city of Wend.

2378
04:17:34,729 --> 04:17:49,180
Where's the dog?

2379
04:17:49,739 --> 04:17:56,149
Did I lose the dog?

2380
04:18:05,899 --> 04:18:06,379
Bounty.

2381
04:18:07,719 --> 04:18:07,959
What?

2382
04:18:11,799 --> 04:18:12,280
Knife.

2383
04:18:12,280 --> 04:18:13,000
Skeletons.

2384
04:18:14,489 --> 04:18:14,969
Heart.

2385
04:18:14,969 --> 04:18:15,610
Skeletons.

2386
04:18:23,530 --> 04:18:24,250
Uh...

2387
04:18:24,250 --> 04:18:27,510
I'm just gonna keep going this way.

2388
04:18:28,469 --> 04:18:31,940
I know the music is clashing.

2389
04:18:32,819 --> 04:18:43,239
I'm in good spirits and I do have a weapon.

2390
04:18:43,239 --> 04:18:43,879
So I'm not...

2391
04:18:44,440 --> 04:18:45,159
I'm not afraid.

2392
04:18:51,700 --> 04:18:52,420
Something up here.

2393
04:18:53,299 --> 04:18:56,280
We're just gonna go right into the crater.

2394
04:18:57,079 --> 04:19:10,680
You wanna play Mongolian throat singing?

2395
04:19:10,680 --> 04:19:14,549
No, we got earthbound on right now.

2396
04:19:14,549 --> 04:19:15,750
I love this OST.

2397
04:19:15,750 --> 04:19:16,389
O-S-T.

2398
04:19:20,360 --> 04:19:21,239
This is soundtrack.

2399
04:19:22,120 --> 04:19:29,239
Is there a town?

2400
04:19:29,239 --> 04:19:29,559
Camp?

2401
04:19:31,139 --> 04:19:32,340
Discovered holy farm.

2402
04:19:34,420 --> 04:19:34,659
What?

2403
04:19:35,379 --> 04:19:36,579
No, I didn't.

2404
04:19:37,299 --> 04:19:39,079
I'm in the crater.

2405
04:19:45,719 --> 04:19:46,040
Fuck.

2406
04:19:46,600 --> 04:19:49,219
All right.

2407
04:19:49,219 --> 04:19:49,860
Holy farm.

2408
04:19:53,819 --> 04:19:55,819
If I have to steal, I'm gonna steal.

2409
04:19:55,819 --> 04:19:57,180
You know?

2410
04:19:57,180 --> 04:19:58,920
Look, there's a couple of houses here.

2411
04:19:58,920 --> 04:20:00,440
I'm gonna be friendly, introduce myself.

2412
04:20:01,000 --> 04:20:11,100
The dog?

2413
04:20:11,100 --> 04:20:11,819
Dog's all right.

2414
04:20:11,819 --> 04:20:12,780
Just hungry.

2415
04:20:12,780 --> 04:20:21,750
Okay, I'm about to pass the sludge river.

2416
04:20:21,750 --> 04:20:34,299
Be friendly, introduce myself, and then steal everything.

2417
04:20:34,299 --> 04:20:36,459
Well, what do you want me to do?

2418
04:20:37,100 --> 04:20:38,459
We're kind of desperate right now.

2419
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:42,629
Are those...

2420
04:20:42,629 --> 04:20:43,110
What are those?

2421
04:20:43,110 --> 04:20:43,430
Dogs?

2422
04:20:44,149 --> 04:20:47,020
Oh, got food for days here, guys.

2423
04:20:47,739 --> 04:21:09,399
Okay.

2424
04:21:09,399 --> 04:21:10,120
Let me take a look.

2425
04:21:10,680 --> 04:21:11,670
This is easy.

2426
04:21:11,670 --> 04:21:12,469
This is like a pig.

2427
04:21:12,469 --> 04:21:16,360
Oh no, that's just another dog.

2428
04:21:16,360 --> 04:21:18,120
Can I trade my dog for this dog?

2429
04:21:18,120 --> 04:21:19,540
This dog's healthy.

2430
04:21:19,540 --> 04:21:24,649
Okay.

2431
04:21:28,059 --> 04:21:28,620
Anybody here?

2432
04:21:28,620 --> 04:21:29,100
What's this?

2433
04:21:29,899 --> 04:21:30,459
Outhouse.

2434
04:21:31,180 --> 04:21:40,389
Am I actually using it?

2435
04:21:41,110 --> 04:21:43,750
Is this helping anything?

2436
04:21:43,750 --> 04:21:48,860
Is that...

2437
04:21:48,860 --> 04:21:49,819
Oh, a bed.

2438
04:21:49,819 --> 04:21:51,700
All right, I'm gonna put him in the bed.

2439
04:21:55,510 --> 04:21:56,229
You just relax.

2440
04:21:57,180 --> 04:21:58,139
Stay there.

2441
04:21:58,139 --> 04:22:01,450
Stay.

2442
04:22:03,139 --> 04:22:03,620
Stay there.

2443
04:22:04,360 --> 04:22:05,000
Look good.

2444
04:22:05,000 --> 04:22:05,559
Lie down.

2445
04:22:06,200 --> 04:22:07,139
Relax.

2446
04:22:07,139 --> 04:22:08,819
I'm gonna try to find us some food.

2447
04:22:08,819 --> 04:22:18,059
All right, I'm gonna knock on the door.

2448
04:22:18,860 --> 04:22:24,020
Stormhouse door.

2449
04:22:24,020 --> 04:22:24,260
Open.

2450
04:22:25,059 --> 04:22:26,790
I mean, do I have to knock?

2451
04:22:27,430 --> 04:22:35,799
Is anybody even in here?

2452
04:22:36,360 --> 04:22:44,059
There's nobody in here.

2453
04:22:44,620 --> 04:23:08,200
Steal...

2454
04:23:08,200 --> 04:23:10,040
Oh man, look at the price.

2455
04:23:10,840 --> 04:23:12,920
Look at the price on these.

2456
04:23:12,920 --> 04:23:18,260
Look, it's the apocalypse.

2457
04:23:18,260 --> 04:23:19,940
Oh, hey, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

2458
04:23:19,940 --> 04:23:23,059
Out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds, out of bounds.

2459
04:23:23,059 --> 04:23:23,620
Bye, bye.

2460
04:23:23,620 --> 04:23:24,420
See you later.

2461
04:23:24,420 --> 04:23:25,930
Out of bounds.

2462
04:23:25,930 --> 04:23:26,329
I just need...

2463
04:23:26,329 --> 04:23:27,690
My dog needed help.

2464
04:23:27,690 --> 04:23:31,979
All right.

2465
04:23:31,979 --> 04:23:33,020
Where's my dog?

2466
04:23:33,020 --> 04:23:35,020
Did you have any food in there?

2467
04:23:35,579 --> 04:23:42,010
If I get to a town, I can sell that shit and then make a lot of money.

2468
04:23:48,729 --> 04:23:49,370
I'm gonna keep...

2469
04:23:49,370 --> 04:23:50,329
Dog is gonna stay there.

2470
04:23:50,889 --> 04:23:52,010
There's another house over here.

2471
04:23:52,010 --> 04:23:53,129
I'm hoping to get some food.

2472
04:23:53,690 --> 04:24:06,260
Okay, let's start walking.

2473
04:24:09,799 --> 04:24:10,200
Sneak.

2474
04:24:11,159 --> 04:24:14,280
Get this fucking door open.

2475
04:24:23,370 --> 04:24:24,889
Texas, smash the door.

2476
04:24:24,889 --> 04:24:33,850
Kill if you must.

2477
04:24:33,850 --> 04:24:34,569
Only if I have to.

2478
04:24:35,290 --> 04:24:37,819
All right, it's daytime.

2479
04:24:37,819 --> 04:24:39,100
Someone's gonna come out of this door.

2480
04:24:41,899 --> 04:24:43,420
Someone's gonna open the door.

2481
04:24:43,420 --> 04:24:51,739
Wait, can I stand over here?

2482
04:24:51,739 --> 04:24:52,780
He watches my here?

2483
04:24:52,780 --> 04:24:53,899
No, somebody just said that.

2484
04:24:58,200 --> 04:25:06,340
Does anybody live here?

2485
04:25:06,340 --> 04:25:17,350
You can get this door.

2486
04:25:17,350 --> 04:25:23,399
There's probably a fridge in here.

2487
04:25:23,399 --> 04:25:25,370
There's probably snacks.

2488
04:25:25,370 --> 04:25:26,250
There's probably food.

2489
04:25:26,250 --> 04:25:27,049
There's probably water.

2490
04:25:27,610 --> 04:25:29,370
I just have to get the...

2491
04:25:29,370 --> 04:25:30,809
Okay, let's knock it out and not just walk out.

2492
04:25:30,809 --> 04:25:31,450
No, I didn't open it.

2493
04:25:31,450 --> 04:25:32,489
Somebody else did.

2494
04:25:32,489 --> 04:25:33,129
All right.

2495
04:25:33,129 --> 04:25:35,370
If I reset the intelligence, it'll think that I did...

2496
04:25:35,370 --> 04:25:36,250
You know what I mean?

2497
04:25:36,250 --> 04:25:36,649
So now...

2498
04:25:36,649 --> 04:25:38,170
Oh, I just came up here and the door was open.

2499
04:25:38,809 --> 04:25:54,940
Person to sleep.

2500
04:25:54,940 --> 04:25:56,139
I'm gonna steal everything from their body.

2501
04:25:58,229 --> 04:25:59,190
First aid.

2502
04:25:59,190 --> 04:26:00,010
Splint kit.

2503
04:26:00,649 --> 04:26:16,569
But was it even worth coming in here?

2504
04:26:16,569 --> 04:26:18,010
They don't even have any food in here.

2505
04:26:18,010 --> 04:26:18,889
They got meat.

2506
04:26:18,889 --> 04:26:19,610
They have raw meat.

2507
04:26:19,610 --> 04:26:20,170
They got fish.

2508
04:26:20,170 --> 04:26:20,889
Yeah, it was...

2509
04:26:20,889 --> 04:26:31,620
Fucking fit somebody.

2510
04:26:33,850 --> 04:26:34,809
What the fuck?

2511
04:26:35,450 --> 04:26:36,659
Am I honest?

2512
04:26:36,659 --> 04:26:37,780
Is this a move I'm doing?

2513
04:26:39,030 --> 04:26:40,309
How did you pick me up?

2514
04:26:51,219 --> 04:26:53,379
I thought I was doing that.

2515
04:26:54,569 --> 04:26:54,969
No.

2516
04:26:54,969 --> 04:26:55,770
What the fuck?

2517
04:26:56,870 --> 04:26:57,430
No, I...

2518
04:26:58,069 --> 04:27:06,969
I'm breaking in now.

2519
04:27:08,020 --> 04:27:10,549
You can call me a safe scum or all you want.

2520
04:27:10,549 --> 04:27:11,270
It's nighttime.

2521
04:27:11,270 --> 04:27:13,670
I'm getting in there and I'm taking the dried fish and the raw meat.

2522
04:27:18,139 --> 04:27:19,739
I'm breaking this door open.

2523
04:27:19,739 --> 04:27:20,780
They're sleeping.

2524
04:27:20,780 --> 04:27:21,739
It's not gonna be daytime.

2525
04:27:21,739 --> 04:27:22,219
I'll get it.

2526
04:27:22,780 --> 04:27:30,120
Get it open.

2527
04:27:30,120 --> 04:27:30,840
First try.

2528
04:27:30,840 --> 04:27:31,559
First try.

2529
04:27:31,559 --> 04:27:32,040
No, I didn't.

2530
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:32,680
Did I not get it?

2531
04:27:39,510 --> 04:27:41,750
I just need to get in there, grab the dried fish, and get out.

2532
04:27:42,389 --> 04:27:43,909
Okay, got it.

2533
04:27:43,909 --> 04:27:44,469
Save the game.

2534
04:27:45,030 --> 04:27:46,020
Save the game.

2535
04:27:46,739 --> 04:27:52,329
Okay, get in.

2536
04:27:52,329 --> 04:28:00,280
It's not even in the same place.

2537
04:28:01,590 --> 04:28:02,950
Okay, get out, get out, get out.

2538
04:28:03,510 --> 04:28:10,090
No, I ate it.

2539
04:28:10,090 --> 04:28:11,129
I didn't want to eat it.

2540
04:28:15,930 --> 04:28:16,489

2541
04:28:16,489 --> 04:28:27,780

3206
07:06:22,040 --> 07:06:28,650
of turned into this i'm probably going to change this by the way well i fucked it up

3207
07:06:29,689 --> 07:06:35,020
uh so that by the way in case you're wondering germa expensive is going to

3208
07:06:35,020 --> 07:06:49,669
become a base emote and it's going to be changed into a germa one guy that fits more as one guy

3209
07:06:49,669 --> 07:07:02,650
than it does as expensive in my opinion so that'll be that's going to become a base emote and

3210
07:07:02,650 --> 07:07:09,580
then i don't know what i'm going to do for the 20 the 25 sub is just like it's that's

3211
07:07:09,580 --> 07:07:20,659
a that's so much i'll put like i'm gonna put like an x there which one guy told you to do

3212
07:07:20,659 --> 07:07:26,180
that um it might even been in the discord maybe this maybe one guy said it in the discord that

3213
07:07:26,180 --> 07:07:36,169
it would be like good i don't know i'm sure one guy told me to do that don't worry hey duke duke

3214
07:07:36,169 --> 07:07:41,930

3216
07:07:49,369 --> 07:07:53,290

3217
07:07:54,090 --> 07:08:00,340
sleeping in a little bed that i made for him but uh you were watching kenshi

3218
07:08:02,020 --> 07:08:09,700
it is a pretty wild game but one that i currently think is fun to do uh thank you so much duke i'm

3219
07:08:09,700 --> 07:08:17,380
not sure when you leave but good luck when you do i'm not sure what the date you're leaving

3220
07:08:22,580 --> 07:08:31,830
the link i sent broke well that's not good show us the dog no he's eating but thank you

3222
07:08:43,909 --> 07:08:50,790
incredibly kind of you smelly but we demand the dog vessel no i he's down there he's get

3223
07:08:50,790 --> 07:08:55,990
there's a piece of meat in front of him when he gets up from no now that's like a bad

3224
07:08:55,990 --> 07:08:59,669
never mind because i was that implies that he's like down there lying down

3225
07:09:00,229 --> 07:09:04,229
no because i was making a reference to the stream dog i told you i didn't want that

3226
07:09:04,229 --> 07:09:09,720
dog to be auto i don't want that dog connected to auto at all so that's not what's going to

3227
07:09:09,720 --> 07:09:18,709
happen the auto is doing just fine downstairs eating his dinner dog food thank you smelly

3228
07:09:18,709 --> 07:09:23,990
boy for the one dollar even given uh ever given thought to playing any of those combat strategy

3229
07:09:23,990 --> 07:09:33,369
games like total war sieve nice try or mountain blade uh would be fun to watch you try those

3230
07:09:33,369 --> 07:09:47,770
um not really not really mountain blade is something that's requested a lot total war

3231
07:09:47,770 --> 07:09:52,330
seems cool because you have 10 000 units on the screen at the same time might be fun to make a

3232
07:09:52,330 --> 07:10:01,610
custom map or something no those are not for germa those are not nice try he tried he wrote

3233
07:10:02,330 --> 07:10:10,709
of word here and he thought i was going to stumble over and just say it almost you need

3234
07:10:10,709 --> 07:10:15,270
fast paced games for this boomer what about the game we've played to the one that i was

3235
07:10:15,270 --> 07:10:21,060
just on tonight that's a fast paced game people were screaming at me when i was mining

3236
07:10:26,840 --> 07:10:32,360
i was trying to slow it down and everybody in chat is like excuse me sir would you please step

3237
07:10:32,360 --> 07:10:49,220
on the gas and hold it down until you touch the floor no i i look listen this this game

3238
07:10:49,220 --> 07:10:53,220
i know has like a lot of people that are big fans and that probably spent a lot of time in

3239
07:10:53,220 --> 07:11:01,419
it and it's fucking awesome because it seems like a great game i i get it i understand

3240
07:11:02,220 --> 07:11:10,970
but i need to like mine the dumb ore to make enough money to buy the dog food

3241
07:11:11,770 --> 07:11:22,490
you know what i'm saying but thank you smelly boy thank you keldos for the one dollar italics

3242
07:11:22,490 --> 07:11:42,419
did a great job with the effects hashtag charity oh yeah it's fucking i loved it so if

3243
07:11:42,419 --> 07:11:49,240
you're curious about that um i loaded up a shitload of sound effects and music files

3244
07:11:51,139 --> 07:11:56,819
and they were just on a button press and i'm like hey dude you have full just creative control

3245
07:11:57,700 --> 07:12:02,099
he's like you're gonna give me full creative he's like i have full creative control i'm like dude

3246
07:12:02,099 --> 07:12:09,240
yeah do whatever the fuck you want except obviously like the the voice changer was there

3247
07:12:09,240 --> 07:12:14,500
for bugleberry i mean both like voice changer as in like you know that's his real voice

3248
07:12:16,700 --> 07:12:25,459
what software is it it's a stream deck yeah the placement on a lot of those sound clips

3249
07:12:25,939 --> 07:12:33,080
fucking perfect explain that clip what's wrong with this one

3250
07:12:42,330 --> 07:12:46,409
i mean it's a voice changer so i'm sorry he pressed a button that was called like distortion

3251
07:12:46,409 --> 07:12:54,569
effect i would if you look closely we look at my mouth i say i say hey and for some reason

3252
07:12:54,569 --> 07:12:57,930
he pressed the button at the right exact time to distort it and added like a monster effect

3253
07:12:57,930 --> 07:13:13,099
to it i would hey yeah so i mean that's the explanation for that but if you remember

3254
07:13:13,099 --> 07:13:20,409
what the first time bugleberry was on stream that i didn't have a like stream deck i was

3255
07:13:20,409 --> 07:13:24,889
opening up random tabs to have scream noises and stuff so it was so much more seamless

3256
07:13:24,889 --> 07:13:30,169
for him just to have a fully loaded board with sound effects for him just to do it

3257
07:13:30,169 --> 07:13:37,909
whenever he wanted to so no i i watched that stream back and i had a lot of fun it was kind

3258
07:13:37,909 --> 07:13:45,529
of hectic though because we had to build up and take down essentially a random bunch of stuff

3259
07:13:45,529 --> 07:13:53,130
that we put in the way and we had to be out out at the lock out of the studio no ifs

3260
07:13:53,130 --> 07:14:00,009
ands or buts we had to be out at 9 p.m so there was no oh can we like stay no we had

3261
07:14:00,009 --> 07:14:05,459
to clean up and shit so if you're wondering why that stream had to be kind of done after three

3262
07:14:05,459 --> 07:14:16,119
hours is because of that boomer watches his own streams well i wanted to make i wanted to make

3263
07:14:16,119 --> 07:14:28,090
sure it went all right i mean that was you know it was kind of an ordeal how long did

3264
07:14:28,090 --> 07:14:37,029
it take to clean uh we cleaned up real real quick it took about three or four straight

3265
07:14:37,110 --> 07:14:42,549
hours to put it all up and then it took about when you get locked in just disassemble put

3266
07:14:42,549 --> 07:14:47,990
everything in boxes get it out it's probably like an hour and a half maybe hour right when

3267
07:14:47,990 --> 07:14:54,459
the stream turned off we got going but i'm glad people thought it was fun i had a lot of fun

3268
07:14:55,939 --> 07:15:00,099
i have a lot of uh because i wanted to see the chat too you know i didn't get to see

3269
07:15:00,099 --> 07:15:05,099
the chat for the most of the entire stream and it's fun to kind of go back and see what

3270
07:15:05,099 --> 07:15:08,139
you know i wanted to see what you guys are saying i think it's fun you guys are saying

and i talked about how shitty they were and how it was the worst product ever because

3286
07:17:09,819 --> 07:17:13,259
you can't replace the battery you have to like get you have to like sign up for their

3287
07:17:13,259 --> 07:17:18,360
subscription program because when they die you can't replace a battery you have to like hey

3288
07:17:18,360 --> 07:17:27,740
give me some new ones send but i need to buy new ones now right uh um they have batteries

3289
07:17:27,740 --> 07:17:38,069
now tile now has batteries that you can replace i wonder who got that to happen

3290
07:17:47,290 --> 07:17:54,409
now i had like i probably had fucking nothing to do with it but uh tile now has a battery of

3291
07:17:54,409 --> 07:18:09,799
a replaceable battery so i got new tile for christmas you were the only person to ever

3292
07:18:09,799 --> 07:18:19,240
complain about that i i know right imagine if i was that much of like a fucking eagle maniac

3293
07:18:19,959 --> 07:18:33,659
that i really thought that that was why there are 60 billion people in america and like one

3294
07:18:33,659 --> 07:18:48,139
person that just has like you know a few thousand people hanging out no what if the president of

3295
07:18:48,139 --> 07:18:54,169
tile tweeted at you i'd be like um that your products are great they're really like i just

3296
07:18:54,169 --> 07:18:59,610
like flew off the handle one night because like i might i lost my keys and i couldn't find them

3297
07:18:59,610 --> 07:19:04,169
and the tile was dead and they say they have a one year oh up to one it's a one year

3298
07:19:04,169 --> 07:19:10,299
lifespan it was like six and a half months it was just bullshit two of the tiles that

3299
07:19:10,380 --> 07:19:15,580
me and kim both bought them and i think two of them would just gone dead after like seven months

3300
07:19:16,540 --> 07:19:29,049
and the other two lasted for a year but i digress i got new ones let's see i get i am

3334
07:23:59,700 --> 07:24:10,540
favorite stream of the year very too many um i don't i can't tell you i have too many streams

3335
07:24:10,540 --> 07:24:17,580
this year that i really really was like holy shit that i had a lot of fun i can't really

3336
07:24:17,580 --> 07:24:21,799
single any out what's the worst streams of the year i could probably tell you um

3337
07:24:22,599 --> 07:24:34,700
so what even what's the worst stream of the year don't sit labo no labo would be like in

3338
07:24:34,700 --> 07:24:53,740
the top five for me sorry uh this one carazam was not even this year the second hotline miami

3339
07:24:53,740 --> 07:25:08,950
2 stream no i it stressed us all out too much but that's the point of that game

3340
07:25:09,509 --> 07:25:12,470
the bird house would that would be i liked that stream i had a lot of fun

3341
07:25:14,090 --> 07:25:31,959
bird house was pretty bad what was wrong with the bird house bird house was easily the worst

3342
07:25:32,759 --> 07:25:45,110
yeah but that was too recent what about okay but besides the bird house

3343
07:25:51,860 --> 07:25:56,419
vampire was the worst stream yeah but was that because that was the worst stream or was because

3344
07:25:56,419 --> 07:26:08,340
that was like the worst game you know do am i at fault for that when a game is not that

3345
07:26:08,340 --> 07:26:25,819
great yes game okay all right all right i'm gonna have to tell you game review portable

3346
07:26:26,540 --> 07:26:34,659
uh dalek says i don't know if i agree with you the game review portable stream was i mean

3347
07:26:34,659 --> 07:26:49,400
awful but i liked it everyone forgot about immortal unchanged because it was so bad

3348
07:26:50,200 --> 07:27:01,669
i'll give you game review portable though because like that was so the whole i couldn't

3349
07:27:01,669 --> 07:27:07,259
get it captured yeah i'll say game review portable is probably the worst stream i did

3350
07:27:07,259 --> 07:27:14,229
all year i own it in a technical sense just like technically speaking that was probably

3351
07:27:14,229 --> 07:27:29,580
the worst stream i've ever done i thought that's true i liked that stream that's why i'm not sure

3352
07:27:29,580 --> 07:27:37,430
i agree with the game review portable pick here for worst stream of the year the minecraft stream

3353
07:27:37,430 --> 07:27:41,610
was bad yeah but does it count well it does it count if i was drunk you know what i mean

3354
07:27:42,840 --> 07:27:47,240
like if i'm like drunk and gonna play a game like does that count as like that was like a

3355
07:27:47,240 --> 07:27:56,470
10 minute drunk guy joke because that doesn't count as a stream that doesn't count you can't

3356
07:27:56,470 --> 07:28:01,669
okay you can't take a portion of one stream where like drunk guy plays minecraft for 20

3357
07:28:01,669 --> 07:28:14,250
minutes that's naughty that's that's a portion of a bigger stream the labo streams were

3358
07:28:14,250 --> 07:28:36,979
torture local streams stays drunk to excuse bad streams i've been drunk on stream like

3359
07:28:36,979 --> 07:28:56,340
four times ever in three years come on that's bullshit what like drunk on stream

3360
07:28:58,409 --> 07:29:07,450
that i what you did three labo streams that got drunk during all of them no what are you talking

3361
07:29:07,450 --> 07:29:16,840
about i got drunk on one of those labo streams one of them i was i was i was having some drinks

3362
07:29:16,840 --> 07:29:39,180

07:44:21,740 --> 07:44:26,060
to give me some garfin publicity and they didn't disappoint special thanks to italics for inviting

3459
07:44:26,060 --> 07:44:35,669
me into the stream here's some fun background info about that so um italics on my amazon

3460
07:44:36,950 --> 07:44:42,630
is the one that kim wrapped the gifts and italics is the one that made the order on

3461
07:44:42,630 --> 07:44:49,189
my amazon right so he made the order and i walked into the room after he told me yeah

3462
07:44:49,189 --> 07:44:54,869
you can come in i said okay hey so like i i'm like i wonder what's in there what kind of presents

3463
07:44:54,869 --> 07:44:58,869
oh some of them are kind of funny some of them are crazy i was like oh yeah i i can't wait

3464
07:44:58,869 --> 07:45:03,880
till the garfield costume comes out and he looked at me like what are you talking about

3465

like yeah you know the guaranteed absolute definite garfield costume i guarantee it's in

3466
07:45:08,439 --> 07:45:21,130
there here's the funny story it wasn't in there that suggestion was not used that was

3467
07:45:21,130 --> 07:45:33,500
added afterwards that had to have that was added after the fact because italics talked to

3468
07:45:34,299 --> 07:45:41,020
one of my mods a couple of them maybe i don't know exactly who he spoke to but they came to

3469
07:45:41,020 --> 07:45:52,060
the conclusion that um that it was to be added so that was originally not supposed to be

3470
07:45:52,060 --> 07:46:03,509
there i added yeah okay so it was it was grump that's so funny so originally it was

3471
07:46:03,509 --> 07:46:11,770
not supposed to be there but it is a little behind the scenes of the gift process and again

3472
07:46:11,770 --> 07:46:16,259
i don't i didn't really have much time to say it but if you had a suggestion or if you were

christmas season has honestly been quite stressful for me just want to ask how you stay motivated

3683
08:23:19,669 --> 08:23:27,060
hashtag charity uh well i'm sorry to hear that sorry here it's been stressful time holidays can

3684
08:23:27,060 --> 08:23:42,139
do that i would say best way to stay motivated is to try try to challenge yourself because

3685
08:23:42,139 --> 08:23:48,979
you give yourself something that if it takes it's gonna take a lot of work might take some

3686
08:23:48,979 --> 08:23:57,270
time but that's how i do it i stay motivated by trying to challenge myself and doesn't just mean

3687
08:23:58,069 --> 08:24:20,599
in like work or streams just in general it's a tricky thing though try to beat hotline miami

3688
08:24:20,599 --> 08:24:32,250
2 on stream it doesn't matter what you're talking about but motivation can be very difficult

3689
08:24:34,540 --> 08:24:40,889
and i get unmotivated sometimes it's hard sometimes it takes a lot to stay focused on

3690
08:24:40,889 --> 08:25:02,310
something did he like kenshi oh he loved it he loved kenshi sadly what what do you mean sadly

3691
08:25:03,819 --> 08:25:12,950
sadly oh no like oh great he likes it thank you c4g for the two dollars uh please

3692
08:25:13,590 --> 08:25:17,509
explain the plus two minus two meme to me i have a small brain i don't get it

3693
08:25:18,659 --> 08:25:25,060
well it's a meme that was killed that was banned forever if you if you weren't here

3694
08:25:25,060 --> 08:25:32,740
a few years ago a couple years ago back in 2017 i deleted i banned forever all the old memes

3695
08:25:32,740 --> 08:25:37,860
from the channel if you set them then you were gonna get timed out and uh it was there was a

3696
08:25:37,860 --> 08:25:44,970
revolt then there was a revive stream and then there was there was a well one of them got

3697
08:25:44,970 --> 08:25:48,650
to live and it had of course it's like the cryptocurrency one that's like just laughing in

3698
08:25:48,650 --> 08:25:55,049
my face of course the one meme that get got to stay the whole bald coin crypto thing well

3699
08:25:55,049 --> 08:26:13,659
that kind of well laugh it in my face now ain't it whoa whoa what the fuck was that but anyways

3700
08:26:13,659 --> 08:26:20,619
uh it means it's me getting points and losing points for saying something that people thought

3701
08:26:20,619 --> 08:26:26,220
was either really unfunny or that they thought was funny and sometimes people use it even when

3702
08:26:26,220 --> 08:26:29,740
i'm not attempting to make a joke sometimes i'll say i had like fucking corn flakes for

audience is in north america so catering to the north american audience and if you've you

3782

08:38:27,750 --> 08:38:36,979
might not be available it's just it's a it's a balancing act so it is it is hard to do
