1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:19,179
Okay, so, uh, someone want to link me a good one? What's a good one? This website has a shitload

2
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:31,739
of them, don't they? There's a lot on here. I haven't even eaten at half of these places.

3
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:43,670
Well, maybe, actually, maybe I have. Let me get it on screen. Give me a minute. Less than that.

4
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:05,030
Good old browser. Please capture the window, if you would. That would be nice. Are you not going

5
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:48,180
to capture my window here? Come on. This is going to be hard to do. Okay. All right. Looks

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:02:02,599
pretty good. Let me get back on screen here. All right. So, what am I supposed to do about this,

7
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:18,659
right? I'm supposed to... I drag these up into the front. Fast food. Okay, well, I'm currently

8
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,379
getting a Blue Man Group ad. Let me, like, shrink the screen because it's going to distract me.

9
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:42,759
There we go. That's better. Oh, you piece of crap. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing?

10
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:53,819
I don't care about Blue. I've already seen the Blue Man Group. All right. Here we go. Uh, so,

11
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,840
S is, like, the best I've ever had. D is, like, place sucks, or at least I think it sucks.

12
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,840
Welcome to two months ago. I'm the streamer that's doing it now. Here we go. Uh, Papa John's,

13
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,330
Papa John's is, I think, sucks. It's gross. But I can already, I can put that one out. White Castle

14
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:28,490
is not good at all. Um, can I be done? Can I just be done? Can all these just be,

15
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:39,750
like, who cares? Okay. Um, wait, why is there a soda on here? Disqualified.

16
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:55,930
Cashberg? Cashburger? Rashberg? Like, like, Rashburger. I don't know what this place is.

17
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:11,060
Disqualified. I don't know what Cashberg is. Sonic? Awful. Subway? Awful. All the way. No,

18
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:25,589
I can't put everything in D. Everything's gonna be it. Wait, hold on. I'm gonna, hold on,

19
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm gonna leave it like this for now. I'm gonna piss off a lot of people with this,

20
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:40,360
but I don't think, I think Chipotle's not very good. Church's Chicken? I've never eaten it.

21
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:59,899
Okay. Quiznos was god tier. Absolute god tier. But they, they, like, didn't they close permanently?

22
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:06,180
I haven't seen a Quiznos in probably, like, fucking 10 years. They're closing them all up.

23
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:20,379
Keep it a B. Deserves to be there. I haven't eaten a Little Caesars pizza in a long time,

24
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:33,029
but I remember it was, like, not that great. Domino's? No. Long John Silver's? No. No. Dairy

25
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:42,199
Queen? You know, you're up at, you're up at C. No, you're at B. McDonald's? B. No. McDonald's? D. No.

26
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:57,610
No. Jersey Mike's overrated. Jimmy John's overrated. Mo's? Get that up on B tier.

27
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:05,930
Mo's is way better than Chipotle. I will say that a thousand times.

28
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:21,029
Elta? Denny's? Denny's can be up here. Five Guys? I don't know if I'd put Five Guys on,

29
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:32,220
on, like, the Quiznos tier. I might. Maybe. Popeyes? I've never, all right, should I take

30
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,810
off restaurants that I've never eaten before? This is kind of unfair. I've drank an A&W soda

31
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:46,100
before, isn't that, is that all right? I've never had cashburg before. I'm not even sure

32
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,949
I've ever eaten at Long John Silver's, so it has to come off. Make a new tier for uneaten.

33
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:19,050
How do I do that? Uh, just make it uneaten. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Any of these restaurants new?

34
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:27,959
Uh oh. Delete this one. There we go. Oh, fuck. What happened? What happened to D? I lost D.

35
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:46,170
No, no, no, no, no. Un, add, uneaten. Got it. It's there. D. What is going on? D. How do I add

36
00:07:46,170 --> 00:08:00,120
another row? Add row below. There we go. Okay. Uneaten. That's fine. Okay. D. Let's put D where

37
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,449
it was before. What color was D before? Like, like cold? Like cold ass food? Yeah. All right.

38
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:18,490
Where have I, I gotta, I gotta, where have I not eaten? I've never had, I've never eaten Carl's

39
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:32,740
Jr. I've never, there's too many things on here. Wendy's goes up here for now. I don't, I've never,

40
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,110
I've never eaten at church. I don't know what okay is. I think this, no, that's, this is Del Taco.

41
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,309
I think I've had this once, but I don't even remember eating it. So I'm gonna, it's as if

42
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:51,879
I never had it in the first place. Chick-fil-A. I've eaten it a couple times. It was very good.

43
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:01,940
Is it better than Denny's? Yeah. HBO. Okay. Do I have an HBO prime subscription?

44
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:13,110
Oh, no, that's Firehouse Subs. Okay. I've had Firehouse Subs before. I would put it in here.

45
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:29,210
IHOP. I'm only putting IHOP down here because I think I've driven by an IHOP

46
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:41,340
more times than I've been inside of a McDonald's. That's how I determine if I'm ever, if I'm ever

47
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,840
gonna go there. You literally drive by it and you go, oh, there's an IHOP. Never gonna eat there.

48
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:56,919
Oh, we're on that, we're on the road again. Oh, oh, I'm hungry. No, I could really go for some

49
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,539
food right now. Something cheap and something that I got, a sit-down place. No, I don't think so.

50
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,740
That's, that's not that I've eaten there before, but I just, I, what is this? Is this Olive Garden?

51
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:20,679
I don't know what that is. Is it Olive Garden? I just see olive. Culver's. I don't know what that

52
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:28,419
is. Cash Burger, I've never eaten that. Krispy Kreme. The only experience I have at Krispy Kreme

53
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:37,059
is when my high school did a thing where you bought them and it was a huge deal and I remember

54
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:46,179
eating like two or three of them and thinking it was like just okay, I guess. Well, I, the last

55
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,779
time I had a Krispy Kreme donut, I was probably like 16, so I may as well have never even eaten.

56
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,289
Because I can't, I cannot reliably place it anywhere. I've only had it once like 15 years ago.

57
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:07,990
Dunkin' Donuts? Sucks, but it's, it's all right though. No, I wouldn't, what did I put, what did

58
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:21,320
I put Dunkin' Donuts up with Denny's? I definitely, no, I wouldn't do that. Krispy Kreme is S tier,

59
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,799
that's fine, but I've never played it before. I had, I've never played that game.

60
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:35,159
Shits? This place called Sheets? I don't think I want to eat at the place called Shits.

61
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:52,309
Is that what that place is actually called? It's called Shits. No, it's not. I've never had it. I

62
00:11:52,309 --> 00:12:01,940
don't know. Is it fictional? People are going to be mad about this one too. In-N-Out Burger!

63
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,419
We're all in an, oh, I can't wait to see where he puts In-N-Out. It's going to be like fucking up on

64
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:22,710
A. It's all right, settle down. It's okay. It's just a hamburger restaurant. Don't worry if it's,

65
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:44,230
it's going to be fine. Relax. They don't even fucking compare. Is it better than McDonald's?

66
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,470
No, and I have to go through these and I have to do each one in an individual subcategory,

67
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,940
right? So this could be like an A plus down to like an A minus, right? I'll take care of this.

68
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,620
No, I know. I just got to get everything in the right mind zone here. I have not eaten here.

69
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:28,940
I've eaten here, I think, once. Let me remember. It was definitely better than

70
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:40,649
like firehouse subs. I think that's accurate. This place only does chicken, right? This is like the

71
00:13:40,649 --> 00:14:10,220
chicken place. Fuck. I had second thoughts about something here. Hold on. You have to add an F

72
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:32,059
category. Do I really have to have an F? No, having an F category is just, this is where I put places

73
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:42,539
to get people to unsubscribe the channel. Burger King. Oh, damn. Okay. Hold on a minute. Burger

74
00:14:42,539 --> 00:15:03,210
King goes up here. Does it though? Panda Express sucks. Okay. That's probably the, I don't know

75
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:17,509
if there's any others that are going to be in. I've been to like four Panda Expresses and each

76
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:24,700
time it has been, it has been awful. I mean, it's been, I'm not, I'm not saying this as like to be

77
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:35,450
like the dick or mean or anything. It's been awful every time. It really has. When you're eating

78
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:45,080
food and the only thing that you can think of is, yeah, I mean, it's, I wouldn't order this again,

79
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:53,720
but it's, it's, it's edible. It's not, it's edible. Yeah. So is a fucking shoe if you chop it up.

80
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,000
Hold on though. I'm about to bring a lot of people back into, into my corner here.

81
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:30,659
I don't get it. In fact, I'm doing this. I don't, I'm not a big fan of the way the Starbucks coffee

82
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:39,259
tastes. I don't really, it's, it's coffee. It's all right. But I don't know if it's like, look,

83
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,149
here's the thing about Dunkin Donuts versus Starbucks. Dunkin Donuts, they're going to screw

84
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,389
your order up all the time. And sometimes you're going to drink out of the cup and you're going to

85
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:54,490
like get like a burning taste in your mouth and you're going to go like, but it's like three and

86
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:03,429
a half dollars less expensive than this one. And if you're going to drink this one, you may as well

87
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:14,730
just go to like the next level up of coffee. Now that's not to say that if you, I mean, there's a

88
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,809
Starbucks everywhere. I drink Starbucks fucking all the time. If there's a Starbucks in the corner,

89
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,930
it's like, all right, well, I'm just going to get a coffee. I'm not saying don't ever, I'm just saying

90
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:28,339
the differences that it's not that it's not that big of a deal. If you drink Dunkin Donuts over

91
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,220
Starbucks, one of them's quick and fast and cheap. The other one is

92
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,640
fast and I don't know what's the word I'm looking for.

93
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:58,859
Fast and expensive. They have some good stuff at Starbucks though. Somebody said the refreshers.

94
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:07,259
Those things are really good. No, but I would rather drink it like another coffee shop than

95
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,940
Starbucks. Okay. Tim Hortons, never had it. Sorry. Sorry to all the Canadians. I've never had it

96
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:21,579
before. Arby's. Now here's a tough one because Arby's, depending on the day, Arby's is either a

97
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:29,740
B or an F. I've gone to Arby's before and been like, wow, that was like really delicious.

98
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:35,500
And I've been there the other half of the time and it was like unedible. I want to throw this

99
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:48,680
in the trash. So I don't know where to put it. Probably down here. KFC, KFC can go up here.

100
00:18:49,319 --> 00:19:08,259
KFC is just like Kane's 0.4. You know what I mean? Buffalo Wild Wings? My D is going to be

101
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:19,849
full of stuff. Fatburger. Have I had Fatburger? Maybe once or twice. Maybe. Is it enough to rate

102
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:46,519
it? I had to change my opinion on that. How is Taco Bell an A? It just is. Pizza Hut. Whoa, whoa,

103
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:57,339
what? What? What? Everyone's freaking out. The stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut. That's my

104
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:03,670
level here. Is the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut better than anything on the Chipotle menu?

105
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:09,339
Yes. Is the stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut better than anything on the McDonald's menu?

106
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:18,519
Yes. Better than anything on Jersey Mike's menu? Yes. Better than anything on Jimmy John's menu?

107
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:33,819
Yes. Better than anything on that menu? Yes. Actually, no. All right, I got it. Yeah,

108
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:37,180
like the patty melt from Denny's is just better than the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut.

109
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:50,839
Fuck! Better than In-N-Out though, for sure. Do I have to level? I might have to level up Denny's.

110
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:59,640
You don't have any pizza places above a C. It's because most of the fucking pizza chain places

111
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:13,049
suck. No, Denny's is going to be a high C, I think. Let's move it over here. Look, I really

112
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:21,289
don't want to be like a pizza elitist or a dick or anything, but if you live in an area that has,

113
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,289
look, pizza places, think about if you just type into your phone or like into Google or whatever,

114
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:33,829
just type in pizza place or pizza nearby, there's more pizza places than there are Starbuckses.

115
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:40,410
And I'm not talking about like Pizza Hut. I'm talking about like, like Sal's Pizza,

116
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:48,019
like Pizzeria Regina, like there's so many pizza places that are better than Pizza Hut. There are

117
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,940
so many pizza places that exist that are not chain pizza restaurants, why would you ever eat

118
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:59,509
at one of the chains? If you live in a city, if you don't have that option, then I completely

119
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:06,890
understand. Yeah. But if there is another pizza place that's not Domino's, it's probably going

120
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:19,319
to be better than Domino's. Eat family pizza. That's right. Chain pizza survives off quantity,

121
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:28,789
not quality. Yeah. And look, Pizza Hut's out here at C. Domino's is, I just don't like Domino's. I

122
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:38,359
really don't. I like Pizza Hut. I would choose Pizza Hut over a lot of restaurants, like actual

123
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,019
pizza restaurants. I would, by that logic, everything on this list should be lower than

124
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:50,099
B with all local restaurants at an A or a B. Yeah, I gotta love my local restaurant up here,

125
00:22:50,099 --> 00:23:02,660
Taco Bell. All right, let's keep going. Panera Bread is a C. Panera Bread,

126
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,839
once you eat Panera Bread like three times, the, oh wow, a cheddar broccoli soup and a bread bowl,

127
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,440
like you don't give a shit anymore. You don't, it doesn't matter anymore. It's just like a

128
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,380
soup and a bowl. If it's your first time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably up here. If it's your

129
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:26,420
fifth time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably like over here. It's not, it loses its flair.

130
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,859
It's still all right though. I still, it's not, it's still good. I don't know what this is.

131
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:44,069
What is that? I don't know. Popeye's Chicken. Unfortunately, everybody, I have never eaten it.

132
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:56,599
I've not had it one time. Oh, hold on, I'm losing the, Zaxby's? Never had it. Boston Market,

133
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,690
I think I've had it twice. Maybe not even, and this was like 20 years ago. So the recipe

134
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:15,559
definitely changed. Fat Burger. I don't remember. I like, it's probably, no, it was all right.

135
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,259
Jack in the Box is, if you're going to go to Jack in the Box, just go to McDonald's.

136
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,819
I've had it a couple of times and it's been like cold and gross and awful. Same thing with

137
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:46,519
Sonic. Where's Sonic? Make sure Sonic's at F. If it's, my reasoning for Sonic being an F

138
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:54,279
is because I've had it a few times and every single fucking time it was cold. It took like

139
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:04,200
30 minutes to come out and was not very good. That's just the way it was. I'm, I'm, I've,

140
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,339
I've eaten the food there. I know Sonic does a bunch of those, he's like weird,

141
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:17,289
like frat, strawberry cheesecake, banana lime cream drinks that I've never, I've never had one.

142
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:29,369
No, I'm not a fan. It's a meme restaurant? But what about those funny commercial guys?

143
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:45,220
Oh yeah, those, there are the two funny commercial guys. All right, so Wawa. I think I've had Wawa

144
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,849
before. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, I'm not gonna look. Is

145
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:56,900
Wawa like a bowl place where you make your own bowl? Is it like, kind of Asian fusion? It is,

146
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:15,539
right? Okay, well then I don't think I've ever had it. Steak and Shake. I've had this a few times,

147
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,690
but not enough to like, to make, this is the thing, there's too many things here.

148
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,180
I remember being all right. It was, I remember being at like, okay.

149
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:38,779
Wada Burger. There's too many like burger places. I've had too many hamburgers.

150
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:46,279
I don't remember. I think I've had it once. And every one of these places that I've had one time

151
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:54,539
was just, oh, okay, it's pretty, it's good. But is that like, oh, S tier? No, I don't know, but I'd

152
00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:04,009
see. What was this one? Somebody gave a lot of money. Hold on. KXZ just gave another $50. Thank

153
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:15,539
you, KXZ. Thank you. 50 bucks disgusting medieval peasant food in local pizza places, A tier or

154
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:24,170
riot. This is fast food though. We got to at least be fair, but thank you for the fucking 50 bucks.

155
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,079
Why do I have KFC over Wada Burger? Well, I haven't done my complete list yet.

156
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,980
Hey, when am I supposed to get a drink? Little Caesars. It's probably down here. Long John

157
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,259
Silver's. I don't have never hit it. I don't know what this is. Never eaten it. I thought that was

158
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:59,720
Starbucks too. The rest of these, I don't think I've had at all. Wing Stop. I don't, I've never had

159
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:10,920
this. What's Ojan? Ojan? I've never had it. What's, I don't know what that is. I don't think I've had

160
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,890
any of these. Look, I don't eat that much fast food. I only eat the fucking S tier ones.

161
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:28,420
Checkers. No, I've never had it. Checkers. Half of these restaurants are not even physically

162
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,980
available to me my whole life. How am I supposed to go to a Tim Hortons when you have to live in

163
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Canada to drink it? I live in the United States of America. There's no Tim Hortons in America.

164
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,990
There's, there's one in New York. Oh shit. I've gotta get on that plane and go to New York to

165
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:05,799
drink Tim Hortons. This is what I've eaten. Let me, let me, let me make sure. And I'm gonna put the

166
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,859
uneaten ones in their own category. Places where I probably never will eat. The bottom is places I

167
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:15,299
will never eat. Places up top is like, you know what? I'll check it out. Might sound like pretty

168
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:31,799
good to me. Remember, it's in line. So like one, two, this is top to bottom. Cashberg sounds

169
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:39,750
interesting. I don't, I don't want churches. All right. I'm going to put this up here because

170
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:45,109
I feel like I've had it. And I remember it, my, my walked by and said, it looked like I want to go

171
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:51,339
in that place. I don't know. I'm not going to eat here. I don't know anything about it.

172
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,539
Krispy Kreme. But I, would I actually go into a Krispy Kreme donut to buy Krispy Kremes? I feel

173
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,299
like I would only want that if somebody handed it to me and said, Hey, this is a Krispy Kreme donut.

174
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:19,660
Do you want one? Sure. I guess I'll have one. I'm not eating at shits. No, I would try shits.

175
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:30,819
Yeah. Just cause it would be like, Oh yeah. I would eat shits. Carl's Jr. No, I don't,

176
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:56,390
I'm not going to eat. Sorry. I'm not going to eat at Emote Arby's. Um, I think that's all right.

177
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:05,430
I would eat at this place. I, I, you know, I want, I want Popeyes. I'll try it. That's the next place

178
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm going to eat. That's, I don't know if that is, is, is Popeyes even on the west coast? Is it like

179
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:21,700
even in Las Vegas? Is there one in Las Vegas? I will go to it. Wait, that's, that's Kudobo. That's

180
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,990
Kudobo. Oh, Kudobo is good. All right. Let's put this up here. I didn't know what that was. That's

181
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:43,430
okay. That's no, that's pretty good. I've had it before. It's good. I've had it. Yeah. All right.

182
00:31:43,430 --> 00:32:08,680
Let's see. What's the worst? That's accurate. Where's Chipotle? Where's Chipotle? Where's Chipotle?

183
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:22,309
And why is it not down here at D? Where is Chipotle? Oh, it's the first seat. Get out of there.

184
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:29,859
No, it does not belong there. All right. Let's go, but let's go worst to best here. So definitely

185
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:34,339
Pan, I just, Pan Express is always, it's so hit or miss. And usually it's a swing and a miss every

186
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:40,650
time. It just, I'm sorry. It just is. Out of all these restaurants that I think are all right,

187
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:47,859
that I would eat at, which one would I want to eat at the most or drink at the most?

188
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:10,700
Holy shit. I don't know if I can do this. Like I'm not going back to Arby's.

189
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:23,029
You know what I mean? Fool me once. Shame on me. Fool me twice. You can't get fooled again.

190
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:35,160
Whatever he said, that funny George Bush thing. Um, I don't, I really, really don't like Domino's.

191
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:45,740
I don't, I think it's bad. Buffalo Wild Wings is all right. They only do one thing that's worth

192
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:55,529
eating there though. But it is in the title, but sometimes they're not, but I drive by, I hop and

193
00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:08,699
I go, Oh no. It's not Papa John's. Papa John's is all the way at the bottom. This Papa John's just

194
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,980
tastes like a DiGiorno pizza that you made in your own house. Like you do like put the DiGiorno in the

195
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:20,059
oven and it came out and it was a Papa John's pizza. That's what it tastes like. I don't, I

196
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:31,260
don't want a like delivery DiGiorno. I want a delivery pizza. Why the fuck is there a Papa John

197
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:48,809
emote? What? It's not delivery. I know. It's not delivery. No, this is delivery. No, Papa John's,

198
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:53,690
you bite into the pizza and you take a big bite and every topping and all the cheese and everything

199
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,519
just comes off. That's why. Oh, was this a mushroom, onions and peppers pizza? Let me take a bite of

200
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:32,230
that. Oh, oops. I'll take my fucking like double dare flag that I'm left with. No, I'm sorry. I've

201
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,110
made my decision. I would drink an A&W root beer right now. In fact, you know what? Let's get this

202
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,630
up here. Just because I just saw that and I was like I want a fresh fucking frosty bug of A&W

203
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:51,349
that goes up to the level because of that. I don't know why. I just thought this said free wi-fi.

204
00:35:54,389 --> 00:36:00,309
Free wi-fi at Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings? What? That's, that's different. That's not the, that's not

205
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:17,269
the name of the restaurant. Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings. You get free fucking wi-fi. This is accurate now.

206
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:27,110
I mean White Castle has the, if I like, if I drove by one of these D restaurants. All right. Ooh,

207
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:33,460
they made a movie about this. This is, he's a cartoon. Like the other thing is based on

208
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,179
television and fucking movies and video games. This is a cartoon. Buffalo, this is my like,

209
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:43,539
this is my sign. The Ox. And they made a funny movie about this. All right, there you go.

210
00:36:44,099 --> 00:37:18,250
I got it. That looks good, right? Perfect. Little Caesars is good for the price. Don't

211
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:34,099
complain about a $5 pizza. Yeah, but, but a $5 pizza is, is not that good. I'm not, I'm just,

212
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:38,099
this is not about price. This is about like eating and like how much I want to eat there.

213
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:49,019
But it's $5. Right. But that's, it's not down here. This is, so this is almost a C,

214
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:55,820
this is almost a D+, C-. To me, this is about like what I would want to eat. Not about like,

215
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:02,070
oh, hey. I mean, sometimes it's about like spending less money. But I mean, look,

216
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,070
I got like Pizza Hut up here. I got like Wendy's at B tier. It's about, it's not about the cost.

217
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:18,570
Taco Bell is A for me. It's like a dollar for a taco here. Best thing, oh, I can tell you right

218
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:25,369
now. And you're solidifying the reason why it's up here. Cheesy gordita crunch with a Doritos,

219
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,809
nacho Doritos taco shell is the reason. If that wasn't on the menu, this is down here.

220
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:48,980
I swear to fucking God, that menu item brings this from an F to an A. That's the worst menu item.

221
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,119
You and I got some beef now. We have a problem. That's like the best, that's my favorite thing

222
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,000
to ever eat at a fast food restaurant. It's the best thing. It's the fucking best thing in the

223
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,349
world. It's, I want one right now. Cheesy gordita crunch. I will write it down. I'll use my one chat

224
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:44,980
message for 30 minutes. I'll make sure you get it. Don't do that though. Tweet it out. No,

225
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,940
I can't tweet out food stuff anymore because people think I'm like a monster. It's fucking so

226
00:39:52,940 --> 00:40:02,570
good. All right, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. If I were to do the IHOP no drive through,

227
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:06,809
I would stop, I would stop the car and I would turn in if it was a little Caesar's.

228
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:13,130
That would, it's what would happen. Where's D'Angelo's? Now that's a really good question

229
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,469
because D'Angelo's would be up here. Can I just pretend that this is D'Angelo's?

230
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:27,320
Quiznos doesn't exist anymore. Where's Papa Gino's? Papa Gino's in D'Angelo's. Papa Gino's,

231
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,440
I mean it's like a New England thing, but Papa Gino's is some of the best chain pizza I've ever

232
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:44,889
had. Papa Gino's is up here or here. Papa Gino's is the best Papa in regards to pizza places.

233
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:52,539
That's a New England place, yeah. But that's not fair. In-N-Out's a fucking west coast thing. Why

234
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:59,300
is it on here and not Papa Gino's? D'Angelo's, okay, I'm gonna pretend this is D'Angelo's.

235
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:07,590
If it's Quiznos, it can stay there, but I'm gonna pretend it's D'Angelo's. I might have to make some

236
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,349
changes though. All right, so we got, this is important because this is like places that,

237
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:21,929
remember, these, it's not about, not Jersey Mike's is so much better than it. No, no, no, no, no,

238
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:28,300
but if I'm not gonna stop at, for Jersey Mike's, I'm not gonna like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

239
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:40,420
If I see those, those golden arches, you might get me to stop because of how hungry I am. I'll

240
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:49,900
drive by and I'll get just the waft of the dumpster as I'm going through and it'll be really disgusting

241
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,139
and you'll get that like wet trash smell while you're in the drive-through and you're like, oh,

242
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:03,659
and then you keep going and you realize the reward for your dedication. Two plain McChickens with

243
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:34,519
mayo and lettuce. Big Mac meal. You can't beat it. It's unbeatable. Can I be honest with you?

244
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:42,119
Can I be honest with you, right? These three restaurants are the same restaurant.

245
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:55,019
I don't have, they're the same place. That's why they're together. When I think of like

246
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:02,460
Whataburger, if I was inside of a steak and shake and you told me it was a Whataburger,

247
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:08,980
but the sign said fat burger, I'd be like, this is the, this is the same thing. I, this,

248
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,280
this is just a cheeseburger. When you're talking about Shake Shack though, that's how you level

249
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:32,969
up. We get it. You spin Shake Shack doesn't sponsor anybody. You think Shake Shack needs

250
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:37,610
to sponsor somebody? The reason why Taco Bell probably sponsors people is because no, no,

251
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:56,219
nevermind. All right, slow down. These two, they even have the same name. Jimmy John's, Jersey

252
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:06,199
Mike's. Jersey Jim's like, they're the same fucking restaurant to me. Jim Jersey, Jim John's

253
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:14,699
Sub Sandwich Mike. Mike, Jim. It's just two, it's like name and then place. Jim, Mike, Jersey,

254
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:39,269
John. Yeah, fuck that. I feel like these are rivals. These are guys that are across the street from

255
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:47,800
each other that like prank each other. This is, this is like the, the, the Bob's Burgers made an

256
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,809
entire like storyline about this and it's real. This is just the other restaurant. This is like

257
00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:05,579
the, but no, this is way worse than that because this is the same, the same name. Sandwich Shop

258
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:11,539
sitcom. Yeah. All right. I'm getting ahead of myself here. That's not fair. Chipotle's at the

259
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:35,260
very bottom. I'm sorry. It has to go there. I don't like that place and I'm not going to eat there.

260
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,139
I'm not going to stop there. I'm not going to stop at Chipotle. Chipotle is not that, it's,

261
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:45,289
I'm not going to eat there. They're everywhere. It's next to Starbucks because there's as many

262
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,889
Chipotle's as there are Starbucks and they're usually right in the same fucking mall,

263
00:45:50,340 --> 00:46:12,380
connected at the wall together. But which would I rather go in? I can't, I can't have it up at C.

264
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:22,550
I understand what, why this would be here. I've had, you know, it's funny. I've had,

265
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,579
I've had one of these, but they're both the same restaurant to me. So I don't know which one it was.

266
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:34,420
I have no fucking idea. It was a sandwich place and it had somebody's name in it.

267
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:43,480
It was just, and the signs, they use the same red letters. It's just, I can't have it. I'm sorry.

268
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,900
Why is KFC a C? We're getting there. Hold on. I got to make sure that this is correct.

269
00:46:52,539 --> 00:47:16,260
Denny's is way too high. McDonald's and Denny's are up a little too high, I think.

270
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:52,170
He just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out. Kim loves In-N-Out. What happened?

271
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:59,179
Bro, you just, what, what, what was it? Was it loud? Let me listen to it.

272
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:04,170
Show it to me. What was it? Was it loud noise? Was it that, was it that loud? I'm sorry. I didn't

273
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:13,880
think it was that loud. Where are my headphones? Was it fucking loud? I just scared the shit out

274
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:45,690
of your cat. He just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out. It wasn't that loud. Okay, yeah, it was.

275
00:48:46,570 --> 00:49:02,630
It was, it was very loud. I just didn't have my volume turned up. Could you believe what he

276
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:16,869
fucking did? Did, I saw it. Did you? Wait, what's going on here? Oh, we're fine. But I was saying,

277
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:22,710
Kim loves In-N-Out. I think, me not so much. I think it's all right. It's definitely better

278
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:29,030
than Burger King. That's a joke. I'm kidding around. Kim said my list is wrong. My list is not done.

279
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:39,880
I'm not even close. So hold all criticisms until after it's done. Everybody's talking all this

280
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:58,519
smack about my list and they have not. What am I doing? Okay. Um, all right. Instinct. Here we go.

281
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:41,860
Yeah. What did Kim say? Where's Kim's cooking? I can't like put, that's not a fast food restaurant.

282
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:55,449
Kim making food is not a fast food restaurant. That's not like going driving up to Burger King.

283
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:07,690
Are you saying that she's her, she's too slow? No. Kim is not a restaurant. He hates it. I

284
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:18,619
haven't even tasted it. I didn't even taste it. I'm talking about like today. No, whatever.

285
00:51:20,250 --> 00:52:10,019
Cooking's very good. Okay. Let's get back here. This is done. This is done. I feel like I'm playing

286
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:24,840
chess. My stream is frozen because I'm just sitting here. Okay. C is done. Now importantly,

287
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:46,230
this is like, I might have to make a few changes here. They give me the fries in the bag and the

288
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:54,940
fries soak at the bottom of the bag and it gets all oily and shit. They just, oh, I want to fry.

289
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:13,559
Here you go. Look, I want French fries. I don't want to eat eight potatoes. I don't like those.

290
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,039
I don't like the fries. I don't, I like the shitty plastic fries. I like the ones that are

291
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:24,360
like dyed yellow, wicked thin shoestring and crispy. I don't like the, I don't like the potato

292
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,400
like you bite into it and it's like eating a baked potato. No, I'm not a big fan.

293
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,460
They look, but I don't like potato wedge type fries. I like the fake gross shitty ones and I

294
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:42,170
know that that's wrong. I know that this is a wrong opinion, but okay. That's fine. It's also up at B

295
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,800
tier, which means it's really good. So I don't know what the problem is. This is going to be hard.

296
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,739
I've had these both the same amount of times and I thought they were both very good.

297
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:03,190
They got a sauce. The sauce is better. They got, they have a sauce here. That's better.

298
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:24,940
Nothing beats Moe's in this list. I just don't remember eating these. I've never had them.

299
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,579
Like I've had them once and I thought they were good, but they were the same burger.

300
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:34,460
I'm trying to teleport my brain and my memory back to when I ate Whataburger and it was just

301
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,460
the same thing I did when I ate the other, when I ate it steak and shake. It was just

302
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:45,260
I was sitting in the same chair with the same burger and the same flavor. I don't have any

303
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:53,989
other memories. I don't have memories for this. They're all the same. I'm looking through like

304
00:54:53,989 --> 00:55:03,000
the VR goggles of like the burger just going like in, you know, that was his mouth. I don't

305
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:28,380
have any other memories. I don't think Five Guys is better though. It's juicier. One of these was

306
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:40,739
juicier. I don't remember which one. One of them, one of these was juicier than Five Guys. Cheese

307
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:45,860
was melted perfectly at one of these places and I don't remember which one it was.

308
00:55:46,500 --> 00:56:10,599
Somebody just came in and said in and out C tier. What the fuck? You know, it's only up there.

309
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:18,980
It's up a full letter grade because of like it's on stream. You know what I mean? Like

310
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,510
that's like the, that's like the streamer tax here is no, I don't know. It's pretty good, man.

311
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:34,179
It's a pretty cool, pretty awesome place. See in my mind it's over here, but I can't say that. I

312
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:46,980
have to say that it's like, okay, I have to say it's good enough. The streamer tax. It's like the

313
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:57,429
I'm on camera tax. I'm fucking kidding. In and out is here's the thing I don't like about in and out

314
00:56:57,429 --> 00:57:04,059
and we're going to talk. We're going to dial the shit talk up to 11. Anytime you go to in and out

315
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:11,210
and the burgers are fine. Okay. What do I want to order it in and out? Oh, no, you're doing it wrong.

316
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:17,320
Don't order anything off this menu. What, what are you talking about? Why? Well, because there's

317
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,039
like 30 fucking secret things to order and they're all way better than the stuff on the menu. Why

318
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:27,420
don't you just fucking put it on the menu? Oh, uh, animal fries. See what they do is they open up a

319
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,739
thing of thousand Island dressing and they dump it on your fries and they add like bacon bits to

320
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:51,929
it right out of the cabinet. Fucking cool. All right. That's a straw man. These boys are like

321
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:56,250
tomato slices. What do they do? They take like tomato slices in like thousand Island dressing

322
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:15,909
and then you like pick up the fries and it's like, did you just time? I didn't time out Kim.

323
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:32,090
Wait, why did Kim get banned? Wait, what happened? Why did that happen? I'm just

324
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:39,400
talking. I'm just taking the piss in and out is fine, but why does it have to be this like

325
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:45,780
trendy secret menu thing? Just put it on the menu. They have like three or four different burgers

326
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:53,059
that you can order and none. It's just, it's not a secret. Look, it's not a secret when everybody

327
00:58:53,059 --> 00:59:01,989
knows it. Oh, don't tell anybody about those animal fries that every single fucking customer

328
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:12,539
orders. Every single customer orders these. Now tell anybody about that secret. It's a secret menu.

329
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:31,980
Don't tell anybody about those animal style fries. Word might get out. All right. We spent

330
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:39,210
a lot of time on in and out, but I got a double double animal style is good, but not worth the

331
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:56,500
15 minute wait. Oh God mute mute the microphone quick. She brought a dog. You want to say hi to

332
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:08,519
Otto? Hello, Otto. You can't time me out in real life. I didn't even time you out. Okay,

333
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:15,510
but I don't want to be raised my voice in front of Otto. So what would you change on this? This

334
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:22,039
entire list is wrong. How, why is this wrong? Look, I don't know. First of all, what would you replace?

335
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:31,780
Okay, you get one thing to replace. Which one is it? See, I told you, I don't want to raise my voice

336
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:41,800
in front of Otto. Show dog. No, we only get to see Otto for 10 seconds. All right, so what would you

337
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:48,380
change? For a second, I thought you just had a Jersey Mike's t-shirt on and I was like, what the

338
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:59,289
fuck are you thinking? Jersey Mike's. Okay, first of all, why is White Castle there? Put it like

339
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:09,210
F. White Castle is like a joke restaurant though. White Castle is like a, I thought it said Jersey

340
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:15,980
Mike's. All right, White Castle has a movie behind it though. It does? Wait, it does?

341
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:22,539
Harold and the two guys go to White Castle. Oh, I've never watched Harold and Kumar.

342
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:25,420
Nothing. That's the only reason why it's up here. Otherwise it would be an app.

343
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:37,699
I'm not going to read that. All right, so we got, look, way would you put In-N-Out on this list?

344
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:46,039
In-N-Out is fucking better than Panera Bread. Is it though? I mean, it's better than

345
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,780
banana bread and also Panera Bread. Did you say it's better than banana bread?

346
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:57,619
All right, yeah. Okay, I'll agree. In-N-Out is better than banana bread, but that's not up here.

347
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:04,260
That's not an option. It's better than Panera. Have you ever even had Firehouse Sub? Have you

348
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:11,369
ever had a bread bowl soup from Panera? It's better than, you're telling me that an In-N-Out

349
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:16,570
burger is better than a bread bowl cheddar broccoli soup from In-N-Out, I mean from Panera. Okay,

350
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:21,420
but like it's all bagged soup. What do you think they get this from?

351
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,460
They think the cow comes in and they're like, oh yeah, bring it in.

352
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:33,559
No, they all come out of a fucking bag. Otto, what's your favorite restaurant?

353
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:43,019
Oh, that was so cute that he just said that on camera. I mean, also like why is Taco Bell

354
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:48,619
like on, wait, okay, so there's an S tier which is Shake Shack and I know that that's true for you.

355
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:55,659
Same. But like why is, why is Taco Bell an A-list fast food restaurant?

356
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,340
Why wouldn't it be? It's got the cheesy gordita crunch with the nachos,

357
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,820
Doritos, Locos, Taco Bell. Have I ever had a cheesy gordita crunch? Have I ever had that?

358
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,579
I've never had, she's never had the cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell and she's wanting to talk

359
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:17,239
about why it's an A tier. Just saying is, you know, you gotta have, you gotta have a little bit of,

360
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:23,480
you gotta have some stuff to eat first before you, I mean, and that's why I have the uneaten side.

361
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,239
I mean, I've only ever had from Taco Bell, I mean, we had it a couple of nights ago,

362
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:29,559
but I ordered the same thing every single time we were going there.

363
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:34,119
Because Taco Bell is A tier and you find the thing you like at Taco Bell

364
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,190
and you eat it every time. That's giving it a high order. I don't know. That's not, this is not correct.

365
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:47,369
Is this worth the couch tonight? We're talking about fast food restaurants is not like

366
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:53,369
oh yeah, I'm on the couch tonight guys. I can't believe I liked the cheesy

367
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:57,670
gordita crunch better than In-N-Out. Where is my cooking on this list?

368
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:04,139
Your cooking is all the way up here, up at S, S plus. Okay, but is it better than Shake Shack?

369
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:11,739
If I could put another category up here that said S plus, I would and it'd be Kim's fucking perfect

370
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:18,389
cooking. But no, but that would be an insult to your cooking because this is a fast food list

371
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:21,909
and that would mean that your food would be like in the same realm as a fast food restaurant

372
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:32,019
and it's not. Is it home cooked? Wait, you don't like Sonic? Wait, you don't like Sonic?

373
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:41,400
Sonic sucks. How many times have you eaten at Sonic? I'm from the East Coast.

374
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:49,079
I used to eat Sonic all the time. That's not a quantifiable number of things. Dozens of times.

375
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:56,780
Okay, so I've had Sonic twice, so it was not good. Both times I had it, it was not very good.

376
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:03,739
It was very, it was very cold. It was, I got, I got cheesy tater tots and it was, they,

377
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:08,460
it's almost like they, there was cheesy water tots, what I would have called it. That's a

378
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,980
cheesy water tots. It's like the funny like laugh out loud term that I'm going to use. Wait,

379
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,099
you've never had Popeyes before? No. Oh, so fucking good. That's what I'm saying.

380
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:24,840
Worst item on the menu is the cheesy tots. Well, they're, that's like in every commercial,

381
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,920
they're like falling down. There's like cheese going all over the place that you didn't get the

382
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:36,280
chili cheese tots. No, I don't want diarrhea. I'm not going to put, adding, guys, adding chili

383
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:44,840
to a fast food menu item is giving you like plus 60% chance for diarrhea. Do you get a spicy bum

384
01:05:44,840 --> 01:06:13,940
from chili? Now we're going to cut the mic. Wait, you've never had this before? Why? Why? Nope.

385
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:21,210
We're back. Okay. So, uh. Wait, you've never had, wait, what is this? What is this right here?

386
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:27,820
Cash. What is, I don't know what it is. Cashberg. Look, can you see? It looks like Ashburg.

387
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:35,349
I thought it. From what I can see. It's Smashburger. Oh, the restaurant that we saw. Oh,

388
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:41,349
Smashburger. It's going up here. We've never even had it before. Wait, the restaurant that we saw

389
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:48,099
in front of them. Yeah, we've seen it before. Yeah, we've seen it before. We've seen it. I've

390
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:56,860
driven by it like three times. This, was there one in Boston? No, I think there's one in LA though.

391
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:11,340
We might have seen it when we were there at first. Everything is a burger. You've never had Carl's

392
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:21,960
Jr. either? No. I've had Carl's Jr. once. No, this is, look, look, look. You gotta look. This is all,

393
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:30,039
this is all the uneaten category. So why is Subway on this list? It's F. Did you see the grade?

394
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:36,199
That's an F. That means it's the worst thing on this list. And that's Panda Palace, right?

395
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:47,000
This? What is that place? That's Panda Express. Panda Express. It doesn't matter. It's not,

396
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,400
I don't like it. What's this person? What's this little guy right here? That's Caesar.

397
01:07:51,400 --> 01:08:01,449
Oh, that's F. He conquered Rome. And what do you mean F? Caesar's pizza? Why would it be,

398
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:05,369
this is not F? Have you had it before? Yeah. I've brought an entire box home.

399
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:11,699
Wait, have you eaten this before? I didn't eat it, but I brought it home and Alan ate it.

400
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:18,090
Have I eaten this? I think you might have. What did I say? I don't know. We threw it in the garbage

401
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:39,640
the next day, so I mean. All right. So, all right. All right. So that's little Caesar's apparently.

402
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:51,500
All right. Can I, can I finish, can I finish my list? No, because it's wrong.

403
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:02,649
Caesar's is, Caesar's is worse than Panda, Panda Land. Why, why can I not think, I can't get the

404
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:13,210
name of this place in my brain? Panda Express. Right. Wow. All right. Do we have any coffee

405
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:17,850
downstairs? What time is it? It's 10 o'clock. I shouldn't be asking for coffee. Do you want some?

406
01:09:20,069 --> 01:10:37,289
All right. I'm going to get a coffee. Okay. Pot of coffee is going on. Where's mine? Oh,

407
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:52,380
fuck. Okay. There we go. What was that like frame? So I think I have confirmed that was not little

408
01:10:52,380 --> 01:11:00,569
Caesar's. That was a local place. It's going back up. I actually remember the name of the place.

409
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:16,619
That's kind of a similar name. Why is little, I, I was misled. I have not had it before. I've had it

410
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:29,210
like twice. I've won it though. I've won it. Then it's uneaten. No, but I have eaten it though.

411
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:36,310
Back in Massachusetts, I've had it like a bunch, at least twice. What's this, what was this emote?

412
01:11:48,840 --> 01:12:48,819
I'm going to finish my list. Okay. It looks good. It's done. This is my emote list. Wait,

413
01:12:48,819 --> 01:14:04,739
just got here. What the fuck is this? What's, what's wrong with this? That's it. That's done.

414
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:35,539
Perfect. I was fighting with that the whole time. So let's get this straight. Panda Panda Panda.

415
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:46,359
Is it Panda Express? Panda Express is the worst restaurant I've ever been to on this list.

416
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:04,170
Restaurant. No, it's not better. Is it better than Subway? It might be. No,

417
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:18,390
it's worse than Pizza Hut. Yeah, by about two letter grades. Is it worse than McDonald's? Yeah.

418
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:27,590
I mean, I've had better experiences from McDonald's. Fuck. Is it? Domstick with my list.

419
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:55,159
All right. That's good. Any other lists to do? What is this? What is this? File maker,

420
01:15:55,159 --> 01:16:07,510
file maker, file maker. What is this? Wait, why is there a, that's, I think, okay. I thought that

421
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:21,560
said FileMaker.com. Okay. This is my emotes. I have to write my emotes. Don't make me do this.

422
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:36,100
Actually, this is going to be pretty easy. Okay. Copy that link. Let's go here and it should just

423
01:16:36,100 --> 01:17:20,149
go, right? Let's go. Okay. I'm just preliminarily getting them out here. A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D.

424
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:36,920
We need a F tier. No, there's no, there are, there are no F tier emotes. I'm going to say,

425
01:17:36,920 --> 01:18:00,789
I would put, how did you make this? I'm actively right now going through the process that I said

426
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:06,680
I wanted to go through a long time ago. And that was, I want to go for what emotes I think are the

427
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:12,539
better ones and which ones are the worst ones. So thank you for, let, let's do it. We're doing

428
01:18:12,539 --> 01:19:00,340
it on stream. All right. Can't, you can't touch those two. This is preliminarily. I like the

429
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:22,699
top F of the Jupiter better than the bottom half. Let me think. Let me think. Let me think. Let me

430
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:53,529
think. All right. Hold on. That's correct. I don't need to do any changing here. I would,

431
01:19:53,529 --> 01:19:59,319
I would probably say, look, just because it's used the most doesn't mean I think it is the best.

432
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:15,939
Still up there. I really do. I kind of like, I like the one guy where it is.

433
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:52,949
What do I think is the board? Which one is so close to being dropped? The TV has no purpose.

434
01:20:52,949 --> 01:21:14,300
It just doesn't. This, this is no purpose for the TV. Honestly, I've, I like mustard more than I like.

435
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:25,109
Yeah. Can I, can anybody even do that emote? Anybody here even have the capability to do

436
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:41,590
that emote? Can I even do that emote? Oh yeah. Speaking of subscription emotes,

437
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:48,199
Tingy just came in with 10 community subs. Thank you, Tingy. Ten. Count them. Ten community subs

438
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:56,649
on top of the fucking hundreds at this point, I think. Thank you, Tingy. That's a shitload

439
01:21:56,649 --> 01:22:01,689
of fucking money and I'm surprised that you want to give me that kind of support. Thank you. That

440
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:12,010
means a lot. There are people that, there are people that can do that in the chat. I'm, I'm,

441
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:21,369
I'm comfortable with this. Find out whoever did that and ban them. I think, I like this. I don't

442
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:34,659
do very much. I already know all of my children here. I mean, I have to do this. This has to be

443
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:44,840
complete. Otherwise it'll, it'll freak me the fuck out. I think that's good. That's, that's pretty

444
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:50,729
good S and A tier here. Like, I mean, these are, these one, two, three, four, five, six, this,

445
01:22:50,729 --> 01:23:03,500
that's a pretty good, that's pretty good. I would probably go like this though, like that. I think

446
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:11,340
that's perfect the way it is. I've judged, this is fun to do. I think I'm going to do this again.

447
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:22,939
Did it really take me an hour to do that McDonald's tier thing? Nobody uses Germapop. That doesn't

448
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:40,229
mean it's not the best emote on the channel. What tier, what tier would a, a stream tier?

449
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:52,729
What do you mean? He likes his own face. No, that's up there because that's the first emote I ever

450
01:23:52,729 --> 01:24:01,300
had. And I still think it's the best one. This one, just by sheer volume, that's probably the

451
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:06,810
most used emote in the whole channel. And I think it's, I think I did a pretty good job on that.

452
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:37,300
I did a close-up of my face and that's it. Now it's perfect. Now it is. No, now it is. No, it's not.

453
01:24:46,010 --> 01:25:03,770
Now it's perfect. About touching anymore. No, it's perfect the way it is. Perfect the way it is.

454
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:18,779
Don't need to do anything else. All right, guys. I think that's time to go. I'll see you tomorrow.

455
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:27,350
Me and Styr are going to do something tomorrow afternoon. I don't know what the hell it is,

456
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:34,090
but we're going to do something. Some type of multiplayer game. And if not, then look,

457
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:41,000
we're going to have to figure something out because we both agreed. Hey, let's do something. Let's do

458
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,739
a vid, a stream together. That'd be fun. So something's going to happen tomorrow between

459
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:53,750
3 and 4 p.m. Pacific time. Thanks for watching. I'll get out of the way now. There's your final

460
01:25:53,750 --> 01:26:10,890
list there. And that's a nice place to call it, I think. I think so. That was Sam and Max Season 3,

461
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:21,130
Episode 1. We will return to that probably next week because tomorrow is me and Styr doing

462
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:25,050
something. And then a few days later we'll probably do, I have a couple of ideas.

463
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:39,449
So you will see Episode 2 sooner than you think. I'm scrolling down the list of bits right now,

464
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:47,539
and there are a shitload. There are a ton of bits. There are hundreds and hundreds of them.

465
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:59,640
All trying to bring the score down. Minus two. Oh, there's so many here.

466
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:18,359
Hahaha. Holy shit. The Google search results for cheesy godita crunch have increased by 300%

467
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:32,489
in the last hour. Good. I hope you eat one. But let's go back to earlier. Thank you for

468
01:27:32,489 --> 01:27:37,579
joining me on this stream. And if you take it off, maybe we'll see you tomorrow. If not,

469
01:27:37,579 --> 01:27:52,220
we'll see you again soon, maybe. So we had $2.50 from Zake. Thank you, Zake. Thanks for buying food

470
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:57,020
for my family every day ever since our dad left. You're a good man. I just don't think that eating

471
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:07,939
only cheesy Cheetos for five months straight is very healthy. Thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it.

472
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:20,729
Thank you to Red Ramen for the $10. Ten bucks. Vod boy here. Watch out chat.

473
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:27,739
Jerma has a real knee slapper coming up. Oh, that's a Vod watcher. I see.

474
01:28:42,779 --> 01:28:59,859
Thank you, Red Ramen. Enjoy the Vod. It's a good one. It's a good one. Hey, back in thanks

475
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:12,939
for the four dollars. Uh, they say minus two. There are a lot now. Uh, 25 cent bits that have

476
01:29:13,579 --> 01:29:19,659
minus two. It is more than probably 50. 25 cent bits that say minus two.

477
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:31,210
Minus two. Minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus, minus. Somebody did a plus two.

478
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:39,750
Uh, more minuses. I wonder what this fucking chart would look like. This is one you're gonna,

479
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,149
you're gonna want to look at that one. Somebody's gonna want to chart this one.

480
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:52,260
Somebody said have fun getting rich, clever streamer. Oh, Espada. Espada Escalata gave

481
01:29:52,260 --> 01:30:01,239
two dollars and fifty cents in the middle of that and they say minus two. More of that. More,

482
01:30:01,239 --> 01:30:10,359
more, more. It then turns into halfway through up here it turns into for a 25 cent minus two

483
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:20,359
bit messages to 25 cent 750 people subscribe to the channel. My, my weightlifting sub copy pasta.

484
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:29,560
Like 50 times here. Uh, Espada Escalata thanks for the 250. Chad Germa puts down the minus two

485
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:35,159
insurrection with videos of him getting ripped but spawns a copy pasta to rival Germacraft. Now

486
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:53,640
that's a plus two material. There's more, there's more of this. This went on for a while. It was 30

487
01:30:53,640 --> 01:31:01,720
straight minutes of slow mo. Germa lied about Taco Bell. Hello, Germa lied about Taco Bell.

488
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:10,220
How are you? I put your restaurant at a tier and it was the only one that was there. Congratulations.

489
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:19,800
Uh, Germa, I just got here. What the fuck happened? I don't even remember. I remember it was,

490
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:36,649
it was also wrong. That's okay, you can think that. What was that laugh? That was a laugh to rival

491
01:31:36,649 --> 01:31:46,119
Beavis and Butthead. It was all a blur before the tier lists. It kind of was, weirdly enough.

492
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:53,430
It was. It really was. I don't even remember any of the, I don't remember any of Sam and Max.

493
01:31:53,430 --> 01:32:02,380
Did we play it? Hey, Twunkstee1 thanks for the 250. This is somebody's first Germa stream. Well,

494
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:09,210
every one of my streams is somebody's first stream. Let's just hope that they come in while

495
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:19,590
I'm just hanging out having a good time. Hey, Mad at 47 thanks for the 15 dollars. 15 bucks from Mad.

496
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:30,579
Can you still curl those 35s or are you too old? I can't do it. It's just 21. I'll remember. I like,

497
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:47,350
I just add, no, I say Twunkstee21. No, I can't do that anymore. I could probably barely do 15 to 20

498
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:56,869
pounds 10 times on each hand. It's been too long, but I did use the love working out. I felt great,

499
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:13,989
but thank you for the 15 dollars, Mad. Appreciate it. More 25 set bits that,

500
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:19,590
I just want to read one. Just checking if you can skip the 30 minute wait time.

501
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:27,029
You're gonna get so much minus two when this is done. I kind of didn't though. It only happened

502
01:33:27,029 --> 01:33:44,739
for about five seconds. We also had, oh my god, there's so many of these. You did this to yourself.

503
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:50,979
Is this a scam to make people pay money? How many people made alt accounts to say,

504
01:33:50,979 --> 01:34:01,829
fuck you right now? Jerma's dumb. We are winning. Hey Jerma, when's the next TF2 vid?

505
01:34:01,829 --> 01:34:08,100
That is the one that came through. Uh, plus W plus thanks for the five dollars.

506
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:12,739
Jerma, thank you for sharing your wonderful personality with the world. I said this before

507
01:34:12,739 --> 01:34:17,859
as my one chat message, but you didn't read it so now I have to say it. I have to pay to say it.

508
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:26,180
Well thank you for the five dollars, and thank you for listening. Thank you for being here.

509
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:40,310
Without you there is no me. In a streamer sense. If there wasn't people watching,

510
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:57,539
I don't think I would have kept doing it. So, works both ways. Thank you. We also see, let's see,

511
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:04,119
one of these 25 cents that came in is funny. It says, you can't focus on the game because chat is

512
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:26,260
too slow and engaging. Nice bit extortion. It's just a ruse. When the streamer does a 30 minute

513
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:35,350
bit for money, Jerma disgust. Viewers dropping, low engagement, sell, sell, sell.

514
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:52,220
Let me out of the jar, I'm suffocating. Release me. How do I grow up to rule Twitch chat with a

515
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:58,460
fist of iron like yours? Shave your armpits. Armpit shaving stream. Shave armpits.

516
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:10,300
These are all 25 cent donations that came in. Somebody says, fuck you. Baskin Robbins mom's

517
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:15,420
baking cookies ice cream is a mother's day only ice cream. I went into Baskin Robbins and I looked

518
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:38,680
like a fool. What? No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not, is it? No, it's there. It's there.

519
01:36:47,029 --> 01:36:53,350
Dude, I've looked for that ice cream in six stores. I can't find it. Really? No, it's there. You're

520
01:36:53,350 --> 01:37:06,470
gonna get it. It's definitely not seasonal. Hey, AzzyDreamer, thanks for the five community subs.

521
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:13,609
Welcome. Thank you. And congratulations to the five lucky contestants that got the community subs.

522
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:29,189
Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs. Somebody has a question here. Somebody,

523
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:33,989
this is one of the random just 25 cent like just, it was just flowing in here.

524
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:40,699
Really not the best place to ask this question, but I'm gonna answer it because it's a strange

525
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:45,659
place to put this. In the middle of the 25 cent spam, there's somebody that says, I'm looking for

526
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:51,420
a lost video, Jerma. Where's that Twitter video of a star wasting a bunch of money he won from

527
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:59,640
You and a Bet on McChickens? I can't find it. I don't, I have no idea what you're talking about.

528
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:07,720
I don't know what you mean. I don't know. I don't know. I don't recall that Twitter video.

529
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:19,140
I don't know what that means. I'm sorry. Hey, Demoniccucumber, thanks for the 250.

530
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:24,739
Why did you empty your Google Play wallet on Twitch bits? I'm sorry, mom. I had to tell my

531
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:42,539
favorite streamer how much he sucked with them. Thank you for the $10 from, uh, Poopookie? It's

532
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:52,630
uh, Pookey? Pookey? Pookey? I think. You pick, yup. Just like that Nickelodeon you pick. Get your

533
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:57,829
toll-free phone out and dial 1-800. You pick Nickelodeon. Press 1 for Doug. Press 2 for

534
01:38:57,829 --> 01:39:11,779
Ren and Stimpy. Press 3 for OurRealMonsters. You pick. Well, what's the... Did I say this like two

535
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:26,439
weeks ago? I mean, that's a real thing. Well, thank you to the $10 regardless, Pookey. Demoniccucumber,

536
01:39:26,439 --> 01:39:31,239
thanks for the $3. Based on how Twitch searches their chats, you're gonna get your account flagged

537
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:39,640
for botting because of this stupid bit. Nah, I'll be all right. They got fucking data. All they need

538
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:55,579
is the data and they have good to go. This is like when each text used to cost money. Us boomers are

539
01:39:55,579 --> 01:40:11,319
used to this. We're calling collect to chat. That's a good one. That's right. I can only do

540
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:31,930
this twice, so I better make this count. Did you? No, you didn't. And yes, that was the second

541
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:51,819
message. Maybe it was worth it. Swiggity swanky, thanks to the $5. This all started when you

542
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:59,899
encouraged chat by noticing the memes. Don't you realize you are an enabler of chat? If you started

543
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:05,100
going on a tirade about peepee poo poo, chat would go insane. You went off the rails with this one,

544
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:10,619
big boy. I estimate that this damage you've helped create will last only a few weeks,

545
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:20,380
so nothing permanent, like hair loss. And they fucking had a... ready? Really? Another gnome

546
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:31,189
link. Thank you. This is from C4G, thanks to the $5. Hey, Jerma, I think this is the end of the bot.

547
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:35,430
It had a good weird run and this was a perfect finale for it. Thanks for letting it stick around

548
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:46,180
for so long. Absolutely, there's a link. Okay, thank you for the $5. I really appreciate that.

549
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:54,659
Add the bot. Why? The bot doesn't have to go yet. The bot can stay here. The bot's fucking awesome.

550
01:41:55,220 --> 01:42:00,180
It's a great idea. Yeah, maybe after a little while it might, maybe it'll start to derail

551
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:05,960
streams, but I like the derailment that it does now, so it's okay. Thank you for even contributing

552
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:15,180
that at all. That was C4G. $5. Thank you. Master Chicken, thanks for the $2.50. There's a link.

553
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:20,869
Let's click it. Thank you. Jerma, I've been watching you since the first days of TF2 with Star,

554
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:24,069
and this is the first time I've had money to donate. Just want to say that you've been a

555
01:42:24,069 --> 01:42:28,949
constant positive part of my life. Also, if you don't do the Jerma, where's Waldo? I'll be mildly

556
01:42:28,949 --> 01:42:40,819
upset. I probably will just do that, don't worry. Thank you, Master Chicken. Absolutely. We will do

557
01:42:40,819 --> 01:42:48,739
that. It sounds like a lot of fun. This next one is a $5 donation from somebody. They have

558
01:42:48,739 --> 01:43:01,189
just a link. Let's click it. Nice. And it says, thank you. Thank you. No, let me just click the

559
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:12,890
next four or five links in a row. Okay. There's no more links after that, so I'm done with clicking

560
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:26,619
links. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for the $2.50. Let's see what this is. It's a link.

561
01:43:26,619 --> 01:43:39,100
Let's click it. E-word. Hold on. What's his name? Hold on. E-word, twerty, word, twerty.

562
01:43:39,739 --> 01:43:49,289
On PC, please. Thank you. Probably. Not. I don't see why not. Probably. Unless, of course,

563
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:54,649
there's a reason why I wouldn't. Tomorrow, not the next day. Probably not. Not. On legendary mode.

564
01:43:54,649 --> 01:44:01,430
Just kidding. Delete that. Demons V, thanks for the $5. Thank you. Jerma lied about Halo.

565
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:08,170
He tends to do that. Thank you, though. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for that.

566
01:44:10,539 --> 01:44:21,989
Thank you. E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Nailed it. Okay, guess who? Another $2.50 from

567
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:31,060
E-word, twerty, word, twerty. What is this? E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thanks for the $5,

568
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:37,289
Jerma. It's the same clip. Well, it's the same clip twice. I think that maybe they thought they

569
01:44:37,289 --> 01:44:40,250
screwed it up on the first one, but you got it on the first one. Thanks for the $5 total.

570
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:47,659
Dr. Clay, thanks for the $2.50. I thought this was your voice for a second.

571
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:30,149
Uh, E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you for the $2.50. And thank you, Dr. Clay.

572
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:37,979
Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks for the $3. I have never seen a Panda Express outside of a mall

573
01:45:37,979 --> 01:46:23,859
food court. I know. Uh, Panda, Panda Pal. No, it's Panda, it's, I can't, I cannot say this.

574
01:46:23,859 --> 01:46:32,659
It has to be a different second word every time. Panda Express, Panda Land, Panda Palace, Panda

575
01:46:34,039 --> 01:46:42,899
Time. Like it has to be, I cannot say Express every time, but I really do have to say a very

576
01:46:42,899 --> 01:46:55,619
special thank you to, uh, E-word, twerty, word, twerty. Thank you to KXZ for the 30 bucks.

577
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:06,619
$30 from KXZ on top of the other huge drops of money from KXZ. Your average Taco Bell meal is

578
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:21,319
just a biological war crime waiting to happen. What the fuck? Thank you. Taco Bell is good.

579
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:30,460
One item. Other items on the list? Sure. I've ordered a taco from Taco Bell before,

580
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:38,220
and it may have well have just been nachos because it was just crushed up lettuce and stale, gross

581
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:47,100
shell with meat dumped on it. It may have, you probably stepped on it, like stomped on it

582
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:54,229
before giving it to me. You order a cheesy Gordita Crunch, which I'm going to do right now.

583
01:47:54,789 --> 01:47:58,229
No, I'm not. No, I'm not eating taco. No, I have this rule

584
01:47:59,029 --> 01:48:04,869
where I can't eat fast food more than once every like couple weeks. I can't do that. No.

585
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:16,819
But thank you KXZ for the huge amount of money. Appreciate it.

586
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:22,010
Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks to the 250. Come on man, I was trying to let the

587
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:33,000
Jerma lied meme die and then you go and rate Taco Bell an A. Uh, Phylactery Lich gave 50 bucks

588
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:38,460
earlier that I missed, and I'm sorry I missed it, but they said you take this money to Popeyes

589
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:46,149
and educate yourself. I will. I will go get the biggest bucket of chicken that they sell at Popeyes

590
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:54,329
and I will eat it off stream. Thank you for the 50 dollars Phylactery.

591
01:48:56,779 --> 01:49:03,260
Really appreciate that. It's a lot of fucking money. Thank you. I have to go get the Cajun fries? Sure.

592
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:10,329
I'll try them. Hey Dork Cube thanks for the 250. Well now that you've poked the dragon with fast

593
01:49:10,329 --> 01:49:16,170
food discussion, shout out to all the Cook Out and Vojangles fans. You should do a frozen food

594
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:23,479
tier list next. I might be able to guess who's number one. I would do those. That was fun just

595
01:49:23,479 --> 01:49:34,229
to kind of sit there for an hour. I liked that. That was cool. I had a lot of fun. Kid Cuisine S tier.

596
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:39,430
Kid Cuisine is definitely F tier. You would probably get more nutrients eating dirt from the

597
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:47,239
ground. Your father's grass clippings will probably keep you going more than Kid Cuisine will.

598
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:56,970
Just stir up your father's grass clippings from the lawn and just stir it into water and drink it.

599
01:49:56,970 --> 01:50:12,460
I'm sure that would be probably better for you. That was my childhood you monster? Me too. Hungry

600
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:21,319
man. All jokes aside, I really don't think I could do a frozen food list because I haven't

601
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:30,710
eaten them in such a long time. I don't eat frozen like microwavable dinners. I would not be able to

602
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:39,210
do that list. Should I eat a bunch of them before we do that? Why am I saying like this isn't going

603
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:57,340
to happen? Hey bake me home thanks for the 250. Take a shower you smell. I might. Oh maybe. I don't

604
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:11,699
think I do. No I got I got the odor on. I'm fine. But thank you bake me home. Thank you true proxy

605
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:15,859
for the ten bucks. Thank you Jerm for always giving me the most genuine laughs of all. Have a

606
01:51:15,859 --> 01:51:22,100
thousand bits. I will very graciously take them. Thank you so much true proxy for the ten dollars

607
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:28,020
one thousand bits. I will gladly take them. Thank you. A watt fridge thanks to the five bucks. The

608
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:31,699
secret menu exists because they haven't changed their actual menu since the day they opened

609
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,020
and it's sort of a key part of their business model. Same how their prices barely change year

610
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:46,970
to year. Yeah but at what point does does the actual menu be trumped by the secret menu?

611
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:54,180
When when your menu of the secret menu is bigger than the actual menu

612
01:51:55,590 --> 01:52:15,770
don't you think you should like switch them around? Uh thank you milkshake for the three

613
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:21,130
dollars. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier. In and out is S tier.

614
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:36,010
In and out is S tier. I you guys thought I was making that up when I was like screeching and like

615
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:45,909
like wringing. I told you you're not allowed to say in and out is bad. That's why it has the

616
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:50,789
streamer text that I'm on camera streamer text of it being in the like high somewhere in seas.

617
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:08,819
In and out is all right. It is. I would eat in and out if somebody said let's go to in and out.

618
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:19,529
I'd be like yeah fucking that sounds pretty good. Man I would also skydive if I had I could build

619
01:53:19,529 --> 01:53:30,310
up enough like the courage to do that too right? Kidding it's all right it's just a hamburger.

620
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:58,619
Jeremiah Shake Shack is overrated. You've never had it before. You've never had it before. And by

621
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:03,100
the way Shake Shack has a better chicken sandwich than most restaurants that specialize in chicken

622
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:09,020
sandwiches. They got a twofer. Better chicken sandwiches than most of the chicken sandwich

623
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:23,800
restaurants. Better burgers than the burger restaurants. Come on try it if you have it's

624
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:37,369
available. All right you know you got me there. You got me there. Shake Shack the the fries at

625
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:49,770
Shake Shack are dog shit. Yeah still S tier though because they spend so much time with

626
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:55,449
so much effort crafting such incredible quality sandwiches that something has to get left behind.

627
01:54:55,449 --> 01:55:02,779
And do you really care if the fries aren't that great? All right the fries from Five Guys and the

628
01:55:02,779 --> 01:55:13,029
fries from Shake Shack. It's the afterthought. You just don't order the fries then. Just get two

629
01:55:13,029 --> 01:55:19,930
sandwiches. Fries aren't good for you anyways. It's just starch and oil. You don't you shouldn't

630
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:32,939
even order them anyways. Get two get a chicken sandwich and get a hamburger. What are the best

631
01:55:32,939 --> 01:55:40,739
fries? That's actually pretty easy. The best french fries you can possibly get from a fast food

632
01:55:40,739 --> 01:55:59,590
restaurant McDonald's right when they come out. If they're fresh McDonald's fresh fries are better.

633
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:07,000
Burger King is pretty close if they're fresh. Burger King fries are really close if they're

634
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:14,100
fresh. I would say Burger King's are the best but here's the issue Burger King's fries are never

635
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:21,859
fresh. That's like a one in 100 chance and unless you're feeling pretty lucky I wouldn't do it.

636
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:35,750
You get the fresh Burger King fries though. Hard to beat. Wendy's fries. Wendy's fries are good.

637
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:40,649
I think I would put them they're pretty standard. Should we go back to the list and do fries only?

638
01:56:41,449 --> 01:56:52,600
Do a fry test. I would do that. That sounds like a good idea. I'm gonna do a fry taste test. I'm

639
01:56:52,600 --> 01:57:07,989
gonna get fries from Shake Shack, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, In-N-Out. Popeyes has fries.

640
01:57:08,869 --> 01:57:24,630
Interesting. They won't be fresh? Yeah they will. Thank you. Jerma lied about Taco Bell for the 250th.

641
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:27,510
Do you ever accidentally call your streamer friends by their twitch channels? That's all

642
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:37,619
they called. I don't call them anything else. I know Star as Star. That's what I say to them

643
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:46,760
in actual in real life. Talix is a Talix. Talix. The only reason why I call Kim Kim is because Kim

644
01:57:46,760 --> 01:58:11,579
is her username. You know what I'm saying? Try the other um Incredible Orb. Hey that's Orb. Hey

645
01:58:11,579 --> 01:58:21,289
Orb! Hey Orb! Orb! Orb! I don't call him by his first name. Boo yeah. Boo is just boo.

646
01:58:22,619 --> 01:58:44,300
Boo. That is how it happens usually. Demons V thanks to the five dollars. Appreciate the five

647
01:58:44,300 --> 01:59:03,140
dollars. You called Nova James before. Isn't that what people call them? It's usually by like what

648
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:10,899
like people call you in your community is what I usually go by. It's actually easier to remember

649
01:59:10,899 --> 01:59:21,420
people's handles than it is to remember their names. Interestingly enough because they could

650
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:34,979
be like a hundred Johns but you know there's only one. Excommunicado three right? That's the

651
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:46,659
that's the only person with that name. You could be like one of 20 Dan's or Dave's that I know

652
01:59:47,539 --> 02:00:07,909
or you could be the Strangler 49444. That's just who you are. Hey uh RTM thanks for the five dollars.

653
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:11,189
Just want to say thank you for bringing some laughter and joy to me in an otherwise shitty

654
02:00:11,189 --> 02:00:16,949
day. We had to put my father's dog down today and I've not been taking it well. Watching the stream

655
02:00:16,949 --> 02:00:27,770
and reading chat has helped me so thank you. I'm terribly sorry to hear that. Losing an animal is

656
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:36,300
tough. It sucks. I really hope that that dog was able to live a nice good long life

657
02:00:37,819 --> 02:00:45,369
and if it was for other circumstances then hopefully the time that the dog did have was

658
02:00:45,369 --> 02:00:50,489
full of love. So I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you for the five dollars and by all means

659
02:00:51,210 --> 02:01:00,569
absolutely we are very very happy to take your mind off it. Sorry to hear that.

660
02:01:05,529 --> 02:01:18,199
Thank you for the five dollars. We also had a ten dollars come in from Azzy Dreamer on top of the

661
02:01:18,199 --> 02:01:22,949
I believe community subs that came in as well from Azzy. Thanks for all you do Jerma. I've watched

662
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:26,789
you since TF2 days and watching on YouTube helped me through so much of my darkest times in my life

663
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:41,130
have a good one. You as well. You have a good one too. Thanks for watching for that long. Yesterday

664
02:01:42,149 --> 02:01:49,510
uh reminiscing and watching some old videos and watching maybe mention TF2 I really do like miss

665
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:59,000
that stuff. You you almost like you plant yourself back five six seven eight years ago. It's like oh

666
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:09,220
this was fucking a ton of fun but then I think about now and this shit's a ton of fucking fun too

667
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:16,890
five ten years from now I'll be looking back to this stuff going oh that was a great time.

668
02:02:17,449 --> 02:02:21,369
That was a lot of fun. Remember when we did that? Well that was great. That was so cool.

669
02:02:23,579 --> 02:02:27,020
So it works always sort of in perpetuity when you look backwards.

670
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:39,800
So thank you for the ten bucks. Thanks for sticking around for that long and I hope to

671
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:44,439
see you around more. Hopefully you stick around even longer because there's so much more going on

672
02:02:44,439 --> 02:02:54,630
to do. Thank you though. Let's get the community subs. There were a lot of them today

673
02:02:55,739 --> 02:03:05,189
on top of the all of the bit donations that came through and of course the regular resubs and the

674
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:10,729
new subs people that just didn't get a community sub. Community subs come through so often now

675
02:03:11,850 --> 02:03:18,789
that it's almost like they're taking a huge huge portion of actual subbed people to the channel.

676
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:27,239
So that's thank you for that. Whoever whoever you are whenever you do it that's some of you

677
02:03:27,239 --> 02:03:36,149
guys are responsible for tens, dozens, hundreds of people on the channel. So really appreciate it.

678
02:03:38,020 --> 02:04:01,000
Why don't we show all those names now? Here are tonight's subs. Thank you. Somebody says it's

679
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,239
gonna be weird when I've been watching Jerma since I was 12 and be like 30 in 10 years.

680
02:04:06,199 --> 02:04:18,180
Now you know that that works both ways right? That means I'll be 44. Don't really want to think

681
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:31,720
about that. I don't even want to think about 35 because I've mentioned this before but I'm at

682
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:39,460
that stage right now where I don't get to pick the 18 to 34 drop down box anymore. One more year

683
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:46,260
and I've got to do the thing I have never done and that's pick the one 35 to 55.

684
02:04:56,420 --> 02:05:00,340
There are a couple more bits to do. We have Internet Jorge

685
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:09,050
for the $15 from Internet Jorge. Take my offering so that us peasants may never suffer your wrath

686
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:27,579
again. Wrath. If I was a seven deadly sin what would I be? Pride. I don't think so. Sloth?

687
02:05:28,539 --> 02:05:46,170
No, I'm sorry. Pride. Lust. Greed. Envy. Pride. Lust. Wrath. Greed. Envy. Gluttony.

688
02:05:47,130 --> 02:06:01,260
Pride. Lust. Pride. Pride. Lust. Rage. Greed. No, Pride. Lust. Wrath. Greed. Gluttony. Envy.

689
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:16,180
What's the other one? Pride. Lust. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy.

690
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:36,149
Who am I missing? I have to write them down. Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Gluttony. Greed.

691
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:43,979
Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Wrath. Pride. Lust. Envy. Is that seven?

692
02:06:47,340 --> 02:07:05,939
Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Envy. What's the- Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed.

693
02:07:05,939 --> 02:07:27,300
Gluttony. Lust. Envy. That's six. No, it's not. Is that seven? Okay. Which one would I be?

694
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:36,229
The eighth sin. But what I was trying to say, somebody said short. Oh yeah. Wrath. Pride. Sloth.

695
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:53,750
Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Envy. Short. Funny. I think I would be a combination of- I don't think I have

696
02:07:53,750 --> 02:08:00,979
any of these things. How come there's no seven awesome sins? You know? Like, how come- why is

697
02:08:00,979 --> 02:08:05,060
it- why is there not like a holy equivalent to this? What is it? The Ten Commandments, right?

698
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:12,020
Instead of the seven deadly sins, where are like the seven things- cool things to do?

699
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:20,390
Oops, I tried to hit enter to like do another one. The seven virtues. Okay, wait. Seven virtues. What

700
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:29,899
are they? Let's see if- okay. Chastity. Temperance. Charity. Diligence. Patience. Kindness.

701
02:08:29,899 --> 02:08:57,140
And humility. Where's like Jack? Temperance. Charity. Diligence. Patience. Do a tier list

702
02:08:57,140 --> 02:09:12,100
of the sins and the virtues. No, not tonight. Maybe we'll do it again. Maybe we'll do it again

703
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:28,420
another night. Books of the Bible tier list. What are you- you trying to get me like a reservation

704
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:40,380
downstairs? Easy. Oh, we had one final bit coming from Mitchell, thanks to five dollars.

705
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:46,060
Hey, Yerma, thanks for the awesome stream tonight. Five guys being below Taco Bell is a crime against

706
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:51,100
humanity, but uh, whatever. I waited 20 minutes into the 30 minute slow-mo to ask you to play

707
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:56,779
Freedom Force 1 and 2, but the message still managed to immediately disappear. I think you'd

708
02:09:56,779 --> 02:10:03,180
love them. I think I have Freedom Force. Didn't I play Freedom Force? Well, that was Freedom Fighters.

709
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:17,159
Freedom Force. What's the final tally? I don't know. I- I- the bot got uh, eaten alive.

710
02:10:21,939 --> 02:10:30,859
Truly a minus one thousand stream. What did I do today? We did episode one of

711
02:10:30,859 --> 02:10:37,979
season three of Sam and Max, and then I spent way too long deliberating over a fast food tier list.

712
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:49,590
But uh, thank you everybody for watching. See you tomorrow. The plan is Star and I are going to do

713
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:53,430
something. I don't know. We'll see. Plans change, but that's what's supposed to happen.

714
02:10:54,630 --> 02:11:00,060
See you tomorrow at the normal time somewhere around three to four p.m. Pacific. See you tomorrow.

715
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:30,970
Have a great one.
