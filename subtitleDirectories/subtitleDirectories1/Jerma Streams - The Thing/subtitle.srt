1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:08,339
I'm actually seeing a few people do say Kurt Russell. Fortunately Kurt Russell is not in

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:20,649
this game, but hello. This is a sequel to The Thing. And wait, I didn't even tell you what

3
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:25,989
we're doing. I didn't even make a tweet. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be here.

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:01:46,299
But let the intro play for like 30 seconds. Okay. Hi everybody. Today we're going to play The Thing.

5
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,180
In quotes, The Thing, the actual game, The Thing. This is a sequel to the movie. If you've ever

6
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:12,389
seen the movie, it's a good one. It's a movie about deceit, movie about who is it, who did it.

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,860
Without spoilers for a movie in the 80s. Oh right, they've remade this game, this movie.

8
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:28,460
I forgot about that. They did do a full remake of The Thing a few years ago, didn't they?

9
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:39,189
It was a prequel, unfortunately. Really? Was it not good? What does it have on Rotten Tomatoes?

10
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:53,909
Thing? What? 2016? What? 2009? 2011? Oh, not very good at all. This is 35% on Rotten Tomatoes.

11
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:02,439
Six on IMDB and... so this is not that good. Okay. Well, whatever. Forget about this one.

12
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:13,340
If you get a six on IMDB, I don't know. Usually a seven to 7.5 is every movie.

13
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:23,659
If you're not every movie, then you know, it's horrible. IGN gave it a 10 out of 10. They did

14
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:32,009
not. What kind of boomer uses IMDB? I mean, it's just, it was listed on the... IMDB was listed there.

15
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:40,409
It had some scary scenes. But we're gonna play the game. Oh, okay. This is weird because... so

16
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,889
this game is the sequel to the movie. And I believe it is canon. This is a canon game.

17
00:03:50,840 --> 00:04:02,060
So, right? That's not incorrect. This game's also trash. Well, that's for you to say and for me to

18
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,860
find out. Because what if I love this game? I might like it. I might really like this game.

19
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:18,660
It's a third person shooter, scary, fun game. But yeah, that's what we're doing today.

20
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:28,100
It's trash. It's a trash. You don't even know that. You didn't even know what the thing was

21
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,529
until we just talked about it for 10 minutes. You haven't even seen the movie. Raise your hand if

22
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:48,889
you've seen the movie. I bet you half if you haven't even seen it. Here it is. Are we gonna

23
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:59,990
get a recap? We might get a recap, so this would be good. You guys ready? I am. Quiet during the

24
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:15,699
cutscene. Oh, okay. Normal, auto-aiming, hard, normal, or easy? No, this is a game from like

25
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:23,319
1998. I'm not doing hard. I'm doing normal. Always normal. Always normal.

26
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,819
Jeremy, the game is insanely hard. Okay, then I'm doing normal. No, I wanna be...

27
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:43,610
It's not the same. It's not what you guys think. This isn't like it is now, where there's like six

28
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:51,129
difficulties and the first four of them are easy. No, this is back in the day when hard meant

29
00:05:51,129 --> 00:06:11,480
actually hard. You motherfuckers. Are these subtitles? Was this subtitles? Could I put subtitles on?

30
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:48,839
What is going on? That's not me laughing. I know it sounds like it, but it's not.

31
00:06:52,519 --> 00:07:04,810
I gotta turn subtitles on and the game's on fucking hard. What the hell? This is not gonna be fun.

32
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,379
What do you see? David Hayter?

33
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,740
Have you found it? Your transmitter's down and everything else is foobar.

34
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,060
What do you mean? The base is gone, Colonel. It looks like massive explosives damage.

35
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,139
Any clues here are gonna be like finding a needle in a haystack. Are we sure?

36
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,139
Understood. Do a recon, see if you can find anything that'll give us an idea what happened.

37
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,720
I could try to get the chopper back to you within an hour, but visibility's not very good.

38
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:48,519
Okay, we'll make a sweep and report back. Roger. Check it out. Check up on Alpha Team or Blake.

39
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,839
Are we jumping out of the helicopter in the air? Okay, no. I was like we don't-

40
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,189
Keep your team together and get them to shelter as quickly as you can.

41
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,470
Roger that. Blake out. Okay. The snow is pretty-

42
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,370
All right, as you play through the first four levels, text pop-ups like this one will come

43
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,089
on screen from time to time to explain different parts of the game to you you can skip them by

44
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:18,490
pressing the escape button or turn them off entirely by pressing the escape button to bring

45
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:27,930
up the pause menu okay so i don't want to skip it and then selecting options you can then switch

46
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,210
the tutorials off by entering the game settings menu however they will teach you how to play the

47
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,409
game so it's suggested that you read each tutorial at least once more help and advice can be found in

48
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,090
the field manual you can find the field manual in the pause menu by pressing the escape button

49
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,419

51
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,549

52
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:09,830

53
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,269
suffer from the cold an exposure meter it's a blue meter at the bottom of the screen will show

54
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,830
you how much time you have until temperatures begin to actually harm you and take away from

55
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:26,710
your health so i have a meter at the bottom that when the meter is depleted that's when i take like

56
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:35,100
dock damage okay as you play the game you will be given objectives these appear in the top left

57
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,779

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,620
alive they blink they fidget when they are bored and they think for themselves be careful how

80
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,179
you treat them as they are all trained veterans even if they are unarmed they won't hesitate to

81
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:43,299
take you down if they decide you are acting suspiciously they will also communicate with

82
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:50,490
you both verbally and with the use of icons that appear over their heads for an explanation of the

83
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,519
overhead icons refer to your field manual okay you guys didn't think that this was going to be a

84
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,429
fucked up game well let's wrap in as has already been explained your squad mates are intelligent

85
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,830
people and they will react to your actions based on how much they trust you when you enter the

86
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,389
squad menu you will see a bar above the names of each squad member that shows their current level

87
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:20,330
of trust for any squad member if his level of trust is in the green section it means he trusts

88
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,210
you and will take orders and help you throughout your mission if his level of trust is in the

89
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,409
orange section it means he doesn't trust you and he won't help you but he isn't yet convinced

90
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:35,929
you're an enemy so he won't attack you either if his level of trust is in the red section it

91
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:45,179
means he doesn't trust you at all and sees you as an enemy okay so green is good yellow is

106
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:17,289

what does that does that mean like i'm going to throw a grenade in the room what's the different

109
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:37,529
enemy levels so at enemy level three i now see the player as an enemy and then going the other way

110
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:43,269

117
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:46,889

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,720
in the center of the screen to tell you the name of the junction box you will also see a picture

120
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,399

126
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,170
whenever you've got low enough health or any of your squad members are hurt bad enough that

127
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,450
they go into the man down state so when you're kneeling on the floor be careful when a member

128
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,490
of your squad is in this state it's only a matter of time until they die unless they're healed

129
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,730
bring your medic within close proximity to the injured person and he will automatically heal

130
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,779
them the medics you meet throughout the game can heal any member of your squad with the exception

131
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,420
of themselves so you will need to keep an eye on your medic's health and heal him yourself

132
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:21,289
when he is injured so heal me how many of those do you have all right what is this gun

197
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:35,720
offensive to me i love the thing i'm glad you did it's a great movie remember when no one knows

198
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:48,859
what a cassette tape is all right gain access to the infirmary completed uh what is that uh-oh

199
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:57,140
here take some bullets maybe that'll make you like me again the virus has the ability to replicate

200
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:03,269
the original biological entity including the clothing could be anybody it's so dark in here

201
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:07,829
do i don't have any light please don't tell me that i'm a fucking idiot and i'm gonna play

202
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:32,390
this whole game without a flashlight and it's like t power supply advanced junction boxes

203
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,529
in front of you is an advanced junction box and can only be fixed by your engineer

204
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:44,809
i've paraphrased to get your engineer to fix an advanced junction box you need to first identify

205
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:50,009
the junction box by walking up to it until its name appears as you would for a basic junction box

206
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,250
there are two ways that you can ask your engineer to fix it first if your engineer is close enough

207
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:01,769
to the junction box the i can fix it icon will appear automatically over his head this allows

208
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:07,210
you to walk right up to him and then press e which tells him to fix the junction box the second way

209
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,570
to have your engineer fix the junction box is to bring up the squad menu by pressing q select your

210
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:19,929
engineer then select the go-to option and lastly select the junction box you want him to fix he

211
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:38,679
will then go fix it can you fix this go fix it medic with the gun just looks like he's never

212
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:48,570
held one before it's freaking me out but you're holding that like a golden eye npc and that's not

213
00:34:48,570 --> 00:35:01,780
how it works okay so we're going to go through here access codes the door in front of you is

214
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,380
the access code door and you'll need an access code for it to open access codes can be found

215
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,380
written down and as part of a computer terminal message or you'll find it somehow you do not have

216
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,940
to make a note of these codes as blake can remember them why can't i remember them why is it my trouble

217
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,659
with that what why do one of my squad members have to do this when you found the access code

218
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:31,800
for a door go up to the access panel next to the door and press e look for the access code to this

219
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,920
door and return when you found it hint access codes are usually just a series of numbers and

220
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:48,010
may not be obviously labeled an infected entity has the ability to fragment and survive every part

221
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:54,170
of it as a whole why the oh the lights just turned back on right all right

222
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:02,440
oh christ what is that you didn't see that i we chill out everybody keep tight till we figure out

223
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:13,159
what's going on that is a late reaction uh-oh your squad members are always conscious of their

224
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:18,360
circumstances and the environment around them and when they've seen too much they will begin to lose

225
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,119
it to see how a squad member is handling his situation activate the squad venue if press the

226
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,400
q button and pay attention to his picture if he's doing okay he'll casually be looking from left to

227
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,920
right if he's noticeably frightened he'll be looking all around at a panicked speed if he's

228
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,400
close to outright losing it and cracking up he'll be shaking uncontrollably to reduce your squad

229
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,559
members fear try giving him a weapon or get him to follow you out of the area refer to your field

230
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,719
manual to find out about different things you can do to calm your squad members when fear gets them

231
00:36:51,719 --> 00:37:00,820
why would i give him a weapon are you good i mean i gave you a weapon but you're not doing

232
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:15,699
all right you follow me come here follow me go to how do i say follow me just come over here

233
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:29,219
follow me over here you come over here and just stay over here okay stay don't move there we go

234
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:38,940
see i did just fine i've compiled a five page report from the autopsy performed on the

235
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,699
anomalous corpse that was discovered at the norwegian outpost it appears that what we are

236
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,860
dealing with is some kind of self-repairing entity that has the ability to morph itself

237
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:59,380
into different biological forms access to medical supplies is limited to myself and garry code one

238
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:08,179
one three eight that's the kind of information willy was talking about i gotta find that report

239
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:25,190

327
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:26,869
i thought they was part of the the wait a minute don't you come any closer the hell did you come

328
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:33,110
from anyways a chopper brought me in from the u.s research station what a lie out to here that's a

329
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:42,820

330
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:48,820
like two different cutscenes if you were a squad member is injured and no medic is available you

331
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:55,059
do have the ability to heal him on your own using medical kits they'll indicate their need for help

332
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:59,699
by showing the i need health icon over their head when and when this is visible you can

333
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:03,380
automatically use a medical kit on the injured squad member by approaching him and pressing

334
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,260
alternatively if if you can equip a medic if you equip a medical kit you can heal an mpc by

335
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:19,909
approaching him yeah yeah yeah yeah just put it on your bar and mouse two cares i get it to see how

336
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:23,829
much health the squad member has at any time activate the squad menu at the bottom of this

337
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:29,269
particular panel is a red meter the fullness of it tells you how much health he has it's also

338
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:33,829
important to know that your squad members are in manned down state when they're down and bleeding

339
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,510
move quickly to heal them when they're in this condition or they'll eventually bleed to death

340
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:50,630
i don't do i have any health packs okay i do have a health pack let's do it i want to just

341
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,929
get this right since right mouse button carter isn't sure if he trusts you and he won't cooperate

342
00:55:55,929 --> 00:56:03,510
with you until he does try giving him a weapon and some ammunition to gain his trust go to the

343
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:09,909
squad member menu by pressing q and highlight carter and press enter now highlight the command

344
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:16,420
give to squad member and move the okay give to sc i know you have now given carter a weapon look

345
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:27,539
at his trust meter to see if it is in the green if not let go of the mouse to what hold on i'm

346
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:34,090
just gonna i'm not gonna read this out loud like reading comprehension if you just get you know

347
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,929
there's a study that says if you read something out loud you're not comprehending it completely

348
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:45,059
have you heard that study it's real that's why when you go through around and you're in

405
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:57,140
area killing thing beasts as you have already experienced the very small thing beasts can

406
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,739
easily be dealt with using normal weaponry however any other form of the thing requires a two-stage

407
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:09,510
attack firstly you will need to use normal weapons to reduce its health the thing's health is shown

408
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:17,899
by the color of the auto aiming target with red representing the lowest level of health once the

409
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:24,140
thing beast is on minimal health move in with a flame thrower to finish it off only fire can

410
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:29,659
actually kill these thing beasts so make sure to look out for incendiary weapons and keep a good

411
01:09:29,739 --> 01:10:01,270

437
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:50,760
is where we actually figure out if we're capable of doing it like this save point right here no i

438
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:59,020
can't even touch it hold it pierce it's blake it's okay put your weapon down no way you're

439
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,460
infected just like well he just killed all of us i'm not your word ain't shit captain i found a

440
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:09,340
report that says the only way to prove you're not one of those things is through a blood test

441
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:13,979
now there's a medical kit near the kennel you go get it and come back here and i'll watch you do

442
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:39,619
the test oh just like in the movie he shot they shoot they're shooting him well turned out he

443
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:51,449
wasn't the thing just needed to see that's so funny they were just like nobody was even talking

444
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:57,619
either they're just like i guess i guess we're just gonna shoot them i guess so all right we

445
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:05,449
have to go to the medical tent go get the blood test these are grenades okay anything else in

446
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:16,699
here what's this a key that looks good save it one more time no soft locking right don't get

447
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:29,800
soft locked all right we need to go find the blood tests in the medical tent which i haven't gone

448
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:38,779
this way if you kill everybody you're gonna kill the thing yeah but if i kill everybody then i

449
01:17:38,779 --> 01:18:01,369
lose this is i like this it's working out pretty well so far oh easy was there a health pack that's

450
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:11,539
it this well i guess this is shelter technically all right let's go blood all right we're looking

451
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:23,029
for medical supplies something's gonna jump around a fucking corner an engineer come here

452
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:33,659
don't get it okay break the boxes what the fuck just happened he's puking boy boy what

453
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:58,069
shoot him oh no everybody all right come here i can heal you uh how many health packs do i have

454
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:11,159
so that came out of this guy's mouth how are we all doing get in here open this everybody get in

455
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:22,090
here two shotgun shells ammo give me a pistol why can then why is there no pistol here

456
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:37,079
all right ammo wise though how you doing give ammo do you got two clips so you got two out of 20

457
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:48,739
so then you have one you only have five you've got one clip left take this take them both i think

458
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:56,789
there's a little bit more over here too is there i got so much pistol ammo all right what about

459
01:19:57,189 --> 01:20:13,590
health you could use a heal let me just equip it heal them both we're good that was fucked up

460
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:30,279
back to the flashlight all right let's do it just stay here come on you can do better than that

461
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:41,300
i just like went in the building that's it area looks good all right uh this way

462
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,510
nice i just i want a pistol or something something small so i can contribute

463
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:16,569
blood tests the blood test hypo you recently picked up is specifically designed to expose

464
01:21:16,569 --> 01:21:21,770
the virus entity when it exists in a human host you can use these to make sure a squad member is

465
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:26,890
really human and also to prove to your squad that you're not infected to boost their trust

466
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:33,050
to use a blood test hypo on a squad member simply equip it then approach him and press mouse two

467
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,850
yeah you so you do that and if they're an alien then they freak out and they turn into an alien

468
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:45,930
use on them where we're about to uh be tactical about using blood tests

469
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:54,840
they're a rare item and you won't find many yeah so this is where it gets interesting

470
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:04,260
nice you guys did it good work this is how you really play the game on hard don't you think

471

534
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:25,989
without the ability to cook them flame weaponry is the only way to kill large enemies when attacking

535
01:35:25,989 --> 01:35:30,550
your target be sure to administer enough fuel to ignite them but be aware that the environment

536
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:34,789
and squad members could become part of the barbecue we learned that one the hard way

537
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:42,069
the flamethrower can also be used to lay down fire walls that can be used to pen enemy targets

538
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:58,579
what what do you mean wait there's a i have two flamethrowers oh shit there's a

1053
04:07:43,770 --> 04:08:01,129

1054
04:08:01,129 --> 04:08:23,239

1055
04:08:23,879 --> 04:08:25,239

1056
04:08:32,860 --> 04:08:41,079
all right so give me some give me like some credit just look i don't know you know how tough it is

1057
04:08:41,079 --> 04:08:50,250
to be able to determine what's fucking real and not real look this is the image this is the original

1058
04:08:50,250 --> 04:09:00,700
actual image that for those of you watching the vod this is the image somebody linked this okay

1059
04:09:02,780 --> 04:09:06,379
and they said that this is the this was real and everyone told me it was real and look at

1060
04:09:06,379 --> 04:09:13,959
how fucking crazy you look like really like that could it could be but it's not

1061
04:09:25,219 --> 04:09:37,829
it's not real it's real it's not don't fucking say that

1062
04:09:40,149 --> 04:09:58,569
this is killing me but i'm i know the first one's real

1063
04:09:58,889 --> 04:10:09,670
oh my god when i first saw that man you don't know the emotions going through my brain because

1064
04:10:09,670 --> 04:10:14,229
i remember it was on a cell phone this is not on my computer i looked at it on my cell phone

1065
04:10:14,229 --> 04:10:34,889
so it was like all blurry and fucking small okay and then the big chin thing right so of course

1066
04:10:34,889 --> 04:10:39,209
i'm going to be skeptical of what's real and not because those of you who are here for the big chin

1067
04:10:39,290 --> 04:10:50,250
we're here for the big chin i don't mean you already know i mean fucking jesus

1068
04:10:55,129 --> 04:11:02,309
i can't get over this yet the chin was real but that's the thing it's the reverse

1069
04:11:03,030 --> 04:11:09,750
the chin was real but i was convinced it was fake this one was fake and i was convinced this

1070
04:11:09,750 --> 04:11:26,760
one was real it's just it's all over the place all right back to fucking the thing i guess

1071
04:11:30,819 --> 04:11:46,469
holy shit i this how is it already a monster in here that is so fucking ridiculous that was a true

1072
04:11:46,469 --> 04:11:53,270
breakdown on stream i i seriously that was a true breakdown that was a real one it may have been

1073
04:11:53,270 --> 04:12:12,409

i'm not infected my men are dying out there i've seen firsthand just testing is capable of oh you

1166
04:35:12,659 --> 04:35:21,259
have no idea what it could do you son of a bitch what a slow motion sprint at him

1167
04:35:22,540 --> 04:35:35,909
does get shot in the head what i thought you were smarter than that jesus christ what are you doing

1168
04:35:35,909 --> 04:35:41,909
it's just a tranquilizer faraday do you have any idea what's going on out there i have a perfect

1169
04:35:41,909 --> 04:35:48,950
idea jesus you've done it haven't you you there's so much i have to show you he's infected i think

1170
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:53,110
you'll be impressed with the result i'm tracking somebody in the face up sleeping beauty and

1171
04:35:53,990 --> 04:36:08,700
help escort the good doctor he's had a long day definitely infected no doubt it's pretty

1172
04:36:08,700 --> 04:36:15,180
much certainly security status amber in sectors one to five non-gen ink personnel are required

1173
04:36:15,180 --> 04:36:30,970
to leave the installation immediately look at that nerd neck the me i think that's me what do

1174
04:36:30,970 --> 04:36:36,500
you think you're doing faraday the infection is spread across the base all of the organisms have

1175
04:36:36,500 --> 04:36:41,220
to be destroyed if it reaches the mainland there's no stopping it wait did we just let this guy do

1176
04:36:41,220 --> 04:36:47,700
whatever they let him do whatever he wants that the infection can be controlled no no that's not

1177
04:36:47,700 --> 04:36:54,680
possible the results can't be ignored doctor i will be remembered as the first successful test

1178
04:36:55,319 --> 04:37:10,060
no not if i can help it i don't need your help never turn you back to somebody

1179
04:37:11,099 --> 04:37:17,099
right before you say not before i can help it reestablished in all sectors you think you'd want

1180
04:37:17,099 --> 04:37:31,720
to have a detention focus elsewhere he still would have got shot everybody would have been able to

1181
04:37:31,720 --> 04:37:50,740
like lunge for the gun where's my friend i got nothing medibate power turn it on hey

1182
04:37:51,779 --> 04:38:00,069

1183
04:38:00,950 --> 04:38:15,080
who the fuck is that i probably should have looked in the window of the door that would have been

1184
04:38:15,159 --> 04:38:29,240
smart hey can you help me please hey hey hey hey hey hey do something help me do something

1185
04:38:30,200 --> 04:38:47,459
do something attack this person it's a there's no bullets in the gun what are you doing

1186
04:38:49,139 --> 04:39:04,299
what are you doing in here why would you be in here without what a fucking weirdo okay so

1187
04:39:04,779 --> 04:39:25,189
first things first look through the window first and i wouldn't have seen it anyways he was he's

1188
04:39:25,189 --> 04:39:31,430
just pretending to have this gun but who the why that why are you in there with a gun in the first

1189
04:39:31,430 --> 04:39:45,270
place okay so i can open this one or that one there he is this scary monster i would laugh so

1190
04:39:45,270 --> 04:39:50,630
hard if he just like swiped a key card and they walked by this guy and they like nodded at each

1191
04:39:50,630 --> 04:40:18,650
other okay well this is at the time this there's a lot of people around okay wait code

1192
04:40:23,479 --> 04:40:34,599
boston accent kind of sounded like it uh initial bio profile of test subject 873

1193
04:40:34,599 --> 04:40:39,959
suggests a high risk of cellular rejection if implanted with the b4 strain of the cloud virus

1194
04:40:39,959 --> 04:40:45,159
this is by no means conclusive but it leads me to think that subject 873 chief medical researcher

1195
04:40:45,720 --> 04:40:55,459
jen ink what do oh but it leads me to think that subject 873 may not be suitable due to illness

1196
04:40:55,459 --> 04:41:08,889
and company status so i gotta wait till he's out of the way he's turning corner now and we open the

04:41:08,889 --> 04:41:15,880
door right next to me right here let's go get whatever i need out of here let's go fix it

1206
04:44:19,049 --> 04:44:29,240

1319
05:11:51,540 --> 05:12:11,529
started to go like i'm getting increasingly worried about the mental state of commander

1320
05:12:11,770 --> 05:12:17,049
witley i believe that he was injected himself with a b4 strain of the cloud virus even after i

1321
05:12:17,049 --> 05:12:22,569
personally refused him after the tests i currently have him under observation his behavior is becoming

1322
05:12:22,569 --> 05:12:27,130
unpredictable in addition to this i'm getting varied reports about his behavior from different

1323
05:12:27,130 --> 05:12:32,009
security personnel i'm not sure whom to trust on this and may have to issue a request for

1324
05:12:32,009 --> 05:12:37,529
termination if things get out of hand the experiments on test subject 874 blake have

1325
05:12:37,529 --> 05:12:42,810
proved inconclusive what this seems to be a minute trace of a cellular anomaly

1326
05:12:43,450 --> 05:12:48,409
that could be related to the cloud virus i will need to do further tests as the subject has an

1327
05:12:48,409 --> 05:12:56,569
unusual amount of exposure to the virus in its many forms that's me are you hiding back there

1697
06:55:05,959 --> 06:55:12,779
you need to spam that keep spamming it spam the fuck out of that i want to see what that says

1698
06:55:13,419 --> 06:55:17,340
i that's all that's the only thing i want to have in the chat hit the middle part of

1699
06:55:17,340 --> 06:55:26,810
his body to kill him i recommend too fast i recommend you too fast i recommend you throw

1700
06:55:26,810 --> 06:55:37,900
grenade you need to it's going too fast i can't do it go okay you need to hit the middle part

1701
06:55:37,900 --> 06:55:50,250
of his body i recommend throwing a grenade to his right all right all right sub only sub only sub

1702
06:55:50,250 --> 06:55:55,240
only sub only something sub only sub only put do sub only sub only sub only and then i could read

1703
06:55:55,560 --> 06:56:26,680
from there after you're out of grenades you need to hit the middle part of his body to kill him

1704
06:56:27,400 --> 06:56:31,799
i recommend throwing grenades over the rightmost box and after you're out of grenades

1705
06:56:31,799 --> 06:56:36,040
attempt to use the stun to finish him off with your ammo i beat this game a couple years ago

1706
06:56:36,599 --> 06:56:47,500
okay this box but i tried that last time and i fucking ruined everything

1707
06:56:47,819 --> 06:57:03,290
so over the over here it doesn't work man over the rightmost but i can't

1708
06:57:04,009 --> 06:57:21,740
i can't throw him any higher go into first person that wasn't part of the instructions

1709
06:57:22,380 --> 06:57:35,700
that wasn't part of the instructions oh my god this is fucking ridiculous all right get over here

1710
06:57:36,340 --> 06:57:48,020
if i can get you in the room it'd be great i'm so sick of seeing this guy he didn't even come

1711
06:57:48,020 --> 06:58:18,740

1717
06:59:42,569 --> 07:00:16,970
like in the stomach stun and shoot him ah how many bullets does it take to kill this motherfucker

1718
07:00:22,970 --> 07:00:29,259
let's be very clear about something here that was seven high explosive grenades four regular

1719
07:00:29,259 --> 07:00:47,060
grenades and like five clips into his chest final shot needs to be fire wasn't part of

1720
07:00:47,060 --> 07:01:04,470
the instructions i didn't miss all the grenades turn on auto aim lower difficulty so you can see

1721

two no not angry birds the movie too the thing boss two let's take a look the thing boss fight

1745
07:08:22,520 --> 07:08:32,200
how to beat the boss two hold on to three flame grenades i don't have those uh the thing second

1746
07:08:32,200 --> 07:08:36,520
boss is impossible i used to really like this game but the boss battles are simple hold on

1747
07:08:43,659 --> 07:08:48,939
i used to really like this game but the boss battles are simply frustrating to behold the second is

1748
07:08:48,939 --> 07:08:52,700
particularly annoying as you have to go into the first person mode to hit the boss properly

1749
07:08:52,700 --> 07:08:57,020
but unfortunately you're in a cramped space and get stuck on junk and get killed also when trying

1750
07:08:57,020 --> 07:09:01,180
to run back behind the crates in front of the door there appears to be a step that blake can't

1751
07:09:01,180 --> 07:09:18,119
walk over so um help me please beat this stupid game so i can be done with it and sell it okay

1752
07:09:18,680 --> 07:09:29,700
what do you mean sell it when was this posted 2001 okay if it's the one i'm thinking of with the big

1753
07:09:29,700 --> 07:09:37,939
ceiling tall thing and there are some tentacles that come out of the wall to your right it was

1754
07:09:37,939 --> 07:09:43,900
pretty easy wrong boss it's the one after that it's the one in the compound that you wake up

1755
07:09:43,900 --> 07:09:47,740
and after being captured behind the garage door in the big hanger that you enter after going

1756
07:09:47,740 --> 07:09:52,619
through the big tunnel i just enabled cheats to get through it but you gotta edit the registry

1757
07:09:52,619 --> 07:09:59,080
and start from scratch screw that okay let's continue hmm i don't think i've gotten to that

1758
07:09:59,080 --> 07:10:03,880
one yet i'm near the tail end of getting out of that facility but i ran my guy into an area to

1759
07:10:03,880 --> 07:10:08,840
explore and the floor suddenly caught on fire killing me and royally pissing me off because

1760
07:10:08,840 --> 07:10:13,240
there were no safe points near that area and i had already been trying to get through it hundreds of

1761
07:10:13,240 --> 07:10:22,790
times so i haven't played it since okay oh yeah you're much farther back than me oh yes i remember

1762
07:10:22,790 --> 07:10:30,729
that boss i believe it's the one with the what one trick for that one is that just inside the

1763
07:10:30,729 --> 07:10:34,250
door you can make shots between the crates with the incendiary grenade launcher in the back of

1764
07:10:34,250 --> 07:10:38,889
the boss and kill him remember to let each grenade burn out before firing the next one my brother

1765
07:10:38,889 --> 07:11:01,830
killed him with four grenades somebody's give 20 community subs this doesn't help me at all he's

1766
07:11:01,830 --> 07:11:49,220
dead did you what hey we just eat your shit watch out save save again okay you can follow me now

1767
07:11:49,220 --> 07:12:02,740
what was the point of this i don't know but thankfully i read yeah i've read that guide

1768
07:12:02,740 --> 07:12:13,509
look at my hair all we had to do was read i know i he had like two hp left you could just burn him

1769
07:12:13,509 --> 07:12:20,759
and run i thought you had to like cut his arm off or i don't know all right let's go game is saved

1770
07:12:21,400 --> 07:12:33,290
please don't turn on me now i need you that's it that's in here here we go that was the end

1771
07:12:33,290 --> 07:13:01,000
of the game that's the final end of the game so what now was that that was the thing christ

1772
07:13:01,000 --> 07:13:10,860
there's a bomb the place is gonna blow we oh we should probably run it's probably 30 seconds to

1773
07:13:10,860 --> 07:13:49,500
get out of here i only get 30 seconds that does not seem like a lot of time he didn't make it

1774
07:13:50,220 --> 07:14:28,650
he didn't make you so close you were so close was that npc what the fuck was that guy doing

2277
09:17:11,319 --> 09:17:16,279
around it's a late one i know i i would push through and do like a 10 plus hour stream but

2278
09:17:16,279 --> 09:17:23,980
i i can't physically uh i'm really not supposed to be doing that i need to go use the bathroom

2279
09:17:23,980 --> 09:17:33,900
and go take more of this fucking molasses so i'll see you guys what's today today's monday

2280
09:17:34,860 --> 09:17:44,819
i'll probably see you guys again on let me see one two i'll see you guys again on

2281
09:17:44,819 --> 09:17:54,379
thursday so i'll be off um tomorrow and wednesday and then i'll be back and we'll do thursday friday

2282
09:17:54,379 --> 09:18:02,949
saturday so i'll see you guys on thursday so on thursday we're gonna probably finish the thing

2283
09:18:05,269 --> 09:18:08,389
and then after i mean i can't imagine it'll take more than another hour or so

2284
09:18:09,540 --> 09:18:14,660
so finish the thing and then we're gonna do uh parapa the rapper and parapa the rapper too

2285
09:18:15,220 --> 09:18:25,300
i got a weird kind of shift there i know but if you think about it parapa the rapper and both

2286
09:18:25,300 --> 09:18:33,019
those two games are one to two hours long each so if there's like an hour or two left of the thing

2287
09:18:33,019 --> 09:18:38,790
or like an hour left of the thing talking about it'll be like about five six hours total so that

2288
09:18:38,790 --> 09:18:48,230
works out pretty well looking forward to it so i will see you guys in a couple days uh i

2289
09:18:48,309 --> 09:18:55,430
unfortunately i cannot do the bits right now because i really do have to go i didn't think

2290
09:18:55,430 --> 09:19:00,230
i was gonna go this long but what will happen is like we do sometimes i'm gonna go over the bits

2291
09:19:00,230 --> 09:19:10,440
on holy shit there's so many uh we'll do this before and this could actually be a pretty good

2292
09:19:10,440 --> 09:19:23,699
thing to do yeah and this would be good to end it or even to begin it because this will probably

2293
09:19:23,699 --> 09:19:30,790
take about an hour or so to do and i i can't i just physically cannot i'm sorry but something

2294
09:19:30,790 --> 09:19:36,809
that we will do is at least take a look at some of the credits and i do have to say thank you
