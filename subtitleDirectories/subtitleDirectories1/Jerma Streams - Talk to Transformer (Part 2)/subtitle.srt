1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,970
All right, how long does it take to pee? Oh, not that long. I just was moving some stuff around.

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:27,960
Okay, hold on. Talking to Transformer. That's fine. Do Sam and Max? No. No, no, no, no, no,

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,390
because we're only going to do this for like an hour or two and Sam and I don't want to start

4
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,549
season three of Sam and Max and only do like, you know, get like halfway through an episode.

5
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:41,000
It's too late for Sam and Max. I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to crush your dreams here.

6
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,060
Jerma hates Sam and Max. I played the first two seasons already. Just hold on. We'll do it

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:01:02,229
eventually. Everybody needs to slow down. Well, that's not in the right place. I have to turn

8
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:14,890
this down. Hey! My hair is so fucking long. It looks so stupid. This needs to be moved to here.

9
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:29,459
Don't move. All right, let's get this also on the screen because that is the actual

10
00:01:29,459 --> 00:02:09,830
Transformer. A lot of white space, but it's okay. All right, talk to Transformer.

11
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:25,539
Let's wait. We should get a custom prompt. Okay. How about small in this? Okay. Another

12
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:42,199
six flags reviewed now. This is bright as hell in here too. I'm like getting washed out here.

13
00:02:42,199 --> 00:03:01,849
That looks better. Prompt. How about you do E3 predictions, now do an E3 review.

14
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:35,449
Okay. How about with my drink? Let me tell you a sad story. All right. How many sake has it been?

15
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:44,090
Let's see. The Japanese can really eat just about anything from rice and noodles to fruit,

16
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,849
vegetables, and more. There have long been delicious Japanese options in grocery stores and

17
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,199
home kitchens. If you can't find sake in grocery stores, you're probably getting it

18
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,930
shipped to Japan from overseas and is being sold in convenience stores or on convenience

19
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,259
food trucks. If you happen to live in Japan, if you're a veteran of the nation, then you

20
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:10,620
probably know where the best sake is. Sake lovers don't need to read the Japanese and need

21
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,340
only to look closely to see a big difference with what comes in every Japanese grocery store.

22
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,060
Japanese convenience store sake makes the largest selection of local Japanese sake available

23
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,269
in the country and is located in downtown Tokyo. On some days, a selection of sake makes

24
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:33,819
our pick at a grocery store. If you're wondering if it's a sake or just water,

25
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:42,259
we really aren't sure. Sake and water. The most common question we get from our Japanese

26
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:49,379
customers is what kind of sake their Japanese food is. Most don't have a clear definition

27
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,620
of what they are calling a sake and how you will know if your product is sake.

28
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,459
In reality, we are talking about a whole different animal our customers are. If you

29
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:06,649
don't know the difference between sake and water, you have like four taste buds.

30
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:29,019
That's not something wrong there. How about this one? Okay, how about this one?

31
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:45,189
Jerma loves sake. On his stream he drank it all night. Jerma loves sake. On his stream,

32
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:49,910
he drank it all night. And in the morning, he goes to sleep in the corner because he

33
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,290
can't handle the guilt he's feeling. His father is a well-off industrial billionaire

34
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,529
with three children, including a son in law who has a real estate business.

35
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,560
On the first day of school, the boy who plays video games on his computer becomes a boy in

36
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,319
school, even if that boy is just four years old. His friends become more and more male.

37
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,160
His mother has started to notice them and start sending him to the male tutors.

38
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,459
Some even start dressing up in dresses, which are so ridiculous but hilarious,

39
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:26,310
and then his father feels ashamed. What? The little boy who can't keep himself

40
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,629
from being in a girl's room at all times. What is going on? He starts to see a lot of young,

41
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:38,250
attractive female teachers. I have always been a girly boy. Like always, I wanted to be a girl.

42
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,680
I would try to be a girl like every day. And now I know that I'm a girl. The fact that I'm

43
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,680
always a girl is weird. Despite being in a girl's room at school, the boy loves his

44
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,199
favorite sports team. I miss playing basketball. It makes me feel weird when I miss a game

45
00:06:50,199 --> 00:07:17,980
while his favorite movie. Industrial billionaire with three. Where are the two kids? Who gives

46
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:58,170
a shit? Who gives a shit? So I gotta say about that. How about this one? Why do I have to pick

47
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:13,540
them all about me? How are they gonna find something from this? I'll make one about you

48
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,699
guys. Okay, here we go. Jerma on Reddit posts such off-topic things. I was thinking of

49
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,009
something like this. But we can all make something that could be useful in a small way.

50
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,529
You just need to decide between your own personal interest, the general interest of

51
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:32,409
the community, and how useful it is to your friends and family. You may think it is stupid

52
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,649
to try to sell something to them, but there is no point in trying to use this as your personal ATM

53
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,250
if everyone knew about the plans. If you think the person is selling it for you,

54
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,690
they're being naive because many people are already selling something to people in good

55
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,470
conditions. As a result, most people won't buy the thing if you put a price tag on it. What

56
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,169
the fuck is happening? I think I understand what you're getting at. When a product is useful

57
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,490
to someone, it will probably eventually catch on. Not just in your case. I hope it's at least

58
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,690
useful to other people. I do feel I've been... Somebody got hit in the head with a wrench.

59
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,100
Somebody just kept restarting a computer's first sentence. I hope it's at least useful to other

60
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,100
people. I do feel I've been doing this for some time, but sometimes it's the simplest thing

61
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,220
I can do right out of cake for coffee and my co-workers. So my point is that if you're

62
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,860
thinking of buying something, don't buy it until you know what you're getting with it.

63
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:32,039
The thing decides whether to buy it or not. That's always not easy on Reddit. I'm not

64
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:53,269
doing that. Somebody told me I'm not doing that. That means I'm beyond. I met at a chat at a

65
00:09:53,269 --> 00:10:10,519
grocery store the other day. You like doing this shit to me? Let's do it to you. No, no, no,

66
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:52,070
no. What did I type? Twitter is a fun website too. For that matter, you'll probably get

67
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,580
great deals on new products even with a low user count. Even the biggest name brands like

68
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:05,720
HSN, Sandsberry, and Kohl's sell $12 copies and tea through Amazon and will deliver for $10.

69
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,539
It's a good deal. People still use the home shopping network. I thought that was only

70
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:17,879
for like fucking 80-year-old women and like 95-year-old fucking men. I thought it was like

71
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:26,379
for 80-year-old old ladies. It's for like really, really old fucking people.

72
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,600
You know how I know that? Because my grandmother used to buy dolls off of the home shopping

73
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:45,639
network. Those like porcelain dolls that they would put on like the conveyor belts and like

74
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:55,639
move them around. Just like they'd spin around on like the little lazy Susan. She used to buy

75
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,450
them. There was a lot of dolls in that house. It was kind of scary. Anyways, and it's not a

76
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,220
waste at all. Here I am working seven days a week, which probably gets me at most $40 per

77
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,879
week, working 50 hours a week. In reality, what I would work for is less than $1.10 an hour.

78
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,120
So I don't lose money on each cup I pour through the funnel on e-commerce sites.

79
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,470
Where are you making $1.10 an hour? That doesn't sound like a very good thing.

80
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,590
And I spend it well into the future and into the bank. Also, I think it's important

81
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,590
to keep the quality of your work and your reputation high. You have to be very careful

82
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,700
about how you market your work. I know about these fraud checks. Those don't mean much to me,

83
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,980
but to others, they're the beginning of the end of your reputation in the community.

84
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,100
And you have your own company to prove to customers that you are legit.

85
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:01,049
I'm confident that I will go out and buy a coffee from any online coffee shop

86
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:06,730
within a few months of the first customer checking out my website. Now your next question

87
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:53,899
that I can answer. $1.10. Let's see. This shitty view count. I'm just trying to pull like metadata

88
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:03,129
for like views and like germa. Let's see. No, I didn't mean that. That wasn't like, I'm trying

89
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:10,090
to like get like the metadata to like pull info. I don't mean, I don't mean that. I'm trying

90
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:17,029
to get like metadata to like shitty and like view and count. And this is a great fucking view

91
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:23,720
count. All right, here we go. No, no, no. You're taking this the wrong way. You're taking

92
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:52,730
this the wrong way. Music? See? This is why I did this. Here we go. No, no, you guys are,

93
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,289
you guys are this is fucking shit little people here. What are you talking about?

94
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:03,610
It's fucking over 3000 people here. Six Flags is the worst amusement park.

95
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:10,009
Germa985 and his shitty view count sent me there. Anyway, it's an awesome park,

96
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:15,049
but there are many flaws in the ride. It only makes you feel like an idiot if you have

97
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:21,049
to pay for the entire show. There are a few places that can bring back the glory days of the 80s.

98
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:27,129
You can easily find a better one like the Giants Canyon. It is way too big, too short,

99
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:32,090
and to me too easy to park without trying or paying for. There are even those that would say

100
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,889
it is better to use a car and drive all around Germa985's park than visit one of the many

101
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,690
places that make this place worth checking out. If you see one of these, you can get

102
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,929
yourself in the park and even get a ride, but you won't regret it if you do not like it,

103
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,769
and you're looking for a way to save money, then Germa985 offers the cheapest ride of the parks,

104
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,769
which means you need to make a reservation. The rides are short, are cheap, and don't

105
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,730
disappoint, so you can enjoy the parks without spending tons of money. Germa985 himself

106
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,690
doesn't care too much about this, but I don't blame him for that. His ride was great in the

107
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,529
90s, and he does the same thing every year. I've never been disappointed by a ride.

108
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:23,480
They're short. That's why I wrote that. That, that, I almost just knocked over the

109
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,500
fucking bottle. No, this, the view count was fucking fantastic. Don't, don't,

110
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,179
that didn't mean that. I'm trying to just get the, like, thing to fuck up.

111
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,400
All right, one part all-purpose flour, two cups baking soda, and one, and one hint of,

112
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:27,940
a hint of what? Here we go. One part all-purpose flour, two cups baking soda,

113
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,619
and one hint of sea salt. I also add four teaspoons of garlic powder for extra flavor.

114
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:39,240
Then I roll out the loaf by laying it on parchment paper. I then lay it straight back

115
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,059
out and cut each section into four triangles. Then I start the second portion. I spread the

116
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,299
mixture onto a lightly floured surface. It takes an entire sheet of parchment to completely

117
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,500
cover it. I put that to work by cutting across the area between each piece of foil.

118
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,259
I then take them all back together and roll up the entire loaf into a sheet,

119
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:05,299
and I am back to work. When you come to these two pictures just to let things sink in,

120
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:12,630
it is like watching a roller coaster crash through a tunnel. So the dough is just amazing.

121
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,049
Not only beautiful, I can't believe how light it is on. Back to Six Flags.

122
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:54,089
Oh shit, what is playing in the background? Okay, nothing. How's that wrong? That's right,

123
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:07,049
right? Sound the alarms. The Witcher 3 just went on sale. Witcher is not a word. I guess

124
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:37,079
that's true. Nothing? Surprising. Okay, here we go. Sound the alarms. The Witcher 3

125
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,700
just went on sale today with the promise that it would be as good as the final product,

126
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,740
which is saying something when you are playing a game that is literally being created.

127
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,140
So it makes perfect sense that after all the excitement the game had for the last year,

128
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,380
the first one came out in 2004. That developer CD Projekt Red decided to take their next

129
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,299
move and deliver an HD re-release of what they are calling The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.

130
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:09,349
And with CD Projekt Red, it appears the game is going to deliver a stunning conclusion,

131
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:14,660
not just to The Witcher, but to the series itself. And I am not sure whether it should be

132
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,180
heralded as such even though the game already deserves recognition for being one of the

133
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:27,380
biggest best-liked games of all time, or just a bad game. It is the latter choice that is

134
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,339
truly important now because as the second game is coming out today as a standalone offering,

135
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,140
which is far better choice than its previous CD Projekt Red incarnation of The Witcher,

136
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,420
you can expect the CD Projekt Red version to be better. Why are there like two different

137
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,819
versions of this game? I've been meaning to write up a lot of this in my previous

138
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:50,730
article from the same episode of Game Politics Podcast with Tom Stoppard, but I

139
00:20:50,730 --> 00:21:07,480
did not have the time at some point this weekend. Game Politics. I went to Leo's?

140
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:36,809
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is Leo Pee Pants. Pee Pants's parents, Ray and

141
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:42,250
Anel, have filed a wrongful termination lawsuit claiming their daughter was fired

142
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,089
after complaining about how long she worked, and she was denied a job with his company,

143
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:53,529
the Houston Area Network Company. Pee Pants, who is a mother of two boys,

144
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,009
allegedly got in trouble after complaining that she needed to sleep longer than usual

145
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:03,769
on her shift for another project. When she went to the store, her shifts extended into

146
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:08,809
the wee hours. During one of these shifts, Pee Pants reportedly fell asleep in her seat,

147
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:14,089
but did not complain and allowed Hanop to continue the project, which was taking its

148
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:19,319
toll on her health. I do not know anyone who takes vacations for any reason except

149
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:28,309
when it's just fun. That is why if there is the slightest opportunity to relieve stress

150
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:35,450
and discomfort, I will just jump on vacation, he told DailyMail.com. Pee Pants's former

151
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,119
supervisor, James McDaniel, reportedly told her that she would receive less pay until she

152
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:50,460
paid back her rent and a $300 bonus. After Pee Pants started working for Hanop, she said

153
00:22:50,539 --> 00:23:00,519
she absolutely refused to receive salary increases after being terminated. I was not

154
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,990
allowed to speak with Hanop's CEO as she has the power to terminate. Why would you

155
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:46,410
ask for a salary increase? Oh my god. Now let's get a sad story. No, I gotta like,

156
00:23:46,410 --> 00:24:09,720
hold on. No, this is, this is, no, this doesn't make no sense. Hold on. There you go.

157
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:43,130
Ahem. Come on. Let me tell you a sad story. My Lego collection isn't complete anymore.

158
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:49,430
I was shopping at Ikea at nine to two on the way home from work one evening and I saw the

159
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:55,769
shelf on the right with a pile of boxes. As I looked underneath for any items that might

160
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:05,369
actually fit, I kept hitting myself. What do I do with these boxes? Is it better not to

161
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:13,940
have any of them? I decided to grab my collection and find me a box store. At the

162
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,660
mall I found an Ikea display case with dozens and dozens of boxes covered with brightly colored

163
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,670
stickers. My imagination raced, making small jokes and getting creative. I walked right

164
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:32,380
up to the display case and picked up three boxes marked X7 and 715. You guessed it,

165
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,140
they didn't fit in here. Finally, I decided to take a walk across the store to see exactly

166
00:25:38,140 --> 00:26:42,569
what made these. Sorry to say we're recalling all Legos. What? Wired via wired advertisement.

167
00:26:42,569 --> 00:27:02,200
Pea pants. Nice pea pants brand. Warning, all Legos pose an immediate health risk. Okay.

168
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:18,619
Is this still going? Warning, all Legos pose an immediate health risk. In 2015,

169
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:24,700
more than 13 million toys came in for inspection and maintenance. Some two billion

170
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:31,000
toy pieces fell ill with contamination in transit, which can lead to illness. About

171
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,690
one million of these were children, and a further ten children were sickened.

172
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,210
There have been a series of tests at different toy manufacturers to determine

173
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,809
if they have made all changes in the way that they package certain products to ensure that

174
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:50,279
they are compliant. But in each case they found that, on average, the items remained

175
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,930
undamaged throughout the manufacturing process. In addition, many of the changes were made

176
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,730
on the assumption that the children's toys would remain safe. It seems like that assumption

177
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,529
is incorrect, said Michael D. Lipscomb, a spokesman for the United States Consumer

178
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,970
Product Safety Commission, which is responsible for regulation for toy safety.

179
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,779
At least some of these pieces that have fallen in line are not actually toys.

180
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:41,609
The story continues. But ten children? Okay. At least some of the pieces that have fallen

181
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:46,890
in line are not actually toys, but rather sculptures. They don't really look like any

182
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:54,470
sort of real thing. A man holding up a real human skull? The whole thing is really disturbing,

183
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,750
and it shows that the concept of toy violence has definitely fallen out of favor in contemporary

184
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,789
society. It's really important to note, though, that the artwork on these sculptures

185
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:10,970
is actually, actually just plastic. Most of the pieces were created by artist Robert Court

186
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,690
over 30 years ago, though there are some in the collections of museum branches across the

187
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,849
world, like the Japanese Kiyoshi Matsumoto Museum in Kyoto. These aren't some cheap,

188
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:27,480
cheap, cheap toys. I'm not making my point, by the way. If you saw the images in the videos

189
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,599
in these slides, you probably think that the toys have gotten increasingly violent.

190
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:36,009
For the truth is that toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years or so,

191
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:53,430
but only slightly. It didn't decline. In fact, it has gotten way, way better. That's

192
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:59,029
I mean, come on. What a great story. Toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years.

193
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:16,180
The truth is toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years or so, and that toy violence has

194
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,220
fallen under control. Said Mary Jane Farkas, professor of child development at the University

195
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,180
of Wisconsin, who has developed a method for measuring the number of toys per student

196
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:32,900
for testing toy violence. In those 50 years, the research shows that toys have become a small

197
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,630
part of society. I am delighted to report that there is widespread agreement about the

198
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,069
problem of toy violence. As recently as 2000, an article in New York Times magazine by one

199
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:50,150
of Dr. Farkas' graduate students quoted a leading pediatrician, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen,

200
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,690
who stated that a great many children with auto- What? What does this have to do with toys?

201
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:11,180
And there were no safe levels. What? The government is caught at the wrong end of

202
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:30,119
the conflict turns to violence. What does this have to do with the toys? Oh my god.

203
00:31:30,680 --> 00:32:23,930
This is a fucking risky, scary fucking website. This is not what you think it's going to be at

204
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:33,450
all. No, no, no, no. This is like, it's just a rule book. This is no, this is not what I,

205
00:32:33,450 --> 00:33:19,509
hold on. Okay. Why are we always in constant conflict? That is the big question in politics.

206
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:27,460
The question that haunts our lives, our countries, our culture. Because when your side doesn't win,

207
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,859
when your side has to come up with something new or new ways of doing things, how do you

208
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,950
think about those opportunities? It never seems right. Do people say to you, what's wrong with

209
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:46,890
you? Or are you actually afraid every day to lose? You have a job. I had a job before and

210
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:53,660
it was good. And it was good. And now that I have a job, I'm a lot more proud of it now.

211
00:33:54,549 --> 00:34:01,289
Why are we willing to get paid in cash? Because I can have a place to stay if my mom wants that,

212
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:08,019
and I can do the shopping. Even when I used to go to the stores and pay $5.50, I was a lot

213
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:13,219
more afraid that they would take off me on a day I didn't have to. Because I'm a good

214
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,019
customer. And I have a lot of good things working for me now and I'm very happy.

215
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,559
I think there is a lot of resentment, even in people who don't usually like politics,

216
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:27,159
about the way they've become part of the American system. I don't like the way that

217
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:39,179
politicians become a vehicle for a lot of things, which with its own. And then they

218
00:34:39,179 --> 00:35:00,550
turned his mic off. Cut it. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Nobody starts a speech like this.

219
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,829
Nobody comes. Nobody goes to the podium. I come to you today with an epic speech.

220
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:16,500
No, why would somebody do this? You don't like get to the podium and say that. Hey,

221
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:39,829
everybody. Okay, here we go. Okay. I don't know about this one. Let's get another one.

222
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:45,670
This is too. This is like a little, this is a little over the. So that's, that's too much.

223
00:35:45,670 --> 00:36:21,369
Remove the period. I'm back. They've put my airwaves back on. I come to you today with

224
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:28,570
an epic speech. I'm not here to be lectured. I'm not here to be lectured on human nature.

225
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:50,739
I am here because I know that with each passing year, the number of, oh, I come to you today

226
00:36:52,949 --> 00:37:03,059
with an epic speech. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Cut his mic.

227
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:31,579
I come to you today with an epic speech. I'm back on the airwaves. They can't shut me off.

228
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:37,989
These motherfuckers think they can silence me in the Senate. I'm here and it's designed to

229
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:45,130
highlight new challenges that we face in dealing with climate change. I understand the challenges

230
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:52,340
posed by global warming. The question I have for you, my fellow senators, is this. Do you

231
00:37:52,340 --> 00:38:02,340
believe that those challenges are solvable? Like mumbling together. I don't know what you're

232
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:09,079
going to say. I don't know. Let him speak. Let him ask me. Silence. Climate change is a

233
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:16,250
question of survival. Today, many parts of the planet, including yours. I'm talking about you.

234
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:24,760
Oh, you fucking aliens. Everybody from the planet X-41 and global are facing a changing

235
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,420
climate. One of them that I know of is the Mediterranean Sea. As the world's most important

236
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,619
trading partner, the United States cannot afford to lose our global position as a major

237
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:42,940
investor. To ensure access to our global trading partners, we need to protect our waters,

238
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,619
our marine environment, and our airwaves and coastal areas. The U.S. Senate must commit to

239
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:54,940
a comprehensive approach to managing the risk caused by rising seas, including a plan to

240
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:01,659
reduce our nation's dependence on oil and gas. I urge you today to join me at this historic

241
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:06,780
moment in time when the United States cannot fail to act on global threats,

242
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:17,099
because I know it cannot succeed. In my view, it's that moment in time. This. Cut his mic.

243
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,219
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back. They think they can silence me and get me out of the

244
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:30,789
Senate. What the fuck do they know? They don't know shit. You won't silence me. I am the

245
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:38,739
Senate. I am everything. I come to you today with a story of my intestinal issues that are

246
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:46,150
very important. In May of 2013, I visited a local doctor who prescribed me some generic

247
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:56,139
antibiotics. She told me I needed to increase the dosage, and this is a rationale. Oh,

248
00:40:56,139 --> 00:41:01,260
what's he going to say? Oh, shoot. How dare he? Well, I say, shut up, everybody. Sit

249
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:08,059
down. I said sit down. If you go higher with this drug because of the symptoms of

250
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:15,639
chronic low-grade sepsis, then you're going to get the same result. I believe her. When I

251
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:22,380
started doing yoga, my skin began itching. As a student of yoga and a student of biochemistry,

252
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,460
I know better than to blindly ingest large numbers of antibiotics. The idea of doing

253
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,300
an increased dosage of antibiotics to see if the skin response would improve is ridiculous,

254
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,130
and I would rather not use such dangerous, powerful, and often deadly medicines.

255
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:43,179
Before I begin, let me share you a story. My wife left my family one year earlier than I did.

256
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:53,829
We met on the web. She was studying for a certification exam. We were married in

257
00:41:53,829 --> 00:42:00,070
September 2012, and early 2012 my wife had an atrial bleeding that I suspected.

258
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:28,139
Ugh. God, it's fine. I wonder the rest of the story. So do I.

259
00:42:33,000 --> 00:43:50,900
Why do we keep letting this guy back in? I'm not doing anymore. This is the last one.

260
00:43:50,900 --> 00:44:00,469
All right. Hold on. That's not. No. That one ain't going to. That's a gaffe. Yeah,

261
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:03,670
you got that right. That's a gaffe. I ain't going to do a gaffe on stream.

262
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:29,380
Uh, I'm going to whatever. Who cares? Uh, it's just nothing.

263
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:39,750
The Senate will now hear section T 47 article 8236. Will the Senator from Kentucky please

264
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:47,480
reiterate his position? Thank you for your attention. Senator Graham, Senator McConnell,

265
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,829
Senator McConnell, just so everybody understands. I've been advised by the

266
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:56,389
office of the deputy attorney general or deputy AG to defer to the confirmation of Mr. Rosenstein.

267
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,780
My position on appointment will remain unchanged. Senator Graham, Senator McConnell,

268
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,699
Senator McConnell, I defer appointment until you can get your head around the situation.

269
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:10,059
However, for the record, I remain totally open to the Senate going either way.

270
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,420
So I do ask that you will allow me to give the floor time to review any and all options

271
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,980
that you have at your disposal, not just the one which you have set out today. I appreciate

272
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,900
your Senator, your consideration and commitment to the rule of law. Now, thank you, Mr. President.

273
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,260
I would appreciate the chance. This is just a boring one. This is just, this is, this is,

274
00:45:27,260 --> 00:46:01,579
this one sucks. This is a gaffe. I got to get one more of these dumb speeches in. I do.

275
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:31,699
Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. Cut his mic. No, this is, no, this got fucked up.

276
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:40,119
This got fucked up. It got messed up. It was only like three sentences. It wasn't even

277
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:59,460
worth reading. That wasn't a gaffe. It's having trouble with this one. He's

278
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:06,760
limiting. All right. Give me, give me some, give me some, um, do religion. No, it's having

279
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,239
trouble with it. It can't do this one. Todd Howard speaks from the White House.

280
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:26,539
I'm not going to, Todd Howard speaks from the White House. I think this site might be,

281
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:56,760
I think it's, I think it's down. Shit. Cut the mic. No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.

282
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm just seeing if one word will do anything. I think it's, I think it's dead.

283
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:22,809
I'm going to try refreshing the page. Maybe it's dead. I think it's dead.

284
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:33,639
Once upon a time in German 985's backyard. Well, if it comes back, I'll do it.

285
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:44,780
They finally cut your mic. I guess they did. It'll come back. Just give it a moment.

286
00:48:44,780 --> 00:49:04,789
It'll return. Socket. I just, I just have one. What are you talking about?

287
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:11,619
I'm pacing myself with this. All right. AMA, ask me anything. Let's go.

288
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:24,780
Ask anything. Is it a bottle of shampoo? Yeah. It does look like it. You're right.

289
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:38,099
It looks like a bottle of shampoo. Hey, what do you do? Are you still doing the trial stream?

290
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:44,090
No, unfortunately not. We gave up on that when it got too late, too long, but don't worry.

291
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:51,099
Something way better is going to replace it. And it's going to be, I don't want to ruin it.

292
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:55,079
You're going to like it. It has to do with the dunk tank stream, but there's going to

293
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:05,030
be way more than that. It's been a while since I've done like an elaborate stream,

294
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:10,679
like a produced elaborate stream. This is going to be worth it. I got a really,

295
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:17,800
really, really interesting team involved in this one. What's my favorite TV show?

296
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,400
Curb Your Enthusiasm, Always Suddenly Philadelphia, and Ren and Sniffy.

297
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,510
Deadly Clowns there. I wouldn't say it's a clown stream, but the clowns will be there.

298
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:53,269
Still dead. Damn it. Greenscreen Encore stream is going to be the 29th of June. Yes,

299
00:50:53,269 --> 00:51:02,039
it's coming back. What are my thoughts on Sekiro? I beat it on stream. I did beat Sekiro on stream.

300
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,320
It was great. It was really, really, really fucking hard though. Harder than I think any

301
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,880
of the other games before. And maybe it's because the controls were different and the

302
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,079
game was a little different, but I thought it was harder than any other game that they

303
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:30,710
have made. What are my thoughts on German 985? I think it's all right. When are we getting

304
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,710
a three and four year badge? Bloerdau is right now working on a bunch of new stuff.

305
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:42,230
I've already seen preliminary pieces of it. I think within the next two or three weeks

306
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:49,639
we'll have some more stuff on the channel. What would my fursona be? A frog. We already

307
00:51:49,639 --> 00:52:04,599
talked about this. Come on, come back. I was having fun. Are you going to do something on

308
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:10,150
the 18th? That's my birthday. Dr. Zutzu, we're going to celebrate your birthday. Just

309
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:16,179
pretend. Okay, ready? Clip this. I want Dr. Zutzu to clip this. Hey, what's going

310
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:22,789
on everybody? It is June 18th, 2019. And we are here. We've got a very important day

311
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,670
here. We've got something going on here. We've got Dr. Zutzu's birthday is today.

312
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:39,909
Happy birthday, Dr. Zutzu. It is June 19th. Just wrong date. What was the date? 18th. Cut

313
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:45,659
it. Hey, it's June 18th, 2019. Welcome to the stream, guys. Just turned the stream

314
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:52,179
on for the first time. June 18th, 2019. And yeah, we've got a very important thing

315
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:55,699
going on here. We've got Dr. Zutzu's birthday. First of all, that's really important to say that.

316
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:03,340
June 18th. This is today's date. Happy birthday, Dr. Zutzu. Hell yeah. Can we get some Dr.

317
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:10,820
birthday Zutzu in the chat, please? Happy birthday. Because it's today. Today is the

318
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,309
day. It is June 18th. Today. That's the day it is. All right, come on. Come back.

319
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:43,849
Have you ever peed in somebody else's pants? Yeah, I think so. I had hand

320
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:49,659
be downs for my brother. And when I was like six or seven years old, I definitely peed my pants.

321
00:53:51,190 --> 00:54:07,260
And I peed in my brother's pants. So yes. Yes, I pee pants. You have a brother? I do.

322
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:19,030
I have an older brother and I have an older, I got siblings. How am I feeling tonight? I'm

323
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:34,010
feeling pretty good. All right. Nobody click this machine. What's my least favorite part of

324
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,969
Massachusetts? Well, I don't live there anymore. But when I did live there with the rain,

325
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:44,780
I hated the damn rain. It fucking rained like a hundred days a year in Massachusetts and it

326
00:54:44,780 --> 00:55:33,000
just drove me nuts. Shit. I think we might be out of luck here. Damn it. Time for GeoGuessr.

327
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,659
No, no, we got it. I'll take one more question. One more. I got one more question available

328
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:46,579
here. Did you put MA because you can't spell mass ban that person for life?

329
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:53,219
Oh, German lied about the clown car. Did I? Did I lie about the clown car? You're going

330
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:58,090
to have to change your username in a few weeks. In like a month, in like a month to

331
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:08,920
two months, you're going to have to change your username. It's real. Yes, it is real.

332
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:18,940
DrunkGermaReveals. No, no, no. This is fine. We can talk about this.

333
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:28,179
Without getting more. AdventureMFDan, five community subs. Thank you.

334
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,769
And German lied about clown car. Also community subs. Thank you for that.

335
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:44,360
At some point in August, there is going to be a stream on this channel that's going to be

336
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,679
huge. Lightning Rider, five community subs. Thank you, Lightning Rider.

337
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:53,960
It's actually going to happen now. There's a team of people that are working on this with me.

338
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:57,800
It's taken me a long fucking time to find the right group of people.

339
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,480
I've been trying to get this to work for like almost six to seven months,

340
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,829
talking to people at Twitch, talking to people through help with the producer friend that I

341
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:13,590
have. And finally, I finally got a group of people that kind of know what to do and know

342
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:21,619
how to do it. I know it's been a long time since something elaborate has been done on the

343
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:28,070
stream. It'll make up for it. I promise. I promise that this will make up for like the

344
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:37,719
six to eight months of no big stream. I promise. And it's going to be Sam and Max Season 3.

345
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,400
I finally got a group of people. I got a group of people together to download the game

346
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:51,639
for me and like load it onto my hard drive. No, it's for real. I've talked about this stream

347
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,800
before, but it's much more elaborate. I'm going to put a bunch more time and a bunch more money

348
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:03,349
into it. And if it works, I hope you have a lot of fun on it because it's something I don't

349
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:11,780
think has been done yet so far on this website. He's like talking it up a little.

350
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:18,090
He's talking himself up a little. No, it's going to be fun. Five more subs just came in.

351
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:26,340
Who just gave the five community who just gave five subs? Magellan. Thank you Magellan for the

352
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:32,869
five subs. I talked about it in the discord a little bit earlier like yesterday on another

353
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:43,940
website. Jermis, promise. What did I promise? Eventually at some point before I stop streaming

354
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,420
and doing anything to do with online stuff, I'm going to have a clown car. It's going to

355
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:56,489
happen. It will happen eventually. Yeah. There is going to be a clown car on this stream

356
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:05,460
that I'm talking about right now. I fucking 100% promise. Yes. Thank you The Unravelling

357
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,340
for the two- You have no idea what's going to happen with this. You have no idea.

358
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:20,059
It'll be fun. And if it's not, then I fucking tried. Anyways, it rained like-

359
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:30,019
We've got more subs that came in. Hold on. But I do apologize for the time it's taken

360
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:34,360
to do another one of those streams. The last big stream that was on this channel was-

361
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,980
What the hell was it? It was like the- New Year's Eve? January 1st? That's a long time.

362
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,650
It'll be worth the wait. As long as this works the way that I want it to. It'll be worth the

363
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:58,119
wait. February, March, April, May, June. It's been five damn months. That's too long.

364
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:13,800
All right. Let's do this one. This one is working. This one's not even good.

365
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:59,769
No. No more Senator bullshit. What should I do? Should I type? This one's- I'm just going to read

366
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:06,780
it. Cut is mic now. Let's go. Hey, here we go. We're the Misfits. We're having a blast

367
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,619
playing together here and then we get the opportunity to have a little fun. The fun of

368
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:16,579
putting on a performance. It's totally a new dynamic. This new dimension of who we are

369
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:20,579
having this conversation, this feeling we're doing this for each other, this mutual respect,

370
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:26,469
this intimacy, the love of music. We're so inspired by and feel this chemistry. I feel it.

371
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,130
That's the power of this club and this vibe. There's no question that we're going to hit

372
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:36,250
each other. What? But we're also going to hit each other with our musical abilities that we

373
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,530
share. We're going to give each other props and to use our bodies and our minds. It's

374
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:46,389
the most fun thing we've been doing since the day we came here. And that's where the

375
01:01:46,389 --> 01:01:52,329
fun really begins. If we're going to start it, it'll happen. We'll start with a group dance

376
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:57,210
and see what happens. We definitely won't be stopping until we start it. It's been a fun,

377
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,719
fast learning moment for everyone here. We have fun doing this, but we're not afraid to be

378
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:06,840
ourselves. We're still open-minded. Just go for it. And we're not afraid to play any

379
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:47,190
instruments. Are these lyrics? Nah, this is... I just pulled like the what is Twitch.

380
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:17,210
Is this a real... I don't know if this is a real person. Who is the best streamer on

381
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,579
Twitch? Possible answers for this question, in my opinion, all depend on the game they

382
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:25,909
are making. On the one hand, they could be streamers working through different channels

383
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:30,420
that work around the same time frame. On the other hand, they could be streamers

384
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:36,090
playing different games. Do you know how many streamers you would add back into one channel

385
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:41,769
to fill an existing gap? I'd like to see Twitch TV and any of the smaller stream programs

386
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:48,869
such as The Dude for You add a dedicated one to fill this void. Is there a time limit you

387
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:54,340
think needs to be exceeded during stream hours? Absolutely a time limit. It depends on how big of

388
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,820
a gap you want to fill, how long it takes you to fill that gap, and if you plan on doing that

389
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:04,329
over and over in one run. The best solution for me is having a dedicated channel that I

390
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:08,489
can create for myself on a consistent basis with other streamers. I may create a few

391
01:04:08,489 --> 01:04:12,940
dedicated streams, but most of them are only for personal use when I stream. Where

392
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,539
does your stream come from? Is there anything that you don't want people to see online?

393
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:22,519
No, I don't pay people anything for their time. No one does. My channel is a completely independent

394
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:42,949
one where I own the rights to it. Okay, can I get something out of here? German 95 is the

395
01:04:42,949 --> 01:04:50,309
best stream on Twitch. TV slash twitch.tv slash kiddofly is the best stream on stream. Steam.

396
01:04:50,309 --> 01:05:09,260
You should watch the live stream. Good luck. Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

397
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:34,820
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why? Why is that near? Oh, what the fuck? What? Oh, get the

398
01:05:34,820 --> 01:06:09,539
fuck out of here. Dog shit, come on. Well, alright. Let's uh, let's go back here.

399
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:32,489
Why is that shit gonna come on man? Like what? The fuck. We're gonna have to do a

400
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:56,969
blank screen beforehand now. Come on. What? I'm really glad that I still haven't blacked out.

401
01:06:56,969 --> 01:07:13,210
I still have it gone, because this one wasn't good either. I'm glad it's still on a black screen,

402
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:16,730
so you can't see what... like what the... why are we getting such bad ones now?

403
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:51,269
All right, this is gonna be fine. All right, okay, we're back.

404
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:04,309
My favorite ice cream is the one that tastes totally like ice cream, without all the chocolate

405
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:07,989
flavor. So all those of you who are craving a little more of that flavor, I'd recommend

406
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:12,230
going for the creme de creme. There's always a good chance you'll find one on sale.

407
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:18,869
You know, my favorite chocolate flavor is the chocolate crave. It's like ice cream, but only

408
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:25,109
fair, since it has an added kick of chocolate flavor. Chocolate cream is my favorite, as it's

409
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:30,470
just as tasty as what you'll find at your favorite candy store, only without more flavor,

410
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:36,100
since you get the real experience. Finally, you can also find my favorites, the flavors of

411
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:41,109
the sweet chocolate ice cream, like the one you can find at your local Dairy Queen. They

412
01:08:41,109 --> 01:08:45,270
can be thick and creamy while still being crunchy and chewy, like the ones we found

413
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,789
earlier. So next time you're craving dessert and think about spending some of your money to get

414
01:08:48,789 --> 01:09:57,100
ice cream, you may want to check this section out. Here we go. The takes of the Tomb Raider

415
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:04,119
release date and new DLC content as a result. We're still very excited for our fans to get

416
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:08,600
their hands on a limited edition Fallout 4 t-shirt and collectible mad dog figurine.

417
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:14,789
All we need now is to finish our work on the other add-on content for the game.

418
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:16,229
Source official play- that's it.

419
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,270
Another unknown player.

420
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:17,829
Here we go. I don't know what the fuck that was. I don't know what that was.

421
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:18,869
I don't know what that was.

422
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:39,819
That- what the fuck was- I typed in Fallout 76 music. I'm not gonna get in

423
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:43,220
fucking trouble for this anyway. Yeah, country road.

424
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:56,659
Fallout 76 Battle Royale mode is going to change everything.

425
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:01,779
A true story set in the time when a nuclear war between Earth and the Red Room was breaking out

426
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:08,779
and you are the leader of the resistance. Play as either the protagonist and your trusted henchmen

427
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:14,859
or as a lone ranger or vault dweller. Each will face different challenges and will encounter

428
01:13:14,859 --> 01:13:20,789
different bosses as they go to defend the world from certain forces. They will of course be

429
01:13:20,789 --> 01:13:25,590
accompanied by their companions and if everything goes according to plan, your choice as the

430
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:31,800
story's hero will save the day. The game will take place in a post-nuclear world and every

431
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,439
character is completely independent. Their personalities will determine who they become

432
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:42,920
and how it ends with. Your choices will influence a few other people who live in that world

433
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,880
and affect your survival and the direction of your adventure may lead because there really is

434
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,289
only a few people that still play this game. There's eight people on a server. Your choice

435
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:56,890
as a leader will determine the fate of the people here on Earth and whether they will

436
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:02,970
continue forward. The world you play through is a unique and dynamic landscape and if you're

437
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:08,649
lucky, you'll find a companion. If not, it isn't out of the question that you'll encounter

438
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:13,539
another. There's plenty of time to take care of your companions if you haven't already

439
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:17,140
because that's all you fucking did in Fallout 4. That's the only thing you did. That's all

440
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:21,699
you did. You take care of your town and give them supplies and shit. The action will take

441
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:43,960
place in a huge open world. The entire world will be littered with hidden objects. Cut the

442
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:54,229
mic. Somebody wrote, you really weren't kidding, this really is your worst stream.

443
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:20,859
When I did this fucking card game and how was I supposed to know? I did my damn best. That's

444
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:39,369
all you can do. What happened on 542? What happened on that one? Can't blame somebody

445
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:49,859
for trying. It was, I still had a good time. It's okay. You can't hit a home run. Sometimes

446
01:15:49,859 --> 01:16:07,050
you ground out to the first basement. I still had fun. Do the money phone? What's the money,

447
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:15,960
what's money phone? Money phone? I don't know what that, I don't know what you mean.

448
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:27,220
I didn't rip the cards. What are you talking about? No, I just went like this.

449
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:40,779
I just like shuffled them. He doesn't know. Money phone. I don't know what you mean.

450
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:49,050
I'm going to look at money phone. I'm going to look it up. What's money phone?

451
01:16:51,130 --> 01:17:11,109
Money phone. Holding a stack of cash to your ear and taking a selfie to flex on people. What?

452
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:22,010
What are you talking about? I don't have any money. I don't have any cash here. What do you

453
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:33,659
mean? I have to take a selfie while I go like this? Because I went like this?

454
01:17:34,380 --> 01:18:13,850
All right, I'll do it like that. Tweet it like this. I don't understand what that means.

455
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:21,590
I don't know. I have to hold it to my, I can't do that. I can't hold it to my ear.

456
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:26,840
I'm not going to, why would I tweet that? I tweet like fucking three times a year.

457
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:33,369
Like a phone. I'm not going to hold it up to, I can't take, I can't do that.

458
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:39,500
I mean, I guess I, I'm not doing the money phone. Okay. Get somebody else to do that.

459
01:18:43,720 --> 01:19:11,189
You have to. This stream sucked. God damn it. I'm like sad. I'm sad right now.

460
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,939
Did you at least like think it was a little fun?

461
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:26,579
Well, if you didn't like it, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hope you like the other ones.

462
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:32,279
Hope you like the next one. You're a drunk mess. I am, I am not.

463
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:39,590
Uh, there's not, there's this 15% alcohol by volume in here. I'm going to be just fine.

464
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,319
Um, what? That was six hours. It's been six hours. Can we do any of the little games or something?

465
01:19:47,960 --> 01:20:02,090
What else can we do? I'm not ready to go yet. Not yet.

466
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,930
10 more community subs of cyanide. There was a lot of community subs.

467
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:19,479
I missed some too. Thank you guys. More community subs.

468
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,770
Rvem, thanks for the five. Cyanide, thanks for the 10.

469
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,310
Time to go. No, not yet. Not yet. Maybe like a little bit longer.

470
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:43,350
Flash games. Watch old, you want to watch a few old videos?

471
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,430
You guys thought that was fun last time.

472
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,079
More community. Jerma lied about the clown car. I'm gonna change that name soon.

473
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:08,949
I know I said that earlier, but thank you for the lots of community subs.

474
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,920
Um, it was worth a shot. It was worth a shot. It was fine. It was worth a shot.

475
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,010
It was worth a try. I just farted. No, I didn't. This is Cher.

476
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:43,909
Uh, he just shit his pants. What do we got? Let's go here.

477
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,550
The first one was fun. The second one dragged on for too long.

478
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,789
And the second one was just like all over the place.

479
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,979
Is that a night wing shirt? Yes, it is.

480
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:05,289
Let me open up. Just give me a second. Hold on.

481
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:24,500
Let's just do. No, and that's not no DOS.

482
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:30,699
That'll probably take too long. Let's. I do have to go back to the movies too.

483
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:37,130
Should we just go? Should we go back to the movies like this?

484
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:41,109
This week? What do you guys think?

485
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:47,779
It's been a long time. So I think it's, I think there's more content there to do.

486
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:59,619
I think that'd be fun. Well, what do we got going on tomorrow?

487
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:05,939
Maybe it's, maybe I should just call it six hours.

488
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:11,560
Hmm. I'll give you some insights here.

489
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,250
Yeah, I think, I think we'll call it. I think we will.

490
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:28,600
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Um, let me see.

491
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:35,560
Cause I am actually going to visit somebody. I'm visiting family this time next week.

492
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,970
So we got today, tomorrow. I got some shit planned. Don't worry. It would be good.

493
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:48,539
Old vids. Well, maybe we'll just do a full old video stream like this week coming up.

494
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:00,060
What's going on tomorrow? I have a few options tomorrow.

495
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,979
And then on Tuesday. So we're going to go.

496
01:24:04,699 --> 01:24:11,609
I have some stuff to do on Monday. I've got some work to do on Monday for the channel.

497
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:18,489
I'm getting a call. Uh, but Tuesday, it will be interesting at least.

498
01:24:18,489 --> 01:24:26,220
Tuesday will be that dwarf rock galactic game with star, dwarf rock galactic, whatever it is.

499
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:36,699
Something like that. Deep rock galactic. That's the one.

500
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:40,920
Uh, so tomorrow we'll do, we'll figure something out tomorrow.

501
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,399
There's a few games I could play. We're going to do, uh,

502
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:52,199
Hey, that's, that's to be determined. I'm not going to play days gone tomorrow,

503
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:57,399
but that's it. I'll call it six hours.

504
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,920
Hope you had fun. I hope you thought it was interesting at least.

505
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,239
I know it may have been a little different and maybe, maybe not the best idea,

506
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:10,119
but it wasn't worth a shot. I had fun. I did.

507
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:17,460
And then I had to call it. So thank you for watching. See you tomorrow for something.

508
01:25:19,579 --> 01:25:22,460
Destroy the cards. No, these were expensive. These were fucking expensive.

509
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:23,819
I'm not going to destroy these. They were expensive.

510
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:38,340
These things were like 50 bucks for three decks. Cut as Mike. I'll see you tomorrow.

511
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:43,689
Thanks for watching guys. We'll catch back up tomorrow.

512
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:48,569
Same time, three or four o'clock. It's not that bad for three games.

513
01:25:48,569 --> 01:25:50,409
Yeah, but I don't want to, I'm not going to rip them up.

514
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:58,789
They were still interesting. Where is the, uh, there's the outro.

515
01:26:00,579 --> 01:26:04,279
We had a lot of subs, so thank you all of you.

516
01:26:08,649 --> 01:26:13,449
Let's go back to the bits here. We were earlier this afternoon.

517
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:23,529
Thank you to, uh, Freudian Weapon. Thanks for the eight dolls, Freudian Weapon.

518
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:30,390
Hey, Jeremy, I didn't realize Tuesday was your eight-year internet anniversary.

519
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,350
So happy anniversary. Thanks for eight years of laughs.

520
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,789
You've impacted me more than you could know.

521
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:40,310
I wanted to celebrate properly tonight, but the liquor store was all out of fancy streamer wine.

522
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:43,430
So I had to settle with sponsored YouTuber IPA instead.

523
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:47,180
Well, thank you. Hopefully it was good.

524
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:50,890
It has been eight years. It's been a long time.

525
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:01,000
Sometimes I forget how long that's been. It's been ages.

526
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:06,119
It's almost a decade of being on the internet.

527
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,159
Thanks for the eight bucks, Freudian Weapon.

528
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,279
Thanks for celebrating my eight-year anniversary.

529
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,930
Mr. Sneak Man, thanks for the three dolls and 40 cents.

530
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,210
Hey, Jeremy, great stream as usual.

531
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,979
Starting a TF2 Open team with my buds for the first time.

532
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:28,500
Wish Team Berb good luck so that we can channel Jaxx into our matches.

533
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,220
And if we keep up the good work, have a good night.

534
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,899
Good luck.

535
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:43,739
I wish Team Berb the best of luck in TF2 Open.

536
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:48,649
Thank you, Mr. Sneak Man, for the three dolls and 40 cents.

537
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,729
Thank you to the Overlord of Cookies for the three bucks.

538
01:27:54,729 --> 01:27:56,329
Hey, Jerma, I was wondering if you could help me with something.

539
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:00,170
Me and a friend were hoping to get one of the WWE games

540
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:02,970
so we can make characters and watch them beat each other up like you do.

541
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,640
It just so happens that 2K19 is on sale for 26 bucks Canadian, so $19,

542
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,279
with full price being 60 USD.

543
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:16,199
And your opinion, do you think that we should get it or hold off for another one?

544
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,760
And if no, then which WWE game should we get instead?

545
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:22,520
Thanks and love from Canada.

546
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:26,649
Well, it depends on a few things.

547
01:28:28,699 --> 01:28:31,180
Everything after 2K14 sucks.

548
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:33,420
They're terrible.

549
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,180
The games are fucking awful.

550
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,899
Their customization options are terrible.

551
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,500
But they've run better.

552
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:50,739
Everything before WWE 2K15 runs like shit.

553
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:54,359
But the customization is 10 times better.

554
01:28:57,859 --> 01:28:59,220
So you really have to decide,

555
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:05,500
do you want a game that runs better but has less options?

556
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:14,119
Or a game that runs like crap but has tons and tons of customization options?

557
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:19,000
When you decide that is the game that you should pick.

558
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,430
Yeah, it's right when the console generation switched, yeah.

559
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,220
Unfortunately, it did go downhill.

560
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:32,699
But weirdly enough, I don't know why I'm losing my voice so much recently.

561
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,529
It's like a weird phenomenon.

562
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:40,329
The last two or three weeks, if I talk for more than five or six hours,

563
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:41,689
I just did my voice just drops.

564
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:43,609
I don't know why the fuck this is happening.

565
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:49,479
I don't understand.

566
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:51,159
I'm just getting old.

567
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:58,420
But yeah, that's the best way to determine which one you should play.

568
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:05,880
I was doing this weird old man senator voice for like 20 straight minutes.

569
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,399
Maybe that's what happened.

570
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:08,760
Probably.

571
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:16,739
But yeah, I would pick 2k14 if you've never done it before

572
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,180
because it's way more fun things to do.

573
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,060
But you have to deal with the problem times, like load times.

574
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:24,500
And it looks worse, obviously.

575
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:27,239
But hopefully that answers your question.

576
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,359
C4G, thanks for the 250.

577
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:32,460
Hi, Jerma.

578
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,619
I posted one of your clips on Tumblr a week ago

579
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:38,539
and someone shared it and called you a Himbo.

580
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:40,220
What did they mean by this?

581
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,020
Thanks in advance.

582
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,350
I have no idea.

583
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:45,369
I don't know what that means.

584
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:52,579
What did I do?

585
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:53,380
Did I do something wrong?

586
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:59,640
Caught the mic.

587
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,199
What did I do?

588
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:00,680
Caught the mic.

589
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,079
Caught the mic.

590
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:01,560
What did I do?

591
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,229
He doesn't know.

592
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:05,189
I don't know.

593
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:05,989
I really don't know.

594
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,840
An attractive but unintelligent man.

595
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:18,899
A place, come on.

596
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,319
I am not unintelligent.

597
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:27,720
I'm just...

598
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,060
It's all right.

599
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,020
It's okay.

600
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:40,789
But are you attractive though?

601
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,229
I don't know.

602
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,069
That's up to whoever.

603
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:51,109
The jury's out on that one.

604
01:31:51,109 --> 01:31:53,670
It wasn't an insult.

605
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:53,989
I know.

606
01:31:53,989 --> 01:31:55,189
I'm just playing around.

607
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:59,539
Spliceable Spleen, thanks for the $5.

608
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:01,220
Hey, Jerma, just graduated from university today

609
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,100
and wanted to show you some love

610
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,020
for getting me through some tough times.

611
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,939
Keep creating amazing content and I'll be here.

612
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,079
Thank you to the $5, Spliceable Spleen.

613
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:11,000
Congratulations on graduating university.

614
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:14,409
Much love to you.

615
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:15,930
Thanks for being around.

616
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:20,329
And I'm happy you think that this is good.

617
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:23,739
That makes me happy.

618
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:26,500
I hope you still think so.

619
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,539
I hope you stick around.

620
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:28,739
I hope you still think it's fun.

621
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:29,380
I really do.

622
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,010
I hope you still think I'm handsome.

623
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,449
I hope you still think I'm handsome.

624
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:37,420
But thanks for the $5.

625
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:46,649
Thank you to GTX 1080 Quad SLI for the $2.50.

626
01:32:47,449 --> 01:32:52,010
Hey, Leo, I was wondering when you were going to do more VR or Dreams.

627
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:53,609
It's been a while.

628
01:32:54,329 --> 01:32:57,210
And I'd love to see more epic wins and fails, JermaTV.

629
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
I will probably go back to VR.

630
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,899
The week after next.

631
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:08,260
So the week of like the 24th.

632
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:09,699
I'll go back to VR.

633
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:12,810
And we will do VR for a whole week.

634
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:15,720
I just, I needed to take a break from it.

635
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,079
It was kind of killing me for a while.

636
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:24,140
But that week of the 24th.

637
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,260
And what about Dreams?

638
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,140
Uh, Dreams is, I would probably do channel surfing on Dreams.

639
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:34,439
I feel like I can't dedicate the time necessary to make anything interesting.

640
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,260
I tried to, but just kind of wasn't happening.

641
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:43,609
And I'd rather dedicate time to other things.

642
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:52,039
Like, for instance, the dunk tank stream with all the other games thing.

643
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,239
So that's my off stream shit.

644
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:00,500
That's what I'm going to be doing off stream, at least for the next few weeks.

645
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:07,340
And that has evolved by two or three times.

646
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:16,020
So in the time when I'm not live on camera, I'm going to be working on that.

647
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:20,420
So instead of doing something like Dreams and making stuff,

648
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,380
I'm doing that instead.

649
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:24,020
Because that just got a lot of traction here in the last like three or four days.

650
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,579
But yeah, something like that.

651
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:33,819
Thank you though for the five dollars, uh, of the 250, sorry, GTX 1080.

652
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,159
Swiggity swanky, thanks for the five dollars.

653
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:38,920
Dr. Jerma, I have a problem with my ear.

654
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,760
I've recovered from a cold and I've noticed that there's still fluid stuck in my inner left ear.

655
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,640
That was three weeks ago and it still won't drain.

656
01:34:46,539 --> 01:34:49,260
Has that ever happened to you in your 30 years of life experience?

657
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:49,760
Yes.

658
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,010
Uh, I'm going to tell you something.

659
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:55,880
This is not medical advice.

660
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,600
I am not a doctor.

661
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:02,779
This is not medical advice.

662
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,739
But first of all, go to a doctor.

663
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,810
I am not a doctor, not at all.

664
01:35:11,449 --> 01:35:13,529
I have no idea what I'm doing.

665
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:16,569
This is, do not use this as medical advice.

666
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:24,180
But every time I've had water in my ear or fluid in my ear,

667
01:35:24,899 --> 01:35:26,979
this is not medical advice.

668
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:28,739
Do not do this.

669
01:35:29,539 --> 01:35:31,300
This is something you should not do.

670
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:32,340
Don't ever do this.

671
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:33,939
Under any circumstance.

672
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:35,779
That's what I'm telling you, to not do this.

673
01:35:37,939 --> 01:35:43,930
Uh, is I do hydrogen peroxide in my ear and lie with it in my ear for like a few minutes.

674
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:47,800
Do not do that.

675
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:49,739
Never do it.

676
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:51,100
Don't ever fucking do that.

677
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,020
In a, don't ever do that.

678
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:53,520
Okay?

679
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:02,039
That's actually fine.

680
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:03,319
No, I'm gonna go do it right now.

681
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:07,029
You gotta be careful though, you know?

682
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,380
Ow, my ears.

683
01:36:16,649 --> 01:36:18,649
I told you not to do that, so don't worry.

684
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,090
I've, I've protected myself.

685
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:24,069
But thank you.

686
01:36:24,069 --> 01:36:26,789
Also thank you, but it's five dollars from spickety swanky.

687
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:28,760
Go to a doctor, they, they know what they're doing.

688
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:34,949
Cyanide Zero gave fucking a hundred bucks and a shitload of community subs,

689
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:36,949
so I gotta say right off the bat, thank you Cyanide.

690
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,359
Atrolux A-Trux gave a shitload of subs too, a lot of community subs tonight.

691
01:36:44,489 --> 01:36:47,050
Alamitos, Alamitos, thanks for the 250.

692
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:52,970
Local streamer by the name of German 986 was arrested after plagiarizing a garden

693
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:54,569
from an innocent person and house slipper.

694
01:36:55,529 --> 01:36:57,770
German was on the run from the police for a few weeks,

695
01:36:58,489 --> 01:37:03,369
but was caught after the police got a tip from another streamer named Grill Master X Barbecue.

696
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,930
A man by the name of Mario said,

697
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:10,329
German has not been the same mentally ever since I destroyed him in Yahtzee.

698
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:12,649
I didn't even do the Mario voice.

699
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:14,250
I just like talked like Mario.

700
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:16,250
I just did Mario cadences.

701
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:17,529
I didn't even try.

702
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:22,250
That was just a guy talking.

703
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,369
It wasn't even Mario.

704
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:28,859
But thank you.

705
01:37:29,859 --> 01:37:31,859
Thank you Atrolux A-Trux for the 10 bucks.

706
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:33,140
You're all breathtaking.

707
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,920
You're breathtaking.

708
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,460
That's what I need to say, right?

709
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:40,340
Too drunk?

710
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,140
No, I'm not drunk.

711
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,340
I'm just my voice is gone.

712
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,760
It's like getting worse too.

713
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,119
I hope it's not like this tomorrow.

714
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:50,260
I'll be in some fucking trouble tomorrow if I can't talk.

715
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,390
I'm not getting like laryngitis, right?

716
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:57,420
Why would that be happening?

717
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:05,539
No, I'll be all right.

718
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,310
Thank you for the 10 bucks though, Atrolux.

719
01:38:13,239 --> 01:38:14,279
You're all breathtaking.

720
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:19,109
Oh, we also had Pigeon.

721
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:20,310
Thank you Pigeon for the 250.

722
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,149
Hey, Jerma, I was looking for Switch games to buy.

723
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:23,430
Uh, Switch games.

724
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:25,109
And I stumbled upon this.

725
01:38:25,909 --> 01:38:29,829
It's like Space Channel 5, but you actually have to move.

726
01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:31,189
I thought it'd be a really great stream.

727
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:33,750
Plus you could finally get back to 2015 Jerma.

728
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,310
2015?

729
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:37,029
Jerma, what do you mean?

730
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:41,050
All Jermas are good Jermas.

731
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:41,689
They're all fine.

732
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:42,489
They're all good Jermas.

733
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:42,970
What's wrong with that?

734
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:44,649
What's wrong with the 2019 Jerma?

735
01:38:45,739 --> 01:38:46,140
Teen!

736
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,020
Oh, this is getting bad.

737
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:49,020
What the fuck is wrong with me?

738
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,439
Fuck.

739
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:57,100
Oh, here's the link.

740
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,300
Pigeon with five dollars.

741
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,739
Fitness Boxing Switch.

742
01:39:03,779 --> 01:39:04,579
Interesting, okay.

743
01:39:07,529 --> 01:39:09,130
Space Channel 5, but boxing.

744
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:10,819
I'm gonna have to have a tea.

745
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:14,890
But uh, thank you Pigeon for the five bucks.

746
01:39:16,279 --> 01:39:17,720
Thank you Freudian Weapon for the 250.

747
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,960
For the record, I did enjoy these unlock card games.

748
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,560
I may even check them out for myself.

749
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,439
I'm glad you did.

750
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:27,420
It was an interesting idea.

751
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:33,180
I can't pretend that every idea that I have to do on stream is gonna be worth really doing,

752
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,100
but I think I still had fun doing it.

753
01:39:35,899 --> 01:39:45,640
It's something that I wanted to try for a little while, so it's okay.

754
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,180
As long as you enjoy yourselves, that's all I care about.

755
01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:50,380
Because I enjoyed myself too.

756
01:39:51,529 --> 01:39:53,930
But thank you Freudian Weapon for the 250.

757
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,460
Door Cube, thanks for the 250.

758
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,220
These unlock games look like something that my nerdy aunt and uncle

759
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,899
would have funded on Kickstarter.

760
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:05,539
Play it once and then give it to me for Christmas.

761
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:13,989
Oh, that's true.

762
01:40:13,989 --> 01:40:15,189
That's very true.

763
01:40:15,829 --> 01:40:16,149
Yep.

764
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,079
Yeah, you know, you got it.

765
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:19,960
That's...

766
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:26,020
Hey, guess what I'm gonna do with these.

767
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:30,039
They're gonna get boxed back up and they're going to my nieces and nephews.

768
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,729
I had that idea like an hour and a half ago.

769
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:39,909
I'm gonna be that uncle.

770
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:43,930
But I didn't buy them on Kickstarter.

771
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:44,569
But they're good.

772
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:45,210
What's wrong with them?

773
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:46,250
What do you mean that's so mean?

774
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,090
These are like fun card games.

775
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:49,689
Things.

776
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,840
But thank you Door Cube.

777
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:59,819
Thank you Halo Soft Boy for the 250.

778
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:00,539
Thank you for streaming.

779
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,979
Your streams have been a really positive thing in my life lately.

780
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:05,579
As I've been going through some crazy stuff.

781
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:08,949
I witnessed a shooting a week ago.

782
01:41:08,949 --> 01:41:11,189
But your streams in the stream archive have been helping me relax

783
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:12,229
and take my mind off things.

784
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:13,189
I'm really fucking sorry to hear.

785
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:14,069
That's fucking horrible.

786
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:17,529
Now the house flipper streams have been my favorite.

787
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:18,409
Thanks for doing what you do.

788
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:21,770
I'm...

789
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:22,729
That's fucking horrible.

790
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:31,720
Thank you for hanging out here.

791
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,479
Hopefully you're all right.

792
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:35,079
Hopefully everyone's okay.

793
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,369
I don't know what you're referring to here.

794
01:41:39,369 --> 01:41:40,489
But hopefully everything's okay.

795
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:42,810
But that's fucking terrible.

796
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:51,800
Thank you for hanging out.

797
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,970
And I'm glad that this can be a community of somewhere to relax.

798
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:01,180
I'm okay.

799
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:01,739
Thanks.

800
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:02,220
That's good.

801
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,859
That's good.

802
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:03,579
That's good to know.

803
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:11,340
Take care and thank you.

804
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,340
And moving on from that.

805
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,819
We're gonna do Pasta Globs had 250 here.

806
01:42:19,909 --> 01:42:20,470
Hi Jerma.

807
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:21,670
Your streams never failed to cheer me up.

808
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:23,510
So I thought I would show my appreciation with some art.

809
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:24,710
Hope you like it.

810
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,260
It's pretty damn good.

811
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:34,329
Get it on the screen.

812
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:41,350
What do you say?

813
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,470
Pasta Globs.

814
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,789
This hair.

815
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:51,590
Look at this hair.

816
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,119
I gotta do something about this hair.

817
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,939
It's starting to get all over the place.

818
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:57,899
It's starting to go crazy.

819
01:42:59,739 --> 01:43:01,750
This is great.

820
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,149
Thank you.

821
01:43:02,789 --> 01:43:08,890
That was Pasta Globs.

822
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:10,409
Thank you for the 250 and thanks for the art.

823
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:12,970
You look like Prince Charming.

824
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,659
Thank you.

825
01:43:17,659 --> 01:43:21,319
Grow it out more.

826
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:21,880
I can't.

827
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,000
I would look like David Spade.

828
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,640
Thank you Pasta Globs.

829
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,699
We had lightning rider with five community subs.

830
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:32,060
Pogefest five community subs.

831
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:34,779
It was a lot that just flew in sub-wise.

832
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:37,340
DC Pro.

833
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,300
Thanks for 10 bucks.

834
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:38,859
No message.

835
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:40,220
Just 10 dollars from DC Pro.

836
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,460
Actually no, there is a message.

837
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,060
Hey Jerma, I found your channel when I was 16.

838
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,140
Now three years later I want to thank you for all the laughs.

839
01:43:46,779 --> 01:43:50,069
Thanks for being around.

840
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:52,939
I've been watching for three years.

841
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:57,420
Thank you for the 11 bucks.

842
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,359
And thanks for watching.

843
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:04,170
Hope you stay tuned.

844
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:09,020
Then we had a Dork Cube 250.

845
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,100
The card game may have been the worst stream,

846
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:16,840
but the moment when you said my wife left our family a year before I did,

847
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,520
it became the best stream.

848
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,920
I call this predicament Schrodinger's stream.

849
01:44:32,819 --> 01:44:38,039
Yeah, it's okay though.

850
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:40,340
It's okay.

851
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,739
I'm completely content with the card games.

852
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:50,649
It wasn't bad.

853
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:55,130
I know, but I look, I don't like to disappoint people.

854
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:59,659
And I know nobody's actually disappointed.

855
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:04,359
But I want every stream to be fun and happy,

856
01:45:04,359 --> 01:45:06,840
and people interested and want to watch.

857
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,779
And if you see somebody that says,

858
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:10,819
I don't like this, then it's like,

859
01:45:10,819 --> 01:45:13,699
fuck, I wish, I wish you did.

860
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:18,100
Now for the most part, people thought it was interesting.

861
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,619
And you know, but still, you know, I,

862
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,170
it's something I think about a lot.

863
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:23,850
I care about that shit.

864
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,409
I really do.

865
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,279
More than anything.

866
01:45:29,819 --> 01:45:31,899
I don't give a shit about anything else.

867
01:45:31,899 --> 01:45:33,420
I only fucking care about that.

868
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:33,899
That's it.

869
01:45:34,939 --> 01:45:35,659
Nothing else.

870
01:45:39,989 --> 01:45:41,350
I really hope you know that.

871
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:48,819
Not even Kim.

872
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,439
No, come on.

873
01:45:52,439 --> 01:45:53,000
Come on.

874
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,039
Come on.

875
01:45:58,359 --> 01:45:59,159
Oh, Jesus.

876
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,659
Let's get, there was a lot of community subs.

877
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:07,619
Let's get the credits on screen.

878
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:10,340
We're almost done with the bits, but let's roll these up.

879
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:12,699
And they go, there was a lot.

880
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,579
There was like hundreds.

881
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,899
It was like two or three hundreds up tonight.

882
01:46:26,869 --> 01:46:28,630
You don't care about, no, no, no, no, no, no.

883
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:29,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

884
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:30,470
No, guys, guys, what have you done?

885
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,390
Guys, what have you done to me?

886
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,539
This is not, this is not, come on.

887
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,979
She's sitting here watching the stream.

888
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:46,979
No, you listen.

889
01:46:47,779 --> 01:46:49,380
I'll talk to you in like five, five minutes.

890
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,140
Don't listen to the chatters.

891
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:54,260
They've lost all control.

892
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:03,100
But in real talk, in real words here,

893
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:10,470
the reason why I do like the card game stream is because I

894
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:12,869
want to see if I can make something interesting.

895
01:47:12,869 --> 01:47:15,829
You know, it seems like something fun to do.

896
01:47:22,789 --> 01:47:24,149
Better warm up that couch.

897
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:30,310
Yeah, it's all good.

898
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:32,390
It's all good.

899
01:47:33,029 --> 01:47:34,869
It's all fucking gravy.

900
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,939
And another thing.

901
01:47:37,939 --> 01:47:39,220
Let me tell you another thing.

902
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:51,500
I, turn it back, turn it back on.

903
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:53,100
Don't do that to me again.

904
01:47:53,659 --> 01:47:55,369
You understand, this is my fucking stream.

905
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:56,170
Don't do that to me again.

906
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:00,939
Fucking aliens upstairs trying to control it.

907
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:01,899
You keep, keep it on.

908
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:03,500
I'm not fucking around.

909
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,140
Keep that shit on.

910
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:08,600
And another thing.

911
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:11,029
That's all I got.

912
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:13,029
Hey, thank you too.

913
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:14,869
It's a ghost party for the five dollars.

914
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:17,859
Hey, Jerma, every stream you do is great.

915
01:48:17,859 --> 01:48:19,619
And it's a pleasure to see you doing what you want.

916
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:20,819
Don't let the haters get...

917
01:48:20,819 --> 01:48:22,899
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody.

918
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:25,319
No, there was no haters.

919
01:48:27,619 --> 01:48:28,100
That wasn't...

920
01:48:29,619 --> 01:48:36,649
That's not it.

921
01:48:36,649 --> 01:48:37,770
There were one or two.

922
01:48:38,329 --> 01:48:38,890
That's all right.

923
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:39,369
That's okay.

924
01:48:43,529 --> 01:48:44,810
You can't please everybody.

925
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:46,649
When you see that one guy complain, don't let it get to you.

926
01:48:46,649 --> 01:48:48,170
Only makes you more of a boomer.

927
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:48,890
No, no, no, no.

928
01:48:49,529 --> 01:48:50,170
I'm fine.

929
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:51,210
I'm just fine.

930
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:51,609
Don't worry.

931
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,539
I was one of the haters.

932
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,300
You understand?

933
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,340
I'm going to flip this on you.

934
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:01,289
I was one...

935
01:49:01,289 --> 01:49:01,770
It was me.

936
01:49:02,649 --> 01:49:03,210
It was me.

937
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:06,039
It wasn't in chat.

938
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:06,520
It was me.

939
01:49:13,529 --> 01:49:14,810
You're your biggest hater.

940
01:49:18,579 --> 01:49:19,380
It was me.

941
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:21,060
I was the one.

942
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,180
It was the mirror.

943
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,460
The mirror held up in front of me.

944
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,300
It was like, oh, shit, it's been me the whole time.

945
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:36,630
You were those thousands of people.

946
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:40,409
But there was a lot of subs.

947
01:49:40,409 --> 01:49:40,890
Thank you, guys.

948
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,319
We have a few more bits to get through.

949
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,340
But it's a ghost party thanks to the five dollars.

950
01:49:58,460 --> 01:49:59,340
It's not...

951
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:00,220
Nobody was like that.

952
01:50:00,779 --> 01:50:01,819
We were just having a good time.

953
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,579
I just sometimes think...

954
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:05,779
Overthink.

955
01:50:07,239 --> 01:50:14,579
If people are having a good time, you know?

956
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:17,220
Because it's what I fucking care about the most.

957
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,770
It's not the money.

958
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:21,130
It's not the fucking view count.

959
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:22,970
It's not the worst view count, right?

960
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:23,529
It's not that was...

961
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:25,130
It's nothing.

962
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:26,010
I'm not about that at all.

963
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:32,619
Money.

964
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:32,939
Money.

965
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:33,420
Oh, shit.

966
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,220
I said the word money.

967
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,619
You don't want any more money?

968
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:46,569
I look fucking greasy.

969
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:59,659
Naked streamer.

970
01:50:59,659 --> 01:51:03,260
No.

971
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,020
But only a couple more bits to do.

972
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:07,880
And then I should see you tomorrow.

973
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,239
Unless for some reason something's wrong.

974
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:10,439
Because I don't think anything will be wrong.

975
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,949
I almost lost my mind at the beginning of the stream, though.

976
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:16,409
It was kind of fucked up.

977
01:51:21,859 --> 01:51:23,699
Any main channel uploads in progress?

978
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:26,500
No, but there is a main Twitch stream coming up.

979
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:30,020
That includes Dunk Tank and some other things.

980
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:35,239
That should be happening sooner than I think.

981
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:40,970
But thank you to Magellan for the five dollars.

982
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,810
Hey man, just want to jump in and say thank you for the stream tonight.

983
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:45,930
As rocky as it was, I really needed it.

984
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:47,689
And enjoyed it a lot regardless.

985
01:51:47,689 --> 01:51:50,569
Even in your worst dreams and of being a gold mine of entertainment.

986
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:53,770
Also, I made a dumb video of your moment earlier.

987
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:54,250
Enjoy.

988
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:55,850
Not a screamer.

989
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,130
Just turn the volume down.

990
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:58,569
Well, that's kind of a funny warning.

991
01:51:59,619 --> 01:52:00,500
Not a screamer.

992
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:02,489
Oh, it's...

993
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:03,529
I'm the screamer.

994
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:04,029
I get it.

995
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:15,460
When did I do this?

996
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,239
What?

997
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:34,039
I feel a little bit better.

998
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:42,119
I feel a little bit better.

999
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:59,020
Oh, because I was pissed off at the fucked up Twitch server.

1000
01:53:00,229 --> 01:53:01,270
Right, right, okay, okay.

1001
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:03,050
Well, that was Magellan.

1002
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,850
Thanks for the five dollars.

1003
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:04,970
Thanks for the video.

1004
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:06,949
Hope you enjoyed it.

1005
01:53:06,949 --> 01:53:09,989
Thank you Anything Else Show Official for the five bucks.

1006
01:53:10,710 --> 01:53:14,069
This was a different stream for sure, but it was still funny and unexpected.

1007
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:18,470
I'm still sick, but your goofy humor has healed me a little.

1008
01:53:19,029 --> 01:53:22,310
Also, if you're playing the movies, I recommend checking out the mod site.

1009
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:24,710
So you can put in some random and funny shit as usual.

1010
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:25,909
Have fun, you goober.

1011
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:28,789
Thank you Anything Else Show Official.

1012
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:32,550
Oh, right.

1013
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:34,060
That's wrong.

1014
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,939
The movies might even just be the next stream.

1015
01:53:37,579 --> 01:53:40,699
What's tomorrow?

1016
01:53:40,699 --> 01:53:41,100
Sunday?

1017
01:53:45,159 --> 01:53:56,460
I mean, it might be tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, okay.

1018
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:58,619
Maybe we'll just do that tomorrow.

1019
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,039
Maybe we'll just do it tomorrow.

1020
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:10,949
That would make some sense, right?

1021
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:14,520
We'll see.

1022
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:18,039
Well, if I can get that to work and I can get some mods and stuff maybe, yeah.

1023
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:18,840
Let me try it out.

1024
01:54:19,989 --> 01:54:22,789
If not, then we'll do that at some point in the next week for sure.

1025
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:28,920
Let me see what I can do with that tomorrow, but thank you.

1026
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:31,640
Only a couple more.

1027
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:32,199
Frodium Weapon.

1028
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:33,399
Thanks for the five dollars, Frodium.

1029
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:37,239
Every stream is fron- fron in one way or another to a lot of people.

1030
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,920
Your breathtaking.

1031
01:54:41,909 --> 01:54:43,189
Thank you so much for the five bucks.

1032
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,340
I do think about that a lot.

1033
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,859
Thank you for the five dollars, Frodium.

1034
01:54:48,579 --> 01:54:49,460
Captain Fawful.

1035
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:50,260
Thanks for the five bucks.

1036
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:53,380
I was one of the comments you read about this being your worst stream.

1037
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,779
It was just a joke and I didn't mean it.

1038
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:58,979
You could do a stream where you would do nothing but eat Cheerios and I would still love it.

1039
01:54:58,979 --> 01:54:59,939
Keep up the great work.

1040
01:55:00,579 --> 01:55:01,619
That's why- I know, I know.

1041
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:07,859
Look, nothing anybody said in the chat tonight was a catalyst for this.

1042
01:55:08,739 --> 01:55:11,619
I just- it's just something that concerns me.

1043
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:14,279
Don't give them any ideas.

1044
01:55:16,069 --> 01:55:17,109
Every stream is fron.

1045
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:22,340
But thank you, Captain Fawful.

1046
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,420
No, nobody said anything that I didn't like.

1047
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,260
Oh, where the heck's everybody's such a mean?

1048
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:26,819
No, no, no, no.

1049
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:27,380
No, no, no, no.

1050
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:28,180
I hope you don't think that.

1051
01:55:28,819 --> 01:55:30,869
But thank you for the five dollars.

1052
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:33,989
Stanktron.

1053
01:55:33,989 --> 01:55:34,710
Thanks for the two and fifty.

1054
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:36,869
Hey, Jeremiah, I recently went to a museum in Queens

1055
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,590
where I saw a Jim Henson exhibit.

1056
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:41,989
It showcased all the original Muppets in Sesame Street,

1057
01:55:41,989 --> 01:55:43,989
Fraggle Rock, Puppets, etc.

1058
01:55:43,989 --> 01:55:45,430
I noticed you referenced them a lot.

1059
01:55:46,069 --> 01:55:47,829
Thanks, because Jim Henson is probably the most-

1060
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:53,460
well, one of the most important media personalities to ever live.

1061
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:57,880
So, I mean, Jim Henson is-

1062
01:55:59,239 --> 01:56:01,560
we wouldn't have so many of these things without Jim Henson.

1063
01:56:02,199 --> 01:56:04,069
You want to talk about influences?

1064
01:56:04,069 --> 01:56:06,390
I think Jim Henson might be up there for me at least.

1065
01:56:07,029 --> 01:56:10,170
He did a lot of really, really great things.

1066
01:56:11,659 --> 01:56:13,100
So, that's awesome.

1067
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:13,899
Glad you got to see it.

1068
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:21,239
The Muppets are completely timeless.

1069
01:56:21,239 --> 01:56:21,739
Forever.

1070
01:56:22,279 --> 01:56:27,399
Glad you got to see it, Stanktron.

1071
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:32,279
Just got here. Am I late to the stream?

1072
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,420
Eh, by a little bit.

1073
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,979
A Freudian weapon right now.

1074
01:56:38,979 --> 01:56:39,779
Two-fifty, that's right.

1075
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:41,699
I'm going to be that guy and be the last bits.

1076
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:42,260
Have a good night.

1077
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:42,979
Well, that's not true.

1078
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:47,189
Because unfortunately, deusmorte gave two-fifty.

1079
01:56:51,319 --> 01:56:51,640
They said,

1080
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,319
Jerma, that was possibly the worst stream ever.

1081
01:56:53,319 --> 01:56:56,039
The Birdhouse stream deserves an award after that one.

1082
01:56:57,079 --> 01:56:57,560
Just kidding.

1083
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,119
Love you, baby.

1084
01:56:58,119 --> 01:56:58,840
Keep doing what you love.

1085
01:56:59,239 --> 01:57:12,739
I played a goddamn card game and I had fun.

1086
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:18,300
And I drank sake every card pull.

1087
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,659
And I got five thousand subs.

1088
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:26,020
Because I'd beat the game in so six seconds.

1089
01:57:26,659 --> 01:57:30,260
Clueless sniper, two-fifty.

1090
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:31,140
No, I'm that guy.

1091
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:32,979
You are now.

1092
01:57:40,069 --> 01:57:41,109
All right, all right, all right.

1093
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:42,229
I'll probably see you guys tomorrow.

1094
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:46,970
In the extreme odd event that I wake up tomorrow

1095
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:48,329
with a hangover for some reason.

1096
01:57:48,329 --> 01:57:50,329
I don't, this is like, I don't think it will happen.

1097
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:54,500
Did I, I drank the whole bottle though.

1098
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:59,260
Did I? I did.

1099
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:05,060
We're gonna play the goddamn movies.

1100
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:08,779
It's just, it's sake.

1101
01:58:08,779 --> 01:58:10,060
It's not that, it's not that alcoholic.

1102
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,460
Don't worry.

1103
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:16,229
I'll eat like a fucking couple pieces of bread.

1104
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:16,710
I'll be fine.

1105
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:26,060
24-hour movie stream.

1106
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:28,649
I don't know about that.

1107
01:58:31,029 --> 01:58:31,909
No, I'll be fine.

1108
01:58:31,909 --> 01:58:32,470
No, no, no, no, no.

1109
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:32,789
We're good.

1110
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:35,750
Expect either the movies or something else tomorrow.

1111
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:39,750
Freudian Weapon gave two-fifty.

1112
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:40,470
We shall see.

1113
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:43,189
Freudian Weapon is now the last bits of the night.

1114
01:58:49,859 --> 01:58:50,739
Drunk streamer.

1115
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:55,619
I'll be a little, I'll be like eight percent.

1116
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,640
Maybe eight percent drunk.

1117
01:59:04,069 --> 01:59:04,789
That's my time.

1118
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:07,819
Thank you for watching as always.

1119
01:59:07,819 --> 01:59:09,819
I'll see you guys probably tomorrow.

1120
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:14,180
We'll do something fun.

1121
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:18,539
That was Unlock, a murder mystery.

1122
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:23,060
It's going right into the trash.

1123
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:25,609
Just kidding.

1124
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:26,899
Take care.

1125
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:29,319
Probably see you tomorrow.

1126
01:59:29,319 --> 01:59:52,409
Oh, guild mates and stream legends.

1127
01:59:52,409 --> 01:59:52,810
That's right.

1128
01:59:53,449 --> 02:00:00,420
I will take care of you guys.

1129
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:00,979
Yes, I will.

1130
02:00:06,069 --> 02:00:06,630
Here you go.

1131
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:11,029
There you go.

1132
02:00:11,029 --> 02:00:12,409
All right.

1133
02:00:12,409 --> 02:00:13,130
Take care, guys.

1134
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:13,850
See you soon.
