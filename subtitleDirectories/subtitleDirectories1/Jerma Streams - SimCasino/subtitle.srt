1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:20,140
Yes, yes, I know that you were expecting Christmas dinner tonight, and instead you walked in the door, hung your coat up, you looked around the room, looked around the kitchen, and there was nothing in the oven.

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:39,649
There was no trays out with foil on them. There was no atmosphere that there was any food, and you were told now when you came in, yes, we're going to be having microwaved pizzas tonight.

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:01:03,229
Hello! Hi, how are you? Welcome. Welcome to the stream. Some of you may be confused by the title and the game that's on that title.

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:12,900
And a lot of you might be wondering, man, what does that microphone sure does sound better, doesn't it? That sounds a lot different. That sounds much cleaner, doesn't it?

5
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,569
I'd like to see ones in chat if you can tell me if it sounds very clean and very new and refreshing to you.

6
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:43,560
Alright, so let me tell you what I did. Finally, finally, finally, I know, I know, finally, I didn't do anything. I lied. You see what I'm saying? Do you understand now? I didn't do anything.

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:54,620
It's the exact same mic, the exact same setup, nothing fucking changed. Not one thing changed. It's the exact same microphone.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:08,289
You know, like, 2020 hindsight, but here's the thing. I need to, I might just do it and I don't even care, like just the few thousand of you that are here right now, just don't, just quiet about it.

9
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:25,650
If I had like an audio tech guy come on stream and do a bunch of shit, and he'll put up a bunch of shit on the stream, I'll capture it on OBS, moving knobs left and right, having a big pair of headphones on, raising the, you know, on the equalizer.

10
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:37,300
Yep, that's better. Keep talking. Keep talking. And I don't change fucking any settings. Like the next day, people are just going to think that it's better when he didn't do anything. It was an actor.

11
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:55,870
I should have just done that. But yes, no, we have a lot to talk about. Oh boy, do we have a lot to talk about. Okay, so here, let's start, let's start with the bad news.

12
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:07,419
The bad news is today was going to be Green Screen Movie Night Part 2, but it's not. There's nothing wrong with the playlist. Everything's done. It's ready to go.

13
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:21,280
It's been ready for the last few days, from my understanding. The problem was I got up today and a problem I've been having recently, you guys know that the last week or two has been kind of a pain in the ass.

14
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,430
COVID kind of came through the house and I didn't get it, but maybe I did. I don't know.

15
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:38,840
And ever since, I've been getting these digestive problems and these fucking headaches. And I woke up today and I had one of these annoying headaches.

16
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:50,669
And if I were to laugh really, really hard like we did last week or whatever week before, I would have to turn the stream off in like 40 minutes.

17
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:59,659
So I've got kind of an issue in my brain today and I knew for a fact that it would be a bad idea.

18
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:12,289
So if I were to watch two or three of those videos and they were really funny, I might have to just leave and turn it off.

19
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,959
But here's the good news. It's not like, oh, it's over. You're never going to see it.

20
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,959
No, it's just whenever in the next probably few days or in the next, maybe next weekend or something.

21
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:34,060
Because let me tell you something. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We have this stream every single day next week, pretty much.

22
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,529
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So it's a packed week.

23
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:45,829
And the reason why I'm doing that is not just because there's a lot of fun stuff to do with, you know, friends and streamers and stuff.

24
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:54,069
It's the baseball show is the 19th of this month. So I want to get a lot of streams.

25
00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:01,980
So because I'm obviously not you're not going to see me for a little while after after next weekend.

26
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:14,930
You are going to not see me till baseball. You don't want to laugh, but you're going to play this sim casino game.

27
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, here's the difference, right?

28
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,430
There's there's there's laughing at like somebody, you know, puking on the floor in the casino game, whatever.

29
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:34,490
And then there is I don't I can't stop laughing or I can't stop having a major reaction to like three to five straight minutes of video.

30
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,500
And I like I do remember last time I was dying last time.

31
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:49,100
So I think it's going to be a little different. It killed me, too. Yeah.

32
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:56,879
And I'll be honest, too. I'd rather be in a better state on like an important special fun night like that.

33
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,180
I don't want to just be kind of like, oh, yeah, I feel like shit.

34
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Let's do that thing that, you know, I've been looking forward to for, you know, months.

35
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,360
No, no, fuck that. You know what I mean?

36
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,560
And I know I know it's disappointing. I think it'd be more fun that way.

37
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I don't want to just I'd rather be able to enjoy it. Right.

38
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,470
But so we're going to his his plan. We're going to do this today. We play sim casino.

39
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,839
I'm not going to laugh, but I probably am.

40
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,209
I will explain the tweet, by the way.

41
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:33,209
A lot of people are confused by my last tweet, you know, one one tweet a year.

42
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,959
Andy, I will explain that because there's a lot of people saying, what are you even talking about?

43
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,959
Who's he even talking to? Why is he saying this?

44
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,420
OK, let's explain that real quick.

45
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,339
If you have an iPhone and you open up an app called Pages, you can do it right now literally while you're sitting and listening to this.

46
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:56,459
Open up Pages and go to, you know, new like I'm going to make a new document.

47
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,649
Click on templates, choose template and then new note.

48
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:07,269
And it's just a fucking spell. It's like it's just Latin.

49
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:11,410
So what I had to have done is I have a ton of notes.

50
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,709
Right. Because anytime I think of like a stream idea or something, I need to write down some I want to remember talking about.

51
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,709
I open up like notes and let's go. All right.

52
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,709
It's going to be a stream where I sit on my head and drink a glass of milk. Right.

53
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,949
Whatever. That's not you know what I mean.

54
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:34,939
So I must have opened it and didn't do anything and then just went, oh, I'll get to this later.

55
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:42,379
And then a year plus later, I'm cleaning out these and I didn't remember that's what that did.

56
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,639
I had no idea that's what that did.

57
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,259
You know, like I didn't remember that it fills in placeholder Latin.

58
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,949
So I'm sitting there freaking out thinking, why did why is this here?

59
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,189
Why is this here?

60
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:07,079
Just think about that. If you have if you don't remember that, if you have no idea why that's there, that somebody wrote Latin in your phone.

61
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,579
Who? I didn't fucking do it.

62
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:14,459
You think I don't know Latin? I was going line by line and I was translating it.

63
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,459
And it was just gibberish.

64
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,779
I was like, what what was I trying to even tell myself?

65
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:23,779
Like, what am I doing? Did I do this like as a joke?

66
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:27,779
Like I was showing somebody like, hey, look, look at my notes for a stream I'm thinking of.

67
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,379
It's in Latin. But no.

68
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:42,309
Yeah, it was Lorem Ipsum and it's just the default placeholder for a note take and you just delete it and do your own.

69
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,309
But it was scary. I was actually kind of scared for at least 15 to 20 minutes.

70
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,980
Yeah, it's just placeholder. I know.

71
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,480
But I was putting it into a Latin to English translator and I was getting English words.

72
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,549
I was getting English sentences.

73
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,549
One of them was like, oh, removal of the makeup or something.

74
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,750
And I'm like, removal of the makeup because this is what does that mean?

75
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
What am I? What do you mean removal of makeup?

76
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:17,980
What does that mean?

77
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,350
And I had to forget about it. I had to.

78
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,259
When are you going to do the welding stream?

79
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:27,259
Never. What are you talking about?

80
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:38,700
All right. You guys ready? You guys good to go?

81
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,509
Latin stream incoming.

82
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,509
And there's something about Latin, right?

83
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,509
That's all I'm thinking of this. Hold on.

84
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:52,500
All I'm thinking of is every movie I've ever seen where, you know, the priest is sitting there like,

85
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,500
And I'm just like, oh, my God, I don't know why.

86
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,740
Latin is a scary like demon language in all these fucking movies.

87
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
So I'm sitting there going like, what is this?

88
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:16,529
The only time they use Latin ever in the last like 20 to 30 to 50 plus years is to make it a scary moment in a horror movie.

89
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:22,220
It's nowhere else. Oh, he's speaking Latin.

90
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Oh, shit. The movie just got way scarier, right?

91
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,399
So I'm sitting there thinking like, what the hell?

92
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:37,039
Why is this on here?

93
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,659
You might be the Antichrist.

94
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,460
No, I don't think so.

95
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,730
I think I think I would have figured that out a long time ago.

96
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,730
I don't think Satan makes the Antichrist baby and then waits till he's 37 to like, oh, OK, time to go.

97
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,029
It's the Antichrist. There he is.

98
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:03,460
37 year old fucking comedy dork streamer, German 985.

99
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:11,029
You guys are fucking nuts if you think that. I'm just going to be honest with you. You're crazy.

100
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:20,759
I don't believe that's accurate. All right. Let's go.

101
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:28,700
What do you say? Sim Casino. This has got music, too.

102
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,340
All right. What do you say? I mean, I don't really feel that great.

103
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,379
Maybe no face game for a little while, but I do need to like learn to play.

104
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,059
Now, this is Sim because this is not Casino Inc.

105
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,559
This is Sim Casino. It's a different game.

106
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,700
What I have confirmed and I know people saying, oh, my God, remember Casino Inc.

107
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Where you could like there was like a bunch of crazy shit in that game.

108
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I can confirm that I think that people do beat each other up in this game.

109
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,700
That's all. I didn't look too much into it, but I know that that's a possibility.

110
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,700
So, OK, everybody calm down.

111
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,919
But I kind of want to like make a hotel.

112
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,299
This game is fairly new as well.

113
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,259
This was I think it was an early access or something.

114
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:25,200
It's got a saxophone. All right. Let me learn to play face cam.

115
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:35,889
I'll turn the face cam on in just a minute. Wow.

116
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,580
Damn, that that you can always tell when the person that's playing the saxophone

117
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
knows what they're doing when they do one of those.

118
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,759
They do one of those. It's like that.

119
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,759
You know what I'm talking about?

120
00:12:49,759 --> 00:13:00,580
Did I break it? Sixty. I think I broke that break it.

121
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:09,500
I think I broke it. It doesn't seem like it's functioning.

122
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:22,450
I give it five more seconds.

123
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:30,269
It's crazy because when I do that sound, it sucks and everybody hates it.

124
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,580
But when the saxophone does that sound, everybody loves it, right?

125
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,580
If I do that sound, everyone's going to leave.

126
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
All right. I got to reload the game, I think.

127
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,149
I want to make a casino.

128
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:52,639
Game is like it's messed up.

129
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
I messed it up somehow.

130
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,700
Try again.

131
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,129
Dude, quit. Stop being the Antichrist.

132
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,500
Would that be like public knowledge?

133
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,779
Could I could I could I even still stream?

134
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:15,779
Would it be you know what I mean?

135
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,779
Like, dude, like, of course, like Antichrist Andy like fucked up the game again.

136
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,779
Would that would that be like public knowledge?

137
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:31,600
Andy Christ, please.

138
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,590
OK, can I maybe tutorials?

139
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,500
Maybe because I tried to continue the tutorial.

140
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It screwed up. Oh, OK.

141
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Here we go. No, what?

142
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,860
Oh, no. OK, here we go. All right, let's go.

143
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,039
This is a sim casino.

144
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,399
All right. Welcome to sim casino.

145
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,399
Selected tutorial. All right.

146
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,399
How to control the camera.

147
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,250
This music.

148
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,820
OK, let's see.

149
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
They just take bags of money outside.

150
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,629
OK, let's get a good view of the casino.

151
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,629
Remember that you can change the keyboard shortcuts in the settings screen.

152
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,629
Hover over an objective or additional info.

153
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,190
OK, yeah, that's move, tilt, zoom.

154
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,070
Yeah, easy, easy.

155
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,070
Continue.

156
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,759
All right. Zoom the camera.

157
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,759
Move the camera up and down a level.

158
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:43,379
OK, right bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket.

159
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,379
I just got fucking flashbacks to being invent.

160
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,389
You motherfuckers that used to do that.

161
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:53,230
OK, move the camera up and down.

162
00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:00,269
Right bracket, page up, page up.

163
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,830
Page up.

164
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,330
Right bracket.

165
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,500
I can't take it.

166
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, all right.

167
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's easy.

168
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So this is how you go up and down.

169
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Is that the only way to do it?

170
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,860
Cool.

171
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,429
All right.

172
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,429
Or click on the arrows on the far left of the screen.

173
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,429
Oh, actually, I think I like that better.

174
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:26,700
All right.

175
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,200
Tutorial seems like it's pretty quick.

176
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,200
We should expand our structure's foundations, which creates a base for us to build in.

177
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Hover over the objective for additional help.

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
It's like the wall tool.

179
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,639
OK, look at the left toolbar.

180
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,639
Hover over the buttons.

181
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,639
Find it in the build menu at the bottom of the screen.

182
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,639
All right.

183
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,639
So we need to make a wall tool.

184
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,029
Oh, yeah.

185
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,029
There go walls.

186
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,590
OK.

187
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,590
Add at least 100 10 by 10 new ground floor cells.

188
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,590
All right.

189
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,659
Doesn't matter where.

190
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,460
Right there.

191
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:19,849
It looks kind of awful.

192
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,369
What did I do wrong?

193
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,690
My mic just cut it off.

194
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,990
Like, stop cutting it off.

195
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,990
I'm trying to do it.

196
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,059
Drag to make rooms.

197
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,059
Oh, I'm doing it like the Sims.

198
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,680
OK, that's fine.

199
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,299
OK, cool.

200
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,019
So you can make rooms like this.

201
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,019
OK, pretty sweet.

202
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:56,180
There are two ways to ensure each area is accessible.

203
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Removing an interior wall or adding a door, staff door or private door.

204
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Staff doors are used to secure areas away from the guests, while private doors are used

205
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,180
for dressing rooms and hotel rooms to separate from the other guests.

206
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,349
Make sure all ground level areas are accessible.

207
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:12,779
OK, so we can just.

208
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:13,779
How do we remove?

209
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,289
Google bar or building?

210
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,289
Oh, we can go like this.

211
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,680
Uh, like this.

212
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:35,420
Control Z.

213
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Yeah, this is like a terrible hallway.

214
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Well, I didn't know that was.

215
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
How do I delete this?

216
00:18:42,420 --> 00:19:00,490
Cigarette Andy.

217
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,490
Stop calling me that.

218
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,380
Oh, fuck.

219
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
This is a tutorial.

220
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Who cares?

221
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,380
OK, so how do I make a door?

222
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,809
Fence.

223
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,109
The zone.

224
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,109
Dismantle walls and fences.

225
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,109
Here we go.

226
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,109
OK.

227
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:18,109
Push tab.

228
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:33,130
Remove an interior wall, toolbar or building.

229
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,130
Drag a line across the area to remove it, but it must be all indoors.

230
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,059
Oh, this.

231
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:47,380
What the fuck?

232
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:55,210
Didn't say I can just remove a wall here.

233
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,210
Stop.

234
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,089
Cigarette Andy.

235
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:03,759
I'll just add a door, I guess, then.

236
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,759
Dismantle wall.

237
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,759
D zone.

238
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,759
Fence.

239
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,640
Wall tool.

240
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,329
Operations.

241
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:11,329
I don't understand.

242
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:15,490
Should I build a fucking fence?

243
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,539
I'm not crazy, right?

244
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,539
This is really confusing.

245
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,539
I don't get it.

246
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:26,410
Build menu.

247
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:33,490
Where's the build menu?

248
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,490
This is the build menu here, right?

249
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:43,579
He's too high for this.

250
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,349
Once I figure this out, we're golden.

251
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,349
But what the?

252
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,349
B?

253
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,349
Well, I didn't say B.

254
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,349
How am I supposed to know it's B?

255
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:56,380
How am I supposed to know it's B?

256
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:05,750
OK.

257
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,750
Indoor only.

258
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,819
My god.

259
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,819
If I wasn't just a fucking idiot and didn't build these in the middle of nowhere.

260
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,450
Indoor only?

261
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:29,299
OK, we're just going to delete this because, honestly, god.

262
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,099
What's the delete tool?

263
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,099
Demolish structures.

264
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,099
Just get rid of this.

265
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,609
This needs to be connected to here.

266
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:44,789
It can't be a door leading outside.

267
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:45,789
I have to make a hallway.

268
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,500
OK, so let's make a wall.

269
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,430
Does that work?

270
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,529
This cannot be reached from the bus stop.

271
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:57,529
What do I care?

272
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,240
There we go.

273
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Does this count as a room?

274
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Is this mad that this is not accessible?

275
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:16,369
So what's wrong now?

276
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:32,750
I wouldn't want it needs to be a door.

277
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,750
It's mad that it's not a door.

278
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:45,779
What do you want from me?

279
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:59,349
Why does this count as a room?

280
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,349
All right.

281
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:06,259
I get it.

282
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:11,410
This shouldn't even count as a room.

283
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,410
All right.

284
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,779
So what's going on here is the same company got hired.

285
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:16,779
No, no, no.

286
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:21,900
Two different companies got hired to do the same job and we didn't cancel on one of them

287
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:29,420
and they just malicious compliance came and just installed their doors and we didn't stop

288
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,109
them.

289
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,109
OK, cool.

290
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,109
Zones create rooms with specialized functionality.

291
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:38,609
They can be any shape as long as they meet the minimum requirements.

292
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,910
They look like bright striped cells with text.

293
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,910
Go to the game settings to adjust the transparency and press Z to toggle them off and on.

294
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,839
OK, so this is the garbage zone.

295
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,619
Oh, OK.

296
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:59,619
So this is deliverables, deliveries, garbage, storage, cash vault.

297
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:00,619
Oh, we got a cash.

298
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,619
Why would the cash vault be right here?

299
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,619
It's just going to be underground, man.

300
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:05,619
This is going to be underground.

301
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:08,579
OK, that's cool.

302
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,230
This is gender neutral restroom.

303
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,240
OK, that's all right.

304
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
That's cool.

305
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
OK.

306
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
How many zones can I make and unlimited amount?

307
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Could I have like a thousand cash rooms?

308
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,339
Could I have?

309
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,339
OK.

310
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,779
My plan is to have like 20 cash rooms and I only have one of them have money in them.

311
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,210
You want to come rob my casino?

312
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,210
You better you better get the right one because it's going to be a maze for you.

313
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,069
This music is nice.

314
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:45,190
Yeah, it is.

315
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,819
Hold on.

316
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,819
Let me see.

317
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,059
Because this is to create.

318
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,059
Where was it?

319
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,599
It was here somewhere.

320
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,599
Oh, D zone.

321
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,599
OK.

322
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,029
All right.

323
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,029
Cool.

324
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,359
Let's add a bingo hall.

325
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,359
Well, you know it.

326
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,359
Create a bingo hall.

327
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,859
Find entertainment in the build menu or search for bingo.

328
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:09,349
Drag an area inside the building that meets the minimum required size or shift to quickly

329
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,349
fill the whole room.

330
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,349
Let's go.

331
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,059
Bingo.

332
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:24,779
Bingo.

333
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,779
Wait.

334
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:30,059
Oh, bingo hall zone.

335
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,930
You got it.

336
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,220
Cool.

337
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,220
Check which objects you need by hovering over the zone.

338
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Ah, all right.

339
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
We need this is cool.

340
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
All right.

341
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
We need a bingo podium.

342
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,819
Man, man, can you imagine?

343
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,319
Never mind.

344
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,200
Shh.

345
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Quiet.

346
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,809
Hey, everybody be quiet.

347
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,049
Hey, quiet.

348
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:04,940
Hey, can you imagine if, you know, quiet?

349
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,390
OK.

350
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,220
I gotta be careful here.

351
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
I gotta be careful here.

352
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
I'm getting I'm treading on water.

353
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,390
I shouldn't be.

354
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,390
All right.

355
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,390
I need a bingo podium.

356
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,960
I guess I can just type, right?

357
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Bingo.

358
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,400
Bingo.

359
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Two thousand dollars.

360
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,440
How do you rotate?

361
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Oh, there we are.

362
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,819
Cool.

363
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:53,579
Uh, and then I need bingo seating.

364
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,579
Waiting for a delivery of payout receipt by a workman.

365
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,579
Check you have enough stock assigned.

366
00:26:58,579 --> 00:26:59,579
Wait, what is this?

367
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:08,539
I can't even understand what this is trying to tell me.

368
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,539
What are they?

369
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:16,470
What are they doing here?

370
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:22,960
They didn't even do anything.

371
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Moving crate.

372
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
What did they do?

373
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,119
They didn't do anything.

374
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,769
OK.

375
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:31,769
What else needs to be here?

376
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:41,839
Bingo card counter.

377
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,839
Cool.

378
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,059
All right.

379
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,059
I get it.

380
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,069
I get it.

381
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,069
I get it.

382
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,309
Malicious compliance workers.

383
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,309
All right.

384
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,309
I get it.

385
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,309
That's fun.

386
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,309
You can customize designs and colors of walls with the paint tool.

387
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,309
Hold on.

388
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:57,309
Control it.

389
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,309
Damn.

390
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,559
This soundtrack actually is goes fucking hard.

391
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,559
OK.

392
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,559
With the paint tool.

393
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,559
Hold down and control.

394
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:11,920
All right.

395
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,140
So let's do some painting.

396
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Where's the paint tool?

397
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,150
Paint tool.

398
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,150
You guys see a paint tool?

399
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,029
Somebody else tell me where this other is.

400
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:23,029
OK.

401
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,029
All right.

402
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:25,029
Oh, all right.

403
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,029
I'm into this.

404
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,029
I'm into this a lot.

405
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:28,029
That's fine.

406
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,740
Cool.

407
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
What about the...

408
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Can I do the carpet?

409
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,740
I have to be able to do the carpets, right?

410
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,839
Look at the floors, too.

411
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,839
Oh, to do matching floor.

412
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:51,329
Hold control just like the matching floor.

413
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,329
Matching floor.

414
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,660
How do I do that?

415
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Is there already people playing bingo?

416
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:07,420
How much does this cost?

417
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
OK.

418
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
I want bricks on the ground.

419
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
How do I do that?

420
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,960
Hold shift.

421
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Hold control.

422
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,380
I don't get it.

423
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Hold control.

424
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,130
Oh, come on.

425
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,130
That was...

426
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,130
I half-assed.

427
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,130
That one's so bad.

428
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,130
Oh, come on, Gun.

429
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,130
I don't even care anymore.

430
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,140
OK, there we go.

431
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:42,170
I love that phrase, but I really didn't give it any effort at all.

432
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,170
OK.

433
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,170
Move a single object or...

434
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,170
Yep, yep, yep.

435
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:52,750
Move a single object or drag multi-selected and move multiple objects.

436
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,630
Oh, shit.

437
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,630
OK.

438
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,970
Move.

439
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,970
Oh, that's actually pretty.

440
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,970
That's useful.

441
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,980
That's useful.

442
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,049
Copy an object with the eyedropper.

443
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,500
Sick.

444
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Yep.

445
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:19,420
Clone an area with the clone tool and you can clone the whole thing.

446
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Whoa.

447
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,069
All right.

448
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,170
That's very helpful.

449
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,170
Finally, you can click copy on any designer tool and click paste on another object designer tool.

450
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:37,339
You can also copy certain settings and use multi-selected many objects.

451
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,339
Stop doing that.

452
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,339
I'm going to give myself another headache and paste the settings multi-selected.

453
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,339
I don't think I need to do that.

454
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:43,339
My brain is too small for that.

455
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,339
I don't care.

456
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,500
All right.

457
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
A successful casino.

458
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,680
Do we know?

459
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I think we pretty much know what we're doing.

460
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm going to go through this pretty quickly.

461
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Wait.

462
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Delete.

463
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,079
Slime machines are fundamentally a success.

464
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,079
Some have been built already.

465
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,079
If you haven't destroyed them, of course, you can change the game type, which affects its stats.

466
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,079
Ooh.

467
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:16,619
Play.

468
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:17,619
It's a dollar to play it.

469
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:18,619
OK.

470
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,619
Jackpot chance is five percent.

471
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,619
Jackpot is ten dollars.

472
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:24,619
What a terrible jackpot.

473
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,619
This needs to be fucking like a fucking million.

474
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,619
House advantage.

475
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,619
I don't know.

476
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:30,619
Five.

477
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:34,930
OK.

478
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:41,670
OK.

479
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,670
Slime machines are fundamental.

480
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,670
OK.

481
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,670
Click on a slot machine and switch to game settings and tap.

482
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,670
Yeah.

483
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,829
OK.

484
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:50,829
Cool.

485
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:51,829
Gamblers have a confidence score.

486
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:57,829
New gamblers generally enter with a low confidence score, and this is increased when they win or push in games.

487
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,829
The higher the pay play cost, the more confidence they need to try it.

488
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:04,829
To avoid alienating new players, it's good to have a variety of play costs.

489
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,579
Increase the play cost to one dollar.

490
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,579
Note the confidence value.

491
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:12,099
OK.

492
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,099
Zero to two point four.

493
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,099
So what if I made this like ten bucks?

494
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:19,710
OK.

495
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,150
This OST is Jerry Martin.

496
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,150
It's the original composer of Sims 1.

497
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,150
Is that legitimate?

498
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,150
Are you for real?

499
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,029
Because that's pretty fucking cool if you're accurate.

500
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,980
All right.

501
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
House advantage has got to be more than that, but whatever.

502
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,980
We're just doing the tutorial.

503
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,519
House advantage is how we make a profit.

504
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,519
Imagine a coin toss where you pay one dollar with a 50 percent chance of winning back two dollars.

505
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,519
On average, you would break even, and the edge is zero percent.

506
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:56,519
Charge commission on those winnings will replace it with a biased coin that lands on our side more frequently, and we would have an advantage.

507
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,819
Remember that if players lose too often, they will get frustrated.

508
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:00,819
OK.

509
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:04,470
Copy these settings to at least four other slots.

510
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,470
How do I do that?

511
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:10,619
Copy game settings to bingo.

512
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,619
Copy.

513
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,539
But how do I do that?

514
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,190
Oh, got it.

515
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,190
Paste game settings.

516
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,970
What the hell?

517
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,819
What the hell?

518
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:35,349
What the hell?

519
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:42,859
Copy game settings.

520
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:46,279
How do I paste?

521
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:52,619
Paste game settings, right?

522
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:58,460
What the hell?

523
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:09,639
Control C, control V, control C.

524
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,940
Oh, that's not how you do it.

525
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I mean, I'm very clearly doing it.

526
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,809
Ten bucks.

527
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:20,070
Jackpot.

528
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,070
Thousand.

529
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,699
House advantage.

530
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,699
Ten percent, right?

531
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,699
Like, OK, copy settings and paste it to everything.

532
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,739
That had to have done it.

533
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:37,619
What?

534
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:43,130
He's never used the keyboard.

535
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,219
Um, hundred dollars.

536
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,170
Player cost.

537
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,170
One dollar.

538
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,730
Oh, OK.

539
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,730
And whatever.

540
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,099
That had to be the exact thing.

541
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,099
I just whatever.

542
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,099
I get it.

543
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,659
I get it.

544
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:00,659
I get it.

545
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:01,659
Payout receipt by a workman.

546
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:03,659
And when a gambler wins, the machine will print out a payout receipt.

547
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:07,659
The gambler will take this to the ATM to collect their cash as long as they don't forget.

548
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:12,659
Thought machines have electricity costs and require a higher confidence to play for low play cost amounts at first.

549
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:15,659
You can research high limit gambling and higher advantages.

550
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:16,659
All right.

551
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:19,409
Table games have a higher betting amounts.

552
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,409
I know what a casino is.

553
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:22,409
All right.

554
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:24,929
Let's build a cashier.

555
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:37,780
Cashier cage.

556
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,780
Build a table game.

557
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,429
A gambling tab.

558
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:45,429
OK.

559
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:49,250
How about a Texas Hold'em?

560
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,900
I don't know how to play this.

561
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
I don't like playing this.

562
00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:01,489
Zone and build a pit boss office.

563
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:03,940
OK.

564
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:16,869
Pit boss office.

565
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,530
OK.

566
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,960
Failed.

567
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Oh, OK.

568
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Hold on.

569
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,579
We need a door.

570
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:35,670
OK.

571
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,679
We need a computer desk.

572
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,679
Requires to be protected behind a staff door.

573
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,679
Oh, whatever.

574
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:47,949
And now we need a computer desk.

575
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:51,539
Listen to the sounds.

576
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,590
OK.

577
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,179
Cool.

578
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,179
This is crazy.

579
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:07,860
A player's club desk will allow you to track info about your gamblers if they sign up.

580
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,860
Encourage them to sign up with a complimentary gift.

581
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Once signed up, they can come back as repeat customers and retain their confidence level

582
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
for next time.

583
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,219
Nice.

584
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:18,219
All right.

585
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,219
Managing staff and crime.

586
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:20,980
Your staff handle the...

587
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
All right.

588
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
This music's too good for me to talk.

589
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:35,460
You're...

590
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,980
Jesus.

591
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,420
Are you done?

592
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,389
Have you finished?

593
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:49,389
OK.

594
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,760
We need to clap, I think.

595
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I feel like everyone needs to clap because we've got to kind of get back to what we were

596
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
doing.

597
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Your staff handle the operations of your casino.

598
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,760
They work at desks or drinks, watch for criminals, and drain your bank balance with their wages.

599
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,059
That's an odd way to word that last sentence.

600
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,059
OK.

601
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,059
There are a lot more...

602
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,059
If there are...

603
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,059
If there are...

604
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,059
I'm just...

605
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,519
I'm thinking the solo's going to come back and it's freaking me out.

606
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,519
There are a lot more tasks than staff.

607
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
A warning will show.

608
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,019
You should schedule more if the warning stays on for a long time.

609
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,019
Note that staff are automatically hired when scheduled.

610
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:29,019
There's no need to hire or fire staff.

611
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,019
You'll always have the right amount for your schedules.

612
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,019
OK.

613
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,019
That's kind of helpful.

614
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,920
All right.

615
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Let's do it.

616
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Let's take a look at the staff management screen.

617
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,920
On the right of it, let's see how many are a busy or idle on patrol.

618
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,920
As our casino gets bigger, we will likely need more...

619
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Canada.

620
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,349
Add a garbage zone if you...

621
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,349
Fuck!

622
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,789
That was so bad.

623
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:03,260
I was trying to do, like, to the music.

624
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
You know what?

625
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I could have done it, but when stuff doesn't rhyme...

626
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
It feels weird to sing it.

627
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,329
You know what I'm saying?

628
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:16,329
You know, if something rhymes, it's like a song.

629
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:20,329
The last word usually rhymes, but I can't do it right here.

630
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,329
Do it again?

631
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,329
I'll try it again.

632
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:27,820
But it has to be in, like, a poem format.

633
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,559
OK.

634
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,559
Oh, this is embarrassing.

635
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,559
And that's why I'm at...

636
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,559
You're making me do this because it's embarrassing.

637
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,559
OK.

638
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,559
Press unassigned key.

639
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,559
Or find the button on the bottom menu bar.

640
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,559
Stack of operations menu.

641
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,809
OK.

642
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,860
The staff type is automatically hired.

643
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Click on their placed object or zones to edit.

644
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
OK.

645
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Garbage.

646
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,829
Scheduled hours.

647
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,840
All right.

648
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
So we have...

649
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., there are two...

650
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
There are two janitors?

651
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,530
Add schedule.

652
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,530
All right.

653
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,690
All right.

654
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,690
This is pretty...

655
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,139
I get it.

656
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:25,500
What about the housekeeping schedule screen?

657
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Housekeeping...

658
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,869
Where is that?

659
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:33,139
Oh, OK.

660
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,139
This is it right there.

661
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,139
All right.

662
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,110
Cool.

663
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,110
Look at when the janitors will arrive during the weekend and the weekends.

664
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,110
By default, weekdays and weekends use the same schedule.

665
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,110
Does it help?

666
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,110
I guess number three.

667
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,019
OK.

668
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:49,960
Easy.

669
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
You do not need to hire these new janitors.

670
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,960
They are hired automatically when you schedule extra workmen, guards, and chefs.

671
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
There are chefs in the game, by the way.

672
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Everybody relax.

673
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:06,900
Setting up your staffed objects like cashier cages, bars, and desks is simpler.

674
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Schedule editor is basically the same, but you toggle the open close hours instead of

675
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
the number of staff.

676
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
They're also hired automatically.

677
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,389
OK.

678
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,139
I'll figure this out later.

679
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,139
You can set patrols up.

680
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,320
OK.

681
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,389
I'll figure this out later.

682
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,389
All right.

683
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:24,099
I'll figure this out later.

684
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,099
I'll figure this out later.

685
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:26,099
All right.

686
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:32,710
We can do area patrols or the security guard over the front door.

687
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:39,460
All right.

688
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
This makes sense, doesn't it?

689
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
That makes sense, right?

690
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
OK.

691
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,980
That's good.

692
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
That's good.

693
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,440
That looks good.

694
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
That looks good.

695
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,460
Oh, it's like drink servers.

696
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,210
Oh, OK.

697
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,699
So we can make them go like this, right?

698
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:06,699
Because they're going to start here at the bar and they're going to go, yoink, and then

699
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,219
they're going to go like this.

700
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:13,059
This is going to walk around.

701
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:15,699
This thing.

702
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,699
At least four points.

703
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:22,030
Oh, come on.

704
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,030
And then back over.

705
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,030
I don't know.

706
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,030
Over here to this table.

707
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,110
Yeah.

708
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,110
All right.

709
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:42,079
Looks good.

710
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,880
Free the person in the bathroom?

711
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
What do you mean?

712
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,909
Hungry, thirsty, bored.

713
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:50,909
Wait.

714
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:51,909
I am this person now?

715
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:58,019
You can run?

716
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:02,260
All right.

717
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,260
This is inverted mouse controls, by the way.

718
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:13,800
That's kind of funny.

719
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,789
OK.

720
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:18,789
OK.

721
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:21,789
Pit Bosses can be set on patrol to calm the frustrated players of slot machines and table

722
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:22,789
games.

723
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:24,789
They also look out for hackers and cheaters near them.

724
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:26,289
Security guards are a lot different.

725
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:30,289
They look out for thieves, hackers, and cheaters, and can chase them, too.

726
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:34,289
You'll want them spread around your casino so they will be standing in ideal locations

727
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:36,289
to capture criminals.

728
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:44,559
When you look at the recent crimes and the local crime rate, suburbs tend to have much

729
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,559
less crimes in the big city.

730
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,949
Oh, open the crimes overview screen.

731
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:54,150
What are all these people doing out here?

732
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,480
All right.

733
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
The crimes overview.

734
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,980
Woody Lane neighborhood crime five percent.

735
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,780
How many guards should chase down a single criminal?

736
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Eight?

737
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:16,699
No.

738
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:17,699
That would be crazy.

739
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,500
One is fine.

740
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,500
The three main crime types are slot machine hackers, stalk thieves, and table game cheaters.

741
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,670
Thieves can hack your staff doors to access restricted places.

742
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,849
Cheaters take longer to detect and may win multiple times before getting noticed.

743
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:38,150
There's a good chance they will fail to cheat and end up losing more money than they started

744
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,150
with.

745
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,150
These failed attempts do not show up in the crime report.

746
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,250
Research security cameras, detect criminals.

747
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,940
Okay.

748
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
All right.

749
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,239
All right.

750
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,219
We are almost done.

751
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,349
We're almost done.

752
00:44:58,349 --> 00:44:59,349
Free the lady.

753
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:00,349
What are you?

754
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:01,349
I don't have...

755
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:12,900
It's a tutorial.

756
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,780
I don't know what it said.

757
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,780
These are your recent thoughts.

758
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,659
I lost at the slot machine.

759
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:23,659
There were no nearby bin.

760
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:33,369
Not the fact that you've been trapped in the bathroom for like 12 hours.

761
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:35,369
Oh, it actually said the bar.

762
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:45,909
Can I play a machine?

763
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:50,030
Okay.

764
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,030
Open the...

765
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,659
What was it?

766
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:53,659
Manually delivery is enabled.

767
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:56,659
This means we need to set how much stock to order.

768
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:59,659
On the left is a graph showing current zone capacities.

769
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:03,920
And in the middle is all the stock types.

770
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,889
At the bottom of the screen, click on the truck.

771
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:19,960
Bedsheets, beer, betting tickets, table game chips, and soda.

772
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Okay.

773
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,800
Set the target of payout receipts to at least six.

774
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,510
Payout receipts.

775
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,260
Six.

776
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,260
Six.

777
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,659
Okay.

778
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:36,239
Cool.

779
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,239
Let's say you have two crates of payout receipts in storage and a target of six.

780
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,239
In the next delivery, you would expect to see four additional crates.

781
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,239
If you ever have too much of something because of a higher target than the number of crates,

782
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,239
the excess will stay in your inventory.

783
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,739
You can click on crates to sell them.

784
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:53,739
Okay.

785
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:58,750
How long has he been streaming for?

786
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,750
I don't know, like 40 minutes.

787
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,750
I'm just chilling today.

788
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,750
Yeah, all right.

789
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,750
So now that there's enough people here...

790
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,750
Let me go over this one more time.

791
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,750
My green screen got moved to a different day because I didn't really feel that well.

792
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:16,750
And I don't want to make my headache worse by laughing every 15 seconds as hard as I

793
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,750
can, especially considering that there's a lot of shit going on this coming week.

794
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,750
And then baseball.

795
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,750
So don't worry.

796
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,750
We're still doing it.

797
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,750
We're still doing it.

798
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,750
I'm just moving it to like another, I don't know, maybe four, three or four days, maybe

799
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,750
next weekend.

800
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,750
Maybe...

801
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,179
I'll figure it out.

802
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:34,179
Don't worry.

803
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:35,179
We are going to do it.

804
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:36,179
Don't ask me.

805
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:37,179
It's...

806
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:38,179
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.

807
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:39,489
I'm not going to just skip it.

808
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,820
Okay.

809
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,630
But anyways.

810
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,630
All right.

811
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,190
Transport tab.

812
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,190
Supply truck comes...

813
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,190
All right.

814
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,190
So you can determine how often this shit comes.

815
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,199
All right.

816
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:52,199
I get it.

817
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:54,019
Most important stock is cash.

818
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:57,699
ATMs and cashier cages get filled regularly because they need to hand out cash when gamblers

819
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,260
win.

820
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,800
What if I don't have any cash?

821
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Don't worry, guys.

822
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,719
He'll watch more videos and play Yakuza Zero and finish Red Dead 2.

823
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,019
All right.

824
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:13,219
But you can't take something from like four and a half years ago and say, hey, man, remember

825
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:19,230
when you didn't finish Red Dead 2 five years ago or whatever it was?

826
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,230
No.

827
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,230
You...

828
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,230
This is how it works.

829
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:26,110
You get to have a trailing six months of things to be upset about me with.

830
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,349
Right?

831
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:28,349
It's a trailing six months.

832
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:32,550
If it's been a year, I mean, come on.

833
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,989
I didn't play Yakuza Zero.

834
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:34,989
It's been a year.

835
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:36,030
It's been like two years.

836
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,110
You can't...

837
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,070
It's trailing six months.

838
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,070
Where's Paper Mario?

839
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,070
All right.

840
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,269
So that one, I understand.

841
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:46,989
I understand that one because I said, you know, within it, remember the trailing six

842
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:54,630
months that I would play it.

843
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,630
What about Sly Cooper?

844
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,750
I don't want to play.

845
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,119
I don't want to play Sly Cooper.

846
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,440
Here's why I don't want to play Sly Cooper.

847
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to open the game and I'm going to do the first two levels and go, I don't really

848
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,559
care.

849
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,639
And I'm going to sit there and go, I remember this game was really fun.

850
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,840
This is like a really cool game back in like the fucking seventies when it came out and

851
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,840
it's cool.

852
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,039
But I'm going to get through the first three levels and go, all right.

853
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,480
That was some nostalgia.

854
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,300
That was fun.

855
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,860
And when I played Ratatouille, everyone was so excited for it.

856
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:31,650
And I played for three hours and I said, why this is OK, that was fun.

857
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,650
Sly Cooper is a great game.

858
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,650
It is.

859
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,090
I remember playing it when I was younger, but I would probably on stream, I'd probably

860
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,090
be like, all right, let's go.

861
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,170
And then I would get like through like an hour and a half in and be like, oh shit, I

862
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,170
got to shit.

863
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,170
I've got to take a shit.

864
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,170
I've got to leave guys.

865
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,170
I got to take a shit.

866
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,170
I would take a big poop.

867
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:55,860
And I would leave and then I would go to Holly after and go, man, that game, that game was

868
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
as bad as I remember.

869
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,340
Was it as bad as I remember?

870
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,340
I thought it was good.

871
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:16,139
And I'll just rant for like an hour and 25 minutes.

872
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,219
It's a totally completely fabricated scenario.

873
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,099
All right.

874
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,099
Stop.

875
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,099
I have to get to that of the tutorial so I can play.

876
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:26,489
All right.

877
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,489
Let's open.

878
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:28,489
Let's open the cash screen.

879
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:34,139
OK.

880
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:41,030
So this is how much cash like this is my cash management.

881
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:48,500
Lower the rate guards empty machines to less than 30 percent.

882
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Now why is that?

883
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:53,420
The guards should attempt to empty objects holding cash when they have this full.

884
00:50:53,420 --> 00:51:01,210
I get this 2500 bucks in machines and this 2500 bucks in the casino.

885
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,210
Cash in the bank.

886
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,210
Seven hundred eighty five thousand.

887
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,460
You are a background character in Friends.

888
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:15,780
Are you saying that because I'm one of the people that just says nonsense and moves their

889
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:24,940
mouth talking with a drink in their hand while like they do the scene in front of us?

890
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:30,099
What you're describing is I'm the person that I have that exact same conversation with one

891
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:35,900
of the other extras and it looks like I'm really talking and moving my hands.

892
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,579
But I said almost nothing.

893
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:40,219
That was I said almost nothing.

894
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:41,900
Is that what you meant by that statement?

895
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,019
No, you bet your ass.

896
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,139
You bet your ass I would look directly in the camera.

897
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:55,820
If I was ever in if I was ever in like a background actor in one of these shows, the camera's

898
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,079
going to go by and look directly in the lens and they're going to edit it and they're going

899
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,880
to be like, what the fuck, dude?

900
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,440
This guy looked right into the lens.

901
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,480
He looked right into the camera.

902
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,070
Why?

903
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:20,659
The one thing they teach you in like acting school is the camera does not exist.

904
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:25,659
And any time you like look into the lens, it's like it's like playing operation.

905
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:27,699
It's like, nope, wrong, wrong.

906
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:33,900
All right, let's go.

907
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Let's go.

908
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
We got it.

909
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
We're done.

910
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,750
I'm ready.

911
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:47,099
It's time to make our casino.

912
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,099
All right.

913
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,420
New.

914
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,110
Here we go.

915
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,590
Instant research, auto delivery, instant staff.

916
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,590
That's fine.

917
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,090
Watch.

918
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,460
How much money should I start with?

919
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:17,349
I'm going to say I'm going to say clean, cool, one million, clean, cool, one million.

920
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,619
So cool.

921
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:23,119
Is Mr. Green's back?

922
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,139
Well, well, stop talking.

923
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,139
Stop talking.

924
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,829
You're gonna get me in trouble.

925
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:31,829
All right.

926
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:33,469
How about just me?

927
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:37,329
All right.

928
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:38,329
Pre-built starter map.

929
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:49,909
No, I want to make my own.

930
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:52,400
We know you don't know.

931
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,940
You don't have any idea.

932
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,369
All right.

933
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:56,369
So this is where we're going to go.

934
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:57,550
132,000.

935
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,550
What's going on?

936
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:06,329
Is the fucking meteor hitting?

937
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:07,329
Oh, OK.

938
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,329
Why is it getting so dark?

939
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,280
Why did we hit the shadow?

940
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,280
What is this?

941
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Oh, it's over here.

942
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,280
Oh, I like this.

943
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,400
279,000.

944
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,980
Isn't this a hotel?

945
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,980
All right.

946
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,980
So I make a hotel.

947
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,280
OK.

948
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm going to buy these both.

949
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:34,420
This is going to be the hotel and this is going to be the casino.

950
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,420
All right.

951
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,420
Let's start here and go.

952
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,420
279,000.

953
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,420
You have no parking.

954
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,420
All right.

955
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,420
Here's what I want to do.

956
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,789
I want to have.

957
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:42,789
All right.

958
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:43,789
What is this music?

959
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:44,789
This is nice.

960
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:54,599
OK.

961
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,929
Look at this area we got to work with.

962
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:57,929
All right.

963
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,679
This is this is huge.

964
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:01,440
Oh, my goodness.

965
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,610
This is way too much.

966
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,389
This is too big.

967
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,329
This is too big.

968
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:08,329
This is too big.

969
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:09,329
This is too big.

970
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:10,329
This is too big.

971
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:11,329
This is too big.

972
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:12,329
Oh, my goodness.

973
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:14,599
This is way too much.

974
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:15,599
This is too big.

975
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,239
Uh, OK.

976
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:31,650
Um, let's just make a I'm going to have this is the big lobby, right?

977
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,849
Lobby is going to go off to the hotel.

978
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:43,739
So let's do here is this just opener that is huge is going to be a big lobby and then

979
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,219
leading over this way is the hotels.

980
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:48,469
So it's going to go yoink.

981
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:58,239
You need to start a war with pasta Italiano fucking crazy.

982
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:05,320
I wish they would remake that game, dude.

983
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:11,519
For those of you that new viewers that don't know what that is, Casino Inc is one of the

984
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:18,110
most outrageous video games I think it's ever been made, that it's I can't even explain

985
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,110
it.

986
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,110
Just you need to go.

987
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,110
You need to go watch the VOD.

988
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,110
That's all I can tell.

989
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:25,989
I'll go download it and play it on your own and just spoiler free and be like, holy shit.

990
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,610
What the hell were they doing?

991
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,110
It's like almost a perfect video game.

992
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,369
All right.

993
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:32,369
So let's go over this way.

994
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:47,039
This is going to be the hallway leading to the hotel.

995
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,280
And this would be a these would be a bunch of rooms here.

996
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,949
So this is like, all right, is the hallway then?

997
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,559
And I just wait, I just do a big.

998
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,719
Can I separate the rooms like, wait, hold on.

999
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,690
Oh, I can do that.

1000
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,019
All right. Let me do that.

1001
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,340
Never mind. I like that's going to be the table games room.

1002
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:39,960
This will be the hallway to the hotel alone.

1003
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,280
Delete this. If my how much do I get my money back if I delete stuff?

1004
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,800
I don't get my money back if I don't if I do this.

1005
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,800
How come I don't get my money back?

1006
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:23,519
Wait, actually, I just let's have like a staff room right here.

1007
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:31,739
We're going to find your casino and playthrough.

1008
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:36,969
Um, it's just be on YouTube on the Archive Channel.

1009
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,769
OK, I need to figure this out.

1010
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:41,969
This is way too big.

1011
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:45,449
So this would be like a casino floor.

1012
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:50,469
We add a wall here. Hold on.

1013
00:58:50,469 --> 00:58:52,789
Yeah, like this, I like a bathroom here, right?

1014
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's bathroom.

1015
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,829
What else is in a casino?

1016
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:07,510
Is casino ink a good purchase?

1017
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,670
You know, I don't know how well it runs on Windows 11

1018
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,269
or 10 or anything, right?

1019
00:59:13,269 --> 00:59:15,469
Because I played it, what, three, two, three years ago.

1020
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:18,920
Was even on Windows 10 two, three years ago.

1021
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,719
I don't know. Does it still run?

1022
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:29,340
OK, so that looks good.

1023
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,969
I need to get rid of this because this is going to be slots.

1024
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,949
This would be table games and this is going to be the hotel.

1025
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:47,170
Jesus. All right.

1026
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:58,840
Hotel. This hotel is right here and it's going to be sick.

1027
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:11,190
Build. OK, here we go.

1028
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,269
All right. To me, this is a trap.

1029
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:28,800
Right. This feels like I'm going to walk in here

1030
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,039
and it's going to the room's going to like spikes.

1031
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:37,150
They're going to shoot out. Hold on.

1032
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:41,119
Can I put this higher?

1033
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,440
I don't know. Why is the ceiling so low?

1034
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,269
I don't get it. I don't care. Whatever.

1035
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:58,409
I need outdoor paint. I need an ATM.

1036
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:01,630
All right. All right. Hold on.

1037
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:08,880
You only have one floor.

1038
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:17,440
This is some Hey Arnold shit. That's what I'm saying.

1039
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:25,389
OK, I needed first of all, I need front door door

1040
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:30,210
commercial double door.

1041
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:35,840
You know, it's been one of these.

1042
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,320
Oh, wait, this is this with a garbage.

1043
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:41,159
I can't have the front door be where the trash gets taken out.

1044
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:06,760
I feel like I'm making this in Roblox.

1045
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,599
OK, that's fine for now.

1046
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:15,980
Wait, I want this to be different.

1047
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,119
Don't people make full video games in Roblox

1048
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,920
that you can't even tell the difference?

1049
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,639
You can't tell that it was made in Roblox

1050
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:29,760
because every pixel has been changed to every single

1051
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,559
every ounce of paint.

1052
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:37,570
That's crazy.

1053
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,570
That's ridiculous.

1054
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:42,280
Something about that is really cool.

1055
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,320
OK, so what's this?

1056
01:02:44,320 --> 01:03:02,690
Oh, that's better.

1057
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:18,780
And they even get through that. No, delete that.

1058
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,940
How do I get this looks stupid with the grass.

1059
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:33,869
I need like a new floor.

1060
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:41,579
Um, excuse me.

1061
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,099
OK, floor terrain. There we go.

1062
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,320
Oh, here you're going to get the red carpet experience.

1063
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:21,829
Yeah, that's fine.

1064
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:24,099
What are you talking about?

1065
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:41,800
It's been indoor floor. Why? OK, well, that's annoying.

1066
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,460
This is this saxophone.

1067
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,940
I don't care. That's fine.

1068
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:59,760
All right, let's do, um, combinations.

1069
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,360
This is OK, hotel.

1070
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:06,800
So this is I got to put a sign here, right?

1071
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:15,039
Desk to sell rooms to you. Oh, here we go.

1072
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,389
Wait, why is it like a Wizard of Oz door?

1073
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,380
Hold on, move this.

1074
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,579
I don't understand. Why is it like this?

1075
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:41,280
All right, door and an interior door.

1076
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:46,599
Holy shit. All right.

1077
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:52,239
I need a bathroom to the indoor door.

1078
01:05:52,920 --> 01:06:01,440
Hotel room zone. OK, this is the hotels.

1079
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,159
I need to move this a little bit.

1080
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:13,840
Now, because this is where somebody at the window takes the they pay.

1081
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,070
There's a washing machine.

1082
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,789
All right. I need a door, just a door door.

1083
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:30,110
Commercial single door there. All right.

1084
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,000
This is not a single hotel room, right?

1085
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,719
This room or one of the sub rooms should contain a bed.

1086
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,840
This is a that's a no, it's not.

1087
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,920
Well, whatever, we make it fucking ten grand a week to rent it out.

1088
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,940
No, it's not. I can make a little sub rooms, it said.

1089
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,800
All right, so I need a I need a staff.

1090
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,639
This hotel requires a laundry zone.

1091
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,380
No, it doesn't.

1092
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,659
The hotel requires a laundry since when?

1093
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,639
OK, well, laundry make the laundry zone.

1094
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:22,019
We'll make that like over here.

1095
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:40,440
Yeah, that's perfect over here.

1096
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,920
OK, this is laundry.

1097
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:54,210
Laundry can be reached from the bus stop.

1098
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,760
Why do I care that it can?

1099
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,599
I don't care.

1100
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,320
Oh, it's just that it has to go door to door door door door.

1101
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,960
I get you. OK, I understand.

1102
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,280
All right. That's the laundry room.

1103
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,239
Let me do this later.

1104
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:08,800
Let's get the fucking casino games.

1105
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,880
How much money do I have? I got money.

1106
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,560
OK, laundry washing machine.

1107
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:31,840
How many should I do like two or three?

1108
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,600
OK, and then what else does this need?

1109
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,390
Requires to be protected behind a staff door.

1110
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:46,380
You got it. OK.

1111
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:52,840
Add storage shelves to increase the capacity.

1112
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,710
Easy. Wait, this side probably.

1113
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:06,840
Yeah, we're here. Look at that.

1114
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,199
And we'll put we'll put we'll put a painting.

1115
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:11,539
All right. Cool.

1116
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:17,100
Our laundry room is here.

1117
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:25,430
How much does it cost to use the laundry room?

1118
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:31,300
How much does this cost to use the laundry room?

1119
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,779
Make the wallpaper very loud.

1120
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,840
I will in a minute.

1121
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,119
OK, first of all, we need to figure this out because this is messed up.

1122
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,800
Yeah, this is all messed up.

1123
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,119
I got to fix this immediately.

1124
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,399
It's not what I wanted to do.

1125
01:09:53,399 --> 01:10:01,500
But god damn it, whatever.

1126
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:11,380
How do I just I want to get rid of the wall?

1127
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:19,340
How do I get rid of the wall?

1128
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,579
I just want to get rid of the wall.

1129
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:27,260
There we go. There we go.

1130
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,430
Yeah, I don't I don't want a door.

1131
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:34,069
When you move around a casino floor, you don't open up doors

1132
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:41,579
to go to the next area. You just walk.

1133
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:44,850
There's not a single steam room door.

1134
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:54,640
No, it's just open.

1135
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,800
But it has to be this because we have to pay to get in here.

1136
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:02,829
Why is there no face cam?

1137
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:08,180
Yeah, I don't really feel that well today.

1138
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,619
I've been like really fucking sloppy recently.

1139
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:13,819
That's another reason why the green screen is not tonight.

1140
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:15,140
But I still wanted to stream.

1141
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:20,579
I didn't want to just not stream because I want to stream.

1142
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:24,750
It's fun. I enjoy it.

1143
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,789
But we'll do it again.

1144
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:27,430
We it's ready to go.

1145
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:32,069
The playlist, I think, has our two playlist, I think, hundred and twenty videos.

1146
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:36,500
So there's a lot to watch.

1147
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:41,289
I just didn't want to start laughing and just pop a blow a gasket in my brain

1148
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,729
and get a migraine, have to turn the stream off in half an hour.

1149
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:50,770
You know what I mean? I'd rather just save it, especially considering

1150
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:54,170
I need I want to be ready for baseball in like a week and a half.

1151
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:56,319
So I just I got to be careful.

1152
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,399
I don't want to mess anything up before doing the baseball stream.

1153
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:06,989
All right. But anyway, let's go.

1154
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,029
Oh, you.

1155
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,439
What do I want to do?

1156
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:30,609
What are you doing flying a spaceship?

1157
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:32,810
You didn't know what that was.

1158
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:37,560
Find that person out.

1159
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,079
OK, let's I don't get overwhelmed by the blueprint.

1160
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:49,319
Okay, let's, um...

1161
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:52,010
I'm gonna do tables first. Table games.

1162
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:56,239
Or should I do decorations first?

1163
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:05,439
Yes. That's what we're doing.

1164
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:11,710
Okay, floor. Carpet. Oh, there we go.

1165
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:14,189
Alright, I want...

1166
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:17,189
Ooh, that's cool looking, but I can't undo it, so I need to make sure I like it.

1167
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:18,560
This is cool.

1168
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,010
Dude, casino floors all have

1169
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:25,000
this wild,

1170
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
actually cool grandma carpet.

1171
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,210
It's like if grandma

1172
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:34,329
wore a hat backwards, and

1173
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:36,510
like, rode a skateboard. That's the kind

1174
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,510
of carpet that's in every casino.

1175
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:45,399
Yuck. I like that.

1176
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:51,739
Hold on. I'm not picking it yet.

1177
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:55,880
That hurts my head. These are all just

1178
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:01,369
magic eyes. Oh!

1179
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:08,779
Oh! Oh! Yeah,

1180
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:16,010
look at that. I don't want it to be the entire casino.

1181
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:22,159
That's a bowling alley? Yeah, bowling

1182
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,159
alleys and casinos are very similar.

1183
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,119
That's true. Why

1184
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:32,090
is that? You know, I think it's like the same

1185
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,090
mindset of casino

1186
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:38,250
design and bowling alley design. That's

1187
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:45,609
true. And bus seats.

1188
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:55,640
Yeah. Oh, I know. I know.

1189
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,010
I hide the puke. Right?

1190
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:02,670
Yeah. It makes

1191
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,670
sure that it hides all the puke. If you

1192
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,670
puke on this carpet,

1193
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:13,960
no one's ever going to know. That's

1194
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,960
a good... That's true. You're right.

1195
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,229
Should it be that the whole way? No.

1196
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:23,710
This one's kind of boring.

1197
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:38,350
I like the blue.

1198
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:42,760
The first one?

1199
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,960
Wow. That could be in a different

1200
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,130
room. Could that be the hotel room floor?

1201
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:58,430
Oh, wood.

1202
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:02,890
What about this wood? That looks all right.

1203
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Wait, what?

1204
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,270
What?

1205
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:25,659
How much is this?

1206
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:34,880
$28,000. That's it?

1207
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,880
That's so stupid. All right. I gotta

1208
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,880
make a decision here. This is

1209
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,439
indecisive. This is fine.

1210
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:54,840
No, that's ugly. I like this

1211
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:16,909
one. Yeah, this one's good.

1212
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:19,210
Laser tag. Yeah, I mean,

1213
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,210
it's starting to kind of look like a Nickelodeon

1214
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:26,270
TV set. That's fine, though.

1215
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:36,779
This has to go all the way to the wall.

1216
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:38,779
This looks fucking ugly. Get it right.

1217
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,779
Get it right or don't stream.

1218
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:43,529
You know what I mean? Get it right or turn

1219
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:46,859
off the stream.

1220
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:48,859
Okay, walls.

1221
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:51,680
How about just bricks?

1222
01:17:51,680 --> 01:18:03,710
I need an exterior.

1223
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:19,630
Ooh, I kind of like that.

1224
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:30,359
I like this.

1225
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:32,359
It's so bad. Why? I like...

1226
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:34,359
It looks fine. It looks cool.

1227
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:48,939
What's the problem with that?

1228
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:50,939
If my grandma had a mansion, it would look like this.

1229
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:54,329
Yeah, and your grandma would be having the

1230
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:59,840
time of her life there.

1231
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,239
Let's continue.

1232
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,119
We haven't even put the games in yet.

1233
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,890
I need interior paint.

1234
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:25,359
Wallpaper.

1235
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:27,359
Patrons are complaining of headaches every time

1236
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:32,729
they come to the casino.

1237
01:19:32,729 --> 01:19:35,229
Themed walls?

1238
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:40,350
I mean, now it's a casino.

1239
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:48,279
Every casino has to be

1240
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:50,590
Caesar themed.

1241
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,590
Or Roman.

1242
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:57,560
Why is that?

1243
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,560
Why does a bunch of casinos have to be

1244
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:07,819
like, look where it's Roman?

1245
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:10,189
You know three casinos.

1246
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:12,189
No, that Roman kind of

1247
01:20:12,189 --> 01:20:15,880
architecture is everywhere down here.

1248
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:26,640
Bro, I live here.

1249
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:32,199
I don't live in a casino.

1250
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:35,600
That was my actually moment.

1251
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,960
I actually don't hate this.

1252
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:44,920
Yeah, definitely this.

1253
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,920
Definitely this.

1254
01:20:49,920 --> 01:21:03,550
That's perfect.

1255
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:05,850
It's so ugly.

1256
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,350
Most casinos are kind of ugly.

1257
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:13,149
They just are. They're very tacky, a lot of them.

1258
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:15,149
It's like Roman statues

1259
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:17,149
and bright green and pink

1260
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:19,149
and like orange and magenta

1261
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:21,149
colors.

1262
01:21:21,149 --> 01:21:23,149
They're wacky.

1263
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:25,149
I think that's why I like them.

1264
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:27,149
They're wacky places.

1265
01:21:27,149 --> 01:21:30,800
There's a fountain with a lion.

1266
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
You know, a lion statue.

1267
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,869
Guys, there's a casino boat here that has

1268
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:37,869
a fucking pirate ship in it.

1269
01:21:37,869 --> 01:21:40,359
It's bizarre.

1270
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,359
Oh yeah, there's a big pirate ship here.

1271
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:44,539
All right.

1272
01:21:44,539 --> 01:21:47,420
It's cool. It's just weird

1273
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:57,920
and tacky. It adds

1274
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,479
taste. Oh no, you said ADHD

1275
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:02,479
taste. I thought you were

1276
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:05,420
being nice. Okay.

1277
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,420
So this is going to be a bathroom.

1278
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:29,420
This room looks delicious.

1279
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,420
I want to come in here and just breathe the

1280
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,789
air in here without the toilets.

1281
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:37,949
I'm just saying the empty room.

1282
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:45,180
I mean,

1283
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,180
I just mean this.

1284
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,180
The way that it looks, I feel like it's clean

1285
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,180
and crisp.

1286
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,180
Forget about what goes in here after.

1287
01:22:55,479 --> 01:23:00,399
I'm doing it.

1288
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:03,850
Are you high? No, I'm not.

1289
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,850
Guys, I'm not high.

1290
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:09,119
All right, that's the bathroom.

1291
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,920
Dude, this is going to be sick.

1292
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,159
I need like a staff room too.

1293
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:21,000
All right, I can start putting stuff down.

1294
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,270
So I want

1295
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:27,399
table games here.

1296
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:29,770
Baccarat. Sweet game.

1297
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,949
Blackjack.

1298
01:23:31,949 --> 01:23:33,949
I don't really, you know, I don't like Blackjack

1299
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:35,949
that much anymore. I love Blackjack

1300
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:37,949
but you know what? The game kind of sucks, if I'm honest.

1301
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:42,039
PyGal. That's the game.

1302
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:44,989
Now that's the game.

1303
01:23:44,989 --> 01:23:46,989
This game, let me tell you something about PyGal.

1304
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:50,000
Ludwig put me on to this game.

1305
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And you can sit there

1306
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
all day and not lose any money.

1307
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Like, well, let me preface that

1308
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
by saying something very important.

1309
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yes, you will lose money. But like, it's the slowest

1310
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
fucking game in the whole casino.

1311
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,399
You can just sit there

1312
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:08,399
and just do little

1313
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:10,399
bets and it's so easy to

1314
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:15,199
push on PyGal. Blackjack

1315
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,199
is like, oh, you lose, oh, you lose,

1316
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,199
you lose, you lose, you lose, you lose.

1317
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,630
It takes like, it takes like fucking

1318
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,630
a full two or three minutes to do a game with PyGal.

1319
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,630
You just sit there.

1320
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,630
You can do fucking small little bets. It doesn't even matter.

1321
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:33,390
Don't play at the fucking casino though.

1322
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:41,180
Is that fun?

1323
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,180
Gambling is only fun

1324
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,180
if you go in with a small amount of money.

1325
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,180
A certain small amount of money that you

1326
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,180
know you're never going to get back.

1327
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:51,180
And it's a form of entertainment that you

1328
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,180
do very rarely.

1329
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,180
Every so often,

1330
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,550
rarely, is how

1331
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:00,239
I find fun with the game.

1332
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,600
Rarely. I lived in Vegas,

1333
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,600
right? I know how

1334
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,600
fucked up it can be.

1335
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,840
Trust me. But,

1336
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,659
I would be dishonest if I told you

1337
01:25:11,659 --> 01:25:13,659
that I didn't enjoy playing the games.

1338
01:25:13,659 --> 01:25:16,029
Uh, maybe every

1339
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:19,869
few months? But,

1340
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:24,800
that's it. Rarely, it's a

1341
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,550
what do you mean? I moved

1342
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:30,880
there. Dude, fuck off,

1343
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
we know you live in Wisconsin.

1344
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
What if I was just lying about living here the whole time?

1345
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,529
No,

1346
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:42,409
but PyGal is slow.

1347
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:44,409
The last couple times I played Blackjack,

1348
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:46,649
it's just like, okay,

1349
01:25:46,649 --> 01:25:48,649
I just, the dealer hit 20,

1350
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:50,649
dealer hit 21, dealer hit 19, dealer has

1351
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:52,649
20. Okay, well, what the fuck?

1352
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:59,050
It's been 10 minutes.

1353
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,050
He lives in Wisconsin.

1354
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:05,920
Yeah, gambling should only be

1355
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,920
a form of entertainment, very occasionally.

1356
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,920
That's how I feel about it.

1357
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,859
That's truly how I feel about it.

1358
01:26:12,859 --> 01:26:15,550
But I do enjoy it.

1359
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:17,550
Go out with friends, sit around a table,

1360
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:20,939
and just hang out. They got casinos

1361
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:22,939
in Wisconsin!

1362
01:26:22,939 --> 01:26:24,939
Do they actually, do they? I actually have no idea.

1363
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:29,159
You just seem bad.

1364
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:31,159
You guys, you can't be bad at a casino

1365
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:33,159
game. That's the thing you have to be, you want to

1366
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:35,159
talk about fucking what you need to get out of your

1367
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:37,159
head? You cannot be good

1368
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:39,159
at a casino game.

1369
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:41,159
There is no being good at a casino

1370
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,920
game, unless it's poker.

1371
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,920
Poker? Yes, you've, yes,

1372
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,920
there is some, there's a lot going on there.

1373
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,920
Poker, and some of those poker-oriented

1374
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,760
games are. Everything else at the casino

1375
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,930
is just throw a million

1376
01:26:55,930 --> 01:27:01,949
dice in the air and did you win. There's people that go

1377
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:03,949
and they sit down at a slot machine and they go, no, no, no,

1378
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:05,949
I know the secret. There is no secret.

1379
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:08,189
The secret is the gigantic math problem that's playing

1380
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,189
behind the reels.

1381
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:13,560
That's it. Even Blackjack. Blackjack

1382
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,560
has a low house edge, but it's just

1383
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,439
random on, I mean, unless

1384
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:20,439
you're like counting cards, which you can't do,

1385
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:22,880
and a lot of these casinos

1386
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
make sure you're not doing that. They have

1387
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
like 8 plus 10 plus

1388
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,609
deck games, so

1389
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:35,899
it's not, that's not gonna happen. It's

1390
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:39,930
illegal. You can't, it's not illegal.

1391
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:47,079
What? But anyways, like roulette

1392
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:49,079
too, like there is no like, no, no, no, no, no, I

1393
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:51,520
know the number it's gonna be. No, you don't

1394
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
know the number. Man, you just don't. You don't.

1395
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,520
It's literally a ball that spins around in a

1396
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,010
circle and lands on a

1397
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:01,020
random slot. You might get lucky,

1398
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,020
yeah, and when you do, nice.

1399
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,770
It's fucking fun. That's it.

1400
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:15,039
How come I can't unlock these? I need

1401
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,039
to research ultimate house advantage.

1402
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:19,850
Oh, I need a cashier cage.

1403
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:22,350
Okay, I need a cashier cage. Let's put that in

1404
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:31,310
here. But I'm not, I'm not gonna hear

1405
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:34,189
this thing. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you

1406
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,560
that what you shouldn't do

1407
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,560
with your money, right? But I'm gonna tell you

1408
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
to be careful with your money. That's it.

1409
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,659
Be fucking careful. It's really

1410
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:47,659
easy to get caught up in this shit. Just be fucking

1411
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:50,989
careful. Genuinely is.

1412
01:28:50,989 --> 01:28:57,239
How come this is not flush?

1413
01:28:57,239 --> 01:29:07,680
Why is this not flush? I want this to be

1414
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,979
flush with the wall. What the hell?

1415
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:16,189
It can't be flush? Oh, there needs to be

1416
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:18,189
a way for the cashier to get in.

1417
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:21,840
Oh, they're gonna be stuck.

1418
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,550
I'm sitting here going, why can't I make this

1419
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,550
flush against the wall? Cause they would never be

1420
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:30,239
able to leave. Okay,

1421
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:43,420
I get it. I'll have to.

1422
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,640
Somebody said, what do I feel about pineapple

1423
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,640
vodka? That's a great drink.

1424
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,640
That's a fantastic

1425
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,880
beverage. I would recommend if you

1426
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,880
are of the age to drink alcohol and

1427
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,430
responsibly can drink.

1428
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:00,800
It's a drink to drink. It's just simple.

1429
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,039
There's no bullshit.

1430
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:08,279
Not a bunch of nonsense. That's another thing.

1431
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:10,279
Guys, I only drink like

1432
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:12,279
five times, six times a year too.

1433
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:16,439
As our most celebrated, most

1434
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:19,069
intelligent scholar, Ben Franklin

1435
01:30:19,069 --> 01:30:22,010
said, all things in moderation.

1436
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:24,010
Ben Franklin was the smartest person in the world. That's why he's on the hundred.

1437
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:26,380
Ben's not on the one.

1438
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,380
Ben's not on the five. Ben's on

1439
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,380
the one hundred

1440
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,750
dollar bill. Why do you think that is?

1441
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,750
Why do you think Ben Franklin's on the one hundred?

1442
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:43,640
He's one hundred!

1443
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:52,409
Is that the guy from Jerma Rumble?

1444
01:30:52,409 --> 01:30:55,869
You know, there's a five hundred and a one thousand.

1445
01:30:55,869 --> 01:31:05,079
Yeah, okay.

1446
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:15,710
What's the one thousand? There's no

1447
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:31,960
one thousand note? There's no

1448
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,960
thousand dollar denomination. Wait,

1449
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:40,170
one thousand dollar bill.

1450
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:44,909
Like its smaller cousin,

1451
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:46,909
one thousand dollar bill was discontinued in

1452
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:49,149
1969. Who was on it?

1453
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:55,229
Grover Cleveland was on

1454
01:31:55,229 --> 01:31:57,229
the one thousand dollar bill?

1455
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:59,789
And William McKinley was on

1456
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:01,789
the five hundred dollar bill. They're not

1457
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:04,800
in circulation anymore. Wait,

1458
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Grover Cleveland was on the one thousand?

1459
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:14,279
What the hell? It existed,

1460
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:17,550
but doesn't exist anymore. All right, let's

1461
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:19,550
get a couple of roulette tables. Oh, we need

1462
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:36,000
ATMs. ATM Andy.

1463
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,920
But yeah, you're gonna,

1464
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,920
when you go into the casino, that money you bring in

1465
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,920
is, you need to go in with the mindset

1466
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,920
of, this is already

1467
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,920
gone. It's gone. Treat it

1468
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,920
like it's already gone. And that's it.

1469
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,930
Don't do anything else. You

1470
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:56,109
are going to lose it. You might win

1471
01:32:56,109 --> 01:32:58,109
and it's, well cool, you did it. Hooray!

1472
01:32:58,109 --> 01:33:00,989
Treat it like it's gone and that's it and have

1473
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:02,989
a good time with your friends. If you ever go to the, and

1474
01:33:02,989 --> 01:33:04,989
this is not, obviously I'm not trying to endorse a casino.

1475
01:33:04,989 --> 01:33:07,479
I'm just saying, that's how you should do

1476
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:09,479
it. Don't do it any other fucking way.

1477
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:11,789
I'm telling you, please listen to me.

1478
01:33:11,789 --> 01:33:15,949
If you're ever at a casino and you bring

1479
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:17,949
whatever you're going to bring

1480
01:33:17,949 --> 01:33:19,949
for the night or for the weekend or for the week,

1481
01:33:19,949 --> 01:33:22,569
that's it. And it's gone.

1482
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:25,199
Don't, do not

1483
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,199
take that extra step to be like,

1484
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,199
all right, I kind of blew through that.

1485
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,199
I'm gonna go to the ATM

1486
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,199
again. No, don't do it. Don't do it.

1487
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,760
Don't. Don't do it.

1488
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,760
Don't. Listen to me. Are you listening?

1489
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,920
Don't. Do that.

1490
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,920
I want you to think of me saying that, if you ever do that.

1491
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,909
And just, and then if you're, you know, if you're over 21,

1492
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:51,979
go get yourself a box of pineapple, you know?

1493
01:33:51,979 --> 01:33:54,539
And just sip on it. Just fucking walk around

1494
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:58,489
and la la. Okay.

1495
01:33:58,489 --> 01:34:02,840
Texas Hold'em, that should be another room

1496
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:10,970
for Texas Hold'em, right? I'll do what I want

1497
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:13,659
with my money. And you are completely,

1498
01:34:13,659 --> 01:34:16,159
that's, yeah, that's up to you. Just

1499
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,159
be fucking careful. Ben Franklin,

1500
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,159
Ben Franklin's gonna like turn into

1501
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,159
like a force ghost. He's gonna be in

1502
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,520
front of you. He's gonna have a cigar in his mouth.

1503
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,899
He's gonna have, he's gonna have,

1504
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:29,899
he's gonna have like a fucking invention in one hand.

1505
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:32,960
And like in his other hand, it's gonna be

1506
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,960
a, I don't know,

1507
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,199
I almost said chainsaw. He's gonna

01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,199
just show up. He's gonna just have like a, he's gonna have a

1509
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,199
kite in one hand. And

1510
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,199
a chainsaw in the other hand.

1511
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,369
And just, he force ghosts in front

1512
01:34:45,369 --> 01:34:47,369
of you. And I don't know what Ben Franklin

1513
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:49,369
sounded like, but I imagine it was something like this.

1514
01:34:49,369 --> 01:34:52,189
What you should do

1515
01:34:52,189 --> 01:34:54,189
is absolutely not

1516
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,189
find your way back to the ATM.

1517
01:34:56,189 --> 01:34:59,369
Turn around.

1518
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:01,369
All things in moderation, my friend.

1519
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:03,609
Leave the casino.

1520
01:35:03,609 --> 01:35:05,850
And go with your friends somewhere else.

1521
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:10,649

here we go okay just make a singular long bathroom no half the room is the bathroom you know how

1575
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:46,029
uncomfortable a small bathroom is i've stayed in hotels before where the bathroom was as big

1576
01:48:46,029 --> 01:49:01,020
as an airplane bathroom and it sucks i need room i need space i need room in the bathroom i hate

1577
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:07,050
the shit where you're sitting on the toilet and the toilet paper is essentially almost touching

1578
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:17,260
your leg and the sink is touching your elbow and the no give me some room give me some room i need

1579
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:34,380
room i've cursed out loud when i open up the door to the bathroom i see that the sink is within

1580
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:40,640
elbows reach of the toilet and it's a bit like wood it's like a box and you can literally just

1581
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,079
sit and squeeze in there until i don't know why people like what and some of these hotels are

1582
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:50,350
like fucking hundreds of dollars a night you know what i mean can i i'm gonna go off here

1583
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:55,449

1584
01:49:56,409 --> 01:49:59,210
let me preface this by saying i don't want to i'm not gonna i hope i don't piss anybody off

1585
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:05,500
with this but i don't think i will hotels that are like kind of old and that's the point where it's

1586
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:10,460
like oh yeah the room is like fucking old and the bathroom is old and the plumbing is old and the

1587
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:18,409
whole thing is fucking old well that'll be that'll be three or four hundred dollars a night i i i want

1588
01:50:18,569 --> 01:50:23,770
i want a bathroom that's fucking new i don't want to turn the shower on it's like

1589
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:31,470
and they have to sit there and wait for the water to get like 20 minutes 20 minutes with water get

1590
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:38,119
hot you know what i mean that's an overstatement but you know what i mean it's like just old for

1591
01:50:38,119 --> 01:50:51,100
the sake of being old and they cost more than just staying at like a regular ass hotel i just get all

1592
01:50:51,100 --> 01:51:01,520
this is all i want i want a clean room small with just a bed a functioning television and a clean

1593
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:07,560
bathroom and the plumbing works and it's not like oh well you know this uh this place has been here

1596
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:37,229

1597
01:51:44,109 --> 01:51:53,770
but you know what i'm talking about where it's like hey by the way we took this whole school gym

1598
01:51:54,729 --> 01:52:00,670
and we made it a hotel you know what i mean like i just i just want a fucking holiday in

1605
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:56,250
the machine is probably from like 1995 and when you they all make the same noise when you go up

1606
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:04,859
and you press the button you take your glass and you're gonna go and it's the most delicious

1607
01:53:04,859 --> 01:53:23,310
orange juice i've ever had dude that's just radioactive it's full of mold and the best part

1608
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:34,590
is you dude listen to me you can go up to that machine as many times as you want that old

1609

barely functioning orange juice machine you can go up there 10 times if you want it's bottomless

1610
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:59,239

1729
02:28:34,219 --> 02:29:05,319
these this is the kind of room that i would wake up in and i i don't know why i just thought of

1730
02:29:05,319 --> 02:29:10,940
this me and my family were on vacation one time this is a long time ago this and we were like

1731
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:19,950
little kids i was probably i don't know i want to say maybe 10 and we we like rented out this

1732
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:24,270
cabin or something and we were on like a big vacation to go out and like the go camping and

1733
02:29:24,270 --> 02:29:30,959
shit and they had these this big bedroom that was upstairs it was like this kind of big loft

1734
02:29:32,059 --> 02:29:39,360
and the ceiling was kind of slanted down and uh our beds were kind of up against the walls

1735
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:48,010
so because the way the ceilings were slanted when you when you were lying in the bed your head

1736
02:29:48,969 --> 02:29:55,450
it was kind of the ceiling kind of went diagonal over your head in a way and i'm trying to think

1737
02:29:55,450 --> 02:30:02,059
like exactly how the architecture was but my brother woke up in the morning

1738
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:08,479
and he like just got right out of bed in the morning and just smashed his head against like

1739
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:15,530
the ceiling it was the way that like the ceiling was angled i'm trying to forget how it happened

1740
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:23,770
but he just woke up and was like oh yay it just it was so excited to be to get out of bed and

1741
02:30:23,770 --> 02:30:30,879
just smash his head against the ceiling i don't know if they were like wooden frames or something

1742
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:35,930
i've done that before clown family

1743
02:30:51,180 --> 02:31:00,680
this stuck with me for a decade a decade two decades three decades i we were we were at the

1744
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:07,549
mall one time and we were walking around and there was this you know in the mall how there's those

1745
02:31:07,549 --> 02:31:14,399
big standing advertising kiosk things they have like three or four sides it's like a huge led like

1746
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:17,760
a big screen right and it's like there's an ad on this side or something on this side something

1747
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:26,200
on this side i i don't know why there was a goldie hawn movie that we were walking me my brother

1748
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:32,670
and like my family was in the mall and my brother for some reason thought thought that this goldie

1898
03:19:26,350 --> 03:19:37,209

2104
04:39:55,689 --> 04:40:05,689
a five percent chance to win ten grand you would bring camping equipment and sit here and you would

2105
04:40:05,689 --> 04:40:22,430
pack fucking ten sandwiches you wouldn't leave five percent odds yeah see this person's smart

2106

2107
04:40:38,759 --> 04:41:08,000
with 295 lost three or four spins and then left pissed one cent all you would have to do is hit

2108
04:41:08,000 --> 04:41:19,119
this one time and you would never lose ever you just need to hit this once it's a five percent

2109
04:41:19,119 --> 04:41:32,000
chance to win ten grand at one cent bet how is nobody hitting it i'm not crazy right this

2110
04:41:32,000 --> 04:41:50,590
costs one cent oh that's still pretty damn good oh the max prize is is a hundred dollars oh never
