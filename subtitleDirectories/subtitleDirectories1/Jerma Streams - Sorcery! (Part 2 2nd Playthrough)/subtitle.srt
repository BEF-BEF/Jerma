1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,610
I just want to warn everybody, I've changed my microphone settings.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,710
I haven't really talked into it properly yet.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,470
But a lot of you guys turned me way up and I'm just going to be very,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,570
very quiet because people turn the stream way up because they say that the

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,269
sound is super, super quiet.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,519
So I'm about to talk normally here and I think I may have finally

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,519
figured out what the hell has been going on with the stream

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,019
for the last like eight years.

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,420
So I'm going to talk normally now.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,969
So here's the thing that my microphone right now.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,170
How does it is this louder than normal?

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,770
Is this like, okay, this is perfect.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,770
This is you.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,469
This is way better because it's I can actually hear you now.

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,469
You're not like fucking 30% quieter than the game.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,740
This is Howard Stern audio.

17
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,109
Well, let me tell you something about Howard Stern.

18
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,409
Wait, hold on.

19
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,909
No, see not now.

20
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,810
It's now it's Howard Stern.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,620
Okay, so here's the thing.

22
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,519
I'm dancing with the stars.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,819
We had a couple of things happen.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,299
Okay, I think I may have fixed everything.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,200
Well, I'm going to get loud.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,299
Let's see what happens when I get loud.

27
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,590
A lot of people said, dude, when you get loud, you sound like you're

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,420
on NPR sound like you're 45.

29
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,969
Well, I changed to set the setup again.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm going to scream into the mic and I want people to understand.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,890
I'm going to yell every time I've gotten loud over the last two or

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,590
three weeks.

33
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,890
It goes like, oh, it sounds horrible.

34
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,790
So I'm going to scream.

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm going to not scream, but I'm going to be loud enough for you.

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,390
You know what I mean?

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,489
Here we go.

38
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:54,890
Ready?

39
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,890
Oh my goodness.

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,290
What the hell happened here?

41
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,689
Somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody somebody.

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,890
How's that?

43
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:08,180
Was it okay?

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,020
That's way better.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,199
It cuts out a little bit.

46
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,599
Okay.

47
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,599
Well, I mean that would have been un fucking bearable if I didn't

48
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,500
have this set up correctly.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Somebody somebody somebody somebody.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,939
It's not really loud for us.

51
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:29,139
Okay.

52
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:29,439
Good.

53
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:29,740
Good.

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,039
Very good.

55
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,340
Very good.

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,740
Very good.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
That was a good bugs of bunny.

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,159
Do it louder.

59
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,639
Okay.

60
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,539
How's that?

61
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,930
Is that okay?

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,830
Is that being compressed down?

63
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,030
Is that being pulled down and is that fucking up?

64
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,460
It's not bad.

65
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,659
Okay.

66
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,060
That was fine.

67
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,560
All right.

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,759
We look ladies and gentlemen, I think my audio is now fine.

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,360
My audio has been completely fixed.

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,870
It got a little crusty.

71
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,569
Well, it's going to get crusty.

72
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,069
You can't you if you scream into any microphone.

73
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,969
One of two things is going to happen one.

74
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,569
There's no gate or compression on it at all.

75
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,780
And it hurts and it actually hurts people's ears and it's like

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,180
a huge problem or there's too much compression and and you

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,680
sound like this, right?

78
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,639
I've been doing I'm telling you I've been sitting here for

79
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,340
at least an hour to two or three straight hours screaming

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,219
into this mic and like listening you were born crusty.

81
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:33,520
All right.

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,419
So so I've turned up myself a lot a lot.

83
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,219
So there's been complaints on this stream for almost a half

84
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,819
decade of how quiet I always am.

85
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,219
I am turned the fuck up now.

86
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,840
You understand and I figured out what happened.

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,919
So on my by the way, the internet I found the right server

88
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,219
took me like 45 minutes.

89
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,620
I tested some streams to different servers.

90
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,919
This one should be good.

91
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,020
We shouldn't have a single problem.

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,819
You ready for car?

93
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,219
Kari, are you ready for Kari?

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,919
Are you guys ready?

95
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,599
Is everybody?

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,900
Are you guys excited for Kari?

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,800
Is everyone excited for this because this is like my favorite

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,300
game ever made.

99
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,709
Get excited.

100
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,209
Get excited.

101
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:21,709
Get excited.

102
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,310
Get excited.

103
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,720
Get turned up.

104
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:25,920
Get turned up.

105
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,509
You were boxers or briefs.

106
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,439
I I don't know depends on the day.

107
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,100
It actually depends on the day.

108
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,569
All these all the okay.

109
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,670
All these brief haters, please.

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,300
It depends on the day right like box or briefs.

111
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,699
I actually don't really love boxers.

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,300
I think there's not enough support there.

113
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,100
It really just isn't enough support for me.

114
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,389
So I like I like the support.

115
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,189
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,290
What do you want me to say?

117
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,779
There's not enough support on boxers.

118
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,620
There just isn't that's not the wrong answer.

119
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,939
It's I'm just it really isn't okay.

120
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:30,939
So we're good to go.

121
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,339
I've got my audio fixed.

122
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,740
Let's do one more test.

123
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:34,639
Okay.

124
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:34,939
Okay.

125
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:35,240
Okay.

126
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,540
Okay.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:35,839
Okay.

128
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,139
Okay.

129
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:36,439
Okay.

130
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:36,740
Okay.

131
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,240
Okay.

132
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,839
Okay.

133
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:38,740
How's that?

134
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,829
That fine and we're gonna if you don't know what's happening here

135
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:45,430
if you do it didn't watch the stream yesterday.

136
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:46,930
Where have you been?

137
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,759
Where have you been?

138
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,600
First of all, second of all, we played sorcery across a million

139
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,199
followers.

140
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,600
It's kind of cool.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
It's really cool.

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
And we're gonna play more sorcery.

143
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,500
This is the tutorial is now over.

144
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,079
I hope you guys have decisions you're ready to make.

145
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm very interested to see what you do.

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,939
Let's see if we how close we come to the original playthrough.

147
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,899
God do I like this new audio setup makes you just want to

148
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,939
get nice and nice real and close and we talk to you directly

149
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,139
about how things are going.

150
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,129
Okay, you guys ready?

151
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,060
Turn your stream camera on.

152
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,360
I want to see spongebob.

153
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,860
What the hell?

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
What are you talking about?

155
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,149
Let's go.

156
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,149
So we're about to start.

157
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,850
We I did the intro already.

158
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,699
So people understand that this is where we are.

159
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,269
This is where we started and as you see here for people

160
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,759
that weren't here yesterday, I I want to make sure people

161
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,860
get like so this is where you start and here's the game

162
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,759
map, right?

163
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,060
It's right here.

164
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,959
It ends about right here.

165
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,560
So the big we storm the castle.

166
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
It's about like a 45 minute experience.

167
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,720
You still had no idea.

168
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,120
They had no idea.

169
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,560
I am so happy to play this again.

170
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
It's bigger than Elden Ring.

171
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,040
Yeah, Limgrave is this big on the map.

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,639
That's how big Limgrave is.

173
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,199
This is going to take us two to three thousand hours to get

174
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,600
through this.

175
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,069
Okay, so we have who's the God right now.

176
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:42,870
The God is the ape.

177
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,370
We already used the ape, but they don't really care anymore.

178
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,120
This dude's on gas station weed.

179
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Watch out.

180
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,019
What?

181
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,199
Wait, do you think I'm on gas station weed?

182
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,300
You can't sell weed at a gas station.

183
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,000
That's wicked funny though.

184
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,819
Gas station weed.

185
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
That's such a huge insult for some reason.

186
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,420
I don't know why.

187
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,720
I don't know.

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,670
Why am I like, why am I so insulted by what that person

189
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,170
just said?

190
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,379
No, you know, I got one guy chat moment of the year earlier

191
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,279
in the pre stream chat.

192
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,779
Somebody said their name is Psycho.

193
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,079
Psych.

194
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,779
So I have to give credit here because it's hilarious.

195
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,899
Jerma downloaded his consciousness into his Samsung

196
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,000
Galaxy fridge and he's playing fart simulator with the

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
crisper draw settings.

198
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,850
That's just that's just funny.

199
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,750
It just is and I have to give credit for it because like

200
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,549
what if that's actually funny.

201
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,950
Like genuinely funny.

202
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,830
Crisp the draw like okay that you made that comment funny.

203
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,129
Like the only reason why that's funny is because the

204
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,029
crisper draw settings comment that makes the whole thing

205
00:08:59,029 --> 00:08:59,330
funny.

206
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,129
You get it.

207
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:00,830
You understand comedy.

208
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,230
I'm glad.

209
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:05,759
All right.

210
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,259
You guys ready?

211
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:06,759
I'm ready.

212
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,259
I'm excited.

213
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,159
Here's what we have.

214
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,759
If everyone let's take a look at what we've got for items

215
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,360
to remind you from yesterday.

216
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,639
We have two quantities of these wax cloth skull cap a

217
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,340
bamboo flute 12 goblin teeth and a giant's tooth.

218
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:24,919
We have a lot of teeth.

219
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,759
Actually, I'll be honest.

220
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,360
I don't think I've ever had this many goblin teeth in an

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,059
entire playthrough.

222
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,220
I think we got the maximum amount of teeth we could

223
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,200
possibly get for goblin teeth so we can use whenever we

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,100
want all the time.

225
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm just gonna be throwing this at people for fun.

226
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:48,570
Here we go.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Twilight already.

228
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,340
The great city of Kare has loomed large on the horizon

229
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,649
all day but has been slow to reach the path tracing great

230
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,649
loops back and forth through a deep and narrow paths.

231
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,730
Look at that.

232
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,110
Look at this artwork.

233
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,350
Dude, look at this artwork.

234
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,799
Fuck on.

235
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,559
You've not seen a living soul except once when a dark

236
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,899
figure raced across the hilltops overhead and it was

237
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:29,600
lost from view.

238
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,809
So you're naturally curious.

239
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,500
You're naturally cautious when you round a bend in the

240
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,799
path and see a beggar crouch low against a rock muttering

241
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,399
to himself.

242
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:44,190
The beggar.

243
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,590
You stop out of sight behind an outcrop but the beggar

244
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,789
does not look much like a threat at all.

245
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:56,629
See what he does.

246
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:58,759
You watch in silence.

247
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,559
The beggar is an unfortunate soul.

248
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,259
His head twitches from one side to the other every few

249
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,059
minutes and he mutters and murmurs to himself.

250
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,490
You're hiding in the rocks, sir.

251
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,279
Hiding in the rocks.

252
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
And approach him or we can try to get by.

253
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,399
One voice.

254
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,299
There is one voice, but I do it good.

255
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,340
Approach.

256
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,960
You call a greeting and stride over and he leaps to his

257
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,259
feet drawing a short stick from inside his cloak.

258
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,330
Who goes there?

259
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,029
What's your business in Kare?

260
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,360
Greetings old man.

261
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,860
I'm a traveler.

262
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,460
I'm on a quest.

263
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,259
Get out of my way.

264
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,120
How about greetings?

265
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,419
Yeah.

266
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,690
Get out of my way.

267
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,090
You can't don't just be mean for no reason.

268
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,340
Get out of my way.

269
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,169
I'm a traveler.

270
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm a traveler.

271
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,700
The man pokes his stick at you.

272
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,399
A traveler?

273
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,299
Traveling where?

274
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,019
The backlands.

275
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,720
Kare.

276
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,519
This is my business, not yours.

277
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,899
My business, not yours.

278
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,470
I mean, that's my business, right?

279
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,549
I mean, I could say I'm just going to Kare, right?

280
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,450
Why would I want to be on this road?

281
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,740
Kare.

282
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,879
Obviously Kare, but why?

283
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:45,980
Ah, why?

284
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,179
Answer me or you'll face the consequences.

285
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,049
I said ow as if he was poking himself.

286
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:52,750
You know, you get it.

287
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,009
What consequences?

288
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:56,710
Step aside.

289
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,210
Who are you?

290
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:00,679
Who are you?

291
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:03,440
Who are you, you ask?

292
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,740
You're certainly very brave.

293
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:07,929
The man beams with aging pride.

294
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,870
I am the city guard.

295
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,570
No one enters Kare except through me.

296
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,500
And then despite his age and clear ill health,

297
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,399
he comes at you waving his stick.

298
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:19,529
Fight him.

299
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,529
I won't fight you.

300
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,870
Let's get the first pull of the night here.

301
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:25,769
For the day.

302
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,480
Do we fight the old man?

303
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,379
Or do we not fight the old man?

304
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,240
Gonna fight a beggar Omegalo.

305
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Fight, kill.

306
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,919
I won't.

307
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,899
Well, let's see.

308
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,019
What do they say today?

309
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,299
He poked us with a stick.

310
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,399
Yes, he did.

311
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,759
Well, it looks like you've decided.

312
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:26,649
All right.

313
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,350
That's pretty, that's pretty, don't say unanimous.

314
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,149
They hate that.

315
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,620
Yeah, don't say unanimous.

316
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:43,330
All right.

317
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,029
We're not going to fight.

318
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,879
Resident sleeper chat.

319
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,620
I almost clicked fight him.

320
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,019
All right.

321
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,320
Don't, I won't fight you.

322
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:58,679
You are unarmed.

323
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,240
He waves the stick close to your face jabbing a few times,

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,440
but you push the point aside with one hand.

325
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,929
All right, then.

326
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:06,929
He declares.

327
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,429
We'll settle this fairly.

328
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,759
He tosses the stick to one side and raises his fists.

329
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,360
The knuckles are blackened with scabs.

330
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay.

331
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,950
You get another opportunity.

332
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,769
So we fight him or don't fight him?

333
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,519
Scabs all over his knuckles.

334
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,539
What do you think?

335
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,980
I can manually end the poll after 30 seconds.

336
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,080
Yeah, that's a yeah, definitely.

337
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,820
Yeah, they don't have these don't have to be 60 seconds.

338
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,120
You can manually end the poll in like 20 to 30 seconds.

339
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,120
Would you I wouldn't fight this person.

340
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,970
Oh shit.

341
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:08,769
Oh, no.

342
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,370
Okay.

343
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
Oh fuck.

344
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,529
Oh man.

345
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:16,830
All right.

346
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,529
I don't I don't think anybody's ever clicked this button before guys.

347
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,340
Fight him.

348
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,870
Sighing you roll up your sleeves.

349
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,730
Should I just go full blast and just punch him right in the face?

350
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,730
Oh shit defense.

351
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,009
The beggar is not a powerful opponent.

352
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,009
You should be able to easily overpower him.

353
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,409
So you begin with a heavy punch giving it everything you have.

354
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,990
The beggar lifts his fists in defense.

355
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,190
So you land the minimum amount of damage against him.

356
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,629
Prepare to see stars.

357
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,529
He declares you better put him up.

358
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,920
Oh fuck that.

359
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,420
Okay.

360
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,640
I didn't think he even had that much.

361
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,079
That's annoying.

362
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,019
The beggar tries to knock you out in one swing.

363
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,220
This is much higher than your attack.

364
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,519
So you are hurt.

365
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:24,619
You suffer more damage because you left yourself so undefended

366
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,920
and he leaves you winded.

367
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,829
He is breathless and about to swing with a little force.

368
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,730
However, you are also weakened.

369
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,329
So you should defend and rebuild your power.

370
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:35,829
No, fuck that.

371
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,490
That's it.

372
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,549
You play it carefully and punch with a weak attack overpowering

373
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,549
the beggar who tries a low careful attack.

374
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,750
He is wheezing and breathless.

375
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,990
Why am I doing so little damage?

376
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:57,359
You tense your biceps and swing with a strong arm overpowering

377
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,660
the beggar again who tries a weak attack.

378
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,900
This time I'll knock you down.

379
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,180
He declares I could have killed him.

380
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,519
You defend yourself the beggar attempts a strong attack,

381
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,220
but you receive only a small amount of damage.

382
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,019
You'll be weaker now.

383
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,319
So his next attack will be lower.

384
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,819
Why you he grumbles preparing a medium swing this time.

385
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:17,519
I've got you.

386
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,819
I should think if you want to try it.

387
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:22,960
All right, he's done.

388
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,059
You level a powerful blow beating the beggar the beggar pants

389
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,359
and groans and then collapses into the dirt.

390
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
You roll your sleeves back down.

391
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,519
All right, then he murmurs into the ground weakly waving a hand.

392
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,869
You can pass walk on or help him up.

393
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:43,970
I mean help him up.

394
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,240
I'm just I'm helping him holding out a hand.

395
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,339
You help him upright.

396
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,039
He sits up and dust down his tattered clothing a gray cloak.

397
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,240
That was once a uniform.

398
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
He's shivering.

399
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,440
The evening is drawing in and it must get cold out here.

400
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,759
You don't have any food.

401
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,259
Do you?

402
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,059
He asks sadly.

403
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,900
No, I don't actually.

404
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,839
I actually don't sorry.

405
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,940
No, you shake your head.

406
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,099
The man sighs and shakes his head.

408
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,099
No matter then.

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
There's plenty of meat on a grass vole.

410
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,599
If you know how to nibble him.

411
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:21,279
Farewell.

412
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,380
Good luck or come with me.

413
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,819
Anytime I play a video game and there's a opportunity for an old person

414
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:30,720
to come hang out with you.

415
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,329
It's just if I made the Wizard of Oz today, like if it was me like I was

416
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:38,630
like, oh, I'm going to make the Wizard of Oz.

417
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,029
It would just be three old men in their fucking 80s.

418
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,079
I that's the only people that I ever like apparently hang out with.

419
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,329
It's like, oh yeah, that's that's yeah, I want to get my companions.

420
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,630
I'll take the old guy, the old guy, the old guy, the old guy.

421
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,829
No, I don't want the strong person.

422
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:02,130
I don't want the cool mage.

423
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,130
No, no, no, just give me three or four old people.

424
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,480
We they always come with us.

425
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm dropping frames again, aren't I?

426
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,549
I don't get it.

427
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:14,559
That's weird.

428
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,160
I don't get it.

429
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,859
I literally streamed to the test server of this server that I'm on right

430
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,960
now for an hour and 40 minutes with no drop frames.

431
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,089
I don't get it.

432
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,319
I literally did the exact same thing.

433
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,319
I don't understand.

434
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,940
What's happening here?

435
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,759
Are you guys seeing any of this?

436
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,799
Only shows six skipped frames.

437
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,000
Why is it showing that on mine?

438
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:48,619
Really?

439
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,119
No, yeah, I'm definitely seeing it.

440
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,019
What the heck?

441
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,220
I literally just did it.

442
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,019
I mean, okay, I streamed to this server with the test server settings

443
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,160
and it was fine.

444
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,259
Why is it doing this?

445
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,559
What the fuck?

446
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:03,150
Okay, whatever.

447
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,250
If it looks fine, it looks fine.

448
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:07,130
Okay, here we go.

449
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,420
It's a text game.

450
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,119
So it's fine.

451
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Yeah, but that still sucks though that for anything other than what

452
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,920
we're doing right now.

453
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
This is a huge problem.

454
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,920
Okay, it's actually fine for us.

455
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,220
Um, let me open this.

456
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,420
Hold on.

457
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,420
Give me one second because this is this actually makes no sense.

458
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,049
I mean one sec.

459
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,710
Like how could it be possible that I would stream to this server

460
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:45,309
and then turn it off and turn it on again without the test server?

461
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:46,809
And it's a bunch of problems.

462
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:47,710
That makes no sense.

463
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,410
I'm literally streaming to the same exact server.

464
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,109
The same ingest server.

465
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,410
No, no difference.

466
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,869
Zero difference.

467
00:21:55,069 --> 00:22:05,390
What the fuck?

468
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,440
All right.

469
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,039
Well, whatever.

470
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,859
I mean, I apparently have dropped 2,000 frames in the last five minutes.

471
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:15,160
If you guys aren't seeing that then I don't understand.

472
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:17,869
It's very weird.

473
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,549
Okay, whatever.

474
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,089
If you can't tell you can't tell but I'm pissed about it.

475
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,160
Okay, so should we he's going to come with us.

476
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:38,400
You take pity on the man.

477
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:39,859
Come with me.

478
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm going into Kare.

479
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,420
Soldier considers your offer for a moment.

480
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:45,960
You sure?

481
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,289
I know the word for the wall, but they will not want to let me through the gate.

482
00:22:53,230 --> 00:23:01,190
Okay, sounds like we can help each other.

483
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,900
He clamors slowly to his feet.

484
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,799
A gleam of hope is entered the poor man's eyes.

485
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,400
Very well then stranger a trade.

486
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:23,869
All the paths.

487
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,440
The beggar walks a few strides ahead the ghost of a military pace in his step.

488
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,430
What's your name or walk?

489
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,230
Yeah, what's your name?

490
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:38,130
Let's find out.

491
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,619
What's your name?

492
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,799
Captain Thomas of the fourth Legion responsible for the southern perimeter.

493
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,900
He knocks his bony heels together.

494
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,369
At your service.

495
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:55,680
Okay.

496
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,180
What are you doing here soldier?

497
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I think you're delusional.

498
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,059
What are you doing out here?

499
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,450
We were sent to investigate sightings.

500
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,349
He replies still panting for breath.

501
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:18,250
A whole Legion of us back when the council felt bold,

502
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,230
but then they locked the gate and wouldn't let us back.

503
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,950
Where's your Legion now sightings of what they locked you out of the city.

504
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,910
They locked you.

505
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,309
Well, okay.

506
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,410
They locked you out of the city.

507
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,180
They locked the goblins out too.

508
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,940
He replies if the goblins were gone, they'd let us in but they aren't gone.

509
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
They're in the rocks.

510
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,349
I don't see anything.

511
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,650
What are the goblins doing?

512
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:59,700
This is a teeth opportunity more teeth.

513
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,500
It's time to get more teeth.

514
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,029
What are they doing?

515
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,460
What are the goblins doing?

516
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,930
He shakes his head.

517
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,519
I don't know.

518
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,799
They can't get through the walls, but then I think I've heard them digging,

519
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,000
scraping at the mud in the night.

520
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:23,960
The path winds through gorse and thick grass.

521
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,160
Kari squats in a basin in the hills like a stagnant festering pool.

522
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,920
You turn one corner then another and the stone walls of the city are looming over you.

523
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,779
The end of the path.

524
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,380
So we're going up.

525
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,380
Where's the gate?

526
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,380
It's gate time.

527
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,589
The walls weren't built to keep anything out.

528
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,559
They were here before the goblins Thomas says.

529
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,750
They were built to keep people in.

530
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,589
Kari is one gigantic trap itself.

531
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,200
Why?

532
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,799
I'll be leaving and you want to go back?

533
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,599
Don't talk.

534
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,059
Don't talk.

535
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,009
Why?

536
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,269
Are the people inside not happy?

537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,599
Would you be happy ruled by pirates and thieves?

538
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,500
He points.

539
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Cast your eyes up.

540
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,700
You can see them.

541
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,700
Archers.

542
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,380
Facing in both directions.

543
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,200
You could scramble up the slope to the right to get a better view of the wall.

544
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:25,059
If you wanted to.

545
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,930
All right, we're going in the clearing.

546
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,730
We're going up the slope.

547
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:41,009
I guess I could make this decision.

548
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:42,309
Let's go up the slope.

549
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,740
You scramble up the slope for a better view of the wall leaving Thomas below.

550
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,519
Seems your new friend was right.

551
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,019
Standing atop the huge stone block is a guard with a long bow.

552
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,720
Slung across his shoulder.

553
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,450
What do we what do we do here?

554
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,500
Ask for advice.

555
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,119
Watch the archer look into the yard.

556
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:09,670
Let's watch.

557
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,140
You keep watching the guard above the gate looks this way and that but doesn't shift from his position.

558
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,559
Run for it.

559
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,859
Wait like run to the gate.

560
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,990
Start sprinting to the wall.

561
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,079
I'm so far away.

562
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,279
I'm going to get insta-killed.

563
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:30,910
Run for it.

564
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,589
Let's go down into the pass down into the pass.

565
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,789
I'm not going to run for it.

566
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:39,789
That means that's dumb.

567
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:41,819
There's nothing else for it.

568
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:43,319
You put a hand up and call out.

569
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,789
The archer lifts a hand to shield his eyes against the sun.

570
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,319
Who goes there?

571
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,819
Friend or foe?

572
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,730
Friend.

573
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,430
Foe.

574
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:54,529
Neither.

575
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,140
This is the dumb thing to do, right?

576
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,339
This is how you're going to die either way.

577
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,980
If you say this you're dead.

578
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,380
If you say that you're dead.

579
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,180
If you say this you're dead.

580
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,549
If you say this let Thomas answer, right?

581
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,950
Yeah, okay, Thomas knows the...

582
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,750
He knows.

583
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,440
You wait and Thomas cries back.

584
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,970
Friend!

585
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
And the watchword is catapani!

586
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,079
The guard pauses a moment

587
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,480
then lowers his bow.

588
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:22,970
Approach!

589
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,349
Thomas turns and smiles at you.

590
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,420
Okay, approach the gate.

591
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,920
The south gate stands before you.

592
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,319
It is as tall as two men

593
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,599
and would be broad enough to ride three horses through.

594
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
If only it were open.

595
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,039
But instead it is locked

596
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,039
and there's no other way into the city.

597
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,839
Luckily, of course, you have a key.

598
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,000
Over to you?

599
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,500
Says Thomas stepping back.

600
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,190
Knock on the door.

601
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,589
Unlock the gate with the key or cast a spell.

602
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,769
What's available right now?

603
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,269
I wonder.

604
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,019
Is this Doth?

605
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,349
Okay, so you can throw a fireball at the door.

606
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:07,750
Which would be insane.

607
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,380
I don't think I would make it out of that alive.

608
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,339
We could do big.

609
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,640
I have the key.

610
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,039
I just use the key or just let him do it, right?

611
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,440
Why would I do this on my own?

612
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,400
Should I impress everybody that I can do it?

613
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,400
It's a waste of stamina.

614
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:30,250
Okay.

615
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,420
Unlock the gate with the Swin Chief's key

616
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,019
or just knock on the door.

617
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,799
Yeah, but am I allowed in here?

618
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,380
Wouldn't they think this is weird?

619
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm going to do it.

620
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,319
You quickly remove the Swin Chief's key from your pack

621
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,319
and slip it into the lock.

622
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,950
The tumblers

623
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:52,950
click

624
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,150
as the key turns.

625
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:55,720
Thomas hangs back.

626
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,799
Good work.

627
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,000
But do you think it's safe to go through?

628
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,029
It sure is.

629
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,730
Why don't you check?

630
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,430
I'll go first.

631
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,029
Let's wait.

632
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,920
Why don't you check?

633
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,359
You do it.

634
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,220
You do it.

635
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:15,230
What do you guys think?

636
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,829
Let's do a poll.

637
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:16,230
I'm curious.

638
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,930
What do you guys want to do?

639
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:23,849
Push the old guy in first.

640
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,440
We need to keep Thomas alive.

641
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:40,670
Clueless.

642
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,579
Is it safe?

643
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:50,740
What do you guys think?

644
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:54,730
You're doing the polls

645
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,430
because you want chat to choose the mean one.

646
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,930
I mean, well, I'm doing the poll

647
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,630
because I want chat to choose the mean one

648
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,829
and I want nothing to do with it

649
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,430
because I probably would have chosen a mean one

650
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,029
and everybody would have gone,

651
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,930
oh my God, dude, go back.

652
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,230
You left her.

653
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,130
You left her there.

654
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,029
Why would you do that?

655
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,630
So that's not on me anymore, right?

656
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,230
Remember all of yesterday?

657
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,240
Dude, you actually should rewind.

658
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,640
I didn't like that.

659
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,099
If you picked it,

660
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,500
you all would have been yelling at each other and not me.

661
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:24,109
All right.

662
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:24,609
What are we doing?

663
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,150
Is it safe?

664
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,150
We're going to wait.

665
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,549
Okay.

666
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:29,890
Let's wait.

667
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,250
Let's wait, you say.

668
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:34,349
Thomas nods.

669
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,049
A few heartbeats pass,

670
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,150
but you hear nothing from inside the yard.

671
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,500
Then he shakes his head.

672
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm going for it.

673
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Thank you, stranger.

674
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:43,799
And with that,

675
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,400
he dashes away inside.

676
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,920
You hear nothing for a moment

677
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,619
than the sound of shouting voices and feet rushing away.

678
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:52,920
He just didn't give a shit.

679
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,680
Go in after Thomas or wait.

680
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,119
Okay.

681
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,420
So a few heartbeats,

682
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,119
that's kind of funny.

683
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,420
Considering a few heartbeats is like two seconds.

684
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,769
He didn't even sit there for two seconds

685
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:08,970
before he got impatient and went in.

686
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,059
Go help him.

687
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,150
What did I do before?

688
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,950
I actually don't remember.

689
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,349
What did I do?

690
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:22,349
I don't even know what I did before.

691
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:28,339
Go.

692
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm going in after him.

693
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:30,960
Slipping inside,

694
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,460
you find the yard deserted.

695
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,059
The old soldier has cleared it out for you.

696
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,859
You push the great gate closed.

697
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,359
He's still in the lock.

698
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,299
Whoever the next ruffian to visit Carré may be,

699
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,500
he will be grateful for your little gift

700
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,019
gotten through the gate.

701
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,720
How fast is your heartbeat?

702
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:53,799
What are you talking about?

703
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,460
A few heartbeats is

704
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,390
That's like two seconds.

705
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,390
That's not even two seconds.

706
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,140
You pause just inside the shadow of the gate.

707
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,589
To your left is a low stone building

708
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,990
with metal bars for windows.

709
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,779
Duck behind the building.

710
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,779
Hurry out of the yard

711
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,779
or try the door to the low building.

712
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,180
All right.

713
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,880
What do you guys want to do?

714
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,380
This is important.

715
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,140
What do you want to do?

716
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,539
Duck behind the building.

717
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,640
Get hurry out

718
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,740
or try the door.

719
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,450
You got to hurry up

720
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,250
before the guards get back.

721
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,549
But wait, who knows?

722
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,039
Do you hide?

723
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,140
Do you try the door?

724
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,740
Do you duck?

725
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,339
Do you run?

726
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,210
All these choices are up to you.

727
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,779
In sorcery.

728
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:50,859
Part two.

729
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,059
Carré.

730
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,460
City board of traps.

731
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,410
Stop doing the game show host voice.

732
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,710
I know you didn't say stop doing that,

733
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,809
but that's what I said.

734
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,760
All right.

735
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,800
What are we doing?

736
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,829
Try the door.

737
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:21,230
Okay.

738
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,329
Try the door to the low building.

739
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,130
You go over to the door.

740
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:24,929
It is locked.

741
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,329
But the key is still in the keyhole.

742
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,599
At that moment,

743
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,400
two soldiers march around the corner.

744
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Dive inside the building

745
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
or greet the guards.

746
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,380
Oh, hello.

747
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,079
How are you?

748
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,179
Good to see you again.

749
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:42,570
What do you think?

750
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,369
Should I just greet them?

751
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,500
I haven't done anything wrong, right?

752
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,389
Like did I do anything wrong?

753
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,059
I was let in here.

754
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm not...

755
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,360
Okay, the old man ran in

756
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,659
and did like a bunch of weird shit.

757
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,860
Why am I not allowed in here?

758
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:03,179
I'm going to greet them.

759
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,980
There's no time for anything but a gamble.

760
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,920
You stride right up to the guards.

761
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,059
You there!

762
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,460
You declare.

763
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,650
Why wasn't there anyone to meet me

764
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,150
at the gate?

765
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:18,260
The man looks baffled.

766
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,010
What gate?

767
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,150
Who are you?

768
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm the ambassador from Anorland.

769
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,650
I'm the new chief mage of Kaare.

770
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,849
I mean, which one of these is more believable?

771
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:34,550
Probably the first one.

772
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,480
The chief mage?

773
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,250
Should I say chief mage?

774
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,289
I'm the ambassador from Anorland.

775
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:49,590
I'm the chief mage.

776
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,789
I'm the new chief mage.

777
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,429
I'm the new chief mage of Kaare.

778
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,519
The guard looks panicked.

779
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,820
No one.

780
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,619
No one told us you were coming, sir.

781
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,659
I should turn you into a frog.

782
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,659
No matter.

783
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:07,869
I should turn you into a frog.

784
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,829
Sir.

785
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:11,969
What can I do for you, sir?

786
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,679
Take me to the north gate.

787
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
The guard peers at you.

788
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,349
The north gate?

789
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,050
Why?

790
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,650
No one goes there.

791
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,750
It's haunted, cursed, and locked.

792
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,070
That's exactly what I'm here for.

793
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,679
Are you questioning me?

794
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,780
Then I'll handle this myself.

795
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,239
Number two.

796
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,110
Yeah, I like number two.

797
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,119
You questioning me?

798
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,000
No, sir.

799
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:46,800
This way, sir.

800
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,380
All right.

801
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,510
Hey, let's go.

802
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,010
Follow the guard.

803
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,179
The guard marches along the road and you follow

804
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,480
until you reach the top of the south gate yard.

805
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,429
Sir, I can't leave my post, sir.

806
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,599
The guard says.

807
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,199
But if you follow this road, you'll find your way into Kaare.

808
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:12,719
And from there?

809
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,659
The quickest route to the center is the main road through the fields.

810
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,659
The guard answers.

811
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:20,630
Avoid the less pleasant areas of town.

812
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,900
You should avoid the festival too, sir, if you value your purse.

813
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,840
The guard clicks his heels.

814
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,510
You frown severely and take your leave as quick as possible.

815
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:35,570
Interesting.

816
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,099
Interesting.

817
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,710
The quickest route to the center is the main road through the fields.

818
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,150
Avoid the less pleasant areas of town.

819
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,849
Well, that's not up to me.

820
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:45,550
It's going to be up to you.

821
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,090
So I guess I'm I guess I'm going to go this way for now.

822
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,440
Interesting.

823
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,139
Ooh, this is interesting.

824
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:01,070
Okay, show the map.

825
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,070
I will in just one sec.

826
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,559
Night is falling.

827
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,289
Luckily by the roadside is a small inn, which will make perfect place

828
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,889
to stay before you lose yourself in the winding streets of Kaare.

829
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,820
Alternatively, you could walk into the fields to the right and sleep

830
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,619
out under the stars.

831
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,550
From somewhere nearby, you hear a low baying howl.

832
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:22,840
Where we going?

833
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,019
Where are we off to?

834
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:28,750
You want to see the map?

835
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:30,929
Here is the map.

836
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,130
This is where we are right now.

837
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,530
And as you can say, this is there's a lot going on here.

838
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:43,739
It's cat.

839
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:47,889
All these animals.

840
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,519
What do you guys want to do?

841
00:38:59,269 --> 00:38:59,969
Actually, you know what?

842
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,670
I I want to go to the inn.

843
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,860
We got money.

844
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,960
I'm making a decision.

845
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,360
We're going to the inn.

846
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:12,739
A sign outside the inn proclaims it the crooked finger.

847
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:16,449
Look at that map inside of a map.

848
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,530
Let's go in.

849
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,349
You go inside and find an empty bar.

850
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,949
The bartender is snoozing at the counter.

851
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,750
Clearly trade is bad.

852
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,750
Sleep outside in front of the inn or approach the bar.

853
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,550
Get a good look at what it looks like in here.

854
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:46,880
I'm ever going to the bar, right?

855
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,579
The bartender wakes with a snortle as you approach.

856
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,219
Greetings traveler.

857
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,929
You'll be looking for directions to somewhere else.

858
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:56,829
I suppose.

859
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:00,840
I need to eat.

860
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:03,559
There's no food here.

861
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,559
I'm afraid.

862
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,949
The innkeeper says no point since the rats get it all but a bed

863
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,449
for the night will cost you seven gold pieces.

864
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:13,829
That's way too much.

865
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,360
Actually too much.

866
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,659
Seven gold pieces is robbery.

867
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:20,019
You tell him the innkeeper shrugs.

868
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,909
Carray prices might not be what you're used to but you can

869
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:28,110
sleep in the street if you prefer and then maybe you'll see

870
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,710
why they're as high as they are.

871
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,730
That's too much.

872
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,789
Seven gold seven gold pieces.

873
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:45,670
I do I need to eat though.

874
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,820
Otherwise you'd lose.

875
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,449
I think I think you lose max stamina if you don't eat for

876
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:50,750
a day.

877
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,380
I could sleep with the rats.

878
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,079
Um, no, no fuck you.

879
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,309
It's too high and you turn to leave.

880
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,510
Wait a minute.

881
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:05,650
The innkeeper says he reaches under the counter and produces

882
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,949
a handful of dice.

883
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,969
You want to play swindle stones?

884
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,489
Maybe we can settle this with a game.

885
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,150
I don't play games.

886
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,650
I know.

887
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,449
I don't know the rules.

888
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:17,750
I'll play you in swindle stones.

889
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,039
Let's go by the way.

890
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,599
Excuse me.

891
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,599
Excuse me.

892
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,400
You you want to start a new twitch meta guys swindle stones

893
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,500
new twitch meta.

894
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:36,230
Let's go is literally liars dice with like one small change,

895
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,500
but whatever I'll play you.

896
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,900
You reply taking a seat at the bar.

897
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,199
Excellent.

898
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,800
The innkeeper rubs his hands together clearly thinking he

899
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
will be able to hustle you out of some money.

900
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,179
So what's the steak?

901
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,179
No steak at four at the cost of the room.

902
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,039
The cost of the room you suggest seven gold pieces.

903
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
You place a stack of coins on the bar.

904
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,719
The innkeeper grins and rubs his hands together.

905
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:09,519
Sounds like my kind of game.

906
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,409
The innkeeper counts out five dice each and takes first bid.

907
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:21,139
Okay, so swindle stones is an interesting game.

908
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:21,940
It's just liars dice.

909
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,099
Essentially the game is simple.

910
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:26,099
We roll and bet on what's come up.

911
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:30,739
So for instance, I might start and bet that between us we've

912
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:34,199
rolled at least two threes, right?

913
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,059
Well, we don't know what's on the table.

914
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:40,360
So you have to essentially you have to guess of what how you

915
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,159
want you bluff.

916
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,630
You're trying to catch people in getting it incorrect.

917
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,179
So I could call right and say I don't think there are two

918
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,599
threes between the two of us and that would be a really

919
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,199
stupid idea because if I did that he might just have two

920
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,400
threes and have started with that.

921
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:57,610
This is in The Witcher.

922
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,610
It's Witcher's Yahtzee.

923
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,809
No, it's Steve Jackson's Sorcery Swindle Stones.

924
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,610
This game came out like 50 years ago.

925
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:07,110
I'm sorry, but this is the one that it's based on.

926
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,739
What I have here is I have three fours.

927
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,210
So I could essentially just go I got we got I got two.

928
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,579
Hey there I got there are two fours, right?

929
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:22,980
Because I know I have at least two of them.

930
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,860
That's what I'm going to say.

931
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:31,760
Indeed.

932
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,460
So I can't see your dice and you can't see mine.

933
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,190
You only have what I tell you about what I've got, but you

934
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,090
may be trying to deceive me.

935
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,920
Okay, so that means he has so he has a four.

936
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,659
I wonder if he has two fours because this would be correct.

937
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,559
I have three and he must have one to say that he must have

938
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,659
one unless he's lying, which I don't know.

939
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,739
Let's find out call it.

940
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,230
All right is no fucking way, right?

941
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,619
If you believe my bid is too high you can call and we and

942
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,719
we check otherwise we keep getting higher and higher.

943
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:16,199
I that means he has to have two fours, which he might I

944
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:16,900
don't buy it though.

945
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,039
One two, three.

946
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:28,769
He what's the what's the chances that he has two fours?

947
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,489
This is squid game.

948
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:38,889
It's not squid stop saying quit squid game call there.

949
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,150
So you did have two fours you piece of shit.

950
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:45,360
All right.

951
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,550
So now I lose a dice and we keep going squid game.

952
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,449
Whatever squid game.

953
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:50,949
I don't care.

954
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,139
All right.

955
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,880
So let's say I'm going to say there are I'm going to say

956
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
I got two twos.

957
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,579
This is absolute horse shit, right?

958
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:00,969
This is a complete and total fabrication.

959
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,170
So he's going to be like, oh this motherfucker has two twos

960
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:05,900
three twos.

961
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,599
Oh you think so you think so call it that he has to have

962
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:10,699
three fucking twos.

963
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:11,300
No way.

964
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:19,230
There it is tied up again.

965
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:28,139
So you're new to our fair city is you how can you tell?

966
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,170
Okay.

967
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,769
So you're saying two threes.

968
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,960
I have one so that means he must have at least one.

969
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,260
Let's go three threes.

970
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,860
Let's just let's just pull it off right here.

971
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:38,559
Three threes.

972
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:40,840
Let's go.

973
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,010
Yeah, fuck it.

974
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,409
Let's go.

975
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:43,780
He's not going to call it.

976
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,659
Oh my God.

977
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,159
What an idiot.

978
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,159
Wait, is he an idiot or does he have three of them?

979
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:57,980
No way call advantage player.

980
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,949
So now he only has three dice.

981
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:02,349
So it becomes harder and harder and harder.

982
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,449
If you've ever seen squid game, apparently it's in squid game.

983
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,750
Apparently I guess.

984
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,119
Okay.

985
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,980
So now so he only has three.

986
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,940
So I have I could just do this right.

987
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,300
I think there are one there are one.

988
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,199
I only have one.

989
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,900
So let's go one for two twos.

990
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,699
So he only has three.

991
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:38,300
He has to have two doesn't I don't I'm calling it.

992
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:43,599
That means he has he has to have two of his three dice have

993
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,599
to be twos.

994
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:53,469
I don't think he has two twos.

995
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:56,239
He would have to have two.

996
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,739
No, it's you can just make it up.

997
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,289
Three twos, but if he calls that then he his bluff worked.

998
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,630
I'm gonna say two fives because I have it and if he calls it

999
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,639
I don't care three twos.

1000
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:18,139
All right.

1001
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,440
No, I'm sorry, dude.

1002
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,139
But this do you think do you guys honestly think he has three

1003
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,340
his whole hand is a two.

1004
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,539
No, fuck you call it.

1005
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:25,539
I win.

1006
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,000
I would have won last time anyways.

1007
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,500
No, I wouldn't have I would have yeah, I would have all right.

1008
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,800
He only has two dice left.

1009
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:39,010
You do reach the North Gate.

1010
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,909
How will you open it?

1011
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:41,309
I don't intend to.

1012
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,119
All right.

1013
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,820
So he's one of his he's saying he has a one.

1014
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,690
Try to just fuck with them here.

1015
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:57,840
Two fours.

1016
00:47:58,699 --> 00:47:59,800
I have two fours.

1017
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,030
All right.

1018
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,360
So he might have a one and a four so I could call them out

1019
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,860
here and do three fours.

1020
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,059
I mean three.

1021
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:07,460
Sorry.

1022
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,039
Yeah.

1023
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:08,340
No, no, no.

1024
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,840
Wait, what?

1025
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,539
Yeah, free whatever, you know what I'm saying?

1026
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:17,139
Because if I if he calls what if he hey might have that I

1027
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:18,840
think he has a three.

1028
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:22,969
He definitely has a three.

1029
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:26,250
Why you're gonna just lose if you don't I'm gonna be three

1030
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:26,650
threes.

1031
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:29,699
All right with this.

1032
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,199
That's physically not possible.

1033
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,920
Like you just lose roll dice one more time.

1034
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,619
He has one dice and I have four.

1035
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,079
Okay, so I get to start.

1036
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:49,480
There are I got one one.

1037
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:50,679
So make it up.

1038
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,780
He's gonna say two ones one two.

1039
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,980
Okay, so you have a two.

1040
00:48:54,519 --> 00:49:03,920
Let's say two twos three twos.

1041
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,670
I will take that free night in the inn by the way seven

1042
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,070
gold.

1043
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,269
I don't got to spend anything.

1044
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,539
Let's go.

1045
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,400
I win.

1046
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,460
Don't I talking to people will provide clues to help your

1047
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:23,860
quest.

1048
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,460
You can review your clues on the inventory screen collect

1049
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,519
your gold from the counter once more and the innkeeper

1050
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,519
reluctantly counts out another seven into your palm.

1051
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:35,840
I was unlucky.

1052
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,739
It happens.

1053
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:38,239
You want another try?

1054
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:40,280
I've played enough.

1055
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,389
I've played enough.

1056
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,320
You tell him happy with your winning streak very well from

1057
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,019
cost seven gold pieces.

1058
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:54,420
And as I said very cool.

1059
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,920
Wait, I could also sleep outside.

1060
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,219
Should I not even spend the money?

1061
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:04,699
I think I'm gonna sleep outside.

1062
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,079
I'll be on my way.

1063
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,929
The innkeeper looks surprised but I thought but you are

1064
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,030
out of the door before he finishes heading to find a

1065
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,570
field to bed down in for free.

1066
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,289
I got 24 gold.

1067
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,579
I got the ape.

1068
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,530
Now the ape the ape hates me.

1069
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:39,530
You strike off into fields and find a muddy Dell in which

1070
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,500
to stretch out the stars are out forming the constellations

1071
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,300
of the ape and you feel a certain piece despite the

1072
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:50,309
hulking shadow of the wall settle to sleep you settle

1073
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:53,380
quickly the sounds of the city drift to you on the night

1074
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,480
air shouts and screams and the occasional distant howl

1075
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,090
distinctly you doze off fitfully turning over in your

1076
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,190
mind that what the innkeeper told you of the four spell

1077
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,630
lines required to open the North Gate didn't pay any

1078
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,329
attention to that.

1079
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,019
I was too busy gambling then halfway through the night

1080
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:14,019
you will wake into the sound of something scratching in

1081
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:18,559
the earth nearby sit up ignore it or draw my sword.

1082
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,150
They're in the rocks.

1083
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,679
You're gonna get robbed.

1084
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,699
I'm gonna sit up you sit up and peer into the darkness

1085
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:35,539
you see red glowing eyes and slavering teeth in the

1086
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:36,039
gloom.

1087
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,679
It's a werewolf but how can that be the moon is only

1088
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:41,280
crescent.

1089
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:58,260
What do we got you deal with it and go back to bed.

1090
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,119
We also got of course law laws expensive, but it's really

1091
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:07,619
helpful.

1092
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:25,440
Shield Raz sharpen blade rock turn to stone and then

1093
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,170
I'm assuming probably hot right how fine safe passage

1094
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,349
safe passage.

1095
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:39,039
That's interesting and this also hot as well.

1096
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,639
No zap.

1097
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:40,440
No one.

1098
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh yeah, there's hot gob.

1099
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,099
All right.

1100
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,300
Let's just let's go for it.

1101
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:48,800
Let's go.

1102
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,699
I have 12 teeth.

1103
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:55,210
Let's go you toss down a tooth and cast your spell

1104
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,510
across it tooth appears to ignite sending up a wisp of

1105
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,010
smoke.

1106
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,309
Which then fattens out into the shape of a goblin

1107
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:05,119
warrior performs a ridiculous salute and then sets to

1108
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,449
attacking the werewolf the fight is tense and close

1109
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,250
and the goblin gets a few good strikes in but one

1110
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,489
strong charge from the werewolf is too much one

1111
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:14,789
moment.

1112
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:16,889
The Beast has the goblin throat between its jaws.

1113
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:22,449
The next the goblin has vanished entirely more you

1114
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,820
throw down a second tooth a second warrior appears

1115
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,019
rattling his sword and shield to try and scare the

1116
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:29,019
werewolf away.

1117
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:33,019
Amazingly it works and the Beast turns tail and runs

1118
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:33,820
off into the dark.

1119
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,780
The little goblin disappears in pursuit and you are

1120
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,579
left alone.

1121
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:43,639
Why would he chase him?

1122
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:45,340
I could have you could have hung we could have hung

1123
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,840
out man.

1124
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:47,510
All right.

1125
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,409
Well back to bed.

1126
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:49,909
I got 10 more teeth.

1127
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:57,420
Your dreams when they come are of the wall like a

1128
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,579
towering monster drenched in moss and slime the gate

1129
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:05,119
it's wide open ma on its back is a host of guards

1130
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,010
chanting a mantra too quietly for you to hear as

1131
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,610
you watch it reaches down with fingers made from

1132
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:14,369
flagpoles and skewers the old beggar man lifting him

1133
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:15,570
flailing into the air.

1134
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,019
Oh my God as you make your way inside guards appear

1135
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:21,119
and disappear from holes in the ground like burrowing

1136
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,619
moles a wolf and shining armor howls at the sun and

1137
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,809
it is there as though you can see the crown sitting

1138
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:31,550
in the dust on the far side of the North Gate so

1139
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,219
close and yet out of reach found a new clue.

1140
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:38,769
What are the clues?

1141
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:50,010
North spell gate the North Gate requires a spell

1142
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,210
made of four lines to be opened without the lines

1143
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,110
you will not be able to leave the city port.

1144
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,099
First noble Sansus knows Lord Sansus is the first

1145
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:03,099
noble of Kare and only he knows the full spell to

1146
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,800
open the North Gate of the city port.

1147
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:14,139
Armored wolves werewolves capped in their lupine

1148
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:16,639
form by magical plate armor are stalking the city

1149
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:17,139
at night.

1150
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,000
We did learn about Vic.

1151
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,159
A man named Vic runs several businesses in the

1152
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:22,760
city port.

1153
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,469
These two know each other.

1154
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,139
Andrigor and Vic were once comrades.

1155
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,039
Turn the music down never.

1156
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,530
Okay next morning.

1157
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,869
Why did what am I saying meow because all the cats

1158
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:41,869
that are meowing in the background.

1159
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:42,469
Can you not hear them?

1160
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:45,769
Do you not hear all the cats?

1161
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,590
Is it too low?

1162
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,679
You guys can hear the horses right now, right?

1163
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:03,829
Yeah, okay.

1164
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,630
So you didn't hear the cats earlier?

1165
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,380
You wake early ready to begin your exploration

1166
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,320
of the city following the track for a few minutes

1167
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,619
you reach a junction where three roads begin.

1168
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,510
These are the outskirts of Kare.

1169
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,179
Huts huddle like beggars on either side of the

1170
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:22,079
tracks leading uphill into the city port.

1171
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,760
Pause to look around.

1172
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,139
It must be clear to everyone around that you are

1173
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:29,440
a stranger in these parts.

1174
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:32,440
The city's inhabitants a multitude of malevolent

1175
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,739
creatures who would kill for the laces of your

1176
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,320
boots turn to watch you as they pass.

1177
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,659
You are sport a figure to be jostled and robbed

1178
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:44,159
and one who will most likely fall prey to the

1179
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,699
strange elaborate system of traps laid across

1180
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,800
Kare by the early settlers to protect themselves

1181
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,500
from one another.

1182
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,940
There are more people here than you've seen in a

1183
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,539
long time.

1184
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,969
You cast an eye across the faces to see if any are

1185
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:01,840
flanker the assassin you met outside Torrapani.

1186
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:06,360
You look left to the left you see a group of scruffy

1187
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,659
youngsters walking up the road with packs on their

1188
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:09,059
back.

1189
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:13,539
Ahead is the main road into the center of Kare its

1190
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:16,650
surface rutted from cartwheels further in the

1191
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,849
distance you see fields.

1192
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,449
This is the route taken by supply wagons to the

1193
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:25,050
docks to the right the track heads towards fields

1194
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:28,610
a hut stands proud a little further on the business

1195
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,619
of this place is confusing but you'll have to simply

1196
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,789
strike out somewhere in this city must be the

1197
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,989
information you need to find the spell lines for

1198
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,789
the North Gate that the innkeeper told you about

1199
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:43,360
just at that moment a cart rolls down the road from

1200
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,860
the right and careens around the corner to take

1201
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,900
the main track ahead on its back are stacked several

1202
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,340
crates one teeters for a moment and falls near

1203
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,840
your feet.

1204
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:56,820
It's lid cracking open look at the crate wave for

1205
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:02,019
the driver to stop or leave it look in the crate

1206
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:06,090
kneeling down in the mud you pry open the crate

1207
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:09,190
with your fingers inside is a pile of smashed

1208
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,260
bottles thick purple liquid swills about littered

1209
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,360
with shards of glass.

1210
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,960
There are perhaps four bottles still intact, but

1211
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,500
you recognize the smell it is splinberry a potion

1212
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,539
with many healing properties take all take two or

1213
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:31,309
leave them take them all all healing is important

1214
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:38,860
take all of them you take all of the bottles wipe

1215
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,360
them down as best you can on the grass nearby and

1216
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,769
put them into your pack a lucky find indeed it also

1217
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:46,769
can be used as a meal.

1218
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:54,000
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for one

1219
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,699
of the most major decisions of the whole game.

1220
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:01,360
This is important as you see we have three choices

1221
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:01,860
ahead of us.

1222
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,820
You understand what's at stake here.

1223
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,460
Do you want to go to the left route this way?

1224
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,119
Do you want to go up this way or do you want to

1225
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,320
go up around here?

1226
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,590
Honestly, I think realistically this probably

1227
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:26,289
leads to here this probably this is probably going

1228
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:29,059
to go like this right.

1229
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,510
This is probably going to go like this maybe in

1230
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,510
whatever in this vicinity and of course this is

1231
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,409
going to go over here.

1232
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,150
This is one of the more major probably decisions

1233
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,349
the whole entire part.

1234
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:47,159
We need to pull where do you want to go left center

1235
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:48,059
or right?

1236
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,309
Look at how big this is.

1237
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,210
This is a major decision.

1238
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,650
I want Squirtle.

1239
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,039
I'll give you a bigger bigger picture so you can

1240
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,940
see up here.

1241
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,449
We've got dwarf town the artist quarter a couple

1242
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:19,349
of towns here a lot of houses.

1243
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:25,389
Whatever this is up here some interesting large

1244
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:29,289
house a few houses to explore whatever this is

1245
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:33,429
this big farm up here something called Mansion

1246
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:38,239
Row right looks to be the Festival of Thieves

1247
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:41,389
Festival of Thieves.

1248
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:47,250
It looks like a carnival going left.

1249
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:54,849
Okay, here we go turn left.

1250
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,739
You follow the children with backpacks up the

1251
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:04,440
road homes hovels line the track and strange

1252
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,840
faces appear at the windows watching you as you

1253
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,079
pass and from around the bend ahead a troop of

1254
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,650
guards appear dart into a hut keep my head low

1255
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,550
blend in with the youngsters or ignore them.

1256
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,349
We need another poll here.

1257
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,980
I'm going to be tapping into you guys a lot more

1258
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:24,940
because a lot of these decisions are branching.

1259
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:31,309
This is no longer the tutorial and this is fun.

1260
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:32,010
I think this is cool.

1261
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:32,710
I like doing it.

1262
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:33,309
It's fun to do.

1263
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:38,059
So what and you know, whoever is doing the polls

1264
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:40,260
would have a mod is probably simple just to

1265
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:44,010
sometimes just do like 1 2 3 or 4 that makes it

1266
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,710
probably a lot easier to like type everything out

1267
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,940
literally, you know, just 1 2 3 4 you guys can

1268
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,059
count right Twitch plays sorcery will not every

1269
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:54,460
decision.

1270
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,960
I'm obviously I've made half of them already.

1271
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:02,349
So and stuff like this we can end in like 20 to

1272
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:02,949
30 seconds.

1273
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,440
You're overestimating us.

1274
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,590
Hello fellow kids.

1275
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:20,909
Well, that would be option 3 there's dart into a

1276
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:26,300
hut keep your head low or just ignore them think

1277
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,000
about what we've been doing so far.

1278
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,730
What why would we be running from the guards,

1279
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,030
right?

1280
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,429
Do we need to run from the guards?

1281
01:02:35,429 --> 01:02:37,730
Do we have to why would we be like, oh shit?

1282
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:38,329
What have you done?

1283
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:39,630
What laws have we broken so far?

1284
01:02:42,219 --> 01:02:43,420
We might run into somebody here.

1285
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,519
This is this is a nearby hut.

1286
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,420
This is not our property.

1287
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,650
Keep head low whatever who are these youngsters

1288
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,739
you impersonated an official and they don't know

1289
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:56,139
that yet.

1290
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:57,019
Oh fuck.

1291
01:02:57,019 --> 01:02:57,519
Maybe they do.

1292
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,019
It's true.

1293
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:00,849
All right, we're going to go blend in with the

1294
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:01,449
youngsters.

1295
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:04,889
You stride quickly forward to join the group of

1296
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,789
youngsters and attempt to mimic their way of

1297
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:07,389
walking.

1298
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,710
The group are talking about where they will stay

1299
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:14,670
the wayfarers rest or the meat and cleaver.

1300
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,340
I think the meat and cleaver is the best place.

1301
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,070
Listen to our what I don't listen.

1302
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:22,769
Don't speak.

1303
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,500
Why would I suggest something that's weird?

1304
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,599
That's actually that's weird.

1305
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:31,809
I mean if somebody was walking around, I don't

1306
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:32,610
know right.

1307
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,920
I don't I wouldn't do that.

1308
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,820
I don't maybe I would if it was like in a different

1309
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,090
I don't know what kind of setting you'd be in if

1310
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,590
somebody was walking around and they were like,

1311
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,059
oh gosh, I just don't know where to eat.

1312
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,559
I've I've missed my first time in Vegas hash house

1313
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,199
ago go at the link, which it looks okay.

1314
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,900
I haven't heard much about it or or Dave's pizza.

1315
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,440
I'm not sure.

1316
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:02,039
I mean would I be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1317
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:04,500
I'm telling you tell you what hash house at Lake

1318
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:04,699
man.

1319
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:05,300
It's gonna be good.

1320
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,260
I don't think I would do that.

1321
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,559
I would probably just be like, yeah, I'll just

1322
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,559
leave people alone.

1323
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:15,409
What should I do?

1324
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:18,710
All right, run another poll one two or three

1325
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:20,510
because I don't I actually don't know what

1326
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:21,409
happens with these.

1327
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,500
I'm not going to be responsible for this.

1328
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:31,389
Where should we stay?

1329
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:33,590
Where should we suggest that they stay?

1330
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,699
I wouldn't say anything or you could also do

1331
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:43,039
the thing to where it's like, okay, so oh,

1332
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,639

01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,179

Oh, yeah.

01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:57,989
Hey, hey, what's up?

1339
01:04:57,989 --> 01:04:58,690
Hey, what's up, Joe?

1340
01:04:59,170 --> 01:04:59,469
Yeah.

1341
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:00,070
Yeah, I'm here.

1342
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:00,869
You got you coming.

1343
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:01,570
You guys coming?

1344
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,159
Yeah, cool.

1345
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:03,559
Yep.

1346
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:05,059
Where were you ever meeting up at the hash house

1347
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:05,760
ago go, right?

1348
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,059
Oh, yeah, it's my favorite restaurant.

1349
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,730
Yeah, that's probably the best restaurant

1350
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,030
and that's probably my one of my favorite

1351
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,030
restaurants in Las Vegas.

1352
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:11,869
Yeah.

1353
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:12,170
Yeah, dude.

1354
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:12,869
I'll see you there.

1355
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:13,469
Right.

1356
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:17,760
Do that.

1357
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:19,730
No, not with my fingers.

1358
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,530
I'm not like holding up my fingers with

1359
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,630
the gag with a cell phone.

1360
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:27,300
Listen, don't speak.

1361
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,449
All right, you keep your weary face down

1362
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:32,449
and you must have the right slump to your

1363
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:35,119
shoulders as the guards pass straight by

1364
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,019
with nothing more than a derogatory comment.

1365
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,599
A pleasant herbal smell drifts from the

1366
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:42,000
doorway of a nearby hut.

1367
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:46,960
Should I go in the hut?

1368
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:48,389
I'm going in.

1369
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:49,090
I'm going in.

1370
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,690
Let's go.

1371
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:50,690
We're going in this hut.

1372
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:54,670
I'm going in.

1373
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,019
Inside is dark with a smell of rotting straw

1374
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,619
rising from pile of mattresses that circle

1375
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:03,219
a low table.

1376
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,659
It is only after a moment that you notice

1377
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:07,360
these mattresses are occupied.

1378
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,710
Three ugly faces peer at you through clouds

1379
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,210
of smoke rising from a hookah pipe that

1380
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,309
sits on the table.

1381
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,960
Examine the people smell the air.

1382
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,360
I should walk in and just go.

1383
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,469
Oh, that's good.

1384
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,570
What the fuck?

1385
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,300
Why are you so rude?

1386
01:06:35,139 --> 01:06:36,340
Smell the air.

1387
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:38,039
All right.

1388
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:38,739
I need a pole.

1389
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,340
Are we?

1390
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:41,039
Well, I mean, I think we could probably

1391
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:43,380
just in case this option goes away.

1392
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,400
One, two or three.

1393
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:47,820
Do I even need to run the pole?

1394
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,519
It's right.

1395
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:49,659
Maybe not.

1396
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,730
I mean, it's it's going to be by a long

1397
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:52,929
shot.

1398
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,130
It's going to be two, right?

1399
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,130
It is just it is.

1400
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,230
I already know it.

1401
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,570
Smell the air.

1402
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,449
You sniff the air tentatively and your

1403
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:02,550
head spins.

1404
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,030
The smoke of the hookah is sweet and

1405
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,230
stupefying.

1406
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:07,829
It is weed plant.

1407
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:12,809
Sit and draw on the hookah.

1408
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:16,929
I mean, you just sit here and smoke weed.

1409
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,179
This is the this is that gas station

1410
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:24,380
weed we were talking about.

1411
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:29,650
This is not gas station weed.

1412
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,250
This is like a hookah place.

1413
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,010
I'm going to sit and draw on the hookah.

1414
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,409
Fuck it.

1415
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:39,280
Whatever you gesture to the nearest

1416
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,880
elf asking for permission to sit down

1417
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,480
beside him.

1418
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,510
He does not even notice you putting the

1419
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,710
pipe to your mouth.

1420
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,949
You breathe in a cloud of sweet apple

1421
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:49,949
tasting smoke.

1422
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:52,719
You begin to feel lightheaded weed plant

1423
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,320
affects different people in different ways

1424
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:56,320
and you cannot be sure what it will do

1425
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:56,820
to you.

1426
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,239
As you wait to find out,

1427
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:01,539
you find yourself staring up into

1428
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:02,539
the clouds.

1429
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,400
Shapes seem to form themselves.

1430
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:06,610
There.

1431
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,340
Is it a dragon or a milk jug?

1432
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:17,869
That's a milk jug.

1433
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:20,739
If I've ever seen one before.

1434
01:08:21,789 --> 01:08:24,390
Milk jug over brimming at its lip

1435
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:26,989
carried by an old man smoking a pipe

1436
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,289
or is that a young girl dancing

1437
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:33,390
in a wide billowing dress?

1438
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,369
Oh, it's an old man, of course.

1439
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:41,130
It's just smoke.

1440
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,739
Oh, come on fleek.

1441
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:46,140
It's just smoke.

1442
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:49,569
A girl or old man?

1443
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:52,750
I don't know.

1444
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,050
This is this seems pretty divided.

1445
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,649
This is an old man.

1446
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:01,949
An old man.

1447
01:09:01,949 --> 01:09:02,550
Yes.

1448
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,850
Your father perhaps before he passed on

1449
01:09:05,539 --> 01:09:06,939
smoking a pipe himself

1450
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,939
and telling you to train harder

1451
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,640
to be cautious to eat well.

1452
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,979
He never followed a word of his own advice

1453
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,979
and now he is no longer around to

1454
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:15,579
hand it out.

1455
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,600
The effect of the smoke is pleasant

1456
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,699
and relaxing like a long hot bath

1457
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:20,399
or a good rest.

1458
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,739
You feel yourself regaining some strength.

1459
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,939
You turn to the nearest elf and nod.

1460
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,600
It's really good to meet you.

1461
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,600
You say the elf nods back in return.

1462
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,750
Is it your hut?

1463
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,949
I want to buy it.

1464
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,340
I don't have enough.

1465
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,340
I have 24 gold.

1466
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,939
I don't have like a thousand gold.

1467
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:42,369
Is this your hut?

1468
01:09:42,369 --> 01:09:43,270
I want to buy it.

1469
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,720
Yeah, I haven't even said anything.

1470
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,680
It's good to meet you.

1471
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:52,380
Oh, yeah.

1472
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:53,880
I want to buy this place.

1473
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,079
I feel like you they're going to like

1474
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:57,680
kick the shit out of me, right?

1475
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,710
Like I want to ask you for help

1476
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,409
or I'm new to Kari.

1477
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:05,810
I only have 24 gold.

1478
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,210
How am I?

1479
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,579
Yeah, don't say that.

1480
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:15,800
All right.

1481
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,239
Maybe the hub.

1482
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:17,939
Maybe it's cheap.

1483
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:18,539
I don't know.

1484
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:25,020
Why is this your hut?

1485
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:26,119
I want to buy it.

1486
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,420
The elf nods deeply in reply.

1487
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,670
I've been sent by the first noble.

1488
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,869
I hear the North Gate is locked with a spell.

1489
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,760
You have anything to eat here?

1490
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:46,949
This is too obvious.

1491
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:50,289
You have anything to eat here?

1492
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:50,590
Maybe.

1493
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:51,689
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need to eat.

1494
01:10:53,979 --> 01:10:55,579
Do you have anything to eat here?

1495
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:59,039
The elf nods a third time more profoundly now.

1496
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:02,579
I feel like I know you already.

1497
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:04,800
I'm an ordinary trader.

1498
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,899
I'm on a vital mission.

1499
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:07,500
I feel like I know you already.

1500
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
Talk to one of the others.

1501
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:12,340
I think this guy's too high, right?

1502
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,380
I think we have to go somewhere else.

1503
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:18,409
He's just nodding.

1504
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,800
I feel like I know you already.

1505
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,260
The elf nods once more.

1506
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,859
It is only then that you realize that he is asleep.

1507
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:32,449
This is useless.

1508
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:34,930
The smokers are too confused and vague.

1509
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:37,029
This is why I should have went to somebody else.

1510
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:38,470
Try something else.

1511
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,260
Enough talking.

1512
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:42,060
You look around the hut once more.

1513
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,500
One of the elves takes a long draw on the hookah pipe

1514
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,600
then sighs and settles back on his mattress.

1515
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:53,739
You look at the three creatures who are staring at you with lazy disinterest.

1516
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:55,479
They are the black elves.

1517
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:58,979
Normally dangerous, but now they seem like they could barely stand.

1518
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,430
Leave this place.

1519
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:03,680
The atmosphere is putrid.

1520
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,569
You go straight back into the fresh air and then continue up the street.

1521
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,399
Okay.

1522
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:12,750
Why couldn't I talk to anybody?

1523
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,039
That's stupid.

1524
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:20,710
Wait, what if I just wait till everybody's like sober?

1525
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:29,510
All right, there's only one way to go.

1526
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:32,680
Imagine talking to smokers.

1527
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:39,029
There's only one way to go.

1528
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,039
You continue up the narrow road.

1529
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,739
It is packed either side with mud brick hovels.

1530
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:47,939
But most are deserted.

1531
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:50,539
A few creatures pass by, heads turned down.

1532
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:51,739
They do not look at you.

1533
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,100
This part of the city port is barely inhabited.

1534
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,079
So you're unlikely to find clues to the North Gate spell here.

1535
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,960
There'll be more people to talk to near the docks.

1536
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,060
You pass a drinking fountain,

1537
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:05,659
dribbling water into a chipped stone bowl.

1538
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:07,579
Excuse me.

1539
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,659
Drink from the fountain.

1540
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,859
This is like the worst idea.

1541
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:16,359
Let's get a poll.

1542
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:18,720
Go back and smoke more weed.

1543
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:29,579
Let's go for it.

1544
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:31,220
One, two, or three.

1545
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,319
Stop a creature, drink from the fountain, or just keep going.

1546
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:40,130
We need to test your immune system.

1547
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,350
By drinking out of a fountain?

1548
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,350
I mean, it's probably just a regular fountain.

1549
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,539
Or could it be not?

1550
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,439
Maybe it's something else.

1551
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:51,109
Should I stop somebody?

1552
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,409
Like, hey, excuse me.

1553
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,010
Do you know the spell?

1554
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:55,010
The door spell?

1555
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,479
All right, what do we got?

1556
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,819
The hookah was probably worse than the fountain.

1557
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:14,069
I got healed from the hookah.

1558
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:15,369
That was a good thing.

1559
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,520
The real RP mode is to drink because of the weed cotton mouth.

1560
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:31,239
All right, what do we got?

1561
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,350
Two, drink from the fountain.

1562
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,369
You lean down by the fountain and cup your hand to drink.

1563
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:40,270
The water tastes cool, if herbal.

1564
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:42,600
Perhaps something is growing in it.

1565
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,050
Good choice.

1566
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:52,050
Oh, now all of a sudden chat, everyone's going to say spit it out.

1567
01:14:52,449 --> 01:14:53,550
Oh, spit it out, spit it out.

1568
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:54,649
Never mind, never mind, never mind.

1569
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:59,149
Or how many of the, like, drink giga chads do we have here that don't care?

1570
01:14:59,619 --> 01:15:00,220
Let's find out.

1571
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,140
Run another poll, please.

1572
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,180
This one can be quick.

1573
01:15:11,659 --> 01:15:12,760
This is a free drink.

1574
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:15,090
Go in for a second.

1575
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,829
We must commit to the bit.

1576
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:22,630
It's bong water.

1577
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:31,989
I don't know.

1578
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,609
It said it was herbal.

1579
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:37,119
It says something's growing in it.

1580
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:38,880
I'm sorry.

1581
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:51,180
If I lean down and I drink out of a fountain and I see a bunch of, like, green mold all over the spout and all over where I drank out of it, and I've cut my hands down and drank it and there's like mold in my hands, I'm going to spit it out.

1582
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:55,779
You swallow boldly.

1583
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:59,680
If the fountain is still running on a busy street like this, it can't be too poisonous.

1584
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,430
In fact, the water seems quite fresh.

1585
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:07,000
And you swallow a few more mouthfuls, finding you would not realize how thirsty you were.

1586
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,810
All right.

1587
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,390
Okay.

1588
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:16,989
I'm stopping somebody.

1589
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:20,180
You stop a stooped orc-like creature.

1590
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,340
I...

1591
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:24,239
Hey, you.

1592
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,350
Yes?

1593
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:27,039
I'm new to Kari.

1594
01:16:27,579 --> 01:16:28,079
Okay.

1595
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:29,380
Fucking leave me alone.

1596
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:30,479
Why would you do this?

1597
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,869
I'm heading for the North Gate?

1598
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
I'm heading for the North Gate.

1599
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:37,720
I'm heading for the North Gate.

1600
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:40,699
The North Gate?

1601
01:16:41,619 --> 01:16:43,020
I heard about that once.

1602
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:44,640
What did you hear?

1603
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:47,140
Oh, I don't know.

1604
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:49,539
I think maybe they took it down.

1605
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,010
But then I've never been able to afford to cross the river.

1606
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,649
Is it expensive?

1607
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:57,630
I don't know.

1608
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,439
It's all relative.

1609
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:00,539
Excuse me.

1610
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:01,640
I have to be going.

1611
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:03,590
With that, he shuffles away.

1612
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:04,590
There's nothing else to do here.

1613
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,590
You continue up the road.

1614
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,069
So it's expensive to cross the river.

1615
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:15,079
The corner of a wall.

1616
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:21,060
This part of town feels abandoned.

1617
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:25,060
Like the drying strip of sand left behind by a falling tide.

1618
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:27,779
A little further on.

1619
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:28,180
Hold on.

1620
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:28,479
Sorry.

1621
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,239
I'm still getting over this cough.

1622
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,800
A little further on.

1623
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,229
The road approaches the first stone building you have seen since the hut by the gates.

1624
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,859
It has windows of glass and a wide yard inside its uneven high wall.

1625
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,829
Whoever lives here is wealthy and understandably cautious.

1626
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:50,760
They have, however, left a fine stallion only loosely tied up outside.

1627
01:17:56,869 --> 01:17:58,069
Do we go to the horse?

1628
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:00,170
Go to the house or just keep going on the road.

1629
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:07,420
Steal the horse and run.

1630
01:18:10,029 --> 01:18:12,729
All right, we're going to call this one, two, three.

1631
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:15,659
Okay, one, two, three.

1632
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:17,720
See the pole.

1633
01:18:18,329 --> 01:18:19,430
Do I even need to run the pole?

1634
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:22,720
Do we need anybody to do that?

1635
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:26,699
You wouldn't download a horse.

1636
01:18:44,369 --> 01:18:46,170
Out of the way that you can predict all the outcomes.

1637
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:49,170
Well, because when I look over the chat and I see in all capitals

1638
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:55,300
horse by five to six hundred different people.

1639
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,340
I mean, I know you'd only a thousand two thousand people vote on the pole.

1640
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,289
It's going to win.

1641
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:04,939
All right, let's go.

1642
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:09,090
Okay.

1643
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:09,689
Okay.

1644
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:10,189
Okay.

1645
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,479
The horse is free.

1646
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,640
Well, we don't know that you approach the horse.

1647
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,840
It snorts nervously wary of your presence.

1648
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:27,880
You might be able to claim it calm it or even talk to it with the correct spell.

1649
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,779
Oh, come on.

1650
01:19:28,779 --> 01:19:29,979
We can't talk to the horse.

1651
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:36,960
Wait, hold on.

1652
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,020
We need a green wig.

1653
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,420
We didn't.

1654
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,020
We never got a green wig anywhere.

1655
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,460
We could have talked to the horse.

1656
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,760
We could make ourselves invisible.

1657
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:57,930
Sus could sense danger.

1658
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:00,670
We could finally cast sus for the first time.

1659
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,239
It's not a bad spell to do in a lot of scenarios.

1660
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:14,649
There's also sap is also.

1661
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,350
Oh God.

1662
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:21,220
Uh, why?

1663
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,819
Why would you do that?

1664
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,750
Why would you do that?

1665
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:28,899
Just throw a fireball at the horse for what?

1666
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,300
It's going to cause a huge problem.

1667
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:37,060
Uh, we have yeah, okay.

1668
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:37,960
So there's your options.

1669
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:39,689
We don't have to cat.

1670
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:41,390
We don't have to cast a spell, right?

1671
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:42,289
We don't have to do that.

1672
01:20:45,689 --> 01:20:47,689
We could do sus sus is not a bad one to do.

1673
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:48,989
I'm going to cast us.

1674
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:49,590
Here we go.

1675
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:56,239
You cast the spell and a calm voice enters your mind.

1676
01:20:56,739 --> 01:21:00,840
It tells you that the horse is a strong powerful and willful beast

1677
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:07,239
and one unlikely to be tamed but it is not cruel and does not wish you harm

1678
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:10,399
and the voice fades talk to the horse.

1679
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,310
Should I talk to the horse?

1680
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,720
You try a few words in the common tongue and then a few whispered in the more

1681
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,420
gentle language of your boyhood in Chawberry wood.

1682
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:32,989
The animal listens with its ears cocked giving you a strange distant look.

1683
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,229
What of course it does.

1684
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:38,779
It's a horse still it appears calmer in your presence.

1685
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:49,600
Now, perhaps you've made a friend keeping your eyes fixed on the beasts.

1686
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,899
You slip the reins from around the hitching post and hold them firmly

1687
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:58,770
and in one movement you pull sharply bringing it round so you can jump onto

1688
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:02,399
its back the horse friendly or not is having none of it.

1689
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:07,140
It winnie's loudly and rears up in the air and then with you barely settled on

1690
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,640
its back.

1691
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:13,880
It bolts at terrific speed along the road heading back the way you came for

1692
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,380
our stuff.

1693
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,079
Hold on for dear life or jump free.

1694
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,810
Hold on for dear life.

1695
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,350
Hit the Yankee splinky now.

1696
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,149
We hold now.

1697
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:31,239
We hold use a spell.

1698
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:32,939
This is what happens when you try to steal a horse.

1699
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,359
Okay, I'm going to.

1700
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,859
I'm going to have to do a poll.

1701
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:39,560
Look at all the holds hold on for dear life.

1702
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,220
You cling on as best you can trying to calm the beast as it stampede along

1703
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,520
the outer streets of Kare.

1704
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:50,689
You plunge madly through a market past a shrine and down a wide ruined

1705
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:54,859
Street just as you think you're doomed to crash into a building something

1706
01:22:54,859 --> 01:22:57,960
makes the horse startle and it leaps throwing you to the ground.

1707
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:04,750
You land awkwardly the horse winnie's and races away.

1708
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,989
Where the fuck are we?

1709
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,180
Oh my God.

1710
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:17,310
You pick yourself up off the ground.

1711
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:21,939
You are on a wide road that winds along the edge of a cliff.

1712
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,050
You're lucky not have been thrown over it.

1713
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:28,010
The road passes through the ruin of a grand building.

1714
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:32,079
It would must have gone what must have been a glorious morning room.

1715
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:36,380
An ornamental pond is all that remains moss grows from the cracks

1716
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,880
in its tiled sides.

1717
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:41,869
Okay, so where did we?

1718
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:43,680
All right.

1719
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:50,909
So should we rewind here or do I get three rewinds per part?

1720
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:59,340
What we seem to have done is we were going down this route, which would

1721
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,039
have led us probably somewhere over here.

1722
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:09,140
This route would have probably ended up here or here and then up this

1723
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,720
way with though.

1724
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:11,319
Okay.

1725
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:13,619
So we may have been able to get here by going this way.

1726
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,920
You can only rewind if you fireball the horse.

1727
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:29,569
We could roll with it too.

1728
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,569
No, I don't want to do that.

1729
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:39,159
No, no, no, no.

1730
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,760
I was reading what somebody said on chat.

1731
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,960
I don't want to actually do that.

1732
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:42,560
It's horrible.

1733
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:45,579
All right.

1734
01:24:45,579 --> 01:24:46,380
That's funny.

1735
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:46,880
And that's funny.

1736
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,880
I mean, I'm going to rewind.

1737
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,079
I'm going to use one rewind here.

1738
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:56,170
I'm going to go back to the horse or okay.

1739
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:57,470
Do I go back to the horse?

1740
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:00,569
Or do I go back to the choice of or the horse?

1741
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,319
You should just roll with it.

1742
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:08,739
All right.

1743
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,140
I have a choice here.

1744
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:10,640
I could make.

1745
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:14,210
I'm going to go before the horse.

1746
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:15,880
Yep.

1747
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:16,779
That's my decision.

1748
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,579
One rewind is gone.

1749
01:25:18,579 --> 01:25:19,380
We have only two more.

1750
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,180
So I have to be careful.

1751
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:23,010
I'm going back.

1752
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:28,050
So here we are again with the horse.

1753
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:33,149
I think I'm going to go into the house.

1754
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,560
I don't want to fireball the horse.

1755
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:39,739
That's three stamina.

1756
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:47,609
Do I have to fireball the horse?

1757
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,710
Or are you guys going to not, you guys are going to, that's rude.

1758
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:54,079
It's an evil horse.

1759
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,079
No.

1760
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:59,680
When I cast sus, it said this horse was very kind and was not going to cause me any harm.

1761
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:03,609
No, I'm not going to haunt the horse.

1762
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:04,310
I'm going to the house.

1763
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,310
You step through the gate of the house into its wide front yard.

1764
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:16,819
It was once a magnificent, magnificent place with fish ponds now stagnant.

1765
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:24,500
Fountains now cracked and dry and small groups of quiet trees now overgrown and gnarled like whispering old men.

1766
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,020
The building itself has fared no better.

1767
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:33,260
One side has collapsed in on itself completely and the other leans perilously to one side.

1768
01:26:34,609 --> 01:26:35,109
Oh dear.

1769
01:26:35,409 --> 01:26:35,609
All right.

1770
01:26:35,609 --> 01:26:36,510
Look at the trees.

1771
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:39,710
Approach the building or look at the fountains.

1772
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:57,510
Oh, don't resident sleeper because I didn't throw a fireball at a fucking horse.

1773
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,619
I don't want to kill a horse.

1774
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:09,369
Okay, you understand if I fireball the horse and mayhem breaks out in the streets and I have to fight 10 people and I'm going to have to rewind again.

1775
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:12,569
I, I, I don't want to throw a fireball at a horse in the street.

1776
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,329
I'm going to have to kill like I'm going to have to kill like three people.

1777
01:27:16,329 --> 01:27:17,630
You understand that I'm going to get attacked.

1778
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:18,930
The guards are going to chase me.

1779
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:20,710
I only have three.

1780
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,310
We I only have three rewinds.

1781
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,409
I can't say rewind.

1782
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:29,220
Hey, by the way, sorcery is currently on most platforms.

1783
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,119
You can get it on Xbox.

1784
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:31,319
You can get it on Steam.

1785
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:33,479
Choose your adventure.

1786
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:39,380
Maybe you'll throw a fireball at an innocent horse just sitting there on the side of the road and cause mayhem.

1787
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:41,239
I want to go to the house.

1788
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,560
All right, let's go look at the trees.

1789
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:54,810
You pause to look around in the trees and shrubs and that's when you notice the two gleaming eyes staring back at you.

1790
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:59,149
A giant bat hangs upside down from one of the branches watching you.

1791
01:27:59,149 --> 01:27:59,850
God damn it.

1792
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:10,520
Mud.

1793
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:14,119
I got rid of my quicksand at the, uh, the manticore.

1794
01:28:17,779 --> 01:28:18,479
Slowness.

1795
01:28:21,949 --> 01:28:22,550
Dud.

1796
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:24,149
Illusion of treasure.

1797
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:25,750
Why would a fake treasure make a bat?

1798
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:27,949
Unless, unless it's not a bat.

1799
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:28,750
Is it like a vampire?

1800
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,550
Gack is fear.

1801
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,210
God is illusion of worship.

1802
01:28:38,609 --> 01:28:39,810
Oh, I can pretend to be a god.

1803
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,319
Is there a goblin?

1804
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:44,119
Nope, enough of this.

1805
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:50,420
Um, we could go for a dumb.

1806
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,520
Clumsiness.

1807
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,720
That's a lot of stamina.

1808
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:53,819
Dud.

1809
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:01,859
That's a lot.

1810
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,159
Clumsiness.

1811
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,659
I'm going to go, I'm going to do it.

1812
01:29:04,659 --> 01:29:05,159
Let's do dumb.

1813
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:13,100
You cast a spell over the bat hoping to make it confused and clumsy, but the spell causes enemies to drop their

1814
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,100
weapons and the bat is not carrying anything.

1815
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,100
So it comes at you quite unaffected.

1816
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:17,600
Fuck.

1817
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:18,199
What?

1818
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,800
What are you talking about?

1819
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,039
I thought it made him stupid.

1820
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:26,649
Wait, where's, where's the spell book?

1821
01:29:26,649 --> 01:29:27,850
What does it say in the spell book?

1822
01:29:28,689 --> 01:29:29,189
What?

1823
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:30,720
Dumb.

1824
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,199
When cast at a creature holding an object such as a weapon, the spell will make the creature clumsy and uncoordinated.

1825
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:38,399
It will drop the object.

1826
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,300
What?

1827
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:44,510
Oh, dim is stupid.

1828
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,010
Oh, come on.

1829
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:49,810
I, I have to, I, I, that's a, I can't waste a rewind.

1830
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:51,210
I can't, that's two rewinds.

1831
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:52,010
No, I can't do that.

1832
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:53,619
Dim.

1833
01:29:55,539 --> 01:29:59,539
To muddle its mind, it must be handled with caution as a deranged creature may act unpredictably.

1834
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:00,239
God damn it.

1835
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:01,640
I don't, I can't rewind.

1836
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That would be two rewinds and I only have three.

1837
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,399
Look, look at my stamina.

1838
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:08,600
This thing's dead.

1839
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:11,909
It's just a bat.

1840
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,699
That's great wings buffet at your face.

1841
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:18,659
All right, just, I can kill this thing easily.

1842
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:20,659
I'm so much more powerful.

1843
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:21,159
It's fine.

1844
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,960
We're going to get full blast.

1845
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,039
Got it, easy.

1846
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:26,739
That's it.

1847
01:30:26,739 --> 01:30:27,239
That's how you do it.

1848
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:27,739
That's fine.

1849
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:31,029
Creature is now afraid.

1850
01:30:31,029 --> 01:30:34,029
Swinging up from a low crouch, you aim for the beast's heart.

1851
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,619
The bat falls to the ground and the light in its eyes goes dark.

1852
01:30:38,609 --> 01:30:39,909
You turn to face the house once more.

1853
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:43,689
Okay.

1854
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,789
Well, we can't go over to the, this now.

1855
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:47,350
Approach the house.

1856
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:54,859
The front door is as wide as two men and stands imposingly sealed.

1857
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,800
A small path winds around the back of the house.

1858
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:04,340
Go to the front door or go to the path at the back.

1859
01:31:07,659 --> 01:31:09,960
It's time for you to decide.

1860
01:31:11,659 --> 01:31:12,760
What do you want to do?

1861
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:16,560
The front door could be trapped.

1862
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,279
Could be hard to open, but maybe more direct.

1863
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:25,850
Or the path leading us around the other side.

1864
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,750
Maybe a back door or a window.

1865
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:34,119
Which way would you like to go?

1866
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,380
This is the exit here.

1867
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,779
So this is the main junction.

1868
01:31:40,779 --> 01:31:42,180
This goes back uphill out here.

1869
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:44,670
So this will pull us this way.

1870
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:45,270
This will pull us.

1871
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,270
Ooh, wait, this will go this way.

1872
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:48,739
Potentially too.

1873
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:57,279
Ooh, okay, interesting.

1874
01:32:00,289 --> 01:32:00,689
Wait, what?

1875
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:02,130
Hold on, this is important.

1876
01:32:04,909 --> 01:32:06,609
There's no VOD for this stream.

1877
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,199
Disable automatic VOD taking.

1878
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:15,500
No, I didn't, I didn't do that.

1879
01:32:18,989 --> 01:32:20,390
Is there no VOD for this stream right now?

1880
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,289
Hold on, let me check that.

1881
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:23,689
Because I didn't, I didn't turn it off.

1882
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,750
There isn't a VOD for this stream.

1883
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,050
Why?

1884
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,319
What the hell?

1885
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:33,220
What are they talking about?

1886
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:37,550
Hold on.

1887
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:42,560
Is there a copy?

1888
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,859
No, they wouldn't, that wouldn't be.

1889
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,699
It got set to private?

1890
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:48,159
Limited edition content.

1891
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:49,359
The lost episode here.

1892
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,039
Wait, people, other people have had this problem?

1893
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,739
You just have to manually publish it after the stream.

1894
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,250
What?

1895
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:01,010
Why would they change that?

1896
01:33:01,899 --> 01:33:02,399
Are you kidding?

1897
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,300
Hold on.

1898
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:08,789
VOD settings.

1899
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,760
Store, pass broadcast.

1900
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:13,260
Always publish VODs.

1901
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,060
VODs will be published by, yeah, turn that on.

1902
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:15,859
Excuse me.

1903
01:33:19,699 --> 01:33:20,500
Why was that off?

1904
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:21,699
It was off automatically.

1905
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:22,100
That's new.

1906
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,899
That's new as of literally today or yesterday.

1907
01:33:25,819 --> 01:33:26,619
I just turned it on.

1908
01:33:26,619 --> 01:33:28,619
Can we check and make sure that it's here?

1909
01:33:31,909 --> 01:33:32,609
I just turned it on.

1910
01:33:36,189 --> 01:33:39,619
Why disable that by default for a new feature?

1911
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:46,859
Hopefully this is actually still here later.

1912
01:33:47,529 --> 01:33:48,430
But I'm sorry about that.

1913
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,729
I did not know that was even a change.

1914
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,939
Well, okay.

1915
01:33:52,939 --> 01:33:53,539
I turned it on.

1916
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:57,640
You don't see it yet, but it might, maybe I can do it afterwards.

1917
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:04,340
Okay.

1918
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,640
Well, I'm really sorry about that because this is kind of annoying.

1919
01:34:09,989 --> 01:34:11,189
God, I just sound so annoyed.

1920
01:34:12,789 --> 01:34:13,489
I turned it on.

1921
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:18,680
All right.

1922
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,180
What did you do?

1923
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:19,680
Was there a pole?

1924
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,579
I didn't see.

1925
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,489
Uh, go off the horse.

1926
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:29,170
All right.

1927
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,970
Well, did we pick the door or do we pick the path?

1928
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:40,729
It was, it was a path.

1929
01:34:40,729 --> 01:34:41,130
I don't remember.

1930
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:41,729
Did we even do one?

1931
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:44,149
It was a door.

1932
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,689
I survived the meat grinder incident.

1933
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,069
There was no meat grinder incident.

1934
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:54,470
You made it up.

1935
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:55,770
Stop making things up.

1936
01:34:55,869 --> 01:34:57,170
Stop making things up about me.

1937
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,369
Stop making things up about me.

1938
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,970
I'm sick of it.

1939
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:00,270
Stop making things up about me.

1940
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:05,779
All right.

1941
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:06,380
Here we go.

1942
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:08,960
Door or path.

1943
01:35:09,529 --> 01:35:11,630
Door is winning by a shitload.

1944
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,170
We're going that way.

1945
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:13,970
Door.

1946
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,779
You stride up the steps to the door of the grand house.

1947
01:35:19,939 --> 01:35:20,340
What can we do?

1948
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:29,819
Sus comes in handy a lot.

1949
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:30,520
Sense danger.

1950
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:31,420
Is the door trapped?

1951
01:35:32,619 --> 01:35:33,720
I can't zap the door though.

1952
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,920
It looks like it wanted me to be able to at some point.

1953
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,220
Hot the door.

1954
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:39,520
How the door is.

1955
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:41,119
Save passage.

1956
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,560
Dop will just open it.

1957
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,500
Although I could hold on.

1958
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:50,670
Just try to open the door.

1959
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:53,250
But what if there's a home alone scenario?

1960
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:57,279
And I Joe Pesci go grab it and I burn my hand, right?

1961
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:01,119
Is it trapped?

1962
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,720
I don't know.

1963
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,319
It might be.

1964
01:36:18,729 --> 01:36:19,229
Sus.

1965
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:25,050
Cast a spell on a calm collected voice tells you that inside the

1966
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:29,550
house is nothing but death, despair, and destruction.

1967
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,229
The voice having delivered its warning fades away.

1968
01:36:35,649 --> 01:36:36,750
We still going in here?

1969
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:39,199
Now what?

1970
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:42,649
Giga Chad.

1971
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,250
Enter.

1972
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:48,550
That seems pretty sus to me.

1973
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:52,449
I'm just going to open it.

1974
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:53,050
Try the door.

1975
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,850
You try the door locked, of course.

1976
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:59,149
A slate skitters off the roof and smashes itself on the

1977
01:36:59,149 --> 01:37:00,550
ground to one side of you.

1978
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:03,039
Wait, what?

1979
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,119
Well, I can just break the door down.

1980
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,890
That was just for me touching the door.

1981
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:13,140
Break down the door.

1982
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,439
Does this hurt?

1983
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:18,939
Just blast the house.

1984
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:38,600
That's too I'm going to be at 13 health.

1985
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:41,300
If I do this, I'm going to burn the house down.

1986
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:43,199
We're going to have gone in it.

1987
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,510
Find safe path.

1988
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:52,029
I'm going to do how you cast a spell and you feel your mind

1989
01:37:52,029 --> 01:37:55,130
reaching out exploring possible paths and meandering avenues.

1990
01:37:55,909 --> 01:37:59,909
Strangely, the spell seems to ignore the house entirely.

1991
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:04,199
In fact, it reaches towards a road heading off on the left.

1992
01:38:06,659 --> 01:38:07,960
The spell doesn't want to go in here.

1993
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,880
That's safe passage.

1994
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,779
I mean, that okay.

1995
01:38:13,779 --> 01:38:17,439
Why did I do how how is okay?

1996
01:38:19,579 --> 01:38:20,579
They're very literal.

1997
01:38:20,779 --> 01:38:22,880
The spells are incredibly literal in this game.

1998
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,960
It's just going to tell me what is a safe way to go.

1999
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:32,520
It's information about the safest way of escape.

2000
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,659
Of course, I'm standing outside.

2001
01:38:37,859 --> 01:38:38,359
It's going to go.

2002
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:40,060
Hey dude, just go that way.

2003
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:40,859
Don't go in.

2004
01:38:40,859 --> 01:38:42,060
Why that's not safe.

2005
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:42,659
Go this way.

2006
01:38:44,649 --> 01:38:45,050
All right.

2007
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:49,270
Let's break it down taking a short run up.

2008
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:50,470
You charge at the door.

2009
01:38:50,949 --> 01:38:55,020
It rebounds heavily, but does not break a cool wind moves

2010
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:58,220
through the trees in the yard making evil whispering sounds.

2011
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,090
I just bounced off the door.

2012
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:05,189
I'm knocking on the door.

2013
01:39:06,109 --> 01:39:08,409
You walk up in the door to the door and knock just to make sure

2014
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:09,609
nobody answers knock again.

2015
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:14,000
You knock a second time louder as you wait to see if you

2016
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:14,699
will be answered.

2017
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,699
You notice a curious detail.

2018
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:21,470
There are deep grooves carved into the wood of the door radiating

2019
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:23,170
outwards from the keyhole.

2020
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:27,619
It is as though something had exploded out through it or

2021
01:39:27,619 --> 01:39:31,020
perhaps attached itself on the outside to force its way in

2022
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:35,069
through the lock is a bomb on the door.

2023
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,670
If I look through the keyhole, it's going to fucking hit me

2024
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,770
in the eyeball.

2025
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:45,020
I'm wasting so much health doing this.

2026
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:48,939
I got to just burnt the fucking whole thing down.

2027
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,260
I could do Dopp.

2028
01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:58,109
Let's just open it and let's open it and just jump out of

2029
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:02,180
the way hot you coward.

2030
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:03,680
Oh fine.

2031
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,380
I'll do it.

2032
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,079
Fine.

2033
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:05,680
I'll do it.

2034
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,859
You cast a spell crafting a flaming ball of fire in your

2035
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:13,560
palm, which you then hurl against the door.

2036
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,060
It explodes into a rain of hot splintering shards or the

2037
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,659
dark hallway beyond is revealed.

2038
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,760
We just blew up whatever was going on there.

2039
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,000
That was a magical door.

2040
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:33,010
I have 11 health.

2041
01:40:37,329 --> 01:40:41,659
You step inside the great stone house cold silence descends

2042
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:44,529
quite different from the dusty heat outside.

2043
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:48,090
This place feels like it has not been lived in for decades.

2044
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:52,020
Although judging by the lack of dust, it may not have been

2045
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,819
quite so long.

2046
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:57,109
Floorboards creak underfoot at the end of the hallway is a

2047
01:40:57,109 --> 01:41:00,640
sealed door that a chink of light just visible underneath

2048
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:09,890
the frame the light beneath the door flickers now bright now

2049
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:14,880
faint as though a figure pace back and forth its shadow

2050
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,279
coming and going but you hear no footsteps.

2051
01:41:26,989 --> 01:41:29,590
We're dead in this house by the way guys like we're going

2052
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,090
to die in here.

2053
01:41:30,189 --> 01:41:31,489
I just want everyone is aware of this.

2054
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,340
Throw another fire.

2055
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,840
Roll a fireball down the hallway.

2056
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,640
I do have potions.

2057
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:37,939
Okay, we're gone.

2058
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,020
You make your way along corridor the walls on either

2059
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:44,420
side are lined with large portraits of dusty looking

2060
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,420
men and sour-faced women.

2061
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:53,510
We sneer at you as you pass look at the paintings the

2062
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:56,109
figures in the paintings are all finely dressed, but they

2063
01:41:56,109 --> 01:41:59,479
also have knife scars on their faces and nicks in their

2064
01:41:59,479 --> 01:41:59,979
ears.

2065
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:05,130
These must be the thief kings of Carae's murky past you

2066
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:08,010
pass a large metal coal scuttle sitting against the

2067
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:08,810
left-hand wall.

2068
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:15,140
You are fucked.

2069
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:15,840
Look at the scuttle.

2070
01:42:16,829 --> 01:42:19,130
You stop to look inside the scuttle, but the inside is

2071
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,069
blackened and in the darkness.

2072
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:24,670
It seems as though an infinitely deep pit was contained

2073
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:29,560
inside run the pole.

2074
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,260
Am I put my hand in this thing or am I going to put it

2075
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:31,460
down?

2076
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:50,550
We're going to get sucked into this thing put it down.

2077
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:58,039
I'll put the hand in the while this wrong shit.

2078
01:42:58,039 --> 01:42:58,640
What the hell is that?

2079
01:42:59,399 --> 01:43:02,579
So while this runs while the pole runs.

2080
01:43:02,579 --> 01:43:03,680
I have a very important question.

2081
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:08,810
So the VOD shit can I publish the VOD at the end of

2082
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:12,960
this stream or is it just gone unless I'd like restart

2083
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,060
it?

2084
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:17,840
Yes.

2085
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,239
Okay.

2086
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:21,880
Yeah, we'll be there.

2087
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,579
All right, that's cool.

2088
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:24,279
All right, then I'm not that concerned about it anymore

2089
01:43:24,279 --> 01:43:24,479
then.

2090
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:30,409
Okay.

2091
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:35,989
Yeah, I mean it was obvious what was going to happen

2092
01:43:35,989 --> 01:43:36,289
here.

2093
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,920
Actually, I could if it's there privately, right?

2094
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:43,420
Let me see.

2095
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,100
Yep, it's there.

2096
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:52,899
All right.

2097
01:43:52,899 --> 01:43:55,090
Thank God that would have been horrible.

2098
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:55,890
Yeah, I see it privately.

2099
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:57,689
I can publish it later at the end of the stream.

2100
01:44:00,789 --> 01:44:01,289
Thank God.

2101
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:02,510
All right.

2102
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,710
Put my hand inside.

2103
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:10,210
You are not afraid you reach into the scuttle blind scuttle

2104
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,010
feels empty.

2105
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:14,779
Then your finger touches something sharp so sharp.

2106
01:44:14,779 --> 01:44:19,170
It stings take your arm out or search for the sharp thing.

2107
01:44:20,739 --> 01:44:23,829
I mean, okay, you put my hand in here.

2108
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,329
I'm not taking it out.

2109
01:44:25,939 --> 01:44:29,840
Search the sharp thing you feel around in the scuttle

2110
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,340
searching for the object and you find it earning another

2111
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:37,890
sharp prick more you keep feeling around and have a clear

2112
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:40,390
sense that something is climbing up your arm to your

2113
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,890
wrist.

2114
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,279
Shake it off.

2115
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:46,680
Shake it off.

2116
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,079
Shake it up.

2117
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,069
You shake your arm vigorously and then with your other

2118
01:44:51,069 --> 01:44:53,670
hand try to bat the thing away, but you feel a stinging

2119
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:56,470
pain in your other hand and a moment later you feel the

2120
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:59,260
same biting sensation on your neck.

2121
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,359
That's when you realize there's still something wrapped

2122
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:02,560
around your hand as well.

2123
01:45:02,859 --> 01:45:16,659
It's a snake kill it or run into the light or run into

2124
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:20,859
the light just sprinting into the light.

2125
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:29,029
I'm going to run into the light.

2126
01:45:30,109 --> 01:45:31,810
You have had enough of this torture in the dark.

2127
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:32,710
You race out of the house.

2128
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:33,710
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2129
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:34,609
That's not what I want to do.

2130
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,300
That's not what I want this one.

2131
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:37,800
And this is a this rewind doesn't count.

2132
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,680
This rewind doesn't count.

2133
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,229
That doesn't count.

2134
01:45:42,329 --> 01:45:42,930
That's not what I thought.

2135
01:45:43,029 --> 01:45:45,909
That's not what I wanted that rewind does not count.

2136
01:45:55,029 --> 01:45:57,989
Okay, so here we were for my hand inside.

2137
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,680
Okay, search for the sharp thing.

2138
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,760
Keep feeling around.

2139
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,149
Okay.

2140
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:05,850
What is it?

2141
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:08,739
Okay.

2142
01:46:08,739 --> 01:46:08,939
Yep.

2143
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:09,140
Yep.

2144
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,239
Yep.

2145
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:12,600
It's a snake kill it you make to raise your sword and

2146
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,800
kill the beast, but it is wrapped itself tightly around

2147
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,970
your wrists and now you cannot move your arms at all.

2148
01:46:18,729 --> 01:46:20,630
You've had enough of this torture in the dark you race

2149
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:21,130
out of the house.

2150
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:27,609
Oh fuck what as you hit the light the serpent hisses

2151
01:46:27,609 --> 01:46:29,710
and rears back and drops into the shadow.

2152
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:33,109
It must be a dark snake a creature whose bite is luckily

2153
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:34,909
not poisonous just itchy.

2154
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:37,850
Oh, we're fine.

2155
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:38,750
Back in the house.

2156
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,760
You take a moment to collect yourself and then you

2157
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,960
step back into the darkness of the corridor determined

2158
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,460
not to leave the house unexplored.

2159
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:46,439
Yeah, we're good.

2160
01:46:55,489 --> 01:46:57,189
You reach the far end of the hall.

2161
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,300
It is only a short way from the entrance, but all is

2162
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:01,199
now in shadow.

2163
01:47:01,899 --> 01:47:03,800
The only light that comes from the gap around the

2164
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:08,050
frame of the door in front of you more darkness wells

2165
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:09,350
up to the right.

2166
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:12,380
You can just make out the first few steps of a flight

2167
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:15,449
of stairs leading away upwards to the second level

2168
01:47:15,449 --> 01:47:16,050
of the house.

2169
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,140
He just wants you to leave so bad too.

2170
01:47:21,979 --> 01:47:24,279
All right, enter the study or up the stairs.

2171
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:30,779
Pull please study stairs.

2172
01:47:38,229 --> 01:47:38,829
I need to heal.

2173
01:47:38,829 --> 01:47:40,920
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

2174
01:47:45,449 --> 01:47:46,050
I'll just drink one.

2175
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:49,109
I have three more potions.

2176
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:02,640
Where are we going?

2177
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:10,199
Oh really into the study.

2178
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:10,800
Okay.

2179
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:12,090
Okay.

2180
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:20,340
You push open the door and enter a wide paneled room

2181
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:21,340
with a thick carpet.

2182
01:48:21,909 --> 01:48:24,800
It is a study of some kind the source of the light

2183
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,869
under the doorframe becomes quickly apparent a roaring

2184
01:48:27,869 --> 01:48:31,770
fire burns in an enormous grate on one side of the

2185
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:34,460
room.

2186
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:36,840
Okay, let's explore a little here.

2187
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:41,979
I'm gonna I'm gonna look around you search around the

2188
01:48:41,979 --> 01:48:42,380
room.

2189
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:46,380
The furniture is grand carved and stained and inlet

2190
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:49,100
with patterns of Goblin bone, but there are no

2191
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,199
possessions to be seen.

2192
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:51,199
No ornaments.

2193
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:51,899
No jewels.

2194
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:54,460
No treasure and no sign of the owner.

2195
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:57,729
It is as if whoever lived here had moved out or more

2196
01:48:57,729 --> 01:49:00,899
likely as though the place had been thoroughly robbed

2197
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:02,720
with the door shut.

2198
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:06,060
You'd expect this room to be sweating Lee hot like

2199
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:06,859
the rest of the house.

2200
01:49:06,859 --> 01:49:07,960
It is icy cold.

2201
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:12,899
No loot.

2202
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:16,130
This is not a quest German.

2203
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:17,130
This is a burglary.

2204
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:21,100
Yeah, well you want to be lawful good.

2205
01:49:21,399 --> 01:49:22,600
Hey, you go get it.

2206
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,529
You go over to the fire to warm your hands only to

2207
01:49:28,529 --> 01:49:30,229
find it emits no heat at all.

2208
01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:32,130
It burns no fuel either.

2209
01:49:32,819 --> 01:49:35,920
The enormous great large enough to roast a whole bore

2210
01:49:36,489 --> 01:49:40,479
is entirely empty of wood ash or coal, but the flames

2211
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:43,520
are nonetheless brilliant and as high as a man.

2212
01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:08,539
Great wind know how there is sus though fog summoned

2213
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:27,300
darkness is also magic protection protect from magic

2214
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,800
no need for sus.

2215
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,500
I mean I have to assume that it's probably I think I'm

2216
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,600
trying to remember what's in here.

2217
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:44,569
What if there's anything here I'm going to do I'm going

2218
01:50:44,569 --> 01:50:45,069
to do magic.

2219
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:46,670
Let's do protect from magic.

2220
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,600
You cast a spell in a veil of magical protection

2221
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:56,199
settles around you should any enchantment attack

2222
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,699
will be well protected for as long as the spell lasts

2223
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:06,539
what no no no no I want to oh shit.

2224
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,640
No no look at look this up.

2225
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:15,840
Okay, you can't show up.

2226
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:18,430
I'm reminding this doesn't count.

2227
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,630
Doesn't count doesn't count doesn't count doesn't count

2228
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,079
doesn't count look at the flames.

2229
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:28,619
All right doesn't count doesn't count peering deeper

2230
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:29,319
at the base of the fire.

2231
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:30,720
You see there's definitely nothing burning there.

2232
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,420
The flames spring into life fingers with above the

2233
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:36,859
great they're so bright you can make out nothing beyond

2234
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:39,159
but it seems that the hearth goes back some distance

2235
01:51:41,619 --> 01:51:45,840
wait, but I didn't cast the magic protection.

2236
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:46,640
Oh fuck it.

2237
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:49,789
Whatever stealing your courage you duck your head

2238
01:51:49,789 --> 01:51:53,720
and step into the great the flames surround you their

2239
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,920
crackles whispering in your ears as though you stood

2240
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,619
in a pit of snakes, but you feel no heat your skin

2241
01:51:59,619 --> 01:52:02,119
does not blister and your clothing does not ignite

2242
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,199
you stand in the middle of the fire like some kind of

2243
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:09,510
demon and feel no ill effects at all from here.

2244
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:11,510
You can see that the hearth extends backwards much

2245
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:12,710
further than you might expect.

2246
01:52:13,149 --> 01:52:16,420
Is it a tunnel or do you stand inside of a trap its

2247
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:22,979
jaws about to spring shut we go in you creep forward

2248
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:25,750
across the great through the flames and beyond into

2249
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:29,609
a low stone alcove hidden by the fire the walls are

2250
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:33,100
made of solid slabs of stone and there is nothing

2251
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:33,600
here.

2252
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:38,220
No treasure no secret doors on the fall on the far

2253
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:42,220
wall or a strange set of markings searings of long

2254
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:44,819
grooves like scratches radiating outwards from a

2255
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:45,819
small hole.

2256
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,520
What can we do?

2257
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,140
T what is T?

2258
01:52:59,539 --> 01:53:00,340
We don't have it.

2259
01:53:01,869 --> 01:53:02,770
I hate that.

2260
01:53:03,069 --> 01:53:03,970
I hate not.

2261
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:05,569
I hate knowing that there could have been something

2262
01:53:05,569 --> 01:53:05,869
here.

2263
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:07,569
We don't we don't know the spell.

2264
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:08,869
We don't know the spell.

2265
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:14,800
We got top this is open locks and doors, but I wonder

2266
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:15,500
if that work here.

2267
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:24,989
We have ought and how is also sap cause depression

2268
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:36,770
is also sus course will do top you cast the spell

2269
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:38,470
across the groove wall in front of you, but nothing

2270
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,970
happens.

2271
01:53:39,649 --> 01:53:42,489
Perhaps it's not a door after all or perhaps it is

2272
01:53:42,489 --> 01:53:44,989
locked with a fearsome magic your own spell cannot

2273
01:53:44,989 --> 01:53:45,590
overcome.

2274
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:51,750
It's impossible to be sure you run your fingers through

2275
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,949
the grooves in the stone wall.

2276
01:53:52,949 --> 01:53:54,649
They are a lot like the grooves you saw around the

2277
01:53:54,649 --> 01:53:56,050
keyhole of the front door.

2278
01:53:57,159 --> 01:53:58,159
Good thing I blew it up.

2279
01:53:59,409 --> 01:54:01,409
They have been carved lightly and roughly with a

2280
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:04,010
dagger point rather than a chisel perhaps, but the

2281
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:06,810
small hole at their center is much more cleanly

2282
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:07,310
formed.

2283
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,140
I blow this one up too.

2284
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:31,350
Bucket whatever you cast the spell creating a

2285
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:34,449
fireball of powerful heat and light in the palm of

2286
01:54:34,449 --> 01:54:38,090
your hand the dead end quickly heats up but in the

2287
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:40,590
light you can make out a few suggestive cracks in

2288
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:43,229
the left hand wall seems like one of the stones

2289
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:46,840
might move but how there's no way to tell then the

2290
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,640
fireball flickers and fades the cracks fall into

2291
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,140
shadow once more and the sweltering heat fades to

2292
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,039
your I just hurt my I threw a fireball myself.

2293
01:54:59,060 --> 01:54:59,560
Oh, no, I didn't.

2294
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,260
Well, what did I do?

2295
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:04,100
What did I do feel over the left hand wall you run

2296
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,500
your fingertips of the left hand wall, but can no

2297
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,000
longer find the cracks you saw in the light of your

2298
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,699
fireball.

2299
01:55:09,699 --> 01:55:10,600
Oh, come on.

2300
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,250
Come on.

2301
01:55:20,649 --> 01:55:21,750
Let me in here.

2302
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:28,180
Examine the hole you put one finger into the small

2303
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:28,680
hole.

2304
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:32,119
You cannot find the bottom of it and it seems polished

2305
01:55:32,119 --> 01:55:32,819
and smooth.

2306
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:35,460
It looks like the bolt hole you might find in the

2307
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:38,560
stonework of a fortress doorway except for its

2308
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,989
position in the middle of a blank wall that a keyhole

2309
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,479
you look through your pack for something to use as

2310
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:47,680
a key insert a pipe.

2311
01:55:48,439 --> 01:55:49,640
I have what I have a pipe.

2312
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:50,640
Where did I get a pipe?

2313
01:55:58,439 --> 01:56:07,939
Wait, wait, like my my musical pipe board if it

2314
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:08,539
breaks.

2315
01:56:12,539 --> 01:56:13,539
What if I break it?

2316
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,199
It's the flute.

2317
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,399
You might lose it.

2318
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:24,909
Oh, no inventory.

2319
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:28,520
Oh wait other items.

2320
01:56:29,979 --> 01:56:38,850
Apes teeth to snatocats teeth 204 gold a sword

2321
01:56:40,359 --> 01:56:41,460
beeswax skull cap.

2322
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:47,760
No, it has to be that I'm doing it.

2323
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:48,840
Do something else.

2324
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:53,909
Fuck fuck.

2325
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:00,649
Free free.

2326
01:57:00,649 --> 01:57:04,850
Okay, free rewind free rewind free.

2327
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:05,350
I got a free.

2328
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:06,449
I get a free rewind.

2329
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:21,649
Okay keyhole insert the pipe you slip the bamboo

2330
01:57:21,649 --> 01:57:23,350
flute into the small hole in the back of the

2331
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:24,050
fireplace.

2332
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:26,640
There's a click for a moment.

2333
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,239
Nothing happens.

2334
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:28,939
And then very slowly the stones begin to move a

2335
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:30,340
passageway has opened.

2336
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:37,520
I do I get to keep it I do.

2337
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:37,819
All right.

2338
01:57:37,819 --> 01:57:38,720
I get to keep the flute.

2339
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,710
Let's go you peer through the secret passage,

2340
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:46,909
but can make out nothing but darkness beyond

2341
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:48,710
you'll have to go inside to find out what you

2342
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:56,699
have discovered flipping through the narrow

2343
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:57,000
opening.

2344
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,100
You find yourself in a slightly wider space.

2345
01:57:59,829 --> 01:58:01,630
The walls are cool stone and there are no

2346
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:05,329
windows, but the room is not dark in one corner

2347
01:58:05,329 --> 01:58:08,630
and idle stands on a small shrine lit by two

2348
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:11,029
candles, which burn with thin cold flames.

2349
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:14,050
This place reeks of death and decay.

2350
01:58:14,449 --> 01:58:16,949
The shrine is covered in thin blood soaked strips

2351
01:58:16,949 --> 01:58:17,550
of cloth.

2352
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:26,369
All right, let's look at it.

2353
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:29,649
The shrine is poor and cheap.

2354
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:33,010
Unlike everything else in the house seems to

2355
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:35,909
have been hastily built out of uneven stones

2356
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,100
and a plank of wood and the small statue of a

2357
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:42,609
fat God that sits on it has been molded from

2358
01:58:42,609 --> 01:58:43,409
humble clay.

2359
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,859
This is a cloth.

2360
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:55,850
The bandages are each an arm span long and as

2361
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:58,520
deep as your thumb each is bloodied in two

2362
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,359
places spaced a few fingers widths apart.

2363
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:04,880
There are 30 or 40 such bandages here running

2364
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,680
down from the shrine like streamers.

2365
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:09,319
Someone was injured for a long time.

2366
01:59:10,670 --> 01:59:13,470
You glance behind you suddenly terrified that

2367
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:15,970
the secret door might swing shut and leave you

2368
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:17,069
trapped in this place.

2369
01:59:20,619 --> 01:59:22,920
Oh, okay.

2370
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,420
Let's let's look at the God.

2371
01:59:26,039 --> 01:59:28,779
It must be some local deity at the base of the

2372
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:32,810
statue is the name Corga above his head is a

2373
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:35,310
plaque with a short inscription and on his

2374
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:37,609
face are painted for red dots.

2375
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,979
You're starting to get the jitters down here.

2376
01:59:48,979 --> 01:59:49,779
Read the inscription.

2377
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:54,060
The inscription is scrawled as though in the hand

2378
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:54,859
of a child.

2379
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,159
You have to squint to read it.

2380
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,819
Give me back my eyes.

2381
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:07,319
Okay, the dots on the idol seem to have been

2382
02:00:07,619 --> 02:00:09,020
daubed with a fingertip.

2383
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:11,880
They're perhaps directions on how to worship

2384
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,510
the God but there's no indication of what to do

2385
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:18,289
or in what order only the places both eyes the

2386
02:00:18,289 --> 02:00:20,590
third eye in his forehead and his mouth.

2387
02:00:25,479 --> 02:00:26,479
Give me back my eyes.

2388
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:33,869
Should I search the bandages out out out get out

2389
02:00:33,869 --> 02:00:37,390
get out get out you sift through the pile of

2390
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:39,689
bloodied cloth strips quickly.

2391
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:42,449
Something gleams from within the pile and you

2392
02:00:42,449 --> 02:00:43,850
want to cover a silver badge.

2393
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:46,050
It is the badge of a noble of Kare.

2394
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:51,270
The badge is solid silver and probably valuable.

2395
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:53,569
You place it carefully into your pack.

2396
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:55,560
There's nothing more to be seen in this terrible

2397
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:55,960
place.

2398
02:00:56,569 --> 02:00:58,270
You slip back out of the small room out of the

2399
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,569
fireplace and into the hallway.

2400
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:00,770
You found a clue.

2401
02:01:11,689 --> 02:01:17,869
Okay, the ritual of Corga and I got a silver

2402
02:01:17,869 --> 02:01:18,569
badge.

2403
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:23,029
Where is it?

2404
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:28,689
Badge of the seventh noble.

2405
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:32,340
Ooh, do you look at that?

2406
02:01:35,029 --> 02:01:39,970
All right, let's head back out compared to the

2407
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:40,369
little room.

2408
02:01:40,369 --> 02:01:42,170
You've just left the dark and empty hallway seems

2409
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:44,680
welcoming and friendly but not so much that you

2410
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:45,579
plan to linger.

2411
02:01:48,229 --> 02:01:49,029
We're going upstairs.

2412
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:49,529
Are we going?

2413
02:01:49,529 --> 02:02:00,760
Are we leaving the house stick around go up go

2414
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,779
up go up go up.

2415
02:02:02,779 --> 02:02:07,029
Okay, we're going up you place your foot on the

2416
02:02:07,029 --> 02:02:09,130
first step of the stairwell and suddenly it

2417
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:10,130
begins to move.

2418
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:12,729
Is it alive or some kind of thin flat beast or

2419
02:02:12,729 --> 02:02:16,199
is it a trap grab the handrail stay still or

2420
02:02:16,199 --> 02:02:24,640
jump hole time jump back stay still or grab the

2421
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,039
handrail.

2422
02:02:30,449 --> 02:02:31,949
So none of those rewinds counted, right?

2423
02:02:31,949 --> 02:02:42,189
I still have two they all counted.

2424
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:45,630
I have two real rewinds remaining.

2425
02:02:46,109 --> 02:02:47,210
You have none remaining.

2426
02:02:51,619 --> 02:02:52,220
They counted.

2427
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:59,239
No, they didn't count doesn't matter.

2428
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:04,479
You change the rules every time you have two

2429
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:05,079
rewinds.

2430
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,079
They don't exist.

2431
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:06,680
They don't count.

2432
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,520
I don't change the rules every time look the

2433
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,619
first time I rewind.

2434
02:03:12,619 --> 02:03:14,319
I made the wrong choice.

2435
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:16,520
I thought I was going to be able to walk through

2436
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,739
the end of the fire, right?

2437
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:21,449
I that was come on.

2438
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:25,800
All right.

2439
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,399
What are we doing here?

2440
02:03:28,439 --> 02:03:32,600
Looks like I'm grabbing the handrail you grab the

2441
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,800
handrail to steady yourself only to find it is

2442
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,100
moving as well.

2443
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:39,159
I'm going to hold on here.

2444
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:42,149
I'm going to hold on you cling onto the rail to

2445
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:42,949
keep yourself upright.

2446
02:03:42,949 --> 02:03:45,050
It seems the rail is moving at the same speed as

2447
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:46,149
the step underneath you.

2448
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:48,789
You rise to the top of the stairwell in a smooth

2449
02:03:48,789 --> 02:03:51,760
motion and jump off in perfect safety.

2450
02:03:52,819 --> 02:03:54,420
It was just an automatic stair thing.

2451
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:56,850
It's just like an escalator.

2452
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:00,869
There's nothing scary about that.

2453
02:04:01,539 --> 02:04:04,439
It was just a way to go up the stairs.

2454
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,279
Okay.

2455
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:13,569
Well, we made it if you jump you probably get hurt.

2456
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:14,689
Okay.

2457
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:17,609
You look around you're on the upstairs landing with

2458
02:04:17,609 --> 02:04:18,510
doors on either side.

2459
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,880
I have to assume we're probably going to get to go

2460
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:29,149
to each of these will start with the bedroom and

2461
02:04:29,149 --> 02:04:30,550
then well, maybe we'll start with the library.

2462
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:36,210
This is a library in darkness at the far end a

2463
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,909
pair of eyes stare back at you.

2464
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:43,380
Who's there you call out the creature at the other

2465
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:44,979
side of the room makes no reply.

2466
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:46,579
In fact, it makes no sound at all.

2467
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:53,279
The distant eyes have yet not blinked you step

2468
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:56,680
forward boldly your own eyes fixed on those across

2469
02:04:56,680 --> 02:05:00,239
the room from you did you not blink they don't even

2470
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:01,340
move as you approach.

2471
02:05:04,369 --> 02:05:05,569
I mean, you know harm.

2472
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:08,779
All right.

2473
02:05:08,779 --> 02:05:11,180
I'm going to say stare it out.

2474
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:19,100
I'm going to say I mean, you know harm you raise

2475
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:20,699
your hands to indicate you mean no harm.

2476
02:05:20,699 --> 02:05:24,329
The eyes do not react and you see why they're the

2477
02:05:24,329 --> 02:05:27,300
eyes of a large portrait that hangs over the far

2478
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:31,069
wall in shadow, but for a dim Sunbeam falling

2479
02:05:31,069 --> 02:05:32,369
through a gap in the roof above.

2480
02:05:33,869 --> 02:05:39,000
All right, but wouldn't you do the guys this world

2481
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,699
of thieves creatures robbers killers assassins

2482
02:05:42,699 --> 02:05:44,399
your you're going to do the same exact thing.

2483
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:49,090
The painting is of a proud and stern looking man

2484
02:05:49,090 --> 02:05:51,789
dressed in loose leather armor with a serpent emblem

2485
02:05:51,789 --> 02:05:54,550
stitched along the length of one arm the painting

2486
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:56,050
fills the entire wall of the room.

2487
02:05:56,529 --> 02:05:59,130
It must be twice the height of the man who posed

2488
02:05:59,130 --> 02:05:59,729
for the likeness.

2489
02:06:02,569 --> 02:06:05,359
Look at the man you step back a little to regard

2490
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:06,260
the man in the picture.

2491
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:08,859
The most striking thing about him are his eyes

2492
02:06:09,529 --> 02:06:10,529
cold and cruel.

2493
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:13,859
They seem to gleam with cunning and the will to

2494
02:06:13,859 --> 02:06:14,460
survive.

2495
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:18,060
They are the eyes of a man who would harm you if

2496
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,859
it suited him knowing full well what it did.

2497
02:06:22,489 --> 02:06:22,890
I'm sorry.

2498
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:25,409
I've ruined that moment knowing fell.

2499
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:26,510
No, sorry.

2500
02:06:26,609 --> 02:06:27,310
Let me restart.

2501
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,779
They are the eyes of a man who would harm you

2502
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:34,250
if it suited him knowing full well what it was

2503
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:34,850
he did.

2504
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:38,270
Otherwise he stands tall and proud with one hand

2505
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:40,439
on the hilt of a sword and the other wielding a

2506
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:41,340
tiny dagger.

2507
02:06:41,979 --> 02:06:44,079
Everything about him reeks of power in a threat.

2508
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,859
The picture must be of the man that lived in the

2509
02:06:46,859 --> 02:06:48,060
house for anyone else.

2510
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,560
It would surely cast too long a shadow to live

2511
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,420
beneath the eyes of the painting seem to follow

2512
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:55,289
you as you move.

2513
02:06:55,489 --> 02:06:56,390
Audiobook Andy.

2514
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:01,060
You raised one corner of the frame from the wall

2515
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:03,800
and here up behind it, but it's too dark to see

2516
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,899
if there's anything hidden there.

2517
02:07:06,439 --> 02:07:08,439
I take the painting off the wall or no, don't do

2518
02:07:08,439 --> 02:07:08,739
that.

2519
02:07:13,699 --> 02:07:14,399
Take the painting off.

2520
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:15,300
I mean, why not?

2521
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:18,350
You grab the base of the painting between

2522
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:21,649
outstretched hands and heft the frame up and off

2523
02:07:21,649 --> 02:07:23,350
the hook that holds it to the wall.

2524
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:25,939
There is a moment when you think you have it under

2525
02:07:25,939 --> 02:07:26,539
control.

2526
02:07:27,079 --> 02:07:29,180
Then you are holding the true weight of the picture

2527
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:31,079
and begin to stagger backwards.

2528
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:34,170
I got it.

2529
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,569
I got it.

2530
02:07:34,569 --> 02:07:34,869
I got it.

2531
02:07:34,869 --> 02:07:35,270
I got it.

2532
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,670
I got it.

2533
02:07:37,609 --> 02:07:39,409
I don't what if it explodes?

2534
02:07:39,949 --> 02:07:43,130
I'm going to try to balance it you backpedal across

2535
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,829
the room trying to keep your balance.

2536
02:07:45,229 --> 02:07:47,430
The painting threatens to topple at any moment.

2537
02:07:47,829 --> 02:07:49,630
If you can just get turned around, you'll be able

2538
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:51,430
to lean the painting against the wall.

2539
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:53,880
Stay still step back.

2540
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:54,380
I got hurt.

2541
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:56,680
Step backwards into the left step backwards into

2542
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:03,880
the right left gang.

2543
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:08,630
No, I don't know though.

2544
02:08:15,979 --> 02:08:19,640
Left step backwards to the left.

2545
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,640
You step backwards into the left and bring the

2546
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:23,939
painting down to the floor to rest safely against

2547
02:08:23,939 --> 02:08:24,739
the opposite wall.

2548
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:26,609
You rub your arms with relief.

2549
02:08:28,199 --> 02:08:28,699
Really?

2550
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,579
I thought we were dead.

2551
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:32,979
You by the way, you probably can just get squished.

2552
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,979
You can just get squished probably by the painting

2553
02:08:34,979 --> 02:08:35,479
and die.

2554
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,359
What a shitty way to go.

2555
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:39,350
Okay.

2556
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:40,350
Look at the back of the canvas.

2557
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:41,449
See I didn't want to break it.

2558
02:08:41,449 --> 02:08:45,770
This is the reason why with the painting tilted

2559
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:46,670
against the side wall.

2560
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:48,470
You're able to slip around and look at the back of

2561
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:50,569
the canvas in the weak light that trickles in through

2562
02:08:50,569 --> 02:08:51,069
the door.

2563
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,359
It is unremarkable which is the single inscription

2564
02:08:54,359 --> 02:08:55,560
near the middle of the canvas.

2565
02:08:56,739 --> 02:08:59,220
Theta Seventh Noble of Kare.

2566
02:09:00,899 --> 02:09:03,199
The painting looks like a noble all right, or at

2567
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:05,600
least it looks like the painting a noble would have

2568
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:09,239
made of themselves.

2569
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:10,939
Theta Seventh Noble of Kare.

2570
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:15,960
You look over the wall to where the painting had hung

2571
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:17,260
but there's nothing else of interest.

2572
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,560
It's just a dark outline.

2573
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:21,550
You turn your attention to the portrait.

2574
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:22,250
There's nothing left.

2575
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:25,079
You found one new clue and another clue has been

2576
02:09:25,079 --> 02:09:25,579
updated.

2577
02:09:26,949 --> 02:09:28,350
All right, we know who the Seventh Noble is.

2578
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:37,710
Lord Theta is the Seventh Noble of Kare.

2579
02:09:42,699 --> 02:09:45,500
Lord Sansus is the First Noble of Kare and only he

2580
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:47,500
knows the full spell to open the North Gate.

2581
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,819
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2582
02:09:50,819 --> 02:09:52,020
I remember this now.

2583
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:57,590
Yeah, the spell and the nobles and oh, yeah, this

2584
02:09:57,590 --> 02:09:58,890
is this is this is nuts.

2585
02:09:59,529 --> 02:10:00,229
I remember this.

2586
02:10:01,789 --> 02:10:02,989
Okay, top of the stairs.

2587
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:07,069
You return to the top of the stairs.

2588
02:10:08,329 --> 02:10:10,029
We're obviously going to go in here because why

2589
02:10:10,029 --> 02:10:10,930
not explore the whole thing?

2590
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:15,460
You step through a doorway into a simple bedroom.

2591
02:10:15,859 --> 02:10:18,159
The bed is unmade and looks as though its owner

2592
02:10:18,159 --> 02:10:18,960
left in a hurry.

2593
02:10:19,569 --> 02:10:21,369
Personal effects are scattered all over the floor

2594
02:10:21,369 --> 02:10:23,770
as if the place has been ransacked, which it

2595
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:24,470
probably was.

2596
02:10:25,329 --> 02:10:27,029
A cane leans by the bedside.

2597
02:10:27,569 --> 02:10:28,869
You see nothing else of interest.

2598
02:10:30,779 --> 02:10:31,380
Look at the cane.

2599
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:34,670
The cane is a simple straight stick with a leather

2600
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,470
loop at the top to slip around the wearer's

2601
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:36,869
wrist.

2602
02:10:37,479 --> 02:10:39,279
It does not look like any sort of weapon.

2603
02:10:39,939 --> 02:10:41,439
It does not appear to be magic.

2604
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:42,670
It's a cane.

2605
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:43,369
Should I take the cane?

2606
02:10:45,250 --> 02:10:45,649
Why not?

2607
02:10:45,649 --> 02:10:46,149
It's a cane.

2608
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:51,699
Take it.

2609
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,899
You take it, although you cannot think what it

2610
02:10:54,899 --> 02:10:55,699
might be for.

2611
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,979
Second door leads further into the house or you

2612
02:10:57,979 --> 02:10:58,979
could return to the stairwell.

2613
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:01,460
I got a cane now, boys and girls.

2614
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:01,960
Look at this.

2615
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:05,859
Walking cane.

2616
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:06,960
Let's go.

2617
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:07,760
Let's go.

2618
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:14,439
The further door leads into a bathroom.

2619
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:16,439
There's nothing in it, not even a mirror.

2620
02:11:16,739 --> 02:11:18,439
Only a gap where one used to hang.

2621
02:11:18,979 --> 02:11:21,079
The only fixture is an empty iron bathtub in the

2622
02:11:21,079 --> 02:11:22,380
middle of the tiled floor.

2623
02:11:23,310 --> 02:11:24,609
Look under the bath.

2624
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:28,060
You crouch down and peer under the bath.

2625
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:30,560
Something darts at your face and you leap back.

2626
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:38,300
Look again or run my sword under the bath or leave.

2627
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:39,539
We need to pull here.

2628
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:47,159
Look again, run the sword underneath.

2629
02:11:59,479 --> 02:12:00,279
Stare.

2630
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:01,579
What's under the bath?

2631
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:03,279
It could be a creature.

2632
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:04,180
It could be a monster.

2633
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,979
It could be something harmless.

2634
02:12:15,729 --> 02:12:16,529
It could be.

2635
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:17,630
That's right.

2636
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,239
All right.

2637
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:21,840
It seems like look again is the answer.

2638
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:24,979
Yep.

2639
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:25,579
Okay.

2640
02:12:25,579 --> 02:12:26,279
We're going to look again.

2641
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:31,979
You crouch down again and peer under the bath a

2642
02:12:31,979 --> 02:12:32,779
second time.

2643
02:12:32,979 --> 02:12:35,079
Just in time to see a rat disappearing through a

2644
02:12:35,079 --> 02:12:36,180
crack in the floorboards.

2645
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,819
You head out of the room.

2646
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:40,619
It's just a rat.

2647
02:12:47,619 --> 02:12:48,619
Return to the bedroom.

2648
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:51,050
Think that's it for the house.

2649
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:54,699
You walk back out of the hall.

2650
02:12:54,699 --> 02:12:56,399
There's nothing more to explore up here so we can

2651
02:12:56,399 --> 02:12:57,100
go downstairs.

2652
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:01,939
There does not seem to be anything more to be

2653
02:13:01,939 --> 02:13:02,539
discovered.

2654
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:05,880
Stairs are quite normal now.

2655
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:07,779
Okay.

2656
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:09,369
Out of the house.

2657
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:15,310
This house is home now only to ghosts.

2658
02:13:15,789 --> 02:13:18,090
You hurry back out the door into the sunshine of

2659
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:18,890
the front garden.

2660
02:13:20,579 --> 02:13:21,279
Outside.

2661
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:21,880
We made it out.

2662
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:23,680
Made it out.

2663
02:13:24,739 --> 02:13:25,340
Outside the house.

2664
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:26,439
The sun is shining brightly.

2665
02:13:26,439 --> 02:13:28,539
It is almost the hottest hour of the day.

2666
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:31,180
Interesting.

2667
02:13:32,909 --> 02:13:33,409
Okay.

2668
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:38,970
So we can go the path around the house.

2669
02:13:39,369 --> 02:13:43,800
Leave back to the main road or just go look at the

2670
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:44,199
fountain.

2671
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:54,609
Go hot the horse.

2672
02:14:01,779 --> 02:14:03,680
How come you're rattling around a plastic cup?

2673
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:05,770
I'm going to look at the fountain first.

2674
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:07,270
It's just I mean it's easy here.

2675
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:08,970
A fountain by the door is still bubbling.

2676
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:10,770
Cupping your hands you drink a deep mouthful and

2677
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:11,470
feel much better.

2678
02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:12,470
Oh fucking hell yeah.

2679
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:12,970
Easy.

2680
02:14:16,010 --> 02:14:16,310
All right.

2681
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:17,210
So now what?

2682
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:17,710
Now what?

2683
02:14:20,979 --> 02:14:21,579
Okay.

2684
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:26,619
All right.

2685
02:14:26,619 --> 02:14:27,319
Main.

2686
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,010
So we're going to say one, two.

2687
02:14:31,649 --> 02:14:32,750
I'll give you a big look.

2688
02:14:34,659 --> 02:14:36,880
One, two.

2689
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:41,079
One, two.

2690
02:14:45,479 --> 02:14:45,979
Which way?

2691
02:14:51,770 --> 02:14:53,880
One, two.

2692
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:04,369
Nice optometrist.

2693
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:07,989
This is 50-50.

2694
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:11,260
All right.

2695
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:12,560
I might have to let this one go because I don't know

2696
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,909
that's an important decision because obviously we

2697
02:15:15,909 --> 02:15:17,109
can go this way.

2698
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:19,079
There's a lot of random stuff here.

2699
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,220
There's also a lot of random shit over here too.

2700
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:29,159
It's unanimously 50-50.

2701
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:29,560
It is.

2702
02:15:31,829 --> 02:15:32,029
All right.

2703
02:15:32,029 --> 02:15:34,260
Actually, I'm going to go pee and I'm going to get

2704
02:15:34,359 --> 02:15:35,159
refill my drink.

2705
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:37,739
I will literally be right back.

2706
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:41,039
And please have one of the mods tell me what happened.

2707
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:41,920
You're back.

2708
02:21:04,979 --> 02:21:05,379
All right.

2709
02:21:08,569 --> 02:21:09,370
Have you guys got some?

2710
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:11,270
Ooh, that's some nice sounds.

2711
02:21:13,670 --> 02:21:14,870
He's looking under the bathtub.

2712
02:21:19,579 --> 02:21:21,680
Two, one by three boats?

2713
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:22,280
No.

2714
02:21:25,569 --> 02:21:26,270
Is the VOD going to be?

2715
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:26,670
Yeah.

2716
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:28,770
So Twitch changed something with the VODs.

2717
02:21:28,870 --> 02:21:32,319
They didn't auto publish anymore, but I do have

2718
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:32,920
access to it.

2719
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:34,520
So I will be able to publish it after the stream.

2720
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:35,420
So it's there.

2721
02:21:37,659 --> 02:21:38,459
Yeah, that's unanimous.

2722
02:21:38,459 --> 02:21:38,659
Yeah.

2723
02:21:38,659 --> 02:21:39,059
All right.

2724
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:40,739
So we're going with option two.

2725
02:21:42,110 --> 02:21:42,709
Sounds like it.

2726
02:21:48,370 --> 02:21:49,170
Okay, let's go.

2727
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:50,340
You guys good?

2728
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:50,940
You guys ready?

2729
02:21:55,329 --> 02:21:57,829
You follow the path around the back of the building.

2730
02:21:58,329 --> 02:22:01,430
The rear is simply boarded up and secure with no new

2731
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:02,829
ways in that you can see.

2732
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:06,899
There's a low stone wall partially ruined for which

2733
02:22:06,899 --> 02:22:10,170
the path continues turning into a track that runs

2734
02:22:10,170 --> 02:22:11,770
away through fields.

2735
02:22:13,659 --> 02:22:14,760
Oh, we were not going back.

2736
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:16,059
We're going this way.

2737
02:22:20,569 --> 02:22:21,270
Follow the track.

2738
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:24,719
You follow the track clamoring over a fence into a

2739
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:26,620
wide stretch of grazing land.

2740
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:29,850
A rocky bluff on the left-hand side throws the path

2741
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:30,649
into a shadow.

2742
02:22:31,319 --> 02:22:34,819
On the top of this rise is the bulk of Kare squatting

2743
02:22:34,819 --> 02:22:36,319
like a gigantic toad.

2744
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:39,360
The fields themselves are on the lower plane.

2745
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:42,719
All right.

2746
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:45,319
So we don't, we only have this decision to go this

2747
02:22:45,319 --> 02:22:48,530
way, which is going to probably give us a few things

2748
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:49,030
to do here.

2749
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:49,829
So here we go.

2750
02:22:50,129 --> 02:22:50,629
Keep going.

2751
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:57,819
You continue along the track leaving the buildings of

2752
02:22:57,819 --> 02:22:58,819
lower Kare behind.

2753
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:01,420
There's no one can leave the walls of Kare.

2754
02:23:01,719 --> 02:23:04,819
They do their farming here inside the walls as best

2755
02:23:04,819 --> 02:23:05,219
they can.

2756
02:23:05,979 --> 02:23:07,879
After walking for a half an hour or so the path meets

2757
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:08,680
a wide road.

2758
02:23:09,079 --> 02:23:11,479
You hear a groaning sound from a nearby field like

2759
02:23:11,479 --> 02:23:13,379
someone was being cruelly hurt.

2760
02:23:14,629 --> 02:23:15,530
Look for the noise.

2761
02:23:17,059 --> 02:23:20,360
Half a dozen fat pigs are grubbing in the muck to

2762
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:20,760
the right.

2763
02:23:21,629 --> 02:23:24,430
Just beyond them, a group of creatures huddle around

2764
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:27,840
a fire pit from which there drifts a mouthwatering

2765
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:28,340
smell.

2766
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:32,600
Kare seems to be filled with creatures you can't

2767
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:33,000
place.

2768
02:23:33,399 --> 02:23:35,899
Half one thing, half another, but from the way the

2769
02:23:35,899 --> 02:23:38,500
strange creatures of the fire pit sit and talk, it

2770
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,700
seems they do not see their own differences.

2771
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:46,239
One sees you however, beckoning with a large clawed

2772
02:23:46,239 --> 02:23:46,639
hand.

2773
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:52,329
Okay, so we're being beckoned over to the fire.

2774
02:23:52,799 --> 02:23:53,600
Oh boy.

2775
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,100
All right.

2776
02:23:55,680 --> 02:24:01,600
Approach the fire, turn down the road or up at the

2777
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:02,399
next junction.

2778
02:24:06,629 --> 02:24:09,840
This is going to dictate I think at least we might

2779
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,700
be able to do this, but this is going to be a major

2780
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:14,100
decision here because we're going to go obviously

2781
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:16,399
down and probably down through here or up and then

2782
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:16,899
around here.

2783
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:20,420
Should we should vibe out with the new friends?

2784
02:24:21,059 --> 02:24:22,260
Um, yeah, fuck it.

2785
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,360
Let's go vibe out with the friends.

2786
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:28,270
You clamber over the fence and stride towards the

2787
02:24:28,270 --> 02:24:28,870
creatures.

2788
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:32,010
Within a few paces, the smell of cooking meat reaches

2789
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:34,809
your nostrils and you see a large pig turning on a

2790
02:24:34,809 --> 02:24:35,909
spit above the fire.

2791
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:39,340
The creature who waved to you has watched you approach.

2792
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:43,350
He grins hooked teeth and cocks his head at you in

2793
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:43,850
greeting.

2794
02:24:44,930 --> 02:24:47,329
Perhaps using magic might give you an advantage.

2795
02:24:48,889 --> 02:24:49,889
What do we got?

2796
02:24:59,969 --> 02:25:01,370
But I do hold on.

2797
02:25:02,979 --> 02:25:03,479
Dud?

2798
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:06,379
I can just be like look at all this treasure I have.

2799
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:08,879
I've got millions of dollars.

2800
02:25:14,379 --> 02:25:16,479
Hot cannot become the new Zap.

2801
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,280
All right.

2802
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,780
Just all right.

2803
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:21,780
Imagine seeing a guy like a cloak.

2804
02:25:22,379 --> 02:25:23,879
You're like, hey, come over here.

2805
02:25:23,879 --> 02:25:25,079
We've got fresh meat.

2806
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,879
Delicious pork.

2807
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:29,579
And you see the guy like kind of waving his arms

2808
02:25:29,579 --> 02:25:31,780
around and doing two or three crow hops.

2809
02:25:32,579 --> 02:25:33,379
He's like, what's he?

2810
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:35,879
And then he just fucking from the outfield and

2811
02:25:35,879 --> 02:25:37,379
centerfield throws baseball.

2812
02:25:37,879 --> 02:25:39,780
Like literally at your camp and it's a fireball.

2813
02:25:40,079 --> 02:25:40,879
Why would you do that?

2814
02:25:47,989 --> 02:25:49,389
Sausage is also available too.

2815
02:25:49,389 --> 02:25:49,889
I don't remember.

2816
02:25:49,889 --> 02:25:50,389
I forget.

2817
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:50,989
I don't remember this.

2818
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,799
Just do jig.

2819
02:25:52,799 --> 02:25:55,469
But that's so easy.

2820
02:25:55,469 --> 02:25:56,670
And I don't know what it's gonna do.

2821
02:25:57,899 --> 02:25:59,799
They have oh because they have weird teeth.

2822
02:25:59,899 --> 02:26:00,700
Yeah, that's why.

2823
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,479
Are we close enough though?

2824
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,780
We might not be close enough.

2825
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:11,940
Are we close enough for jig?

2826
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,940
I think you have to be within.

2827
02:26:13,239 --> 02:26:14,239
I think they have to be able to hear it.

2828
02:26:19,979 --> 02:26:21,680
Why did that guy just pull out a fucking flute?

2829
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:25,809
Yeah, we could just say hi to but I don't have to

2830
02:26:25,809 --> 02:26:26,709
be a threat.

2831
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:32,030
I'm gonna greet the creatures greetings.

2832
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:33,610
That smells good.

2833
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:36,819
It is the creature agrees.

2834
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:40,989
We pick the best one to bite into come come here.

2835
02:26:40,989 --> 02:26:41,389
Come here.

2836
02:26:41,389 --> 02:26:43,690
Sit down and you understand his generosity.

2837
02:26:43,690 --> 02:27:15,700
They're poachers pull out your pipe and cast the

2838
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:18,500
spell and begin to play the leader poacher gets

2839
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:21,600
to his feet and to the amusement of his fellows.

2840
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,940
He begins to dance dragging up two of his friends soon

2841
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:28,639
the whole encampment is on its feet clapping jumping

2842
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:30,340
and falling about and enjoyment.

2843
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:34,280
In fact your spell quickly wears off but the poachers

2844
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:37,670
continue to enjoy themselves after they tire the

2845
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:41,520
pig is fully roasted the lead poacher claps you on

2846
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:46,719
the back and gestures for you to sit down you take a

2847
02:27:46,719 --> 02:27:49,219
place in the circle around the fire the creature shuffle

2848
02:27:49,219 --> 02:27:50,620
and shift to make room for you.

2849
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:57,940
Okay, so they that was that that was a great time

2850
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:00,479
to them ask for some pig.

2851
02:28:01,469 --> 02:28:02,170
I haven't eaten.

2852
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:03,670
I think I have to eat.

2853
02:28:07,690 --> 02:28:10,790
May I share your pig you ask the poachers laugh.

2854
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:16,790
It's not our pig and there's plenty there help yourself.

2855
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:20,469
So they say this is this is this is bad.

2856
02:28:20,469 --> 02:28:21,069
This is evil.

2857
02:28:21,069 --> 02:28:25,000
This is evil behavior, but I'm going to eat reach

2858
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,399
over the fire and pull off a leg of the pig and devour

2859
02:28:27,399 --> 02:28:31,069
it the meat is succulent and rich and the best meal

2860
02:28:31,069 --> 02:28:34,040
you have had in a long while you thank the poachers

2861
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:39,780
who shrug indifferently asking about curry.

2862
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:40,479
Let's start with this.

2863
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:43,750
I'm new to curry you tell the gathered poachers as

02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:44,850

They suck their teeth and humming her car is the big

2868
02:28:56,049 --> 02:28:59,860
place one finally answers full of people pushing each

2869
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:00,760
other for power.

2870
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:03,860
He pulls a leg from the pig making the meat tear

2871
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:07,559
and stretch to demonstrate you want to avoid all them

2872
02:29:07,559 --> 02:29:11,620
if you can what about the North Gate?

2873
02:29:13,379 --> 02:29:14,780

2874
02:29:14,979 --> 02:29:16,079

The North Gate is a hard thing to open.

2882
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:59,350
I've never heard of anyone doing it the spell lines

2883
02:30:01,690 --> 02:30:04,979
from across the field of woman begins to sing the

2884
02:30:04,979 --> 02:30:07,479

You'll see by now the woman has reached the group.

2896
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,620
She greets the men with a kiss on either cheek.

2897
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,120
You notice she's carrying something carefully in a

2898

cloth the man beside you beckons her to sit down beside

2899

02:31:14,409 --> 02:31:16,209
She reveals an orb of crystal.

2908
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,420

You got to play the long game.

2918
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:03,180

Will we have an opportunity to get an orb?

02:32:09,399 --> 02:32:11,399
Do we keep talking and do I eventually get what I

2923

You're a fortune teller.

2933
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:48,510
Cerise sees all one of the poachers calls out for

2934
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:52,510

have their fortune told.

2937
02:33:04,450 --> 02:33:06,879
Do we hear a fortune or should we have somebody

2938
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:07,479
else do it first?

2939
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:19,139
I'll hear my fortune you declare the men cheer and

2941
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:25,260
She holds out a palm cross my palm with silver.

2942
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:35,989
She says, oh no, I want it.

2943
02:33:35,989 --> 02:33:38,840
What is that gold?

2944
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:44,719
She's going to know city noble badge.

2945
02:33:49,709 --> 02:33:50,610
Will she take it?

2946
02:33:50,909 --> 02:33:51,510
I don't know.

2947
02:33:53,969 --> 02:33:56,170
Well, these are all these are like poachers guys.

2948
02:33:57,129 --> 02:33:59,870
What if she's what if they why are we believing

2949
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:02,690
this by the way, this could just be completely

2950
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:03,290
full of shit.

2951
02:34:04,340 --> 02:34:06,940
They're poachers and they're like eating a pig at

2952
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:07,639
a campfire.

2953
02:34:09,079 --> 02:34:10,879
What if this lady just doesn't even what if she's

2954
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:14,479
not a fortune teller this gives me some person

2955
02:34:14,479 --> 02:34:15,479
that's not a fortune teller.

2956
02:34:17,079 --> 02:34:17,579
I'm going to do it.

2957
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:23,299
Gold piece is not this is not going to work.

2958
02:34:23,299 --> 02:34:31,010
No way do I there are friends you have to rewind

2959
02:34:31,010 --> 02:34:32,510
I'm going to do it off her the city noble badge.

2960
02:34:32,510 --> 02:34:32,809
I'm doing it.

2961
02:34:32,809 --> 02:34:33,209
I did it.

2962
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:36,770
You remove the nobles badge you found in the

2963
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:39,440
abandoned house and place it into her palm her

2964
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:42,739
eyes widen suddenly she recognizes it for what it

2965
02:34:42,739 --> 02:34:44,639
is and looks suddenly to your face with a

2966
02:34:44,639 --> 02:34:47,799
searching expression then that expression paces

2967
02:34:48,299 --> 02:34:49,500
passes into puzzlement.

2968
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:51,780
How came you buy this?

2969
02:34:52,489 --> 02:34:53,290
Are you a noble?

2970
02:34:55,790 --> 02:34:56,389
I found it.

2971
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:57,670
I killed a noble.

2972
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:58,569
I am a noble.

2973
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:01,229
This is a fucking lie.

2974
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:03,649
If she's a fortune teller.

2975
02:35:03,649 --> 02:35:10,200
She knows that I found it.

2976
02:35:11,629 --> 02:35:12,430
I found it.

2977
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:17,049
You told them you're new.

2978
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:19,600
I found it.

2979
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:20,399
I found it.

2980
02:35:21,389 --> 02:35:23,690
The woman looks into your eyes for a long moment

2981
02:35:23,690 --> 02:35:27,200
then nods very well.

2982
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,239
It is silver and will do.

2983
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:32,280
She closes her fist and nods.

2984
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:33,479
It's acceptable.

2985
02:35:35,399 --> 02:35:37,299
She places her palms on the crystal and begins

2986
02:35:37,299 --> 02:35:39,950
to hum watch out for this one.

2987
02:35:39,950 --> 02:35:41,549
Sirisi one of the men calls.

2988
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:45,159
He's a sorcerer himself and all it doesn't look

2989
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:47,559
like any fortune-telling spell you have ever

2990
02:35:47,559 --> 02:35:55,069
read about wait and watch a minute passes and

2991
02:35:55,069 --> 02:35:56,770
then sirisi's eyes flick open.

2992
02:35:57,979 --> 02:35:59,280
I see a long journey.

2993
02:35:59,479 --> 02:36:01,379
She says to you to a distant land.

2994
02:36:02,139 --> 02:36:03,840
I see danger and excitement.

2995
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:04,340
All right.

2996
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:06,040
This is I could get this a Chuck E cheese.

2997
02:36:07,159 --> 02:36:08,159
This is nonsense.

2998
02:36:09,090 --> 02:36:10,190
This is clearly nonsense.

2999
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:13,290
She's a charlatan her little performance continues.

3000
02:36:14,819 --> 02:36:19,329
I see more you must watch or a dagger and a fish

3001
02:36:20,219 --> 02:36:22,620
see a road paved with white stone leading to a

3002
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:23,920
place of great sadness.

3003
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:27,120
A blind man who will stab you in the back.

3004
02:36:28,239 --> 02:36:30,639
She lifts her palm from the glass and smiles.

3005
02:36:31,239 --> 02:36:35,489
Someone gets her some pork to eat offer to read

3006
02:36:35,489 --> 02:36:36,590
hers in return.

3007
02:36:36,790 --> 02:36:37,690
I'll do yours too.

3008
02:36:39,059 --> 02:36:40,559
Let me try reading your fortune.

3009
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:43,159
You declare into the quiet that follows her reading

3010
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:46,840
you will tell everyone else's you always do that.

3011
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:49,829
You must be curious about your own sirisi stops

3012
02:36:49,829 --> 02:36:50,729
eating to stare at you.

3013
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:52,700
There's a murmur of excitement from the group.

3014
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:58,319
This is the most unusual you and what do you know

3015
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:03,639
of fortune-telling I doesn't look for I'm a sorcerer.

3016
02:37:05,239 --> 02:37:08,840
She raises a thin dark eyebrow in a cool surprise.

3017
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:13,350
Are you you hold out a hand for the crystal orb

3018
02:37:13,959 --> 02:37:15,360
not taking her eyes off you.

3019
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:16,659
She puts it in your hand.

3020
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:19,659
Then she sits defiantly down in front of you.

3021
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:24,090
Well, then tell me what you see for poor old sirisi.

3022
02:37:24,879 --> 02:37:27,280
She declares her eyes flashing with the challenge.

3023
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:29,549
You take a moment to collect your thoughts.

3024
02:37:30,030 --> 02:37:33,329
The orb is pleasingly heavy in your palm.

3025
02:37:45,889 --> 02:37:47,690
See, whoa, I could do it.

3026
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:48,190
I can do it.

3027
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:48,989
I can actually do it.

3028
02:37:50,590 --> 02:37:53,790
I know the zapper hot is not available.

3029
02:37:54,489 --> 02:37:54,889
Hell.

3030
02:37:56,620 --> 02:38:01,059
Wait, I could just read her mind.

3031
02:38:05,770 --> 02:38:13,829
Dud create treasure and create stink.

3032
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:14,930
Oh what?

3033
02:38:16,620 --> 02:38:18,219
Hey, I'll read your fortune.

3034
02:38:18,219 --> 02:38:19,219
Let me see your pie.

3035
02:38:19,219 --> 02:38:20,120
Pull my finger.

3036
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:26,260
That's that's like what like a fucking drunk uncle does.

3037
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:26,860
You know what I mean?

3038
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:28,760
Like that's what I was about to do that.

3039
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:30,059
I'm not a sorcerer.

3040
02:38:35,510 --> 02:38:36,309
What else is there?

3041
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:38,409
I just float in the air.

3042
02:38:38,409 --> 02:38:39,209
That'd be stupid.

3043
02:38:39,409 --> 02:38:40,209
I can do it.

3044
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:41,709
Should I do it?

3045
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:43,899
Do I read her?

3046
02:38:43,899 --> 02:38:48,200
Do I actually see her future or do I do I just read her mind?

3047
02:38:55,059 --> 02:38:55,459
All right.

3048
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:57,950
All right, let's do it.

3049
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,780
Cast a spell placing your hands on the crystal orb.

3050
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:07,540
Your mind clears and a vision forms, but it is not of Cerise

3051
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:09,340
and her future, but of your own.

3052
02:39:10,299 --> 02:39:13,799
You see yourself in a low stone shrine somewhere here in

3053
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:14,600
the city of Kare.

3054
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:17,870
A man in a long white robe stands at your elbow.

3055
02:39:18,270 --> 02:39:19,270
He is speaking.

3056
02:39:22,989 --> 02:39:26,770
What is the answer to the question that has never been asked?

3057
02:39:28,879 --> 02:39:31,079
You see your own mouth opening to reply.

3058
02:39:35,329 --> 02:39:40,129
You concentrate as hard as you can struggling to maintain

3059
02:39:40,129 --> 02:39:41,530
the vision of Thanos.

3060
02:39:42,530 --> 02:39:44,510
Don't stop.

3061
02:39:44,809 --> 02:39:45,110
Stop.

3062
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:46,510
We're getting into this here.

3063
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:48,110
We're getting into this.

3064
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:51,280
Kylo Ren.

3065
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:55,559
Come on.

3066
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,760
We were getting into this.

3067
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:00,760
We were really engrossed in this and then you had to say

3068
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:01,860
fucking Thanos.

3069
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:11,989
It's thematically accurate too because like what the fuck?

3070
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:15,659
You concentrate as hard as you can struggling to maintain

3071
02:40:15,659 --> 02:40:16,260
the vision.

3072
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:19,959
Then as it begins to slip, there is a touch on your hand.

3073
02:40:20,159 --> 02:40:22,459
Another presence joins yours.

3074
02:40:24,989 --> 02:40:25,790
Cerise.

3075
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:27,319
You breathe.

3076
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:31,979
In your vision, you see the man in the white robe bow his

3077
02:40:31,979 --> 02:40:34,079
head, defeated at the word.

3078
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,000
The vision fades.

3079
02:40:36,479 --> 02:40:38,680
Cerise is watching you intently waiting to hear her

3080
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:39,180
fortune.

3081
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,780
The crowd around lean eagerly in.

3082
02:40:46,450 --> 02:40:47,450
I see your fortune.

3083
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:48,250
You begin.

3084
02:40:51,069 --> 02:40:52,670
I see you losing several friends.

3085
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:55,590
See you telling great fortunes.

3086
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:02,920
That's so dumb.

3087
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:04,319
I see you.

3088
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:12,309
See you losing.

3089
02:41:12,610 --> 02:41:13,610
It's definitely one.

3090
02:41:13,909 --> 02:41:15,709
I see you losing several friends.

3091
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:21,049
You say and you see her smile slip a little.

3092
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:23,840
Is that all?

3093
02:41:24,819 --> 02:41:25,520
She asks.

3094
02:41:26,870 --> 02:41:28,670
I see you giving me this orb.

3095
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:31,270
I see you divulging a secret.

3096
02:41:35,469 --> 02:41:36,170
You continue.

3097
02:41:37,059 --> 02:41:38,760
Cerise looks stunned by your words.

3098
02:41:39,059 --> 02:41:40,959
She clearly believes you are a true psychic.

3099
02:41:41,979 --> 02:41:44,579
A great and weighty decision seems to pass across her

3100
02:41:44,579 --> 02:41:44,979
face.

3101
02:41:45,649 --> 02:41:47,549
She looks to you for a moment to confirm it.

3102
02:41:48,149 --> 02:41:50,049
Then nods once more and turns to her friends.

3103
02:41:50,950 --> 02:41:52,149
Please be quiet.

3104
02:41:52,149 --> 02:41:52,750
All of you.

3105
02:41:54,209 --> 02:41:55,209
Stranger is right.

3106
02:41:56,079 --> 02:41:57,180
I must make a confession.

3107
02:42:01,629 --> 02:42:03,129
Why would you slip away at this point?

3108
02:42:03,739 --> 02:42:04,440
Wait and watch.

3109
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:06,399
You wait and watch.

3110
02:42:07,739 --> 02:42:09,139
I'm not a fortune teller.

3111
02:42:09,809 --> 02:42:11,110
Cerise continues sadly.

3112
02:42:11,709 --> 02:42:12,610
That's my secret.

3113
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:14,200
What?

3114
02:42:15,059 --> 02:42:16,559
The poachers cannot believe their ears.

3115
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:17,260
One denies it.

3116
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:18,959
Another claims to have known all along.

3117
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:22,260
A third who it seems lost a lot of money on a bet once

3118
02:42:22,459 --> 02:42:25,260
becomes quite enraged and is held back by two more.

3119
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:28,219
Within a few moments the whole group are rolling around in

3120
02:42:28,219 --> 02:42:31,620
the mud enraged in the most almighty punch-up.

3121
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:35,899
Let's get out of here.

3122
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:38,020
Let's get out of here.

3123
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:44,799
Slip away with the orb or we could I mean friends or like

3124
02:42:44,799 --> 02:42:46,200
do we just fuck off with the orb?

3125
02:42:46,399 --> 02:42:47,500
Pull one or two.

3126
02:42:47,799 --> 02:42:48,299
What do you want to do?

3127
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:52,000
Break up the fight and keep talking or get out of here

3128
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:52,399
with the orb.

3129
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:01,799
Neutral Andy.

3130
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:03,500
Hey, I'm making a lot of decisions.

3131
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:05,000
I want to leave some of them up to you too.

3132
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:05,899
It's more fun that way.

3133
02:43:11,690 --> 02:43:13,090
The poachers helped you.

3134
02:43:15,299 --> 02:43:16,000
They did.

3135
02:43:16,299 --> 02:43:19,100
But this is a crystal orb that I can use to read people's

3136
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:19,600
futures.

3137
02:43:20,659 --> 02:43:22,159
It's not guaranteed that we're going to keep this.

3138
02:43:25,739 --> 02:43:27,940
Maybe they'll give the orb if I break it up and

3139
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:31,139
or maybe I go to break it up and one of them grabs a

3140
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:32,739
battle axe and tries to hit me in the head with it.

3141
02:43:33,659 --> 02:43:34,159
I don't know.

3142
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:35,260
I actually don't know.

3143
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:36,159
I don't remember this.

3144
02:43:37,469 --> 02:43:40,069
The best part about games like this is there's like thousands

3145
02:43:40,069 --> 02:43:44,069
of options that after five to six plus years, it's like

3146
02:43:44,069 --> 02:43:45,370
I'm playing the game all over again.

3147
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:46,569
Anyways, it's great.

3148
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:49,139
All right.

3149
02:43:49,139 --> 02:43:49,739
What are we doing?

3150
02:43:51,659 --> 02:43:54,959
It looks like we're looks like we're going to run away here.

3151
02:43:55,260 --> 02:43:56,059
We're going to slip away.

3152
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,100
That's called forgetting.

3153
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:06,450
All right, let's get out of here.

3154
02:44:06,450 --> 02:44:08,979
Slip away with the orb in the commotion.

3155
02:44:08,979 --> 02:44:11,879
It's easy for you to get away until one of the men

3156
02:44:11,879 --> 02:44:14,280
shouts, it's all his fault.

3157
02:44:15,170 --> 02:44:15,469
Run.

3158
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:20,139
You try to run, but a man the size of a horse dives for

3159
02:44:20,139 --> 02:44:22,840
your legs and a moment later you're down in the mud in

3160
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:24,639
the middle of the bruise up of your life.

3161
02:44:25,319 --> 02:44:28,219
You crawl out from under a pile of 15 men.

3162
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:30,520
Wait, where did these other people come from?

3163
02:44:30,819 --> 02:44:32,120
Where did these other people come from?

3164
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:35,020
You find the precious orb has shattered to a million

3165
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:37,719
fragments and several of those fragments have cut you

3166
02:44:37,719 --> 02:44:38,920
in the leg inside.

3167
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,020
You what?

3168
02:44:42,799 --> 02:44:44,500
You limp back to the road.

3169
02:44:46,290 --> 02:44:46,790
What?

3170
02:44:46,889 --> 02:44:51,329
No, where are these other who are these 15 men that

3171
02:44:51,329 --> 02:44:51,930
showed up?

3172
02:44:51,930 --> 02:44:54,729
Why would there were three of what they're like three

3173
02:44:54,729 --> 02:44:55,530
people here.

3174
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:00,420
They were literally three people sitting at this fire.

3175
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:02,620
Why they have 15 people here now.

3176
02:45:03,739 --> 02:45:05,239
They were just grabbing people off the road and

3177
02:45:05,239 --> 02:45:05,840
punching them.

3178
02:45:09,559 --> 02:45:10,760
It's rewind time.

3179
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:11,360
Is it?

3180
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:15,229
I don't it's his fault.

3181
02:45:16,930 --> 02:45:18,829
It's like I just I pictured it.

3182
02:45:19,930 --> 02:45:20,530
There he is.

3183
02:45:20,530 --> 02:45:22,329
It's him and I turn it.

3184
02:45:22,329 --> 02:45:23,729
I don't know why I'm just seeing this image in my

3185
02:45:23,729 --> 02:45:26,329
head of like I've got a bunch of food in my mouth and

3186
02:45:26,329 --> 02:45:27,329
I've got a big bag.

3187
02:45:27,329 --> 02:45:29,530
You don't need a big bag of food and I'm stealing

3188
02:45:29,530 --> 02:45:31,229
the food and I've got my cheeks to puffed out like

3189
02:45:31,229 --> 02:45:33,329
a hamster right like me.

3190
02:45:33,870 --> 02:45:34,969
I don't know why that's what I see.

3191
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:38,229
I only get two rewinds.

3192
02:45:47,469 --> 02:45:48,069
I don't know.

3193
02:45:48,069 --> 02:45:50,370
I think we have to live with it because I don't I

3194
02:45:50,370 --> 02:45:52,969
don't want to waste a rewind because what if I'd

3195
02:45:52,969 --> 02:45:55,469
messed it up all the way through and it's probably

3196
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:57,170
okay, there's like probably three or four different

3197
02:45:57,170 --> 02:45:58,270
ways to get that orb.

3198
02:45:58,670 --> 02:46:04,899
What if we pass that point shit?

3199
02:46:06,489 --> 02:46:11,129
You go away with the orb and get tackled by the

3200
02:46:11,329 --> 02:46:13,829
get tackled by the safety, you know, that was in

3201
02:46:13,829 --> 02:46:14,829
the back apparently.

3202
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:16,819
All right.

3203
02:46:16,819 --> 02:46:17,520
I'm going to use it.

3204
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:18,219
I'm going to use it.

3205
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:20,459
I'm going to use it.

3206
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:21,700
We're going to rewind.

3207
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:22,799
I only get one more.

3208
02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:25,899
Okay, so we're going to we're going to do everything

3209
02:46:25,899 --> 02:46:27,000
the same way I did before.

3210
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:28,500
It was gig.

3211
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:33,440
What should I say?

3212
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:33,840
Fuck it.

3213
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:35,139
Just throw a fireball.

3214
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:37,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3215
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:38,040
We're going to break him up.

3216
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:40,139
But what if it doesn't work?

3217
02:46:44,350 --> 02:46:45,850
What if it doesn't work?

3218
02:46:46,819 --> 02:46:47,719
It was greet them.

3219
02:46:47,719 --> 02:46:48,819
Oh, greetings.

3220
02:46:48,819 --> 02:46:49,719
That smells good.

3221
02:46:50,219 --> 02:46:50,620
It is.

3222
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:50,920
Okay.

3223
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:51,219
All right.

3224
02:46:51,219 --> 02:46:51,520
All right.

3225
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:53,780
So I don't need to, I don't need to waste any

3226
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:53,979
spell.

3227
02:46:53,979 --> 02:46:54,780
I can just sit down.

3228
02:46:55,389 --> 02:46:55,989
I'm just gonna sit down.

3229
02:47:00,399 --> 02:47:02,399
Just cause mayhem immediately.

3230
02:47:03,549 --> 02:47:04,850
Just do everything the same way.

3231
02:47:04,850 --> 02:47:05,250
Okay.

3232
02:47:10,350 --> 02:47:11,549
Just retrace the steps.

3233
02:47:11,549 --> 02:47:12,049
All right.

3234
02:47:15,809 --> 02:47:17,209
Everyone's having a good time.

3235
02:47:17,809 --> 02:47:19,209
Ask for some food.

3236
02:47:19,909 --> 02:47:21,209
Yes, take some.

3237
02:47:21,209 --> 02:47:22,309
That was delicious.

3238
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:23,350
All right.

3239
02:47:23,350 --> 02:47:24,350
Ask about the gate.

3240
02:47:24,750 --> 02:47:25,950
Hey, why you want to go there?

3241
02:47:25,950 --> 02:47:26,950
That's my business.

3242
02:47:26,950 --> 02:47:27,549
I'm sorry.

3243
02:47:28,049 --> 02:47:28,649
Okay.

3244
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:34,040
Um, okay.

3245
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:36,739
Uh, wait, what?

3246
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:37,340
Did I change?

3247
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:37,739
What happened?

3248
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:41,620
I just, did I do something wrong?

3249
02:47:42,969 --> 02:47:44,170
The North Gate is a hard thing to open.

3250
02:47:45,159 --> 02:47:45,860
The spell lines.

3251
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:46,459
He nods.

3252
02:47:46,559 --> 02:47:46,760
Okay.

3253
02:47:46,760 --> 02:47:47,559
Did I do this already?

3254
02:47:47,860 --> 02:47:48,159
What?

3255
02:47:48,459 --> 02:47:50,059
Who could I ask about the lines?

3256
02:47:51,309 --> 02:47:52,309
Ask him about Kari.

3257
02:47:55,149 --> 02:47:55,950
I'm new to Kari.

3258
02:47:55,950 --> 02:47:56,350
Okay.

3259
02:47:56,649 --> 02:47:56,950
All right.

3260
02:47:56,950 --> 02:47:57,549
We're good.

3261
02:47:57,549 --> 02:47:57,950
We're good.

3262
02:47:58,629 --> 02:47:59,629
Who is Cerise?

3263
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:02,260
Oh, here she comes.

3264
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:02,659
Okay.

3265
02:48:02,860 --> 02:48:03,659
Help me how?

3266
02:48:04,739 --> 02:48:05,940
I need to open the North Gate.

3267
02:48:06,139 --> 02:48:06,440
Right?

3268
02:48:10,569 --> 02:48:11,069
That's correct.

3269
02:48:11,069 --> 02:48:11,270
Right?

3270
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:14,370
Oh, tricky.

3271
02:48:14,370 --> 02:48:15,170
That's very tricky.

3272
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:18,899
Oh, you're, you're a fortune teller.

3273
02:48:19,299 --> 02:48:19,799
Yes.

3274
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,299
Yes.

3275
02:48:20,299 --> 02:48:20,700
Okay.

3276
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:21,799
Let me hear my fortune.

3277
02:48:22,299 --> 02:48:23,100
All right.

3278
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:24,600
And then of course we had kind of run.

3279
02:48:25,329 --> 02:48:25,629
Okay.

3280
02:48:25,629 --> 02:48:26,329
Take the badge.

3281
02:48:27,159 --> 02:48:27,459
Yep.

3282
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:28,540
Okay.

3283
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:29,540
I found it.

3284
02:48:29,739 --> 02:48:31,040
Should I change my answer?

3285
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:35,920
Should I change my answer here?

3286
02:48:37,670 --> 02:48:40,569
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3287
02:48:40,569 --> 02:48:40,969
Okay.

3288
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,469
But what if I say something different?

3289
02:48:43,270 --> 02:48:44,469
What the fuck was that?

3290
02:48:44,770 --> 02:48:45,069
Okay.

3291
02:48:45,069 --> 02:48:46,770
I got like chills for a second.

3292
02:48:47,569 --> 02:48:50,870
Like, you know, uh, chills and I was laughing right when I was weird.

3293
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:52,059
All right.

3294
02:48:52,059 --> 02:48:52,459
I found it.

3295
02:48:53,479 --> 02:48:53,780
All right.

3296
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:54,180
It'll work.

3297
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:54,879
Wait and watch.

3298
02:48:55,620 --> 02:48:56,719
See a long journey.

3299
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:58,620
I said, this is nonsense.

3300
02:48:59,090 --> 02:48:59,989
She's a charlatan.

3301
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:00,899
All right.

3302
02:49:00,899 --> 02:49:02,200
Let me read yours in return.

3303
02:49:03,889 --> 02:49:04,889
I am a sorcerer.

3304
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:06,389
Really?

3305
02:49:06,690 --> 02:49:07,190
Okay.

3306
02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:07,790
Let's go.

3307
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:22,389
Read her mind.

3308
02:49:22,389 --> 02:49:23,690
No, I have to do it the same way.

3309
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:27,420
I can't do it.

3310
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:28,219
Oh, I can't change it.

3311
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:28,920
I'm okay.

3312
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:29,719
You can't.

3313
02:49:29,719 --> 02:49:30,920
I could have done hot and run.

3314
02:49:31,690 --> 02:49:31,989
All right.

3315
02:49:31,989 --> 02:49:32,290
All right.

3316
02:49:32,290 --> 02:49:32,389
All right.

3317
02:49:32,389 --> 02:49:32,790
Here we go.

3318
02:49:32,989 --> 02:49:33,590
Keep listening.

3319
02:49:34,739 --> 02:49:35,440
Here we go.

3320
02:49:35,739 --> 02:49:36,540
Cerise.

3321
02:49:37,219 --> 02:49:37,520
Yes.

3322
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,920
You breathe in your vision.

3323
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:40,620
I see your fortune.

3324
02:49:41,229 --> 02:49:41,829
Yes.

3325
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:44,370
I see you losing several friends.

3326
02:49:45,479 --> 02:49:45,979
Okay.

3327
02:49:45,979 --> 02:49:46,280
Wait.

3328
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:48,379
You have a secret to do.

3329
02:49:48,379 --> 02:49:48,680
Wait.

3330
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:53,239
Don't divulge to the secret.

3331
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:57,739
She.

3332
02:49:57,739 --> 02:49:58,040
Okay.

3333
02:49:58,040 --> 02:49:59,139
This is what causes the brawl.

3334
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,200
If I just say, I see you giving me this orb.

3335
02:50:04,079 --> 02:50:04,479
Right.

3336
02:50:04,959 --> 02:50:06,959
Because this is, she goes, I have a secret.

3337
02:50:07,159 --> 02:50:09,659
I'm not a real fortune teller.

3338
02:50:09,659 --> 02:50:11,059
And then people start punching each other in the face.

3339
02:50:11,059 --> 02:50:12,860
And then 15 people start fighting on the road.

3340
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:15,920
Should I do that?

3341
02:50:18,799 --> 02:50:19,600
She won't give it to you.

3342
02:50:20,270 --> 02:50:21,170
Do we know that though?

3343
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:22,930
She won't believe you.

3344
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:25,829
I see you divulging a secret.

3345
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:26,770
Okay.

3346
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:28,680
But I don't have the orb.

3347
02:50:30,379 --> 02:50:30,879
All right.

3348
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:32,860
I must make a confession.

3349
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:34,239
Wait and watch.

3350
02:50:36,059 --> 02:50:36,559
All right.

3351
02:50:37,479 --> 02:50:38,579
People are fighting.

3352
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:40,180
People are fighting each other.

3353
02:50:41,430 --> 02:50:42,430
I'm going to break them up.

3354
02:50:42,629 --> 02:50:43,030
All right.

3355
02:50:43,030 --> 02:50:43,629
Break it up.

3356
02:50:43,629 --> 02:50:44,129
Break it up.

3357
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:46,020
It's a messy fight.

3358
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:50,719
You weighed in trying to hold the poachers apart and keep the men from throwing each other into the fire.

3359
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:52,719
There's nothing you can do to keep them apart.

3360
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:57,520
A moment later, someone snatches the orb from your hands and cracks it over another man's head.

3361
02:50:57,819 --> 02:51:01,620
You crawl up under a pile of bodies and hurry back up to safety.

3362
02:51:01,819 --> 02:51:03,219
I fucked it up halfway through.

3363
02:51:03,219 --> 02:51:04,620
I have to tell her to give me the orb.

3364
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,219
I have to tell her to give...

3365
02:51:07,889 --> 02:51:09,989
I just got like snow globed in the head.

3366
02:51:09,989 --> 02:51:10,389
Okay.

3367
02:51:10,389 --> 02:51:13,389
I have to go back and say give me the orb.

3368
02:51:13,790 --> 02:51:14,389
I'm going back.

3369
02:51:16,629 --> 02:51:17,030
I'm going back.

3370
02:51:17,030 --> 02:51:17,530
I'm going back.

3371
02:51:17,530 --> 02:51:18,030
I'm going back.

3372
02:51:18,030 --> 02:51:19,030
I want this fucking orb.

3373
02:51:21,870 --> 02:51:23,469
And I'm going to say I see you give...

3374
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:25,969
When she tells the secret, everybody starts fighting each other.

3375
02:51:28,469 --> 02:51:28,969
I'm going back.

3376
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:31,000
I swear to God, last try.

3377
02:51:35,420 --> 02:51:35,819
Hold on.

3378
02:51:35,819 --> 02:51:36,620
I just want to see what happens.

3379
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:54,719
You cast your spell building an enormous fireball in your palm doing three or four crow hops, which you'll hurl at the roasting pig.

3380
02:51:55,299 --> 02:52:00,299
The fire pit explodes in a wide shower of sparks that knocks the poachers onto their back.

3381
02:52:00,700 --> 02:52:04,200
The pig is charred to a black hulk and the fire turns to ash.

3382
02:52:05,350 --> 02:52:06,850
The poachers are furious.

3383
02:52:07,149 --> 02:52:08,549
But more than that, they are terrified.

3384
02:52:08,549 --> 02:52:10,450
They quickly scatter, leaving nothing behind.

3385
02:52:11,159 --> 02:52:12,459
Capture a pig for myself.

3386
02:52:13,059 --> 02:52:17,659
You waste another half hour scurrying around the fields trying to catch a pig to eat on your own.

3387
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:19,979
But without help, it's impossible.

3388
02:52:20,280 --> 02:52:22,879
And the pigs, though fat, are quite nimble enough to avoid you.

3389
02:52:23,549 --> 02:52:25,950
Eventually, mud soaked and hungrier than ever, you give up.

3390
02:52:28,739 --> 02:52:29,040
Okay.

3391
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:29,340
All right.

3392
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:29,639
All right.

3393
02:52:29,639 --> 02:52:30,340
Let's go for real.

3394
02:52:30,739 --> 02:52:31,139
For real.

3395
02:52:31,139 --> 02:52:31,440
For real.

3396
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:32,040
I promise.

3397
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:33,440
I need to get this fucking orb.

3398
02:52:34,459 --> 02:52:35,059
Hello.

3399
02:52:35,059 --> 02:52:35,559
Greetings.

3400
02:52:35,559 --> 02:52:36,459
That smells good.

3401
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:38,120
Excellent.

3402
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:46,469
Would anyone care to dance?

3403
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:50,139
Okay.

3404
02:52:50,139 --> 02:52:50,540
Excellent.

3405
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:51,639
Can I have some of that pig?

3406
02:52:52,340 --> 02:52:52,840
Mm.

3407
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:54,170
Delicious.

3408
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:55,770
What do you know about Kare?

3409
02:52:56,569 --> 02:52:57,069
Kare?

3410
02:52:57,069 --> 02:52:57,270
Yeah.

3411
02:52:57,270 --> 02:52:57,770
Why do you?

3412
02:52:57,770 --> 02:52:58,469
What's the North Gate?

3413
02:52:58,870 --> 02:53:00,069
Oh, well, somebody, yeah.

3414
02:53:00,069 --> 02:53:01,069
What are you doing here?

3415
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:01,969
It's my business.

3416
02:53:02,370 --> 02:53:03,270
Okay.

3417
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:04,370
Who is this lady?

3418
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:05,549
I don't know.

3419
02:53:05,649 --> 02:53:06,250
Who is that?

3420
02:53:06,750 --> 02:53:07,450
Can I help you?

3421
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:08,750
I want to open the gate.

3422
02:53:09,389 --> 02:53:10,590
Oh, that's very tricky.

3423
02:53:10,790 --> 02:53:11,989
I could read your fortune.

3424
02:53:12,190 --> 02:53:12,790
You could?

3425
02:53:12,889 --> 02:53:13,290
Tell me.

3426
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:14,590
Are you really a fortune teller?

3427
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:15,889
I'd like to hear my fortune.

3428
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:16,989
Oh, sit with me.

3429
02:53:16,989 --> 02:53:17,389
Sit with me.

3430
02:53:17,389 --> 02:53:17,889
Sit with me.

3431
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:19,590
Oh, I need something silver.

3432
02:53:19,590 --> 02:53:19,889
Here.

3433
02:53:19,889 --> 02:53:20,389
Take that.

3434
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,889
Oh, ow.

3435
02:53:23,239 --> 02:53:23,940
Where'd you get this?

3436
02:53:23,940 --> 02:53:24,440
Found it.

3437
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:26,180
Oh, really?

3438
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:26,680
Hmm.

3439
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:26,979
Hmm.

3440
02:53:26,979 --> 02:53:29,280
Well, it seems like you are...

3441
02:53:29,579 --> 02:53:30,979
Oh, you're...

3442
02:53:31,379 --> 02:53:32,180
You're a charlatan.

3443
02:53:32,379 --> 02:53:33,479
You're a stupid charlatan.

3444
02:53:33,479 --> 02:53:33,979
I hate you.

3445
02:53:34,520 --> 02:53:35,420
Let me read yours.

3446
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:36,819
You fucking moron.

3447
02:53:37,799 --> 02:53:38,500
Oh, what a...

3448
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:40,299
Are you sure you can do that spell?

3449
02:53:40,299 --> 02:53:40,700
Yes.

3450
02:53:41,409 --> 02:53:41,909
Oh.

3451
02:53:42,709 --> 02:53:43,309
Okay, do it.

3452
02:54:02,309 --> 02:54:04,510
Placing the skullcap on your head, you cast the spell.

3453
02:54:04,809 --> 02:54:06,610
You begin to hear Cerise's thoughts.

3454
02:54:07,319 --> 02:54:08,319
Who is this idiot?

3455
02:54:08,690 --> 02:54:09,889
Is he really a magician?

3456
02:54:10,290 --> 02:54:12,790
What if he tells the others that my powers are all false?

3457
02:54:13,229 --> 02:54:15,030
Her expression is a fixed smile.

3458
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:16,829
Oh, so you could get around it.

3459
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:22,100
Okay.

3460
02:54:22,639 --> 02:54:24,639
So, I see your fortune.

3461
02:54:30,040 --> 02:54:30,540
Okay.

3462
02:54:31,370 --> 02:54:34,600
Now, I see you losing several friends.

3463
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:36,719
You missed a fucking clue.

3464
02:54:36,719 --> 02:54:37,219
What?

3465
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,020
Why did you tell me to do that spell?

3466
02:54:40,069 --> 02:54:40,969
What are you talking about?

3467
02:54:40,969 --> 02:54:41,969
You're missing an important clu...

3468
02:54:44,579 --> 02:54:45,479
Give me this orb!

3469
02:54:46,540 --> 02:54:48,440
I see you giving me this orb, you continue.

3470
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:49,440
Then you remove the skullcap.

3471
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:50,239
The spell is finished.

3472
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:51,940
Cerise looks stunned by your words.

3473
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:53,340
She clearly believes you're a psychic.

3474
02:54:53,739 --> 02:54:55,739
A great and weighty decision seems to pass across her face.

3475
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:56,940
She looks to you for a moment.

3476
02:54:57,239 --> 02:54:58,139
Please be quiet.

3477
02:54:58,610 --> 02:54:59,409
Wait and watch.

3478
02:55:00,979 --> 02:55:02,479
Fuck, I can't take the orb.

3479
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:03,379
I can't get it.

3480
02:55:04,299 --> 02:55:05,500
And I lost the clue.

3481
02:55:11,129 --> 02:55:12,629
There has to be a way I can get it.

3482
02:55:12,829 --> 02:55:13,629
There has to be.

3483
02:55:14,309 --> 02:55:16,110
They wouldn't give you the option if there wasn't a way to do it.

3484
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:18,319
Flip away with the orb.

3485
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:20,500
It's all his fault.

3486
02:55:21,579 --> 02:55:22,579
Oh, fuck.

3487
02:55:22,680 --> 02:55:23,180
Whatever.

3488
02:55:23,280 --> 02:56:01,469
Fuck this.

3489
02:56:02,270 --> 02:56:02,770
You know what?

3490
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:03,870
Fuck this.

3491
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:05,239
I'm taking the orb.

3492
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:09,180
Such an orb is a hugely powerful artifact.

3493
02:56:09,379 --> 02:56:11,680
If you could possess it, then all sorts of secrets might be yours.

3494
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:13,680
Not the least of spell lines for the North Gate.

3495
02:56:13,979 --> 02:56:15,479
Grab it and fucking run.

3496
02:56:15,479 --> 02:56:16,680
Orb, wait for an opportunity.

3497
02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:20,270
Wait for an opportunity.

3498
02:56:24,579 --> 02:56:25,280
No clue?

3499
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:25,979
Oh, whatever.

3500
02:56:25,979 --> 02:56:26,879
What was the clue anyways?

3501
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,379
Who cares?

3502
02:56:28,819 --> 02:56:29,319
I...

3503
02:56:30,059 --> 02:56:31,360
I'm not gonna get away with it.

3504
02:56:31,659 --> 02:56:32,860
Wait for an opportunity.

3505
02:56:35,739 --> 02:56:37,239
There are several of them and only one of you.

3506
02:56:37,239 --> 02:56:38,739
You'll have to pick your moment carefully.

3507
02:56:39,569 --> 02:56:40,270
Okay, wait.

3508
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:41,780
I'll hear my fortune.

3509
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:45,319
Okay, here we go.

3510
02:56:45,319 --> 02:56:45,620
Here we go.

3511
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:46,120
Here we go.

3512
02:56:46,719 --> 02:56:47,120
Take the...

3513
02:56:47,120 --> 02:56:47,819
Take the badge.

3514
02:56:54,479 --> 02:56:55,379
Okay, I found it.

3515
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:57,739
Wait and watch.

3516
02:57:01,159 --> 02:57:02,260
This is nonsense.

3517
02:57:05,850 --> 02:57:06,250
Here we go.

3518
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:07,520
Hold on.

3519
02:57:07,719 --> 02:57:08,920
Create a distraction.

3520
02:57:12,690 --> 02:57:14,290
She lifts her palm from the glass and smiles.

3521
02:57:14,290 --> 02:57:15,690
Someone gets her some pork to eat.

3522
02:57:15,690 --> 02:57:17,190
This is where I can get the orb.

3523
02:57:19,370 --> 02:57:19,870
Or...

3524
02:57:20,979 --> 02:57:21,680
Get the clue.

3525
02:57:28,750 --> 02:57:29,250
What do you think?

3526
02:57:30,110 --> 02:57:32,510
Is the clue more important than the orb?

3527
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:36,020
Distraction.

3528
02:57:36,819 --> 02:57:39,920
If you wish to steal the orb, you realize you will need to create a distraction.

3529
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:42,520
Kick over the fire.

3530
02:57:43,899 --> 02:57:46,000
Hold my sword to Cerise's throat.

3531
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:48,540
Point into the distance and shout.

3532
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:49,440
Or...

3533
02:57:55,579 --> 02:57:56,479
See...

3534
02:57:56,579 --> 02:57:57,780
Oh, we don't have it.

3535
02:58:00,889 --> 02:58:01,389
Dud.

3536
02:58:01,989 --> 02:58:03,090
Illusion of treasure.

3537
02:58:06,299 --> 02:58:06,799
Dose.

3538
02:58:06,799 --> 02:58:07,799
Cause slowness.

3539
02:58:07,899 --> 02:58:08,299
It could be...

3540
02:58:08,299 --> 02:58:09,000
It's probably that.

3541
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:14,360
Fog.

3542
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:15,360
Summon darkness.

3543
02:58:16,159 --> 02:58:17,260
Create a force field.

3544
02:58:21,819 --> 02:58:22,319
We don't have...

3545
02:58:22,319 --> 02:58:23,120
We can't do the smell.

3546
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:27,120
Fog.

3547
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:33,620
Dud might work really well.

3548
02:58:39,110 --> 02:58:40,209
They're poachers, right?

3549
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:49,159
If I put like treasure chests all over the place,

3550
02:58:49,659 --> 02:58:51,159
they're all going to be like, holy shit.

3551
02:58:51,760 --> 02:59:01,030
You cast the spell, summoning a pile of treasure from the mud.

3552
02:59:01,329 --> 02:59:03,729
The poachers' eyes grow wide in amazement.

3553
02:59:04,129 --> 02:59:05,729
And they begin to stuff their pockets.

3554
02:59:06,129 --> 02:59:09,329
Some are faster than others, but then the losers turn on their friends,

3555
02:59:09,530 --> 02:59:11,729
pulling knives, robbing them for their takings.

3556
02:59:12,030 --> 02:59:16,430
Within minutes, an almighty fight is waging over your imaginary gold.

3557
02:59:16,969 --> 02:59:22,670
In the fight, someone kicks the crystal orb and it strikes the brazier and shatters into a hundred thousand pieces.

3558
02:59:23,469 --> 02:59:25,370
A hundred thousand pieces?

3559
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:39,870
Fuck!

3560
02:59:39,969 --> 02:59:41,969
A hundred thousand pieces, dude.

3561
02:59:41,969 --> 02:59:42,469
All right, what?

3562
02:59:42,469 --> 02:59:43,170
A fog?

3563
02:59:44,170 --> 02:59:45,870
I want this fucking thing.

3564
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:46,469
I don't care.

3565
02:59:46,469 --> 02:59:48,569
I don't think I've ever had this orb at any playthrough.

3566
02:59:51,670 --> 02:59:52,870
I don't think I've ever had this before.

3567
02:59:54,569 --> 02:59:56,770
I know I'm throwing a bunch of rewinds.

3568
02:59:57,069 --> 02:59:58,270
But still, come on, man.

3569
02:59:58,270 --> 02:59:59,969
I want this thing so bad.

3570
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:01,739
I can see the future.

3571
03:00:01,739 --> 03:00:02,239
If I can...

3572
03:00:02,239 --> 03:00:06,139
Okay, imagine being able to read the future for like a manticore.

3573
03:00:06,139 --> 03:00:06,940
That's hilarious.

3574
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:07,540
I'm going to do it.

3575
03:00:10,860 --> 03:00:12,059
Did I have this last time?

3576
03:00:12,059 --> 03:00:12,860
I don't remember having this.

3577
03:00:19,229 --> 03:00:19,629
Okay.

3578
03:00:20,459 --> 03:00:21,260
Wait for an opportunity.

3579
03:00:21,959 --> 03:00:22,459
This is it.

3580
03:00:22,459 --> 03:00:23,360
I'll hear my fortune.

3581
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:24,540
Here you go.

3582
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,440
Here's the badge.

3583
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:28,940
Okay.

3584
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:30,239
I found this badge.

3585
03:00:30,239 --> 03:00:31,239
Wow, interesting.

3586
03:00:31,540 --> 03:00:32,340
Wait and watch.

3587
03:00:32,840 --> 03:00:33,440
Here we go.

3588
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:35,040
This is nonsense.

3589
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:36,239
You're a charlatan.

3590
03:00:36,639 --> 03:00:37,540
Distraction.

3591
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:38,440
Okay.

3592
03:00:50,860 --> 03:00:51,559
Will this work?

3593
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:55,940
Point and shout is so funny.

3594
03:01:15,530 --> 03:01:16,129
Darkness.

3595
03:01:17,569 --> 03:01:18,170
Horse field.

3596
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:21,719
Spoiler in mod chat if you want it.

3597
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:23,899
Wait, what?

3598
03:01:27,209 --> 03:01:28,110
Don't tell him.

3599
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:31,059
Don't look.

3600
03:01:31,059 --> 03:01:31,559
Don't look.

3601
03:01:31,559 --> 03:01:32,360
What do you mean don't look?

3602
03:01:37,799 --> 03:01:38,399
Slowness?

3603
03:01:41,420 --> 03:01:42,520
Slowness or darkness?

3604
03:01:42,520 --> 03:01:43,319
I think would be perfect.

3605
03:01:46,850 --> 03:01:47,149
Okay.

3606
03:01:47,149 --> 03:01:49,450
I'm going to say I'm going to say darkness, right?

3607
03:01:57,159 --> 03:01:57,760
Slow.

3608
03:01:58,860 --> 03:01:59,760
Slowness.

3609
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:07,520
You cast a spell slowing Cerise in particular down.

3610
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:09,620
You reach over and snatch the orb.

3611
03:02:09,620 --> 03:02:10,319
Success!

3612
03:02:11,049 --> 03:02:16,450
Cerise gives a slow motion cry like the groaning of a skunk bear.

3613
03:02:19,049 --> 03:02:21,549
The men look back and see you orb in hand.

3614
03:02:22,049 --> 03:02:25,950
The fist that catches you in the jaw is sudden unexpected and

3615
03:02:25,950 --> 03:02:27,450
extremely powerful.

3616
03:02:27,750 --> 03:02:32,049
The orb flies out of your hand and smashes into a million pieces

3617
03:02:32,350 --> 03:02:33,350
against the brazier.

3618
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:35,450
A million this time.

3619
03:02:35,750 --> 03:02:38,649
You run for your life chased by men with pokers.

3620
03:02:39,610 --> 03:02:40,909
A million, huh?

3621
03:02:41,450 --> 03:02:43,350
A fucking million this time.

3622
03:02:46,409 --> 03:02:47,309
I'm reading spoiler.

3623
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:50,819
Oh my fucking God.

3624
03:02:50,819 --> 03:02:52,719
Okay, that's oh my God.

3625
03:02:52,719 --> 03:02:53,719
I'm actually mad.

3626
03:02:55,790 --> 03:02:56,389
I'm mad.

3627
03:02:56,930 --> 03:02:57,629
I'm mad.

3628
03:02:57,629 --> 03:02:58,129
I'm mad.

3629
03:02:58,129 --> 03:02:58,629
I'm mad.

3630
03:02:58,629 --> 03:02:59,129
I'm mad.

3631
03:02:59,129 --> 03:02:59,530
I'm mad.

3632
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:00,229
I'm going to rewind.

3633
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:10,219
You cannot get the orb from them right now.

3634
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:13,819
If I can't as I've I can't get it right now.

3635
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:16,979
I've literally it's impossible.

3636
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:17,579
Okay.

3637
03:03:18,190 --> 03:03:25,510
So I may have I may have done things incorrectly going coming

3638
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:28,790
forward without items correctly to do this where I can't get

3639
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:30,290
it right now with my current items and stuff.

3640
03:03:33,069 --> 03:03:37,790
So we're going to get the clue that sucks.

3641
03:03:37,989 --> 03:03:42,670
Okay, I'm going to get the clue ask for some pig take some

3642
03:03:42,670 --> 03:03:43,170
pig.

3643
03:03:43,469 --> 03:03:48,090
That's so funny.

3644
03:03:48,590 --> 03:03:50,690
It smashes to a million faces.

3645
03:03:58,049 --> 03:03:58,950
That's hilarious.

3646
03:04:00,290 --> 03:04:02,590
Okay, my business is my own.

3647
03:04:03,319 --> 03:04:05,319
So I'm going to keep the badge then she's a fraud.

3648
03:04:05,719 --> 03:04:07,520
We look at I'm not going to rewind this many times.

3649
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:09,579
I promise ever again.

3650
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:13,000
I just really wanted the orb so bad.

3651
03:04:14,889 --> 03:04:15,889
You're a fortune teller.

3652
03:04:17,649 --> 03:04:21,770
I'll hear my fortune and I'm going to offer her gold piece.

3653
03:04:22,379 --> 03:04:24,579
I'm not going to leave the city's the Nobles badge.

3654
03:04:24,579 --> 03:04:29,250
I'm keeping there are people that still are debating on the

3655
03:04:29,350 --> 03:04:31,549
Wiki for this game on whether it's possible.

3656
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:35,139
What that's so funny.

3657
03:04:36,489 --> 03:04:38,989
Okay, I have nothing to give you.

3658
03:04:40,270 --> 03:04:43,790
Should I say that instead I did it.

3659
03:04:43,790 --> 03:04:44,889
It's actually possible.

3660
03:04:44,889 --> 03:04:53,059
Okay, whatever offer her gold piece you withdraw gold piece

3661
03:04:53,059 --> 03:04:54,659
from your purse and place it in her palm.

3662
03:04:54,860 --> 03:04:59,129
Perhaps this will do you say she shakes her head and laughs

3663
03:04:59,610 --> 03:05:01,409
silver is silver and gold is gold.

3664
03:05:01,409 --> 03:05:06,479
I'm sorry, but magic is as magic is because somebody lend me

3665
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:15,360
something perhaps someone can lend me something.

3666
03:05:16,569 --> 03:05:18,370
Poachers look around and begin to laugh.

3667
03:05:18,870 --> 03:05:22,360
It seems they think that your suggestion is a joke picking

3668
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:26,190
up her orb Cerise moves over to one of the other men who

3669
03:05:26,190 --> 03:05:30,159
hands her what looks like a silver tooth and then sits down

3670
03:05:30,159 --> 03:05:31,159
to hear his fortune.

3671
03:05:32,340 --> 03:05:35,629
She places her palms on the crystal and begins to hum doesn't

3672
03:05:35,629 --> 03:05:37,829
look like any fortune-telling spell you've ever heard about

3673
03:05:42,209 --> 03:05:44,510
a minute passes then Cerise's eyes flick open.

3674
03:05:45,409 --> 03:05:47,750
I see a long journey to a distant land.

3675
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:48,350
I see danger.

3676
03:05:48,350 --> 03:05:53,520
Wait, this is nonsense.

3677
03:05:54,479 --> 03:05:55,280
She's a charlatan.

3678
03:05:57,139 --> 03:06:02,139
Oh, I actually didn't she's doing the same routine.

3679
03:06:04,379 --> 03:06:05,879
I oh my god.

3680
03:06:05,879 --> 03:06:06,680
Imagine if we did.

3681
03:06:06,879 --> 03:06:07,180
Okay.

3682
03:06:07,180 --> 03:06:09,079
Imagine if I actually didn't give a shit and we just moved

3683
03:06:09,079 --> 03:06:11,780
on I would have been asking you guys about this for the

3684
03:06:11,780 --> 03:06:15,180
next like three hours a blind man.

3685
03:06:15,280 --> 03:06:16,479
Hey, this guy's a blind man.

3686
03:06:16,479 --> 03:06:17,680
He's going to stab us in the back.

3687
03:06:19,379 --> 03:06:20,280
I'll read your fortune.

3688
03:06:22,329 --> 03:06:23,129
I'm a sorcerer.

3689
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:29,200
Okay, so now I'm going to cast the spell we get the clue.

3690
03:06:29,399 --> 03:06:30,600
I get to keep the badge.

3691
03:06:35,399 --> 03:06:36,600
What are the what else can you do here?

3692
03:06:45,909 --> 03:06:47,190
Okay, here we go.

3693
03:06:47,190 --> 03:06:49,090
What is the answer to the question that has never been

3694
03:06:49,090 --> 03:06:49,590
asked?

3695
03:06:52,489 --> 03:06:55,809
Cerise you breathe in your vision.

3696
03:06:56,579 --> 03:06:58,379
I see your fortune.

3697
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:03,149
I see you losing several.

3698
03:07:03,250 --> 03:07:03,649
I see you.

3699
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:04,549
There's none of this matters.

3700
03:07:08,610 --> 03:07:10,510
I see you telling great fortunes.

3701
03:07:12,010 --> 03:07:12,709
Is that all?

3702
03:07:14,079 --> 03:07:16,079
I see you divulging a secret.

3703
03:07:17,899 --> 03:07:18,600
Wow.

3704
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:21,879
I'm fucking out of here by you make to slip away.

3705
03:07:23,090 --> 03:07:26,389
I have told great fortunes good ones Cerise continues sadly

3706
03:07:26,389 --> 03:07:27,690
but not true ones.

3707
03:07:28,489 --> 03:07:31,319
The poachers cannot believe their ears one denies it another

3708
03:07:31,319 --> 03:07:31,520
claim.

3709
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:32,420
Yeah, that was okay.

3710
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:38,620
Yeah, it doesn't matter that there is run for it.

3711
03:07:38,819 --> 03:07:40,319
It smashes, but I got the clue.

3712
03:07:40,319 --> 03:07:41,219
That's all that matters.

3713
03:07:41,219 --> 03:07:41,819
All right.

3714
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:45,319
So yeah, I lost for stamina for this whole fucking ordeal.

3715
03:07:45,319 --> 03:07:45,819
What was the clue?

3716
03:07:45,819 --> 03:07:55,000
Anyways in a vision you saw the answer to the question that

3717
03:07:55,000 --> 03:08:01,969
has never been asked Cerise interesting interesting

3718
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:06,170
interesting where we go and get a poll in the chat room

3719
03:08:06,170 --> 03:08:06,969
right now.

3720
03:08:06,969 --> 03:08:12,010
Are we going up or we going down show you what's up back

3721
03:08:12,010 --> 03:08:15,010
up this way towards Mansion Row and up to the artist quarter

3722
03:08:15,549 --> 03:08:22,719
potentially dwarf town or down downhill over here to this

3723
03:08:22,719 --> 03:08:25,620
farmstead and potentially the festival of thieves.

3724
03:08:28,750 --> 03:08:29,350
Where are we going?

3725
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:33,399
That's not one of the people is still debating on whether

3726
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:37,139
you can get this or not in like 40 years.

3727
03:08:42,670 --> 03:08:44,370
This crow is pissing me off.

3728
03:08:48,149 --> 03:08:48,549
Sorry.

3729
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:54,100
Up up down down down up up down down.

3730
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:54,799
Oh shit.

3731
03:08:54,799 --> 03:08:56,969
I got where my where to go.

3732
03:08:57,270 --> 03:09:10,209
Hey, hey, all right up or down up or down a pole is already

3733
03:09:10,209 --> 03:09:10,709
active.

3734
03:09:11,110 --> 03:09:19,090
Oh, I think a lot of people I use you.

3735
03:09:19,090 --> 03:09:20,389
Everyone's looking at dwarf town.

3736
03:09:20,389 --> 03:09:20,690
They're going.

3737
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:21,989
Oh, he's gonna go to dwarf town.

3738
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:28,239
All you you know, you all you jokers.

3739
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:44,440
It's definitely it's it's unanimous going up uphill.

3740
03:09:45,549 --> 03:09:49,579
Let's continue our class the road climbs between high

3741
03:09:49,579 --> 03:09:52,680
fences and then into open fields a little further on you

3742
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:56,819
see another rock face as Kare climbs another level or the

3743
03:09:56,819 --> 03:10:00,420
top of this one is a line of grand houses with ornamental

3744
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:02,719
roofs and pillared colonnades.

3745
03:10:05,340 --> 03:10:08,479
This is where the richer creatures of Kare live looking

3746
03:10:08,479 --> 03:10:11,879
down across the field day on you can imagine them sipping

3747
03:10:11,879 --> 03:10:15,079
iron wine on their balconies and watching the toil of the

3748
03:10:15,079 --> 03:10:16,780
farm workers through a spyglass.

3749
03:10:17,579 --> 03:10:20,149
But the more you look the more you realize something is

3750
03:10:20,149 --> 03:10:20,649
wrong.

3751
03:10:21,350 --> 03:10:24,860
A tree grows from one roof another has slipped sideways

3752
03:10:24,860 --> 03:10:26,559
into the yard of the neighboring house.

3753
03:10:27,319 --> 03:10:30,700
These places are falling into ruin you knew Kare was poor

3754
03:10:30,700 --> 03:10:43,170
but this is worse than you'd ever heard a junction the road

3755
03:10:43,170 --> 03:10:46,069
carries on rising very slightly through thin and meager

3756
03:10:46,069 --> 03:10:50,879
fields scarecrows made from skeletons hang from posts on

3757
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:53,680
either side their bones rattling in the breeze.

3758
03:10:54,450 --> 03:10:57,440
There is no one about with the hottest part of the day

3759
03:10:57,440 --> 03:11:01,840
approaching you reach a crossroads of sorts to the right

3760
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:05,139
of the main road a track lined with colored flags leads along

3761
03:11:05,139 --> 03:11:08,430
the line of a cliff short distance from the road is a small

3762
03:11:08,430 --> 03:11:12,030
hut built from mud bricks smoke rises from the chimney

3763
03:11:12,430 --> 03:11:14,930
and a thick rich smell wafts from its door.

3764
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:18,959
If it is a shop it can't catch they can't have much to

3765
03:11:18,959 --> 03:11:21,360
trade stuck out here in the middle of the fields.

3766
03:11:23,979 --> 03:11:34,879
Oh well, well one two or three one two or three one is

3767
03:11:34,879 --> 03:11:37,079
just take the main road up through into the artist's

3768
03:11:37,079 --> 03:11:42,350
quarter who is to enter the small hut which I think we

3769
03:11:42,350 --> 03:11:47,479
can do anyways, but we may lose the opportunity to go this

3770
03:11:47,479 --> 03:11:47,780
way.

3771
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:56,959
I'm not sure one two or three main road and solidify that

3772
03:11:56,959 --> 03:12:01,299
we can actually go that way go into the hut and you know

3773
03:12:01,299 --> 03:12:05,110
do whatever is going to happen in here or add to the flags

3774
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:06,809
heading down towards what I'm imagining.

3775
03:12:06,809 --> 03:12:08,309
This is probably the others in the festival thieves down

3776
03:12:08,309 --> 03:12:11,579
here or maybe not, but I you know, obviously going to give

3777
03:12:11,579 --> 03:12:14,180
you the opportunity because who knows if we can do this

3778
03:12:14,180 --> 03:12:20,280
after we do one of these there's no way to tell one two

3779
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:30,559
three is it right gang or left gang?

3780
03:12:32,219 --> 03:12:33,920
Um, why do you have the stream muted?

3781
03:12:37,659 --> 03:12:38,459
That's my question.

3782
03:12:38,459 --> 03:12:48,159
This whole thing has been me like reading an audiobook immediately

3783
03:12:48,159 --> 03:12:50,559
after you said dwarf town and had did a creepy laugh.

3784
03:12:50,559 --> 03:12:51,659
My computer blue-screened.

3785
03:12:52,319 --> 03:12:57,690
Well, that's I'm sorry going in the hut the door to the

3786
03:12:57,690 --> 03:13:01,190
small hut is a little ajar a pleasant smell it drifts out

3787
03:13:01,489 --> 03:13:02,690
but you hear nothing from inside.

3788
03:13:08,200 --> 03:13:08,700
Let's knock.

3789
03:13:09,440 --> 03:13:09,940
Okay.

3790
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:14,319
Hello, you knock firmly on the door a voice calls back enter

3791
03:13:14,319 --> 03:13:16,319
friend, but be careful as you open the door.

3792
03:13:18,540 --> 03:13:31,350
I don't get a shit just shove it open shove the door open.

3793
03:13:31,549 --> 03:13:32,950
What is going on in here?

3794
03:13:32,950 --> 03:13:36,350
Okay, you give the door quick shove and something a jar of

3795
03:13:36,350 --> 03:13:38,850
some liquid drops from the door frame and smashes on the

3796
03:13:38,850 --> 03:13:39,350
floor.

3797
03:13:39,950 --> 03:13:40,750
There it is.

3798
03:13:41,149 --> 03:13:46,700
How well the shop is a kitchen.

3799
03:13:47,370 --> 03:13:50,340
There is a fire in the great with a pot above it which

3800
03:13:50,340 --> 03:13:54,329
bubbles and smokes on the walls hang herbs vegetables meats

3801
03:13:54,329 --> 03:13:55,229
and cooking equipment.

3802
03:13:55,989 --> 03:13:58,190
But no matter how hard you look you cannot seem to see the

3803
03:13:58,190 --> 03:14:16,120
speaker right here, right or is that I don't understand look

3804
03:14:16,120 --> 03:14:20,469
under the table look near the hearth I'm gonna look at the

3805
03:14:20,469 --> 03:14:22,579
hearth looking again.

3806
03:14:22,579 --> 03:14:24,780
You suddenly notice the strange looking creature standing

3807
03:14:24,780 --> 03:14:25,680
beside the pot.

3808
03:14:26,379 --> 03:14:27,180
Wait, hold on.

3809
03:14:28,799 --> 03:14:31,600
He has a human torso, but his head is nothing but a green

3810
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:32,600
colored jelly.

3811
03:14:34,100 --> 03:14:36,299
He's hard to spot because of the vegetables hanging on the

3812
03:14:36,299 --> 03:14:40,799
wall behind him, but you can tell he's the chef as the long

3813
03:14:41,100 --> 03:14:44,399
sinuous tentacles come from his head are scooping with

3814
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:47,600
ladles stirring with spoons waving salt shakers and

3815
03:14:47,600 --> 03:14:48,600
brandishing a cleaver.

3816
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:53,430
What do you want?

3817
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:58,309
Ask the creature get over here.

3818
03:15:02,590 --> 03:15:06,110
Look around more closely talk to the creature be nice be

3819
03:15:06,110 --> 03:15:14,819
nice be nice greetings creature.

3820
03:15:18,079 --> 03:15:19,079
I don't have all day.

3821
03:15:20,219 --> 03:15:21,120
What do you want?

3822
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:24,399
The creature complains its tentacles go back to stirring

3823
03:15:25,829 --> 03:15:26,729
chopping and mixing.

3824
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:28,680
This is a robbery.

3825
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:30,120
I'd like to buy some food.

3826
03:15:36,069 --> 03:15:37,370
We actually might be able to get away with it.

3827
03:15:39,379 --> 03:15:42,559
I mean look this is just one hut out in the middle of

3828
03:15:42,559 --> 03:15:43,159
nowhere.

3829
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:46,840
This is a robbery.

3830
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:52,149
I mean I could probably kick this guy's ass.

3831
03:15:57,389 --> 03:15:58,889
He's pretty rude to by the way.

3832
03:16:00,860 --> 03:16:01,659
What do you want?

3833
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:02,559
Oh greetings.

3834
03:16:02,659 --> 03:16:03,959
Look I don't have all day.

3835
03:16:05,239 --> 03:16:11,520
Be a viewer a little more cordial be nice be nice.

3836
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:12,319
I have 24 gold.

3837
03:16:12,319 --> 03:16:12,620
Yeah.

3838
03:16:12,620 --> 03:16:13,719
Do I want to all right?

3839
03:16:13,719 --> 03:16:13,920
Okay.

3840
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:19,579
I'd like to buy no I didn't mean to do that.

3841
03:16:29,469 --> 03:16:30,270
No fuck.

3842
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:39,540
I don't I barged I barged right in you step through the

3843
03:16:39,540 --> 03:16:41,540
doorframe something falls on your head with a crack and

3844
03:16:41,540 --> 03:16:43,540
an oily liquid begins to ooze down the side of your

3845
03:16:43,540 --> 03:16:44,040
face.

3846
03:16:44,520 --> 03:16:46,520
I barged in last time wipe it off.

3847
03:16:47,340 --> 03:16:50,219
You lift a hand to your head to wipe the liquid away,

3848
03:16:50,219 --> 03:16:52,719
but as you do you feel tops of your hair coming out of

3849
03:16:52,719 --> 03:16:56,069
your palm what from across the hut of voice.

3850
03:16:57,920 --> 03:17:00,360
So if you're right intruder you should have been more

3851
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:04,760
cautious, but I was wondering where I left that

3852
03:17:04,760 --> 03:17:07,379
potion of baldness reaching up.

3853
03:17:07,379 --> 03:17:08,180
You realize it's true.

3854
03:17:08,180 --> 03:17:10,879
Your head is now a bald scalp and even your eyebrows

3855
03:17:10,879 --> 03:17:11,479
have come off.

3856
03:17:22,760 --> 03:17:24,559
You laugh and so does the creature on the other side

3857
03:17:24,559 --> 03:17:26,500
of the room is a strange looking thing.

3858
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:28,399
The creature has a human torso and his head is nothing

3859
03:17:28,399 --> 03:17:29,899
but a green jelly or whatever.

3860
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:34,840
All right.

3861
03:17:34,940 --> 03:17:35,940
Talk to the creature.

3862
03:17:37,530 --> 03:17:38,030
Okay.

3863
03:17:38,030 --> 03:17:39,629
I'd like to buy some food.

3864
03:17:40,559 --> 03:17:41,959
I'd like to buy some food.

3865
03:17:43,549 --> 03:17:44,049
All right.

3866
03:17:45,170 --> 03:17:48,170
It's five gold pieces and it's bristlebeast kidneys.

3867
03:17:48,569 --> 03:17:52,649
Hope that's all right with you giving his cauldron a

3868
03:17:52,649 --> 03:17:57,229
quick stir, but never taking his eyes off you only

3869
03:17:57,229 --> 03:18:02,510
one piece of food pay him attack him.

3870
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:03,309
That's too much.

3871
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:11,010
I mean, I'm I that's too much right, but sometimes

3872
03:18:11,010 --> 03:18:12,209
bartering doesn't work.

3873
03:18:12,209 --> 03:18:16,280
Sometimes I'm just going to pay him because a lot of

3874
03:18:16,280 --> 03:18:20,200
times they'll go fine leave and I'm not rewinding for

3875
03:18:20,200 --> 03:18:21,399
bullshit reasons anymore.

3876
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:26,120
I'm paying you pay him the money and he hands you a

3877
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:29,459
bowl of stew doesn't taste very nice, but you force a

3878
03:18:29,459 --> 03:18:32,360
smile the creature nods and offers you a drink to

3879
03:18:32,360 --> 03:18:35,760
help wash it down spill it to create a distraction.

3880
03:18:40,549 --> 03:18:43,899
Try drink this this guy's got weird potions everywhere

3881
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:50,500
game really wants you to rob this guy.

3882
03:18:50,500 --> 03:18:54,700
Yeah, why drink it you drink it down.

3883
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:57,100
It's actually quite refreshing with you meal finished.

3884
03:18:57,100 --> 03:18:58,299
There's not much more to be done.

3885
03:18:58,299 --> 03:18:59,299
You're hunger satisfied.

3886
03:18:59,299 --> 03:19:01,700
You thank the cleaning creature and leave the hut.

3887
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:07,200
Okay, I don't know what happens if you attack him

3888
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:08,799
or rob him.

3889
03:19:14,690 --> 03:19:17,040
All right one or two.

3890
03:19:19,299 --> 03:19:20,399
I have bald head now.

3891
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:27,379
Whatever I'll zoom out.

3892
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:30,799
You can see the potential route that you'll be taking

3893
03:19:37,260 --> 03:19:39,799
what happens it is that you're a mean person.

3894
03:19:44,040 --> 03:19:45,440
I mean, I'm not a mean person.

3895
03:19:47,059 --> 03:19:49,700
I'm I'm I'm an adventurer.

3896
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:57,409
We'd make our decisions on the fly as they happen to

3897
03:19:57,409 --> 03:19:59,209
is to come down to the festival thieves and whatever

3898
03:19:59,209 --> 03:19:59,909
is up here.

3899
03:20:00,010 --> 03:20:02,850
Whatever this is one is to head up towards the artist

3900
03:20:02,850 --> 03:20:10,809
quarter and Dwarftown bald, you know, it's really funny.

3901
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:13,879
The game is going to remember that and there's going

3902
03:20:13,879 --> 03:20:15,780
to be tons of lines through the rest of the game that

3903
03:20:15,780 --> 03:20:18,780
say it really grazes over your bald head.

3904
03:20:18,879 --> 03:20:20,780
That's going to be there now forever or whatever.

3905
03:20:23,840 --> 03:20:26,540
Oh, you feel the breeze on your bare scalp.

3906
03:20:26,639 --> 03:20:28,340
We're going to read shit like that every 10 minutes

3907
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:28,639
now.

3908
03:20:37,590 --> 03:20:38,090
All right.

3909
03:20:38,190 --> 03:20:38,989
This is a major decision.

3910
03:20:38,989 --> 03:20:41,299
Which way we going one?

3911
03:20:41,299 --> 03:20:46,340
Okay, not by a lot up through Mansion Row artist

3912
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:47,340
quarter Dwarftown.

3913
03:20:47,340 --> 03:20:56,239
You follow the road up a slight rise and then down

3914
03:20:56,239 --> 03:20:59,500
into a hollow at the very bottom as a solitary thatched

3915
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:09,229
hut the curious wispy statue outside in the distance

3916
03:21:09,229 --> 03:21:12,329
the road rises once more was a large building with

3917
03:21:12,329 --> 03:21:13,430
a domed roof.

3918
03:21:16,879 --> 03:21:19,079
Examine the statue examine the hut make a move cast

3919
03:21:19,079 --> 03:21:19,780
a spell.

3920
03:21:28,770 --> 03:21:32,229
Sauce is a good option here magic protection.

3921
03:21:32,229 --> 03:21:33,629
Obviously is the thing here.

3922
03:21:35,219 --> 03:21:44,799
Huff wind is also this is a hot is also Goblin.

3923
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:46,260
Huh?

3924
03:21:48,729 --> 03:21:50,430
I could just send I got a lot of teeth.

3925
03:21:52,299 --> 03:21:54,200
This doesn't take any stamina.

3926
03:21:54,899 --> 03:22:00,469
Go toss down a Goblin's tooth and cast your spell.

3927
03:22:00,469 --> 03:22:02,969
There's a thin wisp of smoke and then a column of

3928
03:22:02,969 --> 03:22:05,870
fire and then from the flames a Goblin warrior

3929
03:22:05,870 --> 03:22:07,870
emerges to give you a jaunty salute.

3930
03:22:08,729 --> 03:22:11,829
He looks about for someone to fight but sees no

3931
03:22:11,829 --> 03:22:15,209
immediate threat send him in the hut sent into the

3932
03:22:15,209 --> 03:22:20,829
statue send him over to the statue you direct him

3933
03:22:20,829 --> 03:22:21,729
over to the statue.

3934
03:22:22,430 --> 03:22:25,530
He approaches casually and then quite suddenly the

3935
03:22:25,530 --> 03:22:29,329
statue moves its arms slicing through the air one

3936
03:22:29,329 --> 03:22:32,430
cutting through the Goblin at head height the next

3937
03:22:32,430 --> 03:22:35,270
at knee level the poor creature drops to the ground

3938
03:22:35,270 --> 03:22:39,020
in three pieces a moment later it vanishes in a

3939
03:22:39,020 --> 03:22:41,319
plume of smoke and when the smoke has disappeared

3940
03:22:41,319 --> 03:22:44,120
you see nothing but the statue standing just as

3941
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:44,719
before.

3942
03:22:45,510 --> 03:22:46,909
Did you imagine it moving?

3943
03:22:47,209 --> 03:22:48,110
Holy shit.

3944
03:22:57,479 --> 03:22:59,020
Oh poor guy.

3945
03:23:00,430 --> 03:23:00,829
Okay.

3946
03:23:00,829 --> 03:23:01,229
Well,

3947
03:23:03,250 --> 03:23:04,549
this is gonna cut me in three pieces.

3948
03:23:07,170 --> 03:23:10,700
I'll just do it but what if it kills me I get a

3949
03:23:10,700 --> 03:23:11,299
free rewind.

3950
03:23:13,639 --> 03:23:16,639
The statue depicts a man of sorts with long and

3951
03:23:16,639 --> 03:23:20,870
spiny limbs sharp edged and cruel its hands are

3952
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:23,540
pressed together before its body as though in

3953
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:26,840
prayer to one of Kare's many gods around its neck

3954
03:23:27,139 --> 03:23:29,440
hangs a locket of what looks like solid gold.

3955
03:23:29,540 --> 03:23:38,040
Okay examine the hut the hut behind was thrown up

3956
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:41,040
in a hurry its walls are patched with mud and clay

3957
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:44,629
and the door is made from torn up fish crates the

3958
03:23:44,629 --> 03:23:47,129
planks still bearing the marks of the ships that

3959
03:23:47,129 --> 03:23:50,190
brought them in the statue suggests this could be

3960
03:23:50,190 --> 03:23:53,459
a shrine but you do not recognize the deity.

3961
03:23:58,030 --> 03:24:03,430
I mean he got cut into three pieces free rewind

3962
03:24:03,430 --> 03:24:05,530
they're all free now feels weird man.

3963
03:24:05,530 --> 03:24:11,899
Oh no one out pizzas the hut talking about stuff

3964
03:24:11,899 --> 03:24:21,659
crust pizza that is you approach the statue curiously

3965
03:24:21,659 --> 03:24:22,059
up close.

3966
03:24:22,059 --> 03:24:23,059
It's even more ugly.

3967
03:24:23,360 --> 03:24:25,459
The limbs are as thin as sticks but as sharp as

3968
03:24:25,459 --> 03:24:26,159
sword blades.

3969
03:24:26,899 --> 03:24:28,799
The only beautiful thing about is the gold locket

3970
03:24:28,799 --> 03:24:30,000
that hangs around its neck.

3971
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:36,209
You hang back for a moment to watch the statue.

3972
03:24:36,209 --> 03:24:38,110
That's when you see the statue blink.

3973
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:40,209
That's terrifying.

3974
03:24:43,399 --> 03:24:49,159
Keep watching you stand transfixed waiting to see

3975
03:24:49,159 --> 03:24:52,200
if the statue will move again to be sure it was not

3976
03:24:52,200 --> 03:24:52,899
your imagination.

3977
03:24:52,899 --> 03:24:56,000
It blinks again and then the arms move one sword

3978
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:57,899
like edge sharpening itself against the other.

3979
03:25:04,780 --> 03:25:07,979
We just watched this cut our friend into three pieces.

3980
03:25:09,690 --> 03:25:10,290
Yep.

3981
03:25:11,450 --> 03:25:12,750
Talk with animals.

3982
03:25:15,790 --> 03:25:25,639
Oh shit, but is this the offer?

3983
03:25:25,739 --> 03:25:27,040
It's like a Resident Evil game guys.

3984
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:29,040
I don't shoot the rocket launcher until the last

3985
03:25:29,540 --> 03:25:30,840
right before the credits roll.

3986
03:25:32,450 --> 03:25:33,350
Daph is available.

3987
03:25:37,170 --> 03:25:49,299
Shield is available kid create an illusion summon

3988
03:25:49,299 --> 03:25:50,700
a replica creature.

3989
03:25:55,719 --> 03:26:03,270
Ah speed speeds probably at one of the ways to get

3990
03:26:03,270 --> 03:26:03,469
it.

3991
03:26:06,399 --> 03:26:07,799
I don't know if his app is going to do anything.

3992
03:26:11,840 --> 03:26:12,440
I don't know.

3993
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:17,079
It's probably walk create a shield.

3994
03:26:17,879 --> 03:26:18,879
Can I maybe I can block it.

3995
03:26:19,079 --> 03:26:20,680
I hold the shield up with it boom.

3996
03:26:27,260 --> 03:26:27,959
I'm going for it.

3997
03:26:30,739 --> 03:26:31,840
Oh my goodness.

3998
03:26:40,459 --> 03:26:41,959
You place a gold piece on your wrist and cast your

3999
03:26:41,959 --> 03:26:42,959
spell creating a shield.

4000
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:45,000
You ready blade the creature is not strong, but

4001
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:47,000
it's blade like arms are quite deadly.

4002
03:26:47,479 --> 03:26:50,180
You would do well to avoid even a single blow.

4003
03:26:56,219 --> 03:26:57,620
All right, we're going full blaster.

4004
03:27:01,110 --> 03:27:03,510
The statue slashes its razor blade arms through the

4005
03:27:03,510 --> 03:27:03,809
air.

4006
03:27:03,809 --> 03:27:04,809
It tries to scratch you.

4007
03:27:05,209 --> 03:27:07,409
You raise your sword and aim to carve the thing in

4008
03:27:07,409 --> 03:27:07,809
two.

4009
03:27:08,409 --> 03:27:11,579
You land a simple blow creatures losing its spines,

4010
03:27:11,579 --> 03:27:14,280
but it keeps coming the mantis man's long spines

4011
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:14,879
stretch.

4012
03:27:20,350 --> 03:27:21,149
I have to defend her.

4013
03:27:22,520 --> 03:27:22,819
Yep.

4014
03:27:24,010 --> 03:27:24,709
Ow.

4015
03:27:24,809 --> 03:27:25,510
Oh my God.

4016
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:26,010
That hurts.

4017
03:27:26,950 --> 03:27:31,389
That's with defending that's with a shield and

4018
03:27:31,389 --> 03:27:36,200
defending by the way raising your shield to

4019
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:37,500
protect your body as much as possible.

4020
03:27:37,500 --> 03:27:40,299
The mantis man dashes forward bounding across the

4021
03:27:40,299 --> 03:27:40,600
dirt.

4022
03:27:40,600 --> 03:27:42,899
You fall over yourself trying to escape its reach.

4023
03:27:49,940 --> 03:27:55,829
Okay, you aim a blow for its bug eyes as the mantis

4024
03:27:55,829 --> 03:27:58,229
man eyes turn briefly dark at Francis Ford.

4025
03:27:58,329 --> 03:27:58,930
Can I do it?

4026
03:28:00,850 --> 03:28:04,459
Yeah, I don't think I don't think I can do it.

4027
03:28:04,459 --> 03:28:09,950
I can and then again full blast it jumps towards

4028
03:28:09,950 --> 03:28:10,649
you full blast.

4029
03:28:11,350 --> 03:28:11,750
Got it.

4030
03:28:12,149 --> 03:28:12,549
We're good.

4031
03:28:14,399 --> 03:28:16,100
Your sword cleaves piece after piece from the

4032
03:28:16,100 --> 03:28:16,899
creature's side.

4033
03:28:16,899 --> 03:28:18,000
You slice for the statue.

4034
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:21,000
You hear that that was like then your blade lands

4035
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:21,299
deep.

4036
03:28:21,299 --> 03:28:24,139
You cut again twist and the mantis man collapses

4037
03:28:24,139 --> 03:28:24,739
into dirt.

4038
03:28:25,889 --> 03:28:28,959
With the mantis man defeated the street falls quiet

4039
03:28:28,959 --> 03:28:29,559
once more.

4040
03:28:29,559 --> 03:28:33,639
What do we got with the danger past you go over to

4041
03:28:33,639 --> 03:28:34,940
the creature and search it quickly.

4042
03:28:35,680 --> 03:28:37,680
The only thing of interest is the locket.

4043
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:40,549
You saw around its neck which turns out to be a

4044
03:28:40,549 --> 03:28:41,649
Sun Jewel.

4045
03:28:42,319 --> 03:28:45,020
You pocket it time to get away from this place.

4046
03:28:48,239 --> 03:28:48,639
Hold on.

4047
03:28:49,780 --> 03:29:06,110
I think I can the spell may only be cast upon the

4048
03:29:06,110 --> 03:29:10,180
yellow Sun Jewel once cast the Jewel will glow

4049
03:29:10,579 --> 03:29:13,579
either brilliantly to dazzle attacking creatures

4050
03:29:13,579 --> 03:29:15,879
or just light enough to act as a torch.

4051
03:29:20,200 --> 03:29:20,799
Interesting.

4052
03:29:22,639 --> 03:29:23,540
So it's a flashlight.

4053
03:29:24,569 --> 03:29:25,069
That's cool.

4054
03:29:28,840 --> 03:29:29,540
That's cool.

4055
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:33,620
You know how many times it's just complete pitch

4056
03:29:33,620 --> 03:29:34,719
black and I can't see anything.

4057
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:37,559
All right, we're going to go in this hut because I

4058
03:29:37,559 --> 03:29:37,959
want to.

4059
03:29:41,090 --> 03:29:42,190
Yeah, it's fucking starlight kid.

4060
03:29:42,190 --> 03:29:42,590
Come on.

4061
03:29:44,479 --> 03:29:45,879
You step inside the shadowy hut.

4062
03:29:45,879 --> 03:29:48,280
The first thing you notice is the smell thick and

4063
03:29:48,280 --> 03:29:50,180
bloody like a butcher shop.

4064
03:29:50,920 --> 03:29:53,719
Second thing is something that you kick that rattles

4065
03:29:53,719 --> 03:29:56,420
away across the floor and arm bone.

4066
03:29:58,139 --> 03:30:08,129
Reborn you pick up the bone.

4067
03:30:08,129 --> 03:30:08,629
It is human.

4068
03:30:08,629 --> 03:30:10,129
All right, and there are teeth marks.

4069
03:30:17,629 --> 03:30:19,229
I think I get you call out here.

4070
03:30:19,229 --> 03:30:24,079
Do you search through the bones you pick through a

4071
03:30:24,079 --> 03:30:28,219
few more bones male female child a few different

4072
03:30:28,219 --> 03:30:31,420
creatures not many but all mixed up in one corner.

4073
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:33,420
You find a number of knuckle bones that have been

4074
03:30:33,420 --> 03:30:35,520
strung together into a morbid bracelet.

4075
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:41,940
Take it you take the bracelet and put it on trying

4076
03:30:41,940 --> 03:30:44,139
not to imagine that a skeletal hand is gripping

4077
03:30:44,139 --> 03:30:47,600
your arm a little sickly light trickles in through

4078
03:30:47,600 --> 03:30:48,299
the windows.

4079
03:30:49,959 --> 03:30:50,459
What's that?

4080
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:56,360
What I just get bracelet of bone.

4081
03:30:56,360 --> 03:30:57,059
That's another one.

4082
03:30:59,950 --> 03:31:00,649
What's that do?

4083
03:31:01,959 --> 03:31:02,959
Oh shit right here.

4084
03:31:05,239 --> 03:31:08,040
Well wearing a bracelet of bone castor of the spell

4085
03:31:08,040 --> 03:31:10,440
can concentrate on a particular illusion.

4086
03:31:11,219 --> 03:31:13,120
This illusion will become real to others.

4087
03:31:13,819 --> 03:31:16,420
However, affected creatures must be intelligent

4088
03:31:16,420 --> 03:31:19,219
and the caster must not act counter to the illusion

4089
03:31:19,719 --> 03:31:21,120
so I can pretend to be somebody else.

4090
03:31:28,799 --> 03:31:29,399
That's cool.

4091
03:31:33,239 --> 03:31:34,739
That's two new spells back to back.

4092
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:35,840
Let's go.

4093
03:31:39,100 --> 03:31:43,860
I probably should be careful here because I'm going

4094
03:31:43,860 --> 03:31:48,280
to call out who's there.

4095
03:31:48,950 --> 03:31:49,850
I'm armed.

4096
03:31:51,350 --> 03:31:53,250
There's no reply the Hutta at least appears to be

4097
03:31:53,250 --> 03:31:56,219
empty shadow falls across the doorway of the hut

4098
03:31:56,219 --> 03:31:57,020
just for a moment.

4099
03:32:01,659 --> 03:32:03,760
You search you look around the other corners of

4100
03:32:03,760 --> 03:32:04,159
the hut.

4101
03:32:04,799 --> 03:32:07,700
There are a few piles of ragged clothing presumably

4102
03:32:07,700 --> 03:32:09,100
torn from the victims bodies.

4103
03:32:11,940 --> 03:32:18,590
Yikes that acting what what I called out as if I

4104
03:32:18,590 --> 03:32:20,290
was back home from school.

4105
03:32:20,829 --> 03:32:22,930
Hey mom, I'm back home from school.

4106
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:27,799
I feel like I need to get out of here.

4107
03:32:28,659 --> 03:32:32,579
Search clothes digging through the pile of clothes.

4108
03:32:32,579 --> 03:32:34,479
You unearth five gold pieces.

4109
03:32:34,579 --> 03:32:37,620
What this place is disgusting.

4110
03:32:37,620 --> 03:32:38,520
You turn and get out.

4111
03:32:38,719 --> 03:32:39,420
Oh my God.

4112
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:40,520
I got everything.

4113
03:32:45,389 --> 03:32:46,590
Did I do that in the right order?

4114
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:51,219
You step outside the hut onto the street grateful

4115
03:32:51,219 --> 03:32:52,420
for the relatively fresh air.

4116
03:32:58,750 --> 03:32:59,549
All right, let's keep going.

4117
03:33:04,860 --> 03:33:05,659
I need to sleep.

4118
03:33:06,260 --> 03:33:06,760
It's getting there.

4119
03:33:06,760 --> 03:33:10,399
Yeah, the road leaves the fields heading back

4120
03:33:10,399 --> 03:33:13,069
between buildings once more to the left.

4121
03:33:13,270 --> 03:33:15,469
A short track leads away and you hear distant

4122
03:33:15,469 --> 03:33:20,299
sounds of chanting a squat building at the end

4123
03:33:20,299 --> 03:33:22,700
of the track sits in a patch of neatly tiled

4124
03:33:23,200 --> 03:33:23,799
field.

4125
03:33:24,379 --> 03:33:26,479
You make out a few figures in bright orange robes

4126
03:33:26,479 --> 03:33:31,569
working outside all the track the domed building

4127
03:33:33,719 --> 03:33:40,219
one to one to big domed building or people in

4128
03:33:41,120 --> 03:33:46,399
what was it to say aren't orange robes people

4129
03:33:46,399 --> 03:33:48,700
and bright orange robes working outside.

4130
03:33:50,750 --> 03:33:55,040
We want to go I imagine this is probably going

4131
03:33:55,040 --> 03:34:00,180
to take us through here and maybe up this way

4132
03:34:02,459 --> 03:34:02,860
one.

4133
03:34:03,159 --> 03:34:06,680
Wait, what did I say was one in one of the mods

4134
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:06,979
helped me.

4135
03:34:06,979 --> 03:34:13,030
What did I just say was one and two one was the

4136
03:34:13,030 --> 03:34:13,430
dome.

4137
03:34:14,129 --> 03:34:18,139
Wait, I don't remember going over here.

4138
03:34:24,280 --> 03:34:26,379
The short track ends in a low building surrounded

4139
03:34:26,379 --> 03:34:27,780
by figures in long robes.

4140
03:34:28,079 --> 03:34:31,010
They are monks a few work the fields around the

4141
03:34:31,010 --> 03:34:33,209
building while others sit in contemplation

4142
03:34:33,209 --> 03:34:35,809
of the sky the wrinkles on their hands or the

4143
03:34:35,809 --> 03:34:38,770
soles of their feet one monk greets you with a

4144
03:34:38,770 --> 03:34:39,569
nod of his head.

4145
03:34:40,110 --> 03:34:42,879
You step past him to enter the monastery but the

4146
03:34:42,879 --> 03:34:44,579
monk reaches out and takes your arm.

4147
03:34:45,989 --> 03:34:49,850
You are forbidden my apologies, but strangers are

4148
03:34:49,850 --> 03:34:54,000
not allowed inside my apologies.

4149
03:34:54,100 --> 03:34:55,000
Let go of me.

4150
03:34:55,100 --> 03:35:01,030
I go where I please my apologies.

4151
03:35:02,209 --> 03:35:05,209
You reply bowing your head the monk smiles.

4152
03:35:05,940 --> 03:35:08,959
Welcome to our humble monastery and puts his

4153
03:35:08,959 --> 03:35:13,059
palms together and nods friend sit down beside

4154
03:35:13,059 --> 03:35:16,790
me and we will talk the monk pulls out a set of

4155
03:35:16,790 --> 03:35:19,190
knuckle bones and lays them on the bench

4156
03:35:19,489 --> 03:35:20,389
swindle stone.

4157
03:35:23,639 --> 03:35:25,139
Did I play or ask for help?

4158
03:35:25,540 --> 03:35:28,899
Let's play swindle stones.

4159
03:35:29,629 --> 03:35:32,409
The monk nods a game.

4160
03:35:32,809 --> 03:35:35,110
I have contemplated for a long time within these

4161
03:35:35,110 --> 03:35:35,709
walls.

4162
03:35:37,079 --> 03:35:38,979
He indicates the knuckle bones eagerly.

4163
03:35:39,280 --> 03:35:42,739
What's the steak the monk smiles.

4164
03:35:43,139 --> 03:35:46,840
I am a monk in case you did not notice I offer

4165
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:49,010
nothing and ask nothing.

4166
03:35:50,489 --> 03:35:52,489
I only play for money.

4167
03:35:57,129 --> 03:35:57,629
All right.

4168
03:35:58,680 --> 03:36:00,280
The monk hands you your dice and waves at you to

4169
03:36:00,280 --> 03:36:02,200
bid all the day.

4170
03:36:06,899 --> 03:36:08,200
Let me see.

4171
03:36:12,059 --> 03:36:15,040
Let's start with 114.

4172
03:36:16,610 --> 03:36:17,309
Maybe you could help me.

4173
03:36:17,309 --> 03:36:18,610
I'm traveling to the North Gate.

4174
03:36:20,170 --> 03:36:22,770
Ah, so you seek the four spell lines to unlock

4175
03:36:22,770 --> 03:36:23,270
the gate.

4176
03:36:25,569 --> 03:36:28,690
Can you tell me any of the lines to ones?

4177
03:36:28,989 --> 03:36:29,190
Okay.

4178
03:36:29,190 --> 03:36:30,389
That means he has to have two ones.

4179
03:36:30,790 --> 03:36:38,170
I'm going to say three ones to find the lines.

4180
03:36:38,569 --> 03:36:41,670
You must find the nobles and that will be difficult.

4181
03:36:43,860 --> 03:36:44,260
Dude.

4182
03:36:44,360 --> 03:36:45,559
Yeah, you call this.

4183
03:36:48,569 --> 03:36:49,270
I will manage.

4184
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:52,180
Holy shit.

4185
03:36:53,680 --> 03:36:54,780
He almost had four ones.

4186
03:36:55,620 --> 03:36:57,879
If I had even had one one that would have been

4187
03:36:57,879 --> 03:36:58,180
bad.

4188
03:36:58,180 --> 03:37:06,379
Okay, if you are truly determined to find the

4189
03:37:06,379 --> 03:37:07,479
spell lines for the gate.

4190
03:37:08,219 --> 03:37:12,020
There was one other route you could try other than

4191
03:37:12,020 --> 03:37:13,020
finding the nobles.

4192
03:37:13,020 --> 03:37:14,719
You mean a one two.

4193
03:37:16,469 --> 03:37:17,069
I have a two.

4194
03:37:17,069 --> 03:37:17,870
Let's go tutus.

4195
03:37:24,040 --> 03:37:27,309
Not someone exactly but there are other forces

4196
03:37:27,309 --> 03:37:31,280
with knowledge to fours.

4197
03:37:31,379 --> 03:37:34,840
Okay, hold on.

4198
03:37:34,840 --> 03:37:35,540
He has three.

4199
03:37:35,639 --> 03:37:50,260
So he might have a really one of the nobles Lord

4200
03:37:50,459 --> 03:37:53,659
Mulas was a follower of the gods slang.

4201
03:37:54,420 --> 03:37:57,639
If you visit his priest, perhaps the God will know

4202
03:37:57,739 --> 03:37:58,739
is only one problem.

4203
03:38:00,079 --> 03:38:03,139
Where's the priest of slang or fours?

4204
03:38:05,209 --> 03:38:09,209
I could call it but that means but if he has to

4205
03:38:09,209 --> 03:38:15,819
he might have to I could call it.

4206
03:38:20,909 --> 03:38:22,709
This is dangerous though, because if he had I don't

4207
03:38:22,709 --> 03:38:23,209
think so.

4208
03:38:25,659 --> 03:38:26,260
I'll call it.

4209
03:38:26,559 --> 03:38:30,719
That means he has to have to and he didn't good.

4210
03:38:39,260 --> 03:38:39,959
Let me see.

4211
03:38:39,959 --> 03:38:40,459
All right.

4212
03:38:40,559 --> 03:38:41,760
Holy shit.

4213
03:38:43,270 --> 03:38:43,670
Okay.

4214
03:38:43,670 --> 03:38:49,049
Well, um, so I just go right for it and just try

4215
03:38:49,049 --> 03:38:49,750
to get him to call.

4216
03:38:50,639 --> 03:38:52,239
I think there are four twos, right?

4217
03:38:52,540 --> 03:38:53,739
This is stupid, right?

4218
03:38:55,329 --> 03:38:56,329
I could just get him to call.

4219
03:39:07,489 --> 03:39:07,790
No.

4220
03:39:07,790 --> 03:39:08,690
Yeah, no way.

4221
03:39:08,690 --> 03:39:09,690
Oh, yeah, really?

4222
03:39:10,840 --> 03:39:11,540
What do we got?

4223
03:39:11,840 --> 03:39:13,340
I got four twos buddy.

4224
03:39:14,450 --> 03:39:16,450
Both hands just fucking went through the desk.

4225
03:39:24,149 --> 03:39:24,950
Let me see.

4226
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:26,549
I think we got everything we needed out of this guy.

4227
03:39:26,549 --> 03:39:26,750
All right.

4228
03:39:26,750 --> 03:39:28,350
So he has one one die left.

4229
03:39:29,530 --> 03:39:30,129
One one.

4230
03:39:30,129 --> 03:39:30,430
All right.

4231
03:39:30,430 --> 03:39:36,930
I think there are two ones three ones.

4232
03:39:36,930 --> 03:39:37,129
All right.

4233
03:39:37,129 --> 03:39:38,229
Well, it's literally impossible.

4234
03:39:38,229 --> 03:39:38,829
I win.

4235
03:39:39,229 --> 03:39:40,129
I get all your money.

4236
03:39:46,430 --> 03:39:48,629
You flick the monk's final die off the table with a

4237
03:39:48,629 --> 03:39:49,129
grin.

4238
03:39:49,860 --> 03:39:50,360
I win.

4239
03:39:50,659 --> 03:39:54,610
You tell him do you have time to play again?

4240
03:39:55,149 --> 03:39:58,350
The monk asks he glances at the workers in the field

4241
03:39:58,350 --> 03:40:03,110
as he asks and play again.

4242
03:40:05,979 --> 03:40:10,219
Should I play again more?

4243
03:40:11,079 --> 03:40:15,659
Okay, another game.

4244
03:40:15,659 --> 03:40:16,159
You agree.

4245
03:40:16,159 --> 03:40:16,659
All right.

4246
03:40:17,389 --> 03:40:18,290
Do I get more info?

4247
03:40:23,270 --> 03:40:29,399
Let's begin at one two ones.

4248
03:40:29,700 --> 03:40:30,399
Let's start it off.

4249
03:40:33,079 --> 03:40:35,979
Our orders follow the goddess of chance and fortune.

4250
03:40:39,340 --> 03:40:41,139
Bro, you have do you have three of those?

4251
03:40:42,829 --> 03:40:43,329
Who's that?

4252
03:40:43,329 --> 03:40:45,129
The or the goddess of chance and fortune?

4253
03:40:49,219 --> 03:40:50,819
No, that's that's not the only way you have three.

4254
03:40:52,190 --> 03:40:53,389
Oh, you got to be shitting me.

4255
03:40:53,870 --> 03:40:54,069
All right.

4256
03:40:54,069 --> 03:40:54,469
Whatever.

4257
03:40:54,469 --> 03:40:54,870
Fuck you.

4258
03:41:01,969 --> 03:41:03,170
This is the most elegant game.

4259
03:41:03,170 --> 03:41:03,670
Is it not?

4260
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:20,280
One four two ones three ones.

4261
03:41:20,379 --> 03:41:20,780
All right.

4262
03:41:20,879 --> 03:41:21,379
You deaf.

4263
03:41:21,379 --> 03:41:22,780
You don't have three ones.

4264
03:41:25,629 --> 03:41:27,229
You don't have three ones.

4265
03:41:27,229 --> 03:41:28,829
You don't have three ones.

4266
03:41:30,840 --> 03:41:31,340
No way.

4267
03:41:34,500 --> 03:41:34,899
Got it.

4268
03:41:41,739 --> 03:41:42,639
Okay, let's begin.

4269
03:41:45,959 --> 03:41:47,159
I'm gonna be a fucking weirdo.

4270
03:41:47,459 --> 03:41:47,760
Ready?

4271
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:48,159
Watch this.

4272
03:41:49,370 --> 03:41:58,549
Two two twos three twos.

4273
03:42:05,340 --> 03:42:06,940
I'm not reading the text shit.

4274
03:42:07,479 --> 03:42:08,180
I'm not reading the text.

4275
03:42:08,180 --> 03:42:09,479
I'm too busy playing the game.

4276
03:42:11,430 --> 03:42:11,930
What do you say?

4277
03:42:11,930 --> 03:42:13,030
What do you say something important?

4278
03:42:15,069 --> 03:42:16,469
So you are new to our city.

4279
03:42:17,420 --> 03:42:18,420
I arrived yesterday.

4280
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:24,860
Okay to let's be honest two threes.

4281
03:42:28,319 --> 03:42:28,920
Really?

4282
03:42:29,389 --> 03:42:32,190
You're gonna call me on that because I did what I did last game.

4283
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:34,420
Well, that was stupid.

4284
03:42:39,680 --> 03:42:40,180
Scroll up.

4285
03:42:40,180 --> 03:42:40,579
I will.

4286
03:42:48,829 --> 03:42:49,629
He only has one.

4287
03:42:51,670 --> 03:42:52,870
I say let's just start here.

4288
03:42:54,559 --> 03:43:01,500
Like oh yeah, I got this one four two fours.

4289
03:43:01,500 --> 03:43:02,100
Really?

4290
03:43:02,100 --> 03:43:03,500
That would be interesting considering.

4291
03:43:03,500 --> 03:43:12,360
I don't have any fucking dummy one more the monk suggest.

4292
03:43:12,360 --> 03:43:13,860
I'm learning a great deal.

4293
03:43:15,579 --> 03:43:15,979
Really?

4294
03:43:15,979 --> 03:43:17,079
Am I gonna beat you three times?

4295
03:43:17,739 --> 03:43:17,940
All right.

4296
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:18,540
What did he say?

4297
03:43:22,729 --> 03:43:23,129
See?

4298
03:43:23,129 --> 03:43:24,780
Wait, here we go.

4299
03:43:24,780 --> 03:43:25,079
Here we go.

4300
03:43:25,940 --> 03:43:27,639
Where's the priest the priest of slang?

4301
03:43:28,530 --> 03:43:31,629
The shrine is just before the docks down the middle lane from the well,

4302
03:43:32,139 --> 03:43:34,239
but it's not open to strangers all evening.

4303
03:43:34,639 --> 03:43:38,530
You must reach it before nightfall middle.

4304
03:43:38,530 --> 03:43:40,430
Okay down the middle lane from the well.

4305
03:43:44,450 --> 03:43:45,549
Okay, you're new.

4306
03:43:46,250 --> 03:43:47,850
You've learned our little game very quickly.

4307
03:43:48,930 --> 03:43:49,530
Let's begin.

4308
03:43:49,530 --> 03:43:50,129
Here's a bit.

4309
03:43:50,129 --> 03:43:50,629
Okay.

4310
03:43:50,729 --> 03:43:51,129
All right.

4311
03:43:51,739 --> 03:43:53,540
One more one more one more one more.

4312
03:43:53,540 --> 03:43:53,840
Fine.

4313
03:43:56,129 --> 03:43:56,530
Let's do again.

4314
03:44:02,479 --> 03:44:11,879
Okay, to right.

4315
03:44:11,879 --> 03:44:12,680
Should I go for the call?

4316
03:44:16,700 --> 03:44:22,360
Just do it right off the bat three three fours right off the bat.

4317
03:44:25,680 --> 03:44:26,079
Call it.

4318
03:44:30,399 --> 03:44:30,899
Thank you.

4319
03:44:34,520 --> 03:44:35,120
Any more info?

4320
03:44:40,069 --> 03:44:40,870
No, not yet.

4321
03:44:40,870 --> 03:44:46,790
I wonder if I've been in three times what happens to twos.

4322
03:44:46,889 --> 03:44:47,489
Really?

4323
03:44:49,149 --> 03:44:56,379
How about three twos?

4324
03:44:56,479 --> 03:44:57,180
Why would you call that?

4325
03:44:57,180 --> 03:44:57,979
Wait, was he lying to me?

4326
03:44:58,280 --> 03:45:01,200
Yes, I have one too you.

4327
03:45:01,299 --> 03:45:02,469
Why would you do that?

4328
03:45:02,670 --> 03:45:02,969
What?

4329
03:45:03,510 --> 03:45:04,209
I got him again.

4330
03:45:09,899 --> 03:45:10,799
He only has two die.

4331
03:45:11,750 --> 03:45:12,149
All right.

4332
03:45:12,149 --> 03:45:18,719
How about two ones?

4333
03:45:22,290 --> 03:45:23,190
Two.

4334
03:45:23,489 --> 03:45:24,090
Okay.

4335
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:30,620
I got two of those.

4336
03:45:30,920 --> 03:45:32,120
He must have at least one.

4337
03:45:38,229 --> 03:45:38,629
Four.

4338
03:45:38,629 --> 03:45:39,129
All right.

4339
03:45:39,629 --> 03:45:40,229
Dude, come on.

4340
03:45:43,090 --> 03:45:44,389
Does he have a double?

4341
03:45:51,969 --> 03:45:53,569
That means he has to have a double.

4342
03:45:53,969 --> 03:45:54,569
I'm gonna call it.

4343
03:45:56,260 --> 03:45:56,860
What a punk.

4344
03:45:57,159 --> 03:45:58,159
What a punk.

4345
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:06,680
Okay.

4346
03:46:06,979 --> 03:46:07,879
Two.

4347
03:46:08,549 --> 03:46:09,350
You only have one.

4348
03:46:09,350 --> 03:46:10,750
So two fours.

4349
03:46:14,360 --> 03:46:15,159
I have two.

4350
03:46:15,360 --> 03:46:15,860
Okay.

4351
03:46:17,159 --> 03:46:17,860
Unless he wants...

4352
03:46:17,959 --> 03:46:18,559
Should I just call him?

4353
03:46:18,559 --> 03:46:19,059
No.

4354
03:46:20,110 --> 03:46:20,510
All right.

4355
03:46:21,440 --> 03:46:23,139
Dude, I have so many.

4356
03:46:24,379 --> 03:46:24,979
Three.

4357
03:46:27,340 --> 03:46:28,340
Just call him right now.

4358
03:46:28,340 --> 03:46:28,739
No, dude.

4359
03:46:28,739 --> 03:46:29,540
That would be accurate.

4360
03:46:35,649 --> 03:46:36,149
Four.

4361
03:46:41,579 --> 03:46:43,280
But he definitely has that.

4362
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:48,739
I got screwed.

4363
03:46:48,739 --> 03:46:49,639
This hand screwed me here.

4364
03:47:01,340 --> 03:47:01,639
What?

4365
03:47:01,639 --> 03:47:02,239
Okay, I'm gonna call.

4366
03:47:02,239 --> 03:47:03,340
What if he doesn't even have that?

4367
03:47:05,959 --> 03:47:06,159
That's fine.

4368
03:47:06,159 --> 03:47:07,459
The guy won one round.

4369
03:47:07,459 --> 03:47:08,159
He's got one die.

4370
03:47:08,159 --> 03:47:08,659
I'm fine.

4371
03:47:11,850 --> 03:47:15,750
This guy literally has one hand out of like 15 we've played.

4372
03:47:23,389 --> 03:47:27,680
This guy's screwed.

4373
03:47:27,879 --> 03:47:28,379
Two threes.

4374
03:47:32,840 --> 03:47:33,340
Bullshit.

4375
03:47:33,780 --> 03:47:34,879
No, that's not what he has.

4376
03:47:35,250 --> 03:47:35,850
That's bullshit.

4377
03:47:36,649 --> 03:47:37,149
Bullshit.

4378
03:47:37,149 --> 03:47:38,049
You don't have a three.

4379
03:47:41,049 --> 03:47:42,149
What the fuck?

4380
03:47:50,079 --> 03:47:52,340
Maybe one three.

4381
03:47:55,510 --> 03:47:57,309
How about one five?

4382
03:47:58,739 --> 03:47:59,540
Well, one four.

4383
03:48:02,639 --> 03:48:03,040
Two.

4384
03:48:05,700 --> 03:48:06,799
Hey, see ya.

4385
03:48:06,899 --> 03:48:07,399
Sit down.

4386
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,000
I win.

4387
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:12,280
Yes.

4388
03:48:13,649 --> 03:48:15,149
The monk nods sagely.

4389
03:48:16,010 --> 03:48:18,110
The other brothers are returning to the monastery.

4390
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:20,600
I must go in, he says.

4391
03:48:21,069 --> 03:48:23,370
It is time for our midday considerations.

4392
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:26,139
You have been a truly formidable opponent.

4393
03:48:27,059 --> 03:48:30,760
As he stands, he grasps your hands between his and mutters a blessing.

4394
03:48:31,399 --> 03:48:34,700
You feel a tremendous wellness flooding through your body.

4395
03:48:35,430 --> 03:48:38,129
Thanking him, you head back to the main road once more.

4396
03:48:40,590 --> 03:48:40,989
All right.

4397
03:48:41,780 --> 03:48:42,479
Got two clues.

4398
03:48:44,280 --> 03:48:44,879
That works.

4399
03:48:50,520 --> 03:48:52,920
Only one way to go and it's this way.

4400
03:48:55,469 --> 03:48:56,270
18 HP.

4401
03:48:56,270 --> 03:48:56,770
Holy shit.

4402
03:49:00,959 --> 03:49:01,559
That works.

4403
03:49:03,290 --> 03:49:03,989
That's a big deal.

4404
03:49:05,620 --> 03:49:08,620
Road leads directly into one side of a large dome building.

4405
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:11,020
It's some kind of sprawling covered market.

4406
03:49:11,819 --> 03:49:12,819
Looking left and right.

4407
03:49:13,219 --> 03:49:16,319
You see several other roads entering the building through different archways.

4408
03:49:17,239 --> 03:49:19,940
A group of serpent heads are just passing by.

4409
03:49:22,959 --> 03:49:23,860
Okay, talk to them.

4410
03:49:26,069 --> 03:49:26,770
You stop one.

4411
03:49:26,969 --> 03:49:27,670
Greetings.

4412
03:49:27,670 --> 03:49:28,670
What is this place?

4413
03:49:29,440 --> 03:49:31,739
The serpent head looks back at you, unimpressed.

4414
03:49:32,799 --> 03:49:34,200
It's the artist's quarter.

4415
03:49:35,299 --> 03:49:37,100
They have to have a roof over them.

4416
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:40,200
Or their paints run and they complain.

4417
03:49:42,379 --> 03:49:44,979
Nothing worse than a complaining artist.

4418
03:49:45,659 --> 03:49:46,860
Remarks the second creature.

4419
03:49:48,659 --> 03:49:50,760
Sounds worthless.

4420
03:50:00,940 --> 03:50:03,340
Sounds worthless, you reply.

4421
03:50:04,750 --> 03:50:08,149
One of the serpent heads, a female, makes a harrumping noise.

4422
03:50:09,299 --> 03:50:11,399
Make fun of my son's lisp, would you?

4423
03:50:11,940 --> 03:50:12,639
She asks.

4424
03:50:13,040 --> 03:50:15,940
Then with one hooked fin smacks you about the head.

4425
03:50:16,780 --> 03:50:20,479
The rest of the group turn their nostrils and march inside the market.

4426
03:50:20,780 --> 03:50:22,979
Intriguing sounds drift from inside.

4427
03:50:22,979 --> 03:50:24,180
Oh, fuck.

4428
03:50:29,420 --> 03:50:30,319
But that was a...

4429
03:50:31,219 --> 03:50:32,319
I thought they were, but they're...

4430
03:50:33,020 --> 03:50:33,420
Whatever.

4431
03:50:39,239 --> 03:50:39,940
What an asshole.

4432
03:50:39,940 --> 03:50:41,639
I, uh, what, it's like, I don't...

4433
03:50:42,840 --> 03:50:43,639
Shit, dude.

4434
03:50:46,920 --> 03:50:47,319
Sorry.

4435
03:50:49,389 --> 03:50:51,290
The market is a maze of alleys.

4436
03:50:51,590 --> 03:50:53,690
Every inch of space is being used for trade.

4437
03:50:54,090 --> 03:50:57,989
With shops, stalls, and piles of goods set out on crates and barrels.

4438
03:50:58,489 --> 03:51:02,590
Talkers bellow about their wares, each trying to shout down the next.

4439
03:51:03,399 --> 03:51:05,899
People and all manner of strange creatures mill about.

4440
03:51:06,399 --> 03:51:07,799
Most are probably pickpockets.

4441
03:51:08,299 --> 03:51:10,200
Very few seem to be buying anything.

4442
03:51:12,780 --> 03:51:17,340
Into the crowd, you've lost health.

4443
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:22,430
You lose yourself browsing the stands.

4444
03:51:22,729 --> 03:51:23,829
Most sell carpets.

4445
03:51:24,229 --> 03:51:27,129
But some also offer incense burners, lanterns, and pottery.

4446
03:51:27,729 --> 03:51:30,629
You can't see any blacksmiths or food stalls, however.

4447
03:51:30,829 --> 03:51:33,559
Okay.

4448
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:35,440
You go.

4449
03:51:38,930 --> 03:51:42,829
You move on through the market, elbowing your way between shoppers and hawkers.

4450
03:51:43,129 --> 03:51:45,329
To stand below the enormous glass dome.

4451
03:51:46,420 --> 03:51:50,020
Through the hubbub of passersby, you spot the exit across the hall.

4452
03:51:50,950 --> 03:51:53,950
Noise rolls like thunder around the roof of the market.

4453
03:51:55,780 --> 03:51:56,280
Okay.

4454
03:51:57,569 --> 03:51:58,670
Back down the market.

4455
03:51:59,069 --> 03:52:00,760
The far end.

4456
03:52:00,760 --> 03:52:02,959
I could go into the market area, or I could leave.

4457
03:52:03,459 --> 03:52:04,360
I could probably do both.

4458
03:52:04,959 --> 03:52:06,760
So we're gonna go down this way first.

4459
03:52:07,760 --> 03:52:08,059
Alright.

4460
03:52:11,559 --> 03:52:13,159
You walk to the furthest end of the market.

4461
03:52:13,260 --> 03:52:15,159
On your left, a man grabs your sleeve.

4462
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:16,899
You want to buy a carpet?

4463
03:52:17,299 --> 03:52:17,799
He asks.

4464
03:52:18,100 --> 03:52:19,899
Find his carpets this side of the backlands.

4465
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:21,600
Made from real moths.

4466
03:52:25,510 --> 03:52:26,110
Look at the carpets.

4467
03:52:27,360 --> 03:52:28,860
Behind the man is a towering stack.

4468
03:52:28,860 --> 03:52:30,260
30 or 40 carpets high.

4469
03:52:30,659 --> 03:52:31,860
Each one is gray.

4470
03:52:32,360 --> 03:52:34,860
And so dusty that they make you want to sneeze.

4471
03:52:35,559 --> 03:52:38,059
A fight has broken out in one corner of the market.

4472
03:52:38,360 --> 03:52:40,959
It is quickly settled by a score of passersby.

4473
03:52:45,100 --> 03:52:45,899
Moth carpet.

4474
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:46,600
Hog.

4475
03:52:49,649 --> 03:52:51,850
Very good carpet, the man assures you.

4476
03:52:52,250 --> 03:52:52,950
How large you want?

4477
03:52:53,149 --> 03:52:53,750
Size of a bed?

4478
03:52:53,850 --> 03:52:54,450
Size of a room?

4479
03:52:54,549 --> 03:52:55,649
Size of a palace garden?

4480
03:52:56,049 --> 03:52:57,649
I give you same price.

4481
03:52:58,250 --> 03:52:59,850
He drags out a carpet to show you.

4482
03:53:02,010 --> 03:53:02,709
Look at the carpet.

4483
03:53:02,909 --> 03:53:04,110
Show me your very best carpet.

4484
03:53:04,110 --> 03:53:05,010
I don't want a carpet.

4485
03:53:16,059 --> 03:53:17,459
Throw a fucking fireball at him.

4486
03:53:19,100 --> 03:53:20,100
Great wind.

4487
03:53:23,319 --> 03:53:24,420
There's all the sus.

4488
03:53:25,020 --> 03:53:26,319
There is tell.

4489
03:53:27,799 --> 03:53:28,799
I can read his mind.

4490
03:53:30,920 --> 03:53:32,319
There's cause a stench.

4491
03:53:34,639 --> 03:53:35,940
I can summon the giant.

4492
03:53:41,479 --> 03:53:42,780
I feel like that would be such a waste.

4493
03:53:42,780 --> 03:53:45,280
God, I need to use the Resident Evil rocket launcher already.

4494
03:53:48,629 --> 03:53:48,930
Do it.

4495
03:53:48,930 --> 03:53:49,930
Yawb, please.

4496
03:53:50,329 --> 03:53:51,729
Just do yawb and rewind.

4497
03:53:51,930 --> 03:53:53,329
Is that do I get a free rewind here?

4498
03:53:54,590 --> 03:53:55,489
Yawb, I'm doing it.

4499
03:53:55,489 --> 03:53:55,790
Fuck it.

4500
03:54:02,750 --> 03:54:05,649
You toss down one of your giant's teeth and cast your spell.

4501
03:54:06,149 --> 03:54:09,250
It burst into smoke, which makes the carpet seller panic

4502
03:54:09,649 --> 03:54:11,450
and rush for a bucket of sand.

4503
03:54:12,389 --> 03:54:14,790
But instead of a fire, the smoke turns into a giant

4504
03:54:15,190 --> 03:54:18,590
who fills the small shop and then quickly burst through the roof

4505
03:54:18,590 --> 03:54:20,489
as it stretches to its full height.

4506
03:54:23,110 --> 03:54:26,510
The carpet seller yells in terror and rushes out through one of the

4507
03:54:26,510 --> 03:54:31,610
collapsed walls closely followed two gnomes who had been hiding behind

4508
03:54:31,610 --> 03:54:32,809
the stack of carpets.

4509
03:54:35,020 --> 03:54:36,219
Send the giant after them.

4510
03:54:36,319 --> 03:54:37,920
Tell the giant to move the carpet.

4511
03:54:44,420 --> 03:54:45,920
Tell the giant to move the carpets.

4512
03:54:48,079 --> 03:54:50,579
You set the giant to tidying up the piles of carpets

4513
03:54:50,979 --> 03:54:52,979
and discover a pair of nose plugs

4514
03:54:53,479 --> 03:54:56,379
and a small bag containing six gold pieces in the process.

4515
03:54:56,979 --> 03:54:57,579
You pocket them.

4516
03:54:57,979 --> 03:55:01,079
Just as the giant disappears once more and you stride back.

4517
03:55:01,079 --> 03:55:02,979
I can do the stink spell now.

4518
03:55:10,600 --> 03:55:13,500
But our giant friend, all he did was just scare everybody.

4519
03:55:20,719 --> 03:55:21,219
Is it worth?

4520
03:55:21,219 --> 03:55:21,920
It's probably worth.

4521
03:55:21,920 --> 03:55:22,819
I got a new spell.

4522
03:55:23,120 --> 03:55:23,719
We traded.

4523
03:55:26,129 --> 03:55:32,309
Is it worth trading the giant for a smelly smell?

4524
03:55:34,049 --> 03:55:34,549
I don't know.

4525
03:55:38,270 --> 03:55:40,270
You traded a rocket launcher for an air horn.

4526
03:55:47,489 --> 03:55:50,290
You summoned the giant for carpets, but not the manticore.

4527
03:55:51,260 --> 03:55:56,379
I know, but we got a money and

4528
03:55:58,540 --> 03:55:59,639
I'm going to live with it.

4529
03:55:59,739 --> 03:56:00,340
I'm going to keep it.

4530
03:56:01,629 --> 03:56:02,229
I'm going to keep it.

4531
03:56:04,600 --> 03:56:05,200
I'm going to keep it.

4532
03:56:07,319 --> 03:56:08,020
I'm going to keep it.

4533
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:09,319
That's my

4534
03:56:10,420 --> 03:56:11,920
that's what I just that's what I'm deciding.

4535
03:56:14,579 --> 03:56:15,680
The market seems to be endless.

4536
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:18,280
You're quite sure you've seen the same 12 creatures walking

4537
03:56:18,280 --> 03:56:19,180
around in his circles.

4538
03:56:19,180 --> 03:56:29,340
Now, okay below the dome waste of a giant.

4539
03:56:29,340 --> 03:56:33,829
I just destroyed his stall and then stole nose plugs.

4540
03:56:33,829 --> 03:56:34,829
It's all right though.

4541
03:56:38,600 --> 03:56:40,799
You return to the middle of the market below the dome looking

4542
03:56:40,799 --> 03:56:41,200
to one side.

4543
03:56:41,200 --> 03:56:43,600
You spot a small artist studio sign above.

4544
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:46,299
It says find yourself in here.

4545
03:56:47,170 --> 03:56:49,610
The artist sits outside you a feeling.

4546
03:56:49,610 --> 03:56:52,209
There is something strange about him, but you cannot work

4547
03:56:52,209 --> 03:56:53,510
out immediately what it is.

4548
03:56:56,850 --> 03:56:57,850
Please go back.

4549
03:56:58,620 --> 03:57:02,020
Hey, I have to I can't just rewind every thing.

4550
03:57:04,879 --> 03:57:07,680
I have I can't just rewind every single thing, right?

4551
03:57:07,780 --> 03:57:17,510
I have to live with some decision free rewind.

4552
03:57:17,610 --> 03:57:18,909
The fart spell is good.

4553
03:57:19,850 --> 03:57:20,649
I'm begging you.

4554
03:57:20,649 --> 03:57:26,340
No, no, no, I can't I can't I can't.

4555
03:57:28,120 --> 03:57:30,520
You were supposed to rewind that but it was funny and I

4556
03:57:30,520 --> 03:57:32,920
want to keep the spell because I want to keep the stinky spell.

4557
03:57:36,219 --> 03:57:38,420
You rewind 15 times for an orb.

4558
03:57:38,620 --> 03:57:39,719
That's not true.

4559
03:57:40,620 --> 03:57:42,920
I didn't get an orb in my inventory after that.

4560
03:57:42,920 --> 03:57:45,920
I was desperately trying to get the orb in my inventory

4561
03:57:45,920 --> 03:57:46,719
and I didn't get it.

4562
03:57:55,079 --> 03:57:55,479
All right.

4563
03:57:55,479 --> 03:57:56,280
I'm going to run a poll.

4564
03:57:56,479 --> 03:57:57,180
Here's the poll.

4565
03:57:57,680 --> 03:57:59,280
This has to be at least 70%

4566
03:58:05,370 --> 03:58:06,469
re keep giant.

4567
03:58:06,469 --> 03:58:08,170
Yes or no and I go back.

4568
03:58:08,569 --> 03:58:15,860
It's got to be at least 70% keep giant.

4569
03:58:15,860 --> 03:58:16,360
Yes or no.

4570
03:58:17,840 --> 03:58:19,639
This got to be 70% at least.

4571
03:58:35,620 --> 03:58:36,920
I don't think it's going to get there.

4572
03:58:37,319 --> 03:58:39,120
Lot of people don't want to rewind.

4573
03:58:39,120 --> 03:58:40,719
I think you guys understand.

4574
03:58:44,899 --> 03:58:45,500
Oh fuck.

4575
03:58:45,500 --> 03:58:46,899
Wait, keep giant is winning.

4576
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:57,739
Oh God, whatever keep giant is a rewind.

4577
03:58:59,670 --> 03:59:00,670
This is confusing.

4578
03:59:00,969 --> 03:59:01,569
No keep.

4579
03:59:01,569 --> 03:59:01,969
All right.

4580
03:59:02,170 --> 03:59:02,770
Hold on.

4581
03:59:04,590 --> 03:59:05,889
If you misunderstand it.

4582
03:59:05,889 --> 03:59:06,290
Hold on.

4583
03:59:06,290 --> 03:59:07,690
Let me do another one hole.

4584
03:59:11,069 --> 03:59:13,170
It's a misunderstanding.

4585
03:59:13,170 --> 03:59:19,879
It was too complicated raising.

4586
03:59:20,180 --> 03:59:20,579
What do you mean?

4587
03:59:20,579 --> 03:59:21,079
All right.

4588
03:59:21,379 --> 03:59:28,120
Everybody relax rewind to keep giant.

4589
03:59:29,000 --> 03:59:29,799
There you go.

4590
03:59:29,899 --> 03:59:32,200
Yes or no, it's very simple.

4591
03:59:39,440 --> 03:59:40,440
What do you mean phrasing?

4592
03:59:40,540 --> 03:59:42,540
This is exactly what's going on here.

4593
03:59:58,799 --> 04:00:00,799
I don't I don't know how people are confused by this.

4594
04:00:02,989 --> 04:00:06,909
That how this is not confusing this.

4595
04:00:06,909 --> 04:00:08,309
Do you want me to rewind?

4596
04:00:08,510 --> 04:00:09,610
Do you want me to keep like that?

4597
04:00:09,610 --> 04:00:11,709
I have to do you want me to rewind to keep the giant?

4598
04:00:12,309 --> 04:00:14,610
That's there's nothing confusing about this.

4599
04:00:16,409 --> 04:00:18,309
Hey, he's stinkers.

4600
04:00:22,819 --> 04:00:25,620
Oh, it's close.

4601
04:00:25,719 --> 04:00:27,319
Oh, it's close.

4602
04:00:28,930 --> 04:00:31,930
Oh, it's going to come down to the last second.

4603
04:00:32,729 --> 04:00:35,530
Oh, fine.

4604
04:00:49,090 --> 04:00:55,149
Wait, what you said 70 you said?

4605
04:00:55,149 --> 04:00:57,590
Oh, whoops.

4606
04:01:00,799 --> 04:01:01,200
All right.

4607
04:01:01,200 --> 04:01:01,799
You know what?

4608
04:01:01,899 --> 04:01:02,200
Okay.

4609
04:01:02,200 --> 04:01:03,799
I'm burning this this doll down.

4610
04:01:04,700 --> 04:01:05,700
That's what we're doing here.

4611
04:01:06,000 --> 04:01:06,399
Okay.

4612
04:01:07,200 --> 04:01:08,200
That's what I'm doing now.

4613
04:01:08,700 --> 04:01:09,299
Because you know what?

4614
04:01:09,600 --> 04:01:10,399
This is what you get.

4615
04:01:10,799 --> 04:01:11,799
This is what you get now.

4616
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:15,100
I'm throwing a fireball into this guy's stall.

4617
04:01:15,299 --> 04:01:16,200
That's what you get now.

4618
04:01:16,799 --> 04:01:17,500
That's what you get.

4619
04:01:20,040 --> 04:01:22,340
You cast the spell building a fireball in your palm,

4620
04:01:22,340 --> 04:01:24,639
but you don't have time to decide what to do with it.

4621
04:01:25,239 --> 04:01:28,540
As it turns out that moth wings are extremely flammable

4622
04:01:28,540 --> 04:01:31,239
and this is no mere candle flame you are holding.

4623
04:01:31,739 --> 04:01:34,639
Within seconds the stack of carpets is on fire.

4624
04:01:35,139 --> 04:01:38,239
The owner of the shop turns and flees as do two gnomes

4625
04:01:38,540 --> 04:01:40,540
were hiding behind the pile of rugs.

4626
04:01:41,139 --> 04:01:44,040
The shop collapses as the roof catches and there's nothing

4627
04:01:44,040 --> 04:01:45,840
you can do to stop the fire spreading.

4628
04:01:46,780 --> 04:01:50,180
The crowd around is quickly stampeding as the flames take

4629
04:01:50,180 --> 04:01:50,680
hold.

4630
04:01:51,079 --> 04:01:53,079
The covered market begins to fill with smoke.

4631
04:01:53,079 --> 04:01:55,079
Then you see daylight and race for it.

4632
04:01:55,280 --> 04:01:56,180
No, no, no.

4633
04:01:56,180 --> 04:01:57,379
That doesn't that doesn't work.

4634
04:01:57,780 --> 04:01:58,780
That doesn't work for me.

4635
04:01:58,979 --> 04:01:59,879
That doesn't work for me.

4636
04:01:59,979 --> 04:02:00,379
That doesn't work.

4637
04:02:00,379 --> 04:02:01,180
I'm reminding again.

4638
04:02:05,700 --> 04:02:06,399
That doesn't work for me.

4639
04:02:11,049 --> 04:02:11,450
Okay.

4640
04:02:17,819 --> 04:02:18,120
Okay.

4641
04:02:18,120 --> 04:02:19,020
Here's what we're going to do.

4642
04:02:19,790 --> 04:02:20,989
I'm going to do tell.

4643
04:02:21,690 --> 04:02:22,290
Okay.

4644
04:02:22,790 --> 04:02:23,590
Read minds.

4645
04:02:25,739 --> 04:02:27,840
You slip on the cloth skull cap and cast.

4646
04:02:42,209 --> 04:02:42,610
Okay.

4647
04:02:42,610 --> 04:02:45,959
Hold on tuning into the carpet sellers thoughts.

4648
04:02:46,559 --> 04:02:49,360
He's thinking about the pile of carpets building up by the

4649
04:02:49,360 --> 04:02:53,260
door and how if he just shows you a few more you will be

4650
04:02:53,260 --> 04:02:53,860
trapped.

4651
04:02:54,690 --> 04:02:55,590
How about this?

4652
04:02:56,360 --> 04:02:59,559
He hauls the first carpet to the door and heaves out another

4653
04:02:59,959 --> 04:03:02,360
the rugs aren't light and he huffs and puffs as he moves

4654
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:09,440
them around starts to attack this guy.

4655
04:03:10,700 --> 04:03:11,500
What are the spells can I do?

4656
04:03:14,690 --> 04:03:31,790
Hell sauce.

4657
04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:33,760
I don't have a zap.

4658
04:03:35,399 --> 04:03:36,399
I got yob.

4659
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:39,840
Do the giant again.

4660
04:03:41,540 --> 04:03:45,510
I could just attack yop.

4661
04:03:45,510 --> 04:03:46,809
I'm just doing the same thing.

4662
04:03:46,809 --> 04:03:58,020
I just did yob times to nod do the giant and then rewind

4663
04:03:58,020 --> 04:03:58,420
again.

4664
04:03:58,420 --> 04:03:59,219
Why would I do that?

4665
04:03:59,219 --> 04:03:59,819
I'm attacking him.

4666
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:04,280
It only takes a single punch to fell the carpet seller.

4667
04:04:11,860 --> 04:04:13,559
No, I want the item.

4668
04:04:31,360 --> 04:04:32,659
Whatever fuck it.

4669
04:04:32,659 --> 04:04:33,459
I don't care.

4670
04:04:34,260 --> 04:04:35,559
The market seems to be endless.

4671
04:04:35,559 --> 04:04:38,360
I dropped that guy in one hit by the way, you're quite

4672
04:04:38,360 --> 04:04:40,159
sure you've seen the same 12 creatures.

4673
04:04:40,260 --> 04:04:41,260
Oh, whatever.

4674
04:04:43,120 --> 04:04:45,520
I get to keep yob and I punched a guy in the face.

4675
04:04:45,719 --> 04:04:46,219
Fine.

4676
04:04:50,870 --> 04:04:52,770
You return to the middle of the market below the dome

4677
04:04:52,770 --> 04:04:53,469
looking to one side.

4678
04:04:53,469 --> 04:04:54,770
You spot the artist studio.

4679
04:04:54,770 --> 04:04:55,069
All right.

4680
04:04:55,069 --> 04:04:56,569
I was going to go to the artist studio.

4681
04:05:00,389 --> 04:05:02,889
This fucking bugleberry motherfucker laughing at me is

4682
04:05:02,889 --> 04:05:03,590
freaking me out.

4683
04:05:05,489 --> 04:05:08,489
The artist sits cross-legged surrounded by average quality

4684
04:05:08,489 --> 04:05:09,090
artwork.

4685
04:05:09,590 --> 04:05:11,989
Not surprising really since it seems this painter has no

4686
04:05:11,989 --> 04:05:12,590
hands.

4687
04:05:13,739 --> 04:05:14,739
You're a fraud.

4688
04:05:14,739 --> 04:05:15,739
Why would I ever do that?

4689
04:05:15,739 --> 04:05:16,340
Look at the paintings.

4690
04:05:17,540 --> 04:05:18,739
You look over the portraits.

4691
04:05:19,639 --> 04:05:22,239
He has done a series called the nobles of Carré.

4692
04:05:23,020 --> 04:05:25,520
You recognize none of the faces but do your best to

4693
04:05:25,520 --> 04:05:28,360
commit them to memory or future reference.

4694
04:05:29,260 --> 04:05:31,959
Pictures are not bad considering.

4695
04:05:34,399 --> 04:05:34,799
Greeting.

4696
04:05:36,090 --> 04:05:37,190
The artist nods in return.

4697
04:05:38,739 --> 04:05:40,340
Would you like to buy a painting?

4698
04:05:40,940 --> 04:05:42,139
They're all originals.

4699
04:05:42,139 --> 04:05:43,239
I assure you.

4700
04:05:44,870 --> 04:05:45,969
It does not seem possible.

4701
04:05:46,370 --> 04:05:47,469
How does he hold a brush?

4702
04:05:48,469 --> 04:05:51,670
The artist beams at you and adjusts his sitting position.

4703
04:05:52,989 --> 04:05:53,989
What happened to your hands?

4704
04:05:53,989 --> 04:05:54,690
You're a fraud.

4705
04:05:54,690 --> 04:05:56,590
Do you hold the brush in your mouth?

4706
04:05:57,370 --> 04:05:59,969
This is like fucking rude.

4707
04:06:03,319 --> 04:06:04,420
What happened to your hands?

4708
04:06:05,770 --> 04:06:06,770
You ask bluntly.

4709
04:06:07,510 --> 04:06:10,209
You notice the artist smile slip ever so slightly.

4710
04:06:12,379 --> 04:06:15,280
Someone did not like the picture I drew of them.

4711
04:06:16,170 --> 04:06:18,969
I think he saw a little too much truth in the image.

4712
04:06:22,440 --> 04:06:23,440
I don't want to leave.

4713
04:06:23,440 --> 04:06:23,940
I want to...

4714
04:06:24,540 --> 04:06:26,239
But these are rude.

4715
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:28,319
This is this is rude.

4716
04:06:29,020 --> 04:06:30,420
I don't want to say either one of these things, but I don't

4717
04:06:30,420 --> 04:06:30,920
want to leave.

4718
04:06:30,920 --> 04:06:32,719
I want to like unlock more stuff.

4719
04:06:34,360 --> 04:06:35,059
I'm going to say it.

4720
04:06:36,440 --> 04:06:38,040
Do you hold the brush in your mouth?

4721
04:06:41,379 --> 04:06:42,979
No, no, nothing like that.

4722
04:06:43,479 --> 04:06:44,680
The artist shakes his head.

4723
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:49,579
Ah, but to know my secret, you must step inside my hut.

4724
04:06:50,079 --> 04:06:52,680
There is a painting I'm working on even as we speak.

4725
04:06:53,280 --> 04:06:54,479
He points with his chin.

4726
04:06:54,680 --> 04:06:59,120
Please step inside the hut.

4727
04:06:59,920 --> 04:07:03,729
Okay, SpongeBob.

4728
04:07:04,129 --> 04:07:13,760
The walls of the hut are covered in sketches and the floor

4729
04:07:13,760 --> 04:07:15,260
is splattered with paint and ink.

4730
04:07:16,059 --> 04:07:19,059
In the center of the room is an easel and working furiously

4731
04:07:19,059 --> 04:07:23,659
behind it is a floating brush seemingly guided by an invisible

4732
04:07:23,659 --> 04:07:24,260
hand.

4733
04:07:24,659 --> 04:07:30,260
Okay, look at the...

4734
04:07:30,260 --> 04:07:31,159
Watch the brush.

4735
04:07:32,680 --> 04:07:36,479
The brush moves with hypnotic speed darting in and out of

4736
04:07:36,479 --> 04:07:38,780
different paint pots on the floor and then whipping across

4737
04:07:38,780 --> 04:07:39,379
the canvas.

4738
04:07:39,979 --> 04:07:41,979
Whatever is being depicted, it seems the brush would like to

4739
04:07:41,979 --> 04:07:43,680
finish it as quickly as possible.

4740
04:07:47,649 --> 04:07:50,399
Um, this is freaking me out.

4741
04:07:50,399 --> 04:07:51,799
This is actually freaking me out.

4742
04:07:52,639 --> 04:07:53,440
Look at the canvas.

4743
04:07:54,930 --> 04:07:57,930
You cross the room to look at the canvas and your heart sinks.

4744
04:07:58,530 --> 04:08:00,530
The brush is painting an image of you.

4745
04:08:01,520 --> 04:08:04,719
Now that it has had a closer look, the brush begins to edit

4746
04:08:04,719 --> 04:08:07,020
the picture refining its impression of your features.

4747
04:08:10,200 --> 04:08:11,700
Um, should I grab the brush?

4748
04:08:17,819 --> 04:08:19,120
Or what if it's just a cool picture?

4749
04:08:23,549 --> 04:08:28,680
Wait, you wait to see what the finished image will look like.

4750
04:08:29,079 --> 04:08:31,579
The paintbrush works at furious speed until the painting

4751
04:08:31,579 --> 04:08:32,280
is completed.

4752
04:08:32,879 --> 04:08:37,479
It is not a bad likeness, but then the image on the canvas

4753
04:08:37,479 --> 04:08:38,680
begins to move.

4754
04:08:40,790 --> 04:08:41,190
What?

4755
04:08:41,290 --> 04:08:41,989
Should I wait?

4756
04:08:42,930 --> 04:08:43,729
Run for it.

4757
04:08:44,989 --> 04:08:45,290
Wait.

4758
04:08:46,290 --> 04:08:50,590
You watch, transfixed, as the painted duplicate of yourself

4759
04:08:50,590 --> 04:08:53,290
clamors from the frame to stand on the ground.

4760
04:08:54,159 --> 04:08:56,659
From outside you hear the artist commanding the painting

4761
04:08:56,659 --> 04:08:57,959
to grab your money.

4762
04:08:58,700 --> 04:09:01,299
The duplicate lumbers forward, its sword drawn.

4763
04:09:11,120 --> 04:09:11,520
I don't have any...

4764
04:09:11,520 --> 04:09:12,620
I could throw a grenade if I could.

4765
04:09:16,440 --> 04:09:16,940
Zap.

4766
04:09:21,719 --> 04:09:22,319
Dodd.

4767
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:24,120
Illusion of treasure.

4768
04:09:28,299 --> 04:09:29,000
Probably doze.

4769
04:09:29,500 --> 04:09:30,399
Yep, dop.

4770
04:09:30,899 --> 04:09:31,700
Lock doors.

4771
04:09:36,299 --> 04:09:36,799
Wrap.

4772
04:09:36,899 --> 04:09:38,100
Talk all languages.

4773
04:09:38,200 --> 04:09:39,600
Raz, sharpen your blade.

4774
04:09:46,149 --> 04:09:46,750
Sun.

4775
04:09:47,780 --> 04:09:48,579
Wait, I can like...

4776
04:09:55,090 --> 04:09:55,590
Fireball.

4777
04:09:59,059 --> 04:09:59,860
Dodd might work.

4778
04:09:59,860 --> 04:10:00,559
He wants money.

4779
04:10:03,229 --> 04:10:04,729
You gonna do the Gandalf spell?

4780
04:10:11,290 --> 04:10:12,190
This makes sense.

4781
04:10:21,100 --> 04:10:24,100
Cast a spell and create a small pile of illusionary treasure.

4782
04:10:24,600 --> 04:10:26,799
But your opponent is not in the least bit interested.

4783
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:29,299
You lift your sword ready to engage your double.

4784
04:10:29,299 --> 04:10:31,799
He may have your strength and weapon, but will he have your skill?

4785
04:10:43,670 --> 04:10:45,370
I just full blasted like an idiot.

4786
04:10:54,209 --> 04:10:54,809
All right, we're good.

4787
04:10:55,110 --> 04:10:55,409
We're good.

4788
04:10:55,409 --> 04:10:55,809
Okay.

4789
04:10:59,239 --> 04:10:59,540
He did.

4790
04:10:59,540 --> 04:11:00,239
That was a full blast.

4791
04:11:00,239 --> 04:11:00,840
I'm going to go about...

4792
04:11:00,840 --> 04:11:02,139
I'm going to go like four.

4793
04:11:02,139 --> 04:11:02,840
I'm going to go like three.

4794
04:11:02,840 --> 04:11:04,340
I'm going to go 2.4, 2.5.

4795
04:11:05,559 --> 04:11:05,860
Whatever.

4796
04:11:05,860 --> 04:11:06,159
It's okay.

4797
04:11:06,760 --> 04:11:07,159
That was two.

4798
04:11:07,260 --> 04:11:07,559
That was two.

4799
04:11:07,559 --> 04:11:08,559
We're going to go full blast now.

4800
04:11:11,229 --> 04:11:11,530
Got him.

4801
04:11:16,750 --> 04:11:17,049
Okay.

4802
04:11:17,450 --> 04:11:17,850
Defend.

4803
04:11:18,690 --> 04:11:18,989
Good.

4804
04:11:25,389 --> 04:11:26,190
I'm going full blast.

4805
04:11:26,989 --> 04:11:27,489
Good.

4806
04:11:31,500 --> 04:11:32,200
He's going to go hard.

4807
04:11:34,829 --> 04:11:36,030
Ah, I could have beat that.

4808
04:11:36,030 --> 04:11:36,729
I could have beat that.

4809
04:11:36,729 --> 04:11:37,329
I actually could have.

4810
04:11:40,739 --> 04:11:41,239
Got him again.

4811
04:11:44,559 --> 04:11:45,360
Is he going to come in hard?

4812
04:11:45,360 --> 04:11:45,760
You think?

4813
04:11:48,139 --> 04:11:48,440
Yep.

4814
04:11:48,639 --> 04:11:49,239
I couldn't have done it.

4815
04:11:49,840 --> 04:11:50,639
I think the damage is fine.

4816
04:11:52,700 --> 04:11:53,600
One more full blast.

4817
04:11:53,799 --> 04:11:54,100
He's dead.

4818
04:11:58,510 --> 04:11:59,709
You do not make things easy for it.

4819
04:11:59,709 --> 04:12:01,809
You rush at it swinging a masterful slice.

4820
04:12:02,309 --> 04:12:04,809
Your blade cuts through the fabric of the picture and suddenly

4821
04:12:05,010 --> 04:12:06,809
its fibers unravel in part.

4822
04:12:07,479 --> 04:12:09,680
The painting moves forward tearing itself in two.

4823
04:12:10,280 --> 04:12:11,680
The pieces collapse to the floor.

4824
04:12:11,680 --> 04:12:12,780
The magic broken.

4825
04:12:13,920 --> 04:12:15,920
The hut is suddenly very still.

4826
04:12:16,950 --> 04:12:18,049
Where is that motherfucker?

4827
04:12:19,440 --> 04:12:22,840
Time to teach the artist that such behavior will cost him dearly.

4828
04:12:23,639 --> 04:12:27,739
You search his hut thoroughly.

4829
04:12:28,239 --> 04:12:31,139
In one corner is a stack of pencil sketches labeled

4830
04:12:31,639 --> 04:12:33,340
Shinva, fifth noble.

4831
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:35,540
Theta, seventh noble.

4832
04:12:35,940 --> 04:12:37,840
And Sansus, first noble.

4833
04:12:39,190 --> 04:12:41,690
It is a set of likeness of the nobles of Kare.

4834
04:12:42,290 --> 04:12:44,090
You roll them up and put them in your pack.

4835
04:12:45,059 --> 04:12:46,360
You slip out of the hut once more.

4836
04:12:46,360 --> 04:12:48,360
The artist tries to stop you with his foot.

4837
04:12:49,139 --> 04:12:49,739
You buy?

4838
04:12:50,139 --> 04:12:50,739
He asks.

4839
04:12:53,139 --> 04:12:54,940
Give him a gold piece as charity.

4840
04:12:56,030 --> 04:12:57,530
Your painting just tried to kill me.

4841
04:12:59,049 --> 04:13:00,450
Walk away or not today.

4842
04:13:10,409 --> 04:13:11,510
Your painting just tried to kill me.

4843
04:13:14,620 --> 04:13:15,520
The artist shrugs.

4844
04:13:16,549 --> 04:13:18,649
My art is only what it sees.

4845
04:13:19,149 --> 04:13:19,750
He answers.

4846
04:13:20,350 --> 04:13:22,250
I'm not responsible for your heart.

4847
04:13:23,030 --> 04:13:24,229
Now buy or leave.

4848
04:13:24,629 --> 04:13:26,129
And he gestures away with his nose.

4849
04:13:27,770 --> 04:13:29,270
I've taken my reward already.

4850
04:13:31,969 --> 04:13:34,370
You retort indicating the stack of sketches.

4851
04:13:34,770 --> 04:13:37,069
The artist shrugs apparently not too concerned.

4852
04:13:37,770 --> 04:13:39,969
Those nobles won't be worth much soon anyhow.

4853
04:13:39,969 --> 04:13:40,670
He replies.

4854
04:13:40,670 --> 04:13:41,170
Wait a minute.

4855
04:13:41,739 --> 04:13:42,340
Wait a minute.

4856
04:13:43,620 --> 04:13:44,719
What do you know of the nobles?

4857
04:13:47,290 --> 04:13:48,889
Oh, Vic for first noble.

4858
04:13:49,799 --> 04:13:50,700
The artist nods.

4859
04:13:50,799 --> 04:13:52,899
He salutes you by spitting at your feet.

4860
04:13:53,399 --> 04:13:54,399
Mind how you go.

4861
04:14:01,309 --> 04:14:01,809
Here we go.

4862
04:14:03,389 --> 04:14:03,889
Pretty good.

4863
04:14:05,270 --> 04:14:05,770
Pretty good.

4864
04:14:09,170 --> 04:14:11,469
The market stalls smell of soot and spice.

4865
04:14:13,479 --> 04:14:13,780
Back down.

4866
04:14:13,780 --> 04:14:14,280
Should I go?

4867
04:14:15,180 --> 04:14:15,680
I go this way?

4868
04:14:15,979 --> 04:14:16,579
I'm gonna go this way.

4869
04:14:19,120 --> 04:14:20,420
You return to the lower end of the market.

4870
04:14:20,420 --> 04:14:22,319
The air grows thick with the scent of perfumes,

4871
04:14:22,319 --> 04:14:24,920
incense, and flowers and then a darker smell soot.

4872
04:14:26,079 --> 04:14:29,079
Smoke is coming from a fire master's stall outside of which

4873
04:14:29,079 --> 04:14:32,479
several ornate fires of different colors and shapes are burning.

4874
04:14:34,399 --> 04:14:35,299
Definitely going in here.

4875
04:14:38,479 --> 04:14:44,620
The fire master's face is a patchwork of scars and scabs

4876
04:14:44,719 --> 04:14:46,420
and he smiles a ghastly smile.

4877
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:49,260
Hello there.

4878
04:14:49,959 --> 04:14:52,260
I hope you're interested in fire.

4879
04:14:53,680 --> 04:14:57,780
White, green, blue, and black fires burn side by side in a

4880
04:14:57,780 --> 04:15:00,479
row like flowers in a window box.

4881
04:15:01,450 --> 04:15:04,149
They are quite beautiful and almost hypnotic in the way they

4882
04:15:04,149 --> 04:15:04,549
move.

4883
04:15:07,159 --> 04:15:07,959
What are they for?

4884
04:15:09,350 --> 04:15:10,450
Different things.

4885
04:15:10,850 --> 04:15:12,350
Maybe for relaxing.

4886
04:15:12,750 --> 04:15:15,450
Maybe for making the ladies fall in love with you.

4887
04:15:16,149 --> 04:15:17,149
Some is for cooking.

4888
04:15:17,649 --> 04:15:20,950
Others are warm, but I don't sell so many of those.

4889
04:15:22,680 --> 04:15:24,579
My favorite dough is inside.

4890
04:15:25,989 --> 04:15:28,489
He glances meaningfully at the hut door.

4891
04:15:33,299 --> 04:15:34,200
Okay, show me.

4892
04:15:36,290 --> 04:15:37,190
Be my guest.

4893
04:15:42,739 --> 04:15:44,840
In the center of the fire master's hut, a fierce fire is

4894
04:15:44,840 --> 04:15:47,739
blazing away, frightening to engulf the entire room.

4895
04:15:48,479 --> 04:15:50,680
But the flame is giving off remarkably little heat.

4896
04:15:51,280 --> 04:15:53,379
You're not even breaking a sweat standing this close to it.

4897
04:15:55,629 --> 04:15:56,329
I'm going closer.

4898
04:15:57,559 --> 04:15:58,860
Take a few steps closer.

4899
04:15:59,260 --> 04:16:01,459
From here, you notice that in the very heart of the fire,

4900
04:16:01,459 --> 04:16:02,959
there is a wooden chest.

4901
04:16:03,860 --> 04:16:08,360
The fire reminds you of the one in the grate of the large

4902
04:16:08,360 --> 04:16:10,059
abandoned house you explored earlier.

4903
04:16:13,959 --> 04:16:15,059
So I can just go in it.

4904
04:16:18,819 --> 04:16:20,520
Oh wait, we can read minds here.

4905
04:16:22,350 --> 04:16:26,879
We can, we can do sus.

4906
04:16:27,079 --> 04:16:28,079
You can read the minds.

4907
04:16:31,840 --> 04:16:32,840
Cause sleepiness.

4908
04:16:39,120 --> 04:16:40,219
This is magic protection.

4909
04:16:42,760 --> 04:16:46,260
I feel like sus and tell essentially do the same thing here.

4910
04:16:51,840 --> 04:16:52,239
Hmm.

4911
04:16:55,760 --> 04:16:56,559
What does sus do?

4912
04:16:56,860 --> 04:16:58,659
Sus is sensed danger.

4913
04:16:59,600 --> 04:17:02,299
It tells you if a voice goes in your head and goes, I'll

4914
04:17:02,299 --> 04:17:04,000
be careful of this, this and this.

4915
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:07,520
We'll do tell.

4916
04:17:07,520 --> 04:17:08,719
Tell is sometimes more fun.

4917
04:17:12,639 --> 04:17:15,239
You place the skull cap on your head and cast a spell.

4918
04:17:15,340 --> 04:17:17,739
There are no minds inside the hut to probe.

4919
04:17:18,139 --> 04:17:21,139
But you find the fire master's thoughts easily enough.

4920
04:17:24,190 --> 04:17:26,690
Will this traveler fall into my trial?

4921
04:17:27,559 --> 04:17:28,159
He is thinking.

4922
04:17:28,459 --> 04:17:30,360
Seems he's hoping you will try to enter the flames.

4923
04:17:33,440 --> 04:17:34,540
The chest is closed.

4924
04:17:35,639 --> 04:17:38,739
So you cannot see what is inside, but it's clearly not

4925
04:17:38,739 --> 04:17:40,340
burning despite being made of wood.

4926
04:17:44,479 --> 04:17:45,079
I just leave.

4927
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:50,139
Don't fall for it.

4928
04:17:50,540 --> 04:17:52,139
Well, maybe I can do it.

4929
04:17:52,920 --> 04:17:53,420
I'm going for it.

4930
04:17:55,770 --> 04:17:57,969
You reach out for the chest testing the flames of your finger.

4931
04:17:58,270 --> 04:17:58,969
They're really cool.

4932
04:17:58,969 --> 04:18:01,270
But still to reach the chest, you will need to step inside

4933
04:18:01,270 --> 04:18:01,969
the flame itself.

4934
04:18:05,690 --> 04:18:06,489
But I want it.

4935
04:18:07,190 --> 04:18:08,290
I want, I want it.

4936
04:18:08,290 --> 04:18:08,690
I want it.

4937
04:18:08,690 --> 04:18:09,090
I want it.

4938
04:18:09,090 --> 04:18:09,489
I want it.

4939
04:18:09,489 --> 04:18:10,190
I'm leaving fine.

4940
04:18:11,319 --> 04:18:13,520
You step outside and nod to the fire master.

4941
04:18:14,290 --> 04:18:18,520
Very impressive fire master nods and smiles clearly hoping

4942
04:18:18,520 --> 04:18:23,379
you will buy one of his lesser wares by a small flame.

4943
04:18:24,729 --> 04:18:26,729
Ask him about the fire in the abandoned house.

4944
04:18:26,729 --> 04:18:32,479
Oh, that's interesting.

4945
04:18:34,250 --> 04:18:35,049
How much is okay.

4946
04:18:35,649 --> 04:18:39,579
How much for a small flame is eight gold pieces.

4947
04:18:40,360 --> 04:18:41,159
From the look of you.

4948
04:18:41,659 --> 04:18:45,260
I'd say you want a flame that burns on pure danger.

4949
04:18:46,260 --> 04:18:50,159
Pulls a little box from a bag by his feet in a light when

4950
04:18:50,159 --> 04:18:54,459
you open it and catch on anything dangerous nearby.

4951
04:18:55,059 --> 04:18:59,469
If danger there be if it can it will burn whatever is

4952
04:18:59,469 --> 04:19:01,170
threatening you clean away.

4953
04:19:03,670 --> 04:19:06,170
What is it eight gold?

4954
04:19:10,079 --> 04:19:10,879
I have a lot of money.

4955
04:19:12,739 --> 04:19:13,440
Is it worth buying?

4956
04:19:14,139 --> 04:19:15,440
Yeah, I can't trust this guy at all.

4957
04:19:19,190 --> 04:19:20,389
Use it on this guy.

4958
04:19:23,120 --> 04:19:23,920
That's too expensive.

4959
04:19:27,260 --> 04:19:29,860
Yeah, a nice toy, but I'll save my goal for something more

4960
04:19:29,860 --> 04:19:30,459
impressive.

4961
04:19:31,260 --> 04:19:32,059
Okay, as you will.

4962
04:19:35,879 --> 04:19:36,780
I don't know about this.

4963
04:19:37,579 --> 04:19:40,479
I visited a house here in Kare where fire burned in a hearth

4964
04:19:40,479 --> 04:19:45,110
without heat one of yours the man shrugs perhaps.

4965
04:19:45,790 --> 04:19:49,190
I'm not the only fire master in Kare, but I am the best

4966
04:19:49,690 --> 04:19:50,989
grand house was it?

4967
04:19:53,420 --> 04:19:56,459
Yeah, it was a grand house if abandoned now.

4968
04:19:57,299 --> 04:20:00,530
Ah, the house of Lord Theta.

4969
04:20:00,530 --> 04:20:04,139
I would imagine you trespassed if you went in there.

4970
04:20:04,840 --> 04:20:08,180
You went blind, you know so much for the seventh noble of

4971
04:20:08,180 --> 04:20:08,780
Kare.

4972
04:20:09,579 --> 04:20:10,979
He lives as a beggar now.

4973
04:20:13,000 --> 04:20:13,600
Interesting.

4974
04:20:14,100 --> 04:20:15,000
What about the North Gate?

4975
04:20:17,760 --> 04:20:18,459
Tell me something.

4976
04:20:19,319 --> 04:20:21,719
I need to pass through the North Gate of the city.

4977
04:20:21,719 --> 04:20:24,940
Can you help the fire master shrugs?

4978
04:20:25,540 --> 04:20:26,239
Not me.

4979
04:20:27,819 --> 04:20:28,319
That's me.

4980
04:20:28,620 --> 04:20:29,219
Not bad.

4981
04:20:30,940 --> 04:20:33,979
Not many who do none as I haven't heard of.

4982
04:20:37,219 --> 04:20:37,520
Sorry.

4983
04:20:37,520 --> 04:20:38,620
I was I was no mute.

4984
04:20:38,620 --> 04:20:39,719
I had to fucking do that.

4985
04:20:42,280 --> 04:20:43,879
I know about the spell lines.

4986
04:20:44,479 --> 04:20:45,879
Fuck I can say I'm the mute for a minute.

4987
04:20:57,920 --> 04:20:58,319
Okay.

4988
04:21:01,780 --> 04:21:02,879
I know about the spell lines.

4989
04:21:02,979 --> 04:21:04,280
I was told by an innkeeper.

4990
04:21:05,920 --> 04:21:06,420
Good.

4991
04:21:06,420 --> 04:21:09,020
Well, you'll need no help from the likes of me.

4992
04:21:09,889 --> 04:21:13,290
Unless you'll be wanting to know what the spell lines are.

4993
04:21:14,090 --> 04:21:15,090
That might be harder.

4994
04:21:15,590 --> 04:21:17,690
Nobles are all but disbanded.

4995
04:21:18,190 --> 04:21:19,489
There's no council anymore.

4996
04:21:19,590 --> 04:21:21,489
It's an empty building with some guards.

4997
04:21:23,799 --> 04:21:24,700
Are they all dead?

4998
04:21:28,389 --> 04:21:29,989
No, not all of them.

4999
04:21:30,959 --> 04:21:33,860
I've heard tell but now they've all gone to

5000
04:21:33,860 --> 04:21:35,159
the ground hidden.

5001
04:21:35,760 --> 04:21:38,260
I told you of blind theta already for instance.

5002
04:21:41,520 --> 04:21:43,420
Is there no other way to find the spell lines?

5003
04:21:46,540 --> 04:21:47,139
Probably.

5004
04:21:47,540 --> 04:21:49,040
Kare is full of gods.

5005
04:21:49,739 --> 04:21:50,940
Ask the god of malice.

5006
04:21:51,440 --> 04:21:52,739
He has a priest near here.

5007
04:21:53,409 --> 04:21:56,409
Ask the other one the fat one the god of whatever he's

5008
04:21:56,409 --> 04:21:56,909
a god of.

5009
04:21:57,649 --> 04:22:00,149
He was much chancer getting something from them powers

5010
04:22:00,149 --> 04:22:04,209
that be as he would get a noble to talk seeing as most

5011
04:22:04,209 --> 04:22:08,110
nobles have had their tongues cut out already and at least

5012
04:22:08,110 --> 04:22:09,809
God stay in one place.

5013
04:22:10,909 --> 04:22:11,809
Now get on with you.

5014
04:22:12,110 --> 04:22:13,209
There's real customers.

5015
04:22:13,209 --> 04:22:15,110
I've got to talk to Goku.

5016
04:22:17,780 --> 04:22:19,979
You nod and stride back into the crowds of the market.

5017
04:22:31,670 --> 04:22:33,270
One voice Andy one voice Andy.

5018
04:22:33,270 --> 04:22:36,340
I've got one and it's a good one passing creatures

5019
04:22:36,340 --> 04:22:37,639
jostle and elbow you.

5020
04:22:38,729 --> 04:22:40,229
All right, it's time to leave the market.

5021
04:22:45,680 --> 04:22:46,879
You move back to the center of the market.

5022
04:22:46,879 --> 04:22:49,780
You've been waiting and walking in circles for some time.

5023
04:22:49,780 --> 04:22:52,760
Now you smell of blood and straw.

5024
04:22:56,510 --> 04:22:57,610
I think that's all I can do here.

5025
04:22:59,510 --> 04:23:00,110
Leave the market.

5026
04:23:02,479 --> 04:23:04,979
You turn around intending to leave the market when you

5027
04:23:04,979 --> 04:23:07,479
realize that you have lost sight of the entrance in the

5028
04:23:07,479 --> 04:23:09,379
crush of people and creatures.

5029
04:23:10,059 --> 04:23:12,959
You wander for a few minutes from one carpet seller to

5030
04:23:12,959 --> 04:23:28,649
the next but you quickly utterly lost because like a

5031
04:23:28,649 --> 04:23:34,940
stink cloud fog someone darkness.

5032
04:23:40,649 --> 04:23:46,329
How I'm going to do how you cast the spell in a voice

5033
04:23:46,329 --> 04:23:49,329
enters your mind with clear instructions how to leave

5034
04:23:49,329 --> 04:23:52,229
the market over there complicated and you won't be

5035
04:23:52,229 --> 04:24:02,360
able to remember them unless you go now mad mad do

5036
04:24:02,360 --> 04:24:03,059
something funny.

5037
04:24:04,000 --> 04:24:09,469
I have 10 health riding quickly.

5038
04:24:09,469 --> 04:24:11,569
You follow the twists and turns as guided by the voice

5039
04:24:11,569 --> 04:24:20,680
in your mind until you see daylight emerging blinking

5040
04:24:20,680 --> 04:24:21,379
into the sunshine.

5041
04:24:21,379 --> 04:24:23,879
You find yourself near a tall statue beyond which is a

5042
04:24:23,879 --> 04:24:26,680
wider Plaza at the foot of the statue is a drinking

5043
04:24:26,680 --> 04:24:27,879
fountain drink.

5044
04:24:28,850 --> 04:24:31,850
You drink a deep draught of cool crisp water and feel

5045
04:24:31,850 --> 04:24:32,850
quite refreshed.

5046
04:24:39,549 --> 04:24:42,389
This is a paved clearing perhaps intended for visitors

5047
04:24:42,389 --> 04:24:45,489
to the market to tie up their horses, but if any have

5048
04:24:45,889 --> 04:24:47,690
and it would seem their horses have been stolen.

5049
04:24:48,680 --> 04:24:52,370
We know all about that all around the slum houses rise

5050
04:24:52,370 --> 04:24:55,670
tall squats piled on squats emanating a thick and

5051
04:24:55,670 --> 04:24:56,569
terrible smell.

5052
04:24:57,139 --> 04:25:00,299
There are not many creatures about the main road continues

5053
04:25:00,299 --> 04:25:03,700
between the slums heading up a low rise and a side alley

5054
04:25:03,700 --> 04:25:04,500
leads left.

5055
04:25:09,450 --> 04:25:10,149
Sorry, I didn't mute.

5056
04:25:11,709 --> 04:25:11,909
Okay.

5057
04:25:11,909 --> 04:25:15,780
Look left to the left a narrow road leads deep into a

5058
04:25:15,780 --> 04:25:19,329
slum district, but it's lanes are slung with decoration

5059
04:25:19,329 --> 04:25:23,899
and ragged bunting the main road turns to the right here

5060
04:25:24,299 --> 04:25:27,600
and continues up the rise towards a run of slightly

5061
04:25:27,600 --> 04:25:31,639
grander buildings Ivy and gripweed hang from the bent

5062
04:25:31,840 --> 04:25:34,840
metal railings the whole place seems empty deserted and

5063
04:25:34,840 --> 04:25:38,569
dark suddenly out of an almost invisible narrow alleyway

5064
04:25:38,569 --> 04:25:42,370
a figure no higher than your knee dashes out and collides

5065
04:25:42,370 --> 04:25:46,569
with you sending you sprawling they cry about an apology

5066
04:25:46,569 --> 04:25:52,260
as they hair away down the street run after it check

5067
04:25:52,260 --> 04:25:53,159
myself over.

5068
04:25:55,500 --> 04:25:55,899
Yep.

5069
04:25:56,100 --> 04:25:56,299
Yeah.

5070
04:25:56,299 --> 04:25:56,600
Yeah.

5071
04:25:56,600 --> 04:25:56,899
Yeah.

5072
04:25:56,899 --> 04:25:57,600
Excuse me.

5073
04:25:58,620 --> 04:25:59,420
Excuse me.

5074
04:26:01,819 --> 04:26:04,020
You charge off quickly down the road, you know, a

5075
04:26:04,020 --> 04:26:06,420
pickpocket when you feel one slip their hand into your

5076
04:26:06,420 --> 04:26:09,319
purse you catch sight of them just slipping into a

5077
04:26:09,319 --> 04:26:10,920
narrow alley further up the road.

5078
04:26:11,479 --> 04:26:13,879
It will take you off the main track and into the maze

5079
04:26:13,879 --> 04:26:16,889
like backstreets of Carrie if you follow the slum

5080
04:26:16,889 --> 04:26:19,489
districts of lower Carrie are unlikely to house the

5081
04:26:19,489 --> 04:26:21,760
secret of the North Gate, but you might be able to

5082
04:26:21,760 --> 04:26:23,360
learn where to find out more.

5083
04:26:26,909 --> 04:26:27,309
All right.

5084
04:26:27,309 --> 04:26:32,969
I'm we're about to run into the fall of a thief

5085
04:26:33,370 --> 04:26:34,969
that's going to get us kind of lost here.

5086
04:26:35,959 --> 04:26:37,659
Oh, we do we go down Mansion Row here.

5087
04:26:38,159 --> 04:26:44,600
Do we go up go get the thief into the slums run

5088
04:26:44,600 --> 04:26:47,459
after the thief or take the main road down here.

5089
04:26:49,030 --> 04:26:56,469
This is one, two, three, all will be up shortly one

5090
04:26:56,469 --> 04:27:01,559
two or three main road going up on a main road down

5091
04:27:02,620 --> 04:27:08,120
all the thief or up into the slums to give you a

5092
04:27:08,120 --> 04:27:10,020
better indicator of where we could end up.

5093
04:27:15,979 --> 04:27:20,360
Thief is to one, two, three, one, two, three.

5094
04:27:23,569 --> 04:27:24,870
Oh my God.

5095
04:27:25,600 --> 04:27:27,500
You guys really want that gold.

5096
04:27:28,180 --> 04:27:29,780
Holy wow.

5097
04:27:37,809 --> 04:27:38,309
Damn.

5098
04:27:38,309 --> 04:27:38,709
All right.

5099
04:27:38,709 --> 04:27:39,809
You guys are off of blood.

5100
04:27:40,209 --> 04:27:41,110
Go follow the thief.

5101
04:27:44,100 --> 04:27:47,000
You race into a side alley after the figure twisting

5102
04:27:47,000 --> 04:27:48,399
and turning between tall buildings.

5103
04:27:48,700 --> 04:27:52,590
The thief is a small child who freezes for a moment

5104
04:27:52,690 --> 04:27:55,489
and begins to run twice as fast straight towards a

5105
04:27:55,489 --> 04:27:59,530
high boarded fence kill kill this person right guys.

5106
04:28:00,329 --> 04:28:04,129
Kill this person go get him right really.

5107
04:28:05,030 --> 04:28:06,030
Oh interesting.

5108
04:28:06,329 --> 04:28:07,629
Your choice is very interesting.

5109
04:28:07,930 --> 04:28:10,629
The child looks spry and sprightfully and terrified.

5110
04:28:10,930 --> 04:28:12,829
You wouldn't put it past them to try and climb their

5111
04:28:12,829 --> 04:28:13,430
way out.

5112
04:28:26,379 --> 04:28:31,909
Gack is fear gum is glue.

5113
04:28:31,909 --> 04:28:38,180
I don't have glue August darkness.

5114
04:28:41,209 --> 04:28:42,309
That's all we can do with that.

5115
04:28:44,110 --> 04:28:47,209
We can do dumb which is clumsiness which will make

5116
04:28:47,209 --> 04:28:52,540
them drop something probably slowness does.

5117
04:28:54,700 --> 04:29:02,350
There's also wall which is making invisible wall walk

5118
04:29:02,350 --> 04:29:11,260
is create a shield slowness.

5119
04:29:12,139 --> 04:29:13,239
Just boom.

5120
04:29:14,590 --> 04:29:15,190
Castle.

5121
04:29:18,940 --> 04:29:19,940
That seems like a good idea.

5122
04:29:26,120 --> 04:29:28,719
You cast the spell in the child's movement slow to a

5123
04:29:28,719 --> 04:29:31,920
crawl one foot is placed on the fence.

5124
04:29:32,420 --> 04:29:35,520
They try to leap higher, but they misjudge and fall

5125
04:29:35,520 --> 04:29:37,120
slowly to the floor.

5126
04:29:37,790 --> 04:29:39,690
You grab the child by the scruff of the neck.

5127
04:29:40,090 --> 04:29:40,989
It's a young girl.

5128
04:29:41,489 --> 04:29:43,590
She squirms and wriggles clumsily as she tries to

5129
04:29:43,590 --> 04:29:44,090
escape.

5130
04:29:44,690 --> 04:29:48,079
I think you robbed me.

5131
04:29:48,479 --> 04:29:49,379
What are you running from?

5132
04:29:55,079 --> 04:29:56,180
I think you robbed me.

5133
04:29:58,370 --> 04:30:00,770
I think you robbed me declare me.

5134
04:30:01,069 --> 04:30:02,069
No, I wouldn't.

5135
04:30:02,370 --> 04:30:03,170
I never would.

5136
04:30:03,469 --> 04:30:04,969
I'm being chased by the guard.

5137
04:30:05,569 --> 04:30:06,469
Are you a guard?

5138
04:30:08,260 --> 04:30:08,760
Yes.

5139
04:30:13,850 --> 04:30:15,549
Yes, I am and you're in big trouble.

5140
04:30:17,440 --> 04:30:20,139
Yes, you lie and you're in big trouble, right?

5141
04:30:20,540 --> 04:30:21,940
The girl begins to panic.

5142
04:30:22,969 --> 04:30:25,069
Suddenly you hear footsteps behind you and before you

5143
04:30:25,069 --> 04:30:27,770
can react a figure has grabbed you by the scruff of

5144
04:30:27,770 --> 04:30:30,870
your neck and hauled you backwards into a building.

5145
04:30:32,920 --> 04:30:35,920
Scram this new figure growls to the child who needs

5146
04:30:35,920 --> 04:30:37,819
no further warning and is quickly out of sight.

5147
04:30:37,920 --> 04:30:42,420
What what the fuck?

5148
04:30:48,409 --> 04:30:50,840
Don't be afraid murmurs of voice.

5149
04:30:54,360 --> 04:30:57,159
You turn to see who it is a dark-skinned man with a

5150
04:30:57,159 --> 04:30:59,459
beard of short stubble as you look at him.

5151
04:30:59,459 --> 04:31:01,959
He releases you holding up his hand to show he means

5152
04:31:01,959 --> 04:31:04,950
you no harm apologies to give you a fight.

5153
04:31:05,350 --> 04:31:07,950
He says I thought you were attacking that child.

5154
04:31:08,450 --> 04:31:12,879
Please sit with me and talk for a while that

5155
04:31:12,879 --> 04:31:14,280
child stole from me.

5156
04:31:21,809 --> 04:31:22,409
He nods.

5157
04:31:23,340 --> 04:31:24,440
I'm sure she did.

5158
04:31:25,149 --> 04:31:28,600
That's how they eat around here, but you can take it.

5159
04:31:28,600 --> 04:31:31,799
I'm sure you don't need to take revenge on children.

5160
04:31:31,799 --> 04:31:35,120
Surely you look around the building and realize you're

5161
04:31:35,120 --> 04:31:35,819
in his house.

5162
04:31:35,819 --> 04:31:39,020
You're in his home is well furnished with rich woven

5163
04:31:39,020 --> 04:31:40,219
tapestries on the walls.

5164
04:31:43,840 --> 04:31:44,440
Look him over.

5165
04:31:45,309 --> 04:31:46,209
You look the man over.

5166
04:31:46,809 --> 04:31:50,110
He's a noble looking sort wears fine fur is in a cloak.

5167
04:31:50,690 --> 04:31:53,360
He seems friendly enough, but he can't be a noble.

5168
04:31:53,360 --> 04:31:55,360
You do not recognize him from any of your pictures

5169
04:31:55,360 --> 04:31:57,260
or of the nobles of Kare.

5170
04:32:01,950 --> 04:32:02,549
You take a seat.

5171
04:32:03,549 --> 04:32:04,850
Tell me about Kare you begin.

5172
04:32:04,850 --> 04:32:05,549
I'm new here.

5173
04:32:08,239 --> 04:32:09,639
This is a treacherous place.

5174
04:32:10,569 --> 04:32:12,670
You can't trust anyone or anything in this town.

5175
04:32:13,700 --> 04:32:14,399
He winks at you.

5176
04:32:15,209 --> 04:32:18,409
But before I go into all that, would you like some ale?

5177
04:32:20,479 --> 04:32:20,979
I'll drink with you.

5178
04:32:20,979 --> 04:32:21,579
I must be leaving.

5179
04:32:21,579 --> 04:32:22,280
I don't drink.

5180
04:32:27,729 --> 04:32:29,430
How many times do people have to tell you this place

5181
04:32:29,430 --> 04:32:30,030
sucks?

5182
04:32:34,479 --> 04:32:35,079
Oh, yes.

5183
04:32:35,280 --> 04:32:36,280
Oh, tell me about Kare.

5184
04:32:36,280 --> 04:32:36,979
Yeah, sit down.

5185
04:32:36,979 --> 04:32:38,680
Well, first of all, this place sucks.

5186
04:32:40,239 --> 04:32:40,840
Oh, yes.

5187
04:32:40,840 --> 04:32:41,940
Welcome to Kare.

5188
04:32:41,940 --> 04:32:42,540
Yeah, please.

5189
04:32:42,540 --> 04:32:43,940
Oh, take a look at my wares.

5190
04:32:44,139 --> 04:32:45,440
This place sucks.

5191
04:32:48,700 --> 04:32:54,040
Kare, of course, one of the most dastardly cities, full

5192
04:32:54,040 --> 04:32:56,440
of traps, full of horrible things.

5193
04:32:57,280 --> 04:32:58,579
This place sucks.

5194
04:33:00,020 --> 04:33:01,020
This place sucks.

5195
04:33:02,370 --> 04:33:03,569
They really do all do that.

5196
04:33:03,569 --> 04:33:04,270
They always do that.

5197
04:33:04,270 --> 04:33:04,770
That's true.

5198
04:33:06,380 --> 04:33:07,880
Uh, no, I'm going to drink with them.

5199
04:33:09,740 --> 04:33:12,439
The man returns with two mugs of ale and he places one

5200
04:33:12,439 --> 04:33:13,439
deliberately in front of you.

5201
04:33:14,569 --> 04:33:16,069
So let me tell you about my city.

5202
04:33:16,470 --> 04:33:18,169
It begins conversationally.

5203
04:33:19,040 --> 04:33:22,840
The center of Kare is built around the port and it can

5204
04:33:22,840 --> 04:33:24,340
be a dangerous place at night.

5205
04:33:26,459 --> 04:33:28,659
Hey, do you know the spell lines?

5206
04:33:32,959 --> 04:33:34,860
Like I've already drank five of these apparently.

5207
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:38,939
Why is that?

5208
04:33:40,259 --> 04:33:42,360
Well, they say that those wandering the streets get

5209
04:33:42,659 --> 04:33:45,259
waylaid and captured onto slaving shifts.

5210
04:33:45,959 --> 04:33:49,159
So be sure to be sure to be settled down in an inn

5211
04:33:49,159 --> 04:33:49,959
before sundown.

5212
04:33:51,279 --> 04:33:51,779
To your health.

5213
04:33:57,880 --> 04:34:02,840
Uh, oh shit.

5214
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:13,740
You waste no time summoning the force of zap in your

5215
04:34:13,740 --> 04:34:16,639
hands and then casually flinging into the chest of

5216
04:34:16,639 --> 04:34:17,439
the man opposite.

5217
04:34:17,840 --> 04:34:21,639
He gasps in surprise, but he is not killed only wounded.

5218
04:34:22,040 --> 04:34:24,540
Unsurprisingly, he reaches for his sword and you draw

5219
04:34:24,540 --> 04:34:24,939
your own.

5220
04:34:25,639 --> 04:34:26,340
Kill him in one hit.

5221
04:34:27,139 --> 04:34:38,040
Van Gorn raises his sword and stares at you along

5222
04:34:38,040 --> 04:34:39,040
the length of the blade.

5223
04:34:39,439 --> 04:34:43,060
You grip your sword firmly, then bring it up fast to

5224
04:34:43,060 --> 04:34:44,259
deliver a heavy blow.

5225
04:34:45,060 --> 04:34:47,759
He is off balance and moving slowly and the blade goes

5226
04:34:47,759 --> 04:34:48,060
deep.

5227
04:34:48,700 --> 04:34:51,900
He stumbles forward eyes opening wide with surprise.

5228
04:34:53,529 --> 04:35:00,549
You have finished me after so long undefeated with

5229
04:35:00,549 --> 04:35:01,349
Van Gorn dead.

5230
04:35:01,349 --> 04:35:03,150
You were free to search his small house.

5231
04:35:12,860 --> 04:35:13,560
Open the cover.

5232
04:35:13,560 --> 04:35:14,459
It's open the hangings.

5233
04:35:14,459 --> 04:35:16,259
Look behind the hangings searches by get through

5234
04:35:16,259 --> 04:35:16,759
everything.

5235
04:35:18,709 --> 04:35:21,409
I'm just like opening each curtain.

5236
04:35:24,630 --> 04:35:25,529
What the fuck are you doing?

5237
04:35:25,630 --> 04:35:26,330
I don't know.

5238
04:35:27,229 --> 04:35:28,029
Hey, you know what?

5239
04:35:28,229 --> 04:35:28,729
You know what?

5240
04:35:28,729 --> 04:35:29,830
You know what the fuck I'm doing?

5241
04:35:30,229 --> 04:35:32,330
People just gave me so much shit over the last like

5242
04:35:32,330 --> 04:35:33,330
30 or 40 minutes.

5243
04:35:33,830 --> 04:35:36,830
Oh, he's going to do how he's going to do sus.

5244
04:35:36,830 --> 04:35:38,229
He's going to be so safe.

5245
04:35:38,529 --> 04:35:39,029
Oh, yes.

5246
04:35:39,130 --> 04:35:39,930
Greetings.

5247
04:35:40,029 --> 04:35:41,430
Oh, greetings creature.

5248
04:35:41,529 --> 04:35:42,130
How are you?

5249
04:35:42,130 --> 04:35:43,229
I come in peace.

5250
04:35:43,229 --> 04:35:44,729
I've been getting shit for that for the last hour.

5251
04:35:44,830 --> 04:35:45,229
Okay.

5252
04:35:45,959 --> 04:35:46,759
Oh, greetings.

5253
04:35:46,959 --> 04:35:47,860
I come in peace.

5254
04:35:47,959 --> 04:35:49,159
Oh, can I see your wares?

5255
04:35:49,159 --> 04:35:50,860
No, I will not touch that fire.

5256
04:35:52,040 --> 04:35:55,650
Look, I went full on fucking chaos mode right there

5257
04:35:55,849 --> 04:35:57,750
and we get to loot this guy's whole house.

5258
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:02,970
I don't even remember this guy from the last game.

5259
04:36:03,270 --> 04:36:05,369
This guy could be a really good guy.

5260
04:36:05,669 --> 04:36:06,369
I don't know.

5261
04:36:07,389 --> 04:36:07,889
I don't know.

5262
04:36:07,889 --> 04:36:08,889
I don't know what this could be.

5263
04:36:10,849 --> 04:36:12,250
Dude, you almost killed that kid.

5264
04:36:12,250 --> 04:36:13,250
Excuse me.

5265
04:36:13,250 --> 04:36:14,250
I want to back up here.

5266
04:36:15,139 --> 04:36:20,009
I left that up to you and everyone said thief thief

5267
04:36:20,009 --> 04:36:21,610
go kill the thief kill the thief.

5268
04:36:22,090 --> 04:36:24,590
And when everybody saw oh it was like the you know,

5269
04:36:24,590 --> 04:36:26,590
they turn around and it's a it's a little kid.

5270
04:36:26,889 --> 04:36:27,389
Oh, no.

5271
04:36:27,490 --> 04:36:28,590
Oh, no, I was just kidding.

5272
04:36:28,590 --> 04:36:29,189
I was kidding.

5273
04:36:29,189 --> 04:36:30,389
I'm not no, no, no, no.

5274
04:36:30,389 --> 04:36:31,490
I didn't mean that actually.

5275
04:36:31,889 --> 04:36:32,889
No, I was kidding.

5276
04:36:33,189 --> 04:36:33,990
It was a joke.

5277
04:36:35,740 --> 04:36:39,020
I would like you to go back and and watch the chat.

5278
04:36:39,689 --> 04:36:41,990
I want you to see how many times if you go no go do it

5279
04:36:41,990 --> 04:36:42,689
when the vaude is there.

5280
04:36:42,689 --> 04:36:43,990
It's not there right now, but I want you to go back.

5281
04:36:44,290 --> 04:36:47,090
I want to see how many times the word kill in all capitals

5282
04:36:47,090 --> 04:36:49,299
was put in the chat room, right?

5283
04:36:49,299 --> 04:36:49,700
Okay.

5284
04:36:49,799 --> 04:36:50,400
I want you to see.

5285
04:36:52,990 --> 04:36:58,939
Yeah, but but I zap a guy in his house and slash him.

5286
04:37:03,310 --> 04:37:04,610
It's shocked.

5287
04:37:05,610 --> 04:37:13,069
Whatever to our health unlimited power.

5288
04:37:14,580 --> 04:37:15,979
Oh, that's really shitty.

5289
04:37:16,279 --> 04:37:16,880
That's shitty.

5290
04:37:16,880 --> 04:37:17,680
But you know what?

5291
04:37:17,880 --> 04:37:18,380
Let's go.

5292
04:37:19,819 --> 04:37:23,220
You open the cupboards in one you find a jar marked poison

5293
04:37:24,060 --> 04:37:26,560
and in another a jar labeled essence of bark.

5294
04:37:27,159 --> 04:37:28,459
This guy was poisoning me.

5295
04:37:28,459 --> 04:37:33,150
I think take him will take everything you clear out the

5296
04:37:33,150 --> 04:37:37,119
cupboard and take the bark to take everything you take a

5297
04:37:37,119 --> 04:37:37,419
care.

5298
04:37:37,419 --> 04:37:44,500
No, wait, what what what happened you take it?

5299
04:37:44,500 --> 04:37:45,599
I didn't know I wanted to take it.

5300
04:37:45,599 --> 04:37:46,299
I don't want to eat it.

5301
04:37:47,319 --> 04:37:49,020
You take a careful sip of the essence of bark.

5302
04:37:49,020 --> 04:37:52,020
It tastes like freshly cut grass, but seems harmless

5303
04:37:52,020 --> 04:37:52,319
enough.

5304
04:37:52,819 --> 04:37:55,119
Then you look down to see your skin turning green.

5305
04:37:57,599 --> 04:38:00,979
What I have green.

5306
04:38:00,979 --> 04:38:02,279
I'm have green skin.

5307
04:38:03,750 --> 04:38:08,189
Okay, hangings look like rich treasures from a much grander

5308
04:38:08,189 --> 04:38:10,189
household made of thick cloth.

5309
04:38:10,689 --> 04:38:13,490
They're exquisitely decorated with images of orcs and trolls

5310
04:38:13,790 --> 04:38:17,759
being hacked to pieces by a hero with two blades in a silver

5311
04:38:17,759 --> 04:38:18,259
crown.

5312
04:38:19,290 --> 04:38:24,090
One of the hangings has a specific this guy's like a hero.

5313
04:38:27,459 --> 04:38:30,659
I one of the hangings has a suspiciously large bulge

5314
04:38:30,659 --> 04:38:31,259
underneath it.

5315
04:38:31,560 --> 04:38:36,400
And as you watch the bulge move, you lift one of the

5316
04:38:36,400 --> 04:38:39,500
hangings uncovering a gigantic spider.

5317
04:38:40,270 --> 04:38:43,169
The arachnid jumps at you bearing its fangs and landing

5318
04:38:43,169 --> 04:38:44,169
on your chest.

5319
04:38:44,770 --> 04:38:45,770
Oh my God.

5320
04:38:52,240 --> 04:39:04,349
The giant giant could help me horsefield jig.

5321
04:39:08,220 --> 04:39:10,319
You cast the spell and cautiously draw the pipe out of

5322
04:39:10,319 --> 04:39:12,020
your pack and begin to play at first.

5323
04:39:12,020 --> 04:39:15,419
The spider seems unaffected and its legs begin to twitch

5324
04:39:15,919 --> 04:39:18,119
one after the other a moment later.

5325
04:39:18,119 --> 04:39:20,319
It is performing a horrific jumping dance across your

5326
04:39:20,319 --> 04:39:24,119
chest and arms and racing up and down your legs in excitement.

5327
04:39:25,529 --> 04:39:28,130
Finally, it darts to the top of your head and attempts a

5328
04:39:28,229 --> 04:39:31,130
backflip falls off and lands on the floor.

5329
04:39:32,450 --> 04:39:34,750
You stop playing and it hurries away into a crack in the

5330
04:39:34,750 --> 04:39:35,150
floor.

5331
04:39:35,549 --> 04:39:37,650
You let out an enormous sigh of relief.

5332
04:39:38,750 --> 04:39:40,150
I was hoping it was going to die.

5333
04:39:41,189 --> 04:39:43,590
I was hoping that it was attempts a backflip and like

5334
04:39:43,590 --> 04:39:44,490
lands on its head.

5335
04:39:49,319 --> 04:39:50,819
So stupid.

5336
04:39:52,080 --> 04:39:54,380
You're embarrassed that it's a all right search the body.

5337
04:39:55,950 --> 04:39:58,750
You search Van Gorn's pockets find eight gold pieces and

5338
04:39:58,750 --> 04:39:59,349
you take it.

5339
04:40:00,090 --> 04:40:02,189
You found all you will find here time to be moving on.

5340
04:40:02,389 --> 04:40:03,590
What did I pick up though?

5341
04:40:07,970 --> 04:40:08,970
Sun jewel band.

5342
04:40:09,069 --> 04:40:10,770
I got like bark essence, right?

5343
04:40:18,520 --> 04:40:21,119
Essence of bark poison.

5344
04:40:21,220 --> 04:40:22,619
I'm gonna be able to poison somebody.

5345
04:40:27,200 --> 04:40:28,700
You're bald and green.

5346
04:40:32,669 --> 04:40:34,970
I can't wait to poison somebody is gonna be so dumb.

5347
04:40:36,000 --> 04:40:37,299
I'm so looking forward to that.

5348
04:40:39,549 --> 04:40:39,849
All right.

5349
04:40:39,849 --> 04:40:41,950
We only one way we can go just this way.

5350
04:40:45,869 --> 04:40:48,669
You continue along the street which grows narrower the more

5351
04:40:48,669 --> 04:40:52,349
winding it becomes on either side.

5352
04:40:52,549 --> 04:40:55,950
Slum dwellings arise high faces appear and disappear behind

5353
04:40:55,950 --> 04:40:56,450
drapes.

5354
04:40:57,290 --> 04:41:01,919
Someone throws out a bucket of slop narrowly missing you very

5355
04:41:01,919 --> 04:41:04,119
chained up animals screech from balconies.

5356
04:41:04,119 --> 04:41:07,959
The Sun disappears from view a bucket of slop.

5357
04:41:09,909 --> 04:41:10,409
Okay.

5358
04:41:11,709 --> 04:41:12,610
I asked for directions.

5359
04:41:13,869 --> 04:41:15,369
Did you kill the protagonist?

5360
04:41:16,040 --> 04:41:16,439
Good.

5361
04:41:20,840 --> 04:41:21,439
Oh right.

5362
04:41:21,439 --> 04:41:22,639
It said I could get lost in here.

5363
04:41:22,639 --> 04:41:23,040
That's right.

5364
04:41:27,360 --> 04:41:27,759
Keep going.

5365
04:41:28,459 --> 04:41:29,959
You push forward climbing a gentle slope.

5366
04:41:29,959 --> 04:41:30,759
I'm not stopping.

5367
04:41:31,360 --> 04:41:32,360
I'm not getting lost here.

5368
04:41:36,400 --> 04:41:40,200
The lane gets narrower muck and foul water runs downhill

5369
04:41:40,500 --> 04:41:44,409
forming a sheen over the flagstone the walls either side

5370
04:41:44,409 --> 04:41:47,209
are now so close together that someone on the top floor has

5371
04:41:47,209 --> 04:41:51,209
laid planks across the alley to steal from the house opposite

5372
04:41:51,709 --> 04:41:54,310
or perhaps to steal their own things back.

5373
04:41:54,709 --> 04:41:55,709
It's hard to be sure.

5374
04:42:05,720 --> 04:42:19,900
What why big I could just get huge and walk around for fun.

5375
04:42:19,900 --> 04:42:20,599
I'm doing big.

5376
04:42:21,000 --> 04:42:26,720
You cast the spell quickly inflating to three times your

5377
04:42:26,720 --> 04:42:27,619
normal size.

5378
04:42:28,119 --> 04:42:33,369
You hear shutters and doorways slam closed on all sides or

5379
04:42:33,369 --> 04:42:39,139
take the plank off remove the plank you pluck the plank from

5380
04:42:39,139 --> 04:42:42,139
its place and shake free the robber who is clinging on to

5381
04:42:42,139 --> 04:42:43,040
the middle of it.

5382
04:42:43,439 --> 04:42:48,240
He cries out as he lands you toss the plank aside at him

5383
04:42:48,340 --> 04:42:51,840
and move away the road narrows further until you can barely

5384
04:42:51,840 --> 04:42:54,340
squeeze your giant form between the door frames on either

5385
04:42:54,340 --> 04:42:57,639
side and fight suddenly you reach a small Plaza.

5386
04:43:04,020 --> 04:43:08,020
There's a small open square with a dried up well at center.

5387
04:43:08,520 --> 04:43:12,020
This is a crossroads and side roads lead off to the left

5388
04:43:12,020 --> 04:43:12,520
and right.

5389
04:43:14,580 --> 04:43:15,279
Oh shit.

5390
04:43:17,020 --> 04:43:19,689
Look at the alleys you pause to look around the edge of

5391
04:43:19,689 --> 04:43:22,729
the square is nothing to distinguish one alleyway from

5392
04:43:22,729 --> 04:43:26,110
the other although you do see a line of what look like

5393
04:43:26,110 --> 04:43:30,180
blood drops heading right the giant spell fades and you

5394
04:43:30,180 --> 04:43:32,080
slowly shrink back to your normal size.

5395
04:43:32,979 --> 04:43:36,990
Okay, so I could look over all that the only thing the

5396
04:43:36,990 --> 04:43:40,130
alleys have in common is that they converge here once

5397
04:43:40,330 --> 04:43:42,830
presumably this well served all the people in this district

5398
04:43:43,330 --> 04:43:46,229
but perhaps there were too many people because now the

5399
04:43:46,229 --> 04:43:51,380
well seems dusty and dry toss a coin down the well look

5400
04:43:51,380 --> 04:43:56,259
down the well look down the well leading over the edge you

5401
04:43:56,259 --> 04:43:59,959
peer down into the depths of the well strange this well

5402
04:43:59,959 --> 04:44:02,860
seems to have handholds cut into its stones.

5403
04:44:03,500 --> 04:44:09,020
If you're good enough to climb down climb down the well

5404
04:44:09,020 --> 04:44:10,419
choose a road or toss a coin.

5405
04:44:18,779 --> 04:44:19,279
I'm down.

5406
04:44:22,639 --> 04:44:23,139
Let's do a coin.

5407
04:44:23,909 --> 04:44:26,009
You toss a coin down the well it falls and falls and

5408
04:44:26,009 --> 04:44:26,810
falls eventually.

5409
04:44:26,810 --> 04:44:28,709
There is a very tiny splash.

5410
04:44:32,139 --> 04:44:36,880
All right chat option one or option to my climbing into

5411
04:44:36,880 --> 04:44:37,479
the well.

5412
04:44:37,580 --> 04:44:39,180
Are we going to pick up a road?

5413
04:44:46,290 --> 04:44:46,689
What do you think?

5414
04:44:51,330 --> 04:44:53,130
I can't believe I zapped that guy in his own house.

5415
04:44:56,619 --> 04:44:57,720
We'll get the coin back.

5416
04:45:01,599 --> 04:45:03,000
We were just drinking ale.

5417
04:45:05,560 --> 04:45:07,560
The way it was written to he gasps.

5418
04:45:08,389 --> 04:45:14,220
Oh my I killed him in one slash undefeated Omega Lull.

5419
04:45:20,270 --> 04:45:23,470
All right, that's that's a majority climb in the well.

5420
04:45:25,139 --> 04:45:27,939
There's still daylight left in the lore of the unknown is

5421
04:45:27,939 --> 04:45:30,680
overpowering you swing yourself over the edge of the

5422
04:45:30,680 --> 04:45:34,580
well teetering for a unnerving moment above the long long

5423
04:45:34,580 --> 04:45:38,590
drop and you find the first of the hold with your feet and

5424
04:45:38,590 --> 04:45:42,470
begin to make your way down into the dark into the well.

5425
04:45:44,720 --> 04:45:46,520
I was that you just you just got Elden Ringed by the way.

5426
04:45:47,959 --> 04:45:50,759
Oh was that you just got Elden Ringed just making sure

5427
04:45:50,759 --> 04:45:56,819
you understand that it is you just got Elden Ringed the

5428
04:45:56,819 --> 04:45:58,319
climb is slow and cautious.

5429
04:45:58,979 --> 04:46:00,479
You cannot see the holds below you.

5430
04:46:01,540 --> 04:46:05,130
So you have to feel your way down after about 10 minutes

5431
04:46:05,529 --> 04:46:08,310
your arms are tiring suddenly you realize the position

5432
04:46:08,310 --> 04:46:11,909
you're in if your strength gives out you will fall which

5433
04:46:11,909 --> 04:46:14,209
you may not have the energy to climb back up either.

5434
04:46:14,939 --> 04:46:16,740
It is impossible to see how much further down there is

5435
04:46:16,740 --> 04:46:28,259
to go climb out get out keep going down stealing your

5436
04:46:28,259 --> 04:46:36,049
courage you continue to climb down a ledge after perhaps

5437
04:46:36,049 --> 04:46:40,099
a minute more your foot finds a ledge below that is

5438
04:46:40,099 --> 04:46:41,299
nothing but space.

5439
04:46:41,959 --> 04:46:44,459
You have reached the roof of whatever chamber is below

5440
04:46:45,200 --> 04:46:47,500
a metal bar sticks from the wall here presumably used

5441
04:46:47,500 --> 04:46:50,200
to tie a rope to to continue the rest of the way down.

5442
04:46:53,200 --> 04:46:53,700
What can we do?

5443
04:47:00,860 --> 04:47:04,790
I don't have whatever that whatever that is fall float

5444
04:47:04,790 --> 04:47:11,340
in the air fog creative force field something.

5445
04:47:11,340 --> 04:47:12,540
Why would I someone darkness here?

5446
04:47:18,229 --> 04:47:22,080
Is also sus is there also sun?

5447
04:47:22,479 --> 04:47:23,279
No, just us.

5448
04:47:27,220 --> 04:47:30,020
I mean floating in the air seems or force field.

5449
04:47:31,919 --> 04:47:32,720
That's a good move.

5450
04:47:33,020 --> 04:47:33,720
Is it expensive?

5451
04:47:34,889 --> 04:47:37,590
Not really, but I'm kind of I'm running out of stamina.

5452
04:47:41,040 --> 04:47:43,240
You cast a spell and feel yourself become as light as

5453
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:46,439
a feather and you release hold of the wall and float

5454
04:47:46,439 --> 04:47:49,220
gently down in the sewers.

5455
04:47:52,709 --> 04:47:56,689
I do have potions you're floating an inch or so above

5456
04:47:56,689 --> 04:48:00,590
thick water in one of the city sewers smell is indescribable

5457
04:48:00,889 --> 04:48:01,490
terrible.

5458
04:48:02,409 --> 04:48:05,409
You're at a dead end of sorts the water disappears into

5459
04:48:05,409 --> 04:48:08,450
a grating in one direction while the tunnel disappears

5460
04:48:08,450 --> 04:48:09,650
into darkness in the other.

5461
04:48:11,790 --> 04:48:14,849
I don't think we're going back up you step out from the

5462
04:48:14,849 --> 04:48:17,750
dim light of the well shaft and into the black tunnel

5463
04:48:17,750 --> 04:48:22,650
beyond I don't think there's any going back up drinks

5464
04:48:22,650 --> 04:48:24,650
and blimberry is the ape here.

5465
04:48:24,750 --> 04:48:24,950
Okay.

5466
04:48:24,950 --> 04:48:37,389
The ape is finally here one more.

5467
04:48:37,389 --> 04:48:37,990
No, that's fine.

5468
04:48:43,659 --> 04:48:45,360
Hold up a drink from the sewers.

5469
04:48:45,759 --> 04:48:46,560
Ella Mayo.

5470
04:48:47,459 --> 04:48:49,459
I think that that's like them.

5471
04:48:49,759 --> 04:48:50,360
What do you why is it?

5472
04:48:50,360 --> 04:48:56,669
That's not that's like the tunnel is filled with the

5473
04:48:56,669 --> 04:48:57,169
worst dent.

5474
04:48:57,169 --> 04:48:59,270
You can imagine things splash and scurry through the

5475
04:48:59,270 --> 04:49:03,720
darkness pass a heap of black cloth a huddled creature

5476
04:49:07,110 --> 04:49:11,599
investigate you creep over to the huddled rags the shape

5477
04:49:11,599 --> 04:49:15,819
of a man leaned over clutching his knees, but it does

5478
04:49:15,819 --> 04:49:27,450
not seem to be moving run it through touch it collapses

5479
04:49:27,450 --> 04:49:30,619
at just the slightest touch and you breathe a sigh of

5480
04:49:30,619 --> 04:49:33,020
relief just a piled up cloak.

5481
04:49:33,319 --> 04:49:35,419
Discarded by some previous unfortunate.

5482
04:49:35,720 --> 04:49:39,520
We traveled this way you sift through the heavy cloth.

5483
04:49:39,819 --> 04:49:42,599
This was a fine cloak once before it was left to rot

5484
04:49:42,599 --> 04:49:46,270
down here stitched on the back is a number one in a

5485
04:49:46,270 --> 04:49:49,229
circle waterlogged the cloak is too heavy to carry

5486
04:49:49,229 --> 04:49:50,830
away and has no pockets.

5487
04:49:50,930 --> 04:49:54,799
However, and no hidden gold, but it proves that others

5488
04:49:54,799 --> 04:49:59,720
have come this way before said that kind of wrong,

5489
04:49:59,819 --> 04:50:04,700
but whatever cloak with pockets that seems actually

5490
04:50:04,700 --> 04:50:05,400
pretty helpful.

5491
04:50:05,400 --> 04:50:06,500
I don't know why they didn't make them.

5492
04:50:10,110 --> 04:50:10,909
All right moving on.

5493
04:50:14,939 --> 04:50:16,139
I keep pausing to cough.

5494
04:50:17,259 --> 04:50:18,759
That's why you don't hear me for like a minute or

5495
04:50:18,759 --> 04:50:21,560
so to time sewer turns a corner here with the other

5496
04:50:21,560 --> 04:50:27,750
tunnels blocked by filth strewn wreckage you steal

5497
04:50:27,750 --> 04:50:30,349
yourself and dig through the foul filth in the wreckage

5498
04:50:30,349 --> 04:50:33,540
trying not to vomit from the stench you come across

5499
04:50:33,540 --> 04:50:38,259
a small glass bottle on Cork it and breathe it in.

5500
04:50:39,950 --> 04:50:42,680
It's blimbrary you stash it into your pack.

5501
04:50:42,779 --> 04:50:43,180
Oh hell.

5502
04:50:43,180 --> 04:50:44,479
Yeah, let's take it right now.

5503
04:50:54,080 --> 04:50:56,080
You walk onwards through the dark sewer and suddenly

5504
04:50:56,080 --> 04:50:58,080
the tunnel opens into a low chamber.

5505
04:50:59,509 --> 04:51:05,299
There's a chamber you stand ankle deep in filth in a

5506
04:51:05,299 --> 04:51:08,299
square chamber icy droplets fall from the ceiling.

5507
04:51:08,299 --> 04:51:09,700
The smell is terrible.

5508
04:51:10,619 --> 04:51:13,159
But this is not just any sewer in the corner of the

5509
04:51:13,159 --> 04:51:18,689
room is a pile of rags someone or something lives

5510
04:51:18,689 --> 04:51:25,459
down here search the rags look around the room or

5511
04:51:25,459 --> 04:51:47,340
leave search the rag you dig into the rags and clothing.

5512
04:51:47,840 --> 04:51:49,639
They must have formed someone's bedding as they

5513
04:51:49,639 --> 04:51:52,639
could never have been clothing strips and odd squares

5514
04:51:52,639 --> 04:51:53,939
of cloth of all different kinds.

5515
04:51:54,669 --> 04:51:56,770
They've probably been scavenged from what people

5516
04:51:56,770 --> 04:51:58,470
threw down the drains into the sewers.

5517
04:51:59,500 --> 04:52:03,340
Dig through them carefully digging into some old

5518
04:52:03,340 --> 04:52:04,740
pockets you find a few gold pieces.

5519
04:52:05,139 --> 04:52:07,819
Suddenly you find yourself itching and scratching the

5520
04:52:07,819 --> 04:52:11,020
rags are covered in fleas and now they are biting you

5521
04:52:11,020 --> 04:52:11,619
as well.

5522
04:52:12,349 --> 04:52:13,349
The thought occurs to you.

5523
04:52:13,349 --> 04:52:15,650
Perhaps this is not the hiding place of a beggar but

5524
04:52:15,650 --> 04:52:19,279
the nest of some terrible beast a sudden rush of

5525
04:52:19,279 --> 04:52:22,080
water floods the chamber soaking you up to the

5526
04:52:22,080 --> 04:52:23,680
waist a moment later.

5527
04:52:23,680 --> 04:52:26,279
It is washed away once more, but there might be more

5528
04:52:26,279 --> 04:52:26,779
coming.

5529
04:52:30,630 --> 04:52:40,099
What are we doing here one or two you pick some dude

5530
04:52:40,099 --> 04:52:43,299
just flush the toilet one or two look around the room

5531
04:52:43,299 --> 04:52:48,509
or walk on one or two one or two one or two one or

5532
04:52:48,509 --> 04:52:48,810
two.

5533
04:53:01,430 --> 04:53:02,130
What am I doing?

5534
04:53:04,150 --> 04:53:05,750
Okay, we're looking around the room.

5535
04:53:05,750 --> 04:53:16,659
Apparently never one to they get them.

5536
04:53:16,759 --> 04:53:20,450
Yeah one is running away with it 60% I just got here

5537
04:53:20,450 --> 04:53:21,450
this stream sucks.

5538
04:53:23,369 --> 04:53:25,610
No doesn't bud.

5539
04:53:32,000 --> 04:53:34,599
All right one wins one wins one wins by a lot.

5540
04:53:37,540 --> 04:53:39,639
I just got you just like you just open the stream

5541
04:53:39,639 --> 04:53:42,939
and type that you don't have any video for five

5542
04:53:42,939 --> 04:53:43,340
seconds.

5543
04:53:43,740 --> 04:53:44,639
Despite your concerns.

5544
04:53:44,639 --> 04:53:47,209
You stop to look around the walls of the chamber side

5545
04:53:47,209 --> 04:53:48,209
from the pile of rags.

5546
04:53:48,209 --> 04:53:49,110
There's nothing else here.

5547
04:53:49,409 --> 04:53:51,409
No stash of food or weapons and no sign of the

5548
04:53:51,409 --> 04:53:52,110
inhabitant.

5549
04:53:52,750 --> 04:53:54,950
Then you notice on the far wall some scratches in

5550
04:53:54,950 --> 04:53:57,509
the stone a mark of time.

5551
04:53:57,509 --> 04:54:00,939
Perhaps suddenly something growls in the darkness in

5552
04:54:00,939 --> 04:54:01,939
the tunnel behind you.

5553
04:54:02,240 --> 04:54:05,139
You look up to see a dark stooped shape approaching

5554
04:54:05,139 --> 04:54:05,639
fast.

5555
04:54:05,639 --> 04:54:19,150
It is a rat bear Gack.

5556
04:54:20,889 --> 04:54:22,889
God I wish we had a jewel.

5557
04:54:24,630 --> 04:54:25,630
There's also law.

5558
04:54:26,029 --> 04:54:26,930
Did it work last time?

5559
04:54:26,930 --> 04:54:27,529
I don't remember.

5560
04:54:28,430 --> 04:54:30,830
Oh kid create an illusion.

5561
04:54:32,669 --> 04:54:33,869
I could make an illusion.

5562
04:54:36,500 --> 04:54:37,599
Yeah, we can't talk.

5563
04:54:37,599 --> 04:54:38,700
We don't have the wig.

5564
04:54:46,360 --> 04:54:47,060
I'll do an illusion.

5565
04:54:49,979 --> 04:54:50,580
Let's do illusion.

5566
04:54:54,659 --> 04:54:56,459
You slip the bracelet around your wrist and cast

5567
04:54:56,459 --> 04:55:01,619
the spell summoning the force of illusion create a

5568
04:55:01,619 --> 04:55:05,000
fire a wall of water or an army.

5569
04:55:06,099 --> 04:55:15,299
Army I feel like wouldn't fire it'd be like like

5570
04:55:15,299 --> 04:55:20,080
run fire you create the illusion of a raging fire

5571
04:55:20,080 --> 04:55:22,680
as though the whole sewer was suddenly a crucible

5572
04:55:23,220 --> 04:55:25,319
the rat bear screams and terror and charges away

5573
04:55:25,319 --> 04:55:25,919
down the tunnel.

5574
04:55:27,959 --> 04:55:34,279
Okay, we have time now we can look at the marks you

5575
04:55:34,279 --> 04:55:36,180
make your way carefully around the cesspool in the

5576
04:55:36,180 --> 04:55:38,819
middle of the room the far side where the marks are

5577
04:55:38,819 --> 04:55:40,220
faintly visible in the gloom.

5578
04:55:41,299 --> 04:55:43,700
They're not just notches but letters and perhaps

5579
04:55:43,700 --> 04:55:46,569
once they were full words but have been worn away

5580
04:55:46,569 --> 04:55:49,669
by the floating water or else filled with slime and

5581
04:55:49,669 --> 04:55:53,930
dirt looks as though it might have been a poem read

5582
04:55:53,930 --> 04:55:58,470
the poem still shaking from your encounter with a

5583
04:55:58,470 --> 04:56:00,569
rat bear you steady your heartbeat and peer at the

5584
04:56:00,669 --> 04:56:01,669
markings on the wall.

5585
04:56:02,069 --> 04:56:03,569
You can make out the following through the muck

5586
04:56:05,909 --> 04:56:12,490
corgas grace one lock the deep inside the I bid

5587
04:56:12,490 --> 04:56:14,360
you there's nothing more to be done here.

5588
04:56:18,169 --> 04:56:19,770
If you ever wish to see daylight again, you got to

5589
04:56:19,770 --> 04:56:24,700
move on now you walk onwards through the sewer

5590
04:56:24,700 --> 04:56:27,700
shadowy shapes loom out of the darkness and disappear

5591
04:56:27,700 --> 04:56:34,229
as you move close you walk for what seems like an

5592
04:56:34,229 --> 04:56:36,930
hour maybe more tunnel tilts lower and lower.

5593
04:56:36,930 --> 04:56:39,330
Perhaps you are going underneath the river the

5594
04:56:39,330 --> 04:56:41,729
sound of fast rushing water fills the tunnel.

5595
04:56:49,029 --> 04:56:57,139
Zip oh we don't we can't zip.

5596
04:56:59,419 --> 04:57:12,599
Horsefield there is huff wind is how does a suss

5597
04:57:12,599 --> 04:57:18,869
to see the sunlight horsefield.

5598
04:57:18,869 --> 04:57:20,569
I'm going to put up I'm going to force field is

5599
04:57:20,569 --> 04:57:21,369
expensive though.

5600
04:57:30,759 --> 04:57:35,599
I'll try it nervously.

5601
04:57:35,599 --> 04:57:37,900
You cast your spell binding a tight horsefield

5602
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:38,700
around yourself.

5603
04:57:39,099 --> 04:57:42,400
It will not last for long, but should anything happen

5604
04:57:42,400 --> 04:57:45,000
soon the force field should protect you from the

5605
04:57:45,000 --> 04:57:46,669
worst of it that done.

5606
04:57:46,669 --> 04:57:48,369
You keep walking the sound of rushing water is

5607
04:57:48,369 --> 04:57:52,299
growing louder around a corner.

5608
04:57:54,349 --> 04:57:57,150
Suddenly you realize the sound is not coming from

5609
04:57:57,150 --> 04:57:58,950
close by the tunnel or through the walls.

5610
04:57:59,250 --> 04:58:02,549
The sound is coming towards you somewhere a wall

5611
04:58:02,549 --> 04:58:05,349
of water is approaching an old dam must have given

5612
04:58:05,349 --> 04:58:07,750
way and the river water is now flooding the tunnel

5613
04:58:10,529 --> 04:58:14,689
ready for aid sell shelter.

5614
04:58:14,689 --> 04:58:16,090
I have I have a force field.

5615
04:58:17,200 --> 04:58:18,099
Take a deep breath run for it.

5616
04:58:18,099 --> 04:58:18,599
Pray for aid.

5617
04:58:19,700 --> 04:58:20,700
We have the ape right now.

5618
04:58:21,200 --> 04:58:24,299
Wait, we have to read this strong beast intelligent

5619
04:58:24,299 --> 04:58:27,599
and prudent who takes great pride in acting faithfully

5620
04:58:28,040 --> 04:58:29,240
to be depended upon.

5621
04:58:29,240 --> 04:58:32,919
Okay, that's actually pretty good to have here.

5622
04:58:32,919 --> 04:58:41,700
I think or do we just eat it and I can still have

5623
04:58:41,700 --> 04:58:42,599
the ape if I need it.

5624
04:58:43,869 --> 04:58:48,240
I did just do three stamina worth of horsefield.

5625
04:58:49,290 --> 04:58:50,889
I'm just going to eat it take a deep breath.

5626
04:58:51,939 --> 04:58:52,840
There's nothing else for it.

5627
04:58:52,840 --> 04:58:55,340
You take a deep breath exhale take a deeper breath

5628
04:58:55,340 --> 04:58:57,939
exhale and then fill your lungs as best as you can

5629
04:58:57,939 --> 04:59:00,770
as the great wave strikes the water.

5630
04:59:00,770 --> 04:59:03,669
Wretches you from the floor and throws you into a

5631
04:59:03,669 --> 04:59:04,569
swirling spiral.

5632
04:59:04,770 --> 04:59:08,319
You can see nothing but the murk and the filth for

5633
04:59:08,319 --> 04:59:08,619
the moment.

5634
04:59:08,619 --> 04:59:11,319
At least you are calm and can focus focus even in

5635
04:59:11,319 --> 04:59:17,759
the roaring torrent from with the currents from

5636
04:59:17,759 --> 04:59:20,759
against the currents from down to escape the flow

5637
04:59:20,759 --> 04:59:29,979
swim up or a ceiling duct duct.

5638
04:59:30,580 --> 04:59:31,680
It's probably with the current.

5639
04:59:32,509 --> 04:59:34,009
Somebody said this is a rerun stream.

5640
04:59:34,110 --> 04:59:37,069
Yeah million followers man.

5641
04:59:37,169 --> 04:59:40,659
Come on good swim up for a ceiling duct.

5642
04:59:40,659 --> 04:59:46,520
The current is whipping you this way in the like

5643
04:59:46,619 --> 04:59:48,319
like a fetal bug in a thunderstorm.

5644
04:59:48,950 --> 04:59:51,549
It is all you can do to work out which way is up

5645
04:59:51,549 --> 04:59:53,349
and which way is down you fight and struggle to get

5646
04:59:53,349 --> 04:59:55,450
your body under control losing valuable seconds

5647
04:59:55,450 --> 04:59:55,849
of air.

5648
04:59:56,049 --> 04:59:59,930
Your force field has trapped some but it will soon

5649
04:59:59,930 --> 05:00:00,330
run out.

5650
05:00:01,319 --> 05:00:02,020
It's still on.

5651
05:00:02,220 --> 05:00:02,520
All right.

5652
05:00:02,520 --> 05:00:03,419
We got to get the right call here.

5653
05:00:04,450 --> 05:00:05,349
We got to get the right call.

5654
05:00:09,049 --> 05:00:11,250
So I'm still in the force field with his air in

5655
05:00:11,250 --> 05:00:11,549
here.

5656
05:00:11,549 --> 05:00:15,909
So I'm okay swim up or should I just let the

5657
05:00:15,909 --> 05:00:23,799
current go go with it go with it swim with the

5658
05:00:23,799 --> 05:00:28,200
current you swim with the current which tears you

5659
05:00:28,200 --> 05:00:30,400
along the length of the sewer the force field

5660
05:00:30,400 --> 05:00:33,459
protects you against bashes and knocks the ground

5661
05:00:33,459 --> 05:00:35,459
level is rising below at some point.

5662
05:00:35,459 --> 05:00:37,459
Perhaps you will break the surface of the water

5663
05:00:37,759 --> 05:00:38,860
but it has not happened yet.

5664
05:00:38,860 --> 05:00:42,880
Your lungs are bursting for air with the current

5665
05:00:43,869 --> 05:00:45,569
you swim with the current moving at breakneck

5666
05:00:45,569 --> 05:00:47,770
speed you cannot last much longer with the current

5667
05:00:47,770 --> 05:00:51,610
again you swim with the current moving at

5668
05:00:51,610 --> 05:00:53,909
breakneck speed only the air trapped inside your

5669
05:00:53,909 --> 05:00:55,509
force field is keeping you alive.

5670
05:01:00,389 --> 05:01:10,680
I don't know you swim up towards the roof of the

5671
05:01:10,680 --> 05:01:12,680
sewer hoping to find an air pocket to refresh your

5672
05:01:12,680 --> 05:01:15,919
breath but you're out of luck your force field

5673
05:01:15,919 --> 05:01:18,819
bashes the arched sewn ceiling which is fully

5674
05:01:18,819 --> 05:01:19,520
submerged.

5675
05:01:19,900 --> 05:01:22,200
Even the ducks running up are filled with water

5676
05:01:22,200 --> 05:01:23,500
there is no air to be had.

5677
05:01:23,799 --> 05:01:28,720
I'm like a fucking pinball with the current again

5678
05:01:30,220 --> 05:01:41,979
swim down from down you turn and fin down towards

5679
05:01:41,979 --> 05:01:43,580
the bottom of the sewer hoping to escape the

5680
05:01:43,580 --> 05:01:46,020
worst of the current near the ground the water

5681
05:01:46,020 --> 05:01:48,959
is slower and you are thrown about less violently

5682
05:01:49,500 --> 05:01:51,500
but despite the force field bubble around yourself

5683
05:01:51,500 --> 05:01:53,099
just still running out of air the air inside your

5684
05:01:53,099 --> 05:01:55,099
force fields running low in the spell itself won't

5685
05:01:55,099 --> 05:02:12,939
last much longer up up a duck against bro against

5686
05:02:12,939 --> 05:02:22,590
against against I got a force field on that you

5687
05:02:22,590 --> 05:02:24,790
pick this is the force field gave us like an

5688
05:02:24,790 --> 05:02:27,200
extra like three or four choices here one two or

5689
05:02:27,200 --> 05:02:28,799
three I really actually don't know I forgot I

5690
05:02:28,799 --> 05:02:31,529
don't remember one two or three.

5691
05:02:32,200 --> 05:02:36,959
This is probably the last shot here the force

5692
05:02:36,959 --> 05:02:37,959
field gave us extra time.

5693
05:02:37,959 --> 05:02:40,919
I think but this is this is a decision that needs

5694
05:02:40,919 --> 05:02:57,099
to be made one two three ducks are probably full

5695
05:02:57,099 --> 05:03:15,020
of water fray to the ape I could have what Chad

5696
05:03:15,020 --> 05:03:16,720
is going to choose the one that rose.

5697
05:03:18,029 --> 05:03:18,330
All right.

5698
05:03:18,330 --> 05:03:23,580
It's it's three swim up a duck lungs bursting you

5699
05:03:23,580 --> 05:03:26,720
reach a duck in the ceiling once inside it wrenches

5700
05:03:26,720 --> 05:03:29,880
you upwards with powerful force the stone work

5701
05:03:29,880 --> 05:03:33,180
either side is a blur and you crash scrape and

5702
05:03:33,180 --> 05:03:36,650
bang into the sides but harmlessly thanks to the

5703
05:03:36,650 --> 05:03:40,150
force field and suddenly you are spat up into a

5704
05:03:40,150 --> 05:03:44,340
wider colder water lit from above by silvery light

5705
05:03:44,950 --> 05:03:59,049
you are outside not dead you come up gasping for

5706
05:03:59,049 --> 05:04:03,220
air about a quarter of the way across the river

5707
05:04:03,220 --> 05:04:06,150
that flows through the middle of Kari night has

5708
05:04:06,150 --> 05:04:08,950
fallen while you were underground and all around

5709
05:04:08,950 --> 05:04:11,849
you is pitch darkness you struggle and flail for

5710
05:04:11,849 --> 05:04:13,650
a moment to get your head above water and then

5711
05:04:13,650 --> 05:04:15,950
turn about to swim for the far bank.

5712
05:04:16,520 --> 05:04:19,319
Of course all your water damageable possessions

5713
05:04:19,319 --> 05:04:23,479
have been ruined including your pictures of the

5714
05:04:23,479 --> 05:04:25,819
nobles of Kari thankfully.

5715
05:04:25,819 --> 05:04:27,919
However, the pages of your spellbook are protected

5716
05:04:27,919 --> 05:04:29,619
and your fleas are washed away.

5717
05:04:30,799 --> 05:04:37,979
What what got ruined what I need those clues.

5718
05:04:43,830 --> 05:04:48,080
What happened walking?

5719
05:04:48,279 --> 05:04:48,979
What did I lose?

5720
05:04:49,580 --> 05:04:50,380
Did I lose anything?

5721
05:04:54,000 --> 05:04:54,700
I'm okay, right?

5722
05:05:00,790 --> 05:05:02,090
I'm okay about the treasure.

5723
05:05:04,919 --> 05:05:06,020
I think I still have everything.

5724
05:05:08,369 --> 05:05:15,759
I didn't lose anything ever good swim forward.

5725
05:05:15,959 --> 05:05:18,599
Am I going to dive back under a swim forward you

5726
05:05:18,599 --> 05:05:20,500
swim along the surface of the river keeping your

5727
05:05:20,500 --> 05:05:23,799
mouth clear on the filth as best you can and aiming

5728
05:05:23,799 --> 05:05:26,900
for distant lights of the far bank is a figure

5729
05:05:26,900 --> 05:05:35,740
moving there a night watchman of some kind you

5730
05:05:35,740 --> 05:05:38,740
keep on swimming carving your way across quickly

5731
05:05:39,139 --> 05:05:42,840
keen to be out of the jibaji as soon as possible.

5732
05:05:43,860 --> 05:05:47,090
Suddenly a voice rings out across the river is

5733
05:05:47,090 --> 05:05:50,130
someone in the water man's voice calls.

5734
05:05:50,669 --> 05:05:54,549
What are the slaves is escaping one by one more

5735
05:05:54,549 --> 05:05:57,250
lanterns appear lighting up like stars as they

5736
05:05:57,250 --> 05:05:59,250
emerge from around the sides of the buildings

5737
05:05:59,450 --> 05:06:04,090
and down the narrow alleys to the waterfront shit

5738
05:06:09,340 --> 05:06:13,880
dive under you dive quickly under the water for

5739
05:06:13,880 --> 05:06:14,180
a moment.

5740
05:06:14,180 --> 05:06:17,689
You're alone isolated in the brown water and

5741
05:06:17,689 --> 05:06:20,990
something hisses past your face an arrow.

5742
05:06:21,090 --> 05:06:22,889
They're firing into the water.

5743
05:06:26,130 --> 05:06:28,130
I mean where where do I where do I go from here

5744
05:06:28,130 --> 05:06:29,630
rewind you lost the pictures.

5745
05:06:30,229 --> 05:06:31,529
I don't need those pictures.

5746
05:06:31,630 --> 05:06:43,250
Fuck them swim in circles to keep going from

5747
05:06:43,250 --> 05:06:47,840
Ford you keep swimming forward but no more arrows

5748
05:06:47,840 --> 05:06:48,240
strike.

5749
05:06:48,810 --> 05:06:51,009
Perhaps they have lost track of you in the water

5750
05:06:51,009 --> 05:06:53,110
since you're not swimming back as they might have

5751
05:06:53,110 --> 05:06:56,490
expected but forwards you move slowly and silently

5752
05:06:56,490 --> 05:06:58,790
coming up for air when you need to but breathing

5753
05:06:58,790 --> 05:07:01,659
only softly and gently after several minutes of

5754
05:07:01,659 --> 05:07:03,560
this you arrive at the far bank.

5755
05:07:04,970 --> 05:07:07,169
I mean check that it's safe you wait shivering in

5756
05:07:07,169 --> 05:07:09,069
the freezing cold water of the river.

5757
05:07:09,069 --> 05:07:10,669
But the men and their lanterns are a little

5758
05:07:10,669 --> 05:07:11,669
further along the bank.

5759
05:07:12,169 --> 05:07:13,470
You should be safe to climb out here.

5760
05:07:14,110 --> 05:07:17,209
You haul yourself up and pant gratefully in the

5761
05:07:17,209 --> 05:07:24,669
dark on the far bank look around in the darkness

5762
05:07:24,669 --> 05:07:27,069
the far bank is less populated than the near

5763
05:07:27,069 --> 05:07:27,470
bank.

5764
05:07:27,869 --> 05:07:31,040
There are no ins no market stalls just a single

5765
05:07:31,040 --> 05:07:33,340
path disappearing off into the darkness between

5766
05:07:33,340 --> 05:07:34,639
large stone buildings.

5767
05:07:35,380 --> 05:07:37,979
You're too tired from your swimming to walk on.

5768
05:07:38,450 --> 05:07:43,090
So you crawl under a bush and make camp you are

5769
05:07:43,090 --> 05:07:45,659
exhausted and could do with something to eat but

5770
05:07:45,659 --> 05:07:48,060
there is nothing you can do all of your food has

5771
05:07:48,060 --> 05:07:53,209
been ruined by the water time to get some rest you

5772
05:07:53,209 --> 05:07:55,110
close your eyes and are quickly asleep.

5773
05:07:55,880 --> 05:08:00,400
Your dreams are cluttered and crazy face after

5774
05:08:00,400 --> 05:08:05,139
face laughs as you ask about the spells for says

5775
05:08:05,139 --> 05:08:14,819
one there are 11 spells 1349 River water fills

5776
05:08:14,819 --> 05:08:17,299
your mouth and makes you choke but the water is

5777
05:08:17,700 --> 05:08:21,200
arriving with fishes each of which wants to tell

5778
05:08:21,200 --> 05:08:25,540
you its life story vangorn strides over and shakes

5779
05:08:25,540 --> 05:08:26,439
you by the hand.

5780
05:08:27,080 --> 05:08:29,380
Thank you for helping me realize the error of my

5781
05:08:29,380 --> 05:08:29,979
ways.

5782
05:08:30,380 --> 05:08:33,419
He says a moment later he sticks a dagger into

5783
05:08:33,419 --> 05:08:37,180
your lung a monk with the hooded eyes of a bat

5784
05:08:37,180 --> 05:08:39,880
throws a size a dice the size of a boulder towards

5785
05:08:39,880 --> 05:08:40,080
you.

5786
05:08:41,060 --> 05:08:44,060
Finally a black well mouth approaches and swallows

5787
05:08:44,060 --> 05:08:44,560
you whole.

5788
05:08:51,500 --> 05:08:52,000
Oh wow.

5789
05:08:52,000 --> 05:08:55,880
We just really cool.

5790
05:08:55,880 --> 05:08:58,979
Okay, that's one way that's yeah.

5791
05:08:58,979 --> 05:08:59,479
Okay, cool.

5792
05:09:00,080 --> 05:09:05,590
Next morning dawn comes and you are woken by the

5793
05:09:05,590 --> 05:09:07,590
shimmering light across the surface of the Jibaji

5794
05:09:07,590 --> 05:09:12,680
River by the idyllic morning is quickly broken as

5795
05:09:12,680 --> 05:09:14,180
the first of the boats begin to sail down the

5796
05:09:14,180 --> 05:09:17,180
river sailors cursing and singing filthy songs that

5797
05:09:17,180 --> 05:09:18,880
echo between the buildings are on either side.

5798
05:09:19,610 --> 05:09:21,610
You almost become accustomed to the terrible smell

5799
05:09:21,610 --> 05:09:21,810
here.

5800
05:09:22,959 --> 05:09:24,860
You follow the road away from the river towards a

5801
05:09:24,860 --> 05:09:25,959
fork in the road.

5802
05:09:31,630 --> 05:09:32,830
We're almost at the North Gate.

5803
05:09:36,970 --> 05:09:43,139
We're almost there right here.

5804
05:09:50,729 --> 05:09:51,930
Oh really?

5805
05:09:53,159 --> 05:09:54,060
We'll see what happens.

5806
05:09:54,759 --> 05:10:02,830
Who knows what happens in car the early morning

5807
05:10:02,830 --> 05:10:05,860
sun is beginning to wake the streets of Kare a few

5808
05:10:05,860 --> 05:10:09,029
creatures roam this way and that in one corner a

5809
05:10:09,029 --> 05:10:14,759
spring bubbles with fresh water drink cup your hand

5810
05:10:14,759 --> 05:10:15,959
to the water and drink a mouthful.

5811
05:10:15,959 --> 05:10:21,819
It is fresh and invigorating always drink the

5812
05:10:21,819 --> 05:10:23,959
water always drink from the water.

5813
05:10:26,639 --> 05:10:28,240
Are there any porta potties in this game?

5814
05:10:28,240 --> 05:10:30,569
Yeah, you missed it.

5815
05:10:30,569 --> 05:10:33,069
There was like there's like a 10 to 15 minute

5816
05:10:33,069 --> 05:10:36,889
ordeal where we shit in a porta potty and we had to

5817
05:10:36,889 --> 05:10:40,090
keep doing a way to find toilet paper and shit.

5818
05:10:41,080 --> 05:10:42,180
It was it's pretty cool.

5819
05:10:42,479 --> 05:10:50,299
It's a wild part of the adventure was disgusting.

5820
05:10:52,159 --> 05:10:55,590
Okay, look around looking left the road heads

5821
05:10:55,590 --> 05:10:58,090
through a into a residential area that seems well

5822
05:10:58,090 --> 05:11:00,889
cared for a short way off to the right is an open

5823
05:11:00,889 --> 05:11:01,389
Plaza.

5824
05:11:02,959 --> 05:11:05,599
We asked for directions you stop a passing creature.

5825
05:11:06,000 --> 05:11:06,599
Excuse me.

5826
05:11:06,900 --> 05:11:09,970
I need to ask you the creatures head is bowed doesn't

5827
05:11:09,970 --> 05:11:12,569
look up but it pulls itself free and hurries away.

5828
05:11:13,110 --> 05:11:14,509
It is too miserable to speak.

5829
05:11:15,689 --> 05:11:16,490
There's nothing for it.

5830
05:11:16,490 --> 05:11:29,110
You'll have to explore yourself or down where we

5831
05:11:29,110 --> 05:11:36,630
going to go you have a really distinct.

5832
05:11:36,630 --> 05:11:39,130
I'm making shit up on the spot voice.

5833
05:11:39,630 --> 05:11:44,279
What I'm reading it.

5834
05:11:44,580 --> 05:11:45,180
I'm reading it.

5835
05:11:45,180 --> 05:11:47,380
What do you mean making shit up on the spot?

5836
05:11:48,080 --> 05:11:48,979
What are you talking about?

5837
05:11:48,979 --> 05:11:49,779
What does that mean?

5838
05:11:51,840 --> 05:11:53,139
What does that mean?

5839
05:11:58,770 --> 05:12:02,169
I'm reading it from a this is a book.

5840
05:12:03,459 --> 05:12:05,159
He's talking about the porta potties.

5841
05:12:06,200 --> 05:12:09,400
What no, I don't I have a tell.

5842
05:12:14,209 --> 05:12:15,509
Do I actually have a tell?

5843
05:12:19,610 --> 05:12:25,360
Yes, you have a making shit up on the spot voice.

5844
05:12:26,319 --> 05:12:30,189
Fuck this dude is reading you like a book.

5845
05:12:30,189 --> 05:12:30,889
Yeah, whatever.

5846
05:12:30,889 --> 05:12:31,490
That's fine.

5847
05:12:33,540 --> 05:12:35,939
Yeah, you go into quote performance mode.

5848
05:12:39,939 --> 05:12:41,540
It's an obvious tell.

5849
05:12:41,540 --> 05:12:43,939
Well, maybe I'm doing it on purpose in a way in my

5850
05:12:43,939 --> 05:12:46,639
mind because I'm I want you to make I want to make

5851
05:12:46,639 --> 05:12:50,470
sure you know, I'm full of shit right subconsciously.

5852
05:12:50,470 --> 05:12:53,169
It's like it's a way for you to know that I'm completely

5853
05:12:53,270 --> 05:13:01,200
and totally fabricating this 50 come on vote only

5854
05:13:01,200 --> 05:13:02,900
500 of you have clicked it.

5855
05:13:03,200 --> 05:13:04,099
It's 5050.

5856
05:13:04,200 --> 05:13:06,799
It could be two of you in chat right now could decide

5857
05:13:06,799 --> 05:13:07,000
it.

5858
05:13:07,700 --> 05:13:09,500
This could come down to one person deciding where to

5859
05:13:09,500 --> 05:13:13,299
go up.

5860
05:13:13,299 --> 05:13:13,599
Okay.

5861
05:13:19,459 --> 05:13:19,759
Okay.

5862
05:13:20,159 --> 05:13:21,259
You got it going up.

5863
05:13:25,970 --> 05:13:28,770
You follow a narrow winding Street past shops and

5864
05:13:28,770 --> 05:13:29,270
stalls.

5865
05:13:29,849 --> 05:13:32,450
It's still early and there are not yet open but there

5866
05:13:32,450 --> 05:13:34,150
are stirrings from within the houses as the day's

5867
05:13:34,150 --> 05:13:37,520
activities begin a face appears at a window and seems

5868
05:13:37,520 --> 05:13:38,619
to watch you pass.

5869
05:13:38,619 --> 05:13:41,020
Although the creatures eyes are closed and you're not

5870
05:13:41,020 --> 05:13:46,319
sure that it actually notices you wave at the creature

5871
05:13:48,139 --> 05:13:50,740
you wave to the creature, but it does not react.

5872
05:13:50,740 --> 05:13:52,439
Its eyes are still closed.

5873
05:13:53,700 --> 05:13:55,799
Another similar creature stands in a doorway across

5874
05:13:55,799 --> 05:13:58,200
the street washing themselves from a bucket.

5875
05:13:59,110 --> 05:14:03,180
This one is thin and spinely with a long face not

5876
05:14:03,180 --> 05:14:06,479
exactly a human and not an elven either something in

5877
05:14:06,479 --> 05:14:13,560
between the art in this game is so good.

5878
05:14:13,659 --> 05:14:16,490
It's just so I can't even describe it.

5879
05:14:17,419 --> 05:14:19,319
Something just so off-putting about it, right?

5880
05:14:20,200 --> 05:14:21,200
It's so good.

5881
05:14:21,200 --> 05:14:23,869
It's so strange.

5882
05:14:26,950 --> 05:14:27,250
Okay.

5883
05:14:27,250 --> 05:14:30,549
It almost feels like a person didn't draw this right.

5884
05:14:33,750 --> 05:14:37,150
It almost feels like an otherworldly creature an

5885
05:14:37,150 --> 05:14:40,119
otherworldly being drew this not a person.

5886
05:14:43,139 --> 05:14:43,840
It's really cool.

5887
05:14:47,119 --> 05:14:47,319
All right.

5888
05:14:47,319 --> 05:14:48,220
Am I going to greet this?

5889
05:14:51,450 --> 05:14:57,049
Aliens are people, but I'm not like a human.

5890
05:15:02,009 --> 05:15:03,310
It looks almost AI generated.

5891
05:15:04,590 --> 05:15:07,959
Yeah, it's just so interesting and unique.

5892
05:15:07,959 --> 05:15:08,659
I mean, I love it.

5893
05:15:10,419 --> 05:15:11,919
It's Ian Livingston, right?

5894
05:15:12,419 --> 05:15:13,419
Let's see did all the artwork.

5895
05:15:15,880 --> 05:15:16,680
That's fantastic.

5896
05:15:16,680 --> 05:15:16,979
All right.

5897
05:15:17,080 --> 05:15:19,479
Oh, let's um, we're going to greet it.

5898
05:15:20,580 --> 05:15:23,279
You try to greet the washing creature, but it too has

5899
05:15:23,279 --> 05:15:24,180
its eyes closed.

5900
05:15:24,880 --> 05:15:27,080
Perhaps it is soaping its hair and doesn't want to

5901
05:15:27,080 --> 05:15:30,250
sting its eyes at the end of the road under a low arch

5902
05:15:30,250 --> 05:15:32,750
a group of youths are loitering talking and kicking

5903
05:15:32,750 --> 05:15:33,849
stones into the gutter.

5904
05:15:34,520 --> 05:15:36,419
They notice you and begin to point and talk amongst

5905
05:15:36,419 --> 05:15:41,759
themselves approach take a side street to avoid them

5906
05:15:41,759 --> 05:15:42,459
or look them over.

5907
05:15:45,389 --> 05:15:46,389
Let's look them over first.

5908
05:15:47,409 --> 05:15:48,810
You pause to look at them.

5909
05:15:49,479 --> 05:15:50,979
They too have their eyes closed.

5910
05:15:51,580 --> 05:15:54,479
Although somehow they have seen you or perhaps they

5911
05:15:54,479 --> 05:15:59,979
have only heard you one or two approach them or take

5912
05:15:59,979 --> 05:16:14,060
a side street and avoid them one or two this side of

5913
05:16:14,060 --> 05:16:14,959
the river is creepy.

5914
05:16:16,150 --> 05:16:16,849
Yeah, so far.

5915
05:16:22,810 --> 05:16:33,090
We're going to get jumped maybe everyone and everything

5916
05:16:33,090 --> 05:16:34,090
wants to kill you here.

5917
05:16:35,080 --> 05:16:36,279
Yeah, this place sucks.

5918
05:16:40,619 --> 05:16:42,520
We're going to approach 70% there's no way you're

5919
05:16:42,520 --> 05:16:47,409
going to hold that back approach a group of children

5920
05:16:47,409 --> 05:16:48,310
doesn't scare you.

5921
05:16:48,880 --> 05:16:50,580
You continue down the street towards them.

5922
05:16:50,979 --> 05:16:53,680
They fan out a little until they fill the width of

5923
05:16:53,680 --> 05:16:57,479
the narrow Road above you shutters are closing and

5924
05:16:57,479 --> 05:17:00,880
people move away from windows as though despite

5925
05:17:00,880 --> 05:17:01,479
their eyes.

5926
05:17:01,979 --> 05:17:06,259
They've seen a fight coming breathe them elbow my

5927
05:17:06,259 --> 05:17:07,560
way through close my eyes.

5928
05:17:08,439 --> 05:17:15,639
Hold on or cast a spell.

5929
05:17:18,189 --> 05:17:19,290
Let's see what we have available.

5930
05:17:26,180 --> 05:17:35,669
Okay, we have Goblin we can summon a Goblin is also

5931
05:17:36,270 --> 05:17:36,770
float.

5932
05:17:39,630 --> 05:17:45,650
There is hot of course mud which you don't have

5933
05:17:45,650 --> 05:17:46,549
access to anymore.

5934
05:17:50,959 --> 05:17:56,639
Dud which is treasure hot gigachad hot gigachad

5935
05:18:00,840 --> 05:18:11,259
Bob them sure cast the spell throwing down a Goblin

5936
05:18:11,259 --> 05:18:14,060
tooth as you do is a puff of smoke and then a moment

5937
05:18:14,060 --> 05:18:17,060
later a Goblin warrior stands before you saluting

5938
05:18:18,099 --> 05:18:21,000
order him to attack the youths order him to wait

5939
05:18:21,200 --> 05:18:25,479
go attack like the kids go attack the use or slip

5940
05:18:25,479 --> 05:18:38,139
past the youth what he's going to go what they

5941
05:18:38,139 --> 05:18:38,340
okay.

5942
05:18:38,340 --> 05:18:40,240
Wait above you despite their eyes.

5943
05:18:40,240 --> 05:18:47,610
They see a fight coming slip past what would he do

5944
05:18:47,610 --> 05:18:48,709
be like yeah, it's safe.

5945
05:18:51,540 --> 05:18:54,240
What is slipping past do I think he I think we're

5946
05:18:54,240 --> 05:18:55,439
going to send the Goblin.

5947
05:18:55,939 --> 05:18:58,639
And the Goblin will sneak by them and then wave and

5948
05:18:58,639 --> 05:18:59,939
say yeah, you can just do that.

5949
05:18:59,939 --> 05:19:01,240
They can't they're not going to be able to see you

5950
05:19:01,240 --> 05:19:12,450
or something right put a pole up one or two.

5951
05:19:12,549 --> 05:19:14,049
I'm not going to make this choice because they

5952
05:19:14,049 --> 05:19:14,450
either one.

5953
05:19:14,450 --> 05:19:26,639
I'm not sure I'm not going to make this decision.

5954
05:19:34,590 --> 05:19:36,090
We need stealth gameplay.

5955
05:19:37,520 --> 05:19:38,319
Yes, you do.

5956
05:19:47,700 --> 05:19:50,900
It's very it's as close remember one is attacked

5957
05:19:50,900 --> 05:19:54,220
to is slipped by this is a guy going to keep keep

5958
05:19:54,220 --> 05:19:54,819
this one open.

5959
05:19:56,459 --> 05:20:09,669
I don't know why fight.

5960
05:20:11,540 --> 05:20:12,040
I don't know.

5961
05:20:12,340 --> 05:20:13,439
It's going to be close.

5962
05:20:14,310 --> 05:20:15,810
This is too close to call.

5963
05:20:15,810 --> 05:20:17,310
It's going to come down to one person.

5964
05:20:18,720 --> 05:20:22,810
It's going to come down to one psychotic person

5965
05:20:23,409 --> 05:20:25,709
that is going to make it push over isn't it?

5966
05:20:25,810 --> 05:20:29,209
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5967
05:20:29,209 --> 05:20:30,509
Oh, no.

5968
05:20:33,229 --> 05:20:33,930
Oh, no.

5969
05:20:38,509 --> 05:20:41,110
You order the Goblin to attack and he marches off

5970
05:20:41,110 --> 05:20:44,209
towards the youth swinging his short stubby sword

5971
05:20:45,040 --> 05:20:47,240
the blade catches one of the men in the side who

5972
05:20:47,240 --> 05:20:50,959
gasps in pain and he does something from here.

5973
05:20:50,959 --> 05:20:53,950
You can't see what but a moment later your

5974
05:20:53,950 --> 05:20:57,049
Goblin has evaporated into a sudden burst of flame.

5975
05:20:58,479 --> 05:21:02,639
The youths laugh among themselves barbecued Goblin

5976
05:21:02,639 --> 05:21:04,439
me one asks no.

5977
05:21:04,439 --> 05:21:16,830
Thanks replies another he caught one of these kids

5978
05:21:16,830 --> 05:21:21,799
in the side and then they fucking grilled him.

5979
05:21:23,560 --> 05:21:24,060
What?

5980
05:21:31,060 --> 05:21:32,459
Well, I'm going to go talk to them.

5981
05:21:34,340 --> 05:21:35,740
They don't know where the Goblin came from.

5982
05:21:35,740 --> 05:21:37,939
But all they know some crazy guy just ran down

5983
05:21:37,939 --> 05:21:38,840
the street with a sword.

5984
05:21:39,319 --> 05:21:40,319
They don't know what came from me.

5985
05:21:52,159 --> 05:21:54,060
You approach the group boldly.

5986
05:21:56,200 --> 05:21:57,000
Good morning.

5987
05:21:57,439 --> 05:21:58,740
Get out of my way children.

5988
05:21:59,439 --> 05:22:00,439
You own this Street.

5989
05:22:00,439 --> 05:22:10,330
I see you own this Street.

5990
05:22:10,330 --> 05:22:12,439
I see you remark.

5991
05:22:12,979 --> 05:22:14,580
I see you are very powerful.

5992
05:22:16,080 --> 05:22:18,979
I wonder if you have any idea how powerful the youth

5993
05:22:18,979 --> 05:22:19,979
replies quietly.

5994
05:22:20,479 --> 05:22:21,779
Would you like to find out?

5995
05:22:32,939 --> 05:22:35,319
Yeah, my pleasure.

5996
05:22:35,720 --> 05:22:37,819
The youth opens his eyes and suddenly a streak of

5997
05:22:37,819 --> 05:22:40,220
burning fire shoots from under his eyelids scorching

5998
05:22:40,220 --> 05:22:44,090
your side you gasp in pain and he laughs then the

5999
05:22:44,090 --> 05:22:47,090
other creatures grab your arms from either side.

6000
05:22:47,459 --> 05:22:50,360
Don't struggle or we'll look at you all over.

6001
05:22:59,099 --> 05:23:00,900
You are marched away through the alleyways to a

6002
05:23:00,900 --> 05:23:02,599
building surrounded by a high wall.

6003
05:23:03,200 --> 05:23:04,000
It is a prison.

6004
05:23:05,439 --> 05:23:08,139
You're dragged across the yard and into an underground

6005
05:23:08,139 --> 05:23:11,639
corridor cell doors opened and you're thrown inside

6006
05:23:11,639 --> 05:23:14,139
landing squarely on top of another creature.

6007
05:23:20,400 --> 05:23:21,400
Should have drawn the sword.

6008
05:23:21,599 --> 05:23:23,200
I don't I think they would have got me.

6009
05:23:24,319 --> 05:23:25,319
You're throwing dude.

6010
05:23:28,799 --> 05:23:29,799
What do you mean throwing?

6011
05:23:31,880 --> 05:23:32,580
Who is this?

6012
05:23:32,979 --> 05:23:33,479
Hold on.

6013
05:23:34,340 --> 05:23:36,540
You pick yourself to your feet and dust yourself down.

6014
05:23:37,099 --> 05:23:39,700
Apologies friend you say to your cellmate.

6015
05:23:40,240 --> 05:23:44,130
It's an Elven he seems worn out and exhausted creature

6016
05:23:44,130 --> 05:23:44,930
nods to you.

6017
05:23:46,240 --> 05:23:48,340
Welcome to my little world.

6018
05:23:48,979 --> 05:24:12,130
He replies you ready your mind for a spell but

6019
05:24:12,130 --> 05:24:13,229
nothing happens.

6020
05:24:14,299 --> 05:24:16,000
The Elven laughs bitterly.

6021
05:24:19,299 --> 05:24:23,040
The walls are infused with minimite blood to stop

6022
05:24:23,040 --> 05:24:24,540
people getting out that way.

6023
05:24:25,369 --> 05:24:29,580
I would have used my own magic if it worked from the

6024
05:24:29,580 --> 05:24:30,880
sounds coming through the walls.

6025
05:24:30,880 --> 05:24:33,979
This is one of several cells all side by side.

6026
05:24:34,810 --> 05:24:38,450
You hear snores shouts and screams coming through

6027
05:24:38,450 --> 05:24:39,250
the stonework.

6028
05:24:42,419 --> 05:24:43,119
Pray to the ape.

6029
05:24:54,470 --> 05:24:56,549
Should I pray now or should I wait?

6030
05:25:02,849 --> 05:25:05,150
I kind of want to wait.

6031
05:25:05,250 --> 05:25:05,750
Who are you?

6032
05:25:07,180 --> 05:25:09,779
My name on the outside hardly seems to matter.

6033
05:25:10,490 --> 05:25:13,189
My name in here is number six and that'll be your

6034
05:25:13,189 --> 05:25:13,889
name too.

6035
05:25:14,529 --> 05:25:15,729
He points a bony finger.

6036
05:25:16,779 --> 05:25:17,779
It's written on the door.

6037
05:25:17,779 --> 05:25:21,740
See the cell is empty except for a bucket murmuring

6038
05:25:21,740 --> 05:25:22,439
an apology.

6039
05:25:22,939 --> 05:25:24,939
The Elven uses it for what it is for.

6040
05:25:29,900 --> 05:25:34,220
You're an Elven you say I've not met your kind before

6041
05:25:34,220 --> 05:25:35,220
but I know of you.

6042
05:25:36,150 --> 05:25:36,750
He shrugs.

6043
05:25:37,860 --> 05:25:41,360
Elvens are pretty annoying creatures, but that's not

6044
05:25:41,360 --> 05:25:42,860
what they locked me up here for.

6045
05:25:46,279 --> 05:25:47,080
What is this place?

6046
05:25:48,880 --> 05:25:50,880
This is the jail of the red eyes.

6047
05:25:51,799 --> 05:25:53,000
There's one outside.

6048
05:25:53,500 --> 05:25:56,099
He points at the guard whose face with eyes closed

6049
05:25:56,770 --> 05:25:58,069
fills the tiny porthole.

6050
05:25:59,630 --> 05:26:01,130
The smell from the bucket in the corner of the room

6051
05:26:01,130 --> 05:26:01,830
is quite terrible.

6052
05:26:01,830 --> 05:26:03,330
Why would you why do you need to tell me that?

6053
05:26:04,130 --> 05:26:05,130
What does that add to the story?

6054
05:26:05,330 --> 05:26:06,930
Like hey he's shit in this bucket by the way.

6055
05:26:06,930 --> 05:26:09,130
Just want to make sure you know this and you're

6056
05:26:09,130 --> 05:26:09,630
aware of it.

6057
05:26:12,279 --> 05:26:13,080
Why are you here?

6058
05:26:14,319 --> 05:26:17,020
You know, the Elven replies with a sigh of some

6059
05:26:17,020 --> 05:26:17,520
passion.

6060
05:26:18,450 --> 05:26:21,250
I've asked myself that every night since I was arrested

6061
05:26:21,250 --> 05:26:24,380
months ago and I still can't figure it out.

6062
05:26:25,369 --> 05:26:27,369
I didn't do anything to upset these people.

6063
05:26:28,099 --> 05:26:30,700
My only idea is that the red eyes aren't happy

6064
05:26:31,200 --> 05:26:33,599
unless they've got someone locked away.

6065
05:26:35,610 --> 05:26:37,650
Maybe now you're here.

6066
05:26:38,049 --> 05:26:42,970
They'll let me go or they'll let me go.

6067
05:26:45,750 --> 05:26:49,650
Yeah, that would be a good joke on their part.

6068
05:26:50,569 --> 05:26:52,470
You can see the creature's spirit has been quite

6069
05:26:52,470 --> 05:26:52,970
broken.

6070
05:26:57,290 --> 05:26:58,090
I'm gonna pray to the ape.

6071
05:26:59,209 --> 05:27:00,909
Come on ape help us.

6072
05:27:01,479 --> 05:27:03,479
Help us spirit of the ape.

6073
05:27:06,450 --> 05:27:09,419
You raise a prayer to the ape and as you finish

6074
05:27:09,819 --> 05:27:11,119
there's a tiny click.

6075
05:27:11,619 --> 05:27:14,119
The sound of a lock tumbler falling over.

6076
05:27:14,790 --> 05:27:17,590
The Elven's narrow eyes open wide as portholes.

6077
05:27:18,419 --> 05:27:20,119
You wait until the guard outside has turned his

6078
05:27:20,119 --> 05:27:21,419
back and then slide the door open.

6079
05:27:21,419 --> 05:27:23,419
He will not be looking the other way for long.

6080
05:27:24,279 --> 05:27:25,380
Don't put shit up.

6081
05:27:25,580 --> 05:27:28,810
Don't shit all over moving silently.

6082
05:27:28,810 --> 05:27:30,209
You pick up the bucket from the floor of the cell.

6083
05:27:30,209 --> 05:27:32,209
The Elven looks at you curiously but says nothing

6084
05:27:32,409 --> 05:27:33,310
but the bucket on his head.

6085
05:27:34,169 --> 05:27:36,669
You raise the bucket nice and high creeping forward

6086
05:27:36,669 --> 05:27:39,869
on tiptoes and then at the last possible moment

6087
05:27:40,169 --> 05:27:42,569
you bring it down quickly on the guard's head.

6088
05:27:43,240 --> 05:27:45,840
Unmentionable substances trickle down on his face

6089
05:27:46,500 --> 05:27:48,299
but for a moment he cannot see.

6090
05:27:49,610 --> 05:27:51,110
Drag him backwards into the cell.

6091
05:27:51,720 --> 05:27:52,419
Run him through.

6092
05:27:53,180 --> 05:27:55,380
Drawing your sword you slice quickly through his

6093
05:27:55,380 --> 05:27:55,779
neck.

6094
05:27:56,880 --> 05:27:58,380
This is such a terrible way to die.

6095
05:27:59,080 --> 05:28:02,180
The Elven looks shocked but only for a moment then

6096
05:28:02,180 --> 05:28:09,060
he nods seriously when the others find him.

6097
05:28:09,599 --> 05:28:12,299
Be sure they will come for us unless we're gone.

6098
05:28:12,970 --> 05:28:13,569
You nod.

6099
05:28:13,569 --> 05:28:14,470
He is quite right.

6100
05:28:14,470 --> 05:28:15,470
Time to run for it.

6101
05:28:17,290 --> 05:28:19,590
You race up a set of stairs heading towards a patch

6102
05:28:19,590 --> 05:28:22,290
of sunlight and emerge in an alleyway on the other

6103
05:28:22,290 --> 05:28:23,290
side of the prison wall.

6104
05:28:23,689 --> 05:28:24,689
The Elven at your back.

6105
05:28:26,000 --> 05:28:28,099
I didn't even I didn't have to dump shit on the guy.

6106
05:28:28,500 --> 05:28:29,400
Why did I do that?

6107
05:28:32,430 --> 05:28:36,029
I dumped, by the way, this was a fresh bucket of

6108
05:28:36,029 --> 05:28:36,330
shit.

6109
05:28:36,330 --> 05:28:38,430
This guy, the Elven just did it.

6110
05:28:39,099 --> 05:28:41,799
This wasn't oh, you know, it's been like a few days.

6111
05:28:42,299 --> 05:28:45,099
He just dropped a fucking huge log in this thing

6112
05:28:45,299 --> 05:28:46,200
and it was probably hot.

6113
05:28:46,770 --> 05:28:51,590
It was a hot new shit that I dumped on his head and

6114
05:28:51,590 --> 05:28:52,889
then I slit his throat.

6115
05:28:59,000 --> 05:29:00,799
That added extra steps.

6116
05:29:01,200 --> 05:29:03,200
We didn't have to do the extra steps, right?

6117
05:29:03,830 --> 05:29:04,630
Just kill him.

6118
05:29:04,630 --> 05:29:05,430
Run him through.

6119
05:29:07,790 --> 05:29:08,889
That was disgusting.

6120
05:29:09,779 --> 05:29:12,340
300 people left the stream because of that.

6121
05:29:14,060 --> 05:29:16,659
You emerge onto a quiet side street and begin to

6122
05:29:16,659 --> 05:29:18,259
weave and duck through the alleyways.

6123
05:29:18,869 --> 05:29:21,869
The Elven weak from his long stay in the tiny cell

6124
05:29:21,869 --> 05:29:24,240
can barely keep pace with you but is filled with

6125
05:29:24,240 --> 05:29:27,540
such joy to be free that he laughs even as he trips

6126
05:29:27,540 --> 05:29:28,240
and stumbles.

6127
05:29:33,220 --> 05:29:33,919
We got a new friend.

6128
05:29:36,759 --> 05:29:37,360
One or two.

6129
05:29:38,159 --> 05:29:39,759
Time to decide.

6130
05:29:40,619 --> 05:29:42,919
I am imagining it's going to be right or left here,

6131
05:29:42,919 --> 05:29:43,319
right?

6132
05:29:43,520 --> 05:29:45,529
So I'm not sure.

6133
05:29:46,900 --> 05:29:47,599
One or two.

6134
05:29:47,700 --> 05:29:48,400
One is right.

6135
05:29:48,700 --> 05:29:49,299
Two is left.

6136
05:29:49,299 --> 05:29:50,000
One or two.

6137
05:29:54,259 --> 05:29:55,759
I don't think that was solid, man.

6138
05:30:01,439 --> 05:30:02,740
Yeah, the ape came through.

6139
05:30:03,279 --> 05:30:06,400
I wonder, I don't remember if you don't, if you've

6140
05:30:06,400 --> 05:30:08,950
already prayed because you can just pray to get

6141
05:30:08,950 --> 05:30:11,650
healed or pray in a few other scenarios.

6142
05:30:11,849 --> 05:30:12,750
I wonder what happens.

6143
05:30:18,860 --> 05:30:20,560
Yeah, to be depended upon.

6144
05:30:21,040 --> 05:30:22,340
The ape is probably one of the better ones to have.

6145
05:30:31,770 --> 05:30:33,970
You idiots are going to go back to the same place

6146
05:30:33,970 --> 05:30:35,270
where people, where we got caught.

6147
05:30:37,380 --> 05:30:40,560
We just go right back to the people with the eyes.

6148
05:30:40,860 --> 05:30:42,659
We just get put back in jail again and there's no

6149
05:30:42,659 --> 05:30:43,159
more ape.

6150
05:31:00,680 --> 05:31:01,779
We're doing the comedy route.

6151
05:31:01,880 --> 05:31:02,180
Yeah.

6152
05:31:03,450 --> 05:31:04,150
We're going left.

6153
05:31:05,299 --> 05:31:08,270
At the first junction, you turn left.

6154
05:31:08,470 --> 05:31:09,970
Do you know where you're going?

6155
05:31:10,270 --> 05:31:12,369
Ask the Elven, but there isn't time to reply.

6156
05:31:13,270 --> 05:31:13,770
Shit.

6157
05:31:15,400 --> 05:31:17,099
Again, again, again, again.

6158
05:31:17,099 --> 05:31:17,799
Where are we going?

6159
05:31:17,799 --> 05:31:18,500
One or two.

6160
05:31:27,740 --> 05:31:29,439
Do you know where you're going?

6161
05:31:30,779 --> 05:31:32,279
All right, I'm going to go left and then we're going

6162
05:31:32,279 --> 05:31:32,680
to go left.

6163
05:31:32,680 --> 05:31:33,479
We're going to go left again.

6164
05:31:33,979 --> 05:31:35,580
And then we're going to get burnt by the eye people.

6165
05:31:45,209 --> 05:31:46,310
Going to go into a circle.

6166
05:31:46,310 --> 05:31:51,380
Yeah, you're legit going to end up at the entrance.

6167
05:31:54,459 --> 05:31:56,159
Wait, right.

6168
05:31:56,259 --> 05:31:57,259
Okay, we're going right.

6169
05:31:59,080 --> 05:32:00,479
At the next junction, you go right.

6170
05:32:01,279 --> 05:32:02,680
The Elven is flagging.

6171
05:32:03,119 --> 05:32:04,919
He cannot keep running like this anymore.

6172
05:32:05,779 --> 05:32:06,380
Go on.

6173
05:32:08,810 --> 05:32:09,610
I'll hide here.

6174
05:32:10,919 --> 05:32:11,919
Leave him or help him.

6175
05:32:14,020 --> 05:32:14,919
You got to help the bro.

6176
05:32:15,119 --> 05:32:15,520
Help him.

6177
05:32:15,619 --> 05:32:16,720
Help, help, help him.

6178
05:32:17,990 --> 05:32:19,090
You're nearly free.

6179
05:32:19,490 --> 05:32:21,490
You reply, grabbing the Elven under his arm.

6180
05:32:22,669 --> 05:32:23,569
I mean it.

6181
05:32:25,200 --> 05:32:26,400
I'll hide you idiot.

6182
05:32:27,389 --> 05:32:29,689
While you distract any more guards with your running,

6183
05:32:29,689 --> 05:32:30,389
now go.

6184
05:32:32,880 --> 05:32:33,580
Good plan.

6185
05:32:33,979 --> 05:32:34,380
Leave him.

6186
05:32:37,569 --> 05:32:37,970
Good plan.

6187
05:32:40,900 --> 05:32:41,299
Good plan.

6188
05:32:41,299 --> 05:32:41,799
Good plan.

6189
05:32:41,799 --> 05:32:42,200
Good plan.

6190
05:32:43,959 --> 05:32:45,060
It would have been.

6191
05:32:45,360 --> 05:32:48,060
The Elven replies and you turn to see he's quite right.

6192
05:32:48,459 --> 05:32:50,560
Another guard has entered the alley behind you.

6193
05:32:51,159 --> 05:32:55,099
He opens his eyes and a moment later, the staggering Elven

6194
05:32:55,099 --> 05:32:55,799
is no more.

6195
05:32:56,619 --> 05:32:59,220
The stench of burning flesh fills your nostrils.

6196
05:33:00,400 --> 05:33:01,599
You race out of the alley.

6197
05:33:03,770 --> 05:33:06,709
Quite suddenly you emerge out of the side street into a

6198
05:33:06,709 --> 05:33:10,680
wide square filled with more red eyes, but these ones seem

6199
05:33:10,680 --> 05:33:12,279
like citizens rather than guards.

6200
05:33:13,169 --> 05:33:19,689
We killed him.

6201
05:33:19,790 --> 05:33:20,389
Save him.

6202
05:33:20,389 --> 05:33:21,189
So dumb.

6203
05:33:21,189 --> 05:33:21,889
LOL.

6204
05:33:24,509 --> 05:33:25,709
We got him killed.

6205
05:33:26,340 --> 05:33:32,560
I don't think I should I use a rewind on this?

6206
05:33:32,659 --> 05:33:33,659
I only got two more.

6207
05:33:34,479 --> 05:33:36,180
This one would be legit by the way.

6208
05:33:39,599 --> 05:33:40,099
We'll try.

6209
05:33:40,099 --> 05:33:40,700
We'll try again.

6210
05:33:40,799 --> 05:33:41,299
Let's try again.

6211
05:33:44,470 --> 05:33:45,569
I'm using my second rewind.

6212
05:33:46,430 --> 05:33:46,630
All right.

6213
05:33:46,630 --> 05:33:47,229
It was turn.

6214
05:33:47,229 --> 05:33:48,529
Wait, should we do this differently?

6215
05:33:49,479 --> 05:33:50,880
Turn left and then turn right, right?

6216
05:33:57,659 --> 05:33:58,459
And then right.

6217
05:34:04,849 --> 05:34:07,340
Okay, so I'm just going to leave him.

6218
05:34:09,439 --> 05:34:10,240
He gaps several.

6219
05:34:10,240 --> 05:34:10,840
I'll hide here.

6220
05:34:10,840 --> 05:34:12,959
Leave, leave, leave, leave.

6221
05:34:13,950 --> 05:34:15,250
You do not need to be asked twice.

6222
05:34:15,450 --> 05:34:16,950
You wish him luck and then hurry away.

6223
05:34:17,430 --> 05:34:19,930
The Elven crawls into a pile of junk and beds down.

6224
05:34:20,619 --> 05:34:22,619
Perhaps you will see him again.

6225
05:34:23,900 --> 05:34:24,400
Saved.

6226
05:34:28,099 --> 05:34:28,599
Now what?

6227
05:34:32,430 --> 05:34:33,029
Now what?

6228
05:34:33,430 --> 05:34:35,029
We're not out of this.

6229
05:34:36,279 --> 05:34:36,979
One or two.

6230
05:34:37,520 --> 05:34:38,220
One is right.

6231
05:34:38,319 --> 05:34:38,919
Two is left.

6232
05:34:39,610 --> 05:34:40,310
Choose quickly.

6233
05:34:58,080 --> 05:34:59,180
Can you hide with him?

6234
05:34:59,880 --> 05:35:00,380
I don't.

6235
05:35:00,580 --> 05:35:01,279
I don't know.

6236
05:35:04,250 --> 05:35:05,250
This shit is tight.

6237
05:35:09,360 --> 05:35:10,259
This is sorcery.

6238
05:35:11,189 --> 05:35:12,790
I tell you it's fun.

6239
05:35:18,450 --> 05:35:19,349
All right, we're going left.

6240
05:35:20,270 --> 05:35:21,669
You keep running taking a left.

6241
05:35:21,770 --> 05:35:24,069
Quite suddenly you emerge out from the alleyway into a

6242
05:35:24,069 --> 05:35:25,069
wider busier street.

6243
05:35:25,069 --> 05:35:27,169
You slow yourself to a nonchalant walk.

6244
05:35:28,569 --> 05:35:29,069
We made it.

6245
05:35:32,970 --> 05:35:33,470
Made it.

6246
05:35:33,970 --> 05:35:37,779
We're out.

6247
05:35:38,380 --> 05:35:39,080
Wait, are we?

6248
05:35:40,200 --> 05:35:42,700
The road turns and heads roughly southeast once more.

6249
05:35:43,080 --> 05:35:44,180
But you have been stopped.

6250
05:35:44,709 --> 05:35:48,610
Spotted by a group of young orklings and they're scurrying

6251
05:35:48,610 --> 05:35:49,310
towards you.

6252
05:35:56,630 --> 05:36:00,909
Okay, hurry to avoid them or wait for them to reach me.

6253
05:36:02,250 --> 05:36:03,549
One or two quick again.

6254
05:36:03,650 --> 05:36:04,750
I mean, I don't know what to do here.

6255
05:36:04,750 --> 05:36:05,450
What do I want to do?

6256
05:36:06,119 --> 05:36:06,720
Dude, hold on.

6257
05:36:06,720 --> 05:36:10,299
I just had this insane urge for a one steak sauce.

6258
05:36:10,299 --> 05:36:10,900
I don't know why.

6259
05:36:11,200 --> 05:36:12,200
Just it just popped in my brain.

6260
05:36:12,200 --> 05:36:13,500
That sour kind of flavor.

6261
05:36:14,060 --> 05:36:14,860
I want it so bad.

6262
05:36:14,860 --> 05:36:15,459
I don't know why.

6263
05:36:16,389 --> 05:36:16,790
Oh my God.

6264
05:36:16,790 --> 05:36:18,790
I want it so bad right now.

6265
05:36:18,790 --> 05:36:19,889
I want it so badly.

6266
05:36:28,240 --> 05:36:28,939
Just the sauce.

6267
05:36:28,939 --> 05:36:31,240
I just yeah, I just want to dig tap tap tap tap tap with

6268
05:36:31,240 --> 05:36:34,040
my pinky and dab dab dab dab dab on the top of my tongue.

6269
05:36:34,340 --> 05:36:34,740
That's it.

6270
05:36:47,720 --> 05:36:48,520
It's our turn.

6271
05:36:48,520 --> 05:36:49,119
Silence.

6272
05:36:49,119 --> 05:36:51,189
I'm you're going all right.

6273
05:36:51,189 --> 05:36:53,689
What one hurry and avoid them.

6274
05:36:53,689 --> 05:36:54,689
I think that's what's going to happen.

6275
05:36:54,689 --> 05:36:56,389
Let's go hurry and avoid them.

6276
05:36:57,569 --> 05:37:00,369
You increase your stride hoping to breeze straight past but

6277
05:37:00,369 --> 05:37:03,369
the gang is a big enough for them to easily block the road.

6278
05:37:03,669 --> 05:37:05,069
You're soon right in their midst.

6279
05:37:05,169 --> 05:37:07,369
Their hands poke at you and push outwards hoping for a

6280
05:37:07,369 --> 05:37:07,869
donation.

6281
05:37:10,880 --> 05:37:22,750
Look at someone a goblin.

6282
05:37:23,049 --> 05:37:23,250
All right.

6283
05:37:23,250 --> 05:37:25,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6284
05:37:25,150 --> 05:37:25,849
What else is there?

6285
05:37:27,529 --> 05:37:28,729
Create a force field.

6286
05:37:28,729 --> 05:37:29,830
They can't like touch me.

6287
05:37:33,209 --> 05:37:35,310
Oh treasure would be huge here.

6288
05:37:35,509 --> 05:37:36,610
That I would absolutely work.

6289
05:37:38,119 --> 05:37:39,220
Why would I read their minds?

6290
05:37:39,220 --> 05:37:40,720
I know that they're trying to get okay.

6291
05:37:41,619 --> 05:37:43,220
Another goblin or should we do the treasure?

6292
05:37:49,279 --> 05:37:50,080
Is there also s?

6293
05:37:51,409 --> 05:37:53,409
Ooh, I can clone myself.

6294
05:37:54,110 --> 05:37:54,810
I have six of me.

6295
05:37:58,569 --> 05:37:59,970
The goblins gonna get wrecked.

6296
05:38:04,360 --> 05:38:06,459
Yeah, they're gonna just swarm the goblin and kill him.

6297
05:38:06,560 --> 05:38:06,860
All right.

6298
05:38:07,900 --> 05:38:09,200
Treasure makes the most sense here.

6299
05:38:09,200 --> 05:38:09,799
It just does.

6300
05:38:11,930 --> 05:38:12,830
Why would you do treasure?

6301
05:38:13,630 --> 05:38:14,229
Because they're there.

6302
05:38:14,330 --> 05:38:15,830
It says they want a donation.

6303
05:38:15,930 --> 05:38:17,830
It's like they're trying to like poke me and prod me.

6304
05:38:17,830 --> 05:38:19,919
It says so.

6305
05:38:19,919 --> 05:38:22,720
I mean if I put like a million dollars on the ground that

6306
05:38:23,020 --> 05:38:23,619
it's gonna be fine.

6307
05:38:28,619 --> 05:38:29,520
Or how wait how much is it?

6308
05:38:29,520 --> 05:38:30,319
What are they looking for?

6309
05:38:31,459 --> 05:38:32,560
Throw a gold piece.

6310
05:38:33,159 --> 05:38:40,970
Give throw a gold piece away with throw the gold that okay.

6311
05:38:40,970 --> 05:38:41,669
That would work too.

6312
05:38:43,279 --> 05:38:43,880
I have money.

6313
05:38:46,150 --> 05:38:47,250
They're not gonna like that.

6314
05:38:49,490 --> 05:38:49,889
Throw it.

6315
05:38:50,389 --> 05:38:51,090
This is so...

6316
05:38:53,750 --> 05:38:54,250
Dud?

6317
05:38:56,459 --> 05:38:58,060
How much is Dud three stamina or one?

6318
05:39:04,000 --> 05:39:04,599
Let's see what happens.

6319
05:39:09,029 --> 05:39:11,529
You cast the spell and piles of gold and treasure spill from

6320
05:39:11,529 --> 05:39:13,830
the sleeves of your jacket and all over the road.

6321
05:39:14,430 --> 05:39:17,529
The orklings go instantly into a frenzy of collection running

6322
05:39:17,529 --> 05:39:19,930
over each other and beating each other up stuffing handfuls

6323
05:39:19,930 --> 05:39:21,130
of gems in their tunics.

6324
05:39:21,630 --> 05:39:22,930
You take the opportunity to slip away.

6325
05:39:26,040 --> 05:39:26,540
I okay.

6326
05:39:26,540 --> 05:39:28,240
I feel like they were gonna attack me.

6327
05:39:30,520 --> 05:39:30,819
All right.

6328
05:39:33,360 --> 05:39:34,560
It says they were beating each other up.

6329
05:39:37,889 --> 05:39:38,790
They were children.

6330
05:39:39,529 --> 05:39:40,029
What?

6331
05:39:40,970 --> 05:39:43,770
We were some of the goblin and the goblin would have

6332
05:39:43,970 --> 05:39:45,069
the goblin would have swung at him.

6333
05:39:45,069 --> 05:39:45,669
I'm sorry.

6334
05:39:45,869 --> 05:39:47,869
The goblin would have just you saw what happened when I sent

6335
05:39:47,869 --> 05:39:49,770
the goblin to a group of children.

6336
05:39:49,869 --> 05:39:50,270
Okay.

6337
05:39:50,770 --> 05:39:54,569
Last time a goblin was sent to a group of children.

6338
05:39:55,270 --> 05:39:57,770
A sword went into one of the kids sides.

6339
05:39:57,869 --> 05:40:02,759
Okay, you continue up the road leaving the chattering

6340
05:40:02,759 --> 05:40:04,759
orklings behind after a short distance.

6341
05:40:04,759 --> 05:40:06,860
You come across a large building made of stones and

6342
05:40:06,860 --> 05:40:07,259
mortar.

6343
05:40:08,860 --> 05:40:09,459
Look at the building.

6344
05:40:11,119 --> 05:40:14,319
It stands alone inside its own patch of grounds and

6345
05:40:14,319 --> 05:40:17,419
unusually it seems to be in a state of good repair.

6346
05:40:18,020 --> 05:40:22,000
A large L is carved on one gate post made road and

6347
05:40:22,000 --> 05:40:23,299
continue straight past the house.

6348
05:40:25,150 --> 05:40:27,150
I think I remember this part.

6349
05:40:30,930 --> 05:40:31,729
We going in.

6350
05:40:31,830 --> 05:40:32,430
Oh, it's good.

6351
05:40:32,430 --> 05:40:33,330
We're going in right.

6352
05:40:34,529 --> 05:40:46,729
I think I know this part and what I remember you enter

6353
05:40:46,729 --> 05:40:49,569
the gate and follow the path to the front of the house

6354
05:40:49,569 --> 05:40:51,470
between tall well-attended trees.

6355
05:40:51,939 --> 05:40:54,840
This place unlike the mansion in lower care seems quite

6356
05:40:54,840 --> 05:40:55,540
lived in.

6357
05:40:59,580 --> 05:41:01,779
All right, we got creep around the side or right in the

6358
05:41:01,779 --> 05:41:06,080
front door creep around the side is going to be one front

6359
05:41:06,080 --> 05:41:08,580
door will be to 30 seconds on the clock.

6360
05:41:08,580 --> 05:41:09,380
Let's get a pole going.

6361
05:41:15,479 --> 05:41:18,080
Oh German imagine having an opinion on that on a goblins

6362
05:41:18,080 --> 05:41:19,779
because one Goblin stabbed a kid.

6363
05:41:21,580 --> 05:41:21,880
Hold on.

6364
05:41:21,880 --> 05:41:22,779
I get a sneeze again.

6365
05:41:36,419 --> 05:41:37,520
You told him to do that.

6366
05:41:37,919 --> 05:41:38,819
I didn't tell him to do that.

6367
05:41:38,819 --> 05:41:39,319
You did.

6368
05:41:39,619 --> 05:41:40,819
So don't put that on me.

6369
05:41:44,729 --> 05:41:46,330
I didn't tell him to do anything actually.

6370
05:41:53,700 --> 05:41:57,380
All right, we're going to the front door the door to

6371
05:41:57,380 --> 05:41:58,880
the house is solid oak wood.

6372
05:41:59,380 --> 05:42:01,779
Decorated with elaborate carvings of vines and trees

6373
05:42:01,779 --> 05:42:05,479
and serpents in the middle is a great brass knocker.

6374
05:42:09,009 --> 05:42:13,709
You firmly knock on the door, but no one answers how seems

6375
05:42:13,709 --> 05:42:14,909
empty dark and quiet.

6376
05:42:24,240 --> 05:42:26,040
Zip is teleport.

6377
05:42:26,040 --> 05:42:27,040
I don't have the item.

6378
05:42:30,029 --> 05:42:32,529
I mean, I could just literally burn it down like we do

6379
05:42:32,529 --> 05:42:37,750
every fucking door in the game could blow it down, but

6380
05:42:37,750 --> 05:42:38,650
I don't have wind.

6381
05:42:40,130 --> 05:42:41,330
We could try to open it with Dopp.

6382
05:42:41,729 --> 05:42:42,729
Dopp might just work.

6383
05:42:42,729 --> 05:42:43,630
It's one stamina.

6384
05:42:43,729 --> 05:42:44,330
Let's try Dopp.

6385
05:42:47,630 --> 05:42:50,330
Cast a spell on the door swings open smoothly to reveal

6386
05:42:50,330 --> 05:42:50,830
a hallway.

6387
05:42:51,430 --> 05:42:53,430
Be decked in finery and well-kept.

6388
05:42:54,630 --> 05:42:57,330
This is the house of a nobleman, perhaps even a noble.

6389
05:42:59,279 --> 05:43:05,500
Okay inside the house.

6390
05:43:07,080 --> 05:43:09,279
Yeah, sometimes the easiest answer is the right one,

6391
05:43:09,279 --> 05:43:09,580
right?

6392
05:43:10,990 --> 05:43:12,689
The inside of the house is well-kept and clean.

6393
05:43:13,090 --> 05:43:15,889
There are fresh flowers and vases and the surfaces are

6394
05:43:15,889 --> 05:43:16,689
dust free.

6395
05:43:17,430 --> 05:43:19,830
It is as though whoever lived here has just slipped out

6396
05:43:19,830 --> 05:43:23,330
for a few minutes and will return at any moment except

6397
05:43:23,330 --> 05:43:26,229
for the paper strewn everywhere across the hallway.

6398
05:43:27,110 --> 05:43:29,509
The floor is almost a foot deep in books torn pages and

6399
05:43:29,509 --> 05:43:30,810
folders with charred edges.

6400
05:43:31,209 --> 05:43:34,409
It is as though a lightning storm has passed through the

6401
05:43:34,409 --> 05:43:35,310
study on the left.

6402
05:43:35,880 --> 05:43:38,380
Under the door lies opposite by the smell of it.

6403
05:43:38,880 --> 05:43:39,479
It's a kitchen.

6404
05:43:42,080 --> 05:43:43,380
You browse through the papers.

6405
05:43:43,479 --> 05:43:45,880
Some are complex and you cannot understand the words.

6406
05:43:46,380 --> 05:43:47,680
Others are calculations.

6407
05:43:48,180 --> 05:43:51,680
There are also maps and charts and plans of Kaare, the

6408
05:43:51,680 --> 05:43:54,180
hills and the backlands to the north.

6409
05:43:54,779 --> 05:43:57,380
Other documents look almost like charts for spellmaking

6410
05:43:57,380 --> 05:44:00,979
such as the chief mage used back in the outpost settlement

6411
05:44:00,979 --> 05:44:02,080
to prepare for your spellbook.

6412
05:44:02,779 --> 05:44:04,979
Whoever lived here was clearly a scholar of some great

6413
05:44:04,979 --> 05:44:07,580
wisdom and most likely a wizard as well.

6414
05:44:08,319 --> 05:44:10,520
Exploring doesn't seem like a good idea somehow.

6415
05:44:15,669 --> 05:44:17,970
Try the kitchen, try the study or leave.

6416
05:44:23,040 --> 05:44:24,540
You're going to die.

6417
05:44:25,380 --> 05:44:26,779
Chieftain of the Badlands.

6418
05:44:29,799 --> 05:44:31,299
Explore anyway, gigachad.

6419
05:44:31,799 --> 05:44:32,599
All right, let's go to the kitchen.

6420
05:44:35,869 --> 05:44:37,770
You open the door to the kitchen and go inside.

6421
05:44:38,250 --> 05:44:40,450
It is laid out as though the owner of the house was in

6422
05:44:40,450 --> 05:44:41,750
the middle of preparing a meal.

6423
05:44:42,349 --> 05:44:44,950
Bread is sliced, cheese is on a plate, and a glass of

6424
05:44:44,950 --> 05:44:46,950
wine sits beside the open bottle.

6425
05:44:47,619 --> 05:44:49,419
Nothing here has had time to go moldy.

6426
05:44:50,130 --> 05:44:51,729
Something is rattling in one of the cupboards.

6427
05:44:54,340 --> 05:44:55,340
I'm going to eat some of this shit.

6428
05:44:57,130 --> 05:45:00,130
You eat the bread and drink the wine and finish off with

6429
05:45:00,130 --> 05:45:02,330
the cheese, which is full flavored and ripe.

6430
05:45:03,000 --> 05:45:05,000
There is enough left over for you to add one more

6431
05:45:05,000 --> 05:45:06,500
portion to your pack as well.

6432
05:45:06,599 --> 05:45:07,500
This is Goldilocks.

6433
05:45:07,500 --> 05:45:09,200
Yeah, let's open the cupboard.

6434
05:45:10,319 --> 05:45:12,220
You open the cupboard out of curiosity.

6435
05:45:12,720 --> 05:45:16,020
And they're immediately bowled over as a thing erupts

6436
05:45:16,020 --> 05:45:17,020
with angry force.

6437
05:45:17,619 --> 05:45:19,619
You crawl backwards into the hallway to get away from

6438
05:45:19,619 --> 05:45:22,220
this gnashing fangs and get to your feet to see what

6439
05:45:22,220 --> 05:45:22,619
it is.

6440
05:45:23,020 --> 05:45:25,119
A bristle beast and it's furious.

6441
05:45:26,369 --> 05:45:28,369
No, opening the cupboards into these, they're always

6442
05:45:28,369 --> 05:45:29,069
such a bad idea.

6443
05:45:37,419 --> 05:45:42,680
I mean goblin, sap, hot might burn the house down.

6444
05:45:46,250 --> 05:45:47,150
Okay, but here's the thing.

6445
05:45:47,950 --> 05:45:49,650
Am I running out of goblin teeth?

6446
05:45:49,750 --> 05:45:50,849
We're using it so much.

6447
05:45:54,959 --> 05:45:55,360
Eight.

6448
05:45:56,060 --> 05:46:04,069
It's a lot, but let's kill it.

6449
05:46:07,180 --> 05:46:08,180
Yeah, let's just kill it.

6450
05:46:11,479 --> 05:46:12,979
You have just enough time to draw your sword.

6451
05:46:12,979 --> 05:46:13,680
Let's kill it.

6452
05:46:15,060 --> 05:46:15,759
Eight is a lot.

6453
05:46:15,759 --> 05:46:21,299
I know, but I let's go with a 6.0.

6454
05:46:23,470 --> 05:46:23,770
Dang.

6455
05:46:23,770 --> 05:46:24,069
All right.

6456
05:46:24,069 --> 05:46:24,369
Good.

6457
05:46:25,369 --> 05:46:26,970
The bristle beast bears its teeth.

6458
05:46:27,470 --> 05:46:29,569
Beast lashes out with its claws, but it cannot defend

6459
05:46:29,569 --> 05:46:30,569
itself from your force.

6460
05:46:30,569 --> 05:46:31,169
Do it again.

6461
05:46:33,930 --> 05:46:34,229
All right.

6462
05:46:34,229 --> 05:46:35,830
Now we get a free kill essentially.

6463
05:46:36,130 --> 05:46:36,930
No stamina lost.

6464
05:46:36,930 --> 05:46:37,330
We're good.

6465
05:46:41,659 --> 05:46:44,159
It twists on the metal then curls up like an overheated

6466
05:46:44,159 --> 05:46:49,580
beetle and dies, but the creature dead you pause to

6467
05:46:49,580 --> 05:46:50,279
catch your breath.

6468
05:46:50,279 --> 05:46:50,880
Where now?

6469
05:46:53,000 --> 05:46:53,299
Study.

6470
05:46:56,279 --> 05:46:56,580
Pet?

6471
05:46:59,560 --> 05:47:01,459
You open the door to the study pushing hard against a

6472
05:47:01,459 --> 05:47:03,060
deeper pile of paper.

6473
05:47:03,930 --> 05:47:06,330
This room looks like a tornado has traveled through it

6474
05:47:06,330 --> 05:47:07,529
and perhaps one has.

6475
05:47:08,130 --> 05:47:10,630
In the very center of the room is a blackened circle

6476
05:47:10,630 --> 05:47:11,729
burnt into the carpet.

6477
05:47:12,430 --> 05:47:14,930
There's a smell of iron and ammonia in the air.

6478
05:47:15,529 --> 05:47:17,430
It is hard to escape the sense that some great and

6479
05:47:17,430 --> 05:47:20,959
terrible magic was performed here not long ago, but

6480
05:47:20,959 --> 05:47:22,759
there's no sign of the magician who crafted such a

6481
05:47:22,759 --> 05:47:23,560
powerful spell.

6482
05:47:27,529 --> 05:47:32,529
On all fours you dig through the piles of paper books torn

6483
05:47:32,529 --> 05:47:35,830
up, almanacs, historical files and sheets of scrawl and

6484
05:47:35,830 --> 05:47:36,330
scribble.

6485
05:47:36,869 --> 05:47:38,470
There's nothing here with any meaning.

6486
05:47:39,400 --> 05:47:42,099
On one sheet you find an intriguing series of symbols.

6487
05:47:43,130 --> 05:47:48,860
N, Q, then a series of other marks written and then crossed

6488
05:47:48,860 --> 05:47:49,060
out.

6489
05:47:49,729 --> 05:47:51,930
Only one is still readable and it has been circled.

6490
05:47:52,830 --> 05:47:53,229
T.

6491
05:47:55,790 --> 05:47:59,409
Okay, keep searching.

6492
05:48:00,599 --> 05:48:02,500
You keep rustling through the paper finding little

6493
05:48:02,500 --> 05:48:06,599
doubts of value then underneath a heap of tomes about

6494
05:48:06,599 --> 05:48:09,599
the early founders of the city with several passages

6495
05:48:09,599 --> 05:48:13,099
underlined and marked with comments you cannot read.

6496
05:48:13,799 --> 05:48:17,500
You unearth a green-haired wig which you put into your

6497
05:48:17,500 --> 05:48:17,900
pack.

6498
05:48:18,500 --> 05:48:20,299
We can finally talk to fucking animals.

6499
05:48:21,360 --> 05:48:22,159
You return to the hallway.

6500
05:48:23,220 --> 05:48:24,919
You explored enough you leave the house and return to

6501
05:48:24,919 --> 05:48:25,720
the street outside.

6502
05:48:27,319 --> 05:48:32,099
Finally we can talk to the horse baldness cured.

6503
05:48:32,700 --> 05:48:33,599
Oh, yeah, that's right.

6504
05:48:36,880 --> 05:48:37,880
You return to the main road.

6505
05:48:40,020 --> 05:48:40,619
Follow the road.

6506
05:48:44,180 --> 05:48:46,580
The road continues on between dense houses on either side

6507
05:48:46,580 --> 05:48:50,580
when suddenly begin to smell a sharp acrid smell burning

6508
05:48:51,220 --> 05:48:51,819
looking up ahead.

6509
05:48:51,819 --> 05:48:54,819
Do you see a column of smoke is the district on fire?

6510
05:48:56,770 --> 05:48:57,369
I'll handle this.

6511
05:49:06,709 --> 05:49:07,209
Sus.

6512
05:49:08,880 --> 05:49:16,919
Where's water fog some in darkness magic protection?

6513
05:49:20,479 --> 05:49:20,680
Fuck.

6514
05:49:20,680 --> 05:49:21,479
I don't know what that is.

6515
05:49:29,139 --> 05:49:33,060
Maybe I'll put on a force field or magic.

6516
05:49:33,060 --> 05:49:34,659
Wait, is fire technically magic?

6517
05:49:41,319 --> 05:49:41,919
Not really.

6518
05:49:46,500 --> 05:49:47,900
Would darkness put the fire out?

6519
05:49:51,360 --> 05:49:52,360
It's just fire.

6520
05:49:56,849 --> 05:49:57,950
Make it worse hot.

6521
05:50:02,599 --> 05:50:03,299
You sus.

6522
05:50:11,860 --> 05:50:15,060
You cast the spell in a calm voice enters your mind telling

6523
05:50:15,060 --> 05:50:16,159
you not to fear.

6524
05:50:16,659 --> 05:50:17,959
There's no danger up ahead.

6525
05:50:18,860 --> 05:50:20,459
You're reassured in the spell fades.

6526
05:50:22,659 --> 05:50:27,060
Okay, feeling safe with the warming warning from your

6527
05:50:27,060 --> 05:50:31,139
spell you stride forward towards the smoke rounding a

6528
05:50:31,139 --> 05:50:33,340
corner in the road until you see the source.

6529
05:50:33,340 --> 05:50:36,240
It is a fire but not a blazing house instead.

6530
05:50:36,740 --> 05:50:39,540
It comes from an enormous Forge set into a large

6531
05:50:39,540 --> 05:50:40,740
blacksmith shop.

6532
05:50:41,669 --> 05:50:44,770
The blacksmith himself is at work hammering away at a

6533
05:50:44,770 --> 05:50:46,069
flat bladed sword.

6534
05:50:48,090 --> 05:50:48,990
Oh, okay.

6535
05:50:50,819 --> 05:50:52,419
Almost created a force field for that.

6536
05:50:52,419 --> 05:50:52,720
Yeah.

6537
05:50:54,250 --> 05:50:55,950
You approach the blacksmith and try to attract his

6538
05:50:55,950 --> 05:50:58,450
attention by knocking a few of his display items off

6539
05:50:58,450 --> 05:50:59,049
their shelves.

6540
05:50:59,049 --> 05:51:01,750
What an asshole, but it seems the blacksmith is quite

6541
05:51:01,750 --> 05:51:05,310
deaf years of hammering on sparking metal has left him

6542
05:51:05,310 --> 05:51:06,810
quite oblivious to everything around him.

6543
05:51:07,990 --> 05:51:08,990
Steal something.

6544
05:51:09,630 --> 05:51:10,430
Why would I do that?

6545
05:51:10,930 --> 05:51:11,529
Is this a Mr.

6546
05:51:11,529 --> 05:51:12,729
Bean movie?

6547
05:51:14,209 --> 05:51:15,110
What would the point of that be?

6548
05:51:18,369 --> 05:51:20,270
Let's let's tap his arm.

6549
05:51:21,299 --> 05:51:24,599
You walk over and tap his arm the blacksmith jumps.

6550
05:51:27,270 --> 05:51:28,470
I didn't see you here.

6551
05:51:30,590 --> 05:51:32,090
Man is clearly not that bright.

6552
05:51:35,040 --> 05:51:40,430
I didn't mean to scare you not scared of me of you.

6553
05:51:40,830 --> 05:51:45,250
Nah, the blacksmith polishes his blade lovingly.

6554
05:51:48,770 --> 05:51:49,770
Tell me about your swords.

6555
05:51:51,500 --> 05:51:53,599
This one is my hardest.

6556
05:51:54,200 --> 05:51:56,099
He replies proudly indicating the blade.

6557
05:51:56,099 --> 05:52:00,540
He is currently polishing up a blade of a large hand.

6558
05:52:01,889 --> 05:52:08,409
I try it large hand large hand is large handry.

6559
05:52:09,459 --> 05:52:13,779
What try the blade you reach out to try the blade,

6560
05:52:13,779 --> 05:52:15,279
but the blacksmith catches your arm.

6561
05:52:16,250 --> 05:52:19,229
I warn you once you're tried it.

6562
05:52:19,529 --> 05:52:22,930
You won't want any other and it's not a cheap lard.

6563
05:52:26,349 --> 05:52:26,950
I'll risk it.

6564
05:52:28,069 --> 05:52:30,970
The last Smith shrugs and releases your arm.

6565
05:52:32,290 --> 05:52:32,990
They're on them.

6566
05:52:34,520 --> 05:52:36,419
You pick up the blade and swing it through the air.

6567
05:52:36,419 --> 05:52:38,919
It sings the weight is perfect.

6568
05:52:39,020 --> 05:52:41,119
The metal sharpened the balance so delicate.

6569
05:52:41,220 --> 05:52:43,119
It becomes almost an extension of your arm.

6570
05:52:43,119 --> 05:52:50,360
This is the finest blade you have ever held how much the

6571
05:52:50,360 --> 05:52:51,560
blacksmith grins.

6572
05:52:52,400 --> 05:53:01,279
I tell you ready for it fighting old pieces party blacksmith

6573
05:53:01,279 --> 05:53:01,880
nods.

6574
05:53:02,479 --> 05:53:04,380
That's right party.

6575
05:53:06,169 --> 05:53:12,540
Uh Haggle, I'll give you half that you begin but the blacksmith

6576
05:53:12,540 --> 05:53:20,680
only laughs are talking to your child party or solid to the

6577
05:53:20,680 --> 05:53:21,380
next one.

6578
05:53:24,599 --> 05:53:25,299
That's too much.

6579
05:53:25,299 --> 05:53:26,200
I don't have that much.

6580
05:53:30,659 --> 05:53:34,520
I don't have that much blacksmith nods and takes the

6581
05:53:34,520 --> 05:53:35,919
blade back with loving care.

6582
05:53:36,849 --> 05:53:39,250
I'll find each owner sooner enough.

6583
05:53:39,250 --> 05:53:46,119
I'm sure fuck fuck fuck shit shoot shit 40 gold though.

6584
05:53:46,119 --> 05:53:46,819
Holy crap.

6585
05:53:46,819 --> 05:53:47,520
How would you have?

6586
05:53:47,520 --> 05:53:48,720
You might you have to save everything.

6587
05:53:52,020 --> 05:53:57,270
Um, do you make wolf armor you ask thinking about the

6588
05:53:57,270 --> 05:54:01,509
strange werewolf you saw blacksmith looks at you with

6589
05:54:01,509 --> 05:54:05,400
fierce cold eyes Vic for first noble.

6590
05:54:06,369 --> 05:54:08,169
He replies but says nothing more.

6591
05:54:09,650 --> 05:54:10,450
Who's Vic?

6592
05:54:11,979 --> 05:54:15,290
He's the boss has been for a long time.

6593
05:54:15,990 --> 05:54:19,840
Just make it an official blacksmith quickly hammers

6594
05:54:19,840 --> 05:54:20,340
something.

6595
05:54:20,340 --> 05:54:21,840
The noise makes your head spin.

6596
05:54:24,169 --> 05:54:25,770
I'm interested in the North Gate spell.

6597
05:54:27,840 --> 05:54:31,279
I make sards not magic.

6598
05:54:31,849 --> 05:54:33,250
You want a side baby?

6599
05:54:34,209 --> 05:54:37,250
The blacksmith goes over to the rack in the back of his

6600
05:54:37,250 --> 05:54:39,450
shop and downs a quick mug of ale.

6601
05:54:40,349 --> 05:54:45,840
I'd best do your work be guard and begins to hammer so

6602
05:54:45,840 --> 05:54:46,240
loudly.

6603
05:54:46,240 --> 05:54:48,540
You fear for your hearing you cook you run you run to

6604
05:54:48,540 --> 05:54:49,540
the god damn it.

6605
05:54:49,540 --> 05:54:50,639
I wanted that fucking sword.

6606
05:54:53,770 --> 05:54:56,369
I wanted the sword 40 gold though.

6607
05:54:56,369 --> 05:54:58,900
Come on shard.

6608
05:55:03,630 --> 05:55:05,130
We will allow you to rewind.

6609
05:55:06,159 --> 05:55:10,389
I don't have the money you walk between the narrow

6610
05:55:10,389 --> 05:55:13,029
buildings until you reach a fork to the left the road

6611
05:55:13,029 --> 05:55:15,970
continues towards some kind of bustling market while

6612
05:55:15,970 --> 05:55:18,400
to the right it leads down a shorter Street in the

6613
05:55:18,400 --> 05:55:21,700
center of the fork is a great bronze statue with some

6614
05:55:21,700 --> 05:55:23,099
kind of pot at its feet.

6615
05:55:28,400 --> 05:55:34,259
Interesting down the short Street looking down the

6616
05:55:34,259 --> 05:55:35,060
short Street to the right.

6617
05:55:35,060 --> 05:55:38,659
You see a sign above a door reading the gambling halls

6618
05:55:38,659 --> 05:55:42,159
of Vlada several seedy looking creatures mill about

6619
05:55:42,159 --> 05:55:45,799
on the steps cheerful creatures go in and miserable

6620
05:55:45,799 --> 05:55:51,889
looking ones come out the statue the statue is of a

6621
05:55:51,889 --> 05:55:56,150
giant brute wielding a club and at its feet is a large

6622
05:55:56,150 --> 05:55:57,549
pot filled with gold pieces.

6623
05:55:58,419 --> 05:56:01,389
This must be one of car as many gods with the pot

6624
05:56:01,389 --> 05:56:03,290
intended for worshippers making offerings.

6625
05:56:03,889 --> 05:56:05,689
Although none of the passing creatures seem to be

6626
05:56:05,689 --> 05:56:11,979
throwing any in interesting make a move time to move

6627
05:56:13,270 --> 05:56:22,369
whoa through the arch the statue the left fork.

6628
05:56:22,470 --> 05:56:23,669
I mean there's a lot here.

6629
05:56:25,549 --> 05:56:30,840
I want to check out the statue you go over to the

6630
05:56:30,840 --> 05:56:33,139
statue and look into the pot seems to contain almost

6631
05:56:33,139 --> 05:56:34,540
20 gold pieces.

6632
05:56:39,529 --> 05:56:43,720
Look at the statue tilting your head you look upwards

6633
05:56:43,720 --> 05:56:44,319
at the statue.

6634
05:56:44,319 --> 05:56:47,319
He is an imposing figure at least four times your

6635
05:56:47,319 --> 05:56:48,720
height and solidly armed.

6636
05:56:49,619 --> 05:56:52,720
You do not recognize the God depicted but his presence

6637
05:56:52,720 --> 05:56:56,020
so close to the gambling halls suggest he's either

6638
05:56:56,020 --> 05:56:59,189
God of prosperity or God devoted to punishing those

6639
05:56:59,189 --> 05:57:00,689
who do not pay their debts.

6640
05:57:02,680 --> 05:57:06,759
I ain't taking this shit seems most suspicious so

6641
05:57:06,759 --> 05:57:07,759
much gold out in the open.

6642
05:57:07,759 --> 05:57:08,659
It must be a trap.

6643
05:57:08,959 --> 05:57:09,560
The day is dry.

6644
05:57:09,560 --> 05:57:10,360
I'm not touching that.

6645
05:57:12,790 --> 05:57:16,900
That's a bad idea bad idea.

6646
05:57:20,560 --> 05:57:27,509
And with that ladies and gentlemen, we're going to

6647
05:57:27,509 --> 05:57:28,110
call it a day.

6648
05:57:35,369 --> 05:57:41,340
That's it much more to explore in Kari.

6649
05:57:48,419 --> 05:57:50,020
I think that six hours is good.

6650
05:57:50,919 --> 05:57:53,020
My voice is getting a little shot.

6651
05:57:54,599 --> 05:57:58,659
I also still have sort of a lingering cough and

6652
05:57:58,659 --> 05:57:59,259
congestion.

6653
05:57:59,259 --> 05:58:05,259
I don't want to overdo it but you will see this return

6654
05:58:05,259 --> 05:58:06,959
where at least going to get through Kari.

6655
05:58:08,439 --> 05:58:11,139
So here's the question that I have to ask.

6656
05:58:11,139 --> 05:58:12,740
I'm going to put the question here.

6657
05:58:15,650 --> 05:58:22,560
Let's see how I'm going to ask the mod something

6658
05:58:22,560 --> 05:58:24,060
really quick because I want to see if we're going

6659
05:58:24,060 --> 05:58:28,459
to be doing the like God and train going by my head.

6660
05:58:32,549 --> 05:58:32,950
Okay.

6661
05:58:33,049 --> 05:58:36,049
How are we on the videos?

6662
05:58:36,909 --> 05:58:39,409
Do we need any more time?

6663
05:58:42,220 --> 05:58:42,819
How are we doing?

6664
05:58:43,020 --> 05:58:47,500
We need some more time dork.

6665
05:58:47,500 --> 05:58:48,299
You need to look up.

6666
05:58:48,400 --> 05:58:52,520
Oh, oh whoops.

6667
05:58:54,099 --> 05:58:59,080
All right guys tomorrow night tomorrow evening

6668
05:59:01,229 --> 05:59:06,900
green screen movie night is tomorrow Sunday evening,

6669
05:59:12,299 --> 05:59:13,400
but we'll see you tomorrow.

6670
05:59:15,259 --> 05:59:16,659
The time we will be starting.

6671
05:59:16,659 --> 05:59:18,060
I want to do it in the evening hours.

6672
05:59:19,119 --> 05:59:22,020
So we're going to start probably around not too too

6673
05:59:22,020 --> 05:59:24,840
late maybe four o'clock Pacific.

6674
05:59:25,720 --> 05:59:27,119
I think that's a good I don't want to do it at like

6675
05:59:27,119 --> 05:59:28,020
seven eight nine ten or anything.

6676
05:59:28,020 --> 05:59:28,720
We'll start at four.

6677
05:59:31,900 --> 05:59:35,229
I am going to try to make sure this internet doesn't

6678
05:59:35,229 --> 05:59:38,000
have a problem and I will tell you right now.

6679
05:59:39,159 --> 05:59:40,459
This is very very important.

6680
05:59:41,479 --> 05:59:42,880
It's planned for tomorrow.

6681
05:59:43,799 --> 05:59:47,959
But if if we have a bunch of drop frames, I don't

6682
05:59:47,959 --> 05:59:49,759
want to ruin that stream with drop frames because

6683
05:59:49,759 --> 05:59:50,759
this one is fine.

6684
05:59:51,259 --> 05:59:54,259
If I have an ingest twitch server problem with this

6685
05:59:54,259 --> 05:59:56,459
game, it's literally it's a you were reading.

6686
05:59:57,439 --> 06:00:02,049
So if if I have to move it I'm going to so just be

6687
06:00:02,049 --> 06:00:05,150
aware that it's planned for tomorrow at four, but

6688
06:00:05,150 --> 06:00:06,950
I don't want to get that stream fucked up or ruined

6689
06:00:06,950 --> 06:00:08,650
by shitty internet problems.

6690
06:00:10,049 --> 06:00:11,650
So let me just make sure that we're going to be

6691
06:00:11,650 --> 06:00:14,080
okay before we actually do that stream.

6692
06:00:18,209 --> 06:00:21,459
So yeah, we'll start at four tomorrow.

6693
06:00:21,860 --> 06:00:23,959
If not, if I'm like, I'm not confident.

6694
06:00:23,959 --> 06:00:25,860
I want to see if I can get this spell fixed or

6695
06:00:25,860 --> 06:00:28,930
solved before the next stream and we will do it on

6696
06:00:28,930 --> 06:00:33,770
probably maybe Monday or Monday or Tuesday, maybe

6697
06:00:33,770 --> 06:00:37,020
Monday or we'll hold it to the next weekend.

6698
06:00:37,020 --> 06:00:38,220
I'm not in a rush, right?

6699
06:00:42,729 --> 06:00:47,680
I'm not in a rush or p.m.

6700
06:00:47,680 --> 06:00:48,180
Pacific.

6701
06:00:51,919 --> 06:00:52,919
Yeah, that's sorcery.

6702
06:00:52,919 --> 06:00:53,919
I hope you guys enjoy it.

6703
06:00:54,020 --> 06:00:57,279
I if you guys have been having fun cherish it

6704
06:00:57,279 --> 06:01:00,790
because this is and when I say cherish it, I mean

6705
06:01:00,790 --> 06:01:03,750
really do because when it's over, I'm not going

6706
06:01:03,750 --> 06:01:05,349
to be playing this ever again on stream.

6707
06:01:07,279 --> 06:01:08,380
I'm cherishing it right now.

6708
06:01:10,049 --> 06:01:12,849
If you think that this is a big game and there's a

6709
06:01:12,849 --> 06:01:14,650
lot to do which obviously we didn't do a ton of

6710
06:01:14,650 --> 06:01:17,540
stuff over here and there's things that you'll see

6711
06:01:17,540 --> 06:01:17,939
later.

6712
06:01:18,840 --> 06:01:22,139
This is part two part three is potentially even a

6713
06:01:22,139 --> 06:01:25,580
little bit bigger than this is more to it.

6714
06:01:25,580 --> 06:01:25,979
Essentially.

6715
06:01:25,979 --> 06:01:28,580
This is a huge game part three is a whole nother

6716
06:01:28,580 --> 06:01:29,080
map.

6717
06:01:29,279 --> 06:01:32,840
That's about maybe one and a half times the size part

6718
06:01:32,840 --> 06:01:37,500
four is probably the size of car and look if I

6719
06:01:37,500 --> 06:01:41,619
don't play through part three, maybe you'll get it

6720
06:01:41,720 --> 06:01:45,119
and jump in and have fun with it because seriously

6721
06:01:45,119 --> 06:01:48,020
it's one of the best it's just fun to fuck around

6722
06:01:48,020 --> 06:01:50,220
and all the spells do different things.

6723
06:01:50,799 --> 06:01:51,700
There's so many different routes.

6724
06:01:51,700 --> 06:01:53,400
You can take so many items to collect.

6725
06:01:53,939 --> 06:01:54,740
It's just a fun time.

6726
06:01:54,740 --> 06:01:56,639
It just really is genuinely a fun experience.

6727
06:01:59,360 --> 06:02:01,159
But yeah, we'll see what we're going to at least

6728
06:02:01,159 --> 06:02:03,259
at the very least complete car and see how people

6729
06:02:03,259 --> 06:02:03,560
feel.

6730
06:02:04,740 --> 06:02:05,939
Why wouldn't you play three and four?

6731
06:02:06,900 --> 06:02:10,000
There's no reason not to but obviously I don't want

6732
06:02:10,000 --> 06:02:13,080
people to get bored of it, which it doesn't seem

6733
06:02:13,080 --> 06:02:13,979
like that's happened so far.

6734
06:02:13,979 --> 06:02:14,580
So let's go.

6735
06:02:19,700 --> 06:02:20,099
All right.

6736
06:02:20,099 --> 06:02:23,900
I'll see you guys tomorrow tentatively keep an eye

6737
06:02:23,900 --> 06:02:26,799
on the sus when I get up tomorrow morning.

6738
06:02:26,799 --> 06:02:29,919
I'm going to do some more tests and you will buy

6739
06:02:29,919 --> 06:02:32,619
buy like one or two o'clock in the afternoon Pacific

6740
06:02:32,619 --> 06:02:33,020
tomorrow.

6741
06:02:33,020 --> 06:02:34,919
You will know if we're going to move the green

6742
06:02:34,919 --> 06:02:35,720
screen stream or not.

6743
06:02:37,639 --> 06:02:38,040
All right guys.

6744
06:02:38,040 --> 06:02:38,439
See you later.

6745
06:02:41,099 --> 06:02:41,700
Thank you again.

6746
06:02:43,040 --> 06:02:44,740
I got to figure out why this keeps happening.

6747
06:02:44,840 --> 06:02:45,840
I'm going to talk to twitch about it.

6748
06:02:45,840 --> 06:02:48,439
I think and just be like, hey, how come my internet

6749
06:02:48,439 --> 06:02:49,240
is perfectly fine?

6750
06:02:49,240 --> 06:02:54,319
But sometimes I maybe once every week or two I have

6751
06:02:54,319 --> 06:02:55,020
to like jump.

6752
06:02:55,119 --> 06:02:57,490
I have to server hop to find the right one.

6753
06:02:57,490 --> 06:02:59,490
That's not going to drop like 10,000 frames over

6754
06:02:59,490 --> 06:03:04,759
the course of an evening because this is a new

6755
06:03:04,759 --> 06:03:04,959
thing.

6756
06:03:04,959 --> 06:03:09,119
This keeps happening and it's weird because I will

6757
06:03:09,119 --> 06:03:11,819
run speed test and I will run a whole dedicated

6758
06:03:12,430 --> 06:03:17,270
test stream to these exact same servers and still

6759
06:03:17,270 --> 06:03:17,970
run into problems.

6760
06:03:18,169 --> 06:03:18,669
It's weird.

6761
06:03:22,709 --> 06:03:23,610
It's weird.

6762
06:03:26,709 --> 06:03:27,610
It's not it's not a net.

6763
06:03:27,610 --> 06:03:29,009
I don't think it's a network card problem or a

6764
06:03:29,009 --> 06:03:33,110
network problem considering I had a broadcast on

6765
06:03:33,110 --> 06:03:35,709
OBS to these same servers on Twitch.

6766
06:03:37,439 --> 06:03:37,939
I don't get it.

6767
06:03:39,599 --> 06:03:42,740
I might try what I'm going to try to stream to an

6768
06:03:42,740 --> 06:03:44,439
East Coast server and see how it happens.

6769
