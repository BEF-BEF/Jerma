1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:10,410
Hello, hello, hello. Hi. Yes, we're here. Well, that was what we'd like to call an adventure.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:24,780
So for those of you that don't know, I had a plan today. I was thinking of starting the ace attorney.

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,300
See, no, I'm not gonna wait. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait because there are people probably

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,659
coming in. Remember, we're watching the Super Bowl. So am I. There's a long list of what's

5
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:45,740
going on today. First of all, free nothing. Patriots just scored. I don't have a TV.

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,380
I don't have cable that can watch this game and I'm not watching it right now a lot.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:07,459
I'm getting the like website updates on what happened. That's bad. I forgot today was the

8
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:16,299
Super Bowl. Okay. I had, I did not know this last night, late last night when we were like,

9
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,430
oh yeah, tomorrow we're gonna do ace attorney. That sounds like a good idea. Let's do ace

10
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:28,569
attorney tomorrow during the Super Bowl. I was like, ah, I woke up this morning and two things

11
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,730
happened. First thing that happened is the Super Bowl is today. Do you know how I knew that?

12
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,099
Because my entire family sent me messages telling me how excited they are. And I was

13
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,939
like, what are they excited for? It was like, I have like 40 messages from my family

14
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,620
and they all, they're all dressed in Patriots. This is all the Super Bowl is today.

15
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:57,189
I forgot. And so the plan was gonna play ace attorney, but you know, that's just the way it

16
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:03,640
is. Ace attorney, Phoenix Wright. And that didn't turn out the way that I wanted to for two

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,120
reasons. One, yes, Super Bowl. And I wanted to pay attention to it because the Patriots

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,090
are in it. That's my team. You know, until the Raiders get here, that's my team. Problem

19
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:23,370
two, uh, ace attorney. I have, I bought them all on the iPad. So iPad comes in sick. There's my iPad

20
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,810
got a crack in it, but it still works. My splitter. Okay. Yeah. I packed that one. Remember

21
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,860
I packed that one. I don't have the audio splitter, so I couldn't capture the audio

22
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,460
from my iPad. Somehow it got lost in the move, got lost in the mail. Thought about potentially

23
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,750
emulating like, all right, I bought them all. I have them all on iPad. Let's whatever. Like

24
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,389
this idea came out last night, right? Like ace attorney. I didn't really plan that much on it.

25
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,110
It was like last night I bought them and like, I'm going to try it this morning and

26
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:07,939
you see how it went. Um, the emulators, they're, they're all removed from the internet,

27
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:11,379
at least on a couple of the places that I thought. Cause you know, I all, I own the

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:20,360
titles maybe out of desperation. I've bought them, I own them. And then I heard that there's

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,699
going to be a PC remaster of ace attorney coming out very soon. So I'm sitting here going,

30
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:38,620
Oh God damn it. What the fuck? When are those coming out? So what I've decided to do today

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,659
is I still own ace attorney and I can still get it to work. And so we have to get a

32
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:48,439
new audio splitter. Here's an emulation. I don't want to talk about emulators,

33
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:56,740
no emulation. Not yet. I'm not talking about that yet. So what I've decided to do is because

34
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,069
Super Bowls today, I went through, I jumped through a bunch of hoops and I was able to

35
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:13,210
get this. Well, hold on. There's like a logo on here. I don't want, I don't want like a,

36
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:19,819
hold on. There's like a, I don't want to show this thing. Oh, give me a second.

37
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:35,060
It's like two logos on here. All right. Well, you know what? We'll just show the back.

38
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,019
No, I was going to go like this. So this is what I was able to get today. Like let's rewind.

39
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay. So after all, I was going to play a ace attorney and I jumped through a bunch of hoops

40
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:57,209
and I was able to get this. I just blitzed the league too. One of my favorite games of

41
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:02,730
all time on the old generation console. So you're probably asking yourself, I mean it is,

42
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,129
it is Patriots Day, right? It is like the Patriots are like gone. So I made sure to get

43
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:13,689
my Patriots clothes on today. Hey, can you tell? I knew it was a fucking goddamn Superbowl.

44
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:38,470
10% of my wardrobe guys. Do you understand? Go Patriots. It's desynced, which shouldn't be.

45
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:52,279
What? You're going to desync me? Oh, it is desync. What a piece of crap. Hold on. But

46
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,279
yeah, uh, blitz the league too. It even blitz the league. If you guys didn't know,

47
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,610
this is where Mortal Kombat got their horrible, break the person's neck closeup blood comes out

48
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,790
of their mouth animations. This is not a regular football game by a long shot.

49
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:19,459
This is the game where all those crazy brutal things that happen in Mortal Kombat,

50
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:25,620
this is where they came from. Same company. This game is fucking hilarious. It's amazing.

51
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,100
And I got it today. I got this today. I activated Jax powers and I got, well, I had some help,

52
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:40,709
but you know. How do I put this in? I don't believe you. Is it Mortal Kombat older?

53
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,589
Mortal Kombat's zoom in. You'll see what I'm talking about. Once I like punch a guy in the

54
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:52,629
nuts and like his balls explode, like that, I'm not, I'm just saying that that happens in

55
00:06:52,629 --> 00:07:02,759
this game because it does. You'll understand. How do I, I'm not used to this PlayStation.

56
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:11,420
This is all very quick. We got this set up immediately. Who scored? Nobody. It's still

57
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,540
three down. I don't know how to put the disc inside of this PlayStation. I'm not kidding.

58
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:26,490
This is bad. How do I open this? Does this have discs? Anybody know how to do this?

59
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:47,750
Where do I put the disc in? It's on the left. Just push it in. It's not on the left.

60
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,129
Wait a minute. Hold on. Somebody help me. Hold on. I gotta move some stuff.

61
00:07:53,129 --> 00:08:12,790
Is there a disc in there? No, there's no disc in there already. For a second, I thought

62
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,240
stupid invaders was in here. Where's the, wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Okay. No, I got it.

63
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:34,389
No. All right. I'm turning the fucking webcam on. You guys have to help me here.

64
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:50,039
I don't get it. I don't get it. You ready? How do I, how the fuck do I put a disc in

65
00:08:50,039 --> 00:09:18,309
here? Where does it go? There's nothing here. There's nothing there. Slide it. I've never

66
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:34,440
seen a PlayStation like that. I'll slide the top open. No way. Slide it open. Oh, fuck my

67
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:46,259
camera. We had to activate Jax this morning. I have a controller, right? Okay. Let's delete

68
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:56,409
two going in into the weird like Willy Wonka machine. What? I've owned like three different

69
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:07,960
PlayStation 3s. I've never seen a slide the top. Here we go. Welcome to Blitz the League.

70
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:17,019
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. Welcome to Blitz the League 2,

71
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:28,250
right? If there's something wrong with this disc, the last hour was jumping through hoops

72
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:42,600
to get this. Oh, thank God. Anybody score? Who has the ball? A mandatory game data install

73
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,580
is required for Blitz. Yeah. Please don't turn off the fucking PlayStation. Oops. Wait, what?

74
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:16,789
Oh, shit. I forgot. Where's this camera even pointing? This camera sucks. You know who's

75
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:25,610
got a real monopoly on the video camera industry? Logitech. They are, they are the

76
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:37,769
Kleenex of cameras. It's bullshit. There's like four cameras stalling. No, I got 17%. I don't

77
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,779
want you to, I don't want you guys to know what the percentage is. Just use a cam link

78
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:51,529
and a real camera. I don't want to like hook up a DSLR up here. I don't, I don't,

79
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,809
do you guys think I, what would you think? I want you to see my face in like 4k.

80
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:05,110
You think sometimes I look fucked up now. Imagine what I would look like in every

81
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,320
pore, every pocket of my face being shown. No, you're not getting the Ren and Stimpy

82
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:25,690
close-up camera on my face. I'm sorry, guys. What are we at? 31. Who has the ball? The,

83
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:32,009
I can't believe I forgot the fucking Super Bowl was today. And it was like a perfect,

84
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,809
it was a perfect opportunity. So I streamed the last two days in a row. This is three

85
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,889
days in a row, right? I was gonna, oh, maybe I'll take today off. I would have like

86
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:44,679
probably watched the Super Bowl, but I can't even watch the Super Bowl. So uneven side

87
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,600
brides. That's not true. I tried as hard as I could in the morning to shape them. See,

88
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,340
look one, two, right in the right spot. I mean, I may have ripped, I may have butchered

89
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:04,169
this side a little. They're not uneven. They're just unorganized. There's a difference.

90
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:13,379
They're actually uneven. No, they're just unorganized. They're uneven as fuck. No,

91
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,460
they're not. They are, they're just, they just don't look right because I need a haircut.

92
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,799
And when I get a haircut, they just, they take them out. Speaking of haircuts,

93
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:31,960
I need to get one of those too. They actually are uneven. I can't buy, I can't buy,

94
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:39,340
the camera's right here. You guys are right here. Video game is here. OBS preview is over

95
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,779
here right now. I can't, there's no way I can fucking do this. I'd have to go into the

96
00:13:42,779 --> 00:14:02,230
bathroom, cut your own hair. What's the percentage? 65. He shouldn't, I don't know.

97
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,659
I think it might have something, you know what I think it is? So I don't know about you

98
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:10,059
guys, but I have like, I have like an uneven face. So when I'm like turning and looking

99
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:14,059
this way, going like this, my eyes are in a different, this eye is not in the right

100
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,779
position. It's like squished in. Then my nose is like bigger on this side. So when

101
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,299
I'm like shaving over here, I'm like blocking my view. When I'm shaving over here,

102
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:32,330
I have like two different viewpoints because my face is uneven. Your face is fucked up.

103
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:54,539
Yeah? So? Your face is fucked. No one's face is completely even. Thank you Dr. Phil.

104
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:02,549
Second quarter? When is the Super Bowl halftime show? Is that free? Is it free to see,

105
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:11,269
to watch the halftime show? Don't, doesn't every TV channel all at the same time turn

106
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,639
on the halftime show? I thought that was like legally what happens. Like you're

107
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,320
in the middle of law and order or something and it's just like,

108
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,000
you're in the right stuff baby I was born. It just goes to it, right? Every network.

109
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,889
Installation complete. Please quit the game through the PS button and restart. Blitz League

110
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:44,389
2. You got it. I hope there's enough battery in this. What am I doing? Okay, quit game. Yes.

111
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,340
It's free on the CBS website, but I'll go to jail if I play that, right?

112
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,230
On stream. You can't do that on stream. That's the quickest way to go to jail.

113
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:10,519
Look at those pores. Shut up. Any score? Who has the ball? Patriots have the ball. It's

114
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:21,500
3-0. Did they get a field goal? I need play-by-play from you guys. High definition HD gaming.

115
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:30,710
Here we go. I'm so excited. This game is amazing. Touchdown? Can you get 100% of

116
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:38,820
the trophies from me? Blitz League 2. Not rated. Interaction's not rated by the ESRB.

117
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,659
So they're talking about when guys get like punched in the balls and they explode. That's

118
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:53,460
what they're talking about. They can't rate that. By the way, there's no actual NFL teams in this

119
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:03,450
game. It's like the Boston Brew House. It's like the Cincinnati Steelers. There's no actual

120
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:11,259
licensed teams. I can't wait to play this. Okay, so let's go ahead. We're probably

121
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:15,500
going to get this whole thing claimed from the... We probably need to turn that off.

122
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:26,490
Yeah, we have to turn this. We have to turn this off. I'm sorry, guys,

123
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:35,769
but the whole VOD's going to get muted. The rest of this is fine. Difficulty? Yeah,

124
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:41,529
no vibration. Get that out of here. Video? Brightness is fine. I don't remember exactly how

125
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:51,799
to play, but I know some things. We can do training camp. No, I gotta do the Super Bowl

126
00:17:51,799 --> 00:18:01,829
right now. It's going on right now. No, training camp. Receiving defense. Yeah, you

127
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:06,920
have to stick syringes in your players and stuff. All right, we're going to do

128
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,690
watch and learn how to be a pro. Rushing. It's a game of inches. Let's just... I gotta remind

129
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:23,430
my brain. You got like three hours. That shit's going to go on forever. No, dude,

130
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,150
it's already almost halftime. This stream can only be as long as the Super Bowl.

131
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,549
And then I gotta get off all my Super Bowl Patriots gear and turn the stream off.

132
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,710
It won't look right. All right, superstar, you look ready to go. This should be easy

133
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,150
enough. Just take the handoff and bang out a few yards. Press X to hike the ball,

134
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:52,500
gain 10 yards. That's a burst down. That is the way to execute. I think some people are

135
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,660
going to come to the stream and not understand. Power move. How do you do a power move?

136
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:09,980
And that's what we call a top down. This game is so good. Evade.

137
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,640
Let's see if you can juke the pros. Looking good. Don't let up now.

138
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,220
I'm so sad they didn't make a new one. It's freestyle time. So that's a freestyle.

139
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:34,230
So right stick is... Good job. It's almost showtime, baby.

140
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,349
Just wait. Just wait. It doesn't matter. I don't know anything about football. All I

141
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,750
know is the Patriots are good. Tom Brady's cool. Tom Brady wins. Rings. That's all I

142
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,289
know. I don't know anything else. I know first down means that they get to play it again,

143
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:56,089
right? It's like getting... It's like re-spins. I just made a casino reference. Why did I do that?

144
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:08,220
I don't even like the casino. The casino sucks. Okay, how do I do that? First down.

145
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:18,789
Okay, hold down L2 to enter clash mode and use evade or power to make a clash move. This

146
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,059
is what we're talking about here. Yep. See? I can slow down time and shit.

147
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,190
Each clash icon adds a pip to your unleash meter. Finish filling your unleash meter

148
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:46,460
by performing a two-move combo in clash. There's one. There's two. There's three.

149
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,220
Look at the dumb shit you can do. So now I can break somebody's neck.

150
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,460
Every damn penny. Get out there and unleash on the first offender that gets in your way.

151
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,740
Score a rushing touchdown and then enter the following code. X, X, X, circle.

152
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:29,339
That guy dove from all the way across the fucking map. Oh! What's the code? I told you

153
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:38,140
that's nothing. Oh god. This is... Outstanding. I want five more just like that.

154
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:49,099
That guy just landed on his back very, very... It was like pillows. He had other issues going on.

155
00:21:49,099 --> 00:22:00,700
I didn't do that. All right, let's do some passing training. If I jumped as high as I could and

156
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,980
landed directly on my back as flat as I could, that wouldn't happen to me. My stomach wouldn't

157
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:17,289
explode. Yeah, it's so fun to... Time to test out that arm of yours. Keep it simple. Just hit

158
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:26,150
the first open receiver you see. Tap as a lob. Hold it down for a bullet. That's not bad. He knows

159
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:34,339
what he's doing. Clash after your quarterback evade blitzes. Run it by gaining yards and scoring

160
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:50,170
on offense. Yeah. Gain 30 yards to fill part of the clash meter. That was poetry in motion.

161
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,690
Keep it up. This sounds like young German. Okay, so you have a good arm, but how are

162
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,970
your feet? I am young. Think you can avoid getting planted during the blitz?

163
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,970
Pressing L2 to enter clash. When defenders are in range,

164
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,210
arrows will appear. Move the right stick towards an arrow to evade.

165
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:18,779
You can do better than that? Oh, it sounds like young you. What? That was weak sauce and you

166
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,900
know it. Give me something better, something spicy. Yeah, he sounds like young.

167
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,529
Weak sauce and you know it. Give me something better, something spicy. This is John Travolta.

168
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:41,109
No, um, what's his name? There it is. All right.

169
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,970
That was just what I was looking for. Not John. What's his name? John Cusack. You've got the D pissed

170
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,329
off now and they're coming for you. All right, execute QB, unleash evade and move the right

171
00:23:54,329 --> 00:24:01,940
stick towards an arrow when a defender's in range. Maybe you should try out for basketball.

172
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,619
I think I'm gonna snap this guy's neck. When you get unleashed, that's how you do the

173
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,339
horrible shit. This isn't college anymore, kid. You have to produce.

174
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,420
Show me what you've got. Towards the, towards the rusher, right?

175
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,730
This isn't college anymore, kid. You have to produce.

176
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:44,059
You're not even going to make the practice squad at this rate. How the fuck do I do that?

177
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I mean, it's probably a really strange time. I know you can do better than that.

178
00:24:51,960 --> 00:25:00,170
It's Jay Moore. Who did I say? I said somebody completely wrong. Who did I say this was?

179
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,089
The arrow? Yeah, I gotta wait for the arrow, but it's like, it pops up in a tenth of a second.

180
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:12,180
I gotta go towards the arrow. Like, I hit him so hard that I electrocuted his brain.

181
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:21,619
I didn't get tackled. Looking good. Don't let up now. You're looking like

182
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:24,339
the real deal, kid. All right, square passing touchdown. Now it's time to put all the pieces

183
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:28,500
together and give the fans a real show. Get in that end zone. Oh shit, I have to catch it.

184
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,599
What? Oh, I didn't do the code. I got tackled. Square, square, triangle, triangle.

185
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:55,130
That's a touchdown though. All right. Square, square.

186
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:07,269
Why am I doing this to my own teammate? That wasn't my own teammate.

187
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,160
It was like cartoon and punches. All right. Rushing, passing. We got that pretty much down.

188
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,859
This is very quick. They don't make games like this anymore. You know, when you could

189
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:26,940
just punch people on the other team or on your own team for that matter.

190
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:37,349
51 seconds left in the second quarter. And oh boy, third and two at the LA 40.

191
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Like anyone cares. Word around here is you have hands like flypaper. Well,

192
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,119
put the ball in the air and show me what you can do.

193
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,880
An open receiver. That's what I'm seeing here, kid. That was a nice catch, but let's see how

194
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,079
you do under real pressure. So you do a clash catch. Take some of your clash energy and

195
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:05,940
make sure you come down with the pass. Catch must be at least 20 yards. Okay. Got it.

196
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,829
And I broke the tackle too. I'm still good. Now that is the way to execute. It's fourth

197
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:20,309
and long here. So what are we going to do? Press and hold L2 while the ball is in the air

198
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:31,079
to enter clash. Catch that deep ball. Yeah, it's a guaranteed catch if you have full meter.

199
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,859
Don't let up now. That end zone is calling to you. Haul ass downfield and give the

200
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:40,940
networks their play of the week. Hold L2, the ball's in the air, press triangle to make

201
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,819
the intended receiver do an unleashed catch when the ball is in range.

202
00:27:45,180 --> 00:28:05,500
Uh, I didn't do it. These guys have made out of peanut brittle. These bones have made it a

203
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:14,549
candy floss. It's so delayed. The bones break like five seconds later. They have pretty bad

204
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:21,609
lag. All right. So I have to make them do it. So like this.

205
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:30,259
There we go. No, I was trying to hurt that guy. Freaking standing. What's a touchdown without

206
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,579
a good celebration? We're receiving touchdown then do XX circle circle. Get in the end zone,

207
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:42,170
pick a spot and show the fans your moves. No. Is it halftime? All right. Who's the

208
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:51,299
halftime show? Oh, it's halftime. No, that's going to be embarrassing. Nevermind.

209
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:03,240
And then what was it? XX square square? I don't remember what it was. Give us a

210
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:12,329
halftime show. Uh, I can't, I can't do a, I don't, I'm not prepared for this.

211
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:42,490
That's a fail. Why? XX circle circle, not square. Damn it. Beer chuck.

212
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,980
That's a $50,000 penalty. That one's a keeper. Great job.

213
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,059
Is that allowed in football? Uh, no, no, and none of it is actually.

214
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,119
Pain, injuries, glory. This is where we get to see the real pain.

215
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,990
The whole point of blitz the league is you're trying to make the other team injured.

216
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,369
You're trying to put people out, hurt them to a point where they can't play in the game anymore.

217
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,809
That's the point of this game. That's not the point of American football.

218
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:26,440
Looks like the offense is trying to pass on you. Are you going to take that?

219
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,000
X while tackling the ball carrier. Don't show those receivers what happens when they

220
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,119
try and catch a pass in your territory. I'm sorry. I thought you said you had skills.

221
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,160
Well, I need to know how to select a guy. Press X while tackling the ball carrier. So

222
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,200
where's my character? Hey, why don't you get your damn head in the game and try again?

223
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:50,440
Um, I, you need to tell me who I'm, where my character is. How do I select a new character?

224
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,789
Real deal. Looks like the switch into the run.

225
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:03,819
Press and hold L2 and press X to execute a dirty hit. That's what we want right here.

226
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:09,420
Dirty hit. That is the way to execute. Those fat linemen are trying to get in your face.

227
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,819
Like the lard asses they are.

228
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,880
That's a success. Nothing brings in the ratings like a sack.

229
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,400
Damn it. I didn't get any more kid. You have to produce.

230
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,049
It's not going to be ready. You got to go run right through.

231
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,480
You had skills. Now prove it. I'm also trying to do it. I don't have any time.

232
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:04,299
He's too good. He like gets rid of the ball immediately.

233
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,319
I know I'm the defender, but look at how quickly he gets rid of the ball.

234
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,099
Sack him. Sack him. That counts.

235
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,579
Give me this guy.

236
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,170
All right, he throws the ball. By the time my character takes a step, the ball's gone.

237
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:07,299
Are you using L2? Oh yeah. Jesus Christ.

238
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,529
Guys, I'm doing it correctly. I'm holding L2 and press. I've played this game before.

239
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,289
The tutorial. How is that a fail? I sack the quarterback.

240
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,400
It's just the tutorial. They forgot to program the

241
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,640
quarterback to hold the ball for more than a tenth of a second.

242
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm sorry. I thought you said you had skills. Now prove it.

243
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,819
What the fuck?

244
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:15,849
I'm going to go with another guy. I don't know. Why am I getting failures for sacking

245
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:25,829
the quarterback? All right. Do you see how fast he's throwing this ball?

246
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:35,460
And she's in a nursing home. Pathetic. That counts. That's a dirty hit. Jesus.

247
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,760
Christ. Time to make the ball carrier cry for his mama. Unleash on him with everything you've got.

248
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:50,469
All right. Unleash all the ball character press. Yeah, I got it. Suplex him on his head.

249
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,519
Oh, that guy's. You nailed that one. Keep going.

250
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,670
We didn't break any bones or hurt him. All right. Last thing.

251
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:06,869
And then we're going to do career mode. I'm going to do the whole career in the time

252
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:20,760
to take for. Who is the halftime show? Have we figured it out? SpongeBob.

253
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,260
It's not SpongeBob. Although that would be great if it was.

254
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,059
If you're going to play dirty, you need to learn to call your shots.

255
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:34,579
Hit the ball carrier hard. Pick the body part of your choice and make sure he doesn't get.

256
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,340
Oh, yeah. SpongeBob is the halftime show. That is absolute bullshit.

257
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:44,519
Perform dirty hit. Pick an injury using left and then pump it up by rapidly pressing X.

258
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:54,840
Step on it. Oh, OK. Right. I see. I see. That was weak.

259
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,679
I remember this. You have to, like, pick a place and then spam X.

260
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,349
You should try out for basketball. That guy ran into his own teammate.

261
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,369
Yeah. Bruce, those ribs. That was poetry in motion. Keep it up. Injuries happen.

262
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,329
That's why the training staff has a ready supply of juice.

263
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,530
Take aim, find the vein and get your comrade back on the field.

264
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,969
Position your syringe using left and then juice the injured player by pressing X.

265
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:41,690
Get a 50% or better result.

266
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:54,820
Here we go. Yes. You get steroids.

267
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,199
OK, here we go. Use a left stick to place the needle as close to the middle of target as

268
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,119
possible. The closer you get to the center, the quicker your player will get back into the

269
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:23,739
game. That was just what I was looking for. Sometimes the Jews just get in the middle.

270
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:28,059
You got to grab hold of what's broken and wrench it back into place.

271
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,500
Allow your player to get in and pull left and right to prepare for a bone set.

272
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,460
Then move left and right in indicated directions when prompted. Get a 50% or better.

273
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:45,670
Oh, that's a broken shoulder portion.

274
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,510
OK, move the left stick and right stick to their respected targets.

275
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,309
Once the targets are in place, mimic the arrows that appear to snap the bone back into place.

276
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,900
Sorry, dude. Sorry, dude.

277
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,460
Great intensity on that one. Keep going.

278
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:19,059
So I know how to play. Let's do it.

279
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:32,010
He's ready. So there are lots of things. We got campaign.

280
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,219
Oh, God. That's a whole storyline here.

281
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,780
Battaglia levels the quarterback. It's a fumble.

282
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:48,519
Football was coach thinking. Ten seconds left in a tie game.

283
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,639
And the Nightmare cough up the football on their own 20.

284
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,679
Frank Kelly. Is that the John Madden guy?

285
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,900
Got this one in the bag, sunshine.

286
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
The quarterback is down.

287
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,380
Looks like Battaglia may have ended his career.

288
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,460
It wouldn't be the first time.

289
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,099
Quit your whining.

290
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,219
Just stick him with a syringe.

291
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,559
Seamless transition into gameplay. Let's go.

292
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,719
I don't know how to kick a ball, though.

293
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,559
I have no idea how to kick a ball. There wasn't a tutorial for that.

294
00:39:49,590 --> 00:40:01,269
Oh, yeah. It's a fumble.

295
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,070
It's a fumble.

296
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,980
Neck break. So face mask running the whole time.

297
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:44,420
You'd be thrown out of the league to see Kingpin up in the...

298
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,780
Kid, you're going to be huge.

299
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,260
The first two-way player this league's ever seen.

300
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,099
I've got every Fortune 500 company panting to get into bed with you.

301
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,500
Like horny bridesmaids at the wedding of the century.

302
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,179
Do you really want to rock the boat?

303
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,010
Okay, kid, we're fucking on.

304
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:10,440
Excuse me, commissioner.

305
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,639
I wanted to introduce you to my new client.

306
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,760
Great to meet you, son.

307
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,559
Boys, take a look at our next big star.

308
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,119
Big star?

309
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,159
Is this like the opening GTA cinematic?

310
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,679
He's a one-man-walking franchise.

311
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,320
Hey, you know what? That's his new nickname, franchise.

312
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,679
Well, it's the evil mafia guy.

313
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,000
Franchise. I dig that.

314
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,440
Well, you'll certainly be the franchise player for the riot.

315
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,400
L.A. traded up to the number one pick to take you.

316
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,320
I don't like that voice.

317
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,119
I'm sorry, sir.

318
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:40,679
Not evil.

319
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,880
I won't be able to play for L.A.

320
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,840
Good one, sir. Good one.

321
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,719
It's no joke.

322
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,599
The only place I'm going to be able to play is in my hometown.

323
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,239
You'll play for the team that drafts you.

324
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,280
I'm sorry about this, but my mind's made up.

325
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,519
SpongeBob is not home.

326
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,360
Then he'll go play center field for New York.

327
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,519
They just offered him $17 million a year for seven years, guaranteed.

328
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,760
That's the kind of athlete you're looking at here.

329
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:19,349
Look, everybody knows you expanded your league too quickly.

330
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,030
I mean, six teams in five years.

331
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,429
Come on.

332
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:22,630
Now you're choking on it.

333
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,230
And your so-called owners raised the money for those new teams.

334
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,550
So you had to offer stock to the public.

335
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:33,989
And now you get a once in a lifetime cash cow who could save your league.

336
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,030
SpongeBob.

337
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,989
All he's asking for is to play for his hometown team.

338
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:42,070
SpongeBob is in the halftime.

339
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:50,789
They're doing sweet victory.

340
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,309
Thank you all for coming.

341
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,030
Today's a special day.

342
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,750
Are you kidding me?

343
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,389
My client.

344
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:55,909
I thought you guys were just fucking around.

345
00:42:55,909 --> 00:43:00,389
Most of you have been following his career as he smashed multiple collegiate records.

346
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:02,789
Now he's poised through the sand in the league.

347
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,869
So let's get the questions rolling.

348
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:05,989
Fogs one at a time.

349
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,750
Scott Smith, League Tribune.

350
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,309
How do you feel your presence on offense affects your teammates?

351
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:13,590
How do you feel your presence on offense affects your teammates?

352
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,550
I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.

353
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:20,869
As a running back, I know that I need to go out there and control the game.

354
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,630
They can rely on me to make the big catch.

355
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,750
I have the versatility to line up and block or split out wide.

356
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,389
What do I want to do?

357
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,119
I think isn't quarterback the most fun?

358
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,519
Quarterbacks like the most fun in a football game.

359
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:39,050
I'd go out there and deliver the passes.

360
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,050
I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.

361
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,969
The man is a playmaker.

362
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:45,690
Pure and simple.

363
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,730
Next question.

364
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,730
Now you're going to play offense and defense.

365
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,769
I'm a threat to the quarterback every play.

366
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,010
Uh, they can't contain me.

367
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,369
Any run or short yardage pass that enters my territory is going to be,

368
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,250
they're going to pay a price.

369
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,889
I'm the general of the secondary.

370
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,250
I'm everywhere I need to be.

371
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,210
I want that safety.

372
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,650
I'm the ultimate shutdown corner throwing to my receiver.

373
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,809
Nobody, I, I don't know what any of this means,

374
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,409
but I know that I want to be a safety.

375
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:14,170
I want to be the general.

376
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,929
I want to be the quarterback and I want to be the general.

377
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:17,369
And I want to be done safely.

378
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:19,369
I'm the general of the secondary.

379
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,809
I'm everywhere I need to be.

380
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,610
As you can see, confidence isn't an issue.

381
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:24,409
Who's next?

382
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:26,170
How about the looker in the front row?

383
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,210
Jennifer Mendez.

384
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:30,409
My readers are wondering what did you do for fun in your youth?

385
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:35,610
Uh, does running from the, I was best dodgeball mostly.

386
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:40,969
Um, what do I want?

387
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,690
Speed?

388
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,090
Strength?

389
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:45,769
I want agility.

390
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:50,010
I was the best dodgeball player in my neighborhood.

391
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:51,929
Plus two agility.

392
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,539
Little did the old neighborhood know they had a future super store on their hands.

393
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:58,099
Okay.

394
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:00,260
How about the gentleman in the back with his hand up?

395
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,460
Thanks.

396
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,059
Did you play any other sports in college?

397
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:04,579
Uh, we got base.

398
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,260
My curveball could have gotten me in pros.

399
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,420
Collegiate champion wrestler.

400
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:10,260
Track and field.

401
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,019
I played rugby as well as football.

402
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,219
Twice the pain.

403
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:13,719
Ooh.

404
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,320
Yep.

405
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,639
I play rugby as well as football.

406
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:18,920
Twice the pain.

407
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,880
You know, I want a good tackle.

408
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,920
I want to be able to hurt people.

409
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,400
This kid could have gone pro in a half dozen sports.

410
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,239
He's just that type of athlete.

411
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:25,880
Okay.

412
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,519
Next.

413
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,519
Jeff Jones, Midwest One News.

414
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:31,400
What's the thing most opponents don't realize about you?

415
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,280
I'm a team player.

416
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,320
I'll do the dirty work.

417
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,440
Glory doesn't matter.

418
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,079
Just the win.

419
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,719
I studied martial arts.

420
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,719
I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.

421
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:40,440
I think that's the one.

422
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,079
My hands are like flypaper once I've got the ball.

423
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:43,800
I'm holding on to it.

424
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,599
Catching me is one thing.

425
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:45,960
Bring me down is a whole different story.

426
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,119
I studied martial arts.

427
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,280
I studied martial arts.

428
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
So I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.

429
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,599
They'll be learning soon enough, huh?

430
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,519
Let's get someone who has not been called on yet.

431
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:57,960
I watch anime.

432
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,199
What have you been focusing on in the off season?

433
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,159
Hitting the blocking sled.

434
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,800
Full contact drills.

435
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,639
Running the obstacle course on a one-on-one.

436
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:13,909
Maybe.

437
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:19,699
I think any more strength.

438
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,059
Oh, no, maybe full contact.

439
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,269
Block, tackle.

440
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:24,469
No, what's BKT?

441
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:27,530
Back tackle?

442
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,500
I'm all about the full contact drills.

443
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,579
Got to train hard to play hard.

444
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,019
Take it from me.

445
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,219
This kid has been working his ass off all summer.

446
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:38,219
You're a QB with full tackle points.

447
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:40,219
He'll be ready to start day one.

448
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,340
Who's next?

449
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,179
Ms. Mendez, you have another question?

450
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:45,420
If you had to give yourself a nickname, what would it be?

451
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:47,739
Nickname.

452
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,139
The playmaker, the enforcer, the freak of the wall.

453
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,010
The enforcer.

454
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,369
Same as in college.

455
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,090
Folks can call me the enforcer.

456
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,369
Can we quote you on that?

457
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,659
Yeah, yeah, kid.

458
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:05,940
The laughing?

459
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,659
All right.

460
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:09,219
Looks like we only have time for a few more questions.

461
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:10,659
OK, Scott, go.

462
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,539
Which current player do you model your game after?

463
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,300
The speed demon.

464
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:17,539
Wide receiver.

465
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:18,900
The bullhawk.

466
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:22,809
Full stop.

467
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,489
Ezekiel.

468
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:25,690
The enforcer.

469
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:25,929
Me.

470
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:29,769
Laughback.

471
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,019
Running back.

472
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,179
The enforcer.

473
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:39,260
Don't hate me for this,

474
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,619
but I model my game after my boy, Bruno Bataglia.

475
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:44,139
We're just about out of time here.

476
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:45,739
Let's get in one final question.

477
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,019
Do an archer build.

478
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:47,739
Right there.

479
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,219
What do you want people to say about you five years from now?

480
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,739
I was one of the quickest guys to ever put on a pair of cleats.

481
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,460
Everything that I put my hands on, I'd bring it.

482
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,780
That kid could sure pack one hell of a punch.

483
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,820
You need a jet pack to be able to keep up with that guy.

484
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:02,619
Punching.

485
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,659
Five years, huh?

486
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,699
That kid sure packs one hell of a punch.

487
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all we have time for today.

488
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,159
And I want to thank you all for coming.

489
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:27,699
And I hope that you are as safe as I am about seeing him this coming season.

490
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:29,460
Why does it taunt me in every game?

491
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,429
Do I have to get taunted in every fucking game I play?

492
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:34,789
I don't know why.

493
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:42,869
Blazing fast scrambler with a lot of tackle.

494
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:45,690
First name, kid.

495
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:59,699
First name, Jax?

496
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:04,940
Overall, C.

497
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,710
I don't know if this is a Jax.

498
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:21,539
Frank?

499
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,789
Name him Pizza.

500
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,849
Mr. Super Bowl.

501
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:39,030
I like that.

502
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,949
Mr. Super Bowl.

503
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:44,469
The last name already is Franchise.

504
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:48,309
Oh, there he is.

505
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:50,309
Mr. Dave Super Bowl.

506
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:52,469
That's perfect.

507
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,900
But what if you never get to the Super Bowl?

508
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,579
Select your city.

509
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:01,900
All right.

510
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,460
Where is it?

511
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,429
Nope.

512
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,500
There it is.

513
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,219
Las Vegas.

514
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,190
The Las Vegas.

515
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,590
Oh, I get to name the team.

516
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,389
The Las Vegas.

517
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:22,969
The Las Vegas Aces.

518
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,239
No, the Las...

519
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,679
Eat this one.

520
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:30,039
The Las Vegas Dealers.

521
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,380
Yeah, the Vegas Dealers.

522
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,460
The Vegas Boomers.

523
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,159
Terrible Boomer.

524
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,159
The Vegas Boomers.

525
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,840
I'm not going to be the fucking Boomers.

526
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,369
The Las Vegas Super Bowlers.

527
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,820
No, this is so dumb.

528
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,260
Las Vegas Super Bowlers.

529
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,340
I can't even fit it.

530
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:34,039
Mr. Super Bowl of the Super Bowlers.

531
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:53,269
That word doesn't look right.

532
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,710
Is that correct?

533
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,750
Bowlingles?

534
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,389
Is that weird?

535
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:03,670
All right.

536
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,190
The Las Vegas Super Bowls.

537
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,559
Mr. Super Bowl on the team.

538
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,420
Anyway, that's a pretty...

539
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,300
That's pretty Vegas.

540
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,820
Is it just a bowl?

541
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:20,900
It has to just be like a bowl, right?

542
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:29,670
A middle finger.

543
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:37,190
Mr. Super Bowl of the Super Bowlers.

544
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:45,579
All right.

545
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,460
These two images?

546
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,579
This is just evolved version of George Washington.

547
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:51,909
This is Super Saiyan Washington.

548
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:56,010
We got a club.

549
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,070
What the fuck is that thing?

550
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,369
There are too many icons.

551
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,489
How about just a terrible default one?

552
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,949
I mean, come on.

553
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:31,690
How many icons?

554
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,570
Okay, we got to the end.

555
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,059
We got to do dice.

556
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:35,860
We're in Las Vegas.

557
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,610
And the team colors.

558
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,690
We've got to be the German 985 official colors.

559
00:53:42,250 --> 00:54:16,599
A little darker, I think.

560
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,679
Maybe a little bit lighter.

561
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,440
Like the light is bouncing in the right spot, you know?

562
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:29,860
Here's the uniform.

563
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,300
Holy fuck, that's ugly.

564
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,179
It's not.

565
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:36,380
That is very ugly.

566
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,619
Home uniform.

567
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:39,420
Helmet style.

568
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:55,300
And this is just like a...

569
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I need to swap it so it doesn't look...

570
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,719
What did italics say?

571
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:03,340
Polly Pocket?

572
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,050
Shut up!

573
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:13,300
No, this needs to be like that.

574
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,659
This is fine.

575
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:19,059
Like the...

576
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,949
Okay, that looks cool.

577
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,309
I'll keep that one.

578
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,329
All right.

579
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:24,809
Now, how do I...

580
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,809
Okay. Jersey.

581
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,789
That looks a lot better.

582
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,110
Right there.

583
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,409
Jersey font.

584
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,420
Super Bowl?

585
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:37,380
What?

586
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:37,780
Oh, right.

587
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,820
That's the name of the team.

588
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,780
I thought that...

589
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,659
I was like, what the fuck?

590
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:41,780
I like that.

591
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,360
Pants?

592
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:52,300
No.

593
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,159
I gotta break it up a little bit.

594
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:55,559
It's got...

595
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:56,599
I gotta break it up a little.

596
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:57,400
It looks so bad.

597
00:55:58,199 --> 00:55:59,139
Socks?

598
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:00,420
Where's the Star Wars socks, please?

599
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:09,289
So we got...

600
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,130
Mr. Super Bowl.

601
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,489
Captain of the Super Bowls.

602
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,579
He's pistachio ice cream, man.

603
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:33,139
Are we still at the halftime show?

604
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,019
How long is this shit?

605
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,300
Agent.

606
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:48,340
Keep them on the best supplements you can afford.

607
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,179
And don't forget about socializing.

608
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,300
Hit the club scene.

609
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
Make a name for yourself off the field as well.

610
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:21,699
All right.

611
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:22,579
So we got the trainer.

612
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,340
Roster stats.

613
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,300
Lifestyle.

614
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,960
I think you can go to jail in this game, if I remember.

615
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,179
You can get arrested for breaking stuff and punching people.

616
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:32,420
All right.

617
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,380
Wins to advance five.

618
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,019
Need...

619
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:35,940
I got seven division games remaining.

620
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,900
$100,000.

621
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:38,099
Trainer.

622
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:39,780
Juicing.

623
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,219
Oh, you can take drugs.

624
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:41,780
Now, okay.

625
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,179
Training.

626
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,230
Train your starting players yourself or have the team's trainer take care of it.

627
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,030
It's your call.

628
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:49,849
I want to do the training myself.

629
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:51,050
No, I don't.

630
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,170
This is way too many people.

631
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,960
Assign the trainers automatically.

632
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,380
Juicing.

633
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,860
You can juice up to three players each week

634
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,860
and different juices are more suited to different positions.

635
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,780
Keep an eye on your risk meter when buying illegal drugs.

636
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,739
As risk gets higher, so do the chances of getting busted by the league.

637
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,679
So should I take drugs?

638
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:13,000
No, not...

639
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,880
We don't need to do this.

640
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,280
Not yet.

641
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,679
Upgrades.

642
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,730
All right.

643
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,619
So for tackle, it's $105,000.

644
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:22,340
I don't have enough money.

645
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,900
We're just going to do it.

646
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,460
We're just going to play.

647
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:26,219
Lifestyle.

648
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,710
Girlfriends and sponsors.

649
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,940
These...

650
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,699
I haven't even made a name for myself.

651
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:33,179
Cheap Helm.

652
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:36,219
These cheaply made lids are as old as the league helmet policy.

653
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,699
They barely offer more protection than your skull.

654
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,769
So I don't have any sponsors.

655
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:42,329
Not yet.

656
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:43,369
I got to make a name for myself.

657
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:43,690
I got to...

658
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,010
Let's go.

659
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:49,619
Las Vegas must stay within five points at the final score to win.

660
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,480
I can bet money on my own team.

661
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:55,960
Max bet.

662
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,800
The Philadelphia Brawlers live up to their names with their style of play.

663
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,320
They cheat as much as they can and get away with far more than they should.

664
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,800
Defensive end, H.J. Latchaw was just another unruly Philly fan last year.

665
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,599
Until a fight spilled onto the field and Latchaw beat his ass to earn himself a child on the ball.

666
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:19,380
Pressed his history.

667
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,860
Just like a fat guy fan that came and beat everybody up.

668
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:31,940
Just the WWE NFL.

669
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,659
No, this is not an NFL.

670
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:37,380
This is the Blitz the League League.

671
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:43,050
There he is.

672
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,010
They got dirty defense, but they have very poor offense.

673
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,130
So they play dirty and they cheat, but they don't score very many points.

674
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:54,019
Remember, it's 30 yards for a first down.

675
00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:56,019
You know, I was hanging out the pool this morning before the game.

676
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:57,059
There he is.

677
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:09,159
What?

678
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:13,659
Why?

679
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,000
Maybe I had a diaper.

680
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,280
Oh, I love this game.

681
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,849
All right, we're going to go with uh, we're going to go with a

682
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,699
world record trail.

683
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:27,940
Passing play.

684
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:35,050
All right, got some yards.

685
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,929
Got a little yardage.

686
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:36,429
Seven yards.

687
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:39,340
Las Vegas diapers.

688
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,869
Boy, HP float.

689
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:47,940
One of them thinks we know what the hell we're why I didn't make the away uniform.

690
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:51,019
Watch this.

691
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,039
I didn't do it early enough.

692
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,820
There's no nudity.

693
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,940
What are you talking about nudity?

694
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,460
Oh, there's people dancing in the background.

695
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,960
Oops.

696
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,619
It's all right.

697
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:10,300
This is the hotline Miami team.

698
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,460
Oh, you dumb ass.

699
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:15,940
God damn it.

700
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,659
No, I'm going for it.

701
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,869
I'm going for it.

702
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,150
And they bring him down.

703
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,699
Las Vegas exploits an opening in the defense for some real yardage on that play.

704
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,619
We'll go with speed.

705
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:45,929
Uh, let's do uh, half back, double back.

706
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:47,769
Big series of downs upcoming.

707
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:49,050
All in about the 24.

708
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:57,849
All right.

709
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:58,889
That was bullshit.

710
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,650
What are you guys supposed to be?

711
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,250
Please tell me that wasn't his knee.

712
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:05,929
Hail Mary into the end zone.

713
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,710
And watch this.

714
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:09,829
I'm gonna fuck his wrong quarterback.

715
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:20,730
Perfect example of why they call him whatever it is they call him.

716
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:23,130
All right.

717
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,329
Now I gotta, I gotta kick it.

718
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:25,530
I gotta get a field goal here.

719
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:26,969
Field goal.

720
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:28,090
Fake field goal pass.

721
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:30,250
I need, I want two points.

722
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:37,739
That's a two point conversion, ladies and gentlemen.

723
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:40,599
Regular kickoff.

724
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:41,400
I don't know how to do this though.

725
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,159
What the fuck is going on?

726
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:56,619
Oh, take him down.

727
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,420
Okay.

728
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,619
So I'm on defense now.

729
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,659
We're going to go with uh, we're going to make cover plays.

730
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,119
Man up.

731
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,900
I'm the man in the back.

732
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:17,500
No, not very many yardage.

733
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,219
I'm good.

734
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:19,659
First, the first quarter's already over.

735
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:22,699
The first quarter as Las Vegas leads by eight.

736
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,500
Why does someone's balls explode?

737
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,699
You just, wait.

738
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,619
They'll happen very shortly.

739
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:38,170
Oh fuck.

740
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:38,809
Oh fuck.

741
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:39,289
Oh fuck.

742
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:44,940
Delphia gets some monster yardage on that play.

743
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:50,889
Don't forget about the bet.

744
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:52,250
I gotta be within five points.

745
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,489
Oh my god.

746
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:57,289
No, no, no.

747
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,250
I almost got the quarterback too.

748
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,150
Shit.

749
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,900
Goal line.

750
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,699
Just bump.

751
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:08,780
Everybody fucking just get in there.

752
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,309
This one thing has the safety.

753
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:21,670
It's all right.

754
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,710
They're only going to get one point.

755
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,579
No, they're going for it.

756
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:27,079
All right.

757
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:35,719
No, you don't get it.

758
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,440
No such thing as pass interference in this game.

759
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:48,380
Oh, we're going to catch this.

760
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,059
Why doesn't everybody just get it?

761
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:54,730
Shit.

762
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,690
I got a time loop there.

763
01:04:56,409 --> 01:05:00,440
Philadelphia has a super move where they're going to be able to hurt me real soon.

764
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,269
This one right here.

765
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:04,309
First down and 30.

766
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,869
I gotta be careful.

767
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:05,269
They could...

768
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,309
Something bad could happen right now.

769
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:09,960
What the fuck just happened?

770
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:12,280
Oh no.

771
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,840
I was trying to...

772
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,400
Okay.

773
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,440
I thought that was a running play.

774
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:25,739
Fuck.

775
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:27,300
I'm in trouble.

776
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,340
I'm going to have to kick a field ball.

777
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:30,980
Oh yeah.

778
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,579
We're tearing up the field here.

779
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:33,860
Let's do a trick play.

780
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:34,739
How about slip and dip?

781
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,699
I'm going with a slip and dip.

782
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:44,579
Oh no.

783
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:47,429
What did you do to my brain?

784
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:49,429
Am I dead?

785
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:51,429
Oh come on.

786
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:59,380
He turned off my brain.

787
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,010
It's all right.

788
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:04,969
He's only up three plays.

789
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,030
I brought it back to life.

790
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:16,380
All right.

791
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,099
I got to be careful.

792
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:17,500
I got to get...

793
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,380
I got to make a play here.

794
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:38,539
What?

795
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:39,420
Oh, how about stream?

796
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:43,820
Why did I do that?

797
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:44,539
Because I can.

798
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,650
No game.

799
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,980
They're taking a timeout.

800
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:55,300
What down is it?

801
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:56,500
Third down.

802
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:56,980
All right.

803
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,860
Let's stay...

804
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,500
Let's crush them with chaos.

805
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:01,860
I'm going to stay back.

806
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,199
Really?

807
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,800
You got to be kidding me.

808
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,440
That was two tackles that he...

809
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,239
He dodged them both.

810
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,139
He dodged two tackles?

811
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:28,840
Just fucking block it.

812
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:29,960
Get in there.

813
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,110
Don't mind.

814
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:35,750
All I need is one...

815
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,949
I need to touch it.

816
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:40,889
I need to touch it and I win the game.

817
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,099
All right.

818
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:49,420
Is there...

819
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,260
Oh no.

820
01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:53,380
No.

821
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,820
They keep turning my brain off.

822
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,780
It's going to be another fumble.

823
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,179
Isn't it?

824
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:56,659
No.

825
01:07:56,659 --> 01:08:03,829
Hold him still.

826
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,869
Hang on, buddy.

827
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:05,750
Only have three plays.

828
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:10,280
Only one stamina loss.

829
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,800
I need one more blip.

830
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:12,920
I got to...

831
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,159
Okay.

832
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:14,119
I got to get some yards here.

833
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:16,520
I want someone to knock that jackhole out of the game.

834
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:17,880
Perry.

835
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,439
We're going with this.

836
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:19,399
I'm going to go run and play.

837
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:19,960
I have to...

838
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,720
I have to get a good hit here.

839
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:25,720
Ow.

840
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,439
Oh, damn.

841
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,359
Timeout.

842
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:39,050
I'm going to go with the guy on the left.

843
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:45,899
I got it.

844
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,069
I have to get like an end zone pass right now.

845
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:50,949
We have to go for it.

846
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:54,279
Ah.

847
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:57,670
Triple nines.

848
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:08,710
Oh my god.

849
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:17,880
I did it.

850
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,199
All right.

851
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,079
Just kick a field goal.

852
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,079
I don't know how to kick a field goal though.

853
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:22,439
Just a field goal.

854
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:23,079
How do you do it?

855
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:30,810
Okay.

856
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,689
You just have to tap it.

857
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:33,699
On top.

858
01:09:33,699 --> 01:09:34,340
Who gets the ball?

859
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,109
It's good.

860
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:43,909
All right.

861
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:48,760
That was a good kick.

862
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:50,680
I got a full meter, by the way.

863
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,359
I'm not going to use it until I need to.

864
01:09:59,109 --> 01:09:59,829
Thank you.

865
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:10,970
Yeah, I can sprint with R2 instead of using the meter, right?

866
01:10:11,609 --> 01:10:11,850
All right.

867
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:12,729
We're going to stay balanced.

868
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,449
The offense looking at first and 30.

869
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:15,689
I want...

870
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:16,970
Should I try to break through his neck?

871
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,369
I wonder.

872
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:27,300
No hurt.

873
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,020
He didn't get hurt.

874
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:28,979
Ah.

875
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:31,079
I thought I was going to hurt him.

876
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,949
I was trying to like break his body.

877
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:43,899
What the fuck are you doing?

878
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:45,979
Hello?

879
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:52,300
All right.

880
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:52,779
Anticipate.

881
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:53,420
I'm going to stay back.

882
01:10:56,939 --> 01:11:01,140
I don't think so, buddy.

883
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:03,539
I'm going to pull this bullshit on me.

884
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:07,819
Fourth down.

885
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:08,859
What are you going to do?

886
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:13,239
Let's do prevention.

887
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,760
Just prevent.

888
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:16,699
No.

889
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,220
Just balance it up.

890
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,739
Lockdown.

891
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:21,050
They...

892
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,689
Oh, they can't...

893
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:22,729
They're punting it.

894
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:24,569
He's actually punting it in this game.

895
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,890
You go for it every time in this game.

896
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:27,609
What are you doing?

897
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,590
It's fake.

898
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,430
It's not fake.

899
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,600
Oh, god damn it.

900
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:40,119
It's all right.

901
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:47,619
Is that good?

902
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:48,979
That's a good question.

903
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:49,779
All right.

904
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:50,260
I got to get...

905
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,220
I have to get a parry here.

906
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:52,739
I have to.

907
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,939
I didn't think that that would work, but I just did it.

908
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,050
Franchise.

909
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,529
Corner look.

910
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:14,329
You can taunt.

911
01:12:15,609 --> 01:12:16,409
No, no, no, no.

912
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:24,149
Oh, I got some...

913
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:25,350
I got two points there.

914
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,350
Right there.

915
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,149
Two points there.

916
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:36,470
Got it.

917
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,390
Now, they need to score.

918
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,430
13, 14...

919
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,149
They get a score.

920
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:41,430
So I can get my money.

921
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,670
Right?

922
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:49,590
That's all right.

923
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,659
I'm gonna fucking hurt somebody.

924
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:56,710
I tried.

925
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:58,470
I tried to hurt somebody.

926
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,659
Am I actually...

927
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:01,220
So I just...

928
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,260
I have to be more than five.

929
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:10,920
I love the incomprehensible fake John Madden.

930
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,159
Yeah.

931
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:15,670
Three hits.

932
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,149
Yeah.

933
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:22,390
Uh...

934
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,590
How about zone?

935
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:25,829
I don't know what any of these mean.

936
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,100
I'm not gonna lie.

937
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,220
I don't know a thing about this.

938
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,260
All I know is that you punch people and you can suplex them on their back.

939
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:32,899
And they break their neck.

940
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:35,960
But wait for it.

941
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,600
Man, that's ugly.

942
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,760
I mean, you got your pretty and then you got your...

943
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,359
Can't get a date to the prom ugly.

944
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:41,239
And that's what that was.

945
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:42,439
But hey, what do you think about it?

946
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:44,680
I'm not the best looking corsage on lapel.

947
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,399
So in a way...

948
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:45,960
Yeah, think about it.

949
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:46,840
It's kind of beautiful.

950
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,800
Hard class.

951
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,199
It's the kind of ugly only a mother could find beautiful.

952
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:50,920
Oh, that's it.

953
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,119
Does that make sense?

954
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:53,000
What the hell is he saying?

955
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,279
As we reach the end of the third quarter,

956
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:56,119
Las Vegas leads by 10.

957
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,159
How was that?

958
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:59,640
How's the Super Bowl going?

959
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,390
Patriots have the ball.

960
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,350
Still three nothing.

961
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:07,699
Not the same bullshit.

962
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:17,880
Somebody get him!

963
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,840
First down yardage right there.

964
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,399
Give me a break.

965
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:22,199
How did nobody get him?

966
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:25,640
Super Bowl.

967
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:34,340
Nope.

968
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,859
Defender made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch.

969
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:42,979
Let's go with the lockdown.

970
01:14:44,949 --> 01:14:47,979
Spongebob is singing the Doom OST.

971
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:51,859
Oh!

972
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:56,920
Oh!

973
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:09,579
I got a full meter.

974
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:10,220
I'm going for it.

975
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,260
I'm going for the kill shot here.

976
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:14,359
I gotta get that ball.

977
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:17,289
We're going with the...

978
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:19,369
We're going with the fucking total blitz here.

979
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,569
I...

980
01:15:20,569 --> 01:15:20,970
Someone's...

981
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,609
I gotta go for it.

982
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:29,319
It's all right.

983
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:48,310
Still ahead.

984
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,350
I need to get another touchdown.

985
01:15:49,989 --> 01:15:53,210
Are they gonna kick on sides?

986
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:53,609
They might.

987
01:15:54,489 --> 01:15:54,890
Are they?

988
01:15:55,689 --> 01:16:03,659
Oh, no.

989
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,060
That's my...

990
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,460
I...

991
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:18,329
Okay.

992
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:19,369
So...

993
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:21,130
Fuck this.

994
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,489
Hail Mary all the way down.

995
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:24,649
And I'm gonna do an unleash catch and catch it.

996
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:36,859
Why would you turn around?

997
01:16:42,619 --> 01:16:43,020
Balance.

998
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,659
We're gonna do...

999
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:44,140
Okay.

1000
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,020
I need to get a good...

1001
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,590
I'm not gonna unleash this yet.

1002
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,550
Let's throw the clock out.

1003
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:58,949
All right.

1004
01:16:58,949 --> 01:16:59,909
That's the first down.

1005
01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:00,789
They're doing a timeout.

1006
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:03,590
I'm gonna run again.

1007
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,670
I'm gonna run again.

1008
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,949
It would probably make people sick.

1009
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:05,510
Especially me.

1010
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:06,710
But I still wish I could do it.

1011
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:08,550
Red zone offense here.

1012
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,960
We gotta say about that.

1013
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,000
See you later.

1014
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:23,350
Oh!

1015
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:24,630
What the hell are you talking about?

1016
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:26,069
They don't have a meter either.

1017
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:26,470
It's over.

1018
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:32,470
Zero meter.

1019
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:42,819
That's my game today.

1020
01:17:42,819 --> 01:17:43,060
Yeah!

1021
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:45,159
Just kick it off normally.

1022
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:46,600
I just don't really feel comfortable in my pants.

1023
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,720
I don't know what it is.

1024
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,840
I know I'm supposed to wear them.

1025
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,960
I'm expected to wear them.

1026
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,600
Something keeps telling me not to trust them.

1027
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,159
See if I can get an injury here.

1028
01:17:57,159 --> 01:17:58,279
That was fucking pretty good.

1029
01:17:58,279 --> 01:17:58,840
But didn't...

1030
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,479
I didn't injure him.

1031
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:00,439
Just took his stamina down.

1032
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:06,119
Who the hell is this?

1033
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:07,560
It's supposed to be John Madden.

1034
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,600
But not John Madden.

1035
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,720
It's like fake John Madden.

1036
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:16,899
I have to injure somebody.

1037
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:22,729
Why did you fall down?

1038
01:18:26,779 --> 01:18:27,819
Break us back in half!

1039
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:31,229
Yeah!

1040
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:34,630
Why am I excited about that?

1041
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:42,550
Break us back in half!

1042
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:44,300
It's the game.

1043
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,659
It's the video game doing it to me.

1044
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:50,060
Now we're just going for something more dire than that.

1045
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:59,020
Jerma wants blood.

1046
01:18:59,899 --> 01:19:03,859
I'm gonna get it.

1047
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:05,779
You'll see it.

1048
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:07,140
I'm gonna tear somebody's leg off.

1049
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,909
I can't do nothing.

1050
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:15,930
Let's do balance.

1051
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:18,090
Coming back in.

1052
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:24,100
All right.

1053
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,100
I got one more opportunity to really hurt somebody.

1054
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,119
Get a pass.

1055
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:35,739
That would have been it probably.

1056
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:41,939
This is the last attempt.

1057
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:46,899
Oh, that's it.

1058
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:47,859
That's it.

1059
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,779
Game over.

1060
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,020
I'll take my money too.

1061
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,859
Can I still hurt somebody you think?

1062
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:57,939
Let's try to hurt somebody.

1063
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:03,539
Come here.

1064
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,020
Come on!

1065
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,979
You can do it!

1066
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:12,659
You can do another touchdown.

1067
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:13,159
Taunt!

1068
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,300
So Las Vegas wins the game.

1069
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,699
37 to 1.

1070
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:25,199
I'll take it.

1071
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:29,289
Beat Philadelphia.

1072
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,170
Passing yards.

1073
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:30,810
Rushing yards.

1074
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,689
Return yards.

1075
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:32,090
Sacks.

1076
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:32,489
Fumbles.

1077
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:32,989
Recovered.

1078
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,020
22 times 2.

1079
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:39,340
Okay.

1080
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:39,899
5k.

1081
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:40,779
Unleash dirty hits.

1082
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:42,779
That's how you make money.

1083
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:45,609
Wager.

1084
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:46,109
Winner.

1085
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,479
$207,000.

1086
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:55,369
You've unlocked concept art.

1087
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:56,729
Movies.

1088
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:58,729
Jackpot trophy.

1089
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:02,060
This game's very fun.

1090
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,239
What's your trophy level now?

1091
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:05,960
I have no idea.

1092
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:10,970
Phone.

1093
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,409
We're off to a good start.

1094
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,970
Keep it up and you'll be drawing all the right kinds of attention.

1095
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,409
I'm talking sponsors, of course.

1096
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:20,329
The better you play, the more sponsors will come looking for your endorsement.

1097
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:23,449
And that means some sweet new equipment for you and your team.

1098
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:24,329
Jerma agent.

1099
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,270
Oh, it's Kim.

1100
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,069
Kim, what's up?

1101
01:21:28,069 --> 01:21:29,109
Hi franchise.

1102
01:21:29,109 --> 01:21:29,750
This is Kim.

1103
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,590
I'm acting on behalf of your agent to explore your marketing potential.

1104
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:36,949
You are already generating major interest.

1105
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:39,430
If you can put in a strong performance this Sunday,

1106
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:42,310
I can work my magic with the sponsors.

1107
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:42,630
Okay.

1108
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,430
Franchise must gain over 200 combined yards.

1109
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:48,100
Okay.

1110
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:50,420
Wow.

1111
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,779
What a game.

1112
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:53,460
How many yards did you rack up?

1113
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,899
Hell, I stopped counting.

1114
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:55,460
But whatever.

1115
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,989
As it gave our new sponsor a major hard-on.

1116
01:21:57,989 --> 01:22:00,069
They couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line.

1117
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:04,380
You're awarded the protector helmet by value tech.

1118
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:12,949
Sponsor's protector is plus two to resist injury.

1119
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,109
The name on the helmet says it all.

1120
01:22:15,109 --> 01:22:16,869
It isn't the most comfortable headgear in the world,

1121
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:20,310
but it will certainly protect your players from wide variety of injuries

1122
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,510
that other helmets would not.

1123
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,279
All right, nice.

1124
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:26,619
Is it on?

1125
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:27,819
It's just on, right?

1126
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:28,220
Yeah.

1127
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,180
Okay.

1128
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,340
So I want, let's see here.

1129
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,140
I got money, right?

1130
01:22:33,939 --> 01:22:39,350
Let's see.

1131
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:43,770
It's 125,000 for the first level.

1132
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,300
I need some better speed.

1133
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,939
I think so.

1134
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,140
Put ankle weights on.

1135
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,060
Provides a little extra resistance in training sessions

1136
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,380
to really strengthen those quad and calf muscles.

1137
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:57,979
Tackling.

1138
01:22:57,979 --> 01:22:59,979
This will keep all the offensive players healthy

1139
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:02,859
and practice and allow defenders to unleash on some helpless pads.

1140
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:09,100
Tackle.

1141
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:16,279
And this is why I'm not parrying well.

1142
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:19,880
Because it's break tackle.

1143
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,800
It was so low.

1144
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:23,770
That's why.

1145
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:26,710
I think there was only like 11 points.

1146
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:30,380
Breaking tackles.

1147
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,180
I can't do them.

1148
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,300
I need to, I have to put this on.

1149
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:38,489
That's all right, but no.

1150
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:39,130
Who's injured?

1151
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,689
Each staff subtracts one week.

1152
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:44,649
Broken collarbone.

1153
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:46,359
Okay.

1154
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:49,340
So he's out for one game.

1155
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:52,489
Upgrade facilities.

1156
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:55,369
Purchase adds two additional staff of 15 grand.

1157
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:56,170
Yeah, just do it.

1158
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:56,729
One as well.

1159
01:23:57,369 --> 01:24:00,229
All right.

1160
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:01,750
Now who should illegally juice?

1161
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,819
Offense.

1162
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:06,859
I'm going to juice this week.

1163
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,239
Choose drop.

1164
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,600
Reduce the stamina loss from tackles by 25%.

1165
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:15,319
It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs in the market,

1166
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:17,640
but it's very effective in keeping the body healthy for a long haul.

1167
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:20,039
Trilafine.

1168
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:22,039
Decreases class drains by 25%.

1169
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,739
I just spit all over myself.

1170
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:30,180
Everyone's so like sad about this.

1171
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,500
Just taking a shitload of drugs.

1172
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,300
Increases the stamina loss to opponents by 50%.

1173
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,840
Speed up, speeds up the heart rate and delivers enormous amounts of energy.

1174
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:45,060
Turbo bar drains 50% slower.

1175
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:48,180
Reduces the chance and severity of injuries.

1176
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:59,770
Regenerate two stamina each play they're on the field.

1177
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:01,770
Reduce stamina loss from tackles.

1178
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,210
Let's do, I like this one.

1179
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:06,170
Increases the stamina loss to opponents.

1180
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:10,810
We're not going to go too crazy here.

1181
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:18,420
The team, team risk is, I don't want to get it any higher than that.

1182
01:25:20,409 --> 01:25:21,210
Mr. Super Bowl.

1183
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:25,939
Go crazy.

1184
01:25:25,939 --> 01:25:27,619
No, no, why would I do that?

1185
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:31,420
All right.

1186
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,819
So I have to get a lot of yards here, right?

1187
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:39,859
Max bet.

1188
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:40,739
No, I don't know.

1189
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:42,100
Let's do a $5,000 bet.

1190
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:42,819
I'm not going to be crazy.

1191
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:44,899
Minus 16.

1192
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:49,289
Las Vegas must win by more than 16 points.

1193
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:50,890
No, that's not going to happen.

1194
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:51,529
That's a lot.

1195
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,529
I'll give $1,000 to it.

1196
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:56,329
They're a better team anyways.

1197
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:01,449
Their stats are just overall better than mine.

1198
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:04,659
So I got to play good here.

1199
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:07,750
You're taking this game seriously.

1200
01:26:09,989 --> 01:26:10,789
It's really fun.

1201
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:20,470
He's a warrior and the spearhead of the Bearcat offense.

1202
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,029
There's only one man to fear.

1203
01:26:23,029 --> 01:26:25,989
So defend the spirit attack by aiming for him.

1204
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:26,310
Okay.

1205
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:30,949
Pazzi's taken a lot of pounding, but he's still as sharp and lethal as ever.

1206
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:33,270
Baltimore.

1207
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:37,770
Watch the offense.

1208
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:45,050
Still three nothing Patriots in the Super Bowl.

1209
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,510
Welcome to the Super Bowl party.

1210
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:50,020
There's no party.

1211
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,800
It's just me and NFL, not NFL.

1212
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:55,640
It's just blitz the league too.

1213
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:59,159
We'll be having a party time.

1214
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:02,699
Get extra money.

1215
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,829
I get extra money for injuring.

1216
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:09,029
Oh my God.

1217
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:09,750
Those are ugly.

1218
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,840
That's an eyesore.

1219
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,470
He didn't even catch it.

1220
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:24,810
Bench that guy.

1221
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,439
Do I need to get the yards or how does it work?

1222
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:40,439
Oh, that was two though.

1223
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:41,319
That was two stiff arms.

1224
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:42,119
Good thing I trained it.

1225
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,199
They're not gonna do the same play again.

1226
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:47,399
They're not even gonna fucking see it coming.

1227
01:27:49,960 --> 01:28:08,869
Are you kidding me?

1228
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:13,479
How is that possible?

1229
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,869
This is the guy.

1230
01:28:16,869 --> 01:28:17,590
That's the guy.

1231
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:21,449
Nice tackle and beat the shit out of him too.

1232
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:21,930
This is the guy.

1233
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,989
Oh, he fought me off.

1234
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:32,949
That's the guy though.

1235
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,029
I got a, I got a power.

1236
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:35,909
I'm going for it.

1237
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,260
It's going to go.

1238
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,380
We're going to go anticipate.

1239
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,819
I'm going to, I'm going to injure this dude.

1240
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:43,619
I'm going right for his legs.

1241
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:50,460
He's done.

1242
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:50,779
Got him.

1243
01:28:57,189 --> 01:29:02,060
You're out of here.

1244
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,819
Out for 10 games.

1245
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:06,170
10 games.

1246
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:06,569
He's gone.

1247
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,100
Ruptured Spleen.

1248
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:13,609
That was the guy.

1249
01:29:13,609 --> 01:29:14,729
That was the intro cinematic.

1250
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,800
Just ruined his career.

1251
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,020
Well, that's up.

1252
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,539
Oh, they're punting it.

1253
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:28,039
Shit.

1254
01:29:28,819 --> 01:29:31,399
Why would you punt from here?

1255
01:29:32,119 --> 01:29:33,079
You don't have that far to go.

1256
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,289
Okay.

1257
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:46,569
So we got the ball again.

1258
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:50,149
We're going to go with a empty.

1259
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,739
They cross over the field.

1260
01:29:53,739 --> 01:29:55,340
We're going to try to catch them and cross over.

1261
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,020
Ball at the 17 yard line.

1262
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:00,539
There.

1263
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:05,880
Got it.

1264
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,399
Las Vegas with a nice game there.

1265
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:08,439
Oh, I didn't get the first down.

1266
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:11,579
I can run that.

1267
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:12,060
Let's just go.

1268
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:16,439
For some.

1269
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:18,979
No, boat left.

1270
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:19,939
I had to step over.

1271
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:24,250
Oh, damn.

1272
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:24,729
Okay.

1273
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:26,010
He really took a shot.

1274
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:26,649
Okay, fine.

1275
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:27,869
Whatever.

1276
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,439
I'm just going to be going for it again.

1277
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:42,020
Take it.

1278
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,340
That was some exhibition of raw running ability.

1279
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,779
You can't teach that kind of talent.

1280
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:47,380
All right.

1281
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:48,260
Let's go with balance.

1282
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:49,460
I'm going to pass play.

1283
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:51,140
Brash out.

1284
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:51,939
We're going for the guy on the right.

1285
01:30:56,439 --> 01:31:04,020
Wait, fourth down.

1286
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,619
And so at the end of one quarter of play.

1287
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:06,340
Didn't I get a first down?

1288
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:06,979
We're scoreless.

1289
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:12,520
No, that wasn't a first down.

1290
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:13,800
What can we do?

1291
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,319
We got to boot it.

1292
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:24,890
Open.

1293
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:25,210
Hold on.

1294
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:25,689
Wait, wait, wait.

1295
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:30,520
To the right side.

1296
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,239
Got it.

1297
01:31:31,239 --> 01:31:32,039
That's a first down.

1298
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:34,119
Stopped at the 21 yard line.

1299
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:34,520
Hold on.

1300
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:34,920
Wait, wait.

1301
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,399
Open the link.

1302
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:35,960
What are you doing?

1303
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,680
What is happening?

1304
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,229
Oh, my God.

1305
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:47,819
That is.

1306
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,500
Okay, cool.

1307
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,060
That's good.

1308
01:31:53,859 --> 01:31:54,899
I'll do it the other way.

1309
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:57,220
I want to see it from both sides.

1310
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,140
I want the bottom to be me and the top to be him.

1311
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:01,210
That's wonderful though.

1312
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:05,539
Do it the other way.

1313
01:32:05,539 --> 01:32:06,979
First down yardage right there.

1314
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:07,300
The offense is looking good.

1315
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,420
I got a first down.

1316
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,060
They're driving.

1317
01:32:10,949 --> 01:32:11,670
I'm going for.

1318
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,500
I like this one.

1319
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:17,979
This fade.

1320
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:20,899
Touchdown.

1321
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:21,220
Here we go.

1322
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:23,460
And I should have full meter for the next.

1323
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:25,670
We can go ready.

1324
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:25,909
Watch.

1325
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:26,390
Watch X.

1326
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,869
Watch X.

1327
01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:31,430
That's a beautiful catch.

1328
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:35,979
I'm going to play it safe.

1329
01:32:35,979 --> 01:32:36,619
I'm just going to kick it.

1330
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:44,899
Just get the.

1331
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:46,260
The extra point is good.

1332
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:51,479
Just regular kickoff.

1333
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:52,279
No messy stuff.

1334
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,550
Now let's try to hurt someone.

1335
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:01,060
First chance I get right here.

1336
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:16,279
Oh, that's 13.

1337
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:18,279
Just give me another one for free.

1338
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:20,760
You ever had that acid reflux, you know, with the heart burden,

1339
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,680
and then, you know, with the rest of it, all that kind of stuff.

1340
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:27,939
14 nothing.

1341
01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:28,979
And the extra point is good.

1342
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,449
Hey, another thing we just did.

1343
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:34,010
Let's do it again.

1344
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:39,930
Do I have full meter?

1345
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,850
I don't have full meter, but I can still hurt somebody.

1346
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:45,800
There it is.

1347
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,000
All right.

1348
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,640
Stomp on his head.

1349
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,050
I got meter again.

1350
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:53,529
Let's go for it.

1351
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:58,659
They are actual garbage without their crutch player.

1352
01:33:58,659 --> 01:34:02,060
Yeah, we're going to get the ball back again.

1353
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,130
First down, 30 yards.

1354
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:05,529
Really good thing.

1355
01:34:05,529 --> 01:34:06,090
I took him up.

1356
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:08,470
See if I can get the ball back.

1357
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:16,119
What just happened?

1358
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:23,989
Oh, there it is.

1359
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:24,390
There it is.

1360
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:28,020
Hold on.

1361
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:28,420
New one.

1362
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:33,750
Jesus.

1363
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:40,659
Oh, what is that?

1364
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:43,859
Oh, this is a ready player one avatar.

1365
01:34:43,859 --> 01:34:44,579
I don't like this.

1366
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:55,270
That's me going in the Oasis and hanging out.

1367
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:00,220
All right.

1368
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,779
Uh, show us.

1369
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:03,979
Hold on.

1370
01:35:03,979 --> 01:35:04,380
I need to.

1371
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:07,239
Yeah, this is worth saving.

1372
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:11,720
This is what I'm talking about.

1373
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,069
And I'm going to take a piss break, by the way, while you stare at this image.

1374
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:22,460
This is what I'm talking about when I say my ready player one avatar.

1375
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,789
How the hell did you even do this?

1376
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:26,970
All right, I'll be right back.

1377
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,710
All right, hold on.

1378
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,029
Hold on.

1379
01:35:49,029 --> 01:35:51,430
Before I go, you know what this reminds me of?

1380
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:52,390
This looks like.

1381
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,880
This looks like this is supposed to be here.

1382
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,569
Do you know what I mean by that?

1383
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:00,659
How this is like what?

1384
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:01,859
German 985 stream.

1385
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:02,819
I'll be right back.

1386
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:07,619
It's like a cartoon kind of 3D version of me, like a YouTuber kind of thing.

1387
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:15,930
This looks like it's I'm supposed to have this here.

1388
01:36:15,930 --> 01:38:45,300
All right, I hate this image.

1389
01:38:46,819 --> 01:38:57,460
What am I looking at?

1390
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:03,720
Oh, no, let me like do like, let me deep dive this.

1391
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,119
Hold on.

1392
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,260
How did you even make this?

1393
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:17,800
That's so weird and scary that this is possible.

1394
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,779
Welcome back to the show.

1395
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:32,140
It's German 985.

1396
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:44,069
Oops, hold on.

1397
01:39:44,069 --> 01:39:45,029
Welcome back.

1398
01:39:45,029 --> 01:39:46,149
It's me, German.

1399
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:47,189
Welcome back to the show.

1400
01:39:47,750 --> 01:40:14,569
How do I get this off?

1401
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:22,100
His teeth aren't showing.

1402
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,039
Side by side.

1403
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:24,520
No, I.

1404
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:26,119
Oh, don't limit it.

1405
01:40:26,119 --> 01:40:27,399
Don't just crush me.

1406
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:31,579
That's so loud.

1407
01:40:31,579 --> 01:40:38,739
Oh, I look at OBS and I crack a tab and it blows out the audio every time.

1408
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:42,779
It's a Coke.

1409
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:44,140
I'm going to prove it.

1410
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,020
There, proved it.

1411
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:49,800
Now, hopefully the game didn't crash.

1412
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,520
Me trying to prove it.

1413
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,199
All right, so I got to beat by more than,

1414
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:53,720
I got to win by more than 16 points.

1415
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,479
Should have bet fucking max bet on this.

1416
01:40:58,199 --> 01:40:59,239
I'm going to get it.

1417
01:40:59,239 --> 01:41:02,310
Can we test the sync here, by the way?

1418
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:04,229
One, two, three, four.

1419
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:05,189
One, two, three.

1420
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,970
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1421
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:09,449
We good?

1422
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:16,180
All right, I get the ball, right?

1423
01:41:16,979 --> 01:41:17,859
How the Patriots do it?

1424
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,890
Oh, fuck, it's tied up.

1425
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:24,010
It's tie game.

1426
01:41:24,729 --> 01:41:25,210
Three to three.

1427
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:25,930
They got a field goal.

1428
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:31,029
What in the name of fucking God just happened?

1429
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,579
They just Donkey Kong barreled.

1430
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,260
They with the barrels.

1431
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,579
The ball was Donkey Kong.

1432
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:46,359
Offense with a long way to go here on third down.

1433
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,979
Take his helmet off.

1434
01:41:53,979 --> 01:41:58,090
All right, this is fourth down.

1435
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:58,729
Are they going to punt it?

1436
01:41:58,729 --> 01:42:00,569
15 yards to go.

1437
01:42:00,569 --> 01:42:02,149
Hold on.

1438
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:02,949
Wait, wait, wait.

1439
01:42:02,949 --> 01:42:03,989
They're going to punt, aren't they?

1440
01:42:03,989 --> 01:42:04,869
Punt return.

1441
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:05,670
Yeah, they are.

1442
01:42:13,819 --> 01:42:15,140
I don't have any meter though.

1443
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:17,060
He didn't even catch that.

1444
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:18,020
It just bounced in his hands.

1445
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:21,619
Sheds a tackle and he's brought down.

1446
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:23,140
I got something for shedding that tackle, didn't I?

1447
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:25,689
Another one.

1448
01:42:25,689 --> 01:42:26,090
Hold on.

1449
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,810
What is this one?

1450
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,420
These are all so...

1451
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,329
I just looked at the other one.

1452
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:39,289
This one is also as detailed.

1453
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:41,529
And there are more.

1454
01:42:45,609 --> 01:42:46,170
Okay, guys.

1455
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:51,020
It's getting to a point where people, when they search me,

1456
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:53,100
they're not going to know what the real one is.

1457
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:59,479
Let's just put them all up on the screen eventually here.

1458
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,159
Let me just like, let me get to the end of this.

1459
01:43:05,779 --> 01:43:06,100
I got it.

1460
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,300
Okay, that's scaring me.

1461
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,579
I need to close that.

1462
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:10,260
End of the third quarter in the Super Bowl, by the way.

1463
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:15,930
All right, let's go.

1464
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:17,130
Let's do a pass play.

1465
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:17,850
Big cross here.

1466
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,560
I have 200 images of your face.

1467
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,720
No one should have that many faces.

1468
01:43:27,289 --> 01:43:27,789
Got it.

1469
01:43:30,779 --> 01:43:39,199
Yes.

1470
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:43,020
And that's a full meter.

1471
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,899
Without their, without that player there, they are absolutely worthless.

1472
01:43:49,619 --> 01:43:50,180
That's it.

1473
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:50,420
Fuck it.

1474
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,300
We're just going to run it.

1475
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,100
I got a full meter.

1476
01:43:52,739 --> 01:43:53,859
We're going to do an HP crush.

1477
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:04,279
The version is good.

1478
01:44:04,279 --> 01:44:05,079
Speaking of full meter.

1479
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:06,520
Got it back.

1480
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:10,359
And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 22.

1481
01:44:10,359 --> 01:44:11,880
It's a good thing that you killed that guy.

1482
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:18,819
Jerma actually knows that he's...

1483
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:20,579
Jerma actually sounds like he knows what he's talking about.

1484
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:23,609
I know some sports stuff.

1485
01:44:23,609 --> 01:44:24,109
Some.

1486
01:44:24,649 --> 01:44:25,149
Oops.

1487
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:28,869
I know that this first one.

1488
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,000
You know, I know what that is.

1489
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:33,689
Crank his fucking neck.

1490
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:35,310
Really?

1491
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:37,640
That's too bad.

1492
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:40,010
Is it 85% though?

1493
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:50,300
I don't really follow football that well considering, if you think about it.

1494
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:51,260
First and 30.

1495
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:54,539
The New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl right now.

1496
01:44:55,579 --> 01:44:58,699
And I have a browser tab open just seeing how the score is.

1497
01:45:06,619 --> 01:45:09,020
So, I mean, I'm not that much of a big fan.

1498
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,220
Of the sport.

1499
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,899
I do think it's interesting sometimes.

1500
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:15,180
Baltimore leads by 22.

1501
01:45:15,979 --> 01:45:17,340
Let's see if I can make something happen here.

1502
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:19,819
I got a long way to go.

1503
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:27,079
Cheerleaders.

1504
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,920
They really are doing just that kind of the dumbest dances.

1505
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:34,229
To me, this is mocap.

1506
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,960
Okay.

1507
01:45:36,819 --> 01:45:46,739
That was a fumble.

1508
01:45:50,069 --> 01:45:51,750
This is a big fourth down coming up.

1509
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:55,130
Are they going to punt it?

1510
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:56,489
You need to shut them down.

1511
01:45:56,489 --> 01:45:57,210
They had to punt it.

1512
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:08,199
Am I going to shut this team up?

1513
01:46:09,159 --> 01:46:10,439
Again, I didn't even catch it.

1514
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:13,449
Holy fuck.

1515
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:18,279
I ran out of gas.

1516
01:46:18,279 --> 01:46:18,779
It's okay.

1517
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:22,170
Let's go with...

1518
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:22,489
Let's do it.

1519
01:46:22,489 --> 01:46:24,890
Let's do our own Donkey Kong barrel play.

1520
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,449
Bring it back.

1521
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:41,420
I gotta be careful.

1522
01:46:42,859 --> 01:46:43,340
Don't run it.

1523
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:43,979
I gotta pass it.

1524
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:48,329
I could get a fumble here or somebody get hurt.

1525
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,689
Oh.

1526
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:57,500
Okay.

1527
01:46:58,359 --> 01:46:58,920
Trick play.

1528
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:01,319
Break delay.

1529
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:01,819
No.

1530
01:47:02,279 --> 01:47:02,920
Snowflake.

1531
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,060
Maniac.

1532
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,720
They just go all over the place.

1533
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:12,979
How's this for a maniac?

1534
01:47:12,979 --> 01:47:13,479
Wide open.

1535
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:15,500
Just land.

1536
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,140
Land, land.

1537
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,020
I'm not getting unleashed.

1538
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:21,340
If you don't know, if he uses Unleashed,

1539
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:27,340
there's a high chance that he'll break my neck or will fumble.

1540
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:29,340
So I need to just down myself.

1541
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,739
No!

1542
01:47:33,739 --> 01:47:34,539
That's what I'm talking about.

1543
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,869
I survived.

1544
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:52,970
The rambling boomer is the best part of the game.

1545
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:55,590
Everything is a boomer.

1546
01:47:57,850 --> 01:47:59,210
Everything is a boomer.

1547
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:02,569
All adults over the age of like 30 are boomers.

1548
01:48:09,939 --> 01:48:10,500
God damn it.

1549
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,460
And it's a touchback.

1550
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:11,960
Shit.

1551
01:48:18,819 --> 01:48:20,180
A boomer in the background.

1552
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:28,729
Get it back!

1553
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:29,930
No!

1554
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:30,430
Shit!

1555
01:48:31,689 --> 01:48:48,140
That was so abrupt.

1556
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,640
Oh, man.

1557
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,199
He just bounced off the ropes.

1558
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:02,600
And I just...

1559
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,319
Why won't they make another one of these?

1560
01:49:08,819 --> 01:49:09,380
Seriously.

1561
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,539
I don't even give a shit about football, really.

1562
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:13,060
Oh, God.

1563
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,100
I would play this all day.

1564
01:49:16,539 --> 01:49:17,750
Fourth down still.

1565
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:22,569
Are they gonna punt?

1566
01:49:22,569 --> 01:49:23,210
You can't punt.

1567
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:24,010
You have to go for it.

1568
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:26,409
Fourth and long.

1569
01:49:26,409 --> 01:49:28,010
They really need a big play here.

1570
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:31,239
Come back, come back, come back.

1571
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:38,180
All right.

1572
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,140
Let's go for a shutout.

1573
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:47,939
He doesn't have any meter or anything.

1574
01:49:51,979 --> 01:49:53,100
That's just getting embarrassing.

1575
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,300
That's embarrassing.

1576
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:04,100
There's a new image.

1577
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,880
What the hell is going on?

1578
01:50:13,159 --> 01:50:14,039
Wait, just wait, wait.

1579
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:14,840
I need to put that on.

1580
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,699
I'll get a conversion here.

1581
01:50:26,489 --> 01:50:34,949
Let's add an insult to injury here.

1582
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:38,619
Yeah, should have made that bet, right?

1583
01:50:40,439 --> 01:50:41,319
I'll try to injure him.

1584
01:50:43,079 --> 01:50:45,000
No, I wanted that tackle.

1585
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,319
Not you.

1586
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,430
Shutout.

1587
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:50,550
Give me the achievement for the shutout.

1588
01:50:58,939 --> 01:50:59,579
That's a fumble.

1589
01:51:02,539 --> 01:51:04,619
I just like spinning wheelhouse kicked him.

1590
01:51:09,819 --> 01:51:12,380
Can I do a 40-point shutout or 38-point shutout?

1591
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:19,460
Oh, my God.

1592
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:34,390
I got it.

1593
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:35,029
Across the clean.

1594
01:51:35,909 --> 01:51:38,659
Let's go for a...

1595
01:51:39,939 --> 01:51:43,210
I'm going to try to get the guy in the middle right.

1596
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:43,930
He's going to turn around.

1597
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:50,180
That square is going to turn around right now.

1598
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:52,020
You dickhead game.

1599
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:53,859
No, I'm not going to 36 points.

1600
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,170
Pain, pain, pain.

1601
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:09,289
Make him hurt.

1602
01:52:10,489 --> 01:52:10,970
Light hit.

1603
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:11,369
Get it.

1604
01:52:11,369 --> 01:52:12,010
Step on his head.

1605
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:18,810
Now I can actually do an injury here.

1606
01:52:20,409 --> 01:52:20,970
New link.

1607
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,500
It's going by too fast.

1608
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:29,369
Oh, my God.

1609
01:52:31,899 --> 01:52:33,739
The offense looking at first and 30.

1610
01:52:33,739 --> 01:52:34,460
What the fuck are these?

1611
01:52:56,199 --> 01:52:57,880
97% accuracy.

1612
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:58,199
Really?

1613
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,729
I have another one.

1614
01:53:01,369 --> 01:53:04,300
I want to go for the quarterback, though.

1615
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:05,979
I don't even care about the play.

1616
01:53:05,979 --> 01:53:06,939
I want to hurt the quarterback.

1617
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:22,630
He's not injured, though.

1618
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:24,869
The quarterback is the paint.

1619
01:53:24,869 --> 01:53:26,710
And the paint was all over the canvas.

1620
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:29,029
I mean, it's like the paint all over the entire paint canvas.

1621
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,909
And the receiver gets taken out before the ball gets near him.

1622
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:35,430
I don't think he knows what hit him.

1623
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:36,630
Let's stop him right here, right here.

1624
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:37,590
Let's do it again.

1625
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:38,390
Oh, he's coming back in.

1626
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,510
It's all right.

1627
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:40,069
Good?

1628
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:40,550
You good to go?

1629
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,590
Go get him.

1630
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:43,859
Is the announcer drunk?

1631
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:46,579
No, the announcer is doing a John Madden impersonation.

1632
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:50,739
John Madden was unknown at...

1633
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:51,460
side.

1634
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:53,220
Okay.

1635
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:53,539
Okay.

1636
01:53:57,699 --> 01:53:58,260
I can't.

1637
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:58,739
Damn it.

1638
01:53:58,739 --> 01:53:59,859
No fucking shut up.

1639
01:54:00,739 --> 01:54:16,220
Give me the penalty.

1640
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:16,699
I don't even care.

1641
01:54:16,699 --> 01:54:17,500
I'm fucking hurting someone.

1642
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:19,420
I can't go across.

1643
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,539
They're doing an onside kick, aren't they?

1644
01:54:28,699 --> 01:54:29,500
Nothing matters.

1645
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:32,949
It doesn't matter anyway.

1646
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,859
Yeah, it's Frank Caliendo.

1647
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,779
He was on Mad TV.

1648
01:54:44,439 --> 01:54:45,800
First down and 30.

1649
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:50,199
And he did a perfect one-to-one John Madden impression.

1650
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:51,720
It was pretty ridiculous.

1651
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:53,960
What was that pass?

1652
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:55,720
What did...

1653
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,840
Is there a replay feature?

1654
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,539
What the hell was this?

1655
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1656
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:28,039
Go back.

1657
01:55:28,039 --> 01:55:30,920
I underhanded that ball like 45 yards.

1658
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,479
50 yards.

1659
01:55:33,079 --> 01:55:33,579
Okay.

1660
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,119
Bowling ball that...

1661
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:37,239
What are we doing for?

1662
01:55:37,239 --> 01:55:38,039
How about manning?

1663
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:38,439
No.

1664
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:39,159
Razzle go.

1665
01:55:46,329 --> 01:55:46,970
Into the end zone.

1666
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:50,489
It's all right.

1667
01:55:50,489 --> 01:55:50,989
Game over.

1668
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,180
Should have bet the money.

1669
01:55:56,140 --> 01:56:02,699
It's the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl tied at three.

1670
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,310
That's going to be a lot of money.

1671
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:11,779
Turnovers caused touchdowns.

1672
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,659
Wager $1,000 to $256,000.

1673
01:56:16,579 --> 01:56:17,460
That's pretty damn good.

1674
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:29,399
New link.

1675
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:38,970
During the cutscene, I'm going to get these saved.

1676
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:39,850
We'll put them on screen.

1677
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:44,310
Have a seat.

1678
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:48,199
Just have a seat.

1679
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:48,920
What's this about?

1680
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:57,060
You're going to go play with that new hotshot, Franchise.

1681
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,539
Why the fuck would I want to play there?

1682
01:56:59,539 --> 01:57:01,140
His team's in division three.

1683
01:57:01,859 --> 01:57:05,699
Because I happen to know that the nightmare is going to cut you at the end of this season.

1684
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:06,579
Let's put them up here.

1685
01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:08,659
Along with that big contract of yours.

1686
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:12,100
That's why they traded up to draft Max Carson.

1687
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:14,260
Oh man, fuck them.

1688
01:57:16,069 --> 01:57:21,029
You might get picked up by another team for a fraction of your current salary.

1689
01:57:22,149 --> 01:57:24,310
Or you can go play with Franchise.

1690
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,430
They keep your deal as is.

1691
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:34,789
Just tell me one thing.

1692
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:36,550
What's in it for you?

1693
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:54,170
There's too many of these.

1694
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,560
There are too many of them.

1695
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:07,300
Okay, I swear to God.

1696
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,020
I'm not kidding.

1697
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:08,340
I don't know.

1698
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,619
Call me like a weirdo if you want.

1699
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:14,899
But I feel like I look in the mirror and this is what I look like sometimes.

1700
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:24,869
I'll take a selfie with an iPhone and this is what the image will be.

1701
01:58:24,869 --> 01:58:25,909
I swear.

1702
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,319
All right, it's Kim.

1703
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:43,460
Wow, what a football.

1704
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:46,260
You and I need to get together this evening and discuss our options.

1705
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,619
It's the front-facing camera.

1706
01:58:47,619 --> 01:58:50,180
You'll find me a flexible negotiator.

1707
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:51,770
Okay.

1708
01:58:52,779 --> 01:58:54,539
You and I need to get together this evening.

1709
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,020
It's time to go on a date.

1710
01:58:57,739 --> 01:58:58,659
Apparently.

1711
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:03,670
Darling, you dressed to kill.

1712
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:05,989
Have time to talk a little business?

1713
01:59:05,989 --> 01:59:07,510
Whatever you like, beautiful.

1714
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:12,949
We have the opportunity to land the biggest sporting goods company in North America.

1715
01:59:12,949 --> 01:59:15,350
And you need me to do a little meet and greet.

1716
01:59:15,909 --> 01:59:18,149
Their reps will be at the game this Sunday.

1717
01:59:18,149 --> 01:59:21,989
I need you to give me a top-notch performance.

1718
01:59:21,989 --> 01:59:23,909
That's the only kind I ever give.

1719
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:26,710
Get it done on the field, hotshot.

1720
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:29,350
And perhaps we can celebrate afterwards.

1721
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:38,460
That one's not even.

1722
01:59:39,609 --> 01:59:41,050
This one is not even.

1723
01:59:42,979 --> 01:59:46,260
You didn't even try to change it to the other photo.

1724
01:59:47,979 --> 01:59:49,500
You just mutated my face.

1725
01:59:57,079 --> 01:59:58,279
Okay, this one is the agent.

1726
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,439
This one's the agent too.

1727
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:01,239
You're getting a little weird.

1728
02:00:04,170 --> 02:00:16,819
And this one is just slowly turning into a gnome.

1729
02:00:16,819 --> 02:00:17,619
All right, roster.

1730
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:20,699
I think there's some changes here.

1731
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:23,720
I got a new player, right?

1732
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:32,949
All right, I got offense, quarterback.

1733
02:00:32,949 --> 02:00:33,829
I'm a C plus.

1734
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,460
Defense, defense.

1735
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:38,539
Anybody like, do I have any Ds?

1736
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:39,340
All right, I don't know.

1737
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:40,779
You might have, you guys might have to go here.

1738
02:00:43,029 --> 02:00:43,590
D plus.

1739
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:55,319
They're all Cs and Ds.

1740
02:00:56,729 --> 02:00:57,770
Lifestyle.

1741
02:00:57,770 --> 02:00:58,649
Sponsors again.

1742
02:00:59,909 --> 02:01:00,630
Protector.

1743
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:02,390
Crunch pads plus two tackle.

1744
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:05,750
Crunch pads help defenders pack a little extra punch in their hits.

1745
02:01:06,710 --> 02:01:06,949
Cool.

1746
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:10,390
Oh, let's see.

1747
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:10,869
Trainer.

1748
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:11,989
Training.

1749
02:01:13,399 --> 02:01:15,079
Assign the training automatically.

1750
02:01:15,079 --> 02:01:15,640
Upgrades.

1751
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,680
More tackle.

1752
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,720
255 grand.

1753
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:23,619
Yep.

1754
02:01:23,619 --> 02:01:24,899
I want to be unstoppable.

1755
02:01:24,899 --> 02:01:25,699
What is going on?

1756
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:07,689
Okay, I'm standing looking into a pond in a dramatic part of the movie,

1757
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:12,710
and somebody dropped a pebble right in the middle of my face in the water.

1758
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:25,579
That's fucking ridiculous.

1759
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:26,619
All right, tackle.

1760
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:27,260
Two tackle.

1761
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,229
I need some, okay, better hands.

1762
02:02:31,029 --> 02:02:32,739
No, I don't have enough money.

1763
02:02:32,739 --> 02:02:33,939
Do I have enough money for anything else?

1764
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:37,800
Ice bath.

1765
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:38,840
Get rid of all the swelling.

1766
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,520
You still have to be careful of shrinkage.

1767
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,630
Oh, that's funny.

1768
02:02:47,479 --> 02:02:48,840
I've seen the fireman.

1769
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,359
Oh, we got old boomer hands.

1770
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:55,060
No, I'm gonna hold the money.

1771
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:56,180
Let's take some more drugs.

1772
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:03,210
For me, I like this turbo bar drain.

1773
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:03,609
Slower.

1774
02:03:03,609 --> 02:03:05,210
Reduce the chance of severity of injuries.

1775
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:11,770
Game plus two stamina for every successful clash or unleash move.

1776
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:13,029
Yeah.

1777
02:03:17,109 --> 02:03:22,359
And let's have the halfback.

1778
02:03:22,359 --> 02:03:28,229
Clash drains for the halfback.

1779
02:03:28,229 --> 02:03:29,029
Yeah, I think so.

1780
02:03:29,029 --> 02:03:30,470
All right, easy with the drug risk.

1781
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:37,260
I gotta do halfback plays here.

1782
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:41,579
All right, any, what's this one?

1783
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,000
I just got gnomed.

1784
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:51,020
Well, there are a million images in the,

1785
02:03:52,060 --> 02:04:00,779
but that's what happens when people are just putting in links.

1786
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,060
All right, let's go.

1787
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:06,500
Las Vegas must win by more than 17 points.

1788
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,100
I need better stats than this.

1789
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:09,699
Train already.

1790
02:04:15,909 --> 02:04:16,949
Fourth quarter.

1791
02:04:16,949 --> 02:04:18,069
What a boring Super Bowl.

1792
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:19,670
Oh, Patriots scored.

1793
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:22,699
I was gonna say what a boring Super Bowl.

1794
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:24,060
Three to three for the whole game.

1795
02:04:26,819 --> 02:04:27,859
Patriots up 10-3.

1796
02:04:28,819 --> 02:04:30,260
Seven minutes remaining in the last quarter.

1797
02:04:30,819 --> 02:04:35,779
I mean, Tom Bladey really is just so unbelievable.

1798
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:38,060
5,000.

1799
02:04:42,329 --> 02:04:45,210
The Houston rioters have been the Division 3 punching bag

1800
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:47,130
since they joined the league three years ago.

1801
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:51,399
That might be changing this year

1802
02:04:51,399 --> 02:04:53,640
since they drafted running back Don L. Sullivan

1803
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,439
in the first round.

1804
02:04:54,439 --> 02:04:54,920
Running back.

1805
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:56,199
That's the target.

1806
02:04:56,199 --> 02:04:58,119
The guy's got an effective one-two punch.

1807
02:04:58,119 --> 02:05:01,000
His wicked first to speed followed by his stiff arm jab.

1808
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:03,560
And he ain't afraid to hit below the belt.

1809
02:05:04,119 --> 02:05:05,960
So if we want to shut down Houston,

1810
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:07,640
we need to knock out Sullivan.

1811
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:12,619
Time to kill this guy.

1812
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:20,619
Who is this in real life?

1813
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:22,380
It's all fictional.

1814
02:05:23,609 --> 02:05:24,090
No, people.

1815
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:26,890
There are no real people in the game, I don't believe.

1816
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:30,010
This is not a licensed NFL video game.

1817
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,380
Pro, they got a strong running game.

1818
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:36,789
But their con is their speed.

1819
02:05:36,789 --> 02:05:37,670
How does that make any sense?

1820
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:41,109
How can you have a slow, strong running team?

1821
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:42,069
Good evening, everyone.

1822
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:54,170
It begins.

1823
02:05:54,170 --> 02:05:59,800
It's a dirty hit right off the bat.

1824
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:01,159
And I can, let's go.

1825
02:06:01,159 --> 02:06:02,039
What's the name of the drink?

1826
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:09,750
All right, I got two blips so far.

1827
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:11,510
Good breath back.

1828
02:06:13,029 --> 02:06:14,550
So we're going to stop the running game.

1829
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:24,380
First down and 30.

1830
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:27,210
Stop him.

1831
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:27,770
Stop him.

1832
02:06:28,729 --> 02:06:29,529
Oh, that's him.

1833
02:06:29,529 --> 02:06:30,970
Any other questions this guy's leadership

1834
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:32,729
may can just look to a play like that.

1835
02:06:33,529 --> 02:06:38,819
All right, I got to take him out.

1836
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:43,979
I'm going to say crush.

1837
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:47,609
There he is.

1838
02:06:47,609 --> 02:06:48,170
I see you.

1839
02:06:50,899 --> 02:06:55,079
You see that?

1840
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:56,199
That was me.

1841
02:06:56,199 --> 02:06:57,560
That's called me waiting for you.

1842
02:06:58,199 --> 02:07:00,890
And now I got a meter.

1843
02:07:05,609 --> 02:07:06,010
Same deal.

1844
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:06,890
You want to go for the same guy?

1845
02:07:07,689 --> 02:07:09,130
Go for it.

1846
02:07:09,689 --> 02:07:14,979
Oh, I had an opportunity.

1847
02:07:15,699 --> 02:07:17,060
He didn't make it through though.

1848
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:18,630
Let's forward down.

1849
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:19,270
They're going to punt it.

1850
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:26,170
Where are the refs?

1851
02:07:28,619 --> 02:07:29,739
Yeah, where are the refs?

1852
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,539
Why would you do that?

1853
02:07:33,539 --> 02:07:36,899
I have punt return and oh, God.

1854
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,420
Keeps his feet moving.

1855
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:51,300
You guys are fucking kidding me.

1856
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:51,619
All right.

1857
02:07:51,619 --> 02:07:52,340
Now we taunt.

1858
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:00,180
Dream of as a special teams player.

1859
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,300
That was really, really good.

1860
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,420
Went right during that return.

1861
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:06,659
A punt punt returned from the end zone

1862
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:10,260
that the guy didn't catch to run back for a touchdown.

1863
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:12,489
Welcome to hell.

1864
02:08:15,699 --> 02:08:20,800
Catch it.

1865
02:08:23,739 --> 02:08:24,239
I got it.

1866
02:08:27,779 --> 02:08:28,260
I got it.

1867
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:28,979
I actually got it.

1868
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:45,859
I still have a full meter to new image.

1869
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:51,189
Watch the guy in the bottom right.

1870
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,689
Twenty eight.

1871
02:08:53,029 --> 02:08:53,750
That's the captain.

1872
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,100
I am not going to select anybody else

1873
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,460
because if he gets through it's a touchdown.

1874
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:03,260
So I'm staying back.

1875
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:06,859
Is it actually cursed image in chat right now?

1876
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:07,180
I can't.

1877
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:08,060
That's going to make the throw up.

1878
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:08,779
I can't look at that.

1879
02:09:08,779 --> 02:09:10,380
I actually just hurt my head looking at that.

1880
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:14,140
That's all I see now.

1881
02:09:14,699 --> 02:09:15,579
I don't see anything else.

1882
02:09:23,319 --> 02:09:23,880
Third down.

1883
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:25,779
Let's do the flip.

1884
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:27,960
Twenty eight right there.

1885
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:28,840
They're going to twenty eight.

1886
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,560
I'm going to crush him.

1887
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,359
Ravity goes up the middle.

1888
02:09:32,579 --> 02:09:33,300
No.

1889
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:33,939
Quarter ran out.

1890
02:09:34,899 --> 02:09:38,979
And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by eight.

1891
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:39,300
Yeah.

1892
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,180
Watch that picture.

1893
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:42,899
Be easy on that picture.

1894
02:09:42,899 --> 02:09:45,380
If you have you're sensitive to light rays

1895
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:47,060
and sensitive to wacky images.

1896
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,460
I advise you not to click it

1897
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:51,859
because I just got like a headache for five seconds.

1898
02:09:54,250 --> 02:10:00,939
Fourth down.

1899
02:10:12,539 --> 02:10:13,020
Same deal.

1900
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:14,380
Oh fuck.

1901
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:15,180
They're punting.

1902
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:15,420
Shit.

1903
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:16,060
Somebody catch it.

1904
02:10:16,939 --> 02:10:19,210
I always figure they're not going to do it.

1905
02:10:24,619 --> 02:10:27,430
All right.

1906
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:28,390
There's an opportunity here.

1907
02:10:31,109 --> 02:10:32,630
Couldn't couldn't plow through it.

1908
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:33,750
He's got better stats than I do.

1909
02:10:39,939 --> 02:10:40,500
Let's go.

1910
02:10:41,619 --> 02:10:42,789
Let's go straight up.

1911
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:56,260
I might try to do a big no no no let's run it run it.

1912
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:04,939
Crush.

1913
02:11:05,579 --> 02:11:06,619
Halfback crush.

1914
02:11:06,619 --> 02:11:07,579
I have the drug.

1915
02:11:07,579 --> 02:11:08,619
My halfback is on drugs.

1916
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:15,619
Can't plow through that even with drugs.

1917
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:16,260
That sucks.

1918
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:17,859
Do it again.

1919
02:11:17,859 --> 02:11:19,699
I like their chances here on third and short.

1920
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:23,750
Damn it.

1921
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:26,630
I promise you he's gonna feel that one tomorrow.

1922
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:27,750
Shit he actually got through.

1923
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:33,750
Fuck it.

1924
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:34,310
I'm going for it.

1925
02:11:36,579 --> 02:11:44,359
Franchise gives his team a new set of downs.

1926
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:46,439
Fake punt.

1927
02:11:46,439 --> 02:11:47,399
No I'm just going right.

1928
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:48,520
I just have to get the first down.

1929
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,239
That's all I care about.

1930
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:52,779
Now I have to be very careful.

1931
02:11:53,579 --> 02:11:55,000
I gotta get a touchdown right here.

1932
02:11:58,949 --> 02:11:59,989
He lets it fly.

1933
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:03,800
The ball gets there too late.

1934
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:05,640
Or should I say the defender got there.

1935
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,239
Oh I just got clotheslined.

1936
02:12:07,239 --> 02:12:07,560
Shit.

1937
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:15,539
Second I gotta get this now.

1938
02:12:16,579 --> 02:12:25,529
Houston comes up with the turnover.

1939
02:12:25,529 --> 02:12:27,850
Sorry here comes this is they got one play.

1940
02:12:29,319 --> 02:12:31,960
At least he blew his uh unleash.

1941
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,100
They got one play.

1942
02:12:35,079 --> 02:12:36,359
I'm staying all the way back.

1943
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,520
I ain't gonna let somebody just get across here.

1944
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:45,779
The first half of the books.

1945
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:47,939
Las Vegas leads by eight.

1946
02:12:47,939 --> 02:12:48,659
Four minutes.

1947
02:12:49,779 --> 02:12:51,939
In the Super Bowl Patriots up 10-3.

1948
02:12:52,979 --> 02:12:57,180
He's actually playing safety.

1949
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,420
Yeah um yeah sometimes you have to play the game where you're supposed to.

1950
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:05,960
These dirty hits.

1951
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:21,539
First and 30.

1952
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,579
Oh I can't look at that right.

1953
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:25,460
Wait.

1954
02:13:30,119 --> 02:13:33,560
Hey hey hey Herbert thanks for the five community subs.

1955
02:13:34,359 --> 02:13:36,420
The links.

1956
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:39,239
Thank you for the community subs Herbert.

1957
02:13:43,819 --> 02:13:45,420
Oh well there's too many people coming at me.

1958
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:59,029
Got the first down.

1959
02:14:02,729 --> 02:14:03,850
All right we're kind of at the.

1960
02:14:03,850 --> 02:14:04,649
Let's do a goal line here.

1961
02:14:04,649 --> 02:14:05,289
First and goal.

1962
02:14:05,289 --> 02:14:07,130
This is not I mean it is goal.

1963
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:11,510
Cut out to the left.

1964
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,989
There it is.

1965
02:14:11,989 --> 02:14:12,470
There it is.

1966
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:17,050
These guys are very the defense is very good.

1967
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:17,850
It's hard to break through.

1968
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:19,210
Second down down.

1969
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:23,260
Hey uh what we got him at the team breakfast this morning.

1970
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:31,500
Get in there.

1971
02:14:32,859 --> 02:14:33,500
I got an unleash.

1972
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:36,060
Las Vegas gives themselves some more breathing room with that score.

1973
02:14:37,979 --> 02:14:41,819
No let's just be smart because they still have their star player.

1974
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:49,140
The extra point is good.

1975
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:52,970
First and 10 at New England 4.

1976
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:01,300
I'm getting live updates here.

1977
02:15:01,939 --> 02:15:06,279
All right somebody just said.

1978
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:07,880
Break.

1979
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:08,359
Come on.

1980
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:08,840
Injury.

1981
02:15:12,199 --> 02:15:12,699
Yeah.

1982
02:15:18,979 --> 02:15:21,460
Somebody just said who would ever move to Las Vegas.

1983
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,819
It's a fucking wasteland.

1984
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:36,220
Well hey Vegas is great.

1985
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:36,859
What are you talking about.

1986
02:15:37,579 --> 02:15:43,210
That was another touchdown by the way.

1987
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:45,930
Those are paying attention.

1988
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:51,189
Nobody has made or anything.

1989
02:15:51,189 --> 02:15:54,779
So it's a couple of late hits.

1990
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:55,420
Step on the helmet.

1991
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:05,800
Why would you move to Vegas.

1992
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:07,720
Why would you move anywhere.

1993
02:16:10,439 --> 02:16:12,500
Why did I just get that.

1994
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:17,020
You can get a chance to move.

1995
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:24,470
And you're angry.

1996
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,670
He's they can tell I'm angry.

1997
02:16:26,949 --> 02:16:28,069
That back here it is.

1998
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:31,670
Got it.

1999
02:16:31,670 --> 02:16:32,069
Thank God.

2000
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:33,430
I don't know.

2001
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:33,909
Thank God.

2002
02:16:33,909 --> 02:16:35,110
I don't know by law.

2003
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:37,190
As we reach the end of the third quarter.

2004
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:39,190
Las Vegas leads by 21.

2005
02:16:41,159 --> 02:16:41,719
That's this.

2006
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:47,860
By the way t-shirts are available.

2007
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:51,940
If you want a German 985 officially licensed t-shirt.

2008
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:53,219
They are.

2009
02:16:53,219 --> 02:16:54,420
There's a new t-shirt store.

2010
02:16:55,219 --> 02:16:56,819
It's on taste frame.

2011
02:16:56,819 --> 02:16:59,379
Go ahead and if you want it is the night sky is now available.

2012
02:16:59,379 --> 02:17:11,219
And blue man is back.

2013
02:17:11,219 --> 02:17:12,979
Please include that image on a shirt.

2014
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:15,879
That's no.

2015
02:17:15,879 --> 02:17:17,159
I don't want to put that on.

2016
02:17:17,159 --> 02:17:17,399
Why.

2017
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:25,940
Stop him at the 29 yard line.

2018
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:27,620
I hope you enjoyed your popcorn folks.

2019
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:29,299
Because you just saw quite a show.

2020
02:17:29,299 --> 02:17:30,100
What a run.

2021
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:30,659
Let's get here.

2022
02:17:30,659 --> 02:17:32,340
Crucial series of downs here.

2023
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:34,260
Ball spotted the 29 yard line.

2024
02:17:38,899 --> 02:17:39,940
Holy shit.

2025
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:40,979
They're going to get a touchdown.

2026
02:17:40,979 --> 02:17:42,100
That was wild.

2027
02:17:47,219 --> 02:17:58,680
I know.

2028
02:17:58,680 --> 02:17:59,559
I have to kill that guy.

2029
02:17:59,559 --> 02:18:00,600
But it's easier said than done.

2030
02:18:01,399 --> 02:18:06,520
I almost blocked it.

2031
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,180
The extra point is good.

2032
02:18:08,979 --> 02:18:12,139
And he got.

2033
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:15,420
And it looks like they'll try it on sidekick.

2034
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:17,579
They got to get two more full possessions.

2035
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:24,940
They're not going to get two full possessions.

2036
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:25,579
In a minute.

2037
02:18:27,299 --> 02:18:28,739
Damn that was a hit.

2038
02:18:29,459 --> 02:18:31,459
I don't see any new kids in his future.

2039
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:32,739
Oh what.

2040
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:34,340
Flush inside.

2041
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:34,979
I'm going to go for a run.

2042
02:18:34,979 --> 02:18:35,940
First down and 30.

2043
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:41,020
Damn it.

2044
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:44,629
Who was that?

2045
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:49,000
Robbie.

2046
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:03,049
No not Robbie.

2047
02:19:03,049 --> 02:19:04,170
Anybody but Robbie.

2048
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:08,629
Listen this isn't working.

2049
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:11,350
Let's go with.

2050
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:11,909
What else have you got?

2051
02:19:11,909 --> 02:19:12,149
Let's go with mom.

2052
02:19:12,149 --> 02:19:13,989
Second down and about a mile.

2053
02:19:13,989 --> 02:19:14,790
They don't have any meter.

2054
02:19:19,739 --> 02:19:21,180
Looking for the big play.

2055
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:21,659
Got it.

2056
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:23,420
Oh there it is.

2057
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:30,940
Now it's out of reach.

2058
02:19:31,579 --> 02:19:33,340
Pretty much completely.

2059
02:19:33,979 --> 02:19:35,700
Let's go with a little dog shit pass.

2060
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:43,420
Right here.

2061
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:43,819
Right here.

2062
02:19:43,819 --> 02:19:44,139
Right here.

2063
02:19:44,139 --> 02:19:44,540
Right here.

2064
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:47,559
The conversion is good.

2065
02:19:47,559 --> 02:19:48,360
29.7.

2066
02:19:52,649 --> 02:19:53,370
What's the colors?

2067
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:54,489
The colors are supposed to be.

2068
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:59,340
The German 985 Twitch YouTuber colors.

2069
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:03,579
They don't really look that good on.

2070
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:08,180
They look like it's an ice cream cone.

2071
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:08,819
But that's okay.

2072
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:11,219
Right into my guy.

2073
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:18,090
They don't look good on anything.

2074
02:20:18,809 --> 02:20:21,209
Well it looks good on a digital screen.

2075
02:20:21,209 --> 02:20:22,170
As like a character.

2076
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:26,739
Oh god damn it.

2077
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:29,850
Oh nice juke.

2078
02:20:31,299 --> 02:20:34,180
Houston exploits an opening in the defense for some real yardage.

2079
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:35,860
All right this is my opportunity here.

2080
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:38,180
It's time to crush.

2081
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:38,899
First down.

2082
02:20:38,899 --> 02:20:39,379
30 yards to go.

2083
02:20:39,379 --> 02:20:40,500
I have an unleash.

2084
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,100
I'm going to try to hurt somebody here.

2085
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:42,739
Let's go.

2086
02:20:42,739 --> 02:20:44,260
They're going to go to the running back here.

2087
02:20:47,219 --> 02:20:50,649
You stopped my unleash.

2088
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:53,290
How would you stop my unleash?

2089
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:54,250
I was holding L2.

2090
02:20:54,250 --> 02:20:55,450
He stopped my unleash.

2091
02:20:59,659 --> 02:20:59,979
How?

2092
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,340
He stopped it.

2093
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,319
Don't matter.

2094
02:21:13,319 --> 02:21:16,040
It's legitimately impossible for them to get in this game.

2095
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:17,579
It's impossible.

2096
02:21:18,379 --> 02:21:22,469
Stop my unleash.

2097
02:21:22,469 --> 02:21:24,059
You got to be kidding me.

2098
02:21:24,059 --> 02:21:26,139
We can try to.

2099
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:28,979
There you go.

2100
02:21:28,979 --> 02:21:30,020
You're all right buddy.

2101
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:31,219
All right Robbie get back in here.

2102
02:21:34,459 --> 02:21:39,180
Goes way down field.

2103
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:41,420
And it's caught at the 15 yard line.

2104
02:21:42,459 --> 02:21:44,250
He turns on a dime.

2105
02:21:45,049 --> 02:21:45,850
Full line.

2106
02:21:45,850 --> 02:21:46,649
Touchdown.

2107
02:21:46,649 --> 02:21:47,690
Las Vegas.

2108
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:48,889
Okay I'm trying to get a random code.

2109
02:21:48,889 --> 02:21:49,209
20.

2110
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:53,190
Yeah Robbie comes in the game.

2111
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:53,989
Let me see what happens.

2112
02:21:53,989 --> 02:21:55,030
Get out there and start.

2113
02:22:05,819 --> 02:22:06,459
It's no good.

2114
02:22:07,659 --> 02:22:08,540
It's okay.

2115
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:19,350
It's 30 seconds in the game.

2116
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:21,500
There's no way they're going to have this.

2117
02:22:22,459 --> 02:22:30,809
They might get one more touchdown.

2118
02:22:30,809 --> 02:22:31,129
Maybe.

2119
02:22:31,930 --> 02:22:33,530
They still get that guy in the game.

2120
02:22:33,530 --> 02:22:36,649
So I'm going to hang back.

2121
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:47,610
Oh you got to hold on to that.

2122
02:22:48,489 --> 02:22:53,209
Quick kill someone before it ends.

2123
02:22:53,209 --> 02:22:54,809
I might not be able to.

2124
02:22:54,809 --> 02:23:07,299
Let's go for a chaos run.

2125
02:23:19,819 --> 02:23:20,940
Patriots win Super Bowl.

2126
02:23:21,659 --> 02:23:21,979
Did they?

2127
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:25,379
Like there's still like a minute left right?

2128
02:23:31,139 --> 02:23:32,659
No he used his unleashed.

2129
02:23:33,379 --> 02:23:35,620
I'm gonna get it.

2130
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:36,100
Game over.

2131
02:23:36,979 --> 02:23:40,340
And as time expires Las Vegas will take this one.

2132
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:47,739
Beat Houston.

2133
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:52,010
Two minute warning for the Super Bowl.

2134
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:58,409
What a party.

2135
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,360
No injuries unfortunately.

2136
02:24:03,399 --> 02:24:05,579
A lot of touchdowns.

2137
02:24:05,579 --> 02:24:08,520
They did get the wager right?

2138
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,719
Because it was 17 points right?

2139
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:13,290
Concept art.

2140
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:18,229
Who am I rooting for in the Super Bowl?

2141
02:24:19,829 --> 02:24:24,059
I mean I'm from Massachusetts.

2142
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:25,979
I lived there for 30 years.

2143
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:30,280
So the Patriots probably.

2144
02:24:31,079 --> 02:24:32,870
If I were to have to sell you.

2145
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:35,659
Is this?

2146
02:24:35,659 --> 02:24:36,459
Hey yourself.

2147
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:45,979
Quick cut the stream.

2148
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:49,139
How we doing on training?

2149
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:50,340
Stats.

2150
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,059
Power rankings.

2151
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:53,860
League standings.

2152
02:24:54,899 --> 02:24:55,989
Girlfriends.

2153
02:24:59,139 --> 02:25:01,620
Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.

2154
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:02,899
Marketing professional who specializes

2155
02:25:02,899 --> 02:25:04,020
in getting superstar athletes together

2156
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:05,219
with top sports brands.

2157
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:09,209
Did I get any new sponsors?

2158
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:10,969
No new sponsors.

2159
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:16,149
Training.

2160
02:25:16,149 --> 02:25:16,629
Upgrades.

2161
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:20,899
I don't have enough.

2162
02:25:22,059 --> 02:25:22,940
What do I need?

2163
02:25:23,899 --> 02:25:24,780
I need better hands.

2164
02:25:26,069 --> 02:25:27,030
No more fumbles.

2165
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:31,319
Or strength.

2166
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:35,399
I'm going to say hands.

2167
02:25:37,459 --> 02:25:39,059
Hands and strength.

2168
02:25:39,059 --> 02:25:39,620
I got one.

2169
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:40,819
Yeah I got enough.

2170
02:25:43,829 --> 02:25:45,510
It's just hand moisturizer.

2171
02:25:46,549 --> 02:25:47,430
Maybe speed too.

2172
02:25:48,309 --> 02:25:49,590
No I'll do strength.

2173
02:25:54,809 --> 02:25:55,690
All right.

2174
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:57,129
Because my training is doing good.

2175
02:25:59,659 --> 02:26:00,780
Assigned training automatically.

2176
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:07,459
So what do we got here?

2177
02:26:07,459 --> 02:26:08,819
I got two more games to advance.

2178
02:26:09,620 --> 02:26:10,659
Three and all right now.

2179
02:26:10,659 --> 02:26:12,659
Forty two thousand dollars in the bank.

2180
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:20,950
And let's see where we're at now.

2181
02:26:22,579 --> 02:26:24,739
I have gained stats.

2182
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:27,700
Our overall is two notches.

2183
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:29,860
I went up in defense.

2184
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,239
How do you spend a hundred grand

2185
02:26:33,239 --> 02:26:34,280
on hand moisturizer?

2186
02:26:35,899 --> 02:26:37,659
Win by more than 20 points.

2187
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:42,469
I've done it two games in a row.

2188
02:26:42,469 --> 02:26:43,670
But that's a lot of money to bet.

2189
02:26:44,229 --> 02:26:44,729
Fuck it.

2190
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:47,049
The Milwaukee Hounds used to be

2191
02:26:47,049 --> 02:26:48,809
a bunch of semi-pro misfits.

2192
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:51,450
But quarterback Conrad Damon

2193
02:26:51,450 --> 02:26:53,129
has made them the high caliber team

2194
02:26:53,129 --> 02:26:54,649
to beat in division three.

2195
02:26:54,649 --> 02:26:56,170
Not bad for a guy who drives

2196
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,690
a military assault vehicle.

2197
02:26:57,690 --> 02:26:58,889
He just ruined the whole field.

2198
02:26:58,889 --> 02:27:00,170
Conrad's got a cannon for an arm.

2199
02:27:00,170 --> 02:27:01,930
And a damn good receiver call.

2200
02:27:02,569 --> 02:27:03,930
Make no mistake.

2201
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:05,930
This guy's a deadly bastard.

2202
02:27:05,930 --> 02:27:07,770
So hit him hard and hit him off.

2203
02:27:09,129 --> 02:27:09,850
All right.

2204
02:27:09,850 --> 02:27:10,250
Okay.

2205
02:27:10,889 --> 02:27:11,610
Easy there.

2206
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:12,809
Guy.

2207
02:27:14,729 --> 02:27:15,049
What?

2208
02:27:30,579 --> 02:27:33,139
What is this shitty twisted metal reject?

2209
02:27:36,219 --> 02:27:37,020
We have to get rid of him.

2210
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:38,299
Look at how long his body is.

2211
02:27:39,299 --> 02:27:41,219
He has an exceptionally long body.

2212
02:27:43,129 --> 02:27:44,170
Good evening, everyone.

2213
02:27:49,430 --> 02:27:50,389
So ugly.

2214
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,870
Every time.

2215
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:51,750
All right.

2216
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:52,790
We got to go up to the quarterback.

2217
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,569
That's the target.

2218
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:04,569
And that's a fucking touchdown

2219
02:28:04,569 --> 02:28:05,370
right at the beginning of the game.

2220
02:28:13,559 --> 02:28:15,159
So nobody on their defense

2221
02:28:15,159 --> 02:28:16,600
is particularly terrifying.

2222
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,690
Oh, almost.

2223
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,190
Almost.

2224
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:25,180
Oh!

2225
02:28:27,319 --> 02:28:28,120
That deserves a taunt.

2226
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:29,000
That deserves a taunt.

2227
02:28:29,799 --> 02:28:30,440
How do I taunt?

2228
02:28:38,379 --> 02:28:39,579
That should have been a taunt.

2229
02:28:44,459 --> 02:28:45,260
No, I'm going to go safe.

2230
02:28:47,079 --> 02:28:48,040
Here we go.

2231
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:54,819
Three extra points.

2232
02:28:57,829 --> 02:28:59,030
How's Super Bowl going?

2233
02:28:59,030 --> 02:28:59,750
One minute left.

2234
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:00,469
Patriots have the ball.

2235
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:02,549
4-1 at L.A. 24, really.

2236
02:29:04,729 --> 02:29:06,329
I don't know how up to date that is.

2237
02:29:07,129 --> 02:29:17,209
It is a nice dirty hit.

2238
02:29:22,090 --> 02:29:25,270
That was nice.

2239
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:31,860
So they have an amazing quarterback.

2240
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:34,149
So I got to be aware of that.

2241
02:29:34,149 --> 02:29:34,950
I got to try to injure him.

2242
02:29:35,829 --> 02:29:37,270
I don't want to do that for safety, though.

2243
02:29:38,549 --> 02:29:39,110
Maybe I do.

2244
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:48,299
He's at 86%.

2245
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:50,299
And I have an unleash.

2246
02:30:02,889 --> 02:30:04,250
Field goal for the Patriots.

2247
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:04,750
Okay.

2248
02:30:08,219 --> 02:30:09,340
Caught that right at the very end.

2249
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:12,620
So the Rams have one minute

2250
02:30:13,979 --> 02:30:14,479
to...

2251
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:17,319
It's almost impossible, isn't it?

2252
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:19,750
They're going to have to get a touchdown

2253
02:30:20,790 --> 02:30:22,229
and then an onside kick.

2254
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:27,200
Damn.

2255
02:30:27,579 --> 02:30:29,180
Well, it's not impossible.

2256
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:29,979
It's just improbable.

2257
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:34,059
Ooh, nice interception.

2258
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:39,579
See you later.

2259
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:45,520
Identity.

2260
02:30:51,049 --> 02:30:54,809
Am I rooting for Rams?

2261
02:30:54,809 --> 02:30:56,969
I mean, I'm from New England.

2262
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:59,129
The Patriots are the team

2263
02:30:59,129 --> 02:31:00,329
that I should be rooting for.

2264
02:31:01,959 --> 02:31:04,120
So I don't know.

2265
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:09,209
Yeah, but right in the fucking head.

2266
02:31:16,569 --> 02:31:18,250
Cox chugged all the frames.

2267
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:30,200
Oh, geez.

2268
02:31:35,930 --> 02:31:38,680
I don't know what that was.

2269
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,239
What did I just hurt?

2270
02:31:41,719 --> 02:31:46,440
Broken rib.

2271
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,239
You're up a two plays.

2272
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:51,340
That's it.

2273
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:54,540
See you in like two and a half minutes.

2274
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:01,739
No game.

2275
02:32:01,739 --> 02:32:02,459
Only three yards.

2276
02:32:08,299 --> 02:32:09,420
I just broke a few ribs.

2277
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:09,979
Just get in there.

2278
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:19,850
Oh.

2279
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:24,709
Not only is that illegal,

2280
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:26,389
but that's how you find yourself in a jail cell.

2281
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:32,260
Let's go back to balance.

2282
02:32:32,260 --> 02:32:33,059
He's going to be throwing it.

2283
02:32:33,059 --> 02:32:33,620
All right.

2284
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:34,100
You're all right.

2285
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:35,219
Let me see here.

2286
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:35,700
Good.

2287
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:36,739
You're good to go.

2288
02:32:36,739 --> 02:32:38,469
Go get him.

2289
02:32:38,469 --> 02:32:39,510
Actually illegal.

2290
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:50,379
Oh, no.

2291
02:32:50,379 --> 02:32:51,340
He's still going.

2292
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:52,219
I almost had it too.

2293
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:53,579
He's close.

2294
02:32:54,139 --> 02:32:57,639
Crucial series of downs here.

2295
02:32:58,940 --> 02:32:59,579
Stuff him here.

2296
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:11,959
Stuff him.

2297
02:33:12,889 --> 02:33:13,850
Don't give him a chance.

2298
02:33:14,729 --> 02:33:20,700
Ah, pick up one more.

2299
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,979
That's the end of the first quarter

2300
02:33:21,979 --> 02:33:24,219
as Las Vegas leads by 15.

2301
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:27,100
Tom Brady just grew an extra finger

2302
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:29,420
to put on his sixth spring.

2303
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:34,020
Is it actually over?

2304
02:33:40,569 --> 02:33:41,049
Damn it.

2305
02:33:41,049 --> 02:33:42,170
Ah, what was I trying to do there?

2306
02:33:42,809 --> 02:33:43,309
Sorry.

2307
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:47,239
No, it's not time yet.

2308
02:33:47,799 --> 02:33:48,600
I'm still streaming.

2309
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:51,219
My Super Bowl's not over yet.

2310
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:53,899
What the heck?

2311
02:33:53,899 --> 02:33:57,739
My eight foot sub cater order

2312
02:33:57,739 --> 02:33:58,780
didn't even get here yet.

2313
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:14,760
Holy shit.

2314
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:15,559
You fucked up bad.

2315
02:34:27,049 --> 02:34:28,569
Okay, I don't even want to hear that kind of.

2316
02:34:28,569 --> 02:34:29,530
What the hell are you saying?

2317
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:33,750
The deep pass.

2318
02:34:35,430 --> 02:34:37,750
And it's complete at the seven yard line.

2319
02:34:49,299 --> 02:34:53,540
Hurt him.

2320
02:34:54,469 --> 02:34:55,110
No injury there.

2321
02:34:59,129 --> 02:35:00,409
Oh, the signature.

2322
02:35:00,409 --> 02:35:00,969
Look at me.

2323
02:35:01,770 --> 02:35:20,149
What are we hurting?

2324
02:35:20,149 --> 02:35:20,649
Uh-oh.

2325
02:35:23,219 --> 02:35:23,700
Nope.

2326
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:24,579
I thought it was, uh.

2327
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:31,049
I thought it was something else.

2328
02:35:32,549 --> 02:35:34,790
We still have not seen the worst.

2329
02:35:34,790 --> 02:35:36,629
The offense looking at first and 30.

2330
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:41,690
Which is the defense.

2331
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:45,719
God, he's outbound.

2332
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:50,899
Prevent.

2333
02:35:50,899 --> 02:35:51,379
Prevent.

2334
02:35:51,379 --> 02:35:51,940
Deep zones.

2335
02:35:52,819 --> 02:35:53,860
He passes all the time.

2336
02:35:57,579 --> 02:36:02,969
That's not what I call prevention.

2337
02:36:04,819 --> 02:36:05,860
That's not prevention.

2338
02:36:11,739 --> 02:36:12,379
So that's it.

2339
02:36:12,379 --> 02:36:13,420
Patriots win the Super Bowl.

2340
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:20,459
That's it.

2341
02:36:21,239 --> 02:36:22,440
The New England Patriots

2342
02:36:23,639 --> 02:36:25,000
have won the Super Bowl

2343
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,959
for the tenth time in a row.

2344
02:36:30,329 --> 02:36:31,049
There it is.

2345
02:36:31,770 --> 02:36:32,409
They did it.

2346
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:35,209
I can't believe they did it.

2347
02:36:36,090 --> 02:36:50,840
But, uh.

2348
02:36:54,149 --> 02:36:56,549
Yeah, congratulations to Tom Brady.

2349
02:36:57,510 --> 02:36:58,569
You can now.

2350
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:01,209
Essentially now Tom Brady is the one.

2351
02:37:01,209 --> 02:37:02,809
When Tom Brady eventually like dies.

2352
02:37:03,610 --> 02:37:05,129
Like in, you know, 50 years.

2353
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:08,309
He's won so many Super Bowls.

2354
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:10,950
They're gonna like future Ramaham.

2355
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:16,809
He'll be doing like press conferences still.

2356
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:26,139
Oh, that one hit.

2357
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:27,520
Got it.

2358
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:28,020
Perception.

2359
02:37:28,969 --> 02:37:29,469
Oh.

2360
02:37:31,129 --> 02:37:33,209
He fell down and turned his braid off.

2361
02:37:33,209 --> 02:37:33,709
No.

2362
02:37:34,329 --> 02:37:34,969
No, that was me.

2363
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:41,399
Oh, shit.

2364
02:37:41,399 --> 02:37:41,899
That's bad.

2365
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:46,680
Hen's game of the loss.

2366
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:47,180
That sucks.

2367
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:53,020
It's fucking shaggy.

2368
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:53,579
All right.

2369
02:37:53,579 --> 02:37:54,780
We both have unleashed.

2370
02:37:58,360 --> 02:37:59,239
Eaves it deep.

2371
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:02,760
Out of bounds at the 47 yard line.

2372
02:38:02,760 --> 02:38:03,399
I actually caught it.

2373
02:38:03,399 --> 02:38:03,799
Holy shit.

2374
02:38:03,799 --> 02:38:04,299
Hold on.

2375
02:38:05,159 --> 02:38:07,049
I don't think I caught that.

2376
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:09,209
I think I caught that out of bound.

2377
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:12,639
I can't do like slow motion.

2378
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:16,540
Is one foot?

2379
02:38:17,719 --> 02:38:18,219
Nope.

2380
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:19,579
Whatever.

2381
02:38:19,579 --> 02:38:20,059
It's in my favor.

2382
02:38:20,059 --> 02:38:20,559
I don't care.

2383
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:29,309
Brady now has the final stone for this bump.

2384
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:30,989
Yeah, you guys.

2385
02:38:30,989 --> 02:38:32,190
Everyone should be concerned about this.

2386
02:38:34,350 --> 02:38:41,950
Oh, look at me.

2387
02:38:41,950 --> 02:38:42,450
Look at me.

2388
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:49,180
I thought I was gonna get really hurt.

2389
02:38:50,219 --> 02:38:50,719
Okay.

2390
02:38:54,510 --> 02:38:57,950
Oh, shit.

2391
02:38:58,829 --> 02:39:00,030
Stop pausing.

2392
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:01,069
And so at halftime.

2393
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:03,709
Leads by 16.

2394
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:17,879
Sorry for the YouTuber scream.

2395
02:39:17,879 --> 02:39:18,379
I'm sorry.

2396
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:29,690
He's gone for like the rest of the year.

2397
02:39:31,049 --> 02:39:32,879
It's always the spleen.

2398
02:39:32,879 --> 02:39:33,680
You're gone forever.

2399
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:36,860
See you in eight games the whole season.

2400
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:45,899
That's what you get for making me lose and be stupid and taunt you.

2401
02:39:46,700 --> 02:39:48,379
That's what you get from me taunting you.

2402
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,120
I gotta get in there and get that.

2403
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:57,940
Quarterback.

2404
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,870
I gotta get in there.

2405
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:20,799
He recovered from the concussion.

2406
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:22,670
I almost got it.

2407
02:40:23,389 --> 02:40:25,850
We'll do spy man.

2408
02:40:27,770 --> 02:40:28,809
One more good dirty hit.

2409
02:40:29,709 --> 02:40:30,909
And I'll have enough to try to take up.

2410
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:34,750
What?

2411
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:42,780
My guy just stopped moving.

2412
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,739
Oh, fuck the button.

2413
02:40:44,379 --> 02:41:02,799
Oh, stay up.

2414
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:03,299
Stay up.

2415
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:11,280
Uh, what about the sling?

2416
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:12,079
Let's go with the sling.

2417
02:41:13,819 --> 02:41:15,819
I don't, I'm not going to use my own leads here.

2418
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:19,680
Give me a cut.

2419
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:20,180
Give me a cut.

2420
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:21,700
There he is.

2421
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:35,180
Let's go for a bolt.

2422
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:35,680
Bolt pass.

2423
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:37,120
Cut right.

2424
02:41:42,920 --> 02:41:45,000
What an unbelievable catch but not good enough.

2425
02:41:46,489 --> 02:41:46,989
Dammit.

2426
02:41:47,309 --> 02:41:48,430
He's gonna come back and haunt me.

2427
02:41:49,229 --> 02:41:54,829
The crowd is twitch chat.

2428
02:41:55,790 --> 02:41:56,959
Yeah, I could see that.

2429
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:03,629
How did you not catch that?

2430
02:42:05,149 --> 02:42:05,870
Honest to god.

2431
02:42:06,430 --> 02:42:07,389
How did you not get that?

2432
02:42:08,270 --> 02:42:14,719
Wait, where's this guy going?

2433
02:42:16,659 --> 02:42:17,299
Beautiful move.

2434
02:42:17,860 --> 02:42:18,579
Beautiful fumble.

2435
02:42:21,379 --> 02:42:22,579
Why did he run that way?

2436
02:42:22,579 --> 02:42:23,780
I ran him that way.

2437
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:24,280
Fuck me.

2438
02:42:30,659 --> 02:42:35,250
Not this time.

2439
02:42:35,250 --> 02:42:36,370
How the fuck?

2440
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:38,620
This quarterback is too good.

2441
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:40,770
I have to win by 20 points.

2442
02:42:41,489 --> 02:42:43,680
I'm trying to do a not terrible.

2443
02:42:44,399 --> 02:42:50,159
What if Jerma was one of us?

2444
02:42:53,340 --> 02:43:03,420
The Super Bowls are gonna win.

2445
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:05,100
I can't believe the Patriots won the Super Bowl again.

2446
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:17,100
How'd you run out of bounds there?

2447
02:43:17,659 --> 02:43:22,610
There's no reason for you to run out of bounds.

2448
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:24,290
You had an opportunity to run.

2449
02:43:29,459 --> 02:43:29,959
Damn.

2450
02:43:30,579 --> 02:43:31,459
Turnover on downs.

2451
02:43:31,459 --> 02:43:31,959
Didn't get it.

2452
02:43:32,899 --> 02:43:33,700
It's third.

2453
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:35,059
All right, it's my opportunity to make it.

2454
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:36,979
My $15,000 bet.

2455
02:43:37,700 --> 02:43:40,799
Let's run it.

2456
02:43:42,219 --> 02:43:43,579
First down and 30.

2457
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:49,280
I'll take it.

2458
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:54,739
Uh, is this game online or is he playing against himself?

2459
02:43:54,739 --> 02:43:55,540
I'm just playing against you.

2460
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:57,459
As we reach the end of the third quarter,

2461
02:43:57,459 --> 02:43:59,459
Las Vegas leads by 22.

2462
02:43:59,459 --> 02:44:00,979
This is an old PlayStation 3 game.

2463
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:03,139
What's the League 2?

2464
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:04,760
It is.

2465
02:44:04,819 --> 02:44:06,979
Sometimes I wish I was just sitting down there with a...

2466
02:44:06,979 --> 02:44:08,340
This was definitely one of the best.

2467
02:44:09,059 --> 02:44:10,340
Sit down with like a buddy.

2468
02:44:10,979 --> 02:44:12,739
And just shit talk to each other and play again.

2469
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:14,360
Lofts one.

2470
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:21,250
And the defender gets a hand on it and it's incomplete.

2471
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:29,479
Sit down with a buddy.

2472
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:34,659
Doesn't bounce, right?

2473
02:44:34,659 --> 02:44:36,180
Looks like they'll have four more downs to work with.

2474
02:44:37,139 --> 02:44:37,780
All right, here it is.

2475
02:44:38,979 --> 02:44:39,459
Red zone.

2476
02:44:39,459 --> 02:44:40,579
We're gonna go run right up the middle.

2477
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:42,819
Let's see if the offense can keep it going here in the red zone.

2478
02:44:44,819 --> 02:44:47,969
Oh, did I lose yards?

2479
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:50,370
I don't think I'm fighting right now.

2480
02:44:53,250 --> 02:44:53,750
Again.

2481
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,770
Fifth play of the drive.

2482
02:44:56,959 --> 02:45:01,190
Touchdown!

2483
02:45:01,190 --> 02:45:05,190
Las Vegas refuses to call off the dogs as they add to their lead.

2484
02:45:06,149 --> 02:45:07,590
And I got a big bet riding on this.

2485
02:45:08,709 --> 02:45:11,700
Just field goal.

2486
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:12,739
I want to keep my unleash.

2487
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:21,139
It's good.

2488
02:45:21,780 --> 02:45:26,579
Just gotta hold him.

2489
02:45:27,379 --> 02:45:35,600
If you remember, I was there when rage quit Jets sent radio.

2490
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:37,760
Were you there when I exploded the guy's balls?

2491
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:54,000
It didn't happen, but.

2492
02:45:58,979 --> 02:45:59,620
44.

2493
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:00,899
I'm stroying with now.

2494
02:46:12,049 --> 02:46:14,629
This is not even a contest anymore.

2495
02:46:15,969 --> 02:46:17,090
He's very injured, too.

2496
02:46:17,969 --> 02:46:18,770
Look at this guy.

2497
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:20,129
This guy's in pain.

2498
02:46:21,889 --> 02:46:22,690
Oh, wrong guy.

2499
02:46:23,489 --> 02:46:24,690
This is the guy standing next to him.

2500
02:46:25,409 --> 02:46:27,680
More like dumb luck.

2501
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:30,879
That one's already been used.

2502
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:35,040
All right, I got an unleash.

2503
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:36,959
Let's take the quarterback out of the game.

2504
02:46:36,959 --> 02:46:38,000
And out of the seat.

2505
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:42,629
And now I'm in.

2506
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:48,149
Oh, he's gonna be funny about it.

2507
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:01,940
Yeah, you get a little prize.

2508
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:02,979
You got 13 points.

2509
02:47:02,979 --> 02:47:03,459
Good for you.

2510
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,920
Get it!

2511
02:47:08,690 --> 02:47:10,209
I'm caring so much about trying to

2512
02:47:10,209 --> 02:47:11,170
kill the quarterback.

2513
02:47:11,809 --> 02:47:18,370
Let's turn off the announcer.

2514
02:47:22,360 --> 02:47:23,559
Do you really want me to turn him off?

2515
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:29,059
It's all right.

2516
02:47:29,059 --> 02:47:30,790
He was resilient.

2517
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:36,709
Okay, our new mantra is run the ball, burn the clock.

2518
02:47:36,709 --> 02:47:37,909
Yeah, run the ball, burn the clock.

2519
02:47:43,799 --> 02:47:51,729
Oh, I punched him so hard in the face.

2520
02:47:51,729 --> 02:47:52,450
Oh, look at me!

2521
02:47:58,340 --> 02:47:59,379
I punched him.

2522
02:47:59,379 --> 02:48:00,180
I punched him so bad.

2523
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:03,139
Very nice run.

2524
02:48:03,139 --> 02:48:06,899
His legs never stop moving and his eyes never stop looking for Dayla.

2525
02:48:06,899 --> 02:48:09,860
Let's go with the pass.

2526
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:11,059
I have 50 points.

2527
02:48:23,489 --> 02:48:24,850
Well, I thought it was going to be circle weather.

2528
02:48:25,729 --> 02:48:28,120
Look, when you're up by 50 points, you kind of just...

2529
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:30,040
Can I take off my starters?

2530
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:41,760
Let's go with the PS.

2531
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:43,040
My controller turned off.

2532
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:43,680
Is that a battery?

2533
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:45,200
I need a battery right now.

2534
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:49,729
The offense looking at first and 30.

2535
02:48:50,370 --> 02:48:51,479
I need a plug.

2536
02:48:54,200 --> 02:49:01,459
This one fits, right?

2537
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:05,430
It does.

2538
02:49:12,229 --> 02:49:13,430
Where's the USB?

2539
02:49:13,430 --> 02:49:13,989
It's right here.

2540
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:17,350
The offense has a ways to go here on second down.

2541
02:49:18,469 --> 02:49:19,989
How do you get the USB in here?

2542
02:49:26,079 --> 02:49:27,280
All right, I'm plugged back in.

2543
02:49:28,979 --> 02:49:30,100
We're good, I think.

2544
02:49:33,889 --> 02:49:34,690
It's just blinking.

2545
02:49:38,069 --> 02:49:38,790
How do I do this?

2546
02:49:39,590 --> 02:49:43,319
Why is it not just syncing?

2547
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:44,920
Why does it have to sync?

2548
02:49:51,649 --> 02:49:52,950
Got it.

2549
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:53,670
Okay, it's back, it's back.

2550
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:00,790
Hey, yeah, that's not fair.

2551
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:01,829
That's fine, yeah.

2552
02:50:02,629 --> 02:50:15,889
You get to play against a non-opponent for a minute.

2553
02:50:15,889 --> 02:50:19,600
What?

2554
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:21,040
I intercepted the ball?

2555
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:22,479
Did he throw it in?

2556
02:50:27,989 --> 02:50:28,389
I don't...

2557
02:50:33,170 --> 02:50:33,729
No.

2558
02:50:33,729 --> 02:50:34,049
How do...

2559
02:50:34,049 --> 02:50:35,409
I wish I could slow this down.

2560
02:50:36,819 --> 02:50:38,979
There's no way to slow it down, huh?

2561
02:50:48,639 --> 02:50:54,840
I don't know.

2562
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:55,340
Nice work.

2563
02:50:55,959 --> 02:50:58,709
All right, let's just throw an end zone pass.

2564
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:02,469
See if I can get to 58 points.

2565
02:51:15,270 --> 02:51:17,920
You're not on code again.

2566
02:51:19,139 --> 02:51:20,260
58 points, let's get it.

2567
02:51:21,139 --> 02:51:28,020
Oh my god, what are you doing?

2568
02:51:28,739 --> 02:51:28,979
What?

2569
02:51:28,979 --> 02:51:49,430
Oh, this poor guy.

2570
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:53,030
And so, Las Vegas is your winner here tonight.

2571
02:51:53,030 --> 02:51:55,299
For the wrong code, joke isn't a joke.

2572
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:59,159
No, I'm just trying to find other codes.

2573
02:52:01,219 --> 02:52:04,020
I'm just doing random buttons to try to find other codes.

2574
02:52:04,659 --> 02:52:05,620
Because there's a shitload of them.

2575
02:52:08,799 --> 02:52:09,440
All right, I got...

2576
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:10,319
I'm gonna get a lot of money.

2577
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:12,799
I had a lot of points, a lot of dirty hits, a lot of flashes.

2578
02:52:14,629 --> 02:52:15,270
Touchdowns.

2579
02:52:17,809 --> 02:52:18,610
Yeah, 400 grand.

2580
02:52:22,879 --> 02:52:24,159
Uh, I got some movies.

2581
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:25,840
Very cool.

2582
02:52:26,559 --> 02:52:28,579
What's my sweat like?

2583
02:52:28,579 --> 02:52:29,700
But I'm not...

2584
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:30,100
I'm fine.

2585
02:52:30,819 --> 02:52:34,049
We're about to make it into the next...

2586
02:52:34,049 --> 02:52:34,690
We're about to win.

2587
02:52:38,610 --> 02:52:39,250
Agent.

2588
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:42,500
Franchise, main man, you feeling pumped?

2589
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:44,040
Because I'm feeling...

2590
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:45,959
This is it, the big bucks, baby.

2591
02:52:45,959 --> 02:52:47,959
Your first commercial shoot.

2592
02:52:47,959 --> 02:52:50,360
You just suit up and do everything I tell you.

2593
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:52,440
And let the cameraman do the rest.

2594
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:56,200
You nail this and we will have the sponsors eating out of our hands.

2595
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:59,719
Okay, I got to score at least three touchdowns against Detroit.

2596
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:06,920
No new sponsors.

2597
02:53:09,639 --> 02:53:10,200
Training.

2598
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:10,920
Let's take a look.

2599
02:53:11,719 --> 02:53:14,069
I want to take a look at how everybody's doing, too.

2600
02:53:14,069 --> 02:53:15,270
So I got 400 grand.

2601
02:53:16,389 --> 02:53:18,309
Resist injury is probably a good idea.

2602
02:53:18,309 --> 02:53:18,790
Speed.

2603
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:29,409
Passing.

2604
02:53:30,049 --> 02:53:35,280
Grip master, more strength.

2605
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:39,250
I'm gonna do speed.

2606
02:53:40,290 --> 02:53:41,170
Speed and...

2607
02:53:42,049 --> 02:53:46,719
Speed and passing.

2608
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:49,219
I might be able to do one more.

2609
02:53:49,219 --> 02:53:50,100
And resist injury.

2610
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,219
Big spender.

2611
02:53:55,219 --> 02:53:56,340
All right, so we're doing all right.

2612
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:00,559
75 tackle.

2613
02:54:00,559 --> 02:54:02,159
People are ranking up.

2614
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:08,959
Oh, I have to actually...

2615
02:54:08,959 --> 02:54:10,879
Okay, train the attributes now.

2616
02:54:10,879 --> 02:54:11,840
So this is me.

2617
02:54:12,799 --> 02:54:15,909
Oh, I gotta set it to automatic.

2618
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:19,459
It's on automatic, isn't it?

2619
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:25,559
Pass and kick plus five.

2620
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,040
Hands, strength.

2621
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,600
Break tackle is so bad.

2622
02:54:39,670 --> 02:54:41,270
Yeah, just keep it there.

2623
02:54:41,270 --> 02:54:42,979
That's fine.

2624
02:54:42,979 --> 02:54:43,620
Yeah, it is doing it.

2625
02:54:43,620 --> 02:54:44,979
It's doing it automatically.

2626
02:54:44,979 --> 02:54:45,379
I see.

2627
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:46,579
Okay, we're good.

2628
02:54:48,079 --> 02:54:48,879
How about drugs?

2629
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:51,540
I got 50 grand.

2630
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:53,700
Let's go with turbo bar.

2631
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:54,420
Reduce the...

2632
02:54:54,420 --> 02:54:55,299
Turbo bar drain.

2633
02:55:01,430 --> 02:55:02,629
Let's reduce the stamina loss.

2634
02:55:03,190 --> 02:55:06,979
Let's also give this again.

2635
02:55:09,159 --> 02:55:10,680
Turbo bar to the halfback.

2636
02:55:14,159 --> 02:55:14,959
I don't want to get arrested,

2637
02:55:14,959 --> 02:55:16,000
so I'm gonna keep it like that.

2638
02:55:16,739 --> 02:55:17,780
Although, let's go to defense.

2639
02:55:21,379 --> 02:55:23,840
I'm gonna get in trouble.

2640
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:25,670
All right, let's go.

2641
02:55:26,469 --> 02:55:28,840
This is the Detroit Devils.

2642
02:55:29,479 --> 02:55:35,329
4-0.

2643
02:55:36,049 --> 02:55:37,969
Las Vegas must win by more than 23 points.

2644
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:41,479
Max bet.

2645
02:55:43,350 --> 02:55:45,750
This week, we've got the Detroit Devils.

2646
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:46,709
Once upon a time,

2647
02:55:46,709 --> 02:55:47,909
this was a pretty good team.

2648
02:55:48,629 --> 02:55:50,549
But there's a cancer in that locker room,

2649
02:55:50,549 --> 02:55:52,229
and his name is Cookie Wallace.

2650
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:54,069
On a good day,

2651
02:55:54,069 --> 02:55:56,069
Cookie is one of the best receivers in the game.

2652
02:55:58,629 --> 02:55:59,430
Thing is,

2653
02:55:59,430 --> 02:56:01,670
he ain't having as many good days as he used to.

2654
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:03,590
And of course,

2655
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:06,149
he blames everyone else for his screw-ups.

2656
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:08,629
So the team sucks,

2657
02:56:08,629 --> 02:56:09,110
but he's...

2658
02:56:10,229 --> 02:56:12,209
I don't understand.

2659
02:56:12,930 --> 02:56:15,239
So maybe I should leave him in the game.

2660
02:56:15,799 --> 02:56:19,719
Should I just not try to hurt him?

2661
02:56:19,719 --> 02:56:22,260
If the team sucks when he's on it,

2662
02:56:22,260 --> 02:56:23,059
I should leave him be.

2663
02:56:29,879 --> 02:56:31,319
Selfish and undisciplined.

2664
02:56:33,350 --> 02:56:33,670
Okay.

2665
02:56:40,069 --> 02:56:41,030
Go after everyone else.

2666
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:42,069
Thanks for joining us.

2667
02:56:42,069 --> 02:56:44,389
We're partway through the Division 3 season,

2668
02:56:44,389 --> 02:56:46,549
and this team has been making some noise.

2669
02:56:46,549 --> 02:56:47,750
Let's hope they can keep it up.

2670
02:56:47,750 --> 02:56:49,670
And now let's get ready for the kickoff.

2671
02:56:50,870 --> 02:56:51,989
Come on.

2672
02:56:51,989 --> 02:56:53,110
Why does that keep happening?

2673
02:56:54,469 --> 02:56:55,750
Looks like a fumble shoot.

2674
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:55,909
Okay.

2675
02:56:55,909 --> 02:56:57,110
Whoever that is.

2676
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:57,670
82?

2677
02:56:58,950 --> 02:56:59,829
Fuck you, 82.

2678
02:56:59,829 --> 02:57:01,030
That was ridiculous.

2679
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:01,590
Come on, now.

2680
02:57:02,629 --> 02:57:10,260
Damn.

2681
02:57:10,260 --> 02:57:10,819
Uh-oh.

2682
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:14,389
Oh, that's a neck cleat.

2683
02:57:19,329 --> 02:57:20,049
There's Robbie.

2684
02:57:21,489 --> 02:57:22,610
That guy's on drugs, too.

2685
02:57:22,610 --> 02:57:23,409
I gotta get him back in.

2686
02:57:23,409 --> 02:57:24,129
Hold on, buddy.

2687
02:57:24,129 --> 02:57:25,090
Look at the run in the background.

2688
02:57:25,090 --> 02:57:26,530
Hey, get the cart out here.

2689
02:57:26,530 --> 02:57:27,409
I gotta make this good.

2690
02:57:27,409 --> 02:57:28,049
Take it easy, buddy.

2691
02:57:28,049 --> 02:57:29,010
It'll be over in a second.

2692
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:31,010
That's all right.

2693
02:57:31,010 --> 02:57:32,129
Take it easy, buddy.

2694
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:33,969
Three plays and one stamina boost.

2695
02:57:36,930 --> 02:57:38,559
All right.

2696
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:39,920
This team is kind of hurting me.

2697
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:44,340
That's smart.

2698
02:57:45,059 --> 02:57:52,000
Just like those are the reason that man needs to be a big part of this offense.

2699
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,040
Exemplary catch.

2700
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:54,319
I'm not doing any running plays.

2701
02:57:54,319 --> 02:57:55,120
I don't have my hat back.

2702
02:57:58,129 --> 02:57:59,489
And he's the one on drugs.

2703
02:57:59,489 --> 02:58:00,530
I gotta keep him okay.

2704
02:58:01,729 --> 02:58:02,129
Cut it.

2705
02:58:02,129 --> 02:58:02,450
Cut it.

2706
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:03,090
Somebody cut it.

2707
02:58:03,889 --> 02:58:05,520
Just short of the first.

2708
02:58:06,850 --> 02:58:07,170
All right.

2709
02:58:07,170 --> 02:58:07,729
I gotta run.

2710
02:58:07,729 --> 02:58:08,530
I have to.

2711
02:58:08,530 --> 02:58:09,569
I'm gonna do a QB sneak.

2712
02:58:09,569 --> 02:58:11,409
No, he made it here on time.

2713
02:58:12,129 --> 02:58:12,610
I'm just running.

2714
02:58:12,610 --> 02:58:13,489
I'm gonna walk over the...

2715
02:58:13,489 --> 02:58:14,610
I'm walking over the line right now.

2716
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:15,329
Three, two, one, go.

2717
02:58:20,610 --> 02:58:29,620
God damn it.

2718
02:58:29,620 --> 02:58:30,100
It's all right.

2719
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:38,799
It's because my halfback got hurt.

2720
02:58:38,799 --> 02:58:40,000
I would have ran with the halfback.

2721
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:44,959
Kill somebody already.

2722
02:58:44,959 --> 02:58:45,440
I...

2723
02:58:45,440 --> 02:58:46,239
I got killed.

2724
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:49,520
My guy was injured.

2725
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:49,680
I...

2726
02:58:58,520 --> 02:58:58,840
Guys.

2727
02:58:59,559 --> 02:59:00,840
Oh, I had an opportunity.

2728
02:59:00,840 --> 02:59:01,879
But it's okay.

2729
02:59:01,879 --> 02:59:02,760
As long as I keep him.

2730
02:59:03,319 --> 02:59:03,799
Third down.

2731
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:07,270
Let's do some zones here.

2732
02:59:12,340 --> 02:59:15,569
Oh, damn it.

2733
02:59:15,569 --> 02:59:16,850
He unleashed to catch it.

2734
02:59:16,850 --> 02:59:18,530
It's a free catch if you unleash.

2735
02:59:18,530 --> 02:59:18,770
Fuck.

2736
02:59:19,409 --> 02:59:23,489
God damn halfback got injured in the first play.

2737
02:59:23,489 --> 02:59:24,770
And then I fumbled the ball.

2738
02:59:25,489 --> 02:59:27,620
It's still early.

2739
02:59:38,340 --> 02:59:42,899
Is Vegas falling from grace?

2740
02:59:43,860 --> 02:59:44,579
No, not yet.

2741
02:59:45,219 --> 02:59:47,030
I'll take it back here.

2742
02:59:47,030 --> 02:59:48,229
I'm gonna get my halfback.

2743
02:59:48,229 --> 02:59:49,430
He's gonna come back.

2744
02:59:49,430 --> 02:59:53,440
This is the turnaround right here.

2745
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,379
They're pretty rough.

2746
02:59:58,340 --> 03:00:00,239
Holy...

2747
03:00:00,879 --> 03:00:02,239
Good thing he's got insurance.

2748
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:04,079
There he is.

2749
03:00:04,879 --> 03:00:05,600
There you go.

2750
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:06,799
You're all right, buddy.

2751
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:07,360
Robbie's back.

2752
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:08,719
Next play.

2753
03:00:13,219 --> 03:00:18,360
There it is.

2754
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:19,319
Let's bring it back.

2755
03:00:19,319 --> 03:00:20,200
Don't taunt.

2756
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:21,639
Just score the fucking touchdown.

2757
03:00:31,159 --> 03:00:31,879
I gotta take the lead.

2758
03:00:31,879 --> 03:00:32,600
Let's go.

2759
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:33,079
Take the lead.

2760
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:39,239
Yes!

2761
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:40,760
Across the plane.

2762
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:50,079
Look up codes.

2763
03:00:50,799 --> 03:00:51,200
I mean, I'm...

2764
03:00:53,399 --> 03:00:53,799
Oh, no.

2765
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:55,159
Oh, no.

2766
03:00:55,159 --> 03:00:55,799
Oh, no.

2767
03:00:57,079 --> 03:00:57,319
No.

2768
03:00:59,959 --> 03:01:00,600
Look up codes.

2769
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:01,719
I was looking at chat.

2770
03:01:19,059 --> 03:01:21,440
I got it.

2771
03:01:21,440 --> 03:01:22,399
Killed Cookie.

2772
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:22,719
I know.

2773
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:28,180
There's gonna be a back and forth here.

2774
03:01:28,180 --> 03:01:29,379
And all I need is a touchdown.

2775
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:31,000
I got the two.

2776
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,120
They didn't get a two-point conversion.

2777
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:32,440
I did.

2778
03:01:33,159 --> 03:01:43,319
All right.

2779
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:44,040
They got an unleash.

2780
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:44,920
I'm about to have one.

2781
03:01:45,719 --> 03:01:49,569
I gotta...

2782
03:01:49,569 --> 03:01:50,209
I gotta run it out.

2783
03:01:50,209 --> 03:01:51,889
I gotta pass and run out of bounds.

2784
03:01:51,889 --> 03:01:52,930
I have to get that.

2785
03:01:52,930 --> 03:01:54,290
Otherwise, I'm gonna get fumbled again.

2786
03:01:55,250 --> 03:02:07,780
Let's hug the right side.

2787
03:02:10,469 --> 03:02:14,920
Stay!

2788
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,159
No!

2789
03:02:15,959 --> 03:02:16,920
Out of bounds, please.

2790
03:02:19,649 --> 03:02:20,049
Yeah!

2791
03:02:22,239 --> 03:02:22,719
Yes!

2792
03:02:22,719 --> 03:02:24,319
And so at the end of one quarter...

2793
03:02:24,319 --> 03:02:25,600
Wow, that was lucky.

2794
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:26,719
Leads by six.

2795
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:30,600
Aren't you guys lotioning up your hands?

2796
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:32,760
I need to upgrade the hands.

2797
03:02:32,760 --> 03:02:34,040
It's bad.

2798
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:35,079
It's very bad.

2799
03:02:35,079 --> 03:02:36,120
I need to upgrade hands.

2800
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:37,719
First and goal.

2801
03:02:37,719 --> 03:02:38,920
It's gut check time.

2802
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:40,520
Ball at the 22-yard line.

2803
03:02:41,879 --> 03:02:45,639
Goes way downfield.

2804
03:02:45,639 --> 03:02:46,520
He's got it.

2805
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:47,079
Touchdown.

2806
03:02:55,760 --> 03:02:58,319
So I have an unleash.

2807
03:02:58,319 --> 03:02:58,959
It's tied up.

2808
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:01,329
Oh, should I be safe?

2809
03:03:01,329 --> 03:03:03,569
Okay, we got the set.

2810
03:03:03,569 --> 03:03:04,690
We're picking up the trail

2811
03:03:04,690 --> 03:03:06,370
and we'll check up like the dogs they are.

2812
03:03:07,329 --> 03:03:24,360
Okay, tie game.

2813
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:27,639
Injury time.

2814
03:03:30,239 --> 03:03:31,440
No, I wanted to select it,

2815
03:03:31,440 --> 03:03:32,239
but I couldn't get it.

2816
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:38,719
Cycles through like everybody on the team.

2817
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:42,280
No, I...

2818
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:43,000
Let me hit him.

2819
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:45,159
Let me hit him.

2820
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:46,840
Stop getting in my way.

2821
03:03:47,639 --> 03:04:00,479
Did that just happen?

2822
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:03,040
That just happened.

2823
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:05,120
It just comes easy to this guy.

2824
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:06,159
Sure, he works hard.

2825
03:04:06,159 --> 03:04:06,799
He has talent.

2826
03:04:06,799 --> 03:04:07,360
I can't believe it.

2827
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:09,840
But that's what makes these sorts of plays so easy for him.

2828
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:10,399
Bravo.

2829
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:12,479
Or injury.

2830
03:04:12,479 --> 03:04:12,979
Heart.

2831
03:04:14,719 --> 03:04:16,879
He lets it fly.

2832
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:18,559
And he makes the grab.

2833
03:04:18,559 --> 03:04:19,840
Oh, man!

2834
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:20,639
Hookie Wallace.

2835
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,069
If they would just get out of my way

2836
03:04:24,069 --> 03:04:25,190
and let me tackle them,

2837
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:27,030
I would have tackled them two plays ago.

2838
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:34,790
He was right in my line of sight.

2839
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:35,590
I have an unleash

2840
03:04:35,590 --> 03:04:36,950
and some guy bumped into it.

2841
03:04:37,590 --> 03:04:40,020
They're making this hard for me, guys.

2842
03:04:40,020 --> 03:04:41,059
Get out of my fucking way.

2843
03:04:41,059 --> 03:04:41,700
I'm the captain.

2844
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:42,899
I say what I say goes.

2845
03:04:43,540 --> 03:04:52,290
Who gets the ball?

2846
03:04:52,930 --> 03:05:02,819
That's who.

2847
03:05:04,450 --> 03:05:05,809
You got the smelling salts?

2848
03:05:05,809 --> 03:05:06,610
Yeah, yeah.

2849
03:05:06,610 --> 03:05:07,170
Hold on.

2850
03:05:07,170 --> 03:05:07,489
You know what?

2851
03:05:07,489 --> 03:05:07,889
Never mind.

2852
03:05:07,889 --> 03:05:08,930
Let's just get the card out here.

2853
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:10,049
That's a good idea.

2854
03:05:10,049 --> 03:05:10,850
Yeah, bring it up.

2855
03:05:14,079 --> 03:05:14,639
Oh, no.

2856
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:16,479
Oh, that's not good.

2857
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:18,239
That's not good.

2858
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:21,670
Actually dead.

2859
03:05:23,299 --> 03:05:24,420
Oh, God.

2860
03:05:24,979 --> 03:05:26,100
This is not going well.

2861
03:05:27,139 --> 03:05:28,739
He's going long.

2862
03:05:28,739 --> 03:05:30,819
And it's complete at the 46 yard line.

2863
03:05:30,819 --> 03:05:32,579
Two unleashed just ran into each other.

2864
03:05:32,579 --> 03:05:33,139
That's what happens.

2865
03:05:34,899 --> 03:05:36,680
Oh, nice pass.

2866
03:05:37,239 --> 03:05:37,879
Wish I had that.

2867
03:05:39,639 --> 03:05:46,530
Get over that first down.

2868
03:05:47,329 --> 03:05:48,049
Did you get it?

2869
03:05:48,770 --> 03:05:49,250
I didn't get it.

2870
03:05:49,250 --> 03:05:49,809
No, that's not.

2871
03:05:49,809 --> 03:05:50,850
No, it's not what I said.

2872
03:05:51,409 --> 03:05:53,250
I said if it was up to me.

2873
03:05:53,250 --> 03:05:54,049
It's not.

2874
03:05:54,049 --> 03:05:56,129
But the offense is looking at third and short.

2875
03:06:02,239 --> 03:06:02,739
Get it.

2876
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:05,780
First down.

2877
03:06:06,819 --> 03:06:09,079
We're doing all right.

2878
03:06:09,079 --> 03:06:09,879
Everything's going fine.

2879
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:13,969
Let's try to run it here.

2880
03:06:19,569 --> 03:06:21,090
Who wins in the unleashed fight?

2881
03:06:21,889 --> 03:06:22,930
Who wins?

2882
03:06:24,959 --> 03:06:25,440
Time out.

2883
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:25,920
Time out.

2884
03:06:26,559 --> 03:06:30,799
I still have my unleashed.

2885
03:06:31,360 --> 03:06:35,649
I got it.

2886
03:06:45,110 --> 03:06:45,989
You've got to be kidding me.

2887
03:06:45,989 --> 03:06:48,469
And so at halftime Detroit leads by seven.

2888
03:06:48,469 --> 03:06:49,510
That was an unleashed catch.

2889
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:50,309
It's supposed to be guaranteed.

2890
03:06:51,350 --> 03:07:03,649
All right.

2891
03:07:03,649 --> 03:07:04,049
Injured.

2892
03:07:07,409 --> 03:07:07,969
Injury.

2893
03:07:08,930 --> 03:07:09,170
No.

2894
03:07:09,809 --> 03:07:10,129
Why?

2895
03:07:10,690 --> 03:07:11,569
It's not fair.

2896
03:07:11,569 --> 03:07:11,969
Kill it.

2897
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:14,819
Break is back.

2898
03:07:16,770 --> 03:07:17,090
Yes.

2899
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:19,299
He's too good.

2900
03:07:19,299 --> 03:07:19,940
Get rid of him.

2901
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:22,500
Oh, my God.

2902
03:07:23,459 --> 03:07:25,909
I think it's separated.

2903
03:07:25,909 --> 03:07:26,469
Stay down.

2904
03:07:26,469 --> 03:07:28,309
Cookie has made every single play.

2905
03:07:28,309 --> 03:07:29,750
He's made every single touchdown.

2906
03:07:30,709 --> 03:07:31,670
Not anymore.

2907
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:32,149
You're out.

2908
03:07:32,790 --> 03:07:41,670
And everyone on the same page there.

2909
03:07:41,670 --> 03:07:43,670
And they are rewarded with a very nice game.

2910
03:07:44,229 --> 03:07:46,690
You only have five plays.

2911
03:07:46,690 --> 03:07:47,170
It's all right.

2912
03:07:47,170 --> 03:07:47,969
That's an entire.

2913
03:07:55,010 --> 03:07:57,090
I'm so amped up right now.

2914
03:07:57,090 --> 03:07:57,969
I've got to win.

2915
03:07:57,969 --> 03:07:59,010
I've got to go five and up.

2916
03:07:59,809 --> 03:08:00,610
I just fucked it up.

2917
03:08:02,549 --> 03:08:04,790
Oh, the receiver's taken out of the play.

2918
03:08:04,790 --> 03:08:05,829
And that's incomplete.

2919
03:08:06,790 --> 03:08:09,719
He falls on him.

2920
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:12,610
Here's my guy.

2921
03:08:13,329 --> 03:08:20,180
He's just serious to let him get by you.

2922
03:08:21,379 --> 03:08:22,739
How could you let you hat you?

2923
03:08:22,739 --> 03:08:24,180
You were holding onto him.

2924
03:08:26,979 --> 03:08:28,260
How did you let that happen?

2925
03:08:29,059 --> 03:08:30,020
You tackled him.

2926
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:31,139
And he just walked off.

2927
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:34,069
This team's training.

2928
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:37,280
I'm going to fucking close the door on this.

2929
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:41,379
These idiots can't do anything on defense.

2930
03:09:07,889 --> 03:09:09,250
I'm just like pissed off.

2931
03:09:09,250 --> 03:09:11,569
At like Cookie, whatever his name is.

2932
03:09:15,590 --> 03:09:15,989
It's all right.

2933
03:09:15,989 --> 03:09:16,950
Keep it going.

2934
03:09:16,950 --> 03:09:24,280
Let's run it.

2935
03:09:41,329 --> 03:09:42,770
How have I not found a random code?

2936
03:09:43,649 --> 03:09:44,280
Okay.

2937
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:45,719
I need this two point conversion.

2938
03:09:45,719 --> 03:09:47,079
I need it bad.

2939
03:09:47,079 --> 03:09:48,200
Very, very badly.

2940
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:49,000
Very badly.

2941
03:09:50,579 --> 03:09:51,059
Let's go.

2942
03:10:14,229 --> 03:10:14,950
Cookie hurt him.

2943
03:10:14,950 --> 03:10:15,510
He's back in.

2944
03:10:15,510 --> 03:10:16,309
He's injured.

2945
03:10:16,309 --> 03:10:16,870
Make it work.

2946
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:17,430
Make it happen.

2947
03:10:20,930 --> 03:10:21,649
Look at that stamina.

2948
03:10:21,649 --> 03:10:22,530
It's terrible.

2949
03:10:22,530 --> 03:10:23,409
And I have a...

2950
03:10:23,409 --> 03:10:23,889
I'm going to...

2951
03:10:23,889 --> 03:10:24,690
Let's go for him again.

2952
03:10:27,510 --> 03:10:28,229
Anticipate.

2953
03:10:28,790 --> 03:10:29,909
Cookie's coming over here.

2954
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:33,889
There he is.

2955
03:10:37,350 --> 03:10:38,549
Nice try.

2956
03:10:38,549 --> 03:10:39,670
That was like a ballet move.

2957
03:10:39,670 --> 03:10:41,110
I don't think he knows what hit him.

2958
03:10:53,329 --> 03:10:54,370
That was a big sack.

2959
03:10:57,120 --> 03:10:58,239
Third and 39.

2960
03:10:58,239 --> 03:10:59,120
We're going to play cover.

2961
03:10:59,120 --> 03:11:01,200
I'm just man up in the zones.

2962
03:11:02,790 --> 03:11:05,030
There's no way you're going to get 40 goddamn yards there.

2963
03:11:05,989 --> 03:11:11,329
See you later.

2964
03:11:11,329 --> 03:11:11,809
My ball.

2965
03:11:12,530 --> 03:11:13,329
Fourth and 26.

2966
03:11:13,329 --> 03:11:14,049
They're definitely going to punt.

2967
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:20,479
And I've got an unleash.

2968
03:11:24,790 --> 03:11:28,709
As we reach the end of the third quarter, Detroit leads by eight.

2969
03:11:39,639 --> 03:11:41,399
Now I need a two point conversion.

2970
03:11:43,299 --> 03:11:44,180
Yeah, I do.

2971
03:11:45,219 --> 03:11:45,780
I do now.

2972
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:52,260
Down again.

2973
03:11:55,760 --> 03:11:57,440
You explained to me how during an unleash,

2974
03:11:57,440 --> 03:11:59,120
this guy is able to dirty hit me still.

2975
03:12:04,610 --> 03:12:05,889
All right, I've got to make the plays here.

2976
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:19,829
Let's go for a run.

2977
03:12:20,389 --> 03:12:27,799
Oh, no, no, no.

2978
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:30,600
I'm entering my unleash.

2979
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:34,879
My unleash.

2980
03:12:34,879 --> 03:12:36,559
Why does it get stopped every time?

2981
03:12:39,350 --> 03:12:40,309
That was a default.

2982
03:12:41,270 --> 03:12:41,909
Oh, fuck.

2983
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:46,389
That guy did a default tackle and I'm in a goddamn unleash.

2984
03:12:47,190 --> 03:12:48,229
I can't believe it.

2985
03:12:48,229 --> 03:12:48,629
It's okay.

2986
03:12:54,950 --> 03:13:01,750
Way to go here on third down for the big play.

2987
03:13:08,850 --> 03:13:11,489
Lots of quarterbacks can make a great pass in practice,

2988
03:13:11,489 --> 03:13:14,450
but it's out here during the game when the pros

2989
03:13:14,450 --> 03:13:17,010
really step forward with throws like that.

2990
03:13:17,010 --> 03:13:17,489
This is it.

2991
03:13:21,510 --> 03:13:31,459
I got to get that fucking ball back.

2992
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:54,659
Yes.

2993
03:13:56,319 --> 03:13:57,680
Oh, yes.

2994
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:58,799
I'm so involved.

2995
03:13:59,909 --> 03:14:00,549
Done.

2996
03:14:00,549 --> 03:14:01,350
Out for the season.

2997
03:14:04,129 --> 03:14:05,250
I'm going to call it card.

2998
03:14:05,250 --> 03:14:05,569
Okay.

2999
03:14:05,569 --> 03:14:07,010
I got to get this ball back.

3000
03:14:07,010 --> 03:14:07,170
Yeah.

3001
03:14:07,170 --> 03:14:08,290
Get it out here.

3002
03:14:08,290 --> 03:14:12,920
I'm getting too amped up over this game.

3003
03:14:13,639 --> 03:14:14,440
First and goal.

3004
03:14:15,239 --> 03:14:17,459
I have to stop them right now.

3005
03:14:17,459 --> 03:14:19,219
Crucial series of downs here.

3006
03:14:19,219 --> 03:14:20,100
They can't get a touchdown.

3007
03:14:20,100 --> 03:14:20,500
Stay back.

3008
03:14:26,629 --> 03:14:27,750
Get that fucking ball.

3009
03:14:27,750 --> 03:14:28,229
Fumble it.

3010
03:14:29,030 --> 03:14:33,299
I got an unleash.

3011
03:14:33,299 --> 03:14:34,260
I have to use it somehow.

3012
03:14:34,819 --> 03:14:37,190
Just pass into the end zone if there is.

3013
03:14:38,149 --> 03:14:41,319
I got to activate it and try to catch it.

3014
03:14:42,280 --> 03:14:44,739
There it is.

3015
03:14:44,739 --> 03:14:45,139
Fumble it.

3016
03:14:48,899 --> 03:14:50,819
How on earth did you not recover the fumble?

3017
03:14:52,100 --> 03:14:53,219
Oh, that's unbelievable.

3018
03:14:53,219 --> 03:14:54,100
I can't.

3019
03:14:54,100 --> 03:14:54,819
How?

3020
03:14:54,819 --> 03:14:56,100
Those three of you.

3021
03:14:56,100 --> 03:14:57,299
Running around in a circle around it.

3022
03:14:57,860 --> 03:14:58,340
Pick it up.

3023
03:14:59,139 --> 03:15:00,899
The offense might want to mix it up here.

3024
03:15:00,899 --> 03:15:03,059
They've been a little predictable the first two downs.

3025
03:15:12,559 --> 03:15:12,959
Take him.

3026
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:14,879
He's out of bounds.

3027
03:15:14,879 --> 03:15:15,200
All right.

3028
03:15:23,059 --> 03:15:24,180
Don't let him run up the middle.

3029
03:15:29,969 --> 03:15:30,290
Yes.

3030
03:15:31,090 --> 03:15:31,329
Okay.

3031
03:15:33,250 --> 03:15:34,049
This is bad though.

3032
03:15:34,049 --> 03:15:34,850
This is very bad.

3033
03:15:35,729 --> 03:15:41,090
I'm in my own end zone.

3034
03:15:44,530 --> 03:15:46,370
I got to get out of my own end zone now.

3035
03:15:46,370 --> 03:15:47,250
I got two timeouts.

3036
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,079
Oh, shit.

3037
03:15:49,079 --> 03:15:49,799
I have no meter.

3038
03:15:58,120 --> 03:15:58,440
Oops.

3039
03:15:58,440 --> 03:15:59,000
I know.

3040
03:15:59,000 --> 03:15:59,399
That's okay.

3041
03:16:21,280 --> 03:16:21,520
Okay.

3042
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:22,639
I got one more play.

3043
03:16:22,639 --> 03:16:24,559
I got one last play.

3044
03:16:24,559 --> 03:16:25,360
Get in the end zone.

3045
03:16:32,579 --> 03:16:42,799
Yes.

3046
03:16:43,860 --> 03:16:44,180
Okay.

3047
03:16:44,180 --> 03:16:44,819
Just kick it.

3048
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,280
Oh, I'm so excited.

3049
03:16:50,319 --> 03:16:51,440
I'm so happy.

3050
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:52,879
I'm still, I'm going to be undefeated.

3051
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,540
I'm getting way too invested in this.

3052
03:16:59,399 --> 03:17:00,360
They got one attempt here.

3053
03:17:02,979 --> 03:17:04,579
They have to run it back or touch it right now.

3054
03:17:05,219 --> 03:17:06,020
They don't have a meter.

3055
03:17:09,010 --> 03:17:09,569
Play smart.

3056
03:17:12,149 --> 03:17:12,629
Goodbye.

3057
03:17:12,629 --> 03:17:12,950
Right way.

3058
03:17:17,909 --> 03:17:18,469
God damn.

3059
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:23,860
Oh, I felt that one in my bones.

3060
03:17:37,809 --> 03:17:39,329
I didn't cause a turnover at all.

3061
03:17:40,530 --> 03:17:41,329
I lost the wager.

3062
03:17:41,329 --> 03:17:41,729
It's all right.

3063
03:17:43,090 --> 03:17:45,110
I'm just happy to be undefeated.

3064
03:17:45,670 --> 03:17:50,100
That was better than the actual Super Bowl.

3065
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:57,200
Killed a man and won the game.

3066
03:17:58,079 --> 03:17:58,319
All right.

3067
03:17:58,319 --> 03:17:58,799
We got a call.

3068
03:18:00,180 --> 03:18:01,139
Hey there.

3069
03:18:01,139 --> 03:18:03,059
I just got off the phone with the sponsor.

3070
03:18:03,059 --> 03:18:05,780
They love what they saw doing the commercial shoot.

3071
03:18:05,780 --> 03:18:07,780
We did a little negotiating and they're throwing

3072
03:18:07,780 --> 03:18:09,459
in some additional gear for your team.

3073
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:12,819
You can thank me later.

3074
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:16,280
It was killing a man worth that money.

3075
03:18:16,280 --> 03:18:16,920
Franchise.

3076
03:18:16,920 --> 03:18:17,479
Good news.

3077
03:18:17,479 --> 03:18:20,920
I've been working my magic and I've lined up another big name sponsor.

3078
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:25,559
All we need to do to seal the deal is have you make that end zone your bitch this Sunday.

3079
03:18:25,559 --> 03:18:26,840
Think you can do that?

3080
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:27,719
What am I saying?

3081
03:18:27,719 --> 03:18:29,000
Of course you can do that.

3082
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:30,280
You're the franchise.

3083
03:18:31,559 --> 03:18:31,879
God.

3084
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:37,959
So I have to get a gain of 50 plus yards on a single play.

3085
03:18:38,920 --> 03:18:45,940
Currently 5-0 against the Crusaders.

3086
03:18:45,940 --> 03:18:47,540
Let's see what we got for sponsors.

3087
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:50,840
Impact.

3088
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:54,799
Plus two tackle.

3089
03:18:54,799 --> 03:18:55,920
Plus two break tackle.

3090
03:18:56,639 --> 03:18:57,440
Plus two hands.

3091
03:18:57,440 --> 03:18:58,319
Plus two speed.

3092
03:19:00,979 --> 03:19:01,379
All right.

3093
03:19:01,379 --> 03:19:01,780
Cool.

3094
03:19:01,780 --> 03:19:03,059
Exclusive sponsor equipment.

3095
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:05,590
Upgrades.

3096
03:19:07,969 --> 03:19:08,370
Hands.

3097
03:19:08,930 --> 03:19:09,569
280.

3098
03:19:09,569 --> 03:19:10,290
I don't have enough money.

3099
03:19:10,290 --> 03:19:11,090
Damn it.

3100
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:18,360
Do I just hold on to the money?

3101
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:22,159
What can I do?

3102
03:19:24,149 --> 03:19:25,110
I can do blocking.

3103
03:19:26,229 --> 03:19:26,870
Probably need it.

3104
03:19:28,979 --> 03:19:29,940
Resist injury.

3105
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:33,239
Turbo jets inside of the massage pool.

3106
03:19:33,879 --> 03:19:39,090
Agility maybe.

3107
03:19:41,969 --> 03:19:44,579
I'm going to hold on to the money.

3108
03:19:48,229 --> 03:19:49,190
Agility block.

3109
03:19:49,190 --> 03:19:50,229
I need no block.

3110
03:19:52,579 --> 03:19:52,899
Yeah.

3111
03:19:52,899 --> 03:19:53,700
Get everything to one.

3112
03:19:53,700 --> 03:19:54,500
That's not a bad idea.

3113
03:19:56,040 --> 03:19:56,600
What about drugs?

3114
03:19:56,600 --> 03:19:57,879
What can I take for drugs?

3115
03:19:57,879 --> 03:19:58,440
Okay.

3116
03:19:58,440 --> 03:19:59,959
I just accidentally took them.

3117
03:19:59,959 --> 03:20:00,760
I don't even know what they are.

3118
03:20:01,719 --> 03:20:02,280
What are those?

3119
03:20:02,920 --> 03:20:03,479
I don't know.

3120
03:20:05,569 --> 03:20:08,129
I just took a handful of random drugs and I don't know what they do.

3121
03:20:08,770 --> 03:20:13,879
Okay.

3122
03:20:17,059 --> 03:20:17,780
5-0.

3123
03:20:17,780 --> 03:20:20,260
I got five grand versus Cincinnati Crusaders.

3124
03:20:23,350 --> 03:20:24,100
I don't know.

3125
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:28,450
After that last one, I can't believe I got to get my shit together, right?

3126
03:20:29,569 --> 03:20:32,209
Let me take a piss and grab another Coke.

3127
03:20:32,209 --> 03:20:42,600
I'll be right back.

3128
03:20:42,600 --> 03:20:43,479
Everyone says again.

3129
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:44,600
Yeah.

3130
03:20:44,600 --> 03:20:47,159
I slammed that last Coke and now I got to pee it out.

3131
03:20:47,879 --> 03:23:03,219
I just realized something.

3132
03:23:04,579 --> 03:23:06,770
Holy shit.

3133
03:23:06,770 --> 03:23:08,450
Is it a good time to be a Boston sports fan?

3134
03:23:09,170 --> 03:23:10,690
The Red Sox just won the World Series.

3135
03:23:11,250 --> 03:23:14,440
Patriots just won the Super Bowl.

3136
03:23:14,440 --> 03:23:14,840
Wow.

3137
03:23:14,840 --> 03:23:16,520
I just realized that right now.

3138
03:23:21,350 --> 03:23:22,149
Let me know you didn't.

3139
03:23:26,530 --> 03:23:29,329
Well, I mean, what am I just realizing this yet?

3140
03:23:29,329 --> 03:23:33,170
Because the Patriots just like 40 minutes ago won the Super Bowl.

3141
03:23:33,170 --> 03:23:37,409
It's better to be a Las Vegas fan.

3142
03:23:37,409 --> 03:23:37,969
Well, not yet.

3143
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:39,319
Not yet.

3144
03:23:44,069 --> 03:23:45,590
Not till like 2020.

3145
03:23:45,590 --> 03:23:49,000
But let's go.

3146
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:50,120
The Cincinnati Crusaders.

3147
03:23:52,760 --> 03:23:56,549
Oh, must mean by more than 15 points.

3148
03:23:56,549 --> 03:23:57,190
I don't even have any.

3149
03:23:57,190 --> 03:23:57,989
No, no bet.

3150
03:23:57,989 --> 03:23:59,030
I don't have any fucking money.

3151
03:23:59,030 --> 03:23:59,829
This team's terrible.

3152
03:24:00,549 --> 03:24:01,270
They're one in four.

3153
03:24:01,909 --> 03:24:04,559
You're going to go up against the Las Vegas.

3154
03:24:06,290 --> 03:24:07,250
What's the team name?

3155
03:24:07,250 --> 03:24:07,750
I forget.

3156
03:24:08,709 --> 03:24:11,750
We're playing the Cincinnati Crusaders this week.

3157
03:24:11,750 --> 03:24:12,629
Hallelujah.

3158
03:24:14,170 --> 03:24:17,370
Their best player by far is free safety Ezekiel Freeman.

3159
03:24:19,770 --> 03:24:22,600
Ezekiel could be playing division one ball,

3160
03:24:22,600 --> 03:24:25,000
but he claims God told him to be a Crusader.

3161
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:29,079
Come Sunday morning, he's reveling in the good book.

3162
03:24:29,639 --> 03:24:31,879
Sunday afternoon, he raises hell.

3163
03:24:35,270 --> 03:24:35,590
Okay.

3164
03:24:36,629 --> 03:24:37,430
So he's a safety.

3165
03:24:43,590 --> 03:24:44,870
Are you waiting for the Raiders?

3166
03:24:47,100 --> 03:24:48,299
No, not particularly.

3167
03:24:49,100 --> 03:24:50,540
That's going to be really interesting.

3168
03:24:51,260 --> 03:25:01,799
But I'm more of a baseball fan than I am a football fan.

3169
03:25:01,799 --> 03:25:06,920
So if Las Vegas gets itself a Las Vegas baseball team,

3170
03:25:07,479 --> 03:25:09,159
I'll be very, very excited.

3171
03:25:09,159 --> 03:25:11,989
All right, I have to make a 50 yard play.

3172
03:25:11,989 --> 03:25:22,620
That'll count for 50 yards.

3173
03:25:22,620 --> 03:25:23,020
I think.

3174
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:23,739
Oh, there he is.

3175
03:25:23,739 --> 03:25:25,500
The Crusader himself.

3176
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:26,459
Just shut it down.

3177
03:25:26,459 --> 03:25:27,500
God, come on.

3178
03:25:28,139 --> 03:25:31,659
He was a lightning bolt.

3179
03:25:31,659 --> 03:25:32,700
That was ridiculous.

3180
03:25:35,540 --> 03:25:36,500
That was so fast.

3181
03:25:36,739 --> 03:25:37,299
Where is he?

3182
03:25:37,299 --> 03:25:37,780
Top left.

3183
03:25:37,780 --> 03:25:38,659
He's the safety over there.

3184
03:25:48,200 --> 03:25:52,420
Hey, I'm supposed to be down there playing this game.

3185
03:25:52,420 --> 03:25:53,700
I really let myself go.

3186
03:25:54,420 --> 03:25:55,459
What happened to me?

3187
03:25:55,459 --> 03:25:56,819
I got to get away from that safety.

3188
03:25:56,819 --> 03:25:57,540
Let's go.

3189
03:25:57,540 --> 03:25:58,340
Let's go with a shimmy.

3190
03:25:59,059 --> 03:26:00,020
Two blockers on the right.

3191
03:26:00,819 --> 03:26:01,860
Try to go right between them.

3192
03:26:06,600 --> 03:26:09,000
Well, if you were there, that would have been a great run,

3193
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:09,639
but you weren't there.

3194
03:26:09,639 --> 03:26:10,760
He was just blocking that guy.

3195
03:26:11,879 --> 03:26:17,829
Let's see if I can get a hook.

3196
03:26:22,459 --> 03:26:23,979
He's so fast.

3197
03:26:24,139 --> 03:26:24,639
Got it.

3198
03:26:31,979 --> 03:26:32,780
Now, let's go for a run.

3199
03:26:33,819 --> 03:26:35,020
Shimmy, shimmy right again.

3200
03:26:35,020 --> 03:26:35,819
Let's go make a cross.

3201
03:26:40,649 --> 03:26:41,209
Oh, okay.

3202
03:26:42,250 --> 03:26:43,290
I was going to go for a juke.

3203
03:26:43,290 --> 03:26:43,770
Didn't get it.

3204
03:26:45,420 --> 03:26:45,979
Same deal.

3205
03:26:45,979 --> 03:26:46,780
Let's go right in the middle.

3206
03:26:46,780 --> 03:26:47,979
That wasn't very cordial.

3207
03:26:50,059 --> 03:26:51,260
No, right here.

3208
03:26:51,979 --> 03:26:52,780
Just go across.

3209
03:26:53,579 --> 03:26:57,190
Oh, shit.

3210
03:26:57,190 --> 03:26:58,549
I got stuffed.

3211
03:26:59,350 --> 03:27:00,469
I just got stuffed.

3212
03:27:12,409 --> 03:27:13,450
No two-pointer version.

3213
03:27:13,450 --> 03:27:14,409
Just get the field done.

3214
03:27:15,129 --> 03:27:27,559
As he gets Greg Caliendo in a booth

3215
03:27:27,559 --> 03:27:31,879
and tell him to do every John Madden stumble he's ever done.

3216
03:27:33,239 --> 03:27:38,500
Actual via.

3217
03:27:41,079 --> 03:27:41,559
Dirty hit.

3218
03:27:44,629 --> 03:27:45,350
All right.

3219
03:27:45,350 --> 03:27:46,149
Keep the defense up.

3220
03:27:48,600 --> 03:27:49,399
Lock it down.

3221
03:27:49,399 --> 03:27:51,159
He's not on offense.

3222
03:27:51,159 --> 03:27:52,440
So don't have to worry about it here.

3223
03:27:58,440 --> 03:27:58,940
Good play.

3224
03:28:00,040 --> 03:28:02,440
And that's the end of the first quarter

3225
03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:04,920
Las Vegas leads by seven.

3226
03:28:04,920 --> 03:28:06,280
What is that commentary?

3227
03:28:08,920 --> 03:28:09,719
It is very odd.

3228
03:28:12,139 --> 03:28:13,260
Oh, let's stay.

3229
03:28:13,260 --> 03:28:14,219
Let's stay back.

3230
03:28:14,219 --> 03:28:16,549
I feel like you're going for a pass play.

3231
03:28:24,200 --> 03:28:25,479
Magnetized to his back.

3232
03:28:27,260 --> 03:28:27,899
Third down.

3233
03:28:29,399 --> 03:28:29,879
You know what?

3234
03:28:29,879 --> 03:28:31,159
Just blitz them.

3235
03:28:31,159 --> 03:28:33,079
Defense will be coming here on third and long.

3236
03:28:34,549 --> 03:28:35,049
Get it.

3237
03:28:35,930 --> 03:28:36,430
Get it.

3238
03:28:39,959 --> 03:28:41,479
No, what a play they did to me.

3239
03:28:42,280 --> 03:28:46,780
Cincinnati gets some monster yardage on that play.

3240
03:28:46,780 --> 03:28:52,389
Defense in solid field position here inside the red zone.

3241
03:29:02,729 --> 03:29:11,239
There it is.

3242
03:29:11,239 --> 03:29:11,799
Broken neck.

3243
03:29:12,440 --> 03:29:12,920
What did I do?

3244
03:29:14,389 --> 03:29:15,909
No, he just went bent.

3245
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:27,959
That was a little more than I thought.

3246
03:29:29,459 --> 03:29:31,219
That was a helmet to skull.

3247
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:34,860
Sixth play of this drive.

3248
03:29:34,860 --> 03:29:35,360
Wow.

3249
03:29:36,920 --> 03:29:38,280
It's a neck and neck and two.

3250
03:29:44,879 --> 03:29:45,760
I was there.

3251
03:29:46,639 --> 03:29:47,680
I made the right play.

3252
03:29:48,639 --> 03:29:49,139
Watch this.

3253
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:53,500
Huh?

3254
03:29:54,860 --> 03:29:56,700
Keep the arm on this young man.

3255
03:29:56,700 --> 03:29:58,299
Not to mention the accuracy.

3256
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:04,659
Tug him.

3257
03:30:04,659 --> 03:30:05,920
And the extra point is good.

3258
03:30:05,920 --> 03:30:06,879
And that ties it up.

3259
03:30:08,399 --> 03:30:09,120
Jesus.

3260
03:30:09,120 --> 03:30:10,239
Jesus said so.

3261
03:30:14,559 --> 03:30:15,920
Nobody's got an unleashed meter.

3262
03:30:15,920 --> 03:30:17,899
So should be good.

3263
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:24,290
Mistake.

3264
03:30:25,149 --> 03:30:27,479
But still got me.

3265
03:30:29,870 --> 03:30:30,829
Son of a bitch.

3266
03:30:39,100 --> 03:30:39,819
Out of the way.

3267
03:30:40,940 --> 03:30:41,979
Just make it there.

3268
03:30:41,979 --> 03:30:42,540
You got it.

3269
03:30:43,340 --> 03:30:44,299
Don't do any taunting.

3270
03:30:45,020 --> 03:30:46,190
Just get it.

3271
03:30:46,190 --> 03:30:52,280
I think it's gonna be codes.

3272
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:55,559
I think he's got insurance.

3273
03:30:55,559 --> 03:30:56,059
I'm not.

3274
03:30:56,840 --> 03:30:57,479
Just get it.

3275
03:30:58,040 --> 03:30:58,540
Stay ahead.

3276
03:31:03,680 --> 03:31:04,239
Blocked it.

3277
03:31:04,239 --> 03:31:05,280
And the extra point is good.

3278
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:06,969
Is that a new sponsor?

3279
03:31:06,969 --> 03:31:07,770
Did I get the 50 yards?

3280
03:31:08,489 --> 03:31:10,860
I think I did, right?

3281
03:31:11,500 --> 03:31:24,840
He's gonna have a meter in a second.

3282
03:31:25,950 --> 03:31:26,670
So am I though.

3283
03:31:30,059 --> 03:31:31,020
That this guy's back in the game?

3284
03:31:38,430 --> 03:31:40,909
Oh, don't let him in there.

3285
03:31:40,909 --> 03:31:41,549
Knock him down.

3286
03:31:43,879 --> 03:31:45,079
See an ankle.

3287
03:31:45,079 --> 03:31:50,559
Oh, the fluid.

3288
03:31:51,200 --> 03:31:52,559
That frog fin.

3289
03:31:55,290 --> 03:31:56,489
That was a frog.

3290
03:31:56,489 --> 03:31:57,450
That wasn't even a person.

3291
03:32:00,729 --> 03:32:01,850
And that wasn't even an unleash.

3292
03:32:01,850 --> 03:32:02,489
I still have one.

3293
03:32:12,010 --> 03:32:12,969
Intercept him.

3294
03:32:12,969 --> 03:32:13,530
Perfect.

3295
03:32:13,530 --> 03:32:14,090
Turn it around.

3296
03:32:14,090 --> 03:32:14,489
Watch this.

3297
03:32:15,129 --> 03:32:15,629
Bingo.

3298
03:32:16,329 --> 03:32:22,219
Still have an unleash.

3299
03:32:27,690 --> 03:32:29,129
I still have an unleash.

3300
03:32:29,129 --> 03:32:29,930
I'm not gonna use it.

3301
03:32:37,450 --> 03:32:54,170
Nothing here.

3302
03:32:56,090 --> 03:32:58,780
The guy, I didn't want to throw it a square.

3303
03:32:58,780 --> 03:33:04,959
It was like, what the fuck?

3304
03:33:04,959 --> 03:33:05,440
Oh well.

3305
03:33:05,440 --> 03:33:05,840
It's okay.

3306
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:06,399
It's still up.

3307
03:33:06,399 --> 03:33:07,520
I still have an unleash.

3308
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:08,479
I'll get it back right now.

3309
03:33:11,739 --> 03:33:14,360
Give me that ball back.

3310
03:33:15,559 --> 03:33:23,840
I'm running the clock out.

3311
03:33:36,680 --> 03:33:38,889
Watch this guy on the left.

3312
03:33:38,889 --> 03:33:39,770
This guy's coming up.

3313
03:33:40,729 --> 03:33:43,500
How many does it take?

3314
03:33:44,219 --> 03:33:45,500
You're gonna have to do a timeout.

3315
03:33:46,139 --> 03:33:47,319
I don't see a timeout.

3316
03:33:47,319 --> 03:33:48,200
Do you have any timeouts?

3317
03:33:48,840 --> 03:33:49,319
I'll take it.

3318
03:33:50,120 --> 03:33:51,000
One second.

3319
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:51,719
Give me a break.

3320
03:33:54,569 --> 03:33:56,329
And with the first half of the books,

3321
03:33:56,329 --> 03:33:58,250
Las Vegas leads by seven.

3322
03:33:58,250 --> 03:34:00,889
Why would you not do a timeout here?

3323
03:34:00,889 --> 03:34:02,379
Did they not have any timeouts?

3324
03:34:03,739 --> 03:34:08,319
Oh, you just gave yourself worse position with the ball.

3325
03:34:10,540 --> 03:34:12,680
Unless he activates his thing.

3326
03:34:14,200 --> 03:34:15,000
Which he just did.

3327
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:15,879
Okay, this is not good.

3328
03:34:17,399 --> 03:34:22,190
That's a fumble, isn't it?

3329
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:32,680
All right, I thought he fumbled it.

3330
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:33,239
Apparently not.

3331
03:34:34,750 --> 03:34:35,950
First and 30.

3332
03:34:35,950 --> 03:34:36,750
This is not good.

3333
03:34:36,750 --> 03:34:37,709
They're gonna get it.

3334
03:34:37,709 --> 03:34:39,549
Unless I can get an interception or something or a good hit.

3335
03:34:41,549 --> 03:34:43,790
That was pretty good.

3336
03:34:49,020 --> 03:34:50,860
Building meter slowly.

3337
03:34:51,659 --> 03:34:56,969
Please don't hurt them.

3338
03:34:57,530 --> 03:34:58,329
Oh, I'm not hurting them.

3339
03:34:58,329 --> 03:34:58,649
They are.

3340
03:35:05,290 --> 03:35:05,770
How did you?

3341
03:35:06,489 --> 03:35:07,290
How did you?

3342
03:35:07,290 --> 03:35:08,489
He was right to you.

3343
03:35:09,610 --> 03:35:10,649
Get some more lotion ordered.

3344
03:35:10,649 --> 03:35:12,010
I'm doing hands no matter how much it is next.

3345
03:35:13,229 --> 03:35:15,049
Third and let's just call it third.

3346
03:35:15,049 --> 03:35:17,770
We're putting into a vigorous hand training.

3347
03:35:18,889 --> 03:35:20,059
Where's it going?

3348
03:35:26,799 --> 03:35:28,799
It's just salmon jumping out of water.

3349
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:32,860
They gotta kick a field goal.

3350
03:35:35,049 --> 03:35:41,389
They're going for a field goal right now.

3351
03:35:42,030 --> 03:35:42,510
I'll take it.

3352
03:35:42,510 --> 03:35:43,149
I'm still ahead.

3353
03:35:44,959 --> 03:35:46,409
Oh, shit.

3354
03:35:46,409 --> 03:35:47,129
Did I get it?

3355
03:35:47,129 --> 03:35:48,569
The field goal is good.

3356
03:35:48,569 --> 03:35:50,250
They're chipping away at the lead.

3357
03:35:50,250 --> 03:35:51,770
Can they come all the way back?

3358
03:35:54,590 --> 03:35:55,709
God, fuck.

3359
03:35:55,709 --> 03:36:02,729
All right, don't burn it.

3360
03:36:05,530 --> 03:36:07,870
He let go.

3361
03:36:08,829 --> 03:36:09,629
He had it up to him.

3362
03:36:15,760 --> 03:36:18,190
Let's go for a run to the left here.

3363
03:36:40,170 --> 03:36:41,370
What a catch that was.

3364
03:36:51,209 --> 03:36:53,370
That reception all the way into the end zone.

3365
03:36:53,370 --> 03:36:54,729
Nice yards after the catch.

3366
03:36:56,250 --> 03:36:58,479
I'm going for it.

3367
03:37:06,409 --> 03:37:07,370
Knees that bad.

3368
03:37:07,370 --> 03:37:08,729
The conversion is good.

3369
03:37:08,729 --> 03:37:09,530
Now the game's out of reach.

3370
03:37:10,569 --> 03:37:12,670
They never win.

3371
03:37:12,670 --> 03:37:28,700
22.

3372
03:37:29,479 --> 03:37:31,100
What do I have to win by?

3373
03:37:31,100 --> 03:37:31,979
No, I didn't make any bets.

3374
03:37:35,069 --> 03:37:35,549
Deep zones.

3375
03:37:35,549 --> 03:37:37,309
The offense looking at first and 30.

3376
03:37:39,319 --> 03:37:40,200
The Super Bowlers.

3377
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:41,719
They're about to win the Super Bowl.

3378
03:37:41,719 --> 03:37:42,360
Normal bowl.

3379
03:37:46,940 --> 03:37:47,819
That was a big hit.

3380
03:37:48,379 --> 03:37:49,340
10% stamina.

3381
03:37:50,059 --> 03:37:51,239
Back off, bitch.

3382
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:55,719
That was a good counter.

3383
03:37:57,850 --> 03:37:58,729
The normal bowl.

3384
03:38:01,879 --> 03:38:02,760
Let's do some jamming.

3385
03:38:05,069 --> 03:38:06,030
Watch this right side.

3386
03:38:06,909 --> 03:38:10,409
Las Vegas.

3387
03:38:10,409 --> 03:38:10,909
What?

3388
03:38:11,930 --> 03:38:14,409
Did I just scoop slam somebody and they dropped the ball?

3389
03:38:15,450 --> 03:38:18,959
Quite trailing late in the game and giving it up.

3390
03:38:20,959 --> 03:38:21,840
I need to see that again.

3391
03:38:21,840 --> 03:38:22,479
What happened here?

3392
03:38:23,200 --> 03:38:25,290
So he's he backs up.

3393
03:38:28,170 --> 03:38:32,479
Okay, so he just kind of flicks the ball

3394
03:38:33,280 --> 03:38:34,799
from his left hand.

3395
03:38:34,799 --> 03:38:36,319
I was supposed to go to the guy right in the middle

3396
03:38:36,319 --> 03:38:38,959
and I'm in the middle of doing like a slam to some guy.

3397
03:38:38,959 --> 03:38:39,760
That, what a hero.

3398
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:43,680
Not only does he belly to back soup like somebody,

3399
03:38:44,239 --> 03:38:45,440
he also recovers the football.

3400
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:50,260
Nice job.

3401
03:38:53,079 --> 03:38:53,579
QB.

3402
03:39:04,750 --> 03:39:05,250
That was quick.

3403
03:39:05,950 --> 03:39:07,260
Trick play.

3404
03:39:08,219 --> 03:39:09,360
Look at this one.

3405
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:10,479
Check this out.

3406
03:39:10,479 --> 03:39:11,600
This is going to be all over the place.

3407
03:39:18,750 --> 03:39:25,229
That was perfectly executed.

3408
03:39:32,510 --> 03:39:35,149
Even Crusader guy couldn't stop me.

3409
03:39:39,739 --> 03:39:42,719
Is he alive?

3410
03:39:44,319 --> 03:39:45,440
He actually got up.

3411
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:46,239
I'm very surprised.

3412
03:39:51,290 --> 03:39:54,170
Cincinnati needs to make this a scoring drive.

3413
03:39:56,299 --> 03:39:57,340
They are one and four.

3414
03:39:58,379 --> 03:40:00,719
Looks like a fumble.

3415
03:40:00,719 --> 03:40:02,799
Las Vegas comes up with the turnover.

3416
03:40:03,520 --> 03:40:04,479
Oh, I was trying to shoot him.

3417
03:40:04,479 --> 03:40:06,159
These fellows may have just seen their chances

3418
03:40:06,159 --> 03:40:08,000
of winning fly out the window.

3419
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:09,840
And so with three quarters gone,

3420
03:40:09,840 --> 03:40:11,920
Las Vegas leads by 20.

3421
03:40:15,159 --> 03:40:16,440
Hey, that is bullshit.

3422
03:40:17,479 --> 03:40:25,260
I got a play for you, buddy.

3423
03:40:25,260 --> 03:40:26,059
Under pressure.

3424
03:40:27,500 --> 03:40:28,620
And it's intercepted.

3425
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:32,940
Ezekiel Freeman is hard to stop once the QB's in his sights.

3426
03:40:32,940 --> 03:40:34,700
He does that game in and game out.

3427
03:40:34,700 --> 03:40:36,139
Just consistent, great play.

3428
03:40:36,780 --> 03:40:37,260
Why pass?

3429
03:40:49,319 --> 03:40:51,000
Passing on first and goal.

3430
03:40:52,120 --> 03:40:53,000
I was going to run,

3431
03:40:53,000 --> 03:40:54,760
but then I got scared because he had an unleash

3432
03:40:54,760 --> 03:40:56,360
and I was scared he was going to hurt my quarterback,

3433
03:40:56,360 --> 03:40:58,600
which is the main player of the campaign.

3434
03:40:58,600 --> 03:41:00,200
And I thought I was going to be up for like five games

3435
03:41:00,200 --> 03:41:01,559
and then I had panicked.

3436
03:41:01,559 --> 03:41:02,040
I panicked.

3437
03:41:02,040 --> 03:41:16,059
Oh, it was right.

3438
03:41:16,059 --> 03:41:16,559
Get them.

3439
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:20,280
What shitty hands.

3440
03:41:22,889 --> 03:41:24,569
Get a punt.

3441
03:41:24,569 --> 03:41:26,329
The receiver couldn't hang on to it.

3442
03:41:26,329 --> 03:41:26,969
You have to punt.

3443
03:41:31,079 --> 03:41:31,719
Fuck, how did I?

3444
03:41:31,719 --> 03:41:40,270
I thought I had the guy back there to receive the punt.

3445
03:41:40,270 --> 03:41:41,469
The 34 yard line.

3446
03:41:41,469 --> 03:41:43,549
And so they're forced to turn the ball over.

3447
03:41:43,549 --> 03:41:45,950
The offense not able to move the sticks this time.

3448
03:41:49,559 --> 03:41:51,399
First down, 30 yards to go.

3449
03:41:51,479 --> 03:41:53,559
Ball spotted at the 34 yard line.

3450
03:41:56,860 --> 03:41:57,340
Touchdown.

3451
03:41:57,340 --> 03:41:58,139
Thanks a lot.

3452
03:41:58,139 --> 03:41:58,860
Good job, Robbie.

3453
03:42:00,620 --> 03:42:01,120
Robbie.

3454
03:42:04,239 --> 03:42:05,840
A really outstanding run.

3455
03:42:05,840 --> 03:42:08,399
He blew past defenders and found some room to run.

3456
03:42:09,450 --> 03:42:10,090
Excellent work.

3457
03:42:11,479 --> 03:42:12,040
Robbie's good.

3458
03:42:12,680 --> 03:42:17,040
Let's take the field going.

3459
03:42:17,040 --> 03:42:18,000
No, we're so far ahead.

3460
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:18,500
Who cares?

3461
03:42:19,959 --> 03:42:21,079
No, I don't want to.

3462
03:42:21,079 --> 03:42:21,639
What are you doing?

3463
03:42:22,440 --> 03:42:23,610
I'm getting booed.

3464
03:42:24,250 --> 03:42:24,750
Whatever.

3465
03:42:25,209 --> 03:42:29,239
The extra point is good.

3466
03:42:29,959 --> 03:42:31,610
Is Robbie juicing?

3467
03:42:32,409 --> 03:42:34,409
I don't think Robbie's on drugs this game.

3468
03:42:35,450 --> 03:42:36,649
He was on drugs last game.

3469
03:42:37,209 --> 03:42:43,959
Let's go for an injury.

3470
03:42:52,989 --> 03:42:54,190
How's the ribs?

3471
03:42:54,190 --> 03:42:54,909
How do those feel?

3472
03:42:56,510 --> 03:42:57,600
Here we go.

3473
03:42:57,600 --> 03:42:58,079
Here we go.

3474
03:42:59,280 --> 03:42:59,760
Hold on, man.

3475
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:00,399
I'll give you a hand.

3476
03:43:00,399 --> 03:43:00,899
Come on.

3477
03:43:02,159 --> 03:43:04,920
You actually want to buy this?

3478
03:43:04,920 --> 03:43:05,639
I don't blame you.

3479
03:43:06,280 --> 03:43:10,200
It's a very, it's a very fun game regardless if it's a football game.

3480
03:43:12,379 --> 03:43:22,649
One of those franchises that kind of disappeared.

3481
03:43:29,870 --> 03:43:32,829
Because they did Blitz, Blitz the League, the Blitz 2.

3482
03:43:32,829 --> 03:43:33,950
It was in the arcades too.

3483
03:43:33,950 --> 03:43:36,829
Not this, but I remember Blitz being in the arcade.

3484
03:43:44,190 --> 03:43:50,030
I would love another Blitz from Midway, which then, which now turned into Netherrealm, right?

3485
03:43:50,909 --> 03:43:51,950
Or are they different companies?

3486
03:43:51,950 --> 03:43:52,450
No.

3487
03:44:06,649 --> 03:44:08,489
Owned by, does he own it?

3488
03:44:09,530 --> 03:44:16,459
I would love them to take a year off Mortal Kombat.

3489
03:44:17,180 --> 03:44:19,899
Okay, our new mantra is run the ball, burn the clock.

3490
03:44:19,899 --> 03:44:23,819
And make, well not a year, I mean like instead of a new Mortal Kombat cycle,

3491
03:44:23,819 --> 03:44:27,899
which is about 24 years sometimes, two years, that's wide open.

3492
03:44:27,899 --> 03:44:31,659
Looking for the big play and it's complete at the 30-yard line.

3493
03:44:31,659 --> 03:44:32,860
The ball comes loose.

3494
03:44:32,860 --> 03:44:37,260
Cincinnati makes the recovery and that hit drops him like a rock.

3495
03:44:39,290 --> 03:44:40,329
Every two years?

3496
03:44:40,329 --> 03:44:40,829
Yeah.

3497
03:44:42,329 --> 03:44:45,129
So they took a break from Mortal Kombat and made another Blitz.

3498
03:44:45,930 --> 03:44:47,450
Good, you good to go?

3499
03:44:50,239 --> 03:44:52,319
There was some great arcade sports games.

3500
03:44:52,959 --> 03:44:54,399
I don't like the simulation games.

3501
03:44:56,569 --> 03:44:57,889
Get up.

3502
03:44:58,670 --> 03:45:00,090
Don't let them have this.

3503
03:45:04,879 --> 03:45:08,399
Never gonna happen.

3504
03:45:09,120 --> 03:45:10,879
Yeah, there was the bigs, there was Blitz.

3505
03:45:11,920 --> 03:45:13,920
NBA Street was another amazing game.

3506
03:45:14,879 --> 03:45:18,000
Why do they only make these simulation games now?

3507
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:20,399
What happened to the fun arcade sports games?

3508
03:45:22,920 --> 03:45:24,729
Wait, has anybody made one?

3509
03:45:25,370 --> 03:45:29,739
The receiver never had a chance.

3510
03:45:29,739 --> 03:45:31,739
He got pummeled before the ball arrived.

3511
03:45:33,500 --> 03:45:34,299
Because of the licensing?

3512
03:45:34,299 --> 03:45:35,899
Well, there's no license for this game at all.

3513
03:45:37,879 --> 03:45:38,760
There's no NFL teams.

3514
03:45:38,760 --> 03:45:39,479
There's no license here.

3515
03:45:39,479 --> 03:45:40,360
These are all made up teams.

3516
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:50,280
Or should I say the defender got there early.

3517
03:45:50,280 --> 03:45:51,559
Big fourth down coming up.

3518
03:45:52,760 --> 03:45:54,559
They're not going to do it, are they?

3519
03:45:54,559 --> 03:45:55,760
We need to shut them down.

3520
03:45:56,399 --> 03:45:58,329
Nah, they are going for it.

3521
03:46:01,819 --> 03:46:04,299
NBA Street volume two is the best sports game ever made.

3522
03:46:05,100 --> 03:46:06,299
I might agree with you on that.

3523
03:46:06,299 --> 03:46:07,579
Feeling the rush.

3524
03:46:08,379 --> 03:46:09,629
Incomplete.

3525
03:46:09,629 --> 03:46:13,149
The quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender, I think.

3526
03:46:13,149 --> 03:46:14,350
That's fairly accurate.

3527
03:46:15,389 --> 03:46:17,129
That's a turnover.

3528
03:46:19,129 --> 03:46:20,729
First down, 30 yards to go.

3529
03:46:21,930 --> 03:46:22,489
Blood Bowl.

3530
03:46:26,969 --> 03:46:27,850
Eaves it deep.

3531
03:46:30,239 --> 03:46:31,360
Oh no, please don't catch that.

3532
03:46:32,079 --> 03:46:34,399
And the defender says nothing doing.

3533
03:46:34,399 --> 03:46:37,040
And so, Las Vegas will take this one.

3534
03:46:37,040 --> 03:46:39,600
Oh, I didn't even do any timeouts.

3535
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:40,239
It doesn't matter.

3536
03:46:40,239 --> 03:46:40,879
I went by a lot.

3537
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:43,920
Mario Strikers was a great soccer game.

3538
03:46:44,719 --> 03:46:45,219
It was.

3539
03:46:46,959 --> 03:46:51,120
All these games lived in like the PlayStation 3 Wii era.

3540
03:46:52,159 --> 03:46:53,280
PS2, PS3.

3541
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:54,719
Why has there been no none?

3542
03:46:56,000 --> 03:47:00,139
Next Gen has so much opportunity to make one of those.

3543
03:47:00,139 --> 03:47:01,260
And make them way better.

3544
03:47:02,590 --> 03:47:03,709
A new NBA Street.

3545
03:47:04,430 --> 03:47:08,040
Look at like the technology increases and the amount of things.

3546
03:47:08,040 --> 03:47:09,000
It'd be so much better.

3547
03:47:09,719 --> 03:47:11,200
Slogfest was awesome.

3548
03:47:11,840 --> 03:47:18,239
All right, we're going to get a cut scene.

3549
03:47:20,479 --> 03:47:21,920
Nice game you played today, kid.

3550
03:47:22,559 --> 03:47:22,959
Nice.

3551
03:47:23,840 --> 03:47:25,120
It was fucking awesome.

3552
03:47:26,159 --> 03:47:35,399
Sure thing, beautiful.

3553
03:47:35,399 --> 03:47:36,840
Where would you like for me to stand?

3554
03:47:37,879 --> 03:47:40,520
Don't undo it.

3555
03:47:40,520 --> 03:47:41,799
Hey, hold this, partner.

3556
03:47:43,319 --> 03:47:44,600
Hey, I want one too.

3557
03:47:44,600 --> 03:47:45,399
She a wraith.

3558
03:47:48,440 --> 03:47:52,889
Uh-oh, here comes the jealousy arc.

3559
03:47:53,770 --> 03:47:56,569
Oh, franchise, you're unstoppable.

3560
03:47:56,569 --> 03:47:59,450
Oh yeah, you just unstoppable.

3561
03:48:00,170 --> 03:48:01,049
Got that right.

3562
03:48:01,530 --> 03:48:02,649
Un-fucking-stoppable.

3563
03:48:02,649 --> 03:48:03,149
What the fuck?

3564
03:48:12,239 --> 03:48:13,040
Did this poison me?

3565
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:13,440
What was it?

3566
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:13,940
What happened?

3567
03:48:16,809 --> 03:48:17,850
Hey there, franchise.

3568
03:48:18,409 --> 03:48:20,090
I've been watching you since draft day.

3569
03:48:20,889 --> 03:48:22,889
You're good, but I can do things for you.

3570
03:48:22,889 --> 03:48:24,889
Your coaches and trainers can't.

3571
03:48:24,889 --> 03:48:26,409
Ask around in the locker room.

3572
03:48:26,409 --> 03:48:27,370
They'll know who I am.

3573
03:48:28,729 --> 03:48:30,969
Keep that body of yours healthy and I'll be in touch.

3574
03:48:32,010 --> 03:48:33,209
I can do things for you, okay?

3575
03:48:33,209 --> 03:48:34,170
Ask around in the locker room.

3576
03:48:34,170 --> 03:48:34,809
They'll know who I am.

3577
03:48:34,809 --> 03:48:35,370
Keep that.

3578
03:48:35,370 --> 03:48:35,870
All right.

3579
03:48:36,889 --> 03:48:38,409
What did I tell everyone?

3580
03:48:38,409 --> 03:48:41,850
I told them all that my main man delivers.

3581
03:48:41,850 --> 03:48:43,850
That was beautiful, franchise.

3582
03:48:43,850 --> 03:48:45,850
You and me, we're going to conquer the world.

3583
03:48:47,319 --> 03:48:48,360
Don't cheat on Kim.

3584
03:48:49,319 --> 03:48:49,959
I'm not gonna.

3585
03:48:55,389 --> 03:48:57,149
See, Kim's the only girlfriend.

3586
03:48:58,459 --> 03:48:59,340
New sponsor stuff.

3587
03:48:59,979 --> 03:49:00,620
Crazy grip.

3588
03:49:01,180 --> 03:49:02,360
Superior ball control.

3589
03:49:02,360 --> 03:49:03,239
I need more hands.

3590
03:49:03,239 --> 03:49:04,200
I told you that's what we're going to do.

3591
03:49:05,159 --> 03:49:06,040
First things first.

3592
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:09,100
Take my 276, go to hands.

3593
03:49:19,420 --> 03:49:21,979
Passing, I could make my passing better break.

3594
03:49:21,979 --> 03:49:27,850
Tackle, break tackle.

3595
03:49:29,719 --> 03:49:30,920
That means I just have to make more money.

3596
03:49:31,899 --> 03:49:35,100
I got to make $250, $260,000 right now.

3597
03:49:37,930 --> 03:49:38,649
Is there another image?

3598
03:49:45,950 --> 03:49:49,040
What the hell?

3599
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:49,760
That's amazing.

3600
03:49:50,639 --> 03:49:50,879
All right.

3601
03:49:50,879 --> 03:49:52,959
So we got training and everything's fine.

3602
03:49:54,270 --> 03:49:54,750
Juicing.

3603
03:49:55,709 --> 03:49:57,450
Let's go.

3604
03:49:57,450 --> 03:49:57,850
What do I got?

3605
03:49:57,850 --> 03:50:04,399
20,000 class drain by statement of loss to opponents.

3606
03:50:05,579 --> 03:50:06,059
No, no, no.

3607
03:50:06,540 --> 03:50:09,260
I want to give this to somebody on defense.

3608
03:50:09,979 --> 03:50:17,149
I mean, I am on defense, but do I get this on?

3609
03:50:17,950 --> 03:50:19,469
I get it on defense too, right?

3610
03:50:24,139 --> 03:50:27,020
Because I need to make tackles with myself.

3611
03:50:27,020 --> 03:50:29,659
Let's give Robbie something.

3612
03:50:32,379 --> 03:50:37,819
Reduce the chance of severity of injury sustained or stamina loss from tackles.

3613
03:50:37,819 --> 03:50:38,459
Let's go for it.

3614
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:43,239
All right.

3615
03:50:43,239 --> 03:50:45,559
This is against the Cleveland Steamers.

3616
03:50:46,649 --> 03:50:49,399
Currently 6-0.

3617
03:50:49,399 --> 03:50:49,799
We are.

3618
03:50:57,360 --> 03:51:02,090
We have increased our stats here pretty even.

3619
03:51:02,090 --> 03:51:03,530
Besides, I got a little bit better defense.

3620
03:51:04,170 --> 03:51:05,770
Got to win by more than 23 points.

3621
03:51:05,770 --> 03:51:07,370
I don't have any money, so don't bet at all.

3622
03:51:07,370 --> 03:51:09,579
Why 6-0?

3623
03:51:09,579 --> 03:51:10,379
Can we make it 7-0?

3624
03:51:12,639 --> 03:51:15,200
We play the Cleveland Steamers on Sunday.

3625
03:51:15,200 --> 03:51:19,360
The best player they've got is wide receiver extraordinaire, Henry Cho.

3626
03:51:19,360 --> 03:51:22,000
Cho is like the bad guy in a Hong Kong action movie.

3627
03:51:23,040 --> 03:51:27,500
Hong Kong action moves off video too.

3628
03:51:28,319 --> 03:51:32,680
Cho's got style, but he has one problem.

3629
03:51:33,079 --> 03:51:34,920
Half the team is doing his wire.

3630
03:51:35,719 --> 03:51:36,040
What?

3631
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:42,639
That's how you're going to end that?

3632
03:51:43,879 --> 03:51:44,200
Okay.

3633
03:51:45,680 --> 03:51:47,520
So wide receiver, a good thing I'm a safety.

3634
03:51:48,399 --> 03:52:04,200
Because obviously, you know, I can cover big play secondary and there's bad pass consistency.

3635
03:52:04,840 --> 03:52:10,489
Good evening and welcome.

3636
03:52:10,489 --> 03:52:12,889
Well, we all know what's at stake here for this team.

3637
03:52:12,889 --> 03:52:16,250
Another win and they're going to the division three championship.

3638
03:52:16,250 --> 03:52:17,209
Both teams are ready.

3639
03:52:17,209 --> 03:52:17,770
That's right.

3640
03:52:17,770 --> 03:52:18,649
Championship.

3641
03:52:18,649 --> 03:52:28,430
I got a championship incoming here on his head.

3642
03:52:30,030 --> 03:52:33,389
Right off the bat.

3643
03:52:34,030 --> 03:52:34,510
Two clips.

3644
03:52:34,510 --> 03:52:34,750
Good.

3645
03:52:35,879 --> 03:52:36,200
All right.

3646
03:52:36,200 --> 03:52:37,719
So I need to cover.

3647
03:52:39,549 --> 03:52:41,950
Where is that receiver?

3648
03:52:41,950 --> 03:52:42,750
Wide receiver, right?

3649
03:52:43,629 --> 03:52:46,200
I cannot let him catch a pass.

3650
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:46,680
That's him.

3651
03:52:49,719 --> 03:52:50,760
Pretty worthless enough.

3652
03:52:51,639 --> 03:52:58,559
There you go.

3653
03:52:59,600 --> 03:53:00,000
I got you.

3654
03:53:00,000 --> 03:53:00,479
I got you.

3655
03:53:00,479 --> 03:53:01,280
You don't think I'd see you?

3656
03:53:07,399 --> 03:53:08,280
Don't even give him a chance.

3657
03:53:11,870 --> 03:53:12,510
I know.

3658
03:53:12,510 --> 03:53:13,069
Shut up.

3659
03:53:16,280 --> 03:53:16,840
Thunderstorm.

3660
03:53:21,950 --> 03:53:22,270
Nothing.

3661
03:53:22,270 --> 03:53:25,549
That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.

3662
03:53:26,590 --> 03:53:27,149
Here comes the punt.

3663
03:53:28,350 --> 03:53:30,329
I get the ball.

3664
03:53:30,969 --> 03:53:33,319
Why does your team look like bubblegum?

3665
03:53:33,319 --> 03:53:35,479
Because I tried to make it my stupid colors.

3666
03:53:37,000 --> 03:53:40,200
It looks awful on the home and the away jersey.

3667
03:53:40,200 --> 03:53:41,319
It looks bad everywhere.

3668
03:53:43,389 --> 03:53:43,629
What?

3669
03:53:43,629 --> 03:53:47,799
Did he go through?

3670
03:53:47,799 --> 03:53:48,360
That's weird.

3671
03:53:49,399 --> 03:53:50,360
All right.

3672
03:53:50,360 --> 03:53:52,520
So he is not on the field anymore.

3673
03:53:58,860 --> 03:53:59,739
Pumping into each other.

3674
03:54:01,659 --> 03:54:02,459
Don't please.

3675
03:54:02,459 --> 03:54:03,020
Don't catch it.

3676
03:54:03,659 --> 03:54:04,139
No.

3677
03:54:04,139 --> 03:54:05,899
What the fuck did I do?

3678
03:54:05,899 --> 03:54:07,180
How is that such a bad throw?

3679
03:54:10,040 --> 03:54:10,520
Calm down.

3680
03:54:14,250 --> 03:54:14,889
No.

3681
03:54:14,889 --> 03:54:15,690
What the heck did I do?

3682
03:54:16,649 --> 03:54:22,590
Really?

3683
03:54:25,229 --> 03:54:34,680
Look at that play they just did to me.

3684
03:54:45,129 --> 03:54:45,770
Thank God.

3685
03:54:47,530 --> 03:54:49,049
He just sniffed on two people.

3686
03:54:49,049 --> 03:54:49,610
That's the guy.

3687
03:54:50,569 --> 03:54:53,440
Crucial series of downs here.

3688
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:54,479
Thankfully somebody caught him.

3689
03:55:05,420 --> 03:55:06,620
Stamina has been decreased.

3690
03:55:06,620 --> 03:55:07,100
He's at 80%.

3691
03:55:08,299 --> 03:55:11,520
I had my target.

3692
03:55:12,239 --> 03:55:13,120
I picked the target.

3693
03:55:16,110 --> 03:55:17,549
It's time to put him up for good.

3694
03:55:29,399 --> 03:55:29,879
Put him out.

3695
03:55:33,500 --> 03:55:34,059
Put him out.

3696
03:55:39,079 --> 03:55:39,719
Third and goal.

3697
03:55:40,520 --> 03:55:50,329
Not the fourth down.

3698
03:55:50,329 --> 03:55:52,170
And he's brought down at the eight yard line.

3699
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:53,049
Are you going to go for field goal?

3700
03:55:55,709 --> 03:55:56,670
I would assume probably.

3701
03:55:58,030 --> 03:55:58,190
Yeah.

3702
03:56:03,579 --> 03:56:05,100
And that's the end of the first quarter.

3703
03:56:05,100 --> 03:56:06,219
And we're scoreless.

3704
03:56:07,020 --> 03:56:11,209
Nice snap.

3705
03:56:12,250 --> 03:56:12,809
I don't know.

3706
03:56:12,809 --> 03:56:13,450
Goal line.

3707
03:56:14,409 --> 03:56:15,770
Special field goal block.

3708
03:56:16,809 --> 03:56:18,959
I can make it in there.

3709
03:56:23,469 --> 03:56:26,920
The field goal is good.

3710
03:56:27,719 --> 03:56:32,700
And a little more juice.

3711
03:56:39,420 --> 03:56:40,299
Touchdown incoming.

3712
03:56:41,100 --> 03:56:46,219
Blocked my unleash.

3713
03:56:46,219 --> 03:56:49,309
Dick.

3714
03:56:49,309 --> 03:56:55,260
I'm going for it.

3715
03:56:56,059 --> 03:56:59,370
See ya.

3716
03:57:09,920 --> 03:57:13,639
I had to go for that.

3717
03:57:15,000 --> 03:57:19,549
And I got a choke slam.

3718
03:57:25,760 --> 03:57:27,049
Nothing fancy.

3719
03:57:27,049 --> 03:57:38,940
Who gets the ball at the half?

3720
03:57:39,739 --> 03:57:48,319
Never in the bigs you can break the scoreboard.

3721
03:57:48,319 --> 03:57:48,879
Yeah.

3722
03:57:48,879 --> 03:57:49,920
You can do a lot of cool shit.

3723
03:58:01,760 --> 03:58:05,040
This is making me want to go back and play all those old.

3724
03:58:05,840 --> 03:58:06,840
All my old.

3725
03:58:06,840 --> 03:58:08,440
I mean like 10 years, 12 years.

3726
03:58:08,440 --> 03:58:09,079
Not that old.

3727
03:58:12,680 --> 03:58:14,959
Catch that.

3728
03:58:16,639 --> 03:58:17,040
I don't know.

3729
03:58:17,040 --> 03:58:17,760
That was inhuman.

3730
03:58:19,120 --> 03:58:28,989
No game.

3731
03:58:33,229 --> 03:58:38,120
Bigs didn't have a story mode.

3732
03:58:38,120 --> 03:58:39,000
Yeah, this is weird.

3733
03:58:39,000 --> 03:58:40,760
It has takes itself.

3734
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:43,479
What the fuck?

3735
03:58:45,799 --> 03:58:48,040
I would have had it too if I wasn't trying to get a sack.

3736
03:58:48,040 --> 03:58:50,840
An opening in the defense for some real yardage on that play.

3737
03:58:50,840 --> 03:58:52,520
Big series of downs upcoming.

3738
03:58:53,399 --> 03:58:54,520
I thought I could have sacked him.

3739
03:58:54,520 --> 03:58:55,159
It was a risk.

3740
03:58:57,239 --> 03:59:07,469
Okay.

3741
03:59:08,590 --> 03:59:09,309
Second and goal.

3742
03:59:23,559 --> 03:59:28,409
I'm going to stay hydrated.

3743
03:59:28,409 --> 03:59:28,729
I agree.

3744
03:59:29,850 --> 03:59:33,770
Drink one glass of water per eight ounces of activity.

3745
03:59:34,409 --> 03:59:36,159
Third down.

3746
03:59:46,280 --> 03:59:46,780
Got it.

3747
03:59:48,200 --> 03:59:48,700
What?

3748
04:00:09,629 --> 04:00:10,670
That was insane.

3749
04:00:13,290 --> 04:00:14,909
I can't fucking believe that.

3750
04:00:19,979 --> 04:00:20,700
Tackled him.

3751
04:00:20,700 --> 04:00:23,739
He fumbled the ball to a teammate that was standing in the end zone.

3752
04:00:24,860 --> 04:00:26,520
Sorry, I was still in the game.

3753
04:00:27,319 --> 04:00:28,200
I got timeouts.

3754
04:00:28,920 --> 04:00:32,510
Nobody just decides to go get that.

3755
04:00:34,590 --> 04:00:39,950
That was a waste of an unleash because it didn't do anything.

3756
04:00:52,799 --> 04:00:54,559
Oh, eat shit video game.

3757
04:01:02,170 --> 04:01:02,969
Big play.

3758
04:01:03,930 --> 04:01:05,049
Field goal.

3759
04:01:05,049 --> 04:01:05,770
Field goal.

3760
04:01:05,770 --> 04:01:06,409
Just stay ahead.

3761
04:01:19,850 --> 04:01:21,209
The steamers eat shit.

3762
04:01:22,010 --> 04:01:22,969
We'll have one attempt here.

3763
04:01:24,569 --> 04:01:26,170
They don't have an unleash, do they?

3764
04:01:26,170 --> 04:01:26,670
No.

3765
04:01:27,129 --> 04:01:28,090
They have nothing actually.

3766
04:01:28,090 --> 04:01:28,889
They're not going to get anywhere.

3767
04:01:30,170 --> 04:01:31,610
That'd be a good injury opportunity.

3768
04:01:32,489 --> 04:01:36,409
I got like one or two plays.

3769
04:01:39,420 --> 04:01:41,260
Just watch that receiver.

3770
04:01:41,260 --> 04:01:41,899
Double coverage.

3771
04:01:42,459 --> 04:01:43,420
Don't let him get anywhere.

3772
04:01:53,950 --> 04:01:55,309
Robbie is my MVP.

3773
04:01:55,309 --> 04:01:55,809
Yeah.

3774
04:01:57,069 --> 04:01:58,270
I can see that.

3775
04:02:03,680 --> 04:02:04,000
All right.

3776
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:04,879
No, I'm staying back.

3777
04:02:05,840 --> 04:02:07,370
Then you can pass it all you want.

3778
04:02:07,370 --> 04:02:07,870
You got nothing here.

3779
04:02:30,159 --> 04:02:32,780
I fucking can't believe that shit.

3780
04:02:32,780 --> 04:02:34,780
What the hell happened there?

3781
04:02:37,149 --> 04:02:38,190
You've got to be kidding me.

3782
04:02:40,190 --> 04:02:40,750
What?

3783
04:02:40,750 --> 04:02:41,309
I want to see it.

3784
04:02:41,309 --> 04:02:41,790
What happened?

3785
04:02:42,430 --> 04:02:43,389
How did he even get that?

3786
04:02:44,670 --> 04:02:51,870
All right.

3787
04:02:51,870 --> 04:02:53,149
We're going to have to talk about this, guys.

3788
04:02:53,149 --> 04:02:54,670
About this stupid nudge.

3789
04:02:58,110 --> 04:03:00,430
Sorry, I'm not going to have that happen.

3790
04:03:01,790 --> 04:03:08,010
Let's go with the sizzle.

3791
04:03:10,399 --> 04:03:11,120
Steamers.

3792
04:03:16,520 --> 04:03:18,200
And the ball gets there too late.

3793
04:03:18,200 --> 04:03:20,360
Or should I say the defender got there early.

3794
04:03:20,360 --> 04:03:22,120
This screamer is steaming mad.

3795
04:03:35,840 --> 04:03:37,120
I'm getting really unlucky here.

3796
04:03:37,120 --> 04:03:40,559
All these turnovers are a main reason why these guys are losing side of this game.

3797
04:03:40,559 --> 04:03:40,959
Unlucky.

3798
04:03:40,959 --> 04:03:42,079
I got a first and goal.

3799
04:03:42,079 --> 04:03:43,360
It's gut check time.

3800
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:45,040
Ball at the 17 yard line.

3801
04:03:59,290 --> 04:04:00,569
This is my house.

3802
04:04:00,569 --> 04:04:01,530
This is my house.

3803
04:04:05,440 --> 04:04:06,479
Look, I'm going to do this shit again.

3804
04:04:07,120 --> 04:04:16,270
Play third down.

3805
04:04:20,110 --> 04:04:20,590
Watch this.

3806
04:04:22,110 --> 04:04:22,909
Watch this shit.

3807
04:04:22,909 --> 04:04:23,229
You're done.

3808
04:04:37,290 --> 04:04:38,969
No, I'm 6 and 0 right now.

3809
04:04:39,770 --> 04:04:40,409
It's a fake.

3810
04:04:41,209 --> 04:04:48,120
That's the best possible thing that could have happened.

3811
04:04:48,920 --> 04:05:00,719
Choke slam.

3812
04:05:03,049 --> 04:05:03,450
No!

3813
04:05:03,450 --> 04:05:04,090
Wrong button!

3814
04:05:04,090 --> 04:05:04,489
Get up!

3815
04:05:05,450 --> 04:05:07,209
Oh, I was trying to circle.

3816
04:05:07,850 --> 04:05:09,129
God damn it.

3817
04:05:09,129 --> 04:05:10,409
I'm so angry about that.

3818
04:05:11,690 --> 04:05:12,809
That was a touchdown right there.

3819
04:05:12,809 --> 04:05:14,090
And I had to press square.

3820
04:05:14,090 --> 04:05:14,969
I was trying to press circle.

3821
04:05:21,950 --> 04:05:23,309
Las Vegas gets it back.

3822
04:05:27,420 --> 04:05:28,299
I'm not doing that again.

3823
04:05:29,100 --> 04:05:29,819
Get it to Robbie.

3824
04:05:30,540 --> 04:05:31,260
He knows what to do.

3825
04:05:38,879 --> 04:05:40,079
Get it to Robbie every time.

3826
04:05:48,170 --> 04:05:48,889
Same thing, Robbie.

3827
04:05:48,889 --> 04:05:49,290
You do it.

3828
04:05:49,290 --> 04:05:51,290
My friend's trying to punch an 8 here.

3829
04:05:51,290 --> 04:05:52,090
Robbie, same deal.

3830
04:05:53,450 --> 04:05:58,729
Let's get it to Robbie every time.

3831
04:05:58,729 --> 04:06:01,290
They're not there yet catching up.

3832
04:06:01,930 --> 04:06:07,790
That was a hit!

3833
04:06:08,430 --> 04:06:10,430
I don't see any new kids in his future.

3834
04:06:11,149 --> 04:06:11,649
Get in there.

3835
04:06:22,030 --> 04:06:23,549
What's with all the fumbles?

3836
04:06:24,030 --> 04:06:26,670
Oh, I so badly need to upgrade those hands.

3837
04:06:27,229 --> 04:06:28,909
I should have just kept the money.

3838
04:06:29,709 --> 04:06:30,750
I should have saved the money.

3839
04:06:31,549 --> 04:06:37,709
That's like the third fumble I've done in this game.

3840
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:45,370
Still plenty of football.

3841
04:06:50,200 --> 04:06:51,399
It's because of the rain?

3842
04:06:51,399 --> 04:06:52,520
Yeah, but where's their fumble?

3843
04:06:55,819 --> 04:06:58,219
Got it.

3844
04:06:58,840 --> 04:07:00,520
Fucking can't be serious.

3845
04:07:00,520 --> 04:07:01,639
I tried to select him.

3846
04:07:02,600 --> 04:07:04,360
Apparently, he wasn't the closest person.

3847
04:07:05,159 --> 04:07:06,920
I would have selected him and pressed triangle.

3848
04:07:15,469 --> 04:07:16,510
Bringing his man down.

3849
04:07:16,510 --> 04:07:17,870
That was a questionable hit.

3850
04:07:21,049 --> 04:07:23,850
If I get a conversion here, then I'm on a good spot.

3851
04:07:24,409 --> 04:07:25,530
I can't get a first down here.

3852
04:07:34,430 --> 04:07:34,909
All right.

3853
04:07:34,909 --> 04:07:35,549
Played smart.

3854
04:07:36,510 --> 04:07:38,700
I was just going to do Hail Mary.

3855
04:07:38,700 --> 04:07:39,659
That would not be smart.

3856
04:07:41,120 --> 04:07:42,479
First down and 30.

3857
04:07:44,079 --> 04:07:59,469
Got it.

3858
04:07:59,469 --> 04:07:59,950
It's okay.

3859
04:07:59,950 --> 04:08:01,709
I got like four blips for that.

3860
04:08:02,909 --> 04:08:04,110
I really, really need those.

3861
04:08:04,989 --> 04:08:08,510
Look at that.

3862
04:08:08,510 --> 04:08:09,950
I almost have a full meter again.

3863
04:08:09,950 --> 04:08:13,840
Let's get it out of range of field goal.

3864
04:08:14,639 --> 04:08:15,360
Just get a field goal.

3865
04:08:15,360 --> 04:08:17,920
Then I got to get the ball back with my meter.

3866
04:08:25,399 --> 04:08:28,409
I've watched more of this today than the actual Super Bowl.

3867
04:08:33,690 --> 04:08:34,649
This is a pretty cool game.

3868
04:08:39,579 --> 04:08:40,780
Thank you for joining me.

3869
04:08:40,780 --> 04:08:44,750
Those of you that are in post Super Bowl mode right now.

3870
04:08:44,750 --> 04:08:45,389
If you've watched.

3871
04:08:47,180 --> 04:08:47,979
Get that fumble!

3872
04:08:47,979 --> 04:08:48,620
Get that fumble!

3873
04:08:49,579 --> 04:08:50,139
Who's got it?

3874
04:08:51,180 --> 04:08:55,819
Look at how far back we are though.

3875
04:08:56,700 --> 04:09:00,600
I got a full meter.

3876
04:09:00,600 --> 04:09:01,639
I'm going to get this ball back.

3877
04:09:01,639 --> 04:09:03,319
I'm going to go touch down right here.

3878
04:09:03,319 --> 04:09:04,360
Look at how far the ball is.

3879
04:09:06,489 --> 04:09:07,530
He has it unleashed as well.

3880
04:09:08,170 --> 04:09:11,950
All right.

3881
04:09:11,950 --> 04:09:13,229
That's a good spot to be in.

3882
04:09:13,870 --> 04:09:18,040
Do I let the receiver catch it and try to hurt him?

3883
04:09:18,040 --> 04:09:19,440
He wasted it.

3884
04:09:20,719 --> 04:09:23,260
Fumble.

3885
04:09:28,860 --> 04:09:29,180
Okay.

3886
04:09:30,700 --> 04:09:32,489
Unfortunate but okay.

3887
04:09:34,649 --> 04:09:35,129
Honda!

3888
04:09:35,129 --> 04:09:35,610
Honda!

3889
04:09:35,610 --> 04:09:36,010
Honda!

3890
04:09:36,809 --> 04:09:39,770
It's a big hit.

3891
04:09:40,809 --> 04:09:42,489
Where are my points for this?

3892
04:09:43,129 --> 04:09:44,409
How come I'm not getting any meter?

3893
04:09:44,409 --> 04:09:45,129
Those aren't dirty.

3894
04:09:46,010 --> 04:09:51,579
Apparently they're not dirty enough.

3895
04:09:54,000 --> 04:09:57,639
Fourth down.

3896
04:09:57,639 --> 04:09:58,680
What do you got?

3897
04:09:58,680 --> 04:09:58,920
One minute.

3898
04:09:58,920 --> 04:10:01,399
Defender made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch.

3899
04:10:01,399 --> 04:10:02,680
Are they going to punt or are they going to go for it?

3900
04:10:05,579 --> 04:10:05,739
No.

3901
04:10:05,739 --> 04:10:06,219
They're punting.

3902
04:10:06,780 --> 04:10:11,579
If I get a touchdown here the game is going to be fairly out of reach.

3903
04:10:13,440 --> 04:10:14,559
And then I'll be seven and up.

3904
04:10:15,850 --> 04:10:18,700
No meter.

3905
04:10:18,700 --> 04:10:20,459
So I'm just going to get a solid run here.

3906
04:10:24,459 --> 04:10:30,459
That is bullshit.

3907
04:10:31,100 --> 04:10:32,459
Oh I got to play for you buddy.

3908
04:10:34,219 --> 04:10:34,700
First down.

3909
04:10:34,700 --> 04:10:35,340
Let's get it to Robbie.

3910
04:10:35,340 --> 04:10:35,819
30 yards to go.

3911
04:10:38,600 --> 04:10:43,049
Oh no.

3912
04:10:43,610 --> 04:10:45,450
Okay.

3913
04:10:45,450 --> 04:10:46,250
It's nothing serious.

3914
04:10:46,969 --> 04:10:47,450
It is though.

3915
04:10:55,049 --> 04:10:55,930
That was really good.

3916
04:10:56,809 --> 04:10:58,090
Only have three plays.

3917
04:10:58,090 --> 04:10:58,889
Three standard hits.

3918
04:11:02,569 --> 04:11:04,170
This dude is out every game.

3919
04:11:04,170 --> 04:11:05,450
Oh no!

3920
04:11:05,450 --> 04:11:06,649
Please tell me that wasn't.

3921
04:11:07,610 --> 04:11:09,129
He gets injured every single game.

3922
04:11:10,569 --> 04:11:18,649
Steve is taking the time out.

3923
04:11:19,530 --> 04:11:20,829
Third and 13.

3924
04:11:21,709 --> 04:11:22,840
Hmm.

3925
04:11:26,909 --> 04:11:27,469
Lightning.

3926
04:11:36,600 --> 04:11:38,799
Bastards.

3927
04:11:38,799 --> 04:11:39,840
Am I in field goal range?

3928
04:11:40,479 --> 04:11:40,959
My three.

3929
04:11:42,799 --> 04:11:43,600
Field goal?

3930
04:11:43,600 --> 04:11:44,399
How close am I?

3931
04:11:45,360 --> 04:11:47,180
I can get it.

3932
04:11:57,100 --> 04:11:57,659
No good.

3933
04:11:58,459 --> 04:12:00,090
That's no good.

3934
04:12:04,799 --> 04:12:06,000
That was a perfect kick.

3935
04:12:06,000 --> 04:12:06,559
What happened?

3936
04:12:08,600 --> 04:12:16,329
It didn't aim.

3937
04:12:16,329 --> 04:12:18,170
I thought the game aims for you doesn't it?

3938
04:12:20,280 --> 04:12:21,719
I don't think you can even aim it can you?

3939
04:12:26,940 --> 04:12:27,500
Shit.

3940
04:12:31,200 --> 04:12:32,430
He's got an unleash.

3941
04:12:32,430 --> 04:12:33,950
This is not this is very very bad.

3942
04:12:34,909 --> 04:12:38,889
Well there was no kicking tutorial.

3943
04:12:44,219 --> 04:12:44,860
Come on.

3944
04:12:44,860 --> 04:12:46,459
He jumped over the ball.

3945
04:12:47,180 --> 04:12:48,459
He jumped over the ball.

3946
04:12:51,819 --> 04:12:54,059
This is where I put the game away right here.

3947
04:12:54,059 --> 04:12:55,100
I can do nothing.

3948
04:12:55,100 --> 04:12:55,979
Just stay in the zone.

3949
04:12:55,979 --> 04:12:56,860
Outside of the zone.

3950
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:57,340
In the zone.

3951
04:12:57,340 --> 04:12:57,899
Get in the zone.

3952
04:13:03,850 --> 04:13:04,170
Fuck.

3953
04:13:06,409 --> 04:13:08,489
That was an unleash catch.

3954
04:13:10,329 --> 04:13:12,250
Oh bad bad bad.

3955
04:13:12,250 --> 04:13:12,729
Come on.

3956
04:13:13,370 --> 04:13:13,850
Defense.

3957
04:13:18,270 --> 04:13:19,120
No!

3958
04:13:19,120 --> 04:13:19,440
What?

3959
04:13:19,440 --> 04:13:20,319
How do you catch it?

3960
04:13:20,959 --> 04:13:21,920
How is that possible?

3961
04:13:24,889 --> 04:13:25,850
Right up your ass.

3962
04:13:26,649 --> 04:13:27,850
I was right up your ass.

3963
04:13:27,850 --> 04:13:28,569
I can't believe it.

3964
04:13:29,370 --> 04:13:32,280
Why did I just do that?

3965
04:13:33,159 --> 04:13:36,670
I just tipped it.

3966
04:13:37,469 --> 04:13:38,670
I just tipped.

3967
04:13:38,670 --> 04:13:39,870
I just timed up.

3968
04:13:39,870 --> 04:13:41,469
That's not what I wanted to do though.

3969
04:13:41,469 --> 04:13:44,620
So game over.

3970
04:13:44,620 --> 04:13:46,940
Out of bounds.

3971
04:13:58,969 --> 04:13:59,850
I'm fucking believable.

3972
04:13:59,850 --> 04:14:00,409
I gotta make this.

3973
04:14:00,409 --> 04:14:01,049
I gotta have it happen.

3974
04:14:01,850 --> 04:14:03,579
Seven.

3975
04:14:03,579 --> 04:14:03,899
28.

3976
04:14:03,899 --> 04:14:04,379
29.

3977
04:14:04,379 --> 04:14:04,700
30.

3978
04:14:04,700 --> 04:14:05,180
I just need.

3979
04:14:05,979 --> 04:14:07,469
I gotta run it back for a touchdown.

3980
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:14,159
No.

3981
04:14:14,799 --> 04:14:15,440
I can't do it.

3982
04:14:16,239 --> 04:14:18,170
I have to run it back.

3983
04:14:18,170 --> 04:14:18,809
I have no meter.

3984
04:14:19,450 --> 04:14:22,170
I have to instantly run out of bounds.

3985
04:14:32,319 --> 04:14:32,799
Okay.

3986
04:14:32,799 --> 04:14:33,600
Okay.

3987
04:14:33,600 --> 04:14:33,920
All right.

3988
04:14:33,920 --> 04:14:34,799
Let's go.

3989
04:14:34,799 --> 04:14:35,280
Let's go.

3990
04:14:41,639 --> 04:14:43,479
I just hiccuped and almost threw up.

3991
04:14:43,479 --> 04:14:43,719
Okay.

3992
04:14:43,719 --> 04:14:44,200
Here we go.

3993
04:14:57,149 --> 04:14:58,909
Oh my first loss this season.

3994
04:15:02,200 --> 04:15:07,819
I gave them a timeout.

3995
04:15:10,350 --> 04:15:12,670
Hey, but my character was like poisoned, right?

3996
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:13,950
So that's why he wasn't as good.

3997
04:15:18,799 --> 04:15:19,280
It's scripted.

3998
04:15:19,280 --> 04:15:20,879
I'm supposed to lose that one.

3999
04:15:20,879 --> 04:15:29,600
Uh-oh.

4000
04:15:29,600 --> 04:15:32,639
Do I answer this call?

4001
04:15:37,920 --> 04:15:39,040
I got the championship.

4002
04:15:48,799 --> 04:15:51,360
We'll put Damon in his place during this game.

4003
04:15:51,360 --> 04:15:52,079
Okay.

4004
04:15:52,079 --> 04:15:53,840
I got to land a dirty hit on Damon

4005
04:15:53,840 --> 04:15:55,200
during the division three championship.

4006
04:15:55,200 --> 04:15:56,159
This is the championship game.

4007
04:15:56,159 --> 04:15:58,969
I made it to the championship versus the Hunts.

4008
04:16:00,440 --> 04:16:01,159
All right.

4009
04:16:01,159 --> 04:16:01,559
I don't know.

4010
04:16:01,559 --> 04:16:03,159
I guess everyone's on drugs this game.

4011
04:16:04,280 --> 04:16:05,020
How are we doing?

4012
04:16:05,659 --> 04:16:07,389
Somebody's a broken neck.

4013
04:16:08,030 --> 04:16:08,430
All right.

4014
04:16:08,430 --> 04:16:09,870
I gotta take a bunch of drugs.

4015
04:16:10,750 --> 04:16:14,000
Regenerate two stamina each play that they're on the field.

4016
04:16:14,799 --> 04:16:15,040
Yep.

4017
04:16:17,739 --> 04:16:18,139
Robbie.

4018
04:16:19,020 --> 04:16:26,000
Resistant to injury and wide receiver.

4019
04:16:26,559 --> 04:16:28,670
Shepherd is going to take.

4020
04:16:34,649 --> 04:16:36,489
Removes the cooldown effect from clash.

4021
04:16:37,049 --> 04:16:40,110
No, you're going to take a turbo bar terrain.

4022
04:16:40,829 --> 04:16:43,290
Good luck, everybody.

4023
04:16:43,850 --> 04:16:48,139
This is the championship game.

4024
04:16:48,780 --> 04:16:55,049
Look at how much better of a team I am.

4025
04:16:56,090 --> 04:16:56,649
Max bet.

4026
04:16:56,649 --> 04:16:58,090
It's the fucking goddamn Super Bowl.

4027
04:16:58,090 --> 04:16:59,129
Win by 16 points.

4028
04:16:59,129 --> 04:17:00,489
I'm going to just, I'm going to crush them.

4029
04:17:08,430 --> 04:17:08,670
Yeah.

4030
04:17:08,670 --> 04:17:09,870
You can only take three drugs at a time.

4031
04:17:13,610 --> 04:17:15,129
I wasn't poisoned last game.

4032
04:17:15,129 --> 04:17:15,690
I'm ready to go.

4033
04:17:16,559 --> 04:17:17,040
This is it.

4034
04:17:17,600 --> 04:17:21,389
It's the quarterback.

4035
04:17:21,389 --> 04:17:22,989
I got to land a hit on the quarterback.

4036
04:17:28,879 --> 04:17:29,920
Only three drugs.

4037
04:17:29,920 --> 04:17:30,319
What is this?

4038
04:17:30,319 --> 04:17:30,799
Oblivion?

4039
04:17:32,440 --> 04:17:33,000
Hello, everybody.

4040
04:17:33,000 --> 04:17:33,959
I got to land a hit on Conrad Daniels.

4041
04:17:33,959 --> 04:17:37,000
I'm excited to bring you the division three championship game.

4042
04:17:37,000 --> 04:17:38,440
Now I'd like to throw it over to my colleague.

4043
04:17:38,440 --> 04:17:39,639
By the way, this is like the Pee-wee leagues.

4044
04:17:39,639 --> 04:17:41,639
I don't know about you, but I'm ready to watch the football.

4045
04:17:41,639 --> 04:17:44,360
I mean, guys brought in the ball and other guys trying to attack.

4046
04:17:44,360 --> 04:17:46,200
This is the division three Pee-wee Super Bowl.

4047
04:17:46,760 --> 04:17:51,870
In that case, they tried to tackle the guy.

4048
04:17:51,870 --> 04:17:52,510
Nice start.

4049
04:17:52,510 --> 04:17:53,010
8%.

4050
04:17:53,870 --> 04:18:01,959
Am I dropping frames?

4051
04:18:02,680 --> 04:18:04,459
What the hell?

4052
04:18:04,459 --> 04:18:05,340
Shouldn't be happening.

4053
04:18:06,139 --> 04:18:06,379
All right.

4054
04:18:06,379 --> 04:18:08,700
So this is the, it's the quarterback that I need to work on.

4055
04:18:08,700 --> 04:18:10,059
First down and 30.

4056
04:18:10,059 --> 04:18:11,340
He's a very good quarterback.

4057
04:18:11,340 --> 04:18:12,219
It's gonna be hard to do that.

4058
04:18:12,459 --> 04:18:17,719
That was a good fucking pass.

4059
04:18:18,760 --> 04:18:20,940
He just got him by goddamn weight.

4060
04:18:22,360 --> 04:18:22,680
Get him.

4061
04:18:23,319 --> 04:18:24,680
You're not going to actually.

4062
04:18:24,680 --> 04:18:27,479
Who's, who's foot is that?

4063
04:18:28,120 --> 04:18:29,319
Is that my foot?

4064
04:18:30,200 --> 04:18:30,520
What?

4065
04:18:31,159 --> 04:18:32,520
What happened to me?

4066
04:18:33,159 --> 04:18:33,479
Why?

4067
04:18:53,719 --> 04:18:55,559
That's unfucking believable.

4068
04:18:55,559 --> 04:18:56,120
He'll be back.

4069
04:18:56,680 --> 04:19:05,200
I lost to a poop joke.

4070
04:19:05,200 --> 04:19:09,120
That's so, oh, what a, what a dog shit.

4071
04:19:09,120 --> 04:19:09,920
That's unbelievable.

4072
04:19:14,319 --> 04:19:16,379
How did you do that?

4073
04:19:17,100 --> 04:19:18,940
His first is a straw.

4074
04:19:19,739 --> 04:19:21,659
Oh, I know I'm behind already.

4075
04:19:22,620 --> 04:19:24,219
First goddamn exchange.

4076
04:19:25,500 --> 04:19:26,860
I'm going to lose the championship.

4077
04:19:31,340 --> 04:19:32,299
Oh, what is he doing?

4078
04:19:37,309 --> 04:19:43,069
Oh, that was so fucking funny.

4079
04:19:43,069 --> 04:19:50,430
First and 30.

4080
04:19:50,430 --> 04:19:55,100
He lets it fly at the 12 yard line.

4081
04:19:55,100 --> 04:19:55,739
It's okay.

4082
04:19:55,739 --> 04:19:56,620
That was a beautiful play.

4083
04:20:00,639 --> 04:20:01,040
Red zone.

4084
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:01,760
We're going to go for a run.

4085
04:20:02,719 --> 04:20:03,360
Power it in there.

4086
04:20:03,360 --> 04:20:05,120
Offense goes into their red zone package.

4087
04:20:09,819 --> 04:20:10,379
No, what?

4088
04:20:11,819 --> 04:20:13,819
Didn't I take resistant drugs?

4089
04:20:14,379 --> 04:20:16,219
Why is everybody getting hurt?

4090
04:20:16,219 --> 04:20:17,100
Shattered tibia.

4091
04:20:20,299 --> 04:20:22,379
Everybody took too many drugs.

4092
04:20:22,459 --> 04:20:23,260
Last game.

4093
04:20:23,260 --> 04:20:25,899
So now they're all fucked up because they're on drugs.

4094
04:20:30,959 --> 04:20:32,559
It's going to be a miracle if I win this game.

4095
04:20:33,200 --> 04:20:34,239
I don't even know what to say.

4096
04:20:35,040 --> 04:20:37,440
Speaking of disaster, let's might as well just do it.

4097
04:20:41,399 --> 04:20:41,879
Bingo.

4098
04:20:42,600 --> 04:20:43,079
Got it.

4099
04:20:43,079 --> 04:20:43,719
Pop.

4100
04:20:43,719 --> 04:20:44,120
I'll take it.

4101
04:20:44,120 --> 04:20:44,680
That's fine.

4102
04:20:44,680 --> 04:20:45,719
What a beautiful pass.

4103
04:20:45,719 --> 04:20:55,549
You see that spiral?

4104
04:20:55,549 --> 04:20:57,870
I can't throw a spiral for the life of me.

4105
04:20:57,870 --> 04:20:58,270
Nothing.

4106
04:20:58,270 --> 04:20:59,549
We had, we both had unleashed.

4107
04:21:09,079 --> 04:21:10,440
What a video game, Choi.

4108
04:21:12,459 --> 04:21:13,100
Come on, man.

4109
04:21:13,100 --> 04:21:14,620
We got to do this all day.

4110
04:21:17,819 --> 04:21:18,459
Okay.

4111
04:21:18,459 --> 04:21:19,180
Kick off.

4112
04:21:19,180 --> 04:21:19,739
Tie game.

4113
04:21:24,489 --> 04:21:26,360
It's okay.

4114
04:21:26,360 --> 04:21:26,840
It's fine.

4115
04:21:32,569 --> 04:21:33,049
Not good.

4116
04:21:33,049 --> 04:21:33,530
Not good.

4117
04:21:33,530 --> 04:21:34,569
I still got a guy in the back.

4118
04:21:34,569 --> 04:21:34,889
No.

4119
04:21:41,500 --> 04:21:45,239
Cardiff.

4120
04:21:45,239 --> 04:21:48,280
Why?

4121
04:21:48,280 --> 04:21:49,559
This is so unfair.

4122
04:21:59,229 --> 04:22:00,829
At what point am I going to have not enough people

4123
04:22:00,829 --> 04:22:01,549
to play the game?

4124
04:22:08,510 --> 04:22:10,430
It really might be that they're on too many drugs.

4125
04:22:13,280 --> 04:22:16,159
By the way, the guy in the back fell down on his own.

4126
04:22:26,750 --> 04:22:27,950
Dude just tripped in the snow.

4127
04:22:28,840 --> 04:22:30,120
This really is the Pee Wee League.

4128
04:22:33,739 --> 04:22:35,260
I got all my sponsor gear on too.

4129
04:22:35,260 --> 04:22:36,139
It's like bullshit.

4130
04:22:38,239 --> 04:22:39,719
I'm going to let you get that one.

4131
04:22:41,770 --> 04:22:44,010
I am closer to a special than he is.

4132
04:22:45,129 --> 04:22:45,370
All right.

4133
04:22:45,370 --> 04:22:46,010
Come on back in.

4134
04:22:47,610 --> 04:22:48,090
Good.

4135
04:22:48,090 --> 04:22:48,889
You good to go?

4136
04:22:48,889 --> 04:22:50,329
The rollback.

4137
04:22:50,329 --> 04:22:50,969
Whatever that is.

4138
04:22:54,270 --> 04:22:54,750
Throw it down.

4139
04:22:55,629 --> 04:22:59,520
There's no way you can catch that ball.

4140
04:23:03,610 --> 04:23:04,649
There within 30.

4141
04:23:04,649 --> 04:23:06,170
It's time to put up or shut up.

4142
04:23:06,170 --> 04:23:07,290
I got to get a dirty hit on him.

4143
04:23:08,329 --> 04:23:08,889
Here it comes.

4144
04:23:08,889 --> 04:23:09,290
Dirty hit.

4145
04:23:19,200 --> 04:23:20,319
I wish I could run like that.

4146
04:23:20,319 --> 04:23:22,159
I mean, if that were me.

4147
04:23:25,549 --> 04:23:26,510
It fell down in the snow.

4148
04:23:30,750 --> 04:23:38,600
I got a bunch of like random dudes

4149
04:23:38,600 --> 04:23:40,920
from like the AA leagues in my lineup right now.

4150
04:23:40,920 --> 04:23:41,399
It's not me.

4151
04:23:42,280 --> 04:23:51,340
Not a bad return.

4152
04:23:51,340 --> 04:24:04,620
Let's do crosses.

4153
04:24:04,620 --> 04:24:04,940
All right.

4154
04:24:04,940 --> 04:24:05,340
Finally.

4155
04:24:07,340 --> 04:24:07,979
Robbie's back in.

4156
04:24:09,899 --> 04:24:11,819
The offense looking at first and 30.

4157
04:24:18,520 --> 04:24:19,000
There it is.

4158
04:24:20,840 --> 04:24:23,239
That's what they call a textbook execution.

4159
04:24:33,290 --> 04:24:35,690
Still haven't seen x-ray ball crush.

4160
04:24:36,889 --> 04:24:37,770
Resident sleeper.

4161
04:24:43,180 --> 04:24:43,579
He'll go.

4162
04:24:44,600 --> 04:24:45,239
Just tie it up.

4163
04:24:53,309 --> 04:25:03,870
I haven't unleashed.

4164
04:25:03,870 --> 04:25:04,829
Let's see if I can get the ball back.

4165
04:25:05,790 --> 04:25:09,440
Give me that ball back.

4166
04:25:10,399 --> 04:25:10,639
Bump.

4167
04:25:13,840 --> 04:25:16,000
And so at the end of one quarter of play.

4168
04:25:16,000 --> 04:25:16,639
We're tied.

4169
04:25:20,350 --> 04:25:22,909
You thought I was making the beer chugging sound effect?

4170
04:25:26,510 --> 04:25:28,030
That'd be pretty cool if I was.

4171
04:25:28,750 --> 04:25:31,950
Where are we going?

4172
04:25:31,950 --> 04:25:33,579
It's that damn quarterback.

4173
04:25:35,120 --> 04:25:45,530
Can't see them go to shit their pants.

4174
04:25:46,329 --> 04:25:49,159
Yeah, we do.

4175
04:25:49,159 --> 04:25:50,280
He's got a lot of viewers coming.

4176
04:25:50,280 --> 04:25:50,840
Is there a raid?

4177
04:25:51,719 --> 04:25:57,639
Did a raid just come in?

4178
04:25:58,920 --> 04:25:59,799
There's the dirty hit, right?

4179
04:26:08,909 --> 04:26:11,309
The quarterback is the paint and the paint.

4180
04:26:11,309 --> 04:26:13,149
Whoever is hosting or rating or whatever.

4181
04:26:13,149 --> 04:26:13,790
Thank you so much.

4182
04:26:18,040 --> 04:26:20,590
That's a shitload of people.

4183
04:26:21,229 --> 04:26:22,840
Oh, this is blitz the league.

4184
04:26:25,549 --> 04:26:26,110
Nice.

4185
04:26:26,110 --> 04:26:27,629
That's exactly what I needed to have happen.

4186
04:26:28,430 --> 04:26:35,549
They're going to punt it.

4187
04:26:35,549 --> 04:26:36,110
Oh, shit.

4188
04:26:36,110 --> 04:26:36,670
They're putting it.

4189
04:26:42,299 --> 04:26:43,180
They had a long way to go.

4190
04:26:43,180 --> 04:26:43,579
That's right.

4191
04:26:47,069 --> 04:26:47,709
Good run here.

4192
04:26:47,709 --> 04:26:48,030
Come on.

4193
04:26:52,200 --> 04:27:07,129
We're good.

4194
04:27:07,129 --> 04:27:07,690
Everything's fine.

4195
04:27:13,100 --> 04:27:14,459
First down and 30.

4196
04:27:16,829 --> 04:27:18,219
Get a good play here.

4197
04:27:19,100 --> 04:27:21,959
That was a good play.

4198
04:27:22,760 --> 04:27:27,959
I still got plenty of time in the quarter.

4199
04:27:27,959 --> 04:27:28,840
Trick play.

4200
04:27:28,840 --> 04:27:29,799
Razzle dazzle.

4201
04:27:29,799 --> 04:27:30,520
Razzle go.

4202
04:27:30,520 --> 04:27:32,040
One minute left in the half.

4203
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:32,920
We're all tied up.

4204
04:27:36,430 --> 04:27:36,989
Wide open.

4205
04:27:36,989 --> 04:27:37,389
Beautiful.

4206
04:27:37,389 --> 04:27:38,430
Don't even need to use an unleash.

4207
04:27:38,430 --> 04:27:39,629
Defense lost track of it.

4208
04:27:39,629 --> 04:27:41,180
End zone.

4209
04:27:41,180 --> 04:27:48,250
Nice catch towards turning into a touchdown.

4210
04:27:54,840 --> 04:27:55,879
Nicely done.

4211
04:27:55,879 --> 04:27:58,440
We got them just where we want them.

4212
04:27:58,440 --> 04:27:59,639
Let's keep twisting the tournament.

4213
04:27:59,639 --> 04:28:00,920
No, just go for field goal.

4214
04:28:00,920 --> 04:28:01,319
No reason.

4215
04:28:02,040 --> 04:28:10,920
The extra point is good.

4216
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:11,639
In a good position.

4217
04:28:14,600 --> 04:28:16,920
Can you do anything else besides the beer chug?

4218
04:28:17,959 --> 04:28:18,600
Yeah, you can.

4219
04:28:18,600 --> 04:28:19,559
I just don't know the code.

4220
04:28:21,280 --> 04:28:25,120
And the codes, it gives you a blip.

4221
04:28:25,120 --> 04:28:25,920
So that's why I'm doing it.

4222
04:28:25,920 --> 04:28:28,319
By the way, speaking of blips, injury incoming.

4223
04:28:32,559 --> 04:28:32,799
Yes.

4224
04:28:32,799 --> 04:28:34,479
Las Vegas makes the recovery.

4225
04:28:34,479 --> 04:28:34,959
Thank God.

4226
04:28:36,079 --> 04:28:37,200
It's going my way.

4227
04:28:37,200 --> 04:28:37,840
Championship game.

4228
04:28:37,840 --> 04:28:38,079
OK.

4229
04:28:38,079 --> 04:28:39,280
Oh, close call.

4230
04:28:40,079 --> 04:28:41,920
Tough guy didn't break a nail getting the ball back.

4231
04:28:43,309 --> 04:28:44,510
Let's go for a run.

4232
04:28:44,510 --> 04:28:46,110
Crucial series of downs here.

4233
04:28:48,559 --> 04:28:50,829
That's OK.

4234
04:28:51,709 --> 04:28:52,590
I still got plenty of time.

4235
04:28:52,590 --> 04:28:53,309
Run the clock out.

4236
04:28:54,270 --> 04:28:54,989
Oh, no.

4237
04:28:55,549 --> 04:28:57,229
Please tell me that wasn't his knee.

4238
04:29:02,159 --> 04:29:07,659
Looking for the big play.

4239
04:29:07,659 --> 04:29:09,659
And the defender says nothing doing.

4240
04:29:10,780 --> 04:29:12,219
PS4 or is this PS3?

4241
04:29:12,219 --> 04:29:13,659
OK, I'm thinking maybe we should.

4242
04:29:14,620 --> 04:29:17,159
Why the hell is the team's sideline?

4243
04:29:19,790 --> 04:29:23,899
The offense might want to mix it up here.

4244
04:29:23,899 --> 04:29:26,059
They've been a little predictable the first two downs.

4245
04:29:31,450 --> 04:29:32,729
All right, I can get a field goal.

4246
04:29:33,450 --> 04:29:34,959
Just don't screw it up.

4247
04:29:34,959 --> 04:29:35,440
Field goal.

4248
04:29:37,899 --> 04:29:38,540
Field goal.

4249
04:29:38,540 --> 04:29:40,620
OK, so am I going to aim this in the right place?

4250
04:29:51,040 --> 04:29:52,319
Triangle square X circle.

4251
04:29:52,959 --> 04:30:07,600
All right, you got that was a good lay hit.

4252
04:30:09,629 --> 04:30:10,110
Incoming.

4253
04:30:10,110 --> 04:30:10,989
Wrong guy, but it's fine.

4254
04:30:15,149 --> 04:30:16,590
We've been a little frame droppy today.

4255
04:30:17,149 --> 04:30:18,270
I apologize about that.

4256
04:30:21,760 --> 04:30:23,440
First down, 30 yards to go.

4257
04:30:23,440 --> 04:30:25,920
Just don't let them get a touchdown.

4258
04:30:25,920 --> 04:30:27,120
There's 11 seconds left.

4259
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:33,020
That didn't count as a dirty hit.

4260
04:30:33,020 --> 04:30:36,670
Milwaukee really executed on that big step down the field.

4261
04:30:36,670 --> 04:30:37,229
Nice work.

4262
04:30:43,799 --> 04:30:45,159
That didn't count as a late hit.

4263
04:30:50,840 --> 04:30:51,879
Sorry, just ended.

4264
04:30:53,950 --> 04:30:57,309
And so at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 10.

4265
04:31:01,950 --> 04:31:02,590
I get the ball.

4266
04:31:05,290 --> 04:31:07,129
What the fuck is this clown shit?

4267
04:31:07,129 --> 04:31:08,250
This is blitz the lead.

4268
04:31:09,530 --> 04:31:10,809
I'm running it out of bounds.

4269
04:31:10,809 --> 04:31:11,209
No, I'm not.

4270
04:31:11,209 --> 04:31:12,250
I'm running it into the end zone.

4271
04:31:13,530 --> 04:31:16,399
Oh, come on.

4272
04:31:16,399 --> 04:31:17,360
That would have been perfect.

4273
04:31:19,100 --> 04:31:19,420
All right.

4274
04:31:19,420 --> 04:31:23,260
I got to I got to play the the boundaries here.

4275
04:31:24,139 --> 04:31:30,399
Because first and 30 very we're in snow weather vulnerable.

4276
04:31:31,040 --> 04:31:36,540
He cannot fumble the ball to play the outside.

4277
04:31:37,340 --> 04:31:45,879
Fine.

4278
04:31:45,879 --> 04:31:46,600
I'm okay with that.

4279
04:31:47,319 --> 04:31:59,440
Get in there.

4280
04:32:00,159 --> 04:32:05,760
This same guy a second injury.

4281
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:06,799
Robbie is out again.

4282
04:32:13,389 --> 04:32:14,430
That was not good, but it's okay.

4283
04:32:19,959 --> 04:32:21,559
This guy is made out of jelly.

4284
04:32:21,559 --> 04:32:23,959
There's no way he's made out of like rubber bands or something.

4285
04:32:25,639 --> 04:32:26,440
Fourth and one.

4286
04:32:33,979 --> 04:32:34,780
I'm not confident.

4287
04:32:35,639 --> 04:32:35,879
Go.

4288
04:32:36,520 --> 04:32:37,479
Just right through the middle.

4289
04:32:42,750 --> 04:32:42,989
Nice.

4290
04:32:46,510 --> 04:32:49,549
Let's go lightning.

4291
04:32:49,549 --> 04:32:50,909
First down and 30.

4292
04:32:54,959 --> 04:33:01,719
Caught it.

4293
04:33:01,719 --> 04:33:02,840
Jelly rubber bands.

4294
04:33:02,840 --> 04:33:04,680
You see the blonde on the sideline?

4295
04:33:04,680 --> 04:33:05,159
See her?

4296
04:33:05,159 --> 04:33:05,720
Huh?

4297
04:33:05,720 --> 04:33:07,240
That's a nice piece of ass.

4298
04:33:07,240 --> 04:33:07,639
All right.

4299
04:33:11,180 --> 04:33:11,659
Right side.

4300
04:33:12,299 --> 04:33:16,009
Too fat to push him over.

4301
04:33:21,919 --> 04:33:22,240
All right.

4302
04:33:22,240 --> 04:33:22,720
Robbie's back.

4303
04:33:26,080 --> 04:33:27,680
Circle circle square.

4304
04:33:28,560 --> 04:33:29,279
X triangle.

4305
04:33:31,040 --> 04:33:34,080
Did I actually just do that?

4306
04:33:36,080 --> 04:33:36,319
Fuck.

4307
04:33:39,500 --> 04:33:39,979
Go for it.

4308
04:33:39,979 --> 04:33:40,459
I don't care.

4309
04:33:42,700 --> 04:33:43,740
What the fuck is happening?

4310
04:33:51,549 --> 04:33:51,950
Get up.

4311
04:33:52,990 --> 04:33:53,389
Touchdown.

4312
04:33:59,549 --> 04:33:59,950
Snow.

4313
04:34:00,750 --> 04:34:01,549
Stupid snow.

4314
04:34:18,700 --> 04:34:19,900
Trying to get squished.

4315
04:34:19,900 --> 04:34:21,020
I didn't have an opportunity to do it.

4316
04:34:21,900 --> 04:34:30,970
We're printed out of reach in the championship game.

4317
04:34:30,970 --> 04:34:39,020
We might see an entire...

4318
04:34:39,020 --> 04:34:40,459
That guy wasn't even hard to play.

4319
04:34:42,360 --> 04:34:43,240
Uh, it's...

4320
04:34:43,240 --> 04:34:43,639
I don't know.

4321
04:34:43,639 --> 04:34:44,279
We're gonna have to...

4322
04:34:45,000 --> 04:34:46,919
I'm not sure you're gonna be able to see the testicles.

4323
04:34:47,720 --> 04:34:49,419
Sorry, guys.

4324
04:34:50,139 --> 04:34:50,919
I'm trying.

4325
04:34:55,130 --> 04:35:00,939
Damn.

4326
04:35:01,900 --> 04:35:03,439
I'm trying.

4327
04:35:03,439 --> 04:35:05,150
That guy got hit for it.

4328
04:35:05,150 --> 04:35:05,790
Sometimes they...

4329
04:35:05,790 --> 04:35:08,029
You knock the quarterback in the next Tuesday.

4330
04:35:08,029 --> 04:35:13,819
Was that before or after when this game came out?

4331
04:35:13,819 --> 04:35:14,299
I don't know.

4332
04:35:15,340 --> 04:35:19,180
Goes way downfield.

4333
04:35:19,180 --> 04:35:21,259
And it's complete after 35.

4334
04:35:22,139 --> 04:35:24,919
Sorry.

4335
04:35:24,919 --> 04:35:25,720
We're still waiting.

4336
04:35:25,720 --> 04:35:27,799
Wrestling run after the catch for the score.

4337
04:35:28,919 --> 04:35:30,759
That's what I was trying to get a hit on the quarterback.

4338
04:35:31,479 --> 04:35:32,279
I would have had that guy.

4339
04:35:32,279 --> 04:35:32,919
I'm the safety.

4340
04:35:32,919 --> 04:35:34,040
I shouldn't be doing that play.

4341
04:35:34,840 --> 04:35:36,119
But I was doing it anyways, I guess.

4342
04:35:36,119 --> 04:35:36,439
Whatever.

4343
04:35:37,080 --> 04:35:37,560
I got it!

4344
04:35:38,599 --> 04:35:40,200
I actually fucking blocked the field goal.

4345
04:35:42,200 --> 04:35:42,520
Yes!

4346
04:35:44,200 --> 04:35:45,159
Oh, I've...

4347
04:35:45,159 --> 04:35:45,479
My...

4348
04:35:45,479 --> 04:35:46,840
Okay, that's a weight off my shoulders.

4349
04:35:47,959 --> 04:35:54,959
By the way, I understand that that reaction was as if somebody was dropping a couch.

4350
04:35:55,520 --> 04:35:56,479
And I was on the other side.

4351
04:35:58,650 --> 04:35:58,889
I got...

4352
04:35:58,889 --> 04:35:59,290
I got it!

4353
04:35:59,290 --> 04:35:59,610
I got it!

4354
04:36:00,169 --> 04:36:03,150
First down.

4355
04:36:03,150 --> 04:36:04,029
30 yards to go.

4356
04:36:10,060 --> 04:36:10,619
Bad yardage.

4357
04:36:13,130 --> 04:36:14,409
Onside kick.

4358
04:36:15,290 --> 04:36:18,200
See, now they're just getting desperate.

4359
04:36:18,200 --> 04:36:19,000
Because I got the ball.

4360
04:36:19,000 --> 04:36:19,720
I got plenty of time.

4361
04:36:36,360 --> 04:36:37,400
All right, now I'm just being an asshole.

4362
04:36:41,720 --> 04:36:41,959
What?

4363
04:36:45,479 --> 04:36:46,119
Robbie, no!

4364
04:36:52,299 --> 04:36:53,180
He tried so hard.

4365
04:36:53,819 --> 04:36:54,540
He tried.

4366
04:36:54,540 --> 04:36:56,540
He was such an integral part of the team.

4367
04:36:57,659 --> 04:36:58,139
He's dead.

4368
04:37:00,110 --> 04:37:00,990
We gotta win this one.

4369
04:37:05,529 --> 04:37:07,450
Can I make this field goal?

4370
04:37:07,450 --> 04:37:08,009
Robbie's dead.

4371
04:37:08,729 --> 04:37:10,779
It's all right.

4372
04:37:10,779 --> 04:37:12,939
His memory will live on when we beat...

4373
04:37:12,939 --> 04:37:14,220
When we win the championship game.

4374
04:37:17,080 --> 04:37:19,159
To get out of Peewee leagues.

4375
04:37:19,159 --> 04:37:20,200
And to go into like...

4376
04:37:22,490 --> 04:37:23,689
Baby division.

4377
04:37:23,689 --> 04:37:27,520
Oops.

4378
04:37:35,720 --> 04:37:39,400
Do it for Robbie.

4379
04:37:40,040 --> 04:37:41,000
I'm gonna do it for Robbie.

4380
04:37:43,950 --> 04:37:45,069
From Peewee...

4381
04:37:45,069 --> 04:37:46,509
From Peewee to Weewee.

4382
04:37:47,790 --> 04:37:48,029
Yep.

4383
04:37:52,080 --> 04:37:53,279
He's a good player, too.

4384
04:37:53,840 --> 04:37:58,270
This is it!

4385
04:37:59,770 --> 04:38:00,409
Oh, no!

4386
04:38:00,409 --> 04:38:00,889
That's the...

4387
04:38:00,889 --> 04:38:01,770
That's the quarterback.

4388
04:38:07,419 --> 04:38:08,299
Out for the season.

4389
04:38:11,159 --> 04:38:18,680
Got it.

4390
04:38:18,680 --> 04:38:21,479
Nah, this game is unwinnable for them.

4391
04:38:21,479 --> 04:38:23,080
They have a backup quarterback in right now.

4392
04:38:23,080 --> 04:38:23,959
Why don't we kill him too?

4393
04:38:27,080 --> 04:38:32,169
We gotta get revenge for...

4394
04:38:33,369 --> 04:38:34,650
Robbie, what are you talking about?

4395
04:38:34,650 --> 04:38:35,290
Don't do that.

4396
04:38:35,290 --> 04:38:36,250
You don't want revenge.

4397
04:38:36,810 --> 04:38:39,849
For the broken, shattered neck that they gave to Robbie.

4398
04:38:43,369 --> 04:38:44,490
What the hell was that?

4399
04:38:44,490 --> 04:38:45,450
What the hell was that?

4400
04:38:46,409 --> 04:38:51,450
Flocky tears up a good chunk of field there.

4401
04:38:51,450 --> 04:38:52,970
And you can see him getting revved up.

4402
04:38:54,720 --> 04:38:55,520
First and goal.

4403
04:38:55,520 --> 04:38:56,560
It's gut check time.

4404
04:39:01,340 --> 04:39:06,779
What the fuck was that?

4405
04:39:07,580 --> 04:39:10,650
What the...

4406
04:39:10,650 --> 04:39:13,209
He could have fixed the receiver's eyesight at that time.

4407
04:39:13,209 --> 04:39:15,290
He could have garnered his name with a receiver's helmet.

4408
04:39:15,290 --> 04:39:17,290
He could have leveled the receiver's bookshelf.

4409
04:39:17,290 --> 04:39:19,450
Lasers are amazing things!

4410
04:39:19,450 --> 04:39:20,250
Okay.

4411
04:39:20,250 --> 04:39:21,610
Well, now this just became a game.

4412
04:39:22,650 --> 04:39:25,689
So, I have to run the clock out.

4413
04:39:29,500 --> 04:39:33,419
And the extra point is good.

4414
04:39:34,299 --> 04:39:36,220
They need a touchdown and a two-pointer version.

4415
04:39:37,020 --> 04:39:39,340
And as long as I can get a field goal.

4416
04:39:39,340 --> 04:39:41,419
It looks like they'll try an on-side kick here.

4417
04:39:42,380 --> 04:39:46,729
Uh-oh, Cox.

4418
04:39:48,319 --> 04:39:50,880
I don't have my all-star half-back though.

4419
04:39:51,599 --> 04:40:02,240
Pick it up.

4420
04:40:02,240 --> 04:40:04,220
Las Vegas gets it back.

4421
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:07,000
Oh, the defense can taste that.

4422
04:40:07,000 --> 04:40:08,840
Game over if I can get an end-zoner.

4423
04:40:12,810 --> 04:40:16,009
I should get it because I have the unleashed championship.

4424
04:40:16,009 --> 04:40:16,889
Comes to Las Vegas.

4425
04:40:26,110 --> 04:40:27,069
Beer chug again!

4426
04:40:33,099 --> 04:40:34,299
27-40.

4427
04:40:34,299 --> 04:40:35,259
Fourth quarter game over.

4428
04:40:35,259 --> 04:40:35,580
I win.

4429
04:40:38,970 --> 04:40:41,229
Want to see something funny?

4430
04:40:43,319 --> 04:40:48,880
Oh, this doesn't run the clock out.

4431
04:40:50,270 --> 04:40:50,509
Oh.

4432
04:40:52,000 --> 04:40:52,240
Right.

4433
04:40:52,240 --> 04:40:52,720
Never mind.

4434
04:40:55,840 --> 04:40:56,799
I'm getting booed.

4435
04:41:02,599 --> 04:41:04,119
Yeah, on their home turf.

4436
04:41:08,490 --> 04:41:08,889
Good job.

4437
04:41:08,889 --> 04:41:11,770
I forgot that I thought the clock was going to run out.

4438
04:41:11,770 --> 04:41:26,000
That should have been a safety.

4439
04:41:29,450 --> 04:41:30,409
I'm not looking for wagers.

4440
04:41:30,409 --> 04:41:31,290
I'm looking for...

4441
04:41:31,290 --> 04:41:32,490
Wait, how many points do I have to win by?

4442
04:41:47,229 --> 04:41:48,750
That was such a bomb pass.

4443
04:41:49,950 --> 04:41:55,680
That's your last play.

4444
04:41:55,680 --> 04:41:56,400
Don't matter.

4445
04:41:56,400 --> 04:41:57,680
Might as well just give you a touchdown.

4446
04:41:58,560 --> 04:41:58,880
Fun.

4447
04:41:59,680 --> 04:42:05,479
And I got one second.

4448
04:42:05,479 --> 04:42:05,959
Quick, quick, quick.

4449
04:42:05,959 --> 04:42:06,599
I want to hurt somebody.

4450
04:42:07,240 --> 04:42:08,119
Let's game over.

4451
04:42:08,119 --> 04:42:09,560
Championship wins.

4452
04:42:09,560 --> 04:42:14,119
So Las Vegas wins the Division III championship and will move up to Division II.

4453
04:42:14,119 --> 04:42:14,520
That's it.

4454
04:42:15,240 --> 04:42:15,880
I win the game.

4455
04:42:20,669 --> 04:42:21,310
Robbie's dead.

4456
04:42:25,020 --> 04:42:26,669
Out forever.

4457
04:42:33,959 --> 04:42:35,560
I didn't get the $20,000 wager.

4458
04:42:40,599 --> 04:42:42,200
Silver trophy for a rookie.

4459
04:42:43,159 --> 04:42:43,950
Very nice.

4460
04:42:44,669 --> 04:42:49,080
I miss Robbie.

4461
04:42:49,639 --> 04:42:57,439
Both your A&B samples came back positive, son.

4462
04:42:57,439 --> 04:42:58,479
This is bullshit.

4463
04:42:58,479 --> 04:43:00,639
He's never used steroids in his life.

4464
04:43:00,639 --> 04:43:03,919
You're trying to bend him over because he wouldn't play for your precious LA Riot.

4465
04:43:05,290 --> 04:43:08,970
You know, franchise, I can make this go away.

4466
04:43:10,169 --> 04:43:14,490
If you play for the Riot and sign a six-year contract.

4467
04:43:14,490 --> 04:43:15,130
Oh, I got...

4468
04:43:16,330 --> 04:43:16,729
I got...

4469
04:43:16,729 --> 04:43:17,849
Fuck you.

4470
04:43:17,849 --> 04:43:18,490
No deal.

4471
04:43:19,130 --> 04:43:20,330
They're conspiring against me.

4472
04:43:20,330 --> 04:43:21,049
This is what's going on.

4473
04:43:21,130 --> 04:43:23,529
Last, if the sponsors hear you flunked a drug test.

4474
04:43:23,529 --> 04:43:26,009
Man, I ain't flunked no fucking drug test.

4475
04:43:27,709 --> 04:43:29,869
Except you probably did because we've been taking drugs the whole season.

4476
04:43:34,349 --> 04:43:35,389
Oh, shit.

4477
04:43:35,389 --> 04:43:38,509
Ultranull is on the FBI's banned substance list.

4478
04:43:38,509 --> 04:43:42,110
In fact, you've probably taken a drug every other game, franchise.

4479
04:43:42,110 --> 04:43:43,310
Sir, you're under arrest.

4480
04:43:43,310 --> 04:43:43,709
What the hell?

4481
04:43:43,709 --> 04:43:44,909
No time to explain.

4482
04:43:44,909 --> 04:43:46,029
Gotta get you a lawyer.

4483
04:43:46,029 --> 04:43:46,830
You give up that right.

4484
04:43:46,830 --> 04:43:50,029
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

4485
04:43:50,990 --> 04:43:59,520
Quick, dive out the window.

4486
04:44:10,270 --> 04:44:11,450
Is this the prison?

4487
04:44:11,450 --> 04:44:16,250
From the Newtown State Correctional Facility, Mr. Franchise.

4488
04:44:17,290 --> 04:44:21,369
Ordinarily, I don't like having celebrities in my prison.

4489
04:44:21,369 --> 04:44:24,889
However, you're a happy exception.

4490
04:44:24,889 --> 04:44:27,520
Man, what's this?

4491
04:44:27,520 --> 04:44:31,439
Well, it just so happens that next month we're having our annual football game

4492
04:44:31,439 --> 04:44:33,680
against the Supermax facility down the road.

4493
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:36,560
And you just became my ringer, son.

4494
04:44:37,439 --> 04:44:38,639
That ain't no movie.

4495
04:44:38,639 --> 04:44:40,880
I ain't playing in some prison game.

4496
04:44:40,880 --> 04:44:43,119
You can play and be out of here in time for training camp.

4497
04:44:43,119 --> 04:44:44,400
Or you can refuse.

4498
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:47,279
And piss away the next two years making license plates.

4499
04:44:47,279 --> 04:44:47,840
Or have to win.

4500
04:44:48,479 --> 04:44:49,200
So what do you say?

4501
04:44:50,569 --> 04:44:51,450
Super Bowl II.

4502
04:44:52,169 --> 04:44:53,130
Get out of jail.

4503
04:44:53,130 --> 04:44:53,770
Sounds good to me.

4504
04:44:54,889 --> 04:44:56,590
What time is practice?

4505
04:44:59,849 --> 04:45:03,770
Milltown Correctional versus the Supermax prison team.

4506
04:45:06,889 --> 04:45:09,869
There's a reason we've never beaten the Supermax prison team.

4507
04:45:10,830 --> 04:45:11,720
Oh, God.

4508
04:45:12,759 --> 04:45:16,639
It's guys like Carl Turpitz that have made that hell hole their home.

4509
04:45:17,439 --> 04:45:23,599
Turpitz is serving time for 23 counts of aggravated assault.

4510
04:45:24,720 --> 04:45:25,759
No helmets either.

4511
04:45:26,880 --> 04:45:40,720
Too bad we can't beat Shackle.

4512
04:45:43,119 --> 04:45:43,840
This is wild.

4513
04:45:44,880 --> 04:45:45,279
All right.

4514
04:45:45,840 --> 04:45:48,400
So, yeah, I think I know how to play the game.

4515
04:45:55,689 --> 04:45:56,669
What are the rules?

4516
04:45:58,349 --> 04:45:59,229
Is it just a game?

4517
04:45:59,950 --> 04:46:01,470
Is anybody watching?

4518
04:46:02,189 --> 04:46:09,979
No, this is it.

4519
04:46:09,979 --> 04:46:10,700
We're just out here.

4520
04:46:11,580 --> 04:46:13,930
Who are my teammates?

4521
04:46:17,040 --> 04:46:17,759
Oh, God.

4522
04:46:17,759 --> 04:46:18,720
This is ridiculous.

4523
04:46:18,720 --> 04:46:19,040
Okay.

4524
04:46:19,040 --> 04:46:20,560
So there's no kickoff.

4525
04:46:21,279 --> 04:46:23,209
There he is.

4526
04:46:23,209 --> 04:46:23,450
All right.

4527
04:46:23,450 --> 04:46:24,889
Watch out for the guy on the left.

4528
04:46:24,889 --> 04:46:26,250
First and 45.

4529
04:46:29,240 --> 04:46:29,560
Got it.

4530
04:46:29,560 --> 04:46:30,439
Touchdown right there.

4531
04:46:31,240 --> 04:46:31,959
First play of the game.

4532
04:46:32,759 --> 04:46:33,159
Get it.

4533
04:46:34,139 --> 04:46:34,459
Got it.

4534
04:46:37,799 --> 04:46:39,319
It's 45 yards from first down.

4535
04:46:49,279 --> 04:46:49,680
Muscle?

4536
04:46:50,400 --> 04:46:51,759
I got a new playbook.

4537
04:46:53,799 --> 04:46:54,200
Okay.

4538
04:46:54,200 --> 04:46:54,599
Wait a minute.

4539
04:46:54,599 --> 04:46:54,919
Hold on.

4540
04:46:54,919 --> 04:46:55,319
There's no...

4541
04:46:56,959 --> 04:46:57,759
There's no field goal.

4542
04:47:00,639 --> 04:47:04,360
You have to do a two-point conversion?

4543
04:47:05,080 --> 04:47:12,330
And now, okay, there's no kickoff.

4544
04:47:12,330 --> 04:47:13,689
There's no special teams.

4545
04:47:14,330 --> 04:47:15,209
This is ridiculous.

4546
04:47:16,409 --> 04:47:18,880
All right.

4547
04:47:18,880 --> 04:47:19,279
Not bad.

4548
04:47:19,840 --> 04:47:24,439
Well, let's go with...

4549
04:47:24,439 --> 04:47:25,240
Let's stay with cover.

4550
04:47:26,279 --> 04:47:27,639
That guy's not on the field right now.

4551
04:47:32,919 --> 04:47:33,720
Take the shoulder off.

4552
04:47:38,400 --> 04:47:40,080
That's always the most devastating one.

4553
04:47:40,080 --> 04:47:46,029
That guy gonna get up?

4554
04:47:47,580 --> 04:47:48,779
Nobody comes and even picks him up.

4555
04:47:58,459 --> 04:47:58,939
Is this it?

4556
04:48:14,720 --> 04:48:15,040
What?

4557
04:48:16,729 --> 04:48:18,970
Forgot how fucking awful that was.

4558
04:48:19,950 --> 04:48:20,189
Ooh.

4559
04:48:22,319 --> 04:48:23,119
All right.

4560
04:48:23,119 --> 04:48:23,520
We're good.

4561
04:48:24,720 --> 04:48:31,770
That's a turnover.

4562
04:48:32,330 --> 04:48:34,189
Let's go.

4563
04:48:34,750 --> 04:48:35,630
Let's go with the slant play.

4564
04:48:42,639 --> 04:48:43,040
Got it.

4565
04:48:43,840 --> 04:48:44,240
I'm still...

4566
04:48:44,240 --> 04:48:44,400
No.

4567
04:48:44,400 --> 04:48:44,959
Nobody touch me.

4568
04:48:44,959 --> 04:48:45,520
Nobody touch me.

4569
04:48:47,099 --> 04:48:47,740
Oh, what's it?

4570
04:48:47,740 --> 04:48:49,099
Oh, beer chug.

4571
04:49:04,319 --> 04:49:04,639
All right.

4572
04:49:04,639 --> 04:49:04,959
I got...

4573
04:49:05,919 --> 04:49:06,159
It's...

4574
04:49:06,959 --> 04:49:07,950
It's all right.

4575
04:49:12,759 --> 04:49:13,159
Nice.

4576
04:49:13,159 --> 04:49:13,560
It's all right.

4577
04:49:15,319 --> 04:49:15,880
14-0.

4578
04:49:16,439 --> 04:49:17,709
Come on, man.

4579
04:49:17,709 --> 04:49:19,869
We gotta do this all day.

4580
04:49:19,869 --> 04:49:20,830
Let's get up, man.

4581
04:49:20,830 --> 04:49:21,470
Come on.

4582
04:49:21,470 --> 04:49:22,669
That's not the same voice actor.

4583
04:49:22,669 --> 04:49:23,950
That's a completely different voice.

4584
04:49:26,270 --> 04:49:26,750
Come on, man.

4585
04:49:26,750 --> 04:49:28,430
We gotta do this all day.

4586
04:49:30,430 --> 04:49:33,680
Is he going with it?

4587
04:49:38,080 --> 04:49:38,319
Nice.

4588
04:49:38,319 --> 04:49:39,360
That's a fumble recovery.

4589
04:49:40,520 --> 04:49:40,840
That's a...

4590
04:49:40,840 --> 04:49:53,080
56.

4591
04:49:53,080 --> 04:49:54,250
56.

4592
04:49:54,250 --> 04:49:58,139
Play hit.

4593
04:49:58,139 --> 04:49:58,700
No helmets.

4594
04:50:10,189 --> 04:50:11,069
Let's go with zone blitz.

4595
04:50:13,290 --> 04:50:13,610
Cox.

4596
04:50:13,610 --> 04:50:14,330
Oh, Cox.

4597
04:50:15,209 --> 04:50:16,250
Cox is being stupid.

4598
04:50:19,069 --> 04:50:21,360
Fuck.

4599
04:50:21,360 --> 04:50:22,319
I was trying to knock him down.

4600
04:50:23,119 --> 04:50:24,959
I was trying to just jump into him.

4601
04:50:25,599 --> 04:50:27,599
Now, everybody does like the shit emote.

4602
04:50:34,880 --> 04:50:43,630
Oh.

4603
04:50:56,080 --> 04:50:56,400
Shit.

4604
04:50:58,509 --> 04:50:59,869
That's a safety.

4605
04:50:59,869 --> 04:51:00,669
Where are we?

4606
04:51:01,630 --> 04:51:02,669
What the...

4607
04:51:02,669 --> 04:51:03,709
Where was that?

4608
04:51:03,709 --> 04:51:04,909
Oh, my God.

4609
04:51:04,909 --> 04:51:05,630
That was bad.

4610
04:51:10,669 --> 04:51:11,549
This is bad.

4611
04:51:19,930 --> 04:51:24,750
Oh, the game's...

4612
04:51:24,750 --> 04:51:25,470
The game broke.

4613
04:51:26,430 --> 04:51:27,150
This is...

4614
04:51:27,150 --> 04:51:28,189
This is all glitched out.

4615
04:51:29,150 --> 04:51:33,209
Dude, I just intercepted the fucking football.

4616
04:51:33,209 --> 04:51:44,380
I can't get out of here.

4617
04:51:47,709 --> 04:51:48,029
Wow.

4618
04:51:50,189 --> 04:51:50,430
Okay.

4619
04:51:50,430 --> 04:51:53,790
Can we maybe relax here a second and...

4620
04:52:01,119 --> 04:52:03,200
Something is fucked up with this controller, I think.

4621
04:52:04,159 --> 04:52:04,959
Something's going on.

4622
04:52:04,959 --> 04:52:05,279
Weird.

4623
04:52:07,049 --> 04:52:07,529
I lost...

4624
04:52:08,330 --> 04:52:09,930
I don't see any player icons.

4625
04:52:09,930 --> 04:52:10,729
Shit.

4626
04:52:10,729 --> 04:52:11,209
See what I'm saying?

4627
04:52:11,209 --> 04:52:11,930
What the hell's going on?

4628
04:52:12,889 --> 04:52:13,130
Who's...

4629
04:52:14,009 --> 04:52:19,040
You guys know what I'm talking about.

4630
04:52:19,040 --> 04:52:19,759
Like, this is weird.

4631
04:52:20,639 --> 04:52:22,959
Did I win?

4632
04:52:23,680 --> 04:52:31,150
Yeah, something ain't right.

4633
04:52:36,540 --> 04:52:37,099
Ain't right.

4634
04:52:37,740 --> 04:52:41,599
I won.

4635
04:52:54,959 --> 04:53:15,450
I won the game, too.

4636
04:53:15,450 --> 04:53:16,250
That's unfortunate.

4637
04:53:17,049 --> 04:53:25,040
I'm gonna call that a win.

4638
04:53:25,759 --> 04:53:28,459
Did I save the game?

4639
04:53:28,459 --> 04:53:30,250
I'm pretty sure.

4640
04:53:30,889 --> 04:53:33,259
I'm pretty sure save is on by default, isn't it?

4641
04:53:34,220 --> 04:53:35,819
Your current game progress would be lost.

4642
04:53:39,000 --> 04:53:40,360
Yeah, I got soft-locked somehow.

4643
04:53:51,229 --> 04:53:52,270
I knew something weird was going on.

4644
04:53:52,270 --> 04:53:53,549
I lost the player icons.

4645
04:53:58,250 --> 04:53:58,490
Yeah.

4646
04:53:58,490 --> 04:53:58,810
All right.

4647
04:53:58,810 --> 04:54:01,180
Well, that's annoying.

4648
04:54:02,220 --> 04:54:05,130
See if it's still there.

4649
04:54:09,599 --> 04:54:12,159
Everything got really fucky after the ghost interception.

4650
04:54:14,200 --> 04:54:15,720
It soft-locked the whole game.

4651
04:54:23,180 --> 04:54:24,459
That was going so well, too.

4652
04:54:27,740 --> 04:54:28,380
Okay, here we go.

4653
04:54:29,500 --> 04:54:30,700
Should be back to normal, right?

4654
04:54:31,659 --> 04:54:31,979
Yes.

4655
04:54:31,979 --> 04:54:32,939
Now I see icons again.

4656
04:54:32,939 --> 04:54:33,740
That was very weird.

4657
04:54:34,459 --> 04:54:35,419
I'll just beat him again.

4658
04:54:36,380 --> 04:54:36,939
Just win.

4659
04:54:37,900 --> 04:54:45,130
Is it snowy outside or...

4660
04:54:45,130 --> 04:54:45,930
I don't understand.

4661
04:54:47,639 --> 04:54:48,200
We're gonna...

4662
04:54:48,200 --> 04:54:48,599
His hand...

4663
04:55:02,560 --> 04:55:04,560
There goes his wrist.

4664
04:55:04,560 --> 04:55:06,159
And his forearm.

4665
04:55:13,759 --> 04:55:15,119
Let's hope he was right-handed.

4666
04:55:17,040 --> 04:55:17,279
Yeah.

4667
04:55:18,159 --> 04:55:18,720
I agree.

4668
04:55:26,220 --> 04:55:29,310
Another exploded collar bone.

4669
04:55:29,310 --> 04:55:30,110
And we're gonna make it even.

4670
04:55:43,959 --> 04:55:45,000
Was that the arm?

4671
04:55:45,000 --> 04:55:46,279
Was that the arm that he did that with?

4672
04:55:46,279 --> 04:55:47,479
That was with the busted...

4673
04:55:47,479 --> 04:55:48,759
That was with the fucked up shoulder, too.

4674
04:55:49,319 --> 04:55:50,200
That's so funny.

4675
04:56:00,909 --> 04:56:02,029
All right, let's do some muscle here.

4676
04:56:04,439 --> 04:56:04,840
Belly.

4677
04:56:04,840 --> 04:56:06,279
We got some weird movement there.

4678
04:56:07,000 --> 04:56:10,919
And go wide open.

4679
04:56:13,919 --> 04:56:15,560
Touchdown.

4680
04:56:20,380 --> 04:56:21,419
I couldn't punch into code.

4681
04:56:25,150 --> 04:56:25,869
Go right up the middle.

4682
04:56:28,990 --> 04:56:34,830
There are no...

4683
04:56:35,709 --> 04:56:36,830
Yeah, there's no kicker.

4684
04:56:37,470 --> 04:56:38,189
There's no punts.

4685
04:56:38,189 --> 04:56:38,909
There's no kicking.

4686
04:56:41,180 --> 04:56:41,740
It's just...

4687
04:56:42,860 --> 04:56:43,259
Play.

4688
04:56:43,259 --> 04:56:44,139
No field goals.

4689
04:56:48,490 --> 04:56:49,369
That was beautiful.

4690
04:56:51,560 --> 04:56:52,840
He anticipated that dough

4691
04:56:52,840 --> 04:56:54,439
for the exact moment that he needed to.

4692
04:56:55,319 --> 04:56:58,599
And this should get another touchdown right here.

4693
04:56:58,599 --> 04:56:58,919
You know what?

4694
04:56:58,919 --> 04:56:59,240
Fuck it.

4695
04:56:59,240 --> 04:56:59,720
Watch this.

4696
04:57:03,689 --> 04:57:04,569
No, that's me.

4697
04:57:28,319 --> 04:57:29,840
My back hurts after that.

4698
04:57:29,840 --> 04:57:30,639
Oh, come on.

4699
04:57:38,569 --> 04:57:43,849
That was fucking ridiculous.

4700
04:57:46,490 --> 04:57:50,029
I was gonna go for a QB sneak

4701
04:57:50,830 --> 04:57:52,349
and get another free touchdown.

4702
04:58:17,319 --> 04:58:19,610
Up in the old end zone in the sky.

4703
04:58:19,610 --> 04:58:21,529
This is like doing it for me somehow.

4704
04:58:21,529 --> 04:58:28,729
I'm like fucking...

4705
04:58:28,729 --> 04:58:29,770
What the hell was that?

4706
04:58:31,959 --> 04:58:34,200
Oh, not safety.

4707
04:58:34,200 --> 04:58:34,919
No.

4708
04:58:35,720 --> 04:58:37,400
How big is this field?

4709
04:58:46,459 --> 04:58:48,220
This is the second time.

4710
04:58:48,220 --> 04:58:51,799
First time, I had a ghost interception

4711
04:58:51,799 --> 04:58:52,759
and it fucked up the game

4712
04:58:52,759 --> 04:58:54,759
and I was up by like 14 points.

4713
04:58:55,319 --> 04:58:57,959
Now, I was up by 14 points again

4714
04:58:57,959 --> 04:58:59,959
and they broke my neck and ruined my career.

4715
04:59:00,439 --> 04:59:02,439
And I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?

4716
04:59:02,439 --> 04:59:03,959
I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?

4717
04:59:03,959 --> 04:59:05,720
I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?

4718
04:59:06,680 --> 04:59:08,439
Okay, I need to get these off.

4719
04:59:10,840 --> 04:59:12,700
It's a 50-yard field.

4720
04:59:12,700 --> 04:59:13,900
You only get one possession.

4721
04:59:14,700 --> 04:59:30,189
I can't get over that.

4722
04:59:30,189 --> 04:59:30,689
Stupid.

4723
04:59:38,029 --> 04:59:38,990
How did they have 10?

4724
04:59:48,040 --> 04:59:48,540
Me.

4725
04:59:54,680 --> 04:59:55,400
I love this game.

4726
05:00:18,200 --> 05:00:21,000
So that's man crush knockout

4727
05:00:21,000 --> 05:00:22,599
is square, square, triangle, triangle.

4728
05:00:37,310 --> 05:00:37,790
All right.

4729
05:00:37,790 --> 05:00:39,470
Can somebody explain to me why

4730
05:00:41,200 --> 05:00:42,720
we just both did the same thing

4731
05:00:42,720 --> 05:00:44,159
and they have two extra points?

4732
05:00:49,720 --> 05:00:50,279
I don't get it.

4733
05:00:50,279 --> 05:00:50,779
What happened?

4734
05:00:51,479 --> 05:00:56,279
Oh, the safety.

4735
05:00:56,279 --> 05:00:58,119
Right, the safety in the beginning of the game.

4736
05:00:58,119 --> 05:00:59,159
Right, right, right.

4737
05:00:59,159 --> 05:00:59,659
Of course.

4738
05:01:03,439 --> 05:01:04,000
Of course.

4739
05:01:05,279 --> 05:01:08,919
Go for the elbow.

4740
05:01:09,720 --> 05:01:15,959
Oh, it was the forearm again.

4741
05:01:18,810 --> 05:01:25,159
You gotta watch this.

4742
05:01:28,119 --> 05:01:34,220
There it is.

4743
05:01:34,220 --> 05:01:34,939
Another shoulder.

4744
05:01:36,939 --> 05:01:37,900
Yeah, kick him in the shoulder.

4745
05:01:39,020 --> 05:01:40,939
We see that one all the time.

4746
05:01:41,740 --> 05:01:43,259
The exploded collarbone.

4747
05:01:43,259 --> 05:01:44,380
It's very, very loud.

4748
05:01:45,500 --> 05:01:47,259
Burn left.

4749
05:01:47,819 --> 05:01:49,599
Oh, no, they're going up the middle.

4750
05:01:49,599 --> 05:01:50,639
They're going right up the middle.

4751
05:02:02,009 --> 05:02:03,529
Mortal Kombat wishes it was this gross.

4752
05:02:03,529 --> 05:02:05,049
Well, this is what I was talking about.

4753
05:02:05,049 --> 05:02:07,290
When I was talking about how the new Mortal Kombat games,

4754
05:02:07,290 --> 05:02:08,409
after this game came out,

4755
05:02:09,209 --> 05:02:11,849
they started doing that, like disgusting stuff.

4756
05:02:25,099 --> 05:02:26,380
Listen, why?

4757
05:02:26,380 --> 05:02:27,900
This dude didn't have to do it.

4758
05:02:28,860 --> 05:02:30,060
He just fell.

4759
05:02:30,060 --> 05:02:31,979
Oh, I fucking don't even know what to say.

4760
05:02:33,900 --> 05:02:40,159
The dude just fucking rolled over

4761
05:02:40,159 --> 05:02:41,840
and his collarbone exploded.

4762
05:02:44,830 --> 05:02:49,479
What is it?

4763
05:02:49,479 --> 05:02:49,979
What is it?

4764
05:02:57,959 --> 05:02:59,159
Was Ed Boon the dev?

4765
05:02:59,159 --> 05:03:00,040
I don't actually don't know.

4766
05:03:01,000 --> 05:03:02,279
This is an old Midway game.

4767
05:03:03,000 --> 05:03:06,279
I'm not sure if Ed had anything to do with it,

4768
05:03:06,279 --> 05:03:07,400
but watch out for the guy on the left.

4769
05:03:12,729 --> 05:03:13,229
Perfect.

4770
05:03:19,069 --> 05:03:19,630
Take it to him.

4771
05:03:19,630 --> 05:03:20,590
That's all it is.

4772
05:03:20,590 --> 05:03:21,869
Just keep your head in the game.

4773
05:03:21,869 --> 05:03:22,369
All right.

4774
05:03:22,990 --> 05:03:23,229
All right.

4775
05:03:23,229 --> 05:03:24,270
Can I actually win this one?

4776
05:03:31,389 --> 05:03:32,349
No, I don't even know what I did.

4777
05:03:32,349 --> 05:03:32,849
I tried to.

4778
05:03:33,959 --> 05:03:34,459
No, no.

4779
05:03:44,669 --> 05:03:45,389
The same guy.

4780
05:03:46,029 --> 05:03:47,389
Same guy, same shoulder.

4781
05:03:48,590 --> 05:03:56,759
They got the ball back.

4782
05:03:58,009 --> 05:03:58,970
We're going to go to overtime.

4783
05:04:03,279 --> 05:04:04,479
Oh, is that just the first quarter?

4784
05:04:10,509 --> 05:04:11,470
Third and 31.

4785
05:04:11,470 --> 05:04:12,509
No, we just keep going.

4786
05:04:12,509 --> 05:04:13,069
Second quarter.

4787
05:04:17,279 --> 05:04:22,299
No, I don't think I could see that.

4788
05:04:22,299 --> 05:04:23,900
I could smell you from a mile away.

4789
05:04:24,619 --> 05:04:27,040
I knew exactly what the hell you were doing.

4790
05:04:27,040 --> 05:04:31,619
I'll tell you what.

4791
05:04:41,000 --> 05:04:46,200
Thank you.

4792
05:04:46,200 --> 05:04:51,599
We got a ball spike.

4793
05:04:52,319 --> 05:05:07,919
That's the worst one.

4794
05:05:08,479 --> 05:05:12,200
I'm going muscle.

4795
05:05:12,200 --> 05:05:12,680
I'm going to go.

4796
05:05:13,880 --> 05:05:15,919
I have meter.

4797
05:05:15,919 --> 05:05:16,560
Let's go right in the middle.

4798
05:05:21,680 --> 05:05:31,569
I'm up.

4799
05:05:32,029 --> 05:05:32,860
I'm up.

4800
05:05:32,860 --> 05:05:33,099
I'm up.

4801
05:05:33,099 --> 05:05:33,340
I'm up.

4802
05:05:33,340 --> 05:05:33,840
I'm up.

4803
05:05:37,790 --> 05:05:38,750
No, Jeremy.

4804
05:05:38,750 --> 05:05:40,029
What the heck are you doing?

4805
05:05:40,830 --> 05:05:42,520
Just try to catch it.

4806
05:05:42,520 --> 05:05:45,000
I'm so hell bent on da.

4807
05:05:45,000 --> 05:05:45,639
Whatever.

4808
05:05:45,639 --> 05:05:46,139
Fuck.

4809
05:05:49,840 --> 05:05:55,389
I was trying to like dive into him and it's okay.

4810
05:05:56,270 --> 05:05:58,590
Now we are on a completely even playing field.

4811
05:05:59,709 --> 05:06:01,549
Safety in the beginning of the game does not matter now.

4812
05:06:15,819 --> 05:06:19,599
They've got an he's got a goddamn power here.

4813
05:06:34,270 --> 05:06:36,430
All right, we both have unleash.

4814
05:06:38,400 --> 05:06:38,880
Red zone.

4815
05:06:38,880 --> 05:06:39,360
We're going to go.

4816
05:06:43,599 --> 05:06:47,119
I don't want to use my unleash.

4817
05:06:47,119 --> 05:06:47,680
I want him to.

4818
05:06:51,139 --> 05:06:53,299
Wait, is that me?

4819
05:06:56,380 --> 05:06:57,099
No, thank God.

4820
05:06:57,099 --> 05:06:57,580
That's not me.

4821
05:06:59,409 --> 05:06:59,909
Okay.

4822
05:07:00,529 --> 05:07:02,959
I thought that was the end of the career again.

4823
05:07:02,959 --> 05:07:03,680
Thank God.

4824
05:07:04,400 --> 05:07:05,439
So now I have it.

4825
05:07:05,439 --> 05:07:06,560
See if I can convert this.

4826
05:07:08,700 --> 05:07:09,259
Nice play.

4827
05:07:18,720 --> 05:07:24,049
That's exactly what I wanted.

4828
05:07:25,009 --> 05:07:25,509
No.

4829
05:07:30,659 --> 05:07:31,619
It was for the team.

4830
05:07:32,259 --> 05:07:33,659
You did it for the team.

4831
05:07:36,450 --> 05:07:38,049
That was the guy that did the super tackle.

4832
05:07:39,169 --> 05:07:53,279
Triangle, square, square, triangle.

4833
05:07:53,279 --> 05:07:54,000
I'll try it next time.

4834
05:08:04,060 --> 05:08:04,560
Oops.

4835
05:08:05,500 --> 05:08:06,000
No.

4836
05:08:06,639 --> 05:08:21,040
Can I just play a game of football without having one of my bones explode?

4837
05:08:21,040 --> 05:08:39,279
Can I play everybody?

4838
05:08:39,279 --> 05:08:43,040
It's just like a 40% chance that if you get tackled,

4839
05:08:43,040 --> 05:08:45,439
your collarbone is going to blow up.

4840
05:08:46,959 --> 05:08:48,080
Just I got it.

4841
05:08:48,080 --> 05:08:49,040
He's the quarterback.

4842
05:08:51,139 --> 05:08:53,299
I'm the quarterback and I'm the safety.

4843
05:08:53,299 --> 05:08:54,979
Can I put him on the bench for the game?

4844
05:09:05,169 --> 05:09:06,049
God damn it.

4845
05:09:06,689 --> 05:09:11,380
I have to keep him away completely away from harm's way.

4846
05:09:12,180 --> 05:09:13,650
That means more runs.

4847
05:09:31,840 --> 05:09:33,919
Yeah, that bone heals in like five rounds.

4848
05:09:33,919 --> 05:09:35,759
If you get any injury, it's over.

4849
05:09:47,220 --> 05:09:49,700
Now I'm so terrified to even get involved in a play

4850
05:09:50,979 --> 05:09:53,540
because if I roll over out of bed like an old lady,

4851
05:09:54,580 --> 05:09:56,259
I'm going to get hurt.

4852
05:09:57,060 --> 05:10:08,680
That was good.

4853
05:10:12,479 --> 05:10:12,979
No.

4854
05:10:13,279 --> 05:10:13,779
No.

4855
05:10:14,720 --> 05:10:19,080
He's the quarterback.

4856
05:10:23,619 --> 05:10:25,299
Okay, seriously.

4857
05:10:26,419 --> 05:10:28,900
How am I with the quarterback?

4858
05:10:29,860 --> 05:10:30,500
I just had to...

4859
05:10:36,720 --> 05:10:38,159
Oh, come on.

4860
05:10:38,159 --> 05:10:39,279
He keeps dying.

4861
05:10:43,490 --> 05:10:48,259
Okay, so I'm going to run at every play.

4862
05:10:55,040 --> 05:10:56,880
I'm just going to hand it off to...

4863
05:10:56,880 --> 05:10:58,159
And they're going to take the fall for me.

4864
05:11:00,279 --> 05:11:01,319
Don't run it.

4865
05:11:01,319 --> 05:11:03,479
When I pass it, if I get hit, it's over.

4866
05:11:04,340 --> 05:11:08,419
I need to have my like halfback run and do like quick little slant plays

4867
05:11:08,979 --> 05:11:20,040
with these little things right here.

4868
05:11:20,200 --> 05:11:30,470
See, like it's everyone's made out of fucking paper.

4869
05:11:31,349 --> 05:11:33,169
Oh, no, it's that mean guy.

4870
05:11:33,889 --> 05:11:35,430
Who cares about this, dude?

4871
05:11:35,430 --> 05:11:36,229
Just get the touchdown.

4872
05:11:38,069 --> 05:11:43,490
Was it the square triangle, square triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square.

4873
05:11:44,529 --> 05:11:45,090
All right.

4874
05:11:45,090 --> 05:12:00,560
And the quarters, they're lasting a long time.

4875
05:12:02,080 --> 05:12:10,680
Triangle, square, square, triangle.

4876
05:12:10,680 --> 05:12:13,759
Okay, it was triangle, square, triangle.

4877
05:12:13,759 --> 05:12:15,279
It was triangle, square, square, triangle.

4878
05:12:15,279 --> 05:12:17,439
Okay, triangle, square, square, triangle.

4879
05:12:18,240 --> 05:12:18,959
There he is again.

4880
05:12:19,119 --> 05:12:27,159
There he is again.

4881
05:12:28,500 --> 05:12:28,979
That guy.

4882
05:12:28,979 --> 05:12:33,139
Inmate 274594866252784.

4883
05:12:33,139 --> 05:12:33,860
Doing a great job.

4884
05:12:35,060 --> 05:12:50,500
Now you're out forever.

4885
05:12:53,860 --> 05:12:54,340
Fourth down.

4886
05:12:54,900 --> 05:12:59,240
I'll use it if I have to.

4887
05:13:00,040 --> 05:13:16,119
Oh, turnover.

4888
05:13:16,119 --> 05:13:16,360
Good.

4889
05:13:19,860 --> 05:13:22,340
Just don't do a big pass.

4890
05:13:25,409 --> 05:13:26,689
See, like that, that's me.

4891
05:13:27,409 --> 05:13:28,849
That's me right now.

4892
05:13:28,849 --> 05:13:29,810
If that were...

4893
05:13:29,810 --> 05:13:30,849
If I had the ball still.

4894
05:13:31,409 --> 05:13:34,419
Who cares?

4895
05:13:34,419 --> 05:13:35,939
Forget about like the jobbers.

4896
05:13:35,939 --> 05:13:36,259
Like the...

4897
05:13:37,299 --> 05:13:38,419
Hulk Hogan used to fight.

4898
05:13:39,380 --> 05:13:40,500
Like a nameless dude.

4899
05:13:42,630 --> 05:13:43,349
Don't catch that.

4900
05:13:45,110 --> 05:13:50,150
Who cares about like the warm-up matches?

4901
05:13:50,790 --> 05:13:56,150
Down shit.

4902
05:13:56,709 --> 05:14:00,500
Oh man, we got to do this all day.

4903
05:14:01,060 --> 05:14:02,020
Let's get up, man.

4904
05:14:02,020 --> 05:14:02,659
Come on.

4905
05:14:02,659 --> 05:14:03,060
All right.

4906
05:14:09,009 --> 05:14:11,970
See, everyone's getting their skull fractured.

4907
05:14:13,330 --> 05:14:19,779
What are they feeding us in here?

4908
05:14:20,659 --> 05:14:23,650
Whatever it is, it's not nutritious at all.

4909
05:14:28,479 --> 05:14:29,599
Nice catch, Tucker.

4910
05:14:33,009 --> 05:14:35,409
My character cannot put his hands on the ball.

4911
05:14:37,909 --> 05:14:38,950
I'm serious at this point.

4912
05:14:38,950 --> 05:14:41,110
I just have to run the clock out and try to play defense.

4913
05:14:44,209 --> 05:14:55,200
Didn't work.

4914
05:14:55,200 --> 05:14:57,599
I think I have to unlock them or something.

4915
05:15:04,720 --> 05:15:06,439
It's all right.

4916
05:15:06,439 --> 05:15:07,720
I'm up by 12 points.

4917
05:15:07,720 --> 05:15:14,549
And on defense too.

4918
05:15:14,549 --> 05:15:15,590
I can fall the wrong way.

4919
05:15:15,590 --> 05:15:16,709
I can roll the wrong way.

4920
05:15:17,750 --> 05:15:20,310
There's so many ways this goes wrong.

4921
05:15:21,110 --> 05:15:26,680
Clean.

4922
05:15:27,240 --> 05:15:28,360
Stay alive.

4923
05:15:28,360 --> 05:15:35,000
I got unleash.

4924
05:15:35,959 --> 05:15:37,759
Stay up.

4925
05:15:38,560 --> 05:15:40,880
That's probably only two halves.

4926
05:15:42,000 --> 05:15:49,119
Fumble.

4927
05:15:49,119 --> 05:15:51,919
Oh, I got squished.

4928
05:15:51,919 --> 05:15:52,319
Fumble.

4929
05:15:54,770 --> 05:15:55,090
Yes.

4930
05:16:03,779 --> 05:16:04,259
Okay.

4931
05:16:04,259 --> 05:16:04,580
Don't.

4932
05:16:05,459 --> 05:16:06,020
Just run.

4933
05:16:06,659 --> 05:16:07,220
Just run it.

4934
05:16:08,340 --> 05:16:19,400
I am up by a lot.

4935
05:16:20,279 --> 05:16:20,840
This long.

4936
05:16:22,919 --> 05:16:23,400
I don't.

4937
05:16:23,400 --> 05:16:24,360
I don't have to play.

4938
05:16:24,360 --> 05:16:25,959
I just have to survive.

4939
05:16:25,959 --> 05:16:27,799
This quarterback survived.

4940
05:16:34,959 --> 05:16:36,159
I could potentially turn it over.

4941
05:16:36,159 --> 05:16:36,880
No, I'm not going to do that.

4942
05:16:37,439 --> 05:16:38,400
I think it's like a half, right?

4943
05:16:44,419 --> 05:16:46,880
Okay.

4944
05:16:47,520 --> 05:16:48,799
18 to zero.

4945
05:16:48,799 --> 05:16:49,520
First quarter time.

4946
05:16:55,040 --> 05:16:56,080
All they have to do is kill me.

4947
05:16:56,799 --> 05:16:59,119
But as long as I keep myself out of harm's way, it's not going to happen.

4948
05:16:59,680 --> 05:17:04,720
Let's try to get the ball converted here.

4949
05:17:09,319 --> 05:17:14,240
I'm so concerned.

4950
05:17:15,119 --> 05:17:16,340
I got to kill that guy.

4951
05:17:16,340 --> 05:17:16,659
I know.

4952
05:17:16,659 --> 05:17:16,979
I know.

4953
05:17:16,979 --> 05:17:18,020
I know I got to kill this guy.

4954
05:17:18,900 --> 05:17:29,029
Doesn't matter.

4955
05:17:29,029 --> 05:17:31,040
Just always stay one step ahead.

4956
05:17:36,209 --> 05:17:39,220
Use it.

4957
05:17:40,740 --> 05:17:43,990
I don't remember using my unleash.

4958
05:17:45,139 --> 05:17:46,500
And Jeremy, why are you passing?

4959
05:17:51,939 --> 05:17:53,139
Thank God it wasn't.

4960
05:17:53,139 --> 05:17:54,500
It was this random asshole.

4961
05:18:14,979 --> 05:18:15,860
Classic beer chug.

4962
05:18:15,860 --> 05:18:16,180
Let's go.

4963
05:18:18,229 --> 05:18:19,430
I don't care about my team.

4964
05:18:19,430 --> 05:18:19,990
No, I don't.

4965
05:18:21,380 --> 05:18:22,099
Because there's no...

4966
05:18:25,299 --> 05:18:25,939
Nothing happened.

4967
05:18:26,740 --> 05:18:27,619
This is not my team.

4968
05:18:30,400 --> 05:18:31,279
I need to stay alive.

4969
05:18:39,560 --> 05:18:39,880
Okay.

4970
05:18:50,470 --> 05:18:52,580
Like this is probably the one.

4971
05:18:52,580 --> 05:19:02,400
We're not going to get any phantom players.

4972
05:19:02,400 --> 05:19:04,319
We're not going to get any broken necks.

4973
05:19:06,000 --> 05:19:13,729
He jumped over me.

4974
05:19:13,729 --> 05:19:15,810
Don't do any unnecessary dives with that character.

4975
05:19:16,369 --> 05:19:32,069
Let's go with the muscle again just to fake around.

4976
05:19:33,189 --> 05:19:33,590
That...

4977
05:19:33,590 --> 05:19:34,630
They have an unleash.

4978
05:19:34,630 --> 05:19:35,990
This is a guaranteed injury.

4979
05:19:40,709 --> 05:19:40,950
See?

4980
05:19:41,830 --> 05:19:43,220
They didn't use it.

4981
05:19:59,270 --> 05:19:59,509
Nice.

4982
05:20:04,209 --> 05:20:04,610
Okay.

4983
05:20:05,250 --> 05:20:06,130
Things are looking up.

4984
05:20:09,349 --> 05:20:10,069
Rushing attack.

4985
05:20:10,950 --> 05:20:11,750
Get rid of the ball!

4986
05:20:12,790 --> 05:20:13,669
Just don't be right.

4987
05:20:23,169 --> 05:20:24,529
Oh my God.

4988
05:20:24,529 --> 05:20:26,759
If I had to do this again.

4989
05:20:27,319 --> 05:20:30,529
I might have just had a heart attack.

4990
05:20:30,529 --> 05:20:32,610
I seriously thought I was going to have to do this all over again.

4991
05:20:32,610 --> 05:20:34,209
Look at how far we are into the game.

4992
05:20:49,639 --> 05:20:50,279
Where are my...

4993
05:20:51,000 --> 05:20:52,119
It's getting weird again.

4994
05:20:52,119 --> 05:20:52,599
I don't have...

4995
05:21:04,959 --> 05:21:05,919
No, it's getting weird.

4996
05:21:09,279 --> 05:21:11,119
People are walking in random directions and shit.

4997
05:21:11,119 --> 05:21:11,360
Okay.

4998
05:21:11,360 --> 05:21:12,560
I got to stop him here and that should be game.

4999
05:21:15,400 --> 05:21:19,880
Bingo.

5000
05:21:21,540 --> 05:21:22,500
Just run the ball.

5001
05:21:22,500 --> 05:21:23,860
Just run the clock out.

5002
05:21:23,860 --> 05:21:24,979
Just do balanced.

5003
05:21:24,979 --> 05:21:25,139
Just...

5004
05:21:26,580 --> 05:21:28,979
Just run it.

5005
05:21:29,619 --> 05:21:31,110
Who cares?

5006
05:21:33,669 --> 05:21:38,419
Pretty sick.

5007
05:21:43,169 --> 05:21:43,810
No timeouts.

5008
05:21:44,369 --> 05:21:44,770
I don't know.

5009
05:21:44,770 --> 05:21:45,330
What did I just do?

5010
05:21:45,330 --> 05:21:45,970
What play was that?

5011
05:21:46,770 --> 05:21:47,889
What play was that?

5012
05:21:48,849 --> 05:21:55,750
It's actually halftime.

5013
05:21:59,459 --> 05:22:00,020
He just was like,

5014
05:22:00,020 --> 05:22:01,619
Oh shit, I'm not supposed to have this ball.

5015
05:22:01,619 --> 05:22:02,259
You take it.

5016
05:22:03,139 --> 05:22:08,819
You actually have to play through all four quarters like this.

5017
05:22:10,099 --> 05:22:29,959
All I need is just to keep...

5018
05:22:29,959 --> 05:22:30,520
Stay ahead.

5019
05:22:32,200 --> 05:22:33,560
This is why you spec tank.

5020
05:22:34,439 --> 05:22:36,529
Yeah, I did not do that.

5021
05:22:36,529 --> 05:22:37,009
You're right.

5022
05:22:38,209 --> 05:22:45,459
All of my points went into tackling and what?

5023
05:22:45,459 --> 05:22:46,180
Like strength.

5024
05:22:47,299 --> 05:22:55,250
All right.

5025
05:22:55,250 --> 05:22:56,209
They don't get a touchdown in this game.

5026
05:22:57,169 --> 05:22:57,970
No, it's not true.

5027
05:22:58,930 --> 05:23:00,040
It's close.

5028
05:23:00,040 --> 05:23:02,740
We're number one down.

5029
05:23:02,740 --> 05:23:03,139
Perfect.

5030
05:23:03,779 --> 05:23:06,659
Dermot is so stressed.

5031
05:23:06,659 --> 05:23:08,180
He hasn't made a joke in like an hour.

5032
05:23:09,619 --> 05:23:11,779
Yeah, because I want to get out of the prison arc.

5033
05:23:12,900 --> 05:23:21,139
Oh, I broke his spine by punching him in the face.

5034
05:23:22,419 --> 05:23:28,150
How do you play?

5035
05:23:28,150 --> 05:23:30,310
That was some Mortal Kombat uppercut shit there.

5036
05:23:35,400 --> 05:23:37,560
That was Scorpion does that.

5037
05:23:39,159 --> 05:23:41,569
Doesn't that move that Scorpion does?

5038
05:23:44,580 --> 05:23:46,659
Self is a better player than me.

5039
05:23:46,740 --> 05:23:48,819
Well, I'm playing very timidly because I don't want to die.

5040
05:23:49,700 --> 05:23:53,490
No, I haven't passed the ball.

5041
05:24:06,529 --> 05:24:07,330
Self doing the work.

5042
05:24:07,330 --> 05:24:07,729
That's great.

5043
05:24:09,830 --> 05:24:15,060
Self, he almost had it.

5044
05:24:15,060 --> 05:24:15,540
No, was that?

5045
05:24:15,540 --> 05:24:16,340
No, that wasn't self.

5046
05:24:17,380 --> 05:24:28,419
All right.

5047
05:24:28,419 --> 05:24:30,259
I was going for a little bit of a play there.

5048
05:24:31,459 --> 05:24:42,049
Turnover.

5049
05:24:43,009 --> 05:24:44,209
They can't get by the defense.

5050
05:24:44,209 --> 05:24:44,770
This is good.

5051
05:24:46,470 --> 05:24:46,950
Same deal.

5052
05:25:19,189 --> 05:25:19,669
Hubert.

5053
05:25:21,349 --> 05:25:24,069
I'm not quite a lot though.

5054
05:25:25,200 --> 05:25:25,439
No.

5055
05:25:35,939 --> 05:25:37,299
Boomer overconfident.

5056
05:25:39,830 --> 05:25:40,869
Wait, is that?

5057
05:25:40,869 --> 05:25:42,069
No, I don't know.

5058
05:25:42,069 --> 05:25:42,630
It doesn't matter.

5059
05:25:42,630 --> 05:25:43,590
I'm up by so much.

5060
05:25:43,590 --> 05:25:44,150
It doesn't matter.

5061
05:25:53,729 --> 05:25:54,369
I don't want this.

5062
05:26:03,799 --> 05:26:04,439
Right to self.

5063
05:26:07,430 --> 05:26:11,110
Okay, just right through the middle.

5064
05:26:18,290 --> 05:26:19,090
Fourth quarter.

5065
05:26:19,090 --> 05:26:19,810
We're almost done.

5066
05:26:21,830 --> 05:26:22,389
No, no, no.

5067
05:26:22,389 --> 05:26:25,430
Give me something easy right here.

5068
05:26:33,830 --> 05:26:34,549
Really?

5069
05:26:34,549 --> 05:26:41,779
That was kind of stupid.

5070
05:26:42,740 --> 05:26:43,830
Let's go.

5071
05:26:45,110 --> 05:26:48,819
That guy's dead.

5072
05:26:49,540 --> 05:27:17,139
I was trying to taunt, run, and it's the same stick as juke.

5073
05:27:17,139 --> 05:27:19,540
If it doesn't show up on the screen, you juke instead.

5074
05:27:45,279 --> 05:27:47,919
Made that look so good.

5075
05:27:47,919 --> 05:27:49,439
But holy shit, was it bad.

5076
05:27:55,000 --> 05:27:55,720
I got this.

5077
05:27:57,029 --> 05:27:59,349
That looked real cool for how bad it actually was.

5078
05:28:07,830 --> 05:28:08,150
All right.

5079
05:28:08,150 --> 05:28:10,869
I need to stop this nonsense and fucking win the goddamn game.

5080
05:28:10,869 --> 05:28:16,880
Again, he jumped up again and missed it again.

5081
05:28:19,189 --> 05:28:19,669
It's all right.

5082
05:28:19,669 --> 05:28:21,590
He needs like two more touchdowns.

5083
05:28:21,590 --> 05:28:23,110
It's not going to happen.

5084
05:28:23,110 --> 05:28:25,750
See, it's not going to happen.

5085
05:28:25,750 --> 05:28:29,509
My patrol officer says I got to control my anger.

5086
05:28:29,509 --> 05:28:30,069
Fuck that.

5087
05:28:30,790 --> 05:28:33,439
I'm going to get one right here.

5088
05:28:35,139 --> 05:28:42,709
Oh my god, what a fucking hero.

5089
05:28:43,830 --> 05:28:44,310
Don't do it.

5090
05:28:46,630 --> 05:28:47,270
I got it.

5091
05:28:49,270 --> 05:28:50,069
He ran out of gas.

5092
05:28:50,069 --> 05:28:50,549
It's okay.

5093
05:28:51,110 --> 05:28:52,150
We're going right up the middle.

5094
05:29:03,319 --> 05:29:03,799
Same thing, dude.

5095
05:29:03,799 --> 05:29:04,759
Again, exact same play.

5096
05:29:04,759 --> 05:29:05,479
They're not ready for it.

5097
05:29:08,229 --> 05:29:11,639
I got it.

5098
05:29:11,639 --> 05:29:12,200
Across the plane.

5099
05:29:13,889 --> 05:29:15,409
Now it's impossible for them to win.

5100
05:29:25,159 --> 05:29:26,520
Imagine if I broke my back there.

5101
05:29:28,360 --> 05:29:29,639
I would have shit my pants.

5102
05:29:30,439 --> 05:29:55,830
I got to kill the quarterback.

5103
05:29:55,830 --> 05:29:56,229
I have to.

5104
05:29:59,680 --> 05:30:07,360
Okay, I don't.

5105
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:08,639
The play doesn't matter.

5106
05:30:08,639 --> 05:30:09,360
Just get rid of it.

5107
05:30:10,080 --> 05:30:27,680
I win.

5108
05:30:27,680 --> 05:30:28,159
It's over.

5109
05:30:34,240 --> 05:30:35,169
Early release.

5110
05:30:35,169 --> 05:30:36,610
The warden is pleased with your good behavior

5111
05:30:36,610 --> 05:30:39,569
and has arranged for your sentence to be reduced to time served.

5112
05:30:39,569 --> 05:30:40,049
You're free.

5113
05:30:42,529 --> 05:30:45,759
That was the real Super Bowl.

5114
05:30:46,479 --> 05:30:51,970
What about self?

5115
05:30:51,970 --> 05:30:52,849
Can self get out too?

5116
05:30:56,400 --> 05:31:00,529
Trade offer to be traded.

5117
05:31:00,529 --> 05:31:01,939
Hey, Ashwin.

5118
05:31:03,279 --> 05:31:03,759
Oh, what?

5119
05:31:03,759 --> 05:31:07,270
Oh, I can get Cho from.

5120
05:31:08,439 --> 05:31:08,840
All right.

5121
05:31:08,840 --> 05:31:09,639
That's insane.

5122
05:31:10,279 --> 05:31:11,319
Why would you want this?

5123
05:31:11,319 --> 05:31:12,279
Why would you give this to me?

5124
05:31:13,880 --> 05:31:16,119
Oh, I can pick anybody from.

5125
05:31:18,259 --> 05:31:18,659
I see.

5126
05:31:19,299 --> 05:31:22,119
From the last division.

5127
05:31:22,119 --> 05:31:25,110
All right, who do I got?

5128
05:31:25,110 --> 05:31:25,669
What do I got?

5129
05:31:25,669 --> 05:31:27,830
B minus for wide receiver.

5130
05:31:27,830 --> 05:31:28,869
What do I need improvement here?

5131
05:31:30,979 --> 05:31:31,619
Halfback.

5132
05:31:31,619 --> 05:31:32,419
Robbie died.

5133
05:31:32,419 --> 05:31:37,830
So wide receiver.

5134
05:31:37,830 --> 05:31:38,470
Wallace.

5135
05:31:38,470 --> 05:31:39,029
Look at that.

5136
05:31:39,750 --> 05:31:43,110
That's a huge upgrade.

5137
05:31:43,750 --> 05:31:45,909
We're going to go with Wallace.

5138
05:31:48,849 --> 05:31:49,889
Or Sullivan.

5139
05:31:51,040 --> 05:31:52,080
No, Wallace definitely.

5140
05:31:52,639 --> 05:31:56,319
Wait, hold on.

5141
05:31:56,319 --> 05:31:56,959
This is Cookie.

5142
05:31:56,959 --> 05:31:58,560
Wasn't he bad?

5143
05:31:58,560 --> 05:32:01,319
Doesn't Cookie bring the whole team down?

5144
05:32:05,939 --> 05:32:07,779
The only thing that will happen if I bring on Cho

5145
05:32:07,779 --> 05:32:09,700
is everybody will sleep with his wife, right?

5146
05:32:18,979 --> 05:32:20,740
That's what happened the last time.

5147
05:32:21,299 --> 05:32:21,939
Something like that.

5148
05:32:22,580 --> 05:32:29,919
It's tough to get rid of a B minus for an A minus.

5149
05:32:30,880 --> 05:32:32,880
I'd rather get rid of like a C for an A.

5150
05:32:33,840 --> 05:32:34,639
What about Sullivan?

5151
05:32:34,639 --> 05:32:37,520
No, we got to keep Robbie back from the dead.

5152
05:32:38,159 --> 05:32:39,909
Defensive.

5153
05:32:39,909 --> 05:32:40,709
What a latch off.

5154
05:32:41,270 --> 05:32:42,630
This is a defensive tackle.

5155
05:32:43,430 --> 05:32:44,790
Kind of necessary.

5156
05:32:49,650 --> 05:32:50,529
96 strength.

5157
05:32:52,119 --> 05:32:53,080
82 tackle.

5158
05:32:53,799 --> 05:33:00,919
I'm going to take Cho.

5159
05:33:02,369 --> 05:33:03,330
Or the tackle.

5160
05:33:05,000 --> 05:33:07,159
C plus versus an A minus.

5161
05:33:07,720 --> 05:33:08,599
Way more strength.

5162
05:33:09,319 --> 05:33:11,669
Yeah, we need some more defense.

5163
05:33:12,389 --> 05:33:16,229
I'm going for Latcho.

5164
05:33:24,610 --> 05:33:25,330
Robbie's dead.

5165
05:33:25,330 --> 05:33:26,049
We get rid of him.

5166
05:33:26,049 --> 05:33:27,409
Dump Robbie's corpse.

5167
05:33:28,130 --> 05:33:32,630
Dump Robbie's corpse.

5168
05:33:33,189 --> 05:33:35,250
I mean, this is true.

5169
05:33:35,250 --> 05:33:36,049
He's dead.

5170
05:33:36,049 --> 05:33:41,520
Was Sullivan a team player?

5171
05:33:41,520 --> 05:33:49,319
We have to bury him.

5172
05:33:49,319 --> 05:33:49,799
He died.

5173
05:33:52,959 --> 05:33:57,560
Plus, an A minus halfback is ridiculous.

5174
05:33:57,560 --> 05:33:57,799
Done.

5175
05:34:01,669 --> 05:34:03,430
I know we're going to keep him for the meme,

5176
05:34:03,430 --> 05:34:06,950
but guys, the halfback is one of the most important players in the whole field.

5177
05:34:06,950 --> 05:34:08,279
Robbie's gone.

5178
05:34:08,279 --> 05:34:15,430
An A minus halfback.

5179
05:34:15,430 --> 05:34:22,470
You saw his neck explode.

5180
05:34:22,470 --> 05:34:23,189
That's good news.

5181
05:34:23,750 --> 05:34:25,430
Listen, you should know.

5182
05:34:25,430 --> 05:34:27,990
It's going to take a while to rebuild relationships,

5183
05:34:27,990 --> 05:34:30,069
both with sponsors and with me,

5184
05:34:30,069 --> 05:34:31,830
but I'm willing to stick with it if you are.

5185
05:34:31,830 --> 05:34:35,990
And hey, I just want to make sure that everyone's aware of this.

5186
05:34:37,110 --> 05:34:39,590
Robbie got injured every five plays.

5187
05:34:41,090 --> 05:34:44,450
So he was actually really on the field,

5188
05:34:44,450 --> 05:34:48,500
maybe like 50 to 60 percent of the time.

5189
05:34:48,500 --> 05:34:52,470
So did you really like Robbie?

5190
05:34:55,159 --> 05:34:56,439
He did make a few good plays,

5191
05:34:57,459 --> 05:35:00,439
but I mean, very though.

5192
05:35:00,439 --> 05:35:12,630
I'm going to pick you up busy trying to line you up some news.

5193
05:35:12,630 --> 05:35:15,990
You do know all the old sponsors bailed when you were convicted, right?

5194
05:35:15,990 --> 05:35:17,349
I didn't even know the sponsors.

5195
05:35:17,349 --> 05:35:19,590
But don't worry, because you work your magic on the field,

5196
05:35:19,590 --> 05:35:21,590
I'll do mine off the field and I will be forgiven.

5197
05:35:22,470 --> 05:35:26,369
Okay, so I got a question for those of you

5198
05:35:26,369 --> 05:35:28,049
that are in the stream hanging out here still.

5199
05:35:30,419 --> 05:35:35,650
Would anybody be against me beating this campaign?

5200
05:35:36,639 --> 05:35:37,840
Maybe not necessarily tonight,

5201
05:35:37,840 --> 05:35:44,720
but like next stream?

5202
05:35:44,880 --> 05:35:46,560
Would anybody think that that was a bad idea?

5203
05:35:47,200 --> 05:35:52,529
Because I forgot just how much fun this was.

5204
05:35:54,840 --> 05:36:00,290
Okay, so next stream, we're going to continue this.

5205
05:36:02,740 --> 05:36:04,419
I'm not stopping yet, by the way.

5206
05:36:06,500 --> 05:36:08,819
I just know that I'm not going to be able to get it done this stream.

5207
05:36:12,240 --> 05:36:14,159
So sorry, I couldn't pick you up from the slam.

5208
05:36:14,880 --> 05:36:17,520
Franchise must perform three different touchdown celebrations.

5209
05:36:18,500 --> 05:36:20,500
Next game, I got to do three different celebrations.

5210
05:36:20,500 --> 05:36:21,380
Do I unlock them?

5211
05:36:22,259 --> 05:36:23,509
Oh, okay, hold on a second.

5212
05:36:23,509 --> 05:36:23,990
Let me look at this.

5213
05:36:27,680 --> 05:36:31,169
Ace Attorney next year.

5214
05:36:31,169 --> 05:36:33,919
No, no, no.

5215
05:36:33,919 --> 05:36:39,430
So we got it was half back, right?

5216
05:36:39,430 --> 05:36:42,419
That's me and I'm a B right now.

5217
05:36:43,139 --> 05:36:46,400
There's Sullivan, the new halfback.

5218
05:36:49,029 --> 05:36:49,830
Bernie Cox.

5219
05:36:50,549 --> 05:36:53,139
How do I delete this character?

5220
05:36:53,779 --> 05:36:55,459
How do I trade this one?

5221
05:36:55,459 --> 05:36:56,259
Can I just delete them?

5222
05:36:56,900 --> 05:37:01,279
All right, we got a good halfback.

5223
05:37:01,279 --> 05:37:02,560
Fullback, not so good.

5224
05:37:03,119 --> 05:37:07,009
This guy's terrible.

5225
05:37:07,569 --> 05:37:09,520
I need some better receivers.

5226
05:37:09,520 --> 05:37:11,759
Ashwin's, that's why I didn't want to get rid of Ashwin.

5227
05:37:11,759 --> 05:37:16,950
Because B minus is the only, all these other guys suck.

5228
05:37:18,630 --> 05:37:19,110
Tight end.

5229
05:37:19,830 --> 05:37:23,299
Did this back up the B minus?

5230
05:37:23,299 --> 05:37:23,939
That's not bad.

5231
05:37:27,409 --> 05:37:29,490
Punter, my punter's not, the kicker's not bad.

5232
05:37:30,369 --> 05:37:31,729
I have a pretty decent kicker in punter.

5233
05:37:32,369 --> 05:37:38,720
I could have got Cookie,

5234
05:37:38,720 --> 05:37:40,479
but Cookie would have brought the whole team down.

5235
05:37:40,479 --> 05:37:46,069
Let's go to the trainer upgrades.

5236
05:37:46,709 --> 05:37:49,220
So I have 400, I need hands.

5237
05:37:49,220 --> 05:37:50,580
I told you this is the first thing I was going to do.

5238
05:37:51,700 --> 05:37:52,500
Grip master.

5239
05:37:53,220 --> 05:37:53,939
Do it.

5240
05:37:53,939 --> 05:38:01,860
Which leaves me with turbo jets.

5241
05:38:01,860 --> 05:38:03,060
I can't, I can't put anything else.

5242
05:38:03,060 --> 05:38:03,939
We can take drugs.

5243
05:38:04,740 --> 05:38:07,189
Train automatically.

5244
05:38:07,189 --> 05:38:08,229
What do we got?

5245
05:38:08,229 --> 05:38:18,040
So let me give, where is Sullivan?

5246
05:38:18,040 --> 05:38:18,439
There we go.

5247
05:38:18,439 --> 05:38:21,939
Okay, Sullivan's going to take decreased clash drain.

5248
05:38:21,939 --> 05:38:23,220
That sounds pretty good for a halfback.

5249
05:38:23,939 --> 05:38:26,580
Turbo bar drain slower.

5250
05:38:26,580 --> 05:38:28,099
That's really good for a halfback.

5251
05:38:28,099 --> 05:38:28,340
Yeah.

5252
05:38:29,060 --> 05:38:30,560
Wait, what's with the team risk?

5253
05:38:30,560 --> 05:38:32,799
Oh no, I just got in trouble for taking drugs.

5254
05:38:32,799 --> 05:38:36,099
How do I take those off?

5255
05:38:38,560 --> 05:38:41,680
Fuck.

5256
05:38:41,680 --> 05:38:47,619
I just got out of prison and I can't remove it.

5257
05:38:47,619 --> 05:38:49,139
I am going back to jail, I think.

5258
05:38:50,610 --> 05:38:53,720
Los Angeles riot is the next game.

5259
05:38:53,720 --> 05:38:57,319
Need to win five games to advance.

5260
05:39:02,900 --> 05:39:06,580
They're a much better team.

5261
05:39:07,139 --> 05:39:11,490
Las Vegas must stay within 11 points at the final score.

5262
05:39:14,869 --> 05:39:18,439
Look at how much better of a team they are.

5263
05:39:19,000 --> 05:39:19,479
Let's go.

5264
05:39:20,360 --> 05:39:23,000
Finally, we get to play the Los Angeles riot.

5265
05:39:23,560 --> 05:39:25,560
Our beloved commissioner's dream team.

5266
05:39:26,279 --> 05:39:29,479
The captain of this gang of all-stars is Bruno Bataglia.

5267
05:39:29,479 --> 05:39:31,720
Veteran linebacker and all-around asshole.

5268
05:39:32,439 --> 05:39:36,200
Bataglia surgically upgraded his elbow with a titanium replacement.

5269
05:39:37,159 --> 05:39:40,919
Not good considering the man already wrote the book on cheap shots.

5270
05:39:40,919 --> 05:39:43,639
Every Sunday he writes another chapter.

5271
05:39:45,349 --> 05:39:46,869
All right, be careful.

5272
05:39:46,869 --> 05:39:48,869
Titanium bionic elbow guy.

5273
05:39:55,919 --> 05:39:57,680
Titanium people's elbow.

5274
05:39:58,400 --> 05:40:05,479
Helmets become mandatory.

5275
05:40:15,479 --> 05:40:17,560
It's weird because this game actually still holds up pretty well.

5276
05:40:17,560 --> 05:40:18,919
Hi and thanks for joining us.

5277
05:40:20,180 --> 05:40:21,939
Nearly, what, 10, 15 years later?

5278
05:40:22,740 --> 05:40:24,599
It's a nice field.

5279
05:40:25,319 --> 05:40:30,180
Does it?

5280
05:40:30,180 --> 05:40:30,979
Yeah, I think it does.

5281
05:40:34,580 --> 05:40:35,080
Elbow.

5282
05:40:37,040 --> 05:40:42,229
Good luck.

5283
05:40:42,229 --> 05:40:42,709
See you later.

5284
05:40:47,880 --> 05:40:50,119
Fractured wrist out for eight games.

5285
05:40:51,159 --> 05:40:52,439
Say goodbye to your special teams.

5286
05:40:56,200 --> 05:40:57,880
So we're going to get a balanced defense here.

5287
05:40:58,520 --> 05:41:03,799
I got to be careful on offense because that's their captain.

5288
05:41:08,049 --> 05:41:08,529
Blocked it.

5289
05:41:09,729 --> 05:41:11,799
Still got it.

5290
05:41:11,799 --> 05:41:13,000
That was a 10% hit too.

5291
05:41:14,360 --> 05:41:15,840
Is this my new guy?

5292
05:41:17,990 --> 05:41:19,029
I think that, is that the new guy?

5293
05:41:19,750 --> 05:41:23,110
No, no, no, no.

5294
05:41:23,110 --> 05:41:23,830
He's a halfback.

5295
05:41:23,830 --> 05:41:24,330
Never mind.

5296
05:41:37,509 --> 05:41:38,549
This is where I gotta be careful.

5297
05:41:38,549 --> 05:41:41,990
So we have, he's right up the middle.

5298
05:41:50,610 --> 05:41:51,810
Holy shit, you still got it.

5299
05:41:53,810 --> 05:41:54,529
Better hands.

5300
05:41:55,569 --> 05:41:56,689
We've seen bounces.

5301
05:41:57,889 --> 05:41:58,770
Yeah, Madden's back.

5302
05:41:58,770 --> 05:41:59,569
We'll fake Madden.

5303
05:42:01,090 --> 05:42:07,040
Thank God I got away from him.

5304
05:42:09,459 --> 05:42:10,099
And there he is.

5305
05:42:14,240 --> 05:42:14,959
There's Sullivan.

5306
05:42:15,680 --> 05:42:22,930
Worth the pick up for sure.

5307
05:42:23,490 --> 05:42:28,020
You see how well he dodged there?

5308
05:42:28,020 --> 05:42:28,580
Team captain.

5309
05:42:29,299 --> 05:42:30,180
Nah, he's gonna field goal.

5310
05:42:38,840 --> 05:42:39,799
I almost just blew that one.

5311
05:42:42,130 --> 05:42:43,250
Very different celebrations.

5312
05:42:43,250 --> 05:42:43,750
Yep.

5313
05:42:44,290 --> 05:42:47,360
I think I have to unlock them somehow.

5314
05:42:48,080 --> 05:42:55,000
When's the next bathroom break?

5315
05:42:55,959 --> 05:42:57,880
There probably will not be a bathroom break.

5316
05:42:58,439 --> 05:42:59,779
Oh my goodness.

5317
05:43:00,419 --> 05:43:06,900
There will probably be an end of the stream for the next break, technically.

5318
05:43:07,779 --> 05:43:09,459
Bathroom's closed.

5319
05:43:12,689 --> 05:43:16,369
No game, good.

5320
05:43:18,680 --> 05:43:19,639
End of the stream P.

5321
05:43:25,040 --> 05:43:25,540
Haha.

5322
05:43:26,720 --> 05:43:31,700
Really kept that.

5323
05:43:33,700 --> 05:43:34,500
Still no first down.

5324
05:43:38,819 --> 05:43:40,529
Kill the other team captain odd.

5325
05:43:41,330 --> 05:43:42,369
Gotta get the ball first.

5326
05:43:43,090 --> 05:43:43,889
He's on defense.

5327
05:43:47,700 --> 05:43:48,790
Where you at?

5328
05:43:48,790 --> 05:43:49,290
Where you at?

5329
05:43:50,229 --> 05:43:54,000
He's got all the time in the world.

5330
05:43:55,430 --> 05:43:56,229
Kill him.

5331
05:43:56,229 --> 05:43:57,189
Kill their quarterback.

5332
05:44:02,529 --> 05:44:03,029
Yes.

5333
05:44:03,569 --> 05:44:09,669
Bruce Kinney out of the game.

5334
05:44:11,479 --> 05:44:12,680
Out for five plays.

5335
05:44:12,680 --> 05:44:13,240
That sucks.

5336
05:44:13,959 --> 05:44:17,060
Well, and they're punting.

5337
05:44:17,060 --> 05:44:36,610
And he's tackled at the 35th and so at the end of one quarter play.

5338
05:44:36,610 --> 05:44:37,729
I could have turned that into something crazy.

5339
05:44:37,729 --> 05:44:39,650
Las Vegas leads by seven.

5340
05:44:40,689 --> 05:44:42,869
That was a pretty decent play.

5341
05:44:44,209 --> 05:44:45,650
I have to get into that end zone.

5342
05:44:48,849 --> 05:44:54,020
He goes way downfield and he makes the crack.

5343
05:44:54,020 --> 05:44:55,299
And they make the attack.

5344
05:44:55,299 --> 05:44:58,500
Las Vegas with a nice game there thanks to some key downfield blocks.

5345
05:44:58,500 --> 05:44:59,459
Just pissing a draw?

5346
05:45:00,580 --> 05:45:02,150
What pissing a draw?

5347
05:45:03,029 --> 05:45:13,029
Let's get the ball to Sullivan.

5348
05:45:13,029 --> 05:45:13,669
New halfback.

5349
05:45:15,110 --> 05:45:16,869
What's going on?

5350
05:45:20,849 --> 05:45:23,250
Sullivan with a fucking beautiful catch.

5351
05:45:31,939 --> 05:45:32,979
We're pretty close.

5352
05:45:32,979 --> 05:45:34,020
Let's hit the end zone.

5353
05:45:34,580 --> 05:45:37,909
He should be able to run it right in.

5354
05:45:39,349 --> 05:45:41,500
It's okay.

5355
05:45:41,959 --> 05:45:44,619
Tongue?

5356
05:45:45,319 --> 05:45:45,819
Tongue?

5357
05:45:47,159 --> 05:45:47,639
You see that?

5358
05:45:47,639 --> 05:45:49,560
I've seen more gains in my mutual fun.

5359
05:45:50,360 --> 05:45:51,319
Not really.

5360
05:45:51,319 --> 05:45:52,680
That's just as pathetic.

5361
05:45:53,799 --> 05:45:57,189
Looks like his tongue is hanging out.

5362
05:45:57,189 --> 05:45:57,689
Do you see that?

5363
05:46:01,490 --> 05:46:02,770
Las Vegas covers it up.

5364
05:46:04,369 --> 05:46:04,869
Fuck.

5365
05:46:06,680 --> 05:46:07,639
Thank god for that guy.

5366
05:46:07,639 --> 05:46:08,200
I can get there.

5367
05:46:08,200 --> 05:46:08,599
Damn!

5368
05:46:08,599 --> 05:46:09,880
That wasn't very cordial.

5369
05:46:10,759 --> 05:46:11,259
Get in there.

5370
05:46:28,520 --> 05:46:29,479
He's your brother?

5371
05:46:29,479 --> 05:46:31,240
Big series of downs upcoming.

5372
05:46:31,959 --> 05:46:38,209
Touchdown!

5373
05:46:38,209 --> 05:46:39,090
Different celebrations!

5374
05:46:39,090 --> 05:46:42,259
Las Vegas now leads by 13.

5375
05:46:42,259 --> 05:46:42,759
Dead.

5376
05:46:43,139 --> 05:46:51,619
Sorry, I got too confused there.

5377
05:46:51,619 --> 05:46:58,229
Point is good.

5378
05:46:58,229 --> 05:46:59,909
That was awesome.

5379
05:47:01,319 --> 05:47:02,040
LA Riot.

5380
05:47:02,759 --> 05:47:03,560
Better team.

5381
05:47:03,560 --> 05:47:05,319
You don't get the chemistry that I do.

5382
05:47:06,200 --> 05:47:08,369
You got the stats on paper,

5383
05:47:08,369 --> 05:47:10,130
but you don't get the heart I do.

5384
05:47:15,189 --> 05:47:16,560
See you in the second half.

5385
05:47:17,540 --> 05:47:19,299
And with the first half of the books,

5386
05:47:19,299 --> 05:47:21,459
Las Vegas leads by 14.

5387
05:47:22,419 --> 05:47:24,740
Should have made the bet.

5388
05:47:24,740 --> 05:47:27,060
Yeah, look at the stat difference though.

5389
05:47:27,860 --> 05:47:30,900
I figured it was going to be difficult.

5390
05:47:31,619 --> 05:47:34,500
It was like a one and 14 that I had trouble with.

5391
05:47:34,500 --> 05:47:35,540
Not like the LA Riot.

5392
05:47:36,599 --> 05:47:37,099
Somehow.

5393
05:47:37,799 --> 05:47:42,119
Oh, he should be careful.

5394
05:47:43,000 --> 05:47:43,500
Stay back.

5395
05:47:50,560 --> 05:47:52,159
I'm gonna bingo.

5396
05:47:54,720 --> 05:47:57,840
Did I just break that tackle?

5397
05:47:58,799 --> 05:47:59,299
Oh no!

5398
05:48:00,000 --> 05:48:12,180
It's just a sprained neck.

5399
05:48:12,180 --> 05:48:13,779
It's not a broken neck.

5400
05:48:13,779 --> 05:48:15,509
It's not a broken neck.

5401
05:48:16,069 --> 05:48:17,509
I was about to be very sad.

5402
05:48:24,020 --> 05:48:25,779
83% hit being in two places.

5403
05:48:28,099 --> 05:48:30,020
Oh man, if this was a neck and shadow,

5404
05:48:30,020 --> 05:48:31,220
that would have been so sad.

5405
05:48:31,220 --> 05:48:32,740
I would have actually been so sad.

5406
05:48:34,020 --> 05:48:36,529
We got a new half back in.

5407
05:48:37,729 --> 05:48:39,299
First down.

5408
05:48:39,299 --> 05:48:40,020
Don't really care about.

5409
05:48:44,529 --> 05:48:45,650
He almost died.

5410
05:48:46,610 --> 05:48:47,250
No, he didn't.

5411
05:48:47,250 --> 05:48:48,049
He's going boys.

5412
05:48:48,049 --> 05:48:49,970
Okay, four new downs to play with.

5413
05:48:49,970 --> 05:48:50,930
It's just tight stretch.

5414
05:48:53,400 --> 05:48:54,200
Oh, it is caught.

5415
05:48:54,919 --> 05:48:57,750
He's going long.

5416
05:48:59,029 --> 05:48:59,750
Who the hell was that?

5417
05:48:59,750 --> 05:49:00,790
Whoever they are, they're getting a raise.

5418
05:49:01,830 --> 05:49:02,919
Touchdown!

5419
05:49:02,919 --> 05:49:04,979
Las Vegas increases their lead.

5420
05:49:04,979 --> 05:49:05,479
Who is it?

5421
05:49:06,180 --> 05:49:06,740
Number 80.

5422
05:49:07,459 --> 05:49:12,759
Let's get a two-point conversion here.

5423
05:49:15,349 --> 05:49:18,549
He is going.

5424
05:49:19,430 --> 05:49:26,099
They can't even score any points.

5425
05:49:26,979 --> 05:49:31,220
I need to celebrate.

5426
05:49:31,220 --> 05:49:31,619
I couldn't.

5427
05:49:31,619 --> 05:49:32,180
I got tackled.

5428
05:49:32,900 --> 05:49:33,459
I got tackled.

5429
05:49:33,459 --> 05:49:34,419
If you get tackled in the end zone,

5430
05:49:34,419 --> 05:49:35,139
you can't celebrate.

5431
05:49:36,099 --> 05:49:38,759
I might not be able to get it this game.

5432
05:49:39,799 --> 05:49:44,720
Prison arc worked.

5433
05:49:47,400 --> 05:49:48,439
Well, what's this?

5434
05:49:48,439 --> 05:49:49,159
Las Vegas?

5435
05:49:49,159 --> 05:49:49,959
Better than LA?

5436
05:49:50,759 --> 05:49:54,000
Quarterback is in the game again.

5437
05:49:54,000 --> 05:49:54,240
This is...

5438
05:49:54,240 --> 05:49:55,040
Oh, that's why.

5439
05:49:55,040 --> 05:49:55,680
That's why.

5440
05:49:55,680 --> 05:49:56,180
I get it.

5441
05:49:57,479 --> 05:49:58,840
They haven't been doing shit because of that.

5442
05:50:05,169 --> 05:50:06,209
Envy football.

5443
05:50:06,209 --> 05:50:06,709
L-U-L.

5444
05:50:11,189 --> 05:50:12,389
The prison was the pit.

5445
05:50:13,189 --> 05:50:14,470
In the dark night.

5446
05:50:20,209 --> 05:50:22,450
Could I have gotten up potentially and caught that ball?

5447
05:50:23,330 --> 05:50:25,729
All right.

5448
05:50:25,729 --> 05:50:26,130
Let's do...

5449
05:50:27,250 --> 05:50:28,290
We're going to deep zones.

5450
05:50:35,520 --> 05:50:37,119
At today's section.

5451
05:50:37,119 --> 05:50:39,759
Let's try it.

5452
05:50:39,759 --> 05:50:41,680
The only other thing I can think of is that the quarterback must have thought

5453
05:50:41,680 --> 05:50:42,799
it was opposite day on that.

5454
05:50:42,799 --> 05:50:43,759
Tackle again.

5455
05:50:43,759 --> 05:50:44,560
Now people say,

5456
05:50:44,560 --> 05:50:47,040
sorry, I guess today must be opposite day when they screw up.

5457
05:50:47,040 --> 05:50:48,959
But for it really to be opposite day,

5458
05:50:48,959 --> 05:50:49,680
wouldn't it have to be?

5459
05:50:49,680 --> 05:50:50,479
Probably back in the game.

5460
05:50:53,400 --> 05:50:54,919
Crucial series of downs here.

5461
05:50:54,919 --> 05:50:59,919
He lets it fly.

5462
05:51:00,560 --> 05:51:01,040
Complete.

5463
05:51:01,840 --> 05:51:05,520
Un-voided, but I didn't even need to do my meter.

5464
05:51:07,840 --> 05:51:10,119
I wish I bet on this game.

5465
05:51:10,119 --> 05:51:12,840
Ever had that acid reflux, you know, with the heartburn and then,

5466
05:51:12,840 --> 05:51:13,880
you know, with the rest of it?

5467
05:51:18,520 --> 05:51:19,319
What are you going to do?

5468
05:51:19,319 --> 05:51:20,709
The extra point is good.

5469
05:51:21,590 --> 05:51:23,360
That's Ashwin, yeah.

5470
05:51:23,360 --> 05:51:24,240
Glad I didn't get rid of him.

5471
05:51:25,360 --> 05:51:33,700
I'm going to fail the challenge.

5472
05:51:33,700 --> 05:51:34,259
It's okay.

5473
05:51:34,259 --> 05:51:34,580
Don't worry.

5474
05:51:34,580 --> 05:51:35,380
You're going to see an injury.

5475
05:51:36,740 --> 05:51:37,459
That was just me.

5476
05:51:40,360 --> 05:51:41,799
The bet was to win by 11.

5477
05:51:43,599 --> 05:51:44,479
Holy shit.

5478
05:51:44,479 --> 05:51:47,119
10 community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.

5479
05:51:48,639 --> 05:51:50,689
This one's for you.

5480
05:51:50,689 --> 05:51:51,889
Thank you so much for the 10 subs.

5481
05:51:52,689 --> 05:52:02,819
Now that, that's a, that's a pog champ scenario, I think.

5482
05:52:03,459 --> 05:52:08,849
Could have caught it.

5483
05:52:08,849 --> 05:52:09,409
That meter.

5484
05:52:11,779 --> 05:52:12,340
Third down.

5485
05:52:13,060 --> 05:52:14,659
Bounce it out, little boys and girls.

5486
05:52:24,450 --> 05:52:26,849
Another 10 community subs from AmScoots.

5487
05:52:28,930 --> 05:52:30,130
10 community subs.

5488
05:52:30,130 --> 05:52:30,689
Back to back.

5489
05:52:32,959 --> 05:52:33,919
Thank you to the both of you.

5490
05:52:35,330 --> 05:52:36,130
10 community.

5491
05:52:36,130 --> 05:52:36,770
10 community.

5492
05:52:37,409 --> 05:52:39,439
You guys are fucking amazing.

5493
05:52:39,439 --> 05:52:39,759
Thank you.

5494
05:52:40,319 --> 05:52:43,810
Where are you going?

5495
05:52:43,810 --> 05:52:44,689
Why did he run that way?

5496
05:52:55,040 --> 05:52:55,840
I got an unleashed.

5497
05:52:56,479 --> 05:53:00,180
I got a sonic unleashed.

5498
05:53:00,180 --> 05:53:00,740
They do too.

5499
05:53:01,619 --> 05:53:02,819
Here comes the end of the third quarter.

5500
05:53:02,819 --> 05:53:03,779
Last play of the quarter.

5501
05:53:05,189 --> 05:53:05,689
And...

5502
05:53:13,110 --> 05:53:13,909
I didn't catch that.

5503
05:53:16,869 --> 05:53:18,069
I did not catch that ball.

5504
05:53:19,590 --> 05:53:21,669
And yeah, they should be chanting bullshit.

5505
05:53:21,669 --> 05:53:22,069
I would too.

5506
05:53:23,189 --> 05:53:27,139
Let's go for a run.

5507
05:53:27,139 --> 05:53:28,180
See if I can get it in the end zone.

5508
05:53:33,680 --> 05:53:34,720
No, no, no, no.

5509
05:53:45,840 --> 05:53:47,439
Oh, he's out for four games.

5510
05:53:47,439 --> 05:53:48,000
Come on.

5511
05:53:49,270 --> 05:53:52,630
That's, they're only like five, seven games in a season.

5512
05:53:55,759 --> 05:53:56,639
That's not good.

5513
05:53:58,720 --> 05:54:00,639
Now my 80 is going to have to step up.

5514
05:54:00,639 --> 05:54:01,360
That's Ashwin.

5515
05:54:12,560 --> 05:54:14,159
Ashwin really pulling it up here.

5516
05:54:14,159 --> 05:54:15,599
Miles on some more points.

5517
05:54:20,180 --> 05:54:21,619
The halfback Kirk.

5518
05:54:23,619 --> 05:54:24,740
Who's the halfback right now?

5519
05:54:24,740 --> 05:54:25,459
Cox?

5520
05:54:25,459 --> 05:54:26,740
All right, let's hope he gets his...

5521
05:54:26,740 --> 05:54:27,619
Let's hope he gets like his...

5522
05:54:33,569 --> 05:54:35,409
No, don't do an onside kick.

5523
05:54:35,409 --> 05:54:36,369
How do I change that?

5524
05:54:37,009 --> 05:54:49,169
It's all right.

5525
05:54:49,169 --> 05:54:50,689
I'm going to put 35 to nothing.

5526
05:54:51,409 --> 05:54:52,450
Everything's going to be just fine.

5527
05:54:53,490 --> 05:54:58,310
I, I'm going to put...

5528
05:54:58,310 --> 05:54:59,750
I'm going to go in the medical tent or whatever.

5529
05:55:00,709 --> 05:55:01,430
Put him in there.

5530
05:55:11,270 --> 05:55:12,869
I'm digging it deep.

5531
05:55:13,590 --> 05:55:14,759
They're getting desperate.

5532
05:55:17,880 --> 05:55:24,279
Is this the last game of the night?

5533
05:55:24,279 --> 05:55:25,799
This is going to be the last game of the night.

5534
05:55:25,799 --> 05:55:26,759
That is what's going to happen.

5535
05:55:28,119 --> 05:55:32,520
Figured it's probably a pretty good stopping place to beat Los Angeles as Las Vegas.

5536
05:55:35,970 --> 05:55:47,400
We will pick back up with this game because I, I am having a blast.

5537
05:55:47,400 --> 05:55:47,880
I love it.

5538
05:55:48,759 --> 05:55:50,119
And we're probably about...

5539
05:55:50,119 --> 05:55:56,360
We probably beat the halfway point of the campaign in the next game or two.

5540
05:55:57,400 --> 05:55:58,919
So, might as well just keep it going and...

5541
05:56:00,520 --> 05:56:02,360
Okay.

5542
05:56:02,360 --> 05:56:10,200
Have they haven't unleashed this whole game?

5543
05:56:10,200 --> 05:56:12,919
Well, they haven't really had possession of the ball for very long.

5544
05:56:19,110 --> 05:56:20,310
No conversion for you.

5545
05:56:22,150 --> 05:56:26,159
Did I get a ball crush yet?

5546
05:56:26,159 --> 05:56:26,720
Yes, I did.

5547
05:56:27,279 --> 05:56:28,000
Few times now.

5548
05:56:30,880 --> 05:56:31,830
That's not good.

5549
05:56:32,790 --> 05:56:35,349
He held onto it and he's not injured.

5550
05:56:35,349 --> 05:56:35,849
Good.

5551
05:56:36,869 --> 05:56:37,750
Got his revenge.

5552
05:56:43,400 --> 05:56:44,520
Two ball crushes.

5553
05:56:44,520 --> 05:56:45,020
Yeah.

5554
05:56:46,119 --> 05:56:50,209
Looking for, looking for, looking for somebody, looking for somebody.

5555
05:56:50,209 --> 05:56:50,709
Just go!

5556
05:57:11,159 --> 05:57:12,040
Cox getting in there.

5557
05:57:13,319 --> 05:57:13,819
Do it again.

5558
05:57:19,479 --> 05:57:23,240
Wow, that was fucking cool.

5559
05:57:25,080 --> 05:57:26,040
Um, um, hold on.

5560
05:57:26,040 --> 05:57:26,520
What is it?

5561
05:57:26,520 --> 05:57:27,479
I need to do one more, right?

5562
05:57:28,279 --> 05:57:29,000
I haven't done knockout.

5563
05:57:29,000 --> 05:57:30,200
Square, square, triangle, triangle.

5564
05:57:31,479 --> 05:57:33,299
That should be it.

5565
05:57:34,500 --> 05:57:39,720
Got it, right?

5566
05:57:40,340 --> 05:57:45,619
Do it again.

5567
05:57:48,340 --> 05:57:50,099
Just beat the fuck out of your own teammate.

5568
05:57:53,990 --> 05:57:55,509
Yeah, I thought I could stop him.

5569
05:57:56,740 --> 05:57:58,180
I thought I could stop him but I couldn't.

5570
05:57:58,819 --> 05:58:00,790
This game's over.

5571
05:58:01,349 --> 05:58:03,330
Start of the season 1-0.

5572
05:58:12,389 --> 05:58:15,319
It was a big hit but not enough to do an injury.

5573
05:58:20,549 --> 05:58:22,790
I think franchise has to do the celebrations.

5574
05:58:22,790 --> 05:58:23,290
Oh.

5575
05:58:25,810 --> 05:58:27,250
Well that, I don't think that's gonna happen then.

5576
05:58:28,130 --> 05:58:28,930
First and third.

5577
05:58:28,930 --> 05:58:29,569
Don't think so.

5578
05:58:32,520 --> 05:58:33,720
Do the philosophy mode.

5579
05:58:35,400 --> 05:58:37,409
Dirty hit on the floor.

5580
05:58:37,409 --> 05:58:37,909
That sack.

5581
05:58:45,889 --> 05:58:47,409
Well here's the injury potential right here.

5582
05:58:49,970 --> 05:58:51,409
Let's just go for a super blitz.

5583
05:58:53,159 --> 05:58:54,279
Just like a blitz.

5584
05:58:55,810 --> 05:58:56,310
Everybody.

5585
05:58:57,189 --> 05:58:57,689
All in.

5586
05:59:08,500 --> 05:59:08,979
You know what?

5587
05:59:08,979 --> 05:59:12,520
Like fucking field goal block.

5588
05:59:24,040 --> 05:59:24,840
He got it again.

5589
05:59:32,259 --> 05:59:37,400
Well I think I can stop it right here.

5590
05:59:40,919 --> 05:59:44,099
What a beautiful turnaround.

5591
05:59:44,099 --> 05:59:45,939
And there goes another broken frog wrist.

5592
05:59:47,060 --> 05:59:52,000
And that's the end of the game.

5593
05:59:54,979 --> 05:59:55,459
See you.

5594
05:59:55,459 --> 05:59:56,419
I'll see you in hell.

5595
06:00:02,209 --> 06:00:03,409
I get one more play here.

5596
06:00:04,869 --> 06:00:05,909
Hail Mary into the end zone.

5597
06:00:05,909 --> 06:00:07,509
See if I can win by like 50 points.

5598
06:00:12,900 --> 06:00:13,400
Cox!

5599
06:00:17,799 --> 06:00:18,840
Get in there Cox!

5600
06:00:24,819 --> 06:00:29,139
Too bad.

5601
06:00:29,139 --> 06:00:33,680
There's a lot of yards though.

5602
06:00:36,439 --> 06:00:37,479
There's a lot of achievements.

5603
06:00:38,279 --> 06:00:39,729
Probably a decent amount of money too.

5604
06:00:45,599 --> 06:00:46,240
No wager.

5605
06:00:46,799 --> 06:00:47,360
Oh well.

5606
06:00:47,360 --> 06:00:48,080
392.

5607
06:00:48,639 --> 06:00:49,040
Awesome.

5608
06:00:51,779 --> 06:00:52,979
Magic hands trophy.

5609
06:00:56,319 --> 06:00:58,319
And that's I think they're like the division leader.

5610
06:01:00,959 --> 06:01:03,680
I'm pretty sure I think that's like the antagonist in the whole game.

5611
06:01:04,479 --> 06:01:18,500
You just lost.

5612
06:01:27,330 --> 06:01:28,369
The ones that lost.

5613
06:01:34,610 --> 06:01:35,090
Slow down.

5614
06:01:35,970 --> 06:01:37,090
That's two shots in a row.

5615
06:01:39,540 --> 06:01:40,099
Slow down!

5616
06:01:48,799 --> 06:01:50,479
That's four shots of vodka?

5617
06:01:56,919 --> 06:01:57,720
He doesn't know.

5618
06:02:07,540 --> 06:02:08,099
Punch.

5619
06:02:08,979 --> 06:02:09,700
Three.

5620
06:02:09,700 --> 06:02:09,939
Two.

5621
06:02:21,189 --> 06:02:25,299
I'm gonna get fined.

5622
06:02:34,720 --> 06:02:35,520
Uh oh.

5623
06:02:35,520 --> 06:02:40,680
Franchise I gotta tell you this is not the way to endear yourself to potential new clients.

5624
06:02:40,680 --> 06:02:45,000
Sponsors are willing to overlook an arrest record but they still want winners!

5625
06:02:45,639 --> 06:02:49,240
Um dude I'm like fucking eight and one.

5626
06:02:51,119 --> 06:02:54,000
Hey man I hear you got a call from Tara a while back.

5627
06:02:54,000 --> 06:02:57,520
I know what she sounds like but trust me you're gonna want to meet with this girl.

5628
06:02:57,520 --> 06:02:59,680
She can hook you up with all kinds of shit.

5629
06:02:59,680 --> 06:03:02,880
And if she really likes what she sees she could be a real freak.

5630
06:03:02,880 --> 06:03:03,520
I think that's Cox.

5631
06:03:03,520 --> 06:03:04,159
You know what I mean.

5632
06:03:05,520 --> 06:03:09,759
Oh it's Bruno calling me now.

5633
06:03:09,759 --> 06:03:11,360
Hey punk how's it hanging?

5634
06:03:12,319 --> 06:03:17,990
Sorry I broke up your little love fest with sands but you know what they say the truth hurts.

5635
06:03:18,630 --> 06:03:22,229
When you're ready to leave that piece of shit team of yours and join the riot

5636
06:03:22,229 --> 06:03:23,509
give me a call.

5637
06:03:23,509 --> 06:03:25,189
Yeah I know the right people.

5638
06:03:25,430 --> 06:03:28,389
Hey Franchise got time for a meeting today?

5639
06:03:28,389 --> 06:03:31,750
I've got some paperwork for you to sign but trust me you're gonna like it.

5640
06:03:31,750 --> 06:03:36,709
You racked up over 200 yards on offense last Sunday and that got another big sponsor

5641
06:03:36,709 --> 06:03:39,349
beating down our door for your endorsement.

5642
06:03:39,349 --> 06:03:42,229
Award the pro cleats shoes by turf pros.

5643
06:03:42,229 --> 06:03:43,750
Let's take a look.

5644
06:03:43,750 --> 06:03:47,639
Protector, impact, crazy grip.

5645
06:03:47,639 --> 06:03:50,689
Pro cleats plus two speed.

5646
06:03:51,409 --> 06:03:52,130
Well I need them.

5647
06:03:52,770 --> 06:03:53,569
How much money do I have?

5648
06:03:53,569 --> 06:03:55,880
$392,000.

5649
06:03:56,520 --> 06:03:58,369
How much money do I have?

5650
06:03:58,369 --> 06:03:58,930
$392,000.

5651
06:04:00,659 --> 06:04:01,619
All right injuries.

5652
06:04:01,619 --> 06:04:02,500
I need this is where we need to.

5653
06:04:02,500 --> 06:04:06,880
Okay I need uh D Sullivan's got a broken collarbone.

5654
06:04:08,080 --> 06:04:08,799
Two games out.

5655
06:04:08,799 --> 06:04:09,520
One game out.

5656
06:04:10,479 --> 06:04:12,240
Get as many staff on him as I can.

5657
06:04:12,880 --> 06:04:16,099
Okay so now he's only gonna be up with one game.

5658
06:04:16,659 --> 06:04:23,240
What do we got for upgrades?

5659
06:04:23,880 --> 06:04:26,930
I think I want to do hands again.

5660
06:04:26,930 --> 06:04:30,180
No probably speed.

5661
06:04:30,180 --> 06:04:33,279
Yeah let's get speed to two.

5662
06:04:34,450 --> 06:04:36,130
I have no money now but it was worth it.

5663
06:04:38,639 --> 06:04:39,200
Girlfriends.

5664
06:04:40,000 --> 06:04:43,970
Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.

5665
06:04:44,689 --> 06:04:47,060
I got uh nobody else here.

5666
06:04:51,009 --> 06:04:51,889
Maybe training?

5667
06:04:52,529 --> 06:04:56,529
Do I have to meet with her or something?

5668
06:04:56,529 --> 06:05:06,479
Is there another place for me to do that?

5669
06:05:06,479 --> 06:05:07,040
Roster?

5670
06:05:07,040 --> 06:05:07,279
No.

5671
06:05:10,470 --> 06:05:12,310
This loser only has one girlfriend.

5672
06:05:12,950 --> 06:05:19,090
Nah I don't need to do this.

5673
06:05:19,090 --> 06:05:22,040
All right that's uh I think that's a good stopping point for now.

5674
06:05:22,040 --> 06:05:23,159
She's in the roster.

5675
06:05:23,799 --> 06:05:27,700
You have to equip the sponsored stuff.

5676
06:05:28,340 --> 06:05:32,450
So it's not just on.

5677
06:05:32,450 --> 06:05:34,209
So this actually this has to be equipped.

5678
06:05:37,400 --> 06:05:37,799
You sure?

5679
06:05:38,439 --> 06:05:55,479
I don't think so.

5680
06:05:56,200 --> 06:06:02,209
Yeah it's not here.

5681
06:06:03,250 --> 06:06:04,360
I think it's just on.

5682
06:06:11,520 --> 06:06:12,400
Shoes?

5683
06:06:12,400 --> 06:06:22,529
First name number oh I need a number nine.

5684
06:06:22,529 --> 06:06:25,939
Number is it double zero?

5685
06:06:26,979 --> 06:06:30,119
Or is 99 as high as you can go?

5686
06:06:33,990 --> 06:06:35,189
Change his colors.

5687
06:06:37,040 --> 06:06:37,840
90 is it?

5688
06:06:41,639 --> 06:06:42,520
85.

5689
06:06:42,520 --> 06:06:44,240
Yeah all right.

5690
06:06:44,240 --> 06:06:44,880
No I can't.

5691
06:06:44,880 --> 06:06:46,639
There's somebody on my team that's 85.

5692
06:06:46,639 --> 06:06:51,009
Then I can't do 69 either guys.

5693
06:06:51,650 --> 06:06:57,490
How about 50?

5694
06:06:58,049 --> 06:07:00,319
48.

5695
06:07:00,319 --> 06:07:03,040
48.

5696
06:07:03,040 --> 06:07:04,319
Yeah I think it's just already equipped.

5697
06:07:05,759 --> 06:07:06,880
But that's going to be it for tonight.

5698
06:07:08,000 --> 06:07:09,919
I am going to take the next couple days off.

5699
06:07:10,560 --> 06:07:13,599
We went three days in a row here.

5700
06:07:13,599 --> 06:07:15,439
So I was going to take one or two days off.

5701
06:07:16,259 --> 06:07:20,900
I got some stuff I need to take care of in the house.

5702
06:07:22,520 --> 06:07:27,319
So I will see you guys on say Sunday.

5703
06:07:27,319 --> 06:07:31,569
I will probably see you guys on Wednesday.

5704
06:07:31,569 --> 06:07:33,889
And I'm sorry to all the Ace Attorney fans.

5705
06:07:36,200 --> 06:07:40,229
But I kind of want I think I want to beat this.

5706
06:07:42,419 --> 06:07:43,380
It's so fun.

5707
06:07:44,790 --> 06:07:46,709
I had what a blast this was.

5708
06:07:46,709 --> 06:07:48,869
The last couple of streams is like Space Channel.

5709
06:07:49,669 --> 06:07:51,750
They've been great.

5710
06:07:51,750 --> 06:07:53,509
Not that not that other streams haven't been.

5711
06:07:53,509 --> 06:07:58,520
But game selection wise I think I've been having a lot of fun with the game selection.

5712
06:07:58,520 --> 06:08:00,360
The last like four or five straight.

5713
06:08:00,360 --> 06:08:06,200
Larry Resnick will two into like Crazy Taxi and Space Channel into this.

5714
06:08:06,200 --> 06:08:08,919
What a great selection of video games in the last two weeks.

5715
06:08:11,970 --> 06:08:15,090
After this Ace Attorney yes I will try to get that to work.

5716
06:08:15,090 --> 06:08:16,680
I'll get my audio splitter.

5717
06:08:19,680 --> 06:08:24,000
But that's going to be the end of tonight's stream.

5718
06:08:24,880 --> 06:08:30,520
So thank you all for watching.

5719
06:08:32,560 --> 06:08:33,680
Really appreciate it.

5720
06:08:33,680 --> 06:08:38,159
See you guys on Wednesday.

5721
06:08:38,159 --> 06:08:42,900
For those of you that came in late.

5722
06:08:43,700 --> 06:08:48,450
Yeah there's a you probably have no idea what this is.

5723
06:08:48,450 --> 06:08:49,650
But that's all right.

5724
06:08:49,650 --> 06:08:51,759
I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

5725
06:08:52,400 --> 06:08:53,380
Thanks for joining me.

5726
06:08:53,380 --> 06:08:55,619
And Patriots won the Super Bowl.

5727
06:08:55,619 --> 06:09:01,590
That's I guess that's as a Boston and New England guy.

5728
06:09:02,790 --> 06:09:07,220
Tom Brady now can put a ring in every one of his bedrooms.

5729
06:09:09,959 --> 06:09:12,680
Implying that Tom Brady probably doesn't have like a 12 bedroom house.

5730
06:09:12,680 --> 06:09:14,439
So he has to win at least six more Super Bowls.

5731
06:09:16,369 --> 06:09:17,009
His bathrooms.

5732
06:09:17,569 --> 06:09:20,099
He probably doesn't have more than six bathrooms in his house right.

5733
06:09:20,099 --> 06:09:21,540
So we can have a ring in each bathroom.

5734
06:09:22,180 --> 06:09:26,680
They can just like hang it on the like on the shower or something.

5735
06:09:26,680 --> 06:09:30,849
But anyways let's go through the bits.

5736
06:09:30,849 --> 06:09:31,830
See you guys Wednesday.

5737
06:09:31,830 --> 06:09:33,349
Thanks for hanging out.

5738
06:09:33,349 --> 06:09:35,669
That was Blitz the League 2 for PlayStation 3.

5739
06:09:36,389 --> 06:09:38,680
It is a very very very fun game.

5740
06:09:39,400 --> 06:09:40,759
Highly recommended.

5741
06:09:40,759 --> 06:09:41,720
And we will complete it.

5742
06:09:42,680 --> 06:09:44,040
Hopefully on Wednesday.

5743
06:09:45,040 --> 06:09:46,159
And stadium seating.

5744
06:09:46,159 --> 06:09:47,520
Thanks for four dollars stadium seating.

5745
06:09:48,080 --> 06:09:51,119
Hey Jerm, I just want to say you've helped me through so much

5746
06:09:51,119 --> 06:09:53,279
throughout these past years whenever I'm feeling down.

5747
06:09:53,279 --> 06:09:54,880
I've always been able to tune into the streams.

5748
06:09:55,759 --> 06:09:58,240
Or watch your videos on the old channel and laugh.

5749
06:09:58,240 --> 06:09:59,759
And you've helped me through tons.

5750
06:09:59,759 --> 06:10:02,599
Just want to say thank you bro.

5751
06:10:02,599 --> 06:10:04,119
Thank you stadium seating for the four dollars.

5752
06:10:06,130 --> 06:10:11,729
And I'm I'm fucking honored that I'm somebody you can say that about.

5753
06:10:11,729 --> 06:10:13,110
So thank you so much.

5754
06:10:13,750 --> 06:10:15,009
Much love to you.

5755
06:10:15,009 --> 06:10:15,810
Thanks for the four dollars.

5756
06:10:16,369 --> 06:10:20,200
That was a really good photo ship.

5757
06:10:20,200 --> 06:10:21,240
Yeah a lot of them work.

5758
06:10:23,090 --> 06:10:24,610
Some guy nine thanks for the five bucks.

5759
06:10:24,610 --> 06:10:26,290
All right it's almost 2 a.m here.

5760
06:10:26,290 --> 06:10:28,689
I got to get up early so I got to post this meme video.

5761
06:10:29,250 --> 06:10:30,529
And go the fuck to bed.

5762
06:10:31,330 --> 06:10:33,169
What's what's what's what's what the meme videos lately.

5763
06:10:33,970 --> 06:10:37,250
My audio is in the wrong spot.

5764
06:10:38,049 --> 06:10:40,159
I just scratched my monitor didn't I?

5765
06:10:41,040 --> 06:10:41,840
God damn it.

5766
06:10:41,840 --> 06:10:44,599
Oh I can buff that up.

5767
06:10:45,319 --> 06:10:46,119
Something's what is it?

5768
06:10:48,979 --> 06:10:50,880
If this is Phantom of the Opera.

5769
06:10:51,599 --> 06:10:53,040
I'm deleting my YouTube account.

5770
06:10:53,040 --> 06:11:12,529
Oh it's the it's the.

5771
06:11:12,529 --> 06:11:15,729

5773
06:11:24,040 --> 06:11:24,439
Just did it.

5774
06:11:24,439 --> 06:11:25,240
I clicked the two buttons.

5775
06:11:25,880 --> 06:11:27,090
Guys you don't understand.

5776
06:11:27,090 --> 06:11:29,490
There's a red button on on every desk I've ever owned.

5777
06:11:29,490 --> 06:11:31,490
That was delete all YouTube videos.

5778
06:11:34,759 --> 06:11:35,880
Every YouTuber has one.

5779
06:11:36,520 --> 06:11:39,650
You know just in case like they come for that.

5780
06:11:39,650 --> 06:11:41,409
They just give the they come for the files you know.

5781
06:11:43,680 --> 06:11:45,680
Somebody get like where are those videos?

5782
06:11:45,680 --> 06:11:49,119
Like in Mission Impossible.

5783
06:11:55,430 --> 06:11:56,790
The button didn't work.

5784
06:11:56,790 --> 06:11:59,830
Oh well and I got scammed out of like forty five thousand dollars.

5785
06:12:00,549 --> 06:12:08,200
Like they they're coming for like my secret codes.

5786
06:12:08,840 --> 06:12:14,279
You know what if somebody wants to take control of my channel.

5787
06:12:14,279 --> 06:12:16,759
Nope I haven't got the kill switch in there.

5788
06:12:22,310 --> 06:12:23,509
Thank you Jess for the one dollar.

5789
06:12:23,509 --> 06:12:25,669
Could you give me a new username change?

5790
06:12:26,310 --> 06:12:27,439
I can't think of anything.

5791
06:12:27,439 --> 06:12:29,040
I want to keep the Jess part.

5792
06:12:29,040 --> 06:12:36,069
Um how about uh how about Jess you got it.

5793
06:12:38,180 --> 06:12:38,900
Jess you got it.

5794
06:12:39,459 --> 06:12:44,880
It's a real that's a real firm handshake of the name I think.

5795
06:12:45,439 --> 06:12:52,439
Why is German so stinky?

5796
06:12:52,439 --> 06:12:53,639
Laughing my ass off.

5797
06:12:53,639 --> 06:12:54,599
You don't know what I smell like.

5798
06:12:55,240 --> 06:12:56,419
No idea.

5799
06:12:56,419 --> 06:12:58,439
Hopefully you like that new name.

5800
06:12:59,479 --> 06:13:01,159
Thank you Flugboy for the five dollars.

5801
06:13:01,159 --> 06:13:02,599
Super Bowl Sunday big love to you.

5802
06:13:02,599 --> 06:13:03,799
German thank you for being so great.

5803
06:13:03,799 --> 06:13:06,360
Also I'm gonna be the big 20 tomorrow.

5804
06:13:07,080 --> 06:13:08,919
Can't believe I've made it this far.

5805
06:13:08,919 --> 06:13:09,880
Hope you have a great night.

5806
06:13:09,880 --> 06:13:10,599
Happy birthday.

5807
06:13:11,560 --> 06:13:14,599
Yeah probably not sure what time zone you're in but happy birthday.

5808
06:13:16,869 --> 06:13:17,669
Big 20.

5809
06:13:18,389 --> 06:13:18,869
Two zero.

5810
06:13:20,819 --> 06:13:22,180
Thank you so much Flugboy.

5811
06:13:22,180 --> 06:13:22,979
Hope you have a good one.

5812
06:13:24,819 --> 06:13:27,139
Thank you creation the cyborg for the one dollar.

5813
06:13:27,139 --> 06:13:29,779
Hey German my grandfather died on January 30th.

5814
06:13:30,419 --> 06:13:32,580
Even though I never met him I was able to see photos.

5815
06:13:34,680 --> 06:13:37,880
Also the Wii died on the 30th and I bought my last Wii game.

5816
06:13:39,720 --> 06:13:41,479
Have a great day and let the Super Bowl begin.

5817
06:13:44,240 --> 06:13:45,520
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

5818
06:13:51,380 --> 06:13:52,659
Rest in peace to your grandfather.

5819
06:13:54,180 --> 06:13:54,900
Sorry to hear that.

5820
06:13:55,459 --> 06:13:58,819
But yeah the Super Bowl began the Super Bowl ended.

5821
06:14:03,599 --> 06:14:16,439
Patriots won.

5822
06:14:16,439 --> 06:14:18,360
Thank you Alec for the one dollar.

5823
06:14:18,360 --> 06:14:20,119
Hey German how do you like your steak cooked?

5824
06:14:22,119 --> 06:14:22,520
Medium.

5825
06:14:23,080 --> 06:14:26,549
Depending on what kind of cut of meat.

5826
06:14:26,549 --> 06:14:28,229
I don't really eat a whole lot of red meat.

5827
06:14:28,229 --> 06:14:32,659
I don't really eat a whole lot of steak because it upsets my stomach sometimes.

5828
06:14:33,639 --> 06:14:38,360
But like a medium to medium well depending on what the cut of meat it is.

5829
06:14:42,389 --> 06:14:45,110
But it's it's it for hamburgers though if you'd like a cheeseburger.

5830
06:14:45,830 --> 06:14:47,990
I liked my cheeseburgers cooked all the way through.

5831
06:14:49,060 --> 06:14:51,299
So if I get a steak I'd want it done medium.

5832
06:14:51,299 --> 06:14:55,139
But if I get a McDonald's hamburger it's not medium rare.

5833
06:14:55,939 --> 06:15:01,860
If I order a burger I usually just say whatever like you know medium or medium well.

5834
06:15:01,860 --> 06:15:05,139
But I like it usually cooked all the way through for a burger.

5835
06:15:06,979 --> 06:15:07,700
Medium wet.

5836
06:15:11,939 --> 06:15:16,819
So burgers medium well steak medium to chef's choice.

5837
06:15:16,819 --> 06:15:20,150
Hope that answers your question.

5838
06:15:20,709 --> 06:15:22,240
Tingy thanks for the one dollar.

5839
06:15:22,240 --> 06:15:23,919
The audio splitter got lost in the mail.

5840
06:15:23,919 --> 06:15:26,000
Probably got lost in the same place as the Pikachu socks.

5841
06:15:27,060 --> 06:15:28,180
Yeah I don't know something about the mail.

5842
06:15:28,740 --> 06:15:30,790
I don't know what it is mail.

5843
06:15:31,590 --> 06:15:32,599
Fucking mail.

5844
06:15:33,240 --> 06:15:38,630
You guys are gonna be like everyone's gonna laugh.

5845
06:15:39,349 --> 06:15:41,319
When I finally get that mail.

5846
06:15:41,319 --> 06:15:43,560
Thank you Beck PNG for the one dollar.

5847
06:15:43,560 --> 06:15:45,479
Hey Jerma I'm here to force you to look at fan art.

5848
06:15:46,360 --> 06:15:46,759
Sorry.

5849
06:15:47,939 --> 06:15:48,659
Sorry what?

5850
06:15:48,659 --> 06:15:50,819
I wanted to make you something a little more polished in color.

5851
06:15:50,819 --> 06:15:52,180
So here's there's here it is.

5852
06:15:52,740 --> 06:15:55,000
You stream the perfect background noise for drawing.

5853
06:15:55,000 --> 06:15:57,639
Though sometimes I end up laughing so hard I can't see the screen.

5854
06:15:57,639 --> 06:15:58,439
Thanks for that.

5855
06:15:58,439 --> 06:16:00,759
Also you need to know your hair is extremely fun to draw.

5856
06:16:01,799 --> 06:16:03,319
As is the rest of you.

5857
06:16:03,319 --> 06:16:04,520
Keep up the clownery.

5858
06:16:07,400 --> 06:16:07,959
Look at that.

5859
06:16:11,299 --> 06:16:16,240
All right they're like here I'm gonna put this like.

5860
06:16:20,549 --> 06:16:21,509
Look at this.

5861
06:16:21,509 --> 06:16:29,299
This is just like there are a lot of talented people.

5862
06:16:29,939 --> 06:16:32,000
That watch these streams.

5863
06:16:40,580 --> 06:16:42,500
I want to get it on the screen.

5864
06:16:42,500 --> 06:16:45,830
How do I do this?

5865
06:16:45,830 --> 06:16:47,110
Oh there we go.

5866
06:16:47,110 --> 06:16:53,720
Yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of talented.

5867
06:16:53,720 --> 06:16:55,639
Even just like the photoshop manipulation shit.

5868
06:16:56,439 --> 06:17:07,439
You guys are so quick with the art the artwork and the the edits and it's great.

5869
06:17:08,080 --> 06:17:13,990
I gotta turn this off.

5870
06:17:13,990 --> 06:17:14,630
Hold on.

5871
06:17:14,630 --> 06:17:19,200
I gotta put my gotta put my feet in the microwave.

5872
06:17:19,200 --> 06:17:19,680
There we go.

5873
06:17:20,319 --> 06:17:25,990
There it is.

5874
06:17:26,630 --> 06:17:34,849
Why would you do that?

5875
06:17:35,490 --> 06:17:37,189
Take a look at that.

5876
06:17:37,909 --> 06:17:42,560
This is this is just wonderful.

5877
06:17:43,200 --> 06:17:46,549
You guys are so talented.

5878
06:17:47,189 --> 06:17:51,569
Yeah make sure we get the Beck PNG right there.

5879
06:17:52,290 --> 06:17:59,430
This is like Jerma is Jerma the Disney character.

5880
06:18:00,310 --> 06:18:03,349
It's got that like old school Disney animated feel.

5881
06:18:03,349 --> 06:18:03,750
I love it.

5882
06:18:04,470 --> 06:18:15,040
Well done.

5883
06:18:15,040 --> 06:18:16,360
Thank you so much Beck.

5884
06:18:17,000 --> 06:18:23,590
That is absolutely phenomenal.

5885
06:18:23,590 --> 06:18:23,909
Thank you.

5886
06:18:28,000 --> 06:18:29,599
Now you're gonna be in Kingdom Hearts.

5887
06:18:30,159 --> 06:18:34,799
Yeah that's Beck PNG.

5888
06:18:34,799 --> 06:18:35,840
I don't know if Beck if you have.

5889
06:18:37,439 --> 06:18:39,680
Because you linked me like a Google Drive.

5890
06:18:39,680 --> 06:18:42,240
I don't know if you have a art page or something.

5891
06:18:42,240 --> 06:18:44,000
But go ahead if you if you have it link it.

5892
06:18:44,639 --> 06:18:47,810
But thank you.

5893
06:18:49,860 --> 06:18:51,459
Fantastic stuff.

5894
06:18:52,259 --> 06:18:56,369
Thank you Mr. Sneak Man for the dollar 30.

5895
06:18:57,009 --> 06:19:01,279
Hey Jerma been getting a lot of Dunkin Donuts ice coffees in the last three years

5896
06:19:01,279 --> 06:19:05,439
and I want and I want you to know that the one birthday TF2 video where you drank

5897
06:19:05,439 --> 06:19:09,119
blueberry iced coffee fueled my iced coffee spendings for three years and counting.

5898
06:19:09,680 --> 06:19:13,840
I especially like the five percent of the time when the coffee actually tastes good.

5899
06:19:14,720 --> 06:19:16,080
Favorite flavor of coffee.

5900
06:19:16,799 --> 06:19:19,799
Well that that's Dunkin Donuts.

5901
06:19:20,680 --> 06:19:24,680
Dunkin Donuts is like a doll of 60 for a coffee.

5902
06:19:24,680 --> 06:19:26,360
For like a medium iced coffee right.

5903
06:19:27,159 --> 06:19:28,479
But it's Dunkin Donuts.

5904
06:19:31,319 --> 06:19:33,799
My favorite flavor of Dunkin Donuts is blueberry.

5905
06:19:34,959 --> 06:19:36,799
Just that's what I used to drink it all the time.

5906
06:19:37,889 --> 06:19:43,779
But now I'm more of a I think I'm more of a classical English toffee kind of guy now.

5907
06:19:44,580 --> 06:19:52,520
But there you go.

5908
06:19:53,080 --> 06:19:56,479
Dunkin Donuts I do miss Dunkin Donuts though.

5909
06:19:57,040 --> 06:19:59,860
It was just so easy to grab like a fucking dunks

5910
06:20:00,500 --> 06:20:03,270
because he knew nobody was going to give a shit.

5911
06:20:03,270 --> 06:20:05,270
It's like oh he's just drinking dunks.

5912
06:20:06,150 --> 06:20:06,709
It sucks.

5913
06:20:07,430 --> 06:20:11,430
But everybody it's good because there's no expectations and it's just delicious.

5914
06:20:12,069 --> 06:20:16,439
It is the it is like such a low expectation.

5915
06:20:17,400 --> 06:20:20,119
Cheap comfort drink I think.

5916
06:20:20,840 --> 06:20:25,799
I'm not even sure there's a Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.

5917
06:20:26,439 --> 06:20:30,279
I don't think I've even looked but I haven't seen them.

5918
06:20:30,919 --> 06:20:40,470
They're not as prevalent as they are in Massachusetts that's for sure.

5919
06:20:41,270 --> 06:20:46,770
But thank you Mr. Sneakman.

5920
06:20:46,770 --> 06:20:48,369
Thank you Divus for the two bucks.

5921
06:20:48,930 --> 06:20:51,000
Divus always coming in with a feud.

5922
06:20:51,000 --> 06:20:52,360
Holla's every stream.

5923
06:20:52,360 --> 06:20:53,000
Thank you Divus.

5924
06:20:54,369 --> 06:20:56,290
Grimoire for the five dollars and five cents.

5925
06:20:56,290 --> 06:20:56,930
Thank you Grimoire.

5926
06:20:57,569 --> 06:21:00,849
Hey Jerma I work at a vet in Vegas and like a year ago

5927
06:21:00,849 --> 06:21:03,650
when you announced your move I dreamed that I saw Otto at work

5928
06:21:04,209 --> 06:21:09,409
and instantly recognized him because I've seen Otto's big adventure one and two dozens of times.

5929
06:21:17,380 --> 06:21:17,860
What?

5930
06:21:17,860 --> 06:21:18,979
Wait we're spamming a link here?

5931
06:21:18,979 --> 06:21:19,459
What's going on?

5932
06:21:20,180 --> 06:21:21,169
This is another.

5933
06:21:26,040 --> 06:21:29,319
I would put this on the stream but I don't I want people to be able to go to bed tonight.

5934
06:21:30,040 --> 06:21:37,040
You know I would really love it if people could like be able to go to sleep tonight.

5935
06:21:41,060 --> 06:21:42,500
I can't even like save this link.

5936
06:21:43,060 --> 06:21:44,819
This link is like unsavable.

5937
06:21:45,459 --> 06:21:47,599
It's a video.

5938
06:21:49,959 --> 06:21:51,479
This is this is an mp4.

5939
06:21:52,200 --> 06:21:54,319
How do I pull an mp what?

5940
06:21:55,119 --> 06:22:05,490
Let's see if I can get this on the screen.

5941
06:22:05,490 --> 06:22:16,689
I apologize to anybody that oh wanted to go to sleep because here is here's a strange video.

5942
06:22:30,770 --> 06:22:33,569
It's over on both monitors now and it's freaking me out.

5943
06:22:33,569 --> 06:22:34,369
I have to take it off.

5944
06:22:38,549 --> 06:22:40,630
That's my transition into the green goblin.

5945
06:22:43,509 --> 06:22:44,150
Holy hell.

5946
06:22:46,599 --> 06:22:47,560
But thank you Grimoire.

5947
06:22:49,599 --> 06:22:51,040
Las local Las Vegas vet.

5948
06:22:55,569 --> 06:22:56,689
Little Otto.

5949
06:22:56,689 --> 06:23:00,630
Hey robot mentality thanks for the five dollars blood for the blood god.

5950
06:23:01,270 --> 06:23:03,639
Thank you for the five dollars.

5951
06:23:03,639 --> 06:23:07,779
I'm something of a goblin myself yeah.

5952
06:23:07,779 --> 06:23:10,819
Hey scar thanks for the one dollar so I'm not sure if I should tell you this

5953
06:23:11,459 --> 06:23:14,740
but this man approached me and said he was a top 1000 streamer or something

5954
06:23:14,740 --> 06:23:16,659
and he threatened to snap my back in half.

5955
06:23:19,860 --> 06:23:24,020
It's just that fucking image of my face and that it's that's it's like this one.

5956
06:23:24,020 --> 06:23:24,819
No it's this one.

5957
06:23:24,819 --> 06:23:25,779
It's this one.

5958
06:23:25,779 --> 06:23:26,740
It's this one.

5959
06:23:26,740 --> 06:23:27,619
It's this one.

5960
06:23:27,619 --> 06:23:28,900
It's not that one it's this one.

5961
06:23:29,540 --> 06:23:33,319
But with like the other guy's face whatever.

5962
06:23:34,529 --> 06:23:35,169
That didn't happen.

5963
06:23:38,560 --> 06:23:41,200
I made the original one and the reverse one.

5964
06:23:41,200 --> 06:23:42,720
This is so fucked up.

5965
06:23:51,759 --> 06:23:53,520
This one doesn't this looks like a different person.

5966
06:23:54,869 --> 06:23:56,869
All the other ones have looked like me

5967
06:23:56,869 --> 06:24:00,310
but it's weird how the bottom of my face doesn't even look like a face.

5968
06:24:01,029 --> 06:24:04,319
This doesn't even look like it could be me.

5969
06:24:05,040 --> 06:24:07,810
This is some weird cousin.

5970
06:24:16,259 --> 06:24:19,220
Thank you scar for your multiple manipulations of photos.

5971
06:24:20,200 --> 06:24:21,080
Thank you.

5972
06:24:21,080 --> 06:24:27,000
We also have Freudian weapon five dollars.

5973
06:24:27,720 --> 06:24:29,560
Thank you Freudian weapon.

5974
06:24:30,119 --> 06:24:31,080
Appreciate the five dollars.

5975
06:24:34,470 --> 06:24:35,110
Code man.

5976
06:24:35,110 --> 06:24:36,389
Thank you code man for the one dollar.

5977
06:24:36,389 --> 06:24:39,029
German looking like Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2.

5978
06:24:39,669 --> 06:24:47,060
Borderlands 2.

5979
06:24:47,060 --> 06:24:48,500
Thank you smarky.

5980
06:24:49,139 --> 06:24:50,659
Thank you smarky for the five dollars.

5981
06:24:50,659 --> 06:24:52,259
German I didn't know you were in a band.

5982
06:25:03,479 --> 06:25:05,159
What is this band?

5983
06:25:09,060 --> 06:25:10,340
What band is this?

5984
06:25:10,340 --> 06:25:21,479
Is that um I don't know what band that is.

5985
06:25:22,119 --> 06:25:24,500
Booger eating stream.

5986
06:25:24,500 --> 06:25:25,299
Why did I read that?

5987
06:25:26,099 --> 06:25:30,020
They did a song on Tony Hawk 2.

5988
06:25:30,020 --> 06:25:30,580
Oh okay.

5989
06:25:32,770 --> 06:25:34,049
Lit bulb thanks for the one dollar.

5990
06:25:34,049 --> 06:25:36,369
Oh I get it because today is the Super Bowl.

5991
06:25:37,250 --> 06:25:38,689
Yeah see there you go.

5992
06:25:38,689 --> 06:25:39,169
You got it.

5993
06:25:39,810 --> 06:25:40,919
You get it see.

5994
06:25:42,599 --> 06:25:47,080
And a Wednesday is not the Super Bowl but we're playing it again.

5995
06:25:47,639 --> 06:25:50,479
This is a four day long Super Bowl routine.

5996
06:25:54,849 --> 06:25:56,689
Thank you creation the cyborg for the one dollar.

5997
06:25:56,689 --> 06:25:58,450
I promise I will get the internet box.

5998
06:25:59,169 --> 06:26:07,779
I have no idea what you're talking about but thank you for the one dollar.

5999
06:26:08,740 --> 06:26:09,939
Timmy Timtan thanks for the one dollar.

6000
06:26:09,939 --> 06:26:11,939
Video games really do make people violent Jeremy.

6001
06:26:11,939 --> 06:26:14,500
You're gonna go run down to the Super Bowl

6002
06:26:15,840 --> 06:26:17,200
and punch no.

6003
06:26:19,299 --> 06:26:21,220
Thank you flank tank for the three dollars.

6004
06:26:21,220 --> 06:26:22,580
Now the Dreamcast is over.

6005
06:26:23,299 --> 06:26:26,979
Ever think you would do Nintendo 64 set of streams?

6006
06:26:28,419 --> 06:26:33,220
Some 90s Nintendo nostalgia if you ever do my vote is for Kirby 64

6007
06:26:33,220 --> 06:26:36,580
excluding the obvious Mario, DK, and Goldeneye.

6008
06:26:39,520 --> 06:26:43,279
Yeah I think all the old consoles should show up eventually

6009
06:26:43,919 --> 06:26:46,479
but I think we really need to take a break from them once they're done

6010
06:26:47,650 --> 06:26:52,130
because there's so many games to play

6011
06:26:52,130 --> 06:26:53,970
and so many things to see on the old consoles

6012
06:26:56,419 --> 06:26:58,819
that I don't want to just all right Dreamcast

6013
06:26:58,819 --> 06:27:01,139
we just played like 15 Dreamcast games.

6014
06:27:01,700 --> 06:27:03,299
Bring on the 64 next week.

6015
06:27:03,860 --> 06:27:06,529
I'd like to do them maybe once every six months to a year.

6016
06:27:08,340 --> 06:27:11,860
So because the last time we did the when we did the big PlayStation 2 and

6017
06:27:15,000 --> 06:27:17,159
PlayStation 3 I mean this is a PS3 game

6018
06:27:17,159 --> 06:27:20,439
but this is obviously this I played this game for six hours today

6019
06:27:22,819 --> 06:27:27,939
but usually once like every six to twelve months or so I like to really

6020
06:27:27,939 --> 06:27:32,180
because it is expensive too you know I think just get emulator

6021
06:27:32,180 --> 06:27:35,700
but I really I'd rather I'd rather play it the way it's intended to be played.

6022
06:27:37,029 --> 06:27:44,310
So you know buying a Dreamcast in 15 games I mean that's it's I think the total bill

6023
06:27:44,869 --> 06:27:48,310
for the Dreamcast stuff was at least like seven or eight hundred dollars for everything

6024
06:27:48,950 --> 06:27:54,360
so you can't really I can't really do those like once a week

6025
06:27:56,849 --> 06:28:01,889
GameCube like the plate I've spent probably thousands of dollars over the last couple years

6026
06:28:01,889 --> 06:28:05,119
on just old console stuff.

6027
06:28:05,119 --> 06:28:09,970
Sega CD those were very expensive just because they're so old and rare.

6028
06:28:09,970 --> 06:28:16,130
That's a lot of bits.

6029
06:28:16,770 --> 06:28:23,360
Do I still have the Sega CD?

6030
06:28:24,159 --> 06:28:24,959
Uh I do.

6031
06:28:25,840 --> 06:28:28,319
I do it's in a box somewhere do I?

6032
06:28:28,959 --> 06:28:33,759
I think it's in like a box somewhere did I get rid of it maybe I did.

6033
06:28:34,479 --> 06:28:38,560
Stop flexing.

6034
06:28:39,119 --> 06:28:44,819
No well I'm just explaining why um on top of I don't want to just have every

6035
06:28:46,520 --> 06:28:49,560
those streams are really fun to do and they're really fun

6036
06:28:49,560 --> 06:28:51,639
but once they're done they're done.

6037
06:28:52,360 --> 06:28:56,240
You know if you do like let's go back and play a bunch of random 64 games

6038
06:28:56,240 --> 06:29:00,979
there we go here it is all right that we I can't really do that again

6039
06:29:00,979 --> 06:29:04,259
you know it's pretty much a one hand a poker.

6040
06:29:06,770 --> 06:29:08,930
Now there are some great games that I maybe want to play through

6041
06:29:08,930 --> 06:29:11,250
but once you play through them that they're it's it they're over.

6042
06:29:13,939 --> 06:29:18,419
Like for instance Dreamcast I can't like go back and do Space Channel 5 part 2

6043
06:29:19,680 --> 06:29:22,959
that it's done it was a three or four hour experience and that's it.

6044
06:29:22,959 --> 06:29:27,299
So I want to like save them for uh times when I know that I want to complete something

6045
06:29:27,299 --> 06:29:34,389
or when I want to do it full week dedicated for N64.

6046
06:29:34,389 --> 06:29:37,509
I kind of did that for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 we did Dreamcast games

6047
06:29:37,509 --> 06:29:47,009
for like three streams in a row or at least three out of the four

6048
06:29:47,009 --> 06:29:49,250
and there are some experiences that I didn't get a hand of

6049
06:29:50,200 --> 06:29:53,479
that I want to do still for some of those old consoles.

6050
06:29:53,479 --> 06:29:58,790
There's still PlayStation 2 games behind me that I never did just kind of ran out of

6051
06:29:58,790 --> 06:30:04,740
time slots to put them in but yes N64 you will definitely see it eventually

6052
06:30:04,740 --> 06:30:12,319
I just can't really tell you when but thank you Flank Tank for the three dollars as well.

6053
06:30:12,319 --> 06:30:15,810
Hey creation the cyborg thanks for the one dollar it's 9.43

6054
06:30:16,689 --> 06:30:23,889
meaning not a lot of time of time for what am I missing something here?

6055
06:30:29,700 --> 06:30:33,060
Thank you Dirty Margaret for the one dollar I really thought you were going to lose to Detroit.

6056
06:30:33,799 --> 06:30:40,959
Jax does it again uh thank you creation the cyborg for the two dollars here

6057
06:30:41,599 --> 06:30:51,240
uh you missed a Sega Dreamcast exclusive uh Star Wars collection on Etsy for 15 dollars

6058
06:30:51,240 --> 06:30:54,759
do not get Halo for the Dreamcast it sucks.

6059
06:30:55,479 --> 06:31:04,369
They did a halo for the Dreamcast they did like a modded halo for Dreamcast

6060
06:31:10,389 --> 06:31:16,709
well uh is it like an is it like a black market Etsy video game modded community?

6061
06:31:17,349 --> 06:31:30,819
Do people make like Dreamcast games still is it is this that's pretty interesting I didn't

6062
06:31:30,819 --> 06:31:38,400
even know that but I think like the old console stuff is probably done uh for Dreamcast at least

6063
06:31:38,400 --> 06:31:45,110
like for a while probably revisit revisited is neither this name sneak I don't know what the

6064
06:31:45,110 --> 06:31:52,159
sneak means um but the last sentence didn't come out correctly the key was in the lock

6065
06:31:52,720 --> 06:31:55,439
but the key wasn't all the way in and I turned it anyways and I couldn't turn the

6066
06:31:55,439 --> 06:32:01,479
door and open the door so the key went back in all the way and I was able to unlock the door

6067
06:32:01,479 --> 06:32:06,740
we're fine uh thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar if you're looking for a recent

6068
06:32:06,740 --> 06:32:12,020
modern blitz type game you should try out the mutant league football it's on steam and switch

6069
06:32:12,020 --> 06:32:24,310
is it like this because if it's like blitz I would definitely give it a try

6070
06:32:25,110 --> 06:32:28,150
now isn't there like a turn-based football game is that what this is

6071
06:32:28,869 --> 06:32:34,880
I know this is a turn-based kind of like x-com football game isn't there

6072
06:32:39,430 --> 06:32:48,689
is that what this is so it's not like kind of madden style with you know passing and running

6073
06:32:48,689 --> 06:32:57,720
with the analog it's more of like a strategy game right no okay so mutant league football

6074
06:32:57,720 --> 06:33:04,799
is different okay so that's blood bowl okay I will definitely check it out because I love

6075
06:33:04,799 --> 06:33:14,740
blitz blood blow is the warhammer one okay yeah that makes sense uh thank you to

6076
06:33:15,459 --> 06:33:23,299
me for the one dollar your drummer started an nhl meme page about three months ago just wanted

6077
06:33:23,299 --> 06:33:26,900
you to know that the success I've had couldn't have come without your inspiration and motivation

6078
06:33:27,459 --> 06:33:31,779
it's already gained nearly 7 000 followers in just a few months and I know it doesn't seem

6079
06:33:31,779 --> 06:33:36,259
like many followers yes that's a lot but it really feels like once in my life I have a

6080

6119
06:38:58,159 --> 06:39:03,330
that field of action and you rolled a d plus six I don't know what's called when you cross

6120
06:39:03,330 --> 06:39:06,290
over somebody you'd like going next to them and they have to attack them or they have to attack

opportunity there you go hopefully you got the attack of opportunity and you you're saved the

6123
06:39:21,840 --> 06:39:27,439
day thank you so much uh bro luck thanks for the five dollars and 15 cents I can't believe

6124
06:39:27,439 --> 06:39:36,979
you admitted this on stream I promise it's not a snort I did purchase seaman and the mic

6125
06:39:37,860 --> 06:39:47,919
I did I I bought seaman and the mic and the mic didn't come in the box so I had to return it

6126
06:39:48,560 --> 06:39:52,930
and I have to even check to make sure that I got like the credit for that because that was

6127
06:39:52,930 --> 06:39:59,029
fucking expensive that was almost a hundred dollars yes you heard me right you cannot buy

6128
06:39:59,830 --> 06:40:07,909
seaman or the mic the mic for the dreamcast is like 80 dollars and it's the only way you can

6129
06:40:07,909 --> 06:40:13,799
play these games on dreamcast that was a hundred fucking dollar purchase it's so rare apparently

6130
06:40:19,240 --> 06:40:24,840
seaman is expensive incredibly for some reason the disc isn't but when they bunt they they get

6131
06:40:24,840 --> 06:40:31,729
you just buy the disc why would you sell just the disc maybe I guess maybe if you

6132
06:40:31,810 --> 06:40:42,229
assume that you just have the microphone nobody has that the game requires a lot of time too I

6133
06:40:42,229 --> 06:40:45,349
figured maybe we could spend a long time on it at least like a few hours on stream

6134
06:40:46,069 --> 06:40:53,909
desperately trying to make a fish friend but we'll have to wait uh always make you always

6135
06:40:53,909 --> 06:41:00,180
check your amazon orders because that was two out of I believe 14 purchases that weren't correct

6136
06:41:00,979 --> 06:41:04,979
they either were missing items yeah they were just missed disc one not in stupid invaders

6137
06:41:06,340 --> 06:41:13,779
and mike not in box clearly explicitly stating mike included I wouldn't have paid that much money

6138
06:41:13,779 --> 06:41:20,389
if it didn't say that unbelievable but uh thank you brawler to the five dollars and only a few
