1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:12,779
Hey, what's happening? How's everybody doing? Getting started a little later than I wanted to.

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,500
I had to take care of something that was a little stressful, but I was taken care of.

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,199
Sorry, I'm about 20 minutes past where I usually would like to start, but we're good.

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,020
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're gonna play Man of Medan. There's in Medan?

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:47,560
Medan? I don't know how to pronounce it. With italics. It's gonna be a co-op nightmare stream.

6
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:58,200
So it's gonna be scary. This game apparently sucks. I just want to get that out of the way.

7
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:08,599
But we're gonna do it in co-op. And I heard that doing it in co-op makes the game exponentially

8
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:20,260
more fun. This is a game on choices, on talking to people, on making decisions as a party of two,

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:30,170
on who stays and who goes. We're gonna need your help on deciding on who that should be.

10
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:40,859
And at the end of the day, we're gonna do whatever the funniest lab out loud YouTuber storyline is.

11
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,109
No, I'm just kidding. The game solo apparently is really, really bad.

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:59,989
The game with a friend is apparently very fun. That's what I've heard. So without further ado,

13
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,829
we're gonna see if Mr. Italics, you guys all know Italics, we're currently squad

14
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:14,099
streaming right now. If you don't know who Italics is, where have you been? Huh? You don't know who

15
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:26,919
that is? You can probably see the stream right now. But let me move this. Can you see this?

16
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,669
I thought this is funny because if you don't know, Italics and I currently live together.

17
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:46,569
And I thought that because we're both on a VPN, that this was our like fake locations. I was like,

18
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:52,729
wow, that's kind of funny. Chinese market, China South Sea. Wow. That's weird how it's routing us.

19
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:59,259
He's like, no, dude, that's like where the game starts. Because it's like multiplayer. I thought

20
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:09,479
it was like, oh, this is where this person's from. I don't know. Chinese market. Like, how do they

21
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,770
know? So we're gonna do a new story. What's gonna start? I think we have to pick characters. Play

22
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,060
this in co-op. No, no, I'm just gonna, Italics is gonna be in the call and he's gonna watch me play.

23
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,419
What do you think we're doing? Why would they show your address? I don't know. I didn't know this

24
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:37,530
took place in China. Yes, my name is Rowdy. My name's been Rowdy for over a year. All right,

25
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:47,419
let's see if we can get Italics in here. Hello. Yes, I am present. Hey, there you are. Hey,

26
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:54,090
everybody. Present and currently accounted for. Yeah, did you push the start button?

27
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,889
Oh, I thought I didn't know you were ready. Are you ready? No, I mean like

28
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:06,780
the start squad button. Oh, I didn't. I thought I did that. Whoa. So wait, now there's a squad.

29
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,860
Yes, that's what happened when you push the start button. What?

30
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:21,129
So now of course, yeah, I got a custom link here for you. Twitch.tv slash squad. What? Oh, dude.

31
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:34,230
All right, are you ready? I'm ready. I want a, I want a let's go Pikachu. All right, there he did

32
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,100
it. Let's go Pikachu. All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, this is important.

33
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,459
What do you have on your screen? Do you have anything on your screen right now or is this,

34
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:50,759
do I get to choose this? You choose. Oh, chat, who the hell am I going to do? Personally,

35
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:58,519
I would pick Bulbasaur. Well, there's not a third one. Joe or Charlie, which one of those sounds more

36
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:07,300
me to you? You're definitely a Charlie. Am I a Charlie? What is chat? Why is everybody in chat

37
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:16,149
saying I'm more of a Joe? Charlie Joe. Charlie's are like, which one's more likely to have facial

38
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:26,120
hair? That's definitely Joe. I mean, that's pretty true. Your name starts with J. You should be the

39
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,730
one with the J and there's an E in there too. Okay. Oh, there's a, there's the same letter.

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,569
Yeah. Another, another, right. The same letter. I just, I picked you. That does know the alphabet.

41
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:41,500
I also know how to count. I know the alphabet too though. So that's why I picked Joe. All right.

42
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,139
Are you ready? I think you're ready, right? Uh, yeah, I'm ready. So we don't know if there's a,

43
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,939
is there like a part where we split up and we have to mute each other in discord? Uh, that is

44
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,620
probably going to happen. We are on each other's team when it's beneficial to us and we're trying

45
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:10,089
to hamper each other. I guess when it is also advantageous. Interesting. Okay. Dude, I'm,

46
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:19,689
I'm ready. I hope so. Cause this is what we're doing. There's not a plan B. You know what?

47
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm not ready actually. If it's this, let's do something else. All right. Which one of those is

48
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:34,170
Joe? Are you Charlie then? That makes you Charlie. I guess I'm Charlie. Whichever person I end up

49
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:46,730
being, I guarantee you that they're both douches. It's too loud. Well, every cut scene is loud.

50
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,370
Does this take place in the forties? I thought that this takes place in China.

51
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,110
Not that that let go. Does this take place in the forties? No, it takes place in China. That's a

52
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:08,139
time period. Yeah. But that China didn't exist back then. They weren't even on the map. In fact,

53
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,079
I think it was Matt Damon who put them on the map. That's the first time I learned of the great wall.

54
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,680
I think this is us. You should read up on it sometime. All right. That's Joe. And then which

55
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,399
one of these is Joe? I think, um, that's Joe. All righty Buster. We better mosey on back to the ship.

56
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:29,300
You're Buster. Whoa. Buster is just the thing you call your friends. Stop the presses. That's me.

57
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,939
Looks like old Charlie Charming's got a little business to attend to. No, that's who's Charlie?

58
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,579
Can I fight? Hey, Charlie's on the left. No, this is Mark. He's on the right.

59
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,920
Why? Why did I find out my future? All right. This is you. No, no, I don't think any of these

60
00:07:50,920 --> 00:08:03,269
people. Yeah, they are. What's in store for me? You are. Is this you? Are you watching me? Yeah,

61
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:09,990
I'm watching you. Are you curious or are you dubious? That's you. This is me. Yeah. I'm

62
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,910
punching stuff. Oh, what? I'm curious. I guess I just want to know what you're punching stuff.

63
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:23,029
Will he, uh, I'm over here just throwing. What? There's a training dummy and I'm fighting training

64
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:28,470
dumb. Oh, I thought you were like punching people. No, it's not. You're like, I'm over here punching

65
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:35,110
things. I'm just like, what? I'm getting my like fortune told. Um, all right. I got to turn subtitles

66
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,629
up, but I don't have an option to hold on. There was a QTE in my game within the first 30 seconds

67
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:54,970
of the game. Start accessibility. Where are my subtitles? Why are these not on? My subtitles

68
00:08:55,049 --> 00:09:06,220
are already on. Okay. Mine are on. Okay. There we go. I'm ready. Okay. I think you have to ready up

69
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,909
too. What? Yeah. Cause I paused the game. Oh, I see. So it's like in smite. Yeah. I get, I get two

70
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:23,100
pauses the whole game. All right. Here we go. Hold on. My QTE is getting more challenging. I mean,

71
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:34,620
this is a, this is a really advanced training dummy. What do I see? Uh,

72
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,429
what do I see? What are you? Hey, hey, I'm trying to look at stuff. I just got an achievement.

73
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,509
I just beat that training dummy. Sure. Better than anybody ever has. You just fucked it all up.

74
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:51,350
I was supposed to look at that and you like grabbed me. You got another quarter on you.

75
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,549
What do I look like? Five dollars in 1940s money, by the way. I'll give it a whirl.

76
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:06,200
Just thought you should know that. Wait, now it's my turn. No, I'm getting my fortune told.

77
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:17,830
Oh, this is hopeful. Will Joe return those two quarters? Wait, what? I'm my, I'm asking the

78
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,350
fortune teller whether you're going to return the 50 cents. I just loaned you. Oh,

79
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:38,600
it's the smash dummy. I thought he said I can't. All right. I'm no more fucking around.

80
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:58,980
Wait, did you miss one? No, I did not. I missed one. Are you playing with mouse and keyboard?

81
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,019
Can I die? What if I die here and Joe's dead? Have a nice day. Why am I playing with mouse

82
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,299
and keyboard? I can play with controller, right? Yeah, you can play with it. That's what I'm doing.

83
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,779
Hey, Chuck, we better get back to the ship. We don't want to get stranded. Come on, man.

84
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,259
Just let me ask another question. We really need to get back. Now you interrupted my fortune,

85
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,519
so I guess we're square. Did you see what was on the red tile? Yeah, but like,

86
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,039
I'm not the fortune teller, so I don't know what those things mean.

87
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:35,879
Yeah, I don't know. The first one was a flower. I can't hear anything. No, this is the loudest

88
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:43,370
segment in any game. Really simulates what it's like to work on one of these cargo ships.

89
00:11:44,330 --> 00:12:00,200
This is so fucking loud. This is way too loud. Oh, did you pause? Guess what? If you alt tab,

90
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,279
the game pauses. Oh, you paused it. All right. Well, you got your pause in.

91
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,850
There's a five second countdown. Yeah, that's so no one has an advantage.

92
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:24,059
All right, so what's in there? You get three guesses what's in there. Drugs, poison. Really?

93
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:30,019
You're going with drugs? Yeah, drugs, poison. Where are we? We're in China.

94
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:40,980
Chinese statue that the American military stole and somehow gets dumped at the bottom of the ocean,

95
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,139
discovered in modern times and curses the people that find it. I can't hear anything.

96
00:12:47,139 --> 00:13:10,019
Who the fuck is that? Oh, I failed the QTE. Oh no. So you get to be passed out. I'm going to jail.

97
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,299
All right. So we're going to have separate stories here then. Oh, okay. Oh shit. I hit. Did you alt

98
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:22,899
tab? I alt tabbed. Hold on. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Wanted to make sure we were clear who did this.

99
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,100
All right. All right. Are you ready? Are you ready to mute each other to go to our separate ways? Or

100
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,389
should we just talk to each other? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to mute. You ready? Yeah. Separate

101
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:43,460
ways. He can't. He can't. He's gone. Well, aren't you just going to watch me because you're knocked

102
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,620
out? Do you have any choices to make while you're unconscious?

103
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,820
Somebody tell him yes, because I can't. I'll alt tab.

104
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,529
Don't spoil it. Yeah, we're not going to spoil each other's game. We're going for it.

105
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:08,259
All right. So I'm in jail and he's. All right. So, God.

106
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:21,379
There's poison. I knew it. I'm going to turn this shit down, but I can't pause the game.

107
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:32,299
All right. I'm going to, I need to, I'm going to lower the volume. So what was in there?

108
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:54,809
Uh, ghost gas? Joe, why would you increase the sedation? Why would you do that? Are they asking

109
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:09,590
the questions? I'm going to, I need to lower the fucking volume here. Tal is Charlie. Yes, I know.

110
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,200
Yes. Can I help you? Tell him I'm lowering the volume. I know. I know. I know. It says I'm

111
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,879
lowering the volume. Are you doing something important? Okay. He'll understand. Now you're

112
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,360
ready. Yes. He'll get it. Okay. Wait, wait. I can, I can also have lowering the game volume.

113
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,200
So I was sorry. I was, I was lowering the alt tabbing would keep me paused. So I'll,

114
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,639
okay. I was lowering the game volume. I suggest you the same thing because it's fucking loud as hell.

115
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:59,139
All right. You good? We're good. We're back. Let's go. All right. So now I got a picture here.

116
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,649
What if I take a wicked long fucking time? Use a bind? I know it's too late though to pop.

117
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:25,059
Come back soon. Will he just eventually come find me? Okay. Is it first aid, uh, bin over here?

118
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:43,879
First aid locker? That was scary. That was fucked up. Is that him? That's not Talos, right? All right.

119
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,629
Get the mouse off the screen before everybody freaks out. Nobody picks up a key like that.

120
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:57,509
All right. Check the fingernails. Are they dirty? All right. They're pretty clean. Actually,

121
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:09,579
that one's dirty. Okay. I got a key. Should I like unmute and be like, Hey, I got a key. Do you need

122
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:30,730
a key? He's got a pen. Should I move them? Uh, I need to move this guy. I, how do I move the,

123
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:44,859
the dentist or whatever this guy is? What the fuck was that? What is, what's this camera angle?

124
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,700
All right. The graphics are actually pretty damn good. I like the, I like the graphics.

125
00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:07,849
I like the camera. It feels so, I feel like something bad is going to happen any second.

126
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:22,549
Is this me? All right. I wonder if, is it Alex in here? Found him. I had enough time to read

127
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:27,509
all the lore. What took you so long? Um, hold on. Just do, do this right now. But if you haven't

128
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:31,269
done it, um, and when I mean do this, I mean you have to help me do this. How do I make a key bind

129
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:39,750
to mute myself in discord? Okay. Walk me through user settings, user settings. Got it. The key

130
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,349
binds under app settings is the fourth app settings. Key binds fourth one down. Got it.

131
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,750
Add key bind top right. Add a key button. Blue button. Got it. Okay. Drop down menu for action.

132
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:55,750
Got it. Mute or deafen and then key bind click and then type the key that you want it to be bound to.

133
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:08,680
Got it. Hello. I have to, I have to press it again. It's not pushed to talk. Toggle mute.

134
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:16,599
It should be working. All right. So did that work? Let's test it. Hello. Hello. We're good. All right.

135
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm ready. Uh huh. You're good. Okay. You did it. That was, that was a fast turnaround. Honestly,

136
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,279
I probably made discord tech support look bad. Probably did. All right. Here we go.

137
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,589
Professional streamer. When did I ever say that? I'm just a fucking guy, man.

138
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:44,150
Oh, right. I found a fucking body. Well, you, somebody just told you that. It's okay.

139
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,859
All right. So here we go. Are we controlling this? I believe we're controlling this. Oh,

140
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,099
come on. Come see the body. There's no punch book. Okay. Sorry. I didn't do that. I did.

141
00:19:54,099 --> 00:20:01,420
I did that. It's like, goddamn it. Another pause.

142
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:07,259
I was pushed. I honestly, I was pushing every button to see if I could punch you before you

143
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:29,029
punch me. I love this. Can you get in like really close? I'm not already like getting closer to the

144
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:50,069
camera. Waiting in an elevator. Oh, QTEs. Press A to keep calm. Press A in time with the heartbeat.

145
00:20:50,069 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, it's a, it's a rhythm game. Okay. Do we, um, does that two or is that the way it is? It's just

146
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:17,059
two. I am manually beating my own heart. I knew you were going to fail. How did I fail? I knew it.

147
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:27,940
What? Look what you've done. That's the first L of L moment of the stream. I, but how did I

148
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:38,519
fail that though? Did I press A again? Maybe I just, I don't know. That was weird. Oh, lol.

149
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:52,839
That was a funny moment. That one's going in a YouTube video. Is that open? I feel like you and

150
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,039
I just woke up from getting our wisdom. Who did that? I didn't do that. I didn't, I didn't do that.

151
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,119
Pause by Talc says in the top left. That wasn't me. I just, I'm the first one that said I didn't do

152
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:10,539
that though. What happens if you push right bumper on the controller? Me? Nothing. That's all I did.

153
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:15,500
I pushed right bumper. That's what I, dude. All right. Well, we're currently walking around in post

154
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:23,130
dentist days. We both just had our wisdom teeth taken out. This is where you freed me. Um,

155
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,809
I'm like, wow. Can you, how can you, can you come back over here?

156
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:36,619
You're stuck over there, aren't you? Do you have your own camera now? Yeah. Do you? Yeah. Oh, okay.

157
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:46,250
Where are you? There's an, oh, there's a note and there's a note and stuff. I read those already.

158
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:53,299
They're meaningless. Are they meaningless? All right. Well, you are direct. You can like relay

159
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:58,920
this info to me later. Did you take whatever? What's the, what about the safe? Uh, it's locked.

160
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,650
All right. Most safes do. All right. So we're going to get the combination. I have no means

161
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:11,769
to open it presently. There was also the body in my room. There was a box behind the body.

162
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:22,339
Just making sure you know that. Um, where did you go? I'm looking at, um, your childhood photos.

163
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,779
Use the key key. What do you mean key key to a safe? It's a dial. What are you talking about?

164
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:36,539
Is it a dial safe or is it a key lock safe? Oh, are we getting secret spoilers? What the

165
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:48,200
fuck are you guys talking about? I found the guy you killed. I didn't kill anybody. I mean, you,

166
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,779
you went to the infirmary. This is the doctor. It's a dial. So I'm just putting two and two together

167
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:57,700
here. Everyone was screaming at me. They put the key in the safe. Have you guys ever seen a safe

168
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:06,579
before? Why would I put a key into the same? Oh, they just scared the shit out of me. I thought,

169
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:13,859
okay, yeah, I thought that was me, but that was you. All right. Who ever designed these things

170
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:19,720
to probably go back to engineering school? I don't, what was down where you were the body?

171
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:26,680
Why does right bumper do that? Maybe right bumper is put on pause. Maybe you have it as like a left

172
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:36,680
click or something from like a bind key or something. Use the key on the door. I did.

173
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:47,769
What door? I think I found something. Why would they give me full motion control of the face?

174
00:24:53,099 --> 00:25:03,619
Is that you making the noise? What the hell? I don't know what I'm what the helling right now.

175
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:07,619
I can't see what my character sees. I see you sneaking up on me though.

176
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:19,140
You said, what the hell? What did you? Yeah. What did you? What the hell? Man. Oh my God. Door.

177
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,309
You guys are a couple of mouth breathers. This looks like poison gas on the ground.

178
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:34,490
What was that? Did you see that? No, there was a kid. You didn't see what you didn't see that.

179
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:39,769
Was there a kid? Holy shit. How did you not see that? This guy was you go. I'll go first.

180
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:46,089
No, you go first. I mean, I want you to be able to see the kid. Take a right. There's a flashing

181
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:49,769
thing at the end of the hall. Yeah. But the kid went to this way. Listen, horror game kids never

182
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:53,849
stick around for more than at least a second at a time. That's true. That's true. They are only on

183
00:25:53,849 --> 00:26:02,539
screen for about a tenth of a second. What is that? Hey, Joe, help. Oh, never mind. We should

184
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:13,269
have gone right. This is main story area. Press the repeatedly on the door. Metallics failed.

185
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:21,029
What do you mean you've failed? Listen, I want to see the kid now. What? He could be over here

186
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:30,650
still. All you had to do is press a. Oh yeah. That's what y'all you had to do to hold your

187
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:38,869
breath when the guy with the gun was walking down the hall. Funny coincidence. Let me try this one.

188
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:45,349
We try to get it here. Hey, Charlie, I'm gonna need your help over here, man. All right. Ready?

189
00:26:50,539 --> 00:27:05,859
Am I dead too? I think we were supposed to scream. No, that wasn't that wasn't scary,

190
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:10,980
though. That could have been just somebody saying like, hey, I guess that would be kind of startling.

191
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:16,869
Well, we have to examine that. No, everybody's dead on the ship now.

192
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,000
Except us, because aren't there like 35 playable characters in this game?

193
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:32,599
That might be the free to play version. Who's the lucky winner? They're turning into a mobile.

194
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:54,119
Wait, something over here. Oh, I need to walk. Every character in this game has died.

195
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:01,660
I'm going down these stairs like my grandfather. This is how my grandfather goes downstairs.

196
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:15,829
All right, I'm down there. Do you think you're gonna come downstairs? I'm trying,

197
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:21,670
but the camera reverses and it made me change the forward backward. You're gonna let me go

198
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,789
downstairs because I just see both of our feet. All right. There's a room over here.

199
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:35,819
Can we go in here? I physically can't see anything. This looks like a no. Is there a door

200
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:45,019
right there? No. This floor is old LB to walk faster. Is that true? It is very true.

201
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,450
So, uh, is it just me or are you getting a real strange feeling right now?

202
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,009
Do I look like a guy who likes to talk about his feelings?

203
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:59,369
Oh, there's like everybody's dead. Tough guy. What do you mean strange feeling?

204
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:06,140
Everyone you've guys have come across are dead. Yeah, we found three bodies so far. Something

205
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,660
weird going on here. You're getting a weird feeling about this. Like three people are dead.

206
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,019
So strange. We're in the military and we see dead people all the time, but this is different.

207
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:30,599
Hold three. I found a, I found a dentist in the, in the cabinet, but you get a weird feeling about

208
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:37,769
something here. There's the kid. There's the kid. There's the kid. You see that kid over there?

209
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:56,730
What kid you're talking about? Oh, so you do. Oh, so I must be the telepathic one. He was over here.

210
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:06,009
You guys get a weird feeling about this. What happened in here? Somebody just really likes

211
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:17,369
mannequins and posing them. Who's got the gun? I think I have the gun. You have the brass knuckles.

212
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:35,529
Wait, where'd you get a knife? Oh, you're going to backstab you.

213
00:30:37,529 --> 00:31:06,710
Oh shit. Are we still together? I think so. Come here. What happened to you? What happened?

214
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,390
What are you like? I'm not doing anything.

215
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:26,250
Are they saying mute? I think we're supposed to be muted. All right. Mute.

216
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:34,920
Wait, what? I didn't want to do that. Holy shit. I didn't want to do that.

217
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,859
Why did I do the pro? I thought it was like, I thought it was going to go over there and like

218
00:31:41,859 --> 00:32:01,210
open the door. What? Hey, anything weird going on? Something weird going on? Yeah, something

219
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:10,940
happened. A Tommy gun wielding man with a man fuchu just, uh, just shot me like a lot. What?

220
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:49,319
Hold on. I, so who do we, what the hell is that? Monster. Oh shit. Why do I have to get the mud

221
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:59,019
bumpers this small? If only I had one that was even 5% bigger. I'm going to do like a scratch.

222
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:26,950
Oh, the misty mountains go. Is that the first chapter? I think that was the tutorial mission.

223
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:33,660
I learned a lot about the nature of companionship and friendship

224
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,619
and who should have a weapon taking point against the monster.

225
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:48,619
Um, well, you see what happened on my screen was you were a little kid

226
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,220
and you shot the kid. I shot at the little kid. Well, no, you weren't a little kid. I didn't know

227
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:00,859
where you were. And the little kid ran away. And then I, I shot at a device that I didn't know I

228
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:06,299
was shooting by the way. I thought I was going to go over and open the door, but I ended up shooting

229
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:16,409
into the thing that. Yeah, that was me. I don't know, but I, I don't know. You killed me though.

230
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,059
So that's one for you. One point for you. One point to Gryffindor.

231
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:32,070
Oh no, this is supposed to be the anthology intro, right? Yeah. We're doing, we're going to kill the

232
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:41,880
other stream of the mouth. He's going to go like, welcome to, uh, castedly tales of death and

233
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:55,429
destruction and decay. Our next story. That's what's going to happen. I'm fucking lost.

234
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,260
All right, but what if the credits just rolled and we were back to main menu?

235
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:13,380
Uh, if the credits just rolled right now, that would be bad because that would mean that

236
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:25,590
we spend that much money. That's true. It's going to open. Here it comes. A man and his wife spend

237
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,590
an evening on their anniversary. Here we go. Yep. And if Madonna's filmed in front of a live studio

238
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:51,820
audio, he's holding that close to his face because he can't see it's BF Bugleberry.

239
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,840
I am the curator, the curator of stories, stories of love and hate, greed and beauty, life and death.

240
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:15,860
Stories such as this one. I'm here to record the story you choose to tell. You see, this tale is

241
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,539
only part written and the choices you make will complete it and determine whether the lives of

242
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:29,139
those with whom you are interfering continue to flourish or whether they are snuffed out.

243
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:32,500
See, I got all a writer's block recently. You're going to have to help me out to write the rest

244
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,780
of my story. Decisions according to our own moral. Am I getting paid for this? And we have to live

245
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,320
with those decisions. Unfinished stories. But you shouldn't fear death. That was just something

246
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,360
Telltale did. Inevitable. It is the tax one pays for having lived and it comes eventually.

247
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh, taxes, taxes. What the fuck, taxes? None of us want for it to come too soon,

248
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:04,179
do we? Sometimes you will be determining a story together, sometimes separately.

249
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:08,659
So make sure you mute. So one of us may not make a complete sense to the other because we all have

250
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:16,179
different perspectives. As in life, the actions you take matter. The choices you don't say it

251
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:23,619
will don't say it. He already did. I'll be a close eye on your progress. It's not my place

252
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,780
to interfere, but I might be persuaded to offer the occasional hint. Here's one for free. There

253
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,300
are pictures in this world that can show you some possible future. It's just a really elaborate

254
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,980
escape room. You can find them and study them. They may just help you to make better decisions.

255
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:51,460
Or should I say decisions that result in outcomes you would prefer? We'll talk again

256
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,579
soon enough. We'll have the opportunity to account for all the actions that you've taken.

257
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:07,539
Do you know where Zoomer haircuts come from? I don't know. Justin Bieber? Have you ever seen

258
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:18,329
Brad Pitt in Fury? No. They have military cuts like that. I thought that was Justin Bieber.

259
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:24,809
Justin Bieber did that, right? No, Bieber had long hair and then he had short hair.

260
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:38,219
But the Bieber is like, I don't get my hair cut. Oh, so me. I have a Bieber. Witty Brad.

261
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:44,059
Okay, you're Brad. Brad's motivated. Wait, are you seeing this? Yeah, I'm seeing this.

262
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:55,340
Got a couple of brews. Motivated Alex. Wait, Brad. Brad's brother. Julia's boyfriend.

263
00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:01,340
Are we both that stupid that we couldn't figure that out together?

264
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:06,139
So, hang on. Does the guy with glasses not have a significant other?

265
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:13,619
The water. Diving. Maybe you can show me how the pros do it. You don't have 20-20 eyesight.

266
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:24,329
You're not a Chad. Encouraging, annoyed. I get to read your mind here. Say nothing.

267
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,219
We get to be like the guardian angels watching over our two people that we're protecting here.

268
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,380
Like you and I eating popcorn. Like, hey, you're his guardian angel. I'm his.

269
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:47,500
What's he gonna say? Oh, easy. Be cool. What? Julia and Conrad are, you know, how do I say it?

270
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,099
Super fucking loaded. So? Don't sweat the little stuff, man. It's not cool. Don't make me regret

271
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:58,059
letting you tag along. Why'd you choose saying nothing? Because I didn't want to fucking start

272
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:14,920
a problem. Tag along? Seriously? I thought I was invited. All right, amigo. Calvary's

273
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,360
almost here. Cool. Sorry I'm a little snappy. I'm just a new medical school would be stressful,

274
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,639
you know? Total shocker. And man, the long distance thing. Julia, it's been rough.

275
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:40,300
It's been like two weeks. Okay. Yep. Right on cue. What? Conrad doesn't think we have enough.

276
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:47,099
What if we both just do silence each time? We don't communicate the entire time.

277
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:55,989
Relationship updated. What's in there? Oh, it's got a seed box. So, uh, can I get your input on

278
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:01,559
something? What's in there? Yeah, what? Just, uh, kind of a big thing I'm trying to make a decision

279
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,000
about. What's in the seed box? I don't know. That was weird. It was a device or something.

280
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,880
Kind of a big life choice, you know? Is there something under the carpet? I don't know what's

281
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:26,039
the right thing to do. Go with your gut. Okay. If it's right, you'll know. We're giving each

282
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:32,679
other advice. Yeah, that's changing our, uh, direction wheels. Julia, reckless. Conrad's

283
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:40,139
sister. Conrad, Julia's brother, relaxed. Foolhardy. I think I recognize that guy.

284
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:51,989
Sorry. Connie, this is Alex. Hey, what's up, man? Conrad. Watch it, sis. Lady killer.

285
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:59,429
I recognize him too. Yeah, that's somebody. Who's that? Is that the dude that plays Iceman in X-Men?

286
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:19,449
Wait, why are you deciding what the- What are you deciding?

287
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,449
I would have gone with minutes, way less needy.

288
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,130
So, first dive, you and me? I imagine you two over there doing the same thing.

289
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:47,460
I get a better view when I'm behind. What? No. Warmer back there too. What? Oh, here come the

290
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:55,219
other characters. Why did you puke? Why did you- Where's the old crust bucket skipper anyhow?

291
00:42:55,219 --> 00:43:00,980
Why did they do like the puke thing? Impatient. Captain of the Duke of Milan. Courageous. Okay.

292
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:16,099
I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but- Awkward. Ready to go? How come I didn't get a

293
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:21,380
beer? Because he asked me- Conrad asked me if I wanted one. Why didn't- Because we're cool now.

294
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:31,480
What do you- What do you got? What are you selling? What the hell is going on? I don't know. You

295
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,460
wouldn't say, hey guys, like sit down. You're going to hurt somebody. That's a lawsuit incoming.

296
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:45,269
All right, who's dead first? You want to just pick one and just like just that's it? Like,

297
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:50,710
okay, let's just pick who cares if we like them or not? Like we're going to try to- I was saying,

298
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,550
let's guess who's going to die first, but you want to like pick someone to kill. I thought that-

299
00:43:56,389 --> 00:44:03,099
You want to go lie down? Yeah. You know, maybe I should. Because I vote for myself.

300
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:15,849
I vote for the guy that fell down. All right. Mute. Over here. That's pretty far out of the way.

301
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:19,690
I'm just thinking about backup targets in case we don't find anything on the dive cam.

302
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:23,690
Listen to me. I've never heard of this wreck you're looking for. Usually these things are

303
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:29,769
crawling with divers. Yeah, this one's different. I'm just saying if it gets too late, I know some

304
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:38,539
nice places where you can just take, you know, a nice dive. A nice dive. Um, Brad did his homework.

305
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:44,139
Who was that? Was that Italian? Okay, look, you're the client. I'm just saying we don't have unlimited

306
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:57,269
daylight. I'm going to go help Conrad and Julia with the camera. What you got? What you got?

307
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,659
Feast your eyes on this. We found a plane. A plane? Brad's calculations were right on the money.

308
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:10,980
Always bet on Brad. Kid's a whiz. We should thank him. You gotta, you gotta keep that person

309
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:16,179
around. We are ready to dive. They waited until they came out here to find- Technically, we should

310
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:22,900
call this in to port authorities as an unreported wreck. Well, technically. Are you sure you don't

311
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:34,010
get any money? Do you want money or not, bro? We could be rich. Wait, are you saying we shouldn't

312
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:44,949
dive? Can't dive? What the fuck? Um, fine, you don't want to dive? Okay, let's not dive then.

313
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:51,110
Guys, look, I think we gotta listen to our experienced- No, I wanted to dive. Oh, I see.

314
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:56,710
I'm sucking up right now. I see. What the hell? Wait, what?

315
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:03,909
What? No, no, no, it's not. I'm just saying she's right, not because she's beautiful.

316
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,869
I mean, she is beautiful, but that's like a coincidence. I feel like I'm watching- She's

317
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:15,110
the captain. Look, we paid for this dive. Generously. We're diving. We're diving. To the client.

318
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:23,670
But if anything goes wrong- I just can't wait to be the first one down there. Can you imagine?

319
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,150
Untouched? First to die. God, I just can't wait to be the first one to go down there and

320
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,269
guarantee the dive. First. I'll set up the tanks. The boys will do the final checks.

321
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,789
Take a look at the camera. See if you can find anything useful. Righto. He looks right over into

322
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:54,539
the lens, like in this camera. He's like, hey guys. I believe we're back. Hey, hey. Hey, sweetie.

323
00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:11,690
I think we're in good shape. It's probably not a bad idea for you to have a clue how these things

324
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:17,449
work. Gotta say, not too happy with our captain at the moment. Did you see that? They see what?

325
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:23,369
Seriously, where does she get off bitching about? What is that? She's making a small fortune on the

326
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:27,130
street. I don't see anything. Yeah, not that small. I don't know if that's like a bug or if it's

327
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,690
supposed to disappear when I look directly at you. All right. I'm going to get these

328
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:46,170
rebreather set up. Why? What are you laughing about? This is just ridiculous. All right. Are

329
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:54,949
you right? And then we'll go through the final steps together. Cool. Just holler at us when

330
00:47:54,949 --> 00:48:00,789
you're ready. Don't pick up the binoculars. She's in the frame. Don't pick up the binoculars.

331
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:05,670
It's a waste. Maybe you'll see something I don't. I don't know. Wait, didn't you say what the heck

332
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:14,360
was that? Yeah, I was like a game glitch. Game glitch or did you see something? That kind of

333
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:49,860
question will get somebody killed. This is out of focus. Oh, what was that? Did you see the thing?

334
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:58,260
No, I'm looking for the sun to look directly at it. It's not here. I didn't see anything.

335
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:14,099
The first impression on the lovely Fliss. Okay, now three, don't call her the she's a person,

336
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:19,059
not a thing. And four, do you ever even think about anything else? Hey, ladies got a thirst

337
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:24,900
and I'm here to quench it. And what's with all the numbers? Oh, yeah, I forgot. Bro's afraid of math

338
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,619
and that's fine. Gotta say trying to like get into your conversation. I saw that.

339
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:39,380
Wait, no, I can't pause on my side. Well, I will never push this button. The next time I push this

340
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:47,019
button, I will uninstall the game. It's RB. RB? Arby's? That sounds good to me.

341
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,579
We paid top dollar to come out here in the middle of nowhere to do whatever he wants

342
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:55,579
without any namby pambies breathing down our neck. Is RB's good? Have you ever had it?

343
00:49:55,579 --> 00:50:01,019
I'm serious, Connie. All right, I'm gonna get these rebreather set up. 29 degrees,

344
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:09,099
they do in Celsius the same, America. Is this? No, this is China. Are we still in China? Are we

345
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:20,760
still supposed to be in China? Do you know how to use that? Not really. Wanna just let it do its

346
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:32,789
thing. I'm just like turning. What? I just got like a QTE when you came over and said slam dunk.

347
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:39,110
Oh, captain, my captain. Slam dunk. You know, we have rules out here for a reason. You guys gotta

348
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,829
respect that. At least you showed me a little respect. I'm stuck in here. Even if you're the

349
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:54,380
only one in the group. One of my options to speak is I like it when you're strict. I didn't catch

350
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,059
that. Hey, I like it when you're strict. Sometimes I just want to be kept in line. You know what I'm

351
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:02,619
saying? I don't mind a little submission now and then. Is there no way for you to turn that off?

352
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:07,500
Turn one off. That thing where you have to hit on me like every two seconds. Somebody wrote this.

353
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,889
I'm just standing next to you. Can I be like, hey, dude, you're a fucking annoying person.

354
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:17,530
So is it working? Do you have brain damage in my upstairs brain or my downstairs brain?

355
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,909
I have to tell you. I can't leave. I'm getting a little concerned about the cavalier nature of

356
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:29,429
this dive. These rules are all pretty basic stuff. I look left and right. How much experience do you

357
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:35,030
have with these kind of dives? Oh, you're in this? Yeah, I stood right next to you.

358
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,469
Why are you in this conversation? I've done a couple of wrecks over the years.

359
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:45,590
So you heard all that. You know, experienced. If this is your first unreported wreck, then you

360
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:51,750
should know there's a very specific protocol you have to follow. For all you know, this could be a

361
00:51:51,750 --> 00:52:03,619
war grave. Disturbing it would be illegal and immoral. How is it immoral? I love just the wheels

362
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:08,340
turning in your head. You know, you're even more intoxicating when you're angry. And I am ready to

363
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:14,019
get wasted. You have literally never spoken to a woman before in your life. Have you? No. Hmm.

364
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:22,360
It shows. No. No. Hey, come play with this thing. It's cool. He's very confident for someone who's

365
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,880
never spoken to a woman before. Wait, something down there? No, there was a computer. Wait,

366
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:45,659
didn't the guy say? Look at the pictures. This is a fake license. I don't know what that was.

367
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:58,789
They misspelled height. Height is misspelled? Yeah, H-I-G-H-T. Really? I didn't pick up on that.

368
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:04,309
What's up? How you doing? Sorry, that bruski got the better of me.

369
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,829
Was there something important on that license that I'm supposed to know?

370
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:13,510
Geez, man. You should know how to handle your liquor. I was trying to- Just try to bond with

371
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:19,190
Conrad, like you said. My guzzling bruise? Come on. Okay, okay. You go hit the high seas.

372
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:28,150
I'll be up when I'm good. Uh-oh. All right. Tanks are ready.

373
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:47,860
All right, tanks are ready. You ready to go for a dive? Hold on. Listen, hold on. Hey. Hello.

374
00:53:48,679 --> 00:54:00,869
Hey. Hey. That was strange. I gotta get my steps in. How are you feeling?

375
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:09,030
Shouldn't have had that beer. Shouldn't have had that beer. Can I talk to you again?

376
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:13,659
You know your brother can't handle his drink. Oh, shut up. Just a little seasick.

377
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:21,340
Yeah, my brother's fine. I'll be up as soon as I- Come and take- Conrad, give me a hand. Okay.

378
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:28,139
Wait, did I just? Yep. I think I just got a yoink. I just yuck you. It takes all that CO2 that you

379
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:33,659
normally just exhale into the water and instead it gets totally reused. Then it reduces decompression

380
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:43,909
time on your way up. State of the art. Okay. O2 check done. Is that a- No, that's a streamer

381
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:53,289
backpack. I mean, TwitchCon is in just 20 days. Thanks for sending me streams. Thanks for sending

382
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:59,820
me straight. Oh, hey guys. What? Jesus. Why are you so loud? I almost completely forgot. When I

383
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,780
was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail. Kabooey. That's your way into the

384
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:10,940
plane. Oh, nice work, man. I actually did see that. You're welcome. Am I going down? I'm gonna go see

385
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,340
what Fliss is up to. You behave, Connie. When you dive, I'm gonna take control of the boat and just

386
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:27,820
leave. Nope. Definitely. Definitely. You're on camera. I'll take the wheel. Let's get a before photo.

387
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:43,400
Selfie stick. Because of the- I thought I was holding the shield. I thought I was holding

388
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:52,250
the shield. You ever have to use one? On a shark? Nope. What the fuck was that? Think about the

389
00:55:52,250 --> 00:56:07,619
implications. All right. Here we go. You ready? I think it's time to mute. Yeah. Hey, good luck.

390
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:28,949
See you later. Or not. Don't you fall backwards in a dive? You go backwards in. Why mute? Because

391
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:34,949
Alex is getting a completely separate story connected to the one I'm doing, too. I think

392
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:45,510
I've seen the same thing you've seen. Oh. Well, eventually. Yeah, eventually. In about 25 seconds.

393
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:57,340
Unless I become the other character. You might. Howdy, captain. You fancy a pint with your second

394
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,860
in command? You are not my second in command. Third in command. No. Fresh and eager cabin boy.

395
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:10,139
Are you that? I'm the shark. I'm controlling it right now. Over a frosty amber liquid.

396
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:21,960
Pass. I have to stay focused on your friends down there. All right. Mute. Pretty nice ride you got

397
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:30,739
here. Where'd you get the cash? Shut up. Leave me alone. You know it's not polite to ask a lady

398
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:36,019
about her money. Fair enough. I was just thinking about buying a bug myself and I thought maybe-

399
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:47,420
At this point, just go sit over there. Sorry. I haven't got enough on my plate for the moment.

400
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:55,110
Rowdy is Fliss. I just freaky fighted you out of your own body and now I'm Alex.

401
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:07,429
It's all good. All right. So here we go. I'm controlling. Was that you or me? I'm on the

402
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:15,110
boat. What? I'm on the boat right now. I'm Fliss. We're not in the same- We're at different video

403
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:22,179
games. Okay. I thought- I thought I was just seeing what you were doing. Oh, no. All right.

404
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:33,400
Let's mute it. Wow. That is not your everyday wreck. I hope those clowns don't get me in trouble.

405
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:52,150
Mattel found a picture. I hope he's okay down there. Wait, binoculars. Nice.

406
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:38,699
Oh, Monka S. Monka S. Hold on. I- I missed it? What do you mean blind?

407
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:52,119
These things are all fucking scratched up and like scuffed up. What are you guys talking about?

408
00:59:52,119 --> 01:00:09,980
Oh. Oh my god. It's a fucking buoy. All right. Let's talk. Can I talk to you? Let me get one

409
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:26,780
of those beers. I want a beer. It is you- I got to do some boat maintenance. Like, let's go.

410
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:42,949
I gotcha. Serious. Enjoy your vacation. Yeah, sure. Enjoy your vacation. Watch me.

411
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:50,389
All right. I gotta go clean like the bathroom or something. All right. To go boat maintenance,

412
01:00:50,389 --> 01:01:01,579
I gotta go like re-oil the engine. Clean the sofa. Go fishing. Change the oil. What does- what

413
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:21,449
happened? What does- what happened to the maintenance? What is this? Okay, that was a gun.

414
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:37,159
That was a gun. Well, he's finding all these secrets. That's not fair. Am I gonna read a book?

415
01:01:41,900 --> 01:02:00,329
Should I hold on to this? All right. Grab the book. Shroud of Innocence. God damn it. That one

416
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:06,409
wasn't me. I- you did that. I know. I pressed right bumper because somebody in- I got- mm-hmm. Yep.

417
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:09,050
What? That's all I needed to hear. That's all- what do you mean that's all you needed to hear?

418
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,530
I just wanted to make sure I'm not the crazy one. That right bumper actually pauses the game for no

419
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,130
discernible reason. One person said hit right bumper and I was like, why? Okay. And I just did

420
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:37,289
it. So I'm an idiot. All right. See. What was in the bag? No, it can't go in the backpack. All right.

421
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:44,139
So what do I need to do? Boat maintenance. I don't know what that means. What's in there?

422
01:02:46,539 --> 01:03:02,519
No, don't go. What do I do here? Can I like change their oxygen levels? Oh, that's- what is that?

423
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:18,070
Clouds? What? There's another boat coming up on our- wait a minute. Give me the binoculars.

424
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:35,369
What? Okay. They're just here now. We have unexpected guests. Okay. Don't- don't talk about

425
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:40,469
the divers. Just relax. Do not mention we have people in the water. No. What do you think they

426
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:49,829
want? Maybe they're fishermen. Maybe that's their buoy. Okay. Be on guard. Be ready for this. I don't

427
01:03:49,829 --> 01:04:11,019
know. Just be on guard. What's that about? That's not the Coast Guard. That is not the Coast Guard.

428
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:26,650
So we're not under arrest. Uh-oh. What's happening? I think I'm going into phase two.

429
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:35,960
Uh-oh. Hey, guy. Hey, get out of here. Get out of here. What do you think you're doing? Oh, shit.

430
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:47,429
Oh, shit. I hope I just didn't like kill italics.

431
01:04:56,699 --> 01:05:00,219
Why did you just- money? Why are you flashing your money?

432
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:06,420
You think it's more like 30. I can do 30. All right. You guys drive a hard bargain,

433
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:17,559
but I'm with you. Here. Let's just throw in the whole pot. Let's go. No.

434
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:33,349
You are an idiot. What? They left, didn't they? That doesn't make you any less of an idiot.

435
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:38,469
That's true. A funny way of saying thank you, Conrad. Hear a piece of work, Conrad.

436
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:42,230
I'm not all work. I'm a little play, too. Are you trying to flirt with me?

437
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:47,670
Is it working? I don't even know what it is. Well, he sucks. When you think of something,

438
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:51,510
I'll just be over here taking in the view, flirting up a storm. Hashtag wink.

439
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,860
They're going to come back. We've got to get out of here.

440
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:07,340
Okay. I think they're on their way back up. And I was getting used to it just being you and me.

441
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,659
We need to light the grill. Oh, oh. Pick me. Pick me. You can call me Grill Capitan.

442
01:06:11,659 --> 01:06:14,699
You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.

443
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:23,369
It's time for food. Watch this be how he does. I didn't have to do anything. He just like...

444
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:27,880
Okay.

445
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:43,940
Are you serious? I thought about it. I thought about it. I thought about it.

446
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:57,739
Yeah, I'm on the boat, too. Yep, that's true. I thought about it.

447
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:07,460
It was so close. I was set. I was a millimeter away from letting the boat just burn.

448
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:12,500
Everything's all right now. Hey, welcome back.

449
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:17,289
You almost killed me again, but this time I was smart.

450
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:21,210
There was a little mishap. A little issue with barbecue.

451
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:24,250
Jesus. Looked like the whole boat was lit up.

452
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,969
I thought the video games were to escape reality. Anyway.

453
01:07:28,489 --> 01:07:33,900
These fishing guys came by and ran into the dive line.

454
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,659
Yeah, these idiots. They were just like, who cares?

455
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:57,210
Did you get ripped up? Did I get ripped up? Did I mess you up?

456
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:58,489
Just fucking perfect.

457
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:06,489
No, but I did pull the flight stick of the plane and it broke the plane in two.

458
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:19,659
Interesting so far. Let's see. Frankly, I hate it.

459
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:22,699
Getting to know these intrepid adventurers then.

460
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:26,619
Alex and his little brother Brad trying to swim with the big fish.

461
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:33,340
Both seem out of their dead. And Julia, the love of Alex's life.

462
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:39,850
If only she felt the same. What about Conrad?

463
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:44,569
A bold fellow, you might say. Or maybe you'd say arrogant.

464
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:51,369
And then there's Captain Fliss. Strong, forthright, stubborn.

465
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:57,930
She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms. So far, at least.

466
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:04,970
Let me reassure you. You can help them to make some decisions they'll value later on.

467
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:10,810
You're doing well. Thanks.

468
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,890
We can't let you lose yet. There's still three hours of gameplay.

469
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:22,489
You're doing very well. You didn't let the boat burn from the barbecue. Good job.

470
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,609
You have the intelligence of at least a nine-year-old.

471
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:31,050
How well preserved was the plane? Brad, it was insane. It was like traveling through time.

472
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,010
No shit.

473
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,609
Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension

474
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:39,449
where the past is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles and sharks.

475
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,729
Sharks?

476
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:41,770
Yeah, well, just one shark.

477
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,680
Wasn't Conrad going to get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?

478
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,960
Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some.

479
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,359
And then he got drunk.

480
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,840
Why don't you go get more beers in the ocean?

481
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,479
And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.

482
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:57,560
And he just kept on drinking and he drank all of it.

483
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,000
I think there were four beers in that case.

484
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,439
That sounds like he had some experience with this kind of phenomenon.

485
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:01,880
Yeah, I've been studying it for years.

486
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,760
I'll go look for him.

487
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,039
Yeah, why don't you get a run to the grocery store and get us some stuff?

488
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,600
I left it below deck if you want to check it out.

489
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,039
OK, now I'm.

490
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:13,880
Oh, wait, what's that?

491
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,720
So what are you seeing?

492
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:18,680
I'm about to grab the camera.

493
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:21,399
Oh, I want to see the cool pictures you took.

494
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,500
Nice.

495
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:29,739
OK.

496
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,789
Pretty cool looking.

497
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:36,069
This is how you took these.

498
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:41,109
This badge.

499
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:42,069
Conwin Island.

500
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:42,869
I was totally right.

501
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,380
All right, what else?

502
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:49,979
Can I put the camera down?

503
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,000
Oh, that's a good one.

504
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,229
Oh, that's scary.

505
01:10:56,229 --> 01:10:57,909
I don't I did you to act.

506
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:07,350
All right, put this down.

507
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:11,300
They only dive 30 meters.

508
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,619
OK, yeah, OK.

509
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,180
But Oculus, let's take another look.

510
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:18,859
Let's take another look.

511
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:21,979
What about this thing?

512
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,659
Didn't mean to ruin your big moment.

513
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:25,260
It's OK, really.

514
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:32,420
Come on, you're supposed to be like the techie.

515
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,420
You can't like open this up

516
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,260
and take the battery out and use it to power some.

517
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:42,899
What's going on down here?

518
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,930
Uh, there's everybody else.

519
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:47,529
I'll go get them.

520
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:49,130
Why don't you just do it here?

521
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:49,689
Who's that?

522
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:53,060
Hey, you see my brother or Fliss?

523
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,859
Uh, no, I got distracted.

524
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:56,819
Let's go get him.

525
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:57,060
Sure.

526
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:05,829
So which one is, uh, you know, where the magic happens?

527
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:09,619
Where is it?

528
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:10,020
It's Alex.

529
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,380
Is he upstairs now?

530
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:19,819
Oh, no, that's not OK.

531
01:12:19,819 --> 01:12:22,140
Hey, we're standing next to each other now.

532
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,020
Conrad, beers.

533
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,579
Where are they?

534
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:24,380
We are, yes.

535
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,579
Oh, yeah, the beers.

536
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,340
I was just getting them now.

537
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:32,409
Nice.

538
01:12:32,409 --> 01:12:33,130
There's four in there.

539
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:35,720
We can all have one each.

540
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:38,739
And that's it for the whole entire trip.

541
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,229
All right.

542
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,670
Now that everybody's here,

543
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,069
let's take a look at the navigator's pad we found.

544
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:52,069
Maybe we can figure out why the plane was out here.

545
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:52,789
Where did you put it?

546
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:53,590
It's in your case.

547
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,470
OK, I'll go get it.

548
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:55,609
Hey.

549
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:00,520
Hey, uh, hey, are you going to say something?

550
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,500
No.

551
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh, no.

552
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,479
Oh, shit.

553
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,199
I think I like this.

554
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:04,920
I think I accent.

555
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,239
All right.

556
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:06,199
I'm just OK.

557
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:09,300
Alex.

558
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,939
Holy crap.

559
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,100
Were you guys like in the plane?

560
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,939
I'm talking about your, uh, your adventure.

561
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:15,220
Got out in the nick of time.

562
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,500
Skin of our teeth.

563
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,739
Well, our skin was almost in a shark's teeth.

564
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:19,239
What?

565
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,180
Uh, yeah.

566
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,020
Didn't I tell you there are sharks around here?

567
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,220
Uh, but you saw a shark.

568
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:23,859
Most of them are.

569
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:24,739
I did see a shark.

570
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:25,779
Yeah, I thought it was you.

571
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,180
It almost got me.

572
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:34,649
So does the accident mean we can't do any more diving?

573
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:36,010
That's a good question.

574
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,930
Let me just say this once more for the record.

575
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:40,890
Going into that plane was super dangerous, obviously,

576
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,569
and twice as illegal.

577
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:43,289
Where are you?

578
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:46,250
Now damage is done, so we just have to lie about it forever.

579
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:48,090
Or else we're going to go to jail.

580
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,130
I'm exploring.

581
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,609
Oh, OK.

582
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:51,449
Well, my lips are sealed.

583
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:55,750
So we're going again tomorrow?

584
01:13:58,659 --> 01:14:00,500
I thought I was going to learn something there.

585
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,819
You should be looking at this, because that's just all of our adventures.

586
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:03,699
We're all going to stay on the boat.

587
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,180
I think it's too dangerous.

588
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,819
I think it's too dangerous to go in the water.

589
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,979
I didn't even get to do anything.

590
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:17,779
Brad are for Brayson Lee.

591
01:14:18,739 --> 01:14:20,020
You got a girlfriend?

592
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:20,579
Barbecue.

593
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:25,670
Are you with me?

594
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:25,989
I do.

595
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:27,270
No, I'm talking to Conrad.

596
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,229
Oh, I mean, I did.

597
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:30,390
Broke up with her, though.

598
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,350
Just too much to handle.

599
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:32,630
Women, right?

600
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,710
Yeah, women.

601
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,229
There's another boat just rolled up.

602
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:36,869
They exist.

603
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:37,590
You're correct.

604
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:40,550
They definitely exist, especially the one you just broke up with.

605
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,989
That one, for sure.

606
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:44,390
Right here.

607
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:44,890
Hey.

608
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,020
Yeah, I know, right?

609
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,819
That's how I feel.

610
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:49,460
What the heck?

611
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,430
We got places to be and things to do.

612
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,470
Here comes the drinks.

613
01:14:55,109 --> 01:14:55,590
Enjoy it.

614
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,510
All right, if you drink, you die, guaranteed.

615
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:01,670
The first person to take the first sip is the person that we kill first.

616
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:02,390
Check it out.

617
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,430
I don't think we'll have to try.

618
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,630
I think they'll just die.

619
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,270
Screenshot that.

620
01:15:05,989 --> 01:15:07,670
Who wants to find some sunken treasure?

621
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:09,989
So what do you think, Adam?

622
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:11,109
Coordinates?

623
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,350
Those are coordinates, all right.

624
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,029
Maybe the plane's destination.

625
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:16,470
You think we could get there by tomorrow?

626
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:18,310
It takes a couple hours if the weather's...

627
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,909
Is this what I found underwater?

628
01:15:19,909 --> 01:15:20,470
I think so.

629
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,430
You find anything else?

630
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:24,789
There was a flight plan on board that seemed to indicate it was a rescue plane.

631
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:26,229
Yeah, that makes sense.

632
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,710
After the war, they turned long-range bombers into rescue planes.

633
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:32,149
And then this plane must have been shot down because it was riddled with bullet holes.

634
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:33,750
I found one lodged in a fuselage.

635
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,149
Huh.

636
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:35,430
And it was full of life rafts.

637
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,229
It must have gotten shot down before they could deliver all the rafts.

638
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:39,430
There was only one missing.

639
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,710
From the photos Alex took, you can see the flight badge on one of the corpses.

640
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,630
That means the crew is from Conwin Island,

641
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,470
smack dab in the middle of the Pacific theater.

642
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:48,390
Called it.

643
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,909
Reckless, all of you.

644
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:50,710
Excuse me?

645
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,109
I told you to leave everything down there alone.

646
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:53,829
Oh, come on.

647
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:55,029
We've been through this already.

648
01:15:55,029 --> 01:15:56,229
I'm not talking about the love.

649
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:02,550
Then what?

650
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:04,890
Superstition?

651
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:05,529
Is that it?

652
01:16:05,529 --> 01:16:05,850
Really?

653
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,340
The dead don't sleep well in these waters.

654
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:09,739
Constant conflict.

655
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:13,579
Makes me feel silly enough to you all, but I was raised on this shit and it sticks.

656
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:20,979
You're right.

657
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:22,420
We should have been more careful.

658
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:23,060
That's not me.

659
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,939
I'm sorry.

660
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:24,500
I'm lying.

661
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:26,500
Okay.

662
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:26,739
Okay.

663
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,100
Maybe.

664
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:28,979
True, but I'm lying.

665
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:29,779
I don't know you.

666
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:30,659
But you're lying.

667
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,539
You should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.

668
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:34,739
It's bad luck.

669
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:37,220
You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference,

670
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,180
but every single thing you bring back has an essence.

671
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,939
It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.

672
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:42,739
Here we go.

673
01:16:42,739 --> 01:16:42,979
Huh.

674
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,140
I never thought about it like that.

675
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,420
You never think about much of anything.

676
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,739
Well, maybe I never heard about such cool ghost stories.

677
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:50,500
They're not cool ghost stories.

678
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,100
Not like for fun.

679
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:56,260
People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.

680
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:56,979
Damn straight.

681
01:16:57,939 --> 01:17:00,100
Fred, you got a fun ghost story, right?

682
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:06,739
Yeah, I heard a story.

683
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,659
Happened right around here too.

684
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:09,300
Let's hear it.

685
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:11,140
We could all use a good show.

686
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,539
I'm turning this character around.

687
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:17,260
Let's hear it.

688
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,939
I bet you can spin a good yarn.

689
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:20,619
It's kind of messed up, actually.

690
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,069
Scare away, little bro.

691
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:25,510
Okay, here goes.

692
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,829
This story is true.

693
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:31,029
It had happened right near here in an old lighthouse.

694
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:32,069
Classic setup.

695
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:34,069
Wait, true story?

696
01:17:34,069 --> 01:17:34,789
Where'd you hear this?

697
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:38,470
Wait, can somebody take a sip out of their fucking beer?

698
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,189
Are you making up the story to go along?

699
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,430
Ah, well, down by the dockside.

700
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,550
Dude, these are empty.

701
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,430
Where'd you get these?

702
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,710
Skin like a leather book.

703
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:48,630
Eye patch, wooden leg, the whole nine yards.

704
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,109
And for a dollar, he told me his secrets.

705
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,869
Okay, here we go.

706
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:57,430
The lighthouse stood atop in a toll.

707
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,350
Isolated from the rest of the world.

708
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,949
A lone beacon in the night.

709
01:18:00,949 --> 01:18:02,149
A sailor's respite.

710
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:06,390
The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves pounding the rocky shore.

711
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,189
One misty morning, he comes upon a woman covered in blood.

712
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:12,789
She's stumbling down the beach.

713
01:18:12,869 --> 01:18:16,069
He hurries to her aid, and she falls into his arms, sobbing.

714
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:19,430
As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.

715
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,029
He doesn't waste any time.

716
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:21,529
Smooth.

717
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:27,779
Let me interject.

718
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:29,140
Key of the one-track mind.

719
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:30,819
The woman answers.

720
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:33,220
That's what you had to do?

721
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,020
That's what I had to do.

722
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,380
Just give a response?

723
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:36,739
Of course.

724
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:39,939
I was doing, it's pretty popular nowadays.

725
01:18:39,939 --> 01:18:41,220
They're alone for years.

726
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,779
You just watch a video, and then you say two things about it,

727
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:45,140
and that's the whole screen.

728
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,260
So they go to the top of the lighthouse, and there,

729
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,739
splayed on the floor, is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.

730
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:53,859
Always an axe.

731
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:55,699
I mean, do people even use axes anymore?

732
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:00,619
Okay, fine.

733
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:02,140
Then it was a meat hook.

734
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,859
They were slashed with a meat hook and hung from the rafters.

735
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:09,689
Wait a minute.

736
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:11,130
Are you changing the murder weapon?

737
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,409
I thought this was a true story.

738
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:13,369
A lot of blood.

739
01:19:13,369 --> 01:19:14,329
A lot of carnage.

740
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:18,010
You can, things get told over generations if you lose a little bit of detail.

741
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:19,529
Who did it?

742
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,029
The woman says, it was my brother.

743
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:32,470
And she turns to the closet and says, he's hiding in there.

744
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,550
Great, blame the brother.

745
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:39,109
So the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet, opens the door,

746
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:42,710
and sure enough, there's a man inside,

747
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,989
but he sliced out his own insides with a meat hook.

748
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:50,229
Horrified, he looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.

749
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:53,029
Closer, closer.

750
01:19:53,909 --> 01:19:57,189
And he sees, it's his own face.

751
01:19:57,989 --> 01:20:00,390
And then it's eyes bulge out and screams.

752
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,189
Nice play, Dex.

753
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:04,229
You're so gross.

754
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:05,270
Ah, that's terrible.

755
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,069
Super twist.

756
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:06,569
Nice.

757
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,310
Nice one, Squire.

758
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:19,930
You let me go in.

759
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:20,729
Thunder.

760
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:21,210
Summoning thunder.

761
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,649
Maybe I'm a cheese there, corn dog.

762
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:26,569
Okay, you've all had your fun.

763
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:28,409
We should all turn in.

764
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:29,770
There's some weather hitting, are we?

765
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,250
Uh-uh.

766
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,890
No, no, no, no, because according to standard vessel regulation,

767
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,289
we're all required one more beer before hitting the hay.

768
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,569
What regular issues are these?

769
01:20:37,289 --> 01:20:42,810
It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.

770
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:43,770
Uh-huh.

771
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,890
Where'd you read that?

772
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:45,369
The internet.

773
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:48,649
Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.

774
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:50,250
I'm just following orders, man.

775
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,529
I'm into this website.

776
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:52,569
And for good, buddy.

777
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:53,289
And I'm out.

778
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:01,149
Yep.

779
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:02,329
Yeah.

780
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:04,810
Well, you really can't add anything.

781
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,170
No, nothing to add to that one.

782
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:13,539
By the way, the ship's gonna sink.

783
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,369
Like, imminently.

784
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:17,869
Yes.

785
01:21:18,649 --> 01:21:20,729
No, I mean, seriously, I saw a photo.

786
01:21:21,289 --> 01:21:21,789
Oh.

787
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:31,430
All right, storm incoming.

788
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:36,069
Is this, like, the Kingdom Hearts characters?

789
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:36,789
Scary guy.

790
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,399
It's Mickey.

791
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:53,550
Oh, God.

792
01:21:53,770 --> 01:22:00,229
Oh, is this, like, is this you?

793
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:02,069
I'm on the bed.

794
01:22:02,789 --> 01:22:05,739
I punched the guy in the face.

795
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:06,239
Oh.

796
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:13,079
So about that boat from earlier.

797
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:14,520
About that.

798
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,039
This they would just know.

799
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,470
Was it the same people?

800
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,590
I don't think so.

801
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:20,149
I can't tell.

802
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:22,149
They're in, like, hoods.

803
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,630
Well, it's raining outside.

804
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:35,689
Uh-oh.

805
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,220
Uh-oh.

806
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:53,779
All right.

807
01:22:53,779 --> 01:22:54,819
What's your decision?

808
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:55,319
Uh.

809
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:58,840
Captain.

810
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,930
You would choose the captain when you're all tied up.

811
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,850
You gotta choose the captain.

812
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,329
The captain, it's gotta, that's the decision maker.

813
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:22,439
Just keep the tape on my mouth.

814
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:26,539
Don't take it off me.

815
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:29,130
Talk.

816
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:30,869
Of course he chooses her.

817
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:31,829
Yeah, the brother and sister.

818
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:35,510
Why wouldn't I choose brother and sister over that guy?

819
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,390
That's like Deadpool in Wolverine Origins.

820
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:40,550
We both can't talk.

821
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,539
We didn't think this through.

822
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:48,899
Neither of us can speak.

823
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:49,300
Hold on.

824
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,340
What's going on?

825
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:50,840
Why?

826
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:52,979
What was that whole scenario?

827
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:56,739
I didn't ungag you and you didn't ungag me.

828
01:23:56,739 --> 01:23:58,020
So we both can't talk.

829
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,020
Is that what we were supposed to be doing?

830
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,260
Yeah.

831
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,460
I got the captain because I...

832
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,340
That's just like we play it.

833
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:21,659
Ow.

834
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:22,680
Oh, it hurts.

835
01:24:32,659 --> 01:24:33,539
Why does that always hurt?

836
01:24:35,609 --> 01:24:36,489
Hey, so...

837
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:38,729
No one's ever had that in a movie taken off and go...

838
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:44,250
The bad news is these are kind of maybe the fishermen I missed off earlier.

839
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,850
Oh, god damn it, comrade.

840
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,409
Great.

841
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:47,210
Just great.

842
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:47,930
And the good news?

843
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:49,850
I recognize them.

844
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:50,810
How was that good news?

845
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:52,569
I thought you were gonna ask the good news first.

846
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:54,090
You're such an idiot, Jesus.

847
01:24:58,119 --> 01:24:59,800
We have to get free right now.

848
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,659
So are you seeing what I'm seeing or are you in a different room?

849
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:05,180
No, you're Alex, right?

850
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:06,640
Yeah.

851
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,659
You're what?

852
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:10,159
Are you...

853
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:11,979
Wait, I'm Alex and...

854
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:15,239
Who are you playing as?

855
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:16,119
Conrad.

856
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:16,619
Yeah.

857
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:31,529
No, I know I'm Conrad.

858
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:33,210
I didn't know if he was controlling anybody in this room.

859
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,890
I didn't know if you were anybody, somebody else.

860
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:47,449
I'll be back for you later.

861
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:49,930
I tried to help.

862
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,250
All right.

863
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:50,970
I tried to help.

864
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:52,329
See you later.

865
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:04,760
You can go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.

866
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,439
You're the little lady.

867
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,329
There's no QTE there.

868
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:15,930
I would have dodged it.

869
01:26:22,899 --> 01:26:24,100
This guy just...

870
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:24,659
Seriously.

871
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,520
Uh, all right, I...

872
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:38,300
I'm gonna try to save this.

873
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,989
Oh, no.

874
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:47,909
Don't do it.

875
01:26:48,949 --> 01:26:55,590
Slow down.

876
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,260
Easy.

877
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,180
Uh...

878
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:02,380
No, he...

879
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,899
When he opens his mouth, bad things happen.

880
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:16,439
Should have kept the tape on my mouth.

881
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:26,159
Kill Conrad.

882
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:28,770
Yep.

883
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:43,529
You would not believe what I just saw.

884
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:45,609
They got fucking...

885
01:27:45,609 --> 01:27:46,569
There's a carnival up there.

886
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:47,210
There's clowns.

887
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,609
There is food and shit.

888
01:27:49,609 --> 01:27:50,649
It's really...

889
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:51,210
It's kind of fun.

890
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:52,170
Really?

891
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:53,289
Did you see what I saw?

892
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:53,789
Yep.

893
01:27:53,789 --> 01:27:54,489
It was pretty interesting.

894
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:56,649
That's, uh...

895
01:27:57,449 --> 01:28:00,649
Considering I was watching half the things that happened through this looking glass.

896
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,520
They're just traveling clowns.

897
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,760
That's good news.

898
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:24,439
All right.

899
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:25,000
Here we go.

900
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:28,189
What's the game plan here?

901
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:34,079
Uh, I don't know.

902
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:35,279
I have no idea what's happening right now.

903
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:36,239
I just was sitting in the room.

904
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:43,960
Oh, that's you.

905
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,520
You're controlling.

906
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,810
We found some scissors while you were gone.

907
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:55,289
Oh, that's good.

908
01:29:02,729 --> 01:29:03,130
So you have...

909
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:04,970
Do you have scissors?

910
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,449
Um, I think I still have scissors.

911
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:08,170
Do you have a weapon?

912
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:12,640
Did you see, like, a man in...

913
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,600
Yeah, that's the guy.

914
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,960
That's the guy telling the story.

915
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,239
That's the guy writing in the book.

916
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:16,880
That's what I thought.

917
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,050
He's watching.

918
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:19,449
He's...

919
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:20,649
So he's a clown too?

920
01:29:20,649 --> 01:29:22,810
Yeah, he's making sure that we make the right decision.

921
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:39,050
How much money they have?

922
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah, they said that to do the full juggling act, it was going to be $1,500.

923
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,119
We need to make sure we can pay for it.

924
01:29:54,079 --> 01:30:05,340
So the next part of this game is a real-time reenactment of what it's like to be

925
01:30:05,899 --> 01:30:08,380
a hostage on a boat for 24 hours.

926
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:11,600
We're just going to sit here and shit our pants.

927
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,319
We came here on a boat.

928
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:13,439
Maybe we can take it.

929
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,270
Yeah. Yeah, it's a speedboat.

930
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,800
The main gun. He's got a gun.

931
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,520
Okay, that's a gun.

932
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,439
We got scissors versus, uh, scissors versus gun.

933
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:24,079
Keep that in mind.

934
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,579
At least one of us can get on their boat.

935
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:30,699
Get some help.

936
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:37,470
If you can distract them, I can get on that boat.

937
01:30:38,109 --> 01:30:40,590
The dude with the gun won't even realize until I'm long gone.

938
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,189
Seven seconds.

939
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:44,109
I can get out through the window.

940
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:45,310
We gotta break these off first.

941
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,109
Too loud.

942
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:46,670
They'll hear it.

943
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:48,430
We're gonna break them during the thunder.

944
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,310
During the thunder.

945
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,810
Good call.

946
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,949
Hey, where's, uh, where's the brother?

947
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:53,390
He can just tell them a scary story.

948
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:54,350
You guys, distract them.

949
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:56,590
Break the window.

950
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,590
Stay focused and get to the boat.

951
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,199
All right, here we go.

952
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,310
Okay, let's do it.

953
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:04,029
Do I have to break it?

954
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:04,750
Do you have to break it?

955
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:06,350
Time it with the lightning.

956
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:06,850
Remember?

957
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,140
Wait, hold on.

958
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:12,939
With the thunder, right?

959
01:31:21,819 --> 01:31:23,979
What? Why would you do that?

960
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,260
Why wouldn't you wait for the next thunder?

961
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,180
You were just saying we had to time it with the thunder.

962
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:29,500
It's gonna happen again.

963
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:43,520
Now we got, oh, is that me?

964
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,640
How are we supposed to stab him?

965
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,640
What? No, this is me.

966
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:50,750
Give me the knife.

967
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:54,000
Get him.

968
01:31:54,939 --> 01:31:55,340
All right.

969
01:31:56,539 --> 01:32:04,029
Buster, it's amateur hour over here.

970
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:06,109
All right, we've got our own hostage.

971
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:07,149
I got this.

972
01:32:07,149 --> 01:32:10,880
Let me handle it.

973
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,380
Okay.

974
01:32:16,859 --> 01:32:17,979
What's going on out here?

975
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:20,300
Wait, do you have one, too?

976
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,600
We both have hostages.

977
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,319
Let's finish this.

978
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:48,039
All right, I'm going for the gun.

979
01:32:48,039 --> 01:32:48,539
Be ready.

980
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:51,600
Oh, that didn't.

981
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,960
What? How could you?

982
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,640
Oh, you still have your hostages, all right?

983
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,600
I still got one hostage.

984
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,800
All right, we still got an ace.

985
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:14,479
Why?

986
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:32,989
Oh, hey, I can't let sister die.

987
01:33:34,029 --> 01:33:34,529
No.

988
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,149
An eye for an eye.

989
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:39,760
What?

990
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:41,979
An eye for an eye.

991
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:42,479
No.

992
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:44,539
What happened?

993
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,300
Who's?

994
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:47,800
We got shot.

995
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:50,479
Who?

996
01:33:50,859 --> 01:33:51,359
What?

997
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:53,819
Why did you let that happen?

998
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:56,380
Why do you go to the gym every day, Alex?

999
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,020
If not for this?

1000
01:33:57,979 --> 01:33:58,479
What?

1001
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:02,560
Bring them downstairs.

1002
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,060
Take this.

1003
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,119
Use it if you have to.

1004
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,189
Hold on.

1005
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:08,689
Wait, did you?

1006
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:12,369
Who is?

1007
01:34:12,369 --> 01:34:13,250
Did somebody get shot?

1008
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,390
Yeah.

1009
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,689
He got shot in the leg.

1010
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:17,189
He's fine.

1011
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,680
No, who got shot?

1012
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,140
Sit.

1013
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:25,680
Upstairs, the girl who's pointing the gun at.

1014
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,000
I can't believe we had two hostages and we didn't get that.

1015
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,199
Julia's dead?

1016
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:31,699
Yeah.

1017
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,399
He's shot her.

1018
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:37,039
Yeah, but then you like shove him out of the way.

1019
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,100
I thought, I thought that's what happened.

1020
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:53,220
Why am I getting blamed for this?

1021
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,539
We had two hostages in control of the situation.

1022
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:56,420
Which one of you is?

1023
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,859
I didn't lose the first hostage.

1024
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:01,470
Why am I getting the blame?

1025
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,710
I did lose the first hostage,

1026
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,829
but I was going for the gun.

1027
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:21,270
What?

1028
01:35:21,329 --> 01:35:21,829
It's okay.

1029
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:23,329
See?

1030
01:35:23,329 --> 01:35:23,649
Hold on.

1031
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:24,289
Wait, wait, wait.

1032
01:35:24,289 --> 01:35:27,010
She's got shot in the face?

1033
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:27,489
What happened?

1034
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:28,609
You guys are overreacting.

1035
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:30,590
We're good.

1036
01:35:31,789 --> 01:35:34,350
This is basically the same thing that would happen if we just let them go.

1037
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:42,579
We would have still been hostages if we let them go.

1038
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:44,260
We're hostages now, so.

1039
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,859
How could we have been so stupid?

1040
01:35:46,819 --> 01:35:47,939
Well, lucky it's not worth.

1041
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:50,420
I could have been killed.

1042
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,500
What were you thinking?

1043
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:55,039
Me?

1044
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:01,149
This isn't just about you, Julia.

1045
01:36:01,149 --> 01:36:03,550
We could have turned it around and we wouldn't be in this mess right now.

1046
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:04,050
All right?

1047
01:36:04,909 --> 01:36:06,189
Shut the fuck up!

1048
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:11,090
I'm not gonna take that from you.

1049
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,609
There is no harm in just talking.

1050
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:13,409
We're just talking.

1051
01:36:14,289 --> 01:36:17,039
The volume down.

1052
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:19,569
All right, can we get two more hostages again?

1053
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,510
I wonder if we can get two hostages.

1054
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:26,850
This time let's go for two hostages and we're gonna play it correct this time.

1055
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:27,649
I like this one.

1056
01:36:28,369 --> 01:36:29,970
Knows when to keep his mouth shut.

1057
01:36:32,449 --> 01:36:32,949
What?

1058
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,560
S, I have a controller in my hand.

1059
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,000
There's no S on my controller.

1060
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:03,170
All right, what do I do here?

1061
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:08,819
Okay.

1062
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:12,239
Well, I gotta see like the secret code to get help.

1063
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,840
Milan requesting weather update.

1064
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:15,939
Over.

1065
01:37:19,899 --> 01:37:22,220
Be like Duke of Milan seeking.

1066
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:22,720
Here we go.

1067
01:37:23,899 --> 01:37:25,180
How bad is the storm?

1068
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:28,779
Hey, uh, just requesting any information about this storm you can give us.

1069
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,579
It's a little bit hairy out here.

1070
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:32,079
Yep.

1071
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:35,220
There's gotta be a code coming in from the east.

1072
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,260
Gotta hit you pretty hard.

1073
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:38,659
It should pass through your coordinates within an hour.

1074
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:41,069
Sound a little stressed, Duke?

1075
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:41,569
Okay.

1076
01:37:41,569 --> 01:37:42,829
Please let me know if you need assistance.

1077
01:37:42,829 --> 01:37:48,779
Not used to a little weather freaking you out.

1078
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:51,579
My uh, my charter's been a little difficult.

1079
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:54,140
Not exactly going as planned.

1080
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,699
We're starting to have some serious problems with...

1081
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:57,199
Hey.

1082
01:37:57,979 --> 01:37:58,939
This is being dipped.

1083
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,020
So obvious.

1084
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:13,069
Do I get to move around up here?

1085
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,630
Oh my god.

1086
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:19,869
He just saved me.

1087
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:23,069
He just fucking rescued me.

1088
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:30,590
You want to talk about like scripted event where she can't die?

1089
01:38:31,149 --> 01:38:34,750
Even the fucking bad guy just reached his hand out and saved my life.

1090
01:38:36,029 --> 01:38:49,680
What is she stabbing?

1091
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:09,380
I gotta help.

1092
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,170
No, I gotta hold.

1093
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,470
Hey.

1094
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:14,050
Alright, this is important.

1095
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,399
Alright, this is important.

1096
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:17,439
We gotta work together here.

1097
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:18,979
Okay.

1098
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,939
Um, we're all in the same room.

1099
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:24,659
I got hit in the face with a frying pan.

1100
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:25,779
What the fuck, Alex?

1101
01:39:25,779 --> 01:39:26,579
Not the time.

1102
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:27,539
Oh, you were gone.

1103
01:39:27,539 --> 01:39:28,899
Good job looking after number one.

1104
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:29,539
In the face.

1105
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:30,340
Real smooth.

1106
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,060
Uh.

1107
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,260
Great leadership, Fliss.

1108
01:39:33,539 --> 01:39:35,539
So Alex isn't feeling too hot right now.

1109
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:36,500
This is so hot.

1110
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,539
Uh, this, yeah, it got louder.

1111
01:39:40,659 --> 01:39:42,109
I turned the game volume down.

1112
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:42,430
I don't trust this guy to drive.

1113
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:43,789
He doesn't have any depth perception.

1114
01:39:46,029 --> 01:39:47,869
It's funny because I trust this guy.

1115
01:39:47,869 --> 01:39:50,029
Because he literally saved my life.

1116
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:53,069
I got, uh, I got scripted.

1117
01:39:53,949 --> 01:40:03,550
Why is it picking up that much momentum?

1118
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:10,079
I told you I didn't trust him to drive.

1119
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:13,199
Everybody would have just planted against their insta-died, by the way.

1120
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:17,020
All of us would have flown into the side of that and all of us.

1121
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,380
Our boat would have capsized immediately.

1122
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,819
Everyone's still alive.

1123
01:40:19,819 --> 01:40:23,380
This could have been different.

1124
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:24,579
We did, we did a good job.

1125
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:32,189
Frustrate.

1126
01:40:32,189 --> 01:40:33,710
He wants more carnage.

1127
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:37,470
Everybody's still alive.

1128
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,779
Kind-hearted creature I am.

1129
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:44,060
I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's to come.

1130
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:45,899
Tempted?

1131
01:40:46,619 --> 01:40:51,260
Uh, should we, should we?

1132
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,140
Say nothing.

1133
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:52,699
Say nothing.

1134
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:53,739
Prefer, um.

1135
01:40:54,699 --> 01:40:56,060
Uh, do we want a tip?

1136
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:57,819
No.

1137
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:58,859
No tips.

1138
01:40:58,859 --> 01:40:59,739
Did I choose or did you?

1139
01:40:59,739 --> 01:41:01,340
Someone can't decide.

1140
01:41:01,579 --> 01:41:03,020
That doesn't bode well.

1141
01:41:03,579 --> 01:41:04,460
I said, say nothing.

1142
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,180
I said, I don't.

1143
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:11,600
Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significant distress,

1144
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:15,279
I presume you're eager to get back to your story.

1145
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:16,399
But here's the thing.

1146
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,439
Everything may not be entirely as it seems.

1147
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:23,279
It's like, yeah, mom, I know I have to do homework.

1148
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:25,359
Like, you just, you came right in the middle of the movie

1149
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:27,760
and like turned on the lights and then started talking.

1150
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:29,680
Mom, I want to watch the movie again.

1151
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,119
You shouldn't have said that.

1152
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,479
Yeah, but like the trash is full.

1153
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:34,159
It's like, all right, fine.

1154
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:34,880
I'll, I'll do it.

1155
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:40,350
And then she goes to the bookcase and pulls out your favorite book

1156
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:42,270
and it's hollowed out with whiskey bottles.

1157
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:46,579
She starts chucking right in front of you.

1158
01:41:50,020 --> 01:42:04,640
All right, here we go.

1159
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,619
So where's, uh, is Tom Hanks in this one?

1160
01:42:16,579 --> 01:42:19,140
So should we try to keep, should we try to keep everybody alive?

1161
01:42:19,779 --> 01:42:21,539
Even the, the bad guys?

1162
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:24,210
Even the bad guys?

1163
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:30,189
At this point, I don't know what it takes to kill anybody.

1164
01:42:30,829 --> 01:42:31,329
Go.

1165
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,770
I really thought somebody was dead in the hospice.

1166
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:39,020
I thought I, yeah, it looked like somebody got shot in the face.

1167
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:53,229
Did they really have to show all of us doing that?

1168
01:42:54,189 --> 01:42:56,430
There was like loading the next game play segment.

1169
01:42:59,569 --> 01:43:00,529
Jesus.

1170
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,579
Nope, no thanks.

1171
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:13,920
So we have friends now because they're not pointing guns at us anymore.

1172
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,409
Apparently, apparently we're just in this together now.

1173
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,920
All right, so we figured out who we are by the, yeah.

1174
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,640
I'm Conrad.

1175
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:31,039
I'm Julian.

1176
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,289
Why are you faster than me?

1177
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:38,579
Just am.

1178
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,729
Flashlight, what is this?

1179
01:43:46,289 --> 01:43:53,090
This looks like signatures from, hey, hey, what the fuck?

1180
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:54,289
That was like information.

1181
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:55,810
Why would you do that?

1182
01:43:56,609 --> 01:43:58,130
They didn't finish writing that lore.

1183
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:01,859
I mean, wouldn't you have wanted to know that?

1184
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,199
Did you think I was going to hit you in the head with a clipboard?

1185
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:11,520
That may have been very, very important information.

1186
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:18,369
All right, this is a really cool like Disney interactive experience ride line.

1187
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,090
With the actors too that are like, keep moving.

1188
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:25,409
Ooh, that was scary.

1189
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,170
Pirates of the Caribbean.

1190
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:27,729
They're right there.

1191
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:28,689
In the modern era.

1192
01:44:28,689 --> 01:44:29,569
I just got yelled at.

1193
01:44:31,329 --> 01:44:32,609
What do we, what was that?

1194
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:34,470
Handcuffs?

1195
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:38,529
Wait, wait, we can't go that way?

1196
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:49,010
Oh, Conrad's from Salem, Massachusetts.

1197
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,000
I dropped my handcuffs.

1198
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,800
I just, I just don't know where you want me to go.

1199
01:45:01,539 --> 01:45:03,140
There might actually be clowns.

1200
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,680
Supermassive loves clowns.

1201
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,600
So, I mean, they, yeah, there might be clowns.

1202
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:26,789
I'm just like AI pathing algorithm.

1203
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:29,239
I'm not even a person.

1204
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:30,760
What are you looking at?

1205
01:45:31,489 --> 01:45:33,329
I was looking at some clothes.

1206
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,529
Some clothes.

1207
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:35,489
What is it?

1208
01:45:35,489 --> 01:45:37,729
Anything, anything there we're looking at?

1209
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:40,710
Just some clothes.

1210
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,590
You already looked at it then.

1211
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,729
Decided I wasn't ready to buy anything yet.

1212
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:47,939
Just browsing.

1213
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:48,420
Leave me alone.

1214
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:03,029
What was that?

1215
01:46:03,029 --> 01:46:04,149
Can I, can we investigate?

1216
01:46:14,359 --> 01:46:14,680
What?

1217
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:16,359
I, I moved to the steps.

1218
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,960
What's going on?

1219
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,159
I'm creating a situation.

1220
01:46:21,159 --> 01:46:22,039
I don't know how.

1221
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:29,359
This is so dumb.

1222
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:29,760
I love it.

1223
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:32,500
Something over here.

1224
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,060
A letter.

1225
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,699
You go that way.

1226
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:34,340
I'll go this way.

1227
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:36,789
This is going to get knocked out of my hand.

1228
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:52,979
Do they know where we are right now?

1229
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,340
There's going to be some knowledge here.

1230
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,699
They know the secret.

1231
01:46:57,699 --> 01:47:00,659
They know what happened and they know what's down here.

1232
01:47:02,659 --> 01:47:06,930
It's pitch black in here.

1233
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:09,090
We should have killed those hostages when we had the chance.

1234
01:47:12,869 --> 01:47:16,239
He's actually going to give us a lamp.

1235
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:18,000
Thanks.

1236
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,760
Now we can really tell ghost stories.

1237
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,119
He's kind of a nice guy actually.

1238
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:24,210
I kind of sweet-talked him on the boat.

1239
01:47:26,369 --> 01:47:27,649
Wait, you had that the whole time?

1240
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:31,649
Why didn't you just put alcohol in your mouth and just like spray it with the lighter into the guy's face?

1241
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:41,479
How is this fucking place?

1242
01:47:47,829 --> 01:47:50,310
Dude, even those meatheads seem spooked.

1243
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,750
You think this ship is the Manchurian gold?

1244
01:47:58,310 --> 01:47:58,630
I do.

1245
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:00,710
We are in the vicinity of those coordinates.

1246
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:05,329
It's still safe to this day.

1247
01:48:05,329 --> 01:48:06,130
We can't just sit around.

1248
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:07,250
We need a plan.

1249
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,050
How did we?

1250
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:09,090
Nobody died, by the way.

1251
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,130
I'm just trying to figure that out.

1252
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:12,369
We're not exactly in the best position to be making any moves.

1253
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:17,619
The second they let their guard down, we've got to take advantage of it and get off the ship.

1254
01:48:17,619 --> 01:48:19,140
There's got to be a big finale.

1255
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,479
Yeah, man.

1256
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:29,119
This whole rust bucket's one tetanus shot from the bottom of the ocean.

1257
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,039
One of the options was, I'm hurt too bad.

1258
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,189
Is Conrad really hurt right now?

1259
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:37,829
Yeah, we've got to stay sharp and keep our eyes out for the right moment.

1260
01:48:37,829 --> 01:48:38,869
Did you do something?

1261
01:48:38,869 --> 01:48:39,109
No.

1262
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:40,069
They spent a distributor cap.

1263
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:42,869
I guess I got punched in the face once or twice.

1264
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,199
Yeah, you got punched in the face like once or twice.

1265
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,119
So, okay, what exactly is a distributor cap?

1266
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:51,079
In layman's terms, please.

1267
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:53,880
Pretend you're talking to someone who doesn't know anything about boats.

1268
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,600
There we are.

1269
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,920
Well, typically, a distributor cap is designed to distribute voltage from the coil to the correct

1270
01:48:58,920 --> 01:48:59,640
rotor, which in turn...

1271
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,000
Glasses guy has to explain it.

1272
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,319
It's an essential part of the engine.

1273
01:49:03,319 --> 01:49:05,399
We're not taking the Duke of Milan anywhere without it.

1274
01:49:06,199 --> 01:49:07,640
It's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.

1275
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,319
Can I see your glasses for a second?

1276
01:49:09,319 --> 01:49:09,720
Yeah, sure.

1277
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:11,560
Can you say that again?

1278
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:12,520
I don't.

1279
01:49:13,479 --> 01:49:15,000
I don't know anything about anything.

1280
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,399
24 British archaeologists have gone missing.

1281
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:48,680
What?

1282
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,039
I picked this up in the bunk room.

1283
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,000
I did?

1284
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:55,600
Sounds like this guy is mad at another guy named

1285
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,239
Patterson for playing sick to get out of guard duty.

1286
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:00,960
Oh, found the way out.

1287
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,720
I guess it's like the third time that happened.

1288
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,680
They really must not have liked it in the cargo hold.

1289
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,789
Go hold?

1290
01:50:08,789 --> 01:50:09,270
What the hell?

1291
01:50:09,909 --> 01:50:11,810
I think Conrad found something.

1292
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,079
I'm going to check it out.

1293
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:13,800
Love dialogue.

1294
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,720
Wait, hold on.

1295
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,239
Oh, what?

1296
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,359
Why did it just...

1297
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:21,510
Because I found something.

1298
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:21,909
Oh.

1299
01:50:21,909 --> 01:50:23,829
More important than whatever you're talking about.

1300
01:50:23,829 --> 01:50:24,390
Apparently.

1301
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:28,869
Do we need both people over there?

1302
01:50:30,069 --> 01:50:33,359
Hold on.

1303
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:34,399
This is creeping me out.

1304
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:35,840
Let me try to...

1305
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:36,560
Are you over here?

1306
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:40,050
I'm looking at glasses.

1307
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,260
And they don't know what to do when you like push A.

1308
01:50:51,619 --> 01:50:54,199
That is a map, I think.

1309
01:50:58,119 --> 01:50:58,680
Got a map.

1310
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:59,640
Come take a look.

1311
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:05,350
I wonder what happened.

1312
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,829
My...

1313
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:06,630
Come take a look.

1314
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:06,869
What?

1315
01:51:08,609 --> 01:51:09,010
Are we trying...

1316
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:09,649
Is this you?

1317
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:11,649
We're like ripping each other out of our cutscenes.

1318
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:17,859
Was that you that I just stepped in front of to look at this?

1319
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:24,470
There's a little dog and the name is...

1320
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:25,270
Chip mascot.

1321
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,989
We don't know the name.

1322
01:51:27,489 --> 01:51:28,449
Private Miller's letter.

1323
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:33,279
We'll be soon and get a job as a mechanic and we can get married and have two children.

1324
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:34,479
We'll be happy together forever.

1325
01:51:35,699 --> 01:51:36,100
Got it?

1326
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,159
All right.

1327
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,640
So who's going to have the stomachache?

1328
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,210
I can't.

1329
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:44,770
I can't.

1330
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:47,250
We gotta go through the vent like a spy.

1331
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,130
I can't get it open.

1332
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:52,770
What's going on in there?

1333
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:54,609
Oh, I'm going to puke.

1334
01:51:55,729 --> 01:51:56,529
This is ridiculous.

1335
01:51:56,529 --> 01:51:58,050
And they open up the door and then we jump them.

1336
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:00,149
Every video.

1337
01:52:00,149 --> 01:52:01,510
And then you actually puke on it.

1338
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:07,439
Everybody shut your pants.

1339
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:07,680
Go.

1340
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:10,479
That's not a bad idea.

1341
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:15,250
I think we just gotta find out.

1342
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,880
Do you want me to just smash through this wall?

1343
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:20,369
What?

1344
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:23,090
All right.

1345
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:23,810
Yeah, let's go.

1346
01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:24,930
Oh, yeah, sure.

1347
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:26,050
Big man on campus.

1348
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,529
Someone should create a distraction.

1349
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:29,489
Here we go.

1350
01:52:29,489 --> 01:52:30,289
This is going to be loud.

1351
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:31,810
My stomach hurts.

1352
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,619
I got shot.

1353
01:52:35,619 --> 01:52:36,659
Yeah, okay.

1354
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:37,220
Conrad.

1355
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,020
I don't feel good.

1356
01:52:38,739 --> 01:52:40,930
Dude, the classic stomachache.

1357
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:41,250
Come on.

1358
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:44,840
All right.

1359
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,640
I'm going for smart.

1360
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:47,380
Well, never mind.

1361
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:47,699
We're going.

1362
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:48,260
Wait.

1363
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:48,500
Yep.

1364
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,399
Come on.

1365
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:51,039
Stomachache.

1366
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,479
Stomach hurts.

1367
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:11,489
That was a little kick.

1368
01:53:13,329 --> 01:53:14,289
Did you do a bigger kick?

1369
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:16,930
You really want the president coming after you guys?

1370
01:53:16,930 --> 01:53:18,050
Because he will.

1371
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,729
Each and every one of you personally.

1372
01:53:19,729 --> 01:53:20,930
This is all improv.

1373
01:53:25,319 --> 01:53:28,239
Hey, do you hear me?

1374
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:29,199
I'm talking to you.

1375
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:30,159
Hello.

1376
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:34,470
They're not even going to attempt, I guess.

1377
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:40,710
They're not even here anymore.

1378
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:41,829
They like went to go get lunch.

1379
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:44,920
Why are we all running?

1380
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,439
Replace it.

1381
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:52,880
Oh, nice move.

1382
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,789
Why would you not replace it?

1383
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:00,710
Because we had to get out of there quick.

1384
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:10,210
Oh, she's about to go off the rails.

1385
01:54:11,569 --> 01:54:15,829
Julia and Conrad.

1386
01:54:15,829 --> 01:54:16,789
Don't barricade.

1387
01:54:16,789 --> 01:54:17,829
Use that as a weapon.

1388
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:20,069
That was huge and heavy.

1389
01:54:20,069 --> 01:54:21,189
I love where they've done the place.

1390
01:54:21,909 --> 01:54:23,189
Come on.

1391
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:25,220
There's only one person with a gun.

1392
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,100
It wasn't that guy.

1393
01:54:26,899 --> 01:54:28,869
Look, they can't shoot all of us.

1394
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,359
Everyone just charge them.

1395
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,229
I thought I was you first.

1396
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:37,119
Oh, shit.

1397
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:39,460
What have I done?

1398
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:40,020
I've done it.

1399
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:42,979
It's been a while since our last pause.

1400
01:54:49,029 --> 01:54:49,430
Action.

1401
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:51,649
You take that way.

1402
01:54:51,649 --> 01:54:52,930
I'm going to take this way.

1403
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:57,060
Let's check in here.

1404
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,390
Just keep moving.

1405
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:04,869
No, I don't want to keep moving.

1406
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:08,550
What if there's like med packs in here?

1407
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:16,180
Oh, fragrant.

1408
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:20,079
Where's reach in and dig around?

1409
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:31,880
Press S.

1410
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,119
I see you.

1411
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:37,880
I was trying to come in

1412
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:40,039
and it wouldn't let me, but I couldn't see you.

1413
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:42,520
I just thought I was getting bounced off the wall.

1414
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,399
You just did the,

1415
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:46,199
I'm a guaranteed player controlled character.

1416
01:55:48,199 --> 01:55:49,640
That's like the second time they've done that.

1417
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,260
What did you get?

1418
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,539
Like rats?

1419
01:55:53,539 --> 01:55:54,100
Yeah.

1420
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:55,619
Or bats?

1421
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:56,579
I got rats.

1422
01:55:57,380 --> 01:56:10,020
All right.

1423
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,899
Well, nothing in here.

1424
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:17,750
There's no sense of urgency right now.

1425
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:18,069
Yeah.

1426
01:56:18,069 --> 01:56:19,909
Well, the thing is like all the other characters,

1427
01:56:19,909 --> 01:56:21,750
the NPCs are just standing awkwardly

1428
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:22,710
in the middle of the hallway.

1429
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:27,300
I feel like I'm playing Spy Party.

1430
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,140
Dozens of people on board.

1431
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:30,340
That's why I was saying that guy.

1432
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:31,300
I would have absolutely,

1433
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:32,260
I would have sniped you right there

1434
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:34,100
because there was no way you were an AI.

1435
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:36,979
I mean, yeah, there's no way you were actually like,

1436
01:56:36,979 --> 01:56:38,100
you were definitely player controlled.

1437
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:40,850
All right.

1438
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:42,130
Well, this seems important.

1439
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:42,689
What did he say?

1440
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:46,600
I don't know.

1441
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,319
Probably doesn't matter.

1442
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:50,689
What was that?

1443
01:56:50,689 --> 01:56:51,170
What's that?

1444
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:54,689
I just knocked the board off the wall,

1445
01:56:54,689 --> 01:56:55,569
but I didn't do that.

1446
01:56:55,569 --> 01:56:56,210
It just fell.

1447
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:58,680
The ghost.

1448
01:56:58,680 --> 01:56:59,479
I can't go in there.

1449
01:57:00,039 --> 01:57:03,220
I got a little rat scare.

1450
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:08,710
I didn't touch anything.

1451
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,640
Are you in this room too?

1452
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,439
Are you in the bathroom?

1453
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:13,680
No.

1454
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:15,649
I gotta go for now.

1455
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:16,930
There's some commotion outside.

1456
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:19,170
That usually means I'm about to be real busy for a while.

1457
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:19,890
Right again soon.

1458
01:57:20,449 --> 01:57:23,010
There's a little boy on board and it sounds like Ted.

1459
01:57:23,729 --> 01:57:24,689
Oh, I am in the bathroom.

1460
01:57:25,329 --> 01:57:25,729
Mess with me.

1461
01:57:25,729 --> 01:57:27,329
There ain't no way we got to stow away.

1462
01:57:27,329 --> 01:57:27,649
All right.

1463
01:57:27,649 --> 01:57:29,170
You keep looking in the bathroom.

1464
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:30,930
You keep finding secrets.

1465
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:38,149
I haven't found any of these creepy NPCs.

1466
01:57:39,029 --> 01:57:39,270
What?

1467
01:57:41,939 --> 01:57:44,180
The captain is always like two steps in front of me,

1468
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:45,220
just waiting for me.

1469
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:45,859
That wasn't you?

1470
01:57:46,739 --> 01:57:49,119
That was not you.

1471
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:50,079
I thought that was your shadow.

1472
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,319
Oh, I see.

1473
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:54,960
I saw that.

1474
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,220
I'm trying to get to it.

1475
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:58,420
These are like tank controls.

1476
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:05,279
We have split up to a point where I don't even know where.

1477
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:06,239
Oh, there you are.

1478
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:07,039
There you are.

1479
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:09,279
This place is fucking massive.

1480
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:10,479
Is it super massive?

1481
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:12,159
Good luck leaving.

1482
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,079
Wait, how did you?

1483
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:14,319
What?

1484
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:15,840
Good luck leaving.

1485
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:30,520
The something scary just happened music play,

1486
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,720
but I didn't see anything.

1487
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,000
I saw the guy.

1488
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:34,439
The guy?

1489
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,239
Yeah.

1490
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:36,039
You aren't seeing like...

1491
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:37,880
I ain't seeing nothing, man.

1492
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,560
I read like one document.

1493
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:41,079
Are you going to like hide in a closet

1494
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:43,000
and am I going to like shoot you again?

1495
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,439
Hope not.

1496
01:58:45,319 --> 01:58:47,600
I shouldn't have hid.

1497
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,960
I should have just stayed out in the open.

1498
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:51,510
How do you read books?

1499
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,590
I'm waiting for you to open it so I can read over your shoulder.

1500
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:55,430
It won't open.

1501
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:56,550
That's actually what's happening.

1502
01:58:57,350 --> 01:59:03,140
There's structural problems with the ship.

1503
01:59:03,939 --> 01:59:06,579
Some electronic equipment is malfunctioning.

1504
01:59:07,859 --> 01:59:09,460
I saw a clown down the hallway.

1505
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,380
Clean the floor.

1506
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,739
Added lead to the soldiers.

1507
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,020
Spell book.

1508
01:59:15,489 --> 01:59:16,369
Very informative.

1509
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:23,670
Hey, I found something over here.

1510
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:33,399
What is that?

1511
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:34,689
A tooth?

1512
01:59:35,329 --> 01:59:37,939
All right, I found a dinosaur tooth.

1513
01:59:39,409 --> 01:59:41,329
Okay, now I got to find something cool.

1514
01:59:44,739 --> 01:59:45,699
No, it's dinosaur head.

1515
01:59:50,979 --> 01:59:51,699
Check out that dinosaur.

1516
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:52,579
That's a dinosaur head.

1517
01:59:55,619 --> 01:59:56,899
I only find books.

1518
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:03,039
One of them's got to have whiskey in it.

1519
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:04,640
Uh-oh, there's a painting here.

1520
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:06,850
Oh, this one's long.

1521
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:10,550
Why is there a flashlight?

1522
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:11,989
My book.

1523
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:13,590
I don't even know who that was.

1524
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:16,149
It's got multiple pages.

1525
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:17,189
I don't have time for this.

1526
02:00:18,069 --> 02:00:23,319
Do you want me to tell you a story?

1527
02:00:24,039 --> 02:00:24,359
Sure.

1528
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,960
No, you don't want to hear it.

1529
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:38,119
All right, why was it just completely silent that whole time?

1530
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:38,920
That was weird.

1531
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,760
Nobody said a word.

1532
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:42,680
Like none of our party?

1533
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:43,720
They were just kind of walking?

1534
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,159
Everyone was just walking with their mouth closed.

1535
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,119
It's because they don't want the other bad guys to hear.

1536
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:50,279
Well, I guess I won't read the rest of that book.

1537
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,960
Did I get left behind?

1538
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,479
I don't know, did you?

1539
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:07,239
This is very difficult to multi-box.

1540
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:20,800
Hey, let's just put like four pages per book in everything you find,

1541
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,239
but you don't even have time to read it.

1542
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,520
What is that thing?

1543
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,560
What's with the sand castle builder?

1544
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,119
The like bucket.

1545
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:27,600
I don't understand.

1546
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,560
What is that for?

1547
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,279
Is it like the engine, the battery, the boat?

1548
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:32,560
It's a Burger King crown.

1549
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,229
Look, it's the distributor cap from the Duke.

1550
02:01:36,229 --> 02:01:38,149
Oh, the distributor cap.

1551
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:39,510
Yeah, I'm sure.

1552
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:50,600
All right, I think it's time for this guy to get read.

1553
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:51,159
You know what I mean?

1554
02:01:52,039 --> 02:01:54,399
I thought we were sparing everyone in the whole game.

1555
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:55,520
I'm going to go get it.

1556
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:02,819
Wow, really?

1557
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:04,979
You're going to fall for that?

1558
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,789
See ya.

1559
02:02:11,079 --> 02:02:11,560
Oh, no.

1560
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:14,739
Is she going to get read?

1561
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,500
Just get it.

1562
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:26,520
Did you make us do this?

1563
02:02:27,079 --> 02:02:29,680
Yes, just all of us go.

1564
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:34,100
You know which upper body strength that takes?

1565
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:37,270
Holy crap.

1566
02:02:40,979 --> 02:02:43,220
All right, you and I are going to have to read this guy.

1567
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:45,380
Are you up or down?

1568
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:46,850
I'm up.

1569
02:02:47,409 --> 02:02:50,680
Don't drop that.

1570
02:02:52,579 --> 02:02:54,899
Throw it strategically to distract them.

1571
02:02:54,899 --> 02:02:55,939
I'm trying to warn them.

1572
02:02:56,579 --> 02:03:03,920
Okay, if you have the opportunity to read this guy, do it.

1573
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,079
I physically don't know who I'm supposed to be

1574
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:09,119
because I haven't made a decision in 10 minutes.

1575
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,279
Here we go.

1576
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:20,130
What?

1577
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:23,569
What?

1578
02:03:23,569 --> 02:03:24,609
What is going on?

1579
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:27,329
He doesn't have a weapon.

1580
02:03:27,329 --> 02:03:29,250
That's the famous one-handed chokehold.

1581
02:03:30,439 --> 02:03:31,560
He doesn't have a weapon.

1582
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:33,970
He's got a flashlight.

1583
02:03:33,970 --> 02:03:34,289
So?

1584
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,000
And he's been drinking Gatorade.

1585
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:40,119
Wait.

1586
02:03:43,479 --> 02:03:44,199
What the fuck?

1587
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:58,399
What if we just all get caught, get put back in the same room

1588
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:00,319
and escape the same way and have to do all this again?

1589
02:04:01,319 --> 02:04:02,039
I didn't do that.

1590
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:07,090
Rowdy is deciding.

1591
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:07,569
This is...

1592
02:04:07,569 --> 02:04:09,170
I like the way we game this game.

1593
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:18,260
Oh, shit.

1594
02:04:18,899 --> 02:04:19,220
No.

1595
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,100
It rolled right into him.

1596
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:22,579
I see you.

1597
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:24,020
Come on.

1598
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:24,979
I just led.

1599
02:04:27,829 --> 02:04:28,149
Wow.

1600
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:30,149
Hey, at least I got him.

1601
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:33,750
Let the record show that I'm not responsible for anything that has happened.

1602
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:35,350
At least I fucking chipped a tooth.

1603
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:36,229
That's all I care.

1604
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:48,710
Did we actually get put back in the room?

1605
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:51,880
I think I'm on my own.

1606
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:55,319
So, see you on the other side.

1607
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,520
See you later.

1608
02:04:57,699 --> 02:04:58,100
Good luck.

1609
02:04:58,739 --> 02:04:59,779
Where are you taking me?

1610
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:09,779
So, he's Alex.

1611
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,760
What if I got too close and he did that to me from this way too?

1612
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:25,399
Get back there.

1613
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,399
Be ready.

1614
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,239
Take him out.

1615
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:46,720
Oh, no.

1616
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,890
I'm going to be ready to take him out.

1617
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:55,670
You picked the guy with the gun this time.

1618
02:05:56,869 --> 02:06:02,850
Guy before had a flashlight and you just like rolled backwards

1619
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:04,289
while he grabbed you by the neck.

1620
02:06:04,289 --> 02:06:06,369
How are we going to take the guy out with the fucking gun?

1621
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:22,340
I don't even think this guy knows where he's bringing us.

1622
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:26,159
Right now, inside of his head, he's going like, oh, fuck.

1623
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,239
I actually have no idea where this is.

1624
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:30,399
I think it's over here.

1625
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:31,840
All right, come out.

1626
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:40,899
Damn it.

1627
02:06:40,899 --> 02:06:45,840
A hat on a stick.

1628
02:06:50,449 --> 02:06:52,130
These fucking places cursed.

1629
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:54,359
Now you tell us.

1630
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,170
Can I put the hat on?

1631
02:06:59,729 --> 02:07:07,920
Look at this.

1632
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,430
Madam.

1633
02:07:12,529 --> 02:07:13,569
Bearing updated.

1634
02:07:23,590 --> 02:07:24,470
Donald Duck hat.

1635
02:07:28,659 --> 02:07:29,699
Holy shit.

1636
02:07:30,579 --> 02:07:36,529
Can I walk him into that?

1637
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:38,449
Will he get steamed in the face?

1638
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:41,399
Have we been here before?

1639
02:07:42,199 --> 02:07:44,399
I don't know.

1640
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:49,140
Christ.

1641
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:50,020
Oh, Christ.

1642
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:51,220
That guy.

1643
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,279
That guy's probably still right here with us.

1644
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:57,170
I mean, you die on a ship.

1645
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:58,210
Your ghost stays on the ship.

1646
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:03,520
You have no idea what you're talking about.

1647
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,640
That guy's still here.

1648
02:08:05,439 --> 02:08:07,439
Well, that was like 70.

1649
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:08,640
That was like 80 years ago.

1650
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:12,289
I think that guy probably walked around for a little while.

1651
02:08:12,289 --> 02:08:13,810
Maybe like a decade.

1652
02:08:14,449 --> 02:08:16,850
And then was probably just like, I'm kind of done with the boat.

1653
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:18,130
And just like got in the ocean.

1654
02:08:18,689 --> 02:08:20,289
And just started swimming.

1655
02:08:20,289 --> 02:08:21,010
Ghost swimming.

1656
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:22,689
And is probably on land somewhere now.

1657
02:08:22,689 --> 02:08:24,930
It's been like 20, 30, 40 years of that probably.

1658
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:25,810
Nothing I've ever seen.

1659
02:08:26,529 --> 02:08:27,970
I would do that if I was a ghost.

1660
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,649
I don't know what the fuck this is all about.

1661
02:08:29,649 --> 02:08:31,569
But we got to keep moving and find Olsen.

1662
02:08:31,569 --> 02:08:32,930
Why would I stick around in the same place?

1663
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:40,899
Olsen?

1664
02:08:40,899 --> 02:08:42,020
To hunt.

1665
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,220
Fuck that.

1666
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:45,520
I want to see the ghost world.

1667
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,479
I don't, wait, I'm going to stay inside of the closet here

1668
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:51,520
and scare the next 200 people that live in this house.

1669
02:08:52,239 --> 02:08:52,739
No.

1670
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:55,000
I'm going to see the fucking whole ghost world.

1671
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,520
I'm not going to stay there.

1672
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:59,340
That doesn't sound like fun.

1673
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:12,069
Uh-oh.

1674
02:09:12,069 --> 02:09:12,470
Painting.

1675
02:09:14,329 --> 02:09:14,569
What?

1676
02:09:14,569 --> 02:09:16,010
Wait, you want, look, you want, Luke?

1677
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:17,369
I got to look at this painting, man.

1678
02:09:17,369 --> 02:09:21,529
Like, I'm not even allowed to look at a painting.

1679
02:09:23,659 --> 02:09:25,180
Oh, this place is cursed.

1680
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:25,899
It's so scary.

1681
02:09:25,899 --> 02:09:26,619
It's a cursed place.

1682
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:27,819
Don't look at that fucking painting.

1683
02:09:29,609 --> 02:09:32,649
You're allowed to have like an outwards monologue for everything here, but not us.

1684
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:54,359
Oh, here comes incoming re.

1685
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:09,590
Okay.

1686
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:10,310
Jesus, man.

1687
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:11,430
It's just a door.

1688
02:10:13,739 --> 02:10:15,659
It's just a steel wall, man.

1689
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:35,210
Where's the gun?

1690
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:36,090
I want the gun.

1691
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:49,189
All right, so there's evil, evil magician, evil wizard.

1692
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:51,689
All right.

1693
02:10:51,689 --> 02:10:52,869
Where's the gun?

1694
02:10:53,430 --> 02:11:02,500
Where's the gun?

1695
02:11:14,949 --> 02:11:20,859
I don't know why.

1696
02:11:20,859 --> 02:11:21,659
You pick up the flashlight.

1697
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,050
Are you serious?

1698
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:31,829
Page 39.

1699
02:11:31,829 --> 02:11:35,140
Warlock streamer 33.

1700
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:36,970
Come on, get it right.

1701
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:44,619
That can't be a good sign.

1702
02:11:44,619 --> 02:11:45,420
So we now have to...

1703
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:48,220
Oh, I didn't even give it a chance.

1704
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:56,699
Laughing?

1705
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:09,130
I don't know, it's been a long time.

1706
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:12,779
Is this going to be Joe or Charlie or...

1707
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:18,710
Charles T. Perez from Boston.

1708
02:12:20,869 --> 02:12:21,670
All right.

1709
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:22,550
This is Charlie.

1710
02:12:27,590 --> 02:12:28,149
Anything else?

1711
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:37,029
Okay.

1712
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:40,220
Oh, fuck.

1713
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:45,430
Yeah, that's fucking Charlie.

1714
02:12:57,619 --> 02:12:57,939
Oh, no.

1715
02:12:57,939 --> 02:12:59,140
Now I'm actually alone.

1716
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:01,340
Now I'm really alone.

1717
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:04,470
Hello?

1718
02:13:05,189 --> 02:13:05,510
You can't...

1719
02:13:08,729 --> 02:13:11,210
No, I don't want to be actually alone.

1720
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:15,560
What the fuck?

1721
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:21,079
Is Brad dead?

1722
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:23,100
That means Brad's dead.

1723
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:42,600
Quickly.

1724
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:46,659
Get the tooth.

1725
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:52,100
Shit.

1726
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:53,850
My phone's ringing.

1727
02:14:05,529 --> 02:14:05,930
Hello?

1728
02:14:08,819 --> 02:14:09,220
Uh-oh.

1729
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:11,619
Oh, wait, what?

1730
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:14,140
What do I do about this?

1731
02:14:24,359 --> 02:14:24,760
Is it...

1732
02:14:25,859 --> 02:14:26,180
What?

1733
02:14:26,739 --> 02:14:28,619
I can get out.

1734
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:29,260
I can get out of this.

1735
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:29,899
I can get out of this.

1736
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:33,000
I'm gonna be fine.

1737
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:33,800
I can get out of this.

1738
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,640
Where was he?

1739
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:41,079
Where were you?

1740
02:14:43,369 --> 02:14:44,010
Uh, safe...

1741
02:14:46,819 --> 02:14:47,539
Do I run?

1742
02:14:47,539 --> 02:14:48,100
Save Brad.

1743
02:14:48,739 --> 02:14:49,590
Save Brad.

1744
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:56,979
Is that made up?

1745
02:15:04,439 --> 02:15:11,130
Was it just...

1746
02:15:11,130 --> 02:15:11,770
That was fake?

1747
02:15:20,649 --> 02:15:22,329
He was just telling another scary story.

1748
02:15:22,329 --> 02:15:22,649
What?

1749
02:15:22,649 --> 02:15:23,609
I don't understand what just happened.

1750
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:28,789
So he died.

1751
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:30,520
Or is he?

1752
02:15:31,239 --> 02:15:32,439
Because he was a ghost before.

1753
02:15:32,439 --> 02:15:33,079
But then he wasn't.

1754
02:15:33,079 --> 02:15:33,720
And then he was.

1755
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:43,859
On here.

1756
02:15:43,859 --> 02:15:44,340
Free blood.

1757
02:15:45,829 --> 02:15:46,869
Nice, okay.

1758
02:15:46,869 --> 02:15:47,270
How do I...

1759
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:47,909
How do I drink it?

1760
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:52,819
I get like a cup or something?

1761
02:15:52,819 --> 02:15:53,060
That's...

1762
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:54,899
That's pretty good.

1763
02:15:56,729 --> 02:15:56,970
Nice.

1764
02:15:57,609 --> 02:15:58,010
I'll have to...

1765
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:58,569
I'll remember that.

1766
02:15:59,289 --> 02:16:01,939
Probably get some like health back or something.

1767
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:06,220
Wait, I'm gonna play piano.

1768
02:16:17,939 --> 02:16:18,739
Open door in the back.

1769
02:16:18,739 --> 02:16:19,699
But wait, there's a...

1770
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:20,819
Snacks?

1771
02:16:21,619 --> 02:16:26,569
What is this?

1772
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:30,619
It's a book.

1773
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:33,639
It's got all kinds of symbols on it.

1774
02:16:33,639 --> 02:16:34,120
It's a...

1775
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,079
It's a Satan book.

1776
02:16:35,719 --> 02:16:36,680
That's a Satan book.

1777
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,000
Okay.

1778
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:38,729
Yeah.

1779
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:47,420
All should silently assemble in no more or fewer than five true individuals of sound,

1780
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:48,379
mind, and spirit.

1781
02:16:48,379 --> 02:16:52,299
It should number three female and two male, firstborn, faces obscured with blood.

1782
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:58,059
Know it is important to the sorcerer and the spiritual well-being flock

1783
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:04,700
that before the festival of Akra Mahamarai Ken,

1784
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:11,739
ritual of Threskeia is performed to went away demons by means of Kabal.

1785
02:17:14,069 --> 02:17:19,030
The pentacle shall be drawn and each member shall stand at each of the five primary points.

1786
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:21,590
A lady born of the sea shall be rendered unconscious

1787
02:17:21,590 --> 02:17:23,110
and placed at the center of the pentacle.

1788
02:17:23,670 --> 02:17:27,510
It is from there that the assembled should recite the incantation of a Sorus

1789
02:17:28,549 --> 02:17:33,110
sword in hand with all exhaustion possible as is written,

1790
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:36,709
we five stand at the furthest point where yet close enough to touch.

1791
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:40,950
The five starred, great power turning 90 degrees to yore

1792
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:43,510
to describe the unicursal out.

1793
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:47,270
The pentacle is faith soared forward in using rents.

1794
02:17:48,069 --> 02:17:55,989
Turn degrees to describe a covernal signal constitutes the with reverence.

1795
02:17:55,989 --> 02:17:59,750
Turn to face north with exhaustion exclaim.

1796
02:18:00,309 --> 02:18:08,100
Some words missing there?

1797
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:10,819
All right.

1798
02:18:10,819 --> 02:18:18,059
This is important stuff here to rid the unfortunate body of its unclean blood

1799
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:21,579
skull dagger blood tree.

1800
02:18:22,139 --> 02:18:23,899
Remember those.

1801
02:18:25,719 --> 02:18:32,379
The body should be transferred to a casket of thick wood skull dagger blood tree.

1802
02:18:32,379 --> 02:18:36,579
I got blood sacrifice.

1803
02:18:36,579 --> 02:18:38,489
Is there more?

1804
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:42,790
All right.

1805
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:45,430
We got to have the skull, the dagger, the blood in the tree.

1806
02:18:46,069 --> 02:18:49,620
The sword forward.

1807
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,180
You, Brad?

1808
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:56,459
No, I'm reading a long, long, long thing that we need to, we got to have.

1809
02:18:56,459 --> 02:18:56,700
Okay.

1810
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:57,500
Sorry.

1811
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:59,739
I didn't realize I was, I thought I was looking at you anyway.

1812
02:18:59,739 --> 02:19:00,379
No.

1813
02:19:00,379 --> 02:19:00,860
Carry on.

1814
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:01,340
Carry on.

1815
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,479
Hey, are you Brad?

1816
02:19:05,479 --> 02:19:08,600
He's like, he's, he's in my game now and he's like being fucking weird.

1817
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:10,440
I just want to make sure that's not you.

1818
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:16,389
It's like, I got a weird phone call like a few hours ago and it kind of sounded like

1819
02:19:16,389 --> 02:19:17,510
your voice, you pranking me.

1820
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:19,350
Just want to make sure it's, just tell me.

1821
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:22,200
The pentacle is sacrifice.

1822
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,000
Page 34.

1823
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,500
Each member takes a step inward and then is still in the stance of Ram.

1824
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:30,309
Reciting unison.

1825
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:32,469
We are one and so is the Lord.

1826
02:19:32,469 --> 02:19:33,430
Oh, sore us.

1827
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:36,870
But the sacrifice we ask you to cleanse our aura to rid us of the demons that plague us.

1828
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:39,270
We spill the life of man in your honor.

1829
02:19:39,829 --> 02:19:42,549
That we may ourselves worthy of your trust.

1830
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:49,989
Only when the in can let should the five converge upon the S as drawn.

1831
02:19:50,549 --> 02:19:52,309
Each member should in turn to rid.

1832
02:19:52,309 --> 02:19:52,950
Okay.

1833
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:53,590
Good.

1834
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:57,079
Throw it in the fire.

1835
02:20:02,549 --> 02:20:03,829
Blood investigate.

1836
02:20:08,010 --> 02:20:08,889
Hey, are you Brad?

1837
02:20:09,690 --> 02:20:09,850
Yeah.

1838
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:12,809
Somebody joined our server and they're named, they're named Brad.

1839
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:14,420
Yeah.

1840
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,059
They're griefing.

1841
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:16,340
It's not you, right?

1842
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,459
Tell me if it's you.

1843
02:20:17,459 --> 02:20:22,219
Anything else on here?

1844
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:25,540
No.

1845
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:26,739
Where's that piano?

1846
02:20:26,819 --> 02:20:33,159
I want to play.

1847
02:20:33,159 --> 02:20:34,680
There has to be something with like the piano keys.

1848
02:20:46,149 --> 02:20:46,629
I knew it.

1849
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:10,920
I just stopped playing like a fucking evanescence.

1850
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:16,409
What was that?

1851
02:21:16,409 --> 02:21:21,620
What are you talking about?

1852
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:24,180
You guys didn't, everybody learned how to do that.

1853
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:25,139
Am I too old for that?

1854
02:21:25,139 --> 02:21:26,260
You guys, you guys might be too young.

1855
02:21:27,219 --> 02:21:29,139
Every single person learned how to do the

1856
02:21:30,739 --> 02:21:35,579
because that was like the most popular song in the world.

1857
02:21:46,899 --> 02:21:51,739
So go turn on the power.

1858
02:21:52,379 --> 02:21:57,530
Hooray.

1859
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:58,010
Hooray.

1860
02:21:58,010 --> 02:21:58,489
Hooray.

1861
02:21:58,489 --> 02:21:59,370
The thing's gonna go up.

1862
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:00,250
This is gonna be so fair.

1863
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:00,649
I knew it.

1864
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:06,180
Geez.

1865
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:07,930
Really?

1866
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:20,870
Yeah, probably incoming re here.

1867
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:21,750
This is blood.

1868
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:33,750
The skull.

1869
02:22:34,469 --> 02:22:35,909
I knew we were going to get read.

1870
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:39,579
Just grab it.

1871
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:48,469
Take the skull.

1872
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:59,260
What are you doing?

1873
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:00,379
Get the skull.

1874
02:23:00,379 --> 02:23:11,879
All right.

1875
02:23:11,879 --> 02:23:14,600
Apparently I can't pick up the skull, which I know I need it.

1876
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:22,549
Blood coming from the ceiling.

1877
02:23:32,739 --> 02:23:45,639
Well, just remember that there's a skull in there outside the boat.

1878
02:23:54,739 --> 02:23:58,219
Can I just jump over?

1879
02:24:08,459 --> 02:24:10,540
And what was I supposed to see something?

1880
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:12,469
What was I supposed to see?

1881
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:21,290
Wait, this is the same room.

1882
02:24:21,290 --> 02:24:31,799
So give me the skull.

1883
02:24:31,799 --> 02:24:33,479
This is the box in the beginning of the game.

1884
02:24:33,479 --> 02:24:47,000
That's the gold.

1885
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,920
Oh, so it's a gold.

1886
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:50,520
There's gold in there.

1887
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:55,260
Gold bars, gold coins.

1888
02:24:55,899 --> 02:24:57,420
And the government was trying to keep it.

1889
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:00,219
And it's a conspiracy.

1890
02:25:00,219 --> 02:25:07,100
Okay, this is the water coming down.

1891
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:07,739
Interesting.

1892
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:13,690
Cool.

1893
02:25:15,579 --> 02:25:17,739
Should I not be standing in this like gas?

1894
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:23,209
Did I go back in time?

1895
02:25:24,659 --> 02:25:25,700
Where's Brad?

1896
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:48,280
It's the same book, right?

1897
02:25:51,239 --> 02:25:52,520
This is the Satan book.

1898
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:56,409
Standard operating procedure for handling hazardous chemicals.

1899
02:25:57,290 --> 02:25:58,250
Department for...

1900
02:25:58,250 --> 02:25:58,889
It sure is.

1901
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:07,049
Avoid storing chemicals.

1902
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:10,659
Leaks the wire rope clean and stored in any chemicals.

1903
02:26:10,659 --> 02:26:11,379
Make certain that...

1904
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:14,069
What?

1905
02:26:14,069 --> 02:26:19,290
Its color band is...

1906
02:26:19,290 --> 02:26:20,090
Make certain that...

1907
02:26:21,209 --> 02:26:22,409
It's properly marked before.

1908
02:26:23,209 --> 02:26:27,049
Its color band is visible so the cargo can be identified quickly.

1909
02:26:27,049 --> 02:26:28,649
Refer to paragraph 26B.

1910
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:32,250
The cargo must be secured to avoid movement during passage.

1911
02:26:33,049 --> 02:26:36,569
Pass the stowage with fresh water.

1912
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:40,120
Grease to drums help protect them.

1913
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:41,959
Water during stowage.

1914
02:26:43,209 --> 02:26:46,250
During inspection, stowage procedures.

1915
02:26:47,129 --> 02:26:48,649
The marking on any container.

1916
02:26:50,170 --> 02:26:51,690
And consult the Navy shipment.

1917
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:53,610
Marking handbook if required to determine.

1918
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:57,770
Why am I reading this shit?

1919
02:26:57,770 --> 02:26:59,049
Because I don't know.

1920
02:26:59,049 --> 02:26:59,930
It might be important.

1921
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:03,979
Is it not important?

1922
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:07,139
Why would I read this shit?

1923
02:27:08,819 --> 02:27:10,340
I feel like this is important stuff.

1924
02:27:11,139 --> 02:27:15,750
Does it look important?

1925
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,219
I don't know.

1926
02:27:19,180 --> 02:27:26,340
What do you mean does it look important?

1927
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:28,579
It's a hazardous chemical removal.

1928
02:27:28,579 --> 02:27:29,940
Yes, it is very important.

1929
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:49,020
Another dead person.

1930
02:27:54,889 --> 02:27:55,450
Wait, this is...

1931
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,729
Wait, wait, this is where Charlie was.

1932
02:27:59,059 --> 02:27:59,559
Uh-oh.

1933
02:28:06,809 --> 02:28:07,530
Now it...

1934
02:28:07,530 --> 02:28:10,829
What?

1935
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:12,569
There's the guy with the hat on.

1936
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:19,659
It's...

1937
02:28:19,659 --> 02:28:20,860
Oh, there's Brad.

1938
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:22,579
Hey, are you Brad?

1939
02:28:23,379 --> 02:28:23,860
Just like...

1940
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:24,340
I'm just...

1941
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:24,819
I need to know.

1942
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:27,420
Brad.

1943
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:27,979
Are you Brad?

1944
02:28:27,979 --> 02:28:29,420
Can I tell you this information?

1945
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:31,979
Can I...

1946
02:28:31,979 --> 02:28:32,620
What?

1947
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,260
Are you trying to...

1948
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:35,899
All right, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.

1949
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:39,459
Hey, what's wrong?

1950
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:43,319
What the fuck?

1951
02:28:43,959 --> 02:28:46,040
Did I make this in the movies?

1952
02:29:07,690 --> 02:29:08,729
Wait, did I...

1953
02:29:08,729 --> 02:29:09,690
I spoiled it?

1954
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:28,969
Hey, are you Brad?

1955
02:29:35,059 --> 02:29:37,620
Well, he asked me earlier if I was Brad.

1956
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:39,379
I was confirming the same thing with him.

1957
02:29:50,709 --> 02:29:52,629
We both spoiled each other's game?

1958
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:56,540
No, we didn't.

1959
02:29:59,530 --> 02:30:01,049
W doesn't exist?

1960
02:30:01,049 --> 02:30:01,930
What the fuck?

1961
02:30:02,889 --> 02:30:04,409
I am so mad right now.

1962
02:30:04,409 --> 02:30:04,889
I think...

1963
02:30:04,889 --> 02:30:05,610
I think I killed him.

1964
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:13,059
What is happening?

1965
02:30:13,059 --> 02:30:14,340
I can't move the controller.

1966
02:30:27,059 --> 02:30:29,299
It's switching from keyboard to fucking controller.

1967
02:30:30,979 --> 02:30:31,540
On a whim.

1968
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:33,059
When it decides to.

1969
02:31:00,149 --> 02:31:00,870
All right.

1970
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:35,850
You okay?

1971
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:38,629
That guy saved you.

1972
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:41,719
He tried to kill me.

1973
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,559
Thanks.

1974
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:45,899
I could have drowned.

1975
02:31:45,899 --> 02:31:49,590
I can't believe it.

1976
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:50,229
You killed him.

1977
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:51,989
You killed him.

1978
02:31:51,989 --> 02:31:52,489
I did.

1979
02:31:54,569 --> 02:31:55,209
No, I didn't.

1980
02:31:55,209 --> 02:31:55,709
He's fine.

1981
02:31:57,049 --> 02:32:39,209
Now I'm back here.

1982
02:32:39,209 --> 02:32:39,709
Okay.

1983
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:45,610
Hey, are you Brad?

1984
02:32:45,610 --> 02:32:46,649
Brad's in front of me right now.

1985
02:32:46,649 --> 02:32:47,209
I'm just...

1986
02:32:47,209 --> 02:32:49,530
Listen, I don't know anything that's happening.

1987
02:32:50,569 --> 02:32:51,290
I'm just kidding.

1988
02:32:51,290 --> 02:32:52,090
I'm kidding.

1989
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:53,290
It's weird.

1990
02:32:53,290 --> 02:32:55,290
I have no clue what's going on.

1991
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:59,450
Not in like the good way either.

1992
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:01,209
Like the literally just...

1993
02:33:01,209 --> 02:33:02,569
And fucking keyboard.

1994
02:33:02,569 --> 02:33:02,809
All right.

1995
02:33:02,809 --> 02:33:03,370
I got to mute.

1996
02:33:04,409 --> 02:33:05,719
Wait.

1997
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:06,200
No, that's you.

1998
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:06,600
That's you.

1999
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,000
That is you.

2000
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:10,540
No, that's not you.

2001
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:11,100
Are you Brad?

2002
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:14,489
Stop asking that.

2003
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:16,250
All right.

2004
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:17,209
You have to sit on board.

2005
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,739
All right.

2006
02:33:35,739 --> 02:33:37,739
I'm understanding what's happening in this game.

2007
02:33:38,299 --> 02:33:40,379
So we're not supposed to be working together.

2008
02:33:42,979 --> 02:33:44,819
Us doing this in co-op.

2009
02:33:44,899 --> 02:33:46,180
It was like a bad idea.

2010
02:33:46,739 --> 02:33:49,159
We were supposed to just like be playing together.

2011
02:33:49,159 --> 02:33:50,200
Like, hey, what do you find?

2012
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:51,639
What'd you find over there?

2013
02:33:51,639 --> 02:34:03,940
Are we Brad?

2014
02:34:04,579 --> 02:34:11,989
No, I realized that like 20 minutes ago.

2015
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,479
I realized that after he asked me if I was Brad.

2016
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:23,239
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

2017
02:34:23,239 --> 02:34:23,879
And then I had...

2018
02:34:23,879 --> 02:34:25,000
And then he was Brad.

2019
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:25,479
You know what I mean?

2020
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:27,879
That was a cycle that we were in.

2021
02:34:31,979 --> 02:34:37,459
And yes, I know that hitting the key is changing the keyboard.

2022
02:34:37,459 --> 02:34:38,260
I know.

2023
02:34:51,059 --> 02:34:54,100
Guys, I knew that after the first 200 people said it.

2024
02:34:54,969 --> 02:35:13,829
But really, why is it taking so long?

2025
02:35:13,829 --> 02:35:15,430
Just can't open this thing by myself.

2026
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,280
Alex has found his secret.

2027
02:35:23,719 --> 02:35:25,479
See, we went into this thing and it was going to be like,

2028
02:35:25,479 --> 02:35:27,399
oh, it's like a co-op horror experience.

2029
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:30,200
No, we're actively playing like against each other.

2030
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,079
And we just don't even know.

2031
02:35:37,530 --> 02:35:38,809
Mad because Brad.

2032
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:51,959
Because we like aren't supposed to be sharing information with each other then.

2033
02:35:51,959 --> 02:35:52,520
You know what I mean?

2034
02:35:53,079 --> 02:35:57,930
It's going to be lobster under here, I hope.

2035
02:35:58,489 --> 02:36:22,659
Yeah, we're like hallucinating.

2036
02:36:22,659 --> 02:36:24,020
The monster and somebody...

2037
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:26,260
Oh, no, you're the monster.

2038
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:27,379
You just strangled that guy.

2039
02:36:27,379 --> 02:36:27,860
You killed...

2040
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:29,219
That's not Brad.

2041
02:36:29,219 --> 02:36:29,700
That's me.

2042
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,579
That's not a monster.

2043
02:36:31,579 --> 02:36:31,979
It's me.

2044
02:36:39,909 --> 02:36:46,250
Just like it was in the beginning of the game.

2045
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:50,620
Oh, what's it have?

2046
02:37:06,659 --> 02:37:08,100
Mad because Brad.

2047
02:37:21,239 --> 02:37:22,200
That's fucking funny.

2048
02:37:24,170 --> 02:37:24,889
That's a good one.

2049
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:28,340
All right, let's use the key in the safe.

2050
02:37:29,139 --> 02:37:43,829
All right, what does it say?

2051
02:37:43,829 --> 02:37:46,680
What does it say?

2052
02:37:47,399 --> 02:37:47,799
Read it.

2053
02:37:50,489 --> 02:37:51,530
Not read the letter.

2054
02:37:52,090 --> 02:37:54,540
I thought saves don't use keys.

2055
02:37:54,540 --> 02:37:54,940
They don't...

2056
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:58,149
I mean, maybe back in like the fucking 20s.

2057
02:38:02,569 --> 02:38:04,489
Summary of Manchurian Gold.

2058
02:38:04,489 --> 02:38:08,649
Study of response of human beings to ingesting chemical designate Manchurian Gold.

2059
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:11,000
Okay.

2060
02:38:11,719 --> 02:38:16,120
Chemical ingesting crystal dust form by subjects A, B, C, D, and E.

2061
02:38:17,290 --> 02:38:20,010
All volunteers provided by base sergeant.

2062
02:38:24,659 --> 02:38:25,459
Test successful.

2063
02:38:25,459 --> 02:38:30,100
Results consistent with biological specimen test reports in supplied files.

2064
02:38:30,659 --> 02:38:32,219
Full report forthcoming.

2065
02:38:32,219 --> 02:38:35,420
Further studies strongly recommend a stimulus response relationship

2066
02:38:35,420 --> 02:38:36,940
in subjects under influence of chemical.

2067
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:41,000
Please note, latest test results do not supersede...

2068
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,520
So the Manchurian Gold is just a bunch of unstable chemicals.

2069
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:50,120
High caution must be taken to avoid exposure of chemicals to solution,

2070
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:51,399
extreme heat, and electricity.

2071
02:38:53,829 --> 02:38:54,709
Five subjects.

2072
02:38:56,329 --> 02:38:57,610
Right, okay.

2073
02:38:57,690 --> 02:39:09,450
All right, where else should I go?

2074
02:39:10,329 --> 02:39:15,719
Can I go in any of these other doors?

2075
02:39:21,379 --> 02:39:21,860
Pause the game.

2076
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:22,979
I gotta fill my water bottle.

2077
02:39:23,620 --> 02:39:31,899
Oh, God.

2078
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:35,670
It's me.

2079
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:41,159
Hello?

2080
02:39:41,159 --> 02:39:42,200
Oh, it's me.

2081
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:42,760
It's Bliss.

2082
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:43,239
It's okay.

2083
02:39:50,020 --> 02:39:50,899
This is Italian.

2084
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:55,879
Should I even say...

2085
02:39:55,879 --> 02:39:56,440
Are you Brad?

2086
02:39:57,559 --> 02:39:59,399
Like, I keep running into Brad.

2087
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:15,479
No, but he...

2088
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:15,959
Okay.

2089
02:40:15,959 --> 02:40:16,840
But he doesn't know.

2090
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:19,239
So he's gonna like kill me.

2091
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:22,459
What's going on with that light?

2092
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:25,930
I just missed the QTE because of that.

2093
02:40:36,139 --> 02:40:37,420
I'm just chasing him down.

2094
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:51,819
It's me.

2095
02:40:51,819 --> 02:40:52,459
It's Bliss.

2096
02:40:52,459 --> 02:40:53,180
I see.

2097
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:54,219
I know what's happening.

2098
02:40:55,979 --> 02:41:08,620
So I'm reading this thing here.

2099
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:09,659
It says that this...

2100
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:13,030
It says like a pentagram on it and shit.

2101
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:15,030
I'm like, I've been reading it for like 40 minutes.

2102
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:16,309
It seems like pretty important.

2103
02:41:18,299 --> 02:41:19,899
Yeah, it's weird.

2104
02:41:19,899 --> 02:41:20,700
Because in my game...

2105
02:41:21,979 --> 02:41:22,700
What have you been doing?

2106
02:41:23,909 --> 02:41:26,629
I've been like really just bored reading material.

2107
02:41:26,629 --> 02:41:28,950
Well, see, me and the other character are playing checkers.

2108
02:41:29,989 --> 02:41:32,709
We said whoever loses has to cook dinner tonight.

2109
02:41:34,729 --> 02:41:35,850
Oh, that's weird.

2110
02:41:36,809 --> 02:41:37,049
All right.

2111
02:41:37,049 --> 02:41:39,610
I'm gonna get back to reading, I guess.

2112
02:41:40,649 --> 02:41:41,129
Yeah.

2113
02:41:41,129 --> 02:41:42,569
No, there's a lot of books in the game.

2114
02:41:42,569 --> 02:41:43,770
There are too many books.

2115
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:44,809
It's like kind of ridiculous.

2116
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:48,139
But it's all good.

2117
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:50,409
This one here.

2118
02:41:51,209 --> 02:41:53,270
You're gonna get ca-

2119
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:55,459
This one here.

2120
02:41:55,459 --> 02:41:56,579
This is too long.

2121
02:41:56,579 --> 02:41:58,180
I'm just gonna leave this room, guys.

2122
02:41:58,180 --> 02:41:59,219
It's like way too long.

2123
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:09,700
I guess I'll try to play piano again.

2124
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:23,540
I almost missed that.

2125
02:42:39,989 --> 02:42:41,350
Should I stop like-

2126
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:41,750
It's weird.

2127
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:42,549
Like I'm at the buffet.

2128
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:44,520
You're at a buffet.

2129
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:48,840
There's a bunch of like just elderly cruise liner type buffet people here.

2130
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:51,559
Just clamoring for the free cheeseburger line.

2131
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:54,489
This game's fucking boring, then.

2132
02:42:55,209 --> 02:42:57,370
Because I'm literally just walking around the same room.

2133
02:42:59,829 --> 02:43:01,190
Playing the fucking piano.

2134
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:02,069
It's like terrible.

2135
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:07,379
I didn't think it was this boring.

2136
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:12,139
Is it?

2137
02:43:12,139 --> 02:43:13,100
Somebody's in the window.

2138
02:43:13,739 --> 02:43:14,860
You got somebody in the window?

2139
02:43:16,219 --> 02:43:16,780
What the fuck?

2140
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:19,379
There's a face in the window here.

2141
02:43:48,950 --> 02:43:49,670
Fresh air.

2142
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:50,149
Yeah, that's right.

2143
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,629
I'm still in the-

2144
02:43:58,629 --> 02:43:59,430
Wait, what the fuck was that?

2145
02:43:59,989 --> 02:44:03,819
I've been in a loading screen for like five minutes.

2146
02:44:03,819 --> 02:44:04,620
What the fuck is that?

2147
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:06,760
Oh, it's Brad.

2148
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:07,159
Are you Brad?

2149
02:44:07,159 --> 02:44:07,879
Are you controlling Brad?

2150
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:09,000
He's in the piano room with me now.

2151
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:13,639
Actually, I found out if you just don't play the game for about five minutes,

2152
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:15,479
the AI takes over.

2153
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:18,649
All right.

2154
02:44:18,649 --> 02:44:19,209
It's us.

2155
02:44:19,209 --> 02:44:20,170
This is us.

2156
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:20,649
Get ready.

2157
02:44:32,629 --> 02:44:33,829
Am I Alex or are you Alex?

2158
02:44:33,829 --> 02:44:34,309
Who was it?

2159
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:36,229
I am Julia.

2160
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,909
Okay, so I'm Alex.

2161
02:44:38,709 --> 02:44:42,260
Imagine maybe to look at your feet to walk up the stairs.

2162
02:44:42,819 --> 02:44:46,020
Like imagine if you look at your hands when you punch the keys on the keyboard.

2163
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:53,639
I can barely hear you over this.

2164
02:44:56,629 --> 02:44:56,870
Jump.

2165
02:44:57,909 --> 02:44:58,629
That's what I did too.

2166
02:44:59,190 --> 02:44:59,989
That's what I did too.

2167
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:15,459
I don't know if you're actually Alex.

2168
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:16,979
Oh, you are.

2169
02:45:16,979 --> 02:45:17,299
Okay.

2170
02:45:17,299 --> 02:45:18,180
You're deciding.

2171
02:45:19,139 --> 02:45:19,780
Yeah, we're going.

2172
02:45:30,100 --> 02:45:30,579
Harm Rad.

2173
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:33,239
Help me.

2174
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:35,590
Close it.

2175
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:35,989
Lock it.

2176
02:45:40,329 --> 02:45:40,969
Work.

2177
02:45:40,969 --> 02:45:41,610
Nice job.

2178
02:45:46,170 --> 02:45:46,809
Are you Brad?

2179
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:49,770
Am I Brad?

2180
02:45:49,770 --> 02:45:50,569
Are you Brad?

2181
02:45:50,569 --> 02:45:51,129
You have to be.

2182
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:52,969
There's so many people.

2183
02:46:02,299 --> 02:46:03,100
Who's Brad?

2184
02:46:04,059 --> 02:46:08,379
Oh, we're playing in five player mode the whole time.

2185
02:46:09,659 --> 02:46:14,010
We've only been controlling one character each.

2186
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:15,850
So we're all, everyone's still alive.

2187
02:46:15,850 --> 02:46:17,770
We did a phenomenal fucking job.

2188
02:46:18,489 --> 02:46:19,049
Chad is Brad.

2189
02:46:22,700 --> 02:46:33,799
So by the way, there was a period about five minutes that I was not here during the last chapter.

2190
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:35,979
I was gone.

2191
02:46:35,979 --> 02:46:37,020
You were actually gone.

2192
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:37,659
Oh, hello.

2193
02:46:37,659 --> 02:46:37,819
Yeah.

2194
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,360
Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?

2195
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:45,000
Were you Brad?

2196
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:47,899
I mean that sincerely.

2197
02:46:47,899 --> 02:46:49,260
Like the chapter's over.

2198
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:49,659
Okay.

2199
02:46:49,659 --> 02:46:50,139
Like.

2200
02:46:50,139 --> 02:46:50,540
Yeah.

2201
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:51,260
Chapter's over.

2202
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:51,739
Are you Brad?

2203
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:55,940
I was Brad for a time.

2204
02:46:56,979 --> 02:46:58,819
Brad made some questionable decisions.

2205
02:46:58,819 --> 02:47:00,120
How to stop it.

2206
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:03,719
How to save the lives of your four unfortunate stowaways.

2207
02:47:04,979 --> 02:47:06,739
You will, I hope.

2208
02:47:06,739 --> 02:47:07,620
They said four?

2209
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:10,979
Although it seems the ship's previous occupants never managed to.

2210
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:14,680
Quite a lot of deaths that night.

2211
02:47:15,319 --> 02:47:18,729
Let me help you out.

2212
02:47:18,729 --> 02:47:19,850
Give you a little hint.

2213
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:21,209
Need a Brad flow chart.

2214
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:24,950
No, I don't.

2215
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:25,670
No spoilers.

2216
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:26,309
Get out of here.

2217
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:28,469
No hint.

2218
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:33,780
Perhaps you think you can piece things together from the clues you found yourself.

2219
02:47:34,739 --> 02:47:36,020
Good luck with that.

2220
02:47:36,899 --> 02:47:41,700
Perhaps you've started to realize something.

2221
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:46,100
This is just the guy that binge watched the whole season before you've had time to sit down and watch.

2222
02:47:46,739 --> 02:47:48,420
He may not be dying.

2223
02:47:48,420 --> 02:47:49,379
Talk about what he thinks.

2224
02:47:51,219 --> 02:47:51,860
Whoa!

2225
02:47:51,860 --> 02:47:52,739
I hope that helps.

2226
02:47:52,739 --> 02:47:54,340
Welcome to Pell and Tell or Fool Us.

2227
02:47:55,139 --> 02:47:55,780
At Fool Us.

2228
02:47:55,780 --> 02:48:00,180
Well, I'm so excited to find out what your poor unfortunates are making of all this and how

2229
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:03,620
you might avoid any more unnecessary tragedy.

2230
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:05,219
Go on.

2231
02:48:05,219 --> 02:48:05,780
Back to it.

2232
02:48:06,969 --> 02:48:07,690
Speak soon.

2233
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:13,719
Panda Fate 3.

2234
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,090
Have fun.

2235
02:48:17,739 --> 02:48:18,540
Okay.

2236
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:19,260
We know who we are.

2237
02:48:19,899 --> 02:48:22,680
What the hell is wrong with you back there?

2238
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:23,639
I have to pee.

2239
02:48:23,639 --> 02:48:25,239
Brad, you lost your shit.

2240
02:48:25,239 --> 02:48:25,879
I did too.

2241
02:48:25,879 --> 02:48:26,840
That's why I was gone.

2242
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:27,879
What are you talking about?

2243
02:48:27,879 --> 02:48:28,379
Come on.

2244
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:29,159
No.

2245
02:48:29,159 --> 02:48:29,399
Come on.

2246
02:48:29,399 --> 02:48:30,200
That's ridiculous.

2247
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,680
What the fuck is going on with this shit?

2248
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:33,959
That was a pretty good Jay Leno impression.

2249
02:48:33,959 --> 02:48:35,000
I gotta be honest.

2250
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,639
It feels like there's some like, like evil, like literal evil going on down there.

2251
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:43,399
Let's just stay calm and relatively sane about this.

2252
02:48:43,399 --> 02:48:43,899
Okay?

2253
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:45,719
This stuff I saw.

2254
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:49,239
It's like there were these old soldiers and they were bodies.

2255
02:48:49,239 --> 02:48:50,280
They were dead, but then-

2256
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:51,399
This is all your fault, by the way.

2257
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:53,000
It might be.

2258
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,040
Doesn't sound that crazy right about now.

2259
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:00,280
If you don't ever split up, nothing bad can happen.

2260
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:02,440
That shit crazy like dinosaur old.

2261
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:05,000
Not that that's a bad thing, but she just like up and vanished on.

2262
02:49:05,639 --> 02:49:07,399
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

2263
02:49:07,399 --> 02:49:08,280
Who are you talking about?

2264
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:12,280
There were things walking around with his face on them.

2265
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:13,239
Alex's face.

2266
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:15,319
It was horrifying.

2267
02:49:15,319 --> 02:49:16,280
Hey, whoa, whoa.

2268
02:49:21,879 --> 02:49:22,520
My face?

2269
02:49:23,479 --> 02:49:25,219
That never hurt you.

2270
02:49:25,219 --> 02:49:26,020
That's rude.

2271
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:27,219
You know that, right?

2272
02:49:27,219 --> 02:49:27,860
No, I know.

2273
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:29,540
It's just, let's-

2274
02:49:29,540 --> 02:49:30,340
No, I'm Alex.

2275
02:49:30,340 --> 02:49:30,840
Okay?

2276
02:49:31,459 --> 02:49:34,659
This place is too fucked up to just be fucked up.

2277
02:49:34,659 --> 02:49:35,379
You know what I'm saying?

2278
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:38,020
I mean, like something is going on here.

2279
02:49:39,659 --> 02:49:42,059
So what do we know for sure that we can all agree on?

2280
02:49:42,059 --> 02:49:42,459
Chemicals.

2281
02:49:42,459 --> 02:49:43,180
You breathe in a minute.

2282
02:49:44,540 --> 02:49:45,899
It's a ghost ship.

2283
02:49:45,899 --> 02:49:46,219
Wow.

2284
02:49:46,219 --> 02:49:47,659
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.

2285
02:49:47,659 --> 02:49:48,860
Did you see a ghost or anything?

2286
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:49,500
We're turning to water.

2287
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:51,899
Manchurian gold isn't actually gold.

2288
02:49:51,899 --> 02:49:54,860
It's a fucking chemical and it's leaking all over cargo hold to-

2289
02:49:55,579 --> 02:49:58,299
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this isn't exactly what our

2290
02:49:58,299 --> 02:50:00,139
friendly fishermen are expecting either.

2291
02:50:01,340 --> 02:50:02,379
This should go over well.

2292
02:50:07,059 --> 02:50:09,379
What do you think actually happened on this ship?

2293
02:50:09,379 --> 02:50:11,700
A goddamn mystery box is what it is.

2294
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:13,219
The ship was bound for San Francisco.

2295
02:50:13,219 --> 02:50:13,860
Mystery box?

2296
02:50:13,860 --> 02:50:16,579
But it hailed from a water purification plant in China.

2297
02:50:17,139 --> 02:50:19,620
Apparently that's where it picked up the Manchurian gold.

2298
02:50:20,340 --> 02:50:22,500
I saw 1947 on the newspaper.

2299
02:50:24,659 --> 02:50:25,780
Is this a ghost ship?

2300
02:50:26,739 --> 02:50:27,860
I mean, I guess-

2301
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:32,280
Am I crazy or are we on a ghost ship?

2302
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:34,920
Like ghost ships are real and this is one and we're totally on it.

2303
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:37,239
And no, holy shit, we're so totally fucked.

2304
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:39,780
I was going to say the same thing.

2305
02:50:39,780 --> 02:50:41,059
Pretty quick tonal change there.

2306
02:50:41,059 --> 02:50:44,819
According to this letter I found, the guards here were absolutely terrified of something.

2307
02:50:44,819 --> 02:50:45,219
I agree.

2308
02:50:45,219 --> 02:50:46,340
Everything you say, honey.

2309
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:49,299
We found a note that said a bunch of guys tried to get out of guard duty

2310
02:50:49,299 --> 02:50:51,139
because they were really freaked out by something.

2311
02:50:56,020 --> 02:50:57,299
This place is weird.

2312
02:50:57,299 --> 02:50:58,819
There's a lot of unnatural shit going on here.

2313
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,180
It is unsuper freaking natural.

2314
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:04,100
Everything about this place is wrong.

2315
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:05,379
We know more than we did before.

2316
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:07,940
That's something at least.

2317
02:51:07,940 --> 02:51:09,379
We're wasting time.

2318
02:51:09,379 --> 02:51:10,899
Whatever we do, we have to do it now.

2319
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:12,659
Time to get off this ship.

2320
02:51:13,299 --> 02:51:15,860
We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.

2321
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:17,059
The duke needs it to run.

2322
02:51:17,059 --> 02:51:17,559
Nope.

2323
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:18,500
Hold on.

2324
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:19,620
We can leave it.

2325
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,620
This ship's gotta have a radio.

2326
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:22,739
Time for the radio quest.

2327
02:51:22,739 --> 02:51:24,100
If we can find it and use it.

2328
02:51:25,299 --> 02:51:27,139
That's great, but do you think it still works?

2329
02:51:27,700 --> 02:51:29,540
We just need to find a way up there.

2330
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:31,139
Time for the radio fetch quest.

2331
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:40,709
All right, we got the whole party here.

2332
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:48,360
Okay, I'm Alex.

2333
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:50,280
We gotta get out of this damn ship.

2334
02:51:51,559 --> 02:51:52,440
No shit.

2335
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:54,840
It's a classic problem.

2336
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:55,879
Who am I?

2337
02:51:55,879 --> 02:51:57,159
Totally effed.

2338
02:51:57,159 --> 02:51:58,200
You're Alex, okay.

2339
02:51:58,200 --> 02:51:59,319
Yeah, I am Alex.

2340
02:51:59,319 --> 02:52:00,360
Okay, you were just Alex.

2341
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:03,319
I walked into a corner, but I thought you were walking into a corner.

2342
02:52:03,319 --> 02:52:05,159
Yeah, this is why I was confused.

2343
02:52:05,159 --> 02:52:09,879
Because you were Alex 15 seconds ago, and then it just gave me control over Alex.

2344
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:13,399
Yeah, I've been told in local mode you get to pick who you want to be.

2345
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:16,120
It's weird that you don't just pick who you want to be.

2346
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:17,959
Yeah, why can't we just choose?

2347
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:24,139
Cigar?

2348
02:52:24,139 --> 02:52:30,250
I know it sounds crazy, but maybe it was these guns that took down the plane from our dive.

2349
02:52:33,290 --> 02:52:35,129
I guess I'm just standing over your shoulder.

2350
02:52:35,129 --> 02:52:36,329
Am I handing this to you?

2351
02:52:38,979 --> 02:52:39,479
Have we?

2352
02:52:41,299 --> 02:52:43,379
Did you just pass the lore baton to me?

2353
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:47,299
Here, you look at this.

2354
02:52:47,299 --> 02:52:48,260
Oh, you put this back.

2355
02:52:48,260 --> 02:52:48,819
I'm done with this.

2356
02:52:48,819 --> 02:52:49,940
I didn't even say anything.

2357
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:53,299
Not even one line of dialogue.

2358
02:52:53,299 --> 02:52:55,059
Just I set it back down for you.

2359
02:52:55,059 --> 02:52:56,420
Yeah, you put this away.

2360
02:52:57,540 --> 02:52:59,459
Honey, I left my play chat again for dinner.

2361
02:52:59,459 --> 02:52:59,780
Thank you.

2362
02:53:01,459 --> 02:53:02,709
Can you clean them up now?

2363
02:53:07,270 --> 02:53:08,229
We could use this boat.

2364
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:13,260
Great.

2365
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:14,680
Do I have to come?

2366
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:14,920
Do I have to come?

2367
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:18,540
Confirm.

2368
02:53:18,540 --> 02:53:19,899
All right, it's got holes in it.

2369
02:53:19,899 --> 02:53:21,020
Let's go get some duct tape.

2370
02:53:21,739 --> 02:53:31,780
You can put duct tape on it.

2371
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:33,139
All the characters are together.

2372
02:53:33,139 --> 02:53:36,180
Seems like they should exchange everything that they've learned so far.

2373
02:53:38,059 --> 02:53:39,739
We're silently just walking around.

2374
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:48,219
It just feels like really empty in these parts where it's just

2375
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:55,340
there's five people and we're all just NPC walking around.

2376
02:53:59,819 --> 02:54:03,260
Like, yeah, just some dialogue or some back and forth or something.

2377
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:06,920
What is that?

2378
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,239
Hey, a little help over here.

2379
02:54:15,239 --> 02:54:17,159
Oh, yeah, we're actually playing Spy Party now, aren't we?

2380
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:19,479
I think this is our way up.

2381
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:21,780
Give me a lift.

2382
02:54:29,219 --> 02:54:31,219
Okay, I was gonna say if there's a QTE available, fail it.

2383
02:54:31,219 --> 02:54:31,700
I'll pull you up.

2384
02:54:33,059 --> 02:54:43,350
See, there he goes.

2385
02:54:43,909 --> 02:54:46,389
That's like a standard NPC walk up the stairs.

2386
02:54:57,659 --> 02:54:58,139
My turn.

2387
02:54:58,700 --> 02:55:10,889
These are the heaviest characters too.

2388
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:15,049
Yeah, they do feel like they're way like full of concrete.

2389
02:55:15,049 --> 02:55:16,010
Like there's shoes of concrete.

2390
02:55:16,010 --> 02:55:17,290
Don't waste your time looking.

2391
02:55:17,290 --> 02:55:18,649
Nope, don't go this way.

2392
02:55:18,649 --> 02:55:21,209
Just go the other way because there's nothing there.

2393
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:23,770
We're just all walking around without mouths open.

2394
02:55:24,649 --> 02:55:32,520
This is where I chased Conrad before.

2395
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:35,799
This is where I chased Conrad.

2396
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:38,979
So that was me being chased.

2397
02:55:40,870 --> 02:55:43,719
Oh, that was you being chased by Conrad.

2398
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:49,829
No, I was being chased as Conrad.

2399
02:55:52,549 --> 02:55:53,049
Wow.

2400
02:55:56,739 --> 02:55:57,239
Wow.

2401
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:04,260
No wonder they have such a hard time.

2402
02:56:04,260 --> 02:56:04,760
Here we go.

2403
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:07,940
We're gonna do the five person push through the door.

2404
02:56:09,219 --> 02:56:24,489
Jesus.

2405
02:56:25,209 --> 02:56:26,889
Maybe they didn't write the dialogue

2406
02:56:26,889 --> 02:56:28,649
because half the people that play this game

2407
02:56:28,649 --> 02:56:29,930
lose a character by this point.

2408
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:30,969
So they just didn't.

2409
02:56:30,969 --> 02:56:31,770
Oh, shit.

2410
02:56:31,770 --> 02:56:32,889
That's right.

2411
02:56:32,889 --> 02:56:33,530
That's true.

2412
02:56:34,409 --> 02:56:38,649
Now it makes sense because they might not even be here.

2413
02:56:38,649 --> 02:56:40,489
Someone's supposed to be dead by now.

2414
02:56:40,489 --> 02:56:42,409
So let's not even write them lines.

2415
02:56:42,409 --> 02:56:43,049
That's true.

2416
02:56:44,719 --> 02:56:45,680
I didn't even think about that.

2417
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:47,280
They really are just ghost NPCs

2418
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,520
because they're not supposed to even be here potentially.

2419
02:56:52,219 --> 02:56:52,719
Wow.

2420
02:56:55,959 --> 02:56:56,760
Interesting stuff.

2421
02:56:57,319 --> 02:57:06,399
I really shouldn't be laughing.

2422
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,879
But also...

2423
02:57:08,879 --> 02:57:09,600
Can I get out of here?

2424
02:57:10,559 --> 02:57:12,250
How did we leave this room?

2425
02:57:13,129 --> 02:57:13,850
It was funny.

2426
02:57:14,569 --> 02:57:23,639
What was in here?

2427
02:57:23,639 --> 02:57:26,459
I haven't found a radio yet.

2428
02:57:26,459 --> 02:57:28,299
No, but there's gotta be a radio on this shit.

2429
02:57:28,299 --> 02:57:31,079
Yeah, that makes sense.

2430
02:57:31,079 --> 02:57:32,440
Just put Julia here.

2431
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:35,079
She sits there.

2432
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:36,440
She's just completely out of the way.

2433
02:57:37,399 --> 02:57:38,760
She has no reactions.

2434
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:40,280
She's not supposed to be here.

2435
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:45,159
Oh, I found another book.

2436
02:57:45,159 --> 02:57:53,899
A blank painting.

2437
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:56,559
I got Behring updated.

2438
02:57:58,780 --> 02:57:59,340
The world.

2439
02:58:00,219 --> 02:58:00,940
Secret found.

2440
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:05,450
China to America.

2441
02:58:06,559 --> 02:58:07,520
And then we got another...

2442
02:58:08,809 --> 02:58:11,850
This is the boat that the beginning of the game started with.

2443
02:58:12,889 --> 02:58:15,340
So it was coming from China.

2444
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:20,219
China to America.

2445
02:58:20,219 --> 02:58:20,940
And then it goes...

2446
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:23,260
And then the red gets stuck over here.

2447
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:24,059
That's where we are.

2448
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:33,639
What is this?

2449
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,040
Are we already separated?

2450
02:58:38,040 --> 02:58:38,920
Yes, I think so.

2451
02:58:39,719 --> 02:58:40,280
Technically.

2452
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,239
Where else?

2453
02:58:41,239 --> 02:58:42,520
We're just walking around.

2454
02:58:43,159 --> 02:58:47,260
What does this say?

2455
02:58:49,610 --> 02:58:52,329
Uh, ship was blown off course.

2456
02:58:52,329 --> 02:58:53,450
Cloud cover was bad.

2457
02:58:53,450 --> 02:58:54,649
Yeah, she is just sitting there, huh?

2458
02:58:54,649 --> 02:58:55,850
They couldn't establish a position.

2459
02:58:56,649 --> 02:58:57,129
Storm.

2460
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:59,049
It says lightning strikes.

2461
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:03,680
Search for crew member overboard.

2462
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:04,959
Search called off.

2463
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:05,760
No comment.

2464
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:06,479
Is this us?

2465
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:09,000
I think that's us.

2466
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,440
Funny streamer, make me laugh.

2467
02:59:11,399 --> 02:59:11,959
All right, fine.

2468
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:14,440
No, I was just reading it.

2469
02:59:17,159 --> 02:59:19,559
Like you were asking me to do that?

2470
02:59:19,559 --> 02:59:20,600
Hey, funny streamer.

2471
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:22,360
I have your stream open while I play co-op.

2472
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:23,959
I'm watching your stream right now.

2473
02:59:23,959 --> 02:59:25,159
Do something funny.

2474
02:59:25,159 --> 02:59:26,680
No freaking way.

2475
02:59:27,319 --> 02:59:29,159
This thing actually still works?

2476
02:59:29,159 --> 02:59:32,600
Well, radio science hasn't changed much in seven years.

2477
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:34,120
As long as there's power.

2478
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:35,000
I'll give it a whirl.

2479
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:37,479
How are we still getting power?

2480
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:40,190
It's ghost power.

2481
02:59:40,190 --> 02:59:40,829
Ghost energy.

2482
02:59:41,629 --> 02:59:43,069
It's working.

2483
02:59:43,790 --> 02:59:44,670
You have to go very far.

2484
02:59:46,729 --> 02:59:47,530
Storm Thursday.

2485
02:59:49,739 --> 02:59:50,540
Beast pressure.

2486
02:59:57,450 --> 02:59:58,170
Oh, I skipped it.

2487
02:59:58,729 --> 02:59:59,930
Military battery.

2488
02:59:59,930 --> 03:00:00,489
You skipped it.

2489
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:02,170
How do you skip it?

2490
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:06,729
You skipped the cut scene?

2491
03:00:06,729 --> 03:00:08,250
Hey, is anyone out there hearing this?

2492
03:00:08,250 --> 03:00:09,450
Hit Luigi if you don't work.

2493
03:00:14,590 --> 03:00:15,790
Shit, we got him.

2494
03:00:18,700 --> 03:00:20,600
Um, coordinates.

2495
03:00:21,319 --> 03:00:22,680
Oh, you're the one doing this.

2496
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:23,479
I see.

2497
03:00:23,479 --> 03:00:26,280
And I thought this was just an uninteracted cut scene.

2498
03:00:27,319 --> 03:00:29,159
12 degrees, 30 minutes south.

2499
03:00:29,159 --> 03:00:31,879
151 degrees, 20 minutes west.

2500
03:00:31,879 --> 03:00:32,680
How do you know all that?

2501
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:33,399
Please get here now.

2502
03:00:33,399 --> 03:00:34,600
We need help.

2503
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:36,360
Wouldn't the captain know that better?

2504
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:36,860
Yeah.

2505
03:00:37,659 --> 03:00:40,930
Please repeat.

2506
03:00:40,930 --> 03:00:45,090
Are you sure you're not reading the back of the Tyson chicken nuggets?

2507
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:55,379
You gotta let your finger off the button for them to talk back.

2508
03:00:56,260 --> 03:00:59,940
150 degrees for 20 minutes.

2509
03:01:01,729 --> 03:01:02,229
Roger.

2510
03:01:04,399 --> 03:01:05,680
Yo, guys.

2511
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,360
They heard it was an emergency so they're like,

2512
03:01:10,100 --> 03:01:12,180
they're gonna come and be new pirates.

2513
03:01:12,819 --> 03:01:14,979
You invited the new antagonist to come find us.

2514
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:17,819
Why did I panic?

2515
03:01:18,540 --> 03:01:21,579
Because I tried the calm approach

2516
03:01:21,659 --> 03:01:23,739
and they didn't listen to me so then I decided to scream.

2517
03:01:23,739 --> 03:01:25,020
You need to get that radio working.

2518
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:26,059
I think someone should wait here.

2519
03:01:26,059 --> 03:01:28,059
It's gonna be like a second gang of pirates.

2520
03:01:28,059 --> 03:01:29,260
I gotta be honest.

2521
03:01:29,260 --> 03:01:31,420
I don't think I'm gonna make it down there in my shape.

2522
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:31,979
I'll go.

2523
03:01:31,979 --> 03:01:33,020
150 degrees.

2524
03:01:33,020 --> 03:01:33,819
What's wrong with him?

2525
03:01:33,819 --> 03:01:35,899
I should be the one to go.

2526
03:01:35,899 --> 03:01:38,219
He got punched in the face like three hours ago.

2527
03:01:38,219 --> 03:01:38,719
Come on.

2528
03:01:39,659 --> 03:01:41,739
Sounds like you're scared of someone stepping out of your shadow.

2529
03:01:41,739 --> 03:01:43,979
Scared of my idiot brother getting himself killed?

2530
03:01:43,979 --> 03:01:45,819
How about showing me some brotherly love?

2531
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:50,239
All right.

2532
03:01:50,239 --> 03:01:52,000
Hey, if you're sure you're up for it,

2533
03:01:52,639 --> 03:01:53,600
I believe you got it, bro.

2534
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:55,250
I'm coming, too.

2535
03:01:55,250 --> 03:01:55,969
Hey, wait.

2536
03:01:55,969 --> 03:01:57,409
No, don't send him.

2537
03:01:57,409 --> 03:01:58,450
No, my bodyguard.

2538
03:01:58,450 --> 03:01:59,409
I can take care of myself.

2539
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:09,920
Whoa, whoa.

2540
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:12,299
If Julia says she can handle it,

2541
03:02:12,940 --> 03:02:13,819
she can handle it.

2542
03:02:15,059 --> 03:02:15,780
Case closed.

2543
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:17,139
Okay, Julia.

2544
03:02:19,059 --> 03:02:19,559
Wait.

2545
03:02:21,139 --> 03:02:21,940
That team's dead.

2546
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:30,340
I can't.

2547
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:42,639
The two worst people.

2548
03:02:42,639 --> 03:02:44,639
It's like Star Wars trash compactor.

2549
03:02:44,639 --> 03:02:45,139
Shoot.

2550
03:02:45,780 --> 03:02:47,139
That's so fucking funny.

2551
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:51,700
Immediately, the two potential worst people do this.

2552
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:52,979
You guys can handle it?

2553
03:02:52,979 --> 03:02:54,500
The two weaklings.

2554
03:02:54,500 --> 03:02:55,940
We're like, can I go, please, mommy?

2555
03:02:55,940 --> 03:02:56,739
You doing okay?

2556
03:02:56,739 --> 03:02:57,219
Yeah, sure.

2557
03:02:57,219 --> 03:02:58,340
If you think you can handle it.

2558
03:03:00,659 --> 03:03:01,379
Immediately.

2559
03:03:01,379 --> 03:03:01,879
We're okay.

2560
03:03:02,899 --> 03:03:07,409
What are we going to do?

2561
03:03:07,409 --> 03:03:11,649
It's going to be a miracle if we can actually have everybody live.

2562
03:03:11,649 --> 03:03:12,209
We've got to find out where we are.

2563
03:03:12,209 --> 03:03:13,889
Okay.

2564
03:03:13,889 --> 03:03:15,329
We'll wait here by the radio.

2565
03:03:15,329 --> 03:03:17,409
Oh, I didn't realize that I have to be these two.

2566
03:03:18,049 --> 03:03:18,549
Here.

2567
03:03:19,299 --> 03:03:21,780
Dude, this is just the broken clock is right twice a day.

2568
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:23,379
Somehow we ended up saving all five.

2569
03:03:25,159 --> 03:03:25,959
It ain't over yet.

2570
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:29,559
There's going to be a spectacular like death parade at the end.

2571
03:03:29,559 --> 03:03:30,059
Hey.

2572
03:03:34,629 --> 03:03:35,270
With clowns.

2573
03:03:35,909 --> 03:03:38,569
After you.

2574
03:03:39,270 --> 03:03:41,670
Okay, here we go.

2575
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:42,229
Is this us?

2576
03:03:43,430 --> 03:03:43,930
Yeah.

2577
03:03:44,309 --> 03:03:44,809
I'm Brad.

2578
03:03:45,430 --> 03:03:45,989
Are you?

2579
03:03:45,989 --> 03:03:46,950
Hey, am I though?

2580
03:03:48,069 --> 03:03:48,629
Might not be.

2581
03:03:50,879 --> 03:03:52,690
Guessing these are the lower level.

2582
03:03:52,690 --> 03:03:53,969
No, I'm just fucking around.

2583
03:03:53,969 --> 03:03:54,690
I'm actually upstairs.

2584
03:03:56,290 --> 03:03:56,790
No, you're not.

2585
03:03:57,409 --> 03:03:58,450
Yes, I am.

2586
03:03:58,450 --> 03:04:02,770
Don't lie to me.

2587
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:03,409
I'm upstairs.

2588
03:04:03,409 --> 03:04:05,010
We were trying to get the radio to work again.

2589
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:14,559
The frequencies are so stupid.

2590
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:38,930
We should probably mute you.

2591
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:42,870
I wish I could actually, you know, enjoy this.

2592
03:04:42,870 --> 03:04:44,709
What the hell are you talking about?

2593
03:04:44,709 --> 03:04:45,750
I think I think he thinks.

2594
03:04:46,389 --> 03:04:50,950
In any other circumstance, you know, this place would be the coolest place to explore.

2595
03:04:50,950 --> 03:04:52,069
Like, like ever.

2596
03:04:52,069 --> 03:04:53,670
I'm going to say no, not at all.

2597
03:04:53,670 --> 03:04:56,079
Says the girl on the way to die of a wreck.

2598
03:04:56,959 --> 03:04:58,319
Well, he's muted right now.

2599
03:04:58,319 --> 03:05:00,239
I think he think he muted first, not me.

2600
03:05:04,659 --> 03:05:05,940
He muted first.

2601
03:05:05,940 --> 03:05:14,469
I have to be a really, really good NPC here.

2602
03:05:47,620 --> 03:06:05,409
Wait, are you reverse pranking me right now?

2603
03:06:05,409 --> 03:06:06,370
I'm just curious.

2604
03:06:06,370 --> 03:06:10,180
How so?

2605
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:15,879
Are you like reverse pranking me?

2606
03:06:15,879 --> 03:06:16,379
Reverse?

2607
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:18,100
Yes.

2608
03:06:18,399 --> 03:06:20,559
You're up there doing the radio stuff, right?

2609
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:24,690
Yeah, what are you doing down here?

2610
03:06:24,690 --> 03:06:25,170
Down here?

2611
03:06:26,049 --> 03:06:26,930
There's three different groups.

2612
03:06:28,719 --> 03:06:29,920
Oh shit, I blew it.

2613
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:31,280
What are you doing down here?

2614
03:06:34,770 --> 03:06:38,920
Oh shit.

2615
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:40,500
Oh, I knew from the beginning.

2616
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:41,219
Oh, he knew.

2617
03:06:41,219 --> 03:06:41,860
He doesn't know.

2618
03:06:42,340 --> 03:06:48,399
All right, so what the hell are we supposed to be doing here?

2619
03:06:51,430 --> 03:06:52,870
Are you reverse pranking?

2620
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:57,270
Would you think I was an NPC for a second just because I was holding the light?

2621
03:06:57,270 --> 03:06:58,229
Ten days in the brick.

2622
03:06:58,229 --> 03:07:01,670
No, I thought that you were pretending to be an NPC too.

2623
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:04,229
And then I was going to freak out and be like, wait, is he actually down here?

2624
03:07:04,870 --> 03:07:06,479
Pretty good, pretty good attempt.

2625
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:07,760
Ten days approved.

2626
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:08,239
All right, let's see.

2627
03:07:08,959 --> 03:07:11,959
Engaging with the soldier in a drunken argument.

2628
03:07:23,010 --> 03:07:24,770
Every one of these hallways looks exactly the same.

2629
03:07:25,489 --> 03:07:36,420
The amount of times that I have Warcraft keyboard turned down a hallway

2630
03:07:37,219 --> 03:07:39,700
is probably like two hours of this game so far.

2631
03:07:40,340 --> 03:07:53,040
Now, where did you go?

2632
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:59,600
Here, come check this out.

2633
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:00,319
I just pulled him.

2634
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:02,479
I got yoinked.

2635
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:04,719
I just yoinked him.

2636
03:08:05,360 --> 03:08:07,799
Looks like the engine room.

2637
03:08:07,799 --> 03:08:09,319
Good place to find the generator, right?

2638
03:08:09,959 --> 03:08:16,309
Are you breath?

2639
03:08:16,309 --> 03:08:17,350
The ladder's broken off here.

2640
03:08:19,399 --> 03:08:21,159
I think I can just wait.

2641
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:24,200
Oh, that would hurt so bad.

2642
03:08:25,159 --> 03:08:28,389
Yeah, just come down.

2643
03:08:28,389 --> 03:08:29,829
That's a back problem for the rest of your life.

2644
03:08:30,469 --> 03:08:33,940
You should have seen what happened to him earlier.

2645
03:08:34,979 --> 03:08:37,110
This is hurting me, just watching it.

2646
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:38,790
He's fallen three times.

2647
03:08:38,790 --> 03:08:41,920
And what's the other guy's name?

2648
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:42,559
Oh, God.

2649
03:08:42,559 --> 03:08:43,040
What's up?

2650
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:44,959
That, it was, it was, it was.

2651
03:08:44,959 --> 03:08:46,479
Oh, not this shit again.

2652
03:08:46,479 --> 03:08:47,040
Did you see it?

2653
03:08:48,639 --> 03:08:49,280
Hello?

2654
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:50,719
Isn't this just the same trick?

2655
03:08:50,719 --> 03:08:52,399
This is the same thing.

2656
03:08:52,399 --> 03:08:53,440
You're not.

2657
03:08:53,440 --> 03:08:54,399
It's the same thing.

2658
03:08:54,959 --> 03:08:56,079
Follow my thinking here.

2659
03:08:56,079 --> 03:08:58,639
We know this ship was carrying manchurian gold,

2660
03:08:58,639 --> 03:09:01,600
which was actually some kind of dangerous chemical, right?

2661
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:03,920
And there's just like weird fog everywhere.

2662
03:09:04,239 --> 03:09:05,760
This is not a 12-hour game.

2663
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:07,680
This happened twice in the last three hours.

2664
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:07,920
Yeah.

2665
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:10,639
Maybe it's fucking us all up, like in the head, you know?

2666
03:09:10,639 --> 03:09:13,280
I mean, I definitely saw some crazy shit

2667
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:16,319
that I could have sworn was real, but maybe it wasn't.

2668
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:18,559
We know the crew were scared shitless of something.

2669
03:09:18,559 --> 03:09:19,280
None of it happened.

2670
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:21,280
None of it was real.

2671
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:23,520
It was just a hallucination.

2672
03:09:24,079 --> 03:09:27,030
This couldn't have anything to do with the plane wreck we dived.

2673
03:09:28,149 --> 03:09:29,829
I mean, maybe there was a connection.

2674
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:31,989
Maybe they made contact.

2675
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:34,149
It's a theory, I guess.

2676
03:09:34,950 --> 03:09:35,829
Oh, God.

2677
03:09:35,829 --> 03:09:37,909
The thing we sent the guy with glasses down here,

2678
03:09:37,909 --> 03:09:39,270
we never would have figured this out.

2679
03:09:39,270 --> 03:09:39,670
Yeah, I know.

2680
03:09:40,790 --> 03:09:49,459
All right.

2681
03:09:49,459 --> 03:09:50,020
What does this say?

2682
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:53,159
Netherlands.

2683
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:59,639
Diesel engine number 1734, year 1920, type L87CSE.

2684
03:10:00,360 --> 03:10:02,280
Okay, cool.

2685
03:10:03,159 --> 03:10:18,260
I can't believe we are absolutely encroaching

2686
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:20,100
on like the last arc of the game.

2687
03:10:20,819 --> 03:10:22,159
We have to be, right?

2688
03:10:22,159 --> 03:10:23,840
This is only like a four to five-hour game, right?

2689
03:10:24,399 --> 03:10:26,870
Uh-huh.

2690
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:27,750
And they've already figured out

2691
03:10:27,750 --> 03:10:29,270
they just talked about the trick.

2692
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:29,590
Yeah.

2693
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:31,110
They just, there's gotta be like,

2694
03:10:31,110 --> 03:10:32,469
there's gotta be a gotcha moment

2695
03:10:32,469 --> 03:10:33,750
where you thought you had it figured out.

2696
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:40,659
But then, hold on.

2697
03:10:40,659 --> 03:10:42,309
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

2698
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:50,819
Should I pull this out?

2699
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:53,620
Hey, hey, I found it.

2700
03:10:53,620 --> 03:10:54,420
I think I just told them.

2701
03:10:54,420 --> 03:10:55,780
Stop finding all this stuff.

2702
03:10:55,780 --> 03:10:56,500
And it's working.

2703
03:10:58,040 --> 03:10:59,479
I'm trying to find stuff, too.

2704
03:10:59,479 --> 03:11:00,520
Yeah, this is it, all right.

2705
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:01,159
But over there.

2706
03:11:01,159 --> 03:11:03,000
Just throw the switch and let's get back upstairs.

2707
03:11:05,489 --> 03:11:06,850
That's so ridiculous.

2708
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:07,889
You're over there exploring

2709
03:11:07,889 --> 03:11:09,649
and whoever just finds the thing first

2710
03:11:10,610 --> 03:11:11,969
just sucks the person over.

2711
03:11:13,750 --> 03:11:16,639
Oh, wow.

2712
03:11:16,639 --> 03:11:17,200
What?

2713
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:17,780
What do you mean?

2714
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:18,340
What's the hold up?

2715
03:11:18,340 --> 03:11:20,340
You failed the QTE, so they let me do it.

2716
03:11:20,340 --> 03:11:21,219
I just did it.

2717
03:11:24,879 --> 03:11:26,399
That's why you had to call me over

2718
03:11:26,399 --> 03:11:28,239
because, you know, you're very book smart.

2719
03:11:28,239 --> 03:11:30,959
But when it comes to practically using your hands,

2720
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:32,159
you need some help.

2721
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:37,350
I did it.

2722
03:11:37,350 --> 03:11:38,790
And then you stepped in and did it again.

2723
03:11:39,350 --> 03:11:40,389
Mom, it's my turn.

2724
03:11:40,389 --> 03:11:41,670
I'm super Nintendo.

2725
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:44,069
There are things on the ship that are trying to hurt us.

2726
03:11:44,069 --> 03:11:44,569
Over.

2727
03:11:50,799 --> 03:11:51,520
It's not real.

2728
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:53,760
We think the name of it is the Iran Medan.

2729
03:11:55,090 --> 03:11:55,409
Really?

2730
03:11:55,409 --> 03:11:56,290
The Iran Medan?

2731
03:11:57,090 --> 03:11:58,209
Why was there no subtitles there?

2732
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:09,239
What did he say?

2733
03:12:09,239 --> 03:12:10,200
The Iran Medan?

2734
03:12:11,639 --> 03:12:12,840
The Duran Duran?

2735
03:12:12,840 --> 03:12:13,879
What was the name of the boat?

2736
03:12:13,879 --> 03:12:15,000
What was what's this called?

2737
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:15,719
Iran Medan.

2738
03:12:17,079 --> 03:12:27,799
Look at this.

2739
03:12:27,799 --> 03:12:30,520
Hey, come on over.

2740
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:34,399
The fisherman must have bothered over from the Duke of Milan.

2741
03:12:34,959 --> 03:12:36,479
You think it still works?

2742
03:12:36,479 --> 03:12:38,159
Looks like it's got a little juice left.

2743
03:12:38,159 --> 03:12:39,040
Maybe a couple of minutes.

2744
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:40,559
Should we bring it with us?

2745
03:12:40,559 --> 03:12:41,280
I mean, it's heavy.

2746
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,280
What is it?

2747
03:12:44,360 --> 03:12:44,680
Hang on.

2748
03:12:44,680 --> 03:12:45,239
No, seriously.

2749
03:12:45,239 --> 03:12:45,959
What is it?

2750
03:12:45,959 --> 03:12:49,879
Uh, it's the Ghostbusters proton pack thing to dive with.

2751
03:12:51,170 --> 03:12:52,530
Scuba gear stuff.

2752
03:13:01,440 --> 03:13:02,479
Those guys aren't even real.

2753
03:13:08,159 --> 03:13:12,979
Actually, they have to be because we have a shared hallucination yet.

2754
03:13:15,989 --> 03:13:16,629
Yeah, I don't know.

2755
03:13:26,049 --> 03:13:26,770
He can't hear you.

2756
03:13:26,770 --> 03:13:28,370
He's not awake.

2757
03:13:29,329 --> 03:13:32,639
Yeah, but he's hallucinating.

2758
03:13:34,639 --> 03:13:35,680
He's hallucinating.

2759
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:51,940
Rip right side, look right into the camera because he sees us.

2760
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:03,540
So have we not concluded that the hallucinations are a result of this

2761
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:07,059
strange miasmic gas that has been pouring into the boat since we got on it?

2762
03:14:07,059 --> 03:14:08,340
I mean, yeah, that's what it is.

2763
03:14:14,610 --> 03:14:18,629
Oh, oh, oh, he can hear heartbeats.

2764
03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:30,389
How do you not turn around?

2765
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:35,440
All right, all your Super Mario RPG practice should have prepared you for that.

2766
03:14:37,280 --> 03:14:44,879
Oh, he's going to get up.

2767
03:14:45,440 --> 03:14:46,399
Don't breathe in the gas.

2768
03:14:46,399 --> 03:14:46,959
Hold your breath.

2769
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:49,299
Hold your breath.

2770
03:14:49,860 --> 03:14:54,739
Wait, am I?

2771
03:14:56,659 --> 03:14:58,819
I'm like seeing that's not there.

2772
03:15:02,180 --> 03:15:03,620
Yeah, here comes hallucination.

2773
03:15:15,670 --> 03:15:15,989
I know.

2774
03:15:16,629 --> 03:15:17,350
No, we don't.

2775
03:15:21,159 --> 03:15:22,680
Are we going to do a mute scenario?

2776
03:15:23,889 --> 03:15:24,770
Incoming mute.

2777
03:15:27,750 --> 03:15:30,309
What did you pick?

2778
03:15:30,309 --> 03:15:30,629
Nothing.

2779
03:15:30,629 --> 03:15:31,350
It was you.

2780
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:31,750
You was on.

2781
03:15:31,750 --> 03:15:32,389
That was your pick.

2782
03:15:33,860 --> 03:15:34,260
What did I?

2783
03:15:35,059 --> 03:15:37,010
What was important about his hand?

2784
03:15:38,610 --> 03:15:41,760
I don't know.

2785
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:42,719
Maybe he had something in it.

2786
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:45,879
We didn't get the cap.

2787
03:15:45,879 --> 03:15:46,680
Did we get the cap?

2788
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:47,399
No, he has it.

2789
03:15:57,479 --> 03:15:58,840
Is this the same voice actor?

2790
03:16:01,379 --> 03:16:02,579
Maybe they changed to...

2791
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:05,409
Did they Dario this guy?

2792
03:16:06,690 --> 03:16:08,899
Again?

2793
03:16:08,899 --> 03:16:10,579
Again, the comm meter.

2794
03:16:25,379 --> 03:16:27,059
He set the title of my stream.

2795
03:16:27,059 --> 03:16:28,739
He said the title of my stream.

2796
03:16:28,739 --> 03:16:29,219
I'm sorry.

2797
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:34,899
I did not know that.

2798
03:16:34,899 --> 03:16:36,260
He said the title of my fucking stream.

2799
03:16:36,260 --> 03:16:36,979
That freaked me out.

2800
03:16:36,979 --> 03:16:37,379
I'm sorry.

2801
03:16:49,270 --> 03:16:51,350
That's the title of my fucking live stream.

2802
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:20,850
I got so hyped up over that.

2803
03:17:22,209 --> 03:17:23,889
Didn't this guy get drowned earlier?

2804
03:17:25,170 --> 03:17:25,729
I don't know.

2805
03:17:25,729 --> 03:17:25,969
What?

2806
03:17:26,690 --> 03:17:27,969
Okay.

2807
03:17:27,969 --> 03:17:30,559
How many pirates are there?

2808
03:17:30,559 --> 03:17:31,680
What do you mean drowned twice?

2809
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:40,040
I may as well have got up from the seat

2810
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:41,239
and like spun around walking.

2811
03:17:41,239 --> 03:17:42,680
He said the title of my stream.

2812
03:17:47,090 --> 03:17:47,729
Please.

2813
03:17:47,729 --> 03:17:49,569
We've got no problem with you.

2814
03:17:49,569 --> 03:17:50,850
We just want to get out of here.

2815
03:17:51,969 --> 03:17:52,370
Please.

2816
03:17:53,489 --> 03:17:54,370
I'm sorry.

2817
03:17:54,370 --> 03:17:55,809
But if you're breathing,

2818
03:17:56,370 --> 03:17:58,610
then you don't get much of a choice in the matter.

2819
03:17:58,850 --> 03:18:00,370
Oh, they're taking my choice away.

2820
03:18:03,809 --> 03:18:04,770
Not again.

2821
03:18:04,770 --> 03:18:06,739
I'm changing on me.

2822
03:18:06,739 --> 03:18:08,069
What?

2823
03:18:08,069 --> 03:18:08,870
What's changing?

2824
03:18:09,510 --> 03:18:10,069
Stay away.

2825
03:18:11,329 --> 03:18:12,450
Stay back from the mist.

2826
03:18:13,170 --> 03:18:13,409
What?

2827
03:18:14,049 --> 03:18:15,010
There's no mist, man.

2828
03:18:15,809 --> 03:18:16,450
Don't breathe it.

2829
03:18:16,450 --> 03:18:17,489
There's the guy.

2830
03:18:17,489 --> 03:18:18,290
Don't breathe the mist.

2831
03:18:18,290 --> 03:18:18,770
The guy.

2832
03:18:20,049 --> 03:18:20,690
Did you see him?

2833
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:21,329
Don't breathe it.

2834
03:18:22,209 --> 03:18:23,399
What man?

2835
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:29,350
The guy from the book's shelf was in the background.

2836
03:18:29,350 --> 03:18:30,309
Why can't we breathe the mist?

2837
03:18:30,950 --> 03:18:31,750
What does it do?

2838
03:18:32,629 --> 03:18:33,680
He was in the mist.

2839
03:18:34,319 --> 03:18:34,559
Life.

2840
03:18:35,760 --> 03:18:38,319
Bringing things to life that shouldn't be alive.

2841
03:18:39,280 --> 03:18:40,629
It's inside now.

2842
03:18:41,969 --> 03:18:43,489
Inside with us now.

2843
03:18:44,690 --> 03:18:46,209
Please just calm down.

2844
03:18:46,209 --> 03:18:46,530
Stop.

2845
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:48,079
Stop.

2846
03:18:48,959 --> 03:18:51,620
It's in one of us, isn't it?

2847
03:18:52,420 --> 03:18:55,000
Got to have to tell him like he has the flashlight

2848
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:56,040
and I have the gun so we have to trade.

2849
03:18:56,680 --> 03:18:58,629
You're holding a flashlight, man.

2850
03:18:58,629 --> 03:18:59,190
I'm holding the gun.

2851
03:18:59,190 --> 03:18:59,590
Let's trade.

2852
03:18:59,590 --> 03:19:00,870
Put the gun down.

2853
03:19:00,870 --> 03:19:01,430
Now.

2854
03:19:01,430 --> 03:19:02,870
I wish you said it.

2855
03:19:04,389 --> 03:19:05,590
Why are you telling me what to do?

2856
03:19:06,149 --> 03:19:07,430
Yeah, you were in the mist.

2857
03:19:08,229 --> 03:19:08,950
It's happening.

2858
03:19:10,659 --> 03:19:11,700
Well, I guess we're dead.

2859
03:19:13,459 --> 03:19:13,780
Wait.

2860
03:19:18,469 --> 03:19:19,510
Hey, all right.

2861
03:19:19,510 --> 03:19:21,829
Look, there was something back there.

2862
03:19:22,469 --> 03:19:23,750
Maybe a mist or fog.

2863
03:19:23,750 --> 03:19:24,069
Maybe.

2864
03:19:25,350 --> 03:19:29,510
Did you just admit to breathing the mist?

2865
03:19:29,510 --> 03:19:30,790
That's the guy with the gun.

2866
03:19:35,059 --> 03:19:37,379
No, look, we held our breath.

2867
03:19:37,379 --> 03:19:39,059
We did not breathe any of that stuff.

2868
03:19:39,059 --> 03:19:45,489
Oh, fancy divers.

2869
03:19:45,489 --> 03:19:47,010
But you expect me to buy that?

2870
03:19:48,690 --> 03:19:50,760
We've been for hours.

2871
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:52,600
That's actually a great argument with divers.

2872
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:53,559
You've been holding your breath this whole time.

2873
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:55,799
You're holding your breath right now.

2874
03:19:55,799 --> 03:20:01,860
The mist in me don't die.

2875
03:20:01,860 --> 03:20:02,180
See?

2876
03:20:02,180 --> 03:20:02,899
I freaked him out.

2877
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:04,979
I freaked him out.

2878
03:20:06,530 --> 03:20:07,809
So I got some bad news for you.

2879
03:20:07,809 --> 03:20:18,309
I can feel it swirling around gently inside.

2880
03:20:18,309 --> 03:20:18,809
Wait, what?

2881
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,959
Wait, what if that's one of us?

2882
03:20:20,959 --> 03:20:23,040
And what if we breathe the mist and that's one of us?

2883
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:24,159
No, let him do it.

2884
03:20:24,159 --> 03:20:24,799
What are you talking about?

2885
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:26,000
Just let him do it.

2886
03:20:26,639 --> 03:20:27,680
I wouldn't even let him do it.

2887
03:20:28,239 --> 03:20:28,799
There is no...

2888
03:20:28,799 --> 03:20:31,139
No, no, I can't see it.

2889
03:20:31,139 --> 03:20:31,620
You're all right.

2890
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:32,840
There's no mist.

2891
03:20:33,479 --> 03:20:36,229
Stop lying.

2892
03:20:36,229 --> 03:20:41,280
I don't see it in me, can't you?

2893
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:43,940
You're all just lying.

2894
03:20:44,579 --> 03:20:46,100
The mist is inside.

2895
03:20:46,659 --> 03:20:54,629
Where's the flashlight?

2896
03:20:54,629 --> 03:20:55,829
The flashlight was hovering.

2897
03:20:56,549 --> 03:20:57,590
Hey, man, come on.

2898
03:20:57,590 --> 03:20:57,989
Just put...

2899
03:20:59,270 --> 03:21:02,069
All right, now the premonition has been fulfilled.

2900
03:21:02,629 --> 03:21:03,829
Fucking shit.

2901
03:21:03,829 --> 03:21:04,389
We're fine.

2902
03:21:05,190 --> 03:21:07,190
I saw him kill himself like an hour ago.

2903
03:21:07,190 --> 03:21:08,069
You did?

2904
03:21:08,069 --> 03:21:08,790
In a premonition.

2905
03:21:08,790 --> 03:21:09,270
But where...

2906
03:21:10,069 --> 03:21:19,459
I honestly don't know if there was another outcome for that because

2907
03:21:23,909 --> 03:21:25,989
he's been dead for centuries.

2908
03:21:27,030 --> 03:21:29,079
Hey, we got a gun.

2909
03:21:29,719 --> 03:21:32,760
No, we don't because this is two people that don't want guns.

2910
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:33,479
Oh.

2911
03:21:33,479 --> 03:21:34,280
So we threw it back.

2912
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:35,559
Well, so what?

2913
03:21:40,040 --> 03:21:42,760
Maybe if you sent down the wrong two people, he would have killed them.

2914
03:21:43,639 --> 03:21:46,040
We sent the two least threatening people in the crew.

2915
03:21:46,600 --> 03:21:47,319
I don't know.

2916
03:21:47,319 --> 03:21:51,479
Wait by the radio.

2917
03:21:51,479 --> 03:21:52,040
Why?

2918
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:53,559
I'm going to check the next level.

2919
03:21:53,559 --> 03:21:55,399
There might be some more gear down there we can use.

2920
03:21:55,399 --> 03:21:55,959
Uh...

2921
03:21:56,040 --> 03:21:58,959
Just wait by the radio.

2922
03:21:59,680 --> 03:22:01,459
I'm going to hang back here as well.

2923
03:22:03,590 --> 03:22:04,870
See, I thought they were pulling like a...

2924
03:22:05,670 --> 03:22:07,750
You breathe the mist and like was that one of us?

2925
03:22:07,750 --> 03:22:09,829
And like he was back at the wall with the flashlight.

2926
03:22:10,469 --> 03:22:10,870
Nobody's good.

2927
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:13,030
I don't think we can because there's no...

2928
03:22:13,030 --> 03:22:15,989
The only times we've hallucinated, we've been by ourselves.

2929
03:22:15,989 --> 03:22:17,270
Like Alex right here.

2930
03:22:17,909 --> 03:22:20,069
So Alex is going to be hallucinating.

2931
03:22:20,069 --> 03:22:22,870
Why can't people fucking just slowly go down a hole?

2932
03:22:23,909 --> 03:22:25,559
Don't say the name of my stream again.

2933
03:22:25,559 --> 03:22:26,200
He's invisible.

2934
03:22:27,079 --> 03:22:27,959
He's invisible.

2935
03:22:29,540 --> 03:22:30,739
How did he not see that?

2936
03:22:31,059 --> 03:22:32,579
He's like a splinter cell enemy.

2937
03:22:47,809 --> 03:22:48,610
Oh, he's left eye.

2938
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:49,090
He's blind.

2939
03:22:49,090 --> 03:22:50,770
He just didn't turn left at all.

2940
03:23:02,559 --> 03:23:03,440
Who's in the background?

2941
03:23:04,260 --> 03:23:05,379
The guy that's watching us.

2942
03:23:06,739 --> 03:23:09,989
All right.

2943
03:23:09,989 --> 03:23:10,709
Um, so you're...

2944
03:23:11,510 --> 03:23:12,229
I am Alex.

2945
03:23:12,229 --> 03:23:13,430
You are Phyllis, right?

2946
03:23:14,629 --> 03:23:16,440
I'm down there with Julia.

2947
03:23:17,639 --> 03:23:18,120
So you're in...

2948
03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:19,000
Wait, you're not Phyllis.

2949
03:23:19,879 --> 03:23:22,450
It's Phyllis, the captain?

2950
03:23:22,450 --> 03:23:22,690
Yes.

2951
03:23:30,129 --> 03:23:30,450
All right.

2952
03:23:30,450 --> 03:23:33,090
I am breathing mist in my own fucking room here.

2953
03:23:33,090 --> 03:23:33,969
What's happening?

2954
03:23:33,969 --> 03:23:34,450
Who are you?

2955
03:23:35,170 --> 03:23:37,620
I'm breathing mist into my own fucking office.

2956
03:23:37,620 --> 03:23:38,500
You're breathing mist?

2957
03:23:52,530 --> 03:23:54,290
Is the mist coming in through the air conditioning?

2958
03:23:58,870 --> 03:23:59,510
In the office?

2959
03:24:08,100 --> 03:24:09,139
It's vape juice.

2960
03:24:18,370 --> 03:24:19,170
Vape juice.

2961
03:24:19,969 --> 03:24:20,450
Uh-oh.

2962
03:24:20,450 --> 03:24:21,090
There he is.

2963
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:31,799
The sledgehammer, boss.

2964
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:38,600
Oh, no.

2965
03:24:39,559 --> 03:24:40,440
Oh, my God.

2966
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:42,360
I was looking at my fucking phone.

2967
03:24:42,360 --> 03:24:44,040
Oh, why was I doing that?

2968
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:44,760
That was stupid.

2969
03:24:45,799 --> 03:24:46,120
I'm fine.

2970
03:24:46,120 --> 03:24:46,520
It's okay.

2971
03:24:46,520 --> 03:24:47,639
You weren't meant to die there.

2972
03:24:49,940 --> 03:24:50,659
Holy fuck.

2973
03:24:50,659 --> 03:24:52,100
I looked at my phone again.

2974
03:24:53,829 --> 03:24:54,549
Holy shit.

2975
03:25:04,319 --> 03:25:05,040
More mist.

2976
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:13,700
So when you said that they were transporting drugs earlier,

2977
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:14,659
you might have been right.

2978
03:25:15,459 --> 03:25:16,709
Was I right?

2979
03:25:16,709 --> 03:25:17,430
The mist drug.

2980
03:25:18,149 --> 03:25:28,000
That's going to be revealed to be some kind of crazy advanced biochemical warfare.

2981
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:29,760
That's the allies we're going to use.

2982
03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:33,200
The mist just came out of it.

2983
03:25:33,200 --> 03:25:37,600
The 1940s American military was going to use these weapons of biochemical war.

2984
03:25:38,399 --> 03:25:53,569
Where'd you?

2985
03:25:54,129 --> 03:25:56,659
All right.

2986
03:25:56,659 --> 03:25:57,139
We have to mute.

2987
03:25:58,020 --> 03:25:58,420
Mute.

2988
03:25:58,420 --> 03:25:58,739
Mute.

2989
03:25:59,379 --> 03:26:07,440
What the fuck?

2990
03:26:08,079 --> 03:26:19,360
Is that me?

2991
03:26:19,360 --> 03:26:40,879
Oh, this is the laundry room.

2992
03:26:49,170 --> 03:26:49,649
Dead guy.

2993
03:26:50,370 --> 03:26:57,299
Of course.

2994
03:26:58,020 --> 03:27:00,600
They will restrict you a moment around the plants

2995
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:02,120
to prove difficult to look for Jones.

2996
03:27:02,200 --> 03:27:03,399
Your primary objective is clear,

2997
03:27:03,399 --> 03:27:05,319
but your secondary objective is when you reach your destination

2998
03:27:05,319 --> 03:27:08,520
is to locate Jones and his men and get them back on home.

2999
03:27:08,520 --> 03:27:09,319
I'm going to sit online.

3000
03:27:09,879 --> 03:27:12,680
You must be vigilant and be very concerned with your personal safety.

3001
03:27:14,049 --> 03:27:15,250
You got another one.

3002
03:27:15,250 --> 03:27:15,569
Okay.

3003
03:27:16,370 --> 03:27:19,670
They've been captured.

3004
03:27:19,670 --> 03:27:20,309
They're still alive.

3005
03:27:20,309 --> 03:27:23,430
Only that their last notification was approaching the plant and they were silent.

3006
03:27:23,430 --> 03:27:24,469
The plant is high security.

3007
03:27:24,469 --> 03:27:25,190
They're expecting you.

3008
03:27:26,149 --> 03:27:28,530
Sergeant Jones and five of his platoon have been missing

3009
03:27:28,530 --> 03:27:30,930
during a reconnaissance mission at the water purification plant.

3010
03:27:31,489 --> 03:27:33,010
Water purification plant.

3011
03:27:33,969 --> 03:27:36,520
So they're putting something in the water.

3012
03:27:37,319 --> 03:27:41,010
The mist was supposed to the best is that I get it.

3013
03:27:55,250 --> 03:27:56,370
I don't think he gets it.

3014
03:27:57,010 --> 03:27:57,569
Now I get it.

3015
03:27:58,129 --> 03:28:09,239
The thing is, where did the talics go?

3016
03:28:09,799 --> 03:28:16,079
Nothing else over here.

3017
03:28:16,719 --> 03:28:21,170
And we can't go back.

3018
03:28:21,170 --> 03:28:21,969
I can't go back that way.

3019
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:29,729
Explain the whole plot to me.

3020
03:28:29,729 --> 03:28:29,969
Okay.

3021
03:28:33,940 --> 03:28:34,659
What the fuck?

3022
03:28:34,659 --> 03:28:35,620
Who are you?

3023
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:49,590
That's what the hell I'm supposed to do.

3024
03:28:49,590 --> 03:28:58,159
Is there a hallway I can go down?

3025
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:06,799
Yeah.

3026
03:29:06,799 --> 03:29:08,319
I'm like, how am I lost?

3027
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:10,000
This is like the only.

3028
03:29:10,879 --> 03:29:12,159
I can't let go.

3029
03:29:12,159 --> 03:29:12,659
Fliss.

3030
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:14,000
You okay?

3031
03:29:20,389 --> 03:29:25,170
I'm in different clothes.

3032
03:29:26,049 --> 03:29:27,799
What the fuck is going on?

3033
03:29:30,680 --> 03:29:44,950
What the hell happened?

3034
03:29:48,870 --> 03:29:50,149
The rats are going to get me.

3035
03:29:51,030 --> 03:29:54,579
They're not real.

3036
03:29:54,579 --> 03:29:55,540
The rats aren't real.

3037
03:29:55,540 --> 03:29:56,040
Let's get out.

3038
03:29:59,620 --> 03:30:00,899
What the fuck is going on?

3039
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:02,819
Is that a talics?

3040
03:30:03,540 --> 03:30:10,979
Should I have said that?

3041
03:30:24,760 --> 03:30:26,159
I don't die.

3042
03:30:26,159 --> 03:30:27,120
I can't communicate.

3043
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:29,510
I can't communicate.

3044
03:30:30,469 --> 03:30:33,750
What did you do to me?

3045
03:30:35,680 --> 03:30:36,399
What did you do to me?

3046
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:38,959
What the fuck?

3047
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:41,760
Why did.

3048
03:30:42,799 --> 03:30:44,549
Who's doing that?

3049
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:54,719
Why did that happen to me?

3050
03:30:57,000 --> 03:30:57,799
What?

3051
03:30:57,799 --> 03:30:58,440
Kill the rat.

3052
03:31:00,420 --> 03:31:00,899
Should I?

3053
03:31:00,899 --> 03:31:02,420
No, the rat's not real.

3054
03:31:02,420 --> 03:31:03,139
The rat's not real.

3055
03:31:03,139 --> 03:31:03,620
Don't do that.

3056
03:31:04,579 --> 03:31:20,659
Well, I would have stabbed him and killed him.

3057
03:31:21,459 --> 03:31:22,819
If I had stabbed the monster,

3058
03:31:22,819 --> 03:31:24,979
I would have killed like somebody else.

3059
03:31:25,540 --> 03:31:34,360
Are you Brad?

3060
03:31:37,459 --> 03:31:38,180
I am now.

3061
03:31:53,989 --> 03:31:54,629
You hungry?

3062
03:31:57,110 --> 03:31:58,069
I heard some like,

3063
03:31:58,069 --> 03:31:58,870
stomach noises.

3064
03:31:59,510 --> 03:32:01,360
I just wonder if you need a snack.

3065
03:32:06,049 --> 03:32:07,329
I didn't want to stab.

3066
03:32:07,329 --> 03:32:07,809
That was.

3067
03:32:07,809 --> 03:32:09,170
I didn't want to stab you.

3068
03:32:10,049 --> 03:32:13,649
So I'm like, oh, I'll get the monster in my.

3069
03:32:13,649 --> 03:32:14,149
Let me see.

3070
03:32:14,690 --> 03:32:15,489
Duke of Milan?

3071
03:32:15,569 --> 03:32:16,129
No engine.

3072
03:32:16,690 --> 03:32:17,969
Yes, that's pretty much the end of it.

3073
03:32:18,690 --> 03:32:19,329
Looks like it.

3074
03:32:20,129 --> 03:32:21,329
You know, I was hoping to die.

3075
03:32:22,930 --> 03:32:23,889
I could have done nothing.

3076
03:32:32,579 --> 03:32:33,700
Yeah, but whatever.

3077
03:32:33,700 --> 03:32:36,340
I, I we've been going out.

3078
03:32:36,340 --> 03:32:37,860
So you got scared on my screen.

3079
03:32:37,860 --> 03:32:39,299
You were running away from a rat.

3080
03:32:39,940 --> 03:32:40,260
Yes.

3081
03:32:40,260 --> 03:32:43,059
And on my screen, the rat busted through my chest

3082
03:32:43,059 --> 03:32:43,860
and was killing me.

3083
03:32:44,659 --> 03:32:46,979
And I had a choice to stab the monster,

3084
03:32:46,979 --> 03:32:48,420
which was you probably,

3085
03:32:48,420 --> 03:32:49,940
or the rat in my stomach.

3086
03:32:49,940 --> 03:32:51,780
And I realized, wait, the rat's not real.

3087
03:32:51,780 --> 03:32:53,219
I just, I killed myself.

3088
03:32:54,579 --> 03:32:55,700
Rat in my stomach.

3089
03:32:55,700 --> 03:32:57,299
He was everything I ever wanted to be, you know?

3090
03:32:58,420 --> 03:33:00,260
I just wanted to be able to tell him.

3091
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:00,819
I'm sorry.

3092
03:33:02,260 --> 03:33:05,040
And now I'll never get that chance.

3093
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:06,819
He's fucking dead.

3094
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:11,200
God, I'm so sorry.

3095
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:12,559
Wait, that's not the end of the game.

3096
03:33:12,559 --> 03:33:13,440
I'm so sorry.

3097
03:33:17,639 --> 03:33:20,760
You killed the person with arguably the most personal connection

3098
03:33:20,760 --> 03:33:22,360
to any of these characters.

3099
03:33:22,360 --> 03:33:27,479
Nobody would care if Chad died.

3100
03:33:27,479 --> 03:33:28,040
What's his name?

3101
03:33:29,729 --> 03:33:30,129
Drew.

3102
03:33:30,129 --> 03:33:30,770
Wait, hold on.

3103
03:33:30,770 --> 03:33:31,969
That's the end of the game.

3104
03:33:37,090 --> 03:33:37,569
No, it's not.

3105
03:33:40,209 --> 03:33:40,770
Conrad.

3106
03:33:47,799 --> 03:33:48,920
That's the end.

3107
03:33:50,879 --> 03:33:51,920
I guess that's the end.

3108
03:33:51,920 --> 03:33:54,000
That's how you make core games nowadays.

3109
03:33:55,409 --> 03:33:58,450
By the way, on my screen, there was a piece of paper

3110
03:33:58,450 --> 03:34:00,930
that confirmed my theory that it was a military weapon

3111
03:34:01,569 --> 03:34:02,530
when roped.

3112
03:34:02,530 --> 03:34:03,969
So literally the next scene.

3113
03:34:05,030 --> 03:34:05,989
That's it.

3114
03:34:05,989 --> 03:34:07,030
Game over.

3115
03:34:07,030 --> 03:34:08,149
You're dumb.

3116
03:34:08,149 --> 03:34:08,709
You're dumb?

3117
03:34:09,590 --> 03:34:10,790
Oh, I thought he said I'm dumb.

3118
03:34:10,790 --> 03:34:11,750
I was supposed to say fuck you.

3119
03:34:11,750 --> 03:34:14,229
You can't do better next time around.

3120
03:34:14,229 --> 03:34:17,159
Impressive.

3121
03:34:18,040 --> 03:34:19,639
Almost everyone survived.

3122
03:34:20,659 --> 03:34:22,100
The last fucking cutesy.

3123
03:34:22,100 --> 03:34:23,139
Oh, god damn it.

3124
03:34:23,139 --> 03:34:23,459
Really?

3125
03:34:24,959 --> 03:34:26,559
And the distributor cap?

3126
03:34:27,889 --> 03:34:29,940
Boom.

3127
03:34:29,940 --> 03:34:30,500
All right, yeah.

3128
03:34:31,540 --> 03:34:34,100
Apparently, I broke that, but it wasn't my fault.

3129
03:34:34,100 --> 03:34:34,739
It's all about...

3130
03:34:34,739 --> 03:34:35,700
Wait, hold on.

3131
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:37,780
Give me some credit here.

3132
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:38,979
My game broke.

3133
03:34:38,979 --> 03:34:40,979
I teleported into a room

3134
03:34:40,979 --> 03:34:43,860
and then the cutscene jumped around in three different rooms.

3135
03:34:43,860 --> 03:34:45,379
You got to give me some credit here.

3136
03:34:45,379 --> 03:34:46,180
That was bullshit.

3137
03:34:46,739 --> 03:34:48,659
I teleported into the laundry room.

3138
03:34:49,860 --> 03:34:50,500
But then...

3139
03:34:50,500 --> 03:34:52,340
And then my character changed clothes.

3140
03:34:56,129 --> 03:34:58,049
And then a guy was being eaten by rats

3141
03:34:58,049 --> 03:35:00,049
and then I got a knife and I had to stab myself.

3142
03:35:01,319 --> 03:35:02,680
You got to see what happened to me

3143
03:35:03,479 --> 03:35:04,680
when you were the monster

3144
03:35:04,680 --> 03:35:07,319
because it had to have been more abrupt.

3145
03:35:07,319 --> 03:35:08,440
Till we meet again,

3146
03:35:09,159 --> 03:35:10,680
maybe in Little Hope,

3147
03:35:10,680 --> 03:35:12,120
maybe somewhere else.

3148
03:35:13,879 --> 03:35:14,840
But be certain,

3149
03:35:15,639 --> 03:35:16,760
we will meet again.

3150
03:35:17,799 --> 03:35:20,200
It's inevitable.

3151
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:27,280
Regardless of how many people survived,

3152
03:35:27,280 --> 03:35:30,959
that is somehow worse than the Blair Witch ending yesterday.

3153
03:35:44,739 --> 03:35:47,219
Restart and don't break the distributor cap.

3154
03:35:47,219 --> 03:35:49,700
You want us to go through the three hours and 40 minutes?

3155
03:35:51,059 --> 03:35:53,540
How is this only three and a half hours, by the way?

3156
03:35:54,530 --> 03:35:56,129
We were playing on streamer time, too.

3157
03:35:56,129 --> 03:35:57,090
Wait, hold on.

3158
03:35:57,090 --> 03:35:58,690
So how did you break the distributor cap?

3159
03:35:59,250 --> 03:35:59,649
I don't know.

3160
03:35:59,649 --> 03:36:01,649
There was a door and I tried to open it

3161
03:36:01,649 --> 03:36:04,610
and then I had to mash A and I successfully mashed A.

3162
03:36:04,610 --> 03:36:06,049
Then an elevator fell down

3163
03:36:06,049 --> 03:36:08,049
and then it broke the distributor cap that was down there.

3164
03:36:13,729 --> 03:36:15,409
I don't know how to even save that.

3165
03:36:17,010 --> 03:36:17,729
I can't skip it.

3166
03:36:20,530 --> 03:36:21,010
All right, let's...

3167
03:36:21,010 --> 03:36:22,370
You want to go back and try to save everybody?

3168
03:36:24,469 --> 03:36:26,149
Apparently, we can do a scene select.

3169
03:36:26,950 --> 03:36:28,149
Okay, let's do the scene select.

3170
03:36:29,440 --> 03:36:30,079
All right, hold on.

3171
03:36:34,530 --> 03:36:36,530
Elevator was Jerma's fault.

3172
03:36:36,530 --> 03:36:36,770
How?

3173
03:36:37,489 --> 03:36:38,129
Was it?

3174
03:36:38,129 --> 03:36:38,930
What did I do?

3175
03:36:38,930 --> 03:36:40,690
My character like teleported around

3176
03:36:40,690 --> 03:36:42,610
and then like I saw something break.

3177
03:36:47,639 --> 03:36:50,840
I'm like an innocent bystander for this whole game.

3178
03:36:51,479 --> 03:36:52,920
I don't think I chose one.

3179
03:36:52,920 --> 03:36:54,440
Oh, I did choose not to kill you.

3180
03:36:54,440 --> 03:36:58,200
I think I took too long getting to the elevator.

3181
03:36:59,879 --> 03:37:00,280
I don't know.

3182
03:37:04,930 --> 03:37:05,409
What is this?

3183
03:37:07,040 --> 03:37:08,479
Is this post credits?

3184
03:37:08,479 --> 03:37:08,719
Yeah.

3185
03:37:10,819 --> 03:37:11,780
They're going to kill everybody.

3186
03:37:12,979 --> 03:37:16,440
Protect the government secret.

3187
03:37:35,559 --> 03:37:37,639
So that whole thing was for fucking no reason?

3188
03:37:39,379 --> 03:37:40,420
Did I write this game?

3189
03:37:42,049 --> 03:37:42,850
Did I do this?

3190
03:37:44,129 --> 03:37:49,430
So even if all five got in, then it's all five go anyways.

3191
03:37:50,559 --> 03:37:52,239
Unless you protect the cap, apparently.

3192
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:54,959
Oh, you got to get the cap.

3193
03:37:54,959 --> 03:37:56,399
Did you escape on the boat?

3194
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:04,399
And then everyone died.

3195
03:38:05,120 --> 03:38:06,799
See, nothing that we did mattered.

3196
03:38:06,799 --> 03:38:09,440
No, like you can make it matter.

3197
03:38:10,479 --> 03:38:11,680
Oh, wait, is it preview?

3198
03:38:14,920 --> 03:38:15,719
I know that guy.

3199
03:38:16,440 --> 03:38:17,399
He's in a bunch of movies.

3200
03:38:40,959 --> 03:38:41,920
Little hope.

3201
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:43,120
In 2020?

3202
03:38:44,479 --> 03:38:47,760
That seems like a very long time away for episode two.

3203
03:38:48,559 --> 03:38:50,719
Well, here's the bad news.

3204
03:38:50,719 --> 03:38:52,079
It's a separate purchase, I think.

3205
03:38:52,719 --> 03:38:53,120
Is this?

3206
03:38:54,399 --> 03:38:55,120
I think it is.

3207
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:56,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3208
03:38:56,079 --> 03:38:57,440
Jack can correct me if I'm wrong.

3209
03:39:00,389 --> 03:39:01,510
Wait, hold on.

3210
03:39:01,510 --> 03:39:04,450
Slow down and back that up and just reverse it for a second.

3211
03:39:04,450 --> 03:39:08,049
I'm pretty sure this is a standalone purchase that we just played.

3212
03:39:08,049 --> 03:39:11,809
This is a three hour and like 20 minute experience, essentially.

3213
03:39:11,809 --> 03:39:12,690
Uh-huh.

3214
03:39:12,690 --> 03:39:12,930
Yeah.

3215
03:39:12,930 --> 03:39:13,409
It's $40.

3216
03:39:14,850 --> 03:39:16,049
And then episode two.

3217
03:39:16,049 --> 03:39:16,610
How much was it?

3218
03:39:16,610 --> 03:39:17,569
Was it 30 or 40 bucks?

3219
03:39:17,569 --> 03:39:18,129
How much was this?

3220
03:39:19,010 --> 03:39:24,120
It wasn't 40, I don't think.

3221
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:24,840
Is it 30?

3222
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:25,639
All right, is there okay?

3223
03:39:26,840 --> 03:39:27,399
All right, all right.

3224
03:39:28,360 --> 03:39:29,319
That's apparently it's 30.

3225
03:39:33,280 --> 03:39:37,840
Yeah, and they didn't do the way out where only one person has to buy it

3226
03:39:37,840 --> 03:39:39,200
to like play with the other person.

3227
03:39:39,920 --> 03:39:40,879
So we both bought it.

3228
03:39:40,879 --> 03:39:44,319
That is technically one ending you can get, right?

3229
03:39:44,879 --> 03:39:48,709
So I mean, you could technically play through this game like a few times, right?

3230
03:39:48,709 --> 03:39:55,520
I think this would be worth it if you, at least I'm down, I'm at zero, so.

3231
03:39:55,520 --> 03:39:57,760
Wait, you get this game at zero?

3232
03:39:57,760 --> 03:40:00,239
No, no, no, like OBS is at zero.

3233
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:03,219
Oh, but I hear you.

3234
03:40:03,219 --> 03:40:03,940
I'm still alive.

3235
03:40:06,479 --> 03:40:06,959
Anyway.

3236
03:40:10,229 --> 03:40:13,430
Okay, because that was like that transition was just like, you know, it'll be great.

3237
03:40:13,430 --> 03:40:16,229
I mean, I mean, I'm at a zero right now, essentially.

3238
03:40:17,430 --> 03:40:19,670
I don't know why I'm still at zero.

3239
03:40:19,670 --> 03:40:19,989
What?

3240
03:40:20,870 --> 03:40:22,870
Yeah, it must be VPN.

3241
03:40:22,870 --> 03:40:26,629
Maybe it's a VPN spoken up because I'm still fine.

3242
03:40:27,430 --> 03:40:29,440
Maybe it's, yeah, that's weird.

3243
03:40:29,440 --> 03:40:30,239
You should come back.

3244
03:40:30,239 --> 03:40:31,040
It's very soon here.

3245
03:40:31,920 --> 03:40:33,860
It's actually not Cox.

3246
03:40:34,420 --> 03:40:35,700
No, not Cox this time.

3247
03:40:37,780 --> 03:40:40,020
You want to try to do the last part again?

3248
03:40:40,819 --> 03:40:42,520
See what happens.

3249
03:40:42,520 --> 03:40:43,559
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

3250
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:46,959
Let's do that final scene and see if we can do it.

3251
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:51,079
I'm going to invite you.

3252
03:41:01,239 --> 03:41:01,959
Hold on.

3253
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:05,000
So like, okay, if you do that.

3254
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:06,600
Technical difficulties.

3255
03:41:06,600 --> 03:41:07,239
Yeah, do you think?

3256
03:41:08,200 --> 03:41:09,559
I'm just gonna hang up for a little bit.

3257
03:41:09,559 --> 03:41:18,739
So if you play this game alone, there goes kind of all the fun.

3258
03:41:22,850 --> 03:41:28,129
Yeah, I mean, whatever fun you have is absolutely not present.

3259
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:29,969
Because, oh, is it?

3260
03:41:29,969 --> 03:41:35,250
I mean, once we figured it out that it was like, wait a minute, are you Brad?

3261
03:41:35,250 --> 03:41:36,290
Oh, hey, am I Brad?

3262
03:41:37,360 --> 03:41:38,079
Wait, who are you?

3263
03:41:38,719 --> 03:41:40,399
That was like, oh, that's kind of fun.

3264
03:41:41,040 --> 03:41:45,600
But if you do that by yourself, you don't get to ask your friend.

3265
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:46,159
Are you Brad?

3266
03:41:58,260 --> 03:41:59,379
Mad because Brad.

3267
03:42:00,180 --> 03:42:10,340
$30 for are you Brad?

3268
03:42:15,940 --> 03:42:22,319
I mean, it seems like there's, I wish there was more there.

3269
03:42:22,319 --> 03:42:26,549
It felt like the first, I guess, can people like die on the boat?

3270
03:42:26,549 --> 03:42:28,870
I don't know how we didn't lose somebody on the boat.

3271
03:42:28,870 --> 03:42:32,229
How do I stab myself in the stomach at the very last QTE of the game?

3272
03:42:33,379 --> 03:42:37,620
And no one died during the hostage situation on the boat?

3273
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:39,120
That makes no sense.

3274
03:42:43,399 --> 03:42:46,040
We like dropped the gun, dropped the knife, like dodged.

3275
03:42:46,760 --> 03:42:48,120
QTE fail, punched in the face.

3276
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:49,479
How do you play this game in couch co-op?

3277
03:42:50,200 --> 03:42:50,600
I don't know.

3278
03:42:50,600 --> 03:42:52,440
I think you just all watch, I think you watch a movie.

3279
03:42:54,209 --> 03:42:56,530
Because wouldn't you know all the information that the other people know?

3280
03:42:59,059 --> 03:42:59,540
I guess.

3281
03:43:00,899 --> 03:43:05,540
So how would, where would the secret be if someone's the monster or not?

3282
03:43:05,540 --> 03:43:07,700
Maybe I guess they just don't control the monster.

3283
03:43:08,659 --> 03:43:10,549
It just cuts part of the scene.

3284
03:43:10,549 --> 03:43:11,190
Oh, I wonder.

3285
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:14,600
Anyways, are you, are you, are you green?

3286
03:43:14,600 --> 03:43:15,159
Are you good?

3287
03:43:15,159 --> 03:43:15,719
Yeah.

3288
03:43:15,719 --> 03:43:18,239
Okay, I'm inviting you.

3289
03:43:26,520 --> 03:43:27,399
No screen thinking.

3290
03:43:27,399 --> 03:43:29,719
It is weird that we went through the whole game.

3291
03:43:29,719 --> 03:43:33,639
I mean, I know it was only three and a half hours, but still.

3292
03:43:35,239 --> 03:43:40,120
And one little decision at the very end dictates the entire.

3293
03:43:41,940 --> 03:43:45,940
Okay, so this is matters of the heart radio room, right?

3294
03:43:46,659 --> 03:43:47,700
Is the last scene.

3295
03:43:48,930 --> 03:43:49,889
I guess so.

3296
03:43:49,889 --> 03:43:51,649
Would you like to overwrite the current save?

3297
03:43:52,450 --> 03:43:54,200
No reason not to.

3298
03:43:54,200 --> 03:43:55,399
Is it the end?

3299
03:43:55,399 --> 03:43:56,600
No, it's not the end, is it?

3300
03:44:04,950 --> 03:44:06,370
Okay, here we go.

3301
03:44:06,850 --> 03:44:10,850
But anyway, my thought was if they made it where one person buys it and can invite

3302
03:44:10,850 --> 03:44:16,290
a friend for free for co-op and it might be worth $15 per person.

3303
03:44:17,809 --> 03:44:21,219
Maybe, but let's see what happens.

3304
03:44:21,780 --> 03:44:22,180
Let's see.

3305
03:44:22,180 --> 03:44:24,100
Let's try to get it because we had all five people.

3306
03:44:27,430 --> 03:44:31,430
Yeah, we had, everybody was alive up until the last second.

3307
03:44:31,989 --> 03:44:32,229
Yes.

3308
03:44:33,110 --> 03:44:35,909
And then the actual thing is saving the boat.

3309
03:44:37,430 --> 03:44:44,659
Okay, so we're going to, I'm not going to stab anything.

3310
03:44:46,149 --> 03:44:48,629
And then what, what, what you had to tap something to save the.

3311
03:44:49,510 --> 03:44:51,350
The, um, the.

3312
03:44:51,350 --> 03:44:52,709
All I have to do is open a door.

3313
03:44:55,319 --> 03:44:56,920
Somebody said the elevator was your fault.

3314
03:44:57,639 --> 03:45:01,280
Also, I don't know if that's true or not.

3315
03:45:01,280 --> 03:45:02,290
All right, here we go.

3316
03:45:07,620 --> 03:45:08,340
So same thing.

3317
03:45:08,340 --> 03:45:10,239
I'm you off list.

3318
03:45:10,239 --> 03:45:11,600
I'm Alex.

3319
03:45:11,600 --> 03:45:13,680
Why I'm going to check the next level.

3320
03:45:13,680 --> 03:45:15,360
There might be some more gear down there we can use.

3321
03:45:16,239 --> 03:45:19,040
Just wait by the radio.

3322
03:45:19,760 --> 03:45:21,600
I'm going to hang back here as well.

3323
03:45:22,559 --> 03:45:24,659
All right.

3324
03:45:24,659 --> 03:45:27,940
So when I did this last time, I apparently took too long doing this.

3325
03:45:28,579 --> 03:45:59,590
Just go and grab the thing who stays, who goes.

3326
03:46:01,350 --> 03:46:09,969
Okay.

3327
03:46:10,930 --> 03:46:14,229
He said the name of my stream.

3328
03:46:14,229 --> 03:46:15,590
He said the name of my stream.

3329
03:46:17,030 --> 03:46:20,549
I saw the big guy way too excited about this.

3330
03:46:22,549 --> 03:46:27,670
Uh, we just spotty swapped.

3331
03:46:27,670 --> 03:46:28,549
We didn't know.

3332
03:46:29,969 --> 03:46:30,290
All right.

3333
03:46:30,290 --> 03:46:31,090
So what was the thing?

3334
03:46:31,090 --> 03:46:32,370
What's the thing I'm supposed to grab?

3335
03:46:33,170 --> 03:46:37,889
We got to get the cap from the big guy.

3336
03:46:39,829 --> 03:46:42,629
And then we separate and then I, what was I supposed to get?

3337
03:46:50,079 --> 03:46:51,680
It just, it did just kind of end.

3338
03:46:53,270 --> 03:46:55,110
Just don't activate the elevator.

3339
03:46:56,149 --> 03:46:57,350
Don't activate the elevator.

3340
03:46:57,989 --> 03:47:01,889
This must have been what we just heard.

3341
03:47:09,110 --> 03:47:09,750
Okay.

3342
03:47:09,750 --> 03:47:10,309
Here we go.

3343
03:47:10,309 --> 03:47:10,870
What's that?

3344
03:47:11,590 --> 03:47:12,790
Does it matter?

3345
03:47:12,790 --> 03:47:15,270
We need that distributor cap here.

3346
03:47:15,989 --> 03:47:17,190
He had to have come this way.

3347
03:47:18,149 --> 03:47:23,680
You have to find the guy as fast as you can.

3348
03:47:23,680 --> 03:47:24,000
Okay.

3349
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:26,850
I'll try.

3350
03:47:27,889 --> 03:47:30,049
I don't think I even have anything I can do.

3351
03:47:30,049 --> 03:47:30,690
I think I just.

3352
03:47:36,479 --> 03:47:38,549
Here we go.

3353
03:47:41,190 --> 03:47:43,280
All right.

3354
03:47:43,280 --> 03:47:44,000
He's holding it.

3355
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:48,850
And then he reads down the hallway.

3356
03:47:50,450 --> 03:47:54,020
And then you have to jump successfully.

3357
03:47:54,020 --> 03:47:54,260
Yeah.

3358
03:47:55,139 --> 03:47:56,639
Should be excellent.

3359
03:48:02,739 --> 03:48:03,559
Okay.

3360
03:48:03,559 --> 03:48:05,299
I'm good.

3361
03:48:05,299 --> 03:48:07,250
There he is.

3362
03:48:08,129 --> 03:48:12,340
Okay.

3363
03:48:13,219 --> 03:48:15,959
It's Alex.

3364
03:48:15,959 --> 03:48:17,079
Don't open the door.

3365
03:48:17,079 --> 03:48:17,719
Somebody's saying.

3366
03:48:17,719 --> 03:48:19,079
I'm not, I'm not going to open the door.

3367
03:48:19,799 --> 03:48:28,469
Okay.

3368
03:48:28,469 --> 03:48:29,989
So where, where am I now?

3369
03:48:30,629 --> 03:48:38,950
So he's like just sitting in the corner down here.

3370
03:48:39,909 --> 03:48:46,629
I'm not going to make this jump, Alex.

3371
03:48:46,629 --> 03:48:47,989
I'll have to find another way around.

3372
03:48:49,030 --> 03:48:54,200
Did that happen last time?

3373
03:48:54,200 --> 03:48:54,760
I don't know.

3374
03:48:55,159 --> 03:48:55,879
I don't remember that.

3375
03:48:56,840 --> 03:48:58,200
Him just dying in the corner?

3376
03:48:58,760 --> 03:48:59,079
No, no.

3377
03:48:59,079 --> 03:48:59,719
I remember that.

3378
03:49:00,360 --> 03:49:02,440
But I can open this door, right?

3379
03:49:02,440 --> 03:49:04,280
They said don't open the elevator door.

3380
03:49:04,280 --> 03:49:04,520
Yeah.

3381
03:49:04,520 --> 03:49:05,399
I can open this door.

3382
03:49:06,040 --> 03:49:08,370
Okay.

3383
03:49:08,370 --> 03:49:09,010
Now, where is he?

3384
03:49:09,569 --> 03:49:15,590
Okay.

3385
03:49:15,590 --> 03:49:16,629
Oh, sorry.

3386
03:49:17,190 --> 03:49:17,510
RB.

3387
03:49:18,979 --> 03:49:19,219
Okay.

3388
03:49:19,219 --> 03:49:19,940
This scary thing.

3389
03:49:19,940 --> 03:49:21,299
One letter short of BRB.

3390
03:49:22,389 --> 03:49:23,030
Maybe that's why.

3391
03:49:23,829 --> 03:49:24,469
Minus two.

3392
03:49:24,469 --> 03:49:25,430
I, I took care of it.

3393
03:49:25,430 --> 03:49:26,069
Thank you, Chad.

3394
03:49:26,069 --> 03:49:26,549
Oh, okay.

3395
03:49:27,430 --> 03:49:31,120
Then now where is he?

3396
03:49:31,120 --> 03:49:32,399
Is he in this, this laundry room?

3397
03:49:32,399 --> 03:49:33,440
I was laundry room.

3398
03:49:39,409 --> 03:49:39,729
There.

3399
03:49:39,729 --> 03:49:39,969
Okay.

3400
03:49:40,690 --> 03:49:41,940
Let me see it.

3401
03:49:42,819 --> 03:49:46,149
I looked at this.

3402
03:49:47,809 --> 03:49:48,290
Okay.

3403
03:49:48,290 --> 03:49:49,889
Just trying to re-flip, retrace the steps.

3404
03:49:50,530 --> 03:49:51,489
You found a secret.

3405
03:49:51,489 --> 03:49:51,729
Good.

3406
03:49:53,780 --> 03:49:54,180
All right.

3407
03:49:54,899 --> 03:50:02,100
I didn't even know this was, this was here.

3408
03:50:03,270 --> 03:50:03,590
Okay.

3409
03:50:05,170 --> 03:50:05,969
I found it.

3410
03:50:08,879 --> 03:50:13,379
Fuck.

3411
03:50:13,379 --> 03:50:13,700
All right.

3412
03:50:13,700 --> 03:50:15,860
Do you, I'm, I'm about to be in possession.

3413
03:50:16,500 --> 03:50:21,040
You just can't look.

3414
03:50:21,040 --> 03:50:29,280
I just have to grab.

3415
03:50:29,280 --> 03:50:30,079
I'm, I'm going to get it.

3416
03:50:34,309 --> 03:50:36,309
What the fuck did you do that for?

3417
03:50:40,159 --> 03:50:40,479
Got it.

3418
03:50:41,200 --> 03:50:42,959
Okay.

3419
03:50:42,959 --> 03:50:43,520
I have the cap.

3420
03:50:44,239 --> 03:50:48,159
Alex has found a secret.

3421
03:50:48,959 --> 03:50:49,680
Did you just do that?

3422
03:50:50,559 --> 03:50:54,469
You, it, it yoinked me into the door.

3423
03:50:55,350 --> 03:50:55,989
I have the cap.

3424
03:51:02,000 --> 03:51:03,520
It doesn't look like you have the cap.

3425
03:51:04,239 --> 03:51:06,340
It looks like you're fighting a rat monster.

3426
03:51:07,059 --> 03:51:07,299
All right.

3427
03:51:07,299 --> 03:51:08,579
The cap is, we, we're good.

3428
03:51:12,950 --> 03:51:14,950
That's a sca, I knew it was coming.

3429
03:51:15,510 --> 03:51:16,469
Don't stab anybody.

3430
03:51:18,079 --> 03:51:18,559
Who are you?

3431
03:51:20,399 --> 03:51:26,709
Say nothing.

3432
03:51:29,360 --> 03:51:30,079
It looks sad.

3433
03:51:31,409 --> 03:51:31,649
Okay.

3434
03:51:32,209 --> 03:51:34,719
I'm afraid.

3435
03:51:37,299 --> 03:51:39,780
Okay.

3436
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:41,159
No.

3437
03:51:42,600 --> 03:51:45,350
Now don't do anything.

3438
03:51:52,959 --> 03:51:54,879
No, I'm not going to kill him for the joke.

3439
03:51:54,879 --> 03:51:55,840
I want to beat the game.

3440
03:51:56,719 --> 03:52:07,590
Okay.

3441
03:52:07,590 --> 03:52:07,909
Okay.

3442
03:52:13,909 --> 03:52:14,149
Shit.

3443
03:52:14,950 --> 03:52:17,909
Now what?

3444
03:52:17,909 --> 03:52:24,680
How many times are you going to try and like?

3445
03:52:25,969 --> 03:52:26,450
It's okay.

3446
03:52:27,680 --> 03:52:28,159
There we are.

3447
03:52:28,719 --> 03:52:30,899
Fliss.

3448
03:52:31,459 --> 03:52:37,110
Gotcha.

3449
03:52:37,829 --> 03:52:39,959
That's five out of five.

3450
03:52:39,959 --> 03:52:41,239
I'm not even going to apologize.

3451
03:52:42,120 --> 03:52:43,079
Oh, Fliss, it's you.

3452
03:52:43,079 --> 03:52:43,719
All right, let's go.

3453
03:52:44,360 --> 03:52:46,850
That's a solid five out of five right there.

3454
03:52:46,850 --> 03:52:47,729
Hi, everyone's safe.

3455
03:52:47,729 --> 03:52:48,690
Everyone's alive.

3456
03:52:48,690 --> 03:52:51,250
That's all I needed was this piece of boat.

3457
03:52:51,809 --> 03:52:52,770
Now I can leave.

3458
03:52:56,399 --> 03:52:56,719
Okay.

3459
03:52:56,719 --> 03:52:58,959
If we get like gunned down here again.

3460
03:53:00,079 --> 03:53:01,280
They're going to set off in the boat,

3461
03:53:01,280 --> 03:53:02,319
that they came there in.

3462
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:18,629
We did it.

3463
03:53:18,629 --> 03:53:21,270
Oh, you did it.

3464
03:53:21,270 --> 03:53:22,389
You saved everybody.

3465
03:53:23,670 --> 03:53:25,430
Did they write any dialogue for this ending?

3466
03:53:26,389 --> 03:53:29,729
Where's Conrad?

3467
03:53:30,290 --> 03:53:33,250
All right, let's try it.

3468
03:53:49,139 --> 03:53:50,260
Conrad's not on the boat.

3469
03:53:50,899 --> 03:53:56,479
There's only four people.

3470
03:53:57,360 --> 03:54:04,500
Everybody got their, the true timeline.

3471
03:54:04,500 --> 03:54:05,379
Everybody got their wish.

3472
03:54:10,340 --> 03:54:13,379
Conrad was just an hallucination from the gas.

3473
03:54:13,379 --> 03:54:14,420
That explains a lot.

3474
03:54:15,139 --> 03:54:16,340
He was kind of a monster.

3475
03:54:17,459 --> 03:54:20,799
This was about curing gold.

3476
03:54:21,520 --> 03:54:24,600
Well, that turned out to be quite a bit different than we expected.

3477
03:54:25,319 --> 03:54:27,620
You know, I just keep going over it and over it.

3478
03:54:28,420 --> 03:54:30,719
And it doesn't make any sense, you know?

3479
03:54:30,719 --> 03:54:33,639
And I know what I saw.

3480
03:54:33,639 --> 03:54:35,559
Well, guys, I found the paperwork that explains it.

3481
03:54:35,559 --> 03:54:38,600
Don't believe in whatever it was that I saw.

3482
03:54:39,399 --> 03:54:40,200
I saw Alex.

3483
03:54:41,079 --> 03:54:42,120
It wasn't Alex.

3484
03:54:42,120 --> 03:54:44,870
It was one else.

3485
03:54:45,750 --> 03:54:47,360
But they look just like Alex.

3486
03:54:48,000 --> 03:54:50,079
And he was sneering at me.

3487
03:54:50,079 --> 03:54:52,159
He doesn't really like explore very much of this, huh?

3488
03:54:52,799 --> 03:54:53,440
Oh, there he is.

3489
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:59,600
It's kind of like, hey, if you breathe this stuff and you become a monster,

3490
03:55:00,719 --> 03:55:01,440
time to go home.

3491
03:55:03,569 --> 03:55:04,049
This guy.

3492
03:55:04,850 --> 03:55:09,329
Yeah, I feel like this game needed like another two full hours to like keep that going.

3493
03:55:10,819 --> 03:55:15,139
Well, they kind of did the you're a monster, not really in the prologue.

3494
03:55:15,139 --> 03:55:19,059
And then that there wasn't another thing for the rest of the game.

3495
03:55:19,860 --> 03:55:25,510
That was the joke trick gotcha moment in the first 25 minutes.

3496
03:55:25,510 --> 03:55:27,670
And then they just did it again two more times.

3497
03:55:28,389 --> 03:55:33,510
And I guess let's see how this let's see.

3498
03:55:34,229 --> 03:55:36,229
Let's see our critique from our professor here.

3499
03:55:40,930 --> 03:55:42,450
Rewinding to fix the story.

3500
03:55:43,409 --> 03:55:44,200
Pathetic.

3501
03:55:48,870 --> 03:55:51,030
Congratulations.

3502
03:55:51,030 --> 03:55:53,590
All your charges are still breathing.

3503
03:55:53,590 --> 03:55:56,469
And that's something I suppose.

3504
03:55:57,430 --> 03:56:03,030
Things became a little intense, but Alex kept his nerve.

3505
03:56:03,030 --> 03:56:04,229
Well done, Alex.

3506
03:56:04,229 --> 03:56:05,350
Well done, you.

3507
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:09,600
Oh, it's all about decisions, isn't it?

3508
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:16,239
Decisions made in a hurry in a panic made with the heart instead of the head or vice versa.

3509
03:56:17,200 --> 03:56:21,680
Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.

3510
03:56:22,799 --> 03:56:27,729
But there are repercussions for always repercussions.

3511
03:56:28,690 --> 03:56:40,549
Scream and watch out this dude's British.

3512
03:56:40,549 --> 03:56:45,110
We meet again, maybe in little hope, maybe somewhere else.

3513
03:56:45,829 --> 03:56:49,760
But be certain we will meet again.

3514
03:56:50,799 --> 03:56:53,200
It's inevitable.

3515
03:56:59,379 --> 03:57:01,540
All right, apparently we need to watch this.

3516
03:57:02,739 --> 03:57:04,100
I thought you just started singing.

3517
03:57:04,739 --> 03:57:05,940
I was like, holy shit.

3518
03:57:05,940 --> 03:57:06,659
Okay, I'm going to.

3519
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:18,709
Oh, sorry, please.

3520
03:57:19,750 --> 03:57:21,430
All right, we're not supposed to watch after the credits.

3521
03:57:21,430 --> 03:57:22,229
Did you skip the credits?

3522
03:57:23,430 --> 03:57:24,469
Won't you spare me?

3523
03:57:24,469 --> 03:57:26,149
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3524
03:57:26,149 --> 03:57:26,950
We had to skip this.

3525
03:57:26,950 --> 03:57:27,750
We had to skip this part.

3526
03:57:27,750 --> 03:57:28,469
We got to get the credit.

3527
03:57:28,469 --> 03:57:29,430
Don't skip after this.

3528
03:57:30,469 --> 03:57:30,969
Here we go.

3529
03:57:33,670 --> 03:57:35,430
They're going to just shoot us when we get to the beach.

3530
03:57:36,709 --> 03:57:47,350
Already lived.

3531
03:58:05,139 --> 03:58:06,260
Oh, Danny, no.

3532
03:58:07,059 --> 03:58:07,559
Danny.

3533
03:58:08,420 --> 03:58:09,540
All right, they saved us.

3534
03:58:11,110 --> 03:58:12,069
Danny was alive.

3535
03:58:12,709 --> 03:58:19,860
Aren't they just going to they have gas masks on or just like.

3536
03:58:21,139 --> 03:58:23,940
So out of nowhere, this thing just sent out an SOS.

3537
03:58:23,940 --> 03:58:25,940
I guess we got a real life ghost ship here.

3538
03:58:27,379 --> 03:58:34,469
Well, what's rowdy pause the game.

3539
03:58:34,469 --> 03:58:36,069
Please reconnect your controller.

3540
03:58:36,069 --> 03:58:37,270
What the fuck are you talking about?

3541
03:58:45,670 --> 03:58:48,389
Trying to ruin the perfect ending at the last second again, I see.

3542
03:58:51,750 --> 03:58:53,940
Well, what the hell is this?

3543
03:58:56,930 --> 03:59:00,530
Danny was dead and he wakes up to die again at the end.

3544
03:59:00,530 --> 03:59:01,809
Credits if you don't save him.

3545
03:59:02,530 --> 03:59:04,209
That is so hilariously stupid.

3546
03:59:09,219 --> 03:59:10,819
There's a lock on one of these.

3547
03:59:10,819 --> 03:59:15,270
I don't know if you were there with me when I investigated this room.

3548
03:59:23,040 --> 03:59:24,239
But they don't have a gun.

3549
03:59:30,239 --> 03:59:30,799
Never mind.

3550
03:59:30,799 --> 03:59:33,989
Danny is he breathed the mist.

3551
03:59:45,200 --> 03:59:48,000
And just like every other like HBO show you watch.

3552
03:59:48,959 --> 03:59:52,559
Here's the trailer for the big thing they got coming out next month.

3553
03:59:59,559 --> 04:00:06,120
Why are we watching this unskippable?

3554
04:00:07,239 --> 04:00:08,600
It is unskippable.

3555
04:00:09,639 --> 04:00:22,930
All right, we did it.

3556
04:00:22,930 --> 04:00:23,569
We did do it.

3557
04:00:23,569 --> 04:00:25,170
And that's not coming out till 2020.

3558
04:00:26,209 --> 04:00:29,920
I mean, there's only three months till 2020.

3559
04:00:29,920 --> 04:00:33,520
But yes, that seems like a long time, though, to have anybody like continue.

3560
04:00:33,520 --> 04:00:36,399
Oh, yeah, the dark, the dark picture is anthology.

3561
04:00:37,680 --> 04:00:39,120
To be clear, it's $30.

3562
04:00:40,559 --> 04:00:41,280
Not 40.

3563
04:00:41,280 --> 04:00:48,040
But you know, I'm not sure I agree with the C and four months mentality.

3564
04:00:50,719 --> 04:00:53,840
They're saying that for the for twice as much money,

3565
04:00:53,840 --> 04:00:56,000
probably less now that there's sales.

3566
04:00:56,000 --> 04:00:58,399
You could buy full price Detroit become human.

3567
04:01:04,610 --> 04:01:06,209
Yeah, I can't say.

3568
04:01:06,209 --> 04:01:08,610
I mean, it was it was funny.

3569
04:01:09,170 --> 04:01:10,770
There was some stuff that was interesting.

3570
04:01:11,729 --> 04:01:14,739
But I almost wish that they didn't do this whole.

3571
04:01:14,739 --> 04:01:19,700
Let's make like eight of these little games and just make one good one.

3572
04:01:19,700 --> 04:01:20,260
We're too good.

3573
04:01:20,260 --> 04:01:21,780
We don't want to do one or two, three.

3574
04:01:22,739 --> 04:01:23,219
Why eight?

3575
04:01:24,100 --> 04:01:27,219
Why not do three of these or two of these?

3576
04:01:27,860 --> 04:01:29,270
Why does it have to be that many?

3577
04:01:35,780 --> 04:01:37,840
Because I don't know.

3578
04:01:37,840 --> 04:01:39,760
It's in four and then in half.

3579
04:01:39,760 --> 04:01:42,159
I could just spend a little more time on each eight.

3580
04:01:42,159 --> 04:01:42,799
It's a lot.

3581
04:01:42,799 --> 04:01:44,399
Yeah, it's what is that?

3582
04:01:44,399 --> 04:01:45,840
They really want to do eight of these.

3583
04:01:49,010 --> 04:01:49,729
Is that for real?

3584
04:01:50,370 --> 04:01:53,329
But are they all $30 each?

3585
04:01:54,129 --> 04:01:57,319
I don't know.

3586
04:01:57,319 --> 04:01:59,239
That's like the most expensive DLC.

3587
04:01:59,959 --> 04:02:02,719
If they want to tell their stories, let them.

3588
04:02:03,799 --> 04:02:06,840
Yeah, but where we have to we're the ones buying them.

3589
04:02:07,559 --> 04:02:13,590
I guess we don't have to.

3590
04:02:13,590 --> 04:02:18,149
But I'm not on a subway sitting next to a guy telling like a scary story.

3591
04:02:21,989 --> 04:02:25,270
I think if you plan for eight, you have to be extremely confident about

3592
04:02:25,270 --> 04:02:26,549
how many sales you're going to get.

3593
04:02:27,110 --> 04:02:35,239
And I don't know if because Man of Medan seems to be kind of universally not anybody's favorite game.

3594
04:02:36,200 --> 04:02:39,959
So people will be willing to try the second time.

3595
04:02:39,959 --> 04:02:45,079
And if both the first two aren't up to par, then how are they going to make eight?

3596
04:02:47,079 --> 04:02:49,159
No one's going to buy three, four, five, six.

3597
04:02:49,159 --> 04:02:51,559
I mean, here's like a $500 IQ play.

3598
04:02:51,559 --> 04:02:56,040
Just wait like seven years for them all to go on like a steam sale.

3599
04:02:57,079 --> 04:03:04,129
Just wait for the Dark Pictures anthology, like eight game series to be like $11 in like 2028.

3600
04:03:05,409 --> 04:03:13,909
That's normal IQ.

3601
04:03:13,909 --> 04:03:14,469
Is it though?

3602
04:03:14,469 --> 04:03:15,909
It makes you I mean, that's pretty smart.

3603
04:03:16,629 --> 04:03:18,959
I like the idea.

3604
04:03:18,959 --> 04:03:25,120
I mean, until I would say the most fun part of the game was like that middle section when

3605
04:03:26,239 --> 04:03:28,399
you were like coming to get me.

3606
04:03:28,959 --> 04:03:31,920
And I thought you were the bad guy like in that middle section.

3607
04:03:31,920 --> 04:03:35,520
I think after that point, there was nothing left to tell.

3608
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:40,079
Once once we figured, okay, once we figured that out, then it was kind of like, wait, oh.

3609
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:43,600
And then they did like the kid runs across the screen two more times.

3610
04:03:46,020 --> 04:03:48,180
And then we just knew, you know, like, yeah.

3611
04:03:48,579 --> 04:03:53,379
After even if you even if we didn't talk about that, you ruined it, but you didn't ruin it.

3612
04:03:53,379 --> 04:03:56,520
Like when you said, hey, are you Brad?

3613
04:03:56,520 --> 04:03:57,559
Here's what I really thought.

3614
04:03:57,559 --> 04:04:01,559
Because what you didn't know is I took a five minute BRB because I'd take the dog outside.

3615
04:04:02,280 --> 04:04:06,920
And I just thought it would be funny because there was a guy on the ground with a bullet

3616
04:04:06,920 --> 04:04:08,520
in his chest and I thought he was cursed.

3617
04:04:08,520 --> 04:04:12,280
And I thought if I touched him that I would like wake him up and he'd become a zombie.

3618
04:04:12,280 --> 04:04:14,840
So I was just like, I'm just going to be here.

3619
04:04:15,399 --> 04:04:21,250
The second that I came back, you yoinked me into the next scene.

3620
04:04:21,250 --> 04:04:25,620
And that's when I was just getting chased by you.

3621
04:04:25,620 --> 04:04:26,899
So when you said, are you Brad?

3622
04:04:26,899 --> 04:04:30,739
What I thought was not that you were a good guy that I shouldn't kill,

3623
04:04:30,739 --> 04:04:34,420
but I thought you had taken over control as the ghost of the ship.

3624
04:04:34,420 --> 04:04:36,500
And you were going to it was going to I thought they were going to do like a

3625
04:04:37,459 --> 04:04:41,860
like a way out thing where we're actually adversarial for like the rest of the game.

3626
04:04:41,860 --> 04:04:45,059
Unfortunately, unfortunately, you didn't get my texts.

3627
04:04:46,920 --> 04:04:49,239
That's the one unfortunate part about this whole stream

3628
04:04:50,440 --> 04:04:52,920
because I wanted to change rooms.

3629
04:04:55,600 --> 04:04:59,280
I wanted to go into your room and you come into mine and like we're just like

3630
04:05:00,079 --> 04:05:03,040
for like I think people would have known immediately.

3631
04:05:06,069 --> 04:05:06,389
I don't know.

3632
04:05:06,389 --> 04:05:09,270
I really I think that would have been like instantaneously.

3633
04:05:12,069 --> 04:05:15,750
Because yeah, I would sound so much like better on your microphone.

3634
04:05:18,290 --> 04:05:19,969
I only had the camera on sometimes.

3635
04:05:19,969 --> 04:05:20,850
That's what I was asking.

3636
04:05:20,850 --> 04:05:23,489
I was like, hey, I'm like, hey, is your webcam on right now?

3637
04:05:24,290 --> 04:05:27,120
But I would have to leave it like full unmuted

3638
04:05:28,639 --> 04:05:30,079
because you wouldn't know where the button was.

3639
04:05:32,120 --> 04:05:33,399
I wouldn't know where it was.

3640
04:05:33,399 --> 04:05:34,760
I'd have to sneak into your room.

3641
04:05:36,120 --> 04:05:36,600
But all right.

3642
04:05:36,600 --> 04:05:37,239
Final thoughts.

3643
04:05:37,959 --> 04:05:40,440
Final thoughts on episode one.

3644
04:05:41,479 --> 04:05:42,920
Standalone Man of Medan.

3645
04:05:44,690 --> 04:05:51,520
I would say I like the idea of the shared co-op play

3646
04:05:51,520 --> 04:05:56,319
with a friend horror game unless you're going to play it in five player local

3647
04:05:56,319 --> 04:05:57,600
and everybody pitches it.

3648
04:06:00,680 --> 04:06:01,000
True.

3649
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:05,719
But it's also it's six dollars a person.

3650
04:06:06,770 --> 04:06:08,690
It opens the door couch co-op.

3651
04:06:11,459 --> 04:06:13,860
You can play couch co-op local with five players.

3652
04:06:15,840 --> 04:06:19,360
Have a little movie night for three and a half hours and pass the controller around.

3653
04:06:20,079 --> 04:06:22,559
Yeah, you can just have fun with it.

3654
04:06:22,559 --> 04:06:27,219
I think it opens the door for potentially having horror games

3655
04:06:27,620 --> 04:06:32,020
and having co-op experiences that are like that kind of way out experience.

3656
04:06:32,659 --> 04:06:33,780
Try to do more of that.

3657
04:06:34,659 --> 04:06:37,379
Hey, you're both playing at the same time, but you're not doing the same things.

3658
04:06:37,379 --> 04:06:37,940
But you are.

3659
04:06:37,940 --> 04:06:38,500
But you aren't.

3660
04:06:38,500 --> 04:06:39,219
But are you?

3661
04:06:39,219 --> 04:06:39,700
You are.

3662
04:06:40,819 --> 04:06:42,100
It's an interesting take on co-op.

3663
04:06:42,100 --> 04:06:44,659
But just the problem was very good.

3664
04:06:44,659 --> 04:06:45,459
I don't think it was very good.

3665
04:06:45,459 --> 04:06:48,659
There was nothing in between the moments.

3666
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:52,319
There were like probably four story beats in the game.

3667
04:06:52,319 --> 04:06:55,760
But the only thing you do between there is kind of you walk down the hall

3668
04:06:55,760 --> 04:06:57,440
and there's a piece of paper at the end.

3669
04:06:57,440 --> 04:06:59,360
And then the next thing happened.

3670
04:07:01,139 --> 04:07:03,299
Yeah, it was a lot of hallway walking.

3671
04:07:04,020 --> 04:07:08,659
And I mean, let's OK, here are the pros to this game.

3672
04:07:09,620 --> 04:07:12,020
It's very, very, very, very nice looking game.

3673
04:07:13,620 --> 04:07:17,700
I thought like the especially when they did when they did close ups,

3674
04:07:17,700 --> 04:07:21,059
I thought it was fucking fantastic graphics until they showed their teeth.

3675
04:07:22,399 --> 04:07:26,559
I didn't dislike any of the actual actors or the voice actors.

3676
04:07:26,559 --> 04:07:27,520
I thought that was all good.

3677
04:07:35,540 --> 04:07:35,860
Yeah.

3678
04:07:36,819 --> 04:07:41,299
Yeah, I was I was holding up to no comment and no response.

3679
04:07:42,100 --> 04:07:45,590
The graphics were fine.

3680
04:07:45,590 --> 04:07:51,920
Yeah, it was just kind of it was it was until dawn until dawn was so much better.

3681
04:07:51,920 --> 04:07:55,280
Like until dawn was five letter grades.

3682
04:07:55,280 --> 04:07:58,399
How come halfway through the game, there was a literal I am the captain now.

3683
04:07:58,959 --> 04:07:59,920
Look at me.

3684
04:07:59,920 --> 04:08:02,079
Yeah, I guess I am inevitable.

3685
04:08:03,680 --> 04:08:05,360
Yeah, I felt weird.

3686
04:08:06,579 --> 04:08:07,299
That did happen.

3687
04:08:10,260 --> 04:08:11,860
That did happen like more than once.

3688
04:08:12,420 --> 04:08:17,940
And there were a couple like dialogue options that just were out of nowhere.

3689
04:08:18,579 --> 04:08:22,049
What do you mean?

3690
04:08:24,760 --> 04:08:29,540
Mike, could you explain that again to me?

3691
04:08:29,540 --> 04:08:32,100
But in like not nerd terms, so I can understand.

3692
04:08:33,059 --> 04:08:39,520
And they would just I remember when you were like tonal shift, kind of weird, right?

3693
04:08:39,520 --> 04:08:43,200
Yeah, at least they said the name of the series.

3694
04:08:45,360 --> 04:08:45,920
Yeah, I did.

3695
04:08:45,920 --> 04:08:48,319
I did ruin Alex's proposal to Julia.

3696
04:08:48,879 --> 04:08:51,840
He proposed to Julia underwater when they were diving.

3697
04:08:51,840 --> 04:08:56,079
And I thought and I told him that he was being stupid.

3698
04:08:57,280 --> 04:08:57,680
Damn.

3699
04:09:01,430 --> 04:09:03,350
But that that's the end of that.

3700
04:09:04,069 --> 04:09:06,930
That's the end of the man of the Dan.

3701
04:09:12,209 --> 04:09:14,290
I haven't gone to the bathroom in four hours.

3702
04:09:14,290 --> 04:09:15,889
So and that's a first for me.

3703
04:09:17,270 --> 04:09:17,909
I'm going to go pee.

3704
04:09:22,469 --> 04:09:24,549
OK, I'll be back.

3705
04:09:26,709 --> 04:09:27,350
What time is it?

3706
04:09:28,229 --> 04:09:30,149
It's been about four hours.

3707
04:09:30,870 --> 04:09:32,319
I'm not sure there's anything else.

3708
04:09:32,319 --> 04:09:34,239
Is there anything else we can do for like an hour?

3709
04:09:37,940 --> 04:09:38,579
Maybe.

3710
04:09:39,860 --> 04:09:45,840
What was the point of the satanic book?

3711
04:09:45,840 --> 04:09:49,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3712
04:09:49,280 --> 04:09:50,799
No, that wasn't I wasn't full of shit there.

3713
04:09:50,799 --> 04:09:54,399
I found a Satan room with a Satan book and told me all these Satan spells.

3714
04:09:55,360 --> 04:09:56,879
Was it just a red herring?

3715
04:09:56,879 --> 04:09:58,479
I think it was just a hallucination.

3716
04:09:58,479 --> 04:10:00,000
Yeah, it was just that was not real.

3717
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:01,120
And I was making it all up.

3718
04:10:02,530 --> 04:10:04,770
See how fast you can kill everyone in the game.

3719
04:10:05,729 --> 04:10:09,569
You want to try to just kill everybody's faster again.

3720
04:10:09,569 --> 04:10:10,450
That's not a bad idea.

3721
04:10:11,409 --> 04:10:12,690
Just fail every QT.

3722
04:10:13,729 --> 04:10:15,489
Yeah, let's try to kill everybody as fast as possible.

3723
04:10:15,489 --> 04:10:15,969
See what happens.

3724
04:10:16,930 --> 04:10:17,170
All right.

3725
04:10:17,170 --> 04:10:18,049
Yeah, that's what we're going to do.

3726
04:10:18,850 --> 04:10:21,010
We're going to play the game again, but we're going to kill everyone

3727
04:10:21,010 --> 04:10:23,090
as soon as possible to try to do it in less than 30 minutes.

3728
04:10:24,049 --> 04:10:25,430
I'll be right back.

3729
04:10:25,430 --> 04:10:26,229
I'm going to go pee.

3730
04:10:26,229 --> 04:10:28,790
OK, I'll just mute you and everything.

3731
04:10:29,670 --> 04:10:35,799
I'll be right back as Pete.

3732
04:10:36,600 --> 04:12:41,319
Hello.

3733
04:12:42,920 --> 04:12:49,409
Hey, yeah, you get disconnected.

3734
04:12:51,170 --> 04:12:51,569
Did I?

3735
04:12:53,170 --> 04:12:53,969
Oh, we went down.

3736
04:12:56,530 --> 04:12:56,850
Yep.

3737
04:12:58,049 --> 04:13:01,680
I turned off the VEEP.

3738
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:03,520
So the VPN makes any difference.

3739
04:13:05,760 --> 04:13:07,920
Yeah, it looks like the VPN lost connection.

3740
04:13:09,170 --> 04:13:09,889
Huh.

3741
04:13:09,889 --> 04:13:11,590
Well, that's irritating.

3742
04:13:11,590 --> 04:13:48,959
But it's people saying it's Twitch.

3743
04:13:50,399 --> 04:13:53,170
People saying I don't believe it is.

3744
04:13:53,969 --> 04:13:55,409
But why would it be working?

3745
04:13:55,409 --> 04:13:56,690
We both went down at the same time.

3746
04:13:56,690 --> 04:13:58,850
It says people saying Twitch's servers are shitting the bed right now.

3747
04:13:58,850 --> 04:14:00,450
A bunch of streamers are going offline.

3748
04:14:01,649 --> 04:14:02,450
Maybe so.

3749
04:14:02,450 --> 04:14:02,930
Maybe that is.

3750
04:14:02,930 --> 04:14:04,129
Maybe it's not the VPN.

3751
04:14:04,129 --> 04:14:05,329
Either way, it's not Cox.

3752
04:14:06,209 --> 04:14:07,409
Yeah, it's not.

3753
04:14:07,409 --> 04:14:09,649
It's not an Internet issue, apparently.

3754
04:14:09,649 --> 04:14:10,129
For once.

3755
04:14:14,440 --> 04:14:15,479
It's Twitch, apparently.

3756
04:14:17,200 --> 04:14:21,239
OK, you ready to try this?

3757
04:14:21,239 --> 04:14:22,040
See if we can do this.

3758
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:25,959
I'm going to say we should start like halfway through the story.

3759
04:14:29,459 --> 04:14:32,579
Is it possible to skip like dialogue?

3760
04:14:32,579 --> 04:14:34,579
I'm assuming we can probably...

3761
04:14:36,739 --> 04:14:39,620
We can probably just go to the part where the boat gets...

3762
04:14:40,739 --> 04:14:44,819
Well, I think if we wanted to start from the beginning,

3763
04:14:44,819 --> 04:14:48,340
if you just don't look at anything other than the next objective,

3764
04:14:48,340 --> 04:14:51,299
doesn't that just throw the story into the next beat?

3765
04:14:52,930 --> 04:14:57,329
Because can't you fail a bunch of QTEs as the two sailors?

3766
04:14:58,930 --> 04:15:01,649
Can you start from the chapter after we do the punching

3767
04:15:02,610 --> 04:15:04,049
QTE and fortune?

3768
04:15:05,090 --> 04:15:06,129
That's what I'm saying.

3769
04:15:06,129 --> 04:15:08,129
Yeah, that's what we should just skip the prologue.

3770
04:15:08,930 --> 04:15:10,469
I got an invite for you.

3771
04:15:11,350 --> 04:15:16,629
A bunch of QTEs.

3772
04:15:16,629 --> 04:15:18,069
All right, so scene selection.

3773
04:15:19,680 --> 04:15:21,840
We've got Chinese market, the Duke.

3774
04:15:23,780 --> 04:15:26,500
So Chinese market, I believe, is...

3775
04:15:26,500 --> 04:15:27,219
This is all you.

3776
04:15:28,260 --> 04:15:29,479
The Duke is the boat.

3777
04:15:30,120 --> 04:15:33,479
So like we can't just skip that Chinese market part.

3778
04:15:34,040 --> 04:15:37,750
We have to start at that when we are on the boat.

3779
04:15:38,389 --> 04:15:41,780
Okay, we're just going to start at the Duke.

3780
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:42,739
And here we go.

3781
04:15:42,739 --> 04:15:43,540
Start the timer now.

3782
04:15:44,260 --> 04:15:50,690
Here we go.

3783
04:15:50,690 --> 04:16:02,719
All right, try to get as fast as we can.

3784
04:16:03,520 --> 04:16:10,120
Have everyone just say nothing.

3785
04:16:10,120 --> 04:16:11,479
Yeah, just only just don't talk.

3786
04:16:12,280 --> 04:16:20,420
I'm trying to skip.

3787
04:16:22,579 --> 04:16:24,799
Well, you've artificially...

3788
04:16:30,760 --> 04:16:31,879
All right, here come the beards.

3789
04:16:31,879 --> 04:16:38,120
Uh-oh, we got twitched.

3790
04:16:39,250 --> 04:16:39,809
Wait, we did?

3791
04:16:41,350 --> 04:16:41,829
Are you down?

3792
04:16:41,829 --> 04:16:42,389
Are you zero?

3793
04:16:43,350 --> 04:16:44,950
Yeah, I'm...

3794
04:16:44,950 --> 04:16:47,030
Oh, well, if you're not, then I guess we'll just keep going.

3795
04:16:47,030 --> 04:16:48,870
But it's getting kind of miserable.

3796
04:16:48,870 --> 04:16:50,629
Yeah, this might be like a...

3797
04:16:52,899 --> 04:16:54,020
This is making no sense.

3798
04:16:54,659 --> 04:16:59,680
Apparently, Twitch is just going down.

3799
04:17:00,399 --> 04:17:03,620
Because you're fine, right?

3800
04:17:03,620 --> 04:17:05,299
Yeah, I'm fine completely, like 100%.

3801
04:17:05,299 --> 04:17:06,260
Okay, so it's...

3802
04:17:06,260 --> 04:17:07,780
Are you on VPN right now?

3803
04:17:07,780 --> 04:17:08,020
No.

3804
04:17:08,659 --> 04:17:11,239
Me neither.

3805
04:17:11,799 --> 04:17:15,030
So, yeah, something's going on.

3806
04:17:15,030 --> 04:17:16,069
Who's DDoSing Twitch?

3807
04:17:16,629 --> 04:17:17,110
I don't know.

3808
04:17:17,110 --> 04:17:17,829
That's a good question.

3809
04:17:20,819 --> 04:17:22,739
Let's just try to get rid of this.

3810
04:17:22,739 --> 04:17:23,860
Yeah, well, the thing is I...

3811
04:17:24,739 --> 04:17:25,860
Oh, you're out of the game?

3812
04:17:25,860 --> 04:17:26,180
I'm...

3813
04:17:26,180 --> 04:17:29,379
No, I'm going to have to alt-tab in a second.

3814
04:17:30,020 --> 04:17:31,700
And that's going to force pause the game.

3815
04:17:32,340 --> 04:17:33,059
There's Alex.

3816
04:17:36,549 --> 04:17:37,829
I'm going to try changing servers.

3817
04:17:38,389 --> 04:17:42,389
Well, thankfully, this all started really happening when we finished the game.

3818
04:17:42,389 --> 04:17:42,629
Yes.

3819
04:17:43,270 --> 04:17:52,229
Think we got enough?

3820
04:17:52,229 --> 04:17:54,600
If we run out, we can always call for backup.

3821
04:17:54,600 --> 04:17:55,719
All right, say nothing.

3822
04:17:55,719 --> 04:17:58,879
So, look, I've never been down there before.

3823
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:00,559
All right, I got out water.

3824
04:18:01,680 --> 04:18:04,559
Don't blame me.

3825
04:18:05,120 --> 04:18:05,840
Blame Twitch.

3826
04:18:06,639 --> 04:18:08,319
No, no one's blaming you.

3827
04:18:08,959 --> 04:18:10,950
Don't worry.

3828
04:18:12,370 --> 04:18:13,090
I'm blaming me?

3829
04:18:14,370 --> 04:18:15,250
I want to see what happens.

3830
04:18:15,969 --> 04:18:21,510
Let me know when you're ready.

3831
04:18:21,510 --> 04:18:27,139
Are you playing different characters to see this stuff?

3832
04:18:27,780 --> 04:18:30,819
No, we're trying to see how fast we can have somebody die.

3833
04:18:33,120 --> 04:18:34,799
We're not going real fast.

3834
04:18:34,799 --> 04:18:37,280
We're going at lightning speed at the moment.

3835
04:18:43,670 --> 04:18:46,690
All right, let's try here.

3836
04:18:49,680 --> 04:18:51,280
You doing a new server?

3837
04:18:51,840 --> 04:18:52,079
Yeah.

3838
04:18:57,879 --> 04:19:00,100
Okay, try again.

3839
04:19:00,100 --> 04:19:05,270
Twitch TV server problems.

3840
04:19:05,829 --> 04:19:06,149
Ready.

3841
04:19:06,870 --> 04:19:09,729
Choose an EU server.

3842
04:19:09,729 --> 04:19:10,290
Diving.

3843
04:19:10,290 --> 04:19:11,489
Um, I don't know if we failed it.

3844
04:19:11,489 --> 04:19:12,850
Maybe you could show me how the pros are.

3845
04:19:13,090 --> 04:19:14,209
Up that high.

3846
04:19:21,540 --> 04:19:23,139
All right, say nothing.

3847
04:19:23,700 --> 04:19:24,100
Always.

3848
04:19:28,399 --> 04:19:31,040
Well, anyway, let's get this all loaded up.

3849
04:19:32,719 --> 04:19:34,319
I think he was going to say something there, too.

3850
04:19:34,319 --> 04:19:34,639
Careful.

3851
04:19:35,360 --> 04:19:38,159
That dive cam is like super expensive.

3852
04:19:38,159 --> 04:19:38,799
Be cool.

3853
04:19:38,799 --> 04:19:39,520
What?

3854
04:19:39,520 --> 04:19:42,879
Julia and Conrad are, you know, how do I say it?

3855
04:19:42,879 --> 04:19:44,159
Super fucking loaded.

3856
04:19:44,159 --> 04:19:44,879
So?

3857
04:19:44,879 --> 04:19:46,159
Don't sweat the little stuff, man.

3858
04:19:46,159 --> 04:19:46,879
It's not cool.

3859
04:19:47,680 --> 04:19:48,399
Don't make me regret.

3860
04:19:49,120 --> 04:19:54,979
Oh, cool.

3861
04:19:54,979 --> 04:19:58,850
Uh, is it a DDoS?

3862
04:19:58,850 --> 04:19:59,729
You tag along.

3863
04:19:59,729 --> 04:20:01,170
No, the internet's fine.

3864
04:20:01,170 --> 04:20:01,409
It's just...

3865
04:20:01,409 --> 04:20:07,489
Well, no, I'm done with the people saying that it is like up to Twitch or something.

3866
04:20:08,370 --> 04:20:09,989
All right, amigo.

3867
04:20:09,989 --> 04:20:10,870
Calvary's almost here.

3868
04:20:10,870 --> 04:20:11,590
Cool.

3869
04:20:11,590 --> 04:20:12,950
Sorry I'm a little snappy.

3870
04:20:12,950 --> 04:20:13,350
I'm just...

3871
04:20:14,389 --> 04:20:16,309
The new medical school would be stressful, you know?

3872
04:20:16,309 --> 04:20:17,190
Total shocker.

3873
04:20:17,190 --> 04:20:21,190
And man, the long distance thing, Julia, it's been rough.

3874
04:20:24,069 --> 04:20:25,350
Just random people saying that.

3875
04:20:25,430 --> 04:20:26,389
Yeah, well then I'm like...

3876
04:20:26,389 --> 04:20:27,430
Yeah, it's probably not, oh.

3877
04:20:31,840 --> 04:20:33,040
I'm just very shocked.

3878
04:20:34,559 --> 04:20:35,040
Me, too.

3879
04:20:36,399 --> 04:20:38,739
I guess I keep these in an underskills location.

3880
04:20:38,739 --> 04:20:39,239
Flushing.

3881
04:20:46,959 --> 04:20:51,059
Hey, so, uh, can I get your input on something?

3882
04:20:51,620 --> 04:20:52,579
Yeah, what?

3883
04:20:52,579 --> 04:20:56,610
Just, uh, kind of a big thing I'm trying to make a decision about.

3884
04:20:58,159 --> 04:20:59,680
About finishing med school?

3885
04:20:59,680 --> 04:21:00,479
And you said no.

3886
04:21:01,200 --> 04:21:05,120
So you were talking about wanting to do this and then down there you said no.

3887
04:21:06,020 --> 04:21:10,340
Imagine if him being in med school allowed him to solve anyone's

3888
04:21:10,340 --> 04:21:11,940
medical problems throughout this game.

3889
04:21:14,930 --> 04:21:19,649
Or if that character backstory was written, uh, after the rest of the game.

3890
04:21:20,450 --> 04:21:21,899
Teeth.

3891
04:21:22,440 --> 04:21:24,950
No one's figured it out yet.

3892
04:21:25,670 --> 04:21:35,520
Is this gonna take another three hours?

3893
04:21:35,520 --> 04:21:37,440
Um, I hope.

3894
04:21:37,440 --> 04:21:38,399
No, I hope not.

3895
04:21:38,399 --> 04:21:39,360
Hey, what's up, man?

3896
04:21:39,360 --> 04:21:39,860
Conrad.

3897
04:21:41,250 --> 04:21:41,969
Watch it, sis.

3898
04:21:42,690 --> 04:21:43,649
Lady killer, right here.

3899
04:21:44,690 --> 04:21:46,770
Good to finally meet you, Conrad.

3900
04:21:47,569 --> 04:21:48,709
This is Brad, by the way.

3901
04:21:48,709 --> 04:21:49,350
My little bro.

3902
04:21:49,909 --> 04:21:50,409
Hey.

3903
04:21:50,409 --> 04:21:51,430
Bradley!

3904
04:21:51,430 --> 04:21:53,909
Feel like I already know you have heard so much about ya.

3905
04:21:53,909 --> 04:21:57,190
All right, so remember, every dangerous potential scenario, uh,

3906
04:21:57,190 --> 04:22:00,149
do the option that is trying to get that person killed.

3907
04:22:01,190 --> 04:22:03,750
So is that Julia?

3908
04:22:04,549 --> 04:22:05,049
Yeah.

3909
04:22:05,350 --> 04:22:07,190
Is Julia blonde by the end of the game?

3910
04:22:07,190 --> 04:22:08,469
Geez, you have to think about it that hard.

3911
04:22:08,469 --> 04:22:09,110
She's blonde now?

3912
04:22:09,110 --> 04:22:09,989
I'm gonna guess the answer is no.

3913
04:22:10,950 --> 04:22:11,989
Maybe it's just the lighting.

3914
04:22:11,989 --> 04:22:13,110
First dive, you and me?

3915
04:22:14,790 --> 04:22:15,829
If you can keep up this time.

3916
04:22:22,840 --> 04:22:24,200
Whoa, whoa, cool down.

3917
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:25,559
Don't go crazy with excitement.

3918
04:22:27,000 --> 04:22:29,879
We'll both do it.

3919
04:22:29,879 --> 04:22:30,920
That's so funny.

3920
04:22:31,799 --> 04:22:35,319
What a boring, shitty play through this could be, if you really wanted it to be.

3921
04:22:36,360 --> 04:22:39,399
Yeah, absolutely no personality.

3922
04:22:39,399 --> 04:22:41,159
No personality, no decision making.

3923
04:22:41,799 --> 04:22:43,719
I like my main character's blank slate.

3924
04:22:43,719 --> 04:22:46,040
I like to put myself into their shoes.

3925
04:22:46,680 --> 04:22:57,440
I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but, uh,

3926
04:22:57,440 --> 04:23:02,500
so is everybody on board and ready to go?

3927
04:23:03,459 --> 04:23:07,809
So it turned out that she was full of shit.

3928
04:23:07,809 --> 04:23:09,809
About the, like, don't disturb dead people thing.

3929
04:23:10,530 --> 04:23:11,250
Oh, yeah.

3930
04:23:11,250 --> 04:23:12,450
You're selling, I'm buying.

3931
04:23:14,979 --> 04:23:17,239
They weren't cursed at all.

3932
04:23:17,239 --> 04:23:20,120
It was just the military miasma.

3933
04:23:28,739 --> 04:23:33,860
All right, when's the first scenario where everyone could just die?

3934
04:23:34,899 --> 04:23:37,860
Well, there's an underwater segment here in a second, isn't there?

3935
04:23:37,860 --> 04:23:38,420
There is, yeah.

3936
04:23:38,420 --> 04:23:40,020
And the barbecue explosions.

3937
04:23:42,120 --> 04:23:43,399
But you already messed that up.

3938
04:23:44,629 --> 04:23:45,590
Yeah, all right.

3939
04:23:45,590 --> 04:23:47,030
What's the fastest way we can get out of this?

3940
04:23:47,590 --> 04:23:49,750
Is just go say we're ready, right?

3941
04:23:49,750 --> 04:23:51,700
What about over here?

3942
04:23:52,500 --> 04:23:53,700
That's pretty far out of the way.

3943
04:23:54,340 --> 04:23:57,540
I'm currently scrolling through this iPad.

3944
04:23:57,540 --> 04:24:00,500
Listen, to be honest, I've never heard of this wreck you're looking for.

3945
04:24:00,500 --> 04:24:02,500
Usually these things are crawling with divers.

3946
04:24:02,500 --> 04:24:03,860
Well, how do you do that?

3947
04:24:03,860 --> 04:24:04,659
Look at this.

3948
04:24:04,659 --> 04:24:05,620
This one's different.

3949
04:24:05,620 --> 04:24:10,180
I'm just saying, if it gets too late, I know some nice places where you can just take, you know,

3950
04:24:10,180 --> 04:24:10,819
a nice dive.

3951
04:24:17,360 --> 04:24:18,719
Just think about it.

3952
04:24:18,719 --> 04:24:21,559
I'm gonna go help Conrad and Julia with the camera.

3953
04:24:21,559 --> 04:24:26,440
I'm just so slow to process all information.

3954
04:24:27,399 --> 04:24:33,760
Feast your eyes on this.

3955
04:24:34,479 --> 04:24:36,239
Whoa, hey, look at that.

3956
04:24:36,239 --> 04:24:36,879
What is it?

3957
04:24:36,879 --> 04:24:37,840
Looks like a bomber.

3958
04:24:37,840 --> 04:24:38,479
Can you zoom in?

3959
04:24:39,200 --> 04:24:41,600
Oh, yeah, definitely a B-29.

3960
04:24:41,600 --> 04:24:42,479
That's good, right?

3961
04:24:42,479 --> 04:24:43,360
Are kittens good?

3962
04:24:43,920 --> 04:24:45,200
Are miniature horses good?

3963
04:24:46,079 --> 04:24:47,600
Hey, I freaking nailed it, bro.

3964
04:24:47,600 --> 04:24:49,280
Don't I get a little end zone dance?

3965
04:24:49,920 --> 04:24:50,319
Watch me.

3966
04:24:50,959 --> 04:24:51,440
Oh, yeah.

3967
04:24:52,159 --> 04:24:52,639
Oh, yeah.

3968
04:24:54,639 --> 04:24:56,559
So the B-29 is a super fortress.

3969
04:24:58,239 --> 04:25:01,520
During World War II, they built these suckers to cruise at the highest altitude possible

3970
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:04,559
while maintaining the ability to carry nuclear warheads.

3971
04:25:04,559 --> 04:25:06,559
They were just, like, so dope.

3972
04:25:06,559 --> 04:25:07,920
Ah, so dope.

3973
04:25:07,920 --> 04:25:08,559
Oh, my God.

3974
04:25:09,920 --> 04:25:10,559
Look at me.

3975
04:25:10,559 --> 04:25:11,120
Sorry, yeah.

3976
04:25:11,760 --> 04:25:12,319
Look at me.

3977
04:25:13,360 --> 04:25:14,239
Please keep going.

3978
04:25:16,239 --> 04:25:17,920
Fliss, we found a plane.

3979
04:25:17,920 --> 04:25:18,319
Yeah?

3980
04:25:18,319 --> 04:25:20,000
Yeah, looks like World War II.

3981
04:25:20,000 --> 04:25:21,040
We are ready to dive.

3982
04:25:23,040 --> 04:25:27,600
Technically, we should call this in to port authorities as an unreported wreck.

3983
04:25:28,000 --> 04:25:28,639
Technically.

3984
04:25:29,920 --> 04:25:31,760
Are you sure you don't want to do this the right way?

3985
04:25:34,819 --> 04:25:37,059
Have a good think about that one before you respond.

3986
04:25:38,709 --> 04:25:39,989
Guys, no one knows.

3987
04:25:39,989 --> 04:25:40,950
No one cares.

3988
04:25:40,950 --> 04:25:41,989
No harm, no foul.

3989
04:25:41,989 --> 04:25:44,309
The computer is starting to answer for us.

3990
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:51,840
Look, we picked for this guy.

3991
04:25:51,840 --> 04:25:53,200
Generously, we're dying.

3992
04:25:53,200 --> 04:25:54,399
The AI has taken over.

3993
04:25:55,620 --> 04:25:57,540
They have to push the story along somehow.

3994
04:26:00,629 --> 04:26:02,149
Say nothing is an illusion.

3995
04:26:02,149 --> 04:26:03,270
Can you imagine?

3996
04:26:03,270 --> 04:26:03,909
Untouched?

3997
04:26:04,790 --> 04:26:07,350
I am going to do some reading up on B-29s.

3998
04:26:11,040 --> 04:26:16,870
So what happens if we don't control the game at all?

3999
04:26:19,270 --> 04:26:23,510
I tried that and eventually it just forced me to go to the next area.

4000
04:26:23,510 --> 04:26:25,030
I still don't know what happened.

4001
04:26:25,909 --> 04:26:27,030
I may have pulled you.

4002
04:26:27,030 --> 04:26:28,069
Maybe you should check on your bro.

4003
04:26:28,069 --> 04:26:30,149
Yeah, no, it was unexplainable.

4004
04:26:37,569 --> 04:26:38,290
Okay, we're gonna have to move.

4005
04:26:38,290 --> 04:26:40,530
We both just stood here for 10 full minutes.

4006
04:26:41,250 --> 04:26:43,719
Hold on, what's the thing that moves us along?

4007
04:26:44,120 --> 04:26:45,639
I think we have to go downstairs.

4008
04:26:47,479 --> 04:26:50,600
I have to go downstairs and then they call us back up.

4009
04:26:51,399 --> 04:26:54,870
Oh wait, no, you're down in that new cutscene area.

4010
04:26:54,870 --> 04:26:55,590
I can't go in there.

4011
04:26:56,149 --> 04:26:56,709
Oh yeah, I can.

4012
04:26:58,709 --> 04:27:03,379
Okay, here we go.

4013
04:27:10,149 --> 04:27:11,030
Yeah, I have to do this.

4014
04:27:11,430 --> 04:27:12,629
I don't know what's going on.

4015
04:27:26,049 --> 04:27:28,530
I feel like these, there's no...

4016
04:27:35,889 --> 04:27:37,329
It's like, oh, relationship updated.

4017
04:27:37,329 --> 04:27:39,649
You've seen that like a bunch of times in the top left of the screen, right?

4018
04:27:40,610 --> 04:27:41,649
Yeah, I don't know what it means.

4019
04:27:41,649 --> 04:27:42,610
What the fuck does that mean?

4020
04:27:43,889 --> 04:27:46,610
It's kind of like Alex will remember that.

4021
04:27:47,010 --> 04:27:49,170
Yeah, but they don't accept.

4022
04:27:49,170 --> 04:27:51,729
Maybe it only matters if you're a single player?

4023
04:27:51,729 --> 04:27:52,209
I don't know.

4024
04:27:53,010 --> 04:27:55,729
Because the AI has to control some of the reactions.

4025
04:27:58,340 --> 04:27:59,620
He's stoned out of his mind.

4026
04:28:00,340 --> 04:28:03,959
All right, here we go.

4027
04:28:04,680 --> 04:28:06,639
You can't go in there.

4028
04:28:06,639 --> 04:28:10,159
I know, but we have to like do all the random things and then she goes, tanks are ready.

4029
04:28:19,159 --> 04:28:25,250
See, okay, what is this, what is this a painting of?

4030
04:28:25,889 --> 04:28:27,809
This premonition here, is that just of the storm?

4031
04:28:29,459 --> 04:28:31,299
Where Brad is like, oh no.

4032
04:28:33,219 --> 04:28:41,219
Oh, yeah, it didn't have to be annoying.

4033
04:28:43,860 --> 04:28:55,170
All right, let's do it.

4034
04:28:57,329 --> 04:28:57,889
I'm doing it.

4035
04:29:00,850 --> 04:29:02,209
I'm doing it.

4036
04:29:02,209 --> 04:29:02,770
I'm doing it.

4037
04:29:08,399 --> 04:29:09,200
Literally none.

4038
04:29:13,520 --> 04:29:15,440
This may as well be striking in human.

4039
04:29:15,440 --> 04:29:18,879
I'm just an android that hasn't been programmed yet.

4040
04:29:20,799 --> 04:29:26,149
If she tries to keep me from doing this dive one more time, that's it, gloves off.

4041
04:29:26,149 --> 04:29:27,030
That's fair.

4042
04:29:27,030 --> 04:29:28,950
Just don't force her hand.

4043
04:29:30,309 --> 04:29:34,229
All right, I'm gonna get these rebreather set up and then we'll go through the final steps together.

4044
04:29:34,229 --> 04:29:36,309
Cool, just holler at us.

4045
04:29:36,309 --> 04:29:37,110
Nothing to say.

4046
04:29:40,159 --> 04:29:42,719
Do what you want.

4047
04:29:42,719 --> 04:29:44,399
You're not gonna listen to me anyways.

4048
04:29:45,120 --> 04:29:49,520
But if you take one thing from that wreck, you're gonna make us all criminals.

4049
04:29:53,909 --> 04:29:55,190
Relationship updated.

4050
04:29:58,870 --> 04:29:59,430
What about me?

4051
04:30:04,420 --> 04:30:06,020
Nobody ended up being a traitor.

4052
04:30:07,299 --> 04:30:10,500
Nobody got into any kind of relationship.

4053
04:30:11,459 --> 04:30:14,280
Well, the people were gonna get married, I guess, but.

4054
04:30:15,649 --> 04:30:18,690
Every time I take a group of you people out, it's the same thing.

4055
04:30:19,250 --> 04:30:21,170
No regard for anyone else's customs.

4056
04:30:21,889 --> 04:30:24,450
These rules are all pretty basic stuff.

4057
04:30:25,250 --> 04:30:28,049
How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?

4058
04:30:28,049 --> 04:30:29,729
Oh, shit, this is a hard one.

4059
04:30:31,329 --> 04:30:38,709
Like, if you're silent for this long, through this many questions, you might be a serial killer.

4060
04:30:39,430 --> 04:30:41,190
No, you just don't like fucking ask it.

4061
04:30:41,190 --> 04:30:43,430
For all you know, this could be a war grave.

4062
04:30:44,309 --> 04:30:46,549
Disturbing it would be illegal and immoral.

4063
04:30:52,079 --> 04:30:55,360
They just said to cool it with your desperate pickup bullshit.

4064
04:30:55,360 --> 04:30:58,319
I haven't said a word as Conrad the entire game.

4065
04:30:58,319 --> 04:30:59,840
Just respect the rules down there.

4066
04:30:59,840 --> 04:31:02,239
Don't do anything stupid that'll get my ass in trouble.

4067
04:31:05,360 --> 04:31:07,440
I haven't said anything.

4068
04:31:07,440 --> 04:31:08,319
No, nothing.

4069
04:31:09,680 --> 04:31:11,520
Hey, at least I'm honest.

4070
04:31:11,520 --> 04:31:12,159
Still gross.

4071
04:31:13,040 --> 04:31:14,399
All right, are we ready to go in?

4072
04:31:15,520 --> 04:31:17,809
He's so desperate, he said nothing.

4073
04:32:03,270 --> 04:32:05,110
I'm standing next to you.

4074
04:32:05,110 --> 04:32:08,709
I'm standing right next to you, like, as if I can see as far as you.

4075
04:32:08,709 --> 04:32:10,629
There's nothing to even find out here.

4076
04:32:12,479 --> 04:32:13,120
Maybe there is.

4077
04:32:13,920 --> 04:32:14,719
This is freaking me out.

4078
04:32:14,719 --> 04:32:15,680
What the fuck?

4079
04:32:15,680 --> 04:32:24,760
I just got a little oopsie.

4080
04:32:25,399 --> 04:32:27,440
Oh, are you?

4081
04:32:28,079 --> 04:32:28,399
What?

4082
04:32:29,750 --> 04:32:31,430
Oh, you just you just like took me out of it.

4083
04:32:33,280 --> 04:32:34,639
Well, I was in a trance.

4084
04:32:34,639 --> 04:32:37,360
Just the camera zoomed in on my face and I just took I had it was in a trance.

4085
04:32:42,450 --> 04:32:43,409
Are you up?

4086
04:32:43,409 --> 04:32:44,209
Oh, yeah, I'm up.

4087
04:32:45,010 --> 04:32:48,600
Oh, at this point, I've got a bit of it happens.

4088
04:32:48,600 --> 04:32:49,079
It happens.

4089
04:32:49,079 --> 04:32:52,370
They just go, you know what I'm saying?

4090
04:32:53,250 --> 04:32:57,670
Do I not press A?

4091
04:32:57,670 --> 04:32:58,149
What's going on?

4092
04:32:58,149 --> 04:32:59,030
What is going on?

4093
04:32:59,989 --> 04:33:02,979
Jerma has to talk to Julia.

4094
04:33:02,979 --> 04:33:06,020
Okay, so this is the rebreather.

4095
04:33:06,020 --> 04:33:08,580
Way cooler than a regular scuba setup.

4096
04:33:08,580 --> 04:33:12,020
It takes all that CO2 that you normally just exhale into the water.

4097
04:33:12,020 --> 04:33:14,340
And instead, it gets totally reused.

4098
04:33:14,340 --> 04:33:16,580
Then it reduces decompression time on your way up.

4099
04:33:17,220 --> 04:33:17,939
State of the art.

4100
04:33:19,459 --> 04:33:21,380
You guys are going to enter the game world.

4101
04:33:21,380 --> 04:33:22,340
Maybe done.

4102
04:33:23,380 --> 04:33:27,599
Yeah, we're not going down at the same time.

4103
04:33:27,599 --> 04:33:30,319
So if you have the squad stream open, no one's missing anything.

4104
04:33:31,680 --> 04:33:33,680
Oh, yeah, just good old squad stream.

4105
04:33:38,000 --> 04:33:39,360
Ready to take the plunge?

4106
04:33:39,360 --> 04:33:40,319
Oh, hey, guys.

4107
04:33:40,959 --> 04:33:42,639
What? Jesus, why are you so loud?

4108
04:33:42,639 --> 04:33:43,919
I almost completely forgot.

4109
04:33:43,919 --> 04:33:47,119
When I was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail.

4110
04:33:47,119 --> 04:33:48,959
I probably should put like a disclaimer somewhere,

4111
04:33:48,959 --> 04:33:52,799
like on this top of the stream that just says this is a fuck face run.

4112
04:33:52,799 --> 04:33:53,840
Okay, you little clown.

4113
04:33:53,840 --> 04:33:56,400
Someone has definitely come in here.

4114
04:33:56,400 --> 04:33:57,439
You behave, Connie.

4115
04:33:57,439 --> 04:33:58,080
Like, oh, good.

4116
04:33:58,080 --> 04:33:59,040
I got here just in time.

4117
04:33:59,040 --> 04:33:59,680
We just started.

4118
04:34:00,799 --> 04:34:02,080
Can't wait to see what they do next.

4119
04:34:03,650 --> 04:34:04,450
Say nothing.

4120
04:34:04,450 --> 04:34:05,569
I'm not taking any of this stuff.

4121
04:34:15,040 --> 04:34:16,560
And now I have nothing to say.

4122
04:34:20,119 --> 04:34:21,159
I'm so high.

4123
04:34:23,799 --> 04:34:24,599
God, come on.

4124
04:34:26,599 --> 04:34:28,919
These two are baked out of their minds.

4125
04:34:28,919 --> 04:34:31,479
This is just like, we like...

4126
04:34:31,479 --> 04:34:32,520
It just husks.

4127
04:34:34,709 --> 04:34:35,349
Oh, shit.

4128
04:34:35,349 --> 04:34:36,069
What should I do?

4129
04:34:42,659 --> 04:34:44,500
You're not in a good state to go down there.

4130
04:34:45,540 --> 04:34:47,220
No, you shouldn't be going down here.

4131
04:34:55,119 --> 04:35:00,389
All right, so there's a moment in the plane

4132
04:35:01,590 --> 04:35:03,110
when I take off the rebreather.

4133
04:35:04,069 --> 04:35:07,430
And swim into a cramped location.

4134
04:35:08,310 --> 04:35:11,750
But there's a QTE, so I want to see if that does anything.

4135
04:35:12,310 --> 04:35:12,950
I think...

4136
04:35:12,950 --> 04:35:13,830
You're Conrad.

4137
04:35:15,909 --> 04:35:16,630
I'm underwater.

4138
04:35:16,630 --> 04:35:17,750
You're on grill duty.

4139
04:35:17,750 --> 04:35:18,229
Wait, what?

4140
04:35:19,669 --> 04:35:21,669
I mean, I'm seeing the underwater segment.

4141
04:35:22,869 --> 04:35:24,229
You just Conrad and wasn't I, Alex?

4142
04:35:24,790 --> 04:35:26,310
Yeah, we got swabbed last time, though.

4143
04:35:26,310 --> 04:35:27,590
Did we get switched again here?

4144
04:35:28,389 --> 04:35:33,590
Howdy, Captain.

4145
04:35:33,590 --> 04:35:33,990
No, I'm...

4146
04:35:34,630 --> 04:35:36,389
Oh, yeah, it did swap us.

4147
04:35:36,389 --> 04:35:39,430
You are not my second-in-command, third-in-command.

4148
04:35:39,430 --> 04:35:39,750
No.

4149
04:35:39,750 --> 04:35:40,950
Fresh and eager cabin boy.

4150
04:35:40,950 --> 04:35:41,830
Still a no.

4151
04:35:41,830 --> 04:35:45,029
You're well-paying dashingly handsome seafaring client.

4152
04:35:45,029 --> 04:35:48,150
It's requesting the pleasure of your company over a frosty amber liquid.

4153
04:35:49,909 --> 04:35:53,169
Oh, she's been infected.

4154
04:35:54,580 --> 04:35:55,080
Okay.

4155
04:35:55,779 --> 04:35:56,819
You snooze, you lose.

4156
04:35:57,700 --> 04:36:00,610
Pretty nice ride you got here.

4157
04:36:01,169 --> 04:36:01,970
Where'd you get the cash?

4158
04:36:02,849 --> 04:36:05,319
I feel like it'd be cool for a game about choices

4159
04:36:05,319 --> 04:36:07,240
to give you a choice as to who you want to be.

4160
04:36:07,959 --> 04:36:08,840
That's true, yeah.

4161
04:36:08,840 --> 04:36:10,759
Sorry, I overstepped my bounds.

4162
04:36:10,759 --> 04:36:11,319
Switch computers.

4163
04:36:11,319 --> 04:36:13,240
We just take turns, each chapter,

4164
04:36:14,360 --> 04:36:15,959
choosing which squad to go with.

4165
04:36:16,599 --> 04:36:17,240
You know what?

4166
04:36:17,240 --> 04:36:20,119
I better spend some time keeping the Duke of Milan shipshape.

4167
04:36:20,119 --> 04:36:22,919
I really hope that I can just burn the boat down.

4168
04:36:23,720 --> 04:36:24,759
It's not gonna happen, though.

4169
04:36:24,759 --> 04:36:26,360
I'm gonna get stepped over.

4170
04:36:27,560 --> 04:36:29,000
I'm gonna get stepped over.

4171
04:36:30,040 --> 04:36:35,240
It's gonna happen anyways.

4172
04:36:44,759 --> 04:36:46,529
That is not your everyday wreck.

4173
04:36:47,090 --> 04:36:48,930
I hope those clowns don't get me in trouble.

4174
04:36:48,930 --> 04:36:51,490
Well, I just gotta cut on my leg and tetanus, so...

4175
04:36:51,650 --> 04:36:52,450
No, put it down.

4176
04:36:57,939 --> 04:36:58,500
Hey there.

4177
04:36:58,500 --> 04:37:03,380
How's it hanging?

4178
04:37:04,419 --> 04:37:04,979
I get it.

4179
04:37:04,979 --> 04:37:11,650
Busy, busy, busy.

4180
04:37:12,369 --> 04:37:14,610
You can monitor the dive while I do some boat maintenance.

4181
04:37:14,610 --> 04:37:15,490
Not a prob, Bob.

4182
04:37:16,849 --> 04:37:17,569
Okay, whatever.

4183
04:37:17,569 --> 04:37:24,479
Can we take a second to say that it's weird

4184
04:37:25,840 --> 04:37:30,599
that to play multiplayer, you don't pick multiplayer,

4185
04:37:30,599 --> 04:37:32,360
you pick not alone?

4186
04:37:32,840 --> 04:37:33,959
Yeah, that is weird.

4187
04:37:34,680 --> 04:37:38,319
It's like they know that we're real gamers.

4188
04:37:38,319 --> 04:37:39,439
Here comes like a storm.

4189
04:37:39,439 --> 04:37:42,849
Why do I say weather looks clear?

4190
04:37:42,849 --> 04:37:44,209
Why do I say weather looks clear?

4191
04:37:45,009 --> 04:37:46,450
I have to keep an eye on those clouds.

4192
04:37:46,450 --> 04:37:47,490
Hey, the weather looks clear.

4193
04:37:47,490 --> 04:37:49,970
It doesn't like a storm come.

4194
04:37:49,970 --> 04:37:51,490
It's getting mighty crowded out here.

4195
04:37:52,610 --> 04:37:54,159
Wait, did we even do the thing?

4196
04:37:58,500 --> 04:37:59,939
Did you do the barbecue yet?

4197
04:38:01,000 --> 04:38:01,799
Did I?

4198
04:38:01,799 --> 04:38:03,159
No, no, I'm just...

4199
04:38:03,159 --> 04:38:03,880
I now have to...

4200
04:38:06,209 --> 04:38:07,409
I'm swimming with the fishes.

4201
04:38:07,409 --> 04:38:08,290
I got no mask on

4202
04:38:08,290 --> 04:38:10,290
and I'm not gonna be pushing any buttons here.

4203
04:38:11,009 --> 04:38:15,330
Where's the boat?

4204
04:38:15,330 --> 04:38:15,889
I just saw it.

4205
04:38:16,450 --> 04:38:24,069
What the fuck is going on?

4206
04:38:24,069 --> 04:38:24,569
Three?

4207
04:38:33,959 --> 04:38:34,520
What happened?

4208
04:38:35,840 --> 04:38:38,880
Did you go make popcorn during the segment where she's drowning?

4209
04:38:39,439 --> 04:38:42,319
Are you doing something here?

4210
04:38:42,319 --> 04:38:43,840
Well, I hope that she was gonna die,

4211
04:38:43,840 --> 04:38:45,520
but no, she's actually fine.

4212
04:38:47,430 --> 04:38:49,590
I have no control over the game right now.

4213
04:38:49,590 --> 04:38:53,270
There were three separate failed QTEs to get out of this pipe,

4214
04:38:56,580 --> 04:38:57,459
which I feel like is...

4215
04:38:58,259 --> 04:38:58,979
I can't get up.

4216
04:39:03,840 --> 04:39:05,040
B doesn't do anything.

4217
04:39:05,040 --> 04:39:06,319
I haven't pressed B.

4218
04:39:06,319 --> 04:39:06,959
What did I do?

4219
04:39:10,580 --> 04:39:11,380
Okay, italics.

4220
04:39:11,380 --> 04:39:13,540
I think you need to like come press QB.

4221
04:39:13,540 --> 04:39:14,659
Do I need to do something?

4222
04:39:18,369 --> 04:39:19,490
Yeah, I'm stuck.

4223
04:39:19,490 --> 04:39:20,450
I'm looking just at the front of the boat.

4224
04:39:20,450 --> 04:39:21,729
I'm going as fast as I can.

4225
04:39:34,340 --> 04:39:36,099
It actually needed to wait for you.

4226
04:39:37,959 --> 04:39:39,000
How dare you talk?

4227
04:39:40,200 --> 04:39:44,279
I was silent last time when I played the real game.

4228
04:39:47,799 --> 04:39:49,479
Don't they come board?

4229
04:39:49,479 --> 04:39:50,360
What's going on here?

4230
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:52,680
Where's your like boat friends?

4231
04:39:52,680 --> 04:39:53,639
Hello again, little blip.

4232
04:39:54,520 --> 04:39:56,040
What you doing all the way out here?

4233
04:39:57,240 --> 04:40:06,340
They said italics is breaking character.

4234
04:40:07,880 --> 04:40:09,720
I did say something.

4235
04:40:09,720 --> 04:40:11,159
I chose a dialogue option,

4236
04:40:11,880 --> 04:40:15,919
but I was silent when we played the actual game.

4237
04:40:23,110 --> 04:40:23,830
There's nothing here.

4238
04:40:23,830 --> 04:40:24,869
Okay, I'm being a good boy.

4239
04:40:24,869 --> 04:40:26,950
There's nobody here.

4240
04:40:26,950 --> 04:40:33,360
Hey, don't worry about it.

4241
04:40:33,360 --> 04:40:33,919
I'm a people person.

4242
04:40:33,919 --> 04:40:35,119
If you could just pull that open,

4243
04:40:35,119 --> 04:40:37,279
why was I going to shimmy it with a knife?

4244
04:40:37,279 --> 04:40:38,080
Maybe they're fishermen.

4245
04:40:39,270 --> 04:40:40,150
Maybe that's their buoy.

4246
04:40:41,520 --> 04:40:41,840
Maybe...

4247
04:40:47,119 --> 04:40:47,680
Got to chat.

4248
04:40:53,299 --> 04:40:55,619
We won 100%, not 98%.

4249
04:40:56,580 --> 04:40:57,700
Oh, I'm so sorry.

4250
04:40:58,340 --> 04:41:00,259
Do they...

4251
04:41:00,819 --> 04:41:02,500
All right, I'm getting ready to break the ship.

4252
04:41:02,500 --> 04:41:03,540
So that should be your cue.

4253
04:41:04,520 --> 04:41:05,799
Okay, you're breaking the ship.

4254
04:41:07,520 --> 04:41:08,479
I'm breaking the plane.

4255
04:41:09,200 --> 04:41:16,020
All right, hold on.

4256
04:41:16,020 --> 04:41:16,659
Don't do it yet.

4257
04:41:26,610 --> 04:41:28,130
Okay, you just did it.

4258
04:41:28,130 --> 04:41:28,930
All right.

4259
04:41:28,930 --> 04:41:30,209
Well, I'm going to zero.

4260
04:41:30,209 --> 04:41:34,950
So they got me.

4261
04:41:34,950 --> 04:41:35,669
What's that about?

4262
04:41:36,229 --> 04:41:39,479
Wait, didn't we just do this?

4263
04:41:40,279 --> 04:41:42,919
I guess I haven't...

4264
04:41:42,919 --> 04:41:47,009
They're like coming right over to it.

4265
04:41:50,040 --> 04:41:50,840
Oh, this...

4266
04:41:50,840 --> 04:41:51,479
I don't think this...

4267
04:41:53,159 --> 04:41:54,360
Did that happen last time?

4268
04:42:00,680 --> 04:42:01,479
They just take off.

4269
04:42:01,479 --> 04:42:02,360
They don't even stop.

4270
04:42:03,750 --> 04:42:04,790
Yeah, this happened last time.

4271
04:42:04,790 --> 04:42:04,950
Yeah.

4272
04:42:08,639 --> 04:42:10,000
I thought I broke the plane.

4273
04:42:22,369 --> 04:42:22,770
20.

4274
04:42:23,409 --> 04:42:24,290
No, make it 30.

4275
04:42:26,130 --> 04:42:27,009
More like 40.

4276
04:42:32,610 --> 04:42:35,200
You know, I think this whole thing could have been

4277
04:42:35,200 --> 04:42:38,720
avoided if you had just handed this person the money.

4278
04:42:40,709 --> 04:42:42,099
You know what I mean?

4279
04:42:42,099 --> 04:42:45,220
Like, hey, come over here and let me hand you the money.

4280
04:42:45,220 --> 04:42:46,259
I guess they didn't need the money.

4281
04:42:46,900 --> 04:42:48,580
That could have been like, hey, I really want to pay for this.

4282
04:42:48,580 --> 04:42:49,459
I'm really like that.

4283
04:42:49,459 --> 04:42:50,659
That was like, yeah, I'm sorry.

4284
04:42:51,860 --> 04:42:54,130
Hello.

4285
04:42:54,130 --> 04:42:56,500
You going a little brain trip there, Flissy?

4286
04:42:57,220 --> 04:42:59,060
Here a piece of work, Conrad.

4287
04:42:59,060 --> 04:42:59,700
I'm not all work.

4288
04:43:01,479 --> 04:43:02,759
Are you trying to flirt with me?

4289
04:43:03,639 --> 04:43:04,520
Is it working?

4290
04:43:04,520 --> 04:43:05,880
I don't even know what it is.

4291
04:43:06,520 --> 04:43:08,200
Well, when you think of something,

4292
04:43:08,279 --> 04:43:10,200
I'll just be over here taking in the view,

4293
04:43:10,200 --> 04:43:12,279
flirting up a storm, hashtag wink.

4294
04:43:12,279 --> 04:43:12,759
All right.

4295
04:43:12,759 --> 04:43:14,520
I have to put a disclaimer on the top of the stream.

4296
04:43:15,799 --> 04:43:16,759
Guys, hold on.

4297
04:43:17,319 --> 04:43:22,709
I didn't do enough in my playthrough to get proposed to this time.

4298
04:43:22,709 --> 04:43:23,750
He doesn't like me anymore.

4299
04:43:24,389 --> 04:43:35,159
Well, I got to write, like, he doesn't like me.

4300
04:43:35,159 --> 04:43:38,119
Somehow it feels worse than saying no to a marriage proposal

4301
04:43:38,119 --> 04:43:40,119
is knowing that they were going to propose,

4302
04:43:40,119 --> 04:43:43,560
but you did something and now they're not going to.

4303
04:43:44,360 --> 04:43:45,250
It feels bad, man.

4304
04:43:46,840 --> 04:43:47,799
This has to be up here.

4305
04:43:51,459 --> 04:43:54,979
Wait, it's going to be one word, not two words.

4306
04:43:57,459 --> 04:43:58,819
It has to be one word.

4307
04:44:01,299 --> 04:44:02,659
This is not.

4308
04:44:02,659 --> 04:44:03,459
Okay, there.

4309
04:44:03,459 --> 04:44:04,020
That's better.

4310
04:44:04,580 --> 04:44:09,220
What are you trying to type?

4311
04:44:09,220 --> 04:44:10,099
I did.

4312
04:44:10,099 --> 04:44:10,900
It's not important.

4313
04:44:14,319 --> 04:44:15,919
By the way, as to the missing text,

4314
04:44:15,919 --> 04:44:17,919
I did have Discord open the entire stream.

4315
04:44:17,919 --> 04:44:19,599
So if you could just typed it, I would have seen.

4316
04:44:21,220 --> 04:44:23,520
Oh, well, I'm fucking stupid.

4317
04:44:23,520 --> 04:44:24,319
Don't worry.

4318
04:44:24,319 --> 04:44:31,119
Okay, I think they're on their way back up.

4319
04:44:31,119 --> 04:44:32,959
And I was getting used to it just being you and me.

4320
04:44:32,959 --> 04:44:33,840
We need to light the grill.

4321
04:44:33,840 --> 04:44:34,479
Oh, pick me.

4322
04:44:36,080 --> 04:44:37,279
Grill Capitan.

4323
04:44:37,279 --> 04:44:42,000
You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.

4324
04:44:42,000 --> 04:44:42,639
Here we go.

4325
04:44:48,759 --> 04:44:49,240
Let's see.

4326
04:44:50,680 --> 04:44:52,360
Oh, I have to make a decision this time.

4327
04:44:58,130 --> 04:44:58,689
You have to go.

4328
04:45:00,389 --> 04:45:01,750
I have to make a choice to try to kill.

4329
04:45:06,209 --> 04:45:06,930
Yeah, of course.

4330
04:45:12,610 --> 04:45:13,970
Damn, I'm sorry.

4331
04:45:16,150 --> 04:45:18,069
So what's the easiest way to kill anybody?

4332
04:45:18,069 --> 04:45:19,750
Why is it just looking sad at him?

4333
04:45:22,319 --> 04:45:23,119
Nothing happened.

4334
04:45:24,360 --> 04:45:26,040
Okay, fail every quick time event.

4335
04:45:26,040 --> 04:45:27,639
This is where it happens.

4336
04:45:29,479 --> 04:45:30,520
Have you not been doing that?

4337
04:45:31,240 --> 04:45:32,360
I've only gotten one chance.

4338
04:45:33,639 --> 04:45:46,020
Why was there only one explosion?

4339
04:45:46,020 --> 04:45:48,419
I just had a little trouble firing up the grill.

4340
04:45:49,220 --> 04:45:59,159
Conrad?

4341
04:45:59,159 --> 04:45:59,639
Whatever.

4342
04:45:59,639 --> 04:46:01,240
It's like they're seeing shit.

4343
04:46:01,240 --> 04:46:03,720
They say a sentence and then they like just get lost.

4344
04:46:03,720 --> 04:46:05,959
Like super, like in their own head.

4345
04:46:06,919 --> 04:46:10,759
Yeah, it's like, unfortunately, we did not leave it as pristine.

4346
04:46:10,759 --> 04:46:11,799
My great aunt.

4347
04:46:11,799 --> 04:46:12,040
What?

4348
04:46:12,759 --> 04:46:13,799
What's wrong with you?

4349
04:46:13,799 --> 04:46:14,520
With dementia.

4350
04:46:15,400 --> 04:46:18,439
Oh, that's a cool looking thing up in the sky.

4351
04:46:19,000 --> 04:46:21,240
There's no cockpit anymore for starters.

4352
04:46:21,240 --> 04:46:22,919
Well, that's just fucking perfect.

4353
04:46:29,650 --> 04:46:30,049
All right.

4354
04:46:30,849 --> 04:46:31,409
It's time.

4355
04:46:32,529 --> 04:46:34,689
No, everybody survived.

4356
04:46:34,689 --> 04:46:35,810
Weirdly enough.

4357
04:46:35,810 --> 04:46:38,770
I don't know how it's possible when it's not possible.

4358
04:46:38,770 --> 04:46:39,650
Got you a wink.

4359
04:46:43,189 --> 04:46:44,869
Yeah, I noticed you haven't been saying anything.

4360
04:46:44,869 --> 04:46:47,349
There's no these intrepid adventurers then.

4361
04:46:47,430 --> 04:46:51,349
Alex and his little brother Brad trying to swim with the big fish.

4362
04:46:52,229 --> 04:46:54,389
Both seem out of their debt.

4363
04:46:55,270 --> 04:46:56,000
He just looked down.

4364
04:46:56,000 --> 04:46:57,439
That was a scripted line.

4365
04:46:57,439 --> 04:46:58,799
He read that.

4366
04:46:58,799 --> 04:47:00,080
His script is in the book.

4367
04:47:00,080 --> 04:47:01,360
And he the love of hers.

4368
04:47:02,000 --> 04:47:03,520
That was a really good line.

4369
04:47:03,520 --> 04:47:04,479
He didn't write.

4370
04:47:04,479 --> 04:47:06,080
A bold fellow, you might say.

4371
04:47:07,119 --> 04:47:09,680
Or maybe you'd say arrogant.

4372
04:47:09,680 --> 04:47:16,040
And there's Captain Fliss, strong, forthright, stubborn.

4373
04:47:17,000 --> 04:47:21,560
She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms.

4374
04:47:21,560 --> 04:47:22,599
So far, at least.

4375
04:47:23,639 --> 04:47:25,889
Let me reassure you.

4376
04:47:25,889 --> 04:47:28,130
Let's get his head to make some decisions.

4377
04:47:28,130 --> 04:47:29,569
They'll value later on.

4378
04:47:30,770 --> 04:47:34,529
And so I failed to stream cutie and regret zero.

4379
04:47:34,529 --> 04:47:34,849
Really?

4380
04:47:35,810 --> 04:47:37,409
It hasn't happened to me since the last time.

4381
04:47:39,590 --> 04:47:40,950
Well, but we're not on the same server, though.

4382
04:47:40,950 --> 04:47:41,909
You're going somewhere else, right?

4383
04:47:42,470 --> 04:47:52,880
Well, preserved was the plane.

4384
04:47:52,880 --> 04:47:54,240
Pretty much what you'd expect.

4385
04:47:54,400 --> 04:47:55,520
Oh, we get the beers.

4386
04:47:55,520 --> 04:47:56,000
It was insane.

4387
04:47:56,000 --> 04:47:57,520
It was like traveling through time.

4388
04:47:57,520 --> 04:47:58,000
No shit.

4389
04:47:58,000 --> 04:47:58,240
Hold on.

4390
04:47:59,119 --> 04:48:00,720
I'm gonna change it again.

4391
04:48:00,720 --> 04:48:04,000
We get the beers and we sit around and we do a beer thing.

4392
04:48:11,939 --> 04:48:12,659
Brewskis.

4393
04:48:20,080 --> 04:48:20,400
Action.

4394
04:48:23,669 --> 04:48:24,950
Silent, scary story.

4395
04:48:24,950 --> 04:48:25,450
Incoming.

4396
04:48:30,369 --> 04:48:33,889
Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension

4397
04:48:33,889 --> 04:48:38,049
where the past is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles and sharks.

4398
04:48:38,049 --> 04:48:38,770
Sharks?

4399
04:48:38,770 --> 04:48:39,729
It was a gray reef.

4400
04:48:40,849 --> 04:48:42,930
Hey, I thought it was pretty intense.

4401
04:48:43,009 --> 04:48:45,970
Wasn't Conrad going to get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?

4402
04:48:46,930 --> 04:48:49,169
Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some.

4403
04:48:49,169 --> 04:48:50,450
And then he got drunk.

4404
04:48:50,450 --> 04:48:52,770
And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.

4405
04:48:52,770 --> 04:48:54,770
And he just kept on drinking and he drank all of it.

4406
04:48:54,770 --> 04:48:56,529
I can't wait to hear your scary story.

4407
04:48:56,529 --> 04:48:57,650
This kind of phenomenon.

4408
04:48:57,650 --> 04:48:59,090
Oh, that's right.

4409
04:48:59,090 --> 04:49:00,369
I'll go look for him.

4410
04:49:00,369 --> 04:49:02,130
I didn't even I forgot about that.

4411
04:49:03,330 --> 04:49:05,250
That's going to be a terrible story.

4412
04:49:05,810 --> 04:49:06,849
It's going to be a good one.

4413
04:49:06,849 --> 04:49:07,349
Yeah.

4414
04:49:12,159 --> 04:49:12,659
You're right.

4415
04:49:15,720 --> 04:49:18,470
So which one is?

4416
04:49:18,470 --> 04:49:19,029
Oh, God.

4417
04:49:19,029 --> 04:49:20,069
What's going on?

4418
04:49:20,069 --> 04:49:21,750
You know, where the magic.

4419
04:49:21,750 --> 04:49:23,830
This is giving me secondhand anxiety.

4420
04:49:24,709 --> 04:49:34,919
OK, that's enough of that.

4421
04:49:34,919 --> 04:49:35,799
You get them beers?

4422
04:49:36,360 --> 04:49:37,560
Oh, yeah, the beers.

4423
04:49:38,439 --> 04:49:39,319
I was just getting them now.

4424
04:49:42,599 --> 04:49:44,759
Why is it so much better like this?

4425
04:49:45,799 --> 04:49:47,000
It's not working.

4426
04:49:47,000 --> 04:49:55,939
This game becomes like a letter grade higher with the do nothing road.

4427
04:49:59,400 --> 04:49:59,900
Yeah.

4428
04:50:00,360 --> 04:50:03,080
Now that everybody's here, let's take a look at the navigators.

4429
04:50:03,080 --> 04:50:05,240
Boyfriend was trying to understand my inner thought.

4430
04:50:06,119 --> 04:50:06,840
Where did you put it?

4431
04:50:06,840 --> 04:50:07,639
It's in your case.

4432
04:50:07,639 --> 04:50:08,919
OK, I'll go get it.

4433
04:50:08,919 --> 04:50:10,360
If I say he did not find them.

4434
04:50:11,400 --> 04:50:15,939
You got the map pad dive master?

4435
04:50:15,939 --> 04:50:16,500
Yeah, I got it.

4436
04:50:16,500 --> 04:50:17,459
I have to know guys.

4437
04:50:17,459 --> 04:50:21,700
I have to say that I'm going to talk because I have to tell the story.

4438
04:50:22,259 --> 04:50:22,880
All right.

4439
04:50:22,880 --> 04:50:26,880
I'm just going to like stop here because you done again as well.

4440
04:50:26,880 --> 04:50:27,380
Yeah.

4441
04:50:27,919 --> 04:50:28,419
What?

4442
04:50:29,680 --> 04:50:32,880
Julia, I'm just trying to have a type web server.

4443
04:50:32,880 --> 04:50:34,560
You're on mind to me in this court.

4444
04:50:35,599 --> 04:50:36,159
Oh, shit.

4445
04:50:37,990 --> 04:50:38,869
Oh, my God.

4446
04:50:38,869 --> 04:50:39,509
Fine.

4447
04:50:39,509 --> 04:50:41,400
Let's go and get the pad together then.

4448
04:50:42,439 --> 04:50:43,319
Keep saying nothing.

4449
04:50:51,729 --> 04:50:53,090
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

4450
04:50:58,159 --> 04:50:58,639
Fine.

4451
04:50:58,639 --> 04:50:59,520
We'll go with the pad.

4452
04:50:59,520 --> 04:51:01,119
Wait, did I just ruin everything?

4453
04:51:02,470 --> 04:51:04,389
I think that's what I was originally on.

4454
04:51:05,029 --> 04:51:09,000
Because, well, I went down to zero like twice.

4455
04:51:10,040 --> 04:51:12,930
Maybe that server is doing better now.

4456
04:51:12,930 --> 04:51:14,689
I don't know.

4457
04:51:14,689 --> 04:51:15,189
OK.

4458
04:51:15,189 --> 04:51:20,200
And action in three, two, one.

4459
04:51:22,959 --> 04:51:23,680
Let's go.

4460
04:51:23,680 --> 04:51:24,180
Go.

4461
04:51:24,560 --> 04:51:25,680
DDoS, go away.

4462
04:51:26,319 --> 04:51:31,599
Wait, I don't tell the story.

4463
04:51:31,599 --> 04:51:32,639
It doesn't matter for Brace and Lee.

4464
04:51:33,810 --> 04:51:34,930
You got a girlfriend?

4465
04:51:34,930 --> 04:51:42,200
I'm going to guess that's a no.

4466
04:51:43,560 --> 04:51:44,840
Dudes make too big a deal.

4467
04:51:44,840 --> 04:51:45,080
All right.

4468
04:51:45,080 --> 04:51:47,000
I have to say I will tell a story.

4469
04:51:47,000 --> 04:51:48,200
What's the big deal about girls?

4470
04:51:48,759 --> 04:51:49,240
Right here.

4471
04:51:49,959 --> 04:51:50,459
What?

4472
04:51:59,840 --> 04:52:01,840
This is, this is just.

4473
04:52:01,840 --> 04:52:02,340
Here it comes.

4474
04:52:03,479 --> 04:52:04,439
Here comes the story.

4475
04:52:05,000 --> 04:52:05,880
Hello there, sailor.

4476
04:52:06,759 --> 04:52:07,639
Excuse me?

4477
04:52:07,639 --> 04:52:08,139
Careful.

4478
04:52:08,680 --> 04:52:11,240
If you did decompress too fast, then you should go easy on me.

4479
04:52:11,240 --> 04:52:12,200
Oh, that actually happened.

4480
04:52:12,200 --> 04:52:12,919
My choice matters.

4481
04:52:12,919 --> 04:52:14,840
I think if I got the bends, I would know by now.

4482
04:52:15,799 --> 04:52:16,439
Not always.

4483
04:52:17,240 --> 04:52:19,639
Sometimes the bends can be super delayed.

4484
04:52:19,639 --> 04:52:21,799
It could be hours or a day or two.

4485
04:52:21,799 --> 04:52:22,299
The bends?

4486
04:52:23,000 --> 04:52:23,500
Yeah.

4487
04:52:23,500 --> 04:52:26,040
It's when you come up from a dive too fast.

4488
04:52:26,040 --> 04:52:27,159
Oh, oh, yeah.

4489
04:52:27,159 --> 04:52:28,599
A decompression sickness.

4490
04:52:29,159 --> 04:52:29,659
Nerd.

4491
04:52:30,279 --> 04:52:32,520
Little nitrogen bubbles that get stuck in your bloodstream.

4492
04:52:32,520 --> 04:52:33,720
Hurts like a bitch.

4493
04:52:33,720 --> 04:52:34,919
It's really serious.

4494
04:52:34,919 --> 04:52:37,319
Divers get sick and die from decompression sickness every year.

4495
04:52:37,319 --> 04:52:40,119
And that is why the good Dr. Conrad says drink them if you got them.

4496
04:52:40,119 --> 04:52:43,319
Because either you're fine or you're going to want a little something to ease the pain.

4497
04:52:43,319 --> 04:52:43,819
Julia.

4498
04:52:44,360 --> 04:52:46,520
I'm telling you not to drink any alcohol right now.

4499
04:52:46,520 --> 04:52:47,020
Oh, come on.

4500
04:52:47,639 --> 04:52:51,240
Telling you take orders from this guy just drink a beer.

4501
04:52:51,240 --> 04:52:51,740
Oh.

4502
04:52:58,869 --> 04:52:59,990
Take that as a no then.

4503
04:53:00,630 --> 04:53:01,349
That was long.

4504
04:53:02,630 --> 04:53:03,990
That became really sad.

4505
04:53:03,990 --> 04:53:05,430
Yeah, that was just like, whoa.

4506
04:53:06,310 --> 04:53:07,990
Who wants to find some sunken treasure?

4507
04:53:09,029 --> 04:53:10,279
So what do you think, Adam?

4508
04:53:10,919 --> 04:53:11,419
Coordinates?

4509
04:53:12,040 --> 04:53:13,720
Those are coordinates, all right.

4510
04:53:13,720 --> 04:53:15,400
Maybe the plane's destination?

4511
04:53:15,400 --> 04:53:16,759
You think we could get there by tomorrow?

4512
04:53:17,319 --> 04:53:19,959
It takes a couple hours if the weather stays steady.

4513
04:53:19,959 --> 04:53:20,599
Wow.

4514
04:53:20,599 --> 04:53:21,319
You find anything else?

4515
04:53:21,319 --> 04:53:22,520
I've got a story for you.

4516
04:53:23,799 --> 04:53:24,439
Reckless.

4517
04:53:24,439 --> 04:53:25,319
All of you.

4518
04:53:25,319 --> 04:53:26,119
Excuse me?

4519
04:53:26,119 --> 04:53:28,520
I told you to leave everything down there alone.

4520
04:53:28,520 --> 04:53:29,159
Oh, come on.

4521
04:53:29,159 --> 04:53:30,360
We've been through this already.

4522
04:53:30,360 --> 04:53:31,639
I'm not talking about the low.

4523
04:53:37,860 --> 04:53:39,990
Well, don't everyone talk at once?

4524
04:53:40,950 --> 04:53:48,369
What does it even matter?

4525
04:53:48,369 --> 04:53:51,810
We should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.

4526
04:53:51,810 --> 04:53:53,009
It's bad luck.

4527
04:53:53,009 --> 04:53:55,490
You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference.

4528
04:53:55,490 --> 04:53:57,970
But every single thing you bring back has an essence.

4529
04:53:57,970 --> 04:53:59,009
I can hear that.

4530
04:53:59,009 --> 04:54:00,209
It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.

4531
04:54:00,209 --> 04:54:00,770
Here we go.

4532
04:54:01,409 --> 04:54:02,689
I can hear what she's saying.

4533
04:54:02,689 --> 04:54:03,330
I've never thought about it like that.

4534
04:54:03,330 --> 04:54:04,689
You never think about much of anything.

4535
04:54:04,689 --> 04:54:07,090
Well, maybe I never heard about such cool ghost stories.

4536
04:54:07,090 --> 04:54:09,409
They're not cool ghost stories.

4537
04:54:09,409 --> 04:54:10,369
Not like for fun.

4538
04:54:11,250 --> 04:54:14,529
People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.

4539
04:54:14,529 --> 04:54:15,250
Damn straight.

4540
04:54:16,209 --> 04:54:18,369
Fred, you got a fun ghost story, right?

4541
04:54:18,369 --> 04:54:18,869
I do.

4542
04:54:20,180 --> 04:54:20,979
That is now...

4543
04:54:20,979 --> 04:54:21,299
Now that...

4544
04:54:21,299 --> 04:54:23,299
You have to say yes and then...

4545
04:54:23,299 --> 04:54:26,500
Yeah, I heard a story that happened right around here, too.

4546
04:54:26,500 --> 04:54:27,380
Let's hear it.

4547
04:54:27,380 --> 04:54:27,860
Let's hear it.

4548
04:54:27,860 --> 04:54:28,979
I'll use a good show.

4549
04:54:29,939 --> 04:54:39,669
Let's get away a little, bro.

4550
04:54:39,669 --> 04:54:40,169
Okay.

4551
04:54:40,630 --> 04:54:41,189
Here goes.

4552
04:54:41,990 --> 04:54:43,430
This story is true.

4553
04:54:43,430 --> 04:54:46,549
It had happened right near here in an old lighthouse.

4554
04:54:46,549 --> 04:54:47,509
A classic setup.

4555
04:54:47,509 --> 04:54:48,709
In an old lighthouse.

4556
04:54:48,709 --> 04:54:49,750
True story?

4557
04:54:49,750 --> 04:54:50,470
Where'd you hear this?

4558
04:54:57,240 --> 04:54:58,119
Come on now.

4559
04:54:58,119 --> 04:54:58,520
Brad.

4560
04:54:58,520 --> 04:54:59,560
Reveal your sources.

4561
04:54:59,560 --> 04:55:00,119
Brad, you all right?

4562
04:55:00,119 --> 04:55:04,599
In a lighthouse stood atop in a toll isolated from the rest of the world.

4563
04:55:04,599 --> 04:55:06,200
A lone beacon in the night.

4564
04:55:06,200 --> 04:55:07,400
A sailor's respite.

4565
04:55:08,200 --> 04:55:10,200
The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves.

4566
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:11,639
Are you telling this story?

4567
04:55:12,119 --> 04:55:12,840
It's doing it on...

4568
04:55:12,840 --> 04:55:13,720
It's doing it on...

4569
04:55:13,720 --> 04:55:15,000
I can't control it.

4570
04:55:15,000 --> 04:55:16,439
Covered in blood.

4571
04:55:16,439 --> 04:55:17,560
She's stumbling down the beach.

4572
04:55:18,119 --> 04:55:21,319
He hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms, sobbing.

4573
04:55:21,319 --> 04:55:24,680
As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.

4574
04:55:24,680 --> 04:55:26,279
He doesn't waste any time.

4575
04:55:26,279 --> 04:55:26,779
Smooth.

4576
04:55:28,119 --> 04:55:31,750
She just did a gym from the office.

4577
04:55:32,389 --> 04:55:36,069
The woman answers.

4578
04:55:36,069 --> 04:55:36,549
We got it.

4579
04:55:36,549 --> 04:55:37,430
We finally got one.

4580
04:55:37,430 --> 04:55:38,069
In the lighthouse.

4581
04:55:38,709 --> 04:55:40,310
My parents are upstairs right now.

4582
04:55:40,310 --> 04:55:41,189
Twists.

4583
04:55:41,189 --> 04:55:44,150
Of course, the lighthouse keeper says, that isn't so.

4584
04:55:44,150 --> 04:55:45,830
Of course, he's lived there alone for years.

4585
04:55:46,470 --> 04:55:50,069
The woman becomes hysterical, and his sister parents are upstairs.

4586
04:55:50,069 --> 04:55:54,470
So, they go to the top of the lighthouse, and there, splayed out on the floor,

4587
04:55:54,470 --> 04:55:57,669
is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.

4588
04:55:57,669 --> 04:55:58,790
Always an axe.

4589
04:55:58,790 --> 04:56:00,630
I mean, do people even use axes anymore?

4590
04:56:05,779 --> 04:56:07,139
Do they, Brad?

4591
04:56:07,139 --> 04:56:08,099
Okay.

4592
04:56:08,099 --> 04:56:09,540
We're sticking with axes.

4593
04:56:10,900 --> 04:56:13,060
He's pissed that you interrupted his story.

4594
04:56:13,939 --> 04:56:14,740
Just let him talk.

4595
04:56:15,619 --> 04:56:17,540
Another fourth wall break from YouTube.

4596
04:56:18,580 --> 04:56:19,540
That's so funny.

4597
04:56:20,180 --> 04:56:20,680
Who did it?

4598
04:56:28,819 --> 04:56:31,060
He doesn't want to finish the story anymore.

4599
04:56:31,700 --> 04:56:32,979
Because you interrupted him.

4600
04:56:32,979 --> 04:56:34,180
He's gotta be the woman's husband, right?

4601
04:56:34,180 --> 04:56:36,500
So, the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet.

4602
04:56:37,299 --> 04:56:38,580
Opens the door.

4603
04:56:38,580 --> 04:56:41,540
And, sure enough, there's a man inside.

4604
04:56:42,419 --> 04:56:44,580
But he's cut his own throat.

4605
04:56:45,380 --> 04:56:46,639
Horrified.

4606
04:56:46,639 --> 04:56:49,119
He looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.

4607
04:56:49,840 --> 04:56:50,400
Closer.

4608
04:56:51,360 --> 04:56:51,860
Closer.

4609
04:56:52,880 --> 04:56:56,080
And he sees it's his own face.

4610
04:56:57,119 --> 04:56:59,200
And then it's eyes bulge out and screams.

4611
04:57:02,529 --> 04:57:03,029
So gross.

4612
04:57:04,209 --> 04:57:05,009
Super twist.

4613
04:57:05,009 --> 04:57:05,509
Nice.

4614
04:57:08,310 --> 04:57:09,270
Nice one, Squire.

4615
04:57:09,990 --> 04:57:18,069
I think he told a better last time.

4616
04:57:18,069 --> 04:57:21,430
She's just fuming about being told not to drink that beer.

4617
04:57:21,430 --> 04:57:23,349
She's very aware of the camera, too.

4618
04:57:23,349 --> 04:57:23,849
I love it.

4619
04:57:24,790 --> 04:57:27,590
She keeps doing the blink right, look right into the camera.

4620
04:57:27,590 --> 04:57:28,310
No, no, no, no.

4621
04:57:28,310 --> 04:57:31,110
Because according to standard vessel regulation, we're all required

4622
04:57:31,110 --> 04:57:32,869
one more beer before hitting the hay.

4623
04:57:32,869 --> 04:57:34,229
I love that so much.

4624
04:57:34,869 --> 04:57:40,069
It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.

4625
04:57:40,069 --> 04:57:40,569
See this.

4626
04:57:41,110 --> 04:57:42,310
Where'd you read that?

4627
04:57:42,310 --> 04:57:42,790
The internet.

4628
04:57:42,790 --> 04:57:45,990
Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.

4629
04:57:45,990 --> 04:57:47,590
I'm just following orders, man.

4630
04:57:47,590 --> 04:57:48,790
I'm into this website.

4631
04:57:48,790 --> 04:57:49,909
10-4, good buddy.

4632
04:57:49,909 --> 04:57:50,630
And I'm out.

4633
04:57:51,909 --> 04:57:52,409
Okay.

4634
04:57:53,349 --> 04:57:54,709
This is where it goes to shit.

4635
04:57:55,509 --> 04:58:00,799
Here they come.

4636
04:58:02,000 --> 04:58:04,400
Here come the failable QTEs.

4637
04:58:06,520 --> 04:58:08,040
And rapid fires, et cetera.

4638
04:58:08,680 --> 04:58:15,430
I feel like I wouldn't be sleeping that well

4639
04:58:15,430 --> 04:58:18,150
on a boat in the middle of the ocean during the storm.

4640
04:58:18,150 --> 04:58:18,790
No, no way.

4641
04:58:20,549 --> 04:58:26,369
How would you sleep through that?

4642
04:58:26,369 --> 04:58:27,889
They look like they're sleeping so soundly.

4643
04:58:29,650 --> 04:58:31,490
I'm telling you, man, I don't know about you,

4644
04:58:31,490 --> 04:58:35,569
but if I hear even the handle of the door of my bedroom turn in half an inch,

4645
04:58:35,569 --> 04:58:37,569
I'm up ready for battle every time.

4646
04:58:38,290 --> 04:58:39,889
Yeah, I hear that and I get up.

4647
04:58:39,889 --> 04:58:40,389
I'm ready.

4648
04:58:41,250 --> 04:58:42,900
I mean, you can only hear it sometime.

4649
04:58:44,950 --> 04:58:45,750
No, you got to be ready.

4650
04:58:54,279 --> 04:58:57,000
Shit.

4651
04:58:58,959 --> 04:59:00,080
That's how you get woken up.

4652
04:59:00,959 --> 04:59:09,669
I didn't fight this time.

4653
04:59:11,959 --> 04:59:13,799
These people's entire motivation is money.

4654
04:59:13,799 --> 04:59:16,439
What was the conversation that you had on top of the boat?

4655
04:59:17,080 --> 04:59:20,080
I don't even remember, but don't take off anything.

4656
04:59:22,520 --> 04:59:25,560
What was the conversation these people had when they rolled up next to you?

4657
04:59:26,279 --> 04:59:29,799
Oh, they run into the buoy and then they go,

4658
04:59:29,799 --> 04:59:31,319
you bro, you damaged our boat.

4659
04:59:32,290 --> 04:59:34,770
And you can be like, oh, here's some money.

4660
04:59:34,849 --> 04:59:36,450
Conrad starts to be like, here's some money.

4661
04:59:36,450 --> 04:59:37,250
Here's 10 bucks.

4662
04:59:37,250 --> 04:59:38,610
Here's 20 bucks, loser.

4663
04:59:39,569 --> 04:59:40,450
And then they drive off.

4664
04:59:44,419 --> 04:59:46,819
They've run into like a fishing line thing, whatever it is.

4665
04:59:48,880 --> 04:59:50,479
So they're looking for money.

4666
04:59:51,459 --> 04:59:56,419
Well, no, they're just like fishermen that are just driving along

4667
04:59:56,419 --> 04:59:57,860
and they've run into our shit.

4668
04:59:58,950 --> 05:00:00,470
I'm not un-gagging anybody.

4669
05:00:08,080 --> 05:00:09,680
It's giving me an opportunity to do it again.

4670
05:00:10,400 --> 05:00:15,990
I'm not un-gagging anybody.

4671
05:00:18,919 --> 05:00:21,000
We're just going to sit here, be good,

4672
05:00:21,639 --> 05:00:23,319
and then we'll never have to go down to the ship.

4673
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:25,799
Yeah, we're like just following the orders.

4674
05:00:27,000 --> 05:00:28,119
We didn't do anything wrong.

4675
05:00:39,200 --> 05:00:40,880
Everybody's still taped.

4676
05:00:41,840 --> 05:00:44,240
We're not going to be able to communicate on the top of the boat.

4677
05:00:46,740 --> 05:00:47,380
Oh, what?

4678
05:00:48,259 --> 05:00:55,400
You could have done that the whole time.

4679
05:00:56,200 --> 05:00:57,599
Yeah, why would I take you, love?

4680
05:00:57,599 --> 05:00:59,119
We've been down here for like three hours.

4681
05:00:59,119 --> 05:01:01,040
You couldn't just get this tape off my face?

4682
05:01:01,599 --> 05:01:04,849
Wow, anybody could have done that for anybody.

4683
05:01:05,009 --> 05:01:05,810
Why's it got to be me?

4684
05:01:13,159 --> 05:01:16,200
He's like, I liked you better yesterday when you weren't even talking.

4685
05:01:19,200 --> 05:01:21,439
Hey, so good news, bad news.

4686
05:01:21,439 --> 05:01:22,400
Bad news?

4687
05:01:22,400 --> 05:01:23,680
I don't see how this could get any worse.

4688
05:01:23,680 --> 05:01:24,319
So what are we going to do here?

4689
05:01:24,319 --> 05:01:27,840
Bad news is these are kind of maybe the fishermen I missed off earlier.

4690
05:01:27,840 --> 05:01:29,439
Oh, god damn it, Conrad.

4691
05:01:29,439 --> 05:01:30,880
Great, just great.

4692
05:01:30,880 --> 05:01:31,520
And the good news?

4693
05:01:32,240 --> 05:01:33,439
I recognize them.

4694
05:01:33,439 --> 05:01:34,400
How was that good news?

4695
05:01:34,400 --> 05:01:36,159
I thought you were going to ask the good news first.

4696
05:01:36,159 --> 05:01:37,680
You're such an idiot, Jesus.

4697
05:01:49,430 --> 05:01:49,990
Choose well.

4698
05:01:53,729 --> 05:01:54,130
I am.

4699
05:01:55,729 --> 05:02:07,110
He's just, he's just stares at him.

4700
05:02:07,990 --> 05:02:09,990
Nobody knows you're out here, little lady.

4701
05:02:10,630 --> 05:02:11,990
You're all alone with us now.

4702
05:02:13,349 --> 05:02:14,709
Let's make the move, son.

4703
05:02:14,709 --> 05:02:17,270
You can go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.

4704
05:02:19,110 --> 05:02:20,389
I couldn't get out.

4705
05:02:20,389 --> 05:02:21,509
We didn't do the escape thing.

4706
05:02:23,270 --> 05:02:27,220
We're not even going to make an attempt.

4707
05:02:27,220 --> 05:02:27,459
No.

4708
05:02:28,099 --> 05:02:42,549
What's happening here?

4709
05:02:43,270 --> 05:02:45,590
I feel like I should talk here and just talk a ton of shit.

4710
05:02:46,549 --> 05:03:07,680
Try to talk about easy.

4711
05:03:08,400 --> 05:03:11,680
Fuck you.

4712
05:03:12,400 --> 05:03:13,360
I'm gonna kill you.

4713
05:03:27,349 --> 05:03:30,549
The one time I talked, I had to antagonize to make sure I got hurt.

4714
05:03:32,959 --> 05:03:35,439
Oh, yeah, I guess we do have to say something sometimes.

4715
05:03:37,720 --> 05:03:39,509
So we're not going to do anything.

4716
05:03:40,630 --> 05:03:41,669
And she's going to just break.

4717
05:03:43,119 --> 05:03:44,639
Unless it's an aggressive option.

4718
05:03:46,740 --> 05:03:48,500
Only aggressive options may be picked.

4719
05:03:49,220 --> 05:03:50,580
Yeah, aggressive only.

4720
05:03:54,610 --> 05:04:01,319
Oh, Jesus, Conrad.

4721
05:04:02,880 --> 05:04:03,439
They got me.

4722
05:04:04,799 --> 05:04:06,080
Punched him right in the eye.

4723
05:04:06,799 --> 05:04:08,369
Why didn't you tell me?

4724
05:04:08,369 --> 05:04:10,319
Well, this just happened.

4725
05:04:11,119 --> 05:04:14,639
No, but she was in here asking me what was happening and I didn't respond.

4726
05:04:16,240 --> 05:04:21,639
Deep stick.

4727
05:04:22,919 --> 05:04:23,959
Shut the fuck up.

4728
05:04:24,520 --> 05:04:28,290
I don't think they're gonna hit her.

4729
05:04:28,849 --> 05:04:30,040
They haven't hit Fliz.

4730
05:04:31,759 --> 05:04:40,099
Very chivalrous pirates.

4731
05:04:40,099 --> 05:04:43,139
Well, the climax of the story is coming up right now.

4732
05:04:46,419 --> 05:04:49,959
Hey, Tiny, or are you just taking in the scenery?

4733
05:04:53,299 --> 05:04:58,000
We have to get them to the next part.

4734
05:04:58,000 --> 05:04:58,720
There's no way.

4735
05:04:58,720 --> 05:05:00,720
He always gets lost in his own mind.

4736
05:05:00,720 --> 05:05:03,759
Once we get Julia back, maybe we can take it to my surprise.

4737
05:05:04,880 --> 05:05:08,319
Okay, so we're going to be violent here?

4738
05:05:08,319 --> 05:05:09,360
We're going to be violent here, I guess.

4739
05:05:17,119 --> 05:05:25,919
Yeah, just absolutely reckless.

4740
05:05:35,270 --> 05:05:36,150
I got the scissors.

4741
05:05:37,110 --> 05:05:39,509
I'm gonna stab that guy when he comes in from the door.

4742
05:05:40,389 --> 05:05:43,509
We just have to wait and see what they want to do with us.

4743
05:06:00,849 --> 05:06:02,290
So what's the plan here?

4744
05:06:03,409 --> 05:06:04,209
We already failed this.

4745
05:06:04,209 --> 05:06:05,330
Yeah, we failed this already.

4746
05:06:06,930 --> 05:06:08,689
We may as well, like, actually do this one.

4747
05:06:09,490 --> 05:06:10,450
Yeah, it's a speedboat.

4748
05:06:12,549 --> 05:06:13,509
He's got a gun.

4749
05:06:13,509 --> 05:06:16,919
I have to be reckless.

4750
05:06:16,919 --> 05:06:19,319
If you can clear the cards right, we can catch him by surprise.

4751
05:06:19,319 --> 05:06:19,799
Take him out.

4752
05:06:26,130 --> 05:06:27,490
I think I've seen some shit.

4753
05:06:27,490 --> 05:06:28,049
What do you think?

4754
05:06:29,090 --> 05:06:29,810
Seven seconds.

4755
05:06:30,529 --> 05:06:31,729
I can get out through the window.

4756
05:06:31,729 --> 05:06:32,849
We got to break these off first.

4757
05:06:32,849 --> 05:06:35,409
I hope I can fall off the fucking side of them.

4758
05:06:36,930 --> 05:06:37,409
Good call.

4759
05:06:40,770 --> 05:06:42,529
Here, I'll climb out this window.

4760
05:06:42,529 --> 05:06:43,409
Take a look around.

4761
05:06:43,409 --> 05:06:44,209
Just scope it out.

4762
05:06:44,209 --> 05:06:46,529
You guys distract them so they don't see me sneaking.

4763
05:06:50,959 --> 05:06:53,520
But if we fail, then they come in and we can fight them.

4764
05:06:53,520 --> 05:06:54,880
So which one's better?

4765
05:06:54,880 --> 05:06:56,959
Yeah, definitely fail so we can be aggressive.

4766
05:06:56,959 --> 05:07:12,180
Three, two, I'm sorry.

4767
05:07:12,180 --> 05:07:13,299
I got really, I panicked.

4768
05:07:14,180 --> 05:07:15,639
I got really into it.

4769
05:07:16,599 --> 05:07:17,319
Oh, my God.

4770
05:07:18,040 --> 05:07:20,099
I tried to use left thumb stick.

4771
05:07:30,979 --> 05:07:32,259
Wait, how did we get into this?

4772
05:07:32,259 --> 05:07:33,060
Stupid.

4773
05:07:33,060 --> 05:07:34,549
It's the same situation.

4774
05:07:34,549 --> 05:07:35,430
It's the same situation.

4775
05:07:37,270 --> 05:07:39,270
No, no, no, no, you're the hostage now.

4776
05:07:41,560 --> 05:07:42,060
What?

4777
05:07:42,060 --> 05:07:45,909
Brad's down.

4778
05:07:49,860 --> 05:07:52,340
Did Brad get down by running into that guy?

4779
05:07:52,340 --> 05:07:55,220
I don't, why don't we get to see what's going on in the boat?

4780
05:07:57,939 --> 05:07:58,979
Wait, where are you?

4781
05:07:58,979 --> 05:07:59,700
I'm on the ground.

4782
05:08:01,209 --> 05:08:03,349
Oh, I see.

4783
05:08:08,310 --> 05:08:09,189
Go for it.

4784
05:08:09,189 --> 05:08:16,380
Oh, shit.

4785
05:08:23,180 --> 05:08:24,700
Shooting down in a boat.

4786
05:08:25,419 --> 05:08:26,159
Smart.

4787
05:08:31,029 --> 05:08:31,990
Dude, nothing.

4788
05:08:33,349 --> 05:08:34,549
The flag's there.

4789
05:08:35,189 --> 05:08:37,270
Can you stab him?

4790
05:09:00,779 --> 05:09:01,659
Get off our boat.

4791
05:09:19,779 --> 05:09:21,060
Is it the same timeline?

4792
05:09:37,430 --> 05:09:40,549
The way to get Conrad killed is you have to, I have to try to escape.

4793
05:09:51,880 --> 05:10:02,459
Yeah, maybe we can sell some of these plates or cups.

4794
05:10:04,380 --> 05:10:05,819
I found the gold.

4795
05:10:15,720 --> 05:10:18,200
Which one of you is going to tell me about this?

4796
05:10:19,639 --> 05:10:21,000
Manchurian goo.

4797
05:10:28,659 --> 05:10:29,459
I don't think so.

4798
05:10:31,299 --> 05:10:42,630
All right, make a break, boy.

4799
05:10:44,630 --> 05:10:46,950
Anything to like it, to try to get yourself hurt.

4800
05:10:46,950 --> 05:10:47,909
We're gonna be fine, JJ.

4801
05:10:48,869 --> 05:11:06,650
Ah, could we have been so stupid?

4802
05:11:07,529 --> 05:11:08,729
We're lucky it's not worth.

4803
05:11:10,330 --> 05:11:11,130
Could have been killed.

4804
05:11:11,930 --> 05:11:14,220
What were you thinking?

4805
05:11:15,779 --> 05:11:17,380
I, never mind.

4806
05:11:18,180 --> 05:11:23,209
That's it?

4807
05:11:23,209 --> 05:11:24,330
That's all you fucking thought?

4808
05:11:24,330 --> 05:11:26,970
All right, shut the fuck up.

4809
05:11:28,250 --> 05:11:32,060
What do you got?

4810
05:11:33,529 --> 05:11:34,729
You know what I like from you?

4811
05:11:35,689 --> 05:11:36,189
Nothing.

4812
05:11:37,529 --> 05:11:38,029
That's right.

4813
05:11:38,729 --> 05:11:39,229
Nada.

4814
05:11:39,930 --> 05:11:41,689
Complete fucking silence.

4815
05:11:42,869 --> 05:11:43,349
Get it?

4816
05:11:43,349 --> 05:11:44,470
By the way, I love this stream.

4817
05:11:47,110 --> 05:11:47,909
Don't say anything.

4818
05:11:49,369 --> 05:11:50,090
You ruined it.

4819
05:11:50,090 --> 05:11:50,889
You're gonna ruin it.

4820
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:55,139
I didn't say anything.

4821
05:11:56,099 --> 05:11:56,819
I'm being chat.

4822
05:11:56,819 --> 05:11:57,319
He's chat.

4823
05:11:59,450 --> 05:12:00,650
Oh, I see you're being chat.

4824
05:12:07,189 --> 05:12:11,189
You know what I don't, okay, if you have a game that has like,

4825
05:12:11,189 --> 05:12:13,909
be careful you can die and QTEs are in the game,

4826
05:12:13,909 --> 05:12:15,590
but the QTEs don't do anything.

4827
05:12:16,150 --> 05:12:18,150
What's the point of having them in the first place?

4828
05:12:18,150 --> 05:12:19,029
They don't do anything.

4829
05:12:19,990 --> 05:12:24,150
They just do, but only like, up to four times.

4830
05:12:27,060 --> 05:12:28,180
So are they like three?

4831
05:12:29,220 --> 05:12:31,060
FYI, it's gonna be a long countdown.

4832
05:12:32,979 --> 05:12:36,819
Like I have a choice to make and it's ticking down as slow as possible.

4833
05:12:36,819 --> 05:12:37,319
Oh.

4834
05:12:38,419 --> 05:12:43,240
So we're gonna be here for at least another like,

4835
05:12:43,240 --> 05:12:44,520
maybe hundred and twenty seconds.

4836
05:12:44,520 --> 05:12:45,560
Requesting weather update.

4837
05:12:45,560 --> 05:12:46,060
That's all right.

4838
05:12:47,159 --> 05:12:47,659
Over.

4839
05:12:48,599 --> 05:12:50,229
But I know what you're saying, like,

4840
05:12:51,189 --> 05:12:53,750
that's why I actually liked Detroit Become Human,

4841
05:12:53,750 --> 05:12:56,630
because at least, whatever you thought about the story,

4842
05:12:57,270 --> 05:13:00,709
you actually, like, I lost half the cast in the game.

4843
05:13:02,069 --> 05:13:02,869
Trying not to.

4844
05:13:04,470 --> 05:13:07,939
We did so bad the first run,

4845
05:13:07,939 --> 05:13:10,819
and everyone was fine up until the very final cutscene.

4846
05:13:12,099 --> 05:13:13,619
I mean, it's actually the supreme help.

4847
05:13:19,130 --> 05:13:20,169
He wasn't gonna kill me.

4848
05:13:21,560 --> 05:13:23,560
Everything's better when we have each other.

4849
05:13:23,560 --> 05:13:26,599
There's the classic frying pan moment from earlier.

4850
05:13:30,200 --> 05:13:31,400
Pan joke again.

4851
05:13:32,599 --> 05:14:00,009
I'm gonna, I'm gonna help this time,

4852
05:14:00,009 --> 05:14:01,209
because I held on last time.

4853
05:14:04,790 --> 05:14:05,990
What the fuck was that?

4854
05:14:05,990 --> 05:14:06,630
Where are you?

4855
05:14:06,630 --> 05:14:08,729
You have to call out.

4856
05:14:08,729 --> 05:14:10,759
Hey, move it.

4857
05:14:12,580 --> 05:14:13,080
Now.

4858
05:14:13,860 --> 05:14:16,250
Yeah, I don't think I did enough.

4859
05:14:16,250 --> 05:14:17,369
I didn't help either person.

4860
05:14:17,369 --> 05:14:19,290
It was a telltale like, who are you gonna help?

4861
05:14:19,290 --> 05:14:22,889
I think, I figured if I ran, I figured if I ran to help.

4862
05:14:24,169 --> 05:14:29,340
I, I, my mind clouded over, I, I blinked.

4863
05:14:29,340 --> 05:14:30,630
At least you tried.

4864
05:14:32,790 --> 05:14:35,189
I thought if I ran, that the bump was gonna hit a bump,

4865
05:14:35,189 --> 05:14:36,310
and it was gonna fuck me up.

4866
05:14:37,189 --> 05:14:48,490
How did we find this while the ship is sinking?

4867
05:15:13,770 --> 05:15:15,610
At this point, we're basically like,

4868
05:15:15,610 --> 05:15:18,090
the hit new summer blockbuster movie,

4869
05:15:18,090 --> 05:15:20,250
but this is the second evening showing

4870
05:15:20,250 --> 05:15:23,610
where the projector boy fell asleep in the upstairs loft.

4871
05:15:23,610 --> 05:15:25,049
Things could have been quite different.

4872
05:15:25,049 --> 05:15:27,450
We didn't speak, and we did everything wrong.

4873
05:15:28,409 --> 05:15:39,459
Kind-hearted creature I am,

4874
05:15:39,459 --> 05:15:41,860
I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's down.

4875
05:15:41,860 --> 05:15:43,299
Let's hear what he's gotta say.

4876
05:15:43,299 --> 05:15:44,500
Yeah, we could, let's get some tips.

4877
05:15:45,700 --> 05:15:47,029
It's a good idea.

4878
05:15:49,189 --> 05:15:49,830
Uh, yeah.

4879
05:15:51,590 --> 05:15:53,990
Okay, you're in agreement.

4880
05:15:54,790 --> 05:15:56,310
Clue, it is.

4881
05:15:57,110 --> 05:16:01,349
The merchant of Venice, act two, scene seven.

4882
05:16:01,349 --> 05:16:05,669
The prince of Morocco pulls a scroll from the eye of a skull

4883
05:16:05,830 --> 05:16:09,990
and reads, all that glisters is not gold.

4884
05:16:10,630 --> 05:16:12,869
Often have you heard that told?

4885
05:16:16,500 --> 05:16:19,459
Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significance,

4886
05:16:21,700 --> 05:16:24,580
I presume you're eager to get back to your story.

4887
05:16:24,580 --> 05:16:25,619
But here's a thing.

4888
05:16:26,979 --> 05:16:30,500
Everything may not be entirely as it seems.

4889
05:16:31,299 --> 05:16:32,659
Here's another weird-

4890
05:16:32,659 --> 05:16:34,180
That's when I figured out the whole game.

4891
05:16:35,060 --> 05:16:38,340
But, but what's, what, why is this guy in the fucking game?

4892
05:16:38,340 --> 05:16:39,939
Nobody shouldn't have said that.

4893
05:16:39,939 --> 05:16:40,659
Yeah, you know what I mean?

4894
05:16:40,659 --> 05:16:41,060
Like what-

4895
05:16:41,060 --> 05:16:46,020
He's supposed to be like the guy through all the anthology games.

4896
05:16:46,020 --> 05:16:49,700
And maybe they've got an idea where so many games down the road,

4897
05:16:50,340 --> 05:16:54,099
you actually either play as him or play with him as an antagonist.

4898
05:16:55,700 --> 05:17:00,659
So he's like, hey, you're getting to know like the eventual episode seven villain.

4899
05:17:01,540 --> 05:17:07,380
Cause everybody loved Peter Storm Aaron until dawn,

4900
05:17:07,380 --> 05:17:09,860
but Peter Storm Aaron until dawn, no spoilers.

4901
05:17:10,740 --> 05:17:11,459
He was it.

4902
05:17:11,459 --> 05:17:13,779
He was like, he was, he was a character.

4903
05:17:13,779 --> 05:17:14,580
He was an actor in that.

4904
05:17:15,939 --> 05:17:16,340
Nevermind.

4905
05:17:17,700 --> 05:17:18,259
He was an actor.

4906
05:17:41,860 --> 05:17:43,540
We can't skip any cut scene.

4907
05:17:47,139 --> 05:17:47,700
We've tried.

4908
05:17:53,909 --> 05:17:55,080
Oh, wow.

4909
05:17:55,080 --> 05:17:55,639
That's different.

4910
05:17:56,279 --> 05:17:57,159
Are you failing these?

4911
05:17:57,720 --> 05:17:58,759
There is nothing for me to do.

4912
05:18:05,020 --> 05:18:06,939
You skip the cut scene, you skip the game.

4913
05:18:06,939 --> 05:18:07,500
That's true.

4914
05:18:09,020 --> 05:18:17,099
Oh no, we have to walk.

4915
05:18:17,900 --> 05:18:20,459
I was going to say, yeah, this segment right here is pretty,

4916
05:18:21,819 --> 05:18:24,299
pretty lengthy until we get put in the room.

4917
05:18:26,299 --> 05:18:26,939
Nope.

4918
05:18:26,939 --> 05:18:27,500
No thanks.

4919
05:18:29,639 --> 05:18:29,880
Shit.

4920
05:18:32,310 --> 05:18:36,069
I think maybe if we just walk in a straight line and don't stop to look at anything,

4921
05:18:36,069 --> 05:18:37,029
it might just advance.

4922
05:18:38,229 --> 05:18:40,950
Somebody just teleported across the screen on the left for me.

4923
05:18:41,909 --> 05:18:49,290
No, don't interact with anything.

4924
05:18:49,290 --> 05:18:50,169
Just walk in a straight line.

4925
05:18:54,619 --> 05:18:57,580
Didn't, didn't this do get like shot in the leg?

4926
05:18:59,020 --> 05:19:00,939
Wouldn't you be more than limping right now?

4927
05:19:01,900 --> 05:19:02,779
Probably.

4928
05:19:02,779 --> 05:19:04,060
Like not able to walk.

4929
05:19:05,020 --> 05:19:07,000
Hold on.

4930
05:19:07,000 --> 05:19:08,119
There is something you can do.

4931
05:19:08,840 --> 05:19:11,509
Which, which character are you?

4932
05:19:12,549 --> 05:19:13,110
I'm Julie.

4933
05:19:13,830 --> 05:19:15,189
Oh, try this.

4934
05:19:20,279 --> 05:19:20,520
Okay.

4935
05:19:20,520 --> 05:19:20,840
We're good.

4936
05:19:20,840 --> 05:19:21,319
We're in the room.

4937
05:19:26,220 --> 05:19:26,939
Oh no.

4938
05:19:26,939 --> 05:19:28,060
What, what even is that?

4939
05:19:29,099 --> 05:19:29,259
Yeah.

4940
05:19:29,259 --> 05:19:31,419
What did the, what, what is, I don't know.

4941
05:19:31,419 --> 05:19:42,540
That's a handcuff or we're skipping jump scares.

4942
05:19:45,319 --> 05:19:46,439
He's the guy in the haunted house.

4943
05:19:46,439 --> 05:19:48,200
When you go with a group of friends that doesn't just

4944
05:19:48,200 --> 05:19:50,599
want to get through it as fast as possible.

4945
05:19:50,599 --> 05:19:51,080
Go, go, go.

4946
05:19:51,080 --> 05:19:51,639
I don't want to see this.

4947
05:19:51,639 --> 05:19:54,840
Like the clown, the scary clown could dismiss the queue because

4948
05:19:54,840 --> 05:19:56,200
your friend wants to go so damn fast.

4949
05:19:56,919 --> 05:20:09,639
What are they going to do with us?

4950
05:20:16,009 --> 05:20:16,409
Oh shit.

4951
05:20:22,119 --> 05:20:23,959
This is just the haunted house with the friends.

4952
05:20:23,959 --> 05:20:24,680
That's what this is.

4953
05:20:28,279 --> 05:20:29,799
I was just becoming the monster.

4954
05:20:31,639 --> 05:20:31,959
Okay.

4955
05:20:32,680 --> 05:20:33,159
All of you.

4956
05:20:35,779 --> 05:20:37,220
We made it actually was not that long.

4957
05:20:37,220 --> 05:20:38,900
That was a full 10 straight minutes.

4958
05:20:38,900 --> 05:20:39,459
Funny story.

4959
05:20:39,459 --> 05:20:41,860
I just kind of sat there while you walk knowing that you would

4960
05:20:41,860 --> 05:20:45,860
you like me over to the new and I kept turning around trying

4961
05:20:45,860 --> 05:20:48,180
to like piss off the guard enough to make me do something.

4962
05:20:49,380 --> 05:20:51,459
Pirates are actors and they can't hurt you.

4963
05:20:51,779 --> 05:20:53,860
Hey, it's pitch black in here.

4964
05:20:54,659 --> 05:20:54,900
Give us.

4965
05:20:59,779 --> 05:21:01,380
That's my joke.

4966
05:21:01,380 --> 05:21:02,259
I used that yesterday.

4967
05:21:02,259 --> 05:21:02,580
Sorry.

4968
05:21:02,580 --> 05:21:02,900
Did you?

4969
05:21:03,779 --> 05:21:04,500
That's funny.

4970
05:21:04,500 --> 05:21:05,860
I got a copyright claim.

4971
05:21:05,860 --> 05:21:06,419
That one.

4972
05:21:06,419 --> 05:21:06,740
That's it.

4973
05:21:09,959 --> 05:21:20,360
All right.

4974
05:21:20,360 --> 05:21:21,400
Now how do we go from here?

4975
05:21:25,799 --> 05:21:28,520
Um, I think we just move the table.

4976
05:21:28,520 --> 05:21:29,560
Yeah, we just didn't move table.

4977
05:21:29,560 --> 05:21:30,040
Leave it open.

4978
05:21:30,599 --> 05:21:37,340
Wherever we are.

4979
05:21:37,340 --> 05:21:38,139
It's not good.

4980
05:21:38,939 --> 05:21:48,229
I can't believe it's taken this long for us to have something like

4981
05:21:48,229 --> 05:21:49,430
We can't just sit around.

4982
05:21:50,069 --> 05:21:50,869
We need a plan.

4983
05:21:51,849 --> 05:21:55,930
Yeah, we're not exactly in the best position to be making any

4984
05:21:55,930 --> 05:21:56,250
All right.

4985
05:21:56,250 --> 05:21:59,130
Good stuff should be coming up because they're going to hear us and break in.

4986
05:21:59,130 --> 05:22:00,009
We just don't run.

4987
05:22:00,009 --> 05:22:02,009
Got to take advantage of it and get off the ship.

4988
05:22:03,369 --> 05:22:07,720
Just don't do anything.

4989
05:22:07,720 --> 05:22:13,340
And I don't think all of us are currently strong enough to mount an escape.

4990
05:22:14,060 --> 05:22:16,779
We cared so much about the beginning too.

4991
05:22:16,779 --> 05:22:18,700
We tried to like do like the double hostage.

4992
05:22:18,700 --> 05:22:19,740
I'll go for the gun.

4993
05:22:19,740 --> 05:22:21,659
They don't matter.

4994
05:22:21,659 --> 05:22:23,340
It's going to be difficult to get anywhere without it.

4995
05:22:23,900 --> 05:22:31,430
I got shocked.

4996
05:22:31,430 --> 05:22:32,470
Maybe we can.

4997
05:22:32,470 --> 05:22:34,470
Yeah, kill all hallucinations by the way.

4998
05:22:35,110 --> 05:22:36,950
No, you can't hotwire it.

4999
05:22:36,950 --> 05:22:38,069
We need the distributor.

5000
05:22:38,069 --> 05:22:40,310
That's the only it's probably the only way to kill them.

5001
05:22:41,430 --> 05:22:45,189
I think they just really want you to be the reason why the main cast dies.

5002
05:22:45,189 --> 05:22:51,319
Got to take advantage and look around for a way out of here.

5003
05:22:51,319 --> 05:22:51,639
All right.

5004
05:22:51,639 --> 05:22:54,599
So let's go to the thing in the wall right here.

5005
05:22:55,319 --> 05:22:57,990
It's like in the corner, right?

5006
05:23:04,200 --> 05:23:10,389
Get that fucking thing open.

5007
05:23:12,380 --> 05:23:14,840
Hey, what I found over here.

5008
05:23:15,240 --> 05:23:30,759
What's going on?

5009
05:23:31,930 --> 05:23:41,240
Uh, he has to try and fail while we continue to look around the room.

5010
05:23:41,240 --> 05:23:41,720
I don't know.

5011
05:23:42,520 --> 05:23:49,799
We might have to trigger something here.

5012
05:23:50,360 --> 05:23:53,450
We might.

5013
05:23:53,450 --> 05:23:55,049
Yeah, I think we have to like touch something.

5014
05:23:56,169 --> 05:23:59,259
How about if we do that doing that forever?

5015
05:24:02,099 --> 05:24:03,159
Oh, here we go.

5016
05:24:08,419 --> 05:24:10,360
There's Alex.

5017
05:24:10,360 --> 05:24:10,840
Come take a look.

5018
05:24:11,720 --> 05:24:16,729
How's it looking?

5019
05:24:16,729 --> 05:24:17,770
I can't get it open.

5020
05:24:17,770 --> 05:24:18,569
There we go.

5021
05:24:18,569 --> 05:24:20,970
Well, whatever I was doing was not important.

5022
05:24:28,279 --> 05:24:31,290
So this time we're going to don't make any noise.

5023
05:24:33,290 --> 05:24:36,090
I think we just don't make a decision to barricade.

5024
05:24:36,090 --> 05:24:39,529
I had to make a decision to barricade or run or like hide.

5025
05:24:39,529 --> 05:24:40,490
So just stand around.

5026
05:24:41,209 --> 05:24:42,490
So we're just going to make a noise.

5027
05:24:43,849 --> 05:24:45,209
I have to make that choice.

5028
05:24:47,610 --> 05:24:52,299
See if they can get caught, I guess.

5029
05:24:57,209 --> 05:24:58,970
Oh, you're going full silence no matter what.

5030
05:24:59,369 --> 05:25:00,569
Oh, I mean, my decision was...

5031
05:25:02,169 --> 05:25:03,369
Okay, barricade the door.

5032
05:25:03,369 --> 05:25:04,490
Conrad, you do it.

5033
05:25:04,490 --> 05:25:04,810
Nothing.

5034
05:25:12,090 --> 05:25:14,009
So yeah, you go over and you go like,

5035
05:25:14,009 --> 05:25:14,889
Hey, you fucker.

5036
05:25:14,889 --> 05:25:16,090
Hey, you stupid fucker.

5037
05:25:16,090 --> 05:25:16,490
You dumb fucker.

5038
05:25:41,990 --> 05:25:43,189
One-legged fuck faces.

5039
05:25:43,189 --> 05:25:44,869
Yeah, you smarmy barmans.

5040
05:25:44,869 --> 05:25:45,590
Yeah, no, you.

5041
05:25:45,590 --> 05:25:48,150
I'm going to rip your pirate parents off your shoulders

5042
05:25:48,150 --> 05:25:50,549
and stomp them into rainbow-colored stew.

5043
05:25:50,549 --> 05:25:52,659
I'm warning you.

5044
05:25:53,220 --> 05:25:54,740
I am an American citizen.

5045
05:25:54,740 --> 05:25:56,900
You really want me as president coming after you guys?

5046
05:25:56,900 --> 05:25:58,020
Because he will.

5047
05:25:58,020 --> 05:25:59,540
Each and every one of you personally.

5048
05:26:00,419 --> 05:26:01,689
Very personally.

5049
05:26:01,689 --> 05:26:02,729
Can we just not run?

5050
05:26:05,369 --> 05:26:07,689
Hey, can you hear me?

5051
05:26:08,409 --> 05:26:09,209
I'm talking to you.

5052
05:26:10,439 --> 05:26:10,939
I...

5053
05:26:12,279 --> 05:26:13,959
We go through, then I can...

5054
05:26:16,279 --> 05:26:17,639
Do not pull the cover back.

5055
05:26:18,360 --> 05:26:19,240
His leaf is open.

5056
05:26:21,880 --> 05:26:31,880
I'll do nothing, I guess.

5057
05:26:36,360 --> 05:26:36,860
What?

5058
05:26:43,080 --> 05:26:43,580
Oh, no.

5059
05:26:44,279 --> 05:26:44,840
He got me.

5060
05:26:47,799 --> 05:26:50,680
I got the one non-playable character for this next segment.

5061
05:26:52,259 --> 05:26:53,060
Great success.

5062
05:27:01,209 --> 05:27:01,930
Isn't she not?

5063
05:27:01,930 --> 05:27:02,409
No, she's not.

5064
05:27:02,409 --> 05:27:03,849
Yeah, she's not in either crew.

5065
05:27:05,369 --> 05:27:07,130
You don't play as her for a long time.

5066
05:27:07,770 --> 05:27:08,729
Not to the end of the game, I don't think.

5067
05:27:09,529 --> 05:27:11,049
I'm the reason she got snagged.

5068
05:27:11,049 --> 05:27:11,610
Yep.

5069
05:27:11,610 --> 05:27:12,569
Gotta get her.

5070
05:27:12,569 --> 05:27:13,069
No way.

5071
05:27:13,689 --> 05:27:14,810
No heroics.

5072
05:27:14,810 --> 05:27:16,569
We gotta get as far away from here as we can.

5073
05:27:19,029 --> 05:27:22,200
What?

5074
05:27:22,200 --> 05:27:23,560
You can't decide to go back?

5075
05:27:23,560 --> 05:27:24,060
No.

5076
05:27:24,759 --> 05:27:26,439
So hard to kill all these people.

5077
05:27:26,439 --> 05:27:30,119
That's the premise of Cabin in the Woods.

5078
05:27:30,119 --> 05:27:30,919
Look, through the haunted house.

5079
05:27:53,750 --> 05:27:54,869
That room was blinking.

5080
05:27:54,869 --> 05:27:55,750
Please come in here.

5081
05:27:56,549 --> 05:27:57,049
No.

5082
05:27:57,669 --> 05:27:58,860
I think I'm all right.

5083
05:28:01,189 --> 05:28:02,470
Just keep going.

5084
05:28:03,029 --> 05:28:05,029
Why am I...

5085
05:28:05,029 --> 05:28:06,869
How do you walk faster in this game?

5086
05:28:06,869 --> 05:28:07,909
Left bumper?

5087
05:28:07,909 --> 05:28:08,470
Hold it.

5088
05:28:08,470 --> 05:28:09,110
That's why I thought.

5089
05:28:09,110 --> 05:28:09,590
But I don't...

5090
05:28:09,590 --> 05:28:10,709
It doesn't actually go faster.

5091
05:28:11,430 --> 05:28:12,709
I think it's a placebo effect.

5092
05:28:14,709 --> 05:28:16,599
But you're always faster than me.

5093
05:28:17,580 --> 05:28:18,080
Am I?

5094
05:28:18,779 --> 05:28:19,979
Yeah, you're way ahead of me.

5095
05:28:20,619 --> 05:28:21,419
Well, I'm just...

5096
05:28:21,419 --> 05:28:24,139
I am also walking as the guy who got shot in the leg.

5097
05:28:26,380 --> 05:28:28,060
But I was still this slow the rest of the game.

5098
05:28:28,060 --> 05:28:31,099
Maybe everyone's hiding in the hole for a big surprise party.

5099
05:28:31,099 --> 05:28:31,900
Because of the bullet.

5100
05:28:32,939 --> 05:28:37,590
This isn't happening to me previously though.

5101
05:28:37,590 --> 05:28:39,189
He didn't get shot in the leg last time.

5102
05:28:40,150 --> 05:28:41,270
I just bumped the camera.

5103
05:28:42,389 --> 05:28:43,110
Oh, sorry.

5104
05:28:43,110 --> 05:28:43,750
Sorry, Jerry.

5105
05:28:44,389 --> 05:28:46,259
I'm supposed to go this way?

5106
05:28:46,259 --> 05:28:46,580
This way?

5107
05:28:46,580 --> 05:28:46,819
That way?

5108
05:28:46,819 --> 05:28:47,060
Okay.

5109
05:28:47,060 --> 05:28:47,459
I'm sorry.

5110
05:28:49,880 --> 05:28:50,439
All right.

5111
05:28:50,439 --> 05:28:51,720
That did not happen before.

5112
05:28:52,439 --> 05:28:53,799
I didn't even see that.

5113
05:28:53,799 --> 05:28:55,159
I was probably reading some lore.

5114
05:28:56,439 --> 05:28:58,279
Kind of important to see that.

5115
05:28:59,400 --> 05:29:00,680
I got yoinked last time.

5116
05:29:03,459 --> 05:29:04,740
Like this, actually.

5117
05:29:05,220 --> 05:29:05,720
Hi.

5118
05:29:06,259 --> 05:29:08,939
Wasn't I shot in the head?

5119
05:29:08,939 --> 05:29:09,439
Yes.

5120
05:29:10,220 --> 05:29:10,720
Sort of.

5121
05:29:11,279 --> 05:29:14,360
There's someone down there.

5122
05:29:14,360 --> 05:29:17,759
So you already got both these people caught.

5123
05:29:17,759 --> 05:29:18,400
Nothing happens.

5124
05:29:18,400 --> 05:29:20,000
What happens if you just don't go down?

5125
05:29:20,000 --> 05:29:21,200
What happens if I just don't do it?

5126
05:29:21,200 --> 05:29:22,080
I'm just not gonna do anything.

5127
05:29:22,080 --> 05:29:23,680
I'm not gonna throw any stuff down there.

5128
05:29:52,830 --> 05:29:54,189
We should grab it.

5129
05:30:04,380 --> 05:30:05,900
Sorry, I almost did something there.

5130
05:30:06,919 --> 05:30:07,639
Accidentally.

5131
05:30:07,639 --> 05:30:08,139
Okay.

5132
05:30:09,000 --> 05:30:11,020
I actively had to try to do nothing there.

5133
05:30:11,020 --> 05:30:11,900
I almost fucked it up.

5134
05:30:22,840 --> 05:30:24,759
I think the biggest problem is the whole...

5135
05:30:24,759 --> 05:30:25,319
Holy crap.

5136
05:30:25,319 --> 05:30:28,520
You actually control a party of five characters gimmick because

5137
05:30:29,560 --> 05:30:32,520
you only get to control one character for a very brief amount of time,

5138
05:30:32,520 --> 05:30:34,279
and then if you choose not to,

5139
05:30:34,279 --> 05:30:35,240
that dude's just like,

5140
05:30:35,240 --> 05:30:35,799
I don't care.

5141
05:30:35,799 --> 05:30:36,680
I'm going anyway.

5142
05:30:38,200 --> 05:30:39,799
And you didn't tell him to do that.

5143
05:30:40,439 --> 05:30:41,880
I didn't tell him to do anything, actually.

5144
05:30:42,439 --> 05:30:43,080
That's what I mean.

5145
05:30:43,720 --> 05:30:44,520
I just sat there.

5146
05:30:44,520 --> 05:30:45,799
You don't actually have any control.

5147
05:30:46,520 --> 05:30:59,279
Somebody mentioned that until dawn

5148
05:31:00,080 --> 05:31:02,720
has a period where like the first few hours or so,

5149
05:31:02,720 --> 05:31:03,759
the first couple hours,

5150
05:31:03,759 --> 05:31:05,680
nobody, you can't like anybody killed.

5151
05:31:05,680 --> 05:31:08,720
The only difference though is this game is only like three hours long

5152
05:31:09,360 --> 05:31:12,720
until dawn is like at least like what?

5153
05:31:12,720 --> 05:31:14,799
Like six, seven, eight hours at least.

5154
05:31:22,779 --> 05:31:23,740
So that can happen.

5155
05:31:28,959 --> 05:31:32,090
Wait, what?

5156
05:31:32,090 --> 05:31:33,770
When did that happen?

5157
05:31:45,200 --> 05:31:49,319
So I have an option to throw something here.

5158
05:31:50,459 --> 05:31:51,340
What if I just don't?

5159
05:31:53,560 --> 05:31:54,680
If you just throw nothing?

5160
05:31:55,720 --> 05:31:59,979
I mean, I can throw it at him.

5161
05:31:59,979 --> 05:32:02,060
No, we don't.

5162
05:32:02,060 --> 05:32:05,099
We haven't got to play in like a full, like three minutes.

5163
05:32:08,270 --> 05:32:09,950
Yeah, we've just kind of just been watching the.

5164
05:32:11,069 --> 05:32:15,639
I think that's, I think it's like length.

5165
05:32:15,639 --> 05:32:16,360
I think that's the problem.

5166
05:32:17,520 --> 05:32:19,840
Because when you got to that point,

5167
05:32:19,840 --> 05:32:21,439
like two hours into until dawn,

5168
05:32:21,439 --> 05:32:23,119
when it really, really started to get going,

5169
05:32:23,119 --> 05:32:25,439
you had a whole game there that was still going.

5170
05:32:25,439 --> 05:32:27,360
This is like two or three hours in.

5171
05:32:28,159 --> 05:32:28,479
All right.

5172
05:32:28,479 --> 05:32:29,759
And who died at the end of the game?

5173
05:32:29,759 --> 05:32:31,279
Who fucking killed that guy?

5174
05:32:31,279 --> 05:32:33,200
You stabbed yourself in the stomach by credits.

5175
05:32:34,360 --> 05:32:35,479
It just kind of jumps up on you.

5176
05:32:35,479 --> 05:32:36,279
Where are you taking us?

5177
05:32:36,279 --> 05:32:36,919
Very, very quickly.

5178
05:32:36,919 --> 05:32:37,479
I don't know what they're telling you.

5179
05:32:37,479 --> 05:32:38,119
Yeah, get out of here.

5180
05:32:38,119 --> 05:32:39,000
They're like closing it down.

5181
05:32:39,799 --> 05:32:40,830
I can't move.

5182
05:32:41,790 --> 05:32:44,000
Can you move?

5183
05:32:46,619 --> 05:32:47,790
I can.

5184
05:32:47,790 --> 05:32:48,029
No.

5185
05:32:48,590 --> 05:32:49,389
Yeah, can I?

5186
05:32:49,389 --> 05:32:49,790
Who am?

5187
05:32:50,909 --> 05:32:52,029
Okay, I'm flissed.

5188
05:32:55,560 --> 05:32:57,159
I'm not even touching the controller

5189
05:32:57,159 --> 05:32:59,400
and Alex is phasing into the wall at the moment.

5190
05:33:00,040 --> 05:33:02,599
And it's also a close-up of somebody's ass.

5191
05:33:05,979 --> 05:33:07,180
And ass is gone.

5192
05:33:08,520 --> 05:33:09,400
All right, let's go.

5193
05:33:13,049 --> 05:33:13,689
I can't.

5194
05:33:13,689 --> 05:33:14,970
I can't do anything.

5195
05:33:19,479 --> 05:33:19,959
You ready?

5196
05:33:19,959 --> 05:33:21,159
I'm ready to take him out.

5197
05:33:22,520 --> 05:33:26,599
I'm stuck in the wall.

5198
05:33:33,240 --> 05:33:35,389
Stop.

5199
05:33:35,389 --> 05:33:38,590
Because wait, but like we're going so quickly right now.

5200
05:33:38,590 --> 05:33:40,750
We are like getting to the point.

5201
05:33:41,470 --> 05:33:42,669
I'm not going anywhere.

5202
05:33:45,209 --> 05:33:46,169
But just in general,

5203
05:33:46,169 --> 05:33:48,490
we're like at that halfway point of the whole game.

5204
05:33:49,049 --> 05:33:50,090
We're trying pausing it.

5205
05:33:55,049 --> 05:33:55,529
What's wrong?

5206
05:33:56,490 --> 05:34:00,729
Like my characters, there's no, I can't control anybody.

5207
05:34:00,729 --> 05:34:02,729
There's a stationary shot.

5208
05:34:02,729 --> 05:34:05,130
Alex is trying to become into the wall.

5209
05:34:09,529 --> 05:34:10,650
Am I being pranked?

5210
05:34:11,930 --> 05:34:12,810
I don't think so.

5211
05:34:13,450 --> 05:34:14,490
It happened to me before too.

5212
05:34:17,720 --> 05:34:22,459
Because I, maybe if I just get to the end of this area

5213
05:34:22,459 --> 05:34:23,900
and you get forced into a cutscene.

5214
05:34:42,400 --> 05:34:43,439
It's just frozen.

5215
05:34:46,750 --> 05:34:48,189
And then we walk this way and then.

5216
05:34:50,459 --> 05:34:51,659
These fucking places.

5217
05:34:55,419 --> 05:34:55,659
Okay.

5218
05:34:56,299 --> 05:34:59,709
Touch hat, touch hat.

5219
05:34:59,709 --> 05:35:00,349
No, I can't.

5220
05:35:00,349 --> 05:35:00,830
Sorry, Jeff.

5221
05:35:06,810 --> 05:35:09,680
Okay.

5222
05:35:09,680 --> 05:35:10,080
Question.

5223
05:35:10,080 --> 05:35:13,439
Do you think if you push start on man of Medan?

5224
05:35:16,279 --> 05:35:16,759
Hold on.

5225
05:35:17,950 --> 05:35:18,830
If I press start.

5226
05:35:19,549 --> 05:35:20,119
No, no, no.

5227
05:35:20,119 --> 05:35:20,520
Not you.

5228
05:35:20,520 --> 05:35:22,360
Like if, like if you started a new game

5229
05:35:23,259 --> 05:35:25,659
and then walked away from the controller and came back,

5230
05:35:25,659 --> 05:35:27,580
would it be at the credits without you doing anything?

5231
05:35:29,419 --> 05:35:30,619
I don't, maybe.

5232
05:35:30,619 --> 05:35:31,419
Depends on what you mean.

5233
05:35:31,419 --> 05:35:33,020
Like the computer will do it for you.

5234
05:35:33,659 --> 05:35:37,580
Like will they force you through each segment of the story

5235
05:35:37,580 --> 05:35:38,939
after a certain amount of time

5236
05:35:38,939 --> 05:35:42,939
without you having to physically touch the controller?

5237
05:35:42,939 --> 05:35:45,580
It's possible because there is a movie version of the game.

5238
05:35:46,700 --> 05:35:48,860
You know, it's shared movie experience.

5239
05:35:48,860 --> 05:35:51,259
So I have to imagine that it's built into the game somehow.

5240
05:35:52,700 --> 05:35:54,810
Christ.

5241
05:35:54,810 --> 05:35:55,529
Oh Christ.

5242
05:35:56,169 --> 05:35:58,009
That guy.

5243
05:35:58,009 --> 05:35:59,689
That guy's probably still right here with us.

5244
05:36:00,330 --> 05:36:02,650
I mean, you die on a ship.

5245
05:36:02,650 --> 05:36:03,849
Your ghost stays on the ship.

5246
05:36:03,849 --> 05:36:08,220
I'm telling you, if I'm a ghost, I ain't fucking sticking around.

5247
05:36:08,220 --> 05:36:09,340
You know what I mean?

5248
05:36:09,340 --> 05:36:10,779
I'm going to be going on a ghost vacation.

5249
05:36:20,159 --> 05:36:20,799
I remember that.

5250
05:36:20,799 --> 05:36:21,439
I remember that.

5251
05:36:21,439 --> 05:36:23,040
I remember when I did that, that was that we're about,

5252
05:36:23,040 --> 05:36:25,360
we're about 67% of the way through the game

5253
05:36:25,360 --> 05:36:30,680
because it was at that point in the game.

5254
05:36:30,680 --> 05:36:31,880
Even better the second time around.

5255
05:36:32,439 --> 05:36:48,279
Oh, okay.

5256
05:36:48,279 --> 05:36:49,400
This is where he goes, no.

5257
05:37:00,919 --> 05:37:05,709
You all right, dude?

5258
05:37:07,580 --> 05:37:08,060
Look out.

5259
05:37:08,779 --> 05:37:11,099
Shoot it.

5260
05:37:11,099 --> 05:37:12,060
It's right around the corner.

5261
05:37:12,700 --> 05:37:13,340
I'm going to get it.

5262
05:37:18,380 --> 05:37:21,759
Okay.

5263
05:37:21,759 --> 05:37:22,479
What just happened?

5264
05:37:23,279 --> 05:37:24,810
I don't know.

5265
05:37:24,810 --> 05:37:25,130
All right.

5266
05:37:26,009 --> 05:37:28,080
Let's go.

5267
05:37:28,639 --> 05:37:33,639
It's time for someone to die.

5268
05:37:34,360 --> 05:37:37,900
Is it going to be me or is it going to be Italics?

5269
05:37:37,900 --> 05:37:38,619
That's the question.

5270
05:37:38,619 --> 05:37:41,369
Hey, what?

5271
05:37:41,369 --> 05:37:42,970
I am actively going to try to kill Italics.

5272
05:37:42,970 --> 05:37:44,090
Come on, we should keep moving.

5273
05:37:44,090 --> 05:37:45,840
Is my Italics is still stuck?

5274
05:37:46,479 --> 05:37:48,959
Hold on.

5275
05:37:48,959 --> 05:37:49,919
You're still stuck?

5276
05:37:54,090 --> 05:37:54,729
Yeah.

5277
05:37:54,729 --> 05:37:58,090
Somebody in chat said that the only way that they could fix it

5278
05:37:58,090 --> 05:38:00,569
is by re-inviting someone to their game.

5279
05:38:02,810 --> 05:38:03,049
Wait.

5280
05:38:03,049 --> 05:38:05,130
That's why I was asking, hey, if you didn't do anything,

5281
05:38:05,130 --> 05:38:06,650
do you think the game would complete itself?

5282
05:38:06,650 --> 05:38:09,290
Because I was wondering if you would just by yourself

5283
05:38:09,290 --> 05:38:11,610
able to advance the law.

5284
05:38:11,610 --> 05:38:14,250
You're definitely going to have to be pulled in here soon.

5285
05:38:14,250 --> 05:38:15,930
I'm like almost at the point where you have to be.

5286
05:38:16,650 --> 05:38:19,290
Well, I'm at the very beginning of when we took control.

5287
05:38:19,849 --> 05:38:21,049
And you're just standing there?

5288
05:38:22,090 --> 05:38:24,169
If you look closely on my screen on the left side,

5289
05:38:24,169 --> 05:38:28,569
you can see the calves of Alex walking into the wall

5290
05:38:29,209 --> 05:38:30,090
over and over again.

5291
05:38:31,689 --> 05:38:33,130
I'm curious of what happens here then.

5292
05:38:33,130 --> 05:38:40,240
I also did this at a portion of the actual playthrough.

5293
05:38:40,240 --> 05:38:42,000
And you did you like me to the next scene.

5294
05:38:42,000 --> 05:38:43,119
It was very abrupt.

5295
05:38:43,119 --> 05:38:44,319
Well, let's see what happens.

5296
05:38:44,319 --> 05:38:45,119
That's about to happen.

5297
05:38:45,919 --> 05:38:52,669
There you go.

5298
05:38:53,630 --> 05:38:54,430
This part here.

5299
05:38:55,630 --> 05:38:55,950
Look.

5300
05:38:55,950 --> 05:38:56,830
Oh, what's that?

5301
05:38:56,830 --> 05:38:58,349
Oh, no, there's something here.

5302
05:39:03,450 --> 05:39:04,569
So funny story.

5303
05:39:04,569 --> 05:39:07,529
We've already missed, despite trying our best,

5304
05:39:07,529 --> 05:39:10,569
two guaranteed opportunities to kill a character.

5305
05:39:11,369 --> 05:39:11,849
What are they?

5306
05:39:12,810 --> 05:39:17,209
Uh, the first one is drink the beer after the decompression.

5307
05:39:17,209 --> 05:39:21,689
And I was silent on the beer, so I did not drink it.

5308
05:39:21,689 --> 05:39:23,930
She also doesn't die until the end of the game.

5309
05:39:23,930 --> 05:39:27,209
If you do that, who would do that?

5310
05:39:28,330 --> 05:39:32,009
First of all, you have to be reckless to swim up to the surface without decompressing.

5311
05:39:32,009 --> 05:39:35,130
And second, they give you like a public service announcement

5312
05:39:35,130 --> 05:39:39,369
sponsored by the government about why you shouldn't drink beer

5313
05:39:39,930 --> 05:39:42,650
because they probably didn't want someone to watch this game.

5314
05:39:43,369 --> 05:39:45,450
And it's like a don't try this at home moment.

5315
05:39:48,720 --> 05:39:50,799
So what's in the beer?

5316
05:39:51,840 --> 05:39:58,959
Well, the beer reacts with the bins or whatever that you get from decompression.

5317
05:40:01,520 --> 05:40:08,560
If you get the bins and you drink beer, you're just basically gonna die eventually.

5318
05:40:08,560 --> 05:40:09,119
Just don't do it.

5319
05:40:09,680 --> 05:40:13,279
All right, well, I'm currently being choked.

5320
05:40:17,209 --> 05:40:22,090
The second way is, you know, when they do the thunder window escape,

5321
05:40:22,090 --> 05:40:26,090
you actually have to succeed at opening the window.

5322
05:40:26,090 --> 05:40:33,479
So Conrad can die on the boat.

5323
05:40:41,630 --> 05:40:44,750
The best part about this is you explaining the scenes.

5324
05:40:46,270 --> 05:40:47,630
Oh, fuck off, game.

5325
05:40:47,630 --> 05:40:49,310
I have no idea what you're doing.

5326
05:40:49,310 --> 05:40:50,110
Fuck this game.

5327
05:40:51,069 --> 05:40:55,259
I mean, you don't have to tell me twice.

5328
05:40:56,619 --> 05:40:57,340
I'm stuck here.

5329
05:41:36,569 --> 05:41:37,689
Failed the second QTE.

5330
05:41:38,490 --> 05:41:39,849
That zombie grabbed me.

5331
05:41:39,849 --> 05:41:42,009
Then I might get my face pulled into the ground.

5332
05:41:42,729 --> 05:41:48,729
And then third attempt for a QTE, zombie comes out of the ground and grabs my face.

5333
05:41:48,729 --> 05:41:50,090
Like, I'm gonna break your neck.

5334
05:41:50,090 --> 05:41:52,889
Like, I'm literally murdering you.

5335
05:41:52,889 --> 05:41:56,889
Last chance for a QTE, like, he does like a, you're dead thing.

5336
05:41:56,889 --> 05:41:59,450
And then it goes to black and it just shows her line on the ground.

5337
05:41:59,450 --> 05:42:01,209
And then it cuts back up from black and I go,

5338
05:42:03,450 --> 05:42:05,580
it was like three or four QTEs that I failed.

5339
05:42:05,580 --> 05:42:06,860
And then I was like dead on the ground.

5340
05:42:07,500 --> 05:42:10,779
Yeah, I failed four underwater with no oxygen mask.

5341
05:42:11,900 --> 05:42:12,299
We're live.

5342
05:42:12,299 --> 05:42:13,580
And the zombies aren't real though.

5343
05:42:13,580 --> 05:42:14,139
That's true.

5344
05:42:14,779 --> 05:42:23,000
They are an illusion.

5345
05:42:23,000 --> 05:42:23,479
That is true.

5346
05:42:23,479 --> 05:42:24,200
That is an illusion.

5347
05:42:24,200 --> 05:42:24,520
All right.

5348
05:42:24,520 --> 05:42:25,319
Are you, are you back?

5349
05:42:25,880 --> 05:42:26,119
Yeah.

5350
05:42:27,099 --> 05:42:28,139
All right, guys, welcome back.

5351
05:42:28,939 --> 05:42:29,580
Here we go.

5352
05:42:29,580 --> 05:42:30,060
Are you ready?

5353
05:42:31,659 --> 05:42:32,700
Here's the decision to make.

5354
05:42:32,700 --> 05:42:34,700
Compelling gameplay going on over here.

5355
05:42:59,340 --> 05:42:59,900
How are you doing?

5356
05:43:01,529 --> 05:43:02,810
Oh, I'm chilling.

5357
05:43:02,810 --> 05:43:03,849
You're still stuck?

5358
05:43:04,650 --> 05:43:06,330
Yeah, no, I'm good.

5359
05:43:06,330 --> 05:43:07,849
How the hell does this play out then?

5360
05:43:08,810 --> 05:43:10,009
I don't know, but I ain't moving.

5361
05:43:12,459 --> 05:43:14,459
Because this is a new, are you still Alex?

5362
05:43:14,459 --> 05:43:15,259
It's me and Julia.

5363
05:43:16,669 --> 05:43:17,310
You're still Alex.

5364
05:43:17,310 --> 05:43:18,669
Alex and Julia are here.

5365
05:43:18,669 --> 05:43:23,709
I don't, yeah, Alex, I'm supposed to be Alex, but Alex is walking into the wall.

5366
05:43:25,229 --> 05:43:26,349
He's just going, man.

5367
05:43:29,439 --> 05:43:30,400
So what?

5368
05:43:31,119 --> 05:43:33,759
Keep your head on straight.

5369
05:43:33,759 --> 05:43:34,560
So what?

5370
05:43:35,200 --> 05:43:36,799
Who's going to try to come after me?

5371
05:43:38,159 --> 05:43:40,400
I'm curious how this is going to work because you.

5372
05:43:40,400 --> 05:43:41,599
Well, Brad's gone.

5373
05:43:41,599 --> 05:43:44,080
So wherever Brad is, he's off on his own.

5374
05:43:45,119 --> 05:43:50,119
You should have been yoinked by now.

5375
05:43:50,680 --> 05:43:52,919
Are you just playing the game against the AI?

5376
05:43:53,720 --> 05:43:56,439
I mean, technically you're supposed to come in now, right?

5377
05:43:59,610 --> 05:44:02,090
Um, I don't know.

5378
05:44:02,090 --> 05:44:06,970
I think technically, you know that Conrad can die on the boat if you fail the right QTE.

5379
05:44:06,970 --> 05:44:07,770
Stick to the script.

5380
05:44:07,770 --> 05:44:08,009
Okay.

5381
05:44:08,810 --> 05:44:11,630
All right.

5382
05:44:11,630 --> 05:44:12,509
I'm going to stick to the script.

5383
05:44:18,840 --> 05:44:20,520
It's like hard to die in this game.

5384
05:44:20,520 --> 05:44:24,040
I'm like reading all the ways to kill people and it's it's like a challenge.

5385
05:44:24,680 --> 05:44:26,360
I feel like I'm looking up the achievement guide.

5386
05:44:28,700 --> 05:44:29,819
Don't go outside.

5387
05:44:29,819 --> 05:44:30,220
Why not?

5388
05:44:32,650 --> 05:44:34,759
I got bad news.

5389
05:44:34,759 --> 05:44:35,959
Do you have any spoiler for you?

5390
05:44:38,750 --> 05:44:43,229
The next opportunity for a character to die is not until we get to play as Fliss.

5391
05:44:44,189 --> 05:44:45,389
I mean, I am Fliss.

5392
05:44:46,029 --> 05:44:46,909
Oh, yeah.

5393
05:44:47,790 --> 05:44:49,500
Maybe that's what I didn't know.

5394
05:44:49,500 --> 05:44:50,540
Don't go outside.

5395
05:44:51,099 --> 05:44:53,180
Don't don't don't don't don't go outside.

5396
05:44:53,180 --> 05:44:53,580
Why not?

5397
05:44:57,880 --> 05:44:58,599
Don't go outside.

5398
05:44:58,599 --> 05:44:59,159
Go to the door.

5399
05:44:59,159 --> 05:45:00,040
Women don't go outside.

5400
05:45:03,130 --> 05:45:04,250
Don't open this again.

5401
05:45:04,250 --> 05:45:05,450
I'm trying to pull him into the game.

5402
05:45:06,169 --> 05:45:06,490
Oops.

5403
05:45:07,130 --> 05:45:11,529
Someone said pause and unpause, but that didn't change or disconnect my controller.

5404
05:45:14,779 --> 05:45:16,459
Just fuck around for a while.

5405
05:45:16,459 --> 05:45:16,700
What?

5406
05:45:23,529 --> 05:45:24,169
Don't do it.

5407
05:45:25,450 --> 05:45:26,250
Don't go aside.

5408
05:45:27,049 --> 05:45:30,279
What do you mean I can die if I go out there?

5409
05:45:30,279 --> 05:45:31,159
Isn't that the point?

5410
05:45:31,799 --> 05:45:44,590
So what the fuck do you want me to do?

5411
05:45:48,599 --> 05:45:50,279
You won't die if you go outside.

5412
05:45:52,270 --> 05:45:52,509
All right.

5413
05:45:52,509 --> 05:45:53,790
So what what do you mean stay?

5414
05:45:53,790 --> 05:45:55,229
What if I stay inside?

5415
05:45:55,229 --> 05:45:59,000
But then how am I going to pull italics into the game?

5416
05:46:03,689 --> 05:46:06,009
I feel like I've been streaming for 14 hours.

5417
05:46:08,119 --> 05:46:08,680
You know what I mean?

5418
05:46:08,680 --> 05:46:10,840
Like it's just I'm finally got pulled.

5419
05:46:11,869 --> 05:46:12,590
Thank God.

5420
05:46:14,970 --> 05:46:17,930
And like Twitch's servers are like getting shit on.

5421
05:46:17,930 --> 05:46:18,729
That's what I mean.

5422
05:46:19,610 --> 05:46:25,659
I'm just going outside.

5423
05:46:27,500 --> 05:46:28,139
I'm going for it.

5424
05:46:28,139 --> 05:46:29,659
I'm finally get to play.

5425
05:46:29,659 --> 05:46:31,340
We need to italics has to play.

5426
05:46:32,139 --> 05:46:35,819
I'm I am playing just now.

5427
05:46:42,299 --> 05:46:43,500
I'm in the room with the poison.

5428
05:46:43,500 --> 05:46:46,459
Yeah, but don't doesn't he need to come up here?

5429
05:46:47,259 --> 05:46:51,709
Remember this?

5430
05:46:51,709 --> 05:46:51,950
All right.

5431
05:46:51,950 --> 05:46:54,119
Do I do I have anything I can do?

5432
05:46:56,970 --> 05:46:57,290
All right.

5433
05:46:57,290 --> 05:47:01,790
Do the do the McDonald's menu tier list.

5434
05:47:02,509 --> 05:47:04,040
Hang on.

5435
05:47:04,040 --> 05:47:08,680
I finally get to be Brad and see what was supposed to happen the first time.

5436
05:47:09,400 --> 05:47:09,639
What?

5437
05:47:12,569 --> 05:47:14,729
This is where I went AFK in the original playthrough.

5438
05:47:14,729 --> 05:47:17,950
And I want I want to know how this new content.

5439
05:47:19,209 --> 05:47:31,610
Never before seen DLC of Brad eat the berries, eat the berries.

5440
05:47:32,650 --> 05:47:36,110
There are no berries here.

5441
05:47:43,099 --> 05:47:45,500
Hey, Brad, I am Brad.

5442
05:47:48,650 --> 05:47:50,569
Remember when you were like, hey, are you Brad?

5443
05:47:50,569 --> 05:47:51,369
That was so funny.

5444
05:47:52,250 --> 05:47:53,369
It was though.

5445
05:47:53,369 --> 05:47:54,330
It was pretty funny.

5446
05:47:55,799 --> 05:47:57,159
Everyone was so mad.

5447
05:47:57,880 --> 05:48:09,279
Wait, are you Fliss right now?

5448
05:48:09,279 --> 05:48:09,520
Yes.

5449
05:48:10,319 --> 05:48:11,759
Did you just silence treatment me?

5450
05:48:12,860 --> 05:48:13,419
In the game?

5451
05:48:14,139 --> 05:48:14,380
Yeah.

5452
05:48:15,919 --> 05:48:16,240
Huh?

5453
05:48:17,979 --> 05:48:18,939
What are you talking about?

5454
05:48:18,939 --> 05:48:20,380
If you didn't just talk to Brad.

5455
05:48:24,319 --> 05:48:26,080
Oh, I didn't get to see this last time.

5456
05:48:27,880 --> 05:48:29,240
This part actually would have been cool.

5457
05:48:32,380 --> 05:48:35,580
See, you would have asked me that same question.

5458
05:48:35,580 --> 05:48:36,380
You see chat.

5459
05:48:37,180 --> 05:48:38,459
He just asked that question.

5460
05:48:38,459 --> 05:48:40,540
But I already know how it goes down.

5461
05:48:40,540 --> 05:48:43,819
Yeah, but if you didn't know that how it went down and you're like, hey.

5462
05:48:46,119 --> 05:48:48,599
Listen, here's the facts are I didn't know.

5463
05:48:50,360 --> 05:48:53,560
At this point in the game, I didn't know that it was just not a monster.

5464
05:48:54,119 --> 05:48:56,279
By the way, I'm actually real human.

5465
05:48:56,279 --> 05:48:59,479
I just thought you had come into control of the monsters

5466
05:48:59,479 --> 05:49:01,319
and we're playing as the bad guys now.

5467
05:49:01,319 --> 05:49:04,680
Oh, I thought that would have been a cool way to do it.

5468
05:49:04,680 --> 05:49:07,560
Where one of the players gets infected by the mist

5469
05:49:08,520 --> 05:49:10,680
and you're now the antagonist trying to like

5470
05:49:11,240 --> 05:49:14,330
dungeon master the other person's game.

5471
05:49:14,330 --> 05:49:16,169
Guys, I can't eat any fucking food.

5472
05:49:16,169 --> 05:49:17,290
What are you talking about?

5473
05:49:18,009 --> 05:49:18,330
Food?

5474
05:49:20,349 --> 05:49:22,029
I can't eat the food on the table.

5475
05:49:22,029 --> 05:49:23,869
It doesn't have a glowy thing on it.

5476
05:49:23,869 --> 05:49:26,330
This food cart.

5477
05:49:26,330 --> 05:49:27,130
What do you want me to eat?

5478
05:49:27,930 --> 05:49:33,529
All right.

5479
05:49:33,529 --> 05:49:36,810
So I think it actually turns out I picked the right point to go AFK

5480
05:49:36,810 --> 05:49:38,569
because I don't think anything happens in here.

5481
05:49:39,209 --> 05:49:40,729
I think this is just.

5482
05:49:40,729 --> 05:49:41,849
Oh, wait, maybe it does.

5483
05:49:41,849 --> 05:49:47,099
I think I have to spin the bullet.

5484
05:49:47,099 --> 05:49:51,979
What are you doing?

5485
05:49:52,700 --> 05:49:53,900
No, not you like this.

5486
05:49:54,700 --> 05:50:07,639
There's another food cart.

5487
05:50:08,959 --> 05:50:10,080
There's no food carts.

5488
05:50:21,259 --> 05:50:23,520
Oh, wait, what?

5489
05:50:24,250 --> 05:50:25,529
I still don't understand.

5490
05:50:27,470 --> 05:50:29,069
And I'm here for it this time.

5491
05:50:29,950 --> 05:50:36,509
Jolly Jack.

5492
05:50:36,509 --> 05:50:37,709
I actually am.

5493
05:50:37,709 --> 05:50:38,909
This may be more confused.

5494
05:50:45,290 --> 05:50:53,900
It's really kind of annoying that they have to replace that every day.

5495
05:50:54,939 --> 05:50:59,259
I mean, that's a cool gimmick, but somebody has to replace all that every day for a quarter.

5496
05:51:00,220 --> 05:51:00,540
Oof.

5497
05:51:02,569 --> 05:51:03,529
Actual nightmare.

5498
05:51:04,250 --> 05:51:20,700
And no berries, guys.

5499
05:51:32,750 --> 05:51:34,669
You guys are fucking with me.

5500
05:51:39,419 --> 05:51:41,900
There's a food cart with thousands of berries on it.

5501
05:51:44,139 --> 05:51:45,659
You are full of shit.

5502
05:51:58,619 --> 05:52:18,279
Back left of the room, north left, left.

5503
05:52:18,279 --> 05:52:23,000
What direction do you think I'm walking at the moment?

5504
05:52:23,000 --> 05:52:42,919
It was all just a dream.

5505
05:52:43,560 --> 05:52:44,680
How do I do this?

5506
05:52:45,400 --> 05:52:48,040
You went AFK during the looping dream segment.

5507
05:52:48,759 --> 05:52:49,479
Is that what you did?

5508
05:52:50,279 --> 05:52:50,520
Yeah.

5509
05:52:51,389 --> 05:52:52,669
That's so funny.

5510
05:52:52,669 --> 05:52:54,509
This is the part that I like missed before.

5511
05:52:58,669 --> 05:53:01,549
And this is what it transitioned into, I think.

5512
05:53:01,549 --> 05:53:03,389
So then do I just have to wait for you to get up here?

5513
05:53:13,389 --> 05:53:15,709
Probably, because that's what yoinked me.

5514
05:53:15,709 --> 05:53:18,110
I mean, I did the thing I was supposed to do this time and it didn't.

5515
05:53:18,110 --> 05:53:19,549
Nothing different happened.

5516
05:53:19,549 --> 05:53:20,830
So now I'm going to open the door.

5517
05:53:21,630 --> 05:53:22,029
Yeah.

5518
05:53:22,029 --> 05:53:23,470
Now I have to kill you.

5519
05:53:23,470 --> 05:53:23,709
Yes.

5520
05:53:24,590 --> 05:53:29,040
So now I have to just like leave.

5521
05:53:29,759 --> 05:53:33,639
Okay.

5522
05:53:34,360 --> 05:53:35,240
Here we go.

5523
05:53:35,240 --> 05:53:37,400
I think I end up jumping off here anyways.

5524
05:53:38,919 --> 05:53:43,240
I just did it myself instead of make you scare me into jumping.

5525
05:53:44,279 --> 05:53:48,810
This is a nice speed run tactic.

5526
05:53:49,610 --> 05:53:51,529
Okay.

5527
05:53:51,529 --> 05:53:51,770
So.

5528
05:53:54,830 --> 05:53:55,069
All right.

5529
05:53:55,069 --> 05:53:55,549
That's you.

5530
05:53:56,270 --> 05:53:58,139
What was that close up?

5531
05:53:59,099 --> 05:54:04,009
Except you're like a zambie with a fist bump.

5532
05:54:17,720 --> 05:54:18,279
You didn't wait.

5533
05:54:18,279 --> 05:54:19,560
You didn't look like this before.

5534
05:54:21,790 --> 05:54:22,029
What?

5535
05:54:26,810 --> 05:54:27,930
What just happened?

5536
05:54:27,930 --> 05:54:29,130
You didn't look like that before.

5537
05:54:29,689 --> 05:54:30,810
Did you just mess it up?

5538
05:54:32,029 --> 05:54:32,430
No.

5539
05:54:32,430 --> 05:54:32,669
What?

5540
05:54:33,389 --> 05:54:37,080
I didn't even get a chance.

5541
05:54:38,409 --> 05:54:42,119
It's because I stayed in the room.

5542
05:54:46,520 --> 05:54:46,840
Wow.

5543
05:54:46,840 --> 05:54:48,599
It's really hard to kill people in this game.

5544
05:54:51,319 --> 05:54:52,759
Neither of you found a weapon.

5545
05:54:53,799 --> 05:54:58,299
So I didn't find a weapon so I couldn't kill you.

5546
05:55:07,209 --> 05:55:09,049
It seems like speed running is the best way.

5547
05:55:09,049 --> 05:55:10,169
Like fail everything.

5548
05:55:10,169 --> 05:55:10,729
Don't talk.

5549
05:55:11,450 --> 05:55:13,290
Keep going and you just will win.

5550
05:55:13,290 --> 05:55:15,450
Except maybe you won't save the boat.

5551
05:55:15,450 --> 05:55:17,369
I killed this person.

5552
05:55:32,970 --> 05:55:35,130
We're just playing it perfectly again.

5553
05:55:36,009 --> 05:55:37,630
We're just doing it again.

5554
05:55:37,630 --> 05:55:48,479
And I got up to like, yeah, you better run.

5555
05:56:10,750 --> 05:56:10,990
All right.

5556
05:56:10,990 --> 05:56:12,110
I'm going to encourage him this time.

5557
05:56:20,319 --> 05:56:20,720
Do it.

5558
05:56:21,439 --> 05:56:21,759
Do it.

5559
05:56:22,319 --> 05:56:22,720
Do it.

5560
05:56:24,880 --> 05:56:34,759
I'm not convinced that he's dead.

5561
05:56:35,560 --> 05:56:36,040
He's not.

5562
05:56:36,040 --> 05:56:37,000
He wakes up at the end of the game.

5563
05:56:39,599 --> 05:56:40,880
Nothing changes.

5564
05:56:40,880 --> 05:56:45,360
The only character that died last playthrough is that character.

5565
05:57:00,220 --> 05:57:01,180
It's the same run.

5566
05:57:01,180 --> 05:57:01,900
Nothing changed.

5567
05:57:02,619 --> 05:57:03,099
No.

5568
05:57:03,099 --> 05:57:04,459
Nothing has changed so far.

5569
05:57:04,459 --> 05:57:06,139
Somehow we're making the same choices.

5570
05:57:12,319 --> 05:57:14,159
Although technically everyone did run.

5571
05:57:14,880 --> 05:57:17,080
We're just playing the game again.

5572
05:57:17,080 --> 05:57:18,200
A second time through.

5573
05:57:18,200 --> 05:57:19,000
Yeah, I know.

5574
05:57:21,000 --> 05:57:23,240
We just liked it so much we played it twice for the people

5575
05:57:23,240 --> 05:57:25,400
that couldn't make it to the first showing of the stream.

5576
05:57:26,520 --> 05:57:27,880
This is just a Twitch rerun.

5577
05:57:36,509 --> 05:57:39,229
We're watching our own stream again and reacting to it.

5578
05:57:39,229 --> 05:57:41,310
Yeah, we're just re-watching the stream.

5579
05:57:45,740 --> 05:57:47,020
Okay, can he kill us?

5580
05:57:47,020 --> 05:58:03,470
If we make a bunch of noise, he's an actor.

5581
05:58:05,500 --> 05:58:06,299
Who's he talking to?

5582
05:58:06,939 --> 05:58:10,380
So this is the Conrad.

5583
05:58:17,020 --> 05:58:18,700
So this wasn't in the blast?

5584
05:58:22,330 --> 05:58:26,090
So am I the player that has to run away from you both at times in a row?

5585
05:58:28,490 --> 05:58:30,009
Are you doing this right now?

5586
05:58:30,009 --> 05:58:30,409
I guess.

5587
05:58:31,689 --> 05:58:34,250
Are you like invisible person?

5588
05:58:36,650 --> 05:58:37,770
And then I start running?

5589
05:58:37,930 --> 05:58:38,430
Hey!

5590
05:58:44,330 --> 05:58:44,970
You mentioned this.

5591
05:58:44,970 --> 05:58:48,330
I know like the hey are you Brad is the meme of this stream.

5592
05:58:48,330 --> 05:58:50,729
But if we were on the couch playing this together,

5593
05:58:50,729 --> 05:58:52,009
how the fuck would this play out?

5594
05:58:52,959 --> 05:58:55,279
Did Star just join the call?

5595
05:59:00,139 --> 05:59:00,459
No?

5596
05:59:00,459 --> 05:59:00,959
What?

5597
05:59:06,330 --> 05:59:08,889
That definitely sounded like a, you know.

5598
05:59:10,599 --> 05:59:14,479
If all of us were on the couch, we should test it out.

5599
05:59:14,479 --> 05:59:16,400
Let's go plug this in and go on the couch.

5600
05:59:17,119 --> 05:59:18,080
Playthrough number three.

5601
05:59:27,500 --> 05:59:30,060
Where is the weapon?

5602
05:59:30,060 --> 05:59:32,459
I have to have a weapon or else no one's going to die in this run.

5603
05:59:33,419 --> 05:59:35,069
Can't go that way.

5604
05:59:37,790 --> 05:59:39,470
I don't know where the weapon is.

5605
05:59:46,680 --> 05:59:50,919
There was no reason for him to be going insane the first playthrough.

5606
05:59:50,919 --> 05:59:52,599
He hadn't even seen anything scary.

5607
05:59:52,599 --> 05:59:53,880
But what happens?

5608
05:59:54,919 --> 05:59:57,159
So the game just doesn't want the two people

5609
05:59:57,159 --> 05:59:58,840
to really be in communication with each other?

5610
05:59:58,840 --> 05:59:59,639
Because obviously it's going to be-

5611
05:59:59,639 --> 06:00:03,240
I guess that's the whole point is like play co-op but don't talk to the other person.

5612
06:00:03,240 --> 06:00:06,680
Because then it's like, oh hey dude, are you like on the stairs?

5613
06:00:06,680 --> 06:00:07,000
No.

5614
06:00:07,000 --> 06:00:14,200
That's why a way out was so fun because you had to communicate until the end of the game.

5615
06:00:14,200 --> 06:00:16,200
And then it was like, all right, let's not talk to each other

5616
06:00:16,200 --> 06:00:18,200
because it's obvious we're not supposed to.

5617
06:00:21,819 --> 06:00:22,939
And then the game was over.

5618
06:00:22,939 --> 06:00:24,860
It's meant to be played online with strangers?

5619
06:00:25,740 --> 06:00:26,939
There's an invite button.

5620
06:00:27,580 --> 06:00:29,099
And don't play alone.

5621
06:00:29,099 --> 06:00:30,220
To your friends list.

5622
06:00:35,470 --> 06:00:36,669
What the fuck am I doing?

5623
06:00:37,389 --> 06:00:38,669
I like lost all track.

5624
06:00:39,229 --> 06:00:48,700
Is there a puzzle here?

5625
06:00:49,740 --> 06:00:50,939
Oh right, I gotta get that.

5626
06:00:50,939 --> 06:00:51,740
I forgot the key.

5627
06:00:52,540 --> 06:00:55,930
I think I have you trapped because I knew the key.

5628
06:00:56,650 --> 06:01:00,750
If there's a key, there's a lock.

5629
06:01:06,520 --> 06:01:07,799
I have to do something.

5630
06:01:07,799 --> 06:01:08,520
No, I do.

5631
06:01:08,520 --> 06:01:10,200
Because I'm like, I'm holding you back.

5632
06:01:11,080 --> 06:01:13,279
Well, I knew that.

5633
06:01:13,279 --> 06:01:16,169
But besides that, do I have to look for beer?

5634
06:01:16,169 --> 06:01:19,930
Why is she standing here?

5635
06:01:19,930 --> 06:01:24,799
There's no berries on the desk.

5636
06:01:34,009 --> 06:01:37,849
So you really are supposed to be like, hey man, you want to play Man of Medan?

5637
06:01:37,849 --> 06:01:38,490
Yeah.

5638
06:01:38,490 --> 06:01:39,849
Oh yeah, there's like a co-op mode.

5639
06:01:39,849 --> 06:01:40,330
It's cool.

5640
06:01:41,369 --> 06:01:43,290
Okay, I'll talk to you in like four hours.

5641
06:01:45,369 --> 06:01:45,930
Not that many.

5642
06:01:47,130 --> 06:01:52,299
Four is being very generous.

5643
06:01:52,299 --> 06:01:52,860
That is true.

5644
06:01:53,979 --> 06:01:55,180
All right, so I got the thing.

5645
06:01:55,180 --> 06:02:00,889
And now I have to forget like the progression here.

5646
06:02:00,889 --> 06:02:02,009
I can't leave from here?

5647
06:02:04,729 --> 06:02:07,610
I'm not sure if there's a moment in the game where you're waiting on me.

5648
06:02:08,169 --> 06:02:08,569
Am I?

5649
06:02:09,209 --> 06:02:21,020
Because I'm just kind of existing in this room.

5650
06:02:21,979 --> 06:02:25,200
Okay.

5651
06:02:29,279 --> 06:02:31,040
You eating a gogurt?

5652
06:02:31,680 --> 06:02:33,229
That's what it looked like.

5653
06:02:39,560 --> 06:02:40,599
Oh, where's the candle?

5654
06:02:41,560 --> 06:02:42,680
You, am I waiting for you?

5655
06:02:43,400 --> 06:02:45,159
Oh, the game showed me because I'm too dumb.

5656
06:02:45,159 --> 06:02:46,279
Now you're waiting for me.

5657
06:02:46,279 --> 06:02:46,919
Oh, okay.

5658
06:02:49,689 --> 06:02:51,130
I'm waiting for you to get a candle?

5659
06:02:51,930 --> 06:02:57,069
And it has to spook me.

5660
06:03:06,080 --> 06:03:06,639
What can I do here?

5661
06:03:06,639 --> 06:03:07,279
Can I look at this?

5662
06:03:07,919 --> 06:03:19,279
There ain't nothing on here.

5663
06:03:20,509 --> 06:03:21,790
Water purification.

5664
06:03:23,389 --> 06:03:26,439
Headed to San Francisco?

5665
06:03:26,439 --> 06:03:27,560
Berry's spotted.

5666
06:03:28,439 --> 06:03:31,880
I think if you play this in, um, what happens if I fail this QD?

5667
06:03:32,759 --> 06:03:33,159
Fail it.

5668
06:03:35,790 --> 06:03:40,380
Ah, was that me running after me into a room with me?

5669
06:03:46,700 --> 06:03:47,180
Right?

5670
06:03:47,180 --> 06:03:49,259
Okay, so we're currently...

5671
06:03:54,220 --> 06:03:54,860
There you are.

5672
06:03:56,459 --> 06:03:57,979
Why are you so sexy though?

5673
06:03:57,979 --> 06:03:59,419
You found me.

5674
06:03:59,419 --> 06:04:00,220
You found me.

5675
06:04:01,630 --> 06:04:02,430
Good work.

5676
06:04:12,090 --> 06:04:13,369
So what's happening on your side?

5677
06:04:13,369 --> 06:04:14,889
Are you just whispering in my ear?

5678
06:04:14,889 --> 06:04:17,689
No, you, I'm just standing completely still.

5679
06:04:18,490 --> 06:04:20,009
And you're scared of me.

5680
06:04:21,720 --> 06:04:23,720
Well, you're not standing completely still for me.

5681
06:04:25,560 --> 06:04:26,360
Just kill me.

5682
06:04:29,639 --> 06:04:30,520
Bart, get over here.

5683
06:04:30,520 --> 06:04:31,799
Here's a great QT's coming up.

5684
06:04:34,439 --> 06:04:34,939
Don't.

5685
06:04:44,279 --> 06:04:46,060
I won't, I get up.

5686
06:04:46,779 --> 06:04:47,279
He's just...

5687
06:04:51,689 --> 06:04:53,849
Hey, uh, you failed too many times.

5688
06:04:53,849 --> 06:04:54,889
So we gotta just throw you.

5689
06:04:57,470 --> 06:05:05,560
This is so, this is so funny.

5690
06:05:08,540 --> 06:05:09,819
It's me, it's Blitz.

5691
06:05:12,060 --> 06:05:13,580
Did I trap your hand in the door?

5692
06:05:14,380 --> 06:05:14,880
No.

5693
06:05:15,740 --> 06:05:19,020
Well then, what stopped the door?

5694
06:05:19,819 --> 06:05:20,700
You closed it.

5695
06:05:21,580 --> 06:05:22,060
You closed the door.

5696
06:05:22,060 --> 06:05:23,020
But your hand was in it.

5697
06:05:23,020 --> 06:05:24,299
Somebody's hand was in it.

5698
06:05:26,430 --> 06:05:27,389
Oh my god.

5699
06:05:28,509 --> 06:05:29,869
That was a fucking mess.

5700
06:05:30,669 --> 06:05:39,389
The game is having trouble trying to figure out where,

5701
06:05:39,389 --> 06:05:42,110
what to do because we're doing this so fucking wrong.

5702
06:05:45,150 --> 06:05:45,650
What?

5703
06:05:46,349 --> 06:05:47,950
Did you just teleport?

5704
06:05:47,950 --> 06:05:48,430
I just saw...

5705
06:05:49,069 --> 06:05:49,950
What is happening?

5706
06:05:51,119 --> 06:05:51,919
Did I just go in?

5707
06:05:51,919 --> 06:05:53,040
Hey, he's done it.

5708
06:05:53,040 --> 06:05:56,880
Ladies and gentlemen, all it took was seven failed QT's in a row.

5709
06:06:06,799 --> 06:06:09,310
Did you finally see the cut scene?

5710
06:06:10,430 --> 06:06:10,930
No.

5711
06:06:12,270 --> 06:06:13,389
The cut scene was amazing.

5712
06:06:14,430 --> 06:06:17,630
I looked down and you're just lying on your back.

5713
06:06:18,590 --> 06:06:20,189
You should see the, you should see the fall.

5714
06:06:22,270 --> 06:06:23,229
The fall was good.

5715
06:06:23,869 --> 06:06:25,389
Oh, my stomach.

5716
06:06:25,389 --> 06:06:27,389
I got first character kill.

5717
06:06:27,389 --> 06:06:32,830
I, oh my god.

5718
06:06:33,790 --> 06:06:37,689
All right, here we go.

5719
06:06:38,330 --> 06:06:39,069
Part two.

5720
06:06:40,169 --> 06:06:40,810
First blood.

5721
06:06:50,840 --> 06:06:51,340
He's here.

5722
06:07:02,990 --> 06:07:03,790
Through here, quick.

5723
06:07:06,560 --> 06:07:07,599
Hey, can you help me out?

5724
06:07:10,000 --> 06:07:10,799
Can you help me?

5725
06:07:10,799 --> 06:07:12,000
What was the point of that?

5726
06:07:12,959 --> 06:07:20,909
I didn't even, I didn't choose anything and I just helped you up anyway.

5727
06:07:25,930 --> 06:07:27,369
Run or jump or nothing?

5728
06:07:27,369 --> 06:07:28,250
Uh, neither.

5729
06:07:31,150 --> 06:07:31,869
Is he gone yet?

5730
06:07:35,599 --> 06:07:36,240
Did he just leave?

5731
06:07:36,240 --> 06:07:36,740
Nope.

5732
06:07:39,560 --> 06:07:40,680
Looks like we're jumping.

5733
06:07:41,560 --> 06:07:44,400
Hey, can you help me up again?

5734
06:07:45,119 --> 06:07:46,639
Nevermind, it looks like we're both down.

5735
06:07:48,080 --> 06:07:52,439
This is, to be fair, this is accurate to most horror movies though.

5736
06:07:54,560 --> 06:07:57,360
Yeah, but like failing every QTE is so difficult.

5737
06:07:58,000 --> 06:07:59,520
All he did is shove you down.

5738
06:07:59,520 --> 06:08:00,479
I thought, did he have a knife?

5739
06:08:01,119 --> 06:08:01,840
Where's his knife?

5740
06:08:02,560 --> 06:08:04,840
He just like checked you.

5741
06:08:08,279 --> 06:08:08,779
What?

5742
06:08:09,720 --> 06:08:11,080
He was in the room with us.

5743
06:08:12,939 --> 06:08:14,939
He walked inside of the room with us.

5744
06:08:15,740 --> 06:08:21,560
Yeah, it's me, come on, let's go.

5745
06:08:24,040 --> 06:08:25,959
Yeah, it's me, come on, let's go.

5746
06:08:30,360 --> 06:08:32,439
They played the stair cutscene twice.

5747
06:08:33,639 --> 06:08:47,259
All right, can they start dropping like flies here?

5748
06:08:47,259 --> 06:08:47,759
Let's see.

5749
06:08:53,150 --> 06:08:55,709
Imagine playing a horror game and you have to google how to die.

5750
06:08:57,020 --> 06:08:57,520
I think.

5751
06:08:58,459 --> 06:08:59,419
I know, right?

5752
06:08:59,419 --> 06:09:00,220
We'll be all right here.

5753
06:09:02,860 --> 06:09:04,060
Three people could be dead right now.

5754
06:09:04,060 --> 06:09:05,740
How could you fuck this up so badly?

5755
06:09:05,740 --> 06:09:11,310
We've failed every QTE and made every horrible decision.

5756
06:09:13,040 --> 06:09:16,259
Including not making decisions.

5757
06:09:16,259 --> 06:09:21,540
Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?

5758
06:09:21,540 --> 06:09:26,500
I think this game just rewards an indecisive characteristic.

5759
06:09:26,819 --> 06:09:32,180
If you just don't ever make any choices in your own life, everything will work itself out.

5760
06:09:32,180 --> 06:09:35,299
I was really hoping there was going to be like a bottle of alcohol in this book.

5761
06:09:35,299 --> 06:09:40,340
He, or rather you, should have been a bit less careless.

5762
06:09:41,380 --> 06:09:44,959
Have you figured out what's going on?

5763
06:09:45,520 --> 06:09:46,799
How to stop it?

5764
06:09:46,799 --> 06:09:50,400
How to save the lives of your poor unfortunate stowaways?

5765
06:09:50,400 --> 06:09:53,279
The poor unfortunate stowaways are chat at this point.

5766
06:09:54,240 --> 06:09:56,639
We're trying to save their lives by getting everyone killed.

5767
06:09:58,400 --> 06:10:04,099
The deaths that night.

5768
06:10:04,099 --> 06:10:05,540
Let me help you out.

5769
06:10:05,540 --> 06:10:06,819
Give you a little hint.

5770
06:10:06,819 --> 06:10:07,139
Please.

5771
06:10:09,630 --> 06:10:12,349
I still don't understand what's happening.

5772
06:10:12,349 --> 06:10:13,869
Are we looking for gold still?

5773
06:10:13,869 --> 06:10:15,150
You're a gold bars.

5774
06:10:16,669 --> 06:10:17,549
Who's the monster?

5775
06:10:18,189 --> 06:10:20,590
Well, then how are you?

5776
06:10:20,590 --> 06:10:23,389
Are you actually the maybe forces at play here?

5777
06:10:23,389 --> 06:10:24,909
Are you imitating chat?

5778
06:10:24,909 --> 06:10:25,389
Sign.

5779
06:10:25,389 --> 06:10:25,950
I'm asking.

5780
06:10:25,950 --> 06:10:29,869
I'm asking if it's even some of the more I don't understand.

5781
06:10:29,869 --> 06:10:32,990
I mean, that's supernatural.

5782
06:10:35,700 --> 06:10:38,340
Perhaps you've started to realize something.

5783
06:10:40,939 --> 06:10:41,580
Everything.

5784
06:10:41,580 --> 06:10:44,220
Perhaps you're starting to realize berries.

5785
06:10:44,220 --> 06:10:46,220
May not be quite what they appear to be.

5786
06:10:47,659 --> 06:10:52,419
I hope that helps.

5787
06:10:52,419 --> 06:10:55,779
Well, aren't you excited to find out what the poor unfortunate

5788
06:10:55,779 --> 06:11:01,299
for making of all this and how you might avoid any more unnecessary tragedy?

5789
06:11:01,299 --> 06:11:02,580
Nothing is as it seems.

5790
06:11:03,939 --> 06:11:05,139
Everything you see is a lie.

5791
06:11:06,590 --> 06:11:09,069
It's like very on the nose.

5792
06:11:10,779 --> 06:11:12,139
Everything's a lie.

5793
06:11:12,139 --> 06:11:13,020
Everything's a lie.

5794
06:11:14,700 --> 06:11:17,040
Okay, I cannot.

5795
06:11:17,040 --> 06:11:17,439
You know what?

5796
06:11:17,439 --> 06:11:18,319
I'm going to be real with you.

5797
06:11:18,319 --> 06:11:21,520
I really can't fucking believe it's the only way we can explain all this.

5798
06:11:21,520 --> 06:11:23,520
We have done this whole thing again.

5799
06:11:23,520 --> 06:11:27,279
I thought it was going to be like five people die on the boat or something.

5800
06:11:27,279 --> 06:11:29,200
Okay, we're about to do the whole thing.

5801
06:11:30,880 --> 06:11:36,880
Only one person per chapter can die because you have to code all those outcomes.

5802
06:11:38,159 --> 06:11:40,939
Yeah, but just for a second, I tried to catch up.

5803
06:11:41,099 --> 06:11:42,619
You can only die when you're allowed to die.

5804
06:11:43,659 --> 06:11:44,540
Why this?

5805
06:11:44,540 --> 06:11:45,500
This just doesn't add up.

5806
06:11:51,139 --> 06:11:52,580
Should have switched character.

5807
06:11:52,580 --> 06:11:57,540
I think there's a common misconception that if a character lives or dies,

5808
06:11:57,540 --> 06:12:00,740
that's the only indicator of a choices matter game.

5809
06:12:01,380 --> 06:12:04,340
The real thing is we're not even making choices.

5810
06:12:07,299 --> 06:12:08,099
You know what I'm saying?

5811
06:12:08,099 --> 06:12:11,619
Like we haven't chosen to do anything.

5812
06:12:13,619 --> 06:12:15,139
Okay, we're going back right now.

5813
06:12:15,139 --> 06:12:17,939
So I don't care if they haven't died by now.

5814
06:12:17,939 --> 06:12:23,939
I care because we just didn't play like we what the fuck is going on with this ship?

5815
06:12:23,939 --> 06:12:25,939
That's funny because I got to be honest.

5816
06:12:25,939 --> 06:12:30,500
It feels like there's some like like evil, like you chose not to play the game.

5817
06:12:30,500 --> 06:12:31,220
That's true.

5818
06:12:31,220 --> 06:12:33,139
Let's just stay calm and relative.

5819
06:12:33,139 --> 06:12:34,419
I'm talking about the first playthrough.

5820
06:12:34,419 --> 06:12:36,740
Okay, that's stuff I saw.

5821
06:12:37,700 --> 06:12:39,779
It's like there were these old soldiers that they were.

5822
06:12:39,779 --> 06:12:41,139
There's never like two paths.

5823
06:12:41,139 --> 06:12:42,500
Which one do you want to do?

5824
06:12:42,580 --> 06:12:46,419
That doesn't that actually they all lead to the same thing.

5825
06:12:46,419 --> 06:12:48,979
Now, it seems the only Alex.

5826
06:12:48,979 --> 06:12:49,860
What are you talking about?

5827
06:12:50,419 --> 06:12:54,979
There were things walking around with his face on them about his face.

5828
06:12:54,979 --> 06:12:57,459
He was it's horrifying faces.

5829
06:12:57,459 --> 06:12:58,740
Alex is so ugly.

5830
06:12:59,459 --> 06:13:00,659
What the fuck?

5831
06:13:01,220 --> 06:13:02,340
Why did you say that about me?

5832
06:13:03,759 --> 06:13:05,279
Sorry, I'm just parroting the last stream.

5833
06:13:05,279 --> 06:13:06,240
This is the second stream.

5834
06:13:06,959 --> 06:13:11,709
Maybe like one thing could but not all of these crazy things.

5835
06:13:12,270 --> 06:13:13,470
It's too much of a coincidence.

5836
06:13:14,110 --> 06:13:16,529
There's got to be something going on here.

5837
06:13:17,250 --> 06:13:18,939
What can we absolutely be sure about?

5838
06:13:19,819 --> 06:13:20,779
What do we know that's real?

5839
06:13:21,500 --> 06:13:29,340
We're wasting time.

5840
06:13:29,340 --> 06:13:30,860
Whatever we do, we have to do it now.

5841
06:13:31,500 --> 06:13:32,540
Time to get off this ship.

5842
06:13:33,259 --> 06:13:35,740
We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.

5843
06:13:35,740 --> 06:13:37,099
The Duke needs it to run.

5844
06:13:37,099 --> 06:13:38,299
What's the next stream tomorrow?

5845
06:13:39,580 --> 06:13:41,180
This ship's got to have a radio.

5846
06:13:45,180 --> 06:13:45,819
That's great.

5847
06:13:45,819 --> 06:13:47,099
But do you think it still works?

5848
06:13:48,060 --> 06:13:48,860
Streaming tomorrow.

5849
06:13:50,139 --> 06:13:57,220
So we have to go through this again.

5850
06:14:01,169 --> 06:14:04,209
Is there like a way I can I can I just like get off this damn ship?

5851
06:14:05,490 --> 06:14:05,970
No shit.

5852
06:14:06,770 --> 06:14:09,169
I think we're speaking clinically.

5853
06:14:09,889 --> 06:14:10,930
Speedruns going pretty good.

5854
06:14:10,930 --> 06:14:12,930
So the speedrun is going really good so far.

5855
06:14:13,889 --> 06:14:15,330
We might set a new world first.

5856
06:14:16,130 --> 06:14:24,830
Why are they doing this again?

5857
06:14:24,830 --> 06:14:25,630
I just got here.

5858
06:14:27,090 --> 06:14:27,729
You just got here.

5859
06:14:27,729 --> 06:14:28,770
How do you know we're doing it again?

5860
06:14:30,580 --> 06:14:31,080
Uh-oh.

5861
06:14:42,909 --> 06:14:43,709
Find the radio.

5862
06:14:44,349 --> 06:14:53,099
Find a way up.

5863
06:14:53,099 --> 06:14:53,659
All right.

5864
06:14:53,659 --> 06:14:54,299
It's around here.

5865
06:14:57,250 --> 06:14:58,209
Just follow me.

5866
06:14:58,209 --> 06:14:59,250
I know where it is, Zephyr.

5867
06:15:07,409 --> 06:15:09,169
I did the same thing last time.

5868
06:15:10,479 --> 06:15:11,040
What did you do?

5869
06:15:11,759 --> 06:15:12,000
Right?

5870
06:15:12,000 --> 06:15:12,720
Did I?

5871
06:15:12,720 --> 06:15:13,599
I did the same thing.

5872
06:15:14,619 --> 06:15:19,790
I leaned over on the side of the chair and that got hurt again.

5873
06:15:19,790 --> 06:15:21,630
Like I moved too far over to my right.

5874
06:15:21,630 --> 06:15:22,990
Why did I do that twice?

5875
06:15:23,869 --> 06:15:27,599
This is freaking me out.

5876
06:15:27,599 --> 06:15:28,639
This is actually getting in my head.

5877
06:15:28,639 --> 06:15:29,200
I'll pull you up.

5878
06:15:30,080 --> 06:15:34,080
Is there some gas coming in that I need to be aware of?

5879
06:15:35,680 --> 06:15:37,759
Maybe it's the amount of time that we've been in the game.

5880
06:15:37,759 --> 06:15:39,599
I leaned over on the right.

5881
06:15:39,599 --> 06:15:45,500
And if I lean too hard, my right arm rest will move.

5882
06:15:45,500 --> 06:15:47,180
And it kind of catches me sometimes.

5883
06:15:47,180 --> 06:15:49,419
And I hurt my fucking elbow.

5884
06:15:52,290 --> 06:15:53,650
Someone is teleporting.

5885
06:16:00,270 --> 06:16:01,790
Do a deep sniff.

5886
06:16:08,740 --> 06:16:12,750
This is where I chased comrades before.

5887
06:16:13,389 --> 06:16:13,709
Yeah.

5888
06:16:24,560 --> 06:16:25,279
Okay.

5889
06:16:25,279 --> 06:16:26,400
We're almost at the end of the game.

5890
06:16:29,650 --> 06:16:30,209
Over here.

5891
06:16:30,209 --> 06:16:31,009
We do the radio.

5892
06:16:32,849 --> 06:16:34,610
And then that's like the final scene.

5893
06:16:35,569 --> 06:16:37,020
Got to wait through here.

5894
06:16:40,959 --> 06:16:45,759
The way we've been playing has been making the characters glitch around my game.

5895
06:16:46,560 --> 06:16:47,869
Oh, I'm certain of it.

5896
06:16:50,659 --> 06:16:52,900
Because I'm hosting this, right?

5897
06:16:53,779 --> 06:17:00,259
So that means that I'm dumping data into your computer's brain and it can't take it.

5898
06:17:01,740 --> 06:17:03,580
Because it's just all these things are happening too quickly.

5899
06:17:07,360 --> 06:17:07,919
Loading in.

5900
06:17:08,479 --> 06:17:13,310
Okay.

5901
06:17:13,310 --> 06:17:15,630
Let's go find the radio.

5902
06:17:15,630 --> 06:17:16,669
Should I scream?

5903
06:17:16,669 --> 06:17:17,790
Should I just say nothing?

5904
06:17:20,099 --> 06:17:21,779
Say nothing to the radio.

5905
06:17:22,419 --> 06:17:23,060
Where is it?

5906
06:17:23,060 --> 06:17:23,619
It's in here, right?

5907
06:17:24,259 --> 06:17:30,959
What are you doing?

5908
06:17:30,959 --> 06:17:37,340
What's my character doing?

5909
06:17:37,340 --> 06:17:37,900
Scream?

5910
06:17:37,900 --> 06:17:42,619
No, I'm not going to say anything because that tells them that there's people here.

5911
06:17:42,619 --> 06:17:43,740
Maybe they won't show up at the end.

5912
06:17:44,459 --> 06:17:51,250
Where is this damn radio?

5913
06:17:56,639 --> 06:17:57,630
I remember that.

5914
06:17:57,630 --> 06:17:59,709
No, but there's gotta be a radio on this ship.

5915
06:17:59,709 --> 06:18:00,509
They're...

5916
06:18:00,509 --> 06:18:10,380
Okay, it's about the lore.

5917
06:18:10,380 --> 06:18:12,060
Radio is back here, right?

5918
06:18:12,060 --> 06:18:12,299
Yeah.

5919
06:18:13,259 --> 06:18:15,259
And then it's Mayday, Mayday.

5920
06:18:18,110 --> 06:18:22,270
Do you think it's easier to navigate your character in this game or Resident Evil 1

5921
06:18:22,270 --> 06:18:23,549
on original console?

5922
06:18:24,509 --> 06:18:25,229
That's Tasa.

5923
06:18:25,229 --> 06:18:26,590
No freaking way.

5924
06:18:27,150 --> 06:18:28,669
This thing actually still works?

5925
06:18:29,630 --> 06:18:36,209
Wait, I'm doing this this time?

5926
06:18:38,450 --> 06:18:39,889
Good old shortwave radio.

5927
06:18:42,720 --> 06:18:44,000
Resident Evil 1.

5928
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:45,119
It's a number station.

5929
06:18:47,580 --> 06:18:48,619
Military bandwidth.

5930
06:18:48,619 --> 06:18:51,259
Okay, let's ask something else.

5931
06:18:52,509 --> 06:18:54,349
Yeah, we don't know the name of the ship.

5932
06:18:54,349 --> 06:18:55,310
Therefore, we're not given...

5933
06:18:55,310 --> 06:18:56,110
Come in, please.

5934
06:18:56,909 --> 06:18:57,869
Do you read us?

5935
06:18:58,669 --> 06:18:58,990
Over.

5936
06:19:06,340 --> 06:19:08,580
Okay, at least there's someone listening.

5937
06:19:08,580 --> 06:19:09,619
The signal's in and out, though.

5938
06:19:21,459 --> 06:19:22,979
Listen, that was our only chance.

5939
06:19:24,500 --> 06:19:27,680
What's wrong with you?

5940
06:19:27,680 --> 06:19:34,240
Imagine being kidnapped, abducted, held hostage, torn onto a ghost boat against your will.

5941
06:19:34,880 --> 06:19:36,560
You get a working radio.

5942
06:19:36,560 --> 06:19:38,000
You say nothing.

5943
06:19:38,000 --> 06:19:40,639
No, at that point, that's when one of the characters just starts laughing.

5944
06:19:40,639 --> 06:19:42,159
This has got to lead somewhere.

5945
06:19:42,159 --> 06:19:43,439
Maybe we can find a way to get the power back.

5946
06:19:43,439 --> 06:19:44,720
I can't believe it.

5947
06:19:44,720 --> 06:19:45,759
We need to get that radio working.

5948
06:19:45,759 --> 06:19:46,720
Unbelievable.

5949
06:19:46,720 --> 06:19:48,080
I think someone should wait here in case our message comes a dream.

5950
06:19:48,080 --> 06:19:50,479
What else can go wrong today?

5951
06:19:50,479 --> 06:19:51,599
Obviously.

5952
06:19:51,599 --> 06:19:52,799
I can do this.

5953
06:19:52,799 --> 06:19:53,759
I should be the one to go.

5954
06:19:54,799 --> 06:19:56,240
No clowns in this game, either.

5955
06:19:57,360 --> 06:19:58,939
Except for all the main characters, but...

5956
06:20:00,979 --> 06:20:01,939
That's it, then.

5957
06:20:01,939 --> 06:20:02,819
I'm going.

5958
06:20:02,819 --> 06:20:03,540
I'm coming, too.

5959
06:20:03,540 --> 06:20:04,500
Actors, I like you.

5960
06:20:05,060 --> 06:20:05,860
Really? No.

5961
06:20:05,860 --> 06:20:06,900
You're not my bodyguard.

5962
06:20:06,900 --> 06:20:07,459
It's not your fault.

5963
06:20:07,459 --> 06:20:08,580
I'll take care of myself.

5964
06:20:08,580 --> 06:20:16,740
Then that's that.

5965
06:20:16,740 --> 06:20:17,540
I'm going.

5966
06:20:17,540 --> 06:20:18,700
Okay, Julia.

5967
06:20:18,700 --> 06:20:19,979
We got the same outcome.

5968
06:20:19,979 --> 06:20:20,700
Fuck.

5969
06:20:20,700 --> 06:20:22,299
We should have said, let me go.

5970
06:20:23,340 --> 06:20:25,659
We've done the same outcome.

5971
06:20:25,659 --> 06:20:26,459
The same thing.

5972
06:20:29,500 --> 06:20:31,040
The same run.

5973
06:20:31,680 --> 06:20:34,720
The only thing that's changed is you T-Posed on the ground.

5974
06:20:36,080 --> 06:20:37,840
We're doomed to repeat history.

5975
06:20:40,560 --> 06:20:50,220
Oh, we have to try to get shot by that guy, right?

5976
06:20:51,259 --> 06:20:55,389
Keep telling him that there's no mist.

5977
06:20:55,389 --> 06:20:56,430
Just be like, what are you talking about?

5978
06:20:56,830 --> 06:20:57,790
I see the mist.

5979
06:20:57,790 --> 06:20:58,430
There is no mist.

5980
06:20:59,150 --> 06:21:05,569
What are we going to do?

5981
06:21:06,849 --> 06:21:16,159
We'll wait here by the radiant.

5982
06:21:16,159 --> 06:21:16,959
He thinks we're dead.

5983
06:21:16,959 --> 06:21:18,639
We're just embarrassed, okay?

5984
06:21:18,639 --> 06:21:19,139
Gosh.

5985
06:21:20,080 --> 06:21:23,599
I can't believe we just said it with such confidence and gusto

5986
06:21:23,599 --> 06:21:25,680
that we were going to be the ones to jump down there.

5987
06:21:25,680 --> 06:21:26,639
And then we just...

5988
06:21:26,639 --> 06:21:27,520
I don't know, guys.

5989
06:21:27,520 --> 06:21:29,040
I was expecting a different outcome.

5990
06:21:30,080 --> 06:21:30,580
Hey.

5991
06:21:31,200 --> 06:21:32,080
That's so stupid.

5992
06:21:36,060 --> 06:21:36,560
Bubbles.

5993
06:21:37,259 --> 06:21:39,159
After you.

5994
06:21:40,020 --> 06:21:43,380
Okay.

5995
06:21:44,240 --> 06:21:44,740
Straight.

5996
06:21:45,680 --> 06:21:46,180
Forward.

5997
06:21:47,549 --> 06:21:48,049
Forward.

5998
06:21:48,049 --> 06:21:48,549
Left.

5999
06:21:48,990 --> 06:21:50,590
Hug the corners.

6000
06:21:50,590 --> 06:21:51,150
Save time.

6001
06:21:51,709 --> 06:21:52,209
Okay.

6002
06:21:54,930 --> 06:21:55,650
Your cameras.

6003
06:21:55,650 --> 06:21:56,369
I still see you.

6004
06:21:57,330 --> 06:21:57,830
That's me.

6005
06:21:58,689 --> 06:21:59,650
That's me.

6006
06:21:59,650 --> 06:22:01,009
I thought that I was Brad.

6007
06:22:02,459 --> 06:22:03,500
Eat the food on the cart.

6008
06:22:04,060 --> 06:22:10,959
You missed the food.

6009
06:22:10,959 --> 06:22:11,459
Go back.

6010
06:22:15,250 --> 06:22:16,130
Hey, are you Brad?

6011
06:22:16,849 --> 06:22:19,090
You missed this food that you missed on the cart.

6012
06:22:20,529 --> 06:22:21,330
Gold on table.

6013
06:22:25,040 --> 06:22:26,959
Look, it's different down there.

6014
06:22:26,959 --> 06:22:31,380
Looks like the engine room.

6015
06:22:31,380 --> 06:22:32,900
Good place to find the generator, right?

6016
06:22:39,840 --> 06:22:40,959
The ladder's broken off here.

6017
06:22:42,000 --> 06:22:43,900
I think I can just...

6018
06:22:44,540 --> 06:22:45,040
Wait.

6019
06:22:46,700 --> 06:22:47,259
Are you okay?

6020
06:22:48,720 --> 06:22:49,220
Yeah.

6021
06:22:49,220 --> 06:22:50,959
You know when you love a movie so much?

6022
06:22:50,959 --> 06:22:51,459
Okay.

6023
06:22:51,459 --> 06:22:52,319
Just come down.

6024
06:22:52,319 --> 06:22:52,959
In the theater.

6025
06:22:53,680 --> 06:22:55,680
And you're out of the seat.

6026
06:22:55,680 --> 06:22:57,200
That was so good.

6027
06:22:57,200 --> 06:22:59,520
That was the best movie I've ever seen in my life.

6028
06:22:59,520 --> 06:23:00,880
Let's go watch it again.

6029
06:23:00,880 --> 06:23:01,360
Right now.

6030
06:23:01,360 --> 06:23:02,959
Let's get in there and watch it right now.

6031
06:23:02,959 --> 06:23:04,639
You go to the next show and you move.

6032
06:23:04,639 --> 06:23:05,360
Oh, God.

6033
06:23:05,360 --> 06:23:05,840
What's up?

6034
06:23:05,840 --> 06:23:06,340
That...

6035
06:23:06,880 --> 06:23:07,520
It was...

6036
06:23:07,520 --> 06:23:08,720
Why are we doing this?

6037
06:23:08,720 --> 06:23:09,840
We didn't like this movie.

6038
06:23:09,840 --> 06:23:11,840
Are you hearing my jokes, like, on a delay?

6039
06:23:12,479 --> 06:23:12,979
What?

6040
06:23:14,000 --> 06:23:14,500
I...

6041
06:23:14,500 --> 06:23:16,639
When we first started it, I said that.

6042
06:23:18,319 --> 06:23:18,819
You did?

6043
06:23:19,360 --> 06:23:19,860
Yeah.

6044
06:23:24,029 --> 06:23:24,669
Were you muted?

6045
06:23:25,790 --> 06:23:26,290
No.

6046
06:23:27,630 --> 06:23:32,590
I said, uh, hey, projector boy fell asleep and he forgot to run the audio.

6047
06:23:32,590 --> 06:23:33,790
So we were all being silent.

6048
06:23:35,360 --> 06:23:37,040
But we're seeing the second showing in the evening.

6049
06:23:38,720 --> 06:23:39,919
When did you say it?

6050
06:23:39,919 --> 06:23:41,040
It's a theory, I guess.

6051
06:23:41,919 --> 06:23:42,419
Oh, God.

6052
06:23:43,740 --> 06:23:44,380
All right.

6053
06:23:44,380 --> 06:23:45,099
Let's get going.

6054
06:23:46,459 --> 06:23:47,419
That's not the same joke.

6055
06:23:48,720 --> 06:23:49,200
If they take...

6056
06:23:49,200 --> 06:23:50,720
They both take place in a movie theater.

6057
06:23:51,740 --> 06:23:56,459
I said it's like when a big movie opens and there's a second evening showing.

6058
06:24:00,819 --> 06:24:02,099
That's basically the same thing.

6059
06:24:06,080 --> 06:24:08,080
Except in this one, we're being silent.

6060
06:24:08,080 --> 06:24:09,439
Well, get fucking plagiarized.

6061
06:24:11,900 --> 06:24:13,740
Does that mean that I wasn't listening to you?

6062
06:24:19,919 --> 06:24:21,200
Can you walk forward?

6063
06:24:21,840 --> 06:24:26,580
I can't...

6064
06:24:26,580 --> 06:24:28,020
I don't know where I'm going.

6065
06:24:32,779 --> 06:24:34,700
Please move your character.

6066
06:24:34,700 --> 06:24:45,090
Hey, it's the rebreather.

6067
06:24:45,090 --> 06:24:48,029
The fisherman must have bothered over from the Duke of Milan.

6068
06:24:48,590 --> 06:24:50,029
You think it still works?

6069
06:24:50,029 --> 06:24:51,709
Looks like it's got a little juice left.

6070
06:24:51,709 --> 06:24:52,590
Maybe a couple of minutes.

6071
06:24:53,229 --> 06:24:54,110
Should we bring it with us?

6072
06:24:54,110 --> 06:24:54,830
I mean, it's heavy.

6073
06:25:05,099 --> 06:25:06,939
I don't even know what you decided there.

6074
06:25:08,540 --> 06:25:10,130
All right, this is important.

6075
06:25:10,130 --> 06:25:10,630
This is important.

6076
06:25:11,810 --> 06:25:12,310
Get shot.

6077
06:25:24,860 --> 06:25:34,939
It's the mist.

6078
06:25:35,919 --> 06:25:36,880
The mist is doing it.

6079
06:25:52,049 --> 06:25:55,569
Yeah, we have to tell him that we have been breathing this mist all day.

6080
06:25:57,009 --> 06:25:59,490
Just be like, oh yeah, we've been breathing it in.

6081
06:25:59,490 --> 06:26:00,450
We breathe it in every day.

6082
06:26:01,330 --> 06:26:07,790
I think we messed it up pretty bad last time.

6083
06:26:07,790 --> 06:26:09,869
I don't know how to do it any worse.

6084
06:26:10,590 --> 06:26:16,369
The way to do it is to keep saying that you breathed in the mist.

6085
06:26:18,290 --> 06:26:19,729
So like actually have to try.

6086
06:26:27,389 --> 06:26:28,669
Why would he scream at us?

6087
06:26:28,669 --> 06:26:32,930
Because keep saying that there is no mist.

6088
06:26:37,180 --> 06:26:39,580
Okay, so we have to keep telling this guy that there's no mist.

6089
06:26:39,580 --> 06:26:42,060
There's no mist hiding, you little foots.

6090
06:26:42,060 --> 06:26:47,229
And we're sharing all that gold, huh?

6091
06:26:47,229 --> 06:26:51,259
There must be plenty of that.

6092
06:26:51,259 --> 06:26:53,310
Wait, here it comes.

6093
06:27:05,500 --> 06:27:07,020
Oh no, he didn't say the line.

6094
06:27:08,779 --> 06:27:14,819
It's like Scooby Doo.

6095
06:27:22,240 --> 06:27:27,090
Okay, quick thinking.

6096
06:27:27,090 --> 06:27:28,130
Please tell me we're safe.

6097
06:27:29,409 --> 06:27:30,799
Yeah, totally.

6098
06:27:31,439 --> 06:27:36,290
I mean, these doors are vented with stand also stuff.

6099
06:27:39,200 --> 06:27:49,419
Okay, so we have to say the mist is fake.

6100
06:27:50,860 --> 06:27:51,580
You're stupid.

6101
06:27:51,580 --> 06:27:52,619
The mist is not real.

6102
06:27:53,900 --> 06:27:56,979
There's no mist.

6103
06:28:00,000 --> 06:28:05,580
Okay, say you breathe it in and then say it's not real.

6104
06:28:07,950 --> 06:28:08,750
Raise your hands up.

6105
06:28:16,180 --> 06:28:16,979
No changing.

6106
06:28:23,299 --> 06:28:25,060
Just put the gun down.

6107
06:28:25,950 --> 06:28:27,389
Nobody has to get hurt.

6108
06:28:27,389 --> 06:28:29,950
I bet being completely silent here is the optimal.

6109
06:28:33,229 --> 06:28:36,270
We have to tell them that there's no such thing as a mist.

6110
06:28:37,389 --> 06:28:38,509
I picked the worst option.

6111
06:28:44,430 --> 06:28:46,029
There's the Aria monsters thing.

6112
06:28:53,009 --> 06:28:54,209
What did you just say?

6113
06:28:56,450 --> 06:29:00,529
What mist?

6114
06:29:01,330 --> 06:29:05,569
What's going on?

6115
06:29:05,569 --> 06:29:06,049
Is this me?

6116
06:29:08,209 --> 06:29:08,689
That was you.

6117
06:29:08,689 --> 06:29:10,209
Yeah, I couldn't control it.

6118
06:29:32,049 --> 06:29:33,330
Which one do I do?

6119
06:29:33,330 --> 06:29:35,090
I think we're supposed to say that it's not real.

6120
06:29:35,090 --> 06:29:36,529
Like he's like crazy or something.

6121
06:29:37,860 --> 06:29:38,659
There's no mist.

6122
06:29:55,299 --> 06:29:56,340
There's no mist.

6123
06:29:56,340 --> 06:29:57,299
What are you talking about?

6124
06:30:04,830 --> 06:30:05,389
There it is.

6125
06:30:14,669 --> 06:30:16,029
Why would he shoot her?

6126
06:30:18,189 --> 06:30:20,750
And not the guy who's like there's no mist, dude.

6127
06:30:21,869 --> 06:30:24,909
Hey, dude, what are you talking about?

6128
06:30:24,909 --> 06:30:28,669
I am effectively telling you, me, that you're wrong.

6129
06:30:28,669 --> 06:30:30,509
I'm gonna shoot the person fucking next to you.

6130
06:30:30,509 --> 06:30:33,310
Like unabashedly out of your mind.

6131
06:30:33,310 --> 06:30:34,909
I'm basically calling you crazy.

6132
06:30:34,909 --> 06:30:36,990
I am essentially saying, hey, shoot me, please.

6133
06:30:36,990 --> 06:30:38,110
I would like you to do it.

6134
06:30:39,229 --> 06:30:39,950
That girl.

6135
06:30:40,509 --> 06:30:45,549
Don't worry, just raise her head.

6136
06:30:47,069 --> 06:30:49,389
She comes back the next scene with like a bandage around her head.

6137
06:30:57,040 --> 06:30:58,720
He was just trying to scare her.

6138
06:31:05,439 --> 06:31:08,080
Okay, so here's the opportunity for us to screw this up somehow.

6139
06:31:10,659 --> 06:31:11,939
Well, we already know what happens here.

6140
06:31:21,599 --> 06:31:22,099
Do we?

6141
06:31:26,400 --> 06:31:30,380
Better choreography than Game of Thrones.

6142
06:31:56,029 --> 06:31:56,830
Who was that?

6143
06:32:07,569 --> 06:32:14,139
Over here.

6144
06:32:14,139 --> 06:32:15,500
This must have been what we just heard.

6145
06:32:16,619 --> 06:32:26,450
Doesn't matter.

6146
06:32:26,450 --> 06:32:27,810
We need that distributor cap.

6147
06:32:29,009 --> 06:32:30,770
So this time I'm gonna kill you.

6148
06:32:32,290 --> 06:32:46,740
Brad is invincible.

6149
06:32:47,380 --> 06:32:48,259
Brad is invincible.

6150
06:32:50,419 --> 06:32:51,540
Brad is invincible?

6151
06:32:52,419 --> 06:32:52,740
I mean.

6152
06:32:53,619 --> 06:32:54,740
Are you Brad?

6153
06:32:54,740 --> 06:32:55,240
No.

6154
06:33:06,270 --> 06:33:07,069
All right.

6155
06:33:07,069 --> 06:33:11,950
Is this like a bad guy in the game or is this like a Diablo 3 loot goblin?

6156
06:33:14,400 --> 06:33:16,479
He's he's just like, oh, I fuck.

6157
06:33:17,040 --> 06:33:17,759
Oh, no.

6158
06:33:17,759 --> 06:33:20,159
I pressed the button supposed to be running away from him.

6159
06:33:20,159 --> 06:33:21,680
It feels like we're chasing him.

6160
06:33:22,880 --> 06:33:26,400
My brain turned off and I just like did the QTE.

6161
06:33:27,360 --> 06:33:31,759
Well, you did the QTE.

6162
06:33:31,759 --> 06:33:33,520
I did the I did the first QTE.

6163
06:33:38,619 --> 06:33:39,580
I don't think it matters though.

6164
06:33:45,840 --> 06:33:46,639
No, it doesn't matter.

6165
06:33:59,340 --> 06:33:59,979
I'll follow him.

6166
06:33:59,979 --> 06:34:02,939
I'll just find the little gold coins that are in a trail.

6167
06:34:03,900 --> 06:34:07,819
Does anything matter when we saw that everyone gets gunned down at the end?

6168
06:34:07,819 --> 06:34:09,020
Unless you fix the boat.

6169
06:34:09,819 --> 06:34:10,750
That is true.

6170
06:34:13,889 --> 06:34:16,130
There's one choice that really matters.

6171
06:34:17,169 --> 06:34:21,569
And it's up to you to save the piece of equipment.

6172
06:34:21,569 --> 06:34:23,729
I'm not gonna make this jump, Alex.

6173
06:34:23,729 --> 06:34:25,250
I'll have to find another way around.

6174
06:34:25,250 --> 06:34:26,529
And then I'm gonna stab you.

6175
06:34:27,169 --> 06:34:35,069
But then how do you die?

6176
06:34:35,069 --> 06:34:36,509
Because you killed yourself last time.

6177
06:34:39,040 --> 06:34:40,159
Uh, that's it.

6178
06:34:40,159 --> 06:34:40,959
I don't know.

6179
06:34:40,959 --> 06:34:42,639
Then I would just I just get gunned down.

6180
06:34:46,020 --> 06:34:47,700
My control is like fucking broken.

6181
06:34:48,340 --> 06:34:52,779
What the hell is going on with this thing?

6182
06:34:52,779 --> 06:34:59,040
I've seen this one before.

6183
06:34:59,759 --> 06:35:01,869
I have an actual headache.

6184
06:35:03,900 --> 06:35:04,779
Like in real life?

6185
06:35:05,340 --> 06:35:07,900
Yeah, from this video game.

6186
06:35:08,700 --> 06:35:12,259
Oh shit.

6187
06:35:12,979 --> 06:35:16,029
I think I think the miss is seeping through.

6188
06:35:16,029 --> 06:35:18,959
Well, we're almost done.

6189
06:35:19,979 --> 06:35:21,500
We're almost done completely.

6190
06:35:22,060 --> 06:35:24,900
So, um, who's left to kill?

6191
06:35:26,020 --> 06:35:28,639
Wait, can I just get eaten by rats?

6192
06:35:29,439 --> 06:35:30,240
Fuck.

6193
06:35:30,319 --> 06:35:33,680
So do we want the everyone dies to gunfire at the end or no?

6194
06:35:34,400 --> 06:35:37,310
Well, it's only gonna be like two or three.

6195
06:35:37,869 --> 06:35:40,270
But you're like, yes or no, because I have to choose now.

6196
06:35:40,270 --> 06:35:42,270
Uh, may as well just get us all killed.

6197
06:35:43,069 --> 06:35:49,580
Because didn't we already go back and do this the right way?

6198
06:35:49,580 --> 06:35:50,080
We did.

6199
06:35:52,369 --> 06:35:56,220
We've seen both of those endings already.

6200
06:35:56,220 --> 06:35:59,889
However, really a choice that I made right there.

6201
06:36:03,759 --> 06:36:04,479
Oh, no.

6202
06:36:06,259 --> 06:36:09,139
Like, did I make a choice or did I just try to open a door?

6203
06:36:12,020 --> 06:36:12,520
Okay.

6204
06:36:20,369 --> 06:36:29,060
I'm gonna try to be as menacing as possible.

6205
06:36:29,060 --> 06:36:30,180
Wait, why are you different?

6206
06:36:33,330 --> 06:36:33,970
Am I different?

6207
06:36:33,970 --> 06:36:35,169
You're a different monster.

6208
06:36:36,130 --> 06:36:39,169
Alex, it's me.

6209
06:36:39,169 --> 06:36:39,669
What?

6210
06:36:43,409 --> 06:36:44,689
It's a different person.

6211
06:36:45,330 --> 06:36:55,900
Put the knife down.

6212
06:36:55,900 --> 06:36:56,400
What?

6213
06:36:56,860 --> 06:37:00,770
So what was the...

6214
06:37:00,770 --> 06:37:03,169
I gotta watch to see what monster I was.

6215
06:37:03,169 --> 06:37:06,049
You were like a two-headed, a great show.

6216
06:37:08,740 --> 06:37:09,939
Now you're just the...

6217
06:37:09,939 --> 06:37:10,979
Give me the knife, okay?

6218
06:37:10,979 --> 06:37:11,779
The captain guy.

6219
06:37:11,779 --> 06:37:13,060
Give me the knife.

6220
06:37:13,060 --> 06:37:13,560
Olsen.

6221
06:37:32,479 --> 06:37:34,000
All right, now what happens if I stop?

6222
06:37:34,000 --> 06:37:35,040
What happens if I stop now?

6223
06:37:35,759 --> 06:37:36,479
You're still going.

6224
06:37:37,279 --> 06:37:40,159
But if I stop...

6225
06:37:47,979 --> 06:37:50,220
You went right for center mass with at least one of those.

6226
06:37:50,220 --> 06:37:50,720
I did?

6227
06:37:51,500 --> 06:37:52,000
Yeah.

6228
06:38:04,700 --> 06:38:05,659
Oh, right.

6229
06:38:05,659 --> 06:38:10,189
The reason you didn't see the two-headed monster is because, uh...

6230
06:38:12,419 --> 06:38:19,139
When I was playing as Alex, we had found the two-headed monster in one of the coffins.

6231
06:38:19,139 --> 06:38:20,740
So it was in his imagination.

6232
06:38:20,740 --> 06:38:21,540
That's right.

6233
06:38:21,540 --> 06:38:22,040
Oh.

6234
06:38:23,279 --> 06:38:24,400
This time we speed ran.

6235
06:38:25,200 --> 06:38:45,549
All right.

6236
06:38:45,549 --> 06:38:47,020
We did it.

6237
06:38:47,020 --> 06:38:47,900
We did it as...

6238
06:38:49,340 --> 06:38:51,180
We've played through the game twice.

6239
06:38:51,180 --> 06:38:52,860
We've played through the whole game two times.

6240
06:38:53,500 --> 06:38:57,729
I mean, played is very loosely stated.

6241
06:38:58,689 --> 06:38:59,889
So now what happens if...

6242
06:38:59,889 --> 06:39:01,970
Because we didn't tell anybody on the radio where we were.

6243
06:39:06,380 --> 06:39:06,880
We did.

6244
06:39:07,580 --> 06:39:09,419
Yeah, we just locked up.

6245
06:39:10,220 --> 06:39:15,500
So if nobody knows where we are on the radio, then we just live here now.

6246
06:39:17,840 --> 06:39:19,520
Brothers till the end.

6247
06:39:20,159 --> 06:39:46,930
Guess we're not going anywhere on the duke.

6248
06:39:47,889 --> 06:39:49,330
Pretty much stuck here.

6249
06:39:49,889 --> 06:39:52,139
What a way to go.

6250
06:39:58,459 --> 06:39:59,659
Starving to death.

6251
06:39:59,659 --> 06:40:02,299
Wait, what do you mean, what a way to go?

6252
06:40:02,299 --> 06:40:02,860
And that's it?

6253
06:40:04,060 --> 06:40:06,380
There's no food.

6254
06:40:06,380 --> 06:40:07,259
There's just people.

6255
06:40:07,259 --> 06:40:08,619
They could resort to cannibalism.

6256
06:40:09,659 --> 06:40:12,540
By a little time.

6257
06:40:12,540 --> 06:40:16,540
Maybe some old crates got some potatoes in cans or something.

6258
06:40:16,540 --> 06:40:17,040
I don't know.

6259
06:40:19,090 --> 06:40:19,590
Yeah, I mean...

6260
06:40:19,590 --> 06:40:22,819
I think, uh, I think I'm gonna go back in.

6261
06:40:26,590 --> 06:40:27,090
No way.

6262
06:40:27,090 --> 06:40:30,930
Hey, there's gotta be some food somewhere in there, right?

6263
06:40:31,650 --> 06:40:36,200
Ashes, cans, whatever's in there.

6264
06:40:37,319 --> 06:40:38,439
It's not worth getting.

6265
06:40:39,000 --> 06:40:40,119
We're gonna starve out here.

6266
06:40:41,319 --> 06:40:44,549
I'm gonna try to get the Duke of Milan out to sea.

6267
06:40:44,549 --> 06:40:45,110
Make a boat.

6268
06:40:45,990 --> 06:40:46,709
Take those crates.

6269
06:40:47,430 --> 06:40:49,860
How are you gonna do that with no engine?

6270
06:40:51,189 --> 06:40:53,909
Yeah, well, nowhere is better than this fucking ship.

6271
06:40:54,630 --> 06:40:57,750
That's it, Ben.

6272
06:41:01,560 --> 06:41:03,159
Are we saying goodbye to each other?

6273
06:41:04,720 --> 06:41:05,840
Why aren't we doing this together?

6274
06:41:06,880 --> 06:41:07,919
Um, I don't know.

6275
06:41:07,919 --> 06:41:11,119
It's odd to me that these two brothers just escaped

6276
06:41:11,119 --> 06:41:14,639
their own version of hell and are instantly separating.

6277
06:41:15,200 --> 06:41:16,319
I'm coming back for you.

6278
06:41:16,319 --> 06:41:17,520
Why are you not going?

6279
06:41:17,520 --> 06:41:18,080
What are you doing?

6280
06:41:18,959 --> 06:41:22,869
He's just gonna live on the ship and eat, I guess.

6281
06:41:23,909 --> 06:41:29,240
For you to do that, you'd have to assume the other person's absolutely dead,

6282
06:41:29,240 --> 06:41:30,520
but you fist bumped at the end.

6283
06:41:30,520 --> 06:41:32,360
So you just don't care that they're gonna die?

6284
06:41:40,740 --> 06:41:46,599
To go back in here for any reason.

6285
06:41:46,599 --> 06:41:53,139
I don't know.

6286
06:41:53,139 --> 06:41:55,540
Okay, there's only one other person here that can kill him.

6287
06:42:00,240 --> 06:42:05,889
Wait, we didn't have any food on the boat?

6288
06:42:06,450 --> 06:42:09,330
Imagine if two people were rowing this massive boat.

6289
06:42:09,970 --> 06:42:12,439
There's a whole downstairs kitchen.

6290
06:42:19,349 --> 06:42:20,310
It's Gendry.

6291
06:42:32,389 --> 06:42:36,549
He's just running around in a circle in like the crazy drug ship.

6292
06:42:36,549 --> 06:42:39,349
All right, now for the post credit where the dude wakes up

6293
06:42:39,349 --> 06:42:42,790
and I guess presumably kills Alex because the helicopter shouldn't be coming.

6294
06:42:46,479 --> 06:42:49,119
Yeah, there's gonna be a Danny versus Alex.

6295
06:42:49,119 --> 06:42:51,520
At least there was actually a different ending.

6296
06:42:51,520 --> 06:42:53,200
Drugged out fight, yeah.

6297
06:42:53,200 --> 06:42:54,880
Which makes it better than Blair Witch.

6298
06:43:02,150 --> 06:43:06,180
Which also says choices matter at the beginning of the game.

6299
06:43:07,060 --> 06:43:07,939
That's it.

6300
06:43:07,939 --> 06:43:08,979
Game over.

6301
06:43:08,979 --> 06:43:09,540
You're done.

6302
06:43:10,259 --> 06:43:11,139
For now, at least.

6303
06:43:11,860 --> 06:43:13,380
You could always try again.

6304
06:43:13,380 --> 06:43:15,939
See if you can't do better next time around.

6305
06:43:18,209 --> 06:43:19,569
Not a very happy ending.

6306
06:43:20,740 --> 06:43:21,619
Or maybe it is.

6307
06:43:22,580 --> 06:43:23,139
Better.

6308
06:43:23,139 --> 06:43:25,540
What makes you happy, really?

6309
06:43:25,540 --> 06:43:26,259
He knows.

6310
06:43:26,259 --> 06:43:27,220
He's watching the stream.

6311
06:43:27,220 --> 06:43:28,659
And the distributor cap.

6312
06:43:30,020 --> 06:43:32,319
Boom.

6313
06:43:32,319 --> 06:43:33,279
Unfortunate.

6314
06:43:36,130 --> 06:43:38,689
It's all about decisions, isn't it?

6315
06:43:38,689 --> 06:43:43,569
Decisions made in a hurry, in a panic, made with the heart instead of the head.

6316
06:43:44,130 --> 06:43:45,330
Or vice versa.

6317
06:43:46,290 --> 06:43:50,770
Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.

6318
06:43:51,889 --> 06:43:54,049
But there are repercussions.

6319
06:43:54,049 --> 06:43:55,889
But what were the long-term repercussions?

6320
06:43:56,849 --> 06:43:57,650
There wasn't a scenario.

6321
06:43:57,650 --> 06:44:02,130
Is he suggesting that in a future anthology game, those choices are going to matter?

6322
06:44:02,130 --> 06:44:04,209
If they're separate games, I don't see how that's possible.

6323
06:44:05,250 --> 06:44:10,209
But like, we just overwrote everything that we did.

6324
06:44:10,209 --> 06:44:11,169
Until we meet again.

6325
06:44:11,169 --> 06:44:12,689
Maybe in Little Hope.

6326
06:44:12,689 --> 06:44:14,130
Maybe somewhere else.

6327
06:44:15,409 --> 06:44:16,869
But be certain.

6328
06:44:17,669 --> 06:44:18,790
We will meet again.

6329
06:44:19,590 --> 06:44:20,799
But I can't speak.

6330
06:44:20,799 --> 06:44:21,840
Yeah, it's not an anthology.

6331
06:44:22,959 --> 06:44:29,509
Cool.

6332
06:44:29,509 --> 06:44:30,549
All right, you ready to see the...

6333
06:44:30,790 --> 06:44:40,470
McDonald's menu item tier list.

6334
06:44:40,470 --> 06:44:40,790
Now.

6335
06:44:45,889 --> 06:44:47,330
You guys fucking crack me up.

6336
06:44:53,669 --> 06:44:54,389
New content.

6337
06:45:02,740 --> 06:45:04,020
He's chafing a little, I think.

6338
06:45:04,819 --> 06:45:07,459
Why would he be sitting above deck this entire time?

6339
06:45:07,459 --> 06:45:08,099
Is the real question.

6340
06:45:16,610 --> 06:45:18,209
No ship radio.

6341
06:45:25,360 --> 06:45:26,720
You could fish, though.

6342
06:45:28,040 --> 06:45:29,240
And stay alive.

6343
06:45:29,799 --> 06:45:31,319
Well, don't they have a grill?

6344
06:45:31,319 --> 06:45:34,439
They have a radio on the boat with a GPS.

6345
06:45:35,319 --> 06:45:36,200
It just can't move.

6346
06:45:37,560 --> 06:45:39,880
And he's got beds under the deck.

6347
06:45:40,919 --> 06:45:41,880
And a kitchen.

6348
06:45:42,599 --> 06:45:43,400
They've got a George Foreman grill.

6349
06:45:43,400 --> 06:45:44,200
The radio antenna broke.

6350
06:45:44,840 --> 06:45:48,680
Fishing isn't that easy.

6351
06:46:00,560 --> 06:46:00,959
Well, too.

6352
06:46:00,959 --> 06:46:01,200
Okay.

6353
06:46:02,159 --> 06:46:11,729
Uh-oh.

6354
06:46:11,729 --> 06:46:12,770
It's Dan.

6355
06:46:12,770 --> 06:46:14,369
Oh, you motherfuckers.

6356
06:46:16,130 --> 06:46:21,189
That happened to you before it happened to me, apparently.

6357
06:46:22,150 --> 06:46:24,869
Wait, I got jumpscared first?

6358
06:46:24,869 --> 06:46:26,630
Yeah, like a second before.

6359
06:46:26,630 --> 06:46:27,669
I just saw someone in the woods.

6360
06:46:28,720 --> 06:46:30,000
So I like anticipated it.

6361
06:46:33,000 --> 06:46:37,400
Man, the whole stream watched this trailer for the next one three times.

6362
06:46:37,400 --> 06:46:38,439
It wasn't even a Twitch bounty.

6363
06:46:46,130 --> 06:46:48,439
Claim the Twitch bounty.

6364
06:47:03,080 --> 06:47:03,639
We did it.

6365
06:47:06,520 --> 06:47:07,080
Yeah.

6366
06:47:07,080 --> 06:47:10,200
We stretched a three hour game into however long that ended.

6367
06:47:10,200 --> 06:47:10,840
Seven hours.

6368
06:47:13,159 --> 06:47:14,340
All right.

6369
06:47:14,340 --> 06:47:15,779
Let's give another review.

6370
06:47:15,779 --> 06:47:17,380
Time for review two.

6371
06:47:17,380 --> 06:47:17,700
Okay.

6372
06:47:17,700 --> 06:47:24,450
So I have to go through twice and trying to do absolutely like just a dog shit run.

6373
06:47:24,450 --> 06:47:26,529
Just a dog shit run.

6374
06:47:26,529 --> 06:47:30,290
Can you do me a favor, though, and watch the clip of Conrad falling?

6375
06:47:30,290 --> 06:47:31,330
I do want to watch that.

6376
06:47:35,040 --> 06:47:38,799
Does anybody have that little clip of Conrad falling?

6377
06:47:38,799 --> 06:47:39,520
I got it, yeah.

6378
06:47:39,520 --> 06:47:41,520
You've already got it.

6379
06:47:41,520 --> 06:47:41,840
Wow.

6380
06:47:41,840 --> 06:47:42,560
It's impressive.

6381
06:47:42,560 --> 06:47:43,200
I don't even have it.

6382
06:47:43,200 --> 06:47:44,159
In the door of me.

6383
06:47:45,360 --> 06:47:46,000
Let's watch it.

6384
06:47:46,000 --> 06:47:47,040
We're going to watch it on stream.

6385
06:47:48,159 --> 06:47:54,099
So this is the Conrad falling experience.

6386
06:47:55,409 --> 06:47:55,650
All right.

6387
06:47:55,650 --> 06:47:55,889
Hang on.

6388
06:47:55,889 --> 06:47:56,849
Give me a count in the door.

6389
06:47:59,569 --> 06:48:02,229
Okay.

6390
06:48:02,229 --> 06:48:03,029
Let me get it up here.

6391
06:48:03,830 --> 06:48:09,909
So this is from Alex's perspective.

6392
06:48:09,909 --> 06:48:10,470
This is him.

6393
06:48:11,840 --> 06:48:15,250
I'm going to start playing it and let's check it out.

6394
06:48:16,849 --> 06:48:18,130
Did you do the countdown?

6395
06:48:18,130 --> 06:48:20,689
Then three, two, one.

6396
06:48:20,689 --> 06:48:21,330
In the door.

6397
06:48:22,049 --> 06:48:26,229
Well, then what?

6398
06:48:26,229 --> 06:48:26,950
Stop the door.

6399
06:48:28,099 --> 06:48:28,979
You closed it.

6400
06:48:29,619 --> 06:48:30,900
Yeah, but your hand was in it.

6401
06:48:30,900 --> 06:48:31,939
Somebody's hand was in it.

6402
06:48:32,979 --> 06:48:35,729
My God.

6403
06:48:37,700 --> 06:48:47,080
The game is having trouble with trying to figure out.

6404
06:48:55,200 --> 06:48:56,319
Did you just teleport?

6405
06:48:56,319 --> 06:48:58,159
I just saw what is happening.

6406
06:48:58,959 --> 06:49:00,720
Hey, he's done it.

6407
06:49:00,720 --> 06:49:04,560
Ladies and gentlemen, all it took was seven failed cuties in a row.

6408
06:49:04,560 --> 06:49:12,180
Oh, the good classic German laughing.

6409
06:49:13,939 --> 06:49:14,659
Right at the end.

6410
06:49:15,220 --> 06:49:18,500
Oh, because I walked over and it was just the camera panned down.

6411
06:49:18,500 --> 06:49:20,340
Yeah, it was like super delayed lap.

6412
06:49:20,340 --> 06:49:21,860
I had no idea what you were seeing.

6413
06:49:21,860 --> 06:49:23,299
Yeah, because I didn't see any of that shit.

6414
06:49:24,259 --> 06:49:28,819
I walked over and the camera panned down the hole and you were just lying on your back.

6415
06:49:29,380 --> 06:49:32,630
So imagine like Conrad.

6416
06:49:32,630 --> 06:49:32,790
Okay.

6417
06:49:32,790 --> 06:49:34,310
So you did see his body though.

6418
06:49:34,310 --> 06:49:34,549
Yeah.

6419
06:49:34,549 --> 06:49:35,349
Oh, yeah.

6420
06:49:35,349 --> 06:49:35,590
Okay.

6421
06:49:36,150 --> 06:49:37,590
So it wasn't a secret that he died.

6422
06:49:40,340 --> 06:49:44,720
This game is fucking ridiculous.

6423
06:49:47,080 --> 06:49:48,520
Yeah, this was the movies.

6424
06:49:50,869 --> 06:50:00,180
I think it was like a fun co-op experiment that kind of lost sight of the foundation.

6425
06:50:00,819 --> 06:50:01,220
Yes.

6426
06:50:01,220 --> 06:50:02,580
The core principles.

6427
06:50:02,580 --> 06:50:03,700
One hundred percent.

6428
06:50:08,959 --> 06:50:10,639
It was like an interesting idea.

6429
06:50:11,970 --> 06:50:20,950
I wish there were more co-op games, but you got to have some core tenets of gameplay

6430
06:50:23,060 --> 06:50:23,779
that were missing.

6431
06:50:25,380 --> 06:50:28,020
Well, so hot.

6432
06:50:28,020 --> 06:50:28,979
You want to do the next one?

6433
06:50:30,400 --> 06:50:32,799
I'm going to do round three.

6434
06:50:32,799 --> 06:50:35,040
No, I mean the next game.

6435
06:50:35,919 --> 06:50:38,880
Oh, are we going to play the Blair Witch project one?

6436
06:50:38,880 --> 06:50:40,720
I guess we have to at this point.

6437
06:50:40,720 --> 06:50:41,279
Kind of have to.

6438
06:50:45,569 --> 06:50:45,889
All right.

6439
06:50:45,889 --> 06:50:49,810
Well, that's a clean seven hours.

6440
06:50:51,110 --> 06:50:51,750
Wasn't clean.

6441
06:50:52,950 --> 06:50:55,750
Streams went down at least ten times.

6442
06:50:55,750 --> 06:50:58,229
It was an incredibly filthy, dirty stream.

6443
06:51:01,139 --> 06:51:09,380
It was filthy, but yeah, that was Man of Medan.

6444
06:51:10,099 --> 06:51:11,799
It was a game.

6445
06:51:11,799 --> 06:51:14,979
Yeah, that was Man of Medan.

6446
06:51:17,139 --> 06:51:20,020
We kind of knew what we were getting into, but yeah.

6447
06:51:20,020 --> 06:51:22,340
Just be glad you didn't do Blair Witch.

6448
06:51:25,970 --> 06:51:33,669
I heard it was not very good, but I will see you guys tomorrow.

6449
06:51:33,669 --> 06:51:34,630
I'm streaming tomorrow.

6450
06:51:35,430 --> 06:51:36,310
That was Italics.

6451
06:51:37,029 --> 06:51:39,430
Again, everybody say hello to Italics.

6452
06:51:40,150 --> 06:51:41,189
Go follow that stream.

6453
06:51:41,830 --> 06:51:43,270
He streams too.

6454
06:51:43,270 --> 06:51:44,709
You know, he's a fucking streamer.

6455
06:51:45,750 --> 06:51:46,709
Person that's in the call.

6456
06:51:47,750 --> 06:51:48,310
Italics.

6457
06:51:49,830 --> 06:51:51,349
That is how you actually pronounce your name.

6458
06:51:55,490 --> 06:51:56,930
Who is the Man of Medan?

6459
06:51:56,930 --> 06:51:57,889
I don't know.

6460
06:51:57,889 --> 06:51:59,330
I think that's the name of the big boat.

6461
06:52:00,130 --> 06:52:01,860
Isn't it?

6462
06:52:01,860 --> 06:52:03,299
That was like the gigantic boat.

6463
06:52:03,939 --> 06:52:06,450
At least that's what I thought it was.

6464
06:52:07,970 --> 06:52:09,970
Is the boat name Man of Medan?

6465
06:52:09,970 --> 06:52:10,130
Yeah.

6466
06:52:10,849 --> 06:52:17,750
I mean, no, I don't think it is.

6467
06:52:17,750 --> 06:52:18,950
It was the Duke of Medan.

6468
06:52:20,040 --> 06:52:23,159
Yeah, it was the Duke of Milan.

6469
06:52:26,279 --> 06:52:26,840
The Man of...

6470
06:52:28,500 --> 06:52:29,139
Whatever it was.

6471
06:52:29,860 --> 06:52:33,919
That was the small boat.

6472
06:52:33,919 --> 06:52:34,639
Man Milan.

6473
06:52:36,819 --> 06:52:37,060
All right.

6474
06:52:37,060 --> 06:52:37,860
Well, I'm going to get out of here.

6475
06:52:37,860 --> 06:52:38,900
I don't know what to do.

6476
06:52:38,900 --> 06:52:40,099
I'm going to wind down.

6477
06:52:40,099 --> 06:52:40,659
I'll...

6478
06:52:40,659 --> 06:52:40,900
Yep.

6479
06:52:42,500 --> 06:52:45,240
Hey, want to go to McDonald's?

6480
06:52:47,299 --> 06:52:47,860
Uh, no.

6481
06:52:49,240 --> 06:52:50,919
I ate McDonald's yesterday.

6482
06:52:50,919 --> 06:52:51,159
Fuck.

6483
06:52:51,720 --> 06:53:00,930
Anyways, that's the end.

6484
06:53:01,830 --> 06:53:02,790
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

6485
06:53:03,349 --> 06:53:05,270
Tomorrow is...

6486
06:53:05,270 --> 06:53:07,750
Let me just double check to make sure I got everything correct here.

6487
06:53:07,750 --> 06:53:19,779
Tomorrow, we are going to do Terraria.

6488
06:53:21,380 --> 06:53:23,060
I think we actually...

6489
06:53:23,060 --> 06:53:25,060
Both of us are like on the same page.

6490
06:53:27,360 --> 06:53:30,799
So, unless something else happens, which I don't think it will.

6491
06:53:30,799 --> 06:53:33,169
We're going to finish Terraria tomorrow.

6492
06:53:33,169 --> 06:53:40,419
Those streams are cursed, though, because something seems to go wrong every time.

6493
06:53:40,419 --> 06:53:46,040
But we are finally going to close the book on Terraria tomorrow.

6494
06:53:46,040 --> 06:53:48,209
It's going to be a chill stream.

6495
06:53:48,930 --> 06:53:51,700
Thanks for joining me.

6496
06:53:52,340 --> 06:53:56,049
We're going to go out here.

6497
06:53:58,400 --> 06:53:58,959
Do the bits.

6498
06:53:59,680 --> 06:54:01,759
Say hello to the subs.

6499
06:54:04,560 --> 06:54:05,360
Plan B?

6500
06:54:05,360 --> 06:54:07,040
I do have an extreme Plan B.

6501
06:54:07,680 --> 06:54:09,200
But I don't think we're going to need it.

6502
06:54:09,200 --> 06:54:14,040
Because we did confirm that it was going to happen tomorrow.

6503
06:54:14,040 --> 06:54:16,259
So, don't worry.

6504
06:54:17,439 --> 06:54:20,080
All right, now I need to get out of here.

6505
06:54:24,209 --> 06:54:25,250
And let's say good night.

6506
06:54:25,970 --> 06:54:28,770
Thanks for joining us on Man of a Dan.

6507
06:54:28,770 --> 06:54:29,409
It was...

6508
06:54:29,409 --> 06:54:30,610
I don't think the game was...

6509
06:54:30,610 --> 06:54:32,290
Look, the game was not that good.

6510
06:54:33,250 --> 06:54:35,169
But the experience was fun.

6511
06:54:35,169 --> 06:54:37,729
Because, obviously, we were just dicking around and having a good time.

6512
06:54:38,209 --> 06:54:41,650
Playing this with one or two, maybe three or potential four people on a couch.

6513
06:54:42,610 --> 06:54:43,810
There is some value there.

6514
06:54:43,810 --> 06:54:44,310
There is.

6515
06:54:47,490 --> 06:54:48,049
I had a blast.

6516
06:54:48,049 --> 06:54:48,770
I hope you did, too.

6517
06:54:49,409 --> 06:54:52,950
And if we don't see you tomorrow, maybe we'll see you next time.

6518
06:54:53,590 --> 06:54:57,110
So let's rewind a little bit here.

6519
06:54:57,110 --> 06:55:00,069
Let's go back to earlier.

6520
06:55:00,069 --> 06:55:01,270
Lazy Luke had $3.

6521
06:55:01,270 --> 06:55:02,709
They just said Subway 300.

6522
06:55:03,270 --> 06:55:04,549
Thanks to three bucks, Lazy Luke.

6523
06:55:05,110 --> 06:55:07,080
Appreciate it.

6524
06:55:07,959 --> 06:55:08,360
Thank you.

6525
06:55:10,659 --> 06:55:12,180
Thank you, Wiki.

6526
06:55:12,180 --> 06:55:13,139
This for the three bucks.

6527
06:55:13,139 --> 06:55:16,099
This is truly the Citizen Kane of video game stories.

6528
06:55:18,979 --> 06:55:20,099
I mean, it was cool.

6529
06:55:20,659 --> 06:55:21,779
It's an interesting...

6530
06:55:21,779 --> 06:55:22,500
Look, Super...

6531
06:55:23,060 --> 06:55:25,060
Go back to Until Dawn.

6532
06:55:26,369 --> 06:55:30,049
They did a similar kind of game last time.

6533
06:55:30,930 --> 06:55:36,049
I almost feel like they tried to do too much of close to what they did before.

6534
06:55:36,689 --> 06:55:40,549
They're almost like, this game felt like it was...

6535
06:55:40,549 --> 06:55:41,750
Hey, remember Until Dawn?

6536
06:55:43,669 --> 06:55:44,470
There's monsters.

6537
06:55:44,470 --> 06:55:45,590
And there might be other people.

6538
06:55:45,590 --> 06:55:46,150
And there might be...

6539
06:55:47,840 --> 06:55:48,720
There could be other...

6540
06:55:49,919 --> 06:55:50,959
Is it a monster or a person?

6541
06:55:50,959 --> 06:55:51,759
Or is it a...

6542
06:55:51,759 --> 06:55:52,319
Is it a monster?

6543
06:55:52,319 --> 06:55:52,959
It is a monster.

6544
06:55:55,990 --> 06:55:58,069
This actually seemed like it was...

6545
06:55:58,069 --> 06:55:59,990
They rewrote Until Dawn.

6546
06:56:03,380 --> 06:56:04,900
And it just wasn't as good.

6547
06:56:04,900 --> 06:56:06,020
And it was way shorter.

6548
06:56:13,680 --> 06:56:16,560
But the good thing is they made Until Dawn.

6549
06:56:18,319 --> 06:56:19,119
And that game...

6550
06:56:19,119 --> 06:56:20,159
I loved that game.

6551
06:56:21,169 --> 06:56:22,689
So this is one.

6552
06:56:23,569 --> 06:56:26,930
Maybe in like two and three, they'll start to...

6553
06:56:27,729 --> 06:56:29,729
There's been some criticisms of this game already.

6554
06:56:30,849 --> 06:56:36,849
I have faith that Supermassive will, over the next few games in this anthology,

6555
06:56:36,849 --> 06:56:39,889
maybe kind of change it up a little bit.

6556
06:56:40,689 --> 06:56:50,659
Because I mean, they did do...

6557
06:56:50,659 --> 06:56:52,020
That they made Until Dawn.

6558
06:56:54,470 --> 06:56:56,150
If not, then that's a letdown.

6559
06:56:56,150 --> 06:56:59,909
Because there's not very many good horror experiences.

6560
06:57:01,080 --> 06:57:01,639
There are some.

6561
06:57:02,200 --> 06:57:09,400
But it's kind of hard to find a really, really truly good horror game.

6562
06:57:15,110 --> 06:57:16,310
At least in the last...

6563
06:57:17,270 --> 06:57:18,950
I'll wait.

6564
06:57:20,020 --> 06:57:22,340
At least in the last three or four years.

6565
06:57:22,340 --> 06:57:23,060
Five years or so.

6566
06:57:24,470 --> 06:57:25,029
Play Silent...

6567
06:57:25,029 --> 06:57:27,669
Yeah, Silent Hill 2 came out like 15 years ago.

6568
06:57:27,669 --> 06:57:28,869
I'm talking about like now.

6569
06:57:29,909 --> 06:57:32,950
I don't mean that there's never been a good horror game.

6570
06:57:33,750 --> 06:57:35,270
You know, there's never...

6571
06:57:35,270 --> 06:57:37,990
No, I'm talking about like the last like five years.

6572
06:57:38,709 --> 06:57:46,799
There's been a couple.

6573
06:57:46,799 --> 06:57:48,000
And I've played some of them already.

6574
06:57:51,090 --> 06:57:54,400
Resident Evil 2 was...

6575
06:57:54,400 --> 06:57:55,520
Resident Evil 7 was...

6576
06:57:56,479 --> 06:57:56,720
No.

6577
06:57:57,200 --> 06:57:58,400
Resident Evil 7...

6578
06:57:58,400 --> 06:58:02,560
The first like six hours of Resident Evil 7 was an awesome horror game.

6579
06:58:03,750 --> 06:58:05,509
And then they lost me for a little while.

6580
06:58:06,150 --> 06:58:07,779
And then the end was pretty good.

6581
06:58:11,590 --> 06:58:17,009
I didn't like that kind of mid to late game in Resident Evil 7.

6582
06:58:18,500 --> 06:58:20,659
On the boat with, you know...

6583
06:58:20,659 --> 06:58:21,939
But I don't want to give any spoilers.

6584
06:58:21,939 --> 06:58:25,939
But once it became not a scary game anymore, it was kind of just...

6585
06:58:28,919 --> 06:58:31,560
You know, I don't want to talk about it.

6586
06:58:31,560 --> 06:58:33,639
Because I don't know if people haven't played it yet.

6587
06:58:35,279 --> 06:58:36,720
But there was a big string there.

6588
06:58:36,720 --> 06:58:38,479
And I streamed that whole game in VR.

6589
06:58:39,119 --> 06:58:39,680
The whole game.

6590
06:58:43,860 --> 06:58:45,619
They lost me at that end part.

6591
06:58:45,619 --> 06:58:49,540
But the first like 6 to 12, 6 to 10 hours of Resident Evil 7 was fantastic.

6592
06:58:50,659 --> 06:58:53,459
We'll see if the next anthology games are any good.

6593
06:58:54,020 --> 06:59:03,599
But thank you to Demons V for the $15.

6594
06:59:05,430 --> 06:59:10,069
They say blood sacrifice and then like a face.

6595
06:59:11,750 --> 06:59:13,430
Thank you for the $15 Demons V.

6596
06:59:14,229 --> 06:59:15,380
Really appreciate it.

6597
06:59:17,650 --> 06:59:19,169
Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.

6598
06:59:20,840 --> 06:59:22,840
I'm fucking revoking your gamer license.

6599
06:59:23,560 --> 06:59:27,909
What gaming did I do tonight?

6600
06:59:37,490 --> 06:59:38,369
You can't do that.

6601
06:59:38,930 --> 06:59:44,630
But thank you, Sticks Renegade.

6602
06:59:44,630 --> 06:59:47,669
I didn't know you were an authority on the gamer licenses.

6603
06:59:51,959 --> 06:59:53,799
Shitty Viewbot, thanks for the $10.

6604
06:59:53,799 --> 06:59:56,200
Just admit, German buddy, you fucked up.

6605
06:59:58,639 --> 06:59:59,119
I did.

6606
06:59:59,119 --> 07:00:00,000
I know I did.

6607
07:00:00,000 --> 07:00:06,599
But it's all right.

6608
07:00:08,159 --> 07:00:08,560
I did.

6609
07:00:08,560 --> 07:00:09,119
I messed up.

6610
07:00:10,319 --> 07:00:12,479
But thank you for the $10, Shitty Viewbot.

6611
07:00:15,840 --> 07:00:17,200
Errorless, thanks for the $2.50.

6612
07:00:17,200 --> 07:00:19,439
Hey, Jerma, can you give these bits to italics, please?

6613
07:00:20,639 --> 07:00:25,919
Yeah, let me go to McDonald's and I buy him a McChicken.

6614
07:00:29,000 --> 07:00:29,479
Thank you, though.

6615
07:00:31,669 --> 07:00:33,189
Thank you, Trampston, for the $5.

6616
07:00:33,189 --> 07:00:38,790
I'm going to come through this monitor and give you a peck, a punch on the nose.

6617
07:00:38,790 --> 07:00:39,029
What?

6618
07:00:42,400 --> 07:00:44,720
We are going to, this is going to be an interesting,

6619
07:00:45,599 --> 07:00:48,790
this is going to be a very interesting credits

6620
07:00:50,880 --> 07:00:54,400
because the stream, Twitch had a ton of problems earlier tonight.

6621
07:00:55,119 --> 07:00:58,880
And the stream turned off like probably five to six times.

6622
07:00:59,439 --> 07:01:06,840
I am curious as to see if any of who even is on this list.

6623
07:01:08,799 --> 07:01:09,840
Still pretty significant.

6624
07:01:12,479 --> 07:01:16,159
Now, it was definitely not Cox because they were portions where

6625
07:01:17,439 --> 07:01:20,400
italics stream would be at zero and I would still be fine and live.

6626
07:01:21,200 --> 07:01:24,479
And other people were talking about how there was other streamers having problems.

6627
07:01:24,479 --> 07:01:26,319
So I guess it was because it stopped.

6628
07:01:27,200 --> 07:01:30,479
So I don't think that was a Cox thing tonight.

6629
07:01:31,040 --> 07:01:37,330
But thank you to, thank you Trampston.

6630
07:01:37,330 --> 07:01:37,810
Appreciate it.

6631
07:01:38,529 --> 07:01:40,099
What's the name of the song?

6632
07:01:40,099 --> 07:01:41,700
This is an original song by Blordo.

6633
07:01:42,340 --> 07:01:45,880
This is an original made for the end of this stream song.

6634
07:01:55,240 --> 07:01:58,599
Speaking of which, I have, I still have stuff that I have to put on.

6635
07:01:59,240 --> 07:02:03,729
It seems like every day something else is like happening

6636
07:02:04,369 --> 07:02:05,970
that like I can't just sit down and do it.

6637
07:02:07,299 --> 07:02:10,180
But I do, I have new stuff from Blordo.

6638
07:02:10,180 --> 07:02:10,659
I have it.

6639
07:02:11,380 --> 07:02:14,099
I have to just set it up and do it and set up the scenes and everything.

6640
07:02:14,099 --> 07:02:16,020
And I just haven't, I just haven't been able to sit down and do it.

6641
07:02:22,200 --> 07:02:23,400
Yes, you will see that.

6642
07:02:24,360 --> 07:02:26,919
I'm, it's, it has to be.

6643
07:02:27,720 --> 07:02:32,369
Like the next time I stream after this weekend, it'll all be there.

6644
07:02:32,369 --> 07:02:32,930
It has to be.

6645
07:02:32,930 --> 07:02:34,130
Like I've held on for too long.

6646
07:02:34,770 --> 07:02:42,930
That is good shit though.

6647
07:02:43,490 --> 07:02:44,290
You guys are gonna like it.

6648
07:02:49,700 --> 07:02:50,340
OST.

6649
07:02:50,340 --> 07:02:51,380
A German I-95.

6650
07:02:51,380 --> 07:02:52,259
OST.

6651
07:02:58,580 --> 07:02:59,779
Need some more emotes too.

6652
07:02:59,779 --> 07:03:04,869
Yeah, I gotta do a whole, once the carnival stream is done,

6653
07:03:05,590 --> 07:03:09,490
I'll have a lot more brain power to actually sit down.

6654
07:03:09,970 --> 07:03:12,130
There's a lot going on this in September.

6655
07:03:12,130 --> 07:03:13,970
The carnival stream is coming up really soon.

6656
07:03:14,689 --> 07:03:16,689
TwitchCon is right after that.

6657
07:03:18,279 --> 07:03:21,639
So my brain is kind of all over the place this month.

6658
07:03:22,360 --> 07:03:29,240
But good night everybody.

6659
07:03:30,759 --> 07:03:32,040
We'll see you tomorrow if you show up.

6660
07:03:32,840 --> 07:03:36,689
Am I going to TwitchCon?

6661
07:03:36,689 --> 07:03:37,090
I am.

6662
07:03:39,139 --> 07:03:44,369
But I am going to because of the carnival stream.

6663
07:03:45,799 --> 07:03:47,000
I'm not gonna go the whole time.

6664
07:03:48,389 --> 07:03:51,990
So I will only be at TwitchCon for like a day or two.

6665
07:03:52,709 --> 07:03:59,169
So I'm not gonna be there from Thursday to Monday or what a lot of people usually do.

6666
07:04:00,130 --> 07:04:05,400
But I will be there for at least a day or two.

6667
07:04:06,119 --> 07:04:17,560
When's the new Discord channel going up for videos, art, and all that?

6668
07:04:18,799 --> 07:04:20,080
I'm gonna talk to...

6669
07:04:21,200 --> 07:04:24,959
I will have like a little mod thing tomorrow.

6670
07:04:25,680 --> 07:04:28,240
Tomorrow after my stream I'll just get that all set up.

6671
07:04:28,240 --> 07:04:33,599
I'm also gonna get a hard date for the activity book stream after tomorrow's stream.

6672
07:04:33,599 --> 07:04:35,840
So I'll give you all this information soon.

6673
07:04:36,799 --> 07:04:39,939
I'm gonna see who's around tomorrow to talk about it all.

6674
07:04:42,880 --> 07:04:43,520
So stay tuned.

6675
07:04:45,569 --> 07:04:47,009
But I will see you guys tomorrow.

6676
07:04:47,729 --> 07:04:48,209
Take care.

6677
07:04:49,279 --> 07:04:52,560
Until then, goodbye for now.

6678
07:04:52,560 --> 07:04:54,580
See you later.
