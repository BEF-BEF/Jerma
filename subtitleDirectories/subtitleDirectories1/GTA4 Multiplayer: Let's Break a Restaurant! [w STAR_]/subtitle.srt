1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,419
You didn't order any food.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,500
Oh, I gotta order the food first. Hold-

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,700
Okay, ladies, hold on.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,179
All right, so you want a chicken sandwich.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,679
You want-

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,599
Okay, ma. I get it. I understand.

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:31,879
I'm really sorry. They don't have any more chicken sandwiches.

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,520
Sorry, mom. I know you're mad about it.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,299
I'm back. I got- What did you want?

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,100
My mother needs a chicken sandwich.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,619
Okay, let's just- I gotta back up and go get it.

12
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,070
It's in the back.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,469
Hold on. It's in the back.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,159
Hold on. I think I got it. I got it.

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,119
I got it. Coming back.

16
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,460
Here's a chicken sandwich.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,099
How the fuck are you riding this motorcycle?

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,909
Where did- Wait, there are employees in here now.

19
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:18,950
There's employees in here.

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,150
What the fuck?

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,590
Where did the employees come from?

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,030
There's people sitting in here too.

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,250
There's all these dead bodies that they're just sitting on.

24
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,450
You have the door locked. They're just skiing around.

25
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,260
How do we get out of here?

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,329
What did we do?

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,299
Do you see me?

28
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,219
Yes, dude. It's on a motorcycle.

29
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm in the ghost world. I can't see anything in here.

30
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,469
This is the most ghost world I've ever seen, Jerma.

31
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,750
All right, so you're in the ghost world.

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,909
You are bumping into these ladies.

33
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,430
This entire room is empty.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,430
Just start throwing punches.

35
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:08,789
You punched a lady.

36
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,900
Guide me. I'm in the ghost world.

37
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,189
Okay. Closing all this.

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,090
I have no idea.

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,340
Dude, that was ridiculous. Just two random workers.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,219
I got to get out of here.

41
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,419
I got to get out of the ghost world.

42
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,539
I can't take this anymore.

43
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,060
Oh my God. I don't want to go back to the real world.

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,960
Jerma.

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,979
I'm playing The Sims.

46
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,300
None of this is making any sense.

47
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,659
I'm playing The Sims right now.

48
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,500
This is my house in The Sims.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,379
Oh, there's one of my players.

50
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,419
There he is.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,139
No, Jerma. No.

52
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,780
What if I get out?

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm stuck in the ghost world.

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,979
I think we're both stuck in the ghost world.

55
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,340
Do you see what I'm seeing?

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,860
Nope. It's gone.

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,900
Jerma, the burger shot.

58
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,020
Currently. Okay. Here I come, captain.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,210
Jerma, the burger shot.

60
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,270
Hey, Jerma.

61
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,120
It's too bad you did the pillow jump into bedfall.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,939
Get up. Get up.

63
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:41,740
What are you, a punk?

64
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,099
You're probably going to want to stand outside the burger shot for this one.

65
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,060
And just look in.

66
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,300
I have no control of my character.

67
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,360
Again.

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,879
Why am I going into burger shot?

69
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm just going to let this play out.

70
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,780
Oh, okay.

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,659
Let's pump the gas.

72
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,490
Where's your car?

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:02,969
All right.

74
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,449
No. Okay.

75
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,050
We're going to play house.

76
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,550
Okay.

77
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:06,490
We're not house.

78
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,449
We're going to play like work.

79
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,409
What about the gas?

80
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,210
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

81
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,539
You get in a car and you pull up.

82
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,500
See this person.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,780
We have to like give gas.

84
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,389
God damn it.

85
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,720
Nice driving, idiot.

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
This guy's trying to get gas.

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,439
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,399
Sir.

89
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,240
You're going to pull up further.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Pull up further.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,779
Let me help you.

92
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:27,339
He won't.

93
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,779
I would like some gas, please.

94
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,279
No.

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,560
There's cop cars everywhere.

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,240
So you're just getting gas.

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not like you're doing anything bad.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,500
What?

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,100
What?

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,839
Where did that come from?

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,279
Why did that?

102
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,680
Hold on.

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,240
Get over here.

104
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,250
This person just drove off the bridge.

105
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,600
What was the point of that?

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,019
They're still trying to accelerate.

107
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,689
He's still in there.

108
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,290
This guy drove off the bridge.

109
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,769
He really wanted to play house with us.

110
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:04,250
I know.

111
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,370
He wanted to come get gas.

112
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,370
Well, that made him get out.

113
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,290
Oh, now he's coming after you.

114
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,009
He's going to kick your ass.

115
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,610
I'll lure him to the gas station.

116
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:17,930
All right.

117
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,410
Yeah.

118
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,610
Lure him to the gas station.

119
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,449
He's wicked fast.

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Oh, my God.

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,220
He is.

122
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,069
This guy is on so many drugs right now.

123
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:30,889
All right.

124
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,250
So what are we going to...

125
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,250
Where is he going?

126
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,610
I think he...

127
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,329
I got my bro with me.

128
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm pretty sure he forgets where you are.

129
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:40,939
This guy.

130
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,399
You leave this guy alone.

131
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,129
Dude, it bounced.

132
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:47,610
Hold on.

133
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,170
Come here.

134
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,769
No, shit.

135
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:56,009
No.

136
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:56,970
I didn't mean to...

137
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,610
It's cute.

138
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,410
So yeah, you're dead.

139
00:05:59,129 --> 00:05:59,920
No, I'm fine.

140
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,420
It fell off.

141
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,399
Fuck you.

142
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,120
God, that's a huge crash.

143
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,079
You, shag.

144
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:23,180
So loud.

145
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,089
Fuck you.

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Screw you, bitch.

147
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,620
It's like a crack in that window.

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,160
I need to help you on this one.

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,649
Somebody got wrecked.

150
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:45,850
Do you see this guy?

151
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:04,889
All right.

152
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,290
Let's go wreck somebody's car.
