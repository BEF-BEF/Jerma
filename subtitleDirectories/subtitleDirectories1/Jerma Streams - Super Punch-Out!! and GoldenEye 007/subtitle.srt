1
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, so let's I'm gonna go over the rules of this challenge

2
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:32,380
This is super punch out and this is gonna go as follows. No, no knockdowns

3
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:42,689
Let's see if I can do it. We don't need to bet. Can I do this with no knockdowns for me?

4
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:50,100
No TKOs or no knockdowns at all. That's gonna be really hard, but we'll see

5
00:00:53,030 --> 00:01:07,120
All right, you ready? I got it up right here. All right, so super punch out is one of my favorite games

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,390
Pretty much ever. I'd say it's in the top 20 top 10. Mmm, maybe top 20. I

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,599
Gotta remember how the controls button setting mode. Hold on

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,340
All right B is right punch left punches Y and then a is the knockout punch power up is yeah, that's fine

9
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:39,090
Okay, that's all I need a is the big punch you guys ready? No

10
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,129
Knockdowns. What's the penalty if I fail every time I get knocked down I

11
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:53,989
For every time I get knocked down what's a good thing to put here? I'm gonna say this game sucks. It does not come on

12
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,620
Every time you get knocked down one stream of tears of the kingdom. Oh

13
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:17,030
No, no, I don't think so it's not that I don't want to do that

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,229
I don't want to give people the idea that if let's say I just am completely wrong and I'm just really rusting

15
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,770
I can't do this if I get knocked down ten times

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:35,960
I didn't even stream breath of the wild ten times every five knockdowns. You need to do that

17
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,300
Do you hate Zelda? No, I just I just don't never was really into the franchise really

18
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,740
Like I said, that's the first time I played Zelda since Ocarina of Time

19
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:56,259
Just kind of let it all pass by me for some reason. All right

20
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,620
Well, it's not gonna happen here so we can figure it out. It's just I'm I might not even get hurt here

21
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:49,740
Okay, good. Yay fall down. Oh, come on. Oh fuck. I forgot. That's what that move did

22
00:03:49,740 --> 00:04:02,099
I thought I had an extra second. I thought I had an extra second. He's not getting up. Don't worry

23
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:09,580
We're good. It's knockdowns not taking damage. I got hit by Gabby J, but it's okay

24
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:26,769
That's not a knockdown who's after Gabby J. It's that's from when I played with me. All right. Yeah

25
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:35,959
Bear hugger. No punching is a great rule. What?

26
00:04:38,370 --> 00:05:11,379
Okay, could I had it full health play the Wii one? I did a long time ago

27
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,220
I want to say like a few years like three four years ago. Whoa

28
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,500
At why well, it's happening. Okay, there we go

29
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:41,259
Bear hugger really showed up and nothing but overalls. Yeah, do you think they'll ever do another punch-out game?

30
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:47,740
Cuz we got a punch-out Wii and then they kind of just didn't really ever do it again

31
00:05:48,259 --> 00:06:00,959
All right. I have to remember the pattern here

32
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,399
Because you can get caught and I think it's either it starts up or it starts down and I don't remember

33
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,579
I might take a little bit damage here

34
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:29,110
I actually might put on the other controller for this because the d-pad is on this thing stinks

35
00:06:29,110 --> 00:07:02,560
I thought I almost had it in one hit sit down. Yes. How did this guy not beat Ganon?

36
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:11,290
Oh, you said I did you say beat Ganon or not beat Ganon? Is the game easy?

37
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,310
Not the first circuit kind of is but this is where it heats up a little

38
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:26,430
The game is actually it's about just patterns and memorization. See I just remember every single thing that these guys do

39
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:44,600
I have to catch it because otherwise you die in one hit. Can I catch it? What do you guys think?

40
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,750
He charges at you and he'll kill you in one swing. I don't know follow your heart

41
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:18,500
We might not even have to we might not even see it. Hold on. There it is. Fuck

42
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I just ripped up my fucking power cable

43
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:35,610
Challenge is over. I ripped it. Hold on a second. I was a little late

44
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:50,440
Too bad I got cocky you don't have to do that, but I just got really cocky. It's okay

45
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,289
See you have to do this

46
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:08,789
You do have to catch him though. Maybe no, actually. Yeah, I got cocky. That's my own fault. I just want to that's one

47
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:18,610
Tears of the kingdom stream. No, I didn't agree to that. Damn it

48
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:30,720
I was thinking I was gonna get through that without getting knocked down once the other

49
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:39,080
Germa beat it three seconds faster than I did. I did better than I did before though

50
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:54,240
All right circuit to this is

51
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,330
Charlie there's who else is in this? Where's the clown? The clown is really hard

52
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:16,309
I shouldn't even be alternating swinging actually to the gut so far so good. Oh, all right

53
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:47,090
This is I remember this he goes this way. There you go. See you later. Got a quick. Oh

54
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:01,570
All right, that's that's pretty rare. Almost 30 seconds. That's pretty good

55
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,649
31 99 that's way faster than I did it before

56
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:25,519
Look at a minute 30 from when I did it last time forget what this guy does. He's just like a kick

57
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:38,519
There's like two or three kicks you have to be aware about the timing on this guy's kind of weird, too. Ah

58
00:11:39,159 --> 00:12:05,549
Shit, that's my fault. He's a heel. Oh, it's down. It's down. Yep. Got it

59
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:22,539
That'll kill you in one hit by the way. I'm not being efficient either. I should be way more efficient than this

60
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:30,519
This is sloppy. I should be hitting him

61
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:41,639
Two or three times before it as you can hit him up to a certain amount of times when you do that like one two

62
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,840
Three four, okay, so do three one two, three swing

63
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,799
Whoa, that was close. He really is go to the games with two buttons

64
00:12:49,799 --> 00:13:09,799
I told you just give me three buttons in a directional and I got it better than before

65
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,299
All right, this guy there's nothing flashy

66
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:31,960
Uh, he just has a ton of health and he hurts a lot and his timings are a little weighty spits in your face, too

67
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,639
I think it's you have to do down. Let's try it. Yep. Spit. Got it

68
00:13:36,200 --> 00:14:02,350
It is funny how that happens, huh? Oh, no, don't sit. Don't talk now try to catch him there. Oh

69
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,909
Don't be silly

70
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,909
Don't be silly about this

71
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:09,549
Oh, and the d-pad fucked up. Nice

72
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:28,320
No downs, that's the hell second circuit. I'm even i'm eating frozen grapes right now. They're goaded

73
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:47,259
They are so good. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it

74
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:57,710
I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it

75
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:09,259
I'm even i'm eating frozen grapes right now. They're goaded

76
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,879
They are so delicious. Honestly

77
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,279
I actually uh, holly and I tried the

78
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:24,200
Frozen blueberries that a lot of people are talking about. They're up there too and no joking around

79
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,360
I actually really do mean this if you're actually having trouble getting fruits and vegetables into your diet

80
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,039
It's a it's a great way to do it frozen blueberries and frozen grapes seedless

81
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:47,659
Red grapes, by the way, I look forward to eating these. It's not like oh, yeah

82
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,779
Like I I have to eat vegetables and fruits about it. I eat like a pizza today

83
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,470
Did I even eat anything good for me? Oh, I got frozen blueberries and frozen grapes in the freezer

84
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,269
You they're like a little treat. You look forward to eating them

85
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,279
It's a really good way to get some um extra fruits in your diet. Seriously

86
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, and when they come out of the okay, this one's gonna be hard but

87
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Uh when they come out of the freezer

88
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,080
Don't just just chomp on them. Let them sit out for a minute or two

89
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,159
Let them get a little bit softer on the outside

90
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,600
I don't know. Maybe you like it like that

91
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,230
I I like it kind of frozen but just don't bite into them. It's like a popsicle. I forget what this guy does

92
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:38,600
I have to stop talking. Yeah, he does the triple. That's what it is. Okay

93
00:16:39,799 --> 00:17:01,870
Okay, that usually kills you i'm good

94
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Damn it

95
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:41,960
I thought he did it twice one more hour of tears of the kingdom. Yep. That thing is brutal by the way

96
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:06,799
How come I can't block what's going on with that? Usually you can block up. Come on, man

97
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:18,619
What the fuck

98
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,380
All right, the d-pad on the pro controller really is like an absolute piece of shit

99
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:43,160
It's one gigantic button that when you press left you press all the buttons at the same time use the joy cons

100
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,470
I actually yeah, that's a good idea

101
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,150
No, I think i'll be fine way worse than the other jeremy by the way

102
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,869
All right. Well, that's all right. It's two downs

103
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,980
No losses though, which are good because I want to

104
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,539
Hopefully do no losses

105
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:20,200
Okay, aaron ryan, this is this guy has it's all about the lower blocking

106
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:34,269
He's gonna grab

107
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,430
Shit

108
00:19:36,430 --> 00:20:00,009
You can usually catch him right there. Come on, dude. Here it comes. Okay, I got it

109
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:13,519
Whoa, you're still going

110
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,119
Cool, we're good

111
00:20:15,119 --> 00:21:18,650
All right. Let me get some help back almost had it again. It starts it up. I think come on

112
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:30,599
Right. Yeah, this is it. No

113
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,579
Shit

114
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:54,089
Sit down

115
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:56,460
three tears of the kingdom

116
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,880
minutes

117
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,990
Looking at it on the nintendo shop store page and you believe it

118
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:21,769
That's actually I think the harder of all the ones in this final circuit something with the hair is a hair flip

119
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:28,539
There's a hair flip. I forget which I forget which side it's on. I think it's a hair flip on the left side, I think

120
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:51,880
Find out

121
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,609
Good. It's a good start. I got full health. I'm good

122
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,190
Oh that was started early, okay, which side is it on?

123
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,109
I think it's okay. It's left and then it's down. That's what it is. I got it

124
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:41,579
All right, get some help. Whoo

125
00:23:42,220 --> 00:24:03,119
See you later. I did it. All right. We're almost there only two more. That was pretty good. That was clean

126
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,240
Not as clean as uh, uh

127
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,619
Here's the clown

128
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:26,720
All right clown does this just move with the balls. So it's a bear hugger skin, but forget some things

129
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,559
Yep, it's that other way. They trick you. That's a one-hit kill by the way. Good start

130
00:24:35,599 --> 00:25:06,400
Whoo

131
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,670
How fast is the speed run? It's probably ridiculous. Where did that come from?

132
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:37,529
All right. Well, we did it. No doubts. Would you fight a 400 pound clown in real life if I had to?

133
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:52,380
That was way better than the last time I played it. Okay, uh, this is the last boss of the game

134
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,700
uh

135
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,220
technically

136
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,859
This guy

137
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:04,519
Has a bunch of really awful stuff. I don't know if i'll do it, but i'll try he has this

138
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:25,680
Spin overhead swing move. They have to duck under like three times. Hi

139
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:59,720
There it is. Okay when he goes i'm out of rhythm. I thought he was gonna spin shit

140
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,849
Oh

141
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:17,309
No, I got it. I got it. This guy sucks. He does a little hop too. It's awful

142
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:50,140
Oh, that's it. Can you tell how frequently i've gotten to the end here? We're doing this by the way

143
00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:06,640
It's rewinding. Is it block? How do you do that? Let me see. Is it I think it's just block up

144
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,059
Maybe it is just up. Let me see you do it again

145
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,059
No

146
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:35,759
Sometimes he does it three times. Damn it. Yeah, it's already over. I I couldn't beat the final boss and without being down

147
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,839
It's over fine. I don't care

148
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,750
This guy is very hard

149
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,250
Shit

150
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:59,529
It's so funny. You can see you can just tell when you just get so full just so out

151
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:08,000
This is a rhythm game and it's very hard look at how much i'm getting hit right now

152
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,079
This i've taken more punches in the last 10 seconds than the last 40 minutes playing this game

153
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:39,759
It's just a rhythm game. It's like playing rhythm heaven. It's that little left jab or right jab. It's just

154
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,430
All right. How do I block that? Maybe just don't move. That's what it is. Okay, you just don't move

155
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,200
shit

156
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:17,609
All right, so the reason why I did that because if you lose if you actually get a loss

157
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,549
Uh, you are 100% locked out of doing the final circuit ever

158
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,029
You have to do you have to beat every single

159
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:32,859
Uh enemy you have to do every single fight without losing the only way you can get the last actual

160
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:38,319
Um circuit. Oh my god. That was really bad from the last time

161
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
So now special circuit is open

162
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,849
Now the reason why I said I could get to here without being downed. Yeah

163
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,299
Really age well when I said that because that's uh, that didn't happen

164
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Okay, so uh, but I get to do this now and this is impossible this is actually like almost impossible

165
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,480
This is very very very hard. Actually when I was a kid

166
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:17,019
Uh, I only saw this one time i've never actually truly played through this part except I did

167
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,640
In more recent years, but when I was younger and I played this all the time

168
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,440
I it was it was rare to even get here because remember I didn't have a safe state

169
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:35,599
I do remember this is a really cool fight though, because you'll see watch this

170
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,660
He doesn't want you to do something very in particular

171
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,170
You can't hit him in the face until he gets angry

172
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,240
and he loses composure

173
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,279
and he

174
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,920
and gets mad at uh calamity ganon and uh

175
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:02,960
You will see

176
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
Yeah, my experience with this guy is I think i've seen this guy twice ever

177
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,599
Let's do it. I mean if I cheat, I don't care. Let's see the whole thing

178
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:29,319
All right, no more talking because I can't play video games talk at the same time. That was weird

179
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,880
Those of you that don't know what i'm talking about while you're playing the next game that you play

180
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,480
That's really like kind of a hard game. We have to pay attention. Just start talking out loud

181
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:54,269
You're gonna get killed you'll get hit like by everything that the monster does

182
00:32:54,509 --> 00:33:33,480
I forget what's after this guy. Oh, that was a cool move

183
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:48,539
I can only hit him once here. Come on. What is this? There we go. The next boss is so hard. I forget who it is

184
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,099
Why do I not remember?

185
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:55,150
Well, let's see

186
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:17,679
I'm, not even on here

187
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,849
I'm, not on here. I must not have done it

188
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,769
Okay

189
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,769
Please take it easy on a poor old man

190
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,070
What the fuck was that? Okay

191
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,960
Uh, oh my goodness

192
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,170
You have to hit him on opposites

193
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:52,170
Wow, goodbye. That was that was ugly

194
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:03,530
So you have to alternate I think maybe I can stand still for that

195
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:15,880
Jeez duck, maybe I can only do it twice. What about hold on? Let me get that down. What is this? Is it up?

196
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,880
One, two, three

197
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Sideways. Okay. That's one two, three sideways

198
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,610
goodness, jesus

199
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:42,590
Only two. Oh that kick hurts a lot

200
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,000
Can you imagine having to beat go through the entire game and not lose?

201
00:35:51,480 --> 00:36:00,489
And then get to this guy and win or you have to do the whole thing all over again god

202
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,119
Which way does he go? I guess

203
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:14,699
The movements are really erratic too plus him having a cane

204
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,269
It's kind of like it's hard to tell when he's gonna swing or punch, but let's see what we can do

205
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:48,269
Ooh, I had power there. No, I want to get that. You know, I don't

206
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:55,159
I don't think i've ever seen the end of this game. Who's at the end? I'm, really curious now actually

207
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:37,630
Okay, well this is the first time i've downed him that's good at least i'm gonna I can get downed once

208
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,059
I should do for the health anyways

209
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:53,309
All right, this guy's gonna have to play so much zelda

210
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:09,550
God damn it, man. I don't even know how you would memorize this even playing here normally. Jesus. That's a good opportunity. I'm gonna take it

211
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:34,320
That's a good opportunity to hit. No, no, no. No, that does not count. That doesn't count either

212
00:38:34,480 --> 00:39:15,079
Doesn't count either that was greedy. That was stupid. So it's up up down down

213
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Let me see the whole thing

214
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,800
Up up up up up up down down down down. Okay

215
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:44,090
Ouch that didn't count now. I know why i've never seen what's after this guy because I definitely got here even while cheating

216
00:39:44,170 --> 00:40:03,340
I probably was like nah, fuck this. I'd rather go eat like a sandwich or something. Okay, I can end it right here

217
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:12,889
Let's go. I've never seen this before. Yeah, I physically don't even know what the next fighter is

218
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:22,440
If you had irl safe dates, what would you try to master a professional sport?

219
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:34,030
Um, definitely something that with repetition not something with pure physical strength. Hmm

220
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,170
What physical sport?

221
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,250
What could I I don't know?

222
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,849
rick bruiser

223
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:57,150
My brother may be champ, but only because I let him win really I am the best I have seen this before

224
00:40:57,469 --> 00:41:04,340
How come I don't remember? Okay, let's i'm gonna concentrate

225
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:24,400
That's weird. I don't like it. Okay, I guess I have to hit him in the stomach there. That was a counter-attack

226
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:38,829
Whoa, no, it's an elbow. Wait, let's go all the way back shit. God damn it

227
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:51,639
Doing all right starting out

228
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:24,380
Oh the counter-attack he does it every time oh, come on, dude, stop

229
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:34,280
It's up down. Hold on. No, no, no. No, it's your brain just wants to dodge so bad

230
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:43,079
It's don't move and then up and then left. Okay, don't move up left and then no punch

231
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:56,110
It's the same. No, it's up up down up up. Why'd you dodge up up down? Okay up

232
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,199
left

233
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,269
Fuck I forgot he does it again

234
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:13,519
This guy's ridiculous

235
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:25,500
Sit down at the first down of the second

236
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:46,300
Imagine save scumming this much. Okay, so that one's down up down

237
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:59,690
What? Oh, no, it's down up left. I wonder how many kids cried playing this like you have to have cried

238
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:37,070
You have to have cried right? Like I probably cried. Yeah, I had to have cried shit. Oh, that's a wanted kill. Oh

239
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,070
I forgot again

240
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,530
I'm, just trying not to get so bad shit

241
00:44:47,079 --> 00:45:15,579
Okay, that's two up down left. No, it's down up down up left. Oh my goodness gracious

242
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:34,570
Even when you know it too. I tried to dodge it. It's like a half second window. I tried to dodge it again

243
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:46,570
No, no, no, no go back. I made it worse somehow. How did I just make it worse?

244
00:45:46,889 --> 00:46:09,019
Oh, you can hit you on the way down too. Oh, it's like fighting margit for the first time, you know

245
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:16,079
It's like here comes this right you're dead. Only thing is I can't do this at margit

246
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,469
All right, we need to go way back. So before this went off completely collapsed

247
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:47,199
There we go, can I block it? Let me see if I can block it up. No, I can't here we go

248
00:46:50,090 --> 00:47:01,760
Tried to dodge it too. All right, let's see what happens. I've never seen this before. This isn't a challenge anymore

249
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,639
Well, no, I mean this is

250
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:18,619
This is content i've never seen before. So what's after this?

251
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,860
Oh, no

252
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,699
It's just hard mode. Uh

253
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,860
Even with superpowers. I still think I don't think I can beat him

254
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:44,840
Can you imagine that imagine having save states a magical power and you still can't beat this guy?

255
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,179
so quick

256
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:54,119
No way. Oh my god

257
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,510
Okay

258
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,789
You have to alternate

259
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:24,559
He just broke my hand running his safe states actually are really tricky because you're just not ready to fight

260
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:35,639
It's you there's no rhythm with a safe state. Okay, so he breaks your hand if you punch him in the stomach, so don't do that

261
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,090
holy shit, that was

262
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:57,150
Immediate whatever it was. It's oh do it. Oh, whoa. He does two. Okay the double follow-up

263
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:02,199
Then is it duck I wonder I don't know

264
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,559
Please

265
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:35,289
Oh, how can I not? How did I not hit him? There's so much mix up here. Oh my god. He dodged it

266
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,000
Left up. Yep

267
00:49:47,400 --> 00:50:08,139
Left down up. No, it's down up down up down up left down up right down down

268
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:14,139
Down, okay down up left

269
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,099
Down up down right left. Holy shit, dude. No, no kids beat this

270
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:29,210
Up up. No, it's different. He changes it every time

271
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,590
I'm done. That was fun. That was fun at one. I'm uh

272
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:46,940
I mean at this point i'm just literally gonna be saving state after every punch and that's not even gonna help

273
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:03,760
Yeah, it changes every time it looks like you can't hit him in the middle of this

274
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:10,929
Fuck can't even win with cheating. That's how you know. This is unbelievable

275
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:24,110
He just swings so often that you if you're not in the rhythm it's impossible down up left up down left

276
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:28,510
No, i'm done. I'm gonna play gold die for fucking an hour

277
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,579
Okay down up left

278
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:48,980
Does it change I feel like I can't even process that he's doing anything down up left up down

279
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:02,079
He keeps going. Holy shit

280
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,889
All right, you watch a youtube video if you want to see the rest

281
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:17,739
I'm, not doing this anymore. That was cool. I've it's cool to see this other guy for the first time ever

282
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:29,630
Um, this is fun. Let's play gold night. I I mean you you want to do the guy that's that's designed

283
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:34,610
For you to take like 75 in quarters from you with the arcade. I don't believe so

284
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:41,550
Imagine okay think of it might be putting quarters in I just put in a quarter right now

285
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,079
By the way, I don't think there even was quarters. This is the super nintendo version

286
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:02,690
The arcade version was back in the regular nintendo era. Yeah, let's play gold night. That was fun

287
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,420
Fuck this guy. I'm not doing that

288
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:21,300
I want to play one level in gold night that I remember the arcade version was a different game

289
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,820
Yeah, but it came out around the same. Um era as the nes one, right? Is that what I remember?

290
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:29,860
I want to play

291
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:35,630
Gold and I I want to get to level two. I'm not going to play this for very long. I just want to do it

292
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:49,260
Oh, okay. Here we go

293
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,429
Like mission damn. All right, i'm gonna do secret agent

294
00:53:52,989 --> 00:54:10,139
Neutralize all alarms and bungee jump off the platform. You guys remember this game. I remember this game

295
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,219
Cool

296
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:17,260
Anything else? Nah, that's it. I just remember it. Do you yeah. Oh, all right good

297
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
so gold and I

298
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Those this game auto aims

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,940
I don't know

300
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,940
Whoa, wait a sec

301
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,699
Okay, so it's left and right

302
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:47,630
Left and right the right. Okay, that's inverted. We are not doing that. We're not doing that. Can this be changed?

303
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:59,059
Okay, there we go upright is fine auto aim is on aim control i'm gonna say hold is fine

304
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:13,619
Okay, already people attacking me. How do you shoot? This guy sucks at shooting

305
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:21,550
All right

306
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,550
I love the the death sounds

307
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:25,949
that like

308
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:44,210
All right, it's left trigger to shoot I think it's how do you change weapons there we go, okay

309
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,420
All right, we're doing fine

310
00:55:51,420 --> 00:56:05,789
The pencil no, that's the duracell battery. That's the double packet of double-a batteries. Okay. Was there anything up here?

311
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,510
Isn't there body armor or something here? Oh, yep. Give me that

312
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,739
sniper rifle

313
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:18,769
All right, get out of here

314
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:21,809
Yep, there's a wall in front of me. Where is the glass?

315
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,570
What?

316
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:28,590
Is there there's no jump right?

317
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:41,699
Through this game. I forgot how weirdly this game was controlled

318
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:46,880
All right, here we go. So left right bumper

319
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:53,679
And then left stick and then left trigger it's like the opposite of what a game controls like nowadays

320
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:05,300
All right, get him

321
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,860
Grandma put on the vr helmet for the first time ever

322
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:33,199
Okay, uh, give me the other gun. Yeah. No, no this thing

323
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:49,300
Nothing up there. That was a really fast knife. Yeah, it was kind of semi-automatic

324
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,900
I'm dizzy

325
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:03,619
Yeah, me too, but we'll be all right

326
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:22,239
Uh, I have to press this button. You have to do a bunch of control changes in the menu to make it feel more modern

327
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,590
Uh, i'll I don't mind I get used to it. It's gonna take a minute or two

328
00:58:43,820 --> 00:59:10,699
Thanks roll. Can't you change this game to be widescreen? Oh great. Why are they not aiming at me?

329
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:40,989
Okay, we're good. Oh, what's this open that up? Can I I just want to do the facility?

330
00:59:40,989 --> 01:00:02,769
That's the only one I want to play open the facility is the best level in the whole game, especially on multiplayer

331
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:22,130
This is so epic. Hey, i'll be honest with you though

332
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:30,190
Um, i'll show my age here a little bit here. This was the coolest thing to ever come out in like 30 years. This was

333
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,110
My fortnight guys. This is the shit that I played when I was like 12 13 14

334
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:55,469
I am holding i'm moving the right stick which is that's just burned in your brain permanently

335
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:03,730
What I'm with it was something else. Oh, yeah

336
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:09,969
Imagine sitting around i'm gonna paint it. Let me paint a picture for you

337
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,940
imagine sitting around a

338
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,340
square

339
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,760
like

340
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,760
19-inch square television

341
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:21,949
Four people huddled around it

342
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,539
four split screen player co-op

343
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:28,829
You had the amount of viewing angle

344
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,630
That is on an iphone right now

345
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:56,719
And we loved every second of it. It's already in here

346
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:01,170
You're gonna play lies of p. Um

347
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:06,280
Probably not at least not immediately

348
01:02:07,949 --> 01:02:13,260
whoa

349
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,809
It was from all the way down. Okay. I'm just gonna leave that guy

350
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,420
Now enough of the explosion. I might not even get through this level

351
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:45,090
i'm in trouble

352
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:51,619
Isn't this this is the end up coming up right here, right?

353
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:56,909
There are no saves, uh rewinds in um in this game

354
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,360
Although I could do this

355
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:10,989
Wait, how do I get to it?

356
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:35,920
We're cheating. Just want to do the first part of the facility. That's it. I didn't win. Um

357
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,170
What is the there's like a side?

358
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:47,409
Where do I go? I remember it's like a boat

359
01:03:48,880 --> 01:04:03,840
Oh, yeah, you go this way. Honestly vr controls would be easier

360
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:17,840
Wait, where is it mission status incomplete? No. Oh, is it because I did the secret agent mode?

361
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:49,059
Do I have to complete everything other side down here? Just jump off the first tower. Why don't you jump off the dam?

362
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:53,730
Oh my goodness

363
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,610
Yeah

364
01:04:54,610 --> 01:05:00,780
Holding left holding right stick left and not moving left is like I may as well be playing backwards

365
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:19,219
This is from all the very first tower. You actually don't have to come all the way down here

366
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:34,530
It's been a very long time. What's that on the other side?

367
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:39,340
Wait fake fan

368
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,980
Yeah, let me go. Let me go wake up. Jeremy from when he was 17 and be like, hey, dude

369
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:46,769
Why the fuck don't you remember this?

370
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:52,449
Hey, you were 14 25 years ago. Why don't you remember where the bungee jump is stupid?

371
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
I'll go tell him i'm gonna go tell him

372
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:14,269
Yeah, i'm gonna tell him right now. Okay. This is the level I actually wanted to play

373
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,860
Oh god, damn it

374
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:24,690
Do I actually have to do it again?

375
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:30,050
Because you have to destroy if you can't just beat it. That's why you only that's why you don't do secret agent first

376
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:46,139
Nobody told him check this out. He didn't pull the shoot

377
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,699
I just want to do the thing in the facility. It's my favorite level

378
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:57,679
All right, come down. Oh, don't press that. That's the alarm. Give me that thing. I know this thing is good

379
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,260
I remember using it. No, there it is. I love this weapon. It's like the best weapon

380
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:11,699
When you get two of these it's so fun

381
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:34,850
All right. There we go

382
01:08:34,850 --> 01:09:06,060
Hey, there it is. All right best level in the game. Let's go so you can really mess this up a million different ways

383
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:15,460
Um, we'll see how well I do this, but I remember this in particular doing multiplayer

384
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:23,779
Uh when you got to be up here hiding in the bathroom was always the most fun thing ever because in multiplayer

385
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,340
Yeah, you could screen cheat but come on in. Yeah, come and get me

386
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:36,130
I know you're gonna open that door and then you and then all of a sudden you see a proximity mine gets thrown up at you

387
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:49,020
Yeah, come on get the guy that's over here i'm hiding up here with the golden gun and you were just unbeatable

388
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,029
The golden gun killed anybody. Okay. Here we go

389
01:09:54,350 --> 01:10:03,100
Let's have some fun

390
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:09,010
He's so shit-faced. It's so hard to control this. How do I detonate them?

391
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,739
Not like that

392
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:23,420
How do you detonate? I don't know. Isn't it? It's like a different item, isn't it? Yeah, it's this one

393
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:43,470
Isn't there something in one of these I feel like there's something in right here

394
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:54,739
Okay, the whole goal with this is you're supposed to get down here

395
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,000
You have to press a bunch of buttons and shit and then you have to get through and find one of the scientists

396
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:42,500
I don't know. Let's just go. Can we open this? All right, we have to do this quick body armor looks good

397
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:55,310
We made it through here

398
01:11:55,310 --> 01:12:03,090
Why does it explode for 10 seconds? Yeah, the after explosion is huge. All right now this part's important. I remember this

399
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:12,779
You I need I think I need your key card. Oh shit. I'm sorry. How do I um, I need the key card

400
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:22,140
Doesn't he have a key card?

401
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:32,180
Oh the other doctor

402
01:12:32,260 --> 01:13:25,979
That one right there. Huh? Don't you where do you get a key card? You don't need the key card on this difficulty

403
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:49,789
Oh, okay. I'm gonna do this because I feel like it's very necessary. Okay. Now, what do I can I get the key card?

404
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:43,840
Yeah, there's a named character that's in this level somewhere. Where are you guys going? Holy shit. That's a lot of people. Oh

405
01:14:45,199 --> 01:15:06,420
Turn on paintball mode. There's a ton of random cheats you can do

406
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:19,199
I think you have to beat the game on certain difficulties to unlock them though, right? All right

407
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:36,689
I'm gonna save it here boy

408
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:38,689
Um, oh no

409
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:47,060
Keep this out. All right. So there is

410
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:56,020
There's a lot of people here. Ah, where are you? I think one of these guys has something that I need

411
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:01,250
Do you guys have something everybody have a key card?

412
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:36,770
Uh, all right. Well, at least I saved it. No, no, no, no, no

413
01:16:37,010 --> 01:17:02,560
All right, i'm gonna stay right here just for a second. Not you. There we are. Hey, what's up time to leave?

414
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:16,029
Dr. Doak, you'll need the decoder to open the bottling room door. Look good luck. Okay. He just gave it to me

415
01:17:34,369 --> 01:17:42,270
I think there's a cut scene here. I have the save points right there. We'll be fine

416
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,550
Oh my goodness go in the door

417
01:17:54,029 --> 01:18:45,779
Not supposed to kill that guy only you knew if only you knew if only you knew for england games for england

418
01:18:47,439 --> 01:19:02,130
Alec, I almost killed myself getting here. Alec half of everything is luck and the other half pure skill

419
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:54,609
Fate of a fucking secret devil agent. Oh, I have to destroy all those. Do I need the cut scene first?

420
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:35,149
All right, let's go

421
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:57,819
Yeah, I know for england. All right, let's go. Come on for england james. Yes for england

422
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:07,310
Completed are they all just get out of fucking way?

423
01:21:43,939 --> 01:22:13,229
Shit-faced vr honestly. Okay. I'm gonna attack. Should I kill let's save it right here. You fucking idiot. Oh my god

424
01:22:19,649 --> 01:22:26,510
I lose

425
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,750
Can I come over here so I can

426
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,630
Detonate this and not get in trouble don't

427
01:22:33,550 --> 01:23:04,850
I can't help that. He's stupid. I how am I supposed to solve that? I gotta get all of these

428
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:47,279
Dude how do you beat this? I don't remember being that hard you need to get out of the way

429
01:23:54,739 --> 01:23:55,859
two

430
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:58,430
three

431
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:59,470
four

432
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:10,180
eight

433
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,699
Fuck him who cares?

434
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:26,079
Yeah, I did it

435
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,149
All right. That's all I wanted to do. That was fun though

436
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,170
Yeah, that's why we're gonna wrap it up. I just wanted to do a couple of these goofy dumb things

437
01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:56,029
How about f zero? What's that?

438
01:24:58,579 --> 01:25:00,579
F 099 what's f 099?

439
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:10,100
F 099

440
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,300
Is it new?

441
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,470
It's a free thing on the switch

442
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:28,189
I just don't I'll show you. I just don't understand

443
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:36,699
Dad, stop dad. You just start at the beginning. I start at the beginning. I what I son I can't fucking shoot that thing

444
01:25:36,939 --> 01:25:39,659
Why not? That's ridiculous. This game's terrible

445
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:45,619
Dad, if you just didn't shoot at the that's not I don't that thing can't even take damage dad

446
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:50,500
Why not? I should have programmed that in that's why I I don't understand it

447
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,819
Is that what it's like for you guys?

448
01:25:54,819 --> 01:26:09,779
I have a feeling it is that's fun

449
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:17,020
F 099. What do I get it? Hold on. Can I just get it here? Should I do it once? Where do I go?

450
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:38,430
It's just free on the shop. Okay, i'll get it free on the shop. Is it featured or where would it be?

451
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:53,779
Oh, there it is f 099

452
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:56,720
Okay

453
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,750
Yeah, i'll do one lightning fast f 0 racing with 99 players. Wow, that actually seems really fun

454
01:27:03,069 --> 01:27:21,890
Yeah, 100. It's free download. Sure. So this kind of works like imagining pac-man

455
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:25,180
Um 99 and tetris 99

456
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,220
Okay, that's right. It sounds fun

457
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,810
Uh, let me go. Let me go pee one more time

458
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:43,010
I know i'm getting to the end but i'm gonna pee I have to download it anyway, so be right back
