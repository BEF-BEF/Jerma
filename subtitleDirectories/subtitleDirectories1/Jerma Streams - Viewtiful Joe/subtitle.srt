864
03:49:53,059 --> 03:49:59,030
week to take a shower brush your teeth and take a shit a week I'm gonna say it's probably it's

865
03:49:59,030 --> 03:50:05,930
probably like what is about 10 minutes in the shower like five to ten minutes in the shower

866
03:50:06,729 --> 03:50:13,639
two to four minutes to brush your teeth um and then about 15 to 45 minutes depending on

914
04:00:31,610 --> 04:00:41,219
of you subscribed and then and fanning to me on four different websites oh by the way on one of

915
04:00:41,219 --> 04:00:47,860
these websites yeah you're paying you pay like five ten dollars a month and oh maybe I'll do a

916
04:00:47,860 --> 04:00:54,659
Facebook post every uh maybe two or three weeks and then maybe I'll do I'll do a video for like

917
04:00:54,659 --> 04:01:04,579
two minutes going hey what's up my supporters and thanks thanks for thanks for triple dipping

918
04:01:04,579 --> 04:01:22,520
how does he not know what it's not like a patreon what is it how do you have a website called only

919
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:37,340
fans and it's not like a fan's like sign up to make money and interact with your fans that's

920
04:01:37,340 --> 04:01:48,979
what the tagline is this doesn't this is only fans sign up to make money and interact with your fans

921
04:01:48,979 --> 04:01:57,180
how it works look this is just like a person like on camera anyone can earn as far as we're

922
04:01:57,180 --> 04:02:01,100
concerned if you if you use one social media and produce your own content you should be using

923
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:06,540
only fans right whether you're uploading tutorials tips behind the scenes footage or endless selfies

924
04:02:06,540 --> 04:02:19,879
right this that's what this what are you guys talking about number of followers how many

925
04:02:19,879 --> 04:02:26,280
fall okay how many followers do I have let me follow up what I have I have 200 let's just round

926
04:02:26,280 --> 04:02:31,319
it up to 300 000 okay how many number of followers no number follow okay my monthly subscription

927
04:02:31,319 --> 04:02:39,860
price is 15 dollars a month that's fucking outrageous you could earn between 45 000 and

928
04:02:39,860 --> 04:02:54,649
225 000 per month what hold on wait a minute wait you could earn 200 000 a month based on

929
04:02:54,649 --> 04:02:58,969
an estimate between one percent and five percent of your followers subscribing that's not going

930
04:02:58,969 --> 04:03:07,500
to be accurate is this a hold on this is saying that if I have 300 000 followers that between

931
04:03:07,500 --> 04:03:15,700
30 and 40 000 will subscribe that's not accurate it's more like 0.2 or something and it would be

932
04:03:15,780 --> 04:03:21,159
no this is inaccurate it would be like five dollars it would be five dollars a month

933
04:03:21,159 --> 04:03:25,799
and I only have a hundred thousand twitter followers so you would earn between 4900 and

934
04:03:25,799 --> 04:03:39,299
24 000 a month that's a lot of money it's a lot of money oh no when I say only I mean only fans

935
04:03:41,530 --> 04:03:53,430
I didn't say the fans part afterwards only feet it's porn it doesn't look like it from here

936
04:03:53,430 --> 04:04:07,930
it doesn't look like it from here this is the only fans porn videos no there's no porn videos

937
04:04:10,680 --> 04:04:17,799
oh maybe it is only fans has put x-rated entertainment in the hands of the entertainers

938
04:04:17,799 --> 04:04:24,860
the paywall of porn oh yeah but can't you hold on a second but can't you do like if you have a

939
04:04:24,860 --> 04:04:29,819
patreon can't you do like a you do like a is this porn not allowed on patreon could you like porn

940
04:04:29,819 --> 04:04:40,870
patreon patreon porn you do like a point so what's the difference it's not it is it's all

941
04:04:40,870 --> 04:04:50,739
it's allowed oops I just that's a pornhub link I can't I it's not opening right close everything

942
04:04:50,739 --> 04:04:55,030
alt f4 every fucking thing I'll turn the stream off all right that was a pornhub link the first

943
04:04:55,030 --> 04:05:10,340
one so I'm not gonna I clicked it but I immediately x is gonna make it two hundred thousand dollars a

944
04:05:10,340 --> 04:05:21,799
month that's that that's like that's like retire that's retire like that's like retire in six

945
04:05:21,799 --> 04:05:28,329
months money if you're making three hundred thousand dollars a month for like a year

946
04:05:29,739 --> 04:05:41,030
that's literally you're done forever and it's tax free that's horseshit that's there's no uh guys

947
04:05:41,030 --> 04:05:45,690
there's no such thing as tax free okay let me let me just be honest with you

948
04:05:45,690 --> 04:05:53,579
move on I make double that I make four hundred thousand dollars a month

949
04:05:55,739 --> 04:06:00,600
if I made four hundred thousand dollars a month I would have already reached out to

950
04:06:00,600 --> 04:06:04,440
fucking Danny DeVito's agent and he I would have tried he would have streamed in my place

951
04:06:05,829 --> 04:06:10,469
with like a like makeup on to look like me are you fucking serious you really think I wouldn't do

952
04:06:10,469 --> 04:06:16,069
that are you are you kidding me if I made like half a million dollars a month I would make I

953
04:06:16,069 --> 04:06:19,270
would I would hire a hundred clowns just to fucking sit in the room silent with me

954
04:06:20,229 --> 04:06:32,219
like for a week straight and I would never address them you guys I'm dead wait what just

955
04:06:32,219 --> 04:06:52,120
happened what's wrong with me what the hell's going on here did I wait okay I'm gonna hold

956
04:06:52,120 --> 04:06:56,760
you to that when you really really make it big oh what the it's knocking me back into the other

957
04:06:56,760 --> 04:07:08,600
part of the level the stream potential the jerk has plans what else would I do

958
04:07:13,049 --> 04:07:24,040
just okay we're fine what does this want me to do what else would I do I I mean I'm full of

959
04:07:24,040 --> 04:07:31,299
fucking stupid ideas I know that that's like a you hear a lot of them but there's stuff that

960
04:07:31,299 --> 04:07:43,799
I've really always wanted to do but I mean who knows now come down if money was no object what's

961
04:07:43,799 --> 04:07:51,239
the most out there idea well I I really really really really want to do another live action

962
04:07:51,239 --> 04:08:04,120
germa rumble but I want it to be I want it to be like actually live like on twitch and I want a

963
04:08:04,120 --> 04:08:16,500
bunch of crazy shit to happen on that stream I want it live on twitch not like a video come on

964
04:08:16,500 --> 04:08:27,000
I'm trying to fucking make this happen I'm dead oh my god am I dead I'm dead I'm not I'm alive

965
04:08:27,000 --> 04:08:36,420
I'm good I'm alive I really want to see you well here's you want here's something that's

966
04:08:36,420 --> 04:08:44,579
actually kind of funny germa rumble live action 2 is already written already it's already done

967
04:08:44,579 --> 04:08:49,770
it just has to be made that's a secret that I've held on to for a probably a couple of like a year

968
04:08:49,770 --> 04:08:57,379
and a half it's already written the whole thing the whole thing's done everything is there the

969
04:08:57,379 --> 04:09:02,020
only thing that would need to change is some characters that may have been more relevant

970
04:09:02,020 --> 04:09:07,750
like a year and a half ago would have to just be replaced but there's this stuff in there that

971
04:09:07,750 --> 04:09:16,340
hopefully if I ever had like an opportunity what the fuck if I ever had the opportunity

972
04:09:16,340 --> 04:09:30,600
it would be a lot of fun I have it only for fun though well it's not even necessarily

973
04:09:33,030 --> 04:09:44,260
there's there's like other options too and it's not because all right the carnival the carnival

974
04:09:44,260 --> 04:09:48,979
was just like a fun thing to do and something I really really wanted to do and it was it was a

975
04:09:48,979 --> 04:09:54,659
ton of fun I have blast doing it had a ton of fun making it and it was a blast and that was

976
04:09:55,540 --> 04:10:00,819
I paid for the whole thing there was no sponsor there was no outside help it was literally just

977
04:10:00,819 --> 04:10:10,459
I just was like here it's just a bunch of money okay do it if there was someone if like a sponsor

978
04:10:10,459 --> 04:10:14,540
or something and as we've talked about it before the guys that did carnival we've had a lot of

979
04:10:14,540 --> 04:10:22,170
conversations about this if it was possible it maybe that would be an avenue maybe maybe having

980
04:10:22,170 --> 04:10:28,649
somebody that could could pony up a ton more money to do something crazy like that right I

981
04:10:28,649 --> 04:10:33,850
don't have to make five hundred thousand dollars a month to do germa rumble life too the way that I

982
04:10:33,850 --> 04:10:39,850
want it it would just have to make sense and it would have to be something that I that I didn't

983
04:10:41,590 --> 04:10:46,229
I never wanted to get to a point where I take money on this stream for fun just because it's

984
04:10:46,229 --> 04:10:54,540
there like the reason to do a sponsored stream like that would be solely to make it actually

985
04:10:54,540 --> 04:11:08,680
happen it wouldn't be burning really any other reason I gotta go down it's not gonna happen

986
04:11:09,399 --> 04:11:33,129
how do I do this oh it's gonna crush me I can't move I think I do I have the right idea what have

987
04:11:33,129 --> 04:11:37,370
you sold tickets no I would want it to be free I just want I want to be able to people watch it

988
04:11:37,370 --> 04:11:43,049
and not to pay for it and pay per view no that's too much that's too far I don't I wouldn't want

989
04:11:43,049 --> 04:12:13,909
to do that how can I not do this I can jump through that contact yeah this we'll see I think it's

990
04:12:13,909 --> 04:12:20,440
just to see it live would be fine yeah but the thing about venues like that you just have to

991
04:12:20,440 --> 04:12:29,350
remember it it would have to be wherever it was filmed it would have to be you know obviously

992
04:12:29,350 --> 04:12:34,870
protected and safe from anyone just kind of coming in and just hey I'm here I'm on the stream now

993
04:12:35,829 --> 04:12:43,860
so having like a private venue is probably better especially if it's like a scripted event I gotta

994
04:12:43,860 --> 04:12:48,100
make sure the right shit is done right people are involved because if it's just like oh hey guys

995
04:12:48,100 --> 04:12:53,620
by the way we're at this venue welcome everybody to turbo rebel live twitch edition then oh and

996
04:12:53,620 --> 04:12:58,420
there's five cars that just pulled up and there are just people are coming in people are knocking

997
04:12:58,420 --> 04:13:26,819
on the door oh you can punch that guys he can punch that guys he can punch that thing the heck

998
04:13:26,819 --> 04:14:31,590
but that's another thing like funding for a fuck I'm done I said all right I said we'll call it

999
04:14:31,590 --> 04:14:37,139
her I'll see you tomorrow hey 500 dollars dude don't read that out loud because it's outrageous

1000
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:48,860
uh so are we gonna fund this no no no what I was gonna say is I don't want to have a large stream

1001
04:14:48,860 --> 04:14:57,299
be the sole responsibility for you guys to pay for it hey I can't wait to do I'm gonna hype you

1002
04:14:57,299 --> 04:15:04,899
guys up turbo rumble live too I just need a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars guys

1003
04:15:04,899 --> 04:15:13,020
I just need like I need like seventy five thousand dollars everybody come on let's go like I don't

1004
04:15:13,020 --> 04:15:28,020
want to do that we have a number now no that's not even accurate not even accurate because there be

1005
04:15:28,020 --> 04:15:34,120
I would want you know obviously if you can get like a sponsor to cover a majority of that that's a

1006
04:15:34,280 --> 04:15:44,489
big deal it's gonna be more than that maybe the shit that I want to have happen on that stream is

1007
04:15:44,489 --> 04:15:51,399
like that they're gonna have to let's just put it this way it's gonna have to be uh four or five

1008
04:15:51,399 --> 04:16:01,159
different units on set for that so but there's other things that have been worked on just I don't

1009
04:16:01,159 --> 04:16:05,559
I'm not talking about them because why talk about something unless it's ready to go or makes any

1010
04:16:05,559 --> 04:16:23,700
sense or is real what kind of unit well you thought I was gonna do it no but uh yeah well

1011
04:16:23,700 --> 04:16:28,579
we'll call it here did I even explain what the new schedule was before I feel like I started

1012
04:16:28,579 --> 04:16:32,260
halfway and then I just gave up and like somebody called me stupid and I like yelled at them what

1013
04:16:32,260 --> 04:16:41,100
happened did I even explain it to anybody all right so what this channel has been used to has

1014
04:16:41,100 --> 04:16:50,020
been about three days a week for six to eight hours changing it because of my medical problems

1015
04:16:50,979 --> 04:16:55,219
it's better for me to do this in small doses but I'm going to do it more times a week

1016
04:16:56,180 --> 04:16:59,739
so instead of three to four times a week we're going to go four or five times a week

1017
04:17:00,379 --> 04:17:08,149
for about four to five hours a stream that's the plan so the streams will be shorter but they will

1018
04:17:08,149 --> 04:17:13,719
be at least one more day so it'll it'll actually turn out to be probably around the same time

1019
04:17:13,719 --> 04:17:30,059
streamed but just spread out a little more but yeah he has a yes make them shorter but funnier

1020
04:17:30,620 --> 04:17:35,190
I mean I just I don't have an I don't know how you can't how you do that

1021
04:17:38,600 --> 04:17:39,799
shorter but funnier

1022
04:17:45,079 --> 04:17:51,559
is that even I don't know how do I even how just be you have to be funny all right

1023
04:17:52,200 --> 04:18:00,200
I contrary to think popular belief here there is no plan when I turn a stream guys I'm not just

1024
04:18:00,200 --> 04:18:06,149
like okay I've got these 200 jokes ready I've got they're all lined up in front of me on

1025
04:18:06,149 --> 04:18:11,399
six pieces of paper I'm gonna go bullet to bullet it's kind of just kind of shit just

1026
04:18:11,399 --> 04:18:25,819
kind of happens show the joke list you have to break a leg use the sneeze macro it's gone

1027
04:18:25,819 --> 04:18:31,979
this thing had to be unplugged and like I did deleted shit leak the joke list

1028
04:18:33,420 --> 04:18:40,020
maybe I should start writing stuff down well I do have a lot of stuff written down would you

1029
04:18:40,020 --> 04:18:43,459
like to see would you like to hear what some of the ideas are written down they're gonna happen

1030
04:18:43,459 --> 04:18:50,709
in the next probably month or so I'll read them to you streams here we go I'll read a couple to

1031
04:18:50,709 --> 04:18:59,450
you let's see if I remember what any of these are green screen DLC obviously that's still

1032
04:18:59,450 --> 04:19:07,780
going to happen the iPad stream the iPad stream that's somebody had this this interesting concept

1033
04:19:07,780 --> 04:19:14,260
where you go to like YouTube on the iPad and click on every ad that's for a video game downloaded

1034
04:19:14,260 --> 04:19:19,979
and play it for 20 minutes and just do that continue to do it I'm gonna need a fucking new

1035
04:19:19,979 --> 04:19:31,139
iPad after that but you know that was one of the things to do like all those just mobile game ads

1036
04:19:31,139 --> 04:19:35,540
click of and download them but then I'm gonna get like tracked for life so that one hasn't happened

1037
04:19:35,540 --> 04:19:42,659
yet the easy bake oven stream is still on the on the plants here just have to buy a few more

1038
04:19:42,659 --> 04:19:48,500
things for it but that's gonna happen sooner rather than later oh another one that's gonna

1039
04:19:48,500 --> 04:19:59,579
happen soon you I was gonna get a bunch of those old kids board games like slobber and Sam

1040
04:20:00,379 --> 04:20:06,059
and like mousetrap and just get like a two dozen of them and just try to play them and like over

1041
04:20:06,059 --> 04:20:10,920
like a two stream period I was thinking about maybe even seeing if other like people might

1042
04:20:10,920 --> 04:20:14,280
want to do that get like four or five people to try to play these stupid shitty games from like

1043
04:20:14,280 --> 04:20:21,079
1995 that's another one that's coming up probably what else we got all right we got mad world for

1044
04:20:21,079 --> 04:20:32,409
the week that's written here for some reason that's here uh monster lab for the week we can

1049
04:21:02,459 --> 04:21:08,340
played that one oh mu gun mu gun insanity right and this is bringing back some some more ideas

1050
04:21:08,340 --> 04:21:15,340
i was going to download every single fucking character in mu gun every single one and uh play

1051
04:21:16,420 --> 04:21:24,219
and try to play through it like just pick random character and play and see how far i can get with

1052
04:21:24,219 --> 04:21:37,020
each character that's probably a terabyte of space that's a hundred terabytes are you serious

1053
04:21:38,170 --> 04:21:43,930
some characters have viruses but what if i just get another computer like can i use like an old

1054
04:21:43,930 --> 04:21:49,770
laptop or something or an old like desktop and just get a one like two terabyte drive and that's

1055
04:21:49,770 --> 04:21:58,649
just the mu gun computer and like even if it gets a bunch of viruses who cares that's money no i'm

1056
04:21:58,649 --> 04:22:03,209
talking about my like an old computer i'm not gonna go buy i'm not gonna go buy a computer to

1057
04:22:03,209 --> 04:22:09,379
break it with mu gun viruses what it would be a mu gun computer and i would just pull the video

1058
04:22:09,379 --> 04:22:16,069
through feed through the i said the thing about malgato being the worst thing ever right fuck i

1059
04:22:16,069 --> 04:22:21,030

1060
04:22:21,030 --> 04:22:34,420
buy and that's like not even true it's an 100 that's 100 terabytes how many characters are

1061
04:22:34,420 --> 04:22:49,559
every character in mugen like 50 000 how many characters are in mugen there's more than 50 000

1140
04:36:46,340 --> 04:36:52,180
question for you guys so when you touch a light bulb and you go fuck that's hot how hot is that

1141
04:36:52,180 --> 04:36:57,060
what degrees what what at what degree are you like whoa that's fucking hot like your light bulb

1143
04:37:06,419 --> 04:37:13,900
gonna get 175 degrees hotter than the whoa that's hot okay i'm afraid to put i'm afraid to use this

1144
04:37:13,900 --> 04:37:20,490
in my room i'm gonna like i'm gonna do the stream like in the garage i'm gonna go to i'm gonna do

1145
04:37:20,490 --> 04:37:26,889
like a garage stream that's gonna be creepy as fuck by the way what a creepy fucking stream

1146
04:37:27,529 --> 04:37:43,779
i'm doing an easy bake oven stream in a garage that's terrifying let's have bugleberry do it

1147
04:37:43,779 --> 04:37:50,259
no that's you know how hot bugleberry gets do you understand that how hot bugleberry gets

1148
04:37:50,259 --> 04:37:56,419
in his skin how hot bugleberry's skin is when he's sitting there with the trench coat on and his big

1149
04:37:56,419 --> 04:38:02,619
fucking face you know how hot it is in that trench coat probably pretty hot i would say if i was

1150
04:38:02,619 --> 04:38:14,099
bugleberry and i was sitting there for like 20 straight minutes in if i was him i haven't used

1151
04:38:14,099 --> 04:38:21,689
light bulbs for easy bake ovens in literally decades so what is in there i'm gonna be like

1152
04:38:21,689 --> 04:38:31,220
wicked safety about this i'm gonna be so safe with this you have no idea because it's not just easy

1153
04:38:31,220 --> 04:38:38,040
bake oven easy bake oven is probably the main event of that stream i would say i'm gonna get

1154
04:38:38,040 --> 04:38:44,340
a bunch of those little like kits those little uh like cooking kits like remember the thing i

1155
04:38:44,340 --> 04:38:55,669
tweeted out i'm gonna get like three or four maybe five six of those and do them blend no it's a

1156
04:38:55,669 --> 04:39:02,819
fucking toaster yeah but i would don't be like scared of a toaster i don't know anything that

1157
04:39:02,819 --> 04:39:07,860
generates heat it just kind of yeah for some reason it freaks me out i know it's like safe and

1158
04:39:07,860 --> 04:39:15,779
shit but even a toaster it's like this is this is little it's a little these wires in there and they

1159
04:39:15,779 --> 04:39:20,819
just get to be like six fucking million degrees just so concentrated concentrated fucking heat

1160
04:39:20,819 --> 04:39:24,659
and i just like i don't even know i want to cook i wish like i wish i could cook with the sun

1161
04:39:25,860 --> 04:39:30,340
if i could cook with the sun i'd be that'd be great if there was like in everybody's backyard just one

1162
04:39:30,340 --> 04:39:36,790
beam of fucking insanely hot like 400 degree heat light that was just in your backyard oh you just

1163
04:39:36,790 --> 04:39:39,990
like put like a hamburger fucking out there and like underneath the light it was like

1164
04:39:41,029 --> 04:39:54,860
you flipped it you live in vegas you can do that not until august the sun is way hotter all right

1165
04:39:55,500 --> 04:39:58,939
when you go like this i know we're supposed to be ending the stream but i have i have questions

1166
04:39:59,659 --> 04:40:07,900
when you like a line like this and it's 120 like 115 degrees outside how hot it's 115 degrees

1167
04:40:08,779 --> 04:40:20,790
it's gonna say how hot is the sun on your face it's 115 degrees that's how hard it is outside

1168
04:40:20,790 --> 04:40:28,709
that's how hard it is i don't know why i thought that like it was like a chemical reaction on your

1169
04:40:28,709 --> 04:40:33,349
face i don't know why i'm thinking that when the sun that's 115 like is hitting your face there's

1170
04:40:33,349 --> 04:40:42,709
like a chemical reaction that goes up to like 180 you'd fucking melt your skin would be peeling

1171
04:40:42,709 --> 04:40:50,979
up humidity that's what i'm doing everybody hold on a second humidity right if if it's like

1172
04:40:51,779 --> 04:41:03,720
if it's like 75 humidity then it'd be 115 that it would go up to like 130 how hot is hot

1173
04:41:03,720 --> 04:41:08,810
if it's humid it's nice no it's not absolutely horrible thing i just heard somebody say

1174
04:41:08,889 --> 04:41:17,849
humanity is the worst thing in the world it just is i would i'm such a lizard fuck i dry just dry

1196
04:45:04,389 --> 04:45:09,180
like a blinky person another reason why i don't have the webcam on all the time because i usually

1204
04:46:07,340 --> 04:46:23,590
he's mad mad enough to eat a fucking battery on stream no i don't want to put that that scares me

1205
04:46:23,590 --> 04:46:29,590
because can you like touch if you okay this is the plus and minus if i like touch my tongue to the

1206
04:46:29,590 --> 04:46:33,270
plus and like this is like a current on the my i like it i'll just shock my mouth i'm not gonna

1207
04:46:33,270 --> 04:46:36,869
do that that's a fucking terrible idea that's a mistake you could actually get you could actually

1208
04:46:36,869 --> 04:46:43,099
get hurt by that all right what's more dangerous putting a battery in your mouth

1209
04:46:43,099 --> 04:46:46,939
or operating an easy bake oven the way that it's supposed to be by the manual

1210
04:46:54,580 --> 04:46:59,139
like if i went like this and stuck my tongue on the battery is that more dangerous than operating

1211
04:46:59,139 --> 04:47:03,860
the easy bake oven with with with parent adult supervision the way that it's intended to what's

1212
04:47:03,860 --> 04:47:27,020
more dangerous where does iq go i have 124 iq by the way 60 performance iq but like 100 visual and

1213
04:47:27,020 --> 04:47:36,700
then like 80 linguistical that's actually real i did a real like four hour long iq test when i

1214
04:47:36,700 --> 04:47:41,180
was like 17 or 16 i did it again when i was 20 because i wanted to find out what was wrong with

1215
04:47:41,180 --> 04:47:46,619
me and it turned out i was really fucking smart but i was really stupid at doing things correctly

1216
04:47:46,619 --> 04:48:03,400
there you go it was on facebook no oh yeah click here five minute 10 questions yeah those are just

1217
04:48:03,400 --> 04:48:11,479
ways to find out how you lean politically by the way guys oh question number three solve this uh

1218
04:48:11,479 --> 04:48:17,080
solve this cube this cube you have to move some pieces around uh thanks for clicking on our iq

1219
04:48:17,080 --> 04:48:23,720
test nice nice okay next so it's over here it's over here is joe biden and then bernie sanders

1220
04:48:23,720 --> 04:48:30,520
is over here uh which one of these two would you would you say you lean more towards uh this one

1221
04:48:30,680 --> 04:48:39,220
okay okay so question six is um solve for x that's all they care about they don't the questions

1222
04:48:39,220 --> 04:48:44,819
one two three five six seven eight nine ten are fucking meaningless they just want question three

1223
04:48:44,819 --> 04:49:09,259
answered and you'll do it remind us collecting data he actually took a facebook iq test i think

1224
04:49:09,259 --> 04:49:20,090
i did it on this stream like two months ago the stream is never ending i'm just chilling

1225
04:49:20,409 --> 04:49:33,740
sometimes i just hang out those years ago no that was when i was in vegas for our adhd exam stream

1226
04:49:34,540 --> 04:49:38,939
i couldn't it's it's it's not even embarrassing me selling telling you this because

1227
04:49:39,580 --> 04:49:43,340
hold on i'm not done i said my streams are gonna be like four to five hours we're

1228
04:49:43,340 --> 04:49:49,900
almost five which is this is like a hangout session um if i took a like a high school test

1229
04:49:49,900 --> 04:49:57,580
right now like a real one an actual high school test geography math science social studies

1230
04:49:57,580 --> 04:50:04,970
whatever history i felt i would i'm gonna be realistic very realistic i'd get probably

1231
04:50:04,970 --> 04:50:11,209
between five and ten points on the test without question i would not get more than ten points

1232
04:50:15,180 --> 04:50:31,029
stand up and pace why stand up and pace and talk to you oh yeah because i can move around

1233
04:50:34,259 --> 04:50:43,000
okay so i mean if i took that test right now if i was in your classroom this is weird to me

1234
04:50:43,959 --> 04:50:58,009
i don't i don't like this i hate this i need a microphone right here if i don't have a

1235
04:50:58,009 --> 04:51:01,770
microphone right here then i'm just like i'm just like a guy in a room like walking around like no

1236
04:51:01,770 --> 04:51:10,040
vr headset or anything i'm just standing around and talking so if you gave me a test right now

1237
04:51:10,040 --> 04:51:15,400
and it was a high school test and by the way why why do i always just not look at anybody

1238
04:51:16,040 --> 04:51:22,220
right if there's a whole audience here i'm never looking at anyone in the audience literally ever

1239
04:51:22,220 --> 04:51:25,979
i'm looking at the exit signs that's a tip by the way for those of you public speakers that want some

1240
04:51:25,979 --> 04:51:31,180
public speaking tips just look at the exit signs back and forth that's how you do it so what you

1241
04:51:31,180 --> 04:51:34,220
do is you go like this there's an exit sign over there i'm going to talk at that exit sign and i'm

1242
04:51:34,220 --> 04:51:37,979
going to move our eyes over here and talk to this exit sign over here i'm going to make a couple of

1243
04:51:37,979 --> 04:51:43,340
points over on this exit sign and then somebody's gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna lock i'm gonna lock

1244
04:51:43,340 --> 04:51:48,220
fucking eye contact with somebody randomly in the audience and it's gonna freak the both of us out

1245
04:51:48,220 --> 04:51:53,419
for a split fucking second it's gonna go something like this so if you gave me a test in high school

1246
04:51:53,419 --> 04:52:00,299
and you said jeremy jeremy if you gave me a test in high school you said jeremy find me

1247
04:52:02,009 --> 04:52:08,580
software software why i'm not sure i'd be able to do it and there's a reason why the reason is

1248
04:52:09,220 --> 04:52:15,700

1277
04:57:04,860 --> 04:57:12,340
through star making that video because we used to hang out in calls every single day and i got the

1278
04:57:12,340 --> 04:57:21,930
whole rundown pretty much every level he was everything he did it was a different game oh

1279
04:57:22,740 --> 04:57:25,860
that's not the same game jackie chan adventures what was the one that star played

1280
04:57:33,669 --> 04:57:39,900
what was the stunt master oh i didn't know there was more than one jackie chan game for

1284
04:57:59,939 --> 04:58:03,299

1285

we'll figure that out tomorrow thank you jason for the 250 you incited us that the game was so

1291
04:58:48,330 --> 04:58:54,099
hype only to give us a seizure on the start screen this game gets a minus two out of plus two well

1292
04:58:54,099 --> 04:58:59,639
there's only two ratings there and by the way minus two and plus two are not ratings for video

1293
04:58:59,639 --> 04:59:05,479
games there did you think the last thing said was funny and you're not using the rating system

1294
04:59:05,479 --> 04:59:11,529
correctly i think a lot of you have not been using the rating system correctly for a little

1295
04:59:11,529 --> 04:59:24,580
while now no it's for right and for yes okay whole of one zombie thanks to 250 when you're

1299
04:59:43,979 --> 04:59:48,580

04:59:48,580 --> 04:59:56,740
there's no reason to order anything else from there but that's just me uh when am i gonna go

1315
05:01:39,299 --> 05:01:45,080
if that's the case then i kind of already like i said have i curiously lived through it

1316
05:01:46,040 --> 05:01:49,000
that's by the way that's one of the best videos on youtube if you're curious

1317
05:01:49,880 --> 05:02:09,020
that's like one of the best video gaming related videos on youtube thanks to the 250 dude what

1318
05:02:09,020 --> 05:02:18,229

drew crew is back no they are not no they're not they are not no there we go all right i got it

1322
05:03:02,310 --> 05:03:11,110
uh we had 250 from yen wen president artist and they say uh i was thinking of recommending a game

1323
05:03:11,110 --> 05:03:27,830
that's by the same video i was thinking about recommending a game by the same developers as

1324
05:03:27,830 --> 05:03:38,200
beautiful joe clover studios which was founded by capcom however the game is around 30 plus hours

1325
05:03:38,200 --> 05:03:45,049
i'm about 34 hours into my play through him at the last level the game is okami i've actually

1326
05:03:45,049 --> 05:03:52,729
experienced okami before a great game the painting paintbrush the dog i think that's correct i think

1327
05:03:52,729 --> 05:03:56,169
that's the right game because you're a little you're a dog right you have a paintbrush you paint

1328
05:03:56,169 --> 05:04:05,500
with the paint for the wiimote yeah that's great it's a great game when you have a germa 985 video

1329
05:04:05,500 --> 05:04:12,700
about it i don't think i made a video on okami but i have played it so i probably wouldn't stream

1330
05:04:12,700 --> 05:04:17,900
it but it is fantastic it's a classic and then they didn't they remade it they remastered it

1331
05:04:17,900 --> 05:04:29,799
once or twice right he's played it get out of it but thanks for the recommendation yen wen

1332
05:04:29,799 --> 05:04:36,580
it's a great game hey drax von tour thanks for the 500 bits germa my brothers and i have loved

1336
05:04:51,380 --> 05:04:54,659
on the wii u because it was one of the only games on the wii u that were worth buying

1337
05:04:55,540 --> 05:05:04,569
now there's probably four uh and that was one of them i have played it and it's very good i'm glad

1338
05:05:04,569 --> 05:05:15,110
they're actually gonna put it somewhere else but thanks again it's time for slime what's going on

1339
05:05:15,110 --> 05:05:20,709
time for slime thanks for the thousand bits 10 bucks you should filter out all caps chat messages

1340
05:05:20,709 --> 05:05:28,779
for a day just as an experiment see how much it throws off chat or to go another step further

1341
05:05:28,779 --> 05:05:34,939
uh shadow ban people that write paragraphs in all caps but here's the sad part about doing

1342
05:05:34,939 --> 05:05:43,659
something like that is we remove we then remove a person like the beautiful joe go brr thing

1343
05:05:44,220 --> 05:05:47,819
that was all caps that person was just fucking that person just that person was just thinking

1344
05:05:47,819 --> 05:05:51,259
they were gonna get banned you know what i mean they they probably was just like you know i'm

1345
05:05:51,259 --> 05:05:57,459
probably gonna get like timed out for this did they i'm not even sure they did like that was a

1346
05:05:57,459 --> 05:06:07,979
fucking paragraph in caps does everybody like have that message where is it what was the exact

1347
05:06:07,979 --> 05:06:23,689
message that is now in all caps mode if you ban me it was long it was super long and i it was just

1348
05:06:28,380 --> 05:06:32,459
i don't think anybody can i don't think it's like an elusive beast i don't think anybody has it

1349
05:06:32,459 --> 05:06:46,250
i don't think anybody has it but yeah maybe sometime we'll try it maybe one day for fun

05:08:20,330 --> 05:08:26,900
in club penguin i can't believe that service is still on silent serenity thanks for the 250

1363
05:08:26,900 --> 05:08:31,540
asking chat what game they want to watch seems like asking 5 000 toddlers what they want for

1364
05:08:31,540 --> 05:08:38,180
lunch the only way to win is to give them the streamer equivalent to mcdonald's aka play family

1365
05:08:38,180 --> 05:08:52,040
feud why is it so true it's such a what that's such a true statement drew crew played jojo

1366
05:08:52,759 --> 05:08:58,090
beautiful joe sucked out like i don't like burger king all right fine we're gonna go to mcdonald's

1367
05:08:58,650 --> 05:09:02,569
yeah yeah everyone that's so happy everyone gets so happy when you say that

1368
05:09:08,939 --> 05:09:13,659
i think that's also like obviously we're making them we fuck around a lot on these streams

1369
05:09:13,659 --> 05:09:21,560
but i think the nature of playing a different game almost every single day this stream never

1370
05:09:21,560 --> 05:09:26,119
sees the same game like there's not like a game that it's like oh i play that we're gonna go to

1371
05:09:26,119 --> 05:09:31,000
mcdonald's there is no mcdonald's on this stream there really kind of isn't because there's a new

1372
05:09:31,000 --> 05:09:37,479
game every two or three streams at least so we kind of just try different restaurants every

1373
05:09:37,479 --> 05:09:41,610
single day and some people don't like those restaurants some people want me to go to another

1374
05:09:41,610 --> 05:09:45,770
restaurant some people want me to go back to a restaurant that they really like that they love

1375
05:09:45,770 --> 05:09:57,610
eating at and i love that restaurant too i think that's part of the reason why there's a lot of

1376
05:09:57,610 --> 05:10:06,090
requests you're the guy for the area of streaming i take two bites of the burger and then i leave

1377
05:10:06,090 --> 05:10:12,330
and i go oh that was that's killer oh out of the park man oh you nailed it you nailed it and then

1378
05:10:12,330 --> 05:10:18,380
we play another one the next day and in the background and in the background you just

1379
05:10:26,200 --> 05:10:26,439
or

1380
05:10:33,080 --> 05:10:38,439
there's two different songs there's oh there's only two songs only two on any episode of

1381
05:10:38,439 --> 05:10:45,380
dinos drives and dives there's the i'm gonna give you a list of stuff that this restaurant does

1382
05:10:45,380 --> 05:10:49,560
i'm gonna give you and it's gonna guy get a guy's gonna be like this he's gonna have a plate and

1383
05:10:49,560 --> 05:10:53,880
he's gonna just like throw the plate into the camera it's gonna go ding ding ding ding ding ding

1384
05:10:53,880 --> 05:10:58,360

1450
05:20:14,040 --> 05:20:28,490
thanks ollie clap shit movie you're doing a great job a great job that's one of the best

1451
05:20:28,490 --> 05:20:33,130
that's okay that's if that's the second best video on youtube no that's the best video on youtube

1452
05:20:34,299 --> 05:20:43,099
i'm gonna just stamp that right now and it's not even a video that's how good it is

1453
05:20:43,979 --> 05:20:49,799
that shit's not even a video it's audio only it's the best video on youtube hey vertical giant

1454
05:20:49,799 --> 05:20:54,680
thanks for the 500 bits i was curious about the mugen stream so i checked the character archive

1455
05:20:55,319 --> 05:21:03,220
and there are about 71 500 characters most of them are around 10 to 100 megabytes

1456
05:21:03,220 --> 05:21:07,619
so assuming they average around 50 megabytes downloading every character would take about

1457
05:21:07,619 --> 05:21:20,709
3.57 terabytes jesus 71 fucking thousand characters how what does the character's

1458
05:21:20,709 --> 05:21:30,709
select screen look like it's just a bunch of dots it's not even possible that's almost but

1459
05:21:30,709 --> 05:21:42,099
oh i'm gonna do it there's a hundred pages of characters holy shit is that can you even

1460
05:21:42,099 --> 05:21:54,630
play the game like that you just screen for porn oh i will don't worry you're gonna fucking brick

1461
05:21:54,630 --> 05:22:01,110
a pc well hopefully it's an old one that doesn't matter one that i haven't really cared about in

1462
05:22:01,110 --> 05:22:08,229
probably five plus years i'm just gonna have to put a hard drive in it a few of them can you buy

1463
05:22:09,189 --> 05:22:15,830
okay what those not an ssd because a five terabyte ssd would be like 2000 fucking dollars

1464
05:22:16,790 --> 05:22:26,060
a five or 10 terabyte hard disk drive would be you can still get this for pretty cheap right

1465
05:22:26,779 --> 05:22:36,790
yeah like a 10 terabyte s uh hdd would be probably a couple hundred bucks hundred bucks

1466
05:22:37,669 --> 05:22:44,419
okay that's much better than like two or three thousand all right i'm gonna have my mugen drive

1467
05:22:44,419 --> 05:22:54,759
drive i see everybody doing a link here the whole chat is purple so i'm gonna just i'm gonna

1468
05:22:54,759 --> 05:23:29,860
screen it see what it is this is a six second video this is called crew crew take a look it's

1469
05:23:29,860 --> 05:24:04,250
off six seconds long check it out it's the true crew why does it take me so long to pull something

1470
05:24:04,250 --> 05:24:10,889
up uh because i don't have browser capture on by default because every because every time there are

1471
05:24:10,889 --> 05:24:15,849
links that like spammed in the chat and i like have to close them and look when i when i become

1472
05:24:15,849 --> 05:24:23,529
a professional streamer i'm gonna have a completely separate cap device that just pulls a a browser

1473
05:24:23,529 --> 05:24:27,849
window and it's gonna feed into the stream just i've got a i've got to grow up as a streamer a

1474
05:24:27,849 --> 05:24:34,700
little bit and sometimes it takes me a little while okay once i upgrade from a 1080 uh

1475
05:24:35,340 --> 05:24:40,490
graphics card is when i'll start having that easier and plus i don't like i don't want to

1476
05:24:40,490 --> 05:24:45,819
click on random shit just open it it takes me a few a few moments to make sure it's i have this

1477
05:24:45,819 --> 05:24:51,099
is a legal thing to show on stream because i know i've heard of streamers in the past they just open

1478
05:24:51,099 --> 05:24:56,060
up fucking every link that they see or they get sent to and then there's like a dick on screen

1479
05:24:56,060 --> 05:24:59,659
and then there's like uh something horrible or something bad and then they close the window

1480
05:24:59,659 --> 05:25:02,380
real quick and then they get uh yelled at or they get in trouble they get banned

1481
05:25:04,330 --> 05:25:15,180
you know that's possible uh hey thanks for the true crew uh we're gonna go to the end screen

1622
05:45:44,779 --> 05:45:56,659
shooting at me fuck god i don't even want to watch this every other video game that they've

1623
05:45:56,659 --> 05:46:01,299
ever made in the last like seven years has been the worst game i've ever seen last like seven what

1624
05:46:01,299 --> 05:46:09,740
what every other video what am i talking about true i mean like the quality model warfare was

1625
05:46:09,740 --> 05:46:14,540
good it was all right you know black ops is kind of fun every other video game that they've ever

1626
05:46:14,540 --> 05:46:19,099
made in the last like seven years has been the worst game i've ever seen he's backtracking

1627
05:46:19,740 --> 05:46:23,419
look you have to backtrack because somebody gets really angry look if you don't don't you

1628
05:46:23,419 --> 05:46:27,900
know understand like politics and social interaction 101 if you say something that

1629
05:46:27,900 --> 05:46:33,340
you know is going to really piss off a ton of people backtrace it reiterate and say it's my

1630
05:46:33,340 --> 05:46:39,500
opinion but it's not there were some good things that came from that series backtrack backtrace it

1631
05:46:41,270 --> 05:46:48,169
and then put some passive tracing i don't know whatever backtrack that's the

1632
05:46:48,169 --> 05:46:59,349
origination of backtrack where is this crack part i don't care got it but you can be smoking

1633
05:46:59,430 --> 05:47:03,590
crack in your car and i do what they don't give a shit if you're saying an illegal meme though

1634
05:47:03,590 --> 05:47:07,110
you're gonna get pulled over they'll pull you over they'll check your phone they'll they'll make

1635
05:47:07,110 --> 05:47:10,470
they'll check what your browser history to see that they see what like the things you've been

1636
05:47:10,470 --> 05:47:15,349
saying in chat rooms and stuff you could have like a pound of crack in your trunk or literally you

1637
05:47:15,349 --> 05:47:22,009
could be smoking crack in front of the meme officer and he's not his jurisdiction i have no

1638
05:47:22,009 --> 05:47:27,700
idea what that even means but i guess we found it hey anyways let's finish up the stream ending

1639
05:47:27,700 --> 05:47:33,619
here sometimes i feel like another person said this stuff you know what i mean like

1640
05:47:34,580 --> 05:47:37,700
we've talked about we've talked about this before we've talked about this before

1641
05:47:38,340 --> 05:47:42,259
we've talked about this before we've talked about this before we've gone over this before

1642
05:47:43,299 --> 05:47:46,580
we've gone over this before we've gone over this before i've talked about this before we said this

1643
05:47:46,580 --> 05:47:52,970
before i've talked about this before but uh i say a lot of i talk a lot on these streams and it's

1644
05:47:52,970 --> 05:48:02,900
weird to hear a person that i don't even know who that is talking it's weird to hear like a point i

1645
05:48:02,900 --> 05:48:11,419
was trying to make like three years ago i'm like who the fuck is this person anyways hey

1646
05:48:13,020 --> 05:48:18,700
thanks for the 500 bits mf doom is to the rap game as germa is to the internet that's

1647
05:48:19,740 --> 05:48:23,500
you have a wide meme reach but it still feels like for some reason you're the internet's biggest

1648
05:48:23,500 --> 05:48:28,459
inside joke in a very good way something i've observed deserve more clout for the effort you

1649
05:48:28,540 --> 05:48:41,060
put into your content um i don't know i feel like it i don't even i know it's like really this is

1650
05:48:41,060 --> 05:48:45,299
cliche for me to say this and i know it's i'm gonna say it and people are gonna be like i'm

1651
05:48:45,299 --> 05:48:50,580
gonna hear your eyes roll into the back of your fucking head you're gonna hit the back of your

1652
05:48:50,580 --> 05:48:58,020
brain when i say this and i know it but i don't i really like don't care about being famous i just
