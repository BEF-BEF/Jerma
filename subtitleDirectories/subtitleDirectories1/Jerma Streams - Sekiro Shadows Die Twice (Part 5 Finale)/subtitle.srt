1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,940
Yeah, it was exactly on time. To the second. Right in the window, I'm telling you. I'm not

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:18,820
going to miss the window. My desk! This controller is so dirty. I want to kind of show this to you

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,989
guys. This is the controller I've been using the whole time. This is embarrassing though. I'm not

4
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:36,020
sure I wanted you to see this. This is disgusting. For some reason, I feel like this is going to

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,820
break terms of service. I feel like this is going to break terms of service. It's so gross.

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:56,179
This is the gamepad equivalent of showing like my asshole on stream. I need to clean this. This is

7
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:04,500
the problem. This is dirty key bindings. Dirty keys. Dirty buttons. This is filthy. This is the

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:16,120
reason why I couldn't beat the fucking guy last night. I don't have any alcohol wipes. No. I'm

9
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:27,000
going to furiously clean this at some point. But we're going to tonight try our our very hardest

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,629
then relax and try to get to the end of Sekiro tonight. I'm going to try as hard as I can.

11
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:41,659
I'm going to try to be laser lightning focused. Don't get mad this stream. That's well that's

12
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:58,090
asking a lot. Here comes rage. I haven't been raging. All right. I've been upset. There's a

13
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:19,580
difference. Yes you have. No I have not. There's a difference between agitated and rage. What about

14
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,620
the headless? Well that was that was another. I was going to a different dimension. That's not

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,669
anger. My soul got ripped out of my body and got put in a parallel universe. How am I supposed to

16
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:37,000
be mad at that? It just kind of was happening. Hysterical is a good way to put it. Yeah.

17
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,939
Jerma you've outpaced me so much. I haven't been able to even get to fountainhead palace yet.

18
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:56,180
Stop being good. No I'm just do it. Do it at your own pace. There's no there's no correct way.

19
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,969
Don't let anybody tell you. Don't let any like elitist video gamer tell you

20
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,289
that you're doing it wrong. You got to go faster. No do it at your own pace.

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,939
Don't have somebody go over your shoulder and go hey man you should be like you should have

22
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:28,789
killed that thing already. It's just a fly. Don't listen to them. This is a game that's meant to be

23
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:43,259
taken slow and seriously. Like for instance this guy beats Owl and Genichiro first try but dies

24
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,729
too headless and then they laughed three times. That's three separate laughs. That's all right

25
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:59,939
though. Skip everything. We spent a significant portion of last night's stream making sure that I

26
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:11,000
saw all the things that the game had to offer. I went back yesterday. I skipped. We went back for

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,779
like six hours to like do optional content. Oh you guys are just giving it to me right now.

28
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,939
And just wait till I get even angrier in about 30. I'm gonna I'm not gonna get angry today. I'm

29
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:30,230
gonna be positive today. We're just gonna talk about how positive everything is. It's gonna be

30
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,189
fantastic even if I die. Even if I look over here and I see people like making fun of me.

31
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:42,970
Which that's not very nice okay. It's not very nice when I see die to tutorial boss. I'm trying.

32
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:53,459
That's not a nice thing to see. I'm just kidding. Anyways let's uh let's go.

33
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:06,519
Moral of the story is you're not supposed to beat the game first try. You're supposed to persevere

34
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:14,420
and get ready and I already don't want to do this. I tried to talk myself up so much before the stream

35
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,100
started. I just already don't want to be here but we're gonna go. Here we go. Just I'm not

36
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,860
gonna stop anybody. By the way spoilers. This is a very very late game optional hard boss. If you

37
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:40,949
don't know what that is then I would look away. Why does it feel louder? Is it louder than anybody

38
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:54,389
else? It's really loud. Why? I didn't change anything. Oh it wasn't it wasn't even turned on.

39
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:04,620
Sorry about that. It's it is louder though. It is. It actually is louder.

40
00:06:08,699 --> 00:07:04,420
Here we go. Not good. That was just like dust. Come here dog.

41
00:07:05,220 --> 00:08:22,389
Watch that foot. Watch that foot. Okay fine fine fine fine. Watch out for the blast. Watch out

42
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:30,490
for the blast. Blast incoming. You guys never listened to me. I told you the blast was incoming.

43
00:08:30,490 --> 00:09:06,860
All right shut up here. Not today. That's the best attempt I've ever had. Here we go. He's got the

44
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:16,620
he's got a new move right? I gotta I gotta jump. This is the one right? Does he do it now? I wonder.

45
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:53,740
Yep. Fuck. No I gotta go earlier than that. Go way earlier than that. There it goes. Right? Okay

46
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,100
let's see. One. Two. Is it just a good throw? Whoa that's new. I haven't seen him do that.

47
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:12,169
How long does that last for? Damn okay. That's the first time I've ever seen him do it.

48
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:30,179
He's gotta get out of the corner here. Get out of the corner. Come on.

49
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:37,370
This is such a bad spot. That's just not fair. He just stopped in the corner.

50
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,379
Like seriously I don't I like get out of the fucking corner.

51
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:02,700
He just stood there standing on the wall where the cliff is and here's the worst part about this.

52
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:10,759
If you get any distance at all with this motherfucker you're dead. So standing behind him

53
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:19,419
I'm just gonna go off the cliff. That was a really good first attempt until

54
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:50,330
I ran into the bullshit. He's already at an eight. Oh come on. What the hell was that?

55
00:11:51,289 --> 00:12:54,009
Oh that didn't do that in a while. That just healed me. I didn't press that.

56
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,179
All right I hope you don't stand at the edge of a cliff for two minutes.

57
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:09,289
All right let's see if I can get this. I gotta go even earlier than that I think.

58
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:52,840
Side. Let's see. He like winds up. No you can't just run. I thought you could maybe I would

59
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:31,019
run it but it tracks you the whole time. Dirty control. Is it really the dirt?

60
00:15:31,740 --> 00:16:06,759
Calm down Jeremy. I'm gonna get distance on me. All right here we go. Is he gonna do it?

61
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:53,299
Phase three. Let's see it for the first time ever. Ever. Let's go. Phase three. Come on.

62
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:56,580
What is he doing? Phase three. Oh fuck.

63
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:17,619
Oh he did. He did. It's a. It's a. Whoa. It's a jump rope. I don't know. I guess.

64
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:32,039
Oh shit. I have such trouble with this. Wow it's a sweep. That was different the last time.

65
00:17:35,559 --> 00:18:27,430
That's also different. No. No. Get up. Get up. Get up. I'm gonna take it. What the fuck dude.

66
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:54,619
What the. I don't know what he's doing. No. No. God. What the fuck. Oh my god.

67
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,869
There was a flame wall in front of me. I couldn't even go towards him.

68
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,740
The whistle didn't work. Maybe it was too close for me to be able to use it.

69
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:27,779
Man. Hold on. I need a second. Fuck. I'm so like. I'm so. Nervous up right now. Damn.

70
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,650
I wonder if I can. Is it might just. Maybe it's just cosmetic.

71
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:43,900
If I run through that I wonder how much damage you take. Or is it gonna knock you back?

72
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:56,869
I don't know. Oh that's. That's weird. Maybe I just have to run. He does that weird like

73
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:02,950
jump rope move. I don't. I maybe. It's. It's a. It looks like you just sweep it first and then I

74
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:43,430
fuck all know what the hell it means. All right let's go. Fuck. Nervous up. That's really the

75
00:20:43,430 --> 00:21:22,180
only thing you gotta worry about here. Balls. You got out of that stunt quick. Again. See if I'm.

76
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:44,220
The reason I'm not healing is I'm trying to get a uh. See now. See I thought I had a second between

77
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,500
phase two and three. No. Not you. You. It's like an instant. So I can't do what I'm doing here.

78
00:21:50,700 --> 00:22:09,339
I still don't understand how to get away from that. I still don't understand. I gotta figure

79
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:36,470
that one out. Otherwise it's gonna be the death of me. I still wouldn't. The only move in the

80
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:54,230
first two phases that I don't get. So I thought maybe you could jump over it and grab him.

81
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:01,900
Fuck man. I have no idea. I tried running. I tried jumping. I tried running directly away.

82
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:25,799
Maybe she's gonna. I just have to stay with him. Just fuck it. Just start to run up to him.

83
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:40,890
Just don't ever let him get that far away. That was. No. What? Too far away.

84
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,440
Too far away. At least I know that. That's why it didn't work last time.

85
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:54,740
I'm just like panicking and realizing that I just beat it. I just beat that.

86
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:05,400
Hold on. I need a second. I jumped over it. It landed and I like jumped. So I have to run to

87
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:41,849
the side and jump over it when it lands. Okay. Whoa. That was weird. That was really weird. I

88
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:53,319
like froze in the air. Oh fuck me man. I got it. I do. See if I can get it. Let's practice it.

89
00:24:53,319 --> 00:25:15,940
Just like all time stuff. It's the worst part about this man. These fights take so long that

90
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:30,220
if you just get so tense. I gotta fucking relax. Or here we go. Okay. I'm gonna ring. He makes a

91
00:25:30,220 --> 00:26:05,319
ring. Fuck. It's. Ring again. Oh now I'm in trouble. Now I'm in trouble. Oh god. He comes back the

92
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:21,450
other way. Through the fire. So on phase. Okay. Phase three. When he jumps away. He's either

93
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:35,339
gonna do like a barrage of meteors or a double slide. The double slide is. That usually happens

94
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:44,470
first. Meteor didn't happen till the second one. I don't know how random it is. Honestly I'm trying

95
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,950
to parry now. I'm trying to change things. Just kill me. Kill me. How am I gonna do it again?

96
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,309
Like I gotta. I gotta just do how I know. And not try to add things.

97
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:59,079
I got to the phase three pretty reliably there. I'm not. I'm not gonna do like. Oh let me try parrying

98
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:13,690
now. 25 attempts later. Like no. No. No. No. We're just gonna. He never reads useful shit.

99
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,099
Well I need to figure it out on my own. It's really easy for somebody to say hey go get this

100
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:23,740
item and beat him. But that's. Why would I know that? Unless I found it or hit it. You know what

101
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:36,730
I mean? I'm at the point of no like spoilers in chat. I want to beat him. That's. If I need it I'll

102
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,569
ask for it. If I. I can do it. I'm doing it. You've seen it. I'm in front of you right now.

103
00:27:41,369 --> 00:28:09,220
I got it with like 30. 20 percent phase three. I got. I got it done again. Okay here we go.

104
00:28:10,019 --> 00:29:04,150
I had it so close too. That's so unfortunate. But you gotta do what you gotta do. Oh he's of course

105
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:50,150
to go in the air again. Man come on. Great third swing. This is all you need.

106
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:56,279
Fuck. Oh that caught me. Didn't throw any missiles. What a fucker. Running out of these somehow.

107
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:13,180
Forgot about that. Okay here we go. Here it comes. Run. Okay it's right when it hits the ground.

108
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:40,490
Easy. No. What was wrong there? Fuck. I gotta go backwards with it.

109
00:31:42,250 --> 00:32:17,700
Backwards. It's gotta be longer. It needs travel time. Otherwise you're gonna get hit by it. Stay back.

110
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:34,839
No. Why did I slide? Why would. Why did I slide? I tried to jump. What? I slid into a tree.

111
00:32:35,480 --> 00:33:30,410
Here we go. All right. Don't slide into a tree this time. Thanks again.

112
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:47,579
Let's go. Phase three. Frank. Watch out. He's gonna do the thing. He's gonna.

113
00:33:48,859 --> 00:34:11,099
I don't know. Fuck. Fuck me. Damn it. That fucking stupid swing.

114
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:37,050
Fuck. I don't know what it is. He's gonna throw. What? What? Why? I that's.

115
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:59,500
I did. I've done that the same way every time. Just run at him. Apparently. So running at him

116
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:13,539
every time he's ever thrown the meteors. I get insta-killed that time. I just run forward.

117
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:55,449
She's changing the speeds of how fast he throws them. Sometimes he throws in a fourth swing there

118
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,329
and it's impossible to know when he's gonna do it. It's just randomly he does a fourth swing.

119
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,690
I've not noticed a single reason why he does that. Sometimes it's three. Sometimes it's four.

120
00:36:07,849 --> 00:37:31,829
Three. No. That's it. Three. Why? Why? I don't get it. First phase is easy now. Yeah.

121
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:55,639
Really it's the combo going from two to three. It hurts every time you do it.

122
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:12,250
Dodged into it. I gotta parry them. Oh no. Bad. Bad Jeremy. Bad Jeremy. Oh.

123
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:20,219
Oh. Make one fucking mistake. It's over in like a 15 minute boss fight.

124
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,420
One piece of human error just fucking ruins it all.

125
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:50,409
I'm getting closer when I don't get fucking caught up in the bullshit.

126
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:57,460
This first phase is I barely even have to use a fucking potion.

127
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,780
Get out of the corner here. It's a bad place for all of us.

128
00:39:37,500 --> 00:41:09,739
Stop. No. Don't be stupid.

129
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,800
Caught in one move. You got. I gotta be. Excellent. Excellent. Let's go.

130
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:12,550
Fuck. So. Fuck me. Why? I was waiting for the fucking.

131
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:35,719
More perfect. No. All right. Is it gonna be the fucking meteors? No. It's this.

132
00:42:35,719 --> 00:43:25,829
This is a huge wind up. Hey, come on. What's it gonna be? Meteors? Nope.

133
00:43:25,829 --> 00:45:07,110
I gotta grab him too. I can't step sideways because the fucking fire. Oh my god.

134
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:56,949
Dude, what the fuck? It's instant. Jesus. What? The fucking hidden box was bullshit.

135
00:45:57,909 --> 00:47:23,639
Daddy. What? He's gonna do it again? No. God. Why? Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me.

136
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:43,340
Oh no. Oh my god. So close again. When he gets the. When he. The. The. The. The.

137
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:51,900
Barrage. You can't run through him. You gotta dodge him. God. This guy sucks.

138
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:59,059
Ugh. If it just didn't take so long. It's like the longest fight in the whole game. Dude's got more

139
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:06,340
health than Medir. From fucking Dark Souls 3. With like four people in the party. Give me a break.

140
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:36,340
That was such a decent attempt too. Like I really had it. That was such a good attempt.

141
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,250
Jesus man. I got the mortal blade in my hands. You sure? Are you sure you didn't buy this from

142
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,409
the fucking party store? Because that's what it feels like when you play this game sometimes.

143
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,690
Is this. Are you sure this isn't the wooden trading sword from fucking Legend of Zelda?

144
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,300
You sure? This is the mortal blade. Just want to make sure you're aware of that secure.

145
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:14,099
I hope you have the right one. Not the eBay knockoff that you spent like fucking 39 dollars on.

146
00:49:34,789 --> 00:50:15,030
If I heal in phase one it's pretty much over. You know. I don't know how that wasn't a dodge.

147
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,260
Is this the final boss? No. This is an optional boss.

148
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,739
Somewhere in the corner in the fucking world somewhere.

149
00:50:47,179 --> 00:51:12,329
That was quick. That's the fastest you've ever done that. Go back to being a Fortnite stream.

150
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:28,250
If only. If only that's what I was doing right now. That was happening. But he's in a bad place.

151
00:51:30,170 --> 00:52:46,039
I took the fucking god damn wall here. There's no. I can't run around in here. Stupid fucking boss.

152
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:53,099
From Software. I like the game you came up with here. Sekiro.

153
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,980
That'll die twice. It's a really interesting concept. A game that can only be completed by

154
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:06,570
a computer. It's like. You made it for AI. That's great. I like it. It's great.

155
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:14,219
From Software makes the first video game that is completable by artificial intelligence. They made

156
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:20,150
it for the robots. I guess the robots have taken over. They're already getting video games made

157
00:53:20,150 --> 00:54:03,159
for. Sooner or later. You guys are watching me playing this game. No. You're going to be buying

158
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:08,519
games for your computer to play them. You're going to be like. Oh shit he just got him.

159
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:25,159
There's going to be lines of fucking code. You're going to be watching me watch a computer

160
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:57,260
beat this game. If I don't do it this time I'm going to. I'm going to go farm for resurrection.

161
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:08,550
Because I feel like I wouldn't have been able to do it by now. I know what the slide is.

162
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:23,940
I know it. I know that right. OK hold on. I'm pressing the left thumb stick again because

163
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,619
it's so intense running around. And we have four actions tied to the same button.

164
00:55:30,980 --> 00:57:12,119
Whoa. I don't like where you are. Video games. Time for video games. All right now I'm pretty

165
00:57:12,119 --> 00:59:08,010
quiet. Nobody talk. No. What the fuck. Here we go. What's it going to be. He's done it. I did it.

166
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:15,530
I'm a computer. I get to be a computer. I get to be a computer. I get to live my life as a computer

167
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:42,940
now. Oh that was fucking insane. The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of

168
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,659
the wolf. Commune with the sculptors out and confront memories of battle. Yeah the one-armed

169
00:59:47,659 --> 01:00:00,409
demon prowled the battlefield consumed by flames of deepest resentment. And a lapis. Was that

170
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:09,659
actually harder than an orphan. No. I said that last night that I think it was the same type of

171
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:18,139
issue that I had with orphan. I just think he has a lot of health. I just think he has a shit load

172
01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:35,909
of health. And here's the thing. If you take the health down by like even 10 20 percent it actually

173
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:45,260
might ruin that encounter because here's the thing. I always I never really like phase encounters in

174
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,619
these games because you take you spend so much time trying to learn the new moves that they do

175
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:56,139
that you almost forget the old ones. That's what kind of happened in the three or four times I

176
01:00:56,139 --> 01:01:02,380
saw phase three is I was so desperate to figure out and learn the new move that he gets that you

177
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:10,650
almost just fucking completely forget about the other first two phases. But I think it's by design

178
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:16,780
what there really only is about five moves that are just difficult to understand. And that's what

179
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,500
I'm saying people look when people were saying oh wait why are you not doing it like this. I'm

180
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:29,110
gonna I gotta figure it out you know I'm gonna just do it. You know I could I've made that

181
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:39,559
encounter way easier by going to get like item x maybe. We don't want to hear your life story.

182
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:54,840
What? I'm like defending myself. I got 15 000 fucking souls. Look I just beat one of the

183
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,989
hardest encounters in the whole game. I you know I can't. On to the next one immediately.

184
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:19,980
I can't sit here for fucking two minutes? Really? Really? One guy said that.

185
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:29,880
Any regular circumstance I would go fucking take a bath right now. In fact I might just have to

186
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:45,739
control her in my hand and be in the bath. Mob that guy. Come on like this is a fucking wildly

187
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:51,179
focused encounter. It's like a full almost five to ten minute straight boss fight.

188
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:55,019
I think I should be able to sit here for like a couple minutes and just talk.

189
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,250
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe. Okay a man who failed to become Shura instead became a

190
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:13,159
vessel for the flames of hatred. As fate would have it he was bound stubbornly to his world.

191
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,880
It wasn't until he became a demon that he was finally able to depart for the next.

192
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:31,179
Interesting. Why no face cam? I don't like face cam. I don't really do face cam if you're new.

193
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:53,260
Sealed shut why? All right so I did it. Now I have to go. I did the two snakes because there was a

194
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:59,030
giant fuck-off demon at the door. I guess that is why you would seal the door. He's wearing I'm not

195
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,710
wearing the same shirt again. I'm wearing a like workout shirt because I knew I was going to be

196
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:20,179
like freaking the fuck out and talking about like AI and shit. Um is this that lady? Is this the rice

197
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:24,099
lady?

198
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:30,789
You know don't you know who the one-armed demon was before?

199
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:42,570
See it might be better that way. What a fate to be set ablaze in the fires of hatred

200
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:51,130
and suffer eternally as a demon. You put an end to his misery. That's all it was.

201
01:04:53,769 --> 01:05:01,699
Okay so the hatred he channeled has lost its vessel. The longer the fires of war rage on

202
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:12,599
or ash it that does not mean you should step into his place. Maybe if I bring him some sake.

203
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:28,219
He sure did love that. No more sculptor at the at the idol. All of a sudden I gotta fight this big

204
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:41,989
guy over here. Do you know who that was? Better that you don't. Knock one back for him. I will

205
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:53,179
right now. Pour out a monkey booze. He did like like he did like all the booze we brought on.

206
01:05:55,769 --> 01:06:11,690
Interesting. Well that was fucking hard. That's the I'll be honest with you. That was the hardest

207
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:17,130
boss I think I've bought in a like From Software game. That's like maybe Orphan and well Madeir.

208
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:29,190
Madeir was just hell because it just took too long. I feel good though. I do feel very satisfied. My

209
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:39,980
soul was ripped apart. Is there anything else I can do here? I just walked off the edge. Thank

210
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,699
god there's like an idiot wall because I was just gonna walk this way. Prove you're not wearing the

211
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:53,610
same shirt. No I don't have to do that. I don't have to prove I'm not. I don't have to prove

212
01:06:53,610 --> 01:07:01,579
anything. I think we go back to the estate. We have to go through the door right? Anything else

213
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:14,309
is probably something secret here. Let me go back to the idol. Wait hello. What do you got?

214
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:34,460
No I've already seen you. Two heavy coin purses. Computers don't wear clothes. How far am I? I'm

215
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,380
at the end of the game. So if you just popped in here to be like oh did he just get out.

216
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,179
You don't want to be here. I'm literally at like the final probably an hour or two of the game

217
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:59,349
and by hour or two I mean I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked for like at least two or three

218
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:06,599
hours but that's fine. I'm willing to go crazy. I'm gonna lose it. I barely started talking about

219
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:14,139
how computers are gonna take over and that's nothing. You ain't heard anything yet. Still

220
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:33,029
don't have one of those. What about skills? He still doesn't have the spear. No I'm not gonna

221
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:39,750
have it. I'll be the one guy that doesn't have the spear. That's fine. I don't care. It's not

222
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:45,420
necessary with a video game end game. All right what. Get that off the screen before somebody

223
01:08:45,420 --> 01:09:01,340
screams at you. Okay so I have. Why is this not available? This I need that to get this.

224
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:15,909
Living force is through here which I'm gonna need this and that. I don't know what to do with these

225
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:32,819
points. Maybe the midair tool because we're at the very end of the game unless there's something I

226
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:49,750
really desperately am gonna need here. Midair combo maybe or vault over. Maybe midair combo.

227
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:59,060
I don't know but there's only like a couple maybe more of the emblems.

228
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:10,710
It's one. Yeah fuck it. But I feel like maybe that it's only one right. Is that gonna be enough for

229
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:29,130
me to. I can do both. Combo arts while in the air. I mean just if I. I feel like that it's

230
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:40,229
necessary at some point. And then shadow rush. So I need three more. Have I ever used a combo? Yeah

231
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:44,069
I use this thing pretty frequently. I use this pretty frequently.

232
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:47,670
Ever since I got it. I use it on. I don't use it on bosses though.

233
01:10:48,630 --> 01:11:05,979
Oh a box. What the fuck is this? Phantom Gunai can be used to upgrade the loaded shuriken.

234
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:26,489
And I think I got. It's the spear. I got Luigi. How many prayer beads do I have? Come on where's

235
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:34,890
my prayer bead? I have like I need two more right. I have to pay money for the spear. What do I got

236
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:47,909
for cash? Let's see. I have no. How much do I got? I got thousand two thousand twenty one hundred.

237
01:11:49,109 --> 01:12:11,979
Not enough. I could sell some stuff though. Dragon Rock cured. So I have zeroed for

238
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:21,100
the worst part. I feel like I've missed so many prayer beads. How you doing? You good?

239
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:40,649
I don't think there's any more business for you right now. Okay I think I'm ready. Let's continue.

240
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,840
Now where was it? It was not. Was it Kuro's room? No there was like a secret door or something right.

241
01:12:52,840 --> 01:13:10,859
No no no it was the reservoir right. So I gotta go back to the reservoir. When you feel like you

242
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:14,939
missed something but you don't know what. Yeah it's always like that with these games though.

243
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:30,949
What do you have? I already bought it. Okay there's mask fragment two. Mask fragment one is over there.

244
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:38,329
Where's the other one? Five thousand dollars. Guys I'm not gonna buy that. May the departed

245
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:45,500
rest in peace. All right so we're gonna go back to the reservoir which was um is it this way or that

246
01:13:45,500 --> 01:14:03,000
way? What's the mask for? I don't know. I also got two. I spent all that time getting the snake hearts

247
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:28,729
and I have no idea what those do. No this is wrong. This is the castle entrance. This is like the

248
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:40,550
giant moat. Why does the mox keep popping up on the screen man? The snake hearts are for a true

249
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:59,210
ending. Oh how do I do it? So then I can is it down here? It's this way. I think it's down here.

250
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:25,399
This is like the moat right. I gotta go down. Is this the right way? Um I don't think it is.

251
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:40,600
Is it? I need to get like a higher. I need to get a better view. I wonder if I can still get

252
01:15:40,600 --> 01:16:08,010
there from here. LOL moments with Jerma985. No this is more desperately clinging to

253
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:18,630
trying to be good at a video game. Eight five. What? Oh they're just fighting.

254
01:16:20,229 --> 01:17:04,149
No this is that's just where it was. I just I was just here. Stop caring. All right this is just a

255
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:08,149
mess. It's pretty this may this may as well just be dark so it's pretty bleak here.

256
01:17:08,789 --> 01:17:17,050
No I don't even want to fight you guys. I just want to go to wherever I need to go.

257
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:20,729
It's like that beginning area of the game with a huge bridge.

258
01:17:21,609 --> 01:18:09,770
Uh and I can't teleport here. Oh I think this is it. Is this it? You don't want to do that. That's

259
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:39,960
what I'm trying to stop. Oh fuck who's the boss? All right. Two at the same time. It's a backstab

260
01:18:40,359 --> 01:19:04,069
but I guess okay well um come back. I have two. This is no way. Like I have to backstab one of

261
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:17,829
them. You know what I'm gonna try something. So that guy's turning though. Okay how do I fucking

262
01:19:17,829 --> 01:20:00,569
jump on that guy? Do I just have to kick that guy's ass first as fast as I can? Let's fight him. Let's

263
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:18,550
go. You and me. He kind of just he just hit me. Okay I should probably back up a little.

264
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:27,319
He doesn't know which way to go. See? How much does this suck buddy? Doesn't it suck to have to

265
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:48,840
fight two people at the same time? Yeah it sucks doesn't it? Yeah you see it in real time how hard

266
01:20:48,840 --> 01:21:22,220
it is. Come on. No that that whoops. Don't go into the fire. Don't go into the fire.

267
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:32,199
I don't know how hard this guy was. I mean yeah I did have I did have something helping me but

268
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:47,029
fairies. I remember that guy giving me so much trouble. Even uh yeah I did have a co-op partner

269
01:21:47,029 --> 01:22:00,060
but still. You live? I tried to talk to him. He apparently didn't want to talk. Okay well I tried.

270
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:11,670
Uh I'm gonna just revive my shit because that guy's not gonna come back. One of them will but

271
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:20,779
it's fine. I don't care. I'm just gonna leave anyways. This looks like the correct way to go.

272
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:38,279
To the secret door and there's a new idol there but exploring this area is probably a good idea.

273
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:51,380
Oh no. Why? They make it look so it's so it's right there. It's just right there for you.

274
01:22:51,380 --> 01:23:15,779
Waiting for you to do it. No apparently not. Now I can do it. Wow that in no way anyone can do that.

275
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:27,609
That's superhuman strength right there. Hell it's nothing else to do. I think I'm just gonna go.

276
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:42,090
He has a robot arm. I mean I guess so. He does have a robot arm. You're right. He is made out

277
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:48,380
of robotics. See he's fucking AI already taking over. I told you who they made this game for.

278
01:23:53,460 --> 01:24:12,119
Uh what about up here? Nothing? No. All right here we go. Rest a bit. Secret passage key has

279
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:39,560
been used. Let's take it to the next area. Activate boomer bot. Okay. Is there a reason why every

280
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:45,319
FromSoftware game has an end zone like this? Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne.

281
01:24:53,800 --> 01:25:01,619
This is lightning guy right? Oh shit I really did buy mine on eBay.

282
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,380
I have the real one. You bought the one on the convention floor.

283
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:24,279
No one has the right to the dragon's heritage. It is no one's to bear.

284
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:44,789
I wish there was another way. It's all right. We started here. We end here. We both have mortal

285
01:25:44,789 --> 01:25:55,539
blades. Wait does that mean if I die then the game ends? Yes. Let's finish this. That seems kind of

286
01:25:55,539 --> 01:25:58,579
weird. Wait but we both have mortal blades. I can't lose this fight.

287
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,210
You got a long wind-up time here. That's a thrust.

288
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:16,869
That's also a thrust. No it's not. What he just reversed my reversal?

289
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:24,069
Wait a minute. He reversed. I reversed you and you reversed me? That doesn't work. What?

290
01:26:56,250 --> 01:27:00,970
What? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm dead. What? He can't reverse that?

291
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:23,609
Is that? That's a thrust. Was that a thrust? Well game over. I lose. Okay.

292
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:09,720
Wow I dodged it somehow. Okay he's gonna get his moveset down. It's hard to get a moveset down

293
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:25,539
when you die instantly. Okay here's the grab right? Coming up. I'm not sure I can block those.

294
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:48,520
That? No fuck. I'm against the wall here. I can't move. There we go.

295
01:28:56,390 --> 01:29:04,500
It's hard to see through the grass. Like the high flower is making it hard to see what he's doing.

296
01:29:22,939 --> 01:29:26,460
He changes it up a lot. He's got a sweep. He's got a thrust. He's gonna grab and he

297
01:29:26,859 --> 01:29:32,859
there's different thrusts. He has two different thrusts. All right this is fun. Let's go.

298
01:29:45,510 --> 01:30:12,100
No the sweep. I thought it was thrust. Fuck man. Heal. Sweep again. Jesus Christ. Oh my.

299
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:22,699
It's an instant. I'm dead. Instantly. Fuck me. Okay. I was thinking there.

300
01:30:23,659 --> 01:30:38,649
I tried to jump but pressed two buttons at the same time. Jesus.

301
01:30:42,119 --> 01:31:01,220
That move is the best time to get any games in. All right. Goodbye. Mortal blade. You got your

302
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:09,880
mortal blade taken from you. I'll take it. I can't wait for the centipede to blow out of the top of

303
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:22,979
his head. Right? That's definitely not the whole fight. He's gonna cut himself in half.

304
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:58,699
I was in there for so long.

305
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:13,939
Pitiful grandchild. It stinks in here. What? How? The person can't fit in there. Who the fuck? How

306
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:41,979
do you fit in there? What? He just like shed that guy. What the fuck? Ishi- Ishi- Ishi- Ishii was

307
01:32:41,979 --> 01:33:36,229
dead. Three health bars. No. Easy now. Oh you're fast. And that's okay. That's a slash. One, two,

308
01:33:36,229 --> 01:34:03,239
three. He's got a couple combos. Okay. Um. I gotta see as much of him as I can. What the fuck? Okay.

309
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:21,140
It's a long charge. I think he'd probably dash around it. I'm also just realizing something

310
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:30,300
really important. I gotta fight this dickhead every time. No. Do I have to fight Ginnituro again?

311
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:42,840
No. Like you haven't figured it out like after so long. Like I don't wanna fight these four people.

312
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:48,409
That's four health bars. Eventually this is gonna get to a point where this guy is not even a problem

313
01:34:48,409 --> 01:35:19,579
anymore. It's just an annoyance. I got it. It's not even- It's four- It's a four health. Just think of

314
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:37,079
it as a four health bar fight with cutscenes in the middle. And we're gonna have- We're gonna- All

315
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:44,520
right. See. Uh. What time is it right now? It's like 5 30 pacific. All right. I'll see you at like 10

316
01:35:44,520 --> 01:36:27,989
p.m. when I maybe eventually get this guy down to one bubble. Fuck. I thought I could get it right

317
01:36:27,989 --> 01:36:47,159
there. It was sloppy. Bring on granddad. I don't know why I'm not watching the cutscene. All right.

318
01:36:47,319 --> 01:37:00,329
All right. Here we go. Eight flasks. Sweep. Jesus Christ. Just give it to the bottle.

319
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:31,109
What the fuck is he doing? Damn it. I got it. Oh boy. He's gonna do it.

320
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:43,510
Come on. Let me get to phase two. Let me see it. I tried to. I'm an idiot.

321
01:37:44,229 --> 01:38:00,119
Fuck me, man. Oh, I still got health. No. I don't- It's hard to tell sometimes if he's dead or not. He like

322
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:14,039
lies on the ground for something. It's too long. Sometimes you spend like an extra second like you do

323
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:36,260
like the- I died. I had like 0.2% health. Well, very obviously it was becoming very obvious.

324
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:41,939
This guy, you have to just go in. You see what happened that first thing when I was doing right

325
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:55,020
there? Not with you in particular. Now I'm just fucking being stupid. It happens. That happens

326
01:38:55,020 --> 01:39:00,699
every single fucking time. I heal right when he's about to do that move. Just do it again.

327
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:18,460
That has happened every time. I heal. No, when he's going for the slash. He's reading my inputs.

328
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:31,270
The thing it seems with Isshin is his posture wasn't that great. If you stay up on him,

329
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:48,920
let me just get there. Speaking of posture, mine's pretty bad right now. Oh my god. Oh my god. What

330
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:57,989
am I doing? I beat it- I did it so easily like two tries ago and now he's just kicking the shit out

331
01:39:57,989 --> 01:41:04,119
of me. What the fuck? My god. What the fuck? Why? I had it so- when I par- I deflect the fuck out of

332
01:41:04,119 --> 01:41:18,090
him and my posture gets destroyed. I deflected almost every attack he did and my posture is gone.

333
01:41:26,920 --> 01:42:13,829
I will restore Isshin to glory. Fuck. Now he- he ducks in the grass, man. Oh my fucking god.

334
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:29,979
Get out of here. Look like the real boss, you chump.

335
01:42:41,539 --> 01:43:02,069
You gotta stay up on him. Damn it. Look at me. Look at his posture.

336
01:43:02,789 --> 01:43:28,710
He's got a dash around it when he goes up in the air like that.

337
01:43:29,350 --> 01:44:07,640
I tried. I tried to grab it. Slash. Fuck. Jesus, man.

338
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:17,020
He's so good. His moves are so hard to predict.

339
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:24,279
Holy shit, he's insane. And this is phase one. Oh my god.

340
01:44:24,279 --> 01:44:42,789
I'm gonna need to deflect the first one. Good luck. Good luck. That's all, I'm dead.

341
01:44:51,590 --> 01:45:10,649
You are in hell now. This took me 52 tries. See you in five hours. This took some people

342
01:45:10,649 --> 01:45:31,500
six to seven hours to do. Holy shit. Wow, that's ridiculous.

343
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:57,560
All right. Wow, that's unbelievable. No, he does it every time. Jeremy, what are you doing?

344
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:07,850
He does it every time you eat. Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. What? He's hiding. He's like

345
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:20,979
behind the fucking turd. He's on the fucking turd. Can this kill me? Like, that was fucking stupid.

346
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:44,699
I just got, I got LOS'd by the giant shit rock in the middle. I love when you username it

347
01:46:44,699 --> 01:47:33,210
third person. I'm trying to tell myself to relax. Dude, how many, how many dings am I going to get

348
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:56,579
in a row? Jesus Christ, why? What is he doing? God. Ding, coming at you. Ding, coming at you.

349
01:47:56,579 --> 01:47:59,619
Ding, this time I'm going to do it four times in a row. Oh, what the fuck?

350
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:12,680
His posture is nearly full. Yeah, but all it takes is for you to get hit once.

351
01:48:13,989 --> 01:48:17,909
Sekiro. Shadows get hit two times and die. That's the new title of this game.

352
01:48:52,899 --> 01:49:07,140
It's not even worth it to resurrect. It really isn't. If I, if you, because you have to fight

353
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:11,619
grandpa, you have to fight hyper grandpa with three fucking bars.

354
01:49:47,340 --> 01:50:27,050
Why did I not? Fuck, really? Letting me hit you. All right, seer old granddad.

355
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:30,170
I didn't even know where he was. That was a weird camera.

356
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:55,659
Nope. Look at that posture damage I'm doing to him. It's not even, it's nothing. It's like touching.

357
01:50:55,659 --> 01:51:30,229
I'm just like tapping him on the shoulder. What? Wow. That was a huge sweep. Wow. I tried to block

358
01:51:30,229 --> 01:52:16,619
it. I did though. Thankfully. Oh fuck, no. God damn it. Oh my God. Die in one hit. It's a, I don't

359
01:52:16,619 --> 01:52:20,060
even know, man. It's so hard. He puts the thing in the sheath and then who the fuck knows what he's

360
01:52:20,060 --> 01:53:02,819
doing? Holy shit. You know, we talk about like people that will complete this game and somebody

361
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:08,680
said, who is this game for last night? I, I wonder what the steam achievements will be for us.

362
01:53:09,399 --> 01:53:13,659
Or like somebody that was beating Isshin. I wonder how many people would stump it

363
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:55,420
and get this far. It's gotta be like 0.2%. What the hell are you doing? I thought it was,

364
01:53:56,140 --> 01:54:39,420
it was a little early, but I still got it. God, grandpa. Is it a slash? Yep.

365
01:54:40,060 --> 01:55:00,739
No, I don't even, man. It's so, he's such a variance in his move set.

366
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:05,619
It's almost like you can't even predict. You just gotta, you have to block everything he does. It's

367
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:11,220
hard to determine when he's gonna fucking do anything. We got no telegraphs really except

368
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:34,710
for the dings. God, man. No. All right, can I just like accept that he's better than me?

369
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:37,270
And we'll watch the YouTube video at the end of the game.

370
01:55:41,689 --> 01:55:47,770
No, it's so fast, man. You don't even get a second to react to it. I gotta get like burned into my

371
01:55:47,770 --> 01:56:16,119
brain. Holy fuck. God. In front of him? In front of him for that move maybe? I don't know. Maybe

372
01:56:16,119 --> 01:56:55,979
he's standing in front of him. What? No, I thought it was gonna get a ding. Just don't get hit. You

373
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:05,699
underestimate how hard this is. Let me get some shit here. I don't really want to use anything

374
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:18,699
until I have, I'll get this off the bar. I don't really want to use sugars until I can reliably

375
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:25,930
get them at least down to like the first phase. I'll get them on the bar just to have them, but

376
01:57:26,569 --> 01:57:43,350
I only have three. How many do I have in storage? Eleven. Play the inspiration music? Oh, we're not

377
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:51,670
ready for that yet. I can't even get this guy past the first bubble. Yeah, I'm not going to use any

378
01:57:51,670 --> 01:58:01,850
of these until I can reliably get him to at least pass first to second phase. I have no more spirit

379
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:22,699
emblems. Oh wow, that's bad. Well, there goes my whole shit moment. I'll be honest, I think I have

380
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:27,979
to take a break. The demon of hatred was so un-fucking-bearable that I think I have to

381
01:58:27,979 --> 01:58:36,579
take a break and like come back in like 15 minutes or something and do it. Like just, just chill for

382
01:58:36,579 --> 01:58:56,229
like 10 minutes. Though these two back to back is like no way. Not gonna happen. I'll try it one

383
01:58:56,229 --> 01:59:25,670
more time and then I'm gonna need like spirit emblems. This is gonna be a nightmare. I thought,

384
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:33,130
wow, I thought I was in the right. Did it hit me with the handle? It hit me in the head with the

385
01:59:33,130 --> 02:00:17,239
handle. Posture is gone. No one can come. No, man. Posture, please. I'm so sweaty right now too.

386
02:00:17,239 --> 02:00:36,039
This is like, this is the hardest work that I've had in like three years. Your posture will break

387
02:00:36,039 --> 02:00:44,359
if you miss a parry. You know how hard it is to block a parry every move? That's like unreliable.

388
02:00:45,319 --> 02:01:06,489
I'm trying to parry these guys. It's just so awkward. He hesitates on half of them.

389
02:01:08,489 --> 02:01:32,520
Fat tracking. No, I thought it was this big sweep. Oh my fucking god. Not even scratched on him by the way.

390
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:41,939
No, I thought he was putting it in the sheath. I thought he was going right in the sheath.

391
02:01:45,659 --> 02:02:11,619
Now I'm dead. And I can't even second.

392
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:36,890
Fuck. One bubble. Let's see phase two. Let's just look at it. Let me just see it and then I'll watch

393
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:51,220
the rest on YouTube. I'll watch the rest of this on YouTube. What happened? He has a gun.

394
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:58,859
He's got a gun. He has a different weapon. They already did this in the last game.

395
02:02:59,819 --> 02:03:42,649
I'm just gonna use the fucking turd rocket. Christ. He pulled out a gun. Whatever.

396
02:03:43,609 --> 02:03:50,340
That's ridiculous, man. Oh my goodness gracious. This is fucking wild.

397
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:54,500
They know how fucking around these last few encounters. Especially like these last two.

398
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:58,199
They were just like, yeah, you know, you like thought things were hard, but

399
02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:03,460
we're on like AI level of difficulty now. Just kill me.

400
02:04:16,199 --> 02:04:21,079
All right. Last. Last. Last time. Last attempt. And then I'm gonna.

401
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:25,239
I'm just gonna fucking stare at the screen for five minutes. I don't even know what to do.

402
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:36,489
I wish I didn't have to do this.

403
02:04:41,829 --> 02:04:48,949
Uh, and you come on. I'm like, you come here with the fucking last little bit of that.

404
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:51,750
All right. I gotta take a break. This is insanity.

405
02:04:52,710 --> 02:05:04,569
I'll be back in like two minutes. I'm just gonna. I'm gonna go walk around for water in my face.

406
02:05:05,369 --> 02:07:13,430
I'll be right back. I haven't had any pause in the game. I have to just memorize everything.

407
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:24,220
I have to play space channel five with a sword. Left, right, left, right, chew, chew, chew, up,

408
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:59,609
up, honda, honda, honda, chew, honda, store. Oh, he got me with that. I get out of here. My posture.

409
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:08,170
Oh my God. I was trying to be tracking from dark souls two.

410
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:52,810
Dark souls two is he's gone. No, I think that he thinks he's going to keep going around.

411
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:57,529
He does that big long. He does a big long.

412
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:20,699
We'll talk about it after I die in like 30 seconds. Let's try it again.

413
02:09:35,579 --> 02:09:39,180
Look at this posture already.

414
02:09:39,899 --> 02:09:50,279
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man.

415
02:09:55,180 --> 02:10:04,199
No, it's a. I don't even know why they have healing boards for this fight.

416
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:43,779
You don't have an opportunity to do it. Damn it. No, I just didn't know. He's back.

417
02:10:52,069 --> 02:11:18,520
Hesitation is defeat. Hesitation is defeat. But Sekiro.

418
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:25,000
Hesitation is defeat. But sorry, you haven't memorized every single animation the developers

419
02:11:25,000 --> 02:12:09,800
have made. Sekiro, why didn't you memorize every move I do? I didn't even get to respond before

420
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:36,260
he started that animation. Young Sekiro, don't let me hit you. Forehead.

421
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:16,220
Stop hesitating.

422
02:13:18,539 --> 02:13:24,979
This is so ridiculous. This is a case study. They got hired by like the government to make

423
02:13:24,979 --> 02:14:17,529
this game. This is like a government project. What if he's fucking with you? Hesitate before

424
02:14:17,529 --> 02:14:35,479
doing anything. Maybe let's just run the fuck away. You know what I mean?

425
02:14:55,289 --> 02:15:01,739
Oh no, it was. I thought it was the big one. Is there any way to tell? Because seriously,

426
02:15:01,739 --> 02:15:09,340
he puts the sheath in and oh, is it a sweep or is it the big one? You got that like 10th of a

427
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:17,609
fucking second to react to these things. Like in human reaction time. It's just what the fuck?

428
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:35,989
It's because it's human reaction time. That's what I went so wrong.

429
02:15:36,869 --> 02:15:59,159
That's how you do it. No, but that's that's this one. See, it's so weird. I thought it was done.

430
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:34,229
Can't. The heal is like a is a vulnerability. It's like hard to get yourself out of that mindset

431
02:16:34,229 --> 02:17:59,909
where don't ask me. I'm trying guys. It's sloppy. What? No. Oh, yeah. Could have blocked it. Yeah,

432
02:17:59,909 --> 02:18:06,780
but here's the thing. They put in this rock, paper, scissor gameplay that I'm like waiting

433
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:11,020
to see that emblem because I can't. I have to do the whatever I have to the technique is to get

434
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:15,659
away from it. So when he goes down here, I come for a sweep. Nope, no, no, no, no. It's just regular

435
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:33,620
text. It's just like fuck, man. Makes it so much harder. Like, see, he did the sweep at that same

436
02:18:33,620 --> 02:19:00,739
thing last time. And it wasn't that you know, like he ducked down and did hurt. But this time,

437
02:19:00,739 --> 02:19:14,780
the indicator popped up. He did that before and he went into a combo kind of win the lottery with

438
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:43,079
the number of scratch tickets. I didn't get any of those. I'm just hesitating now. I'm

439
02:19:43,879 --> 02:20:05,319
just getting exhausted. Fucking playing this. I thought he was gonna

440
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:28,680
can't jump over that. Trying to test it if I could. See, my reaction time is just dwindled

441
02:20:29,479 --> 02:20:44,010
from doing this for so long in a row. No, I don't have the demon thing on anymore. I crushed it.

442
02:20:44,649 --> 02:20:55,020
This took me five hours to beat somebody said.

443
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,940
That's why I'm telling you this is a government experiment.

444
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:15,659
Okay, he's still got that. I think I'm gonna go get spirit emblems and just take a second

445
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:20,860
because when you do it so many times in a row, you just, it's everything's blend together and

446
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:49,579
it becomes impossible. Yeah, I'm lost. I've drained every ounce of my energy at the demon

447
02:21:49,579 --> 02:21:54,139
fucking hatred. And now I'm just like fucking on fumes right now fighting this.

448
02:22:07,299 --> 02:22:25,500
I need like a second wind or something, man. Give me like a second wind.

449
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:34,649
Inject caffeine directly into your bloodstream. I don't know if that's a good idea.

450
02:22:35,129 --> 02:23:14,040
Oh no, I thought I could, I thought it was a big circle around you.

451
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:37,770
You can parry it, but I just wish I could fight him and not have to go through the first guy

452
02:23:37,770 --> 02:23:45,049
every time. This is like, the phase two is like fucking 10 times worse than this shit.

453
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:04,010
The first guy's a weakling. Yeah, I know he is. But remember what I just said about how

454
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:08,489
doing the same thing over and over again, your brain just starts to hate it. Like I don't want

455
02:24:08,489 --> 02:24:17,180
to fight Genichiro every time. I already killed him. Start me like right when the grandfather

456
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:33,479
cutscene happens. We don't have to do this again. It's reaching a seven. Oh shit, it is frustrating.

457
02:24:44,219 --> 02:25:03,930
He said a nine. Well, this is the last boss in the whole game. So I mean, like, of course,

458
02:25:04,729 --> 02:25:08,889
of course with their computer, they wanted to make the encounter fucking like

459
02:25:08,889 --> 02:25:14,250
2% of every player will ever beat it. That's fine. I'm going to try to be one of like the 3%

460
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:36,180
of every human who's purchased this game to beat it. I have to actually like go get spirit

461
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:41,219
emblems or something. This is all blended into my brain. Like everything's the same. Everything,

462
02:25:41,219 --> 02:25:45,219
the whole world is going together. Every color, every flower is turning into the same flower.

463
02:25:46,020 --> 02:26:34,950
All right. Don't I have a thing? There it is, right? Now this kills me. Where's the thing that I can

464
02:26:34,950 --> 02:27:08,569
give myself spirit emblems? Is it a combat art or what? Ceremonial tanto. I only have three of them.

465
02:27:08,569 --> 02:27:25,190
I mean, what? Plus five. That doesn't seem like very much. I only, I can only use once per life.

466
02:27:25,909 --> 02:27:42,950
I guess I could buy them too. How much money? How much do they cost? 50 for one. Well,

467
02:27:42,950 --> 02:28:03,319
what else am I going to spend my money on, right? 500 coins is 10. What's, what's the point of this

468
02:28:03,319 --> 02:28:31,270
even being in the game? This is like 500 bucks. No, I'd rather just go grind the money. Yeah,

469
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:34,229
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm taking a break from this shit. I'm going to go do something else.

470
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:51,450
Fuck this final encounter. I know there was a couple of mini bosses I could fight.

471
02:28:56,700 --> 02:29:04,950
There's still like two or three. Are there any more bosses left? No, this is the last one.

472
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:28,489
There was something here. This is with the stealth section, right? In the manor? How many prayer

473
02:29:28,489 --> 02:29:44,069
beats do you have? I couldn't do this with at least eight. Um, let me see. Where are they here? One,

474
02:29:44,069 --> 02:30:03,719
two, three, four, five, six. I have six. Am I under postured? You don't need eight.

475
02:30:10,729 --> 02:30:18,659
Uh, I feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable. I'm missing a, a gourd too, somehow. There's no way

476
02:30:18,659 --> 02:30:32,389
this game has nine gourds, right? I missed one somewhere. There is 10. Yeah, I would assume.

477
02:30:32,389 --> 02:30:53,239
Um, yeah, gourds really don't matter. That's true. It really is true. Like healing is, I,

478
02:30:53,239 --> 02:31:00,229
when I die, I have like seven or eight healing gourds. You just have to, you gotta be like on

479
02:31:00,229 --> 02:31:53,739
point. See, like I have nine healing gourds.

480
02:33:01,350 --> 02:33:28,229
Fuck! I thought I had a second. Take a heal! Why am I crouching? Crouching! Here we go.

481
02:33:32,469 --> 02:33:34,149
Good luck. For a second time, I've seen it.

482
02:33:34,149 --> 02:35:33,819
And it thrusts right after him. What the fuck is this? The amount of effort it takes to get there.

483
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:39,540
Is like, I, I can like build up some strength for like one or two attempts.

484
02:35:40,340 --> 02:35:50,700
The second phase is like, don't parry him. I'm just gonna dodge around. Right? Like, I mean,

485
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:56,260
maybe? I don't know. I feel, I feel like I'm confused to help do that second phase.

486
02:35:57,219 --> 02:36:23,590
Okay. Remember, just reflect the bullets.

487
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:48,149
Come on, man. Just die. I don't even know how he hit me with that.

488
02:37:30,579 --> 02:38:11,610
Wrong. I have a fucking bunch of dumb fucking moves. Swing 400 times. From something ashy him.

489
02:38:13,530 --> 02:38:23,129
Oh, you go from such a different rhythm. Painful.

490
02:39:21,459 --> 02:39:23,299
I thought it was the thrust, but it wasn't.

491
02:39:23,299 --> 02:40:03,610
All right, two. I'm just gonna take it. Let's try some dodging.

492
02:40:27,659 --> 02:40:57,799
No way. No way. No fucking way, man. No. No, no, no, no.

493
02:41:35,719 --> 02:41:41,799
How many attacks do you have in that sequence? It's almost like you're not even attacking.

494
02:41:41,799 --> 02:42:20,139
Shit's just happening around you. I don't even get a chance, even with a parry.

495
02:42:24,069 --> 02:43:19,860
I'm trying to run, but of course, stuck on the wall. Of course. I, I'll tell you. So it's,

496
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:25,129
the dodge button is the McCurry counter, right? So anytime someone says, why are you dodging

497
02:43:25,129 --> 02:43:30,260
into him? Don't dodge into him. I'm trying to do the McCurry, but dodge is also on that button.

498
02:43:32,889 --> 02:43:48,059
So it just, it happens. Dodge is this button. McCurry counter is also this button. So I'm not

499
02:43:48,059 --> 02:43:59,370
trying to dodge into him. It's just happening because it's the same button. And yeah, the time

500
02:43:59,370 --> 02:44:03,909
is probably off, but that's people looking at it and they go, what the hell is he doing?

501
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:50,059
That's close. I already fucked it up. I wouldn't be surprised if I died more here than I have in

502
02:44:50,059 --> 02:44:54,860
the entire game. Like how many times, how many, okay, how many deaths for the whole entire

503
02:44:54,860 --> 02:45:13,030
experience? Like a hundred times? Do we even have a counter? I'm looking at chat right now. This is

504
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:45,030
a mistake.

505
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:17,739
Parried it already, but oh, it's so frustrating. Fuck me.

506
02:46:46,569 --> 02:46:47,530
Oh, you crap.

507
02:46:47,530 --> 02:46:57,260
Maybe you'll restore Ashina to glory. I don't think he will though. We've had this conversation

508
02:46:57,260 --> 02:47:03,500
over and over and over again. I keep killing you, but yeah, here we are. I have to see your face

509
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:31,959
again. It's great. I love it. He restored Ashina to glory this time and what's going to happen

510
02:47:31,959 --> 02:47:41,340
this time? Maybe I'll prevent him from restoring Ashina to glory. Let's do it again on boss before

511
02:47:41,340 --> 02:48:57,020
the boss. See you next time. Whoops. No, my reaction times is zero. This is it.

512
02:48:57,659 --> 02:49:04,709
I'm gonna, I'm gonna play a different game for like an hour or so. And I am at, I am at a two

513
02:49:04,709 --> 02:49:30,100
for reaction time right now. Damn it. Lentless. I wish there was a stamina bar in this game.

514
02:49:30,899 --> 02:49:35,129
I'm able to manage half these motherfuckers better than I can now.

515
02:49:51,670 --> 02:49:55,110
Pull me out of your neck. I'll fight this whippersnapper for you.

516
02:49:59,579 --> 02:50:01,899
Let me just reach into my neck and see what I got here.

517
02:50:51,979 --> 02:51:03,420
This young secco though, try me again in the second phase. Let's do it son.

518
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:30,569
Even the fucking parry is ridiculous.

519
02:52:04,149 --> 02:52:34,440
Let me get a follow-up there. No follow-ups allowed. Huge move. No follow-up. No, it takes

520
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:40,600
too long. Parrying any of his moves with the spear, you can't do a follow-up. It just does

521
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:54,120
posture damage to you. That's all it does. Fight! I just barely can get one. See what I'm saying?

522
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:55,719
I can't. You gotta get the fuck out of there.

523
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:13,780
I'm so fucked. No, no, no. I just can't.

524
02:53:48,459 --> 02:54:10,969
Didn't make a fucking break. Give me like a fucking break. And I didn't catch that one.

525
02:54:12,489 --> 02:54:18,840
What the fuck is happening man?

526
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:50,540
Isn't this supposed to be a stealth game? Yeah, I guess. He's already starting with that shit.

527
02:54:53,030 --> 02:55:10,389
So if you heal, you're dead. They have a way to- every time.

528
02:55:14,899 --> 02:55:31,659
I thought it was the- this is next level. It really is.

529
02:55:32,540 --> 02:56:07,559
Uh, prosthetics? I have to grind for spirit ammo.

530
02:56:37,930 --> 02:56:40,569
Okay, I can tell you something. I parried like

531
02:56:41,690 --> 02:56:47,079
98% of every single move. And like still, this motherfucker is still gone.

532
02:57:36,149 --> 02:57:54,780
Fuck. Let's see.

533
02:57:54,780 --> 02:58:22,180
That was not it. I would have caught it. It just was so slow. And that's it. You make one mistake,

534
02:58:22,739 --> 02:59:00,180
strike the whole fucking thing over. Um, this is great. Wow, he's already up here. Fuck. Not

535
02:59:00,180 --> 03:00:30,979
dealing with that. Shit in my face. Back it up. Where- oh, I'm on the fucking end of the bridge.

536
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:34,940
No, no, nope, nope, nope.

537
03:01:12,709 --> 03:02:06,729
Wait. No, I need to see phase three, motherfucker. Phase three. Oh, this is going to be horrible.

538
03:02:07,610 --> 03:02:17,079
What does he do? Wow, it's lightning. What the fuck? Just lightning to strike random places?

539
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:40,219
Oh no. All right, I'm gonna beat this motherfucker. This guy's dead. I'm gonna beat this.

540
03:02:41,450 --> 03:02:49,190
I'm going for it. I can do it. I'm gonna beat him. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna do it.

541
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:57,049
I'm gonna- I'm gonna have to get some fucking Durango juice or something. I'm gonna get like

542
03:02:57,049 --> 03:03:51,459
an apple juice. Bring it on. Let's go. I'm ready. No.

543
03:04:08,329 --> 03:04:26,840
Fuckin' let him fuck you up.

544
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:44,280
Posture. Bad.

545
03:05:41,620 --> 03:05:44,739
No, I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it.

546
03:05:45,620 --> 03:06:30,489
Oh fuck, I forgot he did that shit. Out. Bye. Jump.

547
03:07:13,100 --> 03:07:38,299
No, fuck, fuck, fuck. I thought it was fucking dive. No, it wasn't. I thought I had- I tried

548
03:07:38,299 --> 03:07:52,459
to do the fucking Makiri. Just to- it was too- I saw it. I tried. That's so slow. The delay on

549
03:07:52,459 --> 03:08:02,440
something scared me so much. Un-fucking-bearable. Sometimes he's just like, what? Never comes.

550
03:08:58,500 --> 03:09:13,559
No! Holy shit, I made it. I was sloppy as hell, but all right, come on, old man.

551
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:33,819
Caught me there.

552
03:09:34,540 --> 03:09:42,200
Whoa, that was bad.

553
03:10:20,309 --> 03:10:20,950
Didn't get that.

554
03:10:26,389 --> 03:10:35,579
No, god damn it. Give me a fucking break. That was horse shit. Oh my god. One mistake.

555
03:10:37,100 --> 03:10:44,739
Just don't make a mistake, bro. 12 minute boss fight. Don't make any mistakes, sir.

556
03:10:58,489 --> 03:11:50,280
I think I just jumped off the camera, yeah? Computer reactions.

557
03:12:38,549 --> 03:12:39,590
Sweep every time.

558
03:12:42,389 --> 03:12:47,739
I gotta back up a little. Not a great trade there.

559
03:12:48,459 --> 03:12:57,379
Oh, I got a bad start here. I gotta get back into this shit.

560
03:12:59,940 --> 03:13:07,379
No, I thought it was the spin. It's just so easy to get caught up and get hit by one of those.

561
03:13:07,379 --> 03:13:08,659
They both have the same wind up.

562
03:13:40,709 --> 03:13:44,469
Eight fucking goids. Oh yeah, crouch. Please crouch. Yeah, can I disable that fucking button?

563
03:13:45,270 --> 03:13:53,719
How do I- I'm gonna disable crouch. Seriously. I'm gonna disable it. It's so easy to press it.

564
03:13:56,790 --> 03:13:59,750
Like, why the fuck is this even a thing in the game? Like, get rid of it. I don't want it.

565
03:13:59,750 --> 03:14:03,739
No crouch. Get- get the fuck out of here. I can't even unbind it.

566
03:14:14,709 --> 03:14:35,110
No, that doesn't matter. I can't unbind it. Really? I didn't fucking anything else up, right?

567
03:14:37,239 --> 03:14:41,159
Yeah. Like, get that fucking off my bar. So unnecessary.

568
03:14:47,850 --> 03:14:51,129
Every time it's at the little palm block, it's a thrust.

569
03:14:52,790 --> 03:15:03,350
Crouch. I've used crouch like three times in the 45 hours I played this game.

570
03:15:19,670 --> 03:15:37,899
No, I fucking ran into it. Man. I fucking thought it- ugh.

571
03:15:47,899 --> 03:15:58,120
Because of that whole third- I don't even know what he does. That's the worst part about this

572
03:15:58,120 --> 03:16:04,600
fan is just grinding to fucking get to the third bubble. To see the new move. That's going to

573
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:11,020
instantly kill me. Fucking government project. It really is. I swear to God.

574
03:16:13,379 --> 03:16:47,129
Like, see how susceptible they are. Fucking repetition. I tried to jump,

575
03:16:47,129 --> 03:16:49,129
but the fucking fat ass finger just hit the button.

576
03:17:04,979 --> 03:17:08,899
That was quick right off the bat. Whatever. I got nine of these fucking things.

577
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:24,250
Mistake. That was a mistake. I gotta run.

578
03:17:24,250 --> 03:18:01,819
What? How did I not parry that? I wish that jump follow-up would work, like, even half the time.

579
03:18:24,409 --> 03:18:26,170
Dodge instead of what I wanted to do.

580
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:39,139
Sometimes I forget I'm playing from. Every button is the same button software.

581
03:18:41,350 --> 03:18:47,590
From soft from every fucking- there's three actions on one button. Am I playing red dead?

582
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:18,700
That was fucking dog shit. Dog shit is what we call it.

583
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:29,100
We'll just do this until you stop.

584
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:59,159
What? Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Every single ledge in the game. Every single one.

585
03:19:59,159 --> 03:20:04,040
Go back and watch every vaude. Every single ledge you can't run off of. It stops you. You have to

586
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:14,469
jump. I just walked off that one. No fucking way. I even tested it. I was running into the fucking

587
03:20:14,469 --> 03:20:24,979
wall like an hour ago. I don't have any gourds left. Oh, that's so fucking stupid. Why can you

588
03:20:24,979 --> 03:20:32,020
even walk off the edge here? Of all things to add to this encounter, being able to fall off the

589
03:20:32,020 --> 03:21:03,860
fucking edge. Right now I'm in like phase three or some shit. I'm screaming right now. I mean,

590
03:21:03,860 --> 03:21:08,500
I could use my pellets, but this is- I'm dead here. I'm gonna- he's gonna come and just smash me.

591
03:21:25,770 --> 03:21:33,059
Really? I can't believe that. Now we're at the edge again. Make sure you don't walk off the edge.

592
03:21:50,940 --> 03:21:56,139
My posture's recovering so slowly right now. Fucking god damn it, man.

593
03:21:56,139 --> 03:22:24,899
You know, they're gonna make a game somehow harder than this one, and then nobody will play it.

594
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:35,799
They're gonna keep going until there's no way you can beat it. The next game from From Software

595
03:22:35,799 --> 03:22:50,680
makes, uh, it might be, it might be like times five. Because blood- all right, remember Bloodborne?

596
03:22:50,680 --> 03:22:56,680
Everyone's like, holy shit, Bloodborne is crazy. And then everyone- but here's the next part, right?

597
03:22:56,680 --> 03:23:00,840
Once everybody figures out how to play this game, and more than two weeks go by,

598
03:23:01,239 --> 03:23:06,200
we'll figure out every little cheese, everything to do. It's- you have to learn how to parry, right?

599
03:23:07,319 --> 03:23:14,600
But man, going from iFrames to this, holy shit, it's like completely different. You have to

600
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:19,639
relearn an entire new video game. Like, not even just a new video game, but like, an entirely new

601
03:23:19,639 --> 03:23:27,059
thinking. A lot of games don't even come close with the kind of mechanics that are here,

602
03:23:27,059 --> 03:23:33,620
in regards to how it feels. It's fucking amazing! This is fucking awesome! But my goodness,

603
03:23:33,620 --> 03:23:38,739
does it take a lot to fucking forget everything you've ever learned? Playing most of your games.

604
03:23:52,340 --> 03:23:57,620
I- seriously, I got- my reaction times just went to shit right there. I was waiting for it.

605
03:24:07,079 --> 03:24:13,049
You're not supposed to beat this dude in one night. You're supposed to come back like six

606
03:24:13,049 --> 03:24:17,770
times and beat this guy. You're supposed to play it blank and process the fucking encounter.

607
03:24:23,450 --> 03:25:50,100
Let's go. That's all I did? It's back to healed. Whoa, whoa, hold on here. What was that? I got

608
03:25:50,100 --> 03:25:51,940
like- that was strange. It like turned me around.

609
03:26:48,100 --> 03:26:52,020
That back pull, fuck that. Oh, come yoooon.

610
03:27:38,969 --> 03:27:40,090
More of this fucking combo?

611
03:28:05,299 --> 03:28:09,139
All right, what the fuck have we got now? I've got to see it. I gotta revive.

612
03:28:26,329 --> 03:29:00,979
Didn't get it? It didn't get it. I didn't get it. Risky, but it worth it. No, I thought he was doing

613
03:29:00,979 --> 03:29:16,569
the thing. No, what? He did it twice in a fucking row. How am I not getting this? Fuck you. This

614
03:29:16,569 --> 03:29:48,540
is not- this is- I got- no, I thought it was the lightning move again. No, it was- I thought it

615
03:29:48,540 --> 03:30:04,329
was the lightning move. Fuck, man. No. I thought he was doing for the lightning and I'm just gonna

616
03:30:04,329 --> 03:30:13,100
try and time it. You have to jump so much later than he does. Oh, painful. Painful, painful,

617
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:25,639
painful, painful. I got- come on. That was the best attempt all night. Oh, trying, guys. I really am.

618
03:30:26,540 --> 03:31:02,309
I'm trying. I promise. I'm trying. Okay, come on, man. I gotta use the buffs? Yeah, but the thing is,

619
03:31:04,389 --> 03:31:12,360
duh. They take like a couple seconds to work and knowing me, I'm gonna use them and get hit

620
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:30,549
by something and die. I know me. Well, that was dumb. I'm still like fucking shook up from that

621
03:31:30,549 --> 03:31:42,889
last one. See if I can get a decent attempt here. No, I'm getting too close, I think.

622
03:31:45,370 --> 03:33:10,260
I just teleported into one. Let's just use one now. Back up, back up. Not worth it. It's bad.

623
03:33:11,379 --> 03:33:27,350
No, man. I have no way. I- I couldn't get up. Fuck me. That combo, you gotta just run away.

624
03:33:27,350 --> 03:33:46,889
You can't be stopped. This one right here, man. It's just no fucking way.

625
03:33:46,889 --> 03:33:58,540
It's really neat. When he does that, like, he does like four or five moves in a row,

626
03:33:58,540 --> 03:34:15,579
and even if you parry him, you're just dead. You have to just run. Next time. Just gotta relax.

627
03:34:27,750 --> 03:34:38,680
Whoops. I fat-fingered that. Yeah, I fucked it up. My hands are like covered in fucking water

628
03:34:38,680 --> 03:34:49,379
right now. I gotta like fucking wipe them off with something. This controller is fucking filthy.

629
03:34:53,049 --> 03:35:04,659
I'm gonna get him. I'll beat him. Positive thoughts only here. Only positive vibes today.

630
03:35:04,659 --> 03:35:06,739
That's not true. I've been fucking talking shit this whole time.

631
03:35:10,340 --> 03:35:35,239
I thought that, uh, getting sloppy. Not really actually getting sloppy. Like, for real getting

632
03:35:35,239 --> 03:35:53,989
sloppy. I'm still a lightning run from that fucking lightning run. Yeah, look at me. My,

633
03:35:53,989 --> 03:36:15,899
like, body is, like, nerves up. Just making mistakes. Let's go. Bad. I have six heals left.

634
03:36:24,950 --> 03:36:53,209
I'm fucked here. Nope, okay. Oh, fuck. No. I just jumped preemptively like an idiot.

635
03:36:54,010 --> 03:37:11,129
No, no, no, no. This first phase fucks me every time. Seriously. Now he's back to fucking zero posture again.

636
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:37,139
It's slowing down. I gotta fucking. Couple more tries, and then I'm gonna grab some water.

637
03:37:42,170 --> 03:37:51,260
Damn. I'm gonna grab some water. I'm gonna slam like 16 outs, and I'm gonna come up fair.

638
03:37:51,260 --> 03:37:53,500
Did you ever lied about Minecraft fair? Thanks for the five community subs.

639
03:37:54,139 --> 03:37:57,180
Thank you so much. Every stream has seen me give subs, dude. Thank you.

640
03:37:58,379 --> 03:38:16,649
That's not it. Oh, I keep, you know, I never see him do that, so that's why I keep getting

641
03:38:17,370 --> 03:38:51,770
me. I usually. It's all right, just get the fuck out. Sloppy.

642
03:39:01,180 --> 03:39:06,059
That combo gets me every single time, and he starts off with it every time, man.

643
03:39:06,059 --> 03:39:09,579
That, like, one, one, two, three. And snap, I never parry it.

644
03:39:34,739 --> 03:39:39,139
I didn't dodge that. How is that fucking possible? I looked like I did.

645
03:39:46,809 --> 03:40:04,170
God, that was not what I thought it was. I almost got fucking hit by that, too.

646
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:15,420
That, look at how far away I was.

647
03:40:30,040 --> 03:40:36,229
See, there it is, man. There it is. No, no way can you stop that. It's not. No way. No way.

648
03:40:36,229 --> 03:41:48,260
Even if you want to parry everything. No fucking way. Clean, too. Real clean.

649
03:41:59,290 --> 03:42:16,059
Back it up. Don't stay in here. Don't stay in. No reason to. This is bullshit.

650
03:42:16,620 --> 03:42:39,860
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin. Let's do it. I'm ready. What do you mean? What's wrong with the

651
03:42:39,860 --> 03:43:07,579
audio? There's a buzzing sound? What? Are we good? All right. Here we go. Here we go. Stupid

652
03:43:07,579 --> 03:43:14,940
fucking mouse. Oh my God. Get the mouse off the screen. Why can I not? Oh my fucking God.

653
03:43:14,940 --> 03:44:19,340
Why is this even a thing? I thought I was. No, no. God damn it, Jeremy. Fuck you.

654
03:44:20,379 --> 03:46:15,379
I got no opportunity. I have to just fucking go. Yes. He's dead. Yes. Fuck you. Wait, no.

655
03:46:16,180 --> 03:46:30,809
Face four. He's face four. I can't move. No, face. I don't care. Just give me the credits.

656
03:46:47,110 --> 03:47:06,649
Oh, that was fucking crazy. Damn, what a fucking game. Initial P thanks to the five community subs.

657
03:47:08,280 --> 03:47:14,180
Oh, I could like cry right now. God damn it, man. That was fucking crazy.

658
03:47:19,379 --> 03:47:31,879
One fucking mistake. Your body just gets so, so beside itself. Okay, here we go. Let's read this.

659
03:47:31,879 --> 03:47:34,520
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf.

660
03:47:35,079 --> 03:47:39,399
Commune with a sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle for attack power. At his peak,

661
03:47:40,040 --> 03:47:44,920
Ishina Ashina devoted himself to deadly conflict in pursuit of strength, a single-minded killing

662
03:47:44,920 --> 03:48:04,790
machine of a man. Dragon Flash. Oh, all right. So I'll tell you, Mike, you want to talk about

663
03:48:04,790 --> 03:48:09,829
like a final rating for the game? We're at like an eight seven last night, right? Yesterday.

664
03:48:13,690 --> 03:48:24,360
That fight was so ridiculous. I had, I think that bumped it up to a nine. I hated that,

665
03:48:24,360 --> 03:48:34,889
but I loved it at the same time. Oh, it's so exhilarating. I think that I think I get,

666
03:48:34,889 --> 03:48:42,500
I think I'm going to give this a nine. In his younger years, Ishina was a devil with the

667
03:48:42,500 --> 03:48:47,379
sword, spending his days in pursuit of life or death combat. He often ruminated on how a cut

668
03:48:47,379 --> 03:48:52,180
should be made, but his blade always moved first. He ain't going to get up, right? Is that,

669
03:48:52,180 --> 03:49:00,700
he's not going to like stand up and turn into an ape. Look, bucko, we don't want to hear your life

670
03:49:00,700 --> 03:49:08,819
story. I did it. I did it. Yes. I was, I had some thoughts there that maybe not. You know,

671
03:49:08,819 --> 03:49:14,420
I was getting a lot of self-doubt halfway through that fight. And I'm just sitting there going,

672
03:49:14,420 --> 03:49:23,540
oh, am I going to be, am I going to be one of the people like the, is there anything else I can do?

673
03:49:29,370 --> 03:49:34,329
Oh man. It feels so good to just know that it's over. Well, not, oh, well, not that I,

674
03:49:34,329 --> 03:49:54,680
I'm glad the game is over, but that fight is over. You okay, Kuro? Give divine dragons tear.

675
03:49:55,319 --> 03:50:14,739
I mean, I have it here. Your side. Oh, it's ridiculous. I can't even get over it.

676
03:50:18,440 --> 03:50:23,079
Take the dragon tears. I can't wait to play Picross for like another hour or two. We're coming down

677
03:50:23,079 --> 03:50:28,440
hard here, guys. I'm going to come down and play Picross and just hang out.

678
03:50:55,770 --> 03:51:18,389
Now sever these ties of immortality. Well, that kid's a bad-ass, not even like a,

679
03:51:19,590 --> 03:51:57,659
wait, wait, wait, what? I become the sculptor now? I think it is best that you have this.

680
03:51:58,299 --> 03:52:13,500
What is that? No doubt the day will come when a shinobi arrives seeking strength.

681
03:52:14,780 --> 03:52:34,860
Oh, the cycle just repeats. So wait, what? So I, was I the sculptor? You are the sculptor. So you,

682
03:52:34,860 --> 03:52:49,579
the shinobi then shows up and you do the whole thing again. Well, I got the two snake hearts,

683
03:52:49,579 --> 03:52:59,350
but I didn't use them apparently. It's the same story as Dark Souls.

684
03:53:03,350 --> 03:53:14,250
Oh, that was exhilarating. It was, I had a, I said a lot. I talked a lot of shit,

685
03:53:14,250 --> 03:53:23,319
but it was venting. I hope you guys understand that because that was truly like a fucking ridiculous

686
03:53:23,319 --> 03:53:34,760
experience. Here's the, you know what? I'm going to tell you something right now.

687
03:53:36,819 --> 03:53:40,420
They're going to have to do something. Is anything going to be able to,

688
03:53:40,420 --> 03:53:47,899
I feel like every other video game is, let me turn this down. After playing through Sekiro,

689
03:53:47,899 --> 03:54:03,239
I feel like every other video game is just not even going to be easy. No more video games can

690
03:54:03,239 --> 03:54:15,350
be made. Video games are easy now. I'm going to be so spoiled rotten. I'm going to go play another

691
03:54:15,350 --> 03:54:21,030
game and it's going to be like, this is not as hard as Sekiro. This is easy. I'm just, I'm ruined

692
03:54:21,030 --> 03:54:39,260
forever. No, but for all my venting complaints, frustrations, that was, that was fantastic.

693
03:54:42,329 --> 03:54:52,809
I am very, very happy to have that experience. I think some of these bosses, a couple of them

694
03:54:52,809 --> 03:54:58,500
were probably my favorites of the whole series, just in the way that they're, you play them.

695
03:55:03,940 --> 03:55:11,190
Ludwig from Bloodborne is my favorite boss ever made, but I would probably say

696
03:55:11,909 --> 03:55:23,690
that the ape, the first time you fight the ape was just crazy. That was so cool. It was really

697
03:55:23,690 --> 03:55:29,770
kind of out there and frustrating, but it was, the guardian ape was a very interesting, cool encounter.

698
03:55:30,329 --> 03:55:45,540
Sekiro isn't a Soulsborne though, I know. The owl fight was awesome. Even some of the, just the

699
03:55:45,540 --> 03:55:53,750
mini bosses were really, really interesting too. Kill Demon of Hatred, I did. I did that before this.

700
03:55:58,520 --> 03:56:03,479
How would you rank it compared to Dark Souls 1 through 3? Well, it's kind of not fair to make

701
03:56:03,479 --> 03:56:10,389
that comparison though, because they're just not the same. It's, Bloodborne I think is my favorite

702
03:56:10,389 --> 03:56:18,280
still, but that's, I'm so biased for Bloodborne. It's like one of my favorite games ever made

703
03:56:18,280 --> 03:56:30,469
of all time. It might even be my favorite game ever made, but Sekiro is probably, I think it's,

704
03:56:33,639 --> 03:56:41,450
I think it's better than Dark Souls 3, just in regards to, but it's also new and Dark Souls 3

705
03:56:41,450 --> 03:56:48,540
really did kind of feel like they really wanted to end that series. So I loved Dark Souls 3,

706
03:56:48,540 --> 03:56:56,420
but I think this is probably a better game than Dark Souls 3 in regards to just overall package.

707
03:56:59,879 --> 03:57:03,479
I think it's better than Dark Souls 3, but I think it's not as good as Bloodborne.

708
03:57:03,479 --> 03:57:08,379
I'm very biased on that. Bloodborne is a full straight up 10 out of 10 for me.

709
03:57:13,850 --> 03:57:16,809
With or without the DLC for Dark Souls 3? The DLC in Dark Souls 3 was cool.

710
03:57:17,370 --> 03:57:32,219
The ice area was really cool. Was the game harder as a whole? I think so, because this game forces

711
03:57:32,219 --> 03:57:38,379
you to play the game the way that they want you to play it. In all the Dark Souls and Soulsborne

712
03:57:38,379 --> 03:57:44,040
games, you can approach any situation however you want. You can put on a full set of armor,

713
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:47,879
you can get a hide behind a shield, you can use eye frames, you can do eye frame abuse,

714
03:57:49,190 --> 03:57:53,350
you can build a certain character based on one-shotting bosses. You can't do that here.

715
03:57:54,149 --> 03:57:58,469
You can go grind souls and go over level for a boss. Can't do that here either.

716
03:57:59,030 --> 03:58:04,920
So I think this is much harder than any of the Souls games, just because you could build an

717
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:13,909
entire character and grind to beat any boss in like three hits. So in that regard, I think this is

718
03:58:13,909 --> 03:58:18,469
five to ten times harder than any of the Souls games. Not because the game is harder, but because

719
03:58:18,469 --> 03:58:23,909
you can't play it the way that you want. You have to play this game. You have to do it the way that

720
03:58:23,909 --> 03:58:39,049
they want you to. And if you don't, you're dead. Good, see you later. I don't like the overleveling

721
03:58:39,049 --> 03:58:43,620
shit. I think this game makes for better bosses and balance. That's true, but you also, you have

722
03:58:43,620 --> 03:58:48,819
to understand though, is a lot of people kind of just want to play it. And if something's really

723
03:58:48,819 --> 03:58:55,020
too fucking hard, like sometimes you'll hit a wall and it's just like, I can't, and no summoning,

724
03:58:55,020 --> 03:59:02,940
no co-op. How many people do you know that played through the Dark Souls games that had to do bosses

725
03:59:02,940 --> 03:59:20,309
with partners? You can't, do you have to, you have to play a bunch of casuals. Yeah, but like I said,

726
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:25,000
when I was in the middle of this last fight, what's the percentage of people that are going to

727
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:30,709
beat that? What, has somebody said that the demon of hatred was what, six percent of players that

728
03:59:30,709 --> 03:59:38,629
have the game on Steam that have that achievement? That's not very much. That is so small of a

729
03:59:38,629 --> 03:59:43,510
percentage of people that have the game. And it did just come up, that's true, but I don't think

730
03:59:43,510 --> 03:59:52,250
that number will get any more than, I don't think that number will go higher than like 20 or 30 percent.

731
03:59:52,250 --> 03:59:59,110
It's about two percent for Isshin right now. Wow. So, I mean, so yeah, I know, I know the philosophy

732
03:59:59,110 --> 04:00:05,500
is get good, get good, but maybe some people don't really want to. You know, what if you only have

733
04:00:05,500 --> 04:00:10,069
like a couple hours to like really sit down and play a game? You know, oh, I just got off of work

734
04:00:10,069 --> 04:00:19,510
and I got to grind and get good. It can be hard. So that's why stuff like the co-op, having a friend

735
04:00:19,510 --> 04:00:25,750
come in and play with like a party, being able to overlevel yourself just to kind of play it.

736
04:00:25,750 --> 04:00:30,780
Now you could say, well, that's not the way the game is supposed to be played, but judging by

737
04:00:30,780 --> 04:00:42,069
the percentages that you see, some people have to do it like that. But in all those regards, all

738
04:00:42,069 --> 04:00:47,049
those things that we talked about, that's why this game I think is much harder. It has nothing

739
04:00:47,049 --> 04:00:50,649
really to do with like the game's physical mechanics as much as you have to play the way

740
04:00:50,649 --> 04:00:57,370
the game tells you to. No friends, no fucking item abuse, no iFrame abuse. You've got to fucking do

741
04:00:57,370 --> 04:01:04,360
it. And it can be very frustrating, very, listen to me talking, very frustrating. All right. If you

742
04:01:04,360 --> 04:01:09,819
choose to start playthrough two now, you may do so by accessing the large sculptor's idol in the...

743
04:01:09,819 --> 04:01:21,379
Um, is there anything left I could do? Or that's a new game plus. Well, I'm not going to start it

744
04:01:22,870 --> 04:01:34,760
now. Oh, there are other headlesses. Oh, he's still alive. You're still alive. Well, let me

745
04:01:34,760 --> 04:01:50,069
bring everybody back to life one more time. Oh, there we go. Start playthrough two. Isshina Isshina

746
04:01:50,069 --> 04:01:59,000
at 2% is the bad ending. Not Sword Saint Isshina, who is at 8%. Okay, that's still very little.

747
04:01:59,639 --> 04:02:19,979
There's an optional boss in the estate. Let me see. 221 total deaths. 52 deaths at Isshin. Damn.

748
04:02:22,139 --> 04:02:33,340
52. That's so many. I can't believe I kept my fucking composure and kept going. So 220.

749
04:02:36,340 --> 04:02:43,719
God, how did you guys put up with me for that long? Seriously. I hope I wasn't too fucking

750
04:02:43,719 --> 04:02:51,100
obnoxious during that. Seriously. I can imagine I would be, I was probably so fucking annoying.

751
04:02:51,739 --> 04:03:09,139
I hate doing that, but it's just frustration coming out. I don't mean fucking any of it.

752
04:03:09,940 --> 04:03:26,059
I muted you for a while. I'm sorry. It was fucking fun though. Isshina, if you gotta do

753
04:03:26,059 --> 04:03:31,020
what you gotta do. Thanks for still sticking around and watching though. Appreciate that.

754
04:03:31,020 --> 04:03:40,260
I had to get good and I tried and I did. So 220 deaths. I was gonna do a scratch ticket

755
04:03:40,340 --> 04:03:48,579
for every death. I'm not buying 220 $1 scratch tickets. That'll take two weeks to scratch them.

756
04:03:50,680 --> 04:03:55,079
So we're gonna do like fives or something. Yeah, we'll do five. Wait, hold on. How many is that?

757
04:03:56,170 --> 04:04:03,530
That's still a ton. What about $10 tickets? The higher the denomination goes, guys,

758
04:04:03,530 --> 04:04:10,889
the more chance to win. You don't win shit with a $1 scratch ticket. No, I'm not gonna scratch

759
04:04:11,129 --> 04:04:18,819
220 tickets. Do you understand how stupid that is? That'll take two or three straight streams.

760
04:04:18,819 --> 04:04:32,780
That's gonna be like 15 hours. 22 $10 tickets and one $1 ticket or $44, $5. Depends. Now I still

761
04:04:32,780 --> 04:04:36,459
have to make sure that that's like a legal thing to do for Terms of Service because then whatever

762
04:04:36,459 --> 04:04:46,729
happens from there goes into community subs. It's gonna be called secure scratch off for community

763
04:04:46,809 --> 04:04:57,780
subs. It's gonna have to be a whole stream. It really is. That's gonna be the weirdest stream

764
04:05:04,139 --> 04:05:08,299
or charity. Yeah, that's probably a better idea. Whatever I get

765
04:05:08,299 --> 04:05:20,889
from the scratch offs is going right to charity. That's better. All right, I think that's it for

766
04:05:20,889 --> 04:05:29,979
this gambling for charity for securo death. People are gonna stumble into that stream and just be

767
04:05:29,979 --> 04:05:37,139
like, what the fuck is this guy doing? Oh, right, right, there's a boss apparently that I missed.

768
04:05:37,139 --> 04:05:50,739
Let's just go look at it. Dude, imagine if I won like 50 grand. That would be an awesome charitable

769
04:05:50,739 --> 04:05:58,940
donation there. Imagine winning like 100 grand on one of those tickets. Did you do the ape fights?

770
04:05:58,940 --> 04:06:12,870
Yeah, I did both of them. But there was one here, right? Let me just take a look. It won't be as

771
04:06:12,870 --> 04:06:21,219
weird as the labo streams. What? Why are the labo streams weird? Just because I got shit faced and

772
04:06:21,219 --> 04:06:27,450
started like karate kicking the camera. All right, let me I'm gonna just run around. I know

773
04:06:27,450 --> 04:06:40,409
there was something. Is that weird? Or is that just like a Saturday, you know? Oh, no, it's with the

774
04:06:41,049 --> 04:06:53,909
the flute guys, right? Do the lake headless. I did the lake headless already, didn't I?

775
04:06:54,549 --> 04:07:11,989
The one that was in the water there. The dog just killed me. I don't think I'm in the right spot.

776
04:07:17,540 --> 04:07:25,739
I think it's a different one. Flower viewing, great sakura.

777
04:07:27,450 --> 04:07:35,030
No, it is this one. Oh, 222 scratch sticks. No, we don't let's don't count anymore. 221.

778
04:07:49,290 --> 04:07:55,129
My like my like relaxation is starting to like kick in. I'm like, oh, oh, it's I did it.

779
04:07:55,770 --> 04:08:12,149
What a fucking tough game. Uh, where are we going? Did I fight Owl? Yeah, I think I did all the

780
04:08:12,149 --> 04:08:24,260
optional like major bosses. Now, I feel like because I ran through this. Scrooge.

781
04:08:25,059 --> 04:08:39,420
Scrooge, what the fuck is happening? Oh, oh, yeah, I rage unbounded. Why can I not? No,

782
04:08:39,420 --> 04:08:50,420
that's the wrong one. Oh, what a psycho. God, I hate being like rage streamer. Like, I don't like it,

783
04:08:50,979 --> 04:08:55,659
but it's all right. Sometimes you have to have some of those moments. Where uh, where is this guy?

784
04:08:56,219 --> 04:09:17,530
I think there's only, no, just this guy, that guy. Oh, no, they're lightning. They're lightning.

785
04:09:39,659 --> 04:10:02,010
Oh, I probably can just run through this to be honest. Yeah, dude. Okay, for people that just

786
04:10:02,010 --> 04:10:08,229
came here, I can't do it. I've been stuck here for two straight days. The stealth section is so

787
04:10:08,229 --> 04:10:15,750
irritating. I can't fucking do it. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. It's just so

788
04:10:15,750 --> 04:10:34,069
fucked up, man. Right. Okay, so I didn't wait a minute. Did I go down here? Yeah, I don't think

789
04:10:34,069 --> 04:10:55,059
I'm going to be able to complete this. Oh, it's a gourd seed. Relax. That was weird. I really got

790
04:10:55,059 --> 04:11:27,340
clipped inside of him. First impression, I don't like the stealth part. Doesn't like stealth in a

791
04:11:27,340 --> 04:11:39,190
samurai game. I don't like this part. I don't like it. Stop banning people. Somebody actually, I

792
04:11:39,190 --> 04:11:45,030
didn't mention it because I was just kind of, I was kind of tilted during the last fight, last boss,

793
04:11:45,909 --> 04:11:53,829
but somebody said, I'm going to paraphrase it here, but they said, damn, he's getting so salty.

794
04:11:53,829 --> 04:12:07,690
I wonder if he's going to actually start banning people. You know, like look over and see somebody

795
04:12:07,690 --> 04:12:12,809
be like, oh, dude, you suck. It's already salty. When is he going to start to actually ban somebody?

796
04:12:12,809 --> 04:12:19,290
Never done that before. We make jokes on this channel all the time about, oh yeah, like get

797
04:12:19,290 --> 04:12:24,489
banned. It's a permanent ban. And it's like 10 seconds, right? It's a joke. I've never done that

798
04:12:24,489 --> 04:12:44,059
before. Imagine just getting so upset and just so just tilted and raged that like somebody says

799
04:12:44,059 --> 04:12:49,659
something that I just like fucking shut up and like ban somebody. No, I don't know if it would

800
04:12:49,659 --> 04:12:57,819
ever get there. That's the thing. I don't, whenever I get upset at a game, I don't take it out on other

801
04:12:57,819 --> 04:13:04,809
people. I take it out on like myself mostly. Like I'll say like, what the fuck? What an idiot. Like

802
04:13:04,809 --> 04:13:13,739
I was a bad move, but I don't think I would ever like be so angry that I would like tell like a

803
04:13:13,739 --> 04:13:18,700
viewer like, dude, you're wrong. Shut the fuck up. Like I don't, I don't know. I don't know why I

804
04:13:18,700 --> 04:13:43,879
would do that. Have I ever been banned? It's like from you mean from a chat? Uh, um, I know. I don't

805
04:13:43,879 --> 04:13:58,139
think so. All right. This is the place that I didn't go to this. Oh my God. He's looking over

806
04:13:58,139 --> 04:14:07,139
here. No, we're fine. Um, this is good. Will this work? Cause I feel like I'm going to do this and

807
04:14:07,139 --> 04:14:16,500
then I got to put the shuriken on. Cause all right. If you get to that point, right? Let's say you get

808
04:14:16,500 --> 04:14:21,059
to a point where you're really actually starting to get mad at viewers and like telling people

809
04:14:21,059 --> 04:14:24,739
like to fuck off and shouldn't start banning people. The cycle is just going to go on. It's

810
04:14:24,739 --> 04:14:29,940
going to be horrible because nobody likes to hear that. Like, you know, I need, nobody wants to be

811
04:14:29,940 --> 04:14:34,899
told like, Hey, shut the fuck up guys. It's like, Whoa, come on man. And then all of a sudden,

812
04:14:36,420 --> 04:14:41,540
like people start to get angry at you being angry at them and then they get angry at you and you

813
04:14:41,540 --> 04:14:58,040
start to, it just cascades. All right. So I didn't go over here last time. That's why even if I do

814
04:14:58,040 --> 04:15:01,479
like look over and see something that somebody says, something that's like mean or something,

815
04:15:02,200 --> 04:15:08,100
for the most part, I know that people are just fucking around and I wouldn't want to like

816
04:15:08,100 --> 04:15:11,780
escalate something just because somebody was like, dude, you like kind of suck at this. It's like,

817
04:15:11,860 --> 04:15:31,180
yeah. All right. All right. Whatever. Because I know a large portion of why I'm upset is

818
04:15:31,180 --> 04:15:38,889
because I'm not doing well, right? So if I looked over right now and saw, holy shit, you suck.

819
04:15:39,780 --> 04:15:47,979
It's like, Hey, I suck. Hey, fuck you. It's like, you know, jokey. But when you're mad,

820
04:15:47,979 --> 04:15:53,100
when you're angry and you look over, there's a very high chance that that same message,

821
04:15:54,149 --> 04:15:59,270
instead of making you laugh, we'll be like, I don't even know what it's like. It's hard. This

822
04:15:59,270 --> 04:16:06,090
is a fucking hard game. And no, you're, you're wrong. But I obviously never want to get to that

823
04:16:06,090 --> 04:16:11,610
point because I like to have fun here and not like get fucking pissed off and like hate streaming or

824
04:16:11,610 --> 04:16:20,840
something. We didn't ask for your life story. Yeah, you did. All right. Where is this thing

825
04:16:20,840 --> 04:16:28,059
that I'm supposed to be finding? This is the only place I didn't really explore. I like sprinted

826
04:16:28,059 --> 04:16:50,840
through it after I didn't play. I'm looking for the boss. There's a boss somewhere around here.

827
04:16:50,840 --> 04:17:05,190
That's what somebody told me at least. Go to the idol and take a left. I've already cleared so much.

828
04:17:17,299 --> 04:17:45,829
Well, it was cool to see everything. Ooh, wait. I think I found it. It's right there. That's the

829
04:17:45,829 --> 04:17:50,069
noise. Okay. That's the noise that was, remember we were over here before and everyone was

830
04:17:50,709 --> 04:17:59,209
monkey. There was like a bunch of monkey from the loud noises. So I have to go around this building.

831
04:17:59,209 --> 04:18:09,750
So it really is just kind of to the right here. The great Lord Walden just gave 20 community subs.

832
04:18:12,729 --> 04:18:30,870
Thank you. Great Lord Walden. That's an insane amount of subs. Thank you. I think I missed

833
04:18:30,870 --> 04:18:35,639
bits and shit too, during that whole process. I'm sorry if I missed like a lot of money.

834
04:18:35,639 --> 04:18:38,920
Did I beat the game? I did. I'm just kind of going back and cleaning up some stuff just to see it.

835
04:18:42,500 --> 04:19:14,020
So this is not the right idol. What is the idol? It's this one. No, it is. It is. Okay, I'm on the

836
04:19:14,020 --> 04:19:39,049
roof. Wasn't it like right here? No, it's this way. Right? It's like straight ahead here.

837
04:19:39,850 --> 04:20:11,450
No, that's not it. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Five more community subs. Thank you. I feel like

838
04:20:11,450 --> 04:20:25,399
I've done it completely wrong. Have I lost my goddamn mind? There's none. It's right here.

839
04:20:25,399 --> 04:20:47,979
So the idol's right there. The bowl is right here. Here? I'm sorry. I'm like, I know he's like

840
04:20:47,979 --> 04:21:00,100
right here somewhere. Here? I found it. Right here. Oh, Jesus. Okay. I thought he was caged up.

841
04:21:00,100 --> 04:21:11,770
He's just free to be here out on the bright side. I wish I found this earlier. That's a lot of money.

842
04:21:11,770 --> 04:21:19,270
Okay, well, he says he has terror shit on his head. So let's, let's get that out of the way.

843
04:21:19,270 --> 04:21:43,180
Let's see. Did he just shoot an arrow at me? Somebody is shooting an arrow at me. Oh, right.

844
04:21:44,059 --> 04:21:52,340
The guy up on the roof. Okay. Well, maybe I gotta clear the roof then before I do this.

845
04:21:53,299 --> 04:22:19,659
It's pretty clear at this point. Maybe not. Oh, here comes another lottery ticket. What am I

846
04:22:19,659 --> 04:22:30,059
doing? I have no, it's not even. You don't count as a beast? Why did it not work the first time?

847
04:22:31,270 --> 04:22:36,389
Really? You're not a beast? Bullshit. You're a fucking animal. You're an animal.

848
04:22:53,719 --> 04:23:06,540
Probably should start parrying these things. Just dodge.

849
04:23:20,469 --> 04:24:20,500
No, not a place I want to be. Ow. Come here. Come here, dog. Oh, out of gorge. He's out of gorge.

850
04:24:21,139 --> 04:24:34,700
That really isn't even any terror. Oops. Okay. I'm getting really, really dumb here. Oh, I'm getting

851
04:24:34,700 --> 04:25:18,459
real dumb. Round and round we go. Just stay right up his ass. Oh, he kind of popped me there.

852
04:25:33,829 --> 04:25:39,190
Oh my God. I just looked over at chat. I saw somebody say Thanos. Well, what the fuck am I

853
04:25:39,190 --> 04:25:58,309
doing, man? I just got like, I keep giving him such a good opportunity to hit me, to stay behind him.

854
04:26:11,110 --> 04:26:54,840
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh, that hurts. Hi, Gorgi. Oh, that would have been nice. That would

855
04:26:54,840 --> 04:26:58,280
have been nice to have. What is it? 16? That's not really that big of a deal. Cool. All right.

856
04:27:04,250 --> 04:27:13,110
Well, hold on. I can get this. Finally beat the palace. No, guys, I'm just grinding.

857
04:27:14,469 --> 04:27:28,469
I can't do it. The boss in here? No, I'm just trying to grind for beads. I did. Okay,

858
04:27:28,469 --> 04:27:36,139
I'm talking about areas. This area was my favorite. Not that part over there. Like, not that part.

859
04:27:36,139 --> 04:27:39,260
This part. Not that actually. Not this part either. That not the stealth part.

860
04:27:39,899 --> 04:27:45,159
The part where you walk down the mountain. So pretty much this is not my favorite zone. I just

861
04:27:45,159 --> 04:27:53,819
like the way it looks. Worst area, in my opinion, just in regards to how hard it was for me to do.

862
04:27:54,870 --> 04:28:07,930
That optional zone leading up to the demon of hatred. It just was kind of brutal going through

863
04:28:07,930 --> 04:28:14,420
that. And I'm trying to think of other areas that I had just trouble with.

864
04:28:22,920 --> 04:28:28,280
This area was hard to do and it was kind of frustrating with the weird lightning guys and

865
04:28:28,280 --> 04:28:42,409
people kicking the ball at you. But I don't know if this is the worst area. Well, I'm here. I might

866
04:28:42,409 --> 04:29:11,270
as well just try. Isn't there a headless down here? Yeah, they're right here. Ow. You actually

867
04:29:11,270 --> 04:29:29,209
don't really need confetti here, huh? I'm gonna use that. Tag team headless. You know, before,

868
04:29:30,950 --> 04:29:33,989
I've already seen the end of the tunnel. This doesn't even bother me anymore.

869
04:29:38,299 --> 04:29:42,540
Nothing can compare to that final fight. Like, it doesn't even matter. This is just like funny

870
04:29:42,540 --> 04:29:58,540
now. This is like, this is a comedy. Whatever this is, I didn't get it. Didn't even use any sugar

871
04:29:58,540 --> 04:30:06,809
or anything. I was just, I remember, I'm, you see, the last boss and even the demon of hatred.

872
04:30:07,450 --> 04:30:12,729
Use the items. Use the candy. Use this. Use the, you gotta do it, man. Imagine if I had, if I had

873
04:30:12,729 --> 04:30:22,299
stopped and used like the candy in that third phase thinking I was, I should have, I would have

874
04:30:22,299 --> 04:30:38,020
probably died. My brain is just, my brain is fucking just a mess. All right, so we got this guy.

875
04:30:38,979 --> 04:30:48,790
Now there's how many, how many swings? The yellow one's throwing shit at me now.

876
04:30:51,500 --> 04:31:01,459
Whoa, that goes across the whole place, huh? Um, I wonder if I should kill the

877
04:31:02,100 --> 04:31:14,979
illusion first. Let's see. How hard, how annoying are you? Yeah, you got way less health.

878
04:31:15,860 --> 04:31:42,579
You're just annoying. Okay, all right. I can't take this down here? I can't, oh, I can't use that.

879
04:31:45,110 --> 04:32:19,829
All right, well, no, get out. He's almost dead. There it is. One down. Okay, now I wonder. I'm

880
04:32:19,829 --> 04:32:53,159
already almost dead. They can't respawn, do they? Walls. Boy, I see where I'm at.

881
04:32:59,059 --> 04:33:23,659
Surprise! Oh my god, what am I doing? I'm dead. Goodbye. Actually, I might be able to get it

882
04:33:23,659 --> 04:33:53,880
if he does the grab again. All right, no health. Nooooo! Game sucks. Game sucks. Game sucks. Game

three times yeah he's a stationary target don't you guys understand the people that move the

893
04:37:21,689 --> 04:37:28,299
slowest i may as well just give up you the slower you are the harder you are for me to play in these

894
04:37:28,299 --> 04:37:37,830
games you could telegraph and move for 15 straight like now i'm just getting angry again like these

895
04:37:37,830 --> 04:37:46,009

897
04:38:06,680 --> 04:38:17,209
way around oh fucking headless man this dude's not even hard it's not even hard i'm making it

910
04:42:19,659 --> 04:42:34,060
thinking i'm saying this is precious bait something resembling horns seem to be jutting out of it

911
04:42:34,060 --> 04:42:42,840
just the kind of bait the master loves ring the bell drop the bait what the hell does that mean

915
04:43:57,380 --> 04:44:03,259
grounds and find a way to the roof why don't i just fucking get on the roof right now like this

919
04:44:45,900 --> 04:44:51,659
and for a few seconds right there i was just had 11 000 up i don't know how that happened

920
04:44:52,220 --> 04:45:20,470
that was great gimme up there really okay top of the castle which which side should i get up here

921
04:45:21,430 --> 04:45:37,959
uh you know what let's just skip this shit that i already finished yeah i did i'm just going back

922
04:45:37,959 --> 04:45:56,229
and checking out some of the optional stuff that i missed all right this one this one this one

923
04:45:56,229 --> 04:46:20,200
this one thinks that johnny kich this one says uh main hall which one's at the top

924
04:46:20,200 --> 04:46:29,880
intersect them oh no no no no i'm in the wrong place which one of these great sacra palace

925
04:46:29,880 --> 04:46:40,490
grounds i think palestine pickross isn't going to help this is i can't graduate fourth grade

926
04:46:40,490 --> 04:46:54,779
level mistakes oh okay wait come on all right we're at the top there's like a canister here

927
04:46:54,779 --> 04:47:10,340
put it in here fourth grade what did i walk into your sword no okay i thought for a second that was

928
04:47:11,299 --> 04:47:20,979
i got hit with an arrow all right we're at the top of the palace

929
04:47:24,520 --> 04:47:42,490
so if i'm a place to put bait down there i don't think i did very much exploring over here

930
04:47:42,490 --> 04:48:01,189
like that way how would i can i get up there on the roof i don't think there's a grappling

931
04:48:01,189 --> 04:48:35,430
point up here i'm up here can i make this jump i think i tried this before it didn't work is there

932
04:48:35,430 --> 04:49:04,889
a branch let's see a branch over here but where's the there's no indicator i feel like i'm not you

933
04:49:04,889 --> 04:49:24,740
know i don't see an indicator do i like the cookies the cookies are great i don't think i

934
04:49:24,740 --> 04:49:38,090
could reach that god damn it whatever just quickly that takes so much longer than any other soul

935
04:49:38,970 --> 04:50:02,729
software game okay let's try this again what am i eating uh i went outside and i took a shovel and

936
04:50:02,729 --> 04:50:05,849
i brought some dirt in here and i figured i would chew on it for a while and like swallow it and

937
04:50:05,849 --> 04:50:38,580
shit is your eye is your uh no i'm confused grapple from the bonfire area like back here

05:13:12,020 --> 05:13:38,150
i'm sad i like wish i didn't do that no he's so sad do nothing that's just mean

1011

1012
05:13:54,099 --> 05:14:04,810
a different arena the eighth boss somebody's gonna be washed up down like down here is it gonna be

1013
05:14:04,810 --> 05:14:57,430
so sad oh the other one uh where's the other one uh great white whisker priceless white whisker

1014
05:14:57,430 --> 05:15:03,750
taken from the great colored carp while the great carp is naturally immortal if killed its whiskers

1015
05:15:03,750 --> 05:15:08,389
can be plucked the sound of the whisker being removed is surely magic music to the ears of

1016
05:15:08,389 --> 05:15:13,590
certain people some would feel relief at their sound of their mission being completed others

1017
05:15:13,590 --> 05:15:25,830
the joy of having their heart's desire granted couldn't go in i know it would be really cool

1018
05:15:26,470 --> 05:15:32,009
let me tell you something how from software take a note here if you walked in here and it was

1019
05:15:32,009 --> 05:15:46,439
enough zone optional zone in like this magic stomach anything else that's really ridiculous

1020
05:15:46,439 --> 05:16:00,700
though i feel bad all right so i can i'm assuming i can give the whisker to either the guy that's

1021
05:16:00,700 --> 05:16:06,220
sad or one of the guys in the trashcans and i think i'm gonna give it to the guy that's sad

1022
05:16:06,220 --> 05:16:10,139
because that's like that's fucked up he spent his like whole life with this fish why would i

1023
05:16:10,139 --> 05:16:15,689
give it to that guy why would i give it to the guy that's like please i want to be a fish kill it

1024
05:16:15,689 --> 05:16:30,740
why do i keep calling picto pics picross because this was called it's picross is the name of the

1031
05:19:24,340 --> 05:19:36,520
there'll be another one it'll be small i thought it was gonna be a little koi fish or something

1032
05:19:36,520 --> 05:20:22,200
all right let's go talk to the dumpster guy uh he seems to be out of his dumpster

1033
05:20:22,200 --> 05:20:42,360
alapis and there he is what how did this work ha i don't understand how this works

1034
05:20:43,319 --> 05:20:55,099
so he was in the bucket i killed the carp and then he becomes carp no sea man what about the

1035
05:20:55,099 --> 05:21:15,220
other one i want to talk to the other one it's just like the giant rat didn't get any of the

1036
05:21:15,220 --> 05:21:22,330
mask pieces what a shame all right we'll get what are the three what does it do if you get all three

1037
05:21:22,330 --> 05:21:26,090
i mean that's they're very expensive five thousand dollars like 12 carps 12

1038
05:21:26,650 --> 05:21:45,060
that's a lot what does it actually do you can level attack power with five levels it turns skill

1039
05:21:45,060 --> 05:21:59,450
points into attack points oh that's kind of useful i'm so confused by what this any of this even

1040
05:21:59,450 --> 05:22:25,639
means this is dead why there's a boss there's a boss in there it's a new world okay so one lives

1041
05:22:25,720 --> 05:22:42,970
one dies cool all right well i think that's gonna do it sakira i've tied up pretty much

1042
05:22:43,529 --> 05:23:03,830
most of the loose ends somebody must be to go dive in the water here there's at least see the

1043
05:23:03,830 --> 05:23:10,150
optional boss in the estate okay well it's in the water that's this is where the headless is is it

1044
05:23:14,619 --> 05:23:30,599
dive in the water here i mean like over this way other way you can't get the estate boss

1045
05:23:30,599 --> 05:23:40,360
so did i go too far you guys know who jerk is gonna stream today

1046
05:23:43,529 --> 05:23:59,029

1047
05:24:00,919 --> 05:24:12,060

1048
05:24:34,549 --> 05:24:39,029
yeah no i killed this already there's one down here yeah i already killed this one

1049
05:24:40,409 --> 05:24:44,330
i already got that one so i can i can't do the uh the optional boss in the estate

1050
05:24:45,529 --> 05:25:04,520
is the lottery thing still happening if i can do it yeah so where in the estate just out of

1051
05:25:04,520 --> 05:25:12,330
curiosity see if i can see it no that's that's not it's very different ending okay all right

1052
05:25:15,500 --> 05:25:21,560
so i've seen pretty much everything i need to see game's fucking fantastic

1053
05:25:22,360 --> 05:25:36,380
picto pics waiting room yeah i thought i was gonna be i think we're just gonna call it i think we're

1054
05:25:36,380 --> 05:25:54,790
just gonna call it i'm gonna get out of the game and open up picto pics that's it calling

1055
05:25:54,790 --> 05:26:07,849
siciro that's the end sad because i don't see another playthrough in the future for me

1056
05:26:09,080 --> 05:26:25,720
maybe eventually but what an experience it was view the memory what are you talking about here

1057
05:26:25,720 --> 05:26:49,020
like this thing oh no never mind watch the other endings i don't want to do that

1058
05:26:49,020 --> 05:27:00,299
because if i ever uh if for some reason i ever want to play it again i kind of want to do a

1059
05:27:00,299 --> 05:27:07,270
different thing one who returns from the great beyond does so at the peak of their prosperity

1060
05:27:07,270 --> 05:27:11,189
issuing coveted strength in all manner of techniques throughout his mortal struggle

1061
05:27:11,189 --> 05:27:21,540
he wished for war until his final hour and that is precisely what he got the end the only one that

1062
05:27:21,540 --> 05:27:41,060
made it out alive was the random vendor i got a new skill too yeah uh where is it is it a combat

1063
05:27:41,060 --> 05:27:56,380
art mortal draw was this it which one was a dragon flash read us a bedtime story draw your sword
