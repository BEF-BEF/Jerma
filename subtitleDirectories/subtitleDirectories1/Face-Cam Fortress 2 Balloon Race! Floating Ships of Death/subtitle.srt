1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,689
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.

2
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:17,660
It's been a while since I've seen some Facecam Fortress 2, and I do apologize about that.

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,960
What the hell? What? What? Whoa, hey! That guy's like glitching through the gate!

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,859
Uh, this is Balloon Race, by the way, if you didn't know.

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,859
How did that guy, like, get through the gate? What a freak show.

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,020
Gonna do some Facecam Fortress on Balloon Race.

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,969
What the hell? Music is playing in the background right now.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,369
Get back on that ship.

9
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,670
What's up, everybody?

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,070
Oh, oh, oh!

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,750
What? Did they spawn, like...

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,750
What? What?

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,149
I have no idea how this mode really, like, works.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,229
Oh, Scout!

15
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,030
They're just, like, appearing on our ship?

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,420
BS.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,049
What the? Get what? Pyro, get the hell out of here, man!

18
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:05,260
How are they getting on our boat? I wish I, like, played this for, like, 15 seconds before recording.

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,670
Oh, get that medic.

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,629
Give me an overheal, baby. Give me an overheal.

21
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,599
Get out of here, Scout!

22
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,180
Get out of here, Pyro! People are just, like, glitching onto the boat.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,329
Help me! Help me!

24
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,900
Oh, sick dispenser, baby.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,780
Right now, bang.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,579
Oh, you can't... Oh, you can shoot through. Good.

27
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,140
Good, good, good. I was gonna say, that would suck.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,359
Give me more health. This guy's trying to shoot in the window.

29
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,459
Oh, I gotta lead my targets a little bit here.

30
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,859
Try and get it in the window.

31
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,230
I got it in the window.

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,540
This is ridiculous.

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,230
They're gonna win!

34
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,700
Oh, get crit!

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,790
All right, seriously, I need some, uh... I need a medic.

36
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,230
I need a medic right now.

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,390
Heal me, man. Heal me.

38
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,219
Come on, heal me.

39
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,219
Come on!

40
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,939
Oh, man!

41
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,489
Let's get up there. I don't have enough health to get up there, actually.

42
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,519
Damn it. Oh, I'm so scared.

43
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,920
It's all right. Get out of here, Heavy.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,180
Get the hell... bang!

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,439
Bang!

46
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,460
Can I climb the ladder?

47
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,259
Oh, my God, I can climb the ladder!

48
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,539
I ca...

49
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,509
Apparently, I killed two people.

50
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:23,300
So, that's how people are getting on the boat. All right.

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,270
Here we go, baby. Rocket jump!

52
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,259
Get out of my face!

53
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,340
Uh...

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,139
I kinda wanna climb up this thing again. I'm gonna die instantly.

55
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,139
Ah!

56
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,990
I did it again. I killed myself again.

57
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,590
All right, I'm not going over there just yet.

58
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,449
I'm gonna get, uh... I'm gonna get my rage up a little bit here.

59
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,960
So, how the hell do you, uh...

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,620
How the hell do you move the boat from here?

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,419
What? What? Hey, whoa!

62
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,580
Whoa, what is this guy doing in here?

63
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,150
What? This guy's in our spawn!

64
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,639
That's the glitching demo man from the beginning.

65
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,539
What a son of a bitch.

66
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,110
The guy's just, like, hanging out in the spawn with his, like, glitches.

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,949
Let me just hit a tree real quick.

68
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,150
All right, here we go.

69
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,550
What's up, everybody?

70
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,129
Mini Sentry, screw you!

71
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,610
Come here, you...

72
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,909
We don't even have the first point capped.

73
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:28,030
How do you cap points?

74
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,669
I have no idea what's happening.

75
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,030
I got him.

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,990
Pyro coming down the stairs.

77
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,699
Oh, so we have to cap that?

78
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,129
We just, like, stand on the treasure chest?

79
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,129
All right, I think I get it now.

80
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,750
I think... What? Oh.

81
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,569
Get... I seriously have no clue.

82
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,969
It's definitely the treasure chest.

83
00:03:53,969 --> 00:04:02,099
All right, now knowing that, I'm hanging out up here.

84
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,780
Come here.

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,979
Oh, let me help this heavy out.

86
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,419
Let's get it! Let's cap it!

87
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,460
Come on!

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,300
Come on, everybody! Come on!

89
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,650
Ugh! Dammit!

90
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,089
This is point number one.

91
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,720
There's so much going on right now for my tiny brain to handle.

92
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,519
Oh, we got it. We got it.

93
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,339
Good, good, good. Good job. Good job.

94
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:27,100
Shoot it back in that window, baby.

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,939
Let's get this boat moving.

96
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,139
Oh, ship. I keep calling it different things.

97
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,170
Get back down here.

98
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,970
Let's hide down here.

99
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,459
Ah...

100
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,860
This heavy's freaking out.

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,730
That's a good thing.

102
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,540
Oh, long shot. Long shot.

103
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
I'm standing still right now.

104
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,269
This is not gonna be good.

105
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,410
There we go.

106
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,160
This huntsman right is just in his glory mode.

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
They're all swimming.

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,660
They're all swimming over here.

109
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,089
Oh, let's beach it. Let's beach it.

110
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:06,490
Oh, yeah, we're beaching it.

111
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,540
This guy's toast right here.

112
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,959
He died before I could even get to him.

113
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,759
Oh, no, you don't.

114
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,759
Oh, no, you don't.

115
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,550
Oh, no, you don't.

116
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,350
Oh, boy.

117
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,529
I'm in trouble.

118
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,339
I'm in trouble.

119
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:23,050
Are they teleporters?

120
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,050
I am so confused right now.

121
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,290
I'm going in a teleporter.

122
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,490
Can I destroy these?

123
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,879
No, let's go in.

124
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,629
Can I go in?

125
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,149
Dammit, you can't go in.

126
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,379
Get out of town here.

127
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,870
Oh, I can go...

128
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,870
Apparently, I died.

129
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,870
Don't know how.

130
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,870
Apparently, a mini-century.

131
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,180
Who knows?

132
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,629
Whoa.

133
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:47,629
Dude.

134
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,230
Oh, somebody get hit by that crit.

135
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,300
No, I didn't do good enough.

136
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,899
Well, we're way behind right now.

137
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:57,699
Shoot it.

138
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:00,889
Let me shoot through that thing.

139
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,889
This guy's got a wrangled mini-century.

140
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:09,720
All right, let's go.

141
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm going to cause absolute carnage right here.

142
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,019
You ready for this?

143
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,250
Carnage mode activated.

144
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,620
Stickies.

145
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,819
You're pushing me off.

146
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,759
Let's push.

147
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,160
The thing, the boat pushed me off the frigging...

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:32,339
Let's go here.

149
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,540
Is he going to get hit by that crit?

150
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,339
He's standing still.

151
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:40,569
Oh, I killed two people.

152
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,860
I killed two people with that.

153
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,420
Are you kidding me?

154
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,910
No, you're pushing me off.

155
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,110
That big fat bastion heavy just shoved me off of it.

156
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,810
Oh, you...

157
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,110
Oh my God, that was crazy.

158
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,709
We are so far behind.

159
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,709
I don't know where I'm going,

160
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,910
but apparently, we're going down here.

161
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,709
Get everybody.

162
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,620
Give me like a triple kill right here.

163
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,899
Heal me, Medic.

164
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,300
Come here, you...

165
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,540
He's dead.

166
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,250
Ugh.

167
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,250
Balloon Race is out of control.

168
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,449
Holy crap.

169
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,939
Nobody on...

170
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,490
All right, get on that point.

171
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,850
I got to land some shots.

172
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,310
Oh, they're all coming up here right now.

173
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,709
That guy's got crits.

174
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,750
He can't hit me.

175
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,410
Aha, he can't hit me.

176
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,500
Oh, get it.

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,459
Get it, baby.

178
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:45,569
They capped that point, too.

179
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,170
I'm going to kill that...

180
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,170
No, I got him.

181
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,170
Oh, yeah.

182
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,970
I'm so happy about that shot.

183
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,389
Yeah.

184
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,189
Wait for me.

185
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,389
Wait for me, please.

186
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,189
Please.

187
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,740
Yeah, okay.

188
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,540
Janka.

189
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,339
El Doctor.

190
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,209
Dying, I'm dying.

191
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,250
I'm dying.

192
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,250
Oh, you got to heal me, Medic.

193
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,250
You got to heal me.

194
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,560
Damn it.

195
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
We are getting beat pretty bad right now,

196
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,759
I'm assuming.

197
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,720
Judging by the fact that we crit.

198
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,300
Didn't kill anybody with it, though.

199
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,800
And apparently, I still have the rage.

200
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,040
Oh, we're about to lose.

201
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,600
Oh, you scorch shot, son of a bitch.

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
That guy's got the right idea.

203
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,399
He's got the scorch shot.

204
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,100
You bastard.

205
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,769
Oh, it's over.

206
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,169
It is over right now.

207
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,690
It's over.

208
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,379
It is so over.

209
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:40,779
We can't...

210
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,879
I keep hitting those people in the back.

211
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,679
All right, we're going for an epic rocket jump super kill.

212
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,480
Here we go.

213
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,809
Oh, yeah.

214
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:51,950
I'm on the king of the mountain.

215
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,750
The killer.

216
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm just going to stop whipping people.

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,519
Are we actually going to cap this?

218
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,700
No, we're not.

219
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,450
Oh, man.

220
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,649
I got to stay alive up here.

221
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,629
Crap.

222
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:13,830
This is just complete chaos.

223
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,629
Is anybody even going to be able to get this point?

224
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,230
I don't think anyone's going to be able to even cap this point.

225
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,840
It is too chaotic.

226
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,399
Get out of here.

227
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,399
See you later.

228
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,789
I'm gone.

229
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,950
Wow, blue's actually on it.

230
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,549
We're going to cap it.

231
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:38,149
Is this going to be a tie?

232
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,149
This is going to be a tie, right?

233
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,149
It has to be.

234
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,779
Time has been added.

235
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,580
There's more time left?

236
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,740
What else are we going to do?

237
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:55,820
No, don't leave without me.

238
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,500
I missed the boat.

239
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,299
So do we just go in a circle?

240
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,139
When does this end?

241
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,740
How do you like beat?

242
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,639
Oh, no vote.

243
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,600
I don't know.

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,899
How do you win?

245
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,299
I think we're...

246
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,679
This is just like an open field over here.

247
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,480
I've only played Balloon Race like a couple times,

248
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,980
and maybe like three or four times,

249
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,320
and I loved it,

250
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,610
but I just never really understand what the hell is going on in this game mode.

251
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,809
I'm jumping off the boat.

252
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,720
We're going to try and pick some people off.

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,269
Let me get a couple of long-range beauty shots.

254
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,070
Just going to clean people up as they come down.

255
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,070
What's up?

256
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,580
I got crushed.

257
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,679
You're wrangling a sentry from all the way back there.

258
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,419
Holy crap, man.

259
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:50,279
No, no, no.

260
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,919
Way too many people.

261
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,559
Get rid of this heavy.

262
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,440
Thank you.

263
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,279
And get rid of this guy.

264
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,080
This guy right here.

265
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,879
Get rid of him.

266
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,419
And this guy.

267
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,149
No.

268
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,590
Yay, we did it.

269
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,639
And I got on the top of the scoreboard somehow.

270
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,960
Well, that's going to be it, guys.

271
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,159
Thank you all so much for watching.

272
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,059
Really do appreciate it.

273
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:22,399
Balloon Race for the return of Facecam Fortress 2.

274
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,399
I'll see you guys all next time.

275
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,570
And of course...

276
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,809
Wait, we won again?

277
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,419
Is that a double victory?

278
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,120
Sweet, dude.

279
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
Well, I'll see you guys all next time.

280
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,120
And of course, take care, everybody.

281
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,720
See you all soon.
