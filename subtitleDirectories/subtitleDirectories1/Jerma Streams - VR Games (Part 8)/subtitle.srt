1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,710
Hey, I have to talk a little low today because I turned my compressor way up because I'm going

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:21,589
to be standing kind of far away. Oh wait, Robo? What? Is it a Robo? Hello? What does it sound like?

3
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:32,140
It sounds like Kylo Ren. Not supposed to. Does it sound like Kylo Ren? How's this?

4
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:42,939
This reverb? There shouldn't be any reverb. How about now? Is that better? Is that a little

5
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:55,289
bit better? No. How would there be reverb right now? There shouldn't be reverb. Why are you

6
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:06,359
in a gym pool room? Is it two mics? It shouldn't be. Oh, wait a minute. I need to be alive. Listen

7
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:14,599
to this. Let me see what this sounds like. It sounds like a gym pool room. All right, hold on.

8
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:23,769
Let me see if I can hear what you're talking about. Gym. All right. Well, let me explain

9
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:32,019
something for a second. I have reinstalled Windows. Okay. So last night I reinstalled Windows,

10
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:51,750
got VR to work. Is it a gymnasium? So I got VR to work. Oh, shit. Hold on. Hello? Okay, let me see.

11
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,269
That sounds much better. That sounds better. Okay, so what happened was,

12
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:07,420
uh, yeah, I was listening to it at the same time. Fucking gymnasium. Okay, so that's better.

13
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,780
So we sound fine. Okay, good. That means I can turn the compressor back up and

14
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,580
because I'm gonna be standing far away. All right, good. We're good. So let me tell you the story

15
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,629
before we go over. Vive is back in action. Yes, I have no idea what the fuck happened. I've

16
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:29,509
reinstalled Windows. I reinstalled every program and now my Vive works again. I uninstalled every

17
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:35,590
driver. I uninstalled every program. I've reinstalled my Bluetooth. Guys, I downloaded a program

18
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,229
called like Super Driver Booster and it updated like 115 drivers on my computer

19
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,340
and it didn't work. So I just reinstalled. No, it's not a virus. The thing actually worked.

20
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,960
Windows fucks up everything. I have no idea. So yeah, I know this. Spoilers. You can hear it.

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,979
Let me turn it off. We're getting back into VR. I told you it was gonna happen somewhere

22
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:09,960
at the end of September and look at me. Here we are. It's a legit virus my grandmother would

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,180
download. Well, your your favorite internet streamer downloaded it. I'm your favorite,

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,229
right? I have to be. Come on. It's October. Yeah. What happened to Far Cry 1? I'll tell you what

25
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:29,509
happened to Far Cry 1. I reinstalled Windows. It got VR to work. So I'm playing VR and like I don't

26
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,389
think I even want to play Far Cry 1. I remember that game. That's the game that's like impossible

27
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,710
even on easy and the enemies can shoot you from like 30 miles outside the map and through walls.

28
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:48,620
Well, I don't want to play that game. Yeah, I would turn that. That would be like a Ratatouille

29
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,050
stream and you know it. Far Cry 1 sucks to be honest. Yeah, I'll play it. You know what? I'll

30
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,800
play it. Everybody is waiting for me to play. Everybody's waiting for me to play Half-Life

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,139
Alyx, but I'm not going to do that today. It's been like more than a year since I've gone into

32
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:14,460
VR at all. So I'm going to ease into it. We're going to start Half-Life Alyx tomorrow. That's

33
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,449
the stream tomorrow. I'm going to warm up with some fucking Chikootery board today and then

34
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:29,610
tomorrow is Half-Life Alyx. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, I've spent like a year. Everything's set

35
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,329
up. It's ready to go. I'm just stalling because all my VR streams are like three hours long. So

36
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,329
I have to stall for like at least 10 minutes to add some, you know, content to the beginning of

37
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:46,730
the stream. I'll just shake up my fucking drink. All right, let me lower this because now you can

38
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:56,360
hear me. Tell me if it gets bad because I will try to fix it. All right, let's go. So the first

39
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:05,860
game we're going to play. Move over here. We're going to play Vacation Simulator. We're just easing

40
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:16,180
into it. Wait, I didn't fucking even tweet. Shit. This is a Tuber game. It's an ease into VR game.

41
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,199
Guys, I just like last time I have like 40 VR games that I downloaded. It's Chubby Bunny. No,

42
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:32,790
it's not Chubby Bunny time. Not on VR. What are you crazy? Okay, I just started typing Chubby Bunny

43
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,980
into my tweet. Like that's the thing I'm doing today. Chubby Bunny, come on in. Like that's

44
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:52,279
going to take three hours. Okay, let's see. What do I do? Yeah, VR. How about VR is back? That's

45
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,019
man. That's kind of that's too desperate. Like VR is back. Please come watch. VR meat and cheese.

46
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:10,649
No, that's what the title is. VR. Who cares? VR. That's it. VR meat and cheese. Sucks. Whatever.

47
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,389
Dude, I'm fucking laughing right now. I don't even know why. All right.

48
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:28,839
Why does it always default to German 98? Every time I type in my Twitch password into my Twitch

49
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,100
stream, I get this thing where it's like, oh, it auto goes to a Twitch channel called German 98.

50
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,100
And I'm like, that's not me, dude. Okay. I think we stalled long enough. It's time to go.

51
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:52,540
You leaked the password. All right, we're gonna have to see if this works. Well, here we go.

52
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:03,560
There you are. See, look, it's virtual reality. And me. So we are going to get started here.

53
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:17,449
I know I have idea. This is my coffee. He's here. It's him. The Reddit shelf. Can I tell you how

54
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:24,060
concerned I am today about this? I am really concerned that I'm going to hit this. I think

55
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,300
I'm going to move my entire VR setup into another room and just feed long cables into the room.

56
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:39,819
I have less space, guys, than last time I did VR. I can't move from here. If I go like two feet

57
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:48,170
that way or like two feet that way, I'm putting a hole in the wall. He got bigger. Nice. Did you

58
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:59,319
notice? Flip it when he does. I bet the whole thing's coming down. Look at how fucking annoying

59
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:08,259
this is. This is annoying. Why do they make these? This is, it's got spikes on it. Like it hurts to

60
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,660
hold this. It's like a challenge holding this fucking Starbucks cup. I don't even know why

61
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,709
they make these. It's a weapon. All right. You ready? I've stalled long enough. I'm wearing

62
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:28,120
pants, right? Let me put my headphones in. Make sure, you guys can hear this, right?

63
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,100
I can see the chat. Don't worry. I have the toolkit thing set up. Covered the game reward.

64
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:44,820
You're not going to see it at all today. Don't worry. Too quiet? I'm too quiet? Oh no, the game

65
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:54,679
is too quiet. Okay. I'll fix that. Don't worry. That was a one guy moment. Did I get one guide?

66
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:09,450
All right. Here we go. Ready? I'm going in. Okay. Yes, I still have the ice cream cones. I don't have

67
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:18,169
the fucking knuckle controllers. I'm sorry. I can't even hear myself. Grab a vacation pass

68
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:26,759
off the table to get started. Okay. I'm going in. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. It hurt. I was,

69
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,710
it was been on the top of my head for too long. Hold on. Dude, imagine if I just like,

70
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:41,860
just fucking bald and the hair is all stuck up here. Just got a haircut for this very purpose.

71
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:59,450
Shit. I forgot to wipe the lenses. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. Hold on. Because once you go in

72
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:07,129
here, you can't come out for like 30 minutes. I'm in. All right. Wait, which side was left and

73
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:20,169
right? I don't remember. Can you see? What the fuck? Why isn't it on? Okay. There we go.

74
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:36,899
All right. I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going to be in. I'm going in. I'm in. Vacation is

75
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:44,759
waiting human. Grab one of those passes. Where's my other hand? In. Where's my other hand?

76
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:56,580
I got two hands. Okay. Human one, human four, human five. Or the, yeah, I could see you. That's

77
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:04,809
me. Insert guest pass. Hello, human. Waiting for guest pass. Try to speak human five. Great.

78
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:19,750
Now put it in the slot and pull the lever. I'm getting plus twoed for that shit.

79
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm getting plus twoed for crunk. That's bullshit.

80
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,840
How are you? Vacation. We should learn how to talk to bots. When you're close,

81
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,000
just wait to get a bot's attention. I don't even wear the wrist wraps. I'm a fucking rebel.

82
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:51,529
That's a bad idea. Put those on. Nintendo warned me about that. What the fuck? I'm putting them on.

83
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:57,159
I know. It's been a long time. Give me a minute. The only way to get a bot to talk. Shut up. Try it

84
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:07,029
now. Shut up. Great job. You really nailed the standard human greeting protocol. This is a warm

85
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:15,990
up. This is a warm up. See? I've got a red dot sight. Hey, I would not say anything fucking mean to me.

86
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:27,590
I wasn't listening to any of that.

87
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,830
Fuck. Somebody said, somebody called me a fucking loser. Somebody called me short.

88
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:59,639
Oh, fucking NAA. How much ammo do I have? What do you say? Come take the thing out of the, oh,

89
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,009
now I'm getting too close. Hold on. What do you say? Get into the bathroom so you can get

90
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:13,029
ready to vacation. Let's go. Every human starts as a blank slate. You can be the you you see in

91
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:21,429
yourself. You're gonna watch me in the bathroom? Where's the toilet? Do I piss into the sand

92
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:37,399
bathtub? This is uh, this, this, this isn't like your grandmother's house. This is to make you

93
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:55,210
not think that you've had or something. Good. All right. Now what? Oh shit. All right. Come on.

94
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:08,570
Okay. Now Jeremy, you're looking for 40 cents. What is this? Makeup? Oh, it's snow. It's skin.

95
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:23,909
Okay. Mr. Greens. I'm sorry. I'm acting like this is the first time I've ever put this on.

96
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm sorry. It's been a year. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go back, back, back, back, back, back,

97
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:44,169
back, back. I want to go back. No, I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want

98
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,169
to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to be,

99
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:55,980
I want to be a Ninja Turtle. Thank you. Am I in a Don't Tell on mood today?

100
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:15,399
Ah, Leonardo. Any green? Dude, you know, you know what I'm thinking? Why, why, why have they not

101
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,929
given a Ninja Turtle a beard? I think that would like really, really do well with like the zoomers,

102
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:34,440
don't you think? Like, like a nice, like clean shaved beard. I don't care about any of this.

103
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:50,549
Would you wear glasses over your VR headset? I don't care. Oh, shit. I don't have, I don't

104
00:15:50,549 --> 00:16:06,700
have any hair for that. Oh, that hurts. You guys ever, hey, do you guys ever do this? I do, I do

105
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:21,450
this. I go, everybody does that. Why? Cause it gets, I don't know, it gets a little irritated

106
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,509
there. I look, I've seen, I don't know where you are, but I've seen the photo. I've seen the photos

107
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,740
of my armpit hair and it kind of freaks me out. So yeah, I got to stay on top of it because people

108
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,500
will take like a small clip of me like with my arm up and they'll like zoom in on my fucking armpit

109
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:46,259
hair. And the only thing that they say is hair, hair, look at hair, hair. And it's like, yeah,

110
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:53,850
yeah, yeah, we got hair. Okay. Oh God. What did I just hit? That's not real. I thought I knocked

111
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,450
something off the table. I thought I knocked something off of my table. That's just a fake

112
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:30,730
toothbrush. How do I do this? Oh shit. This is cool. Okay. Brush it up down there. Oh, you do drink

113
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:45,509
it. Don't do that. Why would you do that? Why did you drink toothpaste? Don't do this challenge

114
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,069
video. Okay.

115
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:07,289
All right. I think we're good. Can I leave the bathroom? Look crazy.

116
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:18,119
We have an am I in the room? I don't even know. Oh my God. It's a bath toy.

117
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:52,150
I lost an earbud. Hold on. All right. We're in the bath. These bath bombs. Oh, they are.

118
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:11,140
Are they bath bombs? Oh, that's dumb. It's rain. What? Oh, nice. Okay.

119
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:30,099
Shit. Be careful. Hey, oh, bubble bath. My favorite. Ah, is this even hot?

120
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,559
Where are the bubbles? This is fucking bullshit. This ain't Elmo bubble bath, the best one.

121
00:19:43,380 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm going to hit something. Let's make a fucking fire. Okay. I ate it. All right. Oh, that's fun.

122
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm done. Electronics in there. I can't help it. It's VR, dude. Nothing. It's not even real life.

123
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:46,950
It's VR. Oh, isn't there a video of a cat doing this under the faucet? Just sitting there and

124
00:20:46,950 --> 00:21:03,750
just drinking cat like goes, it's like a funny cat video. That was cool. I got this long hair,

125
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:23,609
the carrot top. I'm having too much fun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

126
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:33,609
no, no, no. I can't have Twitch TV here. How about this? It's DJ time.

127
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,109
I forgot how much fun this was.

128
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:01,269
Here, take this one of a kind human back storage device. Wow, human, you look really tourist.

129
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:10,150
Feel free to continue exploring your suite. There better be a stack of red balls in there.

130
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:18,569
God, I like this one. This one's fun. Holy shit. This is a fun game. I like this one. I'm going to

131
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:29,769
stay in this one for a while. Kramer. You know what to do? Honky choco. Oh, diet doctor oil.

132
00:22:30,569 --> 00:23:06,920
Hi, room. Is this somebody else's hotel room? It is. What am I? Don't make like a slam your

133
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,359
don't. Why would I make a slam your dick in the fridge joke? That's what I do that for.

134
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,849
I'm just I'm kind of unhinged right now, right? I shouldn't. I'm not going to do that.

135
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:26,740
Game's fucking terrible. Delete it. That didn't even break. I like it again. Hot drink pods,

136
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:51,529
lemon juice. Is VR so cool? All right. Lemon juice. Okay. Should I call Grover? Oops.

137
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:16,170
I just told him to go fuck himself in binary. All right. Where am I? Where am I in the room?

138
00:24:16,890 --> 00:25:00,009
Blackjack on here. It's not even hard. Game's not even hard. I fucking win again.

139
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:15,049
Let's try the computer to go fuck himself in binary. All right. Let's go. This is an ego

140
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:32,009
stream. Bod watchers skip. It was the same joke. You can make the same joke within that was a one.

141
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:46,069
I guess one minute went by. This was my room. Let me know if you're ready to vacation and remember

142
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:57,740
waving is the best way to talk to bots. All right. Where do you guys want to go? Beach,

143
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,049
the forest or the mountain? No, I'm not. What? Are you ready to go human? You have to wave at me

144
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,539
if you want to talk in beach, beach, beach, beach, beach. All right. We'll go beach. How do I go?

145
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:19,849
Please only scan the hand that has the resort provided wristband for the resort scanner to

146
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:25,210
function. You must lateral hand movement also called waving is a convenient way. I need a

147
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,769
pass. We were ready to vacation, but it looks like all the destinations are closed right now.

148
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:37,420
What is this? This wasn't here earlier. Funny. You should ask the bureau of simulations requires

149
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:43,900
my goggles are getting steamy. Which you seem to have conveniently forgotten. Luckily,

150
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:52,259
I figured out a way to measure vacation, quantified memory management efficiency, but I should have

151
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,859
known here human take this wristband. It will be your key to unlock efficient. How many viewers

152
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:05,579
are here? Oh good. It's okay. There's 7,200 people here. Efficient. Now use it on that scanner over

153
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:15,220
there. Access denied. You don't have enough memories. Yes. You need memories to gain access

154
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:27,000
to different areas of the resort here. Try this. A memory of the time is how you vacation.

155
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,759
What did he just say to me? Can he just tell me to go fuck myself? It looks like your wristband

156
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,079
has enough memories for that scanner. Bring it back for the third time. Bring it back for a third

157
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:48,970
time. Accepted. When that vacation is open, you can visit any of our three destinations.

158
00:27:48,970 --> 00:28:05,500
The beach is the most efficient place to start. Quiet. I want to play that way. Please select.

159
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,900
The beach is a great place to start your vacation. That's where I want to go. I want to go to the

160
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:20,380
beach. Oh, I had to like wave at it. Welcome to Vacation Beach. Humans came to the beach to

161
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,619
reconnect to the moment they evolved to walk on land. All right, move. I see you're finally

162
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:32,700
getting the hang of vacation. Make enough memories and you'll get access to more areas of Vacation

163
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Island. Cosmo and Wanda, leave me the fuck alone. I'm happy we made it to the beach. The Bureau of

164
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:46,460
Simulations won't be... I wish I had no grandparents. Boom. They're gone. Didn't he do that in an

165
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,539
episode? But I know a way to track the moments you enjoy. And then like the apocalypse happened?

166
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,180
The camera in your backpack. It happened in one of those. Try it out. It happened, right?

167
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:05,690
Just tap the button on the camera to snap a photo. Oh, this is cool. Now this is vacation. Wait,

168
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,769
am I going to put the backpack? There are plenty of actual memories to be made on the beach.

169
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:16,009
But actually, I know that actually happened. Have fun vacationing your way, human.

170
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:23,829
Oh, you can do a selfie. We'll see you later. Why are all selfies all the way up like that?

171
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:30,789
How come there's no selfies like this? They're all always like that. Why? What does this do? I

172
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:38,019
don't understand. Why don't you just do this? I have to go like this? Why? It's too high.

173
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,980
Explain it to me. Because everybody's ugly and that looks good from up there.

174
00:29:43,940 --> 00:30:03,529
Well, I guess you can go instead of like this and go see the difference. Yeah, that makes sense.

175
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:09,819
Oh, shit. I just took a picture of like my... Stop taking photos. I got it. Put it in the backpack.

176
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:33,299
Are you alive? I didn't... I dropped it a little. Oh, no, no. This guy needs some sunscreen. I had...

177
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:40,549
This is like GTA, guys. You have to punch the first person you see. How do I travel around?

178
00:30:40,549 --> 00:31:08,009
Are you using that? Can I... Are you using this? Is this guy dead? Is he... Hey,

179
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:28,779
Marley, throw me the ball. Throw me the ball. I'm concerned about this guy. The sun is on,

180
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:43,099
the water is wet. Oh, yes. Pass me a ball and then it's game on. Hey, it's a handball.

181
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:48,299
Right now what? The rules are simple. Get the ball past me and I'll hand you a point.

182
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:59,220
Try to beat my high score, human. That's one. Where am I? Well, how close am I? I don't know

183
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:19,160
where I am. Watch this technique, ready? Fuck, never mind. That's it? With more training,

184
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:27,640
you can get that high score. Lost. Let's go. I gotta get a good one. Where am I? Perfect time

185
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:37,799
for sports. Hey there, human. Toss me something. Oh, it's all hands on and off. I wanna go to the

186
00:32:37,799 --> 00:33:04,259
dive site next. This is so fun. Okay, give me a ball. I don't know where I am. The shelf. Is it

187
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:22,500
the red shelf? Is it okay? Is it all right? It's coming down. Oh, it's like a daria. No,

188
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:39,900
that would be this. I need another ball. Move forward. It's falling. That thing back to that

189
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:49,609
thing just rushes me. He's got low blood sugar. No, I don't. I've eaten. I'm fine.

190
00:33:51,779 --> 00:34:02,619
Blood sugar. I need another ball. Burgers are up there. Fuck this game. Oh, yes.

191
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:17,260
Oh, what the fuck, dude? Oh, I can dig there. Maybe I'll get a fucking coin.

192
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:33,460
That was a plus two. Are you fucking serious? Are you guys kidding me? Are you serious? Really?

193
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:45,380
That's an Animal Crossing joke. You guys love that game. Really? Come on, dude. What do I do?

194
00:34:45,940 --> 00:35:00,139
I just... Who eats a hamburger like this? This is like the police cut off the crust. Okay,

195
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:14,489
that was weird. All right. All right. What we got? Beach cheese. What are these? Tortillas?

196
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,130
I'm on there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

197
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:28,119
I'm a human. I'm a tall box. I'm a super computer behind machine.

198
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,199
But I think I'm an animal in the head. Can you help me clear some of these requests?

199
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:55,269
Thank God we got it. Okay, well, I need a patty, right? A Minecraft cheese blocker.

200
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:30,869
All right. Can I break this down? Can I melt? I got to make my perfect burger. Fuck. Not too

201
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:37,130
much. A little bit more. All right. That looks good. No, just no gross ketchup. No gross mustard.

202
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,750
Come on. Give me that one. Oh shit. I touched it.

203
00:36:48,710 --> 00:37:02,659
They have any vegetables? How come there's no vegetables?

204
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:43,000
This looks like a really shitty cake. Oh, wait a minute. There we go. Come on. Get on there.

205
00:37:48,070 --> 00:38:06,409
Where's the lettuce? Hey, I'm taking this with me. Guys, it's made out of fondant. Don't worry.

206
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:31,719
These redeem at the front desk for 20 tokens. I want to make a hot dog.

207
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:58,440
Swiss cheese. That's the best. Let's want it. But you don't act like you guys don't do the same

208
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:13,289
thing. Wouldn't do this. Okay. Dog in there. Is it frozen? That's fucking rancid. People do that

209
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:41,579
shit, you know. Nice. All right. Good. Little bit of oil. Ketchup. Mustard. Ketchup. Bacon. Right?

210
00:39:41,579 --> 00:40:00,840
Right. Ketchup. Mustard. Bacon. What's the rest of it? All right. Let's go. That was fun. Oh,

211
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:17,219
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What am I doing? What am I thinking? I'm such an idiot. Where's

212
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:34,340
my camera? Okay. Selfie. How am I going to get? Wait. Set it up like this. I got to get this on

213
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:51,510
Instagram. I am so glad you're here to help me out. Check out the requests. Ah, got it. Good.

214
00:40:52,469 --> 00:41:06,019
All right. Get out of my way. It's all right. What is that over there? Nudge me? Sandcastle sandbox?

215
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,659
Welcome to the sandcastle station, human. You can design your own castle or try to follow the

216
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:20,739
blueprints. This is boring. No, I'm bored. Your minigame sucks. You should be more like the grill

217
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:29,369
guy up there. That's fun. Cool. And you have, by the way, you have the most expensive stand.

218
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:42,820
How many customers? Less than five? How many did the grill guy get up there? Like a hundred? Yeah,

219
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:55,210
well, you've got like an LCD screen too. Like this is rude. Missed so much. Missed 50 subs? Karen.

220
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:10,579
Minus two. Karen. I'm just, I'm not a Karen. No, I, guys, I have not walked up to the person filming

221
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:17,079
and went, what are you doing? What are you filming? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they bring up their

222
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:28,150
phone. How do you like that? Huh? I haven't done that yet. I haven't done that yet. Who gave the subs

223
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:42,170
yet? Was it? It was Freddy Dredd? Thanks, Freddy. Thank you for the 50 subs. Fucking crazy. That's

224
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:50,550
so much money. Thank you, Freddy. Hook was upside down. Just uh, hook was upside down.

225
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,829
I'm going to have a place of business here. Probably have at least a little bit of cleanliness.

226
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:06,380
Okay. That side there. Hi. Hello. Hi. Yes, I am a customer waiting to be served. Hey,

227
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,300
you're my first customer today. Yes. Let's make a memory together. Take a selfie and hand it to me

228
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,539
so I can frame this moment. And don't forget your camera hovers my human. It will let you strike a

229
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,980
sweet pose. The bottom right rainbow popsicle, when I press it, it sticks in a little bit.

230
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,820
I mean, I still got what I ordered. I still got the popsicle, but it sticks in and it's fucking

231
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,219
annoying. I bring me and my kids come in here all the time and one day they're probably going to get,

232
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,699
it's going to get stuck and it's going to get stuck too hard. They're not going to get it.

233
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:46,219
Oh, you're filming and you're filming. Oh, okay. Hello. Hello everybody. Yes. Filming me.

234
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:54,550
Good. Yeah. Good. Oh, well, what do you know? Now I can film you too. Okay. Smile, right?

235
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:15,449
Fucking asshole. Fix your fucking machine. I lost my Jaron. Oh, I can't. What happened to my other

236
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:21,909
earbud? All right. I want one of these. I'm getting strangled. I'm actually getting strangled right

237
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:27,940
now. Fucking vibe. I swear to God, I would, Hey, vibe. Yeah. Let me talk to the vibe manager.

238
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:32,630
And I said the earbuds like didn't just slip out every five seconds. You know,

239
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,829
one of these days it's going to get stuck in there and okay. Taking a selfie. Okay. Okay.

240
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:44,780
You enjoy vacation. I got it. Subject. You look amazing. You must be a model. Oh, thanks.

241
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,820
I want one of those. You're hurting for cash. You can find some sand dollars on the ground

242
00:44:49,900 --> 00:45:01,539
and shallow water. I want it for free. Oh, no memories. Do you want to help me prove that

243
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:05,699
beach vacation has the best moments? Give me a wave and I can tell you more.

244
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:16,219
Dive site. The joy of vacation is uncovered with tangible progress. In this case, you need five

245
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:23,699
memories to progress to the dive site. I haven't made any memories. What the fuck have I been doing?

246
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:26,820
All I've been doing has been making memories.

247
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:48,179
What are you talking about? I have to give photos. Look, you're obviously the hands of this operation.

248
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:54,630
So can you put the photo on the sketch yourself? Do you want to help me prove that beach vacation

249
00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:00,630
has the best? Tell me what to do. Give me a wave. How do I do this? Oh, hi there. Are you also on

250
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:07,030
vacation? So, well, I'm not here to make assumptions about what sketch you're capturing.

251
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:15,510
You're going to have to place your own photo. It's hard to watch his mind going like this.

252
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:23,269
Of my sibling bots, the beach is clearly the best vacation. Am I right? And I need your help to

253
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:29,909
prove it. If you could take some photos that match these sketches, I can show my siblings I had the

254
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:43,320
best vacation. What sketches? Grill. He wants a photo of a grill. What sketches is he talking

255
00:46:43,320 --> 00:47:04,570
about? Yes. Yes. This looks very photo. Now can you place it on the sketch? Oh, I did it. Now my

256
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:12,409
siblings will see how much fun I'm having. By the way, human, you can replace any photo on the stand

257
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:19,289
as long as it matches the original sketch. He wants a picture of like a hamburger

258
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:44,260
or a hot dog. Does it matter? All right. Let's go get that right now. I wasn't on the grill.

259
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:56,699
What the fuck was that? Oh, I'm whole. I thought I was holding it still. They defrosted.

260
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:08,250
I don't know. What the hell is this shit? Why is there like an upside down pineapple upside down

261
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:24,230
cake? Let's develop these. All right. I got it. That's what he wanted, right? I'm coming.

262
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:46,469
The fun of beach vacation inspired you human. Take this memory. Oh shit.

263
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,969
I need, I need three more memories. Let's go get them. Let's go make them.

264
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:03,289
Okay. What kind of memory can I do with you? Sorry. I'm like a dog. All right. What is it? What

265
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:12,469
are you doing? Oh my, would you look around? There are so many beach, all of these tiny creatures,

266
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:17,030
which would be a kind human and fetch me three different types. They're very shy.

267
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:38,630
So move slowly. Creatures. Shoot him out of the air. What is this? It's a manicotti. Here,

268
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:56,489
I got found you a manicotti. I want to look at that later. There's a motha boy. Does the butterfly

269
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:10,280
come back? Oh my God. I found money. All right. There he is. I got to get that guy. This whole

270
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,400
time he was sitting there just going like, please don't fucking see me. Please don't fucking see me.

271
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:31,719
Please don't fucking see me. Got one. Is he all right? Get him. Help, help, help. Oh, I killed

272
00:50:31,719 --> 00:51:02,710
him. I almost just fell backwards. How do I eat? Can I, how do I get these? Backpack. Hold on. Hey

273
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:10,820
little guy. I'm going to take you to safety. All right. What? How do I give this to her? And this

274
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:25,030
vibe headphones, man. Put him on the grill. No, I'm not going to grill him. That's fucked up.

275
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:33,320
I need the butterfly. All right. We have to, all right. I'm going to put you back.

276
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:38,039
I'm not going to cook him. Why would I do that? Here, sit on this little island.

277
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:33,000
He's okay. All right. Oh shit. No, I had to make the friends. Oh my God. Where's that camera?

278
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,639
Give me the camera. Give me it quickly. Holy shit. This is going to get me a lot of money on

279
00:52:37,639 --> 00:53:01,159
National Geographic. Oh my God. Wait, I get it. Good. Take a picture of them on the grill. No,

280
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:15,219
fuck out of here. We are. How are we? I'm not grilling these two. Look at how cute they are.

281
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:50,280
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that shit. No. What was the actual? Oh yeah. Got one.

282
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:54,599
Thank you, human. Two more butterflies will really make my screen.

283
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:18,760
Great. One more for my bug report. Okay. All right. One more. Where's the last one?

284
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:48,199
I see it right there. Thank you, human. And so my heart is filled and so is this bug report.

285
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:58,780
Let's bask in the memory like a butterfly in the sun. Beach bugs. Okay. I got money now.

286
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:05,989
All right. I got money. What do you want me to do? Hello, human. I'm still having fun in

287
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:21,980
this game. Do you like to do some yoga? What's all over here? Here, human. Please follow me

288
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:32,599
to achieve a state of optimal profiting. All right. Now we box. You seem to be out of alignment,

289
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:35,239
human. Don't forget to breathe.

290
00:55:48,860 --> 00:56:05,639
Am I asking too many questions? Inhale. Positive. Exhale. Negative.

291
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:23,239
Why do I have to hold them like this? That is very yoga. This is not how you do this.

292
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:34,309
Find your inner home page. I don't. Give me my money. I don't want the money for this. I don't

293
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:39,750
care about anything. Can you smell your stomach? Your precision algorithm is almost accurate.

294
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:50,329
Great job, human. Keep following the optimization procedure. I'm here. I'm going to turn the AC

295
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:57,719
down. I might have to take a little quick break after the beach. Yes. Feel the energy going

296
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:10,019
through your body. I don't want to do this. I feel like I'm like a monkey. Visualize a calm,

297
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:17,460
rolling ocean like this one. So excellent job. I hope your data is no longer compressed.

298
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:24,579
Take this memory. It is the essence of your path to relaxation. That's three memories, right?

299
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:39,380
Where am I? How close might I be? I need two more memories. Fine. Fine. I'll do it.

300
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:46,010
Oh, what the fuck? All right. Let's go. Fine. I'll do it. I'll make a memory.

301
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:57,219
Judge me. Where am I? I think you need to take a closer look at the blueprints, human.

302
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,039
Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Judge it.

303
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,760
The top is exactly what we're looking for. A front. Now we just need to make the rest match.

304
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:27,880
I feel like I'm doing the cup thing that they do in like the competitions where they go like,

305
00:58:31,860 --> 00:59:12,969
how do people do that shit? Yup. Dodge, please. What? The sides are correct.

306
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,090
Haven't had a chance to look at the blueprint, human.

307
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:33,849
Off to a good start. Your front is correct. How about this? Now you just need to work on the rest.

308
00:59:42,519 --> 01:00:29,460
This is the front. Right. I need a side. Am I doing wrong? Use the whole board. Turn on the

309
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:56,809
grill? Top right. Top right block. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with the top right? Fine.

310
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:19,019
Oh my god. He's pretending. His brain. Use the corners. Top right has a side.

311
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:25,739
What's going on? Top right. You can't be serious. Oh my god. He's insane.

312
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:37,929
Screamer. Fucking laugh. Different block. What? This is what you meant. I thought you meant like

313
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:48,250
this thing over here. I thought, okay. They didn't make it clear. You gotta say it top.

314
01:01:54,010 --> 01:02:03,349
What are you talking about? That's correct. This is incorrect?

315
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:17,530
Oh, it's the left side? The left side has to be like that too. They didn't say that. They didn't

316
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:36,949
say that. Or shit. Oh god. Fucking damn it. Okay, this is, it's too up. So this front, it's like

317
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:54,039
this weird, it's got a thing on it. It's got a lip on it. This one has got, the right side looks

318
01:02:54,039 --> 01:03:07,300
like this. Okay. And then this is that. And then this side is the front. That shit right there.

319
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:59,719
Right side. I know. I'm working on it. Okay. So front, three high. Okay. And right side.

320
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:12,019
What? What are you talking about? What's wrong with it? You graduated college? Yeah,

321
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:20,199
15 years ago. I haven't sat in a classroom in fucking 16 years. I've been eating cheeses

322
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:27,960
and drinking fucking cheese whiz and watching Netflix. I lost it all. I lost all of it. It was

323
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:51,900
16 years ago. Little bottom block is solid. I'll take a memory please.

324
01:04:51,900 --> 01:05:06,010
Nope. Beginner. I'm not, I don't want to do that anymore. That's, that's annoying.

325
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:12,489
It's annoying. Yeah. Your game is annoying. You're annoying too. Annoying hat, annoying glasses,

326
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:18,809
annoying, annoying fucking wind fury from Hearthstone. What's the guy's name? What's

327
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:28,739
the guy's name? The wind fury guy. What's his name? No, no, no, no, no. He goes, that's what

328
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:34,840
they didn't say. That's what they didn't say. Like swatting insects. Like swatting insects.

329
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:46,949
That's what they didn't say. Alkazir. Alkazir. Alakir. Yes. Thank you. Somebody got it. Somebody

330
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:57,380
went to college in here. How many more do I need? Just one more, right? Oh, here we go. I need another

331
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:15,110
ball. Hearthstone college. No, when you attack with Alakir, he goes, that's what they didn't

332
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,110
say. That's what they didn't say. Cause you can go twice. You're never going to un-hear it.

333
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:23,130
That's what they did say. I'm telling you. What does he have to do?

334
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:49,500
I win. Oh.

335
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:17,460
Dive. I can dive now. When is the next iPad stream? Why the fuck do you want an iPad stream?

336
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:32,869
Oh, wait. I hope you like our machine serve vending product. Oh,

337
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:42,949
put it down. Oh, okay. I'm all right. That just like, that just triggered like a response from me.

338
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:57,349
What happened to my ears? Dude, biting like directly into a fucking ice cream like that

339
01:07:57,349 --> 01:08:20,569
with like just, Oh, wait a minute. I hope you had an excellent time vending on vacation.

340
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:25,609
Humans use selfie as their primary method of communication. I'm that annoying guy with the

341
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:31,050
bottle of Sriracha that takes a bite and fucking puts a line down and takes a bite and puts a line

342
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:36,890
down and takes like, dude, fucking put it down, put it down. That stuff's gross. Don't do that.

343
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:47,210
Come on, man. Don't do that. Why are you that guy? Yes, I don't like Sriracha. I don't think it's

344
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:54,869
gross. I'll address you directly. I think Sriracha is gross. I think it just does. I think it just

345
01:08:54,869 --> 01:09:03,000
tastes sour and like it smells to me. All right. Did I just lose like a thousand viewers? Maybe.

346
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,039
I don't know. I just personally don't like it. I know people that love it, but that's great.

347
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:14,539
I'm a Tabasco guy. I know I just made, okay. I just pissed off a lot of people. That's fine.

348
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:22,279
I'm a green Tabasco guy or a Tabasco reserve guy. Let me address you directly.

349
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:43,939
Oh my God. I'm so excited. Thanks. I had fun at the daycare.

350
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:48,039
Oh shit.

351
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:33,109
Enjoy your dive, human. Okay. Looking for 40 cents. Rehash. That's a fucking rehash.

352
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:59,350
Oh, that was pretty cool. Hey, get away. You're going to propel it out. Grab a lens?

353
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:12,439
Did you die by eating these? You die. You can die if you eat this, right? Aren't there like

354
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,960
four chefs in all of the world that can actually make it so you don't die if you eat that? Why

355
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,760
would you want to eat that? Come down here to see the sunken ship, but I'm more interested in

356
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:29,189
marine life. Poisonous. But there are aquatic creatures down here unlike anything. These photos

357
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:36,060
of the more unique citizens of the sea. So I may add them to my collection. Hello photo lens.

358
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:54,659
I'm fucking realistic. I'll take these to my backpack. I'm sorry guys. Anything that has

359
01:11:54,659 --> 01:12:01,020
like a, like an 8% chance to kill me if I eat it. Uh, you know, it doesn't have that,

360
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:05,979
a toaster strudel. Just eat it. Well, why, why try to like hurt yourself to like eat like a rare

361
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:38,060
fish? I should probably move around. Fish eye lens. Oh, cool. All right, let's move.

362
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:46,420
Oh, the hole. Do not disturb. Please be nice.

363
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:58,420
That was the end of Yoshi, Nintendo 64. I will take the applause now. It's fucking up.

364
01:14:02,199 --> 01:15:19,029
What's the chopsticks? Hit detection sucks. Whoa. Shut up. Oh, I can get the picture of the, uh,

365
01:15:19,109 --> 01:15:31,529
I can picture the, the, the, I don't know, the, uh, the ink octopus thing. Ink, um,

366
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:46,649
octopus. Giant King. Oh, I love shit like the guys. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen,

367
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:55,270
listen, listen to me. The room as a VR game. If you don't think that I'm going to play that

368
01:15:55,989 --> 01:16:07,960
all fucking day, one of these days of room VR, I cannot wait. I can't fucking wait. All right.

369
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:43,319
How do I open it? It's a minfo. Oh wait, there's other keys here. All right. I got three keys.

370
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:07,829
The AC is on right now. It's blowing right on my head. Holy shit. This feels phenomenal.

371
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:39,380
Long John Silver really, uh, didn't spend very much time on that one.

372
01:17:39,380 --> 01:18:03,880
This looks the way that a hundred gecks sounds. Oh, I want that. Oh wait, I have,

373
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:18,020
I can get memories. Watch this. Oh no, no, no. I want the backpack. Stay there. Stay there. Okay.

374
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:31,109
Hold on. How do I take, how do you take the picture? How do I make it do a timer?

375
01:18:49,539 --> 01:19:33,529
Is it on? It kind of feels normal. I didn't get a memory for this. No, no, no, no, no. I wasn't

376
01:19:33,529 --> 01:19:43,800
done down there. Oh no. He doesn't have a show. Wait, pirate. Oh, being fishermen. Stack them.

377
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:53,670
All right. I want to go. I'm wait. How long have I been in here for? I need to come out for a second.

378
01:19:53,670 --> 01:20:03,619
Don't I? I need to take like a break. Don't I? I've been, I've been in there for an hour and 20

379
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:32,699
minutes. Holy shit. I haven't had a ton of fun. Wait, is it, how do I look? Do I have the lines?

380
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:46,920
Okay. I don't really have the lines. This is fucking fun. I forgot how fun this was. All right.

381
01:20:46,920 --> 01:21:03,380
Let's do a hair check. This looks, this looks deliberately styled like this. It does not,

382
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:17,189
it looks better than before. TikTok hair. Oh, I think I lost my audio. Hold on. What is TikTok

383
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:46,659
hair supposed to mean? Hold on. E-boy. What the fuck is an E-boy? Ew. Wait, there's so much sweat

384
01:21:46,659 --> 01:22:03,510
in here. Did the audio get dropped? How come I can't hear anything anymore? Can't hear anything.

385
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:11,340
We're in. Are we in? Good though. Yeah, we're good. All right. Let me put these back in and then

386
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,939
the headphones back in. Yeah, I wasn't getting audio when the headphones were in either.

387
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:26,579
Right. Oh, there we go. Mine is too gross. Wait, is it a joke if I have like a sweaty body?

388
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:30,659
Why? Do you think I just dumped water on myself and walked in here like, hey, look at, I'm so

389
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:48,920
gross. Isn't that a funny thing? Okay, here we go. Let's go. I'm ready to continue my vacation.

390
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:55,260
By the way, this, this one is way more fun than the first one. The first one was not even that

391
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:11,270
fun. This one's 10 times better. All right. I want to go back here. Why is that rude? That's

392
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:30,779
not rude. That's me being real. All right. What else could I, wait, what's this? I won. I got it.

393
01:23:34,579 --> 01:23:59,140
Come on, I gotta get the one up. Come on. Come on, do it. Come on, I gotta get 10 likes.

394
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:20,329
There's nothing else for me to do down here. Okay, let's go. Let's do a new vacation.

395
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:26,149
I have a very new vacation. What was the other one? Somebody said, people said go to the forest.

396
01:24:26,789 --> 01:24:40,939
Look, the puffer fish and me in VR. I think I probably actually could if I really wanted to.

397
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:47,560
I think I could probably do it. It would take me a minute. All right, new vacation.

398
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:55,909
All right, forest or I don't, I don't even know the forest or mountain.

399
01:24:55,909 --> 01:25:00,390
The metrics are concerning. I came here to help, but I'm not seeing the upward trend. I was

400
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:08,710
expecting. I know it looks bad, but he has Funko pops. Well, if the metrics cross zero,

401
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:13,670
the Bureau of Simulation automatically shut down the vacation simulator. Oh,

402
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:23,619
we're still far away from zero. Which one? Human. I set up this board to help you visualize your

403
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:29,979
memory progress. This is going to help you optimize your vacation. All right, we're going

404
01:25:29,979 --> 01:25:42,310
mountain. Welcome to snow. The only way you're going to reach peak performance is by collecting

405
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:47,350
more memories. Human. Remember, we don't need to be so focused on the goal. We can still have a

406
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:53,029
ton of fun getting there. Let me play. There is so much to do. I can't wait for you to see the

407
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:57,829
great idea. Oh, the overlook. Okay. Even more memories up there. Oh,

408
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:07,930
an even more space seat on jet blue. I already don't want to do this one.

409
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:16,020
I already don't want to do this. I know what it is. Yeah. You can shape this ice to your artistic

410
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:24,260
vision. The sculpture is already there. It's up to you to chip it out according to this blueprint.

411
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:32,220
All right. I actually, this one's cool. Right. The front row.

412
01:26:37,020 --> 01:27:09,319
Right side is one. Let's start here. This is the right side. Okay. One front row has four. Four.

413
01:27:09,319 --> 01:27:47,079
Right. Okay. Right side is one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

414
01:27:47,079 --> 01:28:01,609
and then one, two. Okay. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One,

415
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:33,829
two, three, four. Four. Your creativity shows no boundaries, human. It's a great start. There are

416
01:28:33,829 --> 01:28:40,390
many more opportunities to show your skills. All right. Keep going. Right side. All right. Front.

417
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:58,539
Oh, no. Bye. Thank you. Puzzle maker. Insert photo. Oh, we get to make up.

418
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:10,890
Oh my god. This is perfect. Do the edges first.

419
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:33,369
Oh, oh my god. Puzzles. Right. Okay. Come on, man. How do I get them back? All right. We're

420
01:29:33,369 --> 01:30:32,779
going to do the edges first. Oh, fuck. It's upside down. Um, I look at this. How do I restart it?

421
01:30:32,779 --> 01:30:38,250
I hope you love putting all the right pieces together as much as I do. Let me do.

422
01:30:47,239 --> 01:31:19,739
All right. Don't put it. We're going to start with face. Okay. That's good, right? Okay, man.

423
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:28,729
Relax. What? I'm actually pretty relaxed right now. Oh, because I said fucker. I'm not allowed

424
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:52,310
to swear. How does that look wrong? All right. That's like the chest hair. That's like a chest

425
01:31:52,310 --> 01:32:44,789
kind of. Okay. Okay. What's the rest of the face? Relax. Relax. Where is it? There. Got it. Part of

426
01:32:44,789 --> 01:33:04,039
the relax. We'll need a couple more pieces of the face. Nice. I'm getting there. Part of relax.

427
01:33:05,369 --> 01:33:13,140
Part of face and relax. Switch it around, please. Are you puzzled, human? Good. If you want a new

428
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:30,819
puzzle, just put a picture in that machine. That's the other way. It's wrong. Stop doing that.

429
01:33:43,779 --> 01:34:39,670
Know where it goes. Come on, dude. It's hard to see. Smooth brain. It's not smooth brain.

430
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:50,630
It's kind of blurry for me. You guys have the high definition view. I have the low definition

431
01:34:50,630 --> 01:35:06,979
view. I got both eyes at low depth. You got one eye at high depth. Oh, cool. This looks fun.

432
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:13,140
This is my dream game. This is a bunch of random things that take like 20 seconds to do and then

433
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:36,300
you just move on to the next thing. Hatch item here. Pirate hat pattern. This is like electricity.

434
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:59,699
That was dumb. That one's not even fun. Oh, we got another funny food machine. Oh, my goodness.

435
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:05,350
This is the best. When it has a funny food machine, it's the best. Okay. What do I want to do?

436
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:17,109
Human, some bots have requests for very specific orders. I'm operating on a higher level than

437
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:23,829
simple input output, so I'm just not going to do that. If you want to help, the next order

438
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:31,029
is over on the board. Or don't. It's not your job. It doesn't tell me what it is. It won't be my job

439
01:36:31,109 --> 01:37:01,739
either. Hey, what it is? It just says question mark. Apple mayonnaise pie. It's done.

440
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:07,819
It looks pretty good. Looks kind of accurate, actually. Let's test it.

441
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:18,979
Paper mache. Wait, that was the order book. That was the ingredients book. I think I...

442
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:32,409
Can I get another one? Children's game. Oh, dude, look at this. Oh, don't drop it. That's

443
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:53,020
in the beginning of that movie. Oh, with Orson Welles. Honey thermal paste. I don't... I'm going

444
01:37:53,020 --> 01:38:02,680
to make an apple pie. I'm going to serve it to somebody, I guess. Not a tomato, right? Apple,

445
01:38:06,489 --> 01:38:28,010
cream. Won't be needing that. Say cream and apple. Okay, got... Now, where's my tray?

446
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:44,140
Apple and cream. I'm just making every order at Starbucks. Yeah, I'll take like a spit of coffee

447
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:48,460
and then a bunch of like sugar, cream, milk, flavoring, caramel sauce and chocolate syrup

448
01:38:48,460 --> 01:39:23,430
and raspberry sauce. Okay. What do I do with it? Do I have like a... I don't... I'm a hands-off

449
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:29,850
partner in this kitchen. You have hands. So by definition, you should deliver the bot's order.

450
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:38,010
Oh, he ordered it. Okay. Hey, I got your order. Who ordered the easy cheese in between... Whatever

451
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:44,010
it is. Oh, I'll get that for you, sir. It looks like you dropped it. Oh, let me... I'll fix that

452
01:39:44,010 --> 01:40:12,579
for you right away. Don't worry. I'm working on it. Okay. Here it is. What are you doing in here?

453
01:40:12,579 --> 01:40:20,890
It's pretty good. Whatever. I don't think we're going to be able to warm the console up by hands.

454
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:26,659
Have you ever found something like that? Ice is nice in winter. Ice is also nice in drinks.

455
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:32,420
Ice skis are not nice. Oh, yes. Snow is great. I love snow so very much. Oh, avalanche. These are

456
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:39,699
poems. Okay. Skiing. Skiing is so rad. Wooshing on the snow so fast. Wish I had feet, though.

457
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:51,750
Ice again. It's cold and it's wet. If only I had some salt. Oh, no. My book froze. What is poems?

458
01:40:51,750 --> 01:41:18,149
Yeah. Eat. Oh, no. Hurry. Okay. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. I want it. One

459
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:59,460
second. One second. One second. Oh. Come here. Come on. Wasn't he a pie? You know, what do I do?

460
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:11,109
He needs water. He needs water. He needs water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Oh, God. I'll save

461
01:42:11,109 --> 01:42:27,239
you. I need water. I need water. I need water right now. Everybody got water? He needs water.

462
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:38,340
Wait. Wait a minute. No, I don't have any mayonnaise. Wait a minute. He's drinking to it.

463
01:42:39,460 --> 01:43:07,909
I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I lost my earbud. Don't worry, little guy. I got you.

464
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:18,710
Red. Wait. He liked it. He liked it. Oh, yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I brought it back to life.

465
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:26,380
Okay. Wait. Ice tea. He probably likes it. This is water, right? Okay. This is water. This counts as

466
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:47,380
water. I wonder if I can get bigger. What the hell is going on? Yeah, he's... Wait, he'll give me some

467
01:43:47,380 --> 01:44:33,100
soy milk. Eat as much as you want. Are you good? I don't know where I am in the room. I don't know

468
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,659
where I am in the room. I don't know where I am in the room. I don't know where I am in the room.

469
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:57,939
Did he just kiss me? What? This is fucking stupid. Is he upside down? I don't even know

470
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:03,500
which way is upside down or not. Well, I was supposed to make a cake or something.

471
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:13,109
What do I do with him? He's just eating the... Okay. You'll be fine in there. Just eat.

472
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:38,520
You want cheese and shit too? You want meat? Oh. How do I make a fucking cake?

473
01:45:39,319 --> 01:46:03,989
Oh, flour, eggs. Yeah, but I don't have a bowl. Wait, what am I supposed to make it in a mug?

474
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:48,899
I need a tray. One egg. Oh, it's a quiche. I actually don't have a tray though. Where's he?

475
01:46:48,979 --> 01:47:07,350
For me? Thank you. Got it. Got it. Where's the other guy? Okay. You mountain bot with a guy

476
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:12,229
with the shades wants something from the... I've got to hand it to you, human. Actually, you've

477
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:17,590
got to hand it to bot. All right. Fucking squash. As in the order. Make it snappy. A, I don't know.

478
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:32,420
Broccoli, lemon juice, carrot, eggs. A little bit of cheese. A couple of eggs. YouTube video.

479
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:37,060
We're making a YouTuber video. This is what we call a YouTuber special, guys.

480
01:47:37,859 --> 01:48:12,069
This is the YouTuber special. Think about your wacky fucking gross stuff. Wait, where is he?

481
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:26,680
Nice hot beverage for the mountain guy. Where's he up there? Hey, bottoms up. For me? I'll take it.

482
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:53,100
Come on. I can't. Oh, no. I'll get these off. Aquafizz. This machine will accept any official

483
01:48:53,100 --> 01:49:02,069
snowflakes. I think I've seen some lying around in the mountain. Okay. Me and my friend are going to

484
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:10,899
do this. Fine. Put you in the backpack. Oh shit. He can go on the... Nice. All right. Cool.

485
01:49:11,619 --> 01:49:21,130
Humble snow bot. Whatever. I don't care. What is this? Do not throw snow. What was that? What was

486
01:49:21,130 --> 01:50:36,810
that? Oh. What are you doing? Doing a thing you're saying not to do. God damn it. Give it to me. I

487
01:50:36,810 --> 01:51:30,920
want to do one cool thing. Fuck you, game. I fucking... Hey.

488
01:51:39,479 --> 01:52:10,789
Here. You should probably take this memory too. That guy. Oh my God. Why can I hit this guy?

489
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:34,619
I went right through his body. Give me the fucking memory.

490
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:54,760
Or it's time for bed. It's not time for bed. What memories do I have? I still got to figure

491
01:52:54,760 --> 01:53:00,439
out this thing. Wow. Congratulations. I'm too busy working on a soon to be award winning screenplay

492
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:07,560
to care. But there are more orders if that's your thing. Oh. How many is that?

493
01:53:08,359 --> 01:53:21,029
I got to... I know what to do. I need a hot drink. I need a hot drink so I can put it on. Yeah. I

494
01:53:21,029 --> 01:53:50,380
got it. Right? Okay. Hot drink. Thermal paste. Let's go. See how hot this is?

495
01:53:50,380 --> 01:54:06,250
That was exhilarating. I am ready to vent for many minutes. Oh look. But I think it's going to be

496
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:11,850
worth your time. Yes. I haven't had a grip since anyone came by the hot tub and I couldn't motivate

497
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:17,289
myself to turn the heat back on. I've always been a social bot but I guess nobody wants to chat.

498
01:54:17,289 --> 01:54:23,130
Thanks again for starting the heat back up. Bubbles? Sometimes you gotta get in and fix a problem,

499
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:26,890
you know? Get this out of here. I don't want this. The other day I found a bunch of dust and

500
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:32,970
fragments. I wasn't really sure what to do. But my buddy swears that a can of compressed air is the

501
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:38,010
way to go. I wasn't really sure what to do. What the fuck did I just happen? What happened? What

502
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:42,649
happened to this? So I just shook it in as deep as I could go and waved it around for a while.

503
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:49,609
I think it ended up blasting my processor fan with the air. But the straw definitely

504
01:54:49,609 --> 01:54:55,609
knocked some dust out. Don't think that was a good idea. Electrocute this person. Stop it. Stop talking.

505
01:54:55,609 --> 01:55:03,130
Yeah. Maybe not. Speaking of batteries. Why am I even in a hot tub? I could blow a circuit or

506
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:09,079
something. And I'm not exactly. I guess the tub has probably done a better job cleaning my vents

507
01:55:09,079 --> 01:55:14,760
than the dust remover. Get in there! Nothing like a good soap to get all the gunky bits out.

508
01:55:16,439 --> 01:55:20,920
Speaking of gunky bits. I saw efficiency bot hovering around here a while ago.

509
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:26,470
That broke some of the wrong way. Said something about bad metrics in my area. Not allowing you to

510
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:33,189
tell a human. I checked all my areas and I didn't find any metrics, good or bad. Do you know anything

511
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:38,710
about metrics, human? Did I get my memory from you? Very annoying. Yeah, me neither. I'm rarely asked

512
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:42,949
to measure anything besides when barista bot asked me to stay at least 10 feet away.

513
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:48,869
That's a pretty weird metric, given that a foot is an imperial unit and not a metric one. If they'd

514
01:55:48,869 --> 01:55:54,310
ask me to stay three meters away, I think it would have been more concise. Not sure why they asked me

515
01:55:54,310 --> 01:56:01,989
to stay away. It's not like I'm leaving this hot tub anytime soon. Like, um, oh yeah, cool. Catch you later, muleman.

516
01:56:01,989 --> 01:56:07,819
Spit of coffee. How many memories do I have? Can I go to the overlook?

517
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:51,420
Let's go. Enough, right? You need to pay close attention to the sketches.

518
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:58,760
This photo isn't what I need. Carrot. Oh, he needs a carrot, a hat, and glasses.

519
01:57:19,529 --> 01:57:48,789
No, don't eat it. Refresh. Give him like a big banana nose. He needs a hat too.

520
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:57,739
Okay, we're gonna give him like eyes. Here comes a penis joke.

521
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:10,550
Hey, do you think I'm gonna put the banana like where his dick is supposed to be?

522
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:19,050
Is that what you think I'm gonna do? Why else would you take the banana? Right? Okay, yeah, yeah,

523
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:25,130
do some detective work. Sure, sure, fine. Why else, why else would this guy take the banana?

524
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:32,170
Is there any other reason for that? I mean, very obviously it doesn't go there. So why would he

525
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:36,180
pick it? What does he think he's gonna do? You think you're gonna get like content by like putting

526
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:48,789
a banana dick on this guy? Let's find out. If you can't, you can't. Okay, let's go. Or content.

527
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:59,220
That's like, okay, anytime that you would go around your neighborhood and they would be

528
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:05,539
like a snowman, how many times did you guys go back like a couple hours later and the

529
01:59:05,539 --> 01:59:10,020
nose was down there and the two eyes were down there too? How many times? Be honest with me.

530
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:23,399
Like it happened to every single time. What do you mean never? Are you serious? You've never

531
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:36,010
like seen somebody like move it? Did you ever do that? I didn't do it. 50s memories.

532
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:45,180
Oh, the only difference here is the snow is not wicked fucking dirty. You build a snowman like

533
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:52,970
this, there's dirt and mud and it kind of smells. It like stinks. And it's like, you don't even want

534
01:59:52,970 --> 02:00:01,770
to touch it. You gotta wash your hands if you touch it. Yeah. And then, you know, like, okay,

535
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:06,649
you ever like take a piece of the snowman, it's like dirty, like head or like dirty gross, like

536
02:00:06,649 --> 02:00:12,970
snow and you eat it and you just taste dirt. I know for a fact that a ton of you guys have done that

537
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:18,149
when you were a little kid. You didn't go like this when the snowman was built. You didn't go,

538
02:00:22,069 --> 02:00:28,300
crunchy sand dirt, like dance sand and dirt. You know, you didn't think that was like funny

539
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:35,619
when you were a little kid. I don't believe any of you. I really don't. I don't believe a single

540
02:00:35,619 --> 02:00:48,149
one of you. All right. So he needs a hat. You have mine. That's it. And glasses. Get a photo.

541
02:00:48,149 --> 02:01:18,460
Perfect. Wait, his hands. Hey, hypers. And what was the other one? Just a selfie, right? Selfie

542
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:38,949
with what? With mittens on. Oh, mittens. He's a great thing about the mountains, human.

543
02:01:39,029 --> 02:01:50,699
You can't get two minutes to get a selfie and then we can go to the overlook and Pokemon sound.

544
02:01:50,699 --> 02:02:00,619
I heard a Pokemon sound. I can't. My voice is a little gone. Okay. Top of the morning to you,

545
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:07,420
human. This is the coolest you can get on vacation island. So settle in and get your chill on.

546
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:17,060
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Why is everybody saying Jack?

547
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:41,300
Who's where? That was Jacksepticeye? What? What was it? Hey, human. Have you heard the legend of

548
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:47,220
abominable snow bot? It is said to be an elusive bot that roams these very mountains.

549
02:02:47,939 --> 02:02:53,300
The few people who claim to have seen it say that it is very shy but has a special fondness for

550
02:02:53,300 --> 02:03:05,979
music. I thought I saw it once. Jackson. Jackson's a good dude. What are you talking about? Wait, no,

551
02:03:05,979 --> 02:03:27,399
no, no. Go back, back, back, back. I got it. That was a bad impression. Was it? That was, I just,

552
02:03:28,439 --> 02:03:42,739
was it a bad impression? He's got so much energy. It was good. I thought it was all right.

553
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,779
I mean, there's only one Jacksepticeye. It can't be me.

554
02:03:48,939 --> 02:03:54,220
Way to rock that classic winter look, human. Yeah, tell somebody to do an impression of me.

555
02:03:54,539 --> 02:04:01,260
Fantastic start to proving my role as the unique sibling. I've got a unique voice. You can't do me.

556
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:24,279
Leave me the fuck alone. I don't want to talk to any of you.

557
02:04:25,079 --> 02:04:34,279
I want to go to the overlook is what I want to do. Vacation bot tells me

558
02:04:34,279 --> 02:04:40,520
gondolas were the human's most efficient way to climb mountains. Enjoy. Yay. Great job, human.

559
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:45,319
We're on our way to see the rest of the mountain. Get on this gondola and throw that switch.

560
02:04:46,119 --> 02:04:59,539
VR games suck, lol. Oh, no, they don't. They're fucking fun.

561
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:12,380
Oh, I just leave. Welcome to the overlook, human.

562
02:05:12,939 --> 02:05:19,420
We're really high up, but the sun is even higher. Just remember, it's about the journey.

563
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:29,109
What do I want? Okay, we've got vanilla, mint chocolate chip, chocolate, strawberry fruit,

564
02:05:29,829 --> 02:05:41,850
orange cream, vanilla bean, rocky road. No. You know, I'm going to do three scoops.

565
02:05:42,409 --> 02:06:32,710
How do I turn the stream off? How do I turn the stream off right now? Wow, there's a maximum.

566
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:55,960
There's a maximum. All right, let's go. What is that? Ronald McDonald's skis.

567
02:06:55,960 --> 02:07:02,630
Oops, I just punched everybody in the face.

568
02:07:13,659 --> 02:07:14,939
Avoid the obstacles.

569
02:07:40,359 --> 02:07:53,750
Thousand points. One thousand.

570
02:08:55,239 --> 02:09:02,119
But now I can. Get it? It was you. A score like that deserves a pack.

571
02:09:02,119 --> 02:09:05,319
All right, let's go to the other. One more place to go to. And then this whole stream

572
02:09:05,319 --> 02:09:20,279
has been vacation simulator. Why? I can't stop. You're addicted to this.

573
02:09:21,239 --> 02:09:33,420
What about the memory? Ladder to the peak. What the fuck just happened? Current height?

574
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:37,819
Distance. First memory. I don't get it. Is this like Tetris?

575
02:10:03,899 --> 02:10:14,710
Rock climbing. Oh, I thought it was like Tetris. It sounds like you had quite the climb.

576
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:17,829
It would have been much more efficient if we had just installed an elevator.

577
02:10:17,829 --> 02:10:20,470
It's not really an accomplishment if you just skip to the end.

578
02:10:21,109 --> 02:10:23,829
Anyway, no peak is complete until you fly your flag.

579
02:10:23,829 --> 02:10:25,909
Oh, the flag. Go ahead and turn that tank

580
02:10:25,909 --> 02:10:36,340
to raise up the flagpole. Is that testament to human achievement?

581
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:40,140
Up high. All right, what is it? What's our flag?

582
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:55,189
Hey there. Okay, we did it. Now what?

583
02:10:55,189 --> 02:11:00,489
Now what? We did it. We climbed the highest peak on Vacation Island

584
02:11:00,489 --> 02:11:05,449
and flew the flag to prove it. This is so much more exhilarating than a memory.

585
02:11:05,449 --> 02:11:09,930
This doesn't make any sense. By all accounts, the human is doing great at vacation.

586
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:16,729
Why are the metrics getting worse? No, that can't be. This vacation is going so well.

587
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,930
Experiences are abstract, but metrics aren't.

588
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:23,689
The Bureau of Simulations could shut us down if the numbers drop low enough.

589
02:11:23,689 --> 02:11:26,970
I'm going to spend a few cycles figuring out what's happening.

590
02:11:26,970 --> 02:11:30,810
Is it going to turn into like a scary game? Well, I guess Efficiency Bot is busy crunching

591
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:34,649
the numbers. We'll wait here for them to come back so we can talk.

592
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:37,130
You can use that path to get back to Mountain Shop, human.

593
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:58,329
It's Aurora Borealis. We're going to achieve it at this time of day.

594
02:11:58,329 --> 02:12:03,130
All right, we got Forest. This is lore here, but I'm on vacation. I don't care.

595
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,130
I don't want to be burdened with the lore when I'm trying to relax.

596
02:12:13,529 --> 02:12:15,529
Painting? There's painting up there.

597
02:12:24,090 --> 02:12:28,729
Next game, President Sleeper. Hold on, I like this.

598
02:12:28,729 --> 02:12:32,729
We're just vacationing your way. We'll lead you to it.

599
02:12:32,729 --> 02:12:34,810
I love the little mini games. They're so much fun.

600
02:12:39,210 --> 02:13:22,010
Holy shit, this is cool. Look at that back. Oh, a photo. Oh, wow. Look at you. Why don't we?

601
02:13:22,010 --> 02:14:02,949
Hey, that's fun. Wait, it's you want it to be. You want green at the top and the whole.

602
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:28,340
This is green. I'm going to say one, two, three. Oh, fuck. Wrong.

603
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:33,340
Oh, hello there, human. Would you like to discover the digital canvas with me?

604
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:37,739
I'd like you to paint me a little painting. That's what I'm doing.

605
02:14:37,739 --> 02:14:39,340
Anything your heart desires.

606
02:14:40,220 --> 02:15:22,729
I'm painting the thing that you want. Pink, orange. This is so relaxing.

607
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:48,489
Light blue. Painting is fucking stupid. Why would you want this? OK, then this blue,

608
02:15:50,149 --> 02:16:53,739
right? Then yellow. Come on, get it. OK, now yellow. That's it. That's not what he wanted.

609
02:16:53,739 --> 02:17:06,819
He wanted this is a happy color palette. Fantastic, human. I feel the energy of this

610
02:17:06,819 --> 02:17:13,059
work. It truly represents narcolepsy. I could have just given him like a line across the

611
02:17:13,059 --> 02:17:17,139
canvas. The bots on the board would love to commission you to make them a painting.

612
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:32,709
OK, sure. I know exactly what I'm going to paint. Let's see if I get it. See if I get it from

613
02:17:32,709 --> 02:18:14,459
memory. Let's see if I get it from memory. I'm not going to look. Hey, that's one. There he is.

614
02:18:14,459 --> 02:19:13,909
Backpack. OK, now, um, fireman. Hey, fireman. Let's do fireman.

615
02:19:13,909 --> 02:20:01,510
Oh, his eyes are a little closer. No, it's not, right? All right. All right. Let's do one more.

616
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:32,389
OK, I'll try. I'll do the rat. I'll do the rat face. I'll do the mucker rat. Hey, what? Oh, shit.

617
02:21:03,750 --> 02:22:41,610
What else? Oh, it's the ear. Right. I fucked a zero. Here, you can have that one. It looks

618
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:46,250
like you could enrich the lives of some other bots with your art. Why don't you give this one

619
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:49,690
to one of the bots on this board? Oh, wait, I could do that. I'll do a gerbil heart too.

620
02:22:50,649 --> 02:24:18,149
It goes off screen. OK, and then let's go. I got a photo for you. Hey, have a fireman.

621
02:24:18,149 --> 02:24:22,790
That's going to be worth some money some day. Thank you, human. Now I can finally teach my bots.

622
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:27,989
Denial. I bet that bot Moss has more for you to do. Be sure to say hi for me.

623
02:24:28,709 --> 02:24:37,020
Oh, what's going on in this tent? OK, we got smores. Hey, hey, let me directly address you.

624
02:24:37,100 --> 02:25:01,399
Where am I? Of course, this is going to be sick. Hey, and you do, where's the, how do you turn this

625
02:25:01,399 --> 02:25:09,799
on? Wow, a real campfire. Look at that. Let me know when you're ready for a spooky story. No, no, no,

626
02:25:09,799 --> 02:25:12,280
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is wrong.

627
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:22,569
This is wrong. That's all right. This is how you make a smore, guys. Don't tell anyone. This is the

628
02:25:22,569 --> 02:25:26,170
actually correct way to do this. If you do it another way, it's wrong.

629
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:37,909
Chocolate, double chocolate. Very important. Get the other graham cracker ready. Have your

630
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:42,709
thing with the marshmallow on it. Roast the marshmallow. Don't put, don't do anything with

631
02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:56,940
this. Slowly. OK, there you go. Grab this shit. Squeeze it right there. Pull it back. Squish,

632
02:25:57,579 --> 02:26:04,780
squish, squish, squish. The chocolate's going to be still solid, but it'll be melty and tender.

633
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:07,500
It's not going to ooze all over you. You're going to go, much better.

634
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:13,739
This scared me and made me drop this shit. A long time ago in a simulated forest, just like this one,

635
02:26:13,739 --> 02:26:23,500
a bot family set up camp. Well, Kidbot heard a scraping noise coming from outside the campground.

636
02:26:23,579 --> 02:26:28,059
The family went to investigate. What are these, what are these, like, textureless sausages?

637
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:39,180
As parent bot looked closer, it suddenly latched onto this screen, and you, excuse me, Maria.

638
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:45,420
Audio processor. It's so dry. A human. Would you mind giving me a nice hot cup of liquid?

639
02:26:59,959 --> 02:27:04,200
I'm like, I'm like 10 years old. I'm older than you, and I shouldn't be acting that way.

640
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:34,760
100%. What I want. Oh, we can make tea. My niece does this. Every little kid has a little fake kid

641
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:42,120
guitar, and they just stand there and go, no, no, no, no. That's what I'm doing. This is my niece.

642
02:27:43,000 --> 02:28:26,659
It's prop island. I did it. I filled them all up. We got honey. Hot sauce. Hope it's Tabasco.

643
02:28:26,739 --> 02:28:40,309
Cool. Oh, cool. This is props. Oh, look at these props. Hey, human. Camping sucks.

644
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:46,549
My super dorky family is full, so he's made food for everything. I eat it raw. But what if you did

645
02:28:46,549 --> 02:28:52,010
it and I took all the credit, eh? It would just be like a group project. Game of Thrones actress?

646
02:28:54,819 --> 02:29:15,399
Camping sucks. Poodle? Wait. Prank? Why is that pranks? Cucumber coolant?

647
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:35,930
Food rehydrator. What are these? Oh, they're just little LEDs. Okay. What the fuck?

648
02:29:45,989 --> 02:29:55,719
This is Play-Doh. All right, here you go. Let's be your kid. Hey, you want this? I made you a

649
02:29:55,719 --> 02:30:06,299
Prado. I don't like it. I don't want to do anymore camera stuff. Garden. I can garden.

650
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:16,409
Maybe you should put something on my patented shrubifier. Then you can make some simple

651
02:30:16,409 --> 02:30:46,600
topiary. Your garden is really starting to blossom. But any fact, you can plant anything

652
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:52,569
in the ground and watch it grow. I know because I tried. You could make it a shrub though.

653
02:31:14,969 --> 02:31:26,950
I'm just having fun. I don't even know what's happening. All right, don't grow too much.

654
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:34,219
Your garden looks wonderful, human. Did I get a memory? It's gaming with carbon-based life

655
02:31:34,219 --> 02:31:38,299
forms. Oh, you know, so you can shrink it. Use a memory of your horticultural demonstration.

656
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:55,030
Okay, so now what? Feel free to swing by and enter your garden anytime.

657
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:59,350
It's fertile ground. Look at that guy. Oh, wait, is this a horn?

658
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:17,500
Okay, cool. One more place to go. And then I'm going to play a different game,

659
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:34,579
like fishing, fishing, fucking finally. Hey, remember the banana for the day? Remember that?

660
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:52,040
I think the fish change color. Oh, we need green. Fish change color when you give them food.

661
02:32:52,840 --> 02:33:09,559
Oh, I think they eat each other. That looks about right. Oh, here's some ancient fishing advice.

662
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:16,579
Hey, you just stole that out of my hand. It's like a seagull.

663
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:40,780
Ready? All right. Hey, this almost works, but it's not the right color.

664
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:51,690
Wow, that's yellow. Yellow trout. Oh, coin. I'll take that one. Ah, we've got you now, dick.

665
02:33:52,329 --> 02:34:00,170
I need that banana back. Give me that banana. Blue salmon.

666
02:34:02,649 --> 02:34:12,120
Am I eating this? All right, I'm going to catch a salmon.

667
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:20,020
To catch the right type of fish before we can give you credit.

668
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:29,620
A fish of all typecasts. So you have to find the right type of fish before we can give you credit.

669
02:34:32,219 --> 02:34:43,000
Herder riding? What? Come here, you little fuck. Catfish. Salmon.

670
02:34:49,239 --> 02:34:56,520
There's no better feeling in the world than finding what you're looking for yourself quietly.

671
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:01,290
Wow. There may be plenty of fish in the river, but I'm going to permanently

672
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:11,059
commit these to my memory storage. Thank you. That was fun. Is there anything else to do here?

673
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:21,610
I'm going to get all the memories. I'm over it. Oh, wait. Arm for coins. I think I did everything.

674
02:35:21,610 --> 02:35:30,459
Wait. Welcome to the welcome center. Well, come on in. This is too big.

675
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:36,659
And this machine will accept any official wood chips.

676
02:35:36,659 --> 02:35:39,540
I really want. I think I've seen some lying around in the forest.

677
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:47,239
In the fart one, right? How do you blow it up?

678
02:35:47,239 --> 02:36:01,239
Please, you grabbed my acorn bar and slingshot. Just pull back the string to fling.

679
02:36:01,959 --> 02:36:02,680
Give me a wave.

680
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:07,319
Most fun thing of the whole game. You waited to the very end. Show it to me.

681
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:21,290
This is so much fun. You beat Bart Simpson.

682
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:40,299
You take this currency. All right. New game.

683
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,899
I'm going to go piss, though, and I'm going to get some water.

684
02:36:43,899 --> 02:36:47,030
We'll play another one. This was fucking fun. I really like this.

685
02:36:52,149 --> 02:37:04,379
That back up on. But finally, he's all right. Let's move on.

686
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:08,729
I'll be right back. Just going to get something to drink and go pee.

687
02:40:37,479 --> 02:40:56,309
OK, we're going to do next. I have a shitload of games. Half Life Alex.

688
02:40:56,309 --> 02:41:05,659
No, we're doing that tomorrow. I've only probably got another hour or so in me in VR.

689
02:41:05,659 --> 02:41:14,940
Let's see. What can we do? Half Life Alex is tomorrow.

690
02:41:14,940 --> 02:41:19,159
I really want to start Half Life Alex and just do that.

691
02:41:19,159 --> 02:41:31,340
OK, close this. OK, we got. I'm going to throw out some things here.

692
02:41:31,340 --> 02:41:43,350
Let's see. I got Tap House VR. The room is going to be so much fun.

693
02:41:43,350 --> 02:41:51,590
I got a bunch of scary shit, too. Bone Works 2. That'll be probably soon.

694
02:41:54,379 --> 02:41:58,260
Pistol Whip. Oh, I want to try Pistol Whip.

695
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:05,450
I was told this game is really crazy. All right. Pistol Whip it is.

696
02:42:05,450 --> 02:42:12,299
Let's get it open. Is this putting a command prompt?

697
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:20,540
Scary game? Yeah, I'll do. We'll do a whole night of scary shit on VR.

698
02:42:20,540 --> 02:42:32,420
Ratatouille VR. That was a lot of fun, though. That was just chilling.

699
02:42:32,979 --> 02:42:35,459
I played that for three hours. I can't fucking believe that.

700
02:42:36,969 --> 02:42:44,170
When's Chubby Bunny? I don't know. I have to go get marshmallows.

701
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:51,319
So Pistol Whip, from my understanding, is a game where you have to VR shoot enemies to the beat.

702
02:42:51,319 --> 02:42:57,030
I think it's pretty flashy, too. So I think I'm going to give a warning here.

703
02:42:57,030 --> 02:43:00,790
It's probably an epileptic warning at the beginning of this game.

704
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:15,860
This is not a porn game. I've played it. It's a totally... It's an epileptic warning.

705
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:19,450
All right. Well, let's be real. It's probably going to be really...

706
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:22,950
Especially in VR, too. But I heard it was really fun.

707
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:27,799
I got a lot of recommendations from VR Josh. So he's given me some pretty good ones.

708
02:43:27,799 --> 02:43:34,680
So many VR games have come out over the last year and a half since I last played.

709
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:40,149
All right. Why is it taking so long? Performing first time setup with a command prompt open.

710
02:43:40,149 --> 02:43:41,909
Like, why do I... What is this?

711
02:43:41,909 --> 02:43:48,260
I've never played a Steam game that had a blank command prompt three times in a row.

712
02:43:48,260 --> 02:43:54,459
We good? All right. Here we go.

713
02:43:54,459 --> 02:43:56,299
Hopefully, this is not loud. I'm going to turn it down.

714
02:43:56,299 --> 02:44:00,819
Pistol Whip.

715
02:44:00,819 --> 02:44:16,969
You hear it? Okay. All right. I think we're good. I think I'm ready.

716
02:44:16,969 --> 02:44:30,389
Let's move this back over. Hello? Hi there. I'm going to go back in.

717
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:34,180
You might be able to turn down the flashiness in the settings. Really?

718
02:44:38,709 --> 02:44:44,950
He's going in. Not yet. I'm going in in about 15 seconds.

719
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:53,290
Start. Training. I probably should do the training, right?

720
02:44:55,350 --> 02:45:02,469
Keyboard mode. Dude's actually handsome.

721
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:10,520
All right. This is a good... I think this is a good spot to start.

722
02:45:11,459 --> 02:45:13,620
And like here. Like right here. This is pretty good.

723
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:19,799
Although I always like drift over to be out of frame like half the time. So...

724
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:32,180
Uh, all right. Get the right headphone, please.

725
02:45:32,899 --> 02:45:39,020
New modifiers. Vengeance and disorder.

726
02:45:46,709 --> 02:46:00,790
Oh, shit. He are Ratatouille waiting room.

727
02:46:00,790 --> 02:46:03,829
No, I didn't mean to shoot. All right. Now I got a real red dot.

728
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:14,739
Who's going to say Ratatouille waiting room? I can't get him.

729
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:22,659
All right. How do we do it? Training. Put on your straps.

730
02:46:22,659 --> 02:46:27,479
Oh, shit. Shoot enemy. Dodge bullets.

731
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:40,739
Aim down to reload. Losing armor.

732
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:46,340
Powered. Shoot enemies. Repair armor.

733
02:46:55,049 --> 02:47:03,719
Dodge. Duck. Dodge. Punch.

734
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:09,590
All right. I got to put this on. This game's sick.

735
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:12,229
Holy shit. This is a ton of fun. This is awesome.

736
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:18,329
I can't wait to play this. Modifiers. Player options. Game options.

737
02:47:19,129 --> 02:47:21,129
Scenes. Let's go right into one.

738
02:47:25,989 --> 02:47:37,989
Oh, I get the big one. I think this is the kind of gun that I would use.

739
02:47:37,989 --> 02:47:46,920
Like the James Bond movie. You just go... Oh my God.

740
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:48,840
No, not the Deagle. The Deagle's the meme gun.

741
02:47:49,799 --> 02:47:53,500
It's really loud. Where are you?

742
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:58,659
It's not really loud. I can see it.

743
02:47:59,219 --> 02:48:01,799
All right. I'm taking the little baby gun. Customize.

744
02:48:02,739 --> 02:48:09,219
Dude, what? Minecraft. Minecraft Creeper gun.

745
02:48:15,989 --> 02:48:21,670
Oh, this is the sound. Ooh.

746
02:48:22,709 --> 02:48:36,219
What do you think? I think I like five and four.

747
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:53,110
Five. Three's pretty good, too. I like five.

748
02:48:53,670 --> 02:49:05,159
Minecraft. Gone. Founder's collection.

749
02:49:05,959 --> 02:49:12,360
Ooh. Oh. Oh, this is John Wick.

750
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:22,979
All right. I'm going with this. I didn't go Ember's Another Day.

751
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:27,430
How about just the first one? How about Death?

752
02:49:44,260 --> 02:50:32,979
Oh. The dragon. Oh, I love it.

753
02:50:33,620 --> 02:51:49,100
Oh, shit. I lost hearing.

754
02:51:49,100 --> 02:52:29,020
I'm losing my hearing. I can't. I can't.

755
02:52:29,020 --> 02:53:03,420
I'm only hearing one ear. Oh my God.

756
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:10,059
He's reload Randy. He reloaded Randy.

757
02:53:11,350 --> 02:53:15,899
Holy shit. My underwear. Oh, there's a song.

758
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:35,879
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Oh.

759
02:53:44,659 --> 02:53:49,459
I think I'm back against the reddit shelf.

760
02:53:59,850 --> 02:54:01,129
Where should I move? Where should I move?

761
02:54:01,690 --> 02:54:12,229
Come on. I need this other hearing.

762
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:25,190
Fucking stupid ass thing, man. Look at this shit.

763
02:54:29,879 --> 02:54:31,639
I'm going to put these in until they hurt.

764
02:54:32,790 --> 02:54:38,520
Come on. Get in there and fucking stay in there.

765
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:46,760
Ugh. Dude, I can't even fucking aim.

766
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:49,159
If I go for this way, I'm going to smash the bottom.

767
02:54:49,159 --> 02:54:51,319
If I go this way, it's a fucking reddit shelf.

768
02:54:51,959 --> 02:56:08,489
Come on. Bang, bang, bang, bang.

769
02:56:14,709 --> 02:56:15,899
I can't hear anything.

770
02:56:54,389 --> 02:56:55,909
Oh, I hit my head on the ceiling.

771
02:57:22,649 --> 02:58:09,459
Oh, God. Come on.

772
02:58:09,459 --> 02:58:11,059
Better this time. Better this time.

773
02:58:11,059 --> 02:59:08,340
Come on, Wick. Okay. All right.

774
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:11,129
How much health do I have? How much health do I have?

775
02:59:17,819 --> 03:00:14,149
All right. Yes.

776
03:00:14,149 --> 03:00:19,479
He's going to need what? I got the baby.

777
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:22,920
I got a B. I got a B.

778
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:30,250
He's going to need another two months off.

779
03:00:30,250 --> 03:00:48,120
All right. Let's do the gun. Bolden gun.

780
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:56,649
Let's try. God fucking dammit. I feel like a warehouse.

781
03:00:56,649 --> 03:01:03,690
All right. Let's go.

782
03:01:03,690 --> 03:01:11,750
All right. How about revelations?

783
03:01:12,469 --> 03:01:31,100
Let's go.

784
03:01:31,100 --> 03:01:33,739
Tuber music. My hands are so sweaty.

785
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:54,569
The speed is fast.

786
03:02:20,229 --> 03:02:21,799
What songs are?

787
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:39,139
I'm like doing a K-pop song. Dance.

788
03:03:07,219 --> 03:03:10,100
That's not how you should come out of VR.

789
03:03:17,719 --> 03:03:21,079
That's not the best way to get removes from VR.

790
03:03:21,639 --> 03:03:24,649
Somebody just pulled my scalp off.

791
03:03:24,649 --> 03:03:26,250
I feel like I was just in a Scooby Doo movie

792
03:03:26,250 --> 03:03:27,850
and they just revealed me as the villain.

793
03:03:35,559 --> 03:03:36,280
I think we're okay.

794
03:03:41,989 --> 03:03:44,069
Like I was doing like a K-pop dance

795
03:03:44,069 --> 03:03:46,229
and I like lost my wig on stage.

796
03:03:48,219 --> 03:03:49,420
It's not broken. It's fine.

797
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:51,260
It's fine.

798
03:03:51,899 --> 03:03:55,659
That's because I stepped on the cord.

799
03:03:55,659 --> 03:03:56,620
It pulled back.

800
03:03:58,549 --> 03:04:00,090
Did you at least get to see it?

801
03:04:00,809 --> 03:04:02,729
Did you get to see the thing fly off?

802
03:04:02,729 --> 03:04:03,370
I hope so.

803
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:11,319
It doesn't help.

804
03:04:11,319 --> 03:04:13,479
My head is... Look at how sweaty I am.

805
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:16,040
This is the sweatiest I've ever been in my life.

806
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:18,200
Of course it's going to be greased up and be able to fly off.

807
03:04:19,399 --> 03:04:24,100
This game is a lot of fun too.

808
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:26,409
Shit. Watch the clip.

809
03:04:27,049 --> 03:04:44,549
I'm like doing a K-pop song. Dance.

810
03:05:05,459 --> 03:05:07,379
Dude, it looks like it wasn't even on.

811
03:05:07,379 --> 03:05:10,180
It looks like it was just barely on my fucking face.

812
03:05:10,899 --> 03:05:13,540
It was attached tight as hell.

813
03:05:36,219 --> 03:05:44,120
Okay, I'm going to get back into the game.

814
03:05:50,200 --> 03:05:50,920
Show the clip.

815
03:05:50,920 --> 03:05:51,479
Hold on.

816
03:05:51,479 --> 03:05:54,329
Let me see if I can get it on screen.

817
03:05:54,329 --> 03:05:55,370
No, we'll do it later.

818
03:05:55,370 --> 03:05:56,010
I'm almost like...

819
03:05:56,969 --> 03:06:01,030
I can't fucking believe this is happening.

820
03:06:01,030 --> 03:06:01,750
Do normal?

821
03:06:06,739 --> 03:06:08,659
Pressing the eject button in VR.

822
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,559
Okay, that's like...

823
03:06:11,559 --> 03:06:12,600
Press that button.

824
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:13,319
Mom's home.

825
03:06:13,319 --> 03:06:15,719
You haven't finished your homework yet and you're in VR

826
03:06:15,719 --> 03:06:18,520
and you got to fucking open up like a word pad real quick

827
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:19,639
and write a bunch of bullshit.

828
03:06:21,700 --> 03:06:22,579
Alright, let's get back in.

829
03:06:23,219 --> 03:06:29,579
I was doing really well there too.

830
03:06:29,579 --> 03:06:31,420
I was doing really good.

831
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:43,879
There's no way.

832
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:51,510
Oh, look.

833
03:06:52,149 --> 03:06:52,889
I died.

834
03:06:53,450 --> 03:06:59,270
Destroying VR headset to farm plus twos.

835
03:06:59,909 --> 03:07:01,459
Click the link, please.

836
03:07:01,459 --> 03:07:02,579
Omega lul.

837
03:07:02,579 --> 03:07:03,219
Okay, hold on.

838
03:07:03,940 --> 03:07:06,040
How do I have hair in my mouth?

839
03:07:11,879 --> 03:07:13,159
Okay, this is fucking funny.

840
03:07:19,290 --> 03:07:24,170
This looks like if you woke somebody up out of a deep sleep

841
03:07:24,969 --> 03:07:29,219
instantly, they were sleeping and you just shook them hard

842
03:07:29,219 --> 03:07:31,219
and said, dude, wake the fuck up.

843
03:07:31,219 --> 03:07:52,090
Look at the hair being pulled back too.

844
03:07:55,659 --> 03:07:56,860
Like a sleepwalker.

845
03:07:58,120 --> 03:07:59,399
Oh my god, the sleepwalker.

846
03:07:59,399 --> 03:08:01,079
He's like holding a gun in his dream.

847
03:08:01,079 --> 03:08:02,680
What the fuck is going on over there?

848
03:08:06,389 --> 03:08:07,350
Alright, speaking of...

849
03:08:07,350 --> 03:08:09,510
I got to like increase the brightness on this fucking thing.

850
03:08:10,069 --> 03:08:17,479
This looks like shit.

851
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:19,639
Why am I like in a shadow?

852
03:08:19,639 --> 03:08:20,200
Oh, there we go.

853
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:20,760
No, I'm not.

854
03:08:20,760 --> 03:08:23,190
I still need to brighten it up.

855
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:26,260
Dying.

856
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:29,290
Okay, there we go.

857
03:08:29,290 --> 03:08:36,100
Okay, let's try this again.

858
03:08:36,659 --> 03:08:44,329
You fell asleep with your bike helmet on?

859
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:47,139
Stay away from the Reddit collection.

860
03:08:47,139 --> 03:08:50,500
Yeah, that was a lot going on in that last fucking 20 minutes.

861
03:08:51,059 --> 03:08:59,459
Funko alert?

862
03:08:59,459 --> 03:08:59,940
What's wrong?

863
03:09:00,579 --> 03:09:04,680
There's a gif now?

864
03:09:06,500 --> 03:09:07,299
It's alright.

865
03:09:07,299 --> 03:09:08,500
Alright, I got to be ready for this

866
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:09,620
because this is going to rip the fuck out.

867
03:09:09,620 --> 03:09:11,139
No more like K-pop dancing.

868
03:09:11,139 --> 03:09:11,780
That would be nice.

869
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:18,459
Check the gif.

870
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:21,219
Show gif, show gif, show gif.

871
03:09:34,250 --> 03:09:40,659
This thing, this strap doesn't work, man.

872
03:09:40,659 --> 03:09:41,930
I'm telling you.

873
03:09:41,930 --> 03:10:08,120
Let's see the whole thing.

874
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:10,280
Well, hopefully there's nothing actually wrong with this

875
03:10:10,280 --> 03:10:12,920
because that fell from like six feet high.

876
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:17,540
It's wet in here.

877
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:26,200
Hey, everyone was like, dude, just get an index.

878
03:10:26,200 --> 03:10:27,239
The index is way better.

879
03:10:27,239 --> 03:10:29,479
Well, I don't need to do that now.

880
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:32,700
Alright, I'm back.

881
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:34,139
This game is so much fun.

882
03:10:34,139 --> 03:10:34,780
I'm going to relax.

883
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:36,219
I'm getting just too into it.

884
03:10:36,219 --> 03:10:39,850
What the fuck did I just do?

885
03:10:40,329 --> 03:10:44,059
No, get this off.

886
03:10:44,059 --> 03:10:44,860
What button did I press?

887
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,620
How do I turn this off?

888
03:10:48,180 --> 03:10:50,469
How do I turn this off?

889
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:54,940
I'm going to lose all my hair in the front of my fucking head.

890
03:10:54,940 --> 03:10:55,420
I know it.

891
03:10:56,139 --> 03:10:59,340
I'm going to lose all my fucking hair.

892
03:11:00,629 --> 03:11:01,190
Inevitable.

893
03:11:03,049 --> 03:11:04,649
Okay, return to game.

894
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:07,940
Okay, you guys can hear it, right?

895
03:11:07,940 --> 03:11:09,219
I didn't like unplug any cords.

896
03:11:10,409 --> 03:11:11,290
Get this behind us.

897
03:11:12,010 --> 03:11:13,750
I say us, I mean me.

898
03:11:15,850 --> 03:11:16,809
Okay, you still there?

899
03:11:17,530 --> 03:11:20,549
Still there?

900
03:11:21,350 --> 03:11:22,229
You are.

901
03:11:22,229 --> 03:11:23,030
Alright.

902
03:11:23,030 --> 03:11:27,299
Am I in a good spot?

903
03:11:27,860 --> 03:11:34,709
I'm not going to move.

904
03:11:35,430 --> 03:11:41,100
I'm going to do it like Doom.

905
03:12:45,059 --> 03:13:32,659
Go.

906
03:13:32,659 --> 03:13:33,860
Yeah, you fucking asshole.

907
03:13:34,979 --> 03:13:43,750
That was loud.

908
03:13:43,750 --> 03:13:45,420
I just screamed.

909
03:13:45,420 --> 03:13:46,459
I need a different gun.

910
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:47,899
I don't want this song.

911
03:13:47,899 --> 03:13:59,780
I don't like this song.

912
03:13:59,780 --> 03:14:00,100
Boom.

913
03:14:01,770 --> 03:14:02,090
Kick.

914
03:14:05,399 --> 03:14:06,760
Yes, fucking dead man.

915
03:14:07,479 --> 03:14:14,170
Two gun mode?

916
03:14:14,170 --> 03:14:14,729
What?

917
03:14:14,729 --> 03:15:25,879
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

918
03:15:25,879 --> 03:15:26,760
Oh shit.

919
03:15:26,760 --> 03:15:28,600
Make sure you play this to father gas going.

920
03:15:29,399 --> 03:16:55,930
Win?

921
03:16:55,930 --> 03:16:56,569
Yo.

922
03:16:56,569 --> 03:16:59,049
Uh, yo.

923
03:16:59,049 --> 03:17:02,860
The 99% on beat accuracy.

924
03:17:02,860 --> 03:17:08,809
Can I do two?

925
03:17:09,370 --> 03:17:14,100
A laser gun?

926
03:17:17,110 --> 03:17:17,829
Super soaker?

927
03:17:18,629 --> 03:17:21,829
Merry Christmas?

928
03:17:22,870 --> 03:17:25,379
I'll do a Merry Christmas gun.

929
03:17:25,940 --> 03:17:31,610
Kind of like a candy cane.

930
03:17:32,649 --> 03:17:37,159
What else we got?

931
03:17:39,319 --> 03:17:39,719
Aptics.

932
03:17:40,520 --> 03:17:54,409
Turn on dual weld?

933
03:17:56,489 --> 03:17:57,530
Dual weld?

934
03:17:57,530 --> 03:17:58,170
How do I do that?

935
03:18:02,260 --> 03:18:04,100
I'm wearing like a club right now.

936
03:18:04,100 --> 03:18:05,139
I have things in my ears.

937
03:18:05,860 --> 03:18:06,899
Modifiers.

938
03:18:06,899 --> 03:18:13,079
Wait, how do I get there?

939
03:18:20,620 --> 03:18:21,100
Welders?

940
03:18:22,459 --> 03:18:24,459
No fail dead eye.

941
03:18:27,510 --> 03:18:28,069
Scavenger?

942
03:18:31,020 --> 03:18:31,739
Oh shit.

943
03:18:34,229 --> 03:18:34,950
Oh man.

944
03:18:35,750 --> 03:18:40,069
Hey, hat's on, right?

945
03:18:42,569 --> 03:18:43,610
I'm going to get these little ones.

946
03:18:44,649 --> 03:18:49,899
Run on spot welding?

947
03:18:49,899 --> 03:18:50,620
I don't know what that means.

948
03:18:52,409 --> 03:18:53,290
All right, let's go.

949
03:18:53,290 --> 03:18:53,930
On hard.

950
03:18:53,930 --> 03:18:55,049
This is fucking hard, boy.

951
03:19:59,670 --> 03:20:00,170
Bang.

952
03:20:49,479 --> 03:20:50,040
No.

953
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:51,270
Oh, that's hard.

954
03:20:51,989 --> 03:20:53,430
Holy shit.

955
03:20:53,430 --> 03:21:04,219
We're going back to normal, boys and girls.

956
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:41,959
Let's go.

957
03:21:41,959 --> 03:22:17,959
Oh shit.

958
03:22:47,100 --> 03:22:47,979
Sloppy.

959
03:22:47,979 --> 03:22:48,479
Sloppy.

960
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:50,000
Sloppy.

961
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:51,180
Sloppy.

962
03:22:51,180 --> 03:22:51,680
Sloppy.

963
03:22:52,059 --> 03:22:53,579
The house is on fire at The Sims.

964
03:22:54,459 --> 03:23:53,670
Oh my god.

965
03:24:20,280 --> 03:24:42,659
I feel something behind me.

966
03:24:58,520 --> 03:24:59,639
Oh my god.

967
03:25:06,309 --> 03:25:06,870
Eh.

968
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:16,280
I'm doing over 4550 for the best person in the fuck.

969
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:16,840
I'm tired.

970
03:25:17,559 --> 03:25:29,180
All right, I'm going to do one more.

971
03:25:33,299 --> 03:25:44,440
Damn.

972
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:53,500
Okay, that's good.

973
03:25:57,479 --> 03:25:58,200
Holy shit.

974
03:26:06,280 --> 03:26:06,840
Big bits?

975
03:26:08,020 --> 03:26:09,620
250 fucking dollars.

976
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:10,979
Who gave 250 bucks?

977
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:15,860
Listen, I like this one's easy, right?

978
03:26:16,420 --> 03:26:31,059
What's the beat?

979
03:26:32,100 --> 03:26:49,420
This way.

980
03:26:54,659 --> 03:27:49,940
Fuck you.

981
03:27:49,940 --> 03:28:02,520
All right, I'm going to do it sitting down.

982
03:28:03,079 --> 03:28:52,120
Not even stand up and reload.

983
03:28:53,000 --> 03:35:09,899
Hold on.

984
03:35:09,899 --> 03:35:13,659
Have I been doing VR in like tiny bri-ball brain mode?

985
03:35:13,659 --> 03:35:20,219
Average is 64.

986
03:35:20,219 --> 03:35:21,340
Oh, then I'm good.

987
03:35:21,340 --> 03:35:30,040
Yeah, I had it on 64.

988
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:30,600
Yeah, I'm good.

989
03:35:31,159 --> 03:35:33,690
And use your phone to measure it.

990
03:35:34,250 --> 03:35:39,739
I think I'm done.

991
03:35:40,299 --> 03:35:41,979
I don't think I can do anymore.

992
03:35:41,979 --> 03:35:45,379
Has it been like four hours?

993
03:35:45,940 --> 03:35:47,379
I really wanted to get to four.

994
03:35:48,600 --> 03:35:50,200
I really want to get to four hours.

995
03:35:50,840 --> 03:35:59,270
He's weak.

996
03:36:00,299 --> 03:36:01,020
Yeah.

997
03:36:01,020 --> 03:36:01,579
Yeah, I am.

998
03:36:05,930 --> 03:36:07,450
Yeah, I'm going to call it.

999
03:36:07,450 --> 03:36:08,649
I'm going back tomorrow.

1000
03:36:08,649 --> 03:36:10,090
We're going to do Half-Life Alex tomorrow.

1001
03:36:10,090 --> 03:36:11,370
I feel like there's not going to be a whole lot of

1002
03:36:12,329 --> 03:36:14,329
diving around like a psychopath

1003
03:36:14,329 --> 03:36:16,729
and dancing to music for an hour straight.

1004
03:36:16,729 --> 03:36:20,200
That was a ton of fun though.

1005
03:36:20,200 --> 03:36:21,799
I forgot how much fun this fucking really was.

1006
03:36:22,520 --> 03:36:25,739
Oh dear goodness.

1007
03:36:25,739 --> 03:36:26,219
I need to tell you.

1008
03:36:26,219 --> 03:36:28,219
I'm going to hop in the shower as soon as this is over.

1009
03:36:31,299 --> 03:36:32,739
It looks like I already did take a shower.

1010
03:36:33,459 --> 03:36:35,059
It looks like I just got out of the shower.

1011
03:36:36,379 --> 03:36:37,340
Doesn't it?

1012
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:39,530
Looks like I just got out.

1013
03:36:39,530 --> 03:36:43,959
Holy shit.

1014
03:36:43,959 --> 03:36:44,680
Yeah, I know, man.

1015
03:36:45,319 --> 03:36:46,389
I know, man.

1016
03:36:46,389 --> 03:36:46,870
Seriously.

1017
03:36:50,579 --> 03:36:51,540
You jelled?

1018
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:52,020
I'm wet.

1019
03:36:52,020 --> 03:36:53,620
Yeah, I'm actually physically wet.

1020
03:36:56,860 --> 03:36:57,260
All right.

1021
03:36:57,979 --> 03:37:02,229
I do want to say Foxymuffin gave $250 fucking dollars.

1022
03:37:02,969 --> 03:37:03,690
That's insane.

1023
03:37:04,649 --> 03:37:06,329
Longtime fan decided to actually support you.

1024
03:37:06,329 --> 03:37:06,649
Keep it up.

1025
03:37:06,649 --> 03:37:08,569
That's 25,000 bits.

1026
03:37:08,569 --> 03:37:09,850
That's too much money.

1027
03:37:09,850 --> 03:37:12,010
I'll take it though.

1028
03:37:12,010 --> 03:37:14,010
I mean, that's unnecessary, but I'll take it.

1029
03:37:14,010 --> 03:37:16,170
That's a lot of money.

1030
03:37:16,170 --> 03:37:17,770
Thank you for the $250.

1031
03:37:17,770 --> 03:37:18,409
Holy shit.

1032
03:37:18,969 --> 03:37:21,180
Goiki gave $50.

1033
03:37:21,180 --> 03:37:23,260
Draw my fursona in VR when I play Tilt Brush.

1034
03:37:23,260 --> 03:37:24,459
Remind me, I will.

1035
03:37:24,459 --> 03:37:25,670
Thanks for the 50 bucks.

1036
03:37:25,670 --> 03:37:28,629
Freddy Dredd gave 50 community subs and Lovely...

1037
03:37:28,629 --> 03:37:33,340
What if I just went boom and passed out?

1038
03:37:34,379 --> 03:37:35,979
Lovely and Jubbly gave $50 too.

1039
03:37:35,979 --> 03:37:36,940
My heart is broken.

1040
03:37:36,940 --> 03:37:38,299
No far cry.

1041
03:37:38,299 --> 03:37:41,940
Probably not.

1042
03:37:41,940 --> 03:37:45,540
That game is fucking hard and broken and annoying.

1043
03:37:45,540 --> 03:37:50,840
It was fun in 2004.

1044
03:37:50,840 --> 03:37:51,159
Maybe.

1045
03:37:52,280 --> 03:37:52,920
He lied.

1046
03:37:54,040 --> 03:37:54,680
Yeah, I know.

1047
03:37:54,680 --> 03:37:55,239
That's what I do.

1048
03:37:56,969 --> 03:37:57,850
All right, guys.

1049
03:37:57,850 --> 03:37:58,649
I will see you later.

1050
03:37:58,649 --> 03:38:00,409
We're going to run the credits.

1051
03:38:00,409 --> 03:38:02,729
And I'm going to just get up and fucking go in the shower.

1052
03:38:02,729 --> 03:38:06,260
I'm dying.

1053
03:38:06,260 --> 03:38:07,540
Here come all the subs from today.

1054
03:38:07,940 --> 03:38:09,290
Thank you, everybody.

1055
03:38:13,030 --> 03:38:13,670
Really appreciate it.

1056
03:38:13,670 --> 03:38:15,750
This channel has tons and tons of subs.

1057
03:38:15,750 --> 03:38:18,309
You guys continue to support this channel with tons of money.

1058
03:38:18,870 --> 03:38:20,149
Hopefully, I spent it well.

1059
03:38:20,149 --> 03:38:20,950
I'll try to.

1060
03:38:21,670 --> 03:38:23,239
Thanks a lot, though.

1061
03:38:23,239 --> 03:38:26,659
Seriously.

1062
03:38:26,659 --> 03:38:27,540
VR is a ton of fun.

1063
03:38:27,540 --> 03:38:29,700
You'll see Half-Life Alex will be tomorrow.

1064
03:38:29,700 --> 03:38:33,049
I just kind of wanted to get used to VR again

1065
03:38:33,049 --> 03:38:38,659
before I jumped right into the best VR game that's ever been made.

1066
03:38:38,659 --> 03:38:41,909
So tomorrow should be pretty solid.

1067
03:38:41,909 --> 03:38:48,459
Thanks again, everybody.

1068
03:38:48,459 --> 03:38:50,440
Same time tomorrow?

1069
03:38:50,440 --> 03:38:52,870
Yeah, we'll probably start around 2 p.m. tomorrow.

1070
03:38:52,870 --> 03:38:53,590
Pacific.

1071
03:38:53,590 --> 03:38:55,379
I was going to start around 1,

1072
03:38:55,379 --> 03:38:57,459
but I had to go do an errand.

1073
03:38:57,459 --> 03:38:58,500
I had to run out of the house.

1074
03:38:58,500 --> 03:39:07,100
Make sure your PC can actually run Half-Life Alex.

1075
03:39:07,100 --> 03:39:07,819
Wait, what?

1076
03:39:07,819 --> 03:39:12,180
What do you mean?

1077
03:39:12,180 --> 03:39:13,139
Add good graphics.

1078
03:39:13,139 --> 03:39:15,700
Wait, is it really taxing on the computer?

1079
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:19,319
Will a 1080 work?

1080
03:39:19,319 --> 03:39:25,530
That should be fine.

1081
03:39:28,389 --> 03:39:33,850
1080 is fine.

1082
03:39:33,850 --> 03:39:34,170
Okay.

1083
03:39:34,170 --> 03:39:34,889
Yes, idiot.

1084
03:39:34,889 --> 03:39:35,610
It's in VR.

1085
03:39:36,729 --> 03:39:37,850
Why did you call me an idiot?

1086
03:39:38,489 --> 03:39:40,090
I'm not the one that said it wasn't going to work.

1087
03:39:42,250 --> 03:39:43,450
Why am I the idiot?

1088
03:39:43,450 --> 03:39:44,969
I was just reacting to what they said.

1089
03:39:46,170 --> 03:39:54,979
I use 1080 at max graphics,

1090
03:39:54,979 --> 03:40:00,139
but streaming also bogs up the system.

1091
03:40:00,139 --> 03:40:01,020
Well, I just won't run it.

1092
03:40:01,020 --> 03:40:08,329
I won't do max graphics.

1093
03:40:08,329 --> 03:40:09,690
Thanks, everybody.

1094
03:40:09,690 --> 03:40:12,649
I am going to run away right now and just go into the shower.

1095
03:40:15,700 --> 03:40:16,579
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1096
03:40:16,579 --> 03:40:18,260
Probably same time for Half-Life Alex,

1097
03:40:18,260 --> 03:40:20,180
unless it can't run on my computer.

1098
03:40:20,180 --> 03:40:25,239
Take care of yourselves, guys.

1099
03:40:25,879 --> 03:40:30,700
Have a great rest of your day or night, depending on where you are.

1100
03:40:30,700 --> 03:41:29,850
I'll see you tomorrow.
