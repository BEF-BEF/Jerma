1
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:29,019
Not that late, a little bit late. I just wanted to do a last minute check. I had to take auto out

2
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:33,820
and then I wanted to make sure these are all... I messed up the way the images came through,

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,740
so I had to re kind of put them in the right place. But we're live now. How are you? Good afternoon.

4
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:50,380
It is currently 2 1 2 Pacific. I don't know what time it is for you, but hopefully it's in a nice

5
00:00:50,380 --> 00:01:00,630
time. Omega lull. Right off the bat, already got a couple of omega lulls. It's gonna be a good one

6
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,859
tonight! Uh yeah, we're gonna do a community content night. My throat's a little scratchy

7
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:19,269
because I've had a cold, but I've had a 20% cold for like 10 days. It won't become a cold,

8
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:31,959
but it won't stop. It won't leave me alone. Maybe it's the air. I started to develop this after the

9
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,780
slime stream. It's just like, get at it! Like give me the cold and let's get it over with.

10
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:56,540
He's turning. Not yet. Not yet. We'll see. You got slime-itis. No, but uh again, this is the second

11
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:05,530
time we're gonna be doing this. Expect this stream to be somewhere around a few hours, three or four

12
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,969
hours. This is what we're doing. Community content only. If you don't know what that is, go to the

13
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,419
discord. Read the pin on the community content discord page. You can find out what we're doing.

14
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:26,150
Art, videos, music, community themed. There were a lot of submissions. Tried to go through and get

15
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:38,740
as many as I could in for today. All right, so let's go ahead and move over here. We're just

16
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,069
gonna get started. Yeah, there's gonna be a cam today. I promise. There you go. You ready?

17
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:58,729
Um, there'll be a camera today. I didn't say which one though. This is the first one. This is the

18
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,289
first- we're gonna start with images. I don't know what the- I- is that pic- I don't know if

19
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:15,139
that's pixel me, but here's real me. How are you? Good afternoon. Uh, so make that face. I did that

20
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:20,659
face again. I'm never making that face again. I've done that face twice and it has become

21
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:29,110
just- there's a worse one. I look like it's gross in this picture too. I've talked about how this

22
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:40,039
is my least favorite photo a dozen times. Do it. Do it. No, the- the greedy grinner is not worse

23
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:45,000
than this. I'm gonna have to put like the evidence forward. This is the worst picture that exists of

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,169
me with like more than a hundred upvotes, but this is the one we're starting with. Derma face tier

25
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,780
list. I can't do that. Hold on. Let me just- everybody thinks I'm gross before drinking, like

26
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:11,349
I put blood in water, whatever. Uh, all right, let's get- let's go. This is number one. Again,

27
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:17,480
I want to make this very clear. Make sure you watermark your images. It's got to be on Imgur

28
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,980
and- or it's got to be on YouTube. Make- put- you got to put a little thing down here

29
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:31,259
that says like, Dan, you know, what- I do- whoever you are. What? What did I say? Imgur.

30
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:39,420
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, folks. Imgur. Imgur. That's too many things to say.

31
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:49,560
Imgur. No. Imgur. It's so much easier. Even if it's wrong, I'm still gonna do it. There are people

32
00:04:49,560 --> 00:05:01,560
that say jup instead of jup. So, am I gonna change those people's minds? No. I say Imgur.

33
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Fuck dumbass shithead. Oh my god. All right, let's take a look at the next- I gotta get this image

34
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,199
off the screen before it's like, again, the number one thing that comes up when you type in Derma

35
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:18,180
into any search. That's what it is. All right, this is the next image coming up. Fireman. Look

36
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,959
at this dude. Everybody loves Fireman. Of all the things, like, everybody just loves this character.

37
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:39,620
This is one of quite a few good Firemans tonight. He's awesome. Look at this dude. Very good

38
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:49,819
Fireman. I like the little rosy cheeks here. It's a nice touch. And I make that face. I do this all

39
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:55,160
the time. I always have this little, like, shit-eating grin on. I just did it right there.

40
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:07,660
Shito. I think we may have seen this one already, but it's still very good. Rest in peace,

41
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:19,420
Shito. What's wrong with Shito? Shito's batteries are dead, but that's all right. How do you zoom?

42
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,620
It's control plus, right? There we go. Shito's batteries are dead, but here's the thing about

43
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:35,939
inanimate objects. If you put new batteries in, they just wake up. It's like going under anesthesia.

44
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:41,990
They just get up. They're just up now. And they keep all their memories. Everything's fine.

45
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,129
Shito could sit in, like, a suitcase for, like, 10 years, and I just put batteries in, and it's

46
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,610
just like he opens his eyes from the last time he was turned off. And he's like, I'm fine. I'm

47
00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:05,100
alive. I'm fine. Wake him up. Maybe one day. That's Toy Story 5. What a great idea for a Toy Story

48
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:17,589
sequel. That's fantastic. Have Woody just wake up in, like, 2060, and he has to deal with the

49
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,430
future, and he just, hey, all of his memories are from, you could do a whole future thing with that.

50
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,579
His batteries died. Yeah, that would be perfect. I would go see that movie.

51
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,730
The Wall-E future? No, it just had to be, like, a regular future. Not the Wall-E future. We're not

52
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,910
going to get, guys, we're not going to get that advanced. We've plateaued, I think, in a lot of

53
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,149
technology. It's going to take, like, a hundred more years before we get, like, a real new, like,

54
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:55,209
plateau of technology. I disagree. All right, let's keep going. That was Shito. Good. They watermarked.

55
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:13,319
I mean, it, that's me. That is me. Although I don't know if my, like, jaw is that. Maybe it was.

56
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:23,850
When I look at some of these images, I just go, like, is that, like, that's me? Man, I guess I

57
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:30,060
look like that, huh? That's a great style, though. I love, you know what I like about this one?

58
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:40,059
This part, right down here. I love this, this shadow. This, like, neon shadow. I love what you

59
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,860
do with the chin, because that's the extent of the amount of hair that I can grow on my face.

60
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,970
You nailed it. I don't have enough gamer neck. I don't, what do you mean gamer? I don't need gamer

61
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,179
neck for this. I can sit like that. And that's what my, look at my throat. That's what my throat

62
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:09,720
looks like, too. Like, bumpy and fucked up looking. I am, okay, I am such a bumpy person.

63
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Like, what you see right here is what it looks like the whole way down. I'm just, like,

64
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,860
covered in, like, little, like, bumps and, like, loose skin. I do not look good naked.

65
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:33,460
No, I'm not kidding. Yeah, I do. No, not like a toad. Maybe it is kind of, no, it is like a toad.

66
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,909
No, it's not. Let's find out. Okay, what if I show you, okay, is it, no, that's illegal. I can't do

67
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:47,590
that. Just like, let me show you. That would be really bad. What do you think about this?

68
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:59,350
Illegal. No, I'm really, like, bumpy and, like, coarse. Like, when you touch my arm, it's like

69
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:09,529
sandpaper. It's like, ah, fuck, that's like, that's rough. I like this image a lot. It's very good.

70
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:17,029
Very, very good. Give me the watermark. Streamer go, well, there it is. Streamer goes insane.

71
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:31,980
I like this one here. I don't even, I don't even have to do anything. It's already there. Look at

72
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:46,139
that, like, in my stomach line, too. That is what it looks like. What is that? The old toothbrush,

73
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:54,779
I remember this one. That, like, that's the fart face? This, ah, this is the fart face, isn't it?

74
00:10:55,419 --> 00:11:01,379
And of course, being bagsonic, I like the blue and the blue. That ties the whole thing together.

75
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,899
They pop, and then you add a little bit of, a little bit of green over here,

76
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,259
which your eye goes like this. This is how this works, guys. Trust me, I know how to, I know art.

77
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,820
Your eye, the artist decided to put the colors, pop it out like this, so your eye goes like this.

78
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,059
See what I just did? Oh, bang, bang, bang, bang, right there. Bang, bang, bang, bang, right there.

79
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:33,720
Your eye is one, two, three, four points across the paper. Don't you ask the artist. See?

80
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,990
Like, they're here right now? Yeah, that's why I did that. It's a good composition. I like it.

81
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,470
Very good. A lot of, a lot of moments. A lot of, like, a Twitter picture.

82
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:56,389
I don't think that, that many people are gonna like that photo, but they did. Your chin's not big

83
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:03,690
enough. It's huge right here. Like, my nose is, is, like, right outside, and then my chin, like,

84
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,970
touches the top of my nose, like, per minute. If you took a ruler and go like this, it'll hit

85
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:19,929
the bottom of my chin. See? Because it comes out. I fart like a banana. There isn't a ruler long

86
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:33,240
enough. Get out of here. Rude. All right, there's a, there's a, look, wait for this one. Ready?

87
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:45,370
So, this is, just watch it. Ready? Let's add the bottom teeth. Two submissions here. One,

88
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:53,190
one of the top row, and then finishing it with the bottom row. You gotta complete the photo.

89
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:04,779
My teeth aren't like that. Imagine you had teeth like that. Your mouth would just be constantly

90
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:10,629
bleeding. Blood would just be pouring out of your mouth at all times. It would just be like, ah!

91
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,169
Blood would just be filling your mouth, and you'd just have to spit. You'd have to carry,

92
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:20,649
like, you'd have to carry one of these around, and like, you just wouldn't, you'd have to keep

93
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:33,610
your mouth closed like this, and talk through here. Otherwise, you'd just get hurt. Blood bottle.

94
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:40,820
It's tea. It's tea. I'm drinking tea. But no, that's, I like these two because you,

95
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,059
the second submission has the bottom teeth. It's like, oh, fuck! I forgot to, I forgot the bottom

96
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:53,850
row of teeth! All right, I got, I got it now. It's there now. Let's keep going. This is when I won

97
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:03,940
the vine wrestle. It's the belt right there. You'd have to wear a mouth guard. Yeah, you just have to

98
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:13,779
have like a constant mouth guard on. CM Jerem. That was a lot of fun. I was happy to participate.

99
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:25,539
It was a great day. This is glue man. Who is this? What, what actual character is this? I don't,

100
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:33,500
I don't know who that is. What's the actual wrestler? It's glue man. No, behind the mask.

101
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:45,860
It's the dude, it's just a dude next to CM Punk. That's not a wrestler. This is like a fan. Wait,

102
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,259
is this somebody just getting in the photo? Like, leaning in? How would they be here?

103
00:14:53,049 --> 00:15:02,710
They were just in the crowd. Oh, I thought this is like two wrestlers. Whatever. Oh wait, this is

104
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,870
awesome! I forgot this is like the Jupiter Storm. I should have, bye, I didn't, I wouldn't. Let's

105
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:15,370
just sit here for a minute. This is great. So this is a Jupiter Storm. Really a little screen saver.

106
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,110
I think it's great. You know what would be really awesome is if whoever made this, whoever programmed

107
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:28,549
this, to make it so it would count the Jupiters that are happening in chat. How many completed

108
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:34,389
ones happened? And that's the ones that ran down. That would be awesome. Oh, there's also gnomes

109
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:43,850
here, but who cares about those? We can remove those. Chat is feeding them back to the sky.

110
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,220
But yeah, this is really cool. It's just like a little screen saver. I think it's random too.

111
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,100
Seems like it is. Let's see. Is it random? They're just kind of, yeah, I think it is.

112
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:06,629
Different distances and stuff. No, it's not. Are you sure? I don't know about that. Let's see if

113
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:12,470
that happens again. No, it is absolutely just whatever, wherever they go. See? Look at that.

114
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,779
Here they come. See? They go down and then at the bottom and then they start at the top.

115
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:25,220
Watch the gnomes. Why do I feel like if I sit here for long enough, it's going to scream at me.

116
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:37,059
I don't think it is. It's just going to go like boop. It's really cool though.

117
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:47,299
This is a photo of a photo that somebody did I think in a class or something. Green light means

118
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:59,990
go. It's me T posing and then T posing J's. Is this a classroom meme? Are you passing this

119
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:07,849
like around in class? Don't get me in trouble. Don't get yourself in trouble. You better turn

120
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:15,099
that over and there better be flash cards behind there. I don't want to get you in trouble.

121
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:24,490
Get me in trouble. Oh, there's a flash card all right. There's a flash all right.

122
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,130
Why would you say that? Pretty cool classroom. You can tell. Look at the thumb. There's like

123
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:37,500
the thumb on the corner right here. Just like with like a camera phone right here.

124
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,910
Right there, the second you took that photo, you probably just got yelled at.

125
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:51,990
It was like Steven. Yeah. What are you doing? No, no, just flash cards. Don't get me in trouble.

126
00:17:51,990 --> 00:18:09,910
I've been seeing this a lot lately. The lion from Madagascar. It does that thing.

127
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:20,140
I mean, I don't know. Did I steal it from Madagascar? I don't think I did. I've never

128
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:29,319
seen this movie though. I didn't see this movie. I've never seen Madagascar. Does he actually go

129
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:42,599
like this? Like bang. I don't think he does. Does he? I've never seen this movie. Maybe I like it

130
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:49,799
was all like in the background one day. No, I refuse to believe that I stole content from the

131
00:18:49,799 --> 00:19:00,599
lion Ben Stiller character in Madagascar. I refuse to think that. I refuse. No, like my like father

132
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,630
used to do this. Like this is my dad. He would be like, Oh, look at me. I don't, I don't do that.

133
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:15,819
I got to say, I got to see it. I got to see it. I think we've seen this already, but this is crazy.

134
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:26,200
This is from the Simpsons hit and run stream. It's terrifying. Like they're melting and

135
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:34,380
it's scary, but it's really, really well done. Yeah. This is a thumbnail for one of the videos.

136
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,029
Yeah. This is the second term of thumbnail. That's why I was like, I've seen this before.

137
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:53,160
It's crazy. It's good stuff. Yeah. Look at how this is as a, as a thumbnail.

138
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,160
You can still make up pretty much everything. That's how you know a thumbnail is good.

139
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,819
When it's this small and you can still tell everything that's going on. Excellent work.

140
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:18,789
Excellent work. Just like you. Hey Carnival. Carnival, uh, German. I love the fact that you

141
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,769
put a watermark on it because there's, there's, there's the million dollars in bits. Frog,

142
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:35,690
just a well-composed fun image. German lied about Wailord. You sure about that? Wait, where is he?

143
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:41,460
I don't know where he is. I think he was being cleaned. He's not here.

144
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,430
Whatever. I usually just sitting right here in this chair, but not right now. He lied.

145
00:20:52,069 --> 00:21:00,059
No, this is great. I like that. I like the teeth here. I like the crumpled up car run over hat.

146
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,430
Looks good. Very, very, very, very good job. Just all around. Good shit.

147
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:17,049
Here's Jax mix new bald coin marshmallows, low sugar. That's what I like to see.

148
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:30,390
I would eat this. What's the flavor though? Marshmallows, chocolate. This is like Cheerios.

149
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,130
Che, like kind of like Chex. I actually don't like, I think Chex are gross.

150
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,259
So I wouldn't want these to be Chex flavored because I find them to be absolutely abhorrent.

151
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:49,700
Don't, don't, don't give me that look. How, how, no, no, no, excuse me. You guys don't just leave

152
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,140
all the Chex in the Chex mix. Just remove the Chex from the Chex mix and you have like a really

153
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:04,359
great snack. I don't eat the Chex. I eat around the Chex, even the ones that are cheese flavored.

154
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:10,039
No, I don't, they're gross. They're just like too crunchy and they just taste like, like just

155
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:20,250
pure wheat. You eat the pretzels, you eat the fake Cheetos because heaven forbid we call them real

156
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,809
Cheetos and you eat the fake Cheez-It triangles and the rings and the rings and the little flat

157
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:33,750
bread pieces and the little weird gross white puff balls. I'll take those over Chex. Don't

158
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:49,960
eat any of the Chex. The rye, the rye bits. He's insane because I don't like Chex. He hates good

159
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,859
snacks. Like there's no way that this many people like Chex. I don't think that's real.

160
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:06,440
I think I'm getting like messed with here. Do you eat Chex in like milk too? Because like I'm about

161
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,799
to like, we're going to be going like a thousand miles per hour if that's true.

162
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:21,130
I'm not seeing a whole lot of no's. I cannot believe this. Chex are good as fuck. Chex are

163
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:31,049
amazing. This has to be a generational thing. Am I actually not in the majority when I say that I

164
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:39,299
don't like Chex? I can't believe this. No, like the old people eat Chex. You guys call everybody

165
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,089
boomers here. Old people eat the fuck out of those things. It's like their favorite snack.

166
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:53,750
They've been around for 150 years. You're the real boomer. Chex. Oh, even the word. I just think of

167
00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:06,329
it. This is called streamer. Is this like doom? Old people eat wheat thins. Yeah, you probably

168
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:19,430
eat those too. I'm the real zoomer. I eat like Bucky Charms, Gatorade, and Beyond Burgers.

169
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:38,140
That's all I eat. This is really good though. You eat plastic bottles? There's no, what do you mean

170
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,509
plastic? There's no plastic in Lucky Charms. Maybe a little bit of rat shit, but that's

171
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:57,980
FDA regulated. This is great. So this is, I'm like a doom character. What, is this in doom?

172
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:08,519
What's the globe? Rat shit is fine if it's regulated. Don't make me do the you eat over

173
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:18,900
an inch of dirt every meal thing again. I will. I'll do it and people will be very upset with me.

174
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:25,980
Here he goes. Just pretend I said it. You eat over an inch of dirt at every single meal you eat.

175
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,619
Every single meal you eat over an inch of dirt. I don't know how people don't understand that

176
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,779
when you're sitting at a dining room table. He did it. He did it. He actually did it.

177
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:52,730
This is awesome. Question marks don't get it. Think about it. That's, that's on you. Streamer.

178
00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:02,180
Very good image. I like the aesthetic. What is that image even of? I think it's from green screen.

179
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:14,500
Ooh, look! This werelord. How much of an inch of dirt is in grass? You eat food off of the grass.

180
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,900
So if you made a sandwich right now, you'd put it down on the grass before you ate it.

181
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:34,019
What are you talking about? I like the color back here. I'm asking, I'm talking to one person here.

182
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:40,980
One person said they eat like on the grass. I forget that there's like four, five thousand people

183
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:59,079
here. I'm talking to one person. What? Uh, werelord. I like the face here. This is really good. I think

184
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:12,819
that really captures me. Flat and then like, it's very good. I don't know how people draw.

185
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:19,529
You have to have a ton of patience to really actually sit there and do all this.

186
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:27,339
Cause I will get to the first stage, the first step of drawing and you start like blocking

187
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:33,180
out what you want and then it's all wrong. My legs are too big and it's like I have to,

188
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,859
I've made them like these big parachute legs and then you erase it but then I,

189
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:41,859
I screwed it all up so I don't even want to do it again. I have a lot of respect for people that

190
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:46,420
can do shit like this, that can draw and design. It's very, very, very, very, very cool.

191
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:55,190
Just draw for thousands of hours. Yeah, that's kind of how you do it. People are very, very

192
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:03,509
talented in their craft and everybody draws differently too. That's like the best part.

193
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:13,750
This is really cute. I'm liking it. Nice. This is kind of how like a dog will look at you.

194
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:20,650
And I mean if you like, or hey, like hey Otto and he's like, like huh? Like come over here.

195
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,750
This is a very like dog looking over at something that they're interested in.

196
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,930
The side eye. Yeah, the dog side eye. Let's get in a little closer.

197
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:44,950
God, rats are awesome. I wish I could just actually pull the trigger and actually get a rat,

198
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:52,339
two rats. I always get two. I just think I was gonna get a lizard before a rat. Can you guys

199
00:28:52,339 --> 00:29:04,309
believe that? I was gonna get a big ass lizard before I got a rat. It's tricky. Lizards are good

200
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:19,339
too. I know. No, not an iguana. What if I just got like a huge monitor lizard? They need a whole room

201
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:27,619
in your house by the way. They need, it's like having like a guest just there permanently,

202
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:33,220
like in a bedroom. They have to have their own room. Imagine having a fucking like lizard live

203
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:46,019
in your house. So it's like a kid, yeah. They are so cool though. They're not like main either.

204
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,410
Some of them can be, but there are some monitor lizards that are just, they don't give a shit

205
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,059
about anything. They're like, are you feeding me? I guess you and I are really good friends.

206
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:07,829
Get a lizard roommate. Maybe the lizard roommate will strain too. Give its own office.

207
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:18,460
That would be fucking crazy. Nah, too much. Too big. Maybe one day. Maybe one day.

208
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,829
But I do want a lizard though. I want like a bearded dragon. Just like a, like a, at least,

209
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:28,869
I want a bearded dragon that's at least as big as my head. As big as like by hand all the way down,

210
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,660
like all the way down my arm. But that's like, I don't know. Maybe, maybe like another time. I don't

211
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:58,569
know. Great photo though. Great pic. You guys nail eyes, can I just say? Like, I don't even know how

212
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:08,140
you do that. I do like that you have the fact that there's two in, two earbuds in. This is,

213
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,390
I know what shirt this is. This is the Aquaman shirt. I know what stream this is from.

214
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:28,230
Let's get in a little closer. See the real detail here. I like the shine here. Nice shine on the

215
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:37,500
hair because that's for real. See? You've got that little shine coloring coming in. That's not

216
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:50,410
turning white, is it? No, it's not. Is it white? No, it's just like a lighter blonde, right?

217
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:55,829
Uh oh. I look in the mirror every single day. It's just the width of the lights hit in my face,

218
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:20,170
I think. Cover the eyes and it looks like the TF2 soldier. It kind of does. It kind of does.

219
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:29,990
That's pretty cool. That's century. Get a haircut. You guys act like my hair is down to my ankles.

220
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,980
It's not that long. It's like not down to here. It's just like a normal hair.

221
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,019
No, I like it. It's staying. I'm gonna grow it on my face too. No, I would never do that.

222
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,730
This is, I remember this one. This is somebody did. This is from playing Jackbox, I think,

223
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:05,539
and this is what they were able to do in the drawing game. Dr. Swiss Cheese getting papers

224
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:12,339
from Dr. Rat. You have like a tiny little cube to work with in Jackbox. How do you even make a

225
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:21,349
fucking volcano? Don't you only have like 40 seconds to draw this stuff? It seems very hard

226
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:31,339
to do this. Dreamy live streamer. Caption Twitch streamer. What if you have a 43 inch tablet?

227
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:38,859
This is Drawception, not Jackbox. Right, okay. Blue Guy with Fedora. This is German Neptune.

228
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:47,579
Does that emote still exist? Did I delete that emote? I haven't seen that emote in a long time.

229
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:55,720
Oh, it's German Egg. Right, right, right. I feel like that's an emote I never see anymore.

230
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:06,500
We'll get rid of it. This is great though. Classy Egg. You can't remember his own lore?

231
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,300
I know my own lore, but that was, what do you mean I don't know my own lore? That is German Neptune,

232
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,789
but it was just so bad that I just uploaded it and called it an Egg. That is the lore. That's my own

233
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:27,590
lore. I know my own lore. I know my own channel. That's, that is German Neptune. Let's keep going.

234
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:38,170
This one scares me a little. This one freaks me out. It's Lil Germo, number one clown streamer.

235
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:47,059
It's just like, this is like, unsettles me. This is for Halloween, it seems, like the last few weeks.

236
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:54,199
Pretty relevant. Apparently I am a rat puppet, but it freaks me out because

237
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:02,230
this is typically what I wear when I stream. Except maybe like shorts, or the other way around.

238
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:11,320
This is like, it's too real for me, including a diaper. That's not a diaper. That's a pair of

239
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:22,460
underwear. That's not a diaper. I get like, yeah, I get huge hands. That's not a diaper. That is a

240
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:33,099
pair of underwear. Yeah, those are tighty whities. There's a difference. Not very much of a difference,

241
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:49,619
but there is. Tighty whities really are just thin diapers. I don't wear tighty whities. Nope, sorry,

242
00:35:49,619 --> 00:36:00,730
not on this guy. I don't wear tighty whities. Actually, there was one time where Kim and I,

243
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:08,230
I think we're on vacation somewhere. I think it was, she came to, whether it was E3 a couple years

244
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:14,309
ago, I don't remember what it was, but I ran out of underwear on the trip. And it was like,

245
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:18,630
I just have to get underwear. Let's just stop at like, a random store. I don't remember what the

246
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:26,710
store was, but I got a package of, I got a package of just tighty whity default underwear. And they

247
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:33,269
were huge, even though they were my size. And they just, they would like, cartoon tighty whity

248
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:39,300
underwear. And I remember just her laughing hysterically at me because I just had on this

249
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,139
tighty whities and I walked out of like, the hotel bathroom and like, brushing my teeth.

250
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,460
I just looked like a fucking idiot. And they were just like, bulky and all. They really probably

251
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:58,730
did look like a diaper. It wasn't the underwear she was laughing at. Oh, all right, I see what

252
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:14,760
you're doing here. Nice. You bastard. Ban that person for life. But yeah, I don't, I don't like

253
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,969
just tighty whity underwear. And they always show people in commercials wearing them. There's this

254
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:26,730
weird propaganda campaign with like shitty default, just tighty whity underwear, where they show these

255
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:34,519
like huge, handsome, like Chad guys wearing them. Nobody wears those. I don't, nobody buys those.

256
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:45,539
It's like, like tighty whity commercials are like the Switch commercials. Like they, it's the

257
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:50,820
equivalent of having like a big strong Chad guy in tighty whities in front of a camera is the same

258
00:37:50,820 --> 00:38:01,610
thing of having a party on the roof with like 30 people all hovered around one Switch. So I don't

259
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:10,420
know who's buying it. Not me. Not anymore. Not after that trip. Box of briefs are where it's at.

260
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:21,750
Absolutely. Yes. You only buy tighty whity underwear, in my opinion, in like an emergency

261
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:29,000
like that. That's like emergency ration underwear. Not for any other purpose. And it does what it's

262
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,110
supposed to do. My name is, this photo is very, very good, but it's very creepy. Like who are these

263
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:45,719
people up here? Are these supposed to be you guys? But you guys are in here. Why are you in my house?

264
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:56,739
It's creepy, but it's very well made. Nice job. I, this one, I didn't mean to put this one up.

265
00:38:56,739 --> 00:39:10,460
This is, I, I didn't, I, I, that must have stayed. This is me as the Joker. All right, when, okay,

266
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,219
when I go through all these images, like there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them,

267
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:18,460
right? Sometimes I save a bunch. I put like a bunch of tabs up and I go like, what do I want

268
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,219
to put that here? Maybe we'll put that over here. Uh, that's a good image. We'll put that. And then

269
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:25,659
I go, maybe this one too. Maybe. And like, I have like a bunch of that. I, they have kind of a rough,

270
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:32,440
like go through them all and like kind of condense them. I mean, it's, it's good. It's good,

271
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:40,730
but I'm not, it's, I'm not going to have this as an emote. No, you know why this is not,

272
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,969
I'm not going to have this as an emote because when this is small enough, it's just the Joker.

273
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:56,250
When this is at like 10%, that's just the Joker. That's not me. That's just Joaquin Phoenix.

274
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,650
It's still you. No, but that we're, that's not as small as it's, it's going to be. It's going to be

275
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:17,099
like 50% smaller than that. No, I'm not the Joker. I'm the Riddler. Get it right. Something,

276
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,300
something, something, something, Jim Carrey, something, something. It's because it was Jim

277
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:30,900
Carrey. I'm not going to do that face anymore. I already said I wasn't going to do it. I love

278
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:47,289
riding the frog. This is awesome. What is it? I like, I just like this. It's frog in the park too.

279
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:59,219
Tell us a riddle. Did you know Batman? Did you know that you eat over two inches of dirt

280
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:05,670
every single meal? What are you talking about, Riddler? Well, if you can't get it, then I'm

281
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:25,349
sorry, Batman. That's where you die. Good photo. How's that a riddle? That's a riddle.

282
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,579
It's a puzzle. It's a puzzle joke. It's a joke puzzle. That's a riddle. You have to think about

283
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:41,099
it. A joke is a riddle. A joke just is a riddle. That's a humorous riddle. That's why you have to,

284
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:50,250
what are you talking about? A joke is a humorous riddle. Oh, you, God, did you think you know

285
00:41:50,250 --> 00:42:06,309
comedy? You think you know comedy, Batman? It's a humorous riddle. Oh my God. I'm sorry, chat.

286
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:12,889
Yeah, I might as well get off camera and just play this. This is actually pretty good.

287
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:28,360
That wasn't a joke or a riddle. How is a joke not a riddle? You set up a punch line that the people

288
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:35,610
don't know what it is until you tell them. Three guys walk into a bar. One sits down and asks a

289
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:45,079
question. Like, it's just a long drawn out punch line. The punch line is the solution to the riddle.

290
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:56,539
You don't know the answer to that until you hear it. Come on. You know, it's a question that you

291
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:01,099
don't have the answer to until it's given to you by the fucking master puzzle creator of the joke.

292
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,559
So you are the joker, not the riddler. They live in the same house. They live in the same house.

293
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:34,309
Who cares? Oh, God. They all share, like, the same fucking flat. The best part about this one

294
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:45,019
is this is, uh, this is me kissing Kim that she took a picture of and they omitted it.

295
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:50,300
And it's just me. There's an image floating around of somebody, I don't know if we showed it before,

296
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,380
of me kissing myself with different clothes and different hair. And it's really, really fucking

297
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:18,300
weird. But Kim is supposed to be here. So this just looks really strange. This is called Mini,

298
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:35,400
Mini, no, that is it. That's Mini Man instead of Gemini Man. You motherfucker. Gemini Man. Oh,

299
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:43,940
you're embarrassing me now. What is this? Oh, is this it? Hold on. This, I need to put this on

300
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:53,449
camera. This is fucked up. Oh, this is so, this fucking weird, man. Hold on. Let me get this on

301
00:44:53,449 --> 00:45:25,480
camera. It's fucking so weird. It's just so, oh, it's because we're making the same face.

302
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:36,059
What an egomaniac. I didn't make, I didn't make this, I didn't make this riddle.

303
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:59,739
Let's move on. Disgusting. It's the same, like, and look, I know, I got criticized for that image.

304
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:09,099
Let me go back. I got criticized for this image because, yes, I look like a corpse. I look like

305
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:17,690
somebody in a casket. I understand that. But the photo was taken. The photo was taken right when,

306
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:23,769
like, we first started kissing and it was just like, oh, it started there. I mean, like, I look

307
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:36,380
like, I look like I'm just asleep. I look like I'm sleeping. Another one. I'm not clicking it. This

308
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,940
is community, that is community content. You're right. This is community content. That's correct.

309
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:50,309
Click it. Hold on. We can't just get stuck. We got, like, another three hours of footage.

310
00:46:50,309 --> 00:47:14,679
We haven't even got to the video section. All right. Whatever. All right. That's it. That's it.

311
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:41,289
That's it. Okay. That was good. Let's move on. This is, I like, this is almost like clay. Like,

312
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:49,619
I've made it, like, it's been molded out of clay. I need Dead Rising today. I already beat it.

313
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,420
I'd be Dead Rising all the way through. We're going to start Dead Rising 2.

314
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:18,440
Don't say tomorrow. Hold on. No, no. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.

315
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:30,090
Maybe. No. In, like, a few, no. Next week. I'm going to do something else. We just did Dead

316
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:36,900
Rising. I just streamed it, like, the whole thing. No. Not tomorrow. Not the next day.

317
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,940
Maybe another time. Next week. You'll see. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I got to talk,

318
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:50,010
we got to announce this because, like, what the heck? I, over the next couple days,

319
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,570
there's going to be a new channel that gets opened up in the Discord.

320
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:06,039
What do you think it's going to be? It is going to be green screen DLC for free discussion.

321
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,039
Over the next, like, probably few, probably, like, in a couple days. It'll be up there.

322
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:16,519
And then that stream, green screen DLC for free, will be probably in, like, two or three weeks.

323
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,059
And then for the next community content night, we're going to see, we're going to see what you

324
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:32,820
come up with. But that'll be probably in, like, two or three weeks from now. But this is great.

325
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:40,019
I like the background of this one. This, was this brush? Like, take a look down here. You know what

326
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:53,110
I mean? This is brush stroke, right? Looks like it. I like when, like, the canvas shows up in the

327
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:58,630
background. You can see. Because then it adds, like, you got the white and then you got, like,

328
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,929
the maroon and then you got, like, the face. It's really, really good. Excellent work.

329
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:26,099
Here's the, look at those yellow teeth. There's the egg. This is unbelievable. Yolk teeth.

330
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:38,219
Nice work. You captured his essence very well. He, this is kind of how he is all day. And there's

331
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:43,000
blood in his mouth. Yeah, because look at how sharp his teeth are. We went over this already.

332
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:55,989
Now what are you guys linking? Uh, nice job. We haven't seen very much egg. He's been in two

333
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:04,780
videos ever. So, then why would we ever see him again? Click the link. Hold on. I'm in the middle

334
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:21,269
of something. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not real, right? That's not real, is it? No, that's

335
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:42,570
not real. Is that real? That's not good. What the fuck? God damn it. You gotta be fucking kidding

336
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:51,719
me. How long does those stay there for? How long does it stay up like that? Oh my god damn it.

337
00:51:51,719 --> 00:52:09,079
Okay. Well, excellent work on the egg. It's gone now. Imagine seeing that shit. There's, uh,

338
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:17,289
Jerma Myers. How, so we're going to get a lot of Halloween themed ones because Halloween was,

339
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:27,179
like, two weeks ago. So, it's still there. That thumbnail is so bad because it's,

340
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:34,519
it's a just chatting and it's somebody with their webcam in the corner, which is obviously

341
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:42,019
the person that's in the photo reacting to them, like, hooking up with themself. That's not,

342
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:50,280
that's fucking bad. I, you scroll right by that and you don't even click, you go, no, no, no.

343
00:52:50,280 --> 00:53:01,960
God damn it. Uh, this is good. I like how it's the, it's the mask is what it is. Like, that's

344
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:15,590
not even what I look like under there. Nice touch. Jerma actually looks like unmasked Mike

345
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:24,500
Myers. I don't. Wait, I don't even, what does unmasked Mike Myers look like? I mean, true.

346
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,940
There's been like 30 Halloween movies. I don't know which one. I've only seen like 10 minutes

347
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:49,739
of two of them. This is really good though. This image will haunt me forever. This is like, okay,

348
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:56,150
you know those cursed videos that you can watch and it's like, don't watch this video. You'll get

349
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,829
cursed if you watch it for more than 10 seconds. There've been, there've been reports of people

350
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:07,320
who have, have watched this video and then they died. Like that's what this is. Don't watch,

351
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:16,489
don't look at this for more than 10 seconds. Actually, it's like, this is like actually scary.

352
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:31,420
I feel like it's moving. Look at it for a while. No, no, no, no, no, no. Next one. Next one.

353
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:39,510
Cause I don't want it to be on the thumbnail for the live thumbnail. That's a huge clear image of

354
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,469
like a gross face I've made, but let's go back and look at it one more time. So it's not the

355
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:51,579
thumbnail. Okay. I always thought that hair was probably the hardest thing to do. All you artists

356
00:54:51,579 --> 00:55:04,710
out there and nice job. Love the watermark. Hair seems impossible. Every strand. Do you have to do

357
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:16,519
every strand? I have a crooked, somebody said crooked nose. Yeah. What about it? I have a crooked

358
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:23,590
nose. I got hit, I got hit in the face when I, when I was like fucking 12 on a trampoline.

359
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,469
I jumped on a trampoline and I landed on my back and my knees, I landed with my knees up and my

360
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:34,380
knees came back and hit me right in the fucking face. And it like for life. And then I got hit

361
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:44,760
with a baseball, like right here. And then I got hit with a recycling bin right here. And then I

362
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:51,610
fell down some stairs and like bumped it hard. How did you get hit in the face with a recycling bin?

363
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,800
Taking out the recycling and I was flipping it around. I was like doing like flips with it

364
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:13,510
because I was fucking 13 and stupid. It's a garbage truck accident. Like trying to like a

365
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,630
water. Okay. Remember the water, you remember the water bottle thing where it's like, I'm going to

366
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:21,429
try to flip it. So it like lands on it's like this, right? Imagine you doing that with something

367
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:25,750
that's 20 times as big and like throwing it up in the air and trying to catch it in your mouth,

368
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:41,590
like a popcorn kernel. When you, when you're a kid, things seem like they're fun and interesting.

369
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:46,389
They're dangerous. Don't do those things. Oh, it's going to be the thumbnail. It's going to be the

370
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:54,650
thumbnail. Not anymore. Says the guy that's probably done enough stupid shit, even the last like two

371
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:04,940
years on this stream. You can't ignore this forever. Oh, I can and I will. I can and I will. No,

372
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:18,659
it's not. Is it the thumbnail? It's not the thumbnail. Stop it. I have to, I'm in the middle

373
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:24,179
of something. All right. I got to, I got to go. I thought that was auto. That's not even fucking

374
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:46,380
real. What? This is fake. This is a fake image. This didn't just happen. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye.

375
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:58,550
Lost stakes. Wait, what, what category is this supposed to be in? Why are there like stakes and

376
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:11,590
like stews? Chill your mind in the dishwasher. What the fuck is this stream? And is it still

377
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:20,730
live? Because if it is, I hope it's, I hope it is. Chill your mind in the dishwasher. What a great

378
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:38,619
stream. Oh my God. That's funny. All right. See, if they're still live, give them a follow. Barbecue,

379
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:48,730
smoked brisket and lamb. Holy shit. These channels seem fucking cool. I should watch all these.

380
00:58:50,739 --> 00:59:00,619
All right. Let's go. This is a compilation of work from Gen 2. We can't see them because I'm in the

381
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:04,219
way. So let me get out of the way for a second. So you see the watermark. Good watermark. Excellent

382
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:17,460
watermark. The thumbnail is the face. Whatever. So here is just a compilation of things they did.

383
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:23,429
I like the rat. Let's get in close so you can see these. So we can see them all. There's a really

384
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:39,380
nice render of bald coin. I like that one. Here is, does that mean like vaping? The pumpkin. What is

385
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:45,079
that? Is it like a tray? Like a dinner tray or something? Like a plast, like a keychain. It looks

386
00:59:45,079 --> 01:00:00,500
awesome. Chill your mind. Yeah. I mean, I would rather have, you guys know this already. I would

387
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,780
rather have a coffee and fried chicken with like, I really would rather eat this meal. This meal is

388
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:15,849
way better than this. Steak and, no, this is a better meal for me. Save the line. I can't, otherwise

389
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:25,719
we won't get over it. There's coffee here. There's fried chicken here. And there's also a puffy

390
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:38,489
snack. That's Cheetos. Coffee. No, no, we've moved on. We've moved on.

391
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:50,730
Hold on. Okay. They're gone. This is cool though. I want to do this. Let's see if I can find one.

392
01:00:52,039 --> 01:01:02,780
Compact word search. There's coffee right there. There's coffee. There's Cheetos. There's coffee.

393
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:18,519
Cheetos. And there's coffee, Cheetos, and chicken. There it is. Got it. Okay, I want to find a

394
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:30,099
Germacraft right there. Got it. How about, uh, pee pants? Pee? No. Pee. Can you go diagonal?

395
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:44,739
Pee pants. There it is. Nice. Got it. He's going all out. No, just a no. There's a nice, uh, rat

396
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:59,800
painting. Click here for your free iPod Touch 5. The fake ad on this page. What the fuck? These

397
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:10,230
are great though. I like the compilation. Click it. It doesn't do anything. Okay, it doesn't work.

398
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:31,769
It's an image, guys. It's not a website. I'm clicking. Do you not hear? See? That's fake.

399
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:41,940
What? Let's keep going. This mouse sucks though. Don't ever buy this. Like, I'm going to give you

400
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:52,059
like, anti. Don't, um, just don't buy this ever. Let's keep going. Oh, Jojo's Bazaar Adventure.

401
01:02:52,059 --> 01:03:00,489
Germa 5 foot 8. Featuring the Haunt Single QRS. Rat Records 5.98. This is a nice touch.

402
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:06,280
This is hard to emulate. What you have to do here is you have to actually get a photo of this with

403
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:11,159
that price on it, because that font doesn't exist. And you have to doctor it up. And then you got to

404
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:21,099
make it a little dirty. This is some work. It's just a pose. No, I'm talking about the price up

405
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:27,179
here. That's hard to emulate that. That's like the exact font. I'm sorry. When I, when I go to like,

406
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:35,880
font, fontditty.org, whatever the hell it's called, they don't have grocery store price tag font.

407
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:51,130
That took work. fontditty.com. Featuring the Haunt Single QRS. This is great. I like the,

408
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:57,780
how it's a little washed out here at the bottom. Excellent job. And you've got a, you've got a

409
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:11,559
watermark. Nice job, Cold. Good stuff. Very well edited. Demonwood Zaraxos at the Germa Rumble.

410
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:21,820
One night only. New Year's Zoo 2014. Doors open at 5 p.m. This is great. It's like those bar photos,

411
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:36,329
bar posters for random events. One night only. This is like the great photo. This is what great

412
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:53,139
on a wall. Make this a poster. Make this a poster. Make it a shirt. Make it a poster. This is so good.

413
01:04:54,230 --> 01:05:00,119
Make it both. Make it a coffee mug. Man, there's too many things. Make more merch. Merchandise,

414
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:08,710
merchandise, merchandise, merchandise. I would consider purchasing this. I would, holy shit,

415
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:17,900
this is like unanimously, oh my god, you guys want to buy this. Merchandise, all right, well,

416
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:26,059
all right, hold on, wait, hold on. Just wait, let's, well, just hold on to that. Make this an emote.

417
01:05:27,099 --> 01:05:39,909
This doesn't work as an emote. Pay the art. No, if I was going to do this for like a poster,

418
01:05:40,469 --> 01:06:04,780
they would get a majority of the money. 51%. That's still a majority. 50 point, 50.1%.

419
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:19,590
It's technically still a majority. No, I'm fucking kidding. Or is he? Pay them an exposure.

420
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:35,849
We'll figure this out because there's also, there's also like, people have made stuff in this

421
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:43,210
community, like fireman, like this type of stuff. I would want to do that right. You know what I

422
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:49,369
mean? I really don't want to just be like, oh, thanks for the image. Yoink, and now it's a poster.

423
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:54,940
Thanks for the money. Actually, we've talked about it once or twice about doing another shirt,

424
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:02,679
doing like community shirts. But I would, I would want to make sure that it was like fair. I would

425
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:07,480
want the person that actually made it to be happy with it and happy with what they got. But that's

426
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,190
a process though. That's not just as simple as one, two, three. I would want that to be them

427
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:26,150
then to be happy. Regulations. Just make this a hoodie. But that, but there's another thing too

428
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:30,710
here is, I mean, let's get real. Ready? Let's get real. No more riddles. Okay. Like forget about the

429
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:43,110
riddles. When you take stuff from the community, for instance, like this, you end up, it's like,

430
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:46,789
there's been hundreds of images that have come through that people were like, oh, well, that was

431
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:52,309
awesome. That was really great. But one of them is the shirt. It's like, well, mine, what was wrong

432
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:54,630
with mine? What was wrong with that one? What was wrong with that? We should have that one and that

433
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:59,349
one. You have to, I just, you have to be careful just because I never want to have anybody think

434
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:03,909
like, oh, well, this one was the shirt. Cause it was the fucking best. Yours wasn't any good.

435
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:15,050
It can get a little weird sometimes. No one cares about that. I know, but still it would have to be

436
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:22,119
something that we unanimously thought was a good idea. Cause I wouldn't, I don't want anybody to

437
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:28,279
think that like their images or their art as great or incredible as it was, is in like a competition

438
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,970
for a t-shirt or for a poster or something. You know what I'm saying? It would just be as simple

439
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:40,229
as this is, it just happened this way. I don't want this to ever be a competition of who makes

440
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:47,260
the best art. That's not the point. And if something like this, if that ever ended up happening

441
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:51,899
for some reason, it's not because this is the best image that ever was put through,

442
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:59,100
it's because it just happened that way. You know what I'm saying? No, you know what I'm saying?

443
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:06,460
You know what I'm saying? He did it. Slot fucking slime on me. He did it. Um, we'll see though.

444
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:10,380
I'm open to it, but I would want it to be done right. I'd want it to be fair to whoever was

445
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,899
given the image and I would want it to be the right thing that we all thought was a good idea.

446
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:21,979
Okay. All right. Back to the riddles. I don't know if this is supposed to be in this.

447
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:28,739
What am I getting, like a windows update? Am I actually getting a win? Don't you fucking dare.

448
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:39,739
I saw the ring. Merch. Get this on a poster. Get this on a pizza box. Make this a shirt.

449
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:50,659
How does somebody already have that ready to go? No, not everything is merch.

450
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:59,619
There's a good potential fun emote though. I need emotes too. Derma, but it's me. Germ yourself.

451
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,319
This is supposed to be like a fake, like Snapchat filter.

452
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:22,260
What is this? So this is a fake Snapchat filter thing. It's me at the DMV? I included it. I've

453
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:29,909
been looking at a lot of images. Derma, but it's me. Germ yourself. This is like a take on the

454
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:44,119
Snapchat. Look at me. Today, the change of faces. It's like Brad Pitt today, right? Why the DMV

455
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:50,550
though? I don't understand that. Here's Twitch chat versus Germa 95. Rob versus me brawler.

456
01:10:51,369 --> 01:11:00,279
On day four, carnival. Insert text here. This is cute. This is cute and has a lot of layers.

457
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:16,869
Nice job. That's cute. This is you guys. And it even has, look at this. So it's Rob,

458
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:21,430
but look at that little piece of paper. That's the smile that just was tacked on there to be you.

459
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:39,060
I love it. Excellent job. Everyone's going to say emote, but when it's shrunk down,

460
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:44,090
it just looks like a car with hair. I don't even know what this looks like.

461
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:55,319
It's better like this. It's much better like this. This is not emote. This is desktop background.

462
01:11:55,319 --> 01:12:08,760
It's perfect. Make it a B-T-T-V emote. You know what's going to be interesting? Can you imagine

463
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:14,760
if eventually Twitch and streaming and stuff is so normal that they start teaching these things in

464
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:20,899
class like at college? It's like how to connect your B-T-T-V and enable emotes. There's going to

465
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:26,340
be like Twitch stream college classes and they're going to look, I'm going to be in a book somewhere.

466
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:45,939
You're going to be fanning through like a hundred years. There he is. Ego maniac. What? I was the

467
01:12:45,939 --> 01:13:02,439
first person to ever sing on stream. That happened in like 2011. I was the first person. I was the

468
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:07,510
first person to get in a rowboat and row down a river on stream. Remember we went over the

469
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:13,109
waterfall and I was like holy shit that's like 400 feet drop and I like I went down it was like

470
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,310
it was like holy fuck the camera panned back and it showed me going all the way down the waterfall

471
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:22,550
and then like I bursted out of the water like a shampoo commercial and it was like

472
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:32,939
and it was like pogchamp. Everyone freaked the fuck out. I was the first person to do that.

473
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:52,060
I'll be in that book. Oh look at this. They're in the same family. Shito. They're so cute.

474
01:13:53,060 --> 01:14:01,130
I just want a video game with what's it called? What are those actual? They have an insanely long

475
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:09,819
name. The face flute. What is it actually called? I want a face flute video game where you walk

476
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:22,220
around and like make noise and stuff. Automaton. An automaton. Right. The face flute. Don't you

477
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:29,060
just want that to be like an item in a game? It's in Kirby? No not that one. Don't stop.

478
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:51,380
Holy shit. What the fuck? Watch this. I look like a different person. Watch watch me chameleon into

479
01:14:51,380 --> 01:15:14,779
a different person. Holy shit that was kind of weird. He really does do it. He actually fucking

480
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:30,489
does this. What the fuck. Look at me. I need to like look up a clip of if this is real.

481
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:41,899
I need to see. God damn it. I hate seeing this in reality. Give me a link. I want to see it.

482
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:58,279
Give me a link. I want to see this once and for all. The lion roar. Fuck. It is the same thing

483
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:11,189
that I do. God damn it. But it's not though. Fuck. It really is the same thing. Hold on. I need to

484
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:33,479
get this on camera. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee. I'll see

485
01:16:33,479 --> 01:21:11,100
you guys in like fucking a minute. Hello. Sorry it took a little while. He's chilling his mind

486
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:31,619
in the dishwasher. You scared me. Get jump scared. It's still going? The dishwasher is

487
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:44,390
actually still going? Wow. All right where were we? Oh right. That's right. We were in the middle

488
01:21:44,390 --> 01:22:02,619
of doing this. It's even like the right elbow placement. Like god damn it. Whatever. It is what

489
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:11,130
it is. I was just like in my room. Just had my pillow in my face. Just going like. It's a cool

490
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:31,079
pose. It's a really cool pose. Why can I not go forward? You know it took me like I it was like

491
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:37,850
a double take to see if like this is like a real photo of me. Like when was it? Oh no no no no no.

492
01:22:40,220 --> 01:23:03,289
Very clearly it's not. You're too tall. Djerba. There it is. Of course we got Yen Wen with an

493
01:23:03,289 --> 01:23:10,869
insanely. This is the type of shit I'm talking about when I say art. I don't understand. How do you,

494
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:20,970
how do you even make that happen? This is when I was showing you guys how I shave.

495
01:23:21,609 --> 01:23:27,050
But seriously it's it's like it's like it's really happening on the screen.

496
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:37,260
The pressure at the the trajectory of the fingers going into the cheek. The wrinkling.

497
01:23:37,899 --> 01:23:50,020
This is some like renaissance style. Like the like old school like paintings of people. It's

498
01:23:50,020 --> 01:24:02,010
unbelievable. Uh Alamanda just gave five community subs. Thank you. It looks like there's uh some

499
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:13,590
line work going on down here. This is like Michelangelo type shit. The hands. You can see

500
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:26,460
you can see the skin folding. That's like that's what my hand looks like. Yen Wen again just

501
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:33,460
unbelievable work. Egomaniac. Me talking about my my my skin folds on my fingers.

502
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:49,500
It's kind of gross actually. Egomania at its finest. Oh link and chat. Link and chat. Link

503
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:56,500
and chat. Link and chat. Link and chat. Not right now. But awesome yet again. Yeah Yen Wen.

504
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:09,430
Awesome yet again. Well written original structured joke. No emotion for two minutes.

505
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:30,020
Oh shit. Um but there was a reason why oh shit was so funny. It wasn't just somebody said oh shit.

506
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:36,250
It was every single character had a different way that they said it and they all said it.

507
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:50,220
That's more that's well structured original riddles. I'll take a loss on this one okay.

508
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:53,659
I'll take a loss on that one. Not on the first one. Absolutely. I'll take a loss on this one.

509
01:25:54,300 --> 01:26:13,770
Whatever. I did cry laughing at that. But there was but that um but hold on. It was the it was

510
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:19,130
the the first part with the gym and the loud song and like the if that was what that person was

511
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:25,529
listening to as like a remix. That's what was funny to me. It wasn't the human biology of going

512
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:38,409
to the bathroom. No it was not just that. Shito man incoming. Look at this Otama dude. Look at

513
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:47,579
this Otama dude. This is so cute. You've combined you've evolved Shito into a new character.

514
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:59,739
Or is it just Shito with hair? With with beautiful hair might I add. The fusion to Anne is singing.

515
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:08,699
And I like the this. Look at this. This is good. This is like just odd sounds coming out. Just like

516
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:26,090
just broken. Oh it's a shirt. Oh it's a mug. Oh it's a car keychain. It's very very good though.

517
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:33,989
By Groove Wizard. Nice watermark. Put watermarks on your stuff please. So people know who it was.

518
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:40,229
Watermark it. Uh excellent excellent job. A Shito Otama dude.

519
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:59,270
That's crazy. Oh no fire man got gobbled up. That's not good. What's what's with all the blood?

520
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:13,739
That's blood. Is it? Or is it ketchup? Oh that's the dork cube. Okay right right right you're right.

521
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:23,159
It is it is blood. It just was in a box and shipped to you. Very good. I like the corner.

522
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:29,560
Just like oh this is bad. This is bad. Just say it's ketchup. Yeah that's what I just did.

523
01:28:32,069 --> 01:28:40,789
Good stuff. I think there's another one. There is. I don't even know where half these photos are

524
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:53,829
from. Oh there's Otto. There's you. See if I can recognize all these. McChicken. Turbo Raptor.

525
01:28:53,829 --> 01:29:05,539
I'm not sure what that is. I think that's just in the game. There's a rat. Turbo Venus. Of course

526
01:29:05,539 --> 01:29:16,569
we've got the uh the poses. Beanbag Sonic. All rolled up by me who's crying. I'm apparently not

527
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:27,000
happy about doing all this. This is good and fire man's is still good to go. Not even rolled up.

528
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:36,680
A lot of sad faces in here. And no what about Otto? Got the worst emote on Twitch. It's currently

529
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:41,859
rolled up. That's good. There's somebody's doodle of umjammer Lammy from that stream.

530
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:48,329
Pretty good. I like the fact that it's just a folded next part of your scrapbook there.

531
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:57,369
I need to make a face like this because that's like a really good image to have for a planet.

532
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:10,409
Pretty good uh pretty good Lammy. Floating in outer space. Lammy emote. Oh emote? Yeah let's

533
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:14,420
make this an emote. When it gets that small you can just see. It's just a piece of paper at that

534
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:25,260
point. It should be German notebook. Good shit. Uh this is the quote that uh a senior yearbook

535
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:32,500
quote. Uh I was taken out of context for this one but we'll read it anyways. This is uh keep

536
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,899
your eyes on the prize. The road to success is always under construction. Pretty fucking goddamn

537
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:43,220
good if you ask me. Boring boring boring boring boring boring. That's what my mother used to say

538
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:48,340
to me. That's a that's a quote from my mother. You what are you why are you going to make fun

539
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:53,880
of my mother? Are you making fun of my mother? Mrs. Albertson huh? I didn't say end quote.

540
01:30:57,029 --> 01:31:04,630
That'd be a really really strange quote. I don't think that would be I don't I think there's like

541
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:12,710
a Twitter amount of characters you can have in your senior quote. It's like under 150 characters.

542
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:23,319
I don't think this one would fly. And then here we go. Uh remember the last time we had somebody

543
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:30,020
give an interesting Imgur gallery of their created characters from Soul Calibur. They have some more.

544
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:37,739
So this first one is uh grandpa. Grandpa entered the ring with a kendo stick. His doctor said

545
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:42,060
to not participate due to heart problems but fuck that. Watch out for this crazy old bastard.

546
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:51,300
Pretty good. There's uh the ring master. Straight from the carnival comes the victim

547
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,699
of chat abuse himself. He had to change from his glue man shirt to his night sky shirt after a

548
01:31:55,699 --> 01:32:05,529
dunk tank issue. He's weak against wind type and frog type. That wind was nuts. I'm surprised that

549
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:12,220
half of this stuff is even in the game. Do you can you bring in custom images into Soul Calibur 6?

550
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:27,619
You can? No. So how did you do the planets here? They're very clearly there's planets right there.

551
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:38,199
Or is it like a sun? Is that just really really good replacement of something? It was kind of

552
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:45,800
hard but they're all suns. Oh all right. That's still really cool though. This demon grandpa

553
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:53,140
from Jerma Rumble Live and he's the scythe. That's awesome. Oh there's a Louie Anderson.

554
01:32:53,699 --> 01:33:17,779
Is it just a nightmare? There's Jex. Can you tell I like that shirt? That's pretty close too.

555
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:32,359
Jerma Louie. Holy shit he's here. He's here right now. There's the egg. Everybody loves the egg.

556
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:37,720
The egg the egg has okay you know when a character steals the show but they were

557
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:44,020
a cameo and they were on screen for like only like three minutes. It's like the egg has like a

558
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:55,350
collective like 0.0002 percent screen time but people just love him. He's great. This is good.

559
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:09,560
Jerma Craft. That's so that's so works perfectly. It's perfect.

560
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:20,010
Here comes the coffee pasta of course. I wouldn't have it any other way.

561
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:31,000
And then here is HHH the headless the horseless headless horseman from TF2.

562
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:44,760
There's a Tertemus. You even got the like the cage right. Do I I really should probably play

563
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:51,659
this game for like an hour just to play it. There's a 30s milkman. There's Star. He ain't

564
01:34:51,659 --> 01:35:04,199
that jacked. He's not that jacked. Look at that arm. He shrank that a little like 30 percent.

565
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:15,960
Unrealistic. Demon Lord Xeroxos with the you got the sweater. Oh my god.

566
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:28,970
The apple. It's just a turtle shell but it works. See the mind of a creator of a character creator.

567
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:34,100
You got it. You make those sacrifices. You make those compromises to figure out how to get the

568
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:44,300
character to work on camera. Good fucking work. Seriously this is like yep you get it. Oh you get

569
01:35:44,300 --> 01:36:09,140
it. Pinwheel. Papyrus. Jesus. There we go. Fireman. You can paint too. Captain Crunch.

570
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:17,340
Giant rat. It's just got this nose. There's like what is it like there's a there's a monitor lizard

571
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:30,260
character in Soul Calibur. That's that's what I want. This is what I want in my house. That's

572
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:36,039
awesome. This Sonic the Hedgehog and you fight with a ring. Of course you do.

573
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:49,420
Super Jex. Super Jex is just barely bigger and stronger than Star. These are all so good and

574
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:54,300
then of course I don't think you can watermark Soul Calibur characters but these were made by

575
01:36:54,300 --> 01:37:05,220
gnarly 62. Good shit. These were fantastic. That's my favorite. Just shows what you have

576
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:13,670
just shows what you're willing to be able to do to get what you want on screen. The apple.

577
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:21,260
All right let's keep going. WWE superstar Roman Reigns reviews wrestling scenes in movies. Vanity

578
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:34,649
Fair. Oh there's context to this one. This is I think my bitrate dropped to like 500 one day

579
01:37:36,619 --> 01:37:42,229
and then somebody posted this image and everybody thought it was real.

580
01:37:53,619 --> 01:38:04,920
It was. I mean it was. This is not a real image. This one's real yeah because I remember looking

581
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:14,539
over at chat and everyone was like your bitrate is fucked but this one is a edit. Get this on a

582
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:28,470
mug. Good stuff. Oh here's the official from apple shift. This is I think we looked at this the other

583
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:36,859
day but we'll look at it again. This is from 2k20 I think. Pretty accurate. Let's get let's get let

584
01:38:36,859 --> 01:38:52,260
me set up a little bit here. Good stuff. That beautiful hair too. It's almost as good as mine.

585
01:38:53,220 --> 01:39:00,539
Mine's okay. That's the full tire. Mine's like the flat tire but it's the same. It's the same tire.

586
01:39:00,539 --> 01:39:15,420
That one has a little more air in it. What is this? This is this is a sandwich. Is this a picture of

587
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:36,949
a snake? I think it's supposed to be me. Is that my eyes? I think that's me. You don't remember the

588
01:39:36,949 --> 01:39:47,159
snake. No not new. We already have this as an emote. This is somebody made the emote in real life.

589
01:39:47,239 --> 01:40:06,920
This is Bogdanoff, Germany. Good shit. Me as the joker again. And it's that same image. I can see it

590
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:12,470
from a mile away. You can always tell because of the eye. One eye goes right completely forward.

591
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:17,750
The other guy the other one guy goes this way. One guy okay. One eye is normal. The other eye is

592
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:25,029
buried into the socket and going this way. I can always tell when it's in that image.

593
01:40:25,989 --> 01:40:32,840
You know which one I'm talking about. Oh and like the whole face too. It's pretty good though.

594
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:47,829
Nice stuff. I I've had this movie spoiled for me. What? That's not good. And Shito. Very good

595
01:40:47,829 --> 01:40:59,909
Shito. Very clean. A very clean Shito. The happy face with the little sheen on the top. It's

596
01:40:59,909 --> 01:41:16,020
beautiful. It is beautiful. It's got good lighting. Yeah it does. Good shading. Give me a watermark.

597
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:22,949
Give me a watermark down here. Gotta give me that watermark. Otherwise like otherwise like who made

598
01:41:22,949 --> 01:41:29,800
this? Could be anybody. Give me that watermark. Up here. Down here. Right here. Just right there.

599
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:47,399
Small. And I'm gonna zoom in. You'll see it. It's fucking fantastic. It's fantastic. I love it. I

600
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:59,500
love this one too. This is with pencil. Pencil smudges and shit doesn't it? Do you use cloth

601
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:07,159
when you do this? I can imagine. Okay hear me out on this. When you are drawing something,

602
01:42:07,159 --> 01:42:13,560
doesn't matter what it is. If you have pencil, pen. When I okay let's say I draw a circle or

603
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,159
even if I'm writing like a check or something. You write out whatever it is you're writing

604
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:22,199
and then there has to be more done to what you're doing and you put like your hand and arm on the

605
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:27,880
paper and you like lift up and like your sweat from your arm has ruined the picture and like

606
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:34,409
smudged it and smeared the ink and smeared the the graphite and how do you how do you do stuff

607
01:42:34,409 --> 01:42:44,010
this detailed without like resting your like whole fucking body on the table? It must be so difficult

608
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:48,420
to do that because think about it. If you if let's say you you were working right here right?

609
01:42:50,119 --> 01:42:55,479
You have this whole area down here that could be smudged by your hand and wrist and arm.

610
01:42:56,119 --> 01:43:00,010
You put paper under your hand. Do you really just like put like a towel or like a paper or

611
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:05,859
something on underneath? You paper on top of the drawing and then you kind of slide it down while

612
01:43:05,859 --> 01:43:16,569
you work. That's cool. They wear a hazmat suit. That's cool. You're drawing. Why are you sweating?

613
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:25,289
I've run hot. I'm one of those people and you're gonna know what I mean when I talk about this.

614
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:32,729
You know when you are in the car like let's say you pick up somebody or you're you know it has

615
01:43:32,729 --> 01:43:38,170
to be fairly cold for this to work too. So I'm the person that gets in the car during like a

616
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:45,770
40-50 degree day and after about five minutes the windows start to fog because I'm in the car.

617
01:43:46,409 --> 01:44:00,390
It happens every fucking time. That happens to me. Good right and I know it's me but I don't you

618
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:05,909
don't say anything. What if I go oh sorry guys I uh I have like the internal temperature of

619
01:44:05,909 --> 01:44:13,029
fucking thanksgiving turkey. Sorry. I just see the corners start to fog up because I got in the car

620
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:19,859
and then I just sit there and I go oh whatever I'm just I'm just in your car

621
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:24,439
and they know because there's two other people here. There's two other people in the back seat

622
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:29,350
and this the car was not fogged up. I got in close the door. Windows are up. Let's go.

623
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:36,380
Here we go. We're going down the road. Fog. Well that's weird. This didn't happen for any other

624
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,560
reason. Just open a window. Yeah that and you crack no but if you if you crack the window

625
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:48,310
if I go just so it goes down like a half an inch and let out all like the fucking human steam

626
01:44:49,189 --> 01:44:55,479
everybody knows that it's I did that. Why do you think I fucking why I think I'm always naked?

627
01:44:56,119 --> 01:45:02,060
Well that's a little weird that you never have clothes on when you're streaming. Yeah because

628
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:11,289
like I'm I weigh like a thousand degrees and that's right I said weigh because it's heavy.

629
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:20,810
Anyways if I were to draw this I would lift up and this would look all nice and this would be

630
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:30,920
as if it was like a three-year-old with watercolors just smearing their hand all over the paper. I'm

631
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:46,140
just I run hot. He's melting. What did you do in your art minor? I don't know. I got like a bunch

632
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:57,739
of clay and hit a baseball bat 20 times and then like I gave it eyes and a mouth and it was just

633
01:45:57,739 --> 01:46:07,720
like another face. Great. I just saw that happen in real time. I forget that people can just press

634
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:18,439
the button. I always forget that that like yeah this is live. Remember I grew up with like TiVo

635
01:46:18,439 --> 01:46:24,739
was like a thing that just came out. I was like 18. I was like probably 20 when TiVo was like a

636
01:46:24,739 --> 01:46:38,119
thing that at first came out. Click on the link. Never. I'll never click on the link. Look at how

637
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:53,979
awesome this is. This is somebody made a plush toy of that dude fireman. Merch, merch, sell it,

638
01:46:53,979 --> 01:46:59,819
sell it, sell it, sell it. Now you can't just sell everything. I can't just I can't just sell

639
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:08,970
everything guys. Like you can't. No no I don't I don't like no no no I'm not I'm not going

640
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:31,079
corporate. Had to reply. I'm not going corporate. You're the greedy grinner. All right fine. We're

641
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:46,020
going corporate. This is fantastic though seriously. It's just love went into this you can tell. Very

642
01:47:46,020 --> 01:48:01,689
very good job and we are all currently looking at him. Something's gonna be bopping real soon

643
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:10,199
and like I'm weirdly drinking that because like I know you're watching me.

644
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:15,640
It's the same thing like a being on the date. Like you I I know you're watching me drink this so I'm

645
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:33,029
like get this on BTTV. This is not mine. I didn't make this and none of you made this either.

646
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:54,979
Just yoink it. Anybody yoink this? No this ain't mine. I didn't make this. Yeah nobody did. That's

647
01:48:55,060 --> 01:49:12,250
really cool though. Boom. Here's the B. If no one made it then you can claim that it's yours.

648
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:23,829
That's not how that works. I like how how like jacked I am. Sometimes I think about how big and

649
01:49:23,829 --> 01:49:30,470
strong I used to be and I go damn imagine if I was like that still and then I go no

650
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:39,210
because that took like five days a week every single fucking week. Constant constant care every

651
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:48,140
day for like two or three hours a day. It takes a lot especially when you're my size and I don't

652
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:56,380
mean that as like a I mean that as like a when you're like under like five ten when you're like five

653
01:49:57,180 --> 01:50:05,739
eight five nine and below it's hard to keep on fucking like 160 170 pounds. It's hard to do that

654
01:50:08,739 --> 01:50:14,439
especially when you have metabolism like I do. Those of you guys that are under six feet like

655
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:21,930
under five ten five eleven and you have like like fast metabolisms you putting weight on is

656
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:37,399
impossible. It was a full-time job for me to keep an extra 25 pounds on. Damn. Just eat forehead.

657
01:50:38,199 --> 01:50:49,850
Oh I did. I was eating tuna out of the can just right out of the can just as a snack in between

658
01:50:49,850 --> 01:51:07,909
meals like a fucking cat. I just turn upside down onto a plate and I would eat it or I wouldn't I

659
01:51:07,909 --> 01:51:16,789
would just open it and eat it out of the fucking can. That's nasty. I did what I had to do to get

660
01:51:16,789 --> 01:51:25,510
strong. You know how much protein I'm looking you right in the eye. Do you know how much protein is

661
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:40,460
packed in tuna fish sir or ma'am? You look pretty full right now. I do not I've lost I I have I have

662
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:53,189
lost like 20 pounds since 2012. I was like 170 in like 2012. I was a I was a fucking cement brick

663
01:51:53,189 --> 01:52:04,060
of a fucking man. Seriously I was oh I was just made out of cement and then I just you know

664
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:11,399
stopped. I started going less and less. Started my priorities started changing and I'm sorry I

665
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:16,220
just bumped you. Sorry I bumped you again. Now he's a little squishy. Yeah you get a little older too

666
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:26,020
and it's it gets harder to do. Contrary to popular belief I think once you cross like 30 35 years old

667
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:32,359
it's kind of hard to at least for me it was hard to like get to the gym like four days a week five

668
01:52:32,359 --> 01:52:39,689
days a week and like lift. I just was like it's like kind of not what I want to do right now.

669
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:50,500
Jesus you're old I thought you were 32. Keep thinking that. Now we'll be 32 up here for a

670
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:59,189
long time. Down here though from here down it's like a turtle shell. As long as I just keep a

671
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:16,539
fucking long sleeve shirt on and a turtleneck on I'll be good. Excuses. Hold on a minute hold on let

672
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:28,779
me let me drink the rest of my life like water and cigarette ashes. He's fragile now he is. I'm not

673
01:53:28,779 --> 01:53:36,100
going to tell you that I'm not. Here's a an album apparently that I am. Albertson the debut album.

674
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:47,880
Did you take this from eBay? Oh like this is an eBay photo right? Like this is an eBay photo

675
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:57,989
that you that you yoinked. I mean it's I get this is like pretty good like editing wise.

676
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:09,909
Parental advisory oh yeah I can't listen to that. No he's just saying yoink now. I don't think it's

677
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:18,789
edited. What are you talking? No no of course not. It's wait it's printed. Somebody printed this.

678
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:43,960
No they didn't. Did you? It's printed. Well let's hear it. What's in there? What's the CD?

679
01:54:44,760 --> 01:55:04,069
And there it is. The first album I ever did apparently. Something of a scientist. Nice.

680
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:17,720
Oh look at this. Lots of fireman stuff. I love it. Now this in particular. We got the one guy in

681
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:29,939
there. Got the slug. What else is in here? He got the watermark. Beautiful. This is great too. What

682
01:55:29,939 --> 01:55:43,960
else is in here? My favorite emote is in here. That emote will never be deleted. Term of chomp

683
01:55:45,449 --> 01:56:00,470
is the Saturn. All neatly packed into fireman's face. Fantastic. Very good with the

684
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:06,579
switching between. I'm not even going to pretend like I'm going to like talk about how what I

685
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:15,340
think. It looks good. I make myself probably sound stupider and stupider the more that I talk about

686
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:25,750
the line work. It just looks great. But I like what you did with the white on the outside.

687
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:29,109
It really makes it come out of the image. It separates it from the paper enough

688
01:56:29,909 --> 01:56:38,939
where it almost looks like a 3D image. You said my piece. You got an A. This is me scared.

689
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:51,859
He's an art major. Why does Jex have to be like three inches taller than me? That's not fair.

690
01:56:51,859 --> 01:56:59,689
We're the same person. If anything, Jex should be smaller because Jex is like a spirit that

691
01:56:59,689 --> 01:57:10,840
comes out of me and goes in and out. Shouldn't they be like a spirit that's like smaller? What

692
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:26,420
do you mean stand? He's stronger. Stand. Like you want me to stand up. I don't understand. I don't

693
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:34,060
know what that means. It's a JoJo reference. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know that everything

694
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:45,060
that was pink and blue is a JoJo reference. I didn't know that. I just I thought this is me.

695
01:57:45,060 --> 01:58:10,060
No, this is me. This is me and Jex. I know what this is. He doesn't get it. A stand is a some like

696
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:19,460
a summoned person. That's the worst noise of 2008 and 19. No, it's not. Bullshit. Bugle Boy

697
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:24,739
screaming into the urn is the worst noise ever on this channel. That happened like three weeks

698
01:58:24,739 --> 01:58:31,909
ago. There's no contest. There will not be a contest for that because that will beat it every

699
01:58:31,909 --> 01:58:47,579
time. Bugle Boy is like jeans. Bugle Berry. Bugle Boy. Bugle Boy is like clothes from the 90s.

700
01:58:50,229 --> 01:58:57,189
Bugle Berry screaming into the urn is the worst noise I've ever made while live on this channel.

701
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:07,659
Son of Bugle Berry. Bugle Boy. Streaming hot. Streaming cheesy.

702
01:59:08,619 --> 01:59:19,260
Cluck cluck is just cheesy chicken. New character. Bugle. I think this clip is too quiet. Hold on.

703
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:26,149
I'm going to warn you. I have not heard this in like three weeks. I'm going to play something

704
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:44,340
very loud right now. So I'm sorry, everybody. I need to hear what this sounds like. That's not it.

705
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:54,739
This is so much reverb. I was fucking shitting myself laughing at this

706
01:59:54,739 --> 02:00:03,989
because the reverb is insane. It's insane. I didn't know it was this much reverb.

707
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:21,239
Did you guys know that during this segment? Okay, listen, this is real. We're talking real talk

708
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:27,939
right now. I don't know if we talked about this already, but we may have. During that stream at

709
02:00:27,939 --> 02:00:34,579
about 8,000 to 9,000 concurrent viewers watching, there was like 8,700 people watching before we got

710
02:00:34,579 --> 02:00:45,619
to Bugle Berry. When Bugle Berry came on screen, almost 3,000 people left. It was like a catastrophe

711
02:00:45,619 --> 02:00:54,920
of viewers dropping. It was so hard to fucking not laugh at that. Oh my God.

712
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:03,720
Everything that I saw was like, dude, it's so loud and I can't hear fucking anything.

713
02:01:12,569 --> 02:01:18,250
When I watched clips of this, there it is. There's the eep. This is going to be really loud.

714
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:26,439
Loud, a loud warning coming up. Very loud. Seriously, I'm not kidding around. This is

715
02:01:26,439 --> 02:01:35,739
going to be very loud. When I was told, hey dude, we dropped like 3,000 viewers,

716
02:01:35,739 --> 02:02:00,739
I was just like, are you fucking serious? Oh my God. Holy shit. Oh my fucking God. That's so bad.

717
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:08,090
Holy shit. That's fucking loud. I can see it on the monitor.

718
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:31,479
There's more? 3,000 people left. If you want something funny about that stream,

719
02:02:31,479 --> 02:02:37,560
I'll give you another little tidbit of information. No joke. My actual reel, my mother

720
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:44,550
watched that stream and she said she watched it all. Right? So I'm just sitting there going,

721
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:52,149
holy shit. And she didn't say anything about Bugle Berry. The slime part was really funny.

722
02:02:52,149 --> 02:03:00,310
Wow, that was really interesting. Oh, thanks, mom. The trivia was really funny. She didn't skip

723
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:11,140
the middle 22 minutes of Bugle Berry. She even turned it off. Mom saw you in a diaper.

724
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:18,680
My mother saw me in a diaper when I was two, okay? Who cares? This is great, by the way.

725
02:03:56,060 --> 02:04:01,380
This is why we have to vet submissions. That was up for a very long time.

726
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:11,819
It's okay. No, it didn't even say what you think it did. It said whatever. Okay, this is sticks.

727
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:17,420
This is Sticks Renegade saying, Sticks, I'm going to draw your fursona. I said it like four years

728
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:38,920
ago and I just never did. I never did it. And spoiler alert, I never will. Reapplication.

729
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:43,479
Because I will butcher it. You're not going to like it. You're not going to like it. I'm telling

730
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:46,039
you, you think you want that, but then you're going to get it and you're going to be like,

731
02:04:46,039 --> 02:04:56,970
this is so bad. And it'll turn into merch. That's right. Chat will never let you forget this,

732
02:04:56,970 --> 02:05:01,850
Jeremy. And this is breaking news. The drawstrings of my pants just flopped directly into the urinal.

733
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:05,210
What the fuck do I even do now? I've been walking around like I'm wearing a diaper

734
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:13,899
because I don't want the drawstrings to touch me. I don't care. That's fine. That's a real problem

735
02:05:13,899 --> 02:05:19,909
that people can have. If you're wearing comfy pants and you go into a bathroom and you pull

736
02:05:19,909 --> 02:05:23,909
your comfy pants down and your underwear down to pee into the urinal and then you have these

737
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:30,229
long fucking strings that are like this long and they just went into the fucking urinal.

738
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:38,630
And what do I do now? What are you supposed to do? What do you do? You pull your pants down at

739
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:49,979
a urinal. No. Did you hear what I said before that? If you're wearing comfy pants that don't

740
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:56,140
have the hole that's in the middle of the pants, what do you do? Just pee through your pants?

741
02:05:56,779 --> 02:06:04,970
How are you supposed to go to the bathroom if you have like comfy pants on that do not have the

742
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:17,380
hole in the middle? Why do people think I'm talking about like dropping my pants to my ankles like

743
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:35,640
butters from South Park? What? Just use a stall. That was like a shit in there. No, I'm not doing

744
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:41,350
stall. I'm not doing stall roulette. If you go to a very, very public bathroom with a bunch of people

745
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:48,760
in it, people, you never know which one's going to have a person in it. Look, if there's like six

746
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:56,680
or seven stalls and there's like 40 people in 30 people in here, I don't know who's in there

747
02:07:05,989 --> 02:07:09,510
to lock. I don't know, but you don't want to walk up to a closed stall and be like,

748
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:15,829
go, go, go, go. Oh shit. Hey, I'm in here. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'll try the next one.

749
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:31,430
Look, no. What? Is somebody in there? No, cause stall. I'm talking. Look, I'm not talking about,

750
02:07:35,659 --> 02:07:41,739
they need to do, and this is an American bathroom problem because everyone's like,

751
02:07:41,739 --> 02:07:45,739
what are you talking about? When you go to, when you go on an airplane, listen to me,

752
02:07:45,739 --> 02:07:48,779
this is so important. This is the most important thing I'm going to talk about all day. When you

753
02:07:48,779 --> 02:07:56,460
go to an airport and you go in an airplane and there's bathrooms there, right? When you go in

754
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:01,340
and you close the door and you hit the little switch, a little fucking light is on. Just,

755
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:08,710
it just says that somebody's in it. No, no stalls in America have anything like that.

756
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:15,510
Only some of them do. For the most part, American toilets are like three pieces of sheet metal

757
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:24,180
that just sit hovering over the, off the ground and a lock that barely even goes forward enough

758
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:29,020
to lock the door. So if you want me to open a stall, if I don't know if somebody's in there,

759
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:37,270
the door's not actually locked. It will open. It's just, it's enough to just not have the door do

760
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:41,510
the stupid fucking thing that it does every time. When you go into a stall and you close the door

761
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:45,909
behind you, it just opens again. And you're like, get the fuck away from me. And then you,

762
02:08:45,909 --> 02:08:52,630
that's enough to make it so the door doesn't hover back and hit you. Have stalls, let it go all the

763
02:08:52,630 --> 02:09:00,859
way down. They don't have holes, huge gaps in the corners and make it so when you actually latch it,

764
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:06,060
there's a little light. It just has to be a fucking like 30 cent red and green LEDs.

765
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:24,170
Have it just be red or fucking green. Why is that so hard? It's easy. No joke, you're right about

766
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:28,970
this. Yeah, we've been doing toilet, we've been doing public bathrooms so incorrect in the United

767
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:36,819
States for like 60 years. We're just all peeing into walls and like standing behind fucking bricks

768
02:09:36,819 --> 02:09:44,979
of sheet metal. If I designed a bathroom, I would, I would probably win an award. I would win awards

769
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:49,960
for this. It's not going to be expensive. It could be more, it could be cheaper than it is now.

770
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:59,479
No, I just talked about urinals. I never talked about stalls. Do what airplanes do. It makes

771
02:09:59,479 --> 02:10:04,760
everyone so much more secure. You don't have to fucking worry about like the gaps in the fucking

772
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:11,640
stalls. Light, LED, red. I know that ones don't go in that one. That one is, is green. Now,

773
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:17,000
if you went into a stall and you didn't put on the fucking light that's red and it's green and

774
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:23,510
you got to fucking be aware of that. Okay. That's, that's a, that's a you problem.

775
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:33,140
You got to, if it's, if it's green, it means it's vacant. Otherwise you get into a problem there.

776
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:38,489
That's the one issue, but it'll be locked anyways. No, no, no. Cause you would do the thing to the

777
02:10:38,489 --> 02:10:43,579
airplane. You do think the airplanes do when it's locked, it's red. Done. I'll take a hundred million

778
02:10:43,579 --> 02:10:52,380
dollars in a grant please to redo every bathroom in fucking America. This already exists. Yes,

779
02:10:52,380 --> 02:11:00,300
it does. It does already exist on porta-potties. So porta-potties in the United States are better

780
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:08,409
than bathrooms in fucking public places that may have cost a hundred to $200,000 to make.

781
02:11:08,409 --> 02:11:25,399
A like $89 plastic box is better. I had to defend myself on this. $200,000 bathroom.

782
02:11:25,399 --> 02:11:29,000
How much do you think toilets are? How much do you think those stalls cost? How much do you think

783
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,510
every sink is? It's like a hundred fucking grant, 200 grand to make like a full like 20 toilet

784
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:46,779
bathroom. Nice. Hey, somebody just gave, uh, that was modest narcissist five community subs. Thank

785
02:11:46,779 --> 02:11:57,640
you. Modest narcissist. Appreciate it. Thank you. German has never been to a construction site

786
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:08,859
porta-potty. No guys. I don't like, I don't like go pull over on the side of the road to like,

787
02:12:08,859 --> 02:12:16,340
go use the bathroom at like the construction yard. I don't do that. Oh, I let me go to the

788
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:21,720
bathroom. That, that seems like a good one. Uh, German sucks. Thanks for five community subs.

789
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:29,659
Tingy five community subs. Thank you. Like three or four back to back to back to back five subs.

790
02:12:29,659 --> 02:12:39,420
Thanks guys. You're just too good for the common man's bathroom. I'm trying to improve the common

791
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:50,710
man's bathroom. I'm trying to improve it and make it better for everybody. What? Don't use my

792
02:12:50,710 --> 02:13:12,760
lightning hands. German 2020. Uh, no. Hey, there's baby boy, baby boy, baby boy. Being back Sonic.

793
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:25,300
I do that face. I have a urinal installed in my house. Bathrooms are overrated. That actually

794
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:35,640
would be kind of cool. I mean, it sounds like you got a lot of money. This is great though. Thank

795
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:45,800
you, uh, eternal for this beautiful profile picture esque being back Sonic. It's fantastic.

796
02:13:46,359 --> 02:14:03,189
How do I shit in public bathroom? We're not going to get started on this. People are going to think

797
02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:25,460
I'm insane. This is German lemur. There's like two or three of these in a row. Hey, there's a

798
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:38,300
German Naruto. I like the style. I still don't understand what they were thinking with this hat

799
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:44,710
though, with the hair. How would, cause you don't pull it down all the way. That's supposed to be

800
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:55,979
a headband, right? This is really good, uh, pencil work, pen work, whatever it is. It's very thin.

801
02:14:56,699 --> 02:15:02,810
It just goes under the hair. Yeah. But if I pull that down, that was sitting on the top of my head,

802
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:08,060
like all the way up to the top. If I had pulled that down, the top part would have gone over my

803
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:16,199
eyes. I was like balancing that like on the top of my forehead. Good. What do you mean good?

804
02:15:19,670 --> 02:15:28,149
You have a small skull. I know that's okay though, but no, this is great. Thank you for this.

805
02:15:28,949 --> 02:15:36,470
And we also have, uh, this is from the slime stream. That's me. I believe this is me.

806
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:56,090
That was not me driving by. So there we are. Distraught. That's a kind of a blurry photo though.

807
02:16:02,729 --> 02:16:10,699
What? Worm? What? Wormy? What is wormy? What do you mean? What do you, wait, what do you mean?

808
02:16:10,699 --> 02:16:24,630
What is that word? This is cool though. I'm a boomer. I don't, I don't know what that is.

809
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:34,360
It's a Splatoon thing. Oh, okay. Oh, all right. I get it. Have I ever played Splatoon? Maybe like

810
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:40,059
for an hour. Oh, okay. So this is like a Splatoon character or something. Oh, all right. Now it

811
02:16:40,059 --> 02:16:53,819
makes sense. Now it makes sense. Splatoon. Very cool. Uh, Jeremy Elbertson breaks down his career

812
02:16:53,819 --> 02:17:06,469
from the rat movie to Spider-Man, Vanity Fair. There's a little GIF involved us playing trivia.

813
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:15,559
German in 10 years. More like German in 40 years. I'll still have this face. This face

814
02:17:15,559 --> 02:17:22,680
ain't going anywhere. No, I eat way, I take way too much olive oil and way too much garlic and

815
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:38,739
avocado oil for this face to turn anywhere. I'm sorry. Dr. Schmikeson on the right. Minus two

816
02:17:38,739 --> 02:17:50,180
for me. I had more points than that. Sorry. I had way more points than that. BRB, stop streaming

817
02:17:50,180 --> 02:18:01,620
for a second. I need to go shit in my urinal. Oh, Dunkin Donuts because you're cool. This is,

818
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:13,940
look at this. Now that's what I call a good photo. All right. Here's, here's what I would change.

819
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:22,250
Okay. Get rid of the, uh, the don't sue me branding. Maybe a couple of little ice cubes

820
02:18:22,969 --> 02:18:29,450
and what's that like steam coming out like up here because it's cooling them off, but it's fire.

821
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:40,520
This is fucking amazing. Not out of his ass, like up like, like like little smoke.

822
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:50,069
This is fantastic work. I love this because this is what I do. This is just me every day.

823
02:18:51,209 --> 02:19:00,760
I just not Dunkin Donuts anymore. He has to say Dunk. I'm not saying that it's Dunkin Donuts

824
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:07,620
is the name of the store that you get this coffee from. I'm not going to say it. He hates it. Why

825
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:16,680
would I hate this? What I just said, it was my like, I like this one. I can't play favorites

826
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:23,459
because they're all, all of these are my wonderful children. I can't play favorites on them. He's a

827
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:32,860
liar. I hesitated because I didn't want to say favorite. It's great. Thank you for this. And

828
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:42,569
you got the CB BB cold blue, cold brew blueberry. You want the best coffee from Dunkin Donuts?

829
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:51,750
Cold brew ice coffee with blueberry. That does not say what you're saying in chat. Hate to break

830
02:19:51,750 --> 02:20:06,139
it to you. Ah, this is me as the giant rat. It seems equal parts is terrifying and interesting.

831
02:20:12,709 --> 02:20:17,430
You just, did you say the blueberry flavor at Dunkin Donuts is the worst, most disgusting flavor?

832
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:28,260
Sometimes I think I'm an alien on earth. When I read stuff like this, I feel like I'm like

833
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:36,090
from another planet. I have to be. Blueberry is the worst flavor from Dunkin. What are you,

834
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:54,389
a hazelnut guy? Oh, blueberry tea is shit. I must be from fucking Jupiter. Very, very good.

835
02:20:54,389 --> 02:21:04,420
Derma real life rat. Look at the claws. I even, I even have four fingers. You did your research.

836
02:21:08,950 --> 02:21:26,489
This is a painting of the hyper cam. Very accurate. It looks great. That's from, yeah,

837
02:21:26,489 --> 02:21:31,030
that's from condemned. Don't you wish you could go back and play a game again and wipe your brain

838
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:39,719
like we've talked about? I wish I could play condemned again. That game was so good, but this

839
02:21:39,719 --> 02:21:49,540
is paint or is it, is it tape? Hold on a second. Is this paint or tape? I'm seeing like a little

840
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:56,440
bunch of bunching up here and like bunching up. Is this a plastic bag? Hold on. Look down here.

841
02:21:57,399 --> 02:22:08,840
Is this like a plastic bag paint? No. Look at down here. Holy shit. Nice. It could be marker.

842
02:22:09,989 --> 02:22:19,450
You're stupid. Sometimes I seriously think I'm fucking, like, I was dropped off here and like

843
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:33,420
somebody booted me up. No, you. No, this is awesome. I love it. Roach Ranch Zoo Resort off

844
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:42,459
of exit 78 said to close amidst money laundering allegations. Roach Ranch. Roach murder. Okay.

845
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:51,399
Roach Ranch was such a great place though. I love Roach Ranch and of course you got the

846
02:22:51,399 --> 02:23:01,590
sign for Anthony for Anthony. You have to. I would love to go to like a bug zoo. People give bugs

847
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:07,350
such a bad rap. I mean, I hate them. They're disgusting. I really don't like bugs at all,

848
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:15,190
but like they get a bad rap because they're interesting. They're cool. They have like a

849
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:20,149
really, really, there's so many different species. There's so many different types of bugs and, and,

850
02:23:20,149 --> 02:23:26,840
and what? Because like, yeah, I'm just saying the bugs have a bad rap. I'm included in this. I don't

851
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:43,610
like bugs. There are like three bugs that I like. Praying mantis, butterflies, and like stag beetles

852
02:23:45,719 --> 02:24:00,059
and bees and ladybugs. Yeah, that's pretty much it. What about you? You killed a bee. No, I didn't.

853
02:24:01,139 --> 02:24:11,379
Those were wasps. Wasps are fucking murderers. Did somebody just say same thing? Bee and wasp.

854
02:24:11,379 --> 02:24:18,420
One of them is going to, is for the future of our planet and the other one kills for fun.

855
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:39,030
What are you talking about? Bad, that guy. Like hornets and wasps, they're like, they're murderers.

856
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:50,170
Hornets sometimes just, just destroy hives because they felt like it, bee hives,

857
02:24:50,170 --> 02:25:02,649
and just take it over for fun. Wasp pollinate. Bees do justice. Bees do very, very good. Bumble bees,

858
02:25:02,649 --> 02:25:19,190
honey bees, carpenter bees. There's wasps in chat. Hey, don't say that about us.

859
02:25:21,979 --> 02:25:28,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I might punch you in the face when we come across each other on the street,

860
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:46,489
but I pay taxes. What's wrong with that? I might break in your house and like eat all your food

861
02:25:46,489 --> 02:25:51,430
and like throw your fridge onto the ground, but I'm really good at fucking making pies.

862
02:25:52,069 --> 02:26:06,440
Did you know that? Fucking wasps and hornets. They're mean. They're aggressive and they're angry

863
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:28,469
all the time. This is German Lego. This is great. And Nvidia Greg made this. The Lego hair is

864
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:59,639
perfect. The seagull, the skeleton. This really does look, okay. I look like a Lazy Town villain.

865
02:26:59,719 --> 02:27:12,360
It's the hair. It's like that plastic-y kind of hair in the outfit. Yes, it's online thanks

866
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:27,030
to the five community subs. Yes. What would my gimmick be as a villain? I wouldn't have any

867
02:27:27,030 --> 02:27:43,129
gimmicks. I don't have gimmicks. Boring. Yeah, I'm just, it's just me. I just have like funny hair.

868
02:27:46,219 --> 02:27:53,770
I'm like every villain from all the Disney XD shows. Doesn't have any superpowers. Just dresses

869
02:27:53,770 --> 02:28:05,430
up in costumes and like is kind of fucking annoying, right? Just gets in the way of

870
02:28:06,149 --> 02:28:11,930
stuff that the main characters are doing. Happens to like pull the wrong lever,

871
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:23,590
like if I mess it up with my plan. Yeah, I wouldn't be a very good villain. Let's go.

872
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:28,520
Happy Thanksgiving. I hope you're hungry for some German turkey.

873
02:28:36,309 --> 02:28:43,079
There's a lot of grapes and fruits. I don't eat very much fruit on Thanksgiving.

874
02:28:43,829 --> 02:28:54,329
Look, there's apples in here. Tons of grapes. Apples. Oranges. Oranges. Oranges. Grapes.

875
02:28:56,459 --> 02:29:03,219
I don't eat fruit on Thanksgiving. I mean squash. Yeah, I mean, but that's, I eat squash, corn,

876
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:13,049
green beans. I don't, apples on Thanksgiving. Like apple pie. Not like, who eats like grapes like

877
02:29:14,010 --> 02:29:34,329
on fucking Thanksgiving. Do you guys do that? I've got to be. From Pluto. Nice work Dorkcube.

878
02:29:34,889 --> 02:29:50,069
You got the facial hair really, really spot on because that's all that happens.

879
02:29:54,489 --> 02:30:00,969
When I grow up my facial hair, it just looks like somebody took a stapler and just just went nuts

880
02:30:00,969 --> 02:30:15,139
with it. It's not good. But this on the other hand, this is good. No emotion for two minutes.

881
02:30:15,139 --> 02:30:19,290
Why would I do that? We're going over some great community art right now and then we're going to

882
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:26,229
go over community videos. Strap in for that one. We're almost done with this I think. Only a few

883
02:30:26,229 --> 02:30:37,100
more. But good doodle. Good work. This is from the, I believe the Space Ace stream, which is really

884
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:55,180
cool. Or is this a JoJo reference? Space Ace. It is now. No, it's not. Cowboy Bebop. I just saw,

885
02:30:55,180 --> 02:31:04,870
I saw the blue and I saw the like magenta. It's from neither. You guys got in my head here.

886
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:14,520
Everything, everything is JoJo if it's like brightly colored blue and magenta and like pink.

887
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:22,459
This is great though. There's the light gun. If you, by the way for some of the new viewers that

888
02:31:22,459 --> 02:31:29,979
might be here that haven't been here for a while. In this shirt, mind you, in this shirt I did on

889
02:31:29,979 --> 02:31:36,299
first try. I played light gun games which I'm very, very good at. First try I did the bonus round in

890
02:31:36,379 --> 02:31:41,739
point blank, which is almost impossible to do. It is physically nearly impossible to complete it.

891
02:31:41,739 --> 02:31:45,100
And I did it first try. That just, there's probably some new people here that don't know

892
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:58,500
my light gun skills. Humble brag. No, that was a regular brag. That was like bragging it to your

893
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:14,809
face. Awesome work though. And look at that. Good stuff. I like the glasses. I don't even have a

894
02:32:14,809 --> 02:32:21,450
pair of glasses like this. I should probably get some then. I'm a new viewer and I don't believe

895
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:32,549
you. Somebody linked the clip. It's ridiculous. And then I fell out the window. That hurt. I like

896
02:32:32,549 --> 02:32:41,399
the very, very nice glowing letters. It adds a lot. It does. No, not the haunted bugleberry 3000

897
02:32:41,399 --> 02:32:51,909
people leave the stream noise. Now this is very interesting too. It's a nice suit. Is this, that's

898
02:32:51,909 --> 02:33:01,479
the J. That's really cool. I didn't even know this was the J at first. And then that's me in a suit.

899
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:14,540
German 985. That's a Jojo stance, but whatever. That's how I stand. I actually do kind of stand

900
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:28,180
like that. I love it. You made the J this interesting, like Power Rangers villain.

901
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:46,700
That's awesome. He's my stand. You're such an old person. I haven't seen a television show.

902
02:33:48,920 --> 02:34:00,780
This is not like required reading in high school. I haven't seen this TV show. Yes, it is. Yes,

903
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:06,540
it is. Well, all right. When your high school starts to have Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as required

904
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:16,299
reading, then we'll talk. TV wasn't even invented yet. Not yet. This is really well done though.

905
02:34:16,299 --> 02:34:24,500
Is it like a heart monitor in the back? Like a, like a, what's that? One of those things.

906
02:34:25,059 --> 02:34:36,360
It's really cool. This is me fat. Like really fat. This is kind of how I feel right now.

907
02:34:39,739 --> 02:34:44,459
This is the clothes I wear every day. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What do you mean? Uh-oh.

908
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:58,579
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Stinky poopoo. What the fuck are you guys doing? Stinky poopoo? What are you guys

909
02:34:58,579 --> 02:35:06,840
fucking doing? It's a, oh, it's called, it's, it's, oh, right. Okay. It's like a meme thing.

910
02:35:07,559 --> 02:35:13,319
I look over it and I just see like a wave of people writing like, poopoo, stinky poopoo,

911
02:35:13,319 --> 02:35:20,459
and shit. I'm just like, what the fuck is going on over here? Like, why did this happen?

912
02:35:23,719 --> 02:35:27,879
No, I'm not watching meme video. All right. This is fucking fat Jeremy.

913
02:35:33,159 --> 02:35:51,290
The Rumblers. The Compact War. Holy shit. Look at that. What is that? Is that beanbag? Is somebody

914
02:35:51,290 --> 02:36:17,819
like in a beanbag Sonic? Is that like a cosplay? This is awesome. There's Dr. Jerma with the

915
02:36:17,819 --> 02:36:27,290
Infinity Gauntlet. Anyway, there's Batboy, Pac-Man. They're all here. Everybody's here.

916
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:41,430
Infinity War. Marvel's Smash Brothers. Poster. Let's get it. Poster. Everybody knows what I'm

917
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:52,579
saying. Poster. There's a Glooman. Like a pixelated version of Glooman's face, like we do have on the

918
02:36:52,579 --> 02:37:05,379
emote. Pretty, it's actually really good. I really like this. Watch it. Watch it. I'm not going to

919
02:37:05,379 --> 02:37:18,700
watch the stinky poopoo video. I'm not going to watch it. Please. Please. I'm not going to watch

920
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:29,219
it. No. I'll watch it. I'll watch it later like in bed. You're going to unsubscribe because I won't

921
02:37:29,219 --> 02:37:38,950
watch the uh-oh poopoo video. I don't know what to tell you on this one. I'll give you my review

922
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:47,180
next stream. It's cursed. I'll give you my review next stream. This is great though. Reminds me of

923
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:54,579
like a pixelated video game character. Unsubbing. I'm not going to... I don't want to watch this

924
02:37:54,579 --> 02:38:10,309
video. We got so many other videos to watch. Do reactions. Reaction now. He's going to lose

925
02:38:10,309 --> 02:38:15,899
3,000 viewers. No, I think I'll gain 3,000 viewers because I'm not going to watch that video.

926
02:38:16,629 --> 02:38:20,629
Because as many people that are writing this right now that want me to click that video,

927
02:38:20,629 --> 02:38:26,389
there's probably like two or three thousand people that are here still right now that don't want me

928
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:32,149
to watch it and will leave if I do. So what is it? What am I supposed to do here? Three thousand

929
02:38:32,149 --> 02:38:34,950
people will leave if I don't click it and three thousand people will leave if I do.

930
02:38:35,829 --> 02:38:48,520
What's the game plan here for me? Don't watch it. Damned if you do. Damned if you don't. Don't mind

931
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:58,010
if I don't. Oh all right. Everybody look what's on screen. The easiest way to make chat completely

932
02:38:58,010 --> 02:39:13,799
just focus on... dog on screen. Dog on camera. Dog on camera. This is cute. He's so chunky.

933
02:39:13,879 --> 02:39:19,780
He's like, you know, he's like a little black bear. That's what he looks like. He's so cute.

934
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:31,719
Yes, it's all love here with Otto. That's how I feel every morning. I just look at him and I'm

935
02:39:31,719 --> 02:39:45,399
like, you're the best. He's my best friend. Show Otto the video. I'm going to print out a picture

936
02:39:45,399 --> 02:39:55,159
of this video like a thumbnail of the video. I'm going to eat it on camera. This is very, very good.

937
02:39:55,799 --> 02:39:59,819
I love this. You know who's going to love this? Kim would like this really, really. She like

938
02:39:59,819 --> 02:40:07,000
loves drawings and pictures of Otto just like I do. This you probably go, what is this photo of?

939
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:20,149
Well, it's a photo of this. The coal miner. I still don't know why that even happened. That

940
02:40:20,149 --> 02:40:33,639
was so strange. I feel like it was worse than this at some point too. It's football germa.

941
02:40:37,459 --> 02:40:55,540
Look at that hair too. Look at that dusty hair. Somebody just wrote, do you guys have any idea

942
02:40:55,540 --> 02:41:02,260
how annoying this must be for Jeremy to see this over and over again? They won't pestering him.

943
02:41:10,389 --> 02:41:21,659
I will watch the first, I will listen to the first one second of this video. If it is not,

944
02:41:21,659 --> 02:41:26,120
if it is not what I want, if I will click off of it, if I do not want to watch this.

945
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:45,319
Okay. Don't give in. You know what? Fuck it. I'm not giving in. It's true. All right. What's next?

946
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:54,010
Is there anything left? Hey, look at that. This is from the last stream. Bunch of psychos in this

947
02:41:54,010 --> 02:42:04,409
mall. Erp. For the love of God, Frank, put on some shoes. This is great. This was like a few

948
02:42:04,409 --> 02:42:16,329
days ago. Not all heroes wear capes. They just don't click poo poo videos. If that's the criteria

949
02:42:16,329 --> 02:42:28,260
to be a hero, we've got a long way to go. Not all heroes wear shoes. Not all heroes wear shoes.

950
02:42:28,899 --> 02:42:39,450
This is great. Thank you. Thank you, Multitrip. You did the watermark too. Good. And ladies and

951
02:42:39,450 --> 02:43:08,059
gentlemen, there's one more. There's one more. This is just fucking crazy. Watch this. This is

952
02:43:08,059 --> 02:43:14,579
what happens. You know what? It might seem like weird for you guys to see this, but this is the

953
02:43:14,579 --> 02:43:26,090
type of technology that actually existed back in like NBA 2K 11. This is what it actually looked

954
02:43:26,090 --> 02:43:36,889
like when you did this. Like NBA 2K, like 2009. It was this scary. But I don't even know how you

955
02:43:36,889 --> 02:43:42,409
must've just mapped my... That horrible face is that same image. I'm not going to click on the ad

956
02:43:45,659 --> 02:43:58,100
under any circumstance. Jesus. But that concludes the... I just clicked on the fucking ad accidentally,

957
02:43:58,100 --> 02:44:06,979
didn't I? No, I didn't. Thank God. That concludes the images portion of the stream today. We're

958
02:44:06,979 --> 02:44:11,540
going to move on to the videos. And we got a bunch of these. We have a lot to go through.

959
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:17,860
So I told you there was a lot this time. I wasn't lying. There was a shitload of images and there's

960
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:47,690
a shitload of videos too. I'm done. I'm not watching anymore. No, I'm done. I'm not watching

961
02:44:47,690 --> 02:45:08,579
anymore of this. That was interesting. So first up, we've got... I need everyone to see this just

962
02:45:08,579 --> 02:45:44,899
because this first one's called The Ring. It's called The Ring. I have to make myself a little

963
02:45:44,899 --> 02:45:50,760
smaller because I don't want to get in the way of any of these videos because that's what we're here

964
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:54,200
for. We're here for the videos. And I also want to turn this way to be able to watch them with you.

965
02:45:54,920 --> 02:46:03,579
Let's go this way. Sit here and make sure I'm in a good spot to view. I need a good viewing angle.

966
02:46:07,299 --> 02:46:23,290
Okay, here we go. There's a videotape.

967
02:46:40,409 --> 02:46:45,690
I went to a field trip today. The teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer.

968
02:46:46,409 --> 02:47:05,479
That's the whole video. That's the whole video. It's not even... Again? You want to see it again?

969
02:47:05,559 --> 02:47:07,879
Fine. We encores some of them.

970
02:47:31,479 --> 02:47:36,760
I went to a field trip today. The teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer.

971
02:47:42,219 --> 02:47:50,940
Why? But why The Ring? But why The Ring? That was The Ring.

972
02:47:53,299 --> 02:47:58,180
Coming up next. You're gonna get flashed every time. I'm sorry. I'm gonna take a photo of you.

973
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:01,379
This is called Compact Python and the Holy Sippy.

974
02:48:51,079 --> 02:48:55,670
And it's... You gotta do... You're gonna... You're gonna hoo on me here? Hold on.

975
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:09,879
Anger in the face. Look at that. I look fucking so mean and fucked up. That was a JoJo reference.

976
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:16,870
No, it's not. That's... This is not... That's... Is that Eric Andre?

977
02:49:17,590 --> 02:49:28,790
How's that a JoJo reference? That's because of the arrow. Oh, well, that was... That was very...

978
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:36,120
That was very good. Classic scene from a classic movie, if you haven't seen it. This is... Jerma

979
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:42,979
slaps himself a lot. So you can... You can imagine what this one might look like. Oh, you want to

980
02:49:42,979 --> 02:49:50,010
fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't... It actually sounds pretty

981
02:49:50,010 --> 02:50:32,069
good. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't... That's

982
02:50:32,069 --> 02:50:56,170
a pretty good ending. What was that last clip from? It's from the carnival. Jerma streams watching

983
02:50:56,170 --> 02:51:03,670
videos just like I'm doing right now. That was pretty fucking crazy. That's... You know what?

984
02:51:03,670 --> 02:51:06,469
That takes a lot of time because he's something... Maybe it's somebody you've hit at editing,

985
02:51:06,469 --> 02:51:14,700
aficionados. Don't know. Every single one of these slaps had to be placed on a timeline

986
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:18,620
at the right second. You want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't...

987
02:51:19,579 --> 02:51:33,110
That's like four hours of work right there. Right there. This is literally... It takes hours

988
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:42,440
to do this. There's a musical timeline. You've still got to place it though. What is FL Studio,

989
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:55,799
by the way? I don't know. Local streamer is a door-to-door salesman starring Homer Simpson on a big

990
02:51:55,799 --> 02:52:27,899
beanbag chair. Hello? Yes? Hello? Yes? What the fuck? This is called Jerma Trek. Jerma Trek.

991
02:52:54,969 --> 02:53:01,930
Frontier. These are the voyagers of the Starship Ent... Oh, look! It's the fucking Enterprise!

992
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:10,899
Welcome to Star Trek, the next generation! Captain Picard, Jean-Luc... Motherfucking...

993
02:53:10,899 --> 02:53:19,479
Captain's Log, 5125, the board! Get out of the fucking way!

994
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:38,969
Shut up! Understood. Get in the car.

995
02:53:40,870 --> 02:54:06,549
Why am I sneaking? Hey, man. Welcome to the stream. My name's Jerma. Nice to meet you. Right

996
02:54:06,549 --> 02:54:10,629
there. Bingo! Right there. That's the follow button. If you click that, every so often you're

997
02:54:10,629 --> 02:54:15,909
getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...

998
02:54:17,030 --> 02:54:23,030
We are the board. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add to a biological and

999
02:54:23,030 --> 02:54:30,299
technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to serve us. Resistance is...

1000
02:54:30,299 --> 02:54:37,129
Hey, boys and girls, looks like we got a pass. Hey, look at me! Look at me! That's what you do.

1001
02:54:39,459 --> 02:55:04,170
Ah! Yeah, that's right! This is fucking ridiculous. Uh-oh!

1002
02:55:06,170 --> 02:55:23,770
Oh, shit! Zombies! This is fucking ridiculous. He actually shoots them.

1003
02:55:25,750 --> 02:55:43,049
Fuck you! Why do I have to do that everywhere? What? Why is this so... Why is it so low?

1004
02:55:48,899 --> 02:55:50,899
Yeah! What happened to the audio?

1005
02:55:53,639 --> 02:56:03,370
Oh my god. Uh... The best part about this whole video was the... This part here is my favorite

1006
02:56:03,370 --> 02:56:07,930
part. The... The... What a... The look at... There's... Welcome to the stream.

1007
02:56:08,889 --> 02:56:14,780
You're getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...

1008
02:56:15,899 --> 02:56:21,620
We are the board. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add to a... Badass!

1009
02:56:23,059 --> 02:56:29,239
Hey, look at me! Look at me! That's what you do. Ah! Yeah!

1010
02:56:29,239 --> 02:56:34,760
Am I gonna scare him? Oh, I can't wait to get in front of the fucking camera and do this again.

1011
02:56:35,819 --> 02:56:41,979
You guys put these clips in such great places. You get in like six or seven more hours of stuff

1012
02:56:41,979 --> 02:56:50,629
to use. I can't wait. In another two or three weeks, I'm doing it again. That was so... That was

1013
02:56:50,629 --> 02:56:59,139
awesome. That was Germa Trek. Uh, this is Dick Richard versus Fat Germa, a test of strength.

1014
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:20,069
Wait, this is like a real... You guys did this in real life?

1015
02:57:20,069 --> 02:57:27,670
I thought that was a TV show. That's the whole real costume.

1016
02:57:40,659 --> 02:57:43,819
It's a better costume than what was actually in the video.

1017
02:57:44,700 --> 02:58:00,059
No, you don't reveal! You don't reveal the face! You don't reveal the face!

1018
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:10,360
Now everybody knows who's under there. Uh, I gotta tell you that this costume is better

1019
02:58:10,360 --> 02:58:19,719
than the costume that was in the actual wrestling event. Like, holy shit. That's

1020
02:58:19,719 --> 02:58:29,190
one-to-one. Correct. Excellent job. Is this canon? This is a dream of somebody. Somebody... This is

1021
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:38,680
somebody had a dream of the wrestling event. And then it was down here. Is it canon? It's

1022
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:47,100
canon in a dream. Like, it's a dream canon. That was called Dick Richard versus Fat Germa,

1023
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:55,770
a test of strength. Uh, Germa plays as the best video game character in, uh, video game character

1024
02:58:55,770 --> 02:59:01,209
in gaming history. Oh, I'll show you where I'm gonna play. I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2 as the

1025
02:59:01,209 --> 02:59:06,090
pyromaniac. I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as Hackman.

1026
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:22,889
Okay, that was fucking pretty good. That was really good. Oh, I'll show you where I'm gonna play. I'm

1027
02:59:22,889 --> 02:59:30,090
gonna play Team Fortress 2 as the pyromaniac. I'm gonna be playing Team Fortress 2 as Hackman.

1028
02:59:37,639 --> 02:59:41,559
That, like, I mean, I can go pretty high, but I don't think I can go that high.

1029
02:59:46,739 --> 02:59:49,959
That was pretty good. I'm gonna play. I'm gonna play.

1030
02:59:54,920 --> 03:00:06,139
That was close. I love the really, really quick ones that just get right to the point. It's just

1031
03:00:06,139 --> 03:00:12,620
right here. It's just like 10 seconds. It's just, I had, I made this and just show it. It's fucking,

1032
03:00:12,620 --> 03:00:19,139
I love it. Uh, Germa fights Crash PlayStation for the fate of nothing in particular in cinematic

1033
03:00:19,139 --> 03:00:27,899
widescreen. Well, actually, this is like, this is actually probably nine. This is probably like

1034
03:00:27,899 --> 03:00:48,780
14 by 7. I'm back. It's time for you to pay. Yeah, do I actually find him? He's not looking at me.

1035
03:00:49,579 --> 03:00:52,170
I've never seen a bandicoot before.

1036
03:01:12,899 --> 03:01:23,989
Not the boulder. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't want to. Dude, dude, that's just a

1037
03:01:23,989 --> 03:01:26,870
taste of the balling that I'm about to do over here. All right.

1038
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,840
Not bad dodging.

1039
03:01:49,459 --> 03:01:50,579
How's it going grandpa?

1040
03:02:00,569 --> 03:02:01,049
All right.

1041
03:02:01,530 --> 03:02:08,489
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Rewind. Tevo. Tevo. I want to see this again.

1042
03:02:12,250 --> 03:02:17,190
You're going down. Boom. All right. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1043
03:02:21,350 --> 03:02:27,110
Spoilers for Infinity War. If you haven't seen it yet, you have. You've fucking seen Infinity War.

1044
03:02:27,909 --> 03:02:51,159
It changed. Spoiler. What? Why are you making me go? How many times did I do this?

1045
03:03:07,909 --> 03:03:27,690
I don't. Diablo 4 cinematic trip. You're going down. That's my favorite part. How's it going grandpa?

1046
03:03:33,350 --> 03:03:38,899
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You're going down. You're going down.

1047
03:03:40,569 --> 03:03:56,170
That was awesome. Clip that face. Dude, uh, this is, I got a warning for you on this one.

1048
03:03:56,969 --> 03:04:02,440
This one might be scary. I just, I've seen the thumbnails on all these pretty much.

1049
03:04:03,239 --> 03:04:08,180
I've seen the first images and this could, this couldn't bite scare small children. So

1050
03:04:08,899 --> 03:04:14,459
get them out of the room. Okay.

1051
03:04:20,459 --> 03:04:23,340
Hey.

1052
03:04:40,920 --> 03:04:44,760
There's more.

1053
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:49,559
Um, I didn't even go on a diet. It's not a bad idea. Why is it more?

1054
03:05:12,170 --> 03:05:13,129
I actually like this a lot.

1055
03:05:13,129 --> 03:05:29,350
Just this part right here. The very first part.

1056
03:05:31,909 --> 03:05:36,469
That ABC EDFG. I don't even know how to fucking do the alphabet.

1057
03:05:37,739 --> 03:05:40,219
Put the links in the chat, put the links in the chat, put the link in the chat,

1058
03:05:40,219 --> 03:05:43,979
put the link in the chat, put the link in the chat. Hold on. I need to put the link in the chat,

1059
03:05:43,979 --> 03:05:49,780
put the link in the chat. Oh, we're not, we're not even 20% of the way through these videos.

1060
03:05:49,780 --> 03:06:03,420
Put the link in the chat. I don't want you to see them. That's why I'm hiding them right now.

1061
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:10,200
There is the link for that video. I don't want there to be any spoilers.

1062
03:06:13,159 --> 03:06:24,469
Let's do the next one. This is called 1 a.m. news animatic. I think I, yeah, I know what this is.

1063
03:06:24,469 --> 03:06:30,069
This is, hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 1 a.m. news where we're reporting on a

1064
03:06:30,069 --> 03:06:35,190
local streamer who has gone insane and left his home. Hello ladies and gentlemen.

1065
03:06:37,430 --> 03:06:50,520
Fucking naked. Fucking naked. Am I actually naked? Oh fuck.

1066
03:06:50,520 --> 03:07:00,629
Remember who has gone insane and left his home. Hello ladies and gentlemen.

1067
03:07:00,629 --> 03:07:09,899
Naked. It's not, I'm not naked. That's an image of my chest. It's one frame of nudity.

1068
03:07:09,899 --> 03:07:17,450
No, I had like underwear on. I had shorts on. It says,

1069
03:07:17,450 --> 03:07:19,209
Jerma goes for an evening stroll in the woods.

1070
03:08:12,219 --> 03:08:16,040
You getting anything, Jeff? I'm not seeing anything on the thermal.

1071
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:28,149
Hello? Is that me? Is that actually his iPhone?

1072
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:33,989
Dad, you hear that? Gone. Something took off running.

1073
03:08:33,989 --> 03:08:37,110
Let's move that way. Stay tight, guys.

1074
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:40,540
Look at this trapper. What the hell broke that off?

1075
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:43,420
Something bit just hanging on a splinter back there, so be careful.

1076
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:44,459
Yeah. Yeah.

1077
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:47,420
Holy crap. What the fuck was that?

1078
03:08:49,579 --> 03:08:50,540
That's right there. Right there.

1079
03:08:50,540 --> 03:08:53,739
She's trying to go to the house. Let's get this son of a bitch right now.

1080
03:08:53,739 --> 03:08:56,459
Come on, close in on him. Really, dude? Really?

1081
03:08:56,459 --> 03:09:00,459
Find out how to go, Jeff. I'm looking right in there. I can't see shit.

1082
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:06,700
Talk to me. It's right there. It went over the hill.

1083
03:09:06,700 --> 03:09:08,459
You see that buck? Listen.

1084
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:17,959
Holy crap. How about you, son of a bitch, how?

1085
03:09:18,680 --> 03:09:23,860
Don't howl. He's pissed.

1086
03:09:24,500 --> 03:09:26,659
Yes, he's pissed. We just heard something howl

1087
03:09:26,659 --> 03:09:29,379
here in the woods, and it was huge. It was intimidating.

1088
03:09:29,379 --> 03:09:31,459
It was huge. It was super, super loud.

1089
03:09:36,420 --> 03:09:38,180
I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.

1090
03:09:39,940 --> 03:09:41,459
Holy crap. What the fuck was that?

1091
03:09:41,459 --> 03:09:45,059
Nothing to do with this. It's right there.

1092
03:09:45,059 --> 03:09:46,340
Right there. She's trying to go to the house.

1093
03:09:46,979 --> 03:09:49,700
Let's get this son of a bitch right now. Come on, close in on him.

1094
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:52,260
Really, dude? Really? Find out how to go, Jeff.

1095
03:09:53,379 --> 03:09:55,219
I'm looking right in there. I can't see shit.

1096
03:09:57,860 --> 03:10:01,459
Talk to me. It's right there. It went over the hill.

1097
03:10:01,459 --> 03:10:03,219
You see that buck? Listen.

1098
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:12,760
Holy crap. How about you, son of a bitch, how?

1099
03:10:17,860 --> 03:10:18,659
He's pissed.

1100
03:10:20,469 --> 03:10:26,389
Uh, this TV show, they just go in the woods and pretend to be chasing Bigfoot?

1101
03:10:28,629 --> 03:10:31,030
I'm more interested in this television show.

1102
03:10:31,030 --> 03:10:36,020
Yes, he's pissed.

1103
03:10:36,739 --> 03:10:38,340
We just heard something howl here in the woods.

1104
03:10:40,969 --> 03:10:45,579
Not just Bigfoot. How many other monsters are there out in the woods?

1105
03:10:46,379 --> 03:10:51,159
There's animals in the woods. There are bears. There are deer.

1106
03:10:51,799 --> 03:10:56,649
There's like wolves, bugs and shit, like frogs.

1107
03:10:58,780 --> 03:11:00,379
What monsters are in the woods?

1108
03:11:01,100 --> 03:11:10,520
The mothman. It's the devil.

1109
03:11:12,729 --> 03:11:15,530
It's a yeti. It's a vulnerable snowman.

1110
03:11:16,250 --> 03:11:27,370
They have like 11 seasons of getting just misinterpretations of bears making noise.

1111
03:11:29,459 --> 03:11:39,020
Really? All effectively that's happening right here is just a bunch of guys

1112
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:43,350
are stumbling through the woods like irritating and scaring animals.

1113
03:11:43,350 --> 03:11:48,389
What do you got, Jeff?

1114
03:11:48,389 --> 03:11:49,030
You got anything?

1115
03:11:49,030 --> 03:11:49,510
Flashlight.

1116
03:11:49,510 --> 03:11:50,309
Walking right up here.

1117
03:11:51,270 --> 03:11:52,760
It's not real far away.

1118
03:11:53,399 --> 03:11:55,590
It's not.

1119
03:11:55,590 --> 03:11:56,709
And they got like guns?

1120
03:11:58,229 --> 03:12:02,549
I've never seen a movie. Don't you know that like you're going after like Bigfoot with

1121
03:12:02,549 --> 03:12:05,430
what is this a fucking like a shotgun? It's not going to work.

1122
03:12:06,069 --> 03:12:08,280
The guns aren't even real.

1123
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:13,979
Bigfoot is you're not going to kill him with a shotgun.

1124
03:12:15,159 --> 03:12:19,719
You might be able to kill Bigfoot with like a large rock that you hold over.

1125
03:12:19,719 --> 03:12:22,920
Like it has to be as big as like it's like a boulder and you drop it on him.

1126
03:12:23,860 --> 03:12:25,780
You're going to shoot him with like a pellet gun.

1127
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:30,040
These guys, they can't even see anything.

1128
03:12:30,040 --> 03:12:31,319
What are you going to shoot at? You're going to miss.

1129
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:33,860
Real far away.

1130
03:12:34,739 --> 03:12:35,610
He's up there.

1131
03:12:35,610 --> 03:12:36,170
I don't see any.

1132
03:12:38,489 --> 03:12:44,549
They have these minor helmets on that can only see maybe like three or four feet in

1133
03:12:44,549 --> 03:12:52,870
front of them. If Bigfoot is running at you from 200 feet away, you need floodlights and traps and

1134
03:12:54,229 --> 03:12:55,829
they're not helmets. They're just bands.

1135
03:12:56,469 --> 03:13:02,600
This is an in- I want to watch this show. What is this show actually called?

1136
03:13:04,379 --> 03:13:04,879
Yeah.

1137
03:13:05,659 --> 03:13:07,020
Rustling leaves in the woods.

1138
03:13:09,190 --> 03:13:10,149
Not real far away.

1139
03:13:10,950 --> 03:13:13,670
It's called Mountain Monsters.

1140
03:13:18,540 --> 03:13:19,579
Mountain Monsters.

1141
03:13:23,799 --> 03:13:25,159
Have they ever found a guy camping?

1142
03:13:27,079 --> 03:13:28,440
Heard that noise over there.

1143
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:29,639
There's somebody over there.

1144
03:13:29,639 --> 03:13:33,639
Yeah. And there's a guy just with like a fucking Campbell suit and he's just like,

1145
03:13:33,639 --> 03:13:35,399
hello, you guys all right?

1146
03:13:35,399 --> 03:13:43,819
That's called live footage from the Vegas region.

1147
03:13:43,819 --> 03:13:45,180
Pokemon Shpee.

1148
03:13:45,180 --> 03:13:59,899
I don't know. I don't know. I don't understand his preference.

1149
03:13:59,899 --> 03:14:03,350
No, no, you do it.

1150
03:14:04,870 --> 03:14:05,510
You do it.

1151
03:14:06,149 --> 03:14:08,920
I'm sleeping.

1152
03:14:15,139 --> 03:14:15,639
Yeah.

1153
03:14:16,340 --> 03:14:17,139
What am I here?

1154
03:14:17,860 --> 03:14:19,579
Okay, mom.

1155
03:14:39,260 --> 03:14:40,459
Five more minutes, mom.

1156
03:14:46,229 --> 03:14:46,729
Jesus.

1157
03:14:49,459 --> 03:14:54,180
So what- wait, Pokemon did a 24-hour stream where it showed Pokemon sleeping?

1158
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:00,170
Why did they do that?

1159
03:15:04,739 --> 03:15:06,659
It was live from a region in the game.

1160
03:15:08,219 --> 03:15:09,659
It was worse than that.

1161
03:15:09,659 --> 03:15:13,959
So wait, it just showed like a picture on screen?

1162
03:15:13,959 --> 03:15:16,440
It showed nothing and rustling bushes and a horse.

1163
03:15:17,239 --> 03:15:24,250
So you tell me that Mountain Monsters has more content in it than the Pokemon live stream.

1164
03:15:29,450 --> 03:15:30,729
Interesting stuff.

1165
03:15:30,729 --> 03:15:34,620
This is called Lego Intruder Germa in the Bathroom Tiles.

1166
03:15:35,739 --> 03:15:37,420
We're gonna go to Lego. This is good.

1167
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:38,219
Let's give it a go.

1168
03:15:38,219 --> 03:15:42,500
What the fuck are these?

1169
03:15:43,139 --> 03:15:45,940
Would you like some stationery?

1170
03:15:48,139 --> 03:15:49,420
We don't want to use- don't use those.

1171
03:15:51,370 --> 03:15:53,209
What are these? These are like notebooks.

1172
03:15:53,930 --> 03:15:54,889
Those explode.

1173
03:15:54,889 --> 03:15:55,930
Yeah, these explode.

1174
03:15:56,649 --> 03:15:57,530
Yeah, they detonate.

1175
03:15:57,530 --> 03:16:01,049
Yeah, if you throw one, you know, let's say at your feet and then you detonate it,

1176
03:16:02,010 --> 03:16:03,690
Are you sure these aren't bathroom tiles?

1177
03:16:04,969 --> 03:16:05,610
Holy shit.

1178
03:16:07,290 --> 03:16:09,209
This is like custom-made.

1179
03:16:11,299 --> 03:16:12,420
What the fuck is going on?

1180
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:13,299
I don't even know.

1181
03:16:13,299 --> 03:16:14,659
Is there a game?

1182
03:16:14,659 --> 03:16:15,860
Is there a game here?

1183
03:16:16,819 --> 03:16:17,459
I don't know.

1184
03:16:18,420 --> 03:16:22,360
When do we start the game?

1185
03:16:24,579 --> 03:16:25,079
Pizza!

1186
03:16:26,100 --> 03:16:26,600
Oh!

1187
03:16:29,940 --> 03:16:30,440
Whoa.

1188
03:16:31,059 --> 03:16:32,100
Holy shit.

1189
03:16:32,100 --> 03:16:33,780
That guy got destroyed.

1190
03:16:33,780 --> 03:16:34,280
Pizza!

1191
03:16:35,959 --> 03:16:37,159
This is really well done.

1192
03:16:37,159 --> 03:16:39,000
This is really well fucking made.

1193
03:16:42,680 --> 03:16:44,360
Are you sure these aren't bathroom tiles?

1194
03:16:49,030 --> 03:16:51,030
2006 stop motion animation.

1195
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:52,309
This is way better than that.

1196
03:16:52,309 --> 03:16:53,110
What the fuck is going on?

1197
03:16:53,110 --> 03:16:53,909
I don't even know.

1198
03:16:53,909 --> 03:16:55,350
Is there a game?

1199
03:16:55,350 --> 03:16:56,549
Is there a game here?

1200
03:16:57,510 --> 03:16:58,149
I don't know.

1201
03:17:01,500 --> 03:17:03,020
When do we start the game?

1202
03:17:05,239 --> 03:17:05,739
Pizza!

1203
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:07,959
So loud, I'm sorry.

1204
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:10,500
That's for the intruder stream.

1205
03:17:12,219 --> 03:17:12,700
Memories.

1206
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:20,059
Not louder.

1207
03:17:20,059 --> 03:17:20,559
Softer.

1208
03:17:21,639 --> 03:17:22,139
Softer.

1209
03:17:23,670 --> 03:17:25,590
This one's called Uh-oh, Germa.

1210
03:17:25,590 --> 03:17:26,149
Should I be a...

1211
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:28,069
Oh no, I know what this is.

1212
03:17:28,790 --> 03:17:29,290
Do I?

1213
03:17:35,319 --> 03:18:06,950
I thought the uh-oh thing was somebody pooping or something.

1214
03:18:10,979 --> 03:18:12,340
Stop the video now.

1215
03:18:13,299 --> 03:18:13,799
What?

1216
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:19,319
That was Uh-oh, Germa.

1217
03:18:19,319 --> 03:18:19,719
That was...

1218
03:18:20,280 --> 03:18:22,760
I kind of need to blink a few times after seeing that one.

1219
03:18:22,760 --> 03:18:28,420
This one's called Where's Germa?

1220
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:28,920
Where is he?

1221
03:18:46,790 --> 03:18:48,790
Where's France?

1222
03:18:59,879 --> 03:19:00,379
I'm here.

1223
03:19:28,969 --> 03:19:30,010
That one was interesting.

1224
03:19:30,729 --> 03:19:32,620
That was an interesting one.

1225
03:19:34,299 --> 03:19:35,100
What was that?

1226
03:19:36,059 --> 03:19:39,739
There was people looking where countries were in Europe.

1227
03:19:40,700 --> 03:19:45,420
And then I showed up and screamed and then the video was ending.

1228
03:19:48,149 --> 03:19:50,069
I don't know what happened in this video.

1229
03:19:51,399 --> 03:19:52,760
There was an EU meme.

1230
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:54,280
Oh, it's North America.

1231
03:19:55,540 --> 03:19:56,040
I don't know.

1232
03:19:57,829 --> 03:20:01,670
This is Michael's Rat's Redneck Birthday Party Remix.

1233
03:20:01,670 --> 03:20:06,629
World's first rodent superstar year.

1234
03:20:06,629 --> 03:20:22,950
Uh, Shazzo.

1235
03:20:24,149 --> 03:20:24,790
Shazzoip.

1236
03:20:25,590 --> 03:20:27,750
Shazzoip just gave 20 community subs.

1237
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:36,459
This works pretty well.

1238
03:20:44,540 --> 03:20:47,190
Michael Jackson.

1239
03:20:52,120 --> 03:21:11,299
What's up with the music?

1240
03:21:19,450 --> 03:21:20,649
That was fucking funny.

1241
03:21:21,850 --> 03:21:22,969
That was good.

1242
03:21:22,969 --> 03:21:23,850
That was good.

1243
03:21:23,850 --> 03:21:24,809
That was really good.

1244
03:21:24,809 --> 03:21:25,290
I liked...

1245
03:21:25,290 --> 03:21:26,489
I really like that one a lot.

1246
03:21:26,489 --> 03:21:26,989
I do.

1247
03:21:27,530 --> 03:21:28,329
That was great.

1248
03:21:29,290 --> 03:21:35,139
Oh, it was such a good boy this year.

1249
03:21:40,299 --> 03:21:41,819
This is called Tropical Trouble.

1250
03:21:42,459 --> 03:21:43,420
Tropical Trouble.

1251
03:21:43,420 --> 03:21:44,219
I wonder what that means.

1252
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:55,379
Bumble Buck Productions.

1253
03:21:56,889 --> 03:21:59,209
Called Fast German Triple Alien.

1254
03:21:59,209 --> 03:22:00,090
It's this again.

1255
03:22:01,879 --> 03:22:03,000
In Tropical Trouble.

1256
03:22:27,370 --> 03:22:29,690
Why do we both have steering wheels?

1257
03:22:29,690 --> 03:22:30,969
Wouldn't that be counterproductive?

1258
03:22:32,969 --> 03:22:40,469
A co-pilot?

1259
03:22:41,479 --> 03:22:43,319
But not when you're both turning at the same time.

1260
03:22:43,639 --> 03:22:44,139
Yup.

1261
03:22:54,219 --> 03:22:56,780
Now they must work together to survive on the island.

1262
03:22:58,940 --> 03:23:01,020
It is Purple Alien's job to look for food.

1263
03:23:02,299 --> 03:23:05,100
While Fast German will build a shelter.

1264
03:23:06,059 --> 03:23:19,719
Fuck am I...

1265
03:23:26,579 --> 03:23:27,879
It's a coconut.

1266
03:23:27,879 --> 03:23:28,680
What the fuck is that?

1267
03:23:28,680 --> 03:23:29,639
It's a coconut.

1268
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:32,840
How do I not know what a coconut is?

1269
03:23:36,860 --> 03:23:38,139
A full turkey dinner.

1270
03:23:38,139 --> 03:23:38,780
I don't want that.

1271
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:44,629
Oh, it's an alien.

1272
03:23:44,629 --> 03:23:45,510
You're right.

1273
03:23:45,510 --> 03:24:17,239
I love the purpose.

1274
03:24:32,969 --> 03:24:35,129
Now it's getting dark and they have no food or shelter.

1275
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:50,139
That's it.

1276
03:24:50,139 --> 03:24:51,180
So they decide to leave.

1277
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:05,670
How did we get in the helicopter again?

1278
03:25:08,219 --> 03:25:09,739
The helicopter just sucked him up.

1279
03:25:10,979 --> 03:25:15,540
That was Fast German and Purple Alien in Tropical Trouble.

1280
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:22,459
This is called Germacraft The Breakdown.

1281
03:25:25,979 --> 03:25:27,979
Already got a great caricature in this chair.

1282
03:25:51,319 --> 03:25:52,120
What's going on?

1283
03:26:02,309 --> 03:26:03,270
Why am I crying?

1284
03:26:03,670 --> 03:26:08,389
You can tell this is real because listen to my voice.

1285
03:26:08,950 --> 03:26:09,829
It's like stuffed up.

1286
03:26:14,870 --> 03:26:15,829
Was it just shit face?

1287
03:26:17,500 --> 03:26:18,780
You were Omega drunk.

1288
03:26:24,149 --> 03:26:26,629
That is actual Omega drunk.

1289
03:26:26,629 --> 03:26:27,190
Listen to this.

1290
03:26:27,829 --> 03:26:30,139
We actually get to see it on stream.

1291
03:26:30,139 --> 03:26:31,500
We actually get to see it on stream.

1292
03:26:34,219 --> 03:26:37,100
It's like you pitch shifted me 10 to 20% lower.

1293
03:26:39,399 --> 03:26:40,760
Fucking Minecraft is so...

1294
03:26:41,319 --> 03:26:42,760
It's a revolutionary game.

1295
03:26:47,799 --> 03:26:49,719
Is this when I stood up and did the speech

1296
03:26:49,719 --> 03:26:54,360
about how I was moving to Vegas and talking about the community and everything

1297
03:26:54,360 --> 03:26:56,120
and I was even blown out by the music?

1298
03:26:56,120 --> 03:27:01,219
That's the one.

1299
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:03,700
Okay, I do remember this stream.

1300
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:10,780
This is called Kooky Germa Joke.

1301
03:27:26,629 --> 03:27:27,129
Did it work?

1302
03:27:41,510 --> 03:27:42,709
That's wicked fucked up.

1303
03:27:47,879 --> 03:27:49,079
That's so fucked up.

1304
03:27:53,479 --> 03:27:55,159
What TV show is this from?

1305
03:27:56,469 --> 03:27:58,229
What TV show is this?

1306
03:28:03,479 --> 03:28:04,600
Is this Scooby Doo?

1307
03:28:05,739 --> 03:28:06,620
Oh my god.

1308
03:28:07,180 --> 03:28:18,010
How would you even find this to match this up?

1309
03:28:20,340 --> 03:28:21,139
Holy fuck.

1310
03:28:25,049 --> 03:28:26,090
Oh my god.

1311
03:28:26,729 --> 03:28:27,850
That's the worst.

1312
03:28:27,850 --> 03:28:29,450
That's the best noise I've ever made.

1313
03:28:29,450 --> 03:28:31,209
Did that win best noise last year?

1314
03:28:31,209 --> 03:28:31,850
It better have.

1315
03:28:38,309 --> 03:28:39,590
No, unbelievable.

1316
03:28:39,590 --> 03:28:42,069
This is called Germa Fortnight Black Hole Meme.

1317
03:28:55,700 --> 03:28:56,200
No!

1318
03:29:02,250 --> 03:29:02,889
Am I supposed to be...

1319
03:29:02,889 --> 03:29:03,930
Who jumped in?

1320
03:29:03,930 --> 03:29:05,129
Oh my god!

1321
03:29:07,129 --> 03:29:08,170
It's a mermaid!

1322
03:29:08,170 --> 03:29:08,489
Please!

1323
03:29:08,489 --> 03:29:10,489
It's supposed to be a YouTube reaction.

1324
03:29:13,059 --> 03:29:13,700
I can't see.

1325
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:14,180
I can't see.

1326
03:29:19,670 --> 03:29:20,629
This is awesome.

1327
03:29:24,280 --> 03:29:29,739
No, no, no.

1328
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:36,379
I'm fucking crying.

1329
03:29:36,379 --> 03:29:37,420
God damn it.

1330
03:29:38,379 --> 03:29:40,459
You're killing me.

1331
03:29:40,459 --> 03:29:44,940
...serial, non-branded, Captain Crunch character that is Fortnite.

1332
03:29:48,139 --> 03:29:50,760
Get the off-brand Fortnite.

1333
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:51,639
This is not Fortnite.

1334
03:29:51,639 --> 03:29:52,280
Don't sue me.

1335
03:29:57,270 --> 03:29:59,110
Can they get it?

1336
03:29:59,670 --> 03:30:01,219
What is going on?

1337
03:30:02,889 --> 03:30:04,409
What is going on?

1338
03:30:05,450 --> 03:30:15,079
Fortnite is going on.

1339
03:30:15,079 --> 03:30:16,280
Love for Germa is not.

1340
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:19,659
Wait, hold on a minute.

1341
03:30:20,780 --> 03:30:23,030
What you guys need to understand is

1342
03:30:23,989 --> 03:30:24,870
the face came here.

1343
03:30:24,870 --> 03:30:25,270
This is...

1344
03:30:25,989 --> 03:30:27,219
What is this from?

1345
03:30:28,250 --> 03:30:29,049
This is...

1346
03:30:29,049 --> 03:30:30,649
What stream is this from?

1347
03:30:30,649 --> 03:30:35,799
It's from The Thing.

1348
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:38,219
That's from Darkwood.

1349
03:30:39,290 --> 03:30:43,610
This is reacting to scary fucking monsters trying to kill me on screen.

1350
03:30:44,680 --> 03:30:47,479
Why does this work as a YouTuber reacting to Fortnite?

1351
03:31:03,110 --> 03:31:03,610
No!

1352
03:31:13,260 --> 03:31:15,639
It's a mermaid!

1353
03:31:15,639 --> 03:31:16,139
Please!

1354
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:21,139
I can't see.

1355
03:31:21,139 --> 03:31:21,639
I can't see.

1356
03:31:22,340 --> 03:31:37,020
Oh no.

1357
03:31:43,159 --> 03:31:47,000
Like, super overreaction to everything.

1358
03:31:59,690 --> 03:32:00,190
No!

1359
03:32:06,899 --> 03:32:07,860
He jumped in!

1360
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:09,139
Oh my god!

1361
03:32:11,059 --> 03:32:12,180
It's a mermaid!

1362
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:12,680
Please!

1363
03:32:21,700 --> 03:32:23,059
He jumped in.

1364
03:32:29,750 --> 03:32:31,590
That is phenomenal.

1365
03:32:31,590 --> 03:32:32,469
It's so funny.

1366
03:32:35,899 --> 03:32:39,479
I can't see!

1367
03:32:39,479 --> 03:32:39,979
I can't see!

1368
03:32:40,680 --> 03:32:42,120
This is from Darkwood.

1369
03:32:42,120 --> 03:32:44,360
Like, I'm playing a terrifying fucking game.

1370
03:32:49,190 --> 03:32:52,790
Why is everybody, like, dancing?

1371
03:32:54,790 --> 03:32:55,590
You're killing me!

1372
03:32:56,149 --> 03:32:57,670
You're killing me!

1373
03:32:57,670 --> 03:32:59,110
You're killing me, Epic!

1374
03:32:59,110 --> 03:33:00,229
I need to know what it is!

1375
03:33:01,909 --> 03:33:02,950
What am I saying here?

1376
03:33:06,729 --> 03:33:07,450
You're killing me!

1377
03:33:17,110 --> 03:33:17,350
No...

1378
03:33:17,350 --> 03:33:18,149
Oh, non-Brit...

1379
03:33:18,149 --> 03:33:19,110
Right, from The Carnival.

1380
03:33:30,469 --> 03:33:31,590
You're killing me.

1381
03:33:32,149 --> 03:33:32,649
Okay.

1382
03:33:34,149 --> 03:33:35,020
Okay.

1383
03:33:35,719 --> 03:33:36,440
Let's keep going.

1384
03:33:36,440 --> 03:33:37,239
We gotta keep going.

1385
03:33:38,139 --> 03:33:39,659
We can't get stuck on one video.

1386
03:33:42,819 --> 03:33:43,780
Oh my god.

1387
03:33:45,049 --> 03:33:46,409
There's so much going on in this.

1388
03:33:49,459 --> 03:33:50,100
That was great.

1389
03:33:51,989 --> 03:33:52,709
This one's called

1390
03:33:52,709 --> 03:33:55,510
Jerma vs Jevil Quest for the Gamer License.

1391
03:33:56,069 --> 03:33:59,579
I'm going off-cam for this one.

1392
03:34:00,219 --> 03:34:01,899
Because, like, boogers are coming out of my fucking nose,

1393
03:34:01,899 --> 03:34:03,420
so I have to, like, wipe my nose.

1394
03:34:21,750 --> 03:34:23,639
Asshole.

1395
03:34:36,819 --> 03:34:37,319
Oh no!

1396
03:34:38,579 --> 03:34:39,079
Oh my god!

1397
03:34:42,649 --> 03:34:43,149
Oh!

1398
03:34:45,690 --> 03:34:46,190
Nice!

1399
03:34:47,209 --> 03:34:50,139
Not bad for someone who died of Pinwheel.

1400
03:34:50,950 --> 03:34:52,389
I beat Pin...

1401
03:34:52,389 --> 03:34:53,030
Whatever.

1402
03:34:53,030 --> 03:34:54,549
People are starting to believe them.

1403
03:34:54,549 --> 03:34:55,049
You know?

1404
03:34:55,670 --> 03:34:57,510
I've gone to, like, Reddit threads before.

1405
03:34:57,510 --> 03:34:57,909
I've talked to...

1406
03:34:57,909 --> 03:34:58,629
Have I talked about this?

1407
03:34:58,629 --> 03:34:59,670
I probably have, but I need to make it...

1408
03:34:59,670 --> 03:35:00,709
I've reiterated again.

1409
03:35:01,350 --> 03:35:01,829
Like, someone...

1410
03:35:01,829 --> 03:35:03,270
There'll be, like, a Reddit poster.

1411
03:35:03,270 --> 03:35:03,670
I'm just like,

1412
03:35:03,670 --> 03:35:04,629
What the fuck?

1413
03:35:05,670 --> 03:35:07,510
I can't even, like, defend myself.

1414
03:35:07,510 --> 03:35:08,870
How am I supposed to, like, defend...

1415
03:35:11,670 --> 03:35:12,170
Who?

1416
03:35:12,729 --> 03:35:13,530
Up in the smoke.

1417
03:35:47,579 --> 03:35:49,420
Why is Stream laughs?

1418
03:35:49,979 --> 03:35:53,399
Well, if two in the hand is worth one in the bush,

1419
03:35:54,200 --> 03:35:56,989
looks like this guy went shush.

1420
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:05,559
I thought the bits were a part of the video.

1421
03:36:07,479 --> 03:36:09,159
Ever heard of the stage tick tock?

1422
03:36:09,159 --> 03:36:09,659
No!

1423
03:36:13,069 --> 03:36:15,549
Uh, PhylacteryLich just gave 10,000 bits.

1424
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:20,600
Thanks for the 100 fucking dollars.

1425
03:36:22,479 --> 03:36:22,979
Again.

1426
03:36:23,620 --> 03:36:24,180
And you say,

1427
03:36:24,180 --> 03:36:26,500
Jerma, you absolutely have to do another green screen stream.

1428
03:36:26,500 --> 03:36:28,819
This community makes amazing fan videos.

1429
03:36:28,819 --> 03:36:30,420
Well, that's the plan in, like, two weeks.

1430
03:36:31,389 --> 03:36:32,510
In a few days,

1431
03:36:32,510 --> 03:36:35,790
there's gonna be another Discord channel to talk about things for me to do,

1432
03:36:35,790 --> 03:36:40,829
and we're gonna do another 100, 200 actions in front of the green screen again.

1433
03:36:43,520 --> 03:36:45,440
Green screen DLC for free.

1434
03:36:45,440 --> 03:36:48,290
That's the title of the stream.

1435
03:36:48,290 --> 03:36:49,229
Pretty good title.

1436
03:36:49,870 --> 03:36:52,590
I do not want to know about TikTok clock,

1437
03:36:52,590 --> 03:36:55,500
but I do want to know about up in smoke,

1438
03:36:55,500 --> 03:36:57,739
but Jerma forgets how to use fire magic.

1439
03:36:58,299 --> 03:37:03,139
But thank you PhylacteryLich for the 100 bucks.

1440
03:37:03,139 --> 03:37:03,639
Seriously.

1441
03:37:05,459 --> 03:37:07,350
I'm back.

1442
03:37:08,049 --> 03:37:08,549
I'm back.

1443
03:37:11,870 --> 03:37:14,989
Up in smoke, but Jerma forgets how to use fire magic.

1444
03:37:14,989 --> 03:37:17,549
So I think the thing,

1445
03:37:18,110 --> 03:37:20,739
so I think the thing about,

1446
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:24,100
um, I think eating, going on a diet,

1447
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:24,899
it's not a bad idea.

1448
03:37:24,899 --> 03:37:27,409
It's, oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

1449
03:37:27,969 --> 03:37:30,530
There is, wait till he lands, wait till he lands.

1450
03:37:31,250 --> 03:37:33,379
Okay, he landed.

1451
03:37:35,809 --> 03:37:36,850
Ooh, up in smoke!

1452
03:37:37,569 --> 03:37:39,700
No, there, there, I heard it.

1453
03:37:39,700 --> 03:37:40,500
I just heard it, I did.

1454
03:37:47,180 --> 03:38:23,280
Colonel Mustang.

1455
03:38:23,280 --> 03:38:23,920
It didn't work.

1456
03:38:27,180 --> 03:38:27,979
Oh, fuck me.

1457
03:38:27,979 --> 03:38:28,479
Goodbye.

1458
03:38:32,620 --> 03:38:35,579
Oh, a fucking Colonel Mustang for a full metal alchemist.

1459
03:38:35,579 --> 03:38:38,540
You can, I love that I'm going to practice outside the room

1460
03:38:38,540 --> 03:38:39,739
because I don't want you to see it on camera

1461
03:38:39,739 --> 03:38:40,620
because it's embarrassing.

1462
03:38:55,729 --> 03:38:56,229
Keep going.

1463
03:38:57,659 --> 03:38:59,500
This is Jerma walks a thousand miles.

1464
03:39:02,129 --> 03:39:03,809
Everybody watching the VOD right now.

1465
03:39:06,270 --> 03:39:07,229
It's about to be quiet,

1466
03:39:07,229 --> 03:39:09,950
probably because this is looks like it's probably a full song.

1467
03:39:11,620 --> 03:39:16,139
Um, VOD, sorry guys.

1468
03:39:17,180 --> 03:39:18,299
You'll be back really soon.

1469
03:39:18,940 --> 03:39:23,180
You'll be back in exactly four minutes.

1470
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:40,670
Making my way downtown, walking fast.

1471
03:39:40,670 --> 03:39:45,629
Face this path and I'm homebound.

1472
03:39:45,629 --> 03:39:59,299
Yeah, just making my way, making my way through the crowd.

1473
03:39:59,299 --> 03:40:06,270
And I need you, and I miss you, and now I want.

1474
03:40:07,940 --> 03:40:17,790
If I could fall into the sky, do you think time went past me by?

1475
03:40:17,790 --> 03:40:28,879
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.

1476
03:40:28,879 --> 03:40:38,700
I'm gonna think of you and wonder if you ever think of me.

1477
03:40:38,700 --> 03:40:39,819
This is the whole song.

1478
03:40:40,379 --> 03:40:41,579
This is really well done.

1479
03:40:42,860 --> 03:40:47,739
Wrong way.

1480
03:40:48,219 --> 03:40:51,579
20 more community subs from Shazzo IP.

1481
03:40:51,579 --> 03:40:52,700
Thank you so much.

1482
03:40:52,700 --> 03:40:53,659
40 on the night.

1483
03:40:54,379 --> 03:41:03,379
Cause I need you, and I miss you, and now I want.

1484
03:41:03,379 --> 03:41:12,420
If I could fall into the sky, do you think time went past me by?

1485
03:41:12,420 --> 03:41:24,540
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.

1486
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:27,309
There's more song.

1487
03:41:27,870 --> 03:41:28,909
How long is this song?

1488
03:41:29,709 --> 03:41:31,579
Does this song end here?

1489
03:41:32,459 --> 03:41:38,690
Here come the emotes.

1490
03:41:39,489 --> 03:41:52,430
Rich.

1491
03:41:52,430 --> 03:41:52,989
Oh, right.

1492
03:41:54,030 --> 03:41:55,549
Making my way downtown.

1493
03:41:55,549 --> 03:41:57,059
I'm fast.

1494
03:41:57,059 --> 03:42:01,059
Face this path and I'm homebound.

1495
03:42:01,059 --> 03:42:02,579
I'm gonna get sued by...

1496
03:42:02,579 --> 03:42:02,819
What?

1497
03:42:02,819 --> 03:42:03,379
What's her name?

1498
03:42:04,340 --> 03:42:05,540
Melissa McCarthy?

1499
03:42:05,540 --> 03:42:06,100
What's her name?

1500
03:42:06,100 --> 03:42:07,700
Making my way, making my way through the crowd.

1501
03:42:07,700 --> 03:42:08,420
Who made this song?

1502
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:14,219
Vanessa Carlin.

1503
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:15,420
What?

1504
03:42:15,420 --> 03:42:16,780
Melissa McCarthy?

1505
03:42:16,780 --> 03:42:29,420
Cause I still miss you, and now I could fall into the sky.

1506
03:42:30,590 --> 03:42:35,389
Do you think time would pass us by?

1507
03:42:35,389 --> 03:42:42,590
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.

1508
03:42:42,590 --> 03:42:48,100
So what if I like fuck up the VOD?

1509
03:42:48,100 --> 03:42:50,819
Can I like talk over this and make it so that it doesn't get claimed?

1510
03:42:50,819 --> 03:42:52,260
Do you think time would pass me by?

1511
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:53,819
Like what if I just start going like...

1512
03:42:53,819 --> 03:43:20,420
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I see you tonight.

1513
03:43:20,420 --> 03:43:21,620
Half Life 2 Zombie.

1514
03:43:22,420 --> 03:43:27,379
That was gonna work, trust me.

1515
03:43:30,129 --> 03:43:31,010
I can't even do that again.

1516
03:43:34,579 --> 03:43:37,059
Yes, I can.

1517
03:43:37,059 --> 03:43:38,579
I'm fucking so good at it.

1518
03:43:39,139 --> 03:43:47,629
It's the worst sound, best sound.

1519
03:43:47,629 --> 03:43:48,590
Make up your mind!

1520
03:43:50,700 --> 03:43:55,340
I have to sit here for a second cause if the VOD gets muted, it's gonna mute like another minute.

1521
03:43:56,139 --> 03:43:59,440
So we have to wait.

1522
03:43:59,440 --> 03:44:01,040
I'm looking after you, VOD.

1523
03:44:01,040 --> 03:44:02,239
This is for the VOD watchers.

1524
03:44:03,549 --> 03:44:04,670
Can I write this down so I can...

1525
03:44:04,670 --> 03:44:05,629
I need to communicate with them.

1526
03:44:11,819 --> 03:44:13,500
Here, I'll write unmuted soon.

1527
03:44:14,059 --> 03:44:15,569
I need to be able to commit...

1528
03:44:15,569 --> 03:44:16,049
Wait, don't...

1529
03:44:16,049 --> 03:44:16,530
Wait, don't go!

1530
03:44:16,530 --> 03:44:25,809
Don't move, don't go anywhere.

1531
03:44:25,809 --> 03:44:28,799
My hand is so sweaty.

1532
03:44:28,799 --> 03:44:38,270
I can't even write with permanent marker on it.

1533
03:44:38,270 --> 03:44:38,510
Here.

1534
03:44:40,260 --> 03:44:41,219
Unmuted soon.

1535
03:44:44,930 --> 03:44:45,250
Soon.

1536
03:44:48,819 --> 03:44:50,340
People thought I was making that shit up.

1537
03:44:50,340 --> 03:44:51,780
You wanna see something?

1538
03:44:51,780 --> 03:44:55,700
He's lying about how he's like fucking 200 degrees fucking Celsius.

1539
03:44:55,700 --> 03:44:56,180
Oh yeah?

1540
03:44:56,899 --> 03:45:01,069
This is permanent marker.

1541
03:45:06,860 --> 03:45:07,340
I just...

1542
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:08,780
I melt shit when I touch it.

1543
03:45:14,540 --> 03:45:14,940
You saw...

1544
03:45:14,940 --> 03:45:15,579
It's a Sharpie.

1545
03:45:15,579 --> 03:45:16,540
This shit's...

1546
03:45:16,540 --> 03:45:17,819
This is forever.

1547
03:45:17,819 --> 03:45:25,360
That's such a shitty superpower.

1548
03:45:25,360 --> 03:45:28,500
Hey, do you guys remember the writing that was on my hand?

1549
03:45:30,819 --> 03:45:31,620
Who was here for that?

1550
03:45:32,739 --> 03:45:33,940
30 to 40 seconds ago.

1551
03:45:33,940 --> 03:45:34,579
Who was here for that?

1552
03:45:34,579 --> 03:45:35,219
Were you here for that?

1553
03:45:35,780 --> 03:45:46,530
Who was here for that?

1554
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:47,969
Why am I on Reddit?

1555
03:45:51,729 --> 03:45:52,290
No, love that.

1556
03:45:52,290 --> 03:45:56,979
This is wrong thing.

1557
03:45:56,979 --> 03:45:59,219
Oh, that's the last thing we looked at on the image side.

1558
03:45:59,219 --> 03:45:59,459
Right.

1559
03:45:59,459 --> 03:45:59,780
Okay.

1560
03:46:01,299 --> 03:46:01,780
Let's go!

1561
03:46:08,049 --> 03:46:09,729
This one's called Sick Bass Drop.

1562
03:46:10,049 --> 03:46:49,579
I feel like if you did that, if somebody really did that, I think people would think it was

1563
03:46:49,579 --> 03:46:50,379
fucking awesome.

1564
03:46:51,020 --> 03:46:52,139
You don't think you would too?

1565
03:46:52,940 --> 03:46:53,500
It'd be so...

1566
03:46:53,500 --> 03:46:54,940
You'd be like, holy shit, this is...

1567
03:46:55,739 --> 03:46:57,969
What is this?

1568
03:46:58,690 --> 03:47:04,540
This is so different and new age.

1569
03:47:05,840 --> 03:47:06,479
They're drunk.

1570
03:47:08,639 --> 03:47:10,000
So that's even better.

1571
03:47:10,000 --> 03:47:11,219
They could like...

1572
03:47:11,219 --> 03:47:13,540
It'll be like, wow, this is the best song I've ever heard!

1573
03:47:14,340 --> 03:47:16,579
And then I'll get $500,000 in royalties.

1574
03:47:17,219 --> 03:47:20,690
This is German versus Obi-Wan and Anakin.

1575
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:27,420
Hey, what's up, uh...

1576
03:47:27,420 --> 03:47:28,979
Is this Vinny?

1577
03:47:28,979 --> 03:47:29,540
Is this Vinny?

1578
03:47:29,540 --> 03:47:30,420
Is this Vinesauce?

1579
03:47:31,139 --> 03:47:33,860
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1580
03:47:34,659 --> 03:47:36,020
Wait, wait, what?

1581
03:47:36,979 --> 03:47:38,180
This is spoilers?

1582
03:47:38,500 --> 03:47:39,059
Okay, fine.

1583
03:47:39,059 --> 03:47:44,479
Spoilers for Star Wars the prequels that you're gonna skip anyways because you're not gonna

1584
03:47:44,479 --> 03:47:46,319
watch the prequels because people hate them for some reason.

1585
03:47:46,319 --> 03:47:47,120
I like the prequels.

1586
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:47,840
What's wrong with them?

1587
03:47:57,309 --> 03:48:03,090
There's a lot wrong with the prequels, but come on, Yoda has the lightsaber?

1588
03:48:03,090 --> 03:48:03,649
Pog.

1589
03:48:14,290 --> 03:48:16,930
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1590
03:48:17,569 --> 03:48:18,530
We'll take them together.

1591
03:48:18,770 --> 03:48:19,889
You're going slowly on the left.

1592
03:48:19,889 --> 03:48:20,530
I'm taking it now!

1593
03:48:20,530 --> 03:48:21,409
No, Anakin, no!

1594
03:48:22,049 --> 03:48:22,290
No!

1595
03:48:22,290 --> 03:48:23,729
Get the fuck out of here!

1596
03:48:23,729 --> 03:48:28,450
How dare you come into my dream and humiliate me in front of my 60,000 fucking viewers!

1597
03:48:28,450 --> 03:48:30,129
I'll bring you toilet water.

1598
03:48:30,129 --> 03:48:32,370
I'll bring you toilet water.

1599
03:48:32,370 --> 03:48:35,420
Problems with toilet?

1600
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:41,860
Think so.

1601
03:49:01,020 --> 03:49:07,090
What's up, man?

1602
03:49:07,809 --> 03:49:10,700
One more time.

1603
03:49:10,700 --> 03:49:13,940
Hey, what's up?

1604
03:49:13,940 --> 03:49:15,059
What's up, uh...

1605
03:49:15,059 --> 03:49:16,739
Is this Vinny?

1606
03:49:16,819 --> 03:49:17,299
Is this Vinny?

1607
03:49:17,299 --> 03:49:18,180
Is this Vinesauce?

1608
03:49:18,899 --> 03:49:21,620
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1609
03:49:22,659 --> 03:49:23,620
That's Mace...

1610
03:49:23,620 --> 03:49:25,780
That's Mace Windu talking!

1611
03:49:25,780 --> 03:49:26,979
Is that Mace Windu?

1612
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:29,020
Listen.

1613
03:49:29,020 --> 03:49:29,979
I'm taking it now!

1614
03:49:29,979 --> 03:49:30,459
No, Anakin!

1615
03:49:30,459 --> 03:49:31,420
We'll take them together.

1616
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:32,559
We're going slowly on the left.

1617
03:49:32,559 --> 03:49:33,200
I'm taking it now!

1618
03:49:33,200 --> 03:49:34,879
You killed today, Jeremy.

1619
03:49:34,879 --> 03:49:36,559
Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1620
03:49:38,739 --> 03:49:39,459
That's Vinny?

1621
03:49:40,020 --> 03:49:40,959
No, it's not!

1622
03:49:40,959 --> 03:49:42,879
That's the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1623
03:49:44,540 --> 03:49:46,379
No, that's Mace Windu!

1624
03:49:51,329 --> 03:49:52,610
That's not...

1625
03:49:52,610 --> 03:49:53,969
Is it actually Vinny?

1626
03:49:54,690 --> 03:49:55,489
Listen closely.

1627
03:49:55,489 --> 03:49:57,649
For all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1628
03:50:02,670 --> 03:50:03,549
Is this Vinny?

1629
03:50:03,549 --> 03:50:04,110
Is this Vinny?

1630
03:50:04,110 --> 03:50:04,909
Is this Vinesauce?

1631
03:50:05,709 --> 03:50:08,909
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Jeremy.

1632
03:50:08,909 --> 03:50:09,950
We'll take them together.

1633
03:50:09,950 --> 03:50:11,069
You're going slowly on the left.

1634
03:50:11,069 --> 03:50:11,709
I'm taking it now!

1635
03:50:11,709 --> 03:50:12,350
No, Anakin!

1636
03:50:12,350 --> 03:50:12,590
No!

1637
03:50:13,229 --> 03:50:13,469
No!

1638
03:50:13,469 --> 03:50:14,909
Get the fuck out of here!

1639
03:50:14,909 --> 03:50:16,430
How dare you come into my crew!

1640
03:50:16,430 --> 03:50:19,629
You humiliate me in front of my 60,000 fucking viewers!

1641
03:50:19,629 --> 03:50:20,829
I'll bring you toilet water.

1642
03:50:21,629 --> 03:50:22,909
I'll bring you toilet water.

1643
03:50:22,909 --> 03:50:25,309
The backhand is the best thing ever.

1644
03:50:25,309 --> 03:50:26,110
Problem with the toilet?

1645
03:50:27,629 --> 03:50:33,020
Think so.

1646
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:47,170
That's what you sound like.

1647
03:50:54,559 --> 03:51:00,190
Imagine you had the time to backhand somebody in a lightsaber fight like that.

1648
03:51:01,469 --> 03:51:02,350
Ay, ay, ay.

1649
03:51:02,350 --> 03:51:03,950
That was fucking funny.

1650
03:51:03,950 --> 03:51:07,549
This is called Jerma Awu.

1651
03:51:12,450 --> 03:51:13,489
Why is this called Awu?

1652
03:51:16,500 --> 03:51:17,940
What brings you out this far?

1653
03:51:31,520 --> 03:51:32,719
What is going on?

1654
03:51:33,680 --> 03:51:34,559
What is going on?

1655
03:51:36,159 --> 03:51:42,000
Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time.

1656
03:51:42,000 --> 03:51:43,920
I thought it was part of the script.

1657
03:51:43,920 --> 03:51:45,120
I think my uncle knows him.

1658
03:51:45,920 --> 03:51:48,239
I'm just playing Star Wars.

1659
03:51:48,239 --> 03:51:48,879
What?

1660
03:51:48,879 --> 03:51:49,440
Not yet.

1661
03:51:50,559 --> 03:51:51,200
You know it.

1662
03:51:51,200 --> 03:51:52,829
Of course I know it.

1663
03:51:53,389 --> 03:51:54,180
It's me.

1664
03:51:58,110 --> 03:52:00,030
I didn't know auto play was going.

1665
03:52:02,579 --> 03:52:06,260
I was trying to figure out what the fuck was going on in this video.

1666
03:52:15,440 --> 03:52:16,639
Turn off auto play?

1667
03:52:16,639 --> 03:52:17,120
I know!

1668
03:52:25,180 --> 03:52:27,579
Well, look, let me give some defense here.

1669
03:52:27,579 --> 03:52:29,420
We just watched like a Star Wars one.

1670
03:52:29,420 --> 03:52:32,540
I don't know if that was maybe the same person that made the video

1671
03:52:32,540 --> 03:52:33,979
or if it was like a group of friends.

1672
03:52:33,979 --> 03:52:36,700
They were like, hey, let's make like Star Wars shit in our videos.

1673
03:52:36,700 --> 03:52:37,260
I don't know.

1674
03:52:38,299 --> 03:52:44,639
That's a weak defense.

1675
03:52:44,639 --> 03:52:45,680
That's Jerma Awu.

1676
03:52:46,399 --> 03:52:48,799
This is also called Jerma Jump Scare.

1677
03:52:48,959 --> 03:52:49,600
What was that?

1678
03:52:55,149 --> 03:52:57,229
This is the same thing.

1679
03:53:24,340 --> 03:53:25,459
Oh my God.

1680
03:53:26,340 --> 03:53:33,059
This is called Jerma Bars.

1681
03:53:33,940 --> 03:53:34,659
Jerma Bars.

1682
03:53:34,659 --> 03:53:37,459
Previously on Jerma Community Night a month or so ago.

1683
03:53:37,459 --> 03:53:40,420
It's like when you get to a certain point when you sing

1684
03:53:40,979 --> 03:53:45,620
and you hit the absolute, I cannot do this, but I'm going to try anyways.

1685
03:53:45,620 --> 03:53:49,540
That's how you get like the like, now I know.

1686
03:53:49,780 --> 03:53:52,030
My A.

1687
03:53:52,030 --> 03:53:53,629
You can't like go any higher.

1688
03:53:56,270 --> 03:53:56,510
No.

1689
03:53:57,389 --> 03:54:01,540
Fucking Souls games.

1690
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:04,799
When in doubt, radish it out.

1691
03:54:05,360 --> 03:54:19,899
Sounds like a snare.

1692
03:54:27,469 --> 03:54:29,549
One, two, three.

1693
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:48,719
You know the drill.

1694
03:54:48,719 --> 03:54:49,680
Yep, we do.

1695
03:54:50,239 --> 03:54:57,680
We do.

1696
03:55:12,340 --> 03:55:34,079
Oh my fucking God.

1697
03:56:08,959 --> 03:57:13,979
Oh, that was a fucking awesome link, link, link, link, link.

1698
03:57:14,540 --> 03:57:15,020
Oh yeah.

1699
03:57:15,819 --> 03:57:16,540
I'll give you a link.

1700
03:57:17,100 --> 03:57:26,020
There you are.

1701
03:57:26,020 --> 03:57:26,739
Uh, moving on.

1702
03:57:27,459 --> 03:57:31,729
We've got, we've got, we still have a nice chunk of stuff to see.

1703
03:57:36,690 --> 03:57:40,610
This one is called Fireman First Day in the Park.

1704
03:57:41,250 --> 03:57:43,840
A Jerma985 animation.

1705
03:57:56,719 --> 03:57:57,680
First Day in the Park.

1706
03:57:58,639 --> 03:58:12,860
Animation by Kit Cekat.

1707
03:58:21,889 --> 03:58:29,409
Where are you going, Fireman?

1708
03:58:30,129 --> 03:58:37,520
I feel like this could be on like Sesame Street.

1709
03:58:37,520 --> 03:58:46,299
Never mind.

1710
03:59:08,379 --> 03:59:09,420
No, don't go in the water.

1711
03:59:10,430 --> 03:59:10,750
No.

1712
03:59:11,629 --> 03:59:29,739
He's all right.

1713
03:59:29,739 --> 03:59:30,940
That was cute.

1714
03:59:30,940 --> 03:59:32,459
Fireman's First Day in the Park.

1715
03:59:33,739 --> 03:59:35,180
You can come back out.

1716
03:59:35,180 --> 03:59:35,579
We'll just...

1717
03:59:46,110 --> 03:59:47,469
What is going on?

1718
03:59:47,469 --> 03:59:57,899
Is he all right?

1719
03:59:58,459 --> 04:00:09,020
What the fuck?

1720
04:00:09,020 --> 04:00:09,579
Crash it.

1721
04:00:12,379 --> 04:00:13,500
Why so many cars?

1722
04:00:15,100 --> 04:00:26,430
Holy shit.

1723
04:00:27,549 --> 04:00:28,430
Oh, snake.

1724
04:00:29,549 --> 04:00:33,139
The snake.

1725
04:00:33,139 --> 04:00:33,700
Otherwise.

1726
04:00:34,500 --> 04:00:37,170
There goes otherwise.

1727
04:00:39,200 --> 04:00:39,840
See, he's okay.

1728
04:00:39,840 --> 04:00:40,239
He's fine.

1729
04:00:43,389 --> 04:00:44,909
That was really just cute.

1730
04:00:46,030 --> 04:00:48,829
Except for the part where the whole thing burnt down.

1731
04:00:48,829 --> 04:00:50,750
And then there were 10 car crashes.

1732
04:00:51,309 --> 04:00:55,459
It's not the real Fireman.

1733
04:00:58,739 --> 04:00:59,860
You mean the whole video.

1734
04:01:02,420 --> 04:01:03,299
No, that was awesome.

1735
04:01:05,709 --> 04:01:09,309
This is called Source Filmmaker Bill Crazy, featuring Gary the Fuck Up.

1736
04:01:09,870 --> 04:01:16,500
Hey, what's going on, crazy fires?

1737
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:19,540
It's me, Crazy Bill Crazy.

1738
04:01:19,540 --> 04:01:21,780
I'm here with another video, hit with always.

1739
04:01:21,780 --> 04:01:22,899
Gary the Fuck Up.

1740
04:01:22,899 --> 04:01:24,180
That's me, Gary the Fuck Up.

1741
04:01:24,180 --> 04:01:28,260
And today, as you see, I'm sitting in a pool of water.

1742
04:01:28,260 --> 04:01:28,819
Water?

1743
04:01:28,819 --> 04:01:29,940
And with water in it.

1744
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:31,299
That's right, motherfucker.

1745
04:01:31,299 --> 04:01:35,940
And what's going to happen here today, Gary is going to drop a toaster in here.

1746
04:01:35,940 --> 04:01:36,420
That's right.

1747
04:01:36,420 --> 04:01:38,020
I'm going to see how long I can last.

1748
04:01:38,020 --> 04:01:39,700
It's going to hurt like a bitch.

1749
04:01:39,700 --> 04:01:40,819
You know what I mean?

1750
04:01:40,819 --> 04:01:41,379
Can't wait.

1751
04:01:41,379 --> 04:01:42,819
It's going to scare me.

1752
04:01:42,819 --> 04:01:43,459
Yeah.

1753
04:01:43,459 --> 04:01:44,659
Gary, I'm ready.

1754
04:01:44,659 --> 04:01:45,139
You ready?

1755
04:01:45,139 --> 04:01:45,780
Throw it in there.

1756
04:01:45,780 --> 04:01:46,260
You ready?

1757
04:01:46,260 --> 04:01:47,780
Make sure you like this video.

1758
04:01:47,780 --> 04:01:48,260
Get ready.

1759
04:01:50,260 --> 04:01:51,940
Wow, that was...

1760
04:01:53,549 --> 04:01:54,590
That was crazy.

1761
04:01:59,840 --> 04:02:02,610
Hey, what's...

1762
04:02:20,500 --> 04:02:21,700
Gary, I'm ready.

1763
04:02:21,700 --> 04:02:22,180
You ready?

1764
04:02:22,180 --> 04:02:22,739
Throw it in there.

1765
04:02:22,739 --> 04:02:23,299
You ready?

1766
04:02:23,299 --> 04:02:24,739
Make sure you like this video.

1767
04:02:29,340 --> 04:02:30,299
Gary the Fuck Up.

1768
04:02:31,819 --> 04:02:32,459
That was great.

1769
04:02:35,229 --> 04:02:38,510
And then the clown just kind of shows up here.

1770
04:02:39,149 --> 04:02:39,870
Wow, that was...

1771
04:02:41,469 --> 04:02:42,510
That was crazy.

1772
04:02:43,309 --> 04:02:45,780
What's this clown?

1773
04:02:46,340 --> 04:02:49,059
Good animation, good stuff.

1774
04:02:49,059 --> 04:02:49,860
There's a link.

1775
04:02:49,860 --> 04:02:50,659
You got it.

1776
04:02:50,659 --> 04:03:00,510
Let's keep going.

1777
04:03:00,510 --> 04:03:28,540
This next one is called SCP-985.

1778
04:03:28,540 --> 04:03:29,040
That's it.

1779
04:03:31,950 --> 04:03:33,149
The Elmo at the end.

1780
04:03:41,010 --> 04:03:43,790
Short, sweet, and it was really good.

1781
04:03:45,409 --> 04:03:46,129
Way to go.

1782
04:03:46,129 --> 04:03:50,559
Uh, I don't know.

1783
04:03:50,559 --> 04:03:52,319
This is called the third rat song.

1784
04:03:52,319 --> 04:03:52,819
Kinda.

1785
04:03:53,520 --> 04:03:54,020
Kinda.

1786
04:04:23,629 --> 04:04:40,940
There's the real image of my face.

1787
04:04:42,510 --> 04:04:43,790
That was really, really, really good.

1788
04:04:44,590 --> 04:04:46,620
Third rat song, kinda.

1789
04:04:50,860 --> 04:04:52,620
Yeah, that face will be an emote.

1790
04:04:52,620 --> 04:04:53,739
I will make it an emote.

1791
04:04:53,739 --> 04:04:54,239
I promise.

1792
04:04:54,860 --> 04:04:56,190
This is hard to see.

1793
04:04:57,950 --> 04:04:59,709
Why is this community so good at making music?

1794
04:05:00,510 --> 04:05:03,229
The better question is why is this community so good at making everything?

1795
04:05:03,870 --> 04:05:09,520
You want a link for this one too?

1796
04:05:09,520 --> 04:05:10,399
Sure thing.

1797
04:05:10,399 --> 04:05:21,340
Coming up next.

1798
04:05:24,459 --> 04:05:24,940
We have...

1799
04:05:24,940 --> 04:05:26,540
This is called German 985.

1800
04:05:28,059 --> 04:05:29,819
Fandango movie clips.

1801
04:05:29,819 --> 04:05:32,219
Green screen movie scene, one out of one.

1802
04:05:56,379 --> 04:05:58,700
Yes, I knew what it was gonna be.

1803
04:05:59,260 --> 04:05:59,899
I knew it.

1804
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:19,979
It's so funny.

1805
04:06:19,979 --> 04:06:23,309
Cause like, seriously, sometimes you do like a Fandango movie clip.

1806
04:06:23,309 --> 04:06:25,629
It's like eight seconds long.

1807
04:06:26,430 --> 04:06:30,770
Why does it have to be this much time spent on all the stuff at the end?

1808
04:06:31,489 --> 04:06:34,850
You nailed it.

1809
04:06:34,850 --> 04:06:36,530
You fucking nailed it.

1810
04:06:37,569 --> 04:06:53,389
It's so good.

1811
04:07:02,500 --> 04:07:03,860
Steven Spielberg.

1812
04:07:04,739 --> 04:07:11,149
Okay, question.

1813
04:07:12,129 --> 04:07:13,729
What the hell is Fandango?

1814
04:07:15,170 --> 04:07:16,610
Why do they have all this stuff at the end?

1815
04:07:17,250 --> 04:07:21,100
I don't even know what this is selling me.

1816
04:07:21,100 --> 04:07:22,139
Is it a product?

1817
04:07:22,780 --> 04:07:24,610
Is it movie tickets?

1818
04:07:28,190 --> 04:07:29,229
It's a ticket seller.

1819
04:07:29,229 --> 04:07:30,430
So what's this like...

1820
04:07:30,430 --> 04:07:31,870
What's all this other stuff at the end here?

1821
04:07:33,250 --> 04:07:36,450
Do you go to Fandango and click on like I'm in an excited mood

1822
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:38,850
and they recommend tickets for shows?

1823
04:07:44,719 --> 04:07:45,040
Yes.

1824
04:07:47,620 --> 04:07:48,659
Why would you ever do that?

1825
04:07:49,219 --> 04:07:55,840
There were like 10 to 15 movies in the theater at any given moment.

1826
04:07:55,840 --> 04:07:58,559
There's like two or three movies per genre for you to see.

1827
04:08:01,940 --> 04:08:05,899
It's not that hard.

1828
04:08:05,899 --> 04:08:06,860
Sometimes, yeah, less than that.

1829
04:08:06,860 --> 04:08:08,780
Like eight in the theater.

1830
04:08:08,780 --> 04:08:10,860
What's with the...

1831
04:08:10,860 --> 04:08:11,739
Ah, I don't know.

1832
04:08:11,739 --> 04:08:12,860
People screaming.

1833
04:08:12,860 --> 04:08:16,180
People were just screaming.

1834
04:08:16,180 --> 04:08:16,420
I don't know.

1835
04:08:16,420 --> 04:08:17,540
People just scream in this chat.

1836
04:08:18,479 --> 04:08:19,120
You guys know that.

1837
04:08:19,120 --> 04:08:20,159
You've been around a long time.

1838
04:08:21,889 --> 04:08:26,110
Why was I saying, ah, yeah, that is you.

1839
04:08:26,110 --> 04:08:27,309
That is actually you.

1840
04:08:27,309 --> 04:08:27,709
You're right.

1841
04:08:29,920 --> 04:08:30,399
Yeah, that's...

1842
04:08:33,540 --> 04:08:34,659
Yeah, that's you.

1843
04:08:34,659 --> 04:08:35,139
That is you.

1844
04:08:36,530 --> 04:08:38,530
All one, two, three, four, five...

1845
04:08:38,530 --> 04:08:39,250
All five of you here.

1846
04:08:39,250 --> 04:08:43,020
What were you doing?

1847
04:08:43,020 --> 04:08:43,899
I wonder.

1848
04:08:43,899 --> 04:08:49,819
That was fantastic though.

1849
04:08:51,780 --> 04:08:53,059
I want to link this one because like...

1850
04:08:54,850 --> 04:08:57,090
This is very, very, very, very creative.

1851
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:04,639
Bingo.

1852
04:09:04,639 --> 04:09:06,139
All right.

1853
04:09:06,139 --> 04:09:09,979
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1854
04:09:09,979 --> 04:09:14,340
There are ten more videos to watch.

1855
04:09:14,340 --> 04:09:22,180
This is called Las Vegas Noir.

1856
04:09:25,979 --> 04:09:40,059
Side comment?

1857
04:09:53,100 --> 04:09:54,379
Las Vegas Noir.

1858
04:09:59,120 --> 04:10:01,629
Captain, we were on our way to interview...

1859
04:10:02,670 --> 04:10:03,549
Yes, folks, I know.

1860
04:10:04,879 --> 04:10:07,280
This particular fiend is an old acquaintance.

1861
04:10:08,239 --> 04:10:11,440
I have tried to reaffirm his belief in a wrathful and terrible god.

1862
04:10:12,479 --> 04:10:16,420
Whichever way it goes, he did it in reverse.

1863
04:10:21,200 --> 04:10:22,399
You look like you've had it rough.

1864
04:10:33,979 --> 04:10:37,899
You're maybe five, five, five, six tops.

1865
04:10:37,899 --> 04:10:39,340
And you wear size 11s?

1866
04:10:39,340 --> 04:10:40,139
I don't think so.

1867
04:10:41,920 --> 04:10:45,280
You have no job and nowhere to live by the smell of things.

1868
04:10:45,840 --> 04:10:46,719
And you need money.

1869
04:10:46,719 --> 04:10:49,440
Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.

1870
04:10:52,190 --> 04:10:53,870
You disappoint me, Cole, folks.

1871
04:10:55,280 --> 04:10:57,360
Get back in there and make some lunch, boy.

1872
04:10:57,360 --> 04:10:58,399
I need a confession.

1873
04:10:59,440 --> 04:11:01,889
Hey, hey, whoa.

1874
04:11:02,690 --> 04:11:03,489
Why'd you do that?

1875
04:11:15,200 --> 04:11:16,079
Why did he just do that?

1876
04:11:16,799 --> 04:11:19,649
And you need money.

1877
04:11:19,729 --> 04:11:22,370
Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.

1878
04:11:25,180 --> 04:11:26,780
You disappoint me, Cole, folks.

1879
04:11:28,219 --> 04:11:30,299
Get back in there and make some lunch, boy.

1880
04:11:30,299 --> 04:11:31,340
I need a confession.

1881
04:11:35,280 --> 04:11:37,280
You can do this in L.A. Noir?

1882
04:11:37,920 --> 04:11:43,540
I didn't know you could, like, ragdoll off a building.

1883
04:11:48,030 --> 04:11:48,829
Holy shit.

1884
04:11:49,469 --> 04:11:59,260
This one's called German 95, 2019, HD trailer.

1885
04:11:59,260 --> 04:12:06,719
And it says, joker, parody.

1886
04:12:06,719 --> 04:12:08,319
Does it help to have someone to talk to?

1887
04:12:16,829 --> 04:12:21,780
You know, my mother always told me.

1888
04:12:36,479 --> 04:12:41,469
Deal is not on the table anymore.

1889
04:12:42,270 --> 04:12:43,870
I don't know what to do with this stuff.

1890
04:12:43,870 --> 04:12:45,069
Is this what you fucking wanted?

1891
04:12:45,790 --> 04:12:46,670
You wanted this shit?

1892
04:12:53,379 --> 04:12:54,659
Spider-Man.

1893
04:12:54,659 --> 04:12:55,059
Hold on.

1894
04:12:55,059 --> 04:12:55,940
I want to see this again.

1895
04:12:56,739 --> 04:12:58,260
Does it help to have someone to talk to?

1896
04:13:10,139 --> 04:13:11,579
You know, my mother always told me.

1897
04:13:13,979 --> 04:13:15,219
Be a good boy.

1898
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:29,120
By the way, Spider-Man.

1899
04:13:29,120 --> 04:13:31,360
Deal is not on the table anymore.

1900
04:13:32,159 --> 04:13:33,760
I don't know what to do with this stuff.

1901
04:13:33,760 --> 04:13:34,959
Is this what you fucking wanted?

1902
04:13:39,340 --> 04:13:41,979
The age of just deep fakes.

1903
04:13:41,979 --> 04:13:43,500
You could deep fake anything on anyone.

1904
04:13:44,700 --> 04:13:47,420
Deep fake a costume on somebody.

1905
04:13:47,420 --> 04:13:48,940
You don't have to go for Halloween anymore.

1906
04:13:49,500 --> 04:13:52,219
You can just pretend you did a bunch of cool shit.

1907
04:13:52,219 --> 04:13:55,500
Just put on a cool, just have a computer costume on.

1908
04:13:55,500 --> 04:14:01,260
That's a Snapchat filter.

1909
04:14:10,620 --> 04:14:13,979
Still, you don't have to do anything anymore.

1910
04:14:13,979 --> 04:14:17,649
You just have to put a Snapchat filter on

1911
04:14:17,649 --> 04:14:20,290
and then put a fake beach behind you.

1912
04:14:24,159 --> 04:14:26,219
It's the same thing.

1913
04:14:26,219 --> 04:14:28,139
We only use Instagram stories here.

1914
04:14:32,239 --> 04:14:33,200
You want a link to this one?

1915
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:36,100
I'll give you a link to this one.

1916
04:14:36,100 --> 04:14:40,450
Someone said, why did you turn the face cam off?

1917
04:14:40,450 --> 04:14:42,370
Because I got really sweaty.

1918
04:14:46,989 --> 04:14:47,950
I was laughing too hard.

1919
04:14:47,950 --> 04:14:48,909
Boogers were coming out of my nose

1920
04:14:48,909 --> 04:14:50,590
and I got really sweaty and smelly.

1921
04:14:51,229 --> 04:14:55,409
There you go.

1922
04:14:55,409 --> 04:14:55,969
All right.

1923
04:14:55,969 --> 04:14:57,649
Down to the last 10, I think.

1924
04:14:59,760 --> 04:15:01,280
This one's called Precious Germo.

1925
04:15:20,139 --> 04:15:21,260
Naked.

1926
04:15:32,139 --> 04:15:40,049
The eyes of a killer.

1927
04:15:47,729 --> 04:15:49,329
The eyes of Vaude ruined?

1928
04:15:50,590 --> 04:15:51,309
No, that's all right.

1929
04:15:54,379 --> 04:15:55,020
The Vaude's fine.

1930
04:15:55,020 --> 04:15:56,059
That was Precious Germo.

1931
04:15:56,059 --> 04:15:58,299
It was a lot of particle effects,

1932
04:15:58,299 --> 04:15:59,819
which are really, really cool.

1933
04:16:02,239 --> 04:16:04,079
This is called, can't think of a title for this.

1934
04:16:04,079 --> 04:16:05,280
It's a Germo meme.

1935
04:16:46,319 --> 04:16:47,760
Germo's Last Christmas.

1936
04:16:51,389 --> 04:16:52,030
Let it play.

1937
04:16:54,299 --> 04:16:55,340
Germo's Last Christmas.

1938
04:16:59,389 --> 04:17:02,620
I will light a motherfucker up right now.

1939
04:17:34,299 --> 04:17:37,899
I gotta go.

1940
04:17:37,899 --> 04:17:38,459
I gotta go.

1941
04:17:38,459 --> 04:17:38,860
You know what I mean?

1942
04:17:38,860 --> 04:17:39,180
I gotta go.

1943
04:17:39,180 --> 04:17:39,899
I gotta get out of here.

1944
04:17:39,899 --> 04:17:40,700
I gotta get out of here, man.

1945
04:17:40,700 --> 04:17:41,260
I gotta go.

1946
04:17:41,260 --> 04:17:41,899
I gotta go.

1947
04:18:13,010 --> 04:18:14,049
What is going on?

1948
04:18:16,049 --> 04:18:23,969
Oh, okay.

1949
04:18:23,969 --> 04:18:25,090
That was strange.

1950
04:18:29,969 --> 04:18:31,809
Oh my God.

1951
04:18:32,850 --> 04:18:34,049
What the fuck?

1952
04:18:36,159 --> 04:18:38,479
What in the name of God happened at the end there?

1953
04:18:54,350 --> 04:18:55,309
What the fuck?

1954
04:18:56,450 --> 04:18:57,569
That's terrifying.

1955
04:18:58,129 --> 04:19:01,340
Germo's Last Christmas.

1956
04:19:01,340 --> 04:19:03,389
Oh, all right.

1957
04:19:03,389 --> 04:19:06,670
I gotta get that off the screen into this.

1958
04:19:06,670 --> 04:19:10,110
This is, you know, I don't, well, you know what this is.

1959
04:19:10,750 --> 04:19:13,229
Do I need to even tell you what this is?

1960
04:19:14,030 --> 04:19:14,430
Let's just.

1961
04:19:35,440 --> 04:19:37,360
It only took three weeks to render.

1962
04:19:38,559 --> 04:19:49,120
That's so ridiculous.

1963
04:19:50,239 --> 04:19:51,280
Actually scary, yeah.

1964
04:19:53,920 --> 04:19:57,200
Okay, grass grows, birds fly, sun shines.

1965
04:19:57,200 --> 04:19:58,719
And brother, I hurt people.

1966
04:19:59,840 --> 04:20:00,959
I'm a force of nature.

1967
04:20:00,959 --> 04:20:03,760
But if you were from where I was from, you'd be dead.

1968
04:20:06,819 --> 04:20:08,739
I kind of turned into Voldemort for a second here though.

1969
04:20:17,709 --> 04:20:19,629
This is actually freaking me out.

1970
04:20:20,270 --> 04:20:22,340
I'll give you a link to it though.

1971
04:20:22,340 --> 04:20:24,979
That was a lot of render time.

1972
04:20:24,979 --> 04:20:25,940
A lot of computer time.

1973
04:20:30,370 --> 04:20:31,010
Germo's Scout.

1974
04:20:36,610 --> 04:20:37,889
This one's called the quintessential,

1975
04:20:37,889 --> 04:20:39,809
the most quintessential arcade sound effect.

1976
04:20:45,760 --> 04:20:47,280
Minor prize.

1977
04:20:47,280 --> 04:20:48,000
Go for the major.

1978
04:20:59,899 --> 04:21:02,620
Oh, fuck, it does that every time.

1979
04:21:02,620 --> 04:21:03,340
It does it on purpose.

1980
04:21:03,340 --> 04:21:03,899
It does it on purpose.

1981
04:21:03,899 --> 04:21:04,540
It does it on purpose.

1982
04:21:06,399 --> 04:21:07,280
It's true.

1983
04:21:08,819 --> 04:21:11,459
That's what happens when you walk by every single arcade.

1984
04:21:11,459 --> 04:21:12,420
You just hear that sound.

1985
04:21:20,219 --> 04:21:22,860
Oh, fuck, it does that every time.

1986
04:21:22,860 --> 04:21:23,579
It does it on purpose.

1987
04:21:23,579 --> 04:21:24,219
It does it on purpose.

1988
04:21:24,940 --> 04:21:29,969
Germo, it's been eight hours, please.

1989
04:21:29,969 --> 04:21:31,329
What, like I'm stuck playing the game?

1990
04:21:31,329 --> 04:21:32,690
It didn't take me that long to beat this one.

1991
04:21:34,020 --> 04:21:34,979
They have an update coming up.

1992
04:21:35,620 --> 04:21:38,590
They're adding a whole new arcade.

1993
04:21:38,590 --> 04:21:39,870
Maybe it'll be worth taking a look.

1994
04:21:40,350 --> 04:21:47,149
This one's called F.

1995
04:21:49,709 --> 04:21:54,190
Um, hold on.

1996
04:21:54,190 --> 04:21:54,750
Nobody look.

1997
04:21:58,959 --> 04:21:59,280
Okay.

1998
04:22:00,319 --> 04:22:03,280
If you've, okay, I just, I want to check something.

1999
04:22:04,799 --> 04:22:09,329
If you've never seen, if you've never seen Attack on Titan,

2000
04:22:10,860 --> 04:22:11,579
this is an anime.

2001
04:22:12,930 --> 04:22:14,209
If you've never seen Attack on Titan

2002
04:22:14,209 --> 04:22:17,889
and you don't want to be spoiled on like episode three.

2003
04:22:23,040 --> 04:22:29,440
This is an Attack on Titan like episode three reference.

2004
04:22:29,440 --> 04:22:30,959
I mean, it's like, it just is.

2005
04:22:30,959 --> 04:22:32,879
It's like an early Attack on Titan spoiler.

2006
04:22:32,879 --> 04:22:36,829
Just to tell you, no, just mute me and mute your eyes.

2007
04:22:46,030 --> 04:22:47,069
Do you see my shoe?

2008
04:23:09,329 --> 04:23:09,569
What?

2009
04:23:20,239 --> 04:23:20,639
Why?

2010
04:23:20,639 --> 04:23:20,959
Yes.

2011
04:23:21,840 --> 04:23:23,520
Wait, hold on.

2012
04:23:23,520 --> 04:23:24,239
Hold on.

2013
04:23:24,239 --> 04:23:25,200
Hold on.

2014
04:23:25,200 --> 04:23:26,319
Wait a second.

2015
04:23:31,739 --> 04:23:32,379
Fuck it, yes.

2016
04:23:46,000 --> 04:23:46,500
Wow.

2017
04:23:47,750 --> 04:23:49,270
This is what it looks like up close.

2018
04:24:06,209 --> 04:24:07,010
Turn it off.

2019
04:24:07,649 --> 04:24:09,159
Get to shut this off.

2020
04:24:09,159 --> 04:24:10,280
Shut them all off.

2021
04:24:10,280 --> 04:24:11,799
Turn your lights in your house off too.

2022
04:24:14,360 --> 04:24:18,899
This is great.

2023
04:24:27,559 --> 04:24:28,360
My stomach.

2024
04:24:30,840 --> 04:24:36,440
Things I didn't want to do on camera,

2025
04:24:36,440 --> 04:24:39,159
but did them on camera because I explained how badly

2026
04:24:39,159 --> 04:24:40,920
I didn't want to do it on camera.

2027
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:42,200
I'll take it for 200 please.

2028
04:24:49,569 --> 04:24:53,889
God, that was fucking funny.

2029
04:24:54,450 --> 04:24:56,850
You guys didn't give this one a chance and should have.

2030
04:25:03,540 --> 04:25:03,940
Link?

2031
04:25:03,940 --> 04:25:04,420
Oh yeah.

2032
04:25:06,719 --> 04:25:11,829
We got three more videos until Community Content Night number two.

2033
04:25:12,469 --> 04:25:13,600
Is that an end?

2034
04:25:14,239 --> 04:25:15,920
Two more.

2035
04:25:15,920 --> 04:25:17,360
Well, three more actually.

2036
04:25:17,360 --> 04:25:22,579
Here comes.

2037
04:25:23,700 --> 04:25:25,540
I actually don't know what the last three are.

2038
04:25:26,420 --> 04:25:27,700
It could be anything.

2039
04:25:27,700 --> 04:25:31,479
This one's called Germa Psycho.

2040
04:25:34,209 --> 04:25:34,930
Okay, here we go.

2041
04:25:36,639 --> 04:25:39,040
I usually lock up one person per stream and I eat the key

2042
04:25:39,440 --> 04:25:41,280
and I've been doing it for about three years now, so.

2043
04:25:41,280 --> 04:25:41,600
What?

2044
04:25:43,459 --> 04:25:44,899
Wait, what did I just say?

2045
04:25:47,670 --> 04:25:48,389
What the fuck?

2046
04:25:48,389 --> 04:25:49,270
When did I say this?

2047
04:25:51,110 --> 04:25:52,229
Yeah, I usually lock up one.

2048
04:25:53,909 --> 04:25:55,270
Is this like out of context?

2049
04:25:57,040 --> 04:25:58,959
Yeah, I usually lock up one person per stream

2050
04:25:58,959 --> 04:26:01,440
and I eat the key and I've been doing it for about three years now, so.

2051
04:26:18,149 --> 04:26:19,590
Life is pain.

2052
04:26:19,590 --> 04:26:20,389
I hate life.

2053
04:26:20,389 --> 04:26:21,510
Just calm down.

2054
04:26:21,510 --> 04:26:22,709
You don't have to worry about it.

2055
04:26:22,709 --> 04:26:23,590
I'm going to kill you.

2056
04:26:24,149 --> 04:26:26,229
You burn your body and eat it.

2057
04:26:26,229 --> 04:26:28,790
Every single bit of that will swallow you whole.

2058
04:26:28,790 --> 04:26:31,590
I'm going to swallow you whole.

2059
04:26:32,629 --> 04:26:33,670
Not so fast.

2060
04:26:33,670 --> 04:26:37,430
This wooden desk, you see, is 445 pounds.

2061
04:26:37,430 --> 04:26:39,110
And with ease, I can just get it.

2062
04:26:39,110 --> 04:26:40,309
I think I just ripped out the ethernet.

2063
04:26:41,190 --> 04:26:41,590
Did I?

2064
04:26:41,590 --> 04:26:42,090
No, I didn't.

2065
04:26:45,649 --> 04:26:46,610
Oh my god.

2066
04:26:47,649 --> 04:26:50,209
I'm scared of my own face.

2067
04:27:01,540 --> 04:27:03,139
What happened in this video?

2068
04:27:06,819 --> 04:27:08,739
When have I said these things?

2069
04:27:09,139 --> 04:27:11,620
I usually lock up one person per stream and I eat the key.

2070
04:27:11,620 --> 04:27:12,260
I know this one.

2071
04:27:12,260 --> 04:27:13,299
And I've been doing it for about three years now, so.

2072
04:27:18,079 --> 04:27:19,360
Life is pain.

2073
04:27:19,360 --> 04:27:20,479
Just calm down.

2074
04:27:20,479 --> 04:27:21,680
You don't have to worry about it.

2075
04:27:21,680 --> 04:27:22,559
I'm going to kill you.

2076
04:27:23,360 --> 04:27:25,200
You burn your body and then eat it.

2077
04:27:25,200 --> 04:27:27,680
Every single bit of that will swallow you whole.

2078
04:27:27,680 --> 04:27:31,120
I'm going to swallow you whole.

2079
04:27:31,120 --> 04:27:34,639
Oh, that's from the Grandpa Does Drugs, right?

2080
04:27:35,440 --> 04:27:39,440
From an old, the old Call of Duty video, okay.

2081
04:27:40,399 --> 04:27:42,559
I was like, when on earth did I do that?

2082
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:47,860
It's from Black Ops 2, right?

2083
04:27:47,860 --> 04:27:50,659
You see, it's 445 pounds.

2084
04:27:50,659 --> 04:27:52,420
And with ease, I can just get it.

2085
04:27:52,420 --> 04:27:53,379
Nobody used this.

2086
04:27:56,840 --> 04:27:57,719
Nobody used this.

2087
04:27:58,920 --> 04:28:01,000
Was this so bad that nobody used it ever?

2088
04:28:02,399 --> 04:28:05,200
I sat down and I did like a full like pretend to interview the person.

2089
04:28:06,420 --> 04:28:07,219
Does this just suck?

2090
04:28:07,219 --> 04:28:09,540
Is it no, is there no footage here that's usable?

2091
04:28:10,340 --> 04:28:11,959
What could we use it for?

2092
04:28:12,760 --> 04:28:13,719
I don't know.

2093
04:28:13,719 --> 04:28:18,790
Not so fast.

2094
04:28:18,790 --> 04:28:22,629
This wooden desk, you see, is 445 pounds.

2095
04:28:22,629 --> 04:28:24,229
And with ease, I can just get it.

2096
04:28:24,229 --> 04:28:25,430
I think it is from the Ethernet.

2097
04:28:26,629 --> 04:28:27,670
Wait, what do you do with this?

2098
04:28:33,159 --> 04:28:35,000
I guess you don't, I don't know what you use this for.

2099
04:28:35,639 --> 04:28:38,209
Don't worry.

2100
04:28:38,209 --> 04:28:42,209
You're going to get an extra fucking like eight hours of probably not that much.

2101
04:28:42,209 --> 04:28:45,969
You're going to get like an extra like six, five to four to six hours

2102
04:28:46,770 --> 04:28:48,370
of new actions in front of the screen.

2103
04:28:49,010 --> 04:28:51,489
You use it as a segue.

2104
04:28:51,489 --> 04:28:51,889
That's true.

2105
04:28:55,670 --> 04:28:57,110
I don't know about this one.

2106
04:28:57,190 --> 04:29:02,709
So I'm going to, I'm going to play this and then I might have to stop playing this one

2107
04:29:02,709 --> 04:29:07,700
because I see the title and it's, this is, this might be a very quick turn off.

2108
04:29:08,579 --> 04:29:11,059
Star, let's put cigarettes out on my dick.

2109
04:29:11,059 --> 04:29:11,379
Okay.

2110
04:29:11,379 --> 04:29:13,860
So already I know it's not going to work.

2111
04:29:14,899 --> 04:29:17,700
I told you I was fucking pumped up to like do this shit.

2112
04:29:17,700 --> 04:29:18,659
I'm pumped up right now.

2113
04:29:18,659 --> 04:29:19,379
We're both pumped.

2114
04:29:19,379 --> 04:29:20,579
Call us the pump brothers.

2115
04:29:20,579 --> 04:29:21,860
I'm going to teach you how to pull it off.

2116
04:29:21,860 --> 04:29:22,659
Star, are you ready for this?

2117
04:29:22,659 --> 04:29:23,700
I want to see how to pull it off.

2118
04:29:25,059 --> 04:29:25,700
Okay.

2119
04:29:25,700 --> 04:29:26,739
We're not going to play this one.

2120
04:29:29,280 --> 04:29:30,159
That was the last one.

2121
04:29:50,370 --> 04:29:51,969
That was so fucked up.

2122
04:29:52,690 --> 04:29:53,889
That was so fucked up.

2123
04:29:53,889 --> 04:29:55,010
I'm not playing that.

2124
04:29:55,729 --> 04:29:57,090
No, I'm not playing that.

2125
04:29:57,090 --> 04:29:57,809
We'll play this one.

2126
04:30:09,750 --> 04:30:10,469
I said it.

2127
04:30:11,270 --> 04:30:12,340
Yeah.

2128
04:30:13,219 --> 04:30:14,020
Long time ago.

2129
04:30:15,920 --> 04:30:16,479
It's here.

2130
04:30:16,479 --> 04:30:16,959
What's here?

2131
04:30:19,459 --> 04:30:20,020
What's here?

2132
04:30:23,440 --> 04:30:26,559
I know I said this like 10 years ago.

2133
04:30:27,120 --> 04:30:35,489
You just linked me the video.

2134
04:30:35,489 --> 04:30:36,129
Oh, okay.

2135
04:30:36,129 --> 04:30:36,370
Good.

2136
04:30:37,010 --> 04:30:38,129
I'm not clicking it.

2137
04:30:38,129 --> 04:30:41,989
But that, that actually is the end.

2138
04:30:41,989 --> 04:30:46,360
Except, except there's still one more thing.

2139
04:30:46,920 --> 04:30:48,690
That's the end of the videos.

2140
04:30:48,690 --> 04:30:49,250
That's the end of it.

2141
04:30:49,250 --> 04:30:51,250
Thank you everybody for your submissions.

2142
04:30:53,329 --> 04:30:55,649
There's, there's a, there should be.

2143
04:30:55,649 --> 04:30:56,610
Well, let me make sure there is.

2144
04:30:57,250 --> 04:30:58,819
Where is it?

2145
04:30:58,819 --> 04:30:59,219
Where is it?

2146
04:30:59,219 --> 04:30:59,620
Where is it?

2147
04:30:59,620 --> 04:30:59,940
Where is it?

2148
04:30:59,940 --> 04:31:00,659
Where is it?

2149
04:31:00,659 --> 04:31:01,139
There is.

2150
04:31:01,139 --> 04:31:01,540
There is.

2151
04:31:01,540 --> 04:31:02,500
There is, right?

2152
04:31:02,500 --> 04:31:02,899
Is there?

2153
04:31:03,540 --> 04:31:04,629
There is.

2154
04:31:04,629 --> 04:31:04,870
Okay.

2155
04:31:06,389 --> 04:31:08,629
So there are a few songs.

2156
04:31:08,629 --> 04:31:10,000
Do you guys remember?

2157
04:31:12,899 --> 04:31:13,620
Spoiled.

2158
04:31:13,860 --> 04:31:14,979
Do you remember when I did the,

2159
04:31:14,979 --> 04:31:17,299
I told you that the rat, the third rats song.

2160
04:31:19,010 --> 04:31:21,489
I talked about how that this is what it was going to be.

2161
04:31:21,489 --> 04:31:23,409
And I did it and I, and I tried to make it.

2162
04:31:24,049 --> 04:31:24,770
Somebody made it.

2163
04:31:24,770 --> 04:31:26,610
And this is exactly what it was going to be.

2164
04:31:27,170 --> 04:31:30,770
This is the actual, like what the third rats movie song was going to sound like.

2165
04:31:31,489 --> 04:31:32,149
Here you go.

2166
04:31:44,870 --> 04:32:01,440
Yeah.

2167
04:32:01,440 --> 04:32:05,840
And then the horn comes in and then the horn comes in.

2168
04:32:06,719 --> 04:32:21,000
You aren't listening.

2169
04:32:21,639 --> 04:32:22,200
I took off.

2170
04:32:22,200 --> 04:32:22,440
Yeah.

2171
04:32:23,159 --> 04:32:25,219
It's because it was really loud for me.

2172
04:32:26,790 --> 04:32:27,510
You aren't even.

2173
04:32:27,510 --> 04:32:28,389
I didn't mean to not listen.

2174
04:32:28,389 --> 04:32:30,389
I could hear it because it was so loud because I had my.

2175
04:32:31,510 --> 04:32:33,030
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

2176
04:32:33,030 --> 04:32:33,510
No, no.

2177
04:32:34,629 --> 04:32:37,479
It was very loud for me.

2178
04:32:37,479 --> 04:32:39,159
So even with it out, I could hear it very clearly.

2179
04:32:41,989 --> 04:32:44,819
No, the horn comes in.

2180
04:32:46,020 --> 04:32:52,440
He hates it.

2181
04:32:52,440 --> 04:32:52,940
What?

2182
04:32:57,379 --> 04:32:58,260
I don't hate it.

2183
04:33:11,509 --> 04:33:12,869
Stop making me shit any grin.

2184
04:33:12,869 --> 04:33:13,590
I don't.

2185
04:33:13,590 --> 04:33:19,479
It's very good.

2186
04:33:21,479 --> 04:33:23,349
The greedy grinner.

2187
04:33:23,909 --> 04:33:24,389
That's me.

2188
04:33:25,110 --> 04:33:30,560
There's also, there's, let's see what this one is.

2189
04:33:36,150 --> 04:33:37,189
I have my first kiss here.

2190
04:33:37,669 --> 04:33:42,389
That's before the play, kid.

2191
04:33:43,669 --> 04:33:44,709
I have my first kiss here.

2192
04:33:48,799 --> 04:33:49,840
That's before the play, kid.

2193
04:33:52,720 --> 04:33:53,279
Big face.

2194
04:33:53,279 --> 04:33:53,520
Yeah.

2195
04:33:56,919 --> 04:33:57,639
Oh, he's grinning.

2196
04:33:57,639 --> 04:33:58,520
He's grinning again.

2197
04:34:07,590 --> 04:34:10,720
This one's pretty good.

2198
04:34:14,000 --> 04:34:14,799
No emotion.

2199
04:34:15,439 --> 04:34:18,720
Why would I do no emotion for a hot single like this?

2200
04:34:22,240 --> 04:34:26,069
Our commercial with me or this?

2201
04:34:28,869 --> 04:34:31,240
React more.

2202
04:34:31,240 --> 04:34:31,720
All right, fine.

2203
04:34:32,759 --> 04:34:37,509
No, I'm not going to react more.

2204
04:34:39,939 --> 04:34:43,909
Why would you want me to turn it like a fucking cartoon?

2205
04:34:45,349 --> 04:34:46,389
Is this what you were looking for?

2206
04:34:47,509 --> 04:34:48,009
Wow.

2207
04:34:48,979 --> 04:34:50,500
What an interesting song this is.

2208
04:34:56,610 --> 04:34:57,889
I especially like this part.

2209
04:34:58,610 --> 04:35:06,720
Are we in sync?

2210
04:35:10,919 --> 04:35:12,439
That's what Mark Zuckerberg does.

2211
04:35:12,439 --> 04:35:13,159
You know what?

2212
04:35:13,159 --> 04:35:13,799
Is that what he does?

2213
04:35:15,000 --> 04:35:15,799
He just goes like,

2214
04:35:28,790 --> 04:35:41,000
I could just like bop my head to this.

2215
04:35:41,000 --> 04:35:41,959
This is a head bopper.

2216
04:35:43,990 --> 04:35:44,709
Dance to the music.

2217
04:36:02,880 --> 04:36:03,680
Thriller shoulder.

2218
04:36:09,060 --> 04:36:10,580
What the fuck is German dancing?

2219
04:36:10,580 --> 04:36:11,220
Why am I dancing?

2220
04:36:11,220 --> 04:36:12,900
Because I'm listening to a community made song.

2221
04:36:15,299 --> 04:36:17,619
I painted my living room wall green.

2222
04:36:17,619 --> 04:36:18,840
I hope it looks all right.

2223
04:36:20,119 --> 04:36:20,439
Did it?

2224
04:36:20,439 --> 04:36:21,080
I hope it did.

2225
04:36:21,959 --> 04:36:23,349
What's the name of the song?

2226
04:36:23,349 --> 04:36:26,709
It's called Jerma 51.

2227
04:36:26,709 --> 04:36:32,529
You want to link to this one?

2228
04:36:41,330 --> 04:36:42,849
And that...

2229
04:36:42,849 --> 04:36:43,729
Wait, we got one more.

2230
04:36:44,290 --> 04:36:47,189
This one is called...

2231
04:36:47,189 --> 04:36:48,549
This one's called Wait on Red.

2232
04:36:49,430 --> 04:36:53,720
It's inspired from the ending screen.

2233
04:36:57,409 --> 04:37:02,279
Don't forget this one.

2234
04:37:03,729 --> 04:37:04,770
So wait, wait.

2235
04:37:04,770 --> 04:37:05,409
What are you linking?

2236
04:37:05,970 --> 04:37:07,560
Let me...

2237
04:37:07,560 --> 04:37:08,360
Don't forget this one.

2238
04:37:09,729 --> 04:37:10,290
Jerma...

2239
04:37:10,290 --> 04:37:16,479
Jackson Jerma duet singing September on stream.

2240
04:37:16,479 --> 04:37:18,799
What are you talking about?

2241
04:37:19,360 --> 04:37:25,759
Did that come in today?

2242
04:37:26,319 --> 04:37:30,240
Because this is all as of like last night.

2243
04:37:30,240 --> 04:37:30,479
Was it...

2244
04:37:30,479 --> 04:37:31,680
Did it come in today?

2245
04:37:31,680 --> 04:37:33,040
Was that like this afternoon?

2246
04:37:33,759 --> 04:37:36,259
That's gonna have to be on the next one.

2247
04:37:36,900 --> 04:37:39,330
It was from 11 hours ago.

2248
04:37:39,330 --> 04:37:41,939
The cutoff was yesterday.

2249
04:37:41,939 --> 04:37:42,580
Who cares?

2250
04:37:43,139 --> 04:37:49,619
I'm trying to listen to a song.

2251
04:37:50,959 --> 04:37:51,439
Fine.

2252
04:37:51,439 --> 04:37:52,159
Link it to me again.

2253
04:37:53,279 --> 04:37:55,639
Follow the rules.

2254
04:37:58,080 --> 04:37:59,040
You are the streamer.

2255
04:37:59,040 --> 04:37:59,680
Make the rules.

2256
04:38:00,849 --> 04:38:01,409
No, no, no.

2257
04:38:01,409 --> 04:38:02,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2258
04:38:02,770 --> 04:38:03,650
Save it for next time.

2259
04:38:04,369 --> 04:38:10,869
What?

2260
04:38:10,869 --> 04:38:11,909
Somebody call me a skull?

2261
04:38:12,470 --> 04:38:17,569
Wait, why are you calling me a skull?

2262
04:38:17,569 --> 04:38:18,529
Fuck your rules.

2263
04:38:19,169 --> 04:38:23,459
Do you want me to just fucking sneeze over there?

2264
04:38:24,340 --> 04:38:26,340
And just sneeze into you and have it just...

2265
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:27,459
You just fall backwards.

2266
04:38:28,099 --> 04:38:29,939
With the might of the air that comes out of my body.

2267
04:38:35,200 --> 04:38:37,119
No, we need content.

2268
04:38:37,119 --> 04:38:38,959
This happens every like 30 or 40 days.

2269
04:38:40,610 --> 04:38:42,049
It's a perfect amount of time.

2270
04:38:43,590 --> 04:38:44,790
Four to five hours.

2271
04:38:44,790 --> 04:38:47,029
That's perfect for like a full community stream.

2272
04:38:48,560 --> 04:38:49,919
Yeah, we want to have to...

2273
04:38:49,919 --> 04:38:53,040
I want this to be like three plus, four plus hours every time.

2274
04:38:53,680 --> 04:39:00,689
I'll sneeze in your face.

2275
04:39:00,689 --> 04:39:01,409
Well, don't do that.

2276
04:39:03,840 --> 04:39:06,000
Give us the post or give us uh oh stinky.

2277
04:39:07,119 --> 04:39:11,159
You're not going to get any of those things.

2278
04:39:11,799 --> 04:39:14,560
Give me the rats link.

2279
04:39:14,560 --> 04:39:15,599
Well, let me link all of these.

2280
04:39:17,080 --> 04:39:17,880
This is the rats one.

2281
04:39:18,599 --> 04:39:24,209
And then this is the one we just listened to.

2282
04:39:24,849 --> 04:39:31,029
I'm not gonna play that video.

2283
04:39:31,909 --> 04:39:34,720
Why would I play that?

2284
04:39:35,889 --> 04:39:38,130
It's like me gnoming myself.

2285
04:39:38,770 --> 04:39:40,020
What's going on?

2286
04:39:40,020 --> 04:39:40,900
Why does my camera do this?

2287
04:39:47,040 --> 04:39:48,080
No, that's it for today.

2288
04:39:48,799 --> 04:39:50,849
See?

2289
04:39:50,849 --> 04:39:51,729
Why does it do that shit?

2290
04:39:52,290 --> 04:40:01,439
So what's going to happen here over the next couple days is tomorrow...

2291
04:40:01,439 --> 04:40:04,000
I have no idea what I'm going to stream tomorrow.

2292
04:40:09,599 --> 04:40:12,240
Because there's like two or three things that I really want to do.

2293
04:40:12,880 --> 04:40:17,479
But I'm not sure if...

2294
04:40:17,479 --> 04:40:19,000
I don't know which one I want to do.

2295
04:40:19,560 --> 04:40:25,669
Because like Outer Worlds is something that I thought I would want to do.

2296
04:40:26,310 --> 04:40:28,229
Dead Rising 2 is something I want to do.

2297
04:40:30,099 --> 04:40:33,779
It's Katamari is another one that would be fun to do like the second Katamari game.

2298
04:40:35,959 --> 04:40:38,279
I'm gonna have to like throw dice in the air.

2299
04:40:39,080 --> 04:40:39,799
I really don't know.

2300
04:40:45,110 --> 04:40:47,509
I'm gonna actually throw dice up in the air.

2301
04:40:47,509 --> 04:40:49,349
And whatever they land on, I'll have numbers for each one.

2302
04:40:52,229 --> 04:40:52,549
We'll see.

2303
04:40:52,549 --> 04:40:53,349
It'll be something fun.

2304
04:40:54,599 --> 04:40:58,840
And then as of this coming weekend here, there's going to be another...

2305
04:40:58,840 --> 04:41:02,680
I'm going to address you directly because I feel like it's more interpersonal that way.

2306
04:41:03,880 --> 04:41:07,639
In like three days, there's going to be another channel in that Discord.

2307
04:41:07,639 --> 04:41:12,279
It's going to be the Green Screen Movie Night DLC for free.

2308
04:41:12,279 --> 04:41:12,680
You're going to go.

2309
04:41:12,680 --> 04:41:13,639
There's going to be two channels.

2310
04:41:13,639 --> 04:41:19,490
One to discuss and one to make suggestions.

2311
04:41:19,490 --> 04:41:22,369
And then the Green Screen stream will happen probably two weeks from now.

2312
04:41:23,430 --> 04:41:27,889
Two to three weeks, depending on how many submissions we get.

2313
04:41:27,889 --> 04:41:29,250
Dead Rising 2 has gambling?

2314
04:41:29,970 --> 04:41:31,569
Well, you just convinced me.

2315
04:41:34,770 --> 04:41:35,650
Eyes up here.

2316
04:41:44,580 --> 04:41:45,779
Fuck do I read these things?

2317
04:41:51,139 --> 04:41:55,060
Anyways, the whole game takes place in Vegas, does it actually?

2318
04:41:55,060 --> 04:41:55,619
Is it for real?

2319
04:41:55,619 --> 04:41:56,740
That's pretty cool actually.

2320
04:41:59,090 --> 04:42:01,779
All right, thank you again.

2321
04:42:02,840 --> 04:42:05,080
I love doing this shit.

2322
04:42:05,080 --> 04:42:08,599
I think there's a ton of people that need to be showcased in this community.

2323
04:42:08,599 --> 04:42:11,560
I think you guys make some of the funniest shit that I've seen.

2324
04:42:12,119 --> 04:42:16,840
They were at least, again, like last time, at least five to 10 of these videos and images

2325
04:42:17,639 --> 04:42:19,560
that made me heart laughing.

2326
04:42:19,560 --> 04:42:23,639
So I cannot wait to give you guys all more material

2327
04:42:24,689 --> 04:42:28,900
because the more material that you have,

2328
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:31,860
the more shit that you could just come up with.

2329
04:42:31,860 --> 04:42:35,299
And I love every second of it.

2330
04:42:35,299 --> 04:42:39,509
So thank you so much for all of your contributions.

2331
04:42:39,509 --> 04:42:40,310
There's a lot of them.

2332
04:42:41,029 --> 04:42:42,229
People continue to put stuff.

2333
04:42:42,229 --> 04:42:44,310
If you don't know, go to the Discord.

2334
04:42:44,310 --> 04:42:45,430
Community content nights.

2335
04:42:46,150 --> 04:42:46,950
Put something there.

2336
04:42:47,830 --> 04:42:50,150
Art, video, music related.

2337
04:42:50,150 --> 04:42:51,830
Something related to the community or the channel.

2338
04:42:52,389 --> 04:42:54,680
And I can't wait to see it.

2339
04:42:58,959 --> 04:43:01,119
Great fucking job.

2340
04:43:01,759 --> 04:43:23,959
I will see you guys tomorrow for either Dead Rising 2 or Outer Worlds or Katamari or I don't know.

2341
04:43:23,959 --> 04:43:28,520
No, I'm probably not going to play on stream Death Stranding.

2342
04:43:28,520 --> 04:43:30,240
Looks really interesting.

2343
04:43:30,240 --> 04:43:31,520
Dead Rising 2 off the record.

2344
04:43:32,080 --> 04:43:33,919
Well, you put an emote on it.

2345
04:43:33,919 --> 04:43:41,330
So it really is going to come down to what I want to do tomorrow.

2346
04:43:42,049 --> 04:43:43,409
I'm going to get up in the morning and I'm going to go, you know what?

2347
04:43:43,409 --> 04:43:43,970
That's what I want.

2348
04:43:43,970 --> 04:43:45,250
I'm going to do Dead Rising 2.

2349
04:43:45,889 --> 04:43:47,650
Or like, no, I want to play like an RPG.

2350
04:43:48,450 --> 04:43:52,900
It's how I get up in the morning tomorrow.

2351
04:43:52,900 --> 04:43:56,549
Death Stranding is an awful stream game.

2352
04:43:56,549 --> 04:43:58,389
I mean, it looks like people are having fun with it.

2353
04:43:58,389 --> 04:44:00,069
I know a ton of people are streaming it right now.

2354
04:44:04,360 --> 04:44:18,369
I don't think I want to play it on stream though.

2355
04:44:18,369 --> 04:44:19,889
More like walking.

2356
04:44:20,610 --> 04:44:23,029
It's all good.

2357
04:44:24,020 --> 04:44:24,979
But I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2358
04:44:24,979 --> 04:44:25,939
We'll figure it out.

2359
04:44:25,939 --> 04:44:27,299
I'll be in the pre-stream.

2360
04:44:27,299 --> 04:44:29,080
You guys will see me in the pre-stream.

2361
04:44:29,639 --> 04:44:33,439
At least an hour or so before the stream starts in the first place and we'll figure it out.

2362
04:44:33,439 --> 04:44:34,319
We'll go over what we can do.

2363
04:44:34,880 --> 04:44:38,240
Thanks for watching, guys.

2364
04:44:38,880 --> 04:44:45,939
So before Community Content Night number three happens,

2365
04:44:46,740 --> 04:44:49,459
there will be a second green screen.

2366
04:44:49,459 --> 04:44:52,130
So keep that in mind.

2367
04:44:52,689 --> 04:44:56,240
The one that will happen in next month,

2368
04:44:58,080 --> 04:45:01,860
I might push it back a few extra weeks, like a week or two,

2369
04:45:01,860 --> 04:45:05,540
just to make sure if people want to get some of the second green screen stuff in, they can.

2370
04:45:06,099 --> 04:45:13,279
Is Community Night monthly?

2371
04:45:14,659 --> 04:45:23,880
Monthly with an asterisk because it's probably going to end up to be every month and a half.

2372
04:45:26,610 --> 04:45:28,369
Because the last one was in September.

2373
04:45:28,369 --> 04:45:31,889
September like 20th or like September like 18th or something.

2374
04:45:32,610 --> 04:45:36,709
And now we're at November 10th.

2375
04:45:36,709 --> 04:45:38,790
So it's probably going to be like bimonthly.

2376
04:45:39,430 --> 04:45:45,200
Because that does have to be enough to do a stream on it.

2377
04:45:45,200 --> 04:45:50,799
So that channel will load up every month or two.

2378
04:45:50,799 --> 04:45:53,759
When there's enough to do like a three, four hour stream, then hell yeah.

2379
04:46:00,279 --> 04:46:01,400
Thanks a lot, though.

2380
04:46:01,400 --> 04:46:06,369
It's still the same.

2381
04:46:07,400 --> 04:46:08,119
It'll always be.

2382
04:46:08,119 --> 04:46:08,840
It's bilateral.

2383
04:46:08,840 --> 04:46:09,639
It's always going to be you.

2384
04:46:14,529 --> 04:46:15,169
Did he watch?

2385
04:46:15,490 --> 04:46:15,970
Stinky.

2386
04:46:15,970 --> 04:46:16,930
Yeah, I did.

2387
04:46:16,930 --> 04:46:18,290
I watched it twice.

2388
04:46:18,290 --> 04:46:20,290
Once in slow motion to make sure I could get the whole thing.

2389
04:46:20,849 --> 04:46:24,639
But let's do the bits.

2390
04:46:25,279 --> 04:46:26,659
See you tomorrow.

2391
04:46:26,659 --> 04:46:27,939
Take care of yourselves.

2392
04:46:27,939 --> 04:46:32,599
If you're sticking around, we've got a little bit of extra talking to do here.

2393
04:46:33,159 --> 04:46:40,159
So we had snowflakes.

2394
04:46:40,159 --> 04:46:41,279
Am I right for 250?

2395
04:46:41,279 --> 04:46:43,599
They said my PC blue screened earlier this week.

2396
04:46:44,319 --> 04:46:48,400
Got it working this week at about $600 worth of parts later.

2397
04:46:49,479 --> 04:46:50,200
That's not good.

2398
04:46:50,840 --> 04:46:53,040
I didn't get around to posting on the Discord.

2399
04:46:53,040 --> 04:46:54,319
Did a few more portraits.

2400
04:46:55,299 --> 04:46:57,060
Plus watermarked the older one.

2401
04:46:57,060 --> 04:47:00,819
Oh, stick those in there.

2402
04:47:01,619 --> 04:47:02,500
Stick those in there.

2403
04:47:04,150 --> 04:47:05,349
Stick those in there.

2404
04:47:05,349 --> 04:47:06,310
Stick those in there.

2405
04:47:11,270 --> 04:47:12,790
These are so good.

2406
04:47:20,209 --> 04:47:24,930
Now everybody just everybody just left their portraits.

2407
04:47:27,540 --> 04:47:28,900
We saw two of these already.

2408
04:47:34,819 --> 04:47:38,040
Uh, I watermarked the older ones.

2409
04:47:38,040 --> 04:47:40,520
There is a glue man and auto portrait.

2410
04:47:41,159 --> 04:47:43,029
Catching up on all VODs.

2411
04:47:43,029 --> 04:47:44,549
Did Kim enjoy the portrait?

2412
04:47:44,549 --> 04:47:45,990
I'll upload them to my Insta.

2413
04:47:45,990 --> 04:47:46,790
Same as the watermark.

2414
04:47:46,790 --> 04:47:47,509
Hope that's chill.

2415
04:47:53,970 --> 04:47:55,250
Yeah, they're fucking incredible.

2416
04:47:55,889 --> 04:48:00,709
This is fucking unbelievable.

2417
04:48:00,709 --> 04:48:01,270
Like, all right.

2418
04:48:02,790 --> 04:48:04,150
This was technically...

2419
04:48:04,150 --> 04:48:06,470
Technically it was supposed to be there yesterday.

2420
04:48:06,470 --> 04:48:09,490
This was supposed to be there yesterday.

2421
04:48:09,490 --> 04:48:11,169
Because their computer fucked up.

2422
04:48:11,169 --> 04:48:11,669
Okay?

2423
04:48:14,209 --> 04:48:14,930
Right?

2424
04:48:14,930 --> 04:48:17,720
This is not breaking any rules.

2425
04:48:18,279 --> 04:48:19,799
This was supposed to be submitted yesterday.

2426
04:48:22,919 --> 04:48:26,180
But look at this.

2427
04:48:26,180 --> 04:48:31,299
I promise you guys this is not just like a close-up of like inside of my nose.

2428
04:48:31,299 --> 04:48:40,200
Let me get this on the viewing angle here.

2429
04:48:47,220 --> 04:48:48,500
I thought this was a photo.

2430
04:48:49,139 --> 04:48:52,180
That's how ridiculous this is.

2431
04:49:05,409 --> 04:49:06,049
Are you kidding me?

2432
04:49:08,310 --> 04:49:09,110
Look at that.

2433
04:49:09,750 --> 04:49:11,430
That's unbelievable.

2434
04:49:12,709 --> 04:49:14,630
That's unbelievable.

2435
04:49:15,779 --> 04:49:17,139
This is a camera.

2436
04:49:17,139 --> 04:49:18,020
This is a photo.

2437
04:49:24,229 --> 04:49:25,909
I had I gotta break the rule.

2438
04:49:32,759 --> 04:49:33,319
You know?

2439
04:49:33,319 --> 04:49:33,819
Okay.

2440
04:49:34,520 --> 04:49:36,439
My like mother would love this.

2441
04:49:40,869 --> 04:49:42,389
Look at this like detail.

2442
04:49:44,979 --> 04:49:46,419
I can't even describe how good this is.

2443
04:49:50,849 --> 04:49:51,889
Nice work.

2444
04:49:51,889 --> 04:49:52,450
Seriously.

2445
04:49:53,409 --> 04:49:57,090
That's like a 10 out of 10.

2446
04:50:01,700 --> 04:50:02,340
Yeah, they drew this.

2447
04:50:02,340 --> 04:50:02,979
They drew this.

2448
04:50:03,619 --> 04:50:06,759
And there's another one.

2449
04:50:07,880 --> 04:50:09,400
The other one is of Glooman.

2450
04:50:14,000 --> 04:50:14,959
And wait a minute.

2451
04:50:14,959 --> 04:50:15,599
Oh, please.

2452
04:50:16,240 --> 04:50:17,520
Wait, please.

2453
04:50:17,520 --> 04:50:18,799
Oh my god.

2454
04:50:18,799 --> 04:50:20,560
I'm gonna like actually...

2455
04:50:20,560 --> 04:50:21,360
I'm gonna print this.

2456
04:50:21,919 --> 04:50:23,279
It's my favorite character.

2457
04:50:26,759 --> 04:50:27,080
Yes!

2458
04:50:28,689 --> 04:50:29,810
It's Bugleberry.

2459
04:50:29,810 --> 04:50:30,770
There's a...

2460
04:50:30,770 --> 04:50:35,520
You did a Bugleberry.

2461
04:50:35,520 --> 04:50:36,319
Fantastic.

2462
04:50:36,319 --> 04:50:36,819
Hold on.

2463
04:50:37,360 --> 04:50:51,830
It's wild.

2464
04:50:51,830 --> 04:50:59,490
And there's that one and then there's a Glooman as well.

2465
04:51:05,560 --> 04:51:06,279
Best car...

2466
04:51:06,279 --> 04:51:07,720
Best worst character ever.

2467
04:51:08,689 --> 04:51:10,770
Speaking of best worst characters ever.

2468
04:51:10,770 --> 04:51:24,529
There's another one.

2469
04:51:24,529 --> 04:51:25,650
Good shit.

2470
04:51:25,650 --> 04:51:33,560
Let's get it in close.

2471
04:51:34,119 --> 04:51:45,590
This is the kind of shit that I would print out all three of these

2472
04:51:46,450 --> 04:51:49,409
and put them in small frames and have it decorate my entryway.

2473
04:51:56,290 --> 04:51:57,250
That's incredible.

2474
04:51:58,319 --> 04:51:58,959
Do it then.

2475
04:51:58,959 --> 04:51:59,599
Maybe I will.

2476
04:52:04,310 --> 04:52:05,189
Thank you so much.

2477
04:52:05,189 --> 04:52:07,590
Sorry you couldn't get it in by today.

2478
04:52:09,200 --> 04:52:10,639
But that sucks here about your computer.

2479
04:52:10,639 --> 04:52:11,520
That was Snowflakes.

2480
04:52:11,520 --> 04:52:13,139
Am I right?

2481
04:52:13,220 --> 04:52:16,319
Or Sneewluckeys.

2482
04:52:16,319 --> 04:52:22,340
With those insane incredible pieces of art.

2483
04:52:22,340 --> 04:52:23,060
Thank you for those.

2484
04:52:27,720 --> 04:52:31,680
We had 250 bits from Espada.

2485
04:52:31,680 --> 04:52:33,759
They say checks taste like shit.

2486
04:52:33,759 --> 04:52:34,159
I agree.

2487
04:52:38,639 --> 04:52:39,439
Checks do.

2488
04:52:39,439 --> 04:52:40,240
I don't like them.

2489
04:52:40,240 --> 04:52:41,040
I think they're very bad.

2490
04:52:41,599 --> 04:52:43,479
I agree with...

2491
04:52:43,479 --> 04:52:44,439
Don't break everything.

2492
04:52:46,500 --> 04:52:48,419
Every time you hear noise like that,

2493
04:52:49,400 --> 04:52:53,080
that's me raising my arms to talk with my hands

2494
04:52:53,080 --> 04:52:54,759
and smashing into something on my desk.

2495
04:52:55,700 --> 04:52:56,979
That's why that happens.

2496
04:53:00,610 --> 04:53:01,490
Like me putting my hands up.

2497
04:53:01,490 --> 04:53:08,659
Like moving my hands around.

2498
04:53:08,659 --> 04:53:10,020
Thank you Topac for the 250.

2499
04:53:10,020 --> 04:53:11,459
Shido was alive and well with the whole gang.

2500
04:53:11,459 --> 04:53:14,099
They've released a new music video and they're coming for you next.

2501
04:53:14,659 --> 04:53:21,009
It's a sweet victory.

2502
04:53:21,009 --> 04:53:21,810
Automaton.

2503
04:53:29,569 --> 04:53:36,040
Thank you, Topac.

2504
04:53:36,040 --> 04:53:39,240
Hey, thank you Stevie the XEV for the 400 bits.

2505
04:53:40,740 --> 04:53:43,299
They say I had a dream about you two nights ago

2506
04:53:43,299 --> 04:53:47,220
where you were hosting some strange who wants to be a millionaire event IRL with fans

2507
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:48,340
and viewers you invited.

2508
04:53:48,900 --> 04:53:51,779
Viewers who lost you started openly taunting

2509
04:53:52,740 --> 04:53:54,020
and mocking each time.

2510
04:53:54,900 --> 04:53:58,400
My friend got up and nominated me after their turn

2511
04:53:58,400 --> 04:53:59,680
in which you gave me a hug

2512
04:53:59,680 --> 04:54:01,439
and the event turned into some jackbox game

2513
04:54:01,439 --> 04:54:03,759
where the answer is picked by majority vote by fans.

2514
04:54:04,479 --> 04:54:06,479
Of course, the first answer was feet.

2515
04:54:07,040 --> 04:54:08,880
Feetsies in which you overreacted.

2516
04:54:21,639 --> 04:54:25,810
At least I wasn't trying to like chase you and kill you.

2517
04:54:26,290 --> 04:54:28,130
Like some people have weird dreams like that.

2518
04:54:28,930 --> 04:54:33,720
But thank you, Stevie.

2519
04:54:33,720 --> 04:54:35,080
Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.

2520
04:54:35,080 --> 04:54:36,599
You talk about how you want new emotes.

2521
04:54:36,599 --> 04:54:38,040
Don't forget Jerma infected.

2522
04:54:38,040 --> 04:54:39,080
Jerma test.

2523
04:54:39,080 --> 04:54:41,240
Someone even shrunk it down and made it look really good.

2524
04:54:44,099 --> 04:54:45,700
We're gonna, you know what we're gonna have to do?

2525
04:54:45,700 --> 04:54:46,659
Pause the music for a second.

2526
04:54:47,299 --> 04:54:50,709
We're going to have to do a night

2527
04:54:50,709 --> 04:54:56,180
where the point of the stream is to add emotes.

2528
04:54:56,740 --> 04:55:01,110
You gotta catch me on camera, on stream.

2529
04:55:01,110 --> 04:55:08,040
And we do it on stream.

2530
04:55:08,040 --> 04:55:10,200
This is, I don't know, this will probably take a couple hours.

2531
04:55:10,840 --> 04:55:16,389
I will even title the stream like I'm just putting up new emotes.

2532
04:55:16,389 --> 04:55:17,029
Don't watch.

2533
04:55:21,169 --> 04:55:22,689
There'd be no reason to watch.

2534
04:55:22,689 --> 04:55:23,569
But you got me.

2535
04:55:23,569 --> 04:55:24,610
And you got me on camera.

2536
04:55:24,610 --> 04:55:26,290
And let's put in like 10 new emotes.

2537
04:55:26,849 --> 04:55:46,069
We'll probably do that at some point soon.

2538
04:55:46,069 --> 04:55:46,630
Not tomorrow.

2539
04:55:46,630 --> 04:55:48,150
No, tomorrow, I'm gonna play a game tomorrow.

2540
04:55:48,709 --> 04:55:53,619
Hey Stinky, thanks for the 250.

2541
04:55:53,619 --> 04:55:54,740
They say eat boogers.

2542
04:55:55,669 --> 04:55:56,709
Sometimes you do accidentally.

2543
04:55:56,709 --> 04:55:57,750
Everybody does.

2544
04:55:57,750 --> 04:55:58,229
It's okay.

2545
04:56:01,799 --> 04:56:04,040
Thank you, Alamanda for the 1500 bits.

2546
04:56:04,599 --> 04:56:08,759
They say, hey Jerma, I know I really love your streams

2547
04:56:08,759 --> 04:56:10,439
because none of my friends know who you are.

2548
04:56:11,000 --> 04:56:13,880
And yet I still, I love it still.

2549
04:56:13,880 --> 04:56:15,080
Here's a joke as payment.

2550
04:56:17,490 --> 04:56:31,279
My girlfriend has a, not allergy.

2551
04:56:31,919 --> 04:56:40,439
Something, something, something.

2552
04:56:41,000 --> 04:56:46,099
That is like another part of the joke.

2553
04:56:46,099 --> 04:56:47,139
I just didn't write it.

2554
04:56:47,860 --> 04:56:50,080
I didn't read it.

2555
04:56:50,639 --> 04:56:51,279
That's not bad.

2556
04:56:51,279 --> 04:56:52,880
But I don't even know why I stopped.

2557
04:56:52,880 --> 04:57:00,040
I don't know.

2558
04:57:00,040 --> 04:57:02,869
So you admit that you're, I'm not the joker.

2559
04:57:05,669 --> 04:57:09,110
I don't even, I can't, I'm trying to piece this like riddle joke together.

2560
04:57:09,110 --> 04:57:14,599
I can't, I, thank you for the incredible 1500 bits.

2561
04:57:18,599 --> 04:57:21,400
But it doesn't matter if your friends don't know who I am.

2562
04:57:21,400 --> 04:57:27,759
It's all good.

2563
04:57:29,040 --> 04:57:30,319
Maybe they'll find eventually.

2564
04:57:31,459 --> 04:57:35,619
Just link them to the screaming, crying, farting, face slap video.

2565
04:57:35,619 --> 04:57:37,220
I'm sure there'll be a fan immediately.

2566
04:57:40,720 --> 04:57:41,919
No, thanks for the $15 though.

2567
04:57:41,919 --> 04:57:42,319
Seriously.

2568
04:57:42,319 --> 04:57:45,119
Thank you, Doc3660 for the 300 bits.

2569
04:57:46,950 --> 04:57:48,310
Jerma, I could really use some advice.

2570
04:57:48,310 --> 04:57:50,549
I'm 22 right now and I'm really skinny.

2571
04:57:50,549 --> 04:57:55,889
I want to gain muscle and get bigger, but not sure where to start.

2572
04:57:55,889 --> 04:57:59,250
Do I eat like crazy for a month, get fat and then hit the gym?

2573
04:57:59,970 --> 04:58:02,290
Do I just hit the gym right away and eat more at the same time?

2574
04:58:02,290 --> 04:58:03,009
Where do I start?

2575
04:58:03,009 --> 04:58:03,490
Thanks a lot.

2576
04:58:08,279 --> 04:58:15,250
Um, depending on how, honestly, you just have to eat well.

2577
04:58:15,810 --> 04:58:17,750
You have to eat a lot of protein.

2578
04:58:17,750 --> 04:58:20,389
You have to take in a lot of protein and take in a lot of good fats.

2579
04:58:22,799 --> 04:58:27,279
Don't just eat McDonald's and Papa Gino's and Burger King and shit.

2580
04:58:27,279 --> 04:58:32,740
And you'll get, yeah, you'll gain weight, all of it in your ass and in your stomach

2581
04:58:32,740 --> 04:58:34,099
and maybe a little bit on your face.

2582
04:58:34,099 --> 04:58:40,799
The rest of you won't get anything.

2583
04:58:40,799 --> 04:58:47,159
You need to eat quality protein, quality food, high calorie foods

2584
04:58:48,549 --> 04:58:49,590
that aren't junk.

2585
04:58:53,909 --> 04:58:54,790
Eat good fats.

2586
04:58:55,779 --> 04:58:57,750
That's like peanut butter.

2587
04:58:57,750 --> 04:59:07,619
That's like different oils, like olive oil, cans of tuna straight out of the can.

2588
04:59:07,619 --> 04:59:08,580
That's what I did.

2589
04:59:08,580 --> 04:59:09,700
But I'm crazy.

2590
04:59:10,500 --> 04:59:16,209
Don't like do the shit that I did.

2591
04:59:16,209 --> 04:59:19,729
If you want, I like, I can't give you like advice that a doctor would give you.

2592
04:59:19,729 --> 04:59:23,990
That's like actually good advice because if I told my doctor that I was eating

2593
04:59:23,990 --> 04:59:27,599
like two or three cans of tuna a day, they'd probably be like,

2594
04:59:27,599 --> 04:59:28,319
why, what are you doing?

2595
04:59:28,319 --> 04:59:28,959
Don't do that.

2596
04:59:28,959 --> 04:59:30,000
That's terrible.

2597
04:59:30,000 --> 04:59:37,669
And I'd be like, well, I had to get big.

2598
04:59:37,669 --> 04:59:40,549
The reason why I ate a lot of tuna fish is because it's cheap.

2599
04:59:40,549 --> 04:59:46,979
Because if you need to eat a lot of food, you know, it can get expensive,

2600
04:59:46,979 --> 04:59:51,029
especially if you eat, you know, if you're trying to take in more than 2,

2601
04:59:51,029 --> 04:59:56,869
300, like 2,500 calories a day that you're trying to work off and like build muscle,

2602
04:59:56,869 --> 04:59:58,180
it can get expensive.

2603
05:00:05,270 --> 05:00:07,909
Don't get mercury poisoning from eating straight tuna for three weeks.

2604
05:00:07,909 --> 05:00:08,630
That's what I'm telling you.

2605
05:00:08,630 --> 05:00:09,270
Don't listen to me.

2606
05:00:18,069 --> 05:00:20,470
Just eat good food and eat.

2607
05:00:21,349 --> 05:00:23,909
Don't just eat one or two times a day like everybody does.

2608
05:00:25,430 --> 05:00:26,310
You should be eating.

2609
05:00:26,950 --> 05:00:29,750
You should be constantly giving your body energy.

2610
05:00:31,250 --> 05:00:34,209
So that's not two huge meals a day.

2611
05:00:34,930 --> 05:00:39,810
That's four, five, six small meals over the course of the day.

2612
05:00:39,810 --> 05:00:51,560
It's actually much better for you to eat smaller meals than huge ones.

2613
05:00:54,400 --> 05:00:55,680
Constant energy.

2614
05:00:55,680 --> 05:00:56,639
Drink lots of water.

2615
05:00:59,330 --> 05:01:01,569
Guys, you shouldn't be listening to me ever because I...

2616
05:01:02,689 --> 05:01:04,529
Okay, I'm going to say something here and then people are going to be like,

2617
05:01:04,529 --> 05:01:05,810
you're fucking insane.

2618
05:01:05,810 --> 05:01:06,529
All right, I know.

2619
05:01:07,250 --> 05:01:09,009
But listen to me.

2620
05:01:09,009 --> 05:01:09,650
Are you listening?

2621
05:01:09,650 --> 05:01:10,049
Listen to me.

2622
05:01:10,049 --> 05:01:10,450
You know what I mean?

2623
05:01:11,250 --> 05:01:11,729
Listen to me.

2624
05:01:11,729 --> 05:01:12,450
Listen to me about this.

2625
05:01:12,450 --> 05:01:12,930
You know what I'm saying?

2626
05:01:13,810 --> 05:01:19,189
I used to just eat out of the jar tahini paste

2627
05:01:20,259 --> 05:01:23,299
because it's the most calorie dense food on earth.

2628
05:01:29,680 --> 05:01:35,569
One tablespoon of tahini paste is 89 calories.

2629
05:01:39,830 --> 05:01:41,430
Like Winnie the Pooh.

2630
05:01:54,450 --> 05:01:58,610
But tahini, it's so calorie dense.

2631
05:01:58,610 --> 05:02:00,369
It's sesame seeds.

2632
05:02:00,369 --> 05:02:03,729
Tahini is ground up sesame seeds.

2633
05:02:03,729 --> 05:02:05,889
Toasted ground hulled sesame.

2634
05:02:07,270 --> 05:02:14,689
It's the most calorie dense food in the world.

2635
05:02:14,689 --> 05:02:15,810
It's like peanut butter.

2636
05:02:16,450 --> 05:02:18,529
If peanut butter took out all like the...

2637
05:02:19,959 --> 05:02:21,319
It's good for you.

2638
05:02:21,319 --> 05:02:22,360
Tahini is good for you.

2639
05:02:22,360 --> 05:02:24,200
Just not a jar of it.

2640
05:02:24,200 --> 05:02:28,290
It's got polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats.

2641
05:02:28,290 --> 05:02:29,569
It's got no cholesterol.

2642
05:02:32,900 --> 05:02:34,099
It's just don't eat a jar of it.

2643
05:02:34,099 --> 05:02:35,060
But don't listen to me.

2644
05:02:35,700 --> 05:02:36,340
I'm wrong.

2645
05:02:36,340 --> 05:02:37,060
And I know I am.

2646
05:02:37,619 --> 05:02:43,270
But I was putting tahini paste in place of stuff like mayonnaise.

2647
05:02:43,270 --> 05:02:45,590
Like if I made a sandwich like, you know,

2648
05:02:45,590 --> 05:02:48,389
sandwich with a lettuce, tomato, a little bit of onion,

2649
05:02:48,389 --> 05:02:52,950
some like deli turkey, a slice of cheese, tahini paste.

2650
05:02:54,000 --> 05:02:56,560
Because it was going to add like 200 calories to the meal.

2651
05:02:56,560 --> 05:03:01,189
What do you mean this keeps getting worse?

2652
05:03:01,189 --> 05:03:02,630
Are you eating a turkey sandwich is bad?

2653
05:03:02,630 --> 05:03:03,590
What are you talking about?

2654
05:03:03,590 --> 05:03:17,119
How have I not gotten diabetes from these foods?

2655
05:03:17,119 --> 05:03:19,479
There's like no sugar in tahini.

2656
05:03:21,569 --> 05:03:22,369
There's nothing...

2657
05:03:22,369 --> 05:03:23,090
Tahini is good.

2658
05:03:23,729 --> 05:03:25,090
Tahini is not bad for you.

2659
05:03:27,540 --> 05:03:28,979
Tahini, tahini three more times.

2660
05:03:28,979 --> 05:03:30,180
Tahini, tahini.

2661
05:03:30,180 --> 05:03:32,360
Hummus is another one, yeah.

2662
05:03:42,200 --> 05:03:43,000
Eggs, yep.

2663
05:03:44,659 --> 05:03:45,860
Guys, everything is bad.

2664
05:03:47,000 --> 05:03:49,919
Everything is bad for you.

2665
05:03:49,919 --> 05:03:51,040
If you eat a shitload of eggs,

2666
05:03:51,040 --> 05:03:53,599
your cholesterol is going to go skyrocketing.

2667
05:03:53,599 --> 05:03:55,779
You eat a shitload of fucking fish,

2668
05:03:55,779 --> 05:03:56,900
you're going to get mercury poisoning.

2669
05:03:57,540 --> 05:04:00,450
You eat a bunch of steak, you're going to get fat.

2670
05:04:02,529 --> 05:04:03,889
Everything sucks.

2671
05:04:03,889 --> 05:04:10,529
Just mix them all together and eat it like five times a day.

2672
05:04:12,040 --> 05:04:12,520
Slowly.

2673
05:04:16,599 --> 05:04:17,799
Just dump a beer in there too.

2674
05:04:18,439 --> 05:04:18,919
And blend.

2675
05:04:27,650 --> 05:04:30,209
No, honestly without fucking around and no jokes and everything,

2676
05:04:30,209 --> 05:04:31,490
the best advice I can give you is

2677
05:04:32,919 --> 05:04:35,720
eat high quality food more often.

2678
05:04:36,869 --> 05:04:39,509
Don't just get fat to burn it off

2679
05:04:39,509 --> 05:04:43,750
because burning fat is actually way harder than building muscle.

2680
05:04:43,750 --> 05:04:45,830
Sometimes you just won't get rid of it.

2681
05:04:45,830 --> 05:04:47,110
It'll just be there for life.

2682
05:04:52,950 --> 05:04:53,990
Just don't get fat.

2683
05:04:55,880 --> 05:04:56,919
I'm not a dietician.

2684
05:04:56,919 --> 05:04:58,919
I just told you I put tahini paste on everything.

2685
05:05:01,680 --> 05:05:03,759
She would probably monk a ass when you told her that.

2686
05:05:06,310 --> 05:05:10,950
And yes, I said her because my nutritionist was...

2687
05:05:12,310 --> 05:05:14,549
I'm like bringing up people in my life.

2688
05:05:15,270 --> 05:05:22,419
I'm like going through people in my life right now.

2689
05:05:23,139 --> 05:05:25,779
Nutritionists, the people that like helped me do things.

2690
05:05:37,240 --> 05:05:38,360
No, don't eat tahini.

2691
05:05:38,360 --> 05:05:39,240
I never said that.

2692
05:05:39,240 --> 05:05:40,200
It's don't do that.

2693
05:05:41,220 --> 05:05:41,860
Cut the music.

2694
05:05:44,639 --> 05:05:47,430
You should be doing a balanced diet.

2695
05:05:47,430 --> 05:05:52,310
Don't put tahini paste, like a bunch of it on your sandwich.

2696
05:05:53,040 --> 05:05:55,279
It's a bad idea.

2697
05:05:55,439 --> 05:05:57,349
All right, good.

2698
05:05:57,349 --> 05:05:57,990
Don't do that.

2699
05:05:58,549 --> 05:06:01,029
Eat some peanut butter on a sandwich toast.

2700
05:06:01,029 --> 05:06:02,919
That's what I used to do before bed.

2701
05:06:02,919 --> 05:06:07,159
I would spread peanut butter onto a piece of just regular toast,

2702
05:06:07,159 --> 05:06:07,880
like a good amount of it,

2703
05:06:07,880 --> 05:06:11,650
and I would eat that for a late night snack.

2704
05:06:11,650 --> 05:06:12,610
Peanut butter is very dense.

2705
05:06:12,610 --> 05:06:16,020
It's very heavy, very calorie dense, but very good for you.

2706
05:06:16,020 --> 05:06:21,590
Get the real stuff.

2707
05:06:21,590 --> 05:06:23,029
Does tahini paste taste good?

2708
05:06:23,029 --> 05:06:24,659
No.

2709
05:06:24,659 --> 05:06:26,580
In hummus, when it's mixed together with stuff, yeah.

2710
05:06:26,580 --> 05:06:30,340
It's just very, very, very thick and very, very, very distinctive.

2711
05:06:30,340 --> 05:06:33,840
It almost like coats your whole mouth and throat.

2712
05:06:33,840 --> 05:06:43,409
It's hard to eat.

2713
05:06:43,409 --> 05:06:44,770
Anyways, good luck to you.

2714
05:06:44,770 --> 05:06:47,509
Seriously, I had a lot of trouble when I was younger,

2715
05:06:47,509 --> 05:06:50,389
10, 15 plus years ago, trying to put on weight.

2716
05:06:50,389 --> 05:06:52,419
It's a never-ending battle.

2717
05:06:52,419 --> 05:06:55,680
Just don't do anything unhealthy,

2718
05:06:55,680 --> 05:06:58,240
because you'll cause more problems than you will fix.

2719
05:06:58,240 --> 05:07:03,459
I wish you luck.

2720
05:07:03,459 --> 05:07:05,860
Hey, Large27, thanks for the thousand bits.

2721
05:07:05,860 --> 05:07:07,540
No message, just 10 bucks.

2722
05:07:07,540 --> 05:07:10,659
Thank you.

2723
05:07:10,659 --> 05:07:14,259
Dino Pulse, thanks for the five hundred bits.

2724
05:07:14,259 --> 05:07:17,860
Can you explain the breaking spamming rules problem that chat has?

2725
05:07:17,860 --> 05:07:19,860
They are acting like a hive mind,

2726
05:07:19,860 --> 05:07:22,900
and that's why the art's been depicting them like robots.

2727
05:07:22,900 --> 05:07:24,020
Some of us are human here.

2728
05:07:24,020 --> 05:07:26,979
Not to be rude, just wishing us people in chat

2729
05:07:26,979 --> 05:07:29,299
would have a much more organic relationship with you, Jerma,

2730
05:07:29,299 --> 05:07:30,180
like other streamers.

2731
05:07:37,729 --> 05:07:50,119
What do you mean?

2732
05:07:50,119 --> 05:07:51,319
Organic relationship?

2733
05:07:54,119 --> 05:07:57,159
It's hard to have an organic relationship with anybody

2734
05:07:58,470 --> 05:08:01,909
when thousands of people are all saying different things at the same time.

2735
05:08:09,349 --> 05:08:10,790
Assimilate the thinker.

2736
05:08:11,189 --> 05:08:25,220
I think it's fun when chat kind of goes off the rails.

2737
05:08:27,840 --> 05:08:30,639
It's fun to see the collective unit doing things.

2738
05:08:31,200 --> 05:08:40,240
But in regards to chat to broadcaster to back to viewer,

2739
05:08:40,959 --> 05:08:44,439
there's a lot of people here.

2740
05:08:46,150 --> 05:08:52,790
So there's, I don't know what you mean by organic relationship.

2741
05:08:53,349 --> 05:08:56,080
Uh oh, stinky.

2742
05:08:56,639 --> 05:09:01,279
Why are you guys still writing this?

2743
05:09:01,279 --> 05:09:02,560
It's been like two hours.

2744
05:09:05,959 --> 05:09:10,200
No, I like to enjoy things as a group on Twitch.

2745
05:09:11,799 --> 05:09:14,599
And sure, when I do things like these community nights,

2746
05:09:15,479 --> 05:09:19,720
we're showcasing single people that make something or do something,

2747
05:09:20,360 --> 05:09:22,279
but we all collectively enjoy it as a group.

2748
05:09:24,000 --> 05:09:28,560
It's like impossible for me to ever give anybody like personal attention.

2749
05:09:30,049 --> 05:09:32,450
I'm not sure if this is where you're going with this at all,

2750
05:09:32,450 --> 05:09:35,700
but I prefer it that way.

2751
05:09:36,259 --> 05:09:38,049
This is a meme?

2752
05:09:45,220 --> 05:09:46,180
No, no, no, no, no.

2753
05:09:49,240 --> 05:09:52,439
I like it when we all enjoy things together as a group.

2754
05:09:54,790 --> 05:09:58,470
Because when you start trying to give personal attention

2755
05:09:58,470 --> 05:10:01,110
to people that are in chat or in the Discord,

2756
05:10:02,680 --> 05:10:03,560
it's hard to keep up.

2757
05:10:06,560 --> 05:10:09,200
And I've been guilty of doing stuff like this before,

2758
05:10:09,200 --> 05:10:11,520
trying to talk to people and see what's up with this

2759
05:10:11,520 --> 05:10:12,319
and what's up with that.

2760
05:10:12,319 --> 05:10:16,840
And you kind of get lost because there's a lot of voices.

2761
05:10:22,020 --> 05:10:24,580
So I like to keep my stream.

2762
05:10:25,540 --> 05:10:28,340
Like we're all just sitting in a giant auditorium,

2763
05:10:28,900 --> 05:10:30,180
laughing at stuff.

2764
05:10:30,180 --> 05:10:32,319
And then when the lights go off,

2765
05:10:32,880 --> 05:10:34,790
I put up a giant megaphone that says,

2766
05:10:35,430 --> 05:10:36,470
everybody go home.

2767
05:10:37,029 --> 05:10:40,709
Somebody might throw something at me.

2768
05:10:40,709 --> 05:10:43,040
And it's like, hey, fucking asshole.

2769
05:10:43,040 --> 05:10:44,319
And then they run out the back.

2770
05:10:45,040 --> 05:10:52,659
But I like enjoying things as a group.

2771
05:10:53,299 --> 05:10:58,180
Personal attention can get, it can get muddy,

2772
05:10:58,740 --> 05:11:01,540
especially because considering I don't really know

2773
05:11:03,439 --> 05:11:07,029
really, like really any of you.

2774
05:11:07,590 --> 05:11:10,979
Maybe some of you.

2775
05:11:10,979 --> 05:11:13,299
I like the Borg approach.

2776
05:11:19,220 --> 05:11:21,380
I've met some of you guys in person.

2777
05:11:25,520 --> 05:11:28,080
Personal attention in parasocial relationships is scary.

2778
05:11:28,639 --> 05:11:33,080
Yeah, I just want to keep expectations

2779
05:11:33,080 --> 05:11:34,599
completely where I want them.

2780
05:11:35,400 --> 05:11:37,319
And that's auditorium full of people

2781
05:11:37,319 --> 05:11:39,319
that are collectively all in the same place

2782
05:11:39,319 --> 05:11:40,279
enjoying the same things.

2783
05:11:48,689 --> 05:11:49,189
Robots.

2784
05:11:50,849 --> 05:11:52,369
So I was at Target today.

2785
05:11:52,610 --> 05:12:00,400
I love each and every one of you as the unit.

2786
05:12:00,959 --> 05:12:03,540
Look, you ever seen the movie?

2787
05:12:03,540 --> 05:12:05,540
Okay, we're going to go on a movie rant here.

2788
05:12:06,099 --> 05:12:09,240
Okay, God.

2789
05:12:09,880 --> 05:12:20,400
Now, I hope you guys understand what I mean.

2790
05:12:21,040 --> 05:12:29,119
I love the community, but I like to keep it

2791
05:12:29,119 --> 05:12:30,639
an open, fun community.

2792
05:12:31,439 --> 05:12:35,000
I would never, I'm probably never going to be

2793
05:12:35,000 --> 05:12:36,520
in one of those scenarios where I will,

2794
05:12:37,319 --> 05:12:39,729
because sometimes people say, hey, like,

2795
05:12:39,729 --> 05:12:42,689
you know, then this is nothing against anybody at all.

2796
05:12:43,250 --> 05:12:45,270
You know, people be like, hey, I'll be,

2797
05:12:46,150 --> 05:12:46,869
I'll be at X.

2798
05:12:46,869 --> 05:12:47,830
Are you going to be there too?

2799
05:12:48,630 --> 05:12:50,549
And it's like, I probably not.

2800
05:13:01,400 --> 05:13:01,880
Meetups.

2801
05:13:01,880 --> 05:13:03,240
Oh, no, that's completely different though,

2802
05:13:03,240 --> 05:13:06,340
because that's, you know, hey, this is something

2803
05:13:06,340 --> 05:13:10,659
that I want us to do at this event and go.

2804
05:13:15,619 --> 05:13:16,580
Find toothpick.

2805
05:13:16,580 --> 05:13:19,139
Yeah. And if you look, there's been plenty of people.

2806
05:13:20,560 --> 05:13:22,479
And I've recently too, this is not just

2807
05:13:23,279 --> 05:13:24,959
something that happened like years ago.

2808
05:13:25,599 --> 05:13:28,880
Within the last six months, people have just kind of

2809
05:13:28,880 --> 05:13:30,479
flagged me down in random places.

2810
05:13:31,810 --> 05:13:33,970
Has nothing to do with being on stream or anything.

2811
05:13:33,970 --> 05:13:35,090
And not like a gaming event.

2812
05:13:35,090 --> 05:13:38,159
It's just like, hi, I'm going to talk to you.

2813
05:13:38,159 --> 05:13:39,840
Or like, I'm going to hang out and I'll talk to you.

2814
05:13:42,020 --> 05:13:44,259
So this is not anything to do above that.

2815
05:13:46,389 --> 05:13:47,110
Vegas is huge.

2816
05:13:47,110 --> 05:13:51,380
Oh yeah. It's way bigger than like the Boston area

2817
05:13:52,020 --> 05:13:54,819
in regards to just pure volume and places to go

2818
05:13:54,819 --> 05:13:56,419
and where you can run into people.

2819
05:13:59,409 --> 05:14:04,419
But I like the madness in chat to answer that question.

2820
05:14:09,090 --> 05:14:13,810
To a degree, to a degree.

2821
05:14:13,810 --> 05:14:21,889
I'm happy that fame hasn't consumed you.

2822
05:14:24,389 --> 05:14:25,430
I think I'm incapable.

2823
05:14:25,990 --> 05:14:31,490
I think I might just be dumb enough to like

2824
05:14:31,490 --> 05:14:33,090
not be capable of that.

2825
05:14:33,090 --> 05:14:36,400
Like the sensor of my brain that could like turn that on.

2826
05:14:37,119 --> 05:14:39,520
I don't think it's worked since I was like fucking 19.

2827
05:14:40,159 --> 05:14:49,830
He's got a really low IQ.

2828
05:14:51,009 --> 05:14:53,009
He always was an egomaniac.

2829
05:14:58,580 --> 05:14:59,700
He's a karate kid.

2830
05:14:59,700 --> 05:15:00,659
That's right.

2831
05:15:00,659 --> 05:15:01,619
It all turned off.

2832
05:15:08,849 --> 05:15:09,729
I'd love to meet him.

2833
05:15:09,729 --> 05:15:10,689
I'd love to meet you too.

2834
05:15:11,909 --> 05:15:12,790
It'd be great.

2835
05:15:12,790 --> 05:15:13,909
I'm sure it would be really fun.

2836
05:15:15,139 --> 05:15:17,139
But I ain't going to give out my personal phone number.

2837
05:15:26,279 --> 05:15:28,209
Why? I don't know.

2838
05:15:28,930 --> 05:15:30,209
Anyways, let's keep going.

2839
05:15:30,209 --> 05:15:30,849
Not too much more.

2840
05:15:30,849 --> 05:15:32,290
We have demoniccucumber250.

2841
05:15:32,290 --> 05:15:34,369
You should take italics or Kim with you

2842
05:15:34,369 --> 05:15:35,490
for the next green screen stream

2843
05:15:35,490 --> 05:15:37,169
and get some double clips for these streams.

2844
05:15:37,729 --> 05:15:41,110
I was going to bring in a bunch of random stuff,

2845
05:15:42,659 --> 05:15:45,060
but I kind of, I kind of, it's just,

2846
05:15:45,060 --> 05:15:46,180
I think I want just to be me.

2847
05:15:50,720 --> 05:15:53,439
Plus Kim is not, she wouldn't want to do that.

2848
05:16:00,639 --> 05:16:02,799
Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego.

2849
05:16:02,799 --> 05:16:03,360
There it is again.

2850
05:16:03,360 --> 05:16:03,840
There it is again.

2851
05:16:03,840 --> 05:16:04,319
There it is again.

2852
05:16:04,319 --> 05:16:04,959
There's the ego.

2853
05:16:05,439 --> 05:16:08,709
It's going to be me and my props like Carrot Top.

2854
05:16:20,069 --> 05:16:21,990
You know why I want to do it alone?

2855
05:16:21,990 --> 05:16:22,869
Here's the reason why.

2856
05:16:24,000 --> 05:16:26,799
Because there's something about being in a silent room

2857
05:16:27,759 --> 05:16:30,000
alone with a solo camera and a green screen.

2858
05:16:31,540 --> 05:16:33,299
It's, it's, it's weird.

2859
05:16:33,299 --> 05:16:34,099
I like it though.

2860
05:16:36,200 --> 05:16:38,599
It's oddly calming and interesting.

2861
05:16:39,240 --> 05:16:41,189
And then I have like the chat right there.

2862
05:16:42,209 --> 05:16:43,409
It's really, really interesting.

2863
05:16:50,900 --> 05:16:52,580
I got to get that germa psycho emote

2864
05:16:52,580 --> 05:16:54,979
because I don't even have a germa psycho emote

2865
05:16:55,619 --> 05:16:58,900
and it's used more than half the emotes on stream.

2866
05:17:06,479 --> 05:17:08,479
Thank you large for the 500 bits.

2867
05:17:09,200 --> 05:17:11,200
No message, just five bucks.

2868
05:17:11,200 --> 05:17:11,520
Thank you.

2869
05:17:14,319 --> 05:17:20,560
I want to get the, well, not quite yet.

2870
05:17:20,560 --> 05:17:22,240
Hey iPod, Matt, thanks for the 250.

2871
05:17:22,240 --> 05:17:24,319
Terma, every time someone says peepee poopoo in chat,

2872
05:17:24,319 --> 05:17:26,639
it reminds me of my dog Buster.

2873
05:17:27,279 --> 05:17:29,279
Instead of asking him if he wants to go for a walk,

2874
05:17:29,279 --> 05:17:31,360
I've always said, do you have to go peepee poopoo?

2875
05:17:40,119 --> 05:17:41,240
Everybody talks like that.

2876
05:17:47,110 --> 05:17:49,349
This is a really, really, really, really cute dog.

2877
05:17:50,069 --> 05:17:52,560
We always show dogs on the stream.

2878
05:17:52,560 --> 05:17:55,459
It's, it's, it's required reading.

2879
05:17:56,099 --> 05:18:13,119
Why is it upside down?

2880
05:18:15,810 --> 05:18:20,930
Uh, oh, there we go.

2881
05:18:20,930 --> 05:18:29,680
Look it, dogs are the best.

2882
05:18:30,400 --> 05:18:35,430
Beautiful dog.

2883
05:18:35,990 --> 05:18:43,430
We had those 40 community subs from Shazo.

2884
05:18:45,000 --> 05:18:49,830
Thank you Shazo, again, for your 40 subs.

2885
05:18:49,830 --> 05:18:50,869
That's a shitload.

2886
05:18:51,509 --> 05:18:57,360
We also had, uh, another 1500 bits from large

2887
05:18:57,360 --> 05:18:58,799
who has a message this time.

2888
05:18:59,360 --> 05:19:03,680
Thank you large for your multiple bit drops here.

2889
05:19:03,680 --> 05:19:05,360
Germa, long time fan, but pretty new to the stream.

2890
05:19:05,919 --> 05:19:08,080
Only been able to catch a couple here and there.

2891
05:19:08,080 --> 05:19:11,119
Usually watch Germa's second and the stream archives.

2892
05:19:11,119 --> 05:19:12,560
But I always wanted to send some support

2893
05:19:12,560 --> 05:19:14,400
and tell you how much you've made me laugh over the years.

2894
05:19:14,400 --> 05:19:16,080
Thank you for being my favorite content creator.

2895
05:19:16,080 --> 05:19:16,400
Thank you.

2896
05:19:17,759 --> 05:19:18,560
My pleasure.

2897
05:19:19,360 --> 05:19:24,099
Thank you large.

2898
05:19:27,939 --> 05:19:29,700
Uh, glad to have you on stream this time.

2899
05:19:30,340 --> 05:19:32,159
Thanks for coming and checking it out.

2900
05:19:32,799 --> 05:19:36,450
Thank you.

2901
05:19:37,090 --> 05:19:44,610
Thank you Pigeon for the 250 bits.

2902
05:19:44,610 --> 05:19:45,729
Terma, I don't know if this is intentional,

2903
05:19:45,729 --> 05:19:47,009
but I posted my friend's video

2904
05:19:47,009 --> 05:19:48,849
between the SCP Scary Discord one

2905
05:19:48,849 --> 05:19:50,369
and the Rap You're So Precious one.

2906
05:19:50,930 --> 05:19:52,369
If you did this intentionally, I understand.

2907
05:19:52,369 --> 05:19:53,330
But if not, here it is.

2908
05:19:54,450 --> 05:19:55,810
Um, it's because this is on Twitter.

2909
05:19:59,959 --> 05:20:02,840
Uh, Twitter videos is kind of annoying to show on stream.

2910
05:20:05,590 --> 05:20:08,630
So make sure you follow the rules.

2911
05:20:08,630 --> 05:20:12,639
The rules say YouTube or Imgur.

2912
05:20:13,599 --> 05:20:15,680
YouTube, YouTube, Imgur, Imgur.

2913
05:20:16,560 --> 05:20:22,450
Twitter is really, really annoying

2914
05:20:22,450 --> 05:20:23,569
to actually like screen cap

2915
05:20:23,569 --> 05:20:26,049
because it starts off as this tiny little box

2916
05:20:26,049 --> 05:20:27,169
on the person's page.

2917
05:20:27,810 --> 05:20:29,009
And then if you try to make it bigger,

2918
05:20:29,009 --> 05:20:30,450
it takes up the whole screen.

2919
05:20:30,450 --> 05:20:35,680
The Twitter player is, uh, not so good.

2920
05:20:36,319 --> 05:20:42,049
Yeah, and Twitter autoplay.

2921
05:20:42,049 --> 05:20:43,090
It's just, yeah, yeah.

2922
05:20:43,810 --> 05:20:45,970
Imgur, YouTube, or in Discord

2923
05:20:45,970 --> 05:20:49,860
because 99% of the time,

2924
05:20:49,860 --> 05:20:50,979
I'd say just get it on YouTube.

2925
05:20:53,380 --> 05:20:55,459
It's much easier to cycle through YouTube

2926
05:20:55,459 --> 05:20:56,740
and have like a YouTube list

2927
05:20:56,740 --> 05:20:58,740
than it is to have YouTube, YouTube,

2928
05:20:58,740 --> 05:21:00,020
YouTube, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter,

2929
05:21:00,020 --> 05:21:01,060
YouTube, Twitter, Twitter.

2930
05:21:01,779 --> 05:21:04,659
It just, the format that I have

2931
05:21:04,659 --> 05:21:05,860
when I am tabbing through,

2932
05:21:06,819 --> 05:21:08,580
it's so much easier for me

2933
05:21:08,580 --> 05:21:10,020
just to have them on YouTube and Imgur.

2934
05:21:12,400 --> 05:21:13,680
So that's why.

2935
05:21:14,240 --> 05:21:17,439
And some videos that were uploaded to Twitter

2936
05:21:17,439 --> 05:21:19,520
actually had a second mirror that was YouTube

2937
05:21:19,520 --> 05:21:20,560
and that's the one that I used.

2938
05:21:31,509 --> 05:21:34,630
Thank you Piff Flavor for the 500 bits.

2939
05:21:35,430 --> 05:21:36,790
Germans want to give you money

2940
05:21:36,790 --> 05:21:40,310
and say that now 46.3% of my net income

2941
05:21:40,310 --> 05:21:41,669
is going to you.

2942
05:21:41,669 --> 05:21:42,790
Thanks, you thief.

2943
05:21:43,750 --> 05:21:48,659
Why are you giving me 46% of your income?

2944
05:21:53,169 --> 05:21:54,610
Shave the first number off of that.

2945
05:21:58,130 --> 05:21:59,569
And then I'd still be like,

2946
05:21:59,569 --> 05:22:01,729
well, you're giving me that much of your income.

2947
05:22:02,610 --> 05:22:08,450
He wants 6% of all your income.

2948
05:22:11,490 --> 05:22:13,729
No, I just said even that would be like,

2949
05:22:13,729 --> 05:22:14,689
what the hell's going on?

2950
05:22:18,369 --> 05:22:21,009
It's the 6% Jerma tax.

2951
05:22:21,009 --> 05:22:24,630
Jesus.

2952
05:22:27,779 --> 05:22:30,180
Hey, Jay Bong, thanks for the 250.

2953
05:22:30,180 --> 05:22:33,860
Appreciate it.

2954
05:22:35,970 --> 05:22:37,810
Jerma, you skipped over content I made.

2955
05:22:40,389 --> 05:22:42,150
Also, five or six things were skipped over.

2956
05:22:42,150 --> 05:22:42,790
Get it together.

2957
05:22:43,590 --> 05:22:44,599
Here's the thing.

2958
05:22:47,040 --> 05:22:49,200
When I'm compiling this stuff,

2959
05:22:50,080 --> 05:22:51,759
some things are going to get left through the cracks.

2960
05:22:57,139 --> 05:22:58,979
And whether it's something that I was like,

2961
05:22:58,979 --> 05:23:00,979
I want to show this or maybe I'll put it somewhere else.

2962
05:23:00,979 --> 05:23:02,020
Maybe I'll try this at the end.

2963
05:23:02,020 --> 05:23:02,979
Maybe I'll try this here.

2964
05:23:07,700 --> 05:23:10,340
Not everything that's uploaded to the Discord channel

2965
05:23:10,340 --> 05:23:11,540
is going to be shown on stream.

2966
05:23:12,259 --> 05:23:13,619
It's not as simple as,

2967
05:23:13,619 --> 05:23:15,779
oh, there were 425 images.

2968
05:23:15,779 --> 05:23:18,900
So 425 images are going to be shown on stream.

2969
05:23:18,900 --> 05:23:25,459
I'm kind of just trying to compile them

2970
05:23:25,459 --> 05:23:28,340
and put them in if I have this or too many of these.

2971
05:23:29,380 --> 05:23:34,340
Because remember, I do want these streams

2972
05:23:34,340 --> 05:23:36,500
to still stick in that, you know,

2973
05:23:36,500 --> 05:23:40,979
three to four, five, you know, plus four plus hours.

2974
05:23:42,450 --> 05:23:44,290
So just because it is put in that channel

2975
05:23:44,290 --> 05:23:46,209
does not mean it's going to be shown on stream.

2976
05:23:46,209 --> 05:23:47,810
I actually should probably put that in the rules too.

2977
05:23:56,630 --> 05:23:57,830
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

2978
05:23:58,389 --> 05:24:01,759
Because the same thing for like the emote contest too.

2979
05:24:01,759 --> 05:24:04,319
It's just because somebody put an emote submission in

2980
05:24:04,319 --> 05:24:05,599
doesn't mean that I was going to show it.

2981
05:24:06,400 --> 05:24:09,720
And there's a potential for,

2982
05:24:09,720 --> 05:24:11,080
and this is something I thought

2983
05:24:11,080 --> 05:24:12,200
was probably going to happen with this too,

2984
05:24:12,200 --> 05:24:13,639
is people could get like annoyed

2985
05:24:14,279 --> 05:24:16,360
that their submission did not get put on stream.

2986
05:24:16,360 --> 05:24:17,880
But like I said, you have to realize,

2987
05:24:20,040 --> 05:24:21,479
I can't, it's not just going to be

2988
05:24:21,479 --> 05:24:23,799
every single submission is going to be put in.

2989
05:24:31,439 --> 05:24:33,040
A majority of them will.

2990
05:24:33,599 --> 05:24:36,340
Just not every single one.

2991
05:24:38,689 --> 05:24:40,130
Also time too.

2992
05:24:40,130 --> 05:24:42,209
Because when you see the stream go live

2993
05:24:42,209 --> 05:24:43,729
that has a community content title,

2994
05:24:45,270 --> 05:24:47,669
I'm taking all the submissions

2995
05:24:47,669 --> 05:24:49,349
from that period that I did last

2996
05:24:49,909 --> 05:24:51,909
to the day before the stream started.

2997
05:24:51,909 --> 05:24:53,349
So if you're like, oh, what happened?

2998
05:24:53,349 --> 05:24:54,310
What happened to my submission?

2999
05:24:54,310 --> 05:24:55,430
What the fuck is going on here?

3000
05:24:55,430 --> 05:24:56,470
I put this up today.

3001
05:24:57,029 --> 05:24:57,830
That's why.

3002
05:24:57,830 --> 05:24:59,509
It's because it's like the day before

3003
05:24:59,509 --> 05:25:01,110
so I can start to compile them.

3004
05:25:01,110 --> 05:25:07,299
More tidbits.

3005
05:25:07,860 --> 05:25:15,830
There should be a poll so we can select what he sees.

3006
05:25:16,389 --> 05:25:18,310
No, I'd rather just do it at my own discretion.

3007
05:25:19,189 --> 05:25:20,389
Because then you start, people,

3008
05:25:21,349 --> 05:25:23,189
there could be like community favorites

3009
05:25:23,189 --> 05:25:24,869
and people, stuff that I,

3010
05:25:24,869 --> 05:25:26,470
stuff that wouldn't be considered.

3011
05:25:26,470 --> 05:25:28,069
Wow, that's so good.

3012
05:25:28,069 --> 05:25:29,189
That's so incredible.

3013
05:25:30,150 --> 05:25:32,630
Or like, oh, that was really low effort.

3014
05:25:32,630 --> 05:25:34,389
A lot of the high effort ones would just be picked.

3015
05:25:35,509 --> 05:25:37,189
And then you would also end up

3016
05:25:37,189 --> 05:25:39,110
with a bunch of potential like meme videos

3017
05:25:39,110 --> 05:25:40,709
that would just get through

3018
05:25:40,709 --> 05:25:43,189
because somebody just wrote, oh, stinky.

3019
05:25:45,040 --> 05:25:45,360
Right.

3020
05:25:45,360 --> 05:25:47,040
But in the rules already,

3021
05:25:47,040 --> 05:25:48,959
it does say that it has to be at least,

3022
05:25:48,959 --> 05:25:50,560
it has to be related to the channel.

3023
05:25:52,599 --> 05:25:55,240
Like, oh, stinky makes no sense for me

3024
05:25:55,240 --> 05:25:56,680
to play on a community content night.

3025
05:25:57,080 --> 05:25:59,400
It just doesn't have anything to do with the channel.

3026
05:26:00,200 --> 05:26:02,229
It's just a video.

3027
05:26:02,950 --> 05:26:04,849
It even says, like, it's not like

3028
05:26:04,849 --> 05:26:06,130
I'm not gonna watch Gordon Ramsay

3029
05:26:06,130 --> 05:26:07,250
who says fuck off a hundred times.

3030
05:26:07,889 --> 05:26:15,000
That's community content.

3031
05:26:15,000 --> 05:26:17,880
No, telling me your favorite movie is Star Wars

3032
05:26:17,880 --> 05:26:21,330
is not community content.

3033
05:26:21,330 --> 05:26:23,409
Telling me your favorite video is the gnome video

3034
05:26:23,409 --> 05:26:29,700
is not community content.

3035
05:26:29,700 --> 05:26:32,819
It's like community-oriented content.

3036
05:26:34,919 --> 05:26:37,720
I have never mentioned one time on this stream

3037
05:26:37,720 --> 05:26:39,319
the uh-oh farting monkey.

3038
05:26:42,200 --> 05:26:45,319
The, there's just that it has no context.

3039
05:26:45,319 --> 05:26:48,840
Any game I've played, any stream, any, anything.

3040
05:26:51,169 --> 05:26:52,770
Well, I did, we did today.

3041
05:26:53,409 --> 05:26:54,930
So maybe it'll show up next time.

3042
05:27:03,430 --> 05:27:05,509
So it's only the community if it's about you.

3043
05:27:08,529 --> 05:27:10,689
No, it's just the farting monkey

3044
05:27:10,689 --> 05:27:13,490
has nothing to do with this, anybody in this community.

3045
05:27:15,060 --> 05:27:16,819
What does uh-oh stinky monkey

3046
05:27:16,819 --> 05:27:17,860
have to do with anybody here?

3047
05:27:19,380 --> 05:27:21,939
Other than somebody shared it to you on like Instagram.

3048
05:27:23,639 --> 05:27:23,880
What?

3049
05:27:28,099 --> 05:27:29,060
It's everything.

3050
05:27:29,060 --> 05:27:30,020
It's my life.

3051
05:27:30,580 --> 05:27:36,560
I gotta be careful

3052
05:27:36,560 --> 05:27:38,000
because now people are gonna start putting that

3053
05:27:38,000 --> 05:27:39,520
in their videos that they make.

3054
05:27:40,080 --> 05:27:49,619
It has to be about you and this channel.

3055
05:27:49,619 --> 05:27:53,220
And um, is this, is this like,

3056
05:27:53,860 --> 05:27:55,299
is this like German and the Blowfish

3057
05:27:55,299 --> 05:27:56,659
or is this German 985?

3058
05:27:56,659 --> 05:27:57,380
What's going on here?

3059
05:28:22,529 --> 05:28:23,569
He's a dictator.

3060
05:28:29,639 --> 05:28:33,880
No, long story short, this game content

3061
05:28:33,880 --> 05:28:35,799
that like we've played on this stream,

3062
05:28:36,759 --> 05:28:39,000
marine screen content, fan art.

3063
05:28:39,000 --> 05:28:42,439
Guys, originally, all right, hit the brakes for a second.

3064
05:28:42,439 --> 05:28:44,919
All of you guys that are talking smack to me.

3065
05:28:45,560 --> 05:28:49,720
This was originally gonna be a fan art section of my streams.

3066
05:28:52,000 --> 05:28:54,479
Any farting fucking poopoo smelly monkeys

3067
05:28:54,479 --> 05:28:55,439
in the fan art sections?

3068
05:28:56,000 --> 05:29:07,360
I expanded the fan art to do like green screen stuff

3069
05:29:07,360 --> 05:29:09,360
and like other community oriented videos.

3070
05:29:14,400 --> 05:29:16,560
All right, we're moving on, we're moving on.

3071
05:29:17,439 --> 05:29:21,200
Long story short, by my discretion

3072
05:29:21,200 --> 05:29:23,759
is what I'm gonna be picking to put on stream.

3073
05:29:23,759 --> 05:29:26,319
It has nothing to do with how bad or good content is.

3074
05:29:28,470 --> 05:29:30,389
Art is subjective anyways, that's right.

3075
05:29:35,110 --> 05:29:37,750
The fat germa was the uh-oh monkey, all right.

3076
05:29:40,049 --> 05:29:41,409
But it was a picture of me.

3077
05:29:42,819 --> 05:29:46,099
That's, it wasn't just the picture of the monkey.

3078
05:29:46,099 --> 05:29:48,340
They didn't, they didn't draw the monkey

3079
05:29:48,340 --> 05:29:49,220
and send it to me.

3080
05:29:49,220 --> 05:29:51,060
It'd be like, why is this monkey here?

3081
05:29:57,060 --> 05:29:59,799
All right, cease, cease.

3082
05:30:00,439 --> 05:30:11,240
Uh, thank you Flinzenberg for the thousand bits, appreciate it.

3083
05:30:11,799 --> 05:30:14,080
Germa really enjoyed this stream.

3084
05:30:14,080 --> 05:30:15,919
I just want to let you know that I've been watching your content

3085
05:30:15,919 --> 05:30:17,200
since your old TF2 days

3086
05:30:17,759 --> 05:30:19,360
and you're still the only person I'm subbed to.

3087
05:30:20,319 --> 05:30:25,439
Well, that's, how many of you guys only have like one sub on Twitch?

3088
05:30:34,319 --> 05:30:34,880
Is it me?

3089
05:30:35,599 --> 05:30:38,450
I saw somebody say me that's not subbed to me.

3090
05:30:39,250 --> 05:30:40,290
Who is it then?

3091
05:30:40,290 --> 05:30:44,130
Who are you subbed to that's not me?

3092
05:30:44,130 --> 05:30:58,150
Oh, I know who it is, Vinesauce.

3093
05:30:59,509 --> 05:31:01,349
All right, okay, I'll let that one slide.

3094
05:31:02,069 --> 05:31:02,470
Who else?

3095
05:31:03,270 --> 05:31:06,880
Star, I'll let that one slide too.

3096
05:31:13,860 --> 05:31:14,580
Grillmaster.

3097
05:31:14,580 --> 05:31:17,919
Now that's something I cannot, I cannot stand by.

3098
05:31:26,150 --> 05:31:29,509
You guys want to know like the 5,000 IQ play for me?

3099
05:31:30,310 --> 05:31:31,590
Make a Grillmaster account.

3100
05:31:32,549 --> 05:31:34,470
Have it be under my name and have subs on it.

3101
05:31:35,330 --> 05:31:37,810
So then people will sub to Grillmaster as like,

3102
05:31:37,810 --> 05:31:39,889
oh look, I'm subbing to Grillmaster instead of Germa.

3103
05:31:39,889 --> 05:31:51,720
Gotcha, I own that account.

3104
05:31:51,720 --> 05:31:56,119
Just play off of, hire like an actor to be Grillmaster

3105
05:31:56,119 --> 05:31:58,840
and stream and it's just like an actor that I've hired

3106
05:31:58,840 --> 05:32:00,520
and it just all funnels back to me.

3107
05:32:01,319 --> 05:32:07,380
That's a pretty good Disney strat, yeah.

3108
05:32:07,939 --> 05:32:14,180
So people would be like, oh yeah, fuck you Germa.

3109
05:32:14,180 --> 05:32:17,299
I subbed to Grillmaster and I'll be like, what, what, what?

3110
05:32:17,939 --> 05:32:18,659
Are you serious?

3111
05:32:18,659 --> 05:32:21,380
Get out, get out of here, you Grillmaster asshole.

3112
05:32:25,040 --> 05:32:31,139
And then other people will be like, yeah, let's go sub to Grillmaster.

3113
05:32:31,139 --> 05:32:33,619
Yeah, they'll get really pissed at about that.

3114
05:32:33,619 --> 05:32:45,669
They'll just be like, dude, are you seriously going to do that to me?

3115
05:32:46,470 --> 05:32:47,880
Get out of here.

3116
05:32:49,959 --> 05:32:51,159
Guys, this is bullshit.

3117
05:32:53,779 --> 05:33:10,229
Hey, speaking of people that give their hard earned money

3118
05:33:10,950 --> 05:33:14,229
that is never obligated to this stream all the time.

3119
05:33:15,430 --> 05:33:19,590
That allows me to live this fucking weird wild life.

3120
05:33:20,389 --> 05:33:21,590
Thank you, here they come.

3121
05:33:22,310 --> 05:33:29,380
And it's a shitload of people.

3122
05:33:29,380 --> 05:33:30,819
How many of you accidentally subbed to me

3123
05:33:30,819 --> 05:33:32,419
because you wanted to sub to Grillmaster, I wonder?

3124
05:33:37,169 --> 05:33:38,450
Thanks guys, seriously.

3125
05:33:43,189 --> 05:33:47,189
But thank you, that was Fleisenberg, or Flinzenberg for the thousand bits.

3126
05:33:49,840 --> 05:33:52,479
They said they've been watching for a long time since TF2.

3127
05:33:52,479 --> 05:33:53,680
Only person I'm subbed to.

3128
05:33:55,270 --> 05:33:57,590
And they also say, have you ever considered streaming the Wind Waker?

3129
05:33:59,959 --> 05:34:04,930
Maybe eventually we'll do a GameCube week or something.

3130
05:34:04,930 --> 05:34:08,209
Because there are a lot of good games for the GameCube that I passed up.

3131
05:34:08,930 --> 05:34:10,450
I have to play Mario Sunshine.

3132
05:34:11,169 --> 05:34:16,680
Holy shit, this is some actual legit classics I've never played.

3133
05:34:16,680 --> 05:34:19,889
Pikmin, I have to at least play.

3134
05:34:20,450 --> 05:34:23,650
Is me not playing Mario Sunshine on stream illegal?

3135
05:34:25,799 --> 05:34:28,040
Does hearing that out loud make you guys so angry

3136
05:34:28,040 --> 05:34:29,639
that it's against the law for me not to do it?

3137
05:34:37,060 --> 05:34:38,099
Put it on the list.

3138
05:34:38,099 --> 05:34:44,159
We'll probably do it eventually.

3139
05:34:46,979 --> 05:34:48,419
Hey, gnarly, thanks for the 250.

3140
05:34:48,419 --> 05:34:49,700
Another awesome community night.

3141
05:34:50,439 --> 05:34:52,040
There was so much cool shit the community made

3142
05:34:52,040 --> 05:34:53,080
and I can't wait for the next one.

3143
05:34:53,080 --> 05:34:56,599
I'll probably make more Soul Calibur VI characters for the next one.

3144
05:34:57,240 --> 05:34:58,040
Any requests?

3145
05:34:59,970 --> 05:35:10,639
Dr. Schmikeson, that's number one, for sure.

3146
05:35:15,029 --> 05:35:17,110
This emote, yeah, do the it's me emote.

3147
05:35:17,110 --> 05:35:17,990
That one would be good too.

3148
05:35:30,200 --> 05:35:32,040
We need him on the green screen.

3149
05:35:32,040 --> 05:35:33,959
That, now that's not possible.

3150
05:35:35,830 --> 05:35:36,630
I'm sorry to say.

3151
05:35:40,849 --> 05:35:43,090
Yeah, no, I love the stuff that people come up with.

3152
05:35:51,830 --> 05:35:56,310
You know what, maybe, oh, I will make people very bad.

3153
05:35:58,450 --> 05:36:02,529
What if Bugleberry is on that green screen for like a few minutes?

3154
05:36:03,250 --> 05:36:09,810
I gotta be careful though,

3155
05:36:09,810 --> 05:36:13,110
because I'm guaranteed to lose a thousand viewers or more.

3156
05:36:13,110 --> 05:36:16,479
It's all good, whatever.

3157
05:36:20,500 --> 05:36:30,020
With the reverb, I was, there's nothing I can even do about it now.

3158
05:36:30,020 --> 05:36:34,400
But thinking back on that, I was like, fuck, it's so loud.

3159
05:36:35,040 --> 05:36:40,319
But yeah, definitely Dr. Schmikeson.

3160
05:36:40,319 --> 05:36:51,830
Thank you doorkeeper the 250.

3161
05:36:51,830 --> 05:36:54,229
Did my video get lost or did the mods hate it?

3162
05:36:54,229 --> 05:36:57,169
It's not mods, it's me.

3163
05:36:58,049 --> 05:36:59,299
I didn't hate your video.

3164
05:36:59,299 --> 05:37:02,020
I didn't, but I'm just saying it's me that's making these decisions.

3165
05:37:02,659 --> 05:37:05,569
Based on a couple of internal factors.

3166
05:37:08,209 --> 05:37:10,209
No, that's, you're taking the words out of my mouth

3167
05:37:10,209 --> 05:37:12,689
and you're putting them in order the way that I said them

3168
05:37:13,409 --> 05:37:14,689
and adding hate on them.

3169
05:37:15,250 --> 05:37:20,919
No, like I said, I gotta put that in the rules.

3170
05:37:21,479 --> 05:37:24,919
That a submission does not mean it'll be on stream.

3171
05:37:24,919 --> 05:37:29,970
I think school's bill sucks.

3172
05:37:29,970 --> 05:37:33,090
It has nothing to do with videos being bad or video,

3173
05:37:33,090 --> 05:37:37,009
it's just trying to compile an equal amount of things.

3174
05:37:37,009 --> 05:37:42,200
And no, I'm not, I might hate your video.

3175
05:37:42,200 --> 05:37:43,319
That's not what it is.

3176
05:37:44,040 --> 05:37:48,340
Sometimes length or how long something is

3177
05:37:48,419 --> 05:37:51,779
or the content of the video, it could be anything.

3178
05:38:01,959 --> 05:38:02,919
Have you seen them all?

3179
05:38:04,200 --> 05:38:07,080
No, I don't watch the videos.

3180
05:38:07,080 --> 05:38:08,439
What I do is I open them.

3181
05:38:10,040 --> 05:38:11,720
I click, click, click.

3182
05:38:11,720 --> 05:38:12,520
Okay, hold on.

3183
05:38:12,520 --> 05:38:13,400
Let me see right there.

3184
05:38:15,029 --> 05:38:16,869
See the length, see the subject matter.

3185
05:38:20,500 --> 05:38:21,299
I go, what is this?

3186
05:38:24,099 --> 05:38:25,380
You judge the book by its cover.

3187
05:38:25,380 --> 05:38:29,590
Yeah, that's not how you guys read books.

3188
05:38:29,590 --> 05:38:30,709
I've read all the Lord of the Rings.

3189
05:38:30,709 --> 05:38:33,669
All I had to do is read the first fucking one page

3190
05:38:33,669 --> 05:38:34,470
on the back and the front.

3191
05:38:44,880 --> 05:38:47,919
Also something that I, okay, I'm gonna have to update the rules

3192
05:38:48,479 --> 05:38:53,360
because something that it's like, it's so subjective

3193
05:38:55,380 --> 05:38:58,770
that I have to update the rules

3194
05:38:59,569 --> 05:39:03,169
because a lot of submissions would come in

3195
05:39:03,169 --> 05:39:05,490
that would just like clips of the stream

3196
05:39:08,340 --> 05:39:10,340
or like clips of other people's streams.

3197
05:39:10,979 --> 05:39:18,869
Have mods filter?

3198
05:39:28,869 --> 05:39:31,110
I mean, they kind of already do in a way.

3199
05:39:31,110 --> 05:39:45,110
He's changing the rules for his benefit.

3200
05:39:45,750 --> 05:39:48,229
Well, also that's a lot of work too.

3201
05:39:49,270 --> 05:39:52,709
Hey, Marge compiled like fucking 400 videos for me

3202
05:39:52,709 --> 05:39:54,549
and like 200 pieces of artwork

3203
05:39:54,549 --> 05:39:55,590
and because they can't

3204
05:39:56,470 --> 05:39:58,069
because I have to show it on stream.

3205
05:39:58,630 --> 05:40:02,389
So they would have to make new playlists every month

3206
05:40:02,389 --> 05:40:06,150
and they'd have to give me like an Imgur file,

3207
05:40:06,150 --> 05:40:08,869
an Imgur album with hundreds of photos in it and stuff.

3208
05:40:08,869 --> 05:40:10,470
That's too much to ask somebody.

3209
05:40:11,680 --> 05:40:12,720
That's for me to do.

3210
05:40:13,439 --> 05:40:20,470
And they help a shitload for a lot of stuff

3211
05:40:20,470 --> 05:40:21,270
that you guys don't even know.

3212
05:40:21,909 --> 05:40:32,319
Dorky says, I understand and not everything be watched

3213
05:40:32,319 --> 05:40:34,240
but if I submit a video and you don't watch it

3214
05:40:34,240 --> 05:40:36,959
and I ask you why there's a variety of factors.

3215
05:40:39,939 --> 05:40:40,979
I'm just gonna update the rules

3216
05:40:43,299 --> 05:40:45,060
because right now it's,

3217
05:40:46,240 --> 05:40:48,400
I have it for under 10 minutes for videos

3218
05:40:49,200 --> 05:40:51,459
but it realistically should probably be under five.

3219
05:40:52,180 --> 05:40:54,770
And I think that was probably what the,

3220
05:40:55,409 --> 05:40:57,569
I think the video you uploaded was like five and a half minutes,

3221
05:40:57,569 --> 05:40:58,610
six minutes or something, right?

3222
05:41:00,740 --> 05:41:01,700
That's probably what it was.

3223
05:41:02,500 --> 05:41:07,599
Unless for like there,

3224
05:41:07,599 --> 05:41:10,639
because let me try to think of like some scenarios

3225
05:41:10,639 --> 05:41:14,319
where more than five minutes for like a community video would be.

3226
05:41:15,439 --> 05:41:26,630
Maybe in some cases, no music videos,

3227
05:41:26,630 --> 05:41:27,750
no full music videos.

3228
05:41:28,389 --> 05:41:31,830
Maybe to, this is so early, you have to remember.

3229
05:41:31,830 --> 05:41:34,630
Like this is the second one that I've done.

3230
05:41:34,630 --> 05:41:36,950
So I'm still trying to figure out exactly how these are gonna play out.

3231
05:41:36,950 --> 05:41:44,389
But like full songs, videos like over five minutes maybe,

3232
05:41:44,389 --> 05:41:45,669
I'm trying to think of what would work

3233
05:41:46,310 --> 05:41:56,180
because the bottles getting nuked on some of them.

3234
05:41:56,180 --> 05:42:01,729
Yeah, the music based ones are really good.

3235
05:42:01,729 --> 05:42:02,610
Yeah, that's right.

3236
05:42:02,610 --> 05:42:07,330
I mean, it's, I don't know, it's a learning process.

3237
05:42:08,049 --> 05:42:16,599
Just do an empty playlist.

3238
05:42:26,819 --> 05:42:29,540
Do all the music videos last so they get muted together.

3239
05:42:31,009 --> 05:42:32,130
That's a possibility too.

3240
05:42:32,770 --> 05:42:36,419
Are the ones being bypassed considered for next time?

3241
05:42:37,970 --> 05:42:39,169
For the most part, no.

3242
05:42:39,169 --> 05:42:41,569
But there are a few of them that I didn't show

3243
05:42:41,569 --> 05:42:43,169
that will probably just be on the next one.

3244
05:42:43,729 --> 05:42:45,330
I think door cubes yours in particular.

3245
05:42:46,439 --> 05:42:49,400
Because I'm still trying to figure out like length of videos.

3246
05:42:57,799 --> 05:43:01,080
And that was not on the rules at all over the last month or two.

3247
05:43:01,080 --> 05:43:08,659
So just write solid rules.

3248
05:43:08,659 --> 05:43:10,259
Well, there are rules there, but here's the thing.

3249
05:43:11,459 --> 05:43:12,900
No one will ever be happy.

3250
05:43:12,900 --> 05:43:13,700
That's just a fact.

3251
05:43:14,560 --> 05:43:16,400
Because if I make a rule that somebody doesn't like,

3252
05:43:16,400 --> 05:43:18,159
they'll be pissed off about it.

3253
05:43:18,799 --> 05:43:20,400
Don't have videos longer than five minutes.

3254
05:43:20,400 --> 05:43:22,130
Well, why not?

3255
05:43:22,130 --> 05:43:28,849
Don't have videos that are a majority of just clips from the stream

3256
05:43:28,849 --> 05:43:29,729
that we already have seen.

3257
05:43:31,220 --> 05:43:31,700
Why not?

3258
05:43:32,259 --> 05:43:39,540
Here come the protesters.

3259
05:43:42,229 --> 05:43:43,909
Ban Jojo videos.

3260
05:43:43,909 --> 05:43:45,270
Well, what if I didn't do that?

3261
05:43:45,270 --> 05:43:45,909
What if I do that?

3262
05:43:45,909 --> 05:43:46,709
What if I didn't do that?

3263
05:43:47,270 --> 05:43:53,279
Ban Jojo videos and dumb clips.

3264
05:43:54,340 --> 05:43:55,139
Do you see what I'm saying?

3265
05:43:55,139 --> 05:43:56,900
Somebody's already writing that.

3266
05:43:56,900 --> 05:43:58,419
Somebody is already writing that.

3267
05:44:15,279 --> 05:44:16,479
Ban my content.

3268
05:44:19,779 --> 05:44:21,540
What I'll end up doing is I'm going to go through

3269
05:44:21,540 --> 05:44:25,799
and put in some more like hard rules.

3270
05:44:25,799 --> 05:44:28,040
Because there are only a couple of real hard rules there right now.

3271
05:44:28,040 --> 05:44:29,560
Remember, this is the second time we've done this.

3272
05:44:30,279 --> 05:44:34,529
This is community content night two, not like 30.

3273
05:44:36,500 --> 05:44:39,139
Trying to figure it out as we go.

3274
05:44:39,860 --> 05:44:50,310
Flaccid rules.

3275
05:44:57,110 --> 05:44:59,029
If your submission got bypassed,

3276
05:44:59,669 --> 05:45:02,229
wait for the new rules to show up, which I will do them.

3277
05:45:02,229 --> 05:45:04,709
I'll do them later on tonight and probably tomorrow.

3278
05:45:05,750 --> 05:45:06,069
We'll see.

3279
05:45:06,069 --> 05:45:07,189
They'll be there in the next day or two.

3280
05:45:08,639 --> 05:45:10,880
Check through the solid hard rules that I'm going to write.

3281
05:45:12,080 --> 05:45:12,959
And then bingo.

3282
05:45:13,599 --> 05:45:16,950
Put it in.

3283
05:45:24,340 --> 05:45:25,540
Nice hard rules.

3284
05:45:31,720 --> 05:45:34,119
But to be fair though, there really were only, I think,

3285
05:45:34,759 --> 05:45:36,040
a handful of omissions.

3286
05:45:37,319 --> 05:45:38,840
Some of them may not have even been intentional.

3287
05:45:39,400 --> 05:45:45,270
You know, of the hundreds of submissions, almost all of them got in.

3288
05:45:45,270 --> 05:45:55,240
And unfortunately, when you're doing a new thing,

3289
05:45:55,240 --> 05:45:56,919
sometimes something falls through the cracks and

3290
05:45:57,560 --> 05:45:58,680
somebody's like, what the fuck happened?

3291
05:45:58,680 --> 05:45:59,799
And it's like, let's figure it out.

3292
05:46:00,599 --> 05:46:04,369
And that's what we're doing.

3293
05:46:05,009 --> 05:46:18,389
You need a German 985 quality assurance team.

3294
05:46:19,750 --> 05:46:23,540
Yeah, but then it's the mod's fault, right?

3295
05:46:24,790 --> 05:46:28,310
If I give a set of rules to the mods and then the mods go through

3296
05:46:28,310 --> 05:46:31,430
and they omit things that are not of the rules,

3297
05:46:32,310 --> 05:46:33,750
then everybody hates the mods.

3298
05:46:33,750 --> 05:46:36,069
And then it's just the cycle continues to repeat itself.

3299
05:46:51,430 --> 05:46:53,439
But to end this conversation,

3300
05:46:55,220 --> 05:46:58,580
if something you submitted was not shown,

3301
05:47:00,000 --> 05:47:05,360
check that Discord, the pinned message in the Discord channel.

3302
05:47:05,360 --> 05:47:09,200
I'm going to give like a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang rules.

3303
05:47:10,720 --> 05:47:12,560
Check your submission, do it again.

3304
05:47:12,560 --> 05:47:20,180
But also remember that omissions are probably still going to happen

3305
05:47:20,180 --> 05:47:25,060
just because of time and amount of submissions.

3306
05:47:25,060 --> 05:47:27,540
And it's not guaranteed.

3307
05:47:27,540 --> 05:47:30,259
Your video can't ever be guaranteed to be on stream

3308
05:47:30,900 --> 05:47:35,119
because what if it gets removed from YouTube?

3309
05:47:35,119 --> 05:47:35,919
That's not my fault.

3310
05:47:35,919 --> 05:47:38,799
I can't be like, it's guaranteed if you submit it with this.

3311
05:47:38,799 --> 05:47:40,799
It's going to be on the stream.

3312
05:47:41,439 --> 05:47:44,080
There are things out of my control that might happen

3313
05:47:45,540 --> 05:47:46,979
that I can't guarantee.

3314
05:47:47,700 --> 05:47:52,840
Like if your video gets like removed from YouTube or something,

3315
05:47:52,840 --> 05:47:54,680
or like your channel gets like striked,

3316
05:47:55,479 --> 05:47:57,080
I can't, there's nothing I can do about that.

3317
05:47:57,639 --> 05:48:12,549
Talk to YouTube and use some of your clout.

3318
05:48:13,569 --> 05:48:15,650
If you think under a hundred million years

3319
05:48:15,650 --> 05:48:18,529
that YouTube even has employees that work on a day-to-day basis

3320
05:48:18,529 --> 05:48:20,130
that listen to fucking content creators,

3321
05:48:20,849 --> 05:48:25,520
there are people with like 50 times more subscribers than I do

3322
05:48:25,520 --> 05:48:28,319
that get like the default support letter back.

3323
05:48:29,040 --> 05:48:31,619
That ain't going to happen.

3324
05:48:43,060 --> 05:48:49,090
But we got two, three more bits to do and we can go to bed

3325
05:48:49,090 --> 05:48:50,130
and I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3326
05:49:06,819 --> 05:49:07,220
Thank you.

3327
05:49:07,220 --> 05:49:08,580
Spooky Spitfire for the 250.

3328
05:49:08,580 --> 05:49:09,779
So Jerm, there are a couple things I have to say.

3329
05:49:09,779 --> 05:49:12,180
First, thanks for you for resisting the uh-oh vid.

3330
05:49:12,819 --> 05:49:15,299
Aside from meme value, it's the bottom of the barrel.

3331
05:49:16,180 --> 05:49:19,119
Second, I honestly haven't even touched Sekiro

3332
05:49:19,119 --> 05:49:20,560
since the last time I donated.

3333
05:49:21,360 --> 05:49:25,400
I don't know, something about Sekiro just turns me off.

3334
05:49:25,479 --> 05:49:28,200
Also, new ranting, new rating.

3335
05:49:29,000 --> 05:49:36,639
Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Dark Souls 2, SD2, Sekiro.

3336
05:49:37,540 --> 05:49:37,939
Really?

3337
05:49:42,529 --> 05:49:43,889
Dark Souls 2 over Sekiro?

3338
05:49:48,209 --> 05:49:49,729
They're both pretty polarizing, I can see that.

3339
05:50:01,169 --> 05:50:03,009
Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls 3.

3340
05:50:03,009 --> 05:50:04,290
I'm not sure, sir, I agree with that.

3341
05:50:08,529 --> 05:50:09,970
Third, what video is this?

3342
05:50:11,560 --> 05:50:14,419
It's an old video I did in like high school.

3343
05:50:14,419 --> 05:50:16,900
With friends of mine, we've gone over it before.

3344
05:50:20,020 --> 05:50:23,220
We have touched on this video like three or four times now.

3345
05:50:23,860 --> 05:50:25,220
Over the course of the last year or two.

3346
05:50:25,939 --> 05:50:28,849
Pretty weird video, yes.

3347
05:50:29,490 --> 05:50:44,040
Basically, there's new terms of service they can make a terminated channel

3348
05:50:44,040 --> 05:50:45,400
that isn't providing them income.

3349
05:50:45,959 --> 05:50:48,840
Their wording is vague enough that it can be interpreted as against

3350
05:50:48,840 --> 05:50:51,240
actually shitty videos or small creators.

3351
05:50:51,240 --> 05:50:51,799
Wait, what?

3352
05:50:52,680 --> 05:50:53,400
Is that for real?

3353
05:50:53,959 --> 05:50:58,680
What the hell is going on over there?

3354
05:51:08,369 --> 05:51:10,610
Jerma Ass Stinky Feet.

3355
05:51:10,610 --> 05:51:11,810
You changed your name, thanks.

3356
05:51:12,610 --> 05:51:15,540
You changed it to instead of has, okay.

3357
05:51:16,419 --> 05:51:17,860
Thanks for the 250.

3358
05:51:17,860 --> 05:51:22,119
Hey, Jerma, a while ago you said if I didn't donate 46% of my net income to you,

3359
05:51:22,119 --> 05:51:23,799
you wouldn't be able to afford dog food.

3360
05:51:27,810 --> 05:51:29,090
Is this the same person?

3361
05:51:29,090 --> 05:51:30,529
I feel like these are the same people.

3362
05:51:31,490 --> 05:51:33,409
With two or three different Grillmaster accounts.

3363
05:51:33,409 --> 05:51:34,290
Is that what's going on?

3364
05:51:35,009 --> 05:51:42,549
What's with this 46.3% income thing?

3365
05:51:56,740 --> 05:51:58,020
You are a hive mind, that's right.

3366
05:51:58,819 --> 05:52:01,060
Chunky Baloney, thanks for the $5.75.

3367
05:52:02,020 --> 05:52:04,659
I know you love this monkey, stinky monkey thing,

3368
05:52:04,659 --> 05:52:06,020
but please stop talking about it.

3369
05:52:06,020 --> 05:52:07,540
The Jerma brand is better than this.

3370
05:52:09,270 --> 05:52:09,990
God damn it.

3371
05:52:10,950 --> 05:52:14,099
Thank you, Jay Bong for the 250.

3372
05:52:14,099 --> 05:52:15,380
Yeah, for the next green screen night,

3373
05:52:15,380 --> 05:52:17,779
please get some better lighting and camera quality.

3374
05:52:18,500 --> 05:52:20,580
Well, the lights are just the studio lights.

3375
05:52:20,580 --> 05:52:21,700
I can't really move those,

3376
05:52:22,979 --> 05:52:25,700
but the camera will be better this time.

3377
05:52:34,279 --> 05:52:34,919
That's for sure.

3378
05:52:43,669 --> 05:52:45,509
And then DoorCube, thanks for the 250.

3379
05:52:46,229 --> 05:52:48,400
This is touching upon the rules again.

3380
05:52:48,400 --> 05:52:50,159
I will make the rules very, very clear.

3381
05:52:51,729 --> 05:52:55,169
I have in my mind what I want them to be.

3382
05:52:55,889 --> 05:52:58,610
It might take me a day or two to get them up there in the pin message.

3383
05:52:59,330 --> 05:53:00,689
But just check it out again.

3384
05:53:02,849 --> 05:53:04,610
Your video was the carnival thing, right?

3385
05:53:04,610 --> 05:53:09,080
Carnival and like italics, like talking about me and stuff, right?

3386
05:53:09,080 --> 05:53:10,279
I'm remembering this correctly, right?

3387
05:53:16,529 --> 05:53:17,250
Yeah, yeah, okay.

3388
05:53:21,700 --> 05:53:24,419
Yeah, that one probably should have been shown.

3389
05:53:24,419 --> 05:53:25,860
I must have omitted it.

3390
05:53:25,860 --> 05:53:26,740
I think it was the length,

3391
05:53:26,740 --> 05:53:28,580
but then it was like a 10 minutes was the length and

3392
05:53:29,860 --> 05:53:31,139
that'll be shown next time.

3393
05:53:31,139 --> 05:53:33,139
I actually remember that one specifically

3394
05:53:33,700 --> 05:53:35,860
and like clicking it and having it on a tab.

3395
05:53:39,459 --> 05:53:40,580
So it's my bad.

3396
05:53:49,029 --> 05:53:49,909
Shave my eyebrows.

3397
05:53:49,909 --> 05:53:51,189
Why would I shave my eyebrows?

3398
05:54:01,240 --> 05:54:02,919
No, no, the rules need to be hard.

3399
05:54:02,919 --> 05:54:03,400
They do.

3400
05:54:03,400 --> 05:54:06,840
I just like I, like I said, I had this thing in my brain where it's like

3401
05:54:06,840 --> 05:54:14,439
if you give hard rules for stuff about like what is like art and content,

3402
05:54:14,439 --> 05:54:17,650
it's like you start to run that line of

3403
05:54:18,369 --> 05:54:23,110
how can you even determine what's like should be allowed and what shouldn't be

3404
05:54:23,110 --> 05:54:25,029
when it's just like community meme nights.

3405
05:54:26,599 --> 05:54:27,639
It's a hard thing to do.

3406
05:54:30,020 --> 05:54:32,180
Like know this, know that, know this, do this.

3407
05:54:32,180 --> 05:54:32,900
Keep it under here.

3408
05:54:32,900 --> 05:54:33,459
Keep it over here.

3409
05:54:33,459 --> 05:54:52,529
It's hard to juggle it, but I'm going to put some legit rules again.

3410
05:54:53,330 --> 05:54:54,130
Third time's a charm.

3411
05:54:54,130 --> 05:54:55,970
We'll see if we get it right by number three.

3412
05:54:55,970 --> 05:54:57,250
And that's not to say anything was wrong.

3413
05:54:58,130 --> 05:54:59,569
This is fantastic.

3414
05:55:00,689 --> 05:55:02,770
These streams, the last two of these have been fucking amazing,

3415
05:55:04,500 --> 05:55:06,819
but including the people that should be included

3416
05:55:07,720 --> 05:55:09,560
is obviously a big part of it too.

3417
05:55:09,560 --> 05:55:12,119
So I'll get it right.

3418
05:55:13,080 --> 05:55:13,720
I'll get it right.

3419
05:55:20,580 --> 05:55:23,330
Anyways, we are at almost the end.

3420
05:55:25,700 --> 05:55:26,419
Lazy Luke.

3421
05:55:26,979 --> 05:55:28,020
Thanks for the 250.

3422
05:55:28,020 --> 05:55:29,619
Jerma, I made you this Jupiter page.

3423
05:55:29,619 --> 05:55:32,819
If someone does a jupin chat, you can click it to save the earth.

3424
05:55:33,380 --> 05:55:34,020
Wait, what?

3425
05:55:34,979 --> 05:55:38,770
You can click it to save the earth.

3426
05:55:51,360 --> 05:55:52,159
No one's done one.

3427
05:55:52,880 --> 05:55:54,959
Click on Jupiter to save earth.

3428
05:55:55,599 --> 05:55:58,450
Oh, I want to get this on stream.

3429
05:55:58,450 --> 05:55:59,169
This is really cool.

3430
05:56:04,740 --> 05:56:05,779
This is cool.

3431
05:56:06,419 --> 05:56:16,529
Is this going to work?

3432
05:56:21,270 --> 05:56:21,990
I think so.

3433
05:56:23,509 --> 05:56:28,180
Take a look at this.

3434
05:56:28,900 --> 05:56:30,709
There's some Jupiters.

3435
05:56:30,709 --> 05:56:31,189
Let's see them.

3436
05:56:36,159 --> 05:56:37,200
It actually works.

3437
05:56:41,090 --> 05:56:42,290
Can I click the mes?

3438
05:56:51,330 --> 05:56:52,369
Come on, flood it.

3439
05:56:52,369 --> 05:56:53,090
Let's see it.

3440
05:56:53,090 --> 05:57:04,040
I want to see more, more, more, more, more, more, more.

3441
05:57:04,040 --> 05:57:04,759
Only two?

3442
05:57:04,759 --> 05:57:05,639
Only four?

3443
05:57:05,639 --> 05:57:06,840
You can do better than this.

3444
05:57:06,840 --> 05:57:15,540
All right, I'm going to let them come up for a little bit.

3445
05:57:15,540 --> 05:57:16,020
Oh, shit.

3446
05:57:16,020 --> 05:57:16,979
Here we go.

3447
05:57:16,979 --> 05:57:20,479
That's because of slow mode.

3448
05:57:20,479 --> 05:57:29,909
Go for it.

3449
05:57:34,979 --> 05:57:35,939
There we go.

3450
05:57:35,939 --> 05:57:36,659
Here they come.

3451
05:57:40,400 --> 05:57:41,439
Save earth quick.

3452
05:57:42,000 --> 05:57:49,810
This is so stupid.

3453
05:57:49,810 --> 05:57:50,290
I love it.

3454
05:57:51,090 --> 05:57:52,049
Oh, shit.

3455
05:57:52,049 --> 05:57:54,130
You guys are kind of hammering down right now.

3456
05:57:56,200 --> 05:57:57,560
Nothing's touched earth though.

3457
05:57:57,560 --> 05:57:59,479
I protected earth flawlessly.

3458
05:58:06,770 --> 05:58:07,250
All right.

3459
05:58:07,250 --> 05:58:07,810
All right.

3460
05:58:07,810 --> 05:58:08,529
Let's kill this.

3461
05:58:13,220 --> 05:58:14,900
That's really, really cool though, Lazy Luke.

3462
05:58:15,540 --> 05:58:18,180
Another addition to the JermaBorg website.

3463
05:58:19,139 --> 05:58:19,860
That's good stuff.

3464
05:58:20,580 --> 05:58:23,840
That's really neat.

3465
05:58:23,840 --> 05:58:24,080
All right.

3466
05:58:24,080 --> 05:58:28,240
I got to put slow mode back to, I don't know, 10 seconds?

3467
05:58:28,240 --> 05:58:28,799
What was it?

3468
05:58:28,799 --> 05:58:29,360
What was it at?

3469
05:58:29,360 --> 05:58:29,919
Five seconds?

3470
05:58:30,560 --> 05:58:31,569
I have no idea.

3471
05:58:36,580 --> 05:58:40,520
But thank you to Cold Warhol.

3472
05:58:40,520 --> 05:58:41,400
Thanks for the thousand bits.

3473
05:58:41,400 --> 05:58:42,840
They say thank you so much for showing my art.

3474
05:58:42,840 --> 05:58:43,720
I'm glad you liked it.

3475
05:58:44,439 --> 05:58:46,840
Here's 10 bucks for not playing the stinky video.

3476
05:58:47,479 --> 05:58:50,259
I'll take it.

3477
05:58:50,259 --> 05:58:50,819
Thank you.

3478
05:58:50,819 --> 05:58:55,409
And yes, by all means, all the artwork was fucking awesome.

3479
05:58:56,130 --> 05:59:09,009
Grill Master is now hosting you.

3480
05:59:09,889 --> 05:59:11,759
Well, that's not even the right name.

3481
05:59:11,759 --> 05:59:13,750
So nice try though.

3482
05:59:14,389 --> 05:59:16,880
It's Grill Meister.

3483
05:59:17,599 --> 05:59:24,520
Frodiun Weapon, thanks for the thousand bits, Frodiun.

3484
05:59:26,069 --> 05:59:27,750
Love and appreciate the streams as always, man.

3485
05:59:27,750 --> 05:59:28,869
It was pretty low energy this month,

3486
05:59:28,869 --> 05:59:31,509
so I missed out on this month's community content night.

3487
05:59:31,509 --> 05:59:34,229
But I will try my best to submit some art for next time.

3488
05:59:34,709 --> 05:59:36,869
Can't compare to some of this amazing talent on here though,

3489
05:59:36,869 --> 05:59:38,310
but I won't let it deter me.

3490
05:59:39,270 --> 05:59:39,990
Don't be deterred.

3491
05:59:47,680 --> 05:59:51,279
Everything that was shown today had its own value.

3492
05:59:51,279 --> 05:59:54,000
That goes for videos and for art.

3493
05:59:54,720 --> 05:59:59,540
I just gotta work out the kinks and the rules.

3494
06:00:00,180 --> 06:00:03,349
But thank you.

3495
06:00:03,909 --> 06:00:07,090
Hope to see a submission from you soon.

3496
06:00:07,729 --> 06:00:14,900
Hey, Jerma has stinky feet, thanks for the 250.

3497
06:00:15,540 --> 06:00:18,240
I already got this one.

3498
06:00:18,240 --> 06:00:20,560
I don't know, because it's the 46% thing again, right?

3499
06:00:27,650 --> 06:00:29,490
Large, thanks for the 500 bits, large.

3500
06:00:30,290 --> 06:00:31,090
They say do it.

3501
06:00:31,650 --> 06:00:32,529
Scream, do it.

3502
06:00:32,529 --> 06:00:33,009
Why would I?

3503
06:00:33,009 --> 06:00:33,889
I'm not gonna scream.

3504
06:00:36,000 --> 06:00:36,639
Scream.

3505
06:00:43,990 --> 06:00:45,750
Verdebril Giant, thanks for the 250.

3506
06:00:45,750 --> 06:00:47,349
Just wanna show you Lazy Luke's game.

3507
06:00:47,349 --> 06:00:48,709
Thanks for the gut-busting stream.

3508
06:00:49,750 --> 06:00:50,470
It was a lot of fun.

3509
06:00:51,560 --> 06:00:53,560
I love this shit more than anything, so.

3510
06:00:54,439 --> 06:00:59,840
Getting to sit back and just watch the crazy shit that you guys do.

3511
06:01:09,590 --> 06:01:10,869
Get lurked on, what?

3512
06:01:11,509 --> 06:01:14,419
Well, I'm clicking the link.

3513
06:01:20,790 --> 06:01:22,229
I did actually see this already,

3514
06:01:22,229 --> 06:01:23,509
because this was submitted today.

3515
06:01:26,080 --> 06:01:27,599
I gotta put that in the rules, too.

3516
06:01:27,599 --> 06:01:28,959
Gotta put that in the rules, too.

3517
06:01:34,740 --> 06:01:38,419
The day before the stream, I got all the rules already upstairs.

3518
06:01:39,439 --> 06:01:42,500
In my mind.

3519
06:01:42,500 --> 06:01:44,979
I did say this is fucking awesome, and it's hilarious.

3520
06:01:47,779 --> 06:01:51,619
But I have to add to the rules that any submission that happens

3521
06:01:51,619 --> 06:01:55,540
at like 12 a.m., the day of that stream,

3522
06:01:56,419 --> 06:01:58,500
it's gonna be the next time.

3523
06:02:04,040 --> 06:02:07,830
But, I mean, you're a goddamn founder, so.

3524
06:02:09,119 --> 06:02:10,319
There's only fucking 20 of you.

3525
06:02:21,889 --> 06:02:23,009
Wait, did that work?

3526
06:02:25,090 --> 06:02:26,049
It did not work.

3527
06:02:26,049 --> 06:02:26,549
Why?

3528
06:02:27,090 --> 06:02:29,459
Oh, yes, it did.

3529
06:02:34,200 --> 06:02:35,959
I mean, you're a damn founder, so.

3530
06:02:42,229 --> 06:02:44,400
Do I have a big forehead?

3531
06:02:50,099 --> 06:02:50,599
Oops.

3532
06:02:51,139 --> 06:02:51,779
Wait, go back.

3533
06:02:51,779 --> 06:02:52,340
Go back there.

3534
06:02:52,340 --> 06:02:53,139
Go back, go back, go back.

3535
06:02:53,139 --> 06:02:53,700
Back, back, back.

3536
06:02:53,700 --> 06:02:54,740
Sorry for bumping you twice.

3537
06:02:57,090 --> 06:02:58,369
I do have a big forehead?

3538
06:02:58,369 --> 06:02:59,810
It's glue, man.

3539
06:02:59,810 --> 06:03:01,970
No, I guess I do have kind of a bumpy head.

3540
06:03:05,990 --> 06:03:06,790
It's awesome, though.

3541
06:03:07,590 --> 06:03:08,950
And we're gonna show it again next time.

3542
06:03:11,060 --> 06:03:11,560
Thank you.

3543
06:03:12,180 --> 06:03:14,900
And I'll see you guys tomorrow for, I don't know, Dead Rising.

3544
06:03:14,900 --> 06:03:16,900
I don't know, maybe Outer Worlds.

3545
06:03:16,900 --> 06:03:18,340
I don't know, maybe Katamari.

3546
06:03:18,340 --> 06:03:19,779
I don't know, maybe a PlayStation game.

3547
06:03:19,779 --> 06:03:21,139
I who fucking has any idea?

3548
06:03:22,020 --> 06:03:35,159
Could be anything.

3549
06:03:35,159 --> 06:03:36,680
Bath Bomb Boy, thanks for the 250.

3550
06:03:36,680 --> 06:03:38,599
You gotta make some of this art and merch.

3551
06:03:38,599 --> 06:03:39,799
They're such good designs.

3552
06:03:39,799 --> 06:03:40,299
They are.

3553
06:03:41,720 --> 06:03:43,319
But that's another thing that I want to get right.

3554
06:03:44,709 --> 06:03:45,830
It's really easy just to be like,

3555
06:03:45,830 --> 06:03:48,869
yeah, we'll do art on some of those.

3556
06:03:48,869 --> 06:03:49,830
And I'm gonna sell them.

3557
06:03:50,709 --> 06:03:53,060
But once money becomes involved,

3558
06:03:54,319 --> 06:03:56,000
it's, you gotta do that shit right.

3559
06:03:56,720 --> 06:04:01,889
You don't want anyone to be unhappy

3560
06:04:01,889 --> 06:04:04,049
or get taken advantage of,

3561
06:04:04,049 --> 06:04:06,529
or it's gotta be done correct.

3562
06:04:07,490 --> 06:04:16,000
Double music.

3563
06:04:16,560 --> 06:04:18,610
Zipper rule.

3564
06:04:18,610 --> 06:04:19,330
Oh, right, right.

3565
06:04:19,330 --> 06:04:20,209
Yeah, sorry about that.

3566
06:04:23,119 --> 06:04:24,479
And again, I do want to say,

3567
06:04:24,479 --> 06:04:26,639
if your submission didn't get through, I'm sorry.

3568
06:04:27,520 --> 06:04:31,759
It's hard for me to guarantee submissions.

3569
06:04:33,110 --> 06:04:34,549
But with solid rules,

3570
06:04:34,549 --> 06:04:36,790
I think that that won't have to be up to, like,

3571
06:04:36,790 --> 06:04:40,549
my discretion for the moment that I happen to look at it

3572
06:04:40,549 --> 06:04:41,110
and see what it is.

3573
06:04:45,810 --> 06:04:48,560
So hold me to that.

3574
06:04:48,560 --> 06:04:50,479
In a couple of days, look at that pin channel.

3575
06:04:50,479 --> 06:04:54,720
There'll be actual real, like, one through eight set of rules.

3576
06:05:04,000 --> 06:05:04,479
Sound good?

3577
06:05:05,720 --> 06:05:06,200
Sound good.

3578
06:05:07,000 --> 06:05:08,880
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3579
06:05:14,520 --> 06:05:16,200
Hold on, but to be fair,

3580
06:05:17,000 --> 06:05:19,560
to be fair, for the most part,

3581
06:05:19,560 --> 06:05:23,639
I was referring to the uh-oh stinky monkey

3582
06:05:24,740 --> 06:05:27,459
being, like, not eligible for a submission.

3583
06:05:30,470 --> 06:05:32,790
That was where that conversation started.

3584
06:05:37,830 --> 06:05:39,459
All right.

3585
06:05:39,459 --> 06:05:40,180
Good night.

3586
06:05:40,180 --> 06:05:41,220
I'll see you tomorrow.

3587
06:05:45,119 --> 06:05:45,680
Take care, guys.

3588
06:05:48,439 --> 06:05:49,880
Wet Warrior, thanks for the 300 bits.

3589
06:05:49,880 --> 06:05:51,240
They say do me a favor to have a good one.

3590
06:05:51,240 --> 06:05:51,639
You too.

3591
06:05:52,360 --> 06:05:53,319
Right at the end.

3592
06:05:53,319 --> 06:06:24,479
See you soon.
