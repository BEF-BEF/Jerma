1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,619
Oh, everybody's expecting her was expecting me to do a big VR rant.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,820
Yeah, like I do every time. Everyone's expecting it. You're like, oh, wait, wait,

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,219
here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, here it is. Yeah, here it is. Here it comes.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,730
I'm not gonna give it to you today. I was gonna go. Let me tell you though. Fuck.

5
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:31,800
Nevermind. I was gonna say fuck VR. Yesterday. All right. Everybody relax.

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:39,600
Yesterday. I set everything up. Everything was ready to go. And this, why does this

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
continue to happen? I don't know. I set everything up. Everything's ready to go.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,759
It's a beautiful VR space with all this cool stuff. Right. I get up this morning.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,840
And I couldn't, you couldn't download Hitman 3 on Steam. They waited till the

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,239
last second to even put a Steam store page up. So like, I don't don't get mad.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,599
So I literally like three hours ago, you could finally go to the Steam page for

12
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:18,540
this game. And I got it. And I got it ready. And I open up the VR segment. And

13
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,659
the shit is just mirrored, just flipped. Everything is just mirrored. I was

14
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,310
reading everything backwards. Everything works fine. Is the only program I was

15
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,269
using that was flipped horizontally. Steam VR was fine. My other games were

16
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:41,579
fine. My headsets fine. Why was the game flipped horizontally? Dude, I restarted

17
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,810
the game like 15 to 20 times. And it's not flipped anymore. I, I don't what

18
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,549
happened? What the fuck happened? All right. I'm not gonna go any further. I'm

19
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,269
just gonna tell you that Hitman VR is not good. I haven't even played it yet.

20
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:02,269
Everyone just relax for a minute. I need to sleep. Let me just let me just chill.

21
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,770
Let me chill. He's gonna cry on stream. What's wrong with your voice? I'm like

22
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,849
talking in a weird place. I'm talking I have I'm using the VR headset mic like

23
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,520
it did last time. So I'm talking in a weird place. I don't know. Maybe I sound

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,879
weird. I don't know. Seething. No, I have that like seething voice. Do you guys

25
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,520
know exactly what I'm talking about? I like you can tell by the sound of my

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,439
voice. I'm like seething by the words trail off like it's a little more airy.

27
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,879
You know what I mean? Like that's exactly what it is. I've been sitting for three

28
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,099
hours every and this happens every time. VR is a $1,000 paperweight. I take that

29
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,259
back. I don't mean that. I do. Anyways, I don't mean that. It's actually really

30
00:02:53,259 --> 00:03:04,169
fun. I'm so fucking mad. I'm going back and forth with VR Josh like, dude, what's

31
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,770
going on? Why is my game flipped? He's like, really trying to help me and stuff.

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:15,169
But actually, he had some good tips. So okay. VR is a piece of crap. I hate it. I

33
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:21,259
can't wait to play Hitman VR. Are you guys excited? Don't turn off. Please don't

34
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,460
turn off. I don't know. It took me so long to get to this stage. Don't do the beat.

35
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,590
Do not turn the fuck off. It took me forever. I downloaded three different

36
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,800
programs to get the chat window to show up. Because Hitman VR, don't say it. I'm

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,680
just drinking coffee. Just chilling out. We're just gonna chill out and drink

38
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:53,349
some coffee. Okay. We're gonna hang out. We're gonna chill. We're gonna drink

39
00:03:53,349 --> 00:04:01,500
some coffee. We're gonna hang out. Hi, everybody. The Hitman VR flipped. It's

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:26,980
not. For an illusion again. The room's not big. It's a full room. All right. Are

41
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,079
you guys ready? Coffee's not good for you. Actually, there was a study that was

42
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:42,709
done. Medicine magazine. Coffee is actually good for your brain. It's

43
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:46,430
actually good for your liver. And then I don't don't drink don't drink like the

44
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,870
fucking extra cream extra sugar bullshit. This is what I'm talking about. Don't

45
00:04:50,870 --> 00:05:10,560
dump it. It's a black coffee. Just black. That cup is huge. Pretty normal to me. I

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,180
didn't get my I got my ring light setup. Even more footage at the boomer brace on

47
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,339
I'm ready to go for like two to three hours. What brand coffee is that? Of

48
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:41,360
course. Turbo 985. Brinks Illy coffee. I'm gonna get in. I believe the audio is

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
on. I don't know. All right. What mission should I do? Because I have access to

50
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:57,100
everything. What do you guys think? Make sure I get in this thing. Well, I see

51

53
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,699
make sure that he's not gonna hurt your guys ears? Would you guys allow me to do

54
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:29,420
that? Press A to play. All right, dude. Press A to play. What's going on here?

55
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:37,540
Can I do a few scream tests? All right. What's going on? Don't even fucking tell

56
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:53,740

57
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,180

58
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,199
VR. There's one. This is a little loud. I will say. At least for me. Not for you. I'll

59
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,579
make sure to turn you guys up but I'm gonna turn me down. Welcome to hell.

60
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:17,189
Welcome to streaming VR where four people need to be in the room for it to

61
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:24,470
work out the way that you want it to. I'm going on another rant. Is that loud? How

62
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:38,579
loud is that? Is it bad? What just happened? Your camera's tilted. Uh, I don't

63
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,819
think it is. I think it's an optical illusion, dude. Because that's...

64
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:53,420
No, my camera's not tilted. It's an optical illusion. Is it loud? All right. I

65
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,139
gotta get in this. I gotta get into this fucking game right now before I have a

66
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:10,220
meltdown. I gotta turn the audio down for me. Better? All right. Here we go.

67
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:27,120
You guys ready? Here we go. Here we go. How's it look? Let's go. Let's go. All

68
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:39,169

69
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,580
where am I going? What destination? What do you think? We can go to Miami? That's

70
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Hitman 2, right? I'm not doing the concrete level first. You're out of your

71
00:08:50,580 --> 00:09:00,740
mind. That is not happening. Concrete. Concrete. Concrete. Dude, Dubai. All right.

72
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,299
You know what? Let's just do Miami because this is like one of the first

73
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,179
levels of the second game. I'm very curious how this is gonna be. How

74
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:15,470
is there hair in my nose? I just blew up to get the nose out of, like,

75
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,549
the hair out of my nose and I just fogged up the glasses. I don't want to

76
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:24,820
scream because I think it's loud. Okay. Spoiler alert. Doesn't matter. They're

77
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:34,259
all fogged up now. Oh, fuck you, VR. Are you kidding me? I put, like, that fucking

78
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:41,360
gas up there. All right. I don't even care. Yeah. I feel like, I feel like in

79
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,100
VR, it's like that I'm, like, getting fitted for a wedding dress. That's how

80
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,399
many people need to be in this room to help me. Like, I'm going like this. There's

81
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
a person with, like, a thing going around my neck and around my, like, my waistline

82
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,490
Does this look good? I need five people in here. Help me. All right.

83
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,720
Difficulty. Not casual, right? Or should I do? I mean, it's VR. Isn't this gonna be,

84
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,990
like, impossible? Let's find out. All right. Here we go. Do I need to play

85
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:27,259
anything? I don't think so. Let's go. Please, God, do casual. Well, it's a little too

86
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:47,509
late now. My shit's all fogged up. All right. Make sure this is tight. We already

87
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:55,179
know this shit. Nice t-shirt. Hey, thanks. We already know this. There's a

88
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:01,450
driver. There's, all right. Okay. Okay. The finish lines. This is actually, okay,

89
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:13,539
this is cool. Can I have a sip? Can I have a sip of that? I feel like, I feel like I'm playing,

90
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,059
remember when the Sims did their first-person update? I feel like that's

91
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:26,889
what I'm doing. What's wrong with my body? Am I gonna get in trouble? Why is there a

92
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:36,350
UFO? I didn't even punch him. I just, like, cocked my arm back. What? Listen to me.

93
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,779
Okay. This is too real in VR. It's too real. I don't, I can't play it, like, it's

94
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:50,149
too real. What's wrong with my hands? Why am I phasing out? How come nobody cares?

95
00:11:50,149 --> 00:12:05,330
Can I get in the picture? Where'd he go? I missed. I'm just a psycho. I'm sorry. No, I don't mean,

96
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,049
I don't, all right. You can arrest me. I don't know. I, this is weird. Everybody

97
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:17,350
looking at me. Stop, don't look at me. Stop looking at me. Stop looking at me. I

98
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:39,480
gotta get out of here! What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? What happened? I punched a guy. I punched a guy. It was me. I punched a guy. This is fucking chaos.

99
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:47,649
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. What are you

100
00:12:47,690 --> 00:13:03,679
doing? Okay, that was too much. That was way too much. Wait, what? Replay. Restart. All right, restart.

101
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:12,190
This is too much. We can't hear anything. Huh? I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up. I got it. I got it. I got it.

102
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:28,340
Where's the audio? There it is. How's that? All right, we're back. That better? Good. Now it's too

103
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:46,159
loud. Your mic is peaking. I know, man. How bad is the mic peaking? Let me fix it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Check this out. Oh shit. Let me test.

104
00:13:46,159 --> 00:14:05,659
Oh, that's better. Okay. Are we in? We're in, right? Yep. Okay. That was too much. That was like a little too much for me. All right, let's get in there.

105
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:30,600
How is anybody reliably supposed to do this? Okay, don't be an idiot. Just be a tourist. That sounds easy. How do I take a picture? How do you take a picture? Just on drugs.

106
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:42,470
Hey, man. Do you know how to work this thing, man? I don't know. Do you know how to work it? There's no batteries in that thing. Oh, man. Sorry.

107
00:14:42,470 --> 00:15:30,299
All right. So what do I got to do? Targets up there. Eliminate Sir Knox. Eliminate Robert Knox. All right. I know he's up there. And you're over there. All right. Why do my arms keep doing this? Hello, I'll take that. What is that? View Intel? How do I? What was it? How do I view Intel? Can I have one of those? Oh, wait, I can hold on. Hold up on the left touchpad. Oh, shit. Okay. I was gonna say, where's the map?

108
00:15:31,299 --> 00:16:10,120
Intel. All right. Globally Innovation. I can't speak. All right. Well, let's go. Am I gonna get in trouble if I go through here? Yes, sir. I don't think I have a weapon. Do I have a weapon? Thank you. Okay. Let's go, sir. All right. You're welcome. There's so many people to load. Kill that guy.

109
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:58,750
All right. Where are you guys? Oh, there you are. Let me go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Okay, let's go. Don't hurt anybody. What? Free photo shoot. Oh, soda. Why does your aluminum cans explode? You don't think that's a little dangerous? Why would an aluminum can explode? That's weird, right? All of us can agree that that's really fucking weird. Like, honestly.

110
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:35,200
I guess nobody else thinks that that's odd. Oh, you Intel. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Move out of the way. It was the Intel. I feel like I'm just I don't I when you have the other view, you can see what you're doing. I'm just lost at a convention. I hate this. I hate being like get away from me.

111
00:17:35,200 --> 00:18:28,829
Hold down the left pad. What are you saying? Go to the viewing area and pretend to be one. This is making me sick. I mean, it is VR. I'll try to reduce my movements. All right. What can I what can I just go down here? Oh, food. All right. Can I get fries? Hey, damn me. You damn me to do it. It's a catcher. Everyone's looking at me like I'm a boy. I'm a boy. I'm a boy. I'm a boy. I'm a boy. I'm a boy.

112
00:18:28,829 --> 00:19:09,309
Weirdo. I don't like being this close. Oh, parking garage is down here. The only thing we're calling is a bartender. Okay. Doesn't the guy come down here? Somebody comes down here. All right. Saving. POV. You're bald. Do the tutorial. I mean, I know I know how it works. This camera up there. Watch out. Okay, I got to dress as this guy. Jesus.

113
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:59,759
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding with you. No, you. You didn't see anything. What? Oh, shit. What the fuck?

114
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:11,230
That's like a monster. Security. No, come here. You need to deal with this guy right away.

115
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm trying to strangle him. This is a restraint. What? Nobody dicks with me. Give me the gun. What happened to the antelope? Whatever he was. How do I reload a gun? Yep. Okay.

116
00:20:35,230 --> 00:21:30,619
Okay. Oh, what? Where did the mascot go? Where's the mascot? I strangled him. What? Hold on. Oh, this is so I don't like this. This is scary. Oh, my God. This is so fucked up. I don't.

117
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:49,440
I could use some assistance. Oh, my God. What happened? What happened? How do I reload this? How do I reload this gun? All right, please. Nobody come in here.

118
00:21:49,440 --> 00:22:16,500
How do I stand up? Does anybody know how to? B, A? No, that's camera. How do I get up? How do I get up? C, right stick. Okay. All right. All right. Where is he?

119
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:27,240
The thing is, I don't even know. There's no mini map. So I don't know where the hell anybody's coming over here. This is hard mode. All right. I got to stuff him in here.

120
00:22:28,240 --> 00:23:00,420
Do you know what I mean? I can't. There's no mini map. Sorry, man. Okay. All right. We're good. I just got to get the hell out of here. I don't want any weapons or anything on me though, right? No weapons. Don't take any weapons.

121
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:25,140
Okay. Now that I'm disguised, that's okay. Just leave it open. Who cares? What about all the bodies? I don't know, man. Like, I'm going to have to leave them. What keeps happening to my arms? What's wrong with my body?

122
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:54,970
Oh, it's because I'm moving away from myself. Oh, this is weird. Why am I doing this? Okay. So now let's look at the Intel. Oh, okay. So I'm on this one right now. Key Intel was lost. Oh, nevermind.

123
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:21,150
How about a perfect machine? That sounds good. So where is that Intel? They're up there. All right. I'm going to go back up. I think I can actually go back up the whole way, right? Re-center your position with left stick. Oh, shit. Okay, nice.

124
00:24:21,150 --> 00:25:01,559
All right. So now I'm the mascot. So now I can walk around freely. I don't even care if I could see. All right. We're going to go this way. What's this? Oh, this is cool. Okay. Oh, I made it just in time for it to end. Oh, come on.

Hey, don't worry. It's all right. It's attached. It's cemented. It's screwed in. I'm just the weird guy that everybody looks at. Every time I try to do a little routine here. Hey, hey, knock on wood, right? That they're not going to kill us all.

130
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:22,099
I understood from the briefing earlier that we're just supposed to grab him if something happens to it. No poking around the engine. What? I can push people? This is the art. This particular car is the first production. What the fuck? Stop.

131
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:51,119

00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:16,119
Imagine a guy dressed like this running up and doing like a power move, right? Like an inch away from your face. How am I still allowed in here? I'm clearly on like fucking crack. I'm afraid not. We've had a few incidents with people getting a little

133
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:47,180
two hands. All right. Where's my restrict access to the car? Did I lose the Intel? Yes, of course. What was it? Okay. Oh, Robert Knox has a prototype of his RK mark three racing car on display in the Cronstadt Bayside Center. He's so concerned about it that he has ordered the engineers in the Expo building to get him immediately. Should anything happen to the car, it's likely he will come rushing down to fix it himself. Okay, we're gonna fuck up. We're gonna fuck up the car. You got it. Get out of the way. I didn't want to.

134
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:47,380
Talk to you. Okay, so I got to miss the car. Our engineers are working. Do not enter. What am I getting in trouble with this? Save it. He's gone. Hi. Hi, I'm back. Okay. What the fuck? What? What? What's wrong? No, I'm not. I mean, I'm just trying to get an Instagram video. I'm just trying to get an Instagram video for like my followers. I thought I could get a picture in there.

375
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:02,170
i think some of the teams are using it to increase car speed

376
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,369
heard a few cron step mechanics talking about it the other day

377
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:08,969
something about nox not wanting to use it because she wants to win on her own

378
01:08:08,969 --> 01:08:12,170
imagine that okay is it that illegal i don't know

379
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,449
nox ordered them to put it here so they asked me to put it here

380
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:23,399

01:56:37,029 --> 01:56:42,710
poor dr sorenson first he almost loses a patient to a seemingly harmless case of

698
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:45,989
dehydration now he has to deal with this guy

699
01:56:45,989 --> 01:56:50,949

701
01:56:55,670 --> 01:57:00,069

702
01:57:00,069 --> 01:57:02,869
days well at least i know who's buying his

703
01:57:02,869 --> 01:57:07,350
beer tonight follow the story mission so it seems cierra nox has jumped on the

704
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:11,029
revitalization bandwagon and is scheduled for an injection of

705
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:14,789
sure the doctor who is supposed to help her with the procedure

706
01:57:14,789 --> 01:57:17,989

what happened okay i actually the game actually crashed all right hold on let

733
02:00:22,579 --> 02:00:35,060
me fix this give me one sec uh it's running

734
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:40,520
i'm not joking what is it i'm not joking there's a wasp in here

735
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:47,430
it's not a wasp in here so here's the real problem

736
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:56,619
opening opening hitman is a disaster i when i finally got the game to run

737
02:00:56,619 --> 02:01:01,130
i couldn't leave it so this is going to be a nightmare

738
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:08,659
uh let me see if this works because the game specifically says

739
02:01:08,659 --> 02:01:17,539
do not open the game if steam vr is open see what happens it's such a mess

740
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:26,420
all right hold on play whatever you want i mean i kind of want to keep playing

741
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:36,699
this yeah i gotta exit steam vr hold on i have

742
02:01:36,699 --> 02:02:40,180
to restart steam all right i'm back here's the real

743
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:46,840
question i think i lost chat we're about to find out

744
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:50,569
because this was the biggest problem that i had with this setting this up was

745
02:02:50,569 --> 02:02:54,250
every time i opened up the thing that captures chat hitman would like run at

746
02:02:54,250 --> 02:03:07,689
two fps and crash let's see find out let us find out

747
02:03:07,689 --> 02:03:13,050
i'm back in vr there's not there's no wasp in here

748
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:17,560
all right there we go i should be good let me see if it's still on there can i

749
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:25,140
see you guys okay steam is opening vr

750
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:35,979
oh my god that's loud shit i lost chat oh please

751
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:42,710
you guys can't even see it this is the exact same problem i had last time

752
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:45,430
i'm probably have to change games because this took like two hours to set

753
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:49,020
up uh and now i physically can't even get

754
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:57,210
what the fuck man fucking phd to play hitman 3 in vr

755
02:03:57,210 --> 02:04:02,090
can i see it come on please load load please

756
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:08,199
do it i think i lost the chat i can't play with chat

757
02:04:08,199 --> 02:04:18,229
if i'm gonna play hitman wait let me try this technically it's

758
02:04:18,229 --> 02:04:27,270
running shit yeah i can't see chat anymore

759
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:32,569
and it's gonna be a huge pain in the ass to get it back or maybe it's not hold on

760
02:04:32,569 --> 02:04:45,050
give me one more second where are my hands oh come on uh

761
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:57,369
oh this is gonna take like an hour to fix play squid game

762
02:04:57,369 --> 02:05:02,630
next game i'm gonna change games i may have lost the chat for the rest of the

763
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:06,520
stream by the way because that was a monumental pain in

764
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:12,229
the ass to get that to work especially with hitman it's like a

765
02:05:12,229 --> 02:05:18,199
fucking nightmare to try to get it to work with this on index for some reason

766
02:05:18,199 --> 02:05:22,039
let me try one more thing why does everything that launches on day one not

767
02:05:22,039 --> 02:05:29,909
fucking ever work the way that's supposed to because i

768
02:05:29,909 --> 02:05:35,500
have like access to this i don't know why i can't open it

769
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:41,050
and it technically should be hold on a sec come on come on come on come on

770
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:49,510
come on come on come on let me see it fuck i have to

771
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:56,420
why do i have to redo the whole thing in this overlay

772
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:59,460
all right if this takes more than one full minute

773
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:02,739
