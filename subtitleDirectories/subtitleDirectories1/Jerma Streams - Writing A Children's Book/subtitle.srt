1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:15,029
Hello everybody. Okay, give me a moment while I set this up. I should be able to do this.

2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,259
I spy or we're all gonna leave. No, I have to write a children's book.

3
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:40,979
Doesn't mean we can't play I spy again. All right, let me uh, let's go. So if I do this,

4
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:59,219
I should be able to get this open. Close that. I remember when this was an I spy stream.

5
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:23,209
But, but yes, I spy goes away. But you do get like a on camera guy stream right now. I mean,

6
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:33,459
we've got a guy on camera writing children's book. I don't know. I don't know. So I need paint.

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:44,579
I need notepad. I got to block this out. I'm not going to do this like stupid. I'm not going to

8
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,099
be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to make noises. I don't make noises. Okay.

9
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:58,329
Don't be naked on this camera. Please don't be naked on the camera for one frame. In fact,

10
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:08,780
I'm going to like open it here to make sure it's not right. I think we're okay. Can you see me?

11
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,169
No, not yet. Good. Good. I don't want you to see me yet. I'm not ready for my like close up.

12
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:27,740
All right, let's go down here. Let's grab a window. Let's get the paint window,

13
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:42,620
which there it is. Let's get it nice and clean looking. Those of you think that I'm messing

14
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:53,689
around, I'm actually going to do this. This is not me fucking around. Sometimes we make jokes and

15
00:02:53,689 --> 00:03:01,050
sometimes we write whole children's books on stream. So I got this. I need like a notepad

16
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:09,830
to like to write the story. No, this is just to block it out. This is not blocking the scenes out.

17
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:18,069
Let's go with like a gray background though, because this is gonna, it's gonna like hurt

18
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:29,020
people's eyes. That's better. Steal my book and publish it. No, you can't do that because

19
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,949
right now you're ready for this. Everything in this stream from here on out going forward,

20
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:45,740
now I gotta be on camera. Okay. You ready? Was that, that was not like a naked frame, right?

21
00:03:49,110 --> 00:04:00,710
Okay. So everything on stream here for the remainder of the stream here, I am copyright

22
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:08,219
trademarking the next three hours of the stream. All characters, all original characters and all

23
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,930
text written and created by me, Germa985 on the channel Germa985 will henceforth be under my

24
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:24,860
property. So here's what we're going to do. Because I don't want to get myself in any trouble. That's

25
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,579
not how it works. Yes it does. I have documented proof. I have a fucking email I sent myself at

26
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:37,610
fucking six o'clock in the afternoon. Why did I just look into the camera like that? That was weird.

27
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,259
Okay. So I sent an email to myself. This is now copyrighted to mine and I did it first.

28
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,689
So let's go over some characters here because this is important. I'm going to throw out a

29
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,769
few phrases and you guys tell me if they've been made into children's books. I'm going to change

30
00:04:53,769 --> 00:05:00,310
the title too. That's a good, that's a good point. I'm going to change the title to writing a

31
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:13,560
children's book. This is people are going to come in. Writing a children's book. Is it children?

32
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,939
How do you spell children's? Like children apostrophe S like a children's book or is it

33
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:29,029
children's book? Yeah. Okay. But IRL, what would it, what is this even categorized as?

34
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,410
What is it? What is this? Just chatting? It kind of, I don't know, creative,

35
00:05:43,240 --> 00:06:01,060
science and technology, special event, education, creator verse. No, that's like a fucking,

36
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:13,430
that's like a now defunct Minecraft clone, isn't it? I'm just going to put it under,

37
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,540
I can't put this into art. I can't. People are going to come and be fucking angry at this stream.

38
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,220
They're going to be like, who's, who's like, oh, like, oh, a nice art stream. You're drawing

39
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:39,430
like fucking children's stick figures. Dick. It is art. All right. Fine. It's going to art.

40
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:51,319
And that is a misleading title. Whatever. It's dumb. All right. We are now in a different

41
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,160
category of writing a children's book. So here, this is very important. Incredibly important.

42
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Number one, I'm going to throw out some characters names. I'm going to throw some characters like

43
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,959
animals and other worldly special effect type creatures. And you tell me if they've been made

44
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,639
into a book before, like a creature book. Okay. Ready? Scenario one. Scary monster that's in the

45
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,040
closet. That's it. That's hiding under the bed or in the closet, right? A person is scared,

46
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,279
but the book is about how the monster just wants a snack late at night from the fridge.

47
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:30,139
Like Munchy the monster just wants a snack. Has it been done? Been done. Been done. Okay. Like

48
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:39,980
monster wants to like, go get a snack and it's late at night and he's hungry. I was sure about

49
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:51,180
this because that's a good idea. Okay. So you've done it before. So you've done it before. All

50
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,379
right. Small animal needs help doing basic human activities. That's a big one for a lot of these,

51
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:08,300
right? So you've got like mouse needs help tying shoes. It's been done before. Small

52
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:16,100
rat learns how to ride a bike. Been done? That may have been done. Give a mouse a cookie. That's

53
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,610
right. Okay. We can't do that one. Ratatouille. Yeah. But does Ratatouille learn how to ride a

54
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:40,899
bike? No. So Ratatouille in the movie does not learn how to ride a bike. Okay. Okay. So that's

55
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,970
a D. He does ride a bike. I can't throw that one in the trash. Okay. So what about, um,

56
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,639
there's another, another view. That's the route we can go down. Well, we'll vote on it.

57
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,799
So we'll put it up on the screen here. So we got small animal doing basic human children's task.

58
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:06,250
Okay. I'm going to call that option two. So let me write that out. So we've got small animal. It's

59
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:18,220
great. Doing basic children's tasks. Put it in bold. Cause I like that. All right. Can we,

60
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:27,610
can I make that bigger? I don't know. How the fuck do I even do that? Okay. So this is that,

61
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:35,539
that is that option. So now we've got, I really liked the idea of something that is scary. Like

62
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:41,460
is another thing, right? Something that is scary, but is shown over the course of like the 15 pages

63
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,620
to not be scary. We're talking dentist. We're talking doctor. We're talking, uh, haircut,

64
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,139
go to the haircut. Has it been a haircut book? Scary haircut, but it's not, it's had these been

65
00:09:53,139 --> 00:10:10,200
done. All right. But things, things that are, would you fucking let me write this things that

66
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:21,190
are scary to a child, but actually not. Right. Well, actually the dentist is fucking scary. I

67
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,649
haven't been in like three years. So that's, I don't know if I agree with that one. I take the

68
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:32,649
dent, take, take dentists off the list because that's scary. Okay. Uh, we got things that are

69
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,940
scary to a child, but actually not small animal doing basic children's tasks. Uh, we've got

70
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:46,519
learning, right? So like counting, uh, alphabet. I mean, this has been done a lot. They're like

71
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:53,000
a for alligator B for bear, like that, read that kind of thing. Learning, learning material,

72
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:03,480
not super fond of that, but we can, we keep it there. Okay. So there's learning material,

73
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,840
things that are scary to it, but they're not small animal doing basic children's tasks. Or

74
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:22,039
I think we don't want to get too fussy here though. Do the dentist book so I can convince

75
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:39,350
myself that the dentist is not scary. That's really funny, but not today. All right. Learning

76
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:46,279
material, small animal doing basic. Okay. How about growing up, right? There's things you need

77
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,909
to know, like how to fucking write a check. The child learns, right? Think growing up,

78
00:11:52,470 --> 00:12:01,289
writing a check, doing laundry, um, bathroom, like going to the bathroom. There's a shit load

79
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:15,529
of those books growing, like go into the bathroom. So we got growing up things that are scary to a

80
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:21,129
child, but are not small animal doing basic children's tasks, learning material, growing up.

81
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,210
Um, what else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else?

82
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,570
You guys got me how to do taxes. That's not for, that's not a children's book.

83
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:48,019
Uh, dealing like with, with consequences, like, like the wizard of Oz, that was a,

84
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,269
that was a hilarious children's book, right? Go into like the wizard of Oz. That would have,

85
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,309
what a hysterical trip that was when they met the lion and the dog.

86
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:10,649
Got to keep it simple. Things kids should not do, but I think that goes into, yeah, like, but that

87
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:18,899
growing up kind of fits that category too. How to deal cards. Kids aren't going to dealers.

88
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:33,299
How to play Fortnite. Don't make me write that. I think these are good. I think this is good.

89
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:40,009
I think we got to the basic four here. Or, you know, there also is just like for fun,

90
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,230
like the cat in the hat, the cat in the hat didn't have a fucking message. A cat shows up

91
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,120
and breaks a bunch of shit in their house and like does a bunch of drugs. The cat in the hat

92
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:02,309
has no act, does the cat in the hat have an actual meaning? The cat in the hat had a meaning. I don't

93
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:14,570
remember that. It's about responsibility. Okay. Um, James and the giant peach. A giant peach

94
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,940
rolls into New York and like fucking catamari meatballs in front of James and he gets on it.

95
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,899
And then like, they go on a funny adventure. That was it. He meets like a bunch of bugs.

96
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:46,740
That's the, what was that one? It was about friendship. Got it. Uh, friendship or love.

97
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,879
Okay. Friendship or love. I'm going to block this out too. I'm getting, I'm getting a flow chart.

98
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:03,110
We're going to have like 17 different scenarios. We're going to like just be ready to write the

99
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,110
book and then I'm going to go to bed. Okay. I'm going to look at all this material that we got.

100
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:18,120
All right. See you tomorrow. Is he doing the bit yet? This is not a bit. What bit? I told you one

101
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,879
guy said that I've got, you can't write it. You never got to write a children's book. You're not

102
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:28,600
talented. And I said, what the fuck? All right. I think we're good. So things that are scary to

103
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,379
a child, but not small animal doing basic children's tasks, learning material, growing up

104
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:46,539
friendship or love, or like a learning, like teaching or learning a lesson. Right. But I guess

105
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:52,090
that could be growing, growing, growing up or no, cause that like going to the bathroom is not like

106
00:15:52,090 --> 00:16:03,320
learning how to do something. No, learning a lesson could be anything. Right. So I'm going

107
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:14,700
to move these around. How do you even, how do you select something? Oops. How do I do this?

108
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:28,490
How do I grab this? All right. Yeah. You just don't. Okay. So just make sure you click in the

109
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:43,320
right spot. So we got, we're almost ready to start here. What do you guys think? Let me get out of

110
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:57,019
the way. And by the way, this does not dictate exactly what we're doing. This is just like a,

111
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:06,740
what do you guys think? Write a book about the bear? No, it's got to be, it has to be very simple.

112
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:29,220
Where, where's my click thing? All right. What do you think? Hold on. You can't see them. Okay.

113
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,660
It looks like a lot of people gravitating towards small animal doing basic children's tasks.

114
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,130
Once we pick one, we have to be damn sure that it doesn't exist already.

115
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,369
We're going to write out like every basic children's tasks that I can think of

116
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:04,259
small animal going to the dentist, like biting the guy's hand. No, we can't put that in.

117
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,099
All right. I would probably gravitate. What do you want to do? Edit colors?

118
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,890
I'm not going to paint with 3d. So someone said mix them all together. So we've got a

119
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,250
learning material, a math book about a small animal doing a basic task,

120
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,569
something that's scary, but it's not learning a lesson at the end and growing a little

121
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:38,819
and finding a friend along the way. I'll be a millionaire in a few years.

122
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:46,519
It's a small animal doing basically, let's, let's, let's get this shit out of my face.

123
00:18:46,519 --> 00:19:02,380
All of it. I don't want to leave and look at it. Oh, that doesn't look right. It looks even worse.

124
00:19:03,099 --> 00:20:29,240
How do I, how do I do that? How do you delete text? I got shit to do. Okay. Okay. So we,

125
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I don't, I don't use paint to draw like in like the black marker and that's it.

126
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:47,420
All right. So we got easy. I'm going to eat. What was it? The task. So we've got tasks

127
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,380
that are a basic human tasks that an animal is going to do. I got one for you right now.

128
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,500
Lawn care. Okay. Forget about the animal because we got to pick one that hasn't happened yet.

129
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:19,740
Lawn care, basic human task, laundry, cleaning, cleaning the house like a duck that cleans the

130
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:30,220
house. That's pretty good. Or a very large animal that's cleaning the house. And you think that it's

131
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,660
funny because they bump into stuff and break stuff and then they have to clean that up too.

132
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,920
That's pretty funny. Oh, that's pretty funny. Like a, like a bowl has to clean like a bear,

133
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,519
turtle. Okay. What? No, no, no. Okay. Shopping. Like whether that's, uh, I'll make it clear.

134
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:14,569
Rocherie or otherwise. Okay. What else? Capitalism versus communism. We're talking

135
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:31,380
about like laundry here. No, doing homework. That's a basic task, right? Homework. Um,

136
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,660
reading, like learning to read, but that's kind of learning, but it's that's all a basic human thing.

137
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,619
Teaching like a fucking alien to read. It could be that doesn't have to be, it could be an alien.

138
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:52,359
This could be the first alien, uh, children's book. Cooking. We've got lawn care, laundry,

139
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,109
cleaning, shopping, homework, reading, cooking, uh, eating healthy. Pretty, yeah, that's pretty

140
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:10,259
basic stuff. Hiding a body. You want this thing to sell or do you want me to like get in trouble?

141
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,980
Computer, computers. Ooh, we got a whole new generation of kids that are going to be on

142
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:38,789
computers and iPads, computers and tablets. Like a rat with a computer, like a mouse will get the

143
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:47,990
fuck out of here. A mouse on the mouse. Has it, no one's done it. Has somebody done like a computer

144
00:23:47,990 --> 00:24:03,059
kids learning, like fun, like kids computer mouse with a mouse? No, they haven't. No, they haven't.

145
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,369
We'll get the mouse a headset too and it'll be like talking because that's people are going to be

146
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:14,680
talking on headsets. These kids are growing up with the fucking technology. ABC mouse is already

147
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:28,819
a thing and that's what they do. Is that real? ABC mouse isn't a book. It's yeah, it's an online

148
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:40,579
fucking web media portal. Yes, it is. Game. Okay. Keep that in mind. Keep like, okay, I'm going to

149
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:47,859
just make sure I don't forget this. Possible gaming mouse. No, no, no, not gaming mouse. Fucking

150
00:24:47,859 --> 00:25:05,880
computer mouse. Computer mouse. You know what I mean here. Okay. So we've got computers and tablets,

151
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:19,059
possible computer mouse. Farms. Out on the farm. Right. I know there's a few that already exist,

152
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:35,609
but it's okay. We can have our own different one. Basic human task. No, skateboarding is not

153
00:25:35,609 --> 00:26:01,349
basic. It's hard. Self-defense class. That's not dancing, but that's, yeah, you know, dance. Okay.

154
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:15,480
Dancing. Let me fix that. Dancing is possible. Crypto investing. Construction. No, I don't know

155
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:24,009
anything about construction. General like housework. No, that's like kind of cleaning.

156
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:42,170
Gardening. I would put that under lawn care. Hygiene. Yeah. Hygiene is a good one. Hygiene.

157
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:53,960
I don't know if I spelled that right. Who gives a shit. How to steal things from work. Manners.

158
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,930
Basic. Very basic human thing. Yeah. They always have like, oh, it's a fucking monster that doesn't

159
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:09,369
know manners. A monster that doesn't understand manners and needs to be taught manners by the

160
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:24,900
family. Has it happened? Why does everything, including a monster, had to have happened in

161
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:34,819
Monster's Ink already? Teaching a monster manners. Teaching a monster hygiene. Like a monster doesn't

162
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:41,559
brush its teeth. A monster does not brush its teeth. And there'd be a really cute panel of them both.

163
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,960
You know, like it could be like a little girl, like just barely being able to see above the sink,

164
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,960
like brushing the teeth. There's a huge monster like brushing and there's like soap all over his

165
00:27:49,960 --> 00:28:00,819
mouth. And he brushes his teeth with the soap because he didn't know. That literally happens

166
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:31,960
in Monster's Ink. That's been done thousands of times. I don't believe you. Hold on. Monster's

167
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,759
Ink brushing teeth. God damn it. He does brush. He brushes his fucking teeth in the mirror.

168
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:47,829
All right. Forget that one. No monsters and hygiene. It's been done. Monsters and cooking.

169
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:56,619
They don't know how to cook. So monsters. What? No, no. We're going too far. Stop it. We're going

170
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:06,119
too far. Forget about the main character. Get the composition of the story first. Okay? Dancing

171
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:15,539
monsters. Haven't done that yet. So okay, we're getting to the point where we can pick.

172
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:29,210
I think this is good. So now over here, we are going to put people or things, right? Animals or

173
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:45,579
maybe not animals. We got rats. We got mouse. We've got alligator. We've got, we got monsters. We have

174
00:29:45,579 --> 00:30:04,839
aliens. We have a chipmunk. We've got duck, crabs, lobsters, mollusks. No, that's way too weird.

175
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:17,319
Kid doesn't know what a fucking mollusk is. Armadillo. Lobster modillo? That's not right.

176
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:37,210
How do I fix this? Lobster, armadillo, aardvark. Aardvark is pretty good. Frog. Frog

177
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:50,950
and toad are the same thing, by the way. A seagull. A germ. Oh, actually, you know what?

178
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:58,940
That's kind of funny. Like a germ that needs to learn how to eat healthy. A germ that needs to

179
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:06,359
learn how to cook. A germ that needs to learn hygiene. What? You know what I mean? Like what

180
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:21,880
the fuck? That's so weird. Not good enough. It's not good enough. Okay. Germ. A stove.

181
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:52,660
I thought about, okay. A bear. A turtle. I'm not writing gnome. It's not an animal. Cats. Yeah.

182
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,450
Cats. Dogs. All right. All right. Hold on. Slow down. Slow down. We don't want to get too crazy

183
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:06,460
here. Snake. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Rat, mouse, alligator, monster, alien,

184
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,859
chipmunk, dog, crab, lobster, armadillo, aardvark, frog, seagull, germ, bear, turtle, cat, dog, snake,

185
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:22,819
a cinder block. An animate object might be kind of interesting. We could pull a like a beauty

186
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:31,700
and the beast and then lose everything because Disney will DMCA claim my life. An elephant

187
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:42,220
learning how to fucking brush its teeth. That's pretty cute. Elephant. Spider. Whoa. Whoa. What?

188
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:49,130
I'm losing something here. What did we lose? All right. All right. That's enough. That's enough.

189
00:32:49,130 --> 00:33:03,029
That's enough. That's enough. Enough. I got it. No more. That's good. What was under elephant? I

190
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:20,019
don't even. Spider. All right. Spider is down here. Just remember that. So then in the middle here,

191
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:35,579
we are going to put a theme. Okay. A theme right here. The theme is going to go down here.

192
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:42,630
Oh, what the fuck? So if you can, if you've got a rat doing laundry, what happens? You know what I

193
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:56,789
mean? We've got aliens doing homework, but what's the theme? Where are like, we need like a setting.

194
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:04,650
That's important. Setting. Just throw them out here. I'll take, I'll take a few of them.

195
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:20,230
Like setting. Okay. You, the, no, but the United States is way too vague. Like the kitchen or

196
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:40,219
like a home, right? A house. Okay. College. Like in college. The playground, right? Like we're outside

197
00:34:41,099 --> 00:35:00,360
in the garden at space in the, on the moon, on the moon, on the sun in space,

198
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:23,179
in VR, in olive garden, in a restaurant, in a restaurant. I don't, who cares? On a cinderblock

199
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,170
and a castle. That's a good one. Nice. Excellent work in the school, right? Like in the school,

200
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,530
we're like learning how to like read in school. We're learning how to clean in school. Okay.

201
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:57,739
In underwater. Okay. School and underwater school. I'm liking it. Not in the casino,

202
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:10,820
not in prison, in the sky, on a cloud, on a cloud, like on Mount Olympus or something, right?

203
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:25,989
In the, in the dirt. No, in the grass. Well, we've got, we got garden, right? In the garden.

204
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:45,829
I think we got some good ones. In the wild west. That's not a bad setting. It's like, you know,

205
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:57,579
like the cactuses, the cacti, the sun. It could work. Set the book in hell. I don't think that's

206
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:07,539
going to work. At the beach. Nobody said the beach yet. Come on. The beach. What's perfect

207
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:23,380
for half of these? At the amusement park. Yep. Like the theme park. No. Yeah. Theme park. Like

208
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:50,619
an amusement park. At the, but the fair could be the theme park. On a mountain. Okay. In a graveyard.

209
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:56,619
I don't know. Graveyard might be a little too scary. I think graveyard would be too scary,

210
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,460
I think. But like maybe it'd be possible. Like at the graveyard. Maybe you could like make it

211
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,230
like a Halloween theme. You can make like a Halloween theme children's book. It's like,

212
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:20,139
ooh, like we're at the graveyard and okay. Now like the mall. Okay. I think this is good

213
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:25,719
because I'm going to show you what we're going to do now because this is important. The zoo. Oh,

214
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:39,300
you've got it right at the end there. The zoo. The zoo. The zoo. The farm. I can't forget the farm.

215
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:50,780
So here's what we're going to do. We're going to play a game called each one of these is getting

216
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,510
a number and they're going to be thrown into a random number generator and we're going to pull

217
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,909
them up. So for instance, category one will be numbered category two, category three,

218
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:07,619
and we're going to just pull them fucking out randomly. That's the plan. So let's go ahead

219
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:16,900
and do that. I think, I think this is good. Let me, I think that's it. Right now. Like anybody,

220
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:32,809
anybody else see one at the hospital? That could work. Okay. Two for it. What the fuck?

221
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:41,500
I got to move this though. Okay. So we have, let's see what we've got for numbers here. I'm

222
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,980
just going to do this very, very easily. I need to open up like random number generator.

223
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:56,059
So we need to generate numbers. So we need to number these. This is one,

224
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:06,170
two for it. Who's that? What kid is going to know what the fuck two for it is? So we've got one,

225
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:13,289
two. Let's just number them just to do it. Uh, with the, where's like a crayon? Just give me a crayon.

226
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:35,750
So we've got, who cares? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

227
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:52,469
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not, that's the same category. Delete that. 11, 12, 13, 14.

228
00:40:52,469 --> 00:41:00,389
I'm just realizing it's very possible we're going to get like a seagull at the zoo out on the farm

229
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:11,829
or like a crab on a cloud eating healthy. Oh, this is going to get fucking weird. I love it.

230
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:32,679
Set the book here. What is this? Oh God. Me brushing my teeth. That's so cute.

231
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,000
A seagull in the hospital in the wild west. Some of these are going to be hard to do,

232
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:50,739
but I'm going to do them. Okay. So we got one, two, three, 14 things. Fucking God damn it. One, two,

233
00:41:52,389 --> 00:42:20,809
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 18. That settings are themes.

234
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:35,369
There's so many of these. One, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine. It's hard to do this.

235
00:42:36,579 --> 00:43:03,429
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. And spider is 21. 21 is spider. Okay.

236
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:27,059
You mislabeled the activities. Aliens at school. Otherwise. It's too late. I can't fucking fix it.

237
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:38,099
I don't care. Are you ready? So here we go. Kat, let's get a number generator over here.

238
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:58,139
Let me get it. Hold on. I got random.org. This is truly just random. Let's get a good image of

239
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:15,750
that on screen. Where is this? Oops. No, I should be able to get a nice box here. One second. Bear

240
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:26,199
with me here. Otherwise. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm doing like, I'm doing like fucking skexy neck. I

241
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:37,900
got to like straighten up. You know, they're remaking the dark crystal. Why is Kobayashi

242
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:47,260
versus giant bear still here? Okay. Random.org. There it is. Well, you can't see it, but there

243
00:44:47,260 --> 00:45:04,570
it is. Where the fuck? No, that's, that's just not right. Is it? There we go. Okay. Let's make it so

244
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:11,610
it's nice and prominent. So, you know, I'm not fucking faking any of these because I could fake

245
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:29,110
them. We're not faking it. All right. Here we go. You can still see everything, right? I'll get the

246
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:36,500
fuck out of the way a little bit too. Here we go. So we got, this is for category one. Category one

247
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:43,480
there's a 14 different responses, right? So no, no, no, we need to do category, no, no,

248
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,480
category three first. So that's 21. We need to find out what we're working with. So we're

249
00:45:47,480 --> 00:46:05,860
working with one of the 21. Here we go. Bingo. 19. We've got a snake, a snake on a cloud,

250
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:20,539
snake on a cloud. Otherwise. We're going to stick on a cloud. Otherwise. How do you make that a book?

251
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,760
Uh, so let's write it down. We got snake on a cloud. We're going to do this like 10 times.

252
00:46:44,760 --> 00:47:02,070
We picked the best one. Snake on a cloud. Otherwise is the first one. This is an ugly fucking

253
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:08,949
text here. Here we go. Let's do it again. We got, uh, we're going to go same category one,

254
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:29,059
one out of 21. County, the next possible option, uh, a seagull, a seagull at the beach,

255
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:44,579
seagull at the beach. Oh, seagull at the beach learning manners. Cause holy fuck man. Seagulls

256
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,139
perfect. Seagulls are assholes. They're eating people's like french fries and they're like

257
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:56,739
flying over, shitting on people at the beach. Oh my God. Somebody gave a lot of money. That's

258
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:03,239
perfect. A seagull at the beach learning manners because they're fucking, they're like flying rats

259
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,679
and they're, they're, they, they like eat people. They're like vultures. Oh, I like that one. But

260
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:19,460
somebody gave a lot of money. Uh, La Cranda just gave 50 bucks. Thank you so much for the $50

261
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:26,920
La Cranda. Snakes on a cloud sounds like a good sequel to snakes on a train. Snakes on a plane.

262
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:37,480
So, all right. Thank you so fucking much for the $50. It's a huge amount of money.

263
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:46,070
My God. Snakes on a plane clouds snakes on a cloud. Otherwise. I like this one a lot. This is

264
00:48:46,070 --> 00:49:03,000
great. Seagulls at the beach learning manners. Perfect. Let's move it over here. We're going to

265
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
do this like another six, six or seven times. We didn't spend like 35 minutes making this.

266
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:23,639
We only do it once. You get the fucking idea. All right. Let's do it again. Next category.

267
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,400
I know you can't see it. Don't worry. I'll move it. No. Oh yeah. Well, I'll move out of the way

268
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:37,099
in a second. There's a lot of possible outcomes here. We have to see a lot of them because I'm

269
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:53,159
going to vote on which one's the one. Here we go. Animal or thing. 21. We got nine. Lobsters.

270
00:49:54,409 --> 00:50:10,420
Lobsters. Pretty good start. Lobsters in a restaurant. It's writing itself.

271
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:22,940
Doing homework. Lobsters in a restaurant doing homework. And at the end of the book,

272
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:45,159
they get like dropped into the boiling water. Uh, no, that's I don't know. I don't want to write

273
00:50:45,159 --> 00:51:02,340
that one. Uh, lobsters in the restaurant doing homework. The seagull book already exists. No,

274
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:29,289
it doesn't. If that fucking book exists, I'm going to have a meltdown. Greedy, naughty seagull at the

275
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:35,179
beach. James is a little bear who happens to save a seagull that has some behavioral problems. One

276
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,340
day James goes fishing with the seagull. James is disappointed with the bird's display of greed

277
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,739
when she eats nearly all the catches. James replaces the fish by spending his pocket money

278
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,820
to buy fish for the at the beach seagull being greedy at the beach, not knowing manners.

279
00:51:48,699 --> 00:52:18,889
Delete it. Uh, snake on a cloud. Otherwise lobster, lobster at the restaurant. But you

280
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:24,280
understand how this one can't be done that the lobster is at the restaurant. They're like the

281
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:37,539
food at the restaurant. So it's going to be dark. This one can't be done. Lobster at the restaurant

282
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:46,869
doing homework. And then they get like eaten. Like they're at, what are they doing at the restaurant?

283
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:54,250
Okay. Well, I got it written down. Let's do it again. One, two, 21, 16. We've got turtles

284
00:52:54,250 --> 00:53:12,199
or a turtle. A turtle at the zoo. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry.

285
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:27,429
That's very, very easy. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Okay. We'll do it again. We got, we got

286
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:38,360
four and one of them I can't do. Three of them I can't do. Uh, we've got a bear. So that's bear

287
00:53:42,869 --> 00:54:01,269
at the zoo. You fucking better not be doing laundry. Learning manners. Bear at the zoo

288
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:14,809
learning manners. That's a, that one's a resident sleeper. Okay. Only like a few more and then we'll

289
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:32,309
move on from here. This is, we've got monsters. Monsters. Monsters in a castle. Does it know

290
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:46,699
that I'm trying to do this? Monsters in a castle dancing. That's not bad. Monsters in a castle

291
00:54:46,699 --> 00:55:02,219
dancing. Okay. What else we got? I want 10. That's one, two, three, four, five, six. That's called

292
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:06,300
Shrek. Now, but Shrek was one monster. This is multiple monsters. All like a ball or something.

293
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:30,440
All right. 120. Let's go. 13. Seagull again. A seagull underwater eating healthy. An underwater

294
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:45,530
seagull eating healthy. He might have scuba gear on, right? That's possible. It'd be funny

295
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,769
if he had to hold his breath and go underwater. Don't they have to do that anyways? To like eat

296
00:55:49,769 --> 00:56:13,000
fish? This is going to get messy. I got to shrink these. Seagull underwater eating healthy. I got

297
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:28,739
the font has to be smaller. This is too big. Okay. Three more. Let's get a good animal here.

298
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:47,530
We've got two seagulls. Alligator. An alligator at the beach. What are you doing at the beach?

299
00:56:49,460 --> 00:57:06,679
Reading. Learning how to read. That one sucks. How do you make a coherent story with an alligator

300
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:23,000
learning how to read on the beach or just reading on the beach? That one sucks. All right. Two more.

301
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:52,940
An aardvark at school. Aardvark at school. Thank God. Doing homework. This is a copywritten

302
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,659
character already. We have to trash this one. That's an aardvark at school doing homework.

303
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:01,340
There was a PBS show that ran for like 40 years about that exact topic.

304
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:12,820
That one's vetoed. I'm not even going to write it down. Cats. We got a cat or multiple cats

305
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:41,420
at the zoo. Cats at the zoo. Otherwise. Great. Fucking hell. All right. Vetoed Arthur,

306
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:52,469
so I got to do another one. 20. That's an elephant. Elephant in the wild west.

307
00:58:52,469 --> 00:59:09,460
This could be good. Reading. An elephant in the wild west learning how to read.

308
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:34,019
Fucking reading. I'll write it down. I wish we got shopping. They're all over the place,

309
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:44,340
but don't worry. I got a system. All right. Three more and we're done. Aliens. No matter what they

310
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:48,340
are, I'm going to keep them. Even if they're copywritten, even if it's Mickey Mouse learns

311
00:59:48,340 --> 01:00:02,619
to read, I'm going to keep it. So we get aliens in a restaurant. Aliens in a restaurant. What are

312
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:09,929
they doing there? Cleaning. They're teaching aliens cleaning a restaurant. They don't know

313
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:32,980
anything about like humans and they can like learn. Watching them eat. Humans. Humans.

314
01:00:37,179 --> 01:01:27,820
Eating humans. It's Twilight Zone level. Snakes. I didn't know. I put my head down and snorted.

315
01:01:27,820 --> 01:02:39,110
God damn it. What's the next one? Okay. We've got aliens. Why? Oh, I don't like this. What are they

316
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:55,289
doing? They're on a mountain observing humans. Aliens on a mountain cleaning.

317
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:21,079
Okay. Aliens on. Where did that go? What are they cleaning? I don't know. That's just predator.

318
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:59,139
Okay. Elephants. Elephants in space. Elephants in space. This is great so far. Elephants in space.

319
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:10,170
What are they doing though? Something cool. Come on. Give us a good one. Oh that means they're dead.

320
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:47,429
That means they're dead. Elephants in space. Out on the farm as they say. All right. I gotta go.

321
01:04:47,429 --> 01:05:07,400
I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. Only like one more of these fucking things.

322
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:17,590
We have so many categories already. All right. We got an armadillo. No. Fuck it. Ready? Lightning

323
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,469
round. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. What are you gonna get? What are we gonna get?

324
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:26,309
Something, something, something, something. Nine lobsters. Lobsters. I wonder where they're

325
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:35,239
gonna be. Lobsters on a mountain. Lobsters on a mountain. There they go. Where are they? What's

326
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:47,639
the plan here? They're shopping. I can work with all this. I can work with it. Last one and we're

327
01:05:47,639 --> 01:06:01,079
moving on. We have to block something out here. We've got a turtle. Turtle in a restaurant. There's

328
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:14,570
so many in a restaurant. Shopping in a restaurant. For what? One more and then we have to do

329
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:30,010
elimination. This is the final one. Absolutely no questions asked. Last one. A seagull on a cloud.

330
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:55,239
Seagull on a cloud doing lawn care or gardening. Okay. That's one more. Last one. Last. This is

331
01:06:55,239 --> 01:07:02,679
actually the last one. No questions asked. Final one. That's a duck. No, no, no, no, no, no. That

332
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:26,940
was a duck. I got duck on the farm learning computers and tablets and that's it. That's

333
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:33,659
fucking it. I gotta get these together. I gotta get out of here. Okay, here we go. We can close

334
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:54,280
out of this. All right, so this is a mess. I gotta clean these up. Okay, clean them up. Doesn't

335
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,199
matter how they look. We just gotta get them in the right spot. We gotta start eliminating them.

336
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:18,460
Right here. Alligator reading on the beach. Duck on a farm learning computers.

337
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:27,689
Seagull on a cloud learning lawn care. Aliens in a restaurant observing humans and cleaning while

01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:34,979

01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:42,659
wild west. Aliens on a mountain cleaning. Elephants in space on the farm. Lobsters shopping on a

340
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:51,829

01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:12,380
Monsters in a castle dancing and seagull underwater eating healthy. This is very messy.

343
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:25,539
I gotta get a notepad open. Nobody can read this. This hurts. This looks like a glitch in a computer

344
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:32,140
game. This looks like you just grabbed the N64 cartridge and fucking pulled it out halfway through

345
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:47,979
your game. All right, let me get a like actual notepad because this shit ain't gonna work.

346
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:57,739
Notepad. A rich rich text document is also good. Let me get that off the screen before somebody

347
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:09,720
fucking throws up. Where am I? No, I don't know. I'm all squished. Go back to normal. There we go.

353
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:17,510
answers move on and then I'm gonna fucking decide which one. Uh, let's get one over here.

354
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,739
Okay, uh, so let me get, I'm gonna just condense these so they're easier because there's a bunch

376
01:16:52,859 --> 01:17:03,050
We're ready. That's it, right? I didn't miss any. We have a straw poll already. Well, I made the

377
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:19,880
official one. It's already done. Great poll. Somebody made it 10 minutes ago. Uh, just use

378
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:32,199
the official one. Top five, move on. And then whatever the top five are, I'm going to determine

379
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:51,850
which one I'm going to write a book about. Since we're voting on this, we get writing credit. How

380
01:17:51,850 --> 01:18:01,979
many people are here? 5,068 people. It's going to be like a, it's going to be like a Kickstarter.

381
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:06,500
All right. The book is going to be like 200 pages long because it's going to be like

382
01:18:07,539 --> 01:18:20,810
12 pages for the book and then 195 pages for the Kickstarter credits. All right. Let's see

383
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:26,539
what we got here. Uh, we got the aliens from outer space observing humans in restaurant and cleaning

386
01:18:51,529 --> 01:19:11,460
There you go. Let's see what's at the bottom. Let's see what nobody wanted. Turtle at the zoo

387
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:20,899
doing laundry has 19 votes out of 1400 people that clicked it. Holy shit. Nobody wants to see that

388
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:25,939
one. Uh, it's what's with the turtles. What's with the hatred versus the turtle? Turtle in a

389
01:19:25,939 --> 01:19:30,260
restaurant shopping and turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Fucking nobody clicked on them.

390
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:38,739
Although they, they, they do suck. So not turtles, but like the restaurant shopping and like the

391
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:47,670
category didn't come out that well. Also lobsters in space, odd on the farm. I'm surprised it's this

392
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:58,359
low. That's just elephants are dead. We've got the aliens from outer space at a restaurant observing

393
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:05,180
humans and cleaning snake on cloud. Otherwise duck on the farm. See, all right. You got like 30

394
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:43,899
seconds. Okay. This is artwork. That's really good. Look at that. It's already fucking there for you.

395
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:59,750
That's already made for you. It's already here. That's already cover art. How do you make it so

396
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:20,229
fast? All right. 10 seconds and the poll closes. And then I monsters in a castle dancing is down

397
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:31,500
there in the middle. So we've got the top five. Thank you for voting. Uh, I'm going to write just

398
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,460
to make sure they have them. We've got aliens from outer space in a restaurant observing humans

399
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:41,579
and cleaning snake on a cloud. Otherwise duck on the farm, learning computers, seagull on a cloud,

400
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:48,840
doing lawn care, seagull underwater, eating healthy. I think I could work with some of those

401
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:12,539
seagull underwater. Okay. Here we go. I am going to put these new poll, new poll. Let's get a new

402
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:20,659
poll going. This is the final five. Just make it a short story. Yeah. It's going to be like

403
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:45,699
10 pages long. Write them all and then do a crossover like the Avengers. No. Okay. Snake

404
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:50,619
on the cloud. The snake one. No, that's another thing. We have to make sure that of these top

405
01:22:50,619 --> 01:23:00,810
five, they don't exist already. Is there a duck on a farm learning computers? Because if there is,

406
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:14,630
it can't be done. We tried our best to make original content. All right. We've narrowed

407
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:22,619
it down and then I get to have my vote, which is worth 600 votes. So just be aware. All right.

408
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:25,579
Here's the final poll. I'm going to take a piss while you guys vote on this last one.

409
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:44,939
There it is. And then it's time to start writing the book, doing lawn care. I'll be right back.

410
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:53,989
I'm going to pee. Good luck. And then I'm going to start blocking the book out and they're doing

411
01:23:53,989 --> 01:26:07,020
panels. Are we reaching a consensus? No. Yes. No. Okay. Duck friends, computer chase. What is this?

412
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:21,619
Give me the middle finger. All right. It looks like at the moment here, we got snake on a cloud

413
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:32,539
otherwise is currently the winner. Snake on a cloud. Otherwise. Jesus Christ. How the fuck am

414
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:38,149
I going to write a book about this? Duck on the farm learning computers. It could have been

415
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:50,649
seagull on a cloud doing lawn care. What the fuck does that mean? Snake on a cloud. Otherwise.

416
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:11,779
This one keeps turning me upside down. Okay. But how did you get up there? All right. It's time.

417
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:26,420
I think it's time to figure it out. So here we go. Let's block it out. This is it. Snake on a cloud.

418
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:38,140
Otherwise. It's going to be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.

419
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:44,699
How's he going to get down? How did he get up there? What? Brilliant. What did I just say?

420
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:47,819
What did I say? Clip that. Somebody clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Right now.

421
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:53,909
Clip that. Right now. Give it to me. Give it to me. What I just said. I don't remember, but it was

422
01:27:53,909 --> 01:28:12,569
good. That was good. Let's block it out. This is it. Snake on a cloud. I rhymed it. Otherwise.

423
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:21,720
It's going to be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. Doesn't care. Got up on a cloud

424
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,119
somehow. How's he going to get down? How did he get up there? Fucking brilliant. That's the opening

425
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:34,229
line. How's he going to get? That doesn't care. Snake. This is a story about a snake that doesn't

426
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:42,470
care. That doesn't care. Got up on a cloud. Got up on a cloud. How did he get there?

427
01:28:45,579 --> 01:28:49,260
Write that down. So make sure everybody writes that down. But no, me. Oh, me write that down

428
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:59,180
because it's my book. What did I say again? I repeat that again. What was it? It's going to

429
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:07,930
be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. There once was a snake that didn't care. Got up

430
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:13,529
on a cloud somehow. How did he get up there? What did I just say? What did I say? Clip that.

431
01:29:13,529 --> 01:29:16,569
Somebody clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Right now. Clip that. Right now. Give it to me.

432
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:25,989
But sometimes I just like just pure genius. All right. That's the opening line.

433
01:29:26,789 --> 01:29:31,130
When you get an opening line, that's how you get started. I don't care about the other categories.

434
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:39,819
This one wins. So we're going to do we're going to start with the it's flowing now. It's flowing.

435
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:48,100
Get back to where I was right here. Okay. Get all this out of here. I don't want to look at this.

436
01:29:48,579 --> 01:30:03,100
Okay. Let's block it out. So the first panel, first page, this is going to be this can be page

437
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:11,619
one. Okay. Page one is there once was a snake that didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.

438
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:21,029
How'd he get up there? That's a little too wordy. I think. Hold on. Page one. There once was a snake

439
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:41,500
that didn't care. That's page one. The cover comes later. Okay. This is page one. Easy words for

440
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:50,649
children. There once was a snake that did not care. This is not the layout. I just got to get

441
01:30:50,649 --> 01:31:01,130
it on the front first page. Huge fucking fun. And we'll block that out later. I got to get the

442
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:11,130
the basis of the first page. So here's what I'm thinking. So you've got I just Kramered. I'm sorry.

443
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:21,909
There once was a snake that did not care. We've got establish the perimeter here. We got

444
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,880
we got to look it up here like this. You know what I mean? I've seen the cloud and it's just

445
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:34,789
an establishing of the cloud. Like they're like fucking children right here. Take a look at this.

446
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:44,779
All right. I need the paint tool now. There's remember we need like 12 pages. Okay. So we

447
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:48,760
got the kids down here. They're like outside. Remember I'm going to I'm going to fucking

448
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:55,880
commission an artist. So we got I'm not an artist. Let's go with like okay. So up here we got like

449
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:01,699
cloud right because they're looking up. You can have a couple other clouds like over here

450
01:32:03,029 --> 01:32:07,430
in this section. Maybe a couple like over here in this section. This is the one the snakes are.

451
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:17,539
Don't fucking forget it. It's important. So maybe there's like a ball. There's a two. There's a ball

452
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:20,500
bouncing between. I got to just I got to get the action of the ball because I'll forget it.

453
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:34,260
There's a ball. No, no, no, no lower ball. Like like I just kicked it. You know what I mean?

454
01:32:38,779 --> 01:32:48,069
That's the ball. Then you've got let's have the we're going to stick figure because I can't draw

455
01:32:48,069 --> 01:33:01,430
anything. So you've got like one kid here. You know this like it's a kid. Right. This is I need

456
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:21,619
the kick of the ball. Right. Easy. Okay. Easy. It's fucking easy. And then another kid is like here.

457
01:33:22,579 --> 01:33:29,770
Easy. Maybe like catching a bit like oh I'm about to catch it. Like here it comes.

458
01:33:30,409 --> 01:33:41,819
Oh maybe like yeah. So the kid is about to catch the ball. They're very happy. Right. Like that's

459
01:33:41,819 --> 01:33:50,579
a good. This person looks like they're getting a ball kicked to their face. They don't look very

460
01:33:50,579 --> 01:34:09,130
happy. Well he doesn't. But look I fixed it. So this is the playing of the ball. There once

461
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:14,569
was a snake that did not care. And then the reader that has no idea. Right. Reader has no clue what

462
01:34:14,569 --> 01:34:19,050
the fuck you're talking about. What do you mean that once was a snake that did not care.

463
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:40,310
This I see kids playing. There's a house over here too. So we've got the house and there once

464
01:34:40,949 --> 01:34:50,229
I don't see a snake here sir. Right. That's not a factory. That is a house. It's that's a chimney.

465
01:34:55,590 --> 01:35:03,880
What are you linking me here. This that's pretty good. But I didn't get that far yet.

466
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,920
But that was exactly I didn't get that far. But you got you getting the right idea.

467
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:17,029
No this is a chimney. It's cold. Look they're wearing jackets. All right. That's the ball

468
01:35:17,029 --> 01:35:21,109
playing ball. There once was a snake that did not care. But we make sure we had the clouds are very

469
01:35:21,109 --> 01:35:29,750
prominent in this shot. They are like wow it's pretty pretty. God fuck. It's all right.

470
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:37,579
They're huge. So this is the first page. And then maybe like a couple of birds.

471
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:47,140
And then maybe for the people with the keen eyes. What color is a snake. This is very important.

472
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:55,289
Green. Blue. Pink. Red. Blue. Like you could like a little like right there. Like a little

473
01:35:55,289 --> 01:36:06,680
face. Little snake face with tongue coming out. Just like oh I see him. Right. Kids love that shit.

474
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:15,609
Kids love to be like there once was a snake. Where's this. I found him. Right. The sky is blue.

475
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:23,060
Then the snake can be. But is there but is there any copywritten green snakes.

476
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:38,340
Is that make sure there's no copywritten green snakes. Are there. None. There are a lot. It's

477
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:44,329
a green snake. Snakes are green. Yeah but I don't know what there's like a copywritten fucking snake.

478
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:54,279
All right. Well we need to maybe like a green. There once was a snake that didn't care.

479
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:01,670
There's a little face popping just barely over that cloud. So they could point it out and be

480
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:07,510
like wait is what is that. And then we're gonna medium zoom. Next page. Save this one. There once

481
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:13,220
was a snake that did not care. All right. I'm gonna save this. Let's just open up another one.

482
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:25,369
Open. How do I quickly just open a new paint. The next page is just this image.

483
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:32,710
Yeah you guys are getting it. You are. The gray makes this very depressing.

484
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:43,159
Now the grays do not hurt your eyes. What's the what's the fucking. Do I need to open like

485
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:50,489
another one of these. Can I just do new. Well let's delete this one. It's control n right.

486
01:37:51,210 --> 01:38:10,229
Can I do tabs. Save as png. I'm gonna title this page one. Okay. And then just control n.

487
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:15,449
Control n. That works. Look I told you it's gonna hurt your eyes. That's why I want to block this

488
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:28,500
shit out. Because look. Nope. Right there. Like I just blew everybody's eyes out. So then we got

489
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:34,260
the the next one is there once was a snake that did not care. Got up on a cloud. How'd he get there.

490
01:38:36,539 --> 01:38:49,130
Got up on a cloud. How'd he get there. 50 dollars just came in. From some guy. Thanks for 50 bucks.

491
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:55,699
Okay so I've got the greatest idea. Let's say the snake got up on the cloud because he didn't care.

492
01:38:55,779 --> 01:39:01,300
Right. That's how he got there. But he got removed far from his friends. He's lonely. He wants to get

493
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:06,100
back down and through a process of learning how to care again he gets back off the pedestal he

494
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:29,189
created for himself. That's too deep for kids. I was gonna have him like fucking ride up on a

495
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:50,630
rainbow because like he don't underestimate kids. Well he could still get up there because he wanted

496
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:56,500
to get away. He didn't care and he he got removed from his friends and maybe there's a bunch of

497
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:13,460
snakes. This is gonna be groundbreaking book. But how did you get up there? Rainbow is the serpent.

498
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:23,579
Rainbow snake already exists. Well it doesn't matter. Okay well that's a great fucking idea.

499
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:27,180
I'm gonna hold on to that for a second while we make panel two. So this is panel two. We gotta

500
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:38,819
get first two panels. Uh the once was snake that did not care. Got up on a cloud. How. Remember

501
01:40:38,819 --> 01:40:51,739
it's gonna be simple english. Like how did he get there. But we only got you look all these kids

502
01:40:51,739 --> 01:41:08,579
books are not even one sentence per page. How are we gonna get like a struggle in here. The cloud is

503
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:26,300
from the it's not a factory. It's not a factory. Okay so again here we go page two. We are we are

504
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:38,039
now up here. Put some more back here for for distance and depth and that way there and then

505
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:45,000
here he is looking down. You know he's like staring down like that. I don't know how to

506
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:57,260
do that in uh pretend painting. Like he's looking down like that. So he's like looking down.

507
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:19,350
He's on the cloud here. Okay that like you gotta get it right you know.

508
01:42:20,069 --> 01:42:49,770
Okay okay okay okay okay okay. Now we gotta get his mouth. All snakes have the fun tongue right.

509
01:42:50,729 --> 01:42:56,500
But this is down. He's looking down and he could even have the factory over here. You know what

510
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:08,649
I mean. Like we need perspective down. Like maybe you could have like some other shit that's over

511
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:15,289
here. Maybe like some other like buildings or something. Like he he is looking the perspective

512
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:28,569
is that way. No like this. Like I'm looking at you right now. Like all right so let's get uh I mean

513
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:34,569
I can't really. You understand what I'm going for here. Okay got up on a cloud. How did he get

514
01:43:34,569 --> 01:43:48,729
there? That's page two. Just say bird's eye view. It was a snake. So it wouldn't be it would be a

515
01:43:48,729 --> 01:43:56,380
snake's eye view. Wouldn't be a bird's eye. Okay page two is done. I don't want to blow your eyes

516
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:18,140
out when I do this. So I'm gonna go like this. Save this one. Page two. Okay let's come back.

517
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:31,819
There we go. So page three. Here we go. Once was a snake that didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.

518
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:47,079
How'd he get there? Where we're used to the rain. Droplets of water. Don't fall up there. Watch the

519
01:44:47,079 --> 01:45:03,659
teeter totter. Um should a storm come in and like fucking lightning and stuff. And that's what he

520
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:28,149
like maybe he falls off and goes like down the chimney. How'd it get up there? No that was a

521
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:48,229
fun book. Um see you later. No uh the chimney he climbed one day. To his friends. Wait goodbye.

522
01:45:48,789 --> 01:46:30,149
I'll see you another day. The why could I turn to seagulls doing math? There once was a snake that

523
01:46:30,149 --> 01:46:40,170
didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow. How'd he get there? His friends and family he did say goodbye.

524
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:56,170
Friends and family he did say goodbye. Reaching higher he wanted to try. It's about reaching too

525
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:02,170
high. It's about trying too hard and not setting correct goals for yourself that you get in over

526
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:18,140
your head and you get to a point where you can't come down. What did I just say clip that? I don't

527
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:39,670
even know what I just said clip it. It was genius though. Whatever it was. It's about reaching too

528
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:44,949
high. It's about reaching too high. It's about trying too hard and not setting correct goals

529
01:47:44,949 --> 01:47:49,430
for yourself that you get in over your head and you get to a point where you can't come down.

530
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:52,310
Okay what what what what was the shitty rhyme that I did?

531
01:47:53,430 --> 01:48:13,399
No that's no but you don't know. It's about reaching too high. No but what was the actual

532
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:25,909
line? It was he's okay but how did he get there? To his friends and family he did say goodbye.

533
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:45,319
It's about setting realistic goals and this could be like a flashback of him like with a

534
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:55,619
fucking hat on right like getting on a train like waving and like getting on a train yep.

535
01:48:55,619 --> 01:49:09,380
This is going to be an elaborate one here okay so we've got the train to his friends family he

536
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:14,220
did say this is like if there's a flashback there's going to be look right watch this

537
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:21,720
so in this panel there's going to be like there'll be some like mist around the edges so like

538
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:26,840
children can understand that this is like this happened before right so there's like mist here

539
01:49:28,699 --> 01:49:44,359
how it's cloudy kind of mist and make it cloudy you know what I'm saying let's just get the train

540
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:49,079
out so this i'm thinking i'm thinking like this way right i'm thinking like dye like this

541
01:49:49,960 --> 01:50:07,609
like this is the train and here's like the like the bottom part of the train i gotta get like

542
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:23,659
look it's hard to do this there's like the tracks it's it's a fucking dream sequence all right lay

543
01:50:23,739 --> 01:50:37,060
off you get the idea though like yeah like that is the snake his snake friends are here here they

544
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:48,310
are and he's gonna be like out of hanging out of a window with a fucking hat on like it like it

01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:28,819
out the window he's traveling he's away he's leaving he's traveling he's going to he's going

547
01:51:28,819 --> 01:51:42,409
to do something he's going to where's he going and it could be like other people like walking

with the way that these are the way that they look they could be factories but it's like so

611
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:23,479
muddled in his brain this could be factories they're like shaped like factories could be

612
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:35,449
pollution i don't know writing fucking books is hard okay especially when you write them in like

646
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:05,930
45 minutes to an hour that's some pretty good like time versus investment you know what i mean

647
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:12,899
that like really some people write a book for fucking four years and i'll prove it to you

699
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:32,629
cloud disappears and he fall he slowly falls because yeah i don't know something like that

700
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:44,469
if he like lands in something like that but that's a good that's a good start so he cries a tear

701
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:51,979
one tear oh like i you know i miss my i miss everybody like i wish i could just let's go back

702
02:24:51,979 --> 02:24:57,799
i want to go back home and visit everybody and it's like you can you just you can and then like you

703
02:24:57,799 --> 02:25:05,430
know it rains and then bingo right here clouds start dissipating a little bit and like yeah then

704
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:10,620
the sun comes up over here you know i'm saying the sun is over here we're going but we're in the end

705
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:23,530
game here so clouds dissipating and then like the bit that maybe the gold bridge back here can like

706
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:28,489
you know okay whatever it's like gone it's like starting to fall apart starting to like wither away

707
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:36,709
and uh and this whole time remember he's like maybe he'll like think about like that we already

708
02:25:36,709 --> 02:25:47,639

709
02:25:47,639 --> 02:26:15,030
friends help him here how like his friends are in this panel somehow as flashbacks around him and

710
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:23,370
they slowly let him fall but we just didn't kids don't understand the sun

711
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:46,299
he sees his friends as forest ghosts maybe people look up because they think it's raining

712
02:26:47,670 --> 02:27:09,860
and then they i don't know this is close this is just a draw my life it's not even a book

713
02:27:10,659 --> 02:27:27,030

822
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:22,260
they're all great but this one's cute too it's raining

823
02:57:35,719 --> 02:57:44,040

824
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:53,370
artistic like drawing and like cartoon kind of skills right but if you did and you made a little

825

cute snake comic kind of cartoon you can make a book you can do it i know you can here's another

826
02:58:01,879 --> 02:58:09,209
one i thought this one was really good i'm not sure who this one's not credited but just still

827
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:22,760
equally as good i think i like i like the line work on this one it's just it's nice looks pretty

830
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:51,350

831
02:58:51,350 --> 02:58:57,510

i want just to hang out and have like a little chill stream play eye spy and then rant about

855
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:43,700
a children's book we'll be up to five hours we'll go for about five or six hours okay that's all

856
03:03:43,700 --> 03:03:51,020
right i'm okay with that so here's the plan uh there are a few things that i want to do

857
03:03:51,020 --> 03:04:01,639
the vibe is incoming shout out to the one guy that said you couldn't do it and i mean we there

858
03:04:01,639 --> 03:04:06,920
was probably like 5400 people 5300 people there i dropped a thousand viewers writing and doing

859
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:20,649
that stupid stream it's okay uh look it don't matter you were number one trending on twitch

860
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:27,059
no it doesn't matter look as long as i'm having a good time and you guys are having a good time

861
03:04:27,059 --> 03:04:32,090
it's fine it's that don't matter i had a lot of fun this is a fucking fun stream

862
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:41,750
i spy was fun children's book was fun you guys are fucking awesome you guys are you guys are so

863
03:04:41,750 --> 03:04:46,950
talented and amazing all the artwork thanks for uh putting up with the bullshit here at the uh at

864
03:04:46,950 --> 03:04:54,010
the when i gave up on the book but it's okay i've given up on a book before way before getting to

865
03:04:54,010 --> 03:05:09,459
the end and we are gonna get to the bits but i'll see you guys uh probably tuesday i'm probably

866
03:05:09,459 --> 03:05:18,709
here's what's gonna happen i'm gonna do a shitload of five because i am way backlogged with vibe so

867
03:05:18,709 --> 03:05:25,260
nothing tomorrow and we're probably gonna go tuesday wednesday thursday with vibe just straight up

868
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:37,260
vibe i want to do mine show i want to do some of the vibe exclusive vr things that i missed a lot

869
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:50,069
of people thought were fun late to the party pretty much a five week coming up here but the

870
03:05:50,069 --> 03:05:53,670
reason why i'm gonna do three days in a row with five is because those streams are not going to be

871
03:05:53,670 --> 03:05:59,739
very long those of you that know that you saw me play other games with the psvr i could get this

872
03:05:59,739 --> 03:06:05,979
image off the fucking screen too by the way i can really only go in that thing for like four hours

873
03:06:07,620 --> 03:06:19,350
so we'll just do three days in a row right with like three to five hour streams can i even get

874
03:06:19,350 --> 03:06:30,260
this off the screen it's like kind of stuck here forever keep it for the stream over but yeah we'll

875
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:37,049
do a few days in a row five shorten the streams up a little bit but go more days so thanks for

876
03:06:37,049 --> 03:06:41,770
coming thanks for watching a little bit shorter today but uh i did the things that i thought i

877
03:06:41,770 --> 03:06:53,670
would that would be fun to do that's the thumbnail for the stream oh god yeah and also i was talking

878
03:06:53,670 --> 03:07:02,600
to uh i was talking to kiwo and she was talking about maybe doing vr chat because i don't know

879
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:07,959
anything about it and she knows that whole world so we may do a stream where we just do vr chat and

880
03:07:07,959 --> 03:07:24,219
fuck around you know we talked about it don't do that heavy supervision don't worry i'm gonna be

uh thank you tar all a crin for the one dollar do you remember earlier this week when i donated

921
03:13:24,010 --> 03:13:27,930
money to ask when you were going to play shen mu and you said you would start on thursday i remember

922
03:13:27,930 --> 03:13:37,829
rich streamer lies to his fans no no no no what happened was here's what happened i got addicted

923
03:13:38,389 --> 03:13:46,309
i got addicted to crazy taxi and space channel to a point where i bought space channel part one

924
03:13:46,870 --> 03:13:53,500
and i'm gonna play that so i got addicted to other dreamcast games before opening shin mu

925
03:13:54,729 --> 03:13:59,690
so what's gonna happen which i own one and two shin mu is gonna have to turn into one of those

926
03:13:59,690 --> 03:14:05,819
streams where it's just i'm just gonna relax and i'm gonna play it because it doesn't it didn't

927
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:11,739
fit in with like the dreamcast streams because it's a long game that requires a lot of attention

928
03:14:11,739 --> 03:14:17,260
and a lot of time so i couldn't really just open up shin mu for 40 minutes all right that was funny

929
03:14:17,260 --> 03:14:32,090
hello well no you gotta get that game attention in time so that's why they haven't seen shin mu

930
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:35,290
yet that's why and also ace attorney a lot of people have been talking about ace attorney

931
03:14:36,420 --> 03:14:41,780
and i know i said i was gonna play ace attorney but then i was told that there's a better version

932
03:14:41,780 --> 03:14:47,860
that's gonna come out that's being remastered in hd and the ipad version sucks and it's buggy and

933
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:52,969
broken and terrible and then i'm like ah i was gonna play it on the ipad and then get a ds but

934
03:14:52,969 --> 03:15:04,709
i'm emulating a ds is i'd rather just own it and do it legally change oh i gotta change category

935
03:15:04,709 --> 03:15:13,780
you're right because that is true we're just kind of sitting here change the category i'm no longer

936
03:15:13,780 --> 03:15:33,979
streaming art you are correct on that for sure uh just irl uh chatting right okay there we go

937
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:38,059
yeah i don't want to just be in a category i'm not supposed to be in well other people are

938
03:15:38,059 --> 03:15:44,200
actually doing art and stuff on stream so you can play ace attorney on apple yeah but that's what

939
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:50,440
i'm saying uh the ipad version i've been told by many people is not the version that i want to play

940
03:15:51,239 --> 03:16:00,360
it's apparently not very good it's not as clean as the ds version kind of sloppy from what i've

941
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:10,680
heard it is something i'm going to do eventually when the pc version comes out the pc version has

942
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:19,659
a random release date of 2019 yeah it is just going to come out one day but i'll be ready uh

943
03:16:19,659 --> 03:16:25,770
flug boy flug boy gave 22 dollars earlier thank you flug boy for your 22 bucks hope you're doing

944
03:16:25,770 --> 03:16:30,809
well germa after the space channel 5 stream it got me really into the series and i do love it

jerma you're very welcome flank tank thanks for three bucks oh man the nostalgia on this stream

960
03:18:34,010 --> 03:18:39,450
is real i used to play these games these i spy games in my elementary typing class in the fourth

961
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:45,530
and fifth grade the teacher let anyone over 75 words per minute goof off and i had the highest

962
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:54,010
in my class at 95 yeah at some point the teacher is probably just you know what you're doing at

963
03:18:54,010 --> 03:19:04,379
that point you probably had to pass with like 30 or 40 words per minute that's a lot for being

964
03:19:04,379 --> 03:19:13,829
that young though you could go on to be like a court stenographer going that fast but yeah i

965
03:19:13,829 --> 03:19:21,989
never played the i spy games i did not play it it was cute it was cute it was endearing

966
03:19:22,790 --> 03:19:29,319
i could see what people have such fond memories of it i can a stenographer needs 200 plus words

967
03:19:29,319 --> 03:19:37,479
per minute how do you not run into sentences on each other if you can do 200 words a minute

968
03:19:38,780 --> 03:19:42,780
at some point you the words that are coming before the words you just typed are already

969
03:19:42,780 --> 03:19:50,709
happening in your brain and on the screen it's just too that's too fast i don't know how that's

970
03:19:50,709 --> 03:19:57,500
possible uh hey rtm thanks for the three bucks i remember when i was a little lad i would read

971
03:19:57,500 --> 03:20:02,540
the look alike books which were kind of like i spy but instead of having things to look for

972
03:20:02,540 --> 03:20:07,180
they would just present an image of day-to-day life recreated with common items like for a movie

973
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:11,899
theater scene the ticket booth would be made out of film canisters and the bright stage lights

974
03:20:11,899 --> 03:20:17,180
would be popcorn i haven't thought about those since school so thanks for unearthing a pleasant

975
03:20:17,180 --> 03:20:29,129
childhood memory absolutely i never played them but they sound interesting 3d movie maker was my

976
03:20:30,379 --> 03:20:39,079
childhood game that i played on the computer that was like 1994 1995 so i was like how old was i

977
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:50,790
uh like 13 12 something like that yeah thank you rtm for the three bucks thank you creation

978
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:59,579
the cyborg for the one dollar i've ever heard about the atari vcs no atari is one of those

979
03:20:59,579 --> 03:21:04,700
systems that i i love reminiscing on how it's like the stepping stone for all video games

980
03:21:04,700 --> 03:21:09,100
but i also don't think i'd ever want to go back and play atari because it's actually like two

981
03:21:09,100 --> 03:21:14,299
tetris blocks on the screen moving back and forth in a ball going somewhere between them

982
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:25,159
it's not they're not like oh yeah i can't wait to go back and play tanks not really but i do

983
03:21:25,159 --> 03:21:30,360
respect the fact that it was the stepping stone for pretty much everything so you have to respect

984
03:21:30,360 --> 03:21:40,440
that the pitfall is at least is interesting enough but a lot of the atari library is very very

985
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:49,459
simple stuff the 2600 can be fun no i know it can be but i'm not sure that's something i would

986
03:21:49,459 --> 03:21:58,709
want to go back and go get and oh i'm gonna spend like a grand on atari 2600 stuff not necessarily

987
03:21:58,709 --> 03:22:09,100
i'll watch a documentary about it and say that was awesome thank you damona cucumber for the

999
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:34,920

so hard it woke my dog up and that was a lot of fun there's a lot of fun my favorite part was

1079
03:34:27,299 --> 03:34:31,620
getting really amped up and doing four pages or five pages and been starting to get like a

1080
03:34:31,620 --> 03:34:36,420
coherent story and then clearly even seeing that the characters are not even colored in

1081
03:34:37,219 --> 03:34:44,500
at page six seven eight and nine it was just like it was like not only was it getting to a point

1082

03:57:34,100 --> 03:57:37,379
uh why do you think there's such a large presence of them who are attracted to your channel

1236
03:57:37,379 --> 03:57:41,379
specifically it's something that you or your community offers that others don't something

1237
03:57:41,379 --> 03:57:51,530
that would explain the abundance of them thinking i don't know well are these is this the are these

1289
04:06:57,350 --> 04:07:01,590
uh snooze and coffee thanks for the one dollar still thinking about making those trading cards

1290
04:07:01,670 --> 04:07:08,219
now that you have the store i remembered it don't think you i forget it uh i've talked about the

1291
04:07:08,219 --> 04:07:12,219
trading cards a couple times the thing about the trading cards thing that i want to do here's if

1292
04:07:12,219 --> 04:07:16,379
you're not curious the thing like an idea that i have that i thought would be fun is to make

1293
04:07:17,579 --> 04:07:24,059
collectible cards and physical packs uh not a card not a game but just kind of a collectible

1294
04:07:24,059 --> 04:07:31,659
physical tangible thing to hold on to for fun and have different you know oh like i open you open

1295
04:07:31,659 --> 04:07:35,260
up like a pack and there's art on the pack and it's nice and they're made well and they're you

1296
04:07:35,260 --> 04:07:40,780
know distributed and there's like a bunch of different commons and like really like an epic

1297
04:07:40,780 --> 04:07:44,540
card in each one it wouldn't be very expensive would just be for fun just to have for the

1298
04:07:44,540 --> 04:07:52,579
community and what i ran into with i know a guy that knows like that industry about like selling

1299
04:07:52,579 --> 04:07:58,100
and wholesaling and uh did a lot of research for me and how much things are going to cost

1300
04:07:58,100 --> 04:08:01,909
and the whole thing was going to cost like tens of thousands of dollars it's going to be like

1301
04:08:01,909 --> 04:08:07,049
probably thirty to fifty thousand dollars for the whole thing so i was like uh i'm probably

1302
04:08:07,049 --> 04:08:14,229
gonna have to hold off on that because it was gonna cost a lot of money just even the card

1303
04:08:14,229 --> 04:08:25,770
packaging and card packs themselves is it like a lot of production cost just to get them made so

1304
04:08:26,649 --> 04:08:33,000
not now but i always told myself so for instance if it was let's say i could like kind of if i could

1305
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:38,200
like swim by because obviously it's the production cost which was a lot of money just to get it in

1306
04:08:38,200 --> 04:08:45,420
the first place and we're talking remember we're talking if you sell a card pack and there is think

1307
04:08:45,420 --> 04:08:49,819
about this how just just physical how many of these things would have to be made because if

1308
04:08:49,819 --> 04:08:57,690
they were like five to ten cards in each like card pack i would need to produce potentially

1309
04:08:57,690 --> 04:09:03,719
thousands of cards right even if they were only like 50 to 100 pieces of artwork they would need

1310
04:09:03,719 --> 04:09:12,040
to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cards made it's a lot of cards so my theory was if i

1311
04:09:12,040 --> 04:09:16,520
ever get like to a position where i had a lot of extra kind of income or a lot of money that i had

1312
04:09:16,520 --> 04:09:21,670
that i was ready to go it would be sort of a decision i'd have to make because as long as i

1313
04:09:21,670 --> 04:09:27,000
could like break even that i was it was something i wanted to do and maybe the production cost

1314
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:32,069
paying i was gonna have a bunch of artists potentially but as of right now it's not like

1315
04:09:32,069 --> 04:09:44,459
on the table not now so that's kind of the long and short of the whole thing so uh and i what

1316
04:09:44,459 --> 04:09:49,420
i've told myself recently is coming up with ideas and things that i'd like to do are great

1317
04:09:49,420 --> 04:09:57,180
but i really need to focus on things that i can do now not things that i want to do later things

1318
04:09:57,180 --> 04:10:10,010
i can do now and that's something that i can't do now hope you understand green screen green

1319
04:10:10,010 --> 04:10:14,979
screen card is just a green card yeah it's gonna be like a bunch of characters a bunch of original

1320
04:10:14,979 --> 04:10:23,110
like rumble characters and no like copy written characters but there's plenty of original stuff

1321
04:10:23,110 --> 04:10:31,370
to make into like a little card thing at least i think but we'll have to wait maybe but thank you

1322
04:10:31,370 --> 04:10:38,379
snoozing copter uh thank you though for the one two dollars you oh i accidentally press enter now

1323
04:10:38,379 --> 04:10:41,819
see what you made me do i messed up and i forgot what i was saying oh yeah apparently you didn't

1324
04:10:41,819 --> 04:10:46,659
promise my me my lawyer just told me but whatever if you still want to do it you know where you can

1325
04:10:46,659 --> 04:10:53,000
find me yeah and that's i've wanted to make like a game to all these things of stuff that's gonna

1326
04:10:53,000 --> 04:11:00,090
have because it's got to be by the fucking book because i'm not gonna do like a kickstarter or

1327
04:11:00,090 --> 04:11:05,799
do like oh i'm gonna throw up like fucking 30 grand unless like it is certain that it's

1328
04:11:05,799 --> 04:11:10,520
going to be completely by the book people are going to get paid like this amount and this is

1329
04:11:10,520 --> 04:11:15,479
what's going to happen this is who's going to be involved it's a it's very messy and i don't want

1330
04:11:15,479 --> 04:11:21,399
to cause like a mess in this community so i'm going to have to be very very careful with stuff

1331
04:11:21,399 --> 04:11:33,190
like that because then you kind of get into the weeds of are there too many people that are on

1332
04:11:33,190 --> 04:11:38,709
the project are there do you have enough money to pay everybody make sure that first before it's

1333
04:11:38,709 --> 04:11:54,899
like oh yeah you you you you you you you and you it's got to be done right and i obviously

1334
04:11:54,899 --> 04:12:00,739
want to have a significant amount of money to pay people because people are going to be making

1335
04:12:00,739 --> 04:12:09,899
potentially at least a handful of pieces each so it's got to be done right i can't just do it

1336
04:12:09,899 --> 04:12:14,969
just there let's go tomorrow i guess i'm gonna write like some stuff down no it's gonna be done

1337
04:12:14,969 --> 04:12:21,579

the entire video game medium it was like two years where no new video games are created

1368
04:16:17,370 --> 04:16:21,690

1405
04:22:32,709 --> 04:22:39,690
good intentions is it a placeholder yeah i don't i don't know on a website i don't really have a

04:22:39,690 --> 04:22:48,569
need for it i don't really have a need for it you know what i mean but thank you to all the new subs

1407
04:22:48,569 --> 04:22:53,639
on all the old ones that sounds like a fire i'm afraid to click on that is that like a virus

1408
04:22:53,639 --> 04:23:05,719
website i'm afraid to touch it but yeah i mean i do i do like look if somebody grabbed like a

1409
04:23:05,719 --> 04:23:12,440
germa985.com and they just kind of have it and they're just like keeping it kind of under a

1410
04:23:12,440 --> 04:23:15,639
lock and key and if they you know if i ever asked him for it and they would give it to me i mean

1411
04:23:15,639 --> 04:23:21,000
that's that's all right i'm not like oh how dare they because i didn't do it and i didn't think

1412
04:23:21,000 --> 04:23:30,280
about it but i don't think i really need um i don't think i really need a website because that's more

1413
04:23:30,280 --> 04:23:34,440
from me to think about and do remember it took me a long time to come around to the idea of having a

1414
04:23:34,440 --> 04:23:39,659
discord and even that is like another thing and then i'm gonna run a website i'm gonna have a

to happen that i maybe i would look into it just make it link to the store yeah i would need to

1418
04:24:06,579 --> 04:24:11,700
