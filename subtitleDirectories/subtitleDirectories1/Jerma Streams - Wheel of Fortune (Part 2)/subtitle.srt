1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,029
No, I almost just turned off the power supply to the computer.

2
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:16,679
What is happening today? It would have just been like GOOOOO and the stream would have turned off.

3
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:28,780
Okay, I should be good to go here in a sec. At least I hope so.

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:36,250
And, come on. Hey, there we go. Perfect.

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:51,079
I gotta plug in my shit. I should be able to see it in a second here.

6
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:59,780
What did I do with this computer? Okay. Should I play online? I mean, I guess I'm gonna.

7
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:08,680
Like, a thousand of you guys bought the game. Like, legit a thousand of you guys

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,680
probably bought this game and when I played it for like fifteen minutes you're probably like, what the fuck, dude?

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:23,939
Alright, one more sec. I gotta plug this in.

10
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,359
Wheel of Fortune. Can we get the mods to change it?

11
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:54,040
Hey. What's going on with the... What did I do to my thing here?

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:13,800
What did I just do? Where's my webcam?

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,379
Can you guys see? Is my webcam here? Can you guys see?

14
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,860
My OBS is crashed. I literally can't see anything over here.

15
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:46,629
Like, full on crashed. Wait, there we go. Alright, I fixed it.

16
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:53,419
Wheel of Fortune. Let's do it. I do have to change my microphone shit here.

17
00:02:53,419 --> 00:03:02,250
This has been a wild stream. I have to

18
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,250
stop saying that I'm gonna chill and have like a chill day. Every time I say I wanna have a

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,250
chill out day, just weird shit happens. Every time. I just

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,250
go fucking crazy. I'm not linking to the club. Get out of here.

21
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:38,310
There we go. Okay. Put it in emote only. Go for it. I'm going in

22
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,310
online. I'm not gonna tell you when I'm gonna go because I don't want anyone to... I don't want anyone to know

23
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,740
where I'm going. I apologize to the three thousand people that left over the course of the

24
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,740
last four hours. Considering that it was probably one of the best

25
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,620
ones I've done this year. No, you know what? Fuck that. I actually had a lot of fun today. So I don't

26
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,629
even care. I don't even care. I like had a blast today. This is like a lot of fun. I don't even care.

27
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:07,210
Alright. I'm not gonna tell you when I'm gonna click it.

28
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:26,810
For the stream sniper Andes out there. What the fuck am I doing?

29
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,560
What's wrong with me? What? I muted the game,

30
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,560
dude. I need to eat a fucking bag of peanuts or something.

31
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,860
I swear to God. I muted the game

32
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,860
and thought that was... Oh my. Okay. Honest to God.

33
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,189
Holy shit, dude. You've got to be kidding me.

34
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:55,079
I'm just not with it today. What? I'm shocked

35
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,750
right now. Honestly, I need to eat like a fucking steak.

36
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,750
Oh my God, dude.

37
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Fucking Bjork.

38
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Jesus.

39
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:35,019
Alright, let's go. Food and drink.

40
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:39,189
Food and drink. Steamed. Steamed vegetables.

41
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,189
Steamed vegetables. I got it. I'm sorry. That was loud.

42
00:05:43,189 --> 00:06:05,079
It's vege-tables, right? Is it vege-tables or vege-tables?

43
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:17,689
Let's go.

44
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:31,209
Coffee. Something. Donut. Donut's coffee.

45
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,720
Donut. What?

46
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,519
I don't know brands were in this. That's a brand. That's not...

47
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,189
Okay. Brands are in this, apparently.

48
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:28,250
What?

49
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:41,379
Oh, wouldn't it be funny if you hit Bankrupt? That would've been amazing.

50
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:52,540
A place.

51
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,420
This is a place. France Street.

52
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,819
Trees. Tree stumps.

53
00:08:41,509 --> 00:09:05,820
Ooh, it's a wild, too.

54
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,419
What? Why did I...

55
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:20,809
What? The clock ticker. I had five seconds?

56
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:26,710
Why did I have ten seconds? Listen, motherfucker, it's

57
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,340
train station, okay? Just win. What happened? I was like,

58
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:42,659
oh, I got a second to make sure there's... It's train station. Somebody win it.

59
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:49,129
I'm so loud, computer. I don't know what...

60
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,820
I did not expect it to be like five seconds. I'm sitting there going, yeah, train station.

61
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,820
I was like, okay. And I was like, oh, I can't... It's all vowels.

62
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,820
So, I'm sitting here looking, and I'm like, wait, okay,

63
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
I have to buy the vowels. It was only vowels left. And I'm just like,

64
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,820
I can't find them, because I was trying to make some extra money.

65
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,620
What the fuck?

66
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,570
That sucked. It was only vowels left.

67
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,570
I didn't want to solve it immediately, because I... Whatever.

68
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:40,889
Hey, by the way, viewers going up.

69
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:48,759
They're coming back. They're coming back.

70
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,179
There's a phrase? Okay. Phrase. Stop.

71
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:42,230
Stop.

72
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:58,009
Draw. No.

73
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:06,090
Stop. Stop out of...

74
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:21,899
Stop out for...

75
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,350
Stop. Put. It. Stop. Put it.

76
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:37,269
It's my fucking turn. I mean, it's gonna stop, right?

77
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:48,019
Okay. Okay, there's O. I'm gonna say

78
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:54,120
M somewhere?

79
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,320
I've never seen that be anything but bankrupt.

80
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:09,700
It's only been bankrupt.

81
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:23,460
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

82
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:38,250
I think this might be... I think I know what one of these words is.

83
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:53,990
Comfort? Stop by.

84
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:01,110
I don't know.

85
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,039
Comfort. Time.

86
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,039
Comfort.

87
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,240
Stop out of something comfort.

88
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,980
What is this? This makes no sense.

89
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:49,580
Stop out.

90
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:11,289
All I know is you guys saying his brain, dot, dot, dot, his brain.

91
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:18,379
Okay, this is a thing. Any S's?

92
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,620
That 10 second timer is bullshit. It needs to be like 15.

93
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,649
Okay.

94
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:40,419
Don't lose a turn. Come on.

95
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:45,240
Okay.

96
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Any H's?

97
00:15:49,240 --> 00:16:03,460
I see an Among Us character banned that person for

98
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:18,120
one minute. Can you do it?

99
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:47,269
Something TS.

100
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,269
All right. All right.

101
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,700
Second place. And the million dollars is gone.

102
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:10,150
This could work out.

103
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,980
Considence? A thing.

104
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,859
I don't know. I have no idea what it is.

105
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:36,329
Express 1000. All right, nice. Wait, that means I have to solve it.

106
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:44,259
This timer.

107
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:50,039
I fucking hate this timer.

108
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:59,720
That wouldn't make any sense, dude. This timer is shorter than

109
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:12,920
it was last time.

110
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,950
Dude, three seconds to choose a letter. See, it's fucking up everybody.

111
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:29,130
Not just me. All right, land on bankrupt.

112
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:38,710
Okay. Peanuts.

113
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:53,099
Peanuts. Tree nuts.

114
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:09,769
What is this?

115
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:27,430
I don't have time to look.

116
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,480
What would be the first?

117
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,980
All the N's are freaking me out.

118
00:19:52,220 --> 00:20:14,279
They don't know it either.

119
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:28,339
Nuggets? I know what it is.

120
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:36,069
Magnets. Where's M?

121
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,069
Where's M? It's not magnets?

122
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:44,069
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. I got time.

123
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:52,390
I got time. I got time. Ban. Oh fuck.

124
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,700
Oh.

125
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,200
Nuts. It's gotta be like nuts.

126
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:13,079
Bang nuts?

127
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,450
I have no idea. I thought it was...

128
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:25,829
I don't care. I'm gonna be the funny guy.

129
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:42,490
Are you solving it? What is it?

130
00:21:42,490 --> 00:22:05,579
What possibly could this be?

131
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:20,230
Nuts? I was gonna say that's a word.

132
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,230
He doesn't know it either.

133
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:32,299
I think I know what it is.

134
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:37,619
Yeah. What is going on?

135
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:52,039
Do we really not know what none of us do?

136
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,980
King nuts. All right, that was a warm up.

137
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:05,190
That was a warm up.

138
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:16,019
Can I get banned from the game? Because I wrote bang nuts.

139
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:23,720
Catcher. I mean, I'm just gonna fucking guess.

140
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,160
One. There's one letter left.

141
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,500
Yadimir?

142
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:53,910
Is it Yadimir? Is it two R's?

143
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,910
It might just be two R's. It's either two R's or

144
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,859
it's Yadimir. No way. It's not Yadimir.

145
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,289
There's no way. There's no way. It's definitely. It's two R's.

146
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:12,099
Is it Yadimir? Or just two R's, right? I don't know.

147
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:18,250
It's not fucking Yadimir.

148
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,250
There's one letter left. I didn't know it was gonna be that.

149
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,220
This is a warm up round, guys.

150
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:43,210
Warm up, warm up, warm up.

151
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,660
Goat cheese.

152
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,220
No.

153
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,410
Grier.

154
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:36,730
What?

155
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,809
Okay, food and drink.

156
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:57,539
Really?

157
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,619
Fried. Sauteed.

158
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:13,980
You don't actually know it, do you?

159
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:45,059
Battered.

160
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:50,329
That's not what it is, man.

161
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:55,269
Well, I mean, now I know it's battered.

162
00:26:55,269 --> 00:27:00,220
Battered fish. Battered eggs.

163
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,220
Stop!

164
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,940
Ooh, wait a minute. Battered.

165
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,900
It's not battered.

166
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:26,619
It's not battered. Slathered? Smothered.

167
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:50,740
Slathered? Saltered?

168
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,980
It's not saltered. I'm sorry that was loud.

169
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:02,940
I don't fucking know.

170
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:13,940
I don't fucking know.

171
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,019
W. Buttered water?

172
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,319
Is it buttered water? Why would you have buttered water?

173
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:27,319
Buttered water?

174
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:38,779
Buttered water? Iced water? Purified water?

175
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:49,079
Spring water? Filtered fucking water?

176
00:28:49,079 --> 00:29:00,730
That guy fucked me up with the battered.

177
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:10,970
Whatever. Oh, wait, they had the bonus round.

178
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:27,140
She's got the bonus round. Let's see what she does.

179
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,319
It's a phrase.

180
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,319
It's a phrase.

181
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:42,059
Engine.

182
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:57,029
I can help you out here. It's enter. Enter? It's enter.

183
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:04,539
Or it might be like...

184
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:12,220
No. What?

185
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,440
Day? Enjoy your day.

186
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,019
That's not a phrase.

187
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:28,019
That's generic language. That's not a phrase.

188
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,460
Enjoy your day. That's me speaking of language to you.

189
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,460
Enjoy your day. That's not a phrase. That's literally me saying...

190
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,819
That's not a phrase. It's literally just language.

191
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:46,599
I just said hi. Is how are you a phrase?

192
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:51,029
No, it's just me asking how you're doing. It's not a phrase.

193
00:30:51,029 --> 00:31:00,490
Okay. That was a warm up.

194
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll tell you when I'm clicking it. Magnets, I know.

195
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:42,710
We've got a level 17 here. This is going to be hard.

196
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,849
Okay.

197
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,849
Okay.

198
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:55,849
Let's go.

199
00:31:55,849 --> 00:32:00,410
I'm not fucking around this time.

200
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:14,549
TV title.

201
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:27,500
Saturday Night Live. I haven't watched Saturday Night Live.

202
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:53,160
Whatever. Give us another one.

203
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:09,049
People. I was going to say new sheriff, but it's a new staff member.

204
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:25,349
Wait, new staff members? Good start.

205
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:29,349
This is a phrase. The and.

206
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:44,069
And the. Whatever. 2500. Come on.

207
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:50,940
I'm going to obviously do T.

208
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,650
I'll try an O.

209
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:02,279
I'm going to buy a vowel.

210
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:06,279
Two.

211
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:16,119
I'll spin it again.

212
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,360
It's going to be a T.

213
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:30,519
It's going to be bankrupt.

214
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,519
One of these is probably four.

215
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:44,579
Really?

216
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,579
I could be a total moron and just try to do the four of and.

217
00:34:48,579 --> 00:35:09,050
Okay.

218
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:20,969
No.

219
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,969
Fuck off.

220
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:42,380
Three letter words.

221
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:50,889
I don't know.

222
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,889
Two. Four. And. The. Out.

223
00:35:54,889 --> 00:36:00,019
Hop.

224
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:07,079
R. It's probably a bunch of A's and E's.

225
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,750
Guaranteed. A's and E's.

226
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,750
I get an A up there. We're in E. Probably be able to solve it immediately.

227
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,340
Let's get an A.

228
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Yep. Okay. Okay.

229
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,639
Something R. Our boat.

230
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:46,280
Our boat. I don't know.

231
00:36:46,280 --> 00:37:03,989
Don't.

232
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:11,300
2500.

233
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,059
Look at you.

234
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:20,059
What?

235
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:24,059
I know it. Yeah. You are what you eat.

236
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:30,469
You are boat of and. Oh my

237
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:34,469
God. How did I make it to 36?

238
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:43,739
How did I make it to 36?

239
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:49,260
A boat and

240
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,260
R of two.

241
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,500
Yeah. Sure.

242
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:12,389
All right. Living thing. Wait.

243
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,019
Wombat. No. It's one word. How about like just

244
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:21,019
the cat. The cat. Or the dog.

245
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:26,659
I'm going to go for it. I'm going to go for it. I think it's probably the cat.

246
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:38,070
The dog. Reading the mod chat. Somebody says dude.

247
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:42,070
There's lead in your water.

248
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:51,780
All right.

249
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:58,519
Bat.

250
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:10,170
What's two words? Right? I don't know why I just thought of

251
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,300
Ruh-roh. That's a phrase from Shaggy.

252
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,019
Zdog. Scooby. Go with bankrupt. I'm still in the game.

253
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:27,860
That's about as painful as bankruptcy gets.

254
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,230
Living thing. But it doesn't have to be an animal, right?

255
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:40,440
It could be a plant. There we go. This will put me ahead big time. Come on.

256
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:48,199
Come on.

257
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:52,199
I could have sworn I was going to be

258
00:39:52,199 --> 00:40:00,280
with an H in there or something.

259
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:12,820
Unfortunately, that's not what we need.

260
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:19,050
Lose darn. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

261
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:28,730
It's going to be something really, really specific that I don't know.

262
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:39,780
That's good.

263
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,179
Dog.

264
00:40:45,179 --> 00:41:01,179
Dog. Big dog.

265
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:06,889
Big dog. Okay.

266
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:17,130
It's something dog. What kind of dog?

267
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,130
I knew it was going to be like the dog. It's not the dog though.

268
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:33,079
35. Come on. I don't know.

269
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,079
I don't know.

270
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:49,320
I don't know. I don't know. I could have bought a vowel but

271
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:56,309
I was like a new dog, right? That's what I was thinking. But

272
00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:10,019
I'm sorry. There are none on the board.

273
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:18,920
My dog. Man dog.

274
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:28,389
This is not a living thing.

275
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:32,630
This is not a living thing. Not a living thing.

276
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:38,900
That's not a living thing. I'm sorry.

277
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:54,440
Part of it is. Half of it is.

278
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,130
Laugh dog.

279
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,130
I'm thinking of a certain dog breed or I don't know.

280
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,130
Laugh dog. Living thing.

281
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,130
I'm still in it.

282
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:31,269
Big dog.

283
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,269
F***ing lead in the water. There's lead in the water.

284
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:39,699
There's something in your water.

285
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:51,659
Nobody else got it either.

286
00:43:51,659 --> 00:44:01,719
This is

287
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,719
my eyes are freaking out. Something in the kitchen.

288
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,869
In the kitchen.

289
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:37,400
Lasagna.

290
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,400
That was a big one. That was a huge one. Alright. In the kitchen.

291
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:54,840
Alright. Hold on.

292
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,739
I know. I think I know some of this. Let's find out.

293
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,739
Million. Give me the million.

294
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:12,980
I got it.

295
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:25,289
It's not dishes.

296
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:30,789
How is that word not?

297
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:35,030
D-I-S-H-E. Oh. That would be dishes.

298
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:47,460
Wow. Not a single one on the board.

299
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:56,059
We have one L.

300
00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:02,219
There are no A's. That seems insane.

301
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:18,150
Can I play the game? I feel like I've gotten something bad

302
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:37,210
every turn I do.

303
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:43,300
Is it like a utensil or

304
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,570
appliance? There's going to be a lot of E's.

305
00:46:48,570 --> 00:47:16,150
Delicious.

306
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:27,210
Doil.

307
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:36,949
That constant L.

308
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:41,190
Doi?

309
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:45,940
I'm going with E. Let's go.

310
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,940
Alright.

311
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:55,510
Embroidered.

312
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:04,860
Embroiled.

313
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,219
Embroiled.

314
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:15,880
Emperors.

315
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:22,550
What the fuck is this?

316
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:29,340
Embroidered.

317
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,699
It's embroidered. It has to be.

318
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:40,230
Embroidered.

319
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:48,940
Dogles.

320
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,389
Doil.

321
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:58,570
Doppel.

322
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:03,429
Duol.

323
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:07,429
Wow. My buttons got shocked in real life.

324
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:13,139
I'm going to cry. What happened? What is a fucking doily?

325
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:21,349
A doily is a real word?

326
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,349
What is a doily?

327
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:29,349
These words are fucking weird.

328
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:42,300
I hit A first. I hit A first. That's bullshit.

329
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:54,010
Yes. Of course it's grape yogurt. Of course it is.

330
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:16,199
Got it. It's grape yogurt. Come on. I'm still in it.

331
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,199
I can win it right here. It's going to do good.

332
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:32,550
Doilies are those things? Does anybody have a doily in their house?

333
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:38,889
Or is there one up?

334
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:52,389
Yeah, sure. Those doilies,

335
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:56,389
I thought they were bibs.

336
00:50:56,389 --> 00:51:14,170
Alright. I need to get this.

337
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:30,619
I don't know.

338
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:40,409
This is a place.

339
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:45,030
The hyphen always fucks with me.

340
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,030
Messes with me a lot.

341
00:51:49,030 --> 00:52:05,239
How is this not furniture store?

342
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:14,199
Furniture hyphen, I don't know. Furniture subway.

343
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,380
Furniture slash Taco Bell.

344
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,380
That's not...

345
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,619
How would that have been

346
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:41,369
furniture store?

347
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:46,949
Yeah, dude. What am I talking about?

348
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,849
I know it.

349
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:04,539
It's the sorting goods, sorting foods store.

350
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:08,539
It's the sporting goods store. Of course it is. I'm trying to fuck with the person that's taking the test.

351
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:14,440
The sorting foods store, aka a grocery store.

352
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,369
The sorting foods store. Alright, those are two warmups.

353
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:29,139
One more. One more and that's it. One more. Good luck.

354
00:53:52,469 --> 00:54:02,789
That's making it so easy now.

355
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:32,969
Letters?

356
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:39,059
Alright, so it's barn leaders?

357
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,059
We only have a short amount of time, so go ahead and solve.

358
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:51,719
Wow, you won the bonus round. And the prize is...

359
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,719
Well, I think you'll be happy with this one.

360
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:08,969
The leader of the barn. The guy that makes all the...

361
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:20,170
One more and that's it. Porn letters, yeah. It's the guy that makes the animals.

362
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:30,360
Okay, let's go. You have to buy vowels. You don't get paid for...

363
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:38,420
Yeah, I know, I know. This guy's a streamer, not a novelist.

364
00:55:38,420 --> 00:56:10,260
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

365
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:36,099
What am I doing? Stop. I just want brightness. Okay, let's go for it.

366
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:43,269
Dude, just play it in the dark.

367
00:56:43,269 --> 00:57:02,340
Place.

368
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:25,590
Antique flea market.

369
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:29,590
I need all this money. Movie title. Come on, I should get this.

370
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,590
All I do is watch movies. The last movie I saw was

371
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:45,000
The Rise of Skywalker.

372
00:57:45,000 --> 00:58:08,730
Did you not know it?

373
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:16,039
Manchester...

374
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:22,969
I've never heard of this movie. Manchester by the Sea?

375
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:29,059
What movie is that?

376
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:33,750
Living Things.

377
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:50,329
Shock.

378
00:58:50,329 --> 00:59:49,269
Okay.

379
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:55,670
One of these days, you're going to fuck that up.

380
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:01,639
And you're going to be mad that you did. At some point during

381
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,639
one of these rounds, you're going to screw that up and it's going to lose you the game.

382
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:18,199
I think I know. I like to solve, please.

383
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:22,949
Yeah, I do. I can't even do the joke.

384
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:27,510
Fuck. Oh, no.

385
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:32,260
I was going to say, sheesh.

386
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:36,260
But I can't even make the joke, so now it's fucked up.

387
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,269
Now I have to get it right. I was just trying to make the two people here laugh.

388
01:00:41,269 --> 01:01:32,329
I'm still going to win this.

389
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:36,329
I was still going to win this. Just watch.

390
01:01:36,329 --> 01:02:12,739
I have to win one before I turn the stream off. I have to.

391
01:02:12,739 --> 01:02:17,880
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Oh, fuck.

392
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:31,340
Give it to me, give it to me. I know it.

393
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:42,619
I know it. I know it.

394
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:50,550
I know it. I know it.

395
01:02:50,550 --> 01:03:08,679
I know it.

396
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:19,639
You motherfucker.

397
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:25,099
Come on.

398
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:30,170
That's it.

399
01:03:30,170 --> 01:04:10,530
Come on. 900. There it is. That's a great start. S. I'm going to say T. Okay. I'm going

400
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:20,420
to say there's probably an H, but I'm going to say T. Yup. Okay. This is around the house.

401
01:04:20,420 --> 01:05:31,380
Let's keep going. I'll take 650. I'll take it. All right. Like shoveling. Is it going to be an R? It has to be. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I think I know another one. I think I know what one of these words is. Yup. Okay. All right. All right. Let me get a vowel. Really? I don't know what that word is. Give me another one. E.

402
01:05:32,929 --> 01:06:40,739
Yes, we have some. Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's build up a shitload of money. Let's run away with it. Okay. Yes, we have some. All right. All right. I'm going for more money. One more. That's it. 600. Yes, we have some. Scented dryer sheets. Scented, scented, scented.

403
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:56,190
Scented candles. Scented. I don't know. Scented something. Scented something. Scented something. I'm going to spin it again.

404
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:20,420
We don't seem to have any of those. I don't know. I freaked out because of the fucking timer.

405
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:49,280
We have one W. Scented dryer. Scented dryer. What are you talking about? Who has a scented

406
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:56,670
draw in their house? What kind of fucked up weirdo are you that you have a scented like a clothing

407
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:05,920
draw? What are they talking about? What are these fucked up terms that nobody has or nobody uses?

408
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:30,060
What? What in the name of God is this fucking product? Scented draw liners? No one has these.

409
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:38,399
No, not a single solitary fucking human on earth. A scented draw liner.

410
01:08:44,289 --> 01:09:03,460
What is going on here? Scented draw liner? Old people don't even have that.

411
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:20,340
Scented draw liner. Why would you want that? What, to make all your clothes smell like vanilla,

412
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:24,819
apple, cinnamon bullshit? What the fuck is that for? I'm dead serious. Take off emote only.

413
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:29,460
Explain it to me. Take it off emote only. I want it to be explained to me in full detail.

414
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:58,960
I've never heard of them. I have no idea. I have them. They're nice. Your draws smell.

415
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:09,920
I'm dead serious. Wait, in your... Okay. It's to keep clothes fresh. I don't want that.

416
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:24,239
I don't want to have some fucking chemical ass smell in my draw. What's the point of cleaning

417
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:31,439
your clothes? I'm serious. What's the point of doing laundry if you're going to put your

418
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:40,000
clean clothes into a scented draw? It's for a kitchen. Why do you want your utensils to smell?

419
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:53,579
I don't get it. I don't understand what that's for. One million.

420
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,189
Okay. One million. Yes. Gee. Fuck you. Unfortunately, there are none on the board.

421
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:11,710
I'm sorry. Yeah. All these people. Yeah. All you guys in chat with doilies and scented draws.

422
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:51,140
I don't know what alien planet that you're on. Yes, we have some hearts.

423
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,569
Don't go and spend all that at once now. I'm going to come in last place again.

424
01:11:58,289 --> 01:12:30,859
Next contestants, it's your turn. People. Okay. Well, very obviously. I know what the second

425
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:44,079
word is. Do why wouldn't they? Can they make a wheel of fortune with like Diablo two items?

426
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,000
Can we do that? Like I want, you know what I mean? Like I want, that would be more interesting to me.

427
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,979
Not doily fucking draw liners. Is there like a gamer version? Is it like a nerd version?

428
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:24,350
Scented Diablo two items. That dude, that's the virgin version. Okay.

429
01:13:24,989 --> 01:13:34,640
Do we have any of those? I actually, I know what this is. So I'm going to try to make some

430
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:39,390
fucking money. I know the answer to this question. I'm going to try to make some money

431
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:46,210
because I have to. I swear to God, I'm installing the game right now. I'm going to uninstall it.

432
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:49,090
There's no risk. That's like the sixth or seventh time I've landed on that.

433
01:13:49,729 --> 01:14:09,899
I've landed on that 40% of every spin. Bankrupt should not be in four spaces on the map. It

434
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:14,140
should be in literally one. It shouldn't even be on the map. What's the point of that being there?

435
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:27,390
I know that I know this. I literally would say it out loud right now,

436
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:48,289
but I still have a chance to make some money. Bankrupt. Bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt,

437
01:14:48,289 --> 01:15:01,039
lose a turn, lose a turn, bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt. Yeah. Board of directors. Great.

438
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,600
I would have been able to do that if this stupid fucking game that has been around since like

439
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:19,659
1700 had didn't have bankrupt slots. You know, I'll never understand that these some of these

440
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:27,420
old games, there's like go to zero on the board, but then there's also things are worth five

441
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:32,300
times points in round three. What the hell are you even trying to have it be based on skill

442
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:39,180
or are you having to be bullshit RNG nonsense dog shit? Bankrupt times five points. It doesn't

443
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:51,489
matter. You get one thing right in the fucking last round. Your chance to solve food and drink.

444
01:15:52,210 --> 01:16:38,079
I know it. I know it. All right, dude, you made this joke like five times. What are you me? Here

445
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:48,560
goes one last spin. How do I just keep leaning on bankrupt? I hate game shows that do this.

446
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:57,409
It's so stupid. Go to zero times 10 points. What's the point of having a fucking wheel

447
01:16:57,409 --> 01:17:03,409
if it doesn't matter until the last spin of the game? You heard the buzzer. That means time is up.

448
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:23,789
Yes, we have some. Just have no rounds then. Your chance to solve. No, it's not cheese.

449
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:54,979
I don't know. No, we don't seem to have any of those. Yes, we have some essence.

450
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:04,109
Well, that is a healthy amount to add to your winnings tonight. Contestant number three,

451
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:32,079
your chance to solve. RNG bankruptcy is stupid, especially when you land on it

452
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:58,979
10 times over the course of an hour. Sleep. Time is running low. Only sleep. Sleep. I don't know.

453
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:01,939
Wait, just pass. Yeah, you got to pass. Otherwise you're going to lose points.

454
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:11,439
Oh, I don't know. Sheep. I don't know.

455
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:24,319
Yes, we have some peas. I guess you'll be paying for dinner tonight.

456
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:35,500
Contestant number two, you like to solve? What? Oh, god damn it. How do I leave the game?

457
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:57,420
My brain was just like sheep pot pie. One more and no more of this dog shit bankrupt RNG nonsense.

458
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:08,939
Would you come up with that? But that's not even fair. I got bankrupt like three times.

459
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:13,260
Our lucky contestant looks eager to start the bonus round. So let's get over there.

460
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:26,319
This should be a slaughter rule. If you land on bankruptcy more than three times in a game,

461
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:35,949
you just get like five grand. Showbiz. There are six letters we can give you. R, S, T, L, N,

462
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:40,750
and E. Let's see what kind of help we can get. Would you please choose three consonants and a

463
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:58,270
vowel? Nice scented drawers. You're having you're having general sows tofu. That's just

464
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:04,579
the kind of sounds good. Like general general gouse chicken right now. Oh, man, that sounds good.

465
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:27,859
So get ready to solve. That sounds good. Broadway writer actor. No Broadway writer.

466
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:41,539
General Gao. General so general sow general. Yeah, I know guys. Do you really go look up

467
01:21:41,539 --> 01:21:54,979
that the origin of this? It's a different menu item everywhere. 10 seconds remaining.

468
01:21:55,779 --> 01:22:06,500
While you got the most money, you didn't get the bone. But I think you should still be happy

469
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:15,380
at different restaurants. It's general T, S, O, general T, like sow, tau, god. It's listed

470
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:31,229
at different things. I don't even care if you stream snipe. Just go on. Let's go one more.

471
01:22:31,229 --> 01:22:52,500
Yeah, there's actually an argument as to who made it up. Like, where did it come from?

472
01:22:55,340 --> 01:23:05,300
Look into it. What was it? Why is everybody laughing? Why is everybody laughing?

473
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:18,340
You had to pay for a Nintendo Switch subscription with that name to get started.

474
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:23,380
Thank you for joining us today. Your outfit looks quite interesting. You must have visited

475
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:28,420
the customization menu. It says here. Well, it doesn't say much. Why don't you tell us about

476
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:38,079
yourself? Get ready for the toss up. The category on this one is free. There we go. We got these two

477
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:51,739
dorks in the Wheel of Fortune shirts. It looks like you're ready to solve contestant number two.

478
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:12,750
I would have gotten this wrong. I would have gotten this wrong. Wow. I'm so glad it wasn't me. But in

479
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:21,310
case in case he's got it wrong, I got it. It's me. It's me. I got it at the crack of dawn.

480
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:38,380
I was gonna say I thought I had it wrong. Okay. All right. At the crack of dawn.

481
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:55,439
Okay, come on. Let's go. Things. Trousers. Oops. Oh my god. Oops. I fucked it up. It's um,

482
01:24:57,979 --> 01:25:05,970
shit. I didn't mean to do that. I just saw the second word. I know what the second word is,

483
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:20,270
but what's the first word? Collapsible. I don't I know what the second word is.

484
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:29,890
I know what I fucking don't care. I don't know. Contestant number three, your chance to solve

485
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:45,789
all. Columbus? Columbus umbrella? What is a Columbus umbrella? What are these things I've

486
01:25:45,789 --> 01:26:05,380
never heard of before? Columbus? What is a Columbus umbrella? Okay, dude, what are you doing? Why would

487
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:19,539
you do? Um, excuse me? What? No answers from the contestants. Let's try again. Good to see our

488
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:25,380
contestants are so eager to play. We shouldn't keep them waiting. So wait, we all lost.

489
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:31,460
Contestant number one, go ahead and take the first spin. I thought a Columbus umbrella was gonna be

490
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:35,460
all right. Yeah, I'll give you a Columbus umbrella. Like, I don't know. I thought it was like a

491
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:46,220
specific kind of umbrella. Yeah, it's like super durable. It could take you across the Atlantic.

492
01:26:46,220 --> 01:27:03,779
I don't know, man. I have no idea. L. Dude, you're cooked. I'd rather be cooked than raw.

493
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:16,850
Let's just put it that way. Fortunately, there are none on the board. I'm sorry.

494
01:27:33,859 --> 01:28:41,060
600. Yes, we have some s's. Okay. That's a fair bit of cash. Silly songs. No H. Okay. One on the

495
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:57,140
board. See, then it sucks. Sucks when it happens, doesn't it? Bankrupt is always a pain. Sucks when

496
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:04,159
it happens, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. Let's get us a vowel here. What vowel would you like?

497
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:14,640
Something E. I want another one. You've certainly, unfortunately, that's not what we

498
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:35,840
have a idea of what that first word is. But I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying to.

499
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,939
I can't say the I wish I could like mute and be like in a different channel.

500
01:29:42,939 --> 01:30:28,260
It looks like you're ready to solve. You're gonna solve. Really? No, you don't know this. What's

501
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:40,819
everybody just munching on the keyboard until the 10 seconds remain? Soil. Soil jug. I think,

502
01:30:40,819 --> 01:30:59,310
honestly, I think the host would be like, everything all right. Are you okay? I know

503
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:11,180
what the first word is. Let's see if I can get it by playing. I can't say it. I love.

504
01:31:11,180 --> 01:32:04,000
All right. All right. Okay. Come on. What? No, no, no, no. Back, back, back, back. I know it. I

505
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,399
know the answer. I know the answer. I know the answer. I know the answer. I know the answer.

506
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,720
I actually know the answer now. I want to go back. I'm literally going to quit the game if

507
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:33,899
I get bankrupt. Smiling emojis. Let's go. First place. First place. Let's go. First place.

508
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:42,369
Are we all ready to start? Yes. Fun and games. Contestant number two. Why don't you go ahead

509
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:59,779
and take the first spin? All right. Now flip it and get bankrupt. Not a single one on the board.

510
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:05,329
I don't even see what you picked. I wish he would say the letter because sometimes it happens so

511
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:54,659
quickly that I don't even know what letter it was. Fun and games. 500. M. Tycoon management.

512
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:38,270
500. That's a fair bit of cash you picked up. 650. 650. Yes, we have some arms. I guess you'll be

513
01:34:38,270 --> 01:35:25,819
paying for dinner tonight. What is that second word? Trump? Oh, I'm going to get it. I just have

514
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:33,489
to be careful. I'm going to try to make some extra money here, but I do know the second word.

515
01:35:38,590 --> 01:36:15,409
650. Yep. What is the first word? It's so close. 700. Okay. Is it only vowels? What?

516
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:24,109
You can certainly buy a vowel. What would you like? What kind of trampoline is this?

517
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:46,529
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. But I'm going to spin for extra money.

518
01:36:47,170 --> 01:37:12,939
More money. Again. One more. Yep. Yep. Yep. How does this work?

519
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:34,100
All right. I'm going to solve it now. Backyard trampoline. Oh no. It's trampoline. Right?

520
01:37:34,979 --> 01:38:00,560
Backyard trampoline. All right. Over 5k. That's quite a lot. This would be the one to go out on

521
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:17,060
it. If I can get it, I'll go out on this one. 700. Yes. We have some before and after. Great job.

522
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:36,500
That's quite a bit of cash in your pocket now. 650. Will we get any help? Okay. This is where I can

523
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:52,239
run away with it. Let me do the bonus round too. Come on. We're going with an H. Unfortunately,

524
01:38:52,239 --> 01:39:14,560
there are none on the board. I'm sorry. This is the last round, right? There's nothing else after

525
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:27,550
this. I don't think. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a first time chatter here. Omni Jack. Welcome to

529
01:40:32,300 --> 01:41:04,739
a fair bit of cash. I don't like this. Come on. Lose it all. Lose it all right here. What's the

01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:43,170

01:41:44,130 --> 01:42:02,159
Baseball diamond earrings. This game is fucking terrible. What a what a dog shit game this really

538
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:14,239
You just picked three random words and put them together and instead it was a fucking

539
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:43,859
random name. Only 10 seconds remaining. You got it. Let's get this round started.

540
01:43:49,329 --> 01:44:04,130
I'll give the wheel one last pick. Let's go. Oh it's a phrase. The phrase is shoe chowder. Okay.

541
01:44:04,770 --> 01:44:33,020
Any of those? No. I'm R. Contestant number one. I can't solve it with that. We have one S. Good

01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:40,939

01:46:40,939 --> 01:46:57,340
there are none on the board. How is there no A in this whole thing? Oh so sorry time is up.

549
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:18,260
Will we get any help on this? It seems we're out of luck. What is this word man? Unfortunately

I thought it was just like oh fashion and jewelry designer. There's a controversy. They've been

624
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:10,699
feeding them answers in the sub discord. Controversy alert. While you got the most money.

625
02:06:12,579 --> 02:06:15,699
I'm not done. I'm literally doing one more and I'm fucking out of here. I don't care what happens.

626
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:30,189
I can't believe they gave me the answer. See what you should have done is you should have

627
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:40,850
wrote answer and then delete it and then write it. I. Jewelry. Jewelry. It just doesn't look

628
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:57,039
right. You know. Hold on. Let me. I could write this out. Jewelry. No it doesn't. Yeah.

629
02:06:57,939 --> 02:07:18,989
It doesn't look right. I thought like jewelry. Jewelry. Whatever. Jewelry is traditional British.

630
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:31,699
I'm swear to god. Right. I thought it was like jewelry. Not like jewelry. Right. That's not an

631
02:07:31,699 --> 02:07:44,689
inaccurate way to spell it. It's like with two L's. Right. Jewelry is a. Jewelry is correct.

632
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:55,439
Jewelry is some. I'll take that. A great. We're ready to get started. It says it's American and

633
02:07:55,439 --> 02:08:02,659
British English. Hold on. I want to look this up. Jewelry. Thank you for joining us today.

634
02:08:02,659 --> 02:08:08,100
Your outfit looks quite interesting. You must. It's time for a toss up round for one thousand

635
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:16,029
dollars. The category. Jewelry. Jewelry is the American English and jewelry is the British

636
02:08:16,029 --> 02:08:35,500
English. The British fucking English is the correct one. Contestant number two. I thought

637
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:49,659
there was more word letters. Undy. So yeah. I had it right. It's just another way to spell it.

638
02:08:50,300 --> 02:09:01,680
What is it? Food and drink. All right. Come on. You suck. These names are killing me.

639
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:18,319
All right. Come on. That was. I don't think you're going to be. I don't think you know.

640
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:33,390
Yeah. What's the British way to spell this part? Wait. What do you. Wait. Hold on. Wait. I'm going

641
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:46,989
to get it wrong. What? Contestant number three. I pressed. I pressed the button. What? Uncle Ben's

642
02:09:47,390 --> 02:10:13,539
couldn't. Converted rice. No sense in. Let's go ahead and get. Let's get. I thought it was.

643
02:10:14,739 --> 02:10:25,939
I thought it was convenient. Contestant converted rice. So take a spin. Coveted rice.

644
02:10:38,539 --> 02:11:05,899
Sorry. I got a little worked up. Very sorry. Just try to keep positive thoughts now.

645
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:24,380
They're cheating in the substream in the discord. Bunch of cheaters. Fine. You want to cheat? I'll

646
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:50,479
take you on right now. I'll beat the cheaters. It's fine. Yes. We have some teams. Go ahead.

647
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:20,420
What is it? With your free play. You aren't out of it yet. You've certainly got the money. We have

648
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:46,930
one. President sleeper. Stop. Will we get any help on this? It seems we're out of luck.

649
02:12:49,090 --> 02:13:08,899
Stop. Ow. I unplugged it. Why would there be a fucking bee? You dumbass. No, I pulled this out

650
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:36,560
and I did. Why did that? I'm selling an explosion. Unfortunately, there are none on the board. I'm

651
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:43,579
sorry. I was ignoring answers in chat to be fair, but people were blowing up my DMS with answers.

652
02:13:44,300 --> 02:14:08,060
I'm blowing up my DMS with answers. What was that? C? P. That's a fair bit of cash.

653
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:31,229
Something Pat. Pat? We have one. Go ahead and pick a card from the-

654
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:37,789
Pate. Pato. Potato. Sure, you can buy a vowel. Yes, we have some P's.

655
02:14:37,789 --> 02:14:48,079
What? Pat? Ben Patty's?

656
02:14:59,579 --> 02:15:18,939
700. Yes, we have some N's. It's crazy just how- This is new. What? Contestant number three,

657
02:15:18,939 --> 02:15:31,170
your chance to solve. New patience? But how is that for a people? I mean, I guess it technically

658
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:40,369
is people. This is so vague. How did you come up with that? Don't skip it. I want to see it.

659
02:15:40,369 --> 02:15:51,069
Let's go ahead and start the round. Holy shit. This is almost a full board. I'm going to give

660
02:15:51,069 --> 02:15:57,390
the wheel another spin. I'm thinking of a person's name, right? But it's not a person, it's people.

661
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:18,720
Yes, we have some A's. Barbecue and sour onion. Pringles. How would I know?

662
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:39,739
Fortunately, you ran out of time. Yes, we have some R's. That sounds actually really good.

663
02:16:39,739 --> 02:16:44,459
Barbecue Pringles right now. I actually think barbecue anything. Barbecue chips are disgusting.

664
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:51,579
To me, barbecue flavored chips of any kind are fucking gross.

665
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:07,219
Yes, we have some E's. Barbecue chips to me taste kind of like I'm smelling them. I'm not tasting

666
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:13,620
them. It's like a scent. It's not even a flavor. It's like I can smell them in my mouth. Does that

667
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:28,299
make any sense? No, no, I don't want to do that. Barbecue chips smell like coffee breath. Yes,

668
02:17:28,299 --> 02:17:38,350
we have some P's. It's just like an off-putting aroma. Contestant number two, would you like to

669
02:17:38,350 --> 02:18:18,770
solve? Kakarots and Mie. Okay, this is a meme answer. Josh. Kakarots and Mie Josh. All right.

670
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:28,850
Yes, we have some N's. Great job. That's quite a bit of cash. Contestant number three,

671
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:41,860
your chance to solve. I feel like the second word, we all know what it is. Yes, some C's.

672
02:18:42,659 --> 02:18:52,879
Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Great job. Contestant number one, your chance to solve.

673
02:19:00,819 --> 02:19:16,129
Macaroni and cheese. Macaroni and cheese. What else do you? Macaroni and cheese.

674
02:19:17,379 --> 02:19:30,979
Crisps. Macaroni and cheese. Baked ziti. Macaroni and cheese. Food re-crisps. Cream.

675
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:40,510
Macaroni and cheese. Whipped cream. Macaroni and cheese. Croc. Macaroni and cheese.

676
02:19:42,979 --> 02:20:09,069
Pepper and macaroni and cheese. I don't know. Yes, we have contestant number two.

677
02:20:09,069 --> 02:20:19,860
Macaroni and cheese. But anytime I think of macaroni and cheese, I don't think of

678
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:28,340
four other words. Macaroni and cheese Josh. Is this this person's name?

679
02:20:29,299 --> 02:20:41,709
Macaroni and cheese Josh breadcrumbs. Oh my fucking God. It's with breadcrumb topping.

680
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:51,790
No human says it like this. They say, oh yeah, I brought mac and cheese. Oh yes,

681
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:55,680
I brought mac and cheese with breadcrumb topping. No, you just say mac and cheese.

682
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:00,879
Don't say all this. This is like a word soup. Macaroni and cheese with breadcrumb topping.

683
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:10,379
You just say macaroni and cheese. So sorry, but time is out.

684
02:21:10,459 --> 02:21:27,200
All right, you fail it too, so I win. Yes, we have some eyes. This is British. Contestant number

685
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,159
three. No, but macaroni and cheese with breadcrumb topping. To me, that's that's more than one thing

686
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:40,959
you're talking. Macaroni and cheese. Macaroni and tweez with oh my goodness. All right, then I'll

687
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:57,620
get it then guys. Yes, we have some bones. I think I still lose. Contestant number one to solve.

688
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:13,950
Macaroni and cheese with breadcrumb topping. I was thinking like with something else or with

689
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:26,159
bacon on it or I don't know or another food. All right, actual last one. Truly last one. I swear.

690
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:31,059
I promise this is the last one. I'm not doing another one after this no matter what. I promise

691
02:22:31,059 --> 02:22:37,680
no matter what. No matter what. I think we're ready to start the bonus round. Let's get over there.

692
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:59,709
Please follow me over to food and drink. I think you know the letters. R, S, T, L, N, N, E. Let's

693
02:22:59,709 --> 02:23:04,290
see what kind of help you can get. Stop saying this is the last one no matter what. This is the

694
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:11,059
final one no matter what. If I don't leave, I'll just say end stream. I'll just go and press it.

695
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:26,299
Wow, you made that look easy. This is it for real. I know it's getting late.

696
02:23:29,299 --> 02:23:35,309
I know it's getting late. This will be it. I promise. This is it. Okay, time is limited,

697
02:23:35,309 --> 02:23:40,059
so solve the puzzle. Okay, good luck. Food and drink. Something. Cookies.

698
02:23:40,860 --> 02:24:10,319
You swing an axe at mail budget. No, you won't. Oh, yeah, I will. Yeah, I like I should have been

699
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:17,809
like a boxer. I wouldn't get touched once. I wouldn't get hit by one punch. It would be like

700
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:24,639
I wouldn't get hit one time. Not once. You got the most money. You didn't get the

701
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:37,659
bone. Batch of warm cookies. You should still be happy with that. If I was in the medieval times

702
02:24:38,219 --> 02:24:40,940
and we were at like we were in a battle, I wouldn't get hit once.

703
02:24:57,979 --> 02:25:09,260
Somebody said you're hallucinating. Dude, fuck up. You would have died of the plague,

704
02:25:11,309 --> 02:25:23,579
not of a punch in the face or an axe to the head. Yeah, I would have eaten the old sandwich on the

705
02:25:23,579 --> 02:25:33,680
ground and died from the plague. That would be etched on my gravestone. It says here it doesn't

706
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:43,549
say much. Why don't you tell us about yourself? But on my gravestone, it'd say here lies Sir Jeremy

707
02:25:43,549 --> 02:25:50,829
Albertson, the swift. And it would say you have my record on it. It'd be like five hundred and

708
02:25:50,829 --> 02:26:12,750
zero. Five hundred zero dash zero. What are you doing? It looks like you're ready to solve

709
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:20,420
contestant number three. Jeremy, you danced on stream once and had to take a month off.

710
02:26:21,139 --> 02:26:26,340
No, I danced on stream and realized how bad my condition was. So then I decided to take a month

711
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:31,299
off. I could dance right now and be fine. No, I'm not going to do that. There was no accent

712
02:26:31,299 --> 02:26:35,459
involved. There was no there was no battle acts. There was no sword, no broadsword, no bastard sword.

713
02:26:35,459 --> 02:26:40,340
How lucky they are. Shall we go ahead and start the round? Dude, I'm going to go to like a,

714
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:45,940
I'm going to go to like a larping event thing or like a martial artist place and go there and be

715
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:52,610
like, come get me and just dodge everything. Is this going to end up like, didn't Steven Seagal

716
02:26:52,610 --> 02:27:03,149
do this? He was like pushing people over. How fucking funny would it be though if I like got

717
02:27:03,709 --> 02:27:10,750
a real professional martial artist facility to humor me and they just beat the shit out of me.

718
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:16,399
I was like, all right, let's go. And it was just like, oh, oh, and I was like, stop, stop,

719
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:26,639
I'm sorry. And that was the whole stream. And then I turned it off. I'm not messing around.

720
02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:40,909
Okay. You're not messing around. I love how this person is communicating with us.

721
02:27:41,940 --> 02:28:01,809
I'm not messing around. Smile. Okay. There you go. There you go. Why am I smiling like an alien?

722
02:28:01,809 --> 02:28:18,110
What if he heard what a smile was? No, what am I doing? I'm an alien. Don't seem to have any of

723
02:28:18,110 --> 02:29:39,360
those. Oh, it's my turn. Oh, all right. You're good. Pretty good.

724
02:29:47,520 --> 02:30:02,110
I love all the people dancing over here. Is it the music? You're dancing to the music.

725
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:17,569
This is a fun stream. Play three games today. I usually don't do that. Maybe one or two.

726
02:30:17,569 --> 02:30:50,239
I usually don't do three. This one. Okay. I know it. I want money. I know this one.

727
02:30:50,879 --> 02:31:01,659
I'm going to try to get as much cash as I possibly can. This would be the Sydney Opera House

728
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:06,639
for all of you in the chat. Why don't you get home? That's a fair bit of cash.

729
02:31:10,180 --> 02:31:26,030
Just no bankrupt bullshit, please. Yes, we have some wines.

730
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:36,510
All right. One more and that's it. No more. No bankrupt. No bankrupt. No bankrupt. No bankrupt.

731
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:48,500
No bankrupt. No bankrupt. Don't do it. 2,500. I'd like to solve a puzzle, please.

732
02:31:49,299 --> 02:31:54,670
Contestant number or chance to solve

733
02:31:57,229 --> 02:32:07,549
Sydney Opera House. I'm going to actually win this one. I got lucky. Wow. That is incredible.

734
02:32:07,549 --> 02:32:16,049
How did you come up with that? Let's go ahead and start the round. Just don't lose it here

735
02:32:16,049 --> 02:32:30,510
at the end and I should be fine. Give the wheel another spin by 50. What are you doing?

736
02:32:31,389 --> 02:32:47,379
That's a lot of money too. It's really easy for somebody to get like 15,000 right now.

737
02:32:48,100 --> 02:33:15,729
I guess you'll be contestant number two. You're not a single one on the board. I'm sorry. Really?

738
02:33:15,729 --> 02:33:31,059
We don't seem to have any of those. Yes, we have some ends. I've got quite a bit of money now.

739
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:50,590
Contestant number two. Would you like to solve? Yes, we have some I. Contestant number three.

740
02:33:50,590 --> 02:34:31,969
Ing ing. Come on. Sussing. Sussing my. Oh no. Okay. Elaborate. Sussing my mouse.

741
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:45,149
Sussing my mousing. Time is running low. Sussing my jaw. What's with this? Josh just keeps writing

742
02:34:45,149 --> 02:34:53,180
his own name for the answers. Why? Why do you just keep writing your own name? E. Will we

743
02:34:53,180 --> 02:35:13,059
get any help on this? How is it not an E? This is the best controller by the way. The Switch Pro

744
02:35:13,059 --> 02:35:31,379
controller. Just kidding. Contestant number one. Your chance to solve. Is it not bad? Yes,

745
02:35:31,379 --> 02:35:35,780
we have some. It's not bad. The buttons could be a little better. I like the analogues though.

746
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:52,700
I like the mouth feel. Contestant number two. Your chance to solve. Making my Christmas list.

747
02:36:05,739 --> 02:36:18,049
Making my what? Making my. That's a fair bit. Contestant number three. Would you like to solve?

748
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:48,459
I still win. Making my soy list. Making my. All right. Yeah, you got it. You got it. I don't think

749
02:36:48,459 --> 02:37:09,069
you win though. It's gonna be close. Making my shopping list. Will you win the game if you do

750
02:37:09,069 --> 02:37:17,649
this? If you do, that's gonna be funny. You only have two seconds though. Oh, so sorry. No, I

751
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:34,799
would have won anyways. Finally, I win. All it took was somebody in chat to lose in front of me.

752
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:44,879
All right. Let's take this to the bonus round. That's it. Thanks for playing guys. Good job.

753
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:59,680
To be honest, I wasn't sure how you were gonna. Bonus round. Let's go.

754
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:02,319
I just realized the audio has been coming through the mic the entire time.

755
02:38:04,479 --> 02:38:16,350
G. Would you follow me over here please? Thing. We'll give you the typical letters. R, S, T, L, N,

756
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:31,389
and E. Free. Free. Three N's. Free. We have three consonants and a vowel please. I don't know.

757
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:55,200
P, B, H, and A. Wow, you made that look easy. Free bananas. Just a few moments to solve. So go

758
02:38:55,200 --> 02:39:44,899
quickly. Free man. Free. Free. Free man. Free man. Free man. Time is running low. Only 10

759
02:39:44,899 --> 02:39:54,379
seconds remaining. I don't know. I actually just don't know. While you got the most money,

760
02:39:54,379 --> 02:40:02,180
you didn't get the bonus, but I think you should still be happy with that cash.

761
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:22,770
Okay. Okay. All right. That's fun. This game's fun. Wheel of Fortune. I would love to see a

762
02:40:23,569 --> 02:40:31,780
nerd version though. That'd be good. All right. That's it. I'll see you guys later.

763
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:38,180
Thanks for watching. We went a little late, but I did start a little late so that's fine.

764
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:42,930
Really appreciate everyone sticking around. We did a lot of random stuff today.

765
02:40:45,090 --> 02:40:52,420
So the plan, I've got a lot of stuff going on this weekend. You probably will see me,

766
02:40:52,420 --> 02:40:59,940
you might see me at some point this weekend, but you will absolutely see me Monday or Tuesday.

767
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:09,229
There's a lot of stuff for baseball that I have to get done. So I need to take some more time.

768
02:41:09,229 --> 02:41:13,790
I think you'll probably see me on like Saturday. I'm going to try to stream Saturday.

769
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:28,180
Thanks for sticking around. Always fun. Games were interesting too. That first one was pretty

770
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:37,379
fun. Second one was pretty fun. Third one. I would like to see the rules change in Wheel of Fortune,

771
02:41:37,379 --> 02:41:47,680
but thanks for watching guys. Here's your outro music.

772
02:41:59,090 --> 02:42:21,120
Bring back the camera. This is the outro. We'll get, you know what? We'll probably,

773
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:26,850
I know I keep putting it off, but I just don't feel like getting scared. The next time I stream,

774
02:42:26,850 --> 02:42:40,959
hold me to this. We're going to do some of the Dread X stuff. Put it in the suss so I can't

775
02:42:40,959 --> 02:43:03,329
change it. There's still unpaid debt. Yeah, there is a lot of it. What's Dread X? It's a

776
02:43:03,329 --> 02:43:08,579
kind of like a Jackbox party pack of horror games. They've made about five or six of them,

777
02:43:08,579 --> 02:43:26,940
right? I'm looking forward to it. All right guys. See you later. Thanks for watching.

778
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:32,799
Good night. Goodbye. See you maybe on Saturday. If not, then absolutely on Monday or Tuesday.

779
02:43:32,799 --> 02:43:38,819
And I'm very excited. I cannot wait for this baseball stream. It's going to be so much fun.

780
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:44,299
Take care guys. See you later.
