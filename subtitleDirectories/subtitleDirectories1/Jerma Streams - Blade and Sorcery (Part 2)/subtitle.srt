1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:09,900
Alright, hello. We'll go for a little bit longer. We'll do some of the Blade and Sorcery update.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:22,870
It should be opening now. You should see it on your screen in about five seconds.

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:46,439
One, two, three, four, five, six. Alright, Blade and Sorcery. I'm ready.

4
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:59,189
We probably will put the cap on. Maybe we'll go back another day on disassembly. It's so much fun.

5
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,789
It's just such a relaxing game. If you want a relaxing, just chill

6
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:11,109
and cry on the ground because a microwave won't open. It's fun. It's 30 bucks, so it's a little

7
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:17,349
one on the expensive side for a VR experience, but it's still good and there's a ton of content.

8
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:34,969
Why is everybody laughing? Did I brush my teeth? What? What are you guys talking about?

9
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:40,920
What the hell are you talking about? I can't even see. I gotta see what you guys are saying.

10
00:01:46,780 --> 00:02:04,890
Back in the closet. Nope, no one's in there. You guys are fucking twisting me up. I have

11
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:34,060
to check every time now. Alright, so where are my hands? Well, there's one hand. Alright,

12
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:53,030
this is where I was before. Let's go. Next. Oh, whoops. Play. Calibrate. Blade and Sorcery.

13
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:05,050
It's been a while. I kind of forget how to play. We will continue. I believe it is right. Oh,

14
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:12,819
my god, that I'm running too fast. Oh, you have to move your hands, right? And then it's,

15
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:29,050
yep, it is the right trigger, the right grip. Already fucking shit up. Watch me take the tip

16
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,659
of the candle. Oh, it was a trash can. Either one. Alright, let's go. You can do two grip

17
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:43,610
at the same time. If I remember correctly, you can, right? Maybe not on this particular sword.

18
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,610
You got stuff in your pockets. You can dagger and then either holster over here.

19
00:03:49,379 --> 00:04:00,219
So what we got? Canyon. Arena. Market. Unknown location. Work in progress.

20
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:23,610
Should we go check it out? What's new? Upstairs. Cool. So, god damn it.

21
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:37,079
It's getting worse, the amount of things I'm going to smash into. Honestly. Did my room get

22
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:57,779
smaller? I feel like the room got smaller. Take his arms. The room got smaller. It did.

23
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:09,139
Look at this. I'm already hitting shit. My room shrunk by like 45%. What's up there,

24
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:33,939
anything? Alright, let's test out, oops. I like the spears the most out of all the weapons.

25
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:45,800
These are my favorites because you can just go like this and just fucking charge. Right in the

26
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,189
face. Right in the face. Right in the face. Alright. How do you, what's the throw? Isn't

27
00:05:53,189 --> 00:06:11,110
there a throw? Is it grip and then grip again? What is throw? Enable climbing?

28
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:25,370
They don't talk about the book so close to you. General climbing. Experimental. Player

29
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:50,970
invincibility. Physical climb. Physical climb. Alright, so what does that do? I can like use

30
00:06:50,970 --> 00:07:10,329
your weapon to climb. Oh, this is really weird. Oh, there's a chest up here. What's in the

31
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:33,899
chest? There's nothing in here? Oh, okay. Alright, let's go fight. Alright, what's in

32
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:47,850
these areas new? This ruins arena. I feel like, is Canyon new? Let's go check it out.

33
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:55,500
Oh, wow. Alright, we're gonna do very easy because I'm gonna get back to playing.

34
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:12,230
One of the potions, right? This is cool looking though. I like this, like the stabby sword.

35
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:34,649
Okay, let's get the potions ready. At least one of them. Alright, here we go. This is

36
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:45,340
the snake technique. Let's just do wave one. Let's just do very easy. Let's just, because

37
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:55,659
I gotta remember how to play. Here we go. Always have to be moving around in snake

38
00:08:55,659 --> 00:09:40,820
technique. What the hell happened? What? Why are they running away? Whoa! Already,

39
00:09:40,820 --> 00:10:26,659
oh, that's brutal. Um, I already, I already lost my headphone. Come here. I'm trying

40
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:54,809
to cut her leg off. Get me. Oh, he got me. Get him in the face of the shop. You'll

41
00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:29,269
be mine soon enough. We good? We did it. So you can cut people's arms and legs off.

42
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:48,220
Now I need to, I need to heal. Healing, please. Let's try, uh, something quick. Let's do two

43
00:11:48,220 --> 00:12:19,379
of these. It's hard to get the grips. The grips are right here. I need to, I gotta

44
00:12:19,379 --> 00:13:30,870
heal. Alright, let's do it again. Let's do wave three. Come here. Right in the neck.

45
00:13:40,549 --> 00:14:27,539
Oh! There's a wall. What? Whoa! Whoa! Hey! I'm trapped in a dream.

46
00:14:27,539 --> 00:15:45,139
I think I broke it. Just come over here. I, come on, get. Damn it. What? I have to,

47
00:15:45,139 --> 00:16:31,860
what the hell? I can't pick anything up. Oh, now you gave me a sword and now you're in big trouble.

48
00:16:48,419 --> 00:17:24,019
Get out of my fucking face. That's some good steam. That's some good steam. Climb with the

49
00:17:24,019 --> 00:18:07,369
axe. Holy shit. Is this getting over it? I need another axe. Let's go check over here.

50
00:18:07,369 --> 00:19:38,410
I wasn't prepared for that. Oh my god! Grabbed up! I just Super Mario'd a spear. Jesus Christ,

51
00:19:38,410 --> 00:20:27,079
my hand is shaky right now. Oh shit. Not what was intended. Not the flourishing move that I

52
00:20:27,079 --> 00:21:49,319
intended. I'm gonna put a fucking hole in my wall. VR is too dangerous. I swear.

53
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:38,809
Oh my god! I'm gonna throw it in my room. Get off my sword! Another one! Get off! Get off!

54
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:51,099
Oh, I just fucked up my hand. I just fucked up my hand, I think.

55
00:22:51,900 --> 00:23:02,019
Yeah, I did. Seriously. Oh, there's some skin ripped off there.

56
00:23:02,019 --> 00:24:58,759
There. It's brutal. Pogo stick with the spear. It's going through. Hold on. That's fun as hell.

57
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:05,109
That's fun as hell. All right, give me some healing. I'm gonna pogo stick for somebody's

58
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:43,559
head. I have to just goomba stomp somebody. So it's like up here. This is gonna be fucking

59
00:25:43,559 --> 00:26:37,240
ridiculous. Here we go. Oh, it's close! I got hit. I got caught. You're ruining my fun.

60
00:26:40,809 --> 00:27:01,369
Oh shit. Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo. I gotta do that again. I feel

61
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:19,269
like I could get it. I'm gonna skewer somebody. Oh my god, my back. Okay, let's go.

62
00:27:19,269 --> 00:28:04,920
But I need a lot of enemies. How do I track this down? There we go. Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!

63
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:42,180
Uh oh! Uh oh! Yes! Oh shit. I got it. Use the axe on the zipline? Oh man,

64
00:28:42,180 --> 00:29:40,700
that sounds like fun too. Axe on the zipline. All right, let's go for it. Um, haha! See you

65
00:29:40,779 --> 00:30:50,549
in hell. One, two, three. What? We both did the same thing. We both did the same fucking move.

66
00:30:51,190 --> 00:31:12,390
That was just Dark Souls PvP. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas.

67
00:31:12,390 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. We got a raid came in. How's my hand? It's all right.

68
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:15,180
A little wounded, but it's fine. Kiwo. Hey, Kiwo. Kiwo coming in with a raid. Oh,

69
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:22,980
all right. Kiwo did come in with a raid. Hello, everybody. I'm currently in the uh at like 245

70
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,819
calories burned and I'm already done. Kind of winded right now. Uh, we're doing blade and

71
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:33,559
sorcery. Thank you so much, Kiwo. I hope you had a good stream and welcome everybody.

72
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:45,420
We're doing a pogo stick technique. I'm gonna try it again. Sorry, I'm a little sweaty.

73
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,440
That's what happens when you get in the virtual world. All right, let's try pogo one

74
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,339
more time with like 30 enemies. But again, welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid, Kiwo.

75
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:27,670
Fuck yeah. Thank you. Uh, I think I know what's wrong. All right, pogo stick time.

76
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:44,789
We're good. This is like the funnest thing I've ever done. I wonder how high can you actually

77
00:33:44,789 --> 00:34:10,599
get? Oh shit. Okay, let's get back up there. Just run. Just run up there. You're too long.

78
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:35,000
There we go. Okay, I got my Garuva. Let's do it. It's just another heavy wave of monsters.

79
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,440
Here we go. This is hard. You can fall in a million different places.

80
00:34:40,440 --> 00:35:04,780
I'm gonna go up. Can I get up there? This is a gap here. This is, this is tricky.

81
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:27,449
There you go. Oh dear. Oh dear. I'm good. Ducked. You duck. How did you duck that?

82
00:35:36,710 --> 00:36:22,179
They're so good at dodging. Oh god. What happened? Oh, get it. Get it. Get it, guys.

83
00:36:22,179 --> 00:37:32,500
Come on. Oh, you pulled me. Come here, you son of a bitch. I'm getting pretty good at this.

84
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:48,659
Stay down. Just like rowing a boat. Check this. Ready? We're gonna end this one with a

85
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:56,250
flourish. Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

86
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:38,219
He ducked. I just shot himself with an arrow. Oh god. Oh god, it's over. Oh, no.

87
00:38:48,730 --> 00:39:54,940
Let go of this. What? Oh, fuck it. I got the double pogo. Oh, come on. What the hell?

88
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:58,039
What? How did I make two of you? How long is this fucking level? How many fucking enemies are

89
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:18,280
there? How many enemies are in the level? Did I beat it? I did it. That was hard.

90
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:30,679
That was on hard mode. Oh my goodness, I'm fucking exhausted. I actually fought

91
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:47,690
30 people in real life. And won. And I won. And I won. That was wave three, hard mode.

92
00:41:47,690 --> 00:42:10,869
The local man goes crazy in VR. You're crazy. What the fuck? Why? What? It's a video game.

93
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:32,300
You're sick, man. I think it's time for me to wind down. Close the closet. Okay.

94
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,070
Drink some water. I'm made out of 75% water. I'll just drink myself.

95
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:47,699
I'll be fine. No, I'll be fine. Oh, yeah, I think I'm gonna have to call it there. I'm

96
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:59,989
fucking destroyed. What? The Dane Axe? Okay. He's gone. No, not this shit again.

97
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:15,539
What's the Dane Axe? This one over here? I'll go easy. I don't gotta prove myself anymore.

98
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:30,139
I just pogo stick through hard mode. Yeah. Clip that one. Why the Dane Axe? What's the

99
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:57,690
cool about the Dane Axe? Is this the thing they can chop off heads? Climb with it.

100
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:31,449
I'll give it a try. God, it really is getting over it. Just VR. This is hard. That's a lot

101
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:46,860
harder than it looks. I don't think I'm, okay, I'm not supposed to be up there. It's like,

102
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,539
it's a good wall. Because I'm clearly up here. That's the problem. See, look. Okay.

103
00:44:52,260 --> 00:45:09,619
I'm, like, stuck on the edge. Bye! Okay, I'm fine. All right, let's do it. I'm just

104
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:12,949
gonna try to slaughter somebody with this. And then I gotta get out of here.

105
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:24,090
I'm past the point of tired at the moment. Burnt. All my fuel in my body has just turned into

106
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:33,659
burnt-out molecules. I'm gonna do an easy one. I wanna try to get somebody's head off.

107
00:45:33,659 --> 00:46:26,179
Like, clean off. Oh, no! Hold on. Time out. Time out, please. Oh, my God. That's gotta

108
00:46:26,179 --> 00:47:07,500
be nice and clean. Ah, come on. Close. I tried. Oh, that was perfect, too. Didn't

109
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:23,539
get the head off. Oh, no. That was an opportunity. Get back on the ground.

110
00:47:30,889 --> 00:48:04,630
Pretty good technique. I thought that guy was, I thought he was undead. Got it. All right.

111
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,789
That's gonna be it. I'm gonna go get some water. I'll come back onto the bits. We'll

112
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:19,019
hang up a little bit. I am fucking exhausted. More blood. Not tonight. I'll be right back.

113
00:48:19,019 --> 00:50:31,900
See you guys in a minute. That was weird. He was just still going, huh? They were

114
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:43,139
still fighting. Weirdly enough. Thanks, everybody, for watching. I'm fucking drained.

115
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,699
I gotta go take a shower. God, VR is so much fun. I wish I had the stamina to play it more.

116
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:57,500
I wish I wasn't such a boomer. But we're gonna do the bits. We're gonna hang up.

117
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:06,710
Shower stream. No. Think of it like getting really good exercise. Yeah, I know. It's

118
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:20,460
just spending four hours at the gym. Oh, Kiwo. Kiwo's still hanging around.

119
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:28,139
Kiwo, so what do you plan on the next few days? We were already talking.

120
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:37,420
And I'm not streaming tomorrow. I'm up in the air probably the next day or two. But

121
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:50,869
on tomorrow, today is Saturday, Sunday. On Monday or Tuesday, maybe we can figure

122
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:59,829
something out. Possibly. Wednesday? Thursday? You hurt your boyfriends and you abandoned him.

123
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:16,309
Oh, my. Oh, my. Why? What? That doesn't sound good. You're playing GTA RP? Oh, God.

124
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:39,500
I gotta stream. You gotta stream. RIP boyfriend. Yeah. Well, hopefully he understands.

125
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:49,739
Horrible girlfriend confirmed. But if you got time in the next week, I'll keep the VR

126
00:52:49,739 --> 00:53:05,079
hooked up and we can do some shit. Should be fun. You're gonna have to give me a tour of

127
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:14,900
VR chat with extreme, with extreme limits put on it. I have to have like five people

128
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:21,530
with shields that walk in front of me. We made you a glue man avatar. That's fucking amazing.

129
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:36,980
Are you serious? I cannot wait to see that. That's unbelievable. Hit me up on Discord.

130
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,800
We'll talk more about it. But I'll be around Monday or Tuesday. Maybe we can set something up

131
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,400
for like Tuesday or something. Because when are you getting back? Give you a day to settle

132
00:53:48,199 --> 00:54:02,119
whenever you're coming back. We have a rat related avatar. I cannot wait. It's just a

133
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:10,260
place to hang out and show off your expensive full body. That's fucking awesome. Surprise

134
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:16,039
avatar. I can't wait to see this. This is gonna be great. But yeah, thanks for the

135
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:23,099
raid again. Sorry we kind of stopped 2030 but it's after you came in. But I just I have no

136
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:34,059
stamina. Especially in this virtual world. The world that's in VR. No spoils. All right.

137
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:43,739
I'm looking forward to it. Whatever it is. But let's do the bits. Let's go back a few

138
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:53,480
hours ago. And we had five dollars coming from Afterlooksatrix. Thanks to the five

139
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,690
dollars. Hey Jerma, back in 2017 I sent a bit message saying I was going to France to meet

140
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:05,210
my boyfriend for the first time. Well this summer I'm moving in with him. Ain't that rad.

141
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:09,690
Anyway I've missed almost every live stream but I have watched every single VOD.

142
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:15,219
You have more fans than you realize. Say it with b-chat. Jerma Hart. And they say party party

143
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:28,519
party. That's awesome. That's amazing. What a perfect love story. Good shit. Thank you so

144
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,639
much for the five dollars. And I know it can be hard to catch every single stream. They

145
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:39,059
last a long time. So thanks for checking out the VODs and still hanging out. Being

146
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:51,000
part of the community. My first DM was an avatar and I never responded. No I just don't

147
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:04,340
even open up my Twitter. I opened my Twitter once to before my streams. To just say I'm

148
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:14,409
streaming. I don't ever write anything else. Kailer memeamoto thanks for the

149
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:21,659
three dollars here. They say Jerma loved your content ever since 2016. Don't know why but I

150
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,980
think your chat is too nice sometimes. It should be a little more mean to you.

151
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:44,340
Have you been here before? Are you sure you're in the right chat? It should be mean to me.

152
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:51,980
You know sometimes I've looked over here and saw like Jerma you suck. Fuck you.

153
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,260
It's happening right now. It's happening right now. It's happening right now.

154
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:08,329
Look over there and see it. But anyways. For real you've inspired me to make content of my own

155
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:14,389
and I'm blowing up on Instagram. The hellhole of all social media.

156
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,420
Earlier today I was talking to some girl on there and we met up at a local

157
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:39,699
you fucking had to do that. It was a walk-in. It was a walk-in open thing. But thank you

158
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:51,190
for three dollars. I appreciate it. Thank you lukewarm soda can for the two five

159
00:57:54,010 --> 00:58:06,500
ten five ten fifteen. I guess we got some uh this is when I looked over it was like four out of

160
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,849
four right. Let's see. All right lukewarm soda can thank you for 250. I've got a story for

161
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:16,329
you about a weird dream I had. No joke. There's no punch line. It'll be four messages long.

162
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:19,369
So I'm at a wrestling event and as luck would have it I'm sitting next to Jerma.

163
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:25,289
I try talking to him. He can't hear me so I get closer. He can't hear me so I get closer.

164
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:28,730
He still can't hear me so I get closer until I'm right up against his face.

165
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:33,690
I say something along the lines of hey Jeremy did you see WrestleMania last week. It was

166
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:45,929
awesome. Um two two people died and Vince I'm cut off. What? As Jerma looks me in the eyes

167
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:51,929
stone-faced and tells me in a snobby voice I moved past that in my life then he turns to look at

168
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:57,050
his phone and says on it looking bored for the entire wrestling match. There's a girl with him

169
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:04,739
who some stripper name like Candy. What the fuck is this dream? Who is super into the event.

170
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:10,300
She keeps trying to get Jerma to watch but he refuses to look and looks pissed. A guy

171
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:15,659
walks down like in a baseball stadium selling concessions and asks Jerma if he'd like

172
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:23,739
anything with a. Jerma just repeats do you want anything back to him in a mocking voice

173
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:31,000
and keeps saying what did you what did you day aggressively at the concessions a guy

174
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,719
being a huge asshole and mocking the guy. I wouldn't be surprised if dream Jerma kicked.

175
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,300
What the fuck is going on here? Why do people have such strange dreams about me?

176
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:53,940
I'm not like this. I woke up after the main wrestler who is some weak useless shithead

177
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,539
and then finally I gotta do this all again. I need to know what the hell is going on here.

178
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:06,679
Talking about somebody's like head being exploded. I don't know anything about wrestling.

179
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,760
I've never even watched your streams for a few months because I've been busy at university.

180
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:19,510
I don't have the time to sit down and watch streams. What does my dream mean? I have no

181
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:31,300
idea. I have no idea what that means. I think that means that you just somehow put me into a

182
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:38,070
strange happenstance. I don't know why people have these weird dreams about me. This is like

183
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:45,099
number five in the last like two or three months but I appreciate it. Thank you for the

184
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:55,860
10 bucks here. Listen to Kiwo. Can we watch this? Yeah sure. What is this?

185
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:14,300
Hold on I gotta I gotta change my audio back to not the VR headset. Yeah super loud warning.

186
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:22,570
If this is this Titanic thing. Yeah lower the volume. This shit is loud. It's gonna hurt your

187
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:36,219
ears. I'm not kidding. Don't fuck around here. Okay let's go and watch this. I actually I

188
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:44,360
didn't get to really see this whole thing. Make it louder. All right let's look at it.

189
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,929
I've never watched this whole movie so I don't know exactly how the scene went down.

190
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:21,480
Oh it's beautiful Jack. It sure is.

191
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:34,139
All right let me put you down. Oh it's beautiful I know. Just watch out. Watch out for the railing.

192
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:44,780
The explosion.

193
01:02:50,570 --> 01:03:02,139
The explosion when when the body lands. I was so fucking loud. Oh I probably killed somebody.

194
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:13,739
I'm so sorry. Imagine having that at full blast in a house with your TV on and speakers.

195
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:22,550
My goodness. But anyways let's uh move on to do the rest of the bits.

196
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:34,300
We had uh rain. Rage bow. Rage and bow. Thank you for the

197
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,179
bits here. The Titanic was so loud that my little sister came down to watch.

198
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:51,719
Sorry I said your name wrong. How would I mispronounce Tasty Turd? That's not possible.

199
01:03:51,719 --> 01:04:01,079
It's very easy to say. It's a disgusting name. Why would I mispronounce that? Tasty Turd?

200
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:04,679
I know and you baited me but that's fine. I don't I know I was baited.

201
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:11,219
I had to screw up. I had to get that cleared up. Thank you Dorkcube for the 250. Man listens to

202
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:16,820
Celine Dion and loud sounds of rending metal. Well helping you with the rowing machine. The

203
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:27,210
sequel to man listening to loud farts and screams helps you lift weights. Oh VR is

204
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:37,239
fucking hilarious. It really is so much fun. Thank you Tom. Tom Cream for the five dollars

205
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:43,800
and one cent. No message just five bucks. Thank you Tom. Disinterest thanks for the five dollars.

206
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,719
Remember the Titanic chaos was the hardest I've laughed so far this year. Here's a few bits

207
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:59,940
as thanks. I'm glad you thought it was funny. It was fun to do so glad you liked it. Uh

208
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:06,599
Schwartzerade thanks for the five dollars. Screw that guy posting fan fiction. Smiley face.

209
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:14,099
What do you mean fan fiction? Thank you the five dollars though.

210
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:18,019
Oh did I just turn the stream off? No okay I just elbowed the I thought I just turned off the

211
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:24,059
stream. Thank you Lazy Luke for the three dollars twenty three cents. Last stream you talked a bit

212
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:27,929
about how you wanted that YouTube archive to keep the chat because people wanted to keep the

213
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:34,250
chat's reaction to the drunk VR stream. Disregarding the quality of the archive chat

214
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,489
extension is it fine for me to make my own stream archive website that displays chat

215
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:42,889
next to the video and is pretty much the same as if you had highlighted all your streams

216
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:47,130
and if the answer is yes then what's the difference to you actually highlighting all your streams?

217
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:57,739
Um I think the dip yeah I don't think the highlights don't keep uh chat do they? Do

218
01:05:57,739 --> 01:06:03,539
highlights keep all of chat or is that only VODs? I don't think they do so that would be

219
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:20,329
the difference. Jeremy's too lazy to do that shit himself. No I mean they only keep chat

220
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:26,329
if the VOD still exists. Well yeah but I mean a VOD is deleted after 60 days so a highlight

221
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:49,110
of a VOD will always after 60 days not have chat. Okay so yeah but I think mostly that stream

222
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:59,159
archive channel on YouTube has everything there so I mean that's years of um highlights do keep

223
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:04,889
chat they do. I feel like it's like I'm going to be breaking it up into two places like if

224
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:10,739
you ever want to watch one of my VODs from a year ago you've got to go to another channel

225
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:14,739
you know what I mean? Oh but where do I watch that stream that you did? Oh we'll go to this

226
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:19,460
YouTube channel. What about this one? Oh it's here you know they're kind of in the same spot

227
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:27,369
so it's a little cleaner but if that if I can keep chat I really might have to just start

228
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:47,420
highlighting everything. It's probably time. Do I have the sorcery chat logs? No I do not.

229
01:07:48,300 --> 01:08:01,820
Those that was years ago a long time ago. Well because remember that like three four

230
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:07,500
years ago I never I didn't think I was gonna want to save the chat I was just barely

231
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:14,309
streaming full time like more than three or four times a week. I had just started I didn't really

232
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:28,500
know the ins and outs completely. I still don't but let me look into that for real not just

233
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,770
like as the meme on the channel because if I can just keep them all here with chat

234
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:42,659
it's probably worth starting to do. Let me actually in super quotes like look into that

235
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:51,109
but thank you Lazy Luke and also for your 250 also sorry my last sorry for my last

236
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:58,939
message. What's wrong with your last message? It's a good thing to bring up obviously. I know

237
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:05,899
that's cool man don't worry. It's never gonna happen. No don't say that. You don't know that.

238
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:16,630
Thank you bop beep for the three bucks. Some empty cans of booze might have something to

239
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:22,550
do with that. I posted the wrong link. Anyways this puke talk has reminded me of this great

240
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:32,140
clip. Is this somebody puking? Hold on let me screen this. Yeah this is this is this is

241
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:41,159
somebody puking. This is the this is Vince McMahon. I don't think I want to play this

242
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:51,979
but I want to play this line here. I'm not gonna play that though because that made people

243
01:09:51,979 --> 01:10:03,420
I don't think one have to see or hear that right now. Vince McMahon was fucking crazy.

244
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:20,819
Thank you though. Thank you to Jess you got it for the 250. Here we go guys Jess you got it.

245
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:30,470
Made lemon basil ice cream and they just tried it and we're gonna get a review. All right here's

246
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:36,779
the ice cream. It's really weird but I don't hate it. I think it's only as good as my ability

247
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:45,609
to make ice cream is. I'll probably make it again. That looks delicious. What's wrong with

248
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:57,909
that? It's good shit. It's good stuff. What you meant to say was my palette just was

249
01:10:57,909 --> 01:11:03,670
enlightened. I could see colors after after I took a bite of this. I could see colors on

250
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:07,590
the spectrum we can't see for 10 seconds and then I had to take another bite to get to see

251
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:20,409
it again. Looks good though. It's got a lemon zest. Come on. Oh that's not a good thing.

252
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,529
Yeah I just like describe. I feel like that's what happens if you drink mercury.

253
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:42,760
I can see the whole other spectrum and then you die. So don't do that. Anyway C4G thanks

254
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:50,260
for the five dollars. Adorama you handsome little lad. Fuck it up and go get them.

255
01:11:50,260 --> 01:12:00,859
And it's a bisexual pride. Handsome little lad. I'll take it. Thank you. Fuck it up and go get

256
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:13,140
them. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks for the five dollars. I missed community subs from

257
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:21,579
cure cure or cur. Thank you for the five community subs. I missed it an hour ago.

258
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:29,109
I was probably sprinting in place. So sorry I missed it. I also missed a 50 dollar donation.

259
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:37,689
What a bad streamer. Terrible streamer. Cat's beanie gave 5000 bits 50 bucks about an hour ago.

260
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:43,350
I'm not sure if you still here. I hope you are. You're the best fucking streamer. Also PS

261
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:47,989
be aware of your surroundings. I hit my wall playing my VR and snapped my controller in half.

262
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:55,430
Don't be like me. I I'm not even concerned about the controller as much as I am about

263
01:12:55,430 --> 01:13:02,069
my desk. There are two big dents in this. This is a nice desk. I just got this when I moved to

264
01:13:02,069 --> 01:13:07,909
Vegas. It's a beautiful walnut desk and I have smashed it as if I was hitting it with a hammer

265
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:13,590
like four times. There's at least two or three big big dents here. I fucked it all up. It's a

266
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:21,770
walnut desk and it cost a lot of money. It was at least at least like 180 bucks and at

267
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:25,210
most like five grand. It's somewhere in the middle. You'll figure it out.

268
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:39,720
It's not even close to five grand. I gave you a huge average potential.

269
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:48,680
It's not $5,000. I'm kidding. You think I'm I'm not gonna buy a $5,000 desk. I've ruined it.

270
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,630
Hey, Wince Ryan, thanks for three bucks. You may have been asked this already,

271
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,960
but are you planning on doing Labo VR? Reviews are saying it surprisingly does not

272
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:09,899
suck. Yes, I will. I will be doing Labo VR. Just not now. Probably in like a week or two.

273
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:19,420
I mean, if it's Labo, I have to do it. I'm gonna be the only streamer that's ever done all the

274
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:27,260
Labos. No one else can say that. Somebody might do one. I'm gonna do the car just the

275
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:31,979
car one. I'm talking one in the from the box. I'm the only goddamn person on this whole

276
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:40,500
website that did them all except for the submarine. Find me somebody else that can say

277
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:56,899
that. We're doing them all, but thank you. Uh, smelly boy, thanks for the $250. Can somebody

278
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:01,939
make an edit of Jerma killing people in Sword and Sorcery to Beware? The song Beware by

279
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:11,859
Death Grips. I'm sure somebody's capable of it, but thank you. Uh, Wild. Thank you Wild

280
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:20,779
Hike for the $245. Ah, I'm not supposed to be reading this, but you hit a growth spurt.

281
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:39,079
Room's not bigger. Shader! Thank you though. Pika Banana, thanks for the $5. Thank you Pika

282
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:42,600
Banana. I had to work today early in the morning and I've been pretty tired all day,

283
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,239
but then I saw you were online and watching your high-energy VR antics brightened me up.

284
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:55,899
You never fail to make me laugh, Jerma Hart. I appreciate that, thank you. I do burn myself

285
01:15:55,899 --> 01:16:04,539
out in these VR streams though. It's like a 50% faster drain. If I'm not doing VR,

286
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:19,989
streams are six to eight hours long. I get, it's like a 100% increase, sometimes longer. Yeah,

287
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:26,859
it's just, it's draining. You gotta find the right VR games. Yeah, I mean sometimes I can do

288
01:16:26,859 --> 01:16:30,140
it for a while. It's just when you get into room scaling, you start moving around and

289
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:34,220
like running around in place and crouching and standing up and moving. It's like you're doing

290
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,970
yoga for four hours. People don't even do yoga for like 40 minutes before they stop,

291
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:54,489
but I still love it though. It's a lot of fun. Jerma lied about Fruity Loops thanks to the $2.50.

292
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:59,050
If you aren't going to play Fruity Loops, then you should at least play Google Earth VR.

293
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:06,140
I'm gonna gotta play Fruity Loops, so don't worry. It'll look like a year. I don't know,

294
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:14,979
maybe. Let's get the credits rolling. Thank you everybody for your subs and thanks guys.

295
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:22,300
I mean when I get really tired, I do that. Okay guys, so let's have a look and

296
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,600
it's filler for my brain to make up a sentence or get a word out,

297
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,060
but let's get the credits rolling. Here come all the new subs and all the old subs and everybody.

298
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:57,380
Thank you for your support. Wait, when was Joel here? Did Joel show up at some point

299
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:10,550
that I missed it? Oh well, apparently I missed it. Was it gifted? Oh he's very sneaky, very

300
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:19,720
sneaky about that. No, he was one of the gifted subs. That's awesome. A few more bits have come

301
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:29,100
in here the last 10-15 minutes as we watch the credits roll. Maxi Kaspersky thanks for the

302
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:33,659
three dollars. I was listening to this in the background as I got some work done, but I had

303
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:38,300
to put it on the main screen after I heard the sound of your knuckles impacting on your walls.

304
01:18:38,859 --> 01:18:46,260
Great as always. And they say Kiwo stream hype. When's the Germa V Joel gamer challenge? We

305
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:53,220
actually talked about it. Joel is apparently very busy, so we might do something a little

306
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:58,100
different. We might come together and collaborate on something soon. He was busy

307
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:04,470
working on a lot of stuff, so we're going to come together and probably collab on something

308
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:19,020
special. So he admits you're the better gamer. Something like that. All that trash talk.

309
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:23,930
Now we've talked about it a couple times. He's out, he has a lot of projects that he's

310
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:33,609
working on right now, so we're gonna do something. When is it? I haven't, I'm not

311
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:41,029
sure. I have to get that information from him, but thank you. Thank you Freudian Weapon

312
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:43,829
for the floor at all. This VR looks like a hell of a workout. Kudos on playing it for

313
01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:50,100
so long. If that were me, I'd be done in 20 minutes. Yeah, I mean, it got close. I was

314
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,699
sitting there when I was doing in the chair VR and moving around and tilting my head around,

315
01:19:55,699 --> 01:20:01,479
but being completely still in the chair, I had only been streaming for like an hour and 40

316
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:06,840
minutes. I thought I had, I was, I almost had to stop. If I didn't stand up and just take

317
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,319
the headset off and move around for a little bit, I was gonna have to stop streaming.

318
01:20:10,279 --> 01:20:16,840
So thankfully I was able to go for longer, you know? But it is a workout, but it's a

319
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:31,659
lot of fun. And that juicy bit has an incredibly nice message. They say,

320
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:34,939
Jeremy, you're seriously the biggest inspiration in my life. You don't know it as we never have,

321
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:38,699
literally never spoken, but you've shaped me into the person I have become today.

322
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,819
You're hilarious, intelligent, handsome, and everything I strive to be.

323
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:46,300
I speak for myself and everyone here when I say that I love you and I wish you a long

324
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:52,840
and prosperous life and career. That's a shitload of incredibly fucking wonderful things

325
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,520
to hear. I'm honored and humbled. I can't believe that somebody would say something like

326
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:06,470
that. So thank you. I hope you can take something fun from the streams. I hope

327
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:15,960
if I do inspire somebody, I hope it's for good, you know? So thank you. I really appreciate

328
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:29,000
that. But that is my time. I am going to go take a bath, like the hottest bath I've ever

329
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:38,300
taken. I am not going to be live tomorrow and depending on a few factors, I'm going

330
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:46,060
to get in touch with Kiwo. Kiwo, if you're still here. Looking at possibly like Monday

331
01:21:46,060 --> 01:22:01,909
or Tuesday, right? Not going to be a lot. No, not going to be live tomorrow,

332
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:08,359
but we're going to figure it out. I'll get sus updated when I got, I'm making a mind show

333
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:15,380
clip. Wait, what do you mean? Please tell me you didn't see the mind show stuff that I was

334
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:21,859
doing at the end. I'm going to give you a key word here. Did you or did you not see

335
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:35,800
QRS? QRS. That is fucking embarrassing. Oh, I got to do it. I got to do it, right?

336
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:55,020
QRS. Every single one of them. Watch their fucking arms. I'm fucking insane. He's still

337
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:01,159
drunk. I want to do another mind show stream. I just had a bunch of technical problems with

338
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:08,359
it. I got like some kind of sinking issues. I got soft locked on the table. So I think

339
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:20,539
I'm just going to come back to it because it was a lot of fun, but I will see you guys

340
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:27,880
soon. Wait, Kim check. Oh no, Kim's not in there. Don't worry. Hopefully you've

341
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:36,939
enjoyed the VR recently, the last three streams here in a row. All right. I'm going

342
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:42,310
to leave you a mind show clip. You can respond for our collaboration. You mean like

343
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:47,270
right now on stream or you mean like in discord? If you got it, I'll watch it now.

344
01:23:48,069 --> 01:24:02,460
You got it now? No. Okay. Okay. Well send me that clip. I'm drunk off my ass. Hey,

345
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:14,810
well I was there like two days ago, three days ago. Drunk VR is worst VR or best VR,

346
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:22,300
depending on who you ask. I'll see you guys soon. I'll see, if not on Monday,

347
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,739
we'll see you Tuesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great rest of your weekend.

348
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:29,500
Thanks for watching as always. See you soon.
