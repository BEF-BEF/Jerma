1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:30,359
Okay, let's finish the thing. Make sure I can hear what's going on. Kind of can. Can you guys hear

2
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:48,009
this? You can, but you can't see it. Why? Oh, shit, there we go. Let me just redo this. Finishing the

3
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:56,219
thing. The game name is The Thing, obviously. All right, where was I going? Anybody remember what

4
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:15,269
the hell was going on in this game? Well, that's not correct. It'll be correct in a moment. Back

5
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:44,150
down to zero. Put this back down to zero. Should be good now. Okay. Hey, there you are. Now I should

6
00:01:44,150 --> 00:02:02,620
do this and then this. We're ready to go. All right, so the last thing we did, 459.12. This looks like

7
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:17,939
it, right? Is that correct? Is this correct? Right, because I have to, okay, so I go down

8
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,810
through, you just had, I had to run. Oh yeah, I remember I said this was going to be horrible.

9
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:31,180
Okay, well, all right, let me like remember how to play. All right, I was going to run. That was the

10
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:45,240
idea. What's going on? Because we're being, we're under attack right now. There's huge monsters in

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,300
the way and I was going to run by and go down because the elevator is there, right? Okay,

12
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,939
I remember. I think DPI got like reset somehow. All right, it's right here. Monster comes through

13
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:11,349
the door. Run, run around the circle. All right, all right. Money stream part two. No, no money

14
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:24,490
stream part two. Get me out. And then it's this way. Who did that? That was Gibbler. Gibbler just

15
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:37,750
gave 10,000 bits. They said money stream part two. No, and then they said LUL. Thank you for the 10,000

16
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,270
bits. Thank you for the extreme amount of money. Thank you. Cream, corn, wine. Should I just play

17
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,949
the thing every day? Should I just play the thing every single day? I think I figured out the meta.

18
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:57,610
It's just put on the thing for like an hour stream. Cream, corn, five community subs, potato

19
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:06,580
chief, 10 community subs. What the fuck? Here we go. Thank you guys, seriously. But now I,

20
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,740
okay, there's a monster that's over here. I'm going to burn him. Thank you, both of you.

21
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:21,129
Okay, don't want to fuck this up. Hey, you boy, 10 community subs. Gnarly, five community subs. What

22
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,410
the fuck? It's the, the thing just does it to everybody. Why is the thing doing this to you guys?

23
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:41,319
All right, I can't die here. This is like actually annoying and hard. Wizard, Ribbit, thank you for

24
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,360
the five community subs. Hey, thank you. Flissenberg, five community subs. Thanks, both of you.

25
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:58,889
Die. I could probably just run by you too. No, I can't because they spawn. All right, will you die?

26
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:14,389
Die. Burn. RoboLamp just gave five community subs. Come here. All right, for the love of God.

27
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:28,069
KpShit, thanks for the five subs. I said that name so incorrect. K, what'd I say? KpShit?

28
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,160
ClassicBanana, thanks for the five subs. Shardopus, thanks for the five subs.

29
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,040
Oh my God. But thankfully now I have healing. How much health do I have? Five health packs.

30
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:51,939
Don't fuck it up. Thank you guys, seriously. The thing money streams.

31
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,420
Niershue, another five community subs. RarePepeBodyLotion, thanks for the five community subs.

32
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:25,259
PixelMike, thanks for the five subs. Fuck. Did Niershue give another five subs right now?

33
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:37,939
Another money stream. EvilCrucifix5, I'm telling you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna test this theory.

34
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,300
In like, in like six months, I'm going to play the thing again. It's time for slime five community

35
00:06:46,300 --> 00:07:00,870
subs. Thank you, slime. Die. Come on. I need to get back to where I was. Pog. Not even a thank you

36
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,699
anymore. Just the number. No, that's not true. That's not true. I got cool on at least three

37
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:20,100
of those levels. No, thank you, seriously. All of you. FraudyWeapon5, you boy. Ten, thank you.

38
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:30,709
I thought you were dead. Holy shit, it's happening again. It's actually happening again.

39
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:37,220
All right, here we go. This, that guy's a bad guy though. That guy's a bad guy.

40
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:49,399
I don't care about that guy. I just want, I need you to stay here. We're just gonna make it to the

41
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:56,500
bottom. VGB200, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. I just gotta get to the,

42
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,860
fuck that guy. Remember that guy's a bad guy. Remember that, that's important. All right,

43
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,459
this is where I left off before. This is the tricky, stupid, dumb part that I hated.

44
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,740
I may have been a little tired. That's why I hated it. I remember now. Now I remember I hate this

45
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,259
because if you get sprayed with water, it takes off more health than getting shot by a gun.

46
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:24,439
Okay, that's why, that's why I remember. I remember this. He hates this. I do. Give me out my gun.

47
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:39,240
Watch the steam. Watch the steam. Okay, give me a different, I need something different

48
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,960
in my offhand. I need a fire extinguisher. Yeah, because I need to use it in a minute.

49
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,740
Thanks for the gift sub. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, whoever's given them, all of you.

50
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,750
Right, this part. Okay, now you do, you gotta do the, this part. It's a rocket launcher.

51
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,779
Jill Krungus, thanks with five subs. I think I can just shoot that shit. I can. All right, here we go.

52
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:14,549
I need a, do I need a flashlight for this part? Yep, put on the flashlight, Jeremy. Don't be an idiot.

53
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:21,029
This is the part where, yeah, I get swarmed by the little things.

54
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:31,940
Where is it? There's one more. There's one more. I don't want to back up into the steam. Where's the

55
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:40,500
last one? ChunkyBeloni10 community subs. Thank you, ChunkyBeloni. Thank you guys for the other, like,

56
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:50,549
guy sits down and receives huge sums of money. Thank you. Thank you for the money.

57
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:59,620
Thank you. Who was that? Who was that? Thank you for that money. Hey, number. Thank you for the money.

58
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:07,940
Five subs. Just forgot to give me, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Appreciate that.

59
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,580
Thanks for the, thanks for the 10 community subs and thank you for the $50. Also, thank you to

60
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:28,490
BigJunkus for that money you gave me. Who gave the money? Somebody gave $50. Who was it?

61
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,330
I don't, I need to know. I need to know. What am I? What am I without my fucking shout out money?

62
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:57,350
What am I? No, no, no, it stopped. It stopped. What do I do? Oh, hey guys,

63
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:08,440
playing the thing here. Oh, gnarly. Thanks for the nine community subs. Thank you. Appreciate that.

64
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:17,419
Thanks for the money. Nine more subs just came in. Tier one. Unbelievable. Gnarly62, you are a

65
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:29,269
fucking legend. Let me just tell you. Nice work. Here we go. Wait, it's behind me, right?

66
00:11:37,690 --> 00:12:01,720
What is this hip tracking? I only have two, I can't say the word. Magazine. That's right.

67
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:13,539
Magazine, magazine, magazine, magazine. That's got it right. That's got it right. Yep. Okay. Fire

68
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:24,860
extinguisher. I was already at like one health pack by this point. So that zombie guy is not

69
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:42,259
going to come down here, is he? I don't think so. Not that I remember. What the hell is this guy

70
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:54,379
doing? Not the behind me, right? I only have, okay, this is bad. I, is there any, okay, give me my

71
00:12:54,379 --> 00:13:06,919
rocket launcher. I don't understand what happened there. That didn't hit it. It hit the corner of

72
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,440
the, what did it do? What happened there? What happened there? What happened? I don't understand.

73
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:51,529
I'm so mad right now. This is sad. Yeah, I know. That was bullshit. That thing has a hitbox

74
00:13:51,529 --> 00:14:01,110
as big as the screen you're seeing right now. I'm almost there though. I have to wait because

75
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:09,429
this, this is what screwed me up last time. Shoot this. Wait. Okay. There are aliens that come out

76
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:27,909
from this guy's body, right? Did I kill it? Did I? No, I didn't. I remember this part. It has to die

77
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:35,000
on screen. Yes, I know. I get it. Just like every Game of Thrones character. If they don't die on

78
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:54,259
screen, then they didn't fucking die. That was good, right? How am I going to do this? Remember

79
00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:12,070
this happened last time? What do I, I can't, I don't know why it's not dead. This is, this is,

80
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,350
this is the worst thing. This is one of the top five worst things that have been done in the video

81
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:36,629
game. I can't, I, what am I supposed to do? I soft-locked myself because I shot the barrels

82
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,429
before, but if I came over here to get it in my view, I would have gotten blown up by this barrel

83
00:15:41,429 --> 00:16:04,200
because I would have to stand right here and they did. What the fuck? What the fuck?

84
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:36,139
Shoot the, why does it not fire? Dude, this gun is, doesn't make any fucking sense.

85
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:55,299
You gotta be kidding me. I can't even go around him. This is the stupid, this is the stupidest

86
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:04,009
thing I've ever done. By the way, the shotgun shoots 8% of the time that you click the button.

87
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:24,710
Like when I click to shoot the shotgun, it happens every 10th click. I am fucking around with this,

88
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:37,000
this dumb ass shit. I'll tell you. Not, not on a hard. All right. I want to do a test here. Ready?

89
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,250
Shotgun. It works now. So when I'm clicking, doing this, you know, an actual fight,

90
00:17:49,130 --> 00:18:02,410
why does it not fire? Does it make any sense? So go back and watch the, like every time I've

91
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,980
used the shotgun in a fight and you hear, and it doesn't do anything, you'll, you will physically

92
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:41,849
hear the clicking like this. It just happened. Now, now it just shot like four times instantly.

93
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:50,490
That's why I can't, you can't use a shotgun. The shotgun sucks. All right. What, what big bits?

94
00:18:50,490 --> 00:19:03,099
Did I miss bits? Wipe your tears with money. I don't, I don't even, I don't see them on here.

95
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:08,009
It was 20,000. It was like 200 fucking dollars came in. Are you kidding me?

96
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:23,769
No, I'm getting baited. Why do I have to go all the way from, why can't you have a save point

97
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:42,789
anywhere in between here and there? You throw so much junk at that stairwell. Dude, I almost

98
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:47,339
want to go get like a hack to fucking save state the game. This is one of those fucking

99
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:59,220
stupid ass games that has like segments like this. Report and report. Don't report me.

100
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:15,319
It's a fake gamer. Get out of the fucking way. Oh, this guy's a stupid ass gamer. I went the wrong

101
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:36,859
way. So I'm not even gonna, how do I do this without wasting ammo and shit here? I thought

102
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:47,670
that was a rumor because there's this guy in here. So I'm going to, I guess I could just make the,

103
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:55,029
no, cause then you get spawned. I have to just kill this guy now. I actually missed 150 dollars.

104
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:11,690
Did I seriously? Come on up. All right, run. I'm so glad there's no stamina in this game.

105
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:32,579
Watch it. Stop, stop, stop, stop. He still doesn't know to shoot them and then burn them.

106
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:45,690
I thought that was only for like the humanoid ones. Is that all of them? It's hard to tell

107
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:53,720
because there's like, there's no feedback when you shoot anything. Bullets just kind of disappear

108
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,279
into enemies. It's not, there's barely any feedback. You only get feedback from this.

109
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:31,700
Is he still alive? What are you doing? Dead? Dead. Okay. All right, let's try this again.

110
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,210
This time when I get down to that part with the barrels, I'm not just going to shoot the barrels.

111
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:47,109
I'm going to wait till I can see it, but it's going to kill me. I don't know. Not jubated.

112
00:22:48,549 --> 00:23:15,500
All right, here we go. What? Who said that? What?

113
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:30,279
What? Can I go? Oh yeah, this part.

114
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:59,480
Shit. All right, give me, is it more? There's more. How? Okay. Give me a weapon.

115
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,700
I'll give you a weapon. We'll see if we can use you. Stop, stop moving. Get over here. Get over

116
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,940
here. Stop running up there. Don't be so stupid. Why are you going over there? Follow me over here.

117
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:34,180
Oh, I hate you. He just stands up there. Oh, it's getting hard. It's getting hard for me to not

118
00:24:37,339 --> 00:25:02,710
just pretend I beat the game. What? These guys just spawned and he is infected.

119
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:11,140
He's, he's infected immediately and I can't run away because I'm going to get sprayed.

120
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:21,880
No, I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle. Oh great. This is where it gets all

121
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:37,819
fucked up now. I actually remember shooting this guy in the head with a rifle. I mean,

122
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:41,259
it was like four or five days ago, but I remember, I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle

123
00:25:41,259 --> 00:26:19,269
when he was up there and he turned. This is so bad. Oh, it's tough for me to, cause they spawn

124
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,390
here and you can't, I can't go this way because of this and I can't go this way because of this.

125
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,990
So the fucking claw monsters just keep spawning here and jumping on your face. And if you burn

126
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:43,140
them, you burn yourself. Shittiest fucking long spiral hallway. Oh wait, what's that? What happened?

127
00:26:43,140 --> 00:27:21,019
I walked five feet. Did we spawn underneath my body? Can I walk now? Please. Where is it?

128
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:39,539
How the fuck am I going to kill the gigantic thing that takes up the whole hall? That shit

129
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:47,849
ain't going to happen. How am I going to do that? The guy that takes up the whole thing.

130
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,630
I got to run backwards and burn them, but I'm going to get burnt by the fucking steam.

131
00:27:53,109 --> 00:28:15,750
Okay. I'm not going to blow this up. Can I spawn that guy without,

132
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't know, I'm going to go very, very slowly. All right. This one, I remember this one. This

133
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:44,539
one was stupid too. So I have to do this up all the way up there without having it somehow hit

134
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:52,599
this one or this one. I don't, I don't, did you see what that grenade did? That grenade went

135
00:28:52,599 --> 00:29:41,240
like a pit man's suitcase over here. That doesn't make any sense.

136
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:16,779
He looks like the greedy runner. I just, I don't. Okay. So now what are you supposed to do here?

137
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:32,380
I don't even have any health packs left. I'm so fucked. Just the casino. I'm so fucked right

138
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:40,119
now. Like, I don't know what they even expect you to do here because if I stand over there,

139
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:46,279
it doesn't destroy it. If I stand over here, I die from this, but I have to, I don't get it.

140
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,279
Use a grenade and run. It's going to shoot at me and blow up the, it's going to blow this up.

141
00:30:52,279 --> 00:31:10,470
Sniper rifle doesn't work, but the sniper rifle doesn't do anything. Now I'm in trouble. What?

142
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,690
If I shoot the barrels here, I can't see that it's, this is just a rock and a hard place,

143
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:47,420
but I can't shoot them from over here because it doesn't blow up the gun. Don't reload the save.

144
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:55,289
Why not? That's not a new level. Is it an, is that, wait, is it a new, new game?

145
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:02,279
Save the medic. No, you can't save the medic. He's fake from the beginning. I'm going to prove it

146
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:12,779
right now. I'm going to shoot him in the head. The second I see him, the medic is pretending.

147
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:20,279
Yeah. Let me just see what happens if I do this too. If I die in there, can I just restart the

148
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:39,579
level? Uh, Bob boy, this one, hey, Bob boy, this one's for you. Thanks for the five community subs,

149
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:53,299
Bob boy. All right. So if I die in here, like if I just die right now, like let the, well,

150
00:32:53,299 --> 00:33:13,819
I restart level and start here. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to stun this guy just because I'm going

151
00:33:13,819 --> 00:34:01,779
to. Okay. Oh, that would, why did you take so long to do that? Okay. For the love of God, please.

152
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:19,500
Jax is online. He hates gifts. No, I don't hate gifts. I love gifts. Thank you for everybody for

153
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:35,210
the gifts. The current any percent speed run of this game is 40 minutes. That's, that's pretty

154
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:49,179
ridiculous. Okay. I got to just get in there now. I wonder how fucked up it is. Yeah. I wonder how

155
00:34:49,179 --> 00:35:08,460
many like actual like skips there are. Shoot. Let's go. I'm going to make sure you don't get

156
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:38,440
touched. Stay, stay, stay. Come here. You and me. Let's go. Did he get touched? He didn't. By the

157
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,480
way, that's just a dice roll. If he's going to get hit or not, because he can't kill three things

158
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,420
like that in five seconds. Follow me. Let's go. Yes, sir. Are you, are you going to do this thing?

159
00:35:47,980 --> 00:36:02,869
You can do the stupid thing. They're getting hit by the steam. Okay. Let's go. Follow me.

160
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,639
You turn right now. I'm going to be so pissed off. Wait, watch out.

161
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,199
Hold still and I'll fix you up. Oh my God. You're a medic. Please don't just turn and make this a

162
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:35,880
complete disaster. Please. He's going to fucking turn right when it matters. Save game. There is

163
00:36:35,880 --> 00:37:07,380
no quick save. I needed to test. Somebody said to test that to see if you can just give the body.

164
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:18,340
You got fucking kidding me. That was a joke. That was a, that was a joke. That is, I actually just

165
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:28,940
got joked on right there. Don't stand there like me. You got it. You got it. You got to kill that.

166
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,360
Kill it. What are you doing? Shoot it. Oh, come on. Are you fucking kidding? That's why he wasn't

167
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,719
shooting. No, he's, it's, it's not real. He's, this motherfucker is infected the whole time.

168
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:59,289
He just wasn't even shooting the gun. The medic is scripted. I knew it. I, oh my God, I hate this so

169
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:05,780
much more than anything. You know, like the, like, like all bald because mad, whatever the fuck that

170
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:34,230
meme is. Oh, it's happening right now. You, you shot me with a shotgun from that far away and it

171
00:38:34,230 --> 00:39:37,900
did that much damage. Who are you? I hate this game. Okay. I got it, right? I got it. I got it. I had

172
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:46,550
to. I had to. You saw the explosion. I was even past it. Like I, this is just, why is this in the

173
00:39:46,550 --> 00:40:00,250
game? It's just there to be annoying. Dude, it even made the explosion on it. It even did the,

174
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,289
it exploded thing and it's still there. You have to be within like 10 feet for those things to be

175
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:23,400
destroyed. What on earth? What on earth would, what on earth? What were they thinking? Because

176
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,440
now I have to run forward and spawn all the enemies and then shoot a grenade and then get

177
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:45,269
swarmed. This has to be another way to do this. That has to be. Can I like bait the swarm?

178
00:41:15,019 --> 00:42:23,820
This is fucking dumb. I can't even aim down. This is dumb. D-U-M-M. Is this just never going to stop?

179
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,019
Because every time I run for it, the big guy is right there and then he blocks, you can't run by

180
00:42:29,019 --> 00:43:20,539
him. So I have to turn around. You can run. I can't. It's scripted. What kind of script is this?

181
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:29,059
Just run and gun with the SMG. Don't work. I tried it four days ago. Rare Pepe body lotion. Just

182
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:34,340
gave five. Thank you for the five subs. Rare Pepe body lotion. Appreciate it. And don't be that way.

183
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:44,150
Also gave five subs. Is there like a way just to exploit this part? Because this feels,

184
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,469
this feels like a weight. This feels like a thousand pound weight on my chest.

185
00:43:49,190 --> 00:44:25,739
I don't want to do this all again. How do you cheat? I would love to cheat right now.

186
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:53,820
Ask your older brother. I just don't have done it in a way. Max Games was a mistake. Thank you,

187
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:03,670
Max Games. I'm putting this on easy. I don't care. I'm putting this on the easiest difficulty.

188
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:10,550
I don't think I care about my ego taking a hit for not being able to go through this

189
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:19,659
fucking bullshit staircase and the thing. In fact, I don't even know what the hell this does.

190
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:40,460
This makes this, this is like auto aim, right? This is actually making it harder.

191
00:45:41,099 --> 00:46:08,119
This makes, this is worse. It's trying to aim at them and I'm so close to the end of this game.

192
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:40,179
I just want to beat it. It's trying. Heal me. I'm not using a mouth pack.

193
00:46:41,780 --> 00:47:26,250
What just happened to me? What happened to me? I just landed and got hurt. Remember this is all

194
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:46,739
canon. Oh, I would retroactively get rid of that. You coming out or what? What are you doing?

195
00:47:46,739 --> 00:48:15,110
This game is torturing Jeremy. I mean, it's, I was having fun. It was like eight and a half

196
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:35,139
hours of a fun game. And then this part is just stupid. It was, it was. This is Mario,

197
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:40,710
this is not Mario tennis levels. I haven't, I haven't like talked shit to somebody I don't

198
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:51,159
know online. Just watch a play through to figure it out. I shouldn't have to watch like the speed

199
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:57,239
run where the guy has played this game 4,000 times to be able to know how to play through once.

200
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:22,280
What? I shouldn't be able to do this to do it. All right, let's go. Let's do it again.

201
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,260
Now comes to some of the toughest fighting you'll do in the entire game. When you drop out of the

202
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,099
ductwork, Koman will run by or just behind you. He'll run all the way up to the top of the ramps.

203
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:35,739
When you hit the ground, quickly give him a weapon to follow him. Once you reach the top,

204
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:44,340
have him follow you and fight any troopers on the ramps. But that's, that's what I'm, I did that

205
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:51,690
already. But then I have to kill him and that sucks. I literally need him until he turns

206
00:49:52,409 --> 00:50:19,579
and it goes to shit. What are you fucking aiming at game? Auto aim in a tunnel.

207
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:34,599
Fuck. Get over here. Don't run by me. Shut up. Take a machine gun now. Let's go.

208
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:55,849
Follow me. Fight. Fight. Shoot. Heal the fuck out of me right now. Heal me.

209
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:06,139
Oh. Heal me. Heal me. You're a medic. Please. He's already turned. It's already over.

210
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:46,840
He just standing still like an asshole. Hurry up. Go. Help me please. Where are you?

211
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:23,130
Where are you? Get over here. Turn. Heal me please. I have no bullets.

212
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:47,400
Fight. Fight. Fight. What is even hurting you that much? What the fuck just happened?

213
00:52:48,440 --> 00:53:28,889
It all goes to shit here every time. He's dead. Good. Give me my gun back.

214
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:38,760
You have any health packs on you or anything? It doesn't stand up, right?

215
00:53:42,250 --> 00:54:00,309
Steam. I'm going to, I'm going back to the shotgun. Okay. Now it's this part. I get swarmed, right?

216
00:54:01,269 --> 00:55:03,219
No, it's the, these guys trying to beat this. I just got so mad at that person that beeped.

217
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:16,389
That was like a, the fuck did you say? What happened? That was a direct hit.

218
00:55:16,389 --> 00:55:33,590
Somebody fucking help me. Nobody help me. Nobody help me. Three hits needed. No, that's not true.

219
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:45,349
That's not true. That can't be true. No, you can't. That can't be true. If I don't do it here,

220
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:52,619
I'm watching a YouTube video. Okay. This is the part where it goes to shit every single fucking

221
00:55:52,619 --> 00:56:01,420
time. We're going to change. We're going to change that. I'm going to, okay. We're going to make a

222
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:11,849
wall of fire right here. I'm going to, I don't know what I'm going to do. I get, I run. No,

223
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:19,719
I don't have any idea. Should I watch a video? Yeah. Timed that so well. It's like, it's,

224
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,320
the hit box is so big and it doesn't stop. I did, I didn't do anything wrong there.

225
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:46,460
I'm watching a video. What's this called? Uh, the thing, stupid staircase, the thing staircase.

226
00:56:47,820 --> 00:57:03,610
What would he call it? Winding staircase. Uh, the thing staircase game spiral, the thing spiral

227
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:22,309
staircase. Somebody already has a video. It's a ramp. Okay. The Sims four is I'm getting the

228
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:31,159
Sims four open chat that what a brilliant fucking mind you have. Seriously. I'm like, I can't alt

229
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:36,199
tab. What a brilliant mind. I'm going to open up the chat, but I'm going to be logged in twice.

230
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:50,389
Am I going to get like, you've been hacked? Can I do this? Okay. All right. Let me see it.

231
00:57:50,389 --> 00:58:07,750
Can I even open this? Okay. I'm opening it. Let me just take a look. The thing any percent. No,

232
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:12,659
I don't want the speed run. I don't want the speed run. I don't even know what to look.

233
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:41,780
Okay. Hold on. I'm looking, did you just hear that sigh? Okay. So he shoots, he just shoots

234
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:48,789
everything and then he, and then he gets angry. And this is a speed runner by the way. See

235
00:58:49,590 --> 00:59:00,260
Oh shit. I'm shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting,

236
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:10,469
stealing. No, I'm just trying to see what to do from an expert. Wait, what's he aiming at?

237
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:21,380
Are he runs by? All right. What do you do here? You can shoot them. You can shoot them. You can

238
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:29,099
shoot them. You can shoot them, but there's no feedback that that's possible. Are you kidding me?

239
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:47,139
Don't even say that. Don't tell me this is real. I shot that with the hunting rifle like 10 fucking

240
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:52,500
times. There's no spark. There's no feedback. Your bullets disappear into the wall just like

241
00:59:52,500 --> 01:00:06,099
they do over here. This feedback here. Unbelievable. Okay. I'm going to go bait the fucking big guy.

242
01:00:06,099 --> 01:01:09,590
Let's go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Stop steaming. Yes. Yes. All right. Fucking hold on.

243
01:01:15,510 --> 01:02:04,420

244
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:16,969

245
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:41,619
Is it dead? Is it dead? I'm going to pass out. I think I'm having a heart attack. Okay. I think

246
01:02:41,619 --> 01:02:56,420
I'm fine. This is a small heart attack. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my

477
01:58:49,560 --> 01:59:01,210
give you more than that take more ammo you should be good what is this is it

478
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:05,109
like a grenade launcher or something that's a microscope I thought this was

479
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:08,029
a scope I thought it was a fucking attachment I didn't think it was a

480
01:59:08,029 --> 01:59:18,619
microscope whatever okay and how do we get these doors open that's fun what a

496
02:02:49,510 --> 02:03:07,880

507
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:45,800
room but every time I switch okay let's try this what are you doing that's done

508
02:06:45,800 --> 02:07:02,500
I have a girl fucking ridiculous and I love it automatically puts me it

509
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:10,569

02:07:10,569 --> 02:07:19,729
runner do because this is fucking ridiculous I just like rage opened my

511
02:07:19,729 --> 02:07:35,239
phone and this is the first thing that I see I know I don't I can't even do it

512
02:07:35,239 --> 02:07:47,100
is there a stand underneath him someone said stand next to it go just give me

513
02:07:47,100 --> 02:08:04,590
the broken thing to do third boss fight which is a giant tentacle I'm saying

514
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:07,789
there's it's seemingly no safe place for you to hide without getting hit by the

515
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:10,670
boss forcing to keep moving around dodges there's actually a very easy way

516
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:15,909
to prevent this how we stand literally so you know so you have to stand

517
02:08:15,909 --> 02:08:34,640
literally right underneath them is the only way I just want everyone to be

518
02:08:34,640 --> 02:09:03,590
aware of this this is what we like to call I can't what he won't even say it's

519
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:46,649
a bad program good point don't swing at me watch this can't reach so now light

525
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:15,619
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what

526
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:19,140
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what

527
02:11:19,899 --> 02:11:52,539
for a lady thanks for the 10 community fucking subs thank you thank you

528
02:11:52,539 --> 02:12:12,449
seriously okay stop so so I'm not gonna move when it says escape I don't even

529
02:12:12,449 --> 02:12:36,029
want him coming out of there use the shotgun only how many clips should

530
02:12:36,029 --> 02:13:10,159
it be I know it's a slug it's a slug I know one more

531
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:42,920
break them why won't you this is ridiculous and I have the same amount of

532
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:55,640
fucking health help help me help me help me help me he's on my team I'd say dude

533
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:58,399
the thing just spins around in a circle and you're gonna get killed every time

534
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:03,479
the thing you light it on fire and it just goes in a blender in a circle is

535
02:14:03,479 --> 02:14:07,399
there a reason why they decided to make every boss fight in a tiny fucking room

536
02:14:07,399 --> 02:14:13,920
why are we in this small room together why do we have to be in this in every

537
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:21,710
boss fight has to be a fucking shoebox it's maddening it doesn't make any

538
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:33,210
fucking sense why do we have to be in such a small area don't don't light them

539
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:39,020
on fire well I have to that's the only way I can progress I can't progress any

540
02:14:39,020 --> 02:14:47,729
other way just use normal weapons I did I was almost a 12 slug magazines on this

541
02:14:47,729 --> 02:14:54,630
motherfucker how many do you want how many slug

542
02:14:54,630 --> 02:15:06,439
magazines you want me to do use all why is it why are you doing this why are

543
02:15:06,439 --> 02:15:24,140
you doing this health-based or time-based um I guess I could just sit

544
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:46,720
here kill the other dude first I mean I can't I can't move though I fucking

545
02:15:46,720 --> 02:16:09,699
can't move if I move I'm gonna get hit I think it's stupid why do you pick the

546
02:16:09,699 --> 02:16:15,579
stun gun every single fucking time when I'm just trying to cycle why do you

547
02:16:15,579 --> 02:16:28,840
have to do that it's a bad idea that's a really bad idea because now I have to I

548

facts now if this is on easy do not use fire what if I run out of bullets I have

550
02:17:17,659 --> 02:17:30,200
to finish it with fire so I'm so fucked how do I do because when I light them on

551
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:39,940

552
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:43,500

get hit by the grenade oh my god this shit mmm my goodness it's fucking

555
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:34,200
ridiculous when you enter the room run along the middle seam of the floor to

556
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:37,860
the junction to the fourth or fifth row of tiles deep into the room you'll be

557
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:40,940
in an excellent spot from the boss because it can't hit you shot and till

558
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:50,750
you damage it to red shoot imagine just fighting a boss imagine just fighting a

559
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:55,889
fucking boss what was that again go to the fourth tile in the room and take two

560
02:18:55,889 --> 02:19:11,000
steps to the right what was the middle seam go through the middle seam of the

561
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:24,280
room and then then what the hell happened use flame grenade and run away

562
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:33,870
this boss can only be killed by fire but can be damaged middle seam of the floor

563
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:38,790
to the junction of the fourth or fifth row of tiles you'll be in an

564
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:43,469
excellent spot from the boss because it can't hit you so the fourth or fifth row

565

03:43:55,000 --> 03:44:13,030
five or six hours was like a four now do it on hard I did do it on hard absolute quality

829
03:44:15,209 --> 03:44:21,850
now play the outer worlds uh so here's let me wait I gotta talk we gotta talk about a few things here

830
03:44:23,049 --> 03:44:32,340
so as of the oh man this is I'm gonna sit down for this one so all personalities voices are

831
03:44:32,340 --> 03:44:45,620
impersonated okay uh so I the Halloween stream is gonna be on the 31st it's gonna be fairly

832
03:44:45,620 --> 03:44:53,479
elaborate if you have anything that you like to suggest right that you for secret slime actions

833
03:44:54,340 --> 03:45:00,420
that channel is going to be closed on the 28th there's not going to be any more time to do it

834
03:45:00,420 --> 03:45:05,620
because after 28th I need to compile with the people that are helping me produce this whole

835
03:45:05,620 --> 03:45:14,260
thing all the actions and get them into a template for the stream and I can't see them I cannot be

836
03:45:14,260 --> 03:45:20,979
looking at them how do we pick and we vote for them you don't I just want a shitload to pull from

837
03:45:20,979 --> 03:45:27,659
so then there's a ton of options how many per round that is to be determined probably probably

838
03:45:27,659 --> 03:45:34,760
we'll do like one or two per round until we get later on to a point where there's like some upwards

839
03:45:34,760 --> 03:45:42,280
of like five to ten going on at the same time so this also means because this was kind of short

840
03:45:42,360 --> 03:45:46,600
notice and the production team that did the carnival was doing is helping me do this too

841
03:45:46,600 --> 03:45:54,120
they're doing they're doing all the production stuff it was too soon to do this in Vegas so

842
03:45:54,760 --> 03:46:02,149
I'm going back to the east coast as of the this coming week here so I'm going back to the east

843
03:46:02,149 --> 03:46:08,469
coast and I'm going to kind of do a two birds at one stone scenario where I go visit my family

844
03:46:11,479 --> 03:46:15,399
so I'm going to visit my family because I haven't seen a lot of them in a long time some of my family

845
03:46:15,399 --> 03:46:21,159
I haven't seen some of my family members and some of my friends in just over a year so I was in

846
03:46:21,799 --> 03:46:27,319
Boston like three or four I think four months ago whatever it was maybe for a day or two

847
03:46:27,319 --> 03:46:31,319
trying to remember when the exact day was but I really only had like one or two days there

848
03:46:32,469 --> 03:46:38,870
so I'm going to go down there do the stream so I won't be around next week go down there do the

849
03:46:38,870 --> 03:46:49,590
stream and then I'm going to stay for a few days and then come back so take a hot air balloon back

850
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:54,549
it takes too long I'm going to hide this tape when I'm finished if none of us make it at least

851
03:46:54,549 --> 03:47:05,479
there'll be some kind of a record but yeah that's so I'm not the the Halloween stream is not going

852
03:47:05,479 --> 03:47:10,280
to be here not going to be in Vegas I'm going to be traveling for it and that's pretty much all I

853
03:47:10,280 --> 03:47:17,239
wanted to say also another important thing to remember is I still have

854
03:47:18,200 --> 03:47:21,239
the shooter blade and shooter blade 2 in fact they're right here

855
03:47:23,100 --> 03:47:33,110
that is something that I want to do probably I kind of I don't know if I want to start that's

856
03:47:33,110 --> 03:47:36,870
the thing about starting something like the Outer Worlds I know I have to play the Outer Worlds

857
03:47:36,870 --> 03:47:45,940
because it's Fallout New Vegas just again but different I want to play it but before starting

858
03:47:45,940 --> 03:47:54,409
the Outer Worlds I think I'm going to wait till I get back from the Halloween stream because I

859
03:47:54,409 --> 03:47:58,809
don't want to just play it for like one day and then disappear for three days do the Halloween

860
03:47:58,809 --> 03:48:07,500
stream and then come back three days later so we'll do tomorrow we'll do the shooter blade and

861
03:48:07,500 --> 03:48:12,520
shooter blade 2 because they're classic uh they're classic video games and might as well

862
03:48:12,520 --> 03:48:17,639
get rid of the rest of the ps1 stuff that's here and we'll see how that takes us see how we go

863
03:48:17,639 --> 03:48:24,409
from there sire I also have siren that's another one shit that's right I gotta do that before

864
03:48:24,409 --> 03:48:30,600
Halloween I don't shooter blade and shooter blade 2 won't take that long oh fuck siren's like a 30

865
03:48:30,600 --> 03:48:41,750
hour game whatever fucking happy Halloween Thanksgiving whatever shit this I mean I've

866
03:48:41,750 --> 03:48:46,950
applied like four times all right and that is going to be the end of this stream but it's not

867
03:48:46,950 --> 03:48:50,469
because we're going to go back uh this is going to turn into a just a chill

868
03:48:51,670 --> 03:48:55,510
session we're going to do the bits that I missed from a couple days ago three four days ago

869
03:48:58,520 --> 03:49:04,600
uh let me just I'm gonna hide this tag when I'm finished if no stream is officially over as of

870
03:49:04,600 --> 03:50:24,100
right now so let's go over the bits that we missed and I will be right back see you guys in a minute

871
03:50:24,100 --> 03:50:41,180
all right we can get started here with the outro I can't even tell if this is still broken or not

872
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:50,629
because there's been such insane gifted subs I think this is from a few days ago but so because

873
03:50:50,629 --> 03:50:54,709
we're doing two streams worth of bits and one of the that last this last stream was nine and a half

874
03:50:54,709 --> 03:51:00,950
hours so we're going to try to go through these at a decent pace and I always say that all the time

875
03:51:02,069 --> 03:51:11,190
but it has to happen now because it has to two hours later no no no no no no what's happening

876
03:51:11,190 --> 03:51:17,319
909 see you in like see you in like 35 minutes all right how about that how's that sound anyways

877
03:51:17,319 --> 03:51:22,360
this is from a few days ago I didn't do these I missed them I had to go I streamed for too long

878
03:51:22,360 --> 03:51:28,120
and my stomach was all fucked up so here we are now uh we had 250 bits from Peaceful Haley they

879
03:51:28,120 --> 03:51:31,879
said hey Jeremy how you doing hope all was well just wanted to ask if you're planning on going

880
03:51:31,879 --> 03:51:41,319
to Galaxy's Edge at Disney uh probably not anytime soon I know many people are very happy

881
03:51:41,319 --> 03:51:45,879
with it right now but I hope for the last one anyways have a good stream talking about building

882
03:51:45,879 --> 03:51:52,139
a lightsaber oh shit you can build you can build a lightsaber there like a real one well it's not

883
03:51:52,139 --> 03:52:06,680
real but is it though those things are shit what uh probably not I don't have any plans in the

884
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:12,520
immediate future to go to Galaxy's Edge I kind of want to wait until nobody cares anymore

885
03:52:13,079 --> 03:52:17,319
and then just get to go on all the rides and just get to eat all the food and not have to

886
03:52:17,319 --> 03:52:25,909
wait in line for anything so I don't know if I go like somewhere 2020 but yeah I am interested

887
03:52:27,530 --> 03:52:32,069
all two of the rides oh yeah there's only two rides but there's aren't they good though

888
03:52:36,809 --> 03:52:43,379
Galaxy's Edge is already empty oh well maybe I'll go soon I don't know

892
03:53:04,260 --> 03:53:07,459
cents they say adding to my previous message it's okay that the past few streams have been a little

893
03:53:07,459 --> 03:53:12,420
bit shorter I understand how tough it can be for streaming for eight hours while on thermonuclear

894
03:53:12,420 --> 03:53:32,870
laxatives yes this is true but I am not on them anymore I'm on another medication still though

895
03:53:33,430 --> 03:53:40,299
and it's really it's just fucking me up but not to the point where I have to stream for like two

896
03:53:40,299 --> 03:53:46,360
or three hours and then leave that only happened one time though there was only two streams all

897
03:53:46,360 --> 03:53:52,840
of last week or all the last two weeks that were like three to five hours long so it worked out

902
03:54:18,500 --> 03:54:24,020
1982 film The Thing he also used unused music from the original score of The Thing and of course

04:05:43,260 --> 04:05:50,180
is just stressful and horrible but thank you for the thousand bits appreciate it Freudian weapon

982
04:08:13,059 --> 04:08:17,940
you should avoid or what the doctor said I'm not doing it anymore because it didn't really do

983
04:08:17,940 --> 04:08:23,860
anything for me I was on it for a few weeks and it just wasn't changing anything and then I

984
04:08:24,659 --> 04:08:30,100
I had a colonoscopy and you know a few months ago and well there was these things in there that we

985
04:08:30,100 --> 04:08:34,420
wanted that maybe you should try this and maybe you should try this and maybe you should try this

986
04:08:34,420 --> 04:08:43,639
and then now I have another um I have another endoscopy I have to do instead of going up they're

987
04:08:43,639 --> 04:08:48,860
going down so they're gonna see if something's going on inside my stomach I don't know it's

988
04:08:48,860 --> 04:08:56,860
been why it's been a very strange uh eight months we'll say that I am just not fucking around I'm

989
04:08:56,860 --> 04:09:04,860
gonna try to see what the hell is wrong with me because it may not even be my stomach it I don't

1007
04:11:39,690 --> 04:11:46,329
my mom let me let me put 1950s version my mom let me watch one day I asked my amazing distant

1008
04:11:46,329 --> 04:11:52,219
dad to watch film again and he showed me the 80s version without any question or doubt in his mind

1009
04:11:52,219 --> 04:11:56,629
and this was when I was around 10 years old life was never the same afterwards for better or worse

1010
04:11:56,629 --> 04:12:08,010
I don't know but I have a thing for gore fests did they actually do a thing from like the 50s

1011
04:12:08,010 --> 04:12:17,430
I don't remember that it's weird thank you sticks renegade for the 275 I remember getting this game

1012
04:12:17,430 --> 04:12:23,930
back when Benny's used to be around it was $12 I bought it at least 12 years ago it was scary and

1013
04:12:23,930 --> 04:12:29,379
so hard for me I could not beat it at all and had to use cheats I don't know how you like it since

1017
04:12:55,190 --> 04:12:59,690
crop everything but the face cam and have it on mute the downside is you'll look like a crackhead

1018
04:12:59,690 --> 04:13:03,850
screaming for no reason so if you can look like a meth head screaming for no reason that would

1019

1124
04:29:16,760 --> 04:29:22,200
you know that you were my gateway drug to watching pro pro wrestling this is from gleam for 250 bits

1125
04:29:22,840 --> 04:29:27,719
I always love the rumbles and after re-watching them with my sister uh apple shift I decided to

1126
04:29:27,719 --> 04:29:34,440
give real wwe a shot I started watching raw and immediately fell in love it's so fucking fun at

1127
04:29:34,440 --> 04:29:39,159
first I thought that the fact that it was all scripted makes it stupid but in reality it makes

1128
04:29:39,159 --> 04:29:44,040
it even more fun it's like theater with punching thank you so much for introducing this to me

1129
04:29:45,299 --> 04:29:55,190
everyone's gonna call me a boomer but you can watch all the old shit on youtube I think all

1130
04:29:55,190 --> 04:30:03,479
the attitude era stuff with stone cold the rock the undertaker cain that you want to watch that

1131
04:30:03,479 --> 04:30:11,670
mankind getting thrown off the goddamn roof they don't do shit like that anymore mankind

1132
04:30:11,670 --> 04:30:20,540
got thrown off the roof of the cage actually they really did it and it almost fucking killed

1133
04:30:20,540 --> 04:30:29,370
them yeah it was it was unbelievable that guy would uh what's if I could why can't I think

1134
04:30:29,370 --> 04:30:36,760
of his name Mick Foley it was ridiculous he just didn't give us he just didn't give

1135
04:30:38,969 --> 04:30:53,799
that guy was just legendary at doing crazy shit in that ring I think they've dialed it down

1136
04:30:54,790 --> 04:31:12,809
in the last 10 years or so but I don't know I've only seen a few things recently is there's a new

1137
04:31:12,809 --> 04:31:21,579
wrestling thing in town though isn't there that AEW isn't that the new hot thing right now is

1138
04:31:21,579 --> 04:31:26,299
AEW is like really starting to get people to come over and it's better than the wwe because the

1139
04:31:26,299 --> 04:31:34,180
wwe is like not as good anymore now speaking of wwe things that aren't good anymore can you believe

1140
04:31:34,180 --> 04:31:47,770
they even released 2k20 wwe I am so happy that we will probably never get a fucking wwe 2k game

1141
04:31:47,770 --> 04:31:56,149
ever again I hope not oh god I pray every single day yukes decided they were like no this is like

1142
04:31:56,149 --> 04:32:04,229
boring and sucks in his wicked shitty every year and they left so please everyone put your hands

1143
04:32:04,229 --> 04:32:11,030
together and pray that this the thing that yukes comes up with is like it used to be back in like

1144
04:32:11,030 --> 04:32:20,149
2013 2012 am I going to use 2k20 for the next drama rumble probably not because it's fucking

1145
04:32:20,149 --> 04:32:28,940
terrible I mean like bugs are funny but when they get like when the game can't even function if I

1146
04:32:28,940 --> 04:32:34,299
spend like two weeks or like a full week making wrestlers in that game and we can't get a rumble

1147
04:32:34,299 --> 04:32:50,069
to even work I'm not even sure that's worth doing and that shit's 60 bucks yuke isn't on the series

1148
04:32:50,069 --> 04:32:56,979
anymore no because they went to do their own thing they do make it funny though maybe I don't know

1149
04:32:56,979 --> 04:33:08,599
I'll I'll check it out but I don't know do 2k14 again I can't I would I just can't it's on the

1150
04:33:08,599 --> 04:33:16,759
PlayStation 3 and it's the last one that it was the last 2k game that was on the PlayStation 3

1151
04:33:16,759 --> 04:33:23,540
and it just chugs it doesn't it really is not supposed to even be on there it was the final

1152
04:33:23,540 --> 04:33:31,819
one that they stuffed as much bullshit into and it's just it it takes like 60 seconds to load hair

1153
04:33:32,380 --> 04:33:42,970
in that goddamn game if you have too many layers on a character I would but it was too it's too

1154
04:33:42,970 --> 04:33:54,979
painful to try to put to make a character anymore it's the effort that is respected plus I don't

1155
04:33:54,979 --> 04:34:02,419
have any of the old wrestlers anymore I mean I made like 60 people in the old 2k14 2k13 games

1156
04:34:02,419 --> 04:34:13,000
can you get it on ps4 I wish unless it's emulated but emulating a ps3 half of the games don't even

1157
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:22,779
work more than that more than half actually I think I don't know I'll let me I'll see what

1158
04:34:22,779 --> 04:34:28,020
I'm gonna do but I'm glad you got into wrestling it's a really fun sport to watch

04:47:06,840 --> 04:47:14,200
bread if you never sub to this channel ever and you never give even a cent to this channel sorry

1237
04:47:14,200 --> 04:47:20,919
that's fine that's oh are you having do you are you having fun do you like watching the streams

1238
04:47:21,720 --> 04:47:28,409
do you have fun here good fuck it you don't have to you don't have to give this channel money

1239
04:47:37,159 --> 04:47:48,040
I think people understand that I hope they really do I'm not having fun you said you hate cars and

1240
04:47:48,040 --> 04:47:58,150
that's my favorite movie I like that one does it make us a monster if we never sub

1241
04:47:58,869 --> 04:48:08,360
why would that ever have why would I ever think that that why would I ever be like well you know

1242
04:48:08,360 --> 04:48:18,380
I mean you should sub no if you if you can't afford it if you can't afford to pay this stream

1243
04:48:18,380 --> 04:48:26,950
money then then don't just don't you still contribute to this stream even though if you

1244
04:48:26,950 --> 04:48:35,560
don't think so like think about it let's say I mean the streams have been the last

1245
04:48:36,279 --> 04:48:43,659
three or four months or so I mean there's been a lot of people here and even if you're not paying

1246
04:48:43,659 --> 04:48:50,299
money to the stream you're still contributing to the success of this stream does that make sense

1247
04:48:51,430 --> 04:48:54,229
so don't ever think somebody gifted you a sub

1248
04:48:59,450 --> 04:49:12,869
all right somebody gifted him a sub cool thank you I guess cool but anyways long story short

1249
04:49:12,869 --> 04:49:18,740
get off your fucking phone when you're driving a car don't do that and if you don't have the money

1250
04:49:18,740 --> 04:49:25,560
to pay this stream save it take care of yourself first take care of me somewhere somewhere like

1251
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:28,919
down the bottom like you know if you have if you have still cash lying around you're like you know

1252
04:49:29,080 --> 04:49:41,849
fine fuck it take care of yourself first always back to the moral of the story but we also we had

1253
04:49:41,849 --> 04:49:48,889
a ton of community subs this stream too a ton of them I it happened again for like about 10

1254
04:49:48,889 --> 04:49:55,750
straight minutes 15 straight minutes and I remember because I missed numb legs given a hundred dollars

1255
04:49:55,750 --> 04:50:05,700

05:07:52,810 --> 05:07:59,299
down your house here we go I had a dream of you of my own basically you came on stream one day

1376
05:07:59,299 --> 05:08:03,930
and announced you were making a movie that would premiere live on stream and everyone was so

1377
05:08:03,930 --> 05:08:10,330
excited okay I don't even know what the movie was about but you were like a train pirate and

1378
05:08:10,409 --> 05:08:15,849
you only spoke in old English and nobody in the movie liked you anyway it was so bad you lost

1379
05:08:15,849 --> 05:08:26,619
almost all your viewers in the span of an hour dude do you really fucking weird shitty dumb content

1380
05:08:26,619 --> 05:08:38,939
seems to increase viewers on twitch not decrease them I sat here with a vacuum cleaner going for

1381
05:08:38,939 --> 05:08:44,540
five straight minutes with no other sounds and I full screen cammed my face sitting there with no

1382
05:08:44,540 --> 05:08:55,819
emotion and the stream went up by like four or five hundred viewers maybe it was boring people

1383
05:08:55,819 --> 05:09:07,860
don't people like bad but they don't like boring you know what's here you know what being boring
