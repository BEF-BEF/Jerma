00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:34,390
Hello. Let me quit this game. I need to change the title to Last Hero of Nostalgia.

2
00:00:34,390 --> 00:01:05,590
So I do nostalgia and then like comma bat chest. Is that good? Is that, is that, nah.

3
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:19,859
Last Hero of Nostalgia. How about, no, I don't want to encourage bat chests unless I say it.

4
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:31,620
How about nostalgia? Let's game. Whatever, I don't care. Nostalgia. Let's game. Who gives a shit.

5
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:55,049
That's arguably worse than the bat chest title. Okay, just give me two seconds. Yeah, sponsor's

6
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:26,659
over. I'm probably going to keep playing that game. That was really fun. All right. What was

7
00:02:26,659 --> 00:03:03,669
the last thing I did here? Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

8
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:29,860
There it is. There you go. You can have it for a little longer. Just for a little bit longer.

9
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:38,219
All right. Now I have to do the fun thing called it. The buttons are completely different in this

10
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:48,069
game. So it's not X, Y. It's R1, R2. This is going to mess me up. If I lose in the first 10 minutes,

11
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:57,800
it doesn't count. Yeah, you can take the timer off for the sponsor. Oh, I should probably take

12
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:07,620
up though. Let me do this real quick too. Hold on. Let me just take the panel out. Give me one

13
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:21,240
second. I'm glad I'm doing this now because the last time I did a sponsor, I believe, I wonder,

14
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,759
I think it was Gotham Knights. I left the panel there I think for like three weeks. It was kind

15
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:50,329
of ridiculous. All right. There we go. It should be good to go. Yep. Let's begin. Base came in the

16
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:59,589
bottom right. Probably a good idea. All right. Let's keep going. If you don't know what this

17
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:07,689
game is, this game is Last Hero Nostalgia. It's like a parody Dark Souls game. It's very good.

18
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:22,199
It's very good. Almost surprisingly so. We're all really into it. Watch this. All right. What

19
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:33,670
was the last thing? I was going to go up, right? There's like two ways to go. I forget where I was

20
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:48,459
going. And remember, I know it was literally yesterday, but you know what I mean? Like it's

21
00:05:49,019 --> 00:06:08,069
processing info can be difficult sometimes. Wasn't it? Was it a big theater room? I feel

22
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:25,100
like it's this way. I think this is right. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah. I got to get used to

23
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:33,129
the controls. I told you that one didn't count. I pressed it. I pressed X. That one doesn't count.

24
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,769
That one doesn't count. I have to read. I'm not throwing for content. I've got to learn.

25
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:56,250
It's R1, R2. You understand? Tell that to the judge. I'm documented here. I'm documented.

26
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:13,910
Okay. Let me just run around for a sec. I think it's this. Yep. Okay. This is where I want to go,

27
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:34,310
I think. Is it? I genuinely don't remember. No. Like in my brain right now is Wild Hearts. And

28
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,670
I'm like, oh, that area with the coral. It's like, this is a, this is a, this is, this game

29
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:50,980
is not in my brain right now. Like where the hell am I? Never happened to you guys when you just

30
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,060
play a game and you just like leave it and you leave it in a spot. You know, here's the problem.

31
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,930
I left it in a spot that wasn't like right at a boss door. So like I'm still in this area,

32
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:10,120
but I like to have no idea where I am. Anybody else happen to happen to you? Like if I was in

33
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:27,699
front of a boss door, it's like, oh, okay. Right. Here we are. Once I get it, I'll get it. So many

34
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:39,190
things to burn into memory because it's down here. I remember this because this is where the

35
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:49,820
wizard guy was. And then through here and then through here, I remember finding the pot head

36
00:08:49,820 --> 00:09:11,350
person. And I think that was where it ended. I think because then this leads, I don't know.

37
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:20,389
No, this guy, this goes back down to that other area. What about over here? I don't think I've

38
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:44,710
gone. No, I have not gone this way. All right. Perfect. Let's go. Welcome to the stream. Oh,

39
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:55,340
this is, this really is like the whole game is connected. Okay. So now I can be here. Any

40
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:08,500
memories? All right. So that's a shortcut to get back here. I swear to God, there was a place I

41
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:43,909
could go up. Stivity row. There's a boss here and I need help in there. Like, should I go up all the

42
00:10:43,909 --> 00:11:00,730
way? Cause that's the, let me go up. You look mad. No, it's a little confused. I don't want to say

43
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:17,210
I'm angry. I just don't remember this one door that I, I remember I walked by it like five times

44
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:53,909
before here. No, does anybody like remember? No, no. Top of the tower. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

45
00:11:53,909 --> 00:12:01,080
It's here. It's right here. It's right here. All right. So I go down here. Yep. I got it.

46
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:09,830
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Cause then I go down here and I can walk

47
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:27,139
up another side. Don't even please. I'll never get back here again. Please do not kill me.

48
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:41,220
All right. Here it is. Right. And then it was right out the fucking door. All right. Everybody

49
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:50,169
relax. Everybody just chill. It was literally right next to us. It was right next to us the

50
00:12:50,169 --> 00:13:00,899
whole time. I come, I forgot I opened this door. Everybody just chill out. Everything's good.

51
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:17,259
Now we just sit down. I'm doing a luck build. If you didn't know. All right. There we go. Right,

52
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:36,539
right, right, right. And then this goes down here. We don't touch this. We come out this way.

53
00:13:39,779 --> 00:14:04,360
And we look over here and then we turn around and we go back down and then we go up and then

54
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:31,110
we go up. No, I didn't press it again. Whatever. Give me some fucking water. And then we go down

55
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:48,090
and then we go up. Here it is. It just took a few minutes to get back into the swing of things.

56
00:14:48,090 --> 00:15:06,340
Yeah. And then we go down the elevator. Evil. What do you want? You want, get away from me.

57
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:48,580
Get away from me. Get away from me. Big hit. Me crit. Dude, you healed this BM. Don't you know?

58
00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:07,620
Okay. What did that do? This dude's spamming projectiles. Hey, I'm playing to win. And now

59
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:39,690
we go down the elevator. I actually think we don't. Where do I actually go? I thought that

60
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:54,970
was the progress route. It's not maybe this way. I don't know. Yeah. Cause this is back here.

61
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:05,859
I've been here before. Watch the VOD. I mean, I thought going up there was progress. It's not

62
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:28,759
through the bucket headway. You went into the staff rooms last time. Um, so that was,

63
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:42,549
wasn't that behind the wizard room with the old man? I was just in there though. I gotta go back

64
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:55,059
into the... I just wish I wasn't so fucking confused right now. I could go down here.

65
00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:08,890
I don't think that helps though. It is a very big map. It actually is. Where is game progress

66
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:22,539
though? And how do I get there quickly? Just jump it. Now that, that's like the two zones ago.

67
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,420
Cause going down past the wizard guy was where that pothead was. And I went through there and

68
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:35,369
that just is a shortcut back to one of the first areas. I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

69
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:56,819
There was a flickering door in the very first area. I don't know. I would imagine it would have

70
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:05,529
been here. Maybe back in the... God, I don't know. It was the boss that you said you'd save later.

71
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,259
Yeah. That's what I thought we were doing. I thought, oh, I'm going to go up these stairs.

72
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:11,380
There's the boss. And then we keep going. But that was not what happened. Now I don't know

73
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:46,119
what to do. It's going to start over. Cause like, this is the shortcut to go down here,

74
00:19:46,119 --> 00:20:10,250
which I was already here. Maybe, maybe it is this way. I don't know. That's where I came in.

75
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:22,250
Say please and I'll tell you please. In here, I went down there. That's just a shortcut. Can

76
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,289
I go anywhere else behind? I know I'm just monologuing the entire thing I'm doing,

77
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:35,750
but I'm trying to process where the hell I am. Okay. This is where the wizard was. This just

78
00:20:35,750 --> 00:21:02,519
goes back to the second area. Where the hell am I? That left door? The left door is a shortcut.

79
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:15,289
This goes back down to that, isn't it? Cause this comes up here. We were up here before.

80
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:43,589
This is the quest reward place. I don't think this is right. I remember this. This is it. How

81
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:47,589
did I get so turned around then? Didn't I leave, didn't I leave this area that goes down to the

82
00:21:47,589 --> 00:22:13,640
depths? Oh, hello. Wow. These vaults once held rewards for our heroes. Having restored our good

83
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:21,799
king, a hero returned to a procession and, uh, and play honoring their deeds. We would give them our

84
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,680
most beautiful crafts, not for fighting, just tokens of our adoration, our veneration. Of course,

85
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,039
their story wasn't yet over then. There was still the kidnapping during the festivities. Oh,

86
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,640
good times. Still don't master Smith. Right there. Hit him. But I might be able to try some more

87
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:49,980
complex enhancements. More complex enhancements. All right. Am I, am I doing the cane? Yes or no?

88
00:22:49,980 --> 00:23:15,400
Cane? Yes or no? Is that stupid? I don't have any other weapons to really try.

89
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:34,809
I'm all right for now. Whoa. What does this do? Two, one, 99 to plus 182.

90
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:51,319
648. What is this doing? This is fucking crazy. Is it scaling with decks more? I mean, I feel like

91
00:23:51,319 --> 00:24:01,750
I'm just going to have to do this. I'm doing it. I can't see anything. Thank you for giving me a

92
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:20,309
purpose. Is it worse? I don't know. I think that's better. 281. It was not 281 before. All right.

93
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:34,730
Cool. Thank you. I remember this. Let's fight this. Let's see how much more damage. That's

94
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,730
fucking ridiculous. That is ridiculous. That's like, I just cut him for almost this entire health

95
00:24:38,730 --> 00:25:44,200
pool. That was epic. Goodbye. Clean it up. Yep. There's the fridge. Oh, no. Attack him from behind.

96
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:53,910
Hurry up. That's a lot of fucking people. My computer just almost crashed. I killed them

97
00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:05,349
so bad that my computer almost broke. Yeah. Oh, yep. Yep. All right. All right. All right. All

98
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:11,319
right. All right. I remember this then through here. This is where I stopped streaming. Okay.

99
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,259
All right. Nice. Yes. Everything is good to go. This is exactly. I remember stopping. I'm going to

100
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:35,559
stop right here. Always stop before a boss. Don't ever stop in the middle of a fight. Pull it up.

101
00:26:35,559 --> 00:27:15,940
Oh my God. I got stuck. You guys are on the same team. Oh, fuck. This is bad. Hello? Coward strat.

102
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:31,559
It just has to work. It just has to work. Look, if you and I did the same thing and you died there

103
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:52,250
and I won, I continue to play. You have to start over. I hope it's worth it. Crucible.

104
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:13,079
And I can remember it. I just want to look at it. Strength, unfortunately. So that's not going to

105
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:31,960
work. But I am going to. Should I just remember everything? Why not? Right. It's 3000. That's 3k.

106
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:45,160
It's not worth it. No, it's not worth it. I'm not going to use it. So this thing is really cool,

107
00:28:45,160 --> 00:29:06,279
though. Finally, progress. NPC city. Leisure Lake. Can't get in there. Stivity row. No. Kitchen.

108
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:14,170
Who's your favorite Ice Age character? I'm personally quite partial to Scrat. Um,

109
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:39,099
what's the tiger's name? Not that one. What's the mammoth's name? Manny. This is kind of creepy.

110
00:29:39,099 --> 00:30:00,339
The kitchen. Wait. OK, there we go. Uh, I can level up. Am I just, am I actually just going

111
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:08,920
full on just luck build? Is that stupid? Well, definitely get that. What's the new ability?

112
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:32,309
Stamina recovery when low. Keep memory on death is kind of hysterical. Not bad. Oh,

113
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,549
it is worth remembering because you, the more that you remember, the more shit you unlock. Yeah,

114
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:45,130
that's worth doing. No matter. Yeah, it is actually. Yeah, you get, uh, the upgrades.

115
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:59,180
It's cool. You can unlock the lore. Yeah. The one guy in chat that said it's worth doing.

116
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:21,859
We need to listen to that person more often. Irrelevant appendage. Another strength weapon.

117
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:34,490
Just an arm. OK, continue. So just a TLDR. Those that weren't here last night. The game has a

118
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,609
feature where you have to go to the place that the weapon remembers somewhere in the world or the

119
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:45,529
armor armor too. And you need to be aware of it. You should be checking it pretty frequently. Um,

120
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:53,369
the way the game is on, uh, PC is on Steam. The narrator had taken to scathing others in his

121
00:31:53,369 --> 00:32:08,339
duress. Sudden forget it. What? Don't poop a pixel. I think that's kind of a bad thing.

122
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:26,519
Player housing. Approach the banquet table. Surely there was no hope. That's a crazy looking

123
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:43,289
castle. Curiosity, but void. Wow. Interesting. Damn, bro. That's crazy. Oh, it's our friend.

124
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:51,750
We've been doing this person's quest since we started, so I'm very curious. Hello. Together,

125
00:32:51,750 --> 00:33:09,349
my friend, we shall mean that thing. What if he dies? Wait, um, yes, let's do it. Yes. Yes.

126
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:21,619
Let me get this item first and then we'll go. That's another trinket. All right. This is

127
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:40,789
definitely a boss. How many heels do I have? I got four. Four. Are you coming? Come and help me.

128
00:33:49,940 --> 00:34:37,320
Wait, follow. Let's go. What's this deal? Statue this guy out in the first area.

129
00:34:37,320 --> 00:35:08,579
Nom. Oh my goodness. That's a big combo. Give me a crit. All right. Back it up. Back it up. Back

130
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:30,460
it up. Don't be stupid. Oh, that. Ow. Oh my God. This guy is goofy. I'm dead. That was goofy. That

131
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:42,300
was really goofy. Just like them. I like this boss. What's your opinion on tums? Uh, don't

132
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:52,550
overdo it. Tums are a temporary solution to a potential deeper problem. And why am I? What am

133
00:35:52,550 --> 00:36:03,719
I doing? Yeah, don't, don't abuse it. If you're having acid reflux, if you're having lots of like

134
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,500
GERD problems, uh, you definitely should probably look into it and not just like pop tums, tums,

135
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:17,739
tums, tums, tums every day. There's some medication that can help that stuff. There's also

136
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:22,440
lifestyle changes. Like it might be some food that you're eating. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a

137
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:33,769
doctor. So I don't know. If we talked to a doctor, they would probably be better than me. All right.

138
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:49,260
Let's go together. My friend has, I thought he was a doctor. Oh shit. That's why I'm here.

139
00:36:50,139 --> 00:37:26,250
All right. This, this guy's hard. Oh, all right. He's going to go dance. Free hits, free hits,

140
00:37:50,329 --> 00:38:07,219
dance, dancing, dancing. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, is a clone.

141
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:31,849
This music is fucking crazy. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

142
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:57,019
bro. I ain't even looking anymore. See you later. Nice fight. Tom's dancing pole. And what else?

143
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:10,840
That was something else. You're wicked lame. I completed the encounter. Did you see that?

144
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,320
Did you see that? I went swoosh slash stab at a stab at a stab.

145
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,880
Echo.

146
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,480
I am the greatest. We are.

147
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,400
Nice job.

148
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,320
We're awesome. We're awesome.

149
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:42,889
Thanks for the help. Okay. I got a couple of things I want to look at. Oh, strength. I forgot

150
00:40:42,889 --> 00:41:11,110
to blink. Decreases stamina usage. What did I pick up? It was like a red annoying enemy ahead,

151
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:43,659
but try quick attacks. I went the wrong way. That was the boss room. Warning. Classic David.

152
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:47,909
Oh, David. Come on, David. Get it together.

153
00:41:48,469 --> 00:42:04,659
The narrator felt nostalgia cascaded over the narrator.

154
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:22,900
Oh, that was kind of funny. Oh, it's a I can another blast. Any memories?

155
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,579
Path of the Good Monarch. You carry one relic that can be remembered ahead.

156
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:43,559
I like this zone. This lady just attacked me. What's your deal?

157
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,070
Put down my art, please.

158
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,730
R1, R1, R1, R1.

159
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,849
You might have taken this as an opportunity to dispatch me.

160
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:54,250
True.

161
00:42:54,250 --> 00:43:00,570
Perhaps I misjudged you originally. I am. Well, you may call me.

162
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:08,570
My name has no meaning. Call me Vengeance.

163
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,369
I watched you approach the consumer's banquet. You read Nostalgair of his gluttony.

164
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:17,130
By chance, our paths are aligned.

165
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,769
Across this canyon lies the keep of the stolen crown.

166
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,329
A great one has usurped its throne.

167
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,210
I will purge this kingdom of all that strangle it.

168
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,139
Can I have your weapon?

169
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,750
Though I do not recognize your story, I do know your make.

170
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:41,500
You were one of them, yet also somehow less than them.

171
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,340
And I suspect in some way even less than me.

172
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,260
You all thought I was going to do it?

173
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,099
I mean, none of this is an insult.

174
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:52,380
Your peculiarity may be the thing that saves you from their fate.

175
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,579
Hey, dude. Little Caesar's pretzel crust is back.

176
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,380
Are you kidding me, dude?

177
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,980
I wish you well on your quest, so long as it is true.

178
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,860
Should you falter?

179
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,739
I will kill you.

180
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,780
Not before I kill you first.

181
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,559
We already had an encounter, and I distinctly remember winning that one.

182
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:19,539
I will kill you while you stand,

183
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:24,579
except you kicked the ever-living shit out of me 10 minutes ago.

184
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,780
It wasn't even a contest.

185
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
You kicked the shit out of me.

186
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,300
But I will kill you if you screw this up at all.

187
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,019
I'm watching you.

188
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,750
Is there anything else I can do over there?

189
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:42,389
Nope.

190
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,949
All right, goodbye.

191
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:55,000
Why did he add, hey, dude, to that random pizza crust message?

192
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,219
I don't know, because I...

193
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,460
All right.

194
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,539
I read it, and then I process it, and then the chat is moving so fast sometimes.

195
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,820
That I have to repurpose it, and it's kind of...

196
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,739
It's like, hey, it's gone.

197
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,619
Okay, let me repurpose it and get the gist of what that person was saying.

198
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:23,940
Suddenly, and for no reason at all, and without implying any third-party emotional investment,

199
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,019
hope bridged the divide.

200
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,619
Wait, that was a clue.

201
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:37,420
It was a clue.

202
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,659
The blue shell.

203
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:54,730
A carapace from a road-crossing beast that could knock a carriage off its course.

204
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,980
The narrator was the most exuberant cheerleader in all of Nastal Gaia.

205
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,260
His belief in the institution of heroism was unwavering.

206
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,820
To conduct the hero's journey and articulate its wonder,

207
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,699
the narrator wielded his immense power over Source.

208
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:13,750
Nobody thought much about Source back then, where it came from or what it was.

209
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,110
Magic was simply accepted as part of the code of existence.

210
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,190
After the degradation began,

211
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,989
some who were never meant to access Source began harnessing it through unconventional means.

212
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:28,460
At first, the narrator tried to believe that this was...

213
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,980
This too was part of a greater plan.

214
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,469
This forbidden use...

215
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,710
Everything is fucked up, and it was called a glitch.

216
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,769
But how good is it?

217
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:47,019
I'm about to just put that in my main hand.

218
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:51,559
No, I can't.

219
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,440
70%?

220
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,840
32?

221
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,639
Oh, it's a magic defense shield.

222
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:59,769
Might need it later.

223
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:04,380
You look like Freddy Fazbear.

224
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,500
What are you gonna say now?

225
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,659
Warlock's Wilds.

226
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:31,079
I need a bonfire.

227
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:31,559
Nope.

228
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:32,119
It's this guy.

229
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,280
I don't think I want to unburden anything.

230
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,139
I could unburden the...

231
00:47:58,099 --> 00:47:58,820
That's not worth it.

232
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,300
I don't care.

233
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:06,969
Stop.

234
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:07,929
Stop, Jerma.

235
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:08,250
Stop.

236
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:10,550
Right?

237
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,349
There it is.

238
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:12,730
Yep.

239
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,289
I...

240
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:13,610
Yep.

241
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,250
There it is.

242
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,610
Stop, stop, stop.

243
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,539
Keep the non an NPC.

244
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,250
Smile while they hit you.

245
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,480
All right.

246
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,719
Hold on.

247
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:34,440
Was it her?

248
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:46,980
It's probably another shortcut.

249
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:56,550
Oh, it's...

250
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:56,949
No.

251
00:48:56,949 --> 00:48:57,190
Okay.

252
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:57,829
I thought I pulled it.

253
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,530
I looked over at chat.

254
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,300
God.

255
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,219
I don't want to die down here.

256
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:31,030
I was in another area.

257
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:37,690
Blade the Bold's withered icon.

258
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,170
Oh, shit.

259
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,690
That's another flask.

260
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:56,739
Somebody asked a long time ago if I recommend this game.

261
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,780
The answer is absolutely yes.

262
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,619
Good game design ahead.

263
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:01,260
Let's find out.

264
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,550
Okay.

265
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,829
So it's through this gate.

266
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:24,820
Nice.

267
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:33,659
This game seems way more fleshed out than it needs to be.

268
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,019
It's really surprising.

269
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:37,579
I thought this...

270
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,420
I honestly thought this was going to split it like a joke.

271
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:48,440
I mean, the game is a parody kind of gaming and Dark Souls and whatever, right?

272
00:50:48,440 --> 00:51:01,510
But on its own, it's very, very fun.

273
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,469
20 health, probably?

274
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:02,949
Yeah.

275
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:12,539
I have a lot of crunchies that I have not used, don't I?

276
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:13,420
I do.

277
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:27,239
I don't think this is going to get me there.

278
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:33,420
What do I need?

279
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,789
8,000?

280
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:38,329
9,000?

281
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:38,730
Six.

282
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,050
Okay.

283
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:45,019
Yeah.

284
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,260
Get health to 20 and then I'm going to move on.

285
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,780
But are you made of breadsticks?

286
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:57,849
Have I got any new gear?

287
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,570
I think it's time for some change of clothes.

288
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:09,300
This is 1710.

289
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:17,719
I like that bat roll.

290
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:20,570
Never mind.

291
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,500
Bat roll.

292
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:34,760
The shiny is fine.

293
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,539
I'd like to upgrade it.

294
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:38,460
I'd like to find the remembrance, whatever it is.

295
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,219
All right.

296
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:40,780
Let's move.

297
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Somebody said, what was more painful, Jump King or Millennia?

298
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,869
I...

299
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:00,840
Jump King was sustained horror.

300
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,739
Millennia was bursts of horror.

301
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:06,460
I don't know.

302
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:14,070
Because one is extreme, vast, awful horror.

303
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:19,719
And the other one is just like a slow drip of just pain and suffering.

304
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,659
One happens really quickly and the other one is...

305
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:23,139
I don't know.

306
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,019
They're both bad.

307
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,760
But goddamn, they're fun.

308
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,780
I will never play the Jump King DLC.

309
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,960
No.

310
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,280
Never.

311
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:32,760
Ever.

312
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,769
That is one thing I can guarantee you I would never do.

313
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:45,239
It's never going to happen.

314
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:49,639
I watched the pain and suffering of people playing through the DLC.

315
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:53,019
Just like, no.

316
00:53:53,019 --> 00:54:12,500
New tether.

317
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,329
Nothing glowing.

318
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:23,590
Stick to the path.

319
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,630
Danger ahead.

320
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,940
Step carefully.

321
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,050
Tell me what the fuck to do.

322
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:47,380
Tale of Luck.

323
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,300
What's that?

324
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,300
It's a different weapon upgrade.

325
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,690
There's a lot of weapon upgrade material.

326
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,980
I feel like there's only three types of weapons.

327
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,690
And we've seen like more than three upgrade materials.

328
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,730
Oh shit.

329
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:18,679
Why did that...

330
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:19,239
I...

331
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:21,079
I scared the shit out of me.

332
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:32,389
I guess I wasn't expecting the light to light his face up.

333
00:55:32,389 --> 00:56:18,420
What had come over the sensible narrator?

334
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:24,739
Rather than chronicle the protagonist, more and more he talked of himself.

335
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:28,219
It's a little secret.

336
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:34,309
Britney Clarkson.

337
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,139
Britney Clarkson.

338
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,500
Britney Clarkson?

339
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,980
Who is Britney Clarkson?

340
00:56:42,500 --> 00:57:00,329
Am I fat rolling?

341
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:15,579
What happened?

342
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:27,639
Britney Clarkson.

343
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:30,119
Anti-hero finger wagglers?

344
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:36,170
These are oven mitts.

345
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:43,300
All right, the drip is getting kind of good.

346
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:59,769
The narrator's fate was tied to Nostalgia's.

347
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:03,530
Or perhaps, even were he himself unstrung,

348
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,730
his affection for Nostalgia could never be severed.

349
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,969
Why am I here in footsteps?

350
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,619
Running away.

351
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:23,019
Shut up.

352
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:33,960
All right, well that was annoying.

353
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,010
You know, I didn't know if they were going to put a poison swamp in the game,

354
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,530
but of course they would.

355
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,199
It has to be authentic.

356
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,159
You just fucking...

357
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:51,639
You just...

358
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:53,000
You just snuck up on me.

359
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:54,980
You're just running away?

360
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,239
Bro, they're in the cardboard.

361
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:14,889
I don't have any healing.

362
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:25,420
That rabbit is going to jump out.

363
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,400
You little fucker.

364
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:37,849
Are you real?

365
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:38,409
What is that?

366
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:16,699
I hate this.

367
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:17,179
I'm...

368
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:19,179
This is fucking scary as hell.

369
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:28,889
It's 1030 Pacific.

370
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:34,699
I can't be screaming like this.

371
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:42,500
It's way too late to be screaming like this.

372
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,579
So I went a weird way though.

373
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,500
Maybe I'm going to go right down.

374
01:00:50,500 --> 01:01:11,239
All right, let me check.

375
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:15,530
This whole area is a Zelda reference.

376
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:27,559
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

377
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:36,039
I wonder what being a caster like is in the game.

378
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,559
I wonder what being a caster is like in this game.

379
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,679
I said that's weird.

380
01:01:42,679 --> 01:02:03,820
So what if service?

381
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,719
This is Dex Source.

382
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:10,280
This is the...

383
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:19,429
That's the Zelda sword, right?

384
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:20,230
It probably goes...

385
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,840
It probably has a projectile.

386
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Well, it's not the character I'm making.

387
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,699
Broken of a youthful operation.

388
01:02:30,699 --> 01:02:40,739
I think I just have to use it.

389
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:51,929
Okay.

390
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:52,889
But will you get...

391
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,190
Get out of here.

392
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,690
What did you all...

393
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,260
Oh my god.

394
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,820
Stop.

395
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:14,550
Oh, that's lucky.

396
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,340
Full stamina.

397
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:22,780
Will you stop this?

398
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,500
Will you just fight me?

399
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,780
Get over here.

400
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,780
So what did that do for me?

401
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:39,880
Okay, so it's lit up.

402
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,070
Do I have to light three of them probably?

403
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:49,460
I bet you I have to light three.

404
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,139
Although this is lit up a little better.

405
01:03:51,139 --> 01:04:10,500
Is it gonna hurt?

406
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:17,610
Checking.

407
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,409
Just checking.

408
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:30,780
A lot of money.

409
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,900
My first stream in a long time,

410
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,179
I usually watch VODs.

411
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:54,010
Welcome to the stream.

412
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:54,570
Hey, what's up?

413
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,840
We have a lot of respect for the VOD watchers here.

414
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:09,960
The YouTube video watchers.

415
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,039
I know that not everybody can watch every stream,

416
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:16,570
which you never expected to either.

417
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,929
Whenever you catch one, you catch one.

418
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:25,260
That's it.

419
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,019
All right, this time I went over there and it was bad,

420
01:05:27,019 --> 01:05:29,179
but I have to get the aggro.

421
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:30,550
Which one is it?

422
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:45,019
It's you.

423
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:45,579
All right, yeah.

424
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,659
So you got to turn on the beacon

425
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:49,179
and that gets rid of the poison.

426
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:53,480
It's a good mechanic.

427
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,519
Don't you even...

428
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:03,989
Did you turn to the tree?

429
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:07,400
Thank you.

430
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,579
No.

431
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:26,860
This weapon stinks.

432
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:38,280
Although it isn't upgraded at all, is it?

433
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,800
Save me mask?

434
01:06:39,800 --> 01:07:09,420
All right, that's creepy, but whatever.

435
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,139
Keep it.

436
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,829
I don't...

437
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:13,030
There's no memory on this.

438
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:18,199
So I don't think I can unburden the memory.

439
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:29,849
Nothing.

440
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:37,050
This is where I died.

441
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:44,539
I forgot about you.

442
01:07:44,539 --> 01:08:01,210
Honestly, the luck actually is working out pretty well.

443
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,639
Those crits are awesome.

444
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:05,829
There's the Zelda shield.

445
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:09,269
Oh, it's a hold.

446
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:10,710
Oh, I can just walk through it.

447
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:19,720
I feel like this would have a memory here.

448
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:27,619
Don't you think so?

449
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:34,340
Let's see.

450
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,020
Memory's location is known by a relic

451
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,739
whose memory lingers in Warlock's wild.

452
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,859
So that's where we are.

453
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:52,390
Nothing yet.

454
01:08:52,390 --> 01:09:03,289
Maybe where you get the sword.

455
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:14,340
This is where I started.

456
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:24,939
What's the point of going all the way back?

457
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:31,819
Shortcut for what, though?

458
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:32,300
I guess...

459
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,090
No, that's not...

460
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,289
Really not that far.

461
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:38,340
Very close.

462
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:44,899
I guess I could sit down and level up

463
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:46,659
and get some flasks.

464
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:56,939
Can you please explain why you hit the pink guy every time?

465
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:57,500
I don't know.

466
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:01,420
Can you please address the Botox allegations?

467
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,840
I don't...

468
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:26,970
No, I refuse.

469
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:27,449
All right.

470
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:28,810
I've got enough.

471
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,170
Why do you hit the pink guy every time?

472
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:30,890
Why do you do that?

473
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:31,369
I don't...

474
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:32,729
Stop hitting the pink guy.

475
01:10:32,729 --> 01:11:01,140
Here we go.

476
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:01,460
All right.

477
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,050
So where the heck am I supposed to go?

478
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,420
Oh, fuck.

479
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,699
I forgot you were respawned.

480
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:13,659
Oh, up here.

481
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:14,060
Two.

482
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,180
Oh, my goodness.

483
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,579
All right.

484
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:38,619
Is that all coming up here?

485
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:39,180
All right.

486
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:48,939
I think there's one more.

487
01:11:48,939 --> 01:12:31,220
Ooh, not up here.

488
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,659
You know, I would deal with it,

489
01:12:32,659 --> 01:12:37,060
but I don't give a rat's behind.

490
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,739
I don't give a rat's behind about that.

491
01:12:39,699 --> 01:13:05,460
About fighting that person.

492
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,739
Oh, no, Chris.

493
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:08,180
Game is broken.

494
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:19,510
I got a lot.

495
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:31,800
Wait, another upgrade material?

496
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,079
I don't give a rat's behind.

497
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:34,220
And I know people are going to be like,

498
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,060
I can't believe you're saying this right now.

499
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,300
But I don't give a gosh darn.

500
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:38,859
OK?

501
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:44,649
Everybody knows me as the...

502
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:46,489
I don't say anything bad or anything.

503
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:59,750
But you know, I don't give a rat's behind.

504
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:00,470
Calm down.

505
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:03,300
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

506
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:11,029
Let me let loose.

507
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:33,430
Let me let loose sometimes.

508
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:34,149
Low state.

509
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:41,189
I actually like this area.

510
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:53,529
It's fun.

511
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:54,890
I have the other coin.

512
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,090
Ooh, what's that?

513
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:11,239
Another shortcut?

514
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:27,180
OK, wait, let me unlock this first.

515
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:36,329
You make pigeon noises in your sleep.

516
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:36,890
Oh.

517
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:42,390
What are you talking about?

518
01:15:42,390 --> 01:16:01,770
Like, oh, look at that.

519
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,489
Level up.

520
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:11,500
There's the 20 vitality.

521
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:38,260
Now I'm going to go dex and luck and nothing else.

522
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:47,399
Get luck to 40.

523
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:50,680
My mom said my friend on the screen has to apologize.

524
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,750
I don't really know you.

525
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,859
Don't lie to your mother.

526
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:00,979
Don't lie to your mother like that.

527
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,729
You need to tell your mother the truth.

528
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,229
You're watching a television show and it shouldn't be.

529
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:09,350
Did he get up tomorrow?

530
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:17,960
He said you have to.

531
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:24,409
Yeah, it's Saturday tomorrow.

532
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:25,850
Wait, is it like 4 AM for you?

533
01:17:33,939 --> 01:17:42,460
I tried to double it.

534
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:42,779
Ooh.

535
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,340
All right, I want to go this way.

536
01:17:46,340 --> 01:18:02,229
Are we going to get poisoned?

537
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:04,329
Fire.

538
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:06,649
Oh, yeah.

539
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:14,920
I am on fire.

540
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,119
I look forward.

541
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,949
Hold on.

542
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:25,399
We can't talk yet.

543
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:31,350
Stop it.

544
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:33,590
Ooh, that thing looks cool.

545
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:34,470
What is that thing?

546
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:35,109
Because I want it.

547
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:40,090
I hope it's not a strength.

548
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,210
It's a cake pop.

549
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:44,970
And I can't use it.

550
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,890
I can't use the cake pop.

551
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:50,539
That makes me sad.

552
01:18:55,449 --> 01:19:00,920
The TF2 update thing.

553
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:06,569
That was kind of out of nowhere, wasn't it?

554
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:09,449
I wonder if they're actually going to go through

555
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,529
with making an actual update.

556
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:27,500
Are you a doubter?

557
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,899
I don't know if the word is doubter.

558
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,520
It's just the game's been out for so long.

559
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,199
It would actually be really surprising if they were like,

560
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:39,699
you know, let's start the dev engine back up again

561
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:42,250
and make a bunch of new stuff.

562
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:43,609
It would be kind of...

563
01:19:43,609 --> 01:19:45,909
They edited the post,

564
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:47,989
and it's now a holiday-sized update.

565
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:49,260
They had to clarify it.

566
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,640
It's a holiday size.

567
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,439
It's over, man.

568
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:54,840
Well, I don't know.

569
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,880
Hold on, though.

570
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,619
Just we'll see.

571
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,539
The reason why I didn't bring it up

572
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:07,770
is I didn't want to get excited about it.

573
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,649
We don't know.

574
01:20:08,649 --> 01:20:10,550
It might be good.

575
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,750
It might be crap.

576
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,619
It's got to let them cook.

577
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,460
Oh, fuck.

578
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:38,939
I did this.

579
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:39,579
This is bad.

580
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:40,699
I'm dead.

581
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,140
I thought I could make it up or something.

582
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:48,359
Quit trying to fit in.

583
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:22,920
I don't even care.

584
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:31,899
We all die at some point.

585
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:44,789
Where's the elevator?

586
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:51,579
They go 6,000 souls.

587
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,659
Bring back the cool Jerma.

588
01:21:53,659 --> 01:22:10,569
Bring back cool Jerma.

589
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:11,770
Fall asleep on stream.

590
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:25,460
No, I don't think so.

591
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,739
What was your favorite arc?

592
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:30,939
Somebody said.

593
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:34,699
You know, I thought about this recently.

594
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,859
The amount of time that I've been kind of on

595
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,460
like YouTube and Twitch and everything.

596
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,979
I don't think I could tell you.

597
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:47,689
I think I have fond memories of the whole time I've been here.

598
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:50,039
So I don't think I could really tell you.

599
01:22:50,039 --> 01:23:02,920
I don't have a favorite arc.

600
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:13,300
So many shortcuts.

601
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,140
What is going on here?

602
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,109
What the hell is this?

603
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:20,869
What is going on here?

604
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:32,810
My face.

605
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:34,890
How did I hit my mouth on that wood?

606
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:43,619
I hit like my two front teeth on that.

607
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:54,710
Avoid down.

608
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:57,909
Yeah, but you never know when people are just talking shit.

609
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,399
Could be made up.

610
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:06,739
Is game actually good?

611
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:07,699
It is actually good.

612
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:09,300
I'm promising you it is.

613
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:29,300
All right, so let's keep going the right way.

614
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:35,659
Somebody relics here that I can identify.

615
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:36,539
Nothing.

616
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:37,819
Wait, this is new.

617
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:46,699
Oh, I want to put that on.

618
01:24:46,699 --> 01:24:48,380
Oh, scarecrow.

619
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:56,340
All right, keep going.

620
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:56,979
Please.

621
01:24:56,979 --> 01:25:06,899
I'm just getting greedy now.

622
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:19,180
Are you real?

623
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,739
Yes.

624
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:35,689
Don't even.

625
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:44,520
I actually need more stamina.

626
01:25:44,520 --> 01:26:04,810
I'm running out a lot more frequently now.

627
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,449
Yep.

628
01:26:05,449 --> 01:26:07,000
Bullshit.

629
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:25,340
Girl, why do you look like that?

630
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:29,979
You know, you're the probably 700 millionth person to say that.

631
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:32,939
How dare you?

632
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:41,350
How dare you?

633
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:48,600
Man, but you answer all those times.

634
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,960
How dare you say that?

635
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,949
Bringing up how I answer that question.

636
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:54,630
How dare you ban that person?

637
01:26:54,630 --> 01:27:03,640
How dare they?

638
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,460
How dare you step into a conversation that I was just having with somebody

639
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,779
and say how dare you for me?

640
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:13,180
How dare you ban that person for five to ten minutes?

641
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:24,760
I think this is a maze.

642
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:34,779
It's a maze.

643
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:36,220
Is it a maze or am I just dumb?

644
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:52,920
I think I'm just going backwards.

645
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,590
Yep.

646
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:58,949
I probably have to drop the coins right and know where I've been.

647
01:27:58,949 --> 01:27:59,270
All right.

648
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,869
Yeah, we're doing that right now.

649
01:28:00,869 --> 01:28:02,229
I'm using these coins.

650
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:03,590
I got 34 of them.

651
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,989
Here we go.

652
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:05,430
Let's go.

653
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:07,270
I'm making sure I don't get lost.

654
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:12,069
For instance, I've been here.

655
01:28:12,069 --> 01:28:14,140
I've been here.

656
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,039
I've been here.

657
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:34,140
This is not the right way.

658
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:39,619
I've been here.

659
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:44,250
I came up like a tunnel.

660
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,449
Where the hell did I even go?

661
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:47,100
Is this way?

662
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:47,819
I've been here.

663
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:58,729
Oh, you little dorks.

664
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:38,739
Who's doing this weird shit?

665
01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:39,300
Stop.

666
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:47,430
I thought I had these.

667
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:50,939
Okay.

668
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:51,899
It's hard.

669
01:29:51,899 --> 01:30:15,060
Keep going.

670
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,779
Blood.

671
01:30:15,779 --> 01:30:16,579
All right.

672
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:17,380
I've been here.

673
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:24,220
I've been here.

674
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,140
This is where I've been here.

675
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,819
I'm not going down there again.

676
01:30:27,819 --> 01:30:29,130
In there.

677
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,050
I've now been up here.

678
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:35,689
I've been right here.

679
01:30:35,689 --> 01:30:38,460
I haven't been here.

680
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,180
I've been here.

681
01:30:39,180 --> 01:31:00,199
I've been here.

682
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:16,119
Kind of cool.

683
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,100
Anything else scale with decks?

684
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,220
No, that's the only one I have.

685
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:32,390
You made my little brother cry

686
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,829
when you said rats behind.

687
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:38,520
Yeah, this is the new Jerma.

688
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:55,930
It's the new me.

689
01:31:58,140 --> 01:31:58,859
Problem.

690
01:31:58,859 --> 01:32:10,020
Dark Jerma.

691
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,539
Oh, look, it's our friend.

692
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:15,000
Hello.

693
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:32,890
I thought that was him still talking.

694
01:32:35,609 --> 01:32:36,409
What?

695
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:37,050
No.

696
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,090
Well, yes.

697
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,569
I mean, it's yet to be proven.

698
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:43,260
Come now.

699
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:46,489
I thought that was you.

700
01:32:51,689 --> 01:32:54,250
How dare you say how dare you in this game?

701
01:32:55,289 --> 01:32:56,250
I'm fucking quitting this game

702
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:56,890
and uninstalling it.

703
01:33:10,939 --> 01:33:11,739
They know each other.

704
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:17,579
My friend's heart to love a thing so much

705
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,100
to hold responsibility for that thing

706
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,060
and it'd be twisted beyond the tenderness

707
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:24,939
of your stewardship.

708
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,420
That's the goodness.

709
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,180
How dare you in due course,

710
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:32,460
you will confront the greatest of the great ones.

711
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:33,819
Someone has to.

712
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:35,500
Yes.

713
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,779
Well, I suppose I do like riddles.

714
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:42,220
A well spun riddle positions its maker

715
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,699
in the perfect position for what may come

716
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:48,300
obtuse enough to not be held liable

717
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,380
for the ensuing shenanigans,

718
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:55,659
but cryptic enough to suggest unquestionable wisdom.

719
01:33:55,659 --> 01:33:58,699
More importantly, a riddle does not violate

720
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,460
the listener's own discovery.

721
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,619
Back to your quest.

722
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:04,500
Back to your quest.

723
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,220
Friends are rare in nostalgia.

724
01:34:09,539 --> 01:34:11,539
I actually did not really mean to do that.

725
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:13,579
Whoops.

726
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:19,100
Okay.

727
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:19,899
So that's that.

728
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:23,159
I've been here.

729
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:27,989
I've been here.

730
01:34:30,729 --> 01:34:31,369
And I've been here.

731
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:42,180
That thing is going to be,

732
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:42,739
you know what I mean?

733
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:53,739
I love this weapon.

734
01:34:53,739 --> 01:35:04,340
The offhand sword just hits so hard.

735
01:35:06,899 --> 01:35:07,619
Tale of luck.

736
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:48,180
Nothing is vibrating.

737
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,539
Oh, new bonfire.

738
01:35:49,539 --> 01:35:52,810
How do I get over there?

739
01:35:52,810 --> 01:36:13,609
Oh, nice.

740
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:26,550
Memory of a valiant hero.

741
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:31,210
Home of source, blank parchment.

742
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:36,170
I hear a anvil.

743
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:37,529
What's your taco bell order?

744
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:39,130
I need to know as soon as possible

745
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,170
or I'm fucked.

746
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:49,159
You're in the drive-through right now?

747
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:51,750
Shit, come on, man.

748
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,350
Can I help you?

749
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:58,039
Oh, um, hurry up.

750
01:36:58,039 --> 01:37:02,060
Can I get two cheese or gordita crunches

751
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:07,100
and a large Baja blast

752
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:12,149
and one Doritos Locos taco?

753
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:19,449
There you go.

754
01:37:19,449 --> 01:37:29,420
Saved.

755
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:35,590
Can I not open this door?

756
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:37,189
We have the same fucking order.

757
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:40,859
I think that's the only order at Taco Bell.

758
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:44,470
I don't, I think everything else is not worth ordering.

759
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:45,989
We're all going to have a very similar order

760
01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:55,770
because that's the order.

761
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:57,609
Such a ridiculous gate.

762
01:37:57,609 --> 01:38:01,529
Was there a humility implicit in its frame?

763
01:38:01,529 --> 01:38:05,050
A humility so long ago forsaken.

764
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:07,770
Here it is.

765
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:10,899
I don't have a coin.

766
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:12,260
What?

767
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:15,619
What about a crunch wrap?

768
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:19,779
The issue with Taco Bell is...

769
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,640
All right, let's go over this.

770
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,199
During my tier list, I brought this up.

771
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:29,510
Taco Bell has 20 items on the menu.

772
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:31,590
They're all B minus.

773
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:36,729
They have one thing on the menu that is an S plus.

774
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:39,979
I don't...

775
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:42,460
If you have something on the menu that is S plus,

776
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:45,659
it's so hard for me to order the B minus items.

777
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:47,020
Even though they're okay, they're good.

778
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:47,659
They're not bad.

779
01:38:47,659 --> 01:38:49,850
I enjoy them.

780
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:51,369
But the cheesy gordita crunch is...

781
01:38:52,789 --> 01:38:54,470
If I'm going to go to Taco Bell,

782
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,810
I'm going to get cheesy gordita crunches.

783
01:38:56,810 --> 01:39:00,329
Everything else is like two or three rungs down for me.

784
01:39:00,329 --> 01:39:02,250
So it's like, oh man, I'm going to go to Taco Bell.

785
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:02,810
Oh, you know what?

786
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:04,090
Let me try one of the...

787
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:04,729
No, fuck that.

788
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:06,010
Cheesy gordita crunch, S plus.

789
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:07,289
No, what else?

790
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:09,289
It's hard to do that.

791
01:39:09,289 --> 01:39:11,369
Because I don't go to Taco Bell.

792
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:13,529
Holly and I don't go to Taco Bell that often.

793
01:39:13,529 --> 01:39:15,289
So when we do, it's like...

794
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:19,939
Should I get the chalupa?

795
01:39:19,939 --> 01:39:24,220
No, no, no, of course not.

796
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,100
All right, let's go.

797
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:33,029
No dialogue?

798
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:37,510
You just did almost 400 plus damage.

799
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,699
I'm going to be a cheese ball.

800
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:46,090
I like the other stuff at Taco Bell.

801
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:48,569
It's just I didn't sit down at the bonfire.

802
01:39:48,569 --> 01:39:49,529
Oh my God, help me.

803
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:19,220
God, maybe I should do stamina.

804
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,979
No, let's keep dex.

805
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,260
Let's get to like 25 dex.

806
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:42,600
What's the worst fast food restaurant?

807
01:40:44,359 --> 01:40:44,920
I don't know.

808
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:46,970
I'm trying to think.

809
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:49,380
What is the worst fast food restaurant?

810
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:49,619
Huh?

811
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:51,699
There ain't supposed to be an anvil in the wilds.

812
01:40:51,699 --> 01:40:56,180
Disguarded amidst so many tools of field and forge.

813
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:56,500
Who would do this?

814
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,300
My fingernails.

815
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:57,859
My fingernails are long.

816
01:40:57,859 --> 01:40:59,699
Even those who hate your kind still got to work.

817
01:41:00,579 --> 01:41:02,979
This wasn't just discarding some traditions.

818
01:41:03,939 --> 01:41:06,100
It was a discarding of tradition itself.

819
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:06,420
BK.

820
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,899
I wonder what this anvil has helped forge.

821
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:10,579
Maybe I can replicate the feats.

822
01:41:11,619 --> 01:41:11,939
Oops.

823
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:18,250
Yeah, I mean, I kind of gauge how much I like a restaurant based on how many.

824
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,210
Look, everyone goes, oh man, that fast food restaurant sucks.

825
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:27,909
But I gauge how high up on the list it is for me based on how often I go.

826
01:41:27,909 --> 01:41:35,689
And I have not been to a Burger King in I think the last time I actually went to.

827
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:39,670
But before doing that Whopper thing that everybody seems to like,

828
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:53,020
um, before doing that, it was all the time that I ate two cheeseburgers.

829
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:57,109
Because I was getting a blood test and I was freaking out because I didn't eat all day.

830
01:41:57,109 --> 01:42:00,869
And I ate two fucking, did I tell this story before?

831
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:03,960
I've told this story before.

832
01:42:07,859 --> 01:42:09,060
No, I think I have.

833
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:09,699
I definitely have.

834
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:14,729
I haven't, I swear I have.

835
01:42:14,729 --> 01:42:15,850
Whatever, I'll tell it real quick.

836
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:21,060
So, um, one time, this is, I mean, probably five years ago,

837
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,899
at least at least three or four years ago, something like that.

838
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:26,500
I had a doctor's appointment to go get blood work.

839
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,029
And I didn't eat all day.

840
01:42:29,029 --> 01:42:30,470
And you know when you get your blood taken?

841
01:42:31,689 --> 01:42:35,220
It's, I don't, I'm not afraid of needles or anything.

842
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:38,500
I'm not afraid of going to the doctor and like, oh, no, no, no, don't like, don't do that.

843
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:45,779
But if I haven't eaten at all, I like to be well fed because you can get a little,

844
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:49,300
I don't know, you can get kind of lightheaded sometimes if you don't for some reason.

845
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:54,020
Um, yeah, fasting before blood work and yeah, I'm not, I don't know.

846
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:57,479
But still, I get a little lightheaded sometimes.

847
01:42:57,479 --> 01:43:01,689
But so I'm, I didn't eat all day.

848
01:43:01,689 --> 01:43:05,300
And I was like, fuck, I, I gotta go, I'm going to the doctor's appointment.

849
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,579
I need to eat something.

850
01:43:06,579 --> 01:43:09,140
I don't want to get like, they're taking all my blood out.

851
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,100
And then I'm like, oh, I'm like, I feel woozy or whatever.

852
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,020
You know, I feel a little weird.

853
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:15,859
So how long did you fast?

854
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:17,609
I just hadn't eaten.

855
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:19,289
I didn't, I don't think I had to fast for this blood work.

856
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:21,449
You don't have to, you don't have to fast for all of your blood work.

857
01:43:21,449 --> 01:43:22,489
Only certain blood work you do.

858
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:26,090
So I didn't have to fast, but I was like, okay, I want to eat something.

859
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:28,489
So I went to Burger King was the only thing I could think of.

860
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:32,180
I was like, fuck what's like here right now.

861
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:34,819
And I just driving, driving, driving like, I, there's a Burger King right here.

862
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,340
Burger King.

863
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,739
It's like, I don't want Burger King, but whatever, I have to do this.

864
01:43:38,739 --> 01:43:41,779
But my appointment was in like 20 minutes.

865
01:43:41,779 --> 01:43:42,899
It was in like 15 minutes.

866
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:45,460
So I'm just like, fuck, all right, go to the drive-through.

867
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,140
I'm just going to get something small, nothing big.

868
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,340
And I want to like, overdo it.

869
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:54,579
I got two regular cheeseburgers, just two plain cheeseburgers from Burger King.

870
01:43:54,579 --> 01:43:56,420
And I just ate them really fast.

871
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:59,430
And then I kept going to the doctor.

872
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:03,060
I got my blood taken.

873
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,449
I know I didn't eat that much.

874
01:44:05,449 --> 01:44:06,489
So I got my blood taken.

875
01:44:06,489 --> 01:44:07,369
I was like, everything's fine.

876
01:44:07,369 --> 01:44:07,850
I feel good.

877
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,409
I feel all right.

878
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:12,729
And I hear back from the doctor, you know, like a week later.

879
01:44:12,729 --> 01:44:17,050
Hey, I just want to talk to you really quickly about your cholesterol is a little high.

880
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:21,800
And I was like, oh shit.

881
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,300
And I'm sitting there thinking, is it the cheeseburgers?

882
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:29,619
Because I ate two cheeseburgers like 15 minutes before getting my blood taken.

883
01:44:29,619 --> 01:44:30,500
So I said that.

884
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:36,680
I was like, oh, I had like two cheeseburgers like right before the blood test.

885
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,880
That's probably what it was, right?

886
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:43,449
And the doctor was just like, no, that's not what happened.

887
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:48,520
I thought that I had like cheeseburger blood before I went to get that blood test.

888
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:52,729
And I'm sitting there going, no fucking way.

889
01:44:52,729 --> 01:44:56,250
I'm telling you, if I went to go take that test again, and I ate like spinach,

890
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,770
salmon, and a bunch of broccoli, it would have been lower.

891
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:02,600
That's what I really felt.

892
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:05,239
And there's the story.

893
01:45:05,239 --> 01:45:08,310
I thought I had cheeseburger blood.

894
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,680
Oh, your cholesterol is a little bit high.

895
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,319
It's not too bad.

896
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:15,800
But you know, we really should probably try to get that brought down.

897
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,920
Oh, well, see, I ate two cheeseburgers.

898
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,680
So it's like, you fucking idiot.

899
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:30,020
I want to upgrade.

900
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,619
Ah, I need one more.

901
01:45:31,619 --> 01:45:33,350
Shoot.

902
01:45:44,649 --> 01:45:48,220
I got to find another weapon I like.

903
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,479
Now address the grilled cheese off the floor.

904
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:01,159
That's not real.

905
01:46:01,159 --> 01:46:03,640
I made that up like 10 minutes before the stream.

906
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:11,460
I don't even remember the context of what we're talking about.

907
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:12,500
I don't even remember.

908
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:17,699
I was in pre-stream chat today and I said, oh, yeah, I ate a grilled cheese off the floor.

909
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,060
I don't know.

910
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,579
I thought it was funny for five seconds.

911
01:46:24,649 --> 01:46:25,930
Guys, I'm almost 40.

912
01:46:27,579 --> 01:46:31,819
As an almost 40-year-old man, you don't eat grilled cheese off the floor.

913
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,729
That just doesn't happen anymore.

914
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:42,279
I mean, maybe when I was like 10, maybe I dropped a grilled cheese on the ground.

915
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:45,020
He's almost 40.

916
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:47,670
Yeah, bro.

917
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:48,899
All right.

918
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:50,579
I need to play my video game now, please.

919
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:54,729
What age are you allowed to eat grilled cheese?

920
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:57,210
There's no, I'm just saying like if you're like a 10-year-old and you're like, oops,

921
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,170
I dropped my thing.

922
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:59,050
I don't care.

923
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,819
As a 40-year-old man, somebody has the log.

924
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:11,510
It's me and hey, dude, I heard you ate a grilled cheese once that fell on the floor.

925
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:12,550
Is this true?

926
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:14,710
And then I said, bro, fucking leave me alone.

927
01:47:18,819 --> 01:47:22,619
That's what I said.

928
01:47:23,579 --> 01:47:28,569
I feel like I should have an FAQ, but it would be 30 pages long.

929
01:47:28,569 --> 01:47:31,930
There are too many questions, some not even based in reality.

930
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:34,250
Hey, dude, I heard you ate a grilled cheese once off the floor.

931
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:34,810
Is this true?

932
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,090
Bro, fucking leave me alone.

933
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:37,210
Of course it is true.

934
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:38,970
But I don't want to say it all the time.

935
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:45,899
But that was a joke reference or whatever.

936
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:47,420
You get it.

937
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:12,260
Somebody said, dude, you keep pretending that you're some normal

938
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:19,930
40-year-old, but you just talked about a story how you thought you had cheeseburger blood.

939
01:48:19,930 --> 01:48:23,050
But that's like a funny story.

940
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:26,890
By the way, that was also like years ago.

941
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:28,729
That was not like yesterday.

942
01:48:28,729 --> 01:48:34,899
I promise I am a functioning adult.

943
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:36,300
It was like three years.

944
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,500
It's years ago.

945
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:44,390
I didn't think.

946
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:46,789
I just like was a thought that crossed my mind.

947
01:48:51,899 --> 01:49:01,430
You're concerned about cheeseburger blood as a 37-year-old.

948
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,909
Oh, we just have fun conversations sometimes.

949
01:49:07,289 --> 01:49:09,210
It's not that deep.

950
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:21,079
I've been here.

951
01:49:21,079 --> 01:49:23,800
You also told a story about drinking espresso on the toilet.

952
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,500
Yeah, but so what?

953
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,340
So what?

954
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:33,340
I'm living life a little, all right?

955
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:33,819
So what?

956
01:49:33,819 --> 01:49:34,939
I'm living life a little.

957
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,520
We can't do that, apparently.

958
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,000
No, you can't drink an espresso on the toilet.

959
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,840
I'm living my life, all right?

960
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,939
You can live yours however you want.

961
01:49:44,939 --> 01:49:47,100
I'm living my life.

962
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:59,930
Where am I going?

963
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:00,890
Why is this over here?

964
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:03,829
It's a dead end for no reason.

965
01:50:11,609 --> 01:50:13,609
Yeah, I'm just I'm living my life.

966
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:17,750
Okay, this is this is progress here.

967
01:50:36,979 --> 01:50:39,779
Yeah, I just I felt I sometimes I just feel like doing stuff.

968
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:47,260
I saw that you prop hunt mother butthead.

969
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:06,010
Where are you?

970
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:11,060
Yeah, I got hey, we got a motto on this channel called you do you.

971
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:16,250
If I want to drink an espresso on the toilet, I'm doing it.

972
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:18,090
And you know what?

973
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:19,689
I'm doing it tomorrow morning.

974
01:51:19,689 --> 01:51:21,899
I'm doing it tomorrow morning.

975
01:51:21,899 --> 01:51:23,100
That sounds like a great idea.

976
01:51:23,579 --> 01:51:52,090
You poured orange juice into a purse.

977
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:01,289
Yeah, I fuck around a lot.

978
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:12,220
I remember that.

979
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,340
Oh, demonic.

980
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:15,020
Look at this demonic shit.

981
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:19,880
And let me correct the record on this.

982
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,079
It was banana milk.

983
01:52:21,079 --> 01:52:33,579
What are they sacrificing this?

984
01:52:33,579 --> 01:52:36,220
Is that a kid?

985
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:40,119
Why am I killing this?

986
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:41,159
Why did I just kill that kid?

987
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,079
Oh, wait.

988
01:52:47,079 --> 01:52:47,560
Interesting.

989
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:55,579
Hold on.

990
01:52:55,579 --> 01:52:56,140
Really?

991
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:56,699
Come on.

992
01:52:56,699 --> 01:52:57,020
Really?

993
01:52:58,659 --> 01:52:59,380
Damn.

994
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:22,600
What I figured it would have been here.

995
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:28,840
You ever had vanilla ice cream with soy sauce?

996
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,619
No, I don't think I probably ever would probably.

997
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:34,779
I don't really like soy sauce that much.

998
01:53:34,779 --> 01:53:35,739
I'm not a soy sauce fan.

999
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:42,039
I like soy sauce very, very rarely with sushi.

1000
01:53:42,039 --> 01:53:43,159
And that's pretty much it.

1001
01:53:43,159 --> 01:53:53,720
I like to dip the sushi into the soy sauce.

1002
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,880
Take a tiny little bit of wasabi right on top.

1003
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:57,539
Done.

1004
01:53:57,539 --> 01:53:58,260
Easy.

1005
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:03,159
Spicy tuna roll like salmon roll or even like a good.

1006
01:54:03,159 --> 01:54:03,560
Yeah.

1007
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:04,199
Oh, yeah.

1008
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:07,739
It's probably the only way I eat sushi.

1009
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,699
I love wasabi.

1010
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:19,449
I love nasal heat, nasal heat.

1011
01:54:19,449 --> 01:54:22,630
It's what I like more than mouth heat.

1012
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:25,770
I find mouth heat to be.

1013
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,890
Did I get a coin?

1014
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:38,119
I didn't get a coin yet.

1015
01:54:38,119 --> 01:54:46,470
Shit.

1016
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:48,890
No, no, I did.

1017
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,449
No, I did.

1018
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:56,659
Do you miss Boston area Chinese food?

1019
01:54:56,659 --> 01:54:58,659
I miss a lot of Boston area food.

1020
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:07,000
I guess not with Vinny.

1021
01:55:08,199 --> 01:55:10,119
Vegas food is phenomenal.

1022
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:23,239
Some of the best sit down restaurants I've ever been to.

1023
01:55:23,239 --> 01:55:28,680
But a lot of those East Coast delis, sub shops, pizza places, Chinese food.

1024
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:32,789
There's a lot of really, really, really good ones.

1025
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:35,979
I miss the snow too.

1026
01:55:40,819 --> 01:55:41,619
I love Vegas.

1027
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:47,590
It's kind of like both sort of completely different climates.

1028
01:55:49,189 --> 01:55:52,229
I love the sun shining.

1029
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,569
It's super nice.

1030
01:55:54,569 --> 01:55:58,840
It's just it's always sunny outside.

1031
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,020
Always.

1032
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,220
It's just every time you wake up in Las Vegas, especially from.

1033
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:07,619
I want to say it gets cold here.

1034
01:56:07,619 --> 01:56:08,420
It does get cold.

1035
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:14,390
It gets to be somewhere in the mid 30s Fahrenheit.

1036
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:22,539
But besides like a month or two of the winter, it is beautiful every single day.

1037
01:56:22,539 --> 01:56:27,270
Every day.

1038
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:31,050
Because that's one of the things that I had an issue with in on the East Coast.

1039
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:33,850
It felt like there were more rainy days.

1040
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:37,689
There were more kind of just dreary days than there were sunny days.

1041
01:56:37,689 --> 01:56:42,899
And I felt like I really wanted to get in a different environment like that.

1042
01:56:42,899 --> 01:56:48,020
That was more sunshine.

1043
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:52,939
And a lot of people don't like the heat out here because it can get to be in the Fahrenheit.

1044
01:56:52,939 --> 01:57:02,939
It does get to be somewhere in the 110 to 115, 120 Fahrenheit sometimes.

1045
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:04,579
But I kind of like it.

1046
01:57:04,579 --> 01:57:05,300
I don't know why.

1047
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:10,260
It's just so it's so ridiculous.

1048
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,500
It's just so it's like an oven outside.

1049
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,979
It's it's so something about it.

1050
01:57:14,979 --> 01:57:15,380
I don't know.

1051
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:16,020
I like it.

1052
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:22,739
It's just so much more different than anything I've ever experienced.

1053
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:24,739
And it's not sweaty because it's a dry heat.

1054
01:57:25,699 --> 01:57:28,500
You got to be careful though because it's dry heat.

1055
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:33,939
There is not very much humidity in Vegas or the whole state of Nevada.

1056
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:36,659
So you don't sweat.

1057
01:57:36,659 --> 01:57:41,899
It's just hot.

1058
01:57:41,899 --> 01:57:47,180
I have been in really hot days in the Boston area.

1059
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:52,300
85, 90, 95 degrees in the Boston area is awful.

1060
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,250
I'm like soaking wet.

1061
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,170
It's it's just humidity.

1062
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:01,609
85 in Boston is not as bad.

1063
01:58:01,609 --> 01:58:02,170
That's not true.

1064
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:04,970
90 in Boston is not as bad as 115 in Vegas.

1065
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:26,840
I'm telling you this isn't.

1066
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,199
Oh, stay with them.

1067
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:38,220
Are we talking about humidity right now?

1068
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:46,789
Now I humidity is Boston was kind of really got everything.

1069
01:58:46,789 --> 01:58:48,420
It got a bunch of snow.

1070
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,619
It got a bunch of heat.

1071
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:51,380
It got a bunch of fall weather.

1072
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:54,729
Actually fall in Boston is like my favorite thing.

1073
01:58:54,729 --> 01:58:59,300
I think fall in Massachusetts is almost not comparable.

1074
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,260
What's with this thing?

1075
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:05,670
Is it weird?

1076
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:12,039
Are you doing that?

1077
01:59:12,039 --> 01:59:14,710
I isn't going to poison me, isn't it?

1078
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,359
I can't wait.

1079
01:59:20,359 --> 01:59:21,880
I'm out of coins.

1080
01:59:25,829 --> 01:59:26,550
Actual lizard.

1081
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:29,189
You're the type to spend your day laying on a rock.

1082
01:59:29,189 --> 01:59:35,979
Hey, do not dog wizards.

1083
01:59:35,979 --> 01:59:39,340
I'm not wizards.

1084
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:41,100
Don't talk about wizards like that.

1085
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:57,100
Should I just tank it and run?

1086
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,840
Or is that stupid?

1087
02:00:05,529 --> 02:00:07,539
Dude, is it stupid?

1088
02:00:07,539 --> 02:00:08,579
Should I tank it and just run?

1089
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:13,659
How much further do I have to possibly go?

1090
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,859
Dude, get off of.

1091
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:49,699
No, I want to say yes.

1092
02:00:55,050 --> 02:01:43,300
Again, I bring the camera back.

1093
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:59,939
Somebody.

1094
02:01:59,939 --> 02:02:04,500
Wait, somebody said they had a chicken sandwich because of me and they're pissed or something.

1095
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,260
What happened?

1096
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:10,579
How could I serve?

1097
02:02:10,579 --> 02:02:14,460
Why are you mad at me?

1098
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:19,050
Let's go again.

1099
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:24,250
Plus three.

1100
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:25,770
This thing is deadly now.

1101
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:29,619
It's deadly.

1102
02:02:29,619 --> 02:02:38,310
All right.

1103
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:40,229
This is tower number three.

1104
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:42,140
I need to find another coin.

1105
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:53,220
I think the kids have the coin.

1106
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:56,060
Oh, I'm still mad.

1107
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,619
I got an original chicken sandwich because of you and it wasn't very good.

1108
02:02:58,619 --> 02:02:59,819
You have one from Burger King?

1109
02:03:14,890 --> 02:03:16,090
Long chicken sandwich.

1110
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:20,060
Oh, I mean, it's that really my fault.

1111
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:25,000
I don't the last time I really went to Burger King for real, real, for real.

1112
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:27,460
I don't know.

1113
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:30,340
It's probably 10, 15, I don't know, 10 years ago.

1114
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:33,140
And I got a long chicken sandwich and I was like, yeah, that was all right.

1115
02:03:33,140 --> 02:04:01,859
A lot of here.

1116
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:05,539
You know, Burger King could probably be really, really good.

1117
02:04:05,539 --> 02:04:06,340
And I would never know.

1118
02:04:11,109 --> 02:04:11,670
What is that?

1119
02:04:14,539 --> 02:04:15,979
Has anybody been there recently?

1120
02:04:24,579 --> 02:04:24,899
Okay.

1121
02:04:24,899 --> 02:04:25,930
Yeah.

1122
02:04:25,930 --> 02:04:28,859
How is it?

1123
02:04:28,859 --> 02:04:29,739
Is it fine?

1124
02:04:29,739 --> 02:04:30,300
Is it all right?

1125
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:33,340
It's mid.

1126
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:38,810
They have good French toast.

1127
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:44,460
I don't know if I read that wrong, but that kind of makes me want to go.

1128
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,260
Is that real?

1129
02:04:55,779 --> 02:04:56,420
French toast.

1130
02:04:56,979 --> 02:04:58,659
Burger King has French toast.

1131
02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:01,270
What dimension am I in?

1132
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:02,550
How have I never heard of this?

1133
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:22,090
I'm eating a double whopper right now and give us a rating out of 10.

1134
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:32,859
How is it?

1135
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:33,260
Two?

1136
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,300
I don't think that's the same person.

1137
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:42,149
That's dead space.

1138
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:42,869
Hold on.

1139
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:43,989
I need to look at that.

1140
02:05:43,989 --> 02:05:49,180
Seven out of 10.

1141
02:05:49,180 --> 02:06:03,079
I can put on the dead space gear.

1142
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:05,859
That's funny.

1143
02:06:05,859 --> 02:06:07,739
It's fat rolling.

1144
02:06:07,739 --> 02:06:09,100
Unfortunately, this is strength.

1145
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:20,279
But I feel like something is vibrating.

1146
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:25,909
No, I could probably keep the helmet.

1147
02:06:25,909 --> 02:06:31,930
Chesapeake's probably too much.

1148
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:32,890
Still fat rolling.

1149
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:40,840
70% right?

1150
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:41,479
71.

1151
02:06:42,039 --> 02:06:50,739
That works.

1152
02:06:50,739 --> 02:07:00,760
Oh, yep.

1153
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,319
Token.

1154
02:07:01,319 --> 02:07:02,649
Okay.

1155
02:07:02,649 --> 02:07:04,250
Now where's tower four?

1156
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:11,029
They gave it an eight out of 10.

1157
02:07:11,029 --> 02:07:15,859
The bacon double cheese XL is a 10 out of 10 is what they said.

1158
02:07:15,859 --> 02:07:16,899
Delicious.

1159
02:07:16,899 --> 02:07:20,619
We got a delicious.

1160
02:07:20,619 --> 02:07:25,909
Okay.

1161
02:07:25,909 --> 02:07:29,369
Bacon double cheese burger?

1162
02:07:29,369 --> 02:07:30,489
XL though.

1163
02:07:30,489 --> 02:07:34,619
That's a big ass burger.

1164
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:37,510
How much bigger is the...

1165
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:39,510
Why does it have like t-shirt sizes?

1166
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:40,149
When did...

1167
02:07:40,149 --> 02:07:43,029
Is there like a small, medium, large XL, triple XL?

1168
02:07:43,029 --> 02:07:58,500
Why is it like a shirt?

1169
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,100
That's a man-sized viewer.

1170
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:11,750
All right.

1171
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:14,550
Time to try to find where that fourth tower is.

1172
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:23,270
I used to get the rodeo burger in mod chat.

1173
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,909
VR Josh.

1174
02:08:23,909 --> 02:08:24,149
Yeah.

1175
02:08:24,149 --> 02:08:26,470
The rodeo burger was actually fantastic.

1176
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:33,699
If you don't know, the rodeo burger at BK was a tie-in with small soldiers.

1177
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:34,979
It was a movie.

1178
02:08:37,449 --> 02:08:38,409
That movie came out.

1179
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:44,250
And that burger was attached to it.

1180
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,489
It was probably the single best item they ever came up with.

1181
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:53,750
It never left?

1182
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:55,800
Why do I feel like it did?

1183
02:08:58,039 --> 02:08:59,880
It definitely did for a while.

1184
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:02,119
I know it did because I remember it wasn't there.

1185
02:09:02,119 --> 02:09:13,210
Is this tower four?

1186
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:17,079
No, it's tower three.

1187
02:09:17,079 --> 02:09:17,720
Well, I'm going to...

1188
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:23,989
All right.

1189
02:09:23,989 --> 02:09:25,670
Pause this conversation for five seconds.

1190
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:27,909
I need to find the right route.

1191
02:09:27,909 --> 02:09:29,670
I need to look and not look at chat.

1192
02:09:29,670 --> 02:09:30,550
Give me a minute.

1193
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:36,170
I don't think it's this one.

1194
02:09:36,170 --> 02:09:43,640
Shit, I went down here already.

1195
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:44,439
Where's my coins?

1196
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:02,810
Game did that thing again where it minimized.

1197
02:10:03,369 --> 02:10:06,279
That was weird.

1198
02:10:06,279 --> 02:10:07,180
All right.

1199
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:07,819
He's not looking.

1200
02:10:07,819 --> 02:10:08,699
Tell him he sucks.

1201
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:12,970
I used them all.

1202
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:20,710
Rodeo burger is definitely still around and it smacks.

1203
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:35,829
I like it.

1204
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:50,649
The reason the rodeo burger is great

1205
02:10:50,649 --> 02:10:55,479
kind of reminds me of my five guys order, which is...

1206
02:10:56,890 --> 02:10:57,689
Let me see if I get this right.

1207
02:10:57,689 --> 02:11:04,539
Rodeo burger is barbecue sauce, onion rings, and something else.

1208
02:11:04,539 --> 02:11:06,699
Barbecue sauce, onion rings, single patty.

1209
02:11:06,699 --> 02:11:10,090
What else is on it?

1210
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,119
Is it bacon on it too?

1211
02:11:14,119 --> 02:11:14,520
No way.

1212
02:11:15,779 --> 02:11:17,859
It was tower three that you need to activate.

1213
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:19,529
Oh, thank you.

1214
02:11:20,090 --> 02:11:22,659
I thought it was four.

1215
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:25,060
Wait, the coins are numbered.

1216
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:25,460
That's right.

1217
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:25,779
I thought...

1218
02:11:25,779 --> 02:11:26,819
Yeah, I thought it didn't matter.

1219
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:36,810
There's no cheese on it, right?

1220
02:11:36,810 --> 02:11:51,609
Please try the spicy honey chicken sandwich

1221
02:11:51,609 --> 02:11:53,850
with fried pickle chips from Wendy's.

1222
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:55,369
Sounds like a lot, but I promise it's amazing.

1223
02:11:57,529 --> 02:12:00,010
I haven't been to Wendy's in a very long time.

1224
02:12:10,329 --> 02:12:12,970
Our meaning is gone.

1225
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:18,409
Time arrived when you confront the final great one.

1226
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,579
Could help you.

1227
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:22,460
Oh, let's kill this person.

1228
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:27,100
If first you could restore what has been lost.

1229
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:30,939
Perhaps the spindles could prove a hero.

1230
02:12:30,939 --> 02:12:39,079
The narrator watched.

1231
02:12:39,079 --> 02:12:40,680
There's probably a remembrance thing here.

1232
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:43,369
You hit so hard.

1233
02:12:43,369 --> 02:12:45,689
It's unbelievable how strong that was.

1234
02:12:46,329 --> 02:12:54,409
I'll get crit.

1235
02:12:54,409 --> 02:13:03,220
What do you got?

1236
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:04,420
Translucent map.

1237
02:13:08,819 --> 02:13:09,319
Yeah.

1238
02:13:09,859 --> 02:13:10,739
Okay, there's...

1239
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:11,699
Is it the...

1240
02:13:11,699 --> 02:13:12,579
No, not the shield.

1241
02:13:12,579 --> 02:13:13,619
Just the sword.

1242
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:34,550
I want to put it on.

1243
02:13:36,819 --> 02:13:37,319
Damn it.

1244
02:13:37,779 --> 02:13:42,630
You're going to address the KFC mashed potato.

1245
02:13:42,630 --> 02:13:46,020
What are you talking about?

1246
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:47,939
I love KFC, but I never go.

1247
02:13:47,939 --> 02:13:49,460
I have 21,000 souls.

1248
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:49,939
Hold on.

1249
02:14:16,569 --> 02:14:17,449
KFC is good.

1250
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:21,050
KFC falls into that same category for me, though,

1251
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:23,210
of I never choose to go there,

1252
02:14:23,210 --> 02:14:25,930
but I will eat it and love it if you present it to me.

1253
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,720
Like raisins.

1254
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:47,859
Yeah, that's also pretty true.

1255
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,720
Yeah.

1256
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:54,260
I would eat a whole box of raisins right now

1257
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,220
if it appeared in front of me.

1258
02:14:55,779 --> 02:14:56,819
Just boop.

1259
02:14:56,819 --> 02:14:58,010
They're right there.

1260
02:14:58,010 --> 02:14:59,289
I would eat the whole box,

1261
02:14:59,289 --> 02:15:01,300
but I'm never going to buy them.

1262
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:02,579
I'll never purchase them.

1263
02:15:02,579 --> 02:15:12,579
All right, let's see what the boss is here.

1264
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,640
Raisins are nice.

1265
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:26,039
They're fine.

1266
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:31,979
How do I get back down?

1267
02:15:31,979 --> 02:15:32,539
Let's drop.

1268
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:48,539
I had some famous Elbertson egg salad for lunch.

1269
02:15:48,539 --> 02:15:52,229
Ooh, that's a good choice.

1270
02:15:52,229 --> 02:16:03,100
How do I get where I need to go?

1271
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:31,130
This way?

1272
02:16:31,130 --> 02:16:31,770
Whoa.

1273
02:16:31,770 --> 02:16:41,540
I've only been able to use this one spell.

1274
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:45,030
I wonder how the other ones are.

1275
02:16:45,030 --> 02:16:47,350
Oh, but I didn't even answer the question.

1276
02:16:47,350 --> 02:16:49,110
Somebody said, what's the worst fast food restaurant?

1277
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:50,600
I don't, I don't think,

1278
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,159
honestly, every bad fast food place in quotes,

1279
02:16:55,479 --> 02:16:57,079
there's a reason to eat there.

1280
02:16:57,079 --> 02:16:58,760
I know a lot of people,

1281
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:02,139
oh, what about Jack in the Box?

1282
02:17:02,139 --> 02:17:04,219
Jack in the Box has these little tacos

1283
02:17:05,079 --> 02:17:06,120
and they are crack.

1284
02:17:11,159 --> 02:17:12,120
So it's probably, no,

1285
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:14,680
but Sonic, the food is awful.

1286
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,889
The food at Sonic is awful,

1287
02:17:18,659 --> 02:17:21,059
but all their drinks are so good

1288
02:17:21,059 --> 02:17:22,579
that I can't say that it sucks.

1289
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:24,180
That would be not right.

1290
02:17:31,059 --> 02:17:32,819
I've eaten at Jack in the Box and gone,

1291
02:17:32,819 --> 02:17:35,899
that was pretty good with their little tacos.

1292
02:17:54,170 --> 02:17:58,200
I don't, I thought this was going to be

1293
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,879
much simpler than I thought.

1294
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,100
How do I get out of here?

1295
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:05,219
What about White Castle?

1296
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:10,010
I have never eaten at White Castle, truly.

1297
02:18:11,989 --> 02:18:15,270
I don't know if I've ever truly eaten that one.

1298
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:17,799
Arby's, I've only eaten at Arby's

1299
02:18:17,799 --> 02:18:18,840
I think once in my life

1300
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,719
and I didn't really like it.

1301
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:21,319
So I haven't really given it that much of a chance.

1302
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,059
I'm lost.

1303
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:36,979
Ronald McDonald or the King?

1304
02:18:36,979 --> 02:18:37,940
Be honest, please.

1305
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:38,819
It's not about the food.

1306
02:18:38,819 --> 02:18:40,340
Who's the better, oh, Ronald McDonald all day.

1307
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,620
Ronald McDonald all day.

1308
02:18:49,059 --> 02:18:51,299
I don't even need to see who Ronald McDonald is fighting.

1309
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:52,979
He wins every time.

1310
02:19:08,139 --> 02:19:09,899
Ronald McDonald versus God.

1311
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,069
Aren't they the same thing?

1312
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:30,229
Amen.

1313
02:19:31,909 --> 02:19:33,270
All right, where am I going?

1314
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:35,270
I don't know how to get to this place.

1315
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,959
I saw it from a distance,

1316
02:19:41,959 --> 02:19:53,020
but I don't know how to get over there.

1317
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:55,260
Dude, how do I get the fuck out of here?

1318
02:19:55,260 --> 02:20:02,760
I need to go look from above again.

1319
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:06,170
Why do I feel like this is a different area?

1320
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:14,120
I feel like I'm stuck here.

1321
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:16,139
How do I get out of here?

1322
02:20:16,139 --> 02:20:26,840
This is why I dropped the coins

1323
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:27,799
and the coins are gone

1324
02:20:27,799 --> 02:20:29,319
because I reloaded the area.

1325
02:20:29,319 --> 02:20:46,790
I found it.

1326
02:20:46,790 --> 02:21:13,799
I think I got it.

1327
02:21:13,799 --> 02:21:26,360
Yeah, Grimace was cool, too.

1328
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,819
They were all cool.

1329
02:21:27,819 --> 02:21:31,639
All right, is it that way?

1330
02:21:31,639 --> 02:21:33,159
It's that way.

1331
02:21:33,159 --> 02:21:35,000
All right, so I got to go down that way.

1332
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:40,569
Grimace was the man.

1333
02:21:40,569 --> 02:21:41,129
You know what I mean?

1334
02:21:41,129 --> 02:21:42,010
Grimace was awesome.

1335
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:47,379
One of my favorite Grimace lines.

1336
02:21:47,379 --> 02:21:49,510
I'll never forget it.

1337
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:51,030
God, remember what you remember?

1338
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,899
Hey, Ronald.

1339
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:57,450
Fucking legendary saying.

1340
02:21:57,450 --> 02:22:02,260
Just sends chills up and down my spine.

1341
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:12,729
I'm just like, God, Grimace is a fucking man.

1342
02:22:12,729 --> 02:22:14,489
Remember what he used to say?

1343
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:17,850
Ronald, I love classic shakes.

1344
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:21,180
Just God damn, man.

1345
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:24,219
He's such a cool motherfucker.

1346
02:22:24,219 --> 02:22:25,340
Where am I going?

1347
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:26,299
I'm sorry.

1348
02:22:26,299 --> 02:22:27,579
Where am I going?

1349
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,530
I need to go that way.

1350
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:43,959
Don't kill me.

1351
02:22:43,959 --> 02:22:44,920
Down here.

1352
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:50,459
Okay, I need to get there.

1353
02:22:50,459 --> 02:22:53,979
How do I even get over?

1354
02:22:53,979 --> 02:22:59,319
Down here, down there, straight through there.

1355
02:22:59,319 --> 02:23:01,829
And up there.

1356
02:23:01,829 --> 02:23:02,549
Let's go.

1357
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:09,059
No one, and I mean, no one knows what you're talking about.

1358
02:23:09,059 --> 02:23:11,850
Somebody does.

1359
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:15,059
You don't remember the classic Grimace lines?

1360
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:48,629
Is this right?

1361
02:23:58,659 --> 02:24:01,979
No, I already lost.

1362
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:05,819
Yeah, it's the fucking Zelda forest.

1363
02:24:05,819 --> 02:24:09,159
What are you linking me?

1364
02:24:09,159 --> 02:24:09,799
What is this?

1365
02:24:09,799 --> 02:24:25,620
Hold on.

1366
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:26,579
Bony fingers.

1367
02:24:26,579 --> 02:24:30,649
What is this?

1368
02:24:30,649 --> 02:24:31,850
I don't know how you do it.

1369
02:24:32,409 --> 02:24:35,450
I put together some really impressive deals.

1370
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:38,170
But this thing you've pulled off, it's amazing.

1371
02:24:38,969 --> 02:24:41,129
A big and tasty for just a dollar.

1372
02:24:41,129 --> 02:24:41,850
How do you do it?

1373
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:42,649
What's your secret?

1374
02:24:46,979 --> 02:24:48,340
He didn't even say anything.

1375
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:50,100
He didn't even say anything.

1376
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:52,100
No, that's not the classic Grimace line.

1377
02:25:02,819 --> 02:25:03,860
We could own this town.

1378
02:25:04,979 --> 02:25:05,700
Of course we will.

1379
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:08,409
He didn't even say anything in this commercial.

1380
02:25:08,409 --> 02:25:09,370
He doesn't even talk.

1381
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:11,370
Why did you link this to me?

1382
02:25:17,399 --> 02:25:18,200
You know Grimace.

1383
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,159
What the fuck?

1384
02:25:23,159 --> 02:25:24,600
He never spoke?

1385
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:25,559
Yes, he did.

1386
02:25:25,559 --> 02:25:26,840
Grimace had a voice.

1387
02:25:29,670 --> 02:25:30,709
Grimace had a voice.

1388
02:25:30,709 --> 02:25:46,840
And I know it.

1389
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:48,360
Did Grimace walk this way?

1390
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:49,719
No, he walked this way.

1391
02:25:49,719 --> 02:25:50,280
There it is.

1392
02:26:07,110 --> 02:26:08,790
I knew you liked happy endings.

1393
02:26:37,059 --> 02:26:37,940
What the hell?

1394
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:43,639
I got to get out of here.

1395
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:46,629
Barney rubble.

1396
02:26:46,629 --> 02:26:47,270
All right.

1397
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:49,940
Where is this place?

1398
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:51,379
I hate getting lost.

1399
02:26:51,379 --> 02:26:55,180
I was too busy laughing at Grimace.

1400
02:26:55,180 --> 02:27:34,889
And I don't remember where I am.

1401
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:35,770
Am I going the right way?

1402
02:27:50,010 --> 02:28:03,750
I'm out of stamina.

1403
02:28:06,889 --> 02:28:08,090
Get off me, Donnie.

1404
02:28:08,090 --> 02:28:12,739
If I die right now, I'm going to do a huge Grimace.

1405
02:28:12,739 --> 02:28:22,709
It's going to be the biggest Grimace you've ever heard.

1406
02:28:22,709 --> 02:28:23,510
Oh my god.

1407
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,909
I don't want to.

1408
02:28:23,909 --> 02:28:24,870
I actually don't want to do it.

1409
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:26,389
I just said that to be an idiot.

1410
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:27,750
It was just me making a dumb joke.

1411
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:29,670
I actually don't want to do a Grimace voice.

1412
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:31,850
Just get away from me.

1413
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:32,729
Get away from me.

1414
02:28:32,729 --> 02:28:37,879
Hey, boys and girls.

1415
02:28:37,879 --> 02:28:39,479
Everybody loves a McDonald's.

1416
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:41,319
Free me shakes.

1417
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:54,870
I don't know where to go now.

1418
02:28:54,870 --> 02:28:58,149
I got chills from that, dude.

1419
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:10,620
Get the hell away from me.

1420
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:23,430
Fuck, I forgot where to go.

1421
02:29:24,229 --> 02:29:26,149
Oh no, I hate this place.

1422
02:29:26,149 --> 02:29:27,670
I was right there.

1423
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:29,000
It's I have to go.

1424
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:29,399
No, no, no, no.

1425
02:29:29,399 --> 02:29:30,040
I know.

1426
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:34,659
I got to go to where I fought the lady with the wings.

1427
02:29:34,659 --> 02:29:35,219
Where?

1428
02:29:35,219 --> 02:29:39,430
Fuck if I remember where that is.

1429
02:29:39,430 --> 02:29:42,790
Where is somewhere like in the midsection here, right?

1430
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:43,750
It's above.

1431
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:49,479
It's like over.

1432
02:29:49,479 --> 02:29:50,360
Where is it?

1433
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:51,000
I don't remember.

1434
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,360
Everything's green and foggy.

1435
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:54,360
I can't see anything.

1436
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:56,120
Everything is green and foggy.

1437
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:57,799
I where's my visibility?

1438
02:29:57,799 --> 02:29:58,600
I have no visibility.

1439
02:29:58,600 --> 02:30:00,260
I don't know where I'm going.

1440
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:02,020
Where is that place where I fought that lady?

1441
02:30:04,489 --> 02:30:06,329
You've played this game for like 10 hours.

1442
02:30:06,329 --> 02:30:10,250
I haven't played in the Zelda forest for 10 hours.

1443
02:30:14,889 --> 02:30:17,930
Everything's foggy and everything's disconnected.

1444
02:30:18,489 --> 02:30:19,450
I know I have to go down.

1445
02:30:20,889 --> 02:30:21,770
Where is that?

1446
02:30:21,770 --> 02:30:22,569
Where do I fight that lady?

1447
02:30:25,719 --> 02:30:37,500
That way.

1448
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:41,750
Has there ever been a rogue's gallery like McDonald's?

1449
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:43,959
No.

1450
02:30:43,959 --> 02:30:44,440
Who comes?

1451
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,319
Nobody even comes close.

1452
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:15,059
Those of you that are wondering what happened,

1453
02:31:15,059 --> 02:31:30,340
I was reading chat and walked in a complete circle.

1454
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:31,780
All right, let's try this shit again.

1455
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:32,739
No more messing around.

1456
02:31:32,739 --> 02:31:36,250
No more grimace bullshit.

1457
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:48,229
Just get me over there.

1458
02:31:48,309 --> 02:31:49,350
Is grimace in hell?

1459
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:52,700
I think grimace is still alive.

1460
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,319
So no.

1461
02:31:55,319 --> 02:32:03,639
And then it's this way, right?

1462
02:32:03,639 --> 02:32:17,559
Oh my god.

1463
02:32:17,559 --> 02:32:18,840
I have to do this.

1464
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:46,920
Didn't even get hit.

1465
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,639
Do a poll.

1466
02:32:47,639 --> 02:32:48,120
Do a poll.

1467
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:48,840
All right, do a poll.

1468
02:32:48,840 --> 02:33:14,469
Is grimace in hell?

1469
02:33:14,469 --> 02:33:15,270
Don't.

1470
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:16,389
Seriously, dude.

1471
02:33:16,389 --> 02:33:19,219
I just want to get out of here.

1472
02:33:19,219 --> 02:33:25,510
Grimace is not.

1473
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:27,510
And the fact that you would say that grimace is,

1474
02:33:29,139 --> 02:33:30,100
it just saddens me.

1475
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:34,459
It just disappoints me.

1476
02:33:34,459 --> 02:33:38,379
Like just it just it you saying that grimace is in hell

1477
02:33:38,379 --> 02:33:39,579
is disappointing to me.

1478
02:33:55,049 --> 02:33:56,329
Yeah, what did he even do?

1479
02:33:58,059 --> 02:33:59,659
What did why is grimace in hell?

1480
02:33:59,659 --> 02:34:00,620
What did grimace do?

1481
02:34:05,319 --> 02:34:07,559
He's a capitalist mascot.

1482
02:34:07,559 --> 02:34:15,959
Grimace is a nice is a nice character.

1483
02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:18,200
Grimace is not in hell.

1484
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:20,819
I this is a long poll.

1485
02:34:40,069 --> 02:34:43,260
Okay, here we go.

1486
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:48,700
Who is grimace?

1487
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:57,190
The big purple guy from McDonald's.

1488
02:34:57,190 --> 02:35:02,790
If you're curious, he sounds like this.

1489
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:03,270
Gotcha.

1490
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:06,700
I know a lot of you just muted the stream.

1491
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:07,899
Well, did it for no reason.

1492
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:17,659
Watch out for bad game design.

1493
02:35:17,659 --> 02:35:19,100
Avoid curiosity.

1494
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:26,870
Is the squirrel?

1495
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:40,680
All right.

1496
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,399
What is it?

1497
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:49,739
What's the verdict?

1498
02:35:49,739 --> 02:35:52,459
63% of you think that you know what?

1499
02:35:52,459 --> 02:35:58,200
At least I'm happy that there's like almost 40% of you

1500
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,579
have not lost your minds.

1501
02:36:00,979 --> 02:36:02,979
Something amazing has spawned.

1502
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:06,260
No, you silly.

1503
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:08,579
Though you sure are swell.

1504
02:36:08,579 --> 02:36:10,180
When your cycle started,

1505
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:13,700
an innocent, uncorrupted NPC also appeared.

1506
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:16,659
That hasn't happened for ages.

1507
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:20,100
Hey, I have a fun idea.

1508
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,100
How about you find them

1509
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:25,059
and bring them a little gift from me?

1510
02:36:25,059 --> 02:36:25,860
This guy's weird.

1511
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:27,540
An innocent wouldn't be able to stay

1512
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:30,420
innocent long in this messed up world.

1513
02:36:32,260 --> 02:36:35,290
What the hell is that?

1514
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:45,430
Is this Dex?

1515
02:36:45,989 --> 02:36:46,229
No.

1516
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:58,979
What is this?

1517
02:36:58,979 --> 02:37:11,540
Give it to an innocent?

1518
02:37:15,899 --> 02:37:19,690
What so many cycles had crumbled.

1519
02:37:19,690 --> 02:37:22,090
Might it yet be restored?

1520
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:24,870
Dare the narrator hope.

1521
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:25,350
Oh, shit.

1522
02:37:29,799 --> 02:37:31,479
Keep of the Stolen Crown.

1523
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:36,729
Very interesting.

1524
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:41,719
Very interesting.

1525
02:37:41,719 --> 02:37:43,239
So interesting, in fact,

1526
02:37:43,239 --> 02:37:45,959
that we're gonna have to finish this another time.

1527
02:37:45,959 --> 02:37:55,559
I like this area.

1528
02:37:55,559 --> 02:38:09,270
Good fast food stream.

1529
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:13,500
They're all fast food streams.

1530
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:14,860
I just hide the fact that they're not.

1531
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,290
But yeah, thanks for watching.

1532
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:31,659
That was a really, really fun day.

1533
02:38:31,659 --> 02:38:34,500
Wild Hearts seems pretty fun.

1534
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:35,780
I might play some more of it.

1535
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,899
I don't know if I'll play it on stream,

1536
02:38:37,899 --> 02:38:40,459
but it's definitely something I think I'm interested enough

1537
02:38:40,459 --> 02:38:41,739
to get through some of it.

1538
02:38:43,989 --> 02:38:46,469
Not that it matters, but thanks again to EA

1539
02:38:46,469 --> 02:38:48,870
and the developers of that game

1540
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:55,579
and for sponsoring that part of the stream a few hours ago.

1541
02:38:55,579 --> 02:38:56,620
And thanks for watching

1542
02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:58,459
and thanks for sticking around during that.

1543
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:01,319
Thank you.

1544
02:39:01,319 --> 02:39:04,360
And then this was fun, too.

1545
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:06,540
A lot of nice time tonight.

1546
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:10,940
I had a great time.

1547
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:14,459
So the next time you see me is going to be...

1548
02:39:16,309 --> 02:39:17,989
I want to finish this game.

1549
02:39:17,989 --> 02:39:21,739
We probably only have like a couple hours left.

1550
02:39:21,739 --> 02:39:30,979
Let's say Monday.

1551
02:39:30,979 --> 02:39:32,409
No, no, no, no, no.

1552
02:39:32,409 --> 02:39:34,659
No, I got that wrong.

1553
02:39:34,659 --> 02:39:38,120
Sunday is technically...

1554
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:39,000
Wait, no, no, no.

1555
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:44,899
Tomorrow would technically be Sunday, right?

1556
02:39:44,899 --> 02:39:45,700
Technically.

1557
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:50,709
So yeah, we'll finish it up Sunday.

1558
02:39:50,709 --> 02:39:57,819
And after we finish this, we'll pivot to something else.

1559
02:39:57,819 --> 02:39:58,299
We'll see.

1560
02:39:58,299 --> 02:40:08,340
Have a great evening.

1561
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:11,690
See you all soon.

1562
02:40:11,690 --> 02:40:14,360
Let me just make sure I save the game.

1563
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:17,180
I think it saves automatically.

1564
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:22,680
Yes, it does.

1565
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:29,239
Same time.

1566
02:40:29,239 --> 02:40:30,840

02:40:33,479 --> 02:40:36,520
Vinny made that way, way, way more fun and way more interesting for me.

1568
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:39,270
So thanks, Vinny.

1569
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:48,280
Take care of yourselves.

1570
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:52,020
Get some sleep or good morning, whatever one it is.

1571
02:40:52,020 --> 02:40:53,299
I'm going to go get some food.

1572
02:40:53,299 --> 02:41:06,139
Call your mother?

1573
02:41:06,139 --> 02:41:08,979
Well, I mean, maybe not right now.

1574
02:41:08,979 --> 02:41:10,709
Might be late.

1575
02:41:10,709 --> 02:41:17,860
We'll see you Sunday.

1576
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:21,399
Goodbye.

1577
02:41:21,399 --> 02:41:22,440
See you later.

1578
02:41:22,440 --> 02:42:22,579
Take care.

1579
02:42:22,579 --> 02:42:23,459
Yeah, that was a little late.

1580
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:24,760
Whoops.

1581
02:42:27,500 --> 02:42:28,000
See you tomorrow.

1582
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:48,600
Tomorrow as in Sunday.

1583
02:42:49,239 --> 02:42:51,639
It's technically Saturday night right now.

1584
02:42:51,639 --> 02:42:55,799
So like in a day and a half, a day, a day and a half, two days.

1585
02:42:56,680 --> 02:42:58,709
See you later.
