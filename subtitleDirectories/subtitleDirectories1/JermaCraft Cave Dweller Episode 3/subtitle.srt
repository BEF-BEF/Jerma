00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,400
Why, hello there. Welcome to another episode of Germacraft.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,939
And as you can see, I'm doing a little bit of renovating.

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:17,210
Doing some renovations on the house, if you could tell, because this thing is a mess.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,050
Just trying to clean it up a little bit.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,010
And oh my god, no, this has happened before.

6
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,410
Don't worry, got it under control.

7
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,800
So I changed the brightness to be a little brighter.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,399
And I also made the black bars on the sides of the video.

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,039
That's probably gone now, at least I'm hoping they are.

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,039
Because they were kind of annoying on the top and bottom.

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,679
So let's do some adventuring.

12
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,079
I already did a little bit of, I did some stuff before we started.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,039
I got some torches, I got a couple of tools, got a little bit of iron.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,920
And it's time to go on an adventure.

15
00:00:54,009 --> 00:01:01,100
Iron sword, already got a shovel, got a pick, I got some rotten flesh.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,219
I don't even know what this thing is.

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,820
What the hell is a slime ball?

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,540
What does that do?

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,489
I have no idea.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,579
Let's get another pick.

21
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,489
Just because I know I'll probably need it.

22
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,829
Two shovels, a sword, a bunch of sticks.

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,659
I need to make, do I have enough?

24
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,420
I do not have enough.

25
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:32,709
Shoot, I think that'll be all right.

26
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,939
I got to get, I want to put this iron away.

27
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,620
All right, that's next on the agenda.

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,500
You know what, screw this.

29
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,420
I'm just taking it off the house.

30
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:48,469
I'm cutting down my preliminary wall so I can make a case.

31
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,390
So I don't lose all my items if I die.

32
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,430
Because that is a real big pain in the ass.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:05,780
KKK, let's make, there it is.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,340
A chest, a golden chest.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,580
Put it right here.

36
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,979
Put half the coal in there, put the iron in there.

37
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,930
The slime ball and the sticks.

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,300
I got a bunch of sand.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,419
What the hell am I going to do with that?

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,310
Okay, so now if I die, it's not a complete and total waste of time.

41
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,020
Let's go.

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,569
Try to find some kind of cave system here.

43
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,030
Because I had some iron from before.

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,389
I found a little bit of iron before.

45
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:40,460
Keep going.

46
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,180
We'll go this way now.

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,099
We'll dig, we'll dig straight this way.

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,949
You never know what you're going to run into in Germacraft.

49
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,020
Or Minecraft for that matter.

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,389
By the way, the music in this game is really, really good.

51
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,370
I, the composer's name is what?

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,969
Like C3, something like that.

53
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,889
It's some kind of crazy stage name he has.

54
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,900
He's a talented guy.

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,719
Because this stuff is really, really soothing.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,639
He nailed it.

57
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,080
He absolutely nailed it.

58
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,759
Mine coal.

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,860
Mine coal.

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,379
We got to keep going forward and keep going below with the coal.

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,060
Mine steel.

62
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:29,610
Mine steel.

63
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,539
We got to mine that steel and mine that cobblestone.

64
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,229
Where the hell am I even going?

65
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,969
All right, let's go.

66
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:45,050
I will find something before this pick breaks.

67
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,060
Or it was, it'll kill me.

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,889
Oh yeah.

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,020
Aimlessly digging around.

70
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,879
Best part about Minecraft.

71
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,280
Torch.

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,060
Ooh, we found a little bit of coal.

73
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:07,659
That's good.

74
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:17,240
Ooh, I will definitely take you.

75
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,079
And you.

76
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,480
And you.

77
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,170
I'm going to give you all names too.

78
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,689
Your name's going to be Coley.

79
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,620
Your name's going to be Steamy.

80
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,019
And your name's going to be Diarrhea.

81
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,019
Because that's what you kind of look like.

82
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,139
Diarrhea.

83
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,259
Well, there's a lot of coal here.

84
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,500
Uh oh, I think I'm going to get lost.

85
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,220
I think I already am lost.

86
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,230
Ladies and gentlemen, we found gravel.

87
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,540
Which means...

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,959
All right, I want...

89
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,480
I don't know why I'm doing this.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,959
Why?

91
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,800
All right, enough gravel.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,720
We got a lava pit.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,620
What else is in here?

94
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,839
Okay.

95
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,120
Ooh, that goes down.

96
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm going to block this off.

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,019
This is really risky and I hope I don't die.

98
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,029
Ooh, okay.

99
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,310
Nice.

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,629
Nice.

101
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,379
And there goes the lava.

102
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,339
It is now disappearing.

103
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,379
Let's see if I can...

104
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,660
Ooh, I see iron.

105
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,540
I see iron.

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm going to accidentally fall in this.

107
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,060
I know it.

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,579
I'm going to accidentally spill it.

109
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,800
Just like a hot cup of coffee on my new pair of pants.

110
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,560
All right, I think that should be good.

111
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,490
Give me that iron.

112
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,209
Only one?

113
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,149
There was only one thing of iron there.

114
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,029
You got to be kidding me.

115
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,100
I do not approve of that.

116
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,740
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,180
One iron.

118
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,300
How unlucky is that?

119
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,629
Yeah, well.

120
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,670
Ooh, there's even more.

121
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,019
I got a sword this time.

122
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:16,500
So you're...

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,699
Ooh, more iron.

124
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:23,509
Let me get this first.

125
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,550
All right, so this is a big intricate little cave system.

126
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,470
Big intricate little cave.

127
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,490
I like the sound of that.

128
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,610
Oh, hi there, guys.

129
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,250
You didn't think I had a sword this time, did you?

130
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,649
Goodbye.

131
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,730
And thanks for coming.

132
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,410
Oh, I don't think you understand.

133
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,610
I got a sword this time.

134
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,889
I'm not messing around anymore.

135
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,170
I'm hungry too, apparently.

136
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,449
You're dead.

137
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:47,660
What does he...

138
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,220
Is there lava?

139
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,199
He had his lava over there.

140
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,079
All right, I need to eat this rotten, disgusting flesh.

141
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,350
Hold on.

142
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,129
Can you puke in this game?

143
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,129
Because I would definitely puke from eating this.

144
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,410
Oh, like...

145
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:02,649
What?

146
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,689
What's going on?

147
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,180
What's going on?

148
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,139
Am I, like, toxic?

149
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,779
Am I going to die?

150
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,990
Oh, God.

151
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,269
This is great.

152
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,959
Now I have, like, toxic green blood.

153
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,259
Are you serious?

154
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,600
What the hell?

155
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,100
What are you doing?

156
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,939
Dude, you are, like, levitating right now.

157
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,060
Do you need some help with something?

158
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,019
Ha ha ha.

159
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:27,769
Yeah, you need some help.

160
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,639
Oh, okay.

161
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
I don't have any more picks, do I?

162
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,470
Nope.

163
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,379
Time to make the trek back.

164
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,899
Hopefully I can find my way.

165
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,259
Or else I am...

166
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,410
Look at this sneaky...

167
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,779
Whoa!

168
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,339
Okay, that...

169
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,139
Okay, really?

170
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:45,639
No!

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,060
Oh.

172
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,480
My.

173
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,699
God.

174
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,420
You have...

175
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,459
You've got to be kidding me.

176
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,579
That was...

177
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,259
How was that even possible?

178
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,740
There were two creepers sitting in, like, the same...

179
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,569
Exact spot together in the same pixel?

180
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:09,850
Oh, my God.

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, my God.

182
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,100
Look at this sneaky...

183
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Whoa!

184
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,459
Okay, that...

185
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,420
Okay, really?

186
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,920
No!
