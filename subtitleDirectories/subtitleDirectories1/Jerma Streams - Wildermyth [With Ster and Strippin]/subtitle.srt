1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,330
All right, let's go.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,009
Okay. All right. Welcome to.

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:09,740
Welcome, everybody.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,369
Welcome to filter myth. A tale of dragons and danger.

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,289
And guess what? I'm like five minutes early.

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,809
It said somewhere around 12 to one.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,730
Let's go. Here we are.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,690
Hi, everybody.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,250
How do you got a character in mind?

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,850
Do we have like a whole race selection?

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,890
I don't know.

12
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,809
We're going to make our character.

13
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,010
Your character is important.

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,170
We can either randomize our characters,

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,530
but I think it might be better if we make them.

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,450
I think that's fun.

17
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,740
Oh, I got to tweet this too.

18
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,799
Okay. We got a couple options here.

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,820
We have the age of old tricks.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,539
I think we should do that.

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,299
That's like the standard campaign.

22
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,780
Let's go with that.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,740
Sounds good.

24
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,460
How do you spell this?

25
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,460
Wilder.

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,909
Is it not on the top left of your screen right now?

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,980
Yeah, dude, I'm looking down at my phone and I'm like,

28
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,060
how do you spell it?

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,299
Oh, there it is.

30
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,379
Okay. Wilder myth sounds fun.

31
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:15,859
Okay, let's go.

32
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,799
Okay. Right.

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,120
So you guys should, you guys see the screen right now?

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,760
Yes.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,180
Okay. So we're going to allocate one, two, three.

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,299
You guys are now in control of your characters.

37
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,659
So you want to, you can click them

38
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,060
and you can start customizing.

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,140
Oh, okay.

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:38,980
So the top left.

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,219
I clicked randomize once and I'm happy.

42
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,459
Okay. So the top left, you can scroll along

43
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,099
and you can kind of like auto people.

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,219
And then you've got like the bottom left is the most important

45
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,900
and this is probably why you don't want to randomize stuff

46
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,340
is because you need to customize your like aspects.

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,540
His name is Alunga and it looks like me.

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,620
Like I'm done.

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,420
I don't even have a chat.

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,780
Okay. You don't want to customize

51
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,540
like any aspect of his personality.

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,560
You happy with him?

53
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,289
Oh, okay. There's a whole, there's a huge thing here.

54
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,229
Okay.

55
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,870
Yeah. So the bit you're going to, you can,

56
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,550
if you want to write a backstory, you can.

57
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,509
That normally the randomly generated ones are pretty funny.

58
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay.

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,400
And then the biggest thing is you go to history

60
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,020
and you can pick like three traits.

61
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,370
So you can pick like, you know, potential library and brash.

62
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,379
So this is pretty detailed then.

63
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,620
Yeah. And like picking all this stuff will determine

64
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,180
like it will determine like your character interactions,

65
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,860
how he behaves, what might happen to him,

66
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,659
the decisions he'll make all that stuff.

67
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:58,009
Is there, where does your class come in?

68
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:03,139
Like that comes in later.

69
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,740
So essentially this is a RPG DND AI roguelike

70
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,699
that we're going to be playing and it's in the same realm.

71
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,569
Yeah.

72
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,750
I just turned my stream on and I haven't been talking so.

73
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,430
Yeah. Relationship simulator.

74
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,379
Okay.

75
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,340
So there will be combat.

76
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,659
It'll be kind of like tactics based.

77
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,740
If you've played like a Final Fantasy tactics or game like that,

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,389
it's like, it'll be like a top down, like hex board.

79
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:34,389
And then the combat's pretty fun.

80
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,009
But between the combat will be long periods of story

81
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,889
and what we'll do is we'll voice our own characters

82
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,689
and the AI will generate our dialogue and our.

83
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:44,090
Really?

84
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,969
And what happens.

85
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:45,960
Yeah.

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,159
Why have I never heard of this game?

87
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,240
That sounds, that sounds, this sounds amazing.

88
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,960
It's such a charming game, but like not many people have heard.

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,219
Okay.

90
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,139
Yeah. I kind of forgot about it.

91
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm like a youth.

92
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah.

93
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,180
Currently locked in.

94
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,849
So if right now we've got Starr is the hunter

95
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,530
and Gemma is the mystic.

96
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,250
Wait, where am I?

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,460
I am the warrior.

98
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,180
See where it says at the top, future warrior, hunter and mystic.

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,379
Where do you change that?

100
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,300
If you don't want to be a hunter.

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,899
I don't know if you can change it.

102
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,459
I'm cool with being the mage.

103
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,569
That's cool with me.

104
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,980
If you want to be the warrior though so we can swap.

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,009
Oh, no, I think it just gives you one of each

106
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,879
and then we can assign them.

107
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,500
Is there a hair, a hair color?

108
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,019
Normally we can pick them, but this is like the base campaign.

109
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:47,980
So it's kind of like.

110
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,379
Oh, okay.

111
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,819
So this is a tutorial too.

112
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:57,990
So we like locked in.

113
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,310
All right.

114
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,430
I think, I think that's wait.

115
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,870
Should I have a beard or something?

116
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,779
All right.

117
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,259
That's good.

118
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,139
No, that's good.

119
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:09,860
I did my history.

120
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,980
What did you guys do for your history?

121
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,620
Can you write it?

122
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,819
Yeah, you can if you want.

123
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,519
Oh, no, I was talking about the like the three drop downs.

124
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:28,259
Yeah, I'm going to do destiny, shame, but also.

125
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,980
I did dreamer, clown and nostalgic.

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,759
That yeah, that sounds like you.

127
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,079
I thought you said streamer.

128
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,560
Streamer.

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,639
Oh, shit.

130
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:47,959
All right.

131
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,439
I think so is the names are here.

132
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:52,709
Yeah, I'm excited.

133
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,670
This is going to be fun.

134
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:06,310
Is there any other customizations?

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,790
We should.

136
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,670
Jesus, are there any other customers?

137
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,829
The way they said that, like, oh my goodness.

138
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,660
Are there any other customizations that we can do?

139
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,050
I think you get more if we.

140
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,850
This is like just the first campaign to kind of show you the ropes.

141
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,329
Oh, we can do hair color and everything like that.

142
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,930
Yeah, you can do hair color and all that kind of stuff.

143
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,839
The main thing is the three the three aspects in history is like important.

144
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,040
And then if you got to customize, you've got like size, color,

145
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,480
head and face and then your name.

146
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,189
Man, if you could do character creator before you were born,

147
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,779
how long would you spend in it?

148
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,579
Days.

149
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,329
That sounds like weird.

150
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,819
Wait, would you just hit the randomize button?

151
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,019
No, I just named my character Smushman, but it was just like, I don't know.

152
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,860
I already have that character name.

153
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,980
Nine months.

154
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,220
Yeah, you got nine months of character creation.

155
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,019
Yeah, that's true.

156
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,720
What if like you had nine months and then like you were one day

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,360
from the nine month limit and you accidentally hit like randomize

158
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,399
and everything, all your hard work was just like undone, like bam.

159
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,769
Oh, I forgot to save.

160
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh, that's not good.

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:37,319
I'm just going to get born like that name in dogwood details.

162
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,959
OK, all right.

163
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,120
Well, this is just a trial run we're doing, right?

164
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,759
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

165
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,240
No, this is literally who you will be for the rest of your life.

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,959
OK, let's go.

167
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,339
Welcome to Wildermyth.

168
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,939
OK, so the best way to do this is like one person will kind of be in control of

169
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,339
when we go to the next slide.

170
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:01,220
OK.

171
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,500
If either of you want to be that guy or you just want me to do it and then

172
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,259
kind of read along.

173
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,079
I'm not ready for that responsibility.

174
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,040
I think somebody should be like the bookkeeper.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,079
I'll be the guy.

176
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,800
If you guys click read along with leader, that checkbox,

177
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,779
then it will bring you with me.

178
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,180
Perfect.

179
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,399
Oh, we have our own little mouses.

180
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,050
Yeah.

181
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,129
So did you see the change page?

182
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:27,689
Yep.

183
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,299
OK, there's room in it for another story.

184
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,820
It's cold.

185
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm stuck here.

186
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,700
Oh, this is you.

187
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,179
Oh, OK.

188
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,759
So you got to read it.

189
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,639
I am.

190
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm trying to think of what I do for a voice for this person.

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,759
OK, like get in character.

192
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,480
Deep breath.

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,919
Have a feel for yourself.

194
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,279
Figure out what you want to sound like.

195
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,980
The audio.

196
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,860
How do I turn the audio down?

197
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,659
All right.

198
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,059
All right.

199
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:55,539
All right.

200
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,740
That's one thing he doesn't know.

201
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,139
Anything.

202
00:08:59,049 --> 00:08:59,450
Anything.

203
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,330
Should it be like a...

204
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:00,970
OK.

205
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,690
Just make it you.

206
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,169
Just be you.

207
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:02,649
Just be you.

208
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,250
Anything to prove I lived, I guess.

209
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:05,690
Not that.

210
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,649
Not that I'm giving up.

211
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,419
Someone will come.

212
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:09,539
Maybe my friends.

213
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:16,059
It's still you.

214
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,259
Oh, I thought this was the narrator.

215
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,539
But all right.

216
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,370
This is how I'd started here in my yandering country.

217
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,850
Something in the woods is very strange.

218
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,759
I don't have any lines.

219
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,059
A line?

220
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,720
Concerned only with the depth and echo of his own thoughts,

221
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,960
a young man named Inan takes the seasonal road to the town of Thunderost.

222
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

223
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,279
His whole character introduction is...

224
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,720
There's something going on in the woods.

225
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,220
Yeah.

226
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,259
OK.

227
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,360
There's a timeless problem.

228
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,480
The stone in the shoe.

229
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,500
When should one bend and remove it?

230
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,200
When is it finally time?

231
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,159
Where's that threshold between discomfort and laziness?

232
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,679
I could write a treatise, probably.

233
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,659
Breeze is light that day.

234
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,460
Birds are timid.

235
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,580
In fact, the whole world is taking a breath, ready to leap in the sea.

236
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm there already, huh?

237
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,159
Here's the hard part.

238
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,679
Getting a longus out of bed.

239
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,690
Or worse, if I have to dislodge him from a book or smoke.

240
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,940
Fluttering flames roost among the far-off rooftops.

241
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,740
Inan hurries towards town, thinking of a longus,

242
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,620
a young man whom he's known since boyhood.

243
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
OK, so now I can choose...

244
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
Wait, you have to choose this?

245
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,320
Yeah.

246
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,059
I can choose to increase my rivalry, my friendship, or some romance.

247
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
Let's do friendship.

248
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,980
If we've known each other all our lives, I doubt we'd be rivals.

249
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,659
He must have tried to cook breakfast again.

250
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:56,379
There we go.

251
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,549
A longus!

252
00:10:58,549 --> 00:10:59,429
You all right?

253
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,269
I'll get you out and just make a little noise.

254
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,759
OK.

255
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,740
Wait, what?

256
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,179
So it looks like my introduction is a burning village,

257
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,899
and I'm going to be in a solo combat situation looking for a longus.

258
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,259
So who is a longus?

259
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:16,980
Is that you, Ster?

260
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,460
That's me.

261
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,059
That's Ster.

262
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,659
So the game has decided that we are childhood friends, just randomly.

263
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,159
OK.

264
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,870
So now you can kind of get a feel for, like, the combat.

265
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,070
This is kind of the combat map, and it's all time-based,

266
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,620
and we all act at the same time, and then the enemies act at the same time.

267
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,059
Oh, so it should go pretty quick.

268
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,659
So this is a longus' house?

269
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,419
Yeah, look.

270
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,399
His house is still standing, at least.

271
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,440
A longus!

272
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,259
Fire right here.

273
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,220
You're not sleeping, are you?

274
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:55,259
What's going on here?

275
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
This is me, a longus.

276
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,700
He doesn't know.

277
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:03,769
Why is no one?

278
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,889
Hey, do you not smell the...

279
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,970
I smell the smoke.

280
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,690
Get inside.

281
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah, my bow.

282
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
The blaze is secondary.

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
It's doom's detail.

284
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,500
A herd of these hideous, afflicted-looking beasts.

285
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,000
Garoo!

286
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,029
They stampeded in.

287
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,750
I managed to trap one behind the house.

288
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,870
Small victory.

289
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,470
Staying in here is not really an option.

290
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:40,330
Right, so.

291
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,210
Here, I've got some tools around.

292
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,570
You're stronger than I am.

293
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,809
You can swing something pretty good.

294
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,649
I bet we can at least drive it off.

295
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,639
Okay, do I grab the pitchfork, the pickaxe, or the frying pan?

296
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm going pickaxe here.

297
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,929
If it breaks stars, it'll break bones.

298
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,220
It can be killed, right?

299
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,940
If we're steady and methodical, we can manage it.

300
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,730
Steady and methodical beating of an animal.

301
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,169
Let's get it done.

302
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,490
I hope it just cuts to me and I've been eaten.

303
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,940
Our first enemy is a roe.

304
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,220
It looks like it's just a deer.

305
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,139
And we're going out the back of the house.

306
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,759
So that's the end of my turn.

307
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,799
I'm out of actions.

308
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,149
You should be in control of your character right now.

309
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,350
Okay, I will get behind you.

310
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,470
Okay.

311
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,350
With my bow.

312
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,149
I'm going to open the door and head out.

313
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,759
Enemy revealed.

314
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,799
Bow card.

315
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,110
That's my turn.

316
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,519
You have a shot?

317
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,159
Nope.

318
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,970
Your come out is going to be really interesting, because you're a wizard.

319
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,889
What you can do is you can like basically like you click on it.

320
00:13:58,889 --> 00:13:59,850
Why did he go in the house?

321
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,330
Get out of my house.

322
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:02,809
Wait, what?

323
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,730
I'm going to strike it.

324
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,179
Oh, it's over there.

325
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,200
Where am I?

326
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,799
Holy shit.

327
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,000
You're so strong.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,879
To get the AI has written out of our story already.

329
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,360
Okay, I leveled up so I can choose one of these three abilities.

330
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,620
That seems cool.

331
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,250
You're leveling up and you're in your room like, oh, I live near the forest.

332
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,529
Yeah, I looked out my window.

333
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,809
That's my whole story arc.

334
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,169
You leveled up as well?

335
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,129
With my level.

336
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:44,629
Everyone's saying you guys gave me the unplugged controller.

337
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,269
You're playing, dude.

338
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:46,549
Trust me, you're playing.

339
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,509
Oh, it's not my turn.

340
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:54,659
Okay.

341
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,179
Did you see that thing?

342
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,500
What could have wrought such a change?

343
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,059
Why did it go in my house?

344
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,500
The creature's death is quiet.

345
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,940
It seems to slip from life in a few stunned and hazy blinks.

346
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,929
Spend a piece of the day getting the flames under control.

347
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,610
The damage isn't as bad as it could have been.

348
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,610
Townsfolk emerge from hiding to fight fires and clear debris.

349
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,289
Some full of curiosity.

350
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,850
Others visibly haunted by what they've seen.

351
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,250
Geez.

352
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,580
We should go.

353
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,700
Thomas is alone.

354
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,220
Unless you think, I mean, I'm not sure who's safer suddenly.

355
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,899
Who the hell is Thomas?

356
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,340
It's like that kid that just sits in his window.

357
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,299
This is you, man.

358
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,379
I changed the line.

359
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:42,940
Oh, okay.

360
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,100
Oh, he did a little bit of improv.

361
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,139
Let's start one out.

362
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,659
Thomas will be waiting for us.

363
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,659
What happened today could be happening everywhere, couldn't it?

364
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,860
Something about that tower is just stuck in my mind.

365
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,840
It's like when you get an apple skin in your teeth.

366
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,799
Oh, some of these.

367
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,889
It unchecked the read-along with leader, I think.

368
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:07,690
Okay.

369
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,429
Are you caught up?

370
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,750
I know the sensation you describe.

371
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,549
Huh?

372
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah.

373
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,080
Anyway, I just think we said we'd meet him, so we should.

374
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,279
The towers and the hills.

375
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:18,919
You've been there?

376
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,860
Yeah, once.

377
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,419
Actually looking at the tracks, they come and they go.

378
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,779
That direction.

379
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,509
Oh, no.

380
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,590
And on and along us follow the pounded path of the monstrous feet,

381
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,269
hoping for the best and dreading every other possibility.

382
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,899
Okay, this is your choice here.

383
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,419
How do you tell who's choosing?

384
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:54,090
Your character is front and center, so it's related to you.

385
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,179
If you have a rivalry with Thomas, a friendship, or maybe a romance.

386
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:58,820
A romance.

387
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,389
Okay.

388
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,940
A worthless while passes between them, but the quiet only heightens their worry.

389
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,779
You've always been a little fond of him, I thought.

390
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:08,339
Of Thomas.

391
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,779
What have I?

392
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,440
You've noticed.

393
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,160
Is that true?

394
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,460
I do find he's grown on me.

395
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,819
Always kind of looking for an angle, a way to get ahead.

396
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,940
He's not mean.

397
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,130
There's just kind of this unapologetic self-interest with him.

398
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,009
That makes me laugh.

399
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:43,539
And plus, it seems like no matter where he goes, we tend to have adventures.

400
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,099
All right.

401
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:44,900
Okay.

402
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,259
So now our next mission is to find Thomas at the tower.

403
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:53,589
It's kind of explained to us that the way we do this is we're going to scout the next area.

404
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,579
And then it takes some travel time.

405
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,500
And then sometimes we can be intercepted on the way,

406
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,180
but most of the time we'll just travel there.

407
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,779
And then we reveal and trigger the next kind of chapter.

408
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:09,500
He's not there.

409
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,410
He said he'd be here on time.

410
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,289
Previous night.

411
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:13,789
Eh?

412
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,210
The tower where Thomas had arranged to meet Inanna and along us

413
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,970
is a place he often used to escape to as a boy.

414
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,940
He knows its rooms and floors so well.

415
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,859
He could survive being chased through them.

416
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,779
And now I wait, I suppose.

417
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:42,150
The dust gets deep as rain puddles in here.

418
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:50,759
Alive is alive until that beast breaks through.

419
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,880
You're a rare beast.

420
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,200
Folks would pay to see you.

421
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,319
I'd pay not to.

422
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,769
The tower is an heirloom of an earlier people.

423
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,250
The locals have lost the legend of it.

424
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,490
The emptiness is deep and fragrant.

425
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,170
The odor of 10,000 rains soaked into the stone.

426
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,980
But as the old will tell you,

427
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,829
precious things go overlooked in a ruin.

428
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,069
But lodges amid the bones of failure

429
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,750
is often the dream that drove it.

430
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,529
What's this over here?

431
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:30,009
That book.

432
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:31,880
Why have I never?

433
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,690
Easy there.

434
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,460
I guess you're wondering why I'm talking to myself,

435
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
beast.

436
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,039
I'm also wondering too.

437
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,940
Thomas bends down.

438
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,460
Don't, it's me doing that.

439
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,779
The books, I was gasping as the audience.

440
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,000
The book's heavier than its slender spine suggests.

441
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,269
It's the game.

442
00:19:59,269 --> 00:19:59,910
It's the game.

443
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,660
It's gone meta.

444
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,539
Look at this.

445
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:07,829
It's full of strange stories.

446
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,549
It's you.

447
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,589
No, no, no.

448
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:10,549
You can, you want to narrate this.

449
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,869
Go on.

450
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:11,109
Go ahead.

451
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,230
Oh, I thought I was reading it.

452
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,589
But no, I, yeah.

453
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,549
Anyone can narrate.

454
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,869
All right.

455
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,150
It's full of strange stories.

456
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,339
The folklore of folk long forgotten.

457
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,779
Candlelight leaping strikes no significant bell.

458
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,900
It's the weird story of a child watching candlelight

459
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,299
against the ceiling and wishing himself through it

460
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,039
to a far realm without grownups.

461
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait, why, how old am I?

462
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,640
What?

463
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,339
Why am I reading this book?

464
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,220
Why do I have this?

465
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,299
Maybe you just, maybe you're an adult

466
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:44,900
and you just want to go where there's no other grownups.

467
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,789
Gift of the Inscriptor proposes an unlikely legend

468
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:57,349
that one spider-limbed woman crafted all written language.

469
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:00,869
She trapped ants between vellum and pressed them so long

470
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:05,450
and relentlessly that they became letters.

471
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,549
Mama Thunder Roast's horn spins the yarn of a mother

472
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,630
who drank so much and laughed so freely

473
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,789
that she grew a beautiful spiral horn.

474
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,440
Her children were very proud.

475
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,279
Huh?

476
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,109
I did that.

477
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,430
This book.

478
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,559
What's happening with this?

479
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,160
There's room in it for another story.

480
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm stuck here.

481
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,529
But all right, this is how I'd start it.

482
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,849
Here in my yondering country.

483
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,849
Thomas writes, words are ready.

484
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,809
Omens have formed in the fabric of everything

485
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:04,970
and he's beginning to recognize them now.

486
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,470
Okay.

487
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,609
Some are just misgivings.

488
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,890
They've crept through his body

489
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,890
like the sourceless aches one wakes with.

490
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:13,130
Others are more substantial.

491
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,930
Now they seem lightning plain, a promise of thunder.

492
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,390
Somebody just called me a theater kid and it made me mad.

493
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,890
Hold on.

494
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,230
Time that person up for five minutes.

495
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,549
From the wild black woods where birds once belled,

496
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,809
a hateful silence churns.

497
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,109
Pain lights Thomas's head.

498
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,680
What?

499
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, I'm fired.

500
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,880
I made it.

501
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,309
He lowers his bleary eyes.

502
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,759
His story lies before him in luminous script.

503
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,240
Empty pages have sprouted behind it.

504
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,740
Why do I feel powerful?

505
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,809
Okay. What do you do?

506
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,170
I pull out a spoon.

507
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,210
Open wide, beast.

508
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,410
I'm getting out of here.

509
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,960
All right.

510
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,039
So this is a, you're fighting a rager.

511
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,279
This is going to be a solo combat for you.

512
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:16,779
Okay.

513
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,009
It charges without seeing.

514
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,089
And you've got actions.

515
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:26,039
I believe you can still cast spells as a wizard with a spoon.

516
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,160
Oh, that's right.

517
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,640
I'm a wizard.

518
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,140
Okay.

519
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,170
Where is this beast?

520
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,210
So you have to see him for him to appear.

521
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,769
I don't know.

522
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,829
Oh wait, attack scenery?

523
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:38,549
Yeah. So what you want to, so what you can do as a wizard

524
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,549
is you can basically imbue a piece of scenery with a spell

525
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:43,990
and then the following turn,

526
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,670
you can throw the thing you imbued at the beast.

527
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,549
So if you imbued a table or a fireplace,

528
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,690
you could throw a flame at the beast on the next turn.

529
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,250
Oh, okay.

530
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,049
So I could.

531
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,730
So you can see how there's like a link

532
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,809
that's attaching you to that scenery now.

533
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,289
Yep.

534
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,250
So you could probably spend your second action moving,

535
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,819
try and get, get eyes on this beast.

536
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,460
Yeah, there you go.

537
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,180
Here it is.

538
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,980
Okay. Now I'm gonna.

539
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,299
Yeah, grab it.

540
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,059
Okay. Wait, I'm throwing the fireplace?

541
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,299
You're going to be throwing the flames.

542
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,599
Oh, fireplace.

543
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,960
I can't reach.

544
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,839
All right. I'm just going to move.

545
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,359
I mean, this time you can just, you can move

546
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,440
or you can just end turn and you can let him approach.

547
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,150
Yeah. I'm going to get up here.

548
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,029
All right. There you are.

549
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,069
All right. Now let's, let's discuss that.

550
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,099
I'm wondering if.

551
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:41,980
Yeah, I have no idea.

552
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,660
Oh, okay. So it has to be within these tiles.

553
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,380
Yeah.

554
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,089
So I think I could just, how do I get over to the beast?

555
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,650
I think it's trying to get you to throw the bookcase at it

556
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,579
or something.

557
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,099
Can you, you can't target it.

558
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,140
Can you through the rubble?

559
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,339
I don't think so.

560
00:24:58,339 --> 00:24:59,720
Maybe it's just end turn.

561
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,220
Well, yeah, maybe in turn and see how he approaches.

562
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,500
All right. He's trying to break through.

563
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
Yeah. Can you imbue the,

564
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,759
maybe you can imbue the rubble in front of you.

565
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,599
I think I just, can I burn this?

566
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,720
I just stole the fire.

567
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:18,839
Possibly.

568
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,049
Let me see if I can burn it.

569
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,950
Okay. Fire, steel fire.

570
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,829
Oh, maybe if you infuse something on his side,

571
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:28,950
like the bookshelf.

572
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,410
I can't target anything across this.

573
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,250
Should I start breaking shit?

574
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,529
Yeah. Just start breaking shit.

575
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:44,869
He's going out the door. I think.

576
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:45,509
All right. Hold on.

577
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:47,430
Break the rubble behind you maybe,

578
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,349
or infuse it and then throw it.

579
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,160
What does withdraw?

580
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,099
Stop. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

581
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,980
I'm going to stop using this and let's, ah, here we go.

582
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,019
All right. I'm going to use the paper's table back here.

583
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,059
There it is.

584
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,940
Oh, good idea.

585
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,980
Then splinter blast him with it.

586
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,579
Yeah. Splinter blast. There you go.

587
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,789
All right. I get it. Let's go.

588
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,099
Oh, nice. Okay.

589
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:13,980
The same deal.

590
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,779
Down again. Same deal. Infuse something nearby.

591
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,799
Candles. And I'm going to,

592
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,519
oh, let's just light the room up.

593
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,440
Okay. I guess I'm done.

594
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,039
I guess I've lit the fire.

595
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,529
That's cozy.

596
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,180
Okay. Now if I can blow up,

597
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,220
I'm going to blow up the bookcase.

598
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:42,660
There we go. All right. See you later.

599
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,640
Look at that. Nice.

600
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,140
Okay. And Thomas, I think Thomas is going to level up.

601
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,619
There we go.

602
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,420
Ooh.

603
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,099
You can choose from these three abilities.

604
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:56,059
And so read through them,

605
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:57,980
see which one kind of you like the look of.

606
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:04,009
Elementalist, ignite or open mind.

607
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,569
Thomas can interfuse with one additional target.

608
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:09,829
That means you can link two targets at once.

609
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,190
Instead of just like the bookshelf,

610
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,710
you could do a bookshelf and a table.

611
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:15,299
I don't know.

612
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,970
Elementalist, what that kind of does

613
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,009
is it improves the things you interact with.

614
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,250
So if you interact with fire, it won't burn out.

615
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,130
If you interact with wood,

616
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,569
you get something called splinter salvo,

617
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,650
which is like a better version of what you just did.

618
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:30,730
I think, I think open mind.

619
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,250
I like having, I want to infuse with more stuff.

620
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:33,529
Cool. All right.

621
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:41,000
Ooh. And I got a, you got a amulet there,

622
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,039
a strap of golden links.

623
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,839
Everyone knows who's winning.

624
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,920
When you show up wearing this, it gives you bonus damage.

625
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,759
So you can just click your empty slot

626
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,880
and you can equip that.

627
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, nice. All right. Cool.

628
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,680
0.7 bonus damage.

629
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
This is pretty neat. I like this.

630
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
This is fun.

631
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
More monsters roam the battle halls

632
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,240
and rattle the rotting furniture.

633
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,599
But Thomas moves quietly, sensing his way in the dark.

634
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,359
Oh, you're already dressed like a wizard.

635
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,440
Daylight lands on his wrist.

636
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Cool wind soothes his tired eyes.

637
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,329
I'm still allowed to live?

638
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,559
He closes the tower door gently to make no noise.

639
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,900
That was the mystic's art that I did.

640
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,700
Right, tower?

641
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,299
Where'd I get it from?

642
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,019
Could it have just happened?

643
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,410
Is it just one of those things?

644
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,940
Things a man's born with

645
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,500
that might blossom in his life when he needs them.

646
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,930
Well, I might not deserve it,

647
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,609
but you never turn down a turkey.

648
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:40,809
So they say.

649
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:41,529
I'm sorry.

650
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,420
That guy calling you a theater kid

651
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,259
is still Red Freak in my head.

652
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,220
Well, who never turns?

653
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,660
What if we never turn down a turkey?

654
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,009
You don't.

655
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,650
I bet this is you, Stan.

656
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,599
Thomas.

657
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:00,789
I should plumb the depths of this power,

658
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,630
but safely, I suppose, and out of sight.

659
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,150
I don't want anyone to know that I'm a magician.

660
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:05,289
Thomas.

661
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,950
You're okay.

662
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,589
You're okay.

663
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,430
You look like it.

664
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:13,299
Hey, Thomas, something happened.

665
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,140
And along us, you're here and you're safe.

666
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,640
Good.

667
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,900
Oh, sorry.

668
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,380
And you, too.

669
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:20,900
Is it how do I pronounce it?

670
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:21,940
Inon.

671
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,440
Inon.

672
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:28,380
Inon and I only barely made it.

673
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,690
Yeah, see that smoke on the horizon?

674
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,569
That's from the town.

675
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,430
Yeah, that's thunder roast.

676
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:36,859
It burned?

677
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,619
Things are different than they were.

678
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,720
Are they?

679
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,130
Yeah.

680
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,289
Well, I don't know if you've ever seen something quite like this.

681
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,119
A monster.

682
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,799
Sure, we have.

683
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,799
Yeah, we slay monsters.

684
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:03,380
Oh, good.

685
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,460
I'm glad you're okay.

686
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,900
Well, I do magic.

687
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,339
Yeah, I know.

688
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,420
We're childhood friends, apparently.

689
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,640
And our party has been formed.

690
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
So we've discovered a new site.

691
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,559
So you can see in the region of the Arnie Vigil,

692
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,319
you can see that sword banner.

693
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,400
And that means that there is a battle to be had.

694
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,839
Ooh, a battle.

695
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, so let's do it.

696
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,900
I do magic.

697
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,940
Is there any information that might be pertinent?

698
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:47,210
Someone else narrate for a bit.

699
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,089
A perfect understanding isn't likely to emerge.

700
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,250
What these beasts are, where they came from,

701
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,890
and what drove them to attack the town of thunder roast.

702
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,269
But letting them nest here feels like the wrong idea.

703
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,390
By the way, sorry, I thought that said chatter in the lower left, not clatter.

704
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,250
So I was doing like, sorry, that's my bad.

705
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,369
Do we fan out, get aggressive, or maximize our defense?

706
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,940
Stay tight?

707
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,059
Sure, well.

708
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:20,950
Okay, so either Ster can choose Icarus as a suggestion,

709
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,019
or Jemma can choose Stoicism.

710
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,059
What? What?

711
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:27,380
Like, I mean, one is him and one is me.

712
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,539
This is one of the things where we just kind of decide as a group.

713
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,460
It's like, how do we want to approach this combat?

714
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,740
I guess we discuss.

715
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,769
Back in my house, it was pretty simple.

716
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,170
It ran in, and we hit it one time.

717
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,710
Or let them come to us.

718
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,490
I just came out of there.

719
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:48,839
If we're methodical, patient, we can fan them off at least.

720
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,079
No, he overpowered you.

721
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,440
I know what's best here.

722
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,400
Our modifier, we all get plus two damage.

723
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,420
Okay.

724
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,960
We have raccoons and roe as our foe cards.

725
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:06,490
All right, I guess I'm the tank, I think.

726
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,539
So I'll approach the door.

727
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:10,660
Okay, I'm going to.

728
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,339
Oh, we can move on our own move at the same time.

729
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:14,819
Yeah.

730
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,380
All right, I'll just stay in the back.

731
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,380
I'm going to I'm going to get a fuse ready here on the tree.

732
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,460
Just in case I'm going to imagine they're going to be lured out potentially.

733
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,369
Courage, Thomas.

734
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:32,329
Courage.

735
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:34,619
We must move forward.

736
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,220
But not me first.

737
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,579
And on.

738
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:42,299
I mean, I'm not I'm very squishy, so I'm not going to get in there.

739
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,950
Once you've used up your two action points, you want to just end time.

740
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,670
Oh, there it is.

741
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:52,710
You almost killed him in one hit.

742
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,450
I had sentinel, which is like an inception.

743
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:03,220
I will rush the raccoon.

744
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:04,819
Okay.

745
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:05,220
I guess.

746
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,660
I'm going to.

747
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,180
I'm coming in.

748
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,980
I'm just going to come in.

749
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,099
That's a good thing we got, Thomas.

750
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,190
All right.

751
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,990
That was good support.

752
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:32,230
Great work, everybody.

753
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,549
There's a little tutorial fight that we did.

754
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,190
Great, everyone.

755
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,640
Okay, we found Hunter's armor.

756
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,720
Armored two, warding one.

757
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,839
Town watchers who are good with a bow and who can't get anything fancy

758
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,160
have long traded to each other the secrets of Graybark.

759
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,720
This is an upgrade for along us.

760
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,160
Okay.

761
00:33:53,609 --> 00:34:00,970
The misshapen creature folds its bones and dimes in a nice little neat pile.

762
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,289
Blue fluids darken the dust.

763
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:04,920
A sick.

764
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,200
Fascinating.

765
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,599
Grim.

766
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,519
The color in their veins.

767
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,320
What does it mean?

768
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,420
A sickness, probably.

769
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,329
Today is put reality in a spiral.

770
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:17,980
Yeah.

771
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,929
Day day drops, day rises.

772
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,969
Dusk is sweet.

773
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,650
The sunrise sweeter.

774
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,010
It's not long before they've cleaned the old tower up a bit.

775
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,869
There's still a thousand questions in this place.

776
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:33,429
Excites.

777
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,230
Even the oldest books say very little of what we've seen.

778
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:40,230
Monsters come from myths.

779
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,429
But where do myths come from?

780
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,429
I suppose we'll learn.

781
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,150
They're real now.

782
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,550
Let's not wait to be overrun.

783
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,389
We're a company of heroes now.

784
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,190
We'll walk the land.

785
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,150
We'll fight.

786
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,869
People need us.

787
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,829
We'll give ourselves a name and make sure it's one they'll sing.

788
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,230
Sounds like you've thought about this.

789
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,429
Name of the bands for cunts.

790
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,949
We name our company.

791
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:05,510
So my character suggestion is the Queer Crown.

792
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,710
Walkers of the Queer Crown.

793
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,579
Ster's suggestion is the Bats of the Fabulous Four.

794
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,300
And Jerma's suggestion is the Family of the Golden Romance.

795
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:14,980
Okay.

796
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:16,820
The family of the...

797
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,260
These are all our fault.

798
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:19,699
Yeah, yeah.

799
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,059
I don't think we're allowed to enter our own name.

800
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,980
I think we have to pick from our three.

801
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, the Bats of the Fabulous Four.

802
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,260
I think that's my favorite.

803
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,780
I like that because there's three of us.

804
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
Yeah, because there's not four people.

805
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,280
Let's do that.

806
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,809
After that, the three of them are inseparable.

807
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,929
Rumors are rampant.

808
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,050
Heroes are needed.

809
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,289
This world will be flooded in sorrows.

810
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,010
But its defenders are joined by a fire that night.

811
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,500
Here follow the tales of the Bats of the Fabulous Four.

812
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,460
Be remembered.

813
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:53,659
That's us.

814
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,260
Anime outro.

815
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,300
The game has crashed.

816
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,420
Please send your logs.

817
00:35:58,619 --> 00:35:59,500
Oh, no.

818
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,059
What?

819
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,260
Yeah, my game crashed.

820
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,780
That's an interesting prompt.

821
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:06,840
Wait.

822
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,039
No, I'm still here.

823
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:08,820
Oh, you're here.

824
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,139
You're good.

825
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:09,380
Am I?

826
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,579
Hold on.

827
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,429
I think I'm seeing a card of a raccoon on the screen.

828
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:15,909
Oh, yep.

829
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:16,309
I can see it.

830
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:17,429
We're good.

831
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:17,750
Yeah, we're good.

832
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,230
We're good.

833
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,829
The way the combat system works is the longer our campaign goes,

834
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,309
we'll add more monster cards to the debt list of calamities.

835
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,909
And what that means is these monsters will...

836
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:28,789
There'll be new monsters.

837
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:29,590
They'll get tougher.

838
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,670
We'll encounter new things.

839
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:37,110
And so the longer we survive, the more the calamities of the world will grow.

840
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,510
Really?

841
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,750
Okay.

842
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,590
Right now, all we have is feral raccoons.

843
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,630
So we're the problem?

844
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:41,909
Yes.

845
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,030
So we have some choices here.

846
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,110
We have some land around us.

847
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,869
We have cloudy birch wilds.

848
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:49,989
We have gruff demon woods.

849
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,110
We have the demon wilds.

850
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,630
We have the humboldton beaches.

851
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:57,110
Two of these require us to build a bridge to reach.

852
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,789
The other two, we can just kind of walk there and kind of scout the area.

853
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,539
So where would you guys like to go?

854
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:06,579
What kind of sings to you?

855
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,539
Okay.

856
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:11,460
We got the humble demon, the demon wilds.

857
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,659
Yeah.

858
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:13,219
Rough demon.

859
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:13,860
Wild demons.

860
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,019
Yeah.

861
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,219
Wild demons going on.

862
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,760
The cloudy birch wild seems like the least demon-y place.

863
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,210
What do you guys think?

864
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:27,429
I think cloudy birch would be the safe play.

865
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,340
It sounds nice.

866
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,219
Yeah, it sounds nice.

867
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,659
What's wrong with my background?

868
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,500
What's wrong with my walls?

869
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,780
What do you mean?

870
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,820
It's like holding it.

871
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,860
You've been punching it again.

872
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,980
Yeah, you want a green screen?

873
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,460
No, no.

874
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,460
I think it's because you're seeing light come through the window.

875
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,059
Wait, did that say 23 days?

876
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:52,380
Yeah.

877
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,820
So the time is passing in real time.

878
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,380
You can see at the top, year one, spring, day 10, 11, 12, etc.

879
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,940
We killed a raccoon and we're like, we're adventurers now.

880
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,820
30 days.

881
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,619
Let's go.

882
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,500
So we've revealed the cloudy birch wilds and it looks like

883
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,219
there is a battle here to be had.

884
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,489
Okay, assault moose landing stone.

885
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,920
I have to be honest.

886
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,599
I'm glad it's you cooking tonight along us.

887
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,650
My feet are so tired that my hands are starting to feel it.

888
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:27,690
Don't get too excited.

889
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,429
It got excited.

890
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,710
So we'll hit moose landing stone tomorrow morning.

891
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,670
But that detour added more time than we thought it would

892
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,510
and our food is running a little low.

893
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,940
How low?

894
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,880
I've got onions and some more onions.

895
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,239
I still thought it was jerky.

896
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,500
I figured we'd need that tomorrow.

897
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,820
What?

898
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,809
Onions aren't a meal, they're an ingredient.

899
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,460
Okay, so we can either bet on me catching a fish 30% chance

900
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,420
or along us changing my mind and cooking an excellent onion

901
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,860
meal, which is a 51% chance to succeed.

902
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,340
Thomas, you settle this.

903
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,019
Should I cook or should he go fish?

904
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,380
Yeah, I think that's a good way to do it.

905
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,820
The person not involved gets a pick.

906
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,559
I think that what we should really do is I'd like to see if you can change his mind.

907
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:38,760
I feel like onions could actually be a meal if you put them into an onion soup

908
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,480
and make a broth and make it salty and put a little bit of cheese on it.

909
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,300
Let's do it.

910
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,539
A good onion soup can hold its own against any other meal.

911
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:49,579
Low and slow.

912
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,739
That's the key.

913
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,829
How slow?

914
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,469
Start thinking of stories now.

915
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:04,789
The version they tell in Cloudy Birch's Wilds differs in one key way, you see,

916
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:10,070
because of the agricultural significance of the later.

917
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,989
And as I was astounded, there it was in the original document.

918
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:14,550
Document?

919
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,730
Even later than that.

920
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,190
So how much longer do you think?

921
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,199
They're not doing what I wanted them to do.

922
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,820
I'm not sure if it's salvageable at this point.

923
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,059
Sorry about the onion mush.

924
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,199
What did you even do?

925
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
No, it's good.

926
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,809
It's OK.

927
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:39,289
You're right.

928
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,170
It's disgusting.

929
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,449
But thanks for trying.

930
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:47,099
You shall soon come to learn the tragic extent of my failings.

931
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:47,420
All right.

932
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,840
We had a terrible onion soup and then we got attacked by enemies.

933
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,039
Oh, shit.

934
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:58,760
All right.

935
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,840
They're in here.

936
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,039
Yeah, most likely.

937
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,199
I remember when we did this a month ago.

938
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,250
Different times.

939
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,219
I'm pretty sure same tower.

940
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,619
Quite not.

941
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:13,179
Where are they?

942
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,539
There's three monsters in here.

943
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,190
They're going to be in the back rooms, probably.

944
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,840
Looks like Thomas go off on his own.

945
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,260
I'm opening this door.

946
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,820
Nothing in here.

947
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:30,630
Oh, God.

948
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,429
What?

949
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,309
Oh, shit.

950
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:33,829
I just started blasting.

951
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:34,150
Hold on.

952
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,550
Wait, wait, wait.

953
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,030
Oh, I'm coming.

954
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,670
I'm coming.

955
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,610
Can I blast through the wall?

956
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,420
Probably.

957
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,400
Oh, God.

958
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:49,530
Oh, shit.

959
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,769
Oh, oh, it hurts.

960
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:52,409
Oh, watch out.

961
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:52,809
Watch out.

962
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:53,769
I'm going to throw a fireball.

963
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,659
One eye goes dark like a candle prematurely snuffed.

964
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,579
And then fights the sensation that he's swimming.

965
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,940
Fights to stay on his feet.

966
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,019
So I can choose to just die.

967
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,539
Dealing 12 damage to the enemies.

968
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,940
Or I can choose to fight on.

969
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,219
But I will get minus 15 accuracy for the rest of the campaign.

970
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,909
That's rough.

971
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,590
Two of us get through life unscathed.

972
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,789
Now's no time to give up.

973
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,420
I've lost an eye.

974
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,019
And then feels his way back to safety.

975
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,619
There's so much that he has to live for.

976
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:25,579
So much ahead of him.

977
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:27,099
If he can make it through today.

978
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:29,739
An eye patch might add a dash of mystique to my look.

979
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:31,099
I literally lost an eye.

980
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:33,739
Can you imagine saying that while getting attacked?

981
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:34,699
Your eye pops out.

982
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:36,539
Oh, an eye patch might add mystique.

983
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:39,820
And your stomach hurts from gross onion mush.

984
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,980
You guys are going to have to deal with this.

985
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,780
Now I'm gone.

986
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,019
All right.

987
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:47,019
I think let me tell you something along us.

988
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:48,780
I'm going to torch this room.

989
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,460
I just want to make sure you understand.

990
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,699
My eyes just went flame, right?

991
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:53,500
And everyone's like, oh, my God.

992
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,019
He's going to use his powers finally.

993
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,699
It's been like 45 minutes into the movie.

994
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,900
And everyone knows I'm going to hear it comes.

995
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,539
Here comes the powers.

996
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,179
OK, so he's going to infuse that clothing rack

997
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,940
and throw a t-shirt at the deer.

998
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,940
So wait, do we do I have to hit done?

999
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:14,739
No, this is a fresh turn.

1000
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:15,539
You've got two actions.

1001
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:17,300
Why are you dead?

1002
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:21,610
He fucking says I came out three enemies and my eye came out.

1003
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,449
But you're on the screen anymore.

1004
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:25,050
I don't think you want to move up on that.

1005
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,449
Yeah, Thomas, Thomas, do not run up there.

1006
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:29,449
I'm not going to but you have no armor.

1007
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,329
All right.

1008
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:32,409
You see the you see the mannequins up here on the right?

1009
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,409
Yeah, those have been infused.

1010
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:35,849
What we're going to do is we're going to pull them back

1011
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:39,289
and then I'm going to back and you're talking character, boy.

1012
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,889
OK, flame eyes.

1013
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,920
Stand back along us.

1014
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,960
I'll handle this.

1015
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
You step back, pull them through.

1016
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:56,090
I'm pulling, I'm pulling and your turn when you're ready, though.

1017
00:43:56,889 --> 00:44:02,420
OK, push through aggressively.

1018
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,800
Step back.

1019
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:11,690
No, OK, flair.

1020
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,119
They're blinded.

1021
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:21,400
Uh, they will miss their next attack.

1022
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,679
You might want to line of sight the raccoon, though, like get away.

1023
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,980
You might be right.

1024
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:34,110
So you are you're ranged.

1025
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:34,610
Oh, sorry.

1026
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:36,510
Can you use that bow?

1027
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:40,699
My special ability, thunder shot.

1028
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:44,909
Got him.

1029
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,489
That's a good thing that that all that books and clothes was there.

1030
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:56,139
OK.

1031
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,800
What do I want to do here?

1032
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:03,210
Constriction power.

1033
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,690
You blocked it.

1034
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,139
Can you still move, pal?

1035
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:12,599
Maybe you get outside slow and methodical, like you used to say.

1036
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,690
I can't move.

1037
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,170
I just tried.

1038
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:16,889
I did my I did.

1039
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:17,849
I used my power.

1040
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,119
Nice shot.

1041
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,530
I've got plenty of cover here.

1042
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,469
I'm still infused.

1043
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:36,409
Oh, should we go hide in this room?

1044
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:37,449
We should probably hide in the other room.

1045
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:38,170
Oh, you're going in.

1046
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,289
OK, I'm going to come in with you.

1047
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:42,090
My secret ability, silk step.

1048
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1049
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,480
What?

1050
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,119
How does this work?

1051
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,239
Hold on.

1052
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:50,360
I'm reading my special duty.

1053
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:53,079
Oh, check this out.

1054
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:06,400
Can you kill it?

1055
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,960
Good block.

1056
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,130
I can't believe he's blocked twice and I'm the tank and I just lost an eye.

1057
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:13,820
I'm confused.

1058
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,150
So except supposed to make me hidden.

1059
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,750
But then it also told me to move.

1060
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,369
I don't know how the ability is worth.

1061
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:24,409
Great job, Thomas.

1062
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,130
Let's find that.

1063
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,570
I let you have an eye patch.

1064
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,070
Look.

1065
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:28,809
Oh, you do have an eye patch.

1066
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:29,309
That's funny.

1067
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,340
OK, we got the lizard beam spear.

1068
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:40,110
I think I will replace my pickaxe with that.

1069
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:46,860
Sure, you can handle a spear with one eye.

1070
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,219
It's kind of a precise weapon.

1071
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,480
Oh, I get to name the item.

1072
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,119
So that's five damage, right?

1073
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,110
That definitely should go to you.

1074
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:01,949
And then we have a ring.

1075
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,389
Warding, which is plus eight zero point warding.

1076
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,630
That's magic magic armor.

1077
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:12,219
The way gear works is if you hover over the empty slot for everyone,

1078
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:15,820
it will tell you the warding will go up from two point one to two point nine.

1079
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,179
So every value of one is like an upgrade.

1080
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:21,900
It says it absorbs magic damage in on.

1081
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,940
You should take it.

1082
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,500
You're mine.

1083
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,139
You're tanking.

1084
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,539
Yeah, I'll grab it.

1085
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,159
Yeah, my way through hell, my friend.

1086
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,000
And the thought of you trekking back in this state is unacceptable.

1087
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,480
I'm going to make you some onion soup.

1088
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,079
Blue.

1089
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:45,880
Good.

1090
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,679
You're still here.

1091
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,329
All right.

1092
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,289
Who wants to play Luke?

1093
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:49,929
This is a new cat.

1094
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:51,050
Wait, is this a new character?

1095
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,530
I just introducing us to an MPC.

1096
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:53,769
OK.

1097
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:54,170
Hello.

1098
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,550
And on this is Luke.

1099
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,309
She's headed back out of here.

1100
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:05,469
And I've arranged a slight detour for her to give you a lift back to town.

1101
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,590
It's just an eye, mate.

1102
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:08,030
Arranged.

1103
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,550
You mean you bombardo is some arsenal of reasons.

1104
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,909
They were extremely solid reasons.

1105
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:16,719
Huh.

1106
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:18,110
What?

1107
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,449
Just feels weird getting special treatment.

1108
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,320
Then think of it as balancing the scales a bit.

1109
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:32,460
You were in front of death's door not that long ago.

1110
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,980
It's time to enjoy the good fortune where you can find it.

1111
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:40,380
Take care as long as you need.

1112
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,820
I mean, you're sending me away.

1113
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,699
I've been sent away.

1114
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,219
So in our first fight, I died, lost an eye,

1115
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:48,460
and now you're sending me away to like a home.

1116
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,340
What is happening to you?

1117
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,980
You're just getting a nice tree tops passing by the bump in that ox smell.

1118
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,179
What?

1119
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:57,579
What?

1120
00:48:57,579 --> 00:48:58,059
What?

1121
00:48:58,059 --> 00:48:59,739
Enemies improve their strategy.

1122
00:48:59,739 --> 00:48:59,980
OK.

1123
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,579
So they've added the deer are now corrupted and they leave trails of corruption when they move.

1124
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:06,059
Oh, no.

1125
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:08,360
OK.

1126
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,469
So I am.

1127
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:13,070
You're legit gone.

1128
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,670
Yeah, I am maimed and it will take me some time to heal.

1129
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,829
So you guys are going to have to travel ahead of me.

1130
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:19,469
Oh, no.

1131
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,190
Next place.

1132
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,630
Wait, we're turning back to thunder roast on a wagon.

1133
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,070
Why are we going the other way?

1134
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,110
Why are you back with you?

1135
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,309
Why did we send you back?

1136
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:28,909
Because I mean, I'm wounded.

1137
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:29,789
I lost an eye, guys.

1138
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:31,389
Well, we could go back with you.

1139
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:33,070
No, it's you chose not to.

1140
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:33,949
That's OK.

1141
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:38,380
Painted by the amber by painted amber by the fading light,

1142
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,860
a formation of stone catches a long as his eye.

1143
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,880
You think something's up there?

1144
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:54,889
You never know what you'll find until you look upon the hill summit.

1145
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:56,840
Nothing.

1146
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,639
Turns out your eyesight is shit.

1147
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,690
The decent view, at least.

1148
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,340
Look, you can see the salt road.

1149
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,699
Oh, far in the distance.

1150
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,780
I think that's our friend going back to town.

1151
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,079
What's happening?

1152
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:13,800
A thrumming.

1153
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,280
What's that?

1154
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,920
It grows louder, a rumbling.

1155
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,440
Well, and louder until the stone underfoot shatters and shakes.

1156
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,119
It grows louder, even more.

1157
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:27,679
Very loud.

1158
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,440
Oh, it's so loud.

1159
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:32,349
OK.

1160
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:34,829
The mighty growl, calamorous, was thundering.

1161
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,130
And that resolves.

1162
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,630
OK.

1163
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:38,750
OK.

1164
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,130
That was weird.

1165
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,489
That was close.

1166
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:43,289
Oh, hold me.

1167
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:47,050
Maybe we shouldn't have took all those drugs 20 minutes ago.

1168
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,449
Probably a bad idea.

1169
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:50,010
Corruption.

1170
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:52,280
A voice.

1171
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:54,590
I.

1172
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:01,260
The voice of a carnivore cunning and crooning,

1173
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,219
warning them to run, promising to give chase.

1174
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:08,989
The one you have hunted so long.

1175
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:12,829
In my dreams at night, I would think of this animal.

1176
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:17,260
Through cups and riddles.

1177
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,300
That doesn't sound right.

1178
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:27,599
You have hunted so long for me and for a brotherhood that should be yours.

1179
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:31,119
Wait, can I go back?

1180
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
Do you see your face, Thomas?

1181
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:36,659
Yeah.

1182
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,000
I like know what's going on.

1183
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,079
You're tripping.

1184
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,489
I'm like, do you know my name?

1185
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,440
Her name.

1186
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,389
It was the gift I gave to your ancestors.

1187
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:54,269
Thomas is still tripping.

1188
00:51:55,789 --> 00:52:02,670
They walked my myth over Greenfield and Fallow to the curves and corners of being they walked.

1189
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:07,179
Do you know my name?

1190
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,500
Uh, how would I?

1191
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:17,659
A blessing heard through ancient service, an oath written in the steps and trails

1192
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,900
and sealed with a name.

1193
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:22,860
You need only to know it.

1194
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,380
I'll ask you once more.

1195
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,659
We don't know your name.

1196
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,420
We don't know your name.

1197
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,659
Do you know my name?

1198
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:36,679
Lot I, yes.

1199
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,949
I hope that's right.

1200
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,880
It's like reading a fairy tale from your childhood only to realize how disturbing it is.

1201
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,880
The Longest doesn't like knowing the name, but he's sure it's right.

1202
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,320
Sorry.

1203
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,519
Yes, I am lock chaos, your wolf God.

1204
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:11,480
And now you may take my oath, abandon your humanity, my boy, and be blessed as wolf kind.

1205
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,280
Oh, yes.

1206
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,119
I always knew that I was different somehow.

1207
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,960
A furry perhaps.

1208
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:24,219
It feels like coming home, taking oath along us.

1209
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:30,300
No, I'm going home along us, kneels and beneath him a green light pools.

1210
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,900
Dandelions rise yellow out of the sparse wind scraped dirt.

1211
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,739
They grow old and white, throw their seeds and then wilt to nothing.

1212
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:41,849
The God rock he kneels upon hums.

1213
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,769
It cracks somewhere inside.

1214
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:52,409
A geode of understanding splits and catches light beneath the earth and behind his eyes.

1215
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:53,130
Mildly.

1216
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:59,210
Somebody like took a picture of you to flash on in like a bar late at night.

1217
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:05,360
We're going to get the anamorphs transition along us.

1218
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,199
Plus forward time and age.

1219
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:21,480
You have human arms.

1220
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,719
You just have a wolf.

1221
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,159
You have a wolf head.

1222
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,039
That's it, man.

1223
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,519
When when I next see you, I'm going to be very confused.

1224
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:30,380
Oh, no.

1225
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,849
Okay.

1226
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:39,000
So what we can do is you can head back to moose landing and you can secure it.

1227
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
And that will give us like a source of income.

1228
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,920
Are we able to station here earn resources?

1229
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,119
Yeah.

1230
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,119
So we can you want to build a station in Pinewood?

1231
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,159
That's a good.

1232
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:51,840
I'm running around chasing squirrels.

1233
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,280
What does Thomas do?

1234
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,079
Okay.

1235
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:54,579
Okay.

1236
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:59,449
Oh, no, I this is going to and you chose this fate.

1237
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:00,650
So you have to stick with it.

1238
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,460
Wait, do I have a laboring?

1239
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,260
God damn it.

1240
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,050
You have to you have to go all out.

1241
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,489
But you know, you could do the wolf from every major RPG.

1242
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:15,230
And that's just like this talk.

1243
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:19,469
Just like this with a little bit of a little, you know, you don't really care that much.

1244
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,510
Labor intensive, but practical in the long run.

1245
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,670
I don't know how I got this accent.

1246
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,400
Should we lend a hand?

1247
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,360
I'm going Batman.

1248
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,539
Cowlings of sleeping top have been dreaming of building a new threshery or lumber yard.

1249
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,860
The wild folk want to restore the woodland altar.

1250
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,219
Okay, so we can spend one of our legacy points, which we get, we got a bunch for each campaign.

1251
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:46,300
We can have a build a threshery, which will provide us with wooden fabric or a lumber wood.

1252
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,460
The lumber yard will provide us to wood and a primal altar will give us hides and spell threads.

1253
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,219
And all this stuff can be used at the end of each chapter to craft new gear for us.

1254
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:54,719
Hmm.

1255
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,539
I mean, I'm going to vote for the, uh, for the spell threads because I mean,

1256
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:03,739
if you saw on the land, the previous battle, my, uh, my flames were very, very effective.

1257
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:05,579
Three damage each at least.

1258
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:08,670
Okay. Well, it's going to take 25 days to complete.

1259
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,230
Get to work.

1260
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:10,829
25 days?

1261
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,829
I'm healing all the while.

1262
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:13,789
Oh, okay. Good.

1263
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:15,150
Inan has returned.

1264
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,869
Okay. So while you guys are doing that, I will go to moon's landing and meet you there.

1265
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:20,909
Moose landing.

1266
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:21,409
Okay.

1267
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,289
There are studies must be comprehensive and meticulous.

1268
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:27,809
I'm up to it.

1269
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,289
If no one else is.

1270
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:33,250
I'm so glad I'm not the wolf character and you are.

1271
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,409
We can invest, we can investigate thoroughly to find a new item.

1272
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:40,610
We can prioritize speed for like crafting stuff.

1273
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,719
I think we find an item here.

1274
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:43,840
Yeah, I agree.

1275
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,840
Okay. Let's do an item.

1276
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:47,840
So this is my job.

1277
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,800
I will head there and find an item while you guys build that place.

1278
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,300
Cool.

1279
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,380
Uh, alter dedicated longhorn alter now produces hides and spell threads.

1280
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,059
So you guys can probably come and meet me if you want.

1281
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,139
Yeah. Do we have to do anything else with, with this or is this just stays here?

1282
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:05,099
No, it's, it's all done.

1283
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,500
Yeah. That'll, that'll be, that's good.

1284
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,380
All right, let's head over there.

1285
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,150
Okay. So now we just want to stay here and see this through.

1286
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:19,309
I think we see this through.

1287
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,340
If it's going to be adjacent to our altar over there, right?

1288
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,940
Yeah. I think we should make sure it's secured.

1289
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,630
Someone paused.

1290
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:37,760
Uh, infants infestations increase the strength of the source threat.

1291
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,000
Can ambush groups of two or one heroes.

1292
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,199
It's dangerous out there.

1293
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,639
Don't travel alone or split the party at every opportunity.

1294
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:48,320
Hmm. Okay.

1295
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,000
We're going to take the source out.

1296
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,159
All right.

1297
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,079
A thorough delving through the mysterious mysteries of the moose laying stone has

1298
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,199
proven rewarding.

1299
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:04,159
Which strikes me how much this is defined to know.

1300
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,719
I can't believe I haven't reacted to your wolf head.

1301
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:06,880
Yeah.

1302
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,360
Moose landing stone will return to the hands of the common folk.

1303
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,199
And while they tend it, this site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.

1304
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,559
When will he notice me?

1305
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,000
Do we want, uh, hides ingots or spell threads?

1306
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,800
I say ingots like a bit of steel.

1307
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,599
I think it's useful for everybody.

1308
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,480
I think that's a good idea.

1309
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,280
Okay. Oh, we get, we actually just get all three.

1310
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,559
Oh, we get it all. Cool.

1311
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:28,960
All right.

1312
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,000
Who's still reading?

1313
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,480
Oh, there we go.

1314
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:34,670
Okay.

1315
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:39,469
We unlocked a sash, um, which is a plus six stunt chance.

1316
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:41,969
Stunt.

1317
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:44,030
Stunt.

1318
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,829
That's like a crit.

1319
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:47,789
Is it sounds like, yeah, it feels, I don't know, but I know you grow over it.

1320
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:48,670
It doesn't even make sense.

1321
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:53,550
Then percentage chance that attacks will inflict additional damage and stunt effects.

1322
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,630
Oh, I think that's probably a wizard thing.

1323
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,269
It's crit.

1324
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:56,750
Oh, okay.

1325
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:56,909
Yeah.

1326
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:57,949
It's creating.

1327
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:01,170
Is it spell crit or is it just regular attacks?

1328
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,969
So I would assume not spells unless everything's an attack, but I don't.

1329
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:05,409
Oh, really?

1330
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,699
Attacks.

1331
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:06,940
I don't know.

1332
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,219
I think spells are an attack.

1333
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:09,420
Yeah.

1334
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,420
People saying ranger or mage would be a good choice.

1335
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,260
So either of you guys, let's, let's give it to long.

1336
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,300
That's cause he doesn't have anything yet.

1337
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,099
I don't think.

1338
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:15,420
Ooh.

1339
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:18,239
I mean, I did become a wolf.

1340
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,119
That is a thing.

1341
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:19,360
Yeah.

1342
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:22,320
You should be the ranged crit guy.

1343
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,079
But Thomas already has a, yeah.

1344
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,360
We got you the silk threads.

1345
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,679
All right.

1346
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:26,400
We're splitting it up.

1347
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,199
We're even.

1348
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:28,719
Okay.

1349
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,159
So now I think we head for the demon wilds, right?

1350
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,199
It's time.

1351
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm like really, really, really far.

1352
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:36,880
Yeah.

1353
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,639
Cause I'm noticing we have a countdown timer at the top until things get awful.

1354
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:41,280
Yeah.

1355
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,519
Yeah.

1356
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:48,130
So, you know, it's a long journey, but you know, worth it to save the world and such.

1357
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:49,650
Okay.

1358
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,210
Yeah, I guess.

1359
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:51,329
Oh no.

1360
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:52,530
So the calamity has grown.

1361
00:59:53,090 --> 01:00:00,449
We now get Gorgons, Watchmen, Bogmores and Draven get extra help.

1362
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:00,769
Okay.

1363
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:02,690
So what do we have?

1364
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,730
So these are our legacy points.

1365
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:03,809
Yeah.

1366
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,530
I think it's like, I think it's like some kind of abrasion on the camera.

1367
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,730
Stop some of the things like, like, I don't want to read Gorgon.

1368
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,849
Whatever it is like, like a glare on the lens.

1369
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:14,289
Maybe calamity and spend one.

1370
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:14,849
I'll get it figured out.

1371
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,010
Or we can just let them all through and see what happens.

1372
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:21,420
I don't, I don't want bow guys to be healthy guys.

1373
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:23,739
Yeah, I like that.

1374
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:24,780
I think we can handle the rest.

1375
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:28,300
Although I did get blinded by a deer and I've never been the same.

1376
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,489
I can't believe you lost an eye.

1377
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,090
I know.

1378
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,889
Well, I think I'd rather lose an eye than just have a wolf head.

1379
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,250
That's all I wanted.

1380
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:43,360
Okay.

1381
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:49,280
The demon walls have been revealed and we have, we have an assault on Swine Side Copes.

1382
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:51,170
Okay.

1383
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:52,780
Okay.

1384
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,389
We're attacking.

1385
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,090
All right.

1386
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,289
Would you like to be narrated now?

1387
01:00:59,090 --> 01:00:59,409
Yeah, sure.

1388
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,130
I'll narrate a little bit.

1389
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,409
The sun's fallen and the silver fog floats from the trees where shadows pool.

1390
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,300
You can see it.

1391
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,500
Wait, go back.

1392
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,460
I didn't even notice it at first.

1393
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,420
What happened?

1394
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,380
My little dog is on the left.

1395
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,820
Oh, you're just sitting there.

1396
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,630
Along us.

1397
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,590
Can you slow down?

1398
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,590
And I won't want to lose you.

1399
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:29,539
You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.

1400
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:31,489
I thought that's what it actually said.

1401
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,659
Said Mr. Nixon.

1402
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:36,699
You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.

1403
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:39,940
The quiet forms of fence around them.

1404
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,460
Impenetrable.

1405
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,579
The whirling air almost utterly opaque.

1406
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,179
Inan!

1407
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,800
You trust me, don't you?

1408
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,079
Let's get to the trees.

1409
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,300
At least those are solid.

1410
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,780
They halt just inside the shelter of the pines.

1411
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:01,260
Dark air clinging wet.

1412
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:08,139
The trunks they press to dampen their palms.

1413
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:09,579
Being lost with you isn't so bad.

1414
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,110
I'm the one who's lost.

1415
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:14,909
You guys are together.

1416
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:19,150
And then suddenly, and then something vast moves beside them.

1417
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:25,469
Slow, achingly slow.

1418
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:27,630
It passes too enormous to be seen.

1419
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:33,340
Impossibly silent.

1420
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:33,840
What?

1421
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,480
It's a tree.

1422
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,760
It's just a regular tree.

1423
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,199
Some kind of beast.

1424
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,389
What's that Pokemon?

1425
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,239
Why are we?

1426
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,639
Who took this other picture?

1427
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,840
Tradaru.

1428
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,440
It's all AI generated.

1429
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,400
That's the crazy thing.

1430
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,119
Wait, so hold on.

1431
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah, it's like, oh, look at this.

1432
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,920
But look at this too.

1433
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,119
This is a different, like, this is.

1434
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,239
They're trying to like really emphasize this really weird silhouette.

1435
01:02:59,869 --> 01:03:01,230
Night's fallen.

1436
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,909
The fog wanders away.

1437
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:09,409
Clinging to the felty outline of that gargantuan shadow.

1438
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:13,900
Oh, let's find Inan.

1439
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,099
Maybe he saw it too.

1440
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:15,980
Maybe he saw it better.

1441
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,139
So, as long as it's choice will probably put you guys in a two-man combat.

1442
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:25,900
Thomas's choice will find me first.

1443
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:30,559
Okay.

1444
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,519
I know you're beyond intrigued, but let's find Inan first.

1445
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,079
Bad night to be chasing moon beams.

1446
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:44,610
Oh, I'm the theater kid.

1447
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,489
I'm the theater kid.

1448
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:49,730
You are howling every chance you're grunting and growling.

1449
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,289
I have told you this before.

1450
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:53,489
The more I do this.

1451
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:54,929
There's another word for that, Jeremy.

1452
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:56,210
It's not theater kid.

1453
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:02,369
During the audition at the school play, you went down on all fours.

1454
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:05,409
And we're running around on the stage for the wolf character.

1455
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,289
And nobody else did that.

1456
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:08,130
Honestly, you want to know it's really cringe?

1457
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,409
Not giving it your all.

1458
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,019
That's true.

1459
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:11,980
They meet in the open.

1460
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,340
Crickets crackle again.

1461
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,539
Finding the rhythm.

1462
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,489
Somewhere, an owl pipes his blue notes.

1463
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:25,889
We're here.

1464
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:31,659
Apparently, Inan was also able to glimpse the shadowy giant as it passed.

1465
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,940
Didn't see more than a black suggestion of its form.

1466
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:39,019
I don't see a lot these days.

1467
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:44,929
Then, as they're about to decide whether to set up camp or search for huge tracks by starlight,

1468
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:47,170
the disturbance shakes the tree line.

1469
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:56,860
Okay, we all get plus one temporary hit points.

1470
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,980
You'll need it.

1471
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,340
We're probably going to need it.

1472
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:05,599
Okay, we have bogmores, rages, raccoons, and rose.

1473
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,119
Heaving its overgrown body in mucusy plops, its grasping mouth drips and stinks.

1474
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,539
And that fire spirit, we got to catch it.

1475
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:17,739
It says it won't be here for long.

1476
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:24,219
If we catch the fire spirit, it will actually give us like a legendary item.

1477
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:25,579
Oh, I'm up.

1478
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:26,059
I'm up here.

1479
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:38,300
I'm going to send them just in case something comes, but we definitely Thomas is still using

1480
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,260
a wooden spoon, even though we're in the second year of our journey.

1481
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,260
So we probably need to get him something.

1482
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,699
Why wouldn't I have just picked up a rock?

1483
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:45,420
It would have been better.

1484
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,130
Oh, okay.

1485
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,170
Go for it, Thomas.

1486
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:51,409
All right.

1487
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:54,610
How do I think I don't know if we have to kill it.

1488
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,010
There you go.

1489
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,210
Caught you.

1490
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,050
Do I get to make a wish now?

1491
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,650
Okay.

1492
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:06,849
So you can get a tier one fire wand or a legacy point.

1493
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:09,329
I mean, the wand is definitely got to be it.

1494
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:10,050
Yeah, for sure.

1495
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,380
Fire damage definitely replaced the spoon.

1496
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:19,420
Yeah.

1497
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,139
Replace the soup spoon that you've been carrying.

1498
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:22,380
Nice.

1499
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:24,050
Cool.

1500
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:28,050
And fire now has a stunt effect of damaging up to three nearby enemies.

1501
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,050
Replacing gear is permanent.

1502
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:31,730
That's the stunt effect.

1503
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:34,530
Nice.

1504
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:34,849
All right.

1505
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:35,090
Cool.

1506
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:39,219
So now I'm kind of out of the combat zone, though.

1507
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:40,099
So it's okay.

1508
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:40,900
I'm not going to push.

1509
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,860
We're just going to let them come to us.

1510
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,539
Good shot.

1511
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:54,099
Oh, shit.

1512
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,059
That's big.

1513
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:55,619
Whatever that is.

1514
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,849
Oh, not again.

1515
01:06:58,849 --> 01:06:59,329
Oh, no.

1516
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:04,610
Is this on like masochist difficulty?

1517
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,489
I'm going to see if I can blow the tree up.

1518
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,340
Is it going to hurt you?

1519
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:14,159
I don't think so.

1520
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:15,199
I don't think you can friendly fire.

1521
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,360
See if I can pop both these.

1522
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,699
I actually can hurt you.

1523
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,860
Can I hit them both from here?

1524
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,820
There we go.

1525
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,449
They blocked it.

1526
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:29,250
I'm dead.

1527
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:29,750
No.

1528
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,550
I'll save you.

1529
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:37,170
Oh, no, you're good.

1530
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:38,929
We lived.

1531
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:41,429
No.

1532
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:42,449
Oh, gosh.

1533
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:47,179
That thing is huge.

1534
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,219
This thing is terrifying.

1535
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:49,739
I think we're all dead, by the way.

1536
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,070
We need your magic, Stamble, than ever.

1537
01:07:55,789 --> 01:07:57,389
I can try and finish off this guy.

1538
01:07:57,389 --> 01:07:57,869
I think I can.

1539
01:07:58,429 --> 01:08:00,349
I can pin this person here, I think.

1540
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,789
If I do this.

1541
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:03,980
Oh, the Bogmaw?

1542
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,420
I can try it.

1543
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,619
Wait, am I moving him?

1544
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:08,219
If you pin him, he loses his movement next turn.

1545
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:08,719
That's good.

1546
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,619
This plant sends out tendrils that grab and draw in an enemy,

1547
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:14,139
dealing damage and pinning them.

1548
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:14,780
I'm going to try it.

1549
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,380
I could run away after the fact.

1550
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:16,699
Yeah.

1551
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:17,260
See if it works.

1552
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:19,939
Oh, you hit him.

1553
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:21,539
And you killed them.

1554
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:22,039
Whoa.

1555
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,890
All in a day's work, is what I'm saying.

1556
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:29,420
I get a swift action free wolf bite,

1557
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,819
but I think I can't use it because I'm holding a bow.

1558
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:35,659
I think you can't use it because you're not in melee range.

1559
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,779
No, I was trying to do it to the deer when it was next to me.

1560
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:40,420
Okay.

1561
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:42,159
Oh, oh, it's okay.

1562
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:42,880
It's only cardinal.

1563
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,600
This raccoon is just going to keep shooting.

1564
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,359
Maybe I run off to him.

1565
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,819
I feel like that's probably less dangerous.

1566
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,300
You ran off to it.

1567
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,189
You want to try and finish it?

1568
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,560
Then I start a blast.

1569
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,449
Oh, that's actually helpful.

1570
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:04,949
Nice.

1571
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:11,739
All right, we're okay.

1572
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:12,699
This is corruption.

1573
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:14,399
I wonder if I can reach from here.

1574
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,239
Wait, that took two actions.

1575
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:25,439
I was going to go nuts.

1576
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,960
Yeah, you moved really far.

1577
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,199
Okay.

1578
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,079
Well, I wanted to eat it.

1579
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,880
All right.

1580
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,680
What if I do this?

1581
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,720
Hopefully this doesn't hurt you guys.

1582
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:37,710
What?

1583
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,069
Oh, no, he dodged.

1584
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:42,770
There we go.

1585
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:46,239
All right.

1586
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,699
That was that was big.

1587
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:49,199
That worked.

1588
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:53,010
I did not think we were going to make it out of that.

1589
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:53,569
That was good.

1590
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:53,810
All right.

1591
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:57,250
We got a talisman of power ancient charm to hang around your waist.

1592
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:01,460
I think you should take this because you're going to be always up in front

1593
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,699
and you're going to always take hits.

1594
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,619
So you should be dealing damage at the front.

1595
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,140
Maybe we should save something.

1596
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,380
Like I should wear like more tanky stuff.

1597
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,579
We should give you guys the damage.

1598
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:11,060
Give it to me.

1599
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:11,859
Give it to me.

1600
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:12,500
Give it to me.

1601
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,819
That puts a long us up to one bonus damage.

1602
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:16,500
So he would do one extra damage.

1603
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,300
I need one second.

1604
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,340
Can you guys hear me?

1605
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:18,579
Yeah.

1606
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:19,220
Yeah, we can hear you.

1607
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:20,260
Okay.

1608
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,699
Oh, I think I like kicked my Wi-Fi or my router out.

1609
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,420
You're you're like breaking up a little bit.

1610
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,500
Wait, do you actually physically kicked it with your feet?

1611
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:32,189
Okay, let's just freeze it.

1612
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:34,590
You want to take like a should we take like a two minute break or something like him?

1613
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:37,069
Yeah, we take a two second break.

1614
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,350
Yeah, maybe like two minutes.

1615
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:40,750
Yeah, I'll make some coffee.

1616
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,250
Cool.

1617
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:47,600
I want to take a little break whilst the sorts of stuff now.

1618
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,560
You enjoying it?

1619
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,439
No, this is great.

1620
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,439
This is I so for people that have no idea what's going on.

1621
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:56,560
You can grab your coffee because I want to explain a little more detail.

1622
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,439
Go for it.

1623
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:58,699
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1624
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:01,739
Yeah, I think I kicked like the power cable halfway out.

1625
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:02,140
Really?

1626
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:02,699
Modem.

1627
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,619
So my internet was like half out.

1628
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:05,819
It was weird.

1629
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,720
But yeah, we'll be back in two minutes.

1630
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,140
Cool.

1631
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,029
So just before I go BRB, we're just going to take a quick two minute break.

1632
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:15,630
But for those of you that don't know what's going on,

1633
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,310
if you were like what the hell is going on,

1634
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,149
we kind of jumped right into it because I was a little late.

1635
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,579
This is all AI generated.

1636
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:29,140
So this whole game is a procedurally generated RPG AI D&D like.

1637
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,260
Not everything is AI and procedure generated.

1638
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:35,500
I know.

1639
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,020
Yeah, but a lot of stuff is.

1640
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:40,689
It's sort of just like a procedurally generated RPG.

1641
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,869
Not everything.

1642
01:11:43,869 --> 01:11:44,750
It's not AI.

1643
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,350
Well, I keep saying that it's stupid.

1644
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:47,789
That's the wrong thing.

1645
01:11:47,789 --> 01:11:48,350
But you know what I mean?

1646
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:52,850
It's just like random stuff that they plug in.

1647
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:56,050
RPG D&D or ADHD.

1648
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:01,649
But yeah, if you're curious as to like why is all this stuff so weird,

1649
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:07,039
it's because it's just generating it.

1650
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:12,000
And my camera, I have no idea why that was happening.

1651
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,920
I think it honestly was because the way the light was bouncing off the wall.

1652
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,159
I don't know.

1653
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:18,960
I'll have to figure that out.

1654
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:20,319
It seems to be gone now.

1655
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:22,500
But this is really fun.

1656
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,430
This is funny.

1657
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:26,350
I'm going to take two quick seconds.

1658
01:12:26,350 --> 01:16:12,109
I'll be right back.

1659
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:12,350
Yeah.

1660
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:12,989
Hello.

1661
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:14,050
I'm back.

1662
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,010
Hey, welcome back.

1663
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:15,729
I'm ready.

1664
01:16:15,729 --> 01:16:16,289
We're all ready.

1665
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:17,250
I think we're good to go.

1666
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:18,850
Yeah, we're good to go.

1667
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,210
I was thinking this game is so good if you like want to try D&D,

1668
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,850
but you don't have a friend who's a DM because the game is the DM.

1669
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,050
Yeah.

1670
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:29,090
So can you correct me when we were on break?

1671
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:29,810
I was talking about it.

1672
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,810
Is there is it AI?

1673
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:33,949
Yeah.

1674
01:16:33,949 --> 01:16:37,149
Yeah, it's all like every no adventure will be the same.

1675
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:38,350
It's like procedurally generated.

1676
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,670
There's like certain campaigns, but they have like not every campaign

1677
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,510
is going to have a wolf head and I'm not going to lose an eye.

1678
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:45,069
Right.

1679
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:45,710
It's all AI.

1680
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:52,989
I believe like to an extent that there are like events that happen,

1681
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:57,329
like the wolf head, but it is still like phrased differently, I assume.

1682
01:16:57,329 --> 01:17:01,010
The scenarios are written, but like what happens is kind of like

1683
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:03,489
all thrown into an AI and then like thrown at you.

1684
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:05,810
So it's just like a like a jumbler essentially.

1685
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:06,289
That's interesting.

1686
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:06,689
That's cool.

1687
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:07,600
Yeah.

1688
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,640
So like certain stories, so you can see at the top this this particular

1689
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,359
like encounter we found ourselves in is called silver and shadows

1690
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:14,640
and it tells you who the writer is.

1691
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,920
So someone wrote this story.

1692
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,119
Oh, oh, all right.

1693
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,420
But the AI kind of like puts everything in a timeline

1694
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,220
and then like, you know, throws the events at us and that kind of stuff.

1695
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,020
That's cool.

1696
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,579
All right.

1697
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:28,529
I'm you guys ready to go?

1698
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:29,729
Yes, let's do it.

1699
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:35,970
The fight has brought them back under the bows of the wood.

1700
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,829
I think it's quiet.

1701
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,270
I hate a night battle.

1702
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:42,909
Keep knocking into pronounced bows.

1703
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:46,899
Can you stop, please?

1704
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:48,260
Keep knocking into trees.

1705
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:52,020
It's too late.

1706
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:55,380
They make a broad search for sign of the giant's passing,

1707
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,619
but are forced to camp precious hours from sunrise having found nothing.

1708
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:05,739
Still, the story does quite well in taverns.

1709
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:09,020
And those who saw it dream of a colossal being,

1710
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:13,279
all shadowy gray, silver, fog, and overwhelming giant.

1711
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:16,510
They dream of seeing it again one day.

1712
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:20,180
They dream for years and years.

1713
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,939
I'm in the corner like, yeah, I'm above all this human stuff now.

1714
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:26,750
All right, three legacy points.

1715
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,470
Is this implying that we spent years just hanging out?

1716
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:29,949
Yes.

1717
01:18:29,949 --> 01:18:30,989
This might be a time skip.

1718
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:33,840
We just got a three year time skip?

1719
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,750
We needed a break.

1720
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,069
Hold on.

1721
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:43,390
Did we just spend three years telling everybody how cool we are for fighting in the woods?

1722
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:49,060
I think it's more like it's telling us it's the narrator saying

1723
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,979
that this will happen for years to come.

1724
01:18:50,979 --> 01:18:52,979
Like people will tell the stories for years to come.

1725
01:18:53,539 --> 01:18:55,220
We're still in our second year of our adventure,

1726
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,659
but he's kind of like saying people will talk about their deeds for years to come.

1727
01:18:58,659 --> 01:18:59,060
Yeah.

1728
01:18:59,060 --> 01:18:59,300
Okay.

1729
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,020
Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

1730
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:04,819
Okay. So we can go to the Hallenwilds or the night top.

1731
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:06,100
You know, this is year two.

1732
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,460
So it was a time skip.

1733
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:12,100
Yeah. So we can, if you mouse over the Hallenwild seems to be infested with Gorgons.

1734
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,460
They may ambush our group.

1735
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,739
And the other one is Draven, which may ambush our group.

1736
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,460
If we check our card deck again, our calamities by pressing B

1737
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:26,819
or clicking the one in the top right, we can see that the Gorgons are kind of stacked.

1738
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:27,939
They are.

1739
01:19:27,939 --> 01:19:31,140
And the Draven look kind of weak by comparison.

1740
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:33,220
So it might be worth...

1741
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:37,140
Oh yeah. And we avoided the one Draven once.

1742
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,699
Let's Draven.

1743
01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:39,539
Yeah. So let's go Draven.

1744
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:41,220
Cause I think that's like the safer bet.

1745
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:41,699
Good idea.

1746
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,899
Cause we are very injured right now, actually.

1747
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:45,140
What?

1748
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,220
And you'll see that we're healing over time as we travel.

1749
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,579
Wait, wait, two years passed and we're hurt?

1750
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,020
No, it was the narrator.

1751
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,859
It was confusing, but it was the narrator saying that

1752
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,899
people would be talking about our stories for years to come.

1753
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:00,899
But the top says year two, day 20.

1754
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:04,100
That's yeah, that's our entire journey so far has been two years.

1755
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:07,489
Randomly generated.

1756
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:09,899
Yeah. It's, you know, I'm angrily traveling.

1757
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:13,340
Okay. Well, Assault Viv Mia shop is our thing.

1758
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,380
I'm low health, but I think we can do it.

1759
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,909
We can also choose if you see at the bottom right,

1760
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:23,069
you can see that we don't just have an assault choice.

1761
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:25,710
We have a patrol choice, which will send our party to clear

1762
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,909
the infestation on the tile and reduce the strength of the enemy.

1763
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:31,630
So we can spend some time just like kind of scouting.

1764
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,180
How, how certain are we going to lose this?

1765
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:39,069
It's, it, it's strength four.

1766
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,789
If we clear it, it'll become a strength three.

1767
01:20:41,789 --> 01:20:42,109
Okay.

1768
01:20:42,109 --> 01:20:43,149
We like patrol.

1769
01:20:43,149 --> 01:20:43,789
See if we can do it.

1770
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:46,029
Yeah, there we go.

1771
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:49,310
Okay. So now it's a strength three, which is more doable and I healed up.

1772
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,109
Perfect.

1773
01:20:50,109 --> 01:20:51,069
So this is perfect.

1774
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:13,739
Oh, a little nervous.

1775
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:17,680
Telling myself it's all birds and mice out there.

1776
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,649
You click.

1777
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:24,819
Of course I'm tense.

1778
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:28,060
Moments before a battle, I get all squeezed up inside.

1779
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:28,859
I'm good.

1780
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:32,289
That's it.

1781
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:39,260
Yeah. What?

1782
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,819
We gained temporary damage of potency because you, you, uh, yeah.

1783
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:46,779
Apparently my incredible simple overconfidence.

1784
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,819
Yeah. Through the power of like toxic masculinity,

1785
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:53,020
you put up a front that you had to deal with this.

1786
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,140
Hey, I appreciate that.

1787
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,739
Yep. I'm good.

1788
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:56,939
Yup. I'm good.

1789
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:57,340
Me too.

1790
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:58,539
Yep. Same.

1791
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:06,659
Okay. So this is a small area and dots.

1792
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,100
Okay.

1793
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,430
I think I'm, I'm, I'm kind of scared.

1794
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,229
I'm going to stay back.

1795
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:20,670
That scarecrow is blocking the path.

1796
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,270
Open fire.

1797
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:25,250
Oh, oh my God.

1798
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:26,720
Nice.

1799
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,119
Strong.

1800
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:33,659
Okay. I'm going to, yeah, I'll jump here and then I'm going to sentinel.

1801
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:34,859
If they get too close.

1802
01:22:34,859 --> 01:22:36,300
I'm going to infuse the wagon.

1803
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,500
If they walk near the way.

1804
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,180
Actually, let me see if I can do it now.

1805
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:39,579
I can.

1806
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,479
All right. I'm going to do a, I'm going to do a blast.

1807
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:42,880
That's huge.

1808
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:50,260
Oh, let me do this again.

1809
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,420
Um, actually I was going to move.

1810
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,100
I'm going to get a better spot.

1811
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:04,750
I have never heard of a player like being a werewolf and using a bow.

1812
01:23:07,229 --> 01:23:08,670
Who has that like fantasy?

1813
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,229
I mean, into a wolf and just pick up a bow.

1814
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:16,189
Imagine a situation where you can identify an enemy location via your sense of smell.

1815
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:20,109
So even in like pitch darkness, you're an excellent ranger.

1816
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:23,229
Yeah. I don't believe all the dogs are good at smelling stuff.

1817
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:24,350
My dog is an idiot.

1818
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:26,590
Like there's no way it's smelling stuff that I can't smell.

1819
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,470
Okay. But you're not a dog.

1820
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,670
You're a wolf, man.

1821
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,989
Yeah. You're a, you're a, well, you're a wolf.

1822
01:23:30,989 --> 01:23:32,029
Um, wolf head.

1823
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:32,829
I'm not buying it.

1824
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,750
I'm not buying it.

1825
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,470
Okay.

1826
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,430
It's propaganda.

1827
01:23:36,989 --> 01:23:38,430
Gemma, how are you liking the wizard?

1828
01:23:39,069 --> 01:23:40,029
It's fun.

1829
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:43,390
I like the, you kind of have to tap into scenery and then blow up scenery.

1830
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,550
I don't know if I'm, I don't think I have like a regular attack.

1831
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,510
Maybe I'm not close enough.

1832
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,510
No, I think this is it.

1833
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:48,829
Yeah.

1834
01:23:48,829 --> 01:23:50,029
Yeah. I have a strike.

1835
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:58,859
Yeah. I forgot that you do like insane fire damage because you're warm.

1836
01:23:58,859 --> 01:23:59,819
Yeah. I think it's crazy.

1837
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:01,659
I need to start doing that more often instead of blow up.

1838
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:09,939
Oh, I leveled in and dogwood is now a blood horn warrior.

1839
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:10,659
Ooh.

1840
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:11,460
I can interrupt.

1841
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,819
I can upgrade my central move.

1842
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:13,859
I can go untouchable.

1843
01:24:14,579 --> 01:24:18,340
When Inon gets a kill, the next attack against him within one turn will miss.

1844
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,460
That seems really good.

1845
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,899
That does seem great.

1846
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:23,869
Um, yeah, I really like that.

1847
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:25,949
I, because I keep getting my ass beat.

1848
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:26,350
Ooh.

1849
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:31,939
A fang axe, tier one axe plus one damage to drawmen.

1850
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:36,420
It does bonus damage to drawmen forged by long dead roamers of the wild lands.

1851
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:42,579
So we can either give this to one of you guys just so you have like an alternative weapon

1852
01:24:42,659 --> 01:24:45,140
or I can just take it for when we fight drawmen.

1853
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:46,979
Is this better than what you have?

1854
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,420
Uh, it's, I think it's about this.

1855
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,939
It's the same as what I have, but it has more shred and stunt damage,

1856
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:57,539
but I also have an empty weapon slot so I can like carry both.

1857
01:24:59,340 --> 01:24:59,659
Hmm.

1858
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:03,600
Um, but you don't have like a melee weapon per se.

1859
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,359
So if you want like something, just in case something's in your face or you don't have any,

1860
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:11,279
uh, scenery to play, to pull from, we can do that too.

1861
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:16,829
Um, I, I think it's just go to, uh, can I, do I do very much melee damage?

1862
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:21,260
Um, I think the damage is dependent on the weapon itself.

1863
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:26,779
So it says five damage on the weapon and I think like damage is just like,

1864
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:29,100
if you get plus damage gear, it would apply to everything you do.

1865
01:25:29,979 --> 01:25:32,800
I mean, if I'll take it and put it in my other slot.

1866
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:33,840
Yeah.

1867
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,279
If, uh, if it's not better than what you have.

1868
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,840
No, it's, it's the same as what I have.

1869
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,399
All right.

1870
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:38,960
Yeah, that's good.

1871
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:40,720
Yeah, cool.

1872
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,600
Cool.

1873
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,279
And then we get the phone shadow pauldrons, which gives five dodge.

1874
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:47,630
You should dodge.

1875
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,250
Let's see.

1876
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,270
I do not want to see another eye come out.

1877
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,630
Uh, everyone's saying Austin.

1878
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:53,869
Yep.

1879
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:56,140
It didn't.

1880
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:56,939
Austin, did you announce it?

1881
01:25:56,939 --> 01:25:58,300
Are these tanky though?

1882
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,960
I feel like they might be a ranger thing.

1883
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,699
Just take them.

1884
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,699
And then if you get a tanky thing, just we can trade it later, right?

1885
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:11,140
Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be flying in a, uh, in a plane simulation with Austin

1886
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:11,859
in a couple of days.

1887
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,680
It's gonna be wild.

1888
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,960
Go check the Twitter.

1889
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,760
I'll retweet that too.

1890
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,720
What a minute.

1891
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,840
If only he dodged.

1892
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,550
We came out losing very little.

1893
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:26,750
Some ripped scuffs and notches, but mostly clean.

1894
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,949
That's a worthy day's work.

1895
01:26:28,989 --> 01:26:30,270
I don't know how I get.

1896
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:33,310
I don't trust simple success as irrational as them.

1897
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,399
Jesus Christ.

1898
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:41,890
You think of all the stuff that's out there.

1899
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:43,010
Evil.

1900
01:26:43,649 --> 01:26:44,449
Yeah.

1901
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,810
Or just hungry.

1902
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:50,909
Could come rampaging into our midst and take one of us away.

1903
01:26:50,909 --> 01:26:52,750
Makes me frustrated.

1904
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,470
How fragile we all still are.

1905
01:26:56,189 --> 01:26:57,869
Someone asked if he was Scooby-Doo.

1906
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:05,949
Yeah, I was gonna say you're getting into like, like, like, no, like ape territory.

1907
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:09,949
Like, I think he's just, just general beast.

1908
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:10,350
Yeah.

1909
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:10,989
General beast.

1910
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:11,229
Okay.

1911
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:13,229
I was like, I was a person before.

1912
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:14,590
I don't know what it is to be a wolf.

1913
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,909
You are quite close to just, yeah.

1914
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:18,909
I'm more a man than I am wolf.

1915
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:20,029
Okay.

1916
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:22,189
So the Draven got stronger.

1917
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:24,189
They learned from their defeat.

1918
01:27:24,189 --> 01:27:26,140
Oh, but that's okay.

1919
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,260
That's their first card.

1920
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,449
So it's not a big deal.

1921
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:35,489
Do we want to secure the, the, the shop or do we want to press on?

1922
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:37,680
Does that mean we can buy stuff?

1923
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,180
It means we can get an item like we got last time.

1924
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,220
Ooh, secure.

1925
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:44,500
We're greedy.

1926
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,420
Yeah, I say secure.

1927
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,619
Let's find an item then.

1928
01:27:47,619 --> 01:27:49,380
I'm in the mood for some scaring and discovering.

1929
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,220
We can set this place right as we go, can't we?

1930
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,699
Investigate thoroughly.

1931
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:53,939
Okay.

1932
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:03,619
Nice job.

1933
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:04,899
All right.

1934
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:05,779
Secure complete.

1935
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:07,539
You look so happy.

1936
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:12,979
Study the world and you'll never finish discovering wonders.

1937
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:15,060
Looks like you guys are playing fetch.

1938
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:16,670
Yeah, it does.

1939
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:20,340
Somebody want to take a narrator?

1940
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:23,199
So we've unlocked.

1941
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,640
No, I think you're doing a great job.

1942
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,279
Okay.

1943
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:32,000
So a thorough delving through the mysteries of Viv Mia shop has proven rewarding.

1944
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,979
Viv Mia shop will return to the hands of the common folk.

1945
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:40,180
While they tend to the site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.

1946
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:45,460
You've got two leaves and one of those.

1947
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:52,210
Click done and we should get a weapon.

1948
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:52,689
There we go.

1949
01:28:52,689 --> 01:29:00,399
Warding is star slate necklace and warding is absorbing magic damage.

1950
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,699
Somebody rather you for being up front, right?

1951
01:29:03,699 --> 01:29:04,180
Yeah.

1952
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,140
Yeah, I'd go for it.

1953
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:07,420
Okay.

1954
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,060
So if you guys look in the top left of the screen,

1955
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,020
you'll see that along us is currently glowing and he has an icon.

1956
01:29:13,899 --> 01:29:16,460
So that means that he has a side quest that we can pursue.

1957
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:18,579
I mean, let's do it.

1958
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:20,180
If we click that side quest.

1959
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,100
How long has it been?

1960
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:29,710
Haven't I wait.

1961
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:32,029
I forgot how you like change the reader.

1962
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:33,470
Oh, yeah.

1963
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,109
Just is it just when I press next, I like took it.

1964
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:36,270
Yeah.

1965
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,789
So we had to check the box.

1966
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,229
We're just reading along with you now.

1967
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:42,109
Haven't cracked a book in ages.

1968
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:46,270
How long since I've felt inspired?

1969
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:47,550
See a more man.

1970
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:52,930
Well, you're turning into like Arthur Morgan.

1971
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:56,399
I've been through a lot along us.

1972
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:57,199
Why you vote here?

1973
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:04,029
You won't suppose to find my note until tomorrow.

1974
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:05,279
Here.

1975
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:09,520
I thought I was being nice, letting you rest.

1976
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,079
Yeah.

1977
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:11,359
No, you are.

1978
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,279
I just wanted some time.

1979
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,579
I don't know what it is really.

1980
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:29,090
Mind if I keep you company?

1981
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,420
I'm sure you can come.

1982
01:30:34,539 --> 01:30:34,859
Okay.

1983
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:36,539
Just let me get my travel things.

1984
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:41,460
You have any idea where we're off to?

1985
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,020
I don't know.

1986
01:30:42,819 --> 01:30:44,100
Where are we going?

1987
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:49,140
I left you a note and I didn't really think beyond that.

1988
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,310
We have options.

1989
01:30:52,109 --> 01:30:54,189
I need to spark my mind somehow.

1990
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:55,789
I need to become inspired.

1991
01:30:57,489 --> 01:31:04,430
And that case isn't the bar a good place to start.

1992
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,750
No, it's beyond the horizon.

1993
01:31:07,149 --> 01:31:07,470
Face.

1994
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:08,590
He gives it number two.

1995
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:09,069
Like, what?

1996
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:09,949
I didn't think of that.

1997
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:12,449
What are you doing?

1998
01:31:12,449 --> 01:31:13,329
I chose the bar.

1999
01:31:13,329 --> 01:31:14,689
I didn't think of that.

2000
01:31:14,689 --> 01:31:16,460
That was clever.

2001
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:16,619
Yeah.

2002
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:20,300
I love how your side quest is let's go get a drink for like a half hour.

2003
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,039
I've just been running around in the woods.

2004
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:25,680
I can click it again.

2005
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,460
It's the same.

2006
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,920
Did we just complete it?

2007
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,479
Okay.

2008
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,220
I think you didn't.

2009
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:33,539
I think.

2010
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:34,659
Oh, I think you have to.

2011
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:35,949
You got to select one.

2012
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:36,189
Yeah.

2013
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:36,989
I did select.

2014
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:42,079
I think the selecting that one is making it because I'm choosing number two.

2015
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,880
Maybe the bar is like it's just ending your adventure.

2016
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,960
It's suspending the side quest because it's like you're not actually leaving on a journey.

2017
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,159
You're just going to the bar.

2018
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,140
Oh, let's choose.

2019
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,380
Yeah.

2020
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:53,579
Okay.

2021
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:59,020
I guess somehow throughout this, I was just third wheeling behind you guys carrying like

2022
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,300
the wagon or something.

2023
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,260
That's so funny.

2024
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,479
I'm here.

2025
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:04,739
I know we're big time.

2026
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:05,060
Wow.

2027
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,020
Look at this journey.

2028
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:08,180
Oh, my God.

2029
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,939
We're going so far.

2030
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:12,340
We're going back to the altar where I transformed.

2031
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:15,840
This is like a seven month journey.

2032
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,079
Yeah.

2033
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,760
You guys are my best friends.

2034
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,479
Oh, no.

2035
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:20,479
Things got really bad in our absence as well.

2036
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,329
We have so many points.

2037
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,609
Let's just like just.

2038
01:32:24,609 --> 01:32:25,810
I think I want to can't.

2039
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:25,970
Yeah.

2040
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:27,010
You want to just cancel a little bit.

2041
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:29,789
We're not fighting anything.

2042
01:32:29,789 --> 01:32:30,829
Pass everything.

2043
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:31,390
Nothing happened.

2044
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,189
No clammies.

2045
01:32:32,189 --> 01:32:34,270
We're fine.

2046
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:37,699
Why are we going all the way over here?

2047
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:40,020
So what do you think of Brighton?

2048
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,630
You're blind.

2049
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,470
Is that what this place is called?

2050
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:52,539
They say the brave who come here shall learn themselves the deepest truth.

2051
01:32:52,539 --> 01:32:55,899
Well, one thing I've learned is to mistrust your vacation ideas.

2052
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:05,149
We traveled a year out here.

2053
01:33:05,149 --> 01:33:07,789
They didn't have the budget for me in this side story.

2054
01:33:07,789 --> 01:33:08,189
Yeah.

2055
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:09,550
How come you're not here?

2056
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,069
I'm just carrying the bags.

2057
01:33:11,869 --> 01:33:12,590
What are we doing?

2058
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,039
I'm trying to stay upbeat about this, but.

2059
01:33:20,979 --> 01:33:21,859
The day dies.

2060
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:22,899
Sun falls away.

2061
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,739
And in the night, they build a fire.

2062
01:33:24,739 --> 01:33:26,020
Why do we even?

2063
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:26,739
Why do we do this?

2064
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:28,800
Just keep going.

2065
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,920
There must be a reason.

2066
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,880
I don't know what I expected to find.

2067
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,279
I think I'm mostly looking for a feeling.

2068
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:43,500
Is that really something you can search for?

2069
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,819
Remember when we did this?

2070
01:33:45,819 --> 01:33:47,020
Everything was new.

2071
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:50,140
Each path we took and every labor we put ourselves to.

2072
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:52,159
I'm bored.

2073
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,699
You know, it's really boring walking for a year and.

2074
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:00,340
To find to build a fire in the woods.

2075
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,180
And not fighting anything, not doing any adventures.

2076
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:06,020
We just we just go like on a walk across the whole country.

2077
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,739
You know, what's even more boring than that is doing the same thing.

2078
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:10,500
But neither of you spoke to me for a year.

2079
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,710
I just yeah, we didn't even ask.

2080
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:15,710
You just came.

2081
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:20,930
Tell me of sorrow this rose that you kept.

2082
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:24,130
By the bed in which last your pole is about slapped.

2083
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,649
Why am I singing this?

2084
01:34:25,649 --> 01:34:26,529
That's a theater kid.

2085
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:30,939
That song.

2086
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,880
She woke full of laughter and brightly she gazed

2087
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,680
at the curve of her mouth and a kiss she appraised.

2088
01:34:44,659 --> 01:34:45,859
All right, I'm going to count you guys in.

2089
01:34:45,859 --> 01:34:48,899
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2090
01:34:48,899 --> 01:34:50,819
She sang over the hills.

2091
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,420
It instantly voice jammered me.

2092
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,539
Take your headphones out.

2093
01:34:57,539 --> 01:34:58,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2094
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:00,659
Sir, sir, take out your headphones.

2095
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:01,140
Okay.

2096
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,100
Ready?

2097
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,619
Three, two, one.

2098
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,100
She sang over the hills.

2099
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,779
Peaks are shy, but sure dawn.

2100
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:13,140
And sure as the sunrise I'll someday be gone.

2101
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,739
But recall me my love.

2102
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:17,539
And our joy may live on.

2103
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:23,779
And you do and you do and you do you.

2104
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:24,579
That's a howl at the end.

2105
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:25,380
There has to be a howl at the end.

2106
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:31,699
And then we fused as one.

2107
01:35:31,699 --> 01:35:38,369
The old love song is one he's sung a hundred times by a fire,

2108
01:35:38,369 --> 01:35:40,130
a hundred times with a friend.

2109
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:42,779
And still tonight it feels new.

2110
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:50,960
Strange song always broke my heart when we sing it together.

2111
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,380
Forming a deeper bond of love.

2112
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,899
I we might be.

2113
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:56,819
I suppose we each thought of each other

2114
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:00,109
and what it would be like to have to go on alone.

2115
01:36:00,109 --> 01:36:02,989
Is the relationship more akin to like a human and a pet dog?

2116
01:36:02,989 --> 01:36:03,630
Or is it like?

2117
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:04,750
I don't know.

2118
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:05,229
We'll find out.

2119
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,930
A noise rises in the darkness.

2120
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,369
Not an echo of them,

2121
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:13,170
but the resonant call of something else.

2122
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,899
Did our voices awake the neighbors?

2123
01:36:18,779 --> 01:36:22,460
Well, there's been some run ins out here.

2124
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,180
Stick by the fire.

2125
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,220
Maybe it's nothing.

2126
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,109
If we're being hunted,

2127
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:29,470
I say we turn the snares on our enemy.

2128
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:35,409
Okay. Well, so my choice here is to let you guys stay by the fire

2129
01:36:35,409 --> 01:36:37,170
with the guy with the fire wand.

2130
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:39,970
Ooh, that's a sure bet.

2131
01:36:40,609 --> 01:36:44,609
Or roll the dice on a Lugas hunting prey.

2132
01:36:44,609 --> 01:36:46,930
I'm going to stay by the fire for you guys.

2133
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:53,819
Oh, I want to sing and I want to kill and I want to fuck.

2134
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:56,859
They stand back to back at the rim of the fire light.

2135
01:36:56,859 --> 01:36:57,819
A foe emerges.

2136
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:01,390
Oh shit.

2137
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,909
These look scary.

2138
01:37:02,909 --> 01:37:03,789
Like, yeah.

2139
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,390
They're like necrobots.

2140
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:07,310
Yeah, they're like necrobots.

2141
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:09,229
So wait, you have you're here.

2142
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:13,100
So I think these side stories normally involve two characters,

2143
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,619
but the whole pie comes along.

2144
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:22,300
Oh, and early on he said he loved you.

2145
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,579
So you would have been like the guy.

2146
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:24,539
All right.

2147
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:25,340
I'm fusing this.

2148
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:26,619
Yeah, I don't know.

2149
01:37:26,619 --> 01:37:28,859
I think they're going to actually one over there.

2150
01:37:28,859 --> 01:37:30,220
I think they all gather over there.

2151
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:32,140
It is this one on each side.

2152
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:40,239
Okay, I'm going to I'm going to just pin this person over here

2153
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,500
so they don't move.

2154
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:46,289
You guys can deal with that.

2155
01:37:49,149 --> 01:37:50,420
Demolished.

2156
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:50,899
Good work.

2157
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,619
I'll get in front of you.

2158
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,720
I can just hurt it.

2159
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,069
Nice.

2160
01:37:59,069 --> 01:38:07,869
Somebody still have an action?

2161
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,470
Yeah, hold on.

2162
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:11,470
No, it won't let me.

2163
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:19,180
Let me see.

2164
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:21,260
I'm waiting for the walls of your room to fall down,

2165
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:26,380
revealing you're in front of a live studio audience.

2166
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,020
Nice work.

2167
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:29,409
Oh, my level.

2168
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:29,909
Yeah.

2169
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,109
Piercing shots.

2170
01:38:34,109 --> 01:38:35,789
My range attacks have to pierce.

2171
01:38:35,789 --> 01:38:37,779
Does that mean it goes through, buddies?

2172
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:39,979
Passive a bard.

2173
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:42,939
A lungus reduces the cost of recruit job.

2174
01:38:42,939 --> 01:38:44,939
We've never done that ever.

2175
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:45,819
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

2176
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:47,979
One speed.

2177
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:48,779
You can upgrade howl.

2178
01:38:49,579 --> 01:38:54,340
Howl.

2179
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:54,840
I'm a wolf.

2180
01:38:57,359 --> 01:38:58,319
Look at that.

2181
01:38:58,319 --> 01:38:59,199
Warrior's armor.

2182
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,590
Yeah, I'll link mail.

2183
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:06,829
That looks pretty sick.

2184
01:39:06,829 --> 01:39:08,109
It's not even my adventure.

2185
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,149
I'll take the loot.

2186
01:39:11,329 --> 01:39:13,859
To my eyes, it's all clear.

2187
01:39:13,859 --> 01:39:16,479
Same here, nothing moving.

2188
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:17,920
Well, that was sudden.

2189
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,699
Seems like we'll survive another night.

2190
01:39:27,699 --> 01:39:30,100
You know, I'm glad we came out.

2191
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:35,520
But let us be on the road at dawn.

2192
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,720
Yeah.

2193
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:42,289
When you sang and when I sang with you,

2194
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,260
I considered that word I tend to think of all the time.

2195
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,979
It's raising.

2196
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:50,939
It's like a well.

2197
01:39:53,149 --> 01:39:55,949
This well inside you will always fill and empty.

2198
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:56,510
It's fine.

2199
01:39:56,510 --> 01:40:03,069
But I want to live for the lasting things like love and old well-worn songs.

2200
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,989
In the morning, they will simply start home.

2201
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,630
So if we walk all the way back, I will lose it.

2202
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,310
Just for clarity's sake, we could have done this.

2203
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:18,420
Anywhere, like a year ago.

2204
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,220
We could have just walked in.

2205
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:23,789
Yeah, but along us convinced us to walk for a year to the birthplace.

2206
01:40:23,789 --> 01:40:27,550
Oh, he leveled up from doing his side quests.

2207
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:31,229
He's going to live 10 extra years and he now gets another move.

2208
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:32,989
I'm a blue-born hunter now.

2209
01:40:32,989 --> 01:40:36,000
I can throw a trap.

2210
01:40:38,189 --> 01:40:41,659
Every time I kill an enemy, I can enter the gray plane.

2211
01:40:41,659 --> 01:40:44,140
That's stealth.

2212
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,260
30 dodge.

2213
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,630
30 dodge sounds like a lot.

2214
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:50,939
It does.

2215
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:52,699
Yeah, and you already have the plus dodge stuff.

2216
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:54,699
Oh, and you can reroll these with lupi.

2217
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:55,739
Yeah.

2218
01:40:55,739 --> 01:40:58,369
I feel like I'm not supposed to waste that.

2219
01:40:58,369 --> 01:40:59,729
How much LP do we all have?

2220
01:40:59,729 --> 01:41:03,470
It says at the eight at the top, right?

2221
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:05,520
So we share this as a group.

2222
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:05,840
Yeah.

2223
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,319
Okay.

2224
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:11,939
Did anything reroll?

2225
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:14,659
It gave me the same dodge again.

2226
01:41:14,659 --> 01:41:15,380
Oh, okay.

2227
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:16,819
For a second, I thought nothing changed.

2228
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:17,939
And wind walk.

2229
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:23,100
Wind walk is like Misty Step.

2230
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,939
Like you'll be able to teleport somewhere, I think.

2231
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:28,159
Thornbanging.

2232
01:41:28,899 --> 01:41:29,399
Okay.

2233
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:31,970
Because that bite was doing a lot of damage.

2234
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:35,890
I think we can go to the Hallenwalds from here and just walk.

2235
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,409
It's only 20 days.

2236
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:39,329
Wait, weren't we at the Hallenwalds, though?

2237
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:42,699
No, this is fine.

2238
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:47,199
Okay.

2239
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:52,000
Wow, we really did lose six months and 33 days on that journey.

2240
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,159
I can't believe we walked from just here all the way to here.

2241
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,520
I would like to apologize.

2242
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,279
Or us to sing a song.

2243
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:04,659
Okay, Hallenwalds has been revealed.

2244
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:08,989
See, this is a big world.

2245
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:10,029
Wait.

2246
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,029
Okay, so we can't actually...

2247
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:13,229
This is the last place.

2248
01:42:13,229 --> 01:42:15,470
It says assault the Lithgram engine.

2249
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:17,310
We must achieve our other objectives first.

2250
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:19,710
So we must clear all the hostiles in the land.

2251
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:21,710
So we have to go to the other three places.

2252
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:24,939
Everywhere is in part...

2253
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:25,659
Oh, no.

2254
01:42:25,659 --> 01:42:29,180
Oh, the only place we haven't been is Humble Demon Beaches,

2255
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:29,979
which is all...

2256
01:42:29,979 --> 01:42:31,180
It's going to be a year.

2257
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,060
It's going to be so far.

2258
01:42:33,659 --> 01:42:39,789
Let's patrol this place and get rid of the thorns,

2259
01:42:39,789 --> 01:42:41,390
and then we will leave.

2260
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:43,789
Well, at least you leveled up a couple of times.

2261
01:42:43,789 --> 01:42:46,029
I tricked my party into taking me on a walk.

2262
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:47,359
Okay.

2263
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:48,560
A very long walk.

2264
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,079
How far is this trip?

2265
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:53,489
Okay, are we carving a pass all the way there?

2266
01:42:53,489 --> 01:42:56,050
It's a commitment, but I think it'll bring us goodwill.

2267
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:58,369
Goodwill can buy you a lot in times of need.

2268
01:42:58,369 --> 01:43:01,859
Okay, I guess let's get started

2269
01:43:01,859 --> 01:43:04,739
and try and carve our way to the place we haven't been.

2270
01:43:04,739 --> 01:43:05,539
Let's get started.

2271
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,819
Okay, 78 days it will take.

2272
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:10,020
Oh, my God.

2273
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,380
Oh, my goodness.

2274
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,579
We have to walk all the way.

2275
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:18,260
We lost nearly two years from your inspiration journey.

2276
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:18,899
I love this.

2277
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:21,939
We spent more time finding inspiration for you

2278
01:43:21,939 --> 01:43:23,460
than we have on the rest of our quest.

2279
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,500
Thank you.

2280
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:26,140
You're good friends.

2281
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,060
Oh, God.

2282
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,180
Oh, no.

2283
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,460
Okay, so this is our first incursion.

2284
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,779
So Gorgons and Greatnumber move to attack our lands.

2285
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:34,300
Your enemies will travel from tile to tile,

2286
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,060
attacking and destroying all the sites.

2287
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,420
And so they are repelled.

2288
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:38,779
Okay, so what's going to happen is

2289
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:41,420
you can see their progress here.

2290
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:42,859
They're going to come from that land

2291
01:43:42,859 --> 01:43:45,340
through Arnie Vigil and then Thunderost.

2292
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,979
So should we just set up shop in Arnie Village?

2293
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:51,100
Yeah, that's the best.

2294
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,180
Probably the best idea is to set up shop in Arnie

2295
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,779
and then intercept them.

2296
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:56,220
Or we can just keep building this bridge

2297
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:57,420
and then like follow them.

2298
01:43:58,899 --> 01:43:59,460
Wrap around.

2299
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:01,920
I'm down for whatever.

2300
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,840
Yeah, I think we can intercept them, right?

2301
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,180
That's probably safe.

2302
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:10,300
Yeah, that's secure.

2303
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,510
Okay, do you want to find an item while we're securing?

2304
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:16,430
I think we should work faster

2305
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,670
with the whole incursion situation.

2306
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,310
Yeah, okay.

2307
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,189
Okay, that's good.

2308
01:44:20,189 --> 01:44:25,359
Yeah, let's just take everyone off of this.

2309
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:26,689
Yeah.

2310
01:44:26,689 --> 01:44:27,890
And go.

2311
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:30,770
Yeah, because they might just be on their way over here now.

2312
01:44:31,329 --> 01:44:33,090
Yeah, see how it's filling up with...

2313
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,609
Okay, do we want to cancel all these?

2314
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:36,529
No, I think we can handle these.

2315
01:44:36,529 --> 01:44:37,779
I think we're all right.

2316
01:44:37,779 --> 01:44:40,210
We don't want to waste all of our points.

2317
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:41,329
Yeah, we're strong.

2318
01:44:41,329 --> 01:44:42,180
Oh, no.

2319
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:44,850
Whatever this is, what's this?

2320
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:45,329
Gorgons?

2321
01:44:45,329 --> 01:44:47,340
Gorgons is terrifying.

2322
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:47,819
Yeah.

2323
01:44:47,819 --> 01:44:48,779
Oh, my God.

2324
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:49,579
What counter is this?

2325
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:51,020
Oh, it's a raging Gorgon.

2326
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,380
Okay, okay.

2327
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:54,100
So we're dead.

2328
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:54,500
Everything's...

2329
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,460
No, everything's fine.

2330
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:55,939
We've got this.

2331
01:44:55,939 --> 01:44:57,300
We're going to crush this.

2332
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:01,180
We've been killing everything.

2333
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:05,260
Arnyvigil has been cleaned and put in good order,

2334
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,979
with time left for a few days of comfort.

2335
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:10,300
Arnyvigil will return to the hands of the common folk

2336
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,340
while they tend it.

2337
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:16,109
The site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.

2338
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:17,710
Tides, ingots, spell threads.

2339
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:18,109
Good.

2340
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:20,930
They were carved in the past.

2341
01:45:24,529 --> 01:45:24,930
I think it's...

2342
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:27,489
You know what I mean?

2343
01:45:27,569 --> 01:45:28,289
Yeah, I don't know how...

2344
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:34,909
Are we building a bridge so the enemy can use that bridge?

2345
01:45:34,909 --> 01:45:36,029
We're not doing that, are we?

2346
01:45:36,909 --> 01:45:37,710
Yeah, I think we are.

2347
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:40,590
Why are we helping them?

2348
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,069
It's fine.

2349
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,470
What else are we going to do, I guess?

2350
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:44,989
They can't get over here.

2351
01:45:44,989 --> 01:45:47,439
We're helping them get over here.

2352
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:48,079
Well, they're...

2353
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:48,800
Yeah, they're beasts.

2354
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,600
Maybe they'll swim.

2355
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,319
We don't know.

2356
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:52,060
Okay.

2357
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,500
So now we have to stop what we're doing.

2358
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:59,020
All heroes on this tile will fight.

2359
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:01,579
It looks like we have four farmers helping us.

2360
01:46:01,579 --> 01:46:02,300
What?

2361
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,819
The Gorgons have come.

2362
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:09,739
Silence falls, emerging in their tortured shapes.

2363
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:13,659
The beasts only breathe and blink their oozing eyes.

2364
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,760
How should the defenders respond?

2365
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:19,920
Along us, I...

2366
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,039
Okay.

2367
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:24,399
Charge into battle and fight them.

2368
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:26,560
Use our knowledge of the land and harry their approach

2369
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,960
or stay here until the last moment and fight with cunning.

2370
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,479
I mean, my vote's going to be on that.

2371
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:33,039
I'd...

2372
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:35,039
We'll just jump out and surprise them

2373
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:36,960
and then we'll get the jump on them.

2374
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,380
Use any excuse to play hide and seek.

2375
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,539
Yeah, he loves hide and seek, dude.

2376
01:46:41,539 --> 01:46:42,770
Is it?

2377
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:44,449
Concealed amid their surroundings,

2378
01:46:44,449 --> 01:46:46,850
they elude the frustrated eyes of their enemy.

2379
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:50,939
Choosing the moment to strike is up to them.

2380
01:46:50,939 --> 01:46:51,819
Wait for it.

2381
01:46:51,819 --> 01:46:59,699
Okay, we all begin in stealth and we have flanking attacks.

2382
01:46:59,699 --> 01:47:02,130
Nice.

2383
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:04,289
Oh my god.

2384
01:47:04,289 --> 01:47:06,130
There are so many enemies.

2385
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:12,779
So I think we are actually going to be controlling the farmers too, I think.

2386
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:16,989
There's one up there.

2387
01:47:17,069 --> 01:47:19,699
Are there any in this room or no?

2388
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:20,340
No, no, no.

2389
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:20,739
We...

2390
01:47:20,739 --> 01:47:23,970
I think they were going to be coming from the top of the screen.

2391
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,529
Oh, no, they're not.

2392
01:47:24,529 --> 01:47:25,729
There's some below us too.

2393
01:47:25,729 --> 01:47:26,210
Oh, shit.

2394
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:26,529
Where?

2395
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:27,489
Oh, yeah, they're out down there.

2396
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:27,810
All right.

2397
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,689
I'm gonna...

2398
01:47:28,689 --> 01:47:31,819
I'm gonna make my way over there.

2399
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:32,460
Oh, god.

2400
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,020
Okay.

2401
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:34,210
There's a huge guy over here.

2402
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,569
Oh, there's a lot...

2403
01:47:35,569 --> 01:47:36,689
Oh, wait, where?

2404
01:47:36,689 --> 01:47:37,409
On the right.

2405
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,229
Is he down by me?

2406
01:47:39,229 --> 01:47:40,189
Oh, yeah, I see him.

2407
01:47:40,189 --> 01:47:42,590
You want me to move to intercept?

2408
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:45,229
We should probably prioritize this guy

2409
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:46,750
because I think there's enough...

2410
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:48,319
We have barricades, right?

2411
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,449
Sacrifice as many villagers as you can.

2412
01:47:52,449 --> 01:47:56,270
Wait, are you throwing the villages at the...

2413
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:57,149
Oh, fuck!

2414
01:47:57,149 --> 01:47:58,270
I didn't mean to do that.

2415
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:58,909
Oh, okay.

2416
01:47:58,909 --> 01:47:59,149
Yeah.

2417
01:47:59,949 --> 01:48:01,069
I thought I was...

2418
01:48:01,069 --> 01:48:01,710
All right, all right.

2419
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:02,689
We're okay.

2420
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:03,170
We're okay.

2421
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:07,069
I didn't realize I had all control of these people.

2422
01:48:07,069 --> 01:48:09,069
We just can send them anywhere, really.

2423
01:48:09,069 --> 01:48:13,869
We have control.

2424
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:15,710
Yeah, use them to block the barricades.

2425
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:16,189
Just have...

2426
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:16,829
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
01:48:16,829 --> 01:48:17,229
Just have...

2428
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:18,270
File the bodies.

2429
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:19,069
Oh, no.

2430
01:48:19,069 --> 01:48:19,789
Oh, my god.

2431
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:22,189
Wait, what?

2432
01:48:22,189 --> 01:48:22,909
They just jumped over?

2433
01:48:22,909 --> 01:48:23,630
I intercepted him.

2434
01:48:24,189 --> 01:48:24,430
Nice.

2435
01:48:25,149 --> 01:48:29,279
Uh-oh.

2436
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:29,520
Okay.

2437
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:31,899
They come from inside the houses.

2438
01:48:31,899 --> 01:48:33,340
Oh, my god.

2439
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,300
There's so many.

2440
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:37,979
Uh, okay.

2441
01:48:39,539 --> 01:48:39,779
I...

2442
01:48:40,579 --> 01:48:43,630
I'm going to infuse the cart.

2443
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:47,920
I'm going to try to do some damage over here.

2444
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,279
I'm going to double infuse it.

2445
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,560
No, I'm not.

2446
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,340
See if I can hurt these guys over here.

2447
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,659
Shit, it's not far enough.

2448
01:48:57,659 --> 01:49:04,189
Oh, there we go.

2449
01:49:04,189 --> 01:49:05,789
That didn't hurt that much.

2450
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:10,159
Wait, which one did you hit?

2451
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,039
Oh, back over there.

2452
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:13,359
I'm going to move, except the big guy, I think.

2453
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,170
Okay.

2454
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,640
Uh, blocked.

2455
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:22,960
Uh-oh.

2456
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,880
He's going to eat you.

2457
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,840
Bring this guy down here.

2458
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,260
Yeah.

2459
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:31,659
Good shot.

2460
01:49:31,659 --> 01:49:32,060
Good shot.

2461
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:36,369
Oh, no.

2462
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:38,369
No, kidding.

2463
01:49:38,369 --> 01:49:39,170
He's going to die.

2464
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,159
There are a lot of people down here.

2465
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,439
There's four enemies down here.

2466
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:44,560
How many are up top?

2467
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,520
There's two?

2468
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:45,760
One?

2469
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:47,329
There's one left.

2470
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:49,250
Thomas got grabbed.

2471
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:51,600
Oh, what do I do?

2472
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,140
Can you run or are you rooted?

2473
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:54,539
I don't think...

2474
01:49:54,539 --> 01:49:55,020
Am I not?

2475
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:55,500
I don't know.

2476
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:55,979
I don't...

2477
01:49:55,979 --> 01:49:56,619
I can't get over there.

2478
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,489
Can I go in the door?

2479
01:50:01,489 --> 01:50:02,130
Can you...

2480
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:02,930
Yeah.

2481
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:04,689
Open the door and then run through.

2482
01:50:04,689 --> 01:50:04,930
All right.

2483
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,939
I'm out of here.

2484
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:08,060
I'm not fucking with that.

2485
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:09,260
Oh, zoinks.

2486
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,600
Yeah.

2487
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,399
You guys do have like a Shaggy and Scooby vibe going on.

2488
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:21,010
Shit.

2489
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,050
Why did I shoot?

2490
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:22,609
Oh, my God.

2491
01:50:22,609 --> 01:50:23,569
I'm an idiot.

2492
01:50:23,569 --> 01:50:30,350
Here we go.

2493
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:30,670
All right.

2494
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:32,029
I feel a little bit safer.

2495
01:50:32,029 --> 01:50:33,229
Okay.

2496
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:36,979
Hard to tell who hasn't done things.

2497
01:50:36,979 --> 01:50:37,460
That's right.

2498
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,100
It would just...

2499
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,140
If someone hasn't acted,

2500
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,539
it would just jump to them once you've like had the turn.

2501
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:42,100
I think it's...

2502
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,859
Their portrait is not...

2503
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:45,779
It's just kind of lit up.

2504
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:46,100
Yeah.

2505
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:52,859
Let's get Katie to safety.

2506
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:53,260
Is that right?

2507
01:50:53,979 --> 01:50:54,460
Oh, no.

2508
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:54,859
Uh-oh.

2509
01:50:57,229 --> 01:50:58,029
Lost Staya.

2510
01:50:58,029 --> 01:50:59,069
Don't think we're...

2511
01:50:59,069 --> 01:50:59,869
Oh, no.

2512
01:50:59,869 --> 01:51:00,430
That's bad.

2513
01:51:03,149 --> 01:51:03,310
Okay.

2514
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:07,199
Can you throw that whole barricade at them or something?

2515
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,880
I can't select the barricade.

2516
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,600
Let me see if I can just...

2517
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,880
Let me walk back over here.

2518
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,739
Okay.

2519
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:14,220
I can...

2520
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:14,619
All right.

2521
01:51:14,619 --> 01:51:15,100
I can...

2522
01:51:15,739 --> 01:51:19,970
I'm going to try to throw the barricade like you said.

2523
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:20,289
All right.

2524
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:21,090
Uh...

2525
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:22,689
Blast.

2526
01:51:23,489 --> 01:51:25,739
What does this do?

2527
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:27,890
All right.

2528
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:28,369
I can do this.

2529
01:51:28,369 --> 01:51:29,329
This is going to hurt a lot.

2530
01:51:29,329 --> 01:51:34,449
Oh, nice.

2531
01:51:34,449 --> 01:51:35,729
Although I did get rid of the barricade.

2532
01:51:35,729 --> 01:51:36,529
I feel like that's bad.

2533
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:39,869
Don't know if that's a good idea or not.

2534
01:51:39,869 --> 01:51:41,550
We turned our defense into offense.

2535
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:41,869
Oh, my God.

2536
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:43,149
There's a giant furnace.

2537
01:51:43,229 --> 01:51:46,590
I'm going to put her in front of you so you don't die.

2538
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:48,510
Yeah, I need to move towards this fire

2539
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:51,890
because I want to pull up next turn.

2540
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:52,130
Wait.

2541
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:54,899
Nice.

2542
01:51:55,699 --> 01:51:58,859
Oh, he was untouchable because I killed him.

2543
01:51:58,859 --> 01:52:03,859
Cool.

2544
01:52:03,859 --> 01:52:04,340
Uh-oh.

2545
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:04,979
My blindness.

2546
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:06,659
I can't select this.

2547
01:52:06,659 --> 01:52:07,140
Shit.

2548
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:07,460
Sorry.

2549
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:13,100
Ooh.

2550
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:23,020
I love how the mage just kind of breaks objects in the world

2551
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:23,899
and throws it at people.

2552
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,689
Actually, that was...

2553
01:52:32,689 --> 01:52:33,489
We did a pretty good job.

2554
01:52:34,369 --> 01:52:35,250
Yeah, that was really good.

2555
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,250
Thomas.

2556
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,420
Level up.

2557
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,739
Thomas has grown stronger.

2558
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:43,869
OK.

2559
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:47,359
I like this one.

2560
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:54,930
Naturalist compulsion.

2561
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:57,250
Oh, yeah.

2562
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,050
You can move an enemy.

2563
01:52:59,859 --> 01:53:00,340
I like that.

2564
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,340
I think that's very useful.

2565
01:53:02,899 --> 01:53:04,340
Cool.

2566
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:04,659
All right.

2567
01:53:04,659 --> 01:53:06,659
So we quelled the invasion.

2568
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:09,939
Now we're just going to finish building the bridge.

2569
01:53:09,939 --> 01:53:11,140
Let's finish building that bridge.

2570
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:17,300
Yep.

2571
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:19,859
I can't believe that's what we actually were doing.

2572
01:53:21,819 --> 01:53:23,020
Build the bridge for the enemy.

2573
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,260
Yeah.

2574
01:53:29,539 --> 01:53:30,819
Year five.

2575
01:53:30,819 --> 01:53:32,460
OK.

2576
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,260
So that's a...

2577
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,500
It's a strength full or we can patrol and get it down.

2578
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,739
I feel like we could maybe handle a strength full though.

2579
01:53:37,739 --> 01:53:38,619
I think so.

2580
01:53:38,619 --> 01:53:41,090
I think we're gods among men.

2581
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,770
We're in year five at this point

2582
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,569
because Alongus took us on a two-year round trip.

2583
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:47,340
Sorry.

2584
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,380
We learned a lot.

2585
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:48,939
We...

2586
01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:49,500
Yeah, we did.

2587
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:51,260
Got some stuff.

2588
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,180
All right.

2589
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,699
You finally get to be in the game.

2590
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:57,489
So that's good.

2591
01:53:57,489 --> 01:53:57,649
Yeah.

2592
01:53:57,649 --> 01:53:57,890
Look.

2593
01:53:57,890 --> 01:54:00,699
I'm there.

2594
01:54:00,699 --> 01:54:03,340
Uh, you want me to keep going?

2595
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,350
You were...

2596
01:54:04,350 --> 01:54:04,829
I was...

2597
01:54:04,829 --> 01:54:05,920
I'm chewing.

2598
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,960
A ridge of limestone wraps the edge of Ghost Ring.

2599
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:14,029
Find a way from this direction and you'd have the high ground.

2600
01:54:14,029 --> 01:54:15,069
You'd have surprise.

2601
01:54:15,069 --> 01:54:18,750
I don't know.

2602
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:23,420
Looks impossible.

2603
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:24,539
Possibly.

2604
01:54:24,539 --> 01:54:31,420
But limestone is a rock full of surprises.

2605
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:36,289
After a few dead ends and false hopes.

2606
01:54:36,289 --> 01:54:37,869
I like that little snake.

2607
01:54:37,869 --> 01:54:42,909
Finally, a promising channel in the stone stretches out in the right direction.

2608
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:46,829
Probably carved by an ancient stream.

2609
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:52,590
See, limestone is a note worthy that when repeatedly exposed to water.

2610
01:54:52,590 --> 01:54:54,939
What?

2611
01:54:54,939 --> 01:54:57,119
Seems sturdy enough.

2612
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:58,319
I think you just got trapped.

2613
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:02,239
You got lost in a thought there and we just kind of just didn't even think to interject.

2614
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,479
Yeah, his wolfy ramblings.

2615
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:06,529
You doing okay back there?

2616
01:55:06,529 --> 01:55:13,920
It's kind of tight here, isn't it?

2617
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,239
Not all of us are made of wet noodles and silk.

2618
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:16,960
Some of us got...

2619
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,390
Warrior shoulders.

2620
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:25,810
Hey, perfect.

2621
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:27,090
Here we are.

2622
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:29,569
Couldn't ask for a better spot to emerge.

2623
01:55:29,569 --> 01:55:33,680
Just one last squeeze and it's a straight shot to Ghost Ring.

2624
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:39,199
I mean, I could ask for a slightly better spot to emerge.

2625
01:55:40,989 --> 01:55:42,750
Maybe one that was a little bigger.

2626
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:50,529
You're so hard for you to maneuver.

2627
01:55:59,409 --> 01:56:00,210
Should we pull him?

2628
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,850
Should we grab him and pull him through?

2629
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,810
You got this.

2630
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:04,850
You're a panther.

2631
01:56:05,489 --> 01:56:06,289
You're...

2632
01:56:06,289 --> 01:56:10,420
If anyone asks, tell them I went down honorably.

2633
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:15,680
You're not gonna die here, are you?

2634
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:22,109
I have a 43% chance to push through or I'm literally gonna go around.

2635
01:56:22,109 --> 01:56:22,989
We have to push through.

2636
01:56:22,989 --> 01:56:27,119
I'm too stubborn.

2637
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,880
You sure there's nothing we can do?

2638
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,899
Standing back might be best.

2639
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:39,779
And then twists and tightens in each turn.

2640
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:40,979
I hope you lose the other eye.

2641
01:56:42,699 --> 01:56:51,229
Was damn right for a pubic.

2642
01:56:51,229 --> 01:56:52,029
All right, we did it.

2643
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:54,239
Kill them.

2644
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:55,920
Oh, our crit chance is doubled.

2645
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,729
All right.

2646
01:57:01,729 --> 01:57:05,409
Also, yes, something you guys might not be aware of is if you stand next to each other,

2647
01:57:05,409 --> 01:57:07,890
you get like a defensive bonus.

2648
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:09,170
You'll see like a little shield up here.

2649
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:09,970
Oh, that's true.

2650
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:11,970
Cohesiveness?

2651
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:15,579
Yeah.

2652
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:20,529
And I started blasting.

2653
01:57:29,630 --> 01:57:31,069
Oh, scalding rain.

2654
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:34,539
Oh, this is gonna be insane.

2655
01:57:34,539 --> 01:57:34,779
All right.

2656
01:57:34,779 --> 01:57:35,659
Who am I doing this to?

2657
01:57:36,819 --> 01:57:37,060
You.

2658
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:41,819
That was a pretty cool move.

2659
01:57:41,819 --> 01:57:42,539
It's because it's a well.

2660
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:45,939
Oh, you heat it up with the fire stuff.

2661
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:55,220
Okay.

2662
01:57:55,220 --> 01:58:00,060
Let's do it again.

2663
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,420
Time for my secret move.

2664
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:07,949
What does that do?

2665
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:10,420
This makes you be able to move fast.

2666
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:12,180
It's like an RP thing.

2667
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,220
We get plus two movement, I think, when he howls.

2668
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,579
That's helpful.

2669
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:26,739
I'm going to do this fucking bite it.

2670
01:58:29,779 --> 01:58:34,619
It was a pig after all.

2671
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:37,250
Oh, I was just keep doing it.

2672
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,829
Oh, he blocked water.

2673
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:41,949
Bullshit.

2674
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:47,659
There's a lot.

2675
01:58:47,659 --> 01:58:47,899
Nice.

2676
01:58:48,779 --> 01:58:50,829
All right.

2677
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:59,100
Now, I wish my name was cool like dogwood.

2678
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:01,180
A snake stone sash.

2679
01:59:01,819 --> 01:59:03,500
Dodge plus five dodge.

2680
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:07,859
Are you going?

2681
01:59:07,859 --> 01:59:10,340
My dodge is criminally low because I've got my big armor.

2682
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:13,779
So I think it's kind of pointless for me to have it if Thomas wants it.

2683
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:14,260
I'll take it.

2684
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:15,300
Yeah.

2685
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,340
Calamity.

2686
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,359
All right.

2687
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:25,119
Now, there's hordes of raccoons.

2688
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:31,039
Yeah, the Gorgons are absolutely stacked right now.

2689
01:59:32,029 --> 01:59:33,260
Yeah, they are.

2690
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:33,579
Okay.

2691
01:59:33,579 --> 01:59:36,619
Do you want to secure ghost ring to find an item or should we press on?

2692
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:38,449
Oh, look.

2693
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:41,010
All of the achievements have been done.

2694
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:44,609
We can now assault life from where we can go all the way back.

2695
01:59:44,609 --> 01:59:45,090
Should we go?

2696
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:47,170
I'd love a walk.

2697
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:47,569
I think.

2698
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:50,850
Yeah, let's go for it.

2699
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,609
Do we want to get some items before we go?

2700
01:59:53,569 --> 01:59:54,930
By like securing.

2701
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:56,609
I mean, there's no harm in securing, right?

2702
01:59:57,170 --> 01:59:59,359
Yeah, it's just a little bit more time passes.

2703
01:59:59,359 --> 01:59:59,760
It's okay.

2704
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,239
I'm in the mood for some scaring and discovery.

2705
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:04,079
We can sit in this place right as we go, can't we?

2706
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:05,939
All right.

2707
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:07,140
Yeah, let's find an item.

2708
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:12,449
Might as well.

2709
02:00:12,449 --> 02:00:15,250
32 days.

2710
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:17,010
That's a long time.

2711
02:00:24,029 --> 02:00:24,989
Keep your heroes busy.

2712
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:26,979
Oh, we're not.

2713
02:00:26,979 --> 02:00:27,380
Okay.

2714
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:27,859
There we go.

2715
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,060
Oh, I see.

2716
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:34,770
Oh, God.

2717
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:35,329
Okay.

2718
02:00:36,369 --> 02:00:37,810
A little scary, but that's okay.

2719
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:38,609
I think we can handle it.

2720
02:00:39,329 --> 02:00:39,569
Yeah.

2721
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:43,859
Let them come.

2722
02:00:43,859 --> 02:00:45,220
It's a new faction that was.

2723
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:49,390
Happy birthday, everybody.

2724
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:50,270
Is it whose birthday?

2725
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:51,390
Is there somebody's birthday in chat?

2726
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:52,029
Happy birthday.

2727
02:00:52,029 --> 02:00:52,989
Happy birthday.

2728
02:00:52,989 --> 02:00:53,710
Happy birthday.

2729
02:00:56,109 --> 02:01:00,350
It strikes me how much there is still to find to know I am inspired.

2730
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,000
Wood.

2731
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:09,199
We got three wood and a gloom gloss strap, which is this is crit chance.

2732
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,640
Fine.

2733
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:11,409
Thank you.

2734
02:01:11,409 --> 02:01:12,050
Fine.

2735
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:12,369
Take it.

2736
02:01:12,369 --> 02:01:14,449
Oh, it is a is a wolfy thing, isn't it?

2737
02:01:14,449 --> 02:01:14,850
Excuse me.

2738
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:16,770
We need before greed.

2739
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:17,890
We need to need roll on that.

2740
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:21,729
That's actually I was going to slash roll one to a hundred.

2741
02:01:21,729 --> 02:01:22,590
Whatever.

2742
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:23,710
So we kind of messed up.

2743
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:24,270
That's cool.

2744
02:01:24,270 --> 02:01:25,390
That's called ninja looting.

2745
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,109
What you just did.

2746
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,130
Well, you guys can have fun in dragon flight.

2747
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:35,260
I don't have dragon flight.

2748
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:36,779
Dude, I'm sorry.

2749
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:38,300
I do, but I'd rather play Doctyde.

2750
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:40,670
True.

2751
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:43,789
None of us knew what had changed the beasts.

2752
02:01:43,789 --> 02:01:47,310
We could not change ourselves, so we blamed the beasts.

2753
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:51,069
We knew something lived inside of them.

2754
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:56,640
Blue burning hate that frenzied them, then left them still.

2755
02:01:57,359 --> 02:01:59,550
A stone sentence.

2756
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:02,909
Worse and more deadly than any venom.

2757
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:10,020
Today, we would finally find out where it came from and why it wouldn't stop.

2758
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:10,340
Hold on.

2759
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:10,979
Go back for a sec.

2760
02:02:13,890 --> 02:02:15,970
Like this is really framed.

2761
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:18,539
Like you get a long shot from you.

2762
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:18,859
Yeah.

2763
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:19,739
Yeah.

2764
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,380
We hired a ship photographer for our adventure.

2765
02:02:26,449 --> 02:02:30,159
Okay. Yeah, we can go.

2766
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:33,600
Well, Lithgram Air Engine looks mostly intact.

2767
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:38,140
Maybe the rumors aren't true.

2768
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:43,869
It wouldn't make much sense given all we've seen.

2769
02:02:48,979 --> 02:02:52,590
Personally, I'm done expecting things to go smoothie.

2770
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:53,710
Taps eye patch.

2771
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:58,479
Yeah, I'm with you.

2772
02:02:58,479 --> 02:03:01,199
Why is this town named Lithgram Air Engine?

2773
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:08,449
What the fuck is an air engine?

2774
02:03:08,449 --> 02:03:10,050
It's completely silent.

2775
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,750
Except for this.

2776
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:16,350
Oh, no, we have to explore the town.

2777
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:17,310
That's literally our thing.

2778
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:17,550
All right.

2779
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:18,510
I'll check this house.

2780
02:03:18,909 --> 02:03:21,279
House looks good.

2781
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:25,140
What's going on here?

2782
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:32,500
I'll check the one on the right.

2783
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:36,449
Anything in there?

2784
02:03:36,449 --> 02:03:37,470
Nothing.

2785
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:39,119
Green bags.

2786
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:39,680
Wait.

2787
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:40,239
Oh, no.

2788
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,279
What's wrong?

2789
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:42,720
Have the villagers turned to stone?

2790
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,539
Look.

2791
02:03:43,539 --> 02:03:49,069
Oh, petrified.

2792
02:03:49,069 --> 02:03:50,270
Beyond our help now.

2793
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,510
Yeah.

2794
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,859
Oh, my goodness.

2795
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:04,159
As horrific as it is fascinating.

2796
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,119
What could have done this?

2797
02:04:10,930 --> 02:04:12,430
There's tracks.

2798
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:14,430
They go up to that barn door.

2799
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:15,869
Too many buildings around.

2800
02:04:15,869 --> 02:04:16,989
No idea what could be waiting for us.

2801
02:04:16,989 --> 02:04:21,630
And whatever did this could still be inside.

2802
02:04:24,689 --> 02:04:28,510
Hey, they come.

2803
02:04:38,739 --> 02:04:40,659
Stop doing the protagonist voice.

2804
02:04:40,659 --> 02:04:41,300
I'm sorry.

2805
02:04:45,859 --> 02:04:46,100
Thanks.

2806
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:46,979
I'm staying next to this fire.

2807
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:48,260
I'm going to be throwing it to people.

2808
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,300
I'm just going to wait here.

2809
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:55,470
I'm going to extinguish the fire.

2810
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:56,699
Don't do that.

2811
02:04:56,699 --> 02:04:57,260
I need.

2812
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:02,100
Where are you going?

2813
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:02,579
What are you thinking?

2814
02:05:04,449 --> 02:05:07,789
Perfect.

2815
02:05:07,789 --> 02:05:10,960
All right.

2816
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,399
Who's priority?

2817
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:13,859
What's priority here?

2818
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:26,300
Probably the raccoons because they're ranged.

2819
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:27,659
They're out of range for me here.

2820
02:05:27,659 --> 02:05:29,100
Wait, can I?

2821
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:30,140
Wait, what did I do?

2822
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:31,180
I'm going in.

2823
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:34,020
Yeah, they're too far.

2824
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:34,899
They're a little too far.

2825
02:05:34,899 --> 02:05:36,100
They need to be a little bit closer for this.

2826
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:37,380
But I can do this.

2827
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:45,310
I think you could walk and throw attached to the fire now.

2828
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:46,189
Oh, I'm right.

2829
02:05:46,189 --> 02:05:46,750
I'm attached.

2830
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:48,029
I forgot I could move.

2831
02:05:48,029 --> 02:05:49,869
For some reason, I thought I'd be still next to it.

2832
02:05:49,869 --> 02:05:50,930
All right, here we go.

2833
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:53,489
I still can't.

2834
02:05:53,489 --> 02:05:56,449
Oh, maybe it's the limit.

2835
02:05:56,449 --> 02:05:57,569
Fire is the range.

2836
02:05:58,449 --> 02:06:07,250
OK, well, I'll just do this.

2837
02:06:07,250 --> 02:06:08,449
You eat almonds on stream.

2838
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,130
A bunch of movement.

2839
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:12,050
So I'm going to I'm just going to run over here.

2840
02:06:12,609 --> 02:06:17,090
All right.

2841
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:19,869
Oh, everyone came to my rescue.

2842
02:06:19,869 --> 02:06:20,829
I want them to shoot me.

2843
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:22,979
Oh, my God.

2844
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:24,420
That was one hit kill.

2845
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:26,510
It wasn't even your turn, right?

2846
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:28,029
You just did that because it shot you.

2847
02:06:28,029 --> 02:06:29,390
Yeah, it was my first level up.

2848
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:32,989
I guess because it shot him and we're connected that I'm able to shoot back.

2849
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:35,779
I'm going to kill it.

2850
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:36,260
It does.

2851
02:06:36,819 --> 02:06:38,100
I think I can hit this guy now.

2852
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:41,659
He's just out of range.

2853
02:06:41,659 --> 02:06:41,979
Really?

2854
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:49,979
Yeah, he's out of range still.

2855
02:06:49,979 --> 02:07:01,970
Let's wait till he gets closer.

2856
02:07:02,609 --> 02:07:11,550
Coming out.

2857
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:12,750
Oh, good that you grabbed me.

2858
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,159
All right.

2859
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:16,640
There we go.

2860
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,460
Oh, this is going to be big.

2861
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:20,100
Instead of you.

2862
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:23,340
How do you block fire?

2863
02:07:23,899 --> 02:07:24,859
It's an element.

2864
02:07:25,579 --> 02:07:28,460
I don't know, but I'm going to keep him here.

2865
02:07:31,939 --> 02:07:33,060
That was good.

2866
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:34,979
Swap to the wand.

2867
02:07:34,979 --> 02:07:36,340
I have it out already, don't I?

2868
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,359
Yeah, you have out.

2869
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:40,819
Propaganda.

2870
02:07:40,819 --> 02:07:44,500
You got that raging coming in behind you as well.

2871
02:07:45,539 --> 02:07:50,539
I mean, look out behind you.

2872
02:07:50,539 --> 02:07:52,619
I'm going sicko mode.

2873
02:07:59,199 --> 02:07:59,520
All right.

2874
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,640
Thornfang.

2875
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:09,260
I wonder if we save these people.

2876
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:16,430
Damn.

2877
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:18,750
Oh, yellow knife.

2878
02:08:25,869 --> 02:08:28,989
Oh, whoa.

2879
02:08:28,989 --> 02:08:29,789
All right, I'm going to move.

2880
02:08:31,149 --> 02:08:32,770
I'm coming down here.

2881
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:37,939
Thank you.

2882
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,560
Why can't I use the fire?

2883
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,640
When you use it, you threw the fire itself.

2884
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:53,279
Oh, the fire itself was thrown.

2885
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:55,039
All right, I'm going to move this one over here.

2886
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:59,220
What do I want to move you to?

2887
02:09:02,659 --> 02:09:03,060
Never mind.

2888
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:03,939
They're dead.

2889
02:09:03,939 --> 02:09:06,800
Really?

2890
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:07,760
I can't really.

2891
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,899
I guess I could infuse with like this.

2892
02:09:10,699 --> 02:09:14,340
I'm out of actions now.

2893
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:18,029
Sicko mode.

2894
02:09:18,029 --> 02:09:18,989
How do you move people?

2895
02:09:18,989 --> 02:09:19,390
I wonder.

2896
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:32,220
Oh, big damage.

2897
02:09:32,779 --> 02:09:37,180
OK, where was the bomb?

2898
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:39,100
Because it was all the way to the right.

2899
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:42,430
OK, let's start heading there.

2900
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:44,590
I think that's where the beast will come from.

2901
02:09:45,149 --> 02:09:55,840
I got to defuse.

2902
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:00,159
There's tentacles coming out of this thing.

2903
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:06,720
It's probably going to be a boss in here.

2904
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:07,840
Yeah.

2905
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:12,140
I don't know if you guys want to get too close.

2906
02:10:12,140 --> 02:10:13,100
If you want to set up over there.

2907
02:10:13,659 --> 02:10:14,939
Sicko mode.

2908
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,220
He's just going in.

2909
02:10:20,109 --> 02:10:22,750
I'm just I don't want to get hit by whatever opens this door.

2910
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:26,369
OK, I think we I'm just going to wait a time and then we'll open next time.

2911
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,579
Oh, the Gorgon.

2912
02:10:30,579 --> 02:10:34,479
The silent slithering approach fascinates the mind and haunts the heart.

2913
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:37,520
Oh, shit.

2914
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:37,760
OK.

2915
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:39,739
Anything in there?

2916
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,319
Let's find out.

2917
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,340
Can't see anything.

2918
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:52,689
12 health.

2919
02:10:52,689 --> 02:10:55,649
Wait, I think I think I can illuminate something.

2920
02:10:55,649 --> 02:10:57,630
I could try or I could just.

2921
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:58,510
Oh, God.

2922
02:10:58,510 --> 02:10:59,069
Oh, God.

2923
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:03,279
I'm surrounded.

2924
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:04,479
OK.

2925
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:04,880
OK.

2926
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:05,199
OK.

2927
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:19,020
He fucked me.

2928
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:20,140
Why did it so that I'd have him?

2929
02:11:20,779 --> 02:11:21,899
They got he dodged.

2930
02:11:21,899 --> 02:11:22,619
I guess.

2931
02:11:22,619 --> 02:11:22,939
Yeah.

2932
02:11:22,939 --> 02:11:25,340
No, I gain an action when I kill things, but that's probably better.

2933
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:33,760
Oh, I've got you, Thomas.

2934
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:36,210
Nice.

2935
02:11:39,659 --> 02:11:41,020
Remember when I was a guy.

2936
02:11:50,989 --> 02:11:51,710
Come on, guys.

2937
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,189
Finish him.

2938
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:56,619
I tried to move him.

2939
02:11:56,619 --> 02:11:57,739
Wait, did you see that?

2940
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:00,510
You did a big amount of damage.

2941
02:12:01,149 --> 02:12:02,909
No, because it attacked Thomas last time.

2942
02:12:02,909 --> 02:12:04,909
He got plus four damage for lover's vengeance.

2943
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,909
Yeah, I've been getting that.

2944
02:12:06,909 --> 02:12:07,229
Really?

2945
02:12:07,949 --> 02:12:08,109
Yeah.

2946
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:09,869
I fucking love you, dude.

2947
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:14,029
Let's give that to Thomas because that will take his bonus damage up by one.

2948
02:12:14,029 --> 02:12:14,829
Mario noise.

2949
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,510
Did I just do a Mario noise?

2950
02:12:19,069 --> 02:12:20,590
I'm a Blue Horn warrior.

2951
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:21,789
OK.

2952
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:26,159
I can force a photo attack me.

2953
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,920
My melee attacks just deal one damage.

2954
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:30,800
That sounds pretty good.

2955
02:12:32,739 --> 02:12:35,619
My melee attacks deal more based on the health I'm missing.

2956
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:41,920
These all sound kind of good.

2957
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,000
Yeah, I kind of like viciousness.

2958
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,760
Just one more damage.

2959
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:50,130
You never go wrong with extra damage.

2960
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:52,770
Sentinel looks like if I charge someone, it steals their movements.

2961
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:53,810
They can't get to you guys.

2962
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,689
But if you just kill them.

2963
02:12:58,689 --> 02:12:59,409
Yeah, you're right.

2964
02:13:02,739 --> 02:13:03,939
That could have gone worse.

2965
02:13:04,899 --> 02:13:10,050
Yeah, but it's certainly not your standard plow mule.

2966
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:15,380
The hulking carcass steams from its many wounds.

2967
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:19,460
Hideous convulsions course along its appendages to the extremities of its body.

2968
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:37,390
Then why you know the things tremendous tail flicks across the barn.

2969
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:40,270
It plucks up in on like he's a straw doll.

2970
02:13:40,270 --> 02:13:43,949
His weapons falling uselessly from his hands as it pulls him in.

2971
02:13:46,930 --> 02:13:47,729
Don't panic.

2972
02:13:48,289 --> 02:13:51,739
A voice leaks from a non's mouth.

2973
02:13:52,699 --> 02:13:54,220
It's a wrong voice.

2974
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:58,460
Weird and discordant, like some fretting and plucking in a fiddle.

2975
02:13:58,460 --> 02:13:59,500
Who's ever picked one up?

2976
02:14:01,979 --> 02:14:06,060
Still yourselves, bone stacks.

2977
02:14:06,939 --> 02:14:10,220
This one speaks my words.

2978
02:14:11,489 --> 02:14:12,130
I shoot him.

2979
02:14:14,779 --> 02:14:18,060
I can make it die.

2980
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:28,500
You are not alike to us.

2981
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:31,779
Weak lungs, small minds.

2982
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:35,779
Stacks of splintering bones.

2983
02:14:36,579 --> 02:14:40,659
Thin blood that will so readily betray you.

2984
02:14:41,539 --> 02:14:44,260
Why flail for your lives?

2985
02:14:44,979 --> 02:14:46,979
So noisy.

2986
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:52,590
Be wise now.

2987
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:54,270
Will you survive if you hurt him?

2988
02:14:56,380 --> 02:15:00,859
You think I flail for life as you do?

2989
02:15:01,819 --> 02:15:03,979
I am Gorgon.

2990
02:15:04,779 --> 02:15:11,100
The master Ulsterix has promised us silence.

2991
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:15,340
The voice dissolves into a sound like rain or distant waves.

2992
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:18,140
Wriggling grips tighten.

2993
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:20,300
A tentacle invades in his ear.

2994
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:23,500
Stop.

2995
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,319
I really gave that one my all.

2996
02:15:27,789 --> 02:15:29,789
Thomas leaps forward in an instant.

2997
02:15:29,789 --> 02:15:32,430
Rusty saw leaps off the iron book hooks.

2998
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:34,829
Metal ribbiting and rippling loudly.

2999
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:36,430
Stop, I said.

3000
02:15:36,989 --> 02:15:41,840
Are you using your magic power to throw a sword?

3001
02:15:47,569 --> 02:15:54,619
The saw slices into the neck of the great beast.

3002
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,659
As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's-

3003
02:16:03,659 --> 02:16:05,180
Wait, go back a scene, go back a scene.

3004
02:16:05,819 --> 02:16:06,779
Look what happened to my face.

3005
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,939
Look at the blue on my face.

3006
02:16:09,739 --> 02:16:11,579
Yes, you're going to be the next Marvel hero.

3007
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:14,529
Is this my origin story?

3008
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:16,460
Your eye's going to grow back.

3009
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:20,380
As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's demise,

3010
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:23,260
Thomas supports Inon, helping him to stand.

3011
02:16:24,859 --> 02:16:27,100
Somebody said, you're only useful in cutscenes.

3012
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:29,739
I'm doing okay, all right?

3013
02:16:30,779 --> 02:16:31,340
You're okay.

3014
02:16:31,979 --> 02:16:35,360
A strange stony affliction spreads from Inon's ear.

3015
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:37,540
Inon?

3016
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:44,100
This isn't over.

3017
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:47,729
I saw his mind.

3018
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:50,370
The stone was in his heart.

3019
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:54,100
Inon takes the stone from a longus's palm,

3020
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:55,219
turning it in front of his eyes,

3021
02:16:55,219 --> 02:16:57,940
catching the slender sunbeams that slice the barn wall.

3022
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:01,059
The strange, polyhedral stone is slick with the Gorgon's blood.

3023
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:02,739
Epichrist.

3024
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,079
Each face is graven with an intricate image.

3025
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:14,379
The word in the Gorgon's head was epichrist.

3026
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:19,899
This tan, livergram air engine.

3027
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:22,940
These petrified people, even this monster,

3028
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:25,979
they're insignificant in the coming epoch.

3029
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:30,379
The epichrist glistens, sticky and blue.

3030
02:17:31,549 --> 02:17:33,549
The Gorgons have a master.

3031
02:17:33,549 --> 02:17:34,750
Ulstrix, it's called.

3032
02:17:35,309 --> 02:17:38,750
He's looking for something, some myth or secret.

3033
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:40,270
I think the riddle is in the stone.

3034
02:17:42,350 --> 02:17:44,989
I think we have to find out what he wants.

3035
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:47,629
And make sure he doesn't get it.

3036
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:51,260
I think we should, we all I think said that collectively.

3037
02:17:52,059 --> 02:17:52,559
Yeah.

3038
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:56,219
So I lost a bunch of charisma because I got a fucked up face

3039
02:17:56,219 --> 02:17:57,659
and became a gigaloner.

3040
02:17:58,219 --> 02:18:00,940
And Thomas gained 10 years on his career.

3041
02:18:02,850 --> 02:18:03,649
That works for me.

3042
02:18:03,649 --> 02:18:05,409
One of us came off better.

3043
02:18:07,069 --> 02:18:09,389
Okay, so that is chapter one done.

3044
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:12,989
So now it kind of tells us all the resources

3045
02:18:12,989 --> 02:18:15,940
and it says 10 years of peace follow.

3046
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,709
10 years of peace.

3047
02:18:17,709 --> 02:18:18,909
Yeah, we did that.

3048
02:18:19,709 --> 02:18:20,989
So we lose some cards.

3049
02:18:20,989 --> 02:18:24,030
They lose some cards because 10 years of peace.

3050
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:25,469
During the years of peace.

3051
02:18:25,469 --> 02:18:26,770
What happened?

3052
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:31,340
The Gorgon's Mark grew and crusted over to cover one side of Inan's face.

3053
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:33,579
It would be a grim reminder of the encounter that day

3054
02:18:33,579 --> 02:18:35,020
in the lithogram air engine barn.

3055
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:36,379
Good job I'm blind on that side.

3056
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:38,299
Yeah, that's true.

3057
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:41,229
On his more civilized days,

3058
02:18:41,229 --> 02:18:44,270
Alongus would drop into town for gossip and tool repairs.

3059
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:50,030
But on the whole, he felt clear headed among his wilder kin.

3060
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:51,950
Now that the job wasn't quite as dangerous,

3061
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:53,709
Alongus became a guide to travelers

3062
02:18:53,709 --> 02:18:58,370
crossing the more treacherous stretches of the swamp and the mountain.

3063
02:18:58,370 --> 02:19:00,930
Thomas and Alongus were married and one winter night

3064
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:05,090
they held an ancient and evocative ceremony that Alongus had read of.

3065
02:19:05,090 --> 02:19:06,690
A feast followed.

3066
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:10,530
The people of Sleeping Top were startled but pleased at the generosity.

3067
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,729
Thomas displayed that night.

3068
02:19:12,209 --> 02:19:13,969
Alongus would always remember the moment

3069
02:19:13,969 --> 02:19:17,250
like a scene brought to life from history, from legend.

3070
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:23,700
And he, he and Thomas indelibly written into the world's pages.

3071
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:24,819
Transformations.

3072
02:19:24,819 --> 02:19:29,139
You have a choice to advance Alongus's transformation and get a wolf arm.

3073
02:19:29,139 --> 02:19:32,260
You'll be able to get a wolf claw for five to eight damage.

3074
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,100
Yeah.

3075
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:34,500
Okay.

3076
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:37,860
Oh, you got like a whole inventory page, yeah.

3077
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:41,219
Yeah, so basically you can see our current resources in the top left

3078
02:19:41,219 --> 02:19:43,459
and then we can click whichever player we want

3079
02:19:43,459 --> 02:19:44,659
and we can kind of kit them out.

3080
02:19:45,389 --> 02:19:46,270
With new upgrades.

3081
02:19:46,270 --> 02:19:48,989
So if we wanted to make you like a tier two bow

3082
02:19:48,989 --> 02:19:52,190
it would use up four hotwoods, an ingot, a hide, a fabric.

3083
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:54,270
We could craft it and then give it to you.

3084
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:56,590
So it's kind of like what are we missing?

3085
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:57,229
What do we need?

3086
02:19:57,229 --> 02:19:57,870
That kind of thing.

3087
02:19:59,819 --> 02:20:01,819
I would say looking at our stuff

3088
02:20:01,819 --> 02:20:04,219
Thomas is the only one that doesn't have any armor.

3089
02:20:04,219 --> 02:20:05,840
So maybe we-

3090
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:06,559
I don't, yeah.

3091
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:13,299
Like maybe we click this and maybe we want to craft Thomas like a dusty drab

3092
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,540
or an ember gown.

3093
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:17,379
Which one of these like do you like the look of?

3094
02:20:18,989 --> 02:20:19,389
Let's see.

3095
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:27,950
And so for every piece of like resource we're missing

3096
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,309
we can spend an LP.

3097
02:20:29,309 --> 02:20:30,430
So we only have one fabric

3098
02:20:30,430 --> 02:20:33,229
but we can use an LP to make an extra fabric.

3099
02:20:33,229 --> 02:20:36,270
So these two star ones are expensive.

3100
02:20:37,629 --> 02:20:39,139
Yeah, we can click it and look.

3101
02:20:39,139 --> 02:20:41,299
So that would be- it would cost us three LP

3102
02:20:41,299 --> 02:20:43,860
but I think that's fine if you wanted to go for that.

3103
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:46,739
I mean this drab, this two star drab seems like it's pretty good.

3104
02:20:46,739 --> 02:20:48,260
Three armor, two warning, one spell damage.

3105
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,059
All right, yeah.

3106
02:20:49,059 --> 02:20:50,340
So just click craft.

3107
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:52,770
Oh yeah.

3108
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:56,500
Let's go.

3109
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:57,979
There you go.

3110
02:20:57,979 --> 02:20:59,280
Snare your kid out.

3111
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:01,809
Sweet.

3112
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:04,110
So we've got a bunch of stuff left.

3113
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:07,860
Let's have a look what we could do.

3114
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:11,440
Would you rather have like a bow over like armor?

3115
02:21:14,139 --> 02:21:17,020
I want a dueling sword so I can be a rapier wielding wolf.

3116
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:19,620
It just makes sense.

3117
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:20,120
Okay.

3118
02:21:22,659 --> 02:21:25,620
As a ranger you can use a dueling sword up here

3119
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:28,100
so we can make the giant scratch.

3120
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:28,600
Yeah.

3121
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:34,459
Or we could make the dueling sword.

3122
02:21:34,459 --> 02:21:35,979
There's only one damage difference

3123
02:21:35,979 --> 02:21:36,860
and this one cost nine.

3124
02:21:38,139 --> 02:21:39,180
I'm making it.

3125
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:41,889
Okay, you're making the tier two or the tier one?

3126
02:21:41,889 --> 02:21:42,690
Tier two.

3127
02:21:42,690 --> 02:21:46,530
You have such a cool character.

3128
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:47,030
Okay.

3129
02:21:47,809 --> 02:21:48,690
And on go first.

3130
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:53,649
I think Anna needs just a big weapon.

3131
02:21:53,649 --> 02:21:56,819
I think I need a better than this spear.

3132
02:21:56,819 --> 02:21:58,659
What we got?

3133
02:21:58,659 --> 02:22:01,540
I'm thinking like a gray axe or something.

3134
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:08,899
Ooh, like a mace maybe?

3135
02:22:08,899 --> 02:22:10,239
Do we have a hammer?

3136
02:22:10,239 --> 02:22:13,170
Yeah, gray axe or a great sword.

3137
02:22:13,170 --> 02:22:20,260
You think I'm more of a hammer guy or do you think I'm like a...

3138
02:22:23,299 --> 02:22:23,780
I don't know.

3139
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,540
I feel like this is a hammer.

3140
02:22:29,489 --> 02:22:31,459
You're going to turn into a golem.

3141
02:22:31,459 --> 02:22:34,340
Golems are required by law to use hammers and maces.

3142
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:39,969
That's just how it goes.

3143
02:22:39,969 --> 02:22:41,729
Golem with an axe, you're going to get laughed at.

3144
02:22:47,889 --> 02:22:49,569
Although great axe works too.

3145
02:22:49,569 --> 02:22:54,270
If we craft this we can only make the tier one rapier though.

3146
02:22:54,270 --> 02:22:54,909
We can't have that.

3147
02:22:54,909 --> 02:22:56,030
Star has to have the best weapon.

3148
02:22:57,229 --> 02:22:57,870
That's fine.

3149
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:05,379
The mountain break.

3150
02:23:05,379 --> 02:23:06,180
That's what it's named.

3151
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:07,139
I'm going to reroll it.

3152
02:23:07,139 --> 02:23:10,020
Tower sludger.

3153
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:11,120
Yes.

3154
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:11,760
Ooh.

3155
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,540
Okay.

3156
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:13,979
And then we've got this boy.

3157
02:23:13,979 --> 02:23:14,620
We can actually...

3158
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:16,379
So you want a dueling sword?

3159
02:23:16,459 --> 02:23:21,040
We can make you a dueling sword and we could also make you a tier two crossbow.

3160
02:23:29,489 --> 02:23:32,159
Oh, I got disconnected.

3161
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:34,559
We're out of money for ingots.

3162
02:23:34,559 --> 02:23:35,840
Why did I get disconnected?

3163
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,040
We can use LP though.

3164
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:37,440
I don't know.

3165
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:39,200
Why are you running?

3166
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,399
We can save and remake.

3167
02:23:40,399 --> 02:23:42,319
I think you could just rejoin actually.

3168
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:43,360
Can I just rejoin?

3169
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,770
I think so.

3170
02:23:44,770 --> 02:23:46,139
Let me try and rejoin.

3171
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:49,329
Okay, disconnect.

3172
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:56,319
It's thinking.

3173
02:23:56,319 --> 02:24:01,090
I think it might be crashing.

3174
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:01,729
Okay.

3175
02:24:01,729 --> 02:24:04,770
Should I just do play or my legacy?

3176
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:10,799
There's this play and there's also my legacy.

3177
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:12,239
Do I have to select that character maybe?

3178
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:14,829
I'm not sure.

3179
02:24:14,829 --> 02:24:16,350
I think we can remake the lobby.

3180
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:17,870
I can just save and we can remake it.

3181
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:21,579
Okay.

3182
02:24:21,579 --> 02:24:25,520
Let's let our boy build what he needs though.

3183
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,479
I finished building that.

3184
02:24:26,479 --> 02:24:27,440
I clicked next.

3185
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:28,860
Okay, let's do...

3186
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:29,500
Okay.

3187
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:31,620
Last save was three seconds ago.

3188
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:32,979
Steam maintenance Tuesday.

3189
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:35,700
Oh, that's what it is.

3190
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:37,299
Is that what it actually is?

3191
02:24:37,299 --> 02:24:38,500
It's going to get all of us, yeah.

3192
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:38,979
Oh, no.

3193
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:41,950
It only takes like five minutes or so.

3194
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:42,450
Yeah.

3195
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:49,700
Five minute break.

3196
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:53,860
I don't know if you guys can even see this or if I can save.

3197
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:54,659
I don't...

3198
02:24:54,659 --> 02:24:56,739
Boy, you know, Strippin was the leader, I think.

3199
02:24:56,739 --> 02:24:57,059
So do you...

3200
02:24:57,059 --> 02:24:58,739
Save and quit is currently grayed out.

3201
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:01,219
But it saved 30 seconds ago.

3202
02:25:01,219 --> 02:25:01,780
So...

3203
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:06,020
So are all of our characters on your kind of client side

3204
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:07,620
or do we have those here on ours?

3205
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:08,020
I wonder.

3206
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:10,180
I believe it's just on mine because I'm hosting.

3207
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:10,420
Yeah.

3208
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:11,860
So we can just remake it but...

3209
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:13,569
Okay.

3210
02:25:13,569 --> 02:25:16,610
Yeah, we can just wait for a steam maintenance, I guess.

3211
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:18,930
Is that actually what happened or can people confirm that

3212
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:21,520
or are people just being goofy?

3213
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:22,479
I'm online.

3214
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:25,760
I don't know if you're offline on Steam or if you live time.

3215
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,690
I know.

3216
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:31,180
Somebody said, I got it too.

3217
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:31,500
It's real.

3218
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:32,059
I got it.

3219
02:25:32,059 --> 02:25:32,620
Okay.

3220
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:35,469
Let's see.

3221
02:25:35,469 --> 02:25:36,350
Friends.

3222
02:25:36,350 --> 02:25:38,459
Yeah, it says I'm disconnected.

3223
02:25:38,459 --> 02:25:39,420
Let me try to get back in.

3224
02:25:41,549 --> 02:25:47,569
I'm going to add you to friends anyway.

3225
02:25:47,569 --> 02:25:48,129
Steam.

3226
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:50,290
Oh, okay.

3227
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:51,489
I can't even add you as a friend.

3228
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:56,860
Good old Steam Maintenance Tuesday.

3229
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:58,940
Oh, yeah.

3230
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:02,219
The thing is like this has been happening consistently on a Tuesday for like 10 years

3231
02:26:02,219 --> 02:26:04,620
and every week I forget it exists until it happens.

3232
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:06,500
Seriously, same thing.

3233
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,420
I think I actually had a meltdown on stream one time

3234
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:10,979
where I said I would never be live ever again

3235
02:26:10,979 --> 02:26:15,469
between like 12 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday ever again.

3236
02:26:15,469 --> 02:26:17,700
I think I say that every single Tuesday this happens.

3237
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:19,299
Next week you were live between 12 and...

3238
02:26:20,899 --> 02:26:21,860
This is what I'm saying.

3239
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:23,739
Like it's time to go to the...

3240
02:26:23,739 --> 02:26:27,250
Let's all go to the Epic Games Store.

3241
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:28,129
Gamers rise up.

3242
02:26:31,389 --> 02:26:32,110
I'm going to go pee.

3243
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:32,829
I'll be back.

3244
02:26:32,829 --> 02:26:33,389
Okay.

3245
02:26:33,389 --> 02:26:35,489
Hopefully it comes right back and doesn't...

3246
02:26:35,489 --> 02:26:38,340
Because sometimes it takes like 30 plus minutes.

3247
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:39,219
Wait, really?

3248
02:26:39,219 --> 02:26:40,340
This happened before, yeah.

3249
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:41,629
We'll find out.

3250
02:26:41,629 --> 02:26:42,350
I'll be right back.

3251
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:45,420
Hold on.

3252
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:47,579
Ashley called me two hours ago?

3253
02:26:47,579 --> 02:26:54,110
Okay.

3254
02:26:54,110 --> 02:26:54,670
Weird.

3255
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:57,340
I'll be right back.

3256
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:58,420
Okay.

3257
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:13,389
So how long is Dr. Ted down for?

3258
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:14,829
When does it come out?

3259
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:19,629
I thought it would have come out in like an hour.

3260
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:24,879
Back to the little stream.

3261
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:30,219
10 a.m. PST tomorrow.

3262
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:35,520
That's my stream start time.

3263
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:59,200
The second Mario movie trailer was fun.

3264
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:04,219
Does Mario still sound like Linda from Bob's Burgers?

3265
02:28:09,069 --> 02:28:12,159
Oh, yes.

3266
02:28:12,719 --> 02:28:56,459
I have such a luscious beard.

3267
02:28:56,459 --> 02:28:56,940
Thank you.

3268
02:28:59,489 --> 02:29:01,329
You have such a luscious beard.

3269
02:29:01,889 --> 02:29:03,809
Are you guys enjoying the stream?

3270
02:29:03,809 --> 02:29:04,610
Why'd you ignore me?

3271
02:29:05,649 --> 02:29:06,209
Thanks, man.

3272
02:29:06,930 --> 02:29:16,239
I feel like we're having a really great adventure.

3273
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,620
I feel like...

3274
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:24,239
Chad did a prediction on who was going to be the third whale

3275
02:29:24,239 --> 02:29:26,319
and it has 100% ended up being me.

3276
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:27,920
It was inevitable.

3277
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:29,360
You guys literally got married.

3278
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:32,079
We really got like one romance option

3279
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:33,440
and I was like, okay, let's get married.

3280
02:29:34,159 --> 02:29:38,079
Like four years ago, I was a little bit saucy

3281
02:29:38,079 --> 02:29:40,159
and it just from there was obvious.

3282
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,760
Yeah, you're a little bit handsy like five years ago.

3283
02:29:45,299 --> 02:29:47,540
I just like complimented him like one time.

3284
02:29:48,659 --> 02:29:49,860
I think I don't even remember.

3285
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:53,709
Yeah, it was getting super fun.

3286
02:29:53,709 --> 02:29:54,829
I slept on.

3287
02:29:54,829 --> 02:30:11,010
Remember when you stripped for charity on the Oaks Coast a decade ago?

3288
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:11,409
I do.

3289
02:30:12,690 --> 02:30:13,569
I do.

3290
02:30:13,569 --> 02:30:18,379
I don't.

3291
02:30:18,379 --> 02:30:19,739
I don't have that memory.

3292
02:30:19,739 --> 02:30:20,299
Yes, you do.

3293
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:22,459
I did not know about that,

3294
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:25,340
but I'm going to be Googling that intensively tonight.

3295
02:30:27,069 --> 02:30:28,030
Tonight?

3296
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:28,270
Yes.

3297
02:30:31,069 --> 02:30:35,280
You would be cheating on Thomas.

3298
02:30:36,459 --> 02:30:37,260
He doesn't care.

3299
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:40,559
Are you sure?

3300
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:42,159
Have you asked him?

3301
02:30:42,879 --> 02:30:44,639
When he comes back, we can ask him

3302
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:48,100
how seriously he's taking our relationship.

3303
02:30:48,100 --> 02:30:52,420
How do you guys make out?

3304
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:52,979
You're a wolf.

3305
02:30:55,819 --> 02:30:58,540
You know, you don't have to kiss to show affection

3306
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:00,219
and I've got one human arm.

3307
02:31:00,219 --> 02:31:01,420
I just use that.

3308
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:02,620
You guys like Eskimo kiss?

3309
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:04,139
Like touch noses?

3310
02:31:05,659 --> 02:31:09,299
No, I sniff his behind.

3311
02:31:09,299 --> 02:31:15,540
Oh, oh.

3312
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:16,579
Just keep it real.

3313
02:31:16,579 --> 02:31:18,899
You know, just keep it 100.

3314
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,360
Yeah.

3315
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:23,979
Staying true to me.

3316
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:27,600
Is it back?

3317
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:33,819
Looks like Steam is back.

3318
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:35,040
Okay.

3319
02:31:38,579 --> 02:31:39,299
Nuzzles you.

3320
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:40,950
Wait.

3321
02:31:41,569 --> 02:31:42,850
Yeah, nuzzles you.

3322
02:31:42,850 --> 02:31:44,110
It looks like it's back.

3323
02:31:44,110 --> 02:31:47,540
What?

3324
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:48,040
What are you doing?

3325
02:31:48,979 --> 02:31:49,860
I'm nuzzling you.

3326
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:50,739
He's nuzzling you.

3327
02:31:50,739 --> 02:31:53,620
Oh, I didn't know who you were talking to.

3328
02:31:54,579 --> 02:31:55,700
Oh, we're married, dude.

3329
02:31:59,170 --> 02:32:00,850
I don't even know.

3330
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:01,489
All right.

3331
02:32:01,489 --> 02:32:05,809
Okay.

3332
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:11,780
This is what married couples do.

3333
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:14,100
So should we just try and remake, I guess?

3334
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:14,659
I guess.

3335
02:32:14,659 --> 02:32:15,540
It looks like we're back, right?

3336
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:17,149
Yeah.

3337
02:32:17,149 --> 02:32:19,469
It won't let me save and quit though

3338
02:32:19,469 --> 02:32:22,620
because we're like stuck in a story thing.

3339
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:25,899
Should we just try to join off you again?

3340
02:32:25,899 --> 02:32:27,899
Yeah. Did you add me?

3341
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:29,600
Let's see.

3342
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:35,020
You might on Steam.

3343
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:38,059
That is a great question considering I, dude,

3344
02:32:38,059 --> 02:32:40,139
I don't know how to even do that anymore.

3345
02:32:40,139 --> 02:32:41,270
Oh, okay.

3346
02:32:42,209 --> 02:32:47,489
If you open your friends list in the top right,

3347
02:32:47,489 --> 02:32:49,809
it says like add friends like a little man with a plus sign.

3348
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:53,780
And then you just pop my friend code in there.

3349
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:54,659
Oh, cool.

3350
02:32:54,659 --> 02:32:57,379
I haven't done this in a long time.

3351
02:32:57,379 --> 02:33:00,530
Okay.

3352
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:01,329
That's you.

3353
02:33:01,329 --> 02:33:06,299
Send invite.

3354
02:33:06,299 --> 02:33:07,020
Show auto?

3355
02:33:08,979 --> 02:33:10,340
No, I'm not going to show auto.

3356
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:10,979
Hang it out down.

3357
02:33:14,979 --> 02:33:16,319
Okay.

3358
02:33:16,319 --> 02:33:18,319
And then invite to lobby.

3359
02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:19,780
Let's see if this works.

3360
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:20,819
He's down that way.

3361
02:33:20,819 --> 02:33:22,930
He's down there.

3362
02:33:22,930 --> 02:33:23,569
I'm not going to go.

3363
02:33:23,569 --> 02:33:25,139
Invite works.

3364
02:33:25,139 --> 02:33:26,459
Show auto.

3365
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:28,940
No, I don't want to go get auto.

3366
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:29,739
He's probably comfortable.

3367
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,879
Did you say you tried to invite me?

3368
02:33:34,879 --> 02:33:41,389
Yeah, I'm in there.

3369
02:33:41,389 --> 02:33:47,329
I don't see an invite.

3370
02:33:47,329 --> 02:33:47,969
You don't?

3371
02:33:47,969 --> 02:33:48,850
I do not.

3372
02:33:48,850 --> 02:33:52,420
You mean like on like the Steam kind of like boom,

3373
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:53,459
you got invited to something?

3374
02:33:53,459 --> 02:33:54,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3375
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:58,620
No, I'm ice cream sandwich, by the way, just in case.

3376
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:01,819
I sent you an invite to lobby.

3377
02:34:01,819 --> 02:34:06,049
Can you join game with me?

3378
02:34:06,049 --> 02:34:07,329
That's what I'm trying to do here.

3379
02:34:07,329 --> 02:34:07,889
Yeah, let's see.

3380
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:10,129
Let's say join game.

3381
02:34:17,299 --> 02:34:17,940
Let's get started.

3382
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:19,540
I think we can just auto forward.

3383
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:21,459
Yeah, I'm just going to restart the game.

3384
02:34:21,459 --> 02:34:24,579
I think that maybe when it was the Steam maintenance happened,

3385
02:34:24,579 --> 02:34:27,860
it maybe has to be rebooted or something.

3386
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:30,700
Thank you, Gaben.

3387
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:31,180
You know what?

3388
02:34:33,229 --> 02:34:34,190
It's what?

3389
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:40,899
Three o'clock in the afternoon Pacific,

3390
02:34:40,899 --> 02:34:42,020
like right in the middle of the day.

3391
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:42,579
Time.

3392
02:34:42,579 --> 02:34:44,260
Let's say it's an inconsiderate time.

3393
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:45,059
That's what it is.

3394
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:45,780
How dare they?

3395
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:46,340
I'm just kidding.

3396
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:49,340
All right.

3397
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:50,139
I'm back in.

3398
02:34:50,139 --> 02:34:52,219
Let's see if I can join you.

3399
02:34:52,219 --> 02:34:52,620
Okay.

3400
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:53,420
I'm actually going to.

3401
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:57,809
All right.

3402
02:34:57,809 --> 02:35:00,129
I am trying to join you right now.

3403
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:07,680
I'm remaking the game.

3404
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:10,079
Otto's comfy gaming in his gaming room.

3405
02:35:10,079 --> 02:35:10,819
Okay.

3406
02:35:10,819 --> 02:35:11,379
You should be.

3407
02:35:11,379 --> 02:35:12,340
You should be able to join me.

3408
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:15,180
I made a friend's lobby and then I'll load the.

3409
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:15,899
Hey, I can see it.

3410
02:35:15,899 --> 02:35:16,770
Yep.

3411
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:19,659
There it is.

3412
02:35:19,659 --> 02:35:20,059
All right.

3413
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:23,069
Hey, there we go.

3414
02:35:23,069 --> 02:35:24,059
I'm in.

3415
02:35:24,059 --> 02:35:27,139
Yeah, you're in this.

3416
02:35:27,139 --> 02:35:28,350
I'm in.

3417
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:28,750
I'm in.

3418
02:35:29,469 --> 02:35:30,110
Okay.

3419
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:30,670
He's not.

3420
02:35:30,670 --> 02:35:32,750
I can't see the current panel, though.

3421
02:35:32,750 --> 02:35:33,870
It's like blank.

3422
02:35:33,870 --> 02:35:34,829
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3423
02:35:34,829 --> 02:35:36,700
We made the lobby.

3424
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:38,059
Oh, what the hell am I in?

3425
02:35:39,899 --> 02:35:40,459
I don't know.

3426
02:35:40,459 --> 02:35:41,180
I don't know.

3427
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:42,219
You know, I don't want to know.

3428
02:35:42,219 --> 02:35:45,739
Yeah, sir.

3429
02:35:45,739 --> 02:35:51,579
I had to restart my whole game for it to show up if you didn't do that yet.

3430
02:35:51,579 --> 02:36:00,510
Uh, can you like settle down?

3431
02:36:00,510 --> 02:36:00,989
Yep.

3432
02:36:00,989 --> 02:36:03,040
I'm good.

3433
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:03,440
Hold on.

3434
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:05,760
I'm going to restart my game.

3435
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,280
You might be on to something.

3436
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:08,959
Wait, are you restarting or are you good?

3437
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:09,920
I'm restarting.

3438
02:36:24,930 --> 02:36:27,569
Man, that's as beautiful as the song we sung together.

3439
02:36:27,569 --> 02:36:29,090
I wonder how that actually turned out.

3440
02:36:29,090 --> 02:36:34,860
All right.

3441
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:39,889
I wonder, were we even matching the same tempo?

3442
02:36:39,889 --> 02:36:45,790
I who could.

3443
02:36:45,790 --> 02:36:46,510
All right.

3444
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:48,430
Let's get back in here.

3445
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:49,389
Can you see it?

3446
02:36:49,389 --> 02:36:49,950
I hope so.

3447
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:54,430
I see like a blue screen with leaves.

3448
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:55,149
Mine's blue.

3449
02:36:55,709 --> 02:36:56,430
Gray.

3450
02:36:56,430 --> 02:36:58,030
All right.

3451
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:59,389
New threats.

3452
02:36:59,389 --> 02:37:05,329
All right.

3453
02:37:05,329 --> 02:37:05,889
Oh, yeah.

3454
02:37:05,889 --> 02:37:10,610
We missed the whole thing then because the last one was talking about like trying to figure out

3455
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:12,129
what the crystal meant.

3456
02:37:12,129 --> 02:37:15,250
I feel like that might be a way to go back and watch it.

3457
02:37:15,250 --> 02:37:21,059
It's possible it just got kind of sniped from the steam going down.

3458
02:37:21,059 --> 02:37:21,700
That's all right, though.

3459
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,659
We can just fill in the blanks.

3460
02:37:22,659 --> 02:37:24,290
Wow.

3461
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:25,809
What does this thing do?

3462
02:37:25,809 --> 02:37:26,690
Well, we know you guys.

3463
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:28,370
We know you guys got married.

3464
02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:32,129
We know that I was just a loner for a long time.

3465
02:37:32,129 --> 02:37:36,690
So look at that.

3466
02:37:36,690 --> 02:37:40,850
We have to go investigate Lambstream Altar.

3467
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:41,569
Yes.

3468
02:37:41,569 --> 02:37:43,569
How do we reliably get there?

3469
02:37:43,569 --> 02:37:46,530
We're down from sleeping top?

3470
02:37:48,450 --> 02:37:48,690
Yeah.

3471
02:37:48,690 --> 02:37:51,540
We're back in thunder roast now.

3472
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:52,500
This seems treacherous.

3473
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:54,860
I feel like this is a treacherous way to go.

3474
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:55,100
Yeah.

3475
02:37:55,100 --> 02:37:58,379
I think we go into the Dachia Forest, right?

3476
02:37:58,379 --> 02:37:59,739
That's our next play.

3477
02:37:59,739 --> 02:38:00,700
I think that's the play.

3478
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:01,979
Okay.

3479
02:38:01,979 --> 02:38:03,899
We all aged 10 years.

3480
02:38:03,979 --> 02:38:05,739
So now I'm 39.

3481
02:38:05,739 --> 02:38:07,180
I've got gray in my hair.

3482
02:38:08,059 --> 02:38:08,459
What does it say?

3483
02:38:08,459 --> 02:38:09,180
What does it show your age?

3484
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:10,979
No, no.

3485
02:38:10,979 --> 02:38:11,139
Yeah.

3486
02:38:11,139 --> 02:38:12,739
If you hover over yourself, it'll tell your age.

3487
02:38:12,739 --> 02:38:13,219
It's weird.

3488
02:38:13,219 --> 02:38:15,540
If you look at my portrait, I've got gray in my hair.

3489
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:15,860
Hang on.

3490
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:18,340
I've got side quests.

3491
02:38:18,340 --> 02:38:19,139
I'm the youngest.

3492
02:38:21,139 --> 02:38:22,340
Not one for festivals.

3493
02:38:28,110 --> 02:38:28,989
What's the point?

3494
02:38:29,729 --> 02:38:32,530
No one's having conversations.

3495
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:33,329
Just songs.

3496
02:38:33,329 --> 02:38:35,170
And I don't like songs now.

3497
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:35,329
Yeah.

3498
02:38:35,329 --> 02:38:36,450
I thought you loved songs.

3499
02:38:37,170 --> 02:38:39,010
I am over songs.

3500
02:38:39,010 --> 02:38:43,170
Once I went on a two-year trip to sing one.

3501
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:43,489
Yeah.

3502
02:38:43,489 --> 02:38:44,770
I actually feel the same.

3503
02:38:44,770 --> 02:38:48,059
I love how the panel just completed your other arm.

3504
02:38:48,059 --> 02:38:55,520
But I'm trying to do my community spirit.

3505
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:56,319
Right.

3506
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:56,959
Yeah.

3507
02:38:56,959 --> 02:38:59,360
I've gained my chance then.

3508
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:03,170
Might be stimulating.

3509
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:03,569
Later.

3510
02:39:06,209 --> 02:39:10,020
That was damn right uncanny.

3511
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:11,219
It was lucky.

3512
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:16,670
Honestly though, do you have a secret?

3513
02:39:17,469 --> 02:39:21,420
I've never seen someone roll that well.

3514
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:22,379
No secret.

3515
02:39:22,379 --> 02:39:23,979
I'll get on these streaks sometimes.

3516
02:39:23,979 --> 02:39:25,579
Cars, dice, coins.

3517
02:39:25,579 --> 02:39:28,819
But now that you mention it, I've always wondered what would

3518
02:39:28,819 --> 02:39:32,510
happen if we were just to pick a direction.

3519
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:33,469
A direction?

3520
02:39:35,250 --> 02:39:36,850
Just pick a direction and go.

3521
02:39:36,850 --> 02:39:40,129
If I'm really on a hot streak, well, I bet we'll find a magic item.

3522
02:39:40,850 --> 02:39:42,290
Magic item?

3523
02:39:42,290 --> 02:39:43,170
Seriously?

3524
02:39:43,170 --> 02:39:44,370
You really are Scooby-Doo.

3525
02:39:51,219 --> 02:39:51,700
Write him.

3526
02:39:52,899 --> 02:39:54,000
Write him.

3527
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:54,239
Okay.

3528
02:39:54,799 --> 02:39:57,010
We're all going.

3529
02:39:57,010 --> 02:39:58,129
We're all going.

3530
02:39:58,129 --> 02:39:58,610
Let's go.

3531
02:39:58,610 --> 02:40:00,780
We're just going to pick a direction.

3532
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:04,350
Apparently.

3533
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:06,590
My trip took us like three days.

3534
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:08,700
I see the edge of the forest.

3535
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:14,219
Oh, I saw this forest as an edge.

3536
02:40:14,219 --> 02:40:17,889
That's nice.

3537
02:40:17,889 --> 02:40:19,409
What the hell was that?

3538
02:40:19,409 --> 02:40:21,790
Everything has an edge.

3539
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:23,629
Including my patients.

3540
02:40:23,629 --> 02:40:26,639
It's like Yoda too.

3541
02:40:26,639 --> 02:40:30,319
Look, it was a joke in the first place, wasn't it?

3542
02:40:30,879 --> 02:40:32,959
Keep walking until we find a what.

3543
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:34,559
Why would someone do that?

3544
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:39,149
Just walk around and wander for no reason.

3545
02:40:39,149 --> 02:40:42,000
Nice to take a little trip with a trip.

3546
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:44,399
Well, hang on a minute.

3547
02:40:44,399 --> 02:40:46,399
I've walked for two years for you.

3548
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:49,280
You have no legs to stand on here.

3549
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:50,479
I'm not seeing the point of this trip.

3550
02:40:50,479 --> 02:40:51,760
I don't understand.

3551
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:54,239
Well, at least check out that castle first.

3552
02:40:56,209 --> 02:40:57,629
That's so funny.

3553
02:40:57,629 --> 02:40:57,950
Look.

3554
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:58,829
Why are you huge?

3555
02:40:58,829 --> 02:40:59,309
I'm huge.

3556
02:40:59,309 --> 02:41:00,030
I'm giant.

3557
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:05,389
Where there's presumably a magic item.

3558
02:41:07,329 --> 02:41:09,120
Follow me, Alungus.

3559
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,239
Yeah, I'm getting bigger.

3560
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:12,879
You look pissed.

3561
02:41:12,879 --> 02:41:14,959
You do not want to be here right now.

3562
02:41:14,959 --> 02:41:17,120
All right, Gemma, what are we doing?

3563
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:20,159
Are we going in the front or are we climbing a window or a ledge?

3564
02:41:20,879 --> 02:41:21,760
Make Alungus climb.

3565
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:26,700
I think that's funnier.

3566
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,120
They climb through a crumbling window.

3567
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:31,600
You certainly like to make things hard.

3568
02:41:35,469 --> 02:41:37,149
Oh, you're behind my arm.

3569
02:41:39,899 --> 02:41:41,420
I'm thorough.

3570
02:41:41,420 --> 02:41:45,180
Always start at the top of a problem and work your way down.

3571
02:41:46,219 --> 02:41:50,239
Goes for castles too.

3572
02:41:50,239 --> 02:41:51,120
Well, fine.

3573
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:52,719
That makes some sense, I guess.

3574
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:57,549
I'll have to tell the age.

3575
02:41:57,549 --> 02:42:00,670
These double beams are a hallmark of even way to build her.

3576
02:42:00,670 --> 02:42:02,030
She's 200 years dead.

3577
02:42:02,670 --> 02:42:04,989
Your neck seems a little stiff.

3578
02:42:05,709 --> 02:42:06,430
So does yours.

3579
02:42:07,870 --> 02:42:12,850
There's a pretty big gap you can see to the lower level.

3580
02:42:12,850 --> 02:42:15,329
Well, this stuff's more recent.

3581
02:42:15,329 --> 02:42:17,149
What stuff?

3582
02:42:18,750 --> 02:42:19,979
Stop.

3583
02:42:19,979 --> 02:42:21,549
Stop that.

3584
02:42:21,549 --> 02:42:25,569
Little trove collected from who knows where.

3585
02:42:25,569 --> 02:42:26,930
Does it look magical?

3586
02:42:26,930 --> 02:42:29,629
Not even a tiny bit.

3587
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:33,389
That's the first time I've been happy.

3588
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:35,229
You probably found a bone.

3589
02:42:35,870 --> 02:42:40,899
Tell you what though, it does look guarded.

3590
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:44,739
Took you that long to see that thing in the room with you guys?

3591
02:42:44,739 --> 02:42:45,940
Yeah, it was there the whole time.

3592
02:42:45,940 --> 02:42:47,139
It was there the entire time.

3593
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,579
The butler.

3594
02:42:48,579 --> 02:42:49,459
Look at this thing.

3595
02:42:49,459 --> 02:42:52,829
Oh my God.

3596
02:42:52,829 --> 02:42:56,579
All right, what do we got?

3597
02:42:56,579 --> 02:42:57,229
Oh my God.

3598
02:42:57,229 --> 02:42:59,389
Look at Thomas, how much magic armour he has.

3599
02:42:59,389 --> 02:43:01,149
I know, I'm unstoppable.

3600
02:43:03,059 --> 02:43:04,020
Actually, I'm going to move again.

3601
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:04,819
I want to get closer.

3602
02:43:05,459 --> 02:43:10,319
This thing's got a lot of health, by the way.

3603
02:43:10,399 --> 02:43:19,229
Pop them.

3604
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:20,430
Nice.

3605
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:25,409
Thomas, if you take damage, I'll get upset.

3606
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:26,610
All right.

3607
02:43:26,610 --> 02:43:27,889
Well, that was a barrel mode.

3608
02:43:29,329 --> 02:43:30,049
11 damage.

3609
02:43:30,049 --> 02:43:30,530
Holy shit.

3610
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:42,819
It's remarkable to find one alone like this.

3611
02:43:42,819 --> 02:43:46,100
Up here would be curious what directed its decision.

3612
02:43:46,739 --> 02:43:49,379
If decision is even the right word.

3613
02:43:49,379 --> 02:43:51,139
Well, let's not razz more of them, eh?

3614
02:43:52,979 --> 02:43:57,440
We can grab some of these materials.

3615
02:43:58,239 --> 02:43:58,639
Right.

3616
02:43:58,639 --> 02:43:59,520
That's what I mean.

3617
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:00,959
And then back where we came.

3618
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:05,200
A short while later.

3619
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:09,709
So looks like I won the bet.

3620
02:44:11,579 --> 02:44:12,700
Seems you did.

3621
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:13,500
You guys were betting?

3622
02:44:14,379 --> 02:44:16,319
What do I owe you now?

3623
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:16,819
Socks?

3624
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:18,639
No socks.

3625
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,920
What you failed to mention is a size.

3626
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:31,040
My neck!

3627
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:35,819
On the journey back, my neck breaks.

3628
02:44:35,819 --> 02:44:39,260
There's a tea house not far.

3629
02:44:41,180 --> 02:44:43,979
Uh, hold on, but socks?

3630
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:46,860
There are different socks sizes?

3631
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:48,379
I thought it was just like a pair of socks.

3632
02:44:48,379 --> 02:44:49,579
It's like universal, isn't it?

3633
02:44:49,579 --> 02:44:52,540
Like size, like five through like 14 or something?

3634
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:57,500
How would a size 14 foot fit in a size five sock?

3635
02:44:57,500 --> 02:44:58,219
I don't know.

3636
02:44:58,219 --> 02:44:59,659
Aren't socks like just one size?

3637
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:01,899
No, it's the way like they're like brackets.

3638
02:45:01,899 --> 02:45:05,739
So like a size will be like 10 to 13.

3639
02:45:05,739 --> 02:45:09,340
And then like really nine to five and then like four to one.

3640
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:09,659
Yeah.

3641
02:45:09,659 --> 02:45:12,459
Is that why sometimes I get fucking fucked up socks that just don't fit?

3642
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:13,680
Yeah.

3643
02:45:14,059 --> 02:45:17,969
I thought it was just like medium, like medium or big.

3644
02:45:17,969 --> 02:45:19,170
I didn't know they had whatever.

3645
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:21,729
I'm not kidding.

3646
02:45:21,729 --> 02:45:22,690
I swear to God.

3647
02:45:22,690 --> 02:45:23,649
This makes perfect sense.

3648
02:45:23,649 --> 02:45:25,729
I share socks with my four-year-old daughter.

3649
02:45:25,729 --> 02:45:26,049
Yeah.

3650
02:45:26,049 --> 02:45:27,010
No, I just, I, I.

3651
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:28,049
My size 13 feet.

3652
02:45:30,049 --> 02:45:31,010
Dude, I have a pair.

3653
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:33,649
I have socks and I was trying to figure out why the fuck this happened.

3654
02:45:33,649 --> 02:45:34,049
I'm not kidding.

3655
02:45:34,049 --> 02:45:35,250
This is a real story.

3656
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:40,610
Every single pair of socks that I own has a huge hole in both feet at the bottom.

3657
02:45:40,610 --> 02:45:42,739
And it's in the same exact spot.

3658
02:45:42,739 --> 02:45:45,139
And it's definitely because I bought like socks that were way too small.

3659
02:45:45,139 --> 02:45:47,180
That's ridiculous.

3660
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:47,739
I can't believe it.

3661
02:45:47,739 --> 02:45:48,059
Yeah.

3662
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:48,299
Yeah.

3663
02:45:48,299 --> 02:45:50,860
You might have to buy new socks, but you didn't win the bet.

3664
02:45:50,860 --> 02:45:56,500
So I thought, man, and you missed black Friday.

3665
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:02,180
They don't make it in time, but are soaked in the storm.

3666
02:46:02,819 --> 02:46:04,260
But the tea house is dry.

3667
02:46:04,819 --> 02:46:11,579
The fragrant teas and later the mugs of mold whiskey are hot.

3668
02:46:11,579 --> 02:46:13,100
Hot whiskey is the thing.

3669
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:13,579
Yeah.

3670
02:46:13,579 --> 02:46:14,459
Hot whiskey is amazing.

3671
02:46:14,459 --> 02:46:15,500
You never had it?

3672
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:16,799
You've had, you've ever had hot whiskey?

3673
02:46:16,799 --> 02:46:17,440
Had some honey.

3674
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:20,639
Do you actually, have you had it a lot before?

3675
02:46:20,639 --> 02:46:21,360
I haven't had it before.

3676
02:46:23,010 --> 02:46:24,530
I'm not speaking to you.

3677
02:46:24,530 --> 02:46:28,799
No, there's one more round.

3678
02:46:28,799 --> 02:46:31,360
It's something I have whenever I'm like, I catch a cold or something.

3679
02:46:32,719 --> 02:46:36,239
I mean, America has hot toddies, but I think they're a bit different in America.

3680
02:46:36,239 --> 02:46:40,000
But hot toddies and I don't think, I don't think in America when we get sick,

3681
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,440
I don't think we drink alcohol.

3682
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:44,639
Hot toddies like England Island is like whiskey with honey.

3683
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,719
And that's like it.

3684
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:47,280
And some lemon.

3685
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:47,600
Really?

3686
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:48,719
Yeah.

3687
02:46:48,719 --> 02:46:49,600
And it's really good.

3688
02:46:50,079 --> 02:46:51,280
That sounds pretty good.

3689
02:46:53,010 --> 02:46:53,729
Hot whiskey.

3690
02:46:54,670 --> 02:46:54,829
Yeah.

3691
02:46:54,829 --> 02:46:55,389
I've never had it.

3692
02:46:55,389 --> 02:46:56,829
I'm curious if you had it.

3693
02:46:56,829 --> 02:46:57,309
That's cool.

3694
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:01,700
Thinking about something.

3695
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:03,809
Just rain.

3696
02:47:07,809 --> 02:47:11,569
Rain and all these nine mystical phenomena that paint our lives.

3697
02:47:11,569 --> 02:47:15,649
That we try to explain into mundanity so we can take them for granted.

3698
02:47:15,649 --> 02:47:17,090
You don't know what rain is.

3699
02:47:19,809 --> 02:47:20,610
What's rain?

3700
02:47:22,129 --> 02:47:23,969
Rain, but also all this stuff.

3701
02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:28,420
I don't know.

3702
02:47:28,420 --> 02:47:30,180
Think back to our journey's beginning.

3703
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:34,819
Fortune is the spur of the moment that strikes restless hearts and sparks an adventure.

3704
02:47:35,379 --> 02:47:37,299
Luck is the people you share it with.

3705
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:40,989
If I didn't know the crap.

3706
02:47:42,799 --> 02:47:44,319
I'm not as drunk as you yet.

3707
02:47:47,229 --> 02:47:48,750
Just one more.

3708
02:47:49,469 --> 02:47:51,260
All right.

3709
02:47:52,139 --> 02:47:53,180
I thought that was a sandwich.

3710
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:56,739
You feel like you're getting hungry?

3711
02:47:57,379 --> 02:47:58,579
Oh, you leveled up.

3712
02:47:58,579 --> 02:47:59,299
Nice.

3713
02:47:59,299 --> 02:48:00,500
Plus 10 more time and age.

3714
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:01,219
Okay.

3715
02:48:01,219 --> 02:48:05,420
And then gets two extra armor.

3716
02:48:07,329 --> 02:48:09,090
And I might just take two extra armor.

3717
02:48:09,819 --> 02:48:12,860
Every other turn as a swift action and then sheds two of a foe's armor.

3718
02:48:12,860 --> 02:48:13,579
Now, let's do it.

3719
02:48:13,579 --> 02:48:14,860
I want to be tankier.

3720
02:48:14,860 --> 02:48:15,420
Let's do that.

3721
02:48:20,209 --> 02:48:20,370
Okay.

3722
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:22,290
They're shifting over to the Mortha.

3723
02:48:23,329 --> 02:48:23,729
How is it?

3724
02:48:23,729 --> 02:48:24,770
Morthagy?

3725
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:25,809
Morthaguy?

3726
02:48:25,809 --> 02:48:27,469
What are you?

3727
02:48:27,469 --> 02:48:28,190
What's going on, man?

3728
02:48:29,969 --> 02:48:31,329
Is he having a seizure?

3729
02:48:31,329 --> 02:48:32,129
No.

3730
02:48:32,129 --> 02:48:35,090
The name of the groups, like the Gorgons.

3731
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:36,739
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3732
02:48:36,739 --> 02:48:37,459
I see what you're saying.

3733
02:48:37,459 --> 02:48:37,700
All right.

3734
02:48:37,700 --> 02:48:41,700
So you can see in Brandland as a recruit opportunity.

3735
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:46,500
So if we had someone die or your character like had lost both his arms,

3736
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:50,100
we could replace someone in our party and like recruit someone new.

3737
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:52,899
If we recruit someone new, we would actually be the Fabulous Four.

3738
02:48:53,620 --> 02:48:54,020
We would.

3739
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:55,860
But then it wouldn't be funny anymore.

3740
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:56,579
I don't like that.

3741
02:48:57,219 --> 02:48:57,540
Yeah.

3742
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:00,420
I think we should just like go past it and scout.

3743
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,940
We're going to Dachia Forest.

3744
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:04,479
Sounds good.

3745
02:49:08,799 --> 02:49:09,280
Dismiss.

3746
02:49:10,079 --> 02:49:11,280
Three more days remaining.

3747
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:13,819
Oh, till the end.

3748
02:49:13,819 --> 02:49:14,459
Oh, no.

3749
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:14,780
Great.

3750
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:15,739
Okay.

3751
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:17,520
Let's go.

3752
02:49:18,239 --> 02:49:22,829
What if we just wandered around for a bit?

3753
02:49:23,780 --> 02:49:25,139
Oh, event.

3754
02:49:26,670 --> 02:49:32,239
Oh, I have lost eyes, throwing them irretrievable upon the sea.

3755
02:49:32,239 --> 02:49:35,440
I have drowned my voice in those wailing waters.

3756
02:49:36,159 --> 02:49:37,840
Ochre at sunset.

3757
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,040
The waves distance has washed my memories away.

3758
02:49:42,239 --> 02:49:47,700
I have seen the end, watched it come and watched it pass many times.

3759
02:49:48,340 --> 02:49:50,180
I know something of what lies ahead.

3760
02:49:50,899 --> 02:49:56,819
Along us and Thomas wait for Inon to come up the road,

3761
02:49:56,819 --> 02:49:58,899
taking shelter in an abandoned place.

3762
02:49:58,899 --> 02:50:01,459
They've chanced on another traveler.

3763
02:50:03,219 --> 02:50:06,299
That's a tantalizing crumb.

3764
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:09,420
I don't want to do every single thing.

3765
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:12,059
I was waiting.

3766
02:50:12,059 --> 02:50:13,260
I'm going to be the spooky lady.

3767
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:15,819
I was hoping you were going to do all of them.

3768
02:50:15,819 --> 02:50:16,319
All right.

3769
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:20,450
To someone who little knows the weight of knowledge, I am sure it appeals.

3770
02:50:23,790 --> 02:50:28,860
You must realize the only-

3771
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:30,459
What has a star ever told me

3772
02:50:30,459 --> 02:50:31,819
that made me want less to know it?

3773
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:35,500
Rain chatters on the thatch.

3774
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:39,420
I see things written in the turning of storms,

3775
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:42,219
in silver-wet letters and shaking pages of rain.

3776
02:50:42,219 --> 02:50:44,940
I read of dreams left behind this yondering.

3777
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:47,520
I read of dooms the year is intent.

3778
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:51,139
I read until my eyes shine and my stomach roars.

3779
02:50:51,139 --> 02:50:54,860
I have read of you.

3780
02:50:55,420 --> 02:50:58,590
I know what you are meant to be.

3781
02:50:58,590 --> 02:50:59,229
A dog.

3782
02:50:59,229 --> 02:51:00,829
You meant to be a full dog.

3783
02:51:04,209 --> 02:51:06,209
Not sure I believe in faute.

3784
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:09,139
No one demands you believe.

3785
02:51:09,139 --> 02:51:14,829
You only must endure what happens.

3786
02:51:14,829 --> 02:51:17,709
The old storage building smells like ancient hay,

3787
02:51:18,430 --> 02:51:19,389
moist rock,

3788
02:51:19,389 --> 02:51:22,350
and the burning pine pitch of their torch.

3789
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:27,229
The woman's robe moves like it's part of her.

3790
02:51:27,229 --> 02:51:28,350
She shrugs.

3791
02:51:29,229 --> 02:51:32,129
It's going to be really hard for me to continue

3792
02:51:32,129 --> 02:51:33,409
because I just looked over at my chat

3793
02:51:33,409 --> 02:51:35,170
and I just see Stewie being spammed

3794
02:51:35,170 --> 02:51:37,409
and it's like ruining everything.

3795
02:51:37,409 --> 02:51:39,649
Put the fingers together right now.

3796
02:51:40,450 --> 02:51:40,950
Fortunes.

3797
02:51:43,459 --> 02:51:44,979
I think you're doing a really good voice here.

3798
02:51:44,979 --> 02:51:46,899
Fortunes were given to crows to tell,

3799
02:51:46,899 --> 02:51:49,299
and crows were kind enough to share their gift with witches.

3800
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:51,860
A witch, well paid,

3801
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:54,100
shares fortunes with the way blind, Brian.

3802
02:51:54,100 --> 02:52:04,370
I'll give you my blood.

3803
02:52:04,370 --> 02:52:06,690
Wait, another transformation?

3804
02:52:06,690 --> 02:52:07,969
Another transformation.

3805
02:52:07,969 --> 02:52:08,469
For you?

3806
02:52:09,180 --> 02:52:10,219
Yeah, do it, man.

3807
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:12,290
What are you going to turn into?

3808
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:16,610
Then you have already glimpsed the form

3809
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:18,690
your roving spirit must take.

3810
02:52:18,690 --> 02:52:20,290
You have seen it in your sleep

3811
02:52:20,290 --> 02:52:22,690
and it will not shatter you.

3812
02:52:22,690 --> 02:52:24,610
I dream that I don't see it.

3813
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:27,250
I sort of insist on the different units.

3814
02:52:27,250 --> 02:52:30,670
You go winged but never flying.

3815
02:52:30,670 --> 02:52:32,510
Fast but rarely flinging.

3816
02:52:32,510 --> 02:52:40,510
Your wander leads you to things you never thought you chased.

3817
02:52:40,510 --> 02:52:41,469
Along us.

3818
02:52:41,469 --> 02:52:48,420
Thought we agreed I would be the one who you confided in.

3819
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:49,540
The rain will pause.

3820
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:50,500
I just ignore you.

3821
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:51,000
Huh?

3822
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:53,059
I just ignore Thomas.

3823
02:52:53,059 --> 02:52:54,340
I mean, I didn't even look at you.

3824
02:52:56,780 --> 02:52:58,780
The rain will pause in the morning.

3825
02:52:58,780 --> 02:52:59,899
Do not worry much,

3826
02:52:59,899 --> 02:53:01,100
for you will love yourself.

3827
02:53:01,819 --> 02:53:03,579
Lonelier though it may make you.

3828
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:07,739
By the way, there was a queen in my dream last night.

3829
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:11,069
In case that's important.

3830
02:53:13,149 --> 02:53:14,590
She halts momentarily.

3831
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:19,629
The stillness of a startled bird.

3832
02:53:19,629 --> 02:53:22,590
Some dreams are only flights of fancy.

3833
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:25,709
No, but like there was also a king and a castle

3834
02:53:25,709 --> 02:53:29,309
and there was these giant motorized vehicles with tires.

3835
02:53:31,329 --> 02:53:32,530
The night elapses.

3836
02:53:32,530 --> 02:53:36,739
The rain sounds like a river of dragonflies flowing by.

3837
02:53:36,739 --> 02:53:38,739
Snoring thunder is occasional and soft.

3838
02:53:38,739 --> 02:53:41,280
Growing ever more distant.

3839
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:42,239
Along us.

3840
02:53:42,239 --> 02:53:43,120
And Thomas.

3841
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:44,799
Sleep at some point.

3842
02:53:44,799 --> 02:53:45,680
Taking turns.

3843
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:47,120
Am I just stuck out in the rain?

3844
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,120
Yeah.

3845
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:49,920
I think you're in the rain.

3846
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,239
This is my life.

3847
02:53:50,239 --> 02:53:52,159
I'm such a disgusting loner.

3848
02:53:52,159 --> 02:53:55,620
The woman walks out into the pale predawn.

3849
02:53:55,620 --> 02:53:57,780
Without a sound or a pain.

3850
02:53:57,780 --> 02:54:03,649
Or any observed moment of metamorphosis.

3851
02:54:03,649 --> 02:54:05,659
Along us wakes up.

3852
02:54:05,659 --> 02:54:06,139
Boing.

3853
02:54:06,139 --> 02:54:09,020
You have crow wings on your back?

3854
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:11,389
What's happening to you?

3855
02:54:11,389 --> 02:54:14,190
They'll continue on to word hero index.

3856
02:54:15,950 --> 02:54:17,389
Is that the name of a town?

3857
02:54:17,389 --> 02:54:18,510
It's a random town.

3858
02:54:18,510 --> 02:54:19,870
Yeah, they just randomly name them.

3859
02:54:19,870 --> 02:54:21,469
Word hero index.

3860
02:54:22,110 --> 02:54:23,709
Hey Thomas, there you are.

3861
02:54:23,709 --> 02:54:24,829
Along us with you.

3862
02:54:24,829 --> 02:54:25,790
Couldn't find you in the rain.

3863
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:26,270
That's a camp.

3864
02:54:26,270 --> 02:54:28,530
What the fuck is out on your back?

3865
02:54:28,530 --> 02:54:31,549
I'm a bird dog.

3866
02:54:31,549 --> 02:54:32,049
Fight.

3867
02:54:33,659 --> 02:54:35,180
Time to dry out these wings.

3868
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:37,020
So now you have wings.

3869
02:54:37,020 --> 02:54:41,659
Your character is so much cooler than all everything.

3870
02:54:41,659 --> 02:54:44,219
Thomas is just normal guy in a robe.

3871
02:54:44,219 --> 02:54:44,620
Yeah.

3872
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:46,700
I'm like, I've got like a stone face.

3873
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:48,700
And along us is like a winged wolf.

3874
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:52,260
Can I get like laser eyes or something eventually here?

3875
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:54,020
I don't think it does anything.

3876
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:55,219
All right.

3877
02:54:55,219 --> 02:54:57,059
So maybe maybe increases your movement or something.

3878
02:54:57,059 --> 02:54:57,700
I don't know.

3879
02:54:57,700 --> 02:54:59,440
So what are we?

3880
02:54:59,440 --> 02:55:01,440
We've been attacked or something?

3881
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:02,639
I kicked the door open.

3882
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:03,200
Oh god.

3883
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:04,079
Oh, okay.

3884
02:55:04,079 --> 02:55:10,430
I just walked back and forth like an idiot.

3885
02:55:15,010 --> 02:55:17,090
Does your sentinel trigger if they walk up to you?

3886
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:18,370
Or they have to walk by?

3887
02:55:18,370 --> 02:55:20,690
If they move within two spaces, I'll run.

3888
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:23,010
So if they move, I'll run into the building.

3889
02:55:23,010 --> 02:55:26,670
So if you want like a defense bonus to be next to Thomas.

3890
02:55:26,670 --> 02:55:29,200
All that.

3891
02:55:34,110 --> 02:55:34,610
Dogged.

3892
02:55:36,750 --> 02:55:37,250
Alarm.

3893
02:55:37,790 --> 02:55:41,489
Damn, you guys really just do.

3894
02:55:41,489 --> 02:55:42,450
You guys just crush.

3895
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:47,329
Stormthroat bird?

3896
02:55:48,129 --> 02:55:49,489
What the fuck did you do to me?

3897
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:55,500
One shred damage at the start of every turn.

3898
02:55:56,219 --> 02:56:00,770
Oh, wait, I can shoo the bird away.

3899
02:56:00,770 --> 02:56:01,329
My turn.

3900
02:56:01,329 --> 02:56:01,809
There we go.

3901
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:04,290
I just smashed that.

3902
02:56:05,090 --> 02:56:06,290
There could have been a device in there.

3903
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,969
There could have been like a weapon button.

3904
02:56:13,579 --> 02:56:14,459
I can't really get in there.

3905
02:56:15,100 --> 02:56:16,799
I can move.

3906
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:19,709
Let's go up here.

3907
02:56:20,350 --> 02:56:21,969
Well, I think I need.

3908
02:56:21,969 --> 02:56:23,090
I guess I could take the axe out.

3909
02:56:23,569 --> 02:56:29,149
They're leaving you in the yard.

3910
02:56:29,149 --> 02:56:29,629
An alarm.

3911
02:56:29,629 --> 02:56:31,569
So I think something's gonna come.

3912
02:56:31,569 --> 02:56:32,209
They're not leaving.

3913
02:56:32,209 --> 02:56:34,450
Guys, I am like the casters support.

3914
02:56:34,450 --> 02:56:36,290
I am not supposed to be up there fighting.

3915
02:56:36,290 --> 02:56:40,770
I'm supposed to be back throwing fireballs at walls and collecting stones and stuff.

3916
02:56:45,219 --> 02:56:45,700
Oh, shit.

3917
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:56,719
I will block his route to you.

3918
02:56:56,719 --> 02:56:58,639
Oh, that's so you don't want to be next to the bench.

3919
02:57:01,899 --> 02:57:02,940
You fool.

3920
02:57:02,940 --> 02:57:04,219
You what have you done?

3921
02:57:06,670 --> 02:57:16,530
Actually, I'm going in.

3922
02:57:16,530 --> 02:57:17,329
Oh, my God.

3923
02:57:17,329 --> 02:57:18,049
There's more than one.

3924
02:57:18,049 --> 02:57:18,290
All right.

3925
02:57:18,290 --> 02:57:20,930
I have to get in here because I can't target anything.

3926
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:25,090
Hey, there's nothing in this room, guys.

3927
02:57:25,729 --> 02:57:27,090
You're just alone in there.

3928
02:57:27,250 --> 02:57:31,329
But plus 35 to Lona, I remember.

3929
02:57:31,329 --> 02:57:35,100
Oh, you guys go.

3930
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:35,979
You guys got the easy.

3931
02:57:36,540 --> 02:57:37,659
Oh, good.

3932
02:57:37,659 --> 02:57:40,139
You talk about how much damage we do and then you just do the same damage.

3933
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:43,899
Yeah, but I need a network to attack people.

3934
02:57:44,620 --> 02:57:45,180
Yeah, that's true.

3935
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:46,620
You got like a big spider web going.

3936
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:47,760
Yeah.

3937
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:49,840
Well, my character is actually bottom tier.

3938
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:51,360
You shaker of traction.

3939
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:54,879
It's a new one that also contains a melee strike.

3940
02:57:54,879 --> 02:58:00,079
If they get too close, you can probably replace the axe with a melee one.

3941
02:58:01,569 --> 02:58:04,690
Yeah, I wonder because that's just spell.

3942
02:58:04,690 --> 02:58:06,209
Is it more spell damage than the wand?

3943
02:58:06,209 --> 02:58:08,530
Yeah, it gives you plus two spells.

3944
02:58:08,530 --> 02:58:11,250
I wonder if the spell damage like applies even if you're not using it.

3945
02:58:11,250 --> 02:58:11,729
I wonder.

3946
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:12,850
We'll find out.

3947
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:19,139
What's that over there?

3948
02:58:28,370 --> 02:58:29,729
Are you OK?

3949
02:58:42,270 --> 02:58:43,870
Swooping in like vultures.

3950
02:58:43,870 --> 02:58:44,829
They killed everyone.

3951
02:58:44,829 --> 02:58:46,110
My friends, my family.

3952
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:52,319
I don't know why these aren't like voice dialogues.

3953
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:55,280
He's I don't know why I was there.

3954
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:57,040
And I've lost track of time.

3955
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:59,120
Perhaps they meant to keep me as a meal.

3956
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:03,680
I have no family to go back to.

3957
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:04,559
I have nothing.

3958
02:59:07,059 --> 02:59:09,459
Don't force me back to that empty village.

3959
02:59:09,459 --> 02:59:10,819
Take me with you instead.

3960
02:59:10,819 --> 02:59:12,979
Let me seek your vengeance by your side.

3961
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:18,850
OK, so we can either bring him with us

3962
02:59:18,850 --> 02:59:20,129
and cost two legacy points

3963
02:59:20,129 --> 02:59:21,889
and then we have a fourth character forever

3964
02:59:21,889 --> 02:59:23,170
that someone has to control.

3965
02:59:23,170 --> 02:59:26,690
I refuse or we can just turn him down

3966
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:28,209
and leave him in the ruins of his village.

3967
02:59:30,260 --> 02:59:30,659
All right.

3968
02:59:30,659 --> 02:59:32,979
I mean, I guess it's been decided.

3969
02:59:32,979 --> 02:59:35,139
Revengeance will only eat away at you

3970
02:59:35,860 --> 02:59:37,940
and it's not a good reason to leave your home.

3971
02:59:39,870 --> 02:59:40,750
Maybe you're right.

3972
02:59:42,430 --> 02:59:43,709
Gave up so fast.

3973
02:59:43,709 --> 02:59:44,670
The end.

3974
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:46,110
What a loser.

3975
02:59:46,110 --> 02:59:48,030
He's not cut out for this life.

3976
02:59:48,030 --> 02:59:48,590
He's not.

3977
02:59:49,469 --> 02:59:49,709
All right.

3978
02:59:49,709 --> 02:59:50,510
Should we find an item?

3979
02:59:51,069 --> 02:59:52,430
Wait, we don't have much time there, right?

3980
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:52,909
Should we just?

3981
02:59:52,909 --> 02:59:53,629
We we're out.

3982
02:59:53,629 --> 02:59:55,709
Yeah, we have only like 295 days

3983
02:59:55,709 --> 02:59:58,030
before the world collapses or whatever happens.

3984
02:59:58,909 --> 03:00:00,829
We're just going to rush from town to town.

3985
03:00:00,829 --> 03:00:02,829
I have a wild suggestion.

3986
03:00:02,829 --> 03:00:06,659
OK, what if we just go to like the nicest town

3987
03:00:06,659 --> 03:00:11,469
and just hang out for 300 days to hang out with you anymore?

3988
03:00:11,469 --> 03:00:12,430
You're a crow wolf.

3989
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:16,700
Everyone's afraid of you.

3990
03:00:16,700 --> 03:00:18,540
OK, I've got one.

3991
03:00:19,979 --> 03:00:21,500
What's your favorite fruit?

3992
03:00:21,500 --> 03:00:26,239
Never have a cliff cherry.

3993
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:29,600
They're rare, but worth splurging on at least once in your life.

3994
03:00:30,159 --> 03:00:31,440
What's happening to Thomas's voice?

3995
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:34,159
He's he didn't age like 20 years or something.

3996
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:35,899
Oh, you did age 10 years.

3997
03:00:35,899 --> 03:00:38,620
Yeah, I mean, a little bit gray in your hair.

3998
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:39,500
That's a little older.

3999
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:39,739
Yeah.

4000
03:00:39,739 --> 03:00:39,979
All right.

4001
03:00:39,979 --> 03:00:40,379
Hold on.

4002
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:41,500
I'll fix it.

4003
03:00:43,389 --> 03:00:44,670
Careful there.

4004
03:00:44,670 --> 03:00:48,340
Your fancy taste is showing.

4005
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:49,700
Next up, a difficult one.

4006
03:00:51,940 --> 03:00:53,860
Favorite thing to fight.

4007
03:00:53,860 --> 03:00:56,899
What?

4008
03:00:56,899 --> 03:00:59,459
That's like asking my favorite rash.

4009
03:01:02,850 --> 03:01:03,969
Least favorite, then.

4010
03:01:09,809 --> 03:01:12,049
Is that because they're over the next hill?

4011
03:01:12,049 --> 03:01:18,110
It's the ick factor and even worse than frixel.

4012
03:01:18,110 --> 03:01:23,379
They don't taste bread and they're like walking diseases.

4013
03:01:23,379 --> 03:01:28,299
And here I am making a career.

4014
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:33,180
I feel like you should start adding some crows to your.

4015
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:36,780
You are really trying to get this callback for this role, by the way.

4016
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:37,280
Yeah.

4017
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:40,540
I wonder if the casting director is going to call you back.

4018
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:47,500
This guy wants to be a dog so bad.

4019
03:01:52,829 --> 03:01:55,629
Sometimes I wonder if it's not too late to start over somewhere.

4020
03:01:55,629 --> 03:01:56,989
I wouldn't know realistically.

4021
03:01:59,549 --> 03:02:01,229
Why are we talking about our favorite foods?

4022
03:02:02,459 --> 03:02:04,219
Well, we appreciate that.

4023
03:02:04,219 --> 03:02:04,860
I turned it.

4024
03:02:04,860 --> 03:02:08,299
What's your favorite food into like my life doesn't mean anything anymore.

4025
03:02:10,299 --> 03:02:11,260
Maybe I can start over.

4026
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:12,219
Maybe it's not too late.

4027
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:14,459
Oh, Cliffberries.

4028
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:16,860
I'm half wolf quarter bird.

4029
03:02:17,979 --> 03:02:18,940
What about you?

4030
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:20,860
What keeps you on this mortal plane?

4031
03:02:21,579 --> 03:02:23,100
I can't last another day.

4032
03:02:23,659 --> 03:02:26,579
The opportunity to make history.

4033
03:02:26,579 --> 03:02:28,260
Honestly, the gear.

4034
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:29,379
You mean other than you.

4035
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:36,399
The face is too good.

4036
03:02:36,399 --> 03:02:38,559
I'm like rejecting you.

4037
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:40,239
We're married.

4038
03:02:40,239 --> 03:02:41,040
And you're cringing.

4039
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:42,079
You're visibly cringing.

4040
03:02:42,079 --> 03:02:44,079
Why are you cringing?

4041
03:02:44,079 --> 03:02:45,520
Yeah, he's doing like a wolf cringe.

4042
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:48,000
You should not be cringing to this.

4043
03:02:50,110 --> 03:02:51,870
So many things, really.

4044
03:02:51,950 --> 03:02:53,950
That laughy form.

4045
03:02:53,950 --> 03:02:55,309
That dazzling smile.

4046
03:02:55,309 --> 03:02:57,309
The way you whisper my name before a fight.

4047
03:02:59,229 --> 03:03:00,750
Okay, I got to do that from now on.

4048
03:03:00,750 --> 03:03:03,139
That's not an answer.

4049
03:03:03,139 --> 03:03:04,899
That's random flattery.

4050
03:03:04,899 --> 03:03:09,219
He's just power game dude to whispering his name before a fight.

4051
03:03:09,219 --> 03:03:14,260
Plus, what kind of man would I be if I left you to get picked up by some beefy Gorgon?

4052
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:18,959
I just said Gorgons are my least favorite enemy.

4053
03:03:20,899 --> 03:03:21,459
True.

4054
03:03:21,459 --> 03:03:22,180
Come hither.

4055
03:03:22,180 --> 03:03:23,620
Away from those tentacles.

4056
03:03:24,479 --> 03:03:25,520
And I'm toast.

4057
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:27,649
Oh, wait, you're a hentai guy?

4058
03:03:29,809 --> 03:03:33,170
Thomas and Longus gain temporary damage and potency.

4059
03:03:33,170 --> 03:03:35,329
Dude, I'm going to be so low in the night.

4060
03:03:37,409 --> 03:03:39,649
Oh, Thomas.

4061
03:03:39,649 --> 03:03:46,639
Oh, get the squirrel.

4062
03:03:46,639 --> 03:03:47,280
Wait, are we?

4063
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:47,760
Get the squirrel.

4064
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:48,239
Check it out.

4065
03:03:48,239 --> 03:03:48,879
Get the squirrel.

4066
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:49,840
Squirrel.

4067
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:56,639
Where's the squirrel?

4068
03:03:56,639 --> 03:03:57,200
Get the squirrel.

4069
03:03:57,200 --> 03:03:58,000
We're ready to go.

4070
03:03:58,000 --> 03:03:58,879
Get the squirrel.

4071
03:03:58,879 --> 03:03:59,360
I need to...

4072
03:04:01,379 --> 03:04:04,500
Do you want a water crossbow or a water dueling sword?

4073
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:07,700
Can we give you like water legs or something?

4074
03:04:07,700 --> 03:04:08,739
Can you transform again?

4075
03:04:08,979 --> 03:04:20,260
I feel like Thomas's side quest is going to be so mundane.

4076
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:21,860
He's going to be like, hey, do you guys want to play Uno?

4077
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:23,860
And then we just play Uno.

4078
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:28,100
Well, yeah, wasn't your original side quest that you had, wasn't it?

4079
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:30,270
Oh, let's play Dice for five minutes.

4080
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:31,629
Yeah, yeah, it was.

4081
03:04:32,190 --> 03:04:37,700
Okay, you got Spineful, the water crossbow.

4082
03:04:38,340 --> 03:04:41,379
I renamed it to Doomsday of Doombow.

4083
03:04:42,100 --> 03:04:46,739
Interesting.

4084
03:04:46,739 --> 03:04:47,459
All right, using.

4085
03:04:48,260 --> 03:04:51,729
I'm about to die, by the way.

4086
03:04:52,450 --> 03:04:52,770
All right.

4087
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:14,899
We're in the middle of a battle.

4088
03:05:14,899 --> 03:05:15,620
You need to focus.

4089
03:05:20,450 --> 03:05:21,409
Oh, my one eye.

4090
03:05:23,010 --> 03:05:23,889
Sorry, I got the bucket.

4091
03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:25,569
All right, I'm going to...

4092
03:05:25,569 --> 03:05:27,659
Oh, I can do Shackle.

4093
03:05:32,899 --> 03:05:33,219
Sick.

4094
03:05:42,590 --> 03:05:45,709
All right, I just heard these crow sounds.

4095
03:05:45,709 --> 03:05:47,870
I thought that was your character.

4096
03:05:47,870 --> 03:05:52,030
Oh, wait, if anything attacks Thomas, you get plus four damage.

4097
03:05:52,030 --> 03:05:52,430
Yeah.

4098
03:05:52,430 --> 03:05:52,829
Really?

4099
03:05:53,549 --> 03:05:55,229
Yeah, we've been over this.

4100
03:05:55,549 --> 03:05:56,430
Love is vengeance.

4101
03:06:05,250 --> 03:06:08,290
I think we're just rolling balls of infinite damage.

4102
03:06:10,530 --> 03:06:11,809
We're pretty strong, actually.

4103
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:13,920
That's what I'm saying.

4104
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:15,440
Like, let's just wait 300 days.

4105
03:06:16,159 --> 03:06:17,280
No, that would be...

4106
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:17,760
Oh, oh.

4107
03:06:18,559 --> 03:06:22,670
I got him.

4108
03:06:22,670 --> 03:06:23,549
You got him?

4109
03:06:23,549 --> 03:06:29,700
Oh, my.

4110
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:30,979
You killed him in one hit.

4111
03:06:30,979 --> 03:06:31,219
Nice.

4112
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:33,219
I do have a really big habit.

4113
03:06:33,780 --> 03:06:37,440
Take this.

4114
03:06:38,079 --> 03:06:39,520
Time for the melee wand.

4115
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:45,649
There we go.

4116
03:06:45,649 --> 03:06:53,069
Can I do this through walls?

4117
03:06:53,069 --> 03:06:53,950
Probably not.

4118
03:06:53,950 --> 03:06:55,229
That was a really stupid question.

4119
03:06:57,940 --> 03:06:59,620
No, you're not stupid.

4120
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:00,260
Stupid, honey.

4121
03:07:01,059 --> 03:07:01,379
Thanks.

4122
03:07:01,379 --> 03:07:01,940
I appreciate it.

4123
03:07:02,659 --> 03:07:16,670
Dude, Thomas is falling behind.

4124
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:18,930
I'm all right.

4125
03:07:19,969 --> 03:07:20,930
Another crit chance.

4126
03:07:21,649 --> 03:07:23,100
We all have a slot, right?

4127
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:26,719
Yeah, it's going to take you past 20.

4128
03:07:26,719 --> 03:07:27,520
That's pretty good.

4129
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:28,000
I'll take it.

4130
03:07:28,719 --> 03:07:32,350
It's not color, is it?

4131
03:07:33,069 --> 03:07:36,000
Because we know who that would have been for.

4132
03:07:37,569 --> 03:07:38,610
Do you remember...

4133
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:39,889
Do people still do this in WoW?

4134
03:07:40,610 --> 03:07:42,850
I haven't really played it too intently or deeply,

4135
03:07:42,850 --> 03:07:44,290
but I remember back in the day,

4136
03:07:45,649 --> 03:07:48,370
everyone always agreed that you don't need...

4137
03:07:48,530 --> 03:07:50,370
You need, you know, greed, right?

4138
03:07:50,370 --> 03:07:51,090
If you don't need it,

4139
03:07:51,090 --> 03:07:52,530
you just greed it or you pass on it, right?

4140
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:55,040
Is this those people in the five mans

4141
03:07:55,040 --> 03:07:57,280
that just need every single item?

4142
03:07:57,280 --> 03:07:58,000
This is...

4143
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,280
You got a custom quest?

4144
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:00,399
Yeah, this is what it is.

4145
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:06,940
Thomas and Inon are called to a hill village

4146
03:08:06,940 --> 03:08:09,739
where an acquaintance of theirs has lost her wife.

4147
03:08:11,149 --> 03:08:13,549
After this rain comes, the farms will prosper again.

4148
03:08:14,110 --> 03:08:20,030
Not if there's no farmers left.

4149
03:08:20,030 --> 03:08:22,659
It's been a dry fall.

4150
03:08:22,659 --> 03:08:23,860
That's all I mean.

4151
03:08:23,860 --> 03:08:27,809
The funerary rites are brief.

4152
03:08:27,809 --> 03:08:29,569
The crowd that's gathered is impressive.

4153
03:08:30,129 --> 03:08:31,090
Such a small town.

4154
03:08:33,309 --> 03:08:34,909
As mourners disperse,

4155
03:08:34,909 --> 03:08:37,229
Thomas and Inon spot Baladchi

4156
03:08:37,229 --> 03:08:39,069
standing by a flower-strung cart

4157
03:08:39,069 --> 03:08:40,430
bearing a leaf-shrouded body.

4158
03:08:41,229 --> 03:08:45,360
Baladchi.

4159
03:08:45,360 --> 03:08:47,840
We're sorry to hear about Arthel.

4160
03:08:47,840 --> 03:08:49,360
Who are these people?

4161
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:50,399
A lot of folks came.

4162
03:08:56,420 --> 03:08:57,379
Do we not...

4163
03:08:57,379 --> 03:08:59,139
Wait, have we been here before?

4164
03:08:59,139 --> 03:09:01,219
How many years has it been?

4165
03:09:01,219 --> 03:09:02,500
No, we haven't.

4166
03:09:02,500 --> 03:09:05,139
I think we walked through this place during the...

4167
03:09:05,139 --> 03:09:06,819
Up the road to her home on the hill.

4168
03:09:06,819 --> 03:09:11,250
Oh gee, you lose perspective sometimes.

4169
03:09:11,250 --> 03:09:13,250
Easy enough to do, sadly.

4170
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:15,329
You think you all have years together.

4171
03:09:15,329 --> 03:09:16,290
Decades.

4172
03:09:16,290 --> 03:09:19,059
From your first hike to your middle years.

4173
03:09:19,059 --> 03:09:20,559
Old age.

4174
03:09:20,559 --> 03:09:21,809
Then.

4175
03:09:21,809 --> 03:09:24,350
And but...

4176
03:09:24,350 --> 03:09:25,840
Mickey Mouse?

4177
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:26,000
Yeah.

4178
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:29,280
To help Baladchi transfer the shrouded body

4179
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:31,120
to a small prepared clay room

4180
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,479
besides the house.

4181
03:09:32,479 --> 03:09:35,360
They settle inside

4182
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:37,120
and she tells them of her plan.

4183
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:39,760
One of the provincial customs she's observing.

4184
03:09:39,760 --> 03:09:43,340
Oh gee, Green Valley is called

4185
03:09:43,340 --> 03:09:45,340
a woven shrouded dawnshard.

4186
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:48,239
Dawnshard grows thick around here.

4187
03:09:48,239 --> 03:09:50,079
In little woodlands you'll see

4188
03:09:50,079 --> 03:09:51,600
there's a strong aroma.

4189
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:53,120
The body stays fresh

4190
03:09:53,120 --> 03:09:55,600
sometimes as long as four years or five.

4191
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:59,840
By the way, you are just doing the other voice

4192
03:10:00,479 --> 03:10:02,319
but without the wolf on it.

4193
03:10:04,350 --> 03:10:06,030
Oh yeah, I'm just having a little bit of...

4194
03:10:06,829 --> 03:10:08,829
Just doing this one hair.

4195
03:10:08,829 --> 03:10:13,360
Keep hiking, man.

4196
03:10:13,360 --> 03:10:14,000
Keep it up.

4197
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:20,290
We help folks genuinely build a wide shroud

4198
03:10:20,290 --> 03:10:33,440
as it means she'd be buried.

4199
03:10:33,440 --> 03:10:35,680
There's something very silencing in that.

4200
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:40,020
I think it's a good tradition.

4201
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:42,180
But I don't plan on waiting.

4202
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:44,819
You don't?

4203
03:10:44,819 --> 03:10:46,500
Plan's a wait.

4204
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:48,180
So you plan to bury her soon?

4205
03:10:48,180 --> 03:10:50,620
Tonight even?

4206
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:51,680
No.

4207
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:53,040
My wife, I already settled

4208
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:54,799
and I will be going on a journey.

4209
03:10:54,799 --> 03:10:58,590
Hope you'd come along.

4210
03:10:58,590 --> 03:10:59,229
Brack.

4211
03:10:59,229 --> 03:11:07,899
Hard, sudden rain falls.

4212
03:11:08,459 --> 03:11:10,139
Chittering and droning like a swarm.

4213
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:13,100
Is Andy what they're calling me over here?

4214
03:11:13,100 --> 03:11:13,739
Giving out advice?

4215
03:11:15,090 --> 03:11:15,649
What?

4216
03:11:15,649 --> 03:11:17,329
People calling me two-voice Andy

4217
03:11:17,329 --> 03:11:19,409
giving out vocal advice.

4218
03:11:21,549 --> 03:11:23,389
They're saying how I should not be giving you

4219
03:11:23,950 --> 03:11:26,190
voice tips because I have three voices.

4220
03:11:26,190 --> 03:11:28,579
I mean, you're going to criticize...

4221
03:11:28,579 --> 03:11:29,700
You're going to come at me

4222
03:11:29,700 --> 03:11:30,899
and I'm the one...

4223
03:11:30,899 --> 03:11:31,700
I'm doing it.

4224
03:11:31,700 --> 03:11:34,239
Would you like to take over?

4225
03:11:34,239 --> 03:11:34,739
Yeah.

4226
03:11:38,959 --> 03:11:40,000
Yes, I hope you'd come.

4227
03:11:43,809 --> 03:11:45,010
Be our escort.

4228
03:11:45,010 --> 03:11:46,819
It's a dangerous world.

4229
03:11:46,819 --> 03:11:47,940
And you're both strong.

4230
03:11:47,940 --> 03:11:48,440
Stronger than...

4231
03:11:49,860 --> 03:11:52,100
Stronger than I even remembered.

4232
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:54,719
Stop doing that to me.

4233
03:11:54,719 --> 03:11:55,600
It's making me angry.

4234
03:11:57,379 --> 03:11:58,579
This doesn't represent me.

4235
03:11:58,579 --> 03:11:59,219
Oh, all right, fine.

4236
03:11:59,219 --> 03:12:00,260
Let's do stirr's voices.

4237
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:03,540
I'll come along with you.

4238
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:05,299
I'm going to get a little bit of protection.

4239
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:06,979
Me too.

4240
03:12:06,979 --> 03:12:13,680
I have no idea what happened in that whole encounter.

4241
03:12:14,479 --> 03:12:15,760
It was apparently...

4242
03:12:15,760 --> 03:12:17,360
It's a friend of Thomas.

4243
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:22,190
Her wife died and she asked us to escort the body in a wagon.

4244
03:12:22,190 --> 03:12:25,600
Just west of Nightgrave Threshery,

4245
03:12:25,600 --> 03:12:28,000
Baldashi leads her oxen cart,

4246
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:31,120
carrying the body of her wife down through the hills

4247
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:32,959
into the arms of an old forest.

4248
03:12:33,700 --> 03:12:36,180
Mist rolls in as twilight takes hold.

4249
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:37,379
Behind a cloudy sky.

4250
03:12:40,700 --> 03:12:44,299
This forest was named Lagannet when it was on the maps.

4251
03:12:44,299 --> 03:12:45,579
Absent forest it meant.

4252
03:12:46,540 --> 03:12:47,819
It's not an encouraging name.

4253
03:12:48,379 --> 03:12:52,850
Can I ask about Arthel?

4254
03:12:53,489 --> 03:12:55,889
I don't think either of us have ever met her.

4255
03:12:55,889 --> 03:12:58,860
You missed your other character.

4256
03:13:01,459 --> 03:13:01,959
Place...

4257
03:13:02,899 --> 03:13:04,659
Place I'm...

4258
03:13:05,860 --> 03:13:06,659
Place I'm looking...

4259
03:13:06,659 --> 03:13:08,420
Place I'm looking for shouldn't be...

4260
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:08,920
You do it.

4261
03:13:10,940 --> 03:13:18,030
I remember you talking about her.

4262
03:13:18,030 --> 03:13:25,200
Sleeping type.

4263
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:28,899
Always wanted her to but she was never quiet and well enough.

4264
03:13:28,899 --> 03:13:32,260
And she insisted on staying home to tend the farm.

4265
03:13:32,260 --> 03:13:35,790
We met in the spring.

4266
03:13:35,790 --> 03:13:37,069
I remember clearly.

4267
03:13:37,629 --> 03:13:39,709
My grandma had just passed.

4268
03:13:40,270 --> 03:13:42,590
It sounds like Hubert from Family Guy.

4269
03:13:44,110 --> 03:13:52,700
Come here child.

4270
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:54,139
Even when you're hurting.

4271
03:13:54,139 --> 03:13:56,860
We built the farm there on Lucky Hill.

4272
03:13:56,860 --> 03:14:02,829
She liked the farm, Arthel.

4273
03:14:02,829 --> 03:14:05,629
She was kind and humble woman child.

4274
03:14:05,629 --> 03:14:08,350
She was born with an illness that never fully left.

4275
03:14:09,219 --> 03:14:10,819
Our good times were great.

4276
03:14:10,979 --> 03:14:12,659
Doesn't look kind, humble, or shy.

4277
03:14:12,659 --> 03:14:15,219
She looks like she just beat up a child.

4278
03:14:15,219 --> 03:14:15,719
Yeah.

4279
03:14:16,420 --> 03:14:18,139
I like her both in on it too.

4280
03:14:18,139 --> 03:14:19,739
Like how fucking you got them.

4281
03:14:19,739 --> 03:14:20,620
All right.

4282
03:14:20,620 --> 03:14:23,229
But our bad times.

4283
03:14:23,950 --> 03:14:25,549
When she couldn't rise from bed.

4284
03:14:26,110 --> 03:14:28,350
Those made my heart splinter.

4285
03:14:28,350 --> 03:14:29,149
And one day.

4286
03:14:29,950 --> 03:14:30,930
It shattered.

4287
03:14:31,809 --> 03:14:37,020
And there's one thing I know is that I don't want to live in that empty house without her.

4288
03:14:37,659 --> 03:14:41,649
The forest had been dead quiet.

4289
03:14:42,209 --> 03:14:43,010
When they entered.

4290
03:14:43,569 --> 03:14:44,930
As they've gone deeper.

4291
03:14:44,930 --> 03:14:47,010
Noises have filtered into hearing.

4292
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:47,889
Drips.

4293
03:14:47,889 --> 03:14:48,450
Scrapes.

4294
03:14:49,010 --> 03:14:49,729
No trills.

4295
03:14:52,020 --> 03:14:53,780
The smells have turned richer.

4296
03:14:53,780 --> 03:14:55,059
Of damp earth.

4297
03:14:55,059 --> 03:14:56,420
Spicy bark.

4298
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:58,500
Quilted mosses in purple, green, and beige.

4299
03:15:00,459 --> 03:15:01,260
Soon.

4300
03:15:01,260 --> 03:15:02,459
The ox halts.

4301
03:15:03,260 --> 03:15:04,780
They come into a clearing.

4302
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:05,819
Where a goddess lives.

4303
03:15:07,020 --> 03:15:07,520
Oh.

4304
03:15:07,899 --> 03:15:11,139
Glad she?

4305
03:15:15,229 --> 03:15:15,709
Yes.

4306
03:15:15,709 --> 03:15:17,149
I didn't find her.

4307
03:15:17,149 --> 03:15:19,469
The reason I thought Arthel was here.

4308
03:15:19,469 --> 03:15:20,750
The reason I'm here.

4309
03:15:20,750 --> 03:15:23,299
And you're here.

4310
03:15:23,299 --> 03:15:24,819
Arooey.

4311
03:15:24,819 --> 03:15:27,940
She's a goddess of borders and in-betweens.

4312
03:15:27,940 --> 03:15:30,819
This realm of hers welcomes both to death and living.

4313
03:15:31,540 --> 03:15:33,649
So I'm here to join her.

4314
03:15:34,690 --> 03:15:36,129
Slip my fucking throat.

4315
03:15:38,639 --> 03:15:39,600
Well actually.

4316
03:15:39,600 --> 03:15:40,719
You have to slow down.

4317
03:15:40,719 --> 03:15:44,000
Clearly this idea has been germinating for some time.

4318
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:44,399
I don't know.

4319
03:15:44,399 --> 03:15:44,899
What?

4320
03:15:45,200 --> 03:15:49,309
Look it's this forest.

4321
03:15:49,309 --> 03:15:50,190
I read about it.

4322
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:57,780
This goddess Arooey rules it like a region between our world and a place for the departed.

4323
03:15:57,780 --> 03:15:59,860
I suppose it exists for us.

4324
03:15:59,940 --> 03:16:01,219
For those like us.

4325
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:04,340
A place Arthel can be without pain.

4326
03:16:04,979 --> 03:16:07,139
And I can be with Arthel.

4327
03:16:08,180 --> 03:16:14,350
But isn't it just like dying yourself?

4328
03:16:14,989 --> 03:16:17,229
Crossing over to be together?

4329
03:16:17,229 --> 03:16:21,549
We'll be able to leave this place.

4330
03:16:21,549 --> 03:16:25,090
But why would she still live?

4331
03:16:25,729 --> 03:16:26,860
She will too.

4332
03:16:26,860 --> 03:16:28,139
We'll just live here.

4333
03:16:28,139 --> 03:16:32,860
You have to understand this is what I want.

4334
03:16:32,860 --> 03:16:37,659
All I need for you is to help me complete the ceremony and take the Bohoroks back with you.

4335
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:43,040
I did not expect this character was going to have this much dialogue for you to do.

4336
03:16:44,639 --> 03:16:46,639
You are monologuing as this.

4337
03:16:48,959 --> 03:16:52,959
Okay.

4338
03:16:52,959 --> 03:16:53,600
All right.

4339
03:16:53,600 --> 03:17:00,680
Okay.

4340
03:17:01,780 --> 03:17:02,899
This is your choice.

4341
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:10,079
I mean we can't just throw your life behind.

4342
03:17:10,639 --> 03:17:12,159
No we can't.

4343
03:17:14,079 --> 03:17:14,579
We can't.

4344
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:19,260
What do you mean you can't let me?

4345
03:17:22,219 --> 03:17:26,219
We're not in the business of letting friends die by any name.

4346
03:17:26,219 --> 03:17:27,739
By their choice or not.

4347
03:17:27,739 --> 03:17:29,659
I know you feel this is the only way.

4348
03:17:29,659 --> 03:17:33,520
But why?

4349
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:35,280
What proof do you have that it'll work?

4350
03:17:35,840 --> 03:17:38,559
Do you think this goddess will demand nothing else from you?

4351
03:17:46,750 --> 03:17:48,750
You're not doing this today.

4352
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:51,620
That's a starting point isn't it?

4353
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:52,739
All that matters is today.

4354
03:17:56,129 --> 03:18:01,149
Silent minutes slip by.

4355
03:18:01,149 --> 03:18:04,350
They pass without motion save for the roll of mist.

4356
03:18:04,350 --> 03:18:06,030
The blink of damp eyelids.

4357
03:18:06,030 --> 03:18:07,629
The fall of silver-struck tears.

4358
03:18:08,370 --> 03:18:15,920
Finally Baladji raises her head and addresses the shrine at her back.

4359
03:18:15,920 --> 03:18:18,239
Dear goddess I'm sorry.

4360
03:18:18,239 --> 03:18:21,920
Today I'll leave your wood to your own.

4361
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:25,120
Let me be back.

4362
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:28,430
They turn the ox around.

4363
03:18:29,069 --> 03:18:38,260
But surprising and slow a low long stretch sound coils from the stones.

4364
03:18:38,260 --> 03:18:39,219
The roots.

4365
03:18:39,219 --> 03:18:39,780
The earth.

4366
03:18:40,500 --> 03:18:42,450
Baladji?

4367
03:18:42,450 --> 03:18:44,079
I don't know.

4368
03:18:44,159 --> 03:18:49,819
As it speaks something huge crashes through the trees.

4369
03:18:53,809 --> 03:18:54,049
What?

4370
03:18:55,659 --> 03:18:56,940
Please stay.

4371
03:18:56,940 --> 03:18:58,540
It's a retainer of the old god.

4372
03:19:00,799 --> 03:19:01,840
It's gonna kill us man.

4373
03:19:01,840 --> 03:19:03,680
It's gonna keep us here and we're gonna die.

4374
03:19:03,680 --> 03:19:05,360
So wait this is what is this thing?

4375
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:06,239
What what is this thing?

4376
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:12,239
It's I don't know the stones that were part of the shrine came to life and it demanded that we stay.

4377
03:19:12,959 --> 03:19:14,719
So I think it's trying to kill us.

4378
03:19:14,719 --> 03:19:15,920
Oh shit all right.

4379
03:19:17,790 --> 03:19:18,290
Let's go.

4380
03:19:22,030 --> 03:19:24,030
The wizard runs at the giant beast.

4381
03:19:25,069 --> 03:19:25,709
Stick in hand.

4382
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:28,940
Oh he's gonna kill me.

4383
03:19:28,940 --> 03:19:30,139
He's gonna I'm getting out of here.

4384
03:19:30,139 --> 03:19:30,700
I'm getting out of here.

4385
03:19:36,290 --> 03:19:38,690
Jesus Christ.

4386
03:19:38,690 --> 03:19:42,049
My turn from the shadows.

4387
03:19:42,049 --> 03:19:43,420
All right.

4388
03:19:43,420 --> 03:19:44,299
Love is vengeance.

4389
03:19:45,700 --> 03:19:50,260
I'm just imagining somebody during this screaming Jesus Christ.

4390
03:19:51,780 --> 03:19:52,739
You're wearing different.

4391
03:19:52,739 --> 03:19:53,620
I don't know the villain is.

4392
03:19:56,020 --> 03:19:57,540
They leave the forest.

4393
03:19:57,540 --> 03:19:58,979
I can't with this fucking segment.

4394
03:20:02,239 --> 03:20:03,520
The last light lingers.

4395
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:05,200
This time of year.

4396
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:07,360
This is your side quest by the way.

4397
03:20:07,360 --> 03:20:09,120
It's not even been about you owl.

4398
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:11,760
You think we upset her the goddess.

4399
03:20:14,579 --> 03:20:16,020
Gods aren't like us.

4400
03:20:16,020 --> 03:20:17,700
The judgment isn't easy to sway.

4401
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:20,020
But they do accept appeasement.

4402
03:20:20,020 --> 03:20:21,540
Speaking from all our red anyway.

4403
03:20:22,100 --> 03:20:26,399
It's a thoughtful journey back to the farm.

4404
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:28,479
Belatia and Othell once built.

4405
03:20:28,479 --> 03:20:32,719
At least one of us should be getting back.

4406
03:20:32,719 --> 03:20:33,920
But one of us could stay.

4407
03:20:34,559 --> 03:20:38,510
Belatia seems to be developing a habit.

4408
03:20:38,510 --> 03:20:39,709
Oh you want to be in the right now?

4409
03:20:39,709 --> 03:20:40,829
No I'm desperate.

4410
03:20:41,309 --> 03:20:42,510
I thought it was her talking.

4411
03:20:42,510 --> 03:20:44,350
No you interjected and now you must leave.

4412
03:20:45,950 --> 03:20:48,989
Seems to be developing a habit for silence.

4413
03:20:48,989 --> 03:20:50,430
But then she sighs.

4414
03:20:51,709 --> 03:20:53,469
I think I will bury her.

4415
03:20:55,870 --> 03:20:57,149
I mean I mean come on.

4416
03:20:57,790 --> 03:21:01,139
I'm trying myself and slaying the god beast.

4417
03:21:01,139 --> 03:21:03,059
I think I might just bury her.

4418
03:21:05,170 --> 03:21:06,370
I'm grateful to you.

4419
03:21:06,370 --> 03:21:10,290
I'll keep in touch and oh well what can I really promise.

4420
03:21:11,010 --> 03:21:16,750
And so you guys leave.

4421
03:21:18,270 --> 03:21:21,149
She returns to her normal life and buries her loved one.

4422
03:21:21,149 --> 03:21:21,469
Okay.

4423
03:21:25,659 --> 03:21:30,059
Oh it's hard to let the good things go.

4424
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:37,170
Yeah wishes come true but not always forever.

4425
03:21:37,170 --> 03:21:39,329
Friends are useful then I guess.

4426
03:21:39,329 --> 03:21:41,809
They pull you along when you just want to lie down in the road.

4427
03:21:44,819 --> 03:21:47,299
Oh along us wherever you are.

4428
03:21:47,299 --> 03:21:49,459
Maybe time to start looking into immortality.

4429
03:21:51,059 --> 03:21:52,100
The wind picks up.

4430
03:21:52,659 --> 03:21:54,260
They take their time returning home.

4431
03:21:56,940 --> 03:21:58,940
Oh we get some fucking hotwood.

4432
03:21:58,940 --> 03:21:59,739
We took our clothes.

4433
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:02,059
We got some heartwood.

4434
03:22:02,059 --> 03:22:03,420
Thomas leveled up.

4435
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:06,399
Oh I did all right.

4436
03:22:06,399 --> 03:22:11,139
Oh I'm not doing that.

4437
03:22:12,129 --> 03:22:13,649
Maybe naturalist.

4438
03:22:13,649 --> 03:22:16,819
You could re-roll these if they're kind of weak.

4439
03:22:16,819 --> 03:22:18,100
Oh infuse ranging.

4440
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:19,840
Actually I like this.

4441
03:22:19,840 --> 03:22:22,639
That's I feel like I'm a little too far away sometimes.

4442
03:22:22,639 --> 03:22:24,290
Yeah I like that.

4443
03:22:26,690 --> 03:22:29,229
Let's head to Mist and Timberland then.

4444
03:22:29,229 --> 03:22:29,709
Push on.

4445
03:22:31,549 --> 03:22:32,590
We move on.

4446
03:22:32,590 --> 03:22:34,610
We press on.

4447
03:22:34,610 --> 03:22:42,219
By the way when I was I kind of had a moment back there.

4448
03:22:42,219 --> 03:22:43,500
When I was giving you shit bro.

4449
03:22:43,500 --> 03:22:45,420
Doing every voice like this.

4450
03:22:46,299 --> 03:22:48,780
Everybody in my chat was saying what about like Goku?

4451
03:22:48,780 --> 03:22:49,659
And if you don't know.

4452
03:22:49,659 --> 03:22:50,540
I do that too.

4453
03:22:50,540 --> 03:22:51,819
Everybody talks like this.

4454
03:22:51,819 --> 03:22:53,579
Everybody sounds like Mr Satan.

4455
03:22:53,579 --> 03:22:55,739
I just do a variation of that so I'm full of shit.

4456
03:22:57,440 --> 03:22:59,739
Everyone has two voices.

4457
03:22:59,739 --> 03:23:01,100
Yeah every yeah guys.

4458
03:23:01,100 --> 03:23:03,020
Everyone has two voices.

4459
03:23:03,020 --> 03:23:19,250
Well rumors of Gorgons have led the Bastion the Fabulous Four

4460
03:23:19,250 --> 03:23:22,610
through tangled woods to the side of a long forgotten roof.

4461
03:23:23,329 --> 03:23:28,290
Windborn rock and decayed edifices are all that remain of this ancient city.

4462
03:23:28,290 --> 03:23:32,829
Even the locals don't know who used to live here.

4463
03:23:33,389 --> 03:23:36,370
Petrified rat over here.

4464
03:23:36,370 --> 03:23:38,049
Nice of them to leave us a trail.

4465
03:23:38,049 --> 03:23:42,750
I wonder what lured them all the way out here.

4466
03:23:42,750 --> 03:23:46,190
Their trail was direct.

4467
03:23:46,829 --> 03:23:47,469
Calculated.

4468
03:23:48,110 --> 03:23:49,389
Might mean to stay.

4469
03:23:49,389 --> 03:23:51,389
Wouldn't be hard to make a place defensible.

4470
03:23:51,389 --> 03:23:52,989
The stoneworks set in good condition.

4471
03:23:56,690 --> 03:23:58,370
I forgot that your character looked like that.

4472
03:23:58,370 --> 03:23:59,090
It's been so long.

4473
03:23:59,729 --> 03:24:01,090
I jump out of the bushes.

4474
03:24:01,090 --> 03:24:05,409
One civilization falls another is built on the bones of their dead.

4475
03:24:07,260 --> 03:24:07,739
The dead.

4476
03:24:08,379 --> 03:24:14,819
Sometimes it's easy to forget they were real people.

4477
03:24:14,819 --> 03:24:15,780
Ordinary.

4478
03:24:15,780 --> 03:24:16,340
Most of them.

4479
03:24:16,899 --> 03:24:17,620
Probably.

4480
03:24:17,620 --> 03:24:22,350
Because you're a narcissist.

4481
03:24:22,350 --> 03:24:27,229
You know with all the usual hopes and fears and everyday concerns.

4482
03:24:27,229 --> 03:24:38,079
Thousands of feet must have trodden these streets every day exchanging goods and information.

4483
03:24:38,079 --> 03:24:41,409
And those must have been houses.

4484
03:24:41,409 --> 03:24:44,930
Not too fancy but the space a man calls his own.

4485
03:24:44,930 --> 03:24:46,370
I'm just you've been doing that.

4486
03:24:46,370 --> 03:24:47,729
I'm doing your voice now.

4487
03:24:47,729 --> 03:24:49,649
The space a man calls his own doesn't have to be.

4488
03:24:54,299 --> 03:24:55,260
Maybe we switch.

4489
03:24:55,260 --> 03:24:57,020
Like we've been married so long.

4490
03:24:57,020 --> 03:24:57,739
Okay let's switch it up.

4491
03:24:59,200 --> 03:25:01,360
You've given it a lot of thought love.

4492
03:25:01,360 --> 03:25:04,879
Wonder what kind of lives we could have lived if we'd settled in a place like this.

4493
03:25:12,190 --> 03:25:14,510
In the open pit of an old amphitheater.

4494
03:25:14,510 --> 03:25:16,110
Gorgon beast Bray and Mill.

4495
03:25:17,059 --> 03:25:17,780
Whoops.

4496
03:25:17,780 --> 03:25:19,059
Did we just walk in.

4497
03:25:19,780 --> 03:25:24,350
There are a bunch of them standing under that filler.

4498
03:25:24,350 --> 03:25:25,549
How about I bring it down.

4499
03:25:26,270 --> 03:25:30,319
Fire create confusion and the smoke will provide cover.

4500
03:25:30,319 --> 03:25:33,500
I'm an intimidation guy.

4501
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:34,000
Yeah.

4502
03:25:44,639 --> 03:25:48,159
They've worked.

4503
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:49,680
All enemies suffer two damage.

4504
03:25:52,420 --> 03:25:53,219
Oh nice all right.

4505
03:25:57,100 --> 03:25:59,649
Yeah where is everybody?

4506
03:26:00,209 --> 03:26:02,590
Oh they're up top.

4507
03:26:02,590 --> 03:26:11,549
Reveled.

4508
03:26:11,549 --> 03:26:12,190
Ooh howl.

4509
03:26:24,270 --> 03:26:26,190
What the fuck is your name again along us?

4510
03:26:27,180 --> 03:26:28,700
Along us baloney.

4511
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:31,420
Is your name it's like a bug us but along us.

4512
03:26:31,420 --> 03:26:33,340
Is your name actually along us baloney?

4513
03:26:33,899 --> 03:26:36,959
Yeah no isn't it along us bolognese.

4514
03:26:40,459 --> 03:26:47,020
I feel like I feel like you wrote that in for like president at like an election.

4515
03:26:47,020 --> 03:26:49,979
Like I know I'm gonna vote for our longest baloney.

4516
03:26:49,979 --> 03:26:51,899
That's who I'm voting for this year.

4517
03:26:51,899 --> 03:26:56,559
I hit random and it was lungus and I had to change it to a lungus.

4518
03:26:58,670 --> 03:27:08,290
It just had to.

4519
03:27:08,290 --> 03:27:09,409
All right I'm close enough now.

4520
03:27:09,489 --> 03:27:10,770
We're pretty strong guys.

4521
03:27:10,770 --> 03:27:12,209
We actually are very strong.

4522
03:27:12,209 --> 03:27:13,299
It's pretty sick.

4523
03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:19,700
Oh watch out now.

4524
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:23,780
What it didn't hit anybody.

4525
03:27:31,809 --> 03:27:33,729
Yeah one of my level ups was just plus two armor.

4526
03:27:36,530 --> 03:27:38,049
Yeah you're taking all these.

4527
03:27:38,049 --> 03:27:49,569
Here we go.

4528
03:27:49,569 --> 03:27:51,729
That's what I wanted to have happen last time.

4529
03:27:51,729 --> 03:27:55,520
I can kill that one.

4530
03:27:55,520 --> 03:28:02,930
I have a plan.

4531
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:12,909
Wait I thought it bumped into the other one damn.

4532
03:28:13,790 --> 03:28:15,469
Oh was it was it one tile back further?

4533
03:28:16,270 --> 03:28:18,209
Yeah he's running.

4534
03:28:21,889 --> 03:28:22,530
Destroyed.

4535
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:25,520
You activated my trap card.

4536
03:28:27,579 --> 03:28:28,780
We got level up.

4537
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:30,850
Oh we do for a lungus.

4538
03:28:31,409 --> 03:28:32,930
Yeah it's a lungus bolognese.

4539
03:28:32,930 --> 03:28:33,649
That's your name.

4540
03:28:34,450 --> 03:28:35,969
Wait you can learn to fly now?

4541
03:28:37,969 --> 03:28:41,790
Swift action and 25 dodge.

4542
03:28:47,489 --> 03:28:49,489
Like you could do melee for your rapier.

4543
03:28:50,370 --> 03:28:53,680
Dude that whole battle you just threw some rocks.

4544
03:28:55,139 --> 03:28:59,219
Damage I mean I got the bite and the claw and the ring of rhythm.

4545
03:29:01,409 --> 03:29:03,329
Either of you two upgrades your speed.

4546
03:29:03,329 --> 03:29:04,049
Mine.

4547
03:29:04,049 --> 03:29:04,770
You should take it yeah.

4548
03:29:05,489 --> 03:29:06,290
All right let me get this straight.

4549
03:29:06,290 --> 03:29:07,969
People saying that all I did was throw rocks at people.

4550
03:29:07,969 --> 03:29:11,809
Um you don't think it'd be impressive if somebody broke up a pillar.

4551
03:29:11,809 --> 03:29:15,649
Turned it into three with their mind turned into three different discs.

4552
03:29:15,649 --> 03:29:19,200
And they flew out and homing missile hit three different enemies in the head.

4553
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:21,600
Sorry I didn't um cast a lightning bolt out of my hands.

4554
03:29:24,399 --> 03:29:26,959
As they're breathing stills they hear the chittering of birds.

4555
03:29:26,959 --> 03:29:30,079
The buzz of bees overgrown grasses rustle in the breeze.

4556
03:29:31,549 --> 03:29:32,110
That rhymed.

4557
03:29:34,850 --> 03:29:35,889
Gone quiet.

4558
03:29:35,889 --> 03:29:39,579
Guess that was the last of them.

4559
03:29:39,579 --> 03:29:41,579
We should be sure before we move on.

4560
03:29:41,899 --> 03:29:43,659
Ancient settlement like this.

4561
03:29:43,659 --> 03:29:45,260
There's bound to be some hiding places.

4562
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:50,959
Not far from where they fought a section of the flagstone appears to be coming up.

4563
03:29:52,399 --> 03:29:54,879
Thomas prized some away with his toe.

4564
03:29:56,639 --> 03:29:59,200
Uncovering what appears to be a way below.

4565
03:29:59,200 --> 03:30:00,799
Oh I'm moving with my.

4566
03:30:00,799 --> 03:30:02,719
Large and muscular toe there Thomas.

4567
03:30:03,520 --> 03:30:06,319
With a little more effort they widen out an entrance.

4568
03:30:07,860 --> 03:30:08,659
How deep is it?

4569
03:30:09,299 --> 03:30:10,420
Oh I was in the zone.

4570
03:30:11,219 --> 03:30:12,100
How deep is it?

4571
03:30:13,549 --> 03:30:13,950
Stairs.

4572
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:16,000
These stairs go down.

4573
03:30:18,559 --> 03:30:20,239
Gotta check it out right?

4574
03:30:20,239 --> 03:30:21,920
Any good reason not to?

4575
03:30:24,319 --> 03:30:26,879
Down they climb into the ancient city's underbelly.

4576
03:30:26,879 --> 03:30:29,120
Slimy things skitter away at their approach.

4577
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:31,360
A rancid odor hangs in the air.

4578
03:30:34,979 --> 03:30:36,260
Torch over here let me just.

4579
03:30:38,639 --> 03:30:42,159
In a splash of light their surroundings take color and shape.

4580
03:30:42,159 --> 03:30:44,799
The passage opens up to a small enclosure.

4581
03:30:44,799 --> 03:30:46,159
An oval room.

4582
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:52,110
Bits of the rotted wood and matted straw form the pale suggestion of a bed at one end.

4583
03:30:52,829 --> 03:30:54,350
Oh smells doesn't it?

4584
03:30:57,940 --> 03:31:02,579
I was expecting a crypt or storehouse not somebody's dusty old bed chamber.

4585
03:31:03,299 --> 03:31:07,219
Wonder why they're here beneath the city.

4586
03:31:08,020 --> 03:31:14,670
Scattered around the room are what remain of a life's possessions.

4587
03:31:14,670 --> 03:31:17,870
Most are decayed or moth eaten beyond recognition.

4588
03:31:18,510 --> 03:31:21,309
That's a garment of some kind.

4589
03:31:21,309 --> 03:31:22,420
Clay fragments.

4590
03:31:23,059 --> 03:31:24,260
Pottery pieces.

4591
03:31:24,260 --> 03:31:25,379
I see something over here too.

4592
03:31:26,340 --> 03:31:30,020
If the Gorgons found this place I'm guessing they didn't see anything worth taking.

4593
03:31:32,159 --> 03:31:34,639
I can't tell if you gave up on switching.

4594
03:31:34,639 --> 03:31:35,200
I kind of did.

4595
03:31:35,200 --> 03:31:37,440
He's just slightly older so there's like a gruffness to it.

4596
03:31:37,440 --> 03:31:40,079
Well no we switched so he switched to the dog did it for like.

4597
03:31:40,079 --> 03:31:41,760
Yeah but now he switched back he switched back.

4598
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:45,440
He was like wait a second like this isn't fun to do for like four hours.

4599
03:31:45,440 --> 03:31:47,440
Yeah I came to that conclusion pretty quickly.

4600
03:31:47,440 --> 03:31:50,879
Yeah yeah like anyone would any sane person would come to that conclusion.

4601
03:31:50,879 --> 03:31:56,110
It's mental but there's one item that catches Thomas's eye.

4602
03:31:56,110 --> 03:31:58,909
A small bone flute sat atop a stone pedestal.

4603
03:31:58,909 --> 03:32:02,510
Alone it seems like to have survived the passage of years unmarred.

4604
03:32:05,420 --> 03:32:10,620
Moon colored its surface is smooth polished by the press of ancient fingertips.

4605
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:12,379
It begs to be held again.

4606
03:32:14,750 --> 03:32:16,190
There's a look I know well.

4607
03:32:20,219 --> 03:32:20,780
Oh I.

4608
03:32:23,020 --> 03:32:24,940
This thing it's in one piece at least.

4609
03:32:25,420 --> 03:32:28,940
Not that it's anything special it sort of catches my attention.

4610
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:35,729
I can't help wondering what it sounded like who played it and who listened.

4611
03:32:38,530 --> 03:32:42,610
The way it's placed I think it was treasured by the hands that held it.

4612
03:32:42,610 --> 03:32:43,489
Well looked after.

4613
03:32:45,090 --> 03:32:50,739
He you're taking the flute we know you're taking the flute.

4614
03:32:50,739 --> 03:32:50,979
Yep.

4615
03:32:53,889 --> 03:32:56,209
Oh plus 15 charisma.

4616
03:32:56,209 --> 03:32:58,159
I'll take it.

4617
03:32:58,159 --> 03:32:59,100
Yeah.

4618
03:32:59,100 --> 03:33:05,709
Hell yeah.

4619
03:33:05,709 --> 03:33:07,520
Nice bone flute.

4620
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:10,239
Thomas moves forward and carefully plucks the flute from its stand.

4621
03:33:13,090 --> 03:33:15,889
It's not doing anything down here except gathering dust.

4622
03:33:15,889 --> 03:33:18,850
Those who made it you think they'd want that.

4623
03:33:22,719 --> 03:33:27,120
That's like an heirloom writing a way to be remembered for whoever left it behind.

4624
03:33:27,680 --> 03:33:30,690
So if you want my opinion nothing is good.

4625
03:33:31,329 --> 03:33:39,020
They put out the torch make their way back to the surface and seal the passage behind them.

4626
03:33:39,020 --> 03:33:43,920
So how about a little contest find out who plays best.

4627
03:33:44,479 --> 03:33:46,239
You can't even play it with the wolf mouth.

4628
03:33:50,340 --> 03:33:51,540
Yeah how would you play that.

4629
03:33:52,180 --> 03:33:54,819
Damn it damn these wolf lips.

4630
03:33:54,819 --> 03:34:00,659
And then I stand up there and I'm like and then we all know who won.

4631
03:34:00,659 --> 03:34:02,290
All right let's build a bridge.

4632
03:34:03,010 --> 03:34:13,149
How many more days 280 285 days.

4633
03:34:13,149 --> 03:34:20,979
I'm telling you dude I'm telling you man we need to just like hang out at the bar for like two years.

4634
03:34:20,979 --> 03:34:26,610
No way man look I think this is the thing we're all we need to get to the altar yeah.

4635
03:34:26,610 --> 03:34:28,209
Yeah we're nearly there.

4636
03:34:28,209 --> 03:34:32,909
Okay well then we get to the altar and then we like camp out it's like we have tickets first.

4637
03:34:33,389 --> 03:34:38,479
Somebody said I hope something bad happens to your character so it's more interesting.

4638
03:34:42,159 --> 03:34:46,239
Yeah your character has gone relatively untouched by anything.

4639
03:34:46,239 --> 03:34:50,479
I'm just sort of a normal guy that just is like kind of here hanging out with my spells.

4640
03:34:50,479 --> 03:34:55,139
Okay what difficulties five should we patrol or should we just go for it.

4641
03:34:55,139 --> 03:34:58,139
What do you I think we go for it.

4642
03:34:58,139 --> 03:35:01,100
Just go just we're slamming right we cannot be stopped.

4643
03:35:01,739 --> 03:35:05,899
This is the final fight of the chapter when this fight is over the chat will end make sure you are

4644
03:35:05,899 --> 03:35:15,739
ready let's go oh let's do it normal guy and his furry wolf husband look at this

4645
03:35:20,739 --> 03:35:27,940
have we decided who gets the spear yet a towering reeking of algae and old water it stalks sedately

4646
03:35:27,940 --> 03:35:35,600
on its stony limbs while the world quakes it's called the calabine as 22 health is immune to

4647
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:41,600
compulsion it crushes any scenery it touches yeah we are not whatever you're sweeping attacks

4648
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:48,940
wait you're not on the map no we're we're on like a whole like we're still reading oh I skipped that

4649
03:35:48,940 --> 03:35:56,340
entirely for some reason I never got the reading oh we're like we're at the door I'm gonna watch

4650
03:35:56,340 --> 03:36:03,309
I'll watch yours oh I just I just joined oh my goodness this thing is huge 22 health and we're

4651
03:36:03,389 --> 03:36:17,790
gonna kill in one turn all right I need to get in here so I can I can fuse let me fuse with this

4652
03:36:17,790 --> 03:36:27,250
he's such a good infusion I'm biting oh uh-oh uh can you back up sir no I can't I've already

4653
03:36:27,250 --> 03:36:44,670
attacked okay oh I'm just let him on fire okay we're getting a divorce oh going right next to

4654
03:36:44,670 --> 03:36:58,700
the other one I did say if you could move and you went like oh I love his vengeance

4655
03:36:58,780 --> 03:37:05,819
all part of the plan all right let's get what we came for right don't you wonder what that

4656
03:37:05,819 --> 03:37:14,909
thing live down there there in the chamber is clear and almost sweet the corpse of the great

4657
03:37:14,909 --> 03:37:21,940
guardian shrivels inside its carapace it on approaches the edifice the spear is glass like

4658
03:37:21,940 --> 03:37:29,520
grand it radiates legacy and power it's just strange what could this thing really mean to them

4659
03:37:31,729 --> 03:37:38,319
the boars are in a normal heirloom my guess is that the hero queen who wielded this lance in

4660
03:37:38,319 --> 03:37:47,100
antiquity was actually a gargon so it's kind of an emblem to them maybe of a past hero

4661
03:37:47,899 --> 03:37:54,829
as in and grips the spear a noise begins to grow in the outer tunnels it's the noise of feet and

4662
03:37:54,829 --> 03:38:02,850
hooves of tortured lungs shoveling air and the slickering squelch of scraping things water

4663
03:38:03,950 --> 03:38:10,049
the sound of it a horde of gorgon beasts is pouring towards the chamber

4664
03:38:10,049 --> 03:38:15,520
are you crying if the story was not that moving

4665
03:38:17,760 --> 03:38:21,680
we need to hope they don't call for escape i don't think we'll survive if we stay here

4666
03:38:24,239 --> 03:38:32,459
holy shit look at that thing eight damage great spin i do have an empty slot that thing looks

4667
03:38:32,459 --> 03:38:43,840
pretty great i should take it oh where are they where are they coming from escape the gorgons

4668
03:38:44,479 --> 03:38:52,000
oh we got a whole cave is there a whole cave here yeah back back the other way oh there's a

4669
03:38:52,000 --> 03:39:02,719
door down here what did we just find if you xp we could but you're not a gamer so you don't want

4670
03:39:02,719 --> 03:39:10,610
to do that i need to get my gear score up for the dragon's expansion what do you even know

4671
03:39:10,610 --> 03:39:14,770
about gear score what do you even know about eye level tell me i have to get my light level

4672
03:39:14,770 --> 03:39:21,309
up awful noises and rank smells rush out of the dark

4673
03:39:29,889 --> 03:39:33,090
he doesn't he doesn't care anymore i can tell from a different tunnel

4674
03:39:38,819 --> 03:39:43,840
your whole chat probably mocking me oh they're just oh they're talking so much

4675
03:39:43,840 --> 03:39:47,520
shit you have no idea it's like this is like a you're having a field day right now make it

4676
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:53,299
funny does this guy really think that he's a dog they keep going omega low omega low stirs voice

4677
03:39:53,299 --> 03:39:58,180

4678
03:39:58,180 --> 03:40:01,379
and you look up like how many times like stir and cringe we're in the same sentence it's like

4679
03:40:05,940 --> 03:40:20,579
if i leave you alone uh you'll love again won't you escape is the only option

4680

4684
03:41:15,219 --> 03:41:19,299
people didn't say cringe stir they were like i love this voice i swear i'm not making it up

4685
03:41:20,909 --> 03:41:32,530
i've been carrying this marriage for five 10 15 years see how he does without me okay

4686
03:41:34,379 --> 03:41:41,840
he left what he actually left you away you you're gone you actually left gone he extracted it like

4687
03:41:41,840 --> 03:41:49,760
now if we don't go out we die i he just dodged it he oh my god really bad it's really bad that

4688
03:41:49,760 --> 03:41:57,379

4690
03:42:03,059 --> 03:42:20,739

4691
03:42:20,739 --> 03:42:25,139
that's bad this is actually not gonna have you go this is not gonna be good i think you got me

4692

4693
03:42:36,819 --> 03:42:40,979
right way oh it's all right go down you need to go down it's okay it's okay it's okay i can i think

4694
03:42:40,979 --> 03:42:49,760
i can make it from here as long as it doesn't turn around hit me i'm gonna sit here as a target that

4695
03:42:49,760 --> 03:43:00,000
was big okay just don't spawn in front of me you are so dead oh the dodge dodge again oh

4696
03:43:02,559 --> 03:43:04,239
wait you might be okay i think he's blocking

4697
03:43:07,469 --> 03:43:18,770
no thomas back on his heels pain doesn't come immediately but the wet stuff dripping down his

4698
03:43:18,770 --> 03:43:24,610
face is probably blood he's never taken a hit like this at least not one that he can remember

4699
03:43:25,569 --> 03:43:29,600
you're gonna use minus 10 retirement age but that's that's not that bad

4700
03:43:30,319 --> 03:43:36,959
focus on surviving nothing more i can do maybe i'll get an interesting character

4701
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:45,170
character edition if i do this he runs hope for the bow could be won without him maybe i'll lose

4702
03:43:45,170 --> 03:43:52,209
my nose or maybe i'll lose my lose up to my hair alone he staunches his wounds one gash

4703
03:43:52,770 --> 03:43:59,809
particularly deep that's gonna leave a scar a character defining scar character defining

4704
03:43:59,809 --> 03:44:17,180
scar let's go uh you have to make it out too though i'm gonna make it man come on you can do

4705
03:44:17,180 --> 03:44:27,149
it you're not not much further a wound if i go down it might be game over oh shit oh this actually is

4706
03:44:27,149 --> 03:44:31,680
bad i don't understand you just walk to the exit

4707
03:44:38,219 --> 03:44:45,180
oh no he sees the shadow of his foe he knows what's coming he can lean a little to one side

4708
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:53,010
or the other but it won't change much he feels something a heaviness in his hand it has a name

4709
03:44:53,809 --> 03:44:59,250
the petri glass sea spear there's a story maybe that it wants to tell

4710
03:45:00,690 --> 03:45:09,739
and only a sliver of opportunity left to tell it i can choose to break the spear or take

4711
03:45:09,739 --> 03:45:15,340
minus two health for the rest of the campaign the like main quest item and then don't we need that

4712
03:45:15,340 --> 03:45:24,700
thing i will take the the health indecision grips him the blow lance he tumbles to the ground

4713
03:45:24,700 --> 03:45:29,659
gravely wounded and clutching his weapon in the end he couldn't choose to part with it even if

4714
03:45:29,659 --> 03:45:37,889
it meant paying the price himself oh no star you have fucked us i what have you done he has just

4715
03:45:37,889 --> 03:45:42,129
enough strength to retreat and we'll spend the next days tending to his wounds over your head

4716
03:45:42,129 --> 03:45:47,649
propped up at his bedside petri glass sea spear will wait until he's ready to take it up again

4717
03:45:47,649 --> 03:46:00,399
and let it sing wait what happened victory dude look at the scar on my eye let's salvage this we

4718
03:46:00,399 --> 03:46:05,950
don't need it it's just a yeah good you were good scar i don't think anyone needs this

4719
03:46:06,670 --> 03:46:14,850
all right mystic there it is see now i get to talk like this the rest of the campaign you pull up

4720
03:46:14,850 --> 03:46:21,760
look at your scar yeah once per turn you can pull a mote of heat out of the air and create fire

4721
03:46:21,760 --> 03:46:30,510
anyway you want i'm doing that one what's mine i don't care i don't give a shit anymore i don't

4722
03:46:30,510 --> 03:46:47,340
fucking care this has to be you're the only one alive it's done oh we all of us together left

4723
03:46:47,340 --> 03:46:56,219
that canyon and cave behind the enemy's treasure in our hands it almost broke we should be joyful

4724
03:46:57,579 --> 03:47:06,399
but we know a clash is coming my books claim wars are one piece by piece trapped by trapped

4725
03:47:06,399 --> 03:47:13,180
winning one ill doesn't decide anything we can only hope this small victory buys us time wait wait

4726
03:47:13,180 --> 03:47:20,500
wait wait we don't you think that it's each one of us is saying one of those lines yeah i think so

4727
03:47:20,500 --> 03:47:33,360
yeah so we can only hope this small victory by the time you're fucking trader the game is crashed

4728
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:40,500
yeah at the end of every chapter i guess that's the first time it happened it happened to me last

4729
03:47:40,500 --> 03:47:49,790
time but no i can still see everything 10 years of peace follow okay cool wait next that's all nice

4730
03:47:50,850 --> 03:47:58,370
many chapters are there um five okay look in the top left wait that might not be it

4731
03:47:58,370 --> 03:48:06,879
i'm actually not sure oh this is during the years of peace so what happened i don't i don't oh there

4732
03:48:06,879 --> 03:48:20,190
it is a lungus carried one of the large bedroll upon his back thomas a jug of wine on his and

4733
03:48:20,190 --> 03:48:24,030
they snuck off to the hills for some time to enjoy the views and each other's company

4734
03:48:24,750 --> 03:48:32,420
okay oh you forgave me and on would only find excuses to visit humble top smelter

4735
03:48:33,059 --> 03:48:38,180
his pan wouldn't sit flat his fire poker wasn't pokey enough whatever the reason it had absolutely

4736
03:48:38,180 --> 03:48:42,180
nothing to do with the strikingly beautiful smith who sometimes brought her work there

4737
03:48:44,399 --> 03:48:50,959
i give i give her the eyes she did not have red hair it's not gonna last true a lungus went to

4738
03:48:50,959 --> 03:48:58,780
the word hero index one day to research his family name apparently disappearing into the shadows was

4739
03:48:58,780 --> 03:49:09,729
a running theme i wonder thomas tried to take a lung as shopping at the local outfitters

4740
03:49:09,729 --> 03:49:17,440
plus they gave the bats of the fabulous four a great discount but i like the clothes i have

4741
03:49:17,440 --> 03:49:26,770
how many days straight have you worn that thing hey i watched it and on fell for a shepherd's

shepherd with a different lady the smith is i told you i was down i was down bad dude and on

4743
03:49:32,540 --> 03:49:37,260

4755
03:51:04,899 --> 03:51:15,200
unlocked i did it but i feel like there was a game like the we where you put different like

4756
03:51:15,200 --> 03:51:19,760
monster parts all over the the character and they they need like battled with them

4757
03:51:20,940 --> 03:51:26,270
for the we yeah what are we thinking of impossible creatures was we played that together

4758
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:35,170
and i mean spore spore is pretty close yeah there was another one for the we too monster lab yep

4759
03:51:35,170 --> 03:51:48,610
so what are we doing with our points yeah what are we doing i mean i'm not long for this body

4760
03:51:48,610 --> 03:51:53,809
so i i don't think it would be appropriate to change jack are you ready do you want to

4761
03:51:53,809 --> 03:51:58,989
put stock in your son is that what i honestly want our our children to just jump off a cliff

4762
03:51:58,989 --> 03:52:03,229
i don't want them in our adventuring party leave them at home i want them to have

4763
03:52:04,030 --> 03:52:12,180
the life that i couldn't have yeah the adventuring life is not for them i feel

4764
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:18,290
okay all right well let's let's see how they do we have to see how the how these two do

4765
03:52:18,290 --> 03:52:23,379
i want to see how they do i mean what we're just gonna they're ready to fight they're ready to join

4766
03:52:24,260 --> 03:52:32,059
the moment that my son takes narrative like priority over me i'm gonna flip out okay we

4767
03:52:32,059 --> 03:52:42,510
need to give thomas a new oh my god he can learn the giga great stuff tier three mythic stuff

4768
03:52:42,510 --> 03:52:49,180
oh we can give you a tier two and then we can give uh we can also give along us tier two stuff

4769
03:52:49,180 --> 03:52:53,489
as well uh you know let's go to your two i don't want to take all the points okay do you want

4770
03:52:53,489 --> 03:52:58,049
are you looking at the do you want to a mage stuff or you do you want to stick with the wand

4771
03:52:58,049 --> 03:53:06,129
um i wonder what would be better for what i have right now they're the same except uh wands give

4772
03:53:06,129 --> 03:53:15,680
you plus one magic armor and stars give you plus 50 in block chance um i'll do the magic armor okay

4773
03:53:15,680 --> 03:53:21,840
tier two wand then yeah because what do i have right now you got a tier one wand yeah let's

4774
03:53:21,840 --> 03:53:32,500
get the tier two okay tier two wand upgrade boom and then for along us you want what t2 rapier

4775
03:53:32,500 --> 03:53:46,479
or do you want t2 bow probably get both along us any thoughts no i think if my arm is going to get

4776
03:53:46,479 --> 03:53:50,719
replaced and i'm not going to be able to hold weapons anymore so i don't want to upgrade them

4777
03:53:50,719 --> 03:53:55,260
we'll just like you're gonna you're gonna get like a frog arm and you won't be able to grip

4778
03:53:55,260 --> 03:53:59,870

4779
03:53:59,870 --> 03:54:10,110

4780
03:54:10,110 --> 03:54:20,770
one craft this sword is so cool and powerful that's an interesting way to describe that

4781
03:54:21,329 --> 03:54:25,329
you're reading my weapon description well none shall stand before the wielder you automatically

4782

4785
03:54:46,739 --> 03:54:55,870
narita sure the rains had some storms got a compromise into combative neighbors grudges

4786
03:54:55,870 --> 03:55:06,700
are no shelter in bitter weather oh i'll press it the rains had been falling for a full week

4787
03:55:06,700 --> 03:55:13,780
with brief interludes of tense massing clouds and dripping branches mountain snows melted in

4788
03:55:13,780 --> 03:55:24,879
water roared from the heights the seas whirled and rung at the shores flung waves ever further

4789
03:55:24,879 --> 03:55:31,420
rivers conquered their banks and marched wider valleys turned to huge brackish lakes lowland

4790
03:55:31,420 --> 03:55:38,879
woods and the dams of dry times were swept away as creatures of all shapes and kinds sought escape

4791
03:55:38,879 --> 03:55:50,930
from churning floods everything are all strict boys and i think you have to i think you have to

4792
03:55:50,930 --> 03:55:57,100
add some crow to it now yeah and you also you're also like 30 plus years older right now aren't you

4795
03:56:21,409 --> 03:56:34,639
we're not doing this don't do this after all this time with word there's no rational explanation

4796
03:56:34,639 --> 03:56:46,879
for this confluence of catastrophes rain rain old people that demons nothing's ever made sense

4797
03:56:46,879 --> 03:56:59,489
about this but oh someone's at a door the strange party of visitors begs a fire they appear to be

4798
03:56:59,489 --> 03:57:08,750
on the edge here in a common dwelling and also very soggy arnon you know we're dangerous right

4799
03:57:08,750 --> 03:57:17,649
why are you here the haggard man behind the horns calls himself arnon anon takes a long

4800
03:57:17,649 --> 03:57:24,129
breath and turns to address along us and the right fucking goofy son is in the frame ask my wife

4801
03:57:26,670 --> 03:57:36,020
sounds like a punch line that's perfect we don't get the joke ask my wife she sent me

4802
03:57:36,579 --> 03:57:43,700
can you believe that at my advanced age i grew up here in serpent sable you know it looks different

4803
03:57:50,799 --> 03:58:07,090
must be about you know what no everyone knows it's those tensor clasts the gorgons they bring ruin

4804
03:58:07,090 --> 03:58:25,569
on us all and which gorgons they're blue that checks out but i mean who's there the gorgons

4805
03:58:25,569 --> 03:58:39,649
are flooding the world they've set it in motion and it can't be stopped almost how none of this

4806
03:58:39,649 --> 03:58:50,750
should be possible i mean the racy oh i like that that's the auto field vibe you're right

4807
03:58:50,750 --> 03:59:02,659
it shouldn't be the great balance should be unassailable but somehow they've thrown it over

4808
03:59:02,659 --> 03:59:12,270
so the torrents fall the sea's thrash the soil seems blacked out our warren's it's o's tricks

4809
03:59:12,270 --> 03:59:21,700
i knew it would be oh stress oh it's the gorgons i'm saying the beasts have our warren hemmed in

4810
03:59:22,420 --> 03:59:32,559
my wife's inside dry and warm you need to talk to her hemmed in but you slip by them it's what

4811
03:59:32,559 --> 03:59:40,829
had to be me i'm a moustache looping the light i tend to be missed you don't think we're idiots

4812
03:59:41,469 --> 03:59:53,100
is that it huh why i'm on and i'm nice he certainly gives us an option a strange one

4813
03:59:53,100 --> 04:00:02,780
but it's weather these floods what else can go on if you want to watch the world sink beneath a

4814
04:00:02,780 --> 04:00:10,159
rising sea watch all land things perish they're exactly where you need to be but if you see sense

4815
04:00:10,159 --> 04:00:20,879
arnon thuds a lump of soaked fabric on the table here's a oh it's wet i mean it's a map

smiles pool in the warm orange wash of the firelight and song he plays well into the

4946
04:20:18,979 --> 04:20:25,680
late rising late on the trail late to recognize sunset and late spotting this ruin it's the

4947
04:20:25,680 --> 04:20:30,879
remains of a smallest structure and it rests on a cleared rocky slope where the trees find little

4948
04:20:30,879 --> 04:20:41,469
perches enon what do you know about this area all i've heard is that it used to be more thickly

4949
04:20:41,469 --> 04:20:50,719
settled guys you want to hear something crazy if if if enon and along us have a child then

4950
04:20:51,870 --> 04:20:57,649
we would have three new characters and then like they would all be like weirdly related that's

4951
04:20:57,729 --> 04:21:05,709
true i didn't mean to walk in on you step sis someone was born here oh your tail away an ancestor

4952
04:21:05,709 --> 04:21:17,020
of the pumpkin guy you know the guy with the pumpkins there's the serpent side line we're the

4953
04:21:17,020 --> 04:21:23,979
first down here in some time huh someone worked at the stable knife lines stains of sediment this

4954
04:21:23,979 --> 04:21:34,260
isn't about our relationship ash on the floor it's chalk what are these hash marks and what's in the

4955
04:21:34,260 --> 04:21:41,649
box no no why don't you open it and put open it really close to your face something wrong

4956
04:21:41,649 --> 04:21:47,459
that's the open border shadows back like ravens blood why is my voice being all different colors

4957
04:21:47,459 --> 04:21:57,250
you're reading the chalk off the wall i think oh i know how to read this it says i don't know

4958
04:21:57,250 --> 04:22:02,510
wait what i don't know i was lying wait you're reading a poem this place doesn't like that i

4959
04:22:02,510 --> 04:22:13,389
guess but nowhere is home perfect so do you see anything that we could use the box is puzzle

4960
04:22:13,389 --> 04:22:26,129
locked one of those magical puzzle locks oh it's a magical puzzle box magical puzzle box okay

4961
04:22:26,129 --> 04:22:29,170
interesting so like i could i could probably do that but you get you two could probably figure

4962
04:22:29,170 --> 04:22:33,569
it out you should maybe you should do it yeah useful for once you two could figure it out decide

4963
04:22:33,569 --> 04:22:38,799
to see yeah um so but i don't know how we can open that unless i think you two could probably

4964
04:22:38,799 --> 04:22:43,870
get really cozy down here and figure it out right well i think you could probably help

4965
04:22:43,870 --> 04:22:54,860
i could for once why can't we all just get along together remind me how these function

4966
04:22:54,860 --> 04:23:05,120
bogwin generations were bonkers for these things these puzzle locks yeah i could sniff or perhaps

4967
04:23:05,120 --> 04:23:12,540
there was some way i could bury my feces near our camp i could do that but the magic lock

4968
04:23:12,540 --> 04:23:21,409
presents a prompt with a clear slate to write an answer the wise wanderer finds home where

4969
04:23:22,129 --> 04:23:28,540
this is on you thomas you're the you're saying you can do this where does he find home

4970
04:23:29,500 --> 04:23:34,860
the wise wanderer finds home do i have an option or do i say it i think it's gonna give us multiple

4971
04:23:34,860 --> 04:23:41,659
choice i think no don't you don't give them don't make it easier what wait we want what's inside

4972
04:23:41,659 --> 04:23:56,129
i i veto this next i'm sure there's a systematic approach to this well air is turning out better

4973
04:23:56,129 --> 04:24:04,659
than i thought cook dinner and make a night of it talk some guesses maybe it's interesting

4974
04:24:04,739 --> 04:24:12,930
i'll grab the things i'm just as invested yeah i'll help they hold that gate on the slippery

4975
04:24:12,930 --> 04:24:17,969
steps thomas investigate investigates the blocked chimney pipe goes above ground a while and clears

4976
04:24:17,969 --> 04:24:24,770
it from the end anon's absorbed in a book he digs up it's full of creative geology a longus rushes

4977
04:24:24,770 --> 04:24:30,129
a rabbit stew and has to put it back on the fire after it does that why do we keep letting you cook

4978
04:24:30,209 --> 04:24:45,149
why do you keep killing us why is wonder where okay where where his books prove too many to haul

4979
04:24:45,149 --> 04:25:06,620
what were shrewd folks still are scarce i feel like thomas is onto it click click all right

4980
04:25:07,620 --> 04:25:16,459

5135
04:54:57,419 --> 04:55:03,500
is that the earth walls are slimy and black streams of water sloshing the side of hastily

5136
04:55:03,580 --> 04:55:10,220
heaped gravel path clods plop from the ceiling support beams have clearly been rushed into place

5152
04:58:01,919 --> 04:58:07,119
the bridge speaks of recent language you came here because you must defeat the gorgons is that

5153
04:58:07,119 --> 04:58:17,099
right we were told you like knew how i know what the gorgons did their leader i learned of him

5154
04:58:17,099 --> 04:58:26,700
oothricks these are the bad guys a hundred tucks into a bowl of beige mush looks like shroomy gruel

5155
04:58:26,700 --> 04:58:33,569
with some kind of green gold dressing ostrich like we know that name well enough

5156
04:58:35,540 --> 04:58:40,099
yes oothricks raised the great number of his brethren

5157
04:58:41,979 --> 04:58:49,659
and they went to the valley of god beast moatana that that picture looks so weird

5158
04:58:49,659 --> 04:58:54,860
yeah dude what even is that uh try a little bit of foreshortening next time

5159
04:58:58,619 --> 04:59:01,740
and if that's a great gold beast they made

5160
04:59:06,700 --> 04:59:10,139
well the gaze is on all attempting from beneath the mess of

5161
04:59:14,180 --> 04:59:22,930
this is a serious lure come on the scowl twists are already crooked features

5162
04:59:22,930 --> 04:59:25,889
arnon finishes his meal pulls out his beard and wipes it on his cow

5163
04:59:25,889 --> 04:59:37,380
oh

5164
04:59:47,970 --> 04:59:51,729
dude i love how every time you do a dumb voice they have so much dialogue

5165
04:59:52,290 --> 05:00:06,049
yeah that froze off the water and the seas and the peaks all of a turn to big blue gorgon soup

5166
05:00:07,979 --> 05:00:15,040
that sounds tasty lord it'll don't it oh the carrots and the beans i'll take it and the onions

5167
05:00:15,599 --> 05:00:23,759
so that's why ostrich needed his army to slay a god well that's the point of what the spare

5168
05:00:23,759 --> 05:00:32,900
we bled over he wasn't even fucking born yet he wasn't wait i'm realizing okay we have we got a

5169
05:00:32,900 --> 05:00:39,220
10 year gap so these kids have to be less than 10 years old right they have to be like actually

5170
05:00:39,860 --> 05:00:44,500
they're like nine with beards it's like five and seven-year-olds

5171
05:00:44,659 --> 05:00:45,299
oh

5172
05:00:47,299 --> 05:00:57,950
what matters is this motana cannot die she's petrified the reason i called upon you here is

5173
05:00:57,950 --> 05:01:02,830
i've been hoarding a certain restorative spirit still from the roots of the extinct boutaxa what

5174
05:01:02,830 --> 05:01:16,020
i call it peter root beer i love root beer pug my root beer should be able to restore the great

5175
05:01:16,020 --> 05:01:18,779
Mo'atana, if you can get it to her.

5176
05:01:18,779 --> 05:01:21,779
My brain-god is Felda.

5177
05:01:21,779 --> 05:01:27,970
Well, assuming that's true.

5178
05:01:27,970 --> 05:01:28,970
Why us?

5179
05:01:28,970 --> 05:01:32,599
Don't you have your own lackeys?

5180
05:01:32,599 --> 05:01:34,720
The deep thongs some of it is.

5181
05:01:34,720 --> 05:01:38,560
We're afraid our people are made frail.

5182
05:01:38,560 --> 05:01:44,130
What are is the worst doom?

5183
05:01:44,130 --> 05:01:49,889
The Gorgon leader is strong and fearless, so too are his hordes.

5184
05:01:49,889 --> 05:01:52,330
We are too old, slow.

5185
05:01:52,369 --> 05:01:55,810
I'm scared to die.

5186
05:01:55,810 --> 05:02:04,279
Likely story, the Gorgons aren't gonna let us do this thing, are they?

5187
05:02:04,279 --> 05:02:05,720
Don't we know where to go?

5188
05:02:05,720 --> 05:02:10,919
Well, are we sure if Ivan is gonna be so fix everything?

5189
05:02:10,919 --> 05:02:16,599
The badger grows quite asky, but I'll answer all of your questions.

5190
05:02:16,599 --> 05:02:18,360
Oh, God, please don't.

5191
05:02:18,360 --> 05:02:20,200
Over breakfast!

5192
05:02:20,200 --> 05:02:21,520
Over breakfast!

5193
05:02:21,520 --> 05:02:26,979
I'm hungry.

5194
05:02:26,979 --> 05:02:30,189
Felda is true to her word and makes breakfast.

5195
05:02:30,189 --> 05:02:31,590
The food is surprisingly good.

5196
05:02:31,590 --> 05:02:33,869
What?

5197
05:02:33,869 --> 05:02:37,659
I've only ever had mush onion soup.

5198
05:02:37,659 --> 05:02:43,779
Lastly, Felda hands over a healing ale, a single sealed earthenware bottle.

5199
05:02:43,779 --> 05:02:44,979
Soon they're on their way again.

5200
05:02:44,979 --> 05:02:52,529
They carry the hope of all the land and this creature in one fragile bottle.

5201
05:02:52,529 --> 05:02:54,400
Uh-oh.

5202
05:02:54,400 --> 05:02:56,919
OK.

5203
05:02:56,919 --> 05:02:58,680
Uh-oh.

5204
05:02:58,680 --> 05:03:02,779
Confront Ulstrichs is our last thing.

5205
05:03:02,779 --> 05:03:04,060
The real showdown.

5206
05:03:04,060 --> 05:03:06,389
He's over there.

5207
05:03:06,389 --> 05:03:07,630
This is what everything...

5208
05:03:07,669 --> 05:03:09,389
Yeah, and we're taking the kids, too.

5209
05:03:09,389 --> 05:03:10,669
Don't leave the kids.

5210
05:03:10,669 --> 05:03:11,509
The kids are coming.

5211
05:03:11,509 --> 05:03:12,990
This is a long trip.

5212
05:03:12,990 --> 05:03:15,029
We're easily gonna heal up on the way.

5213
05:03:15,029 --> 05:03:17,939
Dachan's trying to have, like, a moment again.

5214
05:03:17,939 --> 05:03:19,819
No, he's not that one.

5215
05:03:19,819 --> 05:03:21,659
This isn't his story, it's ours.

5216
05:03:21,659 --> 05:03:25,200
He gets to tell the next one if he lives.

5217
05:03:25,200 --> 05:03:27,360
I'm kind of worried that you guys are not gonna be healed in time.

5218
05:03:27,360 --> 05:03:29,119
Maybe we should back up.

5219
05:03:29,119 --> 05:03:30,680
Uh, I think we're OK.

5220
05:03:30,680 --> 05:03:31,759
I'm ready.

5221
05:03:31,759 --> 05:03:33,349
OK.

5222
05:03:33,349 --> 05:03:35,349
Is this his thing?

5223
05:03:35,349 --> 05:03:39,220
Oh, yeah, skip that.

5224
05:03:39,220 --> 05:03:42,380
No one allowed to have interesting plots in our story.

5225
05:03:42,380 --> 05:03:44,180
Yeah, especially not if they're being the Thomas.

5226
05:03:44,180 --> 05:03:47,259
At least it's not you, Thomas.

5227
05:03:47,259 --> 05:03:48,959
OK.

5228
05:03:48,959 --> 05:03:49,959
This is it.

5229
05:03:49,959 --> 05:03:53,849
This is the big one.

5230
05:03:53,849 --> 05:03:55,450
We didn't even get...

5231
05:03:55,450 --> 05:03:56,490
True.

5232
05:03:56,490 --> 05:03:59,169
We're gonna patrol this over here just to give you guys more time to heal

5233
05:03:59,169 --> 05:04:00,290
because you're, like, half health.

5234
05:04:00,290 --> 05:04:15,520
Yeah.

5235
05:04:15,520 --> 05:04:15,840
This is it.

5236
05:04:15,840 --> 05:04:19,479
All our lives we've been preparing for this eventuality.

5237
05:04:19,479 --> 05:04:20,639
We're Gorgon slayers.

5238
05:04:20,639 --> 05:04:25,000
History brought us here because our people's history must continue.

5239
05:04:25,000 --> 05:04:26,439
Be sure of your gear.

5240
05:04:26,439 --> 05:04:31,009
This is our last sleep.

5241
05:04:31,009 --> 05:04:33,700
I'm here for your love.

5242
05:04:33,700 --> 05:04:34,860
Look at him in the background.

5243
05:04:34,860 --> 05:04:35,659
Go back.

5244
05:04:35,659 --> 05:04:37,580
Go back.

5245
05:04:37,580 --> 05:04:39,380
He's lit.

5246
05:04:39,380 --> 05:04:41,779
And our kids are pretending to, like, not hear it.

5247
05:04:41,779 --> 05:04:42,979
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5248
05:04:42,979 --> 05:04:44,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5249
05:04:44,360 --> 05:04:48,580
Is my dad loving your dad now?

5250
05:04:48,580 --> 05:04:53,689
You're like eight. You don't get it.

5251
05:04:53,689 --> 05:04:56,500
They don't get gear like we do.

5252
05:04:56,500 --> 05:04:58,549
I don't. I'm...

5253
05:04:58,549 --> 05:04:59,709
Oh, my God. All this drama.

5254
05:04:59,709 --> 05:05:01,709
You still have one-star weapons.

5255
05:05:01,709 --> 05:05:02,909
You have one-star weapons.

5256
05:05:03,709 --> 05:05:06,630
You didn't grow a wolf arm, so you need to get something.

5257
05:05:06,630 --> 05:05:08,259
You need to eat them.

5258
05:05:08,259 --> 05:05:10,900
You should kill them. Betray them in the final battle.

5259
05:05:10,900 --> 05:05:13,259
You can, like, upgrade your rapier.

5260
05:05:13,259 --> 05:05:17,419
OK, hold on. I'm doing it.

5261
05:05:17,419 --> 05:05:19,500
You're giving it a terrible name and description.

5262
05:05:19,500 --> 05:05:22,860
So spend everything, apparently, because this is the very end, right?

5263
05:05:22,860 --> 05:05:24,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should.

5264
05:05:24,819 --> 05:05:27,779
Well, is there something cool I can have?

5265
05:05:27,779 --> 05:05:29,299
OK, I got my sword.

5266
05:05:29,299 --> 05:05:34,369
Yeah, we could give you, like, a tier three, like, wand or stuff.

5267
05:05:34,369 --> 05:05:36,180
Let's see.

5268
05:05:36,180 --> 05:05:40,419
Yeah, let me get this let me get this tier three wind twig.

5269
05:05:41,380 --> 05:05:42,900
Yeah, do it.

5270
05:05:42,900 --> 05:05:49,900
Is it? All right, I'm going to go for it.

5271
05:05:49,900 --> 05:05:55,759
OK, and we'll we'll give the boy a tier two staff.

5272
05:05:59,099 --> 05:06:02,419
I won't even give the boys a glance.

5273
05:06:02,419 --> 05:06:03,299
All right.

5274
05:06:03,299 --> 05:06:06,900
I was I was writing the description on that and you came over and just took it from me.

5275
05:06:07,139 --> 05:06:08,740
And we're just like, yeah, you can do it.

5276
05:06:08,740 --> 05:06:13,520
I pulled you hard. Yeah.

5277
05:06:13,520 --> 05:06:15,439
Well, I can I can go in the description and do it, right?

5278
05:06:15,439 --> 05:06:16,720
Yeah, you can do it right now.

5279
05:06:16,720 --> 05:06:24,630
Yeah, OK. Actually, we have to wait to lay out of this menu.

5280
05:06:24,630 --> 05:06:25,909
We're done. Yeah.

5281
05:06:26,029 --> 05:06:29,830
I was just etching that on the side of the staff in the corner,

5282
05:06:29,830 --> 05:06:32,709
and you came over, grabbed it out of my hands, just threw it into the side of the cave.

5283
05:06:32,709 --> 05:06:33,709
I threw it on the ground.

5284
05:06:33,709 --> 05:06:35,299
I'm sorry.

5285
05:06:35,299 --> 05:06:36,459
We can do it right now.

5286
05:06:36,459 --> 05:06:38,700
No, no, it's funny that way.

5287
05:06:38,700 --> 05:06:41,689
Wait, if we click back, right?

5288
05:06:41,689 --> 05:06:44,250
Oh, no, it's way funnier that way.

5289
05:06:44,250 --> 05:06:46,220
What does it say on it?

5290
05:06:46,220 --> 05:06:48,099
It just says lovers quarrel.

5291
05:06:48,099 --> 05:06:51,759
I was writing quarrel.

5292
05:06:51,759 --> 05:06:52,520
Oh, here we go.

5293
05:06:52,520 --> 05:06:54,000
The two the two lovebirds.

5294
05:06:54,000 --> 05:06:56,790
Let's see how this plays out.

5295
05:06:56,790 --> 05:07:06,529
No, I won't keep on.

5296
05:07:06,529 --> 05:07:09,049
The odds of our ever being here are beyond figuring.

5297
05:07:09,889 --> 05:07:12,729
Look at him.

5298
05:07:12,729 --> 05:07:18,770
Today, history hinges on the deeds of a few, very of one ordinary folk

5299
05:07:18,770 --> 05:07:23,810
and a few unique folk who took a tortured road and wound up in the way of destiny.

5300
05:07:23,810 --> 05:07:25,450
I'm glad it's us.

5301
05:07:25,450 --> 05:07:29,130
Yeah, one normal guy that got like bumped his head once.

5302
05:07:29,130 --> 05:07:30,849
And then we have all these superpowers.

5303
05:07:30,849 --> 05:07:32,209
You are a wizard though, that's kind of not normal.

5304
05:07:32,209 --> 05:07:34,520
That is true.

5305
05:07:34,520 --> 05:07:37,639
My shitty son's a wizard for no reason.

5306
05:07:38,639 --> 05:07:44,369
You know, what I like is a guarantee.

5307
05:07:44,369 --> 05:07:47,909
What if this creature we're trying to restore is just dead?

5308
05:07:47,909 --> 05:07:56,509
Like you saw, you mean the name of our image or ours.

5309
05:07:56,509 --> 05:08:01,740
A clear path climbs the hill ahead of them to whatever awaits.

5310
05:08:01,740 --> 05:08:03,599
There it is.

5311
05:08:03,599 --> 05:08:04,400
What the fuck happened to me?

5312
05:08:04,400 --> 05:08:05,479
I did some shit.

5313
05:08:05,479 --> 05:08:07,119
Some shit's gone down.

5314
05:08:07,119 --> 05:08:09,549
Yeah, this is the finale.

5315
05:08:09,549 --> 05:08:11,270
All right, let's get let's go for it.

5316
05:08:11,270 --> 05:08:13,939
Let's get it.

5317
05:08:13,979 --> 05:08:16,700
No sudden, no one pushing up willy nilly.

5318
05:08:16,700 --> 05:08:18,099
All right.

5319
05:08:18,099 --> 05:08:26,009
I'm making sure I stay alive.

5320
05:08:26,009 --> 05:08:30,200
Really?

5321
05:08:30,200 --> 05:08:31,680
Oh, there's two of them there.

5322
05:08:31,680 --> 05:08:38,900
I only saw one.

5323
05:08:38,900 --> 05:08:42,139
Nice.

5324
05:08:42,139 --> 05:08:45,490
It's me, dad.

5325
05:08:45,490 --> 05:08:48,290
It's me, dad.

5326
05:08:48,290 --> 05:08:50,130
Like dad, what should I do?

5327
05:08:50,130 --> 05:08:52,979
It's me, dad.

5328
05:08:52,979 --> 05:08:53,819
That's the job.

5329
05:08:53,819 --> 05:09:01,500
Oh, is this the final boss guy right here?

5330
05:09:01,500 --> 05:09:02,380
I think so.

5331
05:09:02,380 --> 05:09:03,099
No.

5332
05:09:03,099 --> 05:09:03,939
Well, I don't know if it's him.

5333
05:09:03,939 --> 05:09:05,619
I think he's a regular enemy.

5334
05:09:05,619 --> 05:09:07,139
Should be all strict.

5335
05:09:07,139 --> 05:09:10,290
Oh, yeah, it is all strict.

5336
05:09:10,290 --> 05:09:11,490
Have you been paying attention?

5337
05:09:11,490 --> 05:09:12,330
Jack and no.

5338
05:09:12,330 --> 05:09:15,779
Oh, like that hurt dad.

5339
05:09:15,779 --> 05:09:22,000
Jack and no bad dad.

5340
05:09:22,000 --> 05:09:24,380
All right.

5341
05:09:24,380 --> 05:09:29,299
Just throw the disc.

5342
05:09:29,299 --> 05:09:40,799
Dude, I love just throwing the discs.

5343
05:09:40,799 --> 05:09:44,900
That like hurts, man.

5344
05:09:44,900 --> 05:09:57,060
I love that voice you're doing.

5345
05:09:57,060 --> 05:09:58,459
Wow.

5346
05:09:58,459 --> 05:10:01,139
Oh my God.

5347
05:10:01,139 --> 05:10:06,669
All right, let's keep going.

5348
05:10:06,669 --> 05:10:07,750
I'm going in.

5349
05:10:07,750 --> 05:10:08,590
I think we should wait.

5350
05:10:08,590 --> 05:10:10,150
I mean, we kind of have to, right?

5351
05:10:10,150 --> 05:10:12,229
Yeah.

5352
05:10:12,229 --> 05:10:13,069
Hold on.

5353
05:10:13,069 --> 05:10:13,950
Let me scout.

5354
05:10:13,950 --> 05:10:26,610
You fucker.

5355
05:10:26,650 --> 05:10:28,939
Oh, very fitting.

5356
05:10:28,939 --> 05:10:31,229
The red tiles are shaped like a heart.

5357
05:10:31,229 --> 05:10:32,069
Nice.

5358
05:10:32,069 --> 05:10:36,299
Very nice.

5359
05:10:36,299 --> 05:10:39,819
Wait for me, Uncle Thomas.

5360
05:10:39,819 --> 05:10:41,580
Why is Thomas following us all this way?

5361
05:10:41,580 --> 05:10:42,619
No one likes him.

5362
05:10:44,729 --> 05:10:45,930
Somebody painted this on the ground

5363
05:10:45,930 --> 05:10:49,270
and I just, I don't appreciate it.

5364
05:10:49,270 --> 05:10:52,220
Oh, it hurt.

5365
05:10:52,220 --> 05:11:07,520
Ow, my bones.

5366
05:11:07,520 --> 05:11:11,549
Well, I'm have it.

5367
05:11:11,549 --> 05:11:12,389
10 damage.

5368
05:11:23,750 --> 05:11:30,000
Hey kids, time to activate order 666.

5369
05:11:31,479 --> 05:11:36,159
666?

5370
05:11:36,159 --> 05:11:37,799
I don't know that one, Dad.

5371
05:11:37,799 --> 05:11:38,759
Like, I'm seven.

5372
05:11:38,759 --> 05:11:41,459
I can't count that high, Uncle.

5373
05:11:41,459 --> 05:11:43,220
Shit Jesus.

5374
05:11:43,220 --> 05:11:44,299
We won.

5375
05:11:44,299 --> 05:11:48,180
Damn it.

5376
05:11:48,180 --> 05:11:49,540
No, there's supposed to be the boss.

5377
05:11:49,540 --> 05:11:50,380
Oh, wait.

5378
05:11:50,380 --> 05:11:51,220
Oh, that's right.

5379
05:11:51,220 --> 05:11:52,060
There is the big boss.

5380
05:11:52,060 --> 05:11:59,669
Nevermind.

5381
05:11:59,669 --> 05:12:00,509
Right?

5382
05:12:00,509 --> 05:12:01,330
I think so.

5383
05:12:01,330 --> 05:12:05,869
Yeah, it's right up here.

5384
05:12:05,869 --> 05:12:06,709
Yep.

5385
05:12:06,709 --> 05:12:07,549
This thing here.

5386
05:12:07,549 --> 05:12:10,740
Oh.

5387
05:12:10,740 --> 05:12:14,450
Send one of the kids to go touch it.

5388
05:12:14,450 --> 05:12:17,209
This fucking shaggy looking kid hasn't even said a word.

5389
05:12:18,250 --> 05:12:19,090
What do you mean?

5390
05:12:19,250 --> 05:12:21,930
I keep talking to Uncle Thomas.

5391
05:12:21,930 --> 05:12:26,180
We have been speaking this whole time.

5392
05:12:26,180 --> 05:12:30,409
Alungus, there's the time.

5393
05:12:30,409 --> 05:12:32,209
Bro, look at this thing.

5394
05:12:32,209 --> 05:12:40,759
Are you really here?

5395
05:12:40,759 --> 05:12:44,680
Alungus unseals Velda's earthenware bottle.

5396
05:12:44,680 --> 05:12:47,869
He's gonna pour it on the thing?

5397
05:12:47,869 --> 05:12:50,900
Don't see a pour-o.

5398
05:12:50,900 --> 05:12:53,659
He douses the petrified head of the god beast Moatana

5399
05:12:53,659 --> 05:12:57,930
in the spicy sweet smelling elixir.

5400
05:12:57,930 --> 05:13:01,229
We all look at it together.

5401
05:13:01,229 --> 05:13:03,099
Nothing happens.

5402
05:13:03,099 --> 05:13:05,299
Credits.

5403
05:13:05,299 --> 05:13:06,700
It's not working, is it?

5404
05:13:10,669 --> 05:13:11,509
I will.

5405
05:13:11,509 --> 05:13:13,990
We're out of time, Ostrichs.

5406
05:13:13,990 --> 05:13:16,069
Did they just give us a bottle of Sriracha

5407
05:13:16,069 --> 05:13:17,869
and just, well, I don't understand.

5408
05:13:17,869 --> 05:13:18,709
They didn't do anything?

5409
05:13:18,709 --> 05:13:20,709
They put the hot sauce on the head of the statue.

5410
05:13:20,709 --> 05:13:22,459
It was root beer.

5411
05:13:22,459 --> 05:13:23,299
It was literally root beer.

5412
05:13:23,299 --> 05:13:24,700
It was root beer.

5413
05:13:24,700 --> 05:13:28,619
We did just pour a bottle of root beer on this.

5414
05:13:28,619 --> 05:13:30,459
Why did we do that?

5415
05:13:30,459 --> 05:13:32,380
The kid all the way on the right, no personality.

5416
05:13:32,380 --> 05:13:33,259
I'm telling you.

5417
05:13:33,259 --> 05:13:34,180
Shaggy needs to go.

5418
05:13:34,180 --> 05:13:35,340
Just like his mother.

5419
05:13:35,340 --> 05:13:36,939
Like, Ostrichs showed up.

5420
05:13:36,939 --> 05:13:39,139
You know how long we've been fucking,

5421
05:13:39,139 --> 05:13:40,340
like six hours, dude.

5422
05:13:40,340 --> 05:13:42,419
Wait, Ostrich, this is not Ostrichs?

5423
05:13:42,419 --> 05:13:43,540
This is Ostrichs.

5424
05:13:43,540 --> 05:13:44,380
Whatever is over here.

5425
05:13:44,380 --> 05:13:45,540
The bird is Moatana.

5426
05:13:45,540 --> 05:13:49,580
I think, I think, I think this is, this is Thomas.

5427
05:13:49,580 --> 05:13:52,380
Cause you remember how he was reading the book at the start.

5428
05:13:52,380 --> 05:13:53,299
Oh, okay.

5429
05:13:55,580 --> 05:13:56,700
Ostrichs knew.

5430
05:13:56,700 --> 05:14:02,619
This tale was of his telling.

5431
05:14:02,619 --> 05:14:05,700
When the first land was raised from the folds of the sea,

5432
05:14:05,700 --> 05:14:08,220
two worlds were born out of one.

5433
05:14:08,220 --> 05:14:11,380
To Ostrichs, a mighty and arrogant Gorgon hero,

5434
05:14:11,380 --> 05:14:13,380
this was creation's mistake.

5435
05:14:13,380 --> 05:14:17,060
And he dreamed he'd mend it.

5436
05:14:17,060 --> 05:14:18,740
Very little has ever been known of the things

5437
05:14:18,740 --> 05:14:21,540
that scrum and scoil beneath the tides.

5438
05:14:21,540 --> 05:14:23,380
We know the Gorgons are old.

5439
05:14:23,380 --> 05:14:28,060
Old, old, old.

5440
05:14:28,060 --> 05:14:31,900
So maybe they aren't easily moved.

5441
05:14:31,900 --> 05:14:36,200
My vanity hopes we threw him some surprises,

5442
05:14:36,200 --> 05:14:41,459
but it's possible we were his fools from the very beginning.

5443
05:14:41,459 --> 05:14:45,580
We unpuzzled the stone and chased that spear of petroglass.

5444
05:14:45,580 --> 05:14:48,869
We struck a blow, I think, in taking it.

5445
05:14:48,869 --> 05:14:52,069
But our grubbing plunder of a Gorgon heirloom

5446
05:14:52,069 --> 05:14:54,330
gave him a story to tell.

5447
05:14:54,330 --> 05:14:59,229
Our species cast as the scrabbling villains.

5448
05:14:59,229 --> 05:15:02,389
Incited, his Gorgon brethren together rose behind him

5449
05:15:02,389 --> 05:15:08,060
to imputer this gentle god.

5450
05:15:08,060 --> 05:15:10,180
And the ocean rose while the rain fell

5451
05:15:10,180 --> 05:15:14,880
and the ice of the world turned to melt.

5452
05:15:14,880 --> 05:15:18,060
For a while, I'm sure he believed his dream

5453
05:15:18,060 --> 05:15:22,450
would replace reality.

5454
05:15:22,450 --> 05:15:23,290
But it won't.

5455
05:15:23,290 --> 05:15:24,130
Is this you talking this whole time?

5456
05:15:24,130 --> 05:15:27,090
Is the thing behind us unpetrified?

5457
05:15:27,130 --> 05:15:30,479
Yeah, it is.

5458
05:15:30,479 --> 05:15:34,099
Ulstrix.

5459
05:15:34,099 --> 05:15:36,790
Oh shit, that is a lot.

5460
05:15:36,790 --> 05:15:37,630
Kids!

5461
05:15:37,630 --> 05:15:40,669
Kill Ulstrix and it will keep coming.

5462
05:15:40,669 --> 05:15:42,110
Where is Ulstrix?

5463
05:15:42,110 --> 05:15:42,950
Oh.

5464
05:15:42,950 --> 05:15:43,790
I don't even know.

5465
05:15:43,790 --> 05:15:47,349
All the way in the middle.

5466
05:15:47,349 --> 05:15:51,220
Ulstrix is kind of hot.

5467
05:15:51,220 --> 05:15:52,860
That's not the kids, that's you, man.

5468
05:15:52,860 --> 05:15:53,700
That was me.

5469
05:15:53,700 --> 05:15:54,909
That's you.

5470
05:15:54,909 --> 05:15:56,709
You tried to kill Ardbar

5471
05:15:56,709 --> 05:15:58,470
and you accidentally sent yourself.

5472
05:16:05,299 --> 05:16:20,130
Oops, score.

5473
05:16:20,130 --> 05:16:21,330
That's a lot of enemies.

5474
05:16:24,099 --> 05:16:25,139
My dad taught me that.

5475
05:16:25,180 --> 05:16:29,750
I can now.

5476
05:16:29,750 --> 05:16:31,869
Whatever, this is a live through it.

5477
05:16:31,869 --> 05:16:32,709
Yeah, so he can.

5478
05:16:32,709 --> 05:16:34,270
You think you've won, beast?

5479
05:16:34,270 --> 05:16:35,110
He's dead.

5480
05:16:35,110 --> 05:16:36,310
What are you doing?

5481
05:16:36,310 --> 05:16:39,189
You've got yourself a Gorgon stabber

5482
05:16:39,189 --> 05:16:42,389
and now he's got nothing left to lose.

5483
05:16:42,389 --> 05:16:45,220
Why did you do that?

5484
05:16:45,220 --> 05:16:46,340
His final act.

5485
05:16:46,340 --> 05:16:49,880
He stabs the beast but dies.

5486
05:16:49,880 --> 05:16:51,000
What?

5487
05:16:51,000 --> 05:16:51,840
He DPS'd it.

5488
05:16:51,840 --> 05:16:52,680
Yeah, he's dead.

5489
05:16:52,680 --> 05:16:54,209
He killed your son.

5490
05:16:58,150 --> 05:17:00,659
Flame eyes.

5491
05:17:00,700 --> 05:17:02,700
I will remove all the joy from your life

5492
05:17:02,700 --> 05:17:05,909
before this is over.

5493
05:17:05,909 --> 05:17:07,650
Whoa.

5494
05:17:07,650 --> 05:17:09,369
Secret bite attack.

5495
05:17:09,369 --> 05:17:11,939
He threw an enemy at you.

5496
05:17:11,939 --> 05:17:18,659
You all right?

5497
05:17:18,659 --> 05:17:19,779
Secret bite attack.

5498
05:17:30,680 --> 05:17:31,959
I was supposed to be like crying and like screaming.

5499
05:17:31,959 --> 05:17:34,240
He's screaming for his son.

5500
05:17:34,240 --> 05:17:35,599
You're like throwing up.

5501
05:17:40,720 --> 05:17:50,369
Oh, it's horrible.

5502
05:17:50,369 --> 05:17:52,619
Damn it, I can't reach.

5503
05:17:52,900 --> 05:17:54,700
Check this out.

5504
05:17:54,700 --> 05:17:57,340
Flame eyes.

5505
05:17:57,340 --> 05:17:58,180
Light up.

5506
05:17:58,180 --> 05:17:59,020
For my cousin.

5507
05:18:07,169 --> 05:18:11,680
Ulstrix, you piece of shit.

5508
05:18:11,680 --> 05:18:13,360
My boy.

5509
05:18:13,360 --> 05:18:28,139
Just like fucking tears are just streaming.

5510
05:18:28,139 --> 05:18:30,060
I'm going for Ulstrix.

5511
05:18:30,060 --> 05:18:31,380
Spin around and just throw.

5512
05:18:31,380 --> 05:18:32,220
Go for me.

5513
05:18:43,590 --> 05:18:45,970
Big hit.

5514
05:18:45,970 --> 05:18:46,810
And again.

5515
05:18:53,599 --> 05:18:54,439
Fire.

5516
05:18:55,279 --> 05:18:56,520
Wait, how am I?

5517
05:19:01,540 --> 05:19:02,540
You're just doing it.

5518
05:19:02,540 --> 05:19:04,380
He's just doing it so wrong.

5519
05:19:04,380 --> 05:19:05,909
Oops.

5520
05:19:14,200 --> 05:19:16,139
Even more.

5521
05:19:16,139 --> 05:19:17,700
Oh, he's ignoring me.

5522
05:19:17,700 --> 05:19:18,540
Oh, no, he's not.

5523
05:19:18,540 --> 05:19:19,380
Oh, that was eight.

5524
05:19:19,380 --> 05:19:20,419
That was seven, damn it.

5525
05:19:20,419 --> 05:19:21,259
Holy shit.

5526
05:19:21,259 --> 05:19:23,900
The fire actually worked out to be in a good spot.

5527
05:19:23,900 --> 05:19:25,380
Oh.

5528
05:19:25,380 --> 05:19:27,099
Father, it hurts.

5529
05:19:27,099 --> 05:19:34,610
Ardbar is not doing well.

5530
05:19:34,610 --> 05:19:36,290
Oh.

5531
05:19:36,810 --> 05:19:38,369
Ardbar is not doing that well.

5532
05:19:56,770 --> 05:19:58,869
What's wrong?

5533
05:19:58,869 --> 05:20:01,220
I don't want to leave my rock.

5534
05:20:05,450 --> 05:20:07,409
Oh, shit.

5535
05:20:07,409 --> 05:20:08,250
No, you still have armor.

5536
05:20:08,250 --> 05:20:11,700
You're good.

5537
05:20:14,619 --> 05:20:16,220
Oh, shit.

5538
05:20:16,220 --> 05:20:18,180
One damage, all that buildup.

5539
05:20:18,180 --> 05:20:20,790
Ulstrix.

5540
05:20:20,790 --> 05:20:22,590
I need fire.

5541
05:20:22,590 --> 05:20:26,849
There's two fires.

5542
05:20:26,849 --> 05:20:29,860
Got it.

5543
05:20:29,860 --> 05:20:30,700
Come on.

5544
05:20:30,700 --> 05:20:31,540
Thank you, father.

5545
05:20:31,540 --> 05:20:32,380
Come on.

5546
05:20:32,380 --> 05:20:33,220
Wait a second.

5547
05:20:33,220 --> 05:20:34,060
Just like your dad.

5548
05:20:36,630 --> 05:20:37,470
It burns.

5549
05:20:37,470 --> 05:20:45,139
No, I was prophesied.

5550
05:20:45,139 --> 05:20:54,340
I'm really annoyed that he lived.

5551
05:20:54,340 --> 05:20:55,380
We did it.

5552
05:20:55,380 --> 05:20:58,340
The mighty Ulstrix finally crumpled before us,

5553
05:20:58,340 --> 05:20:59,860
his reeking corpse.

5554
05:20:59,860 --> 05:21:01,340
Twitch, Twitch TV.

5555
05:21:01,340 --> 05:21:03,540
Still, it was over.

5556
05:21:03,540 --> 05:21:04,540
Little plug there.

5557
05:21:04,540 --> 05:21:08,159
Some would say we saved the world,

5558
05:21:08,159 --> 05:21:10,119
but we did save the ember of it.

5559
05:21:10,119 --> 05:21:14,360
We cupped this red coal of life in our sweaty palms,

5560
05:21:14,360 --> 05:21:16,479
carried it to the next morning.

5561
05:21:16,479 --> 05:21:19,799
Through wreckage, loss, destruction,

5562
05:21:19,799 --> 05:21:22,560
it would take time for the water to go down.

5563
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:24,680
The memories to lose their bite,

5564
05:21:24,680 --> 05:21:25,720
to rebuild,

5565
05:21:26,779 --> 05:21:28,340
to heal,

5566
05:21:28,340 --> 05:21:31,700
and maybe to live new lives someday.

5567
05:21:31,700 --> 05:21:33,619
It shows us without you.

5568
05:21:33,619 --> 05:21:34,700
Not just us.

5569
05:21:34,700 --> 05:21:36,900
Just new lives.

5570
05:21:36,900 --> 05:21:38,700
Just, yeah, just these two.

5571
05:21:38,700 --> 05:21:40,380
Nobody else in the story matters.

5572
05:21:40,380 --> 05:21:42,099
But our story was the one in many.

5573
05:21:42,099 --> 05:21:43,939
Didn't you write this story in the book

5574
05:21:43,939 --> 05:21:45,299
so you writ your own downfall?

5575
05:21:45,299 --> 05:21:47,020
No, I had blank pages.

5576
05:21:47,020 --> 05:21:48,099
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

5577
05:21:48,099 --> 05:21:49,540
Yeah, I did write this.

5578
05:21:49,540 --> 05:21:51,580
Thomas the Star wrote this exact story in the book

5579
05:21:51,580 --> 05:21:52,619
and made it real.

5580
05:21:53,459 --> 05:21:55,860
So he wrote that his husband would leave him

5581
05:21:55,860 --> 05:21:57,459
and his son would die.

5582
05:21:57,459 --> 05:22:00,819
The implication was that the end of the pages were blank.

5583
05:22:00,819 --> 05:22:02,979
No, he wrote the story.

5584
05:22:02,979 --> 05:22:05,139
I wrote the story.

5585
05:22:05,139 --> 05:22:07,560
Thomas made himself normal.

5586
05:22:07,560 --> 05:22:09,680
He made his son die.

5587
05:22:09,680 --> 05:22:11,360
He made his husband leave him.

5588
05:22:17,880 --> 05:22:19,159
The end.

5589
05:22:19,159 --> 05:22:21,080
That's, yeah, I finished the book.

5590
05:22:21,080 --> 05:22:21,919
The game has crashed.

5591
05:22:21,919 --> 05:22:22,939
The end.

5592
05:22:22,939 --> 05:22:25,099
You've won.

5593
05:22:25,099 --> 05:22:27,270
Okay, the end.

5594
05:22:27,270 --> 05:22:28,470
Oh, there's an after story.

5595
05:22:28,470 --> 05:22:29,759
Hold on a minute.

5596
05:22:32,259 --> 05:22:36,250
Thomas developed a passion for restoring ruined sites.

5597
05:22:36,250 --> 05:22:38,130
He rented out the finished sites to travelers

5598
05:22:38,130 --> 05:22:39,490
at a decent nightly rate.

5599
05:22:39,490 --> 05:22:40,970
Wait, so I just became like a landlord

5600
05:22:40,970 --> 05:22:41,810
or like a hotel owner?

5601
05:22:41,810 --> 05:22:45,770
Yeah, you just became a regular landlord.

5602
05:22:45,770 --> 05:22:48,770
And then it shows your memory of us singing together.

5603
05:22:48,770 --> 05:22:50,490
Oh, God.

5604
05:22:50,490 --> 05:22:51,330
Oh, no.

5605
05:22:52,930 --> 05:22:53,849
That's awful.

5606
05:22:53,849 --> 05:22:55,330
He doesn't even use magic anymore.

5607
05:22:55,330 --> 05:22:56,290
I don't, yeah.

5608
05:22:56,290 --> 05:23:01,360
Oh, that's, well, am I making money?

5609
05:23:01,360 --> 05:23:03,599
The thing is, I had like plus 40 to Lona.

5610
05:23:03,599 --> 05:23:09,459
So I don't even know how this happened.

5611
05:23:09,459 --> 05:23:12,060
Turned into a landlord Andy.

5612
05:23:12,060 --> 05:23:14,380
Odd boss dream of his own parcel research tower

5613
05:23:14,380 --> 05:23:15,500
had finally been fulfilled.

5614
05:23:15,500 --> 05:23:17,659
He kept it well stocked with flammable powders

5615
05:23:17,659 --> 05:23:18,979
and a couple of summoning circles.

5616
05:23:18,979 --> 05:23:20,259
Wait, one of the kids died.

5617
05:23:20,259 --> 05:23:21,220
Did we hear about that?

5618
05:23:21,220 --> 05:23:22,419
Yeah, your kid died.

5619
05:23:22,419 --> 05:23:23,259
Mine lived.

5620
05:23:23,259 --> 05:23:26,900
Oh, I tried to kill mine, but.

5621
05:23:26,900 --> 05:23:28,580
Dude, I was talking to your kid the whole time

5622
05:23:28,580 --> 05:23:29,740
as it was my kid.

5623
05:23:30,619 --> 05:23:31,860
I know, he kept calling you uncle

5624
05:23:31,860 --> 05:23:34,930
and you wouldn't catch on.

5625
05:23:34,970 --> 05:23:37,049
The Inon and Elongus could never fully abandon

5626
05:23:37,049 --> 05:23:38,209
their adventuring life.

5627
05:23:38,209 --> 05:23:39,689
While the danger had dimmed,

5628
05:23:39,689 --> 05:23:41,729
there were memories yet to be made.

5629
05:23:41,729 --> 05:23:44,250
All right, I do now grasp your reasoning

5630
05:23:44,250 --> 05:23:46,049
in bringing me here.

5631
05:23:46,049 --> 05:23:47,610
There's my brilliant boy.

5632
05:23:47,610 --> 05:23:51,979
I hope you don't mind bringing me Elmish wine.

5633
05:23:51,979 --> 05:23:53,970
Remember Thomas?

5634
05:23:53,970 --> 05:23:57,770
Yeah.

5635
05:23:57,770 --> 05:23:59,569
Whatever happened to him?

5636
05:23:59,569 --> 05:24:02,810
I'm sure he's onto something exciting and challenging.

5637
05:24:02,810 --> 05:24:04,290
He owns a hotel chain now.

5638
05:24:04,290 --> 05:24:06,889
There's 6,000 branches across the country.

5639
05:24:06,930 --> 05:24:10,549
He owns some B&Bs.

5640
05:24:10,549 --> 05:24:12,869
Elongus gathered as many of the company's stories

5641
05:24:12,869 --> 05:24:15,909
as he could and enlisted Ardbar to illustrate them.

5642
05:24:15,909 --> 05:24:18,349
Dude, your kid is working.

5643
05:24:18,349 --> 05:24:22,380
I guess they did have that many tentacles, didn't they?

5644
05:24:22,380 --> 05:24:24,759
What about, you don't wanna ask me about anything?

5645
05:24:24,759 --> 05:24:25,599
No.

5646
05:24:25,599 --> 05:24:26,439
About our adventure that we had?

5647
05:24:26,439 --> 05:24:27,560
We don't even know where you are, dude.

5648
05:24:27,560 --> 05:24:31,020
You're just like a fucking Airbnb.

5649
05:24:31,020 --> 05:24:31,979
By the way, whose memory is that?

5650
05:24:31,979 --> 05:24:34,369
Cause I look pissed.

5651
05:24:34,369 --> 05:24:35,970
You remember when we climbed this rock

5652
05:24:35,970 --> 05:24:37,169
and there was nothing on it?

5653
05:24:37,169 --> 05:24:38,009
Why am I in this room?

5654
05:24:38,250 --> 05:24:41,130
You would cheat on your husband on top of the rock?

5655
05:24:41,130 --> 05:24:43,330
Also, actually, I think this is the rock we climbed

5656
05:24:43,330 --> 05:24:44,729
that turned my face into the wolf,

5657
05:24:44,729 --> 05:24:48,700
but also my face is already a wolf.

5658
05:24:48,700 --> 05:24:52,169
Oh yeah, that one is.

5659
05:24:52,169 --> 05:24:53,169
Yeah, that's what we had.

5660
05:24:53,169 --> 05:24:56,450
Oh, weirdly enough, you had both of your lovers sparks

5661
05:24:56,450 --> 05:24:58,090
on a cliff side.

5662
05:24:58,090 --> 05:24:59,970
So that's just something that, okay, cool.

5663
05:24:59,970 --> 05:25:01,930
Yeah, we had a big rock there

5664
05:25:01,930 --> 05:25:04,250
and then you expressed your love to me.

5665
05:25:04,250 --> 05:25:05,889
And then another big rock shows up

5666
05:25:05,889 --> 05:25:07,290
and you express your love to somebody else.

5667
05:25:07,290 --> 05:25:08,130
What the fuck is going on here?

5668
05:25:08,130 --> 05:25:10,310
Are you saying I'm faking it?

5669
05:25:10,310 --> 05:25:11,430
We're saying that you're fickle.

5670
05:25:11,430 --> 05:25:12,709
If there's a rock involved,

5671
05:25:12,709 --> 05:25:14,110
you're likely to just make bad choices.

5672
05:25:14,110 --> 05:25:15,909
I'm just saying a large cliff face

5673
05:25:15,909 --> 05:25:18,590
apparently makes you want to like be lovers

5674
05:25:18,590 --> 05:25:19,869
with the person you're with.

5675
05:25:19,869 --> 05:25:21,189
All right, so we can choose that.

5676
05:25:21,189 --> 05:25:24,229
All right, Oddbar does not get Aldecan.

5677
05:25:24,229 --> 05:25:25,750
They do not get added to our legacies,

5678
05:25:25,750 --> 05:25:28,069
but the other three, they live on.

5679
05:25:30,689 --> 05:25:32,840
Choose one hero to promote.

5680
05:25:32,840 --> 05:25:33,680
Promote?

5681
05:25:33,680 --> 05:25:35,360
Select a hero and move on to the next legacy tier

5682
05:25:35,360 --> 05:25:36,599
and their new items, history and abilities

5683
05:25:36,599 --> 05:25:38,040
will go with them.

5684
05:25:38,040 --> 05:25:39,279
The higher a hero's legacy tier,

5685
05:25:39,279 --> 05:25:41,360
the more abilities the hero will come into game with.

5686
05:25:41,360 --> 05:25:42,919
Do people just die?

5687
05:25:42,919 --> 05:25:45,290
I think Thomas deserves it.

5688
05:25:45,290 --> 05:25:46,250
I think you just let-

5689
05:25:46,250 --> 05:25:49,810
Look, Thomas becomes a local legend if we promote him.

5690
05:25:49,810 --> 05:25:50,889
Oh.

5691
05:25:50,889 --> 05:25:53,099
Not just a folk hero.

5692
05:25:53,099 --> 05:25:55,099
I think we remain folk heroes

5693
05:25:55,099 --> 05:25:57,220
because we disappear into the folk legend,

5694
05:25:57,220 --> 05:25:58,619
but you actually stay around

5695
05:25:58,619 --> 05:26:00,459
and give people great rates on a room.

5696
05:26:00,459 --> 05:26:02,180
Okay, that sounds good to me.

5697
05:26:02,180 --> 05:26:05,540
Okay, elemental weapons have been unlocked.

5698
05:26:05,540 --> 05:26:07,580
I think this is all separate.

5699
05:26:07,580 --> 05:26:09,080
Oh, it is separate.

5700
05:26:09,080 --> 05:26:11,240
I chose to promote Thomas.

5701
05:26:11,240 --> 05:26:12,560
This character will never be used again.

5702
05:26:12,560 --> 05:26:13,479
He's dead to me.

5703
05:26:13,479 --> 05:26:14,680
The adventure is over.

5704
05:26:14,680 --> 05:26:16,080
Yeah.

5705
05:26:16,080 --> 05:26:17,680
He's like 68.

5706
05:26:17,680 --> 05:26:19,779
Oh, I see.

5707
05:26:20,619 --> 05:26:22,259
I'll promote him in my game.

5708
05:26:22,259 --> 05:26:24,580
Yeah, cool.

5709
05:26:24,580 --> 05:26:25,419
All right.

5710
05:26:25,419 --> 05:26:28,479
That's it, man.

5711
05:26:28,479 --> 05:26:29,680
Well, that was really cool.

5712
05:26:29,680 --> 05:26:32,849
That was the first campaign in Wildermyth.

5713
05:26:32,849 --> 05:26:37,000
How many are there?

5714
05:26:37,000 --> 05:26:40,520
There is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

5715
05:26:40,520 --> 05:26:43,639
nine, 10, 10 regular chapters.

5716
05:26:43,639 --> 05:26:45,119
And then there's a special multiplayer one

5717
05:26:45,119 --> 05:26:47,500
that takes his five player.

5718
05:26:47,500 --> 05:26:48,340
Wait, hold on.

5719
05:26:48,340 --> 05:26:50,779
That was just one campaign.

5720
05:26:50,779 --> 05:26:52,659
One of 11 campaigns.

5721
05:26:52,659 --> 05:26:53,659
Oh shit, okay.

5722
05:26:53,659 --> 05:26:55,139
And that's not including like,

5723
05:26:55,139 --> 05:26:57,580
I think there's also like, you can mod the game.

5724
05:26:57,580 --> 05:26:59,180
There's like modded campaigns and stuff.

5725
05:26:59,180 --> 05:27:00,139
I've seen that there's mods

5726
05:27:00,139 --> 05:27:02,180
that add like more different types

5727
05:27:02,180 --> 05:27:03,419
of conversation encounters.

5728
05:27:03,419 --> 05:27:06,180
There's a ton of mods that add like new storylines

5729
05:27:06,180 --> 05:27:07,979
and like things that can happen to you

5730
05:27:07,979 --> 05:27:09,779
and all kinds of stuff.

5731
05:27:09,779 --> 05:27:11,250
But that was really fun.

5732
05:27:11,250 --> 05:27:12,169
Yeah, it was fun, right?

5733
05:27:12,169 --> 05:27:13,310
It's cool.

5734
05:27:13,310 --> 05:27:15,950
It's just like an enjoyable, like fun experience.

5735
05:27:15,950 --> 05:27:17,150
You just kind of mess around.

5736
05:27:17,150 --> 05:27:17,990
That's fun.

5737
05:27:17,990 --> 05:27:19,520
Yeah.

5738
05:27:19,520 --> 05:27:22,200
If we played again, it would be completely different.

5739
05:27:22,200 --> 05:27:26,599
Like everything would be different, which is interesting.

5740
05:27:26,599 --> 05:27:28,400
Well, that was a blast.

5741
05:27:28,400 --> 05:27:30,240
Thanks for inviting me.

5742
05:27:30,240 --> 05:27:32,560
Yeah, thanks for putting it together, stuff.

5743
05:27:32,560 --> 05:27:33,959
Banger.

5744
05:27:35,040 --> 05:27:38,270
So who's playing Darktide tomorrow?

5745
05:27:38,270 --> 05:27:39,630
All of us. Hell yeah.

5746
05:27:39,630 --> 05:27:41,580
Of course.

5747
05:27:41,580 --> 05:27:43,659
I'm gonna be sponsored to play it.

5748
05:27:43,659 --> 05:27:45,439
Anybody wants to play?

5749
05:27:45,439 --> 05:27:47,360
Dude, if you need a guy, let me know.

5750
05:27:47,360 --> 05:27:49,110
I'll be playing.

5751
05:27:49,110 --> 05:27:51,169
Yeah, well, okay.

5752
05:27:51,169 --> 05:27:54,099
Cause I think there's like a big pool of people.

5753
05:27:54,139 --> 05:27:56,060
I have to get to one now.

5754
05:27:56,060 --> 05:27:57,069
Cool.

5755
05:27:57,069 --> 05:27:57,909
So I'm gonna love to leave you guys.

5756
05:27:57,909 --> 05:27:58,750
Wait, what's yours?

5757
05:27:58,750 --> 05:27:59,900
What's the sponsor?

5758
05:27:59,900 --> 05:28:01,830
Oh, I have to play wow.

5759
05:28:01,830 --> 05:28:04,680
Oh, okay.

5760
05:28:04,680 --> 05:28:05,520
Yeah.

5761
05:28:05,520 --> 05:28:06,360
All right.

5762
05:28:06,360 --> 05:28:08,599
So the excitement drained from your body.

5763
05:28:08,599 --> 05:28:09,439
Oh, wow.

5764
05:28:09,439 --> 05:28:11,470
Oh, cool.

5765
05:28:11,470 --> 05:28:14,389
That was a, that was like a little,

5766
05:28:14,389 --> 05:28:15,709
that was a little like.

5767
05:28:15,709 --> 05:28:17,069
You could have at least faked it, man.

5768
05:28:17,069 --> 05:28:17,950
It would have meant a lot to me

5769
05:28:17,950 --> 05:28:19,389
if you just could have faked it.

5770
05:28:19,389 --> 05:28:21,069
Yeah, that was like an, oh, wow.

5771
05:28:21,069 --> 05:28:21,909
Oh, okay.

5772
05:28:21,909 --> 05:28:22,909
Cool.

5773
05:28:22,909 --> 05:28:26,689
You're like, oh, okay.

5774
05:28:26,689 --> 05:28:28,090
That's actually cool though.

5775
05:28:28,090 --> 05:28:30,259
It's cool.

5776
05:28:30,259 --> 05:28:32,580
I appreciate the invite though, Stuart.

5777
05:28:32,580 --> 05:28:33,900
Yeah, we'll catch up tomorrow

5778
05:28:33,900 --> 05:28:34,939
cause I think me and Strippin

5779
05:28:34,939 --> 05:28:36,900
are probably gonna play Darktide like most of tomorrow.

5780
05:28:36,900 --> 05:28:39,500
Yeah, we'll play, we'll play some Darktide tomorrow.

5781
05:28:39,500 --> 05:28:40,990
Yeah, we should definitely play.

5782
05:28:40,990 --> 05:28:42,389
Yeah.

5783
05:28:42,389 --> 05:28:43,229
Okay, I'll see you then.

5784
05:28:43,229 --> 05:28:44,069
Thank you, Stu.

5785
05:28:44,069 --> 05:28:44,909
See you guys tomorrow.

5786
05:28:44,909 --> 05:28:45,750
It was a pleasure, Gemma.

5787
05:28:45,750 --> 05:28:46,590
No, it was great too.

5788
05:28:46,590 --> 05:28:50,779
I know we've played Darktide, but let's go.

5789
05:28:50,779 --> 05:28:51,619
Yeah.

5790
05:28:51,619 --> 05:28:52,819
All right, man.

5791
05:28:52,819 --> 05:28:53,659
See you guys tomorrow.

5792
05:28:53,659 --> 05:28:54,680
See you later.

5793
05:28:54,680 --> 05:28:56,979
Bye.

5794
05:28:56,979 --> 05:28:57,819
Yeah, more Darktide tomorrow.

5795
05:28:57,819 --> 05:28:59,060
I can't even talk.

5796
05:28:59,060 --> 05:29:01,869
More Darktide tomorrow.

5797
05:29:01,869 --> 05:29:06,860
It's gonna be sponsored, but that, I wonder.

5798
05:29:07,779 --> 05:29:10,630
Yeah, we'll probably just play Darktide tomorrow.

5799
05:29:10,630 --> 05:29:16,060
Darktide is the new Warhammer 40K co-op survival game.

5800
05:29:16,860 --> 05:29:19,740
It's fun.

5801
05:29:19,740 --> 05:29:22,439
Able to connect time out because the session ended.

5802
05:29:22,439 --> 05:29:23,279
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

5803
05:29:23,279 --> 05:29:25,720
I actually didn't know what to expect going into this.

5804
05:29:25,720 --> 05:29:27,159
It was sort of a stir.

5805
05:29:27,159 --> 05:29:28,799
It was just like, hey,

5806
05:29:28,799 --> 05:29:31,479
do you wanna play this procedurally generated

5807
05:29:31,479 --> 05:29:34,919
kind of RPG DND game that just makes random stuff happen?

5808
05:29:34,919 --> 05:29:37,439
And it's like, sure, why not?

5809
05:29:37,439 --> 05:29:39,479
Hope it was fun to watch.

5810
05:29:39,479 --> 05:29:43,580
It was fun to do.

5811
05:29:43,580 --> 05:29:45,060
You were lost the entire time.

5812
05:29:45,060 --> 05:29:45,900
Yeah.

5813
05:29:46,740 --> 05:29:48,709
I think that's part of it, though.

5814
05:29:48,709 --> 05:29:52,830
It was definitely funny, but I hope you enjoyed it.

5815
05:29:52,830 --> 05:29:57,470
Yeah, so tomorrow we're doing a Warhammer, Darktide,

5816
05:29:57,470 --> 05:30:02,500
and then the day after that, Austin Show and I,

5817
05:30:02,500 --> 05:30:07,080
I'm gonna be on Austin's stream, gonna be in a big,

5818
05:30:07,080 --> 05:30:09,979
we're gonna be doing a flight simulator.

5819
05:30:09,979 --> 05:30:12,619
I have no idea what to expect.

5820
05:30:12,619 --> 05:30:18,549
I am, I wanna say, hopefully prepared.

5821
05:30:18,549 --> 05:30:21,930
It's gonna be a pretty wild experience, so.

5822
05:30:21,930 --> 05:30:24,700
If you don't, obviously go follow Austin's channel.

5823
05:30:24,700 --> 05:30:27,939
It'll be on Austin Show's channel.

5824
05:30:27,939 --> 05:30:34,939
Looking forward to it, should be fun.

5825
05:30:34,939 --> 05:30:36,590
Bring sorcery back.

5826
05:30:36,590 --> 05:30:38,869
Yeah, I know, and I told you this before,

5827
05:30:38,869 --> 05:30:43,220
but I do like these.

5828
05:30:43,220 --> 05:30:46,000
I mean, this is, I wouldn't call this a chill stream,

5829
05:30:46,000 --> 05:30:50,520
but it kind of was.

5830
05:30:50,520 --> 05:30:52,819
We're gonna do way more chill streams,

5831
05:30:52,819 --> 05:30:53,740
where we just kind of play something

5832
05:30:53,740 --> 05:30:57,819
and just hang out.

5833
05:30:57,819 --> 05:31:00,900
Breath of the Wild, yeah.

5834
05:31:00,900 --> 05:31:03,990
This was more chill than Miku Picross.

5835
05:31:03,990 --> 05:31:05,189
I think there was a,

5836
05:31:05,189 --> 05:31:07,470
I would say this was a little high energy at some points,

5837
05:31:07,470 --> 05:31:10,319
but it was just kind of playing, it was fun.

5838
05:31:10,319 --> 05:31:13,819
But that's it, I will see you guys later.

5839
05:31:13,819 --> 05:31:15,220
Have a good rest of your night.

5840
05:31:15,819 --> 05:31:20,490
Yeah, that's a perfect place to call it here.

5841
05:31:20,490 --> 05:31:24,720
Thanks for watching, everybody.

5842
05:31:24,720 --> 05:31:34,259
That was Wilder Myth.

5843
05:31:34,259 --> 05:31:36,139
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

5844
05:31:36,139 --> 05:31:40,459
See you tomorrow.

5845
05:31:40,459 --> 05:31:48,599
Thanks for supporting the stream, always.

5846
05:31:48,599 --> 05:31:54,090
You know Otto?

5847
05:31:54,090 --> 05:32:00,500
You'll see Otto soon.

5848
05:32:00,500 --> 05:32:03,939
But yeah, Darktide tomorrow, probably starting around,

5849
05:32:03,939 --> 05:32:05,340
what time?

5850
05:32:05,340 --> 05:32:06,340
That's a good question.

5851
05:32:06,340 --> 05:32:14,490
Not as early as this started, but not super late.

5852
05:32:14,490 --> 05:32:20,430
When, let me see, when should it be?

5853
05:32:20,430 --> 05:32:21,549
I don't know, maybe it'll probably,

5854
05:32:21,549 --> 05:32:27,220
I wanna play a little bit later in the evening, maybe.

5855
05:32:27,220 --> 05:32:30,020
Maybe start around, I don't know,

5856
05:32:30,020 --> 05:32:30,860
just keep an eye on Sus.

5857
05:32:30,860 --> 05:32:32,299
I don't wanna start too late.

5858
05:32:32,299 --> 05:32:35,720
Maybe like two, maybe two, three.

5859
05:32:35,720 --> 05:32:39,540
Let's just say three.

5860
05:32:39,540 --> 05:32:42,139
And I'm gonna try to make it for two.

5861
05:32:42,139 --> 05:32:45,419
I also don't want to have it be too late

5862
05:32:45,419 --> 05:32:49,740
because I wanna miss the 7.30 internet crash

5863
05:32:49,740 --> 05:32:54,139
that usually happens.

5864
05:32:54,139 --> 05:32:56,340
So that sounds like a good time to start.

5865
05:32:56,340 --> 05:33:02,259
Two, three o'clock, specific obviously.

5866
05:33:02,259 --> 05:33:04,250
Yeah, take care of yourselves.

5867
05:33:04,250 --> 05:33:05,490
Thanks for watching.

5868
05:33:05,490 --> 05:33:10,259
Thanks to, you know, thanks to the boys.

5869
05:33:10,259 --> 05:33:16,220
We'll see them tomorrow.

5870
05:33:16,220 --> 05:33:17,950
Take care of yourselves.

5871
05:33:17,950 --> 05:33:20,689
Good night, goodbye.

5872
05:33:20,689 --> 05:33:25,700
As always, call your mother, you know.

5873
05:33:25,700 --> 05:33:26,540
See you tomorrow.
