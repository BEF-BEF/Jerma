1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,750
Hold on, wait a minute. Maximum Action won the poll? When did that happen?

2
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,519
I... there has to be some type of... no, there's got to be some type of

3
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:35,619
coordinated effort here. Because Maxim... Fishing Planet. It's already open. I'm gonna play it. It's

4
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:49,049
already open. I've already installed it. Well then just uninstall it. That uses data.

5
00:00:51,189 --> 00:01:13,209
I've seen a lot of people talking about this title. It's very simple. Yep. That's it. Yep.

6
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:19,959
Somebody voting over and over again. Well, the poll is still open. Looks like Fishing Planet seems

7
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:26,760
to have crawled over with 42% of the vote. Well, it's okay because like all these kinds of games,

8
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,519
I'm either going to think this is really cool and play it for six hours or I'm going to immediately,

9
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:41,530
within 20 minutes, change to something else. We'll find out. What's the link? Here. Anyways,

10
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:55,799
how you guys doing? Here's the poll. I've already got it open. Like the election's over.

11
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,510
You know, I'm not going to get like sworn in and all of a sudden it's just like,

12
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:16,979
wait a minute, but what about Jupiter? You want to recount? Here it is. Millions of votes cast

13
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,229
for Fishing Planet. Actually, what really happened... I'm going to give you guys a breakdown

14
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,629
of exactly what happened here. I sometimes... Well, not sometimes. Every time. Because when

15
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,229
I'm setting up a stream, I come in and I'm doing scenes on OBS. I'm making sure the game is captured

16
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,110
correctly. I usually sit here for about 30, 40 minutes before a stream. I'll go eat. I'll come

17
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,469
back. I'll go to the bathroom. Whatever. The first message that I saw when I sat down into the pre-stream

18
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:51,349
chat was, wake me when he starts playing Fishing Planet. And I said, okay, wake up. Like I'm going

19
00:02:51,349 --> 00:03:05,189
to do it. I won guide the one guy. And I thought that was funny. And then I put it on the poll

20
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:21,900
and people voted for it. One guy. Wake up. It doesn't matter. It's already open.

21
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,379
Hey, he didn't even know. This is... It's this person's birthday today.

22
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:33,189
You didn't know that. It's happy birthday to this person. Here's your birthday present.

23
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:47,900
It's already open. Thank you. There he is. It's a special birthday present.

24
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,620
Anyways, Maximum Action is the other game that I have. So whether that's today, if that, you know...

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,979
No, I'm not sure. Quit. Maximum Action is the other game. So if I played this for like all day,

26
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:13,939
then whatever. We'll play it tomorrow. Right? This is Fishing Planet. This is going to be a relaxing

27
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:24,759
day. Hit enter. No. Approach the shoreline. I was ready for this. Make your first cast. Aim at the

28
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,680
ring. Click... By the way, this is an MMO. People didn't know that one before they came in.

29
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,160
Talking shit. All right. So just... What do you mean aim in the circle? Aim at the ring.

30
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:47,509
Okay. And that was not really a cast. I kind of just dropped it in there. Hold left mouse button.

31
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,360
Oh, I have to hold it. Okay. What am I doing wrong?

32
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,420
It's funny because this is the kind of shit that I would do if I went fishing. I never go fishing,

33
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,029
but I don't know what to do. I always found fishing to be just like a strange thing. You

34
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:26,709
throw this little wire into the ocean or into a lake and you hope that somebody walks by and bites

35
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:37,500
it? I don't think I could... No. I'll tell you, I think fishing is going to go away with the iPad

36
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,220
generation. Because within five minutes an ad didn't pop up for me to click on, like warning

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,660
me about the weather in my area. You think Zoomers are going to be able to handle this?

38
00:05:49,220 --> 00:06:20,870
Playing their like iPad game? Oh, yeah. Right. F11. Right. Okay. I gotta wait for fish to bite.

39
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,680
This is what we're doing. I got bread on there. What kind of bread? Bread. I don't see. I don't

40
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:40,519
see bread. Click right mouse. All right. Watch that line tension. How do I... What do I do? Real?

41
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:55,000
There's no more instructions. Go get them? How do I reel? I'm holding down left mouse button.

42
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,819
What's reel? What if I just walk backwards?

43
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:20,920
Pick it up. It's right there. Just pick it up. I swear to God. I'm like slingshotting him around.

44
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:43,699
I just want to pick him up. What am I doing? I can't reel him in. Is he still on it? How do

45
00:07:43,699 --> 00:08:01,050
you reel this in? I think I'm stuck on a tree. I'm tying myself up. Imagine walking by this poor

46
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,410
sucker. He's like... It's like a dog leash. Like I went to the dog park. Oh, no, no. You're just

47
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,209
going to me. I'll go under you and... It's like seeing another person with a dog. Except it's just

48
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:21,180
me. Try to reel it in. I don't know how to fucking do this. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not yet. Reeling

49
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:35,529
speed. Turn move rod. Where... Reeling speed. Where's reel it in? Hold right click. That just

50
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:44,519
holds it in the air. The fish is still on that. No, he's going back in. No, I can't... He's... I

51
00:08:44,519 --> 00:09:00,919
can't let him back in the water. He's gonna make it. Are you fucking serious? There's like bugs on

52
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:26,059
me. Get over... I can't, dude. I'm fucking... I think I'm done. I can't reel it in. Right and left click.

53
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,840
All right. Do I need to turn the webcam on to prove to you guys that I'm pressing left click?

54
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,750
Pitch cast reel on. Pull strike aimed cast. Reeling speed. Turn move rod. It's a bug. Snap

55
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,259
the line. Line break is B. All right. Well, let me bring him over here. Can I like pick him up?

56
00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:06,299
Where is he from here? Where is he from here? Come on. Just break the line. Line break. B.

57
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:26,679
B. I think I have to restart the game. B. Line break is B, right? Maybe like one, two?

58
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:37,850
How do I get the line to snap? Hold right mouse button. Yes. And then hold left click. I just...

59
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:55,350
I don't have like a dummy mouse that I'm pressing. I am doing the... I don't have two... Listen.

60
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:39,620
What the fuck? I... Let's try it again. Is it capturing? Can you see it? Harder than actual...

61
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:51,210
No, I ran into a bug. Okay. Now I thought I had music for a second. Approach the shoreline.

62
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:00,860
Shoreline approached. Make your first cast. Aim at the ring. Click left mouse button. Got it. Okay.

63
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:22,740
Wait for fish to bite. This might take a while. Is that one right there? Click right mouse button.

64
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,019
Got it. Reeling to... Hold left... This wasn't happening before. I swear to God that wasn't

65
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:41,029
happening before. I told you. It took so fucking long. All right. Got 4 XP to this confetti coming

66
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:49,240
down. All right. Make a few casts and catch some fish. All right. Now I'm excited. Now I'm into

67
00:12:49,240 --> 00:13:07,419
this. Why is this an MMO? I have no idea. How can I tell when there's a bite? Is it just bob?

68
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:25,220
That's what that means, right? All right. Is it too shallow? You can't... I can't walk around,

69
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:44,759
right? That scares the fish. You have to stand completely still. You can't talk either. You can't

70
00:13:44,759 --> 00:14:03,480
like move your mouth. See? Told you. That wasn't somebody on the line? I'm gonna go over here.

71
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:19,720
Too early? How is that too early? Your... Your viewer count is dropping. Quick. Do a face cam.

72
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,190
Oh, the viewer count is fucking rising. 7.4 inches. Release it. All right. Let's get another one.

73
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:50,649
Too early. Too early. Too early. Wait. Wait. Wait. Was there one on there? Right there?

74
00:14:51,370 --> 00:15:03,269
Ooh. That's a big one. 8.6. Time for a real catch. Ooh. Open inventory and change your bait for a

75
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:16,899
bigger fish. Uh, drag and drop to set red worms as bait. Crappy bluegill pumpkin seed. All right.

76
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,620
We're putting worms on here now. Now let's go to the local shop and get a fish keeper.

77
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:33,820
Choose tools and equipment. Buy a fish keep net to keep your catch. How much is 150 bucks?

78
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,470
Seems like a lot. We're all set here. Open the lake map. For bigger fish, prefer a good hiding

79
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:48,230
place. So let's select a different fishing spot. All right. What is this? Homes is my house. I have

80
00:15:48,230 --> 00:16:09,340
a basic business license. Okay. I'm ready. This is an actual iPad game. I know. All right. Here we go.

81
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:24,679
Float is on the side because the bait hit the bottom. Reel the bait back in. How far? Decreased

82
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:44,659
the line leader to 19. Use the zero button. What? Oh, line leader change to 19. All right. So I

83
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:49,460
have no idea what that means. That's like fish talk. I don't know what it means. That means how

84
00:16:49,460 --> 00:17:22,950
much line I give. Is that too early? I think it was too early. Pop one. What is it? Oh, it's a big

85
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:33,480
mouth bash. It's a crappy. Should I keep it? It's 13 inches. Keep. Level up. I've got 1500 bucks. I

86
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,440
got a new pond. I got a dart, a net, and two. You guys are gonna have to help me out here with this

87
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:49,400
shit. Callisto. That's a head. Hook six crimson cold water golden. I don't know what any of these mean.

88
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:59,660
Open the lake map to continue your adventure. You know what I need to have happen? I have to get

89
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,740
I don't know. I'm gonna have to hook it up to a button on here. I think I want a song to play

90
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,500
when I catch a fish like while it's on the reel. Okay. You can leave the lake now and go

91
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:25,819
home like a real winner. Okay. Result in rewards. So where are the other players? Challenge

92
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,900
complete. Complete the tutorial. All right. So where are we going? Where are we dropping?

93
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,650
Huh? What do you guys think? That's this. How many people are here? There's four people here.

94
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:49,690
These servers are the I don't know how this is supposed to be. Hold on. Did I actually just say

95
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,450
where are we dropping? And it automatically is a bad Fortnite joke when I actually just was asking

96
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:11,980
where are we going? All right. Um let's go to the lone star lake mud water river. How much is this

97
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:29,269
to unlock? For six coins. How many? I only have two coins. Where should I go? Go to Alaska? I need

98
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:41,619
$10,000 to go here. I don't have that kind of money. Don't have any missions. These numbers are

99
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:54,380
levels. Oh. So what? Just go back to my lake? It's been like 10 days since my prime sum ended and I

100
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:01,940
keep forgetting to resub. I'm sorry. Why did I read that? Don't you don't have to be sorry

101
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,819
that you didn't resub. All right. What about this one? How much is to go here? Oh okay. We're going

102
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:14,500
to uh we're going to France or wherever this is. France? Yeah. Let's go. We're going to the check.

103
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:24,789
We're going to check. Here we go. One coin. Successful. Pond Lesney villa fishery unlocked.

104
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:32,059
Let's go. Travel. I have 4,400 bucks I can go. What do you mean travel cost? One day? Two days?

105
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:42,920
Three days? This is how long I'm allowed to be there? Five days. You have no fishing license

106
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,599
for this state. What do you mean fishing license? You have to have a license to fish? You do? In a

107
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,000
different place? Uh Lexi just gave 10 community subs. Thank you Lexi. That's a lot of subs.

108
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:06,359
10 community subs just came in. All right. Buy a license. Thank you Lexi. Basic check license.

109
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:14,309
One day. Three days. A week. A month. Unlimited. Advanced. What's the difference between an advanced

110
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:27,700
and a basic license? Common roach. Take no restrictions. Night catch is allowed. I'm doing

111
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,339
it. I'm gonna get an advanced license. One day. Oops. Okay. It's fine. We're gonna go there for

112
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:39,140
one day. Are these friend requests? Are they? I don't want to even like click on it. All right.

113
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:48,200
I got my business license. I'm going there. I'm gonna get. I'm going for one day. Find me. Okay.

114
00:21:49,400 --> 00:22:03,819
Hold on a minute. I'm going. Let's go. Okay. What do they like here? What do they like to eat here?

115
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,059
Fish species. Carp. What do you. What do you like? What do you. What are you into?

116
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:17,849
Preferred? Uh semolina balls. Corn. Peas. All right. We're going for this one. I need corn and peas

117
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:25,450
and pea dough. What is pea dough? Is that like cookie dough but peas? Okay. I'm gonna go for one

118
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:41,670
of these. Semolina balls. Feeder starter. What's in here? Red worms. Dough balls. Um I think I need

119
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:50,309
these. Dough ball fish bait. Uh it's pumpkin seed. Uh this must be the starter bundle.

120
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:59,660
What do I. Don't I have something right now? I got like a new thing, didn't I? Bread worms.

121
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,789
I'm just gonna go in. There's at least a few people here that like worms.

122
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:23,289
Uh oh. I unlocked it to buy. Okay. I get it. Buy beef jerky and bud lights. There's somebody here.

123
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:53,160
Somebody's waiting for me. This is scary. All right. I need to follow. I need to follow along.

124
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:01,819
I need to be. They know the spots. Right here? What. Should we go in the same place? That's

125
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:09,559
probably not what we should do though. Somebody across the way. Oh there he is. There he is.

126
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,900
This person is the person that told me to play the game. This is the chat message. I remember.

127
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,500
Level 32. All right. You're gonna show. Gonna show me where to go. How do I get a mining helmet?

128
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:39,269
I'm just gonna. I'm going for it. This is my spot. Is there any bait on here? Yeah. This is worms.

129
00:24:45,049 --> 00:25:03,480
Oh really showing off here with like the really big cool pole. Got something? Shit. How do you

130
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:13,269
get in one of those outfits? All right. Watch out. Watch out. This is one of those scenarios. This is

131
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:26,470
how you go to get to the hospital. Hey. Watch the cast. This is how you end up like going backwards

132
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:51,109
and like grabbing somebody by like the fucking cheek. Easy. I think I'm stuck. All right.

133
00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:09,190
This is just scaring away all the fish. All right. Right here. I have bait still, right? Yeah. Worms.

134
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:27,690
I need to get something. All right. Shh. Don't you have to go really easy? Like gentle reeling?

135
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:41,130
I thought that's how you did it. How are you guys getting all these things? I need to get one.

136
00:26:41,130 --> 00:27:02,579
Am I stuck on the lily pads? I can't look. I can't move. Come on. Somebody. Something. Anything.

137
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:47,619
I'll take anything right now. Got it. European perch. That was weird. Let me see.

138
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,220
All right. I'll get a European perch. I'll keep it. All right. Now how much is left in the day?

139
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:11,210
Five a.m. Is this in real time? You guys thought I was going to take not enough time to do this.

140
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:21,430
All right. I'm going over here. How do we get um person that has 32 levels in this game? Do you

141
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:30,470
have a boat? Can we get on the boat? Can you can we go on a boat? I kind of want to see that.

142
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:41,049
Is it possible? I can't use boats here. Well can I borrow your license? I know that's not how it

143
00:28:41,049 --> 00:29:07,180
works but can I just borrow your license and go on your boat? That's a crime. It is a video game

144
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:14,339
though. This is a video game. There is no like add to friends, add to your business license.

145
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:28,980
I've got news for you guys. This is a fishing video game. You'll be lucky to catch one fish

146
00:29:28,980 --> 00:30:01,940
over the course of three full days. Not ten. How do I chat? What's the chat menu? Chat is tab.

147
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,500
I can't even go into the menu while the rod is stuck. I had that same problem earlier.

148
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,349
Did I? Did I ever tell you guys the story about how my brother got banned from Warcraft

149
00:30:51,990 --> 00:31:03,299
for like three days for writing in the trade chat? You know how people used to do this? They'd go

150
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:15,960
like oh hey we like wants to buy a um like uh 20 thorium bars right and they would put that in the

151
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,650
chat. That would be yeah like it's something we don't know. It'd be wants to buy like this 20x

152
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,890
thorium bars like please send help right and you'd be like oh okay that's what they want.

153
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:46,980
My brother got banned for three days in WoW for writing this. It was like what the fuck are you

154
00:31:46,980 --> 00:32:20,779
doing? I was like we were like 15, 16. They had to I didn't say it. Where's my line? Where am I stuck?

155
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:27,460
What? Who am I attached to somebody? Is that the person that's saying help?

156
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm not like attached to that person am I? Uh oh. Anyways Blizzard anytime you got in trouble in

157
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:45,180
WoW they had to tell you. They like he thought it was like the funniest thing that they had to

158
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,789
quote that to him like for the reason why he got like a suspension. I remember just being like

159
00:32:50,789 --> 00:33:21,000
you're a fucking idiot. How do I get this off? I don't know. There's 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. How far

160
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:41,990
does this go? 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54. What happens if we get to 216? What am I doing? Oh I'm I think

161
00:33:41,990 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm letting the line out. I gotta spell my name. I'm trying to make the E. It's not gonna work. No,

162
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:54,389
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What are you doing? People are just coming over here watching. You

163
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:04,420
run into the line. All right now. All right let's let's make it. That thing is huge. All right now

164
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:30,469
let's try to reel it up as fast as I can. Wait can I cast it? Lash all them up. All right let's

165
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:43,739
catch a fish. I still don't understand why where this is. It's stuck in there but how do I get it

166
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:51,739
out? Break the line. Are you sure you want to break the line? Yeah. Did I just break the line and

167
00:35:51,739 --> 00:36:00,780
hold on. Did I break my rod in half? Why would I do that? Oh it looks like my fishing line's broken.

168
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:20,539
May as well snap this thing over my knee. No I did not. Inventory. There's the okay I got line here.

169
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:28,789
Adjust the line length by like 140. There we go. Okay what's this? This is still on here. Where's

170
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:44,739
my rod? Hook. Okay I got a hook on there. Red worms. All right I'm ready to go. How do I equip

171
00:36:44,739 --> 00:37:08,679
a fishing rod? It's tough. That was a weak throw. It was fine. Let me reel it in a little video.

172
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:27,699
Excuse me. What if we all touch? This is probably giving actual people that fish in here anxiety.

173
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:53,980
I need a better f11. What did I just do? Holy fuck. Why is my instinct to turn and hit the

174
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:01,829
person next to me in the head with the rod? I don't know. All right let me get that again.

175
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:19,989
Nice. That was not even further than just tossing it out there. Catch some grasshoppers with your

176
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:28,409
hands. Oh what's that? All right come on now. Come on reel it in. Forget this. I want to see

177
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:45,000
what you get. You have like a shark on there. Easy now. Easy. Easy. What is it? Oh what? That's

178
00:38:45,000 --> 00:39:04,980
insane. All right Jeremy this ain't mini golf. Like let's go. Why am I only going that far? Zero

179
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:14,760
feet? Wait I saw. I know those are raindrops. Never mind. In every fishing game when you see

180
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,960
the little doop doop doop that means a fish is in like a fishing company's over there.

181
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:39,019
All right I'm just gonna leave it in. I'm not gonna move. I don't even like beer especially bud red

182
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,360
but I want to just drink a bud red right now. It's the only time you'll ever hurt. I will never say

183
00:39:44,360 --> 00:40:16,780
that out loud ever again except for right now this only instance. I want one of those but regular

184
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:41,750
Budweiser. Did I get it? Okay I actually did it. I ripped it out of the water. Guys guys come look.

185
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:50,099
Show and hide. Let me examine. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look what I got. Look what I got. Look

186
00:40:50,099 --> 00:41:00,860
what I got. Look what I got. Look at this. Look at mine. Look at my fish. All right release. Level

187
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:10,710
up. Cheese. Camo fest. I want the cheese. Can I? I just want to eat that cheese. I don't even want

188
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:24,619
to put it on the lure. Sinker. Barley. Chainsaw. What else is in here? I unlocked. I pretty much

189
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:59,590
unlocked the whole game. Go to the settings and enable big bobber. Big bobber. Big bobber. Oh I

190
00:41:59,590 --> 00:43:08,099
see what you mean. Now you can actually see what you're doing. Mod me. Give yourself an atomic

191
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:31,820
wedgie. Why do I feel like they did that on jackass at some point? I know I just said hurry up in a

192
00:43:31,820 --> 00:44:01,670
fishing game. Come on. Anything. What is that? Why is that a swear? You can buy the semolina

193
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:41,590
excuse you. What are you saying? Can you can you not write? Got one. I'll keep this one. You can't

194
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:54,889
write like ball. I need more line. I need I want to buy some cheese. Where are the big fish? Can you

195
00:44:54,889 --> 00:45:02,900
catch like huge things in this game? Where do we find the big ones? Throw at green not yellow.

196
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:19,539
Throw at green. What do you mean? Go to the ocean. Go in that house. Can we go in the biggest fish

197
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,820
there is? Biggest fish here is a carp and they get to like two pounds.

198
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:32,309
That sucks. I want to do like the I want to catch like the tuna. Those things are 13 pounds.

199
00:45:34,139 --> 00:46:22,219
Add a zero and another zero. Rude. Thanks. I think my fair part of both is wait a minute. That's a

200
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:30,139
splash. It's only one pound. That's actually pretty good. All right. This ain't gonna I get a cast

201
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:38,309
again. I need more line. I need more line. Give me some more line. Missions. Loan start to come

202
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:45,500
true. Loan start floor start to catch the listed fish in this lake. I'm in another country right

203
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,610
now so you're gonna have to wait a minute. I need the spin master. That's what I want. Where's the

204
00:46:51,610 --> 00:47:04,389
cheese? Bait. Cheese. Okay how much money do I have? I want a lot of cheese. I don't I'm it's

205
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:13,000
weird that oh there it is. I can't buy it. Why? I need to be like level 11 for a barley. We'll get

206
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:21,050
some of this. All right here we go. Looking for a bluegill. What have I got? I want a bluegill.

207
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:41,500
Now we also need a slingshot. What? Why do I need that? Lures. What's a good one? Gold. I'll take

208
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:57,750
the gold one. Ground baits? Hold on. These just bags of chips? All right I need reels. Okay this

209
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:07,000
is where it gets good. I can buy a mini spin 1200. Weight. Recovery. Look at this thing right here.

210
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:17,130
Check. A mini spin 1200 right? That's a better version of this. I don't even know what any of

211
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:26,650
this means but I'm just gonna get it. Why can I not equip it? Okay lions. I want some good shit.

212
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:36,539
Mono. Why is this more expensive? XXL. Length 300 yards. All right we'll get some.

213
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:49,719
500 yards. Okay. Mono leader. Floor row. No no that's in-game currency.

214
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:59,769
I'm just gonna get them. I don't know if they really do. Tackle. Hooks. Hook six. I have hook

215
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:10,280
eight. Oval. I need a good one. Chubby. Floating weight high. Shape chubby. Make it easy to see

216
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:17,420
at long distances. Anything from hand fish to salmon to steelhead. I guess it's just

217
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:24,780
aesthetically pleasing to get the chubby one. All right let's go. I already own this. All right

218
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:38,699
six. Hook six. Line. Mono 005. We'll take it at 139 feet I guess. Cheese. Looking for a bluegill.

219
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:50,260
What kind of hook do I got on there? All right where do I get a bluegill? Map. None of these

220
00:49:50,260 --> 00:50:02,360
bluegills. There's a goldfish too. All right not this way. No no no no no. Back up. What about

221
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:11,369
over here? Oh look at this. Carp. Roach. Perch. No I need a bluegill. Where can I get a bluegill?

222
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:31,380
What's my level three? They eat cheese? Who eats cheese here? Me and the common carp have the same

223
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:51,769
diet. Like in order of how often you consume them. Nobody wants cheese here. Cheese. Okay I'm

224
00:50:51,769 --> 00:51:01,880
leaving. I'm going home. Nobody here wants cheese. I have to leave. All right we're out. I'm gonna get

225
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:16,329
I'm gonna do one more attempt here. What's this one? No. Let's get one more fish. All right what

226
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:27,210
have I got for? I got cheese on here. Who? Anybody wants cheese? What's my favorite cheese? It really

227
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:34,309
depends on the scenario because there's a lot of different answers to that question. Swiss cheese

228
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:42,739
is the best on sandwiches. I think without a doubt. Asiago cheese is really good on pretty

229
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:46,019
much everything no matter what it is. Especially when it's baked onto something else into a crust.

230
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:52,409
I don't like brie. It reminds me throw up. It smells and tastes like puke. I don't like it.

231
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:05,050
Aguda. Blue cheese are both very good. And I don't trust any cheese where you can eat the rind.

232
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:12,179
Oh the brie. Have some brie. I don't want to eat the lemon rind. That shit's pretty much made out

233
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:40,099
of plastic. I don't want to eat it. Bavardi is good. Yeah. Do a cheese tier list. Of course that

234
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:48,170
exists. Do I like monster? I only like monster cheese when it's on a plate sliced into small

235
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:57,800
squares and there's a cracker right next to it. I don't eat it anywhere else. Blue cheese I would

236
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:04,280
I it's my favorite on anything. I would put blue cheese on anything and I'm not talking about blue

237
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,480
cheese crumble. I'm talking about the blue cheese sauce. Not blue cheese dressing. Get it right.

238
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:18,360
Oh blue cheese dressing. No no no no no. Blue cheese sauce. The thicker blue cheese. See people

239
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,800
always confuse this and when you sometimes when you go to a restaurant you get blue cheese. Oh

240
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,199
you want blue cheese. Yeah I'll take a side of blue cheese. Yeah I'll take blue cheese on that.

241
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:45,059
It's the blue cheese dressing that you put on a salad. No get that away from me. What is blue

242
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:51,219
cheese sauce? It's thicker as it has a thicker base. It can be dunked into with like chicken

243
00:53:51,219 --> 00:54:00,920
fingers especially buffalo chicken. Buffalo chicken tenders and that blue cheese thick

244
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:08,820
sauce. The thick dunkable blue cheese. Find me a better appetizer and I'll fucking say all right.

245
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:19,139
The biggest offense of any restaurant. I don't care who they are. I don't care what they specialize

246
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:24,739
in. I don't care what their star rating is. If you order blue cheese with a meal and they give you

247
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:38,539
a packet of blue cheese dressing on the side, do not ever go there again. I think my line's too

248
00:54:38,539 --> 00:55:05,369
long. There we go. This woman. Do you see this swarm? It's mold. Yeah and guys please. You're

249
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:13,340
eating mold. Do you know. Did you know that you eat over 12 inches of dirt every single meal? Did

250
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:24,650
you guys know that? Every single meal you eat over 12 at least 12 inches of dirt. Something I

251
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:32,730
I've been talking at least that much. Do I have a source on that? Yeah because you're eating about

252
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:57,590
12 inches at least off the ground. I got another one for you. Turn my mic back on. Why don't we

253
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:17,739
eat cheese here? Did you know you drank over 12 liters of monster energy a month? Um no don't do

254
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:37,449
that. That's like that's like an easy way to get a heart attack. Don't do that. Do a cheese tasting

255
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:44,619
stream. I'd like to do a catch a fish on game stream if I could do that. Here we go. Here we go.

256
00:56:44,619 --> 00:57:06,409
Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Got it. What is it? Oh it's a common roach. Release. How about uh

257
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:14,300
this game's actually like kind of fun. I'm not gonna. I saw at least 150 comments of people

258
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,500
saying why don't you play one of the good fishing games. This is this is all right. This is like a

259
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:44,179
not a bad one. The line's a little too long. Ban that guy for three days. No cheese. Cheese is good

260
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:56,019
but you can't eat cheese too often. It just turns into cement in your body. Got it. European

261
00:57:56,019 --> 00:58:21,460
perch. No. I want like a at least half pond. Can we go ice fishing in this game? You can?

262
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:41,780
That's actually kind of cool. Has anyone ever tried to make a fantasy fishing game?

263
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:50,710
No. People make a fantasy game and then put fishing in usually. We got a little bit of a bite there.

264
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:59,800
Unlock mud water river as soon as possible. Okay. There's big catfish there. Do they like cheese?

265
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:06,230
I'll tell you. You know what I do love? A restaurant that has a good. I'm gonna say

266
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:09,829
this wrong because I don't know the names of things. I just know what it is. I just know

267
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:14,869
when it comes in front of me. I just know what it is. Uh I'm gonna say it. I don't know.

268
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:33,780
I just point at it and I go oh I want that. I don't I know what it is. It's the board with

269
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:39,619
the the figs and the cheeses and the the prosciutto and the ham and the salami and the olives.

270
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:45,239
I love those things and when a restaurant does one of those good they oh that's all you need.

271
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:54,469
Just order one of those and just eat it. Uh chikurri board. Chikurri board. There it is.

272
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,039
Just eat raw meat off the plate. What do you mean raw meat? Prosciutto's not raw. Is prosciutto

273
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:23,159
raw meat? No it's not. Raw meat? Yeah it's cured. It's cured. It's not. They don't just like do an

274
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:40,710
ice cream scoop of like 80 20 grocery store ground beef. It's cured meat. Cured is raw.

275
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:48,900
No it's been cooked because it's been cured. It's it's salted to a point where it cooks it.

276
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,739
I don't know what that means. I told you. I just point to stuff at the menu.

277
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:16,099
I had it right. I asked it's salted to a point where bacteria can't. I know. I know and I said

278
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:21,860
it right but people go to question mark. They go like this. What does this guy just say?

279
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:38,460
It's salted to a point where it's been. Why am I not getting any bites?

280
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:53,059
Yeah I know curing meat doesn't cook the meat but I know. I'm just I'm listen to me. I'll take a

281
01:01:53,059 --> 01:02:15,050
chikurri board please with extra figs because they're delicious. You sound like an annoying me

282
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:30,039
with that voice. Which one? An annoying me? Me's don't talk. Do me's talk? I've never heard a me

283
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:40,039
talk before. The only closest thing I can think of is just when you hit okay on the menu with a me.

284
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:52,300
It just goes like they don't have a voice. Fortnite okay. Fortnite Jimmy just like screwed

285
01:02:52,300 --> 01:03:14,039
up that whole thing. I was seriously about to catch a fish right there. Watch it. Watch it.

286
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,719
What do you got? Let's see it. What do you got going here? I want to see. What do you got going

287
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:28,659
on here? You got something don't you? What is it? That's a that's pretty big. For a second I

288
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:40,309
thought that one pound almost a pound and a half. Nice. Kick that person so I can get in. I didn't

289
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:56,340
think there was that much demand for a fishing planet. Apparently there is. There's not. Here we

290
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:16,900
are. I would have had something here too. Uh-oh. Fortnite Jimmy 2010. Starting to show signs of

291
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:39,909
agitation. All caps. Come on something. I teach elementary all my kids love Fortnite.

292
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:49,210
Yeah it's Fortnite. You know whatever. I'm trying to think of the games that I liked

293
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:55,269
when I was younger. It's hard to compare though because we're in a different world.

294
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,949
We're in like a constant completely connected and somebody the same person has walked by my

295
01:05:00,949 --> 01:05:13,000
screen like 10 times. Am I going crazy? That was the same person right? Okay I'm just like I want

296
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:25,619
to know if I was freaking out or not. Yeah games have changed. We're constantly connected. Diablo

297
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:34,179
2 is probably that game for me. You can play that game online but it got to a point. You want to

298
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:40,780
know when Diablo 2 was ruined completely forever? When you would join a game and no matter what,

299
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:51,059
every 25 seconds a bot would enter the room and spam a buy items website. It happened thousands

300
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:55,139
of times if you joined a public server. That was the day when that started happening that

301
01:05:55,139 --> 01:06:09,829
the game was over. They would come in. Oh here it was. And they'd have a name like this. Like and

302
01:06:10,389 --> 01:06:17,269
okay here we go. And you'd get that and then they would get they would get like booted from the game.

303
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:30,300
They would just spam. It would be like you'd get that message sound in Diablo 2. They walked by

304
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:42,219
again. So you had to make private rooms. At that point it was hard to play the game online

305
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:52,300
unless you had specific people that could join a room with a password. Hold on. Finally. Finally

306
01:06:52,300 --> 01:07:03,429
it's been so long. I just caught it. Almost seven tenths of a pound. Whatever that denomination

307
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:15,099
is. Almost a pound. Seven almosts of a pound. Pretty good. Keeping that one. Chunky baloney

308
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:21,980
thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you Chunky. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a lot.

309
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,079
The last two days people have just been coming in with these huge community subs

310
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:33,400
and huge amounts of money. I see one right there. Thank you guys for real.

311
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:38,789
This is an outrage. Play the next game. We're just hanging out and talking.

312
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,739
I'm trying to give you guys the real fishing experience because what happens is when you

313
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:47,099
go fishing. I've been fishing a few times. Is let's say you go three or four people.

314
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:52,619
Two or three of those people want to just sit silently and just hang out.

315
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:57,739
While the other fourth person, which is me, does not stop talking and annoys everybody there.

316
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,940
Always bringing up new topics. Always bringing up things to discuss.

317
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:09,099
And I'm the fourth annoying guy. And then the other three in a private chat text on their phones

318
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:14,309
are talking about how we're not going to bring Jeremy next time. Like hey you want to go fishing

319
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:20,739
again? Yeah just like us. And they don't have to say anything. They don't say a word. They just

320
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:27,930
make the group chat without my number in it. That's it. That's their way of doing that. They don't go

321
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:34,279
oh that was annoying. No no no. They just make that group chat without me. And I'm like hey guys

322
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:40,119
you want to go fishing? Let's go fishing again. Yeah yeah no maybe. And then yeah maybe.

323
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:44,970
Weirdly now they say a certain line every time. They're like oh yeah we'll look into that. I'll

324
01:08:44,970 --> 01:09:04,329
look into that. I'm like oh look into that okay. Oh that's the biggest one yet. I got 44 dollars

325
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:16,489
for this one. Let's show this one off. This one's got this one's like thick here. Let's show it.

326
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:28,010
This is my keep net. All right I got a nine inch Russian carp. This one. I mean get rid of this one.

327
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:33,880
Can I sell them? Or does does releasing sell them? Or do I have to sell them in like a shop?

328
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:44,180
Because that one's not good enough. Keep this one. Buy a casting rod? Well I gotta get money first.

329
01:09:45,060 --> 01:10:00,890
But not fishing is. Okay that screwed that up. After you start the next day you'll sell them.

330
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:13,210
All right what time is it? 7 44 a.m. This is going to take a very long time. I can't believe I'm

331
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:16,890
spending my Tuesday afternoon playing a virtual fishing game with some old boomer.

332
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:31,220
Well believe it. Um I'm sorry let me I'm gonna level with me here. Tuesday afternoon it's just

333
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:35,859
like kind of right almost in the middle of the week. Weekday like that's not a problem. What's

334
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:42,340
wrong with that? You know it's like five o'clock pacific just hanging out. There's nothing wrong

335
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,579
with that. This is when you go fishing. You go fishing on like Tuesday afternoon at like

336
01:10:46,579 --> 01:11:14,279
four in the morning or like four or five o'clock at night. This is the time to do this. Hey guys

337
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:18,199
let's not bring Jeremy to the next fishing trip. He just won't fucking stop talking.

338
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,920
You got me. So what happens if you end the day early? Do I have enough money to end a day early?

339
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,520
Should I just go somewhere else? I need to find a fish that's at least worth selling that's worth

340
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:58,170
some money. Come on right here. You know sometimes you look over the chat. You look at you know

341
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:02,250
something that somebody in a community will and will say something along the lines of

342
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:11,239
Wow I like this stream a lot. I'd watch him paint a fence. You're being tested right now.

343
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:30,119
This is where I cut to a live camera of me with like a painter's outfit on and I got like a bucket

344
01:12:30,119 --> 01:13:03,340
of paint in my hand with a fence behind me. Now that would have been funny. Damn. Damn. He streams

345
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:11,140
twice every other week and decides to play this. You're not keeping up. That's not fair. That's

346
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:27,060
inaccurate. Inaccurate. It's an inaccurate statement. Do I actually do I know how to fish?

347
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't think you can know how to fish. I think it just happens. That means he doesn't.

348
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:31,800
You guys are fucking funny. Streams. Streams twice every other week. That's bullshit. Oh this one

349
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:46,149
sucks. If you go to a twitch stats website actually this is real data. I actually stream about

350
01:14:47,800 --> 01:15:01,319
15 to 16 times a month. Probably like 17. 15 to 17 times a month is my accurate stats on twitch.

351
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:06,279
That means that means statistically there's a stream every other day. Statistically speaking.

352
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:12,890
Three days in a row. Two days off. Two days in a row. Three days off. Three days in a row. Three

353
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:25,460
days off. That's kind of how it happens. Every other week. No that's not that's that would mean

354
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:30,739
that I would stream seven days in a row. All right you know what they're correct. You're right.

355
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:37,060
You are correct. That is accurate. That means week one I don't stream for seven straight days.

356
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:45,369
Week two I stream seven days in a row. Week three zero. Seven days straight of no streams. Week

357
01:15:45,369 --> 01:16:07,619
four seven straight days of stream. That's inaccurate though. That's misleading. My brother

358
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:14,920
typed that. Every day for a year and then don't stream for a year. Yeah I'm an every other year

359
01:16:14,920 --> 01:17:06,489
streamer. You know I love board chat. It's kind of it's one of my favorite chats. Wiggle the poll.

360
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:14,789
That doesn't do anything. Board chat board chat does get bad real fast you're right.

361
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:41,739
Just wait till I go get a catfish and everybody pug champs and you forget. Still waiting for your

362
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:53,560
opinion on French cuisine. Why would I do this when I can fish in real life. I'm not sure if

363
01:17:53,560 --> 01:18:20,699
you know this but I live in the desert. This is all I can do. Fish for sand worms. Go fish in the

364
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:30,409
Hoover Dam. You guys were giving me shit earlier about me not having a business license to go to

365
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:45,699
Czech Republic to get a fish and now you're telling me to go fish in the Hoover Dam. Go fishing.

366
01:18:45,699 --> 01:18:51,699
I wasn't even paying attention. That's what happens. Everybody falls asleep. I wonder how

367
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:58,260
many opportunities are missed to fish because three or four people go to bed in lounge chairs

368
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:22,090
and all their fishing poles are like shaking around and they don't even do it. Oh let me up.

369
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:36,359
Let me help this guy out. Holy shit. Wow. Great minds think alike. See now that person's gonna

370
01:19:36,359 --> 01:20:02,470
think that's real. There's a lot of smiley faces here. There's this smiley faces here. There's like

371
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:56,699
I gotta correct this. There's too many. There's like happy smiling faces. What's wrong with that?

372
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:04,170
The drake sword sucks. The drake sword is the best early game weapon you can possibly use in that

373
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:11,880
game. Just get it and use it without even upgrading it for like fucking 12 hours. The drake sword is

374
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,819
for idiots. We're not talking about like intelligence levels. We're talking about like how to make the

375
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:42,569
game easier for you. I lost my one opportunity. This guy probably likes TF2 more than the classic

376
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:58,760
game Overwatch. Yeah I do. Whatever. I want to get on a boat. All right. How much money do I have?

377
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:05,300
There's not a fish on the line right now. If there is I'm gonna laugh my ass off. Nice. I got lied

378
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:28,010
to and I could have probably sat there. And I'm going over here. Get a jet ski. Get a jet ski and

379
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:43,029
drive like really fast and turn, pull, brake and like spray everybody. Get to level four for the

380
01:22:43,029 --> 01:22:52,859
next area. Am I there now? Level two? What level am I? I have to type to know. Level three.

381
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:17,380
Give me something. Can you wake me up in 30 minutes? Yes. Lewis Cheese. In 30 minutes I'm

382
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:27,239
gonna fucking call out your name. Exactly 30 minutes from right now. That'd be one hour and

383
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:43,779
54 minutes stream time. Gonna forget? No I won't. Yes you will. I will not forget that. What's his

384
01:23:43,779 --> 01:24:08,069
name? Lewis Cheese. Didn't forget. Go to bed. See you in 30 minutes. Is there even bait on this?

385
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:15,619
I have french toast sticks in the oven. Wake me up in five minutes so I can flip them over. Don't

386
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:34,470
turn the oven on and go to bed. What do you got? Do you mind? All right. That's something's got to

387
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:44,010
change here. This is not working out. I need a bread. I'm gonna try bread. Worms aren't working

388
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:52,010
right now. Try to get a crappie with these. Crappie. Where's my other? There it is.

389
01:24:53,289 --> 01:25:10,470
Slop spoon. I can't use that here. It's time for fun boat time. Not yet. I'm going over here.

390
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:25,960
I need to get to level four so I can go to the next area. Beer powers up your fishing rod.

391
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:38,439
How does it? Wow. You gotta buy the brackets quote funny line. It's right there.

392
01:25:39,399 --> 01:26:06,250
How do I wall run? All right, Jimmy. Jimmy. Drink monster. Drink bite monster. No, why would I do

393
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:20,500
that? If I drink like a monster, I just get heartburn. This, okay, I'm just going to give

394
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:25,380
you some anecdotal evidence here. Just anecdotally, whenever I drink an energy drink,

395
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:32,840
I get heartburn and my eyes hurt. I just don't, I'm not going to drink one of those.

396
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:55,560
All of them across the board pretty much do this. Too much energy from my

397
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:03,189
body. No. God, you should just, you should be eating fucking vegetables and fruits and shit.

398
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:21,930
How many times do we have to have this conversation? Eat a banana. Pretty good. Keep it.

399
01:27:26,869 --> 01:27:40,569
Yes. Mud river. Mud river. Let's go. Sayonara. It's time to go to mud river. How much money did

400
01:27:40,569 --> 01:27:50,140
I get? 105 bucks and not premium. Premium. Does that have to buy it or something? Sorry, Jimmy.

401
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,939
Day two. I didn't, let me day two. This is the first time I've ever played this game. All right.

402
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:09,779
Where's that mud river? There it is. Let me get a license for it. 1200 bucks to be here. Whatever.

403
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:15,909
Uh, advanced license. No restrictions. I don't want any violation of license

404
01:28:15,909 --> 01:28:26,149
rules. There's nothing fine. One day advanced license. All right. Let's go.

405
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:46,939
One day. Let's go. Mud river. Catfish heaven. Pike challenge lost. It's not catfish heaven.

406
01:28:51,300 --> 01:29:02,069
These are big. Enjoy exploring mud water river and its premises for a certain number of days.

407
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:21,260
I don't stop advertising to me. What's this? Nice. All right. What's up? So what's what if

408
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:30,460
what fishes are here? Fish species. We've got catfish. They like marshmallow, pet food, leeches,

409
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:36,460
and okay marshmallows. Dough balls. I don't have any of those. Dough balls. I gotta buy some bait

410
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:47,979
here. Blood worms. I need marshmallows. All right. Marshmallows and pet food. How much are

411
01:29:47,979 --> 01:30:03,899
marshmallows? Did I unlock marshmallows yet? I can't even get marshmallows. How much is both?

412
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:18,899
But there is pet food. Okay. The buy the balls. I can't have to be level 11.

413
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:31,699
All right. So let's get the pet food on here. Do I? Okay. Do I need a certain line or something

414
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:54,310
or a certain hook for this 150 length long line short line hook six. Okay. Let's see. Let's go.

415
01:30:56,470 --> 01:31:11,479
Got my line here. What is my lead? 18, 25, 30 inches. That sounds about right. No, no, no, no,

416
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:14,680
no, no, no, no. That's not right. I got pet food on there though. No, no, no. I gotta throw it.

417
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:41,539
F11. One and a half pound catfish. Nice. Nice dude. Right here. Here we go. Hey there, new to the

418
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:45,220
streams anyways. Do you think you could do a dab at some point? It's no pressure. It's just my

419
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:51,880
it's red on my screen. So I have to read them. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Come on.

420
01:31:51,880 --> 01:32:01,500
Strike it. Strike. Come on. Get on there. I know you want to get on that. You showed interest for

421
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:30,439
a second. Come on. I had it. There it is. There it is. There it is. Oh, easy. Easy. Pumpkin seed.

422
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:43,460
12 bucks. No, get out of here. I want to go to another spot. You want to how you make this game

423
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,819
insane and have everybody talk about it and just be like, Oh, you have to play it.

424
01:32:47,619 --> 01:32:51,619
Have like a werewolf jump out of here. Jump scare the fuck out of you. And then you put like your

425
01:32:51,619 --> 01:32:54,899
rod, you flip it upside down and it becomes a weapon. And it's a first person fucking like

426
01:32:54,899 --> 01:33:17,239
fantasy fighting game. Entirely different game. No, just for this one spot. You know how many

427
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:22,789
Buzzfeed articles will be written on your game. You can have this fishing game being completely

428
01:33:22,789 --> 01:33:40,060
normal. Everyone would just camp that spot. Yeah. Make it like a 0.2% chance to happen.

429
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:51,720
I should pee. Peeing in the river helps attract fish. I feel like that's weird enough to be true.

430
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:21,850
Interest. Interesting. It might already be in there and nobody's done it enough to trigger

431
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:36,069
the warning. It's possible. It's true. Fish smell the ammonia in urine. See the first person that

432
01:34:36,069 --> 01:34:40,229
said that it was weird enough to be true. That second comment was just specific enough to be

433
01:34:40,229 --> 01:35:15,960
false. Somebody bite this. Try again. This way. When am I going to close this game and stream

434
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:24,069
Just Dance 4? I'll give you a spoiler for one of the 37 Connect games that I have. You want

435
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:36,420
to get spoiled on one of them? I'll do it. I'm going to, I'm just going to show a flash on cam.

436
01:35:37,140 --> 01:36:19,340
You ready? Hope you guys can catch it. How's fishing going? Pretty good. I've done nothing bad.

437
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:34,760
Somebody's on it. Come on. Somebody's looking at it. I want a catfish. Please

438
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:44,729
catch a fish. Dumbass. That's not how this works. You could be the best fishermen in the world

439
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:55,399
and they'll fish just don't want to bite today. I am solely reliant on another party to be able

440
01:36:55,399 --> 01:37:09,300
to be good at this. What do you mean false? Sometimes the fishes don't want to bite today.

441
01:37:09,939 --> 01:37:17,560
You could do all kinds of like little tricks like this. Like turn, turn, turn, turn, twist,

442
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:20,279
turn, turn, turn, turn, twist. Everybody has their own little thing they do. Right?

443
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,090
But the fish isn't hungry. They're not going to bite you. It's not going to work.

444
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:36,500
Different spot. Yeah, this spot sucks. Watch out for the fucking werewolf. You're not going to find

445
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:58,439
a catfish here. Just go on tinder. 10 out of 10 joke. I didn't make it. I was responding to it.

446
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:18,710
I was reacting. React more. There's still pet food on here. Right? Yeah. Nice and easy. Just quick.

447
01:38:19,829 --> 01:38:26,420
Just to show that I'm moving around and see on the left side, left side of the screen.

448
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:43,720
Did you see that? Oh, somebody get it. Get it. It's right there. You're right here. I want you

449
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:59,380
to grab it. Just get it. Almost there. Please. Just pull it down. Got him. Now that's a big one.

450
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:11,819
13.3 inches over a pound. I wish you could walk in the water. Just walk in there and show.

451
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:17,500
That's big. All right. That one's money. We'll have some money for that.

452
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:25,020
It's too bad catfish taste like ass. I have to say, I don't think I've ever had it before.

453
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:45,590
I don't think I've ever eaten catfish. Let's just relax here. Oops. No, I don't want to open the

454
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:55,560
menu. I don't want to open the menu. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here it comes. Here it comes.

455
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:07,560
Somebody coming. Somebody coming. Timed out. What? It didn't even move. It was just barely

456
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:23,579
bobbing a little. That's annoying. Catfish eat mostly just shit stuff, so they taste like shit.

457
01:40:27,699 --> 01:40:47,159
Hold on. It's still here. Come on. What is it? That's even bigger. 1.2 pounds. Almost 13.7 inches.

458
01:40:52,899 --> 01:41:03,750
Larry, keep it. Nice. Okay. This spot actually is pretty good. Let me check this spot over here.

459
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:15,289
Is there another spot besides this way? Can I go this way? Like to the left? What the fuck was that?

460
01:41:15,289 --> 01:41:28,920
What the fuck? What? What the fuck? How do I take the weapon out? How do I take out the weapon?

461
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:56,810
Let's go motherfucker. I'm ready. Is it gone? So I've never had it before. Catfish is one of

462
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:00,409
those things that I feel like it's at a ton of restaurants, but not at any restaurants.

463
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:08,470
It's weird. I see it on menus and I'm like, oh, they have fucking catfish here all the time,

464
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:19,930
but then when I want to try it, it's never there. You have to cook it really carefully.

465
01:42:22,979 --> 01:42:43,130
I scared your cat. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare your cat. You scared me.

466
01:42:44,489 --> 01:42:48,890
But why the fuck would they put that in this game? That's not fucking cool. That's stupid.

467
01:42:50,619 --> 01:42:54,699
Why would you ever put that in a game and scare the shit out of everybody that plays it?

468
01:42:54,699 --> 01:43:00,979
What a bad idea. It's supposed to be a relaxing fishing game and you're gonna have like a werewolf

469
01:43:00,979 --> 01:43:28,039
jump out and scream. That's kind of like, that's not a good idea. I can't wait for the next five

470
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:36,899
sound effects. That's what this is. The funny sound effect. I can't wait for the funny sound,

471
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:38,979
the next funny sound effect. Me either.

472
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:02,819
Stop. You're going to lose all your plus twos. Watch out. Watch it. It's going to happen again.

473
01:44:10,359 --> 01:44:39,239
They're already gone. Market manipulation at its finest. This was a much better spot,

474
01:44:39,239 --> 01:45:01,380
though. It actually was. Come on. Somebody's freaking out over there. Yeah. It's all right.

475
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:11,029
They're probably lagging. Fight it. It's right there. Talk to the guy across the river. Would

476
01:45:11,029 --> 01:45:17,880
you do something like that? Are you serious? The thing bopped all the way down. If you were fishing,

477
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:22,359
if you're the only person here and that person was fishing and you were fishing and you were sitting

478
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:26,659
there for like an hour or two straight, eventually, don't you think you would be,

479
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:35,289
you'd say like, catch anything or something like that, just to lighten up the mood or something.

480
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:53,960
I feel like somebody would do that. No, not as big as the other one, but still all right.

481
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:03,340
Yeah. You wouldn't yell over there. Hey, did you see the werewolf put a boombox like in the

482
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:07,979
bush over here, hit play and run back over here. That's the equivalent of what I just did to you

483
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:32,420
guys. And then run around like I'm scared. Or someone just pick up their tackle box and just

484
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:56,760
move a hundred feet that way. What's a taco box? Tackle box. We already went over cheeses.

485
01:46:59,779 --> 01:47:08,090
My favorite cheese is Swiss cheese. That's unpopular though. People don't like Swiss cheese.

486
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:17,100
They think it's just smells and is gross. Why? The same people that will eat brie and talk about how

487
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:27,850
brie is the best will be angry that I said I like Swiss. They both stink. They both have like a very

488
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:35,560
distinct flavor to them. Why? Why is your cheese better than my cheese? I think it's pretty big.

489
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:47,899
Nine and a half inches. That's a, that's a big one. Brie cheese tastes like plastic. Brie cheese.

490
01:47:47,899 --> 01:48:18,149
I don't like brie. I don't, I'm not a fan at all. This one's a big one. Wow. 1.7 pounds,

491
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:26,680
14, almost 15 inches, $45 keeping it. So I have a question. I feel, I feel like I'm,

492
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:32,600
it's not hard to do this. I just hit right click and rip them out of the ocean.

493
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:51,819
It's not hard to fish germ. I don't, I don't say that. I said that like an hour ago and everybody

494
01:48:51,819 --> 01:49:19,180
told me I was a dumb person. What was that? There's actual noise behind me. I'm not playing that.

495
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:44,149
I'm not doing a werewolf thing again. Oh, it's, it's you. Okay. I, I'm over that. What level am I

496
01:49:44,149 --> 01:50:16,579
for? Something's right there. I'm still playing this. Yeah, that's all right. I'm having a good

497
01:50:16,579 --> 01:50:26,310
time. That's not a bite. That's just a little pull. I feel like this is going to be a big one.

498
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:31,529
Right there. Come on. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there.

499
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:50,100
Pull it down. Get that pet food. Oh, this is the good shit. Nice. Oh, impossible to place. Oh,

500
01:50:51,909 --> 01:51:13,989
I can't take this one. I have a full bag. I think it might be time to go to another place.

501
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:32,600
Sell, sell. Is there a, wait, hold on. Can I just sell? Backpack. Fish keeper. Okay. How do I,

502
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:40,619
can I sell early morning, early morning pet food? How do I, can I sell specials, licenses, fish

503
01:51:40,619 --> 01:52:04,630
keeper? I don't think I can do anything else with this. Dude, look at it in 3D. Yeah, this,

504
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:10,470
I gotta release this one. All right. So we got one pound, one pound. I want at least another,

505
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:24,010
at least one pound. Give me like another full pound catfish and we can go. This is the good

506
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:42,149
spot for the catfish right here. This is a good one. But what is that bird? That is the most

507
01:52:42,149 --> 01:52:53,460
distinct bird. I know what that is. Is it a chickadee? The one that goes, I hear it's,

508
01:52:53,460 --> 01:53:23,399
it's the only thing that they do. I gotta recast this. Oh, by the way, Lewis cheese, Lewis cheese,

509
01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:33,380
Lewis cheese. It's time for you to wake up. Lewis cheese. Wake up now. Wake up now. Lewis cheese.

510
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:46,970
You guys were fucking early. I looked over here. I was going to do it in about 20, 30 seconds

511
01:53:46,970 --> 01:54:00,359
because it was 1 54 30 is when I need to do it. You guys did it so early. He's here. All right.

512
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,079
You guys have given this, this, this poor dude, you've given like 5,000 dings. I hope this,

513
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:12,359
yeah, this, if you have notifications, sounds on Twitch, I didn't even need to say anything.

514
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:19,899
You guys just pinged him like fucking 6,000 times. He's probably going to be screaming, holding his

515
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:39,100
ears. Let me know when you start playing something entertaining. Thanks. Yeah. What was your name?

516
01:54:44,310 --> 01:55:01,369
What was your name? Who was that? Who said that? I need one more catfish. Then we'll go somewhere

517
01:55:01,369 --> 01:55:12,680
else. No, we're not doing this. I, I ain't the front desk at a hotel. I'm not going to.

518
01:55:15,939 --> 01:55:37,819
Hello, Mr. Albert. It's your 8 AM wake up call. Give me, I gotta go back to the other one. Oh,

519
01:55:37,819 --> 01:55:58,920
what's going on? Oh, the werewolf is coming back. Well, um, we're staying here. Thanks for recommending

520
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:16,890
places in Boston to go. I had a great time. I'm glad you did. Boston's a great city. This stream

521
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:20,649
is making people fall asleep actually. So he needs to yell people's usernames to keep viewers up.

522
01:56:23,699 --> 01:56:28,340
What's the best burger in Boston? I don't know. I actually don't know that answer to that question.

523
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:53,100
Best burger in Las Vegas. I got that one. You already know it. Let's already say it for me.

524
01:56:53,739 --> 01:57:17,670
I'm not Shake Shack. What? Hash House or Go Go? Oh, McDonald's. Who? What? All right. Listen,

525
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:22,390
wait, wait, there may be people here that were not here when I've talked about this before a few

526
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:31,369
times at the link. It's the name of a casino. It's a casino hotel. There is a restaurant inside of

527
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:38,329
that restaurant is a little place that we like to call Hash House or Go Go. It is a 24 hour

528
01:57:38,329 --> 01:57:51,000
establishment. And inside there, there's an expansive menu of chicken, hamburger, waffles,

529
01:57:52,039 --> 01:58:05,100
24 hours. There is a burger on that menu, which I highly recommend. It is the blue cheese stuffed

530
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:15,659
burger under the hamburger section. It is the best hamburger I have ever had in my entire life.

531
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:25,350
All right. We're on a fishing trip. Somebody's asleep and no one's listening to. I'm like so

532
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:38,979
close to this person's ear telling them this. Why am I turning like a castaway like Tom Hanks right

533
01:58:38,979 --> 01:58:47,829
now? I'm like losing my mind. God just wakes up. Dude, what are you talking? What's, what are you

534
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:55,460
doing? Did anything, did I get any bites? Sorry. I just, I just, I needed to like make sure you knew.

535
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,779
Wake up, wake up. Inception.

536
01:59:13,619 --> 01:59:18,899
Everyone's asleep. I get up and I stand in front of them and I do a full like just presentation.

537
01:59:19,539 --> 01:59:34,979
I need to tell you this. It's so important. Hash House or Go Go. Bring your laptop over. Yeah,

538
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:55,539
open it up. I need one more fish and I can get out of here. But for real, the burger at Hash

539
01:59:55,539 --> 02:00:04,890
House or Go Go in the Link is so good. I've not eaten a hamburger that was better than that

540
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:35,659
in my life. L-I-N-Q the Link. Somebody eat this. Now I can't speak. I know there are other Hash

541
02:00:35,659 --> 02:00:41,659
House or Go Go's, but I cannot speak to the quality of the other ones. Whether the executive chef is

542
02:00:41,659 --> 02:00:51,609
of the Las Vegas in the Link chef. That's the one I'm speaking of. So if you go to Hash House or Go

543
02:00:51,609 --> 02:00:58,090
Go in Florida or something and you're like, this sucks. Well, I, you're not the right one.

544
02:01:11,369 --> 02:01:16,100
I have to, okay. I think of my games broken. I do. I think of my game. My game is broken. I need to

545
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:23,939
go that. Okay. Finally I can walk over here now. Do I like shellfish? I'm one of those weirdos that

546
02:01:23,939 --> 02:01:31,699
loves crab, but hates lobster. It just, it seems impossible. It seems so stupid and impossible,

547
02:01:31,699 --> 02:01:40,970
but it's, it's true. See, that's weird. Same really. I was assuming people are going to think that was

548
02:01:40,970 --> 02:02:01,500
odd. Here we go. Crab takes a lot of work. Yeah. That's why I usually just have somebody do it for

549
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:08,739
me. That's not big enough. That's not big enough. What do you mean? I can't keep this? Why didn't I

550
02:02:08,739 --> 02:02:17,159
throw away one? It's too much weight. I only have 4.4 pounds. I need a bigger fish hut. Damn it.

551
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:28,579
Okay. That's what's going on. Fish hut medium 15 pounds. All right. That's the problem.

552
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:33,930
What am I? I can't keep. All right. I have to leave. I have to go back to my house.

553
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:45,539
All right. I'm out. Back to my house. King crab is my favorite. Probably my favorite seafood.

554
02:02:45,539 --> 02:02:49,859
Somewhere. King crab is similar. King crab is expensive. I don't, you can't really get it

555
02:02:49,859 --> 02:03:06,680
all the time, but it is, I love king crab. Blue crab. Blue crab is good, but I, it has a different

556
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:12,439
flavor profile for me. I'm not a huge fan of blue crab or like dungeon crab. I've had dungeon crab

557
02:03:12,439 --> 02:03:18,279
once and it was strange. It was really, it was like a very ammonia tasting story. It was very

558
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:33,479
weird. I didn't like it. Dungeon crab. Is that my dungeon? Dungeon? Yeah. Rocky Lake. What level

559
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:45,989
my four? Any fours? Dungeon is crab is harbor trash. No, there's, there's a really expensive

560
02:03:45,989 --> 02:03:53,609
crab that I really didn't like and I could, I could barely eat it. Damn it. I need, what level

561
02:03:53,609 --> 02:04:03,800
do I need to be? Is there any fives? No, that's, this is not here. What about snow crab? I don't

562
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:10,390
know. I, Rocky Lake's the next one. I need to go home. Inventory. All right. Where's my stuff?

563
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:19,909
Home. There we are. Mudspin 1200. Get that on. Mono 007. Two, that's, I, that's, I don't know.

564
02:04:19,909 --> 02:04:35,640
I have no idea. Can I put this on? Fish hut medium. Why can I not put this on? Something

565
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:49,850
going on here? Backpack. Do I like calamari? Only fried. I think it's just open some loot boxes.

566
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:59,659
There are no loot boxes in this game. Is it just on or am I not allowed to use this yet?

567
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:14,090
I think that's on, right? Well, whatever. I'm going to, who likes cheese? Anybody in Lone Star

568
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:25,189
like cheese? Shiner. Dough balls. Dough balls. Pet food. Ooh. I'm going, I'm going back to town.

569
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:43,960
Let's see. Catfish right here. Pet food. Leeches. I have pet food right now. But yeah. King crab's

570
02:05:43,960 --> 02:06:01,579
my favorite. Holy shit. Look at how misty it is. Now this is cool. I would go fishing like this.

571
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:13,479
Uh oh. He's queuing up the werewolf sound again. No, I'm not. Don't listen to these

572
02:06:13,479 --> 02:06:22,729
liars in chat. They're lying to you. You vape. We get it. Oh yeah. I still have to do that.

573
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:26,760
I still have to do that thing that I was going to do a long time ago.

574
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:34,180
And remember that thing that I was going to do? I don't think any of you guys remember.

575
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:37,699
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it then. That's, it's just, it's just, it's just stupid.

576
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:49,239
I remember. All right. Some people remember and promise a lot of things. Yeah, I do. I don't

577
02:06:49,239 --> 02:06:55,479
promise anything. I just come up with ideas and then I see minus two, minus three, and then I go,

578
02:06:55,479 --> 02:07:14,199
oh, that's not a good idea. Maybe I should change my plans. You promised Dr. Oz in the next rumble.

579
02:07:14,199 --> 02:07:21,930
I know. You think I forgot? That's one of the most important new characters. How could I forget that?

580
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:49,529
Any bites? Nah. Did you wake up Louis Cheese? I did. I promised Ace Attorney. No, I didn't. I said

581
02:07:49,529 --> 02:07:53,050
I was going to check it out off stream and see if I wanted to stream it and it turned out I did not

582
02:07:53,050 --> 02:08:19,619
want to stream it. I was very honest. Nothing over here. Changing spots. You promised you would start

583
02:08:19,619 --> 02:08:30,310
drinking wine instead of beer. I don't drink beer. I drink, for low alcohol content, beverages for

584
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:40,739
alcohol, I drink wine and I drink red wine. Well, I don't drink beer. You guys, you guys have known

585
02:08:40,739 --> 02:09:10,300
that for almost two years. Fucking werewolf. What about high alcohol content? Good vodkas, like high,

586
02:09:10,859 --> 02:09:21,699
quality vodkas. Not the fingernail polish removal. That's like four bucks for a handle. No.

587
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:41,880
And scotches. I like whiskey. I don't drink it that much anymore though. Crystal Skull, Dan

588
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:58,039
Ackroyd vodka. Crystal Skull actually was pretty good. It was not bad. I didn't hate it. You know

589
02:09:58,039 --> 02:10:06,439
what I do want to get though is I want to get, I want to get Stone Cold's beer. What's it called?

590
02:10:06,439 --> 02:10:14,069
Like Stone Cold's beer. It's like Skull, like Skull Crusher or something. It's called something.

591
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:28,300
I want to try it. Broken Skull IPA. There it is. Has anybody had Broken Skull? I'm not a big beer

592
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:42,380
drinker, but I mean, I feel like I've been pretty good. It's really good. I have to put new bait on.

593
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:57,210
This is ridiculous. It's pretty good. I'm going to track it down. IPAs taste like a new carpet.

594
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:24,710
Is there a certain like time of day should I put new bait on? Do I like it? That song always kind

595
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:30,869
of jumps up on me. All right, Pep Foods is not doing it. Let's go back to worms. I need to get

596
02:11:30,869 --> 02:11:42,489
to level five. Can I buy a casting rod? I don't think I can. Rods. Value Spin. Telefloat. Value

597
02:11:42,489 --> 02:11:55,109
Spin. Is this a casting? There's a lot of money. I only have 2100 bucks. Spinning rod. Value Spin.

598
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:18,149
Okay, well I own it. Try Polish vodka. It's incredible. Yeah, there are some really good

599
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:31,189
vodkas. There are. I worried about my sleeping schedule, but this stream fixed it. You're welcome.

600
02:12:31,829 --> 02:12:51,539
I'm glad I can be of service. I got a bluegill. Jerma, look at the game chat. You know, I've never

601
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:58,020
once ever thought it was something that I was going to do or been told to pay attention to in

602
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:31,079
game chat. I will take things that I've never thought of to do for 5000 Alec. You guys couldn't

603
02:13:31,079 --> 02:13:46,409
press minus two fast enough for that one. Well, that's good. Why am I trying to game minus twos?

604
02:13:46,409 --> 02:13:50,970
I should be trying to game plus twos. That's how it works, right? I have to balance it out.

605
02:13:51,770 --> 02:14:10,060
He's fighting like crazy. Don't take this fish to avoid a hundred dollar fine. This is my backyard.

606
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:34,470
What? Fish verification in progress. What? I don't have a license to be here? I thought I did. It's

607
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:54,920
still the same day, isn't it? It's not a different state. Your license has a maximum. Isn't it the

608
02:14:54,920 --> 02:15:05,350
same day? Oh no, it's the next day. Well, I just need to get to level five and I can go to the next

609
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:29,909
area. That's all I care about. Come here. They didn't verify that fish on Twitter. I'm not verified

610
02:15:29,909 --> 02:15:49,800
on Twitter. Like my Twitter could be fake. I don't put anything there worth any real value to anybody

611
02:15:49,880 --> 02:16:08,579
besides the like stream starting message. Oh, what's that? That's new. Blacktail Shiner.

612
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:44,059
This used to be a main A stream. Well, that's a, that's like a 2014 reference. Whoa, that thing is

613
02:16:44,059 --> 02:17:18,459
big. Big but small. Wide but short. 39 bucks. Worms are doing a good job today. It's a larper.

614
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:26,649
Come on. Where was there? How much money is it to go to the next area?

615
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:34,309
I'm gonna move this way. I'm gonna get close to friends. What do you do with the fishes that you

616
02:17:34,309 --> 02:17:50,569
catch? You sell them. Okay. Are you fishing or are you like trying to get free television?

617
02:17:54,139 --> 02:18:07,079
Oh my god. That can't be real. That's a joke. This is, that's a radio tower. This is not a fishing

618
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:21,290
pole. How do you cast this? I feel like the only way to cast this is if you spin in a circle for

619
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:51,770
five, 10 straight seconds and then just let it go. Holy shit. That thing is big. Give me level five.

620
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:56,329
Wow. I forget what that. Remember what I said at the beginning of the stream? This is how it happens.

621
02:18:57,510 --> 02:19:21,860
10 minutes or three hours. Yeah. Yeah. We made it. Oh, a crappy. But why? I don't know.

622
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:31,299
It, sometimes it's nice just to talk to you guys. You know, level five reached. Let's go.

623
02:19:36,899 --> 02:19:45,850
Rocky Lake, Colorado. I unlocked dough balls, grub one, uh, schlopp schlopp schlopp spoon,

624
02:19:46,889 --> 02:19:52,739
narrow spoon, spinner, flies. Oh, cool. I got to, okay. This is where the level,

625
02:19:52,739 --> 02:20:00,360
this is where the game really begins. Look at all this stuff. Open feeder. All right. And then I want

626
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:08,729
to go back in inventory, go home. I want my, I want my rod. I'm going to go back to my house,

627
02:20:08,729 --> 02:20:29,540
right? I am in my house. 196 bucks. All right. Inventory. Where's the rod? Home. Here we are.

628
02:20:30,489 --> 02:20:38,809
Okay. Value spin. Six, three. Item can, item can be replaced only with item of the same type.

629
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:57,579
What are you talking about? What does that mean? I'm already using this one?

630
02:20:58,299 --> 02:21:08,120
Oh, all right. Shit. This is all right. Camo vest, fish hut, extra small. I think that I already

631
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:16,180
have it on. All right. I got it on. I have a new, the rod is on. I need a new hook. Shop. Wait, how

632
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:24,979
much is it to go to, uh, Colorado? Rocky Lake. It's $2,000 to go here. Come on. And a license.

633
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:35,129
Six. So I need 2,600 bucks to go to Colorado. Damn it. All right. I can do this. Let's just go

634
02:21:35,129 --> 02:21:41,340
back to Mud River. I still have a license. 821, right? Let's go. 1,200 bucks to be there for a

635
02:21:41,340 --> 02:22:02,950
day. What? I just go here. I just need to make money. It's time to grind. No, I only need like

636
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:14,020
five, 600 bucks. It really is an MMO, isn't it? Yeah, it kind of is. Is this the new rod?

637
02:22:18,389 --> 02:22:27,610
I think this is the new rod. Hello. Four, five, six, two, four, five, six, two.

638
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:50,649
Uh, the water is over here. I didn't even, I guess I caught that. This is gonna take a while.

639
02:22:51,450 --> 02:23:16,760
How do I make money fast? You can't. I just want to see Colorado. Damn it. I gotta get back to

640
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:32,520
throwing it. It's not the shore. I'm gonna go on the bridge. What's on there? Worms? Yeah. I need

641
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:45,129
money. All right. I'm just gonna fill my backpack. 15 pounds. Shouldn't take long. It actually,

642
02:23:45,129 --> 02:23:57,260
it may take potentially like an hour. No, well, 24 bucks. All right. Keep it. Five, you know,

643
02:23:57,260 --> 02:24:10,010
10, 20 more of those. Just buy it? No. I'm not hitting the free to play wall and climbing over

644
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:27,190
it with a briefcase full of money. Yes, there's somebody standing here. There is. In case you

645
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:38,059
didn't know. These things are so cheap. I need something bitter. Like an IPA. That sounds good

646
02:24:38,059 --> 02:25:07,129
to me. Something bigger. I caught a fish. How do you do like a thumbs up? I guess, hold on. When you,

647
02:25:07,129 --> 02:25:51,000
when in doubt, just do Homer Simpson. No! That's Homer Simpson. Sideways. Homer Simpson. Look, it's,

648
02:25:51,799 --> 02:26:04,760
imagine Homer Simpson lying down on his bed. On his back. You can't see that?

649
02:26:14,889 --> 02:26:29,049
Bait was eaten. Horn wart? I wish there was in-game voice. I would be right behind this guy and I

650
02:26:29,049 --> 02:26:43,100
would just turn on the voice and I would go and do it until he until he turned around. No more bait.

651
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:59,750
Pet food. I want to catch one of the, let me just check and see something here. Species. Channel

652
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:02,790
catfish. Pet food. There's, there are over, they are, they're over here.

653
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:18,520
Somewhere. Stay out of my spot. We can share. Look, you guys should be able to get along. You

654
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:26,739
both shop at the same clothing store. In fact, so do I. And we should all be friends because

655
02:27:27,379 --> 02:27:38,469
we all go to the same store. We're all wearing the same like plaid shirts. All right, I'm going this

656
02:27:38,469 --> 02:27:46,819
way. Get out of his spot. No, there is no my spot in this game. We share it as a group of fishermen.

657
02:27:47,700 --> 02:28:06,090
This is definitely big enough for all of us to stay here. They both have those gigantic antennas.

658
02:28:14,229 --> 02:28:29,860
26 bucks. How much? I have 1.7 pounds. There, this is my spot now. You don't have to complain

659
02:28:29,860 --> 02:29:28,280
about me being in your spot. Lots of drama in the planet fishing competitive community. That's a

660
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:52,200
good one. Kick. You can't kick people. Do you think that that is a service available in this game?

661
02:29:53,159 --> 02:31:02,170
Kill them with kindness. See? Like, no, why are they going over to the lily pads? That's passive

662
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:21,000
aggressive. You can pass time with tea. I waited an hour to remove the fog. What? No, you can't.

663
02:31:21,799 --> 02:31:37,049
Is that real? But what about everybody else on the server? This ain't working. This is, this spot

664
02:31:37,129 --> 02:32:38,090
sucks. Somebody give, somebody give $50? Oh no, that means that they're watching. Oh man, okay,

665
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:48,809
big bitch. Casted it back out. Oh my god. That was, thank you shitty viewbot for the 5,000

666
02:32:48,809 --> 02:32:58,819
bits. 50 bucks. Big bits. Challenge the toxic fisher to a 1v1. You won't do it, I bet.

667
02:32:59,909 --> 02:33:03,430
Well, thank you, shitty viewbot for the $50. It's a huge amount of money.

668
02:33:04,069 --> 02:33:07,989
And, um, they're probably watching the stream right now. In fact, they're right next to me.

669
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:17,959
Uh, how about this? Whoever gets the next, next fish, whoever has the bigger fish, pound wise,

670
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:34,809
wins. Starting right now. I love the eye, eye blinking. That's the kind of eye blinking that's

671
02:33:34,809 --> 02:33:42,379
like, motherfucker, you think you're gonna, mm, mm, whoever gets the bigger fish, right? I fucking

672
02:33:42,379 --> 02:33:55,719
guarantee it's gonna be me. Asshole. That was, that was going on inside of the head there.

673
02:33:56,440 --> 02:34:15,209
There's this place at the Link Casino Resort, Hash House of GoGo. Some of the finest hamburgers

674
02:34:15,209 --> 02:34:26,059
you'll ever eat in your life. Tasty, juicy, full of flavor. With a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

675
02:34:55,239 --> 02:35:02,840
There's no fish over here. There's no fish over here. I'm, all right, I'm going back to,

676
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:17,620
I'm going back to your spot. Stop using the pet food. I want a, I want a catfish. They're over here.

677
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:41,459
And they eat the pet food. It's their favorite food. That thing's fucking tiny. Oh, that's not

678
02:35:41,459 --> 02:35:45,940
even the same guy. Not even the right guy. What I meant to say was that, that's a good fish.

679
02:35:49,940 --> 02:36:00,979
Oh, my stomach. I thought he was coming to show. I thought it was the guy going,

680
02:36:00,979 --> 02:36:08,389
yeah, look what I got. Here we go. This is my time to shine. Look at this thing. This thing is huge.

681
02:36:10,659 --> 02:36:21,959
Holy shit. That's 10 inches. 10 inches. What do you got? Hold it up. I just saw it on the line.

682
02:36:21,959 --> 02:36:43,639
Did he throw it away? I think he threw it away. Disqualification automatic one.

683
02:36:43,639 --> 02:37:05,989
0.7 pounds. Where is it? Oh, it doesn't say 0.2. Did you get something? I'm waiting. 0.748,

684
02:37:05,989 --> 02:37:13,180
10.1 inches. We'll see it. You can't lie. This game has a, a kill feed, a fish feed.

685
02:37:13,899 --> 02:37:33,850
All right. We know what I got. He's telling the truth. All right. Fine. Round. Did he actually

686
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:45,930
win that first round? Cause this is round one, two out of three. Scroll up the chat. I can't,

687
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:59,030
how do you scroll up? I can't. I'm watching his stream. Yes. He's got a better pole than me,

688
02:37:59,030 --> 02:38:04,229
though. He's got a bigger pole. He's got a more like, he's got more experience in the game.

689
02:38:04,229 --> 02:38:13,899
All right. This is it. What'd he get? 0.97 pound trophy bluegill, 0.66 pound sunfish.

690
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:28,299
Well, how long was it though? Smaller fish. Yeah. Well, I, we don't use them the same rods.

691
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:36,379
It wouldn't be no change in the rules. This is like having a boxing match,

692
02:38:37,659 --> 02:38:45,299
but I don't have to put on boxing gloves. That's not fair. That person's going to beat the shit out

693
02:38:45,299 --> 02:38:58,489
of the other person. If we're at a competition, why do I get to, why do you have to wear boxing

694
02:38:58,489 --> 02:39:16,420
gloves? But I don't, I can just like punch with my hands. Boxing gloves protect the hand, not the

695
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:31,219
other person. It doesn't protect the other person's face. Do you see what I'm getting at here? No,

696
02:39:31,219 --> 02:39:35,940
I'm saying without the boxing gloves, if a boxer punches somebody in the face, it's going to do

697
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:55,559
like damage. Boxing gloves are worn to make it so they don't like, they don't do damage. What do

698
02:39:55,559 --> 02:40:15,700
you guys think boxing gloves are for? For boxing? Is he showing me his fish? I'm not paying attention.

699
02:40:45,379 --> 02:40:48,739
I must have been thinking of, I must have been, I'm sorry guys. Let me correct myself. I must

700
02:40:48,739 --> 02:40:52,979
have been thinking of sockum buffers. That's what I was thinking of. Wrong thing, wrong sport.

701
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:05,739
He got one. What is it? A 0.2 pound, 0.29 pound. I can do better than that.

702
02:41:39,879 --> 02:41:52,549
Push him. That's so fucked up.

703
02:41:58,069 --> 02:42:04,709
Soccer shoes are for protecting the feet. No, how come you don't just walk around barefoot?

704
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:35,020
It's nice work. He didn't win. I need to catch something. He won twice.

705
02:42:36,459 --> 02:42:54,440
I get to win. I get to win because it's my stream. I get to win. It's my stream. He won on his stream.

706
02:42:55,000 --> 02:43:06,969
Yeah, so now I get to win on my stream. I'm just going both hands just into the water. Fuck,

707
02:43:06,969 --> 02:43:34,299
I missed my time. What's he got? Uh oh. Let me see. 0.5. I can do so much better than this.

708
02:43:34,299 --> 02:43:39,500
I'm just not getting distracted by talking about how boxing gloves hurt more or something. I don't

709
02:43:39,500 --> 02:44:07,270
even remember what it was. Come on. Why are they getting stuff and not me? I got to take pet food

710
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:17,459
off. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here it is. Oh, this is a big one. This is a big one. This

711
02:44:17,459 --> 02:44:25,559
thing is fucking huge. Look at that thing. Don't break the line. This is the biggest fish in the

712
02:44:25,559 --> 02:44:38,329
whole fucking lake. Too much tension. No, no, no, no. Look at this thing. It's like a whale.

713
02:44:38,969 --> 02:45:02,979
Come here. Come here. Can he grab onto my hips and pull me forward? It's getting away. Come on.

714
02:45:02,979 --> 02:45:15,719
It's right there. Where is it? Holy shit.

715
02:45:21,639 --> 02:45:39,270
Three and a half pounds. 18 inches long. That's a small mouth buffalo. 81 bucks. You got it.

716
02:45:39,270 --> 02:46:00,709
Let's take a look. Take a look. That's as big as as we are tall. Let me stand back. You win.

717
02:46:00,709 --> 02:46:16,790
Winner is you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I lost the first two. It's okay. Keeping this one. Let's go back to

718
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:51,770
back. Throw it at him. No, why is that not? It's only supposed to be like five up. Oh, come on.

719
02:46:51,770 --> 02:47:26,329
It's supposed to only be five up. Give me a break. Someone on here doesn't even need to try. I'm so

720
02:47:26,329 --> 02:47:34,170
happy about that. This was worth the three hours in this game. New pond, new pond. I need, I don't

721
02:47:34,170 --> 02:47:51,829
have any money. I need more money. Is it worth another three hours? I don't think so, but I'm

722
02:47:51,829 --> 02:48:05,239
not giving up yet. Not until we get to the new pond. I'm not going anywhere. What's the name of

723
02:48:05,239 --> 02:48:12,780
this game? It's called Fishing Planet, I think. Planet Fish. One of those two. Just type in

724
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:34,600
Fishing. Fishing Planet. Why the second one? I feel like the spot was right here.

725
02:48:38,219 --> 02:48:42,040
I'm not going to play a Dance Dance Revolution game. That's not going to happen.

726
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:46,299
I'm sorry to get everybody's hopes up, but I'm not going to play that game on stream.

727
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:58,579
You can go ahead. You can ride. That's fine. It's not going to happen. And if I ever did it,

728
02:48:58,579 --> 02:49:20,889
I would be sober. All right. 34. Oh, how much money am I? Okay. I'm going to fill the backpack.

729
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:32,260
You couldn't dance sober. Actually, I do know how to dance fairly well. And not like, not like,

730
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:38,709
oh, look, I'm jokey. I'm wearing a fat suit yesterday. No. With the right beat, I can move.

731
02:49:39,350 --> 02:49:54,889
That's not a lie. That's for real. With the right beat, I can move. I'm hitting my body. My legs can

732
02:49:54,889 --> 02:50:06,139
spin around. Nobody does the finger snaps anymore. That needs to come back. Like the wrist,

733
02:50:06,139 --> 02:50:12,059
the wrist and the elbow go down. Bang. Bang. Bang. Why did that go out of style?

734
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:52,940
Hasn't he? I'm still waiting for you boomers to move on. No. Go look at the green screen dancing.

735
02:50:52,940 --> 02:50:59,319
Remember when I was like moving my legs around? Like bang. I was doing some like leg snaps.

736
02:50:59,879 --> 02:51:03,000
Go watch the full screen green screen dancing and you tell me that was bad.

737
02:51:16,649 --> 02:51:32,489
You did one good clip. Oh, did only one. It was like four. You did dad dancing. No, I did not.

738
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:42,120
That there's a very dad dancing is two fists up. The your left hand goes slightly above.

739
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:51,559
Look, I'll just show you. This is the dad dance. It's like this. Two fists. One hand is slightly

740
02:51:51,559 --> 02:52:03,049
above the other one. And it's up down like this. That's the dad dance. I used to film weddings. I

741
02:52:03,049 --> 02:52:43,610
know. Why do I have grandma hair? Because I fucking want it. Did you get paid to film weddings or did

742
02:52:43,610 --> 02:52:48,649
you just what you do? You act like I'm just like filming a wedding that I'm what are you talking

743
02:52:48,649 --> 02:53:17,020
about? Why would I do that? Yes, it was a service that I was hired to do. All right. You kind of

744
02:53:17,020 --> 02:53:29,959
look like a creep to be honest. What kind of like what kind of comment is that? That's a comment

745
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:36,440
I would remove typically. I'm going to remove that comment. I'm going to remove that one. I think.

746
02:53:37,780 --> 02:54:04,889
No, it's already gone. It's all right. You only read mean messages because they put a fish next

747
02:54:04,889 --> 02:54:30,459
to it or they put it in red text. All right. I'm on. I got it. This ain't working. I got to move.

748
02:54:31,180 --> 02:54:49,420
I want to go a spot that I haven't gone to before. Like over here. Here we go.

749
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:57,340
Phylactery Lich just gave four gifted subs. Thank you Phylactery. If you missed last night,

750
02:54:57,340 --> 02:55:05,000
Phylactery gave an absolute shitload of money on top of this and it looks like we're getting

751
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:17,399
part two of that. There's 20 more from Phylactery Lich. 20 more community subs. That was 24 which

752
02:55:17,399 --> 02:55:29,129
makes 420. There you go. I get it. It's been fulfilled. Yes. Thank you so much though for

753
02:55:29,129 --> 02:55:40,760
those community subs. It's a lot of subs. 24, 420. What am I? What's going on? Is this a big one?

754
02:55:41,399 --> 02:55:54,059
I think I got stuck on a lily pad. Wait, pull this back. What is this? I don't even. How am I

755
02:55:54,059 --> 02:56:04,280
doing this? What the fuck? How did I do that? I could do a super cast. That didn't even go that

756
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:39,610
far. What? I'm missing something here. Am I going to aim up? I can't. That doesn't work. Why is there

757
02:56:39,770 --> 02:57:17,479
cat? Got it. Okay, $29. Where'd it go? Why didn't do that when I can just do this? It goes further.

758
02:57:17,479 --> 02:57:47,350
Can we get another blue cheese burger ad please? Fishing level almost level six. Run ads. Not with

759
02:57:47,350 --> 02:58:02,860
4,000 people here. How do you do the long cast? It's you hold it. If you have the right,

760
02:58:05,799 --> 02:58:15,620
you hold right. Bugs. Okay. All right. What's that? Red with honey. All right. I got some new stuff

761
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:33,559
here. Nah, no ads. Getting to 15 pounds and hoping that's enough money. New lake. I'm trying. I need

762
02:58:33,559 --> 02:58:46,940
to get to 15 pounds so I can sell all my fish. Answer their question. What do you mean? What

763
02:58:46,940 --> 02:59:00,170
question? What was it? Was somebody in here? Who said something? Don't get stuck in the tree. All

764
02:59:00,170 --> 02:59:12,680
right. These are all 35, 35, 35. They might be enough. How did I forget that fast? Because

765
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:18,840
there's, I don't know, there's like three or four things going on at the same time. I forgot. I did.

766
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:34,120
I have no idea what's going on. What happened? Hydrate from the pond. Okay. You hold right click

767
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:45,899
and then you press left click. If you have the right bow, the right rod. That's a $36 fish

768
02:59:45,899 --> 03:00:01,479
right there. 11.2 pounds. I can do like three or four more, but it kind of sucks that I couldn't

769
03:00:01,479 --> 03:00:18,790
get it to work. That's a big one. Don't take this fish. I'll take a, that's all right. I'll

770
03:00:18,790 --> 03:00:44,860
take a $44 fine. Verifying. I still get to keep it. What was the thing that we were talking about

771
03:00:44,860 --> 03:01:00,010
before? I forget what it was. It was not the best ice cream. Oh, ads. Right. Yeah. I'm not

772
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:05,379
going to run ads because when you run an ad, if I were to do like three minutes of ads right now,

773
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:27,379
1500 people would probably try it. No, I don't, I don't run ads on my stream. This is an ad free

774
03:01:27,379 --> 03:01:32,920
viewing experience. I can't control when you come to the stream, if you get a pre-roll,

775
03:01:33,639 --> 03:01:57,059
but I, this is an ad free viewing experience. I don't run ads ever. My default dance. How much

776
03:01:57,059 --> 03:02:03,989
money do I make if I run an ad? I have no idea. I don't have any, I have no gauge to tell you that.

777
03:02:04,629 --> 03:02:21,379
I don't do it. So I can't really tell you. He gave us ads during Terraria. Yeah. As a joke.

778
03:02:22,659 --> 03:02:40,620
All right. There's a fish are all gone in here. You guys stole them all right here, right in the

779
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:51,690
lilies. No, this is also a joke ad. You literally caught the three sunfish. I need one of I'm sorry.

780
03:02:51,690 --> 03:03:28,440
Well, you got a two pounder. Oh no, that's not you. What would you rate this game? Um, uh, come

781
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:51,209
back to me in like 20 more minutes. I have to deliberate on this one. Uh, four, but, but, but,

782
03:03:51,370 --> 03:04:06,469
but, but, but, but it gets, it gets two and a half extra points full on that meter for being

783
03:04:06,469 --> 03:04:21,399
relaxing. So it's a 4.2 out of 10, but it turns into like a 6.8, 6.6. That's a good one. 6.65.

784
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:35,899
Cause I could see like two or three of my friends just hanging out,

785
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:42,739
just catching fish and comparing how big they are. It's free. It's free to just do what I'm

786
03:04:42,739 --> 03:04:48,260
doing right now. There's no reason to not at least try it if you wanted to play a fishing game,

787
03:04:48,260 --> 03:05:06,649
whatever. It's just here. Increments of a thousand. What? 6.65. That's increments of a hundred.

788
03:05:07,909 --> 03:05:30,979
So yeah, it's a 665. It's a, it's a 441 without the extra 2.2 percentage, 2.2, 221,

789
03:05:31,379 --> 03:05:34,739
whatever, of friend interaction points. You get it. And it's free.

790
03:05:35,540 --> 03:05:46,620
You've messed me up with this whole hundred point scale right now. This thousand point,

791
03:05:46,620 --> 03:05:56,899
hundreds, hundreds of a decibel denomination. It's a four out of 10 with 2.6 extra points

792
03:05:56,899 --> 03:06:20,709
of friend and free interaction. Just say seven out of 10. I wouldn't give this a seven out of 10.

793
03:06:31,059 --> 03:06:42,420
It's point scales, point scales are dumb anyways. Do you know why? Cause everybody's afraid to give

794
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:52,819
any game a rating. You give a game like a six and you anger a bunch of people. You give a game like

795
03:06:52,819 --> 03:07:01,540
a nine and you anger a bunch of people. Everyone's terrified to rate anything. That's not a 7.5 to

796
03:07:01,540 --> 03:07:13,979
like an 8.8. Star made a whole video on this. That video is, I will go down in history saying

797
03:07:13,979 --> 03:07:20,360
that I think that is the best YouTube video ever made. That is the best video game related YouTube

798
03:07:20,360 --> 03:07:35,959
video. I'm just going to say it. I think it is the everything is an eight out of 10 star video.

799
03:07:35,959 --> 03:07:54,170
I think it's, it's got some great comedy points on it. Just put it on the corner of the stream.

800
03:08:01,639 --> 03:08:12,520
No, no, I said, no, no, no, no, no, no. Everyone needs to like what I like.

801
03:08:13,399 --> 03:08:29,239
Anger face. Can I please catch one more fish? I got to put the worms back on.

802
03:08:29,799 --> 03:08:35,819
I got like three, four in a row and I haven't seen any paper view. Would you guys, would you

803
03:08:35,819 --> 03:08:45,139
guys watch a pay per view stream? Just curious. If it, if it was like $12 to watch a stream,

804
03:08:45,139 --> 03:08:59,219
would you do it? No, not like me playing fishing. What if it was like German rumble live two and

805
03:08:59,219 --> 03:09:05,190
they were like, and they were like five WWF superstars in it. And I, and I promised that I

806
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:11,670
was going to take a chair hit in the face. Like you knew at some point during that stream, I was

807
03:09:11,670 --> 03:09:16,969
going to take a real chair shot to the face for real. And I would like train and practice and do

808
03:09:16,969 --> 03:09:35,579
it. No, I would never do something like that. Didn't they, they just recently did the

809
03:09:37,420 --> 03:09:45,219
sub streams, right? I would never do that ever. I can't think of one reason to do it. Maybe I,

810
03:09:45,219 --> 03:09:53,180
no, I can't. It's hard to think of a reason why. If you do a sub only stream, that stream is just

811
03:09:53,180 --> 03:10:02,120
going to be restreamed on YouTube on like 500 accounts. It's just how are you going to stop

812
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:11,059
that you alienate and annoy a huge amount of your audience, a majority of your whole audience.

813
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:15,059
And it doesn't even matter anyways, because somebody will just, it's just going to clip it

814
03:10:15,059 --> 03:10:37,479
and put it somewhere else. Use it as a prank. The way I see it is like a maybe a private creative

815
03:10:37,479 --> 03:10:44,120
stream, like a review mentorship thing. Yeah, I honestly, I forget about sub only streams.

816
03:10:45,610 --> 03:10:51,610
Why not? I mean, maybe is a bandwidth a concern? No, why would anybody can just stream on Twitch?

817
03:10:51,610 --> 03:11:01,110
Why don't have password streams? Or just, you know, that would be right. Instead of sub only,

818
03:11:01,110 --> 03:11:19,100
why not do password protected streams? It's kind of the same thing, isn't it? The password is sub.

819
03:11:21,139 --> 03:11:24,579
Password stream could have use. Yeah, you could do like company. Well, I think didn't,

820
03:11:24,579 --> 03:11:30,790
Discord really is starting to drop this whole thing here, right? With doing private streams.

821
03:11:32,729 --> 03:11:36,329
It used to be, this is now, here's a story for you. Back in the day, and I'm talking maybe

822
03:11:37,049 --> 03:11:41,799
six, seven, eight years ago, if you wanted to, we used to do this thing where somebody would screen

823
03:11:41,799 --> 03:11:50,329
share on Skype. We'd have a group call going. And we were always begging, begging and hoping

824
03:11:50,329 --> 03:11:55,370
for a solution just to have kind of a private session where three or four people can just watch.

825
03:11:56,840 --> 03:12:01,719
It was horrible quality. It was really, really delayed. It was really shitty. It wasn't very

826
03:12:01,719 --> 03:12:08,940
good. Discord is start is doing that now. And then steam brought in the streaming too. But it was

827
03:12:08,940 --> 03:12:16,069
super delayed as well. A password protected stream on Twitch is kind of that same deal,

828
03:12:16,069 --> 03:12:29,260
like a screen share. I have not caught a fish in probably 35 minutes. Something's not something's

829
03:12:29,260 --> 03:12:55,590
wrong. But sub streams, I feel like you just kind of make a lot of people angry. I think there's one

830
03:12:55,590 --> 03:13:02,379
way where that works. And it's really, really bad. Honest to God, I think the only way that that

831
03:13:02,379 --> 03:13:09,370
really works if you wanted to do it is permanently turn it on. It's awful. And that's not I think

832
03:13:09,370 --> 03:13:15,379
that's a really, really terrible idea. But I like what are you going to turn it on half the time?

833
03:13:23,700 --> 03:13:27,940
You would never get new viewers. No, but if you get if you mean, if you're gonna go all in on

834
03:13:27,940 --> 03:13:32,409
something like that, you've got you're gonna go all in on that. I don't think you can kind of do

835
03:13:32,409 --> 03:13:37,049
that. Like, well, should I I think you either you go all in or you don't. Alright, finally,

836
03:13:40,549 --> 03:13:49,100
there it is 1000 bucks. All right, but I want to fall back. Have it as a patreon reward. That

837
03:13:49,100 --> 03:14:12,229
makes sense to maybe what's my discord? Do exclamation discord, you'll find the link public.

838
03:14:12,790 --> 03:14:23,020
Anybody can join it. Anybody can use it. That's a pretty good one. You already make thousands

839
03:14:23,020 --> 03:14:27,719
a month from subs and bits. I think that's kind of the like the point too, though, is

840
03:14:28,520 --> 03:14:34,600
now you if you if you have like a bunch of subs, and you're doing well on Twitch,

841
03:14:34,600 --> 03:14:39,180
you're doing good on Twitch. I feel like that's like too daint. Why would you do that? Like,

842
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:42,459
it's kind of daint. Like, oh, I think I'll turn that on. Like, you don't really need to do that.

843
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:47,799
It's not going to gain you any more money. If that's what you're after. I don't think that

844
03:14:47,799 --> 03:15:04,409
would work. I think that's how you lose money. If money is what you're after. There are other

845
03:15:04,409 --> 03:15:17,940
avenues to do that. Alright, 14.3. I'm done. No, I can get one more. One more small one.

846
03:15:37,139 --> 03:15:43,780
Some strivers do sub gate on video playbacks, like on their streams, like on the past broadcasts.

847
03:15:45,909 --> 03:15:49,430
I would never turn that on. Because if a new viewer comes to your channel and wants to know

848
03:15:49,430 --> 03:15:53,670
what you're about, they either have the second that they are currently watching, which we've

849
03:15:53,670 --> 03:15:58,549
talked about, like shitting our diapers before. And that person that has to have a conscious

850
03:15:58,549 --> 03:16:04,469
decision to go, Oh, look, is there anything else that this guy has here that I can like see if I

851
03:16:04,469 --> 03:16:08,309
want to watch this or not? Having VODs, let somebody go back and pick something that they

852
03:16:08,309 --> 03:16:13,909
may think is interesting. And maybe they'll stick around, maybe they'll go, Oh, that was cool. I

853
03:16:13,909 --> 03:16:19,030
like that stream. That was a fun stream or something, right? When you have a sub gate on

854
03:16:19,909 --> 03:16:24,790
past broadcasts or on video highlights for Twitch or something, you are banking completely on the

855
03:16:24,790 --> 03:16:29,190
fact that you are going to be that second that that person comes to the stream is all you got.

856
03:16:46,260 --> 03:16:51,780
15 point. All right. All right. All right. I've got, I've got, I'm good. Time to end the day. I got,

857
03:16:51,780 --> 03:17:02,340
how much money do I got? 4,200. We're good. People who aren't subbed can't catch up on streams either

858
03:17:02,340 --> 03:17:05,620
with it. Oh, that's true too. Like, let's say you subscribe for like three or four months

859
03:17:06,579 --> 03:17:11,940
and then you unsubscribe, you know, for whatever reason, you know, no one is ever obligated to

860
03:17:11,940 --> 03:17:16,680
subscribe to anybody's channel. So if you're subbed for a few months and you have, you know,

861
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:20,600
you're not watching every single stream, you have a, Oh, I'm subbed. Now I can actually see the other

862
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:25,079
content if you wanted to watch it. If you aren't subbed anymore after three, four, five months,

863
03:17:25,079 --> 03:17:28,360
two months, even one month, whatever, you lose access to the thing that you had before.

864
03:17:31,059 --> 03:17:35,979
And it's like, I mean, I kind of, I guess that kind of, that's, you know, I just want everybody

865
03:17:35,979 --> 03:17:43,690
to be able to see stuff that we've already done. I wouldn't, I don't want to put a paywall up for

866
03:17:43,690 --> 03:17:54,700
stuff that's already been done. I need a license here. One day license in Colorado,

867
03:18:02,459 --> 03:18:05,579
$2,000 to go here. This is such a joke. Wait, wait, wait, what's in here?

868
03:18:06,139 --> 03:18:18,020
Crappy. Marshmallows. Have I unlocked marshmallows? Preferred lures. Oh, hold on. I need,

869
03:18:18,020 --> 03:18:25,799
I need a nano spooner. Nano spinners, nano spoons, nano spoons, nano spoons. Do I have a nano spoon?

870
03:18:37,239 --> 03:18:49,290
Nano spoon. What do they like to eat? Marshmallows. I can't buy them. Is there a spoon?

871
03:18:52,489 --> 03:18:59,559
Thing here? Am I just, am I dumb? Oh, I am. Okay. There is more.

872
03:19:00,280 --> 03:19:09,590
If you didn't know, it would be under lures. All right. Spoon, nano spoon. I think I have to,

873
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:21,690
there are 48 pages. Nano, nano spoon, nano spinner, nano spinner, nano spinner, spinner, spinner,

874
03:19:24,059 --> 03:19:28,860
nano spoons, but I'm not old enough for that. Nano spinner. I guess I'll get this one.

875
03:19:29,659 --> 03:19:34,600
Which one looks coolest? I'll get the, I'm going to get the Spider-Man one.

876
03:19:37,209 --> 03:19:54,520
Okay. Barbless nano spinner. Okay. And what food? Marshmallows, maggots, crickets, maggots.

877
03:19:55,899 --> 03:20:08,889
All right. It's live. We're going to get crickets and maggots. Crickets. Here we go. It's got,

878
03:20:08,889 --> 03:20:21,209
I don't, I can't, it's gotta be crickets. Maggots, I'm not old enough. Okay. All right. All right.

879
03:20:24,280 --> 03:20:33,430
New rod. Oh, what have we got? Creek Pro 8, the Omni Float, value spin, the Elemental 6-7.

880
03:20:38,340 --> 03:20:55,079
Think so. 1700. Put it on. Where's my inventory? Okay. Glowing Peership Float. Where's my

881
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:14,940
Horn Warp? Where's the home storage? Okay. The Telefloat. Elemental. All right. Nice. Barbless

882
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:26,899
spinner. The rail must be equipped first. Is it not equipped? Oh, the rail on. Get that barbless

883
03:21:26,899 --> 03:21:36,899
spinner on there. Line must be equipped. Oh, will you fuck off? 262. Got it. Line must be equipped.

884
03:21:36,899 --> 03:21:49,020
I just did. Right there. 209. Backpack is full. What's happening here? What's going on? Please.

885
03:21:50,139 --> 03:21:58,440
All right. I have it here. Backpack is full. How is my backpack full?

886
03:22:02,180 --> 03:22:07,780
That's a slop spoon. I don't want the slop. Five of these? Why do I have five of these?

887
03:22:15,059 --> 03:22:35,559
There we are. Terminal Tackle Weight. Let's go. Rocky Lake. One day past 2,000 bucks.

888
03:22:55,379 --> 03:23:03,770
Colorado. That was it. This rod is probably cool though. Let's take a look. I only need like 100

889
03:23:03,770 --> 03:23:13,219
bucks. Look at this beauty. This thing is a beauty. All right. What we got on here for bait.

890
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:19,590
That's all we know. We don't use bait. This is just this thing. I would love it. I would love

891
03:23:19,590 --> 03:23:30,620
it if it just snapped and just broke. That's a nice rod. Nice new rod. That went very far. That

892
03:23:30,620 --> 03:23:38,299
went across the whole lake. What does that mean? I need to keep it somewhere floating around like

893
03:23:38,299 --> 03:24:13,719
Flappy Bird, right? I can't let it touch anything. Wait. Why is everybody saying minus two? Flappy Bird?

894
03:24:19,260 --> 03:24:46,819
I didn't even know there was somebody on there. That's far. All right. Slow. Stop and go. What

895
03:24:46,819 --> 03:24:57,799
does that mean? Stop and go. Oh, I think somebody's on it. Is that what that means?

896
03:24:59,540 --> 03:25:16,280
Somebody's on it. Somebody's on it. Somebody's on this. I think this is a big one. Oh, that is

897
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:30,069
a big one. That's a spotted bass. $100 fine. Nice. That thing's... Okay. I've done this three times.

898
03:25:32,420 --> 03:25:41,219
Am I going to be three for three and getting in trouble? Yeah. What is the percentage? That seems

899
03:25:41,219 --> 03:25:58,940
like a really high percentage chance to get arrested for it. It's definitely more than one

900
03:25:58,940 --> 03:27:01,510
out of three. It's probably like a 10% chance to get that. Is there anything on this? I can't believe

901
03:27:02,469 --> 03:27:08,780
that Disney and Sony did not come to an agreement for Spider-Man. That's fucking unbelievable to me.

902
03:27:25,059 --> 03:27:44,950
It's turning into a podcast. Big Whoop. 50th superhero in five years. Yeah, but the... Okay.

903
03:27:44,950 --> 03:28:04,520
Those Spider-Man... What the fuck over here? Just Spider-Man. All right. 13 bucks. How much do I need?

904
03:28:08,149 --> 03:28:16,709
Far From Home is my favorite Marvel movie. It just is. Homecoming was very, very, very good too. I

905
03:28:16,709 --> 03:28:21,719
think the... I think the two Spider-Man movies in the MCU are the best. Out of the... All of them

906
03:28:22,280 --> 03:28:39,959
combined. Homecoming sucked? What? Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton is in that movie. It's

907
03:28:39,959 --> 03:28:45,159
automatically... It's like Michael Keaton being in a movie is the same way I feel about when a car is

908
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:51,899
drivable in a video game. It becomes a full letter grade hire. I am sorry. That is... I will... I will

909
03:28:51,899 --> 03:29:09,180
take that all the way to the bank. Spider-Verse is better. If Spider-Verse is... I'm talking like

910
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:17,930
the Spider-Man MCU movies. Not... Into the Spider-Verse was great, but I'm talking live action

911
03:29:17,930 --> 03:29:32,280
Spider-Man. There was somebody on that. Spider-Verse was Sony Pictures. Yeah, but that... The amazing

912
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:43,290
Spider-Man one and two was also Sony. And yeah, you go back to the the Sam Raimi movies. That was

913
03:29:43,290 --> 03:30:09,000
Sam Raimi. That wasn't, you know, Sony. Easy, easy. Big one. All right. If Sam Raimi comes back and

914
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:15,399
does Spider-Man for the next Sony movie, maybe. We'll see. But that... That is not going to happen.

915
03:30:15,399 --> 03:30:42,600
You all know it. What is this thing? Ooh. Illegal? This one's illegal as well. This would be four

916
03:30:42,600 --> 03:31:20,250
for four. I'm... I'm losing money and I'm trying to gain a hundred, two hundred dollars. The article

917
03:31:20,250 --> 03:31:23,450
said that the director and Tom Holland is still going to be doing the next two planned Spider-Man

918
03:31:23,450 --> 03:31:42,790
films. They'll mess it up somehow. Not those two. You don't got all the other... You don't have all

919
03:31:42,790 --> 03:31:48,020
the other production in the Marvel Studios teams. Takes more than a director and an actor to make a

920
03:31:48,020 --> 03:32:11,510
movie. Is anybody on this? No. I want more Taskmaster. They have to explore more of these

921
03:32:11,510 --> 03:32:37,450
interesting characters. Mysterio was just one of those insanely interesting characters that I...

922
03:32:37,450 --> 03:32:52,420
I'm so happy that... At least that last one was Mysterio. It was fucking awesome. No, no, no, no,

923
03:32:52,420 --> 03:33:15,639
no spoilers. If anybody says a spoiler, they're fucking gone. This is a great character. I loved

924
03:33:15,719 --> 03:33:29,190
every second of that movie. Vulture... Vulture was... Michael Keaton, man. Like, God. I wanted...

925
03:33:29,190 --> 03:33:33,750
Hear me out on this one. When I found out that Michael Keaton was going to be in a Spider-Man

926
03:33:33,750 --> 03:33:40,709
movie, I shit my pants. I remember I was driving my car and I was just driving along and I was on

927
03:33:40,709 --> 03:33:47,750
the radio. There's just an Michael Keaton is picked to be cast as a villain in a new Spider-Man

928
03:33:47,750 --> 03:33:52,149
movie. And I was like, what the... And I just started... Yeah, there's nothing I could do about

929
03:33:52,149 --> 03:33:58,600
it because I thought he was going to be Carnage. I'm just thinking, imagine Michael Keaton,

930
03:33:58,600 --> 03:34:12,309
Beetlejuice, Carnage. Oh my God. I was so ready for that. Too bad. But he did a fantastic job as

931
03:34:12,309 --> 03:34:35,430
Vulture. This is my number one podcast. Hey, welcome to the cast. Hey, guys. Let me be the first to

932
03:34:35,430 --> 03:34:45,430
welcome you to my new series, the Comcast. As you see, we're using our fishing rod here.

933
03:34:48,649 --> 03:34:59,209
Welcome to the Comcast. We talk about movies, TV shows while we fish. If you have anything,

934
03:34:59,209 --> 03:35:02,489
any topic you want to talk about, anything that you got on your mind, throw it up there.

935
03:35:16,729 --> 03:35:21,450
All right. No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. This is important. You cannot do a minus two

936
03:35:21,450 --> 03:35:30,760
and then an LUL after that. Doesn't that contradict that minus two? Don't correct me here.

937
03:35:30,760 --> 03:35:54,040
I'm sorry. I don't think that matches up. Do I have enough money? Worse streamer on Twitch?

938
03:35:55,559 --> 03:36:09,579
Worse streamer? Really? Worse than like the dickhead that streamed porn? Worse than that?

939
03:36:23,770 --> 03:36:39,219
Yeah. How could you compare yourself? That stream was... I'm not even going to say it.

940
03:36:39,940 --> 03:36:43,700
I am not going to take this because I get arrested every time I'm doing it.

941
03:36:43,700 --> 03:37:11,770
Look at this. Yeah. How do I just end the day? I have an unlimited license here. End the day.

942
03:37:12,969 --> 03:37:19,620
I need money. End the day. End the day. How do I end the day?

943
03:37:26,459 --> 03:37:32,139
300 bucks is exactly where I was started with 20, 30 minutes ago. That's exactly where I was

944
03:37:32,940 --> 03:37:40,940
30 minutes ago. God damn it. Just pay. I need to catch five fish. I'm not going

945
03:37:42,489 --> 03:37:55,979
to keep any illegal fish. Promise. Sell old rods for cash. Sell old rods. Sell old rods.

946
03:37:56,620 --> 03:38:15,579
What do we got? Sell old rods. I gotta go home for this. Okay. Inventory. Home. Ooh,

947
03:38:15,659 --> 03:38:23,530
shit. Okay. Mini spin 800. Sell off a net. Yes, I do. Value spin 63. Done. All right. Let's go.

948
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:33,079
Rocky Lake. First time ever. We're getting there. Rocky Lake, Colorado. Travel for one day.

949
03:38:34,760 --> 03:38:45,209
Got my license. Let's go. I'm not going to spend anything. Okay. We got what we got here.

950
03:38:46,090 --> 03:38:50,090
Marshmallows. I have whisked crickets. All right. I'm going to get some bluegills.

951
03:38:50,889 --> 03:38:57,989
Colorado golden trout is crickets as possible. Anything else? What about... I need crickets as a

952
03:38:57,989 --> 03:39:04,870
much higher up on that list. Doe balls, crickets, crickets. I think we're going to go over here.

953
03:39:05,909 --> 03:39:30,579
Golden Shiner. This looks like a good place to start. What do you guys think? Don't write.

954
03:39:30,579 --> 03:39:42,010
Nobody write that. Okay. Now I've got my... Let's try it right here. Right off the rock. Look at

955
03:39:42,010 --> 03:40:00,840
this beautiful mountain, rocky Colorado. Fabulous nano spinner. Stop and go. Stop and go. What are

956
03:40:00,840 --> 03:40:05,159
your thoughts on the potential Disney theme Super Smash Brothers game? With the amount of

957
03:40:05,159 --> 03:40:09,239
shit owned by Disney, you could have Tom Brady versus Darth Vader versus Donald Duck.

958
03:40:11,799 --> 03:40:14,600
I mean, I've said from the very beginning that I think Scrooge McDuck would be a

959
03:40:14,600 --> 03:40:20,139
perfect addition to Smash Brothers. That move set is already there. I can already see it.

960
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:26,020
The issue is, didn't Sakurai already say, that they have to have originated on a video game

961
03:40:26,020 --> 03:40:33,290
console, right? But what a perfect addition that would be. And there it is. Bluegill.

962
03:40:33,930 --> 03:40:51,020
Sorry, I'll keep it. Nintendo and Disney hate each other. Where do you get that from? Tom Brady's

963
03:40:51,020 --> 03:41:01,129
special move is invoking Gronk, who spikes the enemy into the turf. I think at that point I

964
03:41:01,129 --> 03:41:06,250
would probably quit video games. That would probably be time. I would probably look at that

965
03:41:06,250 --> 03:41:10,969
and be like, I think I'm done with this. I don't think this is for me anymore.

966
03:41:11,770 --> 03:41:33,690
The lines are getting tangled. This is kind of a big one. I'm gonna like choke this guy.

967
03:41:35,610 --> 03:42:01,979
I just rip his head over. What is it? Whoa! All right, that's pretty good. Why do I think

968
03:42:01,979 --> 03:42:07,290
this guy cares? I'm just automatically assuming that everybody here is in chat.

969
03:42:07,850 --> 03:42:14,250
And look, look what I have. That's pretty good though. Oh, I do care. They say

970
03:42:15,540 --> 03:42:44,520
127 bucks. Pretty good. Let's get another one. That was a big cast, I know. Jesus Christ,

971
03:42:44,520 --> 03:42:51,799
fishing. I'm not sure if that's somebody coming in with a saying that, oh, I can't believe you're

972
03:42:51,799 --> 03:43:09,420
doing this or like, this is cold to me. I'll take it. 20 bucks. Oh, narrow spoon, small minnows,

973
03:43:09,420 --> 03:43:18,979
small cut bait. What's the biggest thing in this game? How do I get, I want to go on a boat.

974
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:35,860
Can I take out a loan? Jesus Christ, fishing. What? Hold on. Do you have a, you're doing two

975
03:43:35,860 --> 03:43:39,540
at the same time? What happens if you, if you catch one on there, you have to drop the one

976
03:43:39,540 --> 03:43:49,290
you're holding? Do people actually, do people multi-box fishing? I don't know if people did

977
03:43:49,290 --> 03:44:06,020
this. How many of these can you reliably do? That's kind of big. Let's see. That's all right.

978
03:44:06,739 --> 03:44:22,280
That's 0.28 pounds. Sorry. That's pretty good. Not bad. See, now I get to be the guy that has the

979
03:44:22,280 --> 03:44:47,110
cool rod. Here we go. Another one. This is a good spot. Don't lose it. Another big one. I want, dude,

980
03:44:47,110 --> 03:45:00,459
nothing can replace that like four pound fish that I caught. I think it was awesome. I took your name

981
03:45:00,459 --> 03:45:07,020
and wow, catch one fish for me to get it back. See, that's where you've already played yourself,

982
03:45:07,020 --> 03:45:11,579
unfortunately, because when was the last time you've ever seen me in a game, especially a

983
03:45:11,579 --> 03:45:18,620
multiplayer game, where German985 was my name? It's going to be like fucking Harold26.

984
03:45:34,620 --> 03:45:49,110
Do it quick. Take that one. Don't take that one. Don't take Harold26. That's my name. It's going to

985
03:45:49,110 --> 03:46:00,899
be my wow name. He's going to be, doesn't matter. I'll find it. I'll find another one right at the

986
03:46:00,899 --> 03:46:25,430
end. Got one. I just turned on like the developer console. Make your wow character for where they

987
03:46:25,430 --> 03:46:39,659
take all the names. I don't care about like the name of the character. It's okay. Did I lose him?

988
03:46:39,659 --> 03:46:57,420
I think I lost it. Oh, I was going to look. I want to see it. Nah, I'm doing this stupidly. Nah,

989
03:46:57,420 --> 03:47:08,200
just get it back in here. Okay. These are all 30 to 50 bucks each. I feel like that's all I'm

990
03:47:08,200 --> 03:47:15,500
getting over here though. I want to put on, why is it got a bunch of crickets? Different line?

991
03:47:16,299 --> 03:47:28,500
Can I not put a, shit, I have to use this. I mean, I'm catching stuff all over the place, but

992
03:47:28,500 --> 03:47:40,600
I want to put on that new bait. I took the hook off. This is the spinner rod, right? Am I going

993
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:45,459
to play Final Fantasy, the entirety of Final Fantasy? I'm not going to do that. I don't think

994
03:47:45,459 --> 03:48:11,479
so. Sorry. Stop that. Did that in one stream. Is there ever been an RPG I have considered?

995
03:48:12,870 --> 03:48:22,600
Uh, I guess I've technically played some RPGs on this stream. Not, I don't know. Have I ever done

996
03:48:22,600 --> 03:48:31,129
a turn-based RPG on this stream? I don't think I have. No, I don't think so. I think all the

997
03:48:31,129 --> 03:48:49,979
fish are gone here. I'm moving. I'm moving. I don't like this spot anymore. I'm going to go

998
03:48:49,979 --> 03:48:58,229
down here. All right. So I've been playing Fishing Planet for four hours.

999
03:49:01,319 --> 03:49:09,850
Now I'm just, this is just a, I'm liking this though, but okay. Trying to think about something

1000
03:49:09,850 --> 03:49:22,139
here. Hold on. Fishing Planet 2 incoming. I actually like this. I catch a big one. I did.

1001
03:49:22,139 --> 03:49:35,739
I got a huge one earlier. If you were here, you would have been like, what the fuck? All right.

1002
03:49:36,459 --> 03:50:07,420
I feel like this is a rubber band. What's going on here? Am I stuck on the weeds over here? Come

1003
03:50:07,420 --> 03:50:23,979
on. I would just swim over there and take it out. That's not that far away. That's right there.

1004
03:50:29,780 --> 03:50:55,450
What a dummy. I lost that. I lost that. That, that thing was expensive, wasn't it? Oh, fuck me.

1005
03:50:56,250 --> 03:51:01,639
That thing was like six or seven hundred dollars. All right. I'm, I need to go back to my house.

1006
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:06,200
Is this not going to, is it going to be a whole day? How long does it take to go back to your

1007
03:51:06,200 --> 03:51:23,799
house? You can fly from Colorado to Texas back to Colorado in a day. Okay. I'm good. I just got

1008
03:51:23,799 --> 03:51:30,440
this wave of craving in my brain. It just happened to this a second ago right now. Stuffed crust

1009
03:51:30,440 --> 03:51:44,309
Pizza Hut pizza. It just, it just deposited into my head. All right. Um, where is it? I got it back

1010
03:51:44,309 --> 03:51:51,129
to my home here. Take this off. Tele-float. Item can't be replaced with only item of the same type.

1011
03:51:52,969 --> 03:52:04,549
Tele-float. And then I'm going to put on the hook. Reel must be equipped. Okay. Relax. Where's my reel?

1012
03:52:05,110 --> 03:52:26,139
Let me spin. This looks kind of cool. Too heavy. Break the line. Now I want crickets. Must be

1013
03:52:26,139 --> 03:52:32,440
gripped first. All right. Tackle's too heavy and we'll break the line. What will break the line?

1014
03:52:33,079 --> 03:52:41,340
This is going to break the line? Two pounds. Here. Put this one on. There. You all right?

1015
03:52:42,139 --> 03:53:13,059
Crickets. Here we go. It's not sponsored. Sponsored. This game came out three years ago.

1016
03:53:13,940 --> 03:53:38,889
All right. I'm back guys. This time I got crickets. Looking for a different fish. I have, yeah. I've

1017
03:53:38,889 --> 03:53:51,780
gone fishing before. Plenty of times. It's an interesting thing for a minute. I get bored

1018
03:53:51,780 --> 03:54:02,340
really easily though. Here we go. First catch with the crickets. Ooh, this is new. What is this one?

1019
03:54:04,860 --> 03:54:34,090
Ooh, black crabby. You're out of current bait. I only bought one cricket. You buy one cricket.

1020
03:54:46,090 --> 03:54:57,620
What the fuck is going on? They're right here. What? 98. How do I put them into my backpack?

1021
03:55:03,059 --> 03:55:08,979
Why will they not go to my backpack? Why am I putting one? I'm putting on. I'm baiting one

1022
03:55:08,979 --> 03:55:16,920
cricket onto my pole and then putting that in a backpack and then going, like getting on a plane.

1023
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:21,319
Getting out of the plane. Taking the tackle out of my checked bag and everything. Doing that and

1024
03:55:21,319 --> 03:55:25,719
then leaving. Why would I do this? How can I not put this over here? I need, how do I bring more

1025
03:55:25,799 --> 03:55:46,299
than one? Bait. Cricket. Put it over there. Oh my god, you said to do that. Really? Oh, that stinks.

1026
03:55:50,260 --> 03:56:00,420
Well, whatever. Let's, I still have a day pass. It's $2,000 to do that. Did I seriously spend

1027
03:56:00,420 --> 03:56:38,889
$2,000? Did I spend $2,000 to go there and come back? Anybody here like crickets? Crickets. What

1028
03:56:38,889 --> 03:56:51,180
is a crankbait? Blood worm. Of course not. Nobody. Crickets. Nobody. What about the other side?

1029
03:56:51,819 --> 03:57:13,989
Well, that was Fishing Planet. Fun little game. Free. As you can tell, it's interesting,

1030
03:57:13,989 --> 03:57:19,159
roguelike. You can run out of money and you have to, you know, go back and try it again and start

1031
03:57:19,159 --> 03:57:27,239
kind of from the beginning. They'll hate crickets. They will. A cricket and a grasshopper are the same

1032
03:57:28,340 --> 03:57:38,760
bug. A cricket and a grasshopper. God just randomized the role between the two of them.

1033
03:57:39,079 --> 03:57:42,520
It was just like that you made a grasshopper and then you did the random button like 10 times.

1034
03:57:43,239 --> 03:58:01,739
They're the same fucking thing. One chirps like a bird. Big deal. That's like saying blue cheese

1035
03:58:01,739 --> 03:58:07,959
sauce is the same as blue cheese dressing. I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry, I fucked up.

1036
03:58:07,959 --> 03:58:20,620
FortniteJimmy is joining us again. That's a, I'm actually happy about that. Jimmy's back. I am

1037
03:58:20,620 --> 03:58:56,709
really excited about this. I can't wait to see what FortniteJimmy asks. Hi. Um, I can't.

1038
03:58:58,459 --> 03:59:27,139
Can I tell you guys something? I, I love this stream. This is like one of my favorite streams

1039
03:59:27,139 --> 03:59:41,530
in the last like two months. I am, I am very happy right now. Can I just tell you? I think for me,

1040
03:59:41,530 --> 03:59:48,329
best stream, like favorite best streams of all time. Sims 4 mod murder house. Fishing planet.

1041
03:59:48,329 --> 04:00:17,270
Close second. Nobody wants crickets. That's okay. Fishing is just outdoor gambling. It's really

1042
04:00:17,270 --> 04:00:22,469
strange that I know exactly what you're talking about. That's funny. That's weird. Yeah, it is.

1043
04:00:23,190 --> 04:02:48,420
Yeah, that's fair. They don't eat cheese either. You only get one? What's that even mean? Yeah,

1044
04:02:48,420 --> 04:02:52,260
I'm busy, but like I only get one though. But I'm here. I'm available for questions.

1045
04:02:53,299 --> 04:03:25,129
This is turning into a dad stream. I was going to take the cheese off. This isn't working.

1046
04:03:42,840 --> 04:03:47,559
Guys, this is not, this is not like a, like a 10 year old. All right. This is, I'm being

1047
04:03:47,559 --> 04:03:52,120
trolled right now. Why am I like, I'm like getting in my own head like, wait a minute.

1048
04:03:52,680 --> 04:03:56,920
I better like be, tell this person like, hey, it's like fun. Like just, I'm trying to like backtrack.

1049
04:04:07,430 --> 04:04:12,790
I'm like getting in my own. Wait a minute. Hold on, dude. Is this like, this person's following me

1050
04:04:12,790 --> 04:04:23,610
into service and talking about free Fortnite skins. This person's not real. I can't, you can't type

1051
04:04:23,610 --> 04:04:40,299
like that. And I couldn't type like that at nine. Yeah. This, yeah. That's okay.

1052
04:04:40,940 --> 04:04:54,170
Hey, you want to know how to respond to any, like any, doesn't matter what it is.

1053
04:05:00,090 --> 04:05:07,340
Damn. Damn. No, it's a kid. I can't, this is not even, this is a, this is somebody,

1054
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:15,850
this person's like 30. I'm fighting it. It's like, it's, it's faking me out. I'm fighting it.

1055
04:05:15,850 --> 04:06:17,500
I didn't, this is a troll. I'm being, I didn't just leave them. I'm being

1056
04:06:17,500 --> 04:06:20,940
fucked with right now. You guys have been, you guys have fallen for it.

1057
04:06:25,190 --> 04:06:30,569
You can never go back there. I can't go back there.

1058
04:06:30,569 --> 04:06:46,889
I didn't, I didn't answer any questions. I can't go back. I can't go back in there.

1059
04:06:47,530 --> 04:06:58,680
Okay. I'm going back. I'm coming. Okay. I'm back. Everybody can settle down. I got a good cover.

1060
04:07:32,100 --> 04:08:20,809
Okay. The internet cafe. I'm being trolled. He got lost in the realm.

1061
04:08:21,770 --> 04:08:44,790
He went to go pick up some herbs. Why did I leave them? How could I have done that?

1062
04:08:44,790 --> 04:11:49,979
I'll be right back. I'm going to go get a water. I keep laughing. I can't stop. I keep laughing at

1063
04:11:49,979 --> 04:11:58,059
just like the mom's MacBook, like overheating. And I just keep seeing this image in my head.

1064
04:11:58,059 --> 04:12:03,659
It is like the mom's MacBook overheated and like did it auto, like Intel shut down the computer,

1065
04:12:03,659 --> 04:12:12,139
you know, Intel has that shit. And I just see him standing there still for two minutes before

1066
04:12:12,139 --> 04:12:17,430
he just because he's gone, but he doesn't get disconnected yet. And he's just standing there

1067
04:12:17,430 --> 04:12:20,790
lost somewhere. And he just gets fucking disconnected. And it takes two minutes for

1068
04:12:20,790 --> 04:13:12,940
his portrait to disappear. I can't, I can't even, I can't even play this anymore. I can't play this

1069
04:13:12,940 --> 04:13:19,979
game right now. It's all, it's ruined. It's ruined for me. I can't play it.

1070
04:13:43,899 --> 04:13:46,059
Fortnite Jimmy 2010.

1071
04:14:07,370 --> 04:14:11,370
All right. I'm sorry, but if somebody comes into a fish game and asks me how to get Fortnite skins,

1072
04:14:11,370 --> 04:14:15,209
I'm going to automatically assume that that person is a viewer just trying to get

1073
04:14:15,290 --> 04:14:39,700
like onto my skin. Jimmy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jimmy, if you're watching. You're the only streamer

1074
04:14:39,700 --> 04:14:46,969
that's played this long enough to become a villain. You don't become a villain in a fishing game. I

1075
04:14:46,969 --> 04:14:55,030
just, I didn't do anything. I, all I said, I said, hey, I'm ready to answer questions. I'm busy.

1076
04:14:55,030 --> 04:15:00,579
But like, you know, I'll give one question for every, any person in the server. I'm not the bad

1077
04:15:00,579 --> 04:15:10,420
guy. I was answering questions. Then you left. Yeah. I said, I was like, Hey, good luck, man. I

1078
04:15:10,420 --> 04:15:25,450
got to go. Like what you got? I'm not allowed to leave a game. I can't leave. Uh, if I lacked

1079
04:15:25,450 --> 04:15:46,260
your lich gave $50. Jerma bullied Jimmy. He was just a kid, Jerma. You left him in the realm

1080
04:15:46,260 --> 04:16:08,840
where there were no fish to fish, no walls to wall run. I have to. Oh, God damn. This shit is

1081
04:16:08,840 --> 04:16:27,129
fucking ridiculous. Nice cast. I'm with Jimmy right now. What do you want me to say? Tell him

1082
04:16:27,209 --> 04:16:34,180
I'll answer any question. I got extra time. I got extra time on my internet cafe card

1083
04:16:35,180 --> 04:16:54,469
and I'm around. Now we can't just go back to fishing after this. Can we? I think maybe,

1084
04:16:54,469 --> 04:17:00,180
maybe if I'd like just go back to normal, I just need to go back to normal and get the cheese off.

1085
04:17:00,180 --> 04:17:07,340
I'm going to put some pet food on here. I'm going to go back to normal. I didn't do anything wrong.

1086
04:17:08,629 --> 04:17:40,100
I didn't do anything. I'm fishing. That's what a villain would do. He sent you a friend request.

1087
04:17:42,920 --> 04:17:47,559
Did he? Hold on. Wait a minute. Did Jimmy send me a friend request?

1088
04:17:56,329 --> 04:18:02,889
This is too many Fortnite characters. Too many Fortnite characters. All right. I'll take them

1089
04:18:02,889 --> 04:18:37,770
both. Are you happy? I'll take Kyle 2007 and I'll take Jimmy 2010. Sure. I'm going. Wait,

1090
04:18:37,770 --> 04:19:03,530
this is his whole profile. 2020, 2019. How do I leave this screen? Can I take his stuff?

1091
04:19:04,940 --> 04:19:18,540
What? No, I'm not trying to take his stuff. I can't leave the screen. There we go. All right.

1092
04:19:18,540 --> 04:19:22,459
We're going to, we're going, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go to

1093
04:19:22,459 --> 04:19:30,840
Jimmy and I'm going to say I'm sorry. Smotherim just gave $50. Thank you for the 50 bucks. They

1094
04:19:30,840 --> 04:20:00,600
say local streamer annihilates poor Fortnite kid in fishing game. No, I'm going. How do I join?

1095
04:20:00,600 --> 04:20:15,959
How do I join this game? All right. The fishery. I can just do it, right? I don't have $120. How

1096
04:20:15,959 --> 04:20:29,850
is it possible? Sell something. Sell one of these. $8. That's nothing. What? How much money?

1097
04:20:29,850 --> 04:20:33,690
I got it. I have enough money. All right. Quick, quick, quick. I have to save. I have to go say

1098
04:20:33,690 --> 04:21:49,540
what's up. I have $120. Okay. I think I'm in this one, right? What the heck? Where is he? Jimmy,

1099
04:21:58,020 --> 04:22:08,899
he's stuck in the realm somewhere. Is he in another room? That's the one. Let's go.

1100
04:22:16,809 --> 04:24:10,969
En1. The room is full. Why am I fucking 15 feet tall? Jimmy. He's lost in the realm.

1101
04:24:13,540 --> 04:24:37,059
Somebody left? No, there's nobody in this one. This is a new room. I feel like I just got to the

1102
04:24:37,059 --> 04:24:43,639
end of an RPG dead end. Wrong room, Jim. Find Jimmy before it's too late. Oh, fuck. I gotta

1103
04:24:43,639 --> 04:25:24,010
turn around. Shit. Whatever. Oh shit. Five minutes left on the internet card. I don't have much time.

1104
04:25:24,010 --> 04:25:30,250
No, I can't just... I can't just like go PM. No, I've got to like just... Hey, I got five minutes

1105
04:25:30,250 --> 04:25:37,350
left on my internet card. Just checking the rooms. Just checking the realms and see what's

1106
04:25:37,350 --> 04:26:48,760
happening in each one. What do you mean PM? No. What? Come on. What? He went into a different room.

1107
04:26:51,459 --> 04:28:30,139
He went into another realm. Okay, we'll go. I'm fine. Yeah, I think people are weird. Don't worry

1108
04:28:30,139 --> 04:29:27,579
about that. Damn it. The fucking coffee pasta. I can't. I've done. I just want to say hi.

1109
04:29:33,639 --> 04:29:37,159
I don't know because people have... I don't know. Some people are fucking nice.

1110
04:29:38,180 --> 04:29:52,059
Why is... That's very easy. I gotta like... I don't know. I'm just nice to everybody. I think

1111
04:29:52,860 --> 04:30:11,479
being... I'm just nice to everybody. I don't think... I think I just try to be nice. I just try. I just

1112
04:30:13,750 --> 04:30:21,510
try to be nice to everybody. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Because that's true. That's just true.

1113
04:30:21,510 --> 04:30:25,430
I don't matter. I just try to be nice to everybody. That's just... That's a true statement.

1114
04:30:28,059 --> 04:30:36,180
All right. I've closed the book. I've closed it. Oh, my internet cafe card.

1115
04:30:36,819 --> 04:31:09,739
Jimmy. I'm just a huge fan of Fortnite. It's a little rude, I think.

1116
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:19,659
I talked to them earlier. I did, which I did. I did. That's true. I talked to them earlier.

1117
04:31:19,659 --> 04:31:22,860
Remember we were talking about like, oh, look at my fish and look at your fish. What's the contest?

1118
04:31:31,639 --> 04:31:37,639
All right. It's been fun, Jimmy, but I've got to go. Okay. Yes. Okay. Everything's fine. We're all

1119
04:31:37,639 --> 04:31:42,420
done. You're a nice guy. Thank you. Hey, thanks. It was... It's been a pleasure. My internet

1120
04:31:42,420 --> 04:32:16,340
fucking cafe time is up. The ding went off. Okay. I... Get out. I don't want... This is... I don't...

1121
04:32:16,340 --> 04:32:21,299
I'm gone. I didn't... I'm... That's it. I just said, I have a great time in the game. It was

1122
04:32:21,299 --> 04:32:59,059
fun. It was nice to meet you. Have a good day. Goodbye. I just want to fish. I can't block them.

1123
04:32:59,700 --> 04:33:03,989
All right. That was... That was interesting. Okay. Let's go back to playing the game.

1124
04:33:11,060 --> 04:33:15,459
That was... That was... You know what? Yeah, that's right. That was two grown adult men.

1125
04:33:16,340 --> 04:33:29,959
How much? I have zero dollars? Oh my god. He knows you're online. Yeah, but I'm just... That could

1126
04:33:29,959 --> 04:33:46,330
be any... That could be online, but not... In fact, you spent all your money stalking this person.

1127
04:33:46,330 --> 04:33:56,330
No, I'm just trying to... My internet... My internet card's up. All right. That's it. Thank you. If I

1128
04:33:56,330 --> 04:34:06,490
liked your glitch for the $50, you better hope to have Google Fiber in prison. Why? What are you

1129
04:34:06,490 --> 04:34:24,939
talking about? What does that mean? Look, I just want to fish. I just want... I just want to fish.

1130
04:34:24,939 --> 04:34:30,250
I want to fish. I'm just gonna... I'm going to the basic fishing zone. I'm gonna fish.

1131
04:35:20,810 --> 04:36:59,939
Can I do this? Let me see. It's 160 coins to change your fucking name? What? This is why I

1132
04:36:59,939 --> 04:37:07,939
don't enter in-game chats. I never do either. And I was pressured to answer questions from the chat

1133
04:37:07,939 --> 04:37:31,430
room. This one. This is an in-game chat right here. Fortnite Jeremy. You have to quit streaming.

1134
04:37:31,430 --> 04:38:59,860
Did I just... Wait, did I just PM him? Why did somebody write that? Uninstall the game.

1135
04:39:08,040 --> 04:40:13,479
Ugh. I'm staying. Terrible. What a shitty internet cafe. I'm fucking crying. Fishing planet.

1136
04:40:15,880 --> 04:40:24,380
Why would you pay to do this? Good to see you. Bye. Yeah, it's my turn on the VC. We got a lot of

1137
04:40:24,380 --> 04:40:45,959
them. I just love Fishing Planet. You just left your coat and leave all your stuff. You play Fishing

1138
04:40:45,959 --> 04:40:51,509
Planet for like six hours at an internet cafe and you leave all your stuff on a chair? Where were

1139
04:40:51,509 --> 04:41:17,479
you going? It's staying logged in. Yeah, you're still logged in as you... No, it's an internet

1140
04:41:17,479 --> 04:41:35,830
cafe. They have like the internet cafe account. God, that's fucking ridiculous. My fucking head

1141
04:41:35,830 --> 04:41:55,529
hurts. That was fucking... That was unreal. I'm gonna do put some bread on now. What the hell's

1142
04:41:55,529 --> 04:42:20,459
going on? How's Cox? Cox is doing actually pretty good ever since they fixed it. Flying pixels,

1143
04:42:20,459 --> 04:42:33,340
thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. What did they do? Their service is just awful,

1144
04:42:33,900 --> 04:42:48,119
unfortunately. I went away for three hours and the stream looks exactly the way it did.

1145
04:42:50,090 --> 04:43:11,619
Yeah, because not much has changed. Did I get anything? Did you ever wake that guy up?

1146
04:43:11,700 --> 04:43:18,580
Oh shit. Lewis Cheese, it's time for you to wake up. Lewis Cheese,

1147
04:43:20,540 --> 04:43:26,229
wake up. I hope you didn't miss your appointment because this is three and a half hours late.

1148
04:43:32,500 --> 04:43:46,549
I did it already. You can change your reeling speed. Oh yeah, I know. You can do slow. You can

1149
04:43:46,549 --> 04:44:11,400
be fast. Come on. Let me catch one fish for the first time in an hour. There it is. Got it. Another

1150
04:44:11,400 --> 04:44:30,520
thousand pings for Lewis. Oh god, my head is fucking killing me.

1151
04:44:54,330 --> 04:45:00,810
This is worse than the Labo streams and the Birdhouse streams. Somehow I disagree. I'm not

1152
04:45:00,810 --> 04:45:27,669
sure why. This is cozy. This has been a cozy stream. I'll be live tomorrow too. Tomorrow we're

1153
04:45:27,669 --> 04:45:51,430
probably gonna play Maximum Action. I missed it? What? Yeah, it is a constant conflict game. You're

1154
04:45:51,430 --> 04:46:19,380
right. How long is Maximum Action? Is it more than two or three hours? Or is it a quick game?

1155
04:46:19,380 --> 04:46:40,979
It's long, right? Long enough. I could probably do a whole stream on it, right? What's the best

1156
04:46:40,979 --> 04:46:47,029
fish I've ever eaten? A piece of king salmon from an Italian restaurant in Boston. And I don't

1157
04:46:47,029 --> 04:47:08,150
remember the name of the restaurant because I'm stupid. That is true. Yeah, I wish I remembered.

1158
04:47:08,150 --> 04:47:12,790
It was one of those scenarios where I was with my family and it was like, oh, let's go out to this

1159
04:47:12,790 --> 04:47:21,819
place and just kind of blend it together with everything else. The thing is, though, a lot of

1160
04:47:21,819 --> 04:47:27,930
those, a lot of Boston restaurants, especially the, they can have not only very similar menus,

1161
04:47:29,779 --> 04:47:36,419
but there's a ton, especially in the north end. There are so many Italian restaurants that it's

1162
04:47:36,419 --> 04:48:05,259
this, this probably hundreds of them. Oh, who is that in the distance? Well, somebody on the server?

1163
04:48:10,950 --> 04:48:29,400
Look to your left. This fishing man 62. He's just playing the game. Oh, I'm keeping it.

1164
04:48:38,709 --> 04:48:46,729
That, that, that crept up so fast. I couldn't stop it. Oh, yeah. I wish I knew this menu.

1165
04:48:46,729 --> 04:49:12,470
Why did I not know that there was a Metal Gear Solid menu? Pet food. Who uses cheese to fish?

1166
04:49:12,470 --> 04:49:29,830
A lot of people. It's used a lot. Talk to fishing. No, I'm no longer speaking in this chat. I'm just

1167
04:49:29,909 --> 04:49:45,720
guy playing video game. Is it the game's feeling eerie? That's because it's covered in smoke.

1168
04:49:45,720 --> 04:49:52,119
There's like a whole fog over everything. That's just like, that's just scary. It's scary. That is

1169
04:49:52,119 --> 04:50:08,569
a scary trope. This is illegal. I'm going to release it. I'm not getting in trouble. I don't

1170
04:50:08,569 --> 04:50:32,759
have any money. Why do I have so much? I have 198 pieces of cheese. Why do I have all this? This is

1171
04:50:32,759 --> 04:50:45,900
too many. Can I sell it? Can I get market value for this? Another illegal fish. Don't think so.

1172
04:51:09,130 --> 04:51:15,130
He's here. He's here. You know how many versions of Fortnite Jimmy I've seen in this chat? There's

1173
04:51:15,130 --> 04:51:52,419
like four of them. Five hours. What am I going to eat for food after this? Please press T. All right,

1174
04:51:52,419 --> 04:52:10,490
let me try that. It's been 5 a.m. the whole stream. 2 p.m.? Am I going to do this? What about all the

1175
04:52:10,569 --> 04:52:39,540
people in here? I guess I just can control time. This actually looks really nice. It's client

1176
04:52:39,540 --> 04:53:34,729
side. Idiot. No! What? Hey, what? No, no, no. No, no, no. Why am I being? Oh, no. Why is it doing this?

1177
04:53:34,729 --> 04:53:39,959
Say you're sorry. You don't know the controls. No, that's assumed. That's assumed. I'm like the

1178
04:53:39,959 --> 04:53:53,750
third person at this point. Can I get a manager? I don't understand. I'm trying to talk to people

1179
04:53:53,750 --> 04:54:03,619
and I'm just PMing this random Fortnite person. Oh, no. What the fuck have I done? What the fuck?

1180
04:54:03,619 --> 04:54:41,340
Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Wrong message. Sorry. Easy. Easy. Easy. That's like very simple. Easy.

1181
04:54:41,340 --> 04:54:59,860
How do I get out of this? No, no, no, no, no. No. No, I just was like, I was wrong. That would make

1182
04:54:59,860 --> 04:55:15,619
no sense. What did I just take? Not like, oh, sorry. Like, that was my wrong message. I was

1183
04:55:15,619 --> 04:55:19,299
sending it. Like, oh, sorry. Is it? Sorry. Out with everybody. That's the wrong message very clearly.

1184
04:55:24,709 --> 04:55:39,669
I'm just nice to everybody. Why do I have to message Jimmy again? I was trying to prove

1185
04:55:39,669 --> 04:55:46,759
somebody wrong in chat and they were right. But, uh, German sucks. Thanks for the five community subs.

1186
04:55:48,680 --> 04:56:03,369
Thank you. No, it's not the same person. It's not the same person. Like, oh, I was the wrong

1187
04:56:03,369 --> 04:56:07,290
message. I'm just another person at the internet cafe. I'm just another person. Don't you guys

1188
04:56:07,290 --> 04:57:21,340
understand? Like, I don't know who that person is. Asking for bits. Why did I have to fucking type?

1189
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:28,250
I said, didn't I specifically say I'm not writing in an in-game chat ever again? And look what

1190
04:57:28,250 --> 04:58:18,020
the fucking happened. Look at what happened. I messaged the Fortnite troll person. He's in

1191
04:58:18,020 --> 04:58:24,389
chat right now. Well, then he'll know that I'm streaming from an internet cafe. It's really

1192
04:58:24,389 --> 04:58:41,220
loud in here. Fucking really, really loud in here. Hey, sorry. I'm sharing a space with

1193
04:58:41,860 --> 04:58:45,299
like two or three different, like three people that way and like five people that way. There's

1194
04:58:45,299 --> 04:59:04,680
like another 20 people in the other offices down here. I'm looking back. All these computers are

1195
04:59:04,680 --> 04:59:28,380
doing a good, they're all playing, we're all playing the same game. Hey, easy. Quit dropping

1196
04:59:28,380 --> 04:59:31,979
glasses back there. We all have to share this space, you fucking asshole.

1197
05:00:31,500 --> 05:00:36,060
Hey, hey, easy. It's just a game, man. You don't get to smash the computer.

1198
05:00:38,939 --> 05:00:42,299
We all lose them sometimes. You can't catch the big one every time.

1199
05:00:49,099 --> 05:00:49,599
Thanks.

1200
05:01:17,500 --> 05:01:28,979
Thanks for watching, Jimmy. You can see my time is almost up. My time's up now? All right.

1201
05:01:28,979 --> 05:01:55,990
Oh wait, sorry, I forgot. There's still people here. There's still people here.

1202
05:01:56,630 --> 05:02:05,849
I'm sorry.

1203
05:02:24,180 --> 05:02:49,029
Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I get another 25 minute card, please? Yeah, here, over here.

1204
05:02:49,029 --> 05:02:58,840
Meet number 42. That's not, that's, that's, I don't know why you played flute at me. I guess

1205
05:02:58,840 --> 05:03:06,680
that's a sign of a place when you call the person over to come over and ring you up.

1206
05:03:08,599 --> 05:03:28,950
Okay, so I'm over here. I'm over here. Please come over to me.

1207
05:03:36,150 --> 05:03:43,669
Thank you. I'm over here. My God, I need, how many? Yeah, thank you. Yes. Yeah, I got, I've,

1208
05:03:43,669 --> 05:03:52,650
it's a visa. I'll take one 20 minute. Yeah, I want a 20 minute. Thanks. Actually,

1209
05:03:52,650 --> 05:03:56,250
it's a, I want, give me two of those. Yeah, just keep going.

1210
05:03:59,130 --> 05:04:10,680
Yeah, maybe grab a 45 minute too. Yep. Another one. Thank you. Thank you. I'll take, that's my,

1211
05:04:10,680 --> 05:04:29,110
my card. Let me scratch off the back. Oh, good. This is, this is a 20 minute one. Yeah,

1212
05:04:29,110 --> 05:05:00,599
this is what I asked for. Let me just punch the code in real quick. Thank you. Fortnite Jimmy's

1213
05:05:00,599 --> 05:05:08,650
dad gave $50. Are you the guy that's harassing my son? Stop playing in that cafe. Oh God,

1214
05:05:08,650 --> 05:05:16,090
get out of here. Well, I hate to tell you, Fortnite Jimmy's dad, you could, you didn't have to give me

1215
05:05:16,169 --> 05:05:22,790
$50 to say that. Screw, you could have read the, the, the info down there. It was 250 for me to

1216
05:05:22,790 --> 05:05:56,409
read that. Okay. I need to relax. I'm going to fucking die. I'm going to pee my pants.

1217
05:06:14,700 --> 05:06:35,799
All right. Really? How many, how many fish do I have? Did you lose 600 viewers for that joke?

1218
05:06:37,819 --> 05:06:46,169
I don't know. Probably something like that.

1219
05:06:51,189 --> 05:07:01,779
They thought the stream was over. That's true. You know, it probably is. I'm going to be

1220
05:07:01,779 --> 05:07:15,430
real. It's probably, it probably is. Fortnite Jimmy's dad, another $50, a hundred dollars.

1221
05:07:15,430 --> 05:07:21,380
Fortnite Jimmy's dad. I know you heard my car streamer consequences will never be the same.

1222
05:07:22,020 --> 05:07:48,599
That's a mean thing. Thank you for the a hundred bucks though. For real. I've been making a lot

1223
05:07:48,599 --> 05:08:10,680
of fucking old man noises. Caught any big ones. I did. I need to get some bait. Man, you guys are

1224
05:08:10,680 --> 05:08:18,549
fucking hilarious. That happens sometimes. Sometimes a stream will happen where some of

1225
05:08:18,549 --> 05:08:22,869
the shit that you guys are doing and saying is it just, it just does it to me and it fucking throws

1226
05:08:22,869 --> 05:08:29,590
me off. And you guys are hilarious. Like seriously, I just, yeah, I aged like 30 years in the last 10

1227
05:08:29,590 --> 05:08:47,180
minutes. I think this is going to be the end of the fishing trip though. I actually laughed myself

1228
05:08:47,180 --> 05:08:56,779
into a migraine. I have a headache now, like a bad one. There's too much stim, like too much

1229
05:08:56,779 --> 05:09:14,279
stimulation in my brain. Oh, but yeah. I will see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for joining me.

1230
05:09:14,279 --> 05:09:19,860
This stream really, yeah, that, that's, how do you go from here, right? It's been over five hours.

1231
05:09:19,860 --> 05:09:22,659
I'm gonna do the bits. It'll probably be about five or six hours. That's, that's, that's good.

1232
05:09:23,220 --> 05:09:39,819
I'll be live tomorrow. My goodness. I will see you guys tomorrow for Maximum Action Fishing Planet.

1233
05:09:39,819 --> 05:09:48,310
It's a fun, yeah, it's a fun game. It's a solid 6.7. It's, it's fun. It's just, come on. You can

1234
05:09:48,310 --> 05:10:09,659
sit here and relax and pretend to be at an internet cafe. Hey, special thanks to Fortnite,

1235
05:10:09,659 --> 05:10:18,840
Jimmy. Hope you have a wonderful rest of your in-game time. My time is up right here. I will

1236
05:10:18,840 --> 05:10:29,400
actually for real see you tomorrow. Stick around for the bits if you want to. Maximum Action tomorrow

1237
05:10:29,400 --> 05:10:46,520
same time, probably around like three-ish p.m., three to four. As always, see you soon. Thank you

1238
05:10:46,520 --> 05:10:53,560
for watching. We are going to go back to a little bit earlier. We had 250 from Gnarly.

1239
05:10:54,439 --> 05:11:00,459
So when are you going to come visit? I'm available this Friday if you want to come over for lunch.

1240
05:11:01,099 --> 05:11:16,569
Uh, for lunch? Sure, yeah, then there's another one from Gnarly. Also, by the way, very excited

1241
05:11:16,569 --> 05:11:20,090
for the carnival stream. Thanks for working so hard putting it together. I hope I can watch it live.

1242
05:11:20,650 --> 05:11:24,889
I hope you can too. I hope as many people can, that's why I just, like I said, September 21st,

1243
05:11:25,930 --> 05:11:30,889
trying to get as much time for people to realize if they can go or if they want to participate or

1244
05:11:31,529 --> 05:11:34,889
they're going to be around for it. It's, I believe that's Saturday or Sunday 21st.

1245
05:11:39,560 --> 05:11:49,799
Should be a lot of fun, a lot of time, a lot of work is going into it. So I'm as excited as you

1246
05:11:49,799 --> 05:11:56,139
for real. Thank you Gnarly for the five dollars. Appreciate it. Uh, Shalashka, thanks for the 250.

1247
05:11:56,139 --> 05:12:02,380
You're an actor. Do you have any tips on memorizing something in your own way? The easiest way to

1248
05:12:02,380 --> 05:12:09,319
memorize lines is to have somebody else do them with you because instead of just staring at a

1249
05:12:09,319 --> 05:12:17,799
paper, you take the paper away and they have the paper and can correct you. It's much more fluid,

1250
05:12:17,799 --> 05:12:22,279
it's much more, it's much easier to memorize something when you're not the one staring at

1251
05:12:22,279 --> 05:12:40,599
the paper. Then they steal your part. That's not how it works. What is the carnival stream? The

1252
05:12:40,599 --> 05:12:50,040
carnival stream is going to be a twitch controlled stream. There are going to be a series of large

1253
05:12:50,040 --> 05:12:55,080
robots who chat is going to control to play carnival midway games throughout the day.

1254
05:12:55,959 --> 05:13:17,029
On the 21st of September, mark it on your calendar. Should be a lot of fun. Can we physically be at

1255
05:13:17,029 --> 05:13:24,229
the carnival? No. No. There's going to be, I thought about like, oh maybe have people there.

1256
05:13:25,669 --> 05:13:30,310
When you have something like that with, I'm not saying that anything here is going to be dangerous,

1257
05:13:30,310 --> 05:13:37,990
but legally and liability speaking, I don't want anybody that's not part of this production

1258
05:13:37,990 --> 05:13:46,279
to be on this set with machines that are able to, with big machines, you know what I'm saying? I

1259
05:13:46,279 --> 05:13:50,919
don't want anyone to have any, that's just not something I want to do. Is it going to be free?

1260
05:13:50,919 --> 05:14:04,200
Absolutely. It has nothing to do with how dangerous the machines are, but the functions of the

1261
05:14:04,279 --> 05:14:09,740
machines. You know, if somebody somehow touches one of them or, because they're going to be

1262
05:14:09,740 --> 05:14:14,779
engineers here, that they're responsible for them. I would never want a scenario where somebody,

1263
05:14:15,500 --> 05:14:20,299
I don't know, think about any scenario where somebody would touch it or fall onto it or

1264
05:14:20,299 --> 05:14:24,139
trip or grab it or try to take a picture with it or something. You know, I just, you got to be

1265
05:14:24,139 --> 05:14:33,340
careful and I don't want any of those scenarios to ever be a possibility. How are you controlling

1266
05:14:33,340 --> 05:14:53,209
the machines in chat? Good luck. What does it take to get word out that said twitch controlled

1267
05:14:53,209 --> 05:15:02,299
stream is going to take place? Well, I've been talking to Twitch and they seemed

1268
05:15:02,299 --> 05:15:14,939
seemingly somewhat preliminarily interested in maybe, they're not working on it or anything,

1269
05:15:14,939 --> 05:15:19,099
but I went back and forth a couple times with some of the people there to see if they, if

1270
05:15:19,099 --> 05:15:21,740
anything wanted to happen from it or if they wanted to do something with it or,

1271
05:15:22,299 --> 05:15:32,680
but nobody at Twitch is like working on this project at all. Yeah, something like maybe grab

1272
05:15:32,680 --> 05:15:37,240
a front page slot or something possibly, maybe I'm going to see if it's available. That's another

1273
05:15:37,240 --> 05:15:43,319
thing. I don't know. We'll see. I can't say that anything like that will or will not happen,

1274
05:15:44,200 --> 05:16:01,770
but it might be interesting if it is. How many viewers is it going to get? I have no idea.

1275
05:16:02,810 --> 05:16:10,709
That's something that I cannot give you a prediction of. I would say, yeah, I would say

1276
05:16:10,709 --> 05:16:25,959
at least four. Hey, deep fried Gundam. Thanks for the 250. They say been stressed out about

1277
05:16:25,959 --> 05:16:30,599
my future due to recently graduating college, but your streams always help me relax and

1278
05:16:30,599 --> 05:16:35,000
to not lose my shit. Love you, Jermbo, despite your garbage cheese takes.

1279
05:16:36,279 --> 05:16:39,720
Garbage cheese takes. I just wish cheese I think is the best. That's what they're referring to.

1280
05:16:41,240 --> 05:16:47,259
But no, any time, graduating college is a huge change because it's one of the first times in

1281
05:16:47,259 --> 05:16:55,700
your life where you're not sort of in schooling for the most part. Most people that go to college,

1282
05:16:55,700 --> 05:16:59,700
you know, you typically do K through 12 and then maybe you take a year maybe,

1283
05:16:59,700 --> 05:17:08,790
or maybe you go right into college and it's a huge change. So it is like a big turning point

1284
05:17:08,790 --> 05:17:24,009
in a lot of people's lives, right? I mean, when I graduated college, it was, it was kind of scary.

1285
05:17:24,009 --> 05:17:33,529
It was because you just, you've never known that before. So, okay, it's time to do something.

1286
05:17:34,330 --> 05:17:40,250
And what that is, I don't know. You look around for jobs, you try to find something that you're

1287
05:17:40,250 --> 05:17:43,770
good at or that you think is interesting, that you really care about at least a handful of things.

1288
05:17:44,569 --> 05:17:58,360
But hopefully over time and over, you know, months, years, whatever it takes,

1289
05:17:59,319 --> 05:18:01,240
try to get something going, try to do something.

1290
05:18:03,159 --> 05:18:18,540
People usually fall into something somehow. What did I do after college? After college,

1291
05:18:19,659 --> 05:18:27,590
I kind of went right into, I'm going to do video stuff. And that's where the wedding video stuff

1292
05:18:27,590 --> 05:18:35,349
came from. I just was a freelance video maker. And oh, you, you're a friend. I know a friend

1293
05:18:35,349 --> 05:18:41,830
that's getting married. Hey, I'll do your wedding. I can do that. And then that person told a friend

1294
05:18:41,830 --> 05:18:46,549
who was getting married and that person told a friend and I kind of worked off of just complete

1295
05:18:46,549 --> 05:18:59,020
word of mouth and that was it. I did not have a professional setup. I had a really nice camera

1296
05:18:59,020 --> 05:19:02,299
and obviously I had, I thought the skill is necessary to be able to cut stuff like that

1297
05:19:02,299 --> 05:19:07,819
up together and people thought they were good. I got a lot of good comments of, hey, that was

1298
05:19:07,819 --> 05:19:10,939
really well put together. Thank you. We, we loved it, you know, whatever. And you just

1299
05:19:10,939 --> 05:19:14,060
work off of that. That's kind of what I did for at least a couple of years.

1300
05:19:19,270 --> 05:19:25,830
And I also substitute taught. I was like a substitute teacher. I did teacher's aid stuff.

1301
05:19:33,430 --> 05:19:46,200
Teacher noise. Yeah. I was, I was kind of all over the place until I really started to put,

1302
05:19:47,319 --> 05:19:51,080
because when I started that YouTube channel, it was just, I just did it because I thought it was

1303
05:19:51,080 --> 05:20:06,330
fun. That was it. I didn't really have very many expectations on it. And that's kind of how I've

1304
05:20:06,330 --> 05:20:13,299
kind of fallen into this is just kind of just keep going. It just worked out. If I did not,

1305
05:20:13,299 --> 05:20:17,860
if I was not a streamer or a YouTuber or anything, if I wasn't doing this and putting all the time

1306
05:20:17,860 --> 05:20:26,729
into it, I probably would have continued to do, I probably would have gone into education. I

1307
05:20:26,729 --> 05:20:31,849
probably would have. And I know like that, I know, hold on, you would be a teacher.

1308
05:20:33,029 --> 05:20:37,349
I don't know. I think about that. I really like computers. I really like games. I really like

1309
05:20:38,150 --> 05:20:54,619
talking to people. It would be some, I would find something to do even being in just in a,

1310
05:20:54,619 --> 05:21:04,439
like a school system or something. Right. I probably would have fallen into that somehow

1311
05:21:12,790 --> 05:21:16,869
or customer service because I remember we talked about the fishing trip. I just,

1312
05:21:17,189 --> 05:21:30,279
I just talk. But thank you Tingy for the 250. Since you're talking about streaming stats,

1313
05:21:31,000 --> 05:21:34,279
I want to bring to your attention that you are no longer a top 1000 streamer.

1314
05:21:35,159 --> 05:21:44,490
What do you mean? You are a top 500 streamer. What are you talking about? Top 500?

1315
05:21:51,930 --> 05:22:15,369
Twitchmetrics.net. That for real? These real stats? 400, number 400. Hold on a minute.

1316
05:22:16,330 --> 05:22:24,090
Number 447 most watched. That's top 500. Number 42 most watched English variety channel.

1317
05:22:25,130 --> 05:22:40,419
Guys, that can't be correct. That's top 50. What? This is not like a, like a edit source,

1318
05:22:40,419 --> 05:22:44,439
right? Like this is a real website, right? You did, you're not just like giving me like an

1319
05:22:44,439 --> 05:23:07,860
edit source with a thing. No, no, but that's on my end. All right. Let's go. Top 500. Damn. All

1320
05:23:07,860 --> 05:23:16,659
right. I'm going to, I can't wait to tell my mom. No, I don't, I don't get there without people

1321
05:23:16,659 --> 05:23:38,470
that watch this channel. This is you guys, not me. See if we can break top 100. We'll see. I don't

1322
05:23:38,470 --> 05:23:44,040
know about that. But anyways, yeah, no, thanks. Thanks for watching. Thanks for being here. Thanks

1323
05:23:44,040 --> 05:23:50,360
for getting this channel even in like, even the top thousand, top 5,000, top 2,000. That's

1324
05:23:50,360 --> 05:23:54,360
still a fucking huge deal. That's a big deal to me and a big deal to this community. So for real,

1325
05:23:57,509 --> 05:24:09,590
peak viewers, I believe that's just for the month. Yeah. If I was a day, you'd be number one.

1326
05:24:09,590 --> 05:24:21,099
That would be impossible. But yeah, thanks. We'll check back in on it in another six months. See

1327
05:24:21,099 --> 05:24:30,389
where it is. Lewis Cheese, $10 from Lewis Cheese. Thanks for waking me up and for the new alarm

1328
05:24:30,389 --> 05:24:37,029
sound. You're welcome. Whatever you woke up for, hopefully you got it done. Whatever it was. Thank

1329
05:24:37,029 --> 05:24:45,880
you for the 10 bucks and good morning. Hey, Lobotomized Teddy Bear, thanks for the 250. Here

1330
05:24:45,880 --> 05:24:52,439
is a stream idea relating to fish. Eat Fugu puffer fish, but you have to cut it and eat it on stream.

1331
05:24:53,000 --> 05:24:55,880
You have to cut it and eat it on stream. It's a great idea. Nothing could go wrong.

1332
05:25:01,049 --> 05:25:05,689
No, I don't care if it's honestly, I would never eat that even if it was prepared by the most

1333
05:25:05,689 --> 05:25:27,110
talented chef in the world. I would not do a mini F. That's 58 drop frames in five and a half hours.

1334
05:25:27,110 --> 05:25:37,290
It's pretty good. I think we're back to normal. Yeah, great. Great stream idea. What's the next

1335
05:25:37,290 --> 05:25:51,139
one? Hey, I got a great stream idea. Roll around in cactuses. It'd be fun. I think I will abstain,

1336
05:25:51,139 --> 05:25:58,310
but thank you for the 250. Thank you Gnarly for the 250 again. How come whenever you do an

1337
05:25:58,310 --> 05:26:03,720
impression of someone, you start by saying, let me tell you something. Is it a voice acting technique

1338
05:26:03,720 --> 05:26:14,889
or just a habit? I don't know. They call those cadences. I guess that's one of mine.

1339
05:26:15,849 --> 05:26:26,779
Mannerisms, cadences. Let me tell you something. Hey, let me tell you something. Yeah, you're right.

1340
05:26:26,779 --> 05:26:32,459
Hey, let me tell you something. I think what that is, it's a way to tell the audience,

1341
05:26:33,419 --> 05:26:39,270
here comes a joke in my somewhere without me even being aware of it.

1342
05:26:48,970 --> 05:27:05,529
Maybe. Or it's a this is somebody else talking. Minus two incoming. Probably something like that.

1343
05:27:05,529 --> 05:27:15,380
Hey, feel 64. Thanks for the five dollars. I am glad you like fishing planet. It was fun playing

1344
05:27:15,380 --> 05:27:23,610
with you. Thanks for the recommendation. I did do the one guy in chat. It turned out to be a very,

1345
05:27:23,610 --> 05:27:28,009
very fun stream. So thank you. Feel 64 for the five dollars. The game is fun. It is.

1346
05:27:34,229 --> 05:27:40,389
Phylacter Lich gave $9.11. Sir, I'm going to need you to see how many fish you have.

1347
05:27:40,389 --> 05:27:45,430
Well, what do we have here? Someone's going to streamer jail. Oh, okay. I get it.

1348
05:27:59,750 --> 05:28:04,790
Thank you, Phylacter. And thank you for the 420, the four subs and then 20 subs,

1349
05:28:04,869 --> 05:28:13,029
community subs earlier. Thank you. Invader Z. Thanks for the 250. Hi, German. I was wondering

1350
05:28:13,029 --> 05:28:17,590
if you chose the carnival to be on the 21st because you sang the song September poorly once

1351
05:28:17,590 --> 05:28:27,689
or is that a coincidence? There's a 100% coincidence. Just happens to be on the same

1352
05:28:27,689 --> 05:28:41,159
date of my favorite song ever. I mean, it was just a coincidence. Thanks for the 250. Stinky

1353
05:28:41,159 --> 05:28:44,680
Beavers. Thanks for the 250. Hey, everybody. German here and welcome to a coffee commentary

1354
05:28:44,680 --> 05:28:57,400
of Justice in Doom. I remember those. I remember thinking that the ironic, like,

1355
05:28:59,319 --> 05:29:05,000
doom thing. I was doing like the ironic, like of doom thing. I don't think anyone

1356
05:29:05,720 --> 05:29:10,119
knew that. I think I just thought I was actually saying that, but I was.

1357
05:29:14,169 --> 05:29:19,479
You guys know what I mean. Like, oh, it's me of doom. Ha ha. It was like a meme for a while.

1358
05:29:20,439 --> 05:29:24,520
Yeah, yes. The Penguin of Doom, right? That was a meme for like a while, like 10 years ago.

1359
05:29:25,880 --> 05:29:39,130
Yeah, that's an old one. Surprising how more of you guys know what that is.

1360
05:29:48,599 --> 05:29:54,540
But thank you for the 250. Hey, Smelly Boy. Thanks for the 250, Smelly Boy. Put Fortnite

1361
05:29:54,540 --> 05:30:11,819
Jimmy in the next germ rumble. He deserves it. FlyingPixels. Thanks for those five community

1362
05:30:11,819 --> 05:30:17,700
subs earlier. I'm not sure I got them. Techno Rift. Thanks for the $14. Thank you, Techno Rift.

1363
05:30:19,000 --> 05:30:22,119
This has honestly been one of the most entertaining streams you've had in a while,

1364
05:30:22,119 --> 05:30:26,279
from the fishing escapades to the father-son fishing bonding experience.

1365
05:30:27,000 --> 05:30:31,639
Oh, I also got all these bits from watching like 500 ads for the last few months. Keep up the good

1366
05:30:31,639 --> 05:30:40,330
work. Well, I thank you for giving those to me. That seems like a lot of time spent watching ads.

1367
05:30:40,330 --> 05:30:52,090
Thanks for the $14. Really appreciate that. And it was a fun one. I had a great time. This was a

1368
05:30:52,090 --> 05:31:01,979
very, very fun stream for me. Thank you C4G for the 250. My girlfriend is watching this stream on

1369
05:31:01,979 --> 05:31:06,939
their PS4. And you were so audibly upset when you accidentally DM'd Jimmy again,

1370
05:31:06,939 --> 05:31:21,900
that someone came in to check if they were okay. Wait, what? Wait, they thought that they were in

1371
05:31:21,900 --> 05:31:34,500
there going like, no, I don't want to play. Jesus. Like, the person's being like beat up.

1372
05:31:35,220 --> 05:31:39,509
Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to type it. I don't want to type to that person.

1373
05:31:40,310 --> 05:31:46,900
It's like, is everything all right in here? Like, is there like a swarm of bees in your room?

1374
05:31:46,900 --> 05:32:12,439
What's going on? Oh, there's a wasp in your room. There's always a wasp in my room. But thank you

1375
05:32:13,000 --> 05:32:19,990
C4G for the 250. Everything's fun. Everything's good. Hey, Squibble, thanks for the $5. This is

1376
05:32:19,990 --> 05:32:23,349
probably the most activity fishing planet has ever seen. Thanks for the stream, dude.

1377
05:32:24,229 --> 05:32:29,700
Maybe somebody can play it and we'll like, yeah, this is actually a pretty fun little game.

1378
05:32:30,659 --> 05:32:39,130
Whatever, play it. It's just a game, all right, to play. That's a message from the dem.

1379
05:32:43,189 --> 05:32:48,259
But thank you, Squibble. I'm going to get the credits on the screen. We're going to get to the

1380
05:32:48,259 --> 05:32:53,939
end of the bits. Here they come. Special thanks to all of the new subs, the resubs, the community

1381
05:32:53,939 --> 05:33:05,049
subs, all of you. See y'all tomorrow for maximum action. That one's going to be a gamer stream.

1382
05:33:05,939 --> 05:33:14,180
So yesterday was like an on-camera like dickhead stream. Today was a relaxing fishing stream.

1383
05:33:14,180 --> 05:33:19,299
Tomorrow is going to be a gamer stream because that's a skill-based video game.

1384
05:33:20,340 --> 05:33:32,360
This was relaxing. I was relaxed. You can't tell me the first four hours of the stream wasn't just

1385
05:33:32,360 --> 05:33:45,380
hanging out and relaxing. It was. We talked about cheese. We talked about prosciutto.

1386
05:33:46,099 --> 05:33:52,520
That's all I remember. We had four and a half plus hours of conversations on this stream and

1387
05:33:52,520 --> 05:33:58,840
I only remember that somebody told me that I was wrong when I say the prosciutto is raw or something.

1388
05:33:58,840 --> 05:34:03,880
That's all I remember. Talked about the MCU and Far From Home is the best Spider-Man movie.

1389
05:34:05,080 --> 05:34:08,919
I remember writing that in the true true true true true true true true true true true true true.

1390
05:34:08,919 --> 05:34:33,689
That's all I saw over in the chat. But thank you everybody. Thank you snoozingcopter for the 250.

1391
05:34:33,770 --> 05:34:37,689
Oh my god Jeremy. I finally found you. Remember me? We were fishing together but then I got

1392
05:34:37,689 --> 05:34:41,290
separated from the group and fell into the pond and couldn't get out. I screamed for help but

1393
05:34:41,290 --> 05:34:46,569
nobody heard me. This game was more fun than I remember by the way. I feel like it's fun

1394
05:34:46,569 --> 05:34:53,000
just to open and play a game for a while. Yeah that's what I'm saying. Yeah that's right snoozingcopter.

1395
05:34:54,119 --> 05:35:00,490
Thanks for the 250. If I liked your elixir thanks for the five dollars. That was one bad mad dad.

1396
05:35:01,130 --> 05:35:11,189
Thank you. Thank you Sergio but for the 250 to be honest. Oh so no so be honest. Did you choose the

1397
05:35:11,189 --> 05:35:18,380
21st night of September intentionally for the carnival stream? I'm being honest it was I didn't

1398
05:35:18,380 --> 05:35:26,619
even pick that date. I gave a range of time and we sort of went back and forth on when it would be

1399
05:35:26,619 --> 05:35:35,220
and the 21st turned out to be the best day for everybody. So yes by coincidence.

1400
05:35:37,139 --> 05:35:47,509
Hey orange power thanks for the ten dollars orange power. Ten bucks. Hey Jeremy I've lived in Texas

1401
05:35:47,509 --> 05:35:55,590
all my life and I'm actually transferring to a college in New York for my sophomore year. I'm

1402
05:35:55,590 --> 05:35:58,470
actually really nervous about being in such a different environment from the one I've been in

1403
05:35:58,470 --> 05:36:05,189
all my life but your streams always give me the break I need. Keep it up. You keep it up as well.

1404
05:36:06,069 --> 05:36:15,000
That's a big change. I've never really been in New York for very long but the times that

1405
05:36:15,000 --> 05:36:19,560
I have spent there it's a pretty interesting place. A lot of cool stuff to do. A lot of cool

1406
05:36:19,560 --> 05:36:23,720
stuff to see in New York especially New York City. Not sure exactly where you'll be in New York

1407
05:36:26,299 --> 05:36:36,979
but good luck. I'm sure you do just fine. True Bostonian. He's never been to New York.

1408
05:36:36,979 --> 05:36:51,459
I have a few times. I have. I've been to Times Square but thank you orange power. Whatever you're

1409
05:36:51,459 --> 05:37:03,700
doing. Whatever college you're going to. Keep it up as you said to me. Finally Wolfgang 6789 gave

1410
05:37:03,700 --> 05:37:10,500
five community subs a few minutes ago. Thank you Wolfgang. And the last bit message of the night

1411
05:37:10,500 --> 05:37:18,650
250 from Colusia. Colusia thanks for the cozy stream. Now I can sleep peacefully. Have a great

1412
05:37:18,650 --> 05:37:26,150
night. Good night. Apologize to my cat who you terrified. I'm really sorry to Dubsky dude's

1413
05:37:26,150 --> 05:37:44,150
cat and whoever I scared from the werewolf. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great night.

1414
05:37:47,000 --> 05:38:32,169
Take care. Talk soon. Like tomorrow.
