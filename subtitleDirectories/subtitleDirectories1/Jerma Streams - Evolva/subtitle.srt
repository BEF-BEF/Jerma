1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,089
You guys even counted down. You counted down and I got it right at the exact second I went to 12.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:15,380
It was like three, two, one, bang, live. I'm not even here yet. Give me my two minutes that I have

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:23,269
in solidarity while I just sit here and breathe deeply and get ready and talk into my mirror

4
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:29,260
that's right here on the left side of my screen. You're gonna do this. It's gonna be a good stream

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:01:25,060
today. You're gonna knock it out of the park, Jeremy. Give me a minute. All right, I'm back.

6
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:37,719
Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you are. Today we're gonna play Evolva which I it's who

7
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:46,739
knows. This could be a home run or this could be a foul ball. What do you mean foul ball? Because

8
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:57,109
if I don't like it we're gonna pivot to something else. It's not an immediate strikeout. Strikeout

9
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:05,079
would mean that the stream turns off. No. I have another one lined up and I don't want to say what

10
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,509
it is because that's the problem I have with these streams. Whenever I have a backup game

11
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,469
and I tell everybody what the backup game is, all of a sudden it's like do that instead. No,

12
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,500
no, no. Just don't even play this. Let's do that. Please do that. So I'm not going to tell you what

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,580
the backup game is. You'll know what the backup game is if we need a backup game, okay? No,

14
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,860
it's not a sir's wrath. I'm sorry to all the people that hate me now because I'm not going

15
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:41,189
to play that. I do have something to tell you though. Something important. It is the official

16
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:53,189
date and the official time of FTK, Favor the King, Minecraft. I've got a real date for you

17
00:02:53,189 --> 00:03:04,629
and a time. It is going to be September 13th at 3 p.m. Pacific. It gives everybody that's involved

18
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:13,990
across all the many time zones to get it put together. I'll give you some very brief details.

19
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:21,740
Detail number one. You don't have to be a multi-sub to be there anymore. You just have to be an

20
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:32,789
active sub. That's it. Nothing else. It is not what you think it is. It's not the same game

21
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:41,240
that has been completely reimagined and completely redesigned. You just have to be a current

22
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,990
subscriber to the channel. The server is going to be shit like last time. No. The problem with last

23
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,590
time was there was only one or two servers that were handling all the traffic. This time,

24
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,379
there's a lot. I think there's like 10 servers that are handling all this.

25
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:24,790
Make it 20. Listen to 100 gecks. I already did. What do you want me to do? Do I have to watch 100

26
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,089
gecks at the beginning of every stream? Is that like a routine? Is that like my new starting soon

27
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:37,930
screen? It's going to be, oh, we're going to watch 100 gecks starting soon. Thanks at my starfish

28
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,509
for the five community subs. I'm a little winded. I ran up and down the stairs like four times

29
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:52,040
as I wanted to be exactly on time at exactly 12 o'clock. So I went like up, up, up, down, down,

30
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,879
down, down, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,

31
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,680
where's my keys? Where's my phone? Where's my phone? Phone, phone, phone, get my phone.

32
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Shit. No, I've got to get a water. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

33
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,120
water. Okay. Poor quick. Get up there. It's 1158 up, up, up, up, up, up. Wait. Hold on.

34
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,279
Where's the dog? Oh, top. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, get like up the stairs. Oh, top.

35
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,189
Looking for a watch up. No, no, I see you. You're right there. So I, I, I like exercised

36
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,269
like five to 10 straight minutes before I turned this on. So I'm, I'm a little winded.

37
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,240
It's okay. He lives in a mansion.

38
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:34,519
No, it's just one small staircase. But when you go up and down at like 30 times in five minutes,

39
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:43,910
you get, you get a little disheveled in an eight story house. No, I would never want to

40
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,550
live in an eight story house. You know how much that would suck? I don't want to live in a big

41
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:58,519
ass house. No, fuck that. That would be horrible. It would scare the shit out of me. And every noise

42
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,920
I heard would be a person in the house. Somebody could live in your house. If you had like 12

43
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,279
bedrooms and your house was like 15,000 square feet, somebody could literally come live in your

44
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,740
house and you wouldn't fucking know they were there. They could just sleep in one of the bedrooms.

45
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,579
And when they heard you come and just hide in like the closet, Oh, okay. He's gone. Like you

46
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,100
have so much food in your fridge that you can't even tell if one guy's eating like fucking Cheerios

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
out of your pantry or not. Nobody would even know. No, forget. No, no, I'm not doing that.

48
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm never having 12 fucking rooms. They could like jump from room to room and it would be like

49
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,019
playing hit man without killing anybody. You're just trying to sleep in their beds. No, not

50
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:53,000
happening. Get out. That's just a sitcom. All right. Anyways, anyways, anyways, anyway, we're

51
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:07,670
going to play Evolva. This is going to be either a POG champ or a frog damp. Who knows? Oh, come

52
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:15,189
on. That was not that bad. Like damp versus like POG. I'm taking that one. I deserve it.

53
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:20,490
I deserve that one. I ate my fucking vegetables last night. I deserve at least a plus two for

54
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:38,470
that one. Let's go. You just made a new saying. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Everyone's getting a bit

55
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,189
mad because this game's not in like 16 by nine. There's no widescreen for this game.

56
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,759
So it just doesn't exist. Unfortunately. So it's stuck in a four by three window. There's no

57
00:07:50,759 --> 00:08:00,459
widescreen patch. I already looked. Ready? All right. Here we go. We're going to do a new game.

58
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:09,060
Hopefully it's not too loud. For this game, you get a team of Power Rangers or whatever they are.

59
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:18,410
You get to make your team and they all evolve with the course of the game. It's too ugly. Oh,

60
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,480
please. You've watched me play a PlayStation one game on this channel with like a cell phone

61
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:30,600
quality image. I think you can handle this. We have an agile, a speed, a heavy and an intelligent

62
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:44,950
purple alien. Yeah, come on, man. This is purple alien from the fast germa and purple alien saga.

63
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:56,379
Can I do purple alien? Okay. It's going to be purple A for purple alien speed type. Oh,

64
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,620
I can change the color. Wait, doesn't have to. It doesn't have to be purple. It can be anything

65
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:15,830
I want. All right. Well, should it just still be purple alien? P alien. Yes. Okay. Fine. Purple A

66
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:24,389
or P alien. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. All right. This is the agile. This is the speed one. This

67
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:43,740
can't be fast germa. They can't do that. Make this Sonic. This team sucks already. Purple alien

68
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:55,000
Sonic. This is not beanbag Sonic. This is like smushed with an anvil Sonic. Like smashed head

69
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:14,899
in car door Sonic. Car door Sonic. This is going to be CD Sonic. CD Sedonic. No, CD Sonic. Come on.

70
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:24,940
Do I really? This is the heavy. This was, I think this was doing all the damage. I want to be able

71
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,110
to, I think you have to really be able to differentiate between them. So we're not going

72
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:40,070
to have all the same color. Make him the Hulk. If I make him the Hulk, you mean like a makeshift

73
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:54,889
shitty fourth grade Hulk costume. Like the big kid in class. All right. Big kid Hulk. I'll have

74
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:05,049
abbreviations before. All right. This is big kid Hulk. And then this is the intelligent one.

75
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:19,590
Which is absolutely it's going to have to be me. Jeremy E. There we go. It's like I'm filling out

76
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:35,960
an application. Fast germa. Evil Jeremy. No, what color? What color should I be? Red. Well, green,

77
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:51,750
blue and purple already taken. I have to be teal. Aqua or chrome. Red. I have to be red. Yellow.

78
00:11:51,750 --> 00:12:03,240
Is yellow. Can I even do yellow? Yellow doesn't exist. I should be chrome. Okay. Like a chrome.

79
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,639
I'll be like metallic or something. No, I'm just going to be red because I will lose track of who

80
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,919
the fuck is who. That looks good. All right. Name of the team is Gino team. That's not going to work.

81
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:28,710
What should it be called? We've got P, Alien, CD, Sonic, BK, Hulk and E. Jeremy. Just the family.

82
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:46,730
My family. Imagine that's your superhero team name. My family. It's going to have to be my family.

83
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:59,659
My family. My family rocks. The Incredibles. No, my family. Here we go. And I was this. The probe has

84
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,820
detected planetary debris indicating biomatter entering. Okay, I'm not going to try that hard.

85
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,789
You know, what do I have to do that for? The probe has detected planetary debris containing

86
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:14,379
biomatter entering the X-92 system. Untact with the debris was lost when it entered the atmosphere

87
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:21,740
of planet X-92-3. Twelve hours later, the probe recorded a significant increase in seismic activity

88
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,580
analysis. Did I tell you guys this story, how I used to do that to my mother? She'd be reading

89
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,779
me a story and she'd be reading like that and every time she would nod off, I would kind of

90
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,480
nudge her a little and she'd go back to where she was. Happened all the time. She'd be reading

91
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:44,440
me a story in bed and I would have to, she'd start to nod off and I would go like just nudge

92
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,330
a little and she'd go as if I was powering her back on. I was like turning my mother back on with

93
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,860
zero battery with an iPhone. She would turn on, I would see the Apple screen and then immediately

94
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:03,590
would shut off and I would fucking be like annoyed. All right, what are we doing? Briefing. Deploy

95
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:10,179
your team of geno hunters. Absorb sufficient indigenous wildlife to adapt to the environment.

96
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:16,950
Locate and assimilate any non-indigenous biomatter to for aid further analysis.

97
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:24,230
Use the O arrow on your compass or objective to find your way to the objective. Attack dead

98
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,580
creatures to absorb their meat. Mutate your geno hunters using the genes and the meat

99
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,750
to give them a new ability. Use the new ability to gain access to the previously inaccessible area.

100
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,549
This is a metroidvania? And a genetic sample from any non-indigenous life form by mutating

101
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:55,000
your geno hunters. Get all remaining geno hunters to pick up point. I promise. What did I promise?

102
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:08,620
I can't alt tab. Somebody explains to me. Tiny cut scene. That's the littlest cut scene. I can't

103
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,600
alt tab. What does it tell me what it says? I'll crash the game. Tell us the skeleton radiation

104
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:26,759
story. Oh, right, right, right. Hold on. I will after this small screen. So this is us. This is

105
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:50,259
my family. Are we going to earth? Is that earth? It looks like earth. But we send down an avocado pit

106
00:15:50,259 --> 00:16:17,419
that turns into my family. Pretty accurate, I guess. The whole stream like this. The reason why this

107
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:27,460
cut scene looks like this is because this is back in like 2002. It's dodge. Holy shit. Can I get one

108
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:38,679
of those on my team? Those things are awesome. It's the most insane reaction ever. It's because all

109
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:48,379
games in 2002 had like a 240p rendered full motion cut scenes. Use the O on your compass to find the

110
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:55,220
objective. Do I have to control everybody? This different, this two or three different cameras

111
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:03,960
down there. All right. I feel like this is a multi-block stream. This really is what it's like to

112
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,799
play WoW with multi-blocking. Can I select other people? Oh, there's a punch. I just punched somebody.

113
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:28,950
Hold on. First of all, this is so loud. It's just, I found my calling in life. It's this.

114
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,240
It's just to listen to this over and over again. All right. I was supposed to turn it down, not up.

115
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,440
Okay. Mouth sensitivity. That's fine. Okay. I'll tell you the, the, the, okay. So I had a nuclear

116
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,539
bone scan, which if you don't know what a nuclear bone scan is, they put a small amount of radiation

117
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:58,039
into your body and you go into this camera that looks like a jokey x-ray vision video game machine

118
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:03,960
where if you put your hand under it, after getting this tracer put into you, you can see your hand

119
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,779
like a cartoon underneath it. And I looked at the images afterwards and it was the most ridiculous

120
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:20,869
thing I've ever seen in my life. My entire skeleton as naked as I could possibly be was just every

121
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:28,579
angle of my body, every angle of my skeleton. And I want to show it on stream. I don't have these

122
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:35,880
images yet, but is that like term, is that TOS? Cause that would be me, the ultimate in me showing

123
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,720
you my naked body on stream. Is that TOS? That's what's under my clothes and what's under my skin.

124
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:57,930
So it's only when the skin is on top that it's TOS, right? Is that how that works? And muscles.

125
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:06,549
Yeah. Whatever. What about your penis bone? It's done. You got it out of me and it hadn't even been

126
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,819
20 minutes. Okay. Let's go show it. I'll show it when I get it, but it was ridiculous.

127
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:23,130
It was one of the most weird kind of, is there a gun? Who has a gun? Somebody's shooting a rifle.

128
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,069
All right. We're going to go. How do I select other aliens? Or do they just walk behind me?

129
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:36,759
Okay. I have a punch. We eat these eggs. All right. Eat these, eat these, eat these eggs.

130
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:49,690
Why do I feel like this is three of you guys just waiting for me to do? Hey,

131
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:58,730
do not punch him. What do I do with those? Wait, that doesn't listen. It was the objective this

132
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:10,660
way. I feel like I should be able to eat these things. Can I? Oh, the objective is like right

133
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:20,599
here. Oh shit. It's down here. Okay. Okay. I can't control these guys. I cannot control the other

134
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:32,839
three chat members. They have their own camera. Okay. Just don't stand over there. You see,

135
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,700
if this was really chat, one of you would have died by that. One of you would have died. I'm

136
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:46,279
surprised it wasn't me. All right. We have to find the first mutator. There's no way we're going to

137
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:54,230
be able to get through that. We're not going to be able to do this. Can I switch? Does somebody

138
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:13,269
else have like a power? Don't get that close. Use the fast one. Oh shit. Faster. No, no, no.

139
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:27,420
Don't follow me up here. Oh, dead creature. Who should get the first power up? Big kid Hulk for

140
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:43,859
sure. All right. Good. What did that do? We level up. Mutate. What happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

141
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:52,630
whoa. What happened? He gets a jump. What? He just changed. He can change to be green.

142
00:21:55,269 --> 00:22:05,220
Greener. Did we make him greener? Okay. He's. Wait, he has a jump. Oh, he has a jump now. He

143
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:18,970
didn't have one before. Oh shit. What are we doing? Oh my God. I don't know what I'm doing to him.

144
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:29,700
Okay. Stay there. Don't move. You can stay there like that. Use new ability to gain access to the

145
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:39,660
inaccessible area. Oh, his jump is huge. I get it. Okay. What about everybody else? Can I mutate you?

146
00:22:40,220 --> 00:23:06,710
Okay. That's what you're. I think it's a bigger jump for everybody. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

147
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:17,130
What do you mean? What am I wasting points? Am I giving everybody? I'm just making everybody.

148
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:25,240
I'm just changing everybody's color. Okay, so we're good. Now we should be able to go.

149
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,750
Should I jump something? Oh, I can jump this now. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't

150
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,589
come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Nobody come down

151
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:53,880
here. Just leave me. Leave both of us. What the fuck? Wait, they're doing this on their own.

152
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:59,539
Gain a genetic sample from any non-indigenous life form by mutating your geno hunters.

153
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:06,970
If you find. What did that say? Oh, we can just go this way. We're fine. Where's the other guy?

154
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:19,140
Oh, there he is. Okay, we're good. I hope we can start growing like weird toes and stuff.

155
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:28,279
The other guy actually made the jump. Wait, what the hell? We didn't already do this.

156
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,609
We all have to get together for this. Oh, oh, hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

157
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:49,940
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Wait, I can't make this fucking.

158
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,059
Nobody can make this jump. No, we can't make the jump. I need to mutate more to get more jump.

159
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:11,339
Okay, good. Is that working? This is the only spot where I can make this jump, isn't it?

160
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:35,430
Jesus, come on. What the fuck? I don't get it. I don't get it either. I think that's doing it,

161
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:41,589
right? Why are you playing it? Because it seems like it's fun. Hold on. I get it.

162
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,859
No, stay over there. This is a chat member. This is one of you guys just being like, dude,

163
00:25:51,859 --> 00:26:01,049
it's wicked easy. Just do it. Get over here. Do you think it's so easy? I'm taking control

164
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:17,750
of your body. Stay up there. Stay. Oh, my fucking God. Damn it, dude. Stay. Where's the fast one?

165
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:26,599
Give me fast germa. Where is he? Two. Oh, are we actually all the way down here? No, I don't

166
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:36,700
do this shit again. Wait, can I? Is there a way I can go up to not have to go through the explosions

167
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:46,259
anymore? Your family sucks. Stop. I just got to get the hang of it. Look, you can grow like big

168
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:57,529
horns and have like big asses and stuff. You guys are going to be all over this. Wait, what was that?

169
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:12,650
Shit, I have to go through this whole thing again. I have to. I'm going to get the hang of this.

170
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:33,140
Somebody's going to die and it's going to be wicked embarrassing. OK, I have the jump, but

171
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:42,099
I can't make it. Why can the computer make it? This point right here. That point right there.

172
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:56,539
Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Move. Get back here. Got it. OK. Do it. What's wrong

173
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:04,220
with you two? Come on, number four. Let's go. All right. Fucking leave him. Who cares?

174
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,839
Has he not been mutated to make the jump? Oh, shit. He wasn't mutated to make the jump. OK,

175
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:27,690
I get it. All right. Come on. This is your family. I don't all come down here. Was I supposed to be

176
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:46,740
down here? This too. Come on. What happened? I fell in a fucking hole. Whatever. I can do it.

177
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,940
I'm just going to go and fuck it. Who cares? I'm going to get there. I didn't. I didn't know. I

178
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,380
didn't know. I turned. There was a hole right there. I didn't see the fucking stupid hole.

179
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:08,950
All right. Where is this indicator pointing? Just start killing. Come here. What are these things?

180
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:28,740
Get up. Get up. Number three. What are you doing? What happened to number three? Wait, why is number

181
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:38,500
three just standing still and being exploded? What is he doing? He's on his own. He's so slow.

182
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:52,500
All right. Any more mutations? Oh, this is a new one. What is this? Nothing. What is this?

183
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:01,400
Nothing. I guess we're going to do this one. What does that do?

184
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:15,210
It's making the jump better. Usually it has an animation. Oh, wait. It is making the jump

185
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,730
better. You're right. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait. That's the problem I'm having. All right.

186
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,920
You have to accept it. It is making the jump better, isn't it? Cool. All right. I'm going

187
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:36,220
to forget to evolve one of these people and they're going to be worthless. How about you? All right.

188
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:50,680
We all have the better jump now. I like fast Jerma. Plug in their audio jacks. I don't really

189
00:30:50,680 --> 00:31:04,019
know what that's supposed to mean. It really wants me to be over here. Why? Oh, give me the big kid.

190
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:23,980
We all do this at the same time? Help me do this. I need more power. Are you kidding me?

191
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:38,059
We need to like kill more stuff. All right. There was those other two monsters. All right.

192
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:56,539
Give me fast Jerma. What does it blink on one? You should role play an E3 trailer with three

193
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:05,059
other aliens. This is not going to happen. I'm sorry. Come on. We need to eat another monster.

194
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:20,329
I need to kill something. I hear something. Hold on. What about down here? What does the shift do?

195
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,859
Okay. What does that do? Figured it out. I know what to do. I know what to do. Follow me. Follow

196
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:50,599
me. That's a super punch. Are you kidding me? Shit. Wait. What about the big guy? God damn it.

197
00:32:50,599 --> 00:33:03,099
All right. We have to eat more stuff. What about jumping? Can we jump on something? Next game. No,

198
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:15,380
not yet. Not yet. This is very important. We have to get to the first boss. Yeah. There are bosses

199
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:29,750
on every level. We just have to find something else to eat. Found it. Get it. There's so much

200
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:41,369
food down here. Holy shit. There's food everywhere. Come on. Get over here. Please. We just need to eat.

201
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:51,900
Eat. Give me the fast one. What's the point of using anybody else?

202
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,180
Everybody can level up. This is different. This is what? Run speed? I lose jump, but I gain run

203
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,380
speed. This is more jump. Run speed. For sure. Absolutely. Let's go. All right. What about you?

204
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Run speed or higher jump? Run speed. Give everybody run speed. Don't do anything else.

205
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:38,780
Eat more. Yeah. I got to level everybody up though. Ready? Let's move. So much better.

206
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:55,659
All right. Kill everything and we're going to eat all these. Holy shit. Okay. Kill. Fight.

207
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:03,500
Why do I have to do everything? Just fight. What did I just do? I said G. What did G do?

208
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:31,860
Okay. We need to be able to punch through the wall. More speed? More speed. More speed. This is a

209
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:38,309
shitty survival game. We have to give all these games at least 40 minutes. Don't you understand?

210
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:48,730
How long it's been? 36. We've got 10 minutes. Give me the fast one. Go.

211
00:35:53,539 --> 00:36:03,019
Actually, we have way more than 10 minutes. I'm sorry to say everybody. What's that? Are we

212
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:24,980
throwing rocks? We can't get in this shit. How are we not strong enough? All right. Whatever.

213
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:40,579
I need more speed. No, I need more power. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help.

214
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,539
Help. Help. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Where is everybody?

215
00:36:46,019 --> 00:37:05,909
Is three okay? Oh, there he is. Okay. He's just slow. This is an MMO grinding.

216
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:15,079
No. Is it? Yes. This is multi-boxing. Wow. It's fine. We can run with that. It's okay.

217
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:35,900
That's a lot of juice. What do I do with the juice? Mutate. Oh, this gave tux. This gave tux.

218
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,219
Fucking claws. Even I can't pretend that it was cool. I'm sorry. I tried.

219
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:52,260
I want to get... What do I do? This is going to be... Yeah. Claws. Give him the claws. What else?

220
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,900
More claw? More claw. What else? More claw. More claw. Bigger claws. What else?

221
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:07,559
Even more claws. What else? Bigger claws. As big as your arms. What else? Do it again.

222
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:20,090
What else? Do it again. Are we doing this? Get all remaining geno hunters to pick

223
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:25,750
up point. All right. What do you have now? I don't want you to close. I want you to speed.

224
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:38,539
Now he's too powerful. That's fine. I can definitely break those rocks now. What's this?

225
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,420
Yeah. I'm the one dickhead in your friend group that has thunder fury

226
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,139
and the rest of you just get to walk around with them. It becomes exhausting to play with this

227
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,579
person because they kill everything in one hit and you just, you use it as a time for you to

228
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:02,519
hang out with them. You're not playing well. You're just watching somebody else play while you walk

229
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:17,769
around. Here we go. And there's random encounters. Sign me up. Do I give everybody

230
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:26,869
claws? It's a really good character. All right. I need to actually build a good team here. We need

231
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:41,909
tank, DPS, healer, and friend of healer. Okay. Good. You stay that way. I don't want you to change.

232
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:51,369
This is the fast guy, right? We don't want claws on fast guy. We want fast guy to be fast guy.

233
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,820
That's pretty fast. We don't need claws on you because look, you can be the one that runs around

234
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,070
fast. What about you? Wait, I'm doing this all wrong. The heavy, the heavy should have heavy weapons.

235
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:10,840
All right. We'll give you heavy weapons too. We'll have two DPS. This guy is the guy that's

236
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,219
supposed to be doing all the damage. All right. That's good. That's good. Good. Leave him alone.

237
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:24,010
It's two different claws. Faster or more damage. Yeah. Good. And now what about you? This is

238
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:30,550
intelligence guy, right? He's growing leaves out of his body. All right. We're going to make

239
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:41,960
intelligence guy. We'll give him some damage and give him some speed. Let's go. He's literally

240
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:48,500
making shit up. I don't see at least a hundred pogchamps from that. That was fucking awesome.

241
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:22,309
Hey, friend of healer. Can you make me 20 waters? Oh, sure. Thanks. Now what? Oh, we're up top now.

242
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:31,239
Cool. All right. What is it? Oh, get all the, get them all to the pickup point down there.

243
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:47,219
I don't want to go down here if I'm not supposed to be. Yep. This is it. God, I love the two FPS

244
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:55,659
boxes. I guess that they serve a purpose, but that purpose is a little weird because

245
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:06,940
how, shouldn't I be able to toggle that? What does one do? Don't you think this is something

246
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,579
that's an interesting thing to toggle and not something that's on the screen all day?

247
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:30,309
Playing wow again on stream. We can all make that jump. Where's red? Red. All right. Just like me.

248
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:43,579
One, two, three. Good. Keep on. Where's number one? Here he is. He's fine. We got to make this

249
00:42:43,579 --> 00:43:30,219
jump. Don't fall in. All right, let's go. Right behind you. Right behind him. Shit, I fell down.

250
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:37,860
I'll be up in a minute. Okay. We'll be up here. Just wait for me. Don't come down here. Don't come

251
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860
down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Don't come down here. Thank God they jumped.

252
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:50,519
Just switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switch to somebody that's not stupid. Okay. All right. We

253
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,980
lost our leader. It's okay though. I'll do my best to. Need heels here. Need heels. I'm out of

254
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:04,090
mana. Need heels. Where are you supposed? Hey, where am I? Do you guys know where I am?

255
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:10,199
I don't know where I am. I'm in the water. I don't know. I don't know, dude. Just get up here. We're

256
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:16,489
almost there. We're almost there. Can you guys make this jump? I don't have wings of justice.

257
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:32,170
All right. You make the jump, dude. Just go for it. Yes. Nice. I don't know where I am. I'm still,

258
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:37,539
I'm still in the water. I've still, I got out of the water about two years ago.

259
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:47,320
I'm in the water. It's okay, dude. Don't worry. We got you. Need help to me, to me, to me, to me.

260
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:56,980
I got two. I got two. Fucking idiots. I have two. Come on. We're on our way. And I'm going to die.

261
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,500
I'm going to die here and that's fine. I'll fucking take it up with the guild leader later.

262
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,139
This is like, this is the type of shit. This is why we can't get the fucking top 100.

263
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,690
It's like Larry over there gets fucking stuck in the water and that's okay. Whatever.

264
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:26,500
That's fine. I did it myself. I did it myself. Anybody else getting hungry? Dude, I shit my

265
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,420
What do you mean? It's Alvin. It's Alvin. How is it? Why are they all down here? Where's four?

266
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:55,500
Wait, why do we it's out? Wait, it wasn't supposed to be. Wait, what does it sound like?

267
00:45:56,139 --> 00:46:22,010
It's supposed to just be like lower pitch. Alvin and the E3 monks. Okay. I forget who is who.

268
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:59,449
Dude, can you fucking get a better mic? It sucks so bad. I know none of us here like

269
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:06,920
to bring it up. But like, I'm gonna bring it up because it's fucking annoying. Yeah,

270
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:18,809
it is kind of annoying. No, dude, it sounds even fucking worse. It's like, it's like you

271
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:21,210
ripped it out and put it back in. You know, just don't even talk to yourself. Just mute.

272
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,380
Yeah, just mute until you can get it figured out.

273
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:52,280
Okay, let's move out soldiers. This is fucking toxic. Also guys, remember, if you roll need on

274
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,440
anything, you're going to get kicked out. It's on Master Looter. If anyone wants to roll on

275
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,719
something if you roll need for something, you're going to be using your DKP. And I run this guild

276
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,079
and I am at every single event. So I have like 50,000 DKP. What a great system this was. I can

277
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:18,420
get anything I want whenever I want. No matter what it is. I have five DKP. Do I get anything?

278
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,739
Do I get anything? Do I get anything? Can I get some armor? Yeah, dude, we'll have somebody in

279
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:32,139
the guild craft you something, man. They'll craft it for you. It's like tier one dog shit,

280
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:41,750
but you know, whatever. Who cares? I keep falling off and they keep following me to my death.

281
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:57,079
Kill this thing. Come on, kill it. Toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic, toxic.

282
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:11,960
Hey, can you guys wait up? I got lost back here. Every fucking time. Seriously, dude, every fucking

283
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,730
time. Pop this shit out or fucking leave. Just leave the guild if you can't fucking handle it.

284
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:21,130
Well, I didn't. I'm just like, I'm busy. Yeah, you're busy, but you can't do anything. You

285
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,650
fucking know. You're absolutely worthless. I'm sick of this shit. Can we stop fighting, please?

286
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:34,409
It's not even. He's such a fucking idiot and I'm sick of him being in this guild. He always brings

287
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:39,320
us down. He always is too slow and he always is causing problems. I'm not going to be in a

288
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,780
guild with him anymore. What the fuck, dude? Chill the fuck out. I'm not going to chill the fuck out

289
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:51,849
because I'm sick of you having to need shit and have to come up through the rankings here to get

290
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:56,170
gear that I could use. And I have my DPS meters like fucking 10 times higher than you.

291
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:19,380
Let me talk. This is getting too real. It's too real. I have to beat the mission first. That's

292
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:35,079
important. That's a 50 DKP mine. That's an old one. That's old. This is a toxic fucking guilt.

293
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:44,039
Yeah, we'll deal with it. You signed up. You went through the vigorous application process,

294
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:50,380
didn't you? And what did you say? What did you say? No, tell me. Tell me what you said.

295
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,119
Look, we all went through the process. Don't be a dick to him just because we all knew that

296
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,690
it was going to be 10 hours a day. We have shit to do, man. It can't just be all about World of

297
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,969
Warcraft. I mean, not that. What are we playing right now? What's this fucking MMO? Evolva,

298
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:13,960
dude. It's not just all about Evolva. You make everything all about Evolva and it's actually

299
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:22,619
kind of irritating. It's not all about Evolva? What are you talking about? What are all of you

300
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,900
talking about? You know what? All three of you. All three of you. One, two, three. Out of the

301
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,260
fucking guild. Goodbye. I will find other people that will replace you that can actually pull more

302
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,940
than 4K DPS. That's right. Jake, you can't fucking pull more than three and a half.

303
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:55,480
I'll show you how it is. Fucking dick. If you beat me, you get killed later. How's that sound?

304
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:09,849
I'm going to do my best. Stop trying. Come on, Jake. I think I'm going to get beaten by some

305
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:18,420
worm recruit. Not going to happen. Stupid idiot. I got you into this guild. Don't forget where you

306
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:25,099
came from. Don't forget I got you into the guild. I don't care where you are. My voice may have

307
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:32,059
changed, but it doesn't even matter. I don't think we can kill each other. I think, oh yeah,

308
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:46,019
right. We're in Shattrath City. We can't hurt each other. That's what I thought.

309
00:52:53,179 --> 00:53:01,579
No, I just want to beat. Oh, I just want to beat the mission for the love of God.

310
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:22,630
We've lost him for good this time. Wait, everybody already made the jump and I just,

311
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:28,710
if you see me on the kill later, I can see you follow me. I don't follow anybody else.

312
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:36,570
I'm fucking losing my mind. I have to, I have to beat this. That's a whaling caverns jump.

313
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:43,269
I just have to get the jump. I just have to get the jump. All right. I'm going to make this jump.

314
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:46,789
If I don't make this, if I do not make this jump this time, I'm going to gift a hundred subs.

315
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:51,880
I swear to God, I'm going to gift 100 subs if I don't get it this time.

316
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,760
Dude, that's kind of a lot of subs. Are you sure you want to do that?

317
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,280
Shit. Dude, that's kind of, dude, that's kind of a lot of subs. Are you sure that you want to do that?

318
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,400
I am sure. Thank you, Jake. I am absolutely sure.

319
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:30,440
No more. Give me the fast. Give me the fast guy. Give me the guild leader. He'll do it.

320
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:39,289
Okay. We're good. I made it. Okay. I don't have to give a thousand subs, whatever the hell it was.

321
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:55,260
Oh, look who didn't make the jump. Look who didn't make the jump after all that.

322
00:54:57,909 --> 00:55:00,550
Shut up, Jake. I mean, Bob.

323
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,039
Look who didn't make the fucking jump. And there he is keeping us up again.

324
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:13,659
Take your time, by all means, Jake. I just got the game two days ago.

325
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,809
See, I can't do it.

326
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,489
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Give it to him, everybody.

327
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:44,519
Anybody else not care that he died? Not really. He was kind of a good person.

328
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:50,309
Yeah, he sucked. He sucked big time.

329
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:58,780
Jake, why don't you lead us from now on? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

330
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:17,000
All right. Me? Me? Okay, I'll try. Ready? Jump. You guys can do it. Come on. You can do it.

331
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,239
Uh, you know, maybe I should lead for now and then maybe eventually you can take over

332
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,849
and you get, you know, your bearings and everything and everything. Good to go.

333
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:52,780
Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Okay, let's go. The streamer doesn't have to

334
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,780
gift a hundred subs because he made it to the point that he got to. I'm watching the same stream

335
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:05,639
as you guys. That doesn't count. I don't have to give a hundred subs because I fell off. No,

336
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:12,920
falling off is not, I didn't try to go for a jump. I said if I didn't make the jump,

337
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,039
then I would gift a hundred subs. Not if I fell down backwards off the cliff. That's not, that's,

338
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:31,480
we don't, I don't have to do that. That's a scam. No, I said if I fall off. No, shit. I said if I

339
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:43,190
jump, he gave me the clip. Jake is still stuck down there. That's fine print. That's not scam.

340
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:55,019
No, I made the jump and then that was over. He's scamming. Technically, technically,

341
00:57:55,019 --> 00:58:14,710
I haven't even saved the game. Not like copyright. Okay, there you go. Stop watching this scammer.

342
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:43,349
Hold on, hold on to your seats, everybody. Hold on. I'll meet you halfway at 50 because I

343
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:52,440
fell. I didn't jump. How's that song? I'll meet you halfway. I'll meet you halfway. I fell. I

344
00:58:52,440 --> 00:59:00,010
didn't jump. I fell back. I'll meet you halfway. Deal? Deal. Deal. Is that a deal? 75 is not halfway.

345
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:21,130
Okay, let me do this. I have to like, am I logged in? There is a, there is, what was that? That's

346
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:26,010
YouTuber kind of days. There is, okay, there is a mature audience warning at the beginning of this.

347
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:33,019
You guys have been lying to me for like a year. Non-descript civilian making up my subs that I'm

348
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:40,630
not giving. All right, gift a sub. Let's go. I'll meet you at 50. I didn't, I technically,

349
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:59,159
I fell backwards. I didn't jump. Come on, Gwen. There it is. Did you get it? Did you get one?

350
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:14,550
Did you get one? 50 community subs from Chirba985. Thanks, dude. I really appreciate that.

351
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:23,210
Five from Pugatron, five from AjaxTheMidiocre, 10 from AjaxTheMidiocre, and then $105 from StormyChu.

352
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:31,429
Holy shit. You made up the other 50. You don't have to do that. That's insane. 200, like,

353
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:38,539
that's a lot of money. You don't have to do that. That's 50 community subs from Inferno23.

354
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:43,559
You don't gotta make up for me. That's a shitload of subs. That's a lot of money.

355
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:54,780
You just gave the money back. StormyChu, thanks for the $105, which is also insane. Now,

356
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,900
I haven't laughed this much in a very long time. I'm glad I tuned into the stream. Thank you.

357
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,849
Glad you're having a good time. Let's keep going. What do you say? Thanks for the extreme amount

358
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:09,019
of money. Me and friends. He called his friends. He called them friends. He called them friends.

359
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:20,460
He called his friends. It slipped. And thanks for the five, Jamie. Thanks for this five subs.

360
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:34,630
All right, let's go. All right. Who's still alive? That's seriously, that's a ton of money.

361
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:51,420
What is number four still doing? Can four not make the jump? What's the problem? Why are you

362
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:59,269
still down here? All right. I'm just going to keep going. We're going to go with the new leader here.

363
01:01:59,269 --> 01:02:09,380
What's this? This is the pickup point? Oh shit. This is the pickup point. Get on up there.

364
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:31,739
You set them to hold position. I did. What button was that? Enter mutator, group genos,

365
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:43,139
ungroup them, select them, command mode, command all, best geno. All right. Command mode. Pause.

366
01:02:52,099 --> 01:03:05,500
Pause. Oh, regroup them. Don't regroup to you. All right. Group. Regroup to me. Command. Group.

367
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:26,550
T. All to me. There they go. All right. Nice. What is best geno? Command. Hurry up. Get over here.

368
01:03:28,389 --> 01:04:04,219
Come on, Jake. Let's go. I'll take control. Come on. Just go. Go. I almost didn't make it.

369
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:20,420
Get to the checkpoint. Hurry. All right. We made it. F10. We only lost one. Mission status completed.

370
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:28,730
Objectives. Do them all. Killed 65%. Killed 76%. We got jump, claw, and speed. New genes.

371
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:40,420
Land number two. No boss. There is a boss. We have to beat the first boss. I'm not moving

372
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:45,670
until we beat the first boss. Employ your team of geno hunters. Locate and destroy any non-indigenous

373
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:51,130
structures in the vicinity. It would appear that these creatures have been created by some organism

374
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:56,809
for its own protection. Scans have revealed that the seismic activity relates to the rapid

375
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:01,369
appearance of a number of structures interconnected by tentacle-like roots that may serve as conduits.

376
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:25,289
Resident sleeper. Whatever. Okay. All right. Obtain type one explosive plant spore. Who's back?

377
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:35,989
The dick. Oh, that means there's probably going to be like a T-Rex behind them chasing them. Yep.

378
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:41,670
I knew it. All right. Get in. Get in. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. All right. Get in.

379
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:04,500
Nice DPS. All right. We're going to use the strong one. Big kid hulk. That name doesn't

380
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:23,860
make any sense anymore. It doesn't. What the hell is that? Is that machine guns? Okay. This machine,

381
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:33,269
this guns. All right. Let's take a look at the mutating. I can do more power and more speed

382
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:40,329
or more jump and more power. More power and more speed. Always. All right. Keep that the way it is.

383
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:54,260
What about you? More power, more jump or more jump, more speed. More power, more jump. Your speed

384
01:06:54,260 --> 01:07:02,059
only. We got power or just even more speed. Even more speed. I do even more speed. Even more speed.

385
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:08,360
What about you? I feel like you've been pretty neglected. What can you do?

386
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:18,460
Is this damage? Damage and speed? Sure. Good. Yeah. That's fine. All right. Let's go.

387
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,679
Use speed so you can get this done.

388
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:58,710
Come on. Oh, safe spot right here. Get up here. More evolve. Don't fall off. All right. We're good.

389
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:07,670
Keep going. Everyone with me? You're doing Dexville. Is it boss time? I don't know. Maybe.

390
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:13,130
Watch it. Watch it. Don't go any close. Stay over here. Come over here and stay.

391
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:31,699
Stay. I thought T was stay. Somebody dead? Come on. You two idiots. What are you doing?

392
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:43,979
Go. Make your way through it, please. All right. Here comes one. He's still having trouble. Whatever.

393
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:55,369
All right. How do I make them? T. T. T and S for stay. One is having trouble. All right. What's up?

394
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,939
Fighting down there. Okay. I'm going to go to one. No, no, no. Do not follow one.

395
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:08,250
Don't follow one. Are you following one? You're not supposed to be. Oh, fuck him. Who cares?

396
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:30,260
Wait. Okay. Good. Wait. None of them have jump. I hope they can make this. Finally. You made it.

397
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:35,909
Fuck you long enough. There's a hole. All right. Who's got the biggest claws?

398
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:43,289
Three. All right. How do I get people to stay? I want you to stay over here and stay here.

399
01:09:44,010 --> 01:10:04,760
What's the stay command? Group and group nearby genos. Group all genos. Ungroup them is H.

400
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:16,579
Command mode is tab. Command all genos. B? Team chat. That's chat. What are you talking about?

401
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:36,970
It's H. Okay. Ready? Let's go. All right. Now. One at a time. Don't. Oh, fuck. Take him into the

402
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:50,649
electrocution room. Don't get yourself killed. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Just go. Go.

403
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:54,250
Go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. And go.

404
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:07,770
The neg? Can I pick this egg up? What's it doing? Is it healing me? I think it's a heal.

405
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:21,939
Oh, this is the explosive. How do I get it? How do I pick it up? Okay. It's R. Obtain type two

406
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:29,989
explosive. Oh, shit. Can I pick up these little guys? All right. Let's go back through here.

407
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:39,960
Is this a Dreamcast game? Yeah. Go this way. All right. What happens if we. Is it fall damage?

408
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:51,270
Yep. It's quite a lot actually. Well, we're going to lose the leader again.

409
01:11:53,770 --> 01:12:05,770
Dreamcast fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. Favorite comment ever. I think I can level up

410
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:15,220
again. Chuck E. Cheese is streaming fall guides. Yeah, I know. I know. It's a guy in a Chuck E.

411
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:20,260
Look, you had my attention at first when you said it was Chuck E. Cheese, but it's not the 3D

412
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:26,500
animated Chuck E. Cheese. It's a guy in a Chuck E. Cheese costume opening his mouth every so often.

413
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,220
Like if it was the 3D animated Chuck E. Cheese and he had like a guy talking for him and stuff.

414
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:57,800
VTuber Chuck. VTuber Chuck E. Cheese. Kill this thing. We need more damage.

415
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:07,699
Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Eating the explosions. Just back away when they get like that.

416
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:16,500
Okay. I gotta level up. Let's go with one. What do you got? This is new. I don't know if that is.

417
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,220
Okay. This game just got cool. This is becoming a cool game now. I can breathe fire out of my mouth.

418
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:34,600
Yeah. Oh, I'll take it. Okay. What about new? New two. Shit. Is that? Okay. No. Okay. Oh,

419
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:41,319
you can do them all. I don't have to get out of the menu. What's this one? Is this fire?

420
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:58,420
What is that? That's not fire. It is fire. Damage. Damage. Well, I don't want two people doing fire.

421
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:08,840
All right. You don't do that. Don't do that. Something else. Give more jump. Oh, this guy's

422
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:35,159
fucked. Whatever. Who breathes fire? Where's the fire breather? Back up. How do I breathe fire?

423
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,630
Oh, it's okay. There you go. You have to select two. All right. Does it use mana?

424
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:57,100
All right. That's awesome. That's awesome. Holy shit. Is this too loud?

425
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:06,310
Why didn't everybody tell me this? It's still too loud. I can finally hear myself think.

426
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:17,100
Okay. Go in. I can't wait to get the first boss. Burn. Fire versus fire. I can burn the leaves.

427
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:28,039
That's cool. I'm going to raid Chuck E. Cheese right now? You want to raid Chuck E. Cheese

428
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:46,039
right now and have my stream end? No, I'm still streaming. All right. Give me claws.

429
01:15:52,699 --> 01:16:00,579
Mirror. Please. They said they... No. I'm not having you guys gaslight me and telling me that

430
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:04,340
Chuck E. Cheese said he was a big fan or something. No, that's not going to work.

431
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:21,430
It's not going to work right now. Help. He did. Whatever. I used to love that place. I used to

432
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:28,199
love bringing in my report card and clearly there's like a bunch of C's and D's on it,

433
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:31,239
but they didn't want anyone to feel bad, so they gave you the same amount of tokens.

434
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:39,539
That's the person that came in with straight A's. If you showed a report card with like B's or higher,

435
01:16:39,539 --> 01:16:43,909
this is a real story. I'm about to give you guys some real story. I may have told this before,

436
01:16:43,909 --> 01:16:49,770
but I can tell it again. I don't care. When I was a little kid, we would go to Chuck E. Cheese

437
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:59,369
and my mother, God bless her, she would use my brother's and sister's report cards and try to

438
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:05,479
get a package deal because my report card sucked. It'd be like, well, take a look at this.

439
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,319
This kid's got straight A's. This kid's got straight A's and B's. I think that's okay.

440
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:18,329
We deserve the tokens. I was sitting there just like with my finger in my nose. I don't do good

441
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:24,819
in math. It was like a 17-year-old behind the counter. He's not going to be like, well,

442
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:36,550
he didn't have exactly a 3.0. We think they care? No. What? Of course not. All right, let's get

443
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:47,239
fast, Jerma. Let's burn, Jerma. Burn, Jerma. I don't like the fire. These ones hate it.

444
01:17:47,960 --> 01:18:09,369
Anybody level up yet? Jerma, look. That kind hates ice and fire. Three is about to die.

445
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:20,220
Three's dead. Two hits. Does anybody have a heal? Where's the healer? Somebody help me. Save me.

446
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:43,689
Save me. Where's two? Uh-oh, two's almost dead too. Jerma, don't look. The link sucks. Does it?

447
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:54,550
What? Anybody level up again? Yep. All right. This is fire. Yeah, more fire. More firepower.

448
01:18:55,369 --> 01:19:01,479
More firepower. I don't know what the hell this person's doing, but should we give them the claws

449
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:06,729
back? No, let's make this fast jumping guy. He doesn't do any damage. That makes sense.

450
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,609
You need to have your one scout on the team, right? And this is...

451
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:22,579
You're going to have to be DPS now because we lost the other guy. All right. Yeah, four is DPS.

452
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:38,680
Look, chat. There's no way I'm not going to cut my hand off. What the hell is this? What the hell is

453
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:46,619
that? What's the point of writing that? Wait, didn't three have a... Combine type one and type two to

454
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:55,770
create an explosive. Uh, where's the other egg? Wasn't three carrying the egg? Okay, thank God.

455
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:09,380
Wait, combine the two of them. How do I combine the eggs? I think it'll just do it automatically?

456
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:23,210
Germa, it's real. All right. If this link is not at least a seven or eight out of ten,

457
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:30,840
I'll be very upset with you guys. If this link is not at least a seven out of ten,

458
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:45,800
I have an issue. Fuck you, cheese. Yeah, I'm a fan of Germa and love him. Is that doctor? Is that

459
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:54,489
real? Is this a doctored image? Wait, is this actually the... Hold on. I got to be careful

460
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:59,479
here because... Let me show you. Let me show you. This is important. We have to discuss this.

461
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:11,220
Did somebody just make this account and start broadcasting and then screencap it or fake it?

462
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:16,659
Or is this the real account? That's real? So this must mean I must get infinite tokens at every

463
01:21:16,659 --> 01:21:26,420
Chuck E. Cheese I ever go to. That has to be what it means. Can I just show this at any Chuck E.

464
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:33,050
Cheese and be like, hey, yeah, I mean, you know, so act like it's a report card. Let's go.

465
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:46,840
Of Germa and Chuck E. Cheese crossover. I don't want... Okay. Chuck E. Cheese was awesome.

466
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,859
It was such a fun place to be when you were a kid. Did I just say the tagline? No, it's where a kid

467
01:21:52,859 --> 01:22:02,170
can be a kid. Is that Toys R' Us? What is it? What's the tagline? But 35 year old man doing a

468
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:07,319
collab with Chuck E. Cheese. Well, I don't know what we would do there. What does that mean?

469
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:20,810
And that wouldn't be kind of a little weird. It would. But how would you do that? I don't

470
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:30,819
know if I... Look, okay, unless I have like a niece or a nephew with me at 35. I'm not going

471
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:39,189
into Chuck E. Cheese, guys. I'm not going there for the pizza. What would I do? What would it be?

472
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:49,140
Why would I be in there? You're a loser. Why? Why not? Because it's where a kid can be a kid.

473
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:56,119
Not where a 35 year old man can be a 35 year old man. We have enough bowling alleys, guys,

474
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:31,270
but you're a kid inside. He drowned. So he just pushed my head under water. Don't tell him, guys.

475
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:39,300
I'm right behind him. He streams in a bathtub. He streams in a four foot deep pool. The computer

476
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:48,140
is up on one of those weird rafts. I just dunked his ass. Can I get some plus twos? And I come back

477
01:23:48,140 --> 01:24:08,760
up and like, oh, what the fuck, man? I wasn't ready for that. What is it where a kid can be a kid?

478
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:19,560
What is that from? And why do these guys only have eyeballs now? DPS? Nobody's just lost.

479
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:38,630
Will you fight it? Chuck E. Cheese has blackjack now. Can you imagine a bunch of like little kids

480
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:45,140
sitting around playing blackjack? And the dealer would have to be a kid too. That's the only way

481
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:56,520
that would work. That's the only way this works for me. Sorry, sir. You busted. Oh, no. Oh, man.

482
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:07,699
21. I got blackjack. That's right, kids. Come on in to Chuck E. Cheese. We've got all your

483
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:19,399
favorite slots. Blackjack. Poker. And they give Chuck E. Cheese like a big gold tooth.

484
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:28,859
And he smiles. Come on in, kids. He leans in and is in his teeth. He pulls back his mouth and smiles.

485
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:37,260
Deep. Ding. Right into the camera. This guy's not strong enough to break this. No, we need fire guy.

486
01:25:37,819 --> 01:26:00,250
In fact, fire guy's the only guy that's good. Kids out of blackjack table. Things that you should

487
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:14,359
never see. Wait, Chuck E. Cheese. What? Hold on. What does this say? I need to read this. Apparently,

488
01:26:14,359 --> 01:26:21,880
this is... God damn it. It was all a fucking lie. It was all a lie. It was all a lie. It was all a

489
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:27,510
lie. This is all a doctored lie. The whole thing. I got, I got gaslit again. Again,

490
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:35,300
it happens every stream. It happens every single stream. It's a fake account. It's a fake fucking

491
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,619
account. You put the stupid fucking thing on here. Of course you did. Yeah. Chuck E. Cheese would

492
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:47,399
never say something like that. Got my hopes up so bad. Chuck E. Cheese would never say that.

493
01:26:49,449 --> 01:26:54,630
I can't believe it. I knew it too, because I'm like, yeah, you could have just like made this in

494
01:26:54,630 --> 01:27:02,460
10 seconds. Chuck E. Cheese holds himself to a much higher standard than that. It's real. It's not real.

495
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:12,060
Chuck E. Cheese does not ask me if I eat ass. Chuck E. Cheese did not say that. I, I am absolutely

496
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:17,770
positive about this. If I've, if I've been positive of anything in my whole life, ever, it's that

497
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:30,060
Chuck E. Cheese did not ask if you eat ass. There's not a chance. Like, you could tell me,

498
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:35,689
look behind you, dude, there's an alien spaceship that's about to just drop fucking beams of light

499
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:39,819
of death onto us. And I would be like, yeah, that's probably more, that would probably happen.

500
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:46,420
That's accurate. I'm okay with that. That's fine. Sure. Whatever. That's more able to happen than a

501
01:27:46,420 --> 01:28:00,699
do you eat ass Chuck E. Cheese comment. I like, I didn't even believe it either. I believed it for

502
01:28:00,699 --> 01:28:16,819
like 10 seconds. Check the VOD. What lucky T on the VOD. At some point you see him reach over to

503
01:28:16,819 --> 01:28:33,909
his keyboard and just start like enter. Wait, don't go that way. We still have fast guy. Yep.

504
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:50,619
Oh, we have to blow something up in chat. He's not in chat. He's busy playing fall guys and

505
01:28:50,619 --> 01:29:02,390
entertaining millions of children around the world. You didn't have time for me. I need claws.

506
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:11,750
Back it up. What do you mean? I'm looking at the viewer list right now. And if this is another

507
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:25,420
just total gaslight campaign, I'm going to be so bad users in chat. Okay. So Chuckle Morris and

508
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:30,279
Chuck E. Cheese real are the only two people in this chat that have Chuck in their name.

509
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:35,880
So, wow. I can't believe it. Chuck E. Cheese real is in here. That's unbelievable. Like,

510
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:43,880
that's so weird. Remember if you put real at the end of your name, that has to be real.

511
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:54,090
All right. Follow me. Oh, can I revive three or is he dead the whole game?

512
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:11,000
Guys, there's a stop running into that. There's a real German nine eight five in this chat.

513
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:34,229
So yeah, that's easy to determine. Will you guys leave them alone? Can I destroy these?

514
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:51,560
Oh, all right. Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast. EPS. I need to control the DPS.

515
01:30:52,119 --> 01:31:02,300
That's our only hope of victory at all. This game's actually kind of fun. I could see

516
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:14,619
four. Did you hear how crazy that that Sybilis was? I mean, I just whistled to you when I was

517
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:32,039
like 14. I would have loved this. I got to be a level up tune. What tune are you going to be on?

518
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:48,060
I died. I never I did the tune. I don't ever like to tune. I like character. Get out of here.

519
01:31:48,060 --> 01:32:05,750
Out, out, out, out. Don't stand in that. Don't be stupid. Attention. Attention. What do you want?

520
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:21,579
You got it. You've got my attention. You have my attention. What is it? Actually here. Wait,

521
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:31,720
is that real? Is that a real name, though? Chuck E. Cheese is here. What are you? What's

522
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,000
what is Chuck E. Cheese doing here? What have you got? What did you guys do? Why did you do this?

523
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:50,069
