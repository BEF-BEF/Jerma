00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:12,490
Hello everybody, welcome to the stream. I'm sorry, I was in chat talking about taxes.

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:20,379
We were discussing taxes, paying taxes and all that stuff. What are taxes? You know, we had to

3
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:24,379
go through an entire... this is for the vlog viewers, by the way. We had to go through an entire thing

4
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:34,020
of what taxes are dating back to the British, right? That's where it started and that's, you know,

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,340
that's how... that's where it began. And now the British now run the IRS, so we still have to pay

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:58,460
England. It's weird, but you know, no. Yeah, the one thing about taxes I will tell you is if you

7
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:07,659
are 1099, right? Because I used to be... you get a W-2 and somebody pays your taxes. And so I took

8
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,980
up money for health insurance and retirement and, okay, I don't have to do anything. When you become

9
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:21,030
full 1099, it's all you, man. You're gonna do it all. And it's just like, wait, hold on, what do I

10
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:31,420
have to do? But back in 2011, I got a CPA and I made sure... I was like, please, like, make sure

11
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:44,420
this is all correct. Thank you. And I've been using them for like seven years. Keep those receipts. Oh

12
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,239
yeah. And they have to like... that's like the next part is understanding what is like an expense,

13
00:01:51,239 --> 00:02:01,769
what isn't an expense. It's difficult stuff. QuickBooks self-employed is pretty helpful.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,879
Yeah, I just... I'm an idiot and I'll fuck something up. I'd rather just have somebody that

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,330
knows what they're doing that specializes in it, be able to do it, because I can't. I'll open up

16
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,330
QuickBooks and I'll be like, oh yeah, this, this, this, this, send it in. I'll get it wrong.

17
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:31,479
No, no, no, no. A good accountant is like a good mechanic. If you find one, do everything you can

18
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:43,449
to keep them. That's, that's the best statement I've read in the last 10 seconds. Even everything

19
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:58,810
laid out. And never do it for free. The next statement is the best. What about a barber?

20
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,449
That's yeah, there are a couple of things that you really need to hold on to in life. A good

21
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,740
CPA, like a good accountant, right? A good, a good doctor, right? Everybody wants a good doctor,

22
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:17,699
good accountant, good doctor, good car mechanic, a good lawyer, a good chef. Make sure you always

23
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,419
have a good chef around in your house. A good maid to make sure like you're very clean.

24
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,210
All these people have to come with you, by the way, wherever you go. And they all need a room

25
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:44,500
in your house. A good mailman. That's right. Yep. Imagine you had a doctor like live in your house.

26
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,360
Oh, that'd be fucking amazing. That'd be the best thing ever. I wish that were the case.

27
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,740
Imagine waking up with like you, you, you brushing your teeth and you're like, wait,

28
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,020
hold on. You're like, you stick your tongue out. There's like a little spot on your tongue and

29
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,699
like your tongue hurts. That's happened to me. And what am I going to make a doctor's appointment

30
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:09,159
for that? No, no, you just go bang, bang, just like, Hey doc. And it's like, it's like six

31
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,439
o'clock in the morning. He's like, fuck, what is, what is it? Hey, look at my tongue for a second.

32
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,560
He's like, hold on to me. And he like pulls the tongue and let me see that. Nah, that's just an

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,839
inflamed taste bud. You're going to be fine. It's like, Oh God. And he goes back to bed.

34
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,870
And then like you go to the next, you know, while that happens, I drop a plate and it smashes on the

35
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,310
ground and the doctor goes back to bed and I'm like, yeah, don't worry about it. I go to the next door.

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Uh, maid? Open the door. Yeah. I just dropped a plate on the ground. Can you like help? Can

37
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,329
take care of that? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Like they take care of that and you're good.

38
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,149
Oh God. That's got $50. I'm just going to have like a hotel of employees,

39
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:05,300
not even employees though. It's just all people that do jobs that are, that are very like skilled

40
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,269
jobs, things that, that are difficult to do a service jobs. Have like a police officer too,

41
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:19,220
just to have in here, just in case like the doctor fights the mechanic over breakfast or something,

42
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,579
like somebody who picks up a fork and he starts to lunge and all that. Oh, the cop is going to

43
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:34,620
take care of that. Just explaining this is the white house. This is just being the president.

44
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:54,259
This is the, this is being the president. Uh, anyways, thank you too. But to, all right,

45
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:03,029
to back us up here. Yes. Uh, having a good accountant is a good thing to have, especially

46
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:10,329
because you got to make sure you buy the book. Otherwise, uh, I'm going to have to answer that

47
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:16,339
door and it's my turn to open the door and it's a laundry list of, excuse me, you're coming to

48
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,500
court now. And I'm like, hold on, wait a minute, get the chef. And the chef comes down and he's

49
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,029
like, what's happening? And he's like, oh, you get, you're getting arrested. All right, whatever. I

50
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:35,100
can't do anything about that. Or it was the chef and I like to take the chef and I like push him

51
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,209
in front of it. It was the chef that did it. What are you talking about? I just cook and they're

52
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:53,990
like, they like cuff him up. He, oh yeah, he was cooking the books. I understand. And then I like

53
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,709
wink at the, I wink at the fucking guy at the, at the, the officer at the door. I'm like,

54
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,399
fuck that whole segment. What do you mean that joke was awful? Somebody, one of you guys said

55
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:25,240
that I was responding to it. It was a great joke actually. Mod that guy that made it.

56
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:33,990
No one said that. Yes, they did. Scroll up. They're now modded. Okay. Anyway, what are we doing?

57
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,029
Where am I? I'm in front of, I'm in front of a stream. Oh, shift the blame. Yeah, it was this guy.

58
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:54,459
It was this guy, Jacob. It was me. All right, we're going to play, uh, jack pox, jack pox party pox.

59
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,470
That's what we call it here. We're going to play jack box tonight.

60
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,230
Then we might as well just switch over to it right now because, uh, why not? It's right here.

61
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:16,410
Jack pox party pack, jack pox party pack five. It is going to be fun. Did I say it was going to

62
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,709
be fun? Why am I speaking in the past tense here? That doesn't make very much sense. But,

63
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:31,189
but more importantly, $50 came in from cookie CRM. 50, $50. Thank you cookie for the 50 bucks.

64
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,620
Hey, German, just a heads up. Uh, patently stupid is not a good game for stream. It's not very funny

65
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:46,789
or fun to play. Split the room in mad verse city are fantastic. All right, well we'll see.

66
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:55,019
I mean, we're going to try them all even if we do it once, but I heard, I have heard that a few of

67
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,549
these, at least two or three of them are very fun and very funny, but whatever this is, this is,

68
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,740
this is community night. You know, we do, we do sometimes we do, we do community night here.

69
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:17,909
You know what I mean? Uh, by the way, speaking of that, how this is going to work tonight

70
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:26,470
is just kind of scared me. So, uh, in the sub room of the discord is going to get the code.

71
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,139
There are a lot of you now, so good luck getting into the room. If you get into the room,

72
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,049
we kindly ask that you do not come back for another game. Uh, you can only play once. If

73
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,610
there's a way that I can remove somebody or I have to restart or something, that's what we're going

74
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,370
to do, or we might have to make a separate room, I will figure it out, right? But only one time,

75
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:05,669
only one time. So, I hope you're ready to begin, because I'm ready to begin. Which one are we

76
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:10,139
going to start with? How about we just go from top to bottom? Does that make sense? Why is this one

77
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:22,120
not family friendly? This is the only one that's not family friendly. What does that mean? We mean

78
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:31,080
it. Well, what do you, what does that mean though? All right, well, the parent, okay, this is the not

79
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:39,899
safe for work trivia game. All right. Oh, let's do it. You don't know Jack. You don't know Jack.

80
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:47,860
Shit. So how's the audio? Should I turn myself down? What are you trying to say? What are you

81
00:10:47,860 --> 00:11:00,299
trying to say? What are you trying to say? Oh, I didn't tell Twitter. Ah, you're right. I didn't

82
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:11,639
tell Twitter. What do you say? This is the stream. There's people looking up at my bald fucking head.

83
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,179
I'm not even bald. Why do we do this thing on this channel where things are just absolutely

84
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:24,250
100% not true and we treat them like they are? You died to pinwheel. No, I didn't. You're bald.

85
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:31,580
I have fucking more hair than probably half the people on this website. I got a full head of hair.

86
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:46,500
What, what's the bald thing? You're stupid. Oh, really? I can't. All right. Well, that one might.

87
00:11:46,500 --> 00:12:05,299
I can't fight that one. You're short. Not that short. All right. Let me tweet this up. Oh,

88
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:12,490
Chunky baloney. Chunky baloney giving out five community subs. Thank you, Chunky.

89
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:22,629
That is five. That is a five spot from Chunky baloney. I got one. I got one.

90
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:34,009
Thanks a lot, man. Your hair smells. My whole body smells. What are you talking about?

91
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,620
No, no. I mean, not right now. Hold on a second. I'm supposed to be tweeting out the stream.

92
00:12:45,289 --> 00:13:05,210
Yeah. Jack box five. And then after the stream, hold on. Jack box five. See, now I tweeted it out.

93
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:14,460
Now everyone can relax. You know what I'm saying? Um, describe, describe the smell. Um,

94
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:29,929
cinnamon, uh, uh, jade, cinnamon and jade, clean cinnamon jade laundry. There you go.

95
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:39,580
All right. Uh, this needs to be, uh, right. Audiences on require Twitch, right? That's

96
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:47,879
important. Post game sharing. Um, I don't think I want to do that. Hi, gibberish. I would have to

97
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,700
delete my Twitch channel if that were the case. Uh, allow room hiding. Yep. Allow room code to be

98
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,539
hidden to prevent players from joining early. Recommended if you're streaming the game. Yes.

99
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,279
Max players eight. Sounds about right. Sounds about right. Let's scroll up a little bit here.

100
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,419
Okay. All right. I think that's good. Make the game loud. Oh no, that was them. Just all right.

101
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:22,730
Here we go. So, uh, for pro grammatically generated content, I think I'm going to,

102
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:29,240
I think I'm ready. So how Jack box works, you know, played it streaming services,

103
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,480
they'll tell you pipe is more than just the trivia hit. You don't know. Jack.

104
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,279
It's also a deep well of content that we cannot legally guarantee. You'll ever be able to access

105
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:50,299
or interact with. But, uh, so you go to jackbox.tv and once you're in jackbox.tv,

106
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:55,690
you're going to get a room code. If you're in the sub discord, it's going to show up

107
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,529
there in just a moment. What's the matter, Mark? I'm trying to find my blood type,

108
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,809
but these medical forms are just so complicated. Nevermind. Not for this first game by the way.

109
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,970
No, just send all your information to binge pipe and they'll find the

110
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,570
not for the first one. Hey, come on in everybody. Welcome to the first day. Yeah.

111
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,570
History credit card details, voting record, deepest fears, food allergies,

112
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,289
romantic preferences, and lucky numbers. And they'll sort through it to find the data I need

113
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:30,889
and leftover details for themselves. That sounds great. Looks like I won't need this paperwork.

114
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,690
And with the extra time we can get whatever. Do you like burritos?

115
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:42,649
I don't know. I'll have to ask binge pipe. Sorry. Sorry. I'll do it again.

116
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,690
The number one over medication that prevents nosebleeds caused by whatever it's we're going

117
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,009
to be here for like four or five hours. It's okay with your mind. Then my taxes is right.

118
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:59,450
Go to jackbox.tv. Put an HZ NE punch. I am the lion punch. You'll be able to participate as the

119
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:06,250
audience of the demon ways. Protector of the five shards of the crow core. HZ NE

120
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,129
avenge my father. And that's what I'm going to do.

121
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,409
Yeah. I wanted to, I wanted a mod or two to play the first game and then I was going to

122
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,929
put it in the sub discord and then I accidentally pressed that button.

123
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:27,210
I have to, my father just saw what happened. I have to do it and I will do it with or without

124
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,490
felt that was going to happen. I'm in the room. What are you talking about?

125
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:39,769
I'm in the sub discord right now. All right. So everybody's in. No way. Press everybody's

126
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:46,570
in the start. That's a lion punch on binge pipe. Please just press everybody's in.

127
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,379
Do I, do I have to join? No. Wait, what? Do I have to do that?

128
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,210
To be the new home of you don't know Jack. $50. No, $50 is not a stock photo.

129
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:10,259
All right. I'm cookie Masterson and I have no idea why they call it a cookie.

130
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:17,299
Cookie CRM just gave $50. What do you mean I'm not in the game? That reminds me of my childhood dog

131
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,500
because he also ate people specifically mine. I don't, it doesn't automatically put me in

132
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:37,690
because I'm the host. I have to go on my phone. What? I was the host of the game. I have to,

133
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:46,410
oh fuck me. I have to be in the browser. I thought I hadn't played in like two years,

134
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,819
whatever. I'm not even in the audience. I got to join the audience.

135
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:04,150
No, no, I'm turning this off. I can't fucking believe I'm about to do this.

136
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,190
Enter the, what was the room code? HZHN. What's the room code?

137
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:27,269
HZNE. Enter your name. Bill. Okay, I'm ready. I'm in the audience.

138
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:41,430
All right. So it's a septillion. Yeah. I hate to lead you on. None of you got it.

139
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,509
A quintillion has 18 zeros and consequently six commas to go along with it.

140
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,420
I need to like, no, this is funny. This is cool. I want to participate. I mean, I would keep all

141
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:08,170
my money, of course, but the poor can have half the punctuation. Can I participate? I can't. All

142
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,970
right. I'm like, I run the server here. After this question, I'm going to start over.

143
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,289
Everyone's going to be mad. I'm going to disconnect everybody. I'm the server.

144
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,210
I'm just hosting this for people.

145
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,710
Fucking damn it, man. Right at the very beginning too. How could I possibly screw it up?

146
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:47,109
But, um, cookie. Okay. What'd you pick? You did a bad job.

147
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,910
Well, now we can, we can correct our mistake from beginning.

148
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:05,859
I just spit all of my fucking screen. God fucking damn it. I'm so upset right now. You have no idea

149
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:10,619
how mad I am. Not at the, I mean, whatever. I screwed up. I spit all, this is a new monitor.

150
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:19,849
New monitors in front of me. All right. So this time, first of all, cookie has given a hundred

151
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:25,880
dollars. Uh, cookie says, German, we know you screwed up. It's okay. We love you. Anyways,

152
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:33,369
big hearts all around. Have some more money. Cutie. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, thank you.

153
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,700
Thanks a lot, cookie. Well, let's go back in. I, I'm not going to fuck this up again.

154
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,160
So you can wait here. We're going to the chance of, I'm going to, I do want to mod in because it's

155
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,109
fun to get one for the first game. We're going to have mods, right? Like I'm going to put like

156
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:59,109
a weird body slider in and like pull his eyebrows off. Okay. Don't show the fucking room code.

157
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:06,309
Some critics say isn't a real service. It's just a framing device for a video. Okay. These are

158
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:12,309
entitled to their opinions and their privacy. So don't go looking for them. They're fine.

159
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:20,359
Okay. That's that. Let's make sure we get, I gotta, I have to go into. That's very important.

160
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,869
I almost did it again. With my old streaming service, I can never get a hold of a customer

161
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:32,549
service representative. Now that I'm a binge pipe customer, they never leave me alone.

162
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,150
I gotta make sure I get it right. I almost just said the name of the room I love.

163
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,230
We're grateful for their ever seeing eye. The second my binge pipe router went out requires

164
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:46,230
Twitch to log in. I have Twitch. Hold on. I gotta like open up another fucking browser.

165
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:59,910
What's the fucking code? Thank you, binge pipe.

166
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:06,630
I am logged in.

167
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:18,970
Twitch. Am I in? I'm in. I'm in. I'm in as Twitch. All right. I'm in as Twitch.

168
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:30,150
All right. Here we go. I'm in Twitch. I'm in. All right.

169
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:42,700
Good luck everybody. And we are full. Welcome everybody. Thanks for playing. Here we are.

170
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,329
All right. Everybody's in. Sit back and relax. I'm in. Everybody's in, right?

171
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:02,839
That's me, right? That's not like another person. How do I get this back over here?

172
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:10,140
Snack on this content. All right. We can play now. Finally. I'm Cookie Masterson. And if my mom

173
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,420
could see me now, I'd say, what are you doing, mom? I need a note jacked. While I hosted this game.

174
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,099
Everyone in? I didn't think you knew this many people. And I see we've got some gawkers.

175
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:29,339
All right. So we've got two mods, grump and no super you. And then we've got a bunch of other

176
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:40,940
random people. All right. Now we start for real. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for being so

177
00:23:40,940 --> 00:24:00,599
patient. Thanks for being so patient, guys. All right. I do.

178
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:11,400
I don't want to. So hold on a second. If after taking a sociology class,

179
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,700
that's not even a, this is even a question. It's not even a real question.

180
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,980
I mean, I know the answer, but that what kind of question is that? Can't do anything right. Can you

181
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:33,099
more ease folkways and laws are for cultural norms. Ethics can only help shape norms.

182
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,180
Okay. Although drinking 12 beers a night also has an effect on the shape of norms.

183
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,980
And how would our lovely audience do? Oh, just what I look for in an audience. 25% correct.

184
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,140
That means that right answer is worth even more. 700 of you. You can thank me later.

185
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:59,079
All right. Here we go. No, I don't want another question. I want one of these weird things.

186
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,279
Take a good look. How is this not safe for work? You know, the weird thing about the novel,

187
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,079
the three musketeers is there's a fourth musketeer wandering around that wasn't this one,

188
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:15,079
the not safe for work one started talking about it. If the musketeer left out of the umbrella term,

189
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,279
three musketeers angrily trademarked their own candy bar, what could they call it?

190
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:27,319
What could they call it? The port, those peanut chew Maurice's Milky way or d'Artagnan's date bar.

191
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:41,259
What? I don't, I don't, these are like computer generated

192
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:46,940
Google questions that an AI decided. It will never go near something called Lumiere's nut log.

193
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:54,859
Oh, what not safe for work. The three musketeers, but he spends the whole book as musketeer number

194
00:25:54,859 --> 00:26:06,259
four. It's all right. I got $744. All right. Super hot aliens for those Huey and Martin short.

195
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:14,940
I got it right. 35%. Wow. How do we get to do these cool ones down here?

196
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,180
Mixed tapes and marmalade. And what goes with that better than a dis or dat.

197
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:27,099
Dis or dat. I'm going to list seven things. And for each one, you tell me if it's something that

198
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:32,460
happened to Paddington bear in the delightful family film, Paddington two, something that

199
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,019
happened to rapper Lil Wayne in real life. Okay. Don't think too hard. But I mean both.

200
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:45,660
Give you a few seconds to decide between Paddington. Spoilers for Paddington bear.

201
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:53,160
And you're all doing this together. So let's do it. No, I don't want to see that born in New

202
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:06,569
Orleans. Um, I don't know. I raised by his aunt Lucy. Uh, no, I don't know. It could be both

203
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:16,980
worked. It was Paddington bear, a window cleaner. It was, uh, this, this has got to be some story

204
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:26,019
where Paddington bear. Oh shit. I didn't answer. I don't, why would Paddington bear is not a human

205
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:34,579
being. So no, that's Paddington bear. That's Paddington bear. That's not Lil Wayne.

206
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:44,569
Was in a coma. Uh, I don't think Lil Wayne was ever in a coma. What? When was Lil Wayne in a coma?

207
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:51,450
You can't spell disastrous without us, but you, why he was, you just plain sucked at that desert.

208
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,130
Holy shit. Binge pipe customer retention protocol has been activated.

209
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,210
Sounds like it's screw time. That is the truth cookie. Use the screw to make answering a question

210
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,730
harder for all the other players. The results may surprise you and you'll receive a bonus for

211
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:16,250
anyone who answers incorrectly. This is like an ADHD computer. Use them wisely or don't you do you.

212
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:31,130
The question that doesn't care. Are you kidding me? See that, what, but that sentence

213
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:40,410
is hurting me. Stig Larsen. The answer of course is Stefan Edberg. It did in 20th century

214
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:52,680
Dov Lundgren is the guy from Rocky. No, that's not him. Uh, I don't know.

215
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:07,369
Oh, I just gave everybody an answer. Dov Lundgren did not found Ikea. No wait, Dov Lundgren is the

216
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:11,529
WWE guy. Oh no, that's another Dov.

217
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:27,619
Uh, what is sex? Oh, that's why you can't join it.

218
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:51,380
What? Oh, he made it harder. I don't understand. They just made it hard to read?

219
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,990
No, I just picked the wrong one because I got screwed. I just picked the wrong one.

220
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:06,710
It's incorrect on this side.

221
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,279
That's the whole point. Yeah, well why are we giving people in Jack Puck's party pack?

222
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:26,819
The blue turtle shell from Mario Kart is trivia questions, man.

223
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:36,329
Currently player four is in the lead. All right, Drosophilia doing all right.

224
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:43,849
These players are making everyone feel bad. So here comes the screws. And don't forget. Oh,

225
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:49,210
more screws. And they'll net you more cash for each player that gets the question wrong. So

226
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,730
don't be afraid to use them. The rest of you better answer quick. Screw this entire game.

227
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,490
Remember questions are worth twice as much. Oh, plus two. What are you trying to say?

228
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,009
Just wonderful cookie.

229
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,259
Try this on for size. Turtles all the way down.

230
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,460
Going by the divine comedy. Are there more levels of hell or seasons of entourage?

231
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,019
More levels of hell or seasons of entourage? There is more entourage.

232
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,940
So watch out. What the fuck?

233
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,819
I'm just trying to answer the question. Don't forget your password.

234
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:40,359
What is the password? We have to put a password in. What? Did I get it? Wrong password.

235
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,250
I can't even type the password in right. According to Dante, there are nine levels of hell,

236
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:57,980
but there are only eight seasons of entourage. I did type the phrase and I couldn't get it.

237
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:08,859
What is entourage? It's when Mark Wahlberg showed on camera

238
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:17,740
how cool his life is. That's the whole show. That's actually the entire show.

239
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,299
There's nothing else to that show besides Mark Wahlberg has a really cool life.

240
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:35,180
While solving a mystery all the game spoilers the tag of his collar floating in a pool of blood.

241
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:40,299
How do they know it's his? It's shaped like a paw print. It's shaped like a scooby snack.

242
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:46,059
It's shaped like his head or it has his initials on it. What is on scooby-doo's collar? I think

243
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,059
it's it has his initials on it. Stop giving people answers.

244
00:32:50,059 --> 00:33:04,440
I forgot you could hear me.

245
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,759
Congratulations everybody.

youtube group that was called polaris it was like 5 000 youtubers if you decided to start you were

267
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,039
right shapes which would offer the most stable relationship who offers the most stable relationship

268
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:26,840
the charming rhombus the passionate circle or the hunky triangle no no no i know this one

269
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,750
oh in emote only mode because of uh answers

270
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:40,889
is it what it's not the rhombus the rhombus has like the legs in that

271
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:48,809
triangles are the strongest and most stable of the shapes no it's not that's bullshit and the

272
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:54,889
rhombus has the why they cut pizza right out bottom because it will never ever let you down

273
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:58,650
that's a big they did it because they want to make a pizza reference

274
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:06,679
pizza should be cut into rhombus shapes you made it to the attack

275
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,320

00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,320
yes even in a nebulous void democracy is important at the end of the yes you do not need the game to

322
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:59,239
play the most divisive you just need to go to the browser got it good now let's begin you don't have

323
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:05,559
to have the game you just have to have a browser on a tablet phone browser Abraham Lincoln never

324
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:12,920
existed in another he existed but he wore a fedora it's time to split the room what

329
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:20,949
just waiting for the vote when we're gonna see why it was a good idea to add the extended timers

330
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:36,809
there it is 30 seconds and now split the room banned but not forgotten chapter one of nine has

331

in order to get one uh the government has just outlawed me a friend introduces you to the black

333
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,940
market do you risk significant jail time in order to get to be able to watch the stream

334
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:13,750
i mean i can't i don't want to influence this vote or anything but i mean unless i'm i know i'm

335
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:23,059
not going to influence the vote i'll take one germa please on one hand though i mean

336
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:31,019
maybe if i was made out of gold right i'm not currently but maybe you'd really enjoy the stream

337
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:46,260
but i'm not made out of gold so the longer it takes the room to answer the more bonus points

00:49:47,320 --> 00:50:03,559
the sheep go just go next door you don't have to worry about it there we go and he split the room

347
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:21,030
i split the room brace yourself for the compliment bible i said that loud and i

348
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:25,750
typed nice thing anyone has ever said about you and who said it for every nice book looking at

349
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:31,269
the book you have to spend a minute looking at looking at do you spend 10 minutes reading it

350
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:37,110
is a well is a book full of every nice thing anyone's ever said about you i don't want to

351
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:52,329
know that for every minute you spend look at what i mean that's not i mean i don't want to

352
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,659
why would you want a book that has everything that someone said about you nice you know what

353
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:01,320
i mean like if you open it up you're gonna then you're gonna start to pretty much think

354
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:07,559
about what they're saying oh wow i really think jeremy's hair is so nice i really hope he doesn't

355
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,960
cut his hair ever it's the nicest hair oh jeremy's hair is so nice it's like i can't cut my hair ever

356
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,070
again what if i get a haircut i got short haircut and then that person is not in the book anymore

357
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,269
i'm flipping through freaking out like wait wait no one's talking about the hair anymore

358
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:31,159
they hate it you wouldn't see the yo because it would disappear because it would be gone

359
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:42,409
because that person wouldn't write it presents yes go i'm trying to work the room don't you

360

361
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:52,489
think it's you their work is good but they have one strange tick they do this do you

362
00:51:55,659 --> 00:52:00,300
so for five dollars an hour you can hire i could hire an impersonator to stream for me

363
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:07,099
everyone will just think it's me their work is very good but they have one they dab all spontaneously

01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,780
oh what do you settle for doorways only five feet tall or a dad on the walls

419
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:57,980
five foot tall doorways really are fucking that sucks that really sucks got the correct prediction

420
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:06,389
too let's switch things up you and four other patrons at a buffet restaurant are being at a

421
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:11,670
buffet if you eat everything that's left in an hour you'll be let go you either drink a gallon

422
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:18,469
of gravy or this food which food for your life nobody can drink a gallon of gravy

423
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:37,059
a gallon gravy with 10 pounds of mashed potatoes no you can't physically eat 10

424
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:48,360
pounds of mashed potatoes you'll die you're all gross you'll die if you eat this no dice

425
01:03:52,500 --> 01:04:01,610
you don't know me you'd die i i picked that in a second it took me one second to pick that

426
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:07,610
the second that door opened i it took me a second to click on the answer

427
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:18,710
gallon gravy or a can of worms i would eat the can of worms in a fucking second

428
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:25,909
are you kidding me a gallon of gravy versus just deal with just eating a can of worms and get to

429
01:04:26,869 --> 01:05:00,230
whose ass i don't understand does it matter i mean kind of moving on you need to rent a car

430
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:05,699
and the only rental vehicles plastered with advertisements you can rent a car advertising

431
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:22,679
a gentleman's club or this which car ad do you drive around with which car nobody even knows

432
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:33,429

433
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:37,510
the 4 000 people here know what that is but if you're driving around at a rental car

you put too many syllables too many words in the first line

807
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:56,709
my arms are fresh like right near the deal oh boy that's uh

808
02:28:06,409 --> 02:28:31,000
the game crashed the game crashed get disconnected i didn't do it oh the game

809
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:38,540
it's fucking crashed oh dear what was your line what was your rap luke

810
02:28:46,069 --> 02:29:04,389
why is jack box crashing what is here to crash well um luke is the new green screen

811
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:14,709
too many graphics well i think we're gonna do i think that that was any time as any

812
02:29:14,709 --> 02:29:26,340
to open up uh party pack four do i have party pack four it crashed for me as well that's annoying

813
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:46,600
do i not have this how did i play this before no i i i already own this was it on ps4 i might

814
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:58,549
have i might have owned it on ps4 yeah i think it's on ps4 oh maybe not hold on maybe i might

815
02:29:58,549 --> 02:30:07,129
be on the wrong thing here no yeah you your account already owns this game so how why can

816
02:30:07,129 --> 02:30:16,069
i not install it it's weird no it was telling me oh you can purchase it but it's weird all right

817
02:30:16,069 --> 02:30:26,899
let's just get party pack four go on here that's so annoying that one's definitely the best one i

818
02:30:26,979 --> 02:30:32,569
think maybe we need some other people in like a voice to do the other games so i'm just gonna

819
02:30:32,569 --> 02:30:50,680
put this up temporarily while i get this going give me one second here's jack box i yeah i have

820
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:55,719
all of them the only i don't have is two i don't have two so for some reason i have every single

821
02:30:55,719 --> 02:31:07,239
one but two the other one is you give presentations so it's way better when people are talking yeah

822
02:31:07,239 --> 02:31:16,280
that's that's true is it the same site jack box four it is the same site for all of them so you

823
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:30,219
are good to go i'm opening it i'm going to mute the audio here because it's probably gonna be

824
02:31:30,219 --> 02:31:35,180
very loud so opening party pack four probably should change the title to party pack four

825
02:31:38,569 --> 02:31:54,329
it is very loud so all right oh yeah we got fibbage three save the internet full screen mode

826
02:31:54,329 --> 02:32:02,889

03:41:55,290 --> 03:42:03,129
just love a god all right moving on

1122
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:24,120
round two and it was 400 pounds that's right there's a 450 pound television the start of some kind

1123
03:42:24,120 --> 03:42:59,180
of circle or maybe a um an ear that was quick uh see see see you or a face that was really quick

1124
03:42:59,180 --> 03:43:23,159
and it's it's the baseline here where you going with it get jexed so i need to add to this

1125
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:46,950
good luck to you too make it happen uh chat chat rules and then a sans eye sans eye on the right

1126
03:43:47,979 --> 03:44:01,620
and then chat rules on the left and a tooth i think i think a sans eye at this point is

1127
03:44:01,620 --> 03:44:13,319
an automatic disqualification does that make any sense i think that breaks the rules at this point

1128
03:44:23,670 --> 03:44:31,989
all right so chat rules which appears chat rules all right how can i add to this let me think

1129
03:45:09,860 --> 03:45:23,979
it's a puppet it's a puppet or a screaming powerful spell moment of truth plus the audience

1130
03:45:25,530 --> 03:45:35,850
let's see pretty even actually pretty even but and then 10 shits it looks like we're going

1131
03:45:35,850 --> 03:45:46,780
with a puppet up next chat rules now is that supposed to be somebody that's okay so here

1132
03:45:46,780 --> 03:45:57,510
this is what i'm assuming here chat drools well see that the you the chat you are the the person

1133
03:45:57,510 --> 03:46:05,110
there right and the puppet is your avatar on the internet and you're essentially talking through

1134
03:46:05,110 --> 03:46:11,780
that so this this is this could be made into a very very good piece actually uh chat drools with

1135
03:46:12,969 --> 03:46:28,280
not no memes no like random was that

1136
03:46:35,100 --> 03:47:18,729

1643
05:21:52,250 --> 05:22:01,860
it would ever become an issue is if it starts to become too much you know what i mean so

1644

1647
05:22:24,220 --> 05:22:27,419
if we have to figure out what to do then we have to figure out what to do if the minimum has to

1648
05:22:27,500 --> 05:22:32,939
increase if that has to happen i try to wait as long as possible before we need to do something
