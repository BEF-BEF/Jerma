1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:28,559
How do you do? How are you? Yeah.

2
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,559
We don't have to do a survival mode or anything.

3
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:40,049
I just want to go see the new arcade. We're in coin game now.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:55,229
Did you take a lap around the room to calm down? Yeah, kind of.

5
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:08,769
So I paced a little bit. All right, let me get into here. This looks good.

6
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:20,120
That looks good. All right. So where's the new arcade? I'm in birthday mode.

7
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:36,590
I'm going to need to add this. Oh, there it is. Okay.

8
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,730
So anyone know where the new arcade is? I have my map, right?

9
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,769
You drive cars now or no, just not really. He really did get filtered.

10
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,650
No, I went through the filter and I passed through as clean water.

11
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,150
I got through it. I beat that boss. Go look at the, just go rewind, rewind.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:14,849
I know you didn't believe it. I know you don't think it's real. I beat it. Uh,

13
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,789
okay. So I think it's the mall. I'm looking for the mall. Uh, yep.

14
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,750
Happy birthday. There it is. The mall. Oh shit. We're just going in the limo.

15
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,479
Cool. Let's go. Can you tell us please what liquid reflexes mean?

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,969
I, you're going to have to ask the person that said that. I don't know.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,219
Whoever said that to you. I don't know. We made it. All right.

18
00:02:45,219 --> 00:03:01,300
We made it to the mall. You said that that's, that's not provable. All right.

19
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,139
So here's the new area. Cool. You said it. You did. That's not proof.

20
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,500
That's not proof. Prove it. Then it was on this stream. You're taking,

21
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,300
talk about something I said, like two, three years ago,

22
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,930
like and you're taking it out of context. Now, what the heck?

23
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:30,080
Yeah. It was literally 32 minutes ago. What the, what the hell dude?

24
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:37,509
Ah, Gary, I'm sorry. I can do better than that.

25
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,180
Pirate pizza. Jerry's gourmet. Sammy's vacant.

26
00:03:50,229 --> 00:04:06,039
Let's go sit there. Let's go. Can I buy jewelry? Oh,

27
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:20,709
I'm trying to take them. How do I get those? Can I buy anything here?

28
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,660
Ask for price, gold, fronts, iced, anything, custom rings.

29
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:41,360
Can I ask? Can I just say, hold on. Yeah. I can't just break it.

30
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:50,949
Arcade arcade castle. Let's go. There's apparently some new stuff.

31
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:15,689
I have 300 bucks. I didn't make it. You gotta go.

32
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,850
You gotta get the spot and just do only hundreds.

33
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,029
I'm going to say red is lined up right at the bottom. Let's go all the way green.

34
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,579
No, I'll get it. And I'll do every single one.

35
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,949
Red lined up right here at the bottom or the edge. Go that many green.

36
00:05:37,189 --> 00:06:01,790
A little bit more. Am I aiming too high? Okay. Yeah. I'm aiming too high.

37
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,800
You can't use them. You can't say filter in here. All right. What was that?

38
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:33,180
Red lined up right here. All the way green. Maybe one yellow.

39
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm going to get all fifties. Here we go.

40
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,629
Do the top armored course streamer right now. I might as well be playing it.

41
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:32,170
This is just as hard. It's it's inconsistent. I think you have to move with it.

42
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:47,769
I'll take a hundred points. That's fine. That's bad. Isn't it? Hey, all right.

43
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,209
That was fun. I was never good at ski ball.

44
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:11,819
Add a mech cockpit overlay. Can somebody just give me one that has opacity?

45
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:35,940
Oh, I'm good at this one. I'm not going to mess it up. I'll get it.

46
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,460
I'm my finger got crushed. Ow, my finger got crushed.

47
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:05,610
Can we put the, can we put the, all right, here's what I want.

48
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,750
I want, I want the, the crosshair in the middle.

49
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,789
And I want all the HUD information. I don't want like the guns on the side.

50
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,809
I want,

51
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:39,019
I'm walking around at a mech with all the little UI information. The game lagged.

52
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:54,039
You actually saw that happen. I'm seeing a lot of copiums, but it really did.

53
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:17,779
The hell's going on here. It's hard mode. Makes the game just way harder.

54
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:42,490
I got lucky there, but it worked. Shit.

55
00:10:48,169 --> 00:11:33,100
I was so waiting for it to lag that I was in my own head. The lag,

56
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,179
even with the lag, I still, I had it. The lag,

57
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,860
I was going to scream something. I was going to say like, what the, but no,

58
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:52,220
let's chill. I ended up being fine. Almost clutched it. Yeah. Almost.

59
00:11:53,259 --> 00:12:27,860
Not quite though. I get it. Clutched it. Feel good about that one.

60
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:41,110
How many tickets was it? Ooh, that's a lot. How many? 2000 tickets. Holy shit.

61
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:50,409
That's a lot. What did I get for this one? 162. That's not bad. All right.

62
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:58,230
What is this? So this is like a coin thing. Coin pusher. All right.

63
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,980
What am I looking for? I want, um, yeah, I want 120 coins.

64
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,059
All right. I have 120. So what am I trying to do here?

65
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:23,399
I'm trying to just drop stuff. You got it. Load it up.

66
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:51,220
The blue are worth a hundred. So what do I get for points? All right.

67
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,759
Stomp the mermaids space. What is it? How do I get the bonus?

68
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,029
Play the one with the ball. I'll play the one with the ball. Give me one sec.

69
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:28,179
This is your best content. 50. I'm going for the,

70
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,500
I'm going with the 50 right here. It's a hundred tickets, right?

71
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:42,039
I don't have to pick these up, right? There we go. I got 50 points.

72
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
I tried it. I'm going to try to get one of the hundreds. This one's the closest.

73
00:14:46,639 --> 00:15:16,340
We're going to spam over here. Hundred incoming. Here it is. Oh shit.

74
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:25,830
I'm out of money. Oh, it's my birthday. I'll be all right. It's a little bit loud.

75
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,960
Uh, I'll take care of that. Give me one sec. That should be better.

76
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:51,899
All right. Let's skillfully do this now. Happy birthday. Hey, thanks.

77
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:14,379
Just want the a hundred and I'm good. Just dangling. Come on. Wait, see,

78
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:22,429
stop. Oh, I get it. Maybe if I get five points in,

79
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,950
let's see what happens when that five goes in, will it move five paces?

80
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:42,840
Come on, come on. All right. I need one more five. That'll do it right here.

81
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:59,409
That's two fives, but Oh, that's unfortunate.

82
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,799
All right. That five right there. That'll do it. Don't drop the 10,

83
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:23,450
drop the five right in this corner. Watch this. There it is. All right. Bonus.

84
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:32,809
I got a 237 tickets. Did you get the mech yet? Uh, there's one,

85
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,369
I have one in the mods have sent me, but that's more like,

86
00:17:38,329 --> 00:18:00,880
I want like a spaceship. Look, look at all the tickets. I'm getting another bonus.

87
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:12,240
Whoa. 800 tickets. Oh, you've got 800 tickets there.

88
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:24,150
Oh, give it a spin. Oh, a thousand tickets. Yeah.

89
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,789
Okay. I know this one. I'm good at this one.

90
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:51,420
Let it go around once. Hmm. They may have patched this.

91
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:14,460
It's possible. This was patched. Shit. Shit. Shit.

92
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:35,299
Shit. Shit. Dude, dude, dude, I just,

93
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:42,299
I just got 385 tickets on that machine. Do you want to hang out? Hey, Hey,

94
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:44,819
Hey, do you want to hang out with me?

95
00:19:44,819 --> 00:20:02,180
I just got 400 tickets on the machine to look. Don't for it again. Oh,

96
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:12,700
almost. Oh, Hey, two to eight, two in a row.

97
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,339
Hold on a second. This is, this is a kind of like, what is this?

98
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,819
Is this from fallout? Like what is this even from? What game is this from?

99
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:48,109
Hold on. Okay. There is a mask in here, so that's good. Okay.

100
00:20:50,490 --> 00:21:01,490
So now here we go. What even is this from?

101
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,029
I have to act like a spacecraft, right? This is, this is mech warrior.

102
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:30,660
Let's go really, really organic limbs that this mech has weird.

103
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:45,299
It's not lined up that better. Shit.

104
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,089
Add a bunch of robot sounds in the background. Yeah, that has to be there.

105
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:06,140
Robot walking sound effects, giant robot walking. Oh, let me,

106
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:29,069
this might be loud. Hold on. The robot mic. Can I even do that here?

107
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:46,549
Hold on. Does this, uh, does this work? Does this work? How are we doing? Okay.

108
00:22:47,930 --> 00:23:03,210
Okay. Let me just turn it around. Okay. Let's go for it. This one looks good.

109
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:13,960
It looks okay. Uh, now I will play this one.

110
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,480
We need tickets, tickets, tickets, tickets. Tickets.

111
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,420
Almost, almost a hundred. One more, one more, one more.

112
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:48,549
Almost a hundred. Is it loud? Oh, it is loud. Why is it so loud?

113
00:23:52,759 --> 00:24:00,519
How did that get so loud? Is it better?

114
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:36,990
Candy, do you guys have Charleston shoes?

115
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:57,660
I'm not going to be able to see you. Okay. Was it really that loud?

116
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:10,460
That looked like it was kind of loud. Hopefully it wasn't too bad. It was okay.

117
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,880
Pick those up. Those are my tickets. It was incomprehensible.

118
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:31,079
What is this one? Oh, it's one of these. I know how to play these.

119
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:40,019
You have to like push them down, right? Oh, tickets to your right.

120
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:58,460
There's a thousand tickets on the ground where I don't see them. Oh, there they are.

121
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:16,180
That's not a thousand. That was 40. I want to get that cow.

122
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:34,259
There's more in there. Ooh, tickets. I want this cow. I've played these though.

123
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,059
You have to, you don't try to go for the grab. You try to push it over.

124
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,799
You don't actually want to pick it up. All right, there we go. That's good.

125
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:51,769
That's good. That's actually a big deal. Okay. Now we go from the behind here.

126
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,400
I just want to kind of nudge it. I don't want to pick it up.

127
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,789
Actually, it might be fine. I definitely got it. There it is.

128
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:17,539
I got the cow. Nice. Let me look at it.

129
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,589
I'd like to sell this for more coins.

130
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:42,700
I played this one before. This one's fun. Put it back in the machine.

131
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,150
I know there's another one. Oh, yes.

132
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,309
A hundred percent. This is the worst machine in the Intel.

133
00:27:49,309 --> 00:28:02,900
I almost said casino. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo.

134
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:37,670
What? Oh, shit. It lagged.

135
00:28:37,670 --> 00:29:12,299
I want those headphones. Yay. Headphones.

136
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:21,650
I'll take that. I can definitely sell these for a lot of money.

137
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,180
All right. What's this one?

138
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:36,500
Ticket. Oh, I think you get tickets on your forty eight hundred.

139
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:43,930
I just a moment. What do you mean? Moment.

140
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:49,180
And they remove those.

141
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:56,420
I thought they got rid of moments.

142
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,470
Let me get the mega jackpot.

143
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:07,950
I'll take mystery ball to if he's good.

144
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,029
They didn't remove them yet.

145
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:18,109
Oh, I see. I just got the jackpot.

146
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:22,029
Oh, shit. Nice. OK.

147
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:29,259
I still have two balls.

148
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,220
Give us moments before they remove them.

149
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:37,900
I just wait. Bonus round.

150
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,759
I want that mega jackpot.

151
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:47,730
All right.

152
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,950
Yoshi, get in there.

153
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,339
I got another bonus round.

154
00:30:55,339 --> 00:31:06,609
Yay. Yay. I think I did it.

155
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:07,529
That was fun.

156
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:09,769
That required no skill at all.

157
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:15,819
I just watched. Perfect game.

158
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,029
All right. There's another room over here.

159
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,799
I think there's a couple more games that we have not seen.

160
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:27,539
Otto. Oh, it's called Octo Swirl.

161
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:35,519
How does this one work?

162
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,089
Ah, right. I always hated these.

163
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,970
He's always felt so particular.

164
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,769
And I'll take 300 tickets, though.

165
00:31:50,769 --> 00:32:01,369
All right. One more.

166
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:02,930
A jackpot is going to be really hard to hit.

167
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:10,339
2000. Pretty good.

168
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:15,099
Oh, there's a Halloween one over here.

169
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,869
Pumpkin pusher.

170
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,019
Ah, here it is.

171
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:21,200
Here it is.

172
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,779
This is probably the most popular thing in any arcade.

173
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,420
All right.

174
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,779
So the whole thing with this, you have to collect these pumpkin balls.

175
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,619
I've never heard of this one.

176
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,740
There are different things in different arcades.

177
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,019
There's a lot of different variety here.

178
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,700
I mean, I don't really go to the arcade that frequently,

179
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,990
but every time I've gone to the arcade, which is probably two or three times

180
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,900
in the last year or two, these were occupied.

181
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:10,700
All of them. These were all occupied.

182
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,789
What I get.

183
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:20,980
OK, I need to get I want another pumpkin.

184
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,240
All right. I want I need to get at least a few of those in there.

185
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:31,220
It's all about just spamming.

186
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,849
It looks like there's skill here, but it's just just throw dice in the air.

187
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
You can guide it a little. Not really.

188
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,299
All right. There's another one.

189
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:49,740
I think when you get to a few more, it should be the bonus of the pumpkin.

190
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,059
Yeah. You want to try to get in the middle there.

191
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:57,140
You can because that puts another pumpkin ball in.

192
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,039
Or if you do that, it just shoots other little balls in.

193
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,109
What's the what is it? Yellow.

194
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,819
Can't read. What is this going to do?

195
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:09,010
Oh, OK. How's my skin doing?

196
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,530
It's a it's very hydrated.

197
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:21,480
It's very healthy. All stuck.

198
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,719
All right. Here we go. Here comes one.

199
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,880
This is the stuck one. All right.

200
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,030
Push it down. Let's go.

201
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,469
I'll take another yellow.

202
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:40,460
Oh, it's OK.

203
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,650
All right. Get it down there.

204
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,369
I have two more credits.

205
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:53,050
All right.

206
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,349
Oh, that's all right.

207
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:58,239
I keep going.

208
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,280
What do you think? Should I just try to get as many of these as I can?

209
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:12,030
Yeah, we got to get the bonus. We have to.

210
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:19,760
I got to get the mega jackpot.

211
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,920
I got to get more orange balls.

212
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,280
So just wait till they are in the middle.

213
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,619
That's made the most sense.

214
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,900
You should do one more AC boss before bed.

215
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:37,610
That was a good idea.

216
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,650
Do you understand how long I was biting my tongue,

217
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,530
desperately wanting to just scream about the game?

218
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,670
And I knew that I was up against that bet.

219
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,869
So that kept me that kept my cool for a long time.

220
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:57,460
We should do that every single time

221
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:07,090
because that that keeps me honest.

222
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,769
Try it again with the mech overlay.

223
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:11,170
You want to put the mech overlay on top of the mech overlay

224
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,539
or was it the mega jackpot?

225
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:28,780
What did I say?

226
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,429
Has any human beaten this game yet?

227
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,829
And here's the thing I know that people have.

228
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,650
Look at this.

229
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,489
What's going on here? Look at this.

230
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,070
Look at this.

231
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,699
Oh, something's happening.

232
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:47,289
Did I do it?

233
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:56,860
It's pumpkin time.

234
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:06,039
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

235
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,650
That's two balls and then a three going in.

236
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,769
All right. This is that was cool.

237
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:20,050
You broke the machine.

238
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,369
All right. Look at the yellow.

239
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:25,219
Yellow is 200.

240
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:28,070
Now what? Just fill them all up.

241
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,789
What happens if I get yellow again?

242
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,030
Oh, I got it. OK.

243
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:43,989
It was 250.

244
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,909
So if you fill one all the way to the top.

245
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,150
Oh, it's orange is the one I want.

246
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,809
We got a pumpkin party, though.

247
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:59,039
Hey, guys, we've got a pumpkin party.

248
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:11,300
Nobody even came to my birthday party.

249
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,019
I like this one. This one's fun.

250
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:15,460
You always go to 5000 every time.

251
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:32,019
All right. We're going to do 5000 three times in a row.

252
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,199
This is kid roulette. It really is.

253
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,400
I had one of these in a local arcade.

254
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:41,809
And I'm telling you right now,

255
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:44,409
I would just sit there and it'd be like, oh, come on, come on.

256
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:48,820
It's going to be green this time.

257
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,260
I may as well have had a cigar in my mouth just sitting there.

258
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,239
No, no, no. Everybody's got to go blue

259
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
or it's going to fuck it up for everybody here.

260
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:04,719
Everybody go blue.

261
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,719
Actually, I think in the old ones you could pick every color if you wanted to.

262
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,019
It just was a credit.

263
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,059
So you could effectively do every single one.

264
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,099
And I think just light up the whole thing.

265
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:27,920
Little green.

266
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:36,539
It had a similar soundtrack to this, too.

267
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:42,119
There it is. Oh, crap for kids.

268
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,300
Just have white come up once.

269
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,539
Remember, if you don't give us a baby green character, we will riot.

270
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,250
I mean, but you want a baby green.

271
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:30,039
Oh, OK. I feel like that's the movie deal that I got.

272
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,840
And I hate it.

273
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,320
No, we don't want you to be Mr.

274
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Greens. We want you to be Mr.

275
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,820
Greens as a six year old.

276
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,510
Oh, OK. OK, I guess.

277
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,039
No, we don't want Bugleberry.

278
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,260
We want Bugleberry in college.

279
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,400
Oh, OK.

280
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't really want to.

281
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,219
That sounds way better.

282
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:30,840
Oh, Bugleberry's backstory.

283
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,820
All right. I'm I'm walking.

284
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,340
Chat gets to press a button as a treat.

285
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,119
All right. Which one?

286
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,309
Which one you want to press?

287
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:59,179
Red, green, blue, yellow or white?

288
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:14,179
Which one? Better call Bugleberry.

289
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,179
How's it looking?

290
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,179
You're all saying white.

291
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,500
So it's I pressed yellow and I didn't mean to do that.

292
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,739
I clicked back in the window.

293
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:29,820
So hopefully it's not white.

294
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,340
If it is, I'm going to leave.

295
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,679
It's going to be sad.

296
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:45,670
All right. We all lose. So who cares?

297
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,710
All right. One more white for chat.

298
00:42:49,909 --> 00:43:04,460
And then we're going to play the other game.

299
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,980
What did I say earlier? Cut the crap.

300
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,699
Oh, this one's fun, too.

301
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:33,969
I love this one.

302
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:35,329
Thousand. All right.

303
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:36,610
Can I? This is free.

304
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:48,469
Thousand tickets.

305
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:55,559
All right. I'm going to get 10,000 tickets next to me earlier.

306
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:09,260
The bonus is random.

307
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:20,219
That's weird. 1392.

308
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:21,989
Shit. You got to be.

309
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:27,500
I got to be more impressive than this.

310
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,730
Ah, where's Dizzy Bird?

311
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,340
I will play at least 30 games of Dizzy Bird before I leave.

312
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,849
All right. I promise I will play at least 40 games of Dizzy Bird

313
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:50,420
before I am done with the arcade.

314
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,940
That's a realistic number.

315
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:59,780
And that's one that I know I can hit.

316
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,210
Another 1400.

317
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,250
Dude, what does your stream title mean half the time?

318
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:07,460
I don't know, because I make a stream title

319
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,380
and then I have that window is over here and it's closed off.

320
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,280
And then my moderators take turns.

321
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,449
You're rating me in my title.

322
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:27,619
So I have no idea what it says right now.

323
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:35,559
What does it say now?

324
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,260
What does it say?

325
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,260
It's an automatic coin pusher game.

326
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,610
Pocket change at 50 percent.

327
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,659
Pocket change at 30 percent.

328
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:47,860
No tickets remaining.

329
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,889
I'm sorry, Raven.

330
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,099
Who's Raven?

331
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:55,980
Is that from Armored Core?

332
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:08,289
Oh, it's one of the Armored Core characters.

333
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:11,150
It's you.

334
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:18,980
Yeah, but it's me.

335
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:23,380
It's like you didn't even play Armored Core.

336
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,300
I you just saw me beat the hottest boss in the game.

337
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:50,550
Somebody else was playing.

338
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,269
Hey, you got what you wanted out of that.

339
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,940
You got at least three or four.

340
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,949
And then I complained about From Software for like 15 straight minutes.

341
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:16,469
You got what you wanted.

342
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:17,269
Actually, no, I didn't.

343
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:20,559
I didn't complain about From Software.

344
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,960
I don't think I complained very much at all.

345
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,849
Did I complain? Not really.

346
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:29,130
I don't think it was a complaint.

347
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,219
Is he talking to us?

348
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:46,489
No, no. The person behind you.

349
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,130
All right. One more.

350
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,340
And I'm going to do that.

351
00:47:50,619 --> 00:48:03,070
What's it called? One more.

352
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,869
There we go. All right.

353
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:05,500
Now I can leave.

354
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:12,469
Probably about 10K, right?

355
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:13,829
Give the controller back to your wife.

356
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:16,710
She's way better at video games than you and has plus two RIS.

357
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:27,570
That's like five, six thousand.

358
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,139
Plus two RIS.

359
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,579
I didn't even see this thing.

360
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,460
What is this? I'm playing it.

361
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,139
Wait, there's other stuff here.

362
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:39,659
There's a ton of other shit here.

363
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,190
It's not time to go to Dizzy Bird yet.

364
00:48:44,190 --> 00:49:10,900
I hate this one, but I'll play it.

365
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
I had it. I had it.

366
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,820
If it didn't freeze, if it didn't freeze, I had it freeze.

367
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:46,909
Messed it up.

368
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:56,559
I think that's when you walk away from this one.

369
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,969
Oh, was it basketball in the original game?

370
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:05,019
I don't remember that.

371
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:22,469
Let's do it.

372
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,909
Everybody knows the only real way to play this game is you

373
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:29,300
and two other friends just pick up all of them at the same time.

374
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:36,190
And then everybody just kind of drops them over there at the same time.

375
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:48,989
I got the bonus round, though.

376
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:51,360
That's hard. Six thousand tickets.

377
00:50:52,380 --> 00:51:03,309
No, that's a this is one to play.

378
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,099
And then you're done. You don't play it again.

379
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:09,269
This one has a similar mindset to.

380
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:33,480
I wonder how does this work?

381
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,320
Oh, you have to hit the right.

382
00:51:36,320 --> 00:52:03,329
I forgot about the hell.

383
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,369
I got the exact same score.

384
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:11,619
Quagmire.

385
00:52:14,389 --> 00:52:53,039
I wish the trajectory on this one.

386
00:52:53,039 --> 00:53:04,530
That was pretty good.

387
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,809
I think you play against another player.

388
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:06,969
All right, let's kick this person's ass.

389
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,030
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

390
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:36,309
Let's play. Let's play.

391
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:37,789
Oh, don't laugh at that.

392
00:53:37,789 --> 00:54:01,550
Oh, it's not going to tell you're trying really hard because I am, too.

393
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:26,090
Get it. Why did you get so good all of a sudden?

394
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:48,820
Dude, how are you still home?

395
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:59,829
I still in this.

396
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:15,699
What is going on?

397
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:18,139
We're going to hit the enrage timer and the air is going to turn off.

398
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:31,469
OK, good.

399
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:37,980
I think you can actually hit that, by the way.

400
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,599
Can't you tune the game to make it so so people don't just sit around,

401
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:49,059
just hit it back and forth all day?

402
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:52,909
Oh, that's right. You can buy scratch tickets.

403
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:54,829
I'll do a little. I'll do a few scratch tickets.

404
00:55:54,829 --> 00:56:01,079
Why not? After we do this.

405
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:02,590
OK, that was good.

406
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:10,789
Oh, my God.

407
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:13,659
Do not come back and beat me.

408
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,539
What do you play?

409
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:25,900
This person got bored.

410
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,690
Is it to five or to seven?

411
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,659
Oh, I win.

412
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:39,300
Nice. 400. That's pretty good.

413
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,820
Have I played this one? Pile?

414
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,599
Does this one work?

415
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:53,079
Pile. Holy.

416
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,849
That's weird. This is weird.

417
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:11,219
This thing's very floaty.

418
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:17,559
OK, always start in the middle.

419
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,670
I got to get something on the left side, slightly on the left edge.

420
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,380
How was I ever supposed to do that?

421
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,260
Do it again. I get it now.

422
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,139
This feels like a jump scare is going to pop out any second.

423
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:41,670
All right. Now I get it.

424
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,670
I want to get at least.

425
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:49,480
Oh, that's kind of bad.

426
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:57,739
Hmm. It's OK.

427
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:05,619
OK, this last two were rough, but I'm good.

428
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,699
Hmm. A little too much on the left side.

429
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:23,940
Oh, that's bad.

430
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,789
I guess way too hard.

431
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:36,059
I guess too hard.

432
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:39,659
Well, I got all these saying spaghetti and garlic bread.

433
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,110
Oh, that sounds amazing.

434
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,579
Yeah, that sounds that that sounds like a great dinner.

435
00:58:50,019 --> 00:59:01,309
Is that what we're doing?

436
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,469
I just I just beat it.

437
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:11,820
I'm done. Get that bonus right in the middle.

438
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,710
Do it. Do it.

439
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:30,659
Oh, what just happened?

440
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:31,500
Right in the middle.

441
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:40,630
Yeah, that's not a small amount of tickets.

442
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,199
That's actually really good.

443
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:52,199
All right. Snowball battle.

444
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:54,179
Get ready.

445
00:59:54,179 --> 01:00:11,599
Oh, it's space invaders.

446
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,679
I get me out of this.

447
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,599
This always happens at any arcade I've ever gone to that has this cabinet.

448
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:21,900
Everybody points at it and everybody does like the

449
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,980
everybody has their mouth open pointing at space invaders.

450
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,260
One person puts a coin in to play it.

451
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,300
They die one time and walk away from the machine

452
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:36,550
because they don't want to play it a second time.

453
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,230
You realize, oh, I went, I've got I got two more lives.

454
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:43,789
Oh, anybody want to jump in?

455
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:46,579
It's like, no, not really.

456
01:00:46,579 --> 01:01:04,010
All right, well, dude, I played the punch out arcade machine

457
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,619
and I was so bad at it.

458
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:15,070
I was I told I told everybody, oh, you guys, I'm so good to punch out.

459
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,949
Punch out my game.

460
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:19,349
The arcade version is so hard.

461
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:23,010
It's so much harder.

462
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:28,929
I just look like a total dickhead because I see the punch out arcade machine.

463
01:01:28,929 --> 01:01:29,889
I'm going, that's awesome.

464
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:32,690
I punch out for NES, punch out for Super Nintendo, punch out for the Wii.

465
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,010
These are my games. I love them.

466
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:38,530
I could right now open up the Super Nintendo punch out

467
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:42,849
and not get hit one time, at least through all the three major circuits.

468
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:45,090
I could do it right now.

469
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:45,889
You know how I know that?

470
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:48,289
Because I did it like four days ago on the couch.

471
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,349
Do it right now.

472
01:01:51,349 --> 01:02:01,510
That's not. No, I just know I can prove it.

473
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,050
Maybe I'll prove it next time I stream.

474
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,929
Maybe not. OK, maybe not.

475
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:08,449
No damage, but I won't I won't be knocked down once.

476
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,869
In the first three, like beating the regular game.

477
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,610
The special circuit is very hard.

478
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,469
That's a lot less impressive.

479
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:36,539
All right. So let me let me let me bait you guys with like a really awesome

480
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:38,800
potential gamer thing.

481
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,840
Get everybody excited and then change the rules right before it happens

482
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,639
to something that's moderately, slightly, intermediately impressive.

483
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:53,300
I'll take it. All right.

484
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,440
Am I missing anything that I didn't play?

485
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,760
Because it's time to go to dizzy, dizzy bird.

486
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:02,550
This game sucks. I hate this one.

487
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,070
In the regular arcade, I hate it, too.

488
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,519
Well, what is anything else in the mall?

489
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:16,380
This is all new content.

490
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,780
Candy. Can I actually use it?

491
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:36,119
Oh, you can. Oh, eat them.

492
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:48,349
Nice. Excuse me, sir.

493
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:49,429
What are you doing over there?

494
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:53,099
Fuck up. I'm making my own coin pusher.

495
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:22,780
Those are some stale jelly beans.

496
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:30,980
Gooey bears.

497
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:37,730
Gummy bears are not supposed to crunch.

498
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:44,519
Oh, here we go. Jawbreakers.

499
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,969
Oh, that hurts to hear.

500
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:49,340
That hurts to think about somebody doing that.

501
01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:00,130
I buy new shoes.

502
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:07,179
What do you got? I play.

503
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:11,469
I can't shoot into the hoop.

504
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:20,449
Yes, I can.

505
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:23,019
You ignored the spiral game.

506
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,579
Oh, you mean this one over here?

507
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:35,739
I did. You're right.

508
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:40,579
Oh, first try.

509
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:41,099
I just beat it.

510
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,139
I don't do I need to play it again?

511
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:54,000
Not really.

512
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,420
It's another one, right?

513
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,820
You know what? I want to I want to play mini golf.

514
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:05,099
Is there a good mini golf game?

515
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,489
No bells and whistles. No bullshit.

516
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:13,429
Just mini golf.

517
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:17,130
There's a few.

518
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:19,409
I just want to play a standard mini golf course.

519
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:30,460
Golf it. Golf with friends.

520
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,820
I feel like I'm thinking back in the Super Nintendo N64 days.

521
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:44,079
Scratch tickets.

522
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,880
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

523
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,300
All right. I have.

524
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,929
All right. We're going to get a few of these.

525
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:06,360
And then we're taking this to Dizzy Bird.

526
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:16,980
Did I just buy? Where are they?

527
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,900
I got scammed.

528
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:29,840
No, I didn't. Let's scratch these.

529
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,199
And then I'm going to play 40 games of Dizzy Bird.

530
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:43,500
All right. Here we go.

531
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,460
Reveal three symbols.

532
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:53,880
Match three to win the fish.

533
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,000
All right. If I get one more four, it's 25, which I don't want.

534
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:06,269
I got my money back. Whatever.

535
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:07,429
All right. OK.

536
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:09,150
Oh, give me another car.

537
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:14,159
No, don't give me one.

538
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:22,859
Stop before it's too late.

539
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,609
I don't have any money left, so it is too late.

540
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:29,890
I'll take my money back here.

541
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:36,579
Give me another four.

542
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,819
Oh, no.

543
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:55,960
There better not be a one right here.

544
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:02,090
Wait, anything else in the mall?

545
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,050
Islandville Cinema.

546
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,319
I wonder if you can watch movies eventually.

547
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,159
That'd be kind of fun.

548
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:14,579
Credit union.

549
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:16,970
Wasn't there a food court or something?

550
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,689
How much is this?

551
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:30,770
All right. Make my wish.

552
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,850
Aim ramp at Zolbot's mouth.

553
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,630
Press red button to drop coin.

554
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:42,279
I got it.

555
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:48,359
Oh, is this? Did I win?

556
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:57,779
Wait, what did I just do?

557
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:58,539
What did you wish for?

558
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:06,850
I don't know. Nothing.

559
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,380
OK, I'll get it right this time.

560
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,100
All right. Here's my wish.

561
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:31,689
I have to hold it while I make my wish.

562
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:33,930
What does it say in the back?

563
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,770
Your wish is granted to.

564
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,729
Oh, nice.

565
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:55,739
I got a pirate pizza.

566
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:02,989
Just give me that one.

567
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:04,609
Let me make it. I'll do it.

568
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:12,609
Get out of the way.

569
01:11:12,609 --> 01:11:13,409
How do I buy a pizza?

570
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:14,590
I want to buy one.

571
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:27,449
Oh, here we go. Seven bucks.

572
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,250
Didn't I sit here a few years ago and buy like 100 of these?

573
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:49,159
Is it done?

574
01:11:49,159 --> 01:12:03,310
I just dumped that on myself.

575
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:07,279
Eat an entire pizza.

576
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:08,119
Ooh, tuna.

577
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:09,479
Ooh, tuna sandwich.

578
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:10,640
That sounds great.

579
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,840
Oh, man, that sounds amazing right now.

580
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:18,829
All right. Let's see.

581
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:22,909
I want a tuna sandwich.

582
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:25,859
And I want relish on it.

583
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:41,050
I want going to cook these like little plastic thing.

584
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:46,699
Look at that milk.

585
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:50,810
Oh, there it is.

586
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:57,310
I'm very satisfied.

587
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:01,460
Lemonista 450.

588
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:09,060
That sounds great.

589
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:21,979
Fresh squeezed lemonade.

590
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:27,050
That might be one of the best drinks.

591
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:30,130
Like when I think of a treat beverage, I think of fresh squeezed lemonade.

592
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:46,359
For sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

593
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:48,079
Now you can't play Dizzy Bird.

594
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,380
Yes, I can.

595
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:54,470
Yeah. Watch this. I get it.

596
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,329
All right. So I think that's all the mall.

597
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:58,569
Did I miss any stores?

598
01:13:58,569 --> 01:13:59,649
We went to the jewelry store.

599
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:09,369
Wait, what's this? Nothing.

600
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:10,789
Spunkies.

601
01:14:10,789 --> 01:14:12,149
Whoa, this.

602
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:16,010
All right. This is cool.

603
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:23,109
Spunkies.

604
01:14:23,109 --> 01:14:30,319
Yep. Oh, yeah.

605
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:33,220
Hoverboards.

606
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,619
I have one of these.

607
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:37,510
I have two of these in real life.

608
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,479
Not the back.

609
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:48,720
Go to the back.

610
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:58,390
Not the back.

611
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:06,199
Light sword.

612
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:08,899
OK, you want to know what's crazy?

613
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:13,380
Think about this from here to here.

614
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,420
You are in a different store at Spunkies.

615
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:20,010
Do you know what I'm saying?

616
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,689
Like, it's crazy that it's just like, oh, yeah, come on in.

617
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:24,689
Look at all. There's like.

618
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:28,699
Oh, Luke Skywalker.

619
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:32,140
Oh, my God. Oh, look, there's a gorilla's T-shirt.

620
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,770
Oh, where is it?

621
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:37,220
This is a completely different store now.

622
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,659
This is a different store.

623
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,550
And I don't know if I should be in here.

624
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,380
Don't forget the mushroom posters.

625
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,819
That's right.

626
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:02,260
And there was always right here, right here, right here on a rack right here.

627
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,659
It would be right in front of me.

628
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,619
There'd be a book where a fart is coming out of some guy's ass.

629
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,699
It's just a little book.

630
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:13,180
And it's like, oh, there's like a smoke fart coming out of a guy's ass.

631
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,819
I don't even know what the product is.

632
01:16:15,819 --> 01:16:17,020
I just know that it's here.

633
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:41,380
It's literally right here on capacitor, right next to the edible underwear.

634
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:51,039
Yep. And if you're wondering, this is definitely where.

635
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:54,930
Do you remember? This is like four years ago when I didn't I get in a fight

636
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:59,569
with everybody here saying that there was a product where like you put the coin in

637
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:01,609
and like the guy like shits his pants or something.

638
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:03,090
Somebody like farts.

639
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,819
It's like a toy.

640
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,340
And people were like, that's not real.

641
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,500
And I was like, yes, it is.

642
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,100
You put a coin. It's like a little bank.

643
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,539
You put a coin in and it's like

644
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,109
the guy like farts.

645
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:18,800
It's a real product.

646
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,119
And everybody told me, no way, dude, you're out of your mind.

647
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:22,199
And then people were like, no, it's real.

648
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:30,140
Actually, it is real.

649
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:33,750
This was such a weird store.

650
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,630
Yeah. And also make sure you go right here to grab.

651
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:42,189
They were always in the front of the store posters for movies

652
01:17:42,189 --> 01:17:44,149
that have not been relevant in 10 years.

653
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:49,109
Well, I swear there's like an Indiana Jones two poster in here

654
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:59,260
and it's from 1990 old bands that broke up five years ago.

655
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:04,270
We're in here.

656
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:06,310
Yeah. Adam Sandler's click is in here.

657
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:09,010
Exactly. That's correct.

658
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,409
Hot tub time machine.

659
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:17,949
Yep. This step brothers posters in here.

660
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:28,630
What a wild store.

661
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:33,090
What a fucking crazy place that really is.

662
01:18:33,289 --> 01:18:45,140
Spencer's like I can't imagine like being the person

663
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,640
that was responsible for like, oh, what's going to be in the store?

664
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,279
All right. Yeah.

665
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:51,000
Well, we're going to have Finding Nemo.

666
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,430
Stickers have to be over here.

667
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,829
And then, yeah, just fill up the back with all, you know,

668
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,600
the thing you put your hand on for the electricity.

669
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,560
But also we have to have the edible underwear,

670
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,680
some of the other fucking pornographic material.

671
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:13,720
Yeah, I think what's that book?

672
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:16,560
What's that book about all the sex positions?

673
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,220
What's it called?

674
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,630
Yeah, I want that over here.

675
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,630
Put that like 10 feet to the left of the of the silly string.

676
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,699
It was a wild place.

677
01:19:44,369 --> 01:19:45,930
They had the boobie mugs, too.

678
01:19:45,930 --> 01:20:00,220
Don't forget that. Yeah.

679
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,729
Yeah. What what an interesting thought.

680
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:06,810
No other store I can think of you could leave

681
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:10,380
with the funny science experiment.

682
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,350
Put your hand on the globe and a sex position book

683
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:28,829
in the same checkout counter.

684
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:32,890
They definitely had a thing of fake poop.

685
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,659
I'm sure they did.

686
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:47,020
Actually, I think I know what you mean. Yeah.

687
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:53,970
Wow. Memories.

688
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:54,609
Did I see all the mall?

689
01:20:54,609 --> 01:21:06,199
Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

690
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:07,479
How much longer are you going to be streaming for?

691
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:09,859
Um, probably not much longer.

692
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:12,970
I'm going to do Dizzy Bird and probably call it there.

693
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,949
Wait, I want to do this.

694
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:17,409
Oh, I need a dollar to do the thing.

695
01:21:17,409 --> 01:21:22,810
I know where to get money.

696
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,470
No, no, no. Wrong.

697
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,350
I thought that was the arcade. Wrong.

698
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,819
How much longer do you think you're going to be alive?

699
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:39,810
I'm making it to 100.

700
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:40,649
I'm going to make it to 100.

701
01:21:40,649 --> 01:21:41,369
They're going to interview me.

702
01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:45,579
I'm going to have like garlic around my neck

703
01:21:45,579 --> 01:21:49,380
and like vials of manuka honey that I swear by.

704
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,970
Where's the money thing?

705
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:22,930
Where is it?

706
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,300
100. No, I don't.

707
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,260
I don't know if I would.

708
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:34,060
I don't know if I'd want to be 100.

709
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:38,380
I think 100 is I think that's it's I don't know if I want to be honored

710
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:43,500
at 100. I'm not even sure.

711
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,909
I'm trying to think of how my body would be functioning at 100

712
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,109
because I know how it functions now, right now.

713
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:00,850
I feel like at 100, if I accidentally close my finger in a car door,

714
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,569
my whole body is going to explode into dust.

715
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,510
I just won't exist anymore.

716
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:11,640
It'll just be like, ah, just completely gone.

717
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,279
That's when you get I don't know when you get to be 100.

718
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:22,159
It's like that's remarkable.

719
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,119
That's unbelievable.

720
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:27,399
But that's when I start to see the person talking

721
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:33,439
and their teeth come out like that's what happens when you get to be 100.

722
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:36,260
I don't know if I want to do that.

723
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:36,859
I'm not sure.

724
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:39,579
I don't really want to experience that at any point.

725
01:23:40,859 --> 01:23:43,100
I don't want to be mid-sentence and be like,

726
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:47,529
let me just ruin my teeth around and the teeth are just gone out.

727
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,180
I don't know if I don't know if I want that.

728
01:23:50,180 --> 01:24:04,420
I don't know if I want to do that.

729
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:10,489
Don't buy shit teeth then.

730
01:24:10,489 --> 01:24:17,520
That sounds like something you would actually love doing.

731
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,880
Actually, like, like, I don't know.

732
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,189
I think that is actually kind of funny.

733
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:22,750
All right.

734
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,880
Now, what do you everybody stop?

735
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,569
The next time that I am able to present, I'm presenting something.

736
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,750
I'm going to have fake teeth and and I'm going to they're going to

737
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:42,479
oh, they're going to come out.

738
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:51,359
OK, isn't Dizzy Bird's here somewhere?

739
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:53,460
Isn't Dizzy Bird here?

740
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,800
Dizzy Bird's in a few places.

741
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:13,109
Wait, I want to play this guy.

742
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:18,479
This guy's shit faced.

743
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:27,090
That's like a crayon.

744
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,649
We've done this before a few times.

745
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:31,289
Oh, it's in the regular arcade.

746
01:25:31,449 --> 01:25:45,149
Just Larry's, right?

747
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:47,220
It's some carnival food.

748
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:52,380
Carnival food is so great.

749
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,449
What is the best food at a carnival?

750
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,340
Fried dough. That's easy.

751
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,819
Wait, that's not true.

752
01:26:01,819 --> 01:26:04,359
No, that's not true.

753
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,640
Oh, I'm really late to this.

754
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,279
Sorry, everybody.

755
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:12,399
It's nine o'clock at night.

756
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,529
Oh, it's the it's the hot Italian sausages.

757
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:21,010
You know, the one, you know, you know, the kiosk.

758
01:26:21,819 --> 01:26:25,439
It's that one.

759
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:26,880
I remember when I was.

760
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,039
Oh, man, this is such a long time ago.

761
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:32,100
I'm not making it up.

762
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,420
I ate I think I ate four of those in a row.

763
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:38,819
I had to have been like under.

764
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:42,479
I was probably like twenty nineteen maybe.

765
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:47,050
I ate four of those hot Italian sausages and it was such a bad.

766
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:47,729
It was awful.

767
01:26:47,729 --> 01:26:48,409
And I knew it was.

768
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:49,210
But I was like, I have to.

769
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,810
This is only how many times do you come to like the carnival?

770
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:01,250
Not at once.

771
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:06,420
It was in a it was it was over the course of it was probably

772
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,380
over the course of a couple of hours, actually.

773
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:11,899
But it was in a row.

774
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:15,060
Guys, I'm also that person that makes sure there is a dole

775
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:20,000
whip in my hand for at least two thirds of the time I'm walking around Disneyland.

776
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,859
So I love my carnival food.

777
01:27:24,859 --> 01:27:39,619
I love my theme park food.

778
01:27:39,619 --> 01:27:41,500
Cotton candy is all right.

779
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,739
I think cotton candy.

780
01:27:45,739 --> 01:27:50,420
I'm I kind of like taking a piece of somebody else's cotton candy, but a whole one.

781
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:55,399
I feel the same way about movie popcorn.

782
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:58,619
The way I do about cotton candy.

783
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:01,260
I'll take a handful from somebody else's popcorn,

784
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,109
but I don't want to buy a popcorn.

785
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:05,069
I don't want to buy my own cotton candy.

786
01:28:05,069 --> 01:28:07,270
I'll have a piece of yours if you'll give it to me.

787
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,569
What about funnel cake?

788
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,649
Fried dough is funnel cake, right?

789
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:18,859
Or no, it's a wait. It's different.

790
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:21,439
Funnel cake is the one that it's kind of stringy.

791
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,859
Fried dough is in one piece.

792
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:28,489
That's right.

793
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:30,489
I think funnel cake is better than fried dough,

794
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:37,029
with one very, very important exception.

795
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:39,970
One piece.

796
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:43,510
What do you mean? It's in one.

797
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:45,729
Yeah. All right.

798
01:28:45,729 --> 01:28:48,609
OK, fried dough is funnel cake, but it's one big.

799
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,289
It's like a big piece of bread.

800
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:55,409
It's like a giant loaf of bread.

801
01:28:55,409 --> 01:28:58,369
Funnel cake is sort of stringy and swirly, right?

802
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,739
There's one part of a piece of fried dough,

803
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:12,380
the very middle that has the pool of cinnamon and oil.

804
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:14,829
You get it. It's right to the middle.

805
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:17,109
It is soaked up cinnamon, sugar and oil in the middle.

806
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,319
And it's it's heaven.

807
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:29,920
It's heavenly.

808
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,479
And you fill it with sugar.

809
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:34,560
That see that chat member knows exactly what's going on.

810
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:41,460
Yes. You make a little a little island in the middle

811
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,060
with cinnamon and sugar.

812
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:54,229
I can't even see it. Where is it?

813
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:56,750
Chat member, aka loser.

814
01:29:57,909 --> 01:30:00,739
All right. Actually, time that person out.

815
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:01,699
All right. Time that person out.

816
01:30:01,699 --> 01:30:09,850
Actually, that person should get a time out.

817
01:30:17,729 --> 01:30:19,680
Wait, hold on.

818
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,649
Aren't you here, too?

819
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:27,289
You can't say chat member, aka fucking loser.

820
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:30,779
But you're in the chat.

821
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:32,550
Come on, man.

822
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:34,430
We're just hanging out here together.

823
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:45,260
We're just chilling.

824
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,779
It was in quotes, too.

825
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:48,140
That's what that was.

826
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,739
Fucking so funny.

827
01:30:50,739 --> 01:31:07,569
Chat member was in quotes.

828
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:09,250
Hey, is this Baldur's Gate waiting room?

829
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,239
I don't know. You're going to play it.

830
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,800
What if you want to play?

831
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:30,140
Go for it.

832
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:31,939
Have you seen one piece on Netflix?

833
01:31:31,939 --> 01:31:35,180
No, I have not.

834
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:38,350
And I'm sorry, guys.

835
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:43,779
I I don't have it in me to watch a thousand episodes of television.

836
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,449
I don't have it in me.

837
01:31:46,449 --> 01:31:57,720
I just don't have it in me.

838
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,720
Can you imagine if the live action version was going to have the same

839
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,199
amount of episodes as the anime?

840
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:07,859
I hope those actors are ready to sign on for the next 30 years.

841
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:11,840
So it's going to take 30 seasons in a row.

842
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:22,340
It'll take so long.

843
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:24,420
It'll take like 70 years to get there.

844
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:29,520
They'll have to recast the actors five or six different times.

845
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:38,119
Soap opera one piece.

846
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:45,770
Yeah, that's it right there. I got it.

847
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,890
I have heard that the Netflix show is good, though.

848
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:50,369
I've heard, hey, actually, it's pretty good.

849
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:01,880
Who said that?

850
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,840
Oh, boy. What did I do?

851
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:09,659
Oh, boy. Oh, I shouldn't have said anything.

852
01:33:10,449 --> 01:33:21,720
Oh, boy. That's it.

853
01:33:24,979 --> 01:33:32,659
If you're a fan, it's OK.

854
01:33:32,659 --> 01:33:35,300
I just don't know.

855
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,189
I don't I don't know if I'll watch it.

856
01:33:38,189 --> 01:33:43,000
Not because I don't care about one piece, but I don't know.

857
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,819
I just what's a TV show that I really want to watch?

858
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:59,819
It's not one piece.

859
01:33:59,819 --> 01:34:02,939
Bro, it's good. It's good.

860
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:05,500
People are saying Mob Psycho.

861
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:10,460
You know what?

862
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:13,810
I will watch Mob Psycho before I'm 40.

863
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,479
OK, I will watch Mob Psycho

864
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:21,590
and the Smurfs movie at the same time on different monitors.

865
01:34:36,739 --> 01:34:38,220
Please watch. Oh, that's right.

866
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,960
I do have to watch.

867
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,039
I got a few movies to watch.

868
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:45,289
What's the best mini food like mini pizza, mini bagels?

869
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:57,140
That's mini food.

870
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:03,750
Um, do donut holes count?

871
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:16,329
That could be it.

872
01:35:16,329 --> 01:35:19,310
Those are probably up there.

873
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:23,510
Powder donut donut holes or glazed donut donut holes.

874
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:30,470
Barry's a very good show.

875
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:33,670
I've seen the first season of Barry.

876
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:35,789
I just didn't ever turn it back on.

877
01:35:35,789 --> 01:35:39,510
Kind of like what I did with Critical Soul, which I don't know why.

878
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:51,590
I really liked it.

879
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,670
All right. How many is this?

880
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,869
Did I do it 40 times?

881
01:35:53,869 --> 01:36:01,260
Because it's time to go.

882
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,489
Oh, man.

883
01:36:03,489 --> 01:36:09,109
I said 40, right?

884
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:11,390
This one, this is the easiest one to get.

885
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:15,550
It's like right here.

886
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:27,390
Oh, so close.

887
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:31,409
That's not going to make it.

888
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:35,630
Play till you win.

889
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,350
Ah, all right.

890
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:37,590
This is the one right now.

891
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:43,460
Here we go. Got it.

892
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,460
I mean, I got it. I got it.

893
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,140
I'm good. I beat it.

894
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:50,909
I beat it. All right.

895
01:36:50,909 --> 01:36:52,029
Now, holy shit.

896
01:36:52,029 --> 01:36:57,100
There's a lot of tickets here.

897
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:01,079
Go two in a row.

898
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:02,800
Oh, almost two in a row.

899
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:17,739
That was pretty good.

900
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:18,659
This is a cozy game.

901
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:21,859
I love this game.

902
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:51,859
Is there anything else I want to play last second before I'm done?

903
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:59,380
Damn, this one's a scam.

904
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,500
Yeah. What do they say?

905
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,680
If any of these have like Nintendo switches in them,

906
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:09,649
it's like your odds of winning are like incredibly horrible, right?

907
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:14,119
You're looking for the ones that have like the five dollar gift cards in them

908
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:17,220
because those ones typically are much easier to hit.

909
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,340
They are impossible.

910
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,539
Just buy a Nintendo switch at GameStop.

911
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,340
I've met people that have won these.

912
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,979
They're definitely possible.

913
01:38:42,979 --> 01:38:46,090
Otherwise, nobody would play them.

914
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:48,729
But it's got to get really lucky that you get in there

915
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:52,489
when the machine is like, yep, it's time for you to for someone to win.

916
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,829
Although this one might be only skilled.

917
01:38:59,149 --> 01:39:09,060
I don't know. I'm not sure how this one works.

918
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,619
I got stuck in one of these once.

919
01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:17,909
What? I read that really like that was a very normal occurrence.

920
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,739
Apparently you got stuck.

921
01:39:20,739 --> 01:39:22,300
All right. Well, I hope you're right.

922
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,890
I want to ask how, but I kind of don't.

923
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:34,029
I don't think I even need we don't even need the story.

924
01:39:34,029 --> 01:39:39,750
Yeah, we don't need the story.

925
01:39:39,789 --> 01:40:01,800
Oh, a glow stick.

926
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:17,380
I give my shit.

927
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:18,539
Yeah, I read it and weep.

928
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:21,420
Look at that. I got the ticket.

929
01:40:33,529 --> 01:40:40,159
And I get a slingshot.

930
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,560
All right. Last game is it?

931
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,760
And then I'm going to call the stream.

932
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:45,079
I'm going to make sure I get another major prize. Let's go.

933
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,760
Thanks for watching, everybody.

934
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:57,079
This has been Sunday.

935
01:40:57,079 --> 01:41:02,000
Hope you're having a good weekend.

936
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,149
I got a dragon armor correspond.

937
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:09,220
This is also fun.

938
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,300
I don't know what my plan is next week.

939
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,760
I would just keep an eye on the sauce.

940
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,560
Probably another later in the week stream.

941
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:18,310
I might I probably will do two streams at the end of the week.

942
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:32,189
We might double it up.

943
01:41:32,189 --> 01:41:36,890
Maybe play Armored Core on one of those and go from there.

944
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:59,380
All right. I got to focus.

945
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:11,060
Go for it.

946
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:23,579
Yeah, I don't have enough coins.

947
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,600
Can I sell anything?

948
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,199
Can I see anybody?

949
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,600
Anyone want to buy a pair of headphones?

950
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,960
I'm never going to that piece of shit ever again.

951
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,979
All that place does is take your fucking money.

952
01:43:00,979 --> 01:43:02,220
The slots don't even pay out.

953
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,380
Don't even go in there.

954
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:17,189
It's not even worth it.

955
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:19,050
I'll see you guys later.

956
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:19,649
Thanks for watching.

957
01:43:19,649 --> 01:43:23,060
See you guys next week.

958
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:25,800
Probably like Saturday, Saturday, Sunday.

959
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:29,119
I'm liking the weekend stuff.

960
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:36,649
Weekend streams, I weekends are pretty open and it's nice, too.

961
01:43:36,649 --> 01:43:39,500
It's nice to kind of wind down on the weekend and just play and hang out.

962
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:46,210
I like it a lot.

963
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,850
Expect more like Saturday, Sunday, sometimes Saturday, Sunday, both.

964
01:43:50,289 --> 01:43:52,729
Sometimes maybe just one.

965
01:43:52,729 --> 01:43:55,329
But I'm imagining next weekend I'll probably want to play

966
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:00,569
pretty a little bit further into Armored Core six than I already did.

967
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:02,710
That just scared the fuck out of me.

968
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,590
What just happened?

969
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:09,149
Oh, right.

970
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:09,789
Hope you had a good time.

971
01:44:09,789 --> 01:44:11,050
I had a good time.

972
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:15,489
I'm glad that I got through the water filter release partially.

973
01:44:19,569 --> 01:44:20,250
Take care of yourselves.

974
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,579
Have a good rest of your weekend.

975
01:44:21,579 --> 01:44:24,579
I know it's pretty much over, but see you next week.

976
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:26,619
Probably Saturday or Sunday or maybe both.

977
01:44:26,979 --> 01:44:33,869
I would say at least Saturday.

978
01:44:33,869 --> 01:44:37,229
Take care of yourselves and call your mother.

979
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:42,579
What about Darken Darker?

980
01:44:42,579 --> 01:44:45,579
I'm going to do some serious looking into Darken Darker

981
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:48,020
because I keep getting the urge to play it.

982
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:55,069
I just want to play it.

983
01:44:55,069 --> 01:44:56,670
Yeah, you keep the sus pretty vague.

984
01:44:56,670 --> 01:45:04,180
Just say this coming weekend.

985
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,579
I also want to play browser games.

986
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:06,140
I just want to do.

987
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,979
Yeah, we'll do two streams this coming weekend.

988
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:09,800
That makes sense to me.

989
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,840
At the very least, we'll do it.

990
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,840
We'll just put the sus for Saturday.

991
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:17,920
Maybe. Hmm.

992
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,510
Just say at the end of the week, pick one.

993
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:26,350
I want to make sure I'm not thinking, overthinking this.

994
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:29,090
They might have something going on on Saturday.

995
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:36,819
But let's see.

996
01:45:36,819 --> 01:45:48,100
What did I just click on?

997
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,109
Yeah, definitely at the end of the week, though.

998
01:45:52,109 --> 01:45:57,619
See you guys later. See you soon.

999
01:45:57,619 --> 01:46:00,500
Actually working on a lot of really, really fun stuff for Offbrand.

1000
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:07,020
I'm imagining that very soon here, be able to kind of maybe share

1001
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:13,350
some of that stuff, because I've been kind of supplementally involved

1002
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:18,380
in a lot of Offbrand's stuff that you've seen, but not really like in it,

1003
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:22,050
in it like I'm going, I'm going for it.

1004
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:24,390
Because when I joined the company,

1005
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:28,529
you know, obviously there was stuff that there was going on

1006
01:46:28,529 --> 01:46:32,300
that I wasn't really on yet.

1007
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,420
But supplementally, you've seen a couple of shows

1008
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:38,140
that I had some stuff to do with, but not really.

1009
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:43,659
The stuff I'm working on now, that is I'm very, very involved in.

1010
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:44,979
So I'm looking forward to it.

1011
01:46:44,979 --> 01:46:57,470
Let's see how it plays out.

1012
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:59,109
What's my game of the year for 2023?

1013
01:46:59,109 --> 01:47:03,199
Well, 2023 isn't over.

1014
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:06,100
Pizza Tower, Resident Evil 4 Remake.

1015
01:47:09,579 --> 01:47:11,220
I've been I've been writing them down.

1016
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,380
My throat is so weird lately.

1017
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:25,220
I have been writing them down.

1018
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:30,939
I wrote Dark and Darker on here.

1019
01:47:30,939 --> 01:47:36,460
I think right now it's probably a Resident Evil 4 Remake or Pizza Tower.

1020
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,130
Although I haven't played Baldur's Gate 3.

1021
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:52,069
I know that's probably going to change my mind.

1022
01:47:52,069 --> 01:47:53,710
Although we'll see.

1023
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:57,550
I'm not a huge fan of top down,

1024
01:47:57,970 --> 01:48:02,539
more kind of turn based action adventure type games.

1025
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:07,579
But just what I've heard and seen or what you can do in Baldur's Gate 3

1026
01:48:07,579 --> 01:48:10,020
and how stuff happens in Baldur's Gate 3.

1027
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:12,189
What about Sorcery?

1028
01:48:12,189 --> 01:48:14,350
Sorcery was more of a book to me than a game.

1029
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:17,699
I read Sorcery.

1030
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:23,100
I don't really play Sorcery.

1031
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:27,529
I probably will like it.

1032
01:48:27,529 --> 01:48:34,439
It's a lot like Sorcery.

1033
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:36,239
Baldur's Gate 3 has actual porn in it.

1034
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:41,689
OK, whatever.

1035
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:46,649
How about Starfield?

1036
01:48:46,649 --> 01:48:49,710
Starfield is on Game Pass right now.

1037
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:52,819
And I have to I've got to tell you the truth, because all I can be.

1038
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:55,420
I want to be truthful.

1039
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,699
I opened up Starfield on Game Pass.

1040
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:02,449
I fell asleep within, I want to say, an hour.

1041
01:49:05,869 --> 01:49:10,899
Now, that does not necessarily mean I thought that Starfield wasn't a good game.

1042
01:49:10,899 --> 01:49:12,500
I may have been very tired.

1043
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:16,250
I was I was very sleepy.

1044
01:49:16,409 --> 01:49:24,149
It put him to sleep.

1045
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:26,939
It wasn't a bad experience.

1046
01:49:26,939 --> 01:49:27,260
All right.

1047
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:33,029
I got to the point when, OK, you you get off the ship,

1048
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,119
you touch that thing and I don't want to spoil anything.

1049
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:46,220
But like you get off the ship, the guy says,

1050
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:49,210
Oh, hey, you must be new here.

1051
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:52,369
Hey, you can sell items over there on the right at that kiosk.

1052
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:55,020
Welcome to the city.

1053
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,779
That's the first 10 minutes, dude.

1054
01:49:59,779 --> 01:50:03,750
That's New Atlantis. Yeah.

1055
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:05,390
And then I don't OK.

1056
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,539
Listen to me.

1057
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:12,579
I like accidentally attacked somebody and I had to I had to redo a whole save file

1058
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:14,939
because I accidentally hit somebody in the face with something.

1059
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:18,210
And then the whole city starts fucking attacking me.

1060
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:25,960
And even after dying, they still come after you.

1061
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,789
And I remember Holly was sitting right next to me on the couch.

1062
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:34,180
I'm like, what do I do if I like attack somebody in a city

1063
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:36,300
and the whole city is attacking me now?

1064
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,220
And when I die, they all still attack me.

1065
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:48,260
What do I do?

1066
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:54,779
You have to save scum.

1067
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:56,100
Oh, no, the actions of my own cons.

1068
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:00,260
Put away your weapon and let the cops take you.

1069
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:09,510
Maybe you should think harder about your violence.

1070
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:13,500
You can leave the city for 24 hours to calm most people down,

1071
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:26,579
but you'll still have a bounty.

1072
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:29,899
I feel like streaming Starfield would be really fun,

1073
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:32,619
but unbearable for everybody.

1074
01:51:34,539 --> 01:51:35,979
I just won't ever get anything done.

1075
01:51:35,979 --> 01:51:41,340
I'll just be throwing rocks at people and get arrested and stuff in the game.

1076
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:48,199
And I'll just never get anything done.

1077
01:51:48,199 --> 01:51:50,800
People would be so pissed at the way that I would play that game.

1078
01:51:52,619 --> 01:52:00,310
I'm also, by the way, I'll tell you, just walking around in Bethesda games

1079
01:52:00,869 --> 01:52:07,060
and just picking up all the cups and newspapers and paperclips on every table.

1080
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,460
I'm sick of doing that.

1081
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:18,069
I don't I don't want to do that anymore.

1082
01:52:18,069 --> 01:52:22,020
And then you can't you can't move.

1083
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,020
And I know it's like, don't then don't do it. Impossible.

1084
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:28,789
When there's so many things highlighted in the room,

1085
01:52:28,989 --> 01:52:36,659
I'm going to pick up some of them in Skyrim and Oblivion.

1086
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,220
Dude, I would just walk into the weapons merchant place

1087
01:52:39,659 --> 01:52:41,739
and just take every single thing from the counter

1088
01:52:41,739 --> 01:52:43,460
and just never come back to that town ever again.

1089
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:56,539
I can't play these games.

1090
01:52:56,539 --> 01:53:02,779
Hoarder. It's the same thing in Baldur's Gate three.

1091
01:53:02,779 --> 01:53:07,439
Oh, no, you're too evil to play them.

1092
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:12,069
Now, I play the game as a good character.

1093
01:53:12,069 --> 01:53:17,029
Anytime you guys see me play games like RPGs, I try to make good decisions,

1094
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:25,010
but I do bad things like I will just throw the rock at the fucking wall.

1095
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,630
I will just punch the guy in the face.

1096
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:31,840
But I'm going to divert the laser from hitting Earth.

1097
01:53:32,199 --> 01:53:38,060
Do you know I'm saying I will go in the back and take every single item

1098
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,460
from the armor merchant,

1099
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:43,699
and then I'm going to go help the old lady walk across the street outside.

1100
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,899
What is that chaotic good?

1101
01:53:48,899 --> 01:53:58,359
I don't know. Is it that's chaotic neutral?

1102
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:03,569
I don't know.

1103
01:54:03,569 --> 01:54:08,720
Ball of yarn with a knife.

1104
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,899
Oh, the Joker. That's right.

1105
01:54:10,899 --> 01:54:14,739
It's called balancing karma.

1106
01:54:14,739 --> 01:54:20,399
I usually do the good storyline, but in the good storyline,

1107
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:26,170
I don't roundhouse kick somebody in the head at some point.

1108
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:37,180
Chaotic. Good. That's chaotic.

1109
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:45,069
Neutral. Dear God, dot, dot, dot.

1110
01:54:50,029 --> 01:54:51,189
Sometimes you just got to do it.

1111
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:52,829
Sometimes you just have to roundhouse kick somebody.

1112
01:54:52,829 --> 01:54:57,970
Yeah. Chaotic. Stupid.

1113
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:00,050
Please play Breath of the Wild again.

1114
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:03,920
All right. OK, OK, OK.

1115
01:55:05,319 --> 01:55:07,880
Oh, here's what's going to happen.

1116
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:10,869
You you guys have to be good, though.

1117
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:13,149
You have to be good on.

1118
01:55:13,149 --> 01:55:19,149
You have to be good because I haven't played Breath of the Wild months.

1119
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:21,789
So I it's I'm going to be like the control.

1120
01:55:21,829 --> 01:55:23,949
Oh, yeah, I can't believe you have to press X to jump.

1121
01:55:23,949 --> 01:55:25,470
But I have to press Y to jump.

1122
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:26,829
This game's stupid.

1123
01:55:26,829 --> 01:55:28,789
Just just bear with my bullshit for a little bit.

1124
01:55:29,779 --> 01:55:32,340
Just just be like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's stupid.

1125
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

1126
01:55:33,539 --> 01:55:41,760
Just play it and I'll play it this weekend.

1127
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,479
What do you want to play?

1128
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:46,920
I want to finish it.

1129
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:50,939
I can't just not that I this one guardian left and Ganon.

1130
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:51,699
That's it.

1131
01:55:51,699 --> 01:55:55,289
I'm almost at the end of the game.

1132
01:55:55,289 --> 01:55:56,569
I have to beat Breath of the Wild.

1133
01:55:56,569 --> 01:55:57,770
I have to at least complete that game.

1134
01:55:57,770 --> 01:55:59,810
I can't just let it sit there at two thirds completion.

1135
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,380
There's no I can't do that.

1136
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:16,319
Not going to happen.

1137
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:17,319
Final Fantasy 16.

1138
01:56:17,319 --> 01:56:23,680
I actually played Final Fantasy 16 yesterday, so I have played it.

1139
01:56:24,579 --> 01:56:26,770
I really do like it.

1140
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:30,449
I have a feeling, depending on how I feel about that game

1141
01:56:32,289 --> 01:56:38,289
in a few months, if I actually get to the end, that could be up there pretty high.

1142
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:51,439
I might just turn that on, too, and just stream it.

1143
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:52,979
All right. So here's the deal.

1144
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:55,899
We're going to play Breath of the Wild, Armored Core six,

1145
01:56:57,140 --> 01:57:06,680
and maybe a little bit of I'm not going to play Final Fantasy 16 this weekend.

1146
01:57:10,859 --> 01:57:13,380
I want like an open your mouth and just sit there game.

1147
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:18,119
You know, I mean, Armored Core six is intense.

1148
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,779
Breath of the Wild is intense.

1149
01:57:20,779 --> 01:57:23,579
I want to I want just to open my mouth, just mouth open,

1150
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:27,810
just eyes completely glazed over, just punch out.

1151
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:31,909
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

1152
01:57:31,909 --> 01:57:34,069
Hey, that's a good idea. Yeah. All right.

1153
01:57:34,069 --> 01:57:35,699
All right. That's the plan.

1154
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:37,699
The plan for this weekend is we're going to do Breath of the Wild

1155
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:44,510
super punch out, not getting hit once.

1156
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:48,489
Well, not getting downed once.

1157
01:57:48,489 --> 01:57:50,300
And then maybe some Armored Core.

1158
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:57,979
I think that's a good plan this coming weekend.

1159
01:57:57,979 --> 01:58:04,300
And also, I'm going to try to beat Breath of the Wild this weekend.

1160
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:10,340
So wherever we are in the game, I'm going to try to finish it up.

1161
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,220
We will see the end.

1162
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:28,939
Sure, sure, sure, surely, surely.

1163
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:35,329
I'll see you guys later.

1164
01:58:35,329 --> 01:58:37,100
Take care of yourself. Thanks for watching.

1165
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:40,600
And we'll we'll figure it out this weekend.

1166
01:58:41,989 --> 01:58:48,000
We'll get it all figured out this weekend.

1167
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,479
I think that's a fairly good plan.

1168
01:58:53,149 --> 01:58:54,430
Good night. Goodbye.

1169
01:58:54,430 --> 01:59:00,340
Take care of yourselves. See you soon. Bye bye.
