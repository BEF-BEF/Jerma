1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:13,240
23 hours and 55 minutes early for tomorrow's stream because this one didn't turn on before

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,089
two. I see what you're saying. So this is actually tomorrow's stream. I didn't stream today. This is

3
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:34,600
tomorrow's stream. Anyways, uh, hello. How are you? Welcome back. I'm going to be playing some sniper

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,219
ghost warrior contracts today. I saw it pop up on steam and I'm like, you know what?

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm, I want, we played the last sniper game. We played the last two sniper games, the last two

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,840
sniper elite and then sniper go. I think pretty sure we played both of them when they came out.

7
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,549
So there is a backup plan. If, uh, if I don't think this is fun, if I'm just like, nah, I don't think

8
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:10,890
so. Uh, I got dusk, which is just everybody, everybody loves that game. I've never played

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,530
it personally, but, and we could also, there's a bit, we got like a bunch of other like mystery

10
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,219
games we could play. So who cares? I probably shouldn't even said dusk because now everyone's

11
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,060
far going to be like, just, just do that instead. Just play dusk instead. But no,

12
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,340
I am a AAA video gamer right now. I want to play the new AAA video games and the new AAA

13
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,890
game that came out yesterday was sniper ghost warrior contracts too. It's not a AAA game.

14
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,530
I know, but give me a second. Uh, I'm going to get it over on the screen here and we'll get started.

15
00:01:45,530 --> 00:02:25,000
Give me one sec. All right. Let's chill for a second here. I've got to warn you.

16
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:39,900
You're about to get your eyes blown out. So just be ready. Ready? One, two, three. It's bright as

17
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:50,020
hell. It's very bright. I don't know why this screen is this bright, but it is. So in sniper

18
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,469
ghost warrior contracts, it's your job as the hit man to, I have no idea.

19
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:09,340
I didn't even, guys, I did not even read the description of this game. Greetings,

20
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,590
mercenary. I represent a third party who wishes to make use of your specialist skills.

21
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,319
Nice. We are aware of your usual fees and are comfortable meeting the cost.

22
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,000
In fact, you've seen my last place for you to execute.

23
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,550
All are in the newly formed Siberian Republic. Skip, skip. No, I'm not skipping. This gets on

24
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,669
screen. Siberia was once part of the Russian Federation. Was it? Whoa. Siberia's huge natural

25
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,830
resources to bolster Russian economic success. Russia had a shitload of gold, but Siberia was

26
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,629
that sand from this relationship. In fact, it was mainly exploited and used

27
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:57,560
a political movement was established. The people for an independent Siberia,

28
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,770
even the regional governor, Mergui, Kurchatov was swept up in the wave,

29
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:11,210
joining the movement and cutting off Siberia from the Kremlin. The Siberian war of independence

30
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:18,730
followed Russia contained many Siberians and defections were right. The war was over quickly.

31
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,050
Kurchatov became Siberia's first prime minister, governing his new country with his family and

32
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,170
friends. Dude, it even has, okay. Just read the subtitles for a second. It even has the like,

33
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,490
spreading out the hitman shit, like the little wire frames and the white and the...

34
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,379
All right, let's keep our... Declared war against their government. They attacked oil fields and

35
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:52,420
stole state assets. Their leader, Nastya Tsurikova, has now become a hero to the people

36
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:59,699
and Kurchatov's nemesis. Our proposal comes with one requirement. You will need to wear a new

37
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,740
high-tech mask. You have to wear a Halloween mask. It will facilitate direct communication.

38
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,259
Nobody can tell who you are. But there are other benefits for you, including combat enhancements.

39
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:17,939
My designation will be handler. Yours will be seeker. I look forward to working with you.

40
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:28,100
I gotta wear an Andros mask? I think that thing's cold and... We're in Siberia, right?

41
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,019
That thing looked like it was made out of steel. You want me to wear a steel mask on my face

42
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:49,050
in like negative 12 degrees? That thing's not coming off. All right, here we go. Proving

43
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,279
grounds complete the tutorial. Let's take a look at the details so I know what I'm working with here.

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,540
All right, it's just a top-down view. Cool. Start the contract. Marksman. Game difficulty

45
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,139
has decreased. Enemies are less aware. They see and hear the player only when he's near.

46
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:15,540
Enemy's weapon damage is reduced. Standard game, right? Enemies are aware of the player. They see

47
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,740
and hear the player from the standard distance. Enemy's weapon damage is on a standard, normal,

48
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,019
regular level. Perfect for me. Game has increased difficulty. Enemies are much more aware of the

49
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:31,300
player. They spot the player easily in the open and hear him from the greater distance.

50
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,920
Enemy's weapon damage is increased. That's not real. Everyone that says play on the hard

51
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,860
difficulty don't... That's not the real difficulty. Enemy's weapon damage is increased. What are they

52
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,939
using for bullets? What's the difference? Why can they hear me from five miles away? That's not

53
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:58,550
real. This is the real difficulty. This is the realistic one. Greetings, seeker. You should have

54
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,709
already received the mask. It is a highly advanced prototype that enhances your capacity in the field

55
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:11,399
and syncs with your equipment. The mask allows you to upload contracts data to the client after

56
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:18,970
each mission. Before we drop you in the designated location, we want to make sure you understand the

57
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,449
tech we've given you. For this purpose, you'll be taken to a secure training facility hidden in a

58
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:30,889
secluded mountain location. You're going to perform a series of simple tasks to familiarize

59
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,689
yourself with the mask and for us to make the necessary adjustments. Report back when you're

60
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:49,500
at the location, seeker. All right, here we go. It's time. Do I need to know what lore is and

61
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,899
shit? I'm not just gonna jump in without knowing anything. I don't know anything about sniping.

62
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,899
Hopefully this is not realistic at all because hopefully I just aim crosshair on guys' head.

63
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,620
I hope it's not one of those things where I have to do like the distance and then left and then

64
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,740
because otherwise I'm just going to not play the game. Ready for action.

65
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:32,860
Dude, turn the game down on your mic, man. Like a rifle. Okay, hold on. This is like,

66
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,460
the graphics are too good right now. I need to like turn them down. I'm not kidding.

67
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:48,120
Doesn't it? I don't know. I must be an old fucking man. I swear to God. But I actually like it when

68
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,360
games don't look like insanely incredible and shit. I like it when they look kind of like crap.

69
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,789
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, approach the sniping spot. What about these?

70
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:06,710
What is this? Refill ammo. All right, ammo. I got 525. All right, approach sniping spot.

71
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,149
Take a prone position. Hold C to go prone. Press tab to open the tutorial. You got the reading

72
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:18,779
tutorial. They still haven't figured out how to do tutorials in all video games, huh? I know I just

73
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:27,419
did an R instead of a W. I'm stupid. This takes me out. It does. If you guys notice that, that the

74
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,700
tutorial always just takes you out. Instead of being like telling me these things as a little

75
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:43,820
robot in my ear, I have to like, what am I reading a book right now? Okay, crouch stance. Hold C to

76
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,730
go prone. Okay, changing stance to crouch. Reduces weapon sway. All right. And hold your breath.

77
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,519
You have this hold breath mechanic. Cool. All right. Note that only tall grass and bushes provide

78
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,440
fall cover. Good to know. You got to stay on a bar. It'll increase when you perform physical

79
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,399
actions like running and climbing, but it regenerates. Otherwise, your stamina level

80
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,409
determines how long you can hold your breath. Okay, so that's important. Let's go. First,

81
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:17,000
switch your mask to binocular mode. Target over there. Tagging enemies allows you to measure the

82
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,320
distance to selected targets and keep track of the system to measure your target's distance.

83
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,129
Why do I need to use binoculars when I have a huge binocular on my arm?

84
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:37,610
Rifle and see for yourself. This is just a giant binocular.

85
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:55,529
This system scales up the display.

86
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:04,169
All right. I shoot the target. So it eight. So 117 meters. That means I have to go.

87
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:09,700
What do I have to aim? That means I have to go up a little bit, right?

88
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:24,809
Below 100. That's too far. So okay, so if I'm zoomed in that 100 right there, I got to go

89
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:45,159
a little bit above that. So like right here, higher than that. See for me, it's just,

90
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:50,250
just guess for me. You know what I'm saying? Proceed to the next one.

91
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:09,830
So that's the wind check target. Aim along bullet drop cone. Shit. Okay. He's 150 away.

92
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:21,700
So I have to like drop this on his head. So he's 150. Yeah, I know.

93
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,220
What? Okay. QE. This is, this is the mechanic I was talking about the elevation button.

94
00:12:52,179 --> 00:13:21,460
280. Like that. Like that. So that's 280. Right. That's correct. Right. That's 100. What do

95
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:32,440
you mean it's 100 on the right? 100. All right. Wait, hold on. I've got to ask a question.

96
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,679
Do the, this is where anytime I play sniper game, just listen to me closely. I know. Just please

97
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,279
listen to me. Hear me out. Do the numbers on the middle of the screen in yellow,

98
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:54,149
orange mean fucking anything? Yes. No. Yes. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Okay. So this is at 280

99
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:12,950
right now. So here's, this is who said no wrong aim. This is wrong. This is not correct.

100
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,840
I have so much trouble with these. I have so much trouble with these games. I swear to God,

101
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,080
I knew it. I have so much trouble with this shit. And I know I should know what I'm doing,

102
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,820
but I don't. Because I've changed the scope. The wind. I know the wind is going down though.

103
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:42,600
I can't. I can't do it. I have to guess. Got it. I think that is a rule. What is the one on the

104
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,409
top mean? I'm going to sit here until I get it. I don't care if it takes five hours. The top left,

105
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:57,059
see two, three, four, six. Right. What does that, what does that mean? The top left is wind speed.

106
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,129
Okay. So that doesn't mean there's nothing to do with the, the, this three, four, five, six shit.

107
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:12,950
I know. Okay. I know the top one is wind. I've played plenty of golf games. I know how that works.

108
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:29,269
It's a, it's a scale so you can find the distance. Bottom is distance in meters. So this top left

109
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:35,990
one is the wind direction. See one, two, three, four, six. That's wind direction. Bottom is bullet

110
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:44,330
drop. People are just, every time I've tried, I've tried many times. I thought I, you know,

111
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm fucking staying until I figure it out. Just shoot him. I'm just going to, I'm just going to

112
00:15:48,730 --> 00:16:01,059
shoot him. I almost got him. Just shoot him. Get in discord so somebody can explain this.

113
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:28,309
How do I take this back? How far away is this guy? Everyone's flooding discord. You think I'm going

114
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:40,259
to be able to get explained to me on discord? Damn it. It is, it's like hard and you need to

115
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:46,740
like know what you're doing. I, all I know is wind and this thing of that, the cascading

116
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,590
particle effect. All right. I'm going to slow down. We're going to start at the very beginning.

117
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:04,460
Here we go. Right now I am not, I'm at, I'm not zoomed in at all. Okay. I'm not zoomed in.

118
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:13,849
When I go one tick forward, this, the numbers change here. Can someone just give me a basic

119
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,410
explanation as to why when I do one tick in at times eight, these numbers in front of me change.

120
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,890
Like they go down, like it's going down, but that's just, no, they're not changing.

121
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,329
I'm getting closer. Okay. So I figured that out. Just bear with me. I'm a koala for God's sake.

122
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:41,559
So right now, what the, that number, that 100 means what? That's distance. The top left numbers

123
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,170
are height scale. So that means that this guy, but how do I know he's a hundred meters away?

124
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,890
What are these, what are the lines in the middle mean? It will hit at a hundred meters if you

125
00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:01,859
compensate. Thank you. Thank you. That's what I wanted. So if I compensate, I'll hit this guy.

126
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,109
You have to mark him first, right? Okay. Let's mark and see how far away he is.

127
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:21,799
Okay. All right. So he's 114 meters away. So that see 200, that's how far away he is. It'll

128
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,000
hit him in the chest, right? It'll hit him right in the chest. If I compensate right there, right?

129
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:44,710
So right there. So this is going to hit him right in the fucking head. Okay. I get it. I understand.

130
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,470
So what? Okay. This is where I got fucked up. It always, what are these numbers in the two, three,

131
00:18:50,470 --> 00:19:01,769
four, six? What's that mean? What does the two, three, four, six mean? No clue. Omega low. Ignore

132
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:10,170
those. Well, aren't I supposed to know? Just ignore the top left. See, I'm under the assumption that

133
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:18,470
I have to make some fucking calculation with the stuff in the top left. All right. I get it.

134
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:33,529
This is a real tricky one for me here. 262. You understand? Check this out. 262. Look at that.

135
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:40,900
That's a headshot right there. It only took me 20 minutes to figure out how to play the fucking

136
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:48,230
game. Now, now I can play any sniper game because I always get to this part and quit.

137
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:58,099
I said that's not a joke. I, every sniper game that has this mechanic in it.

138
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,380
I, I can't figure out this first part and then I just quit again. All right. Important. I have

139
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:11,700
something really important to ask guys. What's this shit do? This like 200, 240, like 500.

140
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:20,680
That's just changing what that's to fine tune it. So if I want to, let's say the guys, let's say the

141
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,759
guy's like 600 meters away, right? And I'm just like, fuck, I can't, how am I supposed to tell?

142
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,700
So there we go. Six, it's like 600 meters that I hit him right in the head. If I compensate for the

143
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:38,519
wind, let's just say the guy's back there. All right. That was fucking ridiculous. Cause I may

144
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:49,609
as well just, I, I, I, that's how it was. What? It always seems like it's like impossible. All

145
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,019
right. Right, right. Cause I'm like, I'm zoomed the fuck in. So how far away is this guy? I don't

146
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,339
know. Who cares? Shoot him right in the light. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I think I

147
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:03,579
understand. That's how real guns work. That's all right. That's fine. All right. Let's go.

148
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:22,390
Is there no scope? Oh, we've got a live exercise here. Short range, special bullets,

149
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,109
pick up one of the weapons to try out different sets of special. This technology will increase

150
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:34,630
your options in the field and allow you to be more creative. Ooh, test a turret or pick up a

151
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:41,859
sniper rifle to test special bullets. What's wrong with one I have explosive. I just burped

152
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,819
while I was talking and that's why it sounded like that. All right. Let's do explosive.

153
00:21:45,700 --> 00:22:06,380
Press. Oh, there we go. Use explosive to hit targets. They detonate on impact. How do I know

154
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,339
how far away that is though? Let me find out. How far away is this? I can't, I don't know.

155
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,940
How come I, I can't tell how far away that is. I'm fucking, I'm useless.

156
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:35,500
That was just huge targets. Okay. Cool. They, that's actually pretty fun. Do it again. Sure.

157
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:48,500
Let's reload. All right. That's fun. Pick up an ammo box. What do we got here? We got armor

158
00:22:48,500 --> 00:23:01,990
piercing. What's what is DARPA? EMP DARPA. What's DARPA do? Top left lets you see distance based on

159
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:12,299
dude's heights. So wait, hold on. You're telling me that that that guy's 200 meters away. What if

160
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:27,670
I go like this? Can I just trick myself? No, that's not how it works. Put it on their feet. I'll put

161
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:37,319
the line, put their feet on the line. It's like that. So this guy's 212, 15. Yeah. All right.

162
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,849
Well, how the, I don't know. I've never used this before in my life. All right. DARPA bullets.

163
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,599
This is actually pretty good because now I won't rage quit every single sniper game I've ever

164
00:23:52,599 --> 00:24:08,900
played. I don't have to compensate for gravity or wind. How do I get a box of these? Can I just

165
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,819
have these? This is just cheating. All right. I'm just going to get a bunch of those.

166
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:27,210
All right. I get, I understand how it works, but I want to see what this is. Luring tagging, luring.

167
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:43,589
Why would there be ammo to luring? Dude, this is sick. All right. So now you tell me if I go,

168
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:50,069
I'm going to just let me just let me listen to me. This here. So you tell me that this thing

169
00:24:50,069 --> 00:25:03,140
is a hundred meters away. Dope. All right. Well, no, we don't need to go that far then. All right.

170
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,700
Tagging. So what am I supposed to do? Tag it or lure? How do I, there's nobody even over here.

171
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:20,630
Just shoot the ground. These guys can't even walk. It doesn't be luring people. Is it just

172
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:28,619
making noise? He's blind. What? This is a luring bullet. I mean, these guys aren't moving though.

173
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,440
Cardboard people can't walk. That's what I know. But how targets can't walk. All right. Well,

174
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,369
no, I wasn't about to leave the game. Switch to tagging bullets. What do tagging bullets do?

175
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:51,420
Probably tag people. Pick up turret. Hold to open weapon wheel and select remote turret.

176
00:25:52,059 --> 00:26:00,099
Am I going to snipe a turret? Plus F to place turret. Where? Like if I, do I call in a turret

177
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:14,680
call? Press T and switch your mass to binocular mode. Tag targets for remote turret. While in,

178
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:30,329
what? While in binocular, press H to tag up to two targets. Press H. Press G. Where the hell is

179
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:48,730
this thing? Press F to put the turret down first. Okay. I'm going to put the turret down. All right.

180
00:26:48,730 --> 00:27:07,700
I got my turret. Let's see. Tag these guys. H. Shoot these guys. Huh? From this far away.

181
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:23,059
I thought this, I thought this was like you put it down short range. Uh, all right. EMP. I think I

182
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,980
know what that does. I know what that does. It pierces armor. All right. I know what tagging does.

183
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:34,490
It tags people. Let's just make sure I know what it does. That's a hitscan weapon. That's a little

184
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:43,180
strange. All right. Let's, all right. We go. Let's just go like this. Watch that wind. All right.

185
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:59,529
Let's tag. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I get it. All right. What do I go if I get it?

186
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:23,819
Just, I'm just going to get the turret. That's all I care about.

187
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,900
This thing is not even in line of sight. That's really, really fun. Okay. Here we go. Let's get,

188
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,740
we got an AK. We've got a pistol. We got bullets. We got grenades. This grenades in this game.

189
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:47,579
Automatic plus one letter grid. All right. Press F to use selected gadget. I hate when I get

190
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:19,940
cold. AK. Good. Really loud though. Let's, let's, let's fix that. All right. Let's see if I can get

191
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:39,319
them all. Pretty good. All right. How do I leave? All right. If I hit the guy all the way in the

192
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:58,440
back and he drops right now, I get a hundred alls. Oh well. You guys ready? I am. Okay.

193
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:06,839
Altai mountains. Download Ivanovsky's plans. Find the client spy. Eliminate Demetri. Destroy

194
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:20,890
all test results. Steal samples of the virus. I thought this was a sniper game. What happened

195
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:31,259
to where's snipe the bad guy? What? Interrogate officers. Perform headshots. Gas enemies. Eliminate

196
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:37,940
without. What is all this? What is all this? Inter, how do I interrogate somebody from five

197
00:30:37,940 --> 00:31:00,140
miles away? Greetings Seeker. Just do it. Your primary target is Demetri Ivanovsky. He is a

198
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,269
former Russian armed forces general. He earned the nickname bio-efficacy. You call them.

199
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:12,940
During the second Mongolian war. Due to his persistent use of both chemical and biological weapons.

200
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:19,339
You called. His first cousin to the Siberian. That's so funny because it's, I mean, yeah.

201
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,980
During the Siberian war of independence. You ping their walkie-talkie. You just prank call them.

202
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:34,339
Cousin. Kurtadov gave him the notorious Altai 24 Soviet military research facility as thanks

203
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:41,019
for his support. Yeah. You hold the walkie-talkie and you go, what do you know? Tell me what you

204
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:45,099
know. And you smack the walkie-talkie like on a table. And then he goes on the other end.

205
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,099
All right. All right. All right. He's in the back room. Human trials of his bio-weapon.

206
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:59,769
Understand that Kurtadov plans to use the weapon to secure Siberia's disputed border territories.

207
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:10,710
Stored on an encrypted military grade laptop. Find the package, hack it and obtain those plans.

208
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,779
All right. I understand it's cold looking and there's a lot going on on the screen, but

209
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:28,700
what is this supposed to be? What these lines and the geometry, wires, what is this supposed to be?

210
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:45,049
A computer or what are we supposed to be looking at? A video? Hacking. It's like what hacking looks

211
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:53,319
like. It just defects in the camera. I just, I guess it looks maybe like on a poster or something,

212
00:32:53,319 --> 00:33:04,490
but I don't know. Whatever. All right. Let's go. Alpaya. Your first objective is to infiltrate

213
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:10,569
the enemy's facility. It's behind the electric fence. You'll have to cut the power. We've dropped

214
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:18,180
your weapons nearby. Load your map to see the cargo drop off point. All right. Let's go. Do I even

215
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:28,140
have a sniper rifle? Open M. Blue areas indicate contact locations. That's a lot of, that's a huge,

216
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:36,900
this is the legend that you see at a mall. Okay. There's, there's the target. Okay. Where's the,

217
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:44,259
where's the Nordstrom? This is a mall directory. So here, this is the box I have to go to.

218
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:57,910
So just go. Can I put a waypoint? Yep. Thank God. I'll update your map with

219
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,029
coordinates related to your contracts. You can load it via your mask at any time.

220
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:07,990
You can manually mark waypoints on your map. They'll be displayed directly on your map.

221
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:15,909
All right. You can fall off. You can fall off the edge. Okay. Cool. I need some games. Don't let

222
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,380
you do that. That's plus five. That's a, that's plus 0.2 points. So this is all right. I'm not,

223
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,260
I was just testing to see if you could fall. It's behind the electric fence. You'll have to

224
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:38,739
cut the power. What force causes me to hypothetical. All right. So I'm ready. Cool. Let's go.

225
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:44,659
Coordinates related to your contracts. You can load it for your mask at any time.

226
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:49,860
You can manually mark waypoints on your map. They'll be displayed directly on your mask.

227
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:57,340
Yep. All right. Jump. That's a pretty floaty jump. All right. Jump plus climb on. How do I do that?

228
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:05,829
Just jump and hold. This is not the video game I thought it was going to be, and neither did you.

229
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:28,730
So let's go. Dead end. Use your mask scanner. I have a scanner?

230
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:36,280
Now what would happen in real life is if you went that far up to a huge building like this,

231
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:47,750
you would just fall backwards. What was it? Left control? Uh, what? I don't know.

232
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,730
It just makes everything kind of ugly. What is this showing me?

233
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:16,780
Is there an indicator besides the triangle stuff? The pipes. I mean, I see the pipes,

234
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:34,570
but what's the point of having the sniper vision on this? Okay. Cool. I can jump that high?

235
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,760
No, you cannot. Is there a flashlight? There's no way I can jump that far down.

236
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,719
Your suit is made from extremely durable, intelligent microfibers that also support

237
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:55,960
your body's natural regeneration abilities. Yeah. Health bar regenerates, drain stops when

238
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,639
you receive damage or sprint and use med kit to full health and adrenaline shot boost regeneration.

239
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,280
Yeah. You have a stamina bar. You hold your breath and shit. I get it. Your mask sinks

240
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,760
with your central nervous system. It was killing enhancing your reflexes and coordination.

241
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,679
Meaning you will be fine. Meaning it's going to instantly break both of my legs and then

242
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:24,519
heal them instantly. So I'm still going to feel the pain both ways. See? And now they're being

243
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:43,300
restructured. How do you save the game? You don't. You don't. I say flashlight. Use my sniper vision.

244
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:55,320
I still don't understand what the fuck this does. Take him down. When the recognition bar fits.

245
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:03,690
Wow. Is this stealth? A stealth action first person shooter game? While crouching, you'll be

246
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,090
less visible and quieter. Your silhouette turns black and HUD becomes darker when you are hidden.

247
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:13,420
Right? The recognition bar fills up when the enemies start noticing you. When it's full and

248
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:26,869
it's flashing red, you're detected. That's the same indicator. Stealth kill. Press mo when prompted

249
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:32,309
to perform a silent melee attack. You can also kill enemies when hiding below their field of vision

250
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:39,750
or jump them from above. If you sneak behind an enemy, you can interrogate him. A successful

251
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,789
interrogation provides information on supplies or hostile soldiers locations. Officers who can

252
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,550
be found at every outpost can provide you with mission relevant. Let's interrogate this person.

253
00:38:49,269 --> 00:39:04,150
Where are they? Sniper vision. Is he talking to himself? What do you know?

254
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh, I didn't even do that. I didn't click that. He just did it. He did that. I didn't do it.

255
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:34,329
Oh my god. You can hide. I didn't even kill this guy. Grab body. Holy shit. You throw them far.

256
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:45,059
What? Okay. He's hidden. Wait. Duck. All right. There's a hiding place over there. Wait. There's

257
00:39:45,059 --> 00:40:01,099
enemies over here. Hiding place. All right. Approach this. He begged for his life. I did not kill that

258
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:32,599
guy. Oh shit. Throw a stone. Hold Q and A. You can throw rocks in this game. Oh shit. Prone. Oh,

259
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:50,039
I hit him in the fucking head. I hit him. I think I just put them on alert. This is an amalgamation

260
00:40:50,039 --> 00:41:22,139
of every video game. Holy shit. They didn't wait. I want to see if you can throw the rocks.

261
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:51,940
Yeah, I did. Death from above. But there's a guy right there. How would you not hear that?

262
00:41:52,739 --> 00:42:02,250
What? Why would it want me to do that? Why would it want me to do that to this guy? Hey, jump on

263
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:18,570
this guy and stab him and stomp on his head. Yes. Distract them. Yes. Use a decoy to distract. Okay.

264
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:45,659
But why don't you just walk by this? What do you know? Take down. Why was it right click? What do

265
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,949
you mean right click is take down? What are you talking about? Right. Take down. Right click.

266
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,699
I just threw a rock. What? What the fuck is going on?

267
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,139
Why did it? It was saying right click. Right click. Right. Why right click? Right click is aimed.

268
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,780
All right. Press tab to open the store. Okay. Mask. The mask mode can help you analyze the

269
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:23,269
environment. A fully developed mask will highlight interactive objects. Cool. Even through walls,

270
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:29,130
it can show camera vision cones, detect sound sources, and much more. All right. That's called

271
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:36,219
mask mode. Avoiding enemy patrols on our post can be difficult. Search for the hideouts like lockers,

272
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:40,300
trash cans. To hide this is where you can wait out alarms. You can also hide bodies in these

273
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:47,460
containers. All right. So I get mask mode. I would highlight usable items and markers. All right.

274
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,780
Pick up weapon. Yeah. I can use this. Cool. What's this thing? I can. What's the looting even do?

275
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:17,610
What's the point of looting? It's just ammo. Okay. Cool. Why hide them when you can just throw them

276
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:25,110
over? All right. I don't even need the ammo. Wait. Easy. Mask mode. All right. We're good. What is

277
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:36,460
this? Grenades. Pick. Got it. You can only carry a limited amount so keep track of your equipment.

278
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,619
All right. Cool. Grenades. On. Recon the area before you proceed.

279
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:54,809
All right. We got it. What do we got? Recon out these binoculars. We've got a electricity.

280
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:59,769
Shoot that. Electrify tank. Looks like they're guarding the transformer station ahead.

281
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:08,780
Use them by different tags and appearance. I would look for the officers. Okay. I need an officer.

282
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,539
Looks like an officer. Search him when you're done. Copy that. All right. Wait.

283
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:18,250
All right. Regular soldiers are versatile but relatively easy to kill. Sargeants are close

284
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,969
combat specialists resistant to gas weapons. Riflemen specialize in assault and can use

285
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:27,449
higher class grenades. Marksmen are long-distance killers and best to eliminate heavy. So I'm going

286
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:36,869
up against like a class-based shooter. What am I? A sniper? Heavy soldiers can withstand a lot of

287
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:44,889
damage. Try to use a heavy sniper rifle on them. Just provide information. Watch out for drones.

288
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,650
They can expose your position. Targets and bounties are always well guarded.

289
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:57,190
Some info dump. I think the the moral of the story here is yeah like somebody just said just

290
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:08,099
shoot them. Shut up and kill them. Guys relax. All right. Let's get this guy. How come I okay

291
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:14,090
everybody talk about you. How do I know if they're an officer or not? I mean that guy looks like an

292
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:21,179
officer I guess. Shit. Keep an eye out for useful environmental elements. Fuse box. Yeah. Shoot the

293
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:26,630
fuse box. You can lure enemy to avoid combat or place where you can deal with them easily. Yeah.

294
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:32,570
If you do this you can use interactive objects like generators in few boxes or gadgets like

295
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,250
decoy traps or the upgraded drone. Avoiding enemy patrols and outposts can be difficult.

296
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:45,320
Hide. All right I think I got everybody tagged right. Nobody no snipers. Okay shoot fuse box.

297
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,159
Wait how far away is it? Not that far. Wait let me just check this. All right he's like right here.

298
00:46:51,800 --> 00:47:11,619
Should I shoot this guy? No. What's he doing? How how loud is this gun? Did I get him?

299
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,559
Holy shit. Okay that was pretty cool. Uh now what? Wait this guy. Wait who's the officer?

300
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:53,860
That's the officer. I gotta clear this out. So um what else we got? This guy still has no idea

301
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:01,780
what's going on behind him. All right I'd have to interrogate this guy. Is this a zipline? Oh shit.

302
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,780
Keep your distance till they're all down. What do you mean till they're all down?

303
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,739
Is this like I have to interrogate this guy? Shoot this guy? I don't have to interrogate him.

304
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:37,300
Isn't that the officer? He doesn't know where I am. He just knows something's going on.

305
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:47,289
If I'm quiet can I climb this thing? I'll get around to him. Is there money in this game?

306
00:48:47,289 --> 00:49:19,190
That's actually kind of fun. All right I gotta get behind him. I think I'm gonna make it. How

307
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:33,300
do I get all I gotta get all the way around him? Wait I gotta throw a stone. Did I go over the

308
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:53,940
house? Ah Mike you threw it over the house. Oh that's the only ball we had. Whip the ball like

309
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,389
in the backyard with your friends. You never played like just throw a ball in backyard.

310
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:12,460
All right I'm going after him. Fuck I think I just hit the fence. Sorry I'll get him here.

311
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:36,809
Interrogate. Holy shit how did he know? What? I was in the bushes. Are you serious? Oh come on. What?

312
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:47,929
Before you get there you may need a key card to access the station. I would look for the officers.

313
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:52,650
Interrogate the officer. Search him when you're done. Search him when you're done.

314
00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:25,380
Fuck me. All right I'm gonna do this real damn quick. Altangos down. I have a live feed from

315
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:44,380
your mask you know. I thought he said for my mom. Die hard. He says dinner's ready. I just

316
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:55,179
don't want them to have electricity. All right let's search the uh officer. I don't take money

317
00:51:55,179 --> 00:52:04,039
too right? Yeah I'm gonna loot everybody. Dude I am pogging right now so hard. Really? I appreciate

318
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:24,739
that. Did I take this guy's head off? Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh I've got the key

319
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:31,780
card. Why is it giving me these wrong names? Grab body is not space. It's this mouse button.

320
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:50,599
All right let's get in. All right wait. Okay what can I do with this? Can I pick this up? Or is it

321
00:52:50,599 --> 00:53:01,880
it just explodes? Power down. The fence should be harmless now. I've marked the exfil location.

322
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,119
Shoot it point blank. Proceed there and upload your data. Exfil location will be visible on your mask

323
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:17,960
tub if you use the scanner. Copy. I did it. What do I get? Exfiltration point. When the contract is

324
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,039
complete go to the exfiltration point to see the mission summary screen. From there you can stay

325
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,639
in the region to finish other objectives so you can leave but lose any unfinished progress.

326
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:50,199
That's it? Okay let's go. Is that person right there? No it's just a tree. I gotta get the

327
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:54,199
binoculars up in case there's any danger and any people or anything right? No people?

328
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:11,500
What am I supposed to do? A bunch of stuff here? Uh 20 community subs just came in from Ben Folds.

329
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:21,480
Thanks a lot Ben. 20. Huge sub drop. That's a big one. That's a fucking big one.

330
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:34,869
Could you be any more annoying in the sky? Dude he's pogging so hard. I am. That's a lot of money.

331
00:54:42,949 --> 00:55:13,159
Two percent? Wait how? Weapons. Upgrade your gear in the loadout tab. Before each mission you

332
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,780
visit development section of the loadout tab. You can upgrade your mask suit gadgets and recon.

333
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:26,309
The first upgrades only cost cash but more advanced ones require

334
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:39,260
tokens. Don't tell me I have to buy these. Better not be. Okay shop screen,

335
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,500
find gadgets, attachments, weapons. We can look at that later.

336
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,980
Either. Both. I'm ready. It won't matter to the people they used the weapon on.

337
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:54,360
That's not your concern. Stay focused. All right what? Maybe it's just a drill. Who's talking?

338
00:55:55,159 --> 00:56:16,460
How many other? Tag him. One. He's got three. Any more? I don't see any more. Can I get three or

339
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,579
can I kill him? What's that? Is that an explosive? I think there might be an explosive barrel.

340
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:40,179
Nope. Oh shit. I missed. Who cares about the wind compensation and all that dumb stuff?

341
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:53,179
Just shoot him in the head. All right where am I going? Fast. I can fast travel? Is this like open

342
00:56:53,179 --> 00:57:02,809
world? I'm so confused. That's travel. I'm going here. We're just gonna go up there somehow. All

343
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:11,909
right what do they got? Plus one letter grade. Give it to me. It's an opportunity. She blew it.

344
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:28,980
What can I do with gas? Oh explosion. Anybody else? No. Should I hide these guys? I feel like

345
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:37,800
I need to hide them. That's part of the game right? There's a cave on the left. We'll put

346
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:59,579
them down here. I'll loot them right right right right. Oh that's a good spot to drop right down

347
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:04,150
here right? Is anybody nobody's down here? It's just trash. Yeah it's just like trash down there.

348
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:21,539
All right no one's looking down there. Now let's get up here. Take out the binoculars and let's

349
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:44,150
scope this out. Wait you wouldn't even see the news. Where is this person? It's them politicians

350
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:56,940
am I right? That game was so fun. I can't see anybody. I think I just have to get up here.

351
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:21,019
Go play it. I'm not playing that game. Slow down. Wasn't somebody just talking? Wait where am I

352
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:36,170
hearing this? Oh fuck they're right here. I need to interrogate somebody. All right I'm gonna try

353
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:49,820
to interrogate. I'll get that guy with a snipe. Another guy right there. Snipe that guy. Oh no.

354
00:59:49,820 --> 01:00:21,510
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Rock! Wait how far away is he? 126. Compensate for the...

355
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:28,550
No that's too much compensation. He's 126. So that means he's right there.

356
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:38,809
What did I hit the rock? What am I hitting? Uh oh this is very bad. I'm freaking out. My character's

357
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:48,300
freaking out. Slow down. What am I? I'm not hitting his head. Am I hitting this guy in the face?

358
01:00:54,659 --> 01:01:06,840
What he has a mask that blocks my bullets? Oh shit there's a tank. I think the tank just ran

359
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:18,650
him over. Where is that guy looking? Is somebody alive? Is he shooting on the ground? He's shooting

360
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:53,590
in the air. I'll get him. Whoa! I have to interrogate someone. What is that? Did they find me? I'm trying

361
01:01:53,590 --> 01:02:22,760
to shoot it. Just being followed around by drones. Peek out. Fuck the wind. I didn't... I forgot about

362
01:02:22,760 --> 01:03:05,210
the wind. They know. Everybody knows. Oh my feet. Right in this guy's head. All right I'm gonna move

363
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:22,469
position. Can I take the drone? Nothing even in here. This is actually a pretty good spot to snipe.

364
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:33,050
They still know where I am. Hello?

365
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:34,889
Hello?

366
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:52,710
Is it a drone? It's a fucking drone. It's a drone. Where? Where's the drone? Where is it?

367
01:03:52,710 --> 01:04:39,289
Where is this thing? Behind me? No it's not. Wait is that a guy? No. God damn it.

368
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:56,710
There's a lot of people here. I need to tag this guy. I need to know how far away he is.

369
01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:09,210
Play it right. All right. He is... What? Oh no. Oh shit. Oh we both did the same thing. We got him.

370
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:21,579
Why would you look at me with binoculars? Who is it? Who's shooting? Who's a grenade? Did I throw

371
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:54,840
a grenade? Where's the grenade? Is there a grenade here? Where is it? Where you at? I'm gonna blow

372
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:14,550
this guy up with the explosive. I'll lure him out. I fucking can't believe I missed. Did I kill him?

373
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:25,380
I need a better place to... How many people are in this compound?

374
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:44,619
There's still this many people that I have to... That was insane. All right. Damn it. They're getting

375
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:54,170
in the tank. Oh no. He's aiming at the tank over here. I didn't... Wait are they leaving?

376
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:07,500
Where are they taking this? Where are you going? You're not gonna drive into me, right? What are you

377
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:39,139
doing? Oh move move move move. How do I heal? Lie down. Yes. Oh fuck. Okay I need to throw a

378
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:50,650
grenade at this guy. It's G right? Oh my god I'm dead. Don't stand the fuck up. I'm trying to... How

379
01:07:50,650 --> 01:08:38,859
do you... Oh my god. Was it like J? B. I'm going in. I'm fucking doing it this time. Remember special

380
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:50,810
ammo? I don't think I have any special ammo. Okay so don't get spotted. These guys come back here.

381
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:54,170
I'm gonna try to shoot him through. I'm gonna try to shoot him in the head through his friend.

382
01:08:54,890 --> 01:09:05,800
Well that was fucking pretty cool. All right. I'm doing this slow because I don't want to...

383
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:35,899
There's like 30 or 40 people in here. Get in there. What was that? I heard a beep. I wish I could

384
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:48,920
save it. So now is the task here to just get in there? Find the client's spy? That's... I think

385
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:56,260
you just do whatever you want. I don't think there's a set mission here. I think I just do

386
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:14,220
whatever I want. So download the plans is this one and it's in here somewhere. Download dusk.

387
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:27,930
I already have dusk downloaded. I just tried to... I tried to prone and I apparently... My body

388
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:34,569
was too far over the edge that proning actually... I lied forward and fell face down forward into the

389
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:56,970
ground. Let me get... I want to get a better spot. All right. This is not bad. Okay. I see 269 meters

390
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:07,109
to the flag and to the supported stance. Oh shit. Okay. This is not good. Where does it go?

391
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:11,189
How many people are here? I need to do some tagging. Like I've got it. I have to.

392
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:20,520
How do I get off? Is he coming up this way? This is never gonna happen unless I tag everybody.

393
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:34,840
All right. Who else is left? Guy up top. That guy's dead. I can kill that guy but

394
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,090
I just don't want to be spotted.

395
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:51,850
All right. Secure the package. Let's get the guy. We're gonna go top down, right? We're gonna kill

396
01:11:51,850 --> 01:12:04,140
guys on roof. I'm gonna kill. Don't worry. Guys on roof first. There's only two. Supported stance.

397
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,529
Get it in there. These guys are 117 meters away which means that it's got to be somewhere around

398
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:15,289
right there. We'll be right in the head. Right there. I'm gonna wait until there's an opportunity.

399
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:43,060
Didn't tag that guy. Jesus. Okay. Nobody saw that, right? I feel like I would hear that.

400
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:48,359
I feel like I would hear that guy's watermelon head exploding. That was just like

401
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:59,420
exploding watermelon. I feel like I could hear that. 139. Somebody's gonna come out this door,

402
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:16,520
aren't they? Whatever. Let's go. Didn't the guy go in here? I think somebody went in here.

403
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:29,539
All right. Who's next? We've got two guys here. One, two there. A bunch of people over on the

404
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:36,779
right side. I can't kill these guys yet. I think I have to change position. I gotta get these guys

405
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:55,350
over here. All right. Changing position. Chat's getting restless. Turn your camera on. I don't

406
01:13:55,350 --> 01:14:03,340
have any clothes on. I've been especially naked these last few days so now no face cam. All right.

407
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:14,739
Let's get a good shot over here. Right there. What do you think over here? I think so. I've got a

408
01:14:14,739 --> 01:14:24,550
guy right there inside that building. This is getting intense. I'm like feeling this right now.

409
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:32,199
What about any others over here? No, I don't see anybody. Moving in.

410
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:42,140
Come on. I've got to keep that. I got to keep that type of like language up. You know what I

411
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:53,050
mean? Like moving in. Spotted. Top bunker. I see two. Two people. Gonna go for a collab. Because

412
01:14:53,050 --> 01:15:00,819
like otherwise I'm gonna lose you guys. Check this out. Right here. I'm gonna get a collateral.

413
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:28,920
How far away are these guys? 40 meters. It's gonna go through. One, two. Get it. Did I miss anybody?

414
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,859
Heavy weapons guy coming over here. I don't think there's anybody else this way. I'm gonna stay

415
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:41,260
here though because there's this guy right here and then there's that guy right. Okay.

416
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:47,779
It's time to start clearing. Ready? No, not yet. Can I get them both? I'm going for it.

417
01:15:47,779 --> 01:16:31,850
Fuck it. I'm going for it. Why is this guy fucking cemented? Yes. There's a guy right here.

418
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:42,329
I haven't been alerted yet. Gas canister right there. No, I don't want to alert the whole entire

419
01:16:42,329 --> 01:17:22,920
compound. Wait, not because I'm not zoomed in. You see me? Almost fucking break. Where is this

420
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,920
guy? He's still hiding. That's a cardboard box. I can't shoot through a cardboard box.

421
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:49,079
I can, but why did it not kill him? I think everyone's dead. At least the ones that I need

422
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:54,920
to kill are dead. There's one guy right here hiding behind a cardboard, an impenetrable cardboard box.

423
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:03,369
He's not moving. He's just going to stay there. Okay. Just stay there. Don't move. Why would you

424
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:25,399
move? Climb this part. You think that you would patch this wall? This is... I can just go in here.

425
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:49,939
Didn't see that guy. Take the pistol out? No, no, no, no. There's two guys right here. I wonder if

426
01:18:49,939 --> 01:19:00,340
I can interrogate one of them. Is that walking or is that the fire? Oh, fuck. He's right there.

427
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:06,920
Holy. Did he actually turn around and look? Why is he just pivoting back and forth, back and forth?

428
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:56,329
He's looking at every exit. B. B. G. Why am I not healing? Why am I not healing? B. G. T. D. F.

429
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:22,630
Okay, it's F. That guy popped out like an old light gun game. Am I good? All right, let's deal

430
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:36,279
plans. It plays a sniper game and kills people every moment with an assault rifle. Uh, you mean

431
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:42,039
three people. I killed like 15 with the sniper rifle. So what? Like I was at an eight percentile

432
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:47,239
of shooting with the with the standard shooting weapons. It was like four. It was not more than

433
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:51,560
four. I killed like 20 people with the... All right, let's go. Where's this thing over here?

434
01:20:52,359 --> 01:21:08,329
In the bunker? No scope with the sniper. I don't think you can. No, you can't. I would have done it

435
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:35,500
like three times already. Okay, easy. What's in here? I don't see any people. Stay on the tube.

436
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:56,250
Never mind. Do you see anybody? There ain't nobody here, Ryan. What up here? There's nobody in the

437
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:23,220
nest. That's odd. I just... Okay, that was like a chimpanzee in a tree. Do you see anybody? There's

438
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:35,739
like a camp over here. I'm freezing to death. Get out. Get out of the ice.

439
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:57,270
It's right here. What am I looking for? A document? Why would there be a document all the way back

440
01:22:57,270 --> 01:24:00,340
here? All right. Why was there a waypoint here? Why was there a custom waypoint?

441
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:51,699
Where was I? Over... Oh my god. I put it there. God damn it. Can I climb back up this thing? Yeah,

442
01:24:51,699 --> 01:25:08,550
right here. I'm good. You can't climb this? Yes, you can. Don't tell me you can't climb this. It's

443
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:40,819
literally squares. What the fuck just happened? I'm just going this way, I guess. Sorry, I have to

444
01:25:40,819 --> 01:26:06,170
use my fucking hacker stripy silly string vision. Okay. Now, what am I looking for? I download the

445
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:22,619
plans. So there's a computer in here. Where's the computer? I gotta find a computer room.

446
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:43,500
All right. Computer in here. That's I mean, that's a computer. There's multiple computers in here.

447
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:49,859
There's a lot of computers in this room, but I don't think it's one of these computers.

448
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:18,140
Let's try this one. Computer. Nice name. What are you guys doing? Stop. Stop it at once. Okay,

449
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:40,300
it's not in here. Try one of the other buildings. This one. This place is just trashed. It's probably

450
01:27:40,300 --> 01:28:13,510
up here. Let me look. Use the silly string vision to find the laptop. It's the laptop.

451
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:40,390
Is this a computer? No. All right. Found it. Hack it. And 17,000 dollars. I can exfiltrate.

452
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:54,659
So you exfil. All right. So you do a random mission on the map. And then you exfiltrate. So

453
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:07,140
exfiltrate. And then you do it again. I gotta kill the I can't move on from this game until

454
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:14,409
I kill the guy in this map. I have to kill the dude that came. I can't just not do that.

455
01:29:15,369 --> 01:29:29,220
All right. Extraction point. Let's get it. This is gonna hurt. That almost killed me.

456
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:34,390
I could jump from there and be fine. Guaranteed. There's more than one.

457
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:56,420
Uh, let's go to this one. Pulling the wall over here. Yeah, I did it. Jump off the roof of your

458
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:11,909
house right now and prove it. It wasn't that high. All right. So I want to get how do I get out of

459
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:22,359
here? I want to go to the I want to buy stuff. All right. Where's it? Eliminate him over here.

460
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:32,020
Let's go. I'm going in. Why is it red? I'm going in. I'm gonna I'm going I'm going for the main

461
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:50,489
I'm going for the main contract. Let's go. Nobody down here. This is the way I need to go.

462
01:30:56,010 --> 01:31:09,210
Elite sniper has to buy own gear. How do you think they get this stuff? I'm supposed to be

463
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:17,000
like a mercenary. Can you sleep for 32 weeks in this game? I feel like a lot of you are already

464
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:50,569
doing that. Yeah, I don't need to. Is he dead? Not good enough. You're gonna tell me where they are.

465
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:59,979
That way. Over at the base where all the people are. Idiot. Thanks for the info.

466
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:19,930
Found you. He's 75 meters away. Therefore, we're right there. Don't even need to zoom it in. Let's

467
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:35,000
get it. One, two, three. That's a super bullet. Should I not use this? Uh, I don't want this thing.

468
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:50,149
I only have four shots left. No, this thing. I don't want this thing. Use your pistol. Yeah,

469
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:54,069
this thing is better. It's not better, but you know. All right, let me keep going.

470
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:12,470
Oh, something in there. Might be a ammunition in here. This would be a pretty cool puzzle game.

471
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:29,000
I have to decide which one of these turns on which vent. Diaper check. That's pretty good.

472
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:39,180
This is your first stream. What would you think about the diaper check command? That's not real.

473
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:45,430
You wouldn't think I was a weirdo. You just think everyone here was a fucking weirdo.

474
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:50,779
All right, am I going the right way? No, I gotta go over there.

475
01:33:51,579 --> 01:33:58,310
Because all I even okay, it doesn't matter if I've said any of this shit before.

476
01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:02,949
If someone is a brand new viewer, I can be like, what is diaper check? What the fuck are you guys

477
01:34:02,949 --> 01:34:08,789
doing? Relax. And a new viewer will go, okay, he has nothing to do with that. What are you guys

478
01:34:08,789 --> 01:34:15,479
doing? Yeah, what's wrong with you guys? Even though it's all my fault. That's like kind of,

479
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:30,470
I mean, it's kind of interesting, I guess. Diaper check is funny and then a bunch of swears.

480
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:45,449
It seems that a lot of people want Ivanowski dead. All right, here we go. Which one are we

481
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:51,699
working for? Paying. Does it matter who or what they are? Individual, corporation, or government?

482
01:34:52,260 --> 01:35:00,310
No, I'm a bounty hunter. Take out. All right, here we go. Let's make this happen. Guy up here.

483
01:35:02,539 --> 01:35:09,260
Anybody on the other areas where there's only one person guarding this whole entire community,

484
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:14,859
I guess, wherever this is. All right, here we go. How far were you 37 meters away, which means just

485
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:30,869
Yeah, I got it. All right, they got the bad guys in here. Just a question of where

486
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:43,659
can you interrogate the bad guy? Now, I know I'm saying the bad guy, because that's just how you

487
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:49,079
generally phrase everybody that you're fighting in anything. Get those bad guys.

488
01:35:50,760 --> 01:36:19,979
It's not bad guys. It's bad guys. It's its own term. It's also a way to explain to anybody

489
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:26,069
that like what you're doing is just you're playing a video game. That's the best just

490
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:30,470
Oh, what what do you do? Why did you just do that? Why'd you shoot that guy? Ah, he's a bad guy.

491
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:35,350
You want me to go off to the nuanced explanation as to what all these people are and what they're

492
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:47,989
all doing here? Well, that's how you tell your mom what you're doing. Oh, get get that guy. Get

493
01:36:47,989 --> 01:37:06,489
that guy right there. Get that bad guy. I'll get him. Mom does not want lore. Mom does not want

494
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:28,500
lore. Mom wants to know make sure you're not doing drugs. I heard voices. He's in here somewhere.

495
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:42,500
Wait, am I gonna get an opportunity to go up? What was that? Are we being attacked? Are we under

496
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:55,510
attack? I think we're under attack. All right, we're under attack. Where do I go? We're under

497
01:37:55,510 --> 01:38:18,520
attack. What is that for? Is it me? What's that? Camera? Oh, I've been spotted on camera. Where's

498
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:49,960
the camera? Son of a gun. Well, he's in here somewhere. He's probably in there. Mom is angry.

499
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:57,100
What do you mean mom? Interrogation. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I'm being aimed at by who?

500
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:04,010
Somebody's over there. Who? Who is it? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they?

501
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:30,090
Do you guys see anybody? I want to interrogate this guy. Oh, fuck. How did I? Great. How did

502
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:45,989
that guy not? The target is running. Target is running. Target's running. Where is he? Where is

503
01:39:45,989 --> 01:39:56,739
he? Okay, I'm gonna go this way. Where is he? I don't see him anywhere. The target can see me,

504
01:39:57,819 --> 01:40:10,069
but what? Where is he? Is he looking at a camera? He's on his laptop. Is that him?

505
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:32,380
I haven't seen that shot before. Right through the lens. Yep. You never see that shit. All right,

506
01:40:32,380 --> 01:41:08,199
where's the target? What the fuck was that? Imagine hard scoping. Is he trying to pick up the guy's

507
01:41:08,199 --> 01:41:37,859
gun? Oh, no. Oh, no. Reload. Oh, that guy's got a mask on.

508
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:10,279
Are you sure it's not the full five straight minutes of here comes the nuke alarm?

509
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:21,159
It might have something to do with that. And the noise of gunfire. Got a grenade?

510
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:37,159
Where is he? Somebody's right. Did you see that? I got a camera view of somebody else hiding over

511
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:43,699
there. Did you see that? Where is he? He's like right there. The camera went by him. He was hiding

512
01:42:43,699 --> 01:43:08,859
behind a wall. Where was he? There's a lot of money here. I can hear him talking. Is he underneath?

513
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:19,420
There's too many dead bodies on the ground. I can't see. All right, let's go.

514
01:43:43,909 --> 01:43:51,720
I need to find the guy that I was supposed to... I'm just going to accidentally come across this

515
01:43:51,720 --> 01:44:07,880
guy, aren't I? Sniper, by the way. Yeah, well, this game wants me to infiltrate and stealth kill

516
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:22,310
people close and far. This shouldn't be called Sniper Contracts. What just happened in there?

517
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:33,770
I got him. That was him. He's in a hazmat suit. Oh, there's this gas. All right, I gotta get out

518
01:44:34,329 --> 01:45:05,800
I gotta get out. This game shouldn't be... All right, I'm leaving. Who? All right, out. I got him.

519
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:19,130
Wait, let me just get one more kill really far away. I want like at least 200-300 meters like this.

520
01:45:20,949 --> 01:45:21,829
Damn it, I had it.

521
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:42,819
There's no way you're gonna get more paid contracts after this. I did it.

522
01:45:43,779 --> 01:45:45,880
Did you hear the guy in the tutorial?

523
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:51,369
He said something like that.

524
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:02,819
That's what he said. The guy that's in my ear said something like that.

525
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:24,760
They're waiting for me. All right, time to bring out the assault rifle because there's gonna be

526
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:39,640
like another person here and I'm gonna get the fucking insta-killed. Uploading data. Guy in hazmat

527
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:49,960
suit. I don't know where he was or what happened but the room he was in exploded. I just aimed

528
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:57,479
down a hallway and held the button down and like five people exploded. I guess one of them was in.

529
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:09,850
There's more to do here. What's the... Destroy all test results. Steal samples of the virus.

530
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:19,210
Find the client's spy. I'm not... I kind of... This is... It's not like it just said in all capitals,

531
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:26,199
this sucks, but I mean just wait. Let me continue playing up close and far away.

532
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:45,659
Did I shoot myself in the head with the gun? You should move on to hand simulator.

533
01:47:46,539 --> 01:47:58,810
What do you mean bounty active? I just got him. Oh, that's the spy. Okay. All right, let's go.

534
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:29,420
Damn it. I need... All right, let's go. Bounty update. Find the spy. Who gives a shit about...

535
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:35,819
I mean, this is up close. Up close is more important sometimes. Why are the two not here anymore?

536
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:58,869
I got eyes. Bounty active. Entering bounty area. Who's the bounty? Is it this guy? I mean,

537
01:48:58,869 --> 01:50:08,180
there's like a lot of smoke over here. Damn it. I saw his face. Come on. Right, I bet he... He could

538
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:16,279
hear that bullet. Almost out of ammo. Without the sniper rifle, this is just an FPS game.

539
01:50:17,609 --> 01:50:23,979
Yeah, I mean it is. I mean, it's just like a... It's an open-ended just run around and...

540
01:50:25,539 --> 01:50:29,380
Holy shit, that guy was blending and smoking a cigarette. That guy was... I didn't even know

541
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:54,439
he existed. I mean, okay, here's one takeaway. It's kind of cool that there's just... It's an

542
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:58,279
open-ended game where you just can walk around and do whatever you want. There's no missions.

543
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,439
It's just... Here's all the things that we want you to do here. Go do it somehow.

544
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:13,500
I guess that's kind of cool. But I don't even think I... I mean, leaving the bounty area. Where?

545
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:44,409
That was... Yeah, that was poor timing. I know. I'm dead. Yeah, all right. It's like, here's a

546
01:51:44,409 --> 01:51:47,930
sniper, but no run through this place where there's a bunch of people walking around and shoot them

547
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:52,329
with the gun. Sniper, but it's a sniper game. But don't use your sniper. Well, you should be

548
01:51:52,409 --> 01:51:57,850
using your sniper, but recon, but don't recon. Stealth, but don't stealth. Be far away. Be close.

549
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:14,840
I guess you can just do it any way you want. That's kind of the point, isn't it? All right,

550
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:35,210
this is gonna be tricky. Here on a Star Wars planet. Another one? Wait, Captain what? Captain Ivan...

551
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:43,609
That's him! That's the guy! I have to kill that guy. Did I actually miss that? I went through his...

552
01:52:44,409 --> 01:53:05,909
Where is he? He has a grenade in his hand. I don't need to go any further. Let's go

553
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:25,500
find the spy. Let's move. All right, let's get in there. Wait, I can do a super... I can do a kill

554
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:37,590
thing, right? That worth more points? This is a shotgun. Like, why would you give a guy a shotgun

555
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:57,539
and a sniper? Like, I want to use this right now. Okay, in here, I gotta find the spy, then use it.

556
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:01,699
I already got the bounty. What do you mean, leaving the bounty area? Wait, do I have to like, prove it?

557
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:14,260
Did I already get that guy? I already killed him. I don't think I care. I already killed the guy.

558
01:54:21,369 --> 01:54:55,770
I apparently failed the bounty. Where is he? He's in the trees. Where the fuck is he?

559
01:54:56,810 --> 01:55:07,850
Now, this is what I call... That's a... I deserve at least a hundred pop champs for that one.

560
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:52,460
Dude, why do I have to take off their shell? I'm so confused. He's hiding? He's not firing at me.

561
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:35,609
Oh my god! I don't need to heal yet. I have to go this way, so... He's the same... I can't even see

562
01:56:35,609 --> 01:56:50,390
through the tree. I'm throwing a grenade over there. Sometimes you have to do it. I'm out of ammo.

563
01:56:51,029 --> 01:57:00,340
What's with the enemies always narrating their actions? Why can't they just stealth grenade or

564
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:10,199
stealth reload? You know, that is true, but I guess it's to tell everybody that you're...

565
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:20,069
Hey, I'm in trouble, or I'm... Somebody cover me, or... All right, only four shots in the sniper rifle.

566
01:57:20,069 --> 01:57:44,199
All right, I gotta find the spy. Hey, German, this is Matthew. We've seen that copypasta so

567
01:57:44,199 --> 01:57:55,260
many times now. I can't see shit. You gotta take their hard shell off and then shoot him in the face.

568
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:04,500
Uh-oh, to the right. There's a whole encampment over there. All right, am I still in the zone?

569
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:20,920
Not really. He's over here. Two bullets. That's it. Don't fall down there. What the hell is this guy?

570
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:29,539
He's like either in here or he's this way. Is there a building over here? There's a little camp up

571
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:36,579
there. That's where I just was. Wait, slow down. That's a bright light. Is there a tank?

572
01:58:43,159 --> 01:58:56,470
Uh, I don't know what that is. No. I found the agent. He's dead. Retrieve any lab samples he was

573
01:58:56,470 --> 01:59:06,380
carrying. Here, lab samples. I cannot find any samples. I am disappointed, seeker. Did that take

574
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:11,659
too long? I've marked safe exit points on your map. Should you choose to exfiltrate now?

575
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:55,699
I gotta spend some money, guys. That was not ideal, I know. Wait, I need to... I need health and ammo

576
01:59:55,699 --> 02:00:03,079
and shit. Don't kill them. What do you mean don't kill? This is a game about killing people.

577
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:24,390
Don't kill them. What would you like me to do? Just run by them? Oh, there is no knockout. Bounty

578
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:36,199
active. All right, I gotta... I'm going... I want to go in and buy something. I feel like I've been

579
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:39,560
stuck on the first mission. I'm just doing the first mission. I'm doing everything in the first

580
02:00:39,560 --> 02:01:03,960
map. We've been on snow level for two hours. All right, how do I just leave? I kind of don't want

581
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:17,659
to do that, though. Destroy all the test results? Steal samples? All right, main menu. Yeah, let's

582
02:01:17,659 --> 02:01:29,020
go to... Remember the loadout screen? Isn't there a loadout? Contracts. I guess I'm just on this.

583
02:01:29,659 --> 02:01:42,630
You just have to do this one. Loadout. There we go. Loadout. I have $163,000. Look at... Okay,

584
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:48,659
this is what I should have done from the very beginning. Damage, firing rate, stability,

585
02:01:49,859 --> 02:01:55,560
noise reduction, so that people hear this shit. People hear this really... It's very loud.

586
02:01:55,560 --> 02:02:03,300
I want the most expensive one. It's this one. Preferred range. I'm gonna sneeze. I'm sorry.

587
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:13,750
I caught it. I want... This one's in tons of damage, but why do I care about that?

588
02:02:15,619 --> 02:02:22,229
I want complete noise reduction. This one here. All right, that... This is... How is this bad?

589
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,319
More damage, more fire rate, more stability, more damage reduction. Oh, a little bit less

590
02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:49,189
mobility. Who cares? Oh. Well, I need tokens. Mobility, firing rate, stability. I'll try this

591
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:52,710
one. It's loud, but I mean, it's got better stability, more fire rate, and I can move around

592
02:02:53,029 --> 02:02:57,819
and snipe. All right, I bought it. Now what? Can I do anything else with it?

593
02:02:58,619 --> 02:03:07,510
Developing. There's a skill tree. Mask. How many points do I need? $25,000.

594
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:18,520
Oh, I can make... I can get the turret. No, I can't. Suit. Stamina regenerates faster,

595
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:26,569
adds Kevlar armor layer to the current armor. You're harder to detect. I want to go to that

596
02:03:26,569 --> 02:03:36,039
level. I don't want to be in the snow level. This level looks cool. Turret. Increases remote

597
02:03:36,039 --> 02:03:43,739
sniper turret fire range. That's not... I need to, like, get the turret. Okay, secondary weapon.

598
02:03:47,289 --> 02:03:56,140
I want this to be heavy, heavy damage. I don't care about noise. I mean, this is... I already

599
02:03:56,140 --> 02:04:07,479
have it on. What was the sidearm? Ooh, magnum. Fire rate, mobility, ammo capacity. I like this.

600
02:04:07,479 --> 02:04:16,220
That's too much. I can't buy it. I'm getting the magnum. All right, med kit, fire grenade,

601
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:30,939
and then turret. Where's the turret? I need challenge tokens. God damn it. Warning device?

602
02:04:31,899 --> 02:04:47,180
This is a cool ad. What do you mean, ad? I'm just trying to pick weapons. I can't do the

603
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:55,350
turret, guys. Unfortunate. Let's go to development. I'm going to do, uh, more, yep, detection.

604
02:04:56,310 --> 02:05:11,399
Hard to detect. Uh, more armor. Uh, more sniper ammo. Yep. Uh, okay. Okay. All right, I just

605
02:05:11,399 --> 02:05:32,819
got to... You're in the middle of another mission. I don't understand.

606
02:05:32,819 --> 02:05:52,630
I already did this. I just said continue. I said continue. Do I just do this again?

607
02:05:57,930 --> 02:06:01,770
No, I already... I already have everything. All right, let's try fast traveling.

608
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:10,970
Fast travel to here. What else do I need in order to play the next game?

609
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:30,409
Um, 500 million dollars and I'll switch. Let me try my new rifle. Oh, let's go. We can do it.

610
02:06:30,409 --> 02:06:38,300
We can hit it. All right, the next time I die, well, I'm just going to play Dusk. I mean,

611
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:42,619
the game's, it's all, it's pretty fun. It's all right. I wouldn't say this is like my favorite

612
02:06:42,619 --> 02:06:57,689
game ever, but I'm still interested. Dude, people think I lose interest in a video game real quick.

613
02:06:58,489 --> 02:07:15,930
Yeah, here's the thing. What if I don't die? All right. Steal the data. Steal samples of the virus.

614
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:22,420
I'm going to steal the samples of the virus. Steal the samples. All right. There's like a package

615
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:33,720
in here for me. Where is it? Public media. I got 4,500 bucks for collecting that collectible.

616
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:45,060
So I just need to get back in here and steal the plans. All right. Fine. I won't even play

617
02:07:45,060 --> 02:09:16,649
with the sniper. Fine. All right. I was gonna... I'm fine. Oh, shit. Sample. Where's this damp sample?

618
02:09:17,609 --> 02:09:56,760
There's no, that's not a sample. Give me a sample. I need, where are the samples? Sample? That looks

619
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:27,819
like a sample. May days? This little fucking lunchbox is the sample. Are you kidding me?

620
02:10:37,850 --> 02:11:42,699
Fine. Avoid combat. Good luck. Extraction point. Jump the fence. Jump the fence. If I die,

621
02:11:42,699 --> 02:11:55,289
game turns off. I'm trying. I'm playing like full on FPS game right now.

622
02:11:56,090 --> 02:12:35,659
Where is he? I'm going to finish the rest of this fucking level without dying.

623
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:59,020
That better be a pog. 32% completion. Let's go back up there. I'm going. Who cares? Just go.

624
02:12:59,909 --> 02:13:15,579
I think I can do it. I think I can do it. I'm just going to play like this. Just check this up.

625
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:25,619
Up here. I don't need to fast travel. We got to go up here. We got to destroy the test results.

626
02:13:25,619 --> 02:13:33,590
You got it. I'm getting myself ready for dusk. Dusk is all about like spin,

627
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:36,310
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, twist, twist, twist, twist, twist, turn, twist, turn, turn,

628
02:13:36,310 --> 02:14:15,859
twist, turn, shoot. I would have had it. All right. Only a hundred miles, a hundred meters.

629
02:14:16,579 --> 02:14:40,649
It just took forever to reload that. God damn it, man. Really? It's not.

630
02:15:10,939 --> 02:15:46,220
Find another way in this way. Attention span here. It's like I know where I'm going.

631
02:15:46,220 --> 02:16:10,069
Okay. Fuck. I was doing so well too and I'm just going too fast. Whatever. Who fucking cares?

632
02:16:10,869 --> 02:16:26,250
I wish I could play the other levels. It's almost like this game wants you to have this drop in,

633
02:16:26,250 --> 02:16:41,379
drop out sort of mentality, but you have to stay here until when? Do I have to do all the major

634
02:16:41,379 --> 02:16:47,979
objectives before I can do anything else? All right. Let's play dusk. I've never played dusk.

635
02:16:47,979 --> 02:16:49,979
I have no idea what happened. It's probably going to be fun.

636
02:16:53,159 --> 02:17:21,559
Let's just do dusk. Okay. Is this game good? Okay. You're going to get mad. Am I?
