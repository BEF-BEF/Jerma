1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:14,580
He's on time. I am on time. I made it. I'm here. And I got the tweet out too. Seconds to spare.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,649
Yeah, well, I started at 12.59. But it takes two, three minutes for it to process through the

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,539
internet and then go through your screen and then get to your computer. Why are my lights not on?

4
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:50,939
My lights aren't even turned on. Yeah, I have one of those, like, click click lights. Hey, there we

5
00:00:50,939 --> 00:01:02,969
go. Now I can see. Is this title too too much? I think it is. I kind of have to change this title.

6
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,200
The title is hurting me. Well, there's a reason why that I made the title the way it is.

7
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,040
Today we're going to play. Well, first of all, let's go right to business. Let's talk about

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,189
what's going on. Hey, how have you been? It's been a few days. I don't want to get right to business.

9
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:36,420
We actually got a couple things to talk about. Maybe one thing. It's hard to talk remotely

10
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,890
seriously when this is on my screen. I'm sitting here like, hey, let's talk about some serious

11
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,010
stuff. There's like a pancake blueberry guy dancing on the screen. How can I be serious?

12
00:01:48,569 --> 00:02:00,260
That's what I have to look at. The title of this game is sometimes to deal with the difficulty

13
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,780
of being alive. I need to believe there's a possibility that life isn't real. That's the

14
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:17,319
name of this game. I would have abbreviated this. I don't think this even fits on Steam.

15
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:26,120
Does this dot dot dot at the end on Steam? You thought this was a joke? No, no, this is real.

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,389
Those of you that don't know, typically maybe 30, 40 minutes before a stream starts, I get in the

17
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:38,389
chat and we just talk. We go over lottery numbers. We go over our favorite animals.

18
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,150
And then sometimes we're talking about the game that's going to be played in the next 30, 40

19
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,270
minutes. So I did a poll, a couple of polls. Usually I throw it up there if I have like

20
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,069
something I like to do or something that I want to do. And everyone thought that this was fake,

21
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:59,219
that I was just putting this up here to be like a weirdo. No, this is an existential game. There's

22
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:06,840
no end. There's no beginning. You just play it. I don't know if this could be fun. Somebody

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,659
requested this. And I tell you, I take requests dead seriously. That recommendation channel,

24
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:23,509
if you have a recommendation, put it there. I look at it all the damn time. I am absolutely serious.

25
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,930
If you don't think, oh no, I'm not going to recommend that. There's no way he'll fucking

26
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,530
play it, right? No, there's no way. If I put something in that channel, is it possible that

27
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:41,770
he might just like glaze over it and and not care? And no, I think I'm good. I don't think

28
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:51,560
he'll play that. I don't think he ever would. Don't worry. If you got something interesting,

29
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,879
put it in that channel. I'm all about the interesting things. Why is there no audio?

30
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:13,319
No, that's why. Because there's music here, isn't there? Yes, there is. Well, now that makes more

31
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:22,620
sense is why the sprinkle bread guy is dancing. How long do you think I can stay on this screen

32
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:37,500
for? This is a starting soon screen. It just is. Hold on. Like, oh, that's a gerba is starting soon.

33
00:04:38,139 --> 00:05:00,410
I need to see. Okay, we're gonna make that. Let's do orange or something. All right, here we go,

34
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:35,980
guys. Hey, let's turn the stream on. Starting the stream right now. Okay. Okay. Oh, hey,

35
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:46,819
hey, what's going on, guys? Hope you had a good day today. Me, Jeremy. Nice to see you. Happy

36
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:54,379
birthday to all of you birthday people out there today. Got a special one for you tonight.

37
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,149
Have you been playing? Sometimes there's a possibility that life and death are the same

38
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,470
thing and it's not even real in the first place. There's a possibility that I've never

39
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:12,220
found it to begin with. That's the name of the game we're playing. Let's go. All right. How do I?

40
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:20,939
All right. Hey, buddy. I'm going on vacation tomorrow for my birthday. I told you happy birthday.

41
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,629
Awesome. Happy birthday. Awesome. All right. There is no beginning and no end to this game.

42
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:41,370
Who's gonna go? I don't. I'm not even gonna get told how to control the game.

43
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:59,459
I have a traffic light on my back. There's a punch. Uh, okay. Try to examine the things over here.

44
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:09,939
Oh, there's a sprint. All right. So if this is, if I was making a video right now,

45
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,139
okay, you ready? Those of you that are like, oh, man, remember, remember when he used to make

46
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,240
videos? What I would do here is after about a minute is like, what, what just happened right

47
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,720
there? Like, oh, how do I play this? Left click, right click. Oh, I don't know. There would be a

48
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,519
cut right here and it would cut to police sirens and wanted stars in the top right. And I'd be

49
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,519
running around like punching and screaming and stuff. That would be like the joke for this part.

50
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,319
That's what I would do. I'm not even 10 seconds into the game and I know that's what I would do.

51
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:59,060
Is this an NPC? I want to chat. Uh, okay. I thought he was grabbing me. I thought he was grabbing

52
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:15,430
me one star. Uh, I don't think I want to do this. I'm busy. Can't talk now. I don't like this. I

53
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:29,579
don't like what's going on here. Hey, you're so dumb. You think I'm a computer. Obviously I'm not.

54
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:40,700
Uh, who's running around with these people in the background? What? Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,299
What's going on in the background? That's important. There's like a half house there.

56
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,419
Where are you from? Um, I'm not, I'm never gonna tell anybody where you from online.

57
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,690
What are you doing? I was gonna write like Ohio. Did you just converse with a human?

58
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:12,389
That was a machine. Lost one. Yes. Hold on. What? Oh, it's, it's people. There are people.

59
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:36,440
There are no people in this game. What do I have to do? What happened? Did it break? Uh,

60
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,190
oh, I just lost my HUD. Is this part of like the existential part of the game?

61
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,179
Sometimes to understand the actuality of the universe, you have to fucking combine two or

62
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:42,860
three atoms in the root of all square roots. I'm coming back. Hold on. Come on. I still think it's

63
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:51,240
funny. And that's all I care about. I think that's funny. Some of you comedy fucking scholars,

64
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,090
maybe a little bit. I think that's funny. All right. Single player. What the fuck's happening?

65
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:15,820
How do I get out of this place? I just want to play the game. Okay. That's clearly not a robot.

66
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:25,590
I don't think this is a robot. How do I talk to this person? Go away. I'm swimming. I want to talk

67
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:34,419
to you. Come here. Go away. This is not my head. Oh, go away. I'm picking up items. This is not,

68
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:48,980
we're even picking up items. Two. Did I get two items? Press E to interact. This is a guy from

69
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,340
Pee Wee Herman. An artist was secretly hired by the Bolsheviks when he was 14 to try and ruin

70
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,860
Western culture. He becomes an egomaniacal misogynist who hides gold bars under his bed.

71
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:10,009
Everyone loves him and admires him. Institutions teach children to be like him. Um, that's a little

72
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,289
too deep for Pee Wee Herman. Can you just say the word of the day? It's like sofa.

73
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:22,519
Ah! Would you like to play pizza in the woods? No. Wait, should I have said yes?

74
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:35,190
Somebody's just lying on the ground. Oh, I got something. Turning on radio.

75
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:54,019
Is this a real song? No, no, no. This is a real song. This is a, no, of course it is. No,

76
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:03,240
you just, okay, go away. I'm in a conversation. Holy shit. Is this music? Is this music?

77
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:15,799
What a sick computer set. Look at that. That person is all over the place. That's fucking

78
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:21,320
Bitcoin. That's fucking Ethereum. That's gold, silver, platinum. That's all.

79
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Except if it was gold, it would be pretty high.

80
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,149
I just, I want to go near the song. A capitalist buys up all the aspirin to control the headache

81
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,509
market. He stores it in a giant warehouse just outside the city. One hot day, the aspirin melts

82
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:46,470
and forms the largest privately owned lake in the country. It costs 10 bucks for a swim.

83
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:53,879
I feel like this is, you put on headphones and you walk around and press the buttons at the museum.

84
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:03,129
Now stop playing music! The beginning of every fucking battle royale game.

85
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,899
All we need is the guy that crawls around, the three people that crawl around prone,

86
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,539
and then the one guy that punches everybody in the face like over and over again. All right,

87
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm talking to you. Come here. I feel like I've done this move before. On camera. I have. I've

88
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:34,710
done that exact fucking move and you've seen it like a thousand times. All right, I'm going

89
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:42,340
to go play the pizza one. How do we do anything? I thought I was supposed to be only, okay, here we go.

90
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:58,570
Hey, where are you from? From Ohio. I hate my job.

91
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:17,529
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was a machine. All right, let's go play the pizza game.

92
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:32,580
What am I gaining here? I'm gaining some kind of weird currency. Pizza in the woods, a walking

93
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,220
simulator. Leave idle and pizza will walk and fly by himself or explore on your own with WASD in

94
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,899
the mouth. There are things to see in four corners of the forest and a lake to swim in. Hit escape

95
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,730
to return to Polly's pond. I feel like that's something nobody wants to do on his own.

96
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,019
All right, so my hand, I'm just watching this with you guys. We're watching the same thing.

97
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:05,830
There's nothing more hilarious than the urgent care waiting room. What the fuck is going on?

98
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:20,860
Fires on cocaine and the elephants have learned to use email. They're writing letters to giant

99
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,220
squid who are saving their ink for perfume that makes bats horny. The bats are making babies to

100
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,700
replace the supreme court justices. It's all been signed off on set of four. Annex is playing the

101
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,580
flute on top of it. This is what happens when you take a dose higher than you're supposed to

102
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:43,419
take of acid. First of all, just don't do it. I'm not going to condone any of that.

103
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,940
Don't take drugs, ever. Don't take too many of them because they end up writing a sentence.

104
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:57,139
I see that person in the corner with their eyes wide open saying all these things. Just don't do

105
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:04,230
drugs. They're not good for you. Take Tylenol. If you've got a headache, take Tylenol. Aspirin.

106
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,789
I did just say the thing that the museum button press thing just told you not to do.

107
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:17,190
It's documented evidence of why things like marijuana are beneficial to the human body

108
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:25,190
taken in the right way. It's good for pain relief and especially for irritable bowel disease as

109
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:31,819
well. Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. Be careful when you do drugs. If you

110
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:42,859
don't do them, just don't do them. Can I have control again? I have no more control. A pizza

111
00:17:42,940 --> 00:18:00,900
like Pizza Paul, whatever his name is. What am I throwing? Are those jacks?

112
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:14,339
If you can just do something different than your parents, it is a major accomplishment.

113
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:31,509
These are just acid fortune cookies. Oh, something's going on here. Why is this

114
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:50,119
getting so laggy? All right, what is laptop lap dance? Return to main level. How do I

115
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:57,829
teleport? Return to main level. Should I find something in here? There's probably something

116
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:11,880
in here to do. Hey, you want to ditch the stream and light up? No, I can't, man. I can't.

117
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:28,150
All right. I can't, man. What is this? Should I go to find the laptop? There's like two rockets

118
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,589
and stuff apparently out here. There's things to see in the corners. There we go. I found it.

119
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:40,309
I found the portal. I can't wait until the wild development team. I know I make a wild reference

120
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:45,980
every single stream, but I have to. That's the portal. That's the original portal in what was

121
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,500
the name of the zone for the Emerald Nightmare, the Emerald Dream. That was the Emerald Dream

122
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,019
portal. It was right behind a dragon. There were four dragons in the world. What was his name?

123
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:04,900
Duskwood, right? That portal that was behind. What was the dragon's name? It was in there for

124
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:27,500
eight years. I'm not telling a joke. I'm giving a wild reference. What is this? Toilet? All right.

125
00:20:38,460 --> 00:21:17,299
How many more times am I going to do it? Is it naked? What? Holy shit. What is that?

126
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:34,539
Well, this looks different. Is that pencil? Whoa. Is it an actual pencil NPC?

127
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:51,109
How do you talk to the pencil? Holy shit, dude. Duskwood. Okay. This is somebody's house. I don't

128
00:21:51,109 --> 00:22:04,809
like this. I want to go through this quickly. I don't like this tunnel. What am I doing? What's

129
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:15,640
going on? Why am I sitting? What do you mean you can't believe that? That sounds awesome.

130
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:43,059
That's not it. No, I get it. You guys thought this was going to be like a meme. You know,

131
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:53,960
this is like an existential fucking like serious game. Why is it dark? All right. I kind of want

132
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:05,670
to get away with getting from the pizza place. I want to get out of the pizza place. This gives

133
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:12,150
me like freaking me out. A fox and a cricket develop a deep friendship in the Buruburu forest,

134
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,910
but the humans are encroaching with their subdivisions and shopping malls.

135
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,390
The fox and the cricket organize all the animals in the forest and they commit group suicide.

136
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:48,230
All right. So, um, can I do the test again? Run. I'm going up here. Is there anywhere else I can go?

137
00:23:52,250 --> 00:24:11,940
Bed? Painting? I can't like hold down and go like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Something going on

138
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:45,480
over here. There's a guitar hero controller. Give me some music. I don't want to do it.

139
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I have to. I can't help it.

140
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:15,079
I can't stop. I can't stop. I need to do it.

141
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:24,869
It's all I care about. I don't care about anything else. I'm losing my mind right now.

142
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:31,140
Wait, wait, just wait. Just wait, wait. Okay.

143
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:13,829
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. People are probably fucking pissed. I can't help it. Okay. What else

144
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:17,750
can I do? That's the only thing I've been able to do in this game is just zoom in on people doing

145
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,109
that dance. I really should be paying attention to the message that the game is trying to convey,

146
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:28,309
right? Like the messages and the things that you should be thinking about. All right.

147
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:39,450
What the fuck was that? Somebody's driving by really fast in a car with windows down.

148
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,410
You know, I love, anytime that happens, I laugh my ass off. When you get this like,

149
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:51,160
oh, it's coming from over here. You know, like you're at a red light and the guy,

150
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,400
somebody pulls up next to you and you hear it. You're talking like your mother in the front seat.

151
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,039
Like, oh yeah, I really do think that it's, yeah, I think that the best part about,

152
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,640
um, uh, yeah, no, no, yeah, that will get milked too.

153
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:16,549
Look at that windows down. You got your windows down. Is anybody going to roll them up?

154
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,430
No, the person is going to be like, just get fucking rolling his windows up. You don't like

155
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:30,789
my music. Topical stand up. You know, you know, when you pull it up at a red light.

156
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:45,589
So I did say that this is going to be, I did say I've been, I've been very clear that we were

157
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:50,230
going to either play this for 30 minutes or two hours and it's been 30 in 30 minutes. What was

158
00:27:50,230 --> 00:28:17,430
that? Is it stack city? Yeah. Okay. This is a lot. We got, try to read this. I'm not going to read

159
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:31,140
this. Should I read this whole thing? That's too many. That's too many words. I think picture a

160
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,819
dark room in your head. It's night. Maybe just a little bit of moonlight is creeping in through a

161
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:39,059
window so you can just make out some of the silhouettes of some objects. The pictures on

162
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,380
the wall are black. The couch is black. The table is black. The lamp over the couch is black. The

163
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,339
air is dark blue. Take out the ceiling. Look at the room from above. All you see is blue and black.

164
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,980
Now turn on a lamp in the room. It spreads over everything. The pictures are white. The couch and

165
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,339
rug are over saturated warm colors. Yellow is pouring out from the window. It's so bright. It

166
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:06,099
hurts your eyes and you have to squint, but you stay in the room anyway and bask in the glow.

167
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:13,720
You feel so nice. Now there's a light on your head. And let me tell you something, Larry. Get

168
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:36,779
the fuck out of here. Now there's a light in your head. That's one of the best shows of all time,

169
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,460
by the way. Kirby Enthusiasm is one of the best fucking comedic actors. Some of the best comedy.

170
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,299
Just true quick witted fucking real comedians. Not me.

171
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:50,549
Bart Simpson. No, no, no, no. Bart Simpson's not part of that group. I just saw that and had to say

172
00:29:50,549 --> 00:30:02,099
it and I think that's Bart Simpson. Okay. What do I press? No, no, no, no. This is another one of

173
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:17,019
these. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here we go. I had somebody wash my face with rose water.

174
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:26,309
My bedroom window, but I don't think I could actually see it. Okay. Well, what else is going

175
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:34,539
on? Let's think about the private parts of my ancestors. How much they... I don't want to think

176
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:41,140
about that. I really don't want to think about that. I'm not sure I want to. I don't want to

177
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:54,309
look at it. I don't want to look at this one either. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

178
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:36,069
I need to fix it. It's wrong. One of these times I'm going to do this and I'm actually just going

179
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:40,789
to get up and fucking leave for like five minutes. I will drop a thousand viewers, but like, I don't

180
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:57,240
know. It might be worth it. In the shower, my girlfriend art pieces is when a Russian cosmonaut

181
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,839
plugged a hole in the international space station with a thumb knife. But Billy Hilliard's space

182
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:05,430
was prevented from seeping into the astronaut's small living pot. Since the thumb around the same

183
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,029
time back on Earth, they're already receiving a real astronaut breakdown. He's advanced nothing

184
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:13,589
into space, aspiring with corrupt leadership to take a branch on Earth's improbable complexity.

185
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:42,970
That's like an emote. That's the emote I would expect to like have like react to this. We've got

186
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:52,680
some overlap here. Let's get to the frame. Let's get to the top. In the shower, my girlfriend

187
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:02,869
from a young age, William Blake, I don't... This is freaking me out. I don't like this. And maybe

188
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:19,589
it's... Maybe that's by design. Homo sapiens die off. Some of the computers we program to act like

189
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:25,509
us live on. What if a future homo sapien, homo species, is able to communicate with us through

190
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:30,470
our AI? Will they be convinced to click on links that claim to forgive their mortgages and have

191
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,470
pictures of large breasts over they have a conversation that inspires them and makes them

192
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:49,740
miss us? Holy shit. That's a good point. That's a great point. What will they do?

193
00:33:49,740 --> 00:34:03,140
What the hell's gonna happen? I think the five-point narrative structure has ran its course,

194
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,859
homelining with the Sopranos. Lately, when I put on a movie or TV show, I get so bored and barely pay

195
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,659
attention. I browse the web and send messages. I just want bright, warm lights on all around me.

196
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,980
Things to glance at and be reminded I'm not alone in the universe. I don't know. Five-point structure

197
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:35,429
I mean, it's... The Sopranos is one of the best TV shows ever made. I mean, I want your... I want

198
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,510
your character creator because I definitely would make something like this in like the journal

199
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:51,030
record. I would love this creator. Give me one of these WWE. I love the idea of a tulpa, a spiritual

200
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,590
being you make with your focused mind that acts independently from them. I'm always having dreams

201
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,030
where I interact with people I've never seen in waking life. That's true. Happens to me too.

202
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,750
I've fallen in love and grown very angry with people that don't exist. I probably have a lot of

203
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,670
tulpas in me I could create if I ever really concentrate. A capacity for creating

204
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,230
analogical spaces could be the greatest thing about us or make us the shortest surviving of

205
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:21,510
all the species. Dude, I... I'm telling you, I've had dreams before where like I had this... It's

206
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:28,789
like me and my dad in our house, but it's just some bald guy with a mustache. My dad does not

207
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:39,780
have a mustache. I am of like Irish and Polish descent and like this guy in my dream

208
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,900
he's in like a few of them is like an Italian guy. He's like an Italian guy with a mustache.

209
00:35:44,900 --> 00:36:01,099
He's not my dad. So I don't know. I have no idea why. Why does that happen? It's not Mario. Oh,

210
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:14,409
you guys, it's not fucking Mario. It's just... It's what it just is. I play too many video games

211
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:21,449
and fucking Mario has been burned in my brain as like dad. That's also kind of messed up

212
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:31,139
and maybe that's... What's going on? I want to keep... What's going on? Trees. Trees. Gathering.

213
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:45,219
Gathering. Humans. One human at Pala... Pawn. So? What the fuck? Oh, I forgot to tell you guys this

214
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:48,260
story. It's about sleeping. This is important. This has nothing to do with anything going on

215
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,619
the screen. Nothing at all. So, um, you know, every so often I tell you guys a story about like

216
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:58,500
Kim and I with some like weird shit happens when we're in the same... We're sleeping in the same

217
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:05,139
room sometimes. Like she'll have a dream or I'll have like a dream or something funny will happen.

218
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:11,300
So why are you rezzing sleeper? I don't even... This is fucking fun. This is a funny story and

219
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,780
I'm gonna tell it and I don't even care if you think it's a boring story. I thought it was funny

220
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,579
and that's what we do on this stream. We talk about funny things that happen in my... What a crazy

221
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,460
fucking life, right? What a wild life I have, right? Listen to me. All right. So Kim gets up

222
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,380
sometimes in the middle of the night and then goes to the bathroom. I do it too, but I was dead

223
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,659
asleep. I'm lying on my back and I'm dead asleep and I heard her start to move around and start to

224
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,619
stir, if you will, right? So she kind of turns and she sits on the edge of the bed and that's

225
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:46,340
when I started to wake up and I didn't know... I didn't see what she was doing. I'm looking at her

226
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,739
back, right? So her back and the back of her head. So she's sitting on the edge of the bed and she

227
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:56,039
leans forward and this is the first thing I remember. My eyes just open. I see this. I hear

228
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,659
and she leaned forward. I thought she shit diarrhea in her pants. Just like leaning forward,

229
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:11,670
just shitting her pants, but she was blowing her nose, but in my... I just barely got out of sleep

230
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:19,050
in my... I'm... I just am becoming conscious. I was just like, what are you doing? Are you okay?

231
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,909
He's like, why would anybody sit up on the edge of bed, lean forward and just

232
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:38,309
fucking... You know what? What? I really thought it happened. It was a huge nose blow.

233
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:45,050
That's a funny story. That's a funny like, be it my girlfriend, you know, like funny things.

234
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:55,829
Why is that a story? Because we're talking about sleep and dreams and stuff. What? You don't think

235
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:06,340
that that's like a humorous story? That's not even a boomer story. Was it a boomer story?

236
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,530
I thought it was really funny. Oh, we have something else.

237
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:23,289
A man is so anxious he can't stop grinding his teeth. He grinds them so hard they start to break.

238
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:29,130
This makes him even more nervous and he starts to grind the broken teeth into his gums as he

239
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:34,619
gurgles while his mouth is dripping blood. I don't want to listen to that. Can I light off?

240
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:48,469
Cut to power. Can I get up there? Would you like to play the founders now? Oh god, I don't know.

241
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:59,610
The central nervous gives you a version of reality that keeps it comfortable.

242
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:07,929
To exist is to have a body. To have a body is to have limited understanding.

243
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:16,329
Suddenly you find your consciousness far away from your flesh and your awareness drifting to

244
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:26,199
wherever and is very slowly blending with a universal laziness that shrouds all sentience.

245
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:38,280
Why did somebody say ASMR truck? It's not truck. That is not actual TOS. What? What are you talking

246
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:49,050
about? What do you mean? Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. What? What's

247
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,989
going on? What's going on? A break dancer with ice cream zits. An alien reggae band using

248
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:03,510
dismembered chimeras as instruments. Everyone's listening to radio stations from across earth

249
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,590
trying to make sense of humanity. The more they try to make sense the less sense there is.

250
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:17,349
The founders of Daytona Beach also founded Dayton, Ohio. Stock trading through Vedic ritual.

251
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:25,349
Decapitated heads telling sci-fi stories to walls. A green cowboy stuck inside a wooden temple.

252
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:34,619
I don't understand. Is it like something at the end? If you want your body back you need to

253
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:44,360
pronounce a seven syllable word three times. It is a vibration key to a corporate figure out your

254
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:53,500
work and you will return to a body. Seven syllable word. Supercalifragilisticexpial. That's

255
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:56,650
like 12. Never mind. I need a seven syllable word. No. I'm not going to do it twice. Whoa.

256
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:08,809
Isn't that thing just... Everybody always makes these horror game things and these scary monsters

257
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:15,289
and oh my god look out it's the lady with the long hair and the coat on or whatever and they

258
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,289
know if this thing's sprinting full speed down like an alley screaming

259
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,090
this will be way scarier than like the guy from Outlast.

260
00:43:45,590 --> 00:44:27,059
There's nobody dancing here. Is this a band song? All right if I do that joke again I want 100

261
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:33,639
people to unsubscribe. If I do that joke one more time I want 100 people to unsubscribe.

262
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:40,599
Ugh. Mouth? Oh it's an eye. Whatever it is. What did I just pick up?

263
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,079
Do I have to collect all the things? Is it going to bite me?

264
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:30,309
This is very strange. I guess this is weird. This is strange. Am I not tall enough to go over here?

265
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:42,460
What's that? R1. Do I have to press R1 on the controller? I like that. I like that little guy.

266
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,929
Now that's cool. I know what that feels like. You know when you just look at something I know it's

267
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:57,289
like a leather. It's like a nice smooth leathery feel. I know what that feels like. I want that.

268
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:01,929
I'm gonna feel that right now. I want to like raise my hand over that like soft like very smooth

269
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:41,539
leather. I'm losing 100 subs. Got my finger on the unsub button. Am I just talking to this thing?

270
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:51,269
Don't don't don't don't what do you mean don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't

338
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:47,880
real who's to say there is something about life to which is it even real or not all right that's

339
01:00:47,880 --> 01:01:00,539
close enough i don't think i have to deduct very many points i get like a 75 visiting secret lair

347
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:49,320
it was pretty weird it was all kind of out there you're forgetting the xd i know and whatever

348
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:02,460
that was called there is something to say about life and death to bring yourself to the

349
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,500
realization that it might not be real it's just type in there is something into steam and you'll

350
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,579
find it i think that's the only one that has that
