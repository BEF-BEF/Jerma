1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:13,140
Hey, what's up? Sorry, I'm a little late. I had to do my get ready thing I do in front of the mirror that all streamers do.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:23,670
If you don't know, after you get out of the shower and after you do your hair and you get some to eat, you have some water.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,210
I, like many others, go in front of the mirror and just point at myself and I go,

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,240
own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it for about 25 minutes. Really get myself pumped up for the day.

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:01:08,980
That would get in the way so much if you really had to do that. Just sitting there yelling,

6
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,069
own it to yourself in the mirror. But anyways, hi, how are you? Today we're going to play a game

7
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:26,870
about traveling through time. The game is called No Time. It's a game about driving around in a car.

8
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:34,569
That car has time travel capabilities. It is a car game. Just to let you know, this is a car game.

9
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:53,349
Could be very fun. Travel back to an hour ago when you weren't late. I think you can, I'm, all right.

10
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:59,109
From the description of this game, I think you can put in any date in modern human history.

11
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:12,620
As long as it's 1 AD. So I, maybe we can go forward. Go back to 23 years ago. Oh no.

12
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:29,270
The title sucks. It doesn't matter. You guys are still doing the 20, yeah.

13
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,770
You still on the 23 thing. I have a question. How many of you guys watched the movie yesterday?

14
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,039
You guys have had one full day in between the last stream. Anybody watch the movie?

15
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:58,219
I have to assume some of you have. Why would I do that? I don't know. I thought about it. I was

16
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:03,180
pretty close to, you know, is it on, can I get it on like Amazon or like iTunes or something?

17
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:16,520
What does this person say? I don't know. Whatever it was that got removed. I think they're asking

18
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,860
what the best VR headset is. It depends. Do you want to save some money to get one of the small

19
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,180
wireless ones? You know, or do you want to have the wire going into the back of your head and then,

20
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,969
yeah, I don't know. Have the index. I would say the index. The only problem is my index was kind

21
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:41,270
of screwed up. My left ear of my index just kind of stopped working randomly. So I don't know. I

22
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:56,340
don't think I can say that. Can't wait for 2023. How do we, how do we end that joke? Do you know

23
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,699
how unbearable 2023 is going to be on this channel? If we don't end that joke, we have to find an

24
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:17,500
exit for it. I can't wait till 2025. We got to come up with a new thing. We got to give you guys a

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:27,560
new number because otherwise next year is going to be hell. All right. You guys ready? Let's go. It

26
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,000
took me long enough. I do have to say this. I know a lot of people are going to, they're going to

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,040
pog sad in the chat when they hear this, but after this stream, streams are going to be a little

28
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,060
sporadic over the next couple of weeks. I've got a lot, I've got a lot of work to do. I've got a

29
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,750
lot of work to do, but seriously, I'm not going to be streaming this weekend. I'm not going to be

30
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,519
streaming. They're going to be all over the place. The green screen will happen in the next week.

31
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:13,860
I'm going to give you a hard date very soon within the next 10 days, but that June into July is

32
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,339
going to, it's probably something, it's probably going to be the busiest I've been

33
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:25,449
since 2021, a few months, two or three months before the dollhouse. There's a lot of stuff

34
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:32,889
going on. So don't worry. I'm not going, you'll see me. I'm not going away. I'm going to try to do

35
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:45,019
one or two streams a week until July, at least. So don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. What

36
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:52,810
happened? I was playing fallout. The streams are going to be sporadic. That's it, but not too,

37
00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:00,740
don't worry. It's not like I'm going to stream for like, don't worry. Since 2022, all through 2021,

38
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,889
I was kind of a once a week Andy. That's probably not going to happen. So don't worry. It's not like

39
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm going to go to once a week in the next month. Don't worry about that. They already are once a

40
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,500
week. No, no, I do like, I do like two or three times a week. I stream three times a week since

41
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:36,420
2022. I went back to the old pre Vegas schedule three times a week or so. I actually, the pre,

42
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,180
the first like year in Vegas, wasn't I streaming like four plus days a week?

43
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:54,660
You should stream two, oh, come on. Stop, stop it. Two to 23. Oh my God. I'm going to give you

44
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:03,000
another number. Six. Six. Isn't that number six? Cool. There's so many things that you can add up

45
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,370
to make six. Two plus two plus two is six. Seven minus one is six. Six times zero is zero. But

46
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,870
six, six, six, that's the devil number. Isn't that a, that's a crazy number, isn't it? That's

47
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,360
a scary number. You know what number I really don't like? The number six. Cause like six, six,

48
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,579
that's devil. I'm scared of the devil. No, don't meme that one. Don't, don't meme that one. Don't

49
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:46,459
do that. No, I fucking hate that. Did it work? All right, let's go. How you doing? What's up?

50
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:59,269
Uh, this is no time. Is it my camera? Just making sure. Nice evil hair. Yeah, it's all right.

51
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:09,779
All right, let's get it up. See what would have been really funny is if I had been in a back to

52
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:16,740
the future costume with goggles and a big lab coat. And before I turned the stream on my webcam,

53
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,779
I was like, Oh, here we go. And, Oh, we're going to go for it. We're going to find a future. We're

54
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,379
going to go back to the future. And it was, I was in a back to the future costume and that would be

55
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:33,399
funny. I think you guys would like that. All right, let's go. This is a driving game. Is this a

56
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:50,299
controller game? This is a car game. Maybe I should use a controller. Thanks for your disappointment.

57
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:55,450
That would be Richard Nixon. That was not, that was not Richard Nixon. I can't, you can't do.

58
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,820
All right, listen, this is important for all of you watching at home. If I do a doc impression,

59
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm doing a Rick impression. And you all hate that. I, nobody can ever do a doc impression ever

60
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,629
again. Cause you're just doing Rick from Rick and Morty. You understand? Like I would have tried to

61
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,769
go into it and really do it, but it would have been, uh, it would have been Rick. Let me try to

62
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:24,409
do a doc. Oh, Morty, we're going to be careful. Put that, get back in there and we're going to

63
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:35,960
go back in time to shave. Actually it is different. Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful. I don't know.

64
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,960
Guys, I've never seen all these movies. I've never seen them. I just know, I know Christopher,

65
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:48,679
Christopher Lloyd, right? His name's Morty, not Marty. Marty, not what? I just dropped everything.

66
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:55,139
All right. Stop. Let's go. All right. Let's play the core game. Play the official story

67
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:02,870
campaign of no time along with all side stories and secrets. Sure. Why not? You guys ready? Can

68
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:13,590
I drive? Sir Adam, the energy source of the future requires a fusion reactor. I gotta put my headphones

69
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:24,340
in to understand. PLC entry. Hello and welcome to no time. A lost in days experience. If you've got

70
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,139
a minute, I'd like to take you through the basics of the game. Why is there crash dummy stuff on

71
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,360
there? All right. Let's go tutorial. Double the, double the, double the, double the, double the

72
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:43,059
W A S D. Pretty good. And left alts to crouch. Is there a punch? Left alt is crouch. That's changing.

73
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:58,419
It actually got to come down to like 30. Crouch is left alt. We're going to make that C is compass.

74
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:08,389
Use is F. When did this change? Use was E for 50 years and they just, everybody collectively all

75
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:19,220
decided it was going to be F. Why? Please help me with this. What happened? E, E, E was for everything.

76
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,379
It was for use. It was for interaction. Now it's F. What everyone collectively at the same time said

77
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:31,779
that was a good idea. I don't, why? There has to be a reason, right? Because Q and E is for leaning.

78
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,610
Oh, that, whatever. That's all right. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to make this what I want.

79
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:46,360
So it's going to be E. Take is going to be F. Sandbox, that's fine. Full power mode G. Zoom,

80
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,840
X. Punch. There is punch. Holy shit. Okay. There's a throw. This game's already pretty much a nine

81
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:02,259
out of 10 so far. Crouch is going to be C. Compass is going to be control or tab. No, compass. Compass.

82
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:08,649
I don't know. Two, four. Compass is going to be four. I don't know why. Cause it's like four

83
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:14,600
directions. North, south, east, west. That makes sense to me. Zoom. That's fine. All right. I think

84
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,620
this is good. If I need to change it again. Car. W A S D. Space. Fly mode. Thrust up. Up arrow.

85
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,100
Time conductor. Cooling. Okay. What about ride? All right. I think we're good.

86
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:36,779
Pick up the uranium next to the car. Press E to pick it up. Uranium. Did you say E? Wait, what?

87
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,129
Now put the uranium onto the reactor. Didn't I say, wait, didn't I say E?

88
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:52,789
He said E. What's going on? Am I going crazy? No, seriously. I'm going crazy.

89
00:12:52,789 --> 00:13:04,730
After just saying that. What's going on? What? Oh, it is F. Okay. All right. Put the uranium

90
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,090
on top of the reactor chamber. Use number one to seven to scroll through your inventory

91
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:27,690
or mouse wheel. All right. So put it in. What? What? Okay. I have to eventually come back to 1984

92
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:38,809
day two at 000. Turn the volume up. I will. Okay. Now read the useful notes.

93
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:50,259
They should be on the front of your car. Oh, that's loud for me. All right. Useful notes.

94
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,570
Like fucking Jesus. Why can't I just, I want to grab it. Can I grab it? After you finish reading

95
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,450
the notes into the vehicle by using the steering wheel. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm on step.

96
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:14,019
What step am I on? Step one. Insert uranium sample into reaction. Okay. Step two. Get in the car.

97
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:24,250
We got one lamp in the test zone. Step three. Check the reactor temperature. All right. We've

98
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:43,450
got to get in the car. It's fucking dark in here. No, I need those notes. I don't know what to do.

99
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:51,460
And you can save and the game above. Oh, and if your reactor temperature is above 300 degrees

100
00:14:51,460 --> 00:15:00,570
Fahrenheit first. Okay. Cool. The nuclear. Oh, and you can look up the controls in the pause menu.

101
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,009
All right. So we can't go over 300 degrees. I have talked for long enough.

102
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:09,929
Good luck and have fun on your adventures in no time. Lost a day sandbox experience.

103
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:22,309
All right. Let's go. Drive. How do I drive? I need those notes. How do I get out of the car?

104
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:33,370
I need the notes that are on the top. Find an advanced source of energy for the reactor.

105
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:40,519
Estimations would be around 2014. I think or a little later. Okay. Uranium samples as temporary

106
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,610
power source are in the luggage space. Do not travel through time if the reactor is

107
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:55,509
temperature is above 300 degrees. Avoid yourself at all costs. Okay. I repeat. Avoid yourself.

108
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:03,019
What about the actual useful notes? Give me this. Step five. Talk with the time conduction and

109
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:12,549
enter the date into the timetable that order. All right. Step six. The travel sequence should start.

110
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,429
That's month, day, year, and then hmm. What is hmm?

111
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,759
Travel sequence should start at about 70 miles per hour. Okay, let's go.

112
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:36,440
Get in the fucking car. All right. Here we go. Let's time to set our destination.

113
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:49,669
We are going to go to type a date and time. Um, I don't, what am I pressing? Date a 12.

114
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:11,880
What did I just do? Type a date and confirm. I just shot me. What? What? I just explode.

115
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,480
I don't understand. What just happened? Why am I like fucking three feet tall?

116
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:37,259
What a terrible nightmare. Hello. Open up. Hello. Shut this off. What? What happened?

117
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:56,920
Oh, that's me doing that. Turn it down. Hello. Who is it? Finally. Have you been sleeping on

118
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:08,099
the floor again? You better had made some progress by now ever. But tell me you finished the reactor.

119
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,059
I did, but awesome. Come on now. There's a little, there's a little time. Our supervisor will show

120
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:20,980
up soon. We need the machine to be ready. Holy shit. This guy, the time machine. Come on now.

121
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:33,700
We got no time. All right. Grab the reactor and follow me to the elevator. All right. This is a

122
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:48,039
reactor. Drink that coffee. A stack of books. That's a reactor. Give it to me. Let's go.

123
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:04,019
Put your hand in the door. I dropped the reactor. Put your hand in the door. All right. Let's go.

124
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:11,180
Where are we going? I'm holding the reactor. You press the button to go to the lobby for the,

125
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,619
oh, give me a break. Why would I have to do this? I'm holding a fucking nuclear reactor or whatever

126
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:26,869
this is. I'll do it. I'm sorry. If somebody has one of these, they go and let this and they're

127
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:31,900
going to be a person in front, a person to each side and a person behind walking with them,

128
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,769
all moving step by step at the same time. And there's going to be somebody literally,

129
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,769
there's going to be something attached to their stomach, like a big umbrella underneath them.

130
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,170
So like if they drop it, it just goes right into like the big chute, like under like an umbrella.

131
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,390
There's no way somebody's holding it in their hands like this. All right. This is the,

132
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:04,259
this is it. Quest turn in. Edward looks proud. Wow. Mach three. Yep. I modified it to reach

133
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,450
speeds of up to 90 miles per hour and to also give you a nice clean shape, cleaner than a

134
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:16,410
single blade. Let's hope it will last longer than the Mach two. I heard that C Corp is working on

135
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:23,500
nuclear fueled cars. We're going to beat them to it. Oh, stop. Let's assemble the rest of the car

136
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,420
first. Hope your reactor works. Open the reactor hatch and insert it in the front of the car. All

137
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:48,759
right, let's go. Let's do it. Oh, got it. You didn't say I had to open the first car we had.

138
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,009
We didn't have to do that. All right. Now the time core is what makes time travel possible.

139
00:20:54,009 --> 00:21:02,180
It converts a frequency of time stream into an actual date and time. Where the fuck did you go?

140
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,880
How do I close this? Presently, you can only compute the dates in between roughly 4,000 BC

141
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,559
and 2030. But I'll figure out a way to mend it. The time frequency just oscillates. Though currently

142
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:26,519
you can only input dates after one AD anyway. Okay. All right. So what's the deal? He sounds

143
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:39,859
like Peter Griffin. Let's do a test run. Oh, fucking come on. I know, I know. I promise the

144
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:46,579
time displacement procedure will occur this time, even if you crash the car into the wall. I've had

145
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:51,779
nightmares ever since. I'm lucky to be alive. Or maybe the rest of the island, the accelerator

146
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:57,619
could have gotten destroyed in a nuclear blast due to the impact. Don't worry. I made the car

147
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,460
very sturdy. So the probability of a nuclear explosion. Yes, but first retrieve the personal

148
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:13,369
log computer, please. They're on the table. Yeah, it's like if Peter Griffin was an undertale.

149
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:31,980
I know what you mean. All right. Dress in the hazmat suit. Should I be in this? What is this

150
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:49,130
thing? What am I looking at here? Okay, I got it. Oh, no. What do you want me to do? Did you say

151
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:59,099
there was notes or something? What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? You say there

152
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:06,220
was something on the table? This is what it was on the table? What do you want me to do?

153
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:21,910
I don't remember. What do you want me to do? A computer. Okay, thanks. It's the the Pip Boy.

154
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:31,109
Okay. Prologue. Edward gave me his newest PLC, a few bug fixes, and so on. Let's talk to Edward.

155
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:40,759
Oh, this music. Isn't it great? It works. Made a few bug fixes and cleanups. Hope it'll help

156
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:50,309
you with your work in the future. Looking cool. Thanks, Ed. This game is random. Can you strap it

157
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,549
on my arm? This thing weighs like three kilos. I don't think you want that kind of strain on

158
00:23:54,549 --> 00:24:01,660
your wrist. Anyways, you see I'm strapped. I'm not suffocating, right? Am I just suffocating in a suit?

159
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:09,960
Okay, what do you want me to do? I've strapped a meter on the right side of the PLC. It tells

160
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,380
you whenever a temporal shift occurs. Remember our little theory session? This shift happens

161
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,660
when your activity in space time reaches a certain threshold. Time itself morphs around your actions,

162
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,779
wiping your past selves, since you or anything you left in that time weren't meant to be there.

163
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:42,700
Oh, of course. It's the grandpa paradox. I think. The grandpa paradox is if you go back in time

164
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,700
before you were born, you technically weren't born, so therefore your grandfather had to have

165
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,140
been alive first for you to be alive, so therefore you can't exist in that time frame. Let's go to

166
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:03,240
the grandpa paradox. It's something like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's if you go back

167
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,420
in time and kill your grandfather, then you can't exist, so you disappear and you fade out,

168
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:28,140
like in the movies. Why would you do that? I don't know. Oh, yeah, I got a time machine.

169
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,940
The first thing I'm going to do. Oh, man, I could go see anything in human history. I could go

170
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,539
forward. I could see what the world looks like. I could see what happened back when the dinosaurs.

171
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:42,819
No, I think I was going to go kill my grandfather and disappear. What? Well, yeah, why would I do

172
00:25:42,819 --> 00:26:08,230
that? Why would I do that? That's a Chad move. No, it's not. Okay. Giga Chad goes back in time

173
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:17,660
to kill his grandfather. If you drop something sometime in the past, it would vanish. This is

174
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,460
the grandpa paradox, right? Bigger changes would probably... Oh, no, the grandpa paradox is if you

175
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,220
go swat a mosquito on your arm, then your grandfather never meets your grandmother because

176
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,700
everything can change, possibly. And then when you go forward in time, you look out the window

177
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,140
and it's raining donuts and you wish you would have stayed in that timeline, but you got really

178
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,420
freaked out. It's something that happened at the family dinner table, so you left before it started

179
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:53,349
raining the donuts. I understand. I understand. It's a fucking Simpsons episode. You say I'm the

180
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:57,750
one that's not a cultured media viewer. That happened in The Simpsons and all you question

181
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,349
marking me and everyone says Simpsons is the best fucking TV show ever made. And that was back when

182
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:06,710
The Simpsons were in the first 10 years of its existence, not the last 20 years of its existence.

183
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,390
To me, the last 20 years of The Simpsons existence has been like an iPad ad for like a mobile game

184
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,750
from like trailer. That's the same thing for me. The last like 10 to 15 years of The Simpsons

185
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,720
has been like an iPad trailer. I just like, I skip it. I don't want to watch this. What were we

186
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,599
doing? I don't know. Leave me alone. I'm fucking relaxing. You need to fix the fragmentation. I'm

187
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:36,700
just sitting here like breathing in my own like carbon dioxide. What's? All right. I said I was

188
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,740
going to chill out today and that's happening. So stop fucking saying the number 23 or you're

189
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,700
going to be fucking banned. Back to it. You need to fix the fragmentation of time for me.

190
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,400
So during some tests of the core, I ended up making rifts in the time space continuum. I sent

191
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,200
boxes with items through time, but they came back empty with strange letters inside them.

192
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,130
Just keep that in mind. Don't lose sight of your boxes while time traveling. I should make a box

193
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:13,529
that's a mailbox and like I put it in one place and if you put stuff into it, it goes back and

194
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,930
forward in time. And then I could have a pen pal who communicate with somebody from a different

195
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:34,299
time period. That'd be cool. Somebody said play the fucking game. I had to be honest. I'm very

196
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:41,740
confused. I am playing the game. This is a lot of dialogue. Okay, let's go. No time for that.

197
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,660
Drive the car into the acceleration tunnel. Move the car to the starting position. Then wait for

198
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,660
my signal. When I open the gates, the mod chip, which I inserted earlier, will send you exactly

199
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,460
one hour into the future. Make sure to remove the chip afterwards. It blocks the time input. Okay.

200
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:13,299
Okay. All right. Let's go. Yeah. One. Why one hour? Okay. So he said it already.

201
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:21,769
Did you set it already? Did you turn it on?

202
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:49,779
Save the game. All right. That's good. Save it right here. The save system's not turning on.

203
00:29:50,420 --> 00:30:15,000
Can I help you? All right. Let's go. Turn it on. Is it on? Okay. Here we go. Oh fuck.

204
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,420
You need to put the uranium in. Didn't I already do that? It's in it. It's right there.

205
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:36,359
Didn't I already do that? I already did that, didn't I? Oh, it's okay. I didn't know it was

206
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:47,210
the second thing. All right. Let's go. Here we go. So get to the starting point, which is where we're

207
00:30:47,210 --> 00:31:05,799
here. I'm imagining this is probably the starting point. You're going to open the door. All right.

208
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:16,089
Let's go. Everything seems to be active. Activate them. I think they're active. Reactor. On.

209
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:34,069
Accelerate to 70 miles per hour. Time conductor. On. Get ready. Let's go.

210
00:31:34,309 --> 00:32:02,890
Oh, I suspect located. You're coming with us. I got one. I got one. What do we do?

211
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:11,019
Drive the car down the secret door. I can't fucking see anything with this stupid suit on.

212
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:22,180
You just skipped over that hour and here you are. Incredible. Are you all right? Like,

213
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,019
do you feel weird in any way? Don't worry about the guys back there. I'll be explained in due time.

214
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:31,460
Do you want a gun? What is this place? Yes. My personal invention. A stun gun to be precise.

215
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:38,039
The first prototype that works. Open this place. This is my secret hideout. I installed a secret

216
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:45,180
door, entrance and so on. I knew it would come in handy someday. Is it even legal? I don't know.

217
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,920
What's going on here? Do you want the short version or the long version? Whatever. Agents,

218
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,160
they broke into the facility and are raiding all our research. We need to get the machine out of

219
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,109
here. They call them that on the news. C Corp has made no comments on whether they got attacked too.

220
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,910
How do we get the machine out unnoticed? Unnoticed? Not possible. I know how to give

221
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,910
you enough time before they catch up though. This room leads to the drainage tunnels of the facility.

222
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:19,589
From there you can move on the main road which leads to Pine Island. Just go as far away as

223
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:24,549
possible. Jump some time into the future just till things cool off. We'll meet each other somehow.

224
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,720
What about you? Someone needs to distract them from you and our invention. Don't sweat it. I'll

225
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,880
make it out. This is only one of many hideouts. Someone needs to hold the flood gates open for

226
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,869
you and I have my stun gun. Don't worry. We'll see each other on the other side. Outside you'll need

227
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:52,339
to open the first gate. There's no time. Hurry. Open it. Let's go. Let's go. Give me out. Give

228
00:33:52,339 --> 00:34:08,659
me up. Don't worry. I know a way out. All right. Open it. Let's go. Good luck. I need to put a new

229
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:19,500
date in, right? Reactor is on. Okay. Put a new date in. Type in a date. Month? What is it? What's

230
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:30,469
April? April four? Oh four? Dude, what am I looking at here? What is going on? No, I don't

231
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:53,769
understand. Cool it off. Cool it off. Cool it off. How do I actually do this? What the fuck? Set

232
00:34:53,769 --> 00:35:08,619
destination. Four one one two. How do I actually use this thing? Time target. Present departure.

233
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:21,079
How do I? I can't. How do I punch this in? 41 o'clock. I don't want to actually go to

234
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:29,139
this time period. It literally set. Yeah, but I can't. I don't know. There's one, two, three,

235
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:36,099
four, five, six slots. How am I supposed to know which one I'm doing? Okay. When I just typed it

236
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:43,239
in, it did this one, this one, then this. It like jumped around because this is the present day.

237
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:54,650
Set departure time. Type in a date. Okay. Like month first. 04 is April, right? Why is it not

238
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:05,849
working? I'm just fucking driving. It's the letters. What are you talking about? Letters for

239
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:23,139
month. APR. No, the guys, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Nothing works. APR is April. Yeah,

240
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:37,159
but I can't. I don't understand. I can't change it. It doesn't make any sense. Type a date and

241
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:49,989
confirm with enter. Okay, let's try this again. I need to remove the override chip. All right,

242
00:36:49,989 --> 00:37:26,860
let's take it out. How do I get the fuck out of here? Okay, let me try this again. Time target.

243
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:38,360
All right, the reactor's off. Everything's good. Should I travel now? Do I have to go 70? Get the

244
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:52,789
chip out. Hold on. Dude, can I? How do I rip the fucking chip out of the thing?

245
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:19,480
Give it to me. All right, let's go. Okay, I made it out. Quest complete. Don't pull that up while

246
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:32,710
you're driving. Okay, sounds good. Oh, that was just scripted. I just, okay, I get it.

247
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:57,610
This is not an ending, right? In the heat of the takeover, planned by his group, one of the

248
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:07,480
inventors managed to... No, okay, I got it. I shouldn't even been touching anything. This was

249
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:15,619
all the scripted first, like, 20 minutes of the game. Everybody, like, wants me to go back to,

250
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:21,289
like, fucking 100 AD, but, like, I can't even do that. Now I have access to this stuff.

251
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:47,619
Take this off. It's gonna give me a fucking headache. Okay, so I made it out. Now let's get

252
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:56,260
in here. Get that thing out of here. Do I have a trunk or anything? I can put this stuff in. I

253
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:06,090
feel like it's gonna fall out. Okay, save the game. The autosave cannot be overwritten within this one.

254
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:22,329
One. All right, cool. So we are currently April 15th, 1984. 13. Parture. What does that mean?

255
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:32,679
Well, where should I go? Set date. Type a date and time. Okay, so I'm gonna type in...

256
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:42,250
Should it date some month first? Which would be 04, right? Okay, yeah, it is 04, not APR.

257
00:40:42,889 --> 00:41:00,300
So let's do 04. 14. Let's go yesterday. 1984. And then we're gonna do it at 10 o'clock. We're

258
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,230
gonna go to yesterday. That's exciting. I'm just testing to see if the machine works.

259
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:14,650
I'm... Guys, know what? Fuck that. If you had access to a time machine, you are going to just

260
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:20,730
go back a day or so, man. Like, this... I'm not going back a thousand years. What if I... What if

261
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:28,789
I get stuck? What if I get stuck? I need to test to make sure it works. Let's go for it. You ready?

262
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Let's go! What's happening? What's happening? I didn't hit enter. Yeah, it did.

263
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:14,059
Oh my... 04. 14. 1984. 10 o'clock. Enter. Reactor. Let's go. I don't have any uranium left?

264
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:28,739
Shit! I need to put the chip back in? Where is it? Where's the chip? Oh, fuck. I thought I had to

265
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:43,110
take the chip out because that was like the safety protocol. Oh dear god, where the fuck is it?

266
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:50,280
Where is it? I don't think I need to do that, guys. It wasn't part of the game that I take

267
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:59,190
the chip out. No, it's not relevant. It's not. So do I have... Am I out of reactor fluid? How can I

268
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:31,400
tell? Is there a way to tell? Okay. Why am I moving? Why am I moving? What's going on? Why... The car is

269
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:44,150
moving on its own. I mean, I'm driving it now, but that was weird. Why was it doing that? I will need

270
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:50,150
to... Okay. I always wanted to visit the distant future of 2014. Okay. Remove that mod chip.

271
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,920
Afterwards, I can input the destination if the time conduction is active and confirm it with enter.

272
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:20,739
Do I have to go to 2014? Is it just scripted? It said to get some snacks first. There's a donut

273
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:32,119
shop right here. I don't have any fuel. Where was that donut shop? Back there, right? Yeah. It said

274
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:48,179
get snacks because I have like a hunger meter. Uranium is at zero percent. Oh, okay. That makes

275
00:44:48,179 --> 00:45:07,289
sense. So I should have one more uranium pod or do I have to actually go find one? All right,

276
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:22,630
let's get out of here. I have no money to best donuts. I don't have any money. Can I just take

277
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:43,159
them? Sell the car. All right. So what does the quest want me to... What does it say? Go first.

278
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:51,449
Buy some snacks. I don't have any money. Where am I supposed to get... You're telling me to buy snacks,

279
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:59,500
but you're not telling me where I get money. I have zero dollars. Do I have something in the trunk?

280
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:17,590
What the fuck? Why there's so much... There's so much back there. You don't have your hazmat suit on.

281
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:27,320
I don't care. I don't give a shit. No, that's wrong. Somebody pulls up. Hey, can I give you a hand,

282
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:53,800
stranger? Yeah. Come in here. Can you hold this? All right. We got a hundred percent uranium. I'm

283
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:04,360
ready. I'm ready to go. Okay. We've got uranium. I'm going to April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock

284
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:33,050
at the morning. I'm just... I want to see if it works. Here we go. All right. All right. I'm back.

285
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:46,170
It is currently April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock. Look at... Everyone's... Don't be alarmed.

286
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:10,329
You'll be talking about this for centuries, motherfuckers. This would be the number one

287
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:16,650
article on top of every webpage. You know what's... Yeah. I got out and I punched that guy. Yep.

288
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:28,860
You know what's funny though? That guy will be on every... That guy will be interviewed for every

289
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:38,869
major news outlet. I've probably made that guy fucking at least $100,000. That guy's going to

290
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:44,019
write a book and everyone will buy it because you're the guy that the time traveler interacted

291
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:58,500
with. Oh, fuck. I'm going to be... Turn it off. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right.

292
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:13,800
I almost just fucking exploded in like a nuclear reaction. Can I do anything? Don't cut off the

293
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,659
time traveler. That's a big mistake. There's got to be like a quest I can do, right? I'm back

294
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:31,579
a day ago. Should I go back to the facility? I want to go back to the facility. It's been...

295
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:43,130
I'm going back to where I started. Back here. Wait a minute. This is literally a donut shop

296
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:57,190
tomorrow, right? Because there's a bridge. All right. I want to go see what's going on at the

297
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:03,190
facility. Your quest was for 2014. Yeah. But I wanted to... And now I understand how it works.

298
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:09,690
I'm not going to fucking finagle around and flop around like an idiot. Oh, there's the donut place.

299
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:25,820
It still sent you... No, it didn't. It didn't send me there. It's 1984. 1047. Close the door.

300
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:39,739
Close the car door, please. Because I want to see if he's there. There's money in your trunk. All

301
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:48,090
right. I'm very interested now. Now I get it. I understand how the game works. Don't worry. We're

302
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:59,590
good. Relax. We've got plenty of time. The reactor's off. I wish I could close this door.

303
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:30,789
Am I going to be in here? It's literally 1984. Go to 420-1969. What do I do? Just get out,

304
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,190
walk around and wheeze laughing and get in the car and leave.

305
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:48,489
There might be a material in here. All right. So there it is. It's not on fire. Can I just go in

306
00:51:48,489 --> 00:52:14,139
the front door? Find yourself in the past and kill them. All right. Well, here's the front door.

307
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:27,719
I wonder if I can open this. All right. If I'm looking at the security camera right now,

308
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:34,550
then it's me in this car trying to get in the door. Jerma, I miss when you played games that

309
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:38,150
had substance. Now you just play dog shit fart simulator games that are made for the purpose

310
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,469
of being a meaningless, shallow novelty to fill up your... Dude, I don't know where you've been for

311
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:47,349
12 years, but this is like the thing that I do. This is literally what I've been doing for like

312
00:52:47,349 --> 00:53:00,980
the last 12 fucking years. What was that person on about? My like fifth video I ever made on

313
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:14,710
YouTube was Insane Aquarium. What are you, you're supposed to crack? All right. So I don't think I

314
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,500
can get in. I'm going to go in the trunk though because now I can... Let me try something else.

315
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:40,789
It's a grandpa video. There's 50 bucks in here. All right. So I'm going to take this out. These

316
00:53:40,789 --> 00:54:00,199
things are finite. I got to be really careful with this. Go to 2012? Let's go somewhere fucking weird.

317
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,869
Right? I'll buy food later. I got to be careful. I'm going to run out of stuff. All right. I'm going

318
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:11,989
to go to 2014 because that's the quest and I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to soft lock

319
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:26,900
myself. So here we go. Let's just go to like, I don't know, July, July 4th, 2014. I guess. I don't

320
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:35,380
know. Was it, was it June? It's not. All right. And then I don't know like 10 a.m. July 4th. I don't

321
00:54:35,380 --> 00:55:00,119
know. Let me get a good straightaway. Let's go. I'm ready. We're going to do the quest and then

322
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:21,349
after that I'm going to the dinosaurs. All right. So I, I went into the future. It's July, it's 2014.

323
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:44,039
Oh, okay. What's going on? Stop moving. Okay. So now what do I do? I always wanted to visit the

324
00:55:44,039 --> 00:56:06,980
distant 2014. Okay. Just have to lay low. This looks kind of the same. This looks like this looks

325
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:18,119
identical. Nothing changed. What did I do? What? Wait, what happened? Why did I just time travel

326
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,719
to the same spot at the same exact time? Wouldn't I have just crashed into myself and we both would

327
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:36,309
have died? Oh my god. I wasted a fucking reactor. I only have two more of these. I'm going to,

328
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,599
that I did. I, why was, how would that have been a bit? I, I thought I was going to, what happened?

329
00:56:52,519 --> 00:57:26,579
July, enter, right? Okay. Let's go for it. My trunk? What? What's wrong with the trunk?

330
00:57:29,590 --> 00:58:02,599
What? Don't scare me like that. Seriously. What the hell? Let's go. July 4th, 2014. It is 10 AM.

331
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:21,019
Okay. I kind of, okay. I would, this is what I would do if I had a time machine.

332
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:28,969
Okay. If I had a time machine and I had unlimited uses on the time machine,

333
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,119
I would go into this donut shop, right? And I would go there and I'd be like, how are you? How

334
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:45,610
are you? Good to see you. And I would be like, and check that out. Bring it back. I'd say something

335
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,690
really like odd, just specific. And I would hand the money and I would leave. And then I would come

336
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:55,960
back like five years later and I would do the same exact thing. I would just be a fucking customer

337
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,480
at that point. Who cares? That person wouldn't even remember that you were there. They wouldn't

338
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,119
give a shit at all. You would just be a customer coming in again, like after five years. Why would

339
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:10,250
I time travel to do that? That would be stupid. They would have forgotten that you came in and

340
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,769
it would have been like, Oh, that guy was kind of weird. I met, that guy maybe was in the area.

341
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:20,940
Maybe he doesn't live here. That would be fucking dumb. Nevermind. Okay. I want donuts, chocolate

342
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:36,739
donuts. Oh, thanks. Can I pick them up? What will be friend? I make the best donuts. You know, this

343
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,820
would be a cool indicator to see if you went to a place and you went back in time, five years and

344
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:47,909
forward in time, five years, did the donuts taste the same or did the, um, go bring that donut back.

345
00:59:48,469 --> 01:00:18,039
What time is it? July 4th, 2014 at 10 28. Come back and eat it again. All right. Well,

346
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:25,269
there's a new quest here. The future. I wonder what new inventions I will find here. Maybe I

347
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:29,670
can find some familiar faces. I should take a look at the town square. I remember Edward saying he

348
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:38,539
wanted to open an inventor shop somewhere. All right. Town square. Go back and stop yourself

349
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:48,940
from eating the donut because they changed the recipe and it's not as good. That's a cartoon.

350
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,739
I don't want to do it because I don't want to run out of material. I can travel one more time.

351
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:59,820
And you know, the joke where if you got three wishes, oh, I know what I would do. I have this

352
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,619
crazy elaborate plans for each one. I just had five wishes. I'm down to one. I haven't done it.

353
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:12,699
Fucking anything. So I'm full of shit. You know, I, I, what have we done? I've accidentally went to

354
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:27,219
the same place twice. I wanted to eat a donut again. What is this? What the fuck is that? What

355
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:42,809
is that? What is that? Why is this here? Does it drink that? Why the giant radioactive crabs in

356
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:58,519
2014? Who's doing that? What the fuck is this? Is nobody else seeing this? Is nobody else seeing

357
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:13,260
the giant crab that's attacking me? Hello. Wow. It's the future. Uh, okay. Wow. The future. Bye.

358
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:25,690
Where's the watch? Get that thing out of here. Oh, I gotta go. I don't like that.

359
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:33,559
I really don't like that thing. All right. I'm looking for a technology center.

360
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:53,670
I'm gonna get out of it. You have a quest. What is it? Any rumors? I've recently read about the

361
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:59,429
bank robbery in the 1870s in a document in Pine Lakes archives. It's worth a read. It's what

362
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:04,230
led Westwood into defeating 20 bandits single-handed. You remember the story. 1870s.

363
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:42,170
Okay. Eight. Somebody write that down. What just happened? That's two bucks. What can I get you?

364
01:03:42,170 --> 01:04:03,079
You don't have anything to buy. You don't have any products. All right. I'm technically not

365
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:12,659
going to steal it. I'm going to throw it out the outside. How much is this? I would like to buy

366
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:27,860
this please. And what is this? Turns organic material into fuel. I only have $47. Box. This

367
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:33,530
box fits a small amount of items. I probably should get the flashlight, right? Yeah. I'll take a

368
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:49,510
flashlight. Oh my god. And a radio. What's in your favorite radio stations? No, I don't want that.

369
01:04:49,510 --> 01:05:06,860
I'll take another reactor. Okay. This is what I would like to buy. Thank you. Can I take this?

370
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:18,199
I can take this out now, right? You're not gonna get pissed? I have 10 bucks left. Do other people

371
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:40,090
have time machines? Get the radio. I don't want the radio. I don't have enough money. Okay. Do I

372
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:54,949
have to hold it in front of my face? I have to... Who holds it like this? Can I not just put it on

373
01:05:54,949 --> 01:06:10,380
my... Okay. All right. There we go. There we go. There we go. Put this in the trunk too. All right.

374
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:22,150
I gotta keep looking around because there's apparently a technology thing somewhere. Wait.

375
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:35,000
Is this it? Build the second mechanic. I'd like to modify my car. Can you repair my car? Park it in

376
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,980
the garage and then I'll take a look at it. All right. This thing's probably beat up. How much

377
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:53,340
health does it have? Can I tell? What are you doing? Why are you dumb? Turn the flashlight off?

378
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:16,539
Why do you care about the flashlight being on? There's no battery in the flashlight, dude.

379
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:35,349
What are you talking about? All right. What if I put my destination to 10 seconds ago so that

380
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:44,070
my car pulls up and then there's a huge flash and another one of my cars pulls up? What would he do?

381
01:07:44,070 --> 01:08:18,039
What would he do? Okay. This thing's fixed. I want to go to the 1870s. Get out of the way.

382
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:20,600
All right. I need to... Let me do this quest part. I'm looking for...

383
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:32,390
This is the town square, I'm assuming. All right. Can I fast forward like one minute to when I...

384
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:44,069
After I did that jump because I'm gonna do it. Job requests? Oh, okay. Here's a new location.

385
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:58,789
There was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during the 1870s. Maybe I'll get some money. All right.

386
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:21,020
Where am I? Money drop head? Okay. This is definitely the town square. What else was in

387
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:43,590
there? Oh, nice. A sandwich. Sheriff Westwood. Deeds of Sheriff Pine Lake. Okay. So the first

388
01:09:43,590 --> 01:10:06,619
quest is to go back. Oh, where is it? Hello. Welcome to my workshop. I am E.R. Aether Inventor.

389
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:17,140
Are you here for a scientific con... Oh, it's him. It's um... It's the guy. Hey. Wait a minute.

390
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:23,050
You look rather familiar. Have we met before? Never mind that now. I'm in the middle of something

391
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:29,449
big. Hey, is this something I've got to... We'll have plenty of time to talk later. I'm afraid this

392
01:10:29,449 --> 01:10:34,810
takes precedence. Okay. I'm building an atmospheric motivator. A device that transfuses the very

393
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:40,810
particles of high and low temperatures at will. English professor. I'm building a weather machine

394
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:48,979
and all I need is a couple of items to help with its assembly. What do you need? Okay. Here. Take

395
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:53,300
it. Copy it into your personal log. It shouldn't be too hard. There are only a few more things I

396
01:10:53,300 --> 01:11:02,460
need. Magnetometer? It's a di... Device which meters magnets, of course. It's obvious. Besides,

397
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:07,579
it's the MacGuffin. For most inventions these days, there should be some down the road at 612.

398
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,229
That they're pretty pricey. I suggest that you get it from Burns Scientific Store at Bridgetown.

399
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:16,250
Bridgetown.

400
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,930
The northern end of Cape Dun, a town located on top of a bridge, quite literally.

401
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,890
Sea Corp is behind that monstrosity to copy St.

402
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:31,529
Andry, that ugly megacity just on the other side of the coast. Anyway,

403
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:36,250
his shop is located on the top floor at the back. Okay, so we gotta go. We gotta go to

404
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:50,069
northern end of Cape Dun. Take a hover train to Bridgetown. I have a time machine. Okay.

405
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,380
Uranium is perfectly safe. Well, almost perfectly safe since ever since the

406
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:07,239
prismic ceiling glass was invented in 1992. Ten times stronger than lead. Okay. I need something

407
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:18,819
that can conduct enough gigawatts to power the machine. Okay. A what? He's thinking.

408
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:32,729
Too much lore? I think it's just enough lore. Okay. What could do the job?

409
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:38,729
Unless you someone get back my family heirloom pocket watch. Did I? Could I have gotten it back

410
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:48,729
when I wasted a time travel device? Okay. One of the first settlers had a pocket watch of set

411
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:53,369
quality. Let's just go to one, right? Let's just do it. I'm gonna go. Look, I could buy. I got,

412
01:12:53,369 --> 01:13:00,949
I got a, I got a limited amount of money. I got, I could, I could go. I could do the quest later.

413
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:15,189
Let's go meet Jesus. Okay. Back then, the Park Hill was our estate and he lived just next to it.

414
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:29,079
He never told me this story. I did just now. All right. Okay. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. Like

415
01:13:29,079 --> 01:14:12,470
you never seen a fucking time travel machine before. Car flipper. Do I have a map? Okay. Am I

416
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:34,859
flying? My car can't do that. That's not fair. That's bullshit. I I'm from the past, man. I don't

417
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:59,979
understand this stuff. Why am I stuck? Yes, it can. I'm actually stuck. Use the car flipper.

418
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:10,979
I'm going to fall off again. Go out the other door. What the fuck have I done? I'm going to fall off

419
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:18,380
again. And this time I'm probably going to die. I think I can get out eventually. I'm just loading

420
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:38,359
the game. Here. Here's real time travel for you. I'm loading this save file. Done. Okay. Let's load

421
01:15:38,359 --> 01:16:11,270
up the car. I'm not going to use it. I just want to make sure it's in there. Okay. Let's go. What

422
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:17,140
are you guys doing? Stop. So should I go? I got to go to the northern end of this area.

423
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:27,180
There's there's three. There's two or three quests. I can go get the stuff for that guy.

424
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:40,739
What is that? Okay. His heirloom brass clock from 1795. Uranium from 612.

425
01:16:42,250 --> 01:17:10,619
Or the. Okay. Let's go. Let's go to 1795. Go to year one. You said one. Let's go. Fine.

426
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:19,050
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

427
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:33,100
Come on. Come on. Come on. Where are my headlights?

428
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:15,670
Whatever. Shut up. I just got a little startled. Where's Jesus? Jesus. Jesus. I have a lot of

429
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:40,010
important stuff to tell you. Can I get lost? I can't see anything. Where's the snow in 1 AD?

430
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,100
Don't you feel like that all this stuff shouldn't be here? I know that's not that far away, but it

431
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:49,449
kind of feels like it should be, right? I feel like there wasn't grass. Think about that, right? I feel

432
01:18:49,449 --> 01:19:01,369
like there wasn't grass in like 600 million BC. Isn't that weird to think about? I'll drive around

433
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:16,890
for a minute. NA education. No, I know that it exists. I'm just saying it's weird to think about.

434
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:27,050
I keep taking this fucking thing out and I'm an idiot. I'm going to start holding on to these

435
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:35,619
because if I go back in time, maybe it'll be Phil again. All right. I'm going to drive around for

436
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:43,350
a little bit. Do I have my, where are my headlights? Okay. They're on. Are they on? I can't, I really

437
01:19:43,350 --> 01:20:44,939
can't tell. I wear my headlights. There we go. I guess it's really not that interesting. What's,

438
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:54,149
what would be so interesting here? It's just outside. That's it. I don't know what everyone

439
01:20:54,149 --> 01:21:07,460
was expecting. It's just outside. Even if there were dinosaurs or even if there were other animals,

440
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:14,949
it'd probably be pretty hard to find them. Even right now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's

441
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:31,239
a structure here. What's going on? What is this? Okay. If you, if I, if you walked into the woods

442
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:39,609
right now and your goal was I'm going to find a bear, you probably wouldn't. Like what are you

443
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:45,020
talking about? That's, that's just not going to happen. They could, they could, there's so much

444
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:59,100
surface area. They could be anywhere. They could be anywhere. It would take like hours potentially

445
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:06,180
to find one. At least an hour, which I'm not giving them more than an hour to look for a dinosaur.

446
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:19,210
Airbag just fucking hits me in the face. I'm just unconscious.

447
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:32,140
How would this change the course of human history? Because there's nuclear shit in here. Somebody

448
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:47,819
would find this and I would change the complete course of all history. 120 FOV Andy. What's wrong

449
01:22:47,819 --> 01:23:38,659
with that? Is this water? I thought this was slate. Let's go to like 9999. No, not that's too easy.

450
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:59,399
Let's go somewhere weird. I don't want to go to one and then 9999. Okay. I'll go to 2323. That

451
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:12,520
sounds fun. And I just said to not do that number of whatever. We're here. Okay. Here we go. Okay.

452
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:41,460
Let's go to 1225 Christmas at, I don't know, somewhere in like the evening. Let's go.

453
01:24:54,340 --> 01:25:24,199
My FOV is not 120. It's 90. Oops. Oh no. Civilization. What happened? No, this is a bad,

454
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:37,140
this is not a good Christmas. 25. Wait, what? This thing bugged. I don't, the difference between

455
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:57,140
one AD and 25 AD is not that long. I didn't type it in wrong. What? What happened? I did not type

456
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:22,550
that in wrong. Was it a typo? It's set for December 25th, 1225. The maximum is 2030. Oh, that's right.

457
01:26:25,369 --> 01:26:46,300
So what did I just say? I just nuked the earth. Oh, this sucks. Christmas doesn't exist in 2525.

458
01:26:46,300 --> 01:27:02,060
Whatever. I didn't cool it off. Oh, whatever. Civilization didn't exist anymore. All right. I

459
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:08,789
want to go, I'm going to, okay, I'm going to put it all my favorite numbers. You ready? What are some

460
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:23,420
of my favorite numbers? Okay. I like, I like 10. I also like, I like seven and then think of a few

461
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:29,609
digits. What's some of my favorite numbers? I like the number 10. No, I like the number five.

462
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:53,750
I like five. I also like three. I also like seven. No, I like seven. Okay. I also like the number 10.

463
01:27:53,750 --> 01:28:33,560
I also like the number five. Let's go. Okay. Where are we at? 540, like year 537.

464
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:44,250
Holy shit, that's always really loud. I just, whatever. This is the middle ages.

465
01:28:44,970 --> 01:29:05,300
So this is probably like a town, right? Try just look for a town. I'm going to find a settlement.

466
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:11,659
I'm going to run around screaming. You'll never be the same. You'll never be the same. None of you

467
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:20,920
will ever be the same. I'm going to go like this with a lighter. Then I'm going to show my phone

468
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:57,369
to everybody. I'm going to go like this and I'm going to leave. Settlement? No. Oh, the world was

469
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:15,529
really boring before fucking Twitter, huh? This is in the middle of nowhere in Arizona. Check your

470
01:30:15,529 --> 01:30:38,789
world map. Do I have a world map? M? World map. Ancient ruins? Guys, this ancient ruins. How do I

471
01:30:38,789 --> 01:30:54,859
get here? Oh my God. All right. Fuck everything else. We're going to the ancient ruins. Shit.

472
01:30:54,859 --> 01:31:04,220
All right. So I got to turn around and go this way. So just turn the car completely around,

473
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:29,220
just drive this way. All right. This is cool. I'm very excited now. Let's go. Maybe I'll run

474
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:53,369
into some people. Don't drive into the lake. I'm not going to drive into the lake. Not again. All

475
01:31:53,369 --> 01:32:02,810
right. Don't go a hundred miles per hour. Being stupid. All right. This pine lake, old forest.

476
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:10,359
Where are the, wait, when the ruins? What happened to the ancient ruins? They're gone. There's no

477
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:21,060
ancient ruins anymore. Lower your FOV. It's not that high. It's literally 90. What do you want it

478
01:32:21,300 --> 01:33:13,779
at? It's the first ever McDonald's. What actually is this? This is a tree? Why is there a tree made

479
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:32,060
out of weird like banana leaves? What is this? Should I take a sample or something? That's kind

480
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:51,609
of weird. This is tar? Were there really tar pits like this at five, six hundred A.D.? I don't know

481
01:33:51,609 --> 01:34:05,399
why, but like a big tar pit to me sounds like it should be long, long time ago. Something right

482
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:20,170
here. What the fuck? There was just like a settlement. All right. Where are those ruins?

483
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:29,220
There's the lake, old forest. Let's go to the old forest. Why don't just please go to A.D. 69.

484
01:34:29,220 --> 01:35:15,640
I'm thinking about it. All right. Old forest. I think I'm there. Yeah. Ancient ruins. Stop. Oh

485
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:49,050
my God. I think I'm going to get on foot. So don't smash up the car. It says they were here.

486
01:35:49,050 --> 01:36:27,510
What's that? There's an animal. Any supplies or anything? They don't have, where's anything?

487
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:44,409
Wait, now travel from here. Oh, wait a minute. Dude, if I travel right here and I go either back

488
01:36:44,409 --> 01:36:56,149
or forward, this is kind of, this is cool. I'm actually into this. All right. Let's go. Let's

489
01:36:56,149 --> 01:37:05,640
go forward. What? A couple hundred years or go backwards a hundred years. Is this the ancient

490
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:13,619
site? I would imagine it is, right? Kind of has to be. It says it's like here. Yeah. These are ancient

491
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:18,710
ruins, which means like two or three hundred years ago. Let's do it. I'm going to save the game

492
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:22,710
because I want to make sure I don't get this wrong. I want it on. I want unlimited. I want to explore.

493
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:38,500
I don't want to do the quests. Only two or three hundred. What do you mean? I'm almost out. Go to

494
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:54,729
300. Will that be there when I come back? OK. All right. You guys ready? We're going to find out

495
01:37:54,729 --> 01:38:02,180
who this ancient civilization was. So we're going to go back a hundred years ago, October 7th,

496
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:18,630
or, I mean, September, whatever. Let's go to September 7, zero, 200, zero, 100.

497
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:31,050
100 years, dude, is barely one generation. But you know what I mean? Let's go 100 or like,

498
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:44,579
I don't know, 20, 50. I'm going to try 50 A.D. Let's go. Not enough speed.

499
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:10,180
I'm just doing donuts at the ancient site. Whatever. I'm just going to go this way.

500
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:25,619
I didn't hit enter. Like, boom, it disappeared. It's fucking left here. All right. Wait, wait,

501
01:39:25,619 --> 01:39:48,760
wait, wait, wait. I did. Yes, I did. I hit enter on 5 a.m. There. What the hell was that?

502
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:19,930
Come on. I got to get speed. All right. All right. All right. I'm good. I'm good.

503
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:53,689
Oh, all right. Let's go back to that place. See what's going on. Get these fucking trees. I'm so

504
01:40:53,689 --> 01:41:14,199
mad right now. OK. I'm not going to bang a right. What's why is it so weird looking? So why is so

505
01:41:14,199 --> 01:42:11,850
green? There it is. All right. Humans have been around for 250,000 years. I can't I can't go back

506
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:34,760
that far. Go negative. I can only do zero, zero, zero. All right. Let me load it. I'm going to go

507
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:47,239
forward and see what happens. Go B.C. I can't. I don't think I can. Yeah, it's only A.D. right now.

508
01:42:47,239 --> 01:42:59,619
One A.D. would have it maybe. Yeah, I can only go to one. I want to see what happens in the future.

509
01:42:59,619 --> 01:43:11,850
So what do we think? Maybe like a thousand, like 1200 A.D. Do the quest. I'll do the quest,

510
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:16,859
but I just want to do this one more time. Let me load the game because I want to see if anything

511
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:24,779
actually changes here. Does that be cool if it did? Yeah, I'm going to lap my ass off if the

512
01:43:24,779 --> 01:43:35,260
ruins are the exact same and it's like the year 2000. OK, here we go. I think I need to put the

513
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:58,140
I can't leave the car. Stop doing that. All right. After this, we'll do the quest.

514
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:01,979
I just want to see if it was possible. All right. We're going to go to

515
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:26,789
1210. OK, what? 1500, 2000, 1500 at during the day. So like noon. You think that's good? Let's

516
01:44:26,869 --> 01:45:30,470
try it. Oh, come on. We didn't go yet. No. Although I could pretend if you were in the car here,

517
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:37,640
get out and look around and then see if you, you know, oh, hey, yeah, look how different

518
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:46,100
everything is and see if you're like, holy shit, wow, everything's so different. Let's

519
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:53,479
drive around a circle five times and tell somebody you actually time traveled. It's got to get under

520
01:45:53,479 --> 01:46:02,500
300 and then I can go. Can we get ice cream if you're good and you haven't been very good?

521
01:46:02,579 --> 01:46:38,329
It's a fucking dinosaur. I'm in the car. I'm in the car. What are you talking about?

522
01:46:38,329 --> 01:46:59,689
I'm literally in the car. Did I kill him? Did I kill him? I don't know if I killed him.

523
01:46:59,689 --> 01:47:25,100
I'm sure that won't affect anything. Why can't I kill it? I can't. I don't think I can kill it.

524
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:41,180
Wait, I come in peace. I have a cheeseburger in the backseat. No, I don't. OK, if I fed this weird

525
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:46,300
alien creature a cheeseburger, would it change genetic makeup throughout all of history of animals?

526
01:47:46,300 --> 01:48:33,159
What the fuck is happening? Like, what do we use? Let's go. No, I didn't mean to punch. Can I ride

527
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:49,050
it? I think I bugged it out when it went into the car. I can't. I want to like bring it with me.

528
01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:05,340
I'm in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. There's a bunch of sciences that definitely want

529
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:54,619
to see you. All right, whatever. Fuck you guys. I'm going to 1500 AD. See you later. Have fun

530
01:49:54,619 --> 01:50:34,699
with the fucking meteor. All right, we're at 1500. Let's go check it out. I have to bring the car,

531
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:45,380
man. Quick, dude. Make Among Us before the other people do. You don't understand. If I made Among

532
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:58,310
Us, it wouldn't be successful. Nobody would play it. No, it doesn't work like that. My Among Us

533
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:08,760
would be just barely slightly different and it would not take off. You should go. That's the idea?

534
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:16,250
What? So I go back and make Among Us and make it shitty so that nobody cares about it. You guys

535
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:22,899
really don't like that game. Of all the things we could change in all history, you want me to go back

536
01:51:22,899 --> 01:51:41,180
and make sure Among Us is not popular. Okay, this is a fun game. What's wrong with you? All right,

537
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:48,949
so this is this is where 1500 AD. It's been about a thousand years. Here we are. What does civilization

538
01:51:48,949 --> 01:52:05,739
look like? Why is it so radioactive here? Everything's, everything's radiated. Have I

539
01:52:05,739 --> 01:52:12,789
been doing it too much here? I've been traveling through time in this one location too many times

540
01:52:12,789 --> 01:52:26,229
that I've, I've irradiated the- there's nobody here? Holy shit, the whole world is green. What did I do?

541
01:52:26,869 --> 01:52:32,300
Too many times in the same spot?

542
01:53:36,920 --> 01:54:21,020
What's happening? It's even worse. What is happening to the world? What had, what happened?

543
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:27,689
Did I, I've ruined civilization. I just wanted to see if there were any people in these houses.

544
01:54:28,329 --> 01:54:38,199
I fucked up everything. Wait, what if I go to the- what if I just go to- okay, wait a minute.

545
01:54:39,699 --> 01:54:45,369
It's the year 2000. What if I just go to one of these stores? Did I really ruin everything?

546
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:51,930
I'm gonna just drive this way. Did I fuck up the whole world? Do I have to restart the whole game?

547
01:54:53,380 --> 01:55:01,050
I'm gonna go touch that. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna put my face in that. You never know guys,

548
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:05,500
it could be like the Matrix. I might put my head in here and like know how to fly a helicopter.

549
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:56,069
What? It was a collectible. Oh my fucking god. Did I seriously just kill myself? That's so fucking

550
01:55:56,069 --> 01:56:02,260
dumb. All right. Should I, I'm gonna, all right, I'm gonna go back. I think I fucked up a lot of

551
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:09,720
stuff here. Let me just see. I gotta, all right, I gotta get out of here. This is, there's nobody

552
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:14,890
here. There's no civilization here. There's just these squares with holes in them. That's it. I,

553
01:56:18,939 --> 01:56:22,859
Jerma fucking hates the Lorax. I've never seen that movie and I never read the book. I don't

554
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:37,380
know what it is. I just know Danny DeVito is the main character. I want to go here. We're gonna

555
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:43,819
check one thing. I'm going to do the mission, but I gotta turn this way because this is where

556
01:56:43,819 --> 01:56:54,979
the town is. I'm going up there. I give off Lorax vibes. What do you, what does that mean?

557
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:05,829
I don't know what that means. You have to elaborate. I don't know what you're talking about.

558
01:57:12,729 --> 01:57:35,479
Okay. So it's 537. That's the year. Droppings. Some kind of droppings over there. Okay. Now I

559
01:57:35,479 --> 01:57:54,949
gotta bang a left. He's short and orange. I mean, I am kind of orange today. I'm not wearing

560
01:57:54,949 --> 01:58:04,739
concealer. No, I'm, I am a little orange. You're right. This is a good place to do it because I

561
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:11,340
want to go to the, I'm going to save it. We're going to go to the year 2000. We're going to

562
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:24,359
go to the year 2000. No, we're not. What do I want to do? It was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during

563
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:32,119
the 18 seventies. Supposedly this led Westwood discovering the secret hideout of some 20 bandits.

564
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:39,609
The courthouse archives in Pine Lake supposedly have a document on it. All right. I'm just going

565
01:58:39,609 --> 01:58:45,130
to time travel again and load like save number one, whatever it was. Cause I kind of, I'm interested

566
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:52,260
in that. I want to know what that means. Um, this one here, drink some more water. I got it right

567
01:58:52,260 --> 01:59:02,199
here. What do you think this is? Yeah. All right. So this puts us back here. Let's go to the archives.

568
01:59:02,199 --> 01:59:16,409
I want to, I want to look at that up. So this is, I need the city archives. This looks like a city

569
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:44,069
building. This time don't dump nuclear waste everywhere. I didn't, it was empty. All right.

570
01:59:44,069 --> 01:59:59,529
This 612 store has it, but where do, it said to go up, right? Cape Dunn. That's for the other guy,

571
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:09,739
the old guy that used to be our friend. Uh, I want to do the 1800s one. So I need to go to the city

572
02:00:09,739 --> 02:00:21,720
archive where I don't know where that is. Oh, it's probably here, right? Recycling station.

573
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:32,710
Thanks. I really did not want it to go the other way. Who's talking to me?

574
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:39,109
All right. I need the, I need the courthouse or something. Wait, what do you have?

575
02:00:42,729 --> 02:00:47,210
Huh? Yes. Why are you sad? Uh, well, I don't know if I should even tell at this point.

576
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:55,020
What's about her? Yeah. Well, Sandy, she works in that ice cream shop just across the square.

577
02:00:57,399 --> 02:01:02,840
Lowers his voice. I mean, yes, I want to ask her out. Why don't you just ask her out? I thought

578
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:12,460
about making a nice present of sorts that would fit her. Okay. A flower, just one flower. No,

579
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:18,520
it's a special one. It's called the Eleanor. Seemingly everybody tells me I should stop

580
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:22,680
dreaming. This particular plan is extinct for hundreds of years now. I know I can find one.

581
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:32,170
I'll have to search really, really hard. Am I really going to go back in time and pick a flower

582
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:51,109
for this guy? Sure. Yeah, I can help. Okay. Look at the bookstore. Okay. I think you can look at the

583
02:01:51,109 --> 02:01:56,699
bookstore just next to the mechanic. Get that flower book and see if it can help you. I want

584
02:01:56,699 --> 02:02:04,569
to go do the bandit thing. All right. No, no, no. I want the courthouse. I need that map to show me

585
02:02:04,569 --> 02:02:17,739
where the courthouse is. Fucking burping and y'all and you can hear it. I hate that. Do the flower

586
02:02:17,739 --> 02:03:17,000
plot line. No, that's boring. I want to go fight the bandits. I'm not hitting the tree. Okay. Town

587
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:26,340
square. It's probably where the statue was, right? I'm going to assume that statue is over here.

588
02:03:37,699 --> 02:04:01,079
Oh, information. This is definitely it. 100%. Okay. Post office archives. There it is.

589
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:25,130
What's that? Why is that a health bar on the screen? Okay. This is nice. I'm looking for info

590
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:47,939
on the robbery that happened. Nevermind. You're not going to help me. Oh shit. After a lengthy

591
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:51,460
interrogation, I managed to deduct that the thieves have been hiding underneath the well

592
02:04:52,579 --> 02:04:58,180
known waterfall in the west. That's when I ambushed and defeated the 20 bandits in their boss.

593
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:02,340
My new friend helped me in the ambush by his clever distraction.

594
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:09,130
I recovered a load of redacted material from the cave. All the captured bandits are to be relocated

595
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:18,010
to Isla de los Tontos charged for robbery. By the speedy aid of my friend. This is,

596
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:24,060
they're talking about me. There was a minor altercation afterwards with

597
02:05:25,130 --> 02:05:30,220
Diego's gang. They tried to steal our recovered goods from the bank. They weren't much a problem.

598
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:35,579
I suggest also moving them to Isla de los Tontos charged for it. Okay. So this is 1871.

599
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:45,500
1871. The robbery of Pine Island Nashville occurred March 15th, 1871 at 1 20 p.m.

600
02:05:46,060 --> 02:06:04,619
So we should go there at 12 and just wait. Write that down. Yeah, you write it down for me.

601
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:15,109
It happened at the well. All right. 12 o'clock, March 15th, 1871, 12 o'clock. Pine Island National

602
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:47,270
Bank. Write it down. Let's go. You write it down. I can't. My hands are occupied. All right. Where's

603
02:06:47,270 --> 02:07:18,439
the bank? Fuck. Where's the bank? I see. I didn't know where the bank is. Park train station. It's

604
02:07:18,439 --> 02:07:31,609
not on here. I said to find it. I know you have a quest, but fine. What is it? Any rumors? I heard

605
02:07:31,609 --> 02:07:36,489
back in the 70s there was this accordion man who you would not want to meet at nights in the forest.

606
02:07:39,619 --> 02:07:42,899
I suppose you could try it in the town archives. I don't care about the accordion man.

607
02:07:43,699 --> 02:08:00,630
Where's the bank? Ice cream. Where's the bank? Is this a bank? No, it's like a recycling center.

608
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:17,000
Where's the bank? Books, hoverboards. I don't know. I'm not doing accordion man. I don't want

609
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:44,710
to do that right now. If I zoom in, will it say? Do it after the bank? Maybe. You didn't read

610
02:08:44,710 --> 02:09:01,130
homestuck. What does it have to do with anything? This is not a bank. This is a library. There's the

611
02:09:01,130 --> 02:09:21,380
lab. Where's this fucking bank? Oh, bank time. So this is where I need to be. I'm going to get here

612
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:30,329
at noon. That's let me look at the map because literally I've messed this up. All right. It is

613
02:09:30,329 --> 02:09:37,300
right below that pine lake thing, right below it kind of to the south western area right

614
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:49,720
into the ice cream shop. Let's go. All right. Where's the car? All right. I'm just going to

615
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:53,960
drive down this street and I'm going to get there at noon. We'll be there about an hour early

616
02:09:53,960 --> 02:10:04,149
for me to stop the robbery. You're disgusting. Why would you say something weird like that?

617
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:27,430
All right. Here we go. Get in. I'm ready. Let's do it. What was the date again? It was something

618
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:58,439
something is March 3 15. No, what do you? Okay. Three. I'm trying to do the fucking month. What

619
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:11,079
is it? Oh, oh, three. What is going on right now? Oh, it won't accept. Oh, three. Oh, three.

620
02:11:11,079 --> 02:11:28,039
I just did that three times. Oh, three. Stop giving random dates. 1871 at 12 noon. Let's go for it.

621
02:11:28,039 --> 02:12:15,880
Let's fucking do it. Let's get to the bank. I need a better straight away. There we go. What even

622
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:40,140
happened? Too much juice. All right. The bank. They're going to rob the bank. Turn that off.

623
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:49,689
Turn that off. Turn it off. All right. They're going to rob the bank in an hour. I want to sell

624
02:12:49,689 --> 02:13:43,430
my no. What do I do? How do I stop them? I'm going to do anybody suspicious. I don't have

625
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:52,859
a weapon or anything. Go tell the sheriff. Sheriff. Sheriff. Listen to me. Am I too late?

626
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:07,819
What exploded? What did I just do? I didn't just blow up the bank. Get out of the fucking way.

627
02:14:07,819 --> 02:14:24,220
Sheriff. Sheriff. Everything's safe. No, it's not safe. Oh my God. What time is it? Four. Wait,

628
02:14:24,220 --> 02:15:03,029
they already robbed it? Is that them robbing the bank? What? I did it. Wait, why were they coming

629
02:15:03,029 --> 02:15:10,489
out of my car as if I brought them here? I backed up the car into the bank and they all started

630
02:15:10,489 --> 02:15:43,880
getting out of the car. Everybody wants to rob it. Okay. So I went to... Wait, what? Oh, it's an auto

631
02:15:43,880 --> 02:16:24,460
save. I'm getting in the car. Should I get a gun? They haven't robbed it yet. Why did the month and

632
02:16:24,539 --> 02:16:48,059
day change? Throw uranium at them. Year 2000. Wait, what's going on? How come the dates are

633
02:16:48,059 --> 02:17:21,989
different? I'm so confused. Oh, okay. 120. I'm ready. Oh my God. Go talk to the sheriff. I tried

634
02:17:21,989 --> 02:17:29,030
to talk to the sheriff and he didn't have anything to say. He just said, oh, all right. There's no

635
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:59,059
options. Here we go. That wasn't the sheriff. Why was he standing behind the counter? I can't

636
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:13,059
interact with him. Sorry. What fucking time is it? What? 13. Oh, right. It's not a regular clock.

637
02:18:13,059 --> 02:19:10,920
It's a 20. What the fuck? It kind of works. Five minutes and then another wave. Excuse me?

638
02:19:11,639 --> 02:19:25,100
Excuse me? The car won't turn on. What? You can't be fucking serious. Why is it so dark?

639
02:19:39,129 --> 02:19:53,319
Why did the fucking car turn off? I'm getting a gun. What is that? Did it run out of gas? I don't

640
02:19:53,319 --> 02:19:59,829
know what happened. I need to go get a weapon or something. $4 back in the 1800s is like $50

641
02:19:59,829 --> 02:20:30,860
million. So I'll be fine. Two bucks. What do you? I don't think I can get a gun. So how am I

642
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:37,020
supposed to? There's a lot of people that come in. Can I get like a melee weapon? Blacksmith. Here

643
02:20:37,020 --> 02:21:15,559
we go. Can I buy something? Ooh, revolver parts. Okay. 20 bucks. I need money. Motherfucker. I'm

644
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:20,120
going to go back in time again. I gotta go find gold or something. Go back another. Oh my God.

645
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:37,909
I gotta go back like three days and find gold and sell it. I gotta find gold here. You should

646
02:21:37,909 --> 02:21:57,610
just rob the bank. Okay. No, there's gotta be gold, right? Rob the bank and then travel back in time

647
02:21:57,610 --> 02:22:03,590
and pay with the stolen money. But wouldn't I always rob the bank if I kept going back?

648
02:22:04,309 --> 02:22:36,229
What about their hideout? Don't you have a bank to rob? Why is everybody chasing me?

649
02:22:36,950 --> 02:23:10,440
They're not robbing the bank. I'm preventing the bank robbery. They're shooting each other.

650
02:23:10,920 --> 02:24:08,250
The fuck? What happened? I think if I wrap around and eat a barbecue sandwich, I think I'd be fine.

651
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:51,340
Where's the barbecue place? Get out of here. There's people attacking town. I got it. I got

652
02:24:51,340 --> 02:25:03,479
it. I got it. Quick, quick, quick. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No, I want to order a barbecue. I want

653
02:25:03,479 --> 02:25:11,079
to order a sandwich. I can't have a barbecue. This is the barbecue place, right? What's going on?

654
02:25:11,079 --> 02:25:27,350
Barbecue. Get rid of me. Fuck. Where are they going? Bill Banker said, what was that?

655
02:25:28,149 --> 02:25:40,540
Bill, if you're not paying attention this entire time, where's the gold? My gold. I guess I have

656
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:48,059
to open up the reserves in the bunker. Wait, why does the sheriff not have a gun? The sheriff

657
02:25:48,059 --> 02:26:16,739
doesn't have a gun. This is fucked up. I have to hide the car. These are the time police. Why are

658
02:26:16,819 --> 02:26:26,700
they? They're not the time police. They're time agents. What are you talking about? They're

659
02:26:28,299 --> 02:26:47,799
time agents? I'm so confused. Let me bully you. Wait, what?

660
02:26:52,950 --> 02:27:02,309
Why did they kill that guy? What's happening? Why they're dressed like they're from this time

661
02:27:02,309 --> 02:27:09,659
period. All right. I have to hide the car. I'm going to hide the car. I'm going to hide the car,

662
02:27:09,659 --> 02:27:13,850
hide the car, hide the car. I thought that was an entire group of people coming to get me

663
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:20,709
that they are dressed with their have like they have bandit masks. What do you mean? They're time

664
02:27:21,350 --> 02:27:57,700
agents. Get the car out of the way. Hide it. Okay, here we go. They're trying to blend in.

665
02:27:58,819 --> 02:28:10,420
Okay, Bill Banker. What do you have? Buy a dollar for 210 coins. Buy 100 gold for 100. I can't even

666
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:29,100
look at that. My head hurts. Look at it. All right. Now I got to protect it. Fucking time agents.

667
02:28:30,059 --> 02:28:40,200
They thought they were bank robbers. What time is it? All right. They'll be here any minute.

668
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:46,379
I don't know what time it is because my fucking car is over there in a ditch. So I don't know

669
02:28:46,379 --> 02:30:04,649
what time it is. Okay, cool. All right. They're going to come in a minute. What is this game? The

670
02:30:04,649 --> 02:30:12,709
game is called No Time. It is on Steam. It's early access. I think it's actually really fun.

671
02:30:12,709 --> 02:30:19,299
I am confused about it a few times though. Once you get used to it. I think this is really cool.

672
02:30:19,299 --> 02:30:35,129
This is a really great idea. All right. They should be coming any second now. Yep. Did they come?

673
02:30:35,129 --> 02:30:52,969
From what direction did they come though? What a beautiful day. Bill Banker. What? Go, go, go.

674
02:30:52,969 --> 02:31:22,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Why was he already in there? I need a

675
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:31,030
fucking gun. I'm so red. I'm so sick and fucking tired of waiting. I'm not waiting anymore. I'm

676
02:31:31,030 --> 02:31:36,709
just getting in the car. No, get out now. Get out. I'm going. I don't care. Put me back. Take this

677
02:31:36,709 --> 02:32:15,399
fucking thing out. Time agents. I'll show you how we're going to handle this. No, not 11. No, not

678
02:32:15,399 --> 02:32:39,059
1150. You piece of shit. No, not March. Why can't I do 115? At this point it's already...

679
02:32:39,059 --> 02:33:07,620
Just give me a fucking calendar. 03. 15. 1871. 0115. I don't care. I'm not waiting. I want to see if

680
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:24,540
this works actually. I'm testing something. It doesn't work. Fucking never mind. Reload the game.

681
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:29,819
Reload the game. Reload the game. I was trying to send it and just not even be in it.

682
02:33:48,659 --> 02:33:58,979
Okay. How come the trunk is closed? All right. I guess the correct way to do this is to get a gun.

683
02:34:00,389 --> 02:34:08,780
Right? We're going to find a job. The blacksmith pays well. Really? Wait, I can work there?

684
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:23,459
Need help? Grill steaks. Holy shit. Okay, cool. Prepare the steaks on the grill. Take an order.

685
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:29,540
I'll take a steak, please. What do you want?

686
02:34:46,549 --> 02:34:55,639
What happened? Prepare the steaks on the grill. Once they're done,

687
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:03,940
put them on the plate and ring the bell. That's what I did. A steak, please. Yes. Okay. Here's

688
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:22,100
a steak. Why did the guy leave? What the fuck? What? Don't order food and fucking leave, dude.

689
02:35:23,059 --> 02:35:38,969
The fucking bank. The bank, the bank, the bank, the bank, the bank.

690
02:35:44,780 --> 02:36:17,399
All the time people are... Why is there no juice? Oh, because I didn't load it. I have to go back.

691
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:28,790
I got to go back. I got to go back here and I got to come back here like a day early.

692
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:41,780
I got to go back a day early. I can't be hit 15 minutes before it happens. I got to be here

693
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:49,260
like a few days early. Go and stop it potentially at the hideout. Why are you forcing yourself?

694
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:51,659
I'm not forcing myself to play this. I actually am having a good time.

695
02:36:53,670 --> 02:37:01,979
You suck and this game sucks. Why don't you go rake some leaves then? What are you doing here?

696
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:08,600
Why don't you go rake some leaves? If you don't like the game and you don't like me,

697
02:37:09,399 --> 02:37:13,459
what is keeping you here? Why don't you go fucking rake some leaves?

698
02:37:15,690 --> 02:37:35,540
What do you want me to do for you? It's summer. So go rake some rocks. Okay. I am going to do

699
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:47,340
this mission. Dude, your stream sucks. This game sucks. My computer sucks. I have a virus on my

700
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:55,670
computer. Something smells in my room. Something smells in my room too. Oh, by the way, I ordered

701
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:58,469
something from Amazon. I didn't get here today. It was supposed to get here. I don't know, man.

702
02:37:58,469 --> 02:38:17,209
What do you want me to say? Spray some air freshener in your room. Go play Scrabble.

703
02:38:17,770 --> 02:38:25,379
All right. I have an idea. This game doesn't suck. You just don't have an IQ like I do to

704
02:38:25,379 --> 02:38:38,420
understand it. Okay. March 14th, 1871 at 12 o'clock. This gives us plenty of opportunity

705
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:49,319
to make some stakes. We can make some money. I'm going to buy a gun and I'm going to stop

706
02:38:49,319 --> 02:39:28,309
the robbery. Let's go for it. You ready? I am. We're here a day early. I have a day to get

707
02:39:28,309 --> 02:39:35,049
enough money. I'm going to buy a gun and I'm going to be prepared this time. Sometimes you sound like

708
02:39:35,129 --> 02:39:40,489
Peter Griffin. It's because Peter Griffin and I, Peter Griffin's a fictional character from

709
02:39:40,489 --> 02:39:44,409
fictional New England. He has a fictional New England accent. Sometimes I have a New England

710
02:39:44,409 --> 02:39:51,770
accent. I grew up there. So sorry. Me and Peter Griffin are from the same fucking area. I'm sorry.

711
02:39:51,770 --> 02:40:01,030
I didn't. I'm sorry that I sound like Peter Griffin. I'm leaving that there. We're doing

712
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:24,549
this without the time. Hey, nobody asked for your life story. That's so stupid. Where are you from

713
02:40:24,549 --> 02:40:35,860
in New England? It's from Rhode Island. It's called Kohog. It's like a small town. All right,

714
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:58,870
let's make some money. You look like a man that could use a stake. Can I help you? Anybody want

715
02:40:58,870 --> 02:41:25,290
any food? Nobody's here. Do I have like all of my clothes on? Everyone's just sitting here looking

716
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:44,709
at me. What's, nobody hungry? All right. That was fun. All right. What about the blacksmith?

717
02:41:44,709 --> 02:42:05,030
He might've bugged out. Actually something really important. Oh my God. I forgot. It's going to take

718
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:11,139
me a fucking whole day to go back to them. I didn't save it. I got to go back to the car.

719
02:42:14,090 --> 02:42:43,459
Oh, I got to go back to the car. I will be, what's going on? What? I'm here a day early.

720
02:42:48,469 --> 02:44:04,860
You fucking assholes. God, leave me alone. I didn't save it. Why can I kill them with a car?

721
02:44:24,229 --> 02:44:32,409
I didn't save the game. I have no health. People were tougher back then, dude. How do I get rid

722
02:44:32,409 --> 02:45:09,450
of these guys? You're doomed. Okay. At least the game is saved. I'm going to eat some food.

723
02:45:10,010 --> 02:45:16,469
I don't know if they're going to follow me or not. Probably not. Okay. I have a save game.

724
02:45:16,469 --> 02:45:31,100
Back to the town. Okay. Blacksmith. Can I do some work for the blacksmith?

725
02:45:31,979 --> 02:45:40,620
I got to be able to eat, right? Yeah. Okay. Need help? Good luck. Your task is to craft

726
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:48,379
tools on demand. You'll get a guide with every new product. Okay. A woodcutter's axe, please.

727
02:45:49,180 --> 02:46:41,659
You got it. Woodcutter's axe. Okay. And then you hit it with a hammer. Okay. And then this

728
02:46:42,969 --> 02:47:10,379
goes into the water. Okay. And then this goes on a stick. I got it. Where's the customer? Nice.

729
02:47:10,379 --> 02:47:20,120
All right. What do you want? Hammer, please. You got it. Hammer. Hilt. How do you make a hammer?

730
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:55,430
It's literally the same exact thing. Good. All right. Anybody else? Can I use an axe as a weapon?

731
02:47:55,430 --> 02:48:12,069
Maybe I can. All right. Take a woodcutter's axe. And I... All right. Let's go. I made it with an axe

732
02:48:12,069 --> 02:48:57,559
hilt. I don't know. Whatever. It's fine. Is it not ready? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. I'm gonna make

733
02:48:57,559 --> 02:49:23,379
like 50 bucks. You made a block of cheese. Kind of. I'm running out of time. I got enough to do one

734
02:49:23,379 --> 02:50:11,290
more. What do you want? Hurry up. Axe. Done. Go. Quick. What was wrong with it? What's going on?

735
02:50:11,290 --> 02:50:40,889
Whatever. I'm making... I'm taking it. I'm making an axe myself. $65. Go get my gun. Who sells the

736
02:50:40,889 --> 02:50:57,700
gun? The blacksmith sells the gun. All right. Buy bitcoin right now and cash it out in 300 years.

737
02:50:57,700 --> 02:51:11,690
Okay. And I want the cowboy costume. That's too much money. All right. So now what do I do with

738
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:44,680
this? What am I supposed to do with this? How do I make it? Revolver parts. You have to build it?

739
02:51:44,680 --> 02:52:02,139
How do you... How do I do that? I have to put it together? Put it together. Is there instructions?

740
02:52:02,139 --> 02:52:19,750
Press the build button? I don't think there is a build button. Is it just junk? I don't think it's

741
02:52:19,829 --> 02:52:33,930
junk. He's pretending. Dude, I got a box of junk on the ground. How am I supposed to turn this into a

742
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:55,110
gun? Is there a gunsmith? There might be. Not in this town. Unless the sheriff can do it. Maybe

743
02:52:55,110 --> 02:53:11,700
talk to the blacksmith again. Press eight on the number pad. B. Eight does not do it. Can you make

744
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:30,040
anything with this? All this guy sells is props. Okay. Two and then three. Somebody has to be able

745
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:52,100
to put this together. All right. I've maybe I should bring it to a different time period.

746
02:53:52,100 --> 02:54:05,079
Oh my god. Leave me alone. E doesn't do it either. It's definitely something I have to make.

747
02:54:05,079 --> 02:54:16,520
I probably need a recipe or something. Yeah. Put it on the blacksmith's table.

748
02:54:38,709 --> 02:54:45,479
Use the bossy. I don't know what that is. I don't think I can do anything with this yet.

749
02:54:45,479 --> 02:55:18,940
I probably have to unlock it. Unless somebody else can make this into a gun. Okay. Do not travel to

750
02:55:18,940 --> 02:55:34,440
666 AD. I don't even know where the car is, man. Do the main quest. Okay. Um, is crafting hidden?

751
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:43,700
Wait, so I can take this with me to and make it and then come back. Let me go in the car.

752
02:55:44,500 --> 02:55:57,620
How far back and travel? You can go to 0001 AD. One AD. Jeremy, say hi to my grandma. She's 82 and

753
02:55:57,620 --> 02:56:10,940
loves your streams. Um, hi grandma. All right. I'm gonna I'm giving this game like another 30 minutes

754
02:56:10,940 --> 02:56:45,110
and we're gonna move on to something else. Hi grandma. Wait, is it what day is it? Do they

755
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:50,709
attack the bank right now? Go to the future where the gun is already built. All right. Hold on.

756
02:57:50,409 --> 02:58:25,850
I don't have any more fuel. Okay. I need to reload. Was that way too dank? I'm sorry. Way

757
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:46,459
too dank. All right. You know, my favorite part about this game is this. I love the traveling

758
02:58:46,459 --> 02:58:53,510
around. I want to find a good place to go. I'll do 2023. My brain is too small for this game. All

759
02:58:53,510 --> 02:58:59,850
right. I'll be honest with you. See, for instance, I just tried to type in 15 for the month. There's

760
02:58:59,850 --> 03:00:07,139
not a 15th month. Let's go. Wedged in somewhere. How did I go perfectly into a wedge? What the

761
03:00:07,139 --> 03:00:29,420
hell is that? I can't, I don't think I can get in the car. All right. We're good. Headlights. Let's

762
03:00:29,420 --> 03:00:54,899
go. So here's the donut shop. Are the aliens or something? What is in the road? Is that mine?

763
03:00:55,620 --> 03:01:12,040
I'll take it, I guess. God, stop. Oh my fuck. I keep thinking it's a fucking monster.

764
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:59,020
What's going on these days? Watch out for the crabs. There we go. Okay. I want that. It's like

765
03:01:59,020 --> 03:02:05,139
flying spaceships. Derma likes this game. I really do. I like the idea of this game a lot.

766
03:02:05,139 --> 03:02:51,079
Was there a giant laser? What the hell is that? Is that the track? What is that? I'm investigating.

767
03:02:51,079 --> 03:02:56,840
Don't read into it. He likes it. No, I think it's a really, really fun experience. I think it's a

768
03:02:56,840 --> 03:03:10,309
really, really cool idea. And I commend the devs for trying something different. My brain just can't

769
03:03:10,309 --> 03:03:28,469
handle going into like three places at the same time. Stop being so nice, Madge. Why? It takes a

770
03:03:28,469 --> 03:03:45,340
lot of work. I'm still here playing it, aren't I? I want to know what the laser is. I'm going up

771
03:03:45,340 --> 03:04:27,239
there. The flashlight. What the hell? All right. I'm going up to the laser. Drive up there. I mean,

772
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:41,290
you think I'm going to drive up this hill? That's not going to happen. Oh, there's a waterfall in

773
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:52,219
2020 AD. Oh, this is not a laser. This is a track. I'm going to find the laser beam. It's not what

774
03:04:52,219 --> 03:05:25,909
I think it is. Very futuristic. This is 2023. All right. Now I'll do 9999, right? I will do the

775
03:05:25,909 --> 03:05:38,260
coveted 9999. Oh, no, we can't. It stops at 2030. Right, right, right, right. All right. Well,

776
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:42,739
that was fun. That was a cool little game. We're going to move on. I just wanted to play it. I saw

777
03:05:42,739 --> 03:05:47,930
it and I was going to play it. Whatever. I think it was really cool. I think it was fun. I think

778
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:51,770
it was interesting. There's a whole main quest line if you'd like to try it yourself. It's called

779
03:05:51,770 --> 03:05:57,049
No Time. It's on Steam currently on Early Access. It seems like there's a lot of content in it so

780
03:05:57,049 --> 03:06:07,590
far. That has been Checking It Out Thursdays. We're going to check out something else. Go back to

781
03:06:07,590 --> 03:06:50,459
Wheel of Fortune. Whoa, what's this? Oh, it's a lighthouse. Okay. Maybe I should have got the car.

782
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:54,760
That does not hurt. That doesn't hurt.

783
03:06:58,600 --> 03:07:03,989
Shit. All right. We're going to move on. I'm going to take a break. I'm going to pee. I'll be right

784
03:07:03,989 --> 03:07:08,700
back. That was No Time. There's a lot in that game. If you want to check it out for yourself,

785
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:12,299
give it a go. I think that was a fun part of the stream. We're going to move on to part two,

786
03:07:12,940 --> 03:07:16,940
which that's going to be. What would you like to know? I would too because I don't know.

787
03:07:16,940 --> 03:09:29,459
I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. We'll figure it out. See you guys in two minutes.
