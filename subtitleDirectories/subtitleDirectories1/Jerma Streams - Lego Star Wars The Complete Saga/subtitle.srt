00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:12,070
Hello, ladies and gentlemen of the Jerma nation. I'm here to address you guys and talk about a few things.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,870
If you missed the pre-stream chat, we had just a little tiny little couple of bumps

3
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:28,760
about what we may or may not be doing today. Sorry, yeah, banana bros. You guys hear me out here?

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:47,240
A dog just barked at me. People are barking at me. Let's talk about this for a second. If you

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,619
didn't- if you weren't in the pre-stream chat, we had a- well, to understand what's going on now,

6
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,329
you got to understand the history. Last night, I made a bet, which was a totally just fun- just

7
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:05,620
for fun bet, uh, in the realm of around two and a half billion dollars with chat. And I was told

8
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,150
that if we got to pick the game today, that that debt, at least- at least 250 million dollars was

9
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:22,819
gonna come off that debt. And do not be mistaken, I will shave money off that debt. 100 million here,

10
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:30,260
500 million there. This is worth at least four to five hundred million dollars. In like joke,

11
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,579
like hilarious funny drama currency, not real United States dollars. There's already a debt

12
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:48,340
counter. That's hilarious. Uh, last night, in bed, I continued to laugh. I couldn't stop. Uh, I woke

13
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,019
up with like a hangover this morning. I was actually like humor hungover, somebody said.

14
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:04,420
But anyways, I was like, I'm gonna shave off some of the debt here. Just a lot of debt. Uh, so I was

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,810
like, let's do a viewer's choice. You- whatever game anybody wants. And they chose Star Wars Legos.

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:22,009
Lego Star Wars. Didn't get here easily. It was very, very dramatic. There were like 30 polls that

17
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:31,129
had to be done. We eliminated Neopets. We even eliminated Doki Doki Literature Club. Can you

18
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:41,259
believe it? I can't. And we're stuck here. Well, I say stuck here. This game's fun, isn't it?

19
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:52,680
Isn't this game good? I feel people love this Lego Star Wars franchise. I've never played any of

20
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:01,419
these. I always skipped them. Because to me, these were the licensed, licensed video games. I never

21
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,699
gave them a chance. Because when you have a licensed video game already, it's like, okay,

22
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,099
this might be dog shit. But then when you have a licensed, licensed video game,

23
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:19,370
that's where you lose me a little bit. I'm not sure. It's good. Okay. They're so good.

24
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,060
Recount. We already did a recount. Because I put a few games up there that I was like, oh,

25
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,110
how about we play these ones, guys? And then everyone freaked out. It was- if you just came

26
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,789
to the stream right now, I've been sitting in this chair for like an hour and 10 minutes.

27
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:44,039
Just debating with chat back and forth. And like trying to quell the uprising. It's been like a

28
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:56,500
full hour. Why didn't you tell anyone? Because this is important. Pre-stream chat has a lot of

29
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:06,139
power. And it's a lot of people. It's like a thousand people. Pre-stream chat decides a lot

30
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:19,050
of things. They do. Now do another recount. It's like 500 people. No, it's like 10,000 people.

31
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:30,660
But anyways, yes, today we're going to play Lego Star Wars. I hope these are fun. Because if not,

32
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,870
then we have to pivot to signal simulator. And if we have to pivot again, we're pivoting to my

33
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,230
choice, which is the Black Masses. It's like a medieval 5,000 people on the screen first person

34
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:56,759
game. So there's a tiered amount of options here over the next few days, over the next week.

35
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:08,019
I'm a new viewer. Can I get a song? Hey, sup. Hey, sup. I don't know what your name was.

36
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:17,370
I was so desperately reaching to say your name after hey. It was like, hey, fuck, what was his

37
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:25,740
name? I don't know. I was trying so hard. Okay, here we go. I don't- we're going to start- this

38
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,060
is the complete saga. There's like 12 games in this. I'm only going to play- I don't think

39
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,139
I'm going to play this again. I want to make that really clear to a shitload of people here.

40
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:41,480
I don't think this is going to be a thing that you can expect to see on this channel all the time.

41
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:48,839
By the way, see you in hell when I get this whole stream removed. Can I turn off the-

42
00:05:48,839 --> 00:06:01,160
should I like mess with the music? What if I just fuck with it? Does that count?

43
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,740
All right, go, go, go, go, go before I get in trouble. New game.

44
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,589
F2. I try to play with two people at the same time on keyboard. All right, hold on. Wait,

45
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:30,459
the audio is so low. Are we in a bar? Let's turn it up. Okay, so who am I? I'm a big Star Wars fan,

46
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,019
so I don't want to mess this up. This is Qui-Gon Jinn, and that's Obi-Wan Kenobi,

47
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:44,949
and that's Megamind. I just- wait, you can- I just killed a guy. I just killed a guy.

48
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:54,120
Who are these people? Are we in a bar? Holy shit, what am I doing? Zero percent?

49
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:04,860
What? What? What's happening? Why am I killing all these people? How do I- how do I do the

50
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:19,990
tutorial? Holy shit, Qui-Gon's dead. What was I supposed to do? One minute. Okay, you can't kill

51
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:32,939
the band. How do I do anything? Qui-Gon Jinn. Holy shit, that was cool. It's the hub world. Oh,

52
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,139
all right, all right, hub world. What do I- oh, I can force grab. This is actually kind of cool.

53
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:54,009
Just go to the door? Oh, okay. Episode one, the Phantom Menace. Oh, cool. Wait, what is all this?

54
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:08,019
I'm so glad I don't have to do this puzzle on my own. Oh, sick. Okay, I got a heart piece and a

55
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:19,459
coin. I have 1,100 coins. Oh, did I just go into the Phantom Menace? Why are we in, like, another

56
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:30,660
cafeteria? They're called studs. I don't know the Lego-Lingo. The last time I used Legos was

57
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,059
probably, I don't know, 100 years ago? Phantom- okay, chapter one, negotiations. Here we go.

58
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:47,700
Story. Yeah. No, stop! Turn that off. Turn it down. I can't turn it off. Yeah, I can. Okay, Phantom

59
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:57,799
Menace, chapter one, negotiations. Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic with a

60
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:03,240
blockade of deadly battleships. The Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the

61
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,299
small planet of Naboo. The Supreme- this isn't the same without this, is it? The Supreme Chancellor

62
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:23,669
has secretly dispatched Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to settle the conflict.

63
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:36,490
All right, we're good. Dude, you- I can't hide a DMCA from that. That initial- my channel's gone.

64
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:46,250
Like, all it needs is that first- they have that exact algorithm in place. Is this voice acted?

65
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:53,700
Are they silent protagonists? Wait, why was C-3PO just not textured? He was not even-

66
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,960
he wasn't colored in. Isn't he gold? Oh, that took me all morning to make!

67
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:11,259
At least those guys are dead. What? Walk- what? Walk up to friendly characters and press Y to

68
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:21,100
take control of them. Oh, shit, you can, like, mind jump? Jedi mind jumping. Okay, I'm gonna be

69
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:32,360
honest. I'm more of a- I'm more of an Obi-Wan guy than I am a Qui-Gon Jinn guy. That's a fake fan.

70
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:41,289
How am I a fake fan? Is that, like, Obi-Wan more than Qui-Gon? What's the point of collecting- is

71
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:50,419
there- all right, is there a reason to collect these? That's a Reddit take. How is that a Reddit

72
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,980
take? Because I like- Obi-Wan's a classic character. What are you talking about? Wait.

73
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:08,490
All right, let me out. Qui-Gon, how do we open the door? This is a double jump. Jedi mind grab.

74
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:19,320
Okay, I got it. Here we go! Okay, if I was 11, this would be the most fun game I've ever played.

75
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:29,179
Can I throw- wait, I'm putting it back together again. That's pretty cool. You missed a stud. Do

76
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:38,629
I really care? Get the blue or- all right, all right, I'll get the blue. How do I block? Okay,

77
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:43,190
I'm gonna be very, very honest with you. This feels very strange without any other sound effects

78
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:51,529
besides music and lightsaber sounds. This makes these guys psycho. This is terrifying.

79
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,690
Well, pepe D. Wait, so this is just one of those games where you walk around and just touch things

80
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,090
and let them play their funny little- oh, look, a point and click adventure. I clicked on the shoe

81
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:27,110
and it went- no. Not even, like, any attack sounds? Silent protagonist Jedi. I don't like it.

82
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:40,419
Rip Vod. I don't- okay, look. Where- I gotta ask that question. This is an important question

83
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:48,490
for twitch.tv's lawyers. What- where's the line? Can I play Jedi Star Wars on stream if, like,

84
00:12:48,490 --> 00:13:01,720
there's a Jedi sound effect? Can I play this? Am I not allowed to play this? No, I definitely am.

85
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,600
This is in the context of playing the video game. I'm not- I'm not showing you guys, like,

86
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,200
my favorite Star Wars soundtrack. Okay, I can understand how people think this is fun.

87
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,559
Everyone of these little buttons has toys in it and you just collect them.

88
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:30,740
Press every button. Wait, what's this? I can be C-3PO? C-3PO, answer the call. He's trying to call

89
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,220
us. All right, I gotta stop treating this like you guys are 10 years old. C-3PO is trying to call us.

90
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:52,779
Hello? C-3PO. He's not there. Guys, I hope he's not in prison or anything. Who's behind this door?

91
00:13:53,419 --> 00:14:13,429
Oh, I don't know. Bad guys. Bad guys, alert. Watch out. C-3PO. Okay. Just kill this- oh, mini-boss.

92
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:22,250
Don't you guys think it's fun whenever, like, there's like a kid in the room and you're playing

93
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,610
a video game and you're, like, clearly killing people? You have to say, oh, yeah, I gotta get

94
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:47,750
the bad guys. That means I'm killing people. Oh, bad guys, get the bad guys. Oops. R2. Bad guy down.

95
00:14:50,059 --> 00:15:01,509
There is this C-3PO. So, if I fill that meter in the top, what does it do? You're a fake fan.

96
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:11,620
Can't wait to use get the bad guy. I don't know, when I play, like, an FPS game and I, like,

97
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:20,779
shotgun somebody right, like, in the face. Oh, I got the bad guy. Oh, C-3PO. Oh, wait, C-3PO

98
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:33,460
can open the C-3PO doors. Droids can operate Lego panels. Press B to activate them. R2. Press B.

99
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:51,379
B. Oh, he has to go to a 3PO-only pod. It's over here. 3PO-onlies. Okay, 3PO's are allowed in here.

100
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,980
Is this regain control of your other characters by moving up to them and pressing- I don't know,

101
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:12,600
I want to be 3PO. I'll be Qui-gon. What am I supposed to do with this? All right, put this

102
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:21,720
in the- wait, what is it? It's doing it on its own. Oh, it's just doing it on its own. I did it.

103
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,110
Now move it, right? I can't- I made it too high? I don't know what the hell's going on.

104
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:44,860
You can bounce. It's an optional puzzle. I don't know. I don't even know what I was doing.

105
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,500
Okay, you can't say like, oh, I'll bet I'll go to a little kid's game. I thought I had to, like,

106
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,629
move them into the lasers or something. I didn't know this was a puzzle. I didn't know what was

107
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:12,789
going on. I'm fine, look. Softlocked in a kid's game. Hey, no, stop doing the fucking Mario

108
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:45,750
backflip. All right, I actually don't get it. Toddler. Is he stoned? Stand on it. I'm back in

109
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,309
free play. Wait, I can't- there's a wall. I know there's a wall over there, but I can't- but do I-

110
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:56,059
No, I'm not- I can't do anything here. Come back later. Wait, why would they make a backtracking

111
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:15,690
in a toddler game? Go in the vent. You can't go in a vent. Wrong character. Don't you have to be,

112
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,839
like, R2D2? Okay. Need a small character, sure. I'll go get R2. All right, where's that- where's

113
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:35,369
that guy? Where's the PO? You need to come back in free play. Oh, well, how am I supposed to know

114
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:45,720
that? All right, come on. Get in there. In the- in the back of the box said there was 120 playable

115
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:59,319
characters. Is that real? There's 120 playable characters? I feel like I'm playing The Lost

116
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:14,549
Vikings for that Blizzard game. Oh, what's this? Oh, sick. Hold on, Otto wants to leave. I tell

117
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:28,089
you what, go. He's a good dog. Run on player two. No, I'm not gonna do that right now. I actually

118
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:34,539
kind of like this. It's fun. All right, so how long is this one? How long is the Phantom Menace?

119
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:54,680
Within an hour? Two hours? 40 minutes? It's about an hour. Whoa. Watch out! 10 hours. At this pace,

120
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:07,339
10 hours. I don't- I- Press X to dodge or deflect blaster bolts. I tried to double tap. All right,

121
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:31,589
deflect. Power up ball. What did I just do? Kill this little guy. Spare no one. All right,

122
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:38,170
I gotta block it back, right? That's pretty sick if you ask me. Oops. Holy shit, I just destroyed

123
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:53,720
that guy. Watch out, Qui-Gon. Okay, we did it. Get him, get him. Come on, little brother. Do

124
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,200
something. This is definitely a play with your little brother game and they'll do exactly what

125
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:08,180
Qui-Gon is doing right now. They just want to see the colors. Come on, get the bad guys.

126
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:29,799
Wait, what? Okay, get the bad guys. We need an R2 unit. Fuck. The blue. Swore in front of the

127
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:50,119
little brother. Oh, shit. Okay, I thought that was a clone. R2 unit. Where? Get the bad guy.

128
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:59,769
Watch out! They have shields. All right. Harry, you deal with those guys. I'll turn off- I'll do

129
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:05,779
the puzzle. Fuck. I have to deal with my little brother. If I had like actual gaming, I could

130
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:27,609
actually do it. There he is. Poxic to little brother. I need to get that blue. Got it. Oh,

131
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:37,450
yeah. Two out of 10. Fucking Mega Man energy containers. Can't wait until Kit Fisto shows up.

132
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:53,779
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking slam. That's R2 in here, right? Save R2. Shields are down. Get in. Come on,

133
00:22:53,779 --> 00:23:00,440
Qui-Gon. Nice. You got him. All right. Watch out. I'm gonna get- Oh, I'm over here. It's all right.

134
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:16,970
Get him. I'm gonna swing at him. Get him. Oh, nice job. You got him. Oh, Half-Life Alex puzzle.

135
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:24,740
You're losing studs. I'm losing studs. I'm fine. What does this thing mean?

136
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm like sucking in C3 for you. Fuck him. Whatever. Oh, put it together. What does this do?

137
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:52,650
Oh, I don't know. This is just a cool collect-a-thon, huh?

138
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:05,220
True Jedi. I'm in True Jedi. What's that mean? All right. I dropped a red one here.

139
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:22,539
Oops. I was trying to kill that guy. Okay, so we have to turn this on. I do like that it molds it.

140
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:33,420
That's pretty cool. That's really interesting. Game mechanic. Kids. Jump the fence. Wait,

141
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:46,309
see, 3PO can't make it. He's molding. What are you talking about? All right, we need a 3PO.

142
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:56,380
I don't think you can even lose. How many lives do I have? I think I just have infinite lives.

143
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:09,829
You can't lose in this game. All right, we need to turn that thing off. Where's 3PO? 3PO. 3PO,

144
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:24,069
let's go. It's the only sound effect that they keep using. They just use it every time.

145
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:41,609
Nice Lego hair. All right, I'm going. We did it. I see 3PO. What? It could be people around us.

146
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:52,660
You could have hired somebody like me to do this for like $100. Oh my God. What the fuck is all

147
00:25:52,660 --> 00:26:11,880
this? Is it all the characters? So what does True Jedi mean? I've never played them before.

148
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:24,069
Mini kit. Can I build my own stuff? There's 160 levels. Oh, I don't know what the... I feel like

149
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,509
I'm getting iPadded here where they're like giving me like unlocks and level ups to things

150
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:33,980
that mean nothing. You're a level 2 golden cube. It means fucking nothing. What is it? I don't get

151
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:52,470
it. Save game. You spend them on stuff. Really? This looks kind of fun. Wait, episode... Wait,

152
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:02,740
didn't we just see this? I can't turn the... Okay. Chapter 2, Invasion of Naboo. Wait, every single

153
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:13,980
one of these is a new movie? It's 150 movies. The Trade Federation has launched a full-scale attack

154
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,829
on the peaceful world of Naboo. Hiding aboard the landing craft, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi

155
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,950
have secretly hitched a ride with the invasion force. Now they must make contact with local

156
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:34,339
forces before it's too late. Did you get all that, Harry? Hey, Harry. How's your grilled cheese with

157
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:54,220
the custard crud off? It's good. Yeah. You're my little guy. Oh, no. I was going to just... No,

158
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:02,970
I want to be... No. All right. Wait. Yes. Oh, this is... Unlockable. Is this dinosaurs in this game?

159
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:22,869
Fake fan. I have not watched the prequel series since I was like 17, okay?

160
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,259
Look, this franchise has spanned like 50 fucking years, okay? Sorry, I don't watch these movies

161
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:41,589
start to finish every three days to keep up on who's who. I watched them when they came out like

162
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:51,740
three times and then I forgot everything. I mean, I'm going for True Jedi. Was it a camel?

163
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:03,369
That's cool. That's cute. I like that. Kids could just pick up stuff and look at things and

164
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,730
this is a good viewer's choice. Wipe the 2.5 billion dollar debt clean screen.

165
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:33,609
You know, I agree. Oh, Jar Jar. Jar Jar fight? Oh, none of that. Okay, never mind.

166
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:54,549
Fake fan. I just saw him run across. I don't know. No, Jar Jar does fight though, doesn't he?

167
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:02,579
Like actually like combat, right? What's wrong with the two? Oh, that was a big explosion. Get

168
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:13,640
those balls. Somebody just asked why is he doing this? Well, first of all, excuse me. This game's

169
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,480
like a classic and two, I was forced to to pay off a two and a half billion dollar debt to the chat.

170
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:44,809
He's gonna get run over. A wheel just like runs over Qui-Gon's head. I'm sorry. This is like a

171
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:51,819
kids game. Kids might find this stream. You think about that? This is a mature content warning

172
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:59,720
before you click on this. Why? Let go Star Wars. Just want to let you know that this is,

173
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:17,289
I could be fucked up. Um, how again? Oh, not family friendly. He can jump really high.

174
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:35,049
Do I have a lightsaber or a blaster or something? Oh, missed what? I missed something. Is he

175
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:45,240
force powers? Oh, no, it's not force sensitive. Don't worry. I am. Wait, didn't get the jewels.

176
00:31:45,880 --> 00:32:02,579
It's a weird camera change. Okay, let's go. Yeah, he can jump higher, can't he?

177
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:16,059
Holy shit. All right, let's go. Miss something stream. Do you really care? It doesn't matter.

178
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:23,529
Oh, come here. Get up here. I want to use your jump ability to get these. Yeah, a lot.

179
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:33,099
Play the game or don't play it. There's a difference between play the game and collect

180
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:46,470
every object in the game. Come on. Come on. Only bounty hunters can access these areas.

181
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,000
Wait, force grab. We got a force. I got a force grab this. Something in there.

182
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:07,130
Yep. Only bounty hunters can access this. That's fine. One stud is one dollar from the debt.

183
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,569
All right. All right. Fine. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good.

184
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:19,690
Good idea. Yeah, sure. That's a good idea. Yeah. I'm going to collect all of these fucking things.

185
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:26,500
I'm going to get like a billion. Oh, shoot. I'm good. I'm going to parry.

186
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:39,180
Why does he put the lightsaber away? No, I need that. I need that money. I need that money.

187
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:48,069
What the fuck is it doing? Stop spawning me. No, I need this money. Stop. Stop. I'm serious.

188
00:33:48,069 --> 00:34:07,849
Okay. Switch bodies. What the hell was that? All right. I get every stud is one dollar paid

189
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:14,900
off of the debt. Come on. Hurry up. I need a lightsaber user. Come on. I need a saber user.

190
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:29,349
All right. Nice. 12. What is it? It was 12,000. Every 10K is one. Every 10K is one sub.

191
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:38,170
Excuse me? No, it's every stud is one dollar off of the fucking German national debt counter.

192
00:34:38,969 --> 00:35:05,900
Lock it. Why am I not playing in co-op? I don't know. I didn't even know that existed. All right.

193
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:17,269
Let's go. Collect everything. Press F2. No. Sick. All right. The blue ones are the ones I really want

194
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:36,710
to get. I think this is like the local only. He hates Legos. I don't hate Legos. I just hate

195
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:51,590
everything they stand for. Watch this. Sick. All right. Counter's going up. That's all I care about

196
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,960
this stream. First it was, oh wow, I'm going to play Lego Star Wars. Now it's like, let's pay

197
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:15,699
that debt down. Oh yeah. Let's go. He hates capitalism. I told you that. I want to switch

198
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:30,820
to this guy. All right. Now move the rocks. Somebody squeeze in here. Oh shit. Hold on.

199
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:39,190
There's got to be a way I can jump up there, right? So you love capitalism.

200
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:57,880
Oh, what are you? There we are. Gold one. Sick. Somebody's gave me $50.

201
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:06,420
5,000 bits from the Zack Zuck IRL. Thank you for the 5,000 bits.

202
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:15,539
And they say that's $50. German national debt alert. Your debt may only be abolished if you

203
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,739
give us the one thing we want. The one thing we need, we need the German's dump truck ass emote.

204
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,260
You promised us five new emotes within a week. One must be the rockin' badonkadonk. Pay that

205
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:34,780
debt. Pay the debt. Okay. If I have a German like thick ass emote, that is a, that is a full

206
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,170
one and a half billion dollars taken off the debt. That is no, that is, that is two billion

207
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:50,230
dollars taken off the debt. And then I only owe 500 million. Well, and we'll hold on. Whatever,

208
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,869
whatever we have here. Is that a deal? All right. Well, first of all, I need like,

209
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,059
I gotta make sure I can even do that. Imagine compromising with like a chatroom about not

210
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,380
wanting to pay two and a half billion dollars. So you'll have a doctored footage image of your

211
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,179
fucking thick, huge ass that they can share and spam as a compromise. What the hell is happening?

212
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:22,860
What is going, what is this? How did I get here? I was playing, I was playing Noita last night.

213
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:28,010
What happened? All right. I gotta put this, I gotta put the thing together. There's that piece.

214
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:37,030
There's the belly. There's the head. Head on. All right. Ah, that's not it. Hold on. Take,

215
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:47,510
get, move that. Get that off. These are the legs. Move that. Where's my little brother to kill these

216
00:38:47,510 --> 00:39:15,780
guys? Get these guys. Did I fuck it up? No. Take it off. Take that off. Fight. Fight. No, I don't

217
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:33,210
want to lose money. Why is that a flower from? No. Yes. So what are these cams is actually worth?

218
00:39:37,980 --> 00:40:04,380
Oh, oh. What about your filters on that? And I'm available. All right. I'm taking over.

219
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:14,230
25,000 bucks dropped. The worst noise. Um, I can't click links right now with guys. This is like a

220
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:28,150
crash the game if I alt tab game. I can't, I can't do it. Not yet. Oh, this is the guy that goes.

221
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:38,780
All right. I will do this. Cutscenes in the frame in the name of anime surprised noises.

222
00:40:44,789 --> 00:41:00,699
Next. Jar Jar Pinks. True Jedi. Didn't get true Jedi. Look at that stud total. That's

223
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:20,469
$60,000 off the German national debt. And I made an airplane. Not even close to two and a half billion.

224
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:33,750
Um, when I, I've done it, done with the game. Fake Jedi. Fine.

225
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,179
You're not going to get 500 million either. You don't know that. Hold on.

226
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:54,150
Only level three gold block. Omega level chapter three, the Phantom Menace escape from Naboo

227
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,539
dump truck emote. Oh, look, I have to like contact my like Twitch person and say, Hey, can I,

228
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:06,579
is it okay if I put like a doctored picture of my big fat, thick fucking ass for an emote?

229
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:14,869
I can't wait to get in an immediate within 24 hour. No reply. Um, we're escaping from Naboo

230
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:24,360
and there's people that are attacking us. Oh, this is the battle. Uh, this is going to be like

231
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:44,630
battlefront, right? It's going to end up as a global emote. That would be strange. Did they

232
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:52,170
both have brown capes? All right. Sometimes it looks off here with these suits. Did we both

233
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:57,369
order our Halloween costumes from like the party store? Like we both got the Star Wars Jedi costume.

234
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:20,019
Ooh, this level. Wait, like, can I be, who could I be? Oh, I love when there's like a

235
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:24,659
rocket launcher involved. How do you aim? All right. I like this. I like this character.

236
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:46,329
It's my favorite character so far. All right. I thought those were enemies. Come on, shoot him.

237
00:43:46,889 --> 00:44:00,650
Come on. Stop hitting the lip. What the fuck? This is Padme. It's Queen Amidala. Oh, she has

238
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:11,019
a shooter too. I can't hit him. Blaster characters can grapple to other areas. Stand on the red

239
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:19,739
circles press B. Wait, I need as much money as I can get. Can't hit enemies directly. They'll

240
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:27,239
make a lot. Just wait a minute. I'm, I'm a little busy trying to collect as much national debt as I

241
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:40,500
can here. Press B right now. No, you have to be in the circle. Look. Wait, I can't, wait, can I force

242
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,909
push these? I can force shoot them. I need to get true Jedi on all these levels so I can

243
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:54,820
put the national debt down a little. This is going to be a real boring snooze fest of a stream.

244
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:11,980
Guy tries to collect like a hundred million dollars in Lego coins. The blue ones are the most

245
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:18,920
important. Blue ones are worth like a thousand. All right. Only collect blue ones from now on

246
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:28,619
and gold ones and get the, get white ones if they're in the area. Wait, what's this? I can

247
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:39,269
like mess with this. Purple is the most important one. I haven't seen any purples. You can buy

248
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:46,840
multipliers and get billions easy. Oh, really? Well, it's like this national debt's only going

249
00:45:46,840 --> 00:46:16,409
to be available for a few hours. Ban that guy. No. VIP that guy. Do it. Right now. What else is in

250
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:23,019
here? What about that painting? Yeah, I need to be able to force grab it. I don't have any force

251
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:28,820
users in my party right now. You can push objects that have both black and yellow stripes. Does it

252
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:47,530
kill? Wait, you can slap people. Okay. That's more fun. Oh, puzzle. Also. Oh, I did it wrong.

253
00:46:47,530 --> 00:47:06,309
You've never played a Lego game before. No, I haven't. All right. What does that do?

254
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:25,449
I don't know what that did. I can't push it. I can't push anything else. Can I break shit? Oh,

255
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:31,820
shit. Whoa. Wait, no, no, no, no. Get coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins. And I know

256
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:42,969
people saying they're not coins. Yes, they are. That's Poland. Did I just ricochet a bullet off

257
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:54,710
of the metal and hit shoot myself on the head? What a way to go. I put this back together. Can

258
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:19,579
I not? Okay. Cool. So how do I what do I do? Any more pieces? I have to come back and free play.

259
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:24,099
You know, I'm getting real sick of that word being said, I have to come back and free play

260
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,260
whether the developers didn't design it in a way that it could be completed without doing a secondary

261
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,340
playthrough to pad the length of the video game. And you guys said this is one of your favorite

262
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:51,559
games. I'm not going to stand for that. I'm not going to stand for that one. All right. If I don't

263
00:48:52,380 --> 00:49:04,280
know, don't play with fire anymore. You'll burn the house down. Don't do it. Oh, nice music.

264
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:27,539
Double or nothing. Make it 50 billion. Oh, shit. I didn't even punch that person. He said a deal.

265
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,900
Well, you don't even know what the deal is. How could you say deal if you don't know what the deal

266
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:40,070
is? Got to come back and free play and put the windows back together. All right. Shave

267
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,190
10 million dollars off it if I do a really good fake sneeze. How's that? Does that sound good?

268
00:49:48,900 --> 00:50:10,809
No. Oh, come on. No deal. Oh, yes. I met up with the party. I get a million. Sure. One million. All

269
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:23,670
right. This is if I do a good like fake sneeze. No, I need to like a real consensus on that. I

270
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:32,489
can't just do it. No one said that. A few of you did. A handful of you did. I've got to shoot this.

271
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,260
There's one, two. There's probably another one over here. Oh, wait.

272
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:49,059
What does that do? Stand on that. Oh, shit. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, come back here.

273
00:50:49,699 --> 00:51:06,809
Why gone? Show auto? Oh, I know I could show auto for a clean like 50 million. Wait, where are they?

274
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:22,539
You can't come up here? Why can't they not come up here? I think we've come to a good compromise

275
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:40,389
of what that actually costs. We don't negotiate with criminals. Who do you negotiate with? 25

276
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:56,500
million for auto? Really? What? Really? That's it? That's an easy 100 million. Yes. What? 20?

277
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:07,380
That's it? It's got to be more than that. No, no, I don't. No, no, no. That's got to be. Okay. 50

278
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:15,750
million. How's that sound? Hit me in the middle. 20 million? What do you mean you're going down?

279
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:29,429
30 million. All right. 30 million. I want 30 million dollars shaved off the national germadette.

280
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:46,760
Deal? Got a deal. All right. All right. We got a deal. Yes, there is a current debt tracker,

281
00:52:47,480 --> 00:53:00,469
by the way. I can't believe that was made that quickly. You guys are fucking fast. We have a

282
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:05,909
deal. We have a deal. Showing auto is to erase 30 million dollars off of the national debt.

283
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:14,150
Just print more bald coin. That would be great if bald coin wasn't worthless.

284
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:31,590
By the way, it always was worthless. I created bald coin during the peak of the pumping shit

285
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:40,659
coin bubble of 2017. So you think that has any value right now? As I back in the shit

286
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:46,980
coin bubble pop of 2016, 2017, I could have had Cookie Monster as an advisor on my coin

287
00:53:46,980 --> 00:54:05,880
and people would have still bought it. Show feet for 10 million. Nope. I would rather owe forever.

288
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:14,260
10 million, dude. Really? Oh, wow. 10 million. No. That erases the whole thing and I'm never

289
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:23,500
going to do that. They're getting no compromises from me for that one. No. Get that fucking shit

290
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:31,639
at it. Nope. All right. Some of you guys in the chat right now just some playing along and you

291
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:36,920
don't really care. When I said the word like, oh, show feet. Yeah. And all of a sudden you care.

292
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,599
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, dude. You're like, that would be good. Just to clear the whole debt, man.

293
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,820
Just like, yeah, it's just like, show them though. That would like clear the whole thing. Yeah,

294
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,940
do it. Let you like, get everybody like involved and like get about like a whole campaign about

295
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:56,360
like how we get just cleared. It's funny. Some of you guys heard the word feet and then just got

296
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,400
super interested in this like little game we're playing. Dude, just as a joke.

297
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:29,719
You're just doing just as a joke. Not a game. Why am I laughing? Because it's funny.

298
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:40,789
Like you don't think that that's a little humorous. How did that do? Shortcut. Nope. I

299
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:51,210
just blew it up. What does this do? Let's investigate. It was kind of worthless.

300
00:55:51,210 --> 00:56:01,900
Really wasn't worth doing. This is a serious situation, Jeremy. Yeah. Well, hey, I got,

301
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:21,610
look, I got plenty of time to erase this debt. Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue stud. Where? It's despawned.

302
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:34,730
All right. What do you guys think a direct like fart into the microphone would be? All right. I

303
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,449
just like, like somebody with like their algorithm that like listens for the word,

304
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:44,010
like feet farts and like ass and shit. Just like, wait, I heard it. I got to join the stream.

305
00:56:53,110 --> 00:57:06,489
That's extra debt. As debt. I got my fucking audio algorithm set up.

306
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:26,139
Jeremy, you're irresponsible with money. This is, wait, I get, I need to have a blue

307
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:52,460
lightsaber hit that. What? In fucking half. That's not what this is.

308
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:12,570
No, that's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. It's not what I meant. That's not what

309
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:23,130
I meant. Oh, you guys shut up. Don't say that. What's this one? I have to be a shift Lord

310
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,190
add debt. No, you know, I'm sorry. This is nothing we have to talk about with this.

311
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:40,840
You can't just add debt. That's not how the, I can, we can take it away, but you don't, we don't add

312
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:52,139
it unless it's very clearly specified that it's been added. No, you cannot. I have to agree to

313
00:58:52,139 --> 00:59:06,019
that. Is there a fucking sprint button is interest. What's the interest rate and what's the, is it

314
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:25,900
annual? Well, how, how are you calculating interest? What's the way I, what's the APR?

315
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:35,510
2.5% per day. No, 2.5% per day of 2.5 billion is an unsurmountable amount of money that I will

316
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:55,610
never be able to erase. Oh, interest-free. That's an interest-free debt. Plus two and minus two

317
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:03,349
should decrease or increase the debt. No. Dude, do you understand how manipulated that would be?

318
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:07,610
I would never say anything funny ever again for the rest of my life.

319
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:23,110
It would use, you guys would just add it no matter what. No. I got a hundred and five thousand,

320
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:34,380
a hundred and thousand five hundred dollars. It would be 62 million dollars per day.

321
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:47,320
Oh, to the Cantina? All right, we'll after this. Moss Espapodris, Queen Amidala and her Jedi

322
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:54,599
protectors have fled Naboo heading for Ruscant. They plan to inform the Galactic Senate of the

323
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:00,440
Trade Federation invasion. However, the Royal Starship's hyperdrive is damaged in the escape

324
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,840
and they have been forced to land the remote planet of Tatooine for repairs where they will

325
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:26,460
meet their new Wizard of Oz party member, Luke Skywalker, his father, Anakin Skywalker. Hey,

326
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:36,070
Apollo 900 just gave fifty dollars. Thanks to the five thousand bits, add a deal and no deal emote

327
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:45,559
for a hundred million. No, that's not going to consume the stream. Oh, it's this guy. What's

328
01:01:45,559 --> 01:02:08,039
his name? Oh, Waldo. Yeah. Right. What's his name? Watto. Oh, that, what's that guy's name?

329
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:23,019
Bulba. It's Bulbus, right? It's a Bulba. Jesus Christ. How do I drive? Does it just drive

330
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:55,050
automatically? How do I jump? Can I jump? Oh my God, this is too fast. Go, go, go, go, go, go,

331
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:22,789
go, go. Now this is uh, debasing. What place am I in? I don't know what that means. I have like two,

332
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:29,800
I have like two stars. Two out of three stars. Are the cops coming? Bad joke. Hey,

333
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:46,840
add it to the deck, motherfucker. How do I get over there? Oh, right. I have to go in front of

334
01:03:46,840 --> 01:04:16,150
Subalba. Well, there's more than can't die. Oh, right on your ass, Subalba. Where's my like laser

335
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:42,460
shooters? Come here. No. What was the point of that? It's just Subalba and Anakin Skywalker.

336
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:55,610
When will he take the lead? Okay. You know when you're going really fast in a game or something

337
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:59,369
and you realize just how fast the sides of the screen are going and it makes you almost want

338
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:17,179
to throw up like instantly. That's happening right now. Oh, Subalba. How are you? Past. First

339
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:32,460
try. First try and a good load of money. Come on. Dead. I don't know why I thought that was,

340
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:40,309
he just looked like Dexter from Dexter's lab for a second. That's $500 taken down from the debt.

341
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:58,579
Why does R2 look like somebody put painter's tape all over him, spray painted him, took the

342
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:14,579
tape off and didn't add the detail work? No true Jedi? Oh, I'll take another $130,000 though.

343
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:37,139
Odd champ. What is the building? Oh, that's Subalba's car. All right. Somebody said go back to the

344
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:43,619
cantina. I can buy stuff at the cantina with, I'm not buying anything. I don't want anything.

345
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:51,820
I need to, this is money I have to save to deposit into the, yeah, I'm not buying anything.

346
01:06:52,460 --> 01:07:05,429
If I buy something, then I lose it from the national debt. Oh, ice cream. Buy the multiplier.

347
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:10,340
Not a bad idea. Smart guy. It sounded like condescending, but it really wasn't supposed to

348
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:30,860
be. What do I buy stuff? Ooh, put this puzzle together and I get extra money. Thank you. Stop

349
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:41,880
helping him. Stop helping him. Go buy new characters. You can buy new characters? Wait,

350
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,000
if Yoda's available, then I don't care. I'll blow up this whole national debt for this.

351
01:07:45,719 --> 01:08:02,889
What do I buy stuff? Oh, okay. Right here. 3.8%. What's this timer going? Hints. Characters.

352
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:09,989
Extras. Enter code. Gold brick story clips. Oh, no. I don't want this.

353
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:24,229
Extras. Extra toggle. Fertilizer. Disguise. Chewbacca carrying C-3PO. I don't know what

354
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:33,989
the, what is this? Characters. Bonk droid. PK droid. Battle droid. Battle droid, I want a battle droid.

355
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:46,649
Droideka. Captain Tar Pals. Boss Nass. Royal Guard. Padme. Watto. Does it sound like?

356
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:56,100
Watto. The rest of these are locked. Get gonk? All right, I got gonk. Stop spending money. All right,

357
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:07,260
hold on. Hints. Double jump and press X when in the air to do a special attack. All right,

358
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:23,399
what do I do? How do I buy the extra, how do I buy the multiplier? Where is it? Is it code?

359
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:36,039
Okay, hold on. How many letters here? One, two, three, four, six letters. Uh, Han Solo, like

360
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:41,720
Chewbacca. Um, like Luke. Saber, like lightsaber. It's gonna be some stupid Star Wars word. Um,

361
01:09:42,520 --> 01:10:03,340
like a country or a planet. Um, Lando. Lando. Lando's gonna be one, right? Like Lando. L-A-N-D-O-E?

362
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:20,470
Or is it D-O? Lando. Whatever. Gold bricks. Wait, I can buy gold bricks? What's, why, what's the

363
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:37,479
point of this? What could I do with gold bricks? Buy them. But what do they do? It's fertilizer.

364
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:50,630
Invest, invest, invest. All right. Gold brick two. Okay, I got two gold bricks. And I'm gonna get

365
01:10:50,630 --> 01:11:13,609
the disguise. All right, I got disguise. What do I put it on? Disguise on. Adaptive difficulty is on.

366
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:35,579
I don't even know what that means. Please read chat. VXZ123 is the code. That's cheating though.

367
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,970
That's cheating. Yeah, that's cheating. I can't do that. Look, if I can unlock it with money,

368
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:51,670
okay, but that's purely, that's pure cheating. I just like fucking executed that guy. Um,

369
01:11:52,470 --> 01:12:09,319
all right, let's go to episode one. The Phantom Menace. Oh shit. Wait, no, this is my friend.

370
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:23,420
Pick him up. That's my, like, cube friend. Oh, he's gone. How many levels? Dude, I'm almost at the

371
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:30,279
end of the Phantom Menace. Let's go. You just airlocked that guy. He's fine.

372
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:53,029
Retake Theed Palace. Sure, I already know how the movie goes.

373
01:12:53,750 --> 01:13:17,699
That's Earth. That's Texas. Oh, how come only one of the, one of those guys had it on?

374
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:27,430
All right, this is where they have the big Harry Potter shield and they throw those like

375
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:41,289
ball liquid slingshots at people. Oh, big battle. Why do they have disguises on their bow?

376
01:13:51,420 --> 01:14:11,140
Looks like somebody was on the comedy tab in Pornhub. Okay, we have the comedy section here

377
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:33,350
where they put like disguises on their like penis. What possible context would that joke be in?

378
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:39,109
Those guys had the fucking, the nose and the mustache like on their crotch.

379
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:59,670
What are you talking about? The droids. The droids. I'm talking about the droids.

380
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:10,170
Oh, that's right. This is a kid's game. What I meant to say was uh,

381
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:20,600
I don't want to get any like parents to write me any letters.

382
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:44,460
So hard to add it. He's lost his mind. No, you lost your mind. Oh, R2.

383
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:03,859
You are high. I know it. You don't know anything. You don't know. You don't know anything about me.

384
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:16,520
Okay, you know, Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from Point Blank. This is Dr. Don. Small characters can

385
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:27,180
crawl through access hatches. Go in it. Press B. He is small. He can't, why can't, go on and get in there.

386
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:56,489
Small characters can crawl through the access. All right, well, let's go.

387
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:05,300
How are you smaller than him? How are you smaller than him? He's the smallest thing here.

388
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:40,579
Do something. Look at the guy with the gun. Somebody shoot somebody.

389
01:17:40,579 --> 01:17:55,159
All right, we all have to stand on one. Nope. We need to, wait, what?

390
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:02,600
Was the, who, I can't, I'm not gonna say that. Was that joke worth it?

391
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:13,850
Um, hold on. I need to be somebody that shoots. All right, now somebody stand on that.

392
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:24,390
Oh, shit, it's gonna be a million. There it is. Do an, okay, acting challenge. R2D2 dying. Easy.

393
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:54,340
I think that deserves at least 10 million shaved off the national debt. Don't you think? No deal.

394
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:04,090
By the way, I had to turn and yell that into the wall because if I had done that sitting straight

395
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:28,039
in front of the microphone, a lot of you would have been injured. Honey, why did you cast your

396
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:36,119
ballot? What? I don't only have 3000 gold coins. This is stupid. Get that picture of Superman out

397
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:53,659
of here. If you peek the mic, how much? Wait, peek the mic does what? Please take a look at some of

398
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:58,060
the links. All right, I will take a moment to look at some of the links. Hopefully the game doesn't

399
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:05,100
fucking crash. 100 million to peek the mic. No, that's not worth it. I'll break, I'll break

400
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:20,489
something. Yeah, the debt counter. Right. I've seen it. What is this? New footage from Star Wars

401
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:32,779
DMCA movie? This person just made this account. This person has one follower. They just like made

402
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:41,300
this account. What do you want? What are you doing? It's wrong. It's not okay. Let's, this is

403
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:48,630
scariest fucking thing I've seen all day. I don't know. Is this a real picture? Not a real picture,

404
01:20:48,630 --> 01:21:01,859
but what is this? Not a real picture, but is this a picture of somebody or is this a picture of me

405
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:19,640
that somebody fucked with? I can't even tell. All right, give me the next one. I mean, this one,

406
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,079
I mean, that's just, that's Watto, but it's just my, it's the thing face.

407
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:36,229
It sort of just looks like there's a brain-eating slug just pressed up into my nose, sucking my

408
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:48,420
brain out of my nose. What else you got? What about the GIF? No, fuck that GIF. I'm gonna put it on.

409
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:55,380
That's what you want. That's not what you're getting. Joe, you're a coward.

410
01:21:55,859 --> 01:22:08,390
I can't. I get, no, I don't want. I can't. I can't. Dude, what the fuck?

411
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:53,140
Emote, emote, emote, a hundred million to show it. What? For real? Leave it on stream. No,

412
01:22:53,960 --> 01:23:13,189
absolutely not. It was worth it. Deal is off. I showed it. This is good too. Hold on.

413
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:32,460
This is good too. 30 million for only the dogs. Sorry, but without the emote on the table,

414
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:41,300
I can't accept. I'm out. But wait, you forgot to say that you would do like in perpetuity a loan

415
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,939
to me, which then I have to pay back over the course of like four or five years. And then you

416
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:53,159
get a 1% royalty on every single time I ever show a picture of the dog. His deals, nobody ever takes

417
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:57,699
his deals, by the way. He's just there to kind of be in the middle and just say strange things.

418
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:03,659
No one ever takes Kevin's deals. Why can't he just say, I'll give you $200,000? Why is it always like,

419
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:08,380
I'll give you 75,000. But then I want in perpetuity royalties on top of 5% of every sale you make.

420
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,930
It's just, dude, just give him $75,000 and just fucking be done with it. I just don't think he

421
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:24,329
ever wants to give any money. I think he just likes to be in on the show as business. All right,

422
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:32,979
last one. Then we're going to go Barbara. I love how you like know who these are. Like these

423
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:42,680
characters. This is unrelated to the things we're talking about right now, but it's, I mean, kind of

424
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:59,210
funny. Tank. Deal 4 damage. Corrupt. Then deal 2 damage to all enemy minions. What is corrupt?

425
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:10,710
Wait, this is a real card? Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. I'll take, I'll take $100 million off.

426
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:27,609
That's a real card. All right, let's continue playing. Star Wars. Revenge of the Phantom Sith.

427
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:58,789
All right, we need R2. R2. Wait, he can shoot? R2, auto D2. Wait, are we keeping track of how

428
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:04,220
much the debt is actually being paid down? I just did, no, okay. I screamed really loud and it was

429
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:16,970
what? 10, 20 million? What was it worth? I'm gonna keep track of that. What was it? It was 20. It was

430
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:31,109
20. Do a monkey noise for another 10. That needs to be confirmed first. That's, I'm getting a lot

431
01:26:31,109 --> 01:26:43,979
of no deals, so I'm not going to do that unless it's a deal. No, I'm not seeing very many deals

432
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:55,239
here. Shit, I just got shot in the air. Hit me! Don't let them all go to waste. You know, if any

433
01:26:55,239 --> 01:27:04,439
other character would do anything, it would be great. Irma is dummy thick. Thanks for the

434
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:17,420
five community subs. You know, it's funny too. I've gained like 20 pounds. It's definitely gotten

435
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:29,659
way bigger. Oh my god, can I play the fucking game for a second? Just reflect. Reflect.

436
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:40,229
Fuck the fuck, dude. I'm out of money. All right, just who cares about the fountains? It's like $20.

437
01:27:41,859 --> 01:27:48,680
Actually mad. Just stand in the middle of everybody and like it'll hit the other people.

438
01:27:49,399 --> 01:28:09,930
Hit it!

439
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:20,710
My favorite part of that song, by the way. And it goes...

440
01:28:26,489 --> 01:28:36,649
I always like fucking nod the fuck out when I see that. What if the active debt counter has a

441
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:47,500
thermometer on the screen? All right, we need someone to crawl through this. You. Come here.

442
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:57,880
Crawl through that. I go open the door. Oh shit, the only thing I had to do the whole game.

443
01:29:00,979 --> 01:29:09,989
Did I do it, Obi-Wan? Did I make you proud? Surprise, Ruby. Thanks for the five community subs.

444
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:20,199
Thanks, dude. Oh, this is Anakin Skywalker. He's huge. Don't you think he would be like

445
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:36,619
three feet tall? Why is he like six feet tall? He's seven. Yeah, and Obi-Wan's like 45.

446
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:57,779
Why is he as tall as Obi-Wan? The debt, the debt, the debt. What about it?

447
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:10,859
What do you want about it? Crunchies. Stop growing at 15. What are you talking about?

448
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:21,180
The debt, the debt. I was trying to double jump across the chasm. I guess I can't do that.

449
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:38,890
Open. Open. Oh, I need a little guy. Little guy. Are you little enough for this?

450
01:30:39,689 --> 01:30:51,560
Of course not. I need a little guy. Little guy. Link. Hold on. Not yet.

451
01:30:52,359 --> 01:31:07,939
Try to just reflect. Thank you. This is a bad deal. What's a bad deal? I didn't make any deals.

452
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:11,060
Pay debt. I didn't make. What deal did I make? What are you talking about? What's going on?

453
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:37,239
Wait. Okay. Hold on. It's bad. This link sucks. Is it? Okay. Hello, Dermot. We are treasurers

454
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:41,960
of the great Dermot95 sub debt. Our terms are as follows. Show Otto for minimum one clip

455
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:49,020
worth of content is 20 million. Okay. Play TF2 on stream. 350 million. I'm not doing that one.

456
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:54,659
Play Doki Doki Literature Club on stream. That's 1.75 billion. You had your chance this afternoon.

457
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:59,699
Funny faces and sounds only stream for a minimum of 30 minutes. The debt is erased.

458
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:12,100
Wait. What? Funny faces and sounds for 30 minutes means it's all erased. Make Dermot Dump Truck a

459
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:28,420
four-part emote like Joop is 1 billion. And then the rest cut off. Okay. Well, let's keep track of

460
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:45,340
what we have known right now. I'm at 20 million resolved. Yes. That was for the R2-D2 scream.

461
01:32:45,340 --> 01:33:02,729
That was part of the deal. There was no deal. Yes, there was. Yes, there was. There was a deal there.

462
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:10,550
I want you to go back and watch that. There was a deal. All right. I need to get everybody across

463
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:37,289
the bridge. Where's the little guy? Where the fuck is Anakin? He bailed. What? I mean, he bailed.

464
01:33:37,930 --> 01:34:01,399
Oh, they're all down here. All right. Let's go. Anakin. You. Who the fuck is this? Oh.

465
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:16,569
Can't double jump. Is there a staircase that I'm missing? Stairs. Stairs. Stairs. Just hold on.

466
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:24,539
Let me just take a sip of my coffee. Where are these magic stairs you're talking about? Oh.

467
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:37,609
Hey, Pronovar rocks. Thanks for the 10 community subs. A lot of subs today. Thanks, guys. Thanks for

468
01:34:37,609 --> 01:34:45,720
the subs. I'm going to be enjoying a nice sub sandwich later. I don't know. What's your guys

469
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:55,449
favorite sandwich? This is multi-level marketing. What did I do? I didn't do any multi-level

470
01:34:55,449 --> 01:35:05,850
marketing anymore. Taco Bell is not a sub. Surprise Ruby. Another five subs. Thanks.

471
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:22,460
Surprise Ruby. What is Jersey Mike's? I don't know. Jersey Mike's turkey sub with mayo. Damn.

472
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:27,449
You got my attention. You actually do have my attention. You really do.

473
01:35:31,909 --> 01:35:40,340
You have it. How do I swap? I guess you could just, dude, kill Anakin and you get to swap.

474
01:35:40,340 --> 01:36:04,500
No, you don't. Let's go. Can I swap? Oh, that was of noise. That's worth a few bucks.

475
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:27,000
All right. Attack. Stones. Stones. Yes, sir. How? Get the stones. Stones. Yes, sir. How?

476
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:40,680
Get those stones. What is that from? What is that? Stones. What is that? From this stream?

477
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:52,760
That's from the fifth element. Oh, right. Yeah, it is. And it's Gary Oldman. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

478
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:18,039
I got it. It's my favorite childhood game. Collect. Collect. Anybody else jump high?

479
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:46,949
Wait a minute. Crafting. Anakin. It's not a vent? Sure. Okay. Hold on. I need to have somebody stand

480
01:37:46,949 --> 01:37:58,760
on that and then this is a co-op thing. I'm not making an Among Us joke. No, you're not going to

481
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:07,670
get that out of me today. I don't even care. Stand on it. Oh, I'm over it. I'm over that.

482
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:28,039
Aren't you? Why is he doing that? Of course. He made it and I didn't. Fuck. When they jumped

483
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:30,920
together, I thought they were the same. Like, they blended together. They have the same fucking

484
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:53,239
Halloween costume on. Vent. Free money. All of you. Remember, they don't celebrate Halloween in

485
01:38:53,239 --> 01:38:57,699
space. Now you're going to next see something they don't celebrate Christmas or Thanksgiving

486
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:07,770
or like New Year's. There's a version of it. We have to get everybody up here.

487
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:20,300
And everybody pulls like the Warcraft. There's like a feast of winter time. The winter's feast.

488
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:30,500
It's Christmas. You know what I mean? A feast of winter veil. Yeah. If there's no like

489
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:34,260
Christmas or like Hanukkah or whatever in space, then they'll make their own one up.

490
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:46,420
What is this? Mayonnaise. Why is there a mayonnaise emote? Who has a mayo emote?

491
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:59,189
And why are there not enough people up here? Get up here. Who didn't come up with us? Whatever.

492
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:11,770
I have to make the path for them. Ah, fuck. Somebody else will do it.

493
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:30,619
I did it. What's an actual good deal? Make the path for everybody.

494
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:38,840
Right? I gotta... Neopets for a hundred million. All right. Somebody... I was going to do Neopets

495
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,359
before we did the insanity. Somebody said that like my credit card information is going to get

496
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:47,239
stolen. What does that mean? Somebody said like, don't like... Neopets is like a not even secure

497
01:40:47,239 --> 01:41:07,560
like HTTPS website. Like what does that mean? Help me. Is that fake? Is this false? A lot of

498
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:23,510
money. What happened to me? Oh, it exploded. He's just a Neopet hater. I never played it.

499
01:41:24,069 --> 01:41:36,260
All right. So can I get everybody up here now? Play Toontown. Oh my God. How do I open that?

500
01:41:36,899 --> 01:41:43,670
How do we get everybody up here? Is this like a magic thing I have to do?

501
01:41:48,329 --> 01:42:00,329
Please play Toontown. Please play Toontown. Break the flowers.

502
01:42:00,329 --> 01:42:08,739
Well, that's a weed, but almost an MMO shit show part two and never did it.

503
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:15,939
Yeah, you're right. I did. Yeah, you're right. I did. Oh my God. That's what I had to do.

504
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:34,920
All right, Qui-Gon. Let's get up there. Get on it. We've proposed a new offer.

505
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,020
No, hold on. Let me like, let me just get to the end of this level. I'm almost done with the

506
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:53,989
Phantom Menace. Link, hold on. I'm almost done with the Phantom Menace. Wait, you're distracting me.

507
01:42:54,710 --> 01:43:06,220
Switch sides. Eat a spoon of mayo. Or wait, does that work? Is that for real?

508
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:13,270
Is that an actual part of the deal? I tried to double jump and it didn't work.

509
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:17,029
I literally, I literally pressed double jump and it didn't do anything.

510
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,520
Stop.

511
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,569
Depth perception. I'm jumping in the perfect angle.

512
01:43:49,689 --> 01:43:58,550
Perfect angle. All right, let's go. Well, everyone was waiting for me.

513
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:04,229
Yeah, I took the long way back. Sorry, guys. I know you wanted to pull the next mob,

514
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:08,470
but I got lost in the instance. That's another wild joke. I'll take a fucking plus two, please.

515
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:20,170
For a good wild joke, that's, I mean, that's at least $50,000 off, right?

516
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:54,300
Something like that. Begging. Mutants! Mutants! How do I sprint? Somebody said this is a way to

517
01:44:54,300 --> 01:45:07,029
sprint, right? Oh, by the way, that Star Wars VR game that's coming out, is that an actual

518
01:45:07,029 --> 01:45:13,689
lightsaber fight? Somebody finally made that fucking game. I cannot believe out of everything

519
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:20,789
we've ever seen in VR. No, they didn't make a VR game. A lightsaber. What would, what would,

520
01:45:20,789 --> 01:45:30,300
what could you possibly be thinking? It's all space combat. I don't understand. You have the

521
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:37,500
perfect opportunity to have a lightsaber one-to-one thing that everybody has wanted for a decade.

522
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:53,260
A decade. And you're gonna make a space combat simulator? No. Blade and Sorcery. But Blade and

523
01:45:53,260 --> 01:46:02,300
Sorcery is just a fun little way, and I'm talking about like a Jedi lightsaber Lucas Film co-sponsored

524
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:15,829
video game where you play as a Jedi with the one-to-one lightsaber. We have that already.

525
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:26,250
We do not have that already. I mean, we have that already. No, we don't. Star Wars Connect.

526
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:35,750
That's not even close to what I'm talking about. Vader Immortal. I don't, I feel like you made

527
01:46:35,750 --> 01:47:02,779
that up. What is Vader Immortal? Vader Immortal. How do I get up here? It's an Oculus game. Can I

528
01:47:02,779 --> 01:47:21,020
do anything up here to open this? It's real. Break the chairs. That's good money. Did you even read

529
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:42,520
the tutorial? There was no tutorial. Or Scrapple. Is there any more stuff? Table. I just joked.

530
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:51,050
I just joked R2-D2 for no reason. Wait, that's a red brick. What's a red brick do? That's gotta be

531
01:47:51,050 --> 01:48:19,420
worth some money. So what the hell? I need a third table. The gray tracing floors. They actually look

532
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:38,199
really good. Oh, wait. I just rearranged the furniture. It didn't do anything. That doesn't

533
01:48:38,199 --> 01:48:51,109
help me. That link. Hold on. That link, that link, that link, that link. That's a scary link.

534
01:49:06,069 --> 01:49:13,529
And you have new terms. Let me see them. Hellman's extra heavy mayonnaise.

535
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:26,439
Wait, there's an extra heavy mayonnaise? What is extra heavy? Is this, that's not a real product?

536
01:49:26,439 --> 01:49:34,569
Extra heavy mayonnaise? Hellman's extra heavy. Eat the whole thing on stream for one billion off.

537
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:46,699
I'm not, I'm not going to do that. What is extra heavy? That sounds gross. Here's better terms.

538
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:58,579
Okay, real deal. Let's see what this one says. Real deal. Dump truck ass emote. TF2 stream.

539
01:49:58,579 --> 01:50:18,329
Four additional emotes. Get erased when all is fulfilled. Hmm. I don't know. I don't know. Some

540
01:50:18,329 --> 01:50:26,199
of those, at least one or two of those things, I'm not so sure about. You never stated it had

541
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:33,659
to be a four-part ass emote. You guys are gonna get me fucking banned. I'm gonna get dropped from

542
01:50:33,659 --> 01:51:00,100
Twitch TV. It'll be worth it. Take the risk. Why would I take that risk? Four-part like mega ass

543
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:06,979
emote. Might, you know why that, here's why I, it's nothing about me getting banned. Here's why I

544
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:12,500
don't think that's a good idea. Because you will, you guys will go to whatever other streamers that

545
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:18,260
you watch. Whether it's, you know, this person, that person. You are going to four-part thick

546
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:23,220
germa ass emote and fuck up their stream and they're going to be really annoyed that there's

547
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:28,420
just an ass, a huge thick ass that keeps showing up and that they can't stop it and they can't turn

548
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:32,859
it off. You're gonna start, you're gonna start getting banned. You're gonna start getting like

549
01:51:32,859 --> 01:51:36,300
timed out in other streamers chats and then they're gonna come back to me and they're gonna be like,

550
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:41,340
dude, did you make like a four-part huge like thick booty ass, huge ass emote? And I'm gonna

551
01:51:41,340 --> 01:52:00,899
have to say yes. I'm gonna have to explain myself to all the people that I annoy. Watch out rollers.

552
01:52:05,079 --> 01:52:10,600
This really is just multi-boxing. I'm just trying to, I signed up for like refer a friend like 12

553
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:16,840
times. So we have like a six million percent increase in experience. You're just gonna start

554
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:24,600
seeing randomly gold particle effects. Just fly around each individual one of these people

555
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:47,689
at random times. Dear Mr. Dump Truck. That's, hey, that's Dr. Dump Truck to you.

556
01:52:48,489 --> 01:53:04,779
Hellman's real extra thick male is, I can't read it. You guys are going too fast. I can't,

557
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:15,750
I don't know what you're doing. I can't read it. Oh, R2 can't make it. Dr. Dump, Dr. Dump Truck

558
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:24,649
could be in the rumble. Yeah, maybe if it was WWE 2k13 or 14 because then I could just have like

559
01:53:24,649 --> 01:53:37,050
the ass speed, the slider that's all the way to the end and everything else is tiny. I have this

560
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:40,729
too. All right, you know what's confusing me as well? They all have the mustache on. So I,

561
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:47,609
it's hard to, they're all the same person. I thought, I don't even know who that,

562
01:53:48,569 --> 01:54:07,260
these are all the same. Who are these people? It's all like different Marios. Ooh, shake it.

563
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:18,220
By the way, this, we're almost like done with the Phantom Menace of the complete saga.

564
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:49,779
Who the hell is Darth Maul? He didn't show up once. He's up your ass. All right. That's such

565
01:54:49,779 --> 01:54:59,539
an old drunk fucking fat guy thing to say. Anybody seen, anybody seen my glasses? Yeah.

566
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:06,659
Yeah, they're up your ass. They're up your ass. Have you checked up your ass?

567
01:55:07,779 --> 01:55:50,300
No, I haven't. Up your ass, Andy. Quiet. Mario. Mario. Shake it up and you get the goods inside.

568
01:55:50,539 --> 01:56:06,520
Okay. Stop crack Mario. How's that crack Mario? Can't hit these bricks. All right.

569
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:23,430
We're all about the links the last few days, aren't we? Tons of crack links coming in more

570
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:38,310
than usual. There's tons of just crack links. Who can get up there? You guys get up here.

571
01:56:38,869 --> 01:56:54,899
Who can jump this? Nobody can. There's one guy making all these bad links. One man link spammer.

572
01:56:54,899 --> 01:57:03,850
Is that what you're saying? Didn't I save these guys? I saved these two. All right. I got to

573
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:27,260
save the rest of them. One man spam. Got it. Okay. So now, now what we're going to do chat.

574
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:37,029
Okay. So, hey chat, here's what we're going to do. All right. Get on this. I'll get on this one. Okay.

575
01:57:37,029 --> 01:57:43,619
So chat. Here's what we're going to do. Chat. I've seen this before. You guys don't like being

576
01:57:43,619 --> 01:58:01,180
just called like a chat, right? What do you like to be called? Germamites? By the way, people get

577
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:06,220
annoyed when they find out that that's what I call this community. Well, what's the community? The

578
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:15,060
germs? The germas? Like the clowns? No, the germamites. And they go, fuck that. Fuck that.

579
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:20,810
Don't tell me how to run my community. First of all, second of all, that's what that's what it is.

580
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:36,439
How dare you tell me to run my community? Paul. Everyone right now is fucking searching for like

581
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:40,460
the streamer or the YouTuber whose name is Paul. Who's he talking about? Who's he talking about?

582
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:46,199
Who is that? Who's Paul? I wonder who that is. Who's he? Who's he? Who's he? Who's he? Who's he?

583
01:58:46,199 --> 01:59:07,739
Hey, Paul. You're an idiot. This has got to go first. Place it. Place it. Pull it. Pop it.

584
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:35,289
Twist it. R2D2 sound. Gotta collect every coin. Every single coin. I will not part with one

585
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:51,210
single coin. Not one. Trinket. Oh, little thief. Oh, you're so magnificent. The stories they tell

586
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:56,329
us surely are immountable and insurmountable to you, most smog the powerful.

587
01:59:57,130 --> 02:00:08,340
Is that what they say? Thief. I almost want you to take it. If I can see it, eat him aside.

588
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:15,539
To watch his very bright brain. I haven't seen the movie in a very long time. I tried.

589
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:34,229
The take they leave in. Come on, break it. What is this? How can I not open this?

590
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:45,619
I just walked off the edge. Alright, let's go. Come on. Go. Where's Darth Maul? Why didn't I

591
02:00:45,619 --> 02:00:53,899
play Lego Lord of the Rings? Wait. Wait, where's this last person? Where's this last hostage?

592
02:00:56,659 --> 02:01:06,199
What's cool in Lord of the Rings? This is plus a full letter grade. Yeah, this is plus a full

593
02:01:06,199 --> 02:01:23,020
letter grade. What are you doing then? Be free. Is somebody just holding a gun? I thought I was

594
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:27,659
going to die. Is somebody just holding a gun to one of the hostages somewhere? This is watching

595
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:51,979
this. It's like, where is he? Where is he? Oh, down? No, he's up above the entrance. Wait,

596
02:01:51,979 --> 02:02:00,890
I get this person to jump over here? Wait, wait, wait, wait. He's all the way back. I need to sprint.

597
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:08,220
How much for ASCAM? Zero. But no, seriously, what's better Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?

598
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:24,979
That's a tough one. Lord of the Rings or Star Wars? What's better? Well, Lord of the Rings is

599
02:02:24,979 --> 02:02:34,569
probably... This is actually kind of hard. Oh, there he is. All right, somebody shoot that. Shoot

600
02:02:34,569 --> 02:02:53,210
him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot. A saw. Yeah, a saw is better. I need to get

601
02:02:53,210 --> 02:03:11,210
up there. Come here. Get up there and shoot. Okay, so if I really had to do it, if I really had to

602
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:22,760
make the decision, I would probably say... Okay, I like the Lord of the Rings world more, but I like

603
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:38,579
the Star Wars objects more. That makes sense for some of you, right? I like the weapons in Star Wars

604
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:48,710
and the stuff and the ships and the lightsabers and the... I like that more than the swords and

605
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:54,069
the shields. Oh, wait. Wait. Okay, Game of Thrones... All right, hold on. Game of Thrones before

606
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:59,319
season seven versus Star Wars. I don't know. I like that the swords have names and stuff.

607
02:04:03,699 --> 02:04:17,289
Finish the level. All right, hold on. What is the Lord of the Rings? Yeah, they do. What? Yeah,

608
02:04:17,289 --> 02:04:26,090
that's true, but... A goblin cleaver? Yeah, I don't know. Shit, this is... I don't know. I might be

609
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:31,430
up in front of my own bullshit here because the lightsabers don't have names.

610
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:42,310
It's just green lightsaber. It's not like the sword of the morning. It's just yellow lightsaber.

611
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:54,220
Some do. Yeah, like two. Yeah, like the darksaber, right? Okay, there's one. What, there's two others?

612
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,760
Sorry. Out of like the 4,000 lightsabers that have been crafted from the fucking

613
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:16,899
Adamantite crystals, there's two that have names. Leia's Gonkdroid. I don't know how to do that.

614
02:05:16,899 --> 02:05:29,880
The crystals have names. Oh, they don't. Yeah, it's called like the... What are they called?

615
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:41,159
Cyber crystals? The hyper crystals? Kyber crystals? Yeah. I don't want to do that. All right,

616
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:47,319
here we go. Here comes the boss fight. The final boss of episode one. I had to do that. I'm sorry.

617
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:51,979
Fake fan. Chaos emeralds. Yeah, it doesn't matter. They're all the same thing.

618
02:05:52,779 --> 02:06:00,840
Don't be surprised, by the way, if in like three to five years, the chaos emeralds are turned into

619
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:15,460
beam swords. Why the fuck not? It is a Sonic game. That would be actually pretty cool. Why have they

620
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:23,850
not done that? Imagine a Sonic the Hedgehog game with lightsabers? It's Darth Vader. No,

621
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:57,720
oh, he has the mustache on. It's Darth Maul. Here it comes. Look at the skull. I want to be able to

622
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:16,229
see their faces. Obi-Wan, no. That wasn't supposed to happen to you. That's supposed to happen to me.

623
02:07:28,949 --> 02:07:41,899
Oh shit. Oh, no. No, Obi-Wan. Well, I want to do that. Can I catch them in the air?

624
02:07:45,739 --> 02:08:07,180
Aha. I can do that too. Traitor. Fuck. Darth Maul's a traitor, right? Traitor. I like this guy.

625
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:26,630
Spin, spin, he's spinning. He's doing this wrong. What do I do about this? He just blocks it. Oh,

626
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:38,739
he's three. He's no hearts left. That's Count Dooku. Count Dooku, join me. Join me, Link,

627
02:08:38,739 --> 02:08:48,840
and together we can destroy the Sith. I'll never join you. That's unfortunate. Now you will have

628
02:08:48,840 --> 02:09:09,930
to die. Fan fiction. I said Link. Yeah, I did say Link. And dude, in my fan fiction, Link talks?

629
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:25,859
Are you fucking kidding me? Do you guys think they'll ever give Link dialogue ever again?

630
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:43,739
I don't think so. Give me that canister. Maybe, why not? Maybe. It's probably gonna,

631
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:51,739
but it's gonna have to be a celebrity. Let's be real. It's gonna end up being Tom Holland,

632
02:09:51,739 --> 02:10:17,909
and you all know it. Right, get in the car. All right, other side. Elijah Wood. Yeah, I could see

633
02:10:17,909 --> 02:10:27,739
that. I would, you know what? I wouldn't even be bad. I wouldn't even, I would be okay with that.

634
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:39,779
That's doesn't even, that would be all right, I think. I think that'd be fine. He's 40.

635
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:48,649
But are we trying to say that, are we questioning the talent of Elijah Wood?

636
02:10:48,649 --> 02:10:54,810
You're actually doing that right now. Are you sure you're doing that? We are right now questioning

637
02:10:54,810 --> 02:11:01,380
the talent of any age Elijah Wood. I need a stormtrooper to get up here. All right, well,

638
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:06,680
let's just walk over here. Yes, that's unbelievable to me. All right, get him.

639
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:40,199
I was trying to like murder him. You're an Elijah Wood simp. Oh, please. He's like a wicked nice guy,

640
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:45,159
and he's really talented. Oh no, I can't believe you're sipping for that guy. He's like a good

641
02:11:45,159 --> 02:12:09,140
person. Oh shit, this is bad. Face us. Wait, no, no, no. I want to change character. I don't

642
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:20,579
want to be the one that gets, uh, the one that goes shopping later. Why does the double jump

643
02:12:20,579 --> 02:12:29,220
doesn't work? Okay, I, double jump doesn't work sometimes. Why would I work right there and not

644
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:37,350
work here? Click, click. All right, let's go everyone. I mean, Qui-Gon. No, stop running away.

645
02:12:41,939 --> 02:12:48,020
That was, wow. Does you guys like this game that much? That was very clearly a let's have a final

646
02:12:48,020 --> 02:13:01,050
boss fight here, and they took him away and ran him away. That one song I'm going to hear in my

647
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:26,359
sleep. That din-din-did-a-din. Fuck. Qui-Gon, help me. Qui-Gon. Holy shit, we just got like

648
02:13:26,359 --> 02:13:47,100
the AI director. It was like pissed we were taking too long. Hold them off. Spike. Wait, Qui-Gon fell

649
02:13:47,100 --> 02:14:09,899
off. Click the link. Just wait. Hold on. All right. Your toast, Darth Vader. Maul. Oh wait,

650
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:22,010
this is the part where it goes. What are they actually saying? I've heard that song a thousand

651
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:38,579
times. What are the lyrics to that song? It's gibberish. Wait, is it, it's actually just

652
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:51,130
gibberish? They just go, la la la. They're not saying anything? No, that's not real.

653
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:13,340
No, it's Latin. Wait, blue. What are they, what are they saying? Where's the other one?

654
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:30,659
That's it? Wait, is this thing where it's like Lord of the Rings where they made up a whole

655
02:15:30,659 --> 02:15:38,520
language? Wait, can we fight him? No, wait. Isn't, wait, doesn't, there's not how this

656
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:53,109
work happens in the movie. Yes, it is. Wait, no, how come we're both here? Let's change the,

657
02:15:53,109 --> 02:16:06,760
let's change history then. All right, but if you're playing with your little brother and he's playing

658
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:11,960
Qui-Gon because you don't want to play Qui-Gon for, you know, obvious reasons incoming, then what

659
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:27,689
happens when the little brother be really sad? By the way, I feel bad for people that have never

660
02:16:27,689 --> 02:16:31,449
seen Star Wars and they're like just waiting for some reason and you're going to see like the Lego

661
02:16:31,449 --> 02:16:37,639
version of like a major plot point of a movie. Okay, if you've held up with us long enough watching

662
02:16:37,639 --> 02:16:52,360
Star Wars, you never were going to watch it, so who cares? Here we go. This is it. This is it.

663
02:17:04,569 --> 02:17:26,760
Good block. How do you swing? How do you swing? Click, mouse, enter, space bar, A, Z, control,

664
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:42,819
shift. How do I swing with, how do I swing with Qui-Gon? H, J, K, L, semi, M, period, colon, slash,

665
02:17:43,989 --> 02:18:01,190
numpad, numpad. Okay, this is hard to do this. Fuck each other.

666
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:16,790
Just like in the movie. We're getting into an argument. Now Obi-Wan, you, leave me alone.

667
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:24,979
Oh shit. Spoilers. Yeah, you didn't remember this part.

668
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:44,819
Eventually we'll get it. Yeah, you guys don't remember the part where like Qui-Gon turns on

669
02:18:44,819 --> 02:19:00,069
Obi-Wan right here and he joins the Sith and then they have to battle it out and then dude Darth

670
02:19:00,069 --> 02:19:05,909
Maul breaks his double-sided lightsaber in half and hands the other side to Qui-Gon and they fucking

671
02:19:05,909 --> 02:19:23,530
both fight with a single saber at it. Ow. I don't know how to do um force pull with uh the other.

672
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:43,579
Oh there we go. Thanks for saving me. He's putting his lightsaber away. Hold on a minute. I just,

673
02:19:43,579 --> 02:20:18,520
I lost something over here. Get him in the back. Oh no. Nooooo. Am I right? Wait, that doesn't

674
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:50,709
happen. Ow. Ow. Ow. That fucking hurts. That's so, ah I didn't expect it to be like that.

675
02:20:51,829 --> 02:20:58,969
His eyes go X and he just smashes his head on the star. I'm not a monster. It was unexpected and

676
02:20:58,969 --> 02:21:08,469
quick. It's so abrupt. That doesn't even happen in the movie. Why are you laughing? I'm not

677
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:12,469
laughing at that. I'm laughing at, I'm laughing at the fact that it happened not the fact that it was,

678
02:21:12,469 --> 02:21:15,829
I look at laughing at that way that it happened not the fact that it was sad that it happened.

679
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:47,940
This is where we all get the medals right? Oh here it goes. Did that was, it was very enjoyable.

680
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:57,959
That was, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Um that was

681
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:16,440
like two hours long. Did this game come out on its own? No. One, two, three did. Okay. Because

682
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:20,920
I was gonna say if this like was a standalone just video game like the Phantom Menace that you bought

683
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:30,040
at Walmart. I'm not sure you got your $60 worth but it's three games. Okay. You guys know how

684
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:50,059
the credits look. Who cares? 6.3%. Okay so that was the Phantom Menace. Oh shit. How do I delete

685
02:22:50,059 --> 02:23:01,159
the second player? Drop out. There we go. It was like 30 bucks. Well that's good. We need a link.

686
02:23:01,159 --> 02:23:14,020
All right hold on. I'm gonna do a link and I'm gonna go take this. All right what is, what do you

687
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:25,000
got? That's, I'm not gonna click that. I will, I clicked it but I'm not gonna show that and that's

688
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,440
um something I am not, I will, there will be no comment. I'm gonna have an emotionless comment

689
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:38,329
on um on that image that I was just linked. Okay so anything else you'd like me to see before I

690
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:51,639
like get out of here? Go to the bathroom. Okay good. I'm the like the fat face penis shirt thing.

691
02:23:51,639 --> 02:24:05,340
I've already linked it last night. Uh this is a, this is a, I, I, why do you have this picture?

692
02:24:17,639 --> 02:24:23,829
That's the pants. That's the way the pants are. That's like the pants.

693
02:24:24,629 --> 02:24:37,420
Like okay do you think I have like a hamburger dick? Please. That's the pants the way the zipper

694
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:43,739
is pushed again. Larry David did an entire episode of his critically acclaimed hilarious

695
02:24:43,739 --> 02:24:51,799
television show Curb Your Enthusiasm about this exact thing. I don't even need to describe this.

696
02:24:51,799 --> 02:27:35,659
This is a Larry David routine so just go watch Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll be right back. Does

697
02:27:35,659 --> 02:27:40,940
Jerma hate Adam Sandler? No. I actually think Uncut Gems is a really really good movie and I

698
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:47,340
thought he was very good in it. I think uh Adam Sandler uh gets a lot of hate. Doesn't get a lot

699
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:53,190
of credit for some of the things that he's done. From the Saturday Night Live years through like

700
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:57,750
the mid to late 90s he made some really really actually really funny talented interesting things

701
02:27:57,750 --> 02:28:04,579
and he got a little complacent made three or four real stinkers in a row and then he uh got into

702
02:28:04,579 --> 02:28:10,229
some serious acting and I think he's I think he's pretty good. I think he gets too much hate for no

703
02:28:10,229 --> 02:28:21,479
reason. Well hold on a minute. Yeah he deserves quite a bit of criticism for like the five movies

704
02:28:21,479 --> 02:28:34,260
in a row that were like like 10 on Rotten Tomatoes right. It was a string of about six straight years

705
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:43,459
seven straight years where almost everything he did was awful just awful awful awful. We talk

706
02:28:43,459 --> 02:28:49,219
about like the before times and then the after times of like the mid-2000s Adam Sandler disaster

707
02:28:49,219 --> 02:29:07,299
career. Donkachino. Donka donka donka donka donkachino. Don't give me that. Don't give me

708
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:14,229
I saw it. People initially were very we were very mad that I just did that. Let's do this. Let's

709
02:29:14,229 --> 02:29:23,829
get back to this. We're gonna do episode two which is um back in the clones. Oh wait I have money to

710
02:29:23,829 --> 02:30:01,059
spend. Wait this bot right he's so slow I can't he is gonk an oven. What kind of droid is he?

711
02:30:01,059 --> 02:30:14,739
He's a trash can. Oh okay I knew he was something. When am I gonna get like some of the heavy hitters

712
02:30:14,739 --> 02:30:21,479
like Palpatine and oh wait this is the prequel saga right. Okay uh I mean I want to buy some stuff.

713
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:31,989
All right Phantom Menace. Wait I can do whatever one I want. I don't have to go in order. Oh I got

714
02:30:31,989 --> 02:30:34,629
to do I'm gonna do my favorite Star Wars movie then. I don't have to I didn't I thought I had

715
02:30:34,629 --> 02:30:38,469
to go in order like one two three four five. Did I watch the movies? All right fuck the whole prequel

716
02:30:38,469 --> 02:30:55,340
drill. This stuff sucks. I want to wait but I want to do which one episode. Okay Empire Strikes Back.

717
02:30:56,059 --> 02:31:05,989
Empire Strikes Back. By the way I'm also not going to be one of those like haters that says that.

718
02:31:05,989 --> 02:31:10,549
I actually enjoyed the prequel series for what it was. Sure there was a lot of problems with it

719
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:18,069
but I mean it was I thought it was okay. I thought it was look it they added some things.

720
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:28,329
Roy Decker. Why did I just buy that for? Extra toggle. What's that? Why am I buying these? What's

721
02:31:28,329 --> 02:31:54,489
an extra toggle? Where's where's Roy Decker? I just bought it. Not Roy Decker. Where's Roy Decker?

722
02:31:55,930 --> 02:31:58,969
Start a bar fight. I did that in the very beginning and I caused a lot of problems.

723
02:31:59,690 --> 02:32:03,290
All right let me do Empire Strikes Back. It's my favorite movie. This and Return of the Jedi are my

724
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:16,389
favorites. Empire Strikes Back. I don't want to be Qui-Gon anymore. Make a custom character. How? Use

725
02:32:16,389 --> 02:32:22,979
the character creator. Wait how? Where? How do I do that? Go back go back go back. Where? In here?

726
02:32:25,129 --> 02:32:46,059
Bonus. What's bonus? Is this like deleted scenes? Back to the main place. It's in the cantina.

727
02:32:47,750 --> 02:33:01,399
Boob guys please. Tube tube tube. Indiana Jones. What's going on? Trailers? Is this a trailer for

728
02:33:01,399 --> 02:33:21,719
Indiana Jones or Indiana Jones the game? Lego. I don't care about Indiana Jones at all. I really.

729
02:33:21,719 --> 02:33:27,159
Indiana Jones is now available to buy in the shop. You really gonna do that? I really I have to be

730
02:33:27,159 --> 02:33:31,000
honest. I really don't care. Indiana Jones is like at the bottom of my interesting

731
02:33:31,639 --> 02:33:37,620
American cinematic trilogies. It I just don't I don't hate it but I'm just not into it.

732
02:33:39,430 --> 02:33:53,159
Bathroom? All right give me out of here. Temple of Doom was awesome. Temple of Doom was crazy.

733
02:33:54,299 --> 02:34:05,350
But I'm not I'm not a big fan of the other ones really. It's the worst one.

734
02:34:06,309 --> 02:34:16,020
Is it? I think it's the only one I've watched. I just remember being like a little kid.

735
02:34:16,739 --> 02:34:23,479
How do I get out of here? All right I was like I was like 12 and I remember there was like a guy

736
02:34:23,479 --> 02:34:27,559
that like pulled people's hearts out and they like ate like animals brains and stuff and I

737
02:34:27,559 --> 02:34:45,180
remember being it was like I was scared. Over here two player arcade mode. Right right right right

738
02:34:45,180 --> 02:35:10,149
right right. Question mark. Oh look at this. I I need okay who do I want to be? Oh definitely

739
02:35:10,149 --> 02:35:27,379
a slug guy. C3PO. This now you talk about fan fiction. That's okay yeah yeah yeah definitely.

740
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:39,500
I definitely want an R2D2 Jedi. If I had my lightsaber by the way it would be um white.

741
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:53,350
It would be just white or um yeah be white. Just R2D2 with a gun. Silver yeah whatever it is.

742
02:35:53,989 --> 02:36:13,530
Well it has to match him. Blue. This is just like this sucks.

743
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:42,469
He's standing on two feet. Where's his droid body? Did I pass it? Okay as a stranger one. No hat.

744
02:36:42,469 --> 02:37:23,340
How do I take the hair off? What's going on? Gonk gonk gonk gonk gonk gonk. What what is it?

745
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:39,110
Okay so how do I use them? Ow. Auto D2. All right this is a good link. You're right.

746
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:55,850
You have to do it in free play. Oh auto D2. That's the that's who is inside of the case.

747
02:37:55,850 --> 02:38:03,930
That's very cute. All right so I can't use them in the story. Fine. All right let's I want to do

748
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:11,639
episode five. Let's go. Empire Strikes Back. I don't know if everyone's gonna call me like a

749
02:38:11,639 --> 02:38:16,520
Reddit normie for saying that this is like one of my favorite movies in the franchise. Sure go for

750
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:47,209
it. Turn of the Jedi is probably my actual favorite one. This is dark. You guys know the story. For a

751
02:38:47,209 --> 02:38:51,209
second I forgot what game I was playing. I just knew it was Star Wars and I saw how weird polygon

752
02:38:51,209 --> 02:39:03,510
looking that ship was and I thought something was wrong with the computer. Here's the force Luke.

753
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:09,819
I'm also one of those weirdos that didn't hate The Force Awakens. I wouldn't say it was my

754
02:39:09,819 --> 02:39:30,729
favorite but I didn't hate it. Why don't I get to do that part? I don't get to do that part.

755
02:39:30,729 --> 02:39:51,340
That part's awesome. They're all good. Uh these Darth Vader simlish. It's uh I love it.

756
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:03,530
Uh no I think I mean here's the thing about Star Wars. It's such a beloved franchise and

757
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:08,329
everybody loves it. Everybody is like oh it's the best thing ever but let's be really honest.

758
02:40:08,889 --> 02:40:19,020
Like probably half of these movies are not very good. The other half though

759
02:40:19,579 --> 02:40:28,329
they're fantastic. Like fan-fucking-tastic. Oh shit that's B to use your toe cable.

760
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:39,670
This one is this one's awesome so far. Okay well you can do it on the um the 8080s right?

761
02:40:45,719 --> 02:41:04,940
Ow out of bounds. Luke, Luke stop doing tricks and focus on the enemies. This is where Luke

762
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:08,219
gets way too overconfident and he just lets his force powers do he because he can just do

763
02:41:08,219 --> 02:41:31,190
anything he wants. He's like cheating in the lobby at this point. VAC. All right how do I get rid of

764
02:41:31,190 --> 02:41:43,750
this? I need I need a tie fighter to open this. Oh Luke why are you doing Peter Griffin? Peter

765
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:52,180
Griffin? What are you talking about? I did? When did I do my Peter Griffin? I have to do that to

766
02:41:52,180 --> 02:42:21,579
10 of these. Oh so long King Bowser. Wait we're fighting over the bomb. Who's gonna get it? What

767
02:42:21,579 --> 02:42:44,409
do I do with that? I gotta throw it in there. All right throw the bomb. What? Wrong way. Wrong place.

768
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:58,360
There it is. Throw it in. This is literally a kid's game. Yeah I know you I've never played it

769
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:01,799
though. You played this game like a thousand times when you were a little kid. I didn't play it.

770
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:26,729
Dropped him. I was 20 when this came out. When did this come out? This is pretty old doesn't it?

771
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:42,549
Are you how are you as old as me? How old are you? When did this come out? When did this actually come

772
02:43:42,549 --> 02:43:56,379
out? When did I do it? 2007. Now that's not that long ago. 2009. That's not that long ago at all.

773
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:14,920
Oh never mind. I don't know why I thought this game came out in like like 2000. Grab the bomb.

774
02:44:27,319 --> 02:44:55,989
Uh what? I don't understand. This is just like Tony Hawk. Ow. All right wrap him up. Let's go.

775
02:44:56,629 --> 02:45:13,850
Prove to everybody why you're my favorite movie. Boom. Bomb. It's lice. Blow it up. Blow him up.

776
02:45:14,569 --> 02:45:26,389
No get out of the fucking way. There it is. All right that's another one dead. How many more of

777
02:45:26,389 --> 02:45:45,639
these do I have to kill? Somebody said this sucks. It doesn't suck. All right roll it in.

778
02:45:55,340 --> 02:46:17,129
This is vomiting. Hold on. This whips. Don't make me laugh. Actually now that you said that why did

779
02:46:17,129 --> 02:46:22,100
you say that? Now am I gonna get sick? Don't say that out loud. I actually now I'm gonna puke

780
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:53,819
because you said that. I was fine until you said that. Okay yeah. Get up there. Shit why did you say

781
02:46:53,819 --> 02:47:31,639
that? I think we're good. What? Go up the ramp whopper cock. Okay destroy all the little droids.

782
02:47:39,719 --> 02:48:00,940
One more. Kill it. Kill it. All right now what? Now I gotta blow something up. Please stop moving

783
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:05,819
for a second. I'm gonna vomit. What should I have for food today? I know that's a weird transition

784
02:48:05,819 --> 02:48:29,559
but what should I eat today? A whopper? No Burger King sucks. Burger King just it's not it used to

785
02:48:29,559 --> 02:48:35,530
be good. It really did. You know maybe like 10 years ago I would have agreed with you and said

786
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:40,680
yeah I'm gonna go get a whopper. Or like a like a stacker. Like a BK stacker. That was my favorite.

787
02:48:41,659 --> 02:48:48,069
BK stacker with the stacker sauce. Then everything you ordered from Burger King as of five years ago

788
02:48:48,069 --> 02:48:52,469
was cold. What happened? Did they just like get rid of the microwaves? Did they get rid of their heaters?

789
02:48:53,430 --> 02:49:03,450
I have not had hot food from Burger King in five years. That's an accurate actual statement. I have

790
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:10,389
not. I haven't been there granted for very many times but the times that I have been there it has

791
02:49:10,389 --> 02:49:21,670
never been even warm. I don't know why that is. Now that happens at McDonald's not frequently but

792
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:33,780
it does but not to the extent that I've saw it at Burger King. Fine hot. Um well okay let me think

793
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:45,180
about this. Okay if you put your hand like on your ass right now. The heat like coming off your

794
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:51,510
ass right now. I would do I would consider that like like I would consider like McDonald's like

795
02:49:52,149 --> 02:49:57,379
warm. Like that's like fast food warm to me. Like like put your hand on like your belly like on

796
02:49:57,379 --> 02:50:00,979
your stomach. Just hold it there for a second. That's like okay like when you feel the burger

797
02:50:00,979 --> 02:50:27,420
in the wrapper that that's edible. That's edible. Like kind of hot. Do I kill these things? What the

798
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:39,459
fuck are you talking about? Like luke warm. Just like slightly warmer than room temperature is how

799
02:50:39,459 --> 02:50:51,639
a lot of fast food comes. You just made thousands of people you just made thousands of people touch

800
02:50:51,639 --> 02:51:01,579
their ass. Well no I just mean like your body heat. Body heat is like a respectable fast food

801
02:51:01,579 --> 02:51:20,120
heat. I'm okay with that. I'm not touching that. My ass is not wrapped up in a hamburger.

802
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:26,680
You supplast a fun thing. Like my ass is not your ass is no you're not gonna eat your ass in a wrapper.

803
02:51:50,709 --> 02:51:56,760
Before he gets up come on. This man can't beat a children's game. Do you see how much chaos

804
02:51:56,760 --> 02:52:15,690
is happening on the screen right now? Even more of these. All right let's get the big guy first.

805
02:52:16,409 --> 02:52:35,879
All right wait clear it out. Big guy first go. Fucking read the screen. I'm getting rid of the

806
02:52:35,879 --> 02:52:49,690
big guy first. I know I can see the icons. What are you talking about? Shit this this is no longer

807
02:52:49,690 --> 02:53:08,309
my favorite movie. This is not my favorite movie anymore. Oh give me a break come on. Okay I got it.

808
02:53:08,309 --> 02:53:30,489
You can't die in this game. Who cares? Star Wars diaper check? It's not full. But um what?

809
02:53:31,129 --> 02:53:58,600
What's wrong with me today? What am I doing? Why am I saying these things? No. You're a piss baby.

810
02:53:59,319 --> 02:54:07,860
Okay I thought that was a lightsaber and I was gonna say that's a very strange lightsaber.

811
02:54:08,979 --> 02:54:55,299
Hey you little piss baby. All right get it. Two percent. 10 out of 160. This is a cool game.

812
02:54:56,549 --> 02:55:03,510
Now I understand why this won the 2.5 billion dollar erasure screen. I get it now. This is why

813
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:20,540
you wanted me to play this so bad. Empire Strikes Back. Escape from Echo Base. Oh shit we're on the

814
02:55:20,540 --> 02:55:35,700
ground now. Links are now accepted. Well not yet. Let me get to uh an episode after this.

815
02:55:41,739 --> 02:55:46,620
By the way what's up? Like they're like brother and sister right? And like while we're like in love.

816
02:55:46,620 --> 02:56:03,799
It's fucking weird. Oh it's Han Solo. Oh this is not Luke. I thought it was Han Solo.

817
02:56:08,569 --> 02:56:16,020
Favorite movie. Yeah but I like I don't know whatever. It looks like Luke. It could look. It

818
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:21,219
could be. I was in the movie. I haven't seen it. I've not seen this movie in probably 10 to 15

819
02:56:21,219 --> 02:56:38,250
years at least. Who can open this? I don't know what to do. We played Battleship. I'm thinking of

820
02:56:38,250 --> 02:56:51,319
Battleship. What a fucking pog game that is. Nobody plays it anymore. Have you guys noticed that

821
02:56:51,319 --> 02:56:55,719
Battleship is not cool anymore? Nobody plays it when it's like one of the most interesting games.

822
02:56:55,719 --> 02:56:59,639
You know what I really really really hope to god happens and I'll be the one to start it if I have

823
02:56:59,639 --> 02:57:05,059
to. You know like chess took over Twitch. You're like Among Us took over Twitch. When is Battleship

824
02:57:05,059 --> 02:57:19,219
going to take over Twitch and be a huge thing? I'll do it and actually I'm very happy that chess

825
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:27,180
got very popular because that's a game. That's a game for brains and it's really interesting.

826
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:54,120
Where do I go? I can't pick up the I cannot pick up like the sesame street play telephone

827
02:57:54,760 --> 02:58:07,579
machine thing. How do what do I do? Build. Build Legos. What? Well I don't know I could take. What?

828
02:58:07,579 --> 02:58:35,270
I thought it was just whatever. So let's go. Build. Build. Build. What do we go from here?

829
02:58:35,270 --> 02:58:47,159
Oh one two three. It's a metal melter. How come there's been no Star Wars RTS game with like Jedi

830
02:58:47,159 --> 02:59:05,100
and stuff? Has there been? There was but what happened to it? It's been multiple. It exists.

831
02:59:07,180 --> 02:59:18,260
Yes. Did it age well? It's still good shit. Is it really? People still play it.

832
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:40,520
Yeah maybe I'll play it. Is it run on new hardware? It's on Steam. Is it really?

833
02:59:41,079 --> 03:00:15,940
I'm gonna have to check this out. Oh I missed a blue. Off screen. Can't even get me. Rebuild it.

834
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:21,700
Wait get the blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue.

835
03:00:21,700 --> 03:00:28,729
E-sports. Cheater. All right I'll get the right side you get the left side.

836
03:00:30,969 --> 03:00:47,260
Left side. I think we just move. Rebuild. Barrier. Barrier activated. Barrier online.

837
03:00:47,819 --> 03:01:09,209
Why did you say that? Barrier? That was an Overwatch joke? Well it wasn't an Overwatch

838
03:01:09,209 --> 03:01:15,290
joke. It was just I said a thing from Overwatch. If it was an Overwatch joke don't you think I

839
03:01:15,290 --> 03:01:18,250
would have been like hey remember what Overwatch would look like? McCree goes like a shadow.

840
03:01:18,969 --> 03:01:34,540
I just said they were lying. Didn't do anything. What does this do? Oh sick. I thought that was

841
03:01:34,540 --> 03:02:07,129
Worf from Star Trek. Oh C-3PO. Finally. We're dead. Skeletons in a kid's game?

842
03:02:09,340 --> 03:02:13,270
Heck. All right we need another person. Where's another person? Where's the next person?

843
03:02:13,989 --> 03:02:37,180
We're missing somebody. Wait can C-3PO open this? C-3PO come here. Okay that's the button. What

844
03:02:37,180 --> 03:03:08,870
happened to him? Oh shit. You can't control that? Move. All right get that door open. Wait okay I

845
03:03:08,870 --> 03:03:23,290
was gonna say he doesn't have any hands. Can he open it? This is kind of this is sad. Can we get

846
03:03:23,290 --> 03:03:57,299
him his his body parts back? Oh it's an ambush. You did this but I will deny that I did. All right

847
03:03:57,299 --> 03:04:23,270
rebuild. I'm gonna get on that gun. We do oh I need a Jedi for this in free play and his suffering.

848
03:04:23,270 --> 03:04:59,270
No. Oh wait coins. Move. Coins. They did a good job with this game. That's good. I like it. Yeah

849
03:04:59,270 --> 03:05:07,260
they are they're those little buttons. Doesn't this make you just want to buy a big Lego set?

850
03:05:07,819 --> 03:05:12,860
Dump it out on the counter. Look at it for a few minutes and look at the instructions

851
03:05:12,860 --> 03:05:16,059
and then put it all back in the container and put it in the closet and never open it again.

852
03:05:16,780 --> 03:05:37,850
What happened? Oh I gotta break that. Wait give me this. This makes me want to play Luigi's Mansion

853
03:05:37,850 --> 03:05:53,590
3. Did you guys watch that? All right one in the chat if you would actually watch me play

854
03:05:53,590 --> 03:06:09,940
Luigi's Mansion 3 and I think that would be like a POG champ stream. All right let's go play the

855
03:06:09,940 --> 03:06:32,709
first one instead. Yeah it's not very POG. Really? Damn adaptive difficulty. What's going on here?

856
03:06:33,350 --> 03:06:49,049
Let's get out of here. Get together. I love the first one so much. All right for Nintendo

857
03:06:49,049 --> 03:07:00,389
Switch week that's something that I should do. How do I get him up? Uh how do I get C-3PO out

858
03:07:00,389 --> 03:07:20,139
up there? Is he like his own little car? Wait he has his own little car. Wait C-3PO come here.

859
03:07:29,659 --> 03:08:06,579
No wait. Where'd he go? Is he gonna be up? Oh play Mario. Yeah this is gonna be a Mario week.

860
03:08:06,579 --> 03:08:13,219
I'm gonna play Mario Super Mario Super Mario. I'm gonna play Mario Galaxy 2. I've never played

861
03:08:13,219 --> 03:08:21,059
that before. I'm gonna Mario Odyssey. I gotta play Mario Odyssey as well. That's another one that

862
03:08:21,059 --> 03:08:26,819
you'll see probably pretty soon here. We'll go through all the good Switch catalog games that

863
03:08:26,819 --> 03:08:38,709
I never really got to. Hold on that's a lot of blues over there. I played Mario Maker. I played

864
03:08:38,709 --> 03:08:47,799
Mario Maker one and two. Oh what? I also want to do Mario 64 slide levels. Heard that exists as

865
03:08:47,799 --> 03:09:06,280
well. Do I have to jump on these? All right I got one. I have the same anger in Mario RPG when you

866
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:22,260
try to get the frog coins in the river. What about Zelda? I don't know about Zelda. I never was a

867
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:50,260
big fan of Zelda. I liked Ocarina of Time. That's kind of it. He's a dive? I'm just losing them as

868
03:09:50,260 --> 03:10:17,719
I get them. Yeah I'm trying to touch the buttons. It's a lot harder than it looks. It's not very

869
03:10:17,719 --> 03:10:33,370
much handling power here. It's children's game. It doesn't mean it's not designed to do more.

870
03:10:33,370 --> 03:11:26,920
Hey. Who said sit down? Shit. RTX on. This company. Yes. You got it. Step on it please.

871
03:11:27,559 --> 03:11:35,049
Developers developers developers developers developers developers developers developers

872
03:11:35,450 --> 03:12:05,479
developers. I miss like the meme ability of Steve Ballmer. Oh it's Chewbacca. Chewy. Chewy. Is it

873
03:12:05,479 --> 03:12:24,409
weird that the Han Solo's Chewy has the same energy as Walter White's Jessie? They both sidekicks.

874
03:12:24,409 --> 03:12:38,780
Yeah that's I guess that's true. I'm gonna step on the other one. Chewy we have to cook. Yeah over

875
03:12:38,780 --> 03:12:50,229
here. No no no don't block it off. Don't ruin it. Good. Now I see why uh co-op with this game makes

876
03:12:50,229 --> 03:12:54,790
a lot of sense considering that yeah there's a lot of things that would go faster with two people.

877
03:12:55,430 --> 03:13:22,010
Wait what? Points. Don't block it in the I did it. I ruined it. No I didn't. Do we get mounts?

878
03:13:22,649 --> 03:13:43,860
This is a switch? All characters except droids can ride creatures. This is awesome. Do they have an

879
03:13:43,860 --> 03:13:59,290
attack? Yeah but you can jump super high off of them. It's a one percent drop. Dude I got it. It

880
03:13:59,290 --> 03:14:14,250
only took me seven thousand attempts. Wait turn it off. How do we turn this shit off?

881
03:14:14,250 --> 03:14:27,690
I'm weird that I have to do here. Oh it's destroyed. He didn't move. You're on fault.

882
03:14:28,329 --> 03:14:41,180
All right get on the mount. Can't fight on the mount. Wait Chewbacca can rip their limbs off?

883
03:14:44,659 --> 03:15:04,260
A little morbid don't you think? Did he do that in the movie? All right somebody came down.

884
03:15:04,260 --> 03:15:36,809
It's referenced in episode four. Oh that's a neat little easter egg. Can we get in this?

885
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:54,389
This is the Millennium Falcon. How do I activate it? Stop protect me. Shit's ready to go.

886
03:16:02,309 --> 03:16:06,309
Oh there he is. This is where Obi-Wan and him no that's the other one.

887
03:16:14,620 --> 03:16:37,209
They're thinking that's Luke. They're just like why do they oh level complete. Yes you unlocked

888
03:16:37,290 --> 03:16:54,620
Han Solo. Princess Leia. C-3PO. Chewbacca. Are you a true Jedi? No. Is Kit Fisto in the game?

889
03:16:55,340 --> 03:17:11,620
Is he actually unlockable? I'm not that I care that much but I do. Play episode three.

890
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:17,379
Episode three. Episode three. Episode three. Go to episode two and three.

891
03:17:19,770 --> 03:17:36,299
Hold on I'm in I'm I'm like halfway through um Hoth. Stop being so Hothal.

892
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:54,389
Am I flying this? Where am I? All right gotta get 16 lasers. I just read that in the chat.

893
03:17:55,110 --> 03:18:07,299
Nobody said that. That's what really would happen. Doesn't matter how good of a pilot

894
03:18:07,299 --> 03:18:11,299
you are when there's like 6 000 ship shooting in random directions you're going to explode.

895
03:18:12,100 --> 03:18:39,690
Wait is that a true mega lull right there? The Darth Vader theme song. Only four more where are

896
03:18:39,690 --> 03:18:56,659
they? The last ones over here. That's the 34 by the way. I know how old I am. You don't have to

897
03:18:56,659 --> 03:19:12,180
remind me. Where are we up to? All right that doesn't even look like Chewbacca. That looks

898
03:19:12,180 --> 03:19:30,489
like cousin It from Adam's Family. All right just dodge the asteroid. Watch out for that asteroid.

899
03:19:31,370 --> 03:19:51,159
All right right now inside of this ship everybody is fucking throwing up.

900
03:19:51,879 --> 03:20:02,010
Because organs are out of their mouths. Even just doing that. Um how do I blow this up?

901
03:20:09,299 --> 03:20:53,750
Zero gravity. Doesn't matter. There are bombs to get apparently. How do I collect them?

902
03:21:01,049 --> 03:21:51,799
Any button? Oh give me it. Eat shit. What? Okay it worked. It's hard to control.

903
03:22:15,690 --> 03:22:19,299
This is too intense for a kids game. There's violence in this you're right.

904
03:22:20,180 --> 03:22:31,020
There's violence in this. No violence in my kids game. Only violence that I want. My kids programming.

905
03:22:32,280 --> 03:22:50,120
Dappy duck getting his face blown off by a shotgun. I have to do that again. All right I'm going to

906
03:22:50,120 --> 03:23:02,059
try to collect like a few of them. That's two right there. All right just go. Fuck. Can I get them back?

907
03:23:02,780 --> 03:23:11,379
I can't get them back. A lot of space missions in this one. Not enough lightsaber fighting.

908
03:23:12,020 --> 03:23:16,569
That's why I return to the jedis better because there's way more lightsaber fights.

909
03:23:17,290 --> 03:23:28,819
That's how I determine how good of a star wars movie it is. By how many actual lightsaber fights

910
03:23:28,819 --> 03:23:49,590
there are. And you love it for so free. Yep and again let's be honest with the franchise.

911
03:23:50,729 --> 03:23:57,290
The lightsabers are the only thing holding this thing together. Without the lightsaber sound effects

912
03:23:58,090 --> 03:24:21,540
no one cares. What about the Mandalorian? Yes I stopped caring about the Mandalorian

913
03:24:21,540 --> 03:24:36,969
after the fourth episode. Haste and point. And then I picked it back up again. Did I just die?

914
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:48,549
Episode one two three. It was like all right I'm into this. This is pretty cool.

915
03:24:50,069 --> 03:24:54,389
Soundtrack is incredible for the Mandalorians. I get one of the best theme songs of any new show

916
03:24:55,030 --> 03:25:03,579
in a very long time. But I don't I after like episode five they were just doing the same thing

917
03:25:03,579 --> 03:25:32,149
over and over again. There's no lightsaber fight. This is double score zone. I leave. Oh shit I got

918
03:25:32,149 --> 03:25:51,879
him. I liked the Mandalorian. I didn't love it. I really enjoyed the first half. If I can get more

919
03:25:51,879 --> 03:26:16,250
of those bombs. Episode seven and eight are the best. Season two episode two is the best. Season

920
03:26:16,250 --> 03:26:36,569
two is really good. Should I give him more of a chance? I'm seeing a lot of no's. I got shot at

921
03:26:36,569 --> 03:26:54,649
the midair. All right there's something to blow up right here. Secret. Check out what my dog does when

922
03:26:54,649 --> 03:27:14,180
I give him a bone. Hey remember when I said that I think that the Mandalorians like does the best

923
03:27:14,180 --> 03:27:23,030
new Star Wars content in a decade? Remember when I said that? I said that like after the first two

924
03:27:23,030 --> 03:27:31,860
three episodes. I just lost interest. I just did. I just lost interest. I was like I was like oh

925
03:27:31,860 --> 03:27:36,979
this sucks. I didn't know enough lightsabers. Not enough of this. Not enough. No I just like lost

926
03:27:36,979 --> 03:28:02,969
interest. The Millennium Falcon sure has a lot of lives. Lightsabers are dumb. They are not. You

927
03:28:02,969 --> 03:28:24,870
like them. You're up gaslighting yourself. I do. I do. I'm telling you I do love the

928
03:28:38,139 --> 03:28:41,260
you guys are telling me that I don't watch the Mandalorian and I just don't. I did the

929
03:28:41,579 --> 03:28:48,950
the you don't know what that is but I'm the one that lost interest. Unbelievable.

930
03:29:05,670 --> 03:29:10,309
That was sort of obvious. I apologize. That was kind of Peter Griffin.

931
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:45,750
Oh man. Stop talking over cutscenes. Oh whatever. We saw baby Yoda on your Reddit shelf.

932
03:29:46,469 --> 03:30:07,059
I like baby Yoda. Reddit shelf. Reddit shelf. Oh Normie. Now all of a sudden I'm Normie. Oh I like

933
03:30:07,059 --> 03:30:15,059
oh Mandalorian. I lost interest in the Mandalorian. What the fuck? Fuck you. What are you stupid?

934
03:30:15,940 --> 03:30:23,540
I think baby Yoda was like really cute and fun. Normie Reddit shelf user. We've got a Normie.

935
03:30:24,500 --> 03:30:43,719
Normie alert. So if I don't like the Mandalorian I'm an asshole but if I do if I love the Mandalorian

936
03:30:43,719 --> 03:30:58,459
I'm a Normie. Is there a middle ground? This guy likes Home Alone 2. I love Home Alone 2. I love

937
03:30:58,459 --> 03:31:02,620
both Home Alones. I think they're fantastic. I would love to watch them on stream if I was allowed

938
03:31:02,620 --> 03:31:09,100
to. I find them they're required reading for this stream. Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 are required

939
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:24,040
reading for this stream. If you haven't seen them you have to go watch them. Home Alone 2 is terrible.

940
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:34,069
Don't know. I mean it's not as good as Home Alone 1. Just like Gremlins and especially Gremlins 2

941
03:31:34,069 --> 03:31:40,409
is required reading on this stream. If you do not like Gremlins 2 and you are watching this stream

942
03:31:40,409 --> 03:31:46,899
right now and you you're like here I can't I can't believe that. I don't I cannot there's no way I

943
03:31:46,899 --> 03:31:57,530
could believe that. When like Hulk Hogan comes and like tells like the Gremlins when he's in the movie

944
03:31:57,530 --> 03:32:02,780
theater like cut the shit because they fucking with the projector. How could you not like that?

945
03:32:02,780 --> 03:32:19,930
It's like it's hysterical. You ruined it. That's like one of five thousand gags that are in that

946
03:32:19,930 --> 03:32:50,540
movie. I'm not a powerful force user yet. I can't lift this up. Was that a bat? I kind of like this

947
03:32:50,540 --> 03:33:03,209
level. I like the scenery. We're about to meet Yoda. That's not Yoda by the way if you're curious.

948
03:33:04,819 --> 03:33:28,520
That's Yoda's like goofy cousin who's like a tax accountant or something. Wait can I get that?

949
03:33:31,190 --> 03:33:46,469
Dove head first into the poison. Wait R2. R2 can you get that? You can't.

950
03:33:57,110 --> 03:34:14,120
That was the sounded like it was starting. Where do I go? Wait Yoda go get that. Yoda you have to

951
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:41,399
be able to do something. Not Yoda. Um R2-D2. What am I supposed to do? R2-D2 can hover?

952
03:34:43,239 --> 03:34:46,840
You know I don't know that because I didn't play for more than five seconds with R2-D2.

953
03:34:47,879 --> 03:34:56,420
Okay good. Good to know. His favorite franchise. No I didn't say that was my favorite franchise.

954
03:34:57,379 --> 03:35:42,260
Did I? What is my favorite franchise? Uh Niners Drive-Ins and Dives. Come here. Nice.

955
03:35:57,030 --> 03:36:09,670
Classic song. This is the Luke theme. You know I was in the theater and they played Luke's theme.

956
03:36:10,389 --> 03:36:13,190
Just started fucking screaming.

957
03:36:31,459 --> 03:37:11,030
He's just a little giggling. It's Mr. Bean. Mr. Bean. What the hell? Am I supposed to do that?

958
03:37:11,989 --> 03:37:26,600
Wait fix this. If you want to know my secrets, kill that droid that you're with. I can't. He's

959
03:37:26,600 --> 03:37:50,250
R2. He won't be learning anything then. I'm sorry dude. What was he teaching me? How to lift up

960
03:37:50,250 --> 03:38:10,889
things? I'm not strong enough. What was he doing? I don't know. I don't know how to do math anymore.

961
03:38:11,530 --> 03:38:39,690
I think I stole that from somewhere. Where did I steal it from? Me. This family guy when Chris

962
03:38:39,690 --> 03:38:58,729
sticks an army figurine up his nose. Okay so those of you guys that didn't see this, I'm just gonna

963
03:38:58,729 --> 03:39:03,739
say it because like I find it to be funny and I don't care if nobody else does.

964
03:39:06,969 --> 03:39:11,930
In pre-stream chat one time we talked about like doing family dinner too but the only difference

965
03:39:11,930 --> 03:39:17,690
was it was just me and a bunch of actors dressed up as family guy characters and I was Peter

966
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:23,909
and we just it wasn't even me it was just the family dinner but we were just doing family guy

967
03:39:24,469 --> 03:39:30,500
and there would be like pre-recorded videos of like cutbacks, reference callbacks to like cutaways

968
03:39:31,379 --> 03:39:34,569
so it would be it would just be it would be the same thing like family dinner too.

969
03:39:35,290 --> 03:39:42,090
It's still us but we're also kind of like the Griffin family and it would be unbearable for

970
03:39:42,090 --> 03:39:49,000
you for like fucking two or three hours and we'd just be like oh that reminds me of the time like

971
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:52,840
it would be me as Peter Griffin but it's me it's not I'm not I'm not actually being Peter

972
03:39:52,840 --> 03:40:09,879
Griffin I'm Jeremy Albertson. I got real close to pulling trigger on that one. All right Yoda come

973
03:40:09,879 --> 03:40:25,540
here. Did Yoda just kill me? Oh all right Yoda come here. Get on me. We fly? Wait I have Yoda's

974
03:40:25,540 --> 03:40:29,860
okay when I wear Yoda on my head I get extra power he's like a he's like wearing a piece

975
03:40:29,860 --> 03:40:52,579
of tin foil he's like an antenna. Yoda can you move like a little to the left? How do we how

976
03:40:52,579 --> 03:41:17,819
do I do anything? Not even my favorite movie anymore. Can we touch this? Why would they have

977
03:41:17,819 --> 03:41:33,579
bats in there? Why would you keep bats in here? R2 can fly. Yeah I know R2 can fly but I mean

978
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:39,420
how that seems like too far for him to go. Wait he can he's he doesn't die from the poison.

979
03:41:59,319 --> 03:42:10,120
I'm gonna get copy striked. I'm not whatever I'm not gonna get copy striked.

980
03:42:11,959 --> 03:42:37,270
Humming the Mandalorian theme song. Like he's humming a song. Don't ever listen to the radio

981
03:42:37,270 --> 03:43:04,340
ever again. Listening to the radio is illegal. All right I got it. Based and poopy pill.

982
03:43:06,739 --> 03:43:17,180
Thanks I guess. Well how do I get over there now? Wait what? R2 you didn't even do anything you

983
03:43:17,180 --> 03:43:37,799
just like gave us get off me. Oh shit just killed Yoda. Yoda I'm sorry. Yoda never ending like

984
03:43:38,600 --> 03:43:50,889
torture device for Yoda. I'll help you. I'll get you up just grab my hand. Um I don't think

985
03:43:51,530 --> 03:43:59,030
I don't think I can actually help him. Help him R2. Get in the way so he bounces off of you.

986
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:12,379
How did I get soft locked in this game? I don't understand. If I run too far away he won't

987
03:44:13,819 --> 03:44:21,690
he'll have to get spawned somewhere else right? I'm just trying to go far enough away where he

988
03:44:21,690 --> 03:44:49,319
gets pulled. Why can I not walk? All right he'll get pulled eventually. Pull him. Pull back. I

989
03:44:49,319 --> 03:45:05,100
think I actually have to restart this. And R2's just over there like oh what a bunch of

990
03:45:05,819 --> 03:45:30,420
fucking idiots. That's over I have to restart. Restart. I can't switch to Yoda. Episode four.

991
03:45:30,420 --> 03:45:53,510
Look we're only like a few episodes later. Come on. Hey Joe it's Star Wars. I can't skip the cut

992
03:45:53,510 --> 03:46:29,129
scene. Stop saying that. You literally did not need Yoda for that part. Didn't? Watch out. Can

993
03:46:29,129 --> 03:46:41,100
someone tell him? Tell him what? All right speed run. Just get to Yoda. Get the get the coins too.

994
03:46:41,100 --> 03:47:09,610
No just go. Yoda percent. No no don't have this happen to him now please.

995
03:47:10,809 --> 03:47:39,670
Jump out. Those are some pretty good fucking moves. Watch out episode four. I couldn't get

996
03:47:39,670 --> 03:47:46,299
past the Death Star level. Well you were eight. I'm 34. I don't think I'll have that much of a

997
03:47:46,299 --> 03:48:09,850
problem. Can we cut to me like raging and I can't do it. Oh you're not dead. I'm gonna let this play

998
03:48:09,850 --> 03:48:22,440
out for a second because uh this is just chasing around a fly in the house. Why is it still alive?

999
03:48:31,079 --> 03:48:56,489
God. A plant. Right I just. Latch on man. You're making me look really bad.

1000
03:48:59,139 --> 03:49:13,670
You look terrible. Stupid dog. You make me look bad.

1001
03:49:19,829 --> 03:49:52,420
Oh courage. You can do better than that. What is that accent? I'm getting showing up. All right

1002
03:49:52,420 --> 03:50:01,350
new year's resolution. No more screaming. You guys understand? No more of that. No more screaming.

1003
03:50:01,350 --> 03:50:07,079
I'm not gonna scream anymore. I'm just gonna chill. I'll be just hanging out playing a game.

1004
03:50:07,079 --> 03:50:13,559
Just chilling. No more yelling and like. Like no. I'm done with that. No more.

1005
03:50:15,850 --> 03:50:40,729
Kids eat this shit up don't they? No emotion. No. All right no talking. Do you think I can do it?

1006
03:50:40,729 --> 03:50:46,309
No talking for five minutes. I can't say anything. No speaking for five minutes. You don't think you

1007
03:50:46,309 --> 03:50:53,540
think it's possible? Okay at three at three hours and 52 minutes on the stream I'm gonna

1008
03:50:53,540 --> 03:53:41,129
not talk for five straight minutes. Okay here we go. I have to talk. You know when you watch like a

1009
03:53:41,129 --> 03:53:46,790
gameplay walkthrough of something that you're stuck on and you find a channel like this that

1010
03:53:46,790 --> 03:53:51,590
you're just like skipping through this person's like two hour long video which is like dude what

1011
03:53:51,590 --> 03:53:57,500
do you fucking how do you do this? You're doing terrible. I just want to see what what the next

1012
03:53:57,500 --> 03:58:01,319
puzzle part is and you can't you can't even do it. This is a walkthrough. All right this video has

1013
03:58:02,729 --> 03:58:10,780
four views. You if you were looking for that if you were a kid and you were looking at how to beat

1014
03:58:10,780 --> 03:58:16,379
this part after you just leave you'd be like all right well I guess I'm gonna figure it out on my

1015
03:58:16,379 --> 03:58:29,510
own. I need Yoda back. Somebody said gaining viewers. That you know what that was actually

1016
03:58:29,510 --> 03:58:42,139
kind of nice. That was like a talking break. How do I feel? That was pretty good. It's like

1017
03:58:42,139 --> 03:58:48,200
this is quiet for like 10 almost 10 minutes. That felt that was like a nice break. Do that more often.

1018
03:59:00,219 --> 03:59:10,360
Those two minutes? No it was not. I started doing that at 352 on stream. I gotta get him up here.

1019
03:59:10,920 --> 03:59:24,809
I have to put Yoda. All right hey get on this. Get on that. No what the fuck? That's not what I

1020
03:59:24,809 --> 03:59:47,340
wanted to do. Why did he just why did Yoda jump all the way back there? I can't lower this. I need

1021
03:59:47,340 --> 04:00:05,239
Yoda on my head to lower that but R2D2 didn't go on it. It's gonna be in the walkthrough? Yeah.

1022
04:00:09,659 --> 04:00:17,059
I'm not recording my mic. I'm capturing the game only. I have it split. I have uh the audio split

1023
04:00:17,059 --> 04:00:39,659
so it's not capturing my fucking voice. All right let's go. Editors do the right thing.

1024
04:00:41,049 --> 04:00:52,790
All right R2 get over here before I scrap you. Get on it. All right R2D2 go on that. All right

1025
04:00:52,790 --> 04:01:15,049
R2D2 go on that. How do I jump with R2D2? Let's jump. Start. Okay it's five on the d-pad.

1026
04:01:26,780 --> 04:01:49,129
What? What the fuck? You have to move with me. All right but how come he won't go on that with

1027
04:01:49,129 --> 04:02:05,180
the computer controller? I don't understand. This walkthrough sucks. All that matters is you just

1028
04:02:05,180 --> 04:02:55,110
skip to the part that you need to see. All right go on there R2D2. Who? R2D2? What? R2 what the fuck?

1029
04:02:55,670 --> 04:03:02,549
This sucks. This is so like this. They didn't do it good enough. What do you want me to say?

1030
04:03:02,549 --> 04:03:20,090
Okay what do you want me to say? Throw the controller into the ground. I have not any

1031
04:03:20,090 --> 04:03:25,530
trouble at all for four hours until the stupid swamp level. And of course, of course it's a

1032
04:03:25,530 --> 04:03:31,450
swamp level. All game developers. I don't care if it matches the fucking scene for scene of the movie.

1033
04:03:31,450 --> 04:03:40,440
Don't do swamp levels ever. They're all terrible. Make it concrete. I don't care if it matches the

1034
04:03:40,440 --> 04:04:02,760
movie scene for scene. Make it like grass. This is the walkthrough? Oh shit it is. That's right I

1035
04:04:02,760 --> 04:04:18,010
forgot. All right I'm supposed to not laugh this hard today. Watch a walkthrough to make

1036
04:04:18,889 --> 04:04:33,270
my walkthrough. No don't kill me. R2 get on that. I can't switch to R2 because I you don't

1037
04:04:33,270 --> 04:04:51,110
understand. I don't have two people here. Okay R2 get the fuck on that. R2 get on. Don't spawn

1038
04:04:51,110 --> 04:05:09,850
any fucking bats. Why won't he go on this one R2? Stand on that one. What the fuck is he doing?

1039
04:05:24,600 --> 04:05:29,399
What is he doing? Why won't he jump on this one first and then this one? That's what he's supposed

1040
04:05:29,399 --> 04:05:45,659
to do. Switch to R2. What if I switch back from R2? Okay I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I

1041
04:05:45,659 --> 04:05:50,059
get it. I get it. Fuck the goddamn swamp level. All swamp levels suck. If I ever make a video game

1042
04:05:50,059 --> 04:05:55,260
I'm gonna have the swamp level be first. The first level in the game and then what happens is

1043
04:05:55,260 --> 04:05:58,780
the swamp level before you even start it's like here we are. We're at the swamp.

1044
04:05:58,780 --> 04:06:03,739
Everyone loves these. Then you get to start and then a fucking nuclear bomb drops in front of you

1045
04:06:04,299 --> 04:06:15,899
and it's just and then you do skip that level and then like a portal opens on the left and it's

1046
04:06:15,899 --> 04:06:18,860
like oh it looks like we can't go this way through the swamp. Let's try this portal.

1047
04:06:19,899 --> 04:06:27,989
What the fuck? I get hit twice. Why? Seriously I get hit touched twice by bats and Yoda

1048
04:06:27,989 --> 04:06:42,659
fucking yeets off of me. I'm so bad right now because like this is I hate this thing.

1149
04:39:36,200 --> 04:39:58,340
that's it that's not it wait wait we're talking purely kids because that's different depending

1150
04:39:58,340 --> 04:40:15,979
on the age group r2 d2 carries the kid crowd and so does Chewbacca but I would probably say

1151
04:40:15,979 --> 04:40:21,979
the adult crowd like who carries the franchise for the adults probably Han Solo that's definitely

1152
04:40:21,979 --> 04:40:54,889
Han Solo I can't even see I get him oh shit get that in double jump I'm losing tons of money I

1153
04:40:54,889 --> 04:41:19,610
don't care do a ground pound feeding the enemy team uh an r2 dude what I don't get it what's

1154
04:41:19,610 --> 04:41:52,540
going on am I stupid okay let's go let's go the ultimate in fall jokes have been today

1155
04:41:54,069 --> 04:42:05,509
that's not even fair I'll be honest I kind of clocked out too like 20 minutes ago I kind of

1156
04:42:05,509 --> 04:42:25,779
clocked out in this game but I still enjoy what I'm doing give me that you get it no that's so

1157
04:42:25,779 --> 04:42:52,889
stupid I switched to him right when he fell down so I lost the money down zero stud Andy

1158
04:42:52,889 --> 04:43:16,439
whatever activate that while I go do work of course not oh that's a speed droid this is the

1159
04:43:16,439 --> 04:43:54,259
best strategy this is just this is doing the running boot in battle toads are you you know

1160
04:43:54,259 --> 04:44:01,799
it's really weird about this I forget what happens after that I can't wait did he just groin hit

1161
04:44:03,319 --> 04:44:10,860
okay um does that happen in the actual movie you like fucking pro skater groin smashed

1162
04:44:12,119 --> 04:44:28,779
like ball bust all right this is the final level of episode five this is it this is the big one

1163
04:44:28,779 --> 04:44:56,090
because when I blow up the Death Star or whatever happens at the end of episode five nothing

1164
04:44:56,090 --> 04:45:00,970
happens oh yeah the ending of episode five sucks right isn't it just like you'll never get out

1165
04:45:01,610 --> 04:45:22,840
you're here forever and then it's over right when does he get turned into a piece of wall art

1166
04:45:22,840 --> 04:45:47,479
oh it's right now it just looks like he full body scanned himself in the office printer scanner
