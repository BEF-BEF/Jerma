1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:16,649
Hi guys, how are you? Yes, we are very, very early. So early. 2 p.m. Eastern now. 11 a.m. Pacific.

2
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:29,690
It's very early. You know, I went to bed last night and I thought to myself,

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:40,179
you know, I neglect all the European crowd and I felt really bad about it. I was like, you know

4
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:48,490
what, I need to really start to do EU streams. That's why I did this today. It has nothing to

5
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:57,240
do with my dog having a vet appointment in like four and a half hours. Absolutely nothing to do

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:09,420
with that. But no, the truth is, yes, I have to go to the vet with Otto. He's fine, don't worry.

7
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,620
But because the appointment is weirdly in the afternoon, instead of just outright just not

8
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:27,819
streaming today, because it's three, four, five, I never get back in time to start a stream

9
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:37,819
because the vet that I go to usually has appointments scheduled out into the afternoon.

10
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,500
So instead of just not streaming today, I was like, you know what, let's just go,

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,379
let's just do it in the morning for like three or four hours. And because this stream

12
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:55,900
is only going to be like three hours, we're going to go on Saturday too. So we're going

13
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,439
to go bang, bang, bang, bang, four days in a row. Would you like to know what we're doing on

14
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,510
Saturday? Take a guess. How would you ever guess? There's like 500 million different things

15
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:18,819
to do. Hey, what are we doing on Saturday? Can you guess? No, you can't. It was recommended

16
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,340
to me a while ago, and I figured that's a good Saturday night kind of stream, is the

17
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:33,189
MS-DOS-Archive.org website. I'm going to turn on smart clicks, and we're going to play

18
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,520
a shitload of old MS-DOS games. That's what's going to happen on Saturday night.

19
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:56,919
I'm looking forward to it. There are, when I looked at it, I think there were 4,337

20
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,590
MS-DOS games. And it doesn't have to be a one time thing. I'm thinking if it's fun enough,

21
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:14,460
we could do that for like a Saturday night stream for the next couple weeks, you know, DOS night.

22
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:29,180
Well, I would call it something else. I would definitely call it something else. But today,

23
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,189
because I was fighting with the idea of what can I do in three hours today? I was like,

24
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,229
well, I was going to play Dreams today, but I don't have enough time. I want the move

25
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:47,129
controllers to really sculpt and shit because I want to really get into that. It's a lot of fun,

26
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,900
but I want to be comfortable doing it. So what I figured is instead of sculpting and making things,

27
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,460
maybe I'll make something small. But as you can see, when I turn this on,

28
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:12,729
we're just going to surf. I think I'm hovering over the perfect thing to start with.

29
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:24,860
This is, this stuff wasn't here before. So we'll do another little surf here. I believe it's 30

30
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:32,660
different dreams, right? Is what you get when you do a general surf. Or we can just pick them up.

31
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:43,689
I have cookie clicker open right now. This cookie clicker or the original cookie clicker.

32
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:57,509
So that's important. Maybe we can throw in the auto surf. But yeah, I'm not going to create

33
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,839
anything. I'm not going to spend like six, seven hours making anything today because I

34
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:10,089
really want to get those move controllers working and I don't have the camera. I was

35
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:16,730
going to go out late last night and find a Walmart or a Best Buy or a Target or something

36
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,899
that was open. And I did the thing where you can search to see what they have for inventory

37
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:32,889
and none of them open had the PS camera. So couldn't do that. I guess that would be

38
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,819
Dexter from Dexter's Lab somehow. I feel like we kind of have to open that one.

39
00:05:39,529 --> 00:06:05,750
Yeah, we do. Dexter's Lab. Hope it has theme song. Is there any sounds at all? Take book.

40
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:14,980
Right, I forgot. I thought that open. Let me tell you something. Never have your secret lab

41
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:32,089
right behind the book. How would you have it opposite side? Close lab. All right, let's go.

42
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:46,220
Can I jump? Oh, I can't wait to find. I can do it. Hold on. No, I can't. It's too early.

43
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:55,740
It's not close. It's okay. That's you know, when they do impression contests,

44
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,019
it's like 40 people come up on stage. Give us your best Dexter's Lab. Dexter. And you

45
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,730
get some really bad ones. I would be one of the guys there. I'd be in the top 20,

46
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,730
you know, you would hear it, you'd go, yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm not embarrassed for you.

47
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:23,800
I mean, I am. You're doing a Dexter's Lab impression contest. So right off the bat,

48
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:32,300
I am. But not after that. Not after that. At this time, you don't have any tasks,

49
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:47,079
but soon here will be a complete list of missions for you. Okay. Yeah, you stream

50
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,019
today. Here's the worst part about this. I feel so bad about this because

51
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,300
first EU stream in a long time. And it's three hours long. Hey, what was your last regular

52
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,180
stream? A seven and a half hours or something like that. What was your last EU stream? Yeah,

53
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:15,160
two, three, whatever. Do you really give a shit about your EU audience? Yeah, three hours.

54
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:25,529
See, six months from now when I do this again. Is this robot in Dexter's Lab?

55
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,350
I don't remember the orange Cheeto robot. I haven't seen this show in a long time.

56
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,759
This is really good though. Mark the calendar. November 9th EU stream.

57
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:55,509
I want to see that. Wait, wait, where's the, um, this makes his mountain creation look

58
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:09,500
slightly poor. Yeah, I know. But listen, listen to me. We all, we all have the things we're good at,

59
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:18,309
right? I'm, I'm not, what is that? I'm not good at making stuff like this

60
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,279
at all. And I appreciate that people are. I'm, I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth.

61
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:32,519
I do a full two minutes. Unlike a lot of you idiots. You don't brush your teeth for a full

62
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:44,389
two minutes. I do that. I do that very well. Two minutes. That's right. Every time I go to the

63
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:50,309
dentist. You have really, really nice teeth. I know. Yeah, I do it well. I do. I see you

64
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:57,830
got the thing that you do. You're, you're a dentist. Highly paid, highly skilled job. See,

65
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,179
I brush teeth good, don't I? We all do the things we do well. And the dentist is like,

66
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:08,220
please stop talking. I'm trying to, I'm trying to give you a crown. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, sorry,

67
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:23,370
sorry about that. This is really cool. Give that one a thumbs up. But yeah, look,

68
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,350
let's compare that with mine. Those of you that weren't here last night. Let me see, let's

69
00:10:27,350 --> 00:11:05,110
see mine. Uh, okay. My creations. All right. Look, I get where you're coming from here.

70
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,139
I get where you're coming from here, but also understand that

71
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:25,370
somebody has to make the art on the back of the cereal box. There's a place for all of us here.

72
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,409
I don't need my painting hung up in an art gallery, an expensive art gallery. Everyone

73
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:35,750
comes in and says, oh, this is made up. Unbelievable. Somebody has to draw a two can

74
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,490
sim and put them back there and make the fun puzzles. Doesn't have to be the best art

75
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:51,220
you've ever seen, but it exists. What's this back here? This is a guy's, well, I fucked

76
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,779
up his eyes. No, don't get me out of here. Don't make me want to fix this. I will want to fix

77
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:04,460
this. It's a guy with, that's his nose and his nose is sniffing over the mountain. That's his

78
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,649
hand. Oh, I didn't even play it. What am I stupid? I didn't even play it. Look,

79
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:18,980
it looks good from far away. Yeah, that's what it's supposed to be. It's like drawing

80
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:29,899
a name on a grain of rice. People have been wondering what's over here. This is the oil

81
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,100
coming out of his head because this is the robot fight over here that I was doing. He's

82
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:43,779
punching through this guy's head. That's oil. All right. Do you see that one?

83
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:55,720
Oh, no, no, don't save. Don't save. And then there's this. This is this thing.

84
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:20,889
This is supposed to be me. This is the way the camera is supposed to be right here.

85
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,289
Yes, it's supposed to be a jaw. I saw people talking about what the fuck is going on here.

86
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:32,409
It was supposed to be a jaw breaker. It was because it's supposed to be my mouth and

87
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:43,350
I don't know. My butt legit clenched. Yeah. Oh, don't people like it? Oh, yeah. Maybe I

88
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:53,240
shouldn't. I got 12 thumbs up on this thing. I didn't do that. And then here's this one.

89
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,279
If you didn't see it, just want to show you. If you didn't see it, this is called Scorpion

90
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:03,899
Boss. This is the ice cream one. And you'll understand that in a minute. That's the German

91
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,100
ice cream face, which is supposed to be an emo, but I didn't have time to do it.

92
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,330
I cannot get over that. You know, do you guys know that I was laughing in bed last night

93
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:29,509
at that picture of the person that made the popsicle one? It's too, I did not. That's not

94
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:43,990
what I was trying to make. It's just so, oh, I did not. That's not what I was doing.

95
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,210
Anyways, there are my three creations. What does this one have? Oh, I didn't make this one

96
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,539
publicly because it's not done. You couldn't make this one more done. So I'll just stay like that.

97
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,899
So compare that with somebody has to make two can't see them, right? Somebody has to art.

98
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,460
It's the best thing about art. I can make anything I want. I think it'd be a piece of

99
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:20,059
crap if I wanted it to. And I could somehow stand up here and be like, well, um, are you

100
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:25,899
sure? And I would, you know, put on my big glasses and stare at it and go, well, because

101
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:33,500
I have some news for you. It doesn't matter because art is completely subjective.

102
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,059
And I start talking like a serial mascot, you know, to, for my inevitable fate.

103
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:50,179
All right, let's, let's just, um, let's just breeze through some, it's called ball world.

104
00:15:51,299 --> 00:16:03,740
You sound like Krillin from Dragon Ball. World select. Oh, this is the, uh, this is the

105
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:16,009
menu. World select. Update. Support me. World select. We'll see it soon. Sonic menu.

106
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:38,299
Are you kidding me? This doesn't surprise me at all. I'm going to turn it down. Um,

107
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:43,259
this doesn't surprise me at all considering what people were showing me in VR chat.

108
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:53,220
It's not surprising. People are just so good at doing these things. All right. Well, I

109
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:03,159
guess, oh, I can, you just go down into the city. All right. That's cool. All right. We're going

110
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:25,700
to go, of course we're going to go to a green hill zone. LBP pod. LBP. Oh, it's a little big

111
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:40,220
planet. Okay. There's triangle change in music. Touch pad to hide. Okay. This is really great

112
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:55,049
too. Somebody just goes, yo, ball world adventure map. Let's go. You have to stay on

113
00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:02,839
this. Is this like that toy at the doctor's office? Oh, no, no, no. This is the actual

114
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:17,130
overworld. Okay. Let's go. Sky Hills 1-3. This is Sonic level. Sonic, what's this thing?

115
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:25,750
Sonic, I'm having, Sonic, I'm having a feeling about this place. Um, looks like we've been

116
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,630
here long ago. Anyway, the good new is there are only 40 lost emeralds. But wait, I see

117
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,789
something on my smart teleport radar device. Maybe only the storm. Nevermind. Be careful

118
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:43,750
out there. Come back to the future platform. I thought that meant like come back to the

119
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,269
future. Come back to the future platform based safe and sound. Got it. Good luck. Time traveler.

120
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:43,130
What do you think of Sonic the Hedgehog? What's the first thing you think of besides

121
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:52,839
like speed? How loud the game is. All right. How about now? What do you think of now?

122
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:08,220
Oh, okay. This is a bad experiment because that's not what I'm okay. Not like, no, no,

123
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,859
no, no, no. All right. Well, what I was gonna say was music. I was gonna say music.

124
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,089
That's the first thing you think of. Then boy, they got a long way to go to fucking

125
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:36,579
salvage this guy. Imagine that. Oh, hey, what did the Super Mario? What's the first thing

126
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:44,259
you think of when you think of the word Super Mario Brothers? Porn. Poor feet. Porn. Um,

127
00:20:44,980 --> 00:21:01,299
okay. We're gonna, uh, I don't, I was, I'm surprised. All right. Well, I was gonna say music.

128
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:06,309
So why wouldn't they just make more? Never mind. I'm gonna move on because that's,

129
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,829
this is not gonna work. Sonic, be careful from here on. There is no way back. You

130
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:17,099
should have found it at least 35 emeralds. Check them out and go ahead if you're ready.

131
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:26,259
I only have 26. It's like an E3 conference. You know the guy asked the crowd something.

132
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:39,190
Imagine like Sonic has an E3 conference and fucking, I don't know, George, whatever his name is,

133
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:49,670
comes out. Whoever the CEO of Sonic the Hedgehog is or Sega. Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

134
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,990
it's, and joining us now is the head of Sonic Team, George. He comes out,

135
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:04,089
fucking suit on. All right. Hey, everybody. How are you? Hey, how are you? Yeah, yeah,

136
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:15,480
thank you. Thank you. So today, but, but, whoa, wait, there was a shark here. Whoa.

137
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:22,710
That's pretty cool. Anyway, so, uh, ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you something.

138
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,990
Before I get started with my next major announcement. By show of hands, how many of

139
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,829
you got, how many of you guys associate Sonic the Hedgehog with porn or feet?

140
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,819
And like, they, they, they scroll over all the journalists and they're all fucking

141
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:45,660
putting their hands up? No, that's right. That's right. So what we're announcing here

142
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:56,140
today. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I don't, I don't have enough emeralds.

143
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:15,269
Uh, run towards the screen like in Sonic Adventure. I didn't, I didn't play this one.

144
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:32,519
Oh, I have 31. He's stuck. I, I did, I did. I don't think I ever played that one.

145
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:40,619
I played it on stream. I don't remember that. Hope I'll make more levels in the future.

146
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:47,210
Press triangle to change music. Oh, this is the menu for that. Okay.

147
00:23:50,009 --> 00:24:05,660
Okay. This is Ball World. Get a tie. This is cool. Oh, I'm going to fall. This is a little slippery.

148
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:21,819
It's very slippery. He put extra grease on here. That's fast. By show of hands,

149
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:27,910
how many of you people associate Ball World with porn and feet? Oh, that's too many. Too

150
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:49,220
many. Too many. Well, not today. This is actually kind of good. Now this is just,

151
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:56,740
it really is like a close-up doctor's office toy. Do I have to go around it or just jump?

152
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,089
I think I have to go. I don't think I have enough speed. Now I gotta just.

153
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:31,509
Oh God. Do I have to go up? In the Sonic menu. Wait, I already did this one. This is the God.

154
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:46,299
There we go. This is what I wanted. Little big planet, the garden. This reminds me of your iPad

155
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:51,900
game streams. Well, it's a pretty similar format. You play something for 10. Well,

156
00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:01,460
that's like the appeal, right? The appeal of this game is to just surf around and see what

157
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,940
people have made. It could be anything. It doesn't have to be a game. It could just be artwork.

158
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:14,259
I just hope that they keep updating those tools and keep making it, you know, intuitive and

159
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:20,250
creative because we've seen some awesome paintings in this game. The last time we did a

160
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:27,099
little bit of dream surfing. I know everybody wants to make a game or see a game, but holy

161
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:38,390
shit, some of those are good. I missed a ball. Now, how many are you? Why is it Dr. Phil? Dr.

162
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,630
Phil comes, all right, Dr. Phil comes out to announce the new Sonic game and he asks that

163
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:50,069
question and then he psychoanalyzes everybody in the audience. Now, why do you think that?

164
00:26:50,069 --> 00:27:06,380
Why do you, why are you searching for porn in Sonic the Hedgehog? What happened? Oh,

165
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:21,480
I like this button. You know what I want to make? You know, if I'm going to make a level

166
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:33,299
ever, I want it to be a bunch of wall jumps. Sonic has a uni eyeball. It's a mega turn off.

167
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:48,279
All right. Oh, cookie clicker. This is what I came here for. Earn cookies by clicking a

168
00:27:48,279 --> 00:28:09,430
huge cookie. Wait, okay. Upgrade achievements. Cookie clicker. No, you can't use that here.

169
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:20,630
You cannot use like the porn reference here. Only one cookie per, hold on. I'm limited to

170
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:26,119
the amount of times I can press X and it's not even registering them all. All right. What about

171
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:37,339
upgrades? This is actually, somebody made this. How many grandmas? No, I need a better cursor.

172
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:57,019
Let's go back to it. Get grandmas, get grandmas. I'm getting them. How do I get more

173
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:11,289
click? Cursor. There we go. 97 cookies. Profound statement. Is this going to be the next three

174
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:18,299
hours? Look, I don't schedule anything. You know, I don't plan anything. I don't really schedule

175
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,460
anything. So I mean, it's like very possible that this could be, you know, if I'm having

176
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:46,140
fun. Bold content to stream. I need gold cookie. Can't you click on cookies? Don't

177
00:29:46,140 --> 00:30:01,980
they pop up randomly? What are you doing? What? I don't, this is a recreation of cookie

178
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:12,009
clicker in dream. This is really well made in the first, and everyone's just mad that

179
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:25,130
I'm going to be playing it for, all right, fine. This is what you get for the EU stream.

180
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:31,779
Yeah. The EU friendly stream is me playing a remake of cookie clicker. All right,

181
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,819
I got to get out of here before I stay here all day. I'm going to like

182
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:44,009
miss my dog's appointment. No, but you don't understand. I have to go. I got 700. Let

183
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:48,170
me just get one factory. No, let me just, let me get one portal and then I'm out of here.

184
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:59,190
I'm done. I just want at least one of each. I just want one of each. That's it. Okay. Here

185
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:14,390
we go. I want five of each. I almost have 2000. Don't worry. Okay. Come on. Almost there.

186
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:29,180
Make an idle game with like the planets. You know, I've actually thought about something

187
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:52,420
like that before. I thought about making an idle game and make a bunch of elaborate,

188
00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:00,490
stupid things you can do in it. It's funny you mentioned that because I've been talking

189
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:12,809
to somebody in particular about making a full-fledged game. One that is, you know,

190
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:24,410
comes out releases and you can play. And I got a little bit of a hint for you. They're,

191
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,819
they're currently VIP right now. All right. All I wanted was 15 of each and I got what I

192
00:32:30,819 --> 00:33:03,000
wanted 20 of each and I got exactly what I wanted. Make a dating sim. Somebody recommended

193
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:26,440
that to have, hold on a minute. I was going to say it kind of looks like my face from

194
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:41,369
back here. That could be me. That looks just like me. It does. Wait, what was this?

195
00:33:44,970 --> 00:34:01,940
I just drowned. Is there a punch? I think I just get chased. I need 30 coins. The

196
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,980
braid is perfect. All pirates must use secret tunnel. Beware of ye beasties. No treasure

197
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:19,769
hunting allowed. Who is this person behind me? Why are they the, it's a person inside of

198
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:37,699
a person. That's a person inside of another person. That's not supposed to be one that

199
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:46,460
looks like a baby holding onto its mother. No guys, that's two people. There's two hats.

200
00:34:46,460 --> 00:35:00,840
Don't tell me this is not the same person. There's two hats. What do you mean we know?

201
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:14,219
Oh, was I just arguing with myself? Why did I make up this character in my head that told

202
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:30,179
me this was one person? I don't know. 22. Oh, not yet. Oh boy. I don't know. What's

203
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:43,420
the mechanic based on? Why is that here? I'm talking to one guy. Say I knew what I was doing.

204
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:58,889
All right. Is this person still following me? No, they can't get up here. So I need 22. That

205
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,940
ghost is not getting up here, are they? I don't think it's supposed to be up here.

206
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,820
All right. This is the unfinished zone. Guarantee it because that's a non-painted

207
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:23,510
T-Rex over here. Damn it. Oh, I knew it. I need to go see what that says. That's

208
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:32,730
developer island. They want to keep me out of there? Don't you know? Do you know what I

209
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,579
used to do in World of Warcraft when I was bored? I would find a corner and I would jump

210
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:46,739
up to it for hours until I got up the ledge on top of the mountain and ran into the no

211
00:36:46,739 --> 00:37:00,809
player zone. You're gonna keep me out? Doubt it. I would do it for hours. Hours. There

212
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:07,610
was this one spot in Ironforge in the corner next to, I believe, the mailbox where if you

213
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:13,079
jumped at the right moment and pixel perfect jumped over and over again, you could get to

214
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,980
the top onto the ceiling and people would be sitting there doing it and they wouldn't be able

215
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,820
to do it. They would be just, you know, five or six people. This is back when they were

216
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,699
like fucking five trillion people that played the damn game and I would just crack my knuckles.

217
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:33,019
I would log in. I'd be like, all right, let's check the mail out. I got, we got like three or

218
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:40,099
four people trying to do the jump, huh? Crack my fucking knuckles and I would go do it first try

219
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:44,179
and everyone would stand there and stop, look up at me while I like did like the wave from

220
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:50,869
all the way at the top and I would go, I'd get on my huge awesome fucking dragon up there.

221
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,670
Like I get on my awesome mount up there. So people like, oh, amazing the mount too.

222
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,820
And then they would try again and I would try, I wouldn't tell them the secret.

223
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:13,699
Why would a magician ever reveal their secret? Hey, what does that sign say? I want to go see

224
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:19,239
the T-Rex, but I can't go stand over there. Can I stand here? No, definitely not, right?

225
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:31,900
No. All right. Developer Island is, oh, well that's the, is that the, I think that's just

226
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:51,960
the door. Do not feed anyone to the animals. I don't think he has collision on his head.

227
00:38:54,059 --> 00:39:00,090
Why am I lying? Why would I lie about something so stupid?

228
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:17,289
It's like that, that's the dumbest thing to lie about. Because you have, what? I'm not a liar.

229
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:36,500
Stop it T-Rex. Oh, well I just had to walk in. I just skipped that. I like this one. I'm gonna,

230
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:46,920
I like that one. Yeah, why are you like lying about, I already did this one. Hey dude,

231
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,630
why are you lying about jumping in this specific corner in World of Warcraft? Oh no.

232
00:39:55,269 --> 00:40:11,369
Oh no. Silent Hill.

233
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:54,409
Damn. All right, so this is, this is not a game this time. We're just watching. Nice. Oh, I love

234
00:40:54,409 --> 00:41:12,789
it. So this is the kind of shit that I would want to do. And I'm, I want to move the, I'm

235
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:27,590
gonna get like record and camera and shit. Can I just be like the camera guy? Can somebody make

236
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,550
me something cool and give me the assets and I'll just make a video? Can I just like edit the video?

237
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:49,590
Instead we got the scorpion boss fight. I'm gonna ruin this song for everybody here.

238
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:56,949
But the Silent Hill theme song is just a slowed down nice Italian restaurant.

239
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:37,269
This is still going, huh? It reminds me of the Godfather. Yeah, yeah. Cloud Factory.

240
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:44,360
Another video. Good. This is what I'm talking about. Another thing we can just watch.

241
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:49,929
Streamer doesn't produce any content. He just consumes it on camera with you.

242
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:56,280
Look at that. Look at this camera work. I don't have to do anything.

243
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:21,750
We can just sit here. Look at that log. Nice placement of the log. You ever just have a

244
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,940
weird freak out moment for five seconds? I'm going to give you the weird insane freak out

245
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:34,170
moment that I just had right now. It was and these feelings are only a tenth of a second

246
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,489
and then they're gone because of my brain goes you're an idiot. What are you talking about?

247
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:41,960
Stop being a weirdo. When he put his hand out like that and was looking, I just for a tenth

248
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,920
of my brain was just in a splash. It was like you have a VR headset on. Take it off.

249
00:43:46,920 --> 00:44:02,380
Oh no, no. I'm not in VR. It was not even a tenth. This is lies.

250
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:15,829
This is really good. You're ruining this. Stop it. Everything is a lie.

251
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:37,429
Dream cheese. That's well beautiful fucking landscape. I'll tell you by dream cheese.

252
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,219
The smokestack. Look at that. I want to go. Can we rewind? I can't even.

253
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:51,289
Those smokestacks back there. Green Hill test zone. This is another Sonic the Hedgehog.

254
00:44:51,849 --> 00:45:06,099
I can't get the rings. I don't know how to do sonic slope logic so just run into it.

255
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:25,030
Ha ha ha. Nice. Silent Hill's police station. Oh fuck.

256
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,130
That's very, that's really high quality sculpture.

257
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,250
That's high fidelity sculpturing.

258
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,610
Is there rain out the window?

259
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:50,170
Compared to where my anything is. Look at that.

260
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,639
All I can make of monsters and fucking like love crafting horrors. I can't do anything else.

261
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,710
Hey you guys laugh and I can't do this but hey don't you think I could do a pretty damn good

262
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:18,230
job making like the next Dead Space 4 fucking enemies? I think I could. I could pull all kinds

263
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:30,699
of fucking crazy shit out of my head. You know I am available for consulting work if you want

264
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:46,440
to be scared. This is really really good. Jerma, Jerma you're unemployable. Oh you know

265
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:56,280
me so well. Yeah. Yeah you're unemployable. Yeah I know you. What do you know? What do

266
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:03,929
you know? He struck a chord there. How would you know that? You don't know?

267
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:23,159
Ethan's house upstairs. Press X to go downstairs. Who's Ethan? He's actually mad. No but you can't

268
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:28,360
make an assessment on something. Okay let me tell you something. You cannot make an assessment

269
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:35,239
on somebody's career aspirations or abilities based on them playing Dreams for fucking three

270
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:44,820
hours. Okay if I handed you a controller and you were Bill Gates, like 25 years ago Bill Gates

271
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:51,860
and you're like Bill Gates can you like make a sculpture in Dreams? He'd be like I don't

272
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,579
understand what you want me to do here. He'd make a fucking worm. I made a worm there now didn't I?

273
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:03,619
Yeah you did. You did. You did Bill. Interesting. No no Bill you can't you zoom in you zoom out

274
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:07,460
you zoomed in. Oh well sorry about that. I thought I the controls are kind of hard.

275
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,059
I put a face on that worm didn't I and it looks bad but you're like oh nice job Bill.

276
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:22,489
Is Bill Gates unemployable because he can't what Bill Gates is unemployable.

277
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:42,150
You're right you're just like Bill Gates. Thank you. I love the badge.

278
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,579
That was the voice I was just doing for Bill Gates. This is Bill Gates talking to us.

279
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:28,780
I need to make all of this shit. They had to do all day to put it in the right place. They put desks there.

280
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,699
Now they didn't have to make every single thing because obviously the game has a clothing

281
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,579
feature. You have to make it once and then you can use it over and over again

282
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,659
and change the color on it too.

283
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:55,639
Ethan's house downstairs. Is this supposed to be this person's house?

284
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:11,539
Pokemon? Professor Elm has been waiting for you dear. The only reason why I do that is

285
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:15,460
because of the backwards hat. I didn't I could not tell if he didn't have the hat on I

286
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:29,050
wouldn't know this is a Pokemon game. The music I've never played Pokemon is another Sonic.

287
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:44,420
This is pretty good Sonic. I dare say that this may be the best Sonic we've seen so far.

288
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:55,130
It might even be the same one. Here's the interrogation. We're going to get a lot of

289
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:17,460
signs on the hill. What's your name sir? Tom Sanders. How well did you know him? Did he

290
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:26,900
seem different? Any possible motives? Any possible motives? I can't think of any. Did he seem

291
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,920
different lately? He had been down for a while after losing his job but that was nothing

292
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:42,980
new. This just came so suddenly. How well did you know him? We go back a long time. And then

293
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,940
he fucking tosses the table over like a Lovecraftian German created horror comes out of his mouth.

294
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,429
I know talent when I see it. Could you tell us about... It's strange though.

295
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:02,019
It's happening everywhere now doesn't it? All over town? Yeah it's a real head buster I'll

296
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:10,840
give you that but uh maybe it shouldn't surprise us. Oh yeah? Why's that? It's freaky.

297
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:17,079
This guy's scary. I have been looking around me lately. The mood is different. People seem

298
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:22,539
so on edge. So many have ended up on the streets recently. Does this happen in Silent Hill?

299
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,900
Economies going through tough times. Takes more than that to start a riot like this.

300
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:35,340
There could be more to it than just that. I'm sorry exactly how did you know Henry Sullivan

301
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:47,000
again? Yeah? Those photos you requested sir. Ah yeah the photos of the crime scene I asked

302
00:52:47,000 --> 00:53:00,980
for. They're in the photo lab. Realistic knocking. We'll talk later Tom. That was not me.

303
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:14,360
New Bark Town. Another dog game. I can't wait. I love the dog ones. They're the best. Oh no shit.

304
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,599
I made that sound like I didn't think this one was good. I meant like I thought it

305
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:40,260
was gonna be a dog one. Oh that's pretty nice. This is pretty cool town. So you know

306
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:46,179
when you play and you just realize you have this moment in your brain where you understand

307
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:54,139
how everything works now? I do. Remember I was asking about lighting and how do I turn on the

308
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:58,679
lights? What do I do about the lights and lighting? It's the glow tool. That's it.

309
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:06,360
You can make anything a light. I thought that you had to stage it. No it's just the

310
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,920
glow tool. That's it. Anything can be a light. Anything can emit light.

311
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:29,460
You can make light any color and you can aim it. Well what is this? Is this a oh that's a

312
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:36,980
ra what's it rat? Ratasco? Ratatouille? Ratatouille? Ratatouine? What is it what is

313
00:54:36,980 --> 00:55:00,710
called? Tabasco? That's sauce I've ever made. This is uh I can't even go in here. Look at

314
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:25,500
how huge I am. Ratabasco? Ratatouille? Ratabasco? Ratasca? Ratacastrobrown? Um what are the rats?

315
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:35,019
This is really cool. I'm gonna get a thumbs up from me. Tabasco is fucking disgusting. It is

316
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:44,860
not. Um if you really think Tabasco is disgusting then you and I are no longer good friends.

317
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:53,289
We're now kind of fun friends not good ones. Wait no remix of silent wait what do you mean

318
00:55:53,289 --> 00:56:01,099
remix? I can hear them calling to me from hell. I used to do that when I was younger. I forget

319
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:13,099
a word in the sentence and I would put it above and then point an arrow down. I can hear them

320
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:24,380
calling to me from hell. Forgive me Lisa. There's some monster inside of me. Oh boy

321
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:30,940
they always write those things. I sent more info on this guy now. You're living in that hotel.

322
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:37,260
You know the worst thing in the world is what we're describing here. All right what we're

323
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:45,190
talking about now. I I do this shit on checks and it makes me so self-conscious and I feel

324
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:53,130
like I hate it. I will write a check to somebody and it'll be like oh who am I writing that to?

325
00:56:53,210 --> 00:57:00,329
Oh you're writing it to B&B Associates LLC or something and it's like oh fuck why do you

326
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:04,489
have to have such a goddamn long name and I'll write the checkout and I'll get to the end of

327
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:14,059
the line. I'll have like the S in associates written up and I'll have to do make tiny tiny

328
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:21,860
little letters and trail it off like it falls off the cliff and don't even get me started if

329
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:30,340
it's a weird uneven number like four hundred and twenty two dollars and sixty eight cents. It's

330
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,380
just like fuck do I have to write this whole thing out? Can I just just give it to you?

331
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:41,639
Can't you just make it like four hundred dollars or like two hundred dollars or like

332
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:45,639
one thousand dollars? Why is it always like ah that's right there. Thirteen hundred forty

333
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:49,079
four and fifty two cents. I don't want to write that whole thing out. You have to write

334
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:56,409
the whole thing. No but not even numbers as in like I'm talking about like a like an

335
00:57:56,409 --> 00:58:01,239
easy flat number to write out because you guys have ever written a check before?

336
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:21,960
No. How many of you guys have ever written a fucking check? This is this is wonderful.

337
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:29,929
This is really good. I love the coral reef and the little astronaut guy. The little underwater

338
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:39,989
scuba guy. Balance your checkbook. No you guys I'm asking about writing checks to a group

339
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:45,340
of probably he's dead to a group of people that probably have never done it before. I forgot

340
00:58:45,340 --> 00:59:14,409
we're in the digital age. Digital zoomer. Only take checks though. I find that hard to believe.

341
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:25,260
All right so let me give you a scenario. Most of the time still even in the digital zoomer age

342
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:31,059
if like a plumber comes to your house you gotta pay them how do you pay them?

343
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:35,960
They don't have like a card swiper. Most of them are just like yeah it'd be a check

344
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:49,179
cash. All right so but what if the job you're paying for is like hundreds of dollars?

345
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:54,699
Do you just like withdraw like fucking eight hundred dollars in cash and like bang oh there's

346
00:59:54,699 --> 01:00:10,460
like eight hundreds. Why not? Yeah but then but you can't you can't prove it.

347
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:34,380
If you pay for a service in cash that money's gone. Receipt. What plumber is going to give

348
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:58,489
you a receipt? Never happened to me before. Oh this is cool. I give you I know I'm just

349
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:22,980
fucking around. Actual swinging animations. This is cool. Cell F. Bad plumbers.

350
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:32,389
Nah to be real though I don't ever carry cash. It's a hazard.

351
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:55,849
The spider even has the oof. It's a pretty cool spider though. Is that the quest? List

352
01:01:55,849 --> 01:02:04,090
of prisoners. John. Murder. Cell B empty. Cell C. Brigitte theft. Cell E. David murder. Cell F.

353
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:11,880
Censored. Boris. Conspiracy. Edita. Tax evasion. Cell I. Someone please get rid of that ugly

354
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:22,460
spider. Charlie. Murder. Kevin. Gambling. Let's go check on Kevin. It's okay. Why would you get

355
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:43,739
arrested for gambling? Dead for conspiracy. Illegal gambling. Oh okay. Cell block. Who's

356
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:50,739
in this one? Shift schedule. 6 a.m. 2 p.m. 2 p.m. 10 p.m. 10 p.m. 6 a.m. No please

357
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:54,900
stop using empty cell L as a storage for your items. Thanks. From the captain.

358
01:02:55,619 --> 01:03:12,469
Well I picked it up. It was a health potion. Sleeping quarters. That's actually scary how that

359
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:26,019
moves. You and the captain make it happen. Kevin grunt. My crunch berries. I had trouble

360
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:42,309
sleeping tonight again. Another nightmare about monsters attacking our fort. Kitchen.

361
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:58,579
Whoop. You gotta start. Yeah you're right. Oh fuck. I fucked up big time. Oh no. What am I

362
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:06,389
thinking? I'm doing like American humor and American references. That's not gonna work

363
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:16,420
right now. Fuck. Why are you guys still doing some like EU references and like British and

364
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:22,659
German Lithuanian humor. What do you guys think is funny? I don't know. I've never even

365
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:33,110
spoken to you guys before. It's been a long time. This is like going and being like a comedian

366
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:44,099
and going to like do stand-up and you look out. Where am I doing my next show? Oh we're

367
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:49,739
getting you on a plane and you're going to Germany. What? Yeah none of your material is

368
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:58,329
gonna work. Okay um I can figure something out. You really bombed with that NA check joke. I

369
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:06,090
know right? That's the problem. I thought that was gonna fly over really well. Current

370
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:10,889
inventory. Bunch of apples. Two healing potions. Someone please order more food immediately.

371
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:24,070
This captain sounds pretty uh. The EU is like five years more advanced than America.

372
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:37,210
I don't know if I believe that. Five? Like you're talking to an American right now.

373
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,969
You think I'm gonna stand for that? You think I'm gonna let that just fly and you're

374
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:48,230
gonna come after and attack my country? A country who every single business you've

375
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:58,070
gone into in the last at least five years are still running on Dell computers and Windows XP.

376
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:08,460
You think you're five to ten years ahead of us Americans? Are you out of your mind?

377
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:16,920
These skeletons are actually really well made. So it's actually kind of funny.

378
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,679
This is a universal humor. This has nothing to do with where you're from.

379
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,119
Right? Let's see. Tell me how this one flies. It's a reference to what we were just talking

380
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:32,039
about. So I was at the bank and this actually happened. I was setting up some account stuff.

381
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:37,079
I was squaring away some account details and this is a giant boss room so hold on.

382
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,519
You guys have banks in the EU right? Yeah so I'm already off to a great start as you can see.

383
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:57,900
Gotta make sure I don't die to the finale but anyways so I was having my

384
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:21,539
don't die. I'm gonna die. EU uses only Apple Pay. An American company I see. Come on. No!

385
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:40,710
That's it. I didn't do it. I have done too long. Too long NA. You know too long North

386
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:53,159
American. What's going on? All right TLDR EU. I went to the bank and they were on a Dell computer

387
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:57,800
and the computer crashed in the middle of doing my information and the guy was really upset.

388
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,440
He's like I can't believe this is happening man like what the fuck why does this have to

389
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:26,869
happen? I'm like I don't worry about it and then I just was curious. Okay I did it. So but

390
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:34,100
I was just curious so I asked him. I said what are you running on that's causing this many problems

391
01:08:34,659 --> 01:08:39,539
and this is the really scary shit that I think about this. Really wrap your mind around this

392
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:48,810
shit. So this person told me that his browser crashes all the time. He's on Windows XP.

393
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:57,300
Probably no security updates in a fucking decade and it was an old Dell computer

394
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:05,319
and I'm just sitting there thinking like this is like banking information. Your browser is

395
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:11,449
crashing. Your browser is crashing. I almost wanted to be like can you like get out of the

396
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:21,159
way for a minute and like sit in his chair and fix his computer but if that's the case

397
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:27,960
and they were they were very very adamant to tell me that this bank was not going to give

398
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,199
them updates and give them new computers and stuff. I'm just sitting there going you take

399
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:36,680
how do these I mean oh I can't believe it. How did that major breach happen?

400
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,279
I don't know maybe it's because this guy had Bonzi buddy installed on his computer and it

401
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:57,289
infected the entire fucking network of like eight million customers. What? I couldn't believe it.

402
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:08,649
Yeah well we here at we here at BankX yeah we we're very take we take security very

403
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:15,369
seriously. We have an entire team of people that make up like at least four to five probably

404
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:23,289
a million dollars in salaries. Your salary is very important to your security is very important

405
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:33,050
to us. Oh yeah? Yeah. Can you give all your branches new computers with updated Windows

406
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:41,460
security fixes? No no I don't think so. Why? That cost too much money we have

407
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:49,859
security experts that uh we pay the security experts uh okay I don't know what they do but

408
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:59,220
they are experts at it. Can you at least give them Windows 7? How much that gonna cost?

409
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:05,220
I don't know is it worth that or worth like a 10 million customers data breach because of

410
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:13,399
browser hijacker? I don't get it I never will and the EU crowd fucking loves this shit you know

411
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:23,079
what it means because like EU I gotta make this jump. Next game no no no way I have to make

412
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:45,579
this jump. It made this one really hard but it it's honestly it makes no sense.

413
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:03,100
That was unfinished that's it. Fall damage from spawning in.

414
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:17,560
Uh factory run let's try this one but no like we take security very seriously.

415
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:25,699
Can I just call and uh yeah I'm gonna use social engineering to trick one of your customer

416
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:38,329
service agents. Hi yes uh Bank uh BankX. Hi uh I'd like to make a withdrawal please.

417
01:12:39,579 --> 01:12:49,260
Okay uh who am I speaking to? Jeremy Albertson. Okay uh just for security purposes I want to

418
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,260
make sure that we get this and make sure we know who you are. Uh by the way replace this

419
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,979
with any fucking company any any company that has a feature like this. Uh can you do me a

420
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:06,260
favor and verify uh your first and last name? Jeremy Albertson. Okay all right just making

421
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:17,699
sure I'm talking to the right person. What would you like to do today? Take everything.

422
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:22,420
Okay take everything. Okay let me let me just like turn to my page in my script.

423
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:29,560
Okay to take everything um I'm gonna need a little bit more verifiable information.

424
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,439
I'm gonna need the last four digits of your phone number.

425
01:13:38,100 --> 01:14:11,670
Oh thank god I know I'm talking to the right person now. Sure through space this is look at

426
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:21,689
this shit. But it's true though all these companies claim to how well we take security

427
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:30,779
seriously. No you don't stop shut up. It's bullshit somebody you know people like people

428
01:14:30,859 --> 01:14:35,659
okay if it's possible for somebody to walk into like a target or like a gas station

429
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:40,939
and literally put like a credit card skimmer in their machine I don't think they're paying

430
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:56,840
that much attention to it. How did somebody swipe 500 credit cards? Oh there was a skimmer in

431
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:15,930
this ATM. Whoops how did that get there? Pull it out. This is really cool. This is a full

432
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:25,300
space station. People tap people's pockets with contactless credit card bridges and

433
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,340
take loads of money to time. I know it's it's it's like scary though you know what I mean? Like I

434
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,529
you gotta be careful under construction. Well let's just let's check this out.

435
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:48,390
You yeah here's the crazy part about the chip right? A lot of people don't take the chip.

436
01:15:51,109 --> 01:16:04,380
A ton of retailers don't do the chip. This is cool and they even have a thing on the device

437
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:10,659
that says chip reader not functioning please swipe. What do you mean it's not functioning?

438
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:21,539
It's broken. What are you talking about? Welcome to through space. For now it's just a dream.

439
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:27,060
I'm building this environment and doing some experimentation but through space will eventually

440
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,420
evolve to a story-driven sci-fi game. Gradually lore and more detail will be added.

441
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:43,300
Keep in touch. I could have just pressed the triangle. Chips mean fries for EU. Fuck you're

442
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:54,579
right. I meant um a credit card um internal chip like computer chip. This is actually really

443
01:16:54,579 --> 01:17:01,930
nice. I like the ground too. Oh now I get it. He's dude he's just slaying this EU audience.

444
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:20,420
Computer fries. I like this one. Good job. Very good job. You can say Europe Jeremy.

445
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:32,649
EU is just a treaty. All right well excuse me. Hold on a second. Wait wait wait wait wait

446
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:51,210
then why do you call it NA? North America is more than one country. So excuse me. This is hard.

447
01:17:52,329 --> 01:18:20,390
Europe is not EU? Wait what are you talking about? What are you talking about?

448
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:33,770
And NA is a shitload of countries. What are you talking about?

449
01:18:34,489 --> 01:18:54,979
Are people just fucking with me here? Oh I see.

450
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:06,279
I thought you guys were fucking with me. Did we already see this?

451
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:13,460
Is it because I said North America and everyone just thinks North America is

452
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:24,020
America? I forgot EU audience. I did say North America. NA is like three countries. All right

453
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:36,939
now you're just proving that you don't know. It's it's like 30 or 40 at least. Can I not

454
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:53,350
go in any of these doors? I get the fuck. This is cool. It's 20 23 what I say 30?

455
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,479
30 like what? So I didn't know I don't have the exact number of countries in North America.

456
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:10,340
I thought it was like 27. This is this is the first game I've played that has a really

457
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:20,229
well-made third person swinging animations. Central America is North America. Yeah yeah yeah

458
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:44,180
yeah it's a it's a hemisphere. This is fantastic. Oh yeah I forgot. Aerial attack,

459
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:57,449
jump attack. A lot of work went into this. This is really good. Hold this is block,

460
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:09,640
crouch. This looks like a little prototype. Focus camera and lock on. Wow somebody's gonna make

461
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:20,859
something awesome. Hold L2 and then back flip. So this is like Zelda game. There's even more.

462
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:30,170
Sprint, a roll. Oh yeah. Finisher attack after one second sprint.

463
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:35,420
Sprint dive.

464
01:21:38,859 --> 01:22:01,829
What is this one? This is just okay. So there is a suicide button I guess. Looks like they're

465
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:10,069
gonna have enemies scattered around. This is really well done. Can I give this a thumbs up

466
01:22:10,069 --> 01:22:16,659
plus? Can I give this more than a thumbs up? Because this is this is obviously somebody that

467
01:22:16,659 --> 01:22:21,539
knows exactly what the fuck they're doing. This is probably a this is a dev. This is a

468
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:34,229
dev and I put that in huge brackets. Like this is a dev. You can tell. You can just tell they

469
01:22:34,229 --> 01:23:00,090
know exactly what's going on. Like in quotes like dev. Nice job. Pixel plaza.

470
01:23:05,239 --> 01:23:09,560
I don't like this. I don't like this one. This one gives me a headache.

471
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:26,939
I gotta get out. I can't do that one. Boom balls hub one. Review tubes games presents a very small

472
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:29,899
percentage of you to make sure that the seizure from blackout comes from a certain life.

473
01:23:29,899 --> 01:23:35,529
We've got a warning for this one but not the last one. That was a a seizure warning at the

474
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:56,520
bottom but not the last one. Well it's there. I just don't know why. Really really good.

475
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:12,380
Oh shit. Trench bucket intro scene. Another super quotes dev. I don't mean that as like a

476
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:28,680
mean annoying way to be like oh yeah a dev quotes right? Cable car? So strange time of the year

477
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:33,750
to be going up in the mountains isn't it? What are you doing here? None of your business.

478
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:42,949
Pretend I didn't hear. By they do get deaf young these days don't they? Don't they? He's

479
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:50,710
trying to goad me into a conversation. Not on my watch. These lips are staying tightly closed

480
01:24:50,710 --> 01:25:09,460
mister. Looks like it's my stop. Ha! I win. If I had the skill to do it I would just take the first

481
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:14,489
like eight pages that I wrote of the book and make it a game.

482
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,520
Oh it looks like my stuff isn't far away either. Finally who knew a two hour cable

483
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:44,890
car could take so long. I'm a dev. I can do it. Boom balls pipe drink level one and start.

484
01:25:45,689 --> 01:26:13,210
Press and hold X to explode. Reaction game. Flawless. Galactic geometry dream evolved.

485
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:18,170
Coming soon. Advanced scoring system. Many update notes. Bug fences. Spawn invincibility

486
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:22,250
added. Update 04. Spawning patterns. Score chasers be aware that the future updates

487
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:46,229
the peak. Some of you guys are talking shit about this one. You sure about that?

488
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:52,329
I can check my pockets in any notes I've made using the touchpad. I can look at my

489
01:26:52,329 --> 01:26:56,779
messages too. Come to think of it didn't someone message me on the cable car?

490
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:09,189
I want to see if there's fall damage. Mobile phone. Cable car ticket. My one of my one line

491
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:13,109
of communication with the outside world. Mobile phone. Check my messages on a different page.

492
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:20,539
Messages from mum. Are you all right? Is your phone out of battery?

493
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,840
Just checking in. Hi sweetie how are you? I just dropped all your flat to say hello

494
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:32,020
but you won't get the EU crowd loving this one. Just dropped by your flat to say hello but you

495
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:39,300
weren't in. When I asked old Giuseppi next door he said he hadn't seen you for a few days.

496
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:45,109
Have you gone on another one of your trips? You don't need to tell me everything you do

497
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:49,430
but a bit of a heads up would be nice. Please give me a ring soon love mum.

498
01:27:49,430 --> 01:28:12,979
Well then this stream right now. How's your mum? My mum is doing good. This is beautiful.

499
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:23,289
Perfect. Wonderful. I envy being able to do this. Envy it. The EU is not British.

500
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:32,199
Oh yeah all right. Ring ring ring ring. Looks like my phone's ringing. It's from

501
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:38,310
Gregory sweet cheeks. We really need to have a serious talk. I've taken a glance

502
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:43,689
over your focus group report and I must say I'm not pleased by what I saw. I can see a pattern

503
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:49,100
emerging in your work. It's not a good one. I'm afraid to say that this is not acceptable

504
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,779
and you will need to step it up a little bit here. You're going to have to put in extra

505
01:28:52,779 --> 01:29:02,039
hours to complete. Unacceptable my behind. He should have seen what I had to work with.

506
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:05,239
I worked late all of last week to get him more finished and this is what I get.

507
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:11,079
More overtime at a glance than never this fucking mate. Well whatever. I'm on holiday.

508
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:30,979
Work can wait. Ring ring. Ring ring. Again. We really need to have a serious talk.

509
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:39,739
I meant going not gone. LOL. What part of holiday leave does this man not understand?

510
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:44,539
All right so this is what's happening right now is when I'm trying to do this

511
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:50,699
in real time you have an accent slider and you're playing back the audio clip of me talking and

512

sound test successful yeah this is really well made beach you got some good foliage but let's

542
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:49,609
uh let's see oh you made sure that you put invisible walls up good for you nice work

543
01:37:49,609 --> 01:37:52,569
because i was about to go look at it on the other side and see your assets that you

544
01:37:52,569 --> 01:37:57,479
accidentally painted over here but you're a good game dev and you may be not able to

545
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:16,039
no this is nice i mean it looks good this little campfire is cool the logs now you'll

546
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:22,119
notice a true sculptor at work here because those are the cylinder shape that had been hollowed

547
01:38:22,119 --> 01:38:29,579
out but instead of just doing that painting them brown and maneuvering them and putting them in

548
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:35,659
the fire do you see the etchings on the lungs they went with the little ball tool and they

549
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:47,220
sculpted out etchings resident sleepers apparently the apparently the eu audience is

550
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:54,100
not uh doesn't care about artistically inclined things the the north american audience was

551
01:38:54,100 --> 01:39:02,060
like all over this just want to make sure you're aware of that we were talking about etchings and

552
01:39:02,619 --> 01:39:07,739
and clay and stuff apparently north america was more interested in art and i'm interested

553
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:18,970
i'm learning a lot today no one cares

554
01:39:30,819 --> 01:39:38,739

632
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,920
the developer always puts in like a secret and it's just driving a straight line

636
02:00:23,819 --> 02:00:47,850
but he didn't yeah tason day the audio is distinct what which one the

637
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:51,930
game audio that doesn't make this weird that's a nice touch it was like the ghost

638
02:00:52,649 --> 02:01:21,579
it's the game did what did that just start happening it's been happening really i don't

02:02:15,289 --> 02:02:23,420
you know for people that didn't see it the first time somebody made pt but i might as well

645
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:36,840
to show you the first loop because it's amazing that somebody did this the day of the

first i i don't i don't know what it is to what it's a trap of i don't know i don't know

983
03:26:15,690 --> 03:26:30,889
that means did i just say something wrong i don't know don't tell them whatever i don't know any

984
03:26:30,889 --> 03:26:41,219
of these things i thought that was a game in dreams anyways uh thanks for the 250 uh thank you

985
03:26:41,219 --> 03:26:44,979
ned for the three dollars if you like dream sculpting you should try a vr sculpting program

986
03:26:44,979 --> 03:26:51,979
like sculptor vr they are quite fun i think the next time i do dreams sculpting will be

987
03:26:51,979 --> 03:26:59,139
with the move controllers feel like it's way better because you actually can move your hand

988
03:26:59,139 --> 03:27:03,459
around it's not tilting around a controller with your wrists i feel like with if i if i

989
03:27:03,459 --> 03:27:08,819
had two hands being able to hold things and sculpt around it i'd probably do a lot better

990
03:27:10,340 --> 03:27:18,739
it feels so good with them yeah i'm looking forward to it but yeah sculptor via maybe i'll

991
03:27:18,739 --> 03:27:24,819
