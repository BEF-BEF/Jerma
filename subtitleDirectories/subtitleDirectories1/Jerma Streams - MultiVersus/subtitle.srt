1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:11,830
How you doing? What's happening? How you been? Good?

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,600
Please play with Steven Universe. I'm sorry, no.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,940
I don't have anything against Steven Universe. It just...

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,789
Tasmanian Devil is a selectable character, so

5
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,070
that's who I'm going to play with.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,670
And by the way, where's Daffy? I just want to get that out of the way. Where

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,109
is he? I think there's probably a bug in my game.

8
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:40,149
Some kind of a... probably a data that I had verify integrity of game cache. I

9
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,049
don't see Daffy Duck as a selectable character.

10
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:51,530
I'm not sure what's going on in my game, but... So what are we doing?

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,219
We're going to play multi-versus. I got access to the Alpha,

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,000
or whatever this is, the early access of it. It ends

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,840
in about two hours, so I want to check it out for a couple hours and

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,769
see how it is. Daffy Duck got fired from WB.

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:21,159
You don't fire a cartoon character? What? Nice milk voice?

16
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,879
Why do I know what you're talking about? I hate that I know what you're talking

17
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:34,200
about. Nice milk voice. Is it though? Is it... I mean,

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:45,349
maybe a little bit milky, but... What did this person say?

19
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:48,390
I got immediately used to the new mic. It sounds neat now.

20
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,250
Oh cool, thanks. Just to let you know, I haven't...

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,689
I haven't fixed anything with this mic. Anything, since the first time you heard

22
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:02,219
me use it during the horror games. I kind of sat down and opened up the

23
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,260
compressor and just got... I was just like, I don't care.

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,030
And then I said, I'll fix it later. It's not laziness.

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,050
It's not laziness. It's almost like a disdain for having to do it,

26
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,139
because there's so many little knobs I have to

27
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,659
twist and stuff, and move, and drag, and sliders, and

28
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,939
the attack, and the release time, and I'm just like, I don't fucking, I don't care

29
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,400
right now. I think it's okay. So it's laziness.

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,360
No, it's a disdain for needing to have to do it in the first place. It's not

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,199
laziness. Tweaking audio is the worst. Okay, you know

32
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,639
what it is? I set the whole thing up, and it took me like an hour or two to

33
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,120
get this where I want it, and what I want it to be like.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,000
And then I got to mess with a bunch of knobs after messing with the knobs, and

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,469
then the knobs weren't in the right place. I'm just like, you know what?

36
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll do it eventually. I'll figure it out. So don't worry.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:11,740
He's lazy. Next person. We're playing multiverses, and you need to stop.

38
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:23,539
It's disdained laziness. But how you doing? Hope everyone's

39
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:31,539
all right. Hope you're having a good day. My day is going pretty well. I think it's

40
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:36,500
time that we moved over. By the way, after this, because I gotta

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,699
get going. We gotta go, because I only have until 5 p.m. Pacific.

42
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:45,879
Did I watch Obi-Wan Kenobi? No, I didn't. I own almost every Star Wars shirt that

43
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,580
they've released in the last four or five years, but I've only seen

44
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,300
the goddamn milk voice. That's the only one I've seen. I've seen the only

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:06,460
the new one. The new movie. I haven't seen any of the new shows really.

46
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,419
He's in Fortnite now. I know, right? Yeah. Do a watch party? I'm not going to do a

47
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,620
watch party. All right, so anyways, after this, there's a few games that I want to

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,959
play. It's going to be a mystery game, so hope you're ready.

49
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:28,519
So let's go. You guys ready? What's up? And because we're playing, it's

50
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,209
Warner Brothers. Hold on, let me make sure. Do I have a fly down?

51
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:43,139
Did you shave? Yeah, I did. But because it's a Warner Brothers game, I decided I

52
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:51,300
was gonna wear Aquaman. The shirt is so tight now. I don't think this shirt ever

53
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,750
fit me. This is a classic shirt, but I don't think it ever fit me for real.

54
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,870
And now I've gained probably like another 10 pounds or so, and it's

55
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,050
it definitely doesn't fit at all. It's very, very tight. You outgrew your kids'

56
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,329
clothes. And I gotta get a haircut too. I don't like what my hair looks like

57
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,389
today. Okay, you guys ready? Look at it. It's all

58
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:22,649
fucked up. It's all bunched up over here. I got to slick it back.

59
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:26,860
That looks okay. Not really, but whatever. You look like a vampire. Whatever.

60
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,740
All right, so here we go. We're gonna play... Who should I play with

61
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,259
first? I did the basic tutorial. It just plays just like Smash Brothers, except

62
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:45,339
it's pretty much 2v2, right? So let's go. Let me just do 1v1. This is

63
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,850
the teams. Let me just do 1v1. Let me just try it for now.

64
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,779
Should I play online already? What if I don't know what the fuck I'm doing?

65
00:05:53,779 --> 00:06:04,759
Can you guys hear it? I should be able to hear it now. All right, 1v1.

66
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:12,629
Choose one. Okay, let's go. Cross play. That's fine. All right, should I be

67
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:21,180
Shaggy? Shaggy's a bruiser. Rain Dog. Who is Rain Dog? There's no

68
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,430
background music. Oh, it's because I turned on the streamer mode, so it

69
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,379
removes, I think, everything. Bugs Bunny. I was looking at

70
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:39,589
Tasmanian Devil. I'm gonna do Taz. Experimental. All right,

71
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:44,600
Summertime Taz. I don't... I can't... I don't have that yet. Is the game good?

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:56,230
What is all this for? Oh, what's this? Oh, dude, Hustle Town game!

73
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,750
I looked like a fucking... I was made out of taffy for a second. When I

74
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,230
leaned into the mic, I looked over here and I looked like I was made out of

75
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:09,750
fucking clay. It was weird. Alanna's to always...

76
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:20,310
All right, let's go. My mic cut that off. What did you hear?

77
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,000
The mic cut you off. You didn't hear me say, oh my god, Chalky Arian!

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh, Aria Stark! What are perks? I don't care.

79
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,490
It's called... Do I have to pick a perk? I don't have any perks.

80
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,129
Onion... Onion Stark.

81
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,689
Taz, Onion Stark! This is fucking loud.

82
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:53,740
All right, let's go. No perks, no perks. I don't even know what's going on.

83
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,970
It's the first time I've ever played this. First to get two ringouts wins.

84
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,329
I have no intention of letting someone else be the victor. I was like, that's not

85
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:19,939
Taz. Why are we playing on this stage? All right, so you got the bite.

86
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:30,709
All right, what's that? Attack down. Oh, burp!

87
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:43,580
Oh, you got... I got Salt and Pepper too. Oh, shit! All right, that's what I can do.

88
00:08:43,899 --> 00:09:15,769
Oh! Oh! Oh my god!

89
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,289
Why am I a turkey? Oh, no, that's not me. That's her.

90
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,279
Oops.

91
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:16,279
This is fun. This is fun. This is actually pretty fun. This is fun.

92
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,440
There's no music. Why is there no music?

93
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,590
No, I... Let me go to the music section. Good fight. That was actually pretty fun.

94
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,649
Let me... Let me... Hold on a second here. Oh, let's give a toast.

95
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,490
I toasted. Okay. Oh, all right. All right, let me tell you something right now.

96
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,740
Let's put the OST. Put on Looney Tunes music. It's on streamer mode. Oh, I'll fix it.

97
00:10:51,779 --> 00:11:01,029
Excuse me, though. This runs fucking unbelievable. The problem that I always have, and I'm not

98
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:09,860
fucking around. I'm not making this up. Input delay and lag in an online match is unbearable

99
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,700
in every fighting game I've ever played. I just can't do it. I literally can't play them.

100
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,179
I didn't even feel like I was playing online. This is not an ad. No, it's not. This is not

101
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,539
a sponsored stream. I just got access to the game. Trust me when I say there is almost no

102
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:32,919
input lag, at least in that match. I'm going to give it a little bit more time. What is that?

103
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:41,379
Does this use rollback netcode? I don't know. But holy shit, that felt phenomenal. That actually

104
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,639
felt fantastic. You know what I'm talking about when you play a game online, a fighting game,

105
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:56,100
especially, and you press A to do a move and it's like, hey, hey, jump, jump. It's like,

106
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,230
I'm not playing. I'm literally, I'm literally not going to play. I can't do it. I physically

107
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:07,299
can't play. That felt really good. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What do I have to do? Turn

108
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,860
off? What do I have to turn off? Streamer mode? Should I try something on the character?

109
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:25,259
This is fun. I'm excited. Audio, streamer mode. We're, we're in line at the Superman ride.

110
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:37,639
Why did I turn this off? Oh dude, it's so sick. I can't believe it. We can just walk through the

111
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:45,000
whole queue and not experience any of the queue experience and just get like half of whatever that

112
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,679
was, that movie, that like four minute movie they're playing. I guess I'm seeing 10 seconds of it.

113
00:12:50,679 --> 00:13:08,659
Say goodbye to the VOD, whatever. Let's try bugs. Batman's locked? I really like this. I think it's

114
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:15,029
because I won. Every time I play Smash Brothers Online or a fighting game online, I get fucking,

115
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,000
what's the term, beat up? It's bad. I can't even like play. I can't even have fun.

116
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:36,340
It's called rolled, obliterated, decimated. All right, I got a match. Uh oh. All right,

117
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,590
versus Wonder Woman. I mean, unlock your first perk bar. I get mastery level two. All right.

118
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,190
All right, let's go. Is Seinfeld going to be in the game? Are you serious?

119
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:04,179
All right, I don't, I don't know how to play with any of these characters. All I know is they have

120
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,620
cartoon moves. If you have a cartoon move, I'm going to be, you're going to be fine.

121
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:49,179
Let's two ring out. I like this. Oh, what stage is this? Oh, that's a, okay, that's a stun.

122
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:03,139
I don't know what his fucking moves is. I just hit myself with my own rocket.

123
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:33,850
He, okay, that's, what the fuck was that? Oh, oh, there comes a comeback.

124
00:15:48,009 --> 00:16:05,419
Oh shit. What the fuck just happened? I got a pie.

125
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:50,340
What the hell's that? Sorry. All right. My hands are so greasy. My hands are greasy.

126
00:16:51,379 --> 00:17:36,180
You have no idea how greasy I am right now. It's bad. Oh, that's it.

127
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:44,339
I'm so greasy. You have no idea. I'm covered in fucking oil.

128
00:17:44,980 --> 00:18:06,420
To do it to him. He's actually cracked. Not really. I just itched my ass on camera.

129
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:20,329
What? Why? I'm tired. I just like woke up. What the fuck am I doing? I'm fine. I'm fine.

130
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:31,980
I got a new unlock. I got a new utility perk. Copyzilla. We don't care. That's fine. I don't

131
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:42,490
care either. Fucking self report, self-made problem. Try play as Shaggy. This game's fucking

132
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,589
fun. I was so concerned going into this because I saw all the advertisements. I'm like, okay,

133
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm not so sure. Maybe this is just first time playing. I haven't played a game like this in

134
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:11,099
a while, but this feels clean. This feels really clean and really good. I have emotes too. No,

135
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:16,869
I swear to God, this isn't even an ad. I promise you, this is not an ad. I just got access to the

136
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:39,160
game. I promise. I promise this is not sponsored. What? Oh, all right. So I can practice.

137
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:53,700
So everybody has a combo, right? He doesn't. Okay. Who am I fighting? Uh oh. I'm fighting.

138
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,450
It's uh oh. I'm fighting Chad Shaggy. This person's a level 10 Shaggy. I'm going to get fucking

139
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:48,410
destroyed. I'm scared. Weak Shaggy. What are all these? Uh oh. Let's go. Oh my God. I forgot

140
00:20:48,410 --> 00:22:06,549
how to play. How's he doing that move? Where'd he get a sandwich? Oh, whatever. He had a perk. I

141
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:40,740
didn't have any perks. Whatever. I had perks. I don't have perks. That was fun. You know what?

142
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,480
I like, I think I like bugs. No, I got to play with every character at least once. How many,

143
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,589
how much time is left on this alpha? Oh my God. I can only play for like 40 minutes. Why didn't I

144
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:58,839
play this two days ago? Why didn't I do this like a week ago? I was so concerned. I was going to hate

145
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:10,099
it. Okay. I want to, who should I play with now? Do Tom and Jerry? All right. Hold on. Let me,

146
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:19,819
let me go into practice with Tom and Jerry. It's time to try teams. No.

147
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,940
How do I do just like a practice? Oh, here we go. Like advanced tutorials. No, I already know. I

148
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:37,480
kind of know that. Is there no practice? Oh no, there is practice. Yeah, there is. Okay. So let's

149
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,819
do Tom and Jerry. Dude, I can do pirate Tom and Jerry. Okay. So they run together. Everybody has

150
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:53,500
a double jump. Everybody has a charge. All right. That's like a three hit combo. One, two, three,

151
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:15,849
four. Pretty nice. Pretty nice. Up. Ooh. You get a pretty good combo there. Ooh. What? So all right,

152
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:29,609
regular special is you launch out Jerry. You can, excuse me? This seems advanced. This seems like

153
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:45,160
advanced techniques. That's a mouse trap. How do I get Jerry to come back? This is the hardest

154
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:56,339
character to play in the game. Okay. Well, I could probably see that. Dude, even that combo is insane.

155
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:10,920
How would you fight against this? This seems crazy. Oh, what if he dies? What's the fishing

156
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:24,069
line do? Is it a grab? Can't tell. Holy. Oh my God. If you can actually land that, that's crazy.

157
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:31,529
All right. Okay. That's cool. They're all right. They're kind of hard to play with. What about

158
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:47,049
Batman? Well, that's okay. Cool. All right. Batman. That's not ready. It's not ready.

159
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:55,579
Wait, I'm getting a, that spells not ready yet. That spells not ready yet.

160
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:13,700
This can't use that yet. All right. Batman's kind of cool. What is Batman's default spells?

161
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,319
All right. That's I don't, I don't know. Oh, that's the battery. Okay. Does it blows up too?

162
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:36,680
Doesn't it? Uppercut. Okay. What about down special? Ooh. Okay. Cool. What about Superman?

163
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,039
No, what about Velma? What does Velma do? Does that mean Scooby-Doo is going to be in the game too?

164
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:58,410
It has to be, right? Oh, I see. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I think I actually like,

165
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:14,819
I think I like Velma. That's the side. What about the charge? Okay. Up special is this weird potion.

166
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:37,849
Oh, it's a freeze. Why do I have a big head mode? What happened? All right. So side B is this like

167
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:44,390
run and you grab and then you, can you throw them off? You take them to the edge and then they bounce

168
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:54,150
backwards. Okay. All right. I like Velma. I'm going to try Velma. I think the next game. What is this?

169
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:14,259
Who's this Pokemon? Rain dog? Who's rain dog? What show is this from? All right. What's standard?

170
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:27,750
Actually kind of good. This is an OC character. Oh, really? All right. Seems kind of cool.

171
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:55,859
Be Jake. He's pretty, pretty, pretty good. All right. How about Jake? I like that three hit combo.

172
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:11,029
Two, three. What about, what about down attack? Nice. That's really good. Oh, he's super stretchy

173
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:21,420
too. All right. So what about standard special? It's a bite. Oh, okay. That's a cool down.

174
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,750
All right. That was pretty cool. Or what about down special? You turn into a house.

175
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm imagining, right. Okay. It's like Pac-Man. All right. What about side? Turn into a horse.

176
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:44,150
That's up special. That's pretty cool. All right. So could I, so let's, let's do a little bit of a

177
00:29:44,150 --> 00:30:09,589
combo here. So check this out. Ready? Oops. No. Oh, all right. Cool. Nice combo. Whatever. Oh,

178
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:26,539
what about Steven Universe? Standard punch. Okay. That's a three hit combo. Why is it a bubble?

179
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:37,609
That's pretty cool. Side smash, up smash, uppercut. All right. What about specials?

180
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:56,740
What the hell is that? So that's a projectile defense. Okay. What about up? What the fuck?

181
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:17,109
What can I jump? Can I jump on them? Oh my God. I can jump on them. Holy shit. You can knock them

182
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:24,150
into the, um, all right. That's advanced techniques. Pretty cool though. All right. What about garnet?

183
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:38,410
All right. I like that multiple hit combo. What about down? That's very far reaching.

184
00:31:42,519 --> 00:32:03,450
Seems incredibly powerful. All right. Wow. What a fun game. Jesus, man. What am I doing?

185
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:11,460
I'm so unaware of the weird gross things I'm doing today. All right. What about, uh, up?

186
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:50,819
Do you put these stars out? All right. Pretty sick. What about Superman? Oh, Ari Stark. All

187
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:58,549
right. Very quick. I feel like this is going to be a, a meta character. Lots of fast movement

188
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:18,359
slashes, tons of fucking movement speed. All right. Sick. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to

189
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:33,259
play around as Belma. Oh, I still want to do 1v1. Oh my God. I forgot what Jake and Finn are,

190
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:42,099
Finn's in this. I didn't even see them. All right. What do you got for stuff?

191
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,970
What about your perks? I don't, I don't have any perks. All right. Belma versus Steven universe.

192
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:09,349
See, I don't have any perks. Equip all. Let's go. I don't have any perks. See? All right. We're both

193
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:27,539
level one. It's fine. Not one of these matches has felt laggy. Not one. And that gosh darn it.

194
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:35,699
I mean it. I feel like I'm connected with a ethernet cable to this other person's computer.

195
00:34:39,860 --> 00:35:24,250
What's that? You went through the stage. Get away from me. Oh my God. Don't fall off the

196
00:35:24,250 --> 00:37:39,380
waves. All right. Sorry. I got 60%. I got 60%. What was that sound? I feel like I'm not playing

197
00:37:39,380 --> 00:38:01,929
her correctly. You look like the annoying orange. What are you talking about? Am I level two yet?

198
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:29,769
Oh, I got some boxes. Oh, I got a perk. Cool. Collection. Oh, okay. Gold times a hundred. Okay.

199
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:38,570
So I have this. Your team receives 10% reduced ability cooldown. How do I put that on? This taunts

200
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:51,420
too. All right. I'm going to play bugs and I'm going to do team fight. Let's try it. Team fight.

201
00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:10,630
Choose your character. This is a rare. Whoa. All right. Cool. I don't, I can't do anything,

202
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:25,320
sort of. Definitely going to put this on. All right. So it's 2v2. I love this. These kids

203
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:50,099
game Tuber reactions. I'm actually excited. These kids game. Double fucking Batman. What the hell is

204
00:39:50,099 --> 00:40:12,570
this? Is this allowed? At least we have perks. Prepare yourself. All right. I actually would

205
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:26,679
probably bet on this team. If this were real. I think you're the toughest I've gone up against.

206
00:40:26,679 --> 00:41:36,179
Let's go. Watch out. Oh, got him. Slowed him. He slowed. He slowed. Got him. Good interrupt.

207
00:41:36,659 --> 00:42:28,090
Shit. Oh, got him. Sorry. Sorry. Don't let him get away. Don't let him get away.

208
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:59,579
Nice job. I got carried. No, I didn't. I got carried. That was a good team effort.

209
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:28,920
That was a team effort, man. Equal effort. Yeah. Although I am in the, okay, so all the level ones,

210
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,260
this is why I love playing a new fighting game right when it comes out. Because all of us,

211
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,449
every single person besides a small percentage of people, we're all just kind of pressing buttons.

212
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:51,539
It's great. I love it. We're all just kind of still, I don't even, I don't even know what

213
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:55,940
Bugs's downbeat even really does. I know it goes underground,

214
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:04,139
but I mean, everybody else thinks that too. It's great. Prepare for my dectifying exploits.

215
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:17,639
Say hi to my uncle. Hey, you know what? I don't even care. Just fuck the whole thing up.

216
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:37,059
What is going on? I do look like a big kid. What's happening right now? I look like a big kid.

217
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:58,119
What's going on? That's better. Put it to a middle part. I don't think I can even do

218
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:11,500
a middle part. I don't, I actually don't think I can do a middle part. That was just wet.

219
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:18,460
Please put glasses on. All right. I got to pay attention to this. I'm like, I'm like seven in

220
00:45:18,460 --> 00:46:55,699
one right now. Shit. What's wrong with me? Oh, how did he fucking miss that? I'm gonna

221
00:46:55,699 --> 00:47:01,400
fall off of this motherfucker's 143 Fahrenheit. That guy's at 143 degrees Fahrenheit. Fucking

222
00:47:01,400 --> 00:48:16,550
get rid of him. Finally. Shit. Look at this. 420 damage. I'm starting to understand, but I

223
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:24,889
didn't throw it. What are you talking about? I didn't jump out of bounds. I'm starting to

224
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:33,179
understand Bugs Bunny's moves. You got to pick somebody and just play. That's the only way.

225
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:41,829
You got to just play. I'm going Bugs. What about the chapstick? Thank God for reminding me.

226
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:55,769
Of course. Just play the game. Oh, they're both level one. I think we're fine. Is this the same

227
00:48:55,769 --> 00:49:22,309
person that I was with last time? More games for your wax face. What did I just witness? I don't

228
00:49:22,309 --> 00:51:05,289
know. Whatever. Let's do it. Oh, no. Oh, Jake, no. Stupid reactions. Oh, missed it out. Oh,

229
00:51:05,289 --> 00:52:03,619
my pie. Fuck you. I got to get a stun. Goodbye. What happened? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

230
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:07,219
we got it right there. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Don't worry.

231
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:23,449
I got it. I got it. We win. I feel like I went pretty cracked out right there.

232
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:46,940
Nice job. That was a nice game. That was a nice fight. Good job. Your lips are way too pink. I

233
00:52:46,940 --> 00:53:01,019
don't know what you want me to say, man. Your lips are too pink. Oh, all right. Cool. I'm enjoying

234
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:08,250
my multiverse game. What time is it? I have one hour to enjoy this. All right. One more match of

235
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:22,329
bugs. I mean, I'm going to go back to wait, money. Cool. I accept a rematch and teams are one v one.

236
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:32,650
What's the next game after this? I have I don't know. I downloaded like four things. I have

237
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:44,519
Sniper Elite five, the Miku game project, um, mega mix or something. And then I also have

238
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:51,829
Pac-Man museum, which I feel like I hold on a minute. Let me see. I know the kick kick into the

239
00:53:51,829 --> 00:54:04,230
bat. I like bugs is hold on a minute. His side air is really, really good. It's really powerful.

240
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:17,030
Use your character. I gotta stop spamming the mallet though. That sounds good to me.

241
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:24,329
What is this? Your team deals one additional damage when knocked back.

242
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:38,599
Enemies collide. Okay, cool. Oh, we got a mirror. Oh, what is that? That's fucking crazy.

243
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:57,960
That's crazy. That's, that's really powerful. I got it. What stage is this?

244
00:54:57,960 --> 00:56:20,940
Oh, I almost got it. Left trigger. How do I use this? Get out of here. Easy on the edge here.

245
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:38,980
Shit, that was close. I could, I got caught up. I got caught up. Yeah, let's go. Let's go again.

246
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:53,510
I feel like that was good teams. I threw. Let's go. No, I didn't. Let's do rematch.

247
00:57:53,510 --> 00:58:08,940
Choose your character. All right. I'm going to change it up a little bit here. Lord stock.

248
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:39,480
You must be thirsty. Snacks. Yeah, let's go. Snacks. Did you turn the swear filter off?

249
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:58,010
I don't know. Maybe. Can I get a birthday wish? Happy birthday. It's your birthday today.

250
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:11,610
Happy birthday. It's a kid's game. You need to stop sweating. I sweat all day, man. I could be

251
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:19,210
reading a book in bed and I'll just be like sweaty. Even if the book is, it could be a cookbook. It

252
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:33,289
doesn't matter what it is. Honestly, it does not matter. All right. Right off the bat. Go in.

253
00:59:33,289 --> 01:00:45,980
And I forgot how to press the button. This guy fucking fly up already. Holy shit. Do we have any

254
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:59,289
fucking power? Dude, fucking can we knock somebody off the fucking edge? I just spit a tooth out.

255
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,050
That's what it felt like.

256
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:06,360
At least he didn't eat me.

257
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:36,019
What's happening? I don't know what happened. I'm so fucking sweaty. Oh, what happened?

258
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,179
I didn't know you could hold on to the edge like that. I was like stuck to the edge. What was that?

259
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:54,300
Fuck. I was stuck to the edge. You're peeking your mic. I'm going to fucking break it in half.

260
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:11,449
Nice mic. All right. Taz is fun, but like I just, the up, his recovery move is not that great.

261
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:18,340
You can hold on to walls and climb back. Yeah, that freaked me out. I was just stuck on the wall.

262
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:26,969
I was just started mashing buttons. I was freaking out. All right. We're going back.

263
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:48,460
Oh, I was already in a party. Sorry. Can I buy some stuff versus the AI? Free for all?

264
01:03:48,460 --> 01:04:01,909
Foreplay of mayhem. Let's do some 1v1s. Let's go back to bugs.

265
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:25,769
I have a black eye? No, it's the shadow from like, uh oh, Tom and Jerry. That's good. All right. Let

266
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:38,840
me, like the 1v1 scenario, I think I'd be fine. Prepare yourself. Oh, the reacting YouTuber to

267
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:48,739
the fun new kids game. That's not, it's not even a kid's game. Batman's in this. That's T for teen.

268
01:04:48,739 --> 01:06:25,670
I'll beat you. All right. Leave me alone. I got to win a match. Oh, the bounce. Damn it.

269
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:33,429
Use this.

270
01:06:36,659 --> 01:07:27,380
Huh? Damn it. I want to end up with that. This is really funny. What? Piece of cake. I'm not a

271
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:36,260
victory in the continue. You know what? I got to get used to. So with the analog, when you press

272
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:42,579
up to do up smash or up air, whatever, sometimes I do left or right because the analog is still

273
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:54,760
thinking I'm pressing left and right when I'm trying to press up skill issue, skill issue.

274
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:14,090
It looks like a black eye. I think I'm just very red today. I shaved and I'm playing an intense

275
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:23,479
fighting game and I'm trying to do and I'm trying to get as much. Look,

276
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:27,000
I'm trying to just go, go, go, go, go, because I only have like 40 minutes left in the fucking

277
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:47,510
alpha. It's a smudge on the camera. I don't think so. It looks like you're wearing rogue,

278
01:08:48,619 --> 01:09:13,340
rouge, rogue blush. I'm just super excitable right now. I'm just super excitable. I'm playing a game

279
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:18,920
that I'm intensely paying attention. You know, I get shit on this channel all the time for dude,

280
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,479
fucking read the tutorial. Why are you walking into walls? Dude, you went in a circle five times.

281
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,760
I'm getting victories here and I'm getting red.

282
01:09:26,760 --> 01:12:11,189
Red. Oh, you caught me. Nice job. Nice job. Shit. What was that? How are you still alive?

283
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:38,760
That was crazy. Good fight. How are you still alive? You had 200%. Yeah, I know I did. You're

284
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:55,319
right. Look at this beautiful blushy boy. I need a haircut. I'm just sweating. It's not even blush

285
01:12:55,319 --> 01:13:12,119
people. Oh my God. He's blushing. No, I'm sweaty and in pain. That's it. Oh, he's blushy. Bugs again.

286
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:27,510
Let's go. This is actually really fun. Let me see something. So the air specials are different.

287
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:42,329
Choose your character. Okay. I got to drop that safe more often.

288
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:59,109
It reminds me of the Pac-Man fire hydrant from Smash. Prepare yourself. Oh my God. I haven't

289
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:07,850
blinked in an hour and 15 minutes. Clean the camera. There's nothing wrong with the camera.

290
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:48,550
Get your eyes checked.

291
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:36,979
All right. You morphed on him? Let's go again. That was a good one. That was intense.

292
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:50,810
You didn't speak at all? Yeah. I'm trying to win. I'm trying to play. Guys, I have to prove at

293
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:57,220
least once a year that I understand the concept of a video game. At least once every six months.

294
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:04,140
I have to at least prove to you guys that I can still drive the video game car sometimes.

295
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:20,949
This is fun as fuck too. God, I'm so happy. A fighting game. Finally, for the love of God,

296
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:27,720
I can actually play the game online. It's not I press a button and a half a second later,

297
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:42,119
the action happens. So explain to me while I play because I won't read it, but I'll

298
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:48,039
somebody will spam it to me later. Why is this so clean? Why is this so good?

299
01:18:38,680 --> 01:19:52,760
Oh, nice hit. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job.

300
01:20:27,350 --> 01:21:34,409
I got to get in there. I got to get in. He's getting too much range. Oh, I missed it.

301
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:40,149
Anyone taunt? Good job. That was insane. All right. One more. One more. This is a rematch.

302
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:47,210
Yeah, we got the best two out of three. Let's go. You look like a skin walker.

303
01:22:48,569 --> 01:22:52,890
I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? How's this? Is this better?

304
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:05,399
All right. This is this is for all the marbles. This is for all the marbles.

305
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:16,090
That was intense. God, it's I feel like that super villain that is so happy that finally there's a

306
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:20,649
challenge for him. You know what I mean? Like finally, finally I can play against somebody

307
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:39,699
that's intense and that feeling of fighting and strength. Finally. You look like Mega Mind.

308
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:44,840
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. This is this is it. Now I know why people play these.

309
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:50,380
I get it because my whole body is like kind of nervous. Is that weird? All right, let's go.

310
01:24:53,500 --> 01:25:39,079
Oh, my God. Do it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's happening? All right. All right. Let's go.

311
01:25:39,079 --> 01:26:16,979
Match point. Red team. You lost your friend.

312
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:48,329
Good fight. Good match. God damn. Damn. That was fun. Nice fight. I was really afraid that

313
01:26:48,329 --> 01:27:05,479
you're going to come back there. Oh, my goodness. I look 14. I have to stop shaving my face. I feel

314
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:09,079
like people look at me when I shave my face. They go, what's wrong? Why does he look so weird?

315
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:32,939
I understand what people are saying now. Holy shit. Oh, my God, dude. That looks crazy.

316
01:27:33,739 --> 01:27:38,260
All right, we got only got like 21 minutes till the alpha is over.

317
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:50,619
All right, we're going experimental here because I know I can play with bugs. Bugs is my main,

318
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:54,970
but I kind of want to just jump around as another character in the 20 minutes I have left.

319
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:15,739
What does Wonder Woman do? Let me go back. Okay. The thing about... Okay, but what about bugs is...

320
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:25,590
Oh, that's what that does. Okay. There's so many more combos I could have been doing.

321
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:39,720
If you're in the air, he paints it. I get it. Okay. Interesting. All right, let me see Wonder

322
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:50,409
Woman. What's the combo for Wonder Woman? Cool. One, two, three. The one thing I don't like about

323
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:56,010
bugs is bugs has kind of a weird combo. He just goes like this and you can miss it really easily.

324
01:28:56,729 --> 01:29:21,529
Okay. What is that? Oh, okay. Is that a pull? Oh, it's on a cooldown. That's like a little dash.

325
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:32,409
All right. Down special seems to be a shield, I think. Up special is this float and you can...

326
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:35,819
Okay. All right. I think it seems pretty self-explanatory.

327
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:48,180
It's a sword character. I'm wondering about that whip. All right. Let's go for it.

328
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:58,229
It seems cool. Sword Andy. I only got like 15 minutes to play this game.

329
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,939
We'll go back to teams. That's just fun to jump around.

330
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,170
And I am genuinely not fucking around. I know that we fuck around a lot on this channel and

331
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:30,199
I mean, and we tell a lot of jokes. This is very good. I mean, go ahead and say

332
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:35,560
add if you want. It really is. This is like the most fun I've played in a fighting game

333
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:49,560
since I was like fucking like 16 or something because it works. It looks really fun. I'm telling

334
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:57,000
you it is. All right. So while there's a few minutes here, why can this game play so well on

335
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:03,239
the internet? What is this thing people were saying? This like netcode thing. And why doesn't

336
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:15,699
every video game that's a fighting game use it? It's called rollback netcode. Prepare yourself.

337
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:20,260
For no reason. Is there a downside or something? Why wouldn't anybody use it?

338
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:30,300
It's really difficult to implement. It's pretty much arcane magic. It predicts what you were just

339
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:43,579
going to do. The infants of our tribe are stronger than you. Let's go. Shit.

340
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:27,979
Don't fall off the edge like an idiot. Oh wait, I just jumped. I'm giving my teammate that. What?

341
01:32:28,380 --> 01:33:06,789
In the future. There it is. One more, right? Blue team.

342
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:34,439
Oh, you fly to your teammate. All right. Red team.

343
01:33:44,949 --> 01:33:54,250
Oh, get that last hit. Oh my God. Kill. Kill before I die. I blew it. I blew it for us.

344
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,609
I blew it for us. Way too bad. I just didn't. I didn't know how high her thing went. It's the

345
01:33:57,609 --> 01:34:03,770
first time I played with her. I blew it. I just like didn't know how high the thing.

346
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:09,539
It's the first time I played with that character. Sorry. I'm sorry. It was fun. All right. New

347
01:34:09,539 --> 01:34:19,020
character. I threw and now I did. So it's really hard to implement this netcode. Who made this

348
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:41,800
game? What? What developer made this game? Because and what else did they do? Me. Let me spend some

349
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:47,939
currency first. It's really hard to implement. Well, they did a phenomenal fucking job.

350
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:57,130
Batman is locked. I want to play a game with Superman. How much does he cost?

351
01:34:57,689 --> 01:35:08,020
How do I unlock him? 2000 gold. All right. Yeah, sure. I want to try and match with Superman.

352
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:26,260
Stop swearing. My mom's getting mad at me. That's a mature audit. You had to click the

353
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:44,630
mature audience thing. All right. Let's play before the servers turn off. Let me just see how he is.

354
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:54,119
Wonder Woman seems pretty solid. Just a solid pick. All right. Let's see Superman. Superman has

355
01:35:54,119 --> 01:36:05,239
this punch. Big charge. That combo seems insane. And you finish it off with one of these.

356
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:22,569
One, two, one, two. Jesus. All right. Superman is very much a punch character.

357
01:36:23,739 --> 01:36:30,569
I actually really like characters like this. I like just bouncing. Okay. So what about your

358
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:42,649
specials? This is ice breath, right? Okay. What about side special? Holy shit. I can aim that too.

359
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:49,289
Okay. Superman seems pretty ridiculous. Is Superman insane? What's the tier list look like?

360
01:36:49,930 --> 01:37:01,819
All right. Down special. What's the application here? Oh, you just, okay. It's kind of like a

361
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:17,260
defense. Up special is big fly. Can you fly as Superman? No. You can fly as Superman.

362
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:39,850
So you have to be in the air. Wow. Holy shit. All right. Superman seems pretty fucking cracked,

363
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:55,689
if I'm honest. Let's go. Is he not? They nerfed him? Do they even have time to nerf any of these

364
01:37:55,689 --> 01:38:11,930
characters? The game has been in early closed alpha for like five days. Choose your character.

365
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:29,270
There was already a closed network test. Oh, okay. I'll do my best. I'll try it. How can

366
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:37,930
be staring into our souls? I'm reading the chat room. He looks off. Maybe you think it's because

367
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:43,130
of this? Do you think it has anything to do with whatever this is right now? Do you think it has

368
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:47,880
anything to do with how off I look today? I wonder if you think it has anything to do with this.

369
01:38:52,359 --> 01:39:02,439
They mean Superman, right? That's what I was saying too. That's what I was saying too.

370
01:39:02,439 --> 01:40:00,170
All right. Superman time. I feel like with a little practice, I would really like Superman.

371
01:40:41,460 --> 01:41:56,869
He kind of lumbers around, but he's really powerful. Oh shit. I keep getting caught.

372
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:32,810
That's probably it. Whoa. What the fuck was that? Get him. Jesus. He's a little slow,

373
01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:46,090
but I like the power. I like the move set. It's pretty good. This is a man-sized character. I

374
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:50,649
only got 10 minutes. Okay. Well, should I play it? All right. Viewer's choice. Who do you want me

375
01:42:50,649 --> 01:43:00,380
to play with? Superman has a triple jump? Viewer's choice. What do you think? Shaggy?

376
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:18,659
I haven't played with Shaggy. You're right. Okay. Shaggy. I played a lot with bugs already.

377
01:43:21,989 --> 01:43:25,750
I did one. I played the first two matches with Shaggy, but I had kind of no idea what the hell

378
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:34,869
was going on. All right. He's got a combo. What are his moves are doing here? He has this super

379
01:43:34,869 --> 01:44:06,039
Saiyan mode. Interesting. Okay. He goes ultra instinct. I have to move this light. Oh, that's

380
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:09,640
our Harley Quinn's in the game. Does that mean the Joker will be in the game eventually? I feel like

381
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:15,050
all the Batman characters will be eventually. They have quite a roster they can fill out if

382
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:57,420
they really want to. I would love to see Daffy Duck. I don't know where he is. Oh, I got it.

383
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:53,939
Can I eat this? What can I do with this? What do I do with this sandwich? Oh, I got it. Oh shit.

384
01:45:54,020 --> 01:46:01,659
Oh my God. I keep trying to just flatten them. What? He went through the fucking thing.

385
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:44,069
Oh my fucking God. Knock him off. I don't like Shaggy. What the fuck? Why can he go through that?

386
01:46:44,069 --> 01:46:50,539
That's so weird. This motherfucker can go through the whole stage.

387
01:46:51,260 --> 01:47:09,140
Holy shit. Shaggy. You're the fucking worst character in the game.

388
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:56,859
Okay. He's fucking terrible. Shaggy fucking. Oh, Shaggy. Look at Shaggy.

389
01:47:59,079 --> 01:48:15,340
Holy. Shaggy is the worst character in the game. Actual skill issue. Shaggy's S tier. Not for me.

390
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:26,840
Not for me. Quick. I got to do one more with bugs. Before Craftman blames his tools,

391
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,920
Shaggy just like smokes weed and fucking sits in a chair and screams at ghosts.

392
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:42,380
He doesn't have any superpowers. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower.

393
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:45,680
Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower. Superpower.

394
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:50,460
Superpower, guy that eats food. He's terrible. Never playing with him ever again.

395
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:12,579
What about Velma? Velma has like 180 IQ. Super powered intellect. Oh, I like that.

396
01:49:19,239 --> 01:49:43,909
Batman. Batman is the superpower of money. What about Harley Quinn? Harley Quinn is the superpower

397
01:49:43,909 --> 01:51:29,340
of new york accent what the fuck is that thing all right that's a good one to go out on it's

398
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:40,659
literally 459 right now i think the servers are turning off literally right now one more do you

399
01:51:40,659 --> 01:51:49,850
think i can get in one more i wonder if it actually is like strictly at 5 p.m let's see what happens

400
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:58,380
let's do one more fun one of a character i didn't really play with even if i lose i want to play oh

401
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:19,289
oh shit damn it oh well that was a lot of fun right hey they said five o'clock they meant five

403
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:48,819
i i was pretty pessimistic going into this i saw the trailer i said oh that's kind of interesting

404
01:52:48,819 --> 01:52:53,539
because people have done this before other companies and other studios with a bunch of

405
01:52:53,539 --> 01:53:05,449
characters have done this before i'm gonna i want to play this this is good this is really good i

406
01:53:05,449 --> 01:53:10,489
would not tell you i would not bullshit you on that this is good that was even like i don't know

407
01:53:10,489 --> 01:53:16,979
about the how balanced it could be eventually whatever right but that was a lot of fucking fun

408
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:22,359
open beta is in july i will absolutely be playing this again without a doubt what are we going to

409
