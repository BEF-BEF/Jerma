1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:14,619
Hey, what's going on everybody? How are you? What's the deal? Cool. Alright, we've covered that.

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's uh, let's go over what we're doing today. Today we're gonna be doing uh, you know what's

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:27,800
weird? This is the first time I've talked in my clean office. I don't like it. It's echoey.

4
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:37,299
Usually there's a bunch of trash on the ground. The trash and CD cases and old video game consoles

5
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:43,509
that took up a majority of the floor and the closet have been sorted. They've been put away.

6
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:57,619
Now I can hear myself. I don't like this. Show us the clean office. Nah, make it messy again. No,

7
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:08,500
I have those, I have a bunch of those bass traps in the corners. I've got the foam all over the

8
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,739
place. My whole wall in front of me is all that audio foam over here. Am I right? I got it all

9
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:21,959
over the place. Don't matter. It's like I, you know, like anybody that streams on Twitch,

10
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,000
they're really looking for the grandma house. You know, when you go into grandmother's house

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,040
and there's just stuff everywhere, you know, houses full of things. So the audio quality

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:43,189
is incredible in a fucking old grandma house. You can hear your grandmother on the phone loud

13
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:50,170
and clear with no echo. It's because she has six bureaus in that room and her carpet is,

14
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:57,459
it's like two and a half inches thick, long strands. And there's probably six or seven

15
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:08,469
coats of wallpaper on the wall. I want that house. I need that house. But that house is like,

16
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:15,939
nobody wants to live there. But anyways, hi, how are you? We're going to finish Dead Rising 2,

17
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:25,189
off the record. Should be fairly simple. I know how it is with me. We're always very simple.

18
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:35,349
It's not going to be. Don't worry. I think there's only about three to four hours left of this game.

19
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:53,930
We'll see. But this will be the final Dead Rising oriented stream for a while. No, ever. No, not

20
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:02,819
ever. I'm going to play Dead Rising 3 eventually, probably like another month or two. I don't really

21
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,620
want to play that right now because I've played it before and I don't remember it was all right.

22
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:14,840
It was fun. I guess it wasn't like these though. But this is the last Dead Rising stream

23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,530
that you're going to get for a while. So let's hop right into it. Those of you that weren't here

24
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:29,699
before and those of you that have never been here before. Hey, appreciate the follow. I want to look

25
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:43,180
at this first though. Did I get anything new? I have a shit load of time for 8-2. That's where

26
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:53,699
we are. Where the hell is this guy even on the cases? He's here. So we've got a huge amount of

27
00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:02,789
time and a day for 8-2, then 8-3, and then the facts, and then overtime. Zombie mutating gas

28
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:08,599
seems to be coming from the underground. I've got to find the source. But take a look. I've got a

29
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:17,350
lot. We're not going to let this get to yellow. TK is also infected. That's the only two things

30
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:25,269
I have right now though. TK needs Zombrex, although I'm not sure he deserves it. When do I need Zombrex?

31
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,180
I'm just gonna go buy one. All right, I'm gonna go buy like two Zombrexes from the store.

32
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:48,420
I got plenty of good items. You still have 21 Connect games to play. Don't think we forgot.

33
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:04,790
There's not that many, I can assure you. There's probably seven or eight Connect games.

34
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,920
All right, why is this so loud for me? What's going on here? I have to turn this down.

35
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:27,379
Why is it so loud for me? Is it loud for you? No, it should be fine, right? Why is it so loud for me?

36
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:38,139
I don't know. All right, so what's this magazine? I'll write edge weapons. So these last a lot

37
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:46,019
longer break this fucking box. I've got a good, I don't have to do anything. This is great.

38
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:54,790
Just go buy Zombrex from the store and end it. Oh shit, I forgot they, I forgot they coughed.

39
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:05,509
I forgot about the coughing mechanism. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

40
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:18,089
He's already angry. No, I'm fine. I just turned it down to like 30%. Did my computer get louder

41
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:32,709
in two days, three days? What is going on? Did I get a Windows update? Increased your volume

42
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,069
permanently by like 200%. All right, watch out. These, this, every time I come in here,

43
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,389
these fucking idiots stroll up behind me and they cause a huge problem. I'm ready for them

44
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:57,189
and they're not going to come in this time. He's already mad. No, I'm not mad.

45
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:05,529
All right, they're not going to come in this time. All right, I'm going to buy Zombrex. I was going

46
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:11,430
to buy like three of them. How many of these do I need? Look at, I have tons of money. I was

47
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:24,660
going to buy another one. I have three now. All right, I'm done. Okay, so now I'm going to go to

48
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:39,480
the maintenance place. Big bits already. That was a pretty good lie. Give me the coin. Got the coin.

49
00:07:40,279 --> 00:08:00,100
So now I've got enough Zom, TK is infected. I have a long time for this. Save TK.

50
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:07,620
I mean, I'm just going to go do it, right? I should just go do this right now.

51
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:24,860
I need to do this. Well, I mean, I have the opportunity to, so why not just do it?

52
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:38,409
Play it on the map. That's why in Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5, even if I played the game for 200 hours,

53
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,009
it doesn't matter. I still need the GPS. Blame technology for that one, guys.

54
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:54,440
Blame like the invention. I was going to say the inventation. Like it's a different noun when

55
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,779
you're talking about something that was invented versus the invention of satellite tracking and GPS

56
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:19,850
systems. Inventation. That's like incantation. All right, let's make the defiler. Let's go.

57
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:32,179
Blame the incantations. It's always their fault. Did you mean innovation? Yes, innovation and

58
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:41,539
invention combined. Inventation. Just give me a minute. I'll be okay. All right, let's go save TK.

59
00:09:46,200 --> 00:10:01,669
Don't get up from your seats. Everything's going to be fine. Save TK. He's lying down on a bed

60
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:17,700
somewhere, right? Which bed is he in? The security room? Where even is this dude? Everybody's just

61
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:33,639
crying. Yeah. You wouldn't be crying right now? Where is he? Downstairs? Which storage room?

62
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:46,649
I know he's lying down on something. All right, maybe everybody crying is a little odd, right?

63
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,850
Maybe I would assume some people would be crying. But every single person is crying. You're right.

64
00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:03,100
It is a little odd. All right, pick a door. Where is TK? Somebody help me. Upstairs next to the

65
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:16,100
cafe. Thank you. They're waiting for me to get close. Then they start crying. All right, TK.

66
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:28,500
Don't make me regret this. This was $150,000.

67
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,659
Now the move right there is to not flinch and to look right in the eyes and say,

68
00:11:52,539 --> 00:12:03,340
is that supposed to hurt? Wait, what? I thought I just hit him with a box

69
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:23,980
because my head's too big. Just spit on my mask. I'm fine. All right, cool. So thanks, little man.

70
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,980
I was starting to feel real hungry. I knew you'd come through. You're welcome. The only reason I'm

71
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,990
doing this is so you can do the time, scumbag. No easy way out for you. I, whatever. All right,

72
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:57,529
this is it. The only lead. Let's go. Just one once. Man of my word. All right, let's do the only

73
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:07,720
lead. Now where is this? This is all the way in Atlantica Casino. Let's do it. Might as well

74
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,409
do some fun stuff. Yeah. Those of you guys that have played this game, is this a scenario where

75
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,330
I'm going to have a funny time or can I just go dick around and level up and go find stuff?

76
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,610
Do I, is this, is this one of those missions that takes 10 straight minutes to do?

77
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,659
You never have time. I know. It's pretty quick. All right. Well, I have a save point right at

78
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,899
that checkpoint. I got a checkpoint here. All right, let's just, let's just look around.

79
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:53,019
Then something might pop up. You never know. We're going for a coffee creamer.

80
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:01,690
Look, if this is the final Dead Rising 2 stream, I've, I've got to milk it. That's

81
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,610
someone that's going to run to the finish line. No, I got to milk this. This is the last time you're

82
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,649
going to see this ever. I will never play this game ever again. You are never going to see this

83
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:17,610
game on stream and video format ever again. So why not? Like check this out. Pretty good swing.

84
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:38,070
Okay. Okay. Good swing. Pretty good swing. What's this? Jello? Chili.

85
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:45,700
Uh, if this is one thing I would never eat, it'd be one of those. I'm not going to eat a cup of open

86
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:53,220
chili, even in a zombie apocalypse. I'd rather eat one of these people. Is that gross? That was a

87
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:03,240
little too gross, I think. Wasn't it? I'm not sure if it's untrue though. It, I don't think it, it

88
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:19,820
might not be untrue. True. Sneakers. Stupid. Well, we got you. I need to be in my final outfit though.

89
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,000
I, I really like this. I really like this outfit. I don't think I want to get rid of it.

90
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:41,340
I feel like this outfit's perfect. No shoes. I can't have no shoes. I already looked it up.

91
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:49,460
I looked it up. I went to Fextralife slash Dead Rising 2 off the record and I went to all

92
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:58,889
available shoes. It's not there. Wait, somebody said, wait, we, this is our opportunity. Let's

93
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:19,860
roll a seven. Three. Ooh, no, almost. This is real, right? There's a six. Give me one. Oh,

94
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,370
that's real. That's actually a real thing. Are you serious? Nice work, person that said that

95
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:38,070
four days ago. Should I go back to the casino? I got, what do I do? Should I just play casino

96
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:53,240
games for like four hours? Well, I'm going to be in the casino anyways. Oh, by the way,

97
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,399
if you're wondering what's going to happen either later today or tomorrow,

98
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:06,519
uh, we're going to be playing Katamari. I don't remember. It's Katamari adjective or Katamari

99
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,119
forever. Katamari. Beautiful Katamari. The one with 360. I don't know. I don't know the names.

100
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,039
It's not like Katamari one. Katamari two. Beautiful Katamari. There it is. All right.

101
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,029
Let me go this way. Queen. Let's replace Queen with Queen. I'm almost level 31.

102
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:37,420
Let's go upstairs. Forever is PS3. I also have the DLC for it. I heard it's a pretty short game.

103
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:49,559
So I got DLC. Uh, there's a cap though. No, I can't take this off. One piece pajama.

104
00:17:51,430 --> 00:18:01,849
Oh, it's this thing again. It's this. I've had this on for way too long though. Didn't I?

105
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:13,740
This is the thing I had on before. Goblin activate. I, you know, fucking let's go.

106
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:28,549
Let's go. Final Dead Rising 2 stream. Whatever. I'm getting in the car. Let's go. Let's fucking go.

107
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:36,569
Bro. Bro. I didn't say bro. Why does it want, what is it trying even to do? Um, find the source

108
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:56,740
to get in the only underground tunnels. I, oh, I can't bring my car. Have I been here? Machete

109
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:11,099
and machete and drill. Drillachete. Machete and I know I can make this.

110
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,680
Roman machete. But is that even worth taking? I don't think this thing's very good. Is this

111
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,380
thing very good? Flashlight and gems. Yeah, I've made that already. I mean, it is pretty good,

112
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,259
but then I run out of space. Just drink the coffee Kramer. Not like I'm going to need it.

113
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:38,359
Because I don't want to lose the katana. Katana's really good. How does this not, uh,

114
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:49,960
calcify, how does this not calcify as a blade weapon? Big bits. Huge. That's enormous bits.

115
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,619
That is the biggest bits like ever. Hold on. That was, how much was that?

116
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:07,690
12,000 bits from Freddy Dredd. There's not even a message here. It's just 12,000 bits

117
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:19,460
from Freddy. Freddy, thanks for the more than $100. 120 converted currency dollars.

118
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,839
Okay. There's people here. I didn't know. These guys are blue. Does that mean anything?

119
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,390
Yeah, there's no message. It's just a huge drop of money. Thanks, Freddy.

120
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:44,019
It's the blue team. I think I got good weapons. I actually, you know, I want to run these guys

121
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,539
over a thing. When's my last safe point? I don't know. I did. I need a safe point right here.

122
00:20:49,900 --> 00:21:02,900
They blew it up. I need a gun. If I'm going to be dealing with guns now,

123
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:19,660
do the make the wheelchair gun thing. Yeah, I really should do that. I'm just so indecisive.

124
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:31,799
That's too slow. I think it's coming up here. Hard hat and beer is an estus flask. How am I

125
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:43,339
supposed to get up there? How am I supposed to reliably kill these guys? I'm going for it.

126
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:54,250
Stop puffing. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Stop it. I think there's a gun in

127
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:03,180
here. No, I got a security uniform. Are they going to come in here? Oh, I got to get the big,

128
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:09,109
big guy is going to come up with this. This is where I get my gun. I'm going to just baseball

129
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:18,309
swing them in the face. Come on in. I'm just going to spin when he comes in the door,

130
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,279
kill them for me. So I don't have to do this. They'll get it. They'll come in.

131
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,650
Shoot them. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. All right. Now make your way in here. How did that miss?

132
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:48,299
They just have the door covered. How am I supposed to, are they going to come in?

133
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:59,480
There's a shotgun. Where's there a shotgun? Oh, that you mean that thing. All right. Okay.

134
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:33,269
That's what we like to call a double Q. Okay, I gotta go. Salt rifle and I'm going to replace

135
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:38,420
let's another assault rifle. It's going to be machine gun people. It's not worth it. You know

136
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:45,779
it. I know it. I'm not going to pretend like it's worth having that. Wait, coffee creamer.

137
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,480
No, it's just coffee. It's not worth taking. Make gun wheelchair. All right. Hold on.

138
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:00,619
Wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair, wheelchair. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. I'm getting it.

139
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:12,200
Um, oh no. Just, is it just one gun and wheelchair? Hurry, hurry up and do it.

140
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,359
It's not gun and wheelchair. What are you talking about? Wheelchair plus battery plus gun.

141
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait, it needs to be electric. This is a double combination. Oh fuck it is. Are you serious?

142
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:56,950
Let me see. Holy shit. Okay. Can I get in it?

143
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,109
All right. Why doesn't professor X just have this on his wheelchair?

144
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:30,789
Wouldn't this help a little? Like there's no reason to not have that attached, right? What's

145
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:43,430
the downside of having this as professor X? They're behind. How am I supposed to get behind

146
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:58,890
this sandbag? This is the stupidest thing. It's not even hitting them. Yeah, it was pretty cool.

147
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:16,470
All right. I don't want to waste it. I would like it if it went faster.

148
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:32,740
200% screen shake. Yeah, it actually kind of sucked. I'm going to wrap around this way.

149
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,430
Okay. That's a rocket launcher potential, but I can't get out.

150
00:26:38,710 --> 00:27:16,259
It's not even good. What am I supposed to do? Give me the other one. All right. That wheelchair

151
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:34,759
thing is not very good. Find the source of the gas? Found it. It has infinite ammo.

152
00:27:35,880 --> 00:28:03,779
So just hold, but the screen shake is a downside. This is a wheelchair gone. I sort of blend in.

153
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:13,690
I'm just the cartoon caricature version that you get at the theme park of the zombies.

154
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:28,599
The only thing that's missing is I need to be on a small bicycle,

155
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:40,359
riding a surfboard, or holding a huge lollipop. I'm pretty sure all those things are in this game

156
00:28:40,359 --> 00:29:10,980
too. So that works. Not like this. Why? Why do emotes? Emotes have just taken over our thoughts.

157
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:31,099
Seriously, when I think of something that's unnerving or kind of scary, I just see that

158
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:40,569
Pepe face, the monk ass that I just see it. I just, Oh, fuck. I don't even make that face.

159
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:59,049
I just think about somebody in chat writing that face. I didn't save the game. Like anytime I'm

160
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,410
in a scary scenario, if it's terrifying, I'm just like, Oh, somebody in chat just wrote monk ass.

161
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:10,089
Like I'm not scared. I'm just, somebody else is scared for me. All right. I gotta be careful.

162
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:17,500
Should I not have shot those? Is it, was that a bad idea? Did I, am I causing a problem?

163
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:39,640
Uh-oh. Wait, hard hat and beer, right? I'll take it for later. But first I need,

164
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:52,809
Oh, am I going to get over there? Onion rings quick. Done right there. Nice. Pick it up.

165
00:30:53,369 --> 00:31:15,240
Pick it up. Move. My, where's the gun? Put down the fucking keyboard. Put down the keyboard.

166
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,549
All right. You know, some games have like, Oh, if I pick this up, just automatically trash it.

167
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:30,569
Can I add keyboards to that list? Can I just auto just trash keyboards? I probably needed that.

168
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:41,019
Boxes. Let me just, what? This is like a laser blast frequency gun. I'll change that up for a

169
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:50,740
keyboard. What does this do? Another blast frequency gun. Which one's better? It's a lot

170
00:31:50,740 --> 00:32:10,549
of food here. The hard hat. I need to, should I WWF somebody? Okay. Gun. Uh, eat this. Just eat

171
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:19,000
something. I want full health. How many, what do I have for healing? Uh, it's all right. It's not

172
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:31,289
terrible. Hit somebody with a steel chair. I don't have enough room for it. Hold on. What's over this

173
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:57,900
way? No, don't want it. Make room. Yeah. Things are going just as predicted. Absorption of the

174
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:03,579
compound is at 80% of ideal. And maturation rates are 10 times normal. Yes. I changed.

175
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:13,940
Not supposed to be in here. Oh, it's Dave. It's Dave. I work here. I just thought it'd

176
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:31,460
be funny to come out on Halloween like this. Wait, kill them? Uh, what is this gun do?

177
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:56,299
It just makes them grow up. What a way to die. That was not fun.

178
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,349
Desktop. Clean up that desktop. I hate, that's an anxiety desktop.

179
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:32,250
Move those icons. Put some folders there. You're freaking me out. Taking the coffee. Oh, and by

180
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:43,510
the way? Well, I don't think this guy makes it Frank. You should have just let me borrow

181
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,030
your phone, boys. Somebody just brews a pot like 12 hours ago and it just sits on the heater.

182
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:58,820
Of course it sucks. Like I didn't like make that. There's no French press in here, Frank.

183
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:08,739
All right, here we go. The source of the gas is a paramilitary operation underneath the city.

184
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:21,420
The others need to hear about this. All right. So what we got? Full heel. I told you.

185
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,340
I'll take a queen. I'll take a full heel. Um, give me the, I'll replace this. What is that? Like a VR

186
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:47,269
military case defibrillator. Take a computer. Take a computer. Why am I taking a computer?

187
00:35:47,909 --> 00:36:00,230
Take a computer. A puke gun and the computer. All right. I'll try it. I have to carry it though.

188
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:13,050
No, take it with the amp. Amp. Puke gun and amplifier. Where's there an amp?

189
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:27,690
The guitar amp. Well, why am I taking this then? He doesn't see it. There's no amp in here. Where

190
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:38,250
do you see an amp? I gotta go. It's behind you. Stop reading chat. Yeah. Good idea. That's a

191
00:36:38,250 --> 00:37:00,780
fantastic solution. I thought that was an amp right there. Ooh, urgent. Yep. Do I answer? Why

192
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:25,030
am I not answering? Amp in here. Amp. Oh, is this what you guys want? Super BFG. Blast frequency

193
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:30,820
gun and amplifier. 15 shots. All right. I'm not going to use it. I'm going to hold onto it.

194
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:44,739
Guitar and guitar and flashlight. Wait, flashlight and computer. That's just a

195
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,699
that's just a zoomer jack-o-lantern. No. Um, I don't know.

196
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,420
You can't even make a jack-o-lantern. How many times do I have to talk about the

197
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,900
jack-o-lantern portion of that stream? I was covered in slime and had knives in my hands

198
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,420
and the whole ground was covered in slime. That's how you die. That's how you end up in

199
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,219
the hospital. I canned that portion of that stream. Uh-uh. The whole ground was covered

200
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:37,659
in a substance that if I take a quarter of a step to my right, I go and split backwards

201
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:51,849
and you want me to hold a knife while I do that. I don't understand. Does he just not know how to

202
00:38:51,929 --> 00:39:00,059
carve a pumpkin? Why won't he hold the knife in his hand that's covered in slime?

203
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:19,429
Oh, beer. Do I still have the hard hat? No. Sorry, guys. I don't have the hard hat.

204
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,579
This thing's actually pretty good against zombies. You shouldn't have gotten slime.

205
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:40,780
All right. Whatever you say. Am I carrying a magazine? Yeah, it's for sharp weapons.

206
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,500
15 shots in this thing. Do I even still have it? Yeah. I have to save the fucking game, guys.

207
00:39:54,550 --> 00:40:08,739
All right. Hard hat, which I replace. This thing's pretty much broken. What about the gun? Oh, but I

208
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:22,300
need it. I need this gun in case. Get rid of the edged weapons. The magazine. The queen. Let me

209
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,619
at least get a use out of this then. The wrench. No, let me get the... I'm gonna use this. I still

210
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:34,519
have the katana. Yeah, the katana is a good weapon. Sword is broken against the bosses. That's true.

211
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,349
You're wasting time. Fuck. They're right. No, they're right. They're right. No, they're right.

212
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:43,670
They're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. No, they're right. They're

213
00:40:43,670 --> 00:41:05,159
right. No, no, no, no, they're right. They're right. I just... I'm almost 31. All right. Just

214
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:14,010
give me a hard hat. I can't get rid of the gun. It's so good at range. It's just... It's so good.

215
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:27,210
Is there money? Suitcase. Wait, can I... Nothing in these? I guess not. Okay. Wait. Don't I have

216
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:53,320
keys? Is this the safety deposit box room? What if I have another keys? Any case.

217
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Does money even matter anymore though? Let's be honest. That's $150,000. That's pretty good.

218
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:26,090
All right. Ooh, you got a gun. Oh, shit. Get away from me. I just... Okay. Good. Salt rifle.

219
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,409
That's what I wanted. That's what I wanted. There's a queen there, but I don't care.

220
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:39,590
Use the super BFG. Not necessary. All right. Where am I going? Oh, I gotta go back. Like, hurry up.

221
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:58,780
Through the trail. Try it out. No. There's a safe point right here. I'm not off locked.

222
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:10,230
I've got time. Look, I got time. 8-2. We're gonna do the middle one. I got time. No, I actually do.

223
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:41,190
Get away from me. All right. I'll use it once. Oh my god. That's ridiculous.

224
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:57,340
Okay. All right. I gotta go. All this because I saved it. I should have just ran down the...

225
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:06,679
Kill me. Just kill me. I'm gonna restart right there. I got, I got, I got screwed over because

226
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:22,659
I saved the game and I turned around and there's 10 people behind me. There's no reason to take,

227
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:26,980
like, seven cheese slices of damage. There's no reason to do that. I have, like, full health.

228
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:34,019
See? Like, why would I do that? I don't even care about the katana. The thing's broken anyway.

229
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:57,139
Are you seriously gonna interrupt my attack with that, with the sneeze?

230
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:05,670
Use the BFG. I'm gonna use the BFG for the last helicopter that's in the game.

231
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:32,539
I'm gonna shoot the helicopter, like, five times and I win. Oh, don't stop the stun. Okay, it's

232
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:52,070
actually kind of fun. All right. No, I'll take it down to 10. I shouldn't really take that coffee,

233
00:45:52,070 --> 00:46:05,690
but I kind of don't want to stop. There's orange juice right here. Oh, that's nice. Let's move.

234
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:14,010
I'm almost there. It's a crotch weapon, crotch weapon, crotch weapon, boomerang.

235
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:25,260
You're really good at throwing the boomerang, friend. Okay, third time's the charm. Third

236
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:50,329
time's the charm. Let's go. Why are you side arming it? You should, uh, BFG. Hehehehe. L-U-L.

237
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,559
Wear the Shaun of the Dead shirt. No, I'm, this, this is not a licensed stream.

238
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:15,300
This is an unlicensed stream. Okay, save it again. This is the final thing, 8-3, and then we got the

239
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:24,730
last mission coming up. You're wearing a street fighter mask. Um, when did I ever say the word

240
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:33,619
street and then fighter next to each other? No, this is big green man face. Where are you

241
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:53,059
getting that idea from? Okay, I'm, is there alcohol? Get the beer hat? I know. There's

242
00:47:53,059 --> 00:48:23,239
gonna be alcoholic right here. It's the Zombrex company. They wanted to infect everybody so

243
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:30,949
then they could sell everybody Zombrex. It's a conspiracy.

244
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,619
Yeah, but if the world was all zombies then what the hell, what are you gonna do with money?

245
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:02,519
Burn it?

246
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,829
Oh, they're lining up for Zombrex. They're paying with like cash.

247
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:22,869
What the fuck was that? Did I do that?

248
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:45,449
Oh no, she grabbed my gun. The backstab.

249
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:14,059
No. Fake hair? Wait, did I just pull her whole scalp off? Is it wig?

250
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:46,010
Oh, obliterate. Okay, well that was a little... Stacey is with the Fentatrans. She's harvesting

251
00:50:46,010 --> 00:51:06,340
all the zombies and trying to kill me. Go right, right. The cutscene is way less emotional when

252
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,909
you're wearing the mask. All right, the facts. So I gotta wear the beer helmet. That's important.

253
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:19,530
Any whiskey in here? Wait, you could have been a great, you could have been a great kid.

254
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:28,300
We could have been great. I'm reading that wrong. You didn't deserve this,

255
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,199
Sullivan. I can't believe I didn't see through that bitch's lies.

256
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,099
Sicko, psycho, sicko. This is for the police, guys. Come on.

257
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:14,329
So that's the final boss? Where's TK? Oh, it's all right. I got the fucking BFG.

258
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:26,300
Is there whiskey in here? No, it's snacks. No whiskey? All right, whiskey is everywhere.

259
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:33,019
So I have to make that before a thousand people unsub this channel. So bear with me here for a

260
00:52:33,019 --> 00:53:00,039
minute, guys. It's beer. Okay, right. TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK, TK,

261
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:20,010
TK. Okay. Everybody saying TK. All right. Let's go see what's going on. TK, how are you?

262
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:40,519
It's the same conversation I had before. How long are some of your guys and noses at this point?

263
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,829
You guys tell any more fucking lies, your noses going through the monitor.

264
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:54,519
I'm surprised you can even make it through a doorway. Well, no, that's just straight on.

265
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:01,980
So you'd be fine. Don't turn though. You'll break in half. Jill Krung gets thanks for the

266
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:12,010
five community subs. No beer? All right. The facts. I'm just looking for the fact.

267
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:22,099
One beer is all I need. I'm going to go to the bar. There's usually a bar. Where's there a bar?

268
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:32,809
The closest bar. The drink bean. I mean, this is the drink bean, but they don't have beer here,

269
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:51,019
do they? You don't serve a beer at a coffee shop. No, Vegas does. Yeah, but that's different. All

270
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:57,579
right. Where's there just a bar or a beer? I know there's one like all the way down. Sports. What's

271
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:08,949
in the middle here? Something in the middle. The craps thing. Yeah, there might even be one over

272
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:27,989
here. I'll take another orange juice. Yes, I will. I love minestrone soup. That's pretty good. Yeah.

273
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:40,219
It's very, it's very good. I'm with you on that one. All right. Beer. Just coffee creamer. Oh my

274
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:50,920
goodness. Can I puke with the mask on? Oh, they have anti-puke shields. Wait, he has one. Why is

275
00:55:50,920 --> 00:56:14,820
it working on me? It's because I'm infected. Oh, that's what it is, huh? Weird. All right. I need

276
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:32,219
a beer. Beer. No beers in there? How's that possible? It's a craps table. Perfect opportunity.

277
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:54,329
Check it out. Nice. That felt good. All right. No more. Looking for a beer. Wait, see one?

278
00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:25,400
That's, is that a beer or is that ketchup? Damn it. It's ketchup. What about the security box stuff?

279
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:44,179
I feel like I missed a whole portion of this game. What's it called? Jump scare, jump space.

280
00:57:45,139 --> 00:58:17,239
Fortune city bank. Let's go. I don't think this is a car. I really don't. It does not operate like a

281
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:31,159
car. This thing floats. It's on air. That thing controls like an air hockey puck. What's going on?

282
00:58:31,800 --> 00:59:16,150
Bastards. The world has got to see this. Photo time. This is unbelievable.

283
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:23,219
Ah, the tree got in the way. No, it's not. It's a very bad photo actually.

284
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:38,170
But I think I still, I think I got it. Where am I going? This way. Save point. I don't want to get

285
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:43,670
too overzealous because I don't want to activate the final game. Frank needs Zombrex. Oh shit,

286
00:59:43,670 --> 01:00:05,179
I forgot I could take that. Watch out. It's a pod. Did I kill this? God damn it. I got a picture of

287
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:43,800
the pod. No, that's not what I want. All right, let's destroy this thing. Destroy it. Nice. What

288
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:58,099
did that do? Why am I playing with the controller? Because I prefer controllers. For third person

289
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:09,860
action games, I play GTA with a controller. Playing with a controller. I know it has terrible

290
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:16,179
analog aiming, but moving around and walking around is a lot better than WASD for third person

291
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:24,099
games. I just like it. I like the analog. There's WASD for subtle turns like what you just saw right

292
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:36,489
there. Son of a bitch. Mouse is only good for first person. It depends. It depends. Oh my god.

293
01:01:46,380 --> 01:02:02,820
Oh fuck, this is very bad. Where is he? Okay, so they're just everywhere. They're everywhere

294
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,500
and they're wearing like all gray, so they blend in with the background of the game.

295
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:42,599
You know what? No, it's not. There's not enough people to do this.

296
01:02:43,320 --> 01:03:04,139
Get the fuck away from me. Is there a reason for me to do this? Does anybody know?

297
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:27,900
Queen. I definitely don't want to get rid of that. Here, just back my machine gun.

298
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:42,730
Let me back my rifle. Let's go. Wait. Okay. Easy, easy, easy. All right, watch out for the military.

299
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:55,940
They're like right over here. Just hug the wall. BFG. Doesn't matter. Well, it takes just one guy.

300
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:33,880
There's a beast standing near you. That's it, right? Yep. Boom. All right. Any assault rifles?

301
01:04:37,510 --> 01:05:08,579
Have I screamed yet? Not yet. Blueberry Buffet. Let's go. Turn, please scream. Why do you guys

302
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:24,179
want me to scream? All right. Save points right ahead. I'm going to do that. I'm going to take...

303
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:29,880
Do I have room? There's a lot of food here. They can't get over here, so.

304
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:39,449
They can't get over here, right? I still need a beer. Did anybody see a beer?

305
01:05:40,010 --> 01:06:06,789
No, there's a large soda. No beer. Beer? When you don't want one, they're just never around.

306
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:22,179
But when you do want one, you can never find it. Money? Go to the bar? Well, let me go to the bank

307
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:30,300
first. Because I have all these security keys that I don't know where the hell they're for,

308
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,340
and it's the final, like the final portion of this whole game. Save it, please.

309
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:55,530
I remember this fight. Wow, look at all these memories we made in Dead Rising 2.

310
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:07,219
Too many to count. Let's do this one.

311
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:19,019
Yeah, remember we came in here? There's a boss that ran around in circles and stuff.

312
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:38,309
Beer in the trash. Does vodka count? No. Scrounging into the garbage cans with drinks.

313
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:47,929
Two bottles of vodka, for real? I don't even want it. I wanted to see it break. Go to the bar?

314
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:59,300
Yeah, I know, but if it's like here, I'm going to do it. Because I need a maintenance permit anyways.

315
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:24,630
Where the hell am I? Oh, this is the bank. No, it's not. Food. Coming soon. Music. Bagged. Sports.

316
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:34,199
Venice Touch. Where's the actual, is the bar right in the middle here? Space, jump space. Right here.

317
01:08:34,760 --> 01:09:03,289
I'll get it after this. The bank. So I'm in the bank. Security clearance accepted.

318
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:09,560
Look at all these boxes. Security box one. How much money was in there? $50,000?

319
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:32,170
Hold on, this is all this money? 329. No, why didn't I just come here? Locked. $900,000 in there.

320
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:52,600
Oh, $40,000. Thank god. $185,000, $10,000, $999,000. There's Zombrex in here. That's unbelievable.

321
01:09:55,779 --> 01:10:02,409
Okay, let's just, might as well open them all. I'm here. There's Zombrex in here, too.

322
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:12,859
Gems? I don't need, I don't want these. I have four Zombrex. Should I just take two?

323
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:33,430
What happens if I stick myself a Zombrex twice? Just gems. That's shitty. Well, that's an extra

324
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:50,439
almost $500,000 from the security boxes. You become immune. Well, buy the car again. That's

325
01:10:50,439 --> 01:11:01,460
not gonna do anything for me, though. Well, that was cool. Now let's go to the bar and then I'm

326
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:18,500
gonna go to the maintenance room and get, people will resubscribe. Imagine not buying the Hummer

327
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:35,670
and buying the sports car instead. Oh, mega lol. I don't know what that means. All right, there's a

328
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:45,779
beer. You ready? I'm gonna do it. Where's that maintenance room? It's like right here somewhere.

329
01:11:45,779 --> 01:12:16,579
Don't accidentally drink it. That kind of looks like fun. You can play these, too. Maybe I should

330
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:29,060
play these. Time you've been waiting for. Wait, closed door, closed door, closed door. I know,

331
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:58,710
I know. I got it. What a ricochet. What a ricochet. And beer. Here you go. Beer hat. So,

332
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:19,880
okay, cool. So who cares? It's kind of cool. Save the game. Straight ahead. I got my beer hat.

333
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:26,779
I got everything I need this way. Best healing in the game. Who cares? Is it the best healing

334
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:45,529
in the game? How often can I use it? It's going the wrong way. Don't ever use it. Oh shit, I have

335
01:13:45,529 --> 01:14:00,659
to finish this. I only got five hours until the whole game explodes. How do I get over here?

336
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:21,380
Can I not get in there? Fuck. I can't get into that save point from here? There's a tunnel. Oh,

337
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:35,689
okay, that way. Anything else over here? Orange juice. I'll take the orange juice. Just in case

338
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:51,000
I need it. Softlock Albertson. I have not gotten softlocked once and you know it. A softlock

339
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:56,890
would mean that I have to start the game over. I haven't had to start the game over yet.

340
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:18,310
I'm fine. All right, the facts. Let's move. This thing's really good for just clearing the path.

341
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:37,130
So just bang left. Something you never do. I've only been able to do this with this weapon for

342
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:44,140
the last like 20 minutes. And stopping and clearing a path is actually kind of hard because

343
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,500
you have to, if you have people with you, they just don't listen.

344
01:15:51,130 --> 01:16:09,819
You want to go through the window? What do you want me to do here, game? Softlock. I have to make

345
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:20,789
sure. Not yet. Come onto this. All right, this is it. Harvester. There's another harvester here.

346
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:43,800
Uh oh. Military. Goblin mask and battery. Not the best time to tell me all this.

347
01:16:45,560 --> 01:17:31,659
Wasted. Let's destroy this thing. That gun. Still good. I'm gonna have to use the BFG here.

348
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:36,949
Uh oh. Yeah. Okay. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just.

349
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:55,880
He's not a Freddy. He's the rope gun.

350
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:20,300
Give me that. Uh. Gun on you? It's not very much ammo.

351
01:18:31,829 --> 01:18:36,229
Warmoot, thanks for the 10 gifted subs. Thank you Warmoot. Sorry, I couldn't really look.

352
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:46,899
All right, we're gonna try the hat. Should I drink out of the hat? No, I still have an arch,

353
01:18:46,899 --> 01:19:10,859
too. I'm free of the slot. Flashlight. Box and nails. Uh. Box and nails and propane tank?

354
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:22,310
All right. It's a hazard. I have to. All right, I gotta use it.

355
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:35,220
Going this way. Uh. Wait, there's gems right there. This gem's right here. Hold on. Leave me alone.

356
01:19:49,939 --> 01:20:21,640
Stop coughing. You coughed so long. Light saber. I can't do anything with that. Laser sword and

357
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:29,579
blast gun. I know I'm probably getting one guide right now. That's all right. Let's move. I gotta

358
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:46,229
move. Facts, facts, facts, facts. I don't have any guns for this. Shit. Um. I'm just gonna avoid

359
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:55,449
them. I have to go that way. All right, see if I can do anything about this.

360
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:15,859
Fuck. Whoa! Holy shit, you just came out of nowhere. All right, that's actually the best

361
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:45,859
thing that could have happened. Fucking aiming. Guy with a gun. All right, we're good. Give me

362
01:21:45,859 --> 01:22:23,590
your gun. Why are you holding a serving tray? This old gun, right? Give me that. How many more

363
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:45,100
of these are there? I tried to aim at you. Okay, I got it when I need it. I'm gonna need it right

364
01:22:45,100 --> 01:23:11,640
over here. Here we go. I'm gonna line it up. Are they dead? Where's the military? These things?

365
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:39,180
I picked up an ice cream. Shit. Okay, I gotta. I want that gun back. All right, my crutch is

366
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:55,350
almost gone. Is this thing gone? It is. Go! I got one more shot in this thing. Make it work.

367
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:29,689
Did I pass one? Where the fuck did I go? All the way down here. Is that all I can get? Is there a drink

368
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:43,699
out of the helmet? It's probably out. No, I have to move. Okay, the thing is actually pretty good.

369
01:24:49,289 --> 01:24:58,920
Wait, picture! That's not a secret picture or something? How? Is there a save point? Is this

370
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:25,770
one straight ahead? Wait! All right, save point. Right in the middle. Hopefully I have enough time

371
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:52,090
to do this. Come on. Where are we? Day five. I would say this is the safe one. We'll do this one.

372
01:25:52,890 --> 01:26:29,659
I don't know. I have items right now. I have the beer hat. That's it. Wasted. Wasted. It's all right.

373
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:35,770
I have to get through this. There's some guns up here, definitely. Yeah, I think we can just

374
01:26:35,770 --> 01:27:03,159
solve like this. Give me the grenade! What happened? Was that a super queen? Was that like an ultra

375
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:23,819
queen? Did I throw the grenade? How? Get away from me. There's so many. I need that gun back.

376
01:27:24,140 --> 01:28:21,479
It's okay. Oh, fuck. No! No! Give me that queen! Okay, 45. Okay, there's still more to do here.

377
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:41,609
How the fuck is this possible? There's more of this shit? Oh, man. I need to get that boot over there.

378
01:28:42,649 --> 01:29:02,039
I got the assault rifle. What do you mean? A dope? What do you mean? A dope? Uh-oh. Oh, shit.

379
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:19,899
I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. I need to bring out the thing. No! The queen, quick. She's right

380
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:44,199
here. Gun. Defiler. Give me this other queen. How many are there? Uh-oh. Okay. This feels like I'm

381
01:29:44,199 --> 01:30:12,899
cheating. Who cares? I don't even know what I have for items. Oh, fuck. Okay. Don't puke. Don't puke.

382
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:34,250
Another fucking harvesting. Holy shit. That took a million years.

383
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:57,779
I'm so glad I did not dick around any longer than that. Well, here's your last harvester.

384
01:30:57,779 --> 01:31:12,380
Come and get me, you interfering bastard.

385
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:50,279
Uh, save the game record. And then I'm gonna go wheelchair. Let's go. What? Get this fucking

386
01:31:50,279 --> 01:32:06,090
thing out of the way. Get it out of the way. I want to save. Day five, four a.m. Day five,

387
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:13,579
twelve. All right. I'm gonna save over this one. No. That. I don't know. This one. This one.

388
01:32:35,239 --> 01:32:41,560
Sloppy ass fucking thing. Give me a break. That's just so unbelievable. Just drive it.

389
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:51,350
Oh, that's what I wanted to do. I want to pick up and push.

390
01:32:55,829 --> 01:33:02,470
Push the wheelchair. What are you stopping you? I'm so angry. Seriously.

391
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:12,060
Well, I just took like three fucking pieces of damage for no reason.

392
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:21,300
Place it down. Stand behind it. Circle. Are you in the right? I think you're in the right area.

393
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:47,350
Yeah. Okay. Now you can push it. What ride is she on? I don't know. I'm almost out of stuff to eat

394
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:51,109
and stuff to drink and stuff to consume. Is she on this ride?

395
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:10,069
All right. Just eat here for a second. There's always beer in the beer hat. Yeah, I know,

396
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:16,859
but I don't want to like be throwing up. Yes, I was about to eat the spoiled hot dog and then

397
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:30,380
I immediately came to the conclusion it was a bad idea. Let's go. Right here?

398
01:34:52,340 --> 01:35:02,300
Is she going to get into Metal Gear? Yeah. She's going to stand up in a giant.

399
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:38,680
Haven't you? You work for Fina Trans. So this is all for what? Money.

400
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:49,050
You're even more of an idiot than I thought. This is about saving lives. Saving lives. You

401
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:55,289
created a panic to drive up demand. You're missing the point, Frank. This is funny.

402
01:35:55,369 --> 01:36:11,640
We can't save your precious sombrex without for our country. TK losing the keys. He was

403
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:17,319
well paid for giving us access to the cages. His show was going down the tubes anyway,

404
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:26,140
which was obvious. He decided to get here. Oh, look at me. Look at me. Make it hard for us to

405
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:35,899
finish the job. So what? He dragged you into this? So why didn't he give you up? You think I'm stupid

406
01:36:35,899 --> 01:36:45,619
enough to deal with an asshole like that myself? But enough talk, Frank. I had a feeling you'd show

407
01:36:45,619 --> 01:36:52,069
up, so I prepared a little toy for you. I hope I don't have to do this from the very back of that

408
01:36:53,350 --> 01:37:10,090
last cutscene or whatever. I hope this is the checkpoint. All right. Let's go. Well,

409
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:28,659
um, good pick. I got a lightsaber. All right. So let me see. Should I shoot the arm?

410
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:53,590
Shoot the eye. Shoot the light. Shoot the eye. Climb anywhere? Maybe just lightsaber the arm?

411
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,579
Oh, well, you got to take off the armor first. All right. I get it.

412
01:38:02,489 --> 01:38:08,550
I don't get it, but it's okay. What do we do with the rockets?

413
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:24,699
I guess. That's definitely lightsaber. You got to get close and knock off the armor.

414
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:43,609
All right. Well, you guys are right. All right. Good. It's going to happen now.

415
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:56,710
I don't have any more. You said I had infinite drink. You guys lie to me. I don't have infinite

416
01:38:56,710 --> 01:39:26,810
drink. Let's get this off. Come on. Still throwing up. I don't have any more heals.

417
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:38,460
There's probably heals in like a box, right? There it is. All right. Box looking for heals

418
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:47,850
in a box. Great. There's a military crate right here. There's nothing in that. Oh fuck. Yeah,

419
01:39:47,850 --> 01:40:17,189
there is. Look at this. I don't want to pick up the stools. You still made it through. Get the

420
01:40:17,189 --> 01:40:58,300
fuck out of here. What's the queen going to do for me right now? Eat that. Oh shit. What's left to

421
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:32,939
destroy on your arm? I have no more food. There's nothing in there. There we go. Oh shit. Don't kill

422
01:41:32,939 --> 01:41:57,460
me. I'm about to run out of time too. Yeah. Okay. So we have to take out the. Where is this? Where's

423
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:10,380
this putting me? Why is this putting me all the way back here? The damn game has checkpoints

424
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:15,260
everywhere and you wouldn't put one before like the last boss. Why is it? Why is it back here?

425
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:32,630
All right. I'm going to keep the gun. The lightsaber is all right. Actually, this is not that bad.

426
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:40,939
All right. Shoot off stuff. That's actually, I'm not a terrible visitor. Here we go.

427
01:42:41,579 --> 01:42:55,449
I understand what happens now. We got to dodge, shoot. Actually, that actually sucks. That really

428
01:42:55,449 --> 01:43:13,909
sucks. The gun is absolutely pointless. Bring the stool. If the stool works better than the

429
01:43:13,909 --> 01:44:08,619
lightsaber, I'll be so angry. Do it. Do the angry thing. Bring it down again. Got greedy. Rockets.

430
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:20,170
All right. I'm going to stop reading chat because somebody just wrote Wubba lubba dub dub.

431
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:51,300
Like that's going to help. That's going to help. Thanks for the help. Swing it down.

432
01:44:52,699 --> 01:45:07,020
Rockets. What is phase two even going to be? It's kind of like injectors. So lightsaber's almost

433
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:18,630
broken. All I have is the defiler after this. Hopefully it can last. Uh oh. All right. Here we

434
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:37,560
go. Phase two. Now what? I don't know what that means. Okay. Uh, clap, clamp, clamp, and then

435
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:47,000
got it. And then, okay, that's how it goes. It goes clap, clamp, clamp, clamp. I'm so scared to go

436
01:45:47,960 --> 01:46:09,619
This thing is really fucking slow. Boxes now. Clamp, clamp, clamp, and then the middle.

437
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:24,039
Is this thing almost broken too? What? I'm going to have to kill it with a stool.

438
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:42,380
Clamp, clamp, in the middle. I hope I can kill this thing with a stool. What if I run out of objects?

439
01:46:48,840 --> 01:47:20,220
Okay. Dodge. Right in the middle. Clamp, clamp, clamp, middle. Take a picture. Got it. No.

440
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:35,979
Shit. I need a new weapon. What's this? I'm trying to take a photo. All right. Give me a stool. Give

441
01:47:35,979 --> 01:47:56,779
me a stool. Vodka and a stool. Okay. I'm fine. Here it is. It's already broken. Fuck. Is that

442
01:47:56,779 --> 01:48:16,140
not hurting you? Got it. Oh shit. Oh my God. Okay. I gotta slow down. I'm like panicking for no reason.

443
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:27,579
That doesn't hurt you. That doesn't hurt. That doesn't hurt. I just don't ever shoot the gun.

444
01:48:27,579 --> 01:48:39,340
Another stool. Knife. Stool. Get the fucking stool. Pick it up. I'm almost out of time. I'm

445
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:52,489
almost out of time. Time's about to be over. No. God damn it. I'm out of time. Do it. Do it. Do it.

446
01:48:52,489 --> 01:49:04,340
Do it. Don't. Just please plant down. I need to hit you like three more times. Go down into the

447
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:15,539
ground. Oh my fucking God. Go down into the ground so I can hit you. What is it doing? What's going

448
01:49:15,539 --> 01:49:42,760
on? It's the gun. It's not doing anything. The gun's not doing anything. No. I was literally

449
01:49:42,760 --> 01:50:09,239
shooting the weak part of the claw and it did no damage. I had an electric stick. The electric

450
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:35,460
stick only had... It was red. Did I... Is it gonna lose or what? Okay. Well, that's my ending

451
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:48,250
apparently. All right. There's no record of the shelter dwellers having made it out of the city.

452
01:50:48,329 --> 01:51:04,020
Sure. Reload. Reload it. Of course they give you two stools and a knife. Like there's nothing

453
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:10,899
else back there that could be put back there. No. Two stools and a knife. Why is there not

454
01:51:10,899 --> 01:51:15,859
a fucking like pipe or something? Why is this stool? Why would you put stools back there?

455
01:51:15,859 --> 01:51:40,680
I can't even skip this. I can't skip this.

456
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:59,859
Okay. Let's open it back up. Before I go in there, I'm gonna bring... I'm ditching every gun I have.

457
01:52:01,699 --> 01:52:07,260
I'm not bringing a single firearm into that fight. I'm gonna bring as many melee weapons as

458
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:14,810
possible. They just do so much more damage. He's gotta hit the hand.

459
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:26,760
The guns were... Yeah, but why would I bring six guns when they do like...

460
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:34,310
They don't do any damage. You see how much damage I was doing with the defiler? That thing was

461
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:47,180
taking like fucking 10% per swing, folks. Why wouldn't I just bring like a rake? All right.

462
01:52:47,180 --> 01:53:07,750
Which one is it? Okay. Give me a fucking rake. Give me... I want a rake? Check this shit out.

463
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:18,260
All right. Two by four and a knife. Two by four and a rake. Two by four and a battery.

464
01:53:18,819 --> 01:53:24,869
Two by four and a lawnmower. But I'm not gonna use that. Just bring the two by four.

465
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:36,149
Knife and... I have the lightsaber. I have the defiler. I have this knife. Rake? I think that'd

466
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:44,390
be all right. Battery and mask. Head and battery. How do I take the head off? I can't remove my head.

467
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:56,170
Rake and battery. Let's try rake and battery. All right. Let's do it.

468
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:05,479
All right. Now I'm gonna use this to get there. I'm gonna bring a two by four.

469
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:13,420
Just in case. All right. I'm ready. Let's get the hell out of here. I actually know I have

470
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:40,409
to walk with this. All right. Fine. Fuck it. Let's go. Rake. Get away from me.

471
01:54:41,289 --> 01:55:16,869
Ah. All right. Here we are. Same deal. Why are you dropping the rake? Why are you dropping the

472
01:55:16,869 --> 01:55:44,729
rake? Oh, I jumped and landed and somebody touched my foot. Whoops. Oh my god. It's gone?

473
01:55:44,729 --> 01:56:00,680
Like, why do you keep doing this to me? Why is he doing that? All right. It's over. Let's go.

474
01:56:10,039 --> 01:56:22,359
See? Why would I shoot a gun right now? Can you please get up? Leave me alone. Please. Thank you.

475
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:57,859
Look at this shit. Are you kidding me? Got it. Taking a broad picture of rake. Hey, we settle down.

476
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:27,239
Look at that. Already at phase two. Let's do it. Come on. Clap, clap. Middle. Clap, clap.

477
01:57:28,119 --> 01:57:38,949
Right there. See how good this is. So good. That's insane. I'm so glad I did not bring any

478
01:57:38,949 --> 01:57:57,930
guns. Right in the middle. Clap, clap. In the middle. No. Stop. What's this RNG dog doing?

479
01:58:21,159 --> 01:58:22,439
Oh my god. Do you hear what he just did?

480
01:58:32,619 --> 01:59:20,119
Do it. It's a gun. Quick. That gun was doing an insane. What do I do? What do I do?

481
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:27,100
I have to use a gun. How is this possible without a gun? Just slow down. She's gonna

482
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:39,189
bury her head into the ground. Now what? Activate the racket? What the fuck just happened? Why? Did

483
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:57,939
I activate missiles? Oh fuck. Fight Stacy. What? Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it.

484
01:59:59,979 --> 02:00:09,270
I have to get back up there. Okay. That was very fast. Just get up there. What? He's stupid.

485
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:22,460
Can I not activate this one? I can't jump over the arm. Wait. Just slow down. Give me the orange juice.

486
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:30,310
I'm running out of time. I have about like 12 minutes.

487
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:49,399
Okay. Fight Stacy. Let's go. Let's go. Please.

488
02:00:52,359 --> 02:01:11,140
Activate it. Okay. Here we go. It's a good thing she's an idiot. Oh god. Did I lock it?

489
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:20,420
I think it's locked. I can't do anything anymore. I think it's over.

490
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:29,449
Do I have to go to the other one? This is fucking outrageous, man.

491
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:52,260
Coming? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I have to halt. I have to stop. Pause the game. Pause the game.

492
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:58,100
Pause the game. Pause the game. I have to do this again. It's all right. The rake is

493
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:12,229
phase three. Oh my fucking god. The rake was perfect. Just use the rake and then you have

494
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:38,869
to jump from platform to platform and activate the fucking terminal. God damn it. I blame everybody

495
02:02:38,869 --> 02:02:45,829
that told me I'm to make the hack because I'm just drinking booze and it's fucking ruining

496
02:02:45,829 --> 02:02:55,859
everything. All right. Let's go. Rake. Fast. Nothing matters. I only need a rake. Rake and

497
02:02:55,859 --> 02:03:07,449
battery. Let's go. Save time. That's the only item that matters. Check it out. Watch this.

498
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:16,890
Save the game right now. Please get the beard trimmer out of the way. We're going to slot one.

499
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:24,060
Let's go. Why save? So I don't have to make this ever again.

500
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:49,380
Two fucking stun mechanics in games like these make me want to puke blood. Just reload. Just

501
02:03:49,380 --> 02:04:21,000
reload the goddamn game. This is unbelievable. I could drown myself back in this. There's a zombie

502
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,239
on top of me and I think I take more damage when a random person swipes at me running through the

503
02:04:25,239 --> 02:04:48,470
crowd. Why is it like this? Here comes a 45 minute sex scene. There are no sex scenes.

504
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:58,250
There's no shame in restarting with my current level. That would be a really good idea if

505
02:04:58,250 --> 02:05:11,560
I wasn't in the last like 12 minutes of the whole game. If I were to go to the very beginning now,

506
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:17,319
oh uh-oh. It wouldn't take that long to rush. No. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I

507
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:23,350
got another mechanic. Pretty clean run by the way. This is a good checkpoint. By the way,

508
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:29,109
if it looks like I'm going to lose, I'm just going to quit. Make another rake. I can only

509
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:37,659
hold one at a time. If I make a second rake, it's not going to work. I'm going to bypass pretzels.

510
02:05:37,659 --> 02:06:10,180
I don't need it. Here we go. Clean. For the part here. Good. Missed it. No, I don't need the

511
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:15,369
pretzel. I should not take damage in this first phase. Maybe the second one, but not this one.

512
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:39,319
That did so much damage that it hurt his hand and he pulled back. Good. Good. Good. I'll get a few

513
02:06:39,319 --> 02:06:55,539
photos. Don't worry. That bad. Give me that second phase. Give me that second phase.

514
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:27,140
Let's go. Nobody touch anything. Good RNG here. I need it. That's not good RNG. It's bad RNG.

515
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:45,180
That's also very bad RNG. 50% on the first swing. All right. The rake's almost done.

516
02:07:46,060 --> 02:08:02,340
It's a toss. Nice. Do it again. Bang, bang, bang.

517
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:15,260
Sorry. I'll get it on the next run. One more. All right. One more. And then, oh, good RNG.

518
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:34,869
All right. Let's go. Clean. This time, it's a QTE fight. Don't fuck it up.

519
02:08:40,359 --> 02:09:06,140
Got it. It's okay. I got it, right? QTE. Did I do it? Okay. Let's go. It hurts.

520
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:32,939
One more. What do I have for alcohol? No, orange juice. Just take it slow. Orange juice.

521
02:09:33,659 --> 02:09:58,970
Don't drink any booze. Don't aggro. Okay. Why can I not activate this? What happened?

522
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:33,260
All right. Back to one. Back to one. Back to one. Back to one. No soft lock for me.

523
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,939
I thought I was going to screw that up on that last one. I think that's kind of scary.

524
02:10:56,899 --> 02:11:04,100
It's like you're a little out of your league, boy.

525
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:24,420
It's Agent S. I'm ready for extraction. Yeah. I just have an old newspaper

526
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:27,060
that needs to be taken out to the trash.

527
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:43,909
That's such an anticlimactic way to die in a game like this. It's just like,

528
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:53,880
no, you're just instantly dead. Dead, dead, dead.

529
02:12:06,899 --> 02:12:16,380
Wait. What do you mean before the firebombing begins?

530
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:22,020
How many hours are left before the firebomb begins?

531
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:27,350
Okay. I thought I had to get to the roof again.

532
02:13:06,699 --> 02:13:47,369
Go get TK. Where is he? Wait, where where's she? Sturned to a zombie?

533
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:46,600
What did I just do? I skipped it. Yeah, but I didn't, I didn't think I was going to do that.

534
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:57,140
Did I skip the cutscene too? No, no, we're here.

535
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:31,609
She's alive.

536
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:56,579
Is this a dig at the first game having like a gigantic fetch question in the game?

537
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:13,380
Compromising photo. Oh man, look at all this shit. All right, it's pee time. I gotta get up a

538
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:18,920
stretch. I'm gonna pee. I'll be back in like two or three minutes. Stretch your legs. You'll be

539
02:16:18,920 --> 02:19:00,920
right back for overtime. So instead of doing overtime, I was probably, I was thinking about,

540
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:07,659
thinking of going back to the save where I lost Juan and just going from there. I felt kind of

541
02:19:07,659 --> 02:19:14,840
really bad about it. I missed core, during that little final boss there, core monster gave 20

542
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:23,180
community subs. Thank you for this huge sub drop core monster. I missed it, but just touch upon it

543
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:37,290
now. That's a lot of people. I have plenty of Zombrex, so that's good. You have to do a perfect

544
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:41,690
run. There's no way I'm doing that. All right, so let's go. Zombrex stat. I'm gonna go,

545
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:53,770
uh, start on the top right. Start over here at, uh, painkillers. Yeah, I'm gonna go all the way

546
02:19:53,770 --> 02:20:00,579
around. Oh, what's the one right next to me here? We'll go this way. Find the compromising photo.

547
02:20:01,299 --> 02:20:19,690
Let's do it. What? Okay, that was strange. That was very weird. So what does it look like now

548
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:35,299
outside? I'm so happy. Dead Rising 1. Overtime. True ending. Dead Rising 2. Overtime. True ending.

549
02:20:35,299 --> 02:21:01,430
No resets. Time? Yeah, I'm just, I'm going for it. Are they military everywhere like

550
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:07,559
that wasn't the first one? There's only one reason why I would be upset at this game,

551
02:21:07,559 --> 02:21:12,920
and it would be if it was just a cop, just a carbon copy of Dead Rising 1 when it was just

552
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:29,540
people's. Okay. It's not, I don't think it is. I can still gamble too. Maybe kind of compromising

553
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:35,500
photo. Where is it? Okay.

554
02:21:59,510 --> 02:22:06,280
Wait, what, what the hell was that? All right, let's go to Zombrex Stash. That's the next one,

555
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:17,379
right? Where is this one? Is it up? It's down. Okay. It's in the garage. Underground tunnels.

556
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:42,299
Check the photo. Yeah, I haven't looked at the photos in a long time. This one sucks. This one

557
02:22:42,299 --> 02:22:59,989
really sucks. Oh, right. That's one. I almost threw like a grenade at these two. Who's standing

558
02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:05,340
there? All right. I like that. Strange. Whose boobs are these? No, that's okay. That's the bum.

559
02:23:05,979 --> 02:23:12,760
I don't know why I took a photo of this. Half of these are just on accident.

560
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:34,340
I never got rid of the snipers either. Oh, that's important. This one, is this one saved? Wait,

561
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:55,590
I'm sharing these. I don't want to share them. I just want to lock them. This one sucks. This

562
02:23:55,590 --> 02:24:00,540
one sucks. Oh, that. I was trying to throw it at it and hit her in the head and right when I hit her,

563
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:06,629
take the picture. That one sucks. That would've, but it was a good one before when you got run

564
02:24:06,629 --> 02:24:19,530
over by the thing. These are just like, I need to get rid of them. Okay. The people hugging photos

565
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:35,590
just don't need to be saved. Okay, cool. Zombrich stash. He hates when people are in love.

566
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:44,620
There's no reason to have it. Do you guys really think that Disney World keeps all the photos of

567
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:50,299
you going down the crest of the roller coaster? No. The second that you don't want to buy it,

568
02:24:50,299 --> 02:25:05,620
they delete it. Am I not going the right way? What's happening here?

569
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:20,389
I am. I'm going the right way, right? Yeah, I gotta go underground. They sell the photos to the

570
02:25:20,389 --> 02:25:30,069
government. If you really think the government wants you going down Splash Mountain, I mean,

571
02:25:30,069 --> 02:25:41,420
I don't know what to tell you. Where are they storing all this stuff? So you're telling me

572
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:44,860
that the government has a photo of everybody when they've ever gone down Splash Mountain.

573
02:25:45,500 --> 02:26:02,620
What hard drive is this on? Just Disney photos alone is probably 7,000 to 10,000,

574
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:28,139
probably like 55,000 petabytes or something. It's on the cloud. Queen's here. Just give it to me.

575
02:26:28,139 --> 02:26:33,819
Give it to me. Yes. Oh, man. Oh, man. That's how you get somebody upset.

576
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:39,819
That's how you get somebody really upset. This is what just happened right there.

577
02:26:40,459 --> 02:27:02,469
Look at that car. And imagine being the government employee that goes through those.

578
02:27:04,629 --> 02:27:12,600
That would be the most boring fucking job ever. It's just going over hundreds of millions

579
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:18,280
of going down the Splash Mountain photo. For what? What are you storing them for?

580
02:27:21,739 --> 02:27:44,979
What would you have to have that for? For face recognition. I mean, it's fun for the police.

581
02:27:44,979 --> 02:27:56,579
Wait, what? We're going to get the staff. I grabbed again. I swear I need to heal now, too.

582
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:34,379
Oh, it's in the train. I can't just climb this. I know I'm going to puke. That's good.

583
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:39,659
I kind of don't need this magazine anymore. It's useless to me.

584
02:28:40,299 --> 02:28:43,500
I dropped the helmet. Yeah, because I puked and I don't want it anymore.

585
02:29:02,969 --> 02:29:12,500
Trans left a nice little gift basket. What do you guys think your CIA profile looks like in the

586
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:19,750
photo regard? Do you really think there really just is like 600,000 photos of you? Imagine getting

587
02:29:19,750 --> 02:29:27,459
that like on the drive. They're just like here. Here's every photo. It's just you walking down

588
02:29:27,459 --> 02:29:39,340
some street. Cut his mic. No, keep my mic on. Where do I need to go? I need a car or something.

589
02:29:39,819 --> 02:30:09,209
Car, motorcycle. Grab me right now. You guys just extra grabby. Oh, for the love of God,

590
02:30:09,209 --> 02:30:14,409
just kill them. They're not going to stop. They're never going to stop. So why not just get rid of

591
02:30:14,409 --> 02:30:58,459
them? I hate it. He hates it. He does. He does hate it. I got it. Don't worry. Okay. I'm just

592
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:46,329
making sure I'm going the right way. Did GPS freak the fuck out? I got it. Oh yeah. I'm ready. And

593
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:56,920
amplifier and gun. Amplifier and flashlight. Amplifier and defiler. Amplifier and beer.

594
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:16,340
Amplifier and this thing. Nope. I don't have the BFG. No, I don't. Sad. Motor oil. I never

595
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:28,549
use this for anything. What should I do with this? Drink it. You can't drink motor oil.

596
02:32:31,290 --> 02:32:46,940
You should check the combo page in all caps. There's a lot of info here. Money. What else

597
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:55,190
can I do with the computer? I don't see motor oil anywhere. There's no motor oil on this list.

598
02:32:55,829 --> 02:33:16,680
So the person that screamed at me, I'm going to scream back. Spray paint and knife. Eh,

599
02:33:17,319 --> 02:33:36,870
another handgun. All right. I'm going to waste one of these. Handgun and spray paint.

600
02:33:49,819 --> 02:33:58,059
Pipe and what am I looking for now? Right here. All right. Expensive champagne.

601
02:34:32,629 --> 02:35:11,670
Turn off the face cam. I don't have one on. Wait. Orange juice and beer. Nectar. Orange juice,

602
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:16,899
orange juice. No. Is that a waste? I feel like I want these orange juice. No, whatever.

603
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:29,049
I need this spray paint. Just cover yourself in paint.

604
02:35:40,309 --> 02:35:51,379
Beard. Double beard. I can't fucking believe my just drank that. I was trying to punch you.

605
02:35:52,659 --> 02:35:56,340
Flip it. I want you to clip that. Clip that because it was nothing in my tray.

606
02:35:56,340 --> 02:36:00,260
Flip it. Go look at it. Go look at it. I want to punch this guy. There was nothing in the image

607
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:25,510
right. Go clip it. I want you to look at it. I can't put a coin in there. All right. Get me out of

608
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:34,870
this. Wait. There's a beer. Beer and vodka. Let's do it. Nectar and queen. I can't put

609
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:45,180
queen in there. Nectar and queen. Wait. Let me flush this out. Let me flush this out first.

610
02:36:54,379 --> 02:37:02,360
Okay. So that's randomizer. All right. Nectar and queen. If I do this and it's wrong,

611
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:08,329
I'm not going to scream for two months. Okay. Are you sure you want me to do this still?

612
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:21,690
Good. You can't. You can't even put the queen in there. See. In two months.

613
02:37:23,209 --> 02:37:29,639
Look at all these fucking handguns. All right. I don't even need this anymore.

614
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:48,420
I've been holding on to it for no reason. Sounds like a shotgun though. I have to redo this.

615
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:55,129
Stupid idiot meat on bone. Stupid idiot meat on bone. Meat on bone. Meat on bone. Meat on bone.

616
02:37:55,850 --> 02:38:13,780
Stupid idiot meat on bone. Stupid idiot meat on bone. I'm just trying. Oh, there's the expensive

617
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:36,739
one. Okay. Should I do one more? Yeah. I'm going to do one more time and I'm going to replace

618
02:38:37,860 --> 02:39:01,829
the queen. Queen and nectar at work bench. All right. I'll do queen and nectar at the work

619
02:39:01,829 --> 02:39:06,069
bench. If it's not real, I'm not going to scream for like six years. I'm just going to come back

620
02:39:06,069 --> 02:39:19,979
when I'm like 45. Be like, remember me? I really got you right chat. Okay. Give me that clean back.

621
02:39:19,979 --> 02:39:27,020
I'm going to replace the, this thing's pretty much toast anyways. So fuck it. Give me the queen.

622
02:39:28,059 --> 02:39:44,819
Let's go workshop. There's a bunch on the way, but wait, this tube right in front of me.

623
02:39:45,459 --> 02:39:51,399
Let's go get, okay. We got, that's going to be last. Let's go get,

624
02:39:52,709 --> 02:39:55,670
let's go get men's silk thong and then come back and do the other ones.

625
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:03,979
And anybody that like disagrees with what I'm saying is getting a timeout.

626
02:40:11,819 --> 02:40:19,100
If I swing and miss and I don't hit a zombie and you say, like you swung and missed LOL,

627
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:46,940
timeout. I can't talk. This thing's pretty much done. Let's do a grenade. Fine. Yeah, sure. Boom.

628
02:40:49,209 --> 02:40:58,180
I didn't get a chance to see it. Let's go.

629
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:14,100
Did you guys watch the stream? If I was constantly like this, like this, ready? Like,

630
02:41:16,090 --> 02:41:21,500
no, no, no, shut the fuck up. Let's just shut the fuck up. The next person that says anything

631
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:45,479
like that. I'm going to go guys. Shut up guys. Stop, stop, stop. I swear to God, I hate you guys.

632
02:41:45,559 --> 02:41:59,700
What if I was like that? Are people like that? Yeah. Well now you have forever.

633
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:16,569
Anytime I get frustrated in the game or I get mad about something, I never want to get like actually

634
02:42:17,690 --> 02:42:24,260
like, the stream is ruined to angry. You know what I mean? Cause there's a certain line where

635
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:41,420
you just are so upset that like the stream is ruined and your day is ruined. Mario tennis.

636
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:50,920
Oh, it's upstairs. Yeah. I think I've allowed one in five years of streaming.

637
02:42:52,219 --> 02:42:55,340
I'm not allowed one stream where I'm like fucking stupid, fucking games,

638
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:59,899
fucking stupid, dumb fucking idiot. Fucking game is stupid. I'm not allowed one of those.

639
02:43:12,889 --> 02:43:18,229
Ooh, you didn't use it. No, I didn't.

640
02:43:18,229 --> 02:43:32,469
All right. So that gives us that. Let's move. Uh, what's faster? What do you think?

641
02:43:36,219 --> 02:43:39,579
These two last. Yeah. We'll go down to the uh, sutures.

642
02:43:41,739 --> 02:43:47,420
Change mask, please. Fucking not change my fucking mask. Fucking stupid fucking thing.

643
02:43:47,579 --> 02:44:06,059
He's not even trying to string together a sentence. Just saying, just being angry and saying swears.

644
02:44:06,059 --> 02:44:11,899
Come on over the top. I can't throw him over the top rope. What we got here? Randomizer.

645
02:44:11,899 --> 02:44:28,649
Let's see what it does. What does it do? Nothing. Just pew. Nothing. Stupid. Fucking dumb.

646
02:44:37,989 --> 02:44:47,100
We've talked about it a million times before, but there's always a way you can tell when somebody's

647
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:54,059
really mad. Instead of talking like this, they drop the voice down like this and they talk kind

648
02:44:54,059 --> 02:44:58,870
of fast and they just fucking say like this is fucking stupid. I'm not even, this is like seriously

649
02:44:58,870 --> 02:45:04,389
fucking dumb. You drop down to like normal I'm talking on the phone voice with like,

650
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:15,239
no, you wouldn't be like that mad. Who are you that mad at? You're like really, really angry with

651
02:45:15,239 --> 02:45:33,639
somebody on the phone. What is this? Spin the wheel. Should I do the wheel? Spin the wheel.

652
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:48,659
A thousand bucks. It's $25,000 to spin this again. Oh my goodness. I keep talking over and over and

653
02:45:48,659 --> 02:46:03,719
over again. Let's spin the wheel and see what's going on with all my money. I'm not sure that's

654
02:46:03,719 --> 02:46:23,159
gonna happen. Yikes. Is this one super defense? The queen. No, no, no. If I use the queen, so

655
02:46:23,159 --> 02:46:26,840
when people are gonna write stupid fucking dumb fucking idiot, I'm telling you, I'm not supposed

656
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:43,879
to do it. I lost. I lose again. How do you win? I wish I could just play this. You know, I really

657
02:46:43,879 --> 02:46:49,639
wish I could just play this. Instead of being cough, stun locked. I wish I could just play that.

658
02:46:53,510 --> 02:47:14,180
I need a weapon. Something that's not a serving tray. This should be a fucking internal clock

659
02:47:14,180 --> 02:47:25,340
that like you can't talk more than once every 20 seconds. Do you upset me? I don't know. I'm

660
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:40,700
just going. This is ridiculous. Look at how long that lasts. It's a full five seconds.

661
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:52,420
Fucking dumb fuck. Fucking, fucking thin. I'm using a toy and it's almost broken.

662
02:47:54,920 --> 02:48:13,100
It comes with throw up. Don't do it. Can I have them? Just go over here and go in the maintenance

663
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:36,729
room. Okay guys, see you in three months. Nope, I get a stream. Wingman. Wicked. What does it do?

664
02:48:37,530 --> 02:49:00,420
Where is it? Is it the first one? Unleash this ruthless wasp against the zombie menace.

665
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:17,420
So it's just a, why is this in here? An oil? What does this do? Sword, training sword and oil.

666
02:49:18,059 --> 02:49:30,520
Ready to rumble. Well, that's awesome. I'm going to hold on to that. Brum and is there a machete

667
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:45,290
you're on? Brummin something else. Maybe. I just drank the thing. I need a good, thank God. There's

668
02:49:45,290 --> 02:49:56,500
one right here. This is a good one. I already have one of these. I have two. I'm not even using them.

669
02:49:59,959 --> 02:50:10,120
Zombrex. Almost didn't do it. Oh my God. That would have been so funny. All right. It's gonna be a brum.

670
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:23,930
Get it out. Then we go all the way out and around. Is there a safe point in here? No,

671
02:50:23,930 --> 02:50:38,809
it's out this way. Okay. I have a weapon. Y'all better run. Think of the funny drama that I find

672
02:50:38,809 --> 02:51:09,559
moment. There's a rocket launcher. What? Where's there a rocket launcher? Liar. Where? Oh, no lies

673
02:51:09,559 --> 02:51:21,989
here. Not a liar. It's a good trait. I'm gonna take the sword too. And I'm getting rid of the hat.

674
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:37,340
Take a sip and then get rid of it. No, I want to throw it. Okay. Give me my, I've got my sword. I've

675
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:52,229
got my rocket launcher. Let's move. 100 in here. This game is sick. Seriously, this game is sick.

676
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:59,479
Would you guys still stay here and watch it? I, all right, let's find out. I'm curious.

677
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:15,579
Game's fucking sick.

678
02:53:05,350 --> 02:53:41,260
I was gonna say, somebody said in the chat, I was gonna go, y'all, this is dope. That's it.

679
02:53:49,620 --> 02:53:57,139
All right, we need gauze. Save it. Do a rocket jump? No, that'd be cool if we could.

680
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:17,819
Dynamite. Not bad. Not bad.

681
02:54:48,329 --> 02:55:03,049
Am I stuck in here? I just look over and I see that now. I can't get out of this. I really can't

682
02:55:03,049 --> 02:55:29,129
leave with this. Can I throw it? Nope. Throw backwards like this. Throw it. Why won't he throw

683
02:55:29,129 --> 02:56:00,620
it now? It's getting fucking dope. Come on. Is that close enough? That guy. All right. I'm

684
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:21,719
getting real sick of this thing. Give it to me. Why can't, okay. Sick. That's annoying. That's

685
02:56:21,719 --> 02:56:30,600
annoying. Why can't I get this out of here? Sorry, I went down into the waterfall thing.

686
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:54,809
Didn't mean to. I do want this gun. If I don't. I jumped into that guy's arm. That's how you know

687
02:56:54,809 --> 02:57:00,409
it stinks like a turd. When I jump into the guy's hands. Like he was waiting for me to jump.

688
02:57:01,530 --> 02:57:28,260
All right, they both right over here. I'm gonna go read a book. This is too sick.

689
02:57:29,379 --> 02:57:35,659
I hope the book is good. What is the book? You can't leave without saying the book. Title.

690
02:57:36,379 --> 02:58:03,379
Plus the title. Let's go. Flashlight in case I find gems.

691
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:29,270
Save this guy. What was the point of saving this person? I could have given that Zombricks to the

692
02:58:29,270 --> 02:58:48,739
whole lady. Not very big brained of you. What books do I read? I like to have a certain amount

693
02:58:48,739 --> 02:58:58,659
in my possession at all times. Sunday morning cartoon pages. The Bazooka Joe bubblegum.

694
02:59:03,059 --> 02:59:13,979
The back of the glade when I'm taking a shit. What else do we got?

695
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:37,989
Anything that has ingredients in it? The newspaper. If the newspaper was still

696
02:59:37,989 --> 02:59:47,370
cold I would get it and read it on the toilet. This is not. I don't like the way a newspaper feels.

697
02:59:49,879 --> 02:59:53,639
When you pick up a newspaper and you touch it and you it's like a sandy weird

698
02:59:54,840 --> 03:00:07,620
awful feeling on your hands. I hate it. You can almost feel the ink kind of coming off. It's

699
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:11,459
uh I really don't like it. It's a weird thing that I don't like.

700
03:00:13,139 --> 03:00:18,569
Yes I also don't like the sound of tape being pulled and I don't like popping balloons.

701
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:36,600
Hey you found a real weird one. Return to the arena.

702
03:00:39,959 --> 03:01:00,920
Now let's try this again. Just was not meant to be. Ever. Where did my sword go? The cool one.

703
03:01:11,659 --> 03:01:18,379
He swung and you missed. It's all right. Boomerang plus knight makes a boomerang knight.

704
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:44,680
I got it. That guy's dead. Boomerang knight. Uh can I get a couple uh can I get a couple of

705
03:01:44,680 --> 03:02:03,780
hyucks in the chat please for the boomerang knife that somebody just said? I don't want to break it.

706
03:02:03,780 --> 03:02:25,319
Last opportunity I'm gonna get to do the 25th of 10 000. Can I do it again? Let's see if I can do

707
03:02:25,319 --> 03:02:53,639
it. 25 grand. Now I did it. Didn't I have a weapon? Oh that guy got faced. That guy was not even

708
03:02:53,639 --> 03:02:56,600
paying attention. He was looking at his fingernails and he's still instagramming.

709
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:22,309
Instagram? Is that what I said? I did not say Instagram. Don't forget to save.

710
03:03:24,149 --> 03:03:47,930
That person just saved the whole stream. Seriously. If you don't think so look it up. I go on the

711
03:03:47,930 --> 03:04:05,340
wrong one every time. No German. No no no no. Let me know. 5 20 12 52 2 a.m. This one right here.

712
03:04:07,020 --> 03:04:27,610
Turn on your face cam. You don't need a face cam. It's not necessary. Give us content. It's not

713
03:04:27,610 --> 03:04:38,389
necessary. I need a face cam and like oh and like it'll be called face cam fridays. Remember that

714
03:04:38,389 --> 03:04:47,579
was a big deal. I used to have a series on youtube called face cam fortress because that was a big

715
03:04:47,579 --> 03:04:56,020
deal to have your face cam turned on during the game. I know a lot of you are laughing right now.

716
03:04:56,020 --> 03:05:18,020
This was like 2011. 2012. That was a big deal back in 2011. Wait wow you can actually do that.

717
03:05:18,579 --> 03:05:26,659
Pretty sick. Arena time.

718
03:05:50,809 --> 03:06:00,659
Where's Darth Vader? I can't even say it. Where's Darth Vader?

719
03:06:03,940 --> 03:06:04,659
Start what?

720
03:06:33,639 --> 03:06:38,920
I just came to the stream and I don't understand this like my weapon writing number is minus two

721
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:41,799
plus two. Like I don't fucking get this stupid fucking thing. It's fucking dumb.

722
03:06:43,399 --> 03:06:45,719
Why don't I just chat? I'm fucking the stream is fucking dumb.

723
03:06:47,719 --> 03:07:13,780
All right survive. I don't have any weapons. Climb up there. Climb over and kill him immediately.

724
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:50,100
Coughed. He pre-coughed. He pre-coughed on me. I'm oh it walls up. This is my like worst nightmare.

725
03:07:50,100 --> 03:08:12,780
Just being surrounded by these things. I'm gonna fucking believe. Why would I drink that up here?

726
03:08:13,659 --> 03:08:16,940
I don't know what's going on with my mind. Why would I drink that up there?

727
03:08:17,579 --> 03:08:24,459
I'm so angry about fucking coughing that it's it's malting me. I'm malting. Not malting. I'm

728
03:08:24,940 --> 03:08:54,809
gonna drop my skin. I need a weapon. Stop coughing when you get up on top. Oh my god. What is that?

729
03:08:54,809 --> 03:09:09,909
Oh my fucking god. Right? I'm not saying that. This is the last time you're gonna hear me say

730
03:09:10,549 --> 03:09:27,940
oh my fucking god. What the hell is that? What the hell?

731
03:09:29,139 --> 03:10:11,639
Oops. Perfect timing. Come on. Activate. Activate. You have to escape? No it said survive. Five

732
03:10:11,639 --> 03:10:17,500
thousand bits from David. Saved it. Thank you for the five thousand bits of German. Why are you

733
03:10:17,500 --> 03:10:27,719
being so mean to me? You're making me cry. David. You're fucking sick. You're the best.

734
03:10:28,520 --> 03:10:41,219
Final fight with TK. But thank you David. Thanks for the fifty dollar. That's a lot of money.

735
03:10:41,219 --> 03:10:53,000
Five thousand bits. I'll drink to that. Jesus.

736
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:07,319
Where's the checkpoint?

737
03:11:18,409 --> 03:11:19,370
What a bad photo.

738
03:11:21,930 --> 03:11:30,489
That would have been so good. He docked again in the worst possible time. What's wrong with Rebecca?

739
03:11:36,389 --> 03:12:04,170
Stop the bleeding. This won't be hard for me. You know how I do. Rebecca I'm sorry. All I have

740
03:12:04,170 --> 03:12:13,219
are pretzels and snacks. Devators you have like a fucking scepter that activates the ground.

741
03:12:14,100 --> 03:12:44,579
This probably looks bad to Rebecca. Like holy shit dude. Like you can't handle this. Watch out for

742
03:12:44,579 --> 03:12:51,270
fire. Let's go get it. All right. Do you have anything else besides like nails and orange juice?

743
03:13:05,420 --> 03:13:19,299
I'm trying to get like something out of the box. What is this? I just need weapons.

744
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:24,420
Cement saw. Okay finally. I just threw it over the cliff.

745
03:14:04,090 --> 03:14:30,329
Wrench. How did I miss? He's dead? Is he dead? Why would he do that?

746
03:14:30,329 --> 03:14:40,860
All right he's a big wave. All right I need to heal. That's not a heal. How do you avoid that shit?

747
03:14:40,860 --> 03:15:06,629
I need to heal. Heal. Heal. I can't. I can't. I can't do it. I need more healing. Oh he's gonna

748
03:15:06,629 --> 03:15:12,700
activate the shit. How do you blithely get over here without getting killed?

749
03:15:15,079 --> 03:15:27,590
Orange juice. I don't have. I know but fuck. Oh no I can see it but he blows the shit up.

750
03:15:28,549 --> 03:16:04,520
Oh they're gonna hit Rebecca. How do I prevent it from activating this stuff over here?

751
03:16:05,719 --> 03:16:08,979
Like he's just gonna. Here we go. I'm dead. Can I like jump anywhere?

752
03:16:14,600 --> 03:16:28,659
At least I got to taste it before I died. Okay I wonder if there's a. Do I have. How do I.

753
03:16:29,459 --> 03:16:33,930
How do I interrupt him from doing that? I have to do that whole thing again.

754
03:16:40,229 --> 03:16:46,680
So aggravating. I have to do the whole arena thing just to stand around arena thing again.

755
03:16:47,079 --> 03:17:03,879
I'm so. I'm so. I'm so mad by this. That it's making me go the wrong way. So before I fought

756
03:17:03,879 --> 03:17:11,110
that guy somebody said this is the worst boss in the game. I can see why. Not because of how

757
03:17:11,110 --> 03:17:15,750
how hard he is to fight but because I have to do this again. Does anybody know where that guy was?

758
03:17:17,319 --> 03:17:37,829
Where the fuck was that guy? He was over there. God damn it. All right I'm gonna start to save

759
03:17:37,829 --> 03:17:42,309
this stuff. I'm gonna try to hold on to as many weapons as I can. I'm just gonna jump around.

760
03:17:42,309 --> 03:17:45,030
I'm not gonna fight anything. Save the pretzels. Save the food.

761
03:17:46,649 --> 03:17:52,069
Save the bat too. I'm gonna try to see if I can get through this without. Oh I forgot the coffin

762
03:17:52,069 --> 03:17:58,709
exists in this game. Delete the coffin. Right now like the developers of this game like play this

763
03:17:58,709 --> 03:18:10,409
back and they go fuck man we should never play this like that. Hope nobody notices. Come on.

764
03:18:11,290 --> 03:18:25,590
Come on. What a great start.

765
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:38,469
You never know if I just have to activate this like three times or something.

766
03:18:38,469 --> 03:19:40,500
It's just a time limit. Let's see if it's time. Saw saw saw saw saw saw. I'm in trouble.

767
03:19:41,540 --> 03:20:12,649
I'm in trouble. I didn't even want to fall off. That's three times. It's not three times. It's

768
03:20:12,649 --> 03:20:23,290
just time. Oh ladies and gentlemen for the worst checkpoint. I don't want to do this again. I have

769
03:20:23,290 --> 03:20:29,049
to win. I don't want to do this again. I'm not doing this a third time. No human wants to do

770
03:20:29,049 --> 03:20:42,540
this for like a second or third time. I know there's like computer programs that like that

771
03:20:42,540 --> 03:20:53,690
to do this. I don't want to do that. Okay I still have not. I don't understand how

772
03:20:53,690 --> 03:21:03,860
this works. Because when you go too far away. Watch that.

773
03:21:06,819 --> 03:21:30,809
Why is he not getting hurt by that? Pick up the fucking orange juice.

774
03:21:31,610 --> 03:22:07,030
Stop tilting. He comes over and does that? Why didn't that hit him? Okay let's run around the

775
03:22:07,030 --> 03:22:29,299
circle until you. I need to heal Rebecca. There he goes. Does he run to the wall? Is this like a

776
03:22:29,299 --> 03:22:59,500
Mario game? Get over here so I can heal her. Just like taunt or something. How am I supposed to

777
03:22:59,500 --> 03:23:44,379
keep her healed when he never lets up the pressure? Heal? Oh my god. Oh no don't let him kill you.

778
03:23:44,379 --> 03:24:07,100
Don't let him kill you Jeremy. Don't let him do it. He's gonna try. Fuck that move.

779
03:24:08,059 --> 03:24:56,940
Ay yi yi he's gonna run. I just got mortal combated. All right. Mortal combat 2. Great.

780
03:25:16,090 --> 03:25:24,260
Should I just drink a bunch of shit? Just use the queen so we can see what it does.

781
03:25:25,059 --> 03:25:29,899
God I don't even have the queen anymore. All right let's do it.

782
03:25:30,620 --> 03:25:56,260
That is as effective as an attack fly from binding advisor. You don't throw it.

783
03:25:58,459 --> 03:26:01,899
What else do you do? All right I'm gonna drink this and run in. Drink up all.

784
03:26:15,770 --> 03:26:32,229
What is it? Nothing? I only got the painkiller. Is this last? I guess it works.

785
03:26:32,950 --> 03:27:15,059
Get this shit before we go up. No why did you jump that way?

786
03:27:15,940 --> 03:27:32,409
Okay. Okay. Get this queen? Holy shit kill everybody. I mean besides the camera freaking

787
03:27:32,409 --> 03:27:40,549
me out here. Is the camera broken right now? I think it is. Maybe not. Am I out of my mind?

788
03:27:40,549 --> 03:27:47,129
We're getting to wrestler levels of I was waiting for you to do that and we both knew

789
03:27:47,129 --> 03:27:49,049
at the same time you're moving to jump with my heart.

790
03:28:17,379 --> 03:28:40,629
Why puke? I didn't drink anything. Line him up. My baseball bat. Give me like the beer. Give the

791
03:28:40,629 --> 03:29:18,409
bat. What else is over here? Anything? Any secret items? Special items? Queen? I need the bat.

792
03:29:18,969 --> 03:29:49,219
Let me try this again. God damn. All right gotta hit him with the bat and then he'll run away.

793
03:29:49,860 --> 03:30:15,510
I'm cocky with this shit. This thing's freaking me out. Get away from me B.

794
03:30:29,049 --> 03:30:56,280
No! Rebecca please move your head. I want the snack. Why do you gotta do it like that? I'm standing

795
03:30:56,280 --> 03:31:07,829
in front of it. You have to make it so messy. I want that not the three boxes surrounding it.

796
03:31:07,829 --> 03:31:18,120
How is that so hard to understand? It just it like cycles through all of them in a half a second.

797
03:31:18,120 --> 03:32:11,399
It's like just fucking stay on one of them. Molding! I didn't stop halfway. Where'd it go?

798
03:32:11,959 --> 03:32:25,209
Holy shit! No!

799
03:32:31,239 --> 03:32:54,200
Run away. Give me that health. Come on run away. Are you? I got baited. Are you what? Are you

800
03:32:54,200 --> 03:33:31,829
kidding me? Are you fucking serious? Why is he not running away? Are you serious? Are you serious?

801
03:33:42,700 --> 03:33:54,340
They're dead. I'll be back in Dead Rising 3.

802
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:15,260
Hey what do you say? Break the story.

803
03:34:21,270 --> 03:34:27,110
Doesn't that exact same? That was just Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Doesn't that happen? That's like

804
03:34:27,110 --> 03:34:32,229
ice. There's a frame from that. That's Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Nice try. I mean nice try for a

805
03:34:32,229 --> 03:34:50,809
jump scare but he almost got me. That's the car commercial thing. Almost. Long time for that one.

806
03:34:51,530 --> 03:35:27,209
Monsters Inc theme song. That was good. It was constant conflict in the chat before I picked

807
03:35:27,209 --> 03:35:33,690
that in this game and sometimes constant conflict is you know I'm not even going to try it. Well I

808
03:35:33,690 --> 03:36:18,579
even bring it up. There's no reason to say that you were going to do Dead Rising 2 after this.

809
03:36:20,379 --> 03:36:26,299
That may have been a rage statement. Was it? All right let me ask you a question. Before I said that

810
03:36:26,299 --> 03:36:32,620
did I just get grabbed by a zombie or was that potentially like the fourth retry of a boss?

811
03:36:33,500 --> 03:36:54,540
Are we sure? Why did they say that? Was it like a quell? I think that may have been a

812
03:36:54,540 --> 03:37:06,170
quell the audience state. No I'm not going to stream Dead Rising again tomorrow. Four hours?

813
03:37:06,649 --> 03:37:19,860
Let me see what else there is to do. 10 of the last like 11 streams.

814
03:37:21,299 --> 03:37:28,489
They're very good. They're fun. I know you can't know what I'm saying. You know what this music

815
03:37:28,489 --> 03:37:43,739
sounds like so let's just turn it off. Hi. I think you can hear me now. So yeah I'm not doing like

816
03:37:44,459 --> 03:37:56,969
10 out of 11 streams of Dead Rising 3. I do want to play Dead Rising 3 just not right now.

817
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:13,450
Maybe like in December. Somewhere. We'll put it somewhere. I promise. He's never going to

818
03:38:13,450 --> 03:38:30,139
play it? Yeah yes I am. I said I was never going to play four. All right is there any after credit

819
03:38:30,139 --> 03:38:42,170
sequences or anything? You said you played Devil May Cry 5. Yeah but in a world where we're spoiled

820
03:38:42,170 --> 03:38:48,809
rotten with millions of probably video games and I'm counting iOS like trash can stuff too.

821
03:38:49,610 --> 03:38:54,569
There's like thousands and thousands of great experiences. It's hard to do them all.

822
03:38:54,569 --> 03:38:59,370
You got to find out when you want to do them. It's hard. I started God of War like two months

823
03:38:59,370 --> 03:39:06,250
ago or so. I'm like 30% of the way through the game. I can't go back because I just

824
03:39:06,250 --> 03:39:11,690
were overstimulated with video games now. Like 50 new games come out like every fucking three weeks.

825
03:39:13,989 --> 03:39:26,629
Oh wait. ADHD? No there's a lot of games. A lot of games. I'm talking even ones that I never

826
03:39:26,629 --> 03:39:35,129
played before like this. All right I got game ending S. Zombies killed 39. Say that's too bad.

827
03:39:35,129 --> 03:39:44,340
It's not even 4,000. 25 survivors. 4.3 million dollars. Would you like to save the game? Yes I

828
03:39:44,340 --> 03:39:57,059
would. What about the new Star Wars game? I don't know. It's too many things. Let's just go with one.

829
03:39:58,020 --> 03:40:11,559
There are two DLCs. I mean there's DLC for the DLC. Wait start game.

830
03:40:12,280 --> 03:40:25,799
Anything new? Looks like it's just ending S. Yeah new game sandbox mode. What is sandbox?

831
03:40:25,799 --> 03:40:33,260
I'm assuming it just doesn't do the sandbox challenge. Do I have to like eat a bowl of

832
03:40:33,260 --> 03:40:40,280
cinnamon? Right here. Right here. That's it. You too. Thanks man. Appreciate that. Just the two of you?

833
03:40:41,739 --> 03:40:44,629
Oh all right whatever. You guys are fucking cool.

834
03:40:51,780 --> 03:41:00,469
There's no time limit. Cray survivors roam the city. What? I'm going back in.

835
03:41:01,430 --> 03:41:22,440
Play on the last wrong save. Use the existing save. Hold on. Hold on. All right I can't just jump

836
03:41:22,440 --> 03:41:38,440
off. So load save one? That's not going to show us the credits again? Oh would you look at that?

837
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:46,379
You just did. Ah yeah. That's my favorite kind of pasta. Angel hair spaghetti.

838
03:41:58,180 --> 03:42:09,540
Bad? How could angel hair spaghetti be bad when it's the same fucking thing? It's all the same

839
03:42:09,540 --> 03:42:18,180
thing. It's just spaghetti. It's just smaller and thinner. It's too thin. No it it you don't I don't

840
03:42:18,180 --> 03:42:25,850
want I don't want my pasta to soak up all that gross sauce. Angel hair pasta. A little bit of

841
03:42:25,850 --> 03:42:35,850
butter. A sprinkle of olive oil. That's how they eat it in Italy. And that's how I eat it. I missed

842
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:41,139
the fucking first part. What was it? A little bit of olive oil on the pasta. That's how they

843
03:42:41,139 --> 03:43:03,700
eat it in Italy. Well how do they eat it in Italy? Huh? How do they eat it in Italy? Hey you know

844
03:43:03,700 --> 03:43:10,739
they made up lasagna for Americans. You know that right? I'm missing important stuff.

845
03:43:16,389 --> 03:43:40,090
How do Italians eat their food? They relax and socialize while dining for hours.

846
03:43:44,260 --> 03:43:49,379
Over lunch and dinner and coffee Italians enjoy a diet rich in fruits, vegetables,

847
03:43:49,379 --> 03:43:56,020
beans, fish, poultry, olive oil, tomatoes, whole grains, dairy, red wine, and they eat very little

848
03:43:56,100 --> 03:44:11,079
red meat. They dine for hours. Oh it's you. You guys eat too fast. We've already gone over this

849
03:44:11,079 --> 03:44:20,709
shit man. We don't have to go over this again. Everyone just watch like. Oh it hurts going in.

850
03:44:20,709 --> 03:44:36,469
Oh okay. Relax have a have a glass of water. Okay here's a challenge. Kill as many zombies

851
03:44:36,469 --> 03:45:03,450
as you can in 30 seconds. 40 kills? How do I do this this fast? I know I wasted time.

852
03:45:03,450 --> 03:45:22,600
Fuck it. This is sandbox mode. I just get to let my hair down. My hair. My hair.

853
03:45:24,200 --> 03:45:30,299
This is actually kind of cool. All right let me try to get it. I gotta get at least 10.

854
03:45:30,299 --> 03:45:42,940
What's better? Baseball bat's probably better. Go. I'm gonna turn around. Great. I wonder if

855
03:45:43,020 --> 03:46:16,170
there's a gun or something. Less than last time. I need some. I need a weapon. I need some weapons.

856
03:46:16,889 --> 03:46:28,180
Something better than what I have. Why did I drink that? I need a tutor.

857
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:39,100
Hey that was so funny. I forgot to laugh. That's such an old saying but that makes it. How does

858
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:55,930
it make any sense? That was so funny I forgot to laugh. Is there a grenade? No. Because you

859
03:46:55,930 --> 03:47:34,620
aren't laughing. Why would you forget to laugh? All right so you probably have to come back up

860
03:47:34,620 --> 03:47:42,180
here with better weapons. 40 people? There's no way that's gonna happen. Not with a wrench.

861
03:47:53,719 --> 03:48:09,510
I'm almost dead. I forgot. Is there a reason why I don't have a super health? I have to wait to

862
03:48:09,510 --> 03:48:13,510
go to the main menu and start from the main menu. Not the costume though.

863
03:48:13,510 --> 03:48:21,100
No. Yeah this is the right save. Otherwise I wouldn't have the costume.

864
03:48:23,860 --> 03:48:34,100
Right? Yeah. It is know you can jump on the boxes. How did somebody not tell me that?

865
03:48:34,739 --> 03:48:56,469
It would last like 16 hours of this game. We did. No you didn't. Let's find another challenge.

866
03:48:56,469 --> 03:49:00,309
I actually kind of like this. This is fun. Plus I'm never playing Dead Rising 2 ever again so

867
03:49:00,309 --> 03:49:21,500
it doesn't mean. Let's go. A lot of snacks. Who the? Gordon? Gordon what are you doing? What?

868
03:49:22,379 --> 03:49:48,229
There's a guy just waiting for me. It's Gordon. I feel like I'm playing. Where did he just drop?

869
03:49:48,950 --> 03:49:58,149
He's got money. All right can you save them? Kill 41 more zombies to unlock this challenge.

870
03:49:59,030 --> 03:50:19,379
That seems like a lot. I'm immediately playing the original version despite you guys. Is that

871
03:50:19,379 --> 03:50:31,399
what I said? This doesn't sound like me. I don't know. I feel like that doesn't sound like me.

872
03:50:32,200 --> 03:50:38,149
Well there's a chain. Okay well let's take the chainsaw upstairs. Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

873
03:50:38,149 --> 03:50:50,389
Let's do this right. No it's machete and push broom. Yeah and then let's do just give me the

874
03:50:50,389 --> 03:51:02,969
chainsaw. I'm gonna go back up and use the chainsaw and get 40 kills. Right? I did a second vote but

875
03:51:02,969 --> 03:51:13,930
I was already in the game and I already bought the damn thing. Damn it. Paddle and chainsaw?

876
03:51:14,649 --> 03:51:43,079
Does that work? Let's wait till he gets up. Paddle and chainsaw. Did you say palette? Paddle. Where's

877
03:51:43,079 --> 03:51:54,020
the paddle? Is there a paddle over here? It's paddle on the dumpster. Nice eyes. Nice eyes.

878
03:51:54,020 --> 03:52:01,510
Seriously. I was away for a while to de-start over it. Yeah I got really really frustrated

879
03:52:01,750 --> 03:52:09,430
and like I was punching my desk and stuff so I just figured I'd start over. Paddle saw.

880
03:52:10,389 --> 03:52:15,719
Yeah I know what that does. Hell yeah. I was punching my desk and going

881
03:52:19,530 --> 03:52:32,020
and fucking tears were just streaming down my face. Should I go back up and just get the 40 one?

882
03:52:32,579 --> 03:52:45,139
I feel like I can get it easily. Okay it was like screaming and crying.

883
03:52:54,889 --> 03:53:03,219
It was really really embarrassing and then you heard that.

884
03:53:14,680 --> 03:53:41,530
40? Let's get it. How many are over here? Come on come on over there. 40. Gold status. I'll take it.

885
03:53:41,530 --> 03:53:52,520
Why does this guy remind me of Adam Sandler? What are you talking about like 1995 Adam Sandler or

886
03:53:52,520 --> 03:54:06,250
like 2008 Adam Sandler? Boomstick. Nice. All right cool let's keep going.

887
03:54:12,120 --> 03:54:27,000
2019 Adam Sandler. I'm not sure I agree. Holy shit.

888
03:54:36,250 --> 03:54:40,329
I want to do the other challenge. I don't want to use this yet. It's probably killed like 30

889
03:54:40,329 --> 03:55:01,500
zombies in 20 seconds. Gain as much pp as you can in 60 seconds. It's about to break yeah.

890
03:55:02,219 --> 03:55:07,579
People saying you gotta go back to the menu and start in the menu.

891
03:55:17,159 --> 03:55:23,620
Thousand pp. I don't think that's gonna happen.

892
03:55:31,770 --> 03:55:49,940
That counts? You get a big one. Will all these people count?

893
03:55:54,489 --> 03:56:00,760
They're not very much. Go back to the challenge area.

894
03:56:03,979 --> 03:56:13,399
All right I'm gonna start the game from the menu because everyone's telling me that I somehow did

895
03:56:13,399 --> 03:56:42,180
this wrong. I have the costume now. Why do I have the costume? Sandbox mode.

896
03:56:48,329 --> 03:56:58,549
You guys you guys thought I got baited? No I did too. I was waiting for it. No that's real.

897
03:56:59,190 --> 03:57:05,110
Actually you have to start it from the menu. That's the reality. I might be able to do this

898
03:57:06,069 --> 03:57:15,690
all right hold on. I wonder if I can do it because I'm leveled up. Level 33? Yeah let's try it.

899
03:57:27,579 --> 03:57:36,489
Yeah that's much better. I might not get 40 but.

900
03:57:49,299 --> 03:58:15,139
Oh my arms just fell backwards in my chair. Oh without the bat maybe I can't. Yeah I don't

901
03:58:15,139 --> 03:58:26,040
think I can do it. Sledgehammer? I might be able to spin. What's the spin with a sledgehammer?

902
03:58:30,090 --> 03:58:59,639
Maybe. Maybe. I'm not turning off my face cam. You want a face cam? No. Nope.

903
03:59:09,959 --> 03:59:18,120
This is cool. All right I think. I think. I'm gonna. It's losing me a little.

904
03:59:19,139 --> 03:59:29,239
I'm gonna go down. I'm gonna go down and see. It's losing me. I'm gonna go down here and see if I

905
03:59:29,239 --> 03:59:44,659
see if it can grab me again. I have to get into where I was before. Let's see. I'm glad for the

906
03:59:44,659 --> 03:59:55,670
better inventory. Yeah the next game we're playing is Katamari. That's the next up on the list.

907
04:00:02,250 --> 04:00:09,350
Katamari tonight? Yes. We will at least start Katamari tonight and we'll keep going tomorrow.

908
04:00:09,350 --> 04:00:14,569
Because I don't. I'm definitely. Oh there's Gordon. Remember Gordon?

909
04:00:18,889 --> 04:00:21,239
That's good stuff.

910
04:00:37,049 --> 04:00:41,479
Pig swing. Got you.

911
04:00:51,450 --> 04:00:59,819
Don't let me do that. Okay 13 more. Let's see. Knife.

912
04:01:06,899 --> 04:01:11,700
It's starting to lose me. It's losing me. All right 10 more minutes and we'll see where I am.

913
04:01:17,659 --> 04:01:31,620
No let's see a paddle. Don't play this for 13 more hours. I don't even stream for 13 hours.

914
04:01:34,520 --> 04:01:41,420
We won Katamari do you? Hold on. Just a minute. I want to try. This is actually really really

915
04:01:41,420 --> 04:01:59,260
cool though. All right let's go. I beat the game. Got the true ending. Got to overtime. I looked at

916
04:02:00,139 --> 04:02:09,159
Katamari. Dead Rising 2 off the record was awesome. I suggest you play it. Just trying to get too

917
04:02:09,159 --> 04:02:25,780
frustrated. I have to switch over to this. This might take a minute. Beautiful Katamari for the

918
04:02:25,780 --> 04:02:31,139
Xbox 3. That was a fast 10 minutes it was. I got grabbed though and I couldn't handle it anymore.

919
04:02:31,139 --> 04:02:46,250
It's really easy if you're not an idiot. What is easy? Are you talking to me? Dead Rising 2.

920
04:02:50,840 --> 04:02:59,319
This game's not easy. I'm sorry. I ain't gonna have somebody with like their fucking

921
04:03:00,120 --> 04:03:07,850
Boy Scout badges. I beat Dead Rising 2. I get it now too. I get to wear that badge.

922
04:03:17,059 --> 04:03:20,500
Add it to the gamer license. Yeah I get it. It's a it's point. No I don't want it. I don't want

923
04:03:20,500 --> 04:03:46,069
points on my license. You didn't 100% it. All right. Okay. Sorry. I'll bring my badge back.

924
04:03:46,069 --> 04:03:51,620
I'll put it on the table. I beat the DLC and not the main game badge which is harder than the

925
04:03:51,620 --> 04:04:07,510
original game. Do I get it? Thank you. I beat the hard one. Did you beat the hard one? Not cannon

926
04:04:07,510 --> 04:04:15,459
points. All right. Let's get let's get on. I could use a different controller.
