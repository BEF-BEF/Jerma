1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,889
Yeah, I thought everybody was ignoring me. Like, there's no way that all of them can collectively

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:10,650
pretend that I'm not streaming. I was like, this is kind of crazy.

3
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:20,039
It's like, all right, maybe they can. Because I saw a bunch of- I saw at least five or six people

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,039
in all capitals live, live, live. But I think people just say that, no matter what, just to,

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,960
I guess, fuck with other people to pretend that I was live. Like, they had a stream, but other

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,109
people didn't. I was like, wait, how does that make any sense? I was sitting here talking to

7
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:43,670
nothing for at least 60 seconds. I did a Twitch broadcast test, an internet test. I was just

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,229
checking different things with this new connection to see what the best route is. And I think I got

9
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:57,590
it. I forgot it was on. So, it was still on when I pressed the now it's time to really stream. We

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,739
have 10 community subs from the chef's corner. The chef's corner has been incredibly generous

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,439
lately. Thank you, chef's corner. Appreciate it. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Welcome back,

12
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,730
though, guys. Hi, nice to see you. We have a very, very interesting week planned ahead of us here.

13
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,209
Well, mid-week into weekend. We're going to go back to the crack game. I just- the drug dealer

14
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,620
simulator. The crack game. We're just going to call it the crack game. That's what it is.

15
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:35,189
A nondescript civilian. Thanks for 10 community subs. 10 from nondescript and 10 from the chef's

16
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,590
corner. Thanks, both of you guys. Yeah, we're going to play the drug dealer game again just

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,950
for a little bit. I just want to play it. I'm kind of into it. I'll probably get my fill of it today.

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,719
Who knows? But tomorrow, we're going to get the real- the real schedule here. Because I've been

19
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,000
flipping it around because like, oh, it's going to be Thursday. That's going to be on Saturday.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,359
That's going to be on Sunday. But that's going to be on Friday. But I want to play the crack game.

21
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,420
So let's- let's get it for real with the real thing here. Crack game tonight. Tomorrow,

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,060
we're going to do community content night. That leaves us with the weekend of Friday and Saturday.

23
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,280
Friday is going to be movie night. So that will actually be happening on Friday. Public domain

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,280
movie night is Friday. Like, that's- that's just it. That's the one- that's the day it's going to be.

25
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,509
Saturday is supposed to be the Easy Bake Oven stream. But I'm- I'm telling you right now,

26
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:31,580
I'm having a little bit of reservations on it for one reason. I can't- I- this- a space.

27
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,060
I probably am going to have to go to the studio to do the Easy Bake Oven stream.

28
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:49,819
Now imagine taking that phone call. Oh yeah, this is- this is the movie studio. Hi, yeah,

29
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:56,219
remember me? Oh yeah, the green screen guy. Yeah, that's me. What can I do for you? Oh, you know,

30
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:03,530
thinking about coming and using your space to use an Easy Bake Oven. That's all. I just want to use

31
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,259
an Easy Bake Oven at the studio. Oh, you just- that's it. Yeah, that's it. I just have like

32
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,680
20 recipes. Why don't you just do it at your house? Well, you know, because I want the space and I

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,520
want to be able to like fucking do like lookabays and stuff. I can't like- there's not enough space

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,780
with the cameras to catch me doing like lookabay when in the middle of it. Oh, that makes perfect

35
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:34,229
sense, Mr. Albertson. Absolutely. So, if I cannot get studio space by Saturday, then I'm- we're

36
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:39,050
gonna- we'll do it like a day or two later. But I'm gonna be in the studio for the Easy Bake Oven

37
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,740
stream. It just- I'm just gonna. Like, whatever. I'm gonna put like a fucking chef background

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:56,860
behind me on the green screen. It'll be a- it'll be a mess. Don't worry. Is the studio open? Oh,

39
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:09,189
shit. Ah, yeah. That's another thing, isn't it? Huh. Well, I- here's the thing. I have to assume

40
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:16,939
maybe because- oh, no. No, it's not. It probably won't be, right? Because it's like a- because

41
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:27,019
there's no- like, oh. I'll check. I'll check. I'll see. Because when you rent studio space,

42
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,500
nobody else is- nobody's there. It's like you're- you're renting part of the studio. So,

43
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,990
it's not like there'll be a bunch of people around. Um, I have no idea. I have to make a

44
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:45,100
few phone calls. Oh, Easy Bake Oven stream. Fucking cancelled. No. Uh, I just wanted to have

45
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:53,529
some more space. Oh, and the Toontown stream. First was the Toontown stream. No. Let's- let's

46
00:04:53,529 --> 00:05:00,459
see what happens. If I have to do it from here, I will. But I have to set up the cameras in a way

47
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:06,220
where I can see everything. Because I don't want to have a- all right, listen. For streams that

48
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,540
happen when I'm on camera, I don't want another unlock card game stream. And what I mean by that

49
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,939
is forget about how fucking bad that stream could have- potentially was because the stream was just

50
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:23,100
bad, right? Let's talk about like how you couldn't see anything. You couldn't read the text. You

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:33,160
couldn't see the close-up. I want to make sure that there's like- you can see stuff. That stream

52
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,279
was horrible. I don't think it was horrible. It was bad. It was pretty bad because you couldn't

53
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:45,240
even like see. You couldn't read. I couldn't do basic children's math problems. Yeah, and you

54
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,000
couldn't read anything. The camera wasn't good enough. You know what I mean? I want to make sure

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,279
I don't fall down that path again. It wasn't as bad as Hearthstone. Wow, you must have hated that

56
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:04,259
stream. You must have hated that Hearthstone stream. But anyways, we're gonna play a more crack game.

57
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,180
Just gonna play it for a few hours. And then tomorrow, community content night,

58
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,899
I will get that prepared. It should be community content night up until-

59
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:21,939
like I'm like forever behind on community content night. We might have to do like a lightning round

60
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:29,379
to catch up because it's gonna be from like February like 10th- 15th or something to like March

61
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:37,139
15th. I'm gonna be forever like 30 days behind community content night. And I even did

62
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:53,959
two to- I didn't want to catch up and it didn't matter. No, skip. No, skip. No, skip. You're a

63
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,720
year behind the green screen stream. Well, if I get into the studio, then I can do a little bit

64
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:08,459
in front of the screen. I'll be there. But let's play. I'm gonna play this video game.

65
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:17,100
Or you know what it is. Move the thing so you can see. He's a year behind on VR. That's not

66
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,399
true. When was the last time I played VR? I played VR. I thought that was in my house.

67
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,589
I thought this was my room. And that just scared the shit out of me. I was like,

68
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:39,050
somebody open my door? When was the last time I played VR? It wasn't a year ago. It was like

69
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,250
two months ago. It was a long time ago. All right, what were we doing? I just got access to

70
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:53,060
ecstasy. By the way, I'm like just thinking about this right now. If you happen to

71
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,740
not know what was going on in here, and you just heard like from outside the door,

72
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,589
or like if you heard me talking like this, what would do you think? That'd be weird, right?

73
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,949
Okay, yeah, so I just got access to ecstasy. How much should I buy?

74
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm gonna say like 20 grams of ecstasy and I'll sell the amphetamines.

75
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:23,750
That's I'm gonna be like quiet. Okay, I'm gonna like say these things quietly. I don't know.

76
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,269
You know what I mean? Like that's just fucking weird. All right, so I'm gonna call it. No,

77
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm gonna. All right, there's orders. Remember Whisper, my mom's in the room. Drugs, drugs,

78
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,600
drugs, drugs. How did I just do that? That was 50 fucking thousand dollars from Freddy Dredd.

79
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,750
Freddy Dredd just gave 50 community subs. Freddy Dredd just drops thousands of dollars here.

80
00:08:50,710 --> 00:09:02,679
The man, Freddy Dredd. Thanks a lot, Freddy. Thanks for the 50 fucking subs. That's so much.

81
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:11,029
Like I've, I've dropped like 100 community subs before. I've dropped like 500 community subs

82
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:22,789
before. That's a lot. Like 20, 30, 40, 50 subs, 100 subs. That's fucking a lot of money. It's,

83
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,110
I can't even believe people would do it. Thanks so much for fucking doing it.

84
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:31,909
That was a humble brag. No, no, that's me saying like I looked at my bank account after doing it

85
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:45,049
and went, holy fucking shit. That's a lot of money. But thanks, Freddy. And I'm just like,

86
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,970
I'm shocked that people want to give me that kind of money. That's what I'm saying. Thank you.

87
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,840
Flex, flex, flex. I just did it and it wasn't even on camera, but you know what I did?

88
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,750
I did, you, you, you saw it in your head. I didn't even need to do it on camera.

89
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,110
My fist went up, my fucking boink. I went like that, you know, like bonk.

90
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:15,610
All right. I got a fucking play. All right. I need weed, six grams of weed, two grams of amps.

91
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:25,419
No ecstasy, anymore weed. Okay. We need six grams of, uh, marijuana. Do I have marijuana? I do.

92
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:35,049
I need six grams. I'm almost out of marijuana. Fuck. And I have to buy more. What do I have?

93
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:41,429
Okay. So now I need, what do I need? Amphetamines and MDMA? I remember when this was a wholesome

94
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:47,289
Twitch channel. Not anymore. I've activated the mature audience filter. That means that if you

95
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:56,889
click on this stream, you are agreeing that you are a mature audience member. It has been activated.

96
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:03,299
Why do I keep thinking this shit is happening in my real fucking place? I was like, what? I was like,

97
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:14,809
are we being invaded? What the fuck is going on? I like, what am I supposed to, I keep thinking

98
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:23,559
this stuff is real. All right. We have six grams of marijuana. We have 10 more community subs on

99
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:29,240
top of the fucking shit load that I've already come through from numb legs. Thank you. Numb legs

100
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:39,110
for the 10 subs and more fucking oink. Six grams of, what was it? Weed. Okay. Two amphetamine.

101
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:48,039
Four amphetamine. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine.

102
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:57,820
Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six ecstasy. No. Six amphetamine. Six amphetamine.

103
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:16,220
Two, four, six. Two, what was it? MDMA. Do I have any MDMA or is it gone? One. Oh, here we go. Yeah,

104
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,899
I got, what am I, what are these other things? It's been a couple of days. I don't know. What

105
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:26,460
is this stuff? Dry rub amphetamine. One pack of ecstasy. One pack of new, new sugar mix mix.

106
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:39,139
And then $70. Okay. Well, I can, I can deliver this shit. Gotta be aware. 16 of, oh man. Okay.

107
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:54,389
Hold on. I need 16 more. All right. 16 of MDMA. What was this other one? Mike Byers. Oh right. I

108
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:59,379
just bought a place. All right. I'm ready to take all these. Here we go. I'm gonna make some money

109
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:15,450
here. That's my dealer, right? Yeah. What are my skill points again? All right. Illusionist.

110
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:26,019
So what's, what's, what's the actual percentage? What's the actual percentage? Bernie, what do

111
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:32,980
you mean? Bernie and Bernie in chat. Bernie Sanders in chat. The real Bernie's in chat.

112
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,779
I don't think that's not, I don't believe so. I don't think so. I really don't believe so.

113
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:48,580
Oh, it's probably a fake name. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a fake name. All right. I got it.

114
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:58,330
I got a delivery. It's cause somebody gifted him a sub. Yeah. All right. So yeah. That trick

115
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,129
only works a handful of times guys, before you sub every single game developer to me,

116
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:10,470
every major Twitch broadcaster and like five out of 10 of the celebrities I've talked about.

117
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:19,029
Like, holy shit dude. Wait, Jim Carrey was here? At Jim Carrey. He's got a sub dude. He's fucking

118
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:28,490
subbed. What? Jim Carrey subbed me? There's only so many times you can play that joke before I know.

119
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:41,720
All right. I'm looking for the police. All right. We're good. Nope. But he, he doesn't know. No,

120
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:50,250
I know. I do know. I got, when was the dealer? He wanted two grams of amphetamines.

121
00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:03,000
One, two grand pack. Thank you sir. $24. Every, oh dude, did you know every celebrity you've ever

122
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,500
heard of all subscribes to you? Two grams of amphetamines. You got it. Oh shit. They don't

123
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:29,000
see me, right? No. All right. I gotta go. I gotta go across the street. Holy shit. I can't believe

124
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:38,840
real Taylor Swift and then, hey, super frog. Thank you super Bruce for the 20 subs. This is

125
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,629
just back to back to back to back to back subs. Thanks for the 20 subs, dude. Seriously.

126
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,549
That's so much money. That's so much money. Thank you super frog.

127
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:03,860
Oh, thanks Bruce. Oh, this is the big one. This is 16. 16 grams. Take it. There you go.

128
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,899
And I got you right next to you, Donald. He wanted the six grams of marijuana.

129
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,210
There you are. I'm almost at level uh, what was level eight, level 10? I've done almost all of

130
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:29,179
them. Can you fast travel or something? One of these days somebody's actually going to be here.

131
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,220
One of these days somebody's actually going to click on this fucking shitty stream

132
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,220
because somebody like linked them and they're going to just, they're going to show up and it,

133
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:47,899
what? No, no, no. Well, yeah. Let me finish my thought. Like, hey, dude. Oh, Taylor Swift.

134
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:52,059
Check out this streamer. Oh, he's so cool. And they're going to get here and I'm just going to be

135
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:59,590
going. And this, this is what happens when you make a fucking joke. This is what happens. This is what

136
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:15,660
you deserve. This is what I deserve. Where's my house? Where's my house? Oh my God. Long story

137
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,059
short, there ain't no fucking celebrities here. There's no one here. Nobody's here. It's just you.

138
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,420
It's just you and me. We're the only two people that are here. It's just us. And I just lost the

139
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,259
money that I just sold. It's just like us, us 5,000 people. There ain't no celebrities. There's like,

140
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:42,779
Bobby Flay's not here, guys. Okay. It's okay. See, see right now somewhere in sunny California,

141
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:50,490
Bobby Flay is in his, is in his pajamas sitting there watching German 95 going, oh shit.

142
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,700
Oh, I don't know. Nobody thinks it's real. That's all right. Holy shit though. Wow. That was almost

143
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:20,599
bad. I can't fucking believe I lost everything. No, that was going so well. Oh, God damn it.

144
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,680
What do these guys want? At least I got the, I got the, I got the ecstasy to the dealer though.

145
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:32,710
That's the good thing. That was a family guy joke. No, that was a Jeremy Elbertson joke because I

146
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,769
just said it. Just because family guy goes like, Hey, wouldn't it be funny if, wouldn't it be funny

147
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,390
if, doesn't mean anybody else can go, Hey, wouldn't it be funny if, his family guy has not tarnished

148
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,309
the wouldn't it be funny if scenario. I refuse to believe that. And if they did, then that's a sad

149
00:18:46,309 --> 00:19:03,319
day. All right, let's go back to the house. Oh, now we're going to say F. Oh, now we're, no, F's in

150
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:10,619
the chat, huh? That's so funny. It's hysterical. People do F's in the chat. Oh, he's getting

151
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:20,019
fibrid. Wait, wait, what? I knew I should, I did all those tests. I, I shouldn't have done that.

152
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,059
I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that. It's all right. I changed servers.

153
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:41,940
I shouldn't have done that. I knew it. I shouldn't have done it. Which one of these is my house?

154
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,539
See, I was doing through the VPN. I was just testing different servers. Which one's, hey,

155
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,380
but maybe let's try this one and see what the speeds on this one are. And I changed it and I

156
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,380
was like, yeah, that one, that one looks good. And I was fine. I don't know why I changed the

157
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,700
server. It was my own fault, but it's fine. All right. I still have plenty of drugs. Don't worry.

158
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Did we just get somebody's more money come in? Are you feeling the burn? Thanks to the five

159
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:14,250
community subs and sweaty man. Thanks for five community subs using a VPN. Yeah. And it works

160
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:27,450
perfectly good. But I, I, what, why, why, why is this such a problem? No, I'm not streaming with

161
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,250
that. I'm not streaming with the one that people get paid to use. Okay. It's a different one.

162
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,289
And it's a secret because I don't know. It's, I like, I don't know. I have, I have my,

163
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:53,319
my virtual private fucking station, whatever it is, VPS. What? I don't use that one. No,

164
00:20:53,319 --> 00:21:04,119
that's not the one. I don't use that one. No, I don't use that one. Stop saying that. You're

165
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,039
going to get me in trouble and I don't want to get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble.

166
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:16,619
I've done. No, that's that one. No, it's not. All right. Okay. You guys are distracting the

167
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:23,099
fuck out of me today. I got arrested because you were distracting me. That's a real drug deal

168
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,970
like that. Hey, you got the stuff? Yeah, I got the stuff. All right. Hey, yeah. Come over here.

169
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:38,329
What do I owe you? You owe me. Hold on a second. I got a phone call. Hey, hey, hey, imagine if

170
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:45,289
Bobby Flay was, was calling me right now. Hey, Bobby Flay. Hey, it's me, Bobby Flay.

171
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:49,369
Can you imagine, dude? No, I think it's my mom. Hey, can we just like get this over with and,

172
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,650
whoa, I hear the, hold on. I think I hear the police, man. Hey, we're over here.

173
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,289
Imagine if they came over here after I yelled at them. Hey, look at this. Hey, have you ever

174
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:06,890
seen somebody do a stance like this? And you do like a fucking look at me. That person does

175
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:22,220
not keep going. I can't figure out if this is a minus two or a plus two. You don't have to

176
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:30,019
figure it out at all. Just fucking watch the TV. Why don't we have so many fucking

177
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:38,259
comedy detectives in here? Just watch the television. I'm trying to figure out if I

178
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:54,650
liked that or not. Let me do some math. All right, let's put this down. Wait, let me check the TV.

179
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:03,460
It's not, it's a laptop. Nobody to write. I got, at least I got it off to her. This is the important

180
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:16,170
one. I have nothing. Did I just sleep? No offense, but I think the look at me thing is really dumb.

181
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:22,819
Me too. That's the only thing that pays the bills nowadays. Okay. So just give me, just let me do

182
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:37,349
it every now and then, man. Come on. Come on, man. Oh, I got three words. Look at me, me and

183
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:53,589
the spider one. Just shut the fuck up, man. You're trying to ruin this for me. Take this out. I need

184
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:58,390
new clients. I need my, did they take the bag too? Please don't tell me they took the bag. Okay,

185
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,380
thank God. Hey, Justice Nugget, thanks for the five community subs. And what does he say every

186
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:14,730
time he gets five community subs? He says, look at me. Thanks though. Jesus Christ. Ballinx, thanks

187
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:23,819
for the five subs and Justice Nugget, thanks for the five subs. I have to give these free samples

188
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:35,720
away to people. Pick this up. Until I get my drug deal. What are the tasks? I need five addicts.

189
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,539
Check out the furniture shop. I already did that. Two grams of ecstasy, two grams of ecstasy,

190
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:48,599
two grams of ediphenibine, two grams of ecstasy. I have that. Okay. Thank God. Didn't take everything.

191
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:58,940
Store this. Actually keep a little bit out. Oh, this is the mixed up shit. This is the thing you

192
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,619
guys are all screaming. Wait a minute. This is not even ecstasy. I just faked myself out.

193
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:08,740
This is the fake shit. And I just thought it was real. That means it's good. I'll keep the

194
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:25,670
marijuana. Put the money away. I want to break this up. Let's put that on here. All right, here we go.

195
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:33,160
Finally. No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. I hate F. Everybody else like hate F where E should be.

196
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:54,279
You know what I mean? I feel like that's not just me. F, F. Oh, no. No. Okay. You wanted to

197
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:04,759
put the rest of this shit away. No, put... I'm just gonna... Can I just throw this in the trash?

198
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:14,819
How do you get rid of drugs? I know this is not looking up how to dispose of a battery,

199
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,609
right? How do you get rid of batteries? But still, what am I supposed to do?

200
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay, put this away. I want enough to give a couple samples out. All right, let's go.

201
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:41,670
I'm gonna get fucking arrested again. You cook a steak with it. You eat them. You don't waste them.

202
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:47,980
You don't waste... Did you hear that? I was like... I can't even do that again. Yes, I do. I have a

203
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:55,930
backpack on. That was like a full-on like... Wow, that was... I can't even replicate that.

204
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:06,410
Let's go. Is this thing bugged though? Because remember I went in the furniture shop last time?

205
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:23,420
Why is it not doing it? All right, here we go. Free sample. Hey, I have a free present for you.

206
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:33,109
It's one pack of marijuana. Try it on the house. I have something for you too. I have a one gram

207
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:58,900
pack of amphetamines. Take two. Take two. Share. There we go. Finally. I have to be getting close

208
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,670
to the next level, right? We're making drug addicts. I mean, that's the best point of the game. Hey,

209
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,279
you click the mature content thing. You can be here. I wanted two grams of ecstasy. Okay,

210
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:30,740
put that over there. Okay. Watch out for the police. What did you want? Two grams of amphetamines?

211
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:42,859
Yep. Share. Why do I sound weird? I don't know. I shouldn't. I sound weird? Is that a one guy

212
00:28:42,859 --> 00:29:00,200
scenario? I mean, it failed. I just gave it to him. Oh, I don't sound weird. It's the game.

213
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:15,160
It's the fucking game. The game is playing twice. Right. Because sorry, I turned off my computer and

214
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,859
turned it back on and opened the GoXLR app, which resets my settings every single time I open this

215
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:31,779
program. I don't know why this happens every single time. Just save. Why can't I just save?

216
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:37,700
Do I have to make a full-on new profile? I'm on the dumb-up. Why would I make a new profile

217
00:29:37,700 --> 00:30:01,539
or something? What the fuck? There you go. I will tell you though. I mean, you guys probably know

218
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:08,839
this by now. If there's ever a product that you hear me talk about that I like, get it as fast

219
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:16,730
as you can because that means it's good and it's real and I actually mean it. I'm serious

220
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:24,940
because everything I use, I just go, this sucks. This is stupid. This product is terrible. Do I

221
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:36,279
like anything? Have I been satisfied with any products I've ever purchased? What was the last

222
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:44,069
time I was satisfied fully with a product where I was like, man, I'm McDonald's. Yeah, but okay.

223
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:56,140
Okay, that's true. So go get McDonald's, I guess. That's the only thing that satisfies me.

224
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,049
That's fucking ridiculous. I mean, I can't think of one time where I've been like,

225
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:09,130
oh, McDonald's fucking, McDonald's like sucks. This thing sucks. I haven't said that in a long

226
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:16,259
time. Well, actually, that's not true. McDonald's, it depends on what McDonald's, right? Because they

227
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,480
differ in quality. One McDonald's could be a zero and another McDonald's could be a

228
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,720
six and they both serve the exact same menu. So that's hard to determine. You could go to a

229
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,279
nine out of 10 McDonald's and be like, wow, this is amazing. And then you go to a zero McDonald's

230
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,079
and it's just like they threw together the lettuce and they didn't even fold it correctly.

231
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:44,279
The bun is like soggy and off to the side and fucked up and the thing's cold. It's the same

232
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:55,559
food. That happens. He's a picky eater. What? No, that happens. The soggy lettuce and the

233
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:02,660
bun off to the side. Like, come on. Whenever I open it up and the bun is like wet and off to the side,

234
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:19,019
don't you just go like, oh, I do that. All right, we got to do seven grams of speed. I have it.

235
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:28,230
Here we go. Money. This is going to be a big buy. How close am I to the next stage here?

236
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:37,509
I'm almost at stink. I need 800 respect. Bristol meth is the next thing. Oh boy. When do we get

237
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:44,250
crack? You were one of those mac and cheese and hot dog kids every day, huh?

238
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:58,200
Wow. How wrong could somebody be? It was captain crunch. Get it right. Okay. Let's go. I have

239
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:05,750
any more deals? No, I just need amphetamines. Any more amphetamines? Should I just mix some

240
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:14,890
of this shit together? What did he want? Seven? Shit. Okay. Well, I'm going to have to give this

241
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,410
guy junk. Does this even have amphetamines in it? You know, it's bad when you don't even know

242
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:32,859
if there's even 1% amphetamines in this. The dry rub has it, right? It's getting dry rub.

243
00:33:39,109 --> 00:34:02,809
What's that command? Oh, it's a fart command. How do I stamp a giant like notary stamp on this chat

244
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:10,820
room with minus two right now? How do I do that? Can I do that? Well, you get to do it to me.

245
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:33,400
No, no, I didn't want to change scenes. I wanted to see how you like it. Let's see how you guys

246
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,090
like this. When you look at the screen, this is all I see when I look at the screen.

247
00:34:39,559 --> 00:35:05,829
This is all you see when you look at the screen. It's blurry. Well, sorry. OBS apparently doesn't

248
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:12,860
have vector-based graphics. Maybe I should ring him up and ask him. Well, he knows what

249
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:19,909
vector-based graphics is. I thought he was stupid. I got to rethink everything. $180.

250
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:37,960
Late. I don't want any drugs on me. You wanted the seven. Okay. He's going to hate this, but

251
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:49,320
I'm sorry, dude. Just take the dry rub and whatever. Bye. That's it. Anti-ali. All right.

252
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:57,980
Fine. You learned your lesson. None of you did. None of you did. Not one person did. Okay. 378

253
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:14,699
bucks. I got five points. Where's it going? Ah, fresh coffee. I like coffee, right? I can't do

254
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:30,329
illusion. I need six. I like, I love coffee. I'm going to say either quick learner or I'm doing

255
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:42,010
a quick learner. I want more experience. Yeah. EXP is good. Okay. I have to, now I just have to

256
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:53,539
unlock the new area. I can say the thing. Maybe one day. All right. Let's go back to the house.

257
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:34,500
Sorry. I phone vibrated that to you. Did you get it? I'm going to enhance it.

258
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:40,760
Wait, what did he say there? Check. Zoom in a little.

259
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:58,519
A little more. 10% more. Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. There it is. Yes. I knew it. He's still,

260
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:22,789
he does still love us. Fire. After 10 years. I heard you sell candy. I need four grams. Sure.

261
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:35,400
Delivering soon. That's all I have. I should probably get my, what was in, is there, can I

262
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,670
send this to a lab and find out what was in it? What's in this? I don't know what's in here.

263
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:57,539
I need to get a pill press, but I don't have access to it yet. This was sugar and ecstasy.

264
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:10,219
Just find out. This was ecstasy and dry rub. Why does dry rub have to be in everything? All right.

265
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:21,929
One gram of ecstasy. And then I'm going to, I'm going to do, somebody said that they left the

266
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:25,130
stream last time because they said this is such a bad organization. They refused to watch the

267
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,690
stream. So for that person, I'm going to make, I'm going to change this and make it look a little

268
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:44,550
nicer. All right. Let's get this out. Then I need to do, no, let me do another drug order.

269
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:50,599
I'm going to get a bunch of everything. I'll get a little of everything. I'll get some,

270
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:58,389
I'll get a little bit of, what do I want? Yeah. I want an order. I'll get a little bit of

271
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:05,500
marijuana, a little bit of amphetamines, and yeah, we'll get like 20 grams of marijuana,

272
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:13,800
a little bit of amphetamine, 20 grams of amphetamines, and then like 30 grams of,

273
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:19,750
I don't want too much of that. Why do I feel like I'm ordering off of a Chili's menu?

274
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:31,699
I can buy that, right? 580 bucks. All right. Let's go. Yo, I'm looking for grass. I need two grams.

275
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:45,059
Not yet. It's a subway subway. Yeah. I'll take a, an Italian, an Italian sub please. All right.

276
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:52,739
What do you want for cheese? I'll give me the Swiss, the Swiss triangles. Okay. Any more? Yeah.

277
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:59,429
I'll take some cheddar too. Okay. What kind of vegetables do you want? I'm thinking maybe,

278
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:07,579
maybe some of the kale. Okay. Yeah. Anything else? Maybe some, some of the spinach too.

279
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,260
All right. What drugs do you want? And he moves it down the little line and there's like six tins.

280
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:22,820
There's like fucking amphetamines. They're all crushed up and he sprinkles it in.

281
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:37,510
That's fucking ridiculous. That's a South Park joke. No, I don't want to give him everything.

282
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:51,349
Why? I don't even, I'm not even, because of like a barometer of every show you've ever seen and

283
00:41:51,349 --> 00:42:04,409
everything they've ever said. That would have been funny, but I think I've seen that on Family Guy

284
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:11,989
once. Who even watches that show anymore? No, you can't have any of these. This is for somebody else.

285
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:36,250
Wait, is this for you? No. That's the real stuff too. Stream needs more Tom and Jerry jokes.

286
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,090
All right. I'll be right back. Let me go get a hammer and I'll hit myself in the fucking head

287
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:47,500
with a hammer. That's, is that you sure you want me to do that? Okay. Let me need more Tom and Jerry.

288
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:22,900
Who would be Tom? My left hand and Jerry would be the right. There we go. Oh, I got some new places

289
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:31,110
in my offer. I don't, I can't. All right. Is that, that's two hours from now. Damn. Okay. Speed,

290
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:40,420
grass, ecstasy. I need spray cans. I got to spray paint my tag around. Chat, stop being horny for

291
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,570
five minutes. Um, you know, I've thought, I've thought to say the same thing before,

292
00:43:47,610 --> 00:44:13,269
but it's, they're uncontrollable. This is adults only. They're insane. I can't stop them. It's like,

293
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:18,949
what was his name? Odysseus, whatever his name was, the guy, like the god, the Greek god. And he was

294
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:23,349
like, I have total power. And everyone listened to him for a while. And then like they rose up

295
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:28,139
and fucking took him over and they became like their own gods. No, that was the French revolution.

296
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:40,679
What am I thinking of? Cronos. Yes. That's what I'm saying. Cronos. Cronos thought he had all power

297
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:47,400
and then like he fucking had to like eat his kids or something. Shit got all fucked up.

298
00:44:47,400 --> 00:45:05,000
I just have to sit here. Wait, that was Saturn. Wait, what did Cronos do? Cronos was like the god

299
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,159
of time. No, don't base your knowledge on gods by what you know and what the smite god can do.

300
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:25,530
He's not the god of time. Yeah. Cronos had the ability to rewind time by four seconds.

301
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:30,889
It was arguably the greatest thing he could do. One would call it his ultimate ability.

302
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:59,690
My face. Is it ready? There's the Tom and Jerry joke. No, no, no. I didn't like have a nail

303
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:15,780
hammer into my toe and I didn't go. I guess I just did. Where's my drug drop?

304
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:30,170
Bop it. Tom was the original. No, was it Jerry? Who was the mouse? Tom was the cat. Tom was the

305
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:42,539
original bop it you lose sound. That's right. The face came on or you're an egomaniac. Wouldn't

306
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:55,750
putting the face came on make me an egomaniac? Thinking face. I'm just waiting for my drug

307
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:18,500
delivery. Don't keep it to yourself. Tom scream with the reverb now. Is it ready? Where's the

308
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:25,559
drugs? It's a lot. It's like a six hundred dollar drop. There's like two or three different ones.

309
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:46,179
There's a high one too. Where's that drop? Please. So what do you want me to do? You want me to have

310
00:47:46,179 --> 00:48:12,710
reverb on? You want me to do the bop it sound effect? Do the face cam with it? Now where's

311
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:32,250
the drop? It's in two hours. Do it Jester dance. Dance Jester dance. What the fuck?

312
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:53,190
There it is. Dead drop package. He never had a chance.

313
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,019
All right. Look at this a lot here. Do not get stopped by the police. This is five hundred dollars

314
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:12,469
worth of drugs. I'm going to be in deep shit if somebody stops me. Do it for our entertainment

315
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:36,940
funny man. Funny man. All right I made it. We can rule this city together. Well I don't know

316
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:49,429
about that. Let's break this up into small packages. Let's do the marijuana. Amphetamines.

00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:45,320
noise happens. What's that? Okay that's the scream. What's the tie fighter scream?

320
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:58,380
What is it called? What's the tie fighter scream? Howie howie howie howie howie scream.

321
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:19,590
Sorry. That was pretty close to being that. That was actually better than the howie scream.

322
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:29,659
Besides the long ones just open up when I played Resident Evil 2 and you could over the course of

323
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:34,059
that 12 hours that I've 10 hours that I played that game these would match up somewhere.

324
00:51:56,659 --> 00:52:12,730
Okay not these ones but like that those like this show is fucked up.

325
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:20,170
Like look at this shit. They like fucking murder each other. This is fucking crazy.

00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:45,269
They like beat the absolute shit out of each other. Look at this. Dude that's a bear trap.

327
00:52:46,500 --> 00:53:13,289
Jerry put a bear trap down so when he sat on it it would fucking kill him. Look that's a fucking

328
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:33,829
hammer. Was that a gun? Oh wait it was in the right foot. Oh just burn him with an iron Jerry.

00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:30,460
point blank. Like they would hold a shotgun up to Daffy Duck's face and blow his face off with

01:20:51,850 --> 01:21:01,989
I think they can if they follow you up when they catch you. Stealth and stamina. Stealth and stealth.

446
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:08,939
Yeah they can. Okay that's good to know. How much money do I have now?

448
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:33,300
How do you make money? Am I ever gonna make money? I have to keep paying back way more than I

449
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:46,760
you have to stop giving away free stuff. But yeah but to give away free stuff gets me customers.

450
01:21:48,170 --> 01:22:11,029
Loyal customers. You fucking suck at this. What? I'm just I'm working my ass off here. Dude you

453
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:46,600
I'm gonna sleep. I'm gonna wait on some money and then all right so tell me this.

454
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:54,149

456
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:12,810
10 grams of amphetamine and stretch it to 100. That's kind of what I did last time and people

464
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:51,800

465
01:24:51,800 --> 01:25:00,140
look nice. We're gonna label this shit. By the way I'm gonna do the same shit on the Easy Bake

468
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:26,329
figure out how to do this the right way. All right then we're gonna move the washing powder.

469
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:42,550
Can I even do that? I gotta do this. Okay let's go like this. Pick it up. Oh there's sugar in here.

470
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:52,649
Why the fuck is there sugar in this? Like who cares? That's gonna be junk. Anyways I'm just

471
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:56,619
gonna throw that on the ground okay. I'm just gonna just throw it on the ground.

472
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:05,420
Somebody wants it they can have it. Just take it. This is a medium jar. I'm gonna go right here.

473
01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:16,140
I don't like that. Maybe like this. A little more organized. Big guy's gonna go right here.

474
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:22,100
Small one. I'm gonna have to do this like bowling style because it's not enough.

475
01:26:30,899 --> 01:27:03,609
It has to be perfect. I'm sorry. Okay what is this? Throw it on the ground. Just add it. I don't

476
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:08,890
care. It's dry rub. Who cares? Add it to this. We're gonna mix this up and we're just gonna fucking

477
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:15,800
we're gonna just throw. I don't know where's it gonna dump it. Now let's move this in a better

478
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:24,739
spot like right here. Better. Okay move this over here. There. Oh it's like actually clean now.

479
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:38,060
Now we put our dumb stuff up here. The sugar. The salt. This is washing powder. Salt. Sugar.

480
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:50,409
Salt. Wait what? Why do I have these like restaurant packets for? Marijuana. It's going.

481
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:07,750
Oh shit it's because I have these little packs. I have these little sandwich bags. I'm trying to

482
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm playing solitaire with drugs. This is important. I gotta get. Oh my god this is fucking

483
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:49,609
so stupid. Come here. Just come here. Pick it up. You know I feel like the kid on Halloween

484
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:57,689
that dumps his entire pillowcase full of candy and separates it out and counts it all.

485
01:28:57,689 --> 01:29:03,369
What is this? New sugar mix? Okay this is just junk. It just goes over here. This is just extra.

486
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:11,020
There's 20 of these. Why are there so many of these? Are you fucking kidding me? Wow.

487
01:29:11,899 --> 01:29:18,359
Look at all these. Look at all these Snickers. Give me a fucking break. And that's the amount

488
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:25,029
of Reese's I got? Bunch of fucking assholes this year huh? And the Snickers minis by the way.

489
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:40,659
What a joke. Okay just pick them up. I'm not going to use them for anything.

490
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:49,539
One pack of new new sugar mix mix. Should I just dump it all over here and have like just a bunch

491
01:29:49,539 --> 01:29:56,020
of trash? This is just trash. I'm gonna be cutting my drugs with actual trash from a garbage can.

492
01:29:56,020 --> 01:30:14,279
This is salt. All right is there any more actual drugs that I have? I have fake ecstasy which is

493
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:19,960
this is just cut. Okay I'm gonna get rid of this stuff. I have amphetamines here. There's 10 more

494
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:58,500
packs. Do an 80 20 mix of real to fake. Okay so ecstasy sugar and dry rub. See now I'll make sure

495
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:06,460
nobody touches it. If you guys were concerned of this getting thrown in the ground no one will

496
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:11,020
fucking go near this. People will pick this shit up with tongues. They'll be so scared of it now.

497
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:45,020
Hey you want some silica gel? All right the rest. How do I just burn it? Give the silica

498
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:58,710
gel as a free gift. Dude what's this what's this new shit you just gave me? It's kind of tastes

499
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:22,739
and kind of tastes like new furniture. Yeah it's uh it's good isn't it? I'm gonna die. This is a

500
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:28,710
fucking joke. I kind of want I wish I can I put stuff on the no I can't because it's not a lab.

501
01:32:29,449 --> 01:32:36,329
I can't just make one gram packets just out the door around the whole town and just stand at the

502
01:32:36,329 --> 01:32:50,409
end with my hands in the air. That's unfortunate. Okay so we have uh we have silica gel which

503
01:32:50,970 --> 01:33:04,140
whatever we might use it. Sugar. Sugar. Salt. Washing powder. More salt. This is just salt.

504
01:33:05,739 --> 01:33:15,739
Silica gel. Wait wait wait wait hold on let me make this more realistic.

505
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:23,319
Oh I can't just like put it over in the corner like. How many times have you guys have found a

506
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:35,399
package of silica gel like just somewhere like under a mattress and you're like oh fuck. When

507
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,319
you find like those little like somewhere you just like your life flashes before your eyes you're

508
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:56,260
like holy fuck. Are you winning son? They taste good. You're fucking crazy. You don't do that.

509
01:33:56,899 --> 01:34:06,390
Wait why would you be that scared? Oh I because I have I have a dog. Do you think I'm like walking

510
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:14,979
around on all fours like sniffing around and like eating silica gel on the ground? Wait do

511
01:34:14,979 --> 01:34:19,939
you think I like I mistake the silica gel for the restaurant packet of fucking sweet and low?

512
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:31,899
What the fuck? All right I know I'm like I'm weird but I'm not like

513
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:38,199
that's like that's fucking crazy. What? All right let's make our concoction.

514
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:46,310
We're gonna do ecstasy. We're gonna do five grams of ecstasy. What goes good with ecstasy?

515
01:34:46,869 --> 01:35:00,340
How about sugar? How about silica gel? All right let's do it. No activate the

516
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:14,340
oh I gotta powder it. No I don't want to. I need the pill thing. All right put it back up. Put it

517
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:29,500
back up. Put this back. Bring these down. We'll do we'll do 10 grams. We'll do eight grams and

518
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:45,739
then two grams of something else. Do ecstasy. Okay one more. Then we're gonna cut it with

519
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:53,640
wouldn't washing powder like irritate your nose? Is that what people are doing with this?

520
01:35:56,779 --> 01:36:07,670
Salt would hurt. Silica gel would I mean sugar or baking soda? All right we'll do sugar.

521
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:23,529
Put like two grams in here. All right now I can mill it. Baking soda. I don't think I have any

522
01:36:23,529 --> 01:36:42,520
more baking soda. I mean I have silica gel but that doesn't that's not a good washing powder or

523
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:54,869
no balls. Okay. Silica gel is for storage. Yeah so I should put a baggie of the silica gel in

524
01:36:54,869 --> 01:37:10,819
with like in the just inside the jar. Okay so this is precision. This is poor. It's amphetamine and

525
01:37:10,819 --> 01:37:28,819
sugar. It's poor precision. Why? Should I add washing powder? You need a better cutting table.

526
01:37:29,539 --> 01:37:49,930
Catnip. Well whatever. Why the mix? I spelt it wrong probably. Who cares? No I had it right.

527
01:37:49,930 --> 01:38:07,800
It's diluted. I hate that 9.97. All right package it and I have to remember what this is. This is

528
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:16,890
diluted powder but I need to it's this is amphetamine. I know but fuck I can't.

529
01:38:17,689 --> 01:38:22,439
Okay that's amphetamines. We're gonna add to it. We'll do washing powder this time.

530
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:32,979
We're gonna do a little kick of washing powder. Give me some silica gel. Oh no it's diluted.

531
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:56,729
Just fucking just fucking snort the whole counter. I don't know why that's making me laugh.

532
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:18,760
What the fuck? No I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. All right let's.

533
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:32,600
This is 9.7. 9.97. Let's add some washing powder. I can add three grams of washing powder.

534
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:46,579
Can you really do 350? Can I just dump the whole box? Can I eat like 10 boxes? Can I just cover

535
01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:57,000
my desk with baking soda? How much is it? Oh no 30 grams is the max capacity there.

536
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:06,300
I guess I could just put it in bags and just make a desk out of baking soda. I don't want to spend

537
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:17,930
the time. How's it taking? That would take like an hour. That would take an hour. I can't do it.

538
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:30,039
Okay let's put this over here. It'll mix. It's a little bit. It's infinamine and washing powder.

539
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:47,590
Okay now we're gonna mix it up. Okay well I'm sorry one of my teeth just fell out. I had to

540
01:40:48,310 --> 01:41:11,350
do something about it. Package. Well packets. Okay keep going. My eyes are itchy.

541
01:41:11,909 --> 01:41:18,569
Let me just get itchy eyes for no reason. And then when you itch them it makes them worse.

542
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:26,680
Just way worse. Sometimes I'll slightly itch my eye and I know I'm not supposed to.

543
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:35,239
And then when I start touching my eye it heightens the itchiness by 10,000 percent. And then you're

544
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:41,220
like ha ha ha ha ha ha ha itch itch itch itch itch itch itch. And you can't stop it and it will

545
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:55,909
not go away. I don't tell them. What? Mix the amphetamines with the weed. I don't think I can.

546
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:05,380
Now I have to powder it. Okay what? Oh what uh the sink. I can put these in the sink right? Okay

547
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:21,699
hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna put it in the sink. I'm gonna try this. No bottles. Oh wait uh take

548
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:36,489
one of these bottles. How do I pick it up? I want to pick one of these up. Uh put it in my inventory?

549
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:53,750
Can I not pick this up anymore? Okay you know I could just have to walk away. All right let's

550
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:57,750
fill this drop with water. No bottles found in inventory. What the fuck are you talking about?

551
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:09,529
How do I fill up a bottle? I need a water bottle.

552
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:27,060
What? It's a jar. It's a container. It can hold water. All right so now this is let's mix this up.

553
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:48,970
It's a game. Pretending. I what you can't put water into a jar? I didn't. Sorry I didn't know

554
01:43:48,970 --> 01:44:02,840
that the game didn't want wanted me to get like a bottle of like a water bottle. Okay I have and now

555
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:22,520
I'm the owner of. Let's see uh just throw this in the trash. What do I got? I still don't know why

556
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:27,539
I own this. Okay let's put the silica gel. Let's put this shit out of here so I don't look at it.

557
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:41,619
Okay silica gel. Silica gel. Okay here it is. Diluted. Diluted mix. Put marijuana back.

558
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:51,220
Diluted mix. New new sugar mix. I have 29 of these and then fake x. Okay but I don't have a pill

559
01:44:51,220 --> 01:45:01,829
thing and everyone got mad at me because I did this. Might as well add like 50% salt to it or

560
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:14,149
washing powder. Just mix everything. Guys this is not this is this is dangerous drugs. This is not

561
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:21,829
when you were six and you were making potions in the bathroom. Take two tablespoons of shampoo

562
01:45:21,829 --> 01:45:29,180
and then mouthwash and mix it up with this and then add a little bit of water and then shaving cream.

563
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:34,279
If you didn't do that I don't believe you. This is not what this is. You just you know just make

564
01:45:34,279 --> 01:45:52,659
like a magic potion in your bathroom. This is less dangerous than doing that. No what? Putting like

565
01:45:52,659 --> 01:45:58,739
a little squeeze of toothpaste in a small cup and like a little bit of shaving cream and a little

566
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:06,310
drop of shampoo and mixing it up and saying I'm making magic potions. What's wrong with that?

567
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:19,289
This is less dangerous. Making mustard gas out of my chest.

568
01:46:28,579 --> 01:46:45,000
You could have made no I wouldn't. Wait dude where do I where am I getting this bleach

569
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:51,319
like fucking ammonia? I wasn't allowed to have like aerosol cans guys. What are you talking about?

570
01:46:51,319 --> 01:46:56,680
What do you think my like hey sit down here sir you want to make magic potions? All right

571
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:03,479

572
01:47:04,119 --> 01:47:10,600

573
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:17,220

574
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:27,750

580
01:48:21,289 --> 01:48:29,260

605
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:20,899
you made potions while you took a shit as a teenager you brought your entire desktop

606
01:52:20,899 --> 01:52:25,539

607
01:52:25,539 --> 01:52:38,020
habits are fucked I tell I've told the story plenty of times but it seemed like bringing my

608
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,420
whole computer into the bathroom I would sit there if although there's probably some new viewers

609
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:48,500
I'll just TLDR this whole thing I I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom

610
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:55,210
and a little wobbly table and I would plug everything in and I would set everything up

611
01:52:55,210 --> 01:53:03,079
and I would sit there and take a shit and play video games and it was always such an insanely

612
01:53:03,079 --> 01:53:09,079
awesome idea it was like the greatest thing ever until you were done because then it was just

613
01:53:10,579 --> 01:53:18,729

02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:22,329
them these are pre-recorded subs now that's actually funny if I just do like six of these

806
02:40:22,969 --> 02:40:27,739
and it's just banking fake people don't confuse the fuck out of a lot of people

807
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:44,469
and then there's two people up here level 10 new drug there is new stream that's half pre-recorded

808
02:40:44,469 --> 02:40:52,840
and half live and have chat guests I got crystal meth now that would be really really hard okay

809
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:57,239
if those are that method the detective stream that would be very hard to do

810
02:40:59,219 --> 02:41:06,139
because I would have to be able to take control but there would have to be a video the detective

811
02:41:06,139 --> 02:41:21,659
stream was already just so hard and so many moving parts that was so much fun though if you

812
02:41:21,659 --> 02:41:27,610
this is you might be new to the channel we did a game where I pre-recorded an entire stream

813
02:41:28,629 --> 02:41:33,270
and then I just sat in the chat room with fake accounts and people had to try to find me and

814
02:41:33,270 --> 02:41:40,139
find who I was in the chat and every about five to ten minutes there was a freeze in the video

815
02:41:40,139 --> 02:41:46,260
and people had to pick and vote on who it was and some people got banned that shouldn't have

816
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:58,069
been I was I lasted a pretty long time do another one the thing about that though is that you want

817
02:41:58,069 --> 02:42:02,309
to talk about oh wow what a that's a long stream wow that was a very very elaborate stream that

818
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:09,239
must have taken a lot of effort um it's more so the accounts need to be I need to have accounts

819
02:42:09,239 --> 02:42:14,920
that are like more than three four five six months old subbed to people subbed to random

820
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:19,639
streamers following random fucking people and have activity on the account for like fucking two

821
02:42:19,639 --> 02:42:38,420
years so that's where it gets to be hard what does he want oh I try to try to loot it I will

822
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:48,729
just give you my account no that's your account though I need ecstasy back home I need ecstasy

823
02:42:49,370 --> 02:42:57,940
right now yeah and that somebody just said that also might be actually against terms of service

824
02:42:58,739 --> 02:43:04,280
I don't think they probably wouldn't twitch probably be pretty unhappy with that somehow I

825
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:20,700
would assume just give me your accounts guys real distribution in sector b might get tricky

826
02:43:20,700 --> 02:43:27,260

827

somebody said Reese's paper before it that's what it turns into a lot of time i love salads i love

1084
03:35:28,219 --> 03:35:35,739
romaine lettuce i think like romaine hearts that crunch on a salad on like a nice like a nice sub

1085
03:35:35,739 --> 03:35:38,459
you know if you're not like a nice italian sub you put like a little bit of you know maybe you

1086
03:35:38,459 --> 03:35:53,850
put a tomato on it whatever i love like bruschetta tomato delicious it's designed that way that's

1087
03:35:53,850 --> 03:35:59,049
e coli lettuce well that's what we call slander and um i didn't say it you did

1088
03:35:59,049 --> 03:36:18,860
it this is so loud lettuce lettuce is just like the lettuce is a scam they've the the fucking

1089
03:36:18,860 --> 03:36:28,440
lettuce lettuce the the big the big lettuce has found a way to convince you to eat water

1090
03:36:28,440 --> 03:36:34,760
i'm telling you it spits big lettuce big romaine

1091
03:36:43,290 --> 03:36:48,920
i actually do like lettuce though oh what am i i'm just walking around at night what am i doing

1092
03:36:49,479 --> 03:36:56,950
all right i oh eddie right i gotta pay eddie do a poll no because i know the things i'm saying

1093
03:36:56,950 --> 03:37:01,829
people are like he's fucking crazy i'm gonna take his blood pressure what is it at right now

1094
03:37:01,829 --> 03:37:08,700
is it like 180 over like fucking 160 dude relax it's lettuce i know but i don't i don't like

1095
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:18,649
lettuce on hot food i think it kind of just adds nothing i think lettuce on cold food yes lettuce

1096
03:37:18,649 --> 03:37:33,260
on hot food i don't like it i don't like it that's okay what about on tacos

1097
03:37:36,100 --> 03:37:46,620
okay here's the thing about tacos hold on tacos got him not hold on just give me a second i'm

1098
03:37:46,620 --> 03:37:52,729
about to get fucking arrested for being outside all right hear me out about tacos tacos are an

1099
03:37:52,729 --> 03:37:59,690
interesting thing because the lettuce in a taco does not get hot like it does when you put it in

1100
03:37:59,690 --> 03:38:07,450
between bread and in a hamburger that's hot off the grill lettuce sits protected on top of two

1101
03:38:07,450 --> 03:38:12,969
or three different ingredients meats at the bottom and it's very bottom on top of that you've got

1102
03:38:12,969 --> 03:38:17,930
potentially fucking sauce cheese cold cheese by the way on top of that you've got potentially

1103
03:38:17,930 --> 03:38:21,690
like salsa and then on top of that you got lettuce lettuce never touches anything hot

1104
03:38:21,690 --> 03:38:26,489
the lettuce never comes into contact with any of the hot food putting the lettuce down on the

1105
03:38:26,489 --> 03:38:33,540
burger boom you've compromised it just i'm just telling you the things that i think

1106
03:38:38,229 --> 03:38:39,190
what about the tortilla

1107
03:38:45,989 --> 03:38:54,120
somebody wrote in all caps someone institutionalize him what the fuck it's not the same thing

1108
03:38:54,120 --> 03:39:01,559
because there's no top part of listen when you have a hamburger you are closing it up so the

1109
03:39:01,559 --> 03:39:09,639
heat gets like trapped in between the buns a taco is open at the top there is no top to a taco

1110
03:39:09,639 --> 03:39:15,879
you don't close the taco and have the meat heat up the lettuce so it gets hot and soggy and shit

1111
03:39:19,879 --> 03:39:20,840
lock this guy up

1112
03:39:26,100 --> 03:39:33,909
who puts salsa on a burger i'm talking about putting salsa on a taco by the way a salsa on a

1113
03:39:33,909 --> 03:39:37,909
burger this i'm sure there's some that exists where like you could put something like i don't

1114
03:39:37,909 --> 03:39:48,059
know there's probably different like creations and you'll be hearing from my lawyers i like putting

1115
03:39:48,059 --> 03:39:52,299
shit on burgers you know i i like putting interest i like that would probably be kind of good

1116
03:39:55,459 --> 03:39:58,739
no wouldn't oh i don't like to like what to me i'm saying no what stuff

1117
03:40:02,629 --> 03:40:05,750
and by the way can we get over this like put mac and cheese on everything

1118
03:40:07,540 --> 03:40:15,079
can we get over this i i don't understand it put mac and cheese on your hamburger put mac and cheese

1119
03:40:15,079 --> 03:40:33,209
on your pizza put mac and cheese on your lobster i'm over it lobster mac is so good i know but

1120
03:40:33,209 --> 03:40:42,629
like crab is better than lobster why is there no crab mac and cheese why is it always lobster mac

1121
03:40:42,629 --> 03:40:46,229
and cheese how come there's no crab why they don't like the crab so much crab is better than lobster

1122
03:40:49,100 --> 03:40:57,340
king crab is better than the best lobster i've ever had crab is just it just better than lobster

1123
03:40:57,340 --> 03:41:02,420
i'm sorry and this is coming from somebody from new england me saying that crab is better than

1267
04:07:51,290 --> 04:07:57,899
gets a computer and they can just literally have every single thing that's ever been known

1268
04:07:57,899 --> 04:08:04,200
and they can pretend like they knew it it's actually a great position to be in because

1269
04:08:04,200 --> 04:08:11,159
when i don't know the square root of eight people can go it's it's 60 it's 35 idiot because they

1270
04:08:11,159 --> 04:08:17,110
just typed it into the other fucking other monitor and if i do that people know and they call me out

1271
04:08:17,110 --> 04:08:25,860
on cheating and that i don't know so you have all the power in that regard so i would say a 10 uh jp

1280
04:09:31,290 --> 04:09:35,370
trillo thanks for the 500 bits of all the bad games you've played which would you least like

1281
04:09:35,370 --> 04:09:52,790
to play again um of all the well what is it what constitutes a bad game a game that i didn't like

1282
04:09:52,790 --> 04:10:12,600
or a game that was truly awful like a four to ten or something one that you didn't like uh i mean i

1283
04:10:12,600 --> 04:10:16,440
probably wouldn't play any of the bad games i've played again so that's this kind of hard decision

1284
04:10:16,440 --> 04:10:29,500
to make uh i mean i i the thing i mean i i beat the thing i don't have any reason to play the

1285
04:10:29,500 --> 04:10:34,629
thing ever again i beat the whole game the evil within yeah but the evil within is not considered

1286
04:10:34,629 --> 04:10:41,370
a bad game i just didn't like it um probably odama there's no reason why i would play that

1287
04:10:41,370 --> 04:10:48,899
again it was just it was horrendous to me there's no reason for me to go back and play that again

1288
04:10:50,340 --> 04:10:57,350
for what reason would i ever do it i could somehow in some stupid weird world find a way maybe where

1289
04:10:57,350 --> 04:11:09,030
i could play the evil within but i would never play odama again so yeah uh phalanx ultron thanks

1386
04:27:07,350 --> 04:27:10,870
mcdlt is some of the dumbest shit i've ever seen also grilling burgers is the boomer dad way of

1387
04:27:10,870 --> 04:27:18,760
making a burger they're always dry and taste like ass i i can't i cannot imagine that's a real

1388
04:27:18,760 --> 04:27:25,959
comment i can't imagine that's a real comment i don't i i don't know i think that that's gotta

1389
04:27:25,959 --> 04:27:34,700
be like a like a fucking laugh out loud yellow bell moment i think a burger on the grill is

1390
04:27:34,700 --> 04:27:42,200
with like a good charcoal i'm not sure this you know what else listen to me guys burger on the

1391
04:27:42,200 --> 04:27:47,479
grill that's great i know like burger on the grill that's like level one of like the fucking super

1392
04:27:47,799 --> 04:27:57,610
intelligence meme thing right right at the very end corn corn on the cob slather it in a garlic

1393
04:27:57,610 --> 04:28:08,389
butter and just grill it right on the grate grilling is the best like grilling's the best

1394
04:28:09,030 --> 04:28:15,030
it's like one of my favorite things i can't believe you just said that it was a the boomer

1395
04:28:15,030 --> 04:28:20,379
way to make food well how do you make a burger you put it in like a pan i mean yeah i put it in the

1396
04:28:20,459 --> 04:28:26,629
pan i guess but if you have access to a grill it's just exponentially more flavors there's so much

1397
04:28:26,629 --> 04:28:34,790
more going on now i would i will give you this grilling's a pain in the ass because if you have

1398
04:28:34,790 --> 04:28:42,489
a charcoal grill you have to preheat the grill you've got to put the coals in you've got to heat

1399
04:28:42,489 --> 04:28:49,829
the coals up dump them in there it's dangerous i get it but it's way better i mean that is that

1400
04:28:49,829 --> 04:28:57,079
just my opinion i think i don't know i think it is yeah it takes a while it takes like 20 minutes

1401
04:28:57,079 --> 04:29:01,799
to heat up coals and then it takes a long time for the grill to heat up it's a process but you

1402
04:29:01,799 --> 04:29:08,120
do it you hang out you make the you get the you get some party hats and get a couple of

1403
04:29:08,120 --> 04:29:17,290
seats just hang out outside get the grill going make some birds and dogs man get some corn on

1404
04:29:17,290 --> 04:29:30,440
there right on the grate garlic butter just hang out i said birds birds and dogs not birds although

1405
04:29:30,440 --> 04:29:40,069
you could put you could put chicken on there if you wanted to i'm sorry i disagree i don't know

1406
04:29:40,069 --> 04:29:45,430
where you get the idea that burgers on the grill are bad you know that burgers on the grill are

1407
04:29:45,430 --> 04:29:53,459
good when an entire chain pretends that they do it that way burger king's whole ad campaign

1408
04:29:53,459 --> 04:30:08,069
is about pretending to grill their hamburgers flame broiled flame grilled grill grill marks

1409
04:30:08,629 --> 04:30:19,860
flame you don't get you don't get a fire in a microwave you don't get a fire in an oven

1410
04:30:20,420 --> 04:30:34,420
just doesn't happen and if it does you get a big problem moving on ike turtle thanks to the 250

1411
04:30:34,420 --> 04:30:38,180
hey lettuce hater you probably let your burgers sit up for like three hours before you eat them

1412
04:30:38,180 --> 04:30:43,219
because your weak teeth can't handle fresh lettuce i made this hamburger today and i put lettuce on

1413
04:30:43,219 --> 04:30:48,969
it because i have strong teeth lettuce lads and it's a deleted link anybody have it anybody get

1414
04:30:48,969 --> 04:30:59,590
the link stripes beast thanks for 250 germa i swear to god the perfect burger you described

1415
04:31:00,229 --> 04:31:09,340
is the buttery jack from jack in the box your perfect burger is like five bucks no it's a

1416
04:31:09,340 --> 04:31:15,340
mushroom and onion swiss bro no it's you that's not even accurate that's like saying your favorite

1417
04:31:15,340 --> 04:31:22,489
okay so mcdonald's has a fucking bacon cheeseburger is my favorite burger going to be from mcdonald's

1418
04:31:22,489 --> 04:31:28,520
the baconator from fucking wendy's or whatever oh yeah that's right no there's a version of it

1419
04:31:28,520 --> 04:31:35,430
that exists it's like a popular way to make a hamburger if you make your own baconator it's

1420
04:31:35,430 --> 04:31:43,299
going to be way better than if you get it from burger king it's just it's a difference see no

1421
04:31:43,299 --> 04:31:52,040
it's not what do you mean no it's not it's wait if you order a baconator from wendy's and you

1422
04:31:52,040 --> 04:31:57,559
make your own baconator on the grill are you trying to tell me that you that they're the same

1423
04:31:58,280 --> 04:32:08,309
oh i have no no no way what who is saying this there's nobody in this chat actually saying this

1424
04:32:08,309 --> 04:32:21,020
if you guys have a made bacon on a grill you can do bacon on the grill it's and it's i don't know

1425
04:32:21,020 --> 04:32:27,510
how to do anything i don't know how to cook at all cooking on the grill is awesome because it's just

1426
04:32:27,510 --> 04:32:41,540
the caveman fire fucking way to cook hot is hot fire food burn flip done you don't need no shit

1427
04:32:43,500 --> 04:32:50,549
smell good take off fire eat you don't need to oh well first get a little bit put some oil

1428
04:32:50,549 --> 04:32:54,629
and then add a put a marinade on that and then slip it down over here and then get the

1429
04:32:54,629 --> 04:32:59,989
and make sure you put delicately put it into the oven for 15 fucking minutes at 425 degrees

1430
04:32:59,989 --> 04:33:08,759
take it out put it back in the pan no no no fire burn meat yes you don't have to know shit

1431
04:33:08,759 --> 04:33:21,080
it's the best way to cook because it's like you can't really screw it up you can put like

1432
04:33:21,080 --> 04:33:24,840
literally anything you want and like here's how you tell if something's done on the grill

1433
04:33:29,509 --> 04:33:44,810
take it off you eat it you can burn it yeah but you don't it's it's it's all you follow

1434
04:33:44,810 --> 04:33:57,080
the directions you're fine he knows how to cook he's just lazy grilling no lazy grilling takes

1435
04:33:57,080 --> 04:34:02,840
so much prep work it's unbelievable it takes like exponentially like three times more prep

1436
04:34:02,840 --> 04:34:08,860
to get a grill going than just to turn the burner on your stove on it's not the lazy way it's the

1437
04:34:08,860 --> 04:34:16,569
no no it's the exceptionally lazy way because it takes a ton of work to get it going and then

1438
04:34:16,569 --> 04:34:24,919
you just sit there while your food just sits on a grill you don't have to do shit you don't use

1439
04:34:24,919 --> 04:34:32,380
propane i really don't want to start an argument here about how like hardwood versus propane like

1440
04:34:32,380 --> 04:34:39,720
wood fire and coals i really don't want to start an argument here but i could about hardwood and

1441
04:34:39,720 --> 04:34:49,479
wood grilling and coal grilling versus gas and propane grilling i could start a fight here there

1442
04:34:49,479 --> 04:34:58,459
ain't nothing in this world there are a few things that really get me going and that can

1443
04:34:58,459 --> 04:35:08,310
never be compared to and one of them is the sound smell and sight of hot coals at the bottom of a

1444
04:35:08,310 --> 04:35:18,200
grill when you when they dump in there and they make that like and the smell it's just that hard

1445
04:35:19,000 --> 04:35:25,819
and the sight that just you see the fire you see the the red the orange hot heat

1446
04:35:26,380 --> 04:35:32,099
fire get that grill back on and you can you get that just ain't and they ain't much like it

1447
04:35:32,099 --> 04:35:42,549
this is boomer talk no it's not come on no way it's like a hot this is the boomer talk

1448
04:35:45,830 --> 04:35:51,740
hot coals are just so such a sure it is boomer talk you know why because people were cooking

1449
04:35:51,740 --> 04:35:57,500
with like this for a fucking hundreds of years they didn't have a button they turned on and

1450
04:35:57,500 --> 04:36:03,900
this is you want to call me a boomer this is like super boomer this is like fucking caveman boomer

1451
04:36:03,900 --> 04:36:09,500
okay they used to cook on rocks guys and it just it's something about it is there's so much

1452
04:36:09,500 --> 04:36:17,209
interesting history with like grilling over hot wood it's it brings you back to the fucking 1700s

1453
04:36:17,209 --> 04:36:30,740
when christopher columbus made the first weber grill they had stoves go back even further go back

1454
04:36:30,740 --> 04:36:38,409
to go back to go back to the 1200s they used to cook on rocks on the ground coals hot charcoal

1455
04:36:38,409 --> 04:36:50,700
carbon they also had stoves in the 1200s go back even further go back to go to 680 the smell the

1456
04:36:50,779 --> 04:37:00,009
air was so clean fresh hunting they would and the coals hot still stoves in six when did they not

1457
04:37:00,009 --> 04:37:10,259
have stoves when did humans not have stoves when did they cook on rocks when was it it was like bc

1458
04:37:10,259 --> 04:37:22,540
we've always had stoves no we have not before but wait you're telling me that you told me bc before

1459
04:37:22,540 --> 04:37:31,750
christ like jesus was using a stove that's kind of a weird image isn't it like can you got you

1460
04:37:31,990 --> 04:37:38,700
can you picture jesus like cooking macaroni on a stove that's like kind of weird right he's like i

1461
04:37:38,700 --> 04:37:42,380
i think about like the magical things that i've written about him and he's like just sitting there

1462
04:37:42,380 --> 04:37:50,599
stirring like food like stirring like fucking macaroni and cheese macaroni wasn't invented yet

1463
04:37:51,340 --> 04:37:57,619
go back then no go forward and then go back go forward to get a box of mac and cheese and go

1464
04:37:57,619 --> 04:38:04,860
back to fucking 2 ad and get it on those hot coals the point still stands there ain't nothing like

1465
04:38:04,860 --> 04:38:12,860
hot fucking rocks and wood that's cooking your food and the best part the smell doesn't leave

1466
04:38:12,860 --> 04:38:20,380
your body for two weeks you will run your fingers through your hair and you will just be like why

1467
04:38:20,380 --> 04:38:26,630
does it smell like an ashtray in my hand ah but it's a good ashtray it's like a hardwood it's a

1468
04:38:26,630 --> 04:38:42,229
carbon it's a heat it's a it's it's a strong hot smell okay moving on it's a strong hot ashtray

1469
04:38:42,229 --> 04:38:50,279
just nuke your food in the microwave we already went over the fact that that can you cook a full

1470
04:38:50,279 --> 04:38:59,959
turkey in the microwave every time it makes me laugh how long do we even come to a determination

1471
04:38:59,959 --> 04:39:05,880
how long what would the time be like 70 minutes like 60 minutes in the microwave

1472
04:39:10,229 --> 04:39:14,950
i know the mr bean thing but but seriously like how what would it actually do at like low power

1473
04:39:16,459 --> 04:39:30,889
one minute on max probably 40 minutes at like two out of 10 would it explode

1474
04:39:33,220 --> 04:39:38,700
not at minimum power right it would be seven to nine minutes per pound

1475
04:39:39,419 --> 04:39:42,380
so you're talking about like more than an hour at low power in the microwave

1476
04:39:43,340 --> 04:39:57,189
it would be cold inside it would just be raw it would just be steam it

1477
04:39:58,340 --> 04:40:08,409
can you steam a turkey how would you steam a turkey you can steam a turkey

1478
04:40:10,650 --> 04:40:19,540
easy makeup and turkey a boiled turkey oh my god oh that's that does not sound good

1572
04:53:07,209 --> 04:53:14,900
know maybe how it happened but i don't know a thousand percent i don't know and i don't i

1573
04:53:14,900 --> 04:53:20,020
don't want to talk about medical stuff i do sometimes unless i kind of know what i'm saying

1574
04:53:20,020 --> 04:53:23,380
and if i'm saying is true i don't want to be like well guys this is the thing that i have

1575
04:53:24,180 --> 04:53:35,369
i don't want to do that i'd rather just do it and see what happens it has nothing to do with an

1576
04:53:35,369 --> 04:53:48,259
injury i will tell you it's not an injury thing i will maybe have some more info hopefully if

1588
04:54:57,139 --> 04:55:06,840
kind of earth shaking things i'm really sorry to hear that but thanks for the 250 and stay safe i

1589
04:55:06,840 --> 04:55:15,959
wish you and your family the best we are almost at the end of the bits here we had 500 bits from

1590
04:55:16,599 --> 04:55:22,740
thank you bat mom 250 from rosy briar get well soon germa i'm doing all right i'm doing just fine

1591
04:55:23,619 --> 04:55:31,849
i'm good thank you appreciate the concern thanks for five dollars and 64 cents pond of this streamer

1592
04:55:31,849 --> 04:55:39,099
a burger with the meat marinated not dipped in barbecue sauce and a fried egg uh i'm gonna i

1593
04:55:39,099 --> 04:55:46,200
have to stop you right there i'm sorry i have to stop you there i don't like egg i don't like egg

1594
04:55:46,200 --> 04:55:53,779
on my meat uh i don't like the no i'm sorry i'm not an egg i'm not a fried egg on burger guy i

1595
04:55:53,779 --> 04:56:02,229
know people love it but it's a it's a textural thing for me because when you bite into the egg

1596
04:56:02,229 --> 04:56:07,430
and if the egg starts to run and then all you got a problem with the egg running and it's runny egg

1597
04:56:07,430 --> 04:56:14,650
in your burger i know people love it and it's a huge kim loves that shit she's a huge fan of that

1598
04:56:14,650 --> 04:56:22,090
but i'm i'm not really that big of an egg guy either i like hard-boiled eggs i don't like runny

1599
04:56:22,090 --> 04:56:33,529
eggs i think that's my problem i like a a jammy egg but most places that do egg on a burger

1600
04:56:34,389 --> 04:56:39,909
it's deliberately in my opinion and not even my opinion it's actually deliberately well make

1601
04:56:39,909 --> 04:56:46,150
sure it's a big runny egg bite into it and get the fucking egg all over you it's like deliberate

1602
04:56:46,150 --> 04:56:51,990
they do it on purpose that's what that's every restaurant i've ever been to doesn't like that

1603
04:56:52,549 --> 04:57:00,069
but i'm maybe i would like it if it was a jammy kind of old medium over medium egg rather than

1604
04:57:00,630 --> 04:57:06,279
over easy maybe i would like it but i just don't like the runny egg it's a textural thing

1605
04:57:07,290 --> 04:57:12,419
also you ever considered playing metro exodus it can be finished in three streams yeah i thought

1606
04:57:12,419 --> 04:57:18,979
about it i played i beat metro 2033 on stream and then i had a meltdown in the first 30 minutes of

1607
04:57:18,979 --> 04:57:25,880
last light and vowed to never play the whole series ever again for some reason i don't i have

1608
04:57:25,880 --> 04:57:31,639
no idea and it was like it's kind of like the halo scenario where i had such like a bad stream

1609
04:57:31,639 --> 04:57:37,779
kind of moment that like the game is now fucking ruined because like the stream i was like so

1610
04:57:37,779 --> 04:57:43,299
fucked up and so like annoyed or i couldn't like do the first mission or something and now like

1611
04:57:43,299 --> 04:57:53,979
the game is ruined for me it's weird how that works he's just traumatized but maybe when maybe

1612
04:57:53,979 --> 04:58:02,599
eventually i don't know i'd have to play last light first because 2033 was good it was a lot

1613
04:58:02,599 --> 04:58:09,509
of fun and i beat it i'm assuming i would like the next one i just had a huge issue for some

1614
04:58:09,509 --> 04:58:15,270
reason that day a bulbous whack thanks for the five dollars russian car driver is the best worst game

1615
04:58:15,270 --> 04:58:20,220
i've ever played full of awful translations and poorly designed ui i would recommend it

1616
04:58:21,110 --> 04:58:31,619
russian car driver never heard of it hey adison thanks for the three dollars hey germa i've been

1617
04:58:31,619 --> 04:58:36,500
loving listening to your streams while playing animal crossing lately have you played anymore

1618
04:58:36,500 --> 04:58:42,650
with kim actually no i have not i've not played any animal crossing it hasn't really been a whole

1619
04:58:42,650 --> 04:58:49,380
lot of time just recently have kim and i really started to settle and there hasn't been some

1620
04:58:49,380 --> 04:58:57,799
something crazy that needs to be set up or done or uh so maybe now that these last like a few days

1621
04:58:58,360 --> 04:59:05,020
but now i haven't played it the villagers all moved oh does that happen oh well i'll get new

watch ghost busters one and two watch gremlins two especially if you haven't seen gremlins one

1627
04:59:42,709 --> 04:59:54,619
and two watch them today um i would say gremlins is a pretty underrated series uh curvy enthusiasm

1628
04:59:54,619 --> 05:00:00,540
is pretty is a pretty highly rated series a lot of people know about that underrated ghost busters

1629
05:00:05,299 --> 05:00:14,729
not a movie well they said movies and games i'm doing the movies part first games i mean the

1630
05:00:14,729 --> 05:00:21,349
easiest one to say is sorcery i think that's the criminally most underrated experience although

1631
05:00:21,349 --> 05:00:27,659
it can be kind of frustrating if you if you weren't around years ago sorcery is it's probably

1632
05:00:27,659 --> 05:00:39,259
the most underrated experience for a game herb your enthusiasm is my favorite soulsborne game um

1633
05:00:40,389 --> 05:00:50,220
i don't know besides that i don't know other games that are underrated that i play or liked

1634
05:00:51,340 --> 05:00:56,680
i've played so many games it's like hard to keep track sometimes there are games that i forgot

1635
05:00:56,680 --> 05:01:01,240

1649
05:02:54,439 --> 05:03:06,069
if the answer is yes you yeah you do am i going to get in trouble well that all depends um that

1650
05:03:06,069 --> 05:03:18,919
all depends if you claim your car as a dependent i would recommend against not doing that uh but

1651
05:03:18,919 --> 05:03:24,279
you should file taxes i would recommend getting in touch with a certified public accountant a cpa

1652
05:03:25,159 --> 05:03:29,159
or if you're worried about potentially wait i had a bunch of money that i didn't pay taxes on to get

1653
05:03:29,159 --> 05:03:51,779
a cpa and help you out with it just use turbo tax yeah yeah but if you don't people you can make

1654
05:03:51,779 --> 05:04:05,180
mistakes on turbo tax you be careful some people can potentially make mistakes on there just don't

1655
05:04:05,180 --> 05:04:16,680
make mistakes yeah but if you had income last year i yes i highly advise you filing a return

1656
05:04:17,319 --> 05:04:22,919
although hey i will tell you uh the date to file a return has been extended in the united states

1657

1693
05:09:50,700 --> 05:09:57,860
300 bits hey germ just a heads up that the source codes for tf2 and cs go have been leaked so if

1694
05:09:57,860 --> 05:10:03,500
you play them you could get a virus what but how does it how does it make any sense what

1695
05:10:04,220 --> 05:10:09,130
the source code for tf2 is leaked if you play tf2 you'll get a virus

1696
05:10:09,930 --> 05:10:22,069
i don't get it but so somebody just will make their own tf2 and that wouldn't that mean that

1697
05:10:22,069 --> 05:10:29,459
like somebody has to make their own tf2 and inject it with something bad how would they

1698
05:10:32,569 --> 05:10:47,740
know people are finding ways people are finding out a way to remote code execute oh valve said

1699
05:10:47,740 --> 05:10:58,040
you don't need to worry about it well let's hope that's not a problem that sounds kind of insane

1700
05:10:58,759 --> 05:11:04,819
source code is almost two years old and valve themselves they said there's no cause for alarm

1701
05:11:04,819 --> 05:11:14,279
at this point oh well somebody fuck somebody get fucking norton on it somebody somebody called

1702
05:11:14,279 --> 05:11:25,990

1708
05:12:05,029 --> 05:12:09,029

1709
05:12:09,029 --> 05:12:17,880

1712
05:12:36,279 --> 05:12:42,360
a lot here and but i never want to get to a point where i'm kind of i've it's been like this for a

1713
05:12:42,360 --> 05:12:51,689
decade i don't i want it to be fun and i want it to be just something that i like to do and when

1752
05:17:49,610 --> 05:17:58,569
have done but these characters like the soldier it's it'll stay that the just how fun and funny

1753
05:17:58,569 --> 05:18:06,900
and interesting the soldier was it'll stay with me forever i think a lot of you too just the timing

1754
05:18:06,900 --> 05:18:13,369
and the delivery that a lot of those guys had was just they were having so much fun and you could

1755
05:18:13,369 --> 05:18:18,009
tell you could tell that when tf2 was first released and they started doing the meet the team

1756
05:18:18,009 --> 05:18:24,659
videos those guys were having a fucking blast the dev the devs were having a blast the players are

1757
05:18:24,659 --> 05:18:30,259
having a blast the actors were having a ton of fun it was so much fun shit everybody was having

1758
05:18:30,259 --> 05:18:36,790
such a great time it'll stay with me forever like some of those lines will stay with me forever

1759
05:18:36,790 --> 05:18:54,250
