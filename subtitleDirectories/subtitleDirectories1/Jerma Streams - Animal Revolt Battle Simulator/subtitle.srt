00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:10,250
Hey, very dark in here. I know. Play with chopsticks for an hour? I'm not gonna do that.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,449
I want to make sure this is not loud. Let's turn it down for you because I don't blow your ears out.

3
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:22,870
Okay, I have to install it. Okay, the bitrate's gonna drop like a shitload because it's gonna

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:39,479
take over all my internet, so I don't have it downloaded. Okay. Revolt? Animal Revolt Battle

5
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:46,549
Simulator. Is this gonna be funny? I don't know, we'll find out. I'm gonna get it. Well, I already

6
00:00:46,549 --> 00:01:00,070
have it. That's a lie. Use coconut oil? Alright, internet's gonna go- the stream's gonna like die

7
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:14,840
for a second. Alright, done. Downloaded. Yeah, that was literally- do you understand the power

8
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,549
of fiber optics? That was- that was a 1.1 gigabyte game and it downloaded in three seconds.

9
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,879
Just the power of fucking absolute gigabyte. Alright, let's go. I need to update the title

10
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:39,379
too because the title makes no sense. What's this game called? Animal Revolt Battle Simulator. Okay.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,459
Loud. Good thing I turned it down. Alright, yeah. Early access. Wait, you can do dinosaurs versus

12
00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:20,979
like- hold on a minute. This might be cool. This could be pretty cool. Why can't- I can't

13
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:30,969
capture the game for some reason. Come on, capture the game. It's right here. Capture.

14
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:51,289
Psycho energy? Yeah. Let me try capturing it again. Oh, there it is. Alright, good. Alright,

15
00:02:51,289 --> 00:03:02,870

00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,149
all those fine looking men by holding the left mouse button. Drag. Okay. This is a good RTS.

40
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,009
One man will struggle to move past a heavy wood plank, but together they should be able to make

41
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:49,399
their way to the flag. Can I get a better view? Alright. I got it. It's Warcraft 3. All those

poor dinosaurs are blind and immobile. Select all your archers and right click on the dinosaurs

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:14,490

44
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:38,300
you fight. I want to zoom in. Okay. Cool. How do I move the camera? Q-W-E-A-S-M-D to move the camera

45
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:53,160
around. Alright. Camera rotation. Oh shit. Alright. I get it. Tab rotates. There's a cute little pig

46
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:05,720
hiding around here somewhere. Where is it? Where are you? Inside of one of these things?

47
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Last. Really? Okay. God damn it. Alright. Pig in there. Got it.

48
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:43,509
Instruct your rocket man to destroy it. That's kind of sad. Why? Okay. I don't like this.

49
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:56,360
Okay. Create animals with a budget of a thousand dollars and an animal count of 25. Okay.

50
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:32,950
Animals. Ancient humans. About, uh, a knight? Okay. That was kind of unfair. That was really

51
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:47,539
unfair. Okay. This white character is your FPS avatar. Left mouse click on it and press F to

52
00:09:47,539 --> 00:10:13,129
take control. What? Are you serious? Why can I do this? Okay. That's actually pretty cool.

53
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:41,340
That's funny. Defoe letter grade? Almost. There's a car. You got it. Okay. Reach the goal. Okay.

54
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:51,669
Almost done. Take control of FPS. I can reach one of them. You can destroy the tower with a grenade

55
00:10:51,669 --> 00:11:09,429
launcher. Whoa. Are you serious? I actually get to use this stuff? Alright. I got it. It's tabs,

56
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:18,980
but FPS. Mom, I want to play tabs. We have tabs at home. Alright. Stop. Take control of the FPS

57
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:30,889
avatar and then go to the enemy spawner to disable it. Okay. Let's go. Let's move. Wait. Why are the

58
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:50,169
enemies pigs? Alright. Destroy the enemy spawner. How do I destroy the spawner? I feel like I'm

59
00:11:50,169 --> 00:12:05,450
playing Dusk. Alright. Tutorial is almost over and then I can play. Final tutorial.

60
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:13,179
This poor little hippo has no chance against a bunch of angry humans with baseball bats. Attach

61
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:37,460
some weapons to the hippo. Missile launcher? Okay. Oh, a limit one. Shit. Okay. Well, that's fine.

62
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:58,919
Okay. Why does it not hurt the hippo? Okay. This game actually can be really fun. Alright. Tutorial

63
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:15,350
done. Let's go. Human salvation. Okay. This is humans. Remember that you can control the movement

64
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,059
of your units using your mouse. Alright. So I have to be, I have to win. What do you got? You've got

65
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:29,559
people with axes and shields and shit. Okay. Ancient humans. I'm going to go with Archie the

66
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:37,879
archer. It's 10 bucks. I'm going to put concentrated in one spot so that it's like one

67
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,789
giant arrow landing down on their heads. I'm going to put them in what I call a bowling formation.

68
00:13:44,789 --> 00:14:03,879
This should be good. Okay. Bowling formation done. Any pins? Alright. I think we're ready.

69
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:19,639
Start. Oh, they have shields. This didn't work the way that I thought it was going to work.

70
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:45,879
Absolutely obliterated. Is there anybody left? You guys suck. Use the RTS commands. Wait, I can?

71
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:55,139
Oh shit. I can. Alright. Did I win? I almost won. Oh god damn it. Okay. I forgot about that.

72
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:00,659
Let us gamble. That's not a bad idea. But let me get the swing of the things first.

73
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:08,279
Let me get the swing of things first before you lose all your money. How much am I? 15?

74
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:22,870
Cost them a 250. Alright. Alright. Okay. Okay. This one will work. I'm going to control these

75
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:31,299
guys. Alright. Here we go. And three. Don't get, what a bad camera angle. Alright. Lock it in.

76
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:45,529
Start. Shoot that one person. Good. That's guy right here. Good. This guy right here.

77
00:15:46,090 --> 00:16:03,639
Again. In the head. Again. Okay. Good. Again. Again. Nice job. Alright. Round two is these

78
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:11,460
animals. I can't wait to make my own shit. This is going to be awesome. I'm going to do a dinosaur

79
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,679
fight like you've never seen before. Alright. It's versus, how many of us, what is it? Elephants,

80
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:26,490
hippos, giraffes. I kind of feel like the night would be well good here. Or just a shitload of

81
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:59,740
these guys with the axes. 400 limit. Or just like 40 archers. Okay. Let's see what happens.

82
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:14,490
And three. Two. One. Go. Okay. Shoot. That way. Wait. What? Alright. Stop breaking up formation.

83
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:26,680
Get over here. How the fuck are you supposed to do this? This is impossible for humans to beat this.

84
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:45,910
This is actually impossible. Can I do weapons? Alright. I'm going to scatter around. We're going

85
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:58,299
to do the knights. We'll do like, okay, knights. One. Two. Like some over here. We'll do some

86
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:12,410
Spartan warriors over here. Right at the front. Okay. Archers are going to go back here. And then

87
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,140
I'm going to get some of these guys just to be right here. Just to get attacked. Okay. Let's try

88
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:49,259
that. It's kind of working. Fucking hippo. What happened to the hippo? This is so stupid. Okay.

89
00:18:49,259 --> 00:19:04,420
That was dumb. But I got it. This one is aliens. Why did I say that so weird? Aliens? Bugs. Alright.

90
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:24,329
We're just going to load up a shitload of these. Watch out for these mutants. The mutant like

91
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:46,230
sucker things. Get them. Mom, we have tabs at home. I like this. This is cool. I think we're

92
00:19:46,230 --> 00:20:07,269
going to do a phalanx or riot. Alright. I'll do a phalanx. There are dinosaurs. Alright. You know

93
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:26,220
what? You know what? I'm ready. I'm ready. Where should we go? Is it just green? Just small green.

94
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:36,359
Grassland. Time of day. It's going to be noon. Looks good. Victory condition is death match.

95
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:51,509
Uh, player army limits. Holy shit, dude. That's a lot. Pathfinding. Animals will move in a straight

96
00:20:51,509 --> 00:21:06,069
line. Yeah, we'll do gambling. You guys can gamble on these. Wind effect. Amuro. Animal weapons and

97
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:17,579
armor. Alright. Alright. Let's go for it. This is the battle. Okay. Animal base. Holy shit, dude.

98
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:35,619
This just got so much more interesting. Alright. Unicreator. Let's do animal base. How about a

99
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:43,819
modern mammal? Alright. A rhinosaur. A rhinosaur body. What side are they on, by the way? Team one.

100
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:55,160
Okay. I want, I want it to be big. How do I make it big? AI mode. Detection distance multiplier. How

101
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:19,740
do I make it bigger? Can I make this thing bigger? Can I scale it up? How do I make it bigger?

102
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:32,539
Robotic base. Okay. A head. Wheel. It's the wheel. Wheel for scale. It doesn't work. Wheel? Wheel

103
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:49,690
just spins. Alt scroll wheel for scale. There we go. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Wonderful. Okay.

104
00:22:49,690 --> 00:23:08,250
Now let's go back to body. Uh, how do I just select this guy? Or so. No, I don't need to

105
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:31,750
torso limbs. Alright. How about arms? These are huge. These are way too big. Okay. Shit, it's

106
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:46,900
backwards. Okay. Well, it's backwards, but whatever. Weapons. Decorations. Armor. Gear. Okay. That looks

107
00:23:46,900 --> 00:24:04,789
alright. And this one looks good. Okay. That's team one. Now I want team two. Team two is going

108
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:13,240
to be animal base. This weird like frog thing. Animal scaling not recommended. Don't tell me what

109
00:24:13,240 --> 00:25:14,250
to do. It's a giant alligator. Okay. And you need a head. Uh, okay. Head. Just messing around. Okay.

110
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:27,259
Plasma beam T-Rex. Okay. So that's, those are the two captains. So this, you're, on the right side,

111
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:56,490
we're going to have two brontosaurus and three tiny triceratops. That's team captain right there.

112
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:12,859
So now over here, let's do spiders and shit. Yeah. Alright. Two huge scorpions. It's got to be fair.

113
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:36,259
And then three polar bears. No. One moderately sized polar bear. I think that's good for now.

114
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:52,710
Alright. So you guys ready? Here's the first fight I want to do. See what happens. Team one or team

115
00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:12,650
two. Give the big guys more HP. Oh, that's a good idea. That's true. How do I do that? Can I select

116
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:34,180
a unit? How do I select? Oh, let me just select the unit. Where are the bugs? Where are the bugs?

117
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:48,460
Okay. Emperor scorpion. Okay. So, but how do I, is this going to do it for the whole team?

118
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:59,880
Cancel bet. Why? What? AI mode default. HP multiplier. I don't think I can do anything

119
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:08,970
about it. It's before you place it. Oh, okay. So we'll do HP multiplier five for the big ones.

120
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:23,369
Okay. HP multiplier five, attack multiplier three. The big guys. I, I'm not, I'm not remaking these

121
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:34,789
guys. So that's too bad. We're just going to make a polar bear. HP multiplier five. All right.

122
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:41,059
Modern mammals. Okay. Polar bear. All right. It was a moderately size. It was, what was it? 1.1,

123
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:59,190
right? Doing two. It was 1.1. It was 1.1. What was it? 1.1 or 1.2? It was 1.1. That's fine.

124
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:20,420
All right. Now let's go over here. Let's change these guys. Five, three. Okay. Now I need the

125
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:42,259
three little triceratopsis. What were they? 0.3? 0.2 or 0.3? And these guys are going to be two

126
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:51,400
with attack multiplier one. Cause there's more of them. That's fair. It was 0.3. Okay. Oh,

127
00:29:51,400 --> 00:30:01,460
fuck. This is the wrong team. Okay. Who will win? No refunds. You know what I'm doing. I'll get it

128
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:09,589
right. Team two. Team, I got team two. All right. Team two, team two, team two, team two. Five,

129
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:28,779
three. All right. Are you ready? All right. Team one. I want to show, I want to see team one.

130
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:54,890
Team two, team one. All right. Are you guys ready? In three, two, one. Action. Team one kind of

131
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:09,779
got, wait, hold on a minute. It's still a fight. Shit. This is so stupid. The polar bear died

132
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:16,809
instantly. Why? Oh wait, it's anybody's game right now. It's the scorpions versus the broncos

133
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:39,140
versus. Oh, team two wins. It wasn't even close. All right. How about this one? A tetrazyrus,

134
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:49,480
a gigantic tetrazyrus with attack multiplier of 10 and health multiplier of 10 versus

135
00:31:52,359 --> 00:32:29,849
fucking 5,000 snakes. It's going to do one stomp. I don't think it's going to be one stomp.

136
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:45,140
Can I actually even fit 5,000 snakes on here? All right. It's starting to lag. Oh man. It's lagging.

137
00:32:45,220 --> 00:33:00,980
3090 omega low. Oh fuck. I can't do anymore. We'll say three. I can't do that much more.

138
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:21,609
How about, how does 300 sound? I'm going to overheat the 3090. Okay. 300 snakes is enough.

139
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:29,720
Okay. I got to get the camera somewhere where I don't have to move it because I'm not going

140
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:47,269
to be able to. Okay. Here we go. Are you ready? Up there attack so it's fair. No, up there attack.

141
00:33:47,269 --> 00:34:04,660
Why? One, two, three. Where are they going? Is he just stepping on them?

142
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:33,670
I can't tell who's winning. Are these all snake bodies? Some snakes are dead. I can't tell.

143
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:47,780
They're just like a plate of ramen. A potato computer. No, I don't have a potato computer.

144
00:34:48,500 --> 00:35:05,750
My CPU. Oh God. My poor CPU. I see blood. He's too big for them to hit.

145
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:17,369
Oh, what an epic battle. Listen to this big drop incoming. I think he killed them.

146
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,320
I don't think this is going to, this is going to, yeah, this is going to take a long time.

147
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:51,769
He's not even attacking anything. Is nothing dying? Is there a fast forward? I smell smoke.

148
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:01,989
That's funny. They're pushing it towards the edge. Wait, no, they're running away.

149
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:12,059
I don't know what to do about this. Should we just call this one a draw?

150
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:33,690
No? What do you mean no? It's obviously not a draw. Yeah, well, no one's really winning either.

151
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:50,139
Although there is a big mess of snakes over there. They all died in the same spot.

152
00:36:50,139 --> 00:37:11,639
But there's a shitload of movement though. Are those dead or alive? I think those are dead.

153
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:28,280
It's just a mat of hair from like the barber shop. Press H. H for health. Oh my fucking God.

154
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:38,329
This is going to take forever. They can't even like, it can't even hurt each other guys.

155
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:54,889
Refund. Refund. They can't even hurt each other. They can't hurt each other. It's refund. Refunded.

156
00:37:54,889 --> 00:38:09,460
I can't end the battle. There we go. Okay. Good. Holy shit. All right. Delete all this crap.

157
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:26,440
Clear it. Clear it all. Okay. Wow. All right. That's better. Okay. Let's do another one.

158
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,150
How about, let's do something easy, right? Something simple. I'm thinking saltwater

159
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:45,050
crocodile. A little bit bigger than that. One, let's do 2.0 scale. HP, crocodile would have a

160
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:52,710
little bit more HP, I think. Let's go with five and then attack multiplier two. Slow. Versus Komodo

161
00:38:52,710 --> 00:39:08,059
dragon. Komodo dragon would be a little bit less HP. I think it would hurt a little bit. Then we

162
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:26,980
hit a little harder. Okay. Who wins? Komodo dragon or alligator? You didn't apply the multipliers?

163
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:43,130
I thought I did. Didn't I? I didn't change the alligator. Alligator was five HP, but two attack.

164
00:39:43,130 --> 00:40:00,539
2.0. Yeah. All right. Which one is which? Team two is the Komodo dragon. Rock one was one attack.

165
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:08,710
All right. Here we go. Three, two. Let's get a good view of this. I want like a fucking

166
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:33,849
national geographic view. Three, two, one. Go. Oh shit. Oh, the Komodo dragon's done for.

167
00:40:36,780 --> 00:41:08,860
What? He won. Damn. Okay. All right. All right. Let's do, how about this? All right. How about,

168
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:18,139
okay. I'm going to make two different animals. Let's do humanoid. Okay. I want like human legs.

169
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:25,750
By the way, HP multiplier of three, attack multiplier of five. No, HP multiplier of 10.

170
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:42,219
Is it going to be kind of a human character? Big legs, strong, very quick, fast moving. Then

171
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:54,119
we need some torsos here. All right. Humanoid, humanoid torso. It's like plate armor. All right.

172
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:07,880
Carnivore plate armor. Okay. Uh, limbs. Let's go with wings. Yeah. Like these like big ass bat

173
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:35,300
wings. Okay. Oh, attack multiplier of one, three. Okay. Now let's do a tail. Tail's a little bit

174
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:51,530
weak. Attack multiplier of one is fine. Okay. Now let's do, uh, arms. Limbs. Let's do like a sword

175
00:42:51,530 --> 00:43:14,969
hand. This one. Attack multiplier, by the way, this attack multiplier of five. And then I need

176
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:29,369
a shield hand. All right. Fine. I'll just take a little random like weird claw. Attack multiplier,

177
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:50,179
by the way, of zero. How are we going? Weapons. Isn't there a handgun? FPS weapons. Okay. Is it

178
00:43:50,179 --> 00:44:01,989
going to be a handgun? Oh, a shotgun. That's, that's available over here, by the way. Two

179
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:22,840
shotguns are available to use. Fix the wings? What's wrong with the wings? Okay. This is,

180
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:40,730
okay. This is literally one of the monsters from Power Rangers. Big head. No, I don't want it to be

181
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:49,500
too big. Attack multiplier for the head is going to be two because there's going to be a bite. All

182
00:44:49,500 --> 00:45:00,519
right. You're kind of a skexy. That's all right. I think this one's ready to go. Any other accessories

183
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:19,449
or armor? Oh my, can I put this on your head? No, I don't think I can. All right. I can give you this.

184
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:39,539
I have a trash can and you can have little knee pads too. Okay. Not bad. You look good. How about

185
00:45:39,539 --> 00:46:17,340
gear? Decorations? Absolutely. Sunglasses? I don't think these are going to stay on. Okay.

186
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:32,340
What about hats? This is like a teen dinosaur and like a kid's cartoon. All right. That's it

187
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:43,400
for you. Good luck. I wish you the best of luck. Now we're going to go over here. Team two. Animal

188
00:46:43,400 --> 00:47:00,440
base. Arnivorous dinosaur. Okay. Spin neuron. I'm going to do, I'm going to say two of these,

189
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:15,110
which then we'll give a torso. Okay. Let's do humanoid torso. Does this count as two people?

190
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:35,880
Or can I fuse them together? Okay. I can't, I can't fuse them together. All right. Hold on. Weapons

191
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:59,210
one. Okay. Better idea. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stand back up. Stand up. Oh God. All right. I'm

192
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:10,659
going to redo it. I just want a torso with like a thousand like murder tentacles. Animal base. All

193
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:28,329
right. Here we go. This is what I want. Okay. Good. Now we want torso. Humanoid. Back multiplier

194
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:52,019
of one. Okay. That looks good. Don't fall over. Is it going to fall over? Back multiplier of four

195
00:48:52,019 --> 00:49:49,690
for these. Okay. This is fucking deranged. Why? Okay. All right. The head's going to be like a two.

196
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:05,610
That looks, it does not look good. That does not look okay. I definitely can't put the head here.

197
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:11,210
That's for sure. Cause I was thinking about that too. That was the place I was going to put it.

198
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:28,280
You can't do a snake. Okay. That's fine. I was the, is the elephant going to look just as bad?

199
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:41,829
You're so immature. I didn't do it. I just stated it was possible. That's fine. Okay. Now what about

200
00:50:41,829 --> 00:51:09,929
weapons and shit? Decorations? Sparkles? We just have LEDs. Okay. God damn it. I'm fine. This got

201
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:40,039
so mad for no reason. Now he's going to go in the back. Are you ready to place your bets? Let's

202
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:50,599
remind everybody what team everybody's on. Team one is, I don't remember. I actually don't remember.

203
00:51:52,139 --> 00:52:00,809
Team two is the cool radical dinosaur, I think. I don't remember. Nice third grade arts and crafts

204
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:10,260
project. Team one is left. Are you sure? That's wrong. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Team one is

205
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:22,460
the rad dino. Let me just make sure. All right. Yeah. Team one is rad dino. Team two is a serious

206
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:39,079
Sam torso guy. They both pretty evenly matched, I think. Team one is over here. Team two is over

207
00:52:39,079 --> 00:53:01,460
here. All right. Are you guys ready? Get a good view. Pull it back a little. In three, two, one.

208
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:16,469
Let's go. Oh Jesus Christ. Oh, he got him down. He got him down. He got him down. He got him down.

209
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:28,380
He's got him down. Him on his back is bad. That's real bad. He's just stabbing him in the chest.

210
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:49,690
Oh no. One. Team two is the winner. That's close. Nobody picked up the shotguns. I mean he did get

211
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:57,900
stabbed with every spear tentacle in the head. Every single one landed in his head. It was over

212
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:12,489
from the very beginning. Okay. So you know how this works, right? Team two moves on. Team one is

213
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:27,940
eliminated. Now we bring in a new character. All right. How do you guys feel about... Let's

214
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:36,789
just see if we can... How about lava golem? What do you think? You think he's got what it takes

215
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:43,300
versus a fucking giant lava golem? What do you think? How confident are you in this?

216
00:54:43,300 --> 00:55:04,460
HP at 10, attack multiplier five. That works. I wonder. He deserves upgrades if he wins? No,

217
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:21,239
I don't think so. Upgrade the winner. I don't think that's fair. That's J. Starting HP 20,000.

218
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:32,360
Holy shit. That's a lot. Okay. His HP multiplier has to be like eight. That's unfair. Okay. HP

219
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:46,139
multiplier of six, five. All right. It's a little bit of a challenge. What do you think?

220
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:59,670
Give the lava monster a gun. I would love to. I can't hand it to him. I can just put it in front

221
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:11,269
of him. The lava monster with a gun? All right. So you got team one. Lava monster with a weapon

222
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:26,340
available. Or you've got the one that won last time. Patch it? I don't think I can. Oh, they're

223
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:38,099
only for your FPS character. Yeah, we'll have the health bars on this whole time. Lava monster needs

224
00:56:38,099 --> 00:57:16,250
a hat. That's true. Okay. All right. Good luck. In three. Hold on. Let me get a good view. I'm

225
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:27,820
going to keep the health bars on so it's not a mystery. Three, two, one, action. Oh shit. Not

226
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:36,440
looking good. He's got him up in the air though. Oh, he's on the ground. Bad. Oh, he tripped. He

227
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,719
tripped over him. He tripped over him. He's got him by the leg. He's got him by his leg. He's going

228
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:46,150
to get him up just because of the leg only. He's stuck in his foot. Oh shit. He's going to win.

229
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:55,820
That's going to be close. Oh, he actually beat him. No way. That was close. He got the tendril

230
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:11,719
stuck in his foot. I did not think he was going to win that. You're eliminated. You're out. Okay.

231
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:37,139
How about the knockout artist? Okay. How about King? King Kung? Okay. King? King? Uh, we know

232
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:49,940
we need an attack multiplier of HP multiplier of seven, attack multiplier of six. Okay. He needs

233
00:58:49,940 --> 00:59:24,710
upgrades. The winner gets the loser's hat. That's a great idea. Add weapons. I can't for these guys.

234
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:50,980
No, I want sunglasses. I want a different hat too. Give me a crown. I like the Santa hat.

235
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:09,510
You already have a Santa hat. What a crown for the king. After this, if he wins three in a row,

236
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:19,369
he gets the crown. All right. It's time. You guys ready? Team one is the gorilla. Team two is uh,

237
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:32,659
I don't know. What do we name them? Guns and unit creator weapons too. Can they use these? Oh man.

238
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:46,619
Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, not for this one. I'm not going to throw a flame throw on the chest right

239
01:00:46,619 --> 01:01:03,719
now. No, not happening. Okay. You ready? Three, two, one, go. Well, that's a bad start. He can't

240
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:13,349
even walk. Holy shit. Oh no, he's going to drop him out of the arena. Wait a minute. Does that

241
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:21,460
count as a tie? Oh, I don't know who wins. Who won? Who won? Does that count as a tie?

242
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:36,500
It says I lost. So technically that's team two wins. It's a ring out. Oh God. Team one lost.

243
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:50,659
Yeah, it's a ring out. The monkey fell out first. That's uh, that we watched. It's a rematch.

244
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:58,199
All right, we'll do a rematch and I'll give it to you this way. Ready? This is what we'll do.

245
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:16,760
We'll prevent that from happening again. How confident are you now still

246
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:28,519
that the gorilla can take him on? Do you have confidence still? I'm not, I don't know. I'm

247
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:43,510
not so sure. You think these walls can hold them? Yeah, I do. What does it look like so far?

248
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:57,030
This is very skewed to team two. Do a cage match. We'll leave this for now. I'll do a cage match

249
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:15,449
later. Who will win? It's insanely skewed. This, look at the, look at how you, no confidence in

250
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:26,550
the gorilla at all. Even with the wall back there. This is, some of you guys have a chance to win

251
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:32,340
big right now and I mean big. Like really big. Because if this happens, holy shit,

252
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:39,530
some of you guys are going to get a major payout. Let's go. Three, two, wait, hold on,

253
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:50,219
it's still going. The gorilla sucks. I don't know. All it takes is one big punch to the face and

254
01:03:50,219 --> 01:04:10,360
it's over. One, two, um. No, it's gonna happen again. He's gonna, no, he's gonna just fall out.

255
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:26,019
He's still in, he's still in. He's still in it. Oh my god, he sucks. Holy shit, he's bad.

256
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:34,659
He was really bad. Why is he, why can he not walk? Why does he have so much trouble moving? He was

257
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:42,869
trying to go for this double axe handle move and he couldn't even do it to anything. All right,

258
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:58,940
goodbye. He moves on again and this time he gets glasses. I don't know if anyone's gonna be able

259
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:18,739
to beat him. He seems like, it seems too good. I can't put these on. This looks like I'm at the

260
01:05:18,739 --> 01:05:24,599
beach with my grandpa. They're just lying back in the lounge chair. We got here 10 minutes ago.

261
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:39,530
Just asleep already. And they wake up when it's time to leave. Those are team one glasses? Oh,

262
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:53,000
okay. Does that matter? All right, it's time for another, all right, this time I'm gonna create

263
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,599
something. We gotta, we have to rival this because he can't stick around this whole time.

264
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:31,860
This one's gonna have a weapon, but I'm gonna make it fair. How's, I don't know how this works.

265
01:06:31,860 --> 01:07:10,809
Wrong team? Oh shit, okay. Attack multiplier, machine gun, attack power two, okay. Oh shit,

266
01:07:10,809 --> 01:08:06,420
I needed to, whoops. Oh fuck it, it's gonna be just static on the ground. Anything else I wanna do?

267
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:29,380
Limbs? Okay, maybe he can fly. This can fly motherfucker, here let's go. So it doesn't do

268
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:45,909
that much damage but has a huge advantage. It can't walk, important to know. Press J.

269
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:55,560
Some attached weapons have attack multiplier not set to one. That's fine. Only a thousand starting

270
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:06,409
HP though? Oh, this is really, okay. Okay, so this thing has a thousand health, but will it just blow

271
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:21,829
this guy away in five seconds? Raises HP. I, can I even at this point? I don't know, I don't know.

272
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:31,590
I can't, it's too late. I already bet, that's where we're already in. Look, he, okay, this is

273
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:36,310
one of those scenarios where he's gonna surprise you and he's gonna die immediately. Or he has a

274
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,949
thousand health, he's gonna shoot in and miss like five times and he's gonna stab in the head

275
01:09:38,949 --> 01:10:09,500
and die. Here we go, ready? Three, two, one, let's get a good view. Action. Oh my god! Wow,

276
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:20,859
did the Tesla coil even do anything? Look at the wings. He's gone and he gets to have his,

277
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:48,779
he had a funny hat on. Damn, I didn't, okay. All right, so he gets his hat. More guns?

278
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:58,579
All right, we need to, we need to, oh, that's team one, god damn it. Okay, how about,

279
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:07,159
we have to dethrone this guy. All right, animal base, liven. We're gonna do attack,

280
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:11,930
let's see, what is the attack multiplier? Starting HP 2000. Okay, we're gonna do,

281
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:22,489
this is gonna be tricky. HP multiplier, so he's gonna have, he's got 7,000 HP. Okay, no, you know

282
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:27,399
what? We'll have him have more HP. 8,000. Well, hold on, don't, who will win? You don't even know

283
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:46,869
who it is yet. Oh, wait, team two, okay. Why you, you don't even know who it is? Why are you voting?

284
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:54,380
Okay, wyvern body, we're gonna do with the intelligence of a fucking man. And I mean,

285
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:12,090
this is tricky, this is where it gets weird for you guys. This is gonna have human intelligence.

286
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:43,159
Take that off, it's too heavy. Okay, I don't know about this guy. Okay, oh, and what's that? Two

287
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:59,050
plasma beam T-Rexes on his, on his front that do two attack multiplier times two. And he's got a

288
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:06,520
flamethrower on his forehead. This thing, by the way, this shit does fucking 10 attack multiplier,

289
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:15,510
but it is really small. You gotta get in real fucking close for that one. And then we're gonna

290
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:56,060
give him, that's it, that's it. Team one is wyvern, team two is our champion. Tail? No, no tail.

291
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:05,100
I think you guys seriously underestimate the fact that he has a flamethrower on his head.

292
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:34,539
That is a times 10 attack multiplier. If he gets in close, it's over. Where's his hat? I can't put

293
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:40,630
that on him. Okay, that's the flamethrower. Yeah, that is the flamethrower. That's a good call. All

294
01:14:40,630 --> 01:15:05,640
right, we ready? Good view. See all the action. Let's do it. Three, two, one, go. Okay, those are

295
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,399
strong. Those are really strong. Those are very strong. I don't even know where he's flying.

296
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:31,750
It's a victory lap. Okay, well, that was, here's your new hero. Down goes the giraffe. All right,

297
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:40,569
let's get another contender. Say goodbye. All right, team two. Let's see if he can handle one

298
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:57,779
of the, one of these. For instance, how about like gore hammer? Gore hammer. Attack HP multiplier of

299
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:14,840
10, attack multiplier of five. You think you can handle gore hammer? Team two is gore hammer,

300
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:31,159
team one. Let's take a look. That's pretty evenly matched. Gore hammer does not look that sturdy.

301
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:43,380
I will make sure that everybody watching is aware of this. Gore hammer may not actually be able to

302
01:16:43,380 --> 01:17:00,869
move. Okay, gore needs ranged weapons, but we don't, you don't know that. I'm taking the odds

303
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:08,119
on this one. Good luck. Look, I hope he runs in there and just hits the hammer down and just kills

304
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:14,439
him with a headshot. All right, here we go. Actually, a lot of people are voting for it.

305
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:26,149
Not really though. All right, remember team two is the gorilla. Oh, that's the previous one. Oh,

306
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:42,739
okay. Ready? Three, two, one, go. He can only shoot those once. All he has to do is get the

307
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:58,869
hammer over there and hit him one time. He's flying away. He's flying away. I have to nerf this guy.

308
01:17:58,869 --> 01:18:17,140
All right, well, it's not over yet. Okay, that was fucking pathetic. That was pathetic. That was

309
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,579
pathetic, but here we go. I'm going to do, I'm going to do you, uh, I'm going to, this is going

310
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:24,329
to make this really hard for you guys because I don't know what's going to happen. So I'm going

311
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:40,579
to make it really hard for you. Team two, HP multiplier of 10, attack multiplier of 10, two,

312
01:18:40,579 --> 01:19:03,659
two 3.0 for the hammer with 10, 10 times 10. What do you think? If they can walk, it's going to be

313
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:25,529
very interesting. The two, the hammer brothers make a 1.0 hammer so he can actually move. I think

314
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:40,010
they'll be able to move 3.0. They were like 5.0 before. That's asking for a lot. We'll see. I

315
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:45,800
don't know what's going to happen if they can actually walk around this tall or this small.

316
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:54,659
And yeah, Wyvern has a problem. They're already shaking. I'm not telling you how to bet. I didn't

317
01:19:54,659 --> 01:20:00,819
tell you what to bet on. I'm just here. I'm just them seeing this. I didn't tell you what was going

318
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:10,979
to happen. Imagine voting gorilla. I mean, if it ends up happening, somebody's going to, you guys

319
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:20,680
are going to, you're going to get a huge payday. Those are, those are more than 10 to one odds.

320
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:42,859
All right. Here we go. Good luck. 20 to one, three, two, one, go. He can fucking walk.

321
01:20:42,859 --> 01:20:54,180
Interesting. Interesting. Oh my God. It's over. He literally fell down. Wow.

322
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:16,979
Wow. That's a payout. Team two wins. It took two hammer hits. 8.2 million versus 1.3 million.

323
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:28,520
All right. So this is going to be, uh, now we're going to do, so the two, these two are champions

324
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:34,890
with 10, 10 at 3.0. We know that, right? But let's make it a little harder. Let's do an actual like

325
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:44,390
battle sequence, right? We're going to do, uh, what's the, what's the default for these guys?

326
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:59,239
Just one, right? Werewolves. Let's do, what's this? What are the stats on you? Six 50, one, one. Okay.

327
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:17,420
Let's go like this. Werewolves. Let's do one, two, three. Actually, you know what? Let's do HP

328
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:45,029
multiplier times 10. 10 werewolves versus, oh shit, look at that. 10 werewolves, werewolves versus

329
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:59,300
most dangerous fucking animal in the world. Hippopotamus. What's their scaling? Okay. Look at

330
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:26,409
that. Versus five hippopotamus. Five hippopotamus versus 10 werewolves. Make it six. Five is too

331
01:23:26,409 --> 01:23:42,579
much? I don't know, man. I don't think so. I think five is fair. Do three team to make it wacky. I

332
01:23:42,579 --> 01:23:50,810
don't think you can do channel points that way. Do one horse sized duck versus one duck sized horse.

333
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:57,210
Isn't it a hundred duck sized horses? Team one is a werewolves. Team two is hippopotamus.

334
01:23:57,210 --> 01:24:14,329
You just do a poll. Yeah, but people, there's no stakes. Okay. That was a quick vote. Here we go.

335
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:26,979
One, two, three. Oh shit. Oh, he took two with them though. They're dumping them. They're just

336
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:35,979
dumping off the edge. These werewolves, they're, they're smart. They're intelligent. Oh God.

337
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:44,869
Got a fight going on over there. No, they just dumped them. This is going to be close. This is

338
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:53,500
going to be close. He's taking three V1 and one V1 over there. What the fuck is he doing?

339
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,739
He just jumped off the cliff on his own. What a fucking moron. All right. Well, he's gone.

340
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:14,710
These two have to beat this hippo. Okay. Oh no. Fighting for his life on the edge.

341
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:19,619
One mistake though, when the hippo goes off. This is going to be anybody's game.

342
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:34,199
No, don't do it. Don't do it. Nice lunge. Oh, could the tables turn? Is he too heavy? I think he's

343
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:46,899
too heavy. I think the werewolves are doing more damage. Oh, so long King Bowser. Okay. This is

344
01:25:46,899 --> 01:26:02,069
bad news for the werewolves. Oh no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't get cocky. Don't get cocky

345
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:13,529
hippos. Bad move. Get away from the edge. I'm telling you, he does more damage. They have to

346
01:26:13,609 --> 01:26:17,050
throw him off. That was why they were doing that. The AI was like, we can't win. We got to throw

347
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:26,409
him off. He's just clinging, holding onto his leg and just biting his arm. Oh shit. This is bad.

348
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:45,979
Shit. Oh, he's going off. Yeah. He's getting gnawed on both arms and legs. It's over. It's not. He

349
01:26:45,979 --> 01:27:04,899
can't come back from this. It's over. Wait, we've got some friendly fire here. Friendly fire. This

350
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:25,270
is so stupid. Last ditch effort. Oh, he's gone. Hippos win. Yeah. If the wolves did not just jump

351
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:37,060
off the edge for no reason, this would have ended a lot differently. Hippos win. All right. We need

352
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:43,699
to do, we got to put them in a, like we got to block, we got to lock them in. Okay. We got to

353
01:27:43,699 --> 01:28:10,359
lock them in. Fences. Wait, I can make houses? I can make a castle? Wait, what? I put a hippo in a

354
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:43,000
castle and then have like a bunch of people try to conquer it? Oh, that's not going to work.

355
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:57,239
I think the team's tiny. Actually, I could probably do it. Do a tower. Okay. Yeah. So,

356
01:28:57,239 --> 01:29:01,449
okay. We're going to put a hippo up here. All right. Hippo is going to go up here.

357
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:30,699
Okay. One single hippo. Oh yeah. Easy. Easy. Two hippos versus, how about like, I don't know, like

358
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:46,899
humans? Commando bow. Okay. Versus a bunch of commandos. There's a bunch of tiny commandos.

359
01:29:46,899 --> 01:30:25,689
How about like 500 little tiny commandos? What about your CPU? I'll be all right. Okay. Nevermind.

360
01:30:25,689 --> 01:31:05,340
Two, 250 tiny commandos. Okay. Just kidding. 200 tiny commandos. Okay. Around 200 tiny commandos.

361
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:12,180
Okay. They have 1500 HP. Their attack multiplier is one. All right. They have to storm the castle.

362
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:41,159
Good luck. PowerPoint Andy. Give the castle a mortar. No, no. I don't think so. Teams are

363
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:57,319
backwards. Oh shit. Team one is, oh shit. Team two of the commandos, by the way. Yeah. Team two of

364
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:25,989
commandos. Team one of hippos. Give the hippos crowns. Absolutely. Okay. And then I want my FPS

365
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:43,979
avatar up here too. No, actually that's not going to work because I have to die. All right. Let's

366
01:32:43,979 --> 01:33:22,550
do it. Are we ready? Are we good? Are we ready? All right. Three, two, one. The commandos,

367
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:33,060
it's, it wasn't attached. They're not going to be able to get in here.

368
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:56,859
They alive? They're in there. Yeah. They're stuck in here. They're slowly getting in. They're slowly

369
01:33:56,859 --> 01:34:13,260
getting out. They're getting out. They're getting out. They're getting out. Oh my god. Well, that

370
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:21,300
didn't work. Commandos win. Okay. Well, I think I screwed that up a little bit, but whatever.

371
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:48,789
Now I got to clear this whole thing. Clear it. Clear it. How do I clear this? Clear it. Set wind.

372
01:34:48,789 --> 01:35:01,720
Hold on. New landscape. Okay. Yeah. All right. Coward coal. Can 10 coward coals beat one angry

373
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:27,029
Joe? We're doing defaults. Team one. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

374
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:53,699
Just one single angry Joe on team two. What do you think? Four hours? Four hours. What do you mean

375
01:35:53,699 --> 01:36:13,340
four hours? Oh, and by the way, did I mention angry Joe has a fucking helmet on? Um, never mind.

376
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:50,220
All right. It worked. Angry Joe versus 10 cowards. I don't think the cowards even fight, if I'm honest.

377
01:36:50,220 --> 01:37:00,520
Cowards have a shield wall though. That's, you're right. They do. Yes. Left team. The coward is team

378
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:13,939
one. Joe with the bad is team two. They could push him off. That's true. He's in a really

379
01:37:13,939 --> 01:37:29,060
vulnerable position. All right. Here we go. Three, two, one, go. Uh, the cowards don't even fight.

380
01:37:36,649 --> 01:38:10,779
Although, very important, he might walk him off the cliff. He fucking fell. You're really

381
01:38:10,779 --> 01:38:23,100
hoping for. He falls off the edge here. Uh, it's still possible. Uh oh. Big trip incoming.

382
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:45,130
He has to do this 10 times. I know. Oh shit. No, not enough. It wasn't enough. One slip up though

383
01:38:45,130 --> 01:39:08,340
and that's it. Nobody can, they can't even attack with their umbrellas. This is an easy win. Hold on.

384
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:26,949
Don't just say that. It's still time. It's still time for a monumental mistake. This is a real

385
01:39:26,949 --> 01:39:43,380
tragedy for the coward crew. Hold on. No, it's over. This is just slaughter. This is just

386
01:39:43,380 --> 01:40:02,890
slaughter. What was the point of this fight? Uh, it was to see if 10 people could fight this guy and

387
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:12,649
win, but they don't even fight. And I can't stop it because money is on the line. Channel point money

388
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:17,289
is on the line. And if there was even a 1% chance that he trips and falls over the edge, I can't

389
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:43,000
stop it. Oh, nope. There was your, that's the last opportunity. Go wins. All right, new fight.

390
01:40:43,000 --> 01:41:08,760
This time let's do, let's do another hard one. We're going to do berserker gorillas. How about,

391
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:20,199
you know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight berserkers, 1.5 scaled knockout

392
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:35,020
artist gorillas. Two of them. 2.0, Wolver, Wolver, Wolverilla, and Goro the Giant. By the way, at,

393
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:54,920
at 3.0. Can you not stand up? Okay. Wait. And you're going to be 10, you're going to be 5 HP,

394
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:10,149
two multiplier. Holy shit. He is fucking insane. Nevermind. That's too much. Okay. That's better.

395
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:25,020
Uh, we lost Wolverilla was 2.0, right? At default 2.0 Wolverilla. You stand over here. All right.

396
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:36,140
That's team gorilla, team one. So team two. Um, I'm going to throw you a curve ball here.

397
01:42:40,579 --> 01:42:56,069
Bugs versus a bunch of bugs. Way more bugs. Giant praying mantis and a shitload of spiders.

398
01:42:56,069 --> 01:43:07,779
Okay. Praying mantis at 2.0. I'm going to have to give you more multiplier there. Let's go to

399
01:43:07,779 --> 01:43:15,960
one more. Let's do three. The two attack multiplier. And yeah, we'll do, no, no, no.

400
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:28,500
You know what? Fuck that. How about one, five, five, giant enemy spider. No, 20. Good luck.

401
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:44,819
And then a shitload of little praying mantises at default. Two, three, four, five, six.

402
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:51,260
Why are they moving? Why are you moving? Stop moving. What are they moving for?

403
01:43:51,260 --> 01:44:05,270
Why are they moving? Stop moving. Okay. Well, whatever. Six praying mantises and are they

404
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:18,149
attacking? And then a bunch of little ants. I don't know why they, why are they attacking?

405
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:28,489
Are they, they're too small? Oh, okay. Hold on. Let me fix this. All right. One medium size

406
01:44:28,489 --> 01:45:00,840
giant praying mantis and then wrong team. Shit. Did I say one? I meant two. And then a shitload

407
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:13,640
of ants. Tiny. We're talking like 0.2. We're talking like 50 of them. 30 is fine. All right.

408
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:22,340
The spider is insane. No, they're on the right team. Although look at this guy though. I don't

409
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:49,260
know. And one worm all the way back. The one giant worm, two giant worms and an extra gorilla. Get

410
01:45:49,260 --> 01:46:05,109
ready. I'm excited for this one. I don't know. I don't want to influence the vote, but I have

411
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:19,449
what I would pick. I think we have to stay high up for this one. I don't think I can do very much

412
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:32,460
camera work on this. Wow. All right. I was going to say gorilla because we don't know if he throws

413
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:39,479
things or not. He might like throw rocks. I don't know. Three, two, one, begin.

414
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:56,100
What the fuck are you doing? What was he attacking that guy? All right. I don't understand.

415
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:02,979
They're too big. I think the spiders won, but what happened? Was he on the wrong team?

416
01:47:03,619 --> 01:47:14,890
Was he on the wrong team? No, he's on the right team. He just started swinging at him and slashing

417
01:47:14,890 --> 01:47:34,460
at him. Scimitar guy pulled an ant up. Oh, okay. All right. We're going to try this again with a

418
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:48,220
more dialed back gorilla or the giant. 2.0. 2.0. Giant enemy, giant enemy spider is going to go to

419
01:47:48,220 --> 01:48:14,359
also to 2.0. No huge shit. It's impossible. No, 3.0. I can do 3.5. 4.0. 3.5. Wait, wait, wait,

420
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:36,260
wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Good. That means I got a team. God damn one. 2.0. Spin him around

421
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:46,890
and I want him 10, 10. No, he's got 42 fucking thousand HP. No, let's do four, four. Still way

422
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:55,829
too much. Two, 84. Okay. Two attack multiplier of two. All right. Now we can actually do it for real

423
01:48:55,829 --> 01:49:14,470
this time. Ready? You guys ready to vote? Show stats. I think it's pretty evenly matched considering

424
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:24,010
that the bugs do more damage, but the giant enemy spider is way less powerful than Goro.

425
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:46,550
Let's see. The answer on the right team. Look at the circles. Three, two, one, action.

426
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:57,060
It is a pull. Okay. Now I understand what happened. All right. Looking good. Just the little bugs.

427
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:04,069
Don't walk off the edge. Giant enemy spider is currently attacking two gorillas. We still,

428
01:50:04,069 --> 01:50:12,710
look, it's still plenty of game left. Scimitar is still alive. So is Goro the giant. I, this is

429
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:19,619
Goro's game to win right here, I think. No, they instantly killed him. The bugs win. Fuck. That

430
01:50:19,619 --> 01:50:24,279
wasn't even close. Oh, he's doing like the Peter Griffin family guy thing when a family guy character

431
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:35,670
falls down. Okay. That was, that was embarrassing how bad that was. They lost very, very, very, very

432
01:50:35,670 --> 01:51:12,550
badly. Can you last versus two? 10, 10. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How's that?

433
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:30,170
Good luck. Two, 10, 10. They're Resinosaurus. 12,000? Yeah. It says 12,000, doesn't it?

434
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:40,729
I don't know if the bird sounds. I, I can't, oh, I just realized what you're talking about.

435
01:51:40,729 --> 01:52:05,180
Oh, and by the way, did you notice? It's really fucking windy out. It's rigged. All right. Wait,

436
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:08,539
wait, wait. I'll turn, all right. Not, not for this one. For the next one. You're right. That's,

437
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:13,670
that's just like, you're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, oh,

438
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:46,250
not yet. I can't turn the bird sounds off. One, two, two and a half. And you guys were concerned

439
01:52:46,250 --> 01:53:12,439
about that. One of them's already dead. Okay. Bugs win. I would be shocked if they won again.

440
01:53:12,439 --> 01:54:07,319
I'm just going to be very clear. And 250 angry Joes, which by the way, by the way, one of them,

441
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:13,239
captain, he's covered in fucking armor, surrounded with armor and he's going to have guns and weapons

442
01:54:13,239 --> 01:54:41,750
all over him. He's getting into the hockey pads. It was like, he can play with like his big brother.

443
01:54:42,229 --> 01:55:45,300
The Legion of angry Joes with one angry Joe dialed up to a thousand or a couple of bugs.

444
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:57,270
Oh, we are the gal here in friend tree. We're the ones that stomp on those bugs and camaraderie.

445
01:55:57,270 --> 01:56:47,159
Captain needs a hat. We're ready. That's in three, two, one. Oh shit. One of them went flying.

446
01:56:47,159 --> 01:57:11,380
Holy shit. What? I don't even know what they're attacking. One of them is getting shot with the

447
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:18,390
machine gun multiple fucking times. He's lighting up. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

448
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:55,079
It's a fucking rave. What are they fighting? There's nothing even fighting each other.

449
01:57:55,079 --> 01:58:15,979
Are they trying to hit the bugs on the ground? Oh shit. They're going to make it. Oh fuck. Here

450
01:58:15,979 --> 01:58:25,609
they come. All right. This is there. There's a guy right now going like this, like way in the back.

451
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:49,699
There's a guy. She's like fucking freaking out over there. Wait, what happened? They won. There's

452
01:58:49,699 --> 01:58:53,699
something. The doors like bending down too. You know, like it's always just like, it's like

453
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:09,989
their hair is like going fucking crazy. That person's having a good time. A really good time.

454
01:59:09,989 --> 01:59:20,819
Fire the cameraman. All right. Here we go. All right. We'll do.

455
01:59:21,539 --> 01:59:47,430
You got instantly overcrowded. This is too many. All right. Let's get rid of the dance guy angry

456
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:52,439
Joe's versus commandos. All right. Oh yeah. That's a good, that's a good one. Or how about

457
01:59:52,439 --> 02:00:17,050
like just a, okay. 15 commandos versus 250 Joe's. Wrong team. God damn it.

458
02:00:39,609 --> 02:01:07,270
Okay. And we'll give them a, like a fence or something to hide behind. Attic. Wait,

459
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:19,960
are these turnstiles? Hold on. I can make them have to go through turnstiles? No. Wind on.

460
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:49,979
Enough of this one. Hold on. It's fucking good enough. Whatever. Okay. Now we're going to put

461
02:01:49,979 --> 02:02:02,630
mines where the mines missile launcher. Are there mines? Yeah. Then land mines. Okay.

462
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:18,090
This is quite a bet I would be making. I don't know if I don't know if I would make any of these

463
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:26,539
bets. I would, I'm going to say right now that I don't, I would not vote for the angry Joe's.

464
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:49,140
Okay. I'll make it a little better. Okay. There I would not vote for the angry Joe's. This is a

465
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:58,819
tough one. Let me make it easier for you. Let me make it harder. Actually. Now it's actually a hard

466
02:02:58,819 --> 02:03:11,770
decision and we're going to remove this wall here. Go easy. All right. Let's see. Put your money where

467
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:34,090
your mouth is then. Team two is commando. Team one is angry Joe. There's way too many Joe's.

468
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:41,289
I don't know, man. We've seen countless things so far. We've seen things that looked impossible to

469
02:03:41,289 --> 02:03:53,619
fight die instantly. This is a toss up for me. I don't know. On one hand, are they going to get

470
02:03:53,619 --> 02:03:58,260
overwhelmed by the Joe's or on the second hand are all the mines going to blow up and kill everybody

471
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:01,460
and there's going to be one commando left just sniping all the Joe's running around.

472
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:30,380
In three, two, one, go. Oh no. They're going to hit the other one. The bodies are in the way.

473
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:36,939
This is fucking heinous. They can't move because there's too many bodies. Holy shit.

474
02:04:48,680 --> 02:05:02,890
What's with the gas? That was fucking horrible. They just started turning into cement. Human cement.

475
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:12,090
Oh yeah. Okay. Well, there were too many Joe's. If they weren't that many Joe's, it probably would

476
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:27,180
have been a little bit closer. Wall of flesh. All right. We're going to get rid of the fucking

477
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:32,279
landmines are not fair. Let's just be real. We're going to get rid of the landmines. We're going to

478
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:39,079
keep one landmine right here. We're going to get rid of a bunch of the Joe's and we're going to make

479
02:05:39,079 --> 02:06:09,510
one big Joe. One large Joe who has a two and a two. You ready? No, he needs way more help than that.

480
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:19,159
Times 20 fucking health multiplier. Times 50 health multiplier. Let's put him far away though.

481
02:06:19,159 --> 02:06:28,220
All right. He's got 10 fucking thousand health. All right. Let's go. Team one is Joe's. Team two

482
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:41,819
are the commandos. This is too easy now. Well, we'll find out. I have removed a bunch of the Joe's.

483
02:06:44,729 --> 02:07:10,970
Team one Joe, team two commandos. I believe in big Joe. I believe in mega Joe. All right. Here we go.

484
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:23,770
What happens? Three, two, one. Lock the camera. Go. Well, he slipped. There's an extra mine over

485
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:37,909
there, but it's okay. It wasn't that bad. Oh, they're reloading. What's with the gas? What the fuck

486
02:07:37,909 --> 02:07:55,750
just happened? What? Wait, what? What happened? What was the gas? They can't get through. Dude,

487
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:59,989
I'm telling you, if that angry Joe gets over here, it's over. Are they even hitting anybody?

488
02:08:00,789 --> 02:08:18,970
How did they get out? Do not spread out. Are you stupid? Oh, gosh. They're all stuck.

489
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:23,369
There's too many Joe's again. There's too many dead bodies. He is flopping over here

490
02:08:23,369 --> 02:08:33,739
very slowly. He gets over here, man. It's going to be trouble. Well, they're all dead. Okay. Well,

491
02:08:33,739 --> 02:08:54,010
whatever. Sorry for all the Joe believers. There was an extra landmine. I'm going to delete that

492
02:08:54,010 --> 02:09:10,260
one and delete that one. And we're going to get rid of the fence there. But to make up for it,

493
02:09:10,260 --> 02:10:35,750
they get one of these. That's not going to work. Let's make it fair. Wrong team. It's going to

494
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:48,859
disaster. They're very vulnerable, but they have a ton of firepower. And we're also going to,

495
02:10:48,859 --> 02:10:59,699
I'm going to remove another like 10 to 20 of them. They stopped getting all bunched up. All right.

496
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:05,220
Begin the vote. Team two versus team one. You've seen how it plays out. I think we're ready to go.

497
02:11:05,859 --> 02:11:22,890
There's no way that big Joe is going to be able to move. I think he can.

498
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:41,130
Does it look like pretty even actually. If I had a vote right now, I'm putting it on the commandos.

499
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:48,409
I'm just going to give you honesty here. They have machine guns and they have blisters on their head.

500
02:11:48,409 --> 02:12:19,340
Three, two, one, go. Uh-oh. Oh, shit. Oh, the gas. The flamethrower instantly killed them.

501
02:12:19,420 --> 02:13:23,319
Damn. I would have lost. Fire is OP. Yeah. I was sleeping. I think the commandos just do the gas.

502
02:13:39,739 --> 02:14:06,779
Oh shit. Big Joe, big Joe almost out. Stupid as shit ever. All right. One, I'll do one more.

503
02:14:06,779 --> 02:14:11,020
One duck sized Joe versus one horse sized, a hundred horse sized ducks, whatever it is.

504
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:23,380
One duck sized tiger versus a hundred horse sized. I don't know. Get this turned off.

505
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:53,619
Okay. One duck sized, one horse sized boar versus a hundred duck sized buffalo.

506
02:15:36,779 --> 02:15:47,159
Worst noise runner up. That's fine. I was trying to do a 56K modem. That's what it

507
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:50,520
started. That sounded like that for a couple of seconds and I was like, well,

508
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:58,260
fuck it. I'm just going to just really commit to this. All right. Here we go.

509
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:36,409
Can they wait? Can they walk? Okay. Well, that was fun. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'll see you

510
02:16:36,409 --> 02:16:42,260
guys tomorrow. We're going to play the pawn shop game tomorrow. We're going to play, uh,

511
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:49,319
no umbrellas allowed. It's a game where you have to like haggle, sell things, buy things.

512
02:16:49,319 --> 02:17:15,180
It looks really fun. I'll do one more. One more climactic one. Sure. This is going to be the final

513
02:17:15,180 --> 02:18:00,760
time for you to bet as well. Drop sticks. I know. I'll get them. Wrong fucking team. No, it's not.

514
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:49,780
Right team. Okay. Who do you think went to increase their health? Oh, whatever. Hippo is

515
02:18:49,780 --> 02:19:14,469
two OP. I'll change that. Here we go. Yeah. One more vote. I'm sitting there like, all right,

516
02:19:14,469 --> 02:19:35,659
let's go. It's just a sci-fi channel original. But what if, what if the polar bear had a missile

517
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:50,809
launcher? It's like, uh, like Pixar movies from like 2001. But what if we made the claws of the

518
02:19:50,809 --> 02:20:06,069
polar bear three inches longer? Then it would kill the hippo. Yeah. Isn't that weird? Not really.

519
02:20:06,069 --> 02:20:29,370
Three, two, one, go. It's not even a contest. Oh my God. Sci-fi channel original.

520
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:50,940
Oh, that was my biggest bet of the night. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. That's it.

521
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:58,760
I'm done. But what if we do this? But what if we give the same exact machine gun that we gave the

522
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:07,399
hippo to the polar bear? Would the polar bear's aerodynamic way of moving prevent the hippo's

523
02:21:07,399 --> 02:21:15,180
slow and coordinated movement from being shot? Let's put it inside of our simulator.

524
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:26,840
Stay tuned for Kathy Mitchell's copper pan infomercial because this is absolutely airing

525
02:21:27,719 --> 02:21:44,229
at 3 a.m. Are we betting on this one? Keep stalling. I got to get more points.

526
02:21:48,549 --> 02:21:58,950
Don't call Aaron at 3 a.m. No, it would be, we don't call Armin at 3 a.m. That's Armin saying

527
02:21:58,950 --> 02:22:04,809
Aaron. So like it would be you call Armin and Armin thinks it's Aaron calling and it gets it

528
02:22:04,809 --> 02:22:26,309
like really concerned. You've got that bit wrong. All right. Three, two, one, go. It's not even

529
02:22:26,309 --> 02:22:33,879
fucking close. It was close. It was actually kind of close. All right. I'm out of here. Goodbye.

530
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:40,200
I'm going to get chopsticks in a second. I mean, what the fuck? Wait, why did he win that one?

531
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:47,340
Why did he win that one? What? Holy shit. He's winning them now. I didn't do anything different.

532
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:56,600
I just pressed the button. No, no, there's no more betting. There's no more. Maybe too late.

533
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:25,209
What? No, we're not betting anymore. Too late. Already did it. Already bet. What? I'm leaving.

534
02:23:25,209 --> 02:23:36,979
I'm done. You guys were betting? No, no more betting. No, refund, refund, refund, refund.

535
02:23:36,979 --> 02:23:44,149
I'm not even playing. All right. I'm going to beer up. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to get

536
02:23:44,149 --> 02:23:51,559
the chopsticks, prove that I can use them, give them times 5,000 HP. I can't even do that right

537
02:23:51,559 --> 02:24:00,780
now. We're going to make this fair. We're going to make this absolutely completely fair. We are

538
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:07,239
going to do hippopotamus. This is the last bet of the night. I make it fucking count. We're going

539
02:24:07,239 --> 02:24:20,340
to do a 4.0 hippopotamus at times 100 multiplier health, more times a thousand multiplier health,

540
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:30,889
which would give this 900,000 health. And then our polar bear is also going to be the same size.

541
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:41,450
Was it 4.0? Same distance. Exactly. Different team. Let me redo this because people are going

542
02:24:41,450 --> 02:24:52,020
to get confused. 4.0 polar bear. 500,000 HP. We have to do a little bit more than that.

543
02:24:53,540 --> 02:25:10,389
So he has a million health in the hippopotamus. Team two, 4.0. Although that's not fair. 3.5.

544
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:16,819
Same distance. Separate team. You've got 1.8 million health. That's not fair. We're going to do

545
02:25:16,819 --> 02:25:25,979
1100. Now they both have just about, there's a small disadvantage. They're just about a million

546
02:25:25,979 --> 02:26:35,959
health each. Plasma. We're going to do missile launchers. You like that strategy? Okay. So that's

547
02:26:37,899 --> 02:26:46,709
mega, mega, mega. That's mega. Mega what? I don't think that's just so powerful just yet.

548
02:26:46,709 --> 02:28:19,379
Fence him in. It's a good boy. Barnacles. Team fucking one for the love of God. Okay. And then

549
02:28:20,860 --> 02:29:36,540
rockets. A ton of them. I gotta redo it. Shit. The hippo looks actually stronger.

550
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:49,780
Okay. Fence. I need fences. So our mechanical gigantic monster fight. Let's do with a fence.

551
02:29:49,780 --> 02:30:34,329
Okay. Fence. Static. Can't be moved. It has to be fucking huge. Okay. Team one. You know who it is.

552
02:30:34,329 --> 02:30:42,739
Polar bear. More missile and plasma oriented. Team two is the hippo. Heavy machine gun fire

553
02:30:42,739 --> 02:31:03,059
and light cruise missiles. Get a good view. I think right here looks about good. Right about

554
02:31:03,059 --> 02:31:28,250
there. Looks good to me. So this is it. Hippo is two. Right. Hippo is two. Polar bear is one.

555
02:31:28,250 --> 02:32:03,100
And three, two, one. He didn't fall out. He's still in. Oh my God. He's done. It's over.

556
02:32:03,739 --> 02:32:25,700
He's done. He's not getting out of that. They didn't even scratch each other. Oh my God. Well,

557
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:34,569
that was insane. That was crazy. I'm gonna go get chopsticks. That's the end of the stream pretty

558
02:32:34,569 --> 02:32:40,659
much. I will close the stream out. We'll see you tomorrow for the pawn shop game. Seems like a chill

559
02:32:40,659 --> 02:32:46,469
fun game to experience. So see you tomorrow. Same time. 2 p.m. Pacific. I'll be right back.

560
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:54,459
I've got my bowl. By the way, this is going to be difficult because I got little carrots that are

561
02:34:54,459 --> 02:35:02,920
wet and slippery. So if I can pick these up, then you know I know what I'm doing. Let me just exit

562
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:17,399
the game and quit the game. They're little baby carrots and they're wet and they're very slippery.

563
02:35:17,399 --> 02:35:39,129
So let me come back. I'm gonna turn the exposure up. Okay, there we go. Okay, hi. Let's move you

564
02:35:39,129 --> 02:35:47,049
over here. So just wanted to show everybody I've got a bowl with carrots in it and I've got

565
02:35:47,049 --> 02:35:55,319
chopsticks. So as you can see, let's just go ahead and get one of these carrots. It's very simple.

566
02:35:55,319 --> 02:36:07,270
It's very easy as you see. And these are slip. Oh, there's probably hair on it. There's probably

567
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:23,379
hair on it. They're slippery. There's probably hair on that because like I have like Otto has hair.

568
02:36:23,379 --> 02:36:31,819
They're really slippery. But you get the idea. If this was a piece of sushi, I'd be fine.

569
02:36:31,819 --> 02:36:56,069
I win. What do you mean fraud? What are you talking about? See you tomorrow. Off camera

570
02:36:56,069 --> 02:37:04,329
chopstick double. I told you I could use them. What do you think I am? These are good. They were

571
02:37:04,329 --> 02:37:15,049
a shitload of subs today and I missed a bunch of them. I missed almost all of them. Carrots are

572
02:37:15,049 --> 02:37:25,110
really hard to eat. They take forever. But pawn shop game tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Next week,

573
02:37:25,110 --> 02:37:30,600
we're going to do Sims 3 Mod Hell and Delta Rune. I'm not going to play it tomorrow. I'm going to

574
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:35,959
play chapter one on my own time to refresh my brain. But we'll see you tomorrow maybe.

575
02:37:35,959 --> 02:37:52,500
Carrots take, oh no, carrots take so fucking long to eat. There we go. I got through them.

576
02:37:57,930 --> 02:38:03,639
Yeah. I want to, how long is it? Okay. So now that it's out, I have a question. So now that

577
02:38:03,639 --> 02:38:09,860
Delta Rune is out, it came out like three or four hours ago. Has anybody beaten it? How long is it?

578
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:15,579
Do we know? Like have people completed it? I know it just came out like three or four hours ago. But

579
02:38:15,579 --> 02:38:27,559
I'm just kind of, I'm trying to figure out how long the chapter is. Is it less than six hours?

580
02:38:27,559 --> 02:38:55,719
I have not yet. I'm not sure. Probably like four hours based off the last one. Okay. Four to five

581
02:38:55,719 --> 02:39:09,500
hours. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah. Let's raid somebody. Let's throw a raid out there. I haven't

582
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:17,979
raided somebody in like three weeks. So let's raid. Who's live? Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

583
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:25,799
Vinny playing Cyberpunk 2077. Do people still play that game? Vinny, Vinny, Vinny. Let's go

584
02:39:25,799 --> 02:39:49,059
say hi to Vinny. What, people still play Cyberpunk? Did they update it? I played Cyberpunk today.

585
02:39:49,059 --> 02:40:00,229
I did not play Cyberpunk today. All right. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Go say hi to Vinny.

586
02:40:00,229 --> 02:41:07,350
Take care of yourselves. Goodbye. Good night. See you later.
